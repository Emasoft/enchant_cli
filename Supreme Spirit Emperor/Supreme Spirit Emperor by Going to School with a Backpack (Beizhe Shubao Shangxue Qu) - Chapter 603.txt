“Hum…” Fierce demonic energy surged violently within Luo Tian’s body, colliding with his mind-sea and attempting to erode it.

“Can’t afford to be idle!” Luo Tian sighed bitterly, beginning to circulate the Mortal Darkness Arts passed down by Jinghang. As he activated the technique, the wild demonic energy gradually calmed. Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, exhaling a long sigh. In his dantian, a small black figure continuously inhaled and exhaled, leaving Luo Tian marveling at the ferocity of the Mortal Darkness Arts.

“Transformed into a demon cultivator, my strength has indeed improved significantly!” Luo Tian murmured, assessing his cultivation. His gaze turned to the blackened sky. The Book of Epochs had been exposed; Luo Tian knew that Bu Tian Xianwang could not remain ignorant. By retrieving the Book of Epochs, he was gambling on whether Bu Tian Xianwang harbored greed for it. If so, his life would be in peril; if not, he might survive.

“Alas…” Luo Tian felt a slight relief, his gaze falling upon a towering black door at the end of the arena. He sighed inwardly, believing he might escape this death trap. With a burst of speed, he leapt toward the black door.

…Inside a dark hall, a crimson figure sat cross-legged, his face handsome, clad in blood-red robes. His eyes carried a hint of seductive menace. Above his head floated a black longsword. If Luo Tian were here, he would recognize this sword as the one Jinghang had wielded—his inheritance from Jinghang revealed its name: the Mortal Darkness Sword, a treasure of the Tianmo Sect. Moreover, this sword held another identity in Hell: one of the Seven凶Swords, the "Questioning Demon Sword," forged by a peak figure of the demon path. Ranked sixth among the Seven凶Swords, it was infamous.

“My fortune is truly astonishing! Not only did I arrive here, but now I am so powerful. If I met an old acquaintance, a single touch would end their life!”

“Only regrettable that those two pills were lost. They must have been treasures, but they fled!”

“Still, no problem. This sword will soon be mine! Ha ha!” The youth laughed loudly, blood qi surging to envelop the black sword.

Luo Tian raced forward for a quarter of an hour, bursting through the black door. Waves of energy struck his body, causing him to vanish from the arena.

In an instant, Luo Tian appeared atop the dark hall. As he arrived, the black sword—previously subdued by the youth—shuddered violently, as if attempting to break free from his control.

“What’s happening?” The youth opened his eyes, confusion etched on his face. He had been in this hall for some time, refining the black sword, but never before had such a phenomenon occurred.

“Subdue it!” The youth roared again, blood qi surging, filling the entire hall with thick crimson energy.

“Where is this place?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, surveying the dimly lit hall with intricate decorations.

“None of them have emerged?” Luo Tian pondered, surprised that he was the first to escape the death trap.

“I am the first!” A hint of amusement flickered in Luo Tian’s eyes. He surveyed the hall, but soon noticed signs that others had been here—boxes on shelves were open, their treasures stolen.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian entered the hall, Longyuan Sword’s resonance intensified, nearly breaking free from its sheath. He calmed it with a touch.

“How to exit?” Luo Tian had no choice but to draw Longyuan Sword, hoping it would guide him.

“Hum…” Longyuan Sword radiated battle intent, transforming into a beam of divine light that surged toward a corner of the hall. Meanwhile, as Longyuan Sword flew out, the Mortal Darkness Sword trembled again, startling the youth. He gazed at the sword’s fierce battle intent.

“What’s this? I feel an ominous premonition…” The youth’s eyelids twitched, and he desperately suppressed the Mortal Darkness Sword.

“Boom!” The hall’s wall was shattered by Longyuan Sword, revealing a deep passage.

“Hum…” Longyuan Sword transformed into a streak of black light, plunging into the dark passage. Luo Tian furrowed his brows and followed it in.

“Ten zhang… a hundred zhang…” Luo Tian’s speed was swift; the passage had no obstacles but stretched endlessly. As he entered, the Mortal Darkness Sword trembled violently again.

“Almost there! Don’t let anything go wrong—keep suppressing it!” The youth roared, desperately subduing the black sword.

Yet the Mortal Darkness Sword was one of the Seven凶Swords; it could not be easily controlled. It writhed free, and even the youth felt increasingly strained.

“Boom!” Finally, Luo Tian burst from the dark passage, pushing open the hall’s door and standing within it.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian appeared, the Mortal Darkness Sword finally broke free from the youth’s control, flying toward Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian!” The youth’s face darkened; he suddenly stood up, spotting Luo Tian at the hall’s entrance. His voice was sharp with disbelief.

Chapter 2282: Struggle for the World’s Heart ()

“Hum…” The black Mortal Darkness Sword hovered before Luo Tian, clashing with Longyuan Sword. Thunderous sounds echoed through the hall as both black longswords floated before Luo Tian, confronting each other.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, sensing an intimate aura from the Mortal Darkness Sword. He extended a hand, and the sword fell into his grasp, its icy chill seeping into his palm.

“Mortal Darkness Sword?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed in confusion, instantly recognizing it. He now understood why Longyuan Sword had reacted so strongly.

“Luo Tian!” As Luo Tian pondered, a sharp voice echoed in his ears, drawing his gaze to the hall.

“Tu Feiyang!” Luo Tian gasped, staring at the youth clad in blood-red robes—none other than the Heir of the Blood Clan, Tu Feiyang.

“Again you! You’ve stolen my opportunity again! What did I do to you in a past life!” Tu Feiyang’s eyes burned with madness, his voice rising in a roar. He had never expected to meet Luo Tian here; the sword he was about to refine had slipped from his grasp, now flying toward Luo Tian.

“How many times has this happened, Luo Tian? You’re not human! I hate you!” Tu Feiyang bellowed, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian as if he wished to devour him. Yet even with his current status as a half-step Xianwang, Tu Feiyang dared not attack Luo Tian due to the shadows left by their past encounters.

“Feiyang Senior, it’s been a while. How have you been?” Luo Tian felt awkward, addressing Tu Feiyang. He hadn’t expected to meet him here.

“That sword—my sword!” Tu Feiyang roared, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

“My sword? My sword…” Luo Tian waved a hand, sending the Mortal Darkness Sword flying toward Tu Feiyang.

Luo Tian felt a bit embarrassed; he had lost the inheritance of the Jietian Sect’s master on Mount Jietian and the Blood Lord’s inheritance in the Sea of Blood. Tu Feiyang had always been the one to lose out. Tu Feiyang rarely feared anyone, but Luo Tian was an exception—every time he appeared, his opportunities were snatched away.

The Mortal Darkness Sword shot forth, radiating light before instantly returning to Luo Tian’s side, circling him.

“Feiyang Senior, this isn’t my fault… it flew here on its own!” Luo Tian gazed at the sword, exasperated. It seemed to have chosen Luo Tian as its master.

“You… are mocking me!” Tu Feiyang’s face darkened, his voice sharp.

“Feiyang Senior, we are both from the Nine Domains. Now in Xianrealm, we should support each other!” Luo Tian sighed helplessly, holding the sword.

“My two years of refinement—two years! You come and take it!” Tu Feiyang groaned, nearly vomiting blood. Previously, Luo Tian would have contested for it, but now even he didn’t fight—treasures simply flew to Luo Tian.

The more Tu Feiyang thought, the more he seethed, his eyes reddening with fury.

“I’ll fight you!” Tu Feiyang leapt into the air, charging toward Luo Tian. His half-step Xianwang aura made Luo Tian flinch slightly.

“Feiyang Senior, I truly don’t blame you… I understand your feelings. But I want to return this sword to you, yet it insists on following me—I can’t help it!” Luo Tian sighed, helpless. He already had Longyuan Sword; the Mortal Darkness Sword was optional, offering only a few additional techniques.

“Get out…!”

“You get out…!” Tu Feiyang roared, his blood-red hand pressing down toward Luo Tian.

“Boom!” Luo Tian would not sit idle; he extended a hand, demonic energy surging. The cold aura made Tu Feiyang regain clarity, suddenly recalling that his opponent was Luo Tian—the former hegemon of the Nine Domains.

“What does it matter? I am a half-step Xianwang, while he is merely at the peak of True Immortal!” Tu Feiyang realized instantly and clashed with Luo Tian.

Though Luo Tian was at the peak of True Immortal, his strength was but a hair’s breadth away from half-step Xianwang. With Jinghang’s inheritance, he was no match for a half-step Xianwang—though still unaccustomed.

Boom, boom, boom… The two clashed within the hall, their blows echoing through its walls. The building began to crumble under their power.

“Unsurpassed, Tu Feiyang! You are truly formidable!” Luo Tian mused as they exchanged dozens of blows, yet he had not gained the upper hand.

“Unsurpassed, Luo Tian! Though one level below, you match me!” Tu Feiyang marveled as well. He had not expected Luo Tian to remain so strong.

“Hum…” As they clashed, waves of energy emanated from the hall’s entrance. A battered figure appeared—Fuxingyue, who had entered the death trap with Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian!” Fuxingyue shouted, spotting the two locked in combat.

“Tu Feiyang!” Fuxingyue’s eyes narrowed, surprised to see Tu Feiyang here.

“What’s happening?” Fuxingyue demanded, rushing to Luo Tian.

“Don’t question it! This fool is mad—he wants to fight me! Help subdue him first!” Luo Tian clashed with Tu Feiyang, both colliding with the hall’s wall.

“Fine!” Fuxingyue nodded, his divine spear radiating golden light as he charged toward Tu Feiyang.

“You’re despicable!” Tu Feiyang roared, drawing a blood-red longsword to fight Fuxingyue and Luo Tian.

Two against one, Tu Feiyang could not withstand their assault, retreating step by step as his body collided with the hall’s walls.

“Boom!” As Luo Tian punched Tu Feiyang, his body collided with the wall, and the hall could no longer endure—it collapsed into ruins floating before Luo Tian and his companions.

As the hall crumbled, they noticed their surroundings had changed to starry space.

“What’s going on? Have we escaped the demon realm?” Fuxingyue halted, standing beside Luo Tian. He watched the hall’s debris fall into space.

“Look there!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered, gazing at a black continent in the stars.

“Boom, boom, boom…” The black continent trembled constantly, dark qi surging from it. From afar, it resembled a heart, radiating immense pressure.

“World’s Heart!” Fuxingyue gasped, staring at the black continent.

“My sword I’ve given you—don’t fight me for this land!” Tu Feiyang leapt into the air, rushing toward the black continent.

“You think too much! We came here for this!” Luo Tian soared after Tu Feiyang, willing to part with the Mortal Darkness Sword but not the World’s Heart.

“Familiar or not, this World’s Heart doesn’t belong to you!” Fuxingyue sneered, transforming into a streak of light and charging toward the black continent.

Their speed was blinding; they arrived at the continent’s edge, cautious gazes fixed on it. Tu Feiyang spat out a torrent of blood qi, directing it toward the heart-shaped land.

“Boom!” Yet as Tu Feiyang’s blood qi surged, the continent emitted dark qi, countering with overwhelming demonic energy. The blood dragon was devoured without a trace, halting Luo Tian’s group.

“This dense demonic energy is unrefinable!” Fuxingyue frowned, addressing Luo Tian.

“There might be a way,” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, recalling a technique from Jinghang’s inheritance.

“Try it; I’ll guard you!” Fuxingyue whispered, casting a wary glance at Tu Feiyang.

“Alright!” Luo Tian nodded, leaping toward the black continent. Tu Feiyang still clung to hope, desperately inhaling blood qi to refine the World’s Heart.

“Boom…” Luo Tian circled with demonic energy, sitting upon the continent.

“Daoxin Zhenmo!” Luo Tian’s hands moved swiftly, black script dragons emerging from his palms. They roared toward the World’s Heart.

“Hua Mo!” Luo Tian spat blood, and a black script dragon soared forth, absorbing the World’s Heart’s demonic qi.

“He has become a demon cultivator!” Fuxingyue’s eyes flickered, watching Luo Tian seated atop the demonic qi-infused World’s Heart.

“Hum…” As Fuxingyue marveled, several figures appeared beneath the starry sky—each battered.

“Found it! The World’s Heart!” The first to arrive was Jiang Yuwen, who spotted the black World’s Heart with excitement.

“Senior Three, hand over what you’ve acquired!” As Jiang Yuwen appeared, shouts echoed through the stars, making his face pale.

Jiang Yulong, Jiang Yufeng, and Jiang Yutian appeared in the starry sky. Four half-step Xianwang elders also emerged, and Fu Xingyang joined Fuxingyue.

“Tu Feiyang?” Fu Xingyang spotted the blood-cloaked Tu Feiyang, his eyes flashing surprise.

“What did you say?” As Fu Xingyang stood before Fuxingyue, Jiang Yuwen was attacked by Jiang Yulong, Jiang Yufeng, and Jiang Yutian.

Chapter 2283: Refining ()

On the black World’s Heart, Luo Tian sat, his black demonic qi dragons growing continuously, absorbing the heart’s澎湃 demonic energy. If one could see these dragons’ trajectories, they would recognize them gradually encircling the entire World’s Heart.

“Damn it! I had no chance… this was meant to be mine!” Tu Feiyang lamented, watching Luo Tian unaffected by the demonic qi.

Tu Feiyang had arrived here some time ago, like Fuxingyue and Fu Xingyang. After the Immortal Road collapsed, they entered this realm—though Tu Feiyang was luckier, directly transported to the demon realm, the ruins of Tianmo Sect.

Tu Feiyang had seized all resources from the Tianmo Sect, ascending to half-step Xianwang. Two years ago, he entered the hall housing the Mortal Darkness Sword, refining it—only to be outmaneuvered by Luo Tian.

If Luo Tian’s group hadn’t arrived, Tu Feiyang was confident he would have claimed the sword and, with time, the World’s Heart. He felt it was a treasure; he had even heard its heartbeat before.

“Boom!” Meanwhile, Jiang Yulong, Jiang Yufeng, and Jiang Yutian relentlessly attacked Jiang Yuwen, forcing him to retreat, blood spewing from his mouth.

Jiang Dao wished to aid Jiang Yuwen but was watched closely by three half-step Xianwang elders, unable to act.

“What’s going on? Why are they attacking Third Prince?” Jiang Dao asked, confusion in his eyes.

“Did you take all the resources from Tianmo Sect?”

“Hurry and hand them over, or Third Prince won’t survive!” One elder roared, anger in his voice.

“Rubbish! I arrived late and found no resources—where would I get them for you!” Jiang Yuwen roared, blood spewing as he realized why they attacked him.

“Don’t lie! Hurry and hand them over, or you won’t survive!” Jiang Yulong swung his staff, striking Jiang Yuwen’s leg. Jiang Yuwen grimaced but raised his hands to meet the others’ attacks.

“These three clearly fear Jiang Yuwen will seize the World’s Heart. Among them, this one preserved his strength best!” Fuxingyue and Fu Xingyang exchanged glances, watching the four half-step Xianwang elders. They knew these men would attack them after defeating Jiang Yuwen, then fight for the World’s Heart.

“Have Jiang Yuzhe and others been eliminated? Why haven’t they emerged yet?” Fu Xingyang furrowed his brows. They were definitely no match for the four elders.

“Tu Feiyang, stop thinking—this isn’t something we can claim!” Fuxingyue addressed Tu Feiyang.

“Damn it!” Tu Feiyang felt defeated, standing in the starry sky with intense anger.

“Pf!” As they spoke, Jiang Yuwen spat blood and fell from the starry sky.

“Master!” Jiang Dao’s face darkened, leaping toward Jiang Yuwen. The three half-step Xianwang elders did not stop him.

“Now it’s our turn!” Fuxingyue and Fu Xingyang exchanged glances, watching Jiang Yulong’s group approach.

“Get out! This isn’t your place!” One elder barked, gazing at Fuxingyue and Fu Xingyang.

“This path is blocked!” Fuxingyue sneered, swinging his spear at the elder. He knew only defeating them would work.

“Just you two? Think you can block us?” Three elders sneered, wielding weapons as they attacked Fuxingyue and Fu Xingyang.

Three against two, the elders quickly subdued them, inflicting wounds.

Meanwhile, Jiang Yulong, Jiang Yufeng, and Jiang Yutian stood before the black World’s Heart, excitement in their eyes.

“Luo Tian, move aside! This World’s Heart was prepared by my father for us—you have no right to touch it!” Jiang Yulong roared, gazing at Luo Tian seated atop the World’s Heart with swirling demonic qi.

“Roar!” Luo Tian opened his eyes, pointing a finger. Three black dragon spirits broke free from the World’s Heart, charging toward them.

“Die!” Jiang Yulong cursed, swinging his staff to clash with one dragon spirit.

“Lowly locals dare oppose the Bu Tian Sect? You’re trash, despicable trash!” One elder sneered, slashing his blade.

“Indeed! If Bu Tian Xianwang hadn’t been merciful, you wouldn’t be alive now!” Another elder added.

“F***! Who are you calling trash? Who’s despicable? Your whole family is trash!” As the words fell, a streak of blood light surged toward the elder. A blood dagger pierced his back.

“Pf!” Blood erupted from the elder’s shoulder, his face pale with disbelief.

“You…?” The elder saw the blood figure approaching and retreated.

“Thanks, Tu Feiyang!” Fuxingyue and Fu Xingyang sighed, shouting at Tu Feiyang.

“Don’t thank me—I just couldn’t stand these three bastards!” Tu Feiyang stood in the void, his body like a blood lightning bolt, rushing toward the elder with two blood daggers. His strikes were relentless, leaving the elder no chance to resist. Though Fuxingyue and Fu Xingyang, along with Luo Tian, were beneath Tu Feiyang’s respect, they were all Nine Domains disciples. Fuxingyue and Fu Xingyang were also descendants of the Ancient Kings; Tu Feiyang could not allow them to be insulted.

The stars exploded, and the elder was battered repeatedly, blood spewing. Tu Feiyang’s aura soared, and Fuxingyue and Fu Xingyang felt less pressure. The situation briefly balanced.

Luo Tian sat atop the World’s Heart, watching the balance, exhaling relief as he summoned demonic qi dragons to block Jiang Yulong, Jiang Yufeng, and Jiang Yutian.

Time passed slowly; the elder fighting Tu Feiyang finally succumbed, pierced in the heart by a dagger. His body fell, becoming a corpse drifting into space.

“Who knew he became so strong?” Fuxingyue and Fu Xingyang were astonished, watching Tu Feiyang standing amidst blood.

“Come on! Fight back!” Tu Feiyang roared, his voice mighty, shaking the cosmos. He stood there, eyes cold.

“Hum…” As Tu Feiyang’s words ended, two more waves appeared in the stars. Two battered figures emerged—also half-step Xianwangs.

They were Jiang Yuhong and Jiang Yuqian, brought by Jiang Yulong and Jiang Yufeng. Upon arrival, they observed the situation, their eyes thoughtful.

“Two of you—Jiang Yuhong and Jiang Yuqian have been eliminated. Help us defeat these locals, then fight for the World’s Heart! We’ll reward you accordingly!” Jiang Yulong addressed them. The greatest obstacle was Fuxingyue, Fu Xingyang, and Tu Feiyang. If they eliminated them, Luo Tian alone would be no match.

“Good!” They considered it, then leapt toward Tu Feiyang.

“Can’t fight!” Tu Feiyang immediately backed down, losing his previous boldness. Two half-step Xianwangs—his chances of defeating them were uncertain.

“Boom, boom, boom…” Three black dragon spirits exploded, scattering into a surge of demonic qi before Jiang Yulong’s group.

“First deal with this kid!” Jiang Yulong sneered, holding a token that formed a barrier around him. He rushed toward the World’s Heart—this token was the Bu Tian Token.

Only Jiang Yuzhe and his brothers knew that possessing the Bu Tian Token allowed one to refine the World’s Heart. This was revealed by Bu Tian Xianwang.

“Get out…” As the three held the token and rushed toward Luo Tian, he opened his eyes again. His voice rang out like thunder in their ears.

“Hum…” Invisible pressure radiated from Luo Tian, causing the World’s Heart to tremble. The entire world seemed to resonate with his voice.

“He has refined the World’s Heart—no, not fully yet!” Jiang Yulong and others grimaced, watching Luo Tian still seated. Though he sat there, his aura was oppressive, preventing them from approaching.

“Damn it! Luo Tian, Jiang Yuzhe has been eliminated—why do you still vie for the World’s Heart!” Jiang Yulong roared, anger in his voice. This World’s Heart was meant for them by their father, yet Luo Tian had stolen it.

“Hum…” A black demon seed materialized before Luo Tian, radiating a faint divine light. A smile flickered on his face. As the seed formed, the World’s Heart’s demonic qi lessened slightly.

Chapter 2284: Acquisition ()

The black demon seed landed before Luo Tian, causing him to smile. He collected the seed, sensing its demonic qi was terrifying—any demon cultivator would gain a significant boost.

Luo Tian had just reached the peak of True Immortal; refining to half-step Xianwang would be risky. Thus, he decided to keep the seed for later absorption. The immediate priority was mastering the World’s Heart—once done, this test by Bu Tian Xianwang’s sons would end.

In the past period, Luo Tian had refined two-tenths of the World’s Heart and could now wield two-tenths of its power. This was the World’s Heart’s terrifying nature—had an Xianwang been here, he could have refined eight-tenths and surpassed even the Xianwang. In this world, mastering the World’s Heart meant dominance.

Two-tenths of its power was enough for Luo Tian, which he channeled to empower Fuxingyue and Fu Xingyang. Their enhanced aura made Jiang Yulong, Jiang Yuzhe, and others halt their steps, too afraid to advance.

“Boom!” As the World’s Power was channeled, Fuxingyue and Fu Xingyang surged with might. They fought three against two without falling behind, while Tu Feiyang began subduing the remaining elder.

“Luo Tian, you owe me a favor—no, two, three… I hate you!” Tu Feiyang roared, his voice filled with resentment.

The situation balanced again as Luo Tian began refining the World’s Heart. Black script dragons grew continuously, and the World’s Heart shrank at a slow pace.

“One… two…” Black demon seeds gathered around Luo Tian, each radiating immense aura.

“Three-tenths! Damn it!” Jiang Yulong and others grimaced, watching Luo Tian seated. They felt their power growing stronger, nearing their limit.

“Hum…” As they pondered, a figure returned from the starry sky—Jiang Daofa, who had gone to find Jiang Yuwen’s corpse.

“Jiang Daofa! Help us defeat this kid!” Jiang Yulong and others saw him, their faces lighting up. They shouted at Jiang Daofa.

Jiang Daofa furrowed his brows, watching Jiang Yulong’s group before leaping into the air. If he could obtain the World’s Heart, it would be the same for Jiang Yuwen. But if Luo Tian continued refining it, they would all be defeated.

Jiang Daofa soared into the air, his body a streak of golden lightning. He sensed the formidable pressure and grew serious.

“Go!” As Jiang Daofa was tense, Luo Tian moved. He extended a hand, summoning three black script dragons that struck toward Jiang Daofa.

“Hum…” The thick black script dragon shattered the void, appearing before Jiang Daofa. His face darkened.

“Open!” Jiang Daofa roared, punching the black dragon. It collided with his fist.

“Boom!” The black dragon was shattered, but three in total—two more struck Jiang Daofa’s body.

“Do you think you’re still my opponent?” Luo Tian sneered, watching Jiang Daofa. With the World’s Heart’s power, he was confident in defeating a half-step Xianwang.

Jiang Daofa spat blood, his body flying back. He gazed at Luo Tian atop the World’s Heart and shouted to Jiang Yulong: “Three Princes, you have survival techniques. I’m no match for him—use them now or never!”

“Use it!” Hearing Jiang Daofa’s words, Jiang Yulong and others’ faces lit with madness. They unleashed their final techniques.

“Hum…” Jiang Yulong extended a hand, a golden light rising. A divine aura of Xianwang initial stage emerged from his palm.

In an instant, a golden seal flew from Jiang Yulong’s hand, radiating overwhelming power. It collapsed the stars, rushing toward Luo Tian. Jiang Yufeng and Jiang Yutian also unleashed their techniques—golden towers and gray gates, each radiating terrifying power. These were their final attacks; they had used many in the death trap, leaving only this last strike.

“Three Xianwang initial stage attacks—what will you do?” Jiang Yulong sneered, roaring as the golden seal descended.

“Three Xianwang initial stage attacks? Who hasn’t faced them?” Luo Tian sneered, his dantian roaring. A black sword qi shot from his hand.

The poison sword aura left by Du Jianhang, the Poison Sword Heaven尊 in Luo Tian’s body, was now fully unleashed. One single sword qi alone could make the stars pale. Who was Poison Sword Heaven尊? The top of the Eight Heaven尊 in the Hell’s Wheel Rotation, attack first. A Xianwang mid-stage could withstand three Xianwang initial stage attacks.

Destructive and annihilating energy erupted from Luo Tian’s hand, the black sword qi making Jiang Yulong and others tremble. Even Jiang Daofa and other half-step Xianwangs felt intense danger—this black sword qi could obliterate them.

Boom, boom, boom… The attacks from Jiang Yulong and others were instantly severed by the sword qi. The overwhelming power spread outward, making the stars still. Only stormy winds swept in all directions.

“Another one! Finish it!” Luo Tian laughed, having used his secret weapon. Previously, in the death trap, he had wanted to counter Jinghang’s attack with Du Jianhang’s sword qi. But Jinghang’s strike was too strong, leaving Luo Tian feeling it surpassed Du Jianhang’s qi.

Boom… A black mountain surged forth, crushing the three half-step Xianwang fighting Fuxingyue and Fu Xingyang.

“Damn it, why didn’t you use this earlier!” Fuxingyue and Fu Xingyang flew back, standing before the World’s Heart.

Divine light flickered; cold energy flowed again as a black knife qi shot from Luo Tian’s hand, striking the elder fighting Tu Feiyang. Two attacks—each at Xianwang initial stage—plus the World’s Power加持 made them capable of defeating half-step Xianwang.

“Damn it… how many more do you have?” Everyone was stunned, watching Luo Tian’s two attacks. They hadn’t expected him to possess Xianwang-level power.

Boom… The thunderous explosions annihilated the stars, spreading outward like an apocalypse. Tu Feiyang, Fuxingyue, and others stared in awe at Luo Tian.

“Four-tenths!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with a hint of joy, resuming his meditation to refine the World’s Heart.

No one dared stop him now; Jiang Yulong and others could not approach, while the half-step Xianwangs were severely wounded.

“Five-tenths… six-tenths…” Time passed, and no one stopped him. Luo Tian’s speed increased, black demon seeds rapidly gathering before him. Fuxingyue and others felt the World’s Heart fading.

“Nine-tenths… ten-tenths…” Finally, as the last black script dragon transformed into a demon seed, the World’s Heart lost all its dark qi. It radiated fierce power and shrank into Luo Tian’s hands.

“Powerful!” Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with joy. He could now kill anyone in this star domain without effort.

“Luo Tian, sell me the World’s Heart—I’ll give you enough compensation!” Jiang Yulong shouted, gazing at Luo Tian.

“I’ll double it!” Jiang Yufeng also shouted, her voice tense. Now that the World’s Heart was refined by Luo Tian, Bu Tian Xianwang wouldn’t let it stay with him. If they bought it, there was still a chance—strongarm wasn’t possible.

“Not selling!” Luo Tian shook his head gently, a smile on his face. He extended a hand, pouring divine energy into Fuxingyue, Fu Xingyang, and Tu Feiyang. Their strength instantly returned to peak levels.

“Amazing!” Fuxingyue and Fu Xingyang’s faces lit up, gazing at the World’s Heart. With it, they would be masters of this star domain—destroy anyone with a single thought.
