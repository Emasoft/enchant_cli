But Luo Tian saw this fish-like head had two horns and dragon whiskers.

Luo Tian gently touched the water dragon's corpse, which was as tall as a mountain. A cold chill seeped into Luo Tian's body, causing his mid-Nascent Soul physique to shudder.

"Keep it. I've extracted the dragon sinews for you and forged a bow. Your mother is renowned as an artificer! As for the corpse, you handle it yourself—after all, these are precious treasures. It's no easy feat to find such a massive beast now!" Zhang Qiuyue said with an appreciative expression, secretly grateful for her luck.

Before Luo Tian could speak, Zhang Qiuyue waved her hand again, and a pale blue longbow materialized in her grasp. Its golden string and pale blue frame gleamed.

"This bow should be Earth-grade mid-tier. Compared to high-tier Earth-grade, it only lacks an artifact soul. Unfortunately, this demon dragon was too stubborn; knowing its fate, it burned its spirit to fight back. Come on, son—drip your blood onto it. Oh, and I also have an Earth-grade low-tier inner armor..." Zhang Qiuyue listed each item she pulled from her storage ring, tossing them onto Luo Tian's front like garbage.

Luo Tian stared in awe. Though he believed himself well-stocked with treasures, the items his mother tossed out—each at least a high-tier Xuan-grade—made him feel like a pauper.

"Take them all! These are treasures my mother casually forged while in the Ice Extreme Island!" Luo Nantian smiled, watching Zhang Qiuyue still rummaging through things.

"Still staring? Think these are too inferior? Indeed, they're not top-tier. Wait until you go to the Ice Extreme Island; I'll give you better ones!" Zhang Qiuyue frowned, watching Luo Tian's dazed expression as she began tidying up the ground.

"Good! Excellent! No need, mother—everything's fine!" Luo Tian felt warmth in his heart. He waved his hand, enveloping the mountain of treasures and the water dragon's corpse in a storage ring.

Seeing Luo Tian collect everything, Zhang Qiuyue smiled: "You're such a straightforward child. When you travel outside, remember not to be taken advantage of; if you can't fight, run!"

After advising Luo Tian, she turned to Luo Nantian with a look that said "It's your turn."

"Uh..." Luo Nantian blushed at Zhang Qiuyue's gaze. He was merely a spiritual body, so he couldn't carry anything—his face naturally turned awkward.

Luo Tian also gazed at his father, showing respect.

At Luo Tian's gaze, Luo Nantian's face reddened. He then wore a serious expression: "Son, as cultivators, we shouldn't rely on external tools. Our own strength is most important!"

Hearing Luo Nantian's words, Luo Tian dared not disobey, his face showing respect: "Son shall heed father's teachings!"

"Don't listen to your father's nonsense. Listen to me—when someone bullies us, we fight back! Now that you've reached Nascent Soul, don't忍耐 anymore. Your parents are your greatest support; if you can't fight, run and tell me—I'll annihilate their clan. I dare to see who dares trouble my Zhang Qiuyue's son!" Zhang Qiuyue snorted.

"Uh..." Luo Tian looked stunned, then sighed inwardly—this was the feeling of having parents to protect you. He'd longed for this moment.

"One life, a thousand years. This is your ninth reincarnation. Father and I still have centuries before we can leave the Ice Extreme Island, so be careful!" Luo Nantian spoke softly, his gaze finally softening.

"Alright, father and mother must go. Prolonged stay might cause changes in the Ice Extreme Island. Remember, after finishing all matters, go to the Southern Region's Ice Extreme Island. I hope you can avenge our clan!" Luo Nantian's face showed reluctance.

Hearing Luo Nantian's words, Zhang Qiuyue's eyes filled with tears again. She approached Luo Tian and gave further instructions.

Luo Tian knelt on the ground, bowing three deep prostrations to Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiuyue. His eyes also held reluctance as he watched his parents leave.

"Son, remember—choose any girl you like and marry her! Don't be timid; if necessary, just seize her!" Zhang Qiuyue's voice echoed in the sky. A spatial rift formed before them, and with reluctance, the couple stepped into the void.

"I now have parents!" Luo Tian's eyes moistened, his fists clenching. He gazed toward the Southern Region with a solemn expression.

"The Southern Region, Ice Extreme Island—I'll go!" Luo Tian's face bore a cold expression. His mind involuntarily conjured the image of a thirteen-year-old girl.

Chapter 470: Forging the Body ()

Chapter 470: Forging the Body

In Beichang County's Beiming City, Huang Family's courtyard.

Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin looked worried, gazing at Beiming City's outskirts. Black Tiger Brothers had received orders from the Dragon Emperor and rushed to Yuling Sect with Long Bao, intending to use Yuling Sect's transmission array to return to Beiyu's Great Forest.

After all, Long Bao hadn't seen Dragon Sword Couple since emerging, and they missed him deeply.

Zhang Ziping remained behind, planning to assist Luo Tian in handling Eastern Region matters before returning to Beiyu with him.

The Five City Guardians headed to Dongzhiyong's post—Dongzhiyong had committed a grave offense by leaving私自.

"Senior Zhang, do you think Luo Tian might be in danger?" Leng Qiuchan asked Zhang Ziping with some unease.

Zhang Ziping looked at Leng Qiuchan, smiling inwardly at his little brother's good fortune with women.

"Rest assured; the two elders Black Tiger said those middle-aged couple had no ill intent toward Luo Tian, right?" Zhang Ziping smiled, but his eyes also showed concern.

"Rest assured, Qiuchan sister, Luo Tian's fate is great—this man survived even a storm! Let me tell you..." Zheng Xin approached Leng Qiuchan with flattery.

"Yes, Qiuchan, I didn't expect you to change so much—just one man has you preoccupied!" Duan Yuyan's voice echoed from Zheng Xin's jade pendant.

"Yanghun Jade!" Zhang Ziping's eyes darkened, snatching Zheng Xin's jade pendant. His face bore anger.

"Did Luo Tian give this to you?" Zhang Ziping's voice turned cold, his gaze interrogating Zheng Xin.

"Uh..." Zheng Xin froze at Zhang Ziping's question, unsure how to respond.

"It was just temporarily borrowed; once Yu Yan finds a body, I'll return it!" Luo Tian's voice echoed in their ears.

"Luo Tian!"

"Master, Master, Grandmaster!" People's eyes lit up with surprise as Luo Tian approached from afar.

Luo Tian smiled, greeting everyone. Under their reverent gazes, he approached Zhang Ziping.

"Rash! Remember to always carry this jade pendant; it's..." Zhang Ziping's face was solemn, then he closed his mouth without finishing.

"This is your master's gift—don't give it to anyone casually!" Zhang Ziping explained after seeing Luo Tian's questioning gaze.

Hearing Zhang Ziping's evasive explanation, Luo Tian took the jade pendant, his mind puzzled but not overthinking—after all, his senior wouldn't harm him.

"Unfortunately, Yang Huanyu escaped again; Yu Yan's body can't be forged!" Luo Tian looked disappointed, speaking to the jade pendant.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Zheng Xin and Leng Qiuchan smiled at him.

"Huh?" Luo Tian felt strange at their smiles.

"Here..." Leng Qiuchan smiled, tossing a crimson sphere into Luo Tian's hands.

At the moment Luo Tian received it, a torrent of blood energy surged into his mind.

"This is the Blood Emperor!" Luo Tian's face lit up with joy, looking at Leng Qiuchan and others in surprise.

"Yes, I suppose this Blood Emperor's blood energy should be enough for you!" Zheng Xin approached, patting Luo Tian's shoulder with a smug expression.

Zheng Xin had already noticed Yang Huanyu's escape; since Yang Huanyu's escape meant no soul-forging pearl, Yu Yan would have to find a wicked woman for possession. This was unacceptable to Zheng Xin, so he secretly targeted the Blood Emperor, using his persuasive skills to obtain the blood pearl from Long Bao.

Luo Tian nodded, impressed by Zheng Xin's eloquence. He knew how fiercely Long Bao protected his "toys," even he had to persuade for small items. How much more so for Zheng Xin?

"Enough! The Blood Emperor's blood energy is naturally sufficient. Now, prepare the materials for forging Yu Yan's body. I have all the materials; after resting two days and adjusting my state, I'll forge her body." Luo Tian spoke.

"Xi xi... Thank you, Luo Tian!" Duan Yu Yan's lively voice echoed in their ears.

For the next two days, Luo Tian handled matters in Beichang County. Now, Huang Family dominated Beiming City, while Wu Di became a city guardian, guarding the previous Dongzhiyong's pass.

Though Wu Di was merely at the late Bone-Formation stage, with Luo Tian as a pillar and Ding Hongfei's help, Wu Di managed to hold his ground. As for the aftereffects of taking the Explosive Spirit Pill, it was no challenge for Luo Tian—after all, he had crafted the pill himself and knew its solution.

As for the Qi Family father and son, Luo Tian was conflicted. He liked Qi Tianba's personality but now they were enemies. In the end, it was Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin who decided to eradicate them completely.

Three days passed quickly. Luo Tian sat in a small courtyard, Leng Qiuchan beside him. They both opened their eyes simultaneously, emitting a faint aura. They exchanged smiles and entered the separate room Huang Family had prepared for them. Zheng Xin stood outside, his face showing concern as he guarded them.

"You prepare first; I'll call you when it's your turn!" Luo Tian smiled, his gaze serious.

The reason for calling Leng Qiuchan was because forging a woman's body had some steps that were inconvenient for Luo Tian.

"Okay!" Leng Qiuchan nodded gently, standing before Luo Tian.

"Breathe..." Seeing Leng Qiuchan ready, Luo Tian took a deep breath and summoned the Soul-Subduing Cauldron. A pale flame leaped from his hand, entering the cauldron's fire hole.

"Shu... Shu..." Luo Tian smiled, inwardly marveling at how long it had been since he last forged pills. Now, his techniques felt a bit rusty.

Shadows of movements formed before Luo Tian, astonishing Duan Yu Yan who had just emerged from the Yanghun Jade.

"Qiuchan, I didn't know your man was also a high-level alchemist! His techniques rival those of the old-timers in our Dangzong!" Duan Yu Yan praised, watching Luo Tian place all materials into the Soul-Subduing Cauldron.

Leng Qiuchan's gaze showed surprise; he had long known Luo Tian wasn't a simple alchemist, but few could earn such high praise from Duan Yu Yan of the Dangzong.

Fifth chapter

Chapter 471: Fusing Three Thousand Blazing Flame Fire ()

Chapter 471: Fusing Three Thousand Blazing Flame Fire

In Huang Family's courtyard in Beichang County, Zheng Xin anxiously watched the small house constantly emitting thunderous sounds. His face showed anticipation.

It had been three days since Luo Tian, Leng Qiuchan, and Duan Yu Yan entered the small house. Three days had felt like an eternity to Zheng Xin, and the continuous thunderous sounds from within made him restless.

Inside the house, Luo Tian wore a serious expression. His Nascent Soul peak-level spiritual sense fully extended, fusing the medicinal liquid and metal materials within the Soul-Subduing Cauldron.

His powerful spiritual sense permeated every cell, and Luo Tian dared not be careless—any mistake would be fatal for Duan Yu Yan.

Sweat dripped from Luo Tian's face, making Leng Qiuchan worry.

"Give me focus..." Luo Tian roared, and the cauldron's lid flew open under his spiritual sense.

"嗡..." A strong fluctuation formed in the small house.

Under Leng Qiuchan and Duan Yu Yan's gaze, a humanoid body emerged from the Soul-Subduing Cauldron and lay on the prepared table under Luo Tian's control.

"Qiuchan, it's your turn now; I'll go out first!" Luo Tian smiled, nodding to Leng Qiuchan.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Leng Qiuchan nodded and approached the humanoid body, his gaze showing oddity.

Luo Tian's face showed embarrassment as he stepped out of the door.

"Luo Tian!" Seeing Luo Tian exit, Zheng Xin's face lit up with joy.

"Rest easy; everything is still going smoothly!" Luo Tian gave Zheng Xin a reassuring glance before sitting cross-legged, activating the "Soul-Reviving and Spirit-Stealing" technique and the "Five Elements Transmutation Art" to recover his depleted spiritual energy and spiritual sense.

Hearing Luo Tian's confirmation, Zheng Xin finally relaxed. Seeing Luo Tian recovering, he had no more chatter, knowing this was crucial and couldn't be careless.

But soon, Zheng Xin's mouth twitched as he heard Duan Yu Yan's silver-like laughter from inside.

"Qiuchan... don't move that! It's ticklish... make it bigger... yes... and the butt, isn't a big butt supposed to produce sons?" Duan Yu Yan's lively voice echoed into Luo Tian and Zheng Xin's ears.

Luo Tian's face bore a苦笑, opening his eyes to see Zheng Xin standing there red-faced.

They exchanged glances and both smiled, but who could concentrate on recovery in such a situation?

Luo Tian sighed, having no choice but to take out two pills—one for spiritual sense recovery and one for energy—swallowing them.

Under Duan Yu Yan's continuous giggles, Luo Tian and Zheng Xin endured outside for an hour until a sweat-drenched Leng Qiuchan emerged.

"Done!" Leng Qiuchan took a deep breath, obviously exhausted and even pale-faced.

"Hard work!" Luo Tian and Zheng Xin entered the small room.

Seeing Duan Yu Yan wearing a green robe, lying on the bed but with stiff movements, they were surprised.

"Luo Tian, hurry and fix my meridians! This position is too uncomfortable!" Duan Yu Yan shouted upon seeing Luo Tian and Zheng Xin.

"Okay!" Luo Tian nodded without further words, approaching Duan Yu Yan and taking out the blood pearl condensed from the Blood Emperor's blood energy.

"Endure it; it might hurt a bit!" Luo Tian spoke softly, signaling Duan Yu Yan to prepare.

Before Duan Yu Yan could respond, Luo Tian placed the blood pearl in his hand and unleashed spiritual energy to strike it.

"Crack..." Under Luo Tian's full power, the blood pearl emitted a crisp sound and shattered.

"Boom..." As if exploding, the overwhelming blood energy filled the small room.

"Retrieve it..." Luo Tian waved his hand, pulling back the blood energy. The energy seemed to be pulled back by something and floated on his palm.

Seeing the blood energy returned, Luo Tian pressed his hand against Duan Yu Yan's head, instantly flooding his spiritual sense into the body he had just forged.

Within his spiritual sense, Luo Tian felt Duan Yu Yan's body was chaotic. He knew what he needed to do next: reconstruct her meridians and fully transform her into a normal person.

"One... two... ten..."

His vast spiritual sense transformed into a needle,穿梭 through Duan Yu Yan's body. Each needle was followed by the Blood Emperor's blood energy.

Time passed slowly, and sweat accumulated on Luo Tian's forehead. Under his spiritual sense guiding the Blood Emperor's blood energy, Duan Yu Yan's complex meridians gradually improved.

An hour—this hour felt like an entire century to Luo Tian.

"Breath..."

"It's done!" Luo Tian's face lit up with joy, his spiritual sense confirming Duan Yu Yan's meridians were fully perfected. The blood energy slowly generated and flowed through the newly formed meridians.

"Done?" Zheng Xin and Leng Qiuchan smiled upon hearing Luo Tian's words.

"One more step!" Luo Tian smiled, opening the Soul-Subduing Cauldron's lid again. A scorching heat filled the small room.

Three Thousand Blazing Flame Fire, now weakened to its limit under the Soul-Subduing Cauldron's suppression, purple flames flickered and approached Luo Tian's hand.

"Luo Tian!" Seeing Luo Tian retrieving the fire that almost killed Duan Yu Yan, Zheng Xin's face showed alarm.

"Rest easy; it has no more arrogance now!" Luo Tian smiled, speaking softly.

"Yu Yan, I'll now infuse the Three Thousand Blazing Flame Fire into your body. Cultivate it and use it to refine your body—your strength will greatly improve!" Luo Tian smiled, watching Duan Yu Yan sit cross-legged.

"Luotian, this Blazing Flame Fire is yours! It will greatly enhance your strength..." Duan Yu Yan tried to refuse, feeling she had already received too much help. She was satisfied just being alive.

But Luo Tian ignored her, approaching Duan Yu Yan's back and striking it with the Blazing Flame Fire.

"You!" Duan Yu Yan was about to speak but felt a fiery sensation in her newly repaired meridians, as if they would be burned again.

Duan Yu Yan dared not be careless; the Three Thousand Blazing Flame Fire was notorious. She quickly activated her cultivation technique, fully focusing on cultivating it.

Chapter 472: Duan Yu Yan's Demon Trial ()

Chapter 472: Duan Yu Yan's Demon Trial

Seeing Duan Yu Yan close her eyes to cultivate, Luo Tian led Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin out of the house. He instructed Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin to guard Duan Yu Yan, while he went to Zhang Ziping's residence under the gaze of reverence.

Now, Luo Tian was a god-like figure in Huang Family's eyes—whether it was Huang Tianshu's respect or Luo Tian's own strength, he had absolute authority in Huang Family.

"Senior Brother!" Luo Tian showed respect, as Zhang Ziping had arrived in Beichang County but they hadn't spoken properly. Luo Tian also wanted to know the current situation in Beiyu.

"Done?" Zhang Ziping asked, his face calm.

"Yes, now we can directly go to Yuling Sect and say goodbye before returning to Beiyu!" Luo Tian stretched, feeling exhausted from his time in the Eastern Region.

Zhang Ziping nodded slightly and continued: "I must go first; there are some matters in the Dangzong. I believe your death has already caused a stir in Beiyu!"

Zhang Ziping smiled, recalling the commotion Luo Tian's death caused in Beiyu. He wanted to see the expressions of those sect geniuses upon seeing Luo Tian return.

"Also, the Xianggu Ruins are about to open. This time, do you want to represent Wuxing Sect or Yuling Sect?" Zhang Ziping continued.

"Wuxing Sect!" Luo Tian thought for a moment, recalling that currently, no one else in Wuxing Sect could match him.

"Good, with your second and third senior brothers watching over you, I'll feel more at ease!" Zhang Ziping spoke.

Hearing Zhang Ziping's words, Luo Tian smiled, missing his two senior brothers after so long.

"Remember, the token your master gave you must always be on your person, especially in the Xianggu Ruins. Be careful there; that's where geniuses gather—four regions' talents will go there to seek an opportunity!" Zhang Ziping warned again.

"Geniuses gathering?" Luo Tian's eyes sparkled, his face showing battle intent.

"What are geniuses? They're just obstacles for me Luo Tian! Whoever provokes me, I'll crush them!" Luo Tian whispered, his eyes burning with eagerness.

After a long conversation, night fell, and Luo Tian left Zhang Ziping's residence, returning to the previous small house.

As soon as he entered the courtyard, Luo Tian felt a wave of heat. Leng Qiuchan sat on a green stone, while Zheng Xin circled her, constantly talking, making Leng Qiuchan's brows furrow.

"Qiuchan... do you think Yu Yan will be okay? Will she advance to Nascent Soul after cultivating the Three Thousand Blazing Flame Fire... Qiuchan..." The voice, like a fly, entered Luo Tian's ears.

"Cough cough..." Luo Tian lightly coughed, drawing Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin's attention.

"Luo Tian, you're back! Do you think Yu Yan will..." Luo Tian shoved a toxic pill into Zheng Xin's mouth and sat cross-legged beside Leng Qiuchan.

Zheng Xin circled them, like a fly, but couldn't speak.

Six days passed...

That morning, thunderous sounds continuously echoed from the small house. A violent aura made Luo Tian and the others open their eyes, their faces showing joy.

"Success!" Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at the small house.

"Creak..." Under their expectant gazes, Duan Yu Yan's figure slowly stepped out of the small house. Then she looked anxious.

"Quickly take me to a secluded place; I need to undergo the demon trial!" Duan Yu Yan's voice carried urgency, addressing Luo Tian and Zheng Xin.

"Demon trial!" Duan Yu Yan's words made the three of them shocked, gazing at the sky where clouds were gathering.

Luo Tian didn't delay, shouting: "Follow me!"

After saying that, he disregarded propriety and grabbed Leng Qiuchan with one hand and Duan Yu Yan with the other. His seven-colored wings spread, flying toward a distant place.

"Damn..." Zheng Xin wanted to curse but couldn't speak. Wind sounded beneath him, and he chased upward.

Luo Tian flew, having just passed the third Nascent Soul trial, naturally knowing the power of these three trials. If Duan Yu Yan underwent the demon trial in Beiming City, not only would Beiming City be ruined but Duan Yu Yan would also suffer.

"Shu..." A sound of breaking through the air, Luo Tian appeared on a spacious ground. He placed Duan Yu Yan and Leng Qiuchan down.

As soon as they landed, dark clouds followed immediately, startling Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan. Luo Tian grabbed Leng Qiuchan again and vanished from the spot.

"Luo Tian! You... why didn't you take me!" Zheng Xin panted, his gaze showing tension at the gathered thunderclouds.

"It's starting!" Luo Tian whispered, frowning at the thunderclouds above.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian's words ended, a deafening thunder rumbled in the sky. This sound was familiar to Luo Tian—Thunder Trial.

"Crack..." The dark sky suddenly lit up, a thick lightning bolt fell.

"Haha!" Duan Yu Yan smiled playfully, flicking her finger and releasing a red flame that engulfed the blue lightning.

In awe, Luo Tian and Zheng Xin watched as the weak flame instantly burned the thunder trial. The terrifying temperature melted even the lightning.

"Ah..." A gasp of admiration echoed from Luo Tian's group.

"This Three Thousand Blazing Flame Fire is so powerful! It can even burn through thunder trials!" Luo Tian was stunned.

"Yes, I heard the Dangzong's three ancestral flames can destroy everything after being fully refined!" Leng Qiuchan spoke, his gaze also showing admiration.

As they spoke, the second thunder trial fell, and Duan Yu Yan effortlessly dodged it without a single hair touched. This made Luo Tian feel some resentment, recalling the thunder trial that nearly killed him. He felt like cursing.

"One... two..." Duan Yu Yan dodged five thunder trials without a scratch, and even the earth trial passed smoothly, leaving Luo Tian and Zheng Xin amazed.

Chapter 473: The Despair of the Human Trial ()

Chapter 473: The Despair of the Human Trial

Under Luo Tian's jealous gaze, Duan Yu Yan finally faced her third trial—the human trial.

"Human trial!" Luo Tian's face showed amusement, watching the gray mist descend from the sky.

"Once I pass this, I'll be Nascent Soul! Haha!" Duan Yu Yan laughed, her voice echoing across the open ground.

"This..." Zheng Xin and Leng Qiuchan looked at the gradually forming human figure, feeling a strange familiarity.

In their confusion, the gray figure finally solidified, leaving Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin—along with Duan Yu Yan undergoing the trial—stunned.

"This... am I dreaming?" Zheng Xin rubbed his eyes, staring repeatedly at the gray figure identical to Luo Tian.

"Luo Tian, you!" Leng Qiuchan couldn't speak, his usually calm face showing intense shock.

They were both from major sects and knew what it meant for a human trial to manifest Luo Tian's form.

"I curse, how am I supposed to reach Nascent Soul!" Zheng Xin shouted angrily, his gaze full of anger at Luo Tian.

Seeing Zheng Xin's resentful look, Luo Tian sauntered over and patted his head: "Don't worry, I'll help you!"

"Go away..." Zheng Xin now looked at Luo Tian with increasing anger. He knew Luo Tian's strength, and he had no chance against him.

"Good, let me see the difference between us!" Leng Qiuchan clenched his fists, gazing at Duan Yu Yan undergoing the trial.

At this moment, Duan Yu Yan's face showed seriousness. The fusion of Three Thousand Blazing Flame Fire had greatly enhanced her strength, and she believed she could now withstand Luo Tian. However, she hadn't expected the human trial's Luo Tian to be so powerful.

The fierce attacks came like waves, one after another, making Duan Yu Yan struggle. More surprisingly, her Three Thousand Blazing Flame Fire couldn't even harm the gray mist's core.

Though she hadn't fully unleashed Three Thousand Blazing Flame Fire's power, it was still beyond most people's endurance. Even Nascent Soul experts could be injured.

"Luo Tian, help Yu Yan!" Zheng Xin looked at Duan Yu Yan falling behind and showed anxiety.

"Don't rush; she's just mastering this body, and实战 is beneficial for her quick integration. Plus, she had some tricks in the thunder trial; she needs more practice..." Luo Tian smiled softly.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin nodded. Though Duan Yu Yan was currently behind, her movements were becoming increasingly agile.

The roaring sounds continued between Duan Yu Yan and the gray Luo Tian, an hour passing quietly.

As time passed, Duan Yu Yan gradually grew weary. If not for the Three Thousand Blazing Flame Fire, she would have already given up.

"Enough!" Luo Tian mentally calculated, his powerful spiritual sense transmitting a voice into Duan Yu Yan's mind.

Hearing Luo Tian's transmission, Duan Yu Yan was startled. Then a torrent of fire instantly spread, and she darted toward Luo Tian like an agile swallow, striking his vital points.

"This..." Zheng Xin looked puzzled at Luo Tian, unsure what magic he had used on Duan Yu Yan.

Luo Tian smiled slightly and spoke: "The one who knows me best is myself. I should know which move the gray mist will use!"

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Zheng Xin's face showed a hint of joy, his gaze shining.

"By the way, Luo Tian, once I reach Nascent Soul, can you come to Jifeng Valley?" Zheng Xin rubbed his hands, no longer showing anger from before. Now, Luo Tian was like a cheat device to him.

"Go away... who told you to go away..." Luo Tian kicked Zheng Xin with a grumble, gazing at Duan Yu Yan who had gained the upper hand.

Luo Tian felt a bad premonition, sensing that becoming Nascent Soul's third trial wasn't good.

After another hour of battle, with Luo Tian's help, Duan Yu Yan finally defeated the gray Luo Tian and officially entered Nascent Soul. However, her commotion was nothing compared to Luo Tian's.

After everything ended, red spiritual energy like a waterfall flowed into Duan Yu Yan's body, marking her official entry into Nascent Soul.

Red wings suddenly spread, Duan Yu Yan's lively laughter echoed in the sky. At this moment, she flew like a phoenix, making Zheng Xin drool.

"Xi xi... Fool... you must work harder!" Duan Yu Yan smiled, landing in front of Zheng Xin and hugging him.

Zheng Xin also showed excitement, embracing Duan Yu Yan in his arms, his gaze filled with tenderness.

"Alright, don't linger here; we should return!" Luo Tian smiled, happy for the two.

"Brother, thank you!" Zheng Xin surprisingly didn't chatter but showed a solemn expression, bowing to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian kicked Zheng Xin away with one foot and scolded: "Don't pull that with me!"

"Haha..." Zheng Xin laughed, returning to Luo Tian's side and resuming his usual state.

The four didn't rush but laughed as they walked toward Beiming City.

As the four just entered Beiming City, their faces changed. They all took out their jade pendants. Previously, since the four had sneaked out, they placed the pendants in their storage rings without caring about the messages inside.

Now that Duan Yu Yan had a body and they planned to return, they didn't care if someone could find them through the pendants.

As soon as they took out the pendants, four voices echoed in their minds.

"Little scoundrel, hurry back with Duan Yu Yan; if you don't return, the Dangzong will tear down our Jifeng Valley!" Zheng Hongsheng's voice echoed in Zheng Xin's mind.

"Yu Yan, return quickly and marry Zheng Xin; the Dangzong has changed!" Duan Yu Yan's father transmitted through the jade pendant.

"You two, don't play around; take Zheng Xin and Duan Yu Yan to Jifeng Valley. Both of you are getting married; I and the elders have already headed to Jifeng Valley. Return quickly!" Leng Hongcai's voice echoed in Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan's minds.

Chapter 474: Returning to Jifeng Valley ()

Chapter 474: Returning to Jifeng Valley

"Congratulations!" Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan smiled, addressing Zheng Xin and Duan Yu Yan.

"Congratulations for what? We need to return quickly!" Zheng Xin's voice showed urgency, explaining the message he received to Luo Tian and others.

Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan were stunned, nodding. The four hurried into Beiming City, giving instructions to the Huang Family. Luo Tian also taught the Huang Family his three techniques of "Soul-Shattering Spear" since it belonged to them.

After finishing, the four left Beichang County and flew toward Kunlun Mountain with Duan Yu Yan and Zheng Xin each carrying one.

...

Kunlun Mountain, Jifeng Valley.

Whistling winds blew through the deep Jifeng Valley, a blue barrier enclosing the sect, shielding it from the outside's fierce winds.
