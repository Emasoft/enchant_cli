“Good. Here, battle merits are extremely important. Starting tomorrow, we will also follow the main force out to kill ghostly creatures, striving to obtain ten thousand battle merits within the shortest time possible. This way, one of us can become a squad leader and gain official status within the military camp,” Ye Chen said, his voice carrying confidence.

“This…” Upon hearing Ye Chen’s words, Qiuqian Di furrowed his brows slightly but said nothing more. Others also fell silent for a moment.

“I’m sorry, I don’t wish to go out of the city to hunt ghostly creatures,” Luo Tian said softly, directly refusing.

Ghostly creatures—Luo Tian would eventually have to hunt them. But not now. Having just arrived in Bountiful Heaven City, immediately rushing out to hunt them was unwise and far too dangerous.

Moreover, Luo Tian had discovered through examining the jade slip that there were other ways to obtain battle merits within Bountiful Heaven City, such as alchemy and weapon forging. Among these, the most critical was the Evil-Dispelling Pills. In Bountiful Heaven City, such pills were undoubtedly precious.

Luo Tian had just realized that many people carried residual ghostly energy within their bodies. Over time, this would become a problem. The purpose of Evil-Dispelling Pills was to expel the accumulated ghostly energy from one’s body.

However, Evil-Dispelling Pills were extremely rare within Bountiful Heaven City. Only squad leaders received one each month. This was because there were too few alchemists in the city. Although the realm of immortals had many alchemists, they were too scattered. Moreover, Evil-Dispelling Pills were a fifth-grade elixir—beyond the capacity of most alchemists to craft.

“What did you say?” Ye Chen’s face instantly darkened with displeasure. He had not expected anyone to defy him.

“I said I don’t want to go out of the city immediately to hunt ghostly creatures!” Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly. He felt Ye Chen had become overly self-assured. From the beginning, he had merely suggested discussing their next steps, yet Ye Chen had already treated him as an subordinate.

“Earlier, everyone said we would stick together. Now you say you won’t join us—what does that mean?” Ye Chen’s eyes flashed coldly.

“Senior Brother Tian, Senior Brother Ye, we are all comrades. Let’s not let this small matter sour our relationship. Let’s think it through carefully,” Ye Liangchen interjected, seeing the two men argue. Luo Tian and Ye Chen were both adopted sons of Ye Wudao, and he was close to both. He hoped they could coexist peacefully.

“Hmph. Some people, because they have a little strength, become selfish and ungrateful. They don’t know the meaning of ‘there’s always someone better.’ When Senior Brother Ye became famous and shook Star River Prefecture, those people were probably still digging mud in the Lower Three Heavens!” Ye Fu seized the opportunity to mock, his eyes gleaming with mischief.

But before Ye Fu could finish speaking, a pair of icy eyes sent him trembling.

“In the Washing Stars Pool, I killed you. Do you think I wouldn’t do it now?” Luo Tian coldly replied. His reason for not wanting to be with these people was also due to Ye Fu and Ye Die.

On the battlefield, danger was everywhere. Luo Tian would not entrust his back to people like Ye Fu and Ye Die.

“Fine. If some people want to go it alone, we won’t stop them. But don’t come crying for our help later,” Ye Chen said coldly, clenching his fists tightly and staring intently at Luo Tian.

“Do as you please,” Luo Tian lightly shook his head, gazing at Ye Liangchen with a hint of apology. “Liangchen, I suppose you don’t want to go out either. Let’s stay in the city for three months before going out, okay?”

“I…” Ye Liangchen stammered, unsure of where to stand.

“Senior Brother Ye, I actually…” Ye Liangchen looked at Ye Chen, his expression troubled.

“Liangchen, stay here with me. I’ll split my battle merits with you half,” Ye Chen’s coldness melted into a gentle smile. He knew Ye Liangchen was cowardly and had never intended to let him follow them.

“Senior Brother Ye, Tian Ge isn’t saying it that way,” Ye Liangchen spoke again, trying to ease the tension between them.

“Enough. I, Ye Chen, will never associate with him!” Ye Chen sneered and turned away.

Ye Fu and others glanced at Luo Tian, some with smug satisfaction. They followed Ye Chen’s path.

Qiuqian Di furrowed his brows slightly, a contemplative look in his eyes before relaxing and walking toward Ye Chen.

With the group parting on bad terms, the small squad newly formed in Star River Prefecture disintegrated within moments.

Other sects’ squads either remained together or, like Luo Tian’s group, split apart instantly.

“Liangchen, your Senior Brother Ye has quite the character,” Luo Tian smiled slightly before looking toward the two groups approaching him.

“Luo Tian! It’s been a long time!” Man Hun laughed heartily, his voice filled with excitement. He had also been at the Struggle for Heaven battle before, but they hadn’t spoken.

“Luo Tian!” Jin Xiyang walked over without expression, his eyes filled with battle intent.

“Haha, it’s been a while!” Luo Tian laughed and patted Man Hun’s shoulder. His gaze also fell on Jin Xiyang.

“Don’t look so grim. We’re all from the same village, why be like that?” Luo Tian shook his head lightly. Though he sensed battle intent in Jin Xiyang’s eyes, there was no killing intent.

“Haha, new recruits! Come here!” Just as the three met, a loud laugh echoed in their ears. Several burly figures walked from outside the courtyard.

A large man, shirtless with black wounds all over his body, eyes fierce. Behind him were several more men, gazing at nearly a thousand sect disciples.

Each disciple looked puzzled but didn’t know who they were. They only approached the few men.

At the same time, other veteran soldiers in the courtyard wore smiles. They quickly surrounded the thousand recruits.

“Haha, new recruits are great! When I first joined the military camp, they almost took my pants!” A young man sighed, muttering to himself.

“This year finally our turn!” Other veterans muttered as well, their eyes unkindly watching Luo Tian’s group.

“Come on, new recruits! Since you have no battle merits here in Bountiful Heaven City, we old-timers naturally need to take care of you. Now you can exchange your treasures with us for battle merits!” The leading man shouted.

“Exchange battle merits?” Upon hearing the man’s words, people’s eyes lit up. Yet no one dared to step forward, their gazes sensing the men’s ill intentions.

“I’ll do it!” A genius shouted and stepped forward, his face tense.

“Tianchen Sect’s Ba Jianzhong?” Recognizing the youth, people immediately identified him and awaited his exchange.

“Sir, how exactly does this exchange work?” The youth respectfully asked, his face showing deference.

“First show me your items. If they are good, you’ll get plenty of merits!” The man’s eyes brightened and spoke to the youth.

“Wum….” The youth waved his hand, revealing an inferior-grade spiritual artifact before the crowd.

“Sir, how many merits can this inferior-grade spiritual artifact exchange for?” Ba Jianzhong asked, his eyes filled with anticipation. If he could obtain many merits, he had more treasures to exchange. The priority for everyone was to gather ten thousand merits and ascend to squad leader.

“Hmph, an inferior-grade spiritual artifact. Not bad. One thousand merits!” The man said and grabbed the artifact, then marked one thousand merits on the youth’s wrist.

“One thousand!” Upon hearing this number, people gasped. They hadn’t expected such a high exchange rate.

They had come from their sects, carrying many good items. If they followed this method, obtaining ten thousand merits would be effortless.

“Me too! I want to exchange for merits!” People immediately clamored, shouting excitedly.

“Don’t rush. We old-timers will help you exchange!” Other veterans spoke, their eyes equally excited.

In an instant, each sect disciple approached other veterans and began exchanging treasures.

“Senior Brother Tian, we should exchange too? I’m afraid those veterans will take all the merits!” Ye Liangchen, seeing the chaos in the crowd, became anxious.

“It’s not that simple. These people are really lacking common sense. I’ve already sensed something wrong, yet they didn’t notice!” Man Hun shook his head and stopped his companion.

Some people also stood still, not moving, waiting for developments.

“Only one merit for ten inferior-grade spiritual artifacts! How is this possible!” A furious shout echoed. It was Ba Jianzhong again, his face angry as he glared at the man who had exchanged for him.

“What’s wrong? You got more than enough!” The man smiled, looking down at Ba Jianzhong with disdain.

“How could this be? I exchanged one hundred fourth-grade elixirs for ten merits… I…” Frustrated voices echoed. Almost everyone participating in the exchange looked angry.

“I’m not exchanging anymore!” A youth shouted, his eyes burning with fury at the opponent.

“This is the rule! One hand pays, one hand receives. Even if you take it to the regiment commander, we still have reason!”

“Boy, this is your lesson. Don’t always think you can take advantage. In the end, it’ll be you who suffers!”

“This is our advice to you!” The man laughed and other veterans also smiled.

“Do you want to fight? If not, try it!” Several veterans spoke, their voices filled with contempt.

“I’ll fight you!” A youth shouted and unleashed his cultivation level of Heavenly Immortal Late Stage, rushing toward the veteran who had exchanged for him.

“Go back!” The veteran laughed and punched downward. With a thunderous sound, he clashed with the youth’s fist. The youth was instantly thrown backward, spitting blood and collapsing on the ground.

“Did you feel it?” Man Hun narrowed his eyes, gazing at the veteran and spoke softly.

“Terrifying combat experience. Just like us!” Jin Xiyang said, his eyes filled with surprise.

The veteran’s attack was identical to that of the black-armored soldiers before—precise and seizing the opponent's vital point, rendering their fists powerless.

Meanwhile, others also fought angrily, but the results were similar. Even sect disciples were brutally beaten by these veterans.

“This is the gap. You people are geniuses, and perhaps you’ll make a name in the Eighth Army later. But now, you’re trash—lowest level in the entire Eighth Army!” The man said with disdain.

“Alright, those who have exchanged merits go to the side. Those remaining—come exchange!” The man looked at the remaining people, about three or four hundred still unexchanged. This included Luo Tian and his group.

“I won’t exchange!” A youth defiantly replied, causing people to be momentarily stunned before their eyes flashed with excitement.

Dressed in white, his eyes deep and intense. His aura was formidable, already at the threshold of True Immortal. He gazed at the man.

“Daylight!” People’s faces lit up, even Ye Chen’s face showed a hint of seriousness.

“Middle Heaven Sect, the top sect in the Middle Heavens, First Sky White Family!”

“We won’t exchange!” Daylight’s words hadn’t finished when another voice echoed, dressed in blue, his eyes like the sun.

“Second Sect, Silk Spider Valley, Qin He Feng!” The crowd gasped again, more excited.

“We also disagree!” Ye Chen shouted loudly and stepped forward, causing a commotion.

“Three top sects’ geniuses have stood up!” People were excited, as Daylight, Qin He Feng, and Ye Chen were renowned in the Middle Heavens. Everyone knew they were like sect disciples of their respective sects.

“We also disagree… we are…” More people stepped forward, their eyes filled with defiance.

Seven groups in total—seven of the top sects from the Middle Heavens. These seven groups represented the strongest young talents in the Middle Heavens, as their sects were among the top seven. These seven sects had close ties with the Nine Immortal Mountains.

Each sect was closely connected to the Nine Immortal Mountains, just like Star River Prefecture and Bountiful Heaven Mountain.

“Haha, every world has a few stubborn bones!” Seeing the people who had stood up, the man laughed loudly, his voice filled with contempt. However, his eyes regarded them seriously. Years of battlefield experience had made these veterans more perceptive than ordinary people.

“They want to exchange, so we’ll exchange!” Those still standing shouted, clearly taking Daylight and others as their leaders.

“Senior Brother Tian, should we also step forward?” Ye Liangchen looked at Luo Tian with concern.

“No. The first to stick out gets shot,” Luo Tian lightly shook his head. Though he didn’t want to waste, he wasn’t against using some resources to avoid unnecessary trouble, as long as it didn’t touch his底线.

“Hey Senior Brother Tian, in this critical moment, can you help Senior Brother Ye?” Ye Liangchen looked at Ye Chen standing there, his eyes full of concern.

“Brothers, let’s give these stubborn bones a taste!” Before Luo Tian could respond, the leading man shouted and flew into the air toward Daylight.

“Haha, beat these little bastards!” Others also shouted, and about ten thousand people rushed toward Daylight’s group.

“You’re despicable!” Daylight roared and punched, clashing with the man. The man retreated slightly, but Daylight also took two steps back. However, as he stepped back, seven or eight punches hit him, making his face pale instantly.

Ye Chen and Qin He Feng also fought, constantly battling against the surrounding people.

Ten thousand versus dozens. And these veterans were exceptionally strong and ruthless.

This was Bountiful Heaven City, where the black-armored soldiers had previously told them that martial arts could not be used within the camp. Thus, the situation was clear—within moments, dozens were subdued and lay on the ground with bruises.

“You have guts. Fight fair!” The dozens shouted. If it were just about strength, they could definitely beat these veterans. But the enemy was too numerous and overwhelmed them.

“Indeed…” Luo Tian lightly shook his head, a slight smile in his eyes.

“Haha, fight fair? You’re really naive. This is the second lesson we veterans give you. This is a battlefield, set aside your thoughts of fair combat. There’s only one thing—victory or defeat. If it takes any means, even if they seem dishonorable to you, we’ll use them!” The man said coldly.

“This is where we can’t lose. If we fail, and the ghostly creatures break through Bountiful Heaven City, then people in the Middle Heavens will suffer. The sects behind us will also be affected!” The man spoke loudly, making the sect disciples’ geniuses fall silent.

Chapter 2014: Explosion

The Middle Heavens’ geniuses looked contemplative, but still felt reluctant. After all, those things were their own.

“How about it? Now are you going to exchange or not?” The leading man looked at those who hadn’t joined the fight and the ones lying on the ground—Ye Chen, Daylight, etc.

Continuous blows had made many geniuses feel like vomiting. Their sharpness was dulled, and their mindset completely changed due to the hellish journey.

Cruel. The entire hell was cruel, vastly different from their usual world.

“Exchange!” Luo Tian smiled and waved his hand. One hundred fourth-grade elixirs appeared before the man.

“Such a lot!” Upon seeing these one hundred elixirs, people around him were stunned. Though it wasn’t many, it was a considerable sum for these veterans.

“Even Luo Tian has submitted?” People around him looked surprised.

Luo Tian wasn’t the strongest, but he was no slouch. His ruthlessness had already left an impression on them. Many True Immortals had died at his hands.

“Good, kid, you’re smart!” The man laughed and waved his hand. One merit was marked on Luo Tian’s wrist.

“Wum…” Luo Tian waved his hand again, and another hundred fourth-grade elixirs appeared. He spoke softly: “These are my brother’s!”

“Hmph!” The man waved his hand again and marked one merit on Ye Liangchen’s wrist.

Luo Tian waved his hand once more, and another two hundred elixirs appeared around him. The veterans’ faces instantly showed shock.

“Who is this youth? How could he produce so many elixirs?” People looked at Luo Tian with shock.

“These are my two brothers!” Luo Tian spoke again, gazing at the veterans around him.

“Four hundred elixirs—precious to me. No one has ever taken them from me before!”

“But today, you are the first to take something from me without paying any price!”

“However, I’ve taken them out because you are worthy of respect. You are worthy of me giving something!”

Luo Tian spoke loudly, and the veterans’ faces changed.

“Haha, brother, you’re my kind of person. I’m Zhang Desheng. Want to join my team?” The man laughed and patted Luo Tian’s shoulder.

“No, I’m used to going it alone. Thanks!” Luo Tian lightly shook his head and then sat down in a corner.

Seeing that Luo Tian had exchanged, others also took out their items and reluctantly exchanged merits.

These people were the elites of the Middle Heavens, and their treasures weren’t bad. The veterans would gain more chances to survive by obtaining them.

Daylight and Ye Chen looked at Luo Tian with darkened expressions. His previous words had been resolute, changing people’s attitudes toward the veterans and even making them feel a bit guilty for the veterans.

But this speech had put Daylight and Ye Chen in an awkward position, making them appear disrespectful to the elders.

“Senior Brother Tian, you’re really amazing. Even though you couldn’t fight, you still showed off!” Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen walked through Bountiful Heaven City’s streets. Ye Liangchen smiled as he spoke to Luo Tian.

“Let’s go find a place first. Find the recipe for Evil-Dispelling Pills, refine them, exchange for ten thousand merits, challenge a squad leader to get a fixed place,” Luo Tian muttered and found a hall. A group of soldiers with proud expressions walked out.

Not long after, Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen entered the hall. A soldier stood there with a platform in front of him, and shelves behind it filled with jade slips.

“Hello, I want a recipe for Evil-Dispelling Pills!” Luo Tian smiled and spoke to the soldier.

“One merit!” The soldier coldly replied, not looking at Luo Tian. Evil-Dispelling Pills were precious in Bountiful Heaven City, and the recipe was open to the public. Thus, it was the cheapest item in Bountiful Heaven City.

Luo Tian waved his hand and one merit disappeared. In an instant, Luo Tian was back to zero merits.

After obtaining the recipe for Evil-Dispelling Pills, Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen returned to the courtyard. The courtyard had now calmed down, and people were fewer. Many had gone out to hunt ghostly creatures alone, while others had also left to explore Bountiful Heaven City.

Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen found a place to sit. They had just sat down when two sharp glances fell on Luo Tian—Daylight and Ye Chen were sitting there, their injuries still unhealed.

At this point, the three had shifted their hatred to Luo Tian. However, Luo Tian’s fearsome reputation made them know it wouldn’t be easy to take him down.

“Let’s go out. I need to quickly rise to the rank of squad leader. Then, if he still acts like this, I’ll have the power to decide his fate. If I say a word, he will die!” Daylight spoke harshly, glaring at Luo Tian.

“Evil-Dispelling Pills—ghostly energy from hell is condensed into pills. No other methods are needed…” Luo Tian ignored their glances and focused on refining Evil-Dispelling Pills.

“Strange elixir!” Not long after, Luo Tian finished reading the recipe and muttered in admiration.

“Only need to condense this ghostly energy from the world. No spiritual energy, no medicinal herbs!” This was Luo Tian’s first time encountering such an elixir.

“Although the ghostly energy in Bountiful Heaven City is slightly thinner than outside, it’s still dense. It even suppresses spiritual energy!” Luo Tian muttered and waved his hand. A golden cauldron thundered down.

The heavy cauldron immediately drew attention, and people gazed at the Heavenly Extreme Flame Cauldron with surprise.

“Is this an alchemical cauldron?”

“Is this Luo Tian an alchemist?” People were stunned, gazing at Luo Tian with disbelief.

“Boom…” Seven-colored flames rushed into the Heavenly Extreme Flame Cauldron. Nine fire dragons coiled around it.

“What is he doing now? Trying to refine elixirs?” People were puzzled. Although they found it strange that Luo Tian was an alchemist, they accepted the fact that he was one.

Among these people were also many alchemists, but their levels weren’t high—most were only first or second-grade. None were high-level alchemists.

“Wum…” As people discussed and wondered about Luo Tian’s grade as an alchemist, a strong suction came from the Heavenly Extreme Flame Cauldron.

“Ugh…” A cold atmosphere descended from the sky, rushing into the alchemical cauldron like a thousand evil ghosts howling. The cold atmosphere even caused black ice to form on the hot Heavenly Extreme Flame Cauldron.

“Absorbing ghostly energy. Is he trying to refine Evil-Dispelling Pills?” People looked at the ghostly energy absorbed into the cauldron and their faces changed.

“Impossible! Evil-Dispelling Pills are fifth-grade elixirs. How could he refine them!” People exclaimed, their eyes filled with disbelief.

Not only did the geniuses are shocked, but even the veterans showed expressions of surprise. They gazed at Luo Tian with hurried breaths.

Evil-Dispelling Pills were crucial for Bountiful Heaven City. They knew these elixirs represented a large number of merits and the ability to remove ghostly energy from one’s body.

“If Luo Tian can refine Evil-Dispelling Pills, he will definitely become a star in Bountiful Heaven City. Various small factions will compete for him!” People looked at Luo Tian with anticipation.

Not only did the veterans outside the courtyard pay attention to Luo Tian, but even those in the courtyard—commanders and thousand-commanders—were watching him. The elixir’s importance was too great.

Time passed slowly. One hour had finally passed, and a series of howls echoed in people’s ears.

“Boom… Boom…” Thunderous sounds rose from the Heavenly Extreme Flame Cauldron, making people’s faces change again.

“Liangchen, run!” However, before people could finish shouting, Luo Tian shouted at Ye Liangchen and pulled him to run.

“Damn it! It’s an explosion!” As Luo Tian ran, the veterans’ faces also changed. They felt a crisis and rushed around.

“Boom…” A thunderous explosion echoed, shaking the entire courtyard as if it were an earthquake. A black column of light shot up to the sky, piercing through heaven and earth.

The powerful shockwave spread outward. Fortunately, Bountiful Heaven City was protected by a strong formation; otherwise, this explosion would have completely destroyed the courtyard.

The sky cracked open. Even the dark skies seemed to be pierced, revealing a sliver of sunlight and causing people in Bountiful Heaven City to be astonished.

The explosion faded, and the world returned to calm. People in the courtyard gazed at Luo Tian with admiration.

“Damn it! Who is this fool? He’s asking for death!”

“Damn it, I’ll kill him. My spirit beast was disturbed!”

“Damn it, he interrupted my rest. I just killed a ghostly creature of the Heavenly Immortal Middle Stage and was exhausted!” Shouts of anger echoed, making Luo Tian shiver. He felt he had caused a big trouble.

“Luo Tian! I’ll kill you!” In the courtyard, many people looked at Luo Tian with anger and fury.

“Don’t do this. We are all geniuses. It’s not good to ganged up on him!” Ye Liangchen trembled, watching the several figures approaching them.

Chapter 2015: Behind the Scenes

Several figures, in a pitiful state with blackened bodies and emitting smoke, were those who had not left after being subdued by the veterans. However, they now looked pitiful.

They had just recovered from their injuries and were discussing what to do next when the explosion sounded. They hadn’t had time to escape, and if they hadn’t reacted quickly, they would have been hit harder.

“Everything was a misunderstanding. Everything was a misunderstanding!” Ye Liangchen shouted, not expecting Luo Tian to cause such a big commotion.

“Senior Brother Ye, step aside. You are the disciple of Star River Prefecture; we dare not touch you. But what is he? Today I’ll teach him a lesson. If I don’t, it’s hard to get rid of this anger in my heart!” Thirty or so people surrounded Luo Tian, their eyes fierce.

“Everyone, I’m sorry. I can also compensate appropriately!”

“But if you go too far, I Luo Tian am not someone to be bullied!” Luo Tian took a step forward and gazed at the thirty people. Although these people were geniuses from the Middle Heavens, Luo Tian was fearless.

“Damn it! Who is this fool? Wanting to turn the world upside down!” As people were in chaos, a furious voice echoed. A man with a beard walked out from the inner courtyard.

“Respect the thousand-commander!” Upon seeing the man, especially his purple robe, people’s faces changed and they respectfully bowed to him.

The man wore a purple robe, representing the position of thousand-commander. A thousand-commander was definitely one of Bountiful Heaven City’s core figures!

There were a total of ten thousand thousand-commanders in Bountiful Heaven City. Though it seemed many, Bountiful Heaven City was vast. Ten thousand each leading a thousand people would make ten million. Above thousand-commanders were ten-thousand commanders...

“Kid, what are you messing with? Do you think I’ll kill you?” The man spoke. One word from him and Luo Tian would be dead.

“Report to the thousand-commander, refining Evil-Dispelling Pills…” Luo Tian was momentarily stunned. The man’s aura created a strong sense of danger, and the other people who had walked out from the crowd also gave Luo Tian this feeling.

“Refine your grandmother’s leg, disturbing my spirit beast. Can you take responsibility?” Another purple-robed man spoke loudly.

“Kill him!” A pale-faced youth coldly said and turned to walk into the inner courtyard. Behind him, five people also had cold expressions. Each was of Heavenly Immortal Early Stage. More notably, these five wore yellow robes, representing the position of ten-thousand commander.

“Kill me?” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with fury. He gazed at the youth who had turned away. If he truly fought, Luo Tian would not sit idly by.

Seeing that the purple-robed man had shown killing intent, those who had previously vowed to teach Luo Tian a lesson now wore mocking expressions.

“Thousand-commander, this brother just arrived and doesn’t know our Bountiful Heaven City’s rules. Please let him go, as it was his first offense,” Zhang Desheng said respectfully to the purple-robed thousand-commander.

“Smack!”

A clear sound echoed. Zhang Desheng was immediately slapped and flew backward, his strong body falling to the ground.

The pale-faced youth wiped his hands and gazed at Zhang Desheng: “Did I say you could command me?”

“I didn’t want to kill you. But because he interceded, I now want to kill him more!”

“Remember, you were killed by him!”

The youth gazed at Luo Tian with a flicker of black energy in his eyes and then waved his hand. A golden hand, like a mountain, pressed down toward Luo Tian.

“True Immortal Middle Stage!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed with seriousness. He felt a heavy pressure, but one True Immortal Middle Stage was not enough to make him submit.

“Wum…” The Splitting Heaven Spear hummed and shot out. A golden spear image pierced the sky, rushing toward the golden hand.

“Still resisting? You’re looking for death!” The youth saw the golden spear and showed a cold expression. He then pressed down with his other hand.

In a golden hall, a middle-aged man sat there, flipping through jade slips. These slips contained the information of all the geniuses who had entered Bountiful Heaven City.

“This kid is still as troublesome as ever,” the middle-aged man smiled and then closed the jade slips. He touched them, sending out waves.

“Wum…” At the same time, nearly ten thousand thousand-commanders throughout Bountiful Heaven City received a message. Their faces slightly changed.

Especially the purple-robed ten-thousand commander who had wanted to crush Luo Tian, his face changed abruptly. The power of the pressing hand weakened.

“This person actually knows the ten-thousand commander!” Another two purple-robed men’s faces also slightly changed. They were shocked but did not show it.

“Damn, how did this kid know him!” The pale-faced youth trembled. Thinking of the person’s methods, he instinctively shivered.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly. The golden spear pierced the golden hand, and an invisible wave spread outward.

“Good. You have strong strength. I’ll overlook this slight offense. These are two Evil-Dispelling Pills, a reward for you!” The youth waved his hand and dropped two black pills into Luo Tian’s hands.

The crowd was stunned. Everyone looked at Luo Tian with disbelief, especially the veterans. They hadn’t expected the youth’s change to be so fast.

“Who is that? That was a thousand-commander! Known as Blood Snake Bai Shuize, he’s always ruthless. People who fell into his hands never had a good end. Yet Luo Tian was treated with respect, not only avoiding death but also receiving two Evil-Dispelling Pills.”

Luo Tian was also puzzled. He didn’t know why Bai Shuize had changed so much—before he wanted to kill him, now treating him like this.

“That Bai Shuize is afraid!” The other two purple-robed men smiled slightly and waved their hands, giving Luo Tian two more Evil-Dispelling Pills.

“Boy, do well. Your future will definitely be limitless!” The two thousand-commanders spoke and then walked into the area of the purple-robed in the courtyard.

Bai Shuize also said nothing, only gazing at Luo Tian deeply before leaving. The crowd was stunned, even the ten-thousand commanders were confused.

“Haha, brother, if you need help in the future, just say so!”

“Little brother, you can try refining elixirs in my courtyard. My courtyard has a formation that minimizes destruction!” Many ten-thousand commanders smiled warmly, no longer angry.

Those who had previously vowed to kill Luo Tian disappeared and hid far away.

“Thank you, thank you…” Luo Tian quickly spoke, chatting with them. His mind was full of confusion about who was supporting him behind the scenes.

“Whoever it is, they must be good with me!” Luo Tian constantly guessed in his mind but couldn’t figure it out.

“Jiang Yuansheng?” Luo Tian thought of the old beggar who had said he would come to Bountiful Heaven City. But soon, he dismissed it. Jiang Yuansheng was eccentric and wouldn’t help him without reason.

Luo Tian didn’t think much. Since the person hadn’t appeared, they must have their own plans. He just needed to proceed with his own ideas. As for the ten-thousand commanders’ invitations, he politely declined, not wanting to owe anyone a favor.
