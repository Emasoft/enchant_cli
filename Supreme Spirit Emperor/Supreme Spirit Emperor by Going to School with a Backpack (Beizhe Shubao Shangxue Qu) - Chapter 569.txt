The heavens trembled as collision sounds echoed. Qiu Long spat blood, his body flying backward and crashing onto the ground in a pitiful heap.

“Roar……” A horde of zombies immediately lunged at Qiu Long, their robust bodies battered by punches from a dozen zombies.

“Kill!” As Qiu Long resisted Yang Huanyu’s attack, Su Dan and Wang Gang five others launched their assault. Five martial arts techniques descended with immense fluctuations, each radiating powerful waves toward Yang Huanyu’s direction.

“Boom……” A massive black coffin suddenly appeared behind Yang Huanyu, enveloping him completely.

Boom boom boom……

The deafening sound of explosions soared into the sky, wild explosive fluctuations spreading outward and annihilating vast numbers of dry corpses. Wang Gang’s group looked grim.

“Damn it, if we had entered the Late-stage Immortal realm, we wouldn’t be so passive!” Wang Gang’s group looked grim. They had reached a bottleneck and were about to enter the Late-stage Immortal realm, but this incident occurred.

Yang Huanyu was a thorn in their side, yet the six of them were no pushovers. However, the level disparity was too great; only Su Dan among the six had reached the Late-stage Immortal realm, and even she was not adept at direct combat.

The black coffin finally shattered under their combined attacks, and Yang Huanyu emerged from the shockwave, rushing toward Su Dan.

Su Dan opened his mouth and spat out a stream of purple qi, emitting fragrant scents. Yang Huanyu’s figure moved like lightning, breaking through the purple qi. His body momentarily froze, his eyes losing focus, but he quickly regained composure and lunged toward Su Dan with a thrust.

Su Dan’s face flickered slightly, his body shifting aside as the sharp tip of his halberd severed a strand of Su Dan’s long hair. Su Dan narrowly evaded Yang Huanyu’s attack.

Yang Huanyu struck back and never lingered for a second strike, as he had no opportunity to attack again.

“Then I’ll have to switch targets!” Yang Huanyu sneered, his gaze finally locking onto Qiu Long.

Yang Huanyu’s body surged toward Qiu Long again, the black halberd radiating ominous darkness.

“Do you think I’m the weakest? You underestimate people too much!” Qiu Long’s face twisted with anger, his fists radiating divine laws as his arms swelled.

“Not because I look down on you, but because you’re the stupidest!” Yang Huanyu smiled faintly and brought his halberd down again.

“You dare to provoke me!” Qiu Long roared, launching two iron fists that collided with the black halberd.

This time both men retreated, Qiu Long’s body bearing cracks and his eyes flashing madness.

A moon of darkness rose, shattering the heavens as it pressed down on Yang Huanyu. The Rebirth Hall’s eyes trembled incessantly.

“Lunar eclipse!” The sky suddenly darkened, darkness instantly enveloping the world, blinding all.

“This is our last chance!” Su Dan and the others launched another attack, this time unleashing their ultimate techniques to finish the battle.

The heavens roared with destruction, waves of annihilation echoing from the darkness. When the darkness faded and dust settled, they panted heavily, gazing at the scattered smoke.

“We should have finished it by now. If not, I truly lack strength!” Hong Tao spoke, his voice weary.

But the emergence of a black coffin made their hearts tighten.

“Not possible! That’s why Luo Chen feared him so much; he still didn’t die!” They cursed.

The black coffin lid lifted, and Yang Huanyu stepped out, his gaze locking onto the six. A trickle of blood flowed from his lips, indicating he hadn’t fared well either.

“Unexpected!” Yang Huanyu smiled calmly, his black coffin suddenly soaring upward and expanding to crush the six standing together.

“Hold fast!” Wang Gang shouted, the six exchanging glances. Wang Gang and Su Dan stood before four others, beginning to resist the approaching dry corpses while Mocheng and Hong Tao lifted their hands to block the black coffin.

“One chance, I can still use this technique. Though not as strong as him, I’ll surely find its weakness!” Mocheng’s eyes gleamed with calmness.

“Boom…” The next moment, the black coffin crushed down upon the six.

“Crack…” Their feet cracked as they gritted their teeth, staring at the black coffin above.

“Ghost Army Passage!” Yang Huanyu’s black halberd smashed down onto the coffin lid, summoning ten ghost soldiers who stood on the coffin.

“Damn it…” Each time a ghost soldier landed, Mocheng’s body trembled. Wang Gang abandoned resisting the dry corpses and joined the others to withstand the crushing coffin.

“Don’t tell me we’re going to die like this! That would be too embarrassing!” Qiu Long shouted, watching the descending coffin.

Su Dan continued to fight the dry corpses alone, while the Rebirth Hall disciples suffered heavy casualties and no one could save them.

“Let’s split up later; whoever escapes is lucky!” Mocheng whispered, his voice low. Luo Tian’s sudden departure had wounded them deeply. If Luo Tian hadn’t left, with Su Dan and Luo Tian both at Late-stage Immortal, they could have defended themselves.

“Father, save me!” Qiu Long roared, his arms trembling as he felt a mountain pressing down. At this moment, Qiu Long could only think of his heavenly father.

“Haha, I’m back, Luo Chen!” As Qiu Long’s words faded, a vortex appeared in the heavens. A black streak burst forth from it and materialized in the sky.

“Luo Chen!” Everyone was stunned, Yang Huanyu’s expression darkened as he stood atop the black coffin, gazing at Luo Tian in the sky.

“Unexpectedly, you returned to die!” Yang Huanyu chuckled.

“Qiu Long, your ‘father’ call was worth it…” Mocheng and the others chuckled, feeling lighter. To them, Luo Tian was also a freak.

“Damn it!” Seeing the black figure, Qiu Long shouted in frustration. He hadn’t expected his shout to summon someone.

“Holy Son!” The disciples struggling with the Rebirth Array were overjoyed, their first time seeing Luo Tian so excited.

Because they had suffered too much; only 1,800 remained, of which 1,000 were those who received the news but failed to arrive.

Initially, their 3,000 had been reduced to under 800 by the dry corpse army. Later, those who joined allowed them to endure—hence no deaths for a while.

Luo Tian unsheathed the Dragon Origin Sword, descending from the sky toward Yang Huanyu. The sword’s tip pierced space and appeared above Yang Huanyu instantly.

“Buzz…” The Black Ghost Halberd emitted divine light, colliding with the Dragon Origin Sword’s tip. The halberd bent immediately.

“Crack…” The earth cracked again, Wang Gang’s group paled.

“Damn it, Luo Tian, don’t fight so hard; you’ll kill us!” Qiu Long’s legs were buried in the ground as he shouted, his voice laced with resentment.

“Sorry…” Luo Tian awkwardly smiled and flew backward, standing in the sky. He waved his hand, sending a sword beam toward Yang Huanyu.

Chapter 2165: Sinful Obstacle Mirror ()

The heavens tore open, infinite sword beams shot forth from the sky toward Yang Huanyu. Yang Huanyu’s expression slightly tensed.

“Finally, a worthy opponent?” Yang Huanyu smiled, grasping the Black Ghost Halberd and rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Crack…” The heavens trembled, infinite sword beams exploded before Yang Huanyu, his robes flapped wildly as he landed on the ground.

“Thank goodness I can rest!” Qiu Long and others panted heavily, gazing at Yang Huanyu and Luo Tian charging at each other again.

“Let’s clear these zombies first!” They exchanged glances, without Yang Huanyu, they could coordinate with the Rebirth Hall disciples to eliminate the dry corpses.

“Boom…” As they prepared to move, thunderous sounds echoed from the sky. A dark cloud descended, immense pressure crushing their bodies.

Battle spirit soared; the Rebirth Array flew from Luo Tian’s hands, expanding and pressing toward Yang Huanyu.

“It’s the Rebirth Array!” Wang Gang’s group gasped, their eyes glowing with joy as they watched the dark cloud descend.

“An ultimate divine artifact?” Yang Huanyu frowned, his hands moving to weave divine laws. The black coffin that had crushed Wang Gang’s group soared upward, colliding with the Rebirth Array.

“Boom…” Thunder roared, the heavens cracked, winds reversed, and the dark sky seemed shattered like a mirror, riddled with cracks.

The black coffin disintegrated under the Rebirth Array, turning into swirling black mist sucked into a void.

“Boom…” The massive Rebirth Array landed on the ground, crushing countless dry corpses and standing before Wang Gang and Su Dan.

“Haha! Now you can’t escape, even the Rebirth Array was brought by Luo Tian. I wonder if the Sinful Obstacle Mirror came too!” Qiu Long laughed, watching Yang Huanyu coughing blood from the sky.

“Hellish Ghost Claws!” Luo Tian chanted, dark whirlwinds rising beneath the shattered sky. A black ghostly claw descended from the heavens toward Yang Huanyu.

“Buzz…” The Black Ghost Halberd emitted divine light, directly thrown by Yang Huanyu. The halberd expanded and flew toward the descending black ghostly claw.

The black halberd pierced through the black ghostly claw, pinning it to the heavens.

“Soul Burial!” Yang Huanyu’s cold voice echoed, making Mocheng’s eyes widen with excitement as he stared at Yang Huanyu.

“This time I’ll master it!” Mocheng mentally shouted, fixating on Yang Huanyu. He could sense the technique’s power, capable of resisting the Rebirth Array and nearly crushing them before.

Yang Huanyu’s hands moved rapidly, sealing hand signs into Mocheng’s eyes.

“Did you see?” Yang Huanyu smiled, suddenly turning to face Mocheng.

“Something’s wrong!” Mocheng’s expression darkened, his eyes feeling strained as an invisible wave seemed to erode them, forcibly pulling his eyes from their sockets.

“Ah…” A惨叫 echoed in Wang Gang’s group, Mocheng’s face paled as his two eyeballs slipped from their sockets.

“Come here!” Yang Huanyu extended his hand, the two moon-obsessed eyes flew toward him.

Blood flowed from Mocheng’s empty eye sockets, his body curled in agony, shouting as he clutched his head.

Hong Tao moved like lightning toward the two eyes but was too late, his fast knife flashing as he slashed at the eyes flying toward Yang Huanyu.

An invisible wave rose before the two eyes, as if severing a connection, and they fell to the ground.

“Come back!” Mocheng roared, reestablishing contact with the moon-obsessed eyes to reclaim them.

This happened in an instant, and when everyone reacted, the two eyes had already fallen from the sky.

Yang Huanyu moved swiftly toward the two eyes, but as he started moving, another figure also surged forward, arriving at the eyes simultaneously with Yang Huanyu—Luo Tian.

Both reached out, grabbing the two eyes. Meanwhile, their other hands collided.

“Boom…” A闷 sound echoed; both palms met, while each grabbed an eye and were repelled.

“Here you go!” Luo Tian waved his hand, sending the eye to Mocheng’s pale face.

“Thank you!” Mocheng was at his worst, quickly placing the eye into his empty socket. Divine laws flowed, restoring some strength but leaving the other eye hollow.

“Damn it!” Mocheng gritted his teeth, staring at Yang Huanyu standing there.

Luo Tian’s group also focused on Yang Huanyu, who had forcibly removed his eyes and replaced them with Mocheng’s moon-obsessed eyes.

Blood trickled from Yang Huanyu’s corners, making him look grotesque, but the moon-obsessed eye showed no rejection, merging seamlessly with Yang Huanyu.

“Is this even possible?” Everyone stared at Yang Huanyu, who had merged with Mocheng’s moon-obsessed eye.

“Continue!” Yang Huanyu chuckled, gripping the Black Ghost Halberd and rushing toward Luo Tian again.

Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, the Dragon Origin Sword fully drawn. A torrent of demonic aura surged, its sharpness merging with Luo Tian as he slashed down the Sky-Opening Sword.

Collision sounds echoed again in the sky, Yang Huanyu now able to detect Luo Tian’s attack weaknesses with the moon-obsessed eye.

Luo Tian, having fought Yang Huanyu multiple times, understood him well. The Dragon Origin Sword’s power also gave Luo Tian an edge.

They clashed repeatedly in the sky, leaving their group awestruck.

“Evenly matched!” Wang Gang’s group felt excitement as the Dragon Origin Sword repeatedly struck Yang Huanyu, forcing him back.

“Let’s fight too!” Wang Gang spoke, raising his sword toward the dry corpse army. The Rebirth Hall disciples also gained morale, fighting under Wang Gang’s lead as the ghost soldiers were continuously slain.

Time passed slowly; Yang Huanyu spat blood, his body flying back, frowning as he gazed at Luo Tian, who had been thrown out by the Dragon Origin Sword.

“You give me a familiar feeling!” Yang Huanyu spoke softly, staring at Luo Tian. Having clashed over ninety times, Yang Huanyu, who was no fool, could sense this person bore Luo Tian’s shadow.

“End it!” Luo Tian saw Yang Huanyu’s gaze and knew he had guessed his identity.

“Boom…” His body churned with ghostly energy, pouring into the Rebirth Array. With a thunderous roar, the massive Rebirth Array soared again, hovering above Luo Tian’s head and pressing toward Yang Huanyu.

The pressure was overwhelming; Luo Tian’s face paled, his immortal power half-drained into the Rebirth Array.

“Soul Severance!” Yang Huanyu’s eyes flashed with determination, hand signs swirling before him. A black long sword emerged from the void, radiating supreme authority and appearing in everyone’s sight.

The black coffin Yang Huanyu had previously launched already felt oppressive, but this black sword was even more formidable. Its arrival caused the heavens to tremble.

In an instant, the black sword descended, slicing the Rebirth Array with a deafening roar.

The powerful explosion sound rendered everyone momentarily deaf, their minds blank, eyes dizzy.

Boom boom boom…

Each dry corpse was shattered by this explosion, and the flowing Rebirth Array collapsed. Disciples of the Rebirth Hall flew out from the array, falling pitifully to the ground.

“Cough cough…” Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu both spat blood, their eyes locking.

“Luo family, Luo Chen? Also a surname Luo!” Yang Huanyu’s eyes gleamed with light, gazing at Luo Tian, equally battered.

“Back then there was also a surname Luo who made me so battered. You two are really alike!” Yang Huanyu’s eyes showed a playful glint toward Luo Tian.

“Recognized?” Luo Tian felt a chill, then his eyes turned ruthless. He pointed his finger, sending a beam of divine light.

A scorching atmosphere surged outward, sweeping all around like a blazing sun, illuminating the entire battlefield.

A yellow mirror appeared in the heavens, reflecting all directions. A powerful pressure enveloped everyone.

The eight-corner mirror, forged like copper, echoed waves of sound within it, radiating extreme purification energy that swept across the world.

“Sinful Obstacle Mirror!” Seeing the eight-corner mirror in the sky, everyone’s faces changed, eyes filled with shock.

“The Rebirth Hall’s ancestral treasure!” Yang Huanyu’s expression finally changed. If a Rebirth Array was not enough to fear, the Sinful Obstacle Mirror’s power surpassed it.

“Buzz…” The power swept across, beams of light sweeping the world. The dry corpses let out painful roars, their bodies emitting black smoke and vanishing in the extreme light.

“Go…” Luo Tian pointed his finger, the Sinful Obstacle Mirror emitting a buzz and flying toward Yang Huanyu.

Chapter 2166: No Good People Before the Sinful Obstacle Mirror ()

Daytime, the previously black sky turned as bright as day. Everyone stared at the eight-corner copper mirror in the heavens, including Luo Tian who had brought it to the Rebirth Realm.

When Luo Tian poured all his immortal power into the Sinful Obstacle Mirror, it no longer obeyed him.

Brilliant light spread across the six directions, enveloping the entire world. The yellow light seemed gentle but made everyone uncomfortable, especially the dry corpses fused with ghost soldiers.

Each corpse emitted black smoke, their bodies eroding under the light and vanishing from sight.

The entire sky seemed to become a mirror, reflecting the Rebirth Realm’s scene. Suddenly, cries of anguish echoed; all魂修 in the Northern and Southern tribes showed painful expressions.

This light seemed to cleanse sins, as if the purest light in the world. For ghost cultivators, it was uncomfortable.

Yang Huanyu’s body emitted black smoke, his eyes flashing pain as he gazed at the yellow copper mirror and saw himself in it.

“Die!” Yang Huanyu roared, his body radiating madness, continuously punching as the heavens trembled. Yet it did not harm the Sinful Obstacle Mirror at all.

“Huff…” Luo Tian also panted, seeing his reflection in the mirror. He saw a sea of corpses, his eyes wide open, seeing countless冤魂 behind him. Faces of people appeared in Luo Tian’s mind—those he had killed before.

Luo Tian looked at his hands, the thick blood scent reaching his nose. The surroundings were cold, as if submerged in icy blood.

How many people had he killed? Luo Tian himself didn’t know, couldn’t count. In every war across the nine regions, he had killed many. Entering the Immortal Realm was no different.

“Murderer, I am a murderer!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed regret, his voice trembling.

Wang Gang, Su Dan, Mocheng and others also looked confused, gazing at their reflections in the mirror—another version of themselves, each moment of killing.

“Luo Tian, give me back my life! You murderer, what right do you have to live!” A cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

These voices were familiar yet strange. Luo Tian couldn’t distinguish who they belonged to. He could only recall a few, like Li Xiuping, Feng Jiutian, and Ming Hun...

“Go away…” Luo Tian also fell into madness, continuously attacking the spirits surrounding him.

Everyone in the Rebirth Realm fell into madness, trapped in an illusion, attacking wildly.

The entire Rebirth Realm became chaotic, but no one suffered real harm; they were trapped in their own world.

Time passed slowly. After a month, people finally collapsed from exhaustion and fell into unconsciousness. Only two remained, continuously swinging their fists—Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu.

Another half-month passed before they finally awoke, their eyes clear but confused as they gazed around.

“My cultivation…” People awoke and found their cultivation empty, bodies sore, dan tian devoid of ghost energy or immortal power.

“It must be the Sinful Obstacle Mirror!” Wang Gang exclaimed, his voice not showing any despair but joy.

“Sinful Obstacle Mirror has no good people. Though our cultivation was cleansed, once we leave the Rebirth Realm, my cultivation will recover stronger and my Dao heart more resolute!” Mocheng spoke with a hint of joy.

“Though it’s good, I don’t want to experience this again!” Su Dan looked at the eight-corner mirror with trepidation but immediately stopped watching, fearing to fall into that terrifying memory.

“They’re still not out!” People saw Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu still shouting wildly.

“I’m going to kill those I’ve killed before again, to prove my Dao heart and escape this strange state. Finally, I collapsed from exhaustion!”

“How many people did they kill? They’re still trapped in this state?” People gasped, watching Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu.

“That guy isn’t a good person; killing many is one thing, but how did Luo Tian end up here? He was always in the Luo family. According to logic, he should have already escaped!” People’s eyes showed shock as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“Now is the best time to kill that guy, but our cultivation is gone. In this Sinful Obstacle Mirror, we can’t recover!” Mocheng’s face was grim. He had only one right eye now; the left remained empty, and without retrieving his eyes, even after leaving the Rebirth Realm, he would permanently lose his left eye.

“Kill kill kill…” Luo Tian’s world was filled with continuous attacks, each spirit killed by his hands.

But the spirits were too many; even with his strength, he couldn’t kill them all instantly. Moreover, his soul-binding technique was powerless.

The most painful thing for Luo Tian was that many of these spirits were mistakenly killed; after all, death in war was common.

This made Luo Tian feel guilt and reluctance to completely annihilate these dead people.

“Who is that person? Such strength, even in other halls would be famous. Why have we never heard of him?” Wang Gang and others sat up slowly, observing Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu to guess Yang Huanyu’s identity.

“Never seen him. If I knew, I’d have my father kill this dog!”

“Also, how did he enter the Rebirth Pool?” People were puzzled, unsure of Yang Huanyu’s identity.

Another seven days passed; Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu continued, while Wang Gang’s group waited helplessly. The Sinful Obstacle Mirror still hovered above the sky, preventing them from regaining cultivation.

The Rebirth Realm became cleaner with the Sinful Obstacle Mirror’s appearance, air no longer cold. The魂修 of Northern and Southern tribes vanished completely, as if cleansed.

“These two won’t end!” The group sighed helplessly, watching them still wildly swinging fists but with slower movements—evidently about to collapse.

“Who am I?” Luo Tian gazed at the endless spirits, finally losing himself, exhausted and at his limit.

“Give me back my life…” The spirits roared again, seeing Luo Tian’s hesitation and rushing toward him.

But Luo Tian’s soul was still strong; even as the spirits tore at him, they couldn’t move him. They only made him numb.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian was confused, imprints rose from his soul’s third eye, gradually clearing his vision.

“Boom…” Memories surged into Luo Tian’s mind like a spring.

A gray figure appeared in Luo Tian’s vision, an old man with hands constantly moving, imprints flowing from his hands.

“Ksitigarbha’s Seal!” Luo Tian’s gray eyes gleamed with clarity, his hands moving in tandem.

The sound of explosions echoed; as Luo Tian’s hands moved, the surrounding spirits let out screams and disintegrated before his eyes.

“Supernatural Seal?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed understanding, as a chant of Buddhist sutras echoed in his mind. He now understood the origin of Ksitigarbha.

“Ksitigarbha, a former Buddha sect powerhouse who offended the Buddha Sect’s elders and was thrown into hell, becoming Ksitigarbha?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed confusion.

Luo Tian had absorbed a Buddha sect relic before, so he knew the Buddha Sect was powerful in the Immortal Realm, one of the nine immortal mountains.

The technique he had just used was the Buddha Sect’s Supernatural Seal, specifically for purifying spirits. These spirits were exactly what triggered the imprints in Luo Tian’s body—the imprint that had fallen into his body when Ksitigarbha’s palace collapsed.

With the imprints appearing, Luo Tian had obtained part of Ksitigarbha’s inheritance. Though it was just a technique, the Supernatural Seal was an ultimate skill of the Buddha Sect, specifically for subduing enemy souls.

“Unexpectedly, Ksitigarbha’s inheritance fell into my hands…” Luo Tian whispered to himself. As he spoke, a powerful pressure radiated from his hands, forming a gray seal in his palm.

“Subdue!” Luo Tian roared, the gray seal sweeping across and emitting strange fluctuations, instantly subduing the spirits.

“Forgive me; I had to do this. Blame them for being my enemies!” Luo Tian whispered, and his soul returned to his body, stopping his wild punches. He collapsed onto the ground.

As Luo Tian fell, Yang Huanyu also collapsed on the ground with a sneer.

“They finally fell!” Seeing Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu collapse, Wang Gang’s group sighed deeply, gazing at them.

Seven days later, both Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu awoke simultaneously, exchanging glances. Yang Huanyu’s eyes showed a smile.

Chapter 2168: Misunderstanding ()

A massive body appeared in the sky. The ghost turtle roared, flying toward Fu Xingxuan’s front.

Fu Xingxuan gazed at Luo Tian deeply, making Luo Tian shiver; that gaze was too lethal.

“Little brother Luo Chen, why are you trembling?” Su Dan’s sultry voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, making him shiver.

“Nothing, just a little cold after returning…” Luo Tian chuckled nervously, trying to push Su Dan away.

“Why? You’re already turning on me? Forgot the happy times inside? Men are indeed heartless…” Su Dan smiled, puckering her lips, her words evoking imagination.

“Monster! Monster…” At this moment, Luo Tian became the focus of attention. Su Dan’s words were clearly heard, and people’s eyes flashed with envy, some disciples cursing inwardly.

“Ten years; although it was ten days here, it was ten years in the Rebirth Hall. During these ten years, I guess you two did everything…” People’s eyes flashed with jealousy.

Luo Tian’s forehead sweat flowed, feeling a knife at his neck. He secretly glanced at Fu Xingxuan and found him watching him.

“Everyone, I’ll go back first!”

“Please return the Rebirth Array to me!” Fu Xingxuan coldly glanced at Luo Tian, then addressed Du Jianhang and others.

“Okay… okay…” Luo Tian spoke, waving his hand to return the Rebirth Array to Fu Xingxuan’s hands. A beam of divine light rose from Luo Tian’s third eye, disappearing from people’s sight.

“Roar…” Fu Xingxuan retrieved the Rebirth Array, standing on the ghost turtle’s massive body. The turtle roared and flew toward the Rebirth Hall.

“Luo Xiong, we’ll go back first! Take care and rest well…” Wang Gang laughed, addressing Luo Tian to ease the tension.

“Brother… Luo Xiong…” As Wang Gang’s words faded, a voice echoed from the crowd. Eyes filled with excitement, gazing at Luo Tian standing there.

“Wang Lie!” Luo Tian’s face showed surprise, not expecting Wang Lie to arrive at the Rebirth Hall so quickly.

In fact, Wang Lie had arrived yesterday but was distracted by Fu Xingxuan’s trance. Luo Tian had previously emerged and stunned Wang Lie with his strength and status, never expecting him to become a Holy Son in the Rebirth Hall so quickly.

Moreover, Yu Tian had been beaten by him, and even the deputy hall masters had voluntarily brought Yu Tian to Luo Tian.

“Haha, brother, let’s go to my place; I’ll treat you!” Luo Tian’s eyes brightened, rushing toward Wang Lie with great enthusiasm.

“Uh… okay…” Wang Lie nodded and was pulled by Luo Tian toward the Rebirth Hall.

“Everyone, I’ll treat you… come if you want!” Luo Tian laughed, addressing Wang Gang and Mocheng. He pulled Wang Lie away like running from a fight.

“…” People were speechless, watching Luo Tian pull Wang Lie, who was embarrassed, away.

“Damn it, that kid is my brother! Why does it sound like you’re brothers!” Wang Gang shouted, chasing after Luo Tian.

“Haha, I’ll go for a drink too!” Qiu Long laughed and followed the group.

Mocheng and others also stood up, flying toward the Rebirth Hall.

“Alright, everyone go back. The Rebirth Pool has ended completely!” Du Jianhang spoke with a smile.

The副 hall masters’ faces were not good, especially Yu Tian, who had truly embarrassed himself today by being slapped in front of everyone.

This incident would become a laughingstock for the Rebirth Hall, even spreading that Luo Tian had established his name.

People dispersed, and the Rebirth Hall returned to normal. Soon after, several figures flew out of the hall, each radiating powerful energy. The weakest was at the peak of Immortal, with ten half-step Immortal Kings dividing into ten directions to search for Yang Huanyu.

The Rebirth Hall trembled, causing the entire hell to quake. Almost everyone knew that a new figure had appeared in hell—entering the Rebirth Realm during the pool’s opening with special methods, nearly slaughtering all Rebirth Hall disciples and even eight minor heavenly kings.

If it weren’t for the new Holy Son, carrying the Rebirth Array and Sinful Obstacle Mirror—two ultimate treasures—into the Rebirth Realm, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

Two names spread throughout hell: Yang Huanyu and the new Holy Son of the Rebirth Hall, Luo Chen.

Everyone speculated who Yang Huanyu was, daring to insult the Rebirth Hall. If he had no backing, who would dare?

People soon turned their eyes to the Yama Ten Halls. The Yama Ten Halls had friction, and such an act was likely possible.

In the thirty-third level courtyard of the Rebirth Hall, Luo Tian’s residence was lively. A young man wore a look of annoyance.

“Sigh, I missed the Rebirth Pool by days!” Wang Lie spoke loudly, his voice filled with regret. He had reached the peak of Immortal in the Beast Ghost King City, aided by the Beast Ghost King. If he had entered the Rebirth Pool, he might have reached the Late-stage Immortal.

One step behind, all steps behind—unless with a great opportunity, it was hard for Wang Lie to catch up.

“Cultivate well in the Rebirth Hall. The thirty-third level has dense ghost energy, and you’ll progress quickly!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing Wang Lie.

“Brother, you really are fierce! I never expected to become a Holy Son so quickly after arriving at the Rebirth Hall. I rarely admire people, but you truly have my respect!”
