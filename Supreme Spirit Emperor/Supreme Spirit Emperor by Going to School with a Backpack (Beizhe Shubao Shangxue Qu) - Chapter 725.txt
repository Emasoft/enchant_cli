“Yin Wu, you bastard, why bring him here? I was almost successful!” Fan Tianyin fell into the pool, struck by countless divine thunderbolts, spitting blood from his mouth. Yet he struggled toward the seven-colored thunderflower.

Fan Tianyin excelled in body cultivation, and in the Thunder Sea Marsh had enhanced his strength significantly. Even amidst the thunderous pool, he hadn’t been slain—only slightly injured. Fan Tianyin cursed Yin Wu, recalling how he had plummeted into this pool before, nearly torn apart. But Fan Tianyin endured and crawled out.

Fate! When Fan Tianyin saw the seven-colored thunderflower in the pool, he knew it was his great fortune. Thus, he aimed to seize it, standing by the pool’s edge for days, observing its patterns. He discovered that every three days, the thunderpower in the pool weakened. If he rushed through then, he could claim the flower.

Yet another day would bring the next weak point. Fan Tianyin hadn’t expected Yin Wu to arrive with Luo Tian, this blight.

“Good thing!” Yin Wu’s eyes narrowed; without hesitation, he stepped into the thunderpool. As soon as he entered, several thunderbolts struck him.

“Ah…” Yin Wu screamed. He had already suffered heavy wounds, and now the thunderbolts worsened his injuries.

Furious thunder coursed through Yin Wu’s wounds, searing into his body. He trembled violently.

“Nascent Soul Shield!” Yin Wu gritted his teeth, unable to resist the flower’s allure. He withdrew a shield. The ancient artifact bore intricate patterns, unmistakably not an ordinary item. Its surface radiated worldpower.

Boom! Boom! Thunderbolts struck the shield, rebounding violently but leaving Yin Wu unscathed. He advanced swiftly, even overtaking Fan Tianyin.

“World Treasure?” Luo Tian and Fan Tianyin’s eyes narrowed upon seeing the shield.

“No, it’s not a World Treasure,” they realized. If it were, those thunderbolts might have been subdued.

“It’s the World Heart evolved—though not fully. Though it pales compared to a true World Treasure, it surpasses even the rarest divine weapons. It may take ages to fully evolve into a World Treasure.”

“If it does, its power will be unparalleled.”

“This must be Yin Wu’s life-saving artifact from the Wuhua Sect!” Fan Tianyin’s eyes flickered, recognizing the shield.

“Interesting,” Luo Tian’s gaze softened with amusement. His eyes flashed with thunder patterns as he leapt into the pool.

“Make way!” Luo Tian roared, his aura expanding to control the incoming thunderbolts. Waves rippled outward; his Golden Wheel Thunder Eye was formidable, but the pool’s thunderpower far exceeded that outside. Though he subdued some bolts, many still struck him, numbing his body.

Not enough! Luo Tian growled, his eyes blazing with gold. The thunder patterns in his eyes spun rapidly, and the incoming thunderbolts halted before him.

“Move…” Seeing this, Luo Tian strode toward the flower with steady steps, quickly overtaking Yin Wu.

“Damn it! I forgot he could briefly control thunder! This pool can’t harm him!” Yin Wu’s heart raced, frustration mounting. Yet he had the Nascent Soul Shield but still lagged behind Luo Tian.

Fan Tianyin fared even worse, his speed slower than Yin Wu’s.

“Nine Transformations of the Shadow Soul!” Fan Tianyin roared, his aura exploding. His body radiated explosive power as thunderbolts battered him relentlessly.

Yet even with the Nine Transformations, Luo Tian overtook him. At that moment, they were merely tens of zhang apart, with the flower only hundreds of zhang away.

“I’ll take it first!” Luo Tian addressed Fan Tianyin without striking. The priority was securing the flower.

Fan Tianyin seethed but could only watch Luo Tian draw closer, the flower’s distance shrinking.

Five hundred zhang… four hundred zhang… Luo Tian neared the flower, and it trembled, as if aware of its fate. It slowly ascended.

“Trying to flee?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, sensing the flower’s intent. As it rose, millions of thunderbolts surged forth.

“This pool’s thunder is all roots of this flower!” Luo Tian instantly understood, his eyes wide with horror.

As he neared, the thunder became harder to control.

Crash! As Luo Tian stood three hundred zhang from the flower, its seven petals erupted with thunder in seven colors. They coalesced above the flower, forming seven humanoid figures, each wielding a thunder spear.

“Is this thing sentient?” Yin Wu and Fan Tianyin’s hair stood on end. These were human-shaped lightning, akin to heavenly tribulations—yet their faces were discernible, far more terrifying than ordinary tribulations.

Luo Tian also paused, sensing an intense threat from the seven thunderforms. He withdrew his Rupture Spear, watching them closely.

Chapter 2748: Fortune()

In the thunderpool, seven thunderforms stood with spears, their lightning-formed gazes fixed on Luo Tian. One step closer, and they would unleash fury.

“Master, these seven cannot be measured by strength. If I’m not mistaken, this flower is the Seven-Colored Thunder Cloud Flower!”

As Luo Tian pondered, a weak voice echoed in his mind. His face lit up with joy.

The speaker was the Patching Heaven Stone, dormant since the battle at Tianyuan Sect where it had held off a peak Immortal King. Though silent, Luo Tian knew it still resided within him.

“The Seven-Colored Thunder Cloud Flower is rare even in ancient times. To form it requires time and opportunity—otherwise, it’s nearly impossible. I recall an ancient Thunder King who possessed a six-colored one!”

“This item is beyond the reach of even a World-level powerhouse!” The Patching Heaven Stone added, stirring Luo Tian’s thoughts.

“How much has your memory recovered?” Luo Tian asked, more concerned about the stone’s current state.

“Some has returned, but most remains lost—perhaps memories were forcibly erased. That’s why I survived!”

“Maoque faced the same fate. Any ancient entities appearing now must share our plight.” Maoque responded, prompting Luo Tian to sigh inwardly.

“How do I collect it?” Luo Tian pressed on; securing the flower was urgent.

“Hold them off for a moment—I’ll explain everything in one heartbeat!” The stone’s voice carried greed, making Luo Tian suspect it might hoard the prize.

“Fine, if you try to take it all, I’ll skin you!” Luo Tian roared, brandishing his spear and charging at the seven thunderforms.

Seeing him approach, the forms showed no emotion, rushing forward with spears to surround Luo Tian.

Spear like a dragon, Luo Tian thrust his spear at a purple lightning figure. The latter retaliated with a spear strike.

Crack! A thunderous clash erupted, violet electricity surging through the spear, striking Luo Tian. He trembled, nearly dropping his weapon.

“Get out of the way!” Six forms attacked Luo Tian, who barked as his eyes’ thunder patterns spun rapidly.

His aura expanded; the six spears seemed seized by an invisible hand, veering to pierce Luo Tian’s surroundings. Though he deflected one wave, his eyes ached immensely from the strain.

“Hurry! I can’t last long!” Luo Tian communicated with the stone, resuming combat against the seven forms.

The thunderpool trembled as Luo Tian clashed with the seven, its wild energy shaking the land. Yin Wu and Fan Tianyin were awestruck.

“This is too变态!” They marveled, watching Luo Tian. Both felt the forms’ might.

“He’s drawing their attention—we can seize the flower now!” They exchanged silent thoughts, forming an alliance. Luo Tian was the true threat; they hadn’t planned to kill him but aimed to claim the flower, knowing he was hard to slay.

They leapt toward the seven-colored thundercloud flower, now at 100 zhang.

Yet as Luo Tian retreated under the seven forms’ assault, Yin Wu and Fan Tianyin charged. But their joyous faces froze—four of the forms split off, charging them with overwhelming power.

“This isn’t how it was scripted!” They mentally screamed, but the four forms moved too fast, locking onto them. Three spears shot in different directions, forcing them to defend.

“Earthly Demons’ Thirty-Six!”
“Wuhua Slash!” Fan Tianyin and Yin Wu had no choice but to face the four forms, enduring countless thunderbolts.

“Thanks!”
“This time, I won’t kill you!” Luo Tian shouted, sweeping aside three spears.

Luo Tian panted heavily, catching his breath as he glanced at the flower. It had risen to 200 zhang but seemed restrained, frozen in place. Luo Tian saw a red dot above it—Patching Heaven Stone.

“Now it’s easier!” Luo Tian observed the three remaining forms, his魔云翅 (Demon Cloud Wings) flaring. He unleashed a piercing spear strike, driving it into a form’s heart. Thunder scattered from the form.

“Sixth轮回!” Luo Tian turned, six whirlwinds forming on his fists. He hurled a punch at a green lightning form.

Boom! The green form was crushed, its body pierced by Luo Tian’s fist. The six whirlwinds began eroding the form.

A third black lightning spear struck Luo Tian’s back, sending him crashing. After this round, two forms appeared fainter, especially the one hit by the six whirlwinds—its power was eroded threefold.

“Again!” Luo Tian charged the three forms, now more composed and able to suppress them.

In contrast, Yin Wu and Fan Tianyin fared worse—each faced two forms, not killing them but leaving them in chaos. Time passed; their resolve wavered, regretting their greed. If not for it, Luo Tian might have been severely wounded by the seven forms.

One heartbeat passed; Luo Tian grew lighter, his foes now nearly intangible.

“Done!” The stone’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, signaling him to stop. He gazed at the seven-colored thundercloud flower.

Chapter 2750: Descendants of the Nine Realms()

“Haha!”
Half a month later, laughter echoed through the ruined thunderpool. The sound carried excitement, and a tremor spread across the realm.

Heavens shuddered; the sky roared as the tremor spread, halting all thunder in the Thunder Sea Marsh.

“How is this possible?” The stone’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, stunned.

At that moment, space twisted above Luo Tian’s palm, thunderous roars resounding—yet no visible lightning.

“Call this technique ‘Palm of Thunder’!” Luo Tian pushed his palm forward, sending the distorted void outward. The invisible wave pierced the barrier, vanishing from view.

One breath… two…
Time passed slowly as Luo Tian stood within the barrier, unable to see beyond. Yet he had no doubt about the palm’s power.

Boom!
After several breaths, thunderous explosions erupted in the Thunder Sea Marsh, shaking the land. Powerful lightning was annihilated, vanishing from Luo Tian’s sight.

The area within several zhang became a vacuum of ruins. Luo Tian surveyed the wasteland, satisfaction on his face.

“Patching Heaven Stone, you bastard! If these seven thunderforms merged, what power would they wield? They could obliterate an Immortal King peak!” Luo Tian cursed.

“Master, don’t rush. This thundercloud flower will recover,” the stone replied,懊恼 (disappointed) at Luo Tian’s success.

“Let’s go. We’ve wasted too much time here,” Luo Tian said softly, needing to meet Diao Dezhu and Yao Chen. The dangers here were too great; early reunion was essential.

Luo Tian took a pill, his wounds from the explosions healing gradually. The surrounding thunder now circled him harmlessly, even aiding him. In this Thunder Sea Marsh, he was invincible.

Time passed slowly; after an hour, Luo Tian finally exited the Thunder Sea Marsh, exhaling deeply.

Black earth appeared before him, as if scorched. Luo Tian walked across it, the thunderous sounds fading.

“What place is this?” He gazed at the vast land, even with his Golden Wheel Thunder Eye, he couldn’t see through.

Black mist rose gradually, obscuring his vision. The mist exuded an eerie aura, making Luo Tian’s heart tighten.

“Where are Yin Wu and Fan Tianyin?” Luo Tian wondered, his footsteps making a rustling sound. Occasionally, black ash rose.

Luo Tian quickened his pace; the mist thickened, a cold chill spreading across the land.

“Here?” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed, sensing a familiar aura. He stopped, activating his Thunder Eye.

“Coffin!” His vision improved, revealing many scenes. The most striking was a massive coffin.

Upon seeing it, Luo Tian knew where he was—the reversal zone of the Thunder Domain, Yin City.

The coffin before him was the ancient Burial Immortal Coffin!

“Back then, we felt it was powerful but dared not touch. Even after the Nine Realms collided with the Immortal Realm, it still remained!” Luo Tian murmured, intending to inspect the coffin. After all, he was no longer the weak Luo Tian of before; his strength now rivaled even the Immortal Realm.

Luo Tian stepped forward toward the coffin, his vision clarifying as he walked. He saw several figures standing beneath it.

Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, sensing no immediate danger from the mist. He sped up, leaping toward the Burial Immortal Coffin.

……
Outside the black coffin stood several figures, their faces arrogant. Beside them were over a dozen people, their expressions grim and ragged.

“Lice! You’re lice!” A youth spoke, voice dripping with contempt as he gazed at the ragged figures. He was the Saint Son of East Palace.

“Who are you? What do you want?” A middle-aged man among the dozen asked, eyes on the youths.

“We are your gods. No matter how powerful you were in this small world, your days of glory end today!” A senior spoke, Master Sikong Xing of Eternal Life Sect.

Sikong Xing’s side held several Saint Sons: Gui Ming of Ghost King Sect, the new East Palace Saint Son, and Hunxuan of Broken Soul Sect.

As Sikong Xing gestured, several seals were etched into the dozen’s bodies. They screamed in agony.

Buzz…
A wave rose; each of their foreheads bore an imprint—the奴役印 (Slave Mark).

“From now on, you are my Eternal Life Sect’s slaves. You will serve only us for generations!” Sikong Xing declared.

Others didn’t intervene; these were mere low-level beings, easily crushed with a thought.

“Yet you will be honored to serve us. Many in the Immortal Realm desire this!” Sikong Xing continued, making the dozen’s faces pale with shock.

“Immortal Realm!” A middle-aged man spoke, eyes wide as he gazed at Sikong Xing. They had lived in the Nine Realms, being top-tier powerhouses there. Yet these figures’ auras alone could crush them.

“Come, let me search your soul!” Sikong Xing raised his hand, seizing the lead middle-aged man. He gripped the man’s throat.

“Ah…” The man screamed, golden light radiating from his body. A dragon’s roar echoed before Sikong Xing, catching his attention and drawing others’ gazes.

“Dragon!” They gasped, staring at the golden dragon now transformed but still clutched by Sikong Xing.

Golden blood rained down, the dragon thrashing violently, scales falling in clumps.

“Be still!” Sikong Xing’s eyes glowed; he felt the dragon’s blood was rich. He tightened his grip, causing the dragon to emit a crackling sound as it was slammed onto the ground.

“Unexpected gain! Come with me to the Immortal Realm and be my steed!” Sikong Xing spoke softly.

Chapter 2751: Beast of凶兽()
“Profit!” Gui Ming’s eyes gleamed; he hadn’t expected a small world to hold a dragon.

“Master Sikong, I want two of them!” Gui Ming spoke, eyeing the remaining people. He grabbed a strong man and a youth, bringing them to his side.

“I want some too!” Others spoke in turn, dividing the dozen like a meal. Each had two or three captives beside them.

Sikong Xing didn’t stop them; he felt the dragon’s blood was strongest among these dozen.

“Unbelievable, I didn’t expect these beasts to have such strong bloodlines!” Their faces showed satisfaction.

……
As they spoke, a youth beside East Palace Saint Son exploded into blood mist.

“Trash! You’re wasting food!” The East Palace Saint Son sneered, eyes unimpressed.

“Xiao Er!” Seeing the youth’s explosion, the strong man whose soul was captured by Gui Ming turned red with rage, roaring.

But it was futile; before Sikong Xing’s group, they had no chance to even self-destruct.

“Roar…” Others also roared, their bodies transforming into fierce beasts with red eyes.

“Be quiet!” Sikong Xing and others barked, their auras spreading to make the beasts collapse.

“Trash has no right to exist. You’re even less than trash in our eyes!” A Saint Son spoke, slaying a beast with weaker bloodline.

……
With each strike, they killed several beasts, their blood staining the ground. They gestured, and the beast corpses flew toward the Burial Immortal Coffin.

Strangely, the corpses didn’t fall but clung to the massive coffin as if glued. Their blood seemed drained completely.

The remaining beasts roared, emitting piercing cries that echoed across the land.

“You have only one path: submit!” Sikong Xing, standing on the golden dragon, addressed the beasts.

“Ferocity is hard to tame. No problem; I’ll have time to train you after we leave!” Sikong Xing reached for the dragon on the ground.

……
As Sikong Xing bent down, a piercing sound echoed. A black spear sliced through space, appearing behind him instantly.

Crash!
The black spear shimmered with three-colored lightning, striking Sikong Xing’s back. A furious killing intent swept the land, making the Immortal Realm figures shiver.

Sikong Xing’s face changed; green energy surged, forming a shield before him. He spun around instantly.

Crack!
The shield shattered within a breath, barely blocking the spear. The spear pierced through, striking Sikong Xing’s shoulder.

Powerful force sent him stumbling back; his eyes held terror as he gazed into the black mist.

A figure burst from the mist, surrounded by three lightning rings, becoming a blur as it rushed toward Sikong Xing.

“Who!” Gui Ming and others were shocked; the intruder’s speed surpassed all of them. Even they felt a blur in their vision.

Eight fists appeared, a figure cloaked in demonic aura materializing before them. The fist struck Sikong Xing, who had just been carried by the spear.

“Get out!” Sikong Xing’s mind trembled; only a towering fist was before him. He had no time to think, striking back with a punch.

Crack!
Sikong Xing’s entire arm cracked inch by inch, as if struck by an invisible force.

“Ah!” Sikong Xing screamed, his body flying backward and colliding with the Burial Immortal Coffin. Blood stained the coffin, his face contorted in terror as he felt a suction force pulling him, draining his blood and cultivation into the coffin.

Sikong Xing roared, his cultivation surging violently. Thunderous sounds echoed repeatedly as he struggled to escape the coffin, barely managing it. His eyes held fear, sensing the coffin’s terrifying power.

“Die!” As Sikong Xing trembled in fear, a cold voice echoed in his ears. The fists converged on him.

……
A dull sound rang out; Sikong Xing had just escaped the coffin but was struck again by Luo Tian’s punch. His body flew back, colliding with the coffin once more.

Spurt! Blood gushed from Sikong Xing’s mouth. A wild wave surged from the coffin, as if provoked, absorbing his blood and cultivation fiercely.

In people’s terrified gazes, Sikong Xing’s body shrank rapidly, eventually turning into a dry corpse that fell from the coffin.

“Luo Tian!” Gui Ming and others’ faces showed disbelief as they gazed at Luo Tian, shouting his name.

“He’s grown stronger!” Gui Ming’s face darkened; they had gained some cultivation within, but Luo Tian had also strengthened.

“Luo Tian!” The beasts captured by the Immortal Realm also showed disbelief, their eyes wide.

“How is this possible!” The golden dragon on the ground gasped, staring at Luo Tian standing beside him.

“Master Dragon, I’m sorry I was late!” Luo Tian’s eyes held guilt; this golden dragon was the father of Long Jie, Long Jian.

The beasts were also fierce creatures from Dian Forest, old companions of Luo Tian. When he was weak, they had helped him greatly.

Luo Tian felt Long Jian’s severe injuries—nearly death, but not for an Immortal King. For a Dragon of the Heavenly Path, it was almost fatal.

Luo Tian extended his worldpower over Long Jian, restoring him to human form beside himself.

“Luo Tian, what happened? We were suddenly hit by a violent impact in the Thunder Sea Marsh and passed out. When we woke up, they had captured us!” Long Jian spoke, even he was confused about what happened. Why had Luo Tian suddenly appeared?

“Later, I’ll kill them!” Luo Tian raised a red stone above Long Jian’s head.

“If he has any issues, I’ll kill you!” Luo Tian addressed the stone while gazing at Gui Ming: “You’ve crossed my line!”

Chapter 2752: Choice()
Luo Tian stood there, his wounds healed. Though his cultivation was restricted to Immortal King Mid-Stage, it still pressed heavily on Gui Ming and others.

The Immortal Realm had sent few people; one, Bai Yao, was already killed by Luo Tian. Another, Sikong Xing, had just been slain.

No one from Mount Mihu or Peach Pool was present; even if they were, they wouldn’t help. At this moment, the Immortal Realm had only four people: Gui Ming, East Palace Saint Son, Hunxuan of Broken Soul Sect, and a man from the Fallen Heaven Sect who had taken over the Central Three Realms. This man was an Immortal King Mid-Stage, clearly weaker than Gui Ming and others.

Luo Tian was alone but made Gui Ming and the others feel extremely uneasy. This person seemed different from them.

“Kill!” As they were stunned, a cold voice echoed. Luo Tian stepped forward, vanishing from his spot.

Gui Ming’s face twisted; he rapidly formed Dao seals on his body. The seals had just appeared when Luo Tian’s Rupture Spear struck him in the back.

But Gui Ming didn’t dodge, instead striking Luo Tian’s head with a fist.

“Luo Tian, you’ve insulted us too much!” Gui Ming’s voice echoed; his heart area was empty, as if it had vanished.

“Hmm?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed; he hadn’t expected Gui Ming to have this trick. He stopped instantly, retreating but still too slow. The ghostly fist struck his head, though he had partially deflected it with his retreat.

“Luo Tian, you’ve treated the Immortal Realm as a soft target!” The man from Fallen Heaven Sect spoke loudly, anger in his voice. Seeing Luo Tian’s head had a crack, he knew Luo Tian was severely injured and aimed to kill him while he was weak.

The man’s name was Bai Zhi Chang, younger brother of Bai Zhi. His strength ranked second to Bai Zhi but he had always resented his brother’s authority, so he volunteered for this mission to prove himself.

Throughout the journey, Bai Zhi Chang had been treated poorly by others, not as badly as before with Zhou Zhiwen but still no better. He had been angry all along, wanting to prove he was no worse than Bai Zhi or any of the Saint Sons. The best way to do this was to kill Luo Tian, making him famous across the Immortal Realm and even Hell. After all, Luo Tian had become an insurmountable mountain among the young generation of both realms.

In a flash, Bai Zhi Chang held a long sword emitting an icy glow. He unleashed his speed and secret techniques, vanishing from sight to appear before Luo Tian.

One zhang… one cun…
The icy sword’s glow neared Luo Tian, and he saw Bai Zhi Chang’s excited eyes.

“Die!” As Bai Zhi Chang felt he was about to succeed, Luo Tian only spoke one word: “Die!”—which froze Bai Zhi Chang’s sword mid-strike.

Luo Tian’s cold eyes stared at Bai Zhi Chang, making his hair stand on end and body tremble.

Luo Tian grabbed the cold sword with one hand while his other fist swung toward Bai Zhi Chang. Six whirlwinds combined with chaotic punches could kill an average Immortal King Mid-Stage. Though Bai Zhi Chang was strong, he couldn’t withstand Luo Tian’s punch.

Boom!
Six whirlwinds exploded on Bai Zhi Chang, swirling and tearing his body into blood mist before Luo Tian.

Luo Tian was drenched in Bai Zhi Chang’s blood, his gaze turning to the stunned Hunxuan and others.

“Idiots! If Luo Tian were so easy to kill, he’d have died many times!” Gui Ming and Hunxuan mentally cursed, watching Luo Tian.

Bai Zhi Chang was killed by Luo Tian’s punch, wiping out Gui Ming and others’ thoughts of joining forces to kill him. Unless they used their last secret weapon, the World Heart would be lost forever.

“Next!” Luo Tian spoke coldly, his foot stepping forward to target Hunxuan.

“Luo Tian, stop! If you don’t, I’ll kill him!” Hunxuan quickly grabbed two half-dead beasts he had subdued and held them before himself.

Luo Tian halted, recognizing the beasts as Black Tigers from Dian Forest. They were too weak—half-epoch level—and close to Hunxuan. Luo Tian feared attacking Hunxuan might harm the tigers.

“Useful!”
Seeing Luo Tian stop, Hunxuan and Gui Ming’s eyes lit up. They had guessed Luo Tian was angry because he cared for these small-world beings, and it turned out correct.

“Seems he cares,” Hunxuan sighed, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian, we had some past dealings. We have no major grudge. I’ll hand over these two to you; we’ll be enemies no more, okay?” Hunxuan spoke loudly.

“Luo Tian, I’ve lived millions of years and am tired!” The Black Tiger roared at Luo Tian.
Among the beasts killed earlier, one was the Black Tiger’s son. At his age, losing a son made him grieve.

“Did you kill them?” Luo Tian’s eyes turned icy as he asked Hunxuan.

“No!” Hunxuan quickly replied, relieved he hadn’t killed any.

“Release them; you can go!” Luo Tian mused, gazing at Hunxuan.

“Thank you!” Hunxuan bowed to Luo Tian and carefully sent the Black Tiger and another bear to his side.

Luo Tian took them to the Patching Heaven Stone, ignoring Hunxuan as he sighed.

Luo Tian turned his gaze to Gui Ming, eyes flashing coldness: “If you didn’t kill anyone, you can do the same as him!”

“Take it!” Gui Ming raised his hand, sending two beasts to Luo Tian.

“You…” As the two were released, the East Palace Saint Son’s face darkened—because he had killed three beasts.

“Only you remain!” Luo Tian gazed at the East Palace Saint Son, who now had two beasts left. The new Saint Son didn’t know what to do.

Chapter 2753: Seven Stars in a Row()
Luo Tian gazed at the East Palace Saint Son, eyes cold. He didn’t know his name since the previous Saint Son had been killed by him.

“Luo Tian, what are you doing? Don’t come closer; if you do, I’ll kill them!” The East Palace Saint Son roared, watching Luo Tian step toward him.
