“Are you Luo Tian? We’ve chased you so hard!” The youth’s face was cold, his body surrounded by gray mist. His gaze fell upon Luo Tian.

“Go away!” At this moment, Luo Tian no longer cared who the opponent was. If it weren’t for the two Sage Peak masters behind him, and the countless troops of the Mortal Domain converging upon him, he might have fought. But time was critical. His body flashed forward, instantly rushing toward the youth.

As he flew, his Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist surged forth, striking Mingyuan. A thunderous roar echoed from Luo Tian’s body. This punch was his full effort—though he could not kill Mingyuan, he needed to create an escape.

“Powerful! Indeed, the prodigy who stirred chaos in the Nine Domains!” Mingyuan’s face showed a flicker of surprise, his eyes burning with battle lust. Facing Luo Tian’s overwhelming punch, he showed no fear. Gray mist coiled around Mingyuan’s fist, clashing with Luo Tian’s Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist.

*Crack…* The collision of fists sent shockwaves through the starry void, shattering it. Both figures retreated, and Luo Tian’s eyes widened in surprise.

“Damn!” Luo Tian suppressed the churning blood in his body, his face pale for a moment. His eyes flashed with hatred—Mingyuan’s strength had exceeded his expectations.

Though Luo Tian suffered no real injury, Mingyuan blocked his path. To retreat was impossible; he felt the presence of five Sage Peak masters surrounding him from all sides, their paths sealed.

Compared to Luo Tian’s grim expression, Mingyuan’s face was even more shaken. He was one of the Nine Sons of the Mortal Domain, a title that carried immense power. Yet he had suffered a minor setback in their clash—this was unacceptable for someone who regarded others as mere insects.

“You shall be my first target among the Nine Domains’ prodigies!” Mingyuan’s face remained cold. The starry void was shrouded in gray mist as his hands moved swiftly.

“Mourning God’s Sigh!” The gray mist coalesced into a tangible figure, towering like a mountain. Bloodstained energy gathered around its hollow eyes.

“Ah…” A long sigh echoed from the figure, sending a crushing pressure through the void.

*Boom…* A torrent of gray mist erupted from the figure, a wave of destruction sweeping toward Luo Tian.

At the moment the figure manifested, Luo Tian felt its tenacity and grimaced further.

“Must escape! No more delays!” Luo Tian’s mind raced. He drew his Wounding Heaven Bow, entering a demonic state. A black demon arrow凝聚 in his hand.

Two arrows shot forth, piercing through the gray mist. Meanwhile, Luo Tian’s hands moved rapidly, his black demon energy coalescing into a vast Dao Diagram that surged toward the gray figure.

“Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram! Success!” Luo Tian’s face lit with joy. After obtaining the Epoch Book from the Divine Clan, he had studied it in Tongtian Mountain but failed to master it. Yet now, under life-or-death circumstances, he had accidentally mastered the technique.

Though his black demon diagram lacked the full power of a Divine Clan master, it possessed the strength of six continental realms. For Luo Tian, a descendant of Sage Peak, this was no small feat.

*Boom…* The diagram thundered forth, crushing Mingyuan’s figure.

“This is a Divine Clan technique!” Mingyuan’s face paled. The Mortal Domain feared the nine sacred domains most, each with unique techniques.

*Crack…* The void fractured as the black diagram crushed the gray figure, sending a violent shockwave outward.

“Master and that boy have clashed! We must hurry—this boy is no ordinary foe. If Master suffers even a minor injury, we won’t survive!” Five Sage Peak masters felt the shockwave from their clash. Their eyes darkened, exchanging silent words to seal all of Luo Tian’s escape routes before rushing toward the combatants.

“Rest easy, Master’s abilities place him among the top five of the Nine Sons. A boy like Luo Tian cannot kill Master!” One Sage Peak master called out to the others while flying.

“Better safe than sorry—be cautious,” another replied, and the five fell silent.

Luo Tian’s face lit with joy as he watched the gray figure crushed by the Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram and the gray mist torn apart by two demon arrows. His eyes gleamed with determination.

“Opportunity!” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate, his body flashing into the path cleared by the arrows and escaping the gray mist.

“Trying to run?” Mingyuan’s face darkened as he saw Luo Tian escape the mist. He launched a Mortal King Seal toward Luo Tian.

“First deal with yourself!” Luo Tian drew his Wounding Heaven Bow again, firing a black demon arrow toward Mingyuan.

As Luo Tian reached Sage Peak Late Stage, he could fire the Wounding Heaven Bow ten times. Upon reaching Sage Peak Apex, he could endlessly wield it or other pseudo-Epoch Artifacts—this was his innate strength. His body and spiritual power were far superior to others of the same rank.

Mingyuan, having just mastered the Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram, saw the black arrow and his face paled. The gray figure reformed, reaching out to grasp the arrow.

The thunderous clash resumed. Though the shadow caught the black arrow, it gave Luo Tian a chance to escape. He smashed Mingyuan’s Mortal King Seal and vanished from his sight in an instant.

“Damn you!” Mingyuan’s face was dark with fury—he hadn’t expected to be outwitted by Luo Tian!

“Master!” As Luo Tian escaped, the five Sage Peak masters appeared before Mingyuan. Seeing he was unharmed, they sighed in relief. They could sense the brief clash had left their master slightly wounded.

“Master, rest assured—we’ll bring that boy to you!” The five masters said. Now they could sense Luo Tian’s escape route; with their speed, they’d catch him within half a day.

“Chase him!” Mingyuan’s gaze deepened, his body flashing toward Luo Tian’s direction.

“Jiang Xiong, speed up! I can’t hold on much longer!” Luo Tian pushed his speed to the limit, continuing his escape. He knew this time he was fully locked down by five Sage Peak masters—pursuit was only a matter of time.

“No more delays, I must think of a plan!” Luo Tian’s mind raced as he darted through the Four Sacred Star Domains. When encountering weaker enemies, he crushed them with a single punch; when facing Sage Peak masters, he avoided battle. Even a moment’s delay could let the pursuers catch up.

“Breaking God Cliff!” Luo Tian thought through his options, recalling that the only place in the Four Sacred Star Domains offering a chance of survival was Breaking God Cliff.

“Their goal is my Epoch Book, so they won’t let me go easily. Jiang Nanxuan hasn’t sent a message—meaning he’s not yet completed the retrieval.”

“No choice but to gamble!” Luo Tian’s eyes hardened. He flashed toward Breaking God Cliff, determined.

Two groups—pursuers and pursued—flew through the starry void of the Four Sacred Star Domains toward Breaking God Cliff.

Time passed slowly. The five Sage Peak masters’ speed surpassed Luo Tian’s Yellowneck Ghost Steps, and they now saw his fading silhouette.

“Boy, where do you think you’re going?” One Sage Peak master swung his hand, a massive gray palm locking onto Luo Tian’s path.

“Finally!” After half a day, Luo Tian reached the base of Breaking God Cliff. His eyes widened with awe—despite the chaos, even the Mortal Domain hadn’t affected this place. The cliffs were still lush with greenery, a sanctuary untouched by time.

“Damn!” As Luo Tian marveled, a crushing pressure suddenly enveloped him. The gray palm, carrying immense energy, appeared behind him and struck Luo Tian’s back.

*Boom…* Luo Tian felt as if hit by a mountain, blood spurted violently from his mouth. His eyes rolled back, and he plummeted toward Breaking God Cliff.

Chapter 1138: Killing by Leverage

At the peak of Breaking God Cliff, Luo Tian fell like a broken kite, his face pale as blood gushed from his mouth. His body was fractured, on the verge of shattering.

*Boom…* A thunderous sound echoed from Breaking God Cliff as Luo Tian’s eyes rolled back, crashing into the massive mountain body and losing consciousness.

“Breaking God Cliff!” The five Sage Peak masters appeared at the cliff’s edge, their gazes dark with intense reverence.

As Mortal Domain cultivators, they had heard of the Nine Perilous Zones’ fame. Even more so, the Mortal King’s Palace within their domain was a place of dread—its power so great that even the Nine Great Powers feared it. Those who had entered and returned never spoke of it, only warning others not to enter.

“Hum…” As the five masters pondered, Mingyuan appeared before them, his gaze fixed on Breaking God Cliff.

“That boy was hit by my palm and fell into Breaking God Cliff!” The old master who had struck him said, his face respectful.

“Hmph.” Mingyuan’s expression darkened as he stared at the imposing cliff, his mind racing. Should he enter?

“Enter—proceed with caution. That boy is injured; he likely won’t go deep. The Epoch Book must not be lost—should he have taken it into the cliff’s depths, we’d face great difficulty retrieving it!” After a brief deliberation, Mingyuan made his decision.

“Yes, Master. You need not enter—let us five go instead and wait here for you to retrieve Luo Tian,” the five masters said, unwilling to risk Mingyuan.

“No problem! If even he could enter while injured, what’s the issue for me?” Mingyuan shook his head.

“Yes!” The five masters bowed, surrounding Mingyuan as they entered Breaking God Cliff.

Luo Tian stirred awake, his gaze confused as he looked around. The towering cliffs and dense trees filled him with relief—he had entered Breaking God Cliff, a place he’d visited before.

“Ugh…” His face twisted in pain as he assessed his condition, his lips curling.

“Sage Peak Apex is so powerful!” His injuries were severe; his body was riddled with cracks. If not for his strong physique, he would have been crushed by that old master’s palm.

Previously, Luo Tian had believed his Sage Peak Late Stage strength allowed him to face a Sage Peak Apex master. Now he realized his mistake.

*Crack…* Without hesitation, Luo Tian pulled out a sacred herb and chewed it.

Sacred herbs were akin to another life, capable of reviving the dead and mending flesh. The green energy enveloped Luo Tian as his cracked body healed rapidly.

Not waiting for full recovery, he rose slowly, stretching his limbs without pause and heading toward the cliff’s peak. He knew there was no escape—his injuries weren’t fully healed, and even if they were, the five masters might already be searching for him outside.

Luo Tian dragged his wounded body toward the cliff’s peak, seeking a chance to survive. Due to his injuries and Breaking God Cliff’s immense pressure, he walked like an ordinary man.

Just one hour after leaving his original spot, Mingyuan and the five masters appeared at the location where Luo Tian had fallen. They saw bloodstains on the ground, their faces lighting up.

“That boy isn’t dead—his trail leads upward!” One master said, his gaze deep as he addressed Mingyuan.

The five masters were entering Breaking God Cliff for the first time, moving cautiously—otherwise, they wouldn’t have taken so long to arrive.

“This cliff’s first half isn’t dangerous, but I feel a suffocating pressure. The higher you go, the stronger it becomes—like being watched by a primordial beast!” One master said, gazing at the towering cliff.

“That boy could ascend—so can we!” Mingyuan repeated his words, but his gaze was more solemn now. His pace slowed.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian walked downward toward the cliff’s base, his gaze filled with unease as he observed the surroundings.

“This cliff has changed!” Luo Tian’s eyes darkened. Though the scenery seemed unchanged, he felt an unusual aura emanating from the cliff’s peak.

As he ascended, his cultivation was gradually suppressed—his spiritual energy dwindled, as if sealed.

“What has happened?” Luo Tian’s gaze deepened but he didn’t stop. Though his cultivation was suppressed, he knew the more it was, the better for him.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian’s body, once injured, fully recovered thanks to the sacred herb—but his cultivation dropped to Sage Peak Early Stage.

Luo Tian’s gaze darkened as he reached the highest point he had ever been to—The Bloodstained Site of the Reincarnation Body.

Blood splattered on the cliff walls, undiminished by time. It still radiated immense divine essence, as if eternal.

“Roar…” A roar echoed, gray mist forming at the cliff’s peak, causing Luo Tian to pale. This roar was familiar—he had visited this place four times before, including the first time he tricked a Sage Peak master of the Thunder Domain. This roar was the sound of the Soul-Eating Beast.

Gray mist poured from the peak, enveloping the entire cliff and transforming it into a hellish realm.

“This is Soul-Eating Mist! There’s a Soul-Eating Beast at the cliff’s peak. I understand now—this is a place of immortality!” The five masters’ faces lit with joy, gazing at the gray mist. Though it affected them slightly, their main concern was the strange laws that suppressed their cultivation.

“An immortality place must have a divine herb. If we obtain one of the immortal herbs, combined with that boy’s Epoch Book, our achievement would be immense!”

“An immortal herb capable of granting a second life to an Epoch Master—this is what we must obtain!” Mingyuan’s eyes hardened, leading the five masters toward the cliff.

Luo Tian stood outside the bloodstained area, a smile on his face. “I tricked one Sage Peak master before; now I’ll trick five! Let you all perish here!”

He found a hiding spot, waiting for Mingyuan’s group. The bloodstained area didn’t affect him—his greatest advantage. As for his weakened cultivation, he was confident. His body had never lost a battle; this weakening was actually beneficial. He doubted the five masters’ cultivation wouldn’t weaken too.

“As long as they aren’t Sage Peak Apex, I have a chance!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with amusement. He stood in his hiding spot, like a hunter waiting for prey.

Time passed slowly. No need to wait long—after less than half an hour of hiding, Mingyuan and the five masters arrived at the bloodstained cliff wall. Their faces were grim.

“This is the scent of reincarnation—this Reincarnation Body’s blood has remained for so long. This body must have been an unparalleled powerhouse, even facing Epoch Masters without fear! Who could kill such a power?” Mingyuan and the five masters looked stunned, speaking in awe.

“No matter what, we must move forward. This blood’s pressure is too great—how did that boy reach here while injured?” One master looked grim, their cultivation severely weakened by the blood.

“That boy must have had great fortune—carrying the Epoch Book and a few sacred herbs. He might have already recovered with them,” another master said, continuing upward.

“Regrettable—we can’t take it. The blood of a Sage Peak is a great treasure, perfect for refining into an unparalleled elixir with sacred herbs!” The five masters sighed at the bloodstain but dared not take it, fearing a terrible consequence.

As they moved forward, a faint bowstring sound echoed in their ears, causing them to pale.

Five black lights pierced through the Soul-Eating Mist, instantly appearing before them. Their faces darkened.

“You were right—my influence here is minimal! This is your final destination!” Luo Tian stepped out, standing before Mingyuan and the five masters.

Chapter 1139: It Has Appeared Again

At the bloodstained site of Breaking God Cliff, Mingyuan and the five masters’ faces darkened as five black lights appeared before them.

“Damn!” Mingyuan and the others grimaced, especially Mingyuan. Here, his power was severely weakened—Luo Tian’s arrow left no chance to dodge or resist.

The black arrow pierced Mingyuan’s body, blood spurted immediately, and the Great Dao Fracture spread.

*Boom…* Blood splattered as Mingyuan’s body shattered, scattering before the five masters.

*Plop… plop… plop…* The sound of arrows penetrating bodies echoed, and the five masters fared no better. Though they weren’t shattered, they suffered injuries.

“Luo Tian!” Mingyuan’s body reformed, his face dark with hatred as he emerged from the Soul-Eating Mist.

“Boy, you dare show your face again!” The five masters’ faces paled as they spat blood, suppressing the chaotic spiritual energy within.

“What can you do now?” Luo Tian’s face held mockery, his black demon energy swirling around him.

“Dare you think we fear you now?” The five masters rebuked, shielding Mingyuan. They knew he couldn’t be harmed again—another hit like that might kill him.

“No need to protect him. Since I’ve come out, I’ve already secured their deaths!” Luo Tian smiled, his presence unshaken by the immense pressure of the bloodstained area. He strode toward the five masters like a demon king.

“Arrogant!” The five masters glared at Luo Tian charging toward them, stunned he dared attack after being chased like a dog.

The five masters showed no fear, though their power was suppressed here. They still didn’t believe Luo Tian could defeat them.

Thinking this, the five masters flashed forward, their gray hands emitting pressure as they struck Luo Tian.

“Now you have no room to be arrogant!” Luo Tian’s face held mockery, his arms wrapped in demon energy. Using the Brahman Attack Technique and “One Force Overcomes All,” he clashed with their hands.

*Boom… boom…* The thunderous clashes left the five masters’ faces grim, their bodies retreating a few steps.

Luo Tian also retreated, his lips bleeding but eyes gleaming with excitement.

“It works!” Luo Tian’s heart pounded—after a brief clash, the five masters no longer seemed so fearsome. He could withstand their attacks now, unlike before when even a single clash left him injured.

“Kill!” Luo Tian’s body flashed forward, not retreating but advancing. The frustration from being chased and the massacre by the Mortal Domain’s forces had turned into his fierce killing intent.

“Die!” One master ordered the two behind him to protect Mingyuan while he and two others blocked Luo Tian.

“Go!” The two masters didn’t hesitate, leading Mingyuan away from the bloodstained pressure. Meanwhile, three others blocked Luo Tian’s path.

“You all will die!” Luo Tian roared, his Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist striking repeatedly. Combined with the Brahman Attack Technique and “One Force Overcomes All,” his power was overwhelming, like a demon king.

The three masters were Sage Peak Apex but handled Luo Tian’s attacks with ease, showing no hesitation.

The thunderous clashes echoed through Breaking God Cliff as the gray mist was stirred by their power.

The two masters led Mingyuan through the bloodstained pressure toward the cliff’s peak, their faces grim as they felt the terrifying waves behind them.

“He’s so strong!” Mingyuan gritted his teeth, his gaze deep as he stepped forward. He was shocked by Luo Tian’s strength—being a son of the Mortal Domain, Mingyuan had always been proud. Yet now he knew his gap with Luo Tian.

“Sss…” Green flames engulfed Luo Tian, burning everything. He punched repeatedly, each strike pressuring the three masters.

Luo Tian faced three Sage Peak Apex masters but wasn’t suppressed—though he suffered injuries, they were within his tolerance.

“Mourning God’s Sigh!” The three masters roared, their bodies intertwining. A massive gray figure appeared before Luo Tian, spewing gray spiritual energy.

“Again this technique!” Luo Tian’s eyes turned cold. He drew his Wounding Heaven Bow, its power swallowing the sky. Three black arrows shot forth, piercing through the gray mist toward the figure.

The three arrows pierced the gray figure instantly, and the three masters were scattered by the arrow’s power. Their faces paled as they stared at Luo Tian in disbelief.

“Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram!” At the same time, Luo Tian activated his diagram, which thundered toward the three masters.

“Disaster!” The three masters’ faces darkened as they saw the diagram’s overwhelming pressure.

“Brahman Attack Technique!” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate, his hands infusing the diagram with black seals.

*Boom…* The diagram expanded again, its pressure increasing by a continental realm—enough to harm even the three masters now weakened.

The three masters flashed their hands, creating gray barriers to block them.

*Crack…* A thunderous sound echoed through Breaking God Cliff, invisible waves turning into gusts that swept outward.

Mingyuan and the two masters, struggling forward through the bloodstained pressure, were suddenly accelerated. They emerged from the pressure’s range.

“What…” Mingyuan and the two masters stared at the collision site, their faces changing.

In the view, three Mortal Domain companions had their bodies shattered—like a single touch would crumble. Meanwhile, the black shadow stood there, its body protected by green flames and black demon energy, like a flame of demons.

“Die!” The green flames enveloped Luo Tian’s pale face, and he instantly appeared before one master, striking him with a punch.

The punch sent gray blood splattering across the cliff walls, spiritual energy spreading. The master was instantly turned into a mist of blood on the wall.

Luo Tian waved his hand, green flames and spiritual energy enveloping the bloodstain. A mournful cry echoed from the flames.

“Now it’s your turn!” Luo Tian stepped forward like a demon king, striking twice.

*Boom… boom…* The master met the same fate as his companion—his body turned into a mist of blood, and his gray soul howled in the flames before vanishing from Luo Tian’s sight.

“Luo Tian!” Mingyuan and the two masters stared at the three fallen masters, their eyes cold with hatred as they spoke.

“Regretful? When your Mortal Domain forces slaughtered ordinary people in the Four Sacred Star Domains, did you ever think of this day? Every one of your domain’s people is guilty. This is just the beginning—someday I’ll exterminate all of your Mortal Domain to avenge the lives lost in the Four Sacred Star Domains!” Luo Tian’s face still held killing intent as he addressed Mingyuan.

“Boy, if you dare show your face again, I’ll disintegrate you!” One master roared at Luo Tian.

“You think everyone’s as foolish as you? Come in, and I’ll beat you so badly your mother wouldn’t recognize you!” Luo Tian stood by the bloodstained area, shouting.

Though Mingyuan and the two masters were enraged by Luo Tian’s words, they knew they couldn’t enter. Three Sage Peak Apex masters had been killed by Luo Tian—returning would mean certain death.

“Those who disturb the slumber of the master shall die!” A cold voice echoed in their ears, its tone numb but instantly causing Luo Tian and the three masters to shiver.

“Again that thing!” Luo Tian’s face paled, sweat dripping from his forehead.

Chapter 1140: Mortal God Dagger

“Who!” The voice made Mingyuan and the three masters grim. They scanned their surroundings, a crushing pressure descending upon them.

Luo Tian’s face darkened. He had known of this terrifying presence before in Breaking God Cliff. Though he was now Sage Peak Late Stage, the entity still gave him a powerful pressure.

A ghostly figure appeared in their view—blood-red eyes scanning them before settling on Luo Tian. Seeing him near the bloodstained area, the red eyes showed a flicker of fear before focusing on Mingyuan and the two masters.

“An Epoch Master’s skin with sentience!” One master’s face paled, staring at the ghostly figure.

“Damn it—why did it target us!” Mingyuan’s face darkened, watching the sentient skin of an Epoch Master approach.

“This is a fragment of resentment—perhaps guarding something. The battle’s noise was too loud, awakening it!” One master explained to Mingyuan.

But before long, the fragment of resentment surged toward them with immense power.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian sighed, gazing at the bloodstains beside him and bowing respectfully.

“Thank you for saving me repeatedly, Master. When I achieve greatness, I’ll avenge your blood!” Luo Tian spoke softly, making a decision.

*Boom…* As Luo Tian spoke, the fragment of resentment clashed with Mingyuan and the two masters.

Though the two masters were Sage Peak Apex, and Mingyuan was a prodigy, without the bloodstained pressure, their power fully manifested. Yet against the sentient skin of an Epoch Master, they were suppressed—though not defeated immediately, they would eventually fail.

“Mourning God’s Sigh!” Mingyuan and the two masters merged into a ghostly figure, spewing endless gray spiritual energy toward the fragment.

“Roar…” The fragment roared, its body moving swiftly but with an unbalanced mind. It rushed into the spiritual energy flow.

The fragment’s red eyes glowed brighter, striking fist after fist within the gray spiritual energy flow. It seemed to lack martial arts skills.

“Don’t let it get close! Though it’s just an Epoch Master’s skin, its physical strength is beyond our ability to withstand!” One master called out, striking powerful martial arts within the gray mist.

“Mortals’ Seal… Mourning God’s Devouring Heaven…” The three masters unleashed their full power, striking the fragment repeatedly.

“Go!” Luo Tian saw the four clashing and resisted the urge to take advantage, waiting for both sides to weaken before killing Mingyuan. But he controlled himself—Mingyuan’s status in the Mortal Domain was high, and his survival methods were countless.

Luo Tian flashed forward like a ghost, avoiding their attacks and heading toward the cliff’s peak.

In truth, he could have fled downward to leave Breaking God Cliff. But an unseen call stirred within him, and he wished to explore the cliff’s secrets—perhaps uncovering how the Reincarnation Body had fallen.

His eyes now glowed with violet light, gazing at the peak. He saw the ruined palace he had seen before but not the white-cloaked woman holding an immortal herb, likely an Epoch Master.

“Luo Tian!” Mingyuan and the two masters’ faces darkened as he headed toward the peak. But their focus was on the fragment, leaving no room for distraction.

“Roar…” The skin expanded, and the fragment’s body surged forward. A drop of blood from the cliff wall flew into the withered skin, merging with it.

“Hum…” Though the blood had endured countless years, it still held immense divine essence—equivalent to a sacred herb.

The withered skin, now infused with the blood, instantly radiated vitality. Its body solidified into a human form, but its eyes remained hollow, emitting two red glows toward Mingyuan and the two masters.
