“Faking it? Keep faking it! This book contains nearly ten thousand herbal names and descriptions. Do you think you can memorize them all in three days? That’s incredibly naive!” The disciple of the Grand Elder, with a sneer on his face, watched Luo Tian’s expression shift. He secretly thought Luo Tian was still faking it; how could an ordinary person memorize them all in three days?

Hearing Luo Tian’s prompt agreement, Lu Kunpeng was somewhat surprised. He had thought this task was impossible to complete. His intention was merely to harass Luo Tian a little, then let him explode in anger so he could teach him a lesson and drive him out. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to accept it so readily, which left Lu Kunpeng momentarily stunned and speechless.

Chapter Forty-Seven: Practice

Luo Tian hadn’t expected Lu Kunpeng to test him on his strongest area. He had the Hundred Chapters of Dan Grass at his disposal, and although not every herb was listed, he estimated it would be largely similar. Without hesitation, Luo Tian agreed.

Seeing Luo Tian’s reaction, Lu Kunpeng felt a wave of embarrassment. He didn’t know how to handle Luo Tian next. He waved his hand and said, “Zhengyang, take Luo Tian and arrange accommodations for him!”

“Ah…” Lin Zhengyang was taken aback by Lu Kunpeng’s words. Clearly, he didn’t know how to arrange Luo Tian.

Muttering curses at his own foolish disciple, Lu Kunpeng’s face flushed with embarrassment: “Just take Luo Tian and find him a place to stay!”

“Yes!” Lin Zhengyang quickly bowed, then called out to Luo Tian as he walked outside.

“This boy has such a good disposition and powerful spiritual awareness. Plus, he’s the legendary Five Elements Body! Not cultivating elixirs is a pity!” Watching Lin Zhengyang and Luo Tian walk away, Lu Kunpeng’s face bore an expression of contemplation.

“Here you’ll stay,” Lin Zhengyang coldly led Luo Tian to a secluded courtyard. Obviously, he still harbored resentment toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian didn’t care much where he stayed. A place to rest when exhausted was enough, and the environment held no particular requirements.

“Ah… Finally entered the Five Elements Sect. These past few days were exhausting, but I suppose the gains weren’t small,” Luo Tian reflected on his experiences, summarized his achievements, and then fell into a tired sleep.

The next morning, Luo Tian resumed his busy life. He started with cultivation, then memorized the book on herbs Lu Kunpeng had given him. Luo Tian estimated it contained about ten thousand spiritual herb names, none of which were listed in the Hundred Chapters of Dan Grass. For Luo Tian, a day’s time was sufficient to memorize them.

During these three days, Luo Tian devoted most of his time to practicing the Thousand-Page Brushing Hands. On the first day, he memorized the herbs given by the Grand Elder.

On the second day, Luo Tian began practicing the Thousand-Page Brushing Hands.

At this moment, in Luo Tian’s courtyard, a pot of scalding oil appeared before his eyes. His eyelid twitched involuntarily. Although he had reached the sixth stage of body refinement, his physical strength was extraordinary, but thinking about inserting his hand into the oil, he felt a shiver of apprehension at the subtle changes.

Luo Tian cautiously placed his hand into the oil. The scalding oil seemed to do no harm, but when he gradually withdrew his Qi, a faint aroma of cooked flesh drifted into his nose. Luo Tian quickly pulled out his hand and activated Wood-element Qi to heal the burn.

Luo Tian grimaced: “This really isn’t human training! How come I felt nothing at all!”

After grumbling for a while, he unhesitatingly plunged his hand back in.

...

Three days later.

The news of Luo Tian’s successful memorization of ten thousand herbs spread quickly. Naturally, those who knew Lu Kunpeng’s intentions waited to see the so-called genius Luo Tian’s humiliation.

Lin Zhengyang was in a good mood today, as that fool who had embarrassed him publicly would now be disciplined by his master and sent back to Zhang Dianzhu.

Early in the morning, Lin Zhengyang led the disciples who had been knocked down by Luo Tian to Luo Tian’s small courtyard.

“Hey, Lin Senior Brother, today that kid will leave. Should we teach him a lesson? I think he’s only at the sixth stage of body refinement. Even with the Five Elements Body, he won’t be our match!” A senior disciple said to Lin Zhengyang.

Hearing the man’s words, the others looked toward Lin Zhengyang. Clearly, he was the leader among these young men.

“Hmph! Teaching a lesson? I would’ve taught him already. Why do you need to get involved? Remember, we are alchemists, not warriors! We should win people over with virtue!” Lin Zhengyang’s face showed a hint of arrogance, clearly不屑 to physically teach Luo Tian.

Seeing Lin Zhengyang’s demeanor, the others showed admiration in their eyes. They secretly felt ashamed for disgracing the alchemists. If Luo Tian and Lei Yong heard this, they would have let out a low sigh: “Idiot.”

But Luo Tian didn’t see this side of Lin Zhengyang. He continued to practice the Thousand-Page Brushing Hands diligently, though he felt no real progress. Although Wood-element Qi was present in his body, Luo Tian still had several layers of skin burned off.

“Luo Tian!” Lin Zhengyang pushed open the door to Luo Tian’s courtyard and saw him inserting his hand into the oil pot.

“Madman!” The senior disciples following Lin Zhengyang all thought these two words in unison.

The familiar aroma of cooked flesh drifted by. Luo Tian, as if nothing had happened, pulled his hand out and washed it in nearby clean water. As he dried his hands, he said with a smile: “It’s already been three days so quickly!”

At this moment, Lin Zhengyang and the others didn’t know how to describe Luo Tian. Inserting one’s hand into a pot of oil and acting as if nothing had happened—although he could have done it himself, clearly Luo Tian hadn’t used his cultivation!

“Three days are up. My master has summoned me to his place!” Lin Zhengyang’s face slightly straightened, recalling the task he had today.

“Oh, then let’s go!” Luo Tian casually tossed the towel aside and walked up to Lin Zhengyang.

“Hmph! Boy, if you can’t recite it, you’ll have a hard time!” The young men thought with cold smiles, regaining their composure from the shocking scene.

“Hey! Boy, you’ve got quite a lot of confidence. Originally, we wanted to teach you a lesson, but Lin Zhengyang Senior Brother taught us to win people over with virtue. So today you’ve escaped a beating. Do you know that?” The disciple who had previously insisted on teaching Luo Tian said with great magnanimity.

Luo Tian mentally cursed him for being an idiot. Being bullied when weak and not retaliating, then talking about virtue—Luo Tian couldn’t find words to describe these young men.

Luo Tian didn’t bother arguing with them. He just smirked: “Then thank you!”

After saying that, Luo Tian strode toward Lu Kunpeng’s courtyard, leaving the arrogant young men behind.

Today, Lu Kunpeng should have been happy but for some reason couldn’t feel it. Seeing a frail figure approach, Lu Kunpeng regained his calm face.

“How did it go? If you didn’t memorize it, I can give you a few more days!” Lu Kunpeng said calmly. After saying that, he himself was startled—why had he spoken such words?

“Don’t need to. Senior, please ask me. After all, your time is precious!” Luo Tian said indifferently.

Seeing Luo Tian’s nonchalant tone, Lu Kunpeng’s anger flared again. It was said that alchemists were the most arrogant, but this young man was even more so. He resolved himself and coldly said: “Boy, this is your own doing!”

Chapter Forty-Eight: Examination

Seeing Luo Tian’s indifferent gaze, Lu Kunpeng’s anger surged. He frowned and began testing Luo Tian.

“First herb: Ice-Phoenix Dan Grass. Describe its characteristics, medicinal properties, and which elixirs it can be used to make!” Lu Kunpeng casually named a spiritual herb, expecting Luo Tian to fail.

“Ice-Phoenix Dan Grass. Its properties contradict its name; it is mild and grows year-round on glaciers. However, extremes lead to opposites—this herb was born from such a paradox. The Phoenix Dan Grass is about one chi tall, growing one leaf per year. The more leaves it has, the older it is. It can be used to make Ice Spirit Elixir. The Ice Spirit Elixir is an elixir for those with water-element bodies in the Body Refinement stage. After repeated use, one can gain an insight into ice-element Qi. Those with talent may even master the ice element, allowing the water-element Qi within the user to transform into ice-element Qi, enhancing their attack power…”

Luo Tian spoke at length. The senior disciples waiting for Luo Tian to fail looked in disbelief. Lin Zhengyang muttered under his breath: “Impossible! How could it be? It must have been a coincidence!”

Lu Kunpeng’s face changed drastically because what Luo Tian had said: “This book didn’t record it like that!”

Lu Kunpeng was secretly shocked. He had memorized the book on spiritual herbs, and although he had asked casually, he clearly remembered that this book didn’t contain half of what Luo Tian had described.

“Broken Star Grass!” Lu Kunpeng showed no signs of abnormality and continued asking.

“Broken Star Grass. Its medicinal properties are toxic, growing in…” Luo Tian answered skillfully.

“Nourishing Spirit Milk!”

“Nourishing Spirit Milk. Its effects are mild, only growing a few drops in places with an Elemental Pulse…” Luo Tian spoke fluently and confidently.

Lu Kunpeng asked one herb after another, and Luo Tian answered each with ease. The onlookers were stunned, marveling at Luo Tian’s extraordinary memory—how could he remember so many herbs in such detail?

Those senior disciples who had intended to see Luo Tian fail now had no more arrogance. As a disciple of the Alchemy Hall, even if your cultivation was higher than mine, I still looked down on you. But if you were better at alchemy, I would respect you. This was a common trait among Alchemy Hall disciples. Luo Tian had now won the approval of these few disciples with his knowledge of herbs.

“100, 1,000, 10,000… 80,000…” Lu Kunpeng asked without showing fatigue, one herb after another.

Luo Tian remained calm and answered each question.

Time passed minute by minute. As the sunset gradually faded, Lu Kunpeng’s face turned red as he finished asking about the last herb in the book.

Luo Tian felt a lingering satisfaction, licking his dry lips. His answers had become more profound in understanding the medicinal properties and effects of herbs.

At this moment, the senior disciples were already numb. Watching the two men locked in a battle of wits, they didn’t know what to say. Lin Zhengyang looked at Luo Tian with admiration.

As the eldest disciple of Lu Kunpeng, he deeply knew that the number of herbs Lu Kunpeng had memorized was terrifying. Only a few people in the Five Elements Sect could reach such a level, and this young man hadn’t even used his full strength—there was an air of satisfaction.

“Can you continue?” Lu Kunpeng’s voice was hoarse. He now knew this youth had mastered herbs beyond the reach of ordinary alchemists. His eyes regarded Luo Tian as an equal in knowledge and no longer held any contempt.

“Yes!” Luo Tian replied indifferently, showing no fear of Lu Kunpeng’s question. His eyes, however, held a flicker of admiration—his knowledge was entirely due to the vast archives of the Epoch Book, while this old man relied solely on his accumulation. What kind of dedication to alchemy must one have to achieve this?

“Good, good, good!” Lu Kunpeng said three times.

“Now it’s no longer an examination but a discussion!” Lu Kunpeng said solemnly.

Hearing Lu Kunpeng’s words, the surrounding disciples were all filled with fervor. To witness Lu Kunpeng exchanging knowledge would greatly improve their own alchemy skills.

Lin Zhengyang, recognizing the opportunity, fetched paper and brushes to record. He sensed that today would witness the creation of a very comprehensive herbal scripture by his hands, even if he was only responsible for recording.

Lu Kunpeng decided to document the herbs both men knew. Lin Zhengyang would record Lu Kunpeng’s, while another disciple recorded Luo Tian’s.

...

Seven days later, Lin Zhengyang felt exhausted and took a deep breath. Next to him were two senior disciples, breathing heavily.

But Lin Zhengyang’s eyes glowed with infinite admiration. They had recorded all the herbs Lu Kunpeng had memorized. The countless books stacked up to nearly his height.

“108,312!” Lin Zhengyang looked at the final number and felt immense shock. As Lu Kunpeng’s eldest disciple, he only knew a few ten thousand herbs—his master’s head was still far beyond his reach. A sense of guilt arose in Lin Zhengyang’s heart.

“Young, your future is long. You will surpass me one day!” Seeing his disciple’s dejection, Lu Kunpeng encouraged him.

Lu Kunpeng drank some water and led the group out of the room. Since the day of the examination, Luo Tian and Lu Kunpeng had each occupied a separate room with three senior disciples accompanying them. They would recite verbally, and the disciples would record to avoid confusion.

Lu Kunpeng walked into the hall and was stunned. The hall was empty!

What did it mean for the hall to be empty? It meant Luo Tian hadn’t come out yet. Luo Tian had more herbs than Lu Kunpeng! How could Lu Kunpeng not be stunned? After all, he had spent half his life reading books to accumulate this 108,312 herbs. Yet this youth was so young!

“Master, Luo Tian hasn’t come out yet?” Lin Zhengyang also understood and asked tremblingly.

“Hmph, wait a bit!” Lu Kunpeng sat there with his eyes closed, pretending to rest. However, his powerful spiritual awareness spread toward Luo Tian’s room, revealing a shocking sight.

Luo Tian sat there reciting various herbs aloud. The three disciples recorded without pause.

“Had they not rested?” Lu Kunpeng, with his cultivation level, saw their appearance and clearly realized they hadn’t rested. That meant for seven days straight, they had been recording without pause.

Lu Kunpeng felt even more astonished. He and Lin Zhengyang had rested several times during these seven days.

“Just how did he know so many herbs?” After withdrawing his spiritual awareness, a massive question arose in Lu Kunpeng’s mind.

Chapter Forty-Nine: Stay

One hour... two hours...

Time passed quickly. Three hours later, the door to Luo Tian’s room opened slightly. Luo Tian walked out with a vibrant expression, while the three senior disciples behind him looked exhausted. If one didn’t know the details, they might have thought Luo Tian had done something to them.

He stretched his body and loosened his stiff limbs. Seeing Lu Kunpeng and the others, he blinked in surprise before greeting: “Grand Elder!”

“How many did you record?” Lin Zhengyang quickly asked his question.

As Lin Zhengyang’s words fell, Lu Kunpeng and the other two disciples also turned their eyes toward the four who had emerged.

Upon hearing this, the three behind immediately became energetic and looked at Luo Tian with reverence: “145,362!”

One of the senior disciples, unable to contain his excitement, spoke out.

Hearing this disciple’s words, everyone turned their eyes toward Luo Tian, looking at him as if he were a monster.

“Not quite. Don’t forget the ten thousand herbs from Luo Tian’s previous examination. If added, it would be 150,362!” Another disciple suddenly remembered and exclaimed.

The number “one hundred fifty thousand” was deeply imprinted in everyone’s hearts. People looked at Luo Tian for a long time without saying anything, their minds filled with the word “monster.”

Luo Tian had defeated the legendary herbal dictionary of the Alchemy Hall by nearly half. His expertise in herbs was rivaled only by the Alchemy Hall’s elder master, who was also Luo Tian’s mentor. No one else could match him.

Lu Kunpeng looked at the young man before him, his face showing a bitter expression. His lifelong efforts and pride had been defeated by this junior with an overwhelming advantage. This feeling was indescribable.

Seeing the bitter expression in Lu Kunpeng’s eyes, Luo Tian felt pity for this old man who had devoted his life to alchemy. He bowed and said: “Senior’s mastery of herbs is admirable. The reason I could memorize so many herbs was due to a chance I had in Tianyuan City. That’s all!”

“Don’t say it. A chance is part of one’s strength! I can still accept this loss!” Lu Kunpeng interrupted Luo Tian.

“Can you stay?” Lu Kunpeng’s face bore a hint of hope. He didn’t want such a talent to miss out on alchemy. At this moment, he no longer wanted to drive Luo Tian away.

Letting Zhang Ziping feel a little embarrassed was nothing compared to having a future genius like Luo Tian. Lu Kunpeng, who had devoted his life to alchemy, chose the latter. He wanted to know if Luo Tian would become a second Alchemy Hall master should he learn alchemy.

“I will strive to study!” Luo Tian bowed and showed respect. He respected this old man who had devoted his life to alchemy.

Lin Zhengyang and the other senior disciples clenched their fists, making a silent vow. From now on, they would take this young man as their goal.

“We are also alchemy geniuses. If Luo Tian can, so can we!” Their eyes showed an indescribable determination.

“Then for the next few days, you’ll help me organize these herbs. After that, I will teach you the art of alchemy.”

“Speaking of alchemy, Lu Kunpeng’s eyes regained their usual confidence.

The next day, with people’s astonished gazes, Lu Kunpeng walked into Luo Tian’s small courtyard with Lin Zhengyang, his face filled with excitement.

Seeing the dilapidated courtyard where Luo Tian lived, Lu Kunpeng frowned slightly. He hadn’t expected Lin Zhengyang to arrange such a simple and dilapidated courtyard for Luo Tian.

“Tomorrow, assign him an inner disciple’s courtyard!” Lu Kunpeng said angrily to Lin Zhengyang. He secretly sighed at his disciple’s petty nature. Not only had Luo Tian not offended him, but he was also the direct disciple of the Alchemy Hall master. If people knew Lu Kunpeng had let Luo Tian live in such a place, they would mock him for being stingy.

Seeing Lu Kunpeng’s anger, Lin Zhengyang felt a bit guilty. He cursed himself for not thinking thoroughly and immediately set out to arrange a new residence for Luo Tian.

Lu Kunpeng hadn’t even reached the door of Luo Tian’s courtyard when he sensed a wave of Wood-element Qi. His eyes showed admiration: “A person with绝顶天赋, yet so diligent. This boy will surely become a pillar of the Alchemy Hall and the Five Elements Sect!”

As he marveled, Lu Kunpeng arrived at the courtyard’s entrance. He pushed open the door and looked into the yard, where he saw Luo Tian using Wood-element Qi to heal his burned palm.

“Who told you to do this!” Lu Kunpeng became furious. He was utterly enraged by Luo Tian’s self-harm. For an alchemist, the hands were most important—through them one felt the properties of herbs and mastered the timing for refining them. Luo Tian’s actions were tantamount to self-destructing his alchemy future, which made Lu Kunpeng, who had devoted his life to alchemy, furious. Especially seeing a genius in front of him doing this!

Luo Tian was healing his palm, deep in thought. But suddenly, a wave of bone-destroying power surged toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian was merely at the sixth stage of body refinement. How could he withstand such power? Fortunately, the opponent didn’t intend to kill him; otherwise, just the pressure alone could have crushed Luo Tian instantly. Blood spewed from his mouth, and he felt like his internal organs had shifted positions.

Luo Tian looked up and saw Lu Kunpeng standing before him, his face ashen. Pure Wood-element Qi covered Luo Tian’s palm, and the burned, torn palm instantly restored to its original state!

Luo Tian sighed inwardly at the power of the bone-destroying stage. In an instant, his burned palm had fully recovered.

“Thank you, Senior!” Luo Tian bowed and said softly. He didn’t understand why Lu Kunpeng was so angry.

“Foolish! Don’t you know how important your hands are to an alchemist?” Lu Kunpeng looked at Luo Tian with disappointment.

“Uh!” Luo Tian was taken aback. He hadn’t expected Lu Kunpeng to be angry over this. But he had followed his master’s method, so what was the problem? Luo Tian was puzzled.

“From now on, prohibit you from using this self-harm method! I will personally teach you how to enhance your perception of herbs!” Without waiting for Luo Tian’s response, Lu Kunpeng said solemnly.

“This is my master who taught me! What problem is there?” Luo Tian asked his question.

“Foolish! I’ve never seen my master do this!” Lu Kunpeng became even more enraged. The bone-destroying stage’s pressure pressed down on Luo Tian again. At this point, he had a heart of pain, believing Luo Tian was lying. He couldn’t believe any alchemist would do this, and it hurt him that Luo Tian lied—this was clearly a character issue.

Chapter Fifty: Luo Tian’s Stubbornness

Seeing the expression in Lu Kunpeng’s eyes, Luo Tian roughly guessed what he was thinking. His face showed a bitter smile: “Senior, this is indeed my master’s teaching! How can you believe me?”

“Hmph! Stubborn and unyielding! Now is the time to admit your mistake. Otherwise, you’ll have to leave the Alchemy Hall! We don’t need someone who lies, even if Zhang Ziping protects you. As long as I disagree here, I can still kick you out of the Alchemy Hall!” Lu Kunpeng saw Luo Tian’s explanation but still didn’t believe him. His only alchemy master he respected would never teach his disciples this way—this was unrealistic.

What made Lu Kunpeng even more unbearable was that Luo Tian had lied outright, trying to deceive him. At this moment, Luo Tian no longer seemed like a genius in his eyes; even if he was a genius, if his character was bad, Lu Kunpeng wouldn’t look at him.

“Ah!” Luo Tian also broke out in a cold sweat. He understood that if he didn’t admit his mistake, he would be completely labeled as having a bad character in Lu Kunpeng’s eyes. However, Luo Tian felt grateful for the old man’s concern—he was afraid Luo Tian would take the wrong path. At that moment, Luo Tian didn’t know what to say. He believed his master would never harm him! But clearly, the method of his master and Lu Kunpeng’s philosophy were at odds.

“Master, the inner disciple’s courtyard prepared for Luo Tian is ready. He can move in anytime!” Just as Luo Tian and Lu Kunpeng were locked in a stalemate, Lin Zhengyang’s voice rang out.

“Hmph! What do you need to prepare? Let him stay here for now and reflect!” Lu Kunpeng’s angry voice left Lin Zhengyang stunned.

“What? Earlier you were so eager to teach Luo Tian alchemy, but now it’s like this!” Lin Zhengyang was puzzled but didn’t dare to ask further. He stood behind Lu Kunpeng, glancing at Luo Tian. When he saw the oil pot by Luo Tian’s side, he understood what had happened.

“Senior, I am telling the truth. This method is indeed my master’s teaching of the Thousand-Page Brushing Hands!” Luo Tian bowed again, his eyes showing stubbornness. Clearly, he was angry at Lu Kunpeng’s repeated disbelief.

“Thousand-Page Brushing Hands!” Upon hearing Luo Tian say the name of his master’s alchemy secret, Lu Kunpeng was stunned. Looking at Luo Tian’s stubborn gaze, his heart stirred.

“Since you insist it is the Thousand-Page Brushing Hands method, then practice it for me. In a month, there will be an alchemy competition in the Alchemy Hall. At that time, you’ll show me the Thousand-Page Brushing Hands. If you can do it, I will believe you and apologize. If not, you’ll have to leave the Alchemy Hall yourself. We don’t need liars!” Lu Kunpeng angrily waved his sleeve and strode out of the door.

“Master, should Luo Tian live in the inner disciple’s courtyard or…” Lin Zhengyang asked cautiously.

“Live? What live! He’ll be treated like an ordinary disciple. Anything he needs, he must exchange for elixirs!” Lu Kunpeng coldly said and ignored Lin Zhengyang, leaving on his own.

Lin Zhengyang looked at Luo Tian. He still had some admiration for Luo Tian, but seeing him stubbornly continue to burn his hands in the oil pot, he sighed and shook his head before leaving.

Watching them leave, Luo Tian’s eyes showed a bitter smile: “A month… time is pressing…”

Luo Tian sighed lightly, turned around and put his hand back into the oil pot, emitting a fragrant aroma.

“Something’s wrong!” As Luo Tian used Wood-element Qi to heal his palm, he showed a thoughtful expression. He recalled the method of practicing the Thousand-Page Brushing Hands.

A flash of inspiration struck him: “If I keep doing this, it will only increase the palm’s strength. But over these two days of practice, I’ve gradually felt that my palms not only had no sensation but also seemed to have become more numb!”

“Try without using Qi to protect the palm!” Luo Tian showed a fierce expression, deciding to directly put his hand into the scalding oil without using Qi.

“Sizzle…” A sound of pain echoed. As Luo Tian put his hand into the oil pot, he immediately pulled it out.

The terrifying temperature instantly invaded Luo Tian’s palm. Fingers are the most sensitive parts of the body, and ten fingers connect to the heart. Luo Tian’s forehead was drenched in sweat, but his eyes showed a flicker of joy.

“I felt it!” Luo Tian was delighted. Although it had only been an instant, he still felt the subtle changes in the oil pot.

Gentle Wood-element Qi passed over Luo Tian’s hand. He felt the subtle changes on his palm, his eyes filled with joy.

“Ah! It’s just painful. I’ll take the risk!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth and put his hand back into the oil pot.

Seven days passed quickly. During this time, Luo Tian had been diligently practicing the basic method of the Thousand-Page Brushing Hands.

During this period, Lu Kunpeng had come once. Seeing Luo Tian still acting like a madman by repeatedly inserting his hand into the oil pot, he scolded Luo Tian again and left. After that, he never came back.

However, Luo Tian’s story had somehow become known throughout the Alchemy Hall. Everyone knew that the Five Elements Body genius was acting like a madman by inserting his hands into the oil pot. Luo Tian, however, didn’t know that his mad behavior had overshadowed his Five Elements Body’s invincible physique.

That day, Luo Tian stood solemnly by the oil pot. His hands kept inserting into and pulling out of the oil, forming a blurred image of his hand between him and the pot.

“Finally succeeded! Now it’s time to start practicing alchemy!” Luo Tian took a deep breath, looking at his hands that had been inserted into the oil pot countless times. His eyes showed joy—after seven days, he finally felt the subtle changes in the oil pot.

“Hmph. There’s still plenty of time. For the next half-month, I’ll practice alchemy. Good alchemists are raised by feeding them herbs. Practice is the hard truth!” Luo Tian muttered to himself and walked out of the dilapidated courtyard.

The "Herbal Hall" was where the Alchemy Hall stored herbs. Disciples of the Alchemy Hall could collect herbs there.

Although the Alchemy Hall’s treatment was good, the herbs they received were just a drop in the bucket for alchemists who spent money like water.

Of course, there was another way to obtain herbs at the Herbal Hall—borrowing.

Chapter Fifty-One: Herbal Hall

Luo Tian stood at the entrance of the Herbal Hall, looking at the bustling disciples inside. He strode into the hall.

“Hmph?” As Luo Tian entered, the eyes of the disciples in the hall fell on him.

Although Luo Tian didn’t go out much, people had some impression of this genius who had just entered the Five Elements Sect. Especially in recent days, Luo Tian’s mad behavior had drawn many curious onlookers, so they knew what he looked like.

However, Luo Tian’s attitude toward the Grand Elder also made these Alchemy Hall disciples regard him with some hostility. Lu Kunpeng was a deity to the Alchemy Hall disciples, and Luo Tian had refused the Grand Elder’s teachings, instead doing mad actions. This made them feel uneasy.

“Luo Tian!” A familiar voice rang out in Luo Tian’s ears. Looking around, he saw a thin young man inside the counter waving at him.

“Dong Sansi!” Luo Tian hadn’t expected to meet him here. Seeing Dong Sansi dressed as an outer disciple, he understood that Dong Sansi had also entered the Alchemy Hall.

Seeing Luo Tian looking at him, Dong Sansi stepped out from behind the counter and asked excitedly: “How did you end up here?”

“Of course to collect herbs! What, are you going to trouble me? Rather than let me fail, I’d rather not!” Luo Tian joked. As a direct disciple of the Alchemy Hall master, he could certainly collect herbs; others wouldn’t be able to.

“Of course you can. But…” Dong Sansi looked around and seemed hesitant.

“What’s wrong? Is there a problem?” Luo Tian noticed Dong Sansi’s hesitation and frowned, asking softly.

“It’s not really a problem. Just your actions have become known to everyone now. Some Alchemy Hall disciples are very upset with you, and the most upset is Qidao Lin, the one in charge of managing the Herbal Hall! Ah… while he’s not here now, let me quickly take you to collect herbs!” Dong Sansi glanced inside and pulled Luo Tian toward the counter.

Luo Tian, wanting to avoid trouble, followed Dong Sansi.

Collecting herbs at the Herbal Hall required waiting in line. But with Dong Sansi as a colleague, Luo Tian naturally took the shortcut. He just needed to hand over his identity jade token, and Dong Sansi would handle the rest.

Luo Tian lazily sat at a nearby table sipping tea, watching the discontented glances around him. He sighed inwardly: “The Grand Elder truly has high prestige in the Alchemy Hall!”

“Who let you give him herbs! Get out! Where is Luo Tian!” A scolding voice rang out.

Luo Tian looked up and saw Dong Sansi, his face red, following a middle-aged man who walked out from inside.

“Where is Luo Tian!” The middle-aged man asked again.

“Senior Qidao, Luo Tian isn’t here. He…!” Dong Sansi looked toward Luo Tian’s direction, seemingly telling him to leave quickly.

The middle-aged man saw Dong Sansi’s eyes and followed his gaze toward the leisurely sitting Luo Tian. His face showed a flicker of anger, and he strode toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian naturally saw Dong Sansi’s eyes but ignored them, observing the middle-aged man approaching. Although the man looked only at the eighth stage of body refinement, Luo Tian felt he was much stronger than Zhang Daoyi.

“You are Luo Tian, right? Get out! The Herbal Hall won’t give you a single herb. You’re so strong, go get it yourself!” The middle-aged man coldly looked at Luo Tian.

“Why?” Luo Tian’s eyes also turned cold. It was his right to collect herbs, and he hadn’t broken any rules. If anything, it was just Dong Sansi giving him a favor. This wasn’t really an issue. But this middle-aged man wouldn’t let him collect herbs, which made Luo Tian angry.

“Don’t ask why. The Herbal Hall is my domain. You should go refine your cultivation. Alchemy isn’t suitable for you, don’t disgrace the alchemist profession!” Qidao Lin mocked.

The people around heard Qidao Lin’s words and felt they were a bit harsh. What Luo Tian did was his own business; why should Qidao Lin care? Because Luo Tian didn’t obey the Grand Elder, he wanted to cut off his herbs and mock him for not being an alchemist?

“Idiot! You control everything, even my business? I can do whatever I want. What’s it to you? If you have the strength, kick me out of the Five Elements Sect! If not, don’t make a fuss!” Luo Tian finally couldn’t hold back and cursed at him. For such people, he knew that being polite would be useless.

“Who did you say?” Qidao Lin heard Luo Tian’s retorts and his face turned cold. His cultivation level of the eighth stage of body refinement radiated, hinting at a potential outburst.

“Who did I say? I said you! What’s wrong with that? Idiot! Give me my herbs back. The Alchemy Hall’s rules aren’t yours to set. Daring to withhold my herbs? Believe me, I’ll report it to the Hall Master and the Elders!” Luo Tian continued shouting.

“You! What are you? Daring to talk like that to me!” Qidao Lin’s face turned red and he rushed toward Luo Tian, raising his hand high.

“I am what? I am the direct disciple of the former Hall Master and the younger brother of the current Hall Master. I was first in the Ascension Stairs! You say I am what?!” Luo Tian’s face darkened, and his aura suddenly rose.

“I am a direct disciple. You are merely an inner disciple. In terms of status, you are inferior to me. I am a Five Elements Body; what about you? Single-element fire-body. In terms of talent, you are inferior to me. You only have the advantage of age. Managing the Herbal Hall makes you so arrogant? What are you then?” Luo Tian ignored Qidao Lin’s red face and continued speaking loudly.

“I am older, with higher cultivation. Today I will teach you a lesson! What can you do?” Qidao Lin coldly said, clearly having lost his head in anger. A thirty-something man being scolded by a twenty-year-old made him furious, but Luo Tian’s words were all true. He couldn’t refute them.
