Chapter 2538: The God's Altar

"Could it really be that guy? After all, when we passed through the City of Soul and the City of Heaven, he wasn't there!" Diao Dezhù spoke, his voice laced with exasperation.

"Impossible! How could it be so coincidental!" Sun Kelnian shook his head hurriedly, dismissing the idea as a coincidence and refusing to believe it was Luo Tian.

"Regardless, we need to retrieve our belongings first—our livelihoods were taken!" Sima Tuo's lips twitched as his attire was formed by the primordial energy of heaven and earth.

"Damn it, why am I so fat!" Sun Kelnian cursed, feeling his physique was a defect. His attire materialized far slower than Sima Tuo and Diao Dezhù's.

"Wait—Grand Elder was also stripped by him! Ha, Grand Elder's attire is also formed from heaven and earth energy!" Sun Kelnian laughed as he watched Zhang Chenglong standing there with a solemn expression.

"Indeed, I was puzzled too. We were all stripped, but why wasn't Grand Elder? Unfortunately, we didn't see the old man's naked form!" Sima Tuo chuckled.

"Shut up..." Zhang Chenglong, caught in the act, blushed deeply, prompting Sun Kelnian and Sima Tuo to shout.

"My heavens! What did I just see? Grand Elder actually blushed! It's worth it, really. Just losing a few things—seeing the old man suffer this much is worth it!" Sun Kelnian and Sima Tuo laughed heartily, watching Zhang Chenglong.

"Pat pat..." Zhang Chenglong swung his palm and smacked both of them on the head. "Laugh again, and I'll beat you to death!"

"Rumble..." As Zhang Chenglong's words faded, a wave of energy rose above their heads, darkening the already dim sky.

"What's going on?" The four men instantly grew solemn, their gazes turning to the distance as they grouped together.

At that moment, Luo Tian and Mota were equally bewildered. Before them stood a vast altar, its surface swirling with Daoic laws. Black phantoms circled the altar.

"Crack crack..." What startled Luo Tian and Mota was that the skeletal remains on the ground, which had crumbled at a touch, now stood up swiftly and converged toward the altar, bowing before it.

"What is this altar? These people have been dead for ages—why do they still pay homage?" Mota exclaimed, watching the withered bones and surrounding phantoms kneeling in what seemed like an ancient ritual. Luo Tian was deeply shaken.

"This is a sacrifice, but who are they sacrificing?" Mota asked, watching the divine inscriptions on the altar surge violently.

"Could there really be something?" Luo Tian's heart trembled as the ritual continued, sensing a terrifying energy gathering on the altar.

"Roar..." As Luo Tian and Mota were stunned, a series of roars echoed in their ears. Their bodies halted instantly, as if under the influence of a demonic sound. Each black figure stood in formation before them, lifting both men and carrying them toward the altar.

"What kind of power is this!" Luo Tian and Mota's eyes widened in fear, feeling the demonic sound reverberating within their minds. This power was indescribable yet suppressed their cultivation, rendering them powerless.

"This is world energy!" Luo Tian's mind screamed as he encountered such dense world energy for the first time, unable to resist.

The black figures carried Luo Tian and Mota forward, making the two feel increasingly uneasy.

"Are they trying to use us as sacrifices?" Luo Tian felt a sense that he and Mota had become the altar's offerings, though they didn't know who was being worshipped.

"Six Paths of Reincarnation!" No matter what, being restrained wasn't good. Luo Tian resolved to first regain movement before acting further.

The Six Paths of Reincarnation energy roamed Luo Tian's body, clashing against the world energy. Two opposing forces collided violently, producing a thunderous roar within Luo Tian's body.

"Useful!" Luo Tian felt relief, beginning to move as he gradually regained sensation. However, the black figures swiftly carried them onto the altar, a cold sensation instantly invading their bodies, causing Luo Tian to shudder.

The heavens stirred; a colossal face emerged above the dark sky, its icy gaze locking onto Luo Tian and Mota. The two felt a surge of fear.

"Who is this!" Luo Tian's heart trembled, the first time experiencing such a primal fear.

Black script dragons descended from the sky, wrapping Luo Tian and Mota like icy serpents. Their hair stood on end as the dragons coiled around them.

"Break free!" Luo Tian realized he couldn't wait any longer, sensing the scripts were absorbing his cultivation and blood.

"This power is similar to Jiang Chen's!" Luo Tian felt the suction was nearly identical to the force used by Luo Shengmen's Jing Wu Ye when he had possessed Jiang Chen.

...
Under the relentless冲击 of the Six Paths of Reincarnation, Luo Tian finally regained normalcy. With a thunderous roar, the black scripts were shattered, dispersing into swirling dark mist before him.

Regaining movement, Luo Tian immediately grabbed the black scripts binding Mota, his hands brimming with Six Paths of Reincarnation energy. He tore them apart.

"Down!" Luo Tian pressed six fingers, creating whirlwinds around Mota. He pulled Mota downward, flying toward the altar's base.

"Roar..." Luo Tian attempted to flee, but the black figures roared and rushed toward him.

"Buzz..." A series of black spears shot toward Luo Tian, darkening his expression. He drew a blood-red sword, slashing at the spears. The collision produced an immediate sound.

Each black spear was severed by Luo Tian's blood sword, and he slashed through several shadows, carving a path.

"You go first!" Luo Tian kicked Mota's backside, sending him flying out of the opening. After all, Mota was still unable to move.

...
Mota fell from the altar, gazing at Luo Tian now surrounded by shadows. Moreover, as Luo Tian shattered a few, the shadows' aura grew stronger. A hundred of them, their presence overwhelming, cold light flickered from the black mist toward Luo Tian.

"Roar..." The face above the sky showed a flicker of interest in its black eyes, watching Luo Tian battling the shadows. The demonic sound continued to flood into his ears, slowing his reactions. Though these black figures seemed weak, Luo Tian could slice through them one by one. Yet the pressure from the altar grew stronger, making his body feel heavy.

"What is this thing?" Mota lay on the altar's base, watching Luo Tian's battle. His body gradually regained sensation.

"Another immortal thing?" Luo Tian struck several times, but after being severed, the black figures reformed within thirty breaths.

"Crash..." Finally, Luo Tian waved his hand, sending a flurry of talismans from his palm. These were the ones scavenged from Sun Kelnian and Zhang Chenglong's belongings.

Lightning flashed, thunder roared, fire raged—vast energy erupted from the altar. A powerful冲击 struck Luo Tian's body, spewing blood as he was hurled backward.

Luo Tian's body landed awkwardly on the ground, his gaze fixed on the massive altar with an expression of disbelief.

"This is terrifying! Are these talismans so strong?" Mota's eyes widened in awe, watching the altar now engulfed in a storm of lightning and fire.

Numerous black figures howled, instantly disintegrating into dust under the apocalyptic energy. Luo Tian's lips twitched; he hadn't expected these talismans to be so powerful, still continuously striking.

"Thankfully I was thrown down; if not, I'd have been severely injured!" Luo Tian muttered, approaching Mota.

"These are our talismans—so quickly used! And so many! It's a waste. These talismans are all precious treasures!" At that moment, Zhang Chenglong and the others also heard the thunderous roars, cursing loudly.

These talismans were prepared when they entered hell, collected by Zhang Chenglong over years of exploring major tombs. They were ancient talismans, each priceless and immensely powerful.

"This energy is close by—let's chase after it! I want to see who dares to steal from me!" Zhang Chenglong cursed, leaping into the air toward the altar.

The thunderous roar lasted half a bell before fading. Luo Tian and Mota stood at the altar's base, waiting for the energy to dissipate. The entire altar was devastated; the face in the sky vanished without a trace.

Luo Tian attempted to step onto the altar, dust swirling around him, earning a faint smile.

"I still have about thirty left!" Luo Tian counted the talismans in his storage ring, a smile on his face.

"I have over a hundred left!" Mota's eyes gleamed with excitement, stepping onto the altar.

"Let's go in and check!" The two took a step across the altar, heading toward the city's depths.

As Luo Tian and Mota left, Zhang Chenglong and the others arrived at the altar's edge.

"They ran again!" Sun Kelnian saw two rows of footprints on the altar, gritting his teeth.

"This... is the God's Altar!" Zhang Chenglong observed the altar, his expression stunned.

Chapter 2539: The Mountain-Sea Cauldron

"God's Altar?" Hearing Zhang Chenglong's words, Sun Kelnian and Diao Dezhù looked puzzled. They had never heard of such a term before.

"In ancient times, people worshipped gods, but those deities were merely cultivators who reached their peak. They established altars across the land, where people offered sacrifices. The so-called gods were powerful because they were emperors!"

"Those altars were meticulously arranged by those emperors themselves," Zhang Chenglong said, excitement in his voice.

"Could there still be emperors alive?" Diao Dezhù and Sun Kelnian's faces shifted slightly.

"It can't be; it must be an emperor's residual imprint! This city is now a dead city," Zhang Chenglong replied.

"Why did the people here worship? Why would emperors, who had reached their peak, require offerings?" Diao Dezhù looked puzzled. Zhang Chenglong, a tomb raider who had traversed major tombs, clearly knew many ancient secrets.

"I once reached the deepest part of the Death Desert and entered a Buddha's tomb near Mount Sumeru. It seemed that receiving offerings from people granted power, and this power was extremely strong—nearly matching world energy."

"That Buddha called it 'Faith Energy!'" Zhang Chenglong's eyes reflected nostalgia, clearly impressed by that journey.

"Let's chase after them! Don't let them get too far; our treasures are still in their hands!" Diao Dezhù gritted his teeth.

"Don't rush; they won't escape ahead. But this altar is a good find—don't miss it!" Zhang Chenglong chuckled, lightly patting the dust-covered altar.

"This sacrifice probably wasn't for a good person; it required offerings. In ancient times, it must have been something like a demon god," Zhang Chenglong's eyes showed caution.

"A good find?" Hearing Zhang Chenglong, Diao Dezhù and the others' eyes lit up. This was an altar left by an emperor—there was no way it would be ordinary.

"Let's dig this altar open; the feng shui here is good. After so many years, even storage rings couldn't withstand it. This altar remains intact—clearly something special!" Zhang Chenglong waved his hand, summoning a shovel.

Sun Kelnian and Sima Tuo also each received a shovel. These items weren't stored in their storage rings, so they escaped Luo Tian and Mota's search. Even if the two saw them, they wouldn't have taken interest.

"Crack..." Sima Tuo raised his shovel to strike the altar, but it remained unmoved. Sima Tuo's brow furrowed slightly.

"Are you a tiger? If this could be dug up, it wouldn't be an emperor. Listen to me—go to the back of the altar three zhangs away; you should find something. Sun Kelnian, go there..." Zhang Chenglong directed them, three of them standing at different positions.

"Crack..." This time, it was smooth—shovel struck, and large pieces of stone began to crumble.

"Hey hey, old man, how come you have this skill? You never taught us!" Sun Kelnian's eyes lit up, addressing Zhang Chenglong.

"Rubbish! I have many skills; would I teach them all to you? Teaching your apprentice starves the master. That's a big taboo in our trade. When I finally go into my coffin, I'll leave everything for you!" Zhang Chenglong sneered.

"Cut it..." Sun Kelnian and Sima Tuo muttered, not taking it seriously. They began digging with their shovels.

...
On the other side, Luo Tian and Mota continued walking. The sky remained dark. Mota's eyes glowed with silver light. They passed through ruins filled with bones, arriving at a relatively intact building.

The structure was shrouded in black mist but emitted green light and murmurs, making Luo Tian and Mota wary again.

"Gurgle..." A bubbling sound echoed from the ruins, smoke swirling.

"Be careful!" Luo Tian and Mota transmitted mentally, their vast spiritual awareness enveloping them as they stealthily approached the courtyard.

They quickly reached the broken wall's exterior, glimpsing the scene within.

A massive cauldron stood in the courtyard, bronze with ancient patterns. However, it bore green copper rust, clearly aged. What stunned Luo Tian and Mota was the thunderous sound from within the cauldron, as if it were refining a pill.

"Does this cauldron constantly refine pills..." Mota's voice trembled, a chill running down his spine. Though there were no alchemists in hell, Mota naturally knew about pills.

"I don't know. Stand still and don't move; I'll check. If anything's wrong, you pull me out immediately!" Luo Tian instructed Mota, this cauldron clearly not ordinary. He intended to take it.

As he spoke, Luo Tian leaped into the courtyard. Upon entering, a wave of energy struck him, attempting to push him out.

Luo Tian stepped forward toward the cauldron. Each step unleashed more intense energy, striking his body. Luo Tian's body paused slightly, even he had to pause for a moment before steadying himself.

"Luo Tian, how are you?" Mota shouted, watching Luo Tian's condition.

"Nothing; this cauldron is a bit tricky!" Luo Tian shook his head, gazing at the cauldron with more anticipation.

Luo Tian took another step forward toward the cauldron, and the overwhelming pressure struck him again, causing his body to sway.

"I won't believe it! A broken cauldron that's existed for billions of years could block me!" Luo Tian sneered, opening his domain to push through the pressure toward the cauldron.

Boom boom boom...
The thunderous sound kept echoing, and with each step Luo Tian took, cracks spread across the ground. Yet his pace didn't slow as he marched toward the cauldron.

Ten zhangs... a hundred zhangs...
After an hour, Luo Tian finally reached the cauldron's side. He extended his hand to grasp its body.

"From now on, you belong to me, Luo Tian!" Luo Tian chuckled, but before he finished speaking, the cauldron emitted a rebellious aura.

Boom...
The cauldron slowly lifted from the ground, attempting to escape Luo Tian's grasp.

"Want to run? Stay put!" Black hands grabbed the cauldron's leg, and Luo Tian pulled it down forcefully.

"Boom..." Dust swirled as the cauldron was slammed back to the ground with a闷 sound.

"Buzz..." The echo resonated, and the cauldron flew back toward the sky again. The void trembled, a powerful repelling force acting on Luo Tian's hand. His large hand formed by cultivation was beginning to show signs of collapse.

"Xiaoqi!"
"Let me refine it!" Luo Tian roared, ten-color flames instantly engulfing his body, forming a sea of fire that enveloped the entire cauldron.

The firestorm spread, covering all directions. At the same time, the cauldron was forcefully slammed back to the ground by Luo Tian. This time, he leaped into the air and sat on top of the cauldron's lid.

Luo Tian meditated, his spiritual awareness instantly surged into the cauldron. He knew this cauldron might have an artifact spirit; only by subduing it could he claim the cauldron.

In the dim space, his spiritual awareness rapidly spread, ten-color flames following it, covering everything in fire. The cauldron kept shaking, trying to escape Luo Tian's suppression, but it never escaped. Instead, as the space was infiltrated by ten-color flames, its shaking became smaller and smaller.

Time passed slowly; after an hour, Luo Tian filled the space with ten-color flames, and a connection formed between him and the cauldron.

"Mountain-Sea Cauldron!" Luo Tian instantly knew its name, a relic crafted by someone named Zihui.

Zihui was an emperor-level cultivator from ancient times, known as the Emperor Zihui. The Mountain-Sea Cauldron was his personal treasure, once a world-grade artifact.

However, over time, to maintain the Mountain-Sea Cauldron, its world heart had died. If a world heart could be integrated, the cauldron would regain its world-grade status.

"Good treasure!" Luo Tian's face showed admiration. If not for the passage of time, this cauldron's artifact spirit would have been erased, and it wouldn't have come to his hands.

Luo Tian extended his hand, lifting the cauldron's lid. A surge of overwhelming energy burst forth from it, a feeling that was very pleasant.

"Medicinal power!" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly, instantly sensing this energy could enhance cultivation.

"Mo Tian, come here; this is a good treasure!" Luo Tian's face showed a smile, sitting down again to refine the abundant medicinal energy.

"Good!" Mo Tian also showed a smile, leaping into the air and landing beside Luo Tian. He activated his cultivation method to refine it.

The rich medicinal aroma spread from the ruins, enveloping the entire city. In the city's depths, a figure sat on a altar.

"Who disturbed my medicine!" A black figure slowly awakened, its voice filled with anger.

On the other side, Diao Dezhù and others completely dug up the altar, revealing a black crystal. Zhang Chenglong quickly grabbed it.

"Old man, are you going to eat this alone?" Sun Kelnian shouted, his voice filled with anger.

"This altar should have nine more; this one is the ninth emperor position, understand? There's still more for you!" Zhang Chenglong replied, crossing his arms.

Chapter 2540: Euphoria

On the towering cauldron, Luo Tian and Mota sat cross-legged in midair, its澎湃 medicinal energy erupting. Two whirlwinds formed above their heads, absorbing the energy into their bodies.

"Great!" Mota's heart was excited; this medicinal energy had accumulated for countless years. Even without control, the Mountain-Sea Cauldron naturally absorbed surrounding vitality, refining it into medicinal energy. Over time, it might form an extraordinary pill.

Unfortunately, Luo Tian and Mota didn't know this. Even if they did, they wouldn't wait. After all, neither of them understood alchemy well, and the time required might exceed their lifespans.

Boom boom...
The two happily absorbed the cauldron's medicinal energy, their bodies producing thunderous sounds. Luo Tian's face grew increasingly grim because he noticed his dantian was saturated, and the medicinal energy seemed to vanish into the void.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly. The last time, this was why he failed to break through to the middle stage of Immortal King. This time, he had planned to use this abundant medicinal energy to try again. Unfortunately, he had overestimated himself.

"I'll see where you can refine it to!" Luo Tian ignored everything, continuing to absorb the energy.

"Almost there! Almost there!" Mota's heart was excited, the sensation of breakthrough growing stronger. If he had another hour, he could attempt to break through to the middle stage of Immortal King.

"Someone's here!" Luo Tian's voice made Mota startled, and the cauldron's lid closed, interrupting Mota's absorption.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian waved his hand; the massive Mountain-Sea Cauldron suddenly shrank, becoming palm-sized and returning to his hand.

"Now isn't the time for absorption; let's leave first!" Luo Tian instructed Mota, leaping into the air toward the city's depths.

Mota's eyes narrowed; he saw four figures rushing toward them. He secretly regretted not killing the four earlier, avoiding this trouble.

But now there was no turning back. Even if he repeated the trick, the four would have prepared and wouldn't fall for it again.

The two vanished from their spot in a few breaths, and Zhang Chenglong and the others appeared, their faces dark.

"I don't believe you can run anywhere! The treasure, the Rebirth Grass—we all want it!" Zhang Chenglong coldly spoke, and the four leaped forward toward Luo Tian and Mota.

"Those four bastards are fast!" Mota was astonished, feeling the four's speed was slightly faster than theirs. If this continued, they'd be caught soon.

"Can you fight three alone?" Mota's voice echoed in his ears.

"One vs. three..." Mota's lips twitched; he knew Luo Tian also understood the situation and planned to turn back and fight.

"You think everyone's like you!" Mota bitterly replied; he truly admired Luo Tian, who could fight three Immortal King beginners alone. He himself could only manage one vs. two.

"Then keep running; this city is large. Maybe there's a chance. If it gets too bad, we'll have to fight!" Luo Tian replied, and the two rushed through the city. There was no hiding place; the entire city had turned into ruins.

In a flash, Zhang Chenglong and the others caught up, seeing Luo Tian and Mota's blurry silhouettes.

"Two young men, your speed is good, but you're still too slow compared to me!" Diao Dezhù's figure moved like lightning, rushing toward Luo Tian and Mota. He was confident he could catch them in a few breaths.

"Altar!" Luo Tian and Mota's faces changed; before them stood another black altar, nearly identical to the one they had encountered.

Black mist swirled over the altar, obscuring what lay atop it.

"Haha, kids, you stopped!" A loud laugh echoed behind them as a purple lightning bolt shot toward their direction.

"Go in!" Luo Tian and Mota didn't hesitate, rushing into the altar, their bodies obscured by black mist.

"Escaped to the altar!" As they entered, Diao Dezhù and Zhang Chenglong's figures appeared outside the altar, seeing their silhouettes.

"This silhouette is familiar..." Diao Dezhù's eyes showed confusion, but only for a moment. He didn't recognize it as Luo Tian, though the black mist was dense enough to block even spiritual awareness.

"Still ran!" Sun Kelnian and Sima Tuo followed, gazing at the black altar.

"Chase after them?" Diao Dezhù and the others looked to Zhang Chenglong. The black mist gave them a sense of danger, but entering it wouldn't harm them.

"Chase what? This altar isn't as simple as you imagine!" Zhang Chenglong smiled, watching the swirling black mist.

"We can slowly kill them!" Zhang Chenglong's hands moved, and countless Daoic laws flew from his palms into the black mist.

"Don't kill them; they didn't try to kill us!" Diao Dezhù spoke, reluctant. He feared Zhang Chenglong's mischief would end their lives.

"Don't worry; the Master of This Era knows what to do!" Zhang Chenglong's face showed confidence. He had cast hundreds of Daoic laws into the black mist.

"Still Master of This Era? You've reached the Immortal Realm, I see you're a brothel master!" Sun Kelnian sneered, knowing Zhang Chenglong had a special preference. His brothels were all his own.

"You little bastard, I'm your Grand Elder!" Zhang Chenglong roared, crossing his arms and standing outside the altar.

Inside the black mist, Luo Tian and Mota tried to escape the altar but found it endless.

"They didn't catch up!" Luo Tian and Mota stopped, gazing around. They wouldn't have entered this altar if not forced; the previous one had left a deep impression.

As they spoke, the scene shifted. The black mist rolled back, revealing a vast road before their eyes.

The road had no men; women in revealing attire walked everywhere, greeting Luo Tian and Mota constantly.

"Ugh..." A series of soft breaths echoed on the street, making Luo Tian and Mota's hearts stir.

"An illusion!" Luo Tian and Mota instantly realized they had fallen into an illusion, a particularly potent one.

"Ha! How amusing!" Mota scoffed; with his Moon-Eclipsing Eye, illusions had little effect on him.

"Silver light flickered; Mota looked toward the distance, but his expression darkened immediately. Even with his Moon-Eclipsing Eye, he couldn't see the exit of this illusion.

"Who's technique is this? Even my Moon-Eclipsing Eye can't penetrate it!" Mota exclaimed, causing Luo Tian's heart to sink.

If they stayed here too long, they'd be overwhelmed by their desires. Desire-fueled fire wasn't pleasant at all.

The road stretched endlessly, with numerous women on both sides enticing Luo Tian and Mota with various seductive gestures.

"Stay grounded!" Both men reminded themselves mentally that this was an illusion; if anything happened, they'd lose their lives.

Their minds were resolute, and for now, they weren't corrupted. Even with their eyes closed, the seductive figures remained in their minds.

"It's hot!" Mota felt parched, his eyes closed tightly, but he still felt the women had approached him, their hands touching his body.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian and Mota endured the immense pressure, Daoic laws suddenly descended from the sky, striking their bodies. This law felt like oil on fire, instantly igniting them.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed, opening his eyes to find them red. He knew he had been tricked; this was definitely a technique used by someone.

...
"Old man, you just need to press a few hand signs inside and it's safe?" The others looked at the black altar, their eyes filled with confusion as they watched Zhang Chenglong.

"You don't understand! Do you know what this altar is called? It's the Euphoria Altar. Not everyone can withstand it! Though it's been so long, its power has faded a bit. But the hand signs I just pressed are like an aphrodisiac, stimulating them!"

"They should thank me for letting them enjoy their departure. The most enjoyable part is when we finish them off!"

"If my guess is right, they've already started. We can dismantle this altar now!" Zhang Chenglong's face showed confidence as he spoke to Sun Kelnian.

"Very cruel, but I like it. Those two aren't good men either; they stripped our clothes!" Diao Dezhù sneered, standing still as Zhang Chenglong and the others began their work.

At this moment, Luo Tian and Mota's faces were flushed red; their bodies felt as if on fire. At this moment, Luo Tian's eyes no longer saw Mota but the women in revealing attire, a surge of desire constantly restrained.

"Blood Sword!" Luo Tian waved his hand, and the blood sword appeared in his palm. He slashed it across his arm.

Blood flowed from Luo Tian's arm immediately, the pain bringing him a bit of clarity. He knew he couldn't indulge; if he did, it would be irreversible.

Chapter 2541: Encounter

"What to do?" Luo Tian's heart was anxious. Though he had regained a bit of clarity, the desire still remained.

"Star Spiral!" Luo Tian had no choice but to think of Fu Xingxuan, but this thought caused the surrounding figures to transform into Fu Xingxuan, Sudan, and even Leng Qiuchan.

"This damn thing is really deadly!" Luo Tian's nose bled as he let out low growls. If he couldn't resist, he'd be lost in this euphoria and die.

"Epoch Book!" Luo Tian had no choice but to activate his last lifeline. His spiritual awareness surged, colliding with the Epoch Book in his mind. The powerful spiritual awareness instantly enveloped the book, controlling it to fly out of his mind.

...
Luo Tian's head roared violently, the Epoch Book emitting waves of energy, floating like an elder in his mind.

However, as Luo Tian's spiritual awareness struck the Epoch Book, it helped him significantly. The indecent images in his mind dispersed with each strike of the Epoch Book.

"It's much better now!" Luo Tian felt joy, ignoring everything else and continuing to strike the Epoch Book fiercely.

Boom boom boom...
The thunderous sound kept echoing from Luo Tian's body, invisible waves spreading outward. As this roaring sound spread, the surrounding illusory figures around Luo Tian and Mota also trembled violently, beginning to disintegrate.

"What's that sound?" Diao Dezhù looked at Zhang Chenglong and the others, hearing the thunderous noise from the altar.

"It's quite intense; they're probably pushing through!" Zhang Chenglong's face showed a lecherous smile, continuing to dig into the altar.

"What is this!" In the city's depths, the figure seated on the last altar showed disbelief.

"I never thought... I never thought!"
"If I could obtain him, my chances of resurrection would be greater!" The figure's eyes gleamed with joy, as if recalling something.

"Ah..." But just as the figure spoke, waves of divine light rose from its body, causing it to scream in pain.

"I've survived for billions of years; I won't let you, a little runt, defeat me!" A cold voice echoed, and waves of black energy erupted, enveloping the figure.

"When I subdue this guy, I'll go get that book and that person!" The black figure roared, madness in its voice as the black energy completely consumed the figure's sound.

...
Cough cough...
As Luo Tian continued to strike the Epoch Book, the powerful illusion finally shattered. Mota's face was drenched in sweat, regaining clarity.

"Damn it!" Mota cursed, his outer clothing now on the ground, bare-chested with a large bulge beneath him, looking quite awkward.

Luo Tian also sighed deeply, watching Mota's state with a smile before turning away—this was an awkward moment no one wanted to witness.

"Come on, look at the Master of This Era's handiwork! Daring to strip me, I'll kick their butts later!"

"Prepare yourselves, three of you. When the illusion disappears, subdue them immediately!" As Luo Tian and Mota just emerged from the illusion, a voice full of confidence echoed in their ears.
