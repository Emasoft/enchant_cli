“Ha ha, a black VIP card—I’ve never seen one before. Does it represent the Black Earth?” Huang Youshan laughed as well, his words causing laughter from those around him.

“This… this…” Ye Liangchen stared at the black card in Luo Tian’s hand, his face filled with disbelief. He clearly remembered that his father, Ye Wudao, also possessed such a card. Back then, when he had asked for it, Ye Wudao hadn’t given it to him, treating it as a treasure.

“Son, should I carve out a toilet in my private room for you to sit? It’ll be bigger than yours! Ha ha!” Huang Youshan cruelly mocked, gazing at Luo Tian as if looking down on a beggar.

“Respected VIP, I am Lan. It’s an honor to serve you!” As Huang Youshan’s words faded, a soft voice echoed in the crowd. A woman in a blue long robe stepped out from the auction hall.

She had a pointed face; each feature was ordinary, but together on her pale skin, they formed an exquisite beauty. Her figure was well-proportioned—though not a masterpiece, it exuded a pleasant charm that caught the eye.

Behind her stood nine women in thin red dresses, their forms barely visible through the fabric, evoking a seductive aura that made one’s pulse quicken.

“Respected VIP…” Upon hearing the woman named Lan address Luo Tian with such title, people realized that the VIP card in his hand was no ordinary one.

“Ha ha! No wonder my old man refused to give me his card. This card is truly enjoyable!” Ye Liangchen laughed aloud, his eyes flicking greedily toward the nine red-clad attendants.

“Respected VIP, these nine attendants will obey your every command, including any arrangement!” Seeing Ye Liangchen’s expression, Lan addressed Luo Tian.

“Hmph. Thank you! Please lead us into the hall,” Luo Tian nodded. Since arriving in the Immortal Realm, he had been celibate for a long time. These red-clad women stirred his desires, and their willingness to obey him made it clear he could do as he pleased. Though he had thoughts of exploring their bodies, he dared not—his wives’ authority still loomed.

“Hmph. Respected VIP, please enter…” Lan’s face showed slight surprise; this was her first time hosting such a young Respected VIP. Still, she maintained a professional smile and guided Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen forward.

“Damn it… even my father didn’t have this black card…” Huang Youshan’s face looked as if he had eaten dirt. He had just mocked Luo Tian, but now the latter had struck back. Watching those luscious red-clad attendants, Huang Youshan burned with jealousy.

“We’re leaving!” Yet Huang Youshan had no choice. This was Huan Tian Island; he could do nothing against Luo Tian. Even outside the island, with Ye Liangchen by Luo Tian’s side, he was powerless. The Star River Sect’s power surpassed his own sect.

“Hmph. Mid-Three Heavens’ sects’ masters only have such status. I didn’t expect Luo Tian, so young, to possess it!” People wore expressions of envy as they murmured.

Under Lan’s guidance, Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen arrived at a vast private room. The chamber was fully equipped; if only Luo Tian, Ye Liangchen, and Cen Weihong were there, it would seem empty.

“Truly comfortable! More so than my place!” Ye Liangchen lay on a plush chair, two red-clad attendants massaging his legs while he emitted contented sounds.

“Hongwei, go enjoy yourself. Such moments are rare!” Luo Tian smiled, understanding Ye Liangchen’s thoughts as a man.

“Never mind,” Cen Weihong refused outright, though his eyes occasionally flicked toward the attendants.

“Lan, prepare a separate room for my brother. You know what to do—serve well, and these spirit stones are yours!” Luo Tian waved his hand, tossing two storage bags to Cen Weihong and Lan.

“Yes, Master!” Lan’s eyes brightened slightly before leading Cen Weihong out of the room.

“I don’t want to go…” Cen Weihong, caught by Lan’s hand, blushed and addressed Luo Tian.

“I’m your uncle, fool. We’re men; no one will mock you! Right, Ye Liangchen!” Luo Tian chuckled, glancing at Ye Liangchen before his gaze froze.

Chapter 1896: Beginnings

At that moment, Ye Liangchen was already fully engaged. He couldn’t even hear Luo Tian’s words. As the top纨绔 of Mid-Three Heavens, Ye Liangchen was a veteran in pleasure halls, effortlessly maneuvering—only a step away from action.

“Go on. I’m your uncle; listen to your uncle! Lan, my nephew is a novice—serve him well! Got it? If he’s unsatisfied, I’ll be upset. Who knows what might happen…” Luo Tian threatened.

“Rest assured, Master. We’ll ensure this gentleman is satisfied!” Lan smiled confidently, leading Cen Weihong down with reluctant steps.

Luo Tian allowed the two red-clad women to massage his legs but kept them from going too deep. His gaze was fixed on the window.

This private room’s position was excellent, offering a view of the entire auction hall. The transparent windows prevented anyone outside from seeing in, not even with spiritual awareness.

Other private rooms adjacent to Luo Tian’s were empty—no one with a Respected VIP card had arrived.

Yet Luo Tian noticed someone seated in a lower private room: Huang Youshan.

“That’s Lang Xiu of the Trembling Demon Sect… That’s Chang Ziyang of Purple Cloud Mountain…” Ye Liangchen appeared behind Luo Tian, his expression lazy as he spoke.

Luo Tian observed the people in the private rooms—each was carefree, clearly not a promising prospect. Like himself and Ye Liangchen, they wore the air of纨绔.

“Are these all from Mid-Three Heavens?” Luo Tian asked, watching the youths seated in each room, each accompanied by a True Immortal.

“They’re all second-generation heirs. We don’t have grand ambitions; we compete not by strength but by wealth, power, and the number of women…”

“Even Jiang Yuzhe is one of us!” Ye Liangchen smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

“Parental favoritism!” Luo Tian sighed. These youths had no real strength, but their backgrounds were formidable.

“Then why did you come to the Lower Three Heavens’ Huan Tian Island? Is there something you want here?” Luo Tian asked, interested. These纨绔 wouldn’t waste time unless they had a purpose.

Though coming to the Lower Three Heavens allowed them to show off, Luo Tian had once been a纨绔—his time with Zhang Daotian on the Xiantian Continent.纨绔 valued face and showed off, but they also cherished life. Leaving the Mid-Three Heavens would be dangerous for them; after all,纨绔 disciples had likely offended many.

“Senior Tian, we do want something. Please help me when the time comes!” Ye Liangchen wore a fawning expression, addressing Luo Tian.

“I’ll do my best. After all, I rely on you to show off and fly with me in the Mid-Three Heavens. Oh, I forgot to mention—I’m also a disciple of Star River Sect!” Luo Tian laughed, producing a token: the inner sect token of Star River Sect.

“Huh? Senior Tian, I’ve never seen you in Star River Sect. With your status, how could you remain unnoticed?” Ye Liangchen looked puzzled; as the son of a sect leader, he would recognize Star River Sect members.

“I passed Star River Sect’s trials to become a disciple. I haven’t yet arrived at the sect, so please look after me!” Luo Tian smiled. This纨绔 Ye Liangchen was bold but genuinely suited his taste.

“Don’t worry, Senior Tian. Once we reach the Mid-Three Heavens, I’ll show you off and fly with you. Just know that in the Mid-Three Heavens, there’s nothing I, Ye Liangchen, can’t handle!” Ye Liangchen took full responsibility, feeling Luo Tian was his kindred spirit.

“Ding…” As they spoke, a clear sound rang out. A senior stepped onto the auction platform, smiling.

“It’s starting, Senior Tian. When they auction the dragon egg, please help me get it!” Ye Liangchen smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

“Okay…” Luo Tian nodded. He was also interested in the dragon egg; an item auctioned by Huan Tian City wouldn’t be a common earth or flying dragon. Its bloodline must be extremely high.

“Please look at the first auction item!” As Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen spoke, the senior on the platform smiled, addressing the crowd. Luo Tian felt a slight shock—first items were usually of high quality.

Not long after, two attendants stepped onto the auction platform, placing a tray before the senior.

“Everyone must have heard of our Lower Three Heavens’ great sage, Shuhua Xian!” The senior smiled, knowing the name of Shuhua Xian was renowned.

“Shuhua Xian?” Luo Tian’s expression shifted. He possessed the pen shaft of Shuhua Xian’s Zhen Xian Pen. The senior’s words made Luo Tian focus on the tray, but the red cloth seemed to block spiritual awareness.

“Back then, Shuhua Xian cultivated from our Lower Three Heavens to True Immortal peak. His Zhen Xian Eight Styles became famous in the Immortal Realm. Unfortunately, he died young!”

“Our Huan Tian Auction House’s first auction item is the hair of Shuhua Xian’s Zhen Xian Pen. Whoever finds the Zhen Xian Pen and reunites it may revive Shuhua Xian’s former glory!” The senior spoke, then tore open the red cloth. A series of gray threads appeared in people’s sight.

A powerful fluctuation spread from the gray threads, causing a commotion among the crowd.

“This Zhen Xian Pen’s hair is made from the silk of Soul-Eating Silkworms—extremely precious. Soul-Eating Silkworms are definitely a King Beast! Just this hair is worth a fortune. Starting price: five hundred thousand spirit stones, with increments of at least fifty thousand!” The senior didn’t pause, immediately beginning the auction.

“Must get it!” Luo Tian muttered internally. Reuniting the Zhen Xian Pen would definitely enhance his strength!

“Five hundred and fifty thousand!” The senior’s words had barely finished when the crowd shouted, as five hundred thousand spirit stones was the minimum.

“Six hundred thousand… seven hundred thousand…” Soon, voices of increasing bids echoed in people’s ears, quickly reaching one million spirit stones.

“Five million!” Luo Tian, seeing the bids rise, shouted decisively, his voice resolute.

“Sigh…” Hearing Luo Tian’s bid, the auction crowd momentarily froze, stunned by his sudden leap.

“Who is this? So rich, he jumped straight to five million!” People followed the sound’s source and found Luo Tian’s private room, their faces shifting slightly.

“Respected VIP Room—haven’t seen one open in years. Which sect’s master is it?” Everyone fell silent, as the private rooms prevented them from seeing Luo Tian inside. Yet Luo Tian could clearly see everyone, including the people in other private rooms.

“Damn it, who’s that old fart? He’s so shameless to come personally!” In a luxurious private room, a youth with a flirtatious face looked at Luo Tian’s position.

“Exactly! It’s insulting us. A broken dragon egg, yet he comes himself—this isn’t bullying us!” Other private rooms also erupted in curses.

“You’ve been deceived. That room isn’t a sect master’s—it belongs to a son, Ye Liangchen’s friend!” Huang Youshan looked at Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen, his face sneering.

“Damn it! Ye Liangchen, damn it… It’s really Ye Liangchen that bastard!” Several private rooms erupted in curses, leaving the auction crowd speechless.

“Ha ha! You bastards, are you jealous?” Ye Liangchen opened the window, revealing his arrogant face.

“Ye Liangchen, did you steal your father’s VIP card? Let us see it!” Several youths eagerly shouted, not caring it was an auction.

“Five million… three times…” As the youths’ words ended, the senior on the platform spoke with a helpless expression, urging people back to the auction.

“It’s sold…”

“Damn it, I forgot…” People realized,懊恼 for focusing on the spectacle and the纨绔 showing off.

“Five million, we’ve made it!” Luo Tian smiled. He had expected at least eight million, even more.

“Good job, Ye Liangchen! Thanks!” Luo Tian patted Ye Liangchen’s shoulder. He hadn’t expected Ye Liangchen to be useful.

“Ha ha! You bastards, listen up. Who wants in? Tell me a few nice words, and the money for these girls hasn’t been paid yet. Whoever pays it, I’ll let them in!” Ye Liangchen stood by the window, addressing several private rooms.

“This is an auction!” Everyone was speechless, watching Ye Liangchen.

“Senior Chen, my beloved Senior Chen, you forgot how we once fought a dragon together and defeated thirty-six golden flowers!” A youth shouted loudly, not feeling the least bit embarrassed.

“Damn it, Chang Ziyang! You’re bringing up old times? Know I eat this kind of thing. Come on!” Ye Liangchen waved his hand, addressing the youth in purple silk.

“Got it…” Chang Ziyang laughed, leaping into the air and entering through the massive window, his face filled with joy.

“Damn it, this is讲究! I finally know why my father didn’t give me the VIP card. This really is face!” Chang Ziyang surveyed, then spoke loudly, standing beside Ye Liangchen. His gaze swept over the other纨绔 with a contemptuous look.

“This… damn it, he found superiority…” Luo Tian was speechless watching Chang Ziyang.

Chapter 1897: The War Song of the Barbarian God

Several纨绔 completely disrupted the auction, drawing everyone’s attention to Ye Liangchen and Chang Ziyang by the window.

“Ha ha! Wolf pup, want to come up? Talk to your senior Chen and he’ll let you in!” Ye Liangchen shouted, his voice full of arrogance.

“Senior Chen, Senior Chen! Next time in Hongluo Alley, I’ll treat you. Heard there are new girls, let me show them to you!”

“Senior Chen… Senior Chen…” Other纨绔 also spoke, their flattery echoing.

“Who else wants to fight me over that dragon egg?” Ye Liangchen smiled, looking at the other纨绔.

Hearing Ye Liangchen’s words, the other纨绔’s faces darkened. Their main purpose was the dragon egg—this was their elders’ orders. They couldn’t disobey; if their fathers learned they had given up the dragon egg for show, they’d be beaten.

“Guys, are you sure you can beat me? You don’t know what a Respected VIP means. Can you borrow one billion spirit stones?” Ye Liangchen sneered at them.

“Right, Senior Chen, don’t worry. I definitely won’t compete with you!” Chang Ziyang thought Ye Liangchen’s words made sense. Star River Sect was already wealthy in the Mid-Three Heavens; even Ye Liangchen’s monthly allowance of five hundred thousand was astronomical.

“I won’t compete either. Who can beat Senior Chen?” Several纨绔 shouted, leaping into the massive private room.

“Damn it, this is really luxurious. I’ve never seen such a place!” The纨绔 disciples shouted.

“…” Luo Tian was speechless at these fools, but he knew they weren’t stupid. They likely realized they couldn’t beat Ye Liangchen or had good relations with Star River Sect, or their backgrounds were strong enough.

The auction senior’s mouth twitched; the auction was already difficult. If these纨绔 didn’t bid, they might let Ye Liangchen take a big advantage.

Yet the senior was relieved that several纨绔 didn’t go to Ye Liangchen but stayed in their private rooms, obviously wanting to compete.

“Alright, everyone please look at the next auction item…” The senior smiled again, announcing the auction’s continuation.

As Luo Tian had guessed, the second item was a sixth-grade elixir. Though rare, Luo Tian had no interest in elixirs.

But even if he wasn’t interested, others were. The private rooms’纨绔 shouted and bid fiercely.

Watching the纨绔 keep raising their bids, Luo Tian understood their power—completely treating spirit stones as if they were rocks. An elixir that could sell for fifty or sixty thousand was raised to a million by these youths, finally bought by Chang Ziyang.

“You did well today. I’ll give it to you!” Chang Ziyang grabbed the elixir that had come with Luo Tian’s bid and gave it to a red-clad attendant massaging him.

“Thank you, Master!” The red-clad attendant was overjoyed, taking the elixir and working harder.

“Chang Ziyang, you’re doing well! Recently got rich?” The other纨绔 laughed, clearly accustomed to such things.

“Wasteful!” Luo Tian sighed but said nothing. Everyone had their own way of life.

Luo Tian was excited, taking the Zhen Xian Pen’s hair and tearing open the red cloth.

“Reunite it!” Luo Tian grabbed, cold energy swirling on his fingertips. The gray threads were collected into his storage ring.

“Wum…” Next moment, the Zhen Xian Pen’s hair and shaft fused within Luo Tian’s storage ring. A sky-high aura erupted from the Zhen Xian Pen, gray light seemingly about to burst the ring, making Luo Tian’s face show joy.

“Ha ha! A top-grade immortal weapon!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered, sensing the Zhen Xian Pen hovering in his storage ring. The entire bag seemed to contain only this pen, other treasures emitting worshipful energy! Only Lie Tian Gun and Yin Yu remained standing—unaffected!

“Is it because Lie Tian Gun and Yin Yu generated a weapon spirit?” Luo Tian mused. Upon arriving in the Immortal Realm, he had felt the纪元 relics differed from Immortal weapons—those forged by纪元 Lords had weapon spirits, but Immortal weapons didn’t.

Luo Tian guessed that纪元 relics or King Weapons, though suppressed in the Immortal Realm, still had growth potential. Perhaps they could one day reach top-grade immortal weapons.

He thought of the Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword, which Zhang Daotian had told him once. The Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword had nearly reached top-grade immortal weapon status but failed due to lacking a sword spirit. Actually, it had some intelligence, but followed Zhang Daotian into the Nine Realms, injured and dropped to a Heaven-Grade treasure level.

“A top-grade immortal weapon—enough to make anyone desire it. But with Shuhua Xian’s strength, he could indeed create one—otherwise how would he fight the Demon King Sect’s immortal king!” Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with anticipation. Though his current strength couldn’t fully activate a top-grade immortal weapon, he knew full activation would be earth-shattering.

Luo Tian returned to reality. Regardless, today’s revival of the Zhen Xian Pen was already a great gain.

The auction proceeded calmly, each item brought out by Huan Tian Island’s people causing gasps. Some items even made Luo Tian envious, but he knew they were useful for others, not himself. He needed a martial art—something that let him fight at a higher level than semi-True Immortals.

Though he currently had no fear of semi-True Immortals, it was all due to external forces—Nine Realms’ Book and the Heaven-Ordained Seal. Though powerful, they had drawbacks.

Luo Tian didn’t bid but others did. Especially the纨绔, as if competing, spending money like water. Some items were bought for themselves; others were given to attendants, the ultimate纨绔, making people below the platform feel心疼, wishing they could be attendants.

“Ah, the difference between people and pigs is huge! People compared to pigs die!” Everyone’s eyes held envy, envying the纨绔 for having good fathers and teachers.

Time passed slowly; the auction was gradually nearing its end. Luo Tian had bid twice, buying two rare herbs but no others.

“Next auction item: High-Grade Immortal Martial Art!” The senior smiled, silencing the auction hall.

“High-Grade Immortal Martial Art!” Everyone’s faces showed shock, their eyes on the tray carried by attendants. Their breaths quickened.

The纨绔 also wore solemn expressions; they knew the crucial moment had arrived. The last three items were treasures, and their elders had ordered them to strive for at least one.

“This item could be a martial art or a cultivation method. We, Huan Tian Island, don’t know what it is.”

“This is an ancient wall we discovered in the Lower Three Heavens. The wall was inscribed with incomprehensible characters, exuding a terrifying aura and an oppressive feeling. Thus, our island master transcribed it. After analysis by Huan Tian Island, this is likely a martial art or cultivation method—High-Grade!” The senior spoke, then opened the jade slip.

“Wum…” Complex characters appeared in people’s sight. Each large character was vigorous, filled with a sky-high battle spirit and ancient aura, grand and imposing, as if standing in a vast battlefield. A bloodthirsty killing intent spread through the auction hall, stunning people’s minds.

The senior opened it for a moment before closing it again, fearing someone would recognize the ancient characters and memorize them, making their effort pointless.

“This…” People regained consciousness, faces filled with shock. That feeling was truly震撼.

“What person could infuse battle spirit into the characters? This martial art or cultivation method is definitely High-Grade!” Ye Liangchen shouted, his status as a纨绔 evident.

“Everyone must recognize this. Starting price: ten million spirit stones!” The senior smiled, addressing the crowd.

“Is it Man Shen Zhan Ge?” Luo Tian stood there, his eyes filled with disbelief. He had seen these complex characters before—after all, he had spent much time in the Barbarian Clan.

“Man Shen Zhan Ge!” Luo Tian whispered, though only for a moment, he had seen the name of this cultivation method or martial art.

“Could it be the Barbarian God?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed confusion. He hadn’t expected to find a relic left by the Barbarian Clan here.

“Huan Tian Island’s auction is truly surprising!” Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with excitement, watching the jade slip on the platform.

Chapter 1898: The Bow of Shooting the Sun

“Get it! We must get it. This is a relic left by the Barbarian God. It might be useful against the镖, or it could lead us to find the Barbarian God. After so long, if the Barbarian God is in the Immortal Realm, his strength must be formidable!” Luo Tian muttered internally. This Man Shen Zhan Ge was more important to him than the Zhen Xian Pen’s hair!

“Three million!” As Luo Tian was excited, a voice rang out in the auction hall. The voice was familiar—Huang Youshan’s.

“Damn it, Huang Youshan! Did you eat too many eels? Can you even understand this?” Seeing Huang Youshan’s bid, Ye Liangchen cursed.

“Laozi wants to. Can you stop me? Collect it, okay?” Huang Youshan sneered, his face red, eyes challenging Ye Liangchen.

“Four million!” Ye Liangchen was enraged by Huang Youshan’s challenge and immediately bid.

“Five million!” Huang Youshan smiled coldly, continuing.

The auction crowd watched the spectacle. They knew the last three items weren’t for them but for these纨绔.

This was a rule they discovered early in the auction: no one could take items from these纨绔 unless they were also纨绔 like Chang Ziyang and the others.

“Six million…”

“Seven million…” Ye Liangchen and Huang Youshan fought like roosters.

Luo Tian looked at Huang Youshan, wanting to know if he truly understood the Man Characters or was just provoking Ye Liangchen.

At the same time, Luo Tian organized his storage ring and bags. He had about three million spirit stones—most obtained through extortion, some from refining elixirs for others, and more generated by dragon eyes.

“Intentional overbidding?” Luo Tian sighed. He knew Huang Youshan couldn’t understand Man Characters, just trying to drain Ye Liangchen’s spirit stones.

They had often competed secretly before, but this time was harsher.

“This cultivation method or martial art is truly impressive. But it’s a bone to chew—only those who understand can learn it!” People watched Ye Liangchen and Huang Youshan keep bidding, quickly raising the price to twenty million spirit stones.

“Ye Liangchen, do you need this?” Luo Tian addressed Ye Liangchen. Why was he so eager to compete?

“No, I just want to raise the price and make this bastard lose spirit stones!” Ye Liangchen’s eyes showed tension. He was like a gambler, betting Huang Youshan would bid again.

Huang Youshan was also similar, his face sweating. Both had the same goal: to bet the other would continue bidding.

“Damn it…”

“Ye Liangchen, let me take this. I’ll help you fight for the dragon egg!” Luo Tian addressed Ye Liangchen.

“Senior Tian, are you interested in this?” Ye Liangchen looked at Luo Tian. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to want this incomprehensible jade slip.

“I want to study it. I can borrow one billion spirit stones here. When you fight for the dragon egg, I’ll help!” Luo Tian spoke softly.

“Good! I was about to stop bidding!” Ye Liangchen nodded, then smiled at Huang Youshan: “Take it! I don’t want it!”

“Two…” Huang Youshan heard Ye Liangchen’s words, about to bid again and withdraw. But Ye Liangchen had already given up.

“Ye Liangchen, why stop? Are you scared?” Huang Youshan’s face was covered in sweat. The price had reached twenty-four million, which for him was no longer a number. Huang Youshan hadn’t expected Ye Liangchen, who usually couldn’t be provoked, to give up.

“No, I just don’t want it. I still need to fight for the dragon egg! We’re old acquaintances, and since you like it so much, I’ll give it to you!” Ye Liangchen sneered.

“You…” Huang Youshan looked unwell. Clearly, this gamble had been lost by Huang Youshan.

“Ye Liangchen, gambling is about knowing when to stop! Ten bets nine lose; the winner is always the house!” Luo Tian addressed Ye Liangchen. Ye Liangchen suited his taste—though a纨绔, arrogant, he had the capital. Though this capital wasn’t his own.

But Luo Tian knew gambling’s dangers. No matter how Ye Liangchen was a womanizer, as long as he had limits, it was fine. Men were all womanizers, but gambling could consume one’s humanity.

“Twenty-four million, three times….” As the senior’s hammer fell, Huang Youshan’s face turned pale.

“Twenty-four million for a scroll of incomprehensible characters, ha!” Several纨绔 laughed loudly.

“Alright, now announcing the second-to-last item: a middle-grade immortal weapon. Everyone here must know how precious middle-grade weapons are. Though valuable, your sects likely have a couple each. But this weapon is different—once a master refines it with rare materials, it becomes a top-grade immortal weapon. This weapon hasn’t fully formed yet!” The senior spoke.

This time, it wasn’t attendants but several strong men—True Immortal initial stage—carrying a tray, covered with red cloth.

“Wum…” The senior lifted the red cloth. A fluctuation rose from the tray, revealing a black long bow.

The dark bow resembled a black dragon, its aura sky-high. A powerful pressure radiated from the bow.

“This bow we call the Bow of Shooting the Sun, crafted by master refiner Lu Chong. It’s one of Lu Chong’s masterpieces. However, it lacks a suitable string, so it’s listed as a middle-grade weapon. If someone finds the right string, it will become a top-grade immortal weapon!”

“We Huan Tian Island promise: whoever bids successfully, we’ll connect them with Master Lu Chong to attach the string!” The senior smiled again, knowing this bow would cause a frenzy.

“Starting price: thirty million spirit stones! Each bid must be at least one million!” The senior announced the auction began, and people erupted in noise.

“Three million five hundred thousand!” Chang Ziyang shouted, his voice full of determination. He knew fighting for the dragon egg was impossible now.

“Three million seven hundred thousand!” Huang Youshan also shouted, eyes challenging Ye Liangchen.

“Four million…” Ye Liangchen spoke loudly, raising the bid. He had enough spirit stones and knew Luo Tian would help him. This Bow of Shooting the Sun, Ye Liangchen estimated, was about eight million. He could definitely get it with Luo Tian’s one billion.

As for the dragon egg, Ye Liangchen was confident his father’s spirit stones were enough!

This time, not only did Ye Liangchen and Huang Youshan bid, but other纨绔 also kept speaking. The scene became intense.

“Six million… seven million…” Soon, the price soared to Ye Liangchen’s target of eight million. Yet several纨绔 didn’t stop.

“Relying on sects is good!” Luo Tian watched the纨绔 spend money like water, his face showing admiration. He looked at Huang Youshan; he hadn’t competed for the Man Shen Zhan Ge, but had thought of a way to get it cheaply.

“Ten million!” Ye Liangchen gritted his teeth, staring at everyone. This was his limit; he couldn’t spend the remaining spirit stones.

“Eleven million! Who dares challenge me!” Huang Youshan’s eyes were bloodshot, staring at everyone. He had gambled everything; the dragon egg was no longer his. According to Huang Youshan, their sect had suitable materials for the string. If attached, it would become a top-grade weapon worth several times more than the dragon egg!

Hearing Huang Youshan’s bid, everyone was stunned. The auction hall fell silent; all eyes turned to Huang Youshan.

“Thirteen million!” As people were shocked, Luo Tian spoke loudly, giving his maximum bid.

“Damn it!” Huang Youshan’s face was grim. He had brought sixteen million spirit stones, but spent much already and lost two million four hundred thousand on the Man Shen Zhan Ge. Now he had only twelve million eight hundred thousand left.

Hearing Luo Tian’s bid, people gasped again, eyes on Luo Tian.

“What to do?” Huang Youshan’s face was grim. At this moment, he had already planned to kill Luo Tian. He had wanted to kill him before; now his hatred for Luo Tian was at its peak.

“Ha ha! Huang Youshan, do you want this bow?” Luo Tian smiled, ignoring Huang Youshan’s murderous gaze. He asked.

“What do you want?” Huang Youshan gritted his teeth, staring at Luo Tian. At this moment, the senior had already dropped the hammer, announcing Luo Tian’s bid. If it rang three times, this bow would belong to Luo Tian.

“Five hundred thousand spirit stones. Sell me that scroll and I won’t compete for the Bow of Shooting the Sun!” Luo Tian looked at Huang Youshan, smiling.
