"Peerless great evil swords have finally clashed!" Most people's faces bore anticipation as they watched Luo Tian and Ye Qiu flying backward.

"Longyuan ranks third, Jueyun fourth. Though one rank apart, the Seven Great Evil Swords each possess unique characteristics; rankings are merely sequential."

"Strong!" Ye Qiu's body darted back, his gaze locking onto Luo Tian across from him. Though their clash was brief and Luo Tian's prior victories were renowned, after clashing with Luo Tian, Ye Qiu instinctively sensed the immense pressure emanating from him—far more complex than it appeared.

"Again!" Luo Tian's face bore a faint smile, equally sensing Ye Qiu's strength. Rarely had he encountered an opponent who could challenge him.

"Kill..." Instantly, Luo Tian and Ye Qiu lunged at each other again, their peerless great evil swords slicing through the air with relentless force. Though initially evenly matched, those who observed noticed Luo Tian held a slight advantage. Longyuan's weight and Luo Tian's formidable flesh granted him an edge, each clash causing Ye Qiu's hands to tremble.

"Buzz..." Ye Qiu finally could not contain his impatience. His body flickered out of sight, Jueyun's blade expanding with a sky-splitting might, carving through the blackened heavens toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's face remained calm as he vanished, his body merging with Longyuan, which also surged forth to clash against Jueyun.

The collision roared skyward, shaking the heavens. The swords' illusions dissipated from view as Luo Tian and Ye Qiu reappeared before the onlookers.

"Luo Chen's disciple has blocked Ye Qiu's attack!" The disciples of the Wheel Turning Hall cheered, watching Luo Tian charge again toward Ye Qiu.

"Go..." Both men spoke in unison, extending their hands. Their long swords flew from their grasp.

One black, one white—opposite extremes—colliding above their heads. Luo Tian and Ye Qiu clashed in the second stage of sword Dao, where "man is man, blade is blade."

Boom after boom... Without restraining Longyuan, Luo Tian was terrifying—his entire body a living weapon, fists flashing around him.

Even more fearsome was that any True Immortal would be suppressed by Luo Tian's ultimate stage, including Ye Qiu.

This time, Ye Qiu spat blood repeatedly, his body retreating with disbelief. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to have reached such an abnormally powerful level, even being crushed so severely by him.

"Competing with him in flesh is suicide!" Ye Qiu finally understood Luo Tian's strength, as a punch to his chest sent him flying.

"Indeed an abomination—he has made Ye Qiu spit blood!"

"Though Ye Qiu isn't skilled in flesh, his body is still formidable!"

"Man falls, sword does not!" Luo Tian watched the Jueyun clashing with Longyuan above, breaking free from its attack's range to return to Ye Qiu's hand. Ye Qiu's face regained confidence.

"Have you entered the third stage yet?" Ye Qiu smiled, Jueyun flashing with divine radiance. After a flicker of light, Ye Qiu and his sword vanished from view.

"Ah?" Luo Tian's brows lifted. Seeing Ye Qiu disappear, he extended his vast spiritual awareness but found no trace of him.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian pondered, a wave of energy rose behind him—a formless sword piercing his back.

Luo Tian's face slightly changed. He felt a whisper of wind but no trace of Jueyun.

"Boom..." Without hesitation, Luo Tian turned and struck the source of the disturbance. Blood gushed from his waist, a deep wound appearing on his side, making him grimace.

"Terrifying—Ye Qiu has mastered the third stage of sword Dao, 'no self, no blade'!" The crowd murmured, resuming their watch. This time, Luo Tian fell behind.

In the first hall of the Wheel Turning Hall, ten masters sat, their faces filled with admiration.

"This boy's sword Dao talent is truly high—mastering the third stage. I didn't know!" An elder of the Fendu Hall spoke, his eyes showing satisfaction.

"Yet Luo Chen is no pushover!" Several masters also watched the match with interest.

"Who do you think it is? The one favored by fate, a reincarnation son—how could he be wrong! Fortunately, I tampered with this boy's mask earlier; otherwise it would have been hard to pass through. If these old masters knew this boy was a reincarnation son, they'd go mad!" The White and Black Huns thought to themselves.

"The state of 'no self, no blade' plus Jueyun's ethereal nature is perfect for the third stage of sword Dao," one master remarked.

"Pu..." As the masters discussed, Luo Tian already bore ten wounds, bleeding profusely.

"Merely the third stage of sword Dao—do you think it can overwhelm me? You're dreaming. I haven't reached the third stage yet, but my movement techniques can compensate for my sword Dao's level!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with confidence. His feet sent waves of energy, and his body vanished from view.

"Both have disappeared!" The disciples of the Wheel Turning Hall gasped, unable to find Luo Tian and Ye Qiu's forms.

"You don't come out, I won't either. Let's see who can endure longer..." Luo Tian resolved in his mind, concealing his form.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian pondered, a cold glint appeared on his movement path, adding another bloodstain to his body. Had he not reacted quickly, he would have been severed at the waist.

"How is this possible!" Luo Tian was stunned, disbelieving his own Yellow Spring Steps had been discovered. Even a True Immortal peak would find it hard to detect, let alone Ye Qiu.

Yet Ye Qiu gave no chance for Luo Tian to think. The second strike came, slicing Luo Tian's shoulder, making him realize it wasn't luck—Ye Qiu had truly detected him.

"Why?" Luo Tian halted, his wounds radiating coldness. His gaze was cautious as he scanned around, spiritual awareness already spread.

"Eyes!" Soon, Luo Tian noticed the anomaly—Baiming's one eye was closed, while a pure white sun had appeared in the sky.

"It must be because of Baiming!"

"Seems Mo Tian's state isn't good now," Luo Tian thought, watching the still-standing Mo Tian.

Baiming still had strength to fight him—meaning Mo Tian hadn't fully restrained Baiming.

Meanwhile, Qiu Long fought a large man with bloodied bodies, their punches striking flesh. Wang Gang's situation wasn't much better; his opponent always held a sword.

"The situation is getting dire," Luo Tian leapt up, dodging Ye Qiu's attack while thinking of a way to break the deadlock.

Chapter 2187: The Six Sacred Curses

On the battlefield, Luo Tian stood still, his gaze scanning around. A pure white eye hovered on the platform, as if凝聚 by heaven itself, watching Luo Tian and others.

Luo Tian stood still, his gaze scanning around. He felt Wang Gang's disadvantage; if this continued, the match might end.

"Buzz..." A sword image appeared. Jueyun reappeared at Luo Tian's side, piercing toward him.

"First deal with the eye in the sky; otherwise we'll be passive!" Luo Tian grabbed for Jueyun, which was approaching him.

"Suicide! How dare you grab Jueyun with your hands!" The watching elders gasped. Before their words finished, Luo Tian's hand had already gripped Jueyun.

Cold energy spread through Luo Tian's arms, covering his body. Under the astonished gazes of the crowd, Jueyun was about to pierce Luo Tian's heart when it stopped.

Blood stained the blade. Luo Tian's arms bulged with veins, and Ye Qiu appeared in his vision, shocked.

"Caught it! Luo Chen has grabbed Jueyun!" Everyone gasped in astonishment.

"Die!" Luo Tian roared, his other fist suddenly swung. Three shadow fists smashed through the void, crashing into Ye Qiu's chest.

"Boom..." A heavy sound echoed across the battlefield. Ye Qiu spat blood, but his body didn't fly back—he clutched Jueyun with one hand.

"Buzz..." Jueyun erupted with boundless divine light. Waves of sword energy burst forth, forming a storm that swept toward Luo Tian.

Puff puff puff... Sword glints swept over Luo Tian's body, multiple wounds appearing. In an instant, Luo Tian became a bloodied man.

"Capture Jueyun and force Ye Qiu to reveal himself!"

"If not, under the幽冥 eye's gaze, Luo Chen's movement techniques would be useless. But Ye Qiu could constantly attack with the third stage of sword Dao!" People immediately understood Luo Tian's intention.

"But can he endure it? Each sword energy from Jueyun could harm him. Even with his abnormal flesh, he couldn't withstand it!" Wang Lie's face showed worry as he watched Luo Tian at the center of the sword storm.

"It is somewhat uncomfortable, but I want to see how many punches you can endure. If three times flesh power isn't enough, then four!" Luo Tian smirked internally, raising his fist again.

Luo Tian endured sword energy sweeping at every moment. If not for his formidable recovery power, he would have been pierced by a thousand swords.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian raised his fist, Ye Qiu's face slightly changed. He felt a strong crisis.

"Don't let go—I want to see what you're capable of!" Ye Qiu gritted his teeth, unwilling to surrender. His body emitted waves of energy, his cultivation rapidly circulating through his body. True Immortal power transformed into a gossamer robe covering Ye Qiu's form.

Though thin, the robe contained immense power, as if possessing terrifying defense.

"Golden Immortal Gossamer Robe!" The crowd gasped again, watching the black robe and exclaiming.

"A Great Luo Immortal! Ye Qiu is a Great Luo Immortal, no less than the Ultimate Stage!"

"At the Heavenly Immortal stage, one can cultivate ghost energy or immortal energy. At its peak, entering the Heavenly Immortal stage is the Ultimate Stage. But at True Immortal stage, it's not the Ultimate Stage but a Great Luo Immortal!" A half-Immortal King of the Wheel Turning Hall spoke softly.

"Unexpectedly, Luo Chen is at the Ultimate Stage, and Ye Qiu is no less than a Great Luo Immortal!" Everyone looked at Ye Qiu with awe.

"These two's battle is truly magnificent!"

"Both wielding the Seven Great Evil Swords, both at their peak!" People's faces bore anticipation. This battle would be etched into the Ten Halls of Yama, becoming a classic.

"Which is stronger—Ultimate Stage or Great Luo Immortal!" Everyone's eyes were fixed on Luo Tian and Ye Qiu, including the ten hall masters, their gazes filled with curiosity.

"Boom... Boom..." The heavens darkened, winds reversed. A fist image from Luo Tian's hand was thrown, and before it landed, another followed.

"Third... Fourth..." Four fist images, each carrying immense power. The four fists merged, causing the world to tremble as they landed on Ye Qiu's body.

"Disperse!" Invisible waves of energy radiated from Luo Tian, one punch landing and the world collapsing. The terrifying sword energies were directly smashed by Luo Tian's fist.

"Four times flesh power!" Everyone's faces showed shock, especially Fan Tianyin and Yi Jianren. They had fought Luo Tian before and knew his fist's power—three fists had already left them unable to fight back.

It was indeed four times flesh power. During the Demon Mirror's time, Luo Tian's speed had improved, deepening his understanding of speed. Thus, his chaotic punches had also advanced greatly.

"Fight with me and he didn't use his full strength! What kind of monster is he!" Fan Tianyin's mind was shaken.

"Crack..." Under everyone's shocked gazes, Ye Qiu's gossamer robe shattered into a surge of energy sweeping eight directions. Luo Tian's fist solidly struck Ye Qiu's body.

Two cracks echoed, Ye Qiu spat blood. Blood splattered on Luo Tian's face. Ye Qiu finally couldn't endure, his body flying backward.

"Boom..." Ye Qiu's chest caved in. His body fell to the ground, his gaze showing weakness. Luo Tian's punch was terrifying—four times flesh power. If it were a True Immortal peak, he would have been smashed into pieces. Ye Qiu was only severely wounded because of the Golden Immortal Gossamer Robe's protection.

"Buzz..." Jueyun trembled violently in Luo Tian's hand, trying to break free. Luo Tian also couldn't bear it and let Jueyun escape from his grasp.

"Very painful!" Luo Tian looked at the deep wound on his palm. If it lasted longer, this hand would be ruined. His gaze turned to Ye Qiu on the ground but didn't chase him. Instead, he took out the Shouri Bow and Mieshen Arrow, slowly drawing it back. Flowing light flashed, golden divine radiance flying toward the white eye in the sky.

"They've all done this to destroy the幽冥 eye!" People understood immediately. Luo Tian's every action was aimed at eliminating the eye in the sky.

"Because of this eye, not only Luo Tian but also Wang Gang and Qiu Long would be in trouble!" Hunyuan Zun said softly.

Mieshen Arrow's speed was unparalleled. Yet, as it pierced the幽冥 eye in the sky, that eye suddenly vanished.

At the same time, Baiming opened his closed eye. However, this eye had become somewhat murky. The world darkened again.

"Night Devour!" As Baiming opened his eyes, Mo Tian roared, seizing the opportunity. His two pupils merged, waves of energy surrounding Baiming.

"Damn!" Baiming's body trembled. He cursed, and another幽冥 eye burst with divine light.

But it was too late. Baiming felt as if he had entered another space, with endless heavenly fire descending to engulf him.

"Who dares underestimate me!" Mo Tian spat blood, his eyes streaming tears. He panted heavily.

"Mo Tian has also improved!" Luo Tian watched Mo Tian panting, his eyes showing a faint smile. But he quickly suppressed it because a powerful pressure swept over his mind.

"Buzz..." Wind surged, white sword clouds covering the heavens, sweeping toward Luo Tian's direction.

"Sword Cloud?" Luo Tian's eyes immediately showed understanding. He looked at the sword cloud and Ye Qiu standing nearby.

"Since your flesh isn't a match, use techniques!" Ye Qiu spoke softly. His chest had already recovered. He extended his hand and pressed into the void.

The void became chaotic, waves of sword energy descending like an endless rain toward Luo Tian.

"Still not enough!" Luo Tian smiled, holding Longyuan in one hand and taking out the Zhenxian Brush with the other. Both hands unleashed power.

"兵临斗者皆阵列..." Each character danced from Luo Tian's hand, each carrying supreme heavenly authority.

Meanwhile, Longyuan radiated brilliant light. Its massive sword energy split the heavens and earth, slicing toward the sword cloud.

Boom after boom... Seven characters suppressed the heavens. The descending waves of sword energy continuously disintegrated under the seven characters, which collided with the sword cloud. The thunderous sound was overwhelming.

After seven booms, the sword cloud turned into chaos. Overwhelming sword light cut through the chaos, turning the sword cloud directly into a gust of energy sweeping within the barrier.

"Six Sacred Curses!" Ye Qiu roared. His aura surged again, waves of sword energy forming seals on his body, finally covering him entirely.

"Secret technique of the Fendu Hall!" Everyone's faces showed shock, watching Ye Qiu covered in sword energy seals.

"Only by forcing Ye Qiu to use his secret technique is he the second!" The young man fighting Wang Gang showed shock, looking at Ye Qiu's overwhelming aura.

"Crack..." Six seal sword energies danced on Ye Qiu's body. A crack echoed from his body, and Ye Qiu's aura suddenly stopped at the True Immortal peak!

"The Six Sacred Curses have all been unleashed!" Everyone was shocked, looking at Ye Qiu standing there.

"Among contemporaries, few can fully unleash this hall's secret technique!" Fan Tianyin and others felt bitter.

"Ye Qiu, you are indeed my opponent. A simple Wheel Turning Hall cannot block you!" On the ground, a young man smiled. This was Wang Xiu, the disciple of the Shura Hall.

Chapter 2188: Six Paths Reincarnation Sword

"True Immortal peak?" Luo Tian's eyes slightly narrowed, gazing at Ye Qiu standing there. Though common techniques to enhance strength were somewhat hollow, with Ye Qiu's methods, reaching True Immortal peak naturally surpassed a regular True Immortal peak.

"Open!" Ye Qiu's face again showed confidence. Feeling his strength, he pointed at Luo Tian.

A single finger fell, sending a powerful wave from Ye Qiu's fingertip. An invisible sword energy pierced through the void, flying toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian grabbed with his hand. A thunderous sound echoed as a black sword blocked the invisible sword energy's tip.

Luo Tian turned his body, and the invisible sword energy continuously wore down before him. A divine pattern rose beneath his feet, and he retreated a hundred paces before stopping.

"Now, what do you have left to fight me with?" Ye Qiu stood in the sky like a god, his gaze overwhelming as he looked at Luo Tian.

"Those from Fendu Hall talk too much!" Luo Tian smiled, catching his breath and looking at Ye Qiu.

Luo Tian's hands formed seals. A series of black hand patterns flew from his hands, imprinting on his body.

Boom after boom... Luo Tian's body immediately emitted a series of thunderous sounds. One hundred and eight whirlwinds erupted from his body, and his aura continuously rose.

"What is this?" People showed confusion, watching Luo Tian before their minds trembled.

"Earth Store King, Hundred Ghosts Sealing!" Shouguiwang spoke softly, his eyes showing surprise.

"It's definitely correct. It's the Hundred Ghosts Sealing of the Earth Store King. This guy's inheritance appeared before in Kanmen!"

But Shouguiwang still believed Luo Tian was backed by at least a late-stage Immortal King. Otherwise, just the Earth Store King's inheritance wouldn't be enough!

Black True Immortal energy covered Luo Tian's entire body. Dense black mist obscured his form. Waves of energy surged, and Luo Tian stood on the battlefield like a demon. Though he hadn't fully reached True Immortal peak, it was enough for Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." Ye Qiu's eyes slightly narrowed. Seeing Luo Tian hadn't reached True Immortal peak, his eyes flickered again. In his view, as long as Luo Tian didn't enter True Immortal peak, there was no problem.

With Jueyun in hand, terrifying waves of energy rose again from Ye Qiu. Thunderous sounds echoed as he wielded Jueyun, sending waves of powerful sword energy. This time it wasn't a sword cloud but six sword energies, each carrying a wave that could change the heavens.

"Roar..." A roar echoed. The six sword glints resembled six massive ghosts, containing immense power, as if they could devour all things in the world.

"Six Paths Reincarnation Sword!" Wang Xiu exclaimed, watching the six sword glints hovering above Ye Qiu's head.

"Using the power of the Six Paths Reincarnation to condense sword energy!" People gasped, watching Ye Qiu in the sky with expressions of disbelief.

Luo Tian's eyes slightly moved. His hands quickly changed, and a roar echoed from his hands.

Black energy surged. Four dragons and four tigers hovered above Luo Tian's head—this was the Dragon and Tiger Sealing Prison given by Longque.

As the four dragons and tigers rose, the six sword energies trembled slightly, causing Ye Qiu to feel a shock.

The Six Paths Reincarnation Sword was his killing technique. Using True Immortal peak strength, it was terrifyingly invincible, having slain many enemies. The Six Paths Reincarnation power could suppress True Immortal energy. Yet Ye Qiu hadn't expected Luo Tian's four dragons and tigers to make the six sword energies tremble.

"Suppress!"

"Destroy!" Luo Tian and Ye Qiu spoke simultaneously. The six massive sword energies spun, rushing toward Luo Tian.

"Boom..." Four huge ghost tigers descended, stomping toward the six spinning sword energies. Four long dragons roared and rushed toward the sword energy. The thunderous sound echoed across eight directions. In an instant, a massive collision resounded within the barrier, with boundless black energy sweeping through the three kings' formed domain barrier.

The barrier continuously trembled. A destructive wave spread from where their techniques collided. Shouguiwang pressed his hands, stabilizing the wobbling domain and the cracked battlefield.

Almost immediately after the collision, Mo Tian formed a barrier with his hands to protect himself.

Without Mo Tian's restraint, Baiming also broke free from the illusion. He panted heavily.

"Disperse!" Baiming roared, his eyes regaining their light. The waves before him twisted instantly. Terrorizing waves blew the fighting Qiu Long and the large man, sending them flying and spitting blood onto the ground. Wang Gang also stopped immediately to resist the powerful waves.

Dust swept, vast voids exploded, and澎湃 black energy obscured people's vision. After dozens of breaths, it gradually calmed down, and people saw the scene within the barrier. Their eyes showed shock.

At this moment, the battlefield was in ruins. Qiu Long and the large man lay on the ground, their backs' clothes gone, with wounds appearing on their backs.

"Was it necessary to involve us?" The large man grinned as he stood up, panting heavily.

As the large man rose, another piece of clothing fell off. The large man felt a chill and quickly took out a piece of clothing to wear.

Baiming and Mo Tian weren't much better, both in disarray. Their gazes showed admiration as they watched Ye Qiu recondensing sword energy.

"It seems the Holy Son has some pressure. I need to finish you quickly!" Baiming sighed, his eyes now restored. He looked at Mo Tian across from him.

"You're still strong. That illusion almost trapped me!" Baiming smiled, his white eyes again radiating waves of divine light. He then started moving his hands.

"Earlier was just a warm-up. Now it's serious!" Mo Tian wiped the dried blood from his eyes, speaking softly.

"Yanming!" His hands flipped, black energy flying out. A black seal hovered above Baiming's head. Terrorizing waves made Mo Tian's eyes show intense light. His hands also flipped, observing Baiming's seals.

"Boom... Boom..." Surging black energy rose. A massive coffin floated in the black energy—this was the divine treasure once used by Yang Huanyu.

Mo Tian had lost one eye in the Reincarnation Realm, and he'd always remembered it. But Mo Tian hadn't been without gain; he had finally replicated Yang Huanyu's divine treasure.

Meanwhile, Qiu Long changed clothes and stood up. His gaze turned to the large man across from him.

"Kid, you're pretty good. I'm Chen Xiong; call me Old Bear. After this battle, we can be friends!" The large man spoke to Qiu Long.

"But I won't hold back next!" The large man's tone shifted. His body radiated fierce energy, rushing toward Qiu Long.

"Better to die than be a burden!" Qiu Long laughed, his aura rising. He rushed toward Chen Xiong as well.

Wang Gang's opponent also began attacking him fiercely. Wang Gang constantly defended, gradually feeling immense pressure.

Ye Qiu held Jueyun, gazing at Luo Tian. His sword glinted again. His body flickered, emitting waves of residual images. In an instant, he became six figures, each resembling a true form.

"This time, it's six. Let's end this!" Ye Qiu's face was pale. The six figures struck waves of sword energy, launching the Six Paths Reincarnation Sword again.

"Indeed it's time to end!" Luo Tian panted, feeling immense pressure. He watched the six Ye Qius strike the Six Paths Reincarnation Sword.

"Buzz..." Waves of energy spread from Luo Tian's hands. He tightly gripped Longyuan, its sword energy piercing the heavens. Divine essence flowed on Longyuan, a powerful pressure sweeping over. Eight ghost veins surged with True Immortal energy into Longyuan, its power sweeping.

"One... two..." Luo Tian's cultivation rapidly drained. His aura began to decrease.

"Six Paths Reincarnation!" Ye Qiu roared. This time, six sword arrays descended upon Luo Tian.

"One strike!"

"Linxian!" Luo Tian spoke softly. His cultivation was drained by eight times, his sword intent terrifyingly sky-high. A piercing hum rose from Luo Tian's hands. A black great sword severed the heavens, carrying infinite divine might as it sliced toward the six sword arrays.

Shouguiwang and three others' eyes flickered. They simultaneously used their techniques to form barriers, isolating Mo Tian, Qiu Long's battle areas.

The black sword glint collided with the six sword arrays. The world thundered.

"It's time to decide the victor!" Everyone's faces showed shock, watching the barrier. Even through the barrier, they could feel the terrifying power of their sword techniques. Even half-Immortal Kings' elders showed solemnity.

The black great sword continuously clashed with the sword array, showing a mutual match.

"Eight Directions' Treasure!" Luo Tian's hands grabbed, invisible waves flying from his hands. The great sword that had clashed with the six arrays surged again, finally gaining an advantage.

"Crack... Crack..." Each white sword glint shattered under the black great sword. With each shatter, Ye Qiu spat blood.

Luo Tian's face grew paler, but his eyes showed a smile. He watched the sword array shatter under one strike of Linxian.

The black great sword lost its divine essence but remained terrifying, slicing toward Ye Qiu.

Chapter 2190: Baiming

On the battlefield, Luo Tian sat cross-legged, his eyes closed. His body emitted a strong suction, absorbing thin ghost energy to recover.

Meanwhile, two battlefields were fierce and chaotic. Qiu Long and Chen Xiong had fallen to the ground, no longer rising. Both panted heavily, their gazes locking as they began to recover.

"Boom... Boom..." A large hand emerged from the void, grabbing a black ghost creature and crushing it. Waves swept over Wang Gang's body. As if in a chain reaction, three other ghost creatures around him also shattered, causing Wang Gang to spit blood.

"Buzz..." After crushing four ghost creatures, the black hand clenched into a fist, rushing toward Wang Gang.

"Finished! Wang Senior can't withstand it!" The disciples of the Wheel Turning Hall gasped, their voices filled with anxiety.

"Ultimately, he's still a bit lacking. Luo Chen defeating Ye Qiu was already surprising. But those three teammates—also injured one who excels in close combat, Chen Xiong. However, Baiming's Longkong isn't easy to match evenly!" Other halls' geniuses watched Luo Tian seated, sighing deeply.

"Yet, to force the Fendu Hall this far, the Wheel Turning Hall's strength is already top-tier. If we assess combat power alone, Luo Chen's strength could become the first among the ten halls because no one has ever defeated Ye Qiu!"

"Wang Xiu once fought Ye Qiu, ending in a draw. But both didn't reveal their secret techniques!" The disciples of the other halls whispered, eyes filled with admiration. Luo Chen's name would become a topic among the ten halls' disciples for a long time.

"Open!" Wang Gang roared, watching the earth-shaking black fist. His eyes showed madness.

Qiu Long had matched Chen Xiong evenly. How could he not? Though he admitted he wasn't as strong as Luo Tian, if he was surpassed by Qiu Long, it would be too embarrassing. Genius, how many were not proud?

Meanwhile, people were surprised that Mo Tian and Baiming were evenly matched. Though Mo Tian had lost one eye, his divine treasure was formidable—this black coffin could attack and defend.

"This Mo Tian isn't simple. The Moon Eclipse Eye, indeed magical. Did you see? Many of Mo Tian's techniques were Baiming's!" People showed curiosity. Though Mo Tian's name was known, the second unexpected hero was Mo Tian.

Baiming's strength wasn't inferior to a hall's disciple. But Mo Tian could match him, though slightly disadvantaged. To reach this point was already equivalent to a disciple's strength.

Time passed slowly. An hour had passed, Wang Gang spat blood repeatedly, his body trembling as if about to collapse.

The black fist continuously fell, one punch after another pressing toward Wang Gang without giving him a chance to fight back.

"Give up! If you continue like this, you'll die!" Longkong stood dozens of feet away from Wang Gang, watching the mountain-like fist pressing down.

"Impossible!" Wang Gang's face was pale. He endured another punch, his body falling to the ground but struggling to rise.

"Then stay here. I'll go find that kid!" Longkong smiled, knowing Wang Gang had no offensive ability left. He directly stepped toward Luo Tian's direction and continuously formed seals. The sky above Luo Tian cracked open, a black hand凝聚 again, rushing toward him.

"Luo Chen's defeat ends it!" People watched the black hand pressing down, their eyes filled with admiration for Luo Tian.

"It's not over yet. Your opponent is me!" Just as the hand descended, about to press on Luo Tian's body, Wang Gang's voice echoed in their ears. Though the voice wasn't loud, it was unusually resolute.

Light flashed. A streak of light instantly appeared under the black hand. His body carried a desperate aura, hands lifting the sky. This figure was Wang Gang!

"Boom..." The next moment, the black hand pressed onto Wang Gang's arms. A crack echoed from his arms, cracks spreading and gradually moving toward his entire body.

"Why such hardship..." Longkong watched Wang Gang crushed by the hand, knowing he would be shattered.

"Block it!" Wang Gang continuously roared. His hands held the black hand, his body constantly descending. He could feel the pressure from the hand would definitely crush him now injured, but Wang Gang wouldn't give up or surrender.

"Roar..." Roaring sounds echoed. Continuous roars, then tiger cries, followed by ape cries... A series of beast roars continuously echoed. Wang Gang's shattered body began to heal slowly, blood containing divine essence.

"Beast King Bloodline!" Shouguiwang's face showed joy, watching Wang Gang stabilize his body. His aura continuously increased.

"Brother, he's awakened the Beast King Bloodline!" Wang Lie's face also showed joy, unable to help exclaiming.

"Boom..." As Wang Gang continuously roared and his aura increased, the black hand emitted cracks. After a moment, it shattered above Wang Gang's head.

Black energy surged, residual waves sweeping outward. Wang Gang's body also landed on the ground, panting heavily. His body echoed with the sound of a hundred beasts roaring.

Eight Great Kings, including the Earth Store King, flowed with ancient bloodlines. This was why the kings could exist. Awakening a king's bloodline would greatly enhance one's strength, no less than these disciples.

"Awakened the flowing bloodline power?" Longkong's brows slightly furrowed, watching Wang Gang with unstable aura. According to reason, awakening a bloodline shouldn't disturb the opponent.
