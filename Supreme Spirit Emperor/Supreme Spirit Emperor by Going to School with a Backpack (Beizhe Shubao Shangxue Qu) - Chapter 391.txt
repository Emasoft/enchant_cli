“Alas…” However, Luo Tian let out a long sigh within himself. Though he had grasped the upper half of the Revitalization Scripture, Luo Tian knew that this scripture, though equally transcendent, was no different from the Ten Thousand Life Generation Scripture in terms of its ability to stimulate growth; their rates of cultivation were nearly identical.

“One cannot waste this insight!” Luo Tian mused within himself, extending a hand to point forward. A resonant hum echoed once more from his palm, and the Xuanshuang Lotus (Frost-White Lotus) began to sprout its sixth bloom.

As the lotus continued to grow, Luo Tian pondered how to accelerate his progress. After all, at his current pace, he would never cultivate three sacred herbs within half a year.

“The Ten Thousand Life Generation Scripture and the Revitalization Scripture both stimulate growth at the same rate, yet their principles differ!” Luo Tian mused repeatedly.

“The Ten Thousand Life Generation Scripture directly converts one’s cultivation into growth energy, whereas the Revitalization Scripture is far gentler. What if these two techniques were fused? What effect would that yield?” Luo Tian’s eyes gradually brightened.

Seven days passed in the blink of an eye, and the Xuanshuang Lotus bore its sixth seed. Luo Tian again sat cross-legged in midair, his brow furrowed. Yet no swirling vortex of energy appeared above his head as it had after previous growths.

“Hmph?” Observing Luo Tian’s calm demeanor instead of his usual urgency, Long Xiao felt a flicker of confusion.

“Though his pace is insufficient, if he exerted himself fully, success might still be possible. Why has he suddenly abandoned the effort?” Long Xiao’s gaze held bewilderment, unsure of what Luo Tian was contemplating.

At that moment, Luo Tian was engrossed in meticulous calculations, fusing the two techniques. This endeavor demanded absolute focus; he dared not risk failure, for no one in history—not even the Epoch Lords—had ever attempted such a feat.

“Not… no…” Repeatedly refining his calculations, Luo Tian sought to merge the two techniques as thoroughly as possible. Yet it proved impossibly difficult; even a slight miscalculation would render the attempt futile.

“Circulate through the Great Meridian, merge into the丹田 (Dantian)!” As time passed, seven days elapsed before Luo Tian finally opened his eyes. He tentatively fused the two techniques together.

“Hum…” A resonant hum reverberated, and a swirling vortex of energy rose above Luo Tian’s head. A torrent of power cascaded downward, flooding his body.

“What was he doing for those seven days? He’s lost seven days—time is surely insufficient!” Long Xiao, his face etched with confusion, gazed at Luo Tian as he recovered.

A day passed, and Luo Tian rose slowly, his gaze heavy with resolve. He approached the Xuanshuang Lotus, now bearing six seeds.

“Youth,” Long Xiao remarked, “if you had exerted yourself from the start, time would have sufficed. Yet you wasted seven days—time is now insufficient!”

“Master, you deemed the first trial insurmountable. Yet I still passed it,” Luo Tian replied softly, then extended a hand. A pristine seal emerged from his fingers, glowing with warmth and radiating white light like a beam of sunlight. It surged toward the Xuanshuang Lotus.

“What is this?” Long Xiao’s expression turned puzzled; he recognized neither the Ten Thousand Life Generation Scripture nor the Revitalization Scripture.

“Could it be…” His eyes widened in disbelief, locking onto Luo Tian.

“Crack… crack…” A freezing sound echoed as the marsh beneath them began to solidify rapidly, spreading outward. The chill emanated from the Xuanshuang Lotus Luo Tian was cultivating.

In an instant, under Long Xiao’s stunned gaze, the lotus sprouted at a breathtaking speed.

“How is this possible!” Long Xiao gasped, his eyes alight with disbelief, as if witnessing a miracle.

“Success!” Luo Tian’s face broke into a rare smile. The lotus now grew at more than double the speed of either scripture alone.

Under Luo Tian and Long Xiao’s watchful eyes, the lotus bloomed within half a day. It withered swiftly, and a crystalline seed began to coalesce. Doubtless, it would fully form within another half-day.

“Crack…” As Luo Tian’s face lit up with joy, the sound of a crack echoed in his ears. His expression darkened abruptly.

“Youth, do not overreach. Even my master never conceived of such a feat,” Long Xiao said with a smile, addressing Luo Tian.

The lotus leaves, thick with frost, cracked one by one, deepening Luo Tian’s frown.

“Ruined! You’ve lost all hope now. This month’s efforts were in vain, and you’ve wasted a Xuanshuang Lotus!” Long Xiao sneered, dismissing Luo Tian as overly arrogant for attempting to merge two techniques.

“Master, until time runs out, do not hastily conclude,” Luo Tian replied softly, his voice resolute. Though the attempt had failed, he still glimpsed a sliver of success.

“Very well,” Long Xiao smirked. “I shall watch how you succeed. Regardless, your time is wasted—I won’t stop you. I’m bored anyway; watching a spectacle suits me.” He remained, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

“Something is amiss,” Luo Tian sat cross-legged again, no longer frantic. As Long Xiao had said, even if he now exerted himself fully, time was insufficient.

“Why did it fail at the end? It had worked before,” Luo Tian mused, frowning.

“There was no flaw in the calculations—everything seemed perfect!” Luo Tian replayed his deductions repeatedly.

“Great cultivators create scriptures, yet you seek to merge two into one—this is folly,” Long Xiao remarked.

“Master, your words are hasty. Paths are forged by those who walk them. And I have already achieved part of the success, yes?” Luo Tian countered before resuming his endless calculations.

“Creation!” Yet Long Xiao’s words stirred something in Luo Tian, recalling Gu Tianxiu’s earlier advice.

“Walk your own path!” Luo Tian murmured, his mind replaying the two scriptures’ flow. He infused them with his own ideas rather than rigidly fusing them.

“Let’s try…” Luo Tian seemed to enter a frenzy, his eyes burning with determination. He rose and pointed at a random herb, initiating cultivation.

“Boom…” Yet after half a day, the herb exploded into a surge of vitality, vanishing from Luo Tian’s sight.

“Something is off,” Luo Tian remained undeterred, refining his approach and integrating his insights.

“One day… two days…” Time passed swiftly, and soon it had been two months since Luo Tian entered this realm.

“Boom… boom… boom…” Herbs continued to burst under his cultivation, either crumbling into powder or withering outright.

“His perseverance is truly admirable,” Long Xiao observed Luo Tian’s relentless efforts, his gaze shifting.

“Give up—this path leads to a dead end. Just as I once sought to forge an immortal elixir, I too failed after countless calculations,” Long Xiao urged.

Yet Luo Tian ignored him, rising again to point at a herb. A soft glow emanated from his fingers, enveloping the plant.

The herb was but a common Windgrass; under Luo Tian’s influence, it sprouted violently. A rustling wind echoed through its leaves.

“One inch… two inches…” The ordinary herb grew to a towering height, the maximum it could reach. Yet Luo Tian’s glow persisted, still enveloping the now-still Windgrass.

A resonant hum echoed from the plant as its verdant glow deepened, radiating vitality. Under Long Xiao’s gaze, it gradually turned golden.

Once the entire Windgrass glowed gold, Luo Tian’s eyes softened. He let out a triumphant laugh that shook the heavens.

“Ha!” His laughter echoed, shaking the world.

“This is a fully matured Windgrass, golden throughout, with wind sounds!” Long Xiao’s eyes widened in disbelief, staring at Luo Tian.

“By all means, he succeeded! My heavens—what is this youth’s origin? How could such a feat be achieved!” Long Xiao was overwhelmed. No Epoch Lord had ever attempted this, yet this youth had done so.

Luo Tian, seeing Long Xiao’s awe, felt a flicker of pride. After all, merging two scriptures had never been achieved in history.

“Let’s call it the Ten Thousand Revitalization Scripture,” Luo Tian smiled, leaping into the air. He reappeared above the marsh where he had first appeared, extending a hand. A soft glow emerged from his palm, enveloping a Xuanshuang Lotus and resuming cultivation.

The lotus trembled, its leaves sprouting anew. Within a day, it matured into a blooming flower, visible to both Luo Tian and Long Xiao.

The pink lotus unfurled before withering swiftly, yet it took only a day. The next morning, under the sun’s rays, an ice-like seed coalesced, glowing radiantly. The marsh beneath them began to freeze gradually.

Another day passed, and the crystalline seed fully formed. Thus, in three days, Luo Tian cultivated a lotus that would have taken seven to mature—his speed had more than doubled.

“Three days to cultivate a lotus!” Long Xiao’s eyes widened again, his astonishment mounting with each revelation.

Luo Tian’s face was pale; though the Ten Thousand Revitalization Scripture was transcendent, its consumption was immense. The rate of cultivation directly correlated with the toll it took. In three days, his Nine轮回 Immortal Bodies (Nine Reincarnations of the Immortals) had grown faint.

“Is time enough?” Luo Tian smiled, then sat cross-legged to recover.

A day passed in silence. Luo Tian rose slowly and initiated his second cultivation cycle. Again, three days later, the second seed formed successfully.

“Four… eight… nine…” A month passed swiftly, and Luo Tian finally completed the cultivation of the Xuanshuang Lotus.

Its leaves gleamed like a mirror, radiating coldness. The lotus roots bore nine seeds, resembling stars embedded within them. Under the sun’s gaze, they glowed radiantly. The marsh for ten miles around was entirely frozen.

“First one!” Luo Tian extended his hand, plucking the nine seeds and presenting them to Long Xiao’s spectral form. He spoke softly.

Then, Luo Tian vanished from the spot, continuing his search for a second sacred herb. Within a day, he found it. With the experience of the first Xuanshuang Lotus, his mastery of the Ten Thousand Revitalization Scripture had improved significantly. He cultivated it in twenty-six days, successfully producing a sacred herb.

The third herb took him a month to complete, which he then presented before Long Xiao’s spectral form.

“An endless treasure!” Long Xiao murmured, gazing at the three sacred herbs. His gaze shifted to Luo Tian with newfound respect. He even hoped Luo Tian would complete the third trial, securing his inheritance. Perhaps then, Luo Tian might one day achieve what he himself had failed to.

Luo Tian’s recent feats had deeply shaken Long Xiao, each accomplishment defying impossibility and reigniting his hope. He too had once sought to turn the impossible into reality, but in the end, he had perished.

“If I have enough sacred herb seeds, I can cultivate countless sacred herbs. With them, enhancing the strength of Tianyuan Continent would be effortless!” Luo Tian’s excitement surged as he envisioned the continent’s future.

“You’ve passed the second trial. Now comes the third—perhaps the most challenging! If you succeed, you’ll inherit all I accumulated,” Long Xiao smiled warmly, his gaze now kinder. He waved his hand again.

A resonant hum enveloped Luo Tian, and he vanished from the field, appearing in a small chamber.

“This third trial is about elixir formulas. To an alchemist, each formula is crucial. Thus, the third trial requires you to create one of at least nine-tiered potency using over a hundred herbs!” Long Xiao smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

“Creating an elixir formula!” Luo Tian’s lips twitched as he gazed at Long Xiao, inwardly wondering if the latter was again increasing the difficulty.

“Of course, don’t think of using a pre-existing formula to deceive me,” Long Xiao smiled.

Luo Tian rolled his eyes; given Long Xiao’s vast knowledge of herbs, he likely possessed many formulas. If they coincided, his prior efforts would be wasted. Thus, Luo Tian had no intention of using familiar formulas to deceive Long Xiao.

“If I must walk my own path, then let me begin with the elixir arts,” Luo Tian mused, his eyes resolute.

Chapter 1551: Creating an Elixir Formula

“Time is one year. If you fail to create one within that span, it’s a loss. As a reward for reaching this point, I’ll grant you one of my elixirs and a rare sacred herb,” Long Xiao addressed Luo Tian before vanishing into the chamber.

“One elixir, one rare sacred herb!” Luo Tian’s heart leaped with joy. While he wasn’t particularly eager for elixirs, Long Xiao had been a high-tier immortal-level alchemist. Though his elixir mastery might surpass Luo Tian’s, it was likely only a high-tier sacred elixir.

High-tier sacred elixirs were treasures others could only dream of, but for Luo Tian, with effort, he could achieve them. Yet what truly stirred him was the rare sacred herb Long Xiao had mentioned—the true purpose of his journey into this tomb.

“Master, can I choose the sacred herb myself?” Luo Tian called out to the void.

“Of course. I’ll reveal all the sacred herbs I possess; you may select one,” Long Xiao’s voice echoed in the chamber, prompting a smile on Luo Tian’s face.

“With no more worries, I’ll focus on research,” Luo Tian murmured. Since he could choose, he would request Long Wu Ice.

“Let’s try a mid-tier sacred elixir. A nine-tier formula isn’t too significant for me,” Luo Tian smiled, sitting cross-legged on the cushion.

Luo Tian didn’t rush to create an elixir formula but instead recalled all the formulas he knew.

Each formula passed through his mind, its unique purpose and effects. He dissected each herb’s role thoroughly, even the temperature of flames.

Time passed swiftly; a month had elapsed before Luo Tian opened his eyes, sighing in awe.

“Difficult… creating an elixir formula requires not only deep knowledge of herbs but also understanding if certain herbs’ essences clash. Additionally, flame temperatures greatly affect potency. Two or three herbs are manageable, but too many demand endless trials,” Luo Tian mused. He now understood how arduous it was to create an elixir formula.

“First, determine the purpose—wound healing, longevity, cultivation enhancement, or a last-ditch power-up?” Luo Tian pondered before deciding.

“Cultivation enhancement is unattainable in the short term. The Reincarnation Scripture’s subsequent techniques are incomplete. Wound healing I have the Immortal Herb for. Longevity is too distant now. Thus, let’s attempt a power-up elixir,” Luo Tian mused before extending his hand. A crimson elixir materialized in his palm—Xue Xie (Bloodlust Elixir), seized from Tu Feiyang.

“This elixir is no ordinary one!” Long Xiao’s face showed surprise; he recognized the elixir’s potency.

“This Bloodlust Elixir can unleash one’s potential, but its consequences are akin to using a forbidden technique. It’s quite a trade-off,” Luo Tian mused, his eyes gleaming as he scrutinized the elixir.

Though he knew its ingredients, he didn’t know how many were needed to craft it. Yet as the creator of an elixir formula, he could only refer to it for inspiration—after all, the Bloodlust Elixir was a bloodline secret and wouldn’t be easily replicated.

“Perhaps use fewer of these volatile herbs…” Luo Tian delved into research, entering a frenzy of calculations.

“One… ten…” Time passed swiftly as Luo Tian’s calculations expanded, his excitement growing with each new herb he could incorporate.

“Less than a month—has it already begun?” Long Xiao’s face showed confusion, watching Luo Tian’s relentless calculations.

Yet he didn’t interrupt; he knew that disturbing Luo Tian now could ruin his progress.

“Back then, when I first created a nine-tier elixir formula, I was in this state,” Long Xiao sighed softly, seeing himself reflected in Luo Tian.

“Reverse Blood Elixir!” Luo Tian smiled after a month of research, having constructed another formula. Though inspired by the Bloodlust Elixir, its effects and principles differed greatly.

He extended his hand, summoning a black cauldron with seven dragons encircling it.

“This cauldron!” Long Xiao’s face showed surprise; he hadn’t expected Luo Tian to possess such a treasure.

“This youth has been concealing his true strength; he must be an alchemist of high rank,” Long Xiao realized.

“Boom…” As Long Xiao pondered Luo Tian’s alchemical level, Luo Tian struck the cauldron’s lid. Seven-colored flames erupted from his palm, surging into the cauldron’s fire hole. The small chamber filled with searing heat.

“What is this!” Long Xiao’s face changed instantly.

“This is the seven-colored flames cultivated by my master!” Long Xiao, a disciple of Fire Lord Meng Yixian, recognized the flames.

“Master!” Long Xiao murmured softly, his eyes filled with reverence. As an alchemist and dragonkin, he was proud, but there was one figure he revered above all—his master, Meng Yixian.

Seeing the flames cultivated by his master now, how could he not be moved?

“Hum…” Flames surged within the cauldron. Luo Tian then struck his storage pouch, summoning herbs radiating immense vitality. His hands moved swiftly around him.

“This technique is surely the result of years of alchemical mastery. What level is this youth?” Long Xiao’s eyes filled with curiosity.

“Xuanyin Vine… Nixing Branch…” Herbs were added to the cauldron.

“100… 200… 300…” Over hundreds of herbs surpassed Long Xiao’s trial limit of a hundred.

“He isn’t aiming for a nine-tier elixir but a mid or high-tier one!” Long Xiao observed, his face turning shocked. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to choose the most difficult path.

“Young man, your ambition is high,” Long Xiao shook his head. He had once created an elixir formula, but even he took ten years for a mid-tier one and nearly a century for a high-tier.

Long Xiao doubted Luo Tian could create a high-tier elixir in one month, believing only Fire Lord Meng Yixian could.

As Long Xiao sighed inwardly, Luo Tian hurled over four hundred herbs into the cauldron. The process began.

Each herb quickly turned to liquid under the seven-colored flames, divided into four hundred portions by Luo Tian’s formidable spiritual awareness.

“Amazing! This youth’s spiritual awareness is truly extraordinary!” Long Xiao marveled, his expression one of disbelief for the hundredth time.

“Still, it won’t work,” Long Xiao smiled, knowing Luo Tian’s elixir would fail.

“Ten… a hundred…” Luo Tian carefully fused the liquid according to his formula.

But when he reached over a hundred liquids, a powerful surge erupted within his spiritual awareness.

“Boom…” The Seven-Storm Cauldron roared, shaking violently before Luo Tian.

“Damn it, it’s about to explode…” Luo Tian’s face darkened instantly. He withdrew his hand from the cauldron’s fire hole and dashed toward the chamber’s exit.

“Open!” Luo Tian shouted, pushing against the door. Yet as his hand touched it, his face turned pale.

A resonant hum echoed; red fire seals spread across the chamber’s walls, filling it with a powerful array.

“An array!” Luo Tian barely managed to utter before the cauldron’s lid burst open.

“Boom…” A blinding light erupted, unleashing a world-shattering force that consumed the small chamber—and Luo Tian.

Chapter 1552: Forging an Immortal Elixir

“Hmph, this youth’s body is truly remarkable!” Long Xiao’s spectral form smiled.

“Cough… cough…” The terrifying energy gradually subsided, and Luo Tian emerged from the chamber, coughing violently.

“What in the world…” Luo Tian cursed under his breath, never expecting this chamber to hold such a powerful array.

Though the explosion hadn’t harmed him, it had left his body emitting black smoke, coating his formidable physique in a layer of obsidian.

“Hum…” The red fire seals gradually receded into the walls, and the chamber calmed.

“Youth, this chamber’s array was gifted by my master when I left. Not even a near-Immortal could escape it!” Long Xiao’s voice carried amusement.

“Also, I advise you to create a nine-tier elixir formula instead. A mid-tier sacred elixir isn’t achievable in one year!” Long Xiao continued, his earlier dissatisfaction fading after witnessing Luo Tian’s seven-colored flames.

Luo Tian’s acquisition of Meng Yixian’s seven-colored flames proved his connection to the Fire Lord. Thus, Long Xiao had no more complaints.

“No need!” Luo Tian shook his head resolutely, his stubbornness reemerging. His eyes flashed with determination.

“It’s just an explosion; I can endure it. Without trying, how will you know it fails?” Luo Tian sat cross-legged again, his aura calming. He analyzed the cause of his failure and continued refining.

“Truly…” Long Xiao smiled, admiration in his gaze. He hadn’t realized how much he had grown fond of Luo Tian.

Time passed swiftly; another month elapsed before Luo Tian rose again, resuming his elixir forging.

“Boom…” Not long after, the Seven-Storm Cauldron roared again. Golden light surged skyward, filling the chamber and engulfing Luo Tian once more.

“Solved the previous issue!” The light faded, revealing Luo Tian with blood trickling from his lips but a grin on his face.

This time, he had fused nearly two hundred herbs before the explosion—though more violent than before, it had only shaken his qi.

“Youth, give up! If you continue like this, you’ll die. I was once like you and perished,” Long Xiao warned.

“Again!” Yet Luo Tian ignored him, sitting cross-legged and refining his calculations.

“Madman!” Long Xiao muttered, watching Luo Tian’s frenzied state. He didn’t stop him; he knew this phase was crucial, despite its danger. Just as he had once entered such a state and felt on the verge of forging an immortal elixir.

“Hope you succeed,” Long Xiao murmured, his spectral form vanishing into the chamber. He was but a ghost and couldn’t withstand such explosions; if caught, he would vanish entirely.

“Boom… boom… boom…” Over the following months, the chamber echoed with powerful detonations. Luo Tian grew increasingly wounded each time, and on one occasion, he had to recover for seven days. Yet instead of despair, his face showed excitement after each injury.

Time passed swiftly; four months later, the explosions grew more frequent. Luo Tian was knocked unconscious multiple times but awoke to refine again.

One day, he opened his eyes, revealing bone-white skin. He retrieved an elixir and swallowed it to recover. With only a month left until the year’s end, he prepared for his final push.

When Luo Tian opened his eyes again, golden light radiated from them. His injuries had healed, though his clothes were tattered, resembling a beggar.

“Truly determined youth!” Long Xiao had watched Luo Tian’s persistence and stubbornness, moved to the core. He saw himself in Luo Tian, who was even more relentless than his younger self.

Moreover, Long Xiao sensed that each refinement brought significant progress. The longer he fused the liquids, the closer he came to success.

“I’ll grant you another year,” Long Xiao said softly, his voice filled with admiration. “If you create a nine-tier elixir formula, I’ll bestow my inheritance upon you.”

“Thank you, master. No need,” Luo Tian smiled, approaching the Seven-Storm Cauldron. Seven-colored flames erupted from his palm again, and he hurled herbs into the cauldron.

“Hum…” He skillfully fused the liquid, a task he had performed countless times in the past year. The vast number of herbs consumed over time was staggering, but his storage pouch held infinite resources, allowing him to endure.

“Can it truly succeed?” Long Xiao’s face showed doubt as he watched Luo Tian, who now radiated confidence. Though he would have dismissed it before, Long Xiao was unsure now.

Half an hour passed; four hundred and seventy liquid portions were fused, each carefully blended.

“100… 200…” Luo Tian meticulously combined the liquids, though he had done this many times before.

“Four hundred and fifty-eight… four hundred and seventy… the final herb!” Luo Tian recited mentally, fusing the last liquid into the mixture.

“Hum…” A surge of energy echoed from the Seven-Storm Cauldron, and white smoke rose, carrying a fragrant elixir aroma and potent herbal energy.

“Success…” Long Xiao gasped, watching the rising smoke. He had no words to describe it.

“Elixir genius!” Long Xiao’s mind echoed with the four words.

“Back then, I was called an elixir genius by the Nine Realms. But compared to this youth, I’m nothing!” Long Xiao’s eyes held a bitter smile.

The elixir refinement process was familiar to Luo Tian, but he remained cautious, fearing any mishaps. His spiritual awareness compressed the liquid relentlessly.

“Boom…” A thunderous roar echoed in Luo Tian’s ears—this was the elixir trial.

“Finally succeeded!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, focusing on refining the elixir.

Under his careful refinement, the Seven-Storm Cauldron roared with a powerful sound, as if a fierce beast struggled to break free.

“Open!” Luo Tian struck the cauldron’s lid, and a violent gust of energy burst forth, blowing his tattered robes.

Golden light surged upward, like a blazing sun. A golden elixir emerged from the cauldron.

“Success!” Luo Tian exhaled softly. Now, it was beyond his control; no alchemist could shield an elixir from its trial.

“Boom…” Golden lightning descended, but the black ceiling seemed transparent, unable to block it. The lightning surged toward the golden elixir.

“Damn! This is an array, why can’t it block the elixir trial!” Luo Tian cursed. Though untested elixirs had lower potency, he still hoped this one would succeed.

As his words ended, the golden elixir glowed radiantly, hovering above his head. It was struck by golden lightning, as if bathed in it.

The lightning faded, and the elixir remained suspended above his head, appearing even more solid.

“Boom…” Yet another thunderous roar echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, a powerful pressure spreading through the chamber.

“What is this?” Luo Tian’s face tensed; this elixir trial was different from the previous one.
