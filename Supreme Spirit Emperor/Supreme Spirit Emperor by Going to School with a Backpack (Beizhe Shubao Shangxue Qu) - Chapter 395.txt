Chapter 1563: The Union of Divine and Demon ()

"Demons devour all life!" Facing the terrifying strike from Yaochen, Nan Gong Wu Bei also dared not be careless. Vast waves of demonic energy surged from his hands, forming a colossal figure that loomed over heaven and earth. A black demonic hand struck down with immense force, pressing against Yaochen's golden staff.

Yaochen's eyes flashed with golden light. At the moment the black hand descended, his staff shifted slightly.

"Boom...!" In an instant, the golden staff collided with the black hand. The demonic hand exploded in a burst of energy, shrouding the starry sky with vast waves of demonic aura.

"Buzz..." Yet within these waves, golden light pierced through the darkness, leaving trails of afterimages that swept toward Nan Gong Wu Bei.

"Even this cannot be withstood!" Standing behind the demonic figure, Nan Gong Wu Bei's face twisted in shock, his mind filled with terror.

"Ugh..." The staff sliced through the stars, instantly piercing through the black demonic figure and striking Nan Gong Wu Bei's body.

"Spit...!" Nan Gong Wu Bei coughed blood, his body flying backward with a thunderous sound. His flesh began to fracture in大片, his chest caved inward.

"Uncle Hou! You're amazing!" Yan Jun roared, watching Yaochen clad in golden armor, radiating overwhelming might. His eyes burned with intense admiration.

At this moment, Yaochen seemed like the sovereign of an era, his entire body radiating boundless battle spirit. His light even obscured Luotian, as if nothing in the world could withstand a single swing of his staff.

"Rubbish! You're no better!" Yaochen roared to the sky, his golden eyes locking onto Nan Gong Wu Bei flying backward. He swung his staff again, aiming to sweep away the wounded and exhausted Nan Gong Wu Bei.

"Ah...!" Nan Gong Wu Bei also roared to the sky. As a son of an era's sovereign, born in the same great age, he was utterly crushed by Yaochen. This fury made him completely mad.

"Ugh..." On the divine beast continent,澎湃 demonic energy rose again. A black demonic sword thundered forth, radiating wild power, appearing before Nan Gong Wu Bei. Black demonic energy surged from the blade into his body, instantly healing his wounds.

"Die!" Nan Gong Wu Bei grabbed the black demonic sword. Invisible waves of energy blew through his black hair as he stood under the stars, raising his hand to unleash a blade of demonic energy from the sword.

The black demon moon erupted, radiating immense power toward Yaochen. An attack from an era treasure was immeasurable; even if Yaochen was extraordinary, he would surely not withstand it.

But Yaochen had already rushed forward. There was no time to dodge; their speed was too fast, even a near-king level cultivator could not react.

"Monkey!" Luotian roared, throwing a punch that sent Sun Yuhuang coughing blood. His face showed madness but his eyes held despair, watching Yaochen swing his staff against the devastating blade.

"Uncle Monkey!" Yan Jun and others also roared, feeling a powerful life-threatening crisis under the attack of an era treasure. One strike would mean death, no chance for rebirth.

"Haha... you're dead!" Sun Yuhuang panted heavily, his body nearing destruction. Yet his eyes showed great joy. If Yaochen died, it would be a fatal blow to Luotian and the others.

At this moment, the Divine Sword and the Tremendous Wheel were locked in conflict. Their side had gained another era treasure from the demon clan, a single artifact that could change much.

"Boom..." Under everyone's eyes, Yaochen's golden staff collided with the black blade. A powerful explosion echoed through the starry sky, and Yaochen's figure was completely swallowed by the black mist.

"Monkey!" Luotian roared, watching Yaochen engulfed in dark demonic energy. His eyes showed madness; he no longer cared about Sun Yuhuang, rushing toward the surging demonic mist.

"Dead... it's dead..." Yan Jun and others felt a wave of sorrow, especially Yan Jun. Though he had often been bullied by Yaochen, they had known each other for a long time. Besides his love of battle, Yaochen was actually a good person.

"Haha... Luotian, now it's your turn! I wonder what you'll use to resist!" Nan Gong Wu Bei laughed wildly, holding the black demonic sword. He stood under the stars, his gaze fierce as he looked at Luotian.

"Damn it! If the Soul-Subduing Pagoda wasn't left in Fire Domain, what right do you have to be so arrogant!" Sun Mengru's face was cold as she wielded a golden sword, cutting another demon warrior into blood mist. She flew toward Nan Gong Wu Bei. If Yaochen truly died, then Nan Gong Wu Bei would have no opponent left. Among the remaining people, only she and Li Tianzhi could match a son of an era sovereign.

"Boom..." Luotian smashed through vast waves of demonic energy with a punch, waving his hand to disperse the dark mist. Yet he found no trace of Yaochen in the starry sky.

"Haha... his body and soul are destroyed! An all-out strike from an era treasure could never be withstood!" Sun Yuhuang's face showed confidence. Though their side suffered heavy losses, the tide had now turned in their favor.

"If you seek death, I'll grant it!" Nan Gong Wu Bei looked at Sun Mengru rushing toward him. His face remained cold, the black demonic sword raised again. After all, though he could activate an era treasure, he was not a sovereign of the era and couldn't sustain it endlessly.

"An all-out strike from an era treasure is truly powerful!" As Nan Gong Wu Bei slowly raised the sword again, a bold voice echoed through the starry sky. A golden staff fell from the void, striking Nan Gong Wu Bei's body.

"What's going on!" Everyone was stunned by the scene, forgetting to attack their enemies, eyes filled with intense disbelief.

"Spit...!" Nan Gong Wu Bei's eyes also showed strong shock, being struck again and sent flying. Even his demonic sword was thrown into the void.

"You're not worthy of taking my life!" Yaochen's body radiated golden light as he emerged from the void, his face showing a slight weakness.

"Didn't... didn't die..." Everyone's faces showed disbelief, looking at Yaochen standing there.

After an all-out strike from an era treasure, he had not died—no one in history could achieve this. Not even the young sovereign of an era had done so.

"It's impossible!" Nan Gong Wu Bei was stunned by Yaochen's strike, his body disintegrating into a mass of blood mist.

"Hmm?" At the same time, Luotian appeared in people's sight, holding a strand of golden hair. His face showed confusion.

"This technique is beyond limits!" Luotian looked at the golden strand in his hand, knowing it came from Yaochen. He must have used some method to evade that destructive strike. Luotian didn't believe anyone could withstand an all-out attack from an era treasure.

Yet he noticed the weakness in Yaochen's eyes, clearly showing that using this technique had cost him greatly.

"Buzz..." The black sword returned from the void, appearing above Nan Gong Wu Bei who was about to turn into blood mist. It touched Nan Gong Wu Bei's blood, emitting a brilliant black light that stabilized his disintegrating body.

"No matter what methods you have, you all must die! Surviving once was already a great fortune. I don't believe you can survive again!" Nan Gong Wu Bei stood with Sun Yuhuang, his eyes fierce as he looked at them.

"Buzz..." The black sword hovered above the two, emitting a humming sound as yin and yang energy swirled around them.

Both shouted simultaneously, the yin and yang energy forming two dragons that roared before briefly merging into one. The merged energy surged into the black sword, which exploded in size, emitting a thunderous sound and an overwhelming aura.

An immense phantom formed, gripping the black sword as it swung toward Luotian and others again.

"What should we do?" Yan Jun and others showed concern, facing an era sovereign's son wielding an era treasure. Even if they were prodigies, they could not withstand it!

"Master Yin Fish, I need your help again!" Luotian smiled bitterly, waving his hand as the black Yin Fish surged forth.

"Luotian, why can't you be nice to me! I just woke up, and now you're making me fight an era treasure!" The Yin Fish's spirit roared in Luotian's mind.

"I've had bad luck for eight lifetimes! Why did I choose you as my master? I'm so frustrated!" The Yin Fish's voice carried strong resentment, making Luotian's mouth twitch.

"I don't want to either!" Luotian smiled bitterly, feeling guilty. After all, it was always a coincidence.

"Remember how mighty the Divine and Demon Diagram was back then! Now it's been humiliated by these young upstarts!"

"I was iron back then!" The black Yin Fish kept jumping, surging forth to clash with the black sword.

"Ah! This is the Divine and Demon Sovereign's Divine and Demon Diagram!" Seeing the Yin Fish, Nan Gong Wu Bei and Sun Yuhuang's faces changed instantly, their eyes filled with excitement.

"This is our ancestor's treasure!" Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei shouted, essentially being descendants of the Divine and Demon Sovereign.

"Boom...!" The thunderous sound echoed as the massive Yin Fish collided with the black sword. A shocking scene followed.

The devastating sword seemed to have met its match, retreating slightly as it approached the Yin Fish.

Chapter 1564: Let Me Have a Favor ()

"Boom...!" The thunderous sound echoed. Though they collided, it was far less intense than the clash between the Tremendous Wheel and the Divine Sword.

"Damn it!" Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei's faces darkened, watching the sword retreat.

"Goodness, you have some filial piety!" The Yin Fish's spirit said proudly in the starry sky, its skeletal figure appearing.

"You are an elder; my master once said that when encountering the Divine and Demon Diagram, you should grant three chances!" A voice echoed from the black sword, its spirit awakening after the collision.

"Kill them!" Luotian and others showed great joy, rushing forward to attack Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei.

"Buzz..." But as they moved, the black sword emitted a thunderous sound again, enveloping Sun Yuhuang, Nan Gong Wu Bei, and the divine and demon clan's warriors.

"Combine forces to break through the barrier!" Yaochen sneered, swinging his golden staff toward the barrier covered in black runes.

A golden vortex rose above everyone's heads, forming a golden seal that flew from Luotian's hands toward the sword's barrier.

Yan Jun, Li Tianzhi, Sun Mengru and others also unleashed their martial arts, striking the sword's barrier.

"Boom...!" The thunderous sound echoed as terrifying storms struck the black barrier. Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei's faces turned pale, their blood swirling as they were震 by Luotian's group.

"Kill them!" Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei's faces darkened, their hands activating again. The black sword expanded in size, swinging toward Luotian's group.

"Yin Fish!" Luotian transmitted to the Yin Fish spirit, and the black Yin Fish collided with the sword again, still evenly matched.

"Kid, don't be so smug. Adding his three chances, I can only help you twice more!" The Yin Fish spirit hovered above Luotian's head, transmitting to him.

Light flared as a golden sword landed in Sun Yuhuang's hand, and the Tremendous Wheel returned to Li Tianzhi's front, rotating slowly.

Sun Yuhuang spat out a blood-red seal into the Divine Sword. Golden light surged, and golden figures reappeared as if the era sovereign had returned. An overwhelming aura surrounded the golden sword, which swung toward Luotian's group.

"He has awakened the sword spirit of the Divine Sword!" Luotian and others' faces darkened as they saw the Divine Sword's power rising again.

"Three chances!" The Divine Sword also echoed the same words, but both sword and blade swung toward Luotian's group.

One strike from each of the two era treasures, wielded by a son of an era sovereign, could annihilate near-king level cultivators.

"I'll rely on my old face to block this one time; the next will have to be your own!" The skeletal Yin Fish spirit trembled as it spoke, diving into the Yin Fish and rushing toward the two supreme era treasures.

As before, the two mighty swords' power diminished as they approached the Yin Fish.

"You all handle it!" The Yin Fish's voice echoed in Luotian's mind, returning to his head.

"Kill them!" Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei knew this outcome, activating their two era treasures again to strike toward Luotian's group. This time, the black sword radiated overwhelming power, as the sword spirit and Divine Sword spirit had said. After three chances, they no longer yielded.

"Let's fight!" Li Tianzhi also spat blood, landing on the Tremendous Wheel. Though not a son of an era sovereign, he could still unleash two all-out attacks.

"Boom...!" The Tremendous Wheel collided with the black sword, creating a thunderous sound that swept across the stars.

However, the Divine Sword transformed into golden light, striking toward Luotian's group, making Yan Jun and others' faces change.

"Boom...!" Luotian's hands continuously manipulated, a remote ancient palace bathed in infinite divine light, descending to crush the Divine Sword.

"What is this? Is it an era treasure? Why do I feel no substance!" Seeing the golden palace, Nan Gong Wu Bei and Sun Yuhuang's faces changed abruptly.

They had two era treasures, while Luotian's side had one—clearly their advantage. Though the Yin Fish spirit counted as half, it could not withstand several attacks from a complete era treasure.

Yet this sudden arrival of the ancient palace shattered their calculations. If another era treasure existed, their chances would vanish completely.

Not only them, but also Sun Mengru, Li Tianzhi, and Ren Hongzhe showed disbelief.

"Damn it, use the era treasure when you have to!" Yaochen sneered at Luotian, but then his eyes flashed with amazement.

"This is!" Yaochen couldn't help but exclaim, watching the thundering ancient palace.

"It's not a real ancient palace; it's an illusion created by the unparalleled technique!" Soon, everyone realized this golden ancient palace was not a real object.

"This is the 'Ancient Palace of the Divine and Demon' used by Gu Tianshu to counter countless near-king level warriors!" The demon masters immediately recognized how the ancient palace was formed.

"Truly amazing, Luotian has inherited Gu Tianshu's true teachings!" The demon master's face showed admiration, looking at Luotian. He felt Luotian was even more astonishing than Gu Tianshu, and if he entered the near-erat sovereign level, he might become even more invincible.

Under people's astonished gazes, the golden palace collided with the Divine Sword, and a thunderous sound echoed in their ears.

However, this was an era treasure created by Luotian, and it still had differences from a real one. If not for Luotian's 'Eight Directions of the Treasure' technique, which suppressed the Divine Sword at the moment of collision, it would have been impossible to withstand.

"Crash..." The golden sword flew backward, and the golden ancient palace instantly collapsed, sending waves of golden energy across the starry sky.

"Spit...!" Luotian spat blood, and his nine immortal reincarnations in the dantian vanished five of them. His ten thousand zhang body returned to its original size, clearly showing he had suffered heavy injuries from the clash.

"Surviving an attack from an era treasure, the cost is indeed great!" Luotian's face was pale as he muttered. Though he had survived, it cost him a great deal; era treasures were not easy to counter.

"Surviving once is already astonishing!"

"Although you're strong, it's not wise to come here without preparation!" Sun Yuhuang's face showed cruelty. He could feel Luotian had been injured, and he spoke with disdain.

Sun Yuhuang's face was pale, his vitality not much better than Luotian's. Yet his body still surged with era power into the Divine Sword.

The Divine Sword erupted with ten thousand feet of golden light, flying toward Luotian's group. Yan Jun and others felt a sinking heart.

Seeing the golden sword, Luotian's face also showed tension. At this moment, they seemed to have entered a desperate situation. But Luotian still had the Era Book, an unparalleled secret that could suppress era treasures. Though it was sometimes effective and sometimes not, Luotian still wanted to try.

"Finally arrived?" However, as Luotian just wanted to move the Era Book, his pale face showed a smile. He took a step forward, raising his hands to perform an incantation, and white era power surged into the still-unhealed starry sky.

Thunder roared again, and an immense pressure descended from the void. At the same time, the golden palace flew out of the void again, descending to crush the Divine Sword.

"Another trick! I want to see how many times you can withstand it!" Sun Yuhuang's face showed disdain, knowing Luotian must have paid a heavy price.

"Crack..." Under everyone's astonished gaze, the golden palace collided with the Divine Sword again.

The collision's residual power surged, sweeping toward everyone. Gray void turbulence blocked their vision, and the Divine Sword flew backward from the turbulence, returning to Sun Yuhuang's group's head. It sprinkled waves of divine light.

The Yin Fish also scattered black light, protecting Luotian's group as the collision's residual power struck the barrier.

Gray mist churned, gradually calming down. Sun Yuhuang's face showed cruelty: "This time, you're dead!"

Sun Yuhuang shouted loudly, but then golden light rose from the gray turbulence, silencing Sun Yuhuang's voice.

"What's going on!" Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei, along with the divine and demon clan's warriors, showed disbelief.

In the gray mist, the golden palace did not collapse as before but stood in the starry sky, emitting waves of misty vapor like a celestial palace.

"Something's wrong! Damn it, this is real!" Sun Yuhuang's face turned completely dark. He looked at the golden palace and finally recognized it as a real era treasure, not one created by Luotian's technique.

"Who is he?" Soon people saw a purple figure standing on the golden palace, his hands behind his back. He radiated a lonely aura, as if he were the ruler of all existence.

"Haha..." Seeing the ancient palace, Yan Jun and Li Tianzhi showed joy.

"This kid's ability to show off has improved again!" Li Tianzhi smiled, looking at the purple figure.

"Who is he? Why does he give me a feeling of invincibility!" Luotian and others knew Diao Dezhu was showing off, but Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei, who had never seen Diao Dezhu before, were stunned by his aura.

Chapter 1565: Give Me a Favor ()

"Sigh..." A long sigh echoed from the purple figure's mouth. Diao Dezhu stood on the ancient palace, his gaze locking onto Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei.

"You're seeking death yourself, daring to harm my friend!" Diao Dezhu's face was cold, his gaze locking onto Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei.

"Who are you!" Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei's minds trembled, their eyes cautious as they asked. They were immediately intimidated by Diao Dezhu's aura.

"Haha..." Seeing Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei intimidated, Yan Jun, Li Tianzhi, and others couldn't help but laugh. Even Luotian and Yaochen couldn't hold back their laughter.

Hearing their laughter, Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei felt even more uncertain, thinking that Luotian's backup had arrived.

"Are you Gu Tianshu?" Sun Yuhuang asked, but soon the elders of the divine and demon clans behind them spoke.

"He is Diao Dezhu, a prodigy from the Demon Region. However, he's still not as good as Luotian and Long Jie!" An old man's face turned red. He hadn't expected a son of an era sovereign to be intimidated by Diao Dezhu.

Other elders from the divine and demon clans also turned red, their eyes looking at Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei.

"Damn it!" Hearing the old man's words, Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei's faces turned red. Especially when they saw the mocking looks in Luotian's group's eyes, their expressions turned even darker.

Diao Dezhu they had heard of before, but only in passing. They had seen his portrait, but never imagined the powerful young man before them was that awkward Diao Dezhu.

"Boom..." As Diao Dezhu prepared to speak again, several figures rushed out from the ancient palace. Their auras were terrifying. One figure appeared behind Diao Dezhu, kicking his buttocks.

"Hey! Who kicked me!" Diao Dezhu's voice echoed in the starry sky. At the same time, he looked at people on the ancient palace.

"Bravado for three breaths!" Luotian's group smiled, watching Diao Dezhu standing there. Their hearts finally relaxed; now their side's strength was absolutely overwhelming the divine and demon clans.

"Step aside to show off!"

"What time is it, still showing off!" Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi's group showed disdain, looking at Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei and the warriors behind them.

"Damn it, you're really tired of living! The divine clan is again in need of punishment!" Xu Liyi cursed, walking to their side.

"Damn it, Zheng Xin you bastard! Daring to kick me!" Diao Dezhu's face showed anger, his eyes unkindly looking at Zheng Xin.

Long Jie's aura was terrifying; seeing Luotian's group in such a pitiful state, his face turned cold.

"Buzz..." The ultimate Dao's power descended, and the Demon Emperor Mirror buzzed, flying out from Long Jie's hands into the starry sky.

At the same time, Long Jie and others flew down from the ancient palace, landing before Luotian's group. Their eyes showed disdain as they looked at the warriors of the divine and demon clans.

"What should we do?" Now it was Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei's turn to despair. Three era treasures pressed heavily on them; if they truly fought, they would die several times over.

Moreover, Luotian's side was absolutely overwhelming. Luotian, Long Jie, Yaochen, and Li Tianzhi were all prodigies capable of clashing with a son of an era sovereign.

Even Diao Dezhu, Zheng Xin, and Xu Liyi were prodigies, stronger than them. It was an absolute overwhelming force.

"Hand over the battle spear!" Luotian spoke coldly, his gaze fierce as he looked at Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei. His eyes held killing intent.

"What! What about the battle spear!" Hearing Luotian's words, Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi's faces turned grim. They looked at Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei, their fierce killing intent spreading toward the warriors of the divine and demon clans.

"Haha... how do you think he's still alive? We can't kill him!" Sun Yuhuang's face showed cruelty, his gaze locking onto Luotian.

"Die!"

"Kill them, search their minds!" Xu Liyi roared, his eyes wild and bloodshot.

"Kill!" Long Jie waved his hands, emitting ultimate Dao beams from the Demon Emperor Mirror to sweep toward Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei.

"Boom...!" Luotian also activated the ancient palace, pressing toward the warriors of the divine and demon clans.

"Ugh..." The Tremendous Wheel, with its overwhelming aura, spun rapidly, stirring the stars and sweeping toward Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei.

"Yin-Yang Unification, Invincible!" The Yin Fish embedded in the Divine and Demon Diagram pressed with immense pressure, following closely.

Three era treasures, each emitting strong fluctuations, plus the Yin Fish embedded in the Divine and Demon Diagram, which was also comparable to an era treasure. This would make anyone despair unless the sovereign of the era personally intervened, making it a death trap with no solution.

"Damn it!" Seeing four mighty treasures, Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei's faces showed madness. Now they no longer thought about how to kill Luotian's group but focused on self-preservation.

"Buzz..." The Divine Sword and the Demon Sword, two era treasures, emitted fluctuations on their own, flying above everyone's heads. The two era treasures collided, and an invisible fluctuation descended from their collision, protecting Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." As this fluctuation descended, four powerful attacks struck down, colliding with the invisible barrier.

The devastating power formed in this collision spread outward, explosions echoing throughout the starry sky and extending into the nine domains.

"Another collision of era treasures, from where!" In the nine domains, both human and ancient tribes were shaken. They were stunned by these thunderous sounds.

"In the ancient tribes, near-king level masters emerged from their cultivation chambers, their faces showing a hint of joy."

"Is it the human tribe!" The ancient kings' clan said, their faces showing joy. "The human tribe started fighting among themselves? The fluctuation of the battle has reached here! This is definitely not a result of one era treasure colliding!" The near-king level masters' faces showed joy, looking at the void. A human tribe's internal conflict was a good news for them.

"It's the divine and demon region! What happened, who is attacking the divine and demon region? Why did it produce such fluctuations!" The various sanctuaries of the human tribe were also disturbed.

However, soon people received news and learned that it was Luotian's group attacking the divine clan.

"This divine clan is really despicable! When Luotian single-handedly entered the divine clan's land, it was destroyed completely. After years of recovery, it had just recovered when they offended Luotian again. How could anyone dare to provoke the four sacred star regions? They really have no memory!" People from several regions discussed.

"If Luotian truly flattens the divine clan, no one will be able to rival the four sacred star regions in the future!" People then sighed, as if they saw a new era arriving—a new era of the four sacred star regions, an era of Luotian.

The fierce storm gradually calmed down. The golden sword and the black demon sword's luster dimmed after this collision, and the divine clan's land also suffered, losing a sacred mountain. Blood mist floated in the starry sky.

Although people from the divine clan had fled to their sacred mountain during the fight, some were too slow and were caught in the collision's residual waves, dying completely.

Under the barrier formed by the Divine Sword and the Demon Sword, it was also heartbreaking—bloody mist coalesced into human forms, forming Sun Yuhuang, Nan Gong Wu Bei, and the warriors of the divine and demon clans.

Though protected by the Divine Sword and the Demon Sword, they could not withstand it completely, being turned into blood mist. If not for the protection of these two era treasures, they would have already been annihilated.

"I want to see how many more times you can withstand!" Luotian's face was cold as he spoke to Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei. This was the same line of words that Sun Yuhuang had said before, now returned to him by Luotian.

"Go..." Sun Yuhuang's face was grim, exchanging a glance with Nan Gong Wu Bei. They knew if they didn't leave now, there would be no chance left.

Thinking of this, Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei, their faces pale and cultivation level dropped to the late era stage, extended their hands. Two drops of blood flew from their hands into the Divine Sword and the Demon Sword.

The humming sound returned, an invisible fluctuation acting on Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei. At the same time, the two supreme era treasures collided again, creating a massive crack in Luotian's group's vision. They carried Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei into the void.

"Want to run? Let me suppress this starry sky!" Luotian didn't want to give them any chance. After all, if they lived and left, it would be a potential threat to the four sacred star regions. To eliminate the root of the problem, since they had already torn their relationship apart, Luotian would not allow anyone who could threaten the four sacred star regions and held hostile intentions to exist.

Luotian waved his hand, and the ancient palace and the Divine and Demon Diagram exploded with power. Long Jie and Li Tianzhi also activated the Demon Emperor Mirror and the Tremendous Wheel, pressing the four directions of the crack.

Four era treasures pressed on the starry sky, and the massive crack quickly healed, making Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei and the warriors of the divine and demon regions feel intense despair.

"Alas... Luotian, give me a favor. Let them go this time and settle my karma!" Just as the starry sky was about to heal, a low voice echoed through it.

Chapter 1566: Taking Over the Divine Clan ()

"Buzz..." The voice fell, and the Yin-Yang Fish image formed by the Divine and Demon Diagram separated from the starry sky, returning to Luotian and Sun Kemin's heads.

"Go..." With the Yin-Yang Fish's withdrawal, Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei showed great joy. They activated the Divine Sword and the Demon Sword, breaking free from their constraints and rushing into the void.

"Damn it!" Luotian's face darkened, activating the ancient palace to crash into the void toward Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei's direction.

The Demon Emperor Mirror and the Tremendous Wheel also unleashed powerful attacks, trying to keep them before they could escape.

"Boom...!" A powerful explosion echoed again. The entire void exploded under the attacks of three near-erat treasures, creating devastating waves that could move anyone.

"Eventually they escaped!" Luotian's face darkened, looking at the starry sky gradually healing. The void had a lot of blood, and three supreme era treasures hovered in the void before emerging, stained with lots of blood.

"Killed a few old men, but the biggest threat Sun Yuhuang and Nan Gong Wu Bei escaped!" Yaochen's eyes glowed, speaking to Luotian's group.

"It's the child of the previous master!" The Yin-Yang Fish transmitted to Luotian and Sun Kemin, explaining why it was not under their control.

"Xuanyuan Qiong!" Luotian's face darkened, shouting toward the distance. His eyes showed coldness. Without the Yin-Yang Eyes reminding him, he had already recognized this voice was from Xuanyuan Qiong.

"Luotian! Long time no see!" In the black starry sky, Xuanyuan Qiong stepped through the stars and appeared in Luotian's group's sight.

"Very powerful!" Yaochen's face was serious, but his nature of love for battle had no hesitation. He grabbed his staff and swung it fiercely toward Xuanyuan Qiong.

The golden staff instantly shattered the stars, appearing above Xuanyuan Qiong's head with terrifying power.

Xuanyuan Qiong's face showed a smile, his eyes reflecting the golden staff. He extended his hand to grab it.

"Arrogant!" Seeing Xuanyuan Qiong so careless, Yaochen's face showed anger. No one had ever dared to easily accept his attack before.

"Boom..." Under everyone's shock, Xuanyuan Qiong's hand grabbed the staff.

However, soon everyone gasped, looking at Xuanyuan Qiong's body slightly sinking.

Yin and yang energy burst from Xuanyuan Qiong's body, then rapidly rotated together to form a massive vortex behind him. The entire starry sky twisted for an instant, then returned to normal.

"Unsurpassed as a battle saint monkey!" Xuanyuan Qiong spoke, looking at Yaochen and retracting his hand. He slightly clenched his fist.

"Divine and Demon cultivation, truly astonishing! So fast, he has reached the near-erat sovereign level!" Luotian couldn't help but speak softly, his eyes filled with admiration.

Yet Luotian didn't know what he felt—partly happy, as the human tribe had produced another formidable near-erat sovereign. But he had let his life's enemy escape.
