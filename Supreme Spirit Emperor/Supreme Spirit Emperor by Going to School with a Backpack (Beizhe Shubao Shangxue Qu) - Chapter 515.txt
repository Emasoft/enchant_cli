If True Immortals were to oversee the array, it would be somewhat of a waste. Yet everyone had been waiting anxiously for Luo Tian, intending to pass the array onto each hall master.

On the second day of waiting, Luo Tian's figure appeared at the gates of the Rising Dragon Sect, his face carrying a faint smile.

Though he had spent only a short time in the Rising Dragon Sect, Luo Tian found a sense of belonging there, much like when he had first entered the Five Elements Sect.

"Luo Tian Senior Brother... Oh, no, Luo Hall Master!" As soon as Luo Tian arrived at the gates, he heard a chorus of exclamations.

"What's wrong?" Luo Tian's face showed confusion as he looked at the disciples of the Rising Dragon Sect, their eyes alight with surprise.

"Luo Hall Master, hurry up! The three Grand Elders have been searching for you almost madly. Why did you return so late?" The disciples, upon hearing Luo Tian's confusion, shouted loudly.

"Little brat, come over here!" Zang Yunfei and the other two Grand Elders, who had been waiting anxiously for Luo Tian's return, immediately spotted him upon his entry and barked at him.

Luo Tian shrank back slightly, a smile on his face, and hurriedly made his way toward the main hall. At the same time, the other hall masters and True Immortal-level attendants also converged toward the hall.

Not long after, Luo Tian arrived at the grand assembly hall where the elders convened. Upon entering, he saw familiar faces and a faint smile crossed his lips.

"Stupid kid, you're back?" Sima Xiu's brows furrowed slightly as he watched Luo Tian ascend to the peak of True Immortal, his eyes showing disapproval.

"A half-year, nearly a year—no progress at all. Do you have the face to return?" Peng Tiande barked loudly.

Upon hearing Peng Tiande's scolding, the others' mouths twitched involuntarily. The path of cultivation was one of gradual accumulation; Luo Tian had left as a True Immortal peak and returned the same. In their eyes, this was normal—after all, it took years to master a single level, and Luo Tian's path of ultimate extremes was far more arduous.

"Three Grand Elders, what business did you call me for?" Luo Tian ignored their discontent. Though they scolded him, as soon as he entered the hall, he sensed them exhale deeply, clearly worried about his safety.

Though Luo Tian had made no progress in cultivation, he was confident that even True Immortal initial-level opponents were unlikely to escape his grasp.

If before Luo Tian could flee from a True Immortal initial-level opponent, now he was confident he could annihilate them. Yes, annihilate—those three months with Lu Chong had given Luo Tian a qualitative leap in power.

As he thought of the Splitting Heaven Saber, the Shooting Sun Bow, and the Yin Fish, as well as Lu Chong's excitement when he handed over the three treasures, Luo Tian's lips curled into a smile.

"Stupid kid, what are you daydreaming about? I'll explain the current situation of our Rising Dragon Sect!" Zang Yunfei, seeing Luo Tian's lewd grin, barked.

"Grand Elder, please speak!" Luo Tian quickly snapped out of his thoughts, his expression slightly solemn as he looked at the three. Their urgency to recall him clearly indicated a major issue.

"This array, take it back yourselves. As for the allocation of disciples, you'll arrange it among your halls. Remember, this great array is crucial—only you can master its entirety; others should only be given partial knowledge," Sima Xiu said, waving his hand. Except for the five hall masters of the Attendant Hall, each received a jade slip.

"Great God Array?" Luo Tian grabbed the jade slip in his hand, his face slightly serious as a complex array structure appeared in his mind.

"Give yourselves one month to master this array and complete it entirely," Peng Tiande declared loudly, then fell silent.

"Yes!" Including Luo Tian and Zuo Qiu Ming, the six hall masters spoke in unison. Then, under the gaze of Zang Yunfei and the other True Immortals, they exited the hall.

"Luo Tian, in the Struggle for Heaven battle, try to preserve yourself!" As soon as they exited the hall, Xuan Dan transmitted a thought to Luo Tian, warming his heart.

"Senior Brother, rest assured!" Luo Tian replied, then greeted Zuo Qiu Ming and others before heading toward the Disciplinary Hall.

Not long after, Luo Tian arrived at the Disciplinary Hall, gazing at its orderly ranks. Each disciple's face bore respect; though he had been away for half a year, his authority remained the highest in the Disciplinary Hall.

"Respect your hall master!" Zhao Tiecheng and Zhao Tiancheng, their faces bearing a grim expression, were followed by Zhang Xiaoxing and Qian Luofeng, whose eyes also showed excitement as they bowed to Luo Tian.

"Everyone has worked hard. Let's go in and talk," Luo Tian smiled, stepping into the main hall of the Disciplinary Hall.

As they sat down, Luo Tian observed Zhao Tiecheng and Zhao Tiancheng, nodding in approval. The two had now reached the peak of True Immortal, while Zhang Xiaoxing and Qian Luofeng had also risen to the later stage of True Immortal.

Other familiar faces among them carried a stronger aura than when he had left.

"Relax, and tell me about the situation in the Disciplinary Hall," Luo Tian spoke softly. To set up an array, he first needed to understand the Disciplinary Hall's condition.

"Master, our Disciplinary Hall now has a total of 100,000 disciples. Two are at the peak of True Immortal, fifteen at the later stage, and the rest are at the middle stage," Zhao Tiecheng spoke loudly, his voice carrying pride.

"Hmm?" Luo Tian's eyes showed surprise. Nearly 100,000 at the middle stage of True Immortal—though their strength seemed unimpressive, 100,000 middle-stage True Immortals were a formidable force.

"It seems the three Grand Elders have favored the Disciplinary Hall, entrusting it with elite disciples," Luo Tian mused internally, feeling that Zang Yunfei and the others had treated him well.

"Good," Luo Tian nodded, looking at those in the hall before taking out a jade slip and dividing it into several parts, handing them to the attendees.

"This is a great array; you must cooperate. Since you know the current Disciplinary Hall best, entrust the rest to your brothers below," Luo Tian spoke softly, entrusting the core of the array to himself.

"Tiecheng and Tiancheng, you two control the head of the Great God Array."

"Xiaoxing, Luofeng, you fifteen at the later stage of True Immortal will control the limbs of the Great God Array."

"As for the remaining meridians, the 100,000 disciples—distribute them as you see fit," Luo Tian added, causing the others to stiffen.

"This array is our Rising Dragon Sect's key strategy; do not take it lightly," Luo Tian reiterated.

"Alright, go and distribute the array. As for allocating disciples, I'll discuss it with the other hall masters and the Sect Leader," Luo Tian said. Zhao Tiecheng and Zhao Tiancheng, among others, departed to begin arranging the array.

"Phew..." Luo Tian watched them leave, exhaling deeply before opening the jade slip to study it. After all, he was the array's eye, the core of the entire formation.

Though he had never eaten pork, Luo Tian had seen pigs running—Wan Lingkong was a master of arrays. Thus, though his array skills were not outstanding, he was at least half-competent, knowing more than others.

"Enormous power!" After deciphering the array at midnight, Luo Tian could not help but exclaim. This Great God Array fused everyone's strength into a single giant, connecting all together in endless transformations. Whether one was at the Heaven-Ordaining stage or True Immortal, the more people involved, the greater its power.

However, the more people there were, the harder it was to form the array—hence why Zang Yunfei and the others had divided it into five parts.

"Truly an excellent array; those three old men are lucky," Luo Tian smiled, waiting for dawn.

"Come and discuss the allocation of disciples," the next morning, as the sun rose, Li Changfeng's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

Chapter 1980: Crossing the Illusory Heaven Sea!

"Our Rising Dragon Sect has a total of 4.6 million disciples, excluding the 700,000 in each hall, leaving 3.9 million," Li Changfeng spoke softly, stating the total number of disciples in the Rising Dragon Sect.

"Among them, nearly 800,000 are at the middle stage of True Immortal, one million at the initial stage, and 2.1 million at the Heaven-Ordaining stage," Li Changfeng continued, his voice calm.

"Dragon Hall, Earth Dragon Hall, Medicine Sage Hall, and Seal Instrument Hall each have 150,000 middle-stage True Immortals and 400,000 Heaven-Ordaining disciples. The rest will be allocated to the Disciplinary Hall—do any of you have objections?" Li Changfeng spoke softly, leaving only the five halls besides the Attendant Hall to distribute disciples.

"I have more?" Luo Tian spoke softly, calculating based on Li Changfeng's numbers—this meant he would have nearly 50,000 more middle-stage True Immortals and 100,000 Heaven-Ordaining disciples than the other halls.

"It's not a big difference; everyone knows that besides the Attendant Hall, the Disciplinary Hall holds all elite disciples. Thus, this time we prioritize your Disciplinary Hall."

"Moreover, as the Sect Leader, if you shine in the Struggle for Heaven battle, it will also earn more trust from the sect disciples. Even other middle-three realms' sects observing will regard our Rising Dragon Sect differently," Li Changfeng said, his gaze on Luo Tian.

"Indeed, the Struggle for Heaven battle has no winners or losers—only life and death. The battlefield is vast, and we cannot protect your safety. If the Sect Leader were killed, it would be a significant blow to our morale," Zhao Tian Di of the Earth Dragon Hall spoke.

"Yes, Luo Senior Brother, don't refuse," a young man from the Medicine Sage Hall spoke, his face burning with fervor. This youth was Chen Qingshan, the newly appointed Medicine Sage Hall master assigned by Xuan Dan. As a True Immortal, and now at the middle stage of True Immortal, Xuan Dan would naturally join the True Immortal battlefield.

"Alright, I won't refuse. Our Disciplinary Hall will not disappoint you," Luo Tian laughed loudly, his eyes filled with confidence. All present were young generation members; the oldest was from Zuo Qiu Ming's era.

"Good, soon our Attendant Hall will personally transmit thoughts to each disciple, directing them to your mountain peaks. We'll open the Lost Battlefield for you to practice arrays," Li Changfeng's face showed satisfaction, his gaze on Luo Tian and others with vigor.

The Lost Battlefield was originally meant for the three sects to vie for Struggle for Heaven qualifications. Li Changfeng and others had not expected they would enter it peacefully.

After allocating disciples, Luo Tian and the others returned to their respective mountain peaks. At the same time, the entire Rising Dragon Sect was in motion—both outer and inner disciples received transmissions from attendants, rushing to their assigned mountain peaks.

It took nearly seven days for the sect's disciples to find their assigned mountain peaks.

"Lost Battlefield opened!" As soon as the disciples had settled, Zang Yunfei and the other two Grand Elders with the Attendant Hall opened the Lost Battlefield.

"Buzz..." A resounding fissure appeared in the sky above the Rising Dragon Sect.

"Disciplinary Hall, lead your disciples into the battlefield!" A solemn voice echoed, causing Luo Tian and Zhao Tiecheng to stiffen slightly.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian took flight, rushing toward the fissure first, while the Disciplinary Hall disciples and those assigned also rose, with True Immortal initial-stage disciples leading the Heaven-Ordaining disciples toward the massive fissure.

Dozens of thousands of figures instantly darkened the sky, like a vast black cloud, rushing into the fissure.

"Dragon Hall, lead your disciples into the battlefield... Earth Dragon Hall..." Disciples took flight one by one, rushing into the fissure.

Flying through the gray passage, Luo Tian and others landed on a desolate land filled with barren气息. There was no sun or moon, only an amber sky.

On the ground were fragments of dimly glowing bones, indicating that their former owners had been strong.

A powerful battle spirit permeated the entire realm, and through this battle spirit's influence, everyone's eyes were filled with battle fervor.

"This is the battlefield where the three sects once vied for Struggle for Heaven qualifications," Zhao Tiecheng spoke to Luo Tian.

"Start practicing! We only have a month!" Luo Tian addressed the group, then took flight into the sky. At the same time, 100,000 Disciplinary Hall disciples and numerous True Immortals gathered around Luo Tian.

"Boom..." Not long after, a ten-thousand-zhang giant appeared in the realm, surrounded by dense spiritual energy.

Dozens of thousands of people connected in a special way, their eyes filled with excitement.

"Go..." Luo Tian stood at the heart of the giant, shouting loudly. Before his voice finished, the giant moved.

"Boom..." However, the moment it moved, the giant was unstable and shattered with a thunderous crash. A wave of figures scattered outward, falling onto the ground—Luo Tian included.

"Again!" Luo Tian knew this Great God Array would not succeed in one attempt, so he shouted and took flight again.

Gather, shatter, gather, shatter—on the vast battlefield, five giants continuously fused and formed. From their initial inability to move, they gradually gained the ability to walk and punch at the heavens.

While the Rising Dragon Sect practiced the Great God Array, in the middle-three realms' Guiyuan Sect, there was chaos.

The disciples of Guiyu Sect were also extremely tense. If before the Guiyuan Sect had a tenfold chance of success, now it was less than three.

"Other sects won't help us?" In the Guiyuan Sect's council hall, high-ranking disciples sat with heavy faces.

"Of course not; they're afraid of offending the Immortal King. After all, it was the Immortal King himself who destroyed us!" An old man spoke, his voice laced with bitterness.

If it weren't for the Immortal King destroying their seven-tenths strength, with True Immortal peaks nearly wiped out and only one remaining, a small sect like the Rising Dragon would never have been looked down upon.

"What are you afraid of? Though our Grand Elders were killed, I've heard about the Rising Dragon Sect. It only has three True Immortal middle-stage disciples. Our three of us are strong enough to counter them. Plus, our sect's high-ranking disciples must be stronger than theirs. With our arrangements, I think those fools from the Rising Dragon will fall into our trap!" A senior spoke.

"Right, a garbage sect from the lower-three realms dares to destroy us? That's absurd!" Other Guiyuan Sect elders also spoke.

"Have the Tianlang Sect and Ziyang Sect found out who killed their geniuses yet?" The senior leader spoke again, his eyes gleaming.

"No, unfortunately, the elder who was sent to kill that kid has died—mysteriously!" Upon hearing this, a middle-aged man's face turned angry.

A True Immortal middle-stage disciple was extremely precious for the Guiyuan Sect now; currently, they only had one True Immortal peak and two middle-stage disciples.

"We must not let the information we've gathered from the entire sect go to waste! Contact those old men and tell them to exchange for that person's name and portrait. Ask them to intervene at critical moments!" The True Immortal peak elder spoke, his voice cold.

"Good!" A middle-stage True Immortal nodded and left the hall.

"Alright, go comfort the disciples. I want to see what ability a small lower-three realms sect has!" The True Immortal peak elder coldly spoke.

Time passed slowly, and a month slipped by unnoticed.

"Boom..." Thunderous sounds echoed to the heavens as a ten-thousand-zhang giant stood in the amber realm, its body glowing with radiant energy. Dozens of figures were embedded within it, forming the heart, meridians, and flesh of the giant.

"Boom..." A cold voice echoed through the realm before the giant extended its fist, striking the ground.

"Crack..." The earth trembled violently; one punch would shatter this battlefield, leaving a deep ravine at the giant's feet.

"Disperse..." Luo Tian stood within the giant's body, his eyes filled with admiration. This Great God Array was truly extraordinary; once formed, it could rival a True Immortal peak, even a semi-Immortal King!

"Rustle..." As Luo Tian's words finished, the giant shattered into a wave of figures scattering in all directions.

"Haha..." Dozens of thousands of disciples all took deep breaths, their faces showing exhaustion but they laughed heartily. Within the array, they also felt its power; through it, they could feel safer.

War was a meat grinder—these Heaven-Ordaining and True Immortal disciples would be cannon fodder in other battlefields. But this Great God Array gave them a bit of security.

"Buzz..." The amber sky stirred with waves, and fissures reappeared.

"All disciples, exit the Lost Battlefield. Our Rising Dragon Sect will depart today to cross the Illusory Heaven Sea and participate in the Struggle for Heaven!"

"The Struggle for Heaven must be won. Because none of us have a way out—only by winning can we enter the middle-three realms, only by winning can we survive. Only by winning can we see a more splendid world!" A solemn voice echoed across the vast battlefield.

"Kill... kill... kill..." Luo Tian's side was filled with roaring voices, the immense battle spirit rising from everyone.

On another front, other battlefields also echoed with cries of war; five powerful battle spirits soared into the sky and converged.

"Go!"

"We don't have time to rest; on the Illusory Heaven Sea, there's enough for us to rest. I want you all to be in your best condition for the Struggle for Heaven! Let's showcase the Disciplinary Hall's style and elevate the Rising Dragon Sect's prestige!" Luo Tian shouted loudly, then took flight with the Disciplinary Hall disciples toward the fissure.

Chapter 1981: The Struggle for Heaven Begins!

Above the Rising Dragon Sect, figures appeared in the sky, instantly filling it and overshadowing heaven and earth. Everyone's bodies radiated powerful battle spirit, their eyes filled with excitement.

"Buzz..." Zang Yunfei, Peng Tiande, and Sima Xiu led the way, with the entire Rising Dragon Sect's True Immortals standing behind them. They looked at their disciples, who were exhausted but filled with battle spirit, and nodded in satisfaction before waving their hands.

"Roar..." Roars echoed in people's ears as waves of energy shot from their hands, followed by thunderous sounds. Vast warships appeared in the disciples' sight.

"Disciples, today our Rising Dragon Sect crosses the Illusory Heaven Sea and marches toward the middle-three realms!" Zang Yunfei shouted loudly, his voice shaking the heavens. The overwhelming power radiated from the three of them.

"Kill!" Millions of Rising Dragon disciples shouted, some with nervousness, others with excitement.

The roar and sea of voices swept across the lower-three realms, making all the sects' masters look with excitement.

"Go, to send off the Rising Dragon Sect!" The heads of various lower-three realms sects stood up, their eyes filled with respect. Whether the Rising Dragon succeeded or failed, this moment made them worthy of admiration.

"Centuries have passed without anyone succeeding in the Struggle for Heaven. This time, will the Rising Dragon succeed?" All sects' masters and elders were filled with anticipation.

The Rising Dragon Sect's strongest Struggle for Heaven in centuries, fused with three sects' strength—its power was terrifying. If they failed again, they would have no hope left.

Disciples orderly boarded the vast warships, with a hundred ships hovering above their heads.

"Beast! Go!" Zang Yunfei and the others spoke again, their hands moving. The massive barrier on Mount Rising Dragon shattered, releasing a wave of enormous beasts with fierce eyes and roaring as they flew toward the warships.

"Last Stand! If we don't succeed, the Rising Dragon Sect will be destroyed! If we do succeed, with the rich spiritual energy of the middle-three realms, our Rising Dragon Sect will surely have a place!" Zang Yunfei and the others took flight.

"Boom..." Thunderous sounds echoed, the sky trembled, and the massive warships carried all the Rising Dragon Sect disciples and beasts toward the direction of Illusory Heaven Island.

Ten warships, filled with immense battle spirit, pierced through the sky, and wherever they went, people of the lower-three realms looked up with reverence, shouting.

"Good luck to the Rising Dragon Sect in their Struggle for Heaven!" The cries of low voices kept rising, as people from the lower-three realms gazed at the ten warships that covered the sky.

The entire lower-three realms were in a frenzy, with many people spontaneously flying toward Illusory Heaven Island to send off the Rising Dragon Sect.

Ten days passed in a blink, and the ten warships arrived at Illusory Heaven Island's outskirts. The island was filled with people, their eyes brimming with anticipation as they gazed at the massive warships in the sky.

"Zhangshan Sect sends off the Rising Dragon Sect's Struggle for Heaven... Zhenzhi Palace sends off the Rising Dragon Sect's Struggle for Heaven..." A solemn voice echoed.

"Thank you, fellow disciples of the lower-three realms, for your send-off. Today, our Rising Dragon Sect participates in the Struggle for Heaven. We fulfill our promise with two Heaven-Ordaining Seals!" Zang Yunfei and Sima Xiu waved their hands, sending two streams of light from their palms toward the distance.

"This Struggle for Heaven Seal—I, Ziyu Sect, claim it!" As the Struggle for Heaven Seals flew out, a streak of purple light shot forth and headed toward one seal.

"What is Ziyu Sect?" But before the voice finished, streaks of light rose and rushed toward the two Struggle for Heaven Seals.

"Xuan Tian Island Master, please open the barrier and allow our Rising Dragon Sect to participate in the Struggle for Heaven!" Peng Tiande waved his hand, and another Struggle for Heaven Seal appeared.

"Good!" Jiang Huantian stood in the sky above Illusory Heaven Island, nodded, and waved his hand. The barrier that had blocked them disappeared into the sky.

"Thank you!" Zang Yunfei and the others bowed, then returned to their warships. The warships thundered as they disappeared into the vast Illusory Heaven Sea.

Almost immediately after the barrier opened, the Guiyuan Sect sensed it. The True Immortal peak Grand Elder took flight, his eyes filled with authority.

"The Struggle for Heaven has begun!"

"Disciples of the Guiyuan Sect, this is our sect's trial. But a small lower-three realms sect dares to target us? That's absurd! Come, follow me to see what the Rising Dragon Sect is capable of!" The elder spoke with authority, looking down on the Rising Dragon Sect.

"Kill..." The Guiyuan Sect disciples also shouted, their eyes filled with coldness and contempt.

"Buzz..." The hum of energy echoed as disciples and elders took flight toward the direction of Illusory Heaven Sea.

"Has the lower-three realms opened the Struggle for Heaven again? I heard this time the lower-three realms have gone all out, merging three sects into the Rising Dragon Sect. I suppose this time it will be interesting!" Not only did two sects tremble, but the masters of other middle-three realms sects also stood up and flew toward Illusory Heaven Sea.

If Guiyuan Sect failed, the Rising Dragon Sect would become a new middle-three realms sect. They wanted to know the Rising Dragon Sect's strength and whether it was worth bringing into their fold!

"Ha la la..." Waves of chaos surged, and the massive warships drifted on the endless coastline. Though the ships were vast, they still appeared small in the Illusory Heaven Sea.

"Roar..." Beasts from the sea emerged around the warships, but they were intimidated by the ships' power and dared not attack.

Zang Yunfei held the Struggle for Heaven Seal, its surface radiating divine laws that enveloped the ten warships. The sea beasts took flight and left.

"Without the Struggle for Heaven Seal, crossing the Illusory Heaven Sea would be like a dream!" Zang Yunfei and the others spoke softly, then closed their eyes to rest.

Luo Tian was surrounded on a warship, his face filled with awe as he gazed at the endless Illusory Heaven Sea. He then sat cross-legged to adjust his state, and others did the same—after all, they had exhausted themselves training the Great God Array in the Lost Battlefield.

Time passed slowly; Luo Tian and others spent a month on the ship. Though their states had recovered, being in the Illusory Heaven Sea for so long made the Rising Dragon Sect disciples uncomfortable, especially the Heaven-Ordaining disciples. Though the ships were stable, many still felt dizzy.

"Everyone, hold on a little longer—three days until we reach the middle-three realms!" Zang Yunfei and the others comforted them, looking at the Struggle for Heaven Seal hovering above the ship, constantly guiding them toward the middle-three realms.

There was no way around it; this was a weakening measure for sects participating in the Struggle for Heaven. Any sect entering the Struggle for Heaven must endure this trial.

Three days passed in a blink, and the ten warships finally reached the edge of Illusory Heaven Sea. Zang Yunfei and the others took flight, their eyes looking at the people of Guiyuan Sect standing on Illusory Heaven Coast, facing them across the sky.

"Many people—looks decent!" The masters of the middle-three realms looked at the ten massive warships, their faces showing amusement.

"I hope this Struggle for Heaven has some excitement!" Many masters stood together, whispering among themselves.

Behind the masters were their young disciples; the Struggle for Heaven was a once-in-a-century event, allowing these prodigies to experience war's brutality early—beneficial for their cultivation.

"Senior Brother should be among them!" Ye Wudao stood beside some young men, and Ye Xingchen spoke softly.

"If he were still in the Rising Dragon Sect, it would be better!" Cen Weihong's face showed a touch of sorrow. He was now a disciple of Star River Prefecture and couldn't act without orders.

"Lingkong, if there's a critical moment, we'll intervene!" Nan Gong Yuqing's face showed coldness as he signaled to Wan Lingkong and others. If Luo Tian were in danger, they wouldn't care about Star River Prefecture.

"Rest assured; I believe no one will die, but if Luo Tian has an accident, I won't believe it. We've faced bigger wars than this!" Ren Hongzhe shook his head lightly.

As they whispered, they also looked around, hoping to spot familiar faces—after all, with so many prodigies here, it was likely that two or three from the Nine Realms would appear.

"Rising Dragon Sect disciples, follow me! Charge into the middle-three realms!" Zang Yunfei and the others roared, their light piercing the sky. They led the charge first, shouting loudly as they transformed into streaks of light and attacked the Guiyuan Sect's people.

"Little Rising Dragon Sect, what are you? You don't even have a True Immortal peak. How dare you destroy us?" The Guiyuan Sect's people saw the Rising Dragon Sect's disciples approaching and showed contempt, their eyes filled with disdain.

"Kill..." The leading True Immortal peak elder also suddenly attacked, leading his True Immortal disciples forward.

"Comrades, follow me! Kill!" Luo Tian shouted and took flight, then landed at the back of the warship. With his arms, he pushed the massive ship forward toward the Guiyuan Sect's people.

The ten warships were not just for carrying but also a powerful means—entirely pushed by the Rising Dragon Sect disciples, they collided with the Guiyuan Sect's people.

"Rustle..." Waves of chaos surged across the sky, with immense impact crushing forward.

"Block it!" The Guiyuan Sect's side also responded, a series of voices rising. Next moment, streaks of light shot into the sky, thundering and gathering to form massive hammers controlled by the Guiyuan Sect's disciples.

"Great God Array opens!" Luo Tian's eyes flickered, and he suddenly took flight. At the same time, the Disciplinary Hall disciples also flew up, with dozens of thousands gathering toward Luo Tian.

"Great God Array opens!" At the same time, other hall masters also spoke, and in an instant, five massive giants stood on Illusory Heaven Sea.

Luo Tian stood at the heart of the giant, a towering aura rising in his chest, as if he were the giant itself, overpowering heaven and earth with True Immortal peak strength.

"Kill!" Luo Tian spoke softly, and the giant roared loudly, as if it could devour heaven and earth.

Chapter 1982: Guiyuan Sect's Disciple

Golden hammers, roaring with thunderous sounds, smashed toward the five giants. Meanwhile, the Rising Dragon Sect's giants pushed their massive warships forward toward the Guiyuan Sect's people.

"Buzz..." The warships' speed increased, five ships cutting through Illusory Heaven Sea, becoming streaks of light that instantly reached the Guiyuan Sect's people.

"Smash..." The Guiyuan Sect's people shouted, ten hammers suddenly turning and smashing toward the five warships.

"Crack..." Like a thunderclap in clear skies, this sound displayed the complete outbreak of the battle between the two sects.

"Boom..." Thunderous sounds echoed, hammers colliding with warships, the invisible waves spreading outward and instantly engulfing the five giants and many Guiyuan Sect disciples.

On another front, the True Immortal battlefield also began to fight—tens of thousands of zhangs above the sky, both sides found their opponents and explosions echoed constantly. The heavens instantly changed color, cracks forming everywhere.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." Waves of energy surged; within an instant, the Guiyuan Sect's disciples lost nearly 100,000 people, their blood instantly dyeing the Illusory Heaven Sea.

"This is only just beginning—how fierce!" The masters of other sects whispered, looking at the five giants retreating into the water.

The young prodigies of various sects also turned pale, looking at the crimson sea. This was their first time witnessing such a war; in an instant, tens of thousands vanished.

Within the array, many Heaven-Ordaining disciples also turned pale, but since the Great God Array was a shared fate, this powerful shock had no effect on them.

"With such a Great God Array, even if we face them, we are no match!" The masters of various sects showed admiration, never expecting the lower-three realms to have such an array.

"Kill..." Without hesitation, five giants took another step forward. This time, they did not push the remaining five warships but directly marched toward the Guiyuan Sect's people.

"Do you think this array is strong?" The Guiyuan Sect's people laughed, watching the giants approaching.

"You think this array is a secret weapon? It's worthless to us, because we intentionally let you know it!"

"You think this opportunity is a trap set by the Guiyuan Sect for you. You fools, country bumpkins have not disappointed us!" A True Immortal peak disciple directly faced Zang Yunfei and Sima Xiu but still suppressed them.

"What?" Upon hearing the True Immortal peak elder's words, Zang Yunfei and Sima Xiu's faces changed drastically.

Not only them, but other Rising Dragon Sect attendants also showed facial changes—unexpectedly, the Guiyuan Sect knew their Great God Array.

The Great God Array was specifically prepared by the Rising Dragon Sect for the Struggle for Heaven, its power immense. They intended to annihilate the Guiyuan Sect's disciples and then help eliminate True Immortal masters, ensuring their victory.

"Softly defeating the hard," a cold voice echoed from the Guiyuan Sect's side. The moment it spoke, the Guiyuan Sect disciples moved, waves of energy surging.

Next moment, five long snakes surged forward—each scale was a Guiyuan Sect disciple. The middle of the snake's head stood a True Immortal peak youth, his face cold as he directed the golden snakes to evade the five giants' attacks.

"Rustle..." In an instant, five flexible snakes rose and climbed up the giants' legs, wrapping them tightly.

"Pu..." A powerful pressure instantly enveloped Luo Tian's group; in an instant, countless disciples turned into mist.

"Damn!" Luo Tian's face changed violently; he knew they had been deceived. This Great God Array was intentionally given to the Rising Dragon Sect by the Guiyuan Sect, and they must have had a way to counter it.

"What kind of move is this?" The masters of other sects showed surprise, not expecting the situation to turn so abruptly.

"With this, the Rising Dragon Sect's numerical advantage is gone. Originally, the Rising Dragon Sect had hundreds of thousands more than the Guiyuan Sect, but now their advantage is gone. If numbers are equal, the Guiyuan Sect might completely massacre the Rising Dragon Sect!" Some masters discussed, their eyes on the five snakes wrapped around the giants.

"Disperse..." Luo Tian shouted; this array could not be maintained any longer. If they continued, they would all be crushed to death, including himself.

"Rustle..." The towering figures disintegrated; the Rising Dragon Sect disciples overflowed with blood, their eyes red. In just an instant, the Rising Dragon Sect suffered heavy losses.

They had no way to respond, only watching their companions die beside them, blood dyeing their bodies.

"Swallow them!" Before anyone could react, the golden snakes surged again, rushing toward the Rising Dragon Sect disciples. With a thunderous sound, the snake opened its mouth and instantly devoured a large number of Rising Dragon Sect disciples.
