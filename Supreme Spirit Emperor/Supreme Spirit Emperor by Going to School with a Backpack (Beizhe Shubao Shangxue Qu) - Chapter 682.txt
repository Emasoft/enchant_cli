“Cold!” Luo Tian’s lips curled. To feel cold was proof that the temperature here would freeze even an immortal to death.

His gaze swept across the horizon, where towering black mountains stood amidst swirling dark mist, as if time itself had frozen.

Upon closer inspection, the black mountains were actually solid ice formations, causing Luo Tian’s eyes to widen in surprise.

“It's so cold!” Luo Tian landed on the ground, his body surrounded by multicolored flames to stave off the chill. Prolonged exposure would be detrimental, even for him.

“What did they do?” Luo Tian walked along the icy path, scanning his surroundings with caution. He had learned the dangers of this ghostly marsh before—nearly trapped once, he would not let it happen again.

His face bore awe as he stood amidst the ice mountains, his body wrapped in flames.

After an hour of walking, Luo Tian halted, gazing at the ground littered with shattered ice.

“This was dug open!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, sensing faint fluctuations within the broken fragments.

“Was it Mo Tian?” Luo Tian mused, puzzled by why they would excavate the ice.

“They could have moved on, so there’s likely no danger!” Luo Tian muttered, continuing forward. If these ice mountains held treasures, they would not have left empty-handed.

Suddenly, Luo Tian halted before a towering black ice mountain. His eyes flashed golden as he sensed a figure frozen within.

An elder, clutching a long sword that radiated golden light—evidently mid-battle. His eyes held terror, frozen in an instant with no chance to react.

“Semi-Immortal King!” Luo Tian’s mind reeled, sensing the elder’s life had faded but his cultivation still remained.

“What technique is this?” Luo Tian marveled, eyes gleaming as he surveyed the surrounding ice mountains. Each contained a frozen figure or object—some with multiple captives.

“They must have excavated the mountains with treasures, taking what they wanted!” Luo Tian smiled, weaving through the ice formations.

“Friend… help…” A faint voice echoed amidst the wind, chilling Luo Tian to his core.

“Someone’s here!” Luo Tian instantly drew his blood knife, scanning the area. Only the wind and frozen figures remained.

“I’m not mistaken!” Luo Tian was certain of his ears.

“Friend… save me…” The voice echoed again, making Luo Tian frown.

“Who are you? Where are you?” Luo Tian shouted, his voice echoing through the void.

“The highest peak… I am here…” The weak reply came, then silence.

“The highest peak?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, gazing toward a thousand-zhang black mountain radiating cold.

Luo Tian’s body flashed forward, reaching the ice mountain in seconds. His eyes widened at the sight of countless frozen figures within, some even extending limbs from the ice—making his skin crawl.

“Many strong ones!” Luo Tian’s lips twitched, spotting Immortal Kings and even two late-stage Immortal Kings.

Especially the elder seated cross-legged atop the peak, his aura exuding immense pressure despite being frozen.

“Late-stage Immortal King!” Luo Tian felt the elder’s cultivation, matching that of the Black and White Reapers.

“Who could freeze a late-stage Immortal King?” Luo Tian trembled, staring at the elder.

“Not dead!” His shock deepened as he noticed a faint life sign, though weak, still present. Through his Thunder Yang Eye, he detected a faint fluctuation in the elder’s dantian—this was what preserved his life.

“Friend… save me…” The voice echoed again in Luo Tian’s mind.

“Who are you? Why were you frozen here?” Luo Tian asked cautiously, eyes on the elder.

“I am Qin Guanyu, Grand Master of the Dark Demon Sect. I do not know why, but nine-yellow abyssal ice fell from heaven and froze my entire sect!”

“Friend, please save me. I will grant you all the sect’s secret techniques!” The elder urgently transmitted his thoughts, desperate after eons of entrapment.

“How long have you been frozen? And how can I save you?” Luo Tian inquired, wary of the ghostly marsh’s ancient power.

“Long enough… millions of years!”

“Friend, I cannot endure much longer! Beneath this mountain lies a Nine-Yellow Jade Ice Stone. If you retrieve it or move its position, you can free me!” The elder’s tone shifted from desperation to hope.

“Nine-Yellow Jade Ice Stone?” Luo Tian frowned, unfamiliar with the term.

“This stone is precious! The sudden heavenly ice originally would have trapped me for a century, but over time it formed this Nine-Yellow Jade Ice Stone, intensifying the cold!”

“Even more, divine laws descended from heaven, fully entombing us. Time passed, and my sect perished—only I remain, clinging to life…” The elder’s words shook Luo Tian.

“I am also nearing my limit! I wish to pass on my sect’s legacy. Since you’ve come here, there is a connection. First free me, then I will teach you the sect’s secrets. Though frozen, our treasure vault still exists—everything is yours!” The elder urged again, his offer enticing.

“Master, how do I find the Nine-Yellow Jade Ice Stone?” Luo Tian asked, eyes on the mountain.

“You must dig beneath this mountain. One hundred zhang below the ice surface lies the Nine-Yellow Jade Ice Stone!” The elder replied.

“Dig it up?” Luo Tian’s lips twitched. This ice was no easy task, and he remained wary—what if the elder lied? If freed, would he be sacrificed?

“The treasure vault holds a supreme divine weapon. Retrieve it and pierce the ice!” The elder added.

“The treasure vault?” Luo Tian’s eyes brightened. A late-stage Immortal King’s vault would be invaluable.

“Something is off!” Yet Luo Tian felt unease.

“Mo Tian and the others must have entered this icy realm before. The elder surely noticed them, and would have asked for their help to free him. Why didn’t they?”

“Also, if the vault is real, Mo Tian’s nature would have already excavated it. This elder is subtly guiding me to the vault, not the ice stone! His true aim is to lure me there!” Luo Tian’s mind raced, suspecting the elder’s intent.

“No need, Master. I have a blade here that can cut through this Nine-Yellow Jade Ice!” Luo Tian revealed his blood knife, gripping it tightly as he slashed at the ice.

Crack…

Black ice shards flew, a crack forming in Luo Tian’s view. A smile tugged at his lips.

“Master, wait a moment. I should find the Nine-Yellow Jade Ice Stone shortly!” Luo Tian called to the elder, continuing to hack at the ice.

Time passed slowly as Luo Tian dug for two hours, finally reaching a hundred zhang depth.

The ice grew harder with each layer, even his blood knife struggled. Yet he glimpsed a faint black light through the ice, accompanied by an overwhelming chill.

This cold nearly froze his cultivation, making him hesitate to move closer.

“Powerful!” Luo Tian marveled at the Nine-Yellow Jade Ice Stone’s strength. Even an Immortal King would be frozen upon contact, and it could be a weapon in battle.

Crack…

The multicolored flames around Luo Tian slowed, their edges tinged with cold—fire itself struggling against the chill.

Luo Tian trembled, this cold his first encounter. Yet he remained tense.

“Master, how do I move the Nine-Yellow Jade Ice Stone?” Luo Tian called out through the ice hole.

Chapter 2550: The Corpse Sea Ice Plains

“Go to the treasure vault and retrieve that supreme divine weapon. Shatter its outer ice sheath, and it will be done!” The elder replied, still urging him to the vault.

“Hmph.” Luo Tian nodded but decided against it. These elders were no pushovers; even刑天’s head had caused chaos.

Luo Tian formed hand seals, his forehead’s flame mark glowing. The frozen flames around him surged violently.

Multicolored flames ignited the black ice, their crackling sounds echoing.

Six Paths Reincarnation Fist activated, Luo Tian’s fists slammed into the ice.

Boom…

The entire ice plain trembled, surrounding mountains groaning.

One punch wasn’t enough—two, and he’d prove this ice couldn’t hold him.

Determination burned in Luo Tian’s eyes as he continued striking, each punch capable of harming a mid-stage Immortal King.

Crack…

After 150 punches, the black ice cracked, dark mist seeping out. The cold intensified, freezing Luo Tian’s flames again.

Crack…

A bone-chilling chill coursed through his body, freezing him in place. His limbs sprouted ice shards, turning into a statue.

“Alas… you refused my advice. Why provoke this?” An ancient voice echoed, invisible force descending from the peak, enveloping Luo Tian.

“Life is fading!” Though frozen, Luo Tian sensed the force draining his vitality.

“You tricked me, and now you’ll pay!” The elder’s voice sneered. “The treasure vault is real, but it’s empty—those bastards already dug it out!”

“You sought this ice stone, so blame yourself. I’ll absorb your vitality to prolong my life!” The elder’s voice echoed, making Luo Tian realize his mistake.

“Tricked!” Luo Tian cursed internally. He’d miscalculated, the elder’s performance too convincing.

“I must escape or be drained!” Luo Tian decided, activating his Hell-Enduring Body, blood surging.

“Break…!” Luo Tian roared, his cultivation pushing against the ice.

Crack… Cracks formed, and Luo Tian’s icy shell shattered.

He panted heavily, his aura surging as he stared at the ice crystal, striking again.

Boom… Boom…

The thunderous sound returned as Luo Tian attacked the ice, cracks widening. Black mist spewed out, attacking him relentlessly.

“You won’t freeze me twice!” Luo Tian roared, his vitality fierce. Multicolored flames danced within him.

He kept punching, knowing only relentless attacks could speed his blood and cultivation flow to withstand the cold.

It was a battle between Luo Tian and the Nine-Yellow Jade Ice Stone—each trying to freeze him, each striving to retrieve the stone.

Time passed slowly. After an hour, Luo Tian’s fists turned bloodied.

Boom…

Finally, he broke through, surpassing some limit. Eight fists, each radiating divine power, struck the ice.

The Wind-Blade Storm Breakthrough had surpassed its limit, eightfold strength. The ice shattered instantly.

Ice shards flew as Luo Tian extended his snow-white hand, grabbing the floating black stone.

A cold sensation touched his palm, but the stone felt oddly comfortable, even easing his injuries from punching.

“Master, I’ve obtained the Nine-Yellow Jade Ice Stone. Please free yourself!” Luo Tian collected it, leaping to the ground, addressing the elder still seated atop the peak.

“You…” The elder had no words, only anger. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to truly obtain the stone.

“The damned flames and this kid’s body are too strong!” The elder cursed internally, but could only watch as he remained frozen.

“Master, I’ve done my part. I’ll be leaving now!” Luo Tian smiled, walking away. This stone was definitely a treasure; he felt it was worth the effort.

“Kid, come back! I still have treasures and techniques to give you!” The elder panicked as Luo Tian left.

“No need. I’ve learned too much; my knowledge is scattered!” Luo Tian scoffed, refusing to return. Treasures were risky—releasing the elder might bring trouble.

“Daring to trick me, to drain my vitality—dream on!” Luo Tian smirked internally, moving through the ice plain.

“You’re cunning, but you’ll fail. This Nine-Yellow Jade Ice Stone is also a formation core. I’ll stay here, waiting for the seal to weaken!”

“Once free, I’ll kill you, kid. And those bastards too!” The elder cursed, thinking of the others.

“Only fate will decide—whether I weaken this seal first or it kills me!” The elder sighed, watching Luo Tian leave.

Luo Tian saw many ice mountains dug open, cursing the group’s ruthless nature. He’d walked long without finding anything.

Time passed. As Luo Tian wandered the ice plain for a day, the cold gradually faded.

The ground changed—black soil appeared, earning Luo Tian’s smile.

“Who was that old man? He’s been frozen for years yet still alive!” Luo Tian mused, suspecting the elder lied.

He stopped thinking, focusing on the environment now devoid of coldness but filled with eerie vibes.

Black trees stood in a vast forest, making Luo Tian uneasy.

“They must have dug here for long before entering this strange forest!” Luo Tian muttered, debating whether to enter. The forest’s danger was palpable.

“They could go in, so I can too!” After a moment, Luo Tian stepped into the forest.

The forest was eerily silent, flat ground giving him some relief.

After an hour, the view opened up—but Luo Tian was stunned.

A sea of ancient coffins stretched before him, endless in number. Carved with various patterns, their lids were open, revealing glimmers of power.

“Treasures!” Luo Tian approached the nearest coffin, finding items untouched like in the ruined city.

He grabbed a sword—a lower-grade divine weapon—alongside some vials.

“Riches! Wealth!”

“Where are the corpses? The burial items remain!” Luo Tian mused, greedily collecting.

He took everything without checking, the coffins emptied swiftly.

Boom… Boom…

As Luo Tian reveled in his loot, a dull sound echoed from where he stood. His brow furrowed.

“Someone’s here!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed gold, scanning the path he came from. He nearly fell out of his coffin.

Figures approached from afar, emitting decayed aura, dressed in ancient rags, their bodies rigid yet sending shivers. Some had auras matching Immortal Kings.

“My god, so many zombies…” Luo Tian recognized them, sweat forming on his brow.

“I’m no match!” Luo Tian thought, eyeing a massive coffin at the distance.

It was larger than others, surrounded by coffins—evidently a zombie king’s lair. Luo Tian leaped onto it, realizing escape was impossible as zombies surrounded the area.

Chapter 2551: Zombie King

Luo Tian landed on the coffin, feeling a cold aura.

A sword—ancient, its blade swirling with divine laws, glowing golden. The hilt was rusted, the tip obscured by a green liquid.

“What is this sword?” Luo Tian wondered, gazing at it.

Then, cold air enveloped him.

Luo Tian jumped into the coffin without hesitation, standing mid-air as escape was too late.

Zombies surrounded the coffin sea, a nine-foot-tall figure leading them. Covered in green fur, with sharp teeth and immense pressure. Its chest bore a broken sword without hilt or blade.

“Roar…” Zombies roared, their eyes fixed on the towering figure—evidently the zombie king.

The king’s green eyes scanned, noticing the empty coffins.

“Roar…” The zombie king roared, its power overwhelming even Luo Tian hiding inside.

“This zombie king is at least late-stage Immortal King!” Luo Tian calculated, palms sweating.

“What to do?”

“Other zombies also have Immortal King auras. If I go out, they’ll kill me. Where did these zombies come from?” Luo Tian trembled, watching outside while eyeing the sword.

“What is this sword?” He hesitated to grab it, as zombies roared endlessly.

After a long time, the zombies calmed. The zombie king approached Luo Tian’s coffin.

Others searched coffins, some lying on the ground.

“Done for!” Luo Tian felt the king nearing, anxiety rising.

Crack… Crack…

Coffin lids closed silently, leaving only the zombie king before Luo Tian.

“I have a chance!” Luo Tian thought, his mind wild. He cloaked himself with divine senses to hide.

“No matter what, this sword is valuable. I must take it!” Luo Tian resolved, but feared he couldn’t control it.

“No choice—this is my only chance!” Luo Tian saw a large foot step into the coffin, splashing green liquid. A stench filled his nose, making him dizzy.

“This liquid is toxic…” Luo Tian thought, as another foot entered. He had to act.

In a flash, he grabbed the sword’s hilt and slashed at the zombie king.

But as he swung, he regretted it—this was a broken sword, unable to harm the king.

His move exposed him, startling the zombie king. It lunged without hesitation.

Boom…

Luo Tian felt as if hit by a mountain, flying back and colliding with the coffin wall. Blood spurted from his mouth. He activated Yellow River Steps, fleeing outward.

“Roar…” The zombie king roared, its green eyes surprised. It grabbed Luo Tian’s direction with a hand.

The hand shattered the illusion, and Luo Tian felt the king’s icy nails brushing his feet.

In an instant, he escaped the coffin, heart pounding. He flew upward to flee this coffin forest—this was no place for a early-stage Immortal King.

As for Fu Xingxuan, he planned to find her elsewhere.

Boom… Boom…

As Luo Tian exited the coffin, they slammed open, zombies flying out to fill miles. Cold glares met him.

“Roar…” Zombies roared, sensing this kid had stolen their treasures.

Boom… A zombie rushed forward, fists pounding Luo Tian.

Luo Tian roared, countering with a punch that sent the zombie flying.

“Strong body!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered, amazed at his punch’s power—yet it couldn’t break the zombie.

But as he felled one, dozens attacked him. Blood trickled from his lips. He wielded the broken sword, slashing wildly.

Buzz…

The blade cut through several zombies, their bodies splitting. A stench filled the air.

“This sword…”

“Powerful!” Luo Tian gasped, stunned by the broken blade’s strength. It sliced through zombies like tofu.

“If this broken one is so strong, what about the complete?” Luo Tian was thrilled but knew now wasn’t the time. The zombie king had risen, charging toward him.

Luo Tian didn’t linger, slashing another wave of zombies to escape the horde.

“Human! You’ve gone too far!” The zombie king roared, green eyes on Luo Tian. It charged after him.

“Damn!” Luo Tian cursed internally. The king’s speed was like lightning, closing in fast. Black claws aimed for him.

Luo Tian turned, taking the punch on his back. He swung the broken sword at the king’s claws.

Crack…

Sparks flew as the rusted blade met the king’s nails, screeching. The king remained unharmed, crushing the sword.

“Master, I didn’t mean to offend. I’ll return your things—let me go!” Luo Tian pleaded, surprised by the king’s intelligence.

“You’ve been too much lately. Those few who came here tricked me, taking two of my subordinates. I haven’t punished them yet. Now you steal my treasures!”

“Leave? Dream on! Stay with me and I’ll make you the strongest zombie. Only this path grants immortality!” The king roared, voice cold.

“See? This sword once killed me. Now I live, while the one who killed me is dead—killed by me!” The king’s voice held pride.

As he spoke, the king grabbed the broken sword with one hand and punched Luo Tian with the other. The air trembled, punches thundering.

“Six Paths Reincarnation!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, punching the king.

Thunder clashed, Luo Tian’s face paled as blood trickled from his mouth. His arm felt numb.

“Pure strength—my Six Paths Reincarnation was blocked!” Luo Tian marveled, the king’s power变态. Even he couldn’t withstand it.

Using the king’s punch force, Luo Tian released the sword and flew back.

“Why are there so many freaks here?” Luo Tian cursed, no wonder Black and White Reapers feared this ghostly marsh. This was just the outer edge—already this intense.

Luo Tian flashed through the forest, spitting blood as he fled toward the ice plain.

“Don’t think you can escape!” The king roared, gripping the broken sword, matching Luo Tian’s speed.

“Roar…” Zombies howled, their cold aura spreading as they followed the king.

“You’re too fast!” Luo Tian felt the king’s speed, slightly faster than his own but not enough to catch him.

“Once I reach late-stage Immortal King, I’ll kill you!” Luo Tian cursed, his Yellow River Steps blazing.

“Now I’ll kill you and make you my subordinate!” The king sneered, speed increasing. He wielded the broken sword, sending golden blades toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 2552: Fleeing to the Ice Plain

Luo Tian flashed like lightning through black mountains, zombies chasing him. The nine-zhang-tall zombie king wielded the broken sword, closing in fast.

“What else do you want?” Luo Tian roared, willing to fight if he had a 40% chance.

“Buzz…” A golden blade answered, Luo Tian parried with his blood knife, shaking his mind.

Using the collision force, he distanced himself from the king. His shoulder bore a wound, blood flowing.

Luo Tian fled desperately, this forest offering no hiding spots. He ran toward the ice plain.

“Don’t push me! No one will survive!” Luo Tian roared, slicing two zombies. It was too frustrating.

“You can’t escape. Be my subordinate and I’ll teach you immortality! It’s better than this!” The king roared, his attacks ruthless.

Cold air hit Luo Tian as he retreated to the ice plain. The zombies struggled with the cold, only five Immortal Kings and the king pursuing.

Even so, Luo Tian was in agony—just one king had him on edge. His thick skin was his only hope.

After three days of pursuit, Luo Tian was exhausted, covered in wounds—two infected from a mid-stage Immortal King zombie’s claws.

“Master, save me!” Luo Tian roared, sprinting toward the highest ice mountain. That old man was his only hope.

“Nine-Yellow Ice?” The king’s green eyes narrowed, recognizing the old man’s presence.

Though frozen on the peak, the king feared him, keeping their truce.

Luo Tian reached the old man’s ice mountain, surrounded by two Immortal King zombies.

“Kid, you brought these disgusting ones here! Ha! I won’t help!” The old man, like a statue, sat on the peak, radiating cold.

“Master, you can’t refuse! I freed you!” Luo Tian leaped to the peak, landing before the old man.

“Nine-Yellow Ice? What’s your connection?” The king stood below the peak, not rushing up.

“Don’t know. Kill him quickly and take his vitality—consider it a favor!” The old man, called Nine-Yellow Ice, replied.

“Cold!” Luo Tian shivered beside the old man, multicolored flames surrounding him.

“Master, you can’t do this! You said to lure him here and kill him, taking his sword!” Luo Tian shouted after hearing their conversation.
