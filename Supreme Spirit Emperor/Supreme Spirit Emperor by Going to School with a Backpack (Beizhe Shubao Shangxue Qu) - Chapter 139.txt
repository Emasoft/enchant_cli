"Rest assured, there must be a way!" Luo Tian directed his gaze toward Jiang Nanxuan, his eyes filled with hope.

"Don't look at me. I have no solution either. Unless there's a special teleportation array and a realm master, who could tear through the void and walk within it for long periods," Jiang Nanxuan shook his head, indicating he had no answer.

"Thud... thud..." As Jiang Nanxuan's words faded, a thunderous rumbling echoed from the sky above, drawing everyone's attention back to the group seated on the ground.

"Someone is about to undergo a heavenly trial!" Xu Liyi whispered, reactivating the recently closed array.

A slender figure appeared in the sky, her long robes fluttering dramatically. Her beauty was unparalleled—there could be no doubt it was Gu Qianxue.

As Gu Qianxue took flight, several more figures burst forth into the void. Among them were Gutai, Lei Yong, Ji Chen, and Wang Yulan—approximately forty to fifty people in total.

"Begin!" Lei Yong's voice rang out, laced with defiance. His gaze turned skyward.

Instantly, a sea of golden lightning enveloped the group, prompting Luo Tian and others to murmur in awe.

Time passed slowly. Lei Yong and Ji Chen were the first to break through into the Soul Consolidation Realm, while Gu Qianxue and others followed slightly behind but still reached the same realm.

Luo Tian's face lit up with joy. With these dozen people, the group now contained dozens of Soul Consolidation masters—such a terrifying power was beyond his imagination.

Moreover, the heavenly trials continued. More individuals broke through to the Soul Retrieval and Soul Consolidation realms.

The lightning storm lasted nearly seven days before finally dissipating. The four thousand or so people had fully ascended in power, with no one remaining at the Spirit Soul realm. The weakest was at the early stage of Soul Retrieval.

Such a terrifying force would be overwhelming even within the ancient relics of Xian Gu.

Thousands stood motionless in the void, their gazes filled with reverence toward Luo Tian. Without his aid, they would have taken much longer to break through.

"Everyone, I've helped you for a reason. I'm sure all of you understand—my only request is that when we leave, you won't hold back against the Tian Shi Sect. Don't be swayed by their tricks; unite when necessary," Luo Tian spoke aloud, his voice carrying a subtle smile that reached everyone's ears.

"Rest assured, Elder Luo. The Tian Shi Sect has been so brazen; we'll give it our all!"

"Yes! These bastards shouldn't exist at all. If we escape, let's just destroy them!" The crowd erupted in support of Luo Tian.

"Enough, everyone. Our only concern now is how to return," Luo Tian said with a bitter smile, addressing the group.

"Uh..." Luo Tian's words quickly plunged everyone into contemplation.

"What we need to do next is find a way back. The Xian Gu continent is vast. We'll have to scatter to search for an exit or something resembling a teleportation array—even if it's incomplete. After all, we have a ninth-rank array master; repairing it should be no problem," Luo Tian didn't wait for their reaction before continuing.

"Good!" The group didn't hesitate, all nodding in agreement before flying off in different directions.

But just as they had flown a short distance, a streak of light pierced the void above Luo Tian's group, causing their hearts to jump.

Seeing the radiant streak, Luo Tian's group narrowed their eyes in alarm. Those about to fly off regrouped before Luo Tian.

"Who is this?" Luo Tian felt a slight confusion. Among the group, his spiritual awareness was the strongest, yet he could only see an old man.

"An elder who has grasped a fragment of chaos power," Tian Luo's brow furrowed, his gaze deepening.

"The Xian Gu continent was supposed to have been destroyed. How can there be such a powerful figure? I don't recall meeting him," Jiang Nanxuan murmured, his expression darkening.

"Never mind. Since this old man seems harmless, let's follow him and see," Luo Tian decided with resolve, his footstep wind rising as he vanished from the spot, chasing after the old man.

The others followed suit, flying toward where the old man had disappeared.

Luo Tian's heart quickened as he pursued. He had activated his Seven-Step Sealing Steps, but still only caught a glimpse of the old man's back. Every time he tried to accelerate, the old man's speed increased further.

Chapter 681: Kneel Down

Chapter 681: Kneel Down

Within the ancient relics of Xian Gu, thousands of radiant streaks flew unevenly through the sky, chasing after an old man ahead.

Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan among twelve others flew at the front, their hearts filled with awe as the old man's speed was astonishing.

Mountains and rivers passed beneath them, but Luo Tian had no idea how long he'd been flying or how far he'd traveled.

The old man seemed unaware of their presence, leaving only a weathered back for Luo Tian's group to follow.

"One day... two days..." After seven days of flight, the old man finally slowed down and stood on a mountain peak.

As Luo Tian's group landed, they were surprised. The old man still faced away from them, and what caught their attention was the environment.

Due to the Tian Shi Sect's actions in the past, the entire Xian Gu relics had been ruined. Yet this mountain peak showed no signs of destruction—its body covered in dense forests, its vitality invigorating everyone's hearts.

"Respected elder!" Luo Tian dared not be impolite, bowing respectfully as he spoke.

Though they had some strength, Luo Tian's group was fragile against the might of a Soul Consolidation peak elder who had grasped a fragment of chaos power. Normally, they would never dare follow such a powerful figure.

"You've followed me all the way. What do you need?" The old man's voice rang out, laced with boundless arrogance, causing Luo Tian's group to tremble and instinctively retreat a few steps.

"I have no ill intent. I just have one question to ask the elder," Luo Tian's brow furrowed.

The old man's aura felt unlike that of Xian Gu continent cultivators, more like those from the Tianyuan continent. Yet there was a rule within Xian Gu relics: elders over a hundred years old could not enter. Luo Tian was puzzled how the old man had entered.

"What is it?" The old man still faced them, his voice carrying a hint of fatigue as it echoed in Luo Tian's ears.

"How do we exit this Xian Gu relic and return to the Tianyuan continent?" Luo Tian, sensing the old man's impatience, spoke quickly.

"The Tianyuan continent? Ha! You're from the Tianyuan continent to train, aren't you? In a thousand years ago, when the time came, I would have sent you out. But now... someone told me not to send you out. So, the Xian Gu relic is now impossible to leave!" The old man answered Luo Tian's question.

"Ugh... Luo Tian, how is it?" Zheng Xin panted as she stood before Luo Tian, asking.

As Zheng Xin landed, others gradually flew over from the distance and gathered behind Luo Tian. Their gazes were tense toward the old man.

"Is your name Luo Tian?" Before they could react, the old man's body trembled violently. His voice carried excitement. In an instant, he teleported Luo Tian before him and turned around, his eyes like lightning, staring intently at Luo Tian.

"Huh?" Luo Tian was teleported and startled. He then looked at the old man.

The old man wore a green robe, his head white-haired—nothing different from an ordinary elder. The only difference was the boundless arrogance in his eyes, which made people fear him.

"Strangely familiar... I think I've seen him before!" Luo Tian felt a sense of familiarity upon seeing the old man's appearance.

"Are you from the Southern Region's Bingji Island Luo family?" Before Luo Tian could think further, the old man's voice carried authority and echoed into everyone's ears.

"Yes, I am indeed Luo Tian of the Bingji Island Luo family," Luo Tian answered respectfully.

"Who is your father?" The old man continued questioning, his voice trembling slightly.

"Luo Nantian!" Luo Tian's eyes softened as he thought of his parents.

"Luo Nantian!" The old man tightly gripped Luo Tian's shoulders, pulling him up and grabbing his robe.

"Rip..." The old man tore open Luo Tian's robe, revealing his white buttocks.

Seeing the old man's actions, Leng Qiuchan and other women quickly turned away, their faces red.

"Damn!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly, pulling his robe back and showing anger on his face.

"The old man must be into that kind of thing!" Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi whispered, pitying Luo Tian who was held by the old man.

"Smack..." But as they just whispered, both felt a burning sensation on their faces and were sent flying backward.

"Haha..." The old man laughed heartily, tears of muddiness flowing from his eyes. His gaze shifted from the old man's buttocks' birthmark to Luo Tian, changing from authority to tenderness.

"Correct! No mistake..." The old man laughed loudly, shouting repeatedly. His voice shook the ears of Zheng Xin and others.

Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi stood up, seeing the old man laughing. Their gazes became more peculiar as they thought of someone with special preferences, but they dared not speak out. The slap still made them feel a burning sensation on their faces.

Luo Tian, hearing this laughter, felt even more confused. This laugh was oddly familiar, as if he had heard it before.

"Boy, kneel down!" The old man gently wiped his tears, gazing at Luo Tian with tenderness and spoke softly.

"Huh?" Luo Tian's brow furrowed upon hearing the old man's words. Though the old man felt familiar and kind, asking him to kneel was excessive.

"Why?" Luo Tian adjusted his robe, showing coldness and a resolute gaze toward the old man.

"I am Luo Tian. Though I'm not much, you and I are strangers. Asking me to kneel for you is excessive. A man of valor would rather die than be disgraced!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice filled with unyielding defiance.

"Good boy! You truly are my grandson. Good, good!" The old man's face showed satisfaction as he gazed at Luo Tian, his voice like thunder.

Luo Tian's face instantly changed. He looked at the old man, recalling the elder who had left Bingji Island alone for him.

"Is this old man crazy? How could he randomly claim a grandson? I never heard of Luo Tian having an grandfather?" Xu Liyi and Zheng Xin could no longer hold back, whispering lowly.

"Grandfather!" But as their words finished, Luo Tian's face showed excitement. His knees fell to the ground, and he spoke softly.

Chapter 682: The Conditions for Departure

Chapter 682: The Conditions for Departure

Luo Tian's heart was filled with excitement. Though his memories were hazy, he still remembered Luo Xiong's appearance. Although the hair in his memory was gray and white, it had now turned completely white. But after the old man's words, Luo Tian knew where this sense of familiarity came from—blood ties. This person was his grandfather, Luo Xiong.

Seeing Luo Tian's actions, Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi were stunned. Then they thought of their own impure thoughts earlier, their faces turning red.

Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan were awkwardly standing there, their hearts filled with tension. They didn't know whether to kneel with Luo Tian or stay put.

After Leng Qiuchan had sacrificed herself to save Luo Tian, Gu Qianxue had fully accepted her, no longer having any barriers. Their relationship seemed to have grown closer.

Others also looked at the grandfather and grandson with disbelief, marveling at the miracle of this meeting between a grandparent and grandchild.

"Get up," Luo Xiong spoke, his face filled with admiration as he gently helped Luo Tian up. His old face was indescribably excited.

"I never thought I'd grow so big. It seems my years here in the Xian Gu relics weren't wasted!" Luo Xiong's face showed admiration, his gaze filled with tenderness toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian hadn't expected to meet Luo Xiong under these circumstances. He was momentarily speechless.

But soon, he regained his composure, excitement in his eyes: "Grandfather, how did you end up here? Why haven't you returned to the Tianyuan continent or Bingji Island these years?"

"Alas..." Luo Xiong sighed, his voice laced with bitterness. He recounted the story of these years to Luo Tian.

It turned out that after Luo Xiong had left Bingji Island in search of a cure for Luo Tian, he met Yin Tianxiong shortly after. Yin Tianxiong had agreed to cure Luo Tian, but like Luo Nantian and his wife, he had a condition: Luo Xiong would be sent to the Xian Gu relics. When Luo Xiong reached the Soul Consolidation peak and grasped a fragment of chaos power, he would be responsible for sending back the Tianyuan continent's geniuses who came to the Xian Gu relics.

To save Luo Tian, Luo Xiong naturally agreed. Afterward, he settled in the Xian Gu continent, enduring endless loneliness—only he was a cultivator there.

Luo Tian's eyes were filled with tears as he listened to Luo Xiong's story. He looked at the aged Luo Xiong and knelt again: "These years, I've worried you!"

Others hearing Luo Xiong's story also showed admiration on their faces. They admired this old man who had spent years guarding the Xian Gu relics for his descendants.

"Good, you're alive. Even if I spend my whole life here, it's worth it!" Luo Xiong gently helped Luo Tian up. The more he looked at him, the more satisfied he was—more than when he had seen his son Luo Nantian. Indeed, the affection between generations was no joke.

"Grandfather, now that we're here, why don't you come back with us? The Tianyuan continent is currently in crisis. We..." Luo Tian spoke to Luo Xiong.

"Don't say more. I won't let you go back. The Xian Gu relics may be a bit desolate, but it's relatively safe. If you return, half a year later, the Tian Shi Sect will erupt into war. Also, Yin Tianxiong told me a few days ago not to send you back to the Tianyuan continent!" Luo Xiong interrupted Luo Tian before he could finish.

"Uh..." Luo Tian was stunned. He had thought that this was his grandfather, and returning to the Tianyuan continent would be a certainty. But Luo Xiong had decisively refused.

Others also showed disappointment, looking at Luo Tian and Luo Xiong. People thought the same as Luo Tian but hadn't expected that with this relationship, they still couldn't return. And seeing Luo Xiong's demeanor, he seemed to know more.

"Grandfather, can't you be lenient? Don't you want to see my father and mother!" Luo Tian's face showed a pleading expression, looking at Luo Xiong.

"Half a year later, I'll return. You are the hope of the entire Tianyuan continent. Don't risk it!" Luo Xiong decisively refused, his voice leaving no room for negotiation.

Seeing Luo Xiong's determined gaze, Luo Tian felt both angry and amused. Yet his heart was also warm.

"Grandfather, these are your two daughters-in-law. My father and mother haven't met them yet. Can you let us go back so they can meet?" Luo Tian, with no choice but to be shameless, brought up Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan.

"Respectful elder!" Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan glared at Luo Tian, then blushed as they bowed respectfully to Luo Xiong.

"Good! Haha!" Luo Xiong's face showed great joy upon seeing Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan. He subtly gave Luo Tian a thumbs-up.

Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan were both rare geniuses. Ordinarily, obtaining one would be a blessing from past lives. Now his grandson had two—this made Luo Xiong's old face light up with joy.

"Then can we leave now?" Luo Tian, seeing Luo Xiong's happiness, quickly took the opportunity.

"No! You won't get to leave!" Luo Xiong shook his head, raising his hand. Two jade bottles fell into his hands and were given to Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan.

"These two ninth-grade elixirs are a gift. Don't despise them. When you get married, if I'm still around, I'll definitely give more!" Luo Xiong spoke generously, giving two ninth-grade elixirs at once.

"Ah! Grandfather Luo is a treasure trove!" Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi's eyes shone as they looked at Luo Xiong. Then they understood.

Luo Xiong had spent years in the Xian Gu relics, his cultivation high. He hadn't been anywhere? The Xian Gu continent might have already been thoroughly explored by Luo Xiong.

"Take them," Luo Xiong saw Gu Qianxue's tension and softened his voice.

"Grandfather, is there really no way to negotiate?" Luo Tian smiled again, pleading desperately. He used shameless methods to argue with Luo Xiong for a long time.

Luo Xiong, perhaps having been in the Xian Gu relics too long and not spoken to anyone for a while, had a verbal battle with Luo Tian. Finally, he left his底线 (bottom line), saying that if Luo Tian could do it, he would let them go.

"Hmph. You son, if you can have a child now, I'll let you leave. Others, I don't care. Our Luo family can't be without descendants!" Luo Xiong finally waved his sleeve and returned to his hut, leaving the group stunned.

Chapter 683: Return to Tianyuan

Chapter 683: Return to Tianyuan

Luo Tian's group was stunned upon hearing Luo Xiong's condition. They hadn't expected him to propose such a harsh demand. Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan's faces were almost bleeding.

"Let's try," Luo Tian turned back, smiling bitterly at Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan.

"Go to hell..." They responded with anger. One kicked Luo Tian into the distance.

"Hmph, we dare not kick you grandfather, but we can kick you!" Gu Qianxue put her hands on her hips and pulled Leng Qiuchan, returning to the group.

"Alas..." Luo Tian sighed, returning to the front of the group. He didn't know what to do now.

"Jiang Xiong, what should we do?" Luo Tian turned to Jiang Nanxuan. Among the group, he believed Jiang Nanxuan had the most solutions.

"Wait a moment. Let me see," Jiang Nanxuan's brow furrowed, his face deep in thought. He indicated Menge to carry him into the sky.

"Higher!" Jiang Nanxuan and Meng'e stood in the sky, looking at the mountains below. His face showed a hint of joy.

"Higher... higher... another thousand zhang..." Jiang Nanxuan's voice kept giving commands. Though his tone was calm, Meng'e knew he was filled with excitement.

Finally, after rising three ten thousand zhang, Jiang Nanxuan's face showed a smile. He looked down.

"Let's go back. I think I have a way to return!" Jiang Nanxuan smiled, holding Meng'e's hand and speaking softly.

"How?" As soon as Jiang Nanxuan landed, Luo Tian's group surrounded him, their faces filled with hope. At this moment, Jiang Nanxuan had become their only hope of returning. If they truly couldn't go back, it would be difficult.

"I have a way!" Jiang Nanxuan smiled, speaking to the group with confidence.

"Wow..." Upon hearing Jiang Nanxuan's words, the crowd murmured in surprise, their faces showing joy.

"Did you find a way?" Luo Xiong sat on his wooden house, his old face showing a smile. His gaze turned deep.

"If I'm right, the terrain here is an natural teleportation array capable of supporting tens of thousands of people's transportation!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke with admiration, addressing Luo Tian's group.

"Everyone, follow me!" Jiang Nanxuan didn't explain but knew that explaining to these people would be futile. He indicated Meng'e to carry him into the sky again.

Luo Tian's group, seeing this, showed excitement. They all stood up and followed Jiang Nanxuan.

Under Jiang Nanxuan's guidance, Luo Tian's group flew to a small hill. Though it was called a small hill compared to other peaks, it could easily accommodate Luo Tian's thousands.

"This is it!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke, looking around the peaks and indicating that they had reached their destination.

"Prepare yourselves. I'll activate the array and take you all away!" Jiang Nanxuan smiled, speaking to the group.

"Ready anytime!"

"Hurry up. We've been out for so long, I miss home!" People murmured, their faces showing excitement.

Jiang Nanxuan didn't waste words. He indicated Meng'e to carry him into the sky, circling around the surrounding peaks. At the same time, countless golden banners flew out from Jiang Nanxuan's hands and were planted within ten thousand zhang of the area around Luo Tian's group.

After arranging for half an hour, Jiang Nanxuan and Meng'e returned to the small hill.

"Let's go!" Jiang Nanxuan waved his hand, sending ten golden banners into the air in different directions, surrounding the group.

As the banners fell, the world's energy seemed to be activated. If one looked from the sky, it would appear as if lines of energy converged toward the small hill where Luo Tian's group stood.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian's eyes showed reluctance, looking toward the direction of Luo Xiong's wooden house. If not for urgency, he would have stayed longer to keep company with Luo Xiong. After all, leaving Luo Xiong alone here was too lonely.

"Boy, you're leaving?" As Luo Tian felt sorrowful, Luo Xiong's voice echoed from the sky. In an instant, he appeared above Luo Tian's group.

"Grandfather, please don't block us!" Luo Tian knelt on his knees, his face showing determination.

Others saw Luo Xiong and their gazes changed. Their eyes carried tension, fearing Luo Xiong would block them.

"Go. Remember not to act recklessly. Listen to your father and mother, protect your life for me. If you must die, have a son first; otherwise, you don't deserve to die!" Luo Xiong spoke without blocking Luo Tian's group. He waved his hand, sending a storage bag into the array of Luo Tian's group and placing it in Luo Tian's hands.

"Yes!" Luo Tian nodded, his heart warmed. He bowed steadily to the sky above Luo Xiong.

Cold Qiuchan and Gu Qianxue also knelt on the ground, bowing with Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." The energy fluctuation spread. A powerful displacement force acted on the feet of Luo Tian's group.

Under Luo Xiong's emotional gaze, Luo Tian's group vanished from the spot and were transported out of the Xian Gu continent.

Under the displacement force, Luo Tian's group felt a dizzying rotation. Then they felt their feet light, landing on the ground.

As soon as they landed, everyone cautiously looked around. Upon seeing the familiar scenery, their faces showed joy.

"Haha! This is the Southern Region! We're back!" People shouted, returning to the Tianyuan continent after so long in the Xian Gu relics. It felt like a triumphant return home.

The location where Luo Tian's group landed was the place where the Xian Gu Dao Sect had appeared. It was also the central area of the Southern Region.

"Hey? What's happening with the moon?" Someone exclaimed, looking at the sky.

As people shouted, Luo Tian also looked up. His line of sight revealed that the moon was in a half-circle state, and more strangely, this half-moon had turned an eerie red.

"Tian Shi Sect!" Luo Tian's brow furrowed, whispering lowly. He thought of the Chronological Book within his body that had flown out before, which also had a blood-red moon. The difference was this one was a full moon.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian's words finished, he felt the Chronological Book in his mind tremble repeatedly. It seemed to want to fly out of Luo Tian's mind.

Chapter 684: To the Yelling Sect

Chapter 684: To the Yelling Sect

As Luo Tian's group was transported out, the entire Tianyuan continent trembled.

"Damn! How did they come out!" Sect elders all spoke, their gazes filled with anxiety.

Yin Tianxiong stood on a mountain peak. His face showed admiration, his eyes flashing with intense light as he looked toward Luo Tian's group and whispered: "They've come out. It's good! A nine-life reincarnation person truly surprises!"

"My disciple, he definitely didn't back down!" Zhang Daotian's three sub-bodies were distributed in three dangerous places. His face showed a smile as he spoke.

"Le Rong's soul lamp has gone out. I suppose she was killed in the Xian Gu relics. I'll see who dares to kill my Qionghua Sect's genius. Even if it's a top talent from another major sect, I won't let them go!" A senior woman of the Qionghua Sect who had reached Soul Consolidation and grasped a fragment of chaos power showed intense killing intent. Her face was filled with strong hatred.

"Only those few could threaten Le Rong. I'll see who moved the hand!" The old woman's hands moved slightly, wrapping a faint energy around an extinguished soul lamp.

"Buzz..." As this energy touched the soul lamp, images appeared in the old woman's mind.

"Five Elements Sect. Luo Tian. How bold! A mere genius of the Five Elements Sect dares to attack my Qionghua Sect's disciple. He really has the courage of a tiger!" The old woman's eyes were filled with killing intent, issuing commands one after another.

"Luo Xiong... farewell!"

"Luo Tian, if there's anything you need, don't hesitate to find me. Don't be shy about asking for help!" At this moment, people in the Xian Gu relics were saying goodbye to Luo Tian. They flew toward their sects.

Luo Tian also said his goodbyes, leaving contact information with everyone.

Cold Qiuchan was also reluctant but had to part from Luo Tian. After all, the priority was how to deal with the Tian Shi Sect. Returning to Yuling Sect would require a discussion with his father.

After people dispersed, only Luo Tian, Xu Liyi, and Chen Zhanbiao remained without sects.

Gu Qianxue and Gu Tai also stayed with Luo Tian's group, not choosing to return to the Yelling Sect.

"Where should we go next?" Gu Tai's face showed a hesitant expression as he asked Luo Tian.

"Of course back to the Northern Region! Are you stupid!" Xu Liyi rolled his eyes, showing mockery.

Because of Luo Tian's relationship, the group had a good rapport. Xu Liyi, Gu Tai, Zheng Xin, and Tian Luo were all like-minded, naturally familiar with each other. When they quarreled, others laughed and waited for Luo Tian's decision.

Gu Qianxue was somewhat quiet. Her eyes flickered slightly, then returned to gently looking at Luo Tian.

"Northern Region. Not yet,"

"We should go to the Yelling Sect first!" Luo Tian's lips slightly curled, his gaze looking toward Shangguan Hongtu and Xiu Jie's direction.

"Yelling Sect?" Xu Liyi's brow furrowed, his face showing confusion.

The Yelling Sect was a major sect in the Southern Region. Xu Liyi rarely went looking for trouble with it unless necessary.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Gu Qianxue and Gu Tai were shocked. Their faces showed gratitude but also dimmed.

"Luo Tian, maybe it's better not to," Gu Qianxue spoke softly. In the Xian Gu relics, Shangguan Hongtu and Luo Tian's relationship had clearly improved. She didn't want to let Luo Tian clash with the Yelling Sect over them.

"Nothing's wrong. After all, your mother is still at the Yelling Sect. It's better to retrieve her and reunite with Gu's father!" Luo Tian smiled, gently combing Gu Qianxue's hair.

It wasn't that Luo Tian feared the Yelling Sect. But with his current connections and strength, a Yelling Sect was nothing to fear.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian saw Gu Qianxue and Gu Tai's hesitant expressions. He smiled, nodding to the others.

A group of over ten people transformed into a long rainbow and flew toward the Yelling Sect.

The Yelling Sect, as a major sect in the Southern Region, wasn't located in remote areas. It was only several thousand miles away from the Xian Gu relics. With Gu Qianxue's guidance, they reached the Yelling Sect's sky in just two hours.

"Here is the Yelling Sect. Let's descend! The sky above the Yelling Sect doesn't allow flying," Gu Qianxue said with concern. She knew Luo Tian's character and understood the Yelling Sect's arrogance. If they met, it would definitely not end well.

"Ugh! This Yelling Sect really has a taste for the grotesque. They've even split the mountain in two!" Xu Liyi rolled his eyes, looking at the split Yelling Mountain and sighing.

"You don't know this. Once a woman wanted to seek justice for her son. She stood in the sky above Yelling Mountain, full of vigor and strength. With one sword she split Yelling Mountain in two. The elders of the Yelling Sect didn't even dare to say a word!" Tian Luo, who was doing nothing, followed Luo Tian's group to the Yelling Sect.

"Who is it? Daring to fly above my Yelling Sect, get down immediately!" A disciple of the Bone-Transformation realm at the Yelling Sect saw the group of ten and showed anger.

"Truly arrogant!" Luo Tian's group sighed softly, exchanging glances without descending. To them, these Bone-Transformation disciples were like ants.

"Northern Region's Five Elements Sect Luo Tian, here to pay respects!" Luo Tian smiled slightly and spoke softly. His calm voice echoed in the ears of the Yelling Sect's people.

At this moment, Shangguan Hongtu had just returned. His face was filled with endless pride. The Yelling Sect's disciples and elders looked at him with admiration and respect, even his father, the Yelling Sect's sect master, gazed at Shangguan Hongtu with satisfaction. His mouth almost stretched to his ears.

The hall was filled with joy, but when Luo Tian's voice echoed into their ears, the atmosphere in the hall slightly paused.

"Who? Who dares to come and provoke us at our Yelling Sect?"

"Truly bold! The Five Elements Sect's Luo Tian. A mere Five Elements Sect dares to provoke us at our Yelling Sect!" The disciples and elders in the hall showed anger, rushing toward the hall's entrance.

Among the crowd were an old man and two youths. Their eyes carried cold killing intent, following the crowd toward the outside. They were Shangguan Feihong and his two brothers, Shangguan Qingyu and Shangguan Qingfeng.

Chapter 685: Kill You All

Chapter 685: Kill You All

On the vast Yelling Mountain in the Southern Region of Tianyuan continent, Luo Tian stood calmly in the sky. Beside him were Tian Luo and Xu Liyi, their faces filled with tension.

"Luo Tian. I never thought he would dare to provoke us at our Yelling Sect!" Shangguan Feihong's face showed coldness. For years, Luo Tian had been a thorn in his side. These days he heard that Luo Tian had risen, but still didn't take him seriously. In just a few years, in Shangguan Feihong's view, with the Five Elements Sect's resources, it was a miracle to have Luo Tian reach the Soul Retrieval realm.

Shangguan Feihong was now at the Soul Retrieval mid-stage. His two nephews were even at the late stage of Soul Retrieval. How could they take Luo Tian seriously?

"Good, since you've come to provoke us, we'll kill you and it's justified!" Shangguan Feihong's face showed a cold expression. He quickly rushed toward the hall.

"Luo Tian! Damn!" Shangguan Hongtu heard Luo Tian's name and felt a shiver. He seemed to recall something.

"Don't attack Luo Tian!" Shangguan Hongtu knew that his disciples, even combined, weren't enough to kill Luo Tian.
