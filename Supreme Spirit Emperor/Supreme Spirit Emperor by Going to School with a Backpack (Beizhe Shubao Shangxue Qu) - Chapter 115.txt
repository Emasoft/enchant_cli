“Autumn Moon truly deserves his title as a master of forging weapons. His skill in this art must be unparalleled across the Tianyuan Continent!”

Zhang Daotian’s face bore an expression of admiration as he gazed upon Zhang Qiuyue, whose body emitted a continuous rumbling sound.

Zhang Qiuyue’s face now bore an air of solemnity, sweat gradually flowing down his face. His white robe fluttered under the invisible waves of energy.

Beneath that pale flame, the Splitting Sky Spear roared with thunderous sounds. The gray aura had completely collapsed under Zhang Qiuyue’s refinement, molded into the form of the spear.

“Merge with me!” Zhang Qiuyue barked, his hands clenching fiercely. The Splitting Sky Spear and the gray aura instantly fused together with a resounding hum, even causing Zhang Daotian’s barrier to tremble.

Zhang Qiuyue wore a faint smile as he addressed Luo Nantian: “It surpasses my expectations. This spear contains a fragment of a残缺的器魂 (defective weapon soul). If successful, with the aid of the unconscious Ice Dragon Soul’s repair, this spear should reach the Heavenly grade!”

Zhang Qiuyue stepped out of the barrier, yet that pale flame continued to burn fiercely upon the slightly blackened spear.

……

“One… two… five…” Luo Tian seemed to have forgotten time itself, gradually refining the Ice Dragon’s blood.

As Luo Tian refined it, his cultivation steadily ascended. The seven meridians formed by his seven soul essences radiated a crimson glow.

“Ten drops…” Finally, after refining ten drops of the Ice Dragon’s blood, Luo Tian suddenly opened his eyes. His hands fiercely grasped at the void, and within a hundred miles of the region, the qi converged abruptly.

“Crack…” Luo Tian’s body was enveloped in seven-colored halos. The meridians formed by his seven soul essences, like a child, continuously absorbed the surrounding qi.

“Soul Essence Peak! Merge!” Luo Tian coldly snorted, his body emitting thunderous sounds. His aura surged to the heavens.

“The Ice Dragon’s blood is indeed a treasure!” Luo Tian’s face bore joy, clearly feeling his current self had become an ultimate Soul Essence Peak powerhouse.

That joy flickered away instantly, and Luo Tian returned to a solemn expression. Though Soul Essence Peak was already immensely powerful, it wasn’t what Luo Tian sought. He aimed for the Ritual Soul Stage, becoming a pillar of his sect’s foundation—only then would he have the means to approach the Yiming Sect in the Southern Region.

With his abnormal physique and attributes, Luo Tian was confident that without a魂境 (Soul Stage) master intervening, and with the Splitting Sky Spear refined by his mother, he definitely had the means to escape from a Ritual Soul Peak opponent.

He sat cross-legged again, closing his eyes to refine the now slightly withered Ice Dragon’s heart.

“Excellent! Composed and unassuming!” Seeing Luo Tian calmly refining the Ice Dragon’s blood again, Zhang Daotian and the others wore satisfied expressions.

“The Splitting Sky Spear is complete!” Zhang Qiuyue let out a light laugh, directing his gaze toward the spear.

Zhang Qiuyue’s hands rapidly shifted, a sequence of runes forming into a black dragon that was imprinted onto the spear’s body, leaving Zhang Daotian astonished.

Zhang Qiuyue spent half an hour inscribing runes before stopping. The black runes flickered briefly on the spear.

When Zhang Qiuyue withdrew his hands, the Splitting Sky Spear emitted a thunderous roar. Its body even carried an aura of dragons.

“Hum…” The hums spread, and Zhang Qiuyue extinguished the white flame, wiping sweat from his face. His eyes carried satisfaction.

“Heavenly-grade spear!” Zhang Qiuyue let out a light laugh, pointing his finger at the Splitting Sky Spear.

“Hum…” The spear seemed to recognize Zhang Qiuyue, emitting a continuous hum. Zhang Daotian’s barrier was as fragile as paper before the spear, unable to hinder it at all. The spear instantly appeared before Zhang Qiuyue, landing in his hand.

Chapter 563: The Trial of the Mind's Demon

Chapter 563: The Trial of the Mind's Demon

After being pierced through his barrier by the Splitting Sky Spear, Zhang Daotian wore a joyous expression. He glanced at the spear in Zhang Qiuyue’s hand, nodding inwardly before speaking softly: “I must depart. You two have my trust!”

Hearing Zhang Daotian’s words, Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiuyue were stunned. Luo Nantian spoke: “Senior, are you truly determined to go to that place?”

“Indeed. It’s inevitable. If successful, it would be a crucial advantage for the upcoming war! Besides, I’m only sending my spiritual body. If it fails, I can simply abandon this form!” Zhang Daotian’s gaze was deep as he looked at Luo Tian seated in meditation, letting out a soft sigh.

“Respectfully send off the senior!” Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiuyue, having known Zhang Daotian well, naturally understood where he was going. They respectfully bowed to him.

“Enough. Take care of this boy well. Perhaps in the future, he’ll be the one to rely on! Also, upon your return to Ice Pole Island, consolidate the strength of Ice Pole Island. Constantly distinguishing between main and secondary will cause conflicts among the major families, even though they all share the Luo surname. Disagreements are inevitable!” Zhang Daotian spoke, giving them a final warning before walking towards the spatial exit.

With respectful expressions, Luo Nantian and his wife resumed their meditation to guard Luo Tian. Meanwhile, the Splitting Sky Spear stood upright on the icy surface, its tip radiating a cold glow.

Time slowly passed. In an instant, seven days had gone by.

“Ten… twenty… one hundred!” On the seventh day, Luo Tian finally completed refining a hundred drops of Ice Dragon’s blood.

At the moment the blood vanished completely, the entire Ice Dragon’s heart shattered within Luo Tian’s body.

Luo Tian opened his eyes. He felt his cultivation had reached the brink, needing just one more drop to break through the Soul Essence barrier and enter the Ritual Soul Stage.

“Come!” Luo Tian barked, and the qi in the world stilled for seven days suddenly surged again.

Fortunately, this was deep within Ice Pole Island. No one could have arrived here; if anyone had, they would’ve been awestruck by this overwhelming aura.

Luo Nantian and his wife were no different. However, their eyes showed great joy as they watched Luo Tian.

“See? That’s my son. Compared to when we entered the Ritual Soul Stage, his commotion is immeasurably greater!” Zhang Qiuyue wore a proud expression as he gazed at Luo Tian seated on the ground.

At the same time, several elders of Ice Pole Island’s sect sat in meditation within their ancestral hall. They all opened their eyes, gazing toward the depths of Ice Pole Island with admiration.

“Indeed a prodigy. He’s already breaking through to the Ritual Soul Stage so quickly!” The elders spoke in low voices, discussing among themselves.

Luo Tian, however, paid no heed to others’ feelings. He was like a ravenous beast, absorbing the influx of qi into himself. His body emitted continuous cracking sounds.

The seven-colored meridians transformed again into seven distinct soul essences, floating before Luo Tian and radiating a familiar aura.

“Golden Soul! Merge!” Luo Tian barked, his powerful soul essence instantly dividing into one-seventh of its size and merging with the golden soul essence.

“Wooden Soul! Merge! Water Soul…” Luo Tian’s barks continued, his soul essence gradually dispersing and gathering into the seven-colored soul essences.

“Others divide one soul into seven souls, but our son divides seven souls into seven souls! I wonder how powerful he’ll become upon entering the Ritual Soul Stage!” Luo Nantian gazed with admiration at the seven-colored soul essences and seven souls coalescing.

“Joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, hatred, desire!”

“Seven souls complete!” Luo Tian let out a low growl. His eyes became vacant, but the combination of seven soul essences and souls before him formed a figure resembling Luo Tian himself, each carrying different expressions as if he were the real thing.

Luo Tian’s mouth opened, and a series of soul-like seven souls exited his orifices, entering his body.

“Boom…” Thunderous sounds echoed in the sky. Though within a spatial rift, the thunderstorm seemed to know of Luo Tian’s presence, as dark clouds gradually pressed down into the rift.

“The thunderstorm has arrived!” Luo Nantian and his wife moved their hands slightly, forming a barrier with their combined effort. This was the method of a Soul Stage powerhouse to evade thunderstorms and find their way.

“Hum…” Luo Tian’s body underwent a strong transformation, his aura surging to the heavens. His long hair fluttered with the waves of energy.

“Crack…” Five-colored lightning streaked across the sky, instantly arriving above Luo Tian’s head. This caused Luo Tian to open his eyes.

“Thunderstorm, what can you do against me?” Luo Tian laughed loudly. He extended his hand to grasp the lightning as if catching a snake, snatching it into his palm.

“Absorb!” Luo Tian opened his mouth to suck in the five-colored lightning, which could instantly disintegrate a Soul Stage powerhouse. Yet Luo Tian remained unaffected, his eyes filled with provocation as he gazed at the gathering storm clouds.

The storm clouds seemed to sense Luo Tian’s power, realizing that the thunderstorm was no longer effective against him. Under Luo Tian’s gaze, they gradually dissipated.

Seeing Luo Tian repel even the thunderstorm, Luo Nantian and his wife wore a brief expression of joy. However, immediately after, Luo Nantian’s gaze turned solemn. He knew the next trial would be the greatest test for Luo Tian—the Trial of the Mind's Demon.

Indeed, as soon as Luo Nantian thought this, Luo Tian’s expression slightly changed. His eyes flickered with confusion, then solemnity, then joy, then anger.

Zhang Qiuyue also wore a worried expression as she watched Luo Tian. Naturally, she knew what Luo Tian was doing and dared not disturb him. However, with Luo Nantian’s help, they enclosed Luo Tian within a barrier.

“Roar!” After Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiuyue completed the barrier, Luo Tian’s eyes suddenly glowed red. He let out a loud roar and pounded his chest repeatedly, then as if not seeing the barrier at all, he rushed toward it like a meteor.

“This!” Zhang Qiuyue saw Luo Tian’s current state, her face involuntarily showing tension. At this moment, Luo Tian seemed truly terrifying.

“Mind demons are indeed fearsome. I wonder what Luo Tian’s mind demon is? Whether he can withstand it… Prepare yourself, just in case he fails to enter the Ritual Soul Stage!” Luo Nantian gently held his wife’s hand, his voice carrying solemnity.

“One hour… two hours…”

Under Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiuyue’s solemn gazes, Luo Tian’s eyes finally returned to normal. However, he spat out a mouthful of blood and whispered lowly: “Yunting!”

As soon as Luo Tian’s words finished, he collapsed unconscious. Subsequently, the storm clouds above reassembled.

Chapter 564: Halfway to Ritual Soul

Chapter 564: Halfway to Ritual Soul

“Failure!” Seeing the storm clouds reassemble above space, Luo Nantian and his wife wore expressions of shock.

The Ritual Soul Mind Demon—once an ascent fails, another thunderstorm would emerge to eliminate the weakened soul.

“You go and pull Tian into the barrier; I’ll handle the rest!” Luo Nantian stood with his sword, stepping out of the barrier.

“Be careful!” Zhang Qiuyue wore a worried expression. She extended her hand, pulling Luo Tian into the barrier while channeling water-elemental qi into his body.

“Boom…” The thunderstorm seemed to know of the change, emitting a deep rumble. The storm clouds gradually gathered.

“I’ll take it for my son!” Luo Nantian’s long hair fluttered, his body radiating boundless authority. His sword emitted a continuous hum.

“Boom…” In the next moment, black lightning streaked across the sky, striking Luo Nantian.

“Black Demon Lightning! Do you think it can harm me?” Luo Nantian roared, his sword emitting ten thousand feet of light. He fiercely slashed upward.

The overwhelming sword qi instantly shattered the unstable void, appearing before the black lightning.

“Crack…” A deafening sound echoed as sword qi and black lightning collided, instantly illuminating the sky. The destroyed palace from Luo Tian’s thunderstorm was completely reduced to rubble by the powerful fluctuations.

“Boom…” In the next moment, another thunderstorm gathered. A streak of gray lightning continuously wandered within the storm clouds.

“Chaos Thunder!” Seeing this gray lightning, Luo Nantian and his wife’s faces turned pale. Zhang Qiuyue even wanted to leave the barrier to join Luo Nantian in resisting.

Luo Nantian wore a bitter smile, his eyes filled with intense solemnity. As a Soul Stage powerhouse, he knew what this gray lightning represented.

This thunderstorm was one that only appears when ascending to the legendary界尊 (World Sovereign) stage. Once reaching Soul Stage peak, one would sense the terrifying chaos power through their qi.

According to common sense, anyone who grasps even a fragment of chaos power would enter the legendary World Sovereign stage. Only those who comprehend chaos power can withstand this terrifying chaos thunderstorm.

However, Luo Nantian was only at the middle of Soul Stage. How could he grasp chaos power that one must reach Soul Stage peak to comprehend? Under this thunderstorm, Luo Nantian was tenfold dead.

“Take care of your son!” Luo Nantian gazed at Zhang Qiuyue and Luo Tian, his face filled with reluctance. He then unleashed a fierce battle spirit, his sword pointing toward the gray lightning now as thick as a rope in the sky.

Luo Tian, at this moment, opened his eyes. His face was pale. Seeing his father standing there, he wore a look of confusion. Zhang Qiuyue’s tears fell onto his face, startling Luo Tian.

“Boom…” The heavy thunder sound awakened Luo Tian. His gaze followed the sky above.

“Fear!” As soon as Luo Tian saw the gray lightning, he felt fear arise within him.

“Son, I’ve never taught you anything. Since you were seven years old, I’ve given you no fatherly love. From today on, I can’t protect you anymore. Remember to take care of your mother!” Luo Nantian shouted at Luo Tian.

If Luo Tian didn’t understand what Luo Nantian was doing now, he would’ve lived in vain for these years. His eyes were instantly filled with tears. He moved like lightning toward the barrier’s exterior.

“Pound!” Zhang Qiuyue’s figure blocked Luo Tian’s path, grabbing him back.

“The thunderstorm has formed. If you go, it’ll be in vain!” Zhang Qiuyue spoke, her eyes filled with determination.

“No!” Luo Tian shouted at Zhang Qiuyue. However, at this moment, Luo Tian had fully awakened. His mind rapidly rotated, seeking a way to withstand the chaos thunderstorm.

“Chronicle of the Epoch!” Luo Tian could think of no other method. He only thought of this treasure, the Chronicle of the Epoch.

“Come out!” Luo Tian barked, his powerful spiritual awareness instantly rushing into his golden spiritual sea. He continuously pushed against the golden Chronicle of the Epoch.

Luo Tian’s current spiritual awareness had fully entered the Ritual Soul Stage. He could now cause considerable damage to the Chronicle of the Epoch.

Golden light slowly illuminated above Luo Tian’s head, turning the entire sky golden. The Chronicle of the Epoch, under Luo Tian’s desperate urging, slowly flew out from above his head.

“Go!” Luo Tian exerted all his strength, slapping the Chronicle of the Epoch. His eyes carried anticipation as he sent it flying toward the chaos thunderstorm descending from the sky.

At the moment Luo Tian launched the Chronicle of the Epoch, Zhang Qiuyue and Luo Nantian felt its presence. Their faces showed great shock.

Luo Tian had become like this because of the Chronicle of the Epoch. Now, it had flown out from his body again, leaving them in shock.

Luo Nantian seemed to have forgotten about the chaos thunderstorm. His gaze at Luo Tian was filled with concern.

“Crack…” A loud sound pierced through flesh and struck Luo Nantian’s spiritual essence, pulling him back to reality. His eyes showed joy.

The Chronicle of the Epoch stood above Luo Nantian, radiating brilliant golden light. Its pages continuously flipped and collided with the chaos thunderstorm.

Luo Nantian was delighted to find that the chaos thunderstorm, upon meeting the Chronicle of the Epoch, seemed to have encountered its nemesis. It lost interest in Luo Nantian and fiercely collided with the Chronicle of the Epoch.

“Rustle…” The pages of the Chronicle of the Epoch flipped continuously. Finally, they stopped on the second-to-last page. A powerful suction emerged from the Chronicle of the Epoch.

The chaos thunderstorm was instantly sucked into the Chronicle of the Epoch. The Chronicle of the Epoch, as if nothing had happened, closed itself under the shocked gazes of Luo Tian and his parents. It then flew back toward Luo Tian, entering his spiritual sea.

“Tian, that was…” Luo Nantian’s face bore deep concern as he asked.

Luo Tian wore a bitter smile. Naturally, he wouldn’t hide anything from his parents. He explained how he had obtained the Chronicle of the Epoch.

Even so, Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiuyue wore worried expressions. They felt the Chronicle of the Epoch was strange, but they dared not act rashly. They couldn’t determine what would happen if they took the Chronicle of the Epoch out.

“Enough! Tian’s fate is in his hands. Let’s think about what to do next. Tian, now you are essentially a Ritual Soul Stage powerhouse. Once you pass the Mind Demon Trial, you’ll be truly in the Ritual Soul Stage! I hope you can train here on Ice Pole Island!” Luo Nantian spoke, gazing at Luo Tian with emotion.

Chapter 565: The Path My Parents Walked

Chapter 565: The Path My Parents Walked

On the frigid Ice Pole Island, snow constantly drifted. Cold air was oppressive.

A lone figure carried a dark, glossy spear on his shoulders, walking through the icy wasteland.

After bidding farewell to his parents, Luo Tian walked from the depths of Ice Pole Island toward its sect. His face wore a smile. A killing aura radiated from his body, and his robes were scattered with blood, making the killing aura more intense.

After giving Luo Tian a few words of advice, Luo Nantian and his wife flew toward the sect of Ice Pole Island under Luo Tian’s respectful gaze.

“Dad, you really know how to give your son a hard time!” Luo Tian let out a bitter laugh. He climbed onto a mountain of ten thousand feet, whispering softly.

This journey from the depths of Ice Pole Island back to its sect was Luo Nantian’s test for Luo Tian—exactly the path his parents had taken when they first entered Ice Pole Island.

At first, Luo Tian thought it was nothing more than a harsh environment. After all, he had the碧晶琉璃火 (Bijin Liliu Fire), which could withstand this cold environment.

However, when Luo Tian encountered a white tiger-shaped beast at the Soul Essence Peak stage without forming a shape, he realized this path was not so easy.

Indeed, as Luo Tian walked further, the number of beasts increased. Fortunately, his power was extraordinary; otherwise, it would’ve been hard to go this far.

Along the way, Luo Tian had gained much. He didn’t know how many pieces of玄冰髓 (Xuanbing Sui) he had collected. Moreover, he felt his seven souls were more solid. Though not yet fully entering the Ritual Soul Stage, Luo Tian was confident that if he passed the Mind Demon Trial, he could successfully enter the Ritual Soul Stage.

Thinking of the Mind Demon Trial, Luo Tian felt even more bitter. His gaze carried nostalgia: “Yunting, I’ll definitely revive you!”

As he whispered, Luo Tian drove the Splitting Sky Spear into the icy mountain beneath his feet.

“Crack…” With one strike, it was no longer just a few feet of cracks. The entire ten thousand-foot icy mountain beneath Luo Tian’s feet was riddled with cracks, emitting continuous cracking sounds.

The most satisfying thing for Luo Tian was the Splitting Sky Spear. It had successfully reached the Heavenly grade. This was the first time Luo Tian had seen a Heavenly-grade treasure. Now, the Splitting Sky Spear even possessed its own consciousness. It clung to Luo Tian’s hand with intense affection. Luo Tian felt the spear was like a part of his body.

“Pound!” Luo Tian kicked the cracked icy mountain with force.

With Luo Tian’s footstep, the ice mountain devastated by the Splitting Sky Spear collapsed with a thunderous roar. Ice shards scattered in all directions.

Luo Tian’s body soared like an eagle from the depths of ten thousand feet, falling without spreading his wings. His entire body crashed onto the ground.

“Crack…” The solid ice surface cracked again under Luo Tian’s impact.

Blue light flared. Cold air radiated from the cracks, causing Luo Tian to wear a brief smile. Following the principle of “take what you can,” Luo Tian had not spared any icy mountain over a thousand feet. Any that exceeded this size would be his target.

He grabbed the blue Xuanbing Sui and placed it into a jade box, then stored it in his storage ring.

“Roar! Human!” As Luo Tian was about to leave, a deafening roar made him immediately alert. His face wore solemnity. He pushed off the ground, instantly leaping a hundred feet away.

“Pound!” As soon as Luo Tian disappeared, a snow-white figure appeared before him.

It had white fur. Its body was dozens of feet tall, with clouds of white vapor spewing from its blood-red mouth. Its crimson eyes made one feel an instinctive chill.

Luo Tian had to lift his head to see the face of this massive creature. It was a white bear-shaped beast.

What made Luo Tian wary was that this bear could speak human language. Naturally, he knew what it meant for a beast to be able to speak.

“Long have I watched you. Hand over the Xuanbing Sui, or I’ll be ruthless!” The white bear spoke, its voice vibrating Luo Tian’s eardrums.

Hearing the white bear’s words, Luo Tian wore a solemn expression. At the same time, he sighed inwardly: “I’ve encountered bandits!”

Thinking of Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbao, Luo Tian guessed that if they were here now, they would definitely fight this white bear.

After walking through Ice Pole Island for so long, Luo Tian gradually understood that Xuanbing Sui was a fatal temptation to these ice-element beasts. This was why he had been attacked by beasts all along the way.

However, this white bear was clearly much more advanced than other beasts. It even knew to wait until Luo Tian collected enough Xuanbing Sui before striking. Its intelligence was comparable to humans.

“Want the Xuanbing Sui? Dream on!” Luo Tian let out a cold laugh. Naturally, he wouldn’t hand over the Xuanbing Sui. His hands pointed the Splitting Sky Spear toward the bear, emitting a golden aura.

Luo Tian was not yet in the Ritual Soul Stage. However, his methods and qi were no different from those of a Ritual Soul Stage powerhouse. This was why Luo Nantian had dared to let Luo Tian return alone.

“Leave…” The white bear waved its hand, dispersing the golden aura. It looked at Luo Tian with two large eyes like lanterns, as if angry.

“Since you won’t give it to me, I’ll have no choice but to kill you. You’re too thin to fill my stomach!” The white bear spoke, then slammed its massive paw toward Luo Tian.

“If I kill this bear, it’ll be enough for Zhanbao to eat for a while!” Luo Tian saw the white bear’s massive body and let out a sigh.

Along this journey, Luo Tian no longer left the beasts he killed behind. Instead, he collected all their corpses to become food for Chen Zhanbao in the future.

Though the white bear seemed clumsy, its massive paw was incredibly fast. With each wave of its palm, cracks in the void appeared behind it and then slowly healed.

Luo Tian didn’t dare to be careless. He immediately activated the Six Steps of Sealing Heaven, leaving a phantom image and appearing ten thousand feet away.

“Pound!” The white bear’s paw struck the ground, creating a crater ten feet wide. This made Luo Tian deeply shocked. His face then brimmed with battle spirit as he gripped the Splitting Sky Spear and unleashed three spear techniques, rushing toward the white bear’s massive body.

With the Splitting Sky Spear now in the Heavenly grade, its three spear techniques had transformed into overwhelming power. Compared to when Luo Tian used them before, it was like the difference between heaven and earth.

“Golden serpents, golden waves, golden spear shadows!” The three techniques surged toward the white bear with overwhelming might.

Chapter 566: Shooting Explosion

Chapter 566: Shooting Explosion

The three spear techniques struck the white bear’s massive body, emitting thunderous sounds.

“Stomp… stomp… stomp…” The white bear’s mountain-like body took a few steps back. Though only a few steps, it had reached ten thousand feet away. The white bear’s face wore an expression of human-like surprise, its large eyes revealing a hint of solemnity.

The white bear felt pain in the areas struck by the three spear techniques. As a beast, it naturally knew how strong its body was. This human, smaller than a grasshopper compared to itself, had managed to make it retreat and even suffer minor injuries. This showed the boy was no pushover.

Luo Tian was also astonished, not expecting his three spear techniques to merely make the white bear retreat without causing any substantial damage.

“Boy! You’ve got some moves. In these years, few have made me retreat. The last time was a couple decades ago when a pair of humans passed by and almost killed me! So, you humans should all die!” The white bear spoke, its voice vibrating Luo Tian’s eardrums.

“Couple?” Luo Tian’s mouth twitched involuntarily. Without a doubt, the white bear was referring to his parents—Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiuyue.

“Meeting a beast that escaped from my parents’ hands is quite an experience,” Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He moved his body, instantly appearing before the white bear and launching a punch of life destruction toward it.

“Die!” Seeing Luo Tian dare to fight him head-on, the white bear let out a cold snort. Its massive fist struck toward Luo Tian.

“Pound!” The collision between one human and one beast created a deafening sound. In the next moment, Luo Tian’s body was like a cannonball, flying backward with no surprise but instead excitement.

“Looks like my physical body has truly reached the Ritual Soul Stage!” Luo Tian calculated inwardly.

The white bear also took a few steps back, as if the collision had fully ignited its anger. A fierce aura radiated from it. Its thick legs stomped, instantly collapsing the icy surface beneath.

“Pound… pound… pound…” The white bear repeatedly struck, continuously pounding Luo Tian.

Seeing the angry white bear, Luo Tian dared not be careless. After all, it was a Ritual Soul Stage beast, while he was merely half-trained.

His body moved swiftly. With the steps of Sealing Heaven, he dodged the white bear’s attacks like a dancer.

Each time the white bear’s paw struck, it shattered the icy surface. Countless ice shards floated around one human and one beast.

Feeling the battle between one human and one beast, surrounding Soul Stage ice-element beasts all let out groans. They lay prostrate on the ground, not daring to move an inch.

“Huff…” After attacking for a quarter of an hour, the white bear took a breath. It gazed at Luo Tian.

“Have guts and don’t run, kid!” The white bear sneered at Luo Tian.

“Truly comparable to human intelligence. It even knows how to provoke!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly while his body flew into the air, stepping on the void and retreating.

“Water Dragon Bow!”

“Splitting Sky Spear!” Luo Tian whispered, the Splitting Sky Spear and Water Dragon Bow both appearing in his hands.

When the two treasures appeared in Luo Tian’s hands, he had already positioned himself five thousand feet away from the white bear.

“Kid, you still run!” Seeing Luo Tian’s continuous retreat, the white bear roared. It then opened its blood-red mouth, emitting a powerful suction.

“Suck!” Under this suction, strong winds blew from Luo Tian’s front. Snow and ice within a hundred miles were continuously drawn into the white bear’s mouth.

“What is this?” Luo Tian wore confusion. He admired the white bear’s strength while wondering what it intended.

Luo Tian only thought for a moment before placing the Splitting Sky Spear on the Water Dragon Bow. Seven-colored qi continuously gathered onto the bow.

“Creak…” Luo Tian slowly drew back the Water Dragon Bow, adjusting the Splitting Sky Spear’s angle. Finally, he aimed its tip at the white bear’s eyes, which were like lanterns.

“Huh?” As soon as the Splitting Sky Spear locked onto him, the white bear felt a strong sense of danger. Its instinct told it that a powerful threat surrounded it.

“Suck!” Feeling the threat, the white bear again forcefully sucked in. This time, all the ice-elemental qi in the world seemed to be drawn out by the white bear’s suction.

“Die!” Luo Tian let out a cold laugh. He loosened the bowstring, which had been drawn to its maximum.

“Hum…” A humming sound came from Luo Tian’s hands. The Splitting Sky Spear transformed into a seven-colored dragon, rushing toward the white bear.

“Roar!” Feeling the threat approaching, the white bear stopped breathing. It let out a loud roar, and snow power from its mouth flew out, forming a white snow dragon to rush toward Luo Tian.

“Boom…” In an instant, the Splitting Sky Spear and the snow dragon collided. A thunderous sound echoed, making the void unstable. The sky was riddled with cracks.

Though the white bear’s strength was formidable, the Splitting Sky Spear had now reached the Heavenly grade. Even Zhang Daotian’s barrier at Soul Stage was pierced by it. How could a Ritual Soul Stage beast like the white bear withstand it?

This snow dragon, though seemingly a martial technique, was merely something the white bear had imitated and studied. Its power was great but could not withstand the Splitting Sky Spear.

“Pound!” The Splitting Sky Spear seemed unstoppable. For every foot it advanced, the snow dragon was shattered by its ultimate destructive power.

“Swoosh…” Wind surged. The Splitting Sky Spear instantly reached the white bear’s eyes.

Closing his eyes, the white bear’s first instinct was to close them. However, it wasn’t fast enough for the Splitting Sky Spear.

“Plop…” A dull sound echoed. The Splitting Sky Spear’s cold glinting tip pierced the white bear’s right eye and exited.

“Roar…” A piercing roar echoed across Ice Pole Island.

Luo Tian instinctively shivered. Before his eyes, the white bear’s right head exploded and blood spurted.

“Hum…” The Splitting Sky Spear emitted a happy hum, landing steadily in Luo Tian’s hand. Its entire body was stained red with the white bear’s blood.

But as soon as Luo Tian held the spear, his face slightly changed. His eyes then glowed with intense light. He closed them briefly.

Chapter 567: The Spear Master of the Sky

Chapter 567: The Spear Master of the Sky

“Roar…” A piercing roar echoed from the white bear. Its mountain-like body continuously rolled on the ground, colliding with surrounding icy mountains.

Luo Tian at this moment seemed unaware. His eyes were closed, standing in the sky with the Splitting Sky Spear radiating light, as if communicating with him.

“You must die… you must die…” The white bear’s pain had slightly subsided. However, it was now in a pitiful state.

Its white fur was half-stained with blood. Its massive head, the size of a house, had been pierced halfway. Though it no longer spurted blood, it still flowed slowly. The ground within a thousand feet was stained red with the white bear’s blood.

“Roar…” The white bear roared toward the sky, its massive body radiating a blood-stained aura. It rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Ten thousand feet… one thousand feet… one hundred feet…” The white bear’s figure instantly appeared before Luo Tian.

The white bear’s furious collision would annihilate any Soul Stage powerhouse. Not only would they be crushed, but the white bear’s overwhelming aura alone could crush any Soul Stage.

But just as the white bear was about to collide with Luo Tian, Luo Tian suddenly opened his eyes. His eyes glowed with intense light. The Splitting Sky Spear emitted a low hum, and waves of qi wrapped it.

Seeing the white bear approaching closely, Luo Tian’s mouth slightly curled upward. In an instant, he held the Splitting Sky Spear and pointed its tip toward the sky.
