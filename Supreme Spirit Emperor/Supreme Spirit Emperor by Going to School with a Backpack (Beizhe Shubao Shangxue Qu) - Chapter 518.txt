Ye Liangchen was the treasure of the entire Star River Mansion. If Ye Wudao had already spoken, and yet Ye Liangchen still suffered humiliation, it would directly provoke the wasp's nest.

"I abide by the rules of the Nine Immortal Mountains!" The old man spoke, his voice carrying a sense of委屈 (disgrace), but there was no alternative. He could only seek other methods.

Someone spoke, and the remaining four naturally ceased their harassment of Luo Tian, returning to their own people. Their eyes were fixed on Luo Tian with murderous intent, as if they wished to devour him whole.

"Kid, you can't escape. Even if Star River Mansion protects you, they can't protect you for life!" Huang Tiande's face twisted with a cold smile. At this moment, he understood that Luo Tian's bow was the Bow of Shooting the Sun, the very one Huang Youshan had acquired.

"Many want to kill me, but what are you?" Luo Tian replied directly. Though he was no match for them, his mouth could not yield.

"Thank you, elder!" Luo Tian bowed slightly, offering a respectful gesture to Ye Wudao. To be rescued at this moment meant Ye Wudao was a man of his word.

"Brother Liangchen, thank you as well!" Luo Tian then clasped his fists toward Ye Liangchen, his gaze also turning to Nan Gong Yuqing and the others.

"Haha, Tian Ge, brother, don't speak of outsiders. You really showed your strength today, defeating a Late-stage True Immortal! In the future, be sure to look after me!" Ye Liangchen laughed loudly, his voice grating and his demeanor arrogant.

"Brother Liangchen, after I settle this matter, I will visit Star River Mansion to speak with you at length!" Luo Tian spoke loudly, then turned toward the combatants of the two sects who had ceased fighting.

At this moment, the combined forces of the two sects numbered no more than two million, a far cry from the several million before. On the battlefield, blood flowed in rivers, dyeing the Huan Tian Sea red. The crimson hue would not fade for a long time.

Above the sky, two Late-stage True Immortals had been crushed by Zang Yunfei and his three companions, leaving only a few Early-stage True Immortals and two Mid-stage True Immortals.

"At this point, do you still wish to resist?" Luo Tian spoke loudly, his gaze sweeping over the trembling disciples of Guiyuan Sect. The outcome was now certain.

"According to past precedents, we should completely annihilate you to eliminate future threats. However, Shenglong Sect has also suffered heavy losses. The sect needs development. I will grant you a chance at life, but with some restrictions imposed upon you!" Luo Tian spoke loudly, surrounded by the crowd. At this moment, Luo Tian's status among Shenglong Sect disciples surpassed even Zang Yunfei and the three elders.

"Of course, you may choose not to surrender. I can also grant you a dignified death—self-inflicted!" Luo Tian did not wait for their response, offering them another path. In truth, his words were elegant, but he truly did not wish for Shenglong Sect to lose another life.

After this battle, whether it was the Five Palaces or ordinary inner and outer disciples, those who survived were undeniably elite.

Above the sky, many Shenglong Sect disciples remained standing—Xuan Dan, Li Changfeng, and others Luo Tian knew were still present. Their gazes turned toward Luo Tian.

This battle's merits belonged entirely to Shenglong Sect, with Luo Tian slaying Guiyuan Daozi, killing a Late-stage True Immortal with the Bow of Shooting the Sun, and forcing Guiyuan Sect's secret weapon, the Mountain of Sea, to surrender. Each act was a major achievement.

"Surrender!" The disciples of Guiyuan Sect deliberated for a moment but ultimately chose to surrender. Better to live in disgrace than die. Moreover, Luo Tian had promised that as long as they did not betray the sect, he would not use the restrictions harshly.

A chorus of surrender cries filled the air, but a few chose suicide. In this battle, they had lost family and brothers, and Shenglong Sect was their enemy.

"Grand Elder, the rest is up to you!" Luo Tian exhaled deeply, his gaze turning toward Zang Yunfei and the others.

"Shenglong Sect has succeeded in its Struggle for Heaven!" Zang Yunfei, Si Ma Xiu, and Peng Tiande roared into the sky, their voices filled with excitement.

"Roar..." The entire Shenglong Sect erupted in a roar, their voices shaking the heavens. Cheers echoed endlessly.

"Back then, when we succeeded in our Struggle for Heaven, it was also like this!" The surrounding sects that had previously succeeded in their Struggle for Heaven bore expressions of nostalgia.

"Shenglong Sect, if possible, help whenever you can!" The sects that had previously succeeded in their Struggle for Heaven murmured quietly, recalling their own hardships and understanding the difficulty of a Struggle for Heaven.

The thunderous cries rose one after another, this battle having been incredibly arduous for Shenglong Sect. It had nearly failed; if not for Luo Tian's final reversal, killing the Late-stage True Immortal, the outcome would have been uncertain.

People continued to roar, releasing their excitement and easing the tension that had gripped them for a month.

"Luo Tian, Shenglong Sect has been destroyed!" As the crowd cheered, a streak of purple light burst from the throng. A small purple bird flew directly toward Luo Tian, its voice filled with urgency.

"Die Dezu! What's happening!" Luo Tian waved his hand, the cheers ceasing abruptly. He gazed at Die Dezu, who looked utterly disheveled, his heart sinking.

"They slaughtered all of Shenglong Sect's remaining people!"

"Now, only Xue Yushan and her child with Zuoqiu Ming remain alive!" Die Dezu spoke directly, recounting the entire incident.

"What!" Upon hearing Die Dezu's words, Zang Yunfei and the others' faces instantly turned furious. Shenglong Sect disciples halted their cheers, their eyes bloodshot and bodies trembling violently. The world fell into a deathly silence, save for heavy breathing.

"Where is your wife?" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with cold light, his voice as frigid as the depths of hell.

"She fled. I escaped when they weren't looking and, after recovering from my injuries, used the transmission array to enter Central Three Heavens and arrived here!" Die Dezu replied.

"Ah..."

"My wife, my son!" All Shenglong Sect disciples howled in despair, their voices filled with anguish. Their eyes were blood-red.

"Blood Dragon Pavilion, I bear you no grudge!"

"Grand Elders, let's return to the Lower Three Heavens and avenge ourselves!" Disciples cried out loudly, even the attendants' eyes turned blood-red. They too had family left behind in Shenglong Sect, and now they were all wiped out!

"Crash..." As Shenglong Sect mourned, waves rose in Huan Tian Sea, a fleet of massive warships cutting through the blood-red waters and appearing before the crowd.

"What's going on? Why has someone crossed Huan Tian Sea again?" Everyone was puzzled, gazing at the ships.

"I am the Chaos-Defying Sect, Struggle for Heaven!" As people puzzled, a Struggle for Heaven Seal hovered in the sky. The playful voice caused everyone's faces to show confusion.

"Guang Hongsheng!" Recognizing the man at the forefront, people's faces changed.

"Blood Dragon Pavilion, Purple幽阁 (Purple Obscure Hall), Wangxian Sect..." Li Changfeng and others spoke one after another, their gazes turning toward the people behind Guang Hongsheng.

"You!" Zang Yunfei and the two elders' eyes flashed with coldness, seeing the Struggle for Heaven Seal they had previously thrown. They hadn't expected these people to have come so swiftly.

"As long as one holds the Struggle for Heaven Seal, they may participate in the Struggle for Heaven. Is this not within the rules?" Guang Hongsheng's gaze swept over the severely wounded Shenglong Sect disciples and those who had just surrendered from Guiyuan Sect.

"Luo Tian!" Soon after, Luo Tian saw the crowd surrounding him and his mind trembled, recalling the Dragon's Soul (Longque).

Chapter 1990: We Have Come to Struggle for Heaven ()

"Guang Hongsheng, have you no memory? You've come out again!" Luo Tian panted heavily, his gaze also turning toward Guang Hongsheng.

Luo Tian hadn't expected Guang Hongsheng to appear at this moment, and even more so with such a display. His heart sank.

"Ah... Mu Xunyun, I'll kill you!" Seeing Mu Xunyun behind Guang Hongsheng, thousands of Shenglong Sect disciples surged forward toward Guang Hongsheng's group.

"Return!" Zang Yunfei and the two elders shouted immediately, but the disciples had been consumed by hatred. Their eyes were wild, having already cast aside life and death in the Struggle for Heaven. Now, their only focus was hatred—Mu Xunyun alone.

"Die!" Mu Xunyun sneered, stepping forward to meet the thousands of Heavenly Immortal disciples charging toward him. His blood-red long sword was drawn.

"Buzz..." The blade's radiance surged, like a crescent of blood, slicing through the thousands.

One strike shattered the heavens; the blood-red blade severed space, instantly submerging the thousands in its terrifying radiance.

"Luo Tian, I didn't expect this! You've been tricked again. Let that sparrow come out, and today I'll see how your sparrow resists my two million disciples!" Guang Hongsheng spoke loudly, his voice filled with grotesque joy.

"Haha, if Longque's master were here, even a single sigh would kill you!" Luo Tian's mind sneered but his face remained calm.

"Kill!" Shenglong Sect disciples roared, their eyes blood-red as they gazed at Guang Hongsheng.

"By what means do you think you can challenge Shenglong Sect's Struggle for Heaven? Today, blood must be paid with blood!" Zang Yunfei's eyes were crimson as he leapt into the air.

"We are indeed no match for your Late-stage True Immortals, but do you think I'll fall twice?" Guang Hongsheng's eyes flashed with hatred, then he gazed toward the void.

"Slam!" The heavens tore open, three elders emerging from the sky. Their gazes carried authority; one elder radiated overwhelming power, but his eyes were vacant.

"Thanks to you, I once fled like a dog. My greatest wish was to flatten Shenglong Mountain and kill every disciple of Shenglong Sect before your eyes!" Guang Hongsheng's gaze was cold.

"These three are the zombies I cultivated. As for how their strength rose to this level, you should know well!" Guang Hongsheng's face bore a smile.

The three elders had disheveled hair, one at the Mid-stage of Immortal, one a Late-stage True Immortal, and another a Late-stage True Immortal. Their strength was terrifying.

"One more gift I wish to give you!" Guang Hongsheng waved his hand, and a series of storage bags flew from his grasp.

"Boom... Boom..." The bags exploded in the sky above Huan Tian Sea, revealing a series of heads floating into the air. Each head fell toward Huan Tian Sea, their faces familiar to Shenglong Sect disciples. Some still had open eyes, filled with terror.

"Brutal!" Even the people of Central Three Heavens trembled, their gazes toward Guang Hongsheng now changed.

"Guang... Hong... Sheng..." Luo Tian gritted his teeth, as if struck by something in his chest. His teeth crushed several, and his eyes flashed a crimson light.

"Roar..." The ghost king transformed from an elder roared into the sky, his form shifting into a shadowy specter. He rushed toward Guang Hongsheng, waves of black qi surging as he threw a punch.

"Crack..." Guang Hongsheng's face bore a cold smile, but he did not move. Instead, the Late-stage True Immortal zombie standing above blocked the ghost king's path and also threw a punch.

"Boom..." Thunder rolled, Huan Tian Sea violently churning.

"Shenglong Sect disciples, follow me into battle!" Zang Yunfei and the others, their eyes also filled with fury, rushed toward Guang Hongsheng's group.

"At this moment, the three regretted deeply, regretting they had not left the Struggle for Heaven Seal. If they hadn't, Guang Hongsheng would never have come this far!"

They had never expected anyone to dare oppose Shenglong Sect, and thus they had caused this disaster.

"Exhausted, what else do you have?" Guang Hongsheng sneered, waving his hand toward those behind him.

"Kill!" Shenglong Sect disciples roared, their eyes blood-red. Their sole purpose was revenge; they would die for it.

"Return!" As people rushed out, a cold voice rang out. Luo Tian flew before them, his eyes bloodshot.

"Little Sect Leader!" Shenglong Sect disciples halted their bodies, gazing at Luo Tian with confusion. If it were anyone else blocking them, they would have crushed him without hesitation. But Luo Tian was different.

"This matter is my fault. I've dragged all of you into it. I, Luo Tian, will kneel before you! The rest is up to me!" After speaking, Luo Tian fell to his knees before the crowd.

At this moment, it felt as if his heart was being torn apart; his eyes flashed with madness. He struggled to maintain the last of his clarity.

If it weren't for him destroying Guang Hongsheng's Chaos-Defying Sect and thus making an enemy of him, allowing Guang Hongsheng to escape, this would not have happened.

Luo Tian's life had never desired others to die because of him. Now, so many Shenglong Sect disciples had died because of him—especially the weak and elderly. This had completely driven Luo Tian mad; his hatred was no less than anyone else's.

"Return, rest and recover. The rest is up to me. Shenglong Sect can no longer afford more losses!" Luo Tian spoke calmly, but his voice was unyielding.

"Little Sect Leader! We do not blame you! We only seek to kill our enemies!" Shenglong Sect disciples cried out, gazing at Luo Tian kneeling on the ground, his aura surging.

"Return! The rest is up to me. You are the elites of Shenglong Sect; you must not die anymore!" Luo Tian slowly rose. He had rarely knelt in his life, but this time he did so.

"Prepare! Luo Tian is about to go mad. If necessary, ignore the rules of the Nine Immortal Mountains and wash Huan Tian Sea with blood!" Nan Gong Yuqing spoke, his aura surging.

"Buzz..." Purple light flickered as Luo Tian grabbed Die Dezu and tossed him before Nan Gong Yuqing and the others.

"Take care! Do not intervene!" Luo Tian transmitted to Nan Gong Yuqing, his voice carrying an unyielding tone.

Nan Gong Yuqing and the others' bodies trembled slightly, gazing at Luo Tian's bloodshot eyes. They nodded, knowing that Luo Tian had his reasons for not allowing them to intervene.

"Crash..." Luo Tian grabbed a handful of pills and swallowed them, then took flight toward Guang Hongsheng. His golden spear pointed directly at him.

"Guang Hongsheng, come forth and fight!" His cold voice echoed through the heavens, shaking everyone's minds.

"Earlier, he had already exhausted much of his strength by killing a Late-stage True Immortal. Though he had taken pills, what did he have to oppose?"

"Boom... Boom..." As Luo Tian called for battle, Zang Yunfei, Si Ma Xiu, and Peng Tiande had already activated three top-grade immortal artifacts, clashing with the Late-stage True Immortal.

Li Changfeng and others also surrounded the Mid-stage True Immortal, subduing the three zombies.

"By what means do you think you can block my two million troops? What is your strength?" Guang Hongsheng sneered.

"Master, I will kill him!" Mu Xunyun saw Luo Tian and his eyes flashed with bloodlust. Since he had previously let Die Dezu and Xue Yushan escape, he had already incurred Guang Hongsheng's displeasure. Now, he sought to atone for his sins.

"Go!" Guang Hongsheng stood on the warship, smiling and waving his hand. The disciples from the three sects also took flight, over two million in number, like locusts swarming toward the coast.

These disciples did not know why three sects had united and renamed themselves Chaos-Defying Sect, but they knew they were Struggling for Heaven. Though some found it disgraceful, entering Central Three Heavens was worth the gamble. And since their master had ordered it, they could not disobey.

"Sorry!"

"Though I have disturbed your rest again, I had no choice. The souls of Shenglong Sect disciples, if you have not gone far, return and kill our great enemy to protect Shenglong Sect!" Luo Tian gazed at the two million charging toward him, his eyes deep. An invisible wave radiated from his body.

"Buzz..." Invisible waves spread from Luo Tian's surroundings, powerful spiritual force sweeping outward.

"Ten zhang... One hundred zhang... Ten thousand zhang..." The wave spread, and waves of gray mist rose from the surface of Huan Tian Sea. Their energy gradually coalesced, drifting over the sea's surface.

"Eight Directions of Evil Ghosts, heed my command!" Luo Tian's hands moved swiftly, a black crescent moon hovering above his head. It transformed into a swirling vortex.

"Roar..." Black ghosts emerged from the Ghost Summoning Seal, though it was daytime, black clouds obscured the sun. The entire Huan Tian Sea became filled with an eerie atmosphere. Combined with the previous blood qi, it transformed the world into a mysterious hell.

Countless souls and ghosts filled the heavens and earth, their eyes burning with intensity toward Luo Tian.

This place had long been a battlefield for Struggles for Heaven, with countless dead. Thus, it was also a place of great darkness. Luo Tian had just remembered this.

"Go!" Luo Tian pointed his finger, and countless souls and ghosts surged toward the disciples of the three sects charging toward Huan Tian's coast.

"Powerful!"

"He actually commands souls and ghosts!" Everyone was stunned, not expecting Luo Tian to have such a technique.

Countless residual souls and ghosts descended like divine punishment, blocking the disciples of the three sects. Luo Tian moved among them, his form flickering as he brandished his crackling spear toward Mu Xunyun.

"Die!" The blood sword swung, and Mu Xunyun's face twisted with grotesque joy. In his mind, he could easily crush Luo Tian; after all, Luo Tian was merely a Late-stage Heavenly Immortal. He himself was a True Immortal.

Chapter 1991: Guang Hongsheng's Power ()

The golden crackling spear clashed with the blood-red long sword, and a powerful explosion echoed in people's ears. Both men retreated simultaneously, Luo Tian spitting blood but his eyes flashing with radiant light.

"Shaking Immortal Eight Styles!" Luo Tian roared, drawing the Shaking Immortal Brush. He waved it repeatedly, and five large characters thundered down toward Mu Xunyun.

"Go away..." Mu Xunyun roared, his sword radiating blood-red slashes.

Boom... Boom...

The heavy explosions echoed endlessly. Each golden character was severed by Mu Xunyun, but his body continuously retreated, his face pale.

"Another top-grade immortal artifact! Now he has four!" People were stunned, gazing at Luo Tian with the bow.

"Die!" Mu Xunyun had just dispersed five characters, but he didn't care about the crackling spear's attack. However, he had to be cautious against Shaking Immortal Eight Styles.

"Kill..." Mu Xunyun was about to charge toward Luo Tian when three golden arrows shot through the sky, directly targeting Mu Xunyun.

Mu Xunyun's face suddenly changed; he felt a strong danger on the three arrows. He had no time to dodge, so he raised his blood-red long sword in front of him.

"Boom..." The moment the sword was raised, a thunderous explosion echoed from Mu Xunyun's chest. His body immediately retreated, blood spilling from his mouth.

"Boom..." The second explosion followed closely, golden arrow feathers exploding and Mu Xunyun's mouth spewing blood wildly. His face was as pale as paper.

The third explosion rang out, a crackling sound rising from Mu Xunyun's chest. The blood-red long sword rapidly collapsed into his chest.

"Three arrows, severely wounding a Mid-stage True Immortal! This kid is truly defying heaven!"

"He's not even at his full strength. If he had used the Giant God Array to kill the Late-stage True Immortal, it would have been a bit of trickery. But now, this is truly his strength!" The masters of the Central Three Heavens bore expressions of admiration.

"Is he not using a top-grade immortal artifact now?" Some prodigies showed discontent.

"If it were you, after a month-long battle, and given a top-grade immortal artifact now, could you severely wound a Mid-stage True Immortal?" However, their elders' words silenced the prodigies.

"Don't be afraid. A Heavenly Immortal is still a Heavenly Immortal. True Immortals are the key to cultivation. Only if a True Immortal defies heaven can they truly establish themselves in the Central Three Heavens!" The sect masters comforted the prodigies.

"This kid is truly a freak. In the Lower Three Heavens, he has grown to this level! A Heavenly Immortal below him is almost unbeatable. And with four top-grade immortal artifacts, you will never be his match!"

"Probably only the prodigies from the Nine Immortal Mountains could rival him! If you all had four top-grade immortal artifacts and our sect's martial arts, you might have a chance!" The masters spoke, believing Luo Tian was unquestionably the top among True Immortals.

"Ah..." Mu Xunyun roared, his mouth spewing blood wildly. Light flickered; Luo Tian instantly appeared before Mu Xunyun.

"Buzz..." The golden spear shadow swung down, breaking space and smashing toward Mu Xunyun.

"Crush..." Mu Xunyun had no choice but to raise his blood-red sword in defense.

"One spear... Two spears..." Luo Tian roared continuously, as if venting his rage. He held the spear with both hands and repeatedly smashed toward Mu Xunyun.

"Again that power!" People were surprised, realizing the force Luo Tian had just used was like when he nearly crushed Chen Tianyuan.

"Twice! Twice the physical strength!" Luo Tian muttered in his mind, having understood the power of the Wind-Blowing Hammer Technique.

The Wind-Blowing Hammer Technique was not because Lu Chong had great strength, but rather because speed was equally important.

Previously, when Lu Xinshui used the hammer technique, it was like this—though it seemed one strike, in reality, he had struck countless times. It was just that the speed was too fast for people to see clearly, making it appear as one strike.

Mu Xunyun was a Mid-stage True Immortal, but he had been severely wounded by the Shaking Immortal Eight Styles and the Bow of Shooting the Sun. Now, he had followed in Chen Tianyuan's footsteps, and even worse, as Chen Tianyuan had resisted slightly. He now had no chance to resist at all.

"Crush..." Finally, Mu Xunyun could not endure; his blood-red long sword flew from his hands. His arms met the golden spear.

"Crack..." The arms were instantly shattered by Luo Tian, and the spear shadow struck Mu Xunyun's head. A crack appeared on his skull, and his body fell into Huan Tian Sea.

"Die!" Luo Tian felt it was enough, and he took flight, his golden spear piercing toward Mu Xunyun.

A flash of cold light appeared; the golden spear tip precisely pierced Mu Xunyun's heart. Mu Xunyun had no chance to resist.

"Soulsuck..." Luo Tian's cold voice echoed, and gray souls flew from Mu Xunyun's body. Luo Tian did not let go of Mu Xunyun's flesh either, throwing him into the crowd of Shenglong Sect disciples.

At the same time, gray souls were also sealed with several restrictions by Luo Tian, making Mu Xunyun's soul solid. They were thrown into the crowd of Shenglong Sect disciples.

"Mu Xunyun!" Seeing his enemy, the Shenglong Sect disciples roared with hatred. They saw Mu Xunyun's soul made solid and his pierced flesh, all shouting loudly.

"Do not let him die so easily! Skin him, pull out his sinews, burn his soul, and dismember him!" Shenglong Sect disciples shouted loudly, their eyes filled with ferocity.

"What are you doing!" Mu Xunyun's soul eyes flashed fear, gazing at the ferocious Shenglong Sect disciples. Soon after, his voice was drowned by their madness.

"Guang Hongsheng, are you not going to act?" Luo Tian panted heavily, his gaze turning toward Guang Hongsheng.

"You too!" Guang Hongsheng coldly spoke, addressing those behind him.

"Yes!" Several Mid-stage True Immortals and three Late-stage True Immortals shouted, gazing at Luo Tian before taking flight.

"I know you are forced. I will give you a chance. I'll help you remove the things within your bodies!" Luo Tian spoke solemnly.

"What?" The ten people immediately stopped their movements, their eyes filled with disbelief as they gazed at Luo Tian.

"It's impossible!" The ten people immediately spoke, believing Luo Tian could not truly remove the demon seeds within them.

"Still hesitating? Go kill him!" Guang Hongsheng spoke loudly, his voice filled with authority. A sense of unease arose in his heart at the same time, and waves spread from his hands, causing the ten people's minds to tremble.

"Kill!" The ten people's faces were grim; their lives were in his hands, so they could only charge toward Luo Tian.

"I've given you a chance!" Luo Tian muttered quietly, his voice devoid of any emotion. His hands moved swiftly.

"Come out!" Luo Tian roared, and at that moment, an invisible wave spread from his hands. A strong suction force radiated from his body.

This wave appeared instantly, and the ten True Immortal masters' faces immediately darkened. They felt their cultivation had transformed into demon seeds, trembling violently and flying outward from their bodies.

"Ah..." Within three breaths, the ten people opened their mouths and spat out ten black demon seeds.

"My cultivation!" The ten people immediately lost their strength, falling to the sea of Huan Tian.

"What is that?" The people of Central Three Heavens were all stunned, their eyes filled with disbelief.

"Too terrifying! In an instant, ten people were completely defeated!" People spoke in awe.

"Tian Ge has gone mad!" Ye Liangchen gazed at the ten black demon seeds, his eyes immediately showing anxiety.

The Mind-Devouring Magic was an abomination that even the Immortal world despised. Ye Liangchen knew Luo Tian might have learned it, but he hadn't expected him to use it so soon.

"It's the Mind-Devouring Magic!" People were stunned after a moment, then spoke in fear. After all, none of them were ordinary people.

"How is it possible? Master Mind-Devouring was dead, how could someone still use the Mind-Devouring Magic!" The people of Central Three Heavens were completely panicked, their eyes filled with fear as they gazed at the ten black demon seeds—representing the full cultivation of ten True Immortals.

"Unexpectedly, that sparrow has given you the Mind-Devouring Magic!" Guang Hongsheng's face darkened, then he opened his mouth to suck in the ten demon seeds.

"Return!" Luo Tian extended his hand, but the ten demon seeds did not move; they hovered there, shaking continuously.

"Go!" Guang Hongsheng pointed his finger, and a single fingertip shot out, sending an immense pressure from his hand. A black demon finger rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Boom..." The explosion echoed, the black demon finger like a mountain, carrying overwhelming power and crushing space.

The black demon finger was not only powerful but also fast. In an instant, it reached Luo Tian's front.

The Yin Fish automatically hovered above Luo Tian's head, casting a dark light that protected him.

"Boom..." The explosion echoed, the black demon finger crushing against the black barrier. A thunderous sound rang in people's ears, and the battlefield momentarily stilled.

"Pu..." Luo Tian stood under the barrier, spitting blood, his head ringing and eyes filled with disbelief. He hadn't expected Guang Hongsheng to be so strong, his single fingertip already causing this.

"Luo Tian, fighting with me, you are still too inexperienced!" Guang Hongsheng sneered but did not absorb the demon seeds. Even if he absorbed ten True Immortal's demon seeds, it would take much time to refine them.

Chapter 1992: Destroying World Crimson Lotus ()

"What's happening? This person has the aura of a Mid-stage True Immortal, yet one single finger caused Luo Tian to spit blood?" People were stunned. They had clearly seen that a Mid-stage True Immortal was killed by Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian wiped his lips, the Bow of Shooting the Sun and crackling spear in his hands. His gaze turned toward Guang Hongsheng.

"Just one arrow!" Luo Tian felt his qi, gazing at Guang Hongsheng. He knew he could only fire one arrow, and it was not as before when he had killed a Late-stage True Immortal.

"Crack... Crack..." The Bow of Shooting the Sun's string emitted a crackling sound. Luo Tian's arms bulged with veins, his qi surging endlessly from his dantian. The golden-black elixir was completely emptied.

Even after exhausting all his qi, Luo Tian still hadn't fully drawn the string; he had only pulled it one-third.

"Die!" Luo Tian roared, his voice filled with madness. A golden arrow shot from the black barrier.

"Can he really draw it?" Those who had previously been rebuked by Ye Wudao shuddered involuntarily. If they had attacked Luo Tian then, one of them would have died now.

"It's not right! This arrow is strong but slightly weaker than before. It poses a threat, but it won't kill me! He's already at his limit!" However, as the arrow left the black barrier, people felt something was wrong.

Guang Hongsheng took flight backward, his gaze filled with caution. He raised his hands in a seal, and a dark seal flew from his hands toward the arrow's trajectory.

"Reverse Demon Blade!" Guang Hongsheng roared, now certain that the sparrow would not appear. He waved his hand, and a dark blade emerged from his grasp.

The demon blade pointed forward; in an instant, the golden arrow shattered through the black seal and reached Guang Hongsheng's front.

"Zhi..." Sparks flew, Guang Hongsheng's body continuously retreated but the golden arrow was constantly being eroded.

"Too strong!"

"This person is truly变态 (abnormal). That single arrow could have completely destroyed a Mid-stage True Immortal, but it was blocked by him!" People's eyes showed fear.

"Ultimate True Immortal!" Ye Wudao gazed at Guang Hongsheng, who was continuously retreating. He spoke one word at a time, his eyes filled with caution.

"How is it possible!" Upon hearing Ye Wudao's words, people were stunned. They hadn't expected to see an Ultimate True Immortal.

"An Ultimate True Immortal is so difficult to achieve, yet someone has mastered it!"

"It's no good. Luo Tian, a Late-stage Heavenly Immortal, and now an Ultimate True Immortal!" People's eyes showed astonishment.

"An Ultimate True Immortal, and also the Mind-Devouring Magic!" People thought of a more terrifying possibility. This Guang Hongsheng was definitely a person of note. If given enough time, and if he collected enough demon seeds, he could potentially rush toward the Immortal King realm in the shortest time.

People were stunned as Guang Hongsheng also stopped his body, suddenly halting. His hands trembled but his face bore coldness.

"You have no more strength? Then you can die! Don't worry, I won't truly kill you. I will keep your life and slaughter every disciple of Shenglong Sect before your eyes!" Guang Hongsheng's face twisted with grotesque joy, his body radiating black qi as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"An Ultimate True Immortal, truly powerful!"

"Though I don't want to use it, I have no choice!" Luo Tian's hands moved swiftly. The seven-color mark on his forehead flickered in and out.

As the mark flickered, the ghosts and souls around Luo Tian showed fear, fleeing toward all directions. In an instant, there was nothing left around Luo Tian.

"Chaos-Defying Art!" Guang Hongsheng ignored it, his demon blade continuously slicing. A series of black sword qi flew out.

"Ten... One hundred... One thousand..." In an instant, countless black sword qi filled the heavens and earth. The chaotic sword qi, each over tens of zhang long, swept through, forming a vast storm that rushed toward Luo Tian.

"This kind of qi can only be wielded by an Ultimate True Immortal!" People's faces bore admiration. This martial art alone could drain a Mid-stage True Immortal.

"Crash..." As Guang Hongsheng continuously slashed his sword qi, a sea of seven-color flames also flew from Luo Tian's body, surrounding him.

The scorching heat filled the heavens and earth, a terrifying temperature that seemed to melt the sky. The seven-color flames were unusually eye-catching.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian's hands moved, and an invisible wave spread from his grasp.

The sea of fire roared, the overwhelming flames gradually shrinking. A devastating power was also gathering within the shrinking sea of fire.

In an instant, a seven-color flame lotus凝聚 (coalesced) under the stunned gazes of people. The lotus, only palm-sized, contained an immense power that made the masters of Central Three Heavens feel fear.

"Guang Hongsheng, do you know this thing?" Luo Tian gazed at Guang Hongsheng, his voice playful.

"Crack... Crack..." The seven-color flame lotus hovered on Luo Tian's palm, emitting a clear collision sound. However, the space above the lotus was completely void.

"that sparrow!" Guang Hongsheng's eyes flashed with fear, recalling the terrifying power of the sparrow. He also spat out such a lotus.
