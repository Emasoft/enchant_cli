“Save him!” The others saw the four-colored lightning, brimming with apocalyptic power, their faces instantly paling. The black small sword hovering above them radiated dark light, slicing downward toward the four-colored lightning.

“Sizzling...” Lightning clashed. The black sword severed the four-colored lightning, leaving Qi Hongrui’s soul, weakened to its last breath, like a ghostly remnant.

“Even in this short time, he nearly vanished!” The crowd’s hearts trembled with fear, their faces filled with disbelief.

All halted their attacks, returning to their respective factions. They locked eyes again, but no one from the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans reached Luo Tian’s side to seize the Heavenly Dao Seal.

“Father!” Yao Chen, usually carefree, displayed an unprecedented expression of excitement, his voice trembling.

“Chen’er…” Yao Zun’s weathered face bore a faint smile as he gazed at Yao Chen standing before him, then nodded.

“Unexpectedly, we father and son met again!” Yao Zun sighed softly. That final great battle nearly shattered his soul, but through a fortunate chance, he survived. Yet his memories were sealed, becoming the founder of the Five Elements Sect—Yao Zun. With rebirth in his second life, his memories fully awakened, recalling all from the previous existence.

“Yao Huangtian, an Epoch Lord!” The human clan gasped. Their eyes turned to Yao Chen bowing to Yao Zun, faces filled with awe.

They all knew Yao Chen was a descendant of Yao Huangtian. If he addressed Yao Zun as father, then this frail yet ferociously powerful monkey must be the legendary Sage of Beasts—Yao Huangtian.

“Ah, Yao Huangtian is a monkey!”
“You know nothing. He’s an Ancient Strange Beast—Battle Saint Ape!” They murmured, eyes alight with excitement as they gazed at Yao Zun. A living Epoch Lord—none had ever seen such a thing.

“Damn it!” Seeing Zhang Daotian and others, the royal clan’s faces darkened. Their advantage had shifted; though the black sword was formidable, they needed great effort to control it. Moreover, Qi Hongrui and the second-life strength of the Yin Clan were exhausted.

“Stay put. Watch my disciple’s path to enlightenment!” Zhang Daotian spoke coldly, his voice radiating unshakable authority. His eyes gleamed with icy menace.

“The Heavenly Dao Seal is for all. If we claim it, that’s our fate!” Though the royal clan remained at a disadvantage, they still refused to yield.

“Hmph…” Zhang Daotian sneered. He swung his Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, and a green lightning blade shot forth.

“Puff…” A burst of blood. The second-life strength from the Hun Tian Clan who spoke was instantly turned into a mist of blood.

“Damn, fierce and bold!” Zheng Xin and others gazed at Zhang Daotian’s immediate violence, their faces filled with reverence. Their hearts surged.

“Do you let us speak?” The Ancient Ten Thousand Clans trembled as the Hun Tian Clan’s second-life strength was slain with a single sentence, their hearts shaking.

“Hear this. The Ancient Ten Thousand Clans revere strength as sovereign. Now you are the weak—what right do you have to speak with us?” Zhang Daotian’s robes fluttered. His gaze swept over the crowd, sending an endless chill.

“Buzz…” The black sword radiated dark light above them. Zhang Daotian’s brows furrowed slightly.

“You dare provoke us!” The remaining second-life strengths showed madness on their faces.

“Indeed. If we die, better to fight to the end than let that boy ascend and then be crushed!” The royal clan roared, their voices filled with fury.

“Boom…” As both sides faced off, a thunderous roar erupted beneath the Starry Domain. All turned their eyes to the Starry Domain.

Luo Tian stood like a celestial god, his golden feet crushing the ancient heavenly palace. His steps pressed upon eighteen supreme beings’ heads.

As Luo Tian fought desperately, those eighteen were merely projections—far weaker than true Epoch Lords.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s step crushed one supreme being, which shattered with a thunderous crash.

“Again!” Luo Tian coughed blood. The immense counter-force shook his qi, yet he pressed on with golden feet, each step bringing pressure.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” With every descent, the supreme beings’ projections scattered. They dissolved into divine laws, drifting around the ancient heavenly palace.

“Ferocious Seven Steps of the Divine Beast—Shatter Eternity!” Luo Tian roared. The last supreme being vanished from sight.

“Cough… Cough…” As the final figure disappeared, the ancient heavenly palace collapsed with a thunderous roar. A terrifying storm swept through the Starry Domain, annihilating stars and turning it into a vacuum.

“Show your strength!” Luo Tian roared. He strode forward, his eyes blazing as he gazed at the two crimson eyes in the black sky, as if locking eyes with them.

“Buzz…” The next moment, Luo Tian stood before the Heavenly Dao Seal. His eyes glowed with intense light.

“Don’t let him absorb it!” The Ancient Royal Clan could not bear it. Their faces twisted with madness.

“Kill…” A wave of figures rushed toward Luo Tian, their voices filled with frenzy.

“Don’t learn from your mistakes!” Zhang Daotian sneered. His Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword surged, sweeping toward the royal clan.

At the same time, Yao Zun, Xiang Tianming, and Yin Tianxiong also attacked. Dongbo Xin and Gu Tianshu, recovering their breath, stood at the entrance of the Starry Domain.

“This is what you forced us to do!” The royal clan, seeing six figures, felt a surge of helplessness. They exchanged glances, bit their lips, and moved their hands again.

Chapter 1744: The Burial Coffin of Immortals Appears()

“Force us again!” Zhang Daotian and others spoke strongly. Facing the furious Ancient Royal Clan, their faces showed no emotion. A single strike severed two royal clan prodigies.

“Then die!” The second-life strengths and numerous royal heirs moved their hands. Waves of energy surged from their palms, entering the black sword above them.

“Buzz…” The black sword hummed. A powerful pressure radiated from it, making Zhang Daotian’s group frown slightly.

Though they were strong, even second-life royal clan strengths had no advantage against them. Yet the black sword gave Zhang Daotian’s group a sense of unease. If not for the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, which was supremely yang and had upgraded to a lower-grade divine artifact under Zhang Daotian’s control, it might have been harmed.

As Zhang Daotian’s group was cautious, the black sword moved. A chilling aura erupted from it, making people shiver.

“Did you forget that our elder Zhang blocked it earlier?” Zheng Xin and others sneered, gazing at the black sword. To them, Zhang Daotian and Gu Tianshu could crush anyone.

“Sharp-tongued. You’ll cry soon!” The royal clan’s faces twisted with hatred. They pointed their fingers, and droplets of blood flew from their fingertips toward the black sword. Instantly, it devoured them.

“Buzz…” After consuming the royal clan’s blood, the black sword hummed. Its dark light flared and autonomously slashed into the stars.

Black cracks echoed in the sky. The black sword, which had previously wounded Gu Tianshu, did not attack Zhang Daotian’s group. Instead, it hovered in the stars, carving complex black patterns.

“What is this?” Zhang Daotian furrowed his brows. He gazed at the black patterns, each carving causing a tremor in their hearts.

“Hey, Elder Zhang, Gu Da Ye, Sage Yao—please stop it!” Zheng Xin and others gazed at the black patterns. They felt like a vortex, making them dizzy.

“Good!” Zhang Daotian furrowed his brows. Recognizing the black patterns, he raised his Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword and slashed at them.

“Too late!” The Ancient Royal Clan sneered, watching the black patterns. They laughed.

Before their words finished, waves of energy erupted from the black patterns. The stars split open. A cold aura spread through the fissure.

“Boom… Boom…” Thunderous roars echoed from the fissure. Under Zhang Daotian’s group’s tense gaze, a massive black entity emerged from the crack.

At that moment, the Shrouded Domain’s sky darkened. The already blood-filled domain became even more sinister. An ultimate evil aura spread through the Shrouded Domain.

Black patterns covered the massive entity, as if it could suppress everything. Even the Heavenly Dao would retreat in its presence; rules seemed to change.

“What… what is this thing!” The human clan trembled. Just the aura was enough to shake their minds.

“Those madmen! This is the Burial Coffin of Immortals!” Sun Ke Nian and Diaodezhu roared, their voices trembling.

“The Burial Coffin of Immortals…” Hearing their shouts, everyone’s hearts clenched. They stared at the massive entity that made them powerless.

Upon closer inspection, people finally recognized it as a coffin. They inhaled sharply.

“Damn!” Luo Tian, though in the Starry Domain, looked grim. He knew of the Burial Coffin—though it contained good things, its coffin held a powerful fluctuation.

At that moment, Luo Tian stood before the Heavenly Dao Seal. He saw its soft glow and grabbed it without hesitation.

A gentle aura spread, as if acknowledging him. Luo Tian felt that if he cultivated this seal, he would become one who could suppress the nine heavens and ten earths.

“Cultivate it. The rest is ours!” Zhang Daotian called to Luo Tian, his voice soft.

“Yes! Luo Tian, hurry and cultivate it. Become an Epoch Lord and take us flying!” Diaodezhu and Zheng Xin shouted.

But those like Wang Wang, Jun Wulei, and other Epoch Lords’ heirs wore bitter smiles. The situation was clearly best for Luo Tian to cultivate, even if they wanted to fight, they couldn’t break through Zhang Daotian’s group.

“Good…” Luo Tian nodded. His face showed gratitude. He opened his mouth and swallowed the Heavenly Dao Seal.

“Buzz…” The hum echoed. Waves of energy surged from Luo Tian’s body. His eyes slowly closed, beginning to cultivate the coveted Heavenly Dao Seal.

“Act quickly!” The royal clan watched Luo Tian absorb the seal before them. Their faces were as dark as blood. This time, they directly activated the Burial Coffin to crush Zhang Daotian’s group.

“Die!” The royal clan’s faces were pale. They watched the massive Burial Coffin descend.

“Boom… Boom…” The black ancient coffin collapsed everything, radiating supreme heavenly might. It instantly appeared over Zhang Daotian’s group.

“Creak… Creak…” Before the black coffin arrived, Zhang Daotian’s group’s bodies emitted sounds. Diaodezhu and Zheng Xin were even more miserable, their bodies bending as a desire to submit arose in their hearts.

“Buzz…” Several Epoch Treasures emitted waves, instantly hovering over their heads. They blocked the terrifying pressure.

“What the hell is this thing? Is it really a corpse of an immortal!” Zheng Xin and others roared. Under the protection of several Epoch Treasures, they finally caught their breath and stood upright.

As people marveled, the black Burial Coffin collided with the several Epoch Treasures above their heads.

“Crash…” Each supreme treasure was instantly shattered before the Burial Coffin. Their divine laws dispersed, and a wave of powerful might swept over Zhang Daotian’s group.

“Go away!” Zhang Daotian’s face was solemn. His Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword radiated ten thousand feet of brilliance. A resplendent lightning blade erupted from his hand, slicing toward the black Burial Coffin.

“Crack…” Suddenly, thunderous roars echoed from the black coffin’s base. Everyone was shaken. Lightning power wrapped around the Burial Coffin, as if pulling it back.

“Boom… Boom…” At the same time, Yao Zun also attacked. His golden staff expanded instantly, like a pillar of heaven. He drove it against the Burial Coffin.

“Join me!” Yao Zun called to Gu Tianshu and others. He transformed into a golden light, instantly appearing beneath the black Burial Coffin. He punched forward.

Xiang Tianming, Gu Tianshu, Dongbo Xin and others also surged forth. They became a stream of light. Six people with unyielding momentum appeared beneath the Burial Coffin.

“Boom!” The six people raised their hands to the sky, pressing against the Burial Coffin. Their arms bulged with veins as they blocked the coffin’s path.

As the six people blocked it, the black ancient coffin that had collapsed stars finally stopped. Diaodezhu and others sighed in relief.

“Return!” The six people shouted, exchanged glances, then pushed the Burial Coffin back together.

“You think this is over?” Seeing Zhang Daotian’s group had miraculously blocked the Burial Coffin, the royal clan’s faces darkened. But then several second-life strengths spat blood into the black sword.

“Buzz…” The black blade instantly appeared, slicing the black Burial Coffin. The complex patterns on its surface shattered.

“Open! Burial Coffin of Immortals! Use our clan’s blood to awaken the sleeping immortal!” The royal clan shouted with madness.

“Crack…” Before their words finished, the black coffin’s lid slowly opened. A terrifying evil aura surged out.

“Haha… Finally came out!” A hoarse voice echoed. An abnormal evil aura roared in the stars, making Zhang Daotian’s group grimace.

“Idiot! This Burial Coffin doesn’t hold an immortal!” Zhang Daotian’s face changed. He cursed, then waved his hands. The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword emitted a four-colored lightning barrier, enveloping everyone.

The澎湃 evil aura surged from the Burial Coffin. A blood-red hand凝聚, grabbing Qi Hongrui who was close to the coffin.

Qi Hongrui’s face turned pale. He had already been killed once. Now, captured by the blood-red hand, he couldn’t resist at all. He was pulled into the Burial Coffin.

Chapter 1745: Zhang Daotian’s Physical Body()

“Ah…” A piercing scream echoed from the Burial Coffin. Within moments, Qi Hongrui was silent. The strong life force of a second-life strength vanished completely.

“Dead…” Everyone was shocked. A second-life strength, after countless battles, had finally vanished. It was the first second-life strength to fall in this battle.

“Buzz…” A strong buzz echoed from the Burial Coffin. Blood energy surged, and a thin figure emerged from the blood energy. His eyes were red, like a withered corpse. Yet his aura was immensely powerful, making people tremble.

“He… he looks so familiar!” Next moment, everyone’s faces changed. They gazed at the thin old man. Though he was somewhat distorted, they still recognized his face. Their eyes turned to Zhang Daotian, who radiated immense aura.

“Seems…” Everyone’s eyes were filled with disbelief. They gazed at the thin old man and Zhang Daotian. Their faces had a few similarities. If the thin old man were plump, he would resemble Zhang Daotian by eight parts.

“Haha… Is this my body?” The thin old man smiled. He gazed at Zhang Daotian, his smile revealing white teeth. His red eyes stared at Zhang Daotian.

“Ah! I see now!” Zhang Daotian, hearing the thin old man’s words, wore a solemn expression. He locked eyes with the thin old man. An invisible wave formed between them.

“This was my physical body!” Zhang Daotian spoke to Gu Tianshu and others. His voice carried icy intent.

“Physical body…” Hearing Zhang Daotian’s words, everyone gasped. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.

“More accurately, this body belongs to me. The soul within it was self-generated. Thus, he has become another existence!” Zhang Daotian saw the confusion in their eyes.

That black sword had long been familiar to Zhang Daotian. He suspected the Burial Coffin’s presence might have a connection with himself. Now, after the royal clan opened it and revealed this thin old man, Zhang Daotian immediately recognized him as his previous physical body.

Long ago, Zhang Daotian had accidentally entered the Nine Realms. He eventually abandoned his physical body and reincarnated in the Immortal Ancient Continent. His physical body had been lost somewhere.

Now, with his second-life awakening, his memories returned. Naturally, he recognized this physical body as his own. Yet he hadn’t expected it to be in the Burial Coffin.

“Coincidence!” The physical body of Zhang Daotian spoke softly. He gazed at Zhang Daotian, his eyes filled with ferocity.

“Where is the Epoch Book?” As a derivative of Zhang Daotian’s physical body, it naturally knew all about his past. It could be said that most of the items in the Burial Coffin were Zhang Daotian’s belongings. However, they had ultimately been assimilated by this self-generated evil spirit.

“Unexpectedly, my body is so weak! It seems you truly deserve to die. I’ll devour you!” Before Zhang Daotian could speak, the evil spirit’s face showed greed. It gazed at Zhang Daotian.

Hearing their conversation, people trembled. Their gazes toward Zhang Daotian changed. If a person’s physical body could be so formidable after death, what must his strength have been before?

“Freakish! He wasn’t an immortal before!” Everyone’s faces showed shock. They guessed Zhang Daotian’s past strength and identity.

“Buzz…” As people marveled, waves spread beneath the stars. A towering aura came from the Starry Domain, making people’s faces grim.

“It’s Luo Tian. The Heavenly Dao Seal is nearly cultivated!” A few royal heirs’ faces darkened. They felt Luo Tian’s aura growing stronger, as if breaking the limits of the Nine Realms. This aura was familiar to them—exactly like their fathers’.

“Oh? It’s a good fortune. There’s still a Heavenly Dao Seal waiting for me to cultivate!” The physical body of Zhang Daotian smiled excitedly. He gazed at Luo Tian sitting in meditation.

“Just you?” Zhang Daotian’s face was cold. He gazed at his physical body, though he spoke dismissively, his heart was solemn. His grip on the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword tightened.

“Just me!” The evil spirit sneered, then moved. It transformed into a red light and vanished instantly.

“Be careful. My past strength was an Epoch Lord. Even if it has declined somewhat, this thing’s strength is unfathomable. Though its power has dropped significantly, an Epoch Lord would find it hard to defeat!” Zhang Daotian spoke to those around him.

“I’ll try to restrain it. You attack and kill it!” Zhang Daotian quickly voiced his plan.

“Boom…” However, before Zhang Daotian’s group moved, the evil spirit attacked. Its target was not Zhang Daotian’s group but the Ancient Royal Clan it had released.

“Buzz…” A blood-red hand formed in the evil spirit’s hands. It rushed toward the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans.

“Why!” The Ancient Ten Thousand Clans cried out, their voices filled with despair. They were instantly killed by the evil spirit.

Blood dyed the stars. The royal clan was furious, gazing at the evil spirit. They hadn’t expected something that radiated overwhelming evil and embodied all hatred to be released.

“Idiots, have you thought about where it was nurtured? A place of extremes—Lei Hai Marsh, a place of ultimate yang that birthed this ultimate evil. Would it return your kindness?” Seeing the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans lose many, Diaodezhu and others roared.

“Don’t worry. No one will escape!” The evil spirit opened its mouth, sucking in a flood of blood. Its eyes gleamed with ecstasy.

“Blood tastes so good!” The evil spirit muttered, licking its crimson lips. After absorbing blood, it seemed plumper. It gazed at others before turning its eyes to Zhang Daotian’s group.

“I’ll kill you next!” The evil spirit spoke to the royal clan.

“Damn it!” Hearing the evil spirit’s words, the royal clan regretted deeply. They hadn’t expected opening the Burial Coffin would release such a thing—unfeeling, bloodthirsty, and indifferent to their lives.

“Die!” The evil spirit extended its hand. Blood surged. A red hand erupted, rushing toward Zhang Daotian’s group at the front.

Divine power was vast. Evil aura merged with divine energy. The massive hand shattered stars, instantly descending upon Zhang Daotian’s group. The immense pressure made their faces grim.

This hand seemed ordinary, but it was no less intense than the Burial Coffin’s previous pressure. Any one of them would find it extremely challenging.

“This is the aura of an Epoch Lord!” Seeing the blood-red hand, Duhongxi and others’ faces turned shocked. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.

“An Epoch Lord? That’s even more terrifying than an Epoch Lord!” Hearing Duhongxi and others’ words, people trembled.

“Absolutely no mistake. This strength is comparable to an Epoch Lord. I once saw an Epoch Lord shatter a mountain in the Immortal Realm. Remember, the things of the Immortal Realm are long nurtured by divine energy and extremely strong. An Epoch Lord would find it impossible to shatter!” Mayuxin’s face showed fear, gazing at the evil spirit with red eyes. He spoke in disbelief.

“Sigh…” A sound of inhaling cold air echoed. People were awestruck by the evil spirit’s power while feeling despair.

An Epoch Lord could crush them all. Now, an even stronger Epoch Lord had appeared—this was beyond their ability to resist.

“Beast! Do you know whose physical body this is!” Zhang Daotian’s face was solemn. He swung his Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, slicing his wrist. Blood spilled, forming strange symbols on his body.

“Return!” Zhang Daotian extended his hand. Invisible waves flew from it, wrapping around his former physical body. Waves of sealing power spread through the invisible waves.

“Want to seal me? You dream too much!” The evil spirit’s eyes flashed red. It felt its entire body was controlled by an unknown force, as if to be sealed.

“Kill…” Yao Zun swung his golden staff. He had once been a supreme being. Though his current strength wasn’t at its peak, his attack was still terrifying. The golden staff swung, colliding with the blood-red hand.

Others also attacked, using powerful martial arts to strike at the blood-red hand.

“Boom… Boom…” The blood-red hand shattered in the stars. Meanwhile, Gu Tianshu and Yao Zun’s bodies fell repeatedly, their mouths bleeding.

“Die!” The evil spirit snarled. It felt an unknown force pulling it, most of its power now uncontrollable.

“Hurry! I’ve restrained most of his strength. You must finish him quickly. I can’t hold on long!” Zhang Daotian’s face was drenched in cold sweat. After speaking, he stopped talking and fought the evil spirit another way.

Chapter 1746: Open Eyes()

“Kill…” Hearing Zhang Daotian’s words, Gu Tianshu and others moved immediately. They rushed toward the still formidable evil spirit. They knew this was their only chance to kill it. If they missed, letting the evil spirit recover would make defeating it impossible.

With thunderous roars, they unleashed all their techniques. Gu Tianshu’s hands moved swiftly. A golden divine furnace surged toward the evil spirit.

Yao Zun swung his golden staff, carrying supreme heavenly might. It was violently powerful, shattering stars. The golden staff’s image became a stream of light.

Xiang Tianming transformed into a Kunpeng. He soared upward, spitting out a gray mist. It evolved into boundless divine laws, rushing toward the evil spirit.

Yin Tianxiong held a green whisk. He continuously waved it, sending gentle winds from the whisk. Though seemingly soft, those gentle winds contained terrifying power—capable of destroying everything.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” Thunderous roars echoed. Five powerful martial arts—even a near-Epoch Lord or an Epoch Lord would pay a price to block them. Five people represented five ultimate forces.

Yao Zun’s violence, Gu Tianshu’s invincibility, Dongbo Xin’s strength, Yin Tianxiong’s mystery, and Xiang Tianming’s grandeur.

The stars changed color. Everyone’s eyes were filled with awe, watching the five figures radiating supreme might and their five martial arts capable of destroying everything.

“Same second-life, yet the gap is so big?” Fu Cangshan and others’ eyes showed bitterness. They gazed at Gu Tianshu’s group, unable to find an answer.

The Ancient Royal Clan was now in a desperate situation. They had thought their second-life strengths would easily destroy the human clan. But after countless battles, they suffered heavy losses. Their top strength was far behind the human clan.

“Think you can match me?” The evil spirit roared. It radiated a surge of blood energy, instantly enveloping Yao Zun and others in a sea of blood. The thick blood mist obscured their vision.

“Open the world!” Everyone’s eyes were filled with awe. They watched the evil spirit and Gu Tianshu’s group enveloped in a blood world, unable to see their battle. But they could hear the thunderous roars.

“Danger! This world was created by that beast. Its rules favor him!” Duhongxi and others spoke in disbelief. Their eyes were much higher than the Nine Realms’ people, so they knew how powerful the evil spirit’s methods were.

“We still have a chance!” A royal clan prodigy’s face showed madness. He watched the world created by the evil spirit. At this moment, the human clan’s strongest were entangled with the evil spirit. The remaining people had no second-life strengths, but they still had several second-life strengths—this was their best chance to seize the Heavenly Dao Seal.

“Good opportunity! Seize Luo Tian, that little bastard. We still have a chance to ascend!” The royal clan went mad. They knew this was their last opportunity.

“Despicable!” The human clan’s faces were grim, but they cursed and blocked the royal clan’s path.

“Move aside!” The second-life strength of the Golden Crow Clan spat out a fire lotus, sweeping toward the human clan.

“This is our last chance. We’ll risk everything to clear the path for you!” Other second-life strengths, except Fu Cangshan and Man Zhan, remained silent. They exchanged glances.

Though the royal clan still had a chance, Zhang Daotian and Yao Zun’s group had shocked them too much. They felt even if they could ascend, they wouldn’t be able to match the combined strength of these people. After all, this evil spirit was a being beyond the Epoch Lord level—though not as strong as they called an immortal, it wasn’t much different.

“Man Zhan, Fu Cangshan, what are you two staring at? Join us and fight to clear the path. Seize the Heavenly Dao Seal!” Other clan second-life strengths called to the two who hadn’t acted.

“Enough. Our tribe withdraws from invading the Nine Realms!” Man Zhan shouted, causing the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans to pause. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.

“We also withdraw!” Fu Cangshan sighed deeply, his voice carrying exhaustion.

“I agree with coexistence among the Ten Thousand Clans, including humans!” Fu Cangshan gazed at the exhausted Ancient Ten Thousand Clans.

“What did you say?” Hearing their words, other clan members’ faces darkened. They gazed at Fu Cangshan and Man Zhan, eyes filled with endless hatred.

“This war has killed so many. The Nine Realms, including humans, have been dying every day. Look at your clan members—how many remain! We’ve fought and killed for what?”

“Humans, we can’t destroy you. Since ancient times, humans have existed and continued until now. There must be a reason!”

“It’s time to end this!” Man Zhan and Fu Cangshan spoke, their voices carrying exhaustion. They took a step back.

Man Zhan and Fu Cangshan’s words were like thunder in the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans’ ears. The clans erupted into a storm.

“We also agree to coexistence among the Ten Thousand Clans!” Two major clans spoke. The weaker clans followed suit.

The royal clan was strong, but these smaller clans relied on their protection. They risked being wiped out. This war had shown the cruelty of battle. In just these days, many races had been completely destroyed. Now, the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans were no longer as powerful.

“Traitors!” Other clan members glared at Fu Cangshan and Man Zhan. Their withdrawal took away a third of the Ten Thousand Clans’ strength.

“Stop this. Fighting endlessly won’t end!” Fu Cangshan and Man Zhan spoke again, with many more people declaring their withdrawal.

“You two clans are close to humans. But we have no choice. We don’t believe that boy’s ascension will spare us!” The second-life strength of the Golden Crow Clan spoke softly, his eyes filled with determination.

“Humans have always wanted coexistence among the Ten Thousand Clans. But you’ve always been aggressive, looking down on us as insects and trying to destroy us. We had no choice but to resist!” Jiang Nanxuan stepped forward, speaking loudly.

“I am here and can represent Luo Tian. If we stop fighting, past grievances will be forgotten. Let’s unite to kill this evil spirit and restore peace to the Nine Realms!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke with solemnity.

“You are what? You dare represent the entire human clan!” Before Jiang Nanxuan finished speaking, a cold voice rose behind him. A blood-red sword transformed into a streak of blood, rushing toward Jiang Nanxuan.

“Puff…” The attack was too sudden. No one expected someone to strike at this moment. Everyone was slightly stunned.

The sword stained with blood pierced Jiang Nanxuan’s shoulder. A youth in a blood robe appeared behind him.
