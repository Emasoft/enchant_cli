“Ha ha, this is the essence of our Holy Son’s three supreme arts! Corrupting Heaven and Earth, capable of eroding everything!” Two subordinates at the middle stage of Sainthood stood behind the monster, their faces filled with mockery as they gazed at Gu Lei and his companions.

“Smack…” Before the two subordinates could finish speaking, the monster turned around and slapped one of them across the face.

“Fool! You can’t even deal with a couple of Saint-beginners! What use are you two?” The monster spoke coldly, grabbing the two and shoving them into the revolting saliva.

“Holy Son, mercy!” The two subordinates screamed in agony after coming into contact with the saliva, but before they could finish their cries, they vanished into the saliva, rising a thick smoke. They had no chance of regenerating even a single drop of blood.

“Monsters are monsters; their methods are so peculiar. Today I truly gained new insight!” Zheng Xin couldn’t help but curse, his eyes filled with fear as he gazed at the monster.

“Look! The shield of the Era has also been corroded!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke solemnly, his face changing as he watched the weakening light shield.

“What in the world is this thing! Luo Tian, if you don’t save us, we’ll die here!” Gu Lei and his companions cried out beneath the Era Bell and Spirit Transport Vessel, looking around desperately but failing to find Luo Tian.

Sun Mengru stood there, her pale face turning grim as she saw the river-like stench of saliva spreading toward her.

“Heavenly Mechanism Map!” She whispered, attempting to open the map, but her divine power was uncontrollable and unresponsive.

“Ha ha, little one, you wanted to protect this goddess of the gods, didn’t you? I’ll kill her first. Your speed is indeed fast, but your friends are all going to die!” The monster shouted mockingly.

“Beast! You even kill your own kind, showing you’ve completely lost humanity. You’re not even as good as an animal!” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed through the void, appearing before Sun Mengru. He wrapped her in his arms while golden arrow feathers shot from his hands, piercing through the stars.

The golden arrow feathers split the repulsive river in two, instantly reaching the monster’s front and piercing into its formidable flesh.

“Boom…” A large amount of blood and meat rained down from the stars, the monster’s eyes filled with shock. At the same time, a ghost-like figure appeared before it, and violent Dao power surged toward the monster. Golden fists rained down like raindrops, one after another, striking the monster’s body.

“Ah…” The monster was a Saint-end stage powerhouse. At the moment of crisis, it immediately launched a nimble counterattack. Its newly grown arms swung wildly, colliding repeatedly with the fists imbued with Dao power.

Luo Tian placed Sun Mengru on his back beneath the endless stars, continuously launching the Dao Sealing Fist against the monster. He fought as if mad, determined to eradicate this beast completely; its existence was a祸害 (disaster) for the entire Nine Realms.

Although Luo Tian had been shocked by the monster’s Saint-end strength, after a long battle with it, he realized that this beast was not truly cultivated through years of effort. Its cultivation seemed to have been enhanced by pills or other methods, likely connected with the Twin Cultivation method of the Harmonious Sect.

Though its strength was formidable, it lacked endurance. As Luo Tian continued attacking, the repulsive river that had been split by the Heaven-Devouring Bow gradually weakened. Moreover, with their continuous collisions, Luo Tian felt the monster’s divine power was struggling to hold on. Even a regular Saint-end powerhouse would be stronger than this beast.

“Ha ha, it’s just a beast relying on strange attack methods. Now I see you’re not so great after all! I even initially respected you a bit and was cautious!” Luo Tian’s boldness grew stronger with each battle. Every punch of the Dao Sealing Fist sent the monster retreating several miles.

Faced with Luo Tian’s mockery, the monster’s face turned grim. Its body emitted a series of cracking sounds; if it weren’t for its extremely strong flesh, even one or two punches from Luo Tian would have been unbearable.

Luo Tian’s guess was correct. The monster had achieved its current cultivation through the Twin Cultivation method of the Harmonious Sect—male disciples absorbing yin to strengthen themselves, female disciples absorbing yang. Then, male and female disciples within the sect further cultivated together, their strength increasing at a terrifying rate.

However, this method had a major drawback: its cultivation was not solid. Compared to peers of the same level, Harmonious Sect disciples were often weaker. This beast was an exception; its flesh was powerful, and it had inherited something unknown. Its attack methods were also strange, making most peers fall to its hands.

But the beast was unfortunate; it had encountered Luo Tian, an extraordinary prodigy. Not only that, but if Sun Mengru hadn’t been poisoned, this beast wouldn’t have acted so boldly. Even someone like Feng Jiutian at the Saint-middle stage would have had to step aside.

“Haha, I think this thing is actually poison!” Gu Lei’s eyes gleamed as he watched the saliva, which had weakened but still enveloped the Era Bell and Spirit Transport Vessel.

“Luo Tian, lend me your Emerald Jade Flame!” Gu Lei rubbed his hands together, forgetting the revolting nature of the poison, his eyes glowing with excitement as he rubbed them.

“Damn it, your taste is really heavy!” Zheng Xin and Wan Lingkong looked at Gu Lei in disbelief, while Jiang Nanxuan furrowed his brows, observing the battle outside with a contemplative expression.

“We are all too weak! This time Luo Tian could protect us, but what about next time?” Jiang Nanxuan shook his head gently.

“Yes, but having Luo Tian is enough. I still prefer studying formations; my cultivation is for creating stronger formations!” Wan Lingkong shook his head, expressing his intention.

“That’s right, it makes sense. But what if Luo Tian can’t continue cultivating? Who will we rely on?” Jiang Nanxuan’s face showed a deep worry, yet his eyes also held a determined glint.

Although Jiang Nanxuan’s cultivation wasn’t high, none of the group had ever underestimated him. Even Luo Tian regarded him as someone whose future achievements would not be inferior to his own, a slow-burning talent.

Luo Tian flicked his finger, and the emerald green flame flew into the Era Bell, reaching Gu Lei before continuing to battle with the monster.

Sun Mengru clung to Luo Tian’s back, a slight smile on her face. For some reason, Luo Tian gave her an unfamiliar sense of safety and a strange attachment.

“Maybe my past life really was as he said,” Sun Mengru sighed inwardly, suddenly longing for Luo Tian to complete the Reincarnation Pill quickly.

“Ah…” A scream echoed out as Luo Tian, like a legendary warrior, shattered the monster’s flesh with one punch. Dao power continuously refined the slowly gathering blood and meat.

Luo Tian wiped his arms, covered in the stinking flesh, gazing at the monster emitting thick white smoke.

“Luo Tian… I’ll die! I won’t let you go!” The monster’s shadow roared, charging at Luo Tian with a furious roar.

The gray soul expanded rapidly under Luo Tian’s gaze, breaking free from the Dao chains and rushing toward him with a roar.

“Be careful!” Sun Mengru, on Luo Tian’s back, saw the gray soul and her face turned pale with worry.

“Don’t worry. He’s not strong enough to harm me!” Luo Tian’s hands formed a seal, and the golden print of Soul-Grasping Seal fell from the sky. This was a rarely used martial art, a spiritual technique that strongly suppressed souls.

“Boom…” The print fell like a meteor, striking the soul just before it reached Luo Tian.

“Puk…” But then an unexpected event occurred. Just as the print was about to touch Luo Tian, the gray soul spat out a cloud of gray mist, appearing before Luo Tian.

Its speed was incredible; even Luo Tian barely reacted in time. The gray mist沾染 (stained) his body.

“Ha ha, let’s die together!” With a pig-like roar, the monster’s soul was crushed by the Soul-Grasping Seal and vanished from sight.

“Hmm?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly. His body didn’t feel any discomfort, and the gray mist slowly coalesced into a strange symbol on his arm.

“What is this?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, confusion in his eyes. He had clearly heard the monster’s roar before, but now he felt no reaction at all. This made a strange feeling arise in his heart.

“You can put me down now!” Sun Mengru, on Luo Tian’s back, blushed slightly and spoke to him.

“Hmm!” Luo Tian smiled slightly. Though he wanted to stay like this, he released the divine power that had restrained Sun Mengru. After all, the one who had been waiting by the wall for a red apricot was already dead and no longer a threat.

Luo Tian turned around, gazing at Sun Mengru with gentle eyes. Then his brows furrowed again; he could sense that the poison in Sun Mengru’s body was unusual. It could only be suppressed, and even with Emerald Jade Flame, it would be impossible to eliminate.

“How are you?” Sun Mengru saw the strange symbol on Luo Tian’s arm and furrowed her brows, obviously having heard the monster’s roar before death.

“暂时 no discomfort. Don’t worry, I’m very lucky!” Luo Tian gently took Sun Mengru’s arm and placed his hand on her wrist, sending spiritual awareness into her body again.

“Don’t waste your effort. This poison isn’t ordinary; it flew out of the Divine Beast Ancient Cave. Among our group, only I managed to escape using the Heavenly Mechanism Map!” Sun Mengru shook her head gently, a slight blush on her face as she pulled her hand from Luo Tian’s.

“Divine Beast Ancient Cave? Why did you go there? It's one of the Nine Absolute Dangers!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed confusion. He couldn’t understand why a goddess of the Divine Clan would be sent to the Divine Beast Ancient Cave.

“Grandpa Sun He Feng was injured. I went there to take a chance!” Sun Mengru shook her head gently, her eyes filled with sorrow.

Upon hearing Sun Mengru’s words, Luo Tian fell silent. He thought of the old man who had blocked him at the inn in the Demon Region. Luo Tian could sense that Sun Mengru relied on this old man, even treating him as family.

“Need anything? What can I do for you?” Luo Tian smiled gently, asking Sun Mengru and not questioning why Grandpa Sun He Feng was injured, even though he was a Divine Clan member.

“Sacred medicine. Medicine that can prolong life and heal wounds!” Sun Mengru’s face showed a bitter smile. Sacred medicine was so hard to find. When she returned to the Divine Clan, the sacred medicine given by Master Qi Lingxiao of the Ancient Times Palace had been handed over to the Divine Clan. After all, the old Divine King needed sacred medicine to prolong his life.

Sun Mengru knew Luo Tian had sacred medicine, but it was too precious—equivalent to another life. Moreover, she had heard that Luo Tian relied on sacred medicine to endlessly draw the Heaven-Devouring Bow.

The Divine Clan had also sought sacred medicine for her, but as a goddess of the Divine Clan, she was merely a decoration in the eyes of the core leaders. Everyone knew what would happen to the Divine Clan goddess, so they wouldn’t waste precious sacred medicine on her. Moreover, Sun He Feng’s injury was closely related to Sun Mengru; it was the Divine King himself who had caused this.

Sun Mengru could only place her hopes in the Divine Beast Ancient Cave. She hadn’t managed to collect sacred medicine but had instead been poisoned, almost captured by that repulsive monster.

“Woo…” A green glow illuminated the entire starry sky, filling it with powerful vitality. The wobbly herbs emitted a gentle aura and appeared in people’s sight.

“Take it. Is one enough?” Luo Tian spoke softly, his eyes filled with affection as he handed the sacred medicine to Sun Mengru and asked if it was enough, worrying it might not be sufficient. He also gave her the remaining herb.

Chapter 1054: Toxify Pearl

Under the starry sky, Luo Tian handed two sacred herbs to Sun Mengru, who looked excited. She clutched the herb that was worth a life.

“Is it not enough? If not, I’ll think of another way!” Luo Tian looked at Sun Mengru’s silence and furrowed his brows, taking out the Palace Seal.

“Enough! Enough! One is enough! This is too expensive!” Sun Mengru saw Luo Tian take out the Palace Seal. She knew he was about to teleport back to the Ancient Times Palace, as the artifact spirit had said Luo Tian could return three times. She was present at that time.

But Sun Mengru didn’t know Luo Tian had become the master of the Palace. She thought he would still risk returning to the Ancient Times Palace, as the artifact spirit’s power had exceeded her understanding.

After saying this, Sun Mengru handed one herb back to Luo Tian. But Luo Tian gently shook his head. He could sense that Sun Mengru had encountered some difficulties in the Divine Clan, otherwise she wouldn’t have risked going to the Divine Beast Ancient Cave.

“Maybe you…”, Luo Tian wanted to ask Sun Mengru to go to the Four Sacred Star Domains, but before he could finish his sentence, he shook his head. Not only was Sun He Feng still in danger within the Divine Clan, but also, despite being raised by the Divine Clan, Sun Mengru would never leave it. Some things wouldn’t change even after reincarnation—like stubbornness.

Back then, Chen Yunting had made Luo Tian hate her but never told him the truth. That was enough to show her stubbornness.

“Not needed! One is enough! Take it back!” Sun Mengru shook her head, pushing the herb back into Luo Tian’s hands.

“Take it. Remember, no matter when you need it, if I have it, I’ll give it to you. Not just two sacred herbs, but even my life is yours!” Luo Tian gazed at Sun Mengru with deep affection and forcefully pushed the herb into her hands.

Seeing Luo Tian’s deep gaze, Sun Mengru was stunned. Her heart, frozen for years, had stirred slightly. She stood there in silence, still hearing Luo Tian’s words.

At that moment, Sun Mengru suddenly thought of her treatment in the Divine Clan. Although Luo Tian and she were strangers, to be precise, they were enemies of the Divine Clan, he had saved her life multiple times. They met twice: first, he took the heavenly thunder for her; second, he gave her a world-shattering sacred herb.

Although Luo Tian always said it was him who owed her, Sun Mengru believed that most people would not seek her out if they were in Luo Tian’s situation. To do this much, besides parents, no one else could.

“Thank you!” Sun Mengru spoke softly. Her voice was small but clear enough for Luo Tian to catch it, making his brows furrow slightly.

“I’ve told you before, don’t say ‘thank you’ to me!” Luo Tian shook his head gently.

“Tell me how you got poisoned!” Luo Tian furrowed his brows again, returning the topic to the bug in Sun Mengru’s dantian. After all, relying on medicine alone wasn’t a solution.

“Honestly, I don’t know how I got poisoned! But it was definitely in the Divine Beast Ancient Cave!” Sun Mengru showed a bitter smile, shaking her head. She had no idea how she got poisoned and felt uncomfortable.

“I feel this little bug isn’t poison. It just devours divine power too fast!” Luo Tian shook his head, feeling this little bug was more like a venom.

“Tell me what happened. Maybe there are clues!” Luo Tian continued, determined to find every detail concerning Sun Mengru.

“Recently, the Divine Beast Ancient Cave emitted radiant light, as if a precious treasure had emerged. Many sects entered the cave to seek their fortune. I was also one of them. But as soon as we stepped into the cave, two extreme forces formed a terrifying storm that wiped out everyone inside. I only escaped because of the Heavenly Mechanism Map. When I felt no danger, I stepped out of the map and found myself outside the cave, but there was this black bug in my dantian!” Sun Mengru shook her head without providing any valuable clues.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows deeper. According to Sun Mengru’s account, without a pseudo-era treasure, no one could survive the Divine Beast Ancient Cave.

“What is this thing?” Luo Tian felt a bit frustrated, recalling ancient texts but not finding any information about this little bug.

“Damn it! Gu Lei, your taste is really heavy!” As Luo Tian was deep in thought, Zheng Xin’s shouts made him snap out of it. He turned to look at Gu Lei and Zheng Xin, but then both Luo Tian and Sun Mengru’s mouths twitched.

In their view, the Emerald Jade Flame was being driven by Gu Lei. The flame wrapped a strange pearl, emitting a repulsive odor.

“Damn it! What are you doing, Gu Lei!” Luo Tian flew over to Gu Lei and slapped his head with a big hand.

A wave of discontent passed through Luo Tian’s mind. The Emerald Jade Flame seemed to be upset, constantly jumping.

“Damn it! You’re using the Emerald Jade Flame to refine that monster’s saliva!” Luo Tian couldn’t help but curse. The thought of the Emerald Jade Flame returning to his body made him shudder.

“Stop it! Quick, don’t stop!” Luo Tian raised his hand again and swung at Gu Lei’s head.

“Don’t, brother-in-law! You’re my real brother-in-law. It’s almost done. Don’t take it back. I promise you won’t regret it. If I do, I’ll eat ten catties of aphrodisiacs!” Gu Lei looked at Luo Tian with a begging expression, his eyes filled with excitement.

Sun Mengru smiled, watching Luo Tian and his group. Her eyes showed envy; she could feel that these people were those who would entrust their lives to each other.

“Is this what friendship is?” Sun Mengru smiled softly, whispering. However, when she heard Gu Lei call him “brother-in-law,” her face suddenly turned pale. Her already pale complexion grew even paler, and she showed a hint of bitterness.

“Ah, he has a wife!” Sun Mengru’s eyes were slightly moist. Her chest felt tight, but she forced herself to suppress the emotion and smiled awkwardly. She walked toward Luo Tian’s group, curious about what Gu Lei was up to.

“Don’t worry. You’ll know soon!” Gu Lei looked excited, even after being slapped by Luo Tian, his eyes never left the green flame-processed pearl.

“Almost there! Almost there!” As time passed, Gu Lei finally moved after everyone’s anticipation. His eyes showed determination as his hands continuously changed, emitting purple qi that was打入 (inserted) into the green pearl, now the size of a human head.

Purple divine power emerged from Gu Lei’s hands, forming into long dragons of purple seals and being inserted into the pearl.

“Woo…” After Gu Lei’s purple divine power was inserted, the pearl emitted a series of buzzing sounds. Surprisingly, the extremely repulsive stench decreased after Gu Lei’s purple divine power was inserted.

“What is this?” Zheng Xin looked puzzled. They all knew Gu Lei had a poison-type body, making him the top expert in poisons.

“Haha, wait and see!” Gu Lei worked harder, his divine power seemingly without cost. He even consumed several pills to replenish it.

After another half day, the pearl had shrunk significantly. The repulsive odor decreased gradually, and the pearl became transparent with a faint fragrance in the starry sky.

“What’s going on? This is so boring!” Zheng Xin and Wan Lingkong showed impatience, but Gu Lei ignored their words. His eyes were filled with madness.

Finally, a shocking fragrance entered everyone’s noses. Even Luo Tian couldn’t help but want to smell it more.

“Stop!” Gu Lei’s voice trembled as he shouted, his hands forming countless purple dragons that flew into the pearl now the size of a fingernail and almost transparent.

“Ha ha! Toxify Pearl! It’s done! From now on, no one can harm us with poison!” Gu Lei laughed loudly, grabbing the almost transparent pearl that emitted a faint aura. His eyes were filled with excitement.

Luo Tian and the others looked at Gu Lei’s pearl, then suddenly realized something, their eyes filled with disbelief.

But as they focused on Gu Lei’s pearl, Sun Mengru’s face suddenly turned pale and she spat out a mouthful of blood.

At the same time, a black line shot toward Gu Lei’s hand. The small black bug, unknown where it came from, had a mouth large enough to attach itself to the Toxify Pearl and began to gnaw it. In a moment, it devoured Gu Lei’s painstakingly refined Toxify Pearl completely.

Chapter 1055: Soul-Eating Silkworm

Under the starry sky, Gu Lei’s face turned grim as he watched his Toxify Pearl vanish instantly. His eyes showed disbelief.

“Where is the Toxify Pearl?” Zheng Xin and Wan Lingkong couldn’t believe their eyes, staring at Gu Lei’s palm. The Toxify Pearl had disappeared too quickly for them to react.

Jiang Nanxuan furrowed his brows slightly. He had only seen a black line flash by and hadn’t seen what it was.

“Damn it! Who dares to steal from me!” Gu Lei roared, his voice loud enough to echo across the starry sky. His anger was evident.

“Hey, Gu Lei, you’re mourning! No one could steal from you without a sound. That person must be a high-level master!” Zheng Xin showed a sigh of regret.

The Toxify Pearl was the antidote to all poisons. No matter what poison it encountered, it would be destroyed. With the Toxify Pearl, encountering a poison cultivator or a poisonous region was absolutely controlled. How could Gu Lei not be heartbroken?

“After working hard for half a day and nearly dying, it was stolen by someone. If you were in my place, could you not be angry?” Gu Lei spoke loudly, his voice filled with resentment.

Luo Tian and Sun Mengru looked at each other in disbelief. Although they were shocked that Gu Lei had refined the Toxify Pearl from the monster’s saliva, they were even more shocked by the small bug that devoured the Toxify Pearl instantly.

Among the group, only Luo Tian and Sun Mengru saw the bug attaching to the Toxify Pearl. In an instant, it devoured the pearl completely.

“Don’t worry!” Luo Tian smiled slightly. After all, this bug was in Sun Mengru’s body and now had emerged, which was a great blessing.

Gu Lei refined the Toxify Pearl. Luo Tian would naturally let Sun Mengru try to use it to remove the bug in her dantian. However, that would be too disgusting.

The Toxify Pearl was now seemingly ordinary, but Luo Tian knew it was made from the monster’s saliva. If Sun Mengru tried to use it, it would be too disgusting. He believed she wouldn’t agree.

Now was better; the bug had come out on its own, which also relieved Luo Tian’s worry. It was a good thing.

“Don’t be in a hurry!” Gu Lei muttered, watching Luo Tian’s happy expression.

But before Gu Lei could finish his sentence, Luo Tian and the others saw something on Gu Lei’s head, their eyes filled with surprise.

“Woo…” A ripple spread out. Starlight flickered on Gu Lei’s head, like a firefly.

“It’s that bug!” Luo Tian’s eyes brightened. He could sense this bug might be no ordinary creature. He pulled Sun Mengru behind him, fearing any mishap. After all, it was Sun Mengru who had brought it out of the Divine Beast Ancient Cave.

As Luo Tian’s gaze fell, others also looked at the bug, their eyes filled with confusion.

“What is this thing? Why can I sense the scent of Toxify Pearl on it!” Gu Lei’s face turned grim. He looked at the bug’s head, which was completely disproportionate to its belly, and realization dawned on him.

“Ah! It’s you, little thing!” Gu Lei gritted his teeth. Although he was angry at the bug, his eyes showed awe.

The Toxify Pearl was extremely hard. Gu Lei knew that. But this bug hadn’t simply swallowed it; it had gnawed it. After all, he had only felt a slight movement before and hadn’t paid much attention. To gnaw the Toxify Pearl, Gu Lei couldn’t imagine anything this bug couldn’t eat.

“Crack…” A series of cracking sounds echoed in people’s ears, as if shedding skin. A fleshy little creature, resembling a silkworm, appeared in people’s sight.

The bug was no longer black but crystalline and jade-like. Compared to before, it was completely different. This bug looked adorable, its plump body making Luo Tian unable to imagine it was the one that almost killed Sun Mengru.

“Soul-Eating Silkworm!” Sun Mengru’s face turned pale, her voice trembling as she spoke.

“What?” Luo Tian and the others stopped at Sun Mengru’s words, their faces also turning pale as they looked at the adorable silkworm-like creature.

“It must be right. I never thought of it!” Sun Mengru’s face showed excitement, recalling the legend of the Soul-Eating Silkworm.

The Soul-Eating Silkworm lived for an entire era, its life comparable to that of a Era Master. Although it had an incredibly long lifespan, it had drawbacks: it couldn’t cultivate and could only transform itself.

The Soul-Eating Silkworm underwent three transformations in its life. The first was from a larva to a silkworm, the second from a silkworm to a butterfly (Soul-Eating Silkworm), which was its most important transformation. A Soul-Eating Silkworm that completed this second transformation had strength comparable to a Era-End powerhouse. If it completed the third transformation, turning from butterfly into human form, then this terrifying Soul-Eating Butterfly would be comparable to a Era Master.

Luo Tian and the others recalled ancient texts of the Demon Clan, their faces filled with awe as they looked at the tiny creature on Gu Lei’s head.

“It has devoured the Toxify Pearl and is undergoing its first transformation, changing from a larva to a silkworm!” Zheng Xin spoke in disbelief.

Luo Tian and the others looked at the tiny creature with excitement, as if viewing a priceless treasure. If they could truly subdue this little thing and it completed its final transformation, it would be like cultivating a Era Master.

Even now, this tiny creature had already reached the strength of a Saint-End powerhouse. That was no small feat. The ancient texts recording the Soul-Eating Silkworm were from several eras ago, when Era Masters were still numerous. At that time, a Saint-End powerhouse was insignificant. But now it was different; the world had changed, and a Saint-End powerhouse was no longer trivial.

“Is this little thing at the strength of a Saint-End?” Gu Lei and others looked doubtful, gazing at the Soul-Eating Silkworm.

“Crack…” The little creature seemed to ignore Luo Tian and the others, eating its original black shell.

“Ugh…” After finishing, it seemed to respond to Gu Lei’s call. It let out a sound and vanished from people’s sight.

In an instant, a scream echoed out. Gu Lei’s figure disappeared from Luo Tian and the others’ sight. He lay battered ten thousand feet away, his forehead bearing a large bump.

Luo Tian and the others couldn’t help but gasp. They took one look at this terrifying little creature and stepped back a few steps, their eyes filled with disbelief.

“Terrifying!” The only words that came to mind for Luo Tian and the others were these two.

Seeing the group’s reaction, the tiny creature, no bigger than a mung bean, rolled in the air. Its small eyes weren’t big but showed human-like satisfaction, as if saying, “Who dared to look down on me?”

“Damn it…” Gu Lei, dazed and confused, stood up. His face showed confusion before he saw his position. He returned to the group’s side, gazing at the tiny creature with anger.

“Little thing! You ate my Toxify Pearl. Does that mean you have to acknowledge me as your master!” Gu Lei’s eyes gleamed with greed, his mouth watering. He rubbed the bump on his forehead as he spoke to the Soul-Eating Silkworm.

The group looked at Gu Lei’s lecherous appearance. He was definitely a good candidate for being a human trafficker, like scaring children.

But the Soul-Eating Silkworm’s current intelligence was no better than a child. Seeing Gu Lei’s fierce expression, it shot out a thin thread from its body, instantly wrapping Gu Lei and rendering him completely immobile.

“Little thing! You…” Gu Lei was speechless, his bump still hadn’t subsided. The next moment, he couldn’t move at all. He had truly suffered a bad day.

“Ugh…” The Soul-Eating Silkworm ignored Gu Lei’s cries and flew toward Sun Mengru. Luo Tian felt a pang of worry.

Purple eyes flashed with light, and he sighed inwardly, grateful for his precautions. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to cope.

Luo Tian didn’t hesitate; he threw a punch toward the Soul-Eating Silkworm’s trajectory, directly launching his Dao Sealing Fist. No matter who it was, if it harmed Sun Mengru, no one would be spared.

But an astonishing scene occurred. Luo Tian’s punch successfully intercepted the Soul-Eating Silkworm’s trajectory.

However, he followed Gu Lei’s footsteps and was wrapped by a thin thread. His body exploded backward, disappearing from people’s sight. But the distance was slightly closer than Gu Lei's.

Sun Mengru looked worried, watching Luo Tian flying backward. She flew toward him to check if he was injured.

At the moment Sun Mengru stood up, the small silkworm-like creature stopped before her. Its tiny eyes showed a hint of apology and moved toward Sun Mengru, constantly wiggling its plump body. Sun Mengru’s eyes showed a smile; she had no resistance, as this little creature was too intelligent and adorable.

Sun Mengru tried to extend her finger, hoping the Soul-Eating Silkworm would land on it. To her surprise, the little creature actually landed on her finger. Its seemingly weak body gently rubbed against it.

“From now on, follow me, okay?” Sun Mengru spoke, her eyes filled with a smile. She looked at the Soul-Eating Silkworm with big eyes, knowing it could understand her words.

The Soul-Eating Silkworm’s tiny eyes showed confusion. It nodded its head slightly, then bit toward Sun Mengru’s finger.

Chapter 1056: Dare to Take It

“Stop!” Luo Tian stood up and caught the moment the Soul-Eating Silkworm bit Sun Mengru’s finger. Though he was far away, he saw it clearly and feared for Sun Mengru's safety. He instantly flew back to her side.

Luo Tian’s speed was fast, but not faster than the Soul-Eating Silkworm. Sun Mengru's finger immediately had a drop of blood, which merged into the Soul-Eating Silkworm’s plump body.

Sun Mengru furrowed her brows slightly, confusion in her eyes. Then a smile appeared on her face as she looked at the Soul-Eating Silkworm rolling on her finger.

“How are you? Do you feel any discomfort?” Luo Tian grabbed the Soul-Eating Silkworm with his hand, concern in his eyes as he examined Sun Mengru.

Sun Mengru smiled at Luo Tian’s anxious expression: “No problem. This little thing seems to have recognized me as its master!”

“What?” The group heard Sun Mengru’s words and Gu Lei shouted loudly, his eyes glaring at the Soul-Eating Silkworm before letting out a loud lament.
