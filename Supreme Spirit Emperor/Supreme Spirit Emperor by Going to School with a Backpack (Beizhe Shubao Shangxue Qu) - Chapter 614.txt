"Take revenge for us!" Finally, the elder of Huan Tian Sect looked at Chen Tianxin lying on the ground, his voice filled with madness.

"Boom..." The withered body of Huan Tian Sect's elder finally exploded, turning into ashes and vanishing from Luo Tian's sight.

"Take that soul-devouring stone!" The black-cloaked leader of the Mid-Immortal King level shouted, rushing toward the hovering Soul-Devouring Stone.

However, as the powerful figure moved, the black Soul-Devouring Stone emitted an overwhelming darkness, enveloping the entire Huan Tian Mountain.

"Crack... crack... crack..." The sword energy that had previously slain nine out of ten Huan Tian Sect disciples shattered continuously before this darkness.

"Rippling... rippling..." Terror-stricken demonic energy burst forth from the black Soul-Devouring Stone, enveloping everyone. A dark demonic dragon pattern coiled around a late-stage Immortal King powerhouse, penetrating their body.

Numerous dark demonic dragon patterns searched for prey, entwining around the black-cloaked warriors in the darkness.

"Ah! It's the Soul-Devouring Mind Technique!" Luo Tian recognized these demonic patterns.

"Damn it, why isn't my cultivation under my control!" A cry echoed through the demonic energy, even Immortal King level masters couldn't escape, being penetrated by several dragon patterns.

The black crystal-like Soul-Devouring Stone slowly descended, landing on Chen Tianxin's forehead like a demonic eye, emitting an eerie glow.

"Boom..." A black soul-devouring seed burst out of a late-stage Immortal King's body, flying toward Chen Tianxin. The Soul-Devouring Stone devoured this seed while dark demonic energy surged into Chen Tianxin's body, instantly expelling his divine energy from his body.

One... two... countless soul-devouring seeds continuously entered Chen Tianxin's forehead, and his cultivation constantly strengthened. After several hours, the black-cloaked warriors had their cultivation drained, falling from the sky one by one.

When Chen Tianxin's cultivation reached Mid-Immortal King level, he opened his eyes and inhaled all the demonic energy from the world. The Huan Tian Mountain returned to its original state.

"Kill..." Chen Tianxin's eyes swirled with demonic energy, and he slammed his palm onto the ground. An invisible wave spread outward, instantly turning the black-cloaked warriors into blood mist and killing them on Huan Tian Mountain.

"Originally, I was that soul-devouring embryo!" Chen Tianxin whispered to himself, his eyes filled with pain as two drops of black tears flowed from the corners of his eyes.

"Bountiful Heaven Mountain, Bountiful Heaven Mountain!" Chen Tianxin stood up, muttering continuously, his voice filled with overwhelming killing intent.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian felt a deep sorrow in his heart, but a powerful suction pulled his consciousness out.

"Body!" Luo Tian suddenly opened his eyes, finding himself lying in a grand hall. When he looked at the corner of the hall, his eyes filled with killing intent.

Chapter 2319: Unraveling the Secrets

In the dim hall, several figures lay there with their eyes closed. These were Luo Tian, Zhou Zhiwen, and Gu Qianxue among others.

Luo Tian opened his eyes, his gaze filled with murderous intent because in the corner of the hall lay a graceful figure, while another white-cloaked figure sat beside her.

"You woke up! I didn't expect you to follow us here!" Fu Bei's face showed a sinister expression, his eyes looking at Luo Tian who had just opened his eyes. His hand was on Gu Qianxue's thigh, gently touching it with a drunken look.

"You dare!" Luo Tian coldly spoke, trying to stand up but found his cultivation sealed, unable to move.

"I've been waiting for you!" Fu Bei slowly stood up, looking at Luo Tian with mockery.

"Do you like Qianxue? Unfortunately, she doesn't like you!"

"I remember the humiliation you gave me. Today I'll take her in front of your face, watching your painful expression, hahaha!" Fu Bei's eyes were filled with madness, looking at Luo Tian whose face was dark as water.

"You dare!" Luo Tian shouted, regretting not killing Fu Bei earlier.

"Give me the Bountiful Heaven Stone!" Luo Tian shouted while communicating with the Bountiful Heaven Stone.

"Master, I'm here. Don't worry, this restriction will take me half a moment to break!" The Bountiful Heaven Stone's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"No, give me thirty breaths. If you can't break the restriction, I'll kill you!" Luo Tian shouted mentally, his eyes filled with madness. He had no time to ask what happened to the Bountiful Heaven Stone before, he just wanted to break Fu Bei's restriction and kill him himself.

"I'll try my best!" The Bountiful Heaven Stone heard Luo Tian's madness and hot air radiated from Luo Tian's head, violently attacking the golden restriction in his body.

"Master, it might be painful. Bear it!" The Bountiful Heaven Stone spoke, but Luo Tian didn't care, his eyes fixed on Fu Bei.

"Fu Bei, do you think Qianxue will forgive you when she wakes up?" Luo Tian spoke to Fu Bei, his voice cold, while his body experienced intense pain, causing him to sweat.

"Maybe she will. Who knows?" Fu Bei laughed coldly, removing Gu Qianxue's hood to reveal her breathtaking beauty.

"Indeed a beauty. No wonder she's one of the top ten beauties in the Immortal World! I've seen Jiang Sichou from Yaochi, but she's no match for Qianxue!" Fu Bei's eyes glowed with lust, his fingers gently touching Gu Qianxue's face.

"I'll chop off your hands!" Luo Tian coldly spoke, his patience exhausted with Fu Bei.

"Then I'll see how you chop my hands!" Fu Bei started to undress Gu Qianxue, breathing heavily.

"Open..." As Fu Bei just took off Gu Qianxue's outer clothes, Luo Tian's energy burst out violently.

"Kill..." At the moment the restriction was broken by the Bountiful Heaven Stone, Luo Tian moved. His body flashed like lightning, rushing to Fu Bei's side and colliding with his body.

"Boom..." Fu Bei was occupied by desire, not believing Luo Tian could break his restriction. He was hit directly.

"Boom... boom..." The thunderous sound echoed, Fu Bei's body was knocked away by Luo Tian and crashed into the black wall of the hall. He spat blood, his eyes filled with disbelief.

"How is that possible!" Fu Bei's heart was in turmoil. His restriction came from the Eastern Emperor Sect, a technique of the Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Even an Immortal King would take time to break it.

"Damn it, a simple restriction wants to trap me!" The Bountiful Heaven Stone's weak voice echoed. Obviously, breaking the restriction was not simple.

Luo Tian's body surged with demonic energy, instantly appearing in front of Fu Bei. He punched Fu Bei's head.

Another thunderous sound echoed, Luo Tian's fist smashed onto Fu Bei's face. Fu Bei's entire face began to deform.

Fu Bei seemed like he was in a dream, instantly knocked out by Luo Tian. One punch caused massive cracks on Fu Bei's head, blood stained his head.

"that's how you chop!" Luo Tian's cold voice made Fu Bei清醒 a little, but a black demonic sword appeared in Luo Tian's hand. He slashed at Fu Bei's five fingers.

The sword fell, the fingers fell. Fu Bei's scream echoed in the hall.

Luo Tian held Fu Bei's neck with one hand, and with the other hand continuously pressed seals. The Hundred Ghost Sealing and Soul-Devouring Mind Technique were both injected into Fu Bei's body.

"What did you do to me?" Fu Bei shouted, his heart trembling. Looking at Luo Tian's eyes filled with killing intent, Fu Bei regretted deeply. He should have killed Luo Tian earlier instead of making him watch himself violate Gu Qianxue, leading to this outcome.

"You can't kill me. I'm a prodigy of the Eastern Emperor Sect. If you kill me, the Eastern Emperor Sect won't forgive you... Ah..." Fu Bei shouted but was soon replaced by a scream. His other five fingers also fell off, blood flowing from Fu Bei's two fingers onto the ground.

"What about the Eastern Emperor Sect? I've already killed one genius from the Eternal Life Sect. I don't care about another Eastern Emperor Sect!" Luo Tian's cold voice made Fu Bei desperate, instantly thinking of Nie Sheng who was just killed by Luo Tian. This person was a madman.

"Have the courage to release me and fight fairly!" Fu Bei shouted. He still had some survival techniques; if he used them, maybe he couldn't kill Luo Tian but could get a chance to escape.

"You're dreaming. I've already let you go once and twice. I won't let you go a third time!" Luo Tian coldly spoke, directly chopping off Fu Bei's legs. Another scream echoed.

"Luo Tian, you're not human. You're a devil!" Fu Bei shouted. The extreme pain made Fu Bei almost faint, but each time he was about to pass out, a strong spiritual force struck his mind, keeping him conscious.

"Yes, I am a demon cultivator!" Luo Tian coldly replied. This time he chopped off Fu Bei's hands, his voice filled with killing intent making Fu Bei desperate.

"Ugh..." As Luo Tian was torturing Fu Bei, Gu Qianxue took a deep breath. Her long eyelashes fluttered, and she slowly opened her eyes. Then she felt a chill on her face and a coldness on her body.

Gu Qianxue instantly froze, touching her face with her hands. She discovered her clothes had been taken off and her eyes filled with killing intent. Black ghost energy wrapped around Gu Qianxue's body, and after the ghost energy dissipated, her clothes were back on. Black ghost energy roared around Gu Qianxue's body like thousands of ghosts howling.

"Qianxue, Luo Tian wants to... to violate you. Kill him quickly!" Fu Bei saw Gu Qianxue waking up and shouted at her.

"Die!" Gu Qianxue's voice was cold. Her eyes showed madness, and she waved her hands. Her soul-ghost image flew out again. She opened her mouth and a black long sword appeared in her hand, emitting an overwhelming aura.

"This sword!" Luo Tian felt the trembling of Longyuan Sword on his back, and Mo Ming Sword also emitted a battle intent.

"Roar..." As he spoke, the black ghost image roared toward Luo Tian. Gu Qianxue also raised her sword to attack Luo Tian.

"Return!" Luo Tian coldly sneered, a black ghost seal hovering above his head. Dahei and Erhei also suddenly appeared, standing beside Luo Tian.

"Ghost Sealing Technique, Three-Headed Dog!" Seeing Dahei and Erhei, Gu Qianxue's expression turned serious. The ghostly creature that had reached Luo Tian's front also trembled, emitting groans. Black ghost eyes showed fear.

"Qianxue, it's been years. Why is your brain so dull!" Luo Tian spoke softly, picking up Longyuan Sword and instantly pushing Gu Qianxue back.

"I originally wanted to keep you a little longer, but now I have to kill you!" Luo Tian looked at Fu Bei still held in his hand and pressed his fingers.

"Boom..." Fu Bei's head was directly crushed by Luo Tian, and the half-body of Fu Bei fell to the ground.

"You..." Gu Qianxue looked at Fu Bei's corpse, her eyes filled with anger. Her black long sword emitted a dark glow and rushed toward Luo Tian again.

The black big sword flashed, colliding with Gu Qianxue's black long sword and pushing her back again.

"Qianxue, if you attack again, I won't be polite!" Luo Tian shouted. He grabbed Fu Bei's soul and pulled it out.

"Luo Tian!" Fu Bei's gray soul showed fear, the feeling of death making his soul tremble.

"Free me and I won't fight for Qianxue!" Fu Bei's soul shouted. At this moment, he was truly afraid.

"Don't mention Qianxue! Can you even call her that!" Nine-color flames erupted, starting to burn Fu Bei's soul.

"Dear wife, I'll show you something!" Luo Tian waved his hand, a crystal ball appearing in his hand. The recorded scenes from Fu Bei's room appeared before Gu Qianxue, making her pause slightly as she raised the sword again.

"Once I've taken her, I'll take you as my concubine!" Fu Bei's groaning voice echoed in the hall.

"There's more!" Luo Tian coldly spoke, looking at Gu Qianxue who had already stopped. He waved his hand again, the scene changed to Fu Bei's attempt to violate Gu Qianxue. Gu Qianxue's eyes showed coldness, her body trembling as she looked at Fu Bei howling in the nine-color flames.

"That lotus flower, is it yours!" Gu Qianxue coldly spoke, looking at Fu Bei who was howling.

Chapter 2320: Clearing the Soul Pavilion

"It's mine, it's mine! Qianxue, save me!" Fu Bei shouted, his soul twisting in pain. The extreme pain made him speak nonsense.

"Is it yours?" Luo Tian coldly smiled, the nine-color flames surged. At this moment, Luo Tian was fearless; his greatest fear was Gu Qianxue's deep misunderstanding and her possibly saving Fu Bei because of the lotus flower.

"Say it again, is it yours!" Luo Tian waved his hand again, several more lotus flowers hovering around him.

"You should die!" Gu Qianxue's face was cold, her black long sword suddenly burst out and slashed at Fu Bei's soul.

"Buzz..." However, just as the black sword was about to slash Fu Bei's soul, a black big sword blocked Gu Qianxue's attack. The big sword lifted and pushed away Gu Qianxue's long sword.

"Step back... step back..." Luo Tian took a few steps back, seeing Gu Qianxue was truly angry. His eyes softened as he looked at her.

"I'll kill him!" Luo Tian waved his hand, Longyuan Sword emitting an overwhelming cold light. It cut through the nine-color flames and split Fu Bei's soul in half, turning into swirling ashes around Luo Tian.

"Thank you!" Gu Qianxue finally understood. The lotus flower was given by Luo Tian, and it was also Luo Tian who had saved them twice before.

The Seven-Deadly-Snake Ghost should have been eaten by the Three-Headed Dog. The demonized corpse-eaters also feared the aura of Ghost Sealing Technique. And Luo Tian personally killed Fu Bei, protecting himself because Fu Bei's background was the Eastern Emperor Sect. Killing Fu Bei might bring the Eastern Emperor Sect's strength.

"I'm sorry!" Gu Qianxue felt a tremor in her heart, looking at Luo Tian. Her heart was touched and remembered the illusion she had experienced in Feng Huanzi.

"It's okay. We're family, don't say two different things!"

"I said, as long as I'm here, nothing will happen to you!" Luo Tian smiled gently. The nine-color flames swept over the scene, cleaning it up.

Gu Qianxue felt guilty and sheathed her sword. However, she still spoke softly: "How did you give me the lotus flower?"

"That's a secret!" Luo Tian blushed, fearing Gu Qianxue would know the truth and fight with him.

"Hmm!" Gu Qianxue didn't ask further, but she could guess some things and didn't act out. Her face under the black veil was slightly red.

"Luo Tian!" As they spoke, a voice shouted. It was Hunxuan standing up.

"Next, it's your turn! You're not a good one either!" Luo Tian flashed his body toward Hunxuan.

"What are you going to do!" Hunxuan shouted in surprise. He never expected Luo Tian would follow them inside.

"Luo Master, it's been a long time!" Jie Du stood up again, emitting waves of spiritual light. However, seeing Luo Tian rushing toward Hunxuan, Jie Du's face slightly changed and he moved to block Luo Tian.

"Move aside!" Luo Tian stopped, looking at Jie Du. He remembered how Jie Du had pleaded for him before and that from the beginning to now, Jie Du hadn't truly offended him. However, Jie Du was incredibly stubborn.

"Master, it's time to put down the sword. You've already lost your desire to kill me, which shows you're not too deep in demonizing. I'll guide you on the right path and help you achieve enlightenment!" Jie Du smiled, his expression was very satisfied as if Luo Tian not attacking him was due to his own reason.

"Go ahead! I'll take this bald monk!" Gu Qianxue flashed her body to Luo Tian's side. Although she didn't know why Luo Tian was causing trouble for Hunxuan, she felt guilty toward Luo Tian and naturally stood by his side.

"Master Gu, although you're a ghost cultivator from the Hell, you can still achieve enlightenment. My Mount Sumeru has many Buddhas who are ghost cultivators, and they've become enlightened. As the saying goes, 'If not me, who else?' I'm willing to be your guide!" Jie Du spoke again with a bunch of moral teachings.

"Ugh, you're so annoying. Can't your Mount Sumeru people get tired of your annoyingness!" Luo Tian moved his body, dodging Jie Du and rushing toward Hunxuan again.

"Om mani padme hum!" Jie Du recited the Buddha's name and took a step toward Luo Tian. However, a black long sword was already blocking Jie Du's path.

"Luo Tian! You don't think I'm afraid of you!" Hunxuan shouted, his hands moving. Gray soul seals flew from his hands toward Luo Tian, as he knew Luo Tian's body was too abnormal and he couldn't be his opponent.

"Soul like a blade!" Luo Tian coldly smiled, summoning the Soul Blade. It emitted an overwhelming aura and slashed toward the gray soul seal.

The gray soul seal was directly split by the Soul Blade, turning into swirling ashes that swept around the hall.

Hunxuan's face showed shock. He never expected Luo Tian's soul to be so strong, even stronger than himself.

"Roar..." Hunxuan waved his hand. A gray soul appeared beside him, clad in gray armor and holding a gray spear. It emitted an overwhelming aura. This was clearly a half-step Immortal King soul.

"Kill him!" Hunxuan's face showed a smile. This was one of his secret weapons, a half-step Immortal King soul he had cultivated.

"Roar..." The gray soul roared and rushed toward Luo Tian. Its speed was extremely fast, instantly reaching Luo Tian's front. The gray spear pierced through the void and aimed at Luo Tian's head.

Luo Tian showed a strange expression. He never expected the enemy would use a soul to attack him, which was clearly insulting him.

"Buzz..." The gray spear was about to pierce Luo Tian's head but suddenly stopped.

The gray soul trembled violently, its eyes filled with fear as it looked at Luo Tian.

"Kneel..." The next moment, the gray soul knelt before Luo Tian. Hunxuan was shocked. This secret weapon had rarely been used, always for killing enemies. It was the first time he saw it kneeling before his enemy.

"Damn it!" Hunxuan cursed, his hands forming seals. A series of soul patterns flew from his hands and were engraved into the half-step Immortal King soul's body.

"Roar..." The half-step Immortal King soul roared violently, even breaking the gray spear in his hand. However, it still dared not attack Luo Tian.

"Seal!" Luo Tian waved his hands, complex seals flew from his hands and were engraved into the half-step Immortal King soul's body.

"Buzz..." Black smoke flew from the half-step Immortal King soul's body, making the soul stop roaring.

"It's no longer under my control!" Hunxuan's face showed fear, shouting as he looked at Luo Tian smiling.

"Kill him. I'll let you truly seal and enter reincarnation! Keep your current memories!" Luo Tian spoke softly, looking at the half-step Immortal King soul kneeling before him.

"Roar..." The gray soul's eyes showed excitement. It flew forward and actively rushed toward Hunxuan.

"What's going on!" Hunxuan was completely stunned. This situation exceeded his imagination. He had never seen his cultivated soul attack himself before.

Hunxuan's face turned pale, watching the half-step Immortal King soul rushing toward him. He dodged and avoided its attack.

"Boom..." The gray spear pierced the spot where Hunxuan had just stood, exploding violently.

"Control it!" Hunxuan refused to believe and waved his hands again. Soul patterns flashed, striking the half-step Immortal King soul. However, the half-step Immortal King soul seemed impervious to all methods. Its body flashed like lightning and shattered the gray patterns.

In an instant, the half-step Immortal King soul appeared before Hunxuan. The gray spear condensed and swept toward Hunxuan.

"Crack..." Two of Hunxuan's ribs broke, his body fell backward and landed on the ground.

"Hunxuan roared. Knowing he was no match for Luo Tian and the half-step Immortal King soul, he waved his hand. A gray bottle appeared in his hands. He tapped the mouth of the bottle, and a soul's scream echoed from it.

"Flash... flash..."

Gray light flashed. A series of gray souls appeared in every corner of the hall, emitting an overwhelming aura. There were 9999 souls in total, with three hundred and thirty-three each of early-stage Immortal King, mid-stage Immortal King, and late-stage Immortal King.

"Soul Explosion!" Hunxuan shouted fiercely. He was quite心疼, but he knew if he fell into Luo Tian's hands, his fate would be bad. Therefore, he had to choose this secret weapon.

"Buzz..." As Hunxuan's words were just finished, those souls began to expand violently.

Luo Tian's face finally changed slightly. So many souls exploding would definitely be powerful. Even if he could block it, Gu Qianxue and Jie Du, as well as Zhou Zhiwen lying there, might not be able to block it.

"Seal Soul!" Luo Tian waved his hands. The aura of a Soul Sealing Master spread out, an overwhelming pressure from Luo Tian's body. He slammed his hands into the void.

"Rippling... rippling..." Souls like waves, the overwhelming pressure of a Soul Sealing Master instantly enveloped the entire hall.

As the wave spread, those souls about to self-destruct suddenly froze in mid-air. It seemed like they were suppressed by something, stopping their self-destruction.

"What's going on!" Hunxuan was completely shocked. He had felt something that could suppress him before, but he hadn't expected it to be so severe.

"Boom..." Hunxuan was stunned. The gray spear swept across his body again, knocking him away and landing at Luo Tian's feet.

Luo Tian took a step forward, directly stepping on Hunxuan's face. The gray cloth wrapped around Hunxuan's face exploded, revealing his face.

Luo Tian looked at Hunxuan. His eyes showed no restraint in killing intent, thinking about how Hunxuan and Fu Bei had conspired against Gu Qianxue.

Chapter 2321: The历代 Soul-Devouring Embryos

"Let me go!" Hunxuan weakly spoke, looking at Luo Tian. He had no real connection with Luo Tian, just once conspired against Gu Qianxue for Fu Bei. He was sure Luo Tian definitely didn't know.

"Let you go? Before in the Nine Heaven City, you and Fu Bei conspired against me. Did I not notice?" Luo Tian coldly spoke.

"Who is your wife!" Gu Qianxue shouted, hearing Luo Tian's words. At this moment, she had stopped fighting with Jie Du. Her goal was to block Jie Du; since he didn't attack, she wouldn't either.

"Ah, a slip of the tongue!" Luo Tian chuckled, applying force with his foot to make Hunxuan scream.

"You're getting me angry by taking it out on me!" Hunxuan mentally cursed, but he didn't dare say it aloud. Although he didn't know how Luo Tian had figured it out, Hunxuan knew today's matter couldn't be resolved peacefully. This person looked like a man who protected his wife fiercely.

"Luo Brother, this is a misunderstanding. I owed Fu Bei a favor before. Later he asked me to help, and I couldn't refuse!" Hunxuan screamed.

"Damn it!" Gu Qianxue understood immediately why Hunxuan had suddenly attacked her in the Nine Heaven City.

"So you should die. But I can let you die more easily!" Luo Tian coldly smiled, raising Longyuan Sword.

"I'm willing to compensate!" Hunxuan shouted desperately. Seeing Luo Tian's killing intent, his eyes showed despair.

"Master, it's better to be merciful!" Jie Du, although he had stopped fighting with Gu Qianxue, still shouted at Luo Tian. However, Gu Qianxue stared at him fiercely and wouldn't let him move forward.

"Lu Tian!" At this moment, Zhou Zhiwen and Yin Xiu who had entered the illusion before them also slowly woke up. They saw the souls spread throughout the hall and Luo Tian standing on Hunxuan's body.

"Don't!" Soon after, Zhou Zhiwen and Yin Xiu saw Luo Tian raising Longyuan Sword to strike Hunxuan. They both shouted.

The sword blade stopped at Hunxuan's throat, blood flowed out but didn't cut through his neck. This made Hunxuan's face sweat cold, and Luo Tian looked at Zhou Zhiwen.

"Luo Brother, the people of the Heaven-Soul Sect are all madmen. If you kill Hunxuan, the Heaven-Soul Sect will definitely retaliate. Then maybe even Bountiful Heaven Sect can't protect you!"

"Moreover, they'll use any means. They might even send a late-stage Immortal King to chase you. They'll find ways to kill you no matter where you are, even if you stay in Bountiful Heaven Sect!" Zhou Zhiwen spoke with concern.

Luo Tian had already killed Nie Sheng before. This matter wasn't over yet. If he killed another Hunxuan, it would be three sect disciples from the two major sects. Bountiful Heaven Sect might have to yield.

Luo Tian's eyebrows slightly furrowed. Zhou Zhiwen didn't know he had already killed Fu Bei. If he killed another Hunxuan, it would be three sect disciples.

"Imprison him and let him go!" Gu Qianxue softly spoke, making Luo Tian feel warm. He knew Gu Qianxue was finally not a stone; he had done so much and she started to care about him.

"Give my wife Qianxue a favor!" Luo Tian smiled, waving his hand. The Soul-Devouring Mind Technique spread out and entered Hunxuan's body.

"Soul-Devouring Mind Technique!" Zhou Zhiwen and Yin Xiu sighed longingly. They knew Hunxuan's second half would definitely live in fear.

"Frankly, I really dislike soul cultivators!" Luo Tian spoke softly, thinking of the Soul Clan from the Nine Regions that almost destroyed the Tianyuan Continent.

"If you don't oppose me, I won't take your cultivation!" Luo Tian spoke again, making Hunxuan's face slightly better.

"Rest assured, I swear from now on I won't be enemies with Luo Tian or those around him. I'll avoid him!" Hunxuan gritted his teeth and made a blood oath, making Luo Tian's eyes show satisfaction.

"Buzz..." Yin Xiu waved his hands. The power of plants spread out, and Jie Du also emitted holy light on Hunxuan's body. His injuries instantly recovered.

"Indeed, he has some talent!" Luo Tian looked at Yin Xiu and Jie Du, thinking to himself.

"Luo Master, you've finally turned back. This is a good beginning!" Jie Du spoke, making Luo Tian feel headache.

Hunxuan stood up and retrieved the souls in the gray bottle. This was his heart's treasure, a major technique of his. If it had met Luo Tian, if it had met others, even a half-step Immortal King would have been wounded. However, when Hunxuan saw the half-step Immortal King soul, his eyes looked at Luo Tian pitifully. That was also his powerful technique, but now it wasn't under his control.

"Complete my promise and send you to reincarnation!" Luo Tian looked at the half-step Immortal King soul, and punched with轮回 (reincarnation).

"Boom..." Reincarnation was everywhere. Even in this hall, it existed. A gray reincarnation channel appeared in people's sight.

"This is... a reincarnation channel!" Everyone gasped. Even Jie Du's face showed rare shock.

Gu Qianxue frowned, looking at Luo Tian with a different gaze. The Ghost King Sect was a rebel ghost cultivator. Although it was a rebel, it had once controlled a hell. Why it rebelled against the hell remained unknown. But it had deep knowledge of hell. Reincarnation's end was hell, and Gu Qianxue knew this. However, the Ghost King Sect recorded some reincarnation matters. No one had ever summoned a reincarnation channel in hell, not even the Ten Kings of Hell.

Luo Tian punched again. The seemingly solid reincarnation channel cracked a piece, and souls roared to escape.

"Return!" Luo Tian coldly spoke. The souls instantly stopped, continuing to wander in the reincarnation channel.

"Now is the time!"

"You have my mark. At the end, someone will recognize it. Remember to be loyal to the one who pulled you out of the Yellow Spring, and tell her I'm fine!" Luo Tian transmitted to the half-step Immortal King soul. At the same time, he continuously transformed his hands, imprinting seals on the half-step Immortal King soul.

"Roar..." The half-step Immortal King soul knelt on the ground, bowing three times to Luo Tian. It flew up and rushed into the reincarnation channel.

"Seal!" Luo Tian waved his hands. Soul energy flew out, repairing the gap in the reincarnation channel. The channel gradually disappeared from people's sight.

Zhou Zhiwen and others stared in amazement at Luo Tian, looking at him like a god. Their eyes even showed reverence.

"Luo Brother is the most talented person I've seen. There's no one else!" Zhou Zhiwen's face showed admiration, looking at Luo Tian.

"Luo Master is indeed incomparably talented. Even if he turns from demon to Buddha, he will surely achieve the great path!" Jie Du spoke softly. Although he praised him, three sentences were always about converting Luo Tian.

"Can you stop being so annoying? I'm a man with a wife!" Luo Tian sighed, standing beside Gu Qianxue.

"Where is this?" After solving everything, Luo Tian looked around the hall.

The hall was very ordinary. It was vast and dim. The walls had several copper statues, which were lifelike.

"There's no door. How do we get out? We fought but didn't damage the hall, obviously our current strength can't break out of this hall!" Gu Qianxue spoke softly.

"What did you all experience?" Yin Xiu asked, looking at everyone. He thought about his own illusion.

"I became a demon king and killed everywhere until I exploded!" Hunxuan spoke softly, making Luo Tian slightly shocked.

"It's different from me!" Luo Tian thought to himself. He had become the soul-devouring elder Chen Tianxin.

Others also spoke, trying to find clues but found that everyone's experiences were different.

"Chen Tianxin, Zhao Huan Tian..." Zhou Zhiwen spoke softly, muttering the names of Luo Tian and others in the illusion.

"They are the masters who have held the Soul-Devouring Stone!" Yin Xiu spoke softly, looking at the statues on the hall walls. He stood in front of one statue.

Luo Tian also saw Chen Tianxin's statue on the wall. Others found their own statues as well.

"There are inscriptions!" Luo Tian looked at the dense inscriptions next to Chen Tianxin's statue and spoke softly.

"I am Chen Tianxin, the seventh master of the Soul-Devouring Stone. I specially placed this stone in my cave. The Soul-Devouring Stone is a rare treasure of the world. I specially split it into five pieces. My cave has two pieces, and the other pieces are placed in other parts of the Immortal World!"

"The Soul-Devouring Stone is powerful. If it's combined, it can destroy heaven and earth. It will control the mind and turn into a world-renowned demon. If you don't have enough strength, never try to control the Soul-Devouring Stone!"

"The statues around this hall are the masters who have held the Soul-Devouring Stone. I am also one of them!"

"I don't want to be completely controlled by it, so I split this stone. I specially carved these statues of ancestors here. From now on, there are no more soul-devouring embryos!"

"Because of this stone, I became a powerful person who dominated the world. I did many wrong things. It also made me lose my relatives. Anyone who swore to destroy Bountiful Heaven Sect can qualify for the Soul-Devouring Stone!"

"Seeing these statues and stone walls means you've escaped from the illusion of the Soul-Devouring Stone. This stone contains the insights of past soul-devouring embryos. Although it's a demon technique, the path of cultivation is different but the goal is the same. It will definitely benefit you."

"Another piece is in my cave, which contains half of the Soul-Devouring Scripture. The remaining three pieces record another half of the Soul-Devouring Scripture, as well as the secret technique of Soul-Devouring Mind and the Soul-Devouring Illusion!"

The elegant handwriting contained overwhelming power.

"Ah, I see!" Luo Tian thought to himself. Looking at the inscriptions on the wall, he sighed deeply and understood why Chen Ba Tian and Huan Tian Sect's elder had looked at Chen Tianxin in the end.

Chapter 2322: Competing for the Soul-Devouring Stone

Clearly, Chen Ba Tian and Huan Tian Sect's elder knew that Chen Tianxin was a soul-devouring embryo generated by the Soul-Devouring Stone. They also knew why Chen Tianxin always slept for ten years, which was experiencing the memories of past soul-devouring embryos.

"Wait! Another piece records the Soul-Devouring Mind Technique!" Luo Tian suddenly realized something. That was where his Soul-Devouring Mind Technique came from, from Guan Hongsheng of the Lower Three Heavens' Chaos Sect.

"There's a piece of the Soul-Devouring Stone in the Chaos Sect!"
