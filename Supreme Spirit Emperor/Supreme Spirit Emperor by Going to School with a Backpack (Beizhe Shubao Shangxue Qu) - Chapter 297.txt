“With this strike, it could severely wound the era’s earliest days!” Manhai’s eyes flickered with fear as he gazed at the unparalleled sword light, his voice trembling.

Chapter 1233: Journey to Seven Star Island

South of Nangling, a golden sword qi cleaved through the heavens, radiating destruction and fury as it hurtled toward the colossal foot capable of shattering stars.

“Roar…” Manjiang let out a thunderous cry, knowing this was the decisive moment. If he could not withstand Luo Tian’s strike, he would be gravely wounded even if he survived. Luo Tian faced the same peril.

“Human race, you are truly formidable!” Manhai, who had previously lost, bore a tone of admiration as he gazed at Luo Tian’s towering figure, his eyes filled with disbelief.

“Crack…” In the next instant, under Manhai and Manhong’s stunned gazes, the golden sword light clashed with Manqi’s second technique.

Golden radiance erupted, a tempest of violent sword qi swept outward, tearing the earth away as it exposed the hardened stone beneath.

In their vision, the golden sword qi and Manjiang’s colossal foot clashed relentlessly until Manjiang could no longer endure. The golden sword severed half his body, sending him plummeting from the sky into a deep crater, blood spewing as he stained it crimson.

“Finally resolved!” Luo Tian exhaled heavily, his gaze falling upon Manjiang’s wounded form. A faint smile graced his lips, though blood spewed from his mouth—evidently wounded by Manjiang’s second kick.

“Elder Brother!” Manhai and Manhong flew to Manjiang’s side, dispelling the divine power that continued to erode his body.

“Cough… Truly formidable. The human race’s first prodigy indeed lives up to his reputation!” Manjiang spoke with reverence, his face pale as he began restoring his massive physique.

“Kill!” Luo Tian spat two more mouthfuls of blood. Though he admired the two蛮 clan prodigies’ character, he could only strike down. After all, the human and蛮 clans were now sworn enemies; allowing them to leave alive would mean adding several powerful foes to the human race.

The golden sword light flared again as Luo Tian wielded Wuya Sword, his feet pressing into the void. He swept toward them, and the sword’s golden radiance surged forth, its sharp aura sweeping over their forms.

“Invoke the clan relic!” Manjiang urgently commanded Manhong, knowing their current state could not withstand Luo Tian’s blade. Though Luo Tian was also battered, he fared far better than them.

“Good!” Manhong nodded, her hands moving as a wolf fang staff materialized in her grasp. She hurled it skyward.

“Roar…” A bestial roar echoed through the heavens, emanating a savage and bloodstained aura. It was evident that this staff had been stained with the blood of countless warriors, its divine essence still potent despite the years.

“These back-stabbing prodigies are truly troublesome!” Luo Tian halted, sensing the wolf fang staff was no ordinary weapon. It surpassed his Wuya Sword significantly, having been refined by an era’s master. Though crude in appearance, it was undeniably formidable.

Luo Tian had no shortage of past experiences with relics refined by era masters, though they were weaker than true era treasures. Still, they could crush most pseudo-era relics.

“Let you live for now,” Luo Tian shook his head, realizing that with the wolf fang staff at play, he could not defeat these three giants immediately. He chose to retreat instead.

“Roar…” As Luo Tian turned, a blood wolf emerged from the staff, its eyes crimson and body radiating a thirst for blood. It lunged toward Luo Tian.

“Return!” Manjiang barked, summoning the wolf back with a flick of his hand. He addressed Luo Tian: “Go, next time I shall defeat you!”

“Haha, always ready. Next time we meet, your luck won’t be so good!” Luo Tian laughed, whistling into the sky.

“Crack…”

Lightning descended; Zidian Bird, its body wreathed in thunderous electricity, appeared before Luo Tian. In an instant, it carried him away from Manhai and the others’ sight.

“Huff…” Luo Tian sat cross-legged on Zidian Bird, exhaling deeply. Though battered and wounded, he felt a sense of relief, his eyes glinting with satisfaction: “The first battle against the蛮 clan was quite satisfactory!”

“The overall strength of this蛮 clan continent surpasses that of the Nine Realms, but with the absence of the Shadow Domain’s troubles, the Nine Realms’ cultivation speed must have improved. I wonder how many era masters have emerged? And what of my old companions—have any reached the era level?” Luo Tian murmured, sitting cross-legged on Zidian Bird’s body as he began restoring his mangled flesh.

Though Luo Tian seemed victorious, his injuries were severe. In this荒大陆, he had no medicinal pills to aid recovery, relying solely on his qi—inevitably slowing the process.

“Seems I’ll need to craft some medicinal pills later,” Luo Tian muttered, closing his eyes as the wind blew across his body.

Zidian Bird soared through the skies at ten thousand feet, heading toward the heart of the蛮 clan continent—the Forbidden Temple.

Time passed slowly. After three days, Luo Tian’s wounds finally healed, his flesh mending as the jagged scars vanished.

Three days later, a rumor spread across the蛮 clan: the human race’s first prodigy, Guan Xingjian, had appeared on the continent. Alone, he had fought and wounded two of the Forbidden Temple’s prodigies, Manhai and Manjiang. Had they not invoked their clan relic, they would have faced death.

Instantly, the name of Guan Xingjian, the human race’s first prodigy, echoed across the蛮荒 continent. The Forbidden Temple issued a decree, mobilizing the entire蛮 clan to search for Guan Xingjian. Those who provided information would be rewarded heavily, even the other royal clans stationed in the蛮荒 City joined the hunt.

Unexpectedly, someone had indeed spotted Guan Xingjian’s presence—but not in the southern Nangling. Instead, it was in the western part of the蛮荒 continent, prompting all the clan’s strength to rush toward the Western Forest.

“How could I be discovered when I was so discreet?” In the dense forest, a figure stood coldly, his back bearing a green long sword as he muttered.

This was the true Guan Xingjian, who had come to seek a human race elder’s inheritance. He never expected his trail would be discovered.

“Never mind, I’ve come this far—no turning back!” Guan Xingjian gazed at the misty forest ahead, taking a step forward and vanishing into the fog.

Meanwhile, the real Luo Tian was leisurely reclining on Zidian Bird’s back, heading toward the human race’s encampment—Seven Star Island.

Purple feathers, soft as silk, concealed Luo Tian’s presence; no one below the era level could detect him.

“Stealing a day of leisure, little Zidian—do you wish to transform? Say something nice, and I might help!” Luo Tian smiled, burying his face in the feathers as he addressed Zidian Bird.

“Truly?” Zidian Bird’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, filled with joy. As a super beast, it could transform fully, but with the tenth domain sealed and beasts’ status plummeting like humans’, even their transformation methods had been lost.

“Of course, who else but me? I always keep my promises!” Luo Tian, for once, indulged in a little mischief.

“You’ve flown across the entire蛮荒 continent and met many prodigies, but none like you. No! You’re no longer a prodigy—you are a monstrous force destined to rule the蛮荒 continent. You are the human race’s treasure, like the moon in the sky, only to be gazed upon. No—by all tribes!” Zidian Bird’s voice resonated in Luo Tian’s mind, nearly causing him to fall off.

“Damn it, that works!” Luo Tian had merely spoken idly, but the bird responded immediately.

Suddenly, Luo Tian recalled a person—a minor figure from the Tianyuan continent’s Beichang County, Wu Di. After the previous Shadow Domain upheaval, Wu Di had died in his fight against the Shadow Domain. When they first met, Wu Di had flattered him excessively.

“Sigh…” Luo Tian sighed deeply, reflecting on the countless lives lost along his path. Even those who had crossed paths with him had met untimely ends.

“Alright,” Luo Tian sighed, extending a hand to transmit the transformation method into Zidian Bird’s mind.

Luo Tian had always maintained good relations with beasts, so he knew the transformation method. For him, it was of little use, and passing it on to Zidian Bird posed no issue.

“Buzz…” Zidian Bird’s purple eyes glowed with excitement, immediately activating the method Luo Tian had given it. Purple lightning surged around its form.

In an instant, a woman in purple robes emerged from the lightning, bathed in divine thunder.

“Damn it, she’s a female!” Luo Tian widened his eyes, his mouth twitching as he stared at Zidian Bird transformed into a woman in purple attire.

Chapter 1234: Seven Star Sea

Zidian Bird, under Luo Tian’s gaze, transformed into a young woman. Though not stunningly beautiful, her aura carried an unusual charm.

“You bastard! Why did your voice sound like a man before!” Luo Tian’s mouth twitched, recalling the times he had ridden Zidian Bird, feeling awkward.

“Thank you,” Zidian Bird stepped forward, bowing respectfully to Luo Tian with gratitude in her voice.

“Um… go back first; I can manage the rest alone!” Luo Tian felt awkward, addressing Zidian Bird.

“You’ve done me a favor; I’ll accompany you!” Zidian Bird, still grateful, bowed again.

“No, no need—already troubled enough!” Luo Tian’s face was awkward as he waved his hands.

“Human form—how did you achieve it?” Just as they hesitated, a low voice echoed in their ears. Luo Tian and Zidian Bird both startled.

“Rippling waves…” Water roared as they realized they were now in the sea.

“Seven Star Sea!” Zidian Bird’s face was complex, gazing at the endless sea.

The waves surged as a colossal creature broke through the surface—unmistakably a massive whale.

“Truly enormous!” Luo Tian marveled, the whale’s size dwarfing him like an ant.

“Who are you? Why have you entered the Seven Star Sea?” The massive creature spoke, its voice laced with authority.

Its eyes then locked onto Zidian Bird’s human form, breathing heavily as Luo Tian caught the salty scent.

“Respectful disciple Luo Tian seeks to return to the human race, passing through the Seven Star Sea. I beg your guidance,” Luo Tian bowed respectfully to the whale.

Luo Tian sensed this whale was no ordinary foe; merely not being able to fathom its cultivation level indicated its formidable nature.

“This is the Seven Star Dragon Whale, master of the Seven Star Sea. This sea hosts the Seven Star Island, where sea beasts and humans unite to resist the蛮 clan—this is the first defense of Seven Star Island. If I’m not mistaken, this old whale is the true ruler of the Seven Star Sea. Unexpectedly, I’ve drawn him out!” Zidian Bird’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, startling him.

“How did you achieve human form?” The Dragon Whale gazed at Zidian Bird, its oppressive aura subdued but still causing her to tremble.

Zidian Bird hesitated, glancing at Luo Tian, unsure whether to reveal him. If she did, and the Dragon Whale turned hostile, Luo Tian would be helpless.

“It was my disciple who taught her,” Luo Tian understood Zidian Bird’s dilemma, smiling as he bowed to the whale.

“Transformation! You know how to transform? Ha!” The Dragon Whale opened its mouth, causing the entire Seven Star Sea to churn. The sky darkened as laughter echoed across the sea.

“Rippling waves…” As the Dragon Whale’s laughter resounded, figures of massive size emerged before Luo Tian, obscuring the sky.

“Grandfather, what did you say?” A black water xuan gui appeared beside the Dragon Whale, its shell resembling a mountain.

“He knows how to transform!” The Dragon Whale gazed at Luo Tian, its eyes like the sun, burning with admiration.

“Boom…” The beasts’ heavy breathing echoed as they stared at Luo Tian, making him tremble. Who could remain unshaken under the gaze of so many titans?

“Friend, can you teach us? This transformation method has been lost on this continent!” The Dragon Whale lowered its dignity.

“Of course, of course!” Luo Tian nodded quickly, sensing if he refused, these titans would tear him apart.

“Buzz…” He extended a hand, golden seals swirling toward the Dragon Whale’s head, imprinting images into its mind.

“Ah! I see now!” The Dragon Whale’s face lit up, exhaling countless divine rays that filled the sky before entering its body.

Golden light descended, and the Dragon Whale’s massive form gradually shrank until it stood as an elderly man before Luo Tian and the beasts.

“Haha! Finally transformed—old man can now walk on land!” The Dragon Whale laughed, a triumphant grin on his face.

“Grandfather, teach us!” The beasts implored, their eyes eager.

“Haha! Good, good!” The Dragon Whale’s mood brightened, exhaling water bubbles that struck each titan.

“Boom…” The beast horde erupted into chaos, and under Luo Tian’s amazement, each titan condensed into human forms—men, women, old and young.

“Friend, thank you for your help. Please visit our underwater realm; let us repay your kindness,” the Dragon Whale smiled, inviting Luo Tian into the ocean.

“Yes, little brother, come sit with us! You don’t know how long we’ve struggled with this transformation problem. Without it, we couldn’t enter the human world. Now I can experience human life!” The beasts, now in human forms, still filled the sky.

“This…” Luo Tian’s mind stirred; arriving at Seven Star Island was unfamiliar, but building relations with these sea beasts would be beneficial. Their strength was undeniable—only by uniting with humans could they guard this place against the蛮 clan.

“Respectfully, I accept your invitation,” Luo Tian bowed slightly to the Dragon Whale, signaling Zidian Bird could depart. After all, he had two children to care for.

“Let’s say we’re friends. If you need anything, don’t hesitate to come find me at Seven Star Island,” Zidian Bird transmitted before leaving. Her body paused, then nodded with a complex expression before vanishing as a purple lightning bolt from Luo Tian and the sea beasts’ sight.

“Let’s go!” The Dragon Whale spoke, ignoring Zidian Bird’s departure, and waved a hand to disperse the waves, leading toward the Seven Star Sea’s depths.

Luo Tian was escorted by the sea beasts into the underwater world, finding it amusing. A simple transformation—common in the Nine Realms where even a beast could transform at the魂凝聚 stage—but here, no beast could. Perhaps this was one of the Nine Realms’ advantages; many traditions had been lost here.

In a grand palace, sea beasts in human forms conversed with Luo Tian, and during the feast, they laughed and chatted.

Luo Tian naturally had a dragon clan bloodline, so he favored beasts rather than seeing them as enemies. He preferred conversing with beasts; they were more straightforward than the蛮 clan.

The feast lasted until late, and Luo Tian retreated to his underwater residence, amazed by it.

“Friend, you wish to enter Seven Star Island?” The Dragon Whale appeared beside Luo Tian like a ghost, startling him.

“Yes, I assume you have a way? Your reputation should easily get me in!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully, gazing at the Dragon Whale.

“Of course, but you must tell me your origin and identity. I’ve never heard of a human in Seven Star Island reaching this level!” The Dragon Whale’s face bore authority, its eyes flashing with divine light.

“Don’t misunderstand, I am indeed human and not a蛮 clan spy. However, I do not belong to this domain,” Luo Tian spoke, his voice carrying a hint of无奈 as he revealed the truth—his origin was the Nine Realms.

“Nine Realms!” The Dragon Whale’s face showed shock, his gaze on Luo Tian filled with disbelief. A dragon who had lived countless years could discern the truth in his words.

“Indeed!” Luo Tian seemed lost in memories, recounting his journey to the Dragon Whale, who was moved and later sighed.

“Alas… if you wish to return to the Nine Realms, it may be impossible. Honestly, Seven Star Island’s humans have long studied how to return to the Nine Realms!” The Dragon Whale spoke, his voice filled with无奈.

“As far as I know, the entire荒大陆 and other royal clans’ domains have only one entrance to the Nine Realms. It was sealed by a human era master, making it nearly impossible to break through! Even if you could escape, would the蛮 clan let you pass through their Forbidden Temple?” The Dragon Whale gazed at Luo Tian, his face showing无奈.

“Alas…” Luo Tian sighed deeply; he knew returning to the Nine Realms was nearly impossible. Worse, it might bring these ancient royal clans into the Nine Realms, making him a traitor. With their hatred for humans over the years, he doubted these clans would coexist peacefully with humans in the Nine Realms.

Chapter 1235: Encounter with the Mad Elder

In the dim sea, an old and young figure walked slowly. Each step covered thousands of feet—Luo Tian and the Dragon Whale, the master of Seven Star Sea.

After a night of conversation, Luo Tian decided to stay one night in the Seven Star Sea before heading to the only human settlement on the vast蛮 clan continent—Seven Star Island.

The Dragon Whale also accompanied Luo Tian to check out Seven Star Island, as without him, Luo Tian would never find it in the vast ocean or set foot on it.

Luo Tian was glad to have such a powerful figure accompany him; he estimated the Dragon Whale’s cultivation level at least mid-era, possibly higher. Having such a protector would save him many troubles on Seven Star Island.

Their speed was fast, but after half a day of flying, the sea surface rose thick mist, prompting the Dragon Whale to stop.

“This is Seven Star Island. Here lies the first defensive measure—Mirage Mist, a formation crafted by Seven Star Island’s formation masters. It can trap强者 below the sage peak! This single formation has kept most蛮 clan warriors at bay!” The Dragon Whale spoke.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly. Though he didn’t know formations, he had some understanding. Such a formation could be easily set by Jiang Nanxuan or Nan Gongling. This formation might trap the蛮 clan’s sage peak, but it couldn’t hold the Nine Realms’ sage peak.

“This formation, talismans, and medicinal pills’ traditions are too broken here!” Luo Tian sighed, his purple eyes flashing with divine light as he found the formation’s weakness. He could easily break it.

“Let’s go!” The Dragon Whale smiled, stepping into the mist, while Luo Tian followed calmly.

They felt no disturbance from the illusion and eventually saw a massive island a hundred miles away.

The蛮 clan continent was vast, but this island’s size was roughly comparable to the former Tianyuan Continent.

“This is the second defensive measure. Unlike the first, it harbors infinite killing intent. Even I must be cautious to enter. Be careful and follow my steps!” The Dragon Whale’s face was solemn, recalling Luo Tian’s casual attitude during the illusion.

“Yes,” hearing the Dragon Whale’s words, Luo Tian nodded slightly, his carefree mindset lifting.

“Let’s go!” The Dragon Whale took out a jade pendant, emitting a buzzing sound that enveloped them. He stepped into the seemingly ordinary sky.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian’s brow furrowed, sensing the Dragon Whale’s solemnity. His mood instantly heightened; if even the Dragon Whale was cautious, he had to abandon his arrogance.

“Buzz…” As they stepped into the calm sky, it instantly transformed into another scene—overwhelming killing intent swept toward them.

“This is!” Luo Tian’s heart trembled, feeling the wild killing intent surrounding him. His body tensed instantly.

“Era power! Correct, this killing formation has a fragment of an era master’s pattern. Even if one is in the late era, without this jade pendant to protect them, they could be crushed here. Even if they survive, they’d be gravely wounded! This is Seven Star Island’s greatest killing tactic, the reason the蛮 clan dare not attack it!” The Dragon Whale’s aged face showed awe as he gazed at the wild killing intent, his eyes filled with fear.

The emerald jade pendant buzzed, repelling the fierce killing intent. Their vision blurred, and the calm sea surface vanished; Luo Tian even saw stars in the sky being extinguished by the era power’s killing intent.

“This damn thing!” Luo Tian trembled, stunned by Seven Star Island’s formidable barrier.

“Buzz…” The emerald light rose from the Dragon Whale’s jade pendant, as if responding to something. It flew forward on its own.

“Follow it; it will lead you to Seven Star Island!” The Dragon Whale smiled, addressing Luo Tian, who was awestruck.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian had no more arrogance now; if caught by the killing intent, he wouldn’t survive a breath.

They walked through the wild killing intent, following the green jade pendant slowly.

After an hour, they still hadn’t exited this legendary killing formation but felt waves of disturbance in their hearts.

“What is it? I’ve entered this formation before, but never felt such waves!” The Dragon Whale’s mind stirred, his gaze turning cautious.

Luo Tian also felt the waves but had no choice but to follow the jade pendant. If they explored outside, it would mean death.

As they continued walking, the waves grew closer, making them hold their breath and be cautious.

“See!” The Dragon Whale’s face trembled, his eyes filled with disbelief as he pointed.

Luo Tian followed the Dragon Whale’s direction, and his eyes flashed with purple light before he too was filled with fear.

“A person!” Luo Tian exclaimed, his eyes wide with shock—unexpectedly finding someone in this legendary killing formation.

A towering figure stood within the formation, unharmed by its fierce killing intent. Black and white qi surrounded his body, his hair disheveled as if a madman, with crimson light flickering in his eyes.

“East… Eastbo Xin… elder!” Luo Tian’s heart surged with waves, his body trembling slightly.

As they approached the figure, Luo Tian confirmed it was Eastbo Xin.

Luo Tian never expected to meet Eastbo Xin here. After Eastbo Xin left, he had vanished without a trace—even during the Shadow Domain’s upheaval, Eastbo Xin hadn’t appeared. Yet now he was here in the荒大陆.

“Is he well?” Luo Tian gazed at the towering figure, trembling. If Eastbo Xin had regained his mad state, he and the Dragon Whale would not survive.

“This person is a human!” Luo Tian replied, unsure how to introduce Eastbo Xin, only sighing helplessly.

The crimson light gradually faded, and Eastbo Xin’s eyes returned to normal—black and white. He sensed Luo Tian and the Dragon Whale, gazing at Luo Tian before giving a slight nod and stepping forward into the wild killing intent.

“Elder Eastbo, how did you enter this star domain? Is there a way out?” Luo Tian’s heart surged with excitement, shouting toward Eastbo Xin’s direction.

But only the wild killing intent responded; no sign of Eastbo Xin returning. Luo Tian even felt an urge to break out of the jade pendant’s range and chase after Eastbo Xin.

“You know him?” The Dragon Whale was truly terrified; such a figure could crush them effortlessly, even an era master’s fragment of the killing formation couldn’t harm him. This showed his power had reached heavenly levels.

“Yes, I’ve met him a few times before. He helped me several times. Now he’s stronger!” Luo Tian murmured, his gaze filled with longing.

Hearing Luo Tian’s reply, the Dragon Whale’s eyes changed—having such a powerful figure behind Luo Tian meant no one in the entire蛮 clan continent, or even the Origin Domain, could challenge him.

“Regretfully, I couldn’t converse with Eastbo Elder. If I could ask how to escape this star domain, it would be ideal!” Luo Tian sighed deeply; Eastbo Xin’s appearance had shocked him greatly.

“Perhaps reaching the late era would allow crossing through,” the Dragon Whale patted Luo Tian’s shoulder, offering comfort.

“Hmph, no matter what, I must return to the Nine Realms. There are too many attachments there!” Luo Tian murmured, walking with the Dragon Whale through the wild killing intent.

After another hour of travel, they finally exited the formation, exhaling a long breath as they saw a jade pendant identical to the one the Dragon Whale had used to guide them floating in the sky.

“Who are you? How did you enter our Seven Star Island!” As they exhaled, a voice barked at them. Several young figures descended from the sky, gazing down with superiority toward Luo Tian and the Dragon Whale.

“Descend!” The Dragon Whale, unimpressed by their lofty gaze, barked a command. His oppressive aura enveloped the young men.

“Boom…” The disciples were only of the super beast level, their strength no match for the Dragon Whale. They fell to the ground instantly.

“Hey, your elders never taught you respect for the elderly?” The Dragon Whale sneered, his gaze filled with authority.

“Hmph! I’ll go for a walk now; I need to stay low-key. If you have any troubles, take this and find me. In the human race, my old face is still valuable!” The Dragon Whale extended a scale, placing it in Luo Tian’s hand. His body vanished from Luo Tian and the young men’s sight.

“…You old man really finished your bragging, leaving this mess for me?” Luo Tian stared at the scale in his hand, watching the young men’s pitiful state. He couldn’t help but speak.

Chapter 1236: Arrival at the Island

“Who are you two?” Seeing the Dragon Whale vanish, the young men slowly stood up, gazing at Luo Tian and asking.

“I am human; I wish to meet Seven Star Island’s island master!” Luo Tian smiled awkwardly, addressing the young men.

“Damn it! The old one left; can we still handle this kid?” A rotund young man cursed, his body rising with a massive form. Though plump, he still had some presence.

“Exactly! I’ve already informed the third island master; he’ll be here soon! We’ll capture this kid first and force him to reveal the old one’s whereabouts. Even the蛮 clan dare not enter Seven Star Island, yet two humans have dared so boldly!” Another young man echoed, his body surging toward Luo Tian.

“Damn it!” The other young men roared, flying into the sky and diving toward Luo Tian.

“Ugh…” Luo Tian was speechless, patting his forehead as he gazed at the young men’s furious eyes. A half-era aura surged from him, enveloping the youths.

“Can’t we talk this out?” Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice filled with无奈.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” The youths flew fast but fell faster, their bodies crashing to the ground with a heavy thud.

“Half-era!” The rotund young man stammered, his eyes filled with disbelief. He hadn’t expected a youth to have reached half-era cultivation.

“Who are these two? One old man is terrifying, and this youth is also a half-era powerhouse. Is there any justice left?” The young men, under Luo Tian’s aura, couldn’t stand up. They sighed in despair, having been defeated twice by an old and young pair within minutes.

“I am human; I wish to meet Seven Star Island’s island master!” Luo Tian smiled, not harming the young men but keeping his smile as he withdrew his aura.

“Which island master do you wish to meet? Seven Star Island has seven island masters!” The rotund young man stood up, no longer daring to provoke. He had never encountered a half-era before.

“Any one of them is fine!” Luo Tian was indifferent, as he didn’t know anyone on Seven Star Island.

“I’ve already informed the third island master; he’ll be here soon!” One young man spoke, standing behind the rotund one with reverence.

“Good, I’ll wait then!” Luo Tian, being a newcomer, didn’t want to be too bold. He stood there with an innocent smile, waiting for the third island master, Shen Gongfu’s arrival.

As Luo Tian waited, the young men pondered, gazing at the calm Luo Tian and wondering about this powerful youth’s origin.

“Half-era! Seven Star Island has fewer than ten half-era cultivators. Where did this person come from?” The young men thought repeatedly, waiting for the third island master’s arrival.

“Buzz…” Finally, under the young men’s anxious gaze, a sound of breaking air echoed. Several figures descended from the sky, their bodies radiating powerful aura as they appeared in Luo Tian and the young disciples’ sight.
