“Again him?” Feng Changming turned his gaze toward Luo Tian, his eyes filled with solemnity. The Epoch Treasure—something few could even glimpse—this boy possessed a half, and even Feng Changming marveled at Luo Tian’s luck, deeming it unparalleled. It was the only one he had encountered in his long years.

“However, even with the Ancient Heaven Palace, you still lack depth! After all, I am in the middle of an epoch. You still have little chance!” Feng Changming’s face bore a faint smile as he activated the Demon Emperor’s Mirror, his gaze laced with disdain. As one of the domain’s foundational figures, he was confident that by wielding the Demon Emperor’s Mirror, he could subdue all.

“Hmph. Do you think being a foundational figure makes you invincible in this epoch?” Jiang Nanxuan’s face bore a cold glint, exchanging a glance with Luo Tian as if seeking his opinion.

Upon seeing Jiang Nanxuan’s gaze, Luo Tian understood the meaning behind it. His brows furrowed slightly before he turned to Diao Yuanshan, whose face had paled to the extreme. A ruthless glint flickered in Luo Tian’s eyes as he gave Jiang Nanxuan a firm nod.

Chapter 1,178: The Madness of the Demon Awakens

Under the starry sky of the Fire Domain, Jiang Nanxuan exchanged a glance with Luo Tian. Upon receiving his confirmation, he turned his gaze toward Feng Changming, still maintaining a calm expression but with an undercurrent of mockery.

“You are growing more intriguing each time. I wonder what other secrets you hold! Regrettably, my time is limited!” Feng Changming felt his vitality waning. A sigh escaped him as he waved a hand, releasing the cry of a phoenix from within his body. A crimson wave of epoch power surged forth, flowing into the Demon Emperor’s Mirror.

The hum of resonance echoed as the might of the Epoch surged again. A blinding light erupted from the Demon Emperor’s Mirror, as if capable of erasing all existence. The radiant column pierced through the stars, pushing toward Luo Tian and his companions.

“Unresistable. Even with the Ancient Heaven Palace activated, I cannot withstand it. The middle of an epoch wielding the Demon Emperor’s Mirror—this is terrifying!” Diao Yuanshan sighed, his hands releasing an endless flow of violet qi that transformed into inscriptions, flowing into the Ancient Heaven Palace and the Yin Fish Tortoise Armor.

“Senior, no need for you to act!” Luo Tian intercepted Diao Yuanshan before he could fight on, a smile playing on his lips.

“Boom!” Jiang Nanxuan stepped forward among the crowd. Facing the light column capable of erasing all, his face remained calm. His hands formed seals as a vast array manifested in his grasp.

The thunderous echo resounded, golden inscriptions appearing beneath the starry sky like stars drifting through space. The inscriptions radiated a transmission power, causing Feng Changming’s expression to shift slightly.

The Ancient Altar emerged from the void, encircled by black and white qi. Dongbo Xin sat in meditation upon it, like a monk deep in contemplation. His massive body exhaled and inhaled rhythmically with Dongbo Xin’s breath, the black and white qi pulsing accordingly.

“‘This!’” Feng Changming’s first change of expression. His eyes held fear as he gazed upon Dongbo Xin, who appeared like a demon god. He felt an overwhelming presence from him, even causing himself to be awestruck.

“Ping…” Jiang Nanxuan leapt onto the altar, his purple long zither lying beside him. Unperturbed by the apocalyptic light from the Demon Emperor’s Mirror, he remained calm, his eyes fixated solely on the ancient zither.

The “Lingxiao Prelude” was played, its melodious notes echoing across the starry sky. Even Luo Tian and his companions, who had been restless, found their minds calming, admiration in their eyes.

“Burst…” Unlike Jiang Nanxuan’s composure, Dongbo Xin seemed to awaken a demon god. Slowly opening his eyes, the Taiyin and Taixiang rose together, emitting lightning that shattered space. The countless black inscriptions chains on his body exploded one by one before him.

“Dual Cultivation of Gods and Demons! I understand now. He is Dongbo Xin, and he still lives!” Feng Changming’s face bore disbelief. The legendary figure of Dual Cultivation of Gods and Demons, who had been a myth in their era, was likened to the second god-demon master. Yet Dongbo Xin had vanished into the Nine Domains, leaving no trace.

“Roar…” The melodious zither notes reached Dongbo Xin’s ears, calming his wild fluctuations. His eyes now held clarity.

As Dongbo Xin regained a sliver of lucidity, the apocalyptic column from Feng Changming’s Demon Emperor’s Mirror reached Luo Tian and his companions’ altar.

“Go!” Dongbo Xin, eyes cold with resolve, swung a fist. His power surged skyward, swallowing mountains and rivers without fear. It clashed with the apocalyptic light.

“Damn! Who is this? So strong!” Gu Lei and Zheng Xin, protected by the Ancient Heaven Palace and Yin Fish Spirit, looked at Dongbo Xin as if gazing upon a mountain—unreachable.

“Epoch Late! Such terrifying strength, confronting an Epoch Treasure without falling behind!” Diao Yuanshan’s face bore admiration, his voice laced with reverence.

“Crack…” The thunderous sound resounded. The starry sky exploded again, black and white qi bursting forth from the void.

“Stomp… stomp…” Dongbo Xin took several steps back, each step leaving deep imprints on the altar. His eyes were profound, his arms marked with wounds. Blood flowed down his fingers—clearly, his bare-handed clash with the Epoch Treasure had left him injured.

Yet to the onlookers, this was awe-inspiring. Previously, even the apocalyptic light capable of erasing a middle epoch had only caused Dongbo Xin to shed a few drops of blood. This proved his unparalleled might.

“Hmph, I miss the feeling of being wounded after so many years!”

“Regrettably, it was wielded by a middle epoch being with dwindling vitality. If it had been at its peak, even I would have paid a heavy price!” Dongbo Xin muttered, his words filled with respect for the Epoch Treasure. After all, it was an artifact forged by the Epoch Master himself. Though mighty, Dongbo Xin remained but a drop in the ocean before an Epoch Master.

“Kill!” Knowing Jiang Nanxuan had awakened him, Dongbo Xin understood the dire situation. The only one capable of killing Luo Tian and his group was Feng Changming with the Demon Emperor’s Mirror. Thus, without hesitation, Dongbo Xin surged forward like a flood of beasts toward Feng Changming.

Feng Changming’s face darkened. He had previously acted with arrogance, holding the Demon Emperor’s Mirror as if he ruled over all. Now, seeing Dongbo Xin, Feng Changming realized he had no chance against him—just as Diao Yuanshan had been. Especially with Dongbo Xin’s vitality undiminished.

“How have you lived so long?” Feng Changming, holding the Demon Emperor’s Mirror, sought to fight Dongbo Xin with all his might.

“You’re not worthy of knowing!” Dongbo Xin’s aura was resplendent. He swung a fist, striking the golden mirror surface of the Demon Emperor’s Mirror. The sound of Dao resonated, invisible waves blowing back his jet-black hair.

“Crack…” Another thunderous sound. Dongbo Xin’s fist struck the Demon Emperor’s Mirror, his body retreating several steps with fierce battle intent.

Compared to Dongbo Xin, Feng Changming fared worse. Though the Demon Emperor’s Mirror absorbed most of his power, Dongbo Xin’s fist still caused Feng Changming to spit blood. His hands gripping the mirror shattered.

The Epoch Treasure, the Demon Emperor’s Mirror, also flew from his grasp, falling onto the slowly healing starry sky. Feng Changming’s eyes were filled with horror.

“Grandpa, you’re so strong!” Gu Lei, Zheng Xin, and Xu Liziyi shouted, gazing at Dongbo Xin’s overwhelming aura with admiration.

“Old man Feng, you were so arrogant! Don’t be so smug now! You just bully us younger ones!” Xu Liziyi, seeing Feng Changming’s pitiful state, couldn’t help but curse. His gaze held mockery.

“Cough… cough…” Hearing Xu Liziyi’s curses, Feng Changming spat more blood. His body had become haggard. Being ridiculed by juniors was unbearable.

“Boom…” Before Feng Changming could speak, Dongbo Xin surged forward again. His thick fist thundered toward Feng Changming.

“Damn it!” Without the Demon Emperor’s Mirror, Feng Changming had no choice but to face him head-on. He raised his fist, clashing with Dongbo Xin’s.

“Boom…” Blood surged skyward. The crimson phoenix blood scattered across the starry sky, making the elders of the Demon Domain pale.

“Done!” Seeing Feng Changming—so powerful—be shattered by Dongbo Xin, the elders’ faces bore despair. They had witnessed Feng Changming’s strength, yet he was so fragile before Dongbo Xin. Two punches shattered him.

They knew the domain’s foundation could only afford one life. If killed once, they would lose vast reserves of vitality and couldn’t regenerate through blood-dropping. This was the greatest difference between foundation and true equals.

Thus, if two middle epoch masters met—one a domain’s foundation, the other an equal in this epoch—the foundation would never match the latter. Therefore, Feng Changming was now dead.

Two punches shattering a foundation—Dongbo Xin’s combat power had reached an unparalleled level. He was undoubtedly the undefeated ruler of the Nine Domains.

Indeed, after Feng Changming’s destruction, the crimson phoenix blood scattered and never reformed. It gradually lost its divine essence, swept into the void by wild fluctuations.

“Haha! Old man Feng, come here and let me chop off your head!” Luo Tian and his companions glared at the elders of the Demon Domain, their eyes filled with hostility.

“Diao Xiong, we’ve been together for so long. Let us go!” Feng Zǔ spoke, his gaze turning to Diao Yuanshan with a pleading look.

Chapter 1,179: The Arrival of the Mortal Domain

Under the starry sky of the Fire Domain, several elders of the Demon Domain stood with grim faces. Feng Zǔ’s face was pale as he gazed at Diao Yuanshan, his eyes filled with a plea.

“I gave you chances before. You didn’t cherish them!” Diao Yuanshan’s face was equally pale, his gaze deep and cold.

The forbidden technique “Fang’s Path” had been activated by Diao Yuanshan. He knew what awaited him. He didn’t want his soul to be lost after death, leaving Diao Dezhu’s safety in the Demon Domain unprotected. Without these elders, Feng Jiutian was dead. The only threat to Diao Dezhu in the Demon Domain would be its foundation.

“Even if the Demon Domain’s strength declined, it has nothing to do with me!” Diao Yuanshan thought, his gaze deep as he looked at the elders.

Dongbo Xin stood there without further action. He knew these Demon Domain elders weren’t worth his effort. Luo Tian and the others could handle them.

Luo Tian and his companions felt triumphant, charging toward the elders like wolves. They had been too oppressed before—when a middle epoch master nearly wiped them out. If not for Jiang Nanxuan’s arrival, they would have been annihilated.

“How are you doing? Has it improved?” Jiang Nanxuan stood beside Dongbo Xin, his gaze filled with concern. As the original body of the Heaven and Demon Flower, he had nurtured Dongbo Xin for so long. There was an indescribable bond between them, as they had accompanied each other for so long.

“I’ve improved a bit. I found some methods, but I still can’t fully control it,” Dongbo Xin’s determined face bore a bitter smile.

“It will be fine!” Jiang Nanxuan patted Dongbo Xin’s broad shoulder, offering reassurance.

“Haha! Old man, don’t run away!” As they spoke, Luo Tian clashed with the elders. A thunderous fluctuation arose from their collision.

Luo Tian wielded the Shattering Heaven Spear, like a god of death. He relentlessly chased after Feng Zǔ, the only elder at the peak of Sainthood among them. Others also targeted an elder, striking repeatedly.

The elders had previously declined in power and couldn’t recover within this short time. Facing the blood-qi of Xu Liziye and Long Jie, they looked desperate, desperately maintaining their stance.

“Hmm?” As Luo Tian and the others relentlessly pursued the elders, Dongbo Xin’s expression changed. Black qi slowly rose from his body, his eyes gradually turning murky.

“So soon?” Jiang Nanxuan saw Dongbo Xin’s expression and knew he might be going mad. He quickly prepared to seal him.

“I’ll try! Don’t interfere with me for now!” Dongbo Xin roared, his aura becoming even more violent. His eyes held determination as he sat in meditation beneath the starry sky, black inscriptions wrapping around his body. His figure flickered between light and dark, his face serious to the extreme. An unusual aura radiated from him, forming an invisible field that pushed Jiang Nanxuan and Diao Yuanshan back a hundred feet.

“Saint Domain! This senior has formed a Saint Domain. Such an achievement is only possible for an Epoch Peak master!” Diao Yuanshan’s face changed, his voice trembling as he saw the雏形 of the black and white Saint Domain.

“Indeed, he has touched the threshold of an Epoch Peak,” Jiang Nanxuan, who knew Dongbo Xin best, nodded with a smile.

“Someone has arrived! They are strong. Be careful!” Dongbo Xin sat within the black and white Saint Domain, his eyes suddenly opening. Cold sweat flowed down his face as he warned Luo Tian and the others to be cautious.

Hearing Dongbo Xin’s words, Jiang Nanxuan and Diao Yuanshan were startled. They turned their gaze toward the distance, eyes filled with concern.

As Dongbo Xin’s words finished, a repressed pressure spread into their minds. A powerful pressure made Diao Yuanshan’s gaze deep.

“Hmm?” The heavy pressure caused Luo Tian and the others, who had been relentlessly pursuing the Demon Domain elders, to stop. They turned their gaze toward the distance.

“Boom… boom… boom…” The starry sky fractured. Thunderous sounds echoed across the stars, a grey flood coming from distant space, crushing toward Luo Tian and his companions. Everything in its path turned into vacuum.

“What is this!” Luo Tian’s hearts trembled, gathering together. They gazed toward the distant stars.

The grey flood pushed through the starry sky, destroying everything—stars and continents alike. It turned into a haze of grey smoke beneath the stars, amplifying its overwhelming power.

“Thousands… hundreds…” As Luo Tian and his companions gazed in shock, the grey flood arrived at their hundred miles away. They could now see its true form.

“Mortal Domain!” Luo Tian and his companions gasped, their minds shocked.

Before them were countless grey figures. A grey-cloaked elder stood at the forefront, his power level indicating an early epoch. His eyes held endless coldness—this was the ninth elder of the Mortal Domain.

Behind him were nine young men, their eyes filled with killing intent. Among them were three Luo Tian had fought before—Ming Yuan, Ming Li, and Ming Hong. No doubt these nine were the Mortal Domain’s Nine Sons.

Behind them stood dozens of elders at the peak of Sainthood, following closely. They were clearly there to protect the Nine Sons.

Behind these stood countless Mortal Domain people—men and women, old and young. Their power levels varied, but the weakest was beyond the ordinary. The sheer number of them—over fifteen million—left Luo Tian stunned after a moment’s calculation.

“The Mortal Domain has attacked! Luo Tian, are you still going to kill us?” Feng Zǔ’s heart trembled. Seeing the Mortal Domain’s terrifying strength, they felt a chill. They hadn’t expected their power to be so formidable.

As Luo Tian and his companions observed the Mortal Domain’s forces, the Mortal Domain also noticed them. The elder, Ming Yongzhi, slowly stopped his advance. His fifteen million troops halted instantly, their gazes turning toward Luo Tian and the others with cold glints. A powerful pressure radiated from each of them, making Luo Tian and his companions feel oppressed.

“Luo Tian! I didn’t expect to meet you here!” The elder, Ming Yongzhi, bore a look of solemnity. He gazed at the Ancient Heaven Palace hovering above Luo Tian and the Demon Domain elders’ heads, as well as Dongbo Xin’s figure on the massive altar. He spoke softly.

Especially when he saw Dongbo Xin, who had his eyes closed, Ming Yongzhi’s face changed. A hint of fear surfaced in his heart. However, seeing Dongbo Xin’s closed eyes, he felt reassured and smiled again.

Luo Tian activated the Ancient Heaven Palace to protect everyone. He knew that the Mortal Domain’s massive force had come to the Fire Domain, intending to annihilate it. With such strength, if the Fire Domain faced them, it would be crushed.

“Ming Yongzhi. Have you forgotten me? Do you think these people can swallow the Fire Domain? This turmoil has united our eight domains. Are you sure the Mortal Domain can withstand it?” Diao Yuanshan, a veteran warrior, knew the elder’s name. His gaze was deep as violet qi radiated from his body. However, Luo Tian noticed a fleeting exhaustion in Diao Yuanshan’s eyes.

“Last gasp. If you were at your full strength, I might have feared a little. But now? You fools are already in mutual destruction. It saves me the trouble of acting. That Epoch Late master, I suppose he’s also preoccupied,” Ming Yongzhi said with a sneer, addressing his Mortal Domain forces.

“Children, fight!” Ming Yongzhi’s words ended. He immediately rushed forward toward Luo Tian and his companions.

“Kill!” A fierce killing intent filled the starry sky. The Mortal Domain forces roared, shattering vast stretches of space as they charged toward Luo Tian and his companions.

“I won’t kill you. Whether you live or die depends on your luck!” Luo Tian’s gaze was deep as he spoke to the Demon Domain elders. Clearly, their immediate priority was dealing with the Mortal Domain’s attack.

With that thought, Luo Tian moved his hands, launching the Yin Fish Tortoise Armor. The Demon Sun ascended, forming a star that pressed down toward the Mortal Domain’s forces.

Diao Yuanshan also bore a cold glint in his eyes, activating the Ancient Heaven Palace to unleash its overwhelming pressure toward the Mortal Domain.

“Demon Emperor’s Mirror!” The Demon Domain elders, having recovered some Saint power, combined their efforts to activate the Demon Emperor’s Mirror. A radiant light of the Epoch surged forth, pushing toward the Mortal Domain.

Two true Epoch Treasures—their power was terrifying. Even against the fifteen million Mortal Domain forces, if no method could block it, they would suffer heavy losses. After all, these were artifacts imbued with a fragment of the Epoch’s might. The Yin Fish Tortoise Armor also possessed terrifying power, both being rare treasures sought after by the Nine Domains. Only a few sects possessed such items.

“Boom… boom…” A heavy pressure instantly invaded the minds of every Mortal Domain member. Some at the level of beyond ordinary were shattered, their bodies turning into blood mist that stained their companions.

“Two Epoch Treasures. It’s a bit tricky, but your current injuries mean your power isn’t as strong!” Ming Yongzhi gazed at the two Epoch Treasures in the sky, his eyes deep. He waved a hand, releasing blood qi. A green copper pot appeared in Luo Tian’s view.

Chapter 1,180: The Mindless Slaughter

Under the starry sky of the Fire Domain, the Ancient Heaven Palace, Demon Emperor’s Mirror, and Yin Fish Spirit radiated Epoch power. A massive pressure pressed toward the Mortal Domain’s forces. If truly struck by three Epoch Treasures, the Mortal Domain would suffer heavy losses.

But the Mortal Domain had been silent for so long. They knew about the Epoch Treasures of various sects and were well-prepared.

The green copper pot flew from Ming Yongzhi’s hand. It radiated terrifying power, matching the Demon Emperor’s Mirror and Ancient Heaven Palace in both aura and pressure. In fact, under Ming Yongzhi’s control, its power was even stronger than Diao Yuanshan’s Ancient Heaven Palace.

“I also have an Epoch Treasure. This is the Blood-Refining Pot, my Mortal Domain’s Epoch Treasure. I believe it can block your two!” Ming Yongzhi spoke softly, his voice laced with disdain. After all, Diao Yuanshan was in terrible condition now. If truly faced off, he was confident of killing Diao Yuanshan—just a matter of time.

The green copper pot tilted, spilling endless blood qi. It flooded the entire starry sky, making the already crimson Fire Domain’s stars even redder.

A line of blood dragons roared out, instantly enveloping the Ancient Heaven Palace and Demon Emperor’s Mirror. They obscured people’s vision.

“Luo Tian, I, the Mortal Domain, will dominate the Nine Domains. Today, you are doomed!” Ming Yuan, who had nearly been killed by Luo Tian before, bore a cold glint as he spoke.

“He is the one you called Luo Tian? Leave it to me!” Before Ming Yuan, a youth with blood-red eyes stood. He wore grey robes and licked his crimson lips before addressing Ming Yuan and the others.

Seeing the youth speak, Ming Yuan and the other eight sons did not continue. They stood behind him.

Ming Hun, the first son of the Mortal Domain, had followed the first great master of the Mortal Domain for years. He was sealed within the ninth domain’s land, and even the Mortal Domain didn’t know Ming Hun’s true strength. This attack on the Nine Domains saw him emerge from the ninth domain, immediately reaching the peak of Sainthood. No one dared question his status among the Nine Sons.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, gazing at the youth who had spoken. A strong sense of danger filled him. He knew this battle with the youth would be his most challenging against an equal. Plus, there were fifteen million Mortal Domain forces—another formidable force they couldn’t抗衡.

“Boom… boom…” As Luo Tian pondered, the three Epoch Treasures vanished from sight. It seemed as if a hidden force had drawn them into the void. Diao Yuanshan and Ming Yongzhi’s figures also disappeared from their original positions, obviously engaging in a life-or-death battle with the Epoch Treasures in the void.

“We can’t retreat. Behind us is our homeland. If we retreat, our loved ones and friends will die! We must withstand it!” Luo Tian spoke, his voice cold and resolute. He moved forward toward the Mortal Domain’s forces.

“Kill!” Long Jie, Xu Liziye, Chen Zhanbiao, and others followed Luo Tian. They joined together like an arrow, rushing toward the Mortal Domain’s forces.

“This is our only chance to escape!” Feng Zǔ’s face bore a wild look. They hadn’t planned to fight the Mortal Domain but to escape. As for the Demon Emperor’s Mirror, they never thought it would be taken by the Mortal Domain or Luo Tian. The Epoch Treasure had a soul; it would return to the Demon Domain’s capital on its own. Their current goal was to pass through the Mortal Domain forces and return to the Demon Domain, ensuring they remained elders of the domain.

“Kill!” Ming Hun moved forward with his forces, rushing toward Luo Tian and his companions.

Luo Tian and Ming Hun stood at the front of their respective forces. Their golden and grey fists collided.

“Crack…” Both were at the peak of Sainthood, their collision producing thunderous sound. People around them couldn’t approach.

After a brief clash, they instantly separated, both bearing expressions of shock. Especially Luo Tian’s face held disbelief.

Though they had only exchanged a single punch, Luo Tian had used his full strength—Fangtian’s attack, breaking all laws. The power of the Dao was fully concentrated. In short, among the Nine Domains, few could withstand Luo Tian’s punch.

Yet in this clash, Luo Tian felt that Ming Hun had suffered no real damage. This was the first time in his years of experience that he saw someone besides Chen Zhanbiao who could withstand his attack.

Compared to Luo Tian’s shock, Ming Hun was no better. He knew his own strength—Sainthood peak was nothing to him. Though he had fought rarely in recent years, the first great master of the Mortal Domain had allowed Ming Hun to emerge because he knew no one in the Nine Domains could kill him.

“Kill!” When they wanted to continue attacking each other, they were overwhelmed by the Mortal Domain’s forces. They could only sense each other’s positions but couldn’t kill each other due to the many people in between.

Luo Tian had no choice but to keep killing the surrounding Mortal Domain forces. His golden Shattering Heaven Spear repeatedly pierced through, and his golden fists struck again and again. Each attack caused massive casualties among the Mortal Domain forces.

Not only Luo Tian, but Long Jie and Xu Liziye also were scattered by the Mortal Domain’s countless forces in a single moment, fighting separately.

But fortunately, the Mortal Domain’s people had varying levels. For now, they weren’t in danger—just continuously slaughtering the Mortal Domain’s forces.

The scent of blood slowly drifted through the starry sky. In a blink, Luo Tian and his companions were stained with blood. A continuous barrage of martial arts struck their bodies.

Among them, Gu Lei had the least pressure. As a poison cultivator, this mass combat was his favorite. Especially killing these low-level disciples, death surrounded him in waves.

“Ten thousand… a hundred thousand…” In just one hour, Luo Tian and his companions had killed a hundred thousand disciples.

But a hundred thousand Mortal Domain disciples were but a drop in the ocean compared to their fifteen million. It made no real difference. However, Luo Tian and his companions were exhausted in this short hour. They had just escaped the pursuit of the Demon Domain’s master Feng Changming, and now they were fighting bloodily. The toll on Luo Tian and his companions was immense.

Luo Tian and his companions knew they had to endure without any luck. They could only slaughter, endlessly slaughtering. To kill the Mortal Domain’s many people was unrealistic for them. They were waiting, awaiting reinforcements from the Fire Domain and the Four Saint Star Domains. Once they arrived, the situation would reverse.

The Mortal Domain’s fifteen million were strong, but their true strength relied on Ming Yongzhi and the Nine Sons. Numerically, the Fire Domain and Four Saint Star Domains had nearly a million more warriors. However, in terms of high-level forces, Ming Yongzhi’s Epoch Treasure could annihilate most of the two domains.

Fortunately, Diao Yuanshan was still in the Fire Domain. Otherwise, if truly attacked by the Mortal Domain, they wouldn’t know how to respond.

The battle continued. Blood qi surged skyward. No one noticed that the blood qi from the countless Mortal Domain disciples killed by Luo Tian had seeped into the massive altar where Dongbo Xin sat, gradually flowing into his body with chaotic black and white qi.

Time passed slowly. An hour slipped by unnoticed. Luo Tian felt numb, his remaining Saint power nearing exhaustion. He moved his fists mechanically, worrying about Zheng Xin and Gu Lei’s safety.

“Thankfully, those I brought were skilled at survival. Otherwise, someone might have perished here!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, silently praising his decision.

“Roar…” As Luo Tian and his companions mindlessly slaughtered the Mortal Domain people, a low roar echoed from the massive altar. A powerful pressure made the entire battlefield pause as if time had stopped.

The ancient black altar, once dark and old, now turned blood-red. Blood inscriptions flowed across it, eventually gathering into Dongbo Xin’s body.

“Trouble!” Jiang Nanxuan, covered in blood, suddenly changed expression. He felt something unpredictable had happened to Dongbo Xin—perhaps the battlefield’s blood qi had affected him. He regretted not keeping an eye on Dongbo Xin while fighting the Mortal Domain.

Dongbo Xin opened his eyes again, but this time, two red glows pierced out from them.

“Luo Tian, run! Dongbo Xin seems to have lost control!” Jiang Nanxuan urgently transmitted his thoughts to them, then flew up to break through the encirclement.

But breaking out was extremely difficult. After an hour of fighting, their surroundings were still a sea of people.

The blood-red eyes saw the battlefield filled with残肢 and blood qi. His red glows grew even fiercer.

“Flee!” Sensing Dongbo Xin’s awakening, Ming Yongzhi opened the green copper pot and lifted its lid. It seemed he had sealed the Nine Sons of the Mortal Domain into it via some contract.

“Flee!” With Ming Yongzhi’s command, the Mortal Domain forces wouldn’t linger. The pressure from Dongbo Xin was too great—enough to repel a thousand armies.

“Roar…” Dongbo Xin, like a bloodthirsty beast, roared. The starry sky trembled as he vanished from the altar and appeared among the fleeing Mortal Domain forces.

An invisible wave stirred endless blood mist. Black and white qi spewed from Dongbo Xin’s mouth, instantly annihilating countless Mortal Domain disciples.

“Run!” Seeing Dongbo Xin’s mad demeanor, Luo Tian’s face slightly changed. This Dongbo Xin was terrifying—more so than before. He seemed like the ruler of the entire starry sky, a death god emerging from hell. Each punch sent massive numbers of Mortal Domain disciples screaming and annihilating in his hands.

Luo Tian didn’t dare to delay. He feared Dongbo Xin might accidentally kill him. He moved against the crowd, fleeing in the opposite direction of the Mortal Domain’s retreat.

Gu Lei, Zheng Xin, and Jiang Nanxuan also looked grim as they slaughtered again. They finally broke through the Mortal Domain forces, their bodies bloodied and eyes filled with exhaustion. After exchanging glances and confirming no one had died, they all sighed in relief.

“Buzz…” Diao Yuanshan, his face pale, appeared with the Ancient Heaven Palace and stood beside Luo Tian. He turned his gaze to Jiang Nanxuan.

“What should we do?” Luo Tian asked, his voice filled with worry. He feared Dongbo Xin’s madness might destroy the Fire Domain.

“I have no solution. I can only try my best!” Jiang Nanxuan shook his head. Releasing Dongbo Xin was a double-edged sword. Though it could annihilate enemies, it might also harm themselves—always ready to explode.

Yet Jiang Nanxuan was surprised. Dongbo Xin had previously said he had found some ways to control himself. Now it seemed he had failed, and perhaps the blood qi had caused him to enter a mad state faster.

“Kill…” The Epoch Late Dongbo Xin, in his madness, was terrifying. He seemed like a human killing machine. Every movement shook vast stretches of space. The Mortal Domain forces, like wheat swayed by the wind, fell in waves.

“Should we leave?” Luo Tian and his companions panted heavily. They gazed at Dongbo Xin, who slaughtered the Mortal Domain people like a bloodthirsty god. These people were nothing more than ants to him.

“Stay behind me! I’ll wait here. He won’t hurt me!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly. At this moment, the Mortal Domain forces were preoccupied. With Dongbo Xin as a variable, this attack had failed completely. Even Ming Yongzhi had fled with the Nine Sons immediately. What about others?

Slaughter, endless slaughter. The entire starry sky trembled as a river of blood flowed into the void.

“I’ll stay with you!” Luo Tian, worried about Jiang Nanxuan’s safety, decided not to leave.
