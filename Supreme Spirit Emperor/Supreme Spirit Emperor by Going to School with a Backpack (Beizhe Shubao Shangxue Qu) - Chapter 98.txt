Chapter 479: Seeking Death

Not only did the disciples of the Dan Sect display expressions of shock, but even Cold Hongcai and Zheng Hongsheng, along with the heads of several major sects, felt their minds tremble. The pressure emanating from the Soul-Subduing Cauldron made even those at the peak of the Nascent Soul stage feel a sense of unease.

Zheng Xin's face bore an expression of emotion. He naturally knew that the Soul-Subduing Cauldron was a treasure, and even the formidable Three Thousand Burning Flames had been subdued by it. This demonstrated the terrifying power of the cauldron.

Such a treasure, yet Luo Tian had offered it as a wager. Though part of the reason was not due to himself, this matter had arisen because of him. He wanted to speak but, upon seeing Luo Tian's smiling gaze directed at him, swallowed his gratitude and words.

"Bet!" Yang Kaiji’s breath grew heavy, almost without hesitation, he agreed.

"Old bastard, your plan is quite good. This cauldron's value needs no explanation. You think you can get it for free? You're the fool, don't assume others are fools. Show your wager, or this is off!" Luo Tian's lips curled slightly upon seeing Yang Kaiji fall into his trap.

"Hmm?" Hearing the deep confidence in Luo Tian's words, Yang Kaiji furrowed his brows.

But before Yang Kaiji could speak, Yang Hongguang grew restless, gazing greedily at the Soul-Subduing Cauldron: "What do you want?"

Yang Hongguang's face bore an air of boundless arrogance. To him, the Soul-Subduing Cauldron was already his. Lose? Impossible. His alchemical skills were clear to him; among peers, he had no rival. Even some elders of the Dan Sect paled in comparison to him.

"If I win, I want the Jade Crystalline Luminous Flame!" Luo Tian's gaze locked onto Yang Kaiji, speaking each word deliberately.

"Uh..." The crowd's faces showed shock. Everyone knew that the Dan Sect’s three ancestral flames had never been obtained by outsiders.

Upon hearing Luo Tian's condition, the Dan Sect disciples hesitated, turning their gazes toward Yang Kaiji.

Yang Kaiji's brows furrowed, his face displaying contemplation. Though he had confidence in his grandson, this matter involved the Jade Crystalline Luminous Flame, and he had to proceed with caution.

The Jade Crystalline Luminous Flame was not Yang Kaiji's own; it had been borrowed from an old eccentric of the Dan Sect when he left, to bolster the sect's prestige. He would have to return it eventually.

"Ah, Yang Senior, are you afraid to bet?" Luo Tian's face bore mockery as he gazed at Yang Kaiji.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the eyes of the three sect leaders flickered with interest. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to push Yang Kaiji into the same predicament he had faced earlier.

First, using a precious treasure to get Yang Kaiji to agree, then setting his conditions to trap him in a dilemma.

"Grandpa, bet!" Yang Hongguang spoke toward Yang Kaiji, his gaze filled with disdain. To him, Luo Tian was merely trying to use such conditions to force his grandfather to retract the bet. He saw no real talent in Luo Tian.

Yang Kaiji, having lived for countless years, naturally guessed Luo Tian's intentions. But this struck at his vital point; the Jade Crystalline Luminous Flame could not be lost, even if he knew this was a sure win. He had to deliberate carefully.

"Grandpa, bet! This cauldron is an invaluable treasure. He's just putting on a show. Do you still not trust my alchemical skills?" Yang Hongguang spoke, his words brimming with confidence.

"Good!"

"I'll bet! If you win, I’ll give you the Jade Crystalline Luminous Flame! The marriage contract remains!" Yang Kaiji panted heavily, speaking to Luo Tian with a smile.

"Brave! Yang Senior truly is brave!" Luo Tian felt a flicker of joy, speaking loudly.

All eyes were on Luo Tian and Yang Kaiji; they hadn’t expected their stakes to be so high. The Jade Crystalline Luminous Flame and the high-level Soul-Subduing Cauldron—each was a treasure that could serve as a sect's pillar.

"Hmph, let you gloat for now. When this cauldron changes hands, you’ll have reason to weep!" Yang Hongguang thought with a cold laugh.

"Alright, let's discuss the rules first!" Zheng Hongsheng and others displayed interested expressions.

"Uh... the rules?" Upon hearing Zheng Hongsheng's words, their faces showed a moment of awkwardness. They had been so focused on the bet that they hadn’t considered the rules yet.

"Since those present are my elders, let them decide the rules! I believe no one would favor another!" Luo Tian spoke.

Yang Kaiji had no objections; after all, these were influential figures who wouldn’t risk their reputations over the rules.

Zheng Hongsheng, Cold Hongcai, and Duan Chenfeng decided to summon several elders from the Wind-Storm Sect who understood alchemy to serve as judges. The competition time was set for the next day.

After discussing related matters, they returned to the accommodations arranged by Zheng Hongsheng, preparing for the competition the next day.

...

Luo Tian smiled as he walked with the Wind-Storm Sect disciples to his quarters, under everyone's gaze.

As soon as he entered the room, Luo Tian shut the door and summoned the Soul-Subduing Cauldron. His alchemy no longer used other cauldrons, but exclusively the Soul-Subduing Cauldron.

A continuous stream of herbs flew from his hands into the cauldron, and soon, a fragrant aroma filled the room.

Luo Tian held a fourth-tier elixir in his hand, his gaze thoughtful: "Now that I can craft fourth-tier elixirs effortlessly and fifth-tier without issue, it's still not enough. These days have been spent in battles; I haven’t truly focused on alchemy!"

"Yang Kaiji risked the Jade Crystalline Luminous Flame to bet, so Yang Hongguang's alchemical skills must be unmatched among his peers. Fifth-tier alchemists are rare, but within the Dan Sect, they aren’t exceptional!" Luo Tian muttered quietly, his gaze returning to the Soul-Subduing Cauldron. His flame surged again, striking the cauldron's fire mouth.

Yang Kaiji’s quarters...

Upon hearing his disciples' report, Yang Kaiji and Yang Hongguang exchanged smiles: "Indeed, it was a show. But even last-minute preparation doesn’t apply to alchemists!"

One night passed quietly. Except for Zheng Xin, Cold Qiuchan, and Duan Yuyan visiting once, no one else disturbed Luo Tian’s room.

At dawn, Luo Tian withdrew his hand from the Soul-Subduing Cauldron, a smile on his face: "Jade Crystalline Luminous Flame, today you are mine!"

At the same time, Yang Hongguang sat on his bed in his quarters, eyes opening with a confident gaze: "Luo Tian, today I’ll make you lose face!"

Chapter 480: The First Item
Chapter 480: The First Item

On the Wind-Storm Sect's square, hundreds of disciples stood. On a high platform accommodating several hundred people, the heads and elders of various sects sat in groups, chatting and laughing.

"Haha, three sect leaders arrived so early!" Yang Kaiji's face bore a self-satisfied expression as he ascended the platform and sat before Zheng Hongsheng and the others.

Yang Kaiji was particularly pleased, especially after hearing from Dan Sect disciples that Luo Tian had spent the entire night alchemizing. This confirmed that Luo Tian was merely a half-baked alchemist with no real talent.

The more Yang Kaiji thought, the more he felt his decision to agree was correct. Not only would it salvage his and his grandson's reputation, but he'd also gain the cauldron. And in front of so many influential sect leaders from the Eastern Lands, he'd let his grandson shine. A renowned alchemist would greatly benefit Yang Hongguang's future, and what was he relying on if not prestige? Otherwise, how could he have acted so boldly in the Wind-Storm Sect yesterday.

Zheng Hongsheng and the others saw Yang Kaiji's smug face and wanted to slap him, mocking him. But recalling Luo Tian’s alchemical skills, they weren’t sure, so they let Yang Kaiji gloat.

Not long after, five elders arrived with disciples, taking seats in the center. These five were esteemed alchemical masters of the Wind-Storm Sect—this competition's judges.

Zheng Xin, Cold Qiuchan, and Duan Xingchen stood behind their elders, waiting for Luo Tian and Yang Hongguang to arrive.

A quarter-hour later, Luo Tian's figure appeared in people’s sight.

Seeing Luo Tian, some bore expressions of clenched teeth. These were disciples from various sects who had endured the third soul-rending trial. Upon seeing Luo Tian and the same third trial as the one they faced, they thought of their own.

None of these disciples were exceptions; all radiated the aura of Bone-Devouring Peak, even stronger than ordinary Bone-Devouring Peak.

Luo Tian noticed the resentful glances and instinctively touched his nose, wondering when he had offended these people.

He sighed lightly, then wore a habitual smile, ascending the platform and bowing to the elders before standing still.

"Did I think you wouldn’t come?" A mocking voice echoed through the crowd as Yang Hongguang emerged from the throng.

Yang Hongguang respectfully bowed to the three sect leaders before turning to Luo Tian, speaking softly: "Luo Tian, dare you add another wager?"

"Oh?" Luo Tian looked at Yang Hongguang with interest.

"Your previous wager was between me and my grandfather. I want to bet against you alone!" Yang Hongguang's face bore a sinister expression.

"Speak, today I’ll cooperate with you!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his tone calm.

"If I win, I'll slap you three times; if I lose, you’ll slap me three times. Dare you accept?" Yang Hongguang's face darkened as he spoke.

"Good!" Luo Tian sighed lightly, responding calmly.

Upon hearing Luo Tian's agreement, Yang Hongguang’s face lit up with joy before he looked at Luo Tian and sneered: "Truly brave!"

"Ahem..." Before Luo Tian and Yang Hongguang could continue, a light cough echoed in the crowd, halting their confrontation.

"I’ll explain the rules of this competition!" Zheng Hongsheng stepped forward from his seat, standing between them and speaking softly.

"Based on the elders’ research, this competition consists of three items: first, identifying herbs; second, measuring the speed of refining medicinal liquid; third, comparing which elixir is superior!" Zheng Hongsheng announced the rules before declaring the competition's start.

Upon hearing Zheng Hongsheng’s rules, Yang Hongguang’s face lit up with joy, secretly thinking the competition was fair and even beneficial to him.

"Unfair!" Cold Hongcai and others murmured upon hearing the rules.

Just the first item had people doubting Luo Tian’s chances. Who could match the Dan Sect's expertise in identifying herbs?

But if Lu Kunpeng and other disciples of the Dan Sect heard this first rule, they would curse it as too harsh. In identifying herbs, Luo Tian could claim second place; who dared to claim first?

Yet the people present didn’t know Luo Tian’s terrifying ability to recognize herbs, so they pitied him.

"Alright, to save time, we’ll present three herbs for you to identify. Whoever correctly identifies all wins the first item!" One of the five judges spoke, half-closing his eyes as he placed three herbs before them.

Luo Tian and Yang Hongguang’s faces tensed as they approached the judges, awaiting the herbs.

As soon as they stood before the judges, three Wind-Storm Sect disciples brought forth three herbs, placing them before the two.

"Look!" The elder spoke, half-closing his eyes as he arranged the herbs before them.

"Look carefully! Bring paper and ink, write down the herb's name!" The elder instructed.

Luo Tian and Yang Hongguang each took out paper and ink, writing down the names of herbs they knew. They handed their answers to the elder.

After exchanging the answers among themselves, two judges unfolded the papers.

"Eight-Point Copper Snake Flower!" Both had written the same name.

"Unexpectedly, this rustic fellow actually recognized it!" Yang Hongguang’s face showed a hint of amusement, not overly concerned. Though Eight-Point Copper Snake Flower was rare, it was common for disciples of sects with some background to recognize it.

"Next!" The elder, half-closing his eyes, spoke lazily, wondering why Zheng Hongsheng had made these people judges for two children.

As the elder’s words ended, another herb was brought forth by a disciple.

A jade box opened, releasing a gentle breeze and faint thunderous sounds in Luo Tian and Yang Hongguang’s ears.

"A leaf?" Yang Hongguang's face showed confusion. He sensed the leaf was no ordinary thing, his gaze fixed on it with contemplation.

Luo Tian saw the leaf within the jade box, his lips subtly twitching. He glanced at Zheng Xin and his brothers standing behind Zheng Hongsheng, sighing inwardly.

"Ha!" The three brothers’ eyes showed a hint of amusement. Zheng Xin winked at Luo Tian.

"What a pity!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, taking out paper and ink to write the leaf’s name, handing it to the elder.

Seeing Luo Tian quickly complete the herb's name, the elder’s half-closed eyes opened slightly, glancing at Luo Tian.

Chapter 481: You're Wrong
Chapter 481: You're Wrong

The elder, seeing Luo Tian quickly write the herb's name, displayed disdain. He knew this was clearly cheating; no one could recognize this leaf at first glance.

In contrast, Yang Hongguang pondered for a moment before his face lit with brilliance. He gazed at the leaf in the jade box, took out paper and ink, and swiftly wrote its name before handing it to the elder.

After exchanging the answers among themselves, the judges unfolded the papers. Seeing both names, people were stunned at Luo Tian.

Yang Hongguang recognizing it was due to the Dan Sect's deep roots, but how did Luo Tian recognize it? People were puzzled. Even more so, Luo Tian's speed of recognition was faster than Yang Hongguang’s.

Luo Tian sighed inwardly, cursing Zheng's three brothers for their well-meaning but misguided actions. Now he was truly looked down upon.

"Third herb!" The elder sneered at Luo Tian.

"Hmph, that's all you can do? Using such methods!" Yang Hongguang’s face bore disdain. His confidence had grown stronger.

"Uh..." On the platform, Zheng Xin and his brothers saw people murmuring, realizing they might have done more harm than good to Luo Tian. Their eyes showed regret.

Under the scrutinizing gazes, a disciple brought forth the third herb, opening the jade box. A scent of blood filled Luo Tian and Yang Hongguang’s noses.

Before them stood a seemingly ordinary herb, causing both to frown slightly.

The five judges opened their eyes, gazing at the two with smiles.

"What is this?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows.

"This herb resembles Dragon Soul Grass, but why is the scent of blood so intense!"

"Dragon Soul Grass is rare and considered a treasure, but ordinary Dragon Soul Grass shouldn’t emit such a thick scent of blood!" Luo Tian was thoroughly puzzled.

"Rustic fellow, you don’t recognize Dragon Soul Grass!" Yang Hongguang’s face bore mockery. He wrote the name of Dragon Soul Grass on his paper, attributing the blood scent to its age.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, desperately recalling Dragon Soul Grass information. The records in the "Book of Herbs" swiftly passed through his mind.

"Could it be..." Luo Tian’s face lit with brilliance, his gaze deep as he stared at the root of Dragon Soul Grass.

"Show-off, but not this way!" Yang Hongguang’s disdain deepened, even mocking Luo Tian.

Luo Tian ignored Yang Hongguang's scornful gaze, his eyes smiling as he wrote the name from his mind onto the paper and handed it to the elder.

After the judges exchanged the papers again, their gazes at Luo Tian showed even more disdain.

"Finished! He’s lost the first round!" Zheng Xin and others saw the judges’ expressions, their eyes showing bitterness.

"Haha..." As both papers were unfolded, people looked at the answers. Dan Sect disciples laughed without restraint.

"Ten Thousand Dragon Emperor's Blood!"

"Haha, you don’t recognize it? Why not write 'Dragon Emperor’s Reverse Scale'!" A disciple laughed loudly, his voice mocking.

"Hmph!" Seeing Luo Tian’s embarrassment, Yang Hongguang felt much better, his resentment seemingly dissipating.

"The first item is won by Yang Hongguang!" The lead elder’s face showed impatience. He truly didn’t want to watch this competition anymore.

"Wait, elder!" Luo Tian’s voice rang clearly in the crowd.

The five judges displayed impatience, gazing at Luo Tian but not exploding. One elder spoke: "What do you have to say? Are you questioning our decision?"

"I do have something to say. Please let me explain before making a judgment!" Luo Tian’s face showed respect.

"What do you have to say? You don’t even recognize Dragon Soul Grass; what’s the point of continuing?" The elder, seeing Luo Tian's respectful demeanor, had some of his anger dissipated.

"Because this is indeed Dragon Emperor’s Blood!" Luo Tian's face showed confidence, his gaze sweeping over the elders.

"Hmph, arrogant!" The elder’s anger flared again upon hearing Luo Tian's words.

"I’m not being arrogant, but if you don’t give me a chance to explain, it would be unfair to me!" Luo Tian smiled, his tone calm but resolute.

The elders suppressed their anger and spoke coldly: "Fine, since you want to explain, we’ll give you a chance. I’d like to see how this young man explains it!"

"Truly self-inflicted humiliation!" Yang Hongguang mocked.

Luo Tian ignored the mocking gazes and took the Dragon Soul Grass in his hand, speaking aloud: "This herb resembles Dragon Soul Grass but emits a scent of blood. I believe everyone here has felt it!"

"Perhaps you’ll say this is a mutation due to its age. However, I can tell you that idea is completely wrong!"

"Though this herb’s appearance isn’t much different from ordinary Dragon Soul Grass, look at its root. It has ten segments, each representing a thousand years of life!"

"In other words, this herb you think is Dragon Soul Grass has lived ten thousand years! Tell me, what’s the maximum lifespan of Dragon Soul Grass? Correct, nine thousand years!"

Luo Tian's words echoed in the crowd. People looked at Dragon Soul Grass’s root, indeed seeing ten segments.

After Luo Tian spoke, before people could react, he extended a finger. A streak of golden-elemental energy flew from his fingertip and landed on Dragon Soul Grass’s root.

"Child!"

"Stop!" Exclamations of alarm came from the judges, their eyes filled with anger.

Though they shouted loudly, Luo Tian seemed to ignore them. The energy transformed into a sharp knife, slicing Dragon Soul Grass’s root. Dragon Soul Grass’s root broke under Luo Tian's energy blade.

"Roar..." But as the root broke, a dragon roar echoed in people’s ears, causing those standing to be astonished.

Under the stunned gazes, a drop of crimson blood fell from Dragon Soul Grass’s breakage point into a jade bottle Luo Tian had prepared.

Luo Tian sealed the bottle, and the dragon roar disappeared.

"Please judge whether this is indeed the legendary Ten Thousand Dragon Emperor’s Blood, Dragon God's Essence!" Luo Tian spoke calmly in the silent square.

Chapter 482: Flame Confrontation
Chapter 482: Flame Confrontation

People gazed in astonishment at Luo Tian standing respectfully. The Dan Sect disciples who had mocked him earlier could no longer speak.

Five Wind-Storm Sect elders displayed intense disbelief, gazing at the jade bottle in Luo Tian’s hand. Having spent years with herbs, they hadn’t expected this to be the legendary Dragon God's Essence!

"This..." Five elders felt their faces burning, especially seeing Luo Tian’s respectful demeanor. They wished to vanish into the ground.

Yang Kaiji's face finally showed concern. At this moment, he felt a bad premonition; perhaps his bet with Luo Tian wasn’t the right choice.

Yang Hongguang gazed at the jade bottle in Luo Tian’s hand, his eyes changing repeatedly. He muttered: "How is this possible!"

Everyone's gaze turned to Luo Tian, who had reversed the situation. Not only did he humiliate Yang’s grandfather and grandson, but also embarrassed the five judges.

Cold Qiuchan's lips curled slightly as she gazed at Luo Tian. She had believed from the start that Luo Tian wouldn’t lose, and he hadn’t disappointed her.

"The result doesn’t count; the first item is won by Luo Tian!" The lead elder, his face red, announced the result before slowly sitting down.

Yang Hongguang heard this and showed intense resentment, internally telling himself: "He just happened to know!"

"Can you tell us how many herbs you know?" The elder, no longer disdainful, spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian.

"About two million!" Luo Tian’s tone was calm, his face showing no emotion.

"Two... two million!"

"My heavens!"

"He’s boasting!" People looked at Luo Tian, who remained calm, with disbelief in their eyes.

"Impossible!" Yang Hongguang’s face showed disbelief, shouting: "You don’t believe he can recognize two million herbs!"

But after that, Yang Hongguang’s gaze fell. The result was decided; Luo Tian had no need to lie.

Under people's amazement, Zheng Hongsheng happily approached the platform and spoke: "Second item, do you need preparation?"

Luo Tian and Yang Hongguang both shook their heads. There had been no consumption, so they naturally didn’t need rest.

Zheng Hongsheng turned around and nodded to the five elders still in a daze: "Then let’s begin the second item!"

"Uh..." The lead elder regained his senses, no longer lazy. He spoke softly: "Second item, begin!"

As the elder’s words ended, two Wind-Storm Sect disciples approached Luo Tian and Yang Hongguang. From their storage bags, they took out two identical alchemical cauldrons and placed them before the two.

"I can’t lose this round!" Yang Hongguang adjusted his mindset, recalling his secret weapon. His face showed confidence again.

The five judges checked the cauldrons before taking out three portions of herbs and speaking: "Each gets three portions. The one who finishes faster wins!"

"One hundred!" Luo Tian’s spiritual sense quickly discerned the number of herbs in each portion.

"Nothing to object, let’s begin!" The elder announced the competition's start.

As the elder’s words ended, Luo Tian and Yang Hongguang instantly appeared beside their cauldrons. Almost simultaneously, they placed their hands on the fire mouths of the cauldrons. Flames surged out, rushing into the cauldrons with a humming sound.

Luo Tian’s face showed a hint of smile. The first herb appeared in his hand, thrown into the cauldron. Flames enveloped it and began to refine.

"Hmph... rustic fellow!" Yang Hongguang sneered, his hands forming blurs as he threw herbs into the cauldron.

"Cloud-Flow Triple!" Duan Yuyan’s face showed shock, speaking softly.

"Is that impressive?" Zheng Xin displayed interest, gazing at Yang Hongguang’s hands moving like flowing clouds.

"It's impressive! This is a technique of Yang Kaiji, the sect elder. I didn’t expect Yang Hongguang to have mastered it and achieved mastery in the third layer. Third layer, Luo Tian faces trouble in this second item!" Duan Yuyan spoke softly.

The five judges, seeing Yang Hongguang use such an advanced alchemical technique, had their eyes flicker with admiration. They secretly marveled at how this day hadn’t been in vain.

"Fifty herbs!" Yang Hongguang’s face bore a triumphant expression, having refined fifty herbs was already rare.

"Alright, I’ll take this seriously; otherwise, I might lose!" Luo Tian smiled, his hands forming blurs.

The Thousand-Page Brushing Technique—Luo Tian hadn’t practiced diligently recently, but after entering the Nascent Soul stage, his speed was several times faster than in the Bone-Devouring stage.

"Five hundred..." People were stunned, watching Luo Tian’s blurs. Some carefully counted the hand shadows of both Luo Tian and Yang Hongguang.

"Yang Hongguang has three hundred and fifty, but Luo Tian has five hundred!" People gazed at Luo Tian in amazement. Now they no longer viewed Luo Tian as a half-baked alchemist.

Luo Tian’s eyes showed confidence. He had quickly thrown one hundred herbs into the cauldron, separating them with his refined Nascent Soul spiritual sense. Flames also divided into one hundred portions.

"Refining a hundred herbs at once? He’s mad!" The five judges, still recovering from Luo Tian's previous technique, were even more stunned by his action.

Zheng Xin and others showed excitement on their faces. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so extraordinary in both talent and alchemy.

"Can't lose this way!" Yang Hongguang, seeing Luo Tian's actions, felt a tremor.

"Looks like I have to use it early!" Yang Hongguang thought, a streak of emerald-green flame suddenly bursting from his hand. It quickly spread over fifty herbs.

"Despicable!"

"Disgraceful!" Zheng Xin and his brothers couldn’t help but curse.

"Bamboo Crystalline Luminous Flame!" The five judges widened their eyes, standing up to gaze at the emerald-green flame in Yang Hongguang’s hand.

Yang Kaiji's face showed a bitter smile. He hadn’t expected his grandson, Yang Hongguang, to be forced to use the Bamboo Crystalline Luminous Flame by a peer.

This flame was originally borrowed from Yang Kaiji to prepare for emergencies, but he hadn’t expected it to be used so early in the second round.

Chapter 483: A Tie
Chapter 483: A Tie

The emerald-green flame surged into the cauldron, instantly raising its temperature. The herbs inside the cauldron transformed into fifty portions of medicinal liquid, flowing smoothly under Yang Hongguang’s spiritual sense.

A faint fragrance of herbs drifted from Yang Hongguang's cauldron, spreading across the square and causing people to be stunned.

"Indeed, no wonder it's one of the Dan Sect’s three ancestral flames. The speed at which it refines herbs is truly terrifying!" The five judges displayed admiration, murmuring among themselves.

"Yang Kaiji, you really are shameless! Using the Bamboo Crystalline Luminous Flame on your grandson!" Zheng Hongsheng and Cold Hongcai spoke softly, their faces showing faint mockery.

"There's no rule against using the Bamboo Crystalline Luminous Flame, is there?" Yang Kaiji sneered, gazing at Luo Tian.

In Yang Kaiji’s view, the Bamboo Crystalline Luminous Flame was irreplaceable. Luo Tian's bronze cauldron must be obtained; if he gained Luo Tian’s bronze cauldron, sacrificing a bit of his reputation was worth it.

Luo Tian sensed the change in Yang Kaiji’s cauldron and his face turned solemn. His five-element spiritual energy subtly circulated, using the mutual generation of elements to strengthen his flame.

"Buzz..." The cauldron before Luo Tian emitted a humming sound, drawing everyone's attention.

"Five-element mutual generation?" People’s eyes brightened as they gazed at Luo Tian, secretly marveling at his extraordinary constitution. As the five elements generated each other, a fragrance of herbs gradually flowed from Luo Tian’s cauldron, even more intense than Yang Hongguang's.

"Damn! If this continues, even with the Bamboo Crystalline Luminous Flame, I’ll find it hard to beat him. His spiritual sense is what? It’s free?" Yang Hongguang felt bitter, his face showing madness. Soon after, fifty herbs were completely refined into medicinal liquid by Yang Hongguang.

Yang Hongguang didn’t delay, quickly placing the remaining fifty herbs into the cauldron and refining them frantically.

"Who do you think will finish first?" One judge asked, his face showing interest. The other judges no longer looked lazy but gazed at Luo Tian and Yang Hongguang.

They hadn’t expected to be assigned as judges for such a competition, but they had encountered the Bamboo Crystalline Luminous Flame, which was enough to make them envious. Just this one item made the trip worthwhile, especially with witnessing both’s extraordinary alchemical techniques.

"I think Yang's boy will win. He has the Bamboo Crystalline Luminous Flame, and his refining speed is much faster. Luo Tian’s boy isn’t simple, but he has a clear weakness in his flame!" One elder judge spoke.

"I don’t think so. Luo Tian refined a hundred portions at once, and time should be enough to compensate for the flame’s weakness. Plus, his five-element mutual generation flame has narrowed the gap," another elder judge spoke.

Not only did the five judges discuss this, but others also murmured, watching the two with serious faces waiting for their results.

After a quarter-hour, what people waited for was both Luo Tian and Yang Hongguang opening their eyes simultaneously, their gazes filled with brilliance.

They exchanged glances, a look of surprise flashing in their eyes before they both opened the cauldrons. Intense herbal fragrance filled the cauldrons.

"Go..." Luo Tian roared, and a hundred portions of medicinal liquid flew into the jade bottles prepared beforehand.

At the same time, Yang Hongguang’s jade bottle also received medicinal liquid.

"A tie!" The five judges displayed strange expressions, gazing at both’s actions done simultaneously.

Yang Hongguang's face turned completely grim. He had used the Bamboo Crystalline Luminous Flame but still hadn’t beaten Luo Tian, ending in a tie. This made Yang Hongguang deeply resentful.

Even more unsettling for Yang Hongguang was that if this round ended in a tie, even if he won the next, it would be one to one. He had now fallen into a passive position.

Yang Kaiji’s face changed slightly. Naturally, he understood the situation. Grandfather and grandson exchanged glances from afar, their hearts anxious. They had thought this was a sure win, but now it had turned to the disadvantage.

Zheng Hongsheng saw this and clearly felt good. For him, a tie was the best scenario—no harm to relations or face. As for the third item, Zheng Hongsheng had no hope of Luo Tian winning; after all, Yang Hongguang was well-known in the Eastern Lands.

"Haha... Yuyan, I told you it would be fine. With Luo Tian’s help, anything is easy! Now we can safely get married!" Zheng Xin rubbed his hands and approached Duan Yuyan and Cold Qiuchan.

"I’m confused why Luo Tian didn’t use the Three Thousand Burning Flames to win earlier, but instead chose a tie," Duan Yuyan showed some confusion.

They knew that Luo Tian had the Three Thousand Burning Flames within him. This was borrowed from Duan Yuyan yesterday, who had moved part of it to help Luo Tian. After all, the Three Thousand Burning Flames were completely refined by Duan Yuyan.

"You still don’t understand him. He’s more proud than anyone else. Earlier, when Zheng Xin used the Jade Crystalline Luminous Flame as the first item’s test, it made him feel his victory wasn’t so deserved!"
