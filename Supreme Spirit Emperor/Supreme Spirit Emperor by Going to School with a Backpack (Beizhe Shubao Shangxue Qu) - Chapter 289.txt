“Divine Clan's Forbidden Technique!” The three men felt a chill in their hearts as they witnessed the battle within the grey mist, a golden light streaking like a meteor toward Ming Xiuyan with full force.

“Seems we have no choice but to act,” Luo Tian sighed, sitting cross-legged in the void beneath him.

Chapter 1206: Meng Lingyun Arrives ()

Beneath the Four Sacred Star Domains, violent fluctuations spread across the region, shattering stars and clashing among dozens of warriors. Epoch power surged wildly, dimming the starry sky.

Within the grey mist, a golden light illuminated the cosmos, revealing an aged figure with resolute determination. His overwhelming aura surged toward Ming Xiuyan, clad in grey robes.

“I see the depth of our Divine Clan’s heritage,” Sun Shengtian’s face bore sorrow as he watched the elder charge. He knew their heritage could no longer withstand this, and only a forbidden technique might wound Ming Xiuyan.

“Ultimate Ascension—Divine Clan’s Forbidden Technique?” Ming Xiuyan sneered, his blood roiling as grey rune dragons erupted from his hands, howling toward the Divine Clan’s elder.

Under Sun Shengtian and Diaoyu Shan’s gaze, the grey dragons disintegrated under the elder’s desperate strike, dissolving into wisps of ash.

“Though you were once mighty, now you are but stepping stones!” Ming Xiuyan showed no surprise as the dragons crumbled. He leapt into the void, appearing before the elder in an instant, colliding with him.

Like two continents clashing, a thunderous explosion erupted between them. The elder’s face bore resolve as he was gradually consumed by the blast, his eyes filled with regret.

Ming Xiuyan emerged from the explosion, a sovereign among stars, his gaze fierce as he turned to observe other battles. His eyes fell upon Ming Yongzhi, who had forged a body but fallen to half-epoch strength.

“Die!” Sun Shengtian and Diaoyu Shan, spotting Ming Yongzhi’s body, surged toward him with merciless intent.

Ming Yongzhi, now no match for them, turned pale with fear as they closed in.

“Third Brother, save me!” Ming Yongzhi roared, desperation in his voice.

Before his words faded, Ming Xiuyan materialized beside him, a crushing pressure forcing Sun Shengtian and Diaoyu Shan to halt.

“You are the ones who will perish!” Ming Xiuyan pointed, a thick finger凝聚, crushing toward them.

“Crack…” Before the finger struck, cracks splintered across their bodies, their faces contorting.

Yet Luo Tian remained seated in the void, eyes closed as if meditating.

“Done,” Sun Shengtian and Diaoyu Shan sighed in unison, knowing their fate was sealed before an epoch-level powerhouse.

The thick finger loomed over them, blood spilling from their bodies.

“Hum…” Suddenly, emerald light flared in the chaotic void, a jade coffin soaring forth and striking the finger.

“Meng Lingyun! Again!” Ming Xiuyan’s face turned cold, recognizing the coffin.

“Meng Lingyun!” The battlefield stilled as people from the Eight Domains felt a surge of hope. Yet, upon seeing Meng Lingyun’s arrival via the jade coffin, unease gripped them.

Long Xinyuan and Sun Chengyang’s aged faces glistened with sweat as they stared at the resounding coffin, exchanging glances before retreating Ming Haoyan’s assault to discern Meng Lingyun’s current state.

“Expect disappointment,” Ming Haoyan smiled, neither stopping them nor continuing his attack, his gaze fixed on the coffin.

Others too默契ly halted their assaults; the wild fluctuations gradually subsided, all eyes turning to the hovering jade coffin.

“Hum…” The lid lifted, vitality spreading as wounded Eight Domain elders’ wounds healed.

As the elders gazed in awe, Meng Lingyun and the Immortal Marvel Tree emerged. Upon seeing Meng Lingyun’s state, their hearts dropped.

“Rebellious disciple!” Meng Lingyun opened his eyes, exuding oppressive authority toward Ming Haoyan.

“Ah, Master!” Ming Haoyan smiled, locking eyes with Meng Lingyun, lightning flashing.

“Unexpectedly, you still live. What strength do you possess now? Have you lingered this long in vain? Today, I shall send you to your final rest!” Ming Haoyan clenched his fists, voice devoid of reverence.

“Even in my残躯, I shall斩 you!” Meng Lingyun wasted no words, his hands emitting green light into the Immortal Marvel Tree.

“Crash…” As the tree’s branches rustled, it erupted with vitality, green light scattering and obscuring sight.

In an instant, the tree sprouted branches that pierced Meng Lingyun’s half-body, gradually coalescing into a pair of legs, as if reborn, restoring his flesh.

“Used Immortal Divine Herb to forge legs?” Ming Haoyan’s face shifted at Meng Lingyun’s restored body.

A formidable pressure swept over the crowd, even epoch-level elders struggling to endure its might.

“Regrettable,” Long Xinyuan and Sun Chengyang sighed, watching Meng Lingyun. They had hoped his arrival would turn the tide, but instead, they faced a half-body and a残魂.

Though Meng Lingyun was powerful, he paled in comparison to his former self. Not even an epoch master, let alone his prime.

“Wasted the Immortal Divine Herb. I’ll kill you and extract its essence!” Ming Haoyan’s eyes gleamed coldly, moving to attack Meng Lingyun. He knew Meng Lingyun posed a greater threat than Long Xinyuan and Sun Chengyang, for he had once been an epoch master.

“Master, focus on killing these two elders; I’ll handle this old man!” Ming Xiuyan addressed Ming Haoyan, eyes on Meng Lingyun.

“Be cautious; you know his strength. Though a残躯, don’t underestimate him,” Ming Haoyan warned before darting toward Long Xinyuan and Sun Chengyang, his attacks fiercer.

“Your luck ran out before; today it won’t,” Ming Xiuyan snarled, his epoch-level aura surging as he rushed toward Meng Lingyun.

“Purge the clan!” Meng Lingyun coldly uttered, his body radiating terrifying authority as he charged.

“Crack…” In an instant, the two clashed. Ming Xiuyan, clad in grey robes, was hurled backward, blood spewing from his mouth.

“Rebellious disciple! Still so foolish to clash with me!” Meng Lingyun sneered, stepping into the void toward Ming Xiuyan.

“Mighty! Truly an epoch master!” The crowd felt Meng Lingyun’s formidable flesh, their despair reigniting.

Though weakened, his half-body was beyond most to withstand. If not for its fragmentary state, a single epoch master’s flesh would have crushed them all.

“Old fool!” Ming Xiuyan spat blood, his face twisted with fury as Meng Lingyun approached.

“Unyielding Death King!” Ming Xiuyan roared, standing in the void, awaiting Meng Lingyun’s arrival.

“Trash!” Meng Lingyun ignored him, his body radiating invincibility as he launched a green fist toward Ming Xiuyan.

“Crack…” Thunderous lightning flared within the grey aura, but Ming Xiuyan’s reinforced body still met its end, his punch shattering into blood mist.

“Mighty! Truly an epoch master! Even in this state, he is invincible!” Diaoyu Shan and Sun Chengyang marveled, gazing at Meng Lingyun standing in the grey mist. His invincible aura was beyond ordinary grasp, a true epoch master’s presence.

Chapter 1207: Inevitable ()

Beneath the Four Sacred Star Domains, Luo Tian sat cross-legged in the void, expressionless as if forgetting he was amidst battle.

Meanwhile, Meng Lingyun’s might surged as Ming Xiuyan retreated before him. In mere moments, they clashed dozens of times; yet Ming Xiuyan faltered, nearly torn apart, his body riddled with wounds and a sunken chest.

In contrast, others’ battles were dire; their strength waned over time, some elders succumbing to Ming Domain’s forces.

Including Long Xinyuan and Sun Chengyang, their life essence dwindled, strength waning.

At this moment, Luo Tian’s grey soul had already left his body, entering the formidable flesh of Zhongli Tian, another reincarnation body.

Luo Tian was fortunate; perhaps due to their shared reincarnation bodies, Zhongli Tian’s flesh did not reject his soul.

The grey soul instantly entered Zhongli Tian’s mind, but the latter’s mind was barren, devoid of life.

“Indeed, an epoch master’s prowess; Zhongli Tian前辈 has perished, leaving no soul behind. Yet his flesh remains intact!” Luo Tian mused, then the grey soul began to seize control of the mind.

Within Zhongli Tian’s flesh, Luo Tian lost track of time. He resolved to master this body, else he’d be a burden in the coming battles. They fought for the Eight Domains’ survival; how could he not cherish his life?

Time passed slowly as Luo Tian infiltrated Zhongli Tian’s flesh. Though the body lacked a soul, its epoch-level aura slowed his takeover.

Though slow, no dire incidents occurred, filling Luo Tian with relief.

As Luo Tian infiltrated Zhongli Tian’s flesh, Meng Lingyun and others clashed with the Ming Domain at their peak.

Ming Xiuyan, grim-faced, watched Meng Lingyun charge again. His previous clash had left him severely wounded; even an epoch-level warrior would have perished.

“Where do you flee?” Meng Lingyun, like a sovereign, sealed Ming Xiuyan’s escape, his hand striking Ming Xiuyan’s chest.

“Crack…” A thunderous sound echoed as Ming Xiuyan’s body shattered.

“No rebirth!” Meng Lingyun’s hands glowed green, a life-giving yet world-destroying aura sweeping toward Ming Xiuyan’s mist.

“Ah…” A惨叫 echoed through the stars as Ming Xiuyan’s soul was consumed, his cries of agony.

Meanwhile, Ming Yongzhi, fallen to half-epoch strength, was slain by Sun Chengyang and Diaoyu Shan.

After Ming Yongzhi, Ming Xiuyan too was killed by Meng Lingyun. With two of the Nine Sacred Ming Domain warriors fallen, the most uplifting news was Ming Xiuyan’s death—inflicting a grievous wound. The Nine Sacred warriors had only three epoch-level members; now, only the second and fourth remained.

“Ah…” As Sun Chengyang and Diaoyu Shan rejoiced, four deafening roars echoed, drawing their attention back to the battlefield.

Four streaks of light rose—Starfield Domain, Chaos Domain, and four epoch-level elders from the Divine Clan. Their overwhelming auras surged toward the Ming Domain’s fourth.

“Another desperate tactic!” Sun Chengyang and Diaoyu Shan felt a tremor, knowing four more elders would perish.

The four streaks collided with the Ming Domain’s fourth, a thunderous explosion shaking heaven and earth. The elders’ desperate attacks succeeded; the Ming Domain’s fourth was annihilated, leaving nothing behind.

“Everyone, fight with desperation! Only thus can we kill them. If the battle drags on, our strength wanes, and hope fades!” The Abyssal Ghost貂 Clan’s elder, his aura purple, surged toward the Ming Domain’s second, Ming Zhenyan.

“Tian Shen Dao Ji Tian…炼星术…” Hearing the elder’s words, others围攻 Ming Zhenyan nodded, resolve flashing in their eyes. They were already doomed; if Ming Zhenyan lived, the Eight Domains would have no hope.

Another explosion erupted, five elders burning their lives away, perishing in sight.

A tragic, harrowing atmosphere spread through the stars, filling remaining elders with resolve.

“Elders have departed; now it’s our turn!” Other elders ignored Ming Zhenyan’s fate, their auras surging.

“Meng Lingyun, no time for nostalgia. If possible, I’d fight you again. Take these three and flee; if we fail to kill them, it’s up to you!” Long Xinyuan and Sun Chengyang, seeing brothers fall, smiled bitterly, their auras rising as they charged toward Ming Haoyan.

“Rest assured, I won’t live alone; I’ll kill them all!” Meng Lingyun sighed, an epoch master’s solitude deepening as he watched friends fall.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” Thunderous sounds echoed, shaking the Four Sacred Star Domains.

Those observing their clan’s elders turned pale as they noticed their soul-lanterns or life-threads crumbling at a terrifying speed.

“Elders have perished!” A cry echoed through the Eight Domains, all faces grim. With elders gone, they faced a dire crisis.

“Boom!” In the Divine Clan’s sacred mountain and the Beast Domain’s holy city, two sects’ people stared in disbelief as their elders’ soul-lanterns extinguished. Their sect’s greatest secret, an epoch-level elder, had fallen—unthinkable for the two sects.

The Four Sacred Star Domains, under the elders’ desperate efforts, resembled an apocalypse, its stars annihilated.

A green jade coffin floated at the domain’s edge, its aura repeatedly colliding with it.

The explosions lasted half a day before ceasing. The coffin’s lid lifted, revealing Meng Lingyun in the starry void—though “void” was no longer apt, as the domain had been obliterated.

“Is it over?” Diaoyu Shan and Sun Chengyang, faces grim, gazed at the vacuum-like domain. Having lived so long, they’d never seen such a battle erase an entire star domain. Such power was only achievable by epoch masters.

“If I were at my peak, I could’ve done this,” Meng Lingyun sighed, his eyes filled with nostalgia and loneliness.

“Where is Luo Tian? Since earlier, he’s been like a soulless man; such commotion hasn’t stirred him?” Diaoyu Shan looked worried, whispering.

“Hmm…” Meng Lingyun then turned his gaze to Luo Tian, his eyes flashing before turning puzzled.

“Not yet over!” As Diaoyu Shan and Sun Chengyang sighed in relief, observing Luo Tian’s state, Meng Lingyun’s face shifted slightly, his gaze on the surging grey mist, eyes filled with concern.

“Indeed, it’s not over. You think such an attack could kill us? How naive!” A sinister voice echoed within the grey mist.

“Hum…” In a hum, two battered figures appeared in Meng Lingyun’s sight, their bodies riddled with scars. One was pale, having reborn through blood.

“Ming Haoyan, Ming Zhenyan!” Meng Lingyun spoke softly, a green branch in his hand, his gaze deepening.

“Still alive?” Diaoyu Shan and Sun Chengyang gasped, their aged faces trembling. They couldn’t believe the elders’ strongest strike hadn’t killed them; such strength was terrifying.

“Words, if we were dead, would we be worthy of being an epoch master’s disciples?” Ming Haoyan panted, his aura chaotic. Though he spoke lightly, surviving the earlier chaos must have cost him greatly.

“Still couldn’t avoid it… fate’s battle!” Meng Lingyun approached Ming Haoyan and Ming Zhenyan, his voice icy.

Chapter 1208: Taking Over the Body ()

Within the swirling grey mist of the Four Sacred Star Domains, Meng Lingyun stood resolute, his gaze piercing as he faced Ming Haoyan and Ming Zhenyan a thousand paces away, his face brimming with killing intent.

“Indeed, it’s time to settle this. I failed to kill you before; now I have the chance!” Ming Haoyan and Ming Zhenyan’s auras were no less formidable, though wounded. Ming Haoyan still possessed epoch-level strength, the strongest in the Eight Domains.

“Sovereign of Heaven and Earth!” Knowing their threat, Meng Lingyun unleashed his martial art, a technique he’d created upon becoming an epoch master.

A green shadow materialized from his hands, a sword of destruction forming. Instead of sending the shadow to attack, Meng Lingyun entered it himself, embodying a sovereign wielding a sword to slay both heaven and hell.

“Still the same old tricks!” Ming Haoyan’s face turned cold, but his mind was wary. From the start, he knew Meng Lingyun posed a greater threat than Long Xinyuan and Sun Chengyang.

“Zhenyan, I need your help to regain my prime!” Ming Haoyan addressed Ming Zhenyan beside him, his voice authoritative.

“Fine,” Ming Zhenyan’s face shifted slightly before standing behind Ming Haoyan. He knew his epoch-level strength had fallen to half-epoch, making him no match for Meng Lingyun. Ming Xiuyan’s fate was proof of that.

“Nine Dark Truths Incantation!” Ming Zhenyan’s eyes flashed with cruelty, spitting blood that formed nine strange ancient characters. Even Meng Lingyun didn’t recognize their meaning, but the characters radiated odd energy, swirling above Ming Haoyan and Ming Zhenyan, scattering red light.

“You… are not human!” Meng Lingyun’s eyes flashed as he watched the characters transform into nine dragons in the grey mist, his face showing shock.

“Finally noticed?” Ming Haoyan sneered, inhaling the nine dragons into his mouth. His aura surged instantly, wounds mending in an instant. The nine dragons circled him.

“Ancestral Clan of the Ancient Era! How did you emerge?” Meng Lingyun’s eyes darkened, staring at Ming Haoyan, his mind in turmoil.

“Rest easy; our clan hasn’t fully emerged yet. We were merely left behind as a backup in the Eight Domains!”

“But now, after this battle, we shall fully emerge. The seal set by the Sky-Devouring Master was formidable; even my current strength can’t break it!”

“Yet after years, I’ve found a solution. I’ve completed half of it. If I kill you and obtain the Epoch Scripture, I’ll complete it!” At this point, Ming Haoyan revealed his plan without hesitation.

“Ah, so your claim of entering the Immortal Realm was a ruse. Your true goal was to break the seal between the Ancestral Clan and the Eight Domains!” Meng Lingyun’s mind trembled.

The Ancestral Clan was one of the Ancient Era’s ruling clans, sealed within the Tenth Domain by the Sky-Devouring Master. Their strength was undeniable; though years had passed without knowing the Tenth Domain’s state, Ming Haoyan alone could crush the Eight Domains.

“Kill!” Meng Lingyun’s mind raced, urgency gripping him. If not for his disciples, their cultivation speed wouldn’t have been so fast; the plan wouldn’t have advanced this quickly. He felt guiltier now.

Holding his sword of destruction, he transformed into a green light, attacking Ming Haoyan. The green blade severed space and the Dao, as if cutting through all existence, its radiant light slicing toward Ming Yongzhi.

“Now you still use the epoch master’s authority? This era doesn’t belong to you. Once I obtain the Epoch Scripture and become an epoch master, all ancient clans will kneel beneath me. Achieve immortality, true eternal life!” Ming Haoyan’s hands moved swiftly, bloodied heads flying from his grasp—ancient swords forged by the Nine Ming Domain disciples.

“Hum…” The nine swords, under Ming Haoyan’s control, assembled into a single blood-red scythe, radiating cold, merciless energy.

Faced with Meng Lingyun’s world-shattering sword light, Ming Haoyan remained calm, gripping the scythe and attacking Meng Lingyun.

A master and disciple, after countless years, now faced each other in death, neither holding back. Their techniques were unparalleled, shaking the Eight Domains.

“Again!” The Eight Domains’ sects heard the thunderous sound, their faces shocked. They guessed who had emerged to resist the Ming Domain.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian faced a deadly challenge. He had fully occupied Zhongli Tian’s body but halted at the golden sword suspended in his丹田.

“This is the longsword that Zhongli Tian前辈 used to slay the蛮族首领!” Luo Tian recognized it instantly. The golden sword bore the blood of the蛮族首领, dried but still radiating divine power, with a faint roar echoing in Zhongli Tian’s丹田.

“Should I cleanse the blood?” Luo Tian felt the sword’s intent, his mind conflicted.

A weapon that could withstand an epoch-level蛮族首领—its blood still oppressed Luo Tian’s soul. Now, as a soul alone, erasing the blood would take time.

“Never mind; I’ve already mastered most of this body. My combat power shouldn’t be weak. No more delays!” Luo Tian muttered, allocating part of his soul to attach to the golden sword, transforming it into Dao energy to erode the blood while driving Zhongli Tian’s body from his own.

Under the starry void, Meng Lingyun clashed with Ming Haoyan dozens of times in a short while. Both sustained injuries, but Meng Lingyun’s strength was due to special methods; though overwhelming against half-epoch warriors, Ming Haoyan surged with vitality, unafraid of Meng Lingyun and even gaining the upper hand.

Within the “Sovereign of Heaven and Earth” illusion, Meng Lingyun’s face was grim, blood trickling from his mouth. His body glowed green, but the sovereign’s illusion dimmed.

“No hope?” Diaoyu Shan and Sun Chengyang sighed, realizing even Meng Lingyun couldn’t withstand Ming Haoyan’s assault. Though not yet defeated, it was only a matter of time.

“You’re so weak! I’m disappointed!” Ming Haoyan’s eyes gleamed with satisfaction. A master of the epoch had been killed by him—what a feat! No matter the method, he was dead. This had never happened before in history.

“Don’t worry; even if I die, you won’t live long either! You still underestimate my methods!” Meng Lingyun’s eyes flashed resolve, his hands glowing green as he spoke.

“Hum…” As Meng Lingyun’s hands glowed, a blinding light rose behind Diaoyu Shan and Sun Chengyang, as if an ancient primordial beast had awakened. Its aura alone made them gasp for breath.

“Another secret weapon?” Ming Haoyan frowned, gazing behind them, his mind wary.

“It’s Luo Tian!” Ming Zhenyan’s voice echoed, confusion in his tone—how could Luo Tian still have tricks?

At this moment, Ming Zhenyan’s face was pale, his body restored to its aged form. He’d expended much energy helping Ming Haoyan recover.

“Luo Tian!” Diaoyu Shan and Sun Chengyang’s eyes flickered, their minds unable to connect such overwhelming aura with Luo Tian.

Light surged, strange phenomena arose. The jade coffin glowed golden again, illuminating the chaotic stars. A body like molten gold emerged from the coffin, appearing before them.

“Who is this? Where’s Luo Tian?” Everyone was stunned, even Meng Lingyun bewildered. How could his sealed jade coffin hold such a presence?

“Reincarnation Body!” The seasoned elders recognized the body’s origin.

“A reincarnation body of epoch-level strength!” Seeing it, all were shocked, recalling the Reincarnation Body’s terrifying combat power. An epoch-level body could rival an epoch master, escaping or even clashing with one.

The pressure was immense; the body seemed to break free from constraints, sitting in the void. Its overwhelming aura created a storm, knocking Diaoyu Shan and Sun Chengyang back a hundred paces.

“This is an epoch master’s aura! This body was already fully developed! Perhaps even at the threshold of becoming an epoch master!” Meng Lingyun’s eyes gleamed, observing Zhongli Tian.

Under everyone’s gaze, Zhongli Tian’s body slowly opened its eyes, and Meng Lingyun’s face lit with understanding.

“It’s Luo Tian; he has taken over this body!” Meng Lingyun spoke, his voice filled with joy. In those clear eyes, he saw Luo Tian’s presence.

“Elders, my apologies for being late!” A deep voice echoed from Zhongli Tian’s body, his authoritative gaze sweeping around, his killing intent radiating from his formidable flesh.

Chapter 1209: The Terrifying Reincarnation Body ()

“Crack… crack…” A series of cracks echoed from Zhongli Tian’s body as Luo Tian controlled it, a smile on his face. He clenched his fists, whispering: “Feeling powerful is great!”

Luo Tian sighed inwardly; never had he felt so mighty, looking down on all. Even against Ming Haoyan, his battle spirit was fierce.

“Just controlling the body—still nothing against me!” Ming Haoyan sneered, his voice cold but his mind wary.

“Is that so?” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with two beams of divine light, his feet pressing into the void. Divine patterns spread beneath him, radiating outward. His formidable body instantly pierced space, appearing before Ming Haoyan in an instant. A simple punch struck toward him—not because he lacked the power to use sacred energy, but this body had no sacred or epoch strength.

Yet that simple punch carried overwhelming might. In an instant, it struck Ming Haoyan’s front.

“Move!” Ming Haoyan doubted, his fist infused with epoch power clashing against Luo Tian’s.

Next moment, both men exploded backward, becoming meteors flying thousands of paces.

But their states were starkly different: Ming Haoyan’s entire arm exploded, while Luo Tian remained unscathed.

“Opportunity!” Meng Lingyun and others smiled slightly, watching Luo Tian standing in the grey mist.

“Luo Tian, fight him up close! He can’t withstand us two!” Meng Lingyun urged, his body darting toward Ming Haoyan again. With a half-epoch master’s body, though incomplete, he was confident his flesh wouldn’t be weaker than Zhongli Tian. In close combat, Ming Haoyan would surely perish.

“With this body, I’m already invincible!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness. He felt no threat from anything but epoch treasures or true epoch masters.

“I won’t give you another chance!” Ming Haoyan’s eyes flashed with coldness, his shattered arm instantly restored. He wielded a blood-red scythe, attacking the two alone.

“Ming Flame!” Ming Haoyan’s hands moved, grey flames erupting from his body, merging into the mist. The flames instantly covered the void.

Tremendous heat surged, becoming a vast sea of fire, sweeping toward Luo Tian and Meng Lingyun.

“Quickly retreat!” Meng Lingyun’s eyes flashed, grabbing Diaoyu Shan and Sun Chengyang to escape the fire. He felt a dire threat within the intense heat.

The grey flames, like threads of mist, wrapped around Luo Tian and Meng Lingyun, trapping them.

“You don’t know where your half-body went? I’ll tell you: it was refined into fuel for this flame!” Ming Haoyan sneered. Such flames could kill even an epoch-level warrior. Even if Luo Tian and Meng Lingyun were strong, time would be their undoing.

Luo Tian’s face darkened; the terrifying heat seemed to burn his soul, protected by Zhongli Tian’s unparalleled flesh.
