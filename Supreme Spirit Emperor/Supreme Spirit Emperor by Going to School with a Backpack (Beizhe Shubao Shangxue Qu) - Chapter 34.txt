“Excuse me, but I cannot agree to this!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully to Bai Yuqin.

Long Jian, as a man, naturally understood what Luo Tian was thinking. His eyes gleamed with approval, and he stopped Bai Yuqin from continuing to persuade Luo Tian. Smiling, he said, “Let’s go out and see my old brothers—they’ve been terribly worried. Oh, and your friends are still searching for you in the Great An Forest. I fear if I move them here, they might be frightened by those outside. So I’ve let them continue searching in the Great An Forest.”

Hearing that Dong Sansi and the others were still searching for him in the Great An Forest, Luo Tian felt a warmth in his heart. He bowed respectfully to Long Jian: “Thank you, elder!”

“Ah… since you’re now one with my son! Don’t be so formal—call me Long Uncle!” Long Jian chuckled, clearly in high spirits.

As they spoke, the three of them stepped outside the cave. The dozens of fierce beasts waiting impatiently saw Luo Tian leaping out lively and joyfully, their excitement palpable.

Chapter 161: Departing the Great An Forest

Chapter 161: Departing the Great An Forest

At this moment, Luo Tian saw numerous powerful fierce beasts. Though he had prepared himself mentally, he was still awestruck, a bitter smile on his face: “I’ve troubled the elders!”

“Boy, you’ve grown stronger!” A mountain-like black ape extended a small finger and lightly patted Luo Tian’s shoulder.

Though Luo Tian had become stronger, he still felt a surge of qi, his face faintly flushed.

“Old Eight! Don’t bully the kid!” Bai Yuqin whispered, her gaze toward Luo Tian softening.

Hearing Bai Yuqin’s reprimand, the black ape sighed helplessly and pounded his chest, his face innocent. He clearly hadn’t used much strength!

The other fierce beasts chuckled silently at the black ape’s misfortune, though they controlled themselves. Their laughter still echoed far and wide, making Luo Tian’s ears ache. He then thanked his lucky stars he hadn’t accepted Bai Yuqin’s offer to stay in the Great An Forest—this decision had been wise.

Spending days with these ancestors, he might have gone mad.

“Excuse me, I have urgent matters to attend to. I won’t trouble the elders any longer!” Luo Tian suddenly remembered his purpose for coming to the Great An Forest: helping Tian Bo find medicinal herbs for recovery.

Over a month had passed, far exceeding the one-month deadline. Though he had communicated with Lu Kunpeng via the Dan Pavilion’s token, he didn’t know the specific situation. Luo Tian was worried.

He took out the Dan Pavilion token, and a flood of spiritual awareness formed voices in Luo Tian’s ears.

“Boy, the person you want to heal has already been informed by the Dan Pavilion. I can only let him live one more month. If I can’t produce the body-reforming pills you mentioned, don’t blame me!” Lu Kunpeng’s voice echoed.

“Luo Tian! Where are you? Reply immediately!” Dong Sansi’s anxious voice.

“Luo Tian, hurry back to the Dan Pavilion. Xuan Yin Sect has sent strong forces to block you at the Great An Forest’s perimeter. Be careful! I and Lei Yongji are not in Wuxing Sect, so be cautious yourself. I’ve already contacted Wuxing Sect’s strong forces to assist you. If things get too dire, stay hidden in the Great An Forest until our people arrive! Prioritize your life!” Zhang Ziping’s voice came through, filled with deep concern.

Clearly, Zhang Ziping was wary of Xuan Yin Sect’s strength; otherwise, he wouldn’t have spoken so extensively to Luo Tian.

Under the pleas of Long Jian’s wife and the fierce beasts, Luo Tian explained his situation. Seeing Luo Tian’s eagerness to leave, Long Jian and his wife transported him directly to where Dong Sansi and the others were searching.

“Woo…” A surge of spiritual energy spread, and Luo Tian landed steadily on the ground. He marveled at Long Jian’s power and the marvel of this transportation technique.

“Luo Tian!” A loud shout startled Luo Tian from his admiration.

Looking up, Dong Sansi and the group wore ecstatic expressions as they ran toward Luo Tian, who had appeared out of nowhere.

Luo Tian felt a warmth in his heart. He memorized each of their faces—these were people with genuine feelings. Some had never even met him before, yet they risked their lives to search for him in the Great An Forest.

“Thank you all for your concern!” Luo Tian bowed slightly, expressing gratitude.

“You’re too kind, Senior Brother. Without you, we might have gained nothing and even lost our lives!”

“Indeed! A yellow-grade high-level weapon, countless spiritual stones—our journey through the Great An Forest has truly been a windfall!” The group all bowed in response.

“Your kindness is deeply remembered, but the spiritual vein cannot be shared. A senior has already used it. I apologize to all of you, but rest assured, I will ensure your satisfaction!” Luo Tian’s face showed a sorry expression.

The group had already guessed that Luo Tian’s disappearance was related to the spiritual vein. They hadn’t expected much, but since Luo Tian had always been generous, they all said it was fine.

After exchanging pleasantries, worried about Tian Bo’s safety, the group rushed out of the Great An Forest.

“Long Brother! The bone-devouring stage outsider…” Bai Yuqin asked with concern, her face showing worry. At their level of cultivation, they naturally knew there was a bone-devouring stage figure outside the Great An Forest, clearly hostile toward Luo Tian.

“This is a test for this boy. If he can’t defeat even this bone-devouring stage, it means he lacks the strength to protect our son. I’ll bring him back and keep him within this Great An Forest,” Long Jian said, his face serious.

...

Luo Tian and the group sped off. The fierce beasts around them naturally cleared a path without hindering, not only due to Long Jian’s warning but also because Luo Tian’s dragon clan bloodline’s pressure made the fierce beasts hesitate to approach.

Not long after, they finally exited the Great An Forest.

Looking back at the Great An Forest, Luo Tian felt a surge of emotion. This place had truly been his fortune—two entries, two transformations.

“Senior Brother Luo, should we head to Tianyuan City or directly return to Wuxing Sect?” Dong Sansi asked.

“Haha, you won’t be going anywhere! Let’s head west instead!” A cold voice entered their ears.

After the voice, a bone-devouring stage’s unique pressure enveloped them all.

“Bone-devouring stage!” A Wuxing Sect disciple murmured in low voice.

Other disciples of Wuxing Sect wore expressions of fear. The voice clearly wasn’t friendly. Even if they were strong, none could match a bone-devouring stage powerhouse.

Luo Tian heard the voice and furrowed his brows. This voice was strange—though it seemed far away, Luo Tian’s fusion with the Killing Pearl made him sensitive to killing intent. He could clearly feel this killing intent was close.

“Xuan Yin Sect?” Luo Tian muttered darkly, recalling that Wang Siyuan had used this hidden technique during their fight.

“Boy, you’re quite smart. You’ve made me wait a long time!” A voice laced with irritation echoed.

“But killing you will surely be a great achievement for me when I return to the Sect. Heh, advise you not to resist. Though you’re strong, there’s an unbridgeable gap between body-refining and bone-devouring stages!” The voice added with contempt.

The group, including Dong Sansi, wore expressions of despair. They knew Luo Tian was strong but clearly too weak for a bone-devouring stage powerhouse.

“Ridiculous!” Luo Tian sneered, extending his spiritual awareness and launching a punch into the void.

Chapter 162: Battle Against Bone-Devouring Stage

Chapter 162: Battle Against Bone-Devouring Stage

Dong Sansi and the others hadn’t expected Luo Tian to attack so boldly. But seeing where he punched, they chuckled bitterly.

To them, Luo Tian’s punch was clearly reckless. Though the power was immense, there was no one there—how could it hit?

“You!” The bone-devouring stage voice sounded startled.

“Boom…” After the “You,” there was no more sound.

A jaw-dropping sight appeared: a black-cloaked figure materialized in front of them, blocking Luo Tian’s punch.

Luo Tian wore a regretful expression, thinking: “Bone-devouring stage is bone-devouring stage. My surprise punch didn’t even harm him!”

“How did you find my hiding place?” The black-cloaked figure asked, his face filled with disbelief.

“Guess!” Luo Tian didn’t want to talk to the black-cloaked figure and flashed in front of him, throwing another punch.

Dong Sansi’s group wore expressions of great joy. Luo Tian had moved so fast they hadn’t seen him move—only a shadow flickered.

Next moment, Luo Tian’s fist, imbued with five attributes, flew again.

“Boom…” The black-cloaked figure was stunned. He hadn’t expected a body-refining stage boy to move so fast, and the pressure from his five-colored fist was no less than a typical bone-devouring stage.

The black-cloaked figure coldly returned a punch.

The booming sound echoed again. Luo Tian took a few steps back, his face showing satisfaction. His guess was correct—apart from lacking an osseous bone, he was almost the same as a bone-devouring stage.

At this moment, the black-cloaked figure was in turmoil. He had never imagined a minor body-refining eighth-stage could push him back.

He vanished from sight again, not believing Luo Tian could easily find him.

“Idiot!” Luo Tian sneered, and the Splitting Heaven Spear appeared in his hand instantly.

“Five Elements Mutual Generation, Golden Snake Wild Dance!” A golden dragon snake formed a river of gold, rushing into the void.

This golden dragon snake was far stronger than before. It no longer seemed like a single snake but a massive golden dragon!

“Roar!” The golden dragon snake roared, as if tearing the void apart. It flew forward with terrifying waves.

The deafening boom once again pulled Dong Sansi’s group back to reality. Their gazes toward Luo Tian turned fervent. At the moment the golden dragon snake formed, they felt like bowing—such pressure could only be given by a bone-devouring stage powerhouse.

“Cough cough…” The black-cloaked figure reappeared, but no longer casually. His shoulder had two deep wounds that bled constantly.

His eyes also showed infinite fear. He hadn’t expected a body-refining stage boy’s martial art to be so powerful, even injuring him.

Yet before he could react, another terrifying wave formed in the void. A strong sense of crisis surged from his heart.

“Boom…” The Five Elements King Seal smashed into him, and another cloud of dust rose.

“Good!” Dong Sansi’s group all cheered, eyes burning with fervor. To wound a bone-devouring stage with body-refining eighth-stage—this achievement would make anyone admire him.

Luo Tian, however, furrowed his brows and said coldly: “Shadow!”

As soon as Luo Tian’s words were spoken, a strong sense of crisis surged in his heart.

Luo Tian quickly dodged and reached for his neck.

“Snap…” A clear sound echoed. A sharp blade, radiating killing intent, was only a little away from Luo Tian’s neck—his neck already had a streak of blood.

The first strike wasn’t heavy, but the black-cloaked figure withdrew his blade and vanished again.

Luo Tian’s spiritual awareness extended, but he only found a shadow running in his spiritual awareness—his spiritual awareness was even slightly slower than the black-cloaked figure’s speed.

“Boy, do you know who I am? It's because of my speed that I was given the name 'Shadow.' My body type is gold-elemental. When I entered bone-devouring stage, my osseous bone was my leg bone, so my speed is unmatched by most bone-devouring stages. Hence, people gave me the nickname 'Shadow.'” The black-cloaked figure’s voice echoed coldly from the shadow.

“Even if your spiritual awareness has reached the late stage of spiritual perception, or even peak, you still can’t keep up with my speed, heh!” The arrogant and confident voice echoed in their ears.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly. This person’s speed was truly变态 (abnormal). Luo Tian, while secretly admiring that bone-devouring stage masters weren’t easy to deal with, also remained vigilant against Shadow’s attacks. If he was even slightly distracted, his life might be lost here.

“First strike… third strike!” Every time Luo Tian was distracted, Shadow’s attack would come as scheduled. He used the concept of one strike and immediate retreat perfectly.

Luo Tian paid a painful price for this, his body covered with wounds of all sizes. The worst was a deep wound from top to bottom on his back.

The black-cloaked figure’s blade seemed to be a treasure. Any place it cut would bleed uncontrollably. Luo Tian used wood-elemental spiritual energy to recover, but it only slightly slowed the bleeding.

Luo Tian panted heavily. His spiritual awareness was at its peak, his eyes red. He roared mentally: “Even if you are a bone-devouring stage master, I don’t believe your spiritual energy never runs out. You won’t get tired!”

“Haha, boy, just let me kill you already. It would be more convenient!” Shadow’s voice echoed. He was also exhausted and wanted to speak to distract Luo Tian.

But he didn’t expect that his speech not only distracted Luo Tian but also lowered his own attention.

“Now!” Feeling Shadow’s body pause for a moment when he spoke, Luo Tian roared and seized the opportunity. He had secretly prepared the Soul-Stealing Seal and launched it.

A mournful sound echoed, and Shadow’s body reappeared before them. However, he was now writhing in pain on the ground.

Luo Tian showed no mercy. The Splitting Heaven Spear and the Five Elements King Seal were launched.

“Boom…”

Under the stunned gazes of Dong Sansi’s group, Luo Tian unleashed all his combat power. Another cloud of dust rose.

When the dust settled, what met their eyes was a bone-devouring stage master pierced by the Splitting Heaven Spear and pinned to the ground.

Chapter 163: Return

Chapter 163: Return

“He! He’s dead?” A Wuxing Sect disciple’s eyes showed disbelief, staring at Shadow lying like a dog on the ground.

“Seems so!” Everyone’s eyes trembled as they looked at Luo Tian.

With body-refining eighth-stage, defeating a bone-devouring early-stage master—Luo Tian’s achievement was truly unmatched by body-refining stage.

Throughout history, few people have defeated bone-devouring stage masters in the body-refining stage. Those who achieved it became legendary figures, leading their eras on Tianyuan Continent.

Luo Tian had previously defeated the bone-devouring stage Lan Yu, but his condition was clearly abnormal then. And Lan Yu’s strength wasn’t truly bone-devouring stage.

Today, Luo Tian had defeated a bone-devouring stage master with his true strength. Dong Sansi’s group knew that if this achievement spread, it would echo across the Tianyuan Continent—not for any other reason but because of this astonishing achievement.

Luo Tian was also excited, but later he sighed at how difficult it was to deal with bone-devouring stage masters. He had exhausted all his tricks and nearly died at their hands, but he was fortunate to have peak spiritual perception.

“Let’s go back to Wuxing Sect!” Luo Tian’s voice interrupted the group’s daze.

Wang Tianxiang also greeted Luo Tian and left for Kuandao Sect alone.

Not long after Luo Tian’s group departed, a faint light flew out of the Great An Forest and landed on the dragon mark on Luo Tian’s wrist. However, no one noticed it—neither did Luo Tian sense this aura.

“This boy is quite good!” Long Jian’s face showed approval.

But Luo Tian was completely unaware of this. The group rushed to Wuxing Sect with haste.

Along the way, Luo Tian saw how severe the conflict between Wuxing Sect and Xuan Yin Sect was. Everywhere were Wuxing Sect disciples, in groups of three or five, cautious.

Luo Tian also encountered several Xuan Yin Sect groups and dealt with them conveniently. After all, the incident had started because of him.

The group quickly reached Wuxing Sect. Looking at its vast mountain gate, Luo Tian felt a surge of sentiment. He had left with Gu Lei and Gu Qianxue, but now he returned alone.

Sentimentally, Luo Tian led Dong Sansi’s group into the mountain gate.

“Luo Tian!” As soon as they entered, Wuxing Sect disciples noticed Luo Tian and shouted.

Luo Tian’s fame within Wuxing Sect was like the sun—unparalleled. These days, many Wuxing Sect disciples had died at Xuan Yin Sect’s hands. This news had spread within the sect, making some disciples resent Luo Tian.

Luo Tian saw the cold and even hostile glances around him. He wore a bitter smile, while Dong Sansi’s group felt anger but eventually sighed helplessly—this kind of people left them speechless.

After entering Wuxing Sect, disciples from other peaks who had gone to the Great An Forest also said goodbye to Luo Tian and headed back to their own peaks.

Luo Tian ignored the surrounding glances and led Dong Sansi toward the Dan Pavilion.

Entering the Dan Pavilion, the disciples there were still respectful to Luo Tian, unlike other peaks. This was a difference of the Dan Pavilion—its unity was renowned within Wuxing Sect. They believed that even if Luo Tian had done something wrong, it was right. This was the Dan Pavilion’s style.

“Senior Brother Luo! Dan Master!” The surrounding people smiled. Killing Xuan Yin Sect’s genius Wang Siyuan, this achievement would make Luo Tian famous in the northern region. Naturally, it was Wuxing Sect Dan Pavilion’s fame. Though the Dan Pavilion didn’t care about this reputation, it was better to have a stronger one.

Luo Tian felt the deep kindness of the Dan Pavilion disciples and felt warm. He smiled and bowed to each disciple around him, then rushed like the wind toward Lu Kunpeng’s residence. Dong Sansi went to the Herbal Hall.

Rushing all the way, Luo Tian finally reached Lu Kunpeng’s residence. Lu Kunpeng was leisurely standing in his study, looking at the pharmacopoeia, with a serious expression on his face.

Luo Tian lightly knocked on the door, interrupting Lu Kunpeng.

Seeing Luo Tian arrive, Lu Kunpeng’s face showed a hint of joy. He knew about Luo Tian’s experiences in the Great An Forest. Luo Tian was the future of the Dan Pavilion. If Zhang Ziping hadn’t been absent and needed to stay in the Dan Pavilion, Lu Kunpeng might have personally gone to the Great An Forest to escort Luo Tian back.

Now seeing Luo Tian safely returned, Lu Kunpeng was naturally overjoyed. However, his joy was brief and quickly returned to calmness: “You’re back!”

Though the joy was fleeting, Luo Tian still felt Lu Kunpeng’s joy and felt warm again.

“Come on! If you don’t return, Gu Yun might get worried!” Lu Kunpeng clearly felt good and smiled at Luo Tian.

“Uncle Gu is also in the Dan Pavilion?” Luo Tian hadn’t expected the Gu family to have been brought to the Dan Pavilion and asked softly.

“You little rascal, you killed their treasure. Do you think Xuan Yin Sect would let go of them? You don’t know how powerful Xuan Yin Sect’s intelligence is. I believe the news of your return to Wuxing Sect has already reached Xuan Yin Sect!” Lu Kunpeng looked at Luo Tian with a bit of reproach.

Hearing Lu Kunpeng’s words, Luo Tian suddenly understood and cursed himself for being careless. If Xuan Yin Sect really wanted to retaliate against him, a small Gu family could not resist even a few body-refining ninth-stage disciples.

Thinking of this, Luo Tian bowed respectfully: “Thank you, Grand Elder!”

This was a sincere bow. He couldn’t imagine what would happen if the Gu family were destroyed. How could he face Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei?

“Come on, as an elder, I’m here to clean up for the juniors! Besides, you’re the most important person in my Dan Pavilion!” Lu Kunpeng waved his hand dismissively and led Luo Tian outside.

The two of them walked to the back mountain of the Dan Pavilion, where Lu Kunpeng had settled the Gu family.

The Dan Pavilion’s peak was vast enough to accommodate the Gu family. The Gu family, being a pharmaceutical clan, could also live in the Dan Pavilion.

At this moment, young members of the Gu family were either refining medicine or diligently cultivating. They never forgot that night’s events.

Seeing Lu Kunpeng and Luo Tian arrive, the Gu family members all bowed to Lu Kunpeng. As for Luo Tian, young members of the Gu family gazed at him with intense eyes.

Chapter 164: Wealthy

Chapter 164: Wealthy

Gu Yun rushed out from the courtyard upon hearing of Lu Kunpeng and Luo Tian’s arrival. Seeing Luo Tian safely standing before him, his face showed relief but also a bitter smile.

Perhaps too much had happened these days. Gu Yun was only in his early forties, but his temples were already streaked with white.

“Uncle Gu, how is Tian Bo?” Luo Tian saw Gu Yun’s bitter smile and guessed Tian Bo’s condition but still asked.

“Ah… you should see for yourself!” Gu Yun smiled bitterly and led Luo Tian and Lu Kunpeng into the courtyard.

The three of them slowly approached a quiet house and entered it.

As soon as he stepped in, Luo Tian’s gaze fell on Tian Bo lying in bed. His heart tightened.

At this moment, Tian Bo had no signs of life on his face. His already frail body was even more emaciated, clearly at the end of his life. If it weren’t for a faint breath still flowing within him, Luo Tian would have thought Tian Bo was already dead.

“The Dan Pavilion’s herbal hall has been checked. Only half of the herbs on your list are available. I’ve sent people to collect the remaining, but not many have been gathered. Three herbs are still missing! And these three are precisely the most difficult to find!”

Lu Kunpeng said seriously.

“Which three?” Luo Tian asked. He didn’t know how many herbs were in his storage ring. When he left, Long Jian and his wife had given him a pile of herbs. He had rushed out without carefully categorizing them, leaving them in his storage ring. Now, his storage ring was filled with spiritual energy from the herbs.

“Millennium Earth Spirit Mushroom, Ten-Thousand-Year Qingming Branch, and Mingxin Dragon Flower!” Lu Kunpeng said with helplessness.

Hearing these three items, Luo Tian’s face also showed concern. He naturally knew how precious these items were. He wasn’t sure if his mountain of herbs contained these three.

“Where can we find these? Especially the Mingxin Dragon Flower—only in places with dragons can it grow!” Gu Yun’s face also showed bitterness.

Luo Tian said nothing, extending his spiritual awareness into the storage ring and searching for the herbs Lu Kunpeng mentioned.

Seeing Luo Tian say nothing, they all hoped he could find these three herbs. Even one would give them some hope.

The room fell into temporary silence, everyone watching Luo Tian, waiting for his results.

Gu Yun’s face showed despair. Though he knew Luo Tian might have found something in the Great An Forest, Lu Kunpeng’s three herbs were each a rare treasure. How could they find all three?

Thinking of this, Gu Yun felt even more sorrow and guilt, looking at the old man who had devoted his life to the Gu family. His heart was full of guilt.

“Found it!” Luo Tian felt overjoyed, extending his hand. A mushroom-like herb appeared in his hand and was handed to the group.

As soon as Luo Tian’s hand extended, spiritual energy formed by grass and trees filled this small room.

“Millennium Earth Spirit Mushroom! I didn’t expect you found it!” Lu Kunpeng’s face showed joy, looking at the herb in Luo Tian’s hand.

Gu Yun also wore a hint of joy but soon returned to worry. Though one herb was found, it eased his worries slightly, but two were still missing.

At this moment, after handing the Millennium Earth Spirit Mushroom to Lu Kunpeng, Luo Tian had another green branch in his hand.

As the branch appeared, spiritual energy from grass and trees became even more abundant. Tian Bo lying in bed even had a faint flush of color on his face.

“Ten-Thousand-Year Qingming Branch! How is this possible!”

At this moment, Lu Kunpeng let out a low shout, breathing heavily and looking at the seemingly unremarkable branch in Luo Tian’s hand with disbelief.

The Ten-Thousand-Year Qingming Branch, as its name suggests, requires branches from a Qingming tree that has lived for ten thousand years. Qingming trees themselves are rare in the world, and finding one that has lived for ten thousand years is extremely difficult.

Gu Yun’s breathing became urgent. Two herbs had been found, and now only one remained for Tian Bo to have a chance of recovery. This made him excited, his eyes filled with infinite hope and expectation for Luo Tian to surprise him again.

Lu Kunpeng was also excited. Seeing two rare herbs, this made the Dan Master who had spent his life with herbs very excited.

Both of them focused their eyes on Luo Tian, hoping this young man would produce the most precious Mingxin Dragon Flower.

But soon they were disappointed. Luo Tian furrowed his brows, wearing a thoughtful expression.

“Luo Tian, what’s wrong? If it’s not there, just say so!” Gu Yun looked disappointed and spoke softly.

“It’s not that… I’m just…” Luo Tian wore a puzzled expression, speaking softly.

“What is it?” Lu Kunpeng looked impatient. He didn’t know what Luo Tian was up to, but he had no high hopes that Luo Tian would produce the Dragon Flower.

Gu Yun also didn’t have high hopes. After all, how rare was the Dragon Flower? He had heard Lu Kunpeng describe it before.

“Roar…” A golden flower appeared in Luo Tian’s hand. As soon as the golden flower appeared, a roaring sound of dragons could be heard.

“This… this is…” Lu Kunpeng and Gu Yun looked at the golden flower in Luo Tian’s hand with disbelief.

“Is this the Mingxin Dragon Flower?” Lu Kunpeng asked in a trembling voice, as he had never seen the Mingxin Dragon Flower before.

“This should be it!” Luo Tian said helplessly.

“Smack…” As soon as Luo Tian finished speaking, Lu Kunpeng’s big hand smacked onto Luo Tian’s head.

“Little bastard! You had it but didn’t just show it off? What are you trying to be mysterious for? Hurting my feelings!” Lu Kunpeng’s face showed anger, thinking Luo Tian was being mysterious. But he grabbed the flower from Luo Tian’s hand and examined it carefully.

“It should be correct, this is definitely the Mingxin Dragon Flower. And it’s of a high grade—only growing near dragons! Did you enter the dragon’s den?” Lu Kunpeng smiled, saying.

Hearing Lu Kunpeng’s confirmation, Gu Yun looked at the golden flower with excitement. Three herbs—Luo Tian had them all! This meant Tian Bo’s life could be saved!

Thinking of this, Gu Yun’s eyes became moist. He looked at Luo Tian with gratitude. This young man had given more to the Gu family than they had ever given him!

Chapter 165: Great Spirit Cauldron

Chapter 165: Great Spirit Cauldron

Hearing Lu Kunpeng’s words, Luo Tian secretly smiled. This old man guessed quite accurately—he had indeed spent some time in the dragon’s den.

“Boy! What are you smiling about?” Lu Kunpeng was in high spirits, seeing Luo Tian laughing foolishly. He asked softly.

“N-nothing!” Luo Tian quickly replied, fearing this old man would do that again.

“Hmph! Mysterious! Tell me, why were you frowning earlier? Did you have more herbs to show?” Lu Kunpeng asked again.

Hearing Lu Kunpeng’s question, and seeing his greedy expression, Luo Tian felt a chill in his heart. He quickly replied: “No! No!”

Seeing Luo Tian shaking his head like a pendulum, Lu Kunpeng knew immediately that Luo Tian had more treasures to show. His face showed a smile: “Boy, as far as I know, besides those few reclusive old masters in the Dan Pavilion, there’s only me who is a sixth-grade alchemist!”

Hearing Lu Kunpeng’s words, Luo Tian knew immediately that Lu Kunpeng was trying to squeeze him. He waved his hand, and a series of dragon roars echoed again.

Lu Kunpeng and Gu Yun stared in disbelief at Luo Tian. Golden flowers flew out of his hands one after another.

“One… two… thirteen…” When the thirteenth flower flew out, Luo Tian stopped.

The narrow room was filled with golden light, shining on the three of them. The spiritual energy from grass and trees was at its peak.

“Are these all Mingxin Dragon Flowers?” Gu Yun asked hesitantly, disbelieving the golden flowers were the herbs that had made him despair for a month.

“Seems like it!” Lu Kunpeng was also stunned, looking at the surrounding flowers with a dreamy expression.

“I was just thinking about which year was higher!” Luo Tian shrugged, wearing an innocent look.

He hadn’t expected that Long Jian and his wife had given him so many Dragon Flowers. He had noticed the clusters of flowers by the cave but, due to his haste, hadn’t identified them carefully. He had thought they were just ordinary herbs but hadn’t realized they were the legendary Mingxin Dragon Flowers.

Hearing Luo Tian’s answer, not only did Lu Kunpeng but also Gu Yun wanted to slap him.

Gu Yun inwardly roared: “Don’t play with me like this! What were you thinking? Didn’t you know my heart almost broke!”

Lu Kunpeng, meanwhile, rushed to the thirteen Mingxin Dragon Flowers and was captivated. His face turned red: “Luo Tian! You little bastard! Putting such precious herbs on the ground like that!”

Lu Kunpeng waved his hand, and several jade boxes appeared before him. He carefully placed the thirteen Mingxin Dragon Flowers into them.

“Hmph! These will be my fee for refining the pills!” Lu Kunpeng said softly.

Seeing that Lu Kunpeng hadn’t even asked his permission but took the boxes, and with a self-assured expression, Luo Tian’s face twitched. He thought to himself: “Old people have no shame; old trees have no bark!”

But Luo Tian only thought it in his heart. He wouldn’t dare say it out loud. At the same time, he was grateful that he hadn’t shown all of them—otherwise, he might have been squeezed even more. Seeing this old man’s attitude, it was likely that whatever he showed, Lu Kunpeng would squeeze the same amount.

“Alright, let’s get to the main issue. Now that the herbs are complete, we can start preparing the body-reforming pills you mentioned. After all, Tian Yangtian cannot be delayed,” Lu Kunpeng said seriously to the two of them.

Lu Kunpeng had heard of Tian Yangtian before. At that time, he was just a lowly disciple. Now, after hundreds of years, he hadn’t expected that the once-renowned Tian Yangtian would have fallen into such a state.

“First, let’s clarify—this body-reforming pill I’ve never refined before. I can’t guarantee how many chances it has. I’ll do my best!” Lu Kunpeng made his escape plan in advance.

“Elder, please rest assured. If it truly fails, I will still be grateful for your kindness!” Gu Yun bowed and said.

“Also! Luo boy, I need you to help me refine the pills. This will be beneficial for your future!” Hearing Gu Yun’s words, Lu Kunpeng nodded in satisfaction and said to Luo Tian.

Hearing Lu Kunpeng’s words, Luo Tian wore a big smile. Being able to watch a sixth-grade alchemist refine pills was an invaluable experience for any alchemist.

At the same time, Luo Tian felt grateful. Being allowed to watch meant Lu Kunpeng considered him a trustworthy person.

“Thank you, Grand Elder!” Luo Tian also bowed respectfully.

The three of them discussed the specific steps and then headed to Lu Kunpeng’s residence. After all, refining a sixth-grade pill was quite noisy and couldn’t be disturbed. Lu Kunpeng’s place was the best choice.

Lu Kunpeng’s courtyard was much better than Luo Tian’s original one. Moreover, Lu Kunpeng had his own separate alchemy room, which made Luo Tian envious.
