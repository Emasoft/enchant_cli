Lei Yongji, Chen Yuting, and others slowly stepped forward to prevent Luo Tian from suffering an accident.

"Where is Chen Yuting?" Luo Tian ignored the surrounding clamor, his gaze cold as he stared at Li Xiuping.

"To know that, ask her yourself!" Li Xiuping sneered and pointed at Lan Yu, who had remained motionless.

"Kill him!" Before Luo Tian could ask further, Li Xiuping coldly told Lan Yu.

Upon hearing Li Xiuping's command, Lan Yu's eyes flashed red. Her figure vanished from the spot and instantly appeared before Luo Tian, her pre-Bone-Subjugation Realm cultivation gathering into a fist to strike him.

Luo Tian sensed Lan Yu's disappearance through his spiritual awareness and had already prepared himself. His fist, wrapped in five types of spiritual energy, met Lan Yu's withered fist head-on.

"Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!" Deep footprints formed before Luo Tian, cracks spreading outward. Luo Tian took several steps back, his face flushed with redness.

"The Bone-Subjugation Realm is truly formidable. Though not as strong as a true pre-Bone-Subjugation Realm master, it's still Bone-Subjugation. I can't match him in a direct clash!" Luo Tian mused internally.

Yet Lan Yu gave no chance for Luo Tian to think, charging forward again with fists like a storm.

Luo Tian's eyes flashed with cruelty as he summoned the Human King Seal, knowing there was no escape. He could only defend passively.

But Luo Tian underestimated the Bone-Subjugation Realm's power; within a few breaths, he felt his internal energy churning and saw cracks forming on his body. Blood gushed from every wound.

"Senior Brother, go help Luo Tian! If this continues, he'll die!" Gu Qianxue urgently called to Lei Yong.

"Wait a moment. Fencing with a Bone-Subjugation Realm master is an experience. Though we spar normally, it's not a life-or-death battle. Only in death can one truly unlock potential!" Lei Yong stared intently at Luo Tian, preparing to intervene when he faltered.

"Indeed, Luo Tian's cultivation has risen too fast. He needs refinement. Ordinary Body-Refining Realm disciples can't match him, and the Bone-Subjugation Realm is too high. This old woman's strength isn't even pre-Bone-Subjugation; she has no will, just a puppet. Compared to true Bone-Subjugation Realm masters, she's far weaker!" Ning Qingzhu comforted Gu Qianxue.

Hearing Lei Yong's words, Gu Qianxue relaxed slightly but still wore a worried expression.

"This can't continue! But I have no means to harm her. The Rending Sky Spear could, but it's too weak. The Soul-Stealing Seal should cause her great harm, but my incantation takes too long. Lan Yu won't give me the chance!"

Luo Tian gritted his teeth, but more wounds formed on his body. Blood poured from his mouth like water.

"This Luo Tian is truly abnormal! How can he fight a Bone-Subjugation Realm master!"

Feiyun Sect disciples marveled at Luo Tian, their faces filled with disbelief. If someone could challenge a Body-Refining Realm master, they'd believe it. But if someone could fight a Bone-Subjugation Realm master, they'd call him mad.

Yet the truth stood before them: Luo Tian was clashing with Feiyun Sect's elder, Lan Yu. Though her state was strange, it left them speechless.

Not only Feiyun Sect disciples but also Wuxing Sect's were stunned, watching Luo Tian. They knew his strength, but never imagined he could fight a Bone-Subjugation Realm master. Though he was at a disadvantage and still endured, it wasn't something a Body-Refining Realm disciple could achieve.

"If this boy were in my Feiyun Sect, within ten years, we'd be the top among first-rate sects!" One elder sighed, watching Luo Tian tightly controlled.

"What a pity! Such a promising talent was expelled from the sect. A great irony!" Elders murmured.

Deng Jiusi's face darkened; he hadn't expected Luo Tian to be so extraordinary.

People murmured, but Luo Tian's condition was dire—his body was in tatters. His arms felt heavier, his eyes drowsier, as if weighted with lead.

"Haha, kid, how's it feeling? A Bone-Subjugation Realm master as your opponent—does that please you?" Li Xiuping smiled, seeing Luo Tian near his limit.

This couldn't continue; I need to think of a plan!

Luo Tian defended while sending his spiritual awareness into Lan Yu's mind: "Lan Yu, I'm Luo Tian! Do you remember me?"

The attacking Lan Yu heard Luo Tian's voice. No one noticed her punch slow slightly—neither Li Xiuping nor the others.

But Luo Tian, locked in combat with her, felt her change and his eyes lit up: "It worked!"

Thinking this, Luo Tian's voice echoed into Lan Yu's mind again: "Lan Yu, where is Chen Yuting?"

Luo Tian's voice thundered in Lan Yu's mind.

Chapter 102: Suicide ()
Chapter 102: Suicide

"Where is Chen Yuting?" When Luo Tian's voice rang out again, Lan Yu stiffened. Her eyes showed pain, and she let out a low growl!

This time, Li Xiuping noticed Lan Yu's change. His face twisted in shock and carved a seal in the air with his blood.

A sinister aura formed from Li Xiuping's hand, then pushed into Lan Yu's back.

Lan Yu's eyes turned blood-red again, returning to her original state. She lunged at Luo Tian with increased ferocity.

But in the moment Lan Yu paused, Luo Tian retreated far away. This brief window was enough for him.

Luo Tian's hands shifted rapidly, gathering his mid-Stage Spiritual Awareness. Though invisible, the crowd felt a terrifying fluctuation. A seal-shaped shadow formed in his hands.

At the moment the spiritual awareness seal was complete, Lan Yu's figure arrived before Luo Tian. Her fist, wrapped in golden spiritual energy, smashed down.

"Be careful!" Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei cried out.

Other Wuxing Sect disciples watched anxiously. To them, Luo Tian was in grave danger; Lan Yu's fist was nearly upon him.

Lei Yong and Ji Chen had their spiritual energy activated, their legs tensed.

"Soul-Stealing Seal! Go!" Luo Tian gambled everything, hoping his Soul-Stealing Seal could harm Lan Yu. If it failed, he might die here—Bone-Subjugation Realm fists weren't easy to withstand.

A gust of wind swept across Luo Tian and Lan Yu's faces.

Luo Tian clearly felt the explosive power on Lan Yu's fist. If hit, even with his abnormal body strength, he'd survive but be severely injured.

Lucky for him, he guessed right. When the Soul-Stealing Seal struck Lan Yu's head, her fist halted abruptly and she retreated.

"The Soul-Stealing Seal is a spiritual attack. Since it worked on her, then..." Luo Tian caught his breath, staring at Lan Yu with renewed intensity.

Looking at Lan Yu, she stood like a chicken, unmoving despite Li Xiuping's commands. Her eyes flickered with red light, and sinister energy spilled from her body.

"Damn! This old woman isn't under my control anymore!" Li Xiuping cursed, spitting out a mouthful of blood.

Lei Yong watched Lan Yu anxiously. Luo Tian clearly had no more strength, and if she attacked again, he'd die. How could he let Luo Tian die? Training was one thing, but training to death wasn't what Lei Yong wanted.

Though Luo Tian had expended much energy, he still had three-tenths left. His spiritual awareness was exhausted, though; without it, his eyes couldn't match the Bone-Subjugation Realm's terrifying speed.

Li Xiuping's face darkened. Knowing Lan Yu was connected to him, he realized she was no longer under his control. He didn't know what changes she might undergo—perhaps returning to normal, or becoming a killing machine corrupted by sinister energy.

Under everyone's gaze, Lan Yu's aura gradually calmed. She suddenly opened her eyes, a clear expression on her face.

Luo Tian felt relieved upon seeing Lan Yu's clear eyes.

"Lan Yu, do you remember me?" Luo Tian asked cautiously.

Hearing the voice, Lan Yu turned her gaze to Luo Tian. Seeing him, she smiled: "Of course I do. Though I was controlled, I remember what happened!"

"Then tell me where Chen Yuting is. How is she? Is she too afraid to face me?" Luo Tian asked, his expression complex—part satisfaction, part hatred, yet another indescribable feeling.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Lan Yu's face changed, turning sorrowful: "Ting'er... she..."

"What happened to her?" Luo Tian felt a bad premonition.

"Luo Tian, remember what I said—my mind is slipping again. Listen to me!" Lan Yu started to speak but her eyes flashed with sinister energy.

"Ting'er died... yes, Li Xiuping forced her to death... if you have the strength, avenge Ting'er. She loved you! She left you not by choice!" Lan Yu didn't wait for Luo Tian's reply and continued.

Hearing Lan Yu's fragmented words, Luo Tian was struck like lightning, frozen in place. His mind echoed with that sentence.

"Ting'er died! She loved you! Li Xiuping forced her to death!" The sentence echoed in Luo Tian's mind, conjuring a memory of a delicate woman.

After speaking, Lan Yu's sinister energy grew denser. She gazed at Luo Tian with one last moment of clarity, then raised her hand and smashed it into her head.

"Lan Senior Sister! No!" Feiyun Sect elders who were close to Lan Yu cried out. But Lan Yu knew her state—another hesitation would plunge her into endless killing.

"Smack..." A sound of something breaking echoed, and Feiyun Sect elders watched Lan Yu, who had been a Bone-Subjugation Realm master, fall dead.

People stared in disbelief at the fallen Lan Yu, stunned that a Bone-Subjugation Realm master had chosen suicide.

"Deng Jiusi! This isn't over! We'll report to the Sect Leader together—no matter if he's in seclusion, we'll disturb him!" Feiyun Sect elders roared.

As people marveled, Li Xiuping slipped unnoticed to Lan Yu's side, his expression grim: "Hmph. Old woman thinks dying can escape?"

Li Xiuping looked at the recently deceased Lan Yu and pulled out a talisman, pasting it onto her body.

"Control Corpse Talisman!" Lei Yong's face showed surprise; he hadn't expected Li Xiuping to have such a talisman. His mind recalled an ancient sect, the Tianshi Sect.

As Li Xiuping pasted the talisman onto Lan Yu's body, she rose again under everyone's stunned gaze. Her body was stiff, and her eyes lacked sinister energy—only closed.

Feiyun Sect elders watching Li Xiuping control Lan Yu again glared angrily: "Li Xiuping, do you have any humanity? She's dead; why control her corpse?"

Some disciples who had worshipped Li Xiuping now looked at him with anger. To them, his actions were excessive.

Chapter 103: Madness
Chapter 103: Madness

"Senior Brother, what's a Control Corpse Talisman?" Gu Lei asked Lei Yong with confusion.

"Control Corpse Talisman—its effect is simple: it uses a talisman to control corpses, making them fight for you. It was created by an ancient evil sect called the Tianshi Sect. Back then, they used this talisman to make the entire Tianyuan Continent littered with corpses. They often slaughtered weak sects and controlled their corpses to expand territory!" Lei Yong's voice was grave.

"Then that Tianshi Sect must have been invincible, right?" Gu Qianxue asked in shock.

"At first, the Tianshi Sect was just a second-rate sect and acted discreetly. Major sects ignored them, thinking they wouldn't threaten them. But as time passed, the sect quietly grew until it appeared on major sects' radar—no one could match them!" Ning Qingzhu, who knew the truth, continued.

"But how did the Tianshi Sect disappear? It was so powerful; why isn't it seen now?" Zhang Hongyun and others asked.

"Though the Tianshi Sect was at its peak, the major sects of Tianyuan Continent wouldn't let it grow unchecked. If they did, the continent would vanish. Finally, all sects united with smaller ones and the secular world's families to attack this sect for nearly ten years, breaking it up!" Lei Yong said with a sigh.

Others heard Lei Yong's words and were stunned. Hearing the word "broken up" was especially unbelievable—breaking up instead of exterminating meant some members had escaped.

All sects attacked for ten years; people compared it to the current Wuxing Sect. Imagine if Wuxing Sect was attacked—probably wouldn't last a year before being shattered. Thus, the Tianshi Sect must have been incredibly powerful.

"It was this attack on the Tianshi Sect that left most sects weakened, and from then on, some first-rate sects fell to second-rate. Feiyun Sect was one of them!" Lei Yong continued.

"Hope this Li Xiuping just found the talisman by chance. If he's connected to the Tianshi Sect, it means they've gained at least enough strength to match Wuxing Sect. Otherwise, he wouldn't dare appear so openly!" Ji Chen said seriously for the first time, his tone icy.

Others heard their conversation and felt shadows in their hearts. If it was truly the Tianshi Sect returning, the entire continent would be disturbed again.

Feiyun Sect elders knew about the Tianshi Sect, as their fall to second-rate was due to it.

"Deng Jiusi! This isn't your control anymore. No matter the outcome, Li Xiuping will be taken by Wuxing Sect!" Feiyun Sect elders murmured, reminding Deng Jiusi not to act foolishly.

Deng Jiusi stared at Li Xiuping, who seemed transformed. He couldn't believe Li Xiuping was connected to the Tianshi Sect at all.

As people murmured, Luo Tian—ignored until now—suddenly erupted with a red aura.

"What's wrong with Luo Tian?" Gu Lei cried out, drawing everyone's attention to him.

Luo Tian was wrapped in red spiritual energy; his eyes were blood-red, and tears of blood flowed down his cheeks. His state resembled Lan Yu's controlled one.

"Kill... kill Li Xiuping, kill Deng Jiusi! Kill, kill!" A voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind. He felt a crimson spiritual energy from the last page of his Chronicles of Epochs, filling his withered meridians.

"Has Luo Tian also been controlled by Li Xiuping?" Gu Lei worried.

"He doesn't seem to be; it's as if he entered this state himself! I sense a terrifying killing intent in his red energy—unlike the evil aura of that old woman!" Lei Yong explained.

"But where did this energy come from? How many people must be killed to gather such strong killing spiritual energy!" Gu Lei felt Luo Tian's aura and instinctively shivered.

"I don't know. This energy is beyond a Body-Refining Realm's capacity. Even I can barely withstand it!" Lei Yong finally showed worry.

"Kill..." Luo Tian roared to the sky, his voice piercing the clouds. He looked at all Feiyun Sect disciples with blood-red eyes.

The feeling of coldness swept through the Feiyun Sect disciples, especially those who had conspired against Luo Tian. Under this coldness, they trembled slightly.

Finally, Luo Tian's gaze fell on Li Xiuping. With a sliver of clarity, he rushed toward him like a blood mist, slow but surpassing Body-Refining Realm limits.

"Kill him!" Seeing Luo Tian's state approaching, Li Xiuping showed a grimace and muttered incantations, controlling Lan Yu's corpse to charge at Luo Tian.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian became a human beast, he punched Lan Yu who blocked him.

In people's shock, Luo Tian's punch collided with Lan Yu. Though she was a Bone-Subjugation Realm master, her current state had weakened her significantly. She wasn't a match for Luo Tian in this condition and flew away like a broken kite.

Luo Tian wasn't much better; his clenched fist showed white bones, and blood gushed from it.

But Luo Tian seemed unaware; his only thought was to kill Li Xiuping and Deng Jiusi, avenging Ting'er.

The blood's stimulation made Luo Tian's crimson spiritual energy stronger. The last page of his Chronicles of Epochs opened again, pouring the red energy into his meridians.

He kicked off the ground and vanished, appearing before Li Xiuping in a flash. His blood-red fist rose again and smashed down.

Chapter 104: Chaos
Chapter 104: Chaos

"One punch to send a Bone-Subjugation Realm master flying! This Luo Tian is truly abnormal!" Feiyun Sect elders trembled, discussing loudly.

"Though Lan Yu isn't fully Bone-Subjugation Realm, to send her flying with one punch—Luo Tian is definitely the strongest Body-Refining Realm in the Northern Region!" Feiyun Sect's Enforcement Elder Yu Pengfei said, his face bitter with regret.

"Great! Senior Brother Luo is invincible!" Wuxing Sect disciples shouted together.

Everything happened in a flash. When people were still stunned by Luo Tian's one punch sending Lan Yu flying, his fist had already fallen again.

Li Xiuping was now weak. Not only was he in this state, but even at his prime, he wouldn't match Luo Tian's current form.

"Li Xiuping is done!" People saw Luo Tian reach Li Xiuping and knew if nothing changed, he was doomed.

"Boom!" The sound of震荡 echoed again.

But people didn't see Li Xiuping's brains splatter; instead, a crimson spiritual energy spread outward. A weathered figure appeared before Luo Tian, blocking his punch.

"Deng Jiusi!" Luo Tian, still with a sliver of clarity, roared.

Indeed it was Deng Jiusi. Though Li Xiuping's current state made him unfamiliar, he couldn't let his only disciple die before his eyes. This was something Deng Jiusi couldn't do.

"Rending Sky Spear!" At this moment, Luo Tian was unstoppable—no one could stop him. Not even a Bone-Subjugation Realm late-stage master like Deng Jiusi. Even if it was an Yuanling Realm powerhouse, Luo Tian would still stab through with the spear. It had nothing to do with strength; he only wanted to kill, and no one could stop him. With a hum, the Rending Sky Spear fiercely pierced Deng Jiusi.

Deng Jiusi's Bone-Subjugation Realm late-stage strength didn't fear Luo Tian, a junior. Though he was slightly startled by Luo Tian's fierce killing intent, Deng Jiusi didn't consider this spear strong.

Faced with Luo Tian's furious spear, Deng Jiusi showed anger. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to dare attack him and casually grabbed the spear, coldly scolding: "Enough!"

Hearing Deng Jiusi's scolding, it felt like thunder to Luo Tian. The sliver of clarity in him regained a bit more awareness.

Deng Jiusi lightly waved his hand, releasing the spear. Luo Tian staggered back but wasn't harmed.

"Senior Brother help me!" Luo Tian roared again, rushing toward Deng Jiusi.

"Old man, can you scold my younger brother?" Lei Yong heard Luo Tian's words and glared. With their sect's protective nature, they wouldn't let Luo Tian be wronged.

Lightning surged from his body as he vanished. Ji Chen's eyes also showed killing intent; Luo Tian's current state was due to these two masters. Ji Chen couldn't tolerate it and, after Lei Yong, became a black mist and vanished.

Ning Qingzhu saw Lei Yong and Ji Chen go first, her emerald spiritual energy surged. She laughed: "Haha, I've disliked this old man for a long time!"

A group of Bone-Subjugation Realm masters aligned with Deng Jiusi saw the three rushing toward him. To avoid Deng Jiusi being at a disadvantage, thirty Bone-Subjugation Realm masters emerged and joined him. In a chain reaction, both sides of Bone-Subjugation Realm masters quickly faced off.

"All Wuxing Sect disciples, help me!" Luo Tian saw Bone-Subjugation Realm masters blocking him and roared again with blood-red eyes.

"Haha, Senior Master Luo, you must help! Otherwise, it's a waste of your coming!" All Wuxing Sect disciples who had come to Feiyun Sect agreed, gathering behind Luo Tian. Their eyes showed intense battle spirit.

"Deng Jiusi! Don't you dare keep Li Xiuping! Do you want Feiyun Sect to be destroyed?" Some elders who disliked Deng Jiusi roared, watching Luo Tian and his disciples panic.

Seeing Luo Tian's situation, Deng Jiusi's face turned red. A Bone-Subjugation Realm master was pushed to this state—how could he accept it? "I! Don't! Give!"

Deng Jiusi shouted the three words with his last strength. He knew the situation: nearly a thousand Wuxing Sect disciples and dozens of Bone-Subjugation Realm masters. Feiyun Sect had three thousand disciples, but their strength was clearly mismatched. Unless the Sect Leader emerged from seclusion, this crisis couldn't be resolved.

Deng Jiusi also knew giving Li Xiuping would calm Luo Tian's anger, but Li Xiuping was his life's work. He couldn't give him up.

"Kill!" Luo Tian ignored others and continued toward Li Xiuping. His eyes still only saw Li Xiuping; today, Li Xiuping would die!

"Kill!" Lei Yong shouted, lightning surged toward Deng Jiusi. Ji Chen also growled and attacked a mid-stage Bone-Subjugation Realm Feiyun Sect elder.

Gu Qianxue, Ning Qingzhu, and others also found their opponents and fought.

Feiyun Sect disciples,热血, seeing the attack, couldn't tolerate it. They activated their martial arts and clashed with Wuxing Sect disciples.

The Feiyun Sect's mountain gate was suddenly ablaze, with powerful spiritual energy fluctuations and booming sounds rising. The sky was filled with martial arts.

In Tianyuan City, Gu Yun furrowed his brows, listening to the distant booming sounds. He sighed: "It's started! I hope nothing goes wrong!"

In Feiyun Sect's mountain gate, a group of black-cloaked men smiled with sinister faces: "Kill! The more dead the better!"

"Unknown how Li Xiuping is doing. Elder Three, go save him!" An old man in black whispered.

"Okay!" Another old man around sixty replied and pushed open the door, stepping outside.

Luo Tian ignored others, searching for Li Xiuping in the crowd. His face showed no sorrow or joy; anyone blocking him was pierced with a spear, and none survived. If someone noticed carefully, these dead were those who had conspired against Luo Tian.

Others also became bloodthirsty. It was undeniable that Wuxing Sect disciples were much stronger than Feiyun Sect disciples. Though the latter had numerical superiority, they were like chickens and dogs being slaughtered. In contrast, Wuxing Sect disciples only suffered injuries without anyone dying.

This was a complete碾压. Though Wuxing Sect disciples weren't bloodthirsty, some existed—like Feng Qianyu, who seemed stimulated and killed anyone.

Luo Tian searched for Li Xiuping's figure until he lifted a Feiyun Sect disciple and found Li Xiuping.

No words, Luo Tian raised the Rending Sky Spear and rushed toward Li Xiuping. He arrived before him and stabbed with the spear.

This spear was as fast as lightning, containing years of resentment and hatred toward Li Xiuping.

"Kid, you can't kill him!" A black-cloaked figure appeared like a ghost and blocked Li Xiuping.

"Die!" Luo Tian ignored others and didn't stop.

Chapter 105: Feiyun Sect Leader
Chapter 105: Feiyun Sect Leader

The spear containing all of Luo Tian's resolve was his ultimate technique. This spear could harm Bone-Subjugation Realm masters, like a meteor streaking toward Li Xiuping.

The black-cloaked figure saw Luo Tian's fierce spear and showed a moment of tension. As a pre-Bone-Subjugation Realm master, he felt a tremor facing Luo Tian's spear. This feeling was impossible for a Body-Refining Realm warrior to give.

He gritted his teeth, recalling his master's orders. He didn't have time to think and stood before Li Xiuping, not even raising his arm. Luo Tian's spear had surpassed the Body-Refining Realm and could rival a Bone-Subjugation Realm master.

"Pop..." The sound of flesh being pierced echoed, insignificant in the chaos but shocking for the Bone-Subjugation Realm master. He hadn't expected to be injured by Luo Tian.

Seeing the Rending Sky Spear embedded several inches into his body, he showed disbelief. Especially the tearing sensation from the spear and Luo Tian's killing intent made this Bone-Subjugation Realm master uncomfortable. A streak of blood flowed from his mouth.

He didn't think further, grabbed Li Xiuping, and squeezed through the crowd to escape.

Li Xiuping was carried by the black-cloaked figure, turned back to look at Luo Tian, and smiled again. He whispered: "Luo Tian, you can't kill me. We'll meet again!"

Luo Tian continued chasing but was hindered by too many Body-Refining Realm people. He lost the black-cloaked figure and Li Xiuping's trail after a short distance.

"Ah..." Luo Tian roared to the sky, his anger reaching its peak. He began slaughtering Feiyun Sect disciples around him without discrimination, no longer caring if they were those who had conspired against him. It seemed only slaughter could calm his rage. Soon, the area around Luo Tian became a hellish scene; his robes were stained red with Feiyun Sect disciples' blood and his own.

"Stop!" A solemn voice echoed, followed by a terrifying pressure sweeping over Feiyun Sect.

"Roar!" A thunderous roar followed the voice.

Everyone stopped their actions upon hearing this sound, especially Feiyun Sect disciples who looked at the figure in the sky like saviors. At this moment, these Feiyun Sect disciples had no more courage but deep fear.

Feiyun Sect disciples suffered heavy casualties; often, three or four surrounded a Wuxing Sect disciple to cause some damage. It was only damage, not fatal. In contrast, Wuxing Sect disciples slaughtered freely like tigers in a sheepfold.

In just half an hour, Feiyun Sect's mountain gate was like hell, even the Bone-Subjugation Realm battlefield. Feiyun Sect's Bone-Subjugation Realm masters had over half dead, including those who hadn't fought with Deng Jiusi.

Deng Jiusi was also in agony; he hadn't expected Lei Yong's mid-stage Bone-Subjugation Realm to match him. After their clash, he had no time to care about Li Xiuping and could only let him fend for himself.

Hearing the voice, Deng Jiusi and Lei Yong exchanged a palm strike. Both had默契 to step back and stop fighting.

"Yuanling Late Stage!" Lei Yong stared at the middle-aged man in the sky, his expression grave.

Others heard the voice and stopped fighting as well, returning to a standoff.

But Feiyun Sect disciples were trembling, watching the fierce Wuxing Sect disciples. They looked at the scattered battlefield and corpses everywhere, Feiyun Sect's three thousand disciples had over half dead. These disciples couldn't hold back and some cried out loud.

Though everyone stopped fighting, one person was forgotten—Luo Tian, who had been in a killing frenzy. Now he seemed mindless, repeatedly stabbing with the Rending Sky Spear. His surrounding corpses piled high; no Feiyun Sect disciple dared approach him.

"Killer God!" People trembled, watching Luo Tian slaughter Feiyun Sect disciples like pigs.

Seeing Luo Tian still hadn't stopped, the man in the sky frowned and pointed his finger at him. A tangible pressure pressed Luo Tian to the ground.

"Smack!" The sound of a heavy landing echoed from Feiyun Sect's ground. A beast several zhang long appeared in people's sight.

"Earth Dragon!" Lei Yong stared at the beast again, his expression grave.

"What is this thing?" Gu Lei frowned, sensing the terrifying fluctuation from the beast. He felt if it spat a mouthful of saliva, it could kill him!

Gu Lei had been the most comfortable in the battlefield. As a poison cultivator, he suited group fights. He just needed to spread poison in crowded areas. The one who killed the most wasn't Feng Qianyu or Luo Tian, but Gu Lei himself. He was only at Body-Refining Stage Seven but had killed the most, giving him some confidence.

But when he saw this beast and the man in the sky, his confidence was crushed instantly. He trembled at the beast.

"Earth Dragon—though not a pure dragon clan, anything with 'dragon' in its name isn't easy to deal with. Though I don't know what kind of dragon this is, I do know it's stronger than a typical Yuanling Stage One." Lei Yong's face darkened, watching the man and the scaled beast.

Both gave immense pressure, especially the dragon with a bloodthirsty aura and a dragon clan's intimidation.

"Then we've killed so many people, will we return?" Gu Qianxue worriedly asked.

"Cheh, he dares? Sister, you underestimate our Wuxing Sect's authority! I dare say if he kills us all, the sect's elders will immediately come out and hunt him down. He won't even have time to commit suicide, let alone a chance at reincarnation!" Ning Qingzhu sneered, her expression calm.

Hearing Ning Qingzhu's words, Gu Qianxue relaxed and thought: a small Feiyun Sect had a Yuanling Late Stage master. How terrifying must Wuxing Sect be, which was much stronger than Feiyun Sect! It seemed Wuxing Sect wasn't just those few sect leaders.

"Respect the Sect Leader!" Deng Jiusi and other elders bowed, calling out to the man.

"Who can tell me what's happening? I've been in seclusion for two years, and now they've attacked my gate. If I hadn't emerged, maybe we'd have been destroyed!" The man's cold gaze swept over the Feiyun Sect elders.

Chapter 106: Healing
Chapter 106: Healing

Seeing the Sect Leader's furious gaze, Feiyun Sect elders were sweating. Some elders directly looked at Deng Jiusi.

Deng Jiusi was in agony; his faction's elders were almost all dead or injured, with only a few remaining unharmed. His disciple Li Xiuping was now missing.

Seeing the Sect Leader, Nan Gong Xiu's intense gaze on him, Deng Jiusi could only reluctantly recount the truth. He knew if he lied, Nan Gong Xiu would deal with him.
