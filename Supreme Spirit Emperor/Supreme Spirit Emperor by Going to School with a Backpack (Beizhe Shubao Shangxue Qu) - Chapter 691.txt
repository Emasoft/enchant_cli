The Broken Sword of Destruction was in Luotian's grasp, radiating a faint yellow glow. Luotian raised his hand and slashed downward; the golden sword aura instantly severed the two Immortal Kings in their early stage, cleaving them in half and sending their bodies crashing to the ground.

Slaughter God—Luotian had transformed into an unparalleled Slaughter God, his form flickering as he surged toward Chu Kaihe.

"Get out of my way..."

Chu Kaihe roared, his resolve unshaken. He channeled all his recovered cultivation into his long sword, unleashing a thunderous strike toward Luotian.

"You have no qualifications to face me now!" Luotian sneered, his Broken Sword colliding with Chu Kaihe's blade.

Chu Kaihe's sword shattered instantly, his body recoiling and spewing blood mid-air—his state a stark contrast to before.

The masters of the Central Three Heavens halted abruptly, their gazes trembling as they beheld Luotian. The sheer might radiating from him extinguished any desire to resist.

"Stop gawking! Join me and destroy him!" Chu Kaihe bellowed at the masters, his strength depleted beyond endurance against Luotian's current state.

Hearing Chu Kaihe's command, the masters exchanged glances before biting their lips. Their hands shimmered with divine light as they unleashed powerful martial techniques toward Luotian.

Luotian spun abruptly, his gaze locking onto the masters—causing them to fumble their techniques.

Malignant qi surged, coalescing into a black armor that enveloped Luotian: the Mourning Demon Armor.

Boom! Boom! Boom...

As the Mourning Demon Armor enveloped Luotian, the techniques struck him head-on, unleashing a deafening roar.

"Run!" Chu Kaihe seized the moment to flee—otherwise, he'd lose his chance.

The masters' attacks might wound Luotian but could never kill him. Chu Kaihe's current state was dire.

"You won't escape!" A weary voice echoed in Chu Kaihe's ears, sending a tremor through his heart as an overwhelming killing intent locked onto him.

"Divine Sword of the Heavens!"

The sword's cry pierced through the dust, materializing before everyone's eyes. It appeared behind Chu Kaihe in an instant, causing him to panic.

Boom...

In a flash, the sword aura severed Chu Kaihe, scattering him into blood mist across heaven and earth.

All eyes widened as they gazed at Luotian emerging from the dust.

"Chu... Chu's Grand Elder... is dead..." The master who had previously fawned over Chu Kaihe stammered.

"Luotian never revealed his secret technique until now; otherwise, Chu Kaihe wouldn't have lasted this long!" Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan marveled, finally grasping Luotian's plan.

At that moment, Luotian radiated malevolent qi, his body fractured and appearing on the verge of collapse. Yet his aura remained formidable.

"Third wave is ready! To you, Master Meng—hurry back! This formation can hold a while longer!" Amidst the shock, Wan Lingkong shouted toward the three battling Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan.

At that moment, two million cultivators stood motionless on the Wheel Rotation Formation, watching Luotian and his companions clash.

"Go!" Lu Zhong and Meng Wushuang exchanged a glance before unleashing their strongest attack. They had long exhausted themselves, and now that they could escape, they wouldn't linger.

"Think you can leave so easily?" Wu Li's face twisted with ferocity as he extended his hands, his palms stretching infinitely into black claws that lunged toward Lu Zhong and Meng Wushuang.

"Damn!" Lu Zhong's face darkened as crisis engulfed them. The only way to evade was to turn and fight.

A rusted Broken Sword materialized behind them, slicing through the black claws with a sword aura. The blades severed both arms, allowing Lu Zhong and Meng Wushuang to dash into the formation.

The Peng Bird spread its wings, Xiang Tianming had transformed into his true form. His massive body clashed with Fu Zhengyan's attack, rebounding into the formation and restoring Xiang Tianming's form before spitting blood.

"Luotian, hurry!" Wan Lingkong and others shouted, gripping the formation flags as they called to Luotian. Only he remained outside; if he entered, the transport would activate.

Chapter 2581: Crossing the Nine Heavens

"Go ahead—let me hold the rear!" Luotian soared into the air, standing outside the formation as he gazed at Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan.

"What?" The people inside the formation wore expressions of disbelief.

"Kid, don't think I don't know your game. With this strength, you still want to hold the rear?" Luotian smiled, glancing at Wan Lingkong holding the command flag.

"Uh..." Wan Lingkong was taken aback, his face flushing with embarrassment as he stared at Luotian.

Luotian had indeed struck Wan Lingkong's heart—he knew his formation couldn't withstand Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan's attacks. If they struck, it would collapse. Thus, Wan Lingkong decided to let the formation endure their assault for a while, hoping it would open so they could escape. As for his own life, he no longer cared.

"Go! Take them away. I'll take the Wheel Rotation Formation with me. They aren't worthy of my life!" Luotian smiled confidently, brandishing the Broken Sword of Destruction as he stared at Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan.

"Bravado! All of you, attack!" Wu Li roared, his hands moving. The sky darkened as a black ghostly face lunged toward Luotian.

Fu Zhengyan's hands danced, six ancient characters radiating divine power as they pressed down on Luotian.

Others followed suit, their final chance to destroy Luotian and the formation. The world-shattering aura of countless powerful martial techniques surged toward him.

"Luotian!" Nangong Yuching and others shouted from within the transport formation. Wan Lingkong plunged the formation flag, activating the teleportation array.

"Damn you, Wan Lingkong!" Curses echoed within the formation as Luotian ignored whether others escaped. He brandished the Broken Sword of Destruction, moving it with fluid grace.

Luotian's form flowed like a dragon, six hundred positions forming six hundred sword auras that surged upward. The world trembled as the legendary Sword Array of Destruction materialized.

As the array formed, the techniques collided with it.

"Luotian..." Nangong Yuching's eyes reddened as their final sight was Luotian unleashing the world-shattering array, swallowed by the techniques.

Boom! Boom! Boom...

The thunderous explosions continued as Luotian fought to maintain the array. Yet, it was no match for their combined attacks and two Immortal Kings' final strikes. Even with his strength and the array's might, Luotian could not withstand it.

Sword auras shattered above him as they clashed with the techniques, violent winds battering his body, forcing him backward.

Apocalypse had arrived—lightning oceans collapsed, the formation shattered, and chaotic storms swept across heaven and earth.

"Damn it! They still let the Tianyuan Sect escape!" Fu Zhengyan's face darkened, his teeth grinding. Their many strong cultivators had failed to stop one Tianyuan Sect member, and an Immortal King late stage and several early-stage ones had perished. This would be a laughingstock.

The storm raged for dozens of breaths before calming. People's gazes turned to see if Luotian had died.

Their combined attack should have killed an Immortal King late stage, but Luotian—known for countless miracles—left them doubting.

"Monster!" As people focused their gaze, someone gasped. A figure stood there, holding a bloodstained sword in one hand and the Broken Sword of Destruction in the other. His lips bled as he gazed at Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan.

"Now it's my turn!" Luotian's lips curled, sending shivers through all as he stepped forward.

With a swirl of vortexes beneath his feet, Luotian vanished from the spot and reappeared before an Immortal King early stage master. His bloodstained sword slashed downward.

Plop...

The master was cleaved in two, dying under the bloodstained sword.

After killing him, Luotian twisted his body, vanishing again to strike another Immortal King early stage master. The Broken Sword of Destruction pierced the warrior's throat, cutting him down like slaughtering chickens.

These masters, once unattainable in the Central Three Heavens, were now as easy to kill as chickens under Luotian's blade.

"If you want me dead, see how many of you will die with me!" Luotian smiled, his gaze locking onto Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan. Their cold stares made even the late-stage Immortal Kings shiver.

"He's wounded—this is the best chance to kill him!" Wu Li gritted his teeth, watching the masters who had lost their courage.

"Go to hell! You've said this before several times!" The masters cursed inwardly. Luotian had always seemed on the brink of death but still killed them.

"Divine Emperor's Finger!" Fu Zhengyan roared, his golden finger piercing through space.

"This technique is useless against me!" Luotian chuckled, though his state wasn't great. He sensed Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan's condition was also poor, while the masters were too terrified to pose a threat. Who would survive was uncertain.

"Hope our fight doesn't interfere with their transport!" Luotian thought, launching the Six轮回拳 against Fu Zhengyan's finger.

Boom...

The collision echoed again as Luotian stood firm, raising his sword to end another master's life.

"Run!" The remaining masters finally gave up, unsure if they'd be next.

They were few to begin with; now seven or eight had died. They'd endured this far, and no one wanted to die.

In an instant, the masters scattered, fleeing toward the distance.

"No one can leave—except you!" Luotian knew he couldn't stop them all, but he remembered the master who had fawned over Chu Kaihe.

"Sir!" The master was a middle-aged man, fleeing when he felt heavy breathing behind him. He turned to see Luotian smiling at him, and he shouted.

Chapter 2582: Collapse

"Calling won't help!" Luotian slashed, instantly killing the Immortal King early stage master.

Seeing Luotian kill him, others sped up, some even burning their cultivation essence to flee.

Luotian exhaled deeply, gazing at Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan remaining. Now only they were left.

"He's used his secret technique; he won't last long!" Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan exchanged thoughts, considering whether to continue fighting.

"But if we fight him now, one of us might lose a life!" Fu Zhengyan frowned. He and Wu Li weren't close; even before the Hellbound's attack on the Immortal Realm, the Nine Immortal Mountains had tense relations with some friction.

"World Treasure!" However, they soon turned their gaze to the Wheel Rotation Formation left behind by Wan Lingkong's group. Greed stirred in their hearts.

No one could resist the temptation of a world treasure, and Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan were no exception.

"Short-term alliance—first kill this kid!" In an instant, Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan soared forward, rushing toward Luotian.

Hordes of ghosts howled as Wu Li's hands moved, conjuring a ghostly figure that lunged toward Luotian.

Fu Zhengyan's hands danced, a shadow forming behind him, radiating supreme power as it punched toward Luotian.

"Still fighting!" Luotian smiled, his state wasn't great either, but he could still unleash the Sword Array of Destruction once more. He had his final secret weapon—the Wheel Rotation Formation!

Rippling black qi formed a shadowy figure, the Mourning Demon Armor. His fists clenched, six whirlpools forming on them—six轮回 forces.

Boom...

The fists collided, the Mourning Demon Armor and Fu Zhengyan's shadow both shattering. Both men recoiled.

As Luotian flew back, he gripped the Broken Sword of Destruction and slashed toward the approaching ghostly figure. His backward momentum increased, and the ghostly figure shattered.

Again!

Luotian roared, his bloodstained sword and the Broken Sword of Destruction rushing toward Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan.

Three men clashed amidst the shattered sky, their battle continuing. Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan didn't unleash full power but instead constantly blocked Luotian's attacks. If Luotian tried to retreat, they would strike.

"They want to exhaust me!" Luotian realized instantly. Their intentions were clear, and he felt a sense of crisis.

"Half an hour— I can last half an hour. Once the demon's body dissolution time passes, even a True Immortal could kill me!"

"Also, this is the Immortal Realm; reinforcements might arrive anytime!" Luotian thought, realizing he couldn't delay further. Delaying was no good for him.

"You don't want to fight? Then I'm leaving!" Luotian roared, his body moving rapidly. The Broken Sword of Destruction unleashed again, draining his cultivation to produce sword auras.

"Again that move!" Seeing Luotian unleash the Sword Array of Destruction, Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan's faces darkened. They had all combined to let Luotian survive with that array, proving its might.

Sword intent shattered the heavens—six hundred auras seemed few but weren't. When they moved, forming an array, they filled the sky with divine power, pushing toward Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan.

"Stop holding back!" Wu Li roared, his ghostly qi surging as a ghost appeared beside him. It devoured the evil qi completely, then spat out black sword auras toward Luotian's array.

Fu Zhengyan also fought desperately, his hands forming a royal mirror that radiated supreme divine power. Divine light burst from it, colliding with the sword auras.

Sword auras and divine light shattered continuously, powerful waves surging outward, echoing across the eight directions.

Time passed slowly; it lasted hundreds of breaths. Luotian's Sword Array was strong, but Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan's desperate attacks weren't harmless. The sky shattered as they finally destroyed Luotian's array, but both paid a heavy price—Wu Li's ghostly figure shattered, blood spewing from his mouth. Fu Zhengyan's royal mirror dimmed, cracks spreading across it, as if about to shatter.

"Luotian, where are you going..." Wu Li roared, knowing Luotian's array had drained him greatly. He surely couldn't fight again.

But Wu Li's words didn't finish; the word "run" seemed stuck in his throat.

"I'm not running—I think it's you who should!" A cold voice echoed in Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan's ears.

At that moment, Luotian stood there, his feet on a black disc. The disc rotated slowly, radiating supreme power.

Luotian smiled, dripping a drop of blood onto the black disc. Wind howled.

As Luotian's blood fell, the Wheel Rotation Formation spun rapidly. Storms gradually formed, a supreme aura rising—this aura made Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan's hearts tremble.

"World power! Damn it, how could he activate a world treasure like this!" Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan's eyes widened in disbelief, watching the storm sweep across heaven and earth.

Luotian stood at the storm's center, his face pale but always smiling as he gazed at Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan.

"If I were you, I'd have already fled!" Luotian chuckled lightly, but the storm's sound drowned his voice. Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan couldn't hear what he said.

Ten feet... a hundred feet...

In an instant, the storm expanded to a hundred feet. The two men regained their senses.

"Run!" Their lips twitched, without hesitation they turned and fled. This level of attack was beyond their current capacity to withstand. Even at peak condition, they'd have to fight desperately to endure it.

But they were too late; as soon as they moved, a powerful suction force from the storm pulled them toward it.

"Damn it! I need to get out!" Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan roared, their voices filled with madness. If they were pulled into the storm, they didn't know what awaited them.

Chapter 2583: Shock in the Immortal Realm

At the former site of Tianyuan Sect, the massive Tianyuan Mountain had vanished, becoming ruins. A storm贯穿 heaven and earth swept across the sky, expanding gradually outward, spreading destruction.

Outside the storm, two figures, tiny like insects, constantly resisted a powerful suction force as they flew away.

"Damn it!" Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan's faces were pale. Their speed was slow, having flown a hundred feet from the storm but matching its expansion rate—making escape impossible.

"What do we do? I can't hold on much longer!" Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan roared, their faces flushed. They hadn't expected Luotian's activation of a world treasure to unleash such terrifying power.

World power was an existence that even the Heavenly Dao's rules couldn't bind. Though not as strong as Heavenly Dao power, it could still rival it. Few could fully harness it.

Emperors were called emperors because Emperor-level cultivators possessed world power, capable of opposing the Heavenly Dao and vying with it.

Ugh...

The storm swept across several thousand feet, the scene horrifying and making Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan despair. Though it no longer expanded, the suction force remained, pulling them into the storm.

"Can't escape!" They both gritted their teeth. If they continued like this, they'd surely be exhausted and dragged into the storm. Thus, both decided to take a desperate gamble.

"I'll risk it! Luotian, if I don't die, I'll definitely kill you!" Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan roared, giving up resistance and being pulled into the storm.

At that moment, Luotian stood at the storm's center, amazed. Any late-stage Immortal King facing such an attack would feel powerless—though not dying, they'd be severely wounded.

"Bringing the Wheel Rotation Formation was the right choice!" Luotian thought, as the formation's divine light enveloped him, untouched by the storm. He stepped out of the storm.

"It's time to go!" Luotian sighed, watching the storm vanish into the distance and whether Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan had died. He soared toward Tianlan Sect.

As Luotian left, the storm continued moving, sweeping across the heavens. It didn't weaken but instead seemed to intensify, lifting mountain stones and destroying everything in its path.

Time passed slowly; it lasted a quarter of an hour before the storm gradually calmed. Two figures fell from the sky, mountain stones and vegetation falling with them.

Boom! Boom...

The two figures crashed into the ground, their eyes closed, bodies bloodied with exposed bones—clearly having suffered fundamental injuries. Their life signs were barely there.

These two had no human form left—Fu Zhengyan and Wu Li, who had barely escaped death. Whether they could survive was uncertain.

At this moment, Luotian had already left Tianyuan Sect for tens of thousands of miles. He finally felt weakness, landing on an unremarkable mountain peak. He set up several barriers and pointed his finger, creating a cave. After setting multiple barriers, he entered the cave.

Luotian sat cross-legged, weakness invading his body, a bitter smile on his face.

"Though the technique is good, its aftereffects are troublesome!" Luotian muttered, his breathing becoming heavy as he recovered his strength.

Time passed slowly; a day had gone by, and the cracks on his body had vanished.

"It should take about seven days!"

"I wonder if they successfully transported to Tianlan Sect!" Luotian felt some concern. The complete relocation of the entire Tianyuan Sect was a major event.

Indeed, after half a day in the cave, the entire Central Three Heavens and even the whole Immortal Realm spread news of Tianyuan Sect's battle.

The remaining six hundred thousand cultivators of Tianyuan Sect had teleported away, their destination unknown. Meanwhile, twenty or thirty masters and several strong cultivators from the major sects had suffered heavy losses.

Eight early-stage Immortal Kings were dead, one mid-stage, and even Chu Kaihe, a late-stage elder of Yongsheng Sect, had been killed by Luotian. Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan's soul lamps were still lit, but they had vanished.

So many people had died at the hands of one person—Guigu Sect's disciple, Luotian!

This man, once thought dead by the Immortal Realm and then reappeared, had caused another shock. This achievement was unprecedented.

Guigu's return shook the world—was this Luotian truly a variable for the Immortal Realm? Why did he never die, returning to kill so many people?

All cultivators in the Immortal Realm discussed and marveled at Luotian's strength.

"Luotian used a secret technique; he's currently weak—this is the best chance to kill him. Otherwise, only an Immortal King peak could kill him!"

"Moreover, Luotian possesses a world treasure!" As people marveled at his strength, the entire Immortal Realm received news—a message from the Nine Immortal Mountains.

This message came from Wu Li and Fu Zhengyan, but people were surprised they had sent messages to those they trusted before going silent. Their soul lamps in Guigu Sect and Donghuang Mountain had gone out.

"One person killed three late-stage Immortal Kings!" Everyone shivered.

"Luotian, I of Donghuang Mountain will never forgive you!" The elders of Donghuang Mountain roared, but to people, this was somewhat embarrassing.

After all, Luotian had already been at odds with the entire Immortal Realm. The Nine Immortal Mountains' death decree against him had already placed him on a collision course with the realm.

"Luotian and Tianyuan Sect have defected to Hell; all Immortal Realm cultivators must kill Luotian and Tianyuan Sect members without mercy!"

"Any Immortal Realm cultivator who finds Luotian must be rewarded with an upper-grade immortal artifact. Killing Luotian grants you entry into any of the major sects for life!" Several peak Immortal Kings issued a bounty. People could sense these peak Immortal Kings were desperate—Luotian's growth was too fast. If this continued, within a century, Luotian would enter the late-stage Immortal King and could fight them. With Tianyuan Sect's strength, it could shake one or even two major sects.

Chapter 2584: Fleeing to Tianlan Sect

The entire Immortal Realm erupted in chaos. Countless cultivators went mad, some drawn by the major sects' commands, others outcasts joining the hunt for Luotian. They valued more the world treasure in his possession.

But how vast was the Immortal Realm? With Luotian's intent to hide, finding him was extremely difficult.

Even so, the Immortal Realm's cultivators continuously searched for Luotian's whereabouts, hoping to ascend rapidly.

This news spread, even affecting the Immortal Realm's resistance against Hell's invasion. Some guarding positions were lost, allowing Hell to advance deeper—after all, Tianyuan Sect's battle had killed many strong cultivators.

One move triggered a chain reaction, indirectly affecting the battlefield and making Hell even stronger.

After years of war, the Immortal Realm had adapted from its initial shock. Cultivators now knew Hell wasn't a prison but an entity comparable to, or even surpassing, the Immortal Realm.

Two days passed; Luotian sat cross-legged in the cave, his aura gradually rising as he recovered to the middle stage of True Immortal.

As Luotian prepared to continue recovering, a series of disturbances appeared in the sky above his mountain peak. Three figures descended from the heavens, their presence carrying a fresh aura. All three were young in appearance.

Luotian's brows furrowed slightly as his spiritual sense shot out of the cave, sensing their presence and recognizing them.

They wore blue robes with mountain patterns, landing at the base of Luotian's mountain peak.

"Qingshan Sect?" Luotian furrowed his brows, sensing their origin and strength—only True Immortal level.

"Trouble!" Luotian muttered inwardly. After each demon body dissolution, he seemed to be bullied by those weaker than him.

"Qingshan Sect's sect master was killed by me; these disciples will definitely report to him!" Luotian pondered how to deal with these three. Though they were True Immortals, he considered them insignificant.

As Luotian mused, the three began searching the mountain.

"Senior Brother Chen, do you think this strong cultivator is truly weak?" A thin youth asked the senior True Immortal.

"If we can fight, fight; if not, run. If we find him and he's weak, we'll gain a fortune!"

"Moreover, our area has many people. Shen Suanzi calculated Luotian's position for us, betraying Bontian Sect to predict his location. He calculated this area within tens of thousands of miles, and everyone in the Central Three Heavens is coming here. Qingshan Sect is just nearby!" The senior Chen replied softly.

"Here's a barrier!" As they spoke, the three reached Luotian's cave. Their words were clear to Luotian.

"Again, Shen Suanzi!" Luotian's eyes flashed cold. He had first encountered Shen Suanzi when being chased by Ziyang Sect. The latter had used his location to track him. Later, when he entered Bontian Sect, he hadn't seen Shen Suanzi—now it was again.

"This place can't stay!" Luotian stepped out of the cave.

As he rose, a cold aura radiated from him, making the three Qingshan Sect disciples shiver.

"Such a cold aura! Senior Brother Chen, we should leave. This cave must have something!" A youth spoke, gazing at the dark cave.

"Leave? How can you rise to prominence with such courage? Luotian came from the Lower Three Heavens and still made a name. We can too!" Senior Chen spoke, his gaze cold.

"Yes, he came from the Lower Three Heavens, but he knew some people weren't worth provoking!" As Senior Chen's words finished, Luotian had already emerged from the cave. The two characters "Guigu" on his back were glaringly visible, illuminating the cave.

"Guigu Sect—Luotian!" Seeing Luotian emerge, the three disciples' faces turned pale. They immediately tried to flee.

"Didn't you want to kill me and rise to prominence?" As the three gasped, they were instantly pinned by a supreme aura, freezing in place.

"Such annoying guys!" Luotian raised his hand, a black hand grabbing them and pulling them to his front.

"You wanted to gain wealth and rise to prominence?!" Luotian smirked, launching a hundred ghosts seal to trap them. He tossed them into the cave without killing them.

"I'm getting tired of killing!" Luotian sighed, not wanting their lives. He gazed at the dense forest, needing to leave quickly. True Immortals were manageable, but if an Immortal King came, he'd be in danger.

As Luotian just left, several Qingshan Sect disciples appeared at the cave's entrance.

"Senior Brother Chen!" One disciple gasped, seeing the three trapped disciples inside the cave.

They lay there like corpses, unable to speak but breathing.

"This technique—can't be undone!" The Qingshan disciples gazed at them, surprise in their eyes.

"This is ghost qi—this is a ghost cultivator!"

"Could it be?" One youth's eyes narrowed, then widened in shock.

Luotian didn't fly into the sky but moved through the forest—his "Guigu" back was too noticeable. If he flew, his target would be too large.

This area was called Lianshen Mountain in the Central Three Heavens, not very famous. It was Qingshan Sect's territory; the sect had three million disciples and elders, ranking thirty in the Central Three Heavens. But after Luotian killed their early-stage elder, Qingshan Sect's ranking would drop.

At this moment, Qingshan Sect had mobilized one million disciples to search the mountain thoroughly, leaving no place unchecked. They all knew Luotian's importance; even the Nine Immortal Mountains had said he was weak. Killing him would secure Qingshan Sect's position.

Luotian moved swiftly, concealing his form so Qingshan Sect disciples couldn't find him.

"Everywhere has people!" After flying for half a day, Luotian felt headache. He had avoided people as much as possible, but the entire mountain was filled with Qingshan Sect disciples. He also noticed many people approaching from all sides.

Chapter 2585: Xutian Daoist

In the forest, Luotian stood under a tree's shade, his form hidden but the "Guigu" characters still noticeable.

"I need to escape quickly; otherwise, I'll be trapped here!" Luotian thought. If he were still at the middle stage of Immortal King, he'd have no fear and push through to Tianlan Sect. But his current state wasn't like that, so he had to be cautious.

Fortunately, Luotian's experience in being hunted was vast; he'd faced it countless times. Thus, he wasn't panicked but familiar with the best escape routes.

"Go!" He soared into the air, heading east toward the mountain's center. He had scouted around and knew where the least people were, as well as where Qingshan Sect and another sect's disciples intersected.

But he had wasted half a day, so the entire Lianshen Mountain was now completely surrounded. Four or five sects had encircled it, narrowing the search area.

Luotian relied on his vast spiritual sense to evade those searching for him alone, fearing loud fights would draw attention.

Time passed slowly; Luotian stopped and extended his spiritual sense, sensing the encirclement three thousand feet away.

"Three hundred True Immortals; no step-level Immortal Kings or early-stage ones—should be okay!" Luotian thought, his bloodstained sword in hand. His current strength made it difficult to activate the Sword of Destruction.

After half a day, Luotian's cultivation had reached the late stage of True Immortal. He soared upward and rushed out.

Luotian activated his Yellow River Step to its maximum, like an arrow flying forward and reaching the slow-moving group.

The sudden appearance of Luotian startled the surrounding disciples, who saw his overwhelming aura.
