This was not the most terrifying part; the most terrifying aspect was that the void rifts caused by the strong winds were increasing in number. Some areas had become impassable, and Luo Tian could only proceed after the rifts shifted slightly.

Even as Luo Tian moved cautiously, he was nearly caught in several instances. Fortunately, Xiu arrived just in time to prevent catastrophe; otherwise, it would have been more than mere injury.

Luo Tian pressed forward step by step, his face etched with determination. His gaze fixed on the dense network of jagged cracks, he murmured softly: "Three days remain. I refuse to fail!"

Chapter 411: Enlightenment

Chapter 411: Enlightenment

Luo Tian's steps were resolute, his body battered by the relentless winds. Sweat streamed down his face as he trudged forward, feeling like a common man struggling through a gale—perhaps even more so. He recalled the trials of the Five Elements Sect's selection, where he had climbed the Ascension Stair.

Back then, he had moved step by step, but this wind made breathing agonizing. Fortunately, his vital energy remained intact; if it had been lost, he would have no choice but to fight.

Behind him, a thousand zhang away, Xiu's progress was equally arduous. Though his injuries were less severe than Luo Tian’s, his form was battered and his breath ragged. His eyes locked onto the distant figure of Luo Tian, a flicker of admiration crossing his face.

Due to their cultivation methods and techniques, Xiu could sense Luo Tian’s dire state—losing three hundred years of vitality was fatal for a Reincarnation Stage cultivator. Yet Luo Tian pressed on, and even Xiu’s stoic nature stirred with quiet admiration.

"Rarely do I encounter such a formidable opponent; it almost makes me reluctant to kill you. Let us play longer!" Xiu’s lips curled into a smirk as he slowly pursued Luo Tian, maintaining precise distance to remain undetected.

The wind roared louder, drowning out all other sounds. Luo Tian replayed the map’s markings in his mind. Under these conditions, no vegetation existed—only rocks and flat ground.

"Almost there... almost there!" His steps slowed, but his eyes burned with resolve. After three grueling days of travel...

Three days later, a faint pulse of vitality stirred in Luo Tian’s perception. Though weak, it ignited his eyes with sudden brilliance.

Three days had left Luo Tian unrecognizable—his body riddled with wounds from the void rifts. Blood flowed freely, yet it was swept away by the wind before he could tend to it, leaving his injuries slow to heal.

Pain gnawed at Luo Tian’s heart; his wounds had just begun to mend, and now they were worse than before.

"But it’s worth it!" A grin spread across his face as he glimpsed the faint silhouette of a towering ancient tree.

"Hiss..." A sudden jolt sent another deep wound across Luo Tian’s arm.

He swallowed a pill, his gaze hardening as he strode toward the tree’s shadow.

"At last!" Xiu’s eyes gleamed with anticipation. Had it not been for the Purple Crimson Wind Thunder Tree, he would have already struck Luo Tian down.

"Your life is nearly over—such a pity!" Xiu whispered, his voice barely audible as he crept forward.

"Ha... I never expected to witness this Purple Crimson Wind Thunder Tree. This brat’s luck is remarkable. Once I possess his body, I’ll transplant this tree. In a century, I shall reclaim my peak!" A cold voice echoed from the void rifts.

"Yet, with my current state, success is uncertain. Those two youths seem to bear a grudge; when they destroy each other, I shall seize this moment!" The voice drifted toward the two.

Luo Tian remained unaware he was being watched. His condition had deteriorated to its limit; his vital energy, though partially restored by pills, was less than a third of its former strength. Without pills, he would have already collapsed. This was the advantage of elixirs—and why alchemists were so sought after.

But now, Luo Tian no longer cared about his wounds. His gaze was filled with awe as he beheld the colossal tree, its bark etched with swirling patterns and emitting faint purple mist.

"This is the Purple Crimson Wind Thunder Tree—truly a treasure of heaven and earth!" Luo Tian murmured.

Before him stood a tree so vast it required ten men to encircle, its branches blotting out half the sky. Thunder rumbled from its limbs, and palm-sized leaves bore an immense vitality.

Luo Tian sensed that even a few leaves could restore his lost three hundred years of vitality—but he lacked the technique to extract it. He cursed himself for not learning it from Jiang Nanxuan back then. After all, who could have predicted he’d use his own martial arts against himself?

Even more astonishing was the tree’s defiance of the gale. The wind seemed to vanish upon reaching it, leaving no turbulence or void rifts nearby.

Luo Tian retrieved his Nailing Spirit Bag. Since he had arrived, Zheng Bowen no longer needed to hide within it. He tapped the bag, and Zheng Bowen materialized beneath the tree.

Six days had passed. Zheng Bowen looked as if he’d shed a layer of skin, his face pale and lifeless.

As soon as Zheng Bowen appeared, he felt a surge of vitality. His trembling body steadied itself, and his eyes widened at the sight of the Purple Crimson Wind Thunder Tree. He gazed at the dense void rifts in the distance, admiration mingling with respect for Luo Tian’s feat.

Yet when he saw Luo Tian’s countless wounds, he understood the trials his companion had endured.

"Master Zheng, now that we’re here, hurry and gather leaves and branches. We must leave quickly—your time is limited!" Luo Tian spoke softly.

He handed Zheng Bowen a pill—a detoxifying elixir he’d found in his storage ring. Though it couldn’t cure Zheng’s poison, it would delay its effects, granting them more time. Without it, Luo Tian wouldn’t have escaped the gale valley in four days.

"Ah..." Zheng Bowen accepted the pill without hesitation, knowing this was no time for courtesy. He swallowed it.

"Ah?" Zheng Bowen’s eyes narrowed in confusion. The elixir felt different from any he’d known—its potent herbal energy slightly eased his poison, restoring a faint flush to his face.

"I’m also an alchemist! I’ve studied herbal energy deeply!" Luo Tian smiled, placing a healing pill in his mouth. His wounds began to mend at an astonishing rate.

Chapter 412: Possession

Seeing Luo Tian’s wounds heal so swiftly, Zheng Bowen was stunned. As the second son of the Wind Valley’s master, his discernment was sharp. He sensed Luo Tian’s alchemical skills were exceptional—though he merely suspected it, as he had little interest in elixirs.

"Stay here and rest; perhaps you’ll glean something from this place. After all, enlightenment beneath the Wind Thunder Tree is rare—don’t miss your chance. I’ll be back shortly." Zheng Bowen smiled and spoke.

Luo Tian nodded. He’d heard of the two treasures of the Celestial Yuan continent: "The Dragon Emperor’s Blood" and "Enlightenment beneath the Wind Thunder Tree."

While "Dragon Emperor’s Blood" referred not to the emperor’s blood but a golden-red liquid resembling dragon blood, it was equally valuable. The "Enlightenment beneath the Wind Thunder Tree" referred to this very tree, both treasures sought by cultivators across the continent.

Luo Tian’s discovery was an opportunity he could not ignore.

Seeing Luo Tian nod, Zheng Bowen pushed off the ground and leapt onto the tree. Though his energy was low, climbing a tree posed no challenge for him.

As Zheng Bowen ascended, Luo Tian sat cross-legged beneath the tree, his expression serene. Since living with Jiang Nanxuan at the Yuling Sect, he could always enter a meditative state.

Feeling the surrounding vitality, even Luo Tian felt greedy. He activated his cultivation technique, absorbing the surrounding spiritual energy while carefully observing the tree’s secrets.

But as soon as he sat down, a sudden surge of danger overwhelmed his mind, jolting him into alertness. His eyes snapped open.

Two black lights flashed—like dark lightning in the bright sunlight—and struck Luo Tian’s chest.

"Thud..." A black spear pierced his abdomen. Fortunately, Luo Tian had dodged in time; otherwise, it would have struck his heart.

Pain flared across Luo Tian’s face as the cold spear deepened his wounds, and another black light pierced his thigh.

"Ah... I told you I’d end your life!" A mocking voice echoed from afar. The man’s face was ordinary, but his eyes held a cruel smile.

"Xiu!" Luo Tian recognized the attacker, his face darkening. He cursed himself for being careless—his senses had been alert, but he’d forgotten his current injuries left him vulnerable.

"You’re a fascinating prey; I’ve never met one like you before!" Xiu sighed, as if lamenting his loneliness.

Luo Tian yanked the spear from his abdomen. As it withdrew, a blood sword surged up his stomach, turning his already pale face deathly white.

Luo Tian’s heart ached; he felt cursed in the East Domain. Since arriving, injuries had plagued him—smooth sailing in the North Domain but constant setbacks here. This felt like being cast from heaven to hell.

Hearing Xiu’s words and seeing his loneliness, Luo Tian hesitated before laughing bitterly: "You won’t kill me. You’re lonely and can’t bear to end my life!"

"Ah?" Xiu’s expression shifted, his gaze locking onto Luo Tian. Seeing the smirk in Luo Tian’s eyes, he furrowed his brow.

"I never wanted to kill you—until now. Your words upset me, so I’ve decided to send you to your grave!" Xiu spoke softly before vanishing and reappearing in front of Luo Tian.

A black fist smashed into Luo Tian’s wounded abdomen, sending him flying backward and colliding with the Wind Thunder Tree.

A trickle of blood escaped Luo Tian’s lips, his abdomen now a gaping wound that stained his clothes. Yet he smiled at Xiu, his mouth slightly upturned.

"Are you afraid of death? What are you smiling about?" Xiu asked, surprised by Luo Tian’s laughter.

"I’m laughing at you—no friends, no family, no purpose to live!" Luo Tian coughed, spitting out fragments of internal organs.

"Boom..." Xiu’s body convulsed, his eyes crimson like a demon from hell. Black mist swirled around him as he roared.

"You’ve successfully angered me! I did hesitate to kill you, but now I’ve changed my mind!" Xiu reappeared before Luo Tian and struck again.

"Crack..." The sound of something breaking echoed as Luo Tian’s chest caved in. Yet he remained unmoved, his mouth curled into a smirk as his gaze shifted from amusement to pity.

Seeing this, Xiu’s fury ignited like a beast’s. He unleashed relentless punches on Luo Tian’s body.

"Ugh..." After what felt like an eternity, Xiu stopped, his breath ragged. He gazed at Luo Tian, who still looked at him with pity.

"Crunch..." Xiu’s fists clenched tightly, the sound echoing as he stared at Luo Tian with madness. Finally, his hands stilled.

"Whether you live or die is your fate," Xiu whispered coldly before sitting cross-legged to meditate.

"Ha! Now!" A distant voice echoed from an unseen void rift, followed by a surge of gray mist that shot out like an arrow toward the unconscious Luo Tian.

The mist was impossibly fast, even eluding Xiu’s notice. It touched Luo Tian’s body and slithered into a wound.

At this moment, the Chronicles of Epochs in Luo Tian’s mind trembled slightly. A page opened, and a powerful suction pulled him into the book.

"Buzz..." The gray mist invaded Luo Tian’s body, and his soul laughed within it.

"Hah! I’ve returned—Pingtai! With this body, I can recover to the stage of Soul Convergence or even Realm Lord!" His consciousness merged with Luo Tian’s body.

Luo Tian opened his eyes slightly, gazing at Xiu meditating nearby. His mouth curled into a smirk.

"This body is damaged, but it’s no problem for me. I’ll heal in half a day. But where is this boy’s soul? Has it died?" Pingtai mused.

"It must have died. I’ll heal this body first," Pingtai muttered, his soul rushing into Luo Tian’s storage ring.

"This boy must be a treasure of some sect outside—so many elixirs, even six-star ones! And this gun is no ordinary weapon!"

A green-tinged elixir floated into the air and dropped into Luo Tian’s mouth.

"Ah?" Xiu, seated on the ground, furrowed his brow and opened his eyes. He saw an elixir fall into Luo Tian’s mouth but said nothing, resuming meditation.

"Interesting little fellow. I’ll deal with you after healing this body," Pingtai mused, smirking.

His soul surged forth, but instead of using a technique to refine the elixir, he seemed to burn his soul.

As his soul burned, Luo Tian’s battered body began to mend.

While Luo Tian and Xiu meditated—one in enlightenment, the other in healing—Zheng Bowen sat cross-legged on a branch of the Wind Thunder Tree. His face was solemn as wind energy flowed from him, momentarily calming the tree.

Three hours passed swiftly. Luo Tian suddenly opened his eyes, a lightning bolt of clarity illuminating the sky.

A dominant aura radiated from him as he smiled: "I’ve burned two-tenths of my soul to heal this body. Truly, the legendary Five Elements Body!"

Luo Tian smiled confidently, scanning his surroundings. Yet he couldn’t find the Chronicles of Epochs in his mind.

"Is this the Wind Thunder Tree? It’s truly a treasure! But it’ll soon be mine!" He gently caressed the tree, his face alight with excitement.

Pingtai, an ancient monster who had lived countless years, knew the tree’s true value. In the Ancient Era, countless masters and Soul Convergence experts had fought fiercely for it.

Pingtai understood the tree’s most precious part: the Wind Thunder Crystal Heart nestled between its roots, formed once every thousand years.

This heart’s power was unparalleled—it could grant the user wind or thunder attributes, a new and permanent trait. This was far more potent than Luo Tian’s previous conflicting three elements producing light energy.

"Having wind and thunder attributes would make this body even more perfect. But first, I must deal with this little fellow. There’s another on the tree—his body is good, but I dislike his aura!" Luo Tian opened his eyes and gazed at Xiu, who had already awakened.

"Woke up?" Luo Tian smiled faintly, his gaze calm as he looked at Xiu.

Feeling Luo Tian’s calm gaze, Xiu furrowed his brow. He instinctively sensed Luo Tian had changed—yet three hours had passed since a dying man recovered, which seemed unlikely.

"You’re not Luo Tian!" Xiu’s face turned cold, his eyes icy as he locked gazes with Luo Tian.

"Indeed, I’m not. Thanks to you, my possession was smooth. Rather than calling it possession, it’s more like you killed him and I took over his body. As a token of gratitude, I’ll let you live—but as my servant!" Luo Tian stretched his body, his gaze mocking.

"Go to hell..." Xiu said nothing more, a black spear materializing in his hand. His face was grim as he vanished into the air.

Seeing Xiu disappear, Luo Tian sneered: "I gave you a chance—you didn’t cherish it. Don’t blame me!"

Luo Tian spoke, then kicked off the ground, transforming into a swift leopard that appeared ten zhang away. He raised his fist as if striking the sky.

"Death-Ending!" His fist smashed into the void, gray mist spreading and a腐朽 aura sweeping outward.

"Good—this boy’s residual martial art is still impressive!" Luo Tian smiled.

"Boom..." A deep sound echoed as Xiu’s figure appeared, his eyes wide with shock at Luo Tian standing before him.

Chapter 413: Departure

"Your cultivation level is at the Reincarnation Peak—good. Let’s see if I can push to the Soul Convergence Stage. Reincarnation Peak is still too weak!" Luo Tian clenched his fists, a smile on his face.

Pingtai was increasingly satisfied with this body. He had once been at the Reincarnation Stage, so he could sense how much stronger this body was than his own.

Xiu’s eyes brimmed with fear. He now understood the ancient monster hidden within Luo Tian’s body. That fist had cost him two hundred years of vitality, and he was no match for Luo Tian.

He realized he needed to flee—after all, he wasn’t foolish enough to fight an impossible opponent. He was a killer, skilled in stealth and assassination. That fist had clearly targeted him; Luo Tian’s confident gaze suggested it wasn’t a coincidence.

"Rest assured, I’ll avenge your death!" Xiu whispered, gazing at Luo Tian who stood before him with disdain.

"Revenge is what I’ll do for this body’s owner!" Luo Tian laughed lowly, his form flashing like lightning to Xiu’s side. He launched another Death-Ending punch.

As Luo Tian spoke, Xiu’s feet glowed with green light. A drop of blood from his finger flowed into his mouth, replenishing his energy.

Yet even so, Luo Tian arrived before Xiu.

But as Luo Tian’s fist—wrapped in gray mist—approached Xiu, it paused for a moment at his chest.

Xiu’s mind flickered with confusion. He marveled at Luo Tian’s strength, then vanished from the spot.

"Hah... it seems this body’s original owner doesn’t want you to die! His residual will stopped me from killing you!" Luo Tian chuckled, retracting his fist.

At that moment, Xiu’s figure paused as he fled. His face bore a cruel expression; he regretted having killed Luo Tian earlier, or else this situation wouldn’t have occurred. He also secretly thanked his dual wind and darkness attributes—having absorbed the wind’s essence beneath the Purple Crimson Wind Thunder Tree, he might have otherwise been trapped here.

Seeing Xiu vanish from his powerful soul perception, Luo Tian punched the Wind Thunder Tree, producing a thunderous sound.

The noise traveled up the tree’s trunk to Zheng Bowen, who was meditating on a branch. It jolted him from his meditation.

Zheng Bowen opened his eyes, his face showing anger. He had nearly completed absorbing the wind’s essence; with a little more time, he would have mastered it. Now interrupted, his eyes held a hint of murder.

But recalling Luo Tian was below the tree and no one else was present, he furrowed his brow. His poison had been partially expelled due to the wind’s essence, and his energy had recovered to three-quarters—enough to handle any crisis. His eyes gleamed with confidence.

"Boom..." Zheng Bowen no longer climbed down but leapt directly to the ground.

"Boom..." Two deep footprints formed beneath him.

When Zheng Bowen saw only Luo Tian below the tree, his eyes flashed with reproach. His tone was cold: "Luo Tian, why did you call me down? I thought something had happened to you!"

The ancient "Luo Tian" knew Zheng Bowen’s thoughts—this was a rare opportunity for enlightenment, interrupted by him.

"I did have some trouble, but it’s resolved now. However, you’re in danger!" Luo Tian spoke as if reciting a tongue-twister, mocking Zheng Bowen.

"What?" Zheng Bowen finally sensed something was off with Luo Tian and asked in confusion.

"You carry an aura I dislike. You’re Zheng—could you be the descendant of that old man?" Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, scrutinizing Zheng Bowen.

Under Luo Tian’s gaze, Zheng Bowen felt exposed, his body trembling under a heavy pressure.

"It is indeed that old man’s descendant!" Luo Tian sneered, then launched a Death-Ending punch.

Zheng Bowen and Luo Tian were so close that despite sensing something was wrong, he couldn’t dodge. Even Xiu, who had mastered the wind’s essence, couldn’t escape Luo Tian’s speed.

Zheng Bowen felt a blur, and Luo Tian’s fist had already touched his chest.

"Damn! It’s the original owner’s residual will!" Luo Tian growled, confusing Zheng Bowen.

"Leave... I’m in a good mood today and don’t want to kill you!" Luo Tian spoke through gritted teeth, his eyes burning with fire.

He clearly remembered the man who had shattered his soul—Zheng, the old ancestor of Wind Valley. He’d been lucky to escape into a void rift and survive until now.

Now sensing Zheng Bowen was the old man’s descendant, he couldn’t kill him—this enraged Pingtai.

"You’ve possessed Luo Tian!" Zheng Bowen’s eyes flashed with madness as two hammers materialized in his hands. He now understood the truth.

"Go!" Luo Tian roared, kicking Zheng Bowen’s chest and sending him flying ten zhang away.

This kick wasn’t full-force; otherwise, Zheng Bowen would have been broken. Even so, he coughed blood, his eyes wide with shock at how Luo Tian had defeated him without using any technique.

"Boom..." Zheng Bowen fell to the ground, his eyes complex.

"One day, I’ll avenge you!" Zheng Bowen whispered, knowing he couldn’t fight now. The priority was to spread the news of Luo Tian’s possession—otherwise, trouble would be immense.

"Go!" Luo Tian glared at Zheng Bowen again, his killing intent slowly gathering. He vowed to kill him if he didn’t leave, even if it meant burning his soul again.

Chapter 414: Cultivation

Zheng Bowen’s face twisted with struggle as he glared at Luo Tian, then walked toward the wind beyond the Wind Thunder Tree.

"Zheng’s bloodline... one day, I’ll erase all Zhengs from the Celestial Yuan continent!" Luo Tian’s face darkened as he watched Zheng Bowen leave.

"Now, I’ll check if this Wind Thunder Tree truly holds the legendary Wind Thunder Crystal Heart!" Luo Tian murmured, slapping the ground beneath the tree. His eyes closed as his soul penetrated deep underground.

"Ten zhang... a hundred zhang... a thousand zhang..." The tree’s massive roots sprawled before him.

"I’ve found it!" Luo Tian smiled, spotting a glowing pearl resembling the tree’s heart on one of its thickest roots.

A powerful suction erupted from his palm, reaching the pearl. As he watched, the Wind Thunder Crystal Heart slowly ascended along the thick root, its speed increasing.

"Boom..." After an hour, a crack echoed as the crystal heart broke through the soil and landed in Luo Tian’s hands.

After a brief inspection, confirming no abnormalities, Luo Tian didn’t hesitate—he pressed the heart into his forehead.

At the moment it touched his brow, Luo Tian’s body trembled violently, shaking with power. His eyes widened in excitement. After a while, he closed his eyes and sat cross-legged, with thunderous sounds echoing from his body.

"One day... two days... three days..." Three days passed swiftly, and Luo Tian remained seated, his face solemn.

On the third day’s end, he suddenly opened his eyes. A fierce wind erupted from his body, even causing the Wind Thunder Tree to sway slightly. His eyes flashed with lightning.

"This is truly a treasure! Now this body isn’t attributeless—it’s seven attributes!" Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with confidence. He extended his hand, and seven-colored spiritual energy swirled around him like a rainbow.

"Not only that, I previously had dual water-wood attributes. I’ve mastered their essences. With the Wind Thunder Tree and Wind Thunder Crystal Heart, I’ve grasped wind and thunder essences. Now I’ve mastered four attributes! I can ascend to Soul Convergence anytime!"

"But it’s not enough. I must master the remaining three attributes. I’ll enter Soul Convergence at its peak, even surpassing Soul Convergence Stage Endings!" Luo Tian’s eyes burned with confidence.

"This boy’s treasures need re-cultivation!" Luo Tian murmured, a smirk on his face.

"Buzz..." A powerful surge erupted from Luo Tian’s storage ring, emanating a soul-pinning force from a bronze cauldron.

"Sealing Soul Cauldron! Excellent—this treasure would be top-tier even in the Ancient Era!" Luo Tian sighed, dropping a drop of blood onto it.

His soul expanded instantly, and without hesitation, seven-colored spiritual energy enveloped the cauldron, beginning to refine it.

"You and I have no connection!" A seal appeared in Luo Tian’s (now Pingtai’s) soul.

"Connection or not, it’s not your decision. Submit or be destroyed!" Luo Tian’s eyes flashed coldly, his overwhelming aura radiating.

"Leave... depart!" Ignoring Luo Tian’s words, the seal transmitted again into his mind. A repelling force surged from the cauldron, forcing Luo Tian to retreat two steps.

"Unexpected—my first battle since resurrection is against this earth-level treasure! If you don’t submit, I’ll destroy you!" Luo Tian sneered, his soul force rushing into the cauldron and burning fiercely to refine it.

But Pingtai had underestimated the cauldron. As soon as he touched his soul, his face turned pale. The cauldron seemed bottomless, absorbing his soul force.

Luo Tian had tried multiple times to claim the cauldron but failed, relying instead on its weight to strike enemies.

"One-tenth of my soul force was absorbed!" Pingtai’s face paled, but he gritted his teeth.

"I won’t believe a lifeless object can outmatch me!" He fully burned his soul force to refine the cauldron.

Soon, another two-tenths of his soul force were absorbed, and his face grew pale. He realized that if he fully refined this cauldron, it would become his greatest asset for conquering the Celestial Yuan continent. His pride also refused to give up—after all, he had once been a formidable figure across the continent.

"Three-tenths... four-tenths!" Pingtai roared internally. In an hour, his soul force had been burned to nearly four-tenths.

Pingtai’s face paled further—four-tenths of his soul force hadn’t refined the cauldron, and a bad premonition arose.

"Can’t continue—this will be dangerous. I haven’t fully merged with this body yet; I’ll refine it after merging!" Pingtai calculated.
