“Cough...” Within the Shanhai Cauldron, Luo Tian, who was pouring yellow spiritual water, nearly choked to death.

“Yichen, shut this kid’s mouth!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed within the Shanhai Cauldron as ten-colored flames surged out of the fire mouth.

“Mmm…” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s command, Dong Yichen naturally obeyed, seizing the opportunity when Gu Guanyu wasn’t paying attention to block his mouth.

…At the very moment Luo Tian began cooking himself, ten thousand miles away from the Tai Ping Hall of Yama’s Ten Palaces, the black sky tore open as a figure emerged from the void—Master Bu Tianxin, the Diviner.

Chapter 2768: Bu Tianxin Arrives

A figure in gray robes stood beneath the sky, his gaze profound as he stared toward the Luo Shengmen.

“My calamity is also yours!” Bu Tianxin murmured softly, holding a token in his hand—the Guiyu Token. It was this very token that allowed Bu Tianxin to locate Luo Tian.

“I am the one destined to restore order!” Bu Tianxin’s eyes gleamed with determination as he flew through the sky.

As soon as Bu Tianxin departed, Yang Huanyu stood at the entrance of Luo Shengmen’s black hall, his heart stirred. He stepped outside and gazed toward the direction Bu Tianxin had left.

“Truly rare…可惜,可惜!” Yang Huanyu chuckled lightly but said nothing before returning to Tai Ping Hall.

The black hall was filled with people, their expressions cold. Yet when Yang Huanyu appeared, all eyes turned to him with reverence.

“Our era is coming; Hell shall be the beginning of Luo Shengmen!" Yang Huanyu spoke softly, causing a commotion among those in the hall.

“Next target: the Equality Hall!” Yang Huanyu pointed at a map on the wall.

“Understood!” The people in the hall instantly rallied, a group of formidable forces—six experts at the peak of Immortal King level, capable of destroying heaven and earth, unifying Hell.

…At Tianhui Inn, within the Shanhai Cauldron, Luo Tian lay there as it filled with yellow spiritual water. The water roared with boiling sounds, its depths teeming with medicinal herbs being transformed into elixirs by the fierce heat. The powerful冲击 constantly battered the cauldron’s lid. Luo Tian's blood and qi surged, his formidable body absorbing the medicinal energy from the yellow spiritual water through every pore.

“Comfortable!” Luo Tian silently sighed, having spent two days within the Shanhai Cauldron. His physical recovery had accelerated by one or two times compared to before. He felt his heart beating strongly, channeling this immense power throughout his body. In two days, he had recovered faster than in the past two months, filling him with immense joy.

Dong Yichen and Gu Guanyu sat cross-legged before the Shanhai Cauldron, their auras having grown significantly. Even the aura radiating from the cauldron had greatly enhanced their cultivation.

“Elder Yichen, do you think Uncle has been in there for two days already? Even if he were refining pills, wouldn’t he have finished by now? Why hasn’t he come out yet?” Gu Guanyu spoke continuously. A day ago, Dong Yichen had released him, and though he had gained some sense, his nature soon resurfaced, making his mouth unable to stay closed.

“Don’t speak nonsense; the master is fine!” Dong Yichen glared fiercely at Gu Guanyu, who grimaced.

“Is there anyone here?” As they spoke, a voice echoed from downstairs, causing Dong Yichen and Gu Guanyu to narrow their eyes. They quickly rose and stepped out of the room, gazing downward.

“Is there anywhere I can stay?” Bu Tianxin’s eyes glowed with a faint light as he looked at Dong Yichen and Gu Guanyu.

“There’s none left; we’ve already reserved this inn!” Dong Yichen replied, gazing at Bu Tianxin standing below.

Though Bu Tianxin carried no aura, Dong Yichen and Gu Guanyu were seasoned veterans from the Nine Regions. They could sense his aura was no ordinary one.

“Still, I must stay here. I believe it’s better for you to let me!” Bu Tianxin spoke softly, stepping onto the stairs.

Tread… tread… The heavy footsteps echoed in their ears, each step making them feel their auras sink as if a mountain pressed upon them.

“You’ve truly reached the end, relying on two Immortal Kings to guard!” Bu Tianxin spoke softly.

Pfui… Blood spewed from Dong Yichen and Gu Guanyu’s mouths, their faces pale to the extreme. Their bodies emitted a crackling sound.

Bu Tianxin strode up to the second floor, his eyes gleaming as he saw the Shanhai Cauldron. “Two little brats, I have no interest in you!” He spoke softly as Dong Yichen and Gu Guanyu’s bodies floated upward, falling from the second to the first floor.

“Ah…” They cried out, trying to rise but knowing this man didn’t even consider killing them. This was an insult and also a blessing—too great a gap existed; this youth could kill them with just one glance.

After sending Dong Yichen and Gu Guanyu away, Bu Tianxin’s eyes filled with killing intent. He extended a hand, pointing it toward the Shanhai Cauldron.

In an instant, his gray fingers descended upon the cauldron, causing it to roar with a thunderous sound. The cauldron’s body caved in, transforming into a streak of light that flew out.

Boom… The entire inn collapsed with a resounding crash, the Shanhai Cauldron flying out of the inn, dust swirling.

“This cauldron is remarkable!” Bu Tianxin’s eyes narrowed slightly as he rushed through the dust toward the cauldron, landing before it. His hands moved swiftly, forging divine inscriptions.

“What’s happening?” As the cauldron shattered the inn, this powerful explosion shook Tianhui City. Everyone in Tianhui City spat blood, the overwhelming aura of an Immortal King engulfing the entire city.

Boom… Boom… Bu Tianxin continued attacking the cauldron, each strike leaving the people of Tianhui City in shock. Tianhui City was a small town; they had only heard rumors but never seen an Immortal King, as they lacked the qualifications.

Bu Tianxin’s face lit up with joy; the Shanhai Cauldron was already riddled with massive dents, losing its divine laws. Blood continuously flowed from it.

“Niangxiang!” Bu Tianxin refused to give Luo Tian even a chance to survive, for he had foreseen this as his final opportunity to kill Luo Tian—there would be no second chance.

Buzz… The divine script chains erupted, radiating infinite divine power, eight in total, wrapping around the cauldron as if pulled by an unseen force.

Crack… Crack… Finally, under the pulling force, the cauldron could not endure and shattered with a thunderous crash. A figure emerged within Bu Tianxin’s line of sight.

“Diviner!” A cold voice echoed through the heavens and earth as Luo Tian’s blood surged, his lips bleeding as he stood in the sky. Eight divine script chains wrapped around him, trapping him.

At the very moment Luo Tian appeared, Bu Tianxin’s eyes narrowed sharply; he could sense Luo Tian’s current state—like a volcano about to erupt. Once it reached a critical point, it would inevitably explode, and Bu Tianxin knew he wouldn’t be able to withstand the爆发.

Chapter 2769: Peak of Immortal King

“Ultimately, I have won!” Bu Tianxin’s hand grasped, the eight divine script chains tightened again, beginning to strangle Luo Tian.

Squeak… Squeak…

Luo Tian also felt the power of the eight divine script chains, even his current body found it difficult.

“Unsurpassed, Diviner!” Luo Tian’s lips bled but his face bore a smile. At this moment, he could move, yet he chose not to; only one opportunity remained, and Luo Tian felt it lay within Bu Tianxin. Though the eight divine script chains were powerful, they also accelerated Luo Tian’s heartbeat, his heart continuously emitting radiant light throughout his body.

“Almost there… almost there!” Luo Tian silently calculated, blood flowing from his lips.

“I don’t believe you, a half-dead man, I still can’t eliminate!” Bu Tianxin roared, spitting blood. The eight divine script chains turned red.

…More roaring echoed through the heavens and earth as nine blood-red illusions appeared at the ends of the eight divine script chains.

“My heavens!” Exclamations echoed from outside Tianhui City, which had become an empty city. Everyone rushed out of the city, fearing being caught in the crossfire.

“Master!” Dong Yichen’s face darkened as he watched Luo Tian bound, but he was powerless.

Luo Tian held his breath, not daring to breathe, for he felt that one breath would result in being strangled.

Boom… Boom… The golden heart beat violently, Luo Tian felt dizzy and his vision blurred but he persisted.

Buzz… Finally, a golden light flickered, gathering at Luo Tian’s head. At the same time, his aura erupted with a thunderous force.

Roar… Luo Tian roared, golden patterns spreading across his body. His arms swelled with power as he raised them before Bu Tianxin’s gaze.

As Luo Tian lifted his arms, the eight blood-red divine script chains shattered, and the nine blood-red illusions disintegrated around him. The heavens collapsed, the void trembled; a violent aura radiated from Luo Tian’s body. Standing proudly in the sky, his face showed excitement.

“Peak of Immortal King!” Bu Tianxin’s eyes widened in disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian clenching his fist.

“Thank you!” As Bu Tianxin was stunned, Luo Tian’s voice echoed in his ears. At the same time, a massive foot crashed down toward Bu Tianxin.

“Damn it!” Bu Tianxin cursed inwardly, his hands moving swiftly to summon a gray shield above him.

Crack… But the shield was as fragile as paper, shattering under Luo Tian’s massive foot. His black foot landed on Bu Tianxin, pinning him to the ground and crushing him into it. The thunderous sound echoed in all directions, cracks spreading around Bu Tianxin, leveling an area of ten thousand zhang. Blood spewed from Bu Tianxin’s mouth, but he immediately stood up.

“This is your calamity, and mine!” Bu Tianxin spoke, causing Luo Tian to slightly pause.

“I don’t know whose calamity it is, but I know that from today on, I will subdue everything!” Luo Tian roared, taking another step toward Bu Tianxin. The peak of Immortal King represented the highest combat power in both heaven and hell; Luo Tian naturally had the right to say such words.

“After hundreds of years, I’ve finally reached my peak—this year’s suffering was worth it!” Luo Tian’s boldness surged, his body descending with a thunderous impact.

“Wuliang!” Seeing Luo Tian descend, Bu Tianxin’s hands moved swiftly. He knew that at this moment, an Immortal King in the late stage had no chance of resisting Luo Tian. Even if he was Bu Tianxin, who could kill other late-stage Immortal Kings, it was futile.

Crash… In an instant, the great Dao roared; Bu Tianxin’s body emitted a sound of flowing water. His aura surged powerfully, instantly stabilizing at the peak of Immortal King.

“Who is he?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed slightly, sensing Bu Tianxin was no ordinary person.

To forcibly elevate one's cultivation to the peak of Immortal King—such a technique had never been seen by Luo Tian. Although the Heaven-Devouring Body Transformation could do it, its aftereffects were unbearable for Luo Tian.

“One moment—only one moment I can withstand. Either you die or I perish; today, we settle this!” Bu Tianxin sneered, holding a gray long sword in his hand. His robe fluttered as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“You’re crazy, settle your own sister!” Luo Tian cursed, his spear—Liewang—materializing in his hand.

The black spear body radiated a cold glow, its surface adorned with golden divine patterns that hummed. Luo Tian moved, thrusting the spear toward Bu Tianxin.

Bu Tianxin’s long sword erupted with power, showing no fear. For him, this was a battle to the death; if he lost, he would vanish without a trace.

Crack… Thunder clashed as the spear and sword collided in the sky, causing the entire heavens to shatter. The powerful roar echoed across all directions.

“Disperse!” Tianhui Inn was reduced to ruins under their confrontation, leaving the people of Tianhui City with chills as they fled in all directions. Dong Yichen and Gu Guanyu followed the crowd.

“Where?” In Fenggui King’s city, Fenggui King’s face showed shock. Even from afar, he could feel the tremors caused by Luo Tian and Bu Tianxin’s battle.

In an instant, Fenggui King’s city was stirred; they didn’t know what had happened but felt the heart-stirring collision sound. Fenggui King immediately took flight toward the direction of the disturbance, simultaneously sending a message to Yama’s Ten Palaces.

“Tianhui Inn—suspected peak strength combat!”

“Where is Tianhui Inn?” The Ten Yama Kings were puzzled, but they all rose and vanished from their palaces.

The current Hell was no longer as powerful as before; Luo Shengmen’s strength had exceeded their expectations. If a peak strength individual truly emerged, they must try to win him over.

It seemed fate had arranged it—just as the Ten Yama Kings’ lords stepped out, Luo Shengmen’s forces also arrived at the Equality Hall.

“Is that old man not here?” Yang Huanyu stood there, gazing at the towering Equality Hall with regret.

“Capture it first!” Yang Huanyu waved to his subordinates, and a dark mass of people surged forward like a flood.

“Damn it!” The Equality Hall’s master had just left when he received news of an attack. His face turned pale, communicating with other hall masters to return to Equality Hall. Other hall masters also changed direction toward Equality Hall.

“Damn it!” The other hall masters were furious; they didn’t need to guess who dared attack Equality Hall.

Time flowed slowly, and within less than a moment, so much had happened.

At the same time, Luo Tian and Bu Tianxin’s battle reached its climax. Luo Tian had been wounded by Bu Tianxin, and he was just entering the peak of Immortal King. Bu Tianxin had used a secret method to reach his peak, and their strengths were evenly matched.

Chapter 2770: Bu Tianxin’s Origin

On the ruins, two figures clashed. Luo Tian’s aura was overwhelming, and he grew more familiar with his current state, making his attacks stronger.

“Ah…” The Diviner’s long hair flew as he continuously swung his sword toward Luo Tian.

“I don’t believe it!” Bu Tianxin roared repeatedly, but each attack left him repelled by Luo Tian.

Ten zhang… Hundred zhang… Bu Tianxin was pushed further and further away, his aura weakening.

“Bu Tian Sword Array!” Bu Tianxin realized he had no more chances if he didn’t fight desperately. His long sword erupted with power, the heavens roaring as waves of sword energy swept across all directions toward Luo Tian.

“Desperate move!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, sensing a strong threat within the Bu Tian Sword Array. He didn’t question how Bu Tianxin had learned it, as Bu Tianxin had spent considerable time in the Bu Tian Mountains.

“Let’s see—your Bu Tian Sword Array or my Zhu Xian Sword Array is stronger!” Luo Tian clenched his left hand, and the ancient sword—Zhu Xian—materialized.

The humming sound of a powerful sword beam appeared, compensating for the broken tip. Luo Tian moved swiftly, launching waves of sword energy from his hands.

At almost the same time, both their arrays completed, and countless sword beams formed two destructive storms colliding with each other.

The Bu Tian Sword Array was created by a great sage of the Bu Tian Mountains, while the Zhu Xian Sword Array also had an extraordinary origin. The ancient sage Xu Tian once subdued all directions with the Zhu Xian Sword Array, defeating the War God刑天.

Tremendous pressure spread out; the heavens shattered, and the earth roared as the two arrays collided. The thunderous roar echoed through heaven and earth, the entire world seemingly plunging into an apocalypse. A massive vortex of void appeared, storm winds swallowing Luo Tian and Bu Tianxin, vanishing from people’s sight.

“My heavens! Who are these two men!” The people of Tianhui Inn, who had retreated far away, trembled.

“Back further!” Dong Yichen and Gu Guanyu took another step back, exiting ten thousand li away, no longer able to see the battlefield of Luo Tian and Bu Tianxin.

The storm lasted for a hundred breaths before finally calming down, the entire world in ruins, cracks appearing in the void, even revealing vast stretches of stars in the azure sky.

Cough… Cough… Bu Tianxin spat blood, gazing at Luo Tian standing in the distance. Though Luo Tian was somewhat battered, his aura remained strong.

“It’s over!” Luo Tian sneered, launching a sword beam with his hand and transforming the Liewang spear into a streak of light. He vanished from the spot with his spear.

“I can’t accept it!”

“Grandfather, you’ve been unfair to your descendants!” Bu Tianxin roared, his voice filled with anguish. His eyes were crimson as he brandished his sword before Luo Tian’s beam shattered.

However, Bu Tianxin managed to block the beam but couldn’t stop the piercing spear wrapped with golden divine patterns, which pierced his body.

Pu…

Luo Tian appeared before Bu Tianxin, eyes cold and unfeeling toward him. The Diviner had helped the forces of Zhong San Tian to calculate and oppose Luo Tian, always being his enemy. Because of the Diviner, Luo Tian had escaped death several times. Now, Bu Tianxin must die.

Bu Tianxin spoke, blood flowing from his mouth, his aura rapidly declining as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“I’ve ultimately lost, but I didn’t lose to you—I lost to my family’s ancestor’s choice!” Bu Tianxin spoke, his voice filled with anger.

“What does it have to do with your family’s ancestor?” Luo Tian sneered, launching a fist strike that unleashed six轮回 of destruction upon Bu Tianxin.

Bu Tianxin’s body was thrown back, repelled tens of thousands of zhang before stopping. His aura had dropped to the middle stage of Immortal King, no longer posing any threat to Luo Tian.

“The Guiyu Token is my family’s treasure; what does it have to do with your ancestor?” Bu Tianxin roared, his eyes filled with hatred.

“Huh?” Luo Tian slightly paused, gazing at Bu Tianxin, forming a guess in his mind.

Who was the Guiyu Token? Everyone in the celestial realm knew it belonged to Guiyu Zi. Luo Tian suspected Bu Tianxin had an 80% chance of being a descendant of Guiyu Zi.

Thinking of Guiyu Zi, Luo Tian’s heart shuddered; although he was at the peak of Immortal King, he still fell far behind Guiyu Zi, who was the last emperor of heaven.

Peng… Finally, Luo Tian gritted his teeth and struck Bu Tianxin with a palm, turning him into blood mist. However, he extended his hand to capture Bu Tianxin’s soul.

Luo Tian didn’t want to kill Bu Tianxin, but since he was a descendant of Guiyu Zi, if he truly killed him, Luo Tian felt something would be wrong. Guiyu Zi was too mysterious; unless forced, he didn’t want to provoke him or have any connection with him.

“Seal!” Luo Tian’s hands moved swiftly, casting the Hundred Demons Seal onto Bu Tianxin’s soul, completely sealing him.

Bu Tianxin’s storage ring also fell into Luo Tian’s hands; his formidable spiritual sense broke through the ring’s seal, revealing its contents to him.

“Guiyu Token!” Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with divine light, his mind moving—another Guiyu Token embedded within his body also responded. The token vanished into the back of Luo Tian’s body.

“Go!” Luo Tian extended his hand, grabbing Dong Yichen and Gu Guanyu, taking the two boys out of Tianhui Inn’s sight.

The people of Tianhui Inn looked at Luo Tian and the two boys leaving with reverence, but when they saw Tianhui Inn had become ruins, their eyes showed sorrow.

“What is that?” However, as people gazed at Tianhui Inn, they slightly paused.

“Treasure!” Someone exclaimed, seeing shiny objects on the ground within the ruins—hard to notice without careful observation.

“Guiqi Stone, Guijing!” In an instant, the people of Tianhui Inn erupted in chaos, rushing toward the city to search for Guiqi Stone and Guijing.

“Uncle, am I now able to walk proudly, announcing your name?” Gu Guanyu’s eyes sparkled with excitement as he looked at Luo Tian.

“Announce it, don’t fear being killed—just announce…” Luo Tian was speechless at this boy, slapping him on the head.

Luo Tian led the two boys flying beneath Hell’s sky, pondering how to handle Bu Tianxin’s soul.

As Luo Tian flew, a figure approached him, causing him to slightly pause before his eyes showed a smile.

“Fenggui King!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered slightly, his demon wings spreading to increase speed. In an instant, he appeared before Fenggui King without hesitation, slapping him down.

Chapter 2771: Reunion

“Who!” Upon his appearance, Fenggui King was startled. Luo Tian’s speed was too fast; even Fenggui King hadn’t reacted in time.

“Long time no see!” A cold voice echoed in Fenggui King’s ears, and a massive hand, obscuring the sun, appeared above Fenggui King. His face turned pale as he endured the overwhelming aura of an Immortal King peak.

Peng… In an instant, Luo Tian’s massive hand pressed down on Fenggui King, like swatting a fly. Fenggui King was thrown from the sky and crashed into the ground.

Boom… Boom… Fenggui King’s body was cracked, his eyes filled with disbelief. From the moment he appeared to strike, Fenggui King hadn’t seen Luo Tian’s form and was immediately crushed.

“You’ve always wanted to kill me, haven’t you?” Luo Tian’s face bore a smile as he gazed at Fenggui King.

Luo Tian had killed Fenggui King’s son, Wang Heng, and Fenggui King had harbored resentment. He had secretly cooperated with the Guiwang to take actions against Luo Tian.

“Luo!” Fenggui King’s face showed disbelief, not expecting that the Immortal King peak was Luo Tian.

“Die!” Luo Tian sneered, without hesitation, turning his hand to strike Fenggui King.

This was an opportunity to kill Fenggui King; if Fenggui King had remained in Fenggui King City, protected by the techniques left by past Fenggui Kings, Luo Tian might have faced difficulty. But outside, Fenggui King was just meat on a chopping block for Luo Tian to slaughter.

“You dare! If you harm me, the Yama’s Ten Palaces won’t…” Fenggui King roared, but before he could finish, his body was instantly turned into blood mist.

“The Yama’s Ten Palaces will have their own problems!” Luo Tian sneered, and during his flight, he received news that Tai Ping Hall had been attacked.

“Yang Huanyu!” Luo Tian whispered, and he casually destroyed Fenggui King’s soul, gazing at the distance.

Although Luo Tian had reached Immortal King peak, he still feared Yang Huanyu. He hadn’t expected Yang Huanyu to have become so powerful, seizing Tai Ping Hall and Huang Hall, then attacking Equality Hall.

“I should go check Fenggui King City first!” Luo Tian spoke, feeling Hell was now a place of turmoil. Though Fenggui King City was safe, Luo Tian still wanted to bring Su Dan and her son, as well as Fenggui King, under his protection. Now he had the strength to protect them both.

Casually destroying Fenggui King, Luo Tian took flight toward Fenggui King City.

During his flight, waves of energy rose from his back, making Luo Tian’s eyes serious.

“Is it ready?” Luo Tian muttered softly, sensing the five Guiyu Tokens had fused together.

“Yu Ren!” Suddenly, Luo Tian’s mind filled with incantations—The Yu Ren Scripture.

“Can it influence one's mind?”

“If one encounters a weak person, the Yu Ren Scripture can directly make them submit and become his slave!”

“Even strong individuals are influenced by the Yu Ren Scripture; once affected, they fall behind.” Luo Tian marveled at this scripture, which seemed trivial but was actually formidable.

“How does the effect of 'Yu' work?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed anticipation; now he only needed one more Guiyu Token to complete six, then he could learn the Yu Scripture.

“Uncle, why are you smiling so lewdly?” Gu Guanyu looked at Luo Tian and spoke out, but was immediately slapped back.

Time flowed slowly; all forces in Hell were watching the war at Equality Hall. If Luo Shengmen won, they would dominate Hell without any rival.

Luo Tian flew with Gu Guanyu and Dong Yichen, listening to the news from Equality Hall but had no intention of interfering.

…Outside Fenggui King City, two battered figures were thrown out, their eyes filled with anger.

“Two Immortal Kings? How dare you oppose us Liu Family! You must have eaten a bear’s heart and a tiger’s gall!” Several people of late Immortal King stage wore contempt, gazing at the battered two.

“Go away; don’t let me see you again. This time, it’s because of your sister, but next time, you won’t be so lucky!” A servant spoke.

“One month later, you can also come; after all, I am Liu Family’s son-in-law. You are also family members, hah!” A thirty-year-old youth laughed loudly, his eyes full of mockery as he gazed at the two.

“Being chosen by my son is their fortune; go away, and come back dressed properly next month!” The youth sneered.

“I’ll fight you!” A roar echoed, and a sturdy young man shouted, rushing toward the Liu Family’s people like an enraged beast.

If Luo Tian were here, he would recognize these two as Luo Li and Zheng Yao.

The one rushing out was Zheng Yao, with early Immortal King stage cultivation, charging like a madman toward the youth.

Peng… Zheng Yao came fast but left just as quickly; the youth merely raised his hand, and Zheng Yao spat blood before being thrown back.

Buzz… The void trembled as an invisible hand appeared behind the youth, striking him fiercely.

Although the void hand was powerful, it only made the youth take a few steps forward and his qi shook.

“Don’t you dare seek death!” The youth’s face darkened, a flicker of killing intent passing through him. However, recalling Liu Family’s son’s instructions, he took a deep breath and suppressed it.

“My father is Luo!”

“Release my sister and my master, or my father will destroy the entire Fenggui King City!” Luo Li stepped forward, his body radiating an upper-class aura that made the youth feel some discomfort.

“Luo?” Hearing Luo Li’s words, the youth instinctively shivered. He remembered the figure who had once intimidated Fenggui King. At that time, he was just a laborer; the entire Fenggui King City had almost been overturned by Luo Tian.

“Dare to claim kinship? Do you know where this is?” The youth sneered. “Luo is our Fenggui King City’s son-in-law, the great husband of Fenggui King!”

“Why did you come to spread lies in Fenggui King City?”

As the youth prepared to strike them again, several figures appeared at the city gate, causing the servant to stop abruptly.

“Seems like it!” Seeing the confident young man in black robes walking ahead, the Liu Family servant instinctively looked at Luo Li standing nearby.

Luo Su, the son of this generation of Fenggui King, the pride of Fenggui King City. At a young age, his cultivation had reached the peak of True Immortal.

“Master Luo Su!” Respectful voices echoed from the city gate as several figures bowed to Luo Su. Luo Su gazed around before spotting Luo Li standing there, though battered, his aura was extraordinary. Their eyes met, and Luo Su’s body slightly trembled.

Chapter 2772: Killing to the End

Their eyes met, and both Luo Li and Luo Su felt a pull within their blood.

“What’s happening?” Luo Su gazed at the youth who had knocked Zheng Yao down, recognizing him as a servant of the Liu Family in Fenggui King City. He had long followed Liu Family’s son.

“Report, Master: These two are falsely claiming kinship. He is your father’s son; we struck them to teach a lesson!”

“Who doesn’t know that Luo only has you as his son? Any person in Fenggui King City would be angry!” The Liu Family servant quickly spoke, not daring to reveal the truth.

The Liu Family had some influence in Fenggui King City but was merely a subordinate force. Everyone knew that the current Fenggui King would severely punish such matters; if encountered, it would be a big trouble for the Liu Family.

“Ah?” Luo Su looked at Luo Li, and although there was a moment of familiarity, his goodwill vanished instantly upon hearing the Liu Family servant’s words. His gaze turned unkind toward Luo Li and Zheng Yao.

“Expel them!” Luo Su spoke, though angry, he decided not to计较 with this youth who looked so much like him.

“Wait!” As Luo Su’s subordinates prepared to act, Luo Li spoke out.

Luo Li had already determined that this Luo Su was his younger brother. Though he wasn’t as strong as Luo Su, his mindset was far superior to Luo Su’s.

Luo Li knew his father Luo Tian well; although he was disciplined, even heroes have their weaknesses. His several mothers were examples of this.

“What’s it?” Luo Su frowned slightly, his gaze showing impatience toward Luo Li.

Zheng Yao, though honest, could also deduce something.

“What a brother! You’re so talkative…” Zheng Yao muttered, watching Luo Su.

“Who’s your brother? Don’t you dare call him that again; I’ll tear your mouth apart!” Luo Su’s subordinates shouted.

“I’m not your brother, but these Liu Family people have captured someone important to you. If you don’t save them, you’ll regret it for life!” Luo Li spoke softly; at this moment, their strength was low, and the only one who could save Luo Xiting and Dong Yan’er was Luo Su.

“Who?” Luo Su, being young, had instinctively believed Luo Li’s words and felt curiosity.

“You’re still naive, kid!” Luo Li smiled lightly, gazing at Luo Su as if looking at his younger self.

“Ask them!” Luo Li pointed to the Liu Family servant, causing the servant to pause in shock.

“Damn it! You dare provoke Master Luo Su and our Liu Family? You’re seeking death!” The Liu Family servant roared, panicking and attempting to kill Luo Li and Zheng Yao.

However, this behavior only confirmed their nervousness; even though Luo Su was young, he could see through it.

“Wait…” Luo Su spoke, and his subordinates moved to block the Liu Family servant.

At this point, even if Luo Su was naive, he could see the problem. He gazed at those Liu Family servants, who were young but had authority.

“….” The youth who had knocked Zheng Yao down broke out in cold sweat.

“!” Before he could finish speaking, a knife was placed at his neck.

Having experienced being captured before, Su Dan and the old Fenggui King had taken Luo Su’s safety very seriously. His side never left him, and they were all strong figures from Fenggui King City.

“Y-yes… y-yes!” The youth quickly spoke, recounting the entire incident.

“People from the world? They ended up here and were captured?” Luo Su quickly understood the situation, his face darkening.

“Third Uncle, go with people to Liu Family and bring them out; let them leave!” Luo Su spoke softly before turning and leaving.

“Understood!” A middle-aged man pulled the Liu Family servant, following Luo Su out of Fenggui King City.

“Luo Li, your younger brother is quite capable; he just lacks experience. After some training, he’ll become a formidable figure!”

“Are you really not going to acknowledge him?” Zheng Yao asked, watching Luo Su and his group enter Fenggui King City.

“How can I acknowledge him? My older brother hasn’t even reached my younger brother’s strength; I have no face to acknowledge!” Luo Li sighed, standing outside the city waiting.

Time flowed slowly; a moment passed, and several figures emerged from Fenggui King City. Two women caught the attention of most people.

“Go!”

“From now on, learn to watch your eyes!”

“This is only in Fenggui King City; if it were elsewhere, you would have been done for!” The middle-aged man called Third Uncle spoke to Luo Li and Zheng Yao.

“Thank you!” Luo Li and Zheng Yao were overjoyed, seeing that Luo Xiting and Dong Yan’er were safe. They sighed in relief.
