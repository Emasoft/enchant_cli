The scene was profoundly awe-inspiring—over a dozen old men bowing respectfully to a young man. An ordinary person witnessing this would have been stunned into silence.

"Come out..." Luotian ignored the several elders and roared toward the back mountain of Longya Pavilion, his Original Power coalescing into a massive hand that smashed toward the cave where the elder sat.

It seemed the elder sensed Luotian's arrival. He opened his eyes and murmured, "Luotian!"

"Boom..." The elder's cave was instantly shattered by Luotian's strike, countless stones bursting out and colliding with the surrounding cliffs.

"Old dog, still trying to flee!" Luotian gazed at the dust cloud obscuring his vision with a deep gaze, sneering as he extended a finger.

At the moment Luotian's fingertip shot out, a crimson mist scattered from the fog. Simultaneously, an elder's body emerged from the haze, disheveled and bloodied, his chest pierced by a black hole, appearing horrifyingly grotesque.

"Luotian, you!" The elder was evidently terrified beyond measure. After several days of recuperation, he had barely recovered to the level of a Single-Origin Supreme Being. The three of them had once escaped by burning all their Original Power, yet even so, they were fortunate Luotian hadn't pursued them. Now, the elder never imagined Luotian would so ruthlessly chase him to Longya Pavilion.

"What about me? Didn't I say before: if others don’t provoke me, I won’t provoke them. But if they provoke me, I’ll eradicate them completely!" Luotian lifted the elder in his hand, a cold smile on his face as he spoke.

"Mercy! The entire Longya Pavilion is yours!" The elder, now utterly terrified, gazed at Luotian with pleading eyes.

"Better late than never. Even Shang Cang Mang and Jin Yongsi didn’t attack me. What confidence do you have to strike at me?" Luotian snorted, smashing the elder with a single palm. The elder’s three weak souls emerged in a flash, eyes brimming with intense resentment—but not at Luotian, but at Jin Yongsi. Had Jin Yongsi not ignored him, the elder wouldn’t have met this fate.

"Remember to find a master in your next life. Open your eyes!" Luotian sighed, snatching the three souls back and crushing them into wisps of ash between his fingers.

The people of Longya Pavilion grimaced. A Grandmaster who had lived for countless years was slain so easily by a youth—this was beyond their comprehension.

"Luotian, your vengeance is fulfilled. Our Grandmaster is dead. You may leave now!" A burly man of Six-Origin Supreme Beings, his face flushed red with anger, addressed Luotian.

This man was a staunch supporter of Longya Pavilion’s Grandmaster. He had previously advocated fighting Luotian, but now, seeing Luotian ruthlessly kill the Grandmaster, he was enraged.

"Boom..." Before anyone could speak, the middle-aged man instantly turned into a mist of blood, splattering onto those nearby.

"This..." The shock was palpable. Several Six-Origin Supreme Beings of Longya Pavilion were stunned, their eyes wide with fear as they gazed at Luotian. This devilish man was terrifying beyond measure; his aura left no room for resistance. The middle-aged man had only shown hostility, and he was immediately obliterated.

"Submit or die. I dislike idle chatter!" Luotian’s cold voice echoed in their ears, causing their bodies to tremble.

"I choose submission!" An aged Six-Origin Supreme Being spoke up, bowing respectfully to Luotian.

"I also choose submission!" Others followed suit, bowing to Luotian, fearing hesitation would result in their deaths.

In an instant, every elder and disciple of Longya Pavilion bowed to Luotian, their submission resounding through the heavens.

"Swear blood oaths of eternal loyalty!" Luotian was not lenient toward them, his voice echoing like a demon king’s—cold and merciless.

Upon hearing Luotian's words, the entire Longya Pavilion fell silent. Yet sensing Luotian’s increasingly frigid gaze, they reluctantly swore blood oaths.

Luotian nodded in satisfaction, his expression softening. After all, with sworn blood oaths, these people would never defy him.

"Good. The rest stay here. You three Six-Origin Supreme Beings, come with me to check the other two sects!" Luotian’s tone carried amusement as he led three Six-Origin Supreme Beings toward the next sect.

The other two sects were of similar strength to Longya Pavilion. Their Grandmasters had also been severely wounded and escaped, their cultivation levels plummeted significantly. Under Luotian’s power, they had no resistance and were swiftly eliminated.

The only unexpected event was one sect. Perhaps due to the Grandmaster’s good fortune, the entire sect fiercely resisted, forcing Luotian to waste considerable time. That sect was subsequently erased from the Four Sacred Star Domains forever.

In that battle, Luotian had acted like a war god, crushing over two million disciples and elders. The sect’s mountain was shattered by one palm, leaving Luotian's three Six-Origin Supreme Beings in awe, secretly grateful they hadn’t clashed with Luotian.

As for the other sect, like Longya Pavilion, after the Grandmaster’s death, all others swore blood oaths and submitted to Luotian.

Luotian took the two sects’ Six-Origin Supreme Beings to the Tianyuan Continent, leaving two of them to protect Jiang Yimeng’s safety and manage the affairs of the two sects. Then, Luotian hurriedly left Tianyuan Sect with the remaining thirteen Six-Origin Supreme Beings.

After departing from Dongping Continent, they flew northward into the Four Sacred Star Domains. Luotian’s target was Hulao Star, which he had once extorted from Shang Cang Mang.

Traversing the endless star rivers, Luotian’s gaze held anticipation. How many formidable warriors did Hulao Star hold? If he could subdue them, it would become a terrifying force.

Due to the distance, even Luotian’s strength required nearly seven days to travel from Dongping Continent to Hulao Star. Add the thirteen Six-Origin Supreme Beings, and their speed was significantly slower.

They traveled slowly for three days before stopping. A black ship blocked their path nearby.

"This is the warship of the Star River Four Thieves!" A Six-Origin Supreme Being, his face pale with fear, exclaimed as the ship approached.

"Shh..." Upon hearing the Six-Origin Supreme Being’s words, everyone except Luotian inhaled sharply, their faces contorted with disbelief.

"Star River Four Thieves?" Luotian’s eyes narrowed in confusion, then suddenly gleamed with realization. He gazed at the ship radiating terrifying pressure.

Chapter 811: Star River Four Thieves

Under endless stars, Luotian led thirteen Six-Origin Supreme Beings, their faces grim as they gazed at a massive fleet approaching them.

The fleet numbered about a hundred ships. The lead vessel was colossal, obscuring the sky like a small continent. A banner bearing a skull head fluttered without wind, radiating terrifying waves. Dark Original Power emanated from the banner, enveloping the ship.

The ship’s material appeared ordinary, but Luotian was certain even his full power could not damage it—only shaking it slightly.

Behind the ship, dozens of smaller vessels followed in formation. A strange aura rippled between them, making the starry void unnervingly silent except for the banner’s rustling.

Luotian, newly arrived in the Four Sacred Star Domains, knew little about it. Though he had some knowledge of its factions, he was unaware of the Star River Four Thieves’ true nature.

Yet from the Six-Origin Supreme Beings’ terrified gazes and the ship’s ominous waves, Luotian understood this group was no easy foe.

"The Star River Four Thieves are the largest bandit organization in the Four Sacred Star Domains. Legends say their four leaders possess immense power, having committed crimes beyond the Four Sacred Star Domains and even other star realms," one Six-Origin Supreme Being whispered into Luotian’s mind.

"They roam the cosmos in warships, plundering indiscriminately. No one is safe—be it individuals or sects. Their most famous act was robbing a joint transport of four major sects."

"Such an incident naturally enraged the Four Sacred Star Domains’ top factions. Four sects dispatched several Seven-Origin Supreme Beings with countless warriors to hunt the Star River Four Thieves. The result? They were all slaughtered, leaving no survivors."

"That battle stained several continents with blood, countless Supreme Beings fell. Even those Seven-Origin Supreme Beings didn’t escape."

"That battle was the Star River Four Thieves’ rise to fame. From then on, their name spread across the Four Sacred Star Domains. Even Shang Cang Mang and Jin Yongsi led campaigns against them, but the matter was left unresolved. This solidified their status in the Four Sacred Star Domains."

No need for Luotian to ask. A Six-Origin Supreme Being trembled as he relayed the Star River Four Thieves’ history into Luotian’s mind, furrowing his brow.

"Time has passed. The Star River Four Thieves haven’t appeared for ages. Some say they’ve moved to other star realms; others claim they were annihilated by a void vortex. Who knew they’d reemerge in the Four Sacred Star Domains? If this spreads, it will stir up massive chaos. Sects will tread carefully," a senior Six-Origin Supreme Being sighed, gazing at the approaching ship.

Luotian didn’t let them flee. They had already sensed him. He even saw thousands of black-cloaked figures standing rigidly on the ship, a grim aura spreading across the starry void.

As they drew closer, Luotian finally discerned the scene at the ship’s bow. He inhaled sharply.

Three middle-aged men stood there, cloaked in black. Three terrifying waves radiated from them.

Behind them, about ten thousand people stood coldly, like a wolf pack. Each eye glowed with icy light.

What stunned Luotian most was their strength: two of the three were Seven-Origin Supreme Beings, while the front man was an Eight-Origin Supreme Being—equal to him.

Though this alone wouldn’t scare Luotian, he knew their Original Power was likely similar to his. The front man’s aura gave him a strong sense of danger.

Behind them, the ten thousand black-cloaked figures were equally terrifying. The weakest was a Three-Origin Supreme Being; thirty Six-Origin Supreme Beings were present, and even seven-origin Supreme Beings like Longya Pavilion’s former Grandmaster numbered around eight.

"Such strength could rival any of the Four Major Sects!" Luotian muttered, standing still and waiting for their move.

"Hey, a fellow Eight-Origin Supreme Being. You didn’t run at first sight! Interesting!" One of the Seven-Origin Supreme Beings spoke, a smile on his face as he addressed the other two.

"Second Brother, do you feel like stretching your limbs?" The other Seven-Origin Supreme Being teased the front man.

"The kid isn’t simple!" The front man frowned slightly, gazing at Luotian through the void.

At the same time, Luotian’s gaze met the man’s. Their eyes flashed with thunderous sparks, an invisible tension between them.

"Interesting," Luotian sighed, his spear "Rending Sky" humming. If the opponent attacked, he would make them pay dearly.

Similarly, as Luotian drew his spear, a green lightning bolt materialized before the man. He grabbed it, and it transformed into a long sword.

"Lightning Attribute Original Power manifested as an object. This person’s comprehension of Lightning Attribute is truly absurd!" The Six-Origin elders behind Luotian marveled, watching the man on the ship wielding a lightning sword.

In an instant, Luotian and the man vanished from their spots, appearing in the void. Thunder cracked as a lightning bolt split the sky. Their figures reappeared before everyone’s eyes.

Spear and sword clashed, their eyes blazing with fire. They retreated to their original positions.

"Too fast! Their speed is incredible. I didn’t even see Luotian disappear!" A Six-Origin Supreme Being marveled, gazing at Luotian.

"Second Brother?" The two Seven-Origin Supreme Beings looked puzzled, gazing at the man. They noticed his hands trembling slightly and fissures on his palms.

Luotian fared a little better, but his hands were still numb. He clenched them to regain sensation.

"Who are you? I don’t recall a person like you in the Four Sacred Star Domains," the man asked, his voice carrying authority—a long-standing dominance over life and death.

"You?" Luotian didn’t answer but countered with a question.

"I’m Li Tianzhi. Remember me; next time we meet, it won’t be so easy!" The man smiled, stepping on the ship’s deck. The vessel rumbled as it passed Luotian and his group.

"I’m Luotian! Next time, maybe it won’t be so easy!" Luotian called out, his voice echoing through the stars, causing Li Tianzhi to pause.

"Second Brother, we’re leaving?" The two Seven-Origin Supreme Beings asked, their faces filled with disbelief.

For years, the Star River Four Thieves had been feared across the Four Sacred Star Domains and even other realms. Now, their Second Brother had merely fought a youth once and chose to retreat. This was the second time in years they’d seen such a situation. The first had been when Li Tianzhi met the Star River Four Thieves’ leader, that terrifying man.

"First, find the leader. This person isn’t simple. If we fight, we’ll lose half of us!" Li Tianzhi whispered, a streak of blood on his lips.

"Bloodied!" Seeing the blood on Li Tianzhi’s lip, the two Seven-Origin Supreme Beings were stunned. They hadn’t expected anyone of their level to wound Li Tianzhi.

Though the injury wasn’t severe, it proved Luotian’s strength. Instantly, the entire ship crew was puzzled—what was this Luotian? He had wounded their Second Leader.

Luotian stood still in the void, watching the massive ship depart. He wore a contemplative expression before shaking his head: "The universe is vast, filled with ruthless people. Li Tianzhi is a genius too. If he fought desperately, even I would pay a heavy price!"

Behind him, the thirteen Six-Origin Supreme Beings sighed deeply, their faces filled with admiration as they gazed at Luotian, much younger than themselves.

Surviving the Star River Four Thieves’ fleet was rare in the Four Sacred Star Domains. They hadn’t expected Luotian to be so powerful that even the Star River Four Thieves feared him. Instantly, they felt joy in following Luotian.

With such achievements at his age, Luotian’s future was boundless. Following him would bring immense benefits.

"Alas, where have I spent my years?" An elder rubbed his beard, gazing at the youthful Luotian.

The others nodded in agreement upon hearing the elder’s words.

"Ha, enough. I’ll help you all improve your strength later. Our main task now is to head for Hulao Star!" Luotian comforted them, then vanished as a long rainbow, leading everyone northward into the Four Sacred Star Domains.

Chapter 812: Arrival at Hulao Star

The northernmost black continent of the Four Sacred Star Domains. Though it appeared ordinary, an eerie aura radiated from it. A massive array surrounded the continent; anyone knowledgeable would be astonished by its terror, even shocking Supreme Beings.

The black continent exuded a rotten scent. Even within the array’s protection, its oppressive atmosphere seeped out.

At this moment, Luotian and thirteen Six-Origin Supreme Beings stood in the void, their faces filled with awe as they gazed at the black continent.

Hulao Star, a prison-like existence in the Four Sacred Star Domains. After days of travel, they finally arrived.

Luotian frowned slightly, sensing an unsettling feeling from Hulao Star. The black continent seemed like a gaping maw ready to devour people.

Luotian trusted his instincts, which had saved him from danger multiple times. Yet the thirteen Six-Origin Supreme Beings behind him seemed unaffected, their faces filled with curiosity.

"Let’s go!" After a brief hesitation, Luotian took out four tokens given by Shang Cang Mang and infused them with Original Power.

"Buzz..." The four tokens hummed, summoning the Four Sacred Beasts’ illusions. They protected the group as they passed through the array and entered Hulao Star.

Upon entering, their faces grew even more shocked. The continent felt barren.

The land was desolate, shrouded in gray. No signs of life underfoot—only a few withering grasses swaying in the wind.

More shocking was that as soon as they entered, a powerful sealing force surged into their bodies, preventing their Original Power from circulating.

"This..." One elder’s face showed concern. They knew it was the array’s doing.

To prevent prisoners from escaping, all inmates’ Original Power were sealed. Otherwise, they’d find ways to flee. Hulao Star was so barren that even Original Power was weaker than on the Tianyuan Continent. For Supreme Beings, it was nearly useless—improving strength here was as hard as climbing the sky.

"Relax. We’re different from those prisoners. Once we complete the交接 (handover), we’ll find a way to remove this seal!" Luotian comforted them, gazing at the massive city ahead.

Hulao City, the only city in Hulao Star. Its people were either prisoners or jailers.

Without Original Power, their speed dropped significantly. It took a day to reach the black city.

Luotian confirmed Hulao City was the largest he’d seen, even surpassing many sects.

Tall walls still held powerful arrays. Over a hundred Intermediate Supreme Beings patrolled the skies around the city.

"Who are you?" A young Intermediate Supreme Being in the sky noticed Luotian and asked coldly.

"Luotian!" Luotian answered, unsure if the youth was from one of the Four Major Sects. He nodded inwardly.

Perhaps due to environment or long-term interaction with prisoners, Luotian sensed a grim aura on the hundred Intermediate Supreme Beings. This grimness was familiar—like having killed someone higher than oneself, and not just once.

Hearing Luotian’s name, the young Intermediate Supreme Being scrutinized Luotian and his elders, a playful expression on his face.

"Why do you claim to be Luotian? Come here so I can verify your identities!" The youth landed, extending a hand to grab Luotian.

Seeing the youth summoning an Original Power hand, Luotian immediately understood he was from Zhuque Sect or Baitu Sect.

"Can you even use Original Power?" Luotian raised an eyebrow, seeing the youth attack but not overly concerned.

"An Intermediate Supreme Being dares to reach for a Supreme Being? You’re bold!" The thirteen Six-Origin Supreme Beings behind Luotian showed anger.

In Hulao Star, such a lowly Intermediate Supreme Being would be crushed by their breath. Now this youth dared to attack them, though they had submitted to Luotian, they were Six-Origin Supreme Beings and couldn’t be insulted by a mere Intermediate.

But this was Hulao Star. Their Original Power was sealed, their strength reduced to a tenth. The youth acted on this belief.

Supreme Beings were still Supreme Beings. Though without Original Power, they weren’t a match for an Intermediate. Not even Luotian’s elders would tolerate this Intermediate.

Before Luotian spoke, one elder stepped forward to block the youth’s Original Power hand. He growled, "Come here yourself!"

The elder’s voice carried divine authority. A surge of heavenly power enveloped the youth, causing him to pale and sweat instantly. He realized Luotian was an Eight-Origin Supreme Being, far beyond his level.

"Boom..." Heavenly power cracked the youth’s body. He flew like a meteor, collapsing before Luotian and his group, unable to move.

"Which sect are you from?" Luotian smiled, asking the youth gently, as if a kind older brother.

But the youth sensed endless coldness in Luotian’s eyes. This man was a demon, ready to crush him without hesitation.

"I’m from Baitu Sect!" The youth didn’t hide, answering Luotian’s question.

At the same time, the hundred Intermediate Supreme Beings surrounding Hulao City sensed their disturbance. One by one, they appeared above Luotian’s group, eyes filled with hostility.

"Why are you here to cause trouble in Hulao Star? Are you trying to break into the prison?" A one-Origin Supreme Being spoke, clearly leading the group. He was also shocked by Luotian’s strength, even without Original Power.

"Luotian!" Luotian kicked the Intermediate Supreme Being he had previously smashed, blood splattering. He smiled at the one-Origin Supreme Being above.

"Luotian?" Hearing his name, the hundred people above showed surprise.

Luotian’s fame was known across the Four Sacred Star Domains. Even in this remote Hulao Star, it was heard of. Plus, Shang Cang Mang, Jin Yongsi, Ke Zhen Tian, and Chen Xuanning had informed their sects’ disciples that Luotian would take over Hulao Star. His portrait had reached these leaders.

The youth was shocked by Luotian’s youth but turned pale when he saw him crush the Baitu Sect’s Intermediate Supreme Being.

"You dare kill my man!" The youth hissed, his group also coldly staring at Luotian with murderous intent.

"You’re from Baitu Sect!" Luotian glanced at the youth, smiling.

To him and Zhuque Sect, Baitu Sect was an enemy. Killing a few disciples meant nothing to him.

"Killing my men demands a price!" The youth’s voice was cold, but his heart burned.

The youth was from Baitu Sect. Holding a position in Hulao Star, his talent and background were no small matter. Though Hulao Star was barren for prisoners, it was a paradise for jailers. Countless strong individuals were imprisoned here. Their resources were exploited, and even those stronger than them were oppressed.

Additionally, Hulao City wasn’t just for male prisoners. Many beautiful female disciples were imprisoned—definitely a paradise for these jailers.

With Luotian’s arrival, they might lose this paradise. This caused the youth to resent Luotian and decide to take a risk. The command from Baitu Sect’s Grandmaster had also pushed him:

"Baitu Sect, guard Hulao Star. One month later, Luotian will arrive. This person is Baitu Sect’s mortal enemy. If any disciple kills Luotian, the sect will personally take them in. Even if they can’t kill him, humiliating Luotian will earn heavy rewards!" Jin Yongsi had issued this command to Baitu Sect disciples a month ago.

The allure of being a direct disciple of Jin Yongsi was irresistible across the Four Sacred Star Domains. No young person could resist it.

"Even if you’re not identified, if you are Luotian, today you won’t escape!" The youth shouted at his group. "Brothers, let’s kill these bandits who came to break into the prison!"

Chapter 813: Various Arrivals

Outside Hulao City, a one-Origin Supreme Being with murderous intent shouted at his group. At the same time, he unleashed a dark attribute Original Power from his body and rushed toward Luotian.

Hearing the youth’s words, some of his group stood still while others roared and rushed toward Luotian’s group.

"Fifty people!" Luotian counted the ones rushing at him, his face cold.

No matter their faction, if they had hostile intent toward him, he wouldn’t let them go unchecked.

"Kill them!" Luotian muttered, addressing the thirteen elders behind him. These small fry were beneath his notice; they could handle them.

"Yes!" The thirteen elders glared with disdain. They couldn’t understand how these people were so foolish, thinking fifty could kill them—truly blinded by stupidity.

As they spoke, the thirteen elders leaped off the ground like tigers and rushed toward the fifty.

A thunderous sound echoed outside Hulao City, powerful waves colliding with its walls.

"White Tiger Transformation!" The one-Origin Supreme Being shouted. A tiger-shaped illusion burst forth, merging into his dark-attribute-wrapped body. His strength surged to the second level.

"White Tiger Transformation? Seems this kid holds a good position in Baitu Sect!" Luotian stood outside the battlefield, mentally calculating.

Without Original Power, the thirteen elders relied solely on heavenly power to fight these fifty.

Against heavenly power, Intermediate Supreme Beings could summon qi and chaos energy but were still suppressed. The battlefield quickly turned one-sided.

The only change was the youth who had transformed into a second-Origin Supreme Being. Heavenly power reduced his pressure, allowing him to fight three elders effortlessly.

"Damn kid! If you were outside, I could crush you with one hand!" The three elders glared angrily. Facing a mere second-Origin Supreme Being, they felt embarrassed—especially seeing Luotian’s gaze on them.

"Useless talk! This is Hulao City, not outside!" The youth sneered, dark Original Power exploding and surrounding the three elders.

"Get out..." The three elders roared, their feet cracking as they rushed toward the youth with incredible speed—pure body strength.

The youth was also desperate. His side was at a disadvantage; his fifty had already suffered heavy losses in one clash. Though he seemed to handle it, he knew if time passed, he’d be the meat on their chopping block.

"I can’t hold out!" The youth muttered, dodging the three elders’ attacks and fleeing to the city gate. He shouted at Hulao City: "Third Uncle, there are enemies attacking Hulao City!"

"Trying to call for help?" Luotian folded his arms, not stopping the youth’s shout.

The youth had successfully called out but was slightly distracted. He was too overconfident, believing he could dodge the three elders’ attack.

But the three elders were old veterans. Their combat experience was terrifying; they had survived countless battles to reach Six-Origin Supreme Beings.

Seizing the youth’s distraction, the three elders rushed like wind before him. Their powerful bodies delivered punches to his chest.

A crisp sound echoed in their ears. The youth’s chest caved inward, his face showing disbelief as he was directly smashed into Hulao City’s wall. Blood splattered everywhere.

The three elders didn’t miss the chance. They grabbed the youth, threw him at Luotian’s feet, awaiting his judgment.

Meanwhile, another battlefield concluded. The thirteen Six-Origin Supreme Beings had completely crushed the fifty Intermediate Supreme Beings. The ground was littered with corpses, and the elders took a deep breath before returning to Luotian.

The ground outside Hulao City now had fifty more corpses of city guards.

"So fast?" The remaining fifty looked shocked, surprised the battle ended so quickly.

"Want to kill me?" Luotian lowered his head, gently lifting the half-dead youth and smiling as he asked.

"Too big a gap. You’re just a little shrimp trying to attack my master. That’s truly overreaching!" The thirteen elders behind Luotian sneered, looking at him like a fool.

"Even Shang Cang Mang and Ke Zhen Tian couldn’t kill me. If I died by you, I wouldn’t be alive now!" Luotian spoke softly, placing his hand on the youth’s head—intending to perform a soul search.

"Who are you, daring to attack Hulao City?" Just as Luotian placed his hand on the youth’s head, a series of breaking sounds echoed from Hulao City. A cold voice rang in Luotian’s ears.

Figures appeared before Luotian and his group, causing him to smile again: "The main players have arrived."

"Kong Jinhu... What’s going on?" A middle-aged man, his face filled with authority, stood high above the sky. His gaze fell on Luotian and the thirteen blood-stained elders behind him.

"Uncle Ke, this person tried to enter Hulao City and break into the prison. We tried to stop him, but this person and his elders were too ruthless! We suffered heavy losses!" Kong Jinhu saw Ke Shui Shi, as if finding a lifeline, spoke to him.

"Kid, no matter who you are, I advise you to release Jinhu. Otherwise, more people will join the prison’s inmates!" Before Ke Shui Shi could answer, a cold voice echoed in Luotian’s ears. A white-cloaked middle-aged man stood before Ke Shui Shi.
