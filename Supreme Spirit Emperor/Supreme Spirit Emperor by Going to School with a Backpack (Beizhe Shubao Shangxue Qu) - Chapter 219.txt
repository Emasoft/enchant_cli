Chapter 968: Naivety

Within the ancient celestial palace, the bell's resounding echoes shook all present, their gazes fixed upon the graceful figure plummeting from the heavens.

Sun Feiwen let out a guttural roar, charging toward Sun Mengru. If anything befell Sun Mengru, he knew that none of them would survive returning to the Divine Clan—despite being the clan's prodigy.

Sun Feiwen also harbored deep concern; over the years, he had witnessed Sun Mengru's struggles. Though he admired her deeply, he knew their fates were irreconcilable.

Yet as Sun Feiwen neared her, a streak of light flashed past him, heedless of the immense pressure and purifying force radiating from the Epoch Bell. In an instant, it bypassed him and materialized before Sun Mengru, arms outstretched to cradle her in his embrace.

"Luotian, what do you intend?" Sun Feiwen's vision blurred; he saw Luotian, who had previously sat cross-legged beside the Epoch Bell, now holding Sun Mengru with tender affection.

The Divine Clan's assembly exchanged grim expressions. To have Sun Mengru fall into Luotian’s grasp was far worse than her falling from the sky—though they might have caught her, now she belonged to their deadliest foe.

"You still haven’t changed," Luotian smiled softly, as if deaf to the Divine Clan’s murmurs. He descended gently to the ground, cradling Sun Mengru.

Sun Mengru remained lucid; upon realizing she was in Luotian’s arms, her face paled. Never before had she been held by a man. She prepared to protest but faltered at the boundless tenderness in his eyes and the warmth of his embrace, which stirred an inexplicable fascination within her.

Even if she tried to break free, Luotian’s powerful arms held her captive. Even at her peak, breaking free would have been near impossible.

Luotian clutched Sun Mengru tightly, his gaze greedy as if the world had narrowed to them alone. After a lifetime of reincarnations, he had finally found her—how could he let her go?

All eyes were transfixed on the two figures in the sky, disbelief etched on their faces. "The Divine Clan’s goddess has been held by a man! Did I see that right?"

Luotian lowered Sun Mengru to the ground, his eyes drenched in longing as he gazed at her flawless beauty.

"Boy, release her!" The Divine Clan erupted into chaos, surrounding Luotian with feral postures. Any reckless move would see them fight him to the death.

The goddess must not be lost—this was the decree of the Divine King, etched into the hearts of the clan. For generations, only Jiang Sixi had escaped the Divine Clan; no goddess had ever left its grasp.

"Let me go!" Upon touching the ground, Sun Mengru regained clarity. A flush of shame flitted across her face—this was the first time she had been so intimately held by a man. Her expression turned cold, yet her heart pounded wildly beneath the surface, forcing her to feign composure.

Seeing Sun Mengru’s icy gaze, Luotian’s eyes darkened with sorrow. He slowly released her and imparted the incantation from the Epoch Bell’s elder to her.

Sun Mengru’s expression shifted; she sensed the incantation’s value. Her current state was dire—her dantian shattered beyond repair. Without restoration, her cultivation would vanish entirely.

"Thank you," she conveyed telepathically, yet her demeanor remained cold as she returned to the Divine Clan’s ranks under their support.

Luotian longed to seize her by force, but he knew it would backfire. Without his past memories, Sun Mengru would despise him.

"Reincarnation Pill—I must forge it!" Luotian’s eyes hardened. The materials for the Reincarnation Pill were nearly complete, save two key ingredients: the Indestructible Life Bamboo and the Celestial Mirage Demon Vine.

The Indestructible Life Bamboo had been located; once they exited the ancient celestial palace, Diao Yuanshan would lead him to claim it. As for the Celestial Mirage Demon Vine, Luotian knew it was tied to the Demon Realm.

Returning to his companions, Luotian’s gaze fell upon Chen Zhanbiao, who lay motionless, wrapped in a cocoon-like aura. His vitality was near depleted, as if on the brink of death.

"Idiot," Luotian murmured, approaching Chen Zhanbiao. The severity of his injuries was evident; Luotian could only imagine the brutal battles he had endured. To have survived was a miracle.

"Demons’ Domain!" Luotian’s eyes turned cold, his gaze fixed on Feng Jiutian and the demon forces above. A cruel smirk tugged at his lips.

Yet he did not strike. He hesitated—what consequences would arise from killing them here? If it cost him his life, it would be a futile sacrifice.

"Boom…" The heavy bell tolled again, drawing the gaze of Starfield Domain’s Zhou Wei. His eyes flickered with solemnity as he struck the Epoch Bell once more.

The resonant bell echoed, drawing all eyes back to the colossal Epoch Bell.

Sun Feiwen had already descended from the sky, leaving only the Demon Clan’s Nan Gong Feibai, Starfield Domain’s Zhou Wei, and Feng Jiutian—grim-faced as he advanced toward the Epoch Bell.

"One… two…" The bell’s echoes reverberated until Zhou Wei, in a final burst of effort, struck seven times. He did not manage the eighth, falling to the ground before Starfield Domain’s forces.

Though Zhou Wei failed to strike the ninth, his feat stunned all—his prowess as a prodigy of the age was undeniable. Though weakened, he had not fared as wretchedly as Luotian and Sun Mengru.

"I can’t endure the ninth strike," Zhou Wei smiled faintly as he returned to the ground, his voice hoarse.

Nan Gong Feibai’s expression darkened; though the purifying force had weakened him, his black demonic energy clashed against the Epoch Bell’s surface. Ultimately, it subdued him, and his condition was far from prime—seven strikes were all he could manage.

After Nan Gong Feibai, Feng Jiutian approached the Epoch Bell with a fierce glare, his teeth clenched as he stared at it.

"Only Feng Jiutian remains!" The demon forces’ faces lit with hope, yearning to witness Feng Jiutian overpower Luotian and Sun Mengru.

"Even if I die, I’ll strike the tenth!" Feng Jiutian gritted his teeth, his crimson divine power surging with overwhelming momentum toward the Epoch Bell.

"Brother, you cannot suffer in vain!" Luotian’s voice was cold, his tone icy as he vanished from sight, becoming a streak of light that shot toward Feng Jiutian above.

"Boom…" Feng Jiutian’s face twisted with madness as he relentlessly struck the Epoch Bell, his gaze resolute.

He had invested so much—even disgracing the eight great demon clans by confronting Jiuyuan Tianzun—but now he was the last to strike the Epoch Bell. The humiliation gnawed at him.

"Only by striking the tenth can I salvage some dignity!" Feng Jiutian resolved, his phoenix-shaped divine power manifesting as a golden avian form that collided with the Epoch Bell.

After five strikes, Feng Jiutian’s face darkened; as a phoenix clan member, his body was naturally formidable. Yet five strikes had already tested him beyond endurance. His true strength could have reached eight, even nine.

Now, sweat dripped from his brow, his gaze deep with resolve.

"Manifest my true form!" Feng Jiutian’s face hardened, his body radiating intense heat. Crimson divine power surged forth, and a golden phoenix cried out, revealing itself to all.

"An Xuantian Goldscale Phoenix!" Others murmured in awe, gazing at the golden phoenix.

Its feathers shimmered like armor, radiating golden light. Its tail stood high, proclaiming its bloodline’s superiority.

"An aberrant breed! A mongrel! No wonder it’s so insolent—it’s a mongrel!" Xu Liyi and others sneered, their eyes filled with contempt.

Their words ignited the demon forces’ fury; their gazes burned with madness, ready to fight.

As others overheard Xu Liyi’s taunts, they exchanged smirks, watching the demon forces. To call a phoenix clan’s rare Xuantian Goldscale Phoenix a mongrel was audacious.

Feng Jiutian manifested his true form, radiating an overwhelming confidence. He unleashed a torrent of divine power, transforming it into a golden ocean that crashed against the Epoch Bell.

"Sixth strike!" The phoenix spoke, its voice brimming with confidence. Even if the tenth could not be struck, the ninth would suffice for a fight.

"Again!" Feng Jiutian roared, his massive body emitting waves of sound as he hurled another assault at the Epoch Bell.

"Ha! How naive!" As Feng Jiutian struck the seventh, a cold voice echoed through the hall.

Light flared; a figure plummeted from the sky like a meteor, its golden foot striking Feng Jiutian’s proud head.

"Naive!" The voice echoed as Luotian appeared, his golden foot colliding with Feng Jiutian’s head.

"Boom… crack…" The bell tolled, its echoes resonating with divine incantations. Yet before the sound faded, a sharp crack of bone echoed in their ears.

"Luotian!" Their faces contorted with horror, gazing at the golden figure above—radiant as a war god.

"Ah…" A scream echoed; the golden phoenix collapsed, its body showering with blood and golden feathers.

"Did you injure my brother? Think it’s over?" Luotian’s voice brimmed with endless killing intent, his gaze fixed on Feng Jiutian.

"Feng Jiutian, what are you doing? Don’t be reckless!" Feng Jiutian’s eyes blazed with hatred, his golden body trembling.

The Epoch Bell’s terrifying tearing force continuously ravaged Feng Jiutian’s dantian, and Luotian’s kick had sent his mind reeling. The pain was near unbearable, nearly knocking him unconscious.

"Master, you said no one could disturb the bell’s striking—why didn’t you appear to destroy Luotian?" Feng Jiutian called out, his gaze fixed on the Epoch Bell.

Hearing this, all turned their eyes to him, recalling how Luotian had been warned against interference during his bell strikes.

Luotian’s eyes narrowed; he suddenly remembered the elder within the Epoch Bell—his oversight was glaring.

"Ha! Luotian, regret it now? See how you’ll manage!" Feng Jiutian, though crushed by Luotian’s kick, glowed with triumph. His golden wings flared as he ascended toward the Epoch Bell once more.

"Damn, I forgot!" Diao Dedu and others exchanged grim looks, having also forgotten the incident.

"Master, please appear and destroy this boy!" The golden phoenix’s voice carried reverence as it addressed the Epoch Bell.

"Ha! I’m in a good mood now, no desire for bloodshed. I won’t meddle in your affairs!" Yet as Feng Jiutian gloated, the elder’s voice echoed from the Epoch Bell, causing him to nearly spit blood.

"What in the world?" Their faces contorted with confusion as they gazed at the Epoch Bell, chaos erupting.

"This damned thing!" Feng Jiutian’s expression twisted as if he’d swallowed a dead toad. If he could transform into human form, his face would be priceless.

Feng Jiutian gazed at the Epoch Bell, his eyes filled with resentment. He had attacked Luotian before and been smacked dozens of feet away; now, when Luotian struck him, the elder said he was busy.

Feng Jiutian longed to curse but dared not—this elder was no ordinary figure. His cultivation was surely staggering, rivaling even the Divine Clan’s Grand Elder Sun Hewei. A true late-stage sage. He feared that if he spoke, the elder would appear and crush him with a single palm.

Luotian also gazed at the Epoch Bell, his expression peculiar—this elder clearly favored him. If he hadn’t noticed, he was truly blind.

He bowed slightly to the Epoch Bell and cast a playful glance at Feng Jiutian, clenching his fists with a satisfying crack.

"Come on, strike the Epoch Bell!" Luotian’s form darted like a golden eagle toward Feng Jiutian.

"Luotian, don’t push your luck!" Feng Jiutian’s voice carried frustration as he gazed at the golden Luotian, his eyes wild.

"I’m pushing my luck? What can you do? Rest easy—your life isn’t over yet. I’ll grant the elder this courtesy!" Luotian’s fist surged with divine power, crashing into Feng Jiutian’s massive body.

"I am a prodigy; I’ve fought early-stage sages!" Feng Jiutian cried, his body engulfed in red flames like a fiery armor.

"A mere early-stage sage—kill you like slaughtering chickens!" Luotian’s fists flashed, colliding with Feng Jiutian’s fiery armor.

"Crack!" A sharp sound echoed; golden feathers rained down as Luotian shifted his fist into a palm, piercing Feng Jiutian’s body.

Golden phoenix blood spattered, drenching Luotian’s robe. Feng Jiutian screamed, his wings unfurling to unleash a violent gust that made Luotian’s robes flutter. His massive body retreated swiftly.

At the same time, Luotian’s hand—plunged into Feng Jiutian’s body—emerged from view, tearing away large chunks of flesh laced with potent blood essence.

"Here, when Zhanbiao wakes up, roast him and taste the flavor of Xuantian Goldscale Phoenix!" Luotian tossed a golden bloodied flesh toward Diao Dedu and others, then darted after Feng Jiutian.

Hearing this, their faces contorted—especially the demon forces’ expressions turned grim. Their gazes bore hostility toward Luotian.

Though Feng Jiutian wouldn’t die, he was the crown prince of the eight demon clans’ phoenix clan. The future leader of the phoenix clan—should he be eaten, it would be a monumental embarrassment for the entire phoenix clan.

"Little brat, you seek death!" Several early-stage sage-level demon forces glared at Luotian. After some recovery, they were nearly back to full strength. Their forms darted toward Luotian.

"Come down!" Long Jie’s cold gaze met the sky, his voice radiating dragon power as he leapt into action.

"Roar!" A golden dragon materialized, its body radiating brilliance. Long Jie, unwilling to let Luotian suffer, transformed into his true form, appearing before all. His dragon power was overwhelming.

"Go back!" The massive dragon’s head spoke, its voice carrying supreme authority as it addressed the early-stage sage demon forces.

Though Long Jie was only a late-stage early-stage sage, the moment his golden dragon form manifested, the eight demon clan’s early-stage sages halted abruptly. Their eyes flashed with terror under the overwhelming bloodline pressure, collapsing to the ground.

"Dragon… Dragon Clan…" The demon forces on the ground trembled with fear. Some superiors fell to their knees, eyes filled with terror at the bloodline pressure.

"What dragon clan is this? How dense its bloodline power! I’ve seen the current elder once from afar. Why do I sense that even the Dragon Clan’s elder isn’t as pure as this one?" The beasts trembled in awe, their gazes filled with fear toward Long Jie.

"Alas…" Diao Dedu sighed, his face carrying regret as he gazed at Long Jie. In just a moment, he hadn’t kept an eye on him, allowing Long Jie to reveal his true form.

Diao Dedu knew that once they exited the ancient celestial palace, the demon forces would be in chaos. Long Jie’s identity was too shocking.

"Who are you? How could you suppress our eight great clans’ bloodlines? For so many years, this is the first time I’ve seen it!" The eight great clans’ people were utterly panicked. Though they didn’t kneel like the beasts, their strength had been severely weakened.

"Brilliant work, Long Jie! Let’s also taste the feeling of beating sages!" Xu Liyi and others, unafraid of trouble, had long held a grudge against the incident with Chen Zhanbiao.

They charged at the demon forces’ eight great clans like wolves, their light flashing as if in heat.

The onlookers grimaced at Xu Liyi and the others, silently mourning for the eight great clans. Even Diao Dedu, a member of the same clan, rushed forward with enthusiasm, seizing an early-stage sage and repeatedly striking him.

"I am who? Ha! I’m Long Jie!" Long Jie spoke solemnly, his voice echoing with thunder. He didn’t act but remained high above, knowing his companions would handle the matter. His role was to suppress these beasts.

"Damn!" Feng Jiutian’s face darkened, feeling Long Jie’s terrifying overlord pressure. Even as an Xuantian Goldscale Phoenix, he struggled to control himself, his strength further diminished.

Luotian furrowed his brow; he hadn’t wanted Long Jie to reveal his identity. If it did, it wouldn’t be good for Long Jie.

"Alas…" Luotian sighed, gazing at Feng Jiutian, directing all blame onto these eight great clans. If not for them, Chen Zhanbiao wouldn’t have been injured and remained unconscious; Long Jie wouldn’t have revealed his true form.

Thinking this, Luotian fought harder, his steps through the void like a golden lightning bolt toward Feng Jiutian.

Suddenly, the sky and earth erupted with combat sounds—though it was a one-sided碾压, the eight great clans’ beasts were treated like pigs and chickens, endlessly tormented by Luotian and others.

"Luotian’s companions are truly remarkable!" Starfield Domain’s Zhou Wei smiled, gazing at Long Jie above, sighing softly.

Chapter 969: Crushing Oppression

Within the ancient celestial palace, screams echoed through the hall as a massive beast howled in agony. Its pitiful cries sent shivers down all present.

Above, Luotian seized Feng Jiutian’s leg, tearing off large chunks of flesh. Golden feathers rained down like plucking a chicken.

"What in the world are these people?" People watched Luotian and Xu Liyi’s group, who endlessly tormented the demon forces’ eight great clans. They tore off flesh and stored it, even capturing early-stage sages.

A golden dragon coiled above the sky, its massive eyes coldly surveying all beasts beneath it. The overlord pressure suppressed every beast below, their faces filled with terror.

"That dragon’s bloodline is extremely dense. According to the Divine Clan’s records, only one beast in the demon domain could achieve this—Demonic Domain’s ruler Long Zhan Tian!" Sun Feiwen’s face was awestruck, gazing at Long Jie. He speculated Long Jie’s identity.

"Could he be the son of Domain Ruler Long Zhan Tian? It was said that Long Zhan Tian perished in the war against the Mortal Domain, leaving no descendants!" Zhou Wei’s face was puzzled as he extended his hand, stars sparkling.

"Can’t calculate!" He shook his head, gazing at Long Jie above. This was Zhou Wei’s third time unable to calculate a person—first Luotian, then Chen Zhanbiao, and now Long Jie.

"These people around him are all strange!" Zhou Wei’s gaze deepened, finally settling on Xu Liyi and Diao Dedu. His divination intent flickered but eventually softened, shaking his head.

"Never mind! Probing too much harms my cultivation!" Zhou Wei sighed softly, his gaze finally on Luotian’s group.

The screams lasted half an hour before ceasing, the demon forces’ first time suffering such treatment. All were bloodied and weak.

Large chunks of flesh lay scattered, forming a small mountain. Tian Luo and others sealed the demon forces.

Feathers and scales littered the ground, causing the prostrate beasts to tremble in fear. Their eyes were filled with terror as they gazed at Tian Luo and Xu Liyi’s group, dreading the butcher’s blade.

"Ah…" Meanwhile, the battle above concluded, Feng Jiutian completely crushed by Luotian.

Luotian, like a supreme war god, kicked Feng Jiutian to the ground, golden blood spewing from his body.

Feng Jiutian no longer resembled a majestic phoenix; he was merely a large rooster, stripped of feathers and pitiful.

"Boom…"

Luotian returned to the ground, his face cold as he cast seals, binding Feng Jiutian.

"What should we do with these people? Should we keep them as Zhanbiao’s food? I can’t afford to feed him anymore!" Xu Liyi approached Luotian, his eyes gleaming with greed.

Hearing this, people grimaced. To eat the eight great clans’ clan leaders would cause the demon domain to erupt—these people truly dared anything.

Luotian also wore a bitter smile, unsure how to handle them. If Xu Liyi’s suggestion were followed and they ate them, Luotian knew they wouldn’t escape the demon domain.

"Luotian, release us! I’ll ensure your safe exit from the demon domain. If not, the eight great clan sages are all late-stage sages. Are you sure you can escape their pursuit?" Feng Jiutian’s face twisted with hatred, struggling against the seal chains.

"Boom!" Before Feng Jiutian could speak further, Luotian’s golden foot slammed onto his beak.

"Still a prisoner—dare to threaten me!" Luotian sneered, causing Feng Jiutian’s body to tremble.

"Though we can’t kill all of them, killing one would allow Master Diao to save me. Tell me, who should I start with?" Luotian’s eyes held amusement as he surveyed the group.

"Brother, I have an idea—sacred beasts’ blood can refine the body. We could keep them nearby, feeding on their blood to enhance your physique!" Long Jie transformed into human form beside Luotian.

"Wow…" The surrounding people widened their eyes, gazing at Luotian’s group. These people were truly bold—first wanting to eat the eight great clans’ clan leaders, now planning to keep them.

Hearing Long Jie’s words, Luotian’s eyes brightened. He surveyed the group and smiled, extending his hand to lift Feng Jiutian’s massive body toward Chen Zhanbiao lying on the ground.

"Use your phoenix blood!" Luotian waved his hand, and the Cracking Spear materialized. He thrust it into Feng Jiutian’s body.

"Crash…" The immense tearing force split Feng Jiutian, who was already bloodied, creating a long wound. Golden phoenix blood spilled like money over the unconscious Chen Zhanbiao.

Chen Zhanbiao’s massive body was soon drenched in golden phoenix blood, radiating golden light.

Unconscious Chen Zhanbiao grimaced as if in pain but then, the golden phoenix blood seeped into his skin. The scarred wounds cracked with a sound.

"Not enough!" Luotian smiled, tossing Feng Jiutian aside. Feng Jiutian’s eyes flickered with weakness—being treated like an animal, he had never experienced such treatment. He even forgot his injuries and pain.

Following the same method, dragons, golden-winged eagles—each beast was bled and smeared on Chen Zhanbiao, causing the surrounding people to gasp.

"Brutal! They truly treated the eight great clans’ beasts like animals!" People’s eyes widened in disbelief, yet no one dared speak. With Luotian recovering his injuries, their strength was formidable. The only ones who could oppose them were the Divine Clan, Demon Clan, and Starfield Domain.

But these groups wouldn’t risk a rift with Luotian over the demon domain. All remained indifferent.

People knew that with Long Jie present, the demon domain was finished within the ancient celestial palace. Beasts couldn’t even fight back under Long Jie’s pressure—early-stage sages were completely suppressed.

Each beast, once strong, now lay pitifully, their blood drained and piled into a mountain.

Feng Jiutian was crushed beneath the beasts, his eyes filled with endless hatred. If looks could kill, Luotian would have died countless times in Feng Jiutian’s gaze.

Golden light spread, the sacred blood seeping into the scabs and entering Chen Zhanbiao’s skin.

"Crack…" Finally, under everyone’s anticipation, the scarred wounds began to crack, drawing all eyes to Chen Zhanbiao. Even Luotian watched him with anticipation.

Everyone knew Chen Zhanbiao’s body was strong, and after refining it with so much sacred blood, his physique would be unparalleled.

Each scab fell under their gaze, each falling releasing golden light.

Chen Zhanbiao still lay motionless, no sign of awakening. Luotian furrowed his brow—Feng Jiutian’s blood contained immense life energy. Though it wouldn’t fully restore Chen Zhanbiao, it shouldn’t leave him unconscious.

Yet as the scabs fully fell, Luotian’s brow gradually relaxed. Chen Zhanbiao now appeared more robust; his dark skin had vanished, replaced by pale skin with faint golden light. His body emitted a sound of dragon and phoenix harmonizing.

"Powerful! Even early-stage sages would be helpless against this physique!" People’s faces showed admiration, sensing the explosive power hidden in Chen Zhanbiao’s body.

Previously, Chen Zhanbiao could withstand semi-sages with his physique; now, he could fight early-stage sages with this formidable body.

"Strange—why hasn’t he awakened yet?" Tian Luo and others frowned, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao.

"I have an idea—though I’m not sure if it’ll work!" Xu Liyi smiled, addressing Tian Luo.

"What else is there to ‘work’? Try it!" Diao Dedu’s face showed impatience, gazing at Xu Liyi.

"I’ll try it—hope it’s not what I think, or it’d be too embarrassing!" Xu Liyi smiled bitterly, grabbing the mountain of beast flesh. He waved his hand, a flame erupting from it.

"Let me do it!" Seeing Xu Liyi’s actions, Luotian knew what he intended. He shook his head with a bitter smile and waved his hand, emitting the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame to envelop Xu Liyi’s flesh.

People gazed at Luotian and Xu Liyi, puzzled about their antics.

"Hiss… hiss…" Though the flesh was hard to refine, it gradually emitted white smoke under the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame’s terrifying heat.

"Boom…" As people were curious, the Epoch Bell above sounded heavily, drawing their gazes back to the sky. The elder’s aged figure slowly appeared, his eyes smiling as he surveyed Luotian and Sun Mengru.

Chapter 970: Refining the Body with Sacred Blood

Within the ancient celestial palace, screams echoed through the hall as a massive beast howled in agony. Its pitiful cries sent shivers down all present.

Above, Luotian seized Feng Jiutian’s leg, tearing off large chunks of flesh. Golden feathers rained down like plucking a chicken.

People gazed at Luotian and Xu Liyi, puzzled about their antics.

"Hisss… hisss…" Though the flesh was hard to refine, it gradually emitted white smoke under the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame’s terrifying heat.

"Boom…" As people were curious, the Epoch Bell above sounded heavily, drawing their gazes back to the sky. The elder’s aged figure slowly appeared, his eyes smiling as he surveyed Luotian and Sun Mengru.

Chapter 971: Choosing Who

As the elder appeared, people turned their gazes back to him, eyes filled with anticipation. They then focused on Luotian and Sun Mengru.

They knew both had struck the Epoch Bell twice. Unsurprisingly, the Epoch Bell would likely belong to one of them.

"You two are remarkable—your talents are unparalleled, both worthy of obtaining the Epoch Bell!" The elder spoke calmly.

"For so many years, few have struck nine times. Those who exited the ancient celestial palace became legendary sages—like that little dragon!" The elder continued, his gaze flickering over Long Jie with a smile.

"Yet it’s unfortunate that time, the little dragon didn’t take the Epoch Bell with him. This time, it shall have a master!" The elder’s gaze was deep as he spoke, concealing his thoughts.

People gazed at Luotian and Sun Mengru with reverence, their eyes filled with envy. A pseudo-Epoch Bell—who wouldn’t desire it?

"But the Epoch Bell is one. You two are both here, so assigning it poses a challenge!" The elder’s gaze was deep as he surveyed Luotian and Sun Mengru, contemplating who to grant it.

Luotian furrowed his brow; he couldn’t fathom the elder’s intentions. If forced to fight Sun Mengru, he would withdraw—how could he fight Chen Yunting?

In truth, if it were only him, Luotian would have no hesitation. But he had reached the Epoch Bell through Xu Liyi’s trust, guiding him step by step. The Epoch Bell belonged to all—fire domain and four holy star domains.

"Difficult, isn’t it? Let you two fight—winner takes it!" The elder rubbed his hands, clearly unsure of the assignment.

In truth, the elder favored Luotian slightly. Though Luotian’s talent wasn’t as superior as Sun Mengru, his character pleased the elder. Moreover, the elder sensed a terrifying power within Luotian’s body.

"Give it to him!" As people pondered, Sun Mengru opened her eyes slowly, a thunderous sound echoing from her body. Her dantian roared with a voice, radiating golden light—her entire body exuding an overwhelming aura.

"Ready to enter the sage realm!" People felt Sun Mengru’s power, their faces filled with awe. Now she seemed even stronger, her body radiating an ethereal aura that felt unattainable.

"Divine Goddess! This…!" The Divine Clan’s people, hearing Sun Mengru’s words, exchanged glances. They hadn’t expected her to yield without a fight, giving the Epoch Bell to Luotian—this was a pseudo-Epoch Bell, only three in existence for the Divine Clan.

"Are you questioning me? Do you think I’d fight him?" Sun Mengru’s face was calm, her gaze sweeping over the Divine Clan. Her voice turned icy.

"Subjects dare not!" The Divine Clan’s people bowed slightly, ceasing their words. Their eyes showed realization as they gazed at Luotian. Though they had confidence in Sun Mengru, even early-stage sages believed she could match Luotian. But they had seen Luotian’s performance—truly a prodigy among prodigies, far beyond ordinary early-stage sages.

To have Sun Mengru fight Luotian would risk her life, and they couldn’t bear that responsibility.
