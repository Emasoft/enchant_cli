“After gathering some information, Wanyoulan’s side has gone quiet. However, the senior disciple from Zhenxian Sect arrived in a rage, vowing to kill you during the trial!”

“The senior disciple from Zhenxian Sect is no ordinary man. His name is Yuan Tianjiao, and his reputation matches his name—comparable to a celestial prodigy. His combat prowess is astonishing, and his cultivation has reached mastery. He wields an Autumn Water Sword, making him invincible among peers!”

“Meanwhile, Wang Wendou’s side remains tight-lipped. However, from what I’ve learned, Wang Wendou will not give up. This man is infamous in Tianlong City for his cruelty. Once, a clan offended him; that clan was strong within Tianlong City, with its patriarch matching Wang Wendou’s strength. Yet, in the end, they were all killed—not by force, but by poison. Their cultivation was paralyzed, and that clan vanished from Tianlong City thereafter.” Long Zaitian spoke softly, his voice tinged with admiration.

“Hmph. At least we are safe for now. After all, my life depends on your rescue,” Luo Tian said softly. Three days had passed since his strength returned. Luo Tian felt the need to find an opportunity to eliminate Wang Wendou; otherwise, he would remain a thorn in his side.

“Master… this is the Mingxiangchun Tea sent by the City Lord,” a maid said as Luo Tian pondered, carrying tea utensils to their table and placing a pot of clear tea before them.

“Perfect, my throat was about to burst into flames!” Long Zaitian grabbed the tea without hesitation and poured it into a cup.

“Hmph, this tea feels strange… does it even have the aroma of tea? The City Lord must be stingy!” As Long Zaitian poured, a mist of cold vapor rose from the cup—yet it was not steam but an icy fog.

“Master, this Mingxiangchun Tea is like that. Though it appears frigid, once you drink it, it instantly warms up, and the aroma will fully blossom. It is a specialty of Tianlong City—only a few jin can be harvested annually,” the maid smiled, explaining to Luo Tian.

“Aha! I remember now—Mingxiangchun! I never thought I’d drink Mingxiangchun. This is the tea offered to Tianmen Sect elders!” Long Zaitian suddenly recalled after the maid’s explanation.

Without hesitation, he gulped it down, while Luo Tian and Long Youlan took a sip with curiosity.

“*Wum…*” A cold sensation immediately spread through Luo Tian’s mouth, but the next moment, his expression shifted. His eyes darkened as he felt no aroma or warmth—only the cold intensified, transforming into a frigid chill that slithered down his throat and into his body.

In contrast, Long Zaitian and Long Youlan were instantly frozen in place, sitting rigidly.

“*Yi…*” The maid stared at their condition, stunned and confused.

At that moment, three figures in black robes appeared outside Luo Tian’s courtyard. Three shadows flashed like lightning, rushing toward the three of them.

“Die!” A low, cold voice echoed through the courtyard as the three figures materialized before Luo Tian.

“*Hao…*” A deep growl echoed beside Luo Tian, and he lunged toward the Tianxian-ranked black-cloaked figure.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian, seemingly battling the ice, spat out two streaks of seven-colored flames, instantly enveloping Long Zaitian and Long Youlan.

“*Who dies?*” Luo Tian punched forward, striking the Tiandao-ranked black-cloaked figure.

“*You die!*” The black-cloaked figure’s eyes narrowed in disbelief, surprised Luo Tian could still move. In an instant, he was struck directly.

“*Crack…*” Before the black dagger could pierce Luo Tian, a crackling sound echoed from the figure’s chest. He was sent flying backward, blood soaking his black robes.

“*Uncle Wang!*” A young voice cried out as another figure saw his companion flying backward and rushed toward him.

“*Ugh…*” Long Youlan and Long Zaitian regained their senses, relief in their eyes. The cold had nearly frozen their souls.

“You truly are relentless!” Luo Tian stepped forward toward the two black-cloaked figures.

Meanwhile, Xiaoyue Tianlang clashed with the Tianxian-ranked black-cloaked figure. Its icy fangs continuously tore at the opponent, who bore numerous wounds.

“What’s happening?” Zuo Qiuming’s face darkened as he flew into Luo Tian’s courtyard, realizing the situation immediately. His expression turned grim as he approached the black-cloaked figure battling Xiaoyue Tianlang.

Luo Tian was attacked! Zuo Qiuming’s face darkened; Luo Tian’s life was tied to his. If Luo Tian perished, he would also suffer consequences. Moreover, the attack within the City Lord’s residence made him feel embarrassed.

Unluckily, Xiaoyue Tianlang bit off the black-cloaked figure’s mask, revealing an aged face—Wang Wendou, the head steward of Tianlong City.

“*Wang Wendou!*” Zuo Qiuming’s face darkened, his gaze fixed on the aged figure with fury.

“*Master!*” Wang Wendou’s face paled as Zuo Qiuming appeared. Luo Tian, with a cold expression, had Xiaoyue Tianlang return to his side.

“*You ignored my words?*” Zuo Qiuming spoke solemnly, making Wang Wendou’s face pale.

“*Lord Zuo, you’re mistaken. I only wanted to teach him a lesson!*” Wang Wendou’s gaze met Zuo Qiuming’s darkened eyes, protesting loudly.

“*I’ve endured your betrayal for over twenty years, and I’m reluctant to kill you!*” Zuo Qiuming sighed softly, his gaze deep.

“But you’ve repeatedly challenged my limits. I’ve tolerated you for years!” Zuo Qiuming spoke softly, raising his hand.

“*Master, do you forget our bond of life and death? Do you forget how I shielded you from the墨霜蜈蚣?*” Wang Wendou, seeing Zuo Qiuming’s hand raised, felt genuine intent to kill. He shouted desperately.

Hearing Wang Wendou’s words, Zuo Qiuming’s expression darkened. If not for Wang Wendou shielding him from the墨霜蜈蚣, he might have been killed.

“*Rip…*” Wang Wendou saw Zuo Qiuming pause and tore open his robe, revealing a thin body with several black marks on his chest—wounds from shielding Zuo Qiuming against the墨霜蜈蚣.

“*Enough… enough…*” Zuo Qiuming sighed deeply, gazing at Luo Tian with regret.

“*Lord Zuo, you have a heart of mercy, but it has been exploited for years!*” Luo Tian, seeing Zuo Qiuming’s wavering resolve, spoke softly.

“What do you mean?” Zuo Qiuming’s expression shifted slightly; he knew Luo Tian spoke with hidden meaning.

“Though I don’t know why you went to the forbidden land, it must have something to do with this loyal steward of yours!” Luo Tian spoke softly.

“Correct, he was the one who brought the news that a divine herb existed in Tianlong Mountains. That’s why I led people there!” Zuo Qiuming replied softly, gazing at Wang Wendou.

“From what I know, the poison of墨霜蜈蚣 is strong but not enough to leave a nearly Tianxian late-stage immortal in such a state. Moreover, I checked yesterday and found your condition involves another cold poison that complements the墨霜蜈蚣’s toxin, causing this state!” Luo Tian spoke, pouring some remaining tea into Zuo Qiuming’s cup.

“And the poison in your body is identical to the one I drank earlier!” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Zuo Qiuming. He believed Zuo Qiuming’s intelligence would grasp the implication.

Zuo Qiuming’s face darkened as he held the tea cup, gazing at Wang Wendou. He recalled that all his meals had been prepared by Wang Wendou for years.

At the same time, Luo Tian approached the other two black-cloaked figures, lifting them and removing their masks before throwing them at Wang Wendou’s feet. They were Wang Wendou’s son and a middle-aged man.

“*Is he truly his?*” Zuo Qiuming’s hand trembled as he held the tea cup, gazing at Wang Wendou.

“*I have nothing to offer, but beg you for my son’s life on the years I’ve served you!*” Wang Wendou spoke softly, his voice unusually calm.

Chapter 1796: Old Wang ()

“*Do you think I’d let your son live?*” Zuo Qiuming sighed deeply, gazing at Wang Quandan and the middle-aged man.

As Tianlong City Lord, Zuo Qiuming was decisive in his actions. Having decided to kill Wang Wendou, he understood the necessity of eliminating all threats.

“*City Lord, City Lord! We’re not involved with him! Don’t harm me! He’s not the steward’s son!*” Seeing Zuo Qiuming’s gaze, the middle-aged man spat blood and desperately bowed before him.

“*Old Wang… what do you mean?*” Wang Wendou’s gaze held shock as he looked at the middle-aged man, his trusted confidant.

“*City Lord, I’m certain he’s not the steward’s son!*” The middle-aged man’s face was pale, but his voice was resolute.

“*He looks a bit like old Wang!*” Long Zaitian gazed at the middle-aged man, and even Wang Quandan wore an expression of disbelief.

“*Steward, now that the truth is out, I have nothing to hide. Please spare our lives! I didn’t mean to… it was your concubine who seduced me. Thus, Quandan is my son!*” The middle-aged man gazed at Wang Wendou.

“*What!?”* Everyone’s faces showed disbelief as they stared at the white-haired Wang Wendou, who seemed to have a halo of green.

“*Puke…*” Wang Wendou’s eyes burned with fury, spitting blood as his chest heaved. He gazed at the middle-aged man.

“*City Lord, we have no connection with Wang Wendou! Please grant us a path to survival!*” The middle-aged man, like a desperate fool, gazed at Zuo Qiuming.

“*Haha…*” Long Zaitian couldn’t help laughing, gazing at Wang Wendou.

“*Karma! Old Wang’s name is fitting this time—betraying his master, and now betrayed in return, wearing a green hat!*” Long Zaitian glared at Wang Wendou.

“*Die for me!*” Wang Wendou leaped forward, striking the middle-aged man with a palm. His eyes were ablaze as he struck the man’s head.

“*Alas…*” Zuo Qiuming sighed deeply without stopping Wang Wendou.

“*Crack…*” The middle-aged man hadn’t reacted before his head was struck, the sound of a crisp crack echoing. His head shattered like a watermelon before everyone’s eyes.

“*Fool!*” Wang Wendou’s eyes were crimson as he gazed at Wang Quandan, his teeth clenched. If not for this fool, he wouldn’t have reached this state. And now, this fool wasn’t even his son.

Wang Wendou thought of the years Wang Quandan had caused him trouble, his body ignited with fury.

“*Father… father…*” Wang Quandan trembled in fear, collapsing to the ground. The words of “old Wang” left him stunned and unable to accept.

Wang Quandan hadn’t expected the “uncle” who had always been kind to him—his “uncle”—to be his real father. Meanwhile, the man he had called father for twenty years, who was strict but always covered his misdeeds, had no relation to him.

“*Die!*” Wang Wendou approached Wang Quandan and struck with a palm, killing him instantly.

“*Plop…*” Wang Quandan’s body fell to the ground with a thud, blood gushing from his orifices, eyes filled with terror and confusion.

“*Haha…*” Wang Wendou laughed maniacally after killing Wang Quandan, gazing at the blood in his hands.

“*I planned for so many years, yet it was your son who ruined me!*” Wang Wendou gazed at Luo Tian with resentment.

“*I’m not content! My decades of effort were all for nothing!*” Wang Wendou roared, but after a fit of wild yelling, he fell to the ground.

“*Actually, you should thank me. Without me, you wouldn’t have discovered that for twenty years, you’ve raised another’s son!*” Luo Tian smiled.

“*Haha, karma!*” Wang Wendou sighed deeply, sitting on the ground in despair.

“*But all of this is because of you, Zuo Qiuming. Why did you leave the Tianmen Sect to come here and become City Lord?*

“If not for your sudden arrival in Tianlong City, the City Lord position would have been mine. I’ve waited ten years for the previous City Lord to vanish silently. Yet it still wasn’t mine!” Wang Wendou’s face showed another grimace, his eyes filled with resentment.

“*Do you think the墨霜蜈蚣 appeared without reason? I knew about it long ago. Thus, I carried a Mist Dragon Incense to lure the beast to you. I never expected your luck was so strong that even the centipede’s core couldn’t kill you!*

“I had no choice but to poison you. Originally, I planned to wait two more years for your death. But Luo Tian appeared and ruined my plan!” Wang Wendou spoke calmly, knowing Zuo Qiuming wouldn’t let him live.

“*Blame me?*” Zuo Qiuming’s face bore coldness, surprised Wang Wendou had schemed against him for so long.

“*It was your own fault. If you hadn’t spoiled your son, this wouldn’t have happened. Perhaps your plan would’ve succeeded!*” Luo Tian shook his head gently.

“*Enough. On the years you served me, end your life!*” Zuo Qiuming looked exhausted; he had trusted this steward for years, yet he schemed against him.

“*Thank you… I hesitated for many years but gave it up. However, I warn you: beware of your enemies. This is my advice!*” Wang Wendou spoke again, then struck his head with a palm.

“*Peng…*” A dull sound echoed, and Wang Wendou’s body fell to the ground. Zuo Qiuming’s face slightly changed.

“*Enemies!*” Zuo Qiuming’s face shifted slightly, his gaze cold.

“*Luo brother, this is what you needed! I’ve prepared it these days!”” Zuo Qiuming then spoke to Luo Tian, his voice returning to excitement.

“*Three days later, I’ll treat you, City Lord!*” Luo Tian’s eyes brightened as he took Zuo Qiuming’s storage ring.

“*Time to get busy!*” Luo Tian spoke softly, then walked into his room.

Zuo Qiuming also had the bodies of the three men removed and left Luo Tian’s courtyard.

……

The next few days, Luo Tian entered a cultivation mode, sending the maids away and leaving only Long Zaitian and Long Youlan.

“*Boom…*” Thunderous sounds echoed in Luo Tian’s courtyard, leaving the City Lord’s people astonished.

“*Unexpectedly, Luo Tian is also a cultivator!*” The City Lord’s people marveled, gazing at the descending lightning.

“He is even a second-grade cultivator!” Zuo Qiuming stood in his courtyard, speaking softly. His wife Xue Yushan stood beside him, her gaze filled with anticipation.

“This boy is good; I’ve heard the maids speak of Luo Tian. He’s approachable!” Xue Yushan smiled softly.

“*You, bring him in—could he be a hidden asset for us?*” Zuo Qiuming’s eyes narrowed, thinking.

“Such a talent—equivalent to an immortal, with unparalleled combat power and a divine cultivator. His future is limitless. We can try, but I noticed from his handwriting that he’s defiant and proud!” Xue Yushan spoke softly.

“*I felt it too. He handles affairs with precision, decisive in killing and eliminating threats. I like his character. However, he values loyalty and is grateful!*” Zuo Qiuming spoke softly, making his decision.

“*But all of this is conditional on curing your cold poison. I want a child of our own!*” Xue Yushan spoke softly, her eyes filled with hope.

“*Yes, our own child!*” Zuo Qiuming’s face also showed excitement. The cold poison had not only damaged his cultivation but also prevented him from having children, making him feel guilty toward Xue Yushan.

Time passed slowly as Luo Tian appeared at Zuo Qiuming’s courtyard, smiling.

“*Luo brother, you’ve come!*” Zuo Qiuming and his wife smiled excitedly, stepping out of the courtyard to greet Luo Tian. Zuo Qiuming’s voice trembled slightly.

“*City Lord, you’ve waited long!*” Luo Tian spoke softly, guided into a grand hall by Zuo Qiuming. Xue Yushan stood outside the hall, her body radiating waves of power.

“*Strong!*” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed slightly, surprised by Xue Yushan’s strength. He could sense her aura was stronger than Zuo Qiuming’s, even rivaling Zhao Tiancheng, a senior elder of the Dihmen Sect.

“*Can we start?*” Zuo Qiuming impatiently asked, bringing Luo Tian back to reality.

“*Yes, but the treatment will be painful. Afterward, you’ll need to release your energy…*” Luo Tian smiled knowingly, gazing at the hall’s entrance.

“*Yes!*” Zuo Qiuming nodded, his heart burning with excitement. He never expected Luo Tian to notice this.

Chapter 1798: Brotherhood ()

“*City Lord, whatever you need, I’ll do my best!*” Luo Tian smiled.

“*Not really a matter. I felt a connection with you and wish to become brothers. Do you agree?*” Zuo Qiuming spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian with hope.

Hearing this, Luo Tian, Long Youlan, and Long Zaitian all showed disbelief, gazing at Zuo Qiuming.

“*I’m willing!*” Long Zaitian’s heart shouted; if he could become a brother to Zuo Qiuming, no one in Tianlong City would dare disrespect him. Just thinking made Long Zaitian feel exhilarated.

“*City Lord, don’t joke! I’m just a country bumpkin; how could I be worthy of your company?*” Luo Tian smiled, recalling Wang Wendou’s words about Zuo Qiuming being his enemy. If he truly became a brother to Zuo Qiuming, he’d be bound to his ship.

“*Luo brother, what are you saying? People have no rank—your refusal means you look down on me!*” Zuo Qiuming’s face showed displeasure.

Originally, Zuo Qiuming planned to adopt Luo Tian as a son but reconsidered and decided to become brothers instead. He never expected this boy to refuse.

“*How could such a good opportunity fall on me?*” Long Zaitian mentally lamented, wishing he were Luo Tian.

“*Alright… alright…*” Seeing Zuo Qiuming’s displeasure, Luo Tian sighed deeply. Though he didn’t know what dangers awaited him on Zuo Qiuming’s ship, he knew he’d gain benefits.

“*Since my elder brother values me so much, I’ll accept without refusal!*” Luo Tian smiled and clasped his hands, bowing to Zuo Qiuming: “Elder Brother, please accept my greeting!”

“*Haha, dear brother, rise!*” Zuo Qiuming laughed and helped Luo Tian up. He waved his hand, summoning an incense burner before the four of them.

“*This is really formal!*” Luo Tian sighed in his heart, then knelt beside Zuo Qiuming to perform the brotherhood ceremony.

“*Wum…*” Waves rose from the heavens, enveloping Luo Tian and Zuo Qiuming.

“*Not seeking to be born on the same day, but to die together!*” Luo Tian and Zuo Qiuming spoke in unison. As their voices faded, a strange mark dispersed, entering both of their bodies.

“*Elder Brother…*” At the moment the mark was imprinted, Luo Tian felt a closer bond with Zuo Qiuming. Zuo Qiuming also looked at Luo Tian more favorably.

“*Brother, from now on, we are family!*” Zuo Qiuming smiled, gazing at Luo Tian.

“*Elder Brother, I do have a request… my two friends’ matters. My sister wishes to enter the Tianmen Sect; do you think, with your experience, she has a chance?*” Luo Tian smiled and asked Zuo Qiuming. Having an elder brother, a late-stage Celestial Immortal with status in the Tianmen Sect, was too useful to ignore.

“*Brother, don’t mock me. This girl’s talent is average, but consider the number of prodigies from the lower three realms who have arrived. In the past, she had a two or three percent chance of success. But now I can tell you there’s no possibility at all!*” Zuo Qiuming shook his head gently.

“*Alas…*” Hearing this, Long Youlan sighed in disappointment. Since entering Tianlong City, he felt his inadequacy. In the five cities, he was a strong figure, but in Tianlong City, he felt like an ordinary person with countless Celestials.

“*However, your sister is my sister. Entering the Tianmen Sect—rest assured, I have some influence. I can’t guarantee her entry into the inner sect, but I can ensure she enters the outer one!*” Zuo Qiuming smiled.

“*And your friend—stay by my side! I’ve reached the late-stage Celestial Immortal and must return to the Tianmen Sect. With Wang Wendou dead, he’ll temporarily serve as the City Lord’s steward. If his cultivation advances quickly, the City Lord position will be his!*” Zuo Qiuming gazed at Long Zaitian, offering another gift.

“*This…*” Hearing this, Long Zaitian’s eyes immediately showed excitement. The City Lord position—something he never even dreamed of—now had hope.

“*Thank you, elder brother!*” Luo Tian smiled, having resolved Long Youlan and Long Zaitian’s matters.

“*Brother, what are your plans next?*” However, Zuo Qiuming’s face turned serious.

“*Hmph, I’ll try… I have some matters to find people for, so I must enter one of the three major sects!*” Luo Tian spoke softly, giving Long Zaitian and Long Youlan a glance. He felt that what was to come might be important for him, and the words he heard could be unfavorable for them.

Long Youlan and Long Zaitian understood Luo Tian’s meaning and left Luo Tian’s courtyard.

“*Brother, I have a request too!*” Zuo Qiuming spoke after Long Youlan and Long Zaitian left.

“*Elder Brother, please!*” Luo Tian smiled, knowing the serious matter had arrived.

“*I wish for you to directly participate in the inner sect’s trial and attempt to become a direct disciple of Tianmen Sect’s Grand Master Xuan Dan!*” Zuo Qiuming spoke to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian said nothing, gazing at Zuo Qiuming in wait for his next words.

“*I was once a prodigy of the Tianmen Sect, even ranking first among them!*” Zuo Qiuming’s face showed pride, recalling his youth.

“My master was also one of the eight elders of the Tianmen Sect. Every candidate for sect leader is chosen from among the disciples or offspring of these eight elders!”

“*However, my master disappeared during an expedition and never returned!*” Zuo Qiuming shook his head gently.

“*Without my master’s support, I became more low-key, but the other elders feared me. Thus, five of them demanded my exclusion from the sect leader’s race, while only my wife’s father defended me. However, the sect leader had his own disciples, so I was directly excluded!*”

“*Though I was excluded, my status as a direct disciple remained. My wife’s father is also one of the eight elders; she still has a chance to vie for the sect leader position!*”

“*At that time, I was too proud and rejected the outer elder’s status. I chose to enter Tianlong City instead, knowing that if I became an outer elder, I might remain one for life. But the City Lord position was different—I could manage Tianlong City and it wasn’t much worse than an outer elder. With years of effort, I’ve won over two elders to my side!*”

“*Among the eight elders, the most important is Grand Master Xuan Dan of the Dyeing Sect. Though he has many disciples, none are true apprentices. I wish for you to become his disciple and persuade him to let me reclaim the sect leader’s qualification!*” Zuo Qiuming gazed at Luo Tian.

“*Hmph…*” Luo Tian nodded slightly, his eyes deep in thought as he tapped the table. He knew Zuo Qiuming’s plan was simple, but executing it would be difficult. The remaining elders wouldn’t let him return easily.

Though Zuo Qiuming had been poisoned for years, his cultivation surged back to its original level. These people wouldn’t sit idly by.

“*If you refuse, it’s fine; I’ll find another way!*” Zuo Qiuming’s eyes showed determination and confidence.

“*I, Zuo Qiuming, was once the top prodigy; I can return and fight back!*” Zuo Qiuming spoke softly.

“I’ll try my best!”

“But, elder brother, you must promise me one thing: if you become the Tianlong Sect leader, help me with a matter!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his eyes smiling.

“*Of course!*” Zuo Qiuming smiled and nodded.

“*Haha, let’s go! No wine, no fun!*” They discussed further and then Zuo Qiuming pulled Luo Tian to drink.

Time passed slowly, and Luo Tian stayed in the City Lord’s residence, waiting for the Tianmen Sect trial.

As time passed, news of Luo Tian and City Lord Zuo Qiuming’s brotherhood spread throughout Tianlong City, leaving people astonished.

“*What is this Luo Tian’s background? How could he become a brother to the City Lord!*” People gossiped, speculating about his worth.

While Luo Tian waited for the trial, other sect prodigies also arrived in Tianlong City.

These prodigies were not comparable to those from ordinary cities; they arrived first and visited the City Lord, Zuo Qiuming.

Faced with so many prodigies, Zuo Qiuming couldn’t afford to be careless. Though one or two were manageable, too many posed a terrifying force.

“*City Lord, I heard there’s a prodigy named Luo Tian in your residence. You’ve even become his brother and given him the only inner sect disciple slot!*” A group of prodigies sat in a grand hall prepared by Zuo Qiuming, questioning him.

“*Yes, if you wish to see him, you’ll have the chance during the trial!*” Zuo Qiuming smiled and replied.

“*City Lord, I don’t know what kind of charm this Luo Tian has, but I hope you’ll let me have the inner sect slot instead. My sect, Tianxing Sect, feels it’s unfair!”* A young man in a blue robe smiled and spoke to Zuo Qiuming.

“*Zhang Xing, I don’t think you have the qualifications!*” Before Zhang Xing’s words ended, a handsome young man in refined attire spoke up.

“*Qian Luofeng, what do you mean?*” Zhang Xing’s face turned angry.

“*I have the qualifications… you all don’t have what it takes to compete with me!*” As Luofeng and Zhang Xing spoke, the atmosphere became chaotic. These proud sect disciples began arguing, forgetting about Luo Tian and Zuo Qiuming’s decision to give the slot to him.

“*An idol, that’s Tianxing Sect’s Zhang Xing; that’s Luofeng Sect’s Qian Luofeng…*” In the corner, Luo Tian and Long Zaitian stood. Long Zaitian continuously pointed at each prodigy, introducing them to Luo Tian.

“*Luofeng Sect and Tianxing Sect are both strong, like the Luan Tian Sect!*” Long Zaitian spoke continuously, recounting these prodigies’ achievements to Luo Tian. This was what Long Zaitian had gathered over the days.

“*Interesting!*” Luo Tian smiled, watching these quarreling prodigies. He instinctively felt they were much stronger than Yao Qishui’s kind.

“*Everyone!*” Seeing the prodigies in chaos, Zuo Qiuming’s face darkened. His late-stage Celestial Immortal cultivation was formidable, and his aura silenced the prodigies instantly.

“*Luo Tian’s qualification has been given; I won’t retract it. If you wish to cause trouble, go ahead, but don’t break my rules. You know the consequences!*” Zuo Qiuming’s face bore authority, having intended to give these prodigies a courtesy but they had overstepped.

“*City Lord, we just want to see Luo Tian; no other ill intent!*” Zhang Xing spoke and bowed.

“*You want to see Luo Tian, but he doesn’t wish to meet you!*” A soft laugh echoed as Yuan Tianjiao and her disciples entered from outside, gazing at the prodigies.

“*Zhenxian Sect?*” Recognizing Yuan Tianjiao’s robe, people immediately identified her. Though Zhenxian Sect was a sect, Yuan Tianjiao’s fame was immense; many had heard of her name in the lower three realms.

“*Indeed, this is the one you seek—Luo Tian!*” Yuan Tianjiao smiled and pointed at Luo Tian in the corner.

“*Hush…*” The crowd turned their gaze to Luo Tian, eyes filled with disdain.

“*Is that him?*” They saw Luo Tian and felt he was unremarkable, thus looking down on him. After all, they considered him a country bumpkin, not matching their elite sect disciples.

The rumors about Luo Tian from days ago hadn’t been witnessed, so they doubted their validity.

“*A chatty fool!*” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed coldly, gazing at Yuan Tianjiao in white robes. Their gazes met.

“*A coward hiding in the corner, a rat!*” Zhang Xing spoke softly and approached Luo Tian.

“*Who let you in?*” Zuo Qiuming’s face darkened, addressing the guards beside him.

“*Lord City, you said today to welcome all sect prodigies, regardless of their sect!*” The guard lowered his head, looking委屈.

“*Ah, well… I misunderstood!*” Zuo Qiuming realized the guard’s intention. If he had blocked Yuan Tianjiao, others would have criticized him.

Luo Tian, realizing his identity was exposed, smiled and walked toward Zuo Qiuming, gazing at the prodigies.

“*You are Luo Tian?*” Zhang Xing gazed at Luo Tian, not even looking directly. He deemed it unworthy to acknowledge him for his hesitation.

Others also gazed at Luo Tian with disdain, giving him an initial impression of cowardice.

“*Alas…*” Luo Tian sighed deeply, understanding what these prodigies thought. He had encountered many prodigies in his life; they were arrogant, sharp, and looked down on everyone with a sense of superiority.
