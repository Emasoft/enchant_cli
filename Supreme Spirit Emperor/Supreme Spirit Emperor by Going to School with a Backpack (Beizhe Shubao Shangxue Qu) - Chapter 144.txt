The Qionghua Sect of the Southern Region was now plunged into chaos, for just moments ago, the soul-lanterns of Master Shen Qionghua and over a dozen disciples who had been taken by the Grand Elder had all shattered at once, turning to dust and scattering upon the altar. This left the entire Qionghua Sect in a state of boundless terror.

A major sect suffering such losses could not help but incite panic.

"Southern Region's Qionghua Sect! To destroy my Northern Region's Five Elements Sect, this grudge must be avenged. I grant you seven days to prepare! Seven days later, my Five Elements Sect's many masters shall come to Qionghua Sect and avenge today's disgrace!" A cold voice echoed through the skies of Qionghua Sect, plunging it into complete panic.

"Five Elements Sect is so weak? How could they have such a powerful master? His voice alone travels this far—this must be a World Lord!"

"Quickly contact all the sects allied with Qionghua Sect and beg for their help, or else after seven days, our sect shall vanish into oblivion!" The remaining dozen Grand Elders of Qionghua Sect, their faces marked with anxiety, continuously summoned jade tablets and communicated with various sects through mental transmission.

Above the Five Elements Sect, the Grand Master, the Demon Lord, gazed with sorrow at the ruined Five Elements Mountain, his withered fingers moving swiftly, emitting wisps of gray qi that encircled the mountain.

"Boom... Boom..." In awe, the disciples watched as buildings once shattered rose anew, and nearly thirty thousand corpses gradually restored to their original forms—though only as flesh.

"By my Demon Lord's name, I invoke Reincarnation! Let these three drops of essence blood be the catalyst. Return, my children!" The aged voice of the Demon Lord resonated in their hearts.

As his words ended, the sky darkened. A vast Reincarnation Passage appeared before them.

Three drops of crimson blood flew from the Demon Lord's fingers into the passage. After this, his already aged face bore a pale hue.

"Buzz..." The Reincarnation Passage emitted a deep hum after the three drops of blood entered it.

"One... one hundred... one thousand..." Gray souls, as if drawn by an unseen force, emerged from the passage. Familiar faces appeared before the Five Elements Sect disciples.

"That's Senior Brother Wang... that's Junior Brother Li..." The disciples cried out, eyes alight with excitement as gray souls emerged from the passage.

Nearly twenty thousand souls poured forth like a rain of gray spirits, streaking downward toward the fallen corpses on Five Elements Mountain.

Each soul that descended caused a disciple to rise slowly, their faces bewildered before recognizing the familiar surroundings and expressions of joy.

"I'm alive... hahaha... I'm alive!" Laughter echoed throughout Five Elements Sect.

"Ugh..." A gray soul, under Zhang Ziping's expectant gaze, rushed into Wei Mingxuan's body.

"What's happening?" Wei Mingxuan looked puzzled at Zhang Ziping, who stood before him with unrestrained joy.

"Father! You've returned! The Grand Master has arrived and saved Five Elements Sect, saving you!" Zhang Ziping was overjoyed, whispering softly.

"What did you call me? Hahaha! You finally recognized me!" Wei Mingxuan laughed heartily, his voice filled with emotion. Tears streamed down his face as he embraced Zhang Ziping tightly, unable to speak further. The decades-old rift between Wei Mingxuan and Zhang Ziping was finally resolved, leaving him overwhelmed with emotion.

Luo Tian, Lei Yong, and Ji Chen watched this scene, their eyes glistening. None of them had known that Wei Mingxuan and Zhang Ziping were father and son. They felt immense joy for Zhang Ziping, recalling how he had cared for them all these years.

After an hour, nearly twenty-five thousand disciples of Five Elements Sect stood again. Yet, several tens of thousands had perished forever.

"Revenge!" The disciples' faces bore cold expressions as they shouted in unison, their collective icy killing intent rising into the sky.

"Enough. Everyone go rest. As for revenge, leave it to us. You must focus on cultivation; now our Five Elements Sect has ample elixirs, so improve your strength swiftly!" Wei Mingxuan stood in the sky, addressing his disciples. His Grand Master aura was unmistakable.

After speaking, Wei Mingxuan began issuing orders one by one, organizing the restoration of Five Elements Sect.

Luo Tian and the Grand Master, along with several other Grand Elders in the Concentration Soul Realm, vanished from sight of Five Elements Sect disciples and appeared within the Grand Hall of the main peak.

The Grand Master, his face marked with satisfaction, gazed at those seated below him. "I never expected that during my absence, Five Elements Sect would have developed so far. Thank you all for your hard work!"

After the Grand Master spoke, his gaze turned to Luo Tian. "This time I managed to escape thanks to you, lad. Speak your conditions—anything I can do, I won't refuse. But please, don’t ask me to resurrect over twenty thousand people again; that kind of expenditure is beyond my capacity!"

Hearing the Grand Master's words, everyone bore expressions of shock. Resurrecting twenty thousand people was akin to a divine technique. Even the Grand Master, a World Lord, had paid the price of three drops of essence blood—this was truly terrifying.

After attaining Concentration Soul, one's body contained only ten drops of essence blood. Each drop nurtured a soul and an essence, totaling ten. Losing one meant losing either a soul or an essence. This kind of expenditure was truly beyond ordinary comprehension.

"Respectfully, I have no other requests. Just help me find a soul. If convenient, assist in retrieving it!" Luo Tian's face softened as he pressed his hand against the Soul-Keeping Jade, revealing Chen Yunting's gray soul, bewildered and appearing before them.

"Half a soul?" The Grand Master's eyes flickered slightly as he observed Chen Yunting's soul, his expression puzzled.

Gu Qianxue and Luo Tian's group bore expectant looks toward the Grand Master, awaiting his response.

"This is relatively simple. Let me check where this little one's other half soul lies!" The Grand Master spoke, his withered hand moving slightly as he closed his eyes.

"Buzz..." An invisible wave appeared between the Grand Master and Chen Yunting's half soul, as if something had connected them.

Time passed slowly. Under the tense and expectant gazes of Luo Tian's group, the Grand Master finally opened his eyes. A flash of golden light passed through them. The Grand Master's face bore a hint of killing intent as he murmured three words: "Wangyue Sect!"

"Wangyue Sect!" Luo Tian's expression flickered slightly upon hearing the name. He soon understood—Wangyue Sect was the predecessor of the Tianshi Sect.

"Correct. This little one's other half soul has been taken by Wangyue Sect. It should now be in the Western Region, within Wangyue Sect's main base!" The Grand Master spoke, raising his hand. A vision appeared within the hall.

The image showed a sinister grand hall. A gray soul was bound by an invisible barrier. Each time the soul attempted to step beyond, it released waves of green smoke.

Beside the soul stood a young face—Yang Huanyu, familiar to Luo Tian. His face bore an icy smile as if sensing something. He turned his head, gazing into the void and murmured a few words.

"This is what you've been seeking. If you desire it, come and take it yourself!" Though the sound was inaudible, Luo Tian understood what Yang Huanyu had said by reading his lips.

Chapter 706: March to Qionghua Sect

"Crack..." Luo Tian's face darkened completely. His hands clenched tightly, his gaze fixed on Yang Huanyu in the image, who was triumphant. His killing intent surged uncontrollably, his entire body trembling.

Gu Qianxue approached, gently taking Luo Tian's hand with a soft voice. "Don't rush. Now that we have clues, it's good news!"

"Right! Luo Tian, having clues is good. Once our strength improves a bit more, we'll accompany you to destroy the Western Region!" Xu Liyi and others spoke in turn, their eyes filled with concern.

"Breath... " Luo Tian exhaled deeply, returning to his usual demeanor. He bowed respectfully to the Grand Master and others before leaving the hall.

Xu Liyi and others also departed, following Luo Tian. They hadn't thought much—knowing that the Grand Master and Wei Mingxuan would surely discuss things thoroughly, they only needed to carry out orders.

"Boom... Boom..." As Luo Tian returned to his small courtyard, the skies above Five Elements Sect again echoed with thunder.

For three days, purple lightning continuously struck his courtyard. The entire Five Elements Sect's disciples were stunned. They knew Luo Tian was likely crafting nine-star elixirs during these days.

Indeed, in those three days, Luo Tian had tirelessly crafted nearly ten nine-star elixirs. He distributed them to Tian Luo and Xu Liyi, enhancing their strength.

Luo Tian had only crafted for three days. After that, the thunderous sounds of elixirs vanished from sight.

"Three nine-star elixirs—enough to elevate me to the Concentration Soul Peak!" Luo Tian's face bore a hint of anticipation. He sat cross-legged in his courtyard, holding three powerful elixirs. If not for his control, the three elixirs might have flown from his hands.

Without hesitation, Luo Tian placed one elixir into his mouth and closed his eyes, sitting cross-legged on the ground.

At the same time, Lei Yong, Ji Chen, and Tian Luo also sat cross-legged in their respective quarters, entering a state of meditation.

The disciples of Five Elements Sect experienced another wave of cultivation frenzy. Each day, many progressed in rank. After the incident with Qionghua Sect, they were more united and worked harder, steadily enhancing their strength.

Meanwhile, Qionghua Sect was bleak. Dozens of Grand Elders sat in a grand hall, their faces grim.

"Damn it! All bastards!" One Grand Elder's face bore anger. He smashed the stone table before him into pieces.

These past days, these dozens had continuously contacted sects allied with Qionghua Sect to seek help. But all were rejected. Only a few second-rate sects agreed to assist, but these second-rate sects were of no real value. Even two Grand Elders at the middle Concentration Soul level was considered good, but they were merely mid-level and low-level Grand Elders. For Qionghua Sect now, it was like a drop of water in a cart—insufficient.

"What to do? Now Qionghua Sect's disciples are panicking! Some have even started fleeing, contacting other sects to switch allegiance!" One Grand Elder's face bore a hint of anxiety as he spoke softly.

"What else can we do? We'll fight to the death!" Several Grand Elders's faces bore madness as they spoke loudly.

...

Three days passed. Luo Tian sat on the ground, eyes closed, his body radiating an invisible aura that continuously pushed against the newly repaired courtyard walls.

Opening his eyes, Luo Tian bore a hint of joy. He inhaled deeply, and the surrounding qi surged into his body.

"Concentration Soul Peak! Now I am truly a great master, aren't I? Among all the world's people, those with my current strength are few and far between!" Luo Tian clenched his fists, feeling his immense power. His face bore confidence.

At this moment, Luo Tian confirmed that if he met Shen Qionghua again, he would not be as helpless as before. Entering the Concentration Soul Peak, he understood why Shen Qionghua felt stronger than ordinary Concentration Soul Peaks who had grasped a fragment of Chaos Power.

"Half-World Lord!" Luo Tian murmured softly, his eyes flashing with intensity.

Indeed, Shen Qionghua was a Half-World Lord. Though she lacked the physical strength of a World Lord and their vast Chaos Power, she possessed features of a World Lord—her domain. Shen Qionghua had grasped a fragment of the domain's subtleties, which was why she felt stronger than others who had grasped a fragment of Chaos Power.

"Indeed, anyone connected to a World Lord's strength is formidable!" Luo Tian muttered, gazing at the vast qi whirlpools in Five Elements Sect's sky. He bore a hint of admiration.

At this moment, Tian Luo and Xu Liyi also slowly emerged from their quarters. Due to the nine-star elixirs, both had entered the Concentration Soul Peak, becoming part of Five Elements Sect's core strength.

Luo Tian saw them and bore a look of joy. Now, Five Elements Sect was at its peak. The Grand Master, the Demon Lord, and other World Lords were present. With Luo Tian's three entering the Concentration Soul Peak, they were immensely powerful.

Previously, five peak Grand Elders had also attained Chaos Power through the Chaos True Luo Elixir. Now Five Elements Sect had six people who had grasped a fragment of Chaos Power—enough to rival several sects.

Concentration Soul Peaks had also increased significantly. Gu Qianxue, Gu Lei, Ji Chen, Lei Yong, Zhang Ziping, and others—nearly a dozen people.

Luo Tian stood in the sky, his face cold as he addressed everyone. "Everyone, seven days have passed. Let's go for a tour of the Southern Region! How about it?"

"Kill..." The Five Elements Sect disciples on the ground bore cold expressions, shouting in unison.

"Go!" Luo Tian sneered, his voice laced with killing intent as he addressed Xu Liyi and others. His body transformed into a seven-colored streak of light, heading toward Feiyan City.

Xu Liyi and Tian Luo also bore smiles as they followed Luo Tian. A group of young people marched in a grand procession toward the Southern Region.

Chapter 707: Establishing Authority

Southern Region, Qionghua Sect.

Once a bustling sect, now it was bleak. As a major sect of the Southern Region, it had nearly a million disciples. But now almost half had fled.

"Seven days have passed. The Five Elements Sect hasn't come. It seems they are afraid of our Qionghua Sect!" The disciples of Qionghua Sect bore confusion, whispering among themselves.

"Hmph! If the Five Elements Sect truly came, they would be wiped out without returning!" A Grand Elder of a second-rate sect, at the middle Concentration Soul level, bore an air of arrogance as he spoke coldly.

"Indeed... they are just a rural sect. How dare they come to our Southern Region?" Other second-rate sects from the South also echoed.

But those dozen Grand Elders of Qionghua Sect bore intense anxiety. They knew Five Elements Sect was now at its peak. Seeing the attitude of other first-rate sects, they understood that no one could provoke Five Elements Sect now.

These past days, the Grand Elders had been on edge, their hair nearly falling out from worry. They had contacted people left and right but achieved nothing.

Time passed slowly. The sun gradually set, and under Qionghua Sect's tense state, time eventually reached dusk.

"Ugh! We've waited a day already. Why hasn't the Five Elements Sect sent anyone yet!"

"Indeed, I think they truly dare not come!" The remaining disciples of Qionghua Sect also murmured, their gazes filled with disdain as they criticized those who had fled out of fear.

"Master Zhang, is the Five Elements Sect really not coming?" A second-rate sect's Grand Elder bore impatience, looking at the eleven Qionghua Sect Grand Elders.

"Boom..." As the Elder's words ended, he transformed into a streak of light and crashed against Qionghua Sect's mountain. He collapsed like a pile of mud on the ground.

"Five Elements Sect, please leave these miscellaneous people. Otherwise, harming innocents would be bad!" A cold voice echoed from the sky, causing a slight shock among Qionghua Sect's people. Especially those Grand Elders at the Concentration Soul Peak, their faces bore fear.

"Grand Elder who has grasped a fragment of Chaos Power!" The people gazed in admiration, watching Luo Tian and others emerge from the sky.

They were few—only a dozen people. But the pressure they radiated was like an immense mountain of heavenly authority, pressing upon Qionghua Sect's people.

"Too young!" Female disciples of Qionghua Sect gazed at the six young men in the sky, their faces filled with disbelief. They had never imagined such youth could reach this height.

"That's right, Master Zhang. I suddenly remembered I have some matters to attend to in my sect! I'll come back tomorrow!" A second-rate sect's Grand Elder smiled, bowing to the eleven Qionghua Sect Grand Elders and vanishing into the distance.

"Master Zhang, I'm feeling unwell today. I'll take my leave!"

"Master Zhang, my wife just gave birth. It's urgent! I'll definitely be there next time!" Other second-rate sect Grand Elders also bore fear, vanishing from Qionghua Sect's territory.

The disciples and elders of Qionghua Sect bore grim faces watching the people leave one by one. But they didn't curse them. Luo Tian's group was too strong; their aura was unbearable for anyone to withstand.

"Luo Tian, don't push us too far. Otherwise we'll have no choice but to destroy everything with you!" A Qionghua Sect elder bore a mad expression as he spoke to Luo Tian's group.

"What do you mean by 'pushing us too far'? When you vowed to destroy our Five Elements Sect's millions of disciples, did you think about what 'pushing us too far' meant? Now it's your turn. You can't fight, so you resort to threats. Destroying everything with us—do you even deserve that?" Xu Liyi, who never backed down when he was right, shouted.

Tian Luo and Gu Lei also echoed in agreement. They had long hated Qionghua Sect.

"You'll agree to let us go, and we'll allow you to choose any of Qionghua Sect's female disciples. We promise from now on, Qionghua Sect will be a subordinate sect of Five Elements Sect!" The elder spoke confidently. This offer would surely tempt Luo Tian.

"Wow! Luo Tian, you've got the entire Qionghua Sect's women as your harem!" Xu Liyi and others looked at Luo Tian with admiration.

"Master Zhang, do you think Luo Tian will agree?" The dozen Qionghua Sect Grand Elders bore a hint of confusion, asking the elder who was conversing with Luo Tian.

"Hmph. How old is he? Can he withstand the temptation of women?" The elder gave them a reassuring look, his voice imprinted in their minds.

Luo Tian stood in the sky, his gaze briefly scanning over Qionghua Sect's women. He nodded inwardly. Indeed, Qionghua Sect was the sect with the most female disciples in the entire Tianyuan Continent. Though these women weren't top-tier, they weren't ordinary either. After so much cultivation, even a pig could become human.

Seeing Luo Tian's gaze, several Qionghua Sect Grand Elders felt reassured. They stood in the sky, waiting for Luo Tian's confirmation.

"Indeed tempting. But in my heart, even the entire Qionghua Sect cannot compare to the life of a single disciple from Five Elements Sect. You kill one of us, I'll destroy your entire sect!" Luo Tian's face bore endless coldness. His hands moved swiftly.

A greenish-blue fire dragon emerged from his hands. Each was nearly a hundred feet long, surrounding the entire Qionghua Sect.

"You!" Seeing Luo Tian turn on them so quickly, every person in Qionghua Sect's upper and lower ranks had their faces change.

If before, Qionghua Sect people wanted to resist, after seeing Luo Tian, Xu Liyi, and Tian Luo—three Grand Elders who had grasped a fragment of Chaos Power—they no longer had the will to resist. Such a powerful formation, three people could walk through the Southern Region unchallenged, becoming guests of honor in major sects. Now Qionghua Sect had finally understood why other sects, after receiving their pleas for help, remained silent and refused.

"Run!" No longer having the will to fight, the dozen Qionghua Sect Grand Elders now thought of fleeing. Their bodies moved, rushing toward the distance.

"Run!" Seeing their Grand Elders flee, Qionghua Sect's disciples who had been proud before now bore pale faces. They cried out, scattering in panic.

"Root them out! We gave you seven days to flee. That was mercy. Now you want to run? It's too late!" Luo Tian stood in the sky, sneering as he grabbed his hand.

Chapter 708: Destruction of Qionghua Sect

Luo Tian's face bore a cold expression. As he had continuously launched fire dragons, now hundreds of thousands surrounded the entire Qionghua Sect. The escape routes of several Grand Elders were sealed by Luo Tian's group, leaving no chance to flee.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian grabbed his hand, a vast firestorm instantly surrounded the entire Qionghua Sect. The terrifying temperature swept through every corner of Qionghua Sect.

"Ah..." In an instant, countless disciples were vaporized without even the chance to struggle.

"Blazing Heaven Fire Array!" Luo Tian's most powerful group attack technique. Now at the Concentration Soul Peak and having grasped a fragment of Chaos Power, its power had finally reached its peak.

The entire Qionghua Sect was engulfed in fire. Countless disciples desperately scattered, but the pressure from Luo Tian's group was too great. The surrounding area was also enclosed by greenish-blue fire, leaving no gap.

"Luo Tian, are we..." Xu Liyi's face bore a hint of reluctance as he spoke to Luo Tian.

"Too cruel?" Luo Tian's eyes were filled with confusion, watching the people crying out in fire. He whispered softly.

Destroying forty or fifty thousand people with a single gesture sounded bold, but doing so was another feeling entirely!

In the depths of his soul, Luo Tian felt countless冤魂 (wronged souls) surrounding him, their grotesque faces biting at him.

"Go..." Luo Tian roared, emitting an invisible wave from his body.

"I have never regretted my actions. Today, if I don't root them out, in the future, Five Elements Sect may face a great crisis. I don't want to see that!" Luo Tian sneered, his voice laced with coldness and indifference.

"One hour... two hours..." Half an hour later, the entire vast Qionghua Sect was reduced to ashes and scattered into the world. Even those dozen Grand Elders were no exception.

"Let's go..." Luo Tian sighed, addressing the people behind him. His body vanished from sight.

...

"Qionghua Sect was destroyed!" As Luo Tian's group left, the entire Tianyuan Continent stirred.

Everywhere discussed the news of Qionghua Sect being destroyed by Luo Tian alone. At this moment, the two names most talked about across the continent were Qionghua Sect and Luo Tian.

"Self-inflicted death. Don't blame others. Did you really think Five Elements Sect was so simple? If it were, the Northern Region's dominance would have changed long ago. It wouldn't be Five Elements Sect that ruled!" The elders of major sects bore mocking expressions, but also more fear toward Five Elements Sect.

"The peak of Five Elements Sect has returned!" The elders of major sects bore nostalgic expressions, recalling the once霸道 (domineering) Five Elements Sect.

Luo Tian was unaware of this. Even if he knew, he wouldn't care. At this moment, Luo Tian and Xu Liyi's group were heading toward the Ice Extreme Island in the Southern Region. After all, arriving at the Southern Region without seeing his parents was unthinkable. Plus, he had learned about his grandfather's news.

They flew leisurely through the region, greeting each sect they passed and giving them many elixirs.

After several days of travel, they finally arrived at the famous dangerous region in the Southern Region—the Ice Extreme Island.

Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei were experiencing the frigid environment of the Ice Extreme Island for the first time, expressing admiration.

"Grand Master!" Seeing Luo Tian arrive, the leading disciples of Ice Extreme Island bore respect. These days, Luo Tian's name had spread across the entire Tianyuan Continent.

"Stupid kid! You still remember to come back!" A cheerful voice echoed, causing Luo Tian's face to bear a hint of joy.

"Qingqing Sister! It's been so long. You've become even more beautiful, and your strength has grown too!" Luo Tian smiled as he watched a graceful figure fly toward them. It could only be Luo Qingqing.

"You stupid kid! You know how to flirt. Introduce your friends to me!" Luo Qingqing smiled, speaking to Luo Tian with a gentle gaze. Clearly, she missed her brother.

"Qingqing Sister, have you missed me?" Xu Liyi stepped forward with a flirtatious grin.

"Go away! You're such a dirty talker. Luo Tian, stay away from this scoundrel. He's definitely not a good person!" Luo Qingqing kicked Xu Liyi in the butt, sending him flying. Though Xu Liyi was powerful, he seemed to enjoy it and didn't dodge, taking the kick.

"What's wrong with this kid?" Gu Lei and Tian Luo bore surprised expressions watching Xu Liyi.

"Come on, I'll take you to meet your father and mother!" Luo Qingqing smiled, ignoring Xu Liyi flying far away. She took Luo Tian's hand and led him toward the main residence of Ice Extreme Island.

"Little one!" Seeing Luo Tian, his mother bore an expression of excitement. She pulled him close, looking at him from left to right with deep concern.

"Son, since you've come out of the Xian Gu Relic Area, come out! With your current strength, neither I nor your father can match you. In the entire Tianyuan Continent, you could walk freely!" Luo Nantian's face bore a sense of admiration as he watched his son surpass him.

The entire Luo family was amazed at Luo Tian's attainment of a great master.

Luo Han had returned days ago, and his progress speed had already shocked Ice Extreme Island's people. Now Luo Tian was even more astonishing, becoming a Concentration Soul Peak and having grasped a fragment of Chaos Power.

"My god! This kid isn't human!" The Luo family's faces twitched as they watched Luo Tian chatting with Luo Nantian.

"Y-You..." Gu Qianxue stood frozen, her face filled with disbelief. Her eyes became slightly red as she lowered her head.

Noticing Gu Qianxue's change, Luo Tian smiled. "Father, Mother, this is your future daughter-in-law. You can call her Qianxue!"

"Ha! This girl is good!" Luo Nantian laughed heartily, his face filled with satisfaction. Gu Qianxue's cultivation and beauty were top-tier; Luo Nantian was naturally satisfied.

"How about it? You're surprised to see me, right?" Zhang Qiuyue smiled at Gu Qianxue's red face.

Chapter 709: Gathering in the Northern Region's Five Elements Sect

Gu Qianxue stood red-faced in the hall. She recalled her stubbornness back when she was at the Yellowneck Sect, and how she had coldly rejected that white-cloaked woman. She never imagined that the woman who had severed Yellowneck Mountain with a single sword was Luo Tian's mother.

"Little girl, do you remember me? Back then, you said you had a lover and didn't want to be my daughter-in-law!" Zhang Qiuyue smiled, continuing as she saw Gu Qianxue's red face.

"This... " Gu Qianxue was mortified, her eyes seeking help from Luo Tian.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian also stood stunned, unsure of what connection his mother and Gu Qianxue had.

"Ah! I remember now. You're the one who severed Yellowneck Mountain!" Gu Lei seemed to recall something and spoke loudly.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian turned, asking Gu Lei.

Gu Lei also bore a strange expression as he looked at Gu Qianxue, recounting the events. The others chuckled.

Luo Tian smiled and pulled Gu Qianxue's hand up, leading her to his mother Zhang Qiuyue. "Mother, don't tease Qianxue anymore. She's easily embarrassed!"

Luo Tian emphasized the words "embarrassed," causing Gu Lei to grimace. He secretly marveled at how his sister had ever been associated with embarrassment.

"Alright, alright..." Zhang Qiuyue pulled Gu Qianxue over and started chatting with her.

Luo Tian's return had made the Ice Extreme Island not exactly celebratory, but the main family of Luo was overjoyed.

Luo Nantian and Luo Tian also discussed the current state of Ice Extreme Island. With Luo Nantian's return, there were no more disputes within the Luo family. Now, Luo Nantian's lineage held absolute authority in Ice Extreme Island.

In the following days, Luo Tian didn't idle. He extensively cultivated elixirs in Ice Extreme Island, causing the entire family to be stunned. Upon learning that Luo Tian had become a nine-star alchemist, it even shocked the elders of Ice Extreme Island.

Elixirs continuously flowed from Luo Tian's hands, and the strength of Ice Extreme Island steadily increased.

After staying in Ice Extreme Island for several days, Luo Tian and his group bid farewell to Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiuyue, returning to Five Elements Sect.

Time passed slowly. Only three and a half months remained until the battle Luo Xiong had spoken of.

That day, the Grand Master and several other elders of Five Elements Sect, along with Luo Tian's group, sat in the hall.

"Only three and a half months remain. The Wangyue Sect will initiate war. Relying solely on Five Elements Sect is still insufficient. I've already sent messages to various sects, asking them to come to Five Elements Sect and discuss how to deal with this life-or-death battle for the entire Tianyuan Continent!" The Grand Master's face bore a serious expression.

As his words ended, the skies above Five Elements Sect echoed with breaking sounds. Several figures appeared in the sky.

"Grand Master, Feiyun Sect's old friend has arrived!" An elderly figure appeared in the sky. It was none other than the tomb guardian of Feiyun Sect, accompanied by its sect's Grand Master, Nan Gong Xiu.

"Grand Master, Jinglei Sect's Ying Tianlei has arrived..." The breaking sounds continued. The skies above Five Elements Sect were filled with figures, as elders of major sects from the Northern Region appeared alongside their disciples.

"Buzz..." The Grand Master waved his hand, and Luo Tian's group appeared on Five Elements Sect's plaza.

Seeing the many elderly faces, the Grand Master smiled slightly. "I never expected that those of you who were merely at the Concentration Soul Realm back then have now become sect elders. You've grasped a fragment of Chaos Power and reached the Concentration Soul Peak. It seems it was correct to preserve you all back then. Otherwise, facing this battle now, I would have been alone and struggling."

Luo Tian looked at the unfamiliar faces in the sky. He never expected that such a small Northern Region had so terrifying strength. The skies above held over twenty Grand Elders who had grasped a fragment of Chaos Power, and they were all elders—excluding figures like Ying Hongtu or Chen Changsheng.

"Enough. Everyone has arrived, so come down. Wait for the other regions' elders to arrive before we thoroughly discuss!" The Grand Master spoke, raising his hand. A series of stone tables appeared in the sky.

The group bore respectful expressions toward the elderly Grand Master seated at the head. They followed protocol, making Luo Tian and his group laugh silently. How could these sect elders, who had grasped a fragment of Chaos Power, appear so childlike before the Grand Master?

"Luo Tian, let you handle these young people. Don't involve us old-timers!" Seeming to notice Luo Tian's group's discomfort, the Grand Master smiled and spoke to Luo Tian.

"Yes!" Luo Tian didn't dare delay. He nodded toward the younger generation and led them to Five Elements Sect's training ground.
