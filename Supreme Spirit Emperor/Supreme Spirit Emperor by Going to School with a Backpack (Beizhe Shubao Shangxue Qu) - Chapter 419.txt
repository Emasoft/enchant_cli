“Star and Moon Convergence Technique!” Fu Tu's expression was equally solemn. A moon and a star materialized in his hands, then collided violently under his control, unleashing waves of destruction that could shatter heaven and earth. The tremors surged upward from Fu Tu's head, striking Luo Tian with immense force.

“Boom... Boom... Boom...” The thunderous roars echoed endlessly, filling the void with a cacophony of destruction. Star and Moon Divine Clan members gazed in terror, their minds filled with dread as the fluctuations in the void threatened to annihilate them completely.

“How is it going?” Soon after, all of them—including Fu Xingyang—held their breath, uncertain about the outcome of the battle in the void.

“Pf!” Luo Tian's massive body collapsed vast stretches of space, blood spewing from his mouth as he stepped out of the chaotic void.

“Bane God Again Treads to Shatter the Stars!” Luo Tian wiped the blood from his lips, taking another step forward. The power of this second stride was nearly double that of the first.

“After all these years, you haven’t improved at all!” Observing Luo Tian’s second step, the first strike had indeed been formidable. However, it was merely the first of Bane God’s Seven Steps. Even with their combined strength, Luo Tian had suffered considerable damage.

“If you insist on gathering your power, I’ll deny you that chance!” Fu Tu’s face twisted with ferocity. Having fought Luo Tian twice, they had begun to grasp the nature of Bane God’s Seven Steps. The initial steps were merely preparation; if Luo Tian had unleashed the seventh step directly, its power would not have been so overwhelming.

“Divine Wound!” Sun Huyang’s face twisted with cruelty. His hands moved, and golden blades of light shot forth from his palms. The blades severed the void, instantly illuminating it with their radiance. A strange aura spread through the void, subtly affecting the minds of those present.

“Hum...” The effect lasted only a moment. Luo Tian’s massive foot hesitated slightly before being struck by the golden blade, blood gushing from his leg.

“Today, you shall perish!” Nan Gong Wu’ai’s face was cold as he watched Sun Huyang’s blade wound Luo Tian. He spoke with a chilling voice, and a black demonic seal flew from his hands. The seal radiated dark demonic flames. Though small, it filled Luo Tian with grim determination.

On the other side, Fu Tu’s hands also shifted. A cold crescent moon emerged from his palms and rushed toward Luo Tian with a crushing force.

“Do you think your strength is enough to judge?” Luo Tian’s voice was cold as he observed their attacks. Yet, his heart secretly marveled at the power of the offspring of the Ancient King and the Master of Epochs. Such techniques would have been fatal for any ordinary Grandmaster or Epoch Master.

But who was Luo Tian? He had mastered the techniques of an Epoch Master and possessed a superhuman body. Ordinary martial arts could barely harm him.

“Sever Heaven Seal!” However, Luo Tian dared not face their attacks head-on. If he were struck by all three techniques, his situation would be dire. This was a life-or-death battle, and he could not afford the slightest mistake.

“Divine King’s Nine Heavens Diagram!” Luo Tian's left hand formed the Sever Heaven Seal, while his right conjured the Divine King’s Nine Heavens Diagram. Standing in the void, his white robes fluttered like a legendary warrior. Two techniques burst forth from his hands, colliding head-on with Fu Tu and Nan Gong Wu’ai’s attacks.

“Want me to stop gathering power? I’ll show you!” Luo Tian's face was cold. As the two techniques left his hands, he raised his massive foot and stomped toward Sun Huyang and the others.

“How is this possible!” The shock on Sun Huyang’s face was unmistakable.

“Can he really perform three techniques at once? Doesn’t he fear his meridians rupturing?” Fu Tu’s voice was filled with disbelief. They had never before seen anyone perform three techniques simultaneously. Even they could manage only two at most.

Performing multiple techniques required immense Epoch Power to sustain, not to mention the mental strain. The greatest challenge was directing the Epoch Power through each meridian without chaos, which could result in self-harm.

“Damn it!” As the three of them were stunned, a thunderous roar echoed above their heads. The Divine King’s Nine Heavens Diagram and the Sever Heaven Seal clashed with Fu Tu and Sun Huyang's techniques, sending waves of energy crashing onto Luo Tian’s golden body.

At the same time, Luo Tian's massive foot came down with a resounding crash, pressing toward them. They had no choice but to resist.

“Bane God’s Third Step Shocks the Gods... Bane God’s Fourth Step... Bane God’s Fifth Step Trembles the World!” Luo Tian did not hesitate. Each step he took sent his aura surging higher.

Sun Huyang and the others were also great masters. Though Luo Tian’s initial steps were overwhelmingly powerful, each step sent them lower, blood spewing from their mouths. Yet Luo Tian knew that harming them was impossible.

“Bane God’s Sixth Step Shatters the Heavens!” His golden foot erupted with power, marking the true beginning of his killing strike. Luo Tian was confident that even Sun Huyang and the others would bleed in his sixth step.

His golden foot, covered with intricate Bane patterns, unleashed a devastating force. The techniques of Divine Annihilation and the Power to Shatter All Methods were also infused into this step, making it unparalleled. Even if Bane God himself had attempted the Seven Steps at the Grandmaster level, achieving this would have been impossible.

“Boom... Boom...” A tremendous pressure enveloped Sun Huyang, Fu Tu, and Nan Gong Wu’ai. Their faces turned pale instantly.

“How could he be so strong!” The three of them felt a deep sense of resentment, their fear growing as they sensed the immense pressure beneath this step.

“Fighting to the end!” They were not ordinary people. As offspring of supreme beings, they could not allow themselves to fail once, let alone twice—especially when three of them were attacking one.

“Luo Tian! Even if you are so strong, what can you do? You must not have anticipated that we possess Epoch Treasures!” Sun Huyang’s face twisted with cruelty. His hands formed a seal, and brilliant light flared around him. A golden divine sword instantly hovered above his head.

“Let this end! Star and Moon Divine Spear!” Fu Tu’s face twisted with cruelty. Luminous stars rose, as the Star and Moon Divine Spear materialized in his hands.

The humming echoed. A black demonic sword also appeared above Nan Gong Wu’ai’s head. Three Epoch Treasures radiated overwhelming power, their aura echoing through the void.

“Hum...” The golden sword soared across the sky. In an instant, it expanded in size under Sun Huyang’s control, sweeping toward Luo Tian’s massive body.

At the same time, Fu Tu and Nan Gong Wu’ai also activated their supreme weapons, attacking Luo Tian with a decisive strike.

One King’s Weapon and two Epoch Treasures formed an ultimate attack under Fu Tu's group, striking Luo Tian with a devastating force.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s face darkened instantly. Three Epoch Treasures had brought him a great sense of crisis.

“Eight Directions of Treasure Retrieval!” However, Luo Tian did not abandon his attack. His hands emitted an invisible wave, sweeping over the Star and Moon Divine Spear.

Chapter 1645: Mutual Destruction?

The void kept fracturing and healing. The Star and Moon Divine Clan members could only witness the dazzling light and the suffocating aura that constantly emanated from the void.

“Ah, it’s the aura of a King’s Weapon!” Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingxuan’s faces changed instantly. Their eyes turned toward the void, their concern deepening.

“Three King’s Weapons! How can Luo Tian withstand it!” Fu Xingyang's eyes reflected despair. Three Epoch Treasures were enough to destroy an ancient king clan. Even if Luo Tian was so extraordinary, he did not believe that Luo Tian could withstand it.

Hearing Fu Xingyang’s words, Fu Xingxuan's face also turned worried. Luo Tian was indeed powerful, but three King’s Weapons were enough to make anyone despair.

“Boom... Boom...” The aura of destruction swept over Luo Tian. Invisible waves shot from his hands, enveloping the Star and Moon Divine Spear and forcing it to change direction.

“Crack...” Twin-colored lightning surrounded the scene. The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword instantly shot from Luo Tian’s hands, striking the Divine Emperor Sword.

“Roar!” Luo Tian roared into the sky. His sixth step did not target Nan Gong Wu’ai’s demonic sword but instead aimed at all three of them.

“Mutual destruction?” Seeing Luo Tian's move, Sun Huyang’s face lit up with joy.

Luo Tian’s sixth step had indeed sent them into crisis, but they were confident that they could survive it. However, Nan Gong Wu’ai’s demonic sword would also strike Luo Tian. The power of an Epoch Treasure was not something anyone could withstand!

“You’re seeking death!” Sun Huyang and the others sneered. They channeled their Epoch Power, forming a barrier to protect themselves.

“Crack...” In an instant, the golden foot crashed into their hastily formed barrier. A thunderous crackling sound echoed in their ears.

As expected, the black demonic sword, radiating a dark glow, sliced through Luo Tian’s massive body. Golden divine blood spilled from his body.

“Boom...” On the other side, the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword and the Divine Emperor Sword collided. In the vast expanse of the void, divine laws and thunderous energy surged upward, filling the void completely.

“Pf!” Sun Huyang’s group spat blood. Their bodies were riddled with cracks from Luo Tian's sixth step, as if they could collapse at any moment. They stood amidst the thunder and divine laws, gazing toward Luo Tian.

However, their faces changed wildly in an instant. They could not believe that Luo Tian had survived the attack of Nan Gong Wu’ai’s fully powered Epoch Treasure.

Luo Tian was covered in golden divine blood. A deep gash ran from his head to his feet, exposing golden bones as if splitting him in two. His appearance was terrifying.

At the same time, Luo Tian’s massive body began to shrink rapidly, returning to normal human size. His eyes reflected a lingering fear.

“Too dangerous!” Luo Tian trembled, silently cursing his underestimation of the power of an Epoch Treasure. He had believed his body was strong enough to withstand a single strike from an Epoch Treasure.

But the power of an Epoch Treasure, when wielded by a Grandmaster, was equivalent to a full-force attack from the Master of Epochs. That Luo Tian had survived without dying was already a miracle.

“Impossible! He actually withstood an attack from an Epoch Treasure!” The three of them spoke in disbelief, staring at Luo Tian as if he were a monster.

Although Luo Tian had suffered heavy injuries, they believed that his survival was already a miracle. Throughout history, no one had ever survived an attack from an Epoch Treasure wielded by a Grandmaster.

“Kill him!” Seeing Luo Tian’s injuries, Sun Huyang, Fu Tu, and Nan Gong Wu’ai's faces turned cold. They activated their three supreme treasures again, attacking Luo Tian with a devastating force.

“See how long you can endure!” They growled, their eyes filled with satisfaction. Though they had also suffered injuries, compared to Luo Tian, they were far stronger.

However, as the three treasures returned to their heads, a powerful vitality radiated from Luo Tian. His blood and qi surged, rapidly healing his wounds.

“Bane God’s Seventh Step Shatters the Ancient!” Luo Tian roared. A phantom of Bane God materialized behind him, and his golden foot, radiating destruction, pressed toward the three of them again.

“Damn it! He still has the strength to fight!” Seeing Luo Tian’s seventh step, Sun Huyang's face turned ashen. At this moment, they finally felt the gap between themselves and Luo Tian—enough to fill them with despair.

“Boom... Boom...” The golden foot seemed to crush everything. It stepped from the distant ancient times, crossing the river of time. Though not as powerful as Bane God himself, its power was nearly equivalent to that of an Epoch Treasure. Its aura shook the heavens.

“Destroy...” Sun Huyang’s group looked mad, their fear of Luo Tian growing. They felt a massive threat that would prevent them from competing with Luo Tian in the future. This life was destined to be crushed by Luo Tian.

Thinking of this, they poured their blood into the three supreme treasures. The three treasures radiated a devastating aura, sweeping across the surroundings. Just this aura alone could annihilate many Epoch Masters.

The three supreme treasures unleashed their terrifying power, as if the being that had swept across nine heavens and ten earths had returned. And in an instant, three of them attacked Luo Tian.

Another ultimate strike. This time, Sun Huyang’s group was certain that even if Luo Tian was so extraordinary, he would inevitably bleed here. These three treasures were enough to destroy any Grandmaster, including superpowerful beings who had lived through a second life.

“Endless Sword!” Luo Tian held the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, his feet stomping with Bane God’s Seven Steps. The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword also unleashed unprecedented power, rushing toward the Divine Emperor Sword.

“Master Yin Fish, block it once!” Luo Tian waved his hand. The black Yin Fish flew from his hands.

“Good!” This time, the Yin Fish did not complain. It radiated a series of dark glows and rushed toward the demonic sword without hesitation.

“Divine Annihilation!” Luo Tian roared. As he took steps, the Divine Annihilation technique was continuously manifested. An ancient palace emerged from his hands and pressed toward the Star and Moon Divine Spear.

“This...” Seeing Luo Tian instantly unleashing an attack comparable to three Epoch Treasures, Sun Huyang’s group was completely stunned.

But they were stunned and forgot about Luo Tian's seventh step. This attack was equally formidable.

“Boom...” In an instant, the golden foot crashed onto their bodies. Their already injured bodies were instantly crushed into three blood mists, floating in the void.

“Die!” Luo Tian’s face was cold. He waved his hands, and a powerful spiritual force combined with seven-colored flames spread out, sweeping toward the blood mists and spiritual essences of the three.

“Boom...” However, as soon as Luo Tian launched his attack, a thunderous explosion echoed in his ears. At the same time, six Epoch Treasures-level collisions also occurred.

Destruction. The entire void was swept by a powerful energy, annihilating everything in its path.

“Ah...” Luo Tian roared into the sky. He no longer cared about killing Sun Huyang, Fu Tu, and Nan Gong Wu’ai.

But even Luo Tian found it difficult to withstand the collision of six Epoch Treasures. In the ultimate pain, he was also hit and turned into a blood mist.

This powerful wave, though in the void, still spread throughout the entire Thunder Domain. The ancient tribes of the domain were all shaken, their eyes filled with fear.

“What is this energy?” All the ancient king tribes turned their gaze toward the Star and Moon Divine Clan's land. They could feel that this energy came from the direction of the Star and Moon Divine Clan.

“Let’s go see. This energy is enough to destroy everything. What happened with the Star and Moon Divine Clan?” Almost instantly, a large number of ancient tribes' strong warriors rushed toward the Star and Moon Divine Clan's land.

At this moment, the Star and Moon Divine Clan was in ruins. Almost all of its buildings had collapsed. Only the central Star and Moon Divine Temple remained standing. This temple was a sacred treasure brought from the origin domain of the Star and Moon Divine Clan, which was why it had endured.

However, the people of the Star and Moon Divine Clan did not care about the collapsed buildings. They gazed at the vast destruction in the void, unable to blink even for a moment. They wanted to know who had won this battle, as it determined the fate of the Star and Moon Divine Clan.

“Could it be mutual destruction? Who could withstand such power?” Time passed slowly. After a half-hour of silence, the people of the Star and Moon Divine Clan began to murmur.

“Mutual destruction would be good. Then we, the Star and Moon Divine Clan, wouldn’t have to pay for four King’s Weapons!” Some of the people in the Star and Moon Divine Clan became excited.

“Hum...” However, as soon as these murmurs were spoken, they felt a slight chill on their necks. They saw Fu Xingxuan’s gaze, which was as cold as ice.

“Do you all think that way?” Fu Xingxuan spoke softly, her voice cold and carrying a hint of killing intent.

Chapter 1646: Supreme Beings

“N-No...” Feeling Fu Xingyue’s killing intent, the people of the Star and Moon Divine Clan quickly withdrew their words. They thought about Fu Xingyue’s ambiguous relationship with Luo Tian.

The entire world fell silent. Everyone gazed at the gradually healing void, their eyes filled with reverence.

In the void, the Star and Moon Divine Spear, the Demon Emperor Sword, the Divine Emperor Sword, the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, and the Yin Fish floated there. Though they had not collided further, these five terrifying treasures radiated light, as if engaging in a different kind of confrontation.

“Hum...” A mass of golden divine blood emitted a humming sound, gradually coalescing into Luo Tian’s pale face. His eyes carried admiration.

“Too dangerous...” Luo Tian whispered to himself, gazing at the five treasures still clashing. Then his gaze turned toward Sun Huyang’s group.

That collision had nearly annihilated him. He did not believe they were any better off than himself.

But his gaze found no signs of life. This confused him slightly.

“Did they really die?”

“No! My curse didn’t activate!” However, his mind jolted. He knew they were not dead because of the curse on him. If Fu Tu had died, his curse would have activated.

“Hum...” As Luo Tian was confused, waves of energy spread from the Star and Moon Divine Spear, the Demon Emperor Sword, and the Divine Emperor Sword. Three-colored light enveloped them. At the same time, Fu Tu, Sun Huyang, and Nan Gong Wu’ai appeared in Luo Tian’s vision with pale faces.

“Luo Tian…” Seeing Luo Tian unharmed, their faces turned even more grim. At that moment of greatest difficulty, the three Epoch Treasures had saved them.

But Luo Tian was unharmed as well. He had also survived, though his cultivation had dropped.

“Kill…” Seeing them appear, Luo Tian’s face was filled with killing intent again. He moved toward them.

But as soon as he took a step, the Star and Moon Divine Spear, the Demon Emperor Sword, and the Divine Emperor Sword emitted thunderous roars. Light radiated again, and three supreme figures appeared in Luo Tian’s vision.

“What is this…” Luo Tian stopped instantly. His gaze turned to the three figures, his heart filled with fear.

Not only was Luo Tian stunned, but Sun Huyang and Fu Tu’s group were also dumbfounded. They did not know why such a change had occurred.

“Father!” However, after seeing these three figures, their faces turned to excitement. They had not expected to see their fathers under such circumstances. Though they were not true bodies, the power radiating from these three figures was overwhelming, like a mountain that one could only look up to.

“Epoch Master…” Luo Tian then understood the identity of these three figures. After all, a residual image could possess such power—only an Epoch Master or a saint could do that. He could not think of anyone else who could achieve this.

“Hum...” However, before Luo Tian could marvel, the Yin Fish and the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword also emitted humming sounds. Two more figures coalesced, equally powerful.

“Another two…” However, Luo Tian’s face turned grim. He looked at these two figures and his lips twitched.

“How did this happen? Did the collision of several treasures awaken the wills left by our ancestors?” Fu Tu, Nan Gong Wu’ai’s group looked at these figures with reverence. Even though they were not true bodies, they dared not be disrespectful.

Five figures stood there, as if ignoring the words of Sun Huyang’s group. A sense of opportunity connected these supreme beings, and they gazed at each other.

As if silently communicating, the Epoch Master of the Divine Clan and the Epoch Master of the Demon Clan showed a hint of reverence, gazing at the old man in black and white Daoist robes.

“Is that the Divine and Demon Master?” Luo Tian gazed at this supreme figure. Even among the five Epoch Masters, he appeared unusually tall.

“But what about the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword?” He then looked at the figure beside the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword. This figure was one he had never seen before.

“Could it be... the father of Master Mei? The residual image of the Fallen Heaven Saint?” Luo Tian’s face showed disbelief. He looked at this old man with a scholarly aura, but his eyes were slightly vacant, as if bound by some rules.

“Not possible!” Luo Tian’s heart was in turmoil. He did not know who this old man was, but his power rivaled that of the Divine and Demon Master.

“Boom... Boom...” However, soon after, several figures began to fight in Luo Tian’s group's vision. A destructive aura returned to the void.

“Kid, watch carefully. These figures are not their true bodies but possess two-thirds of their strength. If it weren’t for the collision of several ultimate weapons, these figures would never have appeared!” The voice of Yin Fish’s spirit echoed in Luo Tian's mind, weakly. Obviously, the collision had also drained Yin Fish, but it was much stronger than before.

“This is the method left by the Epoch Masters. They were undefeated, but they sought to have some interaction with other Epoch Masters!”

“Watch carefully. If you can grasp anything, it will help you in the future when you reach that level!” Yin Fish continued to explain.

“Ah, I see now!” Luo Tian whispered. He then looked at Sun Huyang, Fu Tu, and Nan Gong Wu’ai. Seeing that they had no intention of attacking him, his heart relaxed.

“Come up! There's a cultivation opportunity here!” He then sent a mental message to Fu Xingxuan and Fu Xingyang. Fu Xingyang was at the Grandmaster level, while Fu Xingxuan was just one step away from being a Grandmaster. This battle might help them.

“Hum...” Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingxuan heard Luo Tian’s mental message. Their minds were stirred, their eyes filled with joy. They had been worried about Luo Tian’s safety before, but now hearing his voice again, their hearts finally calmed.

In an instant, Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingxuan appeared in the void. They saw Luo Tian and Sun Huyang’s group, but more importantly, they noticed the five figures clashing in the distance.

“They...” They soon recognized one of them, who was the King of the Star and Moon Divine Clan worshipped by their clan for generations.

“Watch carefully!” Luo Tian spoke to them, his eyes filled with excitement. He then said nothing more and stared intently at the five fighting.

The Epoch Masters of the Divine Clan and the Demon Clan, since they were father-son to the Divine and Demon Master, did not attack him but instead faced the old man who seemed chaotic. Meanwhile, the Divine and Demon Master fought against the King of the Star and Moon Divine Clan.

The battle between these five was overwhelming, with no martial arts used. Yet each collision annihilated vast stretches of the void, matching the power of an Epoch Treasure’s collision.

Luo Tian and his group stood under the protection of the Epoch Treasures, watching the five fight. Their eyes were filled with awe and joy as waves of power continuously battered the barrier cast by the Epoch Treasures.

“Thankfully, we have the Epoch Treasures. Otherwise, this energy alone would annihilate most of the Epoch Masters!” Fu Xingyang whispered.

“Boom... Boom... Boom...” The thunderous roars echoed endlessly. Though the Divine and Demon Master and the chaotic old man fought against three opponents, they managed to suppress them. Especially this chaotic old man was terrifyingly powerful. Even fighting two opponents, he continuously pushed back the Divine and Demon Clan's supreme beings.

“Monstrous!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed admiration. He had thought himself strong enough to escape from an Epoch Master, but now seeing the battle of five, he realized his mistake. Though only one level apart, it was a difference between heaven and earth. If he met a true Epoch Master, his strength might withstand several blows but would be annihilated completely.

The battle of the five seemed simple, yet it contained the principles of Dao and reason. It shattered time's river, destroyed order, and crossed from different eras as if multiple skies collided in the void. They were masters of the world, wielding supreme Dao.

“Rules... Dao!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed confusion. He then gazed at the stars through the void, as if he had understood something but still had many questions.

“How can one take that step?” Luo Tian whispered to himself. Though he was now powerful and even fearless against those who had lived through a second life, he still did not know how to cultivate the Dao.

“Cultivating the Dao—cultivating one's own path or another’s?” Fu Xingxuan also showed confusion. However, she soon stopped watching the five's battle and sat in meditation under the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword. Her body radiated waves.

“Xingxuan is about to break through!” Seeing Fu Xingxuan's actions, Luo Tian and Fu Xingyang’s faces showed a hint of joy. They had not expected Fu Xingxuan to show signs of breakthrough after watching the battle.

Time passed slowly. An hour had quickly gone by, and the five great beings' battle finally ended.

The five figures vanished in their final collision. However, no one had won. Though the Divine and Demon Master and the chaotic old man had suppressed three opponents, they had not shattered them.

“Hum...” As the five figures vanished, the five supreme treasures above their heads dimmed in power.

“Creating such powerful figures was all thanks to the Epoch Treasures’ strength. The Epoch Treasures can no longer unleash their past power!” Yin Fish’s voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

Chapter 1647: The Threat of the Tribes

The five supreme treasures returned to their hands. Then, Luo Tian and Fu Xingyang turned their gaze toward Fu Tu and Sun Huyang’s group.

As Luo Tian and Fu Xingyang looked at them, Sun Huyang and Nan Gong Wu’ai also gazed at Luo Tian’s group. Their eyes met, instantly sparking a fire.

“Then let's continue!” Luo Tian’s face was cold. He moved forward, rushing toward Sun Huyang and the others.

“I’ll help you!” Fu Xingyang’s face also carried hatred. At this moment, Fu Tu and the others had also regenerated their blood, their cultivation dropped to the Epoch Master level. Fu Xingyang was confident that against one of them, he would not be as helpless as before.

“Damn it!” Seeing Luo Tian and Fu Xingyang rushing toward them, their faces changed. Their current state was also poor. Luo Tian had previously fought three opponents and tied them evenly, but now with Fu Xingyang added, it was different.

Though they looked down on Fu Xingyang, they could not deny that he could hold one of them at bay.

The most terrifying thing was Fu Xingxuan, who sat in the void with her power rising. She seemed to be on the verge of breaking through to Grandmaster.

If they were at their peak, they would not fear Fu Xingxuan’s breakthrough to Grandmaster. But now, a Grandmaster could change too much.

“Let’s go!” They were not fools. The situation was extremely unfavorable for them. If they did not leave now, it would be a waste of their lives.

“Hum...” The three Epoch Treasures had dimmed in brilliance but were still powerful. They forced their power, and the gray void was torn open. Without hesitation, they rushed out.

“Flee?” As he flew, Luo Tian sensed their intention. His face turned cold. The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword instantly appeared in his hand.

“Go!” Luo Tian formed seals with his hands. Complex symbols covered the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, and he pushed it forward. The sword became a streak of light, disappearing from Luo Tian’s sight before the void could heal.

“Fled!” Fu Xingyang stood in front of Luo Tian. He knew that if they truly wanted to flee, neither he nor Luo Tian could stop them at their current state.

“Hmph!” Luo Tian nodded. He had expected this outcome. Unless they wanted to fight him to the end, he could not stop them either.

“First battle. The results are quite good!” Luo Tian’s face showed a slight smile. Though his face was pale, he felt satisfied. After all, defeating three Grandmaster heirs was a feat that would make anyone proud.

“Hum...” As Luo Tian and Fu Xingyang spoke, the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword sliced through the void and returned to Luo Tian’s hand. Its blue blade was stained with blood.

“Just wounded. This should make them stay away for a while!” Luo Tian whispered to himself, but his mind was filled with confusion.

“How did these three get together?” Luo Tian’s mind was puzzled. He felt that a terrifying hidden force was scheming in the Nine Realms.

“Could it be the All-Heaven Alliance?” He then thought of the newly established alliance in the Star and Moon Domain. To date, no one had discovered who founded it or its main figures.

“Time to go check the Star and Moon Domain!” He then whispered to himself, taking the All-Heaven Alliance seriously.

“Let’s go out first. Let Xingxuan stay here; the energy here is beneficial for her breakthrough!” Luo Tian’s face showed a light smile. He gazed at Fu Xingxuan, whose power was rising.

“Hmph!” Fu Xingyang nodded. At this moment, both of them were in poor condition. Plus, the Star and Moon Divine Clan had a pile of ruins to deal with.

“Hum...” Their faces were pale as they tore through the void and appeared on the Star and Moon Divine Clan’s land. The people who had been watching the Star and Moon Divine Clan immediately showed joy on their faces.

The previous battle of five supreme beings had made them feel suffocated. That overwhelming pressure had cost the Star and Moon Divine Clan many lives.

“Hush...” The murmurs spread through the Star and Moon Divine Clan. Then came a thunderous cheer, for Luo Tian had won. Thus, the Star and Moon Divine Clan would return to its usual state.

“Sigh...” Fu Xingyang sighed deeply, his eyes filled with sorrow. Though they had won, it was a costly victory. This battle had cost the Star and Moon Divine Clan heavily.

The bloodstains on the ground were from the three divisions of the Star and Moon Divine Clan. They also included Kou Tien De and Fu Zhiming, who had both perished completely. These two were pillars of the Star and Moon Divine Clan. Their deaths were a heavy loss for the clan.

“Alright, everyone should start rebuilding the land first!” Fu Xingyang quickly addressed the Star and Moon Divine Clan people. He had no time to recover, so he immediately began gathering the remaining members of the Star and Moon Divine Clan to start working.

People looked at Luo Tian with reverence. After all, the Star and Moon Divine Clan had achieved its current state through this person’s battle.

“Sigh...” Luo Tian also sighed deeply. He had a deep bond with the Star and Moon Guard, and this battle had cost them half their strength. He felt a sense of sorrow.

However, Luo Tian knew that he needed to recover his cultivation first. After all, this domain was now the territory of the ancient tribes. Plus, his identity had been exposed. If a Grandmaster attacked him, he would not be able to withstand it at his current state.

With that thought, Luo Tian moved forward again and entered the void. He sat in front of Fu Xingxuan, took out pills, and began to recover.

At this moment, the Star and Moon Divine Clan’s land was also filled with people. Each one had a look of fear, gazing at the Star and Moon Divine Clan’s land.

Some people had arrived at the Star and Moon Divine Clan's land long ago but hadn’t dared to enter. The reason was that the previous energy had been so terrifying, it was beyond their ability to withstand.

Time passed slowly. The people outside the Star and Moon Divine Clan's land grew more numerous. After three days, the Star and Moon Divine Clan people had restored most of their land.

However, after three days, no secret could remain hidden. The news of Luo Tian’s arrival had spread among the Star and Moon Divine Clan people, so it was impossible to keep it quiet.

“Luo Tian! It’s the human race's Luo Tian. Is he coming to trouble the Star and Moon Divine Clan?”
