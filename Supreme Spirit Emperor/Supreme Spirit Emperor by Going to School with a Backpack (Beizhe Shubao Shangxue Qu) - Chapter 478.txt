“Broken Dragon Stone, has it been in the Jade Carving Shop for nearly a decade?”
“Yes, he must be unaware of the value of the Broken Dragon Stone. If he knew, he would have retreated!”
“The Broken Dragon Stone gives an overwhelming impression and is inscrutable, but no one knows what lies within. It might just be a powerful spiritual aura!” The crowd murmured among themselves.
“Originally priced at fifteen thousand spirit energy stones, but today I acquired a Spirit Crystal. The Broken Dragon Stone has been in my Jade Carving Shop for ten years, and no one dared to open it. Today I shall take the initiative—eight thousand spirit energy stones!” Fang Zhengyang’s face bore a faint smile, his eyes brimming with anticipation. He too wished to uncover what lay within the stone that had eluded all for a decade.
“Good!” Luo Tian furrowed his brow slightly before extending his hand, retrieving eight thousand spirit energy stones from his storage ring and placing them into a storage bag, which he handed to Fang Zhengyang.
“Damn it! This fool actually intends to buy the Broken Dragon Stone! That’s eight thousand spirit energy stones—surely he’ll lose everything! Even Master Heo dared not open it, yet this kid dares to!” The crowd’s faces bore astonishment, expecting a纨绔 (luxurious aristocrat), but this one was excessively extravagant. Eight thousand spirit energy stones could buy an entire city.
“Ha! A true man of generosity, I’ve witnessed youth with talent!” Fang Zhengyang laughed heartily, praising Luo Tian.
“Truly wasteful!” Others watched Luo Tian with a voyeuristic gaze, eager to see his downfall.
“Friend, do you wish me to find someone to open the stone for you, or will you do it yourself?” Fang Zhengyang asked Luo Tian.
“Please have the manager assist me,” Luo Tian smiled, unbothered by the eight thousand spirit energy stones. After all, he was a cultivator.
Chapter 1848: Reencountering Yao Qishui

“Yin Tiandao! Assist this guest in opening the stone, ensuring no harm comes to whatever lies within. Be cautious yourself!” Fang Zhengyang instructed Yin Tiandao, newly joined to the Jade Carving Shop.
“Good!” Yin Tiandao’s face lit up with excitement. He had long desired to open the Broken Dragon Stone but lacked both funds and courage—after all, who would risk eight thousand spirit energy stones on a gamble?
Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the stone in anticipation of Yin Tiandao’s efforts.
“Hum…” As Yin Tiandao approached the towering stone, his expression turned solemn.
Opening stones carried risks; no one knew what lay inside, and some had lost their lives in the process.
“This Broken Dragon Stone, as its name suggests, may be broken or a true dragon. For years no one dared touch it—today it shall finally be opened!” The crowd’s faces bore anticipation, waiting for the stone to crack.
“Hum…” A resonant hum echoed as Yin Tiandao brandished a golden short sword, scrutinizing it before slicing at the stone.
“Crack!” A layer of stone peeled away, causing Luo Tian’s eyes to flicker with excitement.
“Roar!” A guttural cry echoed, and an invisible gust of wind blew from the stone, rustling Yin Tiandao’s robes.
“An omen! A strange sound—could it truly hold something valuable?” The crowd murmured in awe.
“Not necessarily. Remember, Master Heo labeled it the Broken Dragon Stone; perhaps it’s all sound and no substance. Until the end, who can say?” The crowd whispered, growing more eager.
“Could Master Heo have erred?” Fang Zhengyang mused quietly, his gaze contemplative.
Master Heo was their shop’s expert in stone appraisal; most stones were assessed by him before being brought to the Jade Carving Shop. Thus, valuable stones were often retained by the shop itself.
Yet not all were kept—business still needed to proceed, and even Heo had made mistakes. Many had discovered treasures in stones, and those who gambled did so with that hope.
“Continue!” Yin Tiandao laughed, flipping his blade and circling the stone with a graceful motion.
“Truly skilled! In the past year, Yin Tiandao has selected and opened stones himself. His skill surpasses many in the Jade Carving Shop!” The crowd marveled as layers of stone peeled away.
Time passed slowly; the stone dwindled to the size of a human head under Yin Tiandao’s relentless strikes.
“Seems there’s nothing valuable here,” the crowd sighed, pitying Luo Tian. Though it was still head-sized, after so long without discovery, it likely held nothing but waste.
“Hum…” As the crowd sighed, waves of energy rose from the head-sized stone. Yin Tiandao’s blade sliced through, and a golden light burst forth, drawing all eyes to the stone.
“Roar!” The cry echoed again, accompanied by a powerful aura.
“Crack! Crack!” The sound of cracking filled the air, and before Yin Tiandao could strike again, the stone cracked open on its own.
“Heart…” A violent gust of wind erupted from the fissures, and the head-sized stone shattered with a thunderous crash.
A whirlwind of wind surged as Fang Zhengyang instantly appeared before Yin Tiandao, pushing his hands forward.
A surge of energy enveloped Fang Zhengyang’s body; his figure was pushed back, and wounds blossomed on his hands and arms.
“Empty…” As the energy settled, everyone stared at the shattered stone fragments. Yet all they saw was dust—nothing else.
“Wasted!” Some pitied, others gloated, their eyes narrowing at Luo Tian’s furrowed brow.
“Regrettable,” Luo Tian muttered, surprised he had misjudged the inscrutable Broken Dragon Stone.
“Friend need not worry; gambling relies on luck!” Fang Zhengyang healed his wounds, reassuring Luo Tian.
“This Broken Dragon Stone has been in my shop for years; few dared touch it. Your courage is rare!” Fang Zhengyang consoled him.
“Ha! I never expected to witness such a spectacle after descending from my peak!” Fang Zhengyang’s words had barely finished when mocking laughter echoed from the crowd, laced with hatred.
“Hmph?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, recognizing the voice.
Others too turned toward the source, unable to ignore such a loud voice.
“Get out of my way!” A domineering voice commanded, inciting anger in the crowd. Yet when they saw who it was, they fell silent, parting to make way.
“Ah, it’s him!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with a smile as a ball-like figure approached.
“Luo Tian, I never expected to see you here!” The ball-shaped figure sneered, walking toward Luo Tian under the crowd’s reverent gaze.
“Yao Qishui, long time no see!” Luo Tian greeted him as if an old acquaintance.
“Heaven has a path you don’t walk, hell has no gate you enter—don’t you know this is my domain? This is the domain of the Chaos Heaven Sect! How dare you appear in Chaos Heaven City?” Yao Qishui sneered.
“Dare to harm me?” Luo Tian shook his head, gazing at Yao Qishui and the accompanying Wang Tiance.
“Dare to harm you? What of it!” Yao Qishui sneered, addressing Wang Tiance.
“Uncle Wang, beat this fool—beat him hard!” Yao Qishui ordered, his voice laced with cruelty.
“Yes!” Wang Tiance smirked, eyeing Luo Tian’s calm smile before stepping forward.
“Fool! You let me escape before—now there’s no Qiu Ming to save you. This is Chaos Heaven City!” Wang Tiance bellowed, his aura rising.
“Old fool, fight or talk—what’s the point of words? I’m not the same as before. Do you think I’m still at your mercy?” Luo Tian’s aura surged, stepping toward Wang Tiance.
“Hum…” An invisible wave formed between Luo Tian and Wang Tiance, with faint collisions echoing in the crowd’s ears.
“Who is this youth who dares challenge Wang Tiance?” The crowd marveled, gazing at Luo Tian.
“Luo Tian—such a familiar name!” They murmured.
“Isn’t there a famous disciple named Luo Tian in the Heaven Dragon Sect? Could it be him?” They speculated.
“Certainly! Otherwise, who else would dare challenge Yao Qishui in Chaos Heaven City?” They quickly concluded the wastrel was Luo Tian of the Heaven Dragon Sect.
“Disrupting order in the Jade Carving Shop—death!” Fang Zhengyang snorted, stepping between Luo Tian and Wang Tiance. The tension dissolved.
“Hmph?” Fang Zhengyang turned, gazing at Luo Tian with a hint of caution before looking at Wang Tiance.
“Fang Zhengyang, do you dare interfere in my sect’s affairs? Let me have this youth!” Wang Tiance addressed Fang Zhengyang.
Wang Tiance didn’t know the Jade Carving Shop’s origins, but in all of Chaos Heaven City, it was the only force beyond the Chaos Heaven Sect’s reach.
“Chaos Heaven City—Jade Carving Shop is untouchable!” Wang Tiance recalled the sect’s orders.
In recent years, the Jade Carving Shop and Chaos Heaven Sect had maintained a truce; Wang Tiance assumed it was a friend of the sect’s leader.
Now, he sought to capture Luo Tian; the Jade Carving Shop would surely grant him this favor. After all, he was a senior elder of Chaos Heaven Sect, and Yao Qishui’s grandfather was a revered elder within the sect.
“Get out of my shop and demand respect? What are you, anyway? Even if it were the sect’s leader, they couldn’t break our master’s rules!” Fang Zhengyang sneered, shouting at Wang Tiance without regard.
“Fang Zhengyang, you…”
“You truly think I fear you? You’re just a steward! How dare you speak to me, a senior elder of Chaos Heaven Sect!” Wang Tiance reddened, stunned Fang Zhengyang’s audacity.
“You dare test me? I’ve already warned you, but if you cause trouble, I’ll kill you!” Fang Zhengyang’s voice turned icy as he awaited Wang Tiance’s move.
“I’ll see if you can harm me!” Wang Tiance, enraged, bypassed Fang Zhengyang and lunged at Luo Tian.
Chapter 1849: The Assertive Fang Zhengyang

Wang Tiance roared, transforming into a golden dragon, his aura overwhelming as he charged at Luo Tian. His golden hand struck like a dragon, crashing toward Luo Tian.
“Idiot!” Luo Tian didn’t move, arms crossed, ignoring Wang Tiance’s attack. His gaze was on Fang Zhengyang.
“Die!” Fang Zhengyang, seeing Wang Tiance ignore his warning and attack Luo Tian, glared with murderous intent. His steps left trails as he vanished before Wang Tiance, his late-stage Celestial Immortal aura exploding. He struck Wang Tiance’s back with a palm.
“Roar!” The golden dragon illusion shattered, and Wang Tiance’s body was slammed into the ground, dust flying as he landed in a deep pit, coughing blood.
“Gasps…” The crowd murmured in astonishment—Fang Zhengyang had truly attacked Wang Tiance, acting swiftly as he claimed. He clearly held no regard for Chaos Heaven Sect.
“I warned you; it’s your own fault!” Fang Zhengyang’s face was cold as he grabbed the golden blade Yin Tiandao had used to open the stone, weighing it before tossing it at Wang Tiance.
“Hum…” The golden blade flashed, its cold light slicing toward Wang Tiance in the pit.
“Dare to kill!” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, more curious about the Jade Carving Shop’s mysterious master. A steward dared kill a Heaven Dragon Sect elder!
Others too were stunned—Fang Zhengyang truly intended to slay Wang Tiance.
“Hmph?” Yet as the golden blade neared Wang Tiance’s back, a voice echoed in Fang Zhengyang’s mind, causing his expression to shift. He grabbed the blade, returning it to his hand.
“My master says, out of respect for Chaos Heaven Sect’s leader, I’ll spare your life. If you cause more trouble, no mercy!” Fang Zhengyang sneered, saying nothing else. He glanced at Luo Tian before leading Yin Tiandao into the shop’s depths.
“Cough… cough…” Wang Tiance, pale-faced, rose from the pit, his eyes filled with fear. He felt Fang Zhengyang had truly intended to kill him.
Yet Wang Tiance’s heart seethed with hatred, his gaze fixed on Fang Zhengyang’s departure. He vowed to avenge this humiliation.
“Crack…” Luo Tian approached the stone he had bought, his face puzzled—clearly, that inscrutable aura still lingered.
“Luo Tian, today you’re lucky. Don’t step out of the Jade Carving Shop!” Yao Qishui’s eyes burned with madness, watching Luo Tian dance before him yet powerless to act.
Luo Tian ignored Yao Qishui’s threats, focusing instead on examining the debris.
“Unwilling?” The crowd murmured, watching this youth who had briefly stirred the lower three realms.
“Could he be unwilling? That’s eight thousand spirit energy stones—enough to buy a fine city! Even a Heaven Dragon Sect elder would hesitate!” The crowd sneered at Luo Tian, accustomed to his antics.
“Luo Tian, are you trying to recoup your losses?” Yao Qishui’s eyes gleamed as he addressed Luo Tian, knowing he’d accept. Gamblers always sought to recover their losses.
“Crack…” Yet Luo Tian ignored Yao Qishui, continuing to examine the debris.
“Hmph!” Yao Qishui was momentarily stunned, surprised he had been ignored.
“Dare to gamble with me?” Yao Qishui persisted, his gaze on Luo Tian.
“Ah? How?” Hearing Yao Qishui’s words, Luo Tian paused his actions, curiosity in his eyes.
“Surely he’s hooked!” Yao Qishui smiled, having Wang Tiance rest as he approached Luo Tian.
“Gambling is simple: we each buy a stone, open it immediately. Whose contents are more valuable, the loser must give the winner items of equivalent value!” Yao Qishui boasted, his belly swaying as he spoke.
“Good!” Luo Tian smiled faintly, nodding. He understood Yao Qishui’s intent.
“But I have a condition: the loser must call the winner grandpa three times and kneel three times!” Yao Qishui added after Luo Tian’s agreement.
“This Luo Tian is seeking punishment! Yao Qishui, though a wastrel, has his own wealth. Gambling is his specialty!” The crowd sighed.
Luo Tian’s earlier expenditure of eight thousand spirit energy stones had shown he was a novice, clueless about stone appraisal.
“Fine, if you insist on calling me grandpa, I have no choice,” Luo Tian shook his head.
“To avoid mishaps, each of us selects three stones!” Yao Qishui, sensing Luo Tian’s confidence, felt an inexplicable unease.
“Whatever!” Luo Tian nodded, continuing to fiddle with the debris.
“Kid, let you gloat a bit—wait till I make you cry!” Yao Qishui sneered, watching Luo Tian’s demeanor.
Yao Qishui hadn’t planned to kill Luo Tian in the Jade Carving Shop; after all, Luo Tian was a Heaven Dragon Sect disciple with remarkable talent. If he died, the sect would surely investigate.
Sneering, Yao Qishui swayed his belly toward the shop’s depths to select stones.
“Yuyan, go for a walk—spend two thousand spirit energy stones freely. Pick any stone you like!” Luo Tian smiled, handing Long Yuyan a storage bag.
“Two thousand…” The crowd shook their heads at the number, though two thousand spirit energy stones were considerable here, dwarfed by Yao Qishui’s wealth.
“Luo Tian brother…” Long Yuyan was hesitant, not wanting Luo Tian to lose.
“Don’t worry; I trust you!” Luo Tian smiled, then returned to fiddling with the debris.
“Fine!” Long Yuyan carefully stored the bag, beginning to select stones in the shop.
“Mad! This Luo Tian is mad!” The crowd shook their heads, watching him fiddle with debris.
Time passed slowly; half an hour elapsed without Luo Tian moving, his focus on the debris. His purple eyes glowed faintly with bloodshot veins.
“Here, here! Be careful—do you think you can afford to break it?” As the crowd grew impatient, Yao Qishui’s voice echoed, directing workers into the crowd.
Six workers carried three stones, entering the group—one towering, two half-human in height. They placed them down.
“Hiss…” The crowd gasped at the sight of six stones.
“That’s also a Broken Dragon Stone! Those two are worth over five thousand spirit energy stones!” The crowd marveled, staring at the three stones—prices alone exceeded twenty thousand.
“This must be the shop’s finest stones!” The crowd whispered, comparing Luo Tian’s two thousand spirit energy stones to Yao Qishui’s lavish investment.
“Haha!” Yao Qishui smiled triumphantly. He hadn’t possessed so many spirit energy stones before; this mission had required him to buy two stones for his grandfather, hence the abundance.
“These are the shop’s legendary stones—surely they’ll yield treasures!” The crowd recognized the two half-human stones, whispering.
“Luo Tian brother…” As the crowd murmured, Long Yuyan emerged from the group, workers carrying three stones in.
Three stones, each human-sized, bore intricate patterns with spiritual energy radiating from them, enveloping the stones in an aura of value.
“Alas…” The crowd sighed, their disappointment evident—though the stones looked good, they paled in comparison to Yao Qishui’s.
“Ha! Luo Tian, you go first or me?” Yao Qishui laughed, addressing Luo Tian.
“You go first!” Luo Tian’s expression remained calm as he observed Yao Qishui’s three stones, his eyes gleaming.
“Good!” Yao Qishui nodded, taking a golden blade from the workers and approaching the Broken Dragon Stone. He swung his plump arms, beginning to open it.
“Crack! Crack!” Stone peels fell away, waves of energy emanating from the stone.
“Roar!” As Yao Qishui hacked, golden light burst forth repeatedly.
“Crack!” Finally, under the crowd’s anticipation, the stone peels cracked open, a burst of explosive spiritual energy spreading outward.
Chapter 1850: Dragon Eye Crystal

“Hmph!” Yao Qishui sneered, launching a talisman from his hand that formed a barrier around him.
“Hum…” The blade cut through the barrier, swirling for a while before ceasing.
“Open!” Yao Qishui roared, exiting the barrier and slicing the remaining head-sized stone.
“Crack!” The stone shattered, light scattering as a dragon-shaped illusion surged upward, roaring before dissipating.
“Is there anything? Will it be like Luo Tian’s—nothing at all?” All hearts brimmed with anticipation, waiting for the golden light to fade.
As everyone watched, the blinding golden light faded, revealing a fist-sized fragment.
“There’s something!” The crowd gasped, eyes fixated on the fragment, their excitement palpable.
The Broken Dragon Stone never failed to yield treasures, so they were elated.
“It’s a Dragon Scale Crystal!” They immediately identified the fragment, erupting in chatter.
Dragon Scale Crystals resembled dragon scales, part of a spiritual vein, their spiritual energy surpassing that of Spirit Crystals.
“Ha! A Dragon Scale Crystal—this alone would crush you! This crystal is conservatively worth forty thousand spirit energy stones!” Yao Qishui laughed, elated. A single Dragon Scale Crystal would let him recoup his losses.
“My luck is extraordinary!” Yao Qishui thought, recalling he had opened Broken Dragon Stones before but yielded nothing—this time, a Dragon Scale Crystal would please his grandfather, who was on the verge of a breakthrough. With this crystal and treasures from the other two legendary stones, success was assured.
“Truly remarkable!” The crowd’s faces bore envy—Dragon Scale Crystals were priceless; auctioning them would fetch astronomical prices, often tripling Yao Qishui’s estimate.
“You continue!” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, calming Long Yuyan before resuming his debris search. After hours of sifting, only a small portion remained.
“You continue!” Yao Qishui, seeing Luo Tian’s demeanor, grew angry, slicing another half-human-sized, purple-tinged legendary stone.
Stone peels fell away, waves of violet energy radiating outward, drawing the crowd’s anticipation.
“Never expected to witness such a spectacle—two Broken Dragon Stones, two legendary stones opened on the same day!” The crowd whispered, awaiting the legendary stone’s opening.
“Crack!” Purple light flickered, revealing a fist-sized object resembling purple crystal.
“It’s a Purple Crystal! Indeed a legendary stone—Purple Crystals have appeared!” Another round of gasps erupted as they gazed at the crystal Yao Qishui held.
“This one’s base price is thirty thousand!” Yao Qishui was overjoyed; this Purple Crystal was also rare, though less valuable than the Dragon Scale Crystal.
“Indeed, you’ve outdone yourself. Continue—there’s still one left!” Luo Tian urged Yao Qishui, picking up a palm-sized fragment from the Broken Dragon Stone.
“Hope you don’t disappoint me!” Luo Tian smiled, weighing the seemingly ordinary fragment before Yao Qishui sliced the final legendary stone.
“Hum…” Spiritual energy surrounded it, and golden light flashed—revealing a head-sized Spirit Crystal.
“Such a large Spirit Crystal could be worth twenty thousand at minimum!” Yao Qishui gazed at Luo Tian.
A Dragon Scale Crystal, a Purple Crystal, and a head-sized Spirit Crystal lay before them, their spiritual energy enveloping the shop. All faces bore envy and greed.
“These three items—none could afford them. In the lower three realms, no more than ten sects could buy them!” One murmured.
“Totaling ninety-five thousand spirit energy stones—this is my conservative estimate. Everyone here understands, I’ve priced it fairly!” Yao Qishui boasted, gazing at Luo Tian with pride.
“Indeed, no exaggeration—its value is accurate and not underestimated!” The crowd murmured. Luo Tian heard it, his smile undimmed.
“You still gloat? Let’s see what you can open! And what will you give me for these spirit energy stones? Write a promissory note—when I come to collect, I’ll go to the Heaven Dragon Sect!” Yao Qishui barked at Luo Tian.
“Open it!” Luo Tian sighed, taking the golden blade from the workers and approaching the three stones Long Yuyan had selected.
“Self-inflicted humiliation!” The crowd shook their heads—Yao Qishui’s three treasures were beyond what Long Yuyan’s stones could yield.
“Crack! Crack!” Stone peels fell away, the stone transforming into debris before their eyes. A crystalline object dropped.
“Ha! Is this a spirit energy stone?” The crowd erupted in laughter, picking up the Spirit Stone.
“Luo Tian brother…” Long Yuyan’s face flushed red, her head nearly buried in shame.
“Nothing to worry about!” Luo Tian smiled, moving to the second stone, slicing it again.
“Hum…” This time was different—spirit energy surged upward, mist swirling as several fingernail-sized Spirit Crystals appeared.
“Hmph! Truly opened Spirit Crystals—though they’re too modest, worth only a few thousand!” The crowd whispered, no longer expecting much from Luo Tian.
“Ha! You’re still gullible—let me take a little less, but your sister could cover ten thousand!” Yao Qishui laughed.
“Hum…” Yet a cold aura swept over Yao Qishui, Luo Tian’s eyes burning with murder. Yao Qishui shivered.
“Open your dog eyes and watch!” Luo Tian coldly ordered, revealing the fragment he had sifted through.
“Ha! Is this your third stone?” Yao Qishui paused, then laughed heartily.
“Mad! A worthless fragment—did you give up?” The crowd sneered.
“Certainly gave up! After Yao Qishui opened three treasures, even if you opened a Dragon Scale Crystal, you’d still lose!” The crowd whispered.
“Hum…” As the crowd murmured, Luo Tian wielded his golden blade, slicing the fragment.
“Roar!” The stone shattered with a deafening roar, and a dragon’s aura surged.
“Too blinding!” Everyone closed their eyes instantly, astonishment on their faces.
“Hum…” A surge of spiritual energy spread outward, shaking the crowd as they opened their eyes. The shop fell silent.
A golden dragon coiled in the sky, its eyes sharp, its body radiating overwhelming pressure.
“My heavens! Truly something—could it be a real dragon?” The crowd gasped, watching the coiling dragon.
“This… this…” Yao Qishui was stunned, witnessing such a scene for the first time. It exceeded his comprehension.
“Gada…” The golden dragon dissolved, two Dragon Eye Crystals falling into Luo Tian’s hands.
Two lifelike Dragon Eye Crystals glowed with fierce spiritual energy, causing Luo Tian to smile.
“It’s a Dragon Eye Crystal—this is the core of a spiritual vein!” Someone gasped, identifying the two eyes.
“My heavens! Dragon Eye Crystals—this item is beyond price! If perfected, it could forge a spiritual vein!” The crowd’s eyes burned with desire, gazing at the Dragon Eye Crystals.
“Hum…” Two invisible whirlpools emerged from the two crystals, emitting suction.
As the suction spread, all exposed spirit energy stones in the shop trembled, shattering as their spiritual energy surged toward Luo Tian’s Dragon Eye Crystals. This included the three stones beside Yao Qishui, brimming with spiritual energy.
“Crack!” Shattering sounds echoed at Yao Qishui’s side, the three crystalline stones turning to dust on the ground.
“This…” Yao Qishui was stunned, staring at the dust, speechless.
“Indeed, I wasn’t disappointed!” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the Dragon Eye Crystals. After absorbing spiritual energy, they appeared even more vivid.
“Apologies, how much are these worth in spirit energy stones?” Luo Tian smiled again, addressing Yao Qishui.
“At least two hundred thousand!” Luo Tian said, “I’ve reclaimed part of the bet. Do you intend to fulfill the other half?” He stored the Dragon Eye Crystals, watching Yao Qishui with amusement.
Chapter 1851: A Bloody Killing Path

“Finished…” Yao Qishui collapsed to the ground, his legs weak, like a pile of mud. He stared at the dust.
Wang Tiance’s face bore despair; these stones were what Yao Qishui’s grandfather had ordered. Now, with this mistake, he too would suffer. Yao Qishui’s grandfather’s wrath was beyond his endurance—death or not, he’d lose a layer of skin.
“Come on, call me grandpa three times!” Luo Tian approached Yao Qishui, his gaze playful.
“Fate has turned—never expected to witness Dragon Eye Crystals, such an absurd item!” The crowd marveled. They had thought Luo Tian would lose, but he’d turned the tide.
“Call me grandpa or not?” Luo Tian gazed at Yao Qishui, who was sweating profusely, looking like a shrunken figure.
“Go away! Don’t call me grandpa—I don’t have such a grandson!” Luo Tian sneered, addressing Yao Qishui’s trembling form. He knew Yao Qishui would face no good fate upon returning to Chaos Heaven Mountain.
“Haha, the youth’s integrity is absurd! He truly unearthed an absurd treasure from a worthless stone!” Fang Zhengyang smiled, rejoining the crowd.
“Don’t know—do you wish to sell this Dragon Eye Crystal? Price is your call!” Fang Zhengyang spoke directly, revealing his intent.
In fact, Fang Zhengyang had sensed the Dragon Scale Crystal and Purple Crystal when Yao Qishui opened them. But due to prior matters, he hadn’t intervened.
