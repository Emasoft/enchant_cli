“Come out!” Qiu Taiping growled, attempting to retrieve his soul and deciding temporarily not to refine the Soul-Subduing Cauldron.

But soon, Qiu Taiping's mind trembled violently; an immense attraction pulled his soul back forcibly, as if a strange pulling force was siphoning it.

“No!” Qiu Taiping widened his eyes, a look of disbelief etched on his face. This sudden occurrence left him unable to accept it. He could imagine that continuing like this would result in his soul disintegrating—unless he fully refined the Soul-Subduing Cauldron.

Qiu Taiping was unwilling, unwilling to let his newly revived body—strong enough to reach the pinnacle—die like this.

“Damn it, could this be a celestial-grade treasure? If I were at my peak, what would you even be?” Qiu Taiping cursed inwardly, regretting his arrogance and underestimating the Soul-Subduing Cauldron.

“No, I can’t let this continue!” Qiu Taiping growled mentally, his eyes flashing a ruthless glint.

“I need to think of something!” Qiu Taiping muttered, and within that brief moment, his soul energy had already diminished by a full tenth.

Chapter 416: Zheng Bowen's Crisis

The loss of soul energy made Qiu Taiping’s face pale. He grabbed the Soul-Subduing Cauldron, casting a glance at Feng Tingshu. At this moment, he had no energy to care about Feng Tingshu, mentally calculating that after resolving the current problem, he would collect it.

He placed the Soul-Subduing Cauldron into his storage ring, but its immense suction still devoured Qiu Taiping’s soul. It was like an endless abyss.

“I need soul energy!” Qiu Taiping roared, controlling Luo Tian’s body to dart like a leopard beneath Feng Tingshu, rushing toward the outer edge of Windstorm Valley.

Outside Windstorm Valley, Zheng Bowen wore a look of anxiety, appearing at the sole exit. A leaf from Feng Tingshu concealed his aura perfectly, and he dashed forward.

When Zheng Bowen reached the valley’s entrance, his body halted abruptly—several figures stood before him, prompting a look of solemnity on Zheng Bowen’s face.

“Bu Yuhan, I should have known it was you!” Zheng Bowen’s eyes flashed a ruthless glint.

In front of him stood Bu Yuhan, who had once reached nine thousand zhang in the stone tablet during their initial recruitment, overpowering Duan Xingchen and Leng Qiuchan. Now he sat on the ground, while several others were the youths who had previously ambushed Zheng Bowen.

Bu Yuhan was no stranger to Zheng Bowen; upon entering Windstorm Valley, his name had spread rapidly. His formidable talent and cultivation secured him a place within the valley, even earning him the status of a direct disciple under Windstorm Valley’s Grand Elder.

“I can’t fight directly—quickly send a message to the outside!” Zheng Bowen carefully maneuvered, his body moving like wind toward the group.

But as Zheng Bowen’s figure glided past them, Bu Yuhan—seated on the ground—suddenly opened his eyes, a playful smile curling his lips. A cold voice echoed in Zheng Bowen’s mind: “Zheng Senior, I’ve been waiting for you again!”

“Exposed!” Zheng Bowen had no time to ponder why he was discovered. A replica of the Flying Cloud Hammer materialized in his hand.

“Hah, Zheng Senior, you’re not my match! Surrender!” Bu Yuhan sneered.

“Then let’s see who wins!” Zheng Bowen’s eyes darkened, his twin hammers swinging fiercely toward Bu Yuhan.

“KILL!” Bu Yuhan’s eyes burned with killing intent, and the surrounding youths rushed forward like wind, their martial arts and thunderous clashes echoing through the battlefield.

“Aha, that must be his companion!” A soft whisper echoed from the void, and a figure gradually appeared dozens of zhang away. His gaze flickered slightly.

…

As the battle raged, Qiu Taiping—occupying Luo Tian’s body—raced through Windstorm Valley and the void fissures, his body radiating swirling spiritual energy like an arrow.

“Damn it, what is this treasure? Sixty percent of my soul energy!” Qiu Taiping’s eyes burned with madness. In a short time, his soul energy had been consumed by sixty percent, damaging his core essence.

“Almost there—I can sense someone’s presence!” Qiu Taiping roared, his speed surging again like a meteor toward Zheng Bowen’s battlefield.

“Zheng Bowen, don’t resist—just die quietly! Don’t worry, your brother and younger sibling will join you in the afterlife soon!” Bu Yuhan’s sword pierced Zheng Bowen’s chest.

“Pfth!” Zheng Bowen blocked Bu Yuhan’s blade with a hammer, but his back was struck by a punch from the leader of the ambushers.

“Pound!” A thunderous sound echoed as Zheng Bowen spat blood, his face instantly pale.

“Hmph!” Bu Yuhan seized the opportunity, his sword swirling like a dragon toward Zheng Bowen.

After being surrounded and attacked earlier, Zheng Bowen was at his weakest. Seeing Bu Yuhan’s sword, he flashed a ruthless glint. A drop of blood floated before him, which he absorbed into his body, transforming into a surge of cultivation. His body expanded, narrowly dodging Bu Yuhan’s attack.

Seeing Zheng Bowen burn his blood, Bu Yuhan showed no regret but instead a joyous expression.

“I’ll see how much blood you have left to burn!” His sword hummed again, charging toward Zheng Bowen. Others also moved in, surrounding him.

“Not enough!” Zheng Bowen’s face darkened as if water would drip from it, another two drops of blood appearing before him. He absorbed them into his body, his face turning a sickly red.

“Roar!” After absorbing three drops of blood, Zheng Bowen transformed into a war god, roaring as he clashed with Bu Yuhan and the others.

“Three drops of blood—still no use!” Bu Yuhan sheathed his sword, extending a white, jade-like finger. A smile graced his face, but golden spiritual energy surged toward it, gathering into a terrifying pressure.

Others stood still, leaving one to engage Zheng Bowen while the rest swiftly formed seals.

“Cangmang Fist!”
“Fierce Sun Scorching Heaven!” Their martial arts erupted, converging toward Zheng Bowen.

The thunderous explosion shattered Zheng Bowen’s hammer, forming a hammer-shaped illusion that dispersed the attacks.

“Last gasp!” The others gaped in shock, but Bu Yuhan merely smiled.

“Heaven-Striking Finger!” A colossal finger illusion formed in the sky, crushing toward Zheng Bowen with terrifying pressure.

“Dead!” Zheng Bowen’s face showed weakness as he gazed at the approaching finger. The previous attack had drained his spiritual energy, and now he didn’t know how to counter Bu Yuhan’s technique.

In an instant, two dark lights shot toward Bu Yuhan, who wore a triumphant expression. A spiritual energy wave appeared before Zheng Bowen, pulling him out of the Heaven-Striking Finger’s range.

“Boom!” The Heaven-Striking Finger smashed into the ground Zheng Bowen had just occupied, emitting a deafening roar.

“Dead!” Bu Yuhan’s companions looked at him with reverence, unaware of the scene. They believed Bu Yuhan’s Heaven-Striking Finger had crushed Zheng Bowen.

It was the fourth watch, and I send this chapter with gratitude to an anonymous reader on the main site who donated.

Chapter 417: Absorption

“This is a grade-land martial art!” Bu Yuhan’s companions gazed at the deep pit crushed by Heaven-Striking Finger, admiration in their eyes.

“Senior Bu is mighty!” Someone shouted.

All eyes turned to Bu Yuhan, but then they inhaled sharply—Bu Yuhan’s gaze was dark, and two black swords were embedded before him.

“Who!” Bu Yuhan roared, ignoring others’ gazes and staring into the void.

“Today I’m not in the mood to kill you—goodbye!” A cold voice echoed from the void, growing fainter.

“Buzz…” The two black swords hummed, flying away toward the distance.

“Don’t run! Chase them!” Bu Yuhan’s eyes darkened, his gaze almost weeping as he ordered the others.

They had now fully understood Zheng Bowen was alive, rescued by someone. They dared not delay and rushed toward the black swords.

But as they prepared to move, a terrifying pressure instantly invaded their bodies, rendering them motionless. Even Bu Yuhan’s body trembled slightly, halting his movement.

“Senior!” The leader of the ambushers, Jinge, looked terrified, gazing at a figure dashing toward them. This was Qiu Taiping, who had possessed Luo Tian’s body.

“Someone is here!” Qiu Taiping’s face showed madness, his pale complexion like a sheet of paper as he appeared before Bu Yuhan and the others.

“Eighty percent of my soul energy…” Qiu Taiping’s soul energy had been siphoned nearly eighty percent during his run.

“Die…” Luo Tian’s figure instantly appeared before them, a fist slamming into one of Bu Yuhan’s companions.

This punch contained annihilating power. Qiu Taiping, a former great sage, had mastered both water and wood attributes. This annihilating punch was executed to perfection.

Gray energy enveloped the youth, and in people’s stunned gazes, he aged rapidly, his body withering like a corpse long dead.

“Come here!” A powerful suction emanated from Luo Tian’s hands, drawing the youth toward him.

A wisp of gray gas escaped the youth’s body, resembling his form. Others could even see the youth’s desperate gaze before death.

The gray gas instantly reached Luo Tian, who opened his mouth to absorb it. This wisp replenished Luo Tian’s complexion somewhat.

“A soul of Bone-Consuming Mid-stage—can restore half my soul energy. Good, absorbing you will help me recover!” Luo Tian licked his crimson lips, a cruel smile on his face as he gazed at the remaining others.

He闪动, instantly appearing before another Bone-Consuming Mid-stage youth, reaching out to grab him.

The youth was still stunned by Luo Tian’s previous kill, and before he could react, he was lifted into Luo Tian’s grasp.

Feeling Luo Tian’s powerful aura and recalling his mysterious method, the youth trembled, his body weakening.

“Crack!” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate, twisting the youth’s neck with force. He opened his mouth, and the youth’s soul was sucked into Luo Tian’s mouth.

Seeing Luo Tian easily eliminate two, Bu Yuhan’s companions stared with terror, fear rising in their hearts.

Bu Yuhan’s face turned solemn as he gazed at Luo Tian. During the initial recruitment, he had seen Luo Tian. He didn’t know why, but a desire to kill Luo Tian surged within him.

“Who are you?” Bu Yuhan asked softly.

Hearing Bu Yuhan’s question, Luo Tian absorbed another youth’s soul, his face showing satisfaction. His soul had recovered to forty percent, though the Soul-Subduing Cauldron still siphoned it. But with these souls, he felt much better.

He gazed at Bu Yuhan, and the two locked eyes. Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with wild joy: “I didn’t expect to meet a soul reborn from remnants!”

Bu Yuhan, upon locking eyes with Luo Tian, felt his mind quake. He now understood why this Luo Tian differed so drastically in temperament from the one he had seen before. Moreover, Luo Tian revealed his greatest secret—his soul was a remnant that had reborn through possession.

“Your soul must be very powerful, right? Let me supplement myself! After fusing your soul, this cursed thing should be fully refined!” Luo Tian showed no concern for Bu Yuhan’s strength, gazing at him like a prey.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Bu Yuhan’s face darkened with anger. Both were soul possessors; now he was treated like prey, which Bu Yuhan couldn’t endure.

As Bu Yuhan’s face darkened, Luo Tian had already killed one of his companions and absorbed its soul.

This youth’s death left only Bu Yuhan and Jinge alive, while the four others were instantly killed by Luo Tian.

“Now it’s your turn! My supplement!” Luo Tian smiled playfully, gazing at Bu Yuhan and Jinge.

Jinge fell to his knees immediately, his mind now fully convinced that Luo Tian was a supreme sage. He bowed repeatedly to the ground, terrified by Luo Tian’s strange method.

“Respectful elder, mercy! Do you remember me? We met before!” Jinge, a Bone-Consuming Late-stage powerhouse with strength surpassing ordinary stone, his forehead cracked repeatedly.

Luo Tian smiled: “Temporarily spare your life, but don’t follow this fool again. Follow me instead!”

“Yes! Yes! I’m willing to serve you as a servant!” Jinge, hearing Luo Tian’s words, was overjoyed. He forgot Bu Yuhan entirely, even if he saw Bu Yuhan’s dark gaze. Jinge would unhesitatingly agree, for Luo Tian was an immortal-level being in his eyes.

“Stay aside and wait while I deal with this fool! Don’t think of fleeing—don’t waste your chance to live!” Luo Tian clenched his fist, looking down on Bu Yuhan.

Chapter 418: Bu Yuhan’s True Form

Hearing Luo Tian’s unhidden mockery, Bu Yuhan’s face turned fierce. He instantly appeared before Jinge, striking his head with a palm.

“Crack!” Like a watermelon shattering, Jinge’s head turned into blood mist.

Seeing Bu Yuhan kill Jinge, Luo Tian showed no reaction. Instead, he extended his hand to absorb Jinge’s soul into his palm.

“Don’t worry, I’ll avenge your death! But your soul can’t be wasted. Bone-Consuming Late-stage should restore one-tenth of my soul!” Luo Tian spoke, opening his mouth to suck in Jinge’s soul.

Absorbing five Bone-Consuming realm souls, Qiu Taiping’s soul recovered to fifty percent. However, the Soul-Subduing Cauldron siphoned half of it.

“Now, reveal your name so I can check if I’ve met you before. If I have, I might spare your life!” Luo Tian gazed at Bu Yuhan standing there with a cold expression.

“Bu Jingtian!” Bu Yuhan’s face was calm, his aura suddenly shifting. A terrifying presence radiated from him.

“Oh, I’ve never heard of you. Surrender your nine-tenths of soul and follow me—I’ll consider sparing your life!” Luo Tian stretched his body, as if trying to fully merge with this body.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Bu Jingtian’s face turned fierce. To surrender to someone? He couldn’t do it. His lips curled into a smile: “I can sense your soul is diminishing. Are you sure you’re my match now?”

“Foolishness! Have you heard of Qiu Taiping’s name?” Luo Tian’s face showed arrogance.

Hearing Qiu Taiping mention his name, Bu Jingtian’s face shook in shock. His eyes widened with disbelief at Luo Tian.

“Tun Tian Demon Emperor Qiu Taiping!” Bu Jingtian whispered, his gaze more cautious.

Tun Tian Demon Emperor Qiu Taiping, a peak soul cultivator from ten thousand years ago. At that time, Bu Jingtian was merely a lowly immortal-level cultivator. Qiu Taiping’s name had already spread across the Tianyuan Continent, even rivaling several sects’ elders.

“Haha, it seems someone still remembers me!” Luo Tian’s face showed nostalgia.

“Didn’t the elders of several sects kill you?” Bu Jingtian’s eyes showed surprise, unable to help asking.

“Killed? Just those old bastards wanted to kill me? They only severed my physical body! My soul wasn’t destroyed!” Qiu Taiping sighed, his body radiating a powerful confidence. His eyes burned with hatred toward Windstorm Valley.

“But it was worth it. With this body, I believe I can reach the legendary界尊境 (Realm-Transcending Stage). How about you give me three breaths to decide—submit and surrender your nine-tenths of soul!” Qiu Taiping’s eyes smiled.

Hearing Qiu Taiping’s words, Bu Jingtian’s face showed a moment of struggle. His highest cultivation was only Bone-Consuming Early-stage, and in Qiu Taiping’s eyes, he had been just a little kid. The conditions were harsh, but they matched their former positions.

“One breath…” As Bu Jingtian thought, Qiu Taiping’s cold voice echoed from Luo Tian:

“He hasn’t fully merged with this body yet. His soul energy is still dissipating. This gives me a chance. If I seize this body named Luo Tian, I can also reach the peak!” Bu Jingtian’s eyes glowed with greed as he gazed at Luo Tian. The Five Elements Body was too tempting for these ancient monsters.

Three breaths passed in an instant. Qiu Taiping saw Bu Jingtian thinking and his face turned cold, instantly moving.

“Heaven-Striking Finger!” After careful calculation, Bu Jingtian’s face showed a fierce glint. He immediately unleashed Heaven-Striking Finger.

“Fleeting insect against a tree!” Qiu Taiping smiled, his hands moving swiftly. Two great seals appeared in the sky.

The Imperial Seal! Luo Tian’s strongest martial art, now fully fused under Qiu Taiping’s control. The terrifying pressure instantly dispersed Heaven-Striking Finger’s pressure.

A massive “Imperial” seal slowly formed in the sky. Seeing this, Bu Jingtian’s face showed shock: “Martial art fusion!”

Not only Bu Jingtian was shocked, but Qiu Taiping himself also showed surprise. Both were ancient monsters who knew how difficult it was to fuse martial arts.

“This kid’s talent is unmatched. If he were alive, I wouldn’t mind finding him a good body and taking him as my disciple!” Qiu Taiping, after seeing the Imperial Seal, sighed.

“Boom…” Heaven-Striking Finger and the Imperial Seal clashed violently, emitting thunderous sounds as if tearing apart the entire sky.

The Imperial Seal instantly shattered Heaven-Striking Finger, crushing toward Bu Jingtian.

“Crash…” The golden seal smashed down.

But Bu Jingtian wasn’t a simple opponent. Golden light surged beneath his feet, and he vanished from the spot without caring about the Imperial Seal’s pressure.

“Annihilation of Life!” As Bu Jingtian steadied himself, he heard Qiu Taiping’s cold voice.

A powerful wood-element energy surged toward him, making Bu Jingtian’s face change. If it were his prime, he wouldn’t fear this life-annihilation force. But now, his body and cultivation were far weaker than before.

“Sky-Soaring Heaven’s Scripture!” He activated his technique, beginning to resist the life-annihilation force.

As Bu Jingtian resisted the loss of vitality, a seven-colored fist rushed toward him, smashing into Bu Jingtian.

Bu Jingtian, experienced as he was, resisted both the life-annihilation force and Qiu Taiping’s attack. Though it was chaotic, he wasn’t in immediate danger.

“Still resisting? Your body isn’t as strong as mine. Even though I’ve lost some soul energy, you’re still weaker than me. Experience—ah, you still lack it! I’ll see what you have to resist my attacks!” Qiu Taiping controlled Luo Tian’s body, throwing punch after punch. Each strike grew stronger, and his soul was rapidly merging with Luo Tian’s body.

Chapter 419: Absorption

While Qiu Taiping controlled Luo Tian’s body to fight Bu Jingtian, within Luo Tian’s mind-sea, a tiny light floated above the golden mind-sea.

This light was minuscule, so small that even Qiu Taiping hadn’t noticed its presence. If magnified a hundred thousand times, one could see it was a golden book.

Luo Tian’s soul had been absorbed into the纪元之书 (Chronicle of Epochs), leaving him in a haze. He had suffered heavy damage, his soul weakened to the extreme. Now, Luo Tian’s soul drifted in a gray space.

Drifting aimlessly, he seemed to have forgotten who he was or how he arrived here—like a soulless remnant wandering aimlessly.

After drifting for an unknown time, Luo Tian’s soul was drawn by something, moving toward a distant platform.

Finally, Luo Tian’s soul found another remnant drifting similarly. This remnant emitted a faint wave but carried an aura of longing toward Luo Tian.

“Devour it!” Luo Tian didn’t know why, but a strong desire surged through him. It felt as if devouring this remnant would make him stronger, help him regain his identity.

Before Luo Tian attacked, the remnant rushed toward him with hostility.

“Devour…” Luo Tian’s soul instantly bit into the opponent.

Luo Tian’s soul was stronger than this remnant, and despite being his first battle, he completely devoured the remnant.

After devouring it, Luo Tian’s soul seemed to grow larger. Yet he remained unaware and continued drifting forward.

Not long after, Luo Tian’s soul encountered another remnant of similar size. After the intense battle, his soul grew larger and drifted toward the distant platform.

As Luo Tian drifted, more remnants appeared, his soul growing larger and denser.

Eventually, Luo Tian’s soul transformed into a human-like shape with a hint of consciousness. He seemed to know that by continuously devouring these remnants, he could become whole.

At this point, there were no stronger remnants beneath the platform than Luo Tian. He kept devouring, gradually strengthening himself. Yet he never climbed onto the platform.

For some reason, Luo Tian always felt that while the platform attracted him, it also filled him with fear.

With a hint of intelligence, Luo Tian decided to first devour all the remnants beneath the platform to strengthen himself before ascending.

After an unknown time, Luo Tian finally devoured all the remnants around the platform. His soul had fully transformed into a human shape, though slightly blurred, one could still vaguely recognize it as Luo Tian.

“After devouring the contents above, I’ll recover, right?” His soul roared, rushing toward the platform without hesitation.

As soon as he reached the platform, a soul much larger than his appeared before him, overwhelming Luo Tian with fear and even making him want to worship.

But the temptation of recovery drew him in, and he rushed toward this soul, which was half his size.

This was the most difficult step for Luo Tian in this space. Two souls continuously devoured each other, like a primal battle.

Meanwhile, outside, Qiu Taiping and Bu Jingtian’s fight was nearing its end.

Luo Tian and Bu Jingtian’s bodies clashed repeatedly, emitting thunderous sounds. The surrounding area was in ruins; even the void fissures around them seemed larger, and the space within several miles felt unstable.

Qiu Taiping had the advantage in every aspect. Through his battle with Bu Jingtian, he had fused with Luo Tian’s body to ninety percent.

Initially, Bu Jingtian could still fight using his soul advantage, but as Qiu Taiping fused with Luo Tian’s body, Bu Jingtian became the one being beaten.

“Die! Your soul is mine!” Qiu Taiping’s face showed wild laughter, his foot stomping down like clouds of祥气 (auspicious energy), crushing Bu Jingtian’s chest.

“Crack!” Bu Jingtian’s chest was instantly crushed, revealing his beating heart.

“Damn it!” Bu Jingtian trembled in his heart. His hard-earned body was now crushed by a single footstep, making him feel pain.

But the pain lasted only an instant. Before he could react, Luo Tian’s seven-colored fist smashed into Bu Jingtian’s head.

“Boom!” Bu Jingtian’s head exploded like a watermelon, scattering into blood mist.

A wisp of gray gas escaped Bu Jingtian’s body, clearly visible as an old man. If it weren’t for the gray color, it would look like a normal human.

“Come here!” Luo Tian’s face showed joy, his eyes greedy as he roared and extended his hand. A powerful suction surged toward the old man’s form.

The gray figure looked terrified, its body drifting toward Luo Tian’s hand involuntarily.

“Earlier I said you weren’t my match. You still insisted on resisting. Now it’s too late to submit!” Luo Tian smiled, watching the old man’s soul struggling closer.

“Qiu Taiping, I’ll fight you to the death!” The old man roared, his soul energy burning. His body moved forward instead of backward, rushing into Luo Tian’s body.

It seemed he was caught off guard by the old man’s move, but his eyes showed no panic. Instead, he looked at him like a fool.

“Damn it! How did this Luo Tian have the Soul-Subduing Cauldron!” Bu Jingtian’s soul rushed into Luo Tian’s body and cursed.

“Haha, you insisted on coming in—what did I do?” Qiu Taiping’s voice echoed afterward, laughing.

Hearing Qiu Taiping’s laughter, Bu Jingtian grew even angrier, wishing to devour him alive.

As soon as Bu Jingtian’s soul entered Luo Tian’s body, he realized that Luo Tian had fused with it to ninety percent.

Moreover, Qiu Taiping’s soul was stronger than his. Though so, Bu Jingtian could sense that Qiu Taiping’s soul was constantly weakening.

Bu Jingtian had confidence in regaining one-tenth of his body and waiting for Qiu Taiping’s soul to weaken before gradually consuming him.

But Bu Jingtian hadn’t expected that as soon as he entered Luo Tian’s body, his soul became uncontrollable. This reminded him of a treasure from his long-time enemy—the Soul-Subduing Cauldron.

Chapter 420: Luo Tian’s Return

Bu Jingtian was completely panicked, the first time in his long life encountering such a situation. As soon as his soul entered Luo Tian’s body, it trembled uncontrollably, a powerful force gradually absorbing it.

He knew where the soul was going—because of the Soul-Subduing Cauldron. His entire soul was constantly weakening, and now he finally understood why Qiu Taiping’s soul also consumed so quickly.

“This was your own doing, saving me a lot of trouble!” Qiu Taiping chuckled, his face showing satisfaction. With Bu Jingtian’s addition, his soul consumption dropped by more than half.

But Qiu Taiping didn’t plan to let Bu Jingtian go, instead directing his soul energy toward him.

Though Qiu Taiping had lost over forty percent of his soul, he was still a peak soul cultivator. Even after losing much, he was stronger than Bu Jingtian’s early-stage soul.

“I’ll fight you to the death!” Bu Jingtian roared, having no path back. Though he knew he wasn’t Qiu Taiping’s match, he rushed toward him desperately.

“Crack!” Qiu Taiping bit off one of Bu Jingtian’s arms, fusing it into his soul. His face showed ecstasy.

“Excellent! This soul of Bone-Consuming Stage, though a remnant, is far stronger than those of the Bone-Consuming Stage!” Qiu Taiping’s soul instantly recovered to about fifty percent.

“Ah…” Bu Jingtian went completely mad, his soul burning fiercely and transforming into a flame that rushed toward Qiu Taiping.

“Self-destructing!” Qiu Taiping sneered, turning into swirling gray gas and enveloping Bu Jingtian. He gradually devoured Bu Jingtian’s remnant soul.

“One hour… two hours…” Time passed slowly, and Bu Jingtian’s remnant soul was too weak. Yet he still lasted two hours.

After two hours, Qiu Taiping’s soul in Luo Tian’s body gradually formed a powerful aura. Qiu Taiping showed a satisfied expression.

A gray figure held a wisp of gray gas, a powerful resentment emanating from it—this was Bu Jingtian’s last remnant soul.

“Alas… surviving until the Soul-Consuming Stage, enduring this long—your perseverance is admirable. If you had submitted to me from the start, I would have spared your life. But now… you’ve missed my chance!” Qiu Taiping sighed slightly, opening his mouth to suck in the gray gas into his soul.

Under Qiu Taiping’s suction, Bu Jingtian—this immortal-level sage who had lived for millions of years—disintegrated completely from the Tianyuan Continent.

“I’ve recovered, so let’s fully merge with this body! From now on, I shall be Luo Tian!” After absorbing Bu Jingtian’s soul, Qiu Taiping’s soul was fully restored. He roared, and his soul instantly merged into every part of Luo Tian’s body—not a single hair was left.

“Ninety percent… ninety-nine percent…” Within less than half a bell, Qiu Taiping had fused to ninety-nine percent. Only one-tenth remained before fully merging with Luo Tian’s body.

“Hmm? What is this?” When Qiu Taiping fused into the golden mind-sea, he discovered a small golden dot. If it weren’t for this tiny dot preventing complete fusion with the body, he wouldn’t have noticed it.

Soul energy instantly surged toward this golden dot, attempting to fuse with it and fully merge with this powerful body.

But soon Qiu Taiping trembled, as his soul energy was absorbed into the dot immediately after wrapping it.

“This… this… why another one! Well, a little more or less doesn’t matter! I’ll refine the Soul-Subduing Cauldron first!” Qiu Taiping’s mouth twitched.

Qiu Taiping was scared, fearing another item like the Soul-Subduing Cauldron. Otherwise, he would be doomed for sure.

He no longer considered this golden light and instantly directed his powerful soul energy into the Soul-Subduing Cauldron, continuing to refine it. He seemed to have forgotten that he had once been a complete soul but was reduced to only two-tenths by the Soul-Subduing Cauldron.

In the Chronicle of Epochs, Luo Tian’s battle was nearing its end. A powerful gray gas slowly coalesced, and Luo Tian’s soul appeared in the vast space.

“I… am back!” The gray soul roared, his face showing a clear expression.

At this moment, Luo Tian had fully recovered. All he needed was to exit this gray space and return to his body, completing his recovery.
