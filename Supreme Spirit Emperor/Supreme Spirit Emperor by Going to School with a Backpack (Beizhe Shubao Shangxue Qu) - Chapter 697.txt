“Hmm!” Luotian nodded. Though he wasn’t certain if the Demon Lord had gone there, he declared it so now, leaving others in ignorance.

“Yi Jianren—was it you who killed him?” Huangtian’s Grand Master, who had remained silent, finally spoke, his gaze fixed on Luotian.

“Sort of,” Luotian nodded. He knew the truth could not be hidden forever; Huangtian’s Grand Master would eventually learn it.

“Yi Jianren was a Hellish Messenger. You dared to kill one!” Ye Qiu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

“Apologies, but even if you knew the location of Luosheng Gate’s main base, you could only die in Hell!” A Saint Prince spoke.

Not killing Luotian would leave Hell’s dignity in tatters. Upon hearing the Saint Prince’s words, Huangtian’s Grand Master smiled faintly.

“First I’ll shatter one of your soul fragments; later, I’ll come to the Reincarnation Hall and destroy you!” Huangtian’s Grand Master raised his hand, slapping it toward Luotian.

“You dare!” Hei Bai Wu Chang’s expressions were cold as they raised their hands to block Huangtian’s descending palm.

Boom…

The space trembled. The Saint Princes’ faces shifted slightly, their gazes turning to Hei Bai Wu Chang and Huangtian’s Grand Master. They hadn’t expected these two to act here.

“Hei Bai Wu Chang, you’ve overstepped. This boy is no longer a Reincarnation Hall disciple!” One Grand Master spoke, his gaze turning to Luotian.

“I think he should be killed!” Another Grand Master added, his voice laced with amusement—clearly dismissing Luotian.

“With me here, he won’t be killed!” Hei Bai Wu Chang’s brows furrowed. Logically, these people should know Luotian’s identity, yet someone still wanted him dead—this was suspicious.

“Hei Bai Wu Chang, you can’t protect him!” Fengdu’s Grand Master spoke, his gaze locking with Hei Bai Wu Chang.

“I can protect him!” Just as Fengdu’s Grand Master finished speaking, a soft sigh echoed through the space, causing even the Ten Court Judges to shift slightly.

Chapter 2610: Unparalleled Power

“Who!” Upon hearing the voice, the Ten Court Judges’ faces changed abruptly. This voice did not belong to any of them—it was foreign.

“Good evening!” As they gasped, a phantom figure materialized within the space, smiling.

The apparition gradually solidified into an old man’s form, his gaze sweeping over them.

“Wang Xianzhe!” Luotian’s face showed disbelief. He hadn’t expected Wang Duantian to appear here.

“Who are you?” The Ten Judges’ eyes narrowed with suspicion. This space was their joint creation; this old man’s silent entry had exceeded all expectations.

“Who I am doesn’t matter. It was I who killed the Saint Prince of Huangtian. If you seek revenge, I’ll accompany you—right now, I’m outside Huangtian’s gates!” Wang Duantian smiled, addressing Huangtian’s Grand Master.

“Outside Huangtian’s gates?” Upon hearing Wang Duantian’s words, the crowd inhaled sharply. They hadn’t expected this old man to be so bold.

“I’ll challenge you!” Huangtian’s Grand Master sneered, vanishing into the space.

Huangtian’s Grand Master spoke, and his form vanished from that space, causing the onlookers to erupt in chaos.

“Unparalleled!” Luotian sighed, having already regarded Wang Duantian highly—but he hadn’t expected this old man to achieve such feats.

“Wait,” Ye Fengdu’s eyes darkened. Regardless of how Wang Duantian had entered this space, it proved his extraordinary nature.

Outside Huangtian’s gates stood an old man with hands clasped behind his back, gazing toward the location of Huangtian. It was Wang Duantian.

Wang Duantian stood at the gates of Huangtian, yet the disciples of Huangtian seemed blind to him. Some even passed by Wang Duantian without noticing.

Three seconds later, a stern old man materialized before Wang Duantian, their gazes locking across a hundred zhang.

Thunderous roars echoed constantly; the terrifying truth was that Huangtian’s disciples remained unaware of Wang Duantian’s presence, oblivious to the two titans clashing outside.

They stood silently, their gazes locked on each other. Huangtian’s Grand Master was like a hawk waiting for its prey to falter, ready to strike at the first opportunity.

Wang Duantian smiled, his hands clasped behind him, gazing at Huangtian’s Grand Master without the slightest discomfort.

“Huangtian’s Grand Master, is it enough?” Wang Duantian addressed Huangtian’s Grand Master, and as his words ended, he took a small step forward.

Boom…

The atmosphere surged violently. Huangtian’s Grand Master saw the scene shift—endless divine power coalesced into a towering wave, crashing toward him.

“Terrifying!” Huangtian’s Grand Master’s face contorted, but he met the assault head-on. He took a step forward, and with that, the sound of the Dao roared as he clashed against Wang Duantian.

“Indeed, Huangtian’s Grand Master!” Wang Duantian’s eyes flickered with surprise as he took another step.

The thunderous sound echoed in Huangtian’s Grand Master’s ears, and in an instant, his aura was suppressed like waves crashing against a shore.

Buzz…

As that aura struck Huangtian’s Grand Master, his breath wavered, and his face paled abruptly.

Wind stirred; Huangtian’s Grand Master appeared before the disciples’ eyes.

“Grand Master!” The disciples of Huangtian gaped in shock, startled by the sudden appearance. One even nearly collided with Huangtian’s Grand Master.

“You’ve lost. Please don’t trouble my junior,” Wang Duantian smiled, gazing at Huangtian’s Grand Master.

“Damn it!” Huangtian’s Grand Master cursed inwardly, his gaze fixed on Wang Duantian while marveling at his strength.

“Respectful greetings, Grand Master!” The disciples of Huangtian bowed reverently to their Grand Master, pulling him back to his senses.

“Hmph,” Huangtian’s Grand Master’s face darkened as he strode away, leaving the disciples in bewilderment.

…

In the dark space, Luotian and others waited for Wang Duantian and Huangtian’s Grand Master. At last, a figure appeared, causing the onlookers to gape.

“It’s him—the Huangtian Grand Master?” A Saint Prince gasped, surprised by how swiftly Wang Duantian had defeated Huangtian’s Grand Master.

“Master!” Luotian’s heart soared; since Wang Duantian had arrived first, the result was obvious.

A moment later, Huangtian’s Grand Master appeared with a dark face, gazing at Wang Duantian without speaking.

“Defeated,” the others mused; if this man’s pride hadn’t been shattered, he would’ve already exploded.

“Now do you have the right to protect him?” Wang Duantian smiled, gazing at the Ten Court Judges.

Luotian’s heart churned; he hadn’t expected Wang Duantian to truly subdue Huangtian’s Grand Master. Though he knew Wang Duantian was strong, his gap against these peak Immortal Kings remained.

“Did he seal his power in the Middle Heavens?” Luotian mused, convinced Wang Duantian had restrained his strength.

“Do you have a plan? Even if you possess this power, we won’t allow Tianyuan Sect to exist. Unless you can match all ten of us!” Ye Fengdu spoke, now united with the Ten Court Judges. He doubted Wang Duantian could fight ten alone—especially since Hell’s depth ran deeper than that.

“Of course, I mean to give them a chance.”

“A chance for them to stand alone!” Wang Duantian spoke softly.

“Understood,” the others murmured, their expressions shifting. This was a rare sight for Hei Bai Wu Chang and the others.

“If this face isn’t granted, I have no choice,” Wang Duantian spoke softly, tucking the token away.

“This token—where did you get it?” Ye Fengdu’s gaze was heavy; the token’s origin was too significant.

“Gifted by someone. As for who, you should know better than I,” Wang Duantian spoke softly, and the Ten Court Judges fell silent.

Chapter 2611: Marching to the Main Base

“What’s your plan?” After a pause, Ye Fengdu asked, gazing at Wang Duantian.

“Let him face eight Saint Princes alone. If he wins, Tianyuan Sect will be independent; if he loses, it will submit.”

“I assume none of you lack confidence in your own Saint Princes,” Wang Duantian smiled, addressing the Ten Grand Masters.

“Arrogant!” The Grand Masters hadn’t yet spoken when the Saint Princes erupted, their faces flushed with anger. Wang Duantian’s words clearly belittled them.

Luotian was strong—this they admitted—but fighting eight alone was an insult.

“Interesting,” Ye Fengdu’s eyes flickered with amusement; he hadn’t expected this sudden strength to speak so boldly.

“Then it’s decided. All of you come to my Reincarnation Hall!” Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke, gazing deeply at Luotian.

“Good. We’ll arrive within three days,” the Ten Court Judges set a time, and the group exited the space.

“Boy, I’ve secured this much for you—now it’s up to you,” Wang Duantian smiled, his form gradually fading.

“Good!” Luotian nodded; this was the opportunity Wang Duantian had fought for. He couldn’t afford to waste it.

Buzz…

As the hum faded, Luotian and Hei Bai Wu Chang returned to normality, encountering the several Celestial Lords.

“Grand Master, what happened?” The Celestial Lords inquired, unaware of the developments.

“Wait and see,” Hei Bai Wu Chang replied, then turned to Luotian: “Do you have a chance?”

“Fifty-fifty. After all, these guys have improved over the years,” Luotian smiled.

“Good!” Hei Bai Wu Chang was surprised; he hadn’t expected Luotian to be so confident—facing eight alone with a fifty-fifty chance.

“By the way, do you know where Luosheng Gate’s main base is?” Hei Bai Wu Chang then asked, his gaze turning serious.

The Celestial Lords also straightened their postures, gazing at Luotian.

Luosheng Gate’s threat surpassed Tianyuan Sect’s, so the Ten Court Judges weren’t as dismissive as before.

“Sort of,” Luotian gazed at the Celestial Lords, observing their expressions without detecting anything unusual.

“I’m not entirely sure,” he also conveyed mentally to Hei Bai Wu Chang, revealing the truth—his encounter with the Demon Lord.

“It’s probably not the main base. We’ve found clues about Luosheng Gate before, encountering places with Immortal Kings. I suspect what you described is a major outpost.”

“But it must be eradicated—perhaps there’ll be unexpected gains,” Hei Bai Wu Chang replied.

“Let’s go. Let’s find the big fish!” Hei Bai Wu Chang addressed the Celestial Lords, leading them out of Reincarnation Hall.

“Yes!” The Celestial Lords trembled, following Hei Bai Wu Chang’s lead as they soared into the air outside Reincarnation Hall.

But as soon as they appeared at the gates, they caught whiffs of fragrance and saw a large pot outside, its contents bubbling with heat.

Chen Zhanbiao held a bowl, unsure of what it was; he occasionally plucked a piece of meat and tasted it.

“Zhanbiao!” Luotian’s eyes flickered; he could sense the Celestial Lords’ anger at cooking outside Reincarnation Hall.

“Big brother, I’m so hungry—can you eat?” Chen Zhanbiao saw Luotian’s expression and stood up immediately, holding the bowl toward him with a foolish grin.

“Zhanbiao’s learned bad habits from these guys!” Luotian sighed internally; if it were earlier, Chen Zhanbiao would never have acted this way.

“Overstepping! Too overstepping!” Jueying Celestial Lord spoke, gazing at the bubbling pot.

“Indeed, but what is this?” A Celestial Lord of early Immortal King stage asked, eyeing the meat in the pot.

“This is delicious—would you like to try?” Chen Zhanbiao, sensing their anger, quickly addressed the Celestial Lords. He knew nothing could be solved without food.

“This kid’s improved!” Luotian smiled softly; Chen Zhanbiao’s act was an insult to Reincarnation Hall for others, but for Luotian, it wasn’t a big deal. The Celestial Lords’ anger would subside.

“Ha! We’ll be bold!” A loud laugh made Luotian’s jaw drop.

In disbelief, the Celestial Lords approached the pot and began to skillfully use chopsticks, plucking meat and vegetables from it.

“Hmm, truly delicious. When I attacked the Celestial Heavens before, I ate their food and found it very good. But this is even better!”

“Indeed, what is this?” The Celestial Lords clamored for it, their behavior unbecoming of their status.

“Dip some sauce—it’s better!” Chen Zhanbiao smiled, enthusiastically joining the Celestial Lords.

“Rascals…” Hei Bai Wu Chang glared at the Celestial Lords’ shameless behavior, anger rising. It felt embarrassing.

“Grand Master, would you like some? Truly delicious!” The Celestial Lords straightened their postures, wiping their mouths and gazing at Hei Bai Wu Chang.

“Eat! All you think about is eating. I’d rather starve than eat this disgraceful thing!” Hei Bai Wu Chang waved his sleeve, and the Celestial Lords and Chen Zhanbiao vanished from Reincarnation Hall’s gates.

“Let’s go—two of us will make a trip!” Hei Bai Wu Chang gazed at Luotian, his face flushed despite his stoic demeanor.

“Good!” Luotian didn’t mind; with Hei Bai Wu Chang around, his safety should be assured.

“Lu Xiong, wait for me!” As the two prepared to move, Jie Du emerged from Reincarnation Hall.

“Let’s go—together!” Luotian didn’t refuse; the three of them soared into the air, guided by Luotian toward the array the Demon Lord had entered.

With Hei Bai Wu Chang around, Luotian and Jie Du’s speed increased significantly. In half a day, the three arrived at that mountain.

“This array is indeed formidable!” Hei Bai Wu Chang’s eyes brightened, sensing a big catch within.

Chapter 2612: Unforeseen

Outside the black mountain, Luotian, Hei Bai Wu Chang, and Jie Du stood, gazing at the mountain. From outside, it appeared ordinary.

But Luotian and his companions were no ordinary men; they could sense the array’s fluctuations.

“If not for knowing it was here, no one would care,” Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke softly, raising his hand to strike the black mountain.

A black palm surged with terrifying energy, instantly descending upon the mountain. Before it struck, a wave of power erupted from the void, blocking Hei Bai Wu Chang’s attack.

Boom…

Thunderous sounds echoed across the heavens; Hei Bai Wu Chang’s palm was formidable. The array surrounding the mountain shattered with a crash.

The world trembled, time and space twisted; as the array was destroyed, the mountain’s interior revealed itself.

“Who!” A cry echoed; figures emerged—dozens of people, all clad in black robes. Each exuded formidable power, their attire marking them as Luosheng Gate disciples.

“Good,” Hei Bai Wu Chang nodded, his hands moving swiftly to grasp the void. The entire sky trembled as millions of zhang were sealed, trapping all within.

“Two Immortal Kings at the middle stage!” Hei Bai Wu Chang’s eyes flickered with amusement. In Luosheng Gate, such strength was surely high-ranking.

“Who are you?” A towering figure emerged, his head crowned with twin horns, radiating cold light. But upon seeing Luotian, his heart chilled.

“Luotian!” The Demon Lord’s eyes widened in disbelief, recalling their encounter in Black Cloud City.

“Tracked?” The Demon Lord mused internally; he now knew it wasn’t about how he was discovered but about escaping.

“Master, I’ll fight!” Luotian addressed Hei Bai Wu Chang, giving him a meaningful glance.

“Good,” Hei Bai Wu Chang, shrewd as ever, understood Luotian’s intent and didn’t stop him.

“By three of you, dare to come here and cause trouble! We’ll capture you for a reward!” The Demon Lord roared, his upper robe tearing to reveal a crimson chest marked with strange runes.

Two black wings unfurled, appearing dry but radiating explosive power.

“Remember me?” Luotian smiled, gazing at the Demon Lord as he summoned his Black Shattering Spear.

“Run!” But the Demon Lord flapped his wings, tearing through space and fleeing.

“Flee? We have the advantage!” The others gaped, watching the Demon Lord escape. They had just boasted about capturing Luotian but now fled first.

“Luotian!” From the back of the crowd, two glimmers shot out, causing Luotian to shiver and feel a sense of unease. He ignored the fleeing Demon Lord.

“Who!” Luotian stepped forward, thrusting his spear, its black shadow radiating divine light. It pierced the three Luosheng Gate disciples blocking his path.

Plop, plop, plop…

Blood splattered; three True Immortal Kings were pierced through the throats and fell from the sky.

“Flee…” Luotian’s swift strike killed three, causing the others to scatter in panic.

But with Hei Bai Wu Chang sealing space, none could escape. A wave of black light surged for tens of thousands of zhang but was halted by immense pressure, preventing even the Demon Lord and his companion from moving.

As people scattered, Luotian spotted a figure at the back of the crowd.

A cold glimmer radiated with boundless resentment, its face obscured by black mist. Yet the woman’s figure was unmistakable—Leng Qiuchan.

“Roar…” A roar echoed; Luotian’s gaze dropped, seeing a black wolf beside her.

A wolf, its fur entirely black, eyes pale blue, fangs bared—its gaze was fierce and filled with resentment.

“This is…” Luotian trembled, recognizing the black wolf as the one that had followed Leng Qiuchan. Though its color changed, its appearance remained unchanged.

“Leng Qiuchan!” Luotian gasped, recognizing the figure after a moment’s thought.

The black wolf was indeed the one that had followed Leng Qiuchan, but now it was a different color.

“Luotian, I didn’t expect to meet you,” the cold voice echoed from within the mist, causing Luotian’s heart to ache.

Luotian had planned to find Leng Qiuchan after resolving Tianyuan Sect’s matters. He knew he had wounded her deeply before.

But he hadn’t expected to meet her here, and she had joined Luosheng Gate.

“Kill!” As Luotian’s heart ached, one woman and wolf charged toward him. The green sword radiated coldness, emotionless as it slashed at Luotian.

“Leng Qiuchan, I’m sorry!” Luotian roared, raising his Black Shattering Spear to block the green sword’s tip. In an instant, he retreated.

As he retreated, a wolf appeared behind him, snapping at his back. Luotian’s heart ached more.

“Little wolf!” Luotian roared, turning abruptly and reaching for the wolf’s body.

“Don’t harm!” Luotian couldn’t bear to hurt Leng Qiuchan or the wolf. His palm struck the wolf, but it only retreated.

“Memory restored?” Leng Qiuchan was pushed back by Luotian’s spear, her voice laced with mockery.

“I’m sorry!” Luotian’s face bore deep regret, gazing at Leng Qiuchan.

“It’s too late!” Her cold voice struck Luotian like a bucket of water, and another wave of cold light surged toward him.

Roar…

The wolf howled, its form lightning-fast as it appeared behind Luotian and lunged for his back.

Luotian swung his spear, clashing with the green sword again and repelling Leng Qiuchan’s attack. But his back was bitten by the wolf’s sharp teeth, blood seeping through his clothes.

“Little one, you really mean it!” Luotian inwardly cursed, reaching for the wolf while summoning two dark lights. A plump figure appeared beside him.

Chapter 2613: Capturing Leng Qiuchan

“Beat him, but don’t kill!” Luotian addressed the two big dogs, his voice laced with amusement. He ignored others and gazed at Leng Qiuchan again.

“Leng Qiuchan, I was wrong. Let me make it up to you—will you come back with me?” Luotian’s face bore regret, his gaze sincere.

Luotian truly felt he owed Leng Qiuchan much. Though there had been reasons, his coldness at the time had shattered her heart completely.

Upon hearing Luotian’s words, Leng Qiuchan’s black mist parted slightly, her emotions clearly stirred.

“I said it’s too late!” Yet she remained cold, her green sword turning and slicing toward Luotian.

The green blade radiated icy energy; Luotian’s face finally changed. He didn’t know why Leng Qiuchan was like this, but he had clearly felt her emotional shift—she still cared.

Crash…

Luotian’s spear blocked the green blade, splintering it before him. Blood trickled from his lips.

Luotian sighed internally; Leng Qiuchan’s strength had grown immensely—even he struggled to withstand it.

He didn’t know the Demon Lord’s current strength, but Luotian was certain Leng Qiuchan’s power wasn’t far behind.

“Not fighting back? Think I won’t kill you?” Leng Qiuchan sneered, raising her sword and charging toward Luotian.

“Leng Qiuchan, let me explain!” Luotian raised his Black Shattering Spear, beginning to block Leng Qiuchan’s attacks.

Meanwhile, the Demon Lord and others despairingly realized they couldn’t break through the overwhelming pressure.

“Let’s fight!” The Demon Lord’s companion glared, his gaze turning to Hei Bai Wu Chang and Jie Du. He soared into the air, rushing toward Luotian who was blocking Leng Qiuchan’s attack.

Crack…
Spikes erupted from the middle-aged man’s back, and his body transformed.

A black beast appeared before Luotian—resembling a corpse-eater but far more sinister.

“Ah, it’s a Gold-Eating Ghost!” Luotian’s eyes narrowed; he recognized the creature.

Though similar to corpse-eaters, Gold-Eating Ghosts were rare and far superior. Their bodies bristled with spikes—main attack tools.

Yet the Demon Lord didn’t retreat but continued to charge against Hei Bai Wu Chang’s pressure.

In an instant, the Gold-Eating Ghost rushed toward Luotian, spinning rapidly and crashing into him.

“I can’t fight my wife, but what else am I afraid of?” Luotian’s eyes flashed coldly as his Black Shattering Spear radiated waves.

The Dao surged, and Luotian moved—his spear sweeping in an arc toward the Gold-Eating Ghost.

“Ah!” Jie Du, watching the battle, suddenly saw Luotian’s spear and his eyes flashed with divine light.

“That’s fishing!” Jie Du realized, recalling their earlier fishing trip with Wang Duantian. The arc of the spear mirrored Luotian’s rod-throwing motion then.

“Boom…” As Jie Du was stunned, the Black Shattering Spear shattered space and struck the spinning Gold-Eating Ghost.

Crack…
Spikes fell from the sky, and the Gold-Eating Ghost’s body was instantly repelled. A cloud of blood appeared in the heavens.

The Gold-Eating Ghost flew back a thousand zhang but was now battered, its spikes broken and bloodied. Its chest caved in.

The Gold-Eating Ghost fell to the ground, crashing into it—just one strike had rendered it helpless.

Difference: The Gold-Eating Ghost was at the early Immortal King stage, lower than the Demon Lord and Leng Qiuchan. Now, even an early Immortal King was no match for Luotian.

But as Luotian struck the Gold-Eating Ghost, a sense of danger surged through him. His face shifted slightly.

Luotian raised his hand, grabbing his ear—pain shot through him. The green sword was now in his grasp.

Blood stained the blade; Luotian raised it, instinctively swinging a fist toward Leng Qiuchan.

The fist wind surged; it nearly struck Leng Qiuchan’s head but stopped, dispersing the black mist and revealing her face—pale yet devoid of emotion.

Luotian gazed at her beauty, but her face was pale and lifeless, causing his heart to clench.

“Leng Qiuchan, come back with me!” Luotian extended a hand, casting the first gesture of the Hundred Demons Seal. He intended to subdue her and take her back—otherwise, letting her return to Luosheng Gate would be too dangerous.

But he underestimated Leng Qiuchan’s strength; as the Hundred Demons Seal fell, she swiftly drew the green sword from Luotian’s grasp.

“I can’t kill you now, but one day I’ll kill this heartless man!” Leng Qiuchan’s cold voice echoed, and she soared into the sky, fleeing. Her wolf companion also broke free from Hei Bai Wu Chang’s grip and rushed toward her.

“Master Hei Bai Wu Chang, help me catch her!” Luotian addressed Hei Bai Wu Chang, his voice laced with urgency.

“Good!” Hei Bai Wu Chang nodded and raised his hand, summoning a black-and-white palm to grasp Leng Qiuchan.

The palm descended instantly, seizing her.

“I’ll die before returning with you!” Leng Qiuchan roared, struggling desperately but failing to escape.

Meanwhile, the Demon Lord seemed to take advantage of Hei Bai Wu Chang’s focus on Leng Qiuchan, his strength waning. His crimson wings tore through space, and he spat blood—escaping Hei Bai Wu Chang’s grip.

“Ha!” The Demon Lord laughed, fleeing immediately. Luotian and Hei Bai Wu Chang exchanged glances but ignored it.

Chapter 2614: Healing

The black-and-white palm seized Leng Qiuchan, who struggled desperately but failed.

“Little girl, you can’t escape. Return and talk things over with this boy—bedroom quarrels end in reconciliation!” Hei Bai Wu Chang smiled, his overwhelming pressure descending.

Crack…
A cloud of blood rose; those who hadn’t escaped were all turned into blood mist, showcasing the terrifying power of an Immortal King at the peak.

Jie Du sighed; Hei Bai Wu Chang had acted too quickly, leaving no time for persuasion. He could only watch as they died.

“I’ll die before letting you catch me!” Leng Qiuchan’s face was pale, her black mist vanishing to reveal a pale face.

“Leng Qiuchan, I was wrong. Give me a chance, please!” Luotian gazed at her, his heart feeling like it was being cut.

“We’ve been married for years—back then I lost my memory, and I don’t remember anyone else!” Luotian shouted, watching her struggle.

“It’s too late!” Leng Qiuchan gazed at Luotian, her eyes still devoid of emotion. Blood mist rose from her body; red veins appeared on her face, making it grotesque.

“Damn it!” Hei Bai Wu Chang sensed Leng Qiuchan’s condition and loosened his grip.

As Hei Bai Wu Chang released her, Leng Qiuchan’s mouth spat black blood and fell from the sky.

“Roar…” The wolf howled, rushing to Leng Qiuchan’s side and catching her mid-air. It became a black lightning bolt, fleeing toward the distance.

“Leng Qiuchan!” Luotian’s eyes flickered; he clearly felt her condition was poor, something had changed. He soared after her.

But as Luotian moved, Hei Bai Wu Chang grabbed him: “Boy, don’t chase her. Let her find a place to heal—this is all you can do now!”

“Why?” Luotian’s brows furrowed, gazing at Hei Bai Wu Chang. He believed returning Leng Qiuchan to Reincarnation Hall or Tianyuan Sect would be better.

“Her body contains a terrifying aura. I released her because of it; if she unleashed it, she wouldn’t survive!” Hei Bai Wu Chang shook his head.

“What aura?” Upon hearing Hei Bai Wu Chang’s words, Luotian’s heart dropped. He knew Leng Qiuchan’s sudden rise to the middle Immortal King stage must have come at a cost.

“Unknown—this aura is strange, so I dared not act,” Hei Bai Wu Chang shook his head, eyes filled with confusion.

“The best option now is to let her fend for herself. Luosheng Gate has grand plans; she’s no pushover. An Immortal King at the middle stage holds a high rank in Luosheng Gate, so you don’t need to worry too much,” Hei Bai Wu Chang comforted Luotian.

“Only this is possible,” Luotian’s face darkened but he had no choice but to let Leng Qiuchan go. Hei Bai Wu Chang hadn’t even managed it, so he was no match.

“Damn it!” Luotian’s eyes flashed with frustration; he swung his Black Shattering Spear, striking the black mountain.

Boom…
The black mountain crumbled violently, dust swirling as Luotian’s spear swept it flat. He felt powerless.

Luotian and Leng Qiuchan had been together on the Tianyuan Continent; he still remembered the moment she shielded him from a fatal strike. That was when he vowed to protect her. He never imagined they would end up like this.

“Is that…” As the dust settled, Luotian and Hei Bai Wu Chang’s gazes turned to the mountain now flattened.

A subterranean palace appeared, and within it, a blood pool stretched for ten thousand zhang. The pool contained numerous emaciated figures—men, women, and children.
