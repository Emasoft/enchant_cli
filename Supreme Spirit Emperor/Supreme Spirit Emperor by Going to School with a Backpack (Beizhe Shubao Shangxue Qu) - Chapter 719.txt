"Unexpectedly, a small sect like Tianyuan Sect could be so powerful!" Four Supreme Kings looked at the pitiful Hell forces, but they didn't rush because their arrival already meant this battle was over.

"Lu Tian!" The four men directed their gaze to Lu Tian, eyes filled with admiration but eventually replaced by coldness.

"Give you a chance. All above the Supreme King should commit suicide or be enslaved, and we might release those old and weak people!" The master of the Ku Shen Sect spoke.

"Fu Du Sect withdraws from this battle!" As soon as the master of Ku Shen Sect finished speaking, Lu Tian and others hadn't responded yet. A voice rang out, it was Ye Qiu, the Holy Son of Fu Du Sect.

"I Wu Hua Sect also withdraws from this battle... Shouruo Sect also withdraws..." Several Holy Sons spoke one after another, several forces dispersed from the Hell army.

"What's going on?" The remaining few Heaven King forces were confused, at this point these sects chose to withdraw.

"Ha! Are they scared? A reincarnation child, what's there to fear!" The master of Huang Tian Sect showed contempt in his eyes.

"Exactly, it's not the reincarnation itself. The time has come to change!" The master of Ku Shen Sect sneered, his gaze turned to Lu Tian.

"Enough. Choose whether you self-destruct or not!" The master of Huang Tian Sect didn't care, his gaze turned to Lu Tian and others.

"Self-destruct? Enslavement? Do you think it's possible?"

"Daydreaming, we would rather die in battle than surrender!" Diao Dezhu and others cursed. They knew, even if they committed suicide, the remaining people of Tianyuan Sect would not be better off, being enslaved was unthinkable.

"Then sorry, we have to kill you!" The master of Huang Tian Sect sneered and raised his hand, striking towards the people of Tianyuan Sect.

A light palm, yet it contained overwhelming divine power, covering the sky and sun. The pressure was unbearable for the people of Tianyuan Sect.

"Monkey Brother, you take it!" Lu Tian called out to Yao Chen. At this moment, only Yao Chen could withstand the attack of a Supreme King.

"Okay!" Yao Chen grinned and flew up, swinging his golden staff towards the descending hand. In an instant, the staff expanded and collided with the hand, producing a thunderous explosion that echoed throughout heaven and earth. The black hand disintegrated, while Yao Chen spat out blood and flew into the ground as a streak of light.

Boom...

A deep pit appeared, Yao Chen lay there motionless, as if dead.

"Dead! Even the monkey couldn't withstand it!" Seeing the monkey lying motionless, Diao Dezhu and others felt their hearts sink.

Yao Chen's strength was evident to all, his body was also strong. No one in Tianyuan Sect could suppress Yao Chen except for Chen Zhanbiao and Lu Tian. But now, he was knocked down by the master of Huang Tian Sect.

"Stand firm!" Lu Tian's body was surrounded by black runes, constantly etched onto his skin. His power gradually rose.

"Good!" The master of Huang Tian Sect raised his hand again, the momentum was stronger. He struck towards the people of Tianyuan Sect.

"Brave!" The Hell forces shouted, looking at the four masters with reverence. Indeed, these ten sects had high prestige in Hell.

"Damn it! I'll fight!" Zhang Chenglong gritted his teeth. At this moment, only he could take the lead.

"Two little bastards! Remember to bury me, don't let anyone dig up my grave!" Zhang Chenglong shouted and threw a yellow paper towards the hand. The paper was a talisman, accurately speaking, half of it as if torn off. However, this half-talisman exuded pressure and the power to suppress everything.

"Imperial Qi!" Seeing this half-talisman, the master of Huang Tian Sect's face slightly changed but quickly returned to normal.

The half-yellow talisman suddenly burst forth, transforming into a golden finger that radiated overwhelming power. It collided with the master of Huang Tian Sect's hand.

The thunderous sound shook the sky, the entire sky trembled. The violent waves spread over Tianyuan Mountain.

Diao Dezhu and others quickly formed a barrier, surrounding the people of Tianyuan Sect. The barrier seemed to be battered by a storm and finally calmed down after dozens of breaths.

As the barrier disappeared, Zhang Chenglong lay beside Yao Chen with numerous cracks all over his body as if it could break at any moment.

"Two of them!" The master of Huang Tian Sect looked down on the people of Tianyuan Sect and raised his hand again. He wanted to see who could withstand this attack.

"Fight all around!" Tu Shengfei gritted his teeth, holding a blood sword and rushing forward. His aura rose, and a vast amount of blood energy gathered in front of Tu Shengfei.

Boom... The blood sword collided with the black hand, breaking apart. Tu Shengfei also fell from the sky.

"Any more?" The master of Huang Tian Sect smiled, watching these people one by one coming to offer their lives.

Chapter 2719: The Peak Battle

After the master of Huang Tian Sect spoke, he raised his hand again and looked at Lu Tian and others. He wanted to see who could withstand his attack.

"Dead! Lu Tian, hurry up and fight him!" Diao Dezhu and others looked at the hand covering the sky, looking to Lu Tian. But Lu Tian seemed not to hear and sat there, black runes constantly changing and etched onto his body.

"I'm going!"

"What did you kill me? Meeting you is never good!" Tu Feiyang's face showed bitterness. He stepped forward to meet the descending hand.

Tu Feiyang knew he couldn't withstand it, but now in Tianyuan Sect, only he was a Supreme King. Who else would take the lead? However, just as Tu Feiyang got up, a streak of light rose from the earth and collided with the hand of the master of Huang Tian Sect.

Boom...

The thunderous sound shook, and the hand was shattered by a golden staff. People gasped in shock.

"Hmm?" The four masters frowned slightly and looked at Yao Chen who had risen. A wave of surprise spread, no one expected that the Yao Chen who was almost knocked down could get up again and withstand an attack of Supreme King.

"It's not his technique!" The four masters immediately realized Yao Chen's condition. They concluded that the attack surpassing Supreme King was not done by Yao Chen.

"Interesting!" The master of Huang Tian Sect raised his hand again and struck towards Yao Chen. The other three still didn't act, thinking that one master of Huang Tian was enough. It would be embarrassing for them to use all four masters against this sect.

Yao Chen looked at the hand and pulled out a hair from behind his ear. He blew, and the hair instantly expanded into a golden staff that pressed against the sky. It collided with the master of Huang Tian Sect's attack.

Another thunderous sound echoed, and the master of Huang Tian Sect's attack was again deflected and shattered in people's sight.

"My god, what is this hair? A single strand could withstand an attack of Supreme King!" Diao Dezhu and others were inspired.

"I wish I had pulled more hairs from this monkey before!" Sun Ke Nian's eyes shone as he looked at Yao Chen, making him uncomfortable.

"Pull all your hair off!" The master of Huang Tian Sect sneered and quickly changed his hands. This time, it was not just a simple attack but the use of martial arts.

Ferocious ghost energy formed into waves, like a black ocean. It finally condensed into a black seal that radiated overwhelming pressure and pressed towards Yao Chen.

Yao Chen showed no fear. He pulled out another hair, the last life-saving hair left by Dou Zhan Fo.

"Yellow Heaven Seal, one seal to determine the underworld!" The master of Huang Tian Sect pressed his hand into the void and sent a powerful seal descending.

The waves rose, and this time the golden hair did not turn into a staff but formed into divine laws. It became an actual figure.

The golden figure appeared, radiating a strong aura that made the four masters' faces show concern. They looked at this golden figure, who was similar to Yao Chen.

"Master Yao Huang Tian!" Diao Dezhu and others exclaimed, recognizing who this monkey was.

"From the Buddha Sect?"

"Not the original, it's a clone!" Seeing the golden figure, the four masters' eyes slightly narrowed and recognized the identity of this golden figure.

"Have you been forced to such a situation?" Master Yao Huang Tian's eyes showed confusion, looking at Yao Chen. However, upon seeing the four masters, his expression was relieved.

"Which strong person from Mount Xu Mi?" The master of Huang Tian Sect looked with confusion. He knew that Mount Xu Mi was a holy place of the Buddha Sect, but he had never seen such a monkey before.

The golden staff swung, and Dou Zhan Fo fought with the descending seal. The powerful seal was shattered by Dou Zhan Fo's staff, and he did not vanish but looked at the master of Huang Tian Sect with a fierce battle spirit.

"Come and fight!" Dou Zhan Fo looked at the master of Huang Tian Sect, his eyes glowing with golden light. A fierce battle spirit surged towards the master of Huang Tian Sect.

"This old monkey is really protective!" Diao Dezhu and others muttered, watching Dou Zhan Fo standing there. Although the situation was extremely dangerous, their mouths were still sharp.

"Are you afraid of me?" The master of Huang Tian Sect naturally wouldn't be afraid after being challenged by Dou Zhan Fo. He looked at Lu Tian for a moment, his eyes showing contempt.

The four masters knew that Lu Tian was activating some secret technique. However, they didn't care because no matter how strong he was, it couldn't surpass them four. This battle had no meaning for them; they could end it anytime, and no one could stop them.

As they spoke, Dou Zhan Fo and the master of Huang Tian Sect stood there. Their auras rose, and explosions kept rising in front of them.

"Are you trying to break this sky?" Dou Zhan Fo spoke softly, his staff emitting a continuous humming sound.

"Can't break it!" The master of Huang Tian Sect sneered and flipped his hand, a black cloud rising above Dou Zhan Fo's head.

The black cloud changed endlessly, forming into countless droplets that rushed towards Dou Zhan Fo. Each drop seemed ordinary but contained overwhelming power.

Dou Zhan Fo didn't panic. He pushed his golden staff and a series of staff images appeared, rapidly rotating into a storm that swept the sky. Boom...

The storm rolled through heaven and earth, sweeping those black raindrops into the storm, producing a thunderous sound. At the same time, Dou Zhan Fo stepped on the sky and rushed towards the master of Huang Tian Sect. The master of Huang Tian Sect also waved his hand, and a black sword appeared in his hand, clashing with Dou Zhan Fo continuously.

A battle of Supreme King巅峰, destroying heaven and earth. The people of Tianyuan Sect sighed in relief, temporarily no longer in danger.

However, everyone knew that Dou Zhan Fo wouldn't last long because he wasn't the original but a clone.

Crackling sounds echoed from Lu Tian's body, and he slowly stood up. His whole body was filled with black energy as if something had forcibly elevated him, and his body had many cracks.

A pressure spread. Lu Tian's eyes became deep and cold. He looked at the other three masters standing in the sky.

"Hmm?" The gaze of Lu Tian made the three masters frown slightly and turned their attention to Lu Tian.

"Supreme King!" The three masters looked at Lu Tian, and their previously calm eyes finally changed.

"Everyone, stay away!" Lu Tian called to Jiang Sixi and others. He stepped on the ground and rushed towards them.

Lu Tian knew he didn't have much time. This state wouldn't last long, but at this moment, he felt an extraordinary strength. He had to try his best to hurt these masters so that they might leave.

Chapter 2720: Counterattack against Tai Ping Sect Master

A powerful aura radiated from Lu Tian's body. He transformed into a streak of divine light, rushing towards the three Supreme Kings.

"This is his secret technique!" Everyone was shocked and looked at Lu Tian with disbelief, especially the ten sects' holy sons. They hadn't expected that Lu Tian had such a technique.

This rush made the ten sects' holy sons feel they were getting further away from Lu Tian, needing to look up at him.

"Entering the peak of a secret technique? With just this ability, dare you attack us three?" The three masters sneered. Although Lu Tian's aura was strong, it wasn't enough for them.

"I'll kill him to prevent long-term problems!" Tai Ping Sect Master sneered. For many years, besides the few peak strengths of the Nine Immortal Mountains, Lu Tian was the second person who dared to attack them. The first one was Dou Zhan Fo, currently clashing with the master of Huang Tian Sect.

Lu Tian transformed into a demon king. His demonic energy formed armor covering his body, and he held the Rupture Spear, thrusting it forward.

The spear pierced through space as if transcending time. People only heard a series of explosions, and they couldn't see the spear's image.

Tai Ping Sect Master slightly narrowed his eyes. His five fingers formed a claw and grabbed into the void. In an instant, the spear tip seemed to stop in front of Tai Ping Sect Master's claw.

Lu Tian and Tai Ping Sect Master stood still, only the humming sound of the spear was heard. The spear gradually bent.

"You're still inexperienced!" Tai Ping Sect Master spoke softly and then his other hand struck towards Lu Tian.

"Six Paths of Reincarnation!" Lu Tian shouted. He didn't fear Tai Ping Sect Master's hand and clenched the Rupture Spear against it. His left hand formed six whirlwinds, sweeping the sky and colliding with Tai Ping Sect Master's palm.

Boom... Boom... Boom...

Six explosions, six whirlwinds shattered under the collision between Lu Tian and Tai Ping Sect Master. Lu Tian's body was also pushed back, spitting out blood.

Tai Ping Sect Master's body trembled and took two steps back in the sky. His eyes were surprised, looking at Lu Tian.

"Indeed, a reincarnation child. He has the blood of reincarnation!" Tai Ping Sect Master's eyes showed admiration, but it soon turned into a killing intent that became stronger.

Lu Tian wiped the blood from his lips and didn't hesitate. He stepped into the sky again, holding the Rupture Spear towards Tai Ping Sect Master.

"Go down!" Tai Ping Sect Master struck his hand, then rushed toward Lu Tian. However, it was pierced by Lu Tian's spear and continued to rush towards Tai Ping Sect Master.

Tai Ping Sect Master's face finally changed. He had a long sword in his hand and slashed towards Lu Tian, clashing with the Rupture Spear.

Crack... Thunderous sound. Lu Tian felt his entire arm numb, almost losing the Rupture Spear. His body was pushed back again but not as messy as before.

"Can't beat him!" Lu Tian's heart sank. He looked at Tai Ping Sect Master, who was also pushed back but still had a gap between them.

Jiang Sixi and Diao Dezhu watched Lu Tian anxiously. At this moment, Dou Zhan Fo and the master of Huang Tian Sect were at a fierce battle. One staff against one sword, they destroyed heaven and earth. Although Dou Zhan Fo was a clone, his power was astonishing and showed no weakness.

Time slowly passed. Everyone focused on these two battlefields, but the Hell people knew that it was just four peak strengths not wanting to lose face. If they wanted to end the battle, all four peak strengths would attack together and no one could stop them.

An hour passed. Dou Zhan Fo's face slightly changed, his body gradually disintegrated and finally collapsed into the golden staff.

Woo...

A pressure descended. A supreme battle spirit transformed into an overwhelming power, sweeping towards the master of Huang Tian Sect.

"Yellow Heaven's Anger!" Seeing this world-shaking attack, the master of Huang Tian Sect's face finally changed. He wiped his mouth and spat out blood. His ghost energy again transformed into a black sky, rolling endlessly towards the golden staff.

Boom...

The golden staff shattered the black sky. The master of Huang Tian Sect, with blood on his mouth, fell from the sky and crashed into the ground. Alongside him was a golden hair that seemed to be set on fire, turning into ashes.

"It's over..." The other two masters showed fear. They looked at the master of Huang Tian Sect who was shaking but had risen from the ground.

The master of Huang Tian Sect's strength they knew. Now, he was severely wounded by a clone, which made them feel unbelievable.

"How strong must his original be?" They felt the monkey was a big enemy. Future attacks on the three heavens of the Buddha Sect would surely block their steps.

Far away, Dou Zhan Fo sat on a mountain peak. He spat out blood, obviously not feeling good because the clone had disappeared.

"How are you?" Dou Zhan Fo spoke as if talking to the void. His eyes were looking at the central Buddha statue.

"Go..." A solemn voice echoed in Dou Zhan Fo's ears, making his eyebrows slightly frown.

"Finally, I must help you. Otherwise..." Dou Zhan Fo shook his head gently. Finally, he made a decision and stretched out his hand to tear the void open. He appeared in a grand hall.

In the hall, a figure sat there. His body was filled with Buddha light to the extreme, lighting up the dark hall.

However, a stronger fluctuation constantly fell on that figure. Two energies seemed to be continuously opposing each other.

Dou Zhan Fo attacked, and his hand emitted infinite Buddha light into the figure's body. He fought against that figure with this energy.

As Dou Zhan Fo's clone was eliminated by the master of Huang Tian Sect, people's attention turned back to Lu Tian and Tai Ping Sect Master's battle.

After an hour of fighting, they exchanged blows. Lu Tian didn't gain any advantage and was constantly pushed back by Tai Ping Sect Master.

Boom... Lu Tian's body crashed into the ground again. Blood flowed from his mouth, and he stood up to return to the sky.

"I need to break through. Rushing Wind, Destruction Sword Array must also break through!" Lu Tian muttered in his heart. He felt he was still far from the true Supreme King peak, and the only way to improve was through his techniques.

"Destruction Sword Array!" Lu Tian waved his hand, and the Destruction Sword appeared in his hand. He shot out two sword beams, which were the first two forms of the Heaven Sword Three Forms.

After sending out two attacks, Lu Tian didn't stop. He danced with the Destruction Sword in the sky, leaving behind a series of afterimages.

One... Two... A series of world-destroying sword beams flew out with Lu Tian's continuous movements. They roamed across the sky.

Chapter 2721: The Red Lotus Reappears

Numerous sword beams roamed, each capable of killing a Supreme King. Sword energy spread everywhere. Lu Tian quickly sent out six hundred.

"It's not enough!" Lu Tian muttered in his heart, and he closed his eyes. He immersed himself in the Destruction Sword Array, recalling the ancient sword array he had felt in Shen Yin Village. That supreme figure danced with swords as if fighting against the heavens.

Six hundred and one... Seven hundred...

Lu Tian kept walking, each step producing a sword beam. As the number of sword beams increased and filled the sky, Tai Ping Sect Master's face became more and more serious. He watched the sword energy roaming above his head.

"They can't let it complete!" Tai Ping Sect Master muttered to himself. His hands moved quickly, and his long sword emitted ten thousand shades of black light. He held it with both hands and slashed towards Lu Tian.

The sword beam cut through the sky, a powerful pressure shaking the heavens. However, the entire sky seemed to be restrained by something. Although it kept breaking apart, it was quite stable.

Woo... Several hundred sword beams continuously swept towards the world-shaking sword beam. Lu Tian seemed surprised but continued to move his broken sword, sending out a series of sword beams.

Boom... Boom...

A series of explosions echoed. Each sword beam was shattered by Tai Ping Sect Master's world-shaking slash, making the people of Tianyuan Sect tremble.

"What should we do? Such a strong person, there are still three more!" Diao Dezhu grinned. Four Supreme Kings were enough to make them despair completely, even if Lu Tian was strong, he couldn't fight four alone.

"Don't worry. Maybe there's a chance. We've walked out of even more difficult situations before!" Nan Gong Yuqing spoke to the group.

"If Lu Tian is overwhelmed, let him escape. We can also escape one by one. Everyone prepare!"

"Only by living can we avenge!" Jiang Sixi transmitted to the group. At this moment, they still didn't dare to act recklessly because three Supreme Kings were watching Lu Tian. However, they felt a pressure surrounding them.

"What is the origin of this Tianyuan Sect? I heard it was established by a group from three thousand small worlds!" The masters thought.

They naturally knew about the three thousand small worlds, but in their years in Hell, they had never heard of a group from the three thousand small worlds developing to this extent.

"I'm curious about their world!" The master of Huang Tian Sect's face was slightly pale, and he muttered to himself.

As they thought, the sound of destruction finally stopped. Tai Ping Sect Master's sword beam was eventually shattered by a series of sword beams.

Lu Tian kept walking, and although dozens of sword beams were destroyed, the number increased to one thousand.

The pressure was increasing. In a moment, it grew another hundred sword beams, making Tai Ping Sect Master finally feel nervous. His aura rose, and his long sword emitted a series of roaring sounds.

"Tai Ping Dao Method!"

"Let him use the Tai Ping Dao Method! It seems this sword array has put a lot of pressure on him!" The master of Huang Tian Sect's eyes slightly narrowed. Since the three masters were not too close to the battlefield, the pressure from the Destruction Sword Array was not very strong for them.

"Ten Thousand Paths Alone!" As Tai Ping Sect Master's aura rose, Lu Tian finally sent out twelve hundred sword beams. The "Ten Thousand Paths Alone" was imbued in each sword beam, and Lu Tian opened his eyes.

"Go!" Lu Tian waved the Destruction Sword towards Tai Ping Sect Master. Destroying heaven and earth, people couldn't find other words to describe the sword array Lu Tian had launched. Twelve hundred sword beams radiated overwhelming power.

"Slash to determine Tai Ping!" Tai Ping Sect Master shouted and his sword beam expanded again, rushing towards the Destruction Sword Array.

"I don't believe it!" Lu Tian muttered to himself. He watched this world-shaking sword array, which had drained half of his cultivation. However, even though he was drained by half, it was worth it. He watched the sky-shattering sword array and the severed space. Tai Ping Sect Master's figure disappeared from people's sight.

"Terrifying! Qixue Sanren, indeed a strong person on par with Xing Tian. Three thousand six hundred sword beams! What kind of terror is that!" Lu Tian was shocked by the power of the sword array. He also knew this sword array, although powerful, couldn't eliminate Tai Ping Sect Master.

"Little Qi!" Lu Tian didn't care about Tai Ping Sect Master in the sword array. He quickly changed his hands, imprinting divine laws on his front and ten-color flames rising from his third eye. They spread everywhere, gathering in front of him.

"What is this mark?" Seeing the divine laws on Lu Tian's front, they were confused. They could feel that this mark was not simple.

A lotus-shaped mark finally appeared in people's sight. It was palm-sized, and the澎湃 ten-color flames were beginning to compress, pouring into this mark.

Woo... The mark emitted a series of moans. It seemed to be restrained and suppressed by this mark.

"World-Destroying Red Lotus!"

Lu Tian's technique was the exclusive method of Long Que. Lu Tian had always envied it, but Long Que never gave it to him.

But before, when he met the补天 stone (Supreme Heaven Stone), the Supreme Heaven Stone somehow obtained Long Que's World-Destroying Red Lotus and gave it to Lu Tian. This was also Lu Tian's last method.

It wasn't that the Destruction Sword Array was not strong. It was because even with Lu Tian's current strength, he couldn't fully unleash the power of three thousand six hundred swords. One was because his sword art level wasn't enough, and the other was because of his cultivation.

Time passed slowly. Under people's eyes, the power of the Destruction Sword Array gradually decreased and was shattered by a series of sword beams.

Boom... The last sword beam disappeared, and Tai Ping Sect Master's figure appeared in people's sight.

Tai Ping Sect Master was extremely disheveled. His robe seemed to be cut apart, exposing many wounds and blood dripping.

"Damn it!" Tai Ping Sect Master's face was extremely grim. He hadn't felt so disheveled for a long time, and his eyes showed anger, looking at Lu Tian.

But as soon as Tai Ping Sect Master lifted his gaze, his body unexpectedly shivered. His eyes were wide open.

In front of him was a ten-color fire lotus, slowly flying towards his direction. Tai Ping Sect Master finally felt a life-threatening crisis.

Lu Tian panted heavily, standing in the sky with his body swaying. The World-Destroying Red Lotus had almost drained all of Lu Tian's cultivation, and the flame mark on his third eye was also dim.

"Little Qi's fire, replacing the Red Lotus Fire, is still strong!" Lu Tian's eyes showed anticipation. He could also feel the power of the World-Destroying Red Lotus. His current state definitely couldn't withstand it.

Chapter 2722: Those Who Offend the Nine Regions Shall Die!

The ten-color fire lotus, although moving slowly, instantly appeared in front of Tai Ping Sect Master. This made Tai Ping Sect Master's heart tremble. He hadn't felt such a strong sense of crisis for a long time, and now it was restrained by this palm-sized beautiful lotus.

In the face of crisis, Tai Ping Sect Master also fought with all his might. His hands moved quickly, and a black hole appeared.

"Void Gate of the Heaven!" Tai Ping Sect Master shouted. The black hole contained overwhelming divine power, as if it could swallow everything. It rushed towards the fire lotus.

In an instant, the palm-sized fire lotus flew into the black hole and disappeared from people's sight. The sky also fell into silence.

"Is that it?" People looked at the black hole slowly healing, staring at each other. They hadn't expected that it was over.

Lu Tian's eyebrows slightly furrowed, looking at Tai Ping Sect Master. Tai Ping Sect Master's face was somewhat grim. His face quickly turned red, and his body had a slight tremor.

Boom...

Just as everyone thought the World-Destroying Red Lotus was destroyed by Tai Ping Sect Master, a thunderous explosion echoed throughout the world. The sky shattered and spread everywhere.

A series of overwhelming fire waves fell from the sky, violently impacting Tai Ping Sect Master's body. Tai Ping Sect Master spat out blood and was engulfed by the ten-color flames.

The entire sky became scorching, as if it were the end of the world. Everyone's eyes showed fear, watching the ten-color flames rushing in all directions.

Three masters slightly narrowed their eyes and raised their hands to form a barrier, protecting the Hell people. Zhang Chenglong and others also desperately formed barriers to protect the people of Tianyuan Sect.

The fire waves swept for an hour before finally calming down. The area around Tianyuan Sect was filled with charred remains, and smoke rose everywhere.

After the barriers disappeared, people looked around with fear at the land that had been burned three feet deep.

"This attack is really terrifying. I don't believe this Supreme King could withstand it!" Diao Dezhu shouted, searching for Tai Ping Sect Master and Lu Tian's figures.

Lu Tian still stood there. His body was in disarray, obviously the impact hadn't hurt him. It was just that using the World-Destroying Red Lotus had drained him too much, and his body swayed.

"Where is Tai Ping Sect Master?" Everyone started searching for Tai Ping Sect Master, a terrifying thought rising in their minds.

"Did he die?"

"Has a Supreme King fallen?" People were terrified. A Supreme King standing in the sky had never been heard of anyone dying.

Crack... Crack...

The charred ground emitted crackling sounds. If not carefully observed, it was hard to see that it was a human shape.

A black figure with smoke rising from its body stood up. The charred remains cracked, revealing a red body.

Tai Ping Sect Master!

Someone shouted and recognized Tai Ping Sect Master as the charred remains faded. However, at this moment, Tai Ping Sect Master no longer had his previous dignity. His whole body was red and looked like it had been roasted.

"Hey, what's up? You got me cooked! Ha ha!" Diao Dezhu and others laughed. Although Tianyuan Sect was at a disadvantage, they had given up on fighting back and wanted to humiliate the enemy.

"Look at him. He's completely burned up, does it hurt?" They pointed and laughed at Tai Ping Sect Master who was bare.

"Ah..." Tai Ping Sect Master roared, but his aura was somewhat weakened. He had been injured severely by that attack.

A ruler of the Ten Hell Kings, being forced to this situation by a young man. Tai Ping Sect Master was furious.

Tai Ping Sect Master quickly put on a piece of clothing but didn't attack Lu Tian. Instead, he spoke to the master of Huang Tian Sect and the other two: "It's your turn now!"

"Good!" The master of Huang Tian Sect nodded and didn't hesitate. He saw that Lu Tian was also at his limit now, and he could kill him with one hand.

The master of Huang Tian Sect took a step forward and stood at the front. His gaze turned to Lu Tian without any words, directly striking towards him with one hand.

The overwhelming power of the palm made heaven and earth change. It almost made Tianyuan Sect despair, and Lu Tian's eyes also showed bitterness.

"Go!" Lu Tian sighed. He pointed his finger, but no sound was heard, leaving people confused.

What surprised them was that after speaking, Lu Tian stood there and watched the hand covering the sky strike towards him.

"Is he giving up resistance?" The Hell people showed contempt, thinking Lu Tian was showing off.

Just as they were surprised, a red dot appeared and expanded. It collided with the black hand.

Boom...

The thunderous sound echoed, and the black hand was instantly shattered by a stone that had expanded to thousands of zhang. It didn't stop expanding and continued towards the master of Huang Tian Sect.

"Damn it! I was holding back, but it's just a Supreme King. Let me crush you!" A voice that didn't fit the situation echoed in the sky.

Thousands of zhang... Ten thousands of zhang...

In an instant, a stone spanning ten thousand zhang appeared with the power of heaven and earth in front of the master of Huang Tian Sect.

"What is this thing!"

"Break it!" The master of Huang Tian Sect shouted and pointed his finger, striking the stone with all his might.

The collision sound echoed. The master of Huang Tian Sect spat blood and showed shock, his body flying back. The stone spanning ten thousand zhang also flew back towards Lu Tian.

"Painful! I'm dying!" A voice of cursing echoed. The huge stone flew back to Lu Tian's front.

"Go again!" Lu Tian kicked the stone, and the stone that was constantly cursing pain flew back towards the master of Huang Tian Sect.

"Lu Tian, you're not human. I'm injured!" With the stone's cursing voice and people's amazement, the stone again appeared in front of the master of Huang Tian Sect.

"I don't believe it!" The master of Huang Tian Sect didn't give up. He struck with his hand, colliding with the stone. But the result was still him spitting blood.

"Go back!" Lu Tian spoke, and this time he didn't move. He just let the stone return on its own.

Lu Tian panted heavily, looking at the stone that was shouting. It kept pressing down on the master of Huang Tian Sect, making him spit blood.

"There are still two left. What to do?" Lu Tian's gaze turned to the other two people. Tai Ping Sect Master was temporarily very injured, and there were still the masters of Ku Shen Sect and Equality Sect who maintained their peak combat power.

"Let's finish it. We've spent enough time!" The master of Ku Shen Sect took a step forward and looked at Lu Tian, who was panting.

"Let me end your suffering!" The master of Ku Shen Sect spoke. His hands kept changing, and an invisible fluctuation enveloped Lu Tian.

"Dead!" Lu Tian sighed. His current state definitely couldn't withstand a peak master.

"Those who insult the Nine Regions shall die!" Just as Lu Tian was about to fight desperately, a cold voice echoed throughout heaven and earth. A world-shattering sword beam cut through the sky and instantly appeared in front of Lu Tian, colliding with the strange seal.

This voice made Lu Tian's eyes show joy. He looked at the two figures approaching from afar.

Chapter 2723: Turning Point

Boom...

The sword beam collided with the strange seal in front of Lu Tian, pushing his body back. But Lu Tian seemed not to feel it and looked at the two figures approaching the group.

White robe with a sword, radiating strong aura. Middle-aged appearance but with several strands of white hair in his long hair. His eyes were cold and stern, looking at the four Hell Sect Masters.

The other person wore a leather jacket-like item on his upper body, revealing two thick arms. His body was strong and his eyes were bright like copper bells. He looked at the people of Tianyuan Sect with a gaze.
