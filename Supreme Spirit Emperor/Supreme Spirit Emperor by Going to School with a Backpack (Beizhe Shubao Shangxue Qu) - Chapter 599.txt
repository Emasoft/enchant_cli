“Don’t be reckless!” Luo Tian’s heart clenched fiercely, hurriedly interrupting Fu Xingyue. He feared that his second maternal uncle would directly kill Jiang Yuwen, leaving them all to perish. The wrath of the Supreme Heaven Immortal spanned the entire celestial realm, even hell itself—few could withstand it.

The Supreme Heaven Immortal was a peer of the Fallen Heaven Immortal from the same era. Now, the Eternal Life Mountain among the Nine Celestial Peaks was dominant; even the Eternal Life Immortal dared not openly clash with the Supreme Heaven Immortal. Yet, the Supreme Heaven Immortal was known as the most enigmatic of all immortals, skilled in divination and star-gazing, capable of foreseeing fate.

Luo Tian hurried to Fu Xingyue’s side and seized Jiang Yuwen’s soul, then waved his hand, taking the man’s storage ring.

With a wave of his hand, Luo Tian cast Jiang Yuwen into the blood-soaked chaos. Jiang Yuwen revived once more.

“Haha! Luo Tian, you still dare not kill me!” Jiang Yuwen laughed wildly, his gaze scornful as he looked at Luo Tian.

“You’re getting old, aren’t you? Can’t even lift your sword anymore?” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang frowned, watching Luo Tian standing there. Knowing him well, they would have already slain this arrogant man long ago.

*Boom…* Luo Tian raised his hand and slashed a sword strike at Jiang Yuwen, sending him into a mist of blood. Death… rebirth… an endless cycle. Luo Tian struck repeatedly, pushing Jiang Yuwen deeper into the Heavenly Dao realm.

“Huff…” After slaying Jiang Yuwen several times, Luo Tian’s anger was finally vented. He eyed Jiang Yuwen with mockery.

“Go!” Luo Tian sneered, watching the stunned Jiang Yuwen, then transmitted a mental message to the Supreme Heaven Stone: “Follow him and steal his essence!”

Chapter 2268: The Heart of the World

“Leave it to me,” the Supreme Heaven Stone assured. No one noticed its presence except Luo Tian, who could sense its subtle movements.

“Thank you… thank you!” Jiang Yu now lacked his former arrogance, his cultivation had plummeted to the Heavenly Dao realm. Though he felt powerful in this starfield, compared to Luo Tian’s group, he was minuscule. Worse still, Jiang Yu felt that if he died again, it would be permanent.

Jiang Yu fled desperately into the distance, leaving Luo Tian and his companions standing beneath the stars.

*Boom boom boom…* The starlight beast disintegrated, forming countless figures, their faces weary from sustaining such a grand formation.

“Alright, everyone rest,” Fu Xingyang ordered. “Remember, do not chase those people.” He believed Luo Tian’s refusal to let them kill Jiang Yu Long and others must have had a reason.

“Yes!” Fu Xingyang’s authority was undeniable; no one dared defy him. They rose and flew toward their respective continents.

“Brother, let’s go—let’s talk at our place!” Fu Xingyue smiled, rising into the air and leading Luo Tian’s group toward the central continent.

Within a few heartbeats, they arrived at an opulent hall reminiscent of the Starlight Divine Clan’s palace. Luo Tian marveled at its grandeur.

“You still prefer such extravagance!” Luo Tian murmured, his companions also gazing in awe at the hall’s style—so different from their Supreme Heaven Mountain, resembling an imperial palace.

“People need to indulge, don’t they?” Fu Xingyue smiled, sitting at a table and lifting a wine cup.

“Years of hardship? You’ve only reached the peak of True Immortal?” Fu Xingyue chuckled, raising his cup to Luo Tian.

“Hardship…” Hearing Fu Xingyue’s words, Luo Tian and his companions felt a pang. Luo Tian’s cultivation speed was already remarkable in the celestial realm, but compared to Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang’s half-Immortal level, it was slow. This stirred a sense of imbalance in Luo Tian.

“Back then, the Immortal Path collapsed, and we drifted into this starfield. At first, it was terrible—highest cultivation was only the Sage Realm, and even wounded,” Fu Xingyang explained.

“So we had no purpose here, searching for opportunities. Surprisingly, we ascended to the Heavenly Dao Realm as if it were natural, making us almost believe we’d entered the celestial realm. But these people were too weak!”

They discovered this was a battlefield between two celestial realms.
“Resentment lingers among these people toward the Supreme Heaven Mountain and the sect that attacked it. Convincing them will be difficult, but none of this matters—we are their kings!” Fu Xingyue grinned.

Previously in the Nine Realms, Luo Tian had always been their superior. Now in the celestial realm, their cultivation surpassed his, lifting Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang’s spirits. Yet it didn’t harm their bond, for they were relatives.

“Ah, Jiang Brother, by all logic, we’ve already subdued this starfield’s people. Why can’t we leave?” Luo Tian nodded to Jiang Yuzhe, unable to voice certain things aloud—like the matter of Fu Xingxuan in hell. He could only tell them Fu Xingxuan was fine.

“I don’t know… perhaps we were too easy,” Jiang Yuzhe shook his head, unsure what his father was thinking.

“Don’t talk about other things. Luo Tian, this is three thousand small worlds, but there are treasures here! We entered a perilous place and obtained two pills, which gave us this power!” Fu Xingxuan spoke eagerly. If not for his close bond with Luo Tian, they wouldn’t have told him.

“A perilous place?” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed. A place that elevated two to half-Immortal—this must be no ordinary spot, perhaps a great opportunity.

“After resting for a day, I’ll take you there. I just came out of it!” Fu Xingyue said, not inviting Jiang Yuzhe.

“Still, whether you can enter depends on luck!” Fu Xingyue then glanced at Jiang Yuzhe, speaking softly.

*Boom…* As they spoke, a thunderous roar echoed in their ears, shaking the hall violently.

“What’s happening?”
“Did someone break in again?” Their faces darkened, rising into the air and tearing through the sky to emerge outside the hall.

“Roar…” As they exited their continent’s domain, a radiant glow rose in the west.

The light swept across the stars, illuminating the entire starfield. A wave of pressure surged, making them feel awe.

“Over there…”
“Damn, why did it awaken!” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingxuan’s faces darkened, staring at the pressure-laden glow.

“What’s happening?” Luo Tian asked, his expression grave. This starfield seemed changed; their trials had shifted—this was surely the Supreme Heaven Immortal’s doing.

“Whoever seizes the World Heart shall pass the trial!” A solemn voice echoed through heaven and earth.

“It’s father!” Jiang Yuzhe’s face shifted slightly, surprised the Supreme Heaven Immortal had spoken the trial’s purpose himself.

The Supreme Heaven Immortal had no choice; though this world seemed under Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang’s control, he had secretly observed. Initially, he intended for Jiang Yuzhe to compete against Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang, letting the victor claim the World Heart. Yet Luo Tian’s familiarity with them allowed Jiang Yuzhe to complete the trial swiftly, forcing the Supreme Heaven Immortal to alter his plan.

“What is the World Heart?” Luo Tian asked, puzzled by its significance.

“Legends say three thousand small worlds each孕育 a World Heart. Whoever controls it can fully master the world. But cultivating a World Heart is nearly impossible!”

“Controlling a World Heart transforms the small world into a World Treasure. A weapon forged from an entire world’s essence surpasses even top-tier immortal artifacts, a level beyond comparison. Our Supreme Heaven Mountain’s Supreme Heaven Sword is itself a World Treasure.”

“This is why many seek the three thousand small worlds—entering them makes one the strongest. If a world孕育s a World Heart, merging with it grants unparalleled power and weapons!” Jiang Yuzhe explained.

At the same time, the Supreme Heaven Immortal’s voice echoed in Jiang Yulong and others’ ears across the starfield.

“World Heart… this small world has孕育ed one! It must be Father’s special method—otherwise, such a treacherous item would never exist!” Jiang Yulong sat on a continent, speaking loudly with three companions.

Their eyes gleamed with excitement, but upon recalling the World Heart was for Jiang Yulong’s group, their excitement dimmed slightly. Yet the Supreme Heaven Immortal’s hand was generous; other opportunities would surely be great.

“Father truly invested heavily, even giving up the World Heart! We must compete!” A youth lay on a small boat drifting across the sea, smiling as he stood up and sent messages to his three companions.

“Jiang Yuzhe’s group will definitely go—what use is conquering these people?” Jiang Yuxi bathed in a gray pool, his face wild, his aura rising steadily.

“Clearly, this was our opportunity—why is there a World Heart?” Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingxuan’s faces darkened. They had gained much from the glowing spot but hadn’t gone all the way, missing the World Heart.

“It’s certain—World Heart is a world’s lifeblood. Without special methods, it wouldn’t be discovered. But the place where it lies is a perilous spot; even Immortal Kings must tread carefully!”

“Only someone like my father, reaching the peak of Immortal King, could subdue a World Heart and pass it on! This world’s World Heart was clearly taken by my father, then given to us to compete!” Jiang Yuzhe told Luo Tian’s group.

“This is the real battle. My other brothers will surely compete!” Jiang Yuzhe sighed softly. His brothers might not care for the position of Young Master, but they’d definitely covet the World Heart. Originally, it was Jiang Yulong, Jiang Yufeng, and him competing—but now six more had joined.

“Let’s go! What do we care? Their brothers are injured; let’s enter early, maybe grab it first. They’ve been here before, so they have experience. With our strength, we have a great advantage. If we still can’t get the World Heart, it’s no loss!” Luo Tian leapt into the air, gazing at the glowing spot. He thought of the Nine Realms, which also had perilous spots. After becoming the Epoch Lord, he hadn’t cared for those places. He suspected the Nine Realms might also孕育ed a World Heart.

Chapter 2269: The Demon Cavern

In the black starfield, waves of energy constantly spread. Invisible ripples echoed like a heartbeat, strange vibrations making Luo Tian’s group gape in horror.

Outside the yellow glow stood six figures—Luo Tian and his companions, gazing at a dark hole within the yellow glow.

“This is it! We obtained two pills and soaked in a pool here, which elevated us to half-Immortal!” Fu Xingyue told Luo Tian’s group.

“Still, this barrier was unobtrusive in the black hole!” Fu Xingyue told Luo Tian. He had planned to lead Luo Tian into this cave to enhance their strength, but now everyone knew.

“Let’s go! We arrived early—lead the way and see how to enter!” Luo Tian shrugged, gazing at the yellow barrier.

“Little Brother Nine, you came early!” As they discussed, four figures emerged from the starfield, smiling.

A youth held a jade fan, his aura exuding an air of cleanliness. His smile was warm and elegant, giving a sense of refinement.

Unlike the youth’s elegance, the three behind him radiated icy coldness. One of them Luo Tian recognized—Bai Family’s Heir, Bai Tian.

Bai Tian looked at Luo Tian and nodded. He knew they were on opposing sides now, possibly clashing later. Yet in the Supreme Heaven City, their relationship wasn’t bad—Bai Tian had even warned Luo Tian beforehand.

“The Supreme Heaven City truly hones one!” Luo Tian mused, noting Bai Tian’s iron-forged aura.

Another he had met before but forgotten his name. Most striking was the half-Immortal elder, whose cold eyes suggested no good intentions. Even with three half-Immortals on their side, the elder showed no fear.

“Sixth Brother!” Jiang Yuzhe bowed respectfully to the youth, showing deference. Clearly, in the Supreme Heaven Mountain, this sixth brother had treated Jiang Yuzhe kindly.

“Little Nine, we’re all brothers—this time, I’ll compete too! Don’t let it harm our bond!” The youth spoke.

“Jiang Yuhong, the sixth son of the Supreme Heaven Immortal. His strength is deep and unknowable, but it’s all rumor. He’s gentle, dislikes conflict, yet loves poetry!” Luo Tian overheard Jiang Yuzhe and the youth’s conversation, gathering this information. He relayed their details to Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingxuan.

“Sixth Brother, I’ll obey!” Jiang Yuzhe replied respectfully.

“But why? We won’t let you!” Fu Xingyue muttered, his lack of friendship with them making him eager to compete.

The Ancient Kings were all ruthless; compromise was only possible if one’s strength overpowered them. Yet now, none of the Supreme Heaven Immortal’s nine sons matched Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue. If combined with Luo Tian, Fu Xingyang was confident he could sweep aside these so-called Supreme Heaven Kings’ sons.

“You’re just a local!” The elder behind Jiang Yuhong barked, disdain evident in his voice.

“You’re just a local! I could beat ten of you!” The elder sneered, provokingly.

“Do you think you’re worth it? Beat me! Let’s see your skills!” Fu Xingyue sneered, his golden divine spear radiating gold light.

“Silence!” Luo Tian and Jiang Yuhong both barked, silencing Fu Xingyue and the elder. Yet they glared at each other fiercely.

“Sixth Brother, let’s go in!” Jiang Yuzhe sighed, his unease with Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang evident.

“Old Six, Old Nine, you came quickly!” As they spoke, twelve figures emerged from the starfield’s four corners. They split into three groups, smiling with strong auras.

“Supreme Heaven Immortal’s fifth son, Jiang Yuxian; seventh son, Jiang Yutian; eighth son, Jiang Yuping!” Luo Tian observed them, then mentally introduced them to Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingxuan.

Five groups faced each other, exchanging glances. Upon seeing Jiang Yuzhe’s group, their brows furrowed—Jiang Yuzhe’s side was clearly stronger with two half-Immortals.

“Why didn’t the eldest, second, or third sons come? They should have arrived earlier!” Jiang Yuxian murmured, puzzled.

“They were killed by Little Nine; they’re currently recovering!” Jiang Yuping replied, gazing at Jiang Yuzhe’s group.

“Little Nine truly is Little Nine! No wonder Father favors you so!” The brothers sighed, not overly concerned. They didn’t care who became Young Master; they only sought the World Heart.

Luo Tian observed Jiang Yuzhe’s brothers, trying to discern who held hostility toward him. All appeared harmonious on the surface, but their true intentions were unknown. These people’s allies would surely be formidable; if clashed, they might resort to lethal force. Some had minor grudges with Luo Tian, like Qin Hewei.

“Let’s go! Everyone is brothers—let’s compete fairly!” Jiang Yuhong smiled, addressing his brothers and stepping toward the golden barrier.

Seeing Jiang Yuhong move, others followed, their steps strange as they rushed into the golden barrier. In an instant, all reached the black hole’s entrance. A gust of cold wind howled from within, sending chills down their spines.

“This is the Demon Cavern! Its contents seem corrupted by demons. We don’t know how deep it goes—we only reached a pool and couldn’t proceed, as demons lurked beyond.” Fu Xingyue mentally informed Luo Tian.

“If my guess is right, this must be the sect that attacked our Supreme Heaven Mountain—the Demon Sect!”

“The Demon Sect was renowned in the Central Three Realms, its disciples all demon cultivators, cruel and savage. The sect grew stronger until it targeted our Supreme Heaven Mountain. After a fierce battle, the Demon Sect was destroyed, and we too suffered losses. Yet this battle solidified our Supreme Heaven Mountain’s reputation—no one dares challenge us now!” Jiang Yuzhe explained.

Luo Tian’s expression darkened; daring to attack the Supreme Heaven Mountain required courage, and this battle had cost them dearly. It proved the Demon Sect’s strength.

“Let’s go!” As he spoke, they rushed into the black vortex. Waves of energy echoed like passing through a spatial barrier, making Luo Tian sigh in relief—this wasn’t teleportation.

Yet as he landed, Jiang Yuzhe’s group vanished, his eyes darkening. The world turned black, giving him the feeling of re-entering hell.

But hell felt eerie; this place felt cold and mad.

A black world, gusts of wind battering him, the space solid. A forest of black trees appeared before his eyes.

*Boom…*
*Boom…* The heavy sound echoed, like a heartbeat. Luo Tian could clearly feel the ground’s tremors.

“Is this the World Heart’s beat?” Luo Tian frowned, stepping toward the forest—no path but black trees ahead.

As he pondered, he entered the forest, his spiritual sense scanning its movements.

*Hiss…* As his spiritual sense spread or he stepped into the forest, waves of energy surged. No need to explore; a black ocean rushed toward him.

Numerous black spiders swarmed toward Luo Tian, making him gasp in shock.

As he was stunned, a black cloud descended, heavy pressure darkening his face.

“Didn’t they say the first trial was a maze?” Luo Tian cursed, staring at the descending black cloud. He punched it.

What was that? It wasn’t a cloud—it was a massive black spider, its aura making Luo Tian wary.

Black eyes, a black body, and scales on its belly—its dark mouth exuded an ominous glow. Luo Tian’s lips twitched.

He punched, his black-aura fist colliding with the massive body, producing a dull sound.

*Boom…* Next moment, Luo Tian felt as if crushed by a mountain, his legs sinking into the ground, his face pale.

*Crack…* The massive spider’s mouth bit toward Luo Tian, spitting out black mist. Its sharp jaws gnawed at his arm, making him roar.

*Shua shua…* Meanwhile, the black spiders surrounded Luo Tian, crawling toward him.

“Get out of here…” Luo Tian growled, his scalp tingling as he unleashed a surge of True Immortal power, creating a gust that slammed the spiders.

But the spiders clung like leeches, biting his body relentlessly.

Chapter 2270: The Demon Spider

Luo Tian roared, his body unbreakable, but his arm still lost a chunk of flesh. His body constantly felt numbness; the small spiders hadn’t pierced his physical defense, yet black mist spread across him.

At this point, Luo Tian’s body was obscured by layers of spiders; the apparent spider king stood nearby, its demon-infused eyes watching him.

*Hiss…* Nine-colored flames surged from Luo Tian, burning through the void and instantly turning the surrounding spiders to ash.

The flames spread outward, transforming a ten-zhang radius into a nine-colored world. Luo Tian panted heavily, gazing at the isolated spider.

Numerous black spiders rushed toward him, but the nine-colored flames formed a barrier, instantly killing countless spiders. Yet they seemed determined to kill Luo Tian, sacrificing themselves endlessly.

Black mist churned; the spiders’ deaths created vast black mist, making Luo Tian’s eyes flicker with interest.

“These are concentrated True Immortal energy—though tainted by demon power, they’ve become demon mist. If absorbed, they could boost my cultivation!” Luo Tian mused, watching the black mist with regret.

He dared not easily refine these demon mist; their density was too heavy. A little refinement might be fine, but refining a lot could cause issues—perhaps even turning him into a demon.

“I’ll refine just a little, test it!” Yet after that, Luo Tian couldn’t resist the temptation to try.

He had arrived in the Upper Three Realms, feeling stimulated—everyone was at True Immortal peak except him.

And Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue had reached half-Immortal; he was only True Immortal late-stage. He felt anxious, fearing falling behind.

“First, I need to deal with this big spider!” Luo Tian eyed the spider king, who hadn’t dared approach.

“What is this spider?” Luo Tian observed it, his hands moving as he unleashed the Infernal Ghost Claws. Black ghost claws shot toward the spider king.

*Wum…* The spider king let out a low hum, spitting out a black web that rushed toward the Infernal Ghost Claws.

*Boom boom…* The dark sky cracked, and the Infernal Ghost Claws were blocked by the massive web.

The spider king moved again, spitting out a gust of wind that carried thick demon mist toward Luo Tian.

“Indeed tainted by demon mist—its mind is impaired!” Luo Tian sneered, fire overcoming wind. There was a saying: fire borrows wind’s power. This spider king using wind to counter his Seven Flames was clearly futile.

The earth trembled, black trees uprooted and destroyed by the storm. Luo Tian sneered as the terrifying black wind approached him.

*Boom…* As expected, fire borrowed wind’s power—nine-colored flames surged ten feet higher, annihilating many spiders and shrouding the sky in demon mist.

Yet Luo Tian’s expression changed, for the storm had begun to push the nine-colored flames away.

“Damn!” Luo Tian cursed, surprised at his mistake. Though fire borrows wind’s power, there’s another saying: extremes reverse. Though they are opposites, different quantities could change the outcome.

The spider king’s storm was such—though it couldn’t destroy the nine-colored flames, it could amplify their power. Yet it moved the flames away.

“Return!” Luo Tian felt his flames dwindling, shouting to bring them back. But the storm was too strong, quickly scattering his flames. The wind swept over him, creating wounds.

Before Luo Tian could escape the storm, the spider king soared into the air, a black spider descending to engulf him. Countless spiders rushed toward him.

In an instant, the spiders wrapped around Luo Tian’s body, their cold, demon-infused bodies eroding him.

*Boom…* The spider king’s massive body crashed down, pressing on Luo Tian’s body.

“Break…!” Luo Tian roared, trying to break free from the cold spiders—but he found his strength couldn’t tear them apart.

*Wum…* Dragon’s Abyss Sword emitted a dark glow, flying out of its red sheath to sever the spiders.

Flames erupted, Luo Tian wielding Dragon’s Abyss Sword and slicing the spider king’s belly, removing scales and leaving a blood trail.

A piercing sound echoed; the spider king’s body recoiled, its sharp jaws trembling from extreme pain.

Nine-colored flames surged again, filling the area around Luo Tian. He gazed at the spider king, green liquid oozing from its belly.

“Now it’s my turn!” Luo Tian sneered, feeling the spider king was no more than a few attack methods.

He moved swiftly, vanishing from his spot—spiders rushing past him but many burned to ash by his flames.

*Wum…* The spider king opened its mouth again, sending another gust of wind toward Luo Tian’s location.

The wind blew, instantly distorting Luo Tian’s body like a water reflection, vanishing.

“I’m here, big guy!” A figure descended from the sky, Dragon’s Abyss Sword radiating terrifying divine power, stabbing toward the spider.

Nine-colored flames enveloped Luo Tian, making him appear like a war god. He arrived instantly atop the spider king’s body, stabbing its scaled belly.

*Plop…* Dragon’s Abyss Sword fully revealed its sharpness; Luo Tian felt a slight resistance, and the black sword pierced the spider king’s belly.

A piercing sound echoed; the spider king’s massive body trembled violently, green liquid oozing from where the sword entered.

“Die!” Luo Tian twisted his wrist, gripping the sword with both hands, veins bulging as he slashed Dragon’s Abyss Sword.

*Plop plop plop…* Dragon’s Abyss Sword cut through the spider king’s belly, releasing a foul odor. Green, disgusting droplets scattered across the ground, causing the surrounding black forest to wither instantly.

The massive body began violent convulsions, rushing toward Luo Tian, clearly enraged.

“Still alive?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, watching the spider king rushing toward him. He retreated into the sky, his hands flashing with divine light—Shooting Sun Bow and Destroying God Arrows appeared in his grasp.

“Burst…” Divine light flowed; the Destroying God Arrow became a streak of light, shooting toward the spider king rolling and flying upward. This arrow was an explosion.

The Destroying God Arrow pierced the spider king, embedding into the ground. The spider king’s body exploded mid-air, scattering into a black mist of blood from the sky.

Luo Tian waved his hands, nine-colored flames sweeping to refine the mist. He sighed in relief, gazing at the refined mist. His brows furrowed slightly.

“What is this?” Luo Tian murmured, rushing toward a descending streak of light. In an instant, he stood before the dark glow, grabbing it with his hand.

Cold to the touch, a black crystal appeared in his palm—Luo Tian gasped: “Inner Dantian!”

“This is the spider king’s entire cultivation! If consumed, it would surely elevate my cultivation by ten percent, bringing me closer to True Immortal peak!” Luo Tian mused, his eyes gleaming with excitement. Ten percent of cultivation—given his current speed, it would take years to achieve.

He had entered True Immortal late-stage for some time, but reaching True Immortal peak was like a dream.

“Yet I wonder if refining this Inner Dantian will cause issues!” Luo Tian mused, then sat cross-legged on the ground, nine-colored flames sweeping to refine the countless spiders.

Black mist coiled above his head; Luo Tian’s hands formed a seal, circulating the technique. The sky’s black mist was absorbed slightly.

Cold demon mist roamed his body, circulating through a cycle before becoming True Immortal power, absorbed by the small figure in his dantian—half-black, half-gold.

“Slightly increased cultivation, but some demon mist remains in my meridians. If I’m careful, it should be fine!” Luo Tian mused, beginning to absorb the demon mist from the spiders refined by nine-colored flames.

Meanwhile, others faced similar issues but hadn’t resolved them as quickly as Luo Tian.

On another front, Jiang Yulong appeared outside the Demon Cavern, his face dark as he cursed: “Damn, they’ve all entered!”

“Once you enter, notify me if you meet Luo Tian. We’ll ambush him together!” Jiang Yulong ordered his three companions.

“Big Brother, add us too!” As Jiang Yulong spoke, Jiang Yufeng arrived with her group, her face fierce.

Chapter 2271: Yin Wuyue

Above the black sky, demon mist swirled around Luo Tian, his body radiating immense power. A vortex of demon mist formed above him, sweeping toward him.

The surrounding spiders no longer rushed at Luo Tian; though demonized and mindless, they avoided danger. Soon, they retreated into the forest’s depths, vanishing from Luo Tian’s surroundings.

Yet Luo Tian continued to absorb demon mist, refining it while some remained in his meridians.

Time passed slowly; two hours had elapsed. Luo Tian opened his eyes, his gaze flickering with demon patterns. His usual ghostly aura was now colder, like a world-destroying demon lord, exuding an icy, merciless aura.

“Truly a treasure! But few can withstand it!” Luo Tian chuckled. His cultivation had indeed grown, but he felt cold all over; the residual demon mist in his meridians eroded him constantly, affecting his mind like a reborn inner demon.

Luo Tian rose slowly, knowing he couldn’t absorb more—his endurance had allowed this much. If he continued, he feared he’d lose control; though his cultivation was good, falling into the demon path and becoming a demon creature would be disastrous.

He flipped his hand, storing the spider king’s Inner Dantian—truly a treasure. He hadn’t used it yet; few beasts could form an Inner Dantian. If the demon mist was purified, it would be pure cultivation.

“Let’s check deeper!” Luo Tian gazed at the ruined forest, leaping into the air toward its depths.

*Roar…* Time passed; Luo Tian had flown for half an hour when a roar echoed again. A black demon tiger appeared in his vision, its body radiating immense aura.

“Another Inner Dantian?” Luo Tian smiled, drawing Dragon’s Abyss Sword and rushing toward the demon tiger.
