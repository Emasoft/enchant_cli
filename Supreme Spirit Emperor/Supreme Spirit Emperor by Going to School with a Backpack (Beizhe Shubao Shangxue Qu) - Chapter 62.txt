“Father…” Qi Tianchu’s face showed confusion as he heard Qi Derong retreat. Clearly, they had the advantage now; he couldn’t fathom why his father would back down.

“Rumors spread like wildfire… No one expected the seventh-ranked Qi Derong in Beiming City to retreat before a young man at the ninth stage of Body Refinement.”

“This youth—what is he? Could he be a disciple from a sect? Even if he were, in Beichang County, such a thing wouldn’t mean much!” People murmured loudly.

Wu Di’s face was filled with gratitude as he gazed at Luo Tian, speechless for a moment, unsure how to speak.

Luo Tian saw Qi Derong and his son leave. His lips curled slightly, exhaling a soft sigh: “Find a place to stay—don’t end up sleeping on the streets at night!”

After speaking, Luo Tian strode toward the crowd’s edge, leaving Zhou Tianxiong’s corpse on the ground.

The几名巡逻 members at the ninth stage of Body Refinement dared not confront Luo Tian. After all, this was someone who had even dared to challenge Qi Derong. To arrest him? That would be inviting death.

……

“Father, why did you let that youth go? If we two join forces, he wouldn’t stand a chance!” Qi Tianchu asked on the way home, his voice laced with confusion.

“that youth is no ordinary man. I felt a sense of danger from him, especially when he held that scale fragment. He must be a disciple training from a major sect. It’s better to avoid trouble if we can,” Qi Derong said, his face still grave.

“Then let him be so arrogant?” Qi Tianchu’s face bore resentment. In Beiming City, who else dared to scold him like that?

“Arrogant? The most important thing now is the auction. Once we secure the elixirs your grandfather needs, once he reaches the Soul-Refining realm, even if this youth has a sect’s backing, in Beichang County, he’ll have to kneel before me!” Qi Derong’s face twisted into a grimace. It had been ages since anyone had dared to scold him.

That night, Luo Tian and Wu Di found lodging in an inn. The news of Luo Tian’s clash with the Zhou family and his dismissal of the Qi family spread through Beiming City. Everyone now knew a young man had arrived—Wu Di’s ally, the one who had avenged his clan.

Luo Tian sat cross-legged on his bed. Though the spiritual energy here was thin, it wasn’t nonexistent. He resumed his cultivation as he always did.

Just a minute after closing his eyes, knocking echoed at the door. A cheerful voice called out: “Brother, are you in? I have something to discuss!”

Luo Tian opened his eyes, frowning slightly. His spiritual sense extended outward and saw a burly young man standing outside the door, his face carrying a hint of nervousness.

Luo Tian didn’t know this man at all. He opened the door and scrutinized the youth, confirming he had never seen him before. “Who are you?” he asked.

“Brother, I am Huang Baidang. I also reside in Beiming City. I wish to befriend you!” Huang Baidang smiled.

“Huang Family?” Luo Tian’s brow furrowed, his expression puzzled. He recalled Wu Di’s introduction of Beiming City’s factions. The Huang Family ranked third among them.

Though the Qi family was seventh in Beiming City, compared to the top three families, it was like heaven and earth. Not only were their patriarchs inferior, but the top three families all possessed Soul-Refining masters.

These rankings were only external. In truth, most long-term residents of Beiming City knew these three families’ strengths were nearly equal.

“Indeed, I am from the Huang Family. Brother, may I know your name and where you reside? It’s my first time seeing such a young man with such strength!” Huang Baidang smiled warmly.

“I am Luo Tian, a lone cultivator. I wander from place to place,” Luo Tian replied. On the Tianyuan Continent, countless people bore the same name. Thus, Luo Tian had no fear of his name spreading. His appearance had been altered with pills upon entering Beiming City, so he was unrecognizable.

“Ah, Brother Luo. I wonder why you’ve come to Beichang Domain? Would you consider joining my Huang Family as a guest? Naturally, I won’t demand your freedom. I’ll also provide resources for your cultivation!” Huang Baidang, without the airs of a major family’s disciple, smiled kindly.

Hearing Huang Baidang’s words, Luo Tian hesitated before finally shaking his head. “Brother Huang, I must confess—I won’t stay long in Beiming City. Once the Qi family’s auction is over, I’ll leave this place. Thus, I must decline your offer.”

Chapter 304: The Huang Family

Chapter 304: The Huang Family

“No problem. Even so, I hope our Huang Family can be friends with Brother Luo, not enemies!” Huang Baidang smiled.

“Rest assured. If the Huang Family doesn’t trouble me, I won’t provoke them. But if someone dares to challenge me, then don’t say I didn’t respect Brother Huang!”

Luo Tian smiled lightly.

“Then I’ll take my leave. I assume you’re interested in the Qi family’s auction. Take this as a gift—otherwise, you wouldn’t even enter the auction hall. Consider it a token of friendship. I hope Brother Luo will reconsider my offer,” Huang Baidang said, not wishing to linger.

“By the way, today in the city, I saw Brother Luo’s spear technique—it was quite remarkable. May I ask what it is called?” Huang Baidang asked, his face showing curiosity.

“Uh…” Luo Tian was caught off guard by Huang Baidang’s question, unsure why the man was so interested in his spear technique.

“Don’t misunderstand, Brother Luo. We Huang Family all use spears. I felt a familiarity in your technique, so I was curious!” Huang Baidang quickly explained to avoid misunderstanding.

“My spear technique was taught by an elder on his deathbed. I hope his final art won’t be lost,” Luo Tian said.

“Oh, well, I hope to have the chance to spar with Brother Luo on this technique some day!” Huang Baidang bowed, a confident expression on his face.

“Ah… I won’t see you off,” Luo Tian smiled, standing at the door to watch Huang Baidang leave.

Luo Tian now held a black token. He had learned from the tea house attendant that to enter the Qi family’s auction, one needed a token. There were four colors—green, white, black, and gold—each corresponding to different status and seating arrangements.

“Just when I was worrying about where to get this token, someone just handed it to me!” Luo Tian weighed the black token in his hand and closed the door, returning to cultivation.

Time passed swiftly. Three days slipped by unnoticed. During these three days, Luo Tian remained in the inn without stepping out. Wu Di and he were curious why the Qi family hadn’t troubled them, as they had been unusually quiet.

Though Luo Tian knew this could be the calm before a storm, he wasn’t afraid. He had already planned to leave after the auction and seek out other sects in different cities. Though these sects were said to be hidden, Luo Tian knew they weren’t entirely secluded. There must be disciples wandering outside; it was impossible for them to vanish completely. Once he found one sect, he could find others.

Adjusting his clothes, Wu Di had already been waiting outside the door, his face showing respect. He knew today was the auction’s day. Luo Tian had stayed here for this reason.

Walking along Beiming City’s wide streets, though Luo Tian had made a big name two days ago, such news was quickly overshadowed by other rumors. Plus, they were unobtrusive to begin with; no one noticed them.

The auction wasn’t far from Luo Tian’s inn. They only walked half an hour before arriving.

The auction hall wasn’t large, not much bigger than the one Luo Tian had attended in Xuantian City. Participants numbered only a few hundred, murmuring among themselves around the central platform.

Only those with Qi family tokens could enter. Luo Tian’s black token earned him immediate attention from the staff, who seated him in a spacious and front position. If there had been private rooms, he would have surely received one.

Luo Tian sat calmly on his chair. His powerful spiritual sense extended outward, scanning for notable figures in Beichang County. Soon, he nodded in approval—these hundreds of people were all at least ninth-stage Body Refinement. If united, this force could rival a second-rate sect in the northern region.

As Luo Tian had guessed, those attending the auction were notable figures in Beichang County. They were confident they could take items out of Beiming City. After all, this was Beichang County; people were certain that many had already been lying in wait at the city gates, waiting for someone to exit.

“Haha, kid, I didn’t expect you’d dare come to my Qi family’s auction!” Qi Tianchu’s voice echoed from afar, his face filled with killing intent.

“What? I’m here to spend money. Doesn’t your family profit?” Luo Tian’s face remained cold, his voice sharp.

“Actually, you’ll end up giving your money to us anyway. It’s just a matter of time!” Qi Tianchu said, his face showing coldness.

“Elder Second Brother, you’re so busy. Do you have time to chat here?” A deep voice came from behind Qi Tianchu, carrying a hint of annoyance. His aura made people instinctively clear a path.

“Elder Brother, let me introduce you to the youth who killed Zhou Tianxiong!” Qi Tianchu’s face showed amusement.

“What? He’s the kid?” The man looked surprised, his eyes filled with excitement as if he had forgotten it was an auction.

His figure resembled a mountain, exuding immense pressure. His body glowed with earthy yellow as he punched forward.

When Luo Tian saw the man’s expression, a sense of familiarity stirred within him. As the man’s eyes grew more fervent, Luo Tian suddenly realized—this was the same look Wind Qianyu had given him. Yet this youth’s wild enthusiasm surpassed even Wind Qianyu’s.

Luo Tian didn’t dare to delay. Golden spiritual energy flowed over his fists as he met the young man’s heavy punch.

The sound of collision echoed through the already noisy auction hall, causing people to frown in confusion. Who dared to fight here at the Qi family’s auction?

Turning around, people gasped in shock. Two cracks spread beneath the two youths.

“Is this Qi family’s eldest son, Qi Tianbao? Why is he fighting with a young man who seems unfamiliar?” People murmured in confusion.

“You’re strong! I’ll fight you again some day!” Qi Tianbao smiled warmly, leading Qi Tianchu out of the crowd. Clearly, fighting here was inappropriate.

Chapter 305: The Auction Begins

Chapter 305: The Auction Begins

Luo Tian watched Qi Tianbao and Qi Tianchu leave, his face thoughtful. Honestly, he could sense that Qi Tianbao had no real hostility—just a desire to test his strength. It was the pure devotion to martial arts.

If Luo Tian had no grudge with the Qi family, he would have wanted to befriend such a person. But now, they stood on opposite sides.

“Who is this youth?” People murmured around.

“He’s the young man who killed the Zhou family!” Someone recognized Luo Tian, his face filled with disbelief. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to dare attend the Qi family’s auction.

But soon, no one paid attention to Luo Tian anymore. A group of people entered from the main door, drawing everyone’s gaze.

“Is that the top-ranked Han family patriarch? Is that his son, Han Xu?” People gasped.

“Not only them. The top three families in Beiming City have arrived! Is that Zhao family patriarch Zhao Hongyi and his son Zhao Yuanming? And Huang family patriarch Huang Tianrui with his son Huang Baidang?” People chattered loudly, their eyes filled with fear.

Indeed, it was fear. These three families had achieved their current status through countless people’s blood.

Luo Tian looked at the three families, his gaze falling on Huang Baidang. A realization dawned—Huang Baidang’s status in the Huang family must be high, otherwise he wouldn’t have given Luo Tian a black token. His guess was confirmed.

“Late-stage Bone Refinement?” Luo Tian’s face showed concern. Even if he broke his seal, he could barely fight this level. But definitely, it would cost him. In Beichang County, if you were injured, others wouldn’t miss the chance to finish you off.

Qi family’s three sons personally greeted these three families. Others were also attended by their respective patriarchs.

At this moment, Luo Tian finally saw the third son of the Qi family. He was a few years older than himself, his face carrying a gentle smile—his mouth closed, but he seemed to be smiling constantly.

Guiding the three patriarchs to the front, as their figures passed Luo Tian’s spot, Huang Baidang winked at him. His spiritual sense imprinted a message into Luo Tian’s mind: “Brother Luo, my father wants to meet you after the auction. Don’t worry—there’s no ill intent!”

Luo Tian furrowed his brow, puzzled by the Huang family’s ambiguous attitude. Though he was strong, he hadn’t reached a level where even Soul-Refining families needed to fear him.

Then, Luo Tian thought Huang Baidang was a decent person. He nodded slightly and whispered with his spiritual sense: “Agreed.”

Not long after, Qi Derong emerged from behind the platform, smiling and talking at length before finally getting to the auction’s main event.

The items up for sale were indeed fine, but Luo Tian found them unimpressive. He only bought two rare herbs and didn’t bid again. He wanted to see what the grade-level martial art was like. His wealth had surpassed people’s imagination after the cave space incident. He could afford a grade-level martial art.

Even so, he drew several greedy glances. Spiritual markers kept landing on him, but Luo Tian didn’t care much.

“Next item: a metal material called Seven-Defiance Flame Iron! When added to weapons, it allows them to channel fire-element spiritual energy, enhancing their fire-element martial arts by nearly double. Alternatively, you can forge this material into a treasure, yielding even better results,” Qi Derong smiled, looking at those with fire-element constitutions.

“Hum…” As Qi Derong took the Flame Iron from his storage ring, Luo Tian’s Cracking Heaven Spear suddenly showed intense longing within his storage ring.

This feeling was familiar. Earlier in the Great An Forest, when Luo Tian had advanced, his spear had shown similar emotions upon seeing that crimson metal.

“Take it!” Luo Tian resolved in his heart. Not only was the spear’s evolution strong, but he had been with it for so long. He needed to buy this Flame Iron. He wasn’t short on money now.

“Ten million spiritual stones!” Almost immediately after Qi Derong’s words, someone spoke up. A gruff voice echoed through the auction hall. The bidder was an old man with early-stage Bone Refinement, but his fierce gaze made people not consider him ordinary.

His bid caused the crowd to frown. For a moment, no one dared to speak up. Even among the other families besides the top three, they whispered among themselves.

Qi Derong sighed inwardly. This situation was rare, but this man was well-known in Beichang County as a rogue cultivator. Though he was alone without a family, his lack of ranking made him unimportant.

Qi Derong’s face showed bitterness. He was about to hammer the price when Luo Tian calmly spoke.

“Fifteen million spiritual stones!” Luo Tian’s calm voice caused the auction hall to fall silent for a moment. Eyes turned toward him, especially the top families who showed curiosity.

“Hand over one hundred and fifty million spiritual stones, and I’ll leave this matter alone!” The old man’s eyes flashed red as he coldly spoke. He had seen Luo Tian fight Qi Tianbao, and though they were dueling, it was a mutual test. If he hadn’t known Luo Tian’s relationship with the Qi family, he wouldn’t have let him go. Daring to challenge him meant death.

Luo Tian heard the old man’s words and smiled.

“Sixteen million spiritual stones!” After smiling, Luo Tian calmly looked at Qi Derong and spoke again.

This price caused the auction attendees to gasp. Their gazes at Luo Tian were filled with disbelief. The old man’s eyes flashed a hint of killing intent.

“Don’t take it personally, two hundred million!”

“Two hundred and ten million!” Luo Tian’s face remained calm as he stared at the old man.

“Interesting. In Beichang County, besides the top three families, who else dares to challenge me? I’ll spend one million spiritual stones!” The old man was clearly enraged, his eyes fixed on Luo Tian with a clear threat.

Chapter 306: Acquiring the Flame Iron

Chapter 306: Acquiring the Flame Iron

“One million spiritual stones!” People gasped at the old man’s price.

Beichang County was impoverished. Even a Body Refinement cultivator could barely afford one hundred million spiritual stones, and that was if they were doing well. Those who did poorly at the ninth stage of Body Refinement couldn’t even afford one hundred million.

Though the old man was a top contender in Bone Refinement, one million spiritual stones made him wince. But he had no choice; his cultivation method required pure yang energy to neutralize the evil qi within him, or he would go mad.

Luo Tian saw the old man’s crimson eyes—like a messenger from hell, staring at him. He smiled lightly: “One million one hundred thousand!”

“Gasps…” Luo Tian’s calm voice caused even more murmurs. The auction hall had nearly a hundred Bone Refinement masters. Their gazes at Luo Tian were filled with greed—one million one hundred thousand was enough for people to take a risk.

Qi Derong was also shocked. He couldn’t fathom why Luo Tian was so wealthy, throwing out one million one hundred thousand without hesitation. He secretly rejoiced; he had thought the Flame Iron was a loss, but now a foolish kid had raised the price to one million one hundred thousand—higher than its value.

“This kid must be a disciple from a major sect! Otherwise, he wouldn’t have so many spiritual stones!” A square-faced middle-aged man looked at Luo Tian with surprise. He sat in the front row, being Han family patriarch Han Lihui.

Huang and Zhao families’ patriarchs also nodded in agreement. Hearing their fathers’ confirmation, the two young men behind them showed interest, gazing at Luo Tian sitting calmly.

“Kid! You’re seeking death! One million five hundred thousand!” The old man’s face twisted with ferocity, raising his price again.

“Sixteen million one hundred thousand!” Luo Tian remained calm and continued bidding. His mind thought: “Let’s play money with me? Even the three families couldn’t match my wealth. I’ll crush you with money today!”

“Gasps… Sixteen million one hundred thousand!” People gasped at the unbelievable price, their gazes at Luo Tian more greedy.

Qi Derong was nearly laughing out loud. Auctions loved this kind of situation—intense bidding was ideal. Plus, Luo Tian had a grudge with the Qi family; he had offended the old man, and even if Luo Tian didn’t die, he’d be severely injured. Qi Derong was happy to see it happen.

“Kid, I’ll give you one last chance. Give me your spiritual stones and this will be over!” The old man’s face was at its worst, his teeth gritted as he spoke. He wasn’t foolish; he saw Luo Tian’s determination and had no intention of continuing the fight. He planned to attack Luo Tian after he left the auction.

“Go…!” Luo Tian’s voice was light but clear in everyone’s hearts.

“This kid is crazy, daring to offend the old man!” People were impressed by Luo Tian’s audacity. He was bolder than Beichang County’s cultivators, daring to challenge a Bone Refinement early stage with his ninth-stage Body Refinement.

“This is nothing. Two days ago, he even drove away the Qi family patriarch! I don’t know what this world lacks that he dares to do!” People chattered loudly.

Qi Derong naturally heard the people’s words, his face darkening. He coldly snorted and slammed his hammer onto the table: “Sold!”

The attendant handed the Flame Iron to Luo Tian. He casually tossed a storage bag onto the tray. After inspection, the attendant was shocked—Luo Tian had truly produced sixteen million one hundred thousand spiritual stones. Previously, people often bid high but couldn’t pay.

“His movement of tossing the storage bag suggests he has more! Even if you’re a disciple from a major sect, it won’t help!” A group of Bone Refinement early-stage masters showed ferocity, making a decision.

People murmured for a while. Qi Derong cleared his throat and continued the auction, items being exchanged into white spiritual stones. However, Luo Tian didn’t bid again, leaving people disappointed and speculating if he had run out of spiritual stones.

“Next, I’ll announce the final item up for auction—something everyone has been waiting for! Many have waited this long for it!” Qi Derong smiled, satisfied with the auction. He had sold so much that he had gathered over two hundred million spiritual stones, exceeding his expectations.

Luo Tian opened his eyes, his face showing anticipation. This was his first time seeing a grade-level martial art up for auction.

Others also had gleaming eyes. After all, this was their first time seeing a grade-level martial art, even the three families’ patriarchs showed slight concentration as they watched Qi Derong.

“What is this Qi family selling? I don’t believe a grade-level martial art would be sold!” Zhao family patriarch Zhao Hongyi spoke.

“See for yourself!” Huang family patriarch Huang Tianrui also showed interest.

Under everyone’s expectant gaze, Qi Derong held a jade slip. Though it was made of jade, people could sense an ancient aura from it.

“This martial art is called the Firing Heaven’s Inferno Array! I’m not sure of its exact effects. We at the Qi family haven’t been able to master it; my father found it in an ancient site!” Qi Derong sighed.

“Is this martial art difficult?” Someone asked.

“This martial art isn’t hard, but… it’s a fragmentary scroll!” Qi Derong sighed.

“Gasps…” People’s faces showed disappointment. Fragmentary scrolls were common, but finding the missing parts was like searching for a needle in a haystack.

The three families also showed disappointment. Though they had prepared, they still hoped this grade-level martial art was genuine.

The auction hall fell into disappointment. It was usable but unattainable, and a powerful grade-level martial art made people uncomfortable.

Luo Tian remained calm. Upon hearing the martial art’s name, his heart surged with waves. If it weren’t for the crowd, he would have jumped up. He suddenly remembered a martial art he hadn’t used in a long time—Flame Dragon Hands!

He clearly recalled that the subsequent martial art of Flame Dragon Hands was called Firing Heaven’s Inferno Array!

“Must obtain it!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed intense desire, but it vanished quickly. He knew he couldn’t show his interest in Firing Heaven’s Inferno Array here, or it would draw the three families’ attention and cause trouble.

Chapter 307: Firing Heaven’s Inferno Array

Chapter 307: Firing Heaven’s Inferno Array

Luo Tian hadn’t expected such a needle-in-a-haystack situation to happen. He felt he must have been a great good person in his past life; this probability was too high to be random.

As Luo Tian’s heart burned with excitement, Qi Derong spoke again: “Everyone, this is a fragmentary scroll. If you find the preceding martial art, it will be immensely powerful. Even if not, keeping it at home for collection is fine!”

Qi Derong saw people’s low spirits and wasn’t surprised. He had only used this grade-level martial art as an excuse to attract more people. The previous auction proceeds were enough for his father’s elixir money. He hadn’t planned to sell many of these grade-level martial arts, as they were impractical.

“Starting price one million. Everyone, begin bidding!” Qi Derong smiled, looking at everyone but especially the three families and other top-ranked families.

One million was only worth it for these families to buy a fragmentary scroll as a collection. Others, Qi Derong didn’t expect much.

“Eleven million!” The sixth-ranked Liu family bid first, just testing the waters with a casual price.

“After all, it’s a grade-level martial art. Let’s say fifteen million!” The fourth-ranked Li family lazily bid.

“Twenty million!” Huang Tianrui smiled and bid.

The three families, under people’s envious gazes, slowly raised their bids. The price gradually increased.

At this moment, Luo Tian was thinking about how to obtain the martial art without revealing his Flame Dragon Hands. These people were all old foxes; if he showed even a hint of clues, they would notice.

The price had risen to twenty-eight million. Luo Tian sneered and smiled lazily: “Thirty million…”

“Huh?” People were watching the three family patriarchs bidding when they heard a lazy voice from the black token area. People were surprised.

“Him again!” Mao Xingxiu’s face showed coldness, his mind already marking Luo Tian for death. Whether it was because Luo Tian had offended him before or because of his wealth, he had decided to kill him.

“He’s rich!” People gazed greedily at Luo Tian.

Wu Di sat beside Luo Tian, feeling the surrounding Bone Refinement masters’ greedy eyes. His face was cold with sweat.

The three family patriarchs, hearing Luo Tian’s bid, were surprised. They hadn’t expected this kid to dare compete with them.

“Who is this kid?” Zhao Hongyi’s spiritual sense probed Luo Tian, his mind puzzled.

Feeling several spiritual senses probing him, Luo Tian showed a hint of arrogance. His spiritual sense burst out, repelling the others’ senses.

Huang Tianrui smiled, his gaze at Luo Tian showing an enigmatic meaning.

“Hmph!” The other family patriarchs showed coldness. Their spiritual senses were repelled, which was a slight to the three family patriarchs. Those long at the top of Beichang County couldn’t tolerate it.

“Thirty-two million!” Han family patriarch Han Lihui coldly spoke, his gaze challenging Luo Tian.

This look carried strong provocation. It landed on Luo Tian’s eyes, making him smirk inwardly: “That’s exactly what I wanted!”

Luo Tian looked at Han Lihui, his face red like a provoked bull: “Thirty-five million!”

“Haha, this is interesting!” Han Lihui smiled. He wanted to completely crush this arrogant youth and show the three families’ authority.

“Forty million!” Han Lihui spoke calmly.

“Forty-five million!” Luo Tian’s face turned red, as if his blood had been stirred.

“Gasps… He dares to compete with the Han family patriarch!”

People gasped, their eyes filled with shock. This youth had given them countless surprises since arriving in Beiming City. The series of events were impossible for a ninth-stage Body Refinement to achieve.

“Not right, he’s not a fool. He should know the three families’ status in Beichang County. A fragmentary grade-level martial art, only a fool would risk angering the three families!” Mao Xingxiu thought quickly.

“Then there’s only one possibility!” Mao Xingxiu didn’t dare to continue thinking. His face showed joy, looking at Luo Tian and guessing his intention.

Not only Mao Xingxiu felt something suspicious about Luo Tian. Others also showed disbelief, gazing at him with intense greed.

Even the three families showed faces of surprise. Huang Tianrui’s face showed a bitter smile: “I hope it isn’t what I think. Otherwise, even I can’t protect you!”

Zhao Hongyi only thought for a moment before laughing: “I almost fell for it! You’re a clever kid!”

At this point, Luo Tian and Han Lihui’s bidding had reached its peak. Han Lihui hadn’t thought deeply, but he was shocked by Luo Tian’s wealth. The price had reached one hundred million spiritual stones.

Qi Derong was shocked, regretting he hadn’t killed Luo Tian when he first met him. Then all of Luo Tian’s wealth would have belonged to the Qi family.

“One hundred and twenty million!” Luo Tian knew he had likely exposed himself. Regardless, he bid again.

“Kid, you win!” Han Lihui said with killing intent. He hadn’t expected to be mocked like this, and it made him feel bad.

One hundred and twenty million spiritual stones for a useless martial art. Han family could afford it, but they couldn’t waste so much.

“Boom…” As Han Lihui’s words fell, the auction hall erupted in a deafening uproar. People stared at Luo Tian standing with bloodshot eyes, though some noticed something was off with him, most only focused on his wealth.

“Give it to me!” Luo Tian’s cold and domineering voice echoed, silencing the auction hall instantly.

Qi Derong’s face was grim. Clever as he was, he knew Luo Tian had an 80% chance of having the other half of the martial art. His face showed regret as he handed the jade slip to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian waved his hand, tossing a storage bag toward Qi Derong. He casually threw the jade slip into his storage ring.

Luo Tian knew only a few people could recognize he had Flame Dragon Hands. Most hadn’t realized yet. Now, he wanted to leave. Once people caught on and attacked him collectively, it would be a real problem.

Chapter 308: Ambush

Chapter 308: Ambush

Feeling the murderous glares around him, his eyes flashed coldly. He memorized their appearances and sent a mental message to Wu Di: “Prepare to leave. You go to the main gate first!”

Wu Di didn’t dare argue. He felt the auction hall was oppressive. This was his first time attending an auction, and he knew what Luo Tian had done would draw everyone’s hatred. Not for any reason—just because of his immense wealth.

Wu Di didn’t hesitate, walking toward the exit. Wu Di’s low cultivation of fifth-stage Body Refinement had already been ignored by others. Gradually, people realized and gazed at Luo Tian with fiery eyes.

Luo Tian sneered. His face showed no fear. He waved his sleeve, releasing a spiritual aura of late-stage Bone Refinement.

“This is the aura of late-stage Bone Refinement!” People were startled by this sudden pressure. Even the three family patriarchs trembled slightly.

On the platform, Qi Derong was about to announce the auction’s end when he felt a heart-stirring aura from below. His legs trembled, nearly collapsing. He looked down with disbelief: “Late-stage Bone Refinement!”

The young men of the three families also showed surprise. They considered themselves geniuses, but this youth was younger and had late-stage Bone Refinement.

“Not right! It’s just an aura! A fake!” The three family patriarchs said, their faces showing understanding. They sent out spiritual senses to check Luo Tian’s cultivation and shouted:
