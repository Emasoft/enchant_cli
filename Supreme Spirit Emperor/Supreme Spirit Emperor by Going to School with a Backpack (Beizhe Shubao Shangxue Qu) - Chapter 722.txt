“Are you seeking death?” Yao Chen stood up immediately, his long staff clutched in hand. His eyes glared at Wang Xiu; if it were anywhere else, he would have killed Wang Xiu already.

“Everyone, enter the small world. We’ll play later!” Luotian looked at the people from Hell and Heaven, speaking softly.

“Senior Candle Nine Shadow, I have arrived in haste. I don’t possess anything impressive, but I can offer you a pill to ease your pain,” Luotian said with a light laugh, stepping toward Candle Nine Shadow. His hands emitted waves of medicinal fragrance, and he presented a golden pill before the elder.

Though Luotian had nothing remarkable to offer, he was an accomplished alchemist—his skill in refining pills was of the highest grade.

As soon as he entered, Luotian noticed red patterns at the corners of Candle Nine Shadow’s eyes. Clearly, his body was infected with fire poison.

Candle Nine Shadow’s name was not his true name but that of a fearsome beast. His name itself, Candle Nine Shadow, denoted his formidable bloodline.

Candle Nine Shadow practiced water-element techniques. Yet Luotian sensed a latent fire within his body, clashing with his cultivation method. This clash did not kill Candle Nine Shadow but caused him immense pain.

“Did you notice?” Candle Nine Shadow’s eyes flickered with light, gazing at the pill in Luotian’s hand. He had not detected this latent fire before. Later, he discovered it was stable; by harnessing its clash with his technique, he could accelerate his cultivation. Thus, the fire grew stronger over time, erupting violently at midnight.

Though Candle Nine Shadow suppressed it with his supreme cultivation, the pain was unbearable.

“Every time your latent fire flares up, take this pill to ease it. When I exit the small world, I’ll refine another batch to completely eliminate it,” Luotian said.

“Good. If this is true, I owe you a favor!” Candle Nine Shadow replied. The pain was so intense it felt like death, and even he found it hard to endure.

Chapter 2733: Heavenly Flame Ranking

Favors are the hardest debts to repay, especially a favor from an Immortal King. Many sought it but failed. Luotian’s single pill was more effective than all the gifts they had given.

“Should’ve sent my uncle instead. Ha!” Jiang Yuzhe laughed, if it was about alchemy, who could rival Jiang Yuexiong?

“Yet the Holy Son of the Medicine King’s Sect, Bai Yao—called the ‘Medicine Chest’ for his infinite alchemical knowledge—failed to spot Elder Candle Nine Shadow’s issue. That’s embarrassing, isn’t it?” Jiang Yuzhe glanced at the youth who had previously offered gifts.

Because of Jiang Yuexiong, the Medicine King’s Sect and the Supplemental Heaven Sect had long been at odds. However, after the previous incident where the Supplemental Heaven Immortal King protected Luotian, relations between the Supplemental Heaven Sect and other sects had become delicate.

“Jiang Yuzhe, your sect only produced Jiang Yuexiong. What are you gloating about? If you’re不服, let’s duel in alchemy!” The youth’s face darkened as he addressed Jiang Yuzhe.

“Idiot. Why not challenge Jiang Senior? Not only would you lose to Jiang Senior, but even Luotian would defeat you!” Hearing the youth’s words, Ye Liangchen was unwilling and shot back.

“Ye Liangchen, who asked you to speak? Get out!” The youth’s face turned dark. To him, Ye Liangchen was merely a servant and had no right to speak with them.

“Bai Yao, be polite!” Jiang Yuzhe’s gaze turned cold as he looked at Bai Yao. Luotian, Xiao Dezhu, and others also turned their eyes toward Bai Yao.

Under the scrutiny of these people, Bai Yao felt uncomfortable, his pores opening instantly.

Seeing conflict between Heaven and the Tianyuan Sect, Hell’s people wore smirks, watching like spectators.

Other sects’ disciples glanced at the quarrel without intervening.

“Stop arguing! Where are we? The Mirage Sea Palace. Are you so bold as to fight here?” A youth shouted, his voice hoarse and unpleasant.

“Haha. When did a traitor gain the right to speak?” Hearing Gui Ming’s words, Hell’s people erupted in mockery.

Among Hell’s most hated factions, the Ghost King Sect ranked first—after all, it had defected from Hell.

One word led to a fight. What began as a clash between Ye Liangchen and Bai Yao escalated into a quarrel between two groups.

“Everyone, please be quiet!” Candle Nine Shadow barked, his forehead veins bulging. He gazed at the sect heirs.

“Why do you fight so fiercely? We don’t care. But since your elders sent you here, we must ensure your safety. Once inside the small world, you may settle your grudges freely,” Candle Nine Shadow said coldly. He would have ignored them if not for the agreement with Heaven and Hell.

As Candle Nine Shadow’s words faded, people redirected their attention to Bai Yao and Jiang Yuzhe. They remembered it was these two who had started the conflict.

“Jiang Yuzhe, dare to duel me? Not in cultivation, but in alchemy!” Bai Yao spoke coldly, eyeing Jiang Yuzhe.

“You’re so shameless!”

“Did you see? Luotian, this is my brother. Dare to duel him?” Ye Liangchen shifted his gaze to Luotian, challenging Bai Yao.

“Luotian?” Bai Yao’s face showed disdain. In alchemy, Bai Yao was confident he was among the top of Heaven. Except for a few from the Medicine King’s Sect and Jiang Yuexiong, no one could surpass him. Though Luotian had noticed Candle Nine Shadow’s issue, it didn’t mean his alchemical skill was superior.

Arrogance was inherent in every alchemist. Even Luotian had his share of it!

“Fight then! I don’t fear you. The Supplemental Heaven Sect has no one worth my attention besides Jiang Yuexiong!” Bai Yao’s gaze was arrogant, radiating confidence.

“Senior Tian?” Ye Liangchen turned to Luotian upon hearing Bai Yao’s words. He wasn’t sure if Luotian could match, but he dared not accept.

“You’re a troublemaker by birth!” Luotian chuckled lightly. He didn’t care much about duels, but Ye Liangchen had spoken so boldly; if Luotian backed down, it would be Ye Liangchen’s shame.

“Whatever,” Luotian said softly, earning Ye Liangchen a look of joy.

“We won’t duel in refining pills. It’s like I’m bullying you. After all, your village boy can’t match my techniques. Let’s duel in flame control!” Bai Yao sneered, never looking at Luotian seriously.

“Flame control?” Upon hearing this, Xiao Dezhu and others nearly spat out their drinks.

“Truly self-destructive!” Sun Ke Nian and others looked at Bai Yao with pity.

Flame control relied on fire and spiritual awareness. Luotian had Xiao Qi, who was fused with him; his spiritual strength was unmatched. Others even believed Luotian’s soul had reached the level of an Immortal King.

“Senior Candle Nine Shadow, is this allowed?” Bai Yao turned to the seated elder, asking.

Bai Yao wanted Candle Nine Shadow to witness his alchemical superiority. A flame control duel would highlight their differences, making the elder value the Medicine King’s Sect and align with them.

“As long as no one dies, it’s acceptable,” Candle Nine Shadow replied softly. He knew these people were hot-tempered.

*Hiss…*

As Candle Nine Shadow’s words faded, a scorching aura rose in the hall. White flames hovered in Bai Yao’s palm, flickering yet emitting a cold sensation.

“Spirit Frost Flame! Ranked eighteenth on the Medicine King’s Sect’s Heavenly Flame Ranking!” Bai Yao’s eyes gleamed with pride, addressing everyone.

“Hearing the Medicine King’s Sect has nearly a hundred heavenly flames. It is their sect’s foundation!”

“Higher rankings mean greater power!” The hall’s people looked solemn.

*Boom…*

As they marveled, a thunderous sound echoed. A red flame rose, and Bai Yao’s other hand conjured another flame.

The crimson fire radiated agitation, leaping violently in Bai Yao’s grasp as if seeking escape.

“Rank eighth on the Medicine King’s Sect’s Heavenly Flame Ranking, Eight Directions Divine Flame!” Bai Yao spoke again. Though the flame seemed small, it radiated astonishing power.

Chapter 2734: Duel

“Not bad,” Luotian’s eyes narrowed slightly. His flame mark on his forehead pulsed, sensing a threat—this danger was Xiao Qi’s doing.

Before the people could finish their amazement, a silkworm-like sound echoed. Golden divine light rose before Bai Yao, and golden flames appeared at his side.

“Rank fourth on the Medicine King’s Sect’s Heavenly Flame Ranking, Golden Cicada Sacred Flame!” Bai Yao spoke again, causing the hall’s people to gasp.

“Did you see? Rustic fellow, never seen so many heavenly flames at once!” Two youths behind Bai Yao looked at him with reverence and mocked Luotian’s group.

“Three heavenly flames, controlled simultaneously. Bai Yao Senior ranks in the top three at the Medicine King’s Sect. What can you match him with?” The two youths’ eyes gleamed with pride, praising Bai Yao endlessly.

“Indeed, he has talent,” the crowd mused. Initially, they thought Bai Yao’s strength was average—after all, dividing focus on alchemy would hinder cultivation. But controlling three flames proved his spiritual strength.

“Move aside!” Bai Yao barked, and the three flames surged forward, forming waves of fire. The three flames merged under everyone’s gaze.

“Good!” Luotian nodded. He had only seen such control in Fire Lord and Long Que.

Flames roared, three-color flames drying the hall’s humidity. Finally, they formed a tri-colored phoenix, spreading its wings above Bai Yao.

“Bai Yao Senior has merged three heavenly flames into a beast form. Soon, he’ll merge two more to achieve human form!” The Medicine King’s Sect disciples looked excited, watching the phoenix.

This phoenix was different from those conjured by martial arts—it felt truly alive and agile.

“Rustic fellow, do you have heavenly flames? I suppose you still use spiritual energy to ignite them!” Bai Yao smirked at Luotian.

“Indeed, I don’t have heavenly flames,” Luotian shook his head lightly but his eyes gleamed.

“Still, I thank you for this gift!” Luotian inwardly sighed. His flame mark pulsed.

“Xiao Qi, are you hungry?” Luotian muttered internally. Since his last use of the World-Devouring Crimson Lotus, Xiao Qi had been listless. After months of recovery, he still hadn’t fully recovered.

*Buzz…*

Luotian raised his hand, sending out a wave. A flame appeared in his palm.

At the moment the flame emerged, Bai Yao’s tri-colored phoenix froze, flapping its wings desperately to escape. Yet it was restrained by Bai Yao.

“What’s happening?” Bai Yao’s eyes widened in disbelief, unsure why this occurred.

As Bai Yao was astonished, a scorching aura surged. Ten-color flames hovered in Luotian’s palm, radiating brilliant light.

“This…!”

“How is this possible!” Seeing Luotian’s ten-color flames, Bai Yao and the two Medicine King Sect disciples were stunned.

“Ten colors…”

“The previous three-color flames had them praising endlessly. How impressive must this ten-color flame be!” Others were equally shocked.

Especially Hell’s people, seeing the ten-color flames, recalled Luotian’s World-Devouring Crimson Lotus that had crippled Tai Ping Pavilion Master. It was this crippling that led to his execution by Gu Tian.

*Boom…*

As they spoke, the ten-color flames erupted. No need for Luotian’s control; the flames formed a human shape, rushing toward Bai Yao’s tri-colored phoenix.

“Damn it!” Bai Yao panicked. He knew the enemy of heavenly flames was human-form flames.

“Return to me!” Bai Yao had no will to fight. Human-form flames were beyond his three-color heavenly flames!

“Human… human-form flames!”

“Our sect’s top-tier Supreme Flame, the Human-Form Flame, commands nearly a hundred heavenly flames. It is said they were split from the Supreme Flame!” The two Medicine King Sect disciples spoke.

As they spoke, the ten-color flames flew forward. Three feet tall, it took a child’s form, wrapped in ten-color flames, and rode the tri-colored phoenix.

Phoenix cries echoed. The phoenix let out a piercing sound but dared not resist, floating above Bai Yao.

“What do you want? I surrender!” Bai Yao shouted, trying to retrieve the tri-colored flames. Yet he found them uncontrollable.

Xiao Qi opened his mouth, sucking in the tri-colored phoenix. Not only that, three flames sprouted on Bai Yao’s body—each no larger than a palm but radiating world-destroying power. If unleashed, they could incinerate everything.

These three flames were the original sources of the three heavenly flames. Now, they were completely beyond Bai Yao’s control.

“Thanks!” Luotian smiled, watching the three-color flames encircling Xiao Qi.

“Give them back!” Bai Yao went mad, reaching for Xiao Qi. Those three heavenly flames were his lifeblood; he couldn’t let them escape.

“Huh? Playing dirty? I’ll join!” Yao Chen sneered. He had long wanted to act, and now he had the chance. His staff swept toward Bai Yao.

*Boom…*

A dull sound echoed. The long staff struck Bai Yao, sending him flying.

“Full. Tired.” Xiao Qi had absorbed the three original heavenly flames and yawned, imprinting a flame mark on Luotian’s forehead.

*Plop…*

Bai Yao spat blood, his face pale. His aura was withered. The three heavenly flames were closely tied to him; now that Xiao Qi had taken them, the damage was severe.

“Still want to fight? What else?” Luotian looked at Bai Yao’s pale face, speaking softly. He eyed the fat sheep, hoping for more unexpected gains.

“Return my flames!” Bai Yao glared at Luotian, his eyes filled with hatred. Hearing Luotian’s words, he spat another mouthful of blood.

“Return? Impossible. Unless you bet something else. If you win, I’ll return them!” Luotian smiled, but this smile made Bai Yao shiver.

Chapter 2735: Dueling Pills

“Already lost before the duel…” People sighed, watching Bai Yao with pity. Merging three heavenly flames into a beast form was formidable, but it met Luotian’s ten-color flame and was devoured. Anyone in his place would feel bitter.

“Bet?” Bai Yao’s eyes flickered with thought upon hearing Luotian’s words. He knew Luotian was setting a trap, making him pay more to reclaim the three heavenly flames.

Heavenly flames were too precious; Bai Yao couldn’t part with them. No one could.

“How to bet?” Bai Yao bit his teeth, gazing at Luotian, calculating.

“Walked into the trap…”

“He’ll lose everything!” Seeing Bai Yao’s question, Xiao Dezhu and others smiled slightly. They knew Luotian well.

“Everyone is an alchemist. Let’s duel in pills. I won’t bully you. You’re the most confident about your pills, right?” Luotian gazed at Bai Yao, like luring a virtuous woman.

“Duel in pills?” Hearing this, Bai Yao’s eyes gleamed. If it was about strength, he admitted Luotian’s superiority—after all, Luotian had killed many strong opponents.

But in pills, Bai Yao felt an 80% chance of victory. He hadn’t heard of Luotian refining pills before.

“Good, I’ll duel!” Bai Yao thought for a moment and agreed.

“But don’t rush,” however, as Bai Yao just agreed, Luotian interrupted him. Bai Yao was momentarily stunned.

“Want to back out?” Bai Yao’s face showed disdain. He feared Luotian would backtrack.

“Back out? Impossible. I mean, what do you bet? What can match heavenly flames?” Luotian sneered at Bai Yao.

“I…” Upon hearing this, Bai Yao’s face changed. Something matching heavenly flames was definitely not ordinary.

Bai Yao thought, what did he have? After thinking for a while, he couldn’t find anything matching heavenly flames. Heavenly flames were priceless.

“No items?”

“You can bet something else, like your hands or feet!” As Bai Yao was speechless, Luotian’s cold voice echoed in the hall.

“You…” Bai Yao’s face darkened. He hadn’t expected Luotian to propose such a bet.

“Interesting!”

“This time, Bai Yao is stuck. If he doesn’t bet, it’s surrender. If he does, and loses, it won’t just be losing hands or feet—it might even cost his life!” Hell’s people discussed.

“Coward, what’s wrong? You’re not confident in your alchemy?” Ye Liangchen mocked, his voice filled with triumph.

“Exactly. Besides bragging, I don’t know what else he can do!” Xiao Dezhu and Sun Ke Nian added fuel to the fire, inciting further.

Bai Yao listened to Xiao Dezhu’s words and grew angrier. Finally, he gritted his teeth: “Fine! I’ll bet. But it must be fair; you can’t use heavenly flames!”

“Please, Senior Candle Nine Shadow, witness this. If Bai Yao wins, I’ll return one heavenly flame. If I win, I’ll cut off his hands!” Luotian smiled, bowing to Candle Nine Shadow.

“Only one?” Bai Yao roared. He hadn’t expected his hands to be worth only one heavenly flame.

“What do you think my hands are worth? If it weren’t for avenging my brother, would I be so bored?” Luotian coldly replied.

“Good. I’ll bet!”

“How to duel?” Bai Yao’s mind was still confident, calculating secretly. If he won, he’d find a way to duel Luotian again and reclaim the heavenly flame. Even if he lost, his hands could regrow via world power.

“Simple. Let’s refine pills. Whoever makes better pills wins!” Luotian spoke softly.

“Truly self-destructive. Our sect’s Holy Son is a seven-star immortal alchemist. The Medicine King Sect has countless pill formulas. His title ‘Medicine Chest’ comes from his infinite formulas. No one surpasses him except the Medicine King himself!” Two Medicine King Sect disciples boasted again.

“Hmph. Just now, he bragged about his heavenly flames’ strength… then they were taken!” Xiao Dezhu and Sun Ke Nian naturally didn’t let up, mocking them. The two sides were full of tension.

As they spoke, everyone left the hall and stood on a jade-colored ground. The hall was too small for refining.

“Just with herbs, he can’t beat me!” Bai Yao sneered, adjusting his state and thinking about what pills to refine.

*Boom…*

But Luotian seemed prepared. He immediately summoned the Sea and Mountain Cauldron, emitting an ancient aura.

“This cauldron…” Bai Yao looked at it, his eyes narrowing. His alchemical expertise immediately recognized its uniqueness.

“This is the Sea and Mountain Cauldron!” Luotian spoke softly, slapping the cauldron’s lid open.

“Clear Void Pills, seven-star!” Luotian muttered internally. He had already decided what to refine—Clear Void Pills for Candle Nine Shadow. However, Clear Void Pills were for removing internal latent fire, but Candle Nine Shadow’s was too strong and deeply rooted. Ordinary Clear Void Pills couldn’t remove it, so Luotian had modified them with ten times the power and added nearly a hundred herbs.

Seeing Luotian’s cauldron, Bai Yao stood up. He waved his hand, summoning another cauldron before everyone’s eyes.

“Divine Farmer’s Cauldron!”

“Indeed, the Divine Farmer’s Cauldron!” The two Medicine King Sect disciples gasped.

“This is one of our sect’s top-tier divine artifacts, forged to three-tenths the power of world treasures!” Their eyes showed confidence. They knew this alchemy duel had already been won by Bai Yao.

“Hmph, he has some skill,”

“Maybe I’ll be caught off guard!” Luotian muttered internally. His cauldron was alive; it followed those destined to it. The higher the alchemical skill, the more likely it was to gain a top-tier cauldron’s approval.

“You’re using what to win?” Bai Yao seemed to regain his confidence, his aura changed. He began throwing herbs into the Divine Farmer’s Cauldron.

Luotian chuckled and focused on throwing herbs one by one into his cauldron.

Flickering shadows, both started slowly but soon their herb-throwing speed increased rapidly.

“Ten魂摘星手 (Ten Soul Star-Picking Hands)! Bai Senior uses a technique only peak Immortal Kings can master!” The two Medicine King Sect disciples looked excited.

“But what technique is Luotian using? It’s no less than Bai Senior’s Ten Soul Star-Picking Hands. I underestimated him,” but their eyes soon turned to Luotian.

Chapter 2736: Clear Void Pills

On the jade-colored ground, Luotian and Bai Yao continuously cast their hands. Blinding hand shadows sent herbs into their respective cauldrons.

Time passed slowly. *Boom!* The lids of both cauldrons closed simultaneously, entering the next phase.

Spirit energy surrounded them, forming red flames that poured into the cauldrons, fiercely refining the herbs inside.

“Truly far behind Xiao Qi’s flames!” Luotian muttered internally. He felt the fire from spirit energy was at least one level below Xiao Qi’s. At the same time, he anticipated what level Xiao Qi would reach after absorbing three high-grade heavenly flames.

Bai Yao was no better off. Due to his cultivation level, his herb-refining speed was slower than Luotian’s.

The scene calmed. Both consumed their cultivation, focusing on refining the herbs in their cauldrons.

“Boring…” People yawned. Except for the two Medicine King Sect disciples, others weren’t interested in pills but watched to see the result.

Time passed slowly. Three hours later, a thunderous sound echoed. With this sound, the calm sea surface rose black clouds, and pressure descended.

“Finished? A pill refinement thunderstorm!” As the pressure arrived, people impatiently looked at Luotian and Bai Yao.

“Divine Thunder Refinement Pills!”

“Done!” Bai Yao shouted, slapping his cauldron. A thunderous sound echoed, as if countless lightning bolts were raging inside.

*Crack…*

A bolt of lightning split the heavy clouds, echoing with the thunder within the cauldron. The Divine Farmer’s Cauldron’s surroundings of ten thousand zhang were filled with lightning power.

The cauldron lid opened. A bolt of lightning flew out, colliding with the descending thunderstorm.

Heaven and earth roared. The violent waves swept through the Mirage Sea Palace’s surrounding waters, causing them to explode.

“This is the power of a pill refinement thunderstorm. Comparable to an Immortal King’s strike. Hmph, Bai Yao’s strength isn’t great, but his alchemy is impressive,” people marveled.

*Boom boom boom…*

Lightning continuously fell. Each bolt carried world-destroying power, clashing with the thunderstorm.

“Thirty-six bolts!” The two Medicine King Sect disciples gasped, counting the number of thunderstorms.

After thirty-six bolts, violent lightning filled every corner of the world.

A surge of energy rose, as if it were life after destruction. Under people’s amazement, the Divine Farmer’s Cauldron’s sky expanded a vortex, absorbing surrounding lightning energy.

An hour later, a green pill appeared in people’s sight. They could clearly see thunder patterns on the pill.

“Seven-star pill, Divine Thunder Refinement Pills. It’s just one step away from eight stars!” Bai Yao was satisfied with his pill, addressing everyone.

“Bai Senior, a prodigy!” The two sect disciples immediately praised. Unless Luotian could refine an eight-star pill, it would be hard to win.

Eight-star alchemists? According to their knowledge, the entire Heaven had few eight-star immortal alchemists, all within the nine sects.

“Senior Tian, won’t there be a problem?” Seeing Bai Yao’s Divine Thunder Refinement Pills, Ye Liangchen looked worried.

“Don’t worry!”

“In other aspects I don’t know, but in alchemy, I’ve never seen Luotian lose. In fact, his alchemical skill is even more terrifying!” Xiao Dezhu patted Ye Liangchen’s shoulder, showing confidence.

“Hmph. Don’t fear the wind will make you tongue-tied. He refined his pills earlier, but hasn’t finished yet. Probably exploded the furnace!” Hearing Xiao Dezhu’s words, Bai Yao’s two Medicine King Sect disciples sneered and rebutted. In their view, Luotian would definitely lose.

*Boom boom…*

As their words faded, a thunderous sound echoed. The Sea and Mountain Cauldron’s lid shook continuously. White smoke spilled, cold air spreading everywhere.

*Crack…*

Cold air began to spread, even freezing the flames Luotian had cast.

A purple lightning bolt as thick as a water bucket descended, striking the Sea and Mountain Cauldron.

*Buzz…*

At the same time, the cauldron lid opened. A white pill appeared, surrounded by wisps of mist. The entire world seemed frozen.

A terrifying cold power instantly clashed with the purple lightning, astonishingly freezing it. Finally, it shattered into violet ice crystals, drifting with the wind.

*Hiss…*

People gasped. Their eyes were filled with awe, looking at Luotian. They hadn’t expected him to refine such a pill.

Not only that, the cold power still spread, even reaching the thunderstorm clouds above.

“Cold!” People shivered. This cold power was too strong.

“Kid, are you trying to freeze us all in the Mirage Sea Palace?” Candle Nine Shadow chuckled lightly, sending out a wave to protect everyone in the Mirage Sea Palace.

Yet Candle Nine Shadow’s eyes showed excitement. He felt this cold power was pleasant to him.

One… two…

Each lightning bolt fell, carrying world-destroying power. Yet they were all frozen and shattered.

“Seventy-two bolts!” Bai Yao and the two Medicine King Sect disciples looked in disbelief. Luotian’s thunderstorm was double theirs.

“Impossible! This is the number of a eight-star pill refinement thunderstorm! He only refined a seven-star pill!” Bai Yao gasped. As an alchemist, he wouldn’t misjudge. Luotian had definitely refined a seven-star pill.

“Naive!” Luotian sneered, watching the thunderstorm shatter. He collected the cold-emanating pill.

“Clear Void Pills, seven-star. I added Glacial Snow Lotus, Nine-Turn Ice Spirit Flower, and Nine-Yin Giant Flower… I elevated the Clear Void Pills’ quality one level!” Luotian spoke softly, presenting the pill to Candle Nine Shadow.

“Senior, in seven days, taking this will eliminate your issue!” Luotian addressed Candle Nine Shadow.

“Eight-star? You’re an eight-star immortal alchemist?” Bai Yao’s eyes showed disbelief. He hadn’t expected Luotian to be an eight-star immortal alchemist.

“Hiding your talent, do you understand?” Ye Liangchen laughed immediately, gazing at Bai Yao.

“Sort of. Though refining eight-star pills is difficult, this kind of eight-star pill is acceptable!” Luotian chuckled, gazing at Bai Yao.

“I…” Bai Yao had no words. Who won or lost was clear.

Chapter 2737: Severing Hands

“Willing to accept the bet?” Luotian smiled, as Candle Nine Shadow took the pill. The cold power vanished, but to Bai Yao, Luotian’s gaze was colder.

“I…” Bai Yao’s face turned pale. If he truly lost his hands, he couldn’t enter the small world. Even if he could recover via world power, it wouldn’t be immediate. Once inside the small world, there would be a fierce battle; how could he fight Hell’s sect heirs without hands?

“Don’t be too harsh, Luotian!” Before Bai Yao responded, Heaven’s people shouted. Bai Yao was a Heaven strength; now they were united against him.

“What? You can’t handle it?” Seeing Heaven’s people protest, Luotian’s eyes flashed with coldness.

“I don’t mind. I’ll have Senior Candle Nine Shadow return this favor here and eliminate you!” Luotian sneered, scanning the sect heirs.

*Boom…*

A golden staff stood on the ground. Yao Chen rubbed his hands, looking at Heaven’s people with a smile. A dull sound echoed in people’s ears.

“Fight now? It saves us from killing you inside the small world!” Yao Chen sneered. He was an Immortal King late stage; these sect heirs were no match.

Seeing Yao Chen’s arrogance, both Hell and Heaven people turned dark.

“Fight?”

“I love fighting after eating!” Chen Zhanbiao grinned, clenching his fists with a crisp sound. His eyes showed excitement.

“Zhanbiao, bring him over. I’ll see who dares to move!” Xiao Dezhu crossed his arms, looking like he was the only one. He seized every opportunity to show off.

Chen Zhanbiao took a step forward, his aura radiating. He walked toward Bai Yao.

“You dare!” Bai Yao shouted, his voice filled with madness. Losing hands meant he couldn’t enter the small world.

“Gui Ming, are you letting your ally be insulted?” But sensing Chen Zhanbiao’s aura, Bai Yao knew he was no match. He looked at Heaven’s sect heirs, hoping to persuade them; only then could he fight against Luotian’s group.

“Bai Yao, you must have a life-saving technique. Just release it!” Gui Ming and others watched Chen Zhanbiao approaching Bai Yao but didn’t help.

Yao Chen and Chen Zhanbiao had previously shone in fighting Hell’s army. Though not as strong as Luotian, they were known to Heaven and Hell through intelligence reports.

“Little brat, cheating!” As he spoke, Chen Zhanbiao appeared before Bai Yao. His height alone gave Bai Yao pressure.

“What are you doing!” Bai Yao shouted, stepping back but Chen Zhanbiao’s big hand fell toward his head.

*Whoosh…*

Wind moved. Chen Zhanbiao’s big hand missed, and Bai Yao’s body appeared ten zhang away. He gazed at Chen Zhanbiao.

“Huh? You have some skill!” Chen Zhanbiao’s eyes flickered. He stepped on the ground, his massive body becoming a streak of light, vanishing from sight.

In an instant, Chen Zhanbiao appeared before Bai Yao. Again, his big hand reached for Bai Yao.

“This speed!” Everyone was stunned. Even Luotian and Xiao Dezhu were amazed. They had never seen Chen Zhanbiao move so fast.

“Since when did he refine this speed?” Xiao Dezhu and others exchanged glances. Especially Xiao Dezhu, who was most skilled in speed. This move of Chen Zhanbiao matched his own. However, Xiao Dezhu was currently an Immortal King mid-stage; if he reached late stage, his speed would surpass Chen Zhanbiao.
