"Boy, are you ready now?" Zhi Hong sneered, tearing off his monk's mask. No longer the serene monk he once appeared to be, his gaze locked onto Luo Tian.

"Ready!" Luo Tian nodded. He turned to Gu Qianxue and said, "Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Focus on boosting your cultivation first!"

"Yes," Gu Qianxue understood the gravity of the situation. Staying here was safest for her. If she attempted to break through, there would be intervals of rest—should these monks guard her, she'd risk both her life and endanger Luo Tian.

"Let's go," Luo Tian addressed Zhi Hong and the others, but his grip on the monk never loosened. This was his last resort—should Zhi Hong show any sign of treachery, he'd kill the man instantly.

"Boy, I'll wait for you at the 40th level," Zhi Hong's eyes flashed cold. He barked a command, and the group stepped out of the exit.

"I don't want to be your burden anymore," Gu Qianxue murmured softly, her eyes gentle. She began devouring pills, seated at the 30th level, sharpening her strength.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian and his group vanished from the 30th level. As soon as Luo Tian took a step, the monk in his grip disappeared. He materialized in a desolate land.

"No more time to waste," Luo Tian muttered, watching trees approach him. "I'll play at my own pace."

Luo Tian knew he couldn't outpace Zhi Hong. He had to move deliberately, as slowly as possible.

A hundred trees loomed before him, each massive and seemingly siphoning the land's vitality. "Crash..." The trees attacked immediately, their thick branches swinging down.

Luo Tian dodged instead of confronting them. He danced through the chaos, evading every strike. Time passed. It seemed he'd lingered in the 31st level forever. Later, even without using his cultivation, he evaded their attacks with sheer physical prowess.

A month passed. This time, Luo Tian spent an entire month in the 31st level. Finally, Zhao Tian Pagoda's cold voice echoed in his ears.

"A month without eliminating them!" The chilling voice made Luo Tian shiver involuntarily. His body moved.

"Boom... Boom..." Trees crumbled under his blows, scattering into dust across the heavens and earth.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian appeared in the 32nd level. To prevent him from lingering, Zhao Tian's voice rang out again—another month.

"Should be enough," Luo Tian mused, contemplating whether Zhi Hong would await him at the 40th level.

Chapter 2363: Artifact Spirit

"Butian Stone, go check if that old man is waiting at the 40th level," Luo Tian commanded. Sending Butian Stone to investigate was the most reliable choice.

Feeling Butian Stone depart, Luo Tian circled the 32nd level again. Unsettled, he delayed time as much as possible.

After circling for a while, Butian Stone returned with news: Zhi Hong wasn't at the 40th level. This eased Luo Tian's mind, though he'd suspected it, still a relief.

"Zhi Hong must be pushing through the gates with all his might. I have no more reservations now—full power ahead, but stay cautious," Luo Tian muttered, ordering Butian Stone to scout Zhi Hong and Huo Zhu's movements.

"Boom..." As he spoke, Luo Tian waved his hands. Black ghost claws descended from the sky, seizing a massive serpent's vital point on the 32nd level. The black serpent was split in two, and Luo Tian's body appeared at the 33rd level.

No longer hindered, Luo Tian charged like a wild horse. He surged straight to the 40th level in one go.

The entire 40th level was empty. Luo Tian had wasted over a month—even an immortal peak would have already passed through.

After brief rest, Luo Tian recovered to his prime and strode toward the 41st level.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian appeared, the world changed. A chilling aura swept over him. 100 armored immortal mid-level constructs materialized before him, charging forward.

"Indeed, this is a place that threatens immortal peak," Luo Tian observed the 100 mid-level constructs. Though they were only mid-level, their combined strength could harm an immortal peak. A weaker immortal peak would be severely wounded.

Luo Tian pushed forward without hesitation, his body moving like lightning. He let their attacks strike him, then swept his sword, wiping out a horde of constructs with one stroke. After three strikes, the constructs vanished from his sight. Luo Tian smoothly entered the 42nd level.

33...34... This time, it took seven days to reach the 50th level's rest space. He encountered a challenge—passing wasn't just about strength. After five days of contemplation, he solved it.

"Things get harder as you go on," Luo Tian sat in the 50th level's space, receiving Butian Stone's report. Meng Wushuang had reached the 72nd level, while Zhi Hong was at the 61st level, struggling.

"If I'm not mistaken, this is where it can threaten immortal peak," Luo Tian sighed. After the 60th level, it would be critical—capable of threatening even an immortal king's initial stage.

Luo Tian sighed deeply and stepped into the 51st level. A powerful aura swept over him, distinct from the previous 50th level—like a watershed.

"Roar..." A golden dragon coiled upward, charging at Luo Tian. It resembled Long Jie but had blood-red eyes, surprising Luo Tian.

"Boom..." As he was surprised, the golden dragon's tail swept down. Simultaneously, a golden dragon's breath erupted from its mouth.

Luo Tian's eyes narrowed. This golden dragon's bloodline was rich—he could feel it.

"Buzz..." A black hand extended, colliding with the golden dragon's attack. It seized the dragon's tail and swung it down, smashing into the ground.

"Boom..." The earth cracked, the heavens trembled. As for the dragon's breath, Luo Tian ignored it entirely, firing a single finger that unleashed nine-colored flames, annihilating the scorching breath.

Boom after boom echoed. The black hand continuously swung the golden dragon, smashing it onto the ground—scene was breathtaking.

"Boom..." Finally, the golden dragon couldn't endure and shattered into fragments of divine laws, swirling through heaven and earth.

"Roar..." The dragon's voice echoed. Golden divine laws coalesced, forming a golden sword that hovered in Luo Tian's hand.

"Mid-tier immortal artifact?" Luo Tian's eyes brightened. He hadn't expected a mid-tier immortal artifact at the 50th level—evidently, this dragon was its manifestation.

"Not ordinary. This sword is mid-tier but has a spirit—its soul is a dragon!" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed, sensing the difference between this sword and others.

"Still, I have enough swords. After exiting, giving it to Long Jie would be appropriate," Luo Tian muttered. Though mid-tier, having a spirit meant infinite potential.

Luo Tian sheathed the sword and vanished from the spot, appearing at the 52nd level.

The sky was black. The earth was black. A cold aura swept over him, making Luo Tian shiver slightly. Yet this chill felt familiar.

"This is..." he murmured.

"Hell's aura!" Luo Tian whispered, observing the environment. His eyes showed confusion as he saw black figures walking across the black earth.

"Roar..." The chaos of ghosts erupted. Luo Tian's arrival shattered this space's tranquility. Ghosts rushed toward him.

Ghosts roamed. Luo Tian marveled at the countless strange-shaped ghosts, wondering how so many existed here.

Upon closer inspection, he noticed each ghost bore a tiny Brahman seal. Unless scrutinized closely, it was hard to notice.

"This is a Buddha's Brahman seal!" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed. He'd seen Jie Du monk use it before.

"Roar..." As he pondered, a massive ghost arrived with a mountain-sized hand crashing down.

"This level isn't something an immortal peak can withstand!" Luo Tian instantly felt the challenge's intensity. Even a half-immortal king would likely perish.

"Still... this place is perfect for me!" Luo Tian laughed, firing a finger that blasted the ghost away. He then waved his hands, summoning the Yugui Seal.

"Indeed, it's been a while since I've practiced the Yugui Seal!" Luo Tian muttered. As the seal appeared, its suppressing aura erupted, instantly freezing the ghosts in place, their eyes filled with fear toward the Yugui Seal above Luo Tian's head.

"Dahei! Erhei!" Luo Tian waved his hands again. Dahei and Erhei appeared at his side. Seeing the endless ghosts, the two dogs barked loudly, drool dripping.

The Yugui Seal combined with Dahei and Erhei could suppress even nine reincarnated infants. How much more so these ghosts?

"Go eat!" Luo Tian commanded Dahei and Erhei, waving his hands to activate the Yugui Seal. The seal radiated divine laws, drawing in the ghosts' spiritual energy.

Zhao Tian Pagoda had a hundred levels. Even those who knew Zhao Tian's existence only knew it had 99 levels. The first 99 were trials, while the 100th level was accessible only to Zhao Tian's master. Another possibility was its artifact spirit, which selected masters.

At this moment, a translucent old man sat in the 100th level. His face bore a smile. Before him, the scene of Luo Tian and others traversing Zhao Tian Pagoda played out. His gaze focused mainly on Meng Wushuang and Zhi Hong, his eyes showing disappointment.

"Seems there's no hope. Without reaching immortal king mid-stage, passing the trial is impossible!" The old man muttered.

"Huh?" As he prepared to close his eyes, dismissing the group, thinking no one could pass, he suddenly felt a tremor. He saw the scene at the 52nd level—his body shook, eyes filled with disbelief.

But disbelief lasted only a moment before turning to regret. His breath quickened.

"Damn it, those ghosts were subdued by the Buddha when he walked through hell!" The old man watched the ghosts vanish, a third of them disappearing.

"Stop!" The old man bellowed, his voice filled with anger. It echoed in Luo Tian's mind, making him pause mid-ritual.

"Again!" Luo Tian realized the voice was the same as before, feeling guilty.

"Almost there! Just a little longer!" But Luo Tian only hesitated briefly before biting his teeth and not withdrawing the Yugui Seal or commanding Dahei and Erhei to stop.

"Idiot!" The artifact spirit stood up, glaring at Luo Tian ignoring his command. Yet he couldn't do anything—though an artifact spirit, he had to abide by the previous master's rules. Luo Tian was only at the 52nd level, so he had no authority to expel him.

"No problem?" Luo Tian saw no reaction. His eyes brightened, activating the Yugui Seal to absorb the ghosts.

"Idiot! I'll kill you!" The artifact spirit's eyes flashed anger. Seeing Luo Tian didn't stop, he cursed loudly. Though he couldn't change the rules, he had considerable authority—like adjusting the trial's difficulty.

Chapter 2364: The Strange Monkey

In the dark space, Luo Tian sat cross-legged. A black moon hovered above his head, radiating powerful waves.

The ghosts surrounding him had vanished eight-tenths. The artifact spirit was郁闷, wanting to vomit.

"I'll take just a little—should be no problem," Luo Tian felt guilty, looking at the scattered ghosts. Dahei and Erhei had already been stored away; they were satisfied after a feast.

"Yugui Seal perfected. Even an immortal king's ghost would bow to me!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with joy, gazing at the seal above his head—his greatest gain.

Luo Tian opened his mouth, drawing in an invisible wave that enveloped the seal. The Yugui Seal returned to his body.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian just stored the seal, waves descended upon him. It felt like driving him out of the 53rd level.

"Finally out!" The artifact spirit's body trembled, watching Luo Tian vanish from the 53rd level. His eyes showed joy.

"See how I'll kill you!" The artifact spirit growled, pressing his hand on the 54th level's image.

As Luo Tian appeared at the 54th level, he saw three massive mountains floating in the sky, radiating heavy energy.

"Endure the mountain's impact to pass," the artifact spirit's cold voice echoed. As his voice rang out, a thunderous sound followed.

The three golden mountains split into nine, making Luo Tian's mouth twitch. The nine mountains' energy was heavier than before, more than double.

"Is this something an immortal peak can pass?" Luo Tian cursed under his breath. Even he felt a strong danger.

"Boom..." Before he could react, one golden mountain trembled and crashed down. Wind swept over Luo Tian's body, making his face serious.

"This is targeting me!" Luo Tian cursed. He realized the warning from before at the 53rd level. This trial had increased difficulty. Not even an immortal peak could withstand it, let alone a half-immortal king.

"Boom..." Luo Tian didn't hesitate. He swung his fist, colliding with the golden mountain.

The thunderous sound was overwhelming. The golden mountain shattered into a storm of wind, sweeping in all directions.

Luo Tian's arm had cracks, but they healed instantly. Yet as the second mountain crashed down, his arms' cracks spread outward.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed. His second punch erupted with thunderous sound. This time, his legs visibly bent, and the cracks on his arms spread further.

"Huh? This kid actually has some moves!" The artifact spirit's face showed interest. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to endure, knowing the golden mountain's power. Originally three mountains could suppress an immortal peak, but he had changed it to suppress a half-immortal king—nine mountains in total.

"Interesting. Kid, there's still a long way to go. I'll play with you slowly," the artifact spirit said without concern, as if intrigued by Luo Tian. He had been too lonely in Zhao Tian Pagoda.

Boom after boom... Nine mountains thundered down, colliding perfectly. Even a slight lapse would result in injury.

"Cough... Cough..." Despite this, each strike shattered the golden mountains. Yet Luo Tian coughed blood, his body covered in wounds, breathing heavily.

"Damn it! I'm already this battered at the fifties!" Luo Tian cursed, surprised he was so helpless.

"Wait until I become your master, you bastard! I'll definitely kill you!" Luo Tian mentally cursed. He dared not speak aloud, fearing the artifact spirit would cause more trouble.

"Survived! I'll see how long you can last!" The artifact spirit's face bore a cold smile, adjusting the difficulty of Luo Tian's next trials.

Luo Tian watched the images flicker. He took a long breath, seizing the moment to take pills and recover.

Suddenly, scorching heat swept over him. Molten lava appeared in his vision, the world turning red.

The view was filled with scorching lava, like a vast swamp. Luo Tian's mouth twitched.

"Cross this lava to pass. Time limit: one hour!" The cold voice echoed. Luo Tian could even hear the excitement in its tone—evidently, this level's difficulty had been tampered with.

"This damn thing could scald a half-immortal king to death..." Luo Tian's mouth twitched, watching the scorching lava.

"Still..." Luo Tian spoke softly. He leaped into action, stepping directly onto the lava.

"Suicide! This lava is earthfire. Though not as strong as heavenly fire, it's close enough. And this vast amount of power even surpasses heavenly fire. If others had to do it, they'd need three hours. How can you pass in one hour?" The artifact spirit's face showed satisfaction, watching Luo Tian descend and step onto the lava.

Luo Tian's feet stood firmly on the lava, no discomfort. He strode toward the opposite shore.

"How is this possible!" The artifact spirit's face showed disbelief. Soon after, he noticed nine-colored light flashing under Luo Tian's feet, making his mouth twitch.

"Nine-colored human-form flames!" The artifact spirit exclaimed in shock. He couldn't believe his eyes.

"That seal that suppresses ghosts, and those two fierce pets—now human-form flames. What kind of luck does this kid have?" The artifact spirit muttered, having increased this level's difficulty to his maximum power. Yet he knew he couldn't harm Luo Tian at all.

Nine-colored human-form flames were the pinnacle of fire, suppressing all other flames. Luo Tian remained composed, taking each step slowly without haste. He wanted to use this opportunity to recover his injuries, as he didn't know what变态 trials awaited him next.

Time passed slowly. One hour elapsed. Luo Tian calmly stepped into the next level at the last moment.

"I don't believe you can be this lucky in the next level!" The artifact spirit's face showed anger. Thinking about what awaited him, he regained confidence.

"Level 56!" Luo Tian sighed softly, landing in the 56th level's space. A mountain stood before him.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian just landed, a terrifying pressure descended from the sky, enveloping him. His face slightly changed.

Without hesitation, Luo Tian raised his Longyuan Sword and met the attack head-on.

"Crack..." Thunder roared. A deafening sound echoed above Luo Tian's head, making his face pale and his body retreat.

As he retreated, he saw the opponent. His face changed instantly. A monkey with golden fur appeared before him, its eyes glowing gold.

"Uncle Monkey!" Luo Tian roared. His eyes showed disbelief—never expected to meet the monkey demon here.

But the monkey's state was clearly off. Its eyes lacked vitality, and its cultivation was at half-immortal king level—yet it was incredibly strong.

"Why is this happening?" Luo Tian's mind puzzled. He knew the monkey must have had issues, and the problem lay within Zhao Tian Pagoda.

"This is a rare beast from the primordial era. Originally at immortal peak, I've raised it to half-immortal king. How can you block it?" The artifact spirit's eyes showed satisfaction. He knew the monkey's strength.

"Uncle Monkey!" Luo Tian roared, but the demon showed no reaction. It raised its golden staff and strode toward Luo Tian, breaking space with each swing.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian mentally cursed. He couldn't harm the monkey, but after two clashes, he felt the monkey's strength—perhaps it was no weaker than himself.

The demon didn't care. It kept attacking, forcing Luo Tian to defend constantly.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian fought against the monkey. Both had formidable bodies, their battle causing the heavens to crack and winds to swirl.

"Brahman seal!" After continuous clashes, Luo Tian finally noticed a Brahman seal on the monkey's forehead.

"Is it enslaved?" Luo Tian felt distressed. The immediate priority was to subdue the monkey.

"I'll have to go all out!" Luo Tian muttered. His hands moved swiftly, activating the Tianren Dao Method to encircle two hundred miles around him. Simultaneously, he merged with his sword. The monkey's staff collided.

...Luo Tian flew out of the Longyuan Sword, his face pale. He gazed at the monkey, who also bled from his mouth.

"Uncle Monkey is still Uncle Monkey!" Luo Tian's eyes showed admiration. After several clashes, he had gained a slight advantage.

"Manifesting the World!" Luo Tian's hands moved swiftly. A thousand-zhang-tall giant stood in the heavens and earth.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian's body rose, the monkey's body also grew to match his height. The monkey swung its staff powerfully.

Chapter 2365: I'm Not Going

The thick staff thundered down, colliding with the wide sword. Two massive bodies retreated, shaking the ground.

Luo Tian and the monkey both spat blood. Luo Tian marveled at the monkey's strength, but it seemed to no longer recognize him.

"Roar..." The monkey roared, howling into the sky. Its blood seemed to be stimulated by battle, fearless and charging toward Luo Tian again.

Luo Tian's mouth twitched. He had no choice but to face it head-on, knowing the monkey would stop at nothing once it went mad.

They clashed. Neither could overcome the other—this was a震撼 scene. Only Luo Tian could match the monkey in body strength.

"Staff Shattering All Methods!"

No matter what methods Luo Tian used, the monkey countered with a thunderous staff, its aura unshakable.

"This kid is truly rare," the artifact spirit observed Luo Tian and the monkey's battle. He was amazed that Luo Tian could fight the monkey to such an extent.

"This monkey originally came to Zhao Tian Pagoda. Its mind was seized by the master's relic, so it became a guardian. It was quite unfortunate. Otherwise, with this monkey's talent, it would have become a great demon in the future," the artifact spirit said with regret. He recalled when the monkey was subdued by Buddha's light, feeling sorry for it.

The battle continued. Luo Tian was in a狼狈 situation. His massive body trembled, and the monkey wasn't faring much better but remained strong. Its thick staff's aura didn't wane.

"Troublesome!" Luo Tian mentally cursed. He couldn't kill the monkey, but if he could, he might have succeeded.

"蛮神一怒踏九天!" Luo Tian took a step forward, colliding with the monkey's attack. His massive body retreated.

"蛮神再踏碎星辰!" As he retreated, Luo Tian took another step forward, pressing down on the monkey.

"Roar..." The monkey roared. Luo Tian's "Banshen Step" made its blood boil. The battle-saint monkey race, born for war, had combat will embedded in their blood.

Bloodline power spread. The monkey's Brahman seal flickered, seemingly on the verge of breaking.

"Stimulated the monkey's bloodline!" Luo Tian's eyes flickered. He felt the monkey's madness and was pushed back again, but his heart held some joy.

"Bloodline power—able to break free from the master's subjugation?" The artifact spirit showed surprise again. He hadn't expected the monkey to change like this.

"Ban Shen Step Three..." Luo Tian's eyes brightened. His big foot took another step, the Banshen Steps unleashed. He no longer cared about anything now—after their clash, he knew the monkey wasn't easy to kill.

"Roar..." As if pulled by Luo Tian's Banshen Step, the monkey's aura surged. Golden fur fell from its body—three strands—and it instantly transformed into the monkey's form, rushing toward Luo Tian.

"What is this!" Luo Tian's eyes showed disbelief. Three monkeys rushed at him, none weaker than the monkey itself.

In an instant, the first monkey with a golden staff rushed in, colliding with Luo Tian's third step. The thunderous sound shattered the heavens and cracked the monkey's body, turning into a single hair that vanished from the world.

Before Luo Tian could react, the second monkey rushed in, colliding with his fourth step. The third monkey collided with his fifth step.

Boom... Two mountains collapsed under their battle, unable to withstand the clash. Shattered stones scattered around Luo Tian and the monkey.

"Cough... Cough..." Luo Tian coughed blood again. Five collisions—Luo Tian had no advantage.

"Roar..." The monkey rushed in again, but its Brahman seal flickered faintly. Its eyes gradually regained some vitality.

"Uncle Monkey, I've risked everything for you!" Luo Tian sighed. He looked at the equally battered monkey. His thick foot took another step, pressing down on the monkey.

"Ban Shen Step Six Shakes Heaven and Earth!" Luo Tian roared, taking his sixth step. A powerful pressure swept over him.

Luo Tian was now a half-immortal king, but if he forced the Ban Shen Step with Wind Slash, it would definitely be a challenge. Though not as bad as before where his leg was completely broken, he wouldn't be able to use one leg for the next period. This was disadvantageous for Luo Tian, as he still had another level to pass.

But he had no choice. The monkey had helped him greatly in the Nine Realms and also helped Long Jie. He realized only by stimulating the monkey's bloodline could he possibly restore it from subjugation. The only way to stimulate the monkey's infinite combat will was through a full-force battle.

Luo Tian's plan was correct. Under the immense pressure of Ban Shen Step, the monkey unleashed unprecedented combat will. Roaring, it gripped its golden staff. The Brahman seal on its forehead flickered violently.

In an instant, Luo Tian's big foot collided with the monkey's staff. At that moment, the flickering Brahman seal on the monkey's forehead exploded, as if erased by something.

"Boom..." The thunderous sound shook the heavens. Luo Tian's divine body and the monkey's divine body shattered, swirling dust spreading in all directions.

Luo Tian stood still. His right leg had no sensation. He gazed at the monkey lying on the ground.

The monkey slowly stood up, its body gradually becoming translucent. It gazed at Luo Tian, eyes filled with gratitude, and vanished from Luo Tian's sight.

In the endless dark hall, countless statues stood. Each statue was lifelike, with different appearances.

Two golden lights rose instantly, illuminating the entire hall. A monkey statue slowly crumbled, finally transforming into a real monkey—this was the monkey itself. The monkey gazed around, initially confused, then gradually clear-eyed.

"Luo Tian!" The monkey spoke slowly. Remembering the battle, it stood up and began to repeatedly strike the hall's door.

"Indeed, I've awakened him. I underestimated this monkey's bloodline!" The artifact spirit showed disbelief. He hadn't expected the monkey to escape from subjugation, which he thought was impossible.

"Damn it! That guy is breaking through the Unseen Hall!" The artifact spirit's face darkened. Yet he didn't move, as he had no authority to stop the monkey. This was a rule set by his predecessor—once someone could recover from that state and break out of the hall, they would regain freedom.

"What do I do?" Luo Tian's eyes showed bitterness. He knew the one he had fought was definitely the monkey itself, but it must have used some method to manifest as a physical form.

"I can only help you so much..." Luo Tian sighed deeply. He didn't know what awaited the monkey next, but he knew he would definitely face a tough time ahead.

"Buzz..." A sixth-tier pill appeared before Luo Tian, making his mouth twitch.

"The trials are difficult. Though this item is also good, it's not proportional to the trial's difficulty!" Luo Tian mentally cursed. Yet he was helpless within Zhao Tian Pagoda, moving down step by step—perhaps even dying.

Especially after seeing these two trials were so hard, he doubted if he could reach the 60th level's space. Passing these trials was purely due to his luck.

"Buzz..." The scene shifted again. Luo Tian appeared at the 58th level, which eased his mind. The 58th and 59th levels were relatively normal. Though the opponent was at half-immortal king level, Luo Tian's leg had no sensation and couldn't move. Still, he fought bloodily for three days to defeat the opponent.

"Boom..." Though he passed the 58th and 59th levels, when Luo Tian appeared in the 60th level's rest space, he felt completely drained. His body was battered and bloodied, some areas even caved in.

"Idiot..." Luo Tian mentally cursed. He fell to the ground, taking pills to recover.

Time passed slowly. A month had gone by. Luo Tian's wounds recovered under the pills' nourishment. His leg used in Ban Shen Step also healed, and his state returned to peak. He was delighted that his strength had improved significantly—evidently, the recent life-or-death experiences had enhanced him.

"I'm not going out anymore. Whoever becomes Zhao Tian Pagoda's master, let them do it. The 61st level should be able to threaten an immortal king's initial stage. That idiot will definitely trouble me. I'll die for sure!" Luo Tian mentally cursed, sitting in the 60th level and starting to cultivate.

"Not going out?" Seeing Luo Tian cultivating, the artifact spirit's eyebrows slightly furrowed. His greatest joy was to kill Luo Tian—this sensation had been long absent.

"Scared?" The artifact spirit felt irritated. He didn't have the authority to make Luo Tian leave immediately, so he could only wait slowly.

Time passed. Luo Tian stayed in the 60th level for a month, showing no intention of leaving.

"Damn it! This kid isn't going out. If he stays in there for years, I'll be bored!" The artifact spirit became impatient.

"Need to think of a way," the artifact spirit's eyes darted, watching the scene in Luo Tian's space. Then he saw clouds rising there, his eyes brightening.

Chapter 2366: Desperation

"Ugh... I wonder how Tianyuan Sect is doing?" Luo Tian sat in the 60th level. He had decided not to go out, unwilling to be killed by Zhao Tian Pagoda.

But Luo Tian was worried about Tianyuan Sect's situation. He had said he'd return in a month, but it had already been half a year. He was the sect's nominal leader—without him at the founding ceremony, it might affect Tianyuan Sect's prestige.

However, he had no choice. He hadn't expected to find Huo Zhu and end up trapped himself.

"Isn't it just ghosts? Why did they push me so hard?" Luo Tian mentally cursed. Soon after, he felt the sky darkening.
