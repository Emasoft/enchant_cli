“Damn it! He actually managed to refine the Qinglong Saint Body!” From the White Tiger Continent and the Vermilion Phoenix Continent, Jin Yongsi and Ke ZhenTian's furious roars echoed.

“With such a saintly body, am I not destined to enter the Nine Sources?”

“With this flesh and bone, attaining the Nine Sources—since now, who could possibly oppose me!” Four Supreme Beings of the Qinglong Sect had varying expressions; three of them bore a glimmer of greed on their faces.

Seeing the greed in their eyes, Sha Cangmang let out a cold snort and surveyed them with a piercing gaze: “Do you not yearn for transcendence?”

His cold voice resonated in their ears, causing their bodies to tremble slightly. Their gazes turned toward Sha Cangmang.

Transcendence—beings beyond the Nine Sources, legends say that after transcending, one could live eternally alongside heaven and earth, their hands capable of shielding the cosmos. Even heaven and earth could not subdue them.

Chapter 780: The Initiation of Body-Stealing

Chapter 780: The Initiation of Body-Stealing

The word “Transcendence” represented everything—symbolizing the cosmos, immortality, and supreme power.

Sha Cangmang’s voice was not loud, yet it carried the authority of an Eight-Source Supreme Being, descending into the minds of the four Supreme Beings.

“After waiting so many years and searching for so long, we finally found a suitable body for the Sect Leader. Now, it is within our grasp. Yet you harbored greed!”

“It is said that the Sect Leader possesses the method to fully unlock the Feng Shen Continent. The Feng Shen Continent holds secrets of transcendence. Yet you would ruin our years-long plan for the sake of a mere Nine-Source Supreme Being!” Sha Cangmang’s face bore an icy expression as he surveyed the four, his gaze scanning them. Any who moved would be crushed on the spot.

“Sect Leader is correct—this Qinglong Saint Body alone is trivial compared to transcendence. Its importance needs no explanation! I concur with the Sect Leader’s decision!” A Seven-Source Supreme Being spoke, unsure whether it was out of fear of Sha Cangmang’s power or belief in his reasoning.

After a brief silence, the other three let out bitter smiles, suppressing their greed and nodding toward Sha Cangmang.

“Prepare yourselves; prepare to welcome the Sect Leader!” Sha Cangmang sighed, standing before the black cauldron, awaiting the emergence of the Sect Leader.

At the same time, Ke ZhenTian and Jin Yongsi could no longer remain seated. They both soared from their respective sects, becoming streaks of light that flew toward the Qinglong Continent.

“With the Sect Leader reborn, today marks the closure of the Qinglong Continent—no one is allowed to enter or exit!” Sha Cangmang declared. He knew other continents had already learned of the news and would not ignore it.

That day, no cultivators were permitted to ascend into the sky; countless runes emerged from the Qinglong Sect, enveloping the entire Qinglong Continent and sealing it.

That day, the ancient Qinglong Bell of the Qinglong Sect rang ceaselessly, its thunderous echoes shaking the entire Qinglong Continent and causing panic among its people.

At that moment, Luo Tian stood within the Painful Soul Cauldron, his face cold as he gazed at the old man’s soul entering his body. Luo Tian knew this was likely the Sect Leader’s soul. If he destroyed it, he would still be himself.

“Qinglong Saint Body!” But before Luo Tian could act, a voice echoed—another old soul transformed into a streak of light and rushed into the black cauldron.

The gray light moved swiftly; Sha Cangmang and the others, preoccupied with activating runes to maintain the altar’s function, could not stop it. They watched helplessly as the gray figure plunged into the black cauldron.

“After years of patience, I finally found a body suitable for me…” To Sha Cangmang’s surprise, after the first streak of gray light entered the cauldron, more streaks of gray pierced the sky and rushed into it.

“This must be the souls of long-dead masters from the Qinglong Continent, who have lingered for years without finding a suitable body or deemed ordinary flesh unworthy!” A Supreme Being spoke, his gaze filled with disbelief.

Sha Cangmang’s brow furrowed slightly. Though confident in the Sect Leader, these souls were clearly no pushovers—lowest among them was a Seven-Source soul, with two reaching Eight Sources.

“Everything now rests on the Sect Leader himself!” Sha Cangmang sighed, regretting his oversight of the native souls of the Qinglong Sect.

Within the black cauldron, the Sect Leader’s body opened its eyes, a touch of age in its gaze.

“This body is truly suitable for me!” A young voice echoed within the vast cauldron, youthful yet imbued with an inexplicable sense of age.

“Hum…” At the same time, the first streak of light entered the black cauldron, its face contorted with madness.

“Qinglong Sect’s Sect Leader!” The gray soul paused upon encountering the other.

“Kill!” As the gray figure hesitated, more souls rushed in, their faces marked with greed as they lunged toward the Sect Leader’s soul.

“Hum…” The Qinglong Sect’s Sect Leader soul, disturbed by these souls, was forced to exit Luo Tian’s body, its face etched with anger.

“Back when I dominated the Great Qinglong Continent and the Four Sacred Star Domains, where were you? How dare you attack me!” The Qinglong Sect’s Sect Leader was no less formidable, his former might undiminished despite years of dwelling within the black cauldron. His face, gray and solid as stone, bore no fear as he clashed with the souls.

The thunderous sound of battle echoed within the black cauldron, and wisps of gray energy burst forth, alarming Sha Cangmang and the others.

Luo Tian stood within the smallest, most unassuming Painful Soul Cauldron at the bottom, his face curled in a sneer as he watched dozens of old souls battling one another. “I had some reservations about the Sect Leader’s soul, but now it seems after eliminating these souls, he’ll be nearly drained!”

Luo Tian observed their battle; though the souls were powerful, they paled in comparison to the Sect Leader’s soul. Even he was wary of them. If it were a battle of souls alone, even a hundred Luos would not match the Sect Leader.

Yet Luo Tian had confidence—after all, this body was his, and who could rival him within it?

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian waited like a hunter, watching the old souls and the Sect Leader clash until their deaths.

As expected, after an hour of battle, the Sect Leader smiled and crushed the last soul, its gray form dimming.

“Finally over! From today on, I live again!” The Sect Leader’s face was filled with excitement as he stepped into Luo Tian’s body.

After countless years of waiting and solitude, the legendary founder of the Qinglong Sect was about to be reborn.

“Now!” But as Luo Tian stood within the Painful Soul Cauldron, he suddenly leapt out like an eagle seizing its prey, rushing into his own body.

Luo Tian’s emergence was too sudden; the Sect Leader, exhausted from battle and caught off guard in his joy of rebirth, barely reacted.

“Who are you?” The Sect Leader was flustered, his face filled with disbelief—despite being an ancient master, he was still startled.

“This body’s true owner!” Luo Tian rushed into his body and immediately seized control, his soul force surging toward the Sect Leader.

With the advantage of home ground and having endured a fierce battle, the Sect Leader was nearly drained. In moments, Luo Tian forced him out of his body and captured him.

“Don’t kill me; we have no grudge!” The Sect Leader’s aged face finally showed fear as he spoke to Luo Tian.

“You sought to possess me without a grudge!” Luo Tian sneered, swallowing the Sect Leader’s soul entirely.

Luo Tian had not devoured the Sect Leader’s soul to strengthen his own, but to absorb the Sect Leader’s insights and experiences.

“Hum…” In an instant, countless images flooded Luo Tian’s mind, shaking his spirit. His face alternated between disbelief, shock, and anger. After an hour of devouring the Sect Leader’s soul, Luo Tian finally completed the absorption.

Within the Sect Leader’s memories, Luo Tian witnessed countless scenes—most notably a memory of the Tianyuan Continent, which was what he had long sought.

In the Sect Leader’s memories, Luo Tian learned that the Tianyuan Continent had once been a land like the Qinglong Sect’s, filled with masters and cultivators. Yet it had become what it was now due to the emergence of a certain faction.

The Ming Domain! From the Sect Leader’s memories, Luo Tian discovered that the Ming Domain’s strength rivaled the Four Sacred Star Domains. Once, it had launched an attack on the Four Sacred Star Domains, with the first battlefield being the Tianyuan Continent.

All forces of the Four Sacred Star Domains had participated in that battle, which was brutal and devastating. The vast Tianyuan Continent had been nearly shattered; only the native masters’ final sacrifice saved it. Otherwise, the Tianyuan Continent would have ceased to exist.

Through the efforts of all its masters, the Ming Domain was finally repelled. Though the Four Sacred Star Domains won, the cost had been the lives of all Tianyuan Continent’s masters.

What enraged Luo Tian most was the Four Sacred Star Domains’ Sect Leaders’ actions at that time. While the Tianyuan Continent had been the main force, the Four Sects had delayed their support, missing the opportunity and causing massive losses.

Moreover, to prevent the Tianyuan Continent’s people from spreading the truth of the Four Sects’ delayed aid, which would damage their reputation, the four Sect Leaders had joined forces to seal the Tianyuan Continent.

Four ancient masters stood at the domain’s edge, their divine power forming serpentine runes that encircled the entire Tianyuan Continent. Luo Tian could even sense the domain’s heavenly laws roaring in fury.

“From now on, there is no Sect Leader in the Tianyuan Continent!” The four figures bore an air of pride as they vanished beyond the domain.

Chapter 781: Ascending to the Sixth Source

At last, Luo Tian understood—Xiangu Continent and Wangyue Continent, along with the Tianyuan Continent, had once been a single land, fragments of the Tianyuan Continent that had shattered.

From then on, the Four Sacred Star Domains only knew of their alliance against the Ming Domain and paid homage to the four sects, but they had no knowledge of the Tianyuan Continent’s existence. It had been forgotten by all.

Anger and resentment stirred within Luo Tian as he clutched the last remnants of the Qinglong Sect Leader’s soul. He spoke softly: “A fine statement—‘From now on, there is no Sect Leader in the Tianyuan Continent!’ You deserve death!”

He crushed the soul with a single hand, his face cold. “My strength is still insufficient; though my body has reached the Ninth Source, I lack the comprehension of primal power. I must still be patient. When my strength becomes overwhelming, I will make these four sects regret their actions!”

Outside, Sha Cangmang and the others wore expectant expressions as they waited for the Sect Leader’s emergence. The thunderous sounds from within the black cauldron had alarmed them, but now it was quiet. They did not know if the Sect Leader had succeeded, yet Sha Cangmang felt a high probability of his victory.

“Hum…” A fluctuation of energy emerged from the black cauldron, causing Sha Cangmang and the others to stir.

“He is coming out!” An elder Supreme Being spoke, his gaze turning toward the Painful Soul Cauldron’s powerful fluctuations.

A nine-colored aura burst from the black cauldron, piercing into the sky and spanning across heaven and earth. A figure with long flowing hair emerged from the cauldron, standing within the nine-colored aura. His golden headband swayed with the gusts of energy, and his two eyes radiated intense light like twin suns.

“Seal the Soul!” Sha Cangmang’s face lit with excitement as he saw Luo Tian’s emergence, immediately activating a formation.

Though Sha Cangmang was naturally inquisitive, he remained unusually clear-headed despite his excitement. At this moment, he still dared not confirm who resided within Luo Tian’s body, so he deployed the Soul-Sealing Formation to investigate.

“Hail the Sect Leader!” The four Supreme Beings bore ecstatic expressions as they bowed to Luo Tian.

“I must enter seclusion!” A deep voice echoed from Luo Tian, his eyes carrying a touch of age. He glanced at Sha Cangmang and the four Supreme Beings before stepping forward, vanishing from the spot.

“Hmph?” Sha Cangmang’s brow furrowed slightly, his face showing a hint of confusion. Just now, he had deployed the Painful Soul Formation to determine who resided within Luo Tian’s body. However, as soon as the formation activated, Luo Tian vanished from the altar. In such a short time, the Painful Soul Formation could not have detected anything.

“Never mind; regardless of who you are, as long as you lead us to the Transcendence Domain and guide us into the Transcendence Altar, it’s fine. If you refuse, don’t blame me for being ruthless!” Sha Cangmang’s face bore a flicker of killing intent as he gazed downward.

Luo Tian sighed softly, sensing Sha Cangmang’s formation would reveal his identity. Thus, he had slipped away immediately upon appearing and now stood beneath the Qinglong Mountain’s earth.

The reason for his presence here was that within the memories of the Qinglong Sect Leader, he had learned about the Qinglong Sect’s hidden depths beneath the surface. The Qinglong Palace—where the sect’s guardian dragon, Qinglong, had once dwelled—was this place. Even Sha Cangmang could not enter it; only the Sect Leader could.

But since Luo Tian had devoured the Sect Leader’s soul, he was now the Sect Leader himself. He was one of the four who had participated in sealing the Tianyuan Continent.

Luo Tian moved through the earth’s depths, descending three thousand zhang before finally arriving at the entrance of a subterranean palace.

There was no darkness beneath the surface; the entire palace was brilliantly illuminated, its walls adorned with countless gems that made it resemble daylight.

Before the grand palace’s entrance stood two lifelike Qinglong statues, coiled at the gates. The statues radiated an awe-inspiring aura.

Luo Tian felt no hesitation; he could sense the palace held no hostility toward him, and even a faint sense of familiarity from the two Qinglong statues.

Without hesitation, he strode into the palace with a joyful expression, following the memories of the Qinglong Sect Leader to reach a spring that continuously erupted.

A vast pool, untouched by time, its source spilling water into the pool endlessly.

“This must be the life-death spring in the Qinglong Sect Leader’s memories!” Luo Tian extended his hand into the water, a sense of admiration on his face.

“Life and Death Dao!” Luo Tian’s spirit trembled, a joyous expression on his face. He had once witnessed Ke Xinshui’s use of the Life and Death Dao in a ranking battle. Now, sensing the life-death power within the water, he knew this spring contained the essence of the Life and Death Dao.

“Mastering the Life and Death Dao, ascending to the Sixth Source Supreme Being! With this body and the immense soul power from devouring the Qinglong Sect Leader, I should be unafraid of Seventh Source Supreme Beings. Even against Sha Cangmang, I could escape at will!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with sharpness as he leapt into the spring.

“Plop…” Water splashed as Luo Tian entered the spring, and the pool’s water gradually coalesced around him.

Luo Tian closed his eyes, beginning to comprehend the boundless life-death power within the water.

In the Qinglong Sect’s council hall, Sha Cangmang and the four Supreme Beings sat with somewhat grim expressions. No disciples or elders had disturbed them; only they occupied the hall.

“Sect Leader, is this Luo Tian truly the Sect Leader?” An elder spoke, his face filled with doubt as he addressed Sha Cangmang.

The elder’s words prompted the other three to turn their gazes toward Sha Cangmang. After all, this was a matter of great importance; if he were not the Sect Leader, their years of effort would be in vain.

“I don’t know. However, this shouldn’t affect our plan. Remember the binding band on his body? No one else can untie it, but the Sect Leader himself could. So now we must wait for him to emerge from seclusion. If he unties the binding band, then he is the Sect Leader.”

“Of course, if he cannot, I will use the binding band to control him and lead us to the Transcendence Altar. Then I will kill him and reclaim this body!” Sha Cangmang mused, a faint smile on his face.

Upon hearing Sha Cangmang’s words, the four Supreme Beings’ faces brightened. Their tense expressions turned into smiles. If it were as Sha Cangmang said, regardless of whether Luo Tian was the Sect Leader or not, they would be invincible. Now all they needed to do was wait for Luo Tian’s emergence. Then everything would become clear.

“One day… ten days…” Time passed slowly, and before they knew it, a month had gone by. Sha Cangmang and the others had no time for other matters; they merely sat in meditation, waiting.

A month passed, and Luo Tian remained seated within the life-death spring for a month. At this moment, he sat in meditation within the spring, with water still flowing into the pool from its source.

Yet the pool’s water had changed; it surrounded Luo Tian, forming a Taijitu pattern—black on one side and white on the other, creating a cycle.

“Life on one side, death on the other—life and death essence complete!” Luo Tian suddenly opened his eyes, a look of enlightenment on his face. A black and white life-death power emerged from his eyes, eventually condensing into a life-death essence that settled in Luo Tian’s dantian.

The hum of energy surged as Luo Tian completed his life-death essence, and the heavens’ power over Qinglong Sect gathered again, causing the sect’s disciples to stir.

“Someone has ascended to Sixth Source Supreme Being!” A disciple murmured, sensing the overwhelming pressure from the sky. His eyes held anticipation, eager to know who had reached the Supreme Being level.

“Finally emerged!” Sha Cangmang and the four Seven-Source Supreme Beings also smiled, having waited a month for Luo Tian’s emergence.

“Such a powerful aura—even I am somewhat startled!” An elder spoke, gazing at the overwhelming power of the heavens above, his face filled with admiration.

“Hum…” In an instant, a figure appeared in the sky, his face bearing authority as he let the powerful heavenly power flow into his body.

“It’s Luo Tian! Luo Tian has ascended to the Sixth Source Supreme Being!”

“Unsurpassed, Luo Tian! He reached the Sixth Source Supreme Being so quickly!” Qinglong Sect disciples marveled at the sight of Luo Tian, his aura radiating authority.

Sha Cangmang and the four Supreme Beings appeared before Luo Tian as soon as he emerged, waiting for him to absorb the heavenly power.

A quarter of an hour passed silently; Luo Tian’s body emitted a series of thunderous sounds, and he looked at Sha Cangmang with a smile.

“You! Who are you!” Sha Cangmang’s face bore a solemn expression, his gaze filled with complexity as he looked at Luo Tian. Now he truly could not discern Luo Tian’s true identity.

“Who do you think I am? That’s who I am!” Luo Tian gazed at Sha Cangmang and the four Supreme Beings.

At the moment of their mutual gaze, Sha Cangmang’s eyes flashed with intense light, his spirit trembled as a pressure surged toward Luo Tian.

At the same time, the four Supreme Beings’ eyes flickered with killing intent; their hands formed seals, and primal power surged from their bodies, forming a primal power net that enveloped Luo Tian.

Chapter 782: Unbinding the Soul-Chain

Above Qinglong Sect, Luo Tian stood in the sky, gazing at Sha Cangmang and the four Seven-Source Supreme Beings with a faint smile.

Yet Sha Cangmang and the four bore killing intent in their gazes, a powerful pressure and primal power net enveloping Luo Tian.

Seeing the five’s attack, Luo Tian smiled calmly. His body was surrounded by a mist of green energy, and faint dragon roars echoed from his form. Each roar was followed by a streak of green lightning covering Luo Tian’s front, nine-colored halos radiating from his body. Facing the four Supreme Beings’ combined primal power net, he stood unshaken. Sha Cangmang’s pressure was even ignored by Luo Tian.

In an instant, the primal power net enveloped Luo Tian, attempting to bind him.

“Crush…” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered as he felt the primal power from the net. He spoke softly, and his nine-colored halos flared again, illuminating the entire sky.

“What happened? Why are the Sect Leader and four Supreme Beings attacking Luo Tian!” Qinglong Sect disciples gazed at the dazzling nine-colored halos in the sky, their faces filled with confusion.

The word “Crush” was spoken, and the four Seven-Source Supreme Beings’ primal power net emitted thunderous sounds. It shattered instantly upon Luo Tian’s body, dispersing into primal energy that was absorbed by his flesh.

“Qinglong Saint Body—truly terrifying!” The four Supreme Beings’ spirits trembled, their faces filled with disbelief. They were about to strike again when Sha Cangmang raised his hand, emitting a powerful wave like heavenly authority toward Luo Tian.

“I am the Sect Leader!” A deep voice echoed from Luo Tian, causing Sha Cangmang’s attack to pause slightly. His gaze still held doubt as he looked at Luo Tian.

“The Sect Leader, sorry, I’m not entirely sure if you are the Sect Leader. I think it’s better to capture you first!” Sha Cangmang gazed at the golden headband on Luo Tian’s head, his face calm. He had already confirmed that this person was not the Sect Leader.

His primal power gathered again, forming a string of runes that rushed toward Luo Tian’s soul-chain.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with a sneer. If he could fight Sha Cangmang and the four Seven-Source Supreme Beings, he would have already turned on them.

But Luo Tian’s previous actions were to establish authority. Now, seeing the four Supreme Beings’ expressions of shock, he knew his goal had been achieved. He felt the pressure from the soul-chain and let out a light laugh, grabbing the golden headband.

“What is he doing!” The four Seven-Source Supreme Beings’ faces showed surprise as they watched Luo Tian’s actions.

Sha Cangmang, however, ignored them and directly launched the runes into the golden headband. If Luo Tian remained unaffected, there was an 80% chance he was the Sect Leader. Even if not, he had absorbed the Sect Leader’s inheritance and could still lead them to the Transcendence Altar.

As he thought, Sha Cangmang’s primal runes formed a long dragon and rushed into Luo Tian’s headband.

“Why is the Sect Leader treating Luo Tian this way? Isn’t he a direct disciple of the Sect Leader!” Qinglong Sect disciples were confused, murmuring among themselves.

“Soul-Chain!” The Qinglong Sect’s attendants saw the Sect Leader infuse runes into Luo Tian’s headband and bore painful expressions. They had all felt the soul-chain’s power—pain directly affecting the soul, impossible to resist.

But in an instant, Qinglong Sect disciples were stunned; Luo Tian appeared unaffected, his hands forming six primal powers that transformed into runes covering his hands. These runes danced wildly on his hands, tightly grasping the soul-chain already transformed into runes on his head.

“Break!” Luo Tian roared, his hands’ runes rushing into the runes on his head.

A fluctuation spread; the entire world seemed to hear only Luo Tian’s roar. A breaking sound echoed in people’s ears.

“Boom…” The rune dragon on Luo Tian’s head broke apart, and he grasped it in his hand. Qinglong Sect disciples’ faces showed shock.

“What did I just see? The soul-chain was broken by Luo Tian!” Qinglong Sect disciples exclaimed, gazing at the cold-faced man in the sky.

The attendants of Qinglong Sect took deep breaths, their expressions becoming more urgent. They hadn’t expected anyone to break the soul-chain—let alone witness it with their own eyes!

“Boom…” Luo Tian applied slight pressure, and the rune dragon transformed into primal energy that drifted through heaven and earth.

Sha Cangmang’s face flickered with complex emotions before he nodded slightly at the four elder Supreme Beings.

“You truly are the Sect Leader of Qinglong Sect, the one who has been reborn!” Sha Cangmang’s words caused the four Supreme Beings to pause, then a smile appeared on their aged faces.

“Hail the Sect Leader’s return to Qinglong Sect!” The four Seven-Source Supreme Beings, though still doubtful, bowed slightly in reverence to the first Sect Leader.

“No matter if you are or not, since you broke the soul-chain, then… you are the Sect Leader!” Sha Cangmang sighed inwardly.

Whether or not he was the Sect Leader didn’t matter; Qinglong Sect had passed through countless generations. Sha Cangmang and the four Supreme Beings had never met the first Sect Leader, so there was no respect. They merely wished to use the Sect Leader to open the Transcendence Altar, hence this body-stealing. Otherwise, Sha Cangmang would not have allowed the Qinglong Saint Body to be stolen but instead chosen to possess it or cultivate Luo Tian.

Upon hearing Sha Cangmang and the four Supreme Beings’ words, Qinglong Sect disciples and elders were stunned, gazing at the young Luo Tian in the sky.

As for the person before them, it didn’t matter who he was; as long as he could open the Transcendence Altar, it wouldn’t be a problem. However, Sha Cangmang and the four Supreme Beings wished for the Sect Leader’s return to be within a controllable range, stronger but not too much. Now it seemed smooth sailing.

“Body-stealing! Luo Tian was body-stealed!” Sha Cangmang’s words were like a bomb, causing a stir among Qinglong Sect disciples and elders.

“Body-stealing! The Sect Leader has body-stealed Luo Tian!” Qinglong Sect attendants’ faces bore disbelief as they gazed at the sky.

Luo Tian, a disciple who had only arrived at Qinglong Sect two years ago, had risen like the brightest star in Qinglong Sect. Yet now he had become a victim of body-stealing.

“Is the Sect Leader’s action too…” Qinglong Sect disciples and elders gazed at Sha Cangmang and the four Supreme Beings with complex expressions.

This was different from their image of the Sect Leader and the four Supreme Beings. Luo Tian had contributed to Qinglong Sect, especially leading it to victory in the ranking battle—why should he end up like this?

The attendants’ gazes were even more direct, their eyes filled with resentment toward Sha Cangmang. Luo Tian held a high status among them, almost like their spiritual pillar. Now that he had been body-stealed, it was as if their spiritual pillar had collapsed, and a powerful resentment surged within them, forming an invisible storm that swept through Qinglong Sect.

“Hmph?” Sensing the resentment, Sha Cangmang’s brow furrowed slightly. He raised his hand and subdued the thick spiritual energy, sneering: “Don’t you all greet the Qinglong Sect’s first Sect Leader!”

The overwhelming pressure of an Eight-Source Supreme Being swept over Qinglong Sect, causing the disciples to tremble slightly. They gazed at Luo Tian in the sky: “Hail the first Sect Leader!”

A unified voice echoed above Qinglong Sect, shaking the heavens and sweeping across the entire Qinglong Continent.

The disciples and elders of Qinglong Sect knew that from today on, there was no longer a direct disciple of the Sect Leader or the genius Luo Tian. Instead, there was the first Sect Leader himself—once a formidable master who had dominated the Four Sacred Star Domains.

“Thank you all for your efforts. As the first Sect Leader of Qinglong Sect, I will fully commit myself!” Luo Tian smiled and addressed Sha Cangmang and the others.

At the same time, a thunderous sound echoed from within the black cauldron—a dark spear shot into the sky, circling Luo Tian before gently landing in his hand. A small black cauldron also floated up, settling on Luo Tian’s shoulder.

The Dragon-Splitting Spear and the Painful Soul Cauldron were now Luo Tian’s only remaining items; all others had been melted within the black cauldron.

The disciples and attendants of Qinglong Sect watched this scene, their faces filled with nostalgia as they gazed at Luo Tian in the sky.

Upon hearing Luo Tian’s confirmation, Sha Cangmang and the four Supreme Beings smiled, their gazes toward Luo Tian becoming gentler.

“Haha! With the first Sect Leader’s return, Qinglong Sect’s strength will surely surpass others!”

“The first Sect Leader has just returned. Allow me to introduce you to the situation of Qinglong Sect and the Four Sacred Star Domains over these years!” The four Supreme Beings spoke to Luo Tian, their gazes filled with friendliness.

“This person is no ordinary foe; he must not be provoked. He managed to seize this Qinglong Saint Body from those souls. If he is not the Sect Leader, then he must be terrifying. If he truly aids Qinglong Sect, it would be a great asset!” Sha Cangmang mused inwardly.

Beyond the Qinglong Continent, Ke ZhenTian and Jin Yongsi exchanged glances, their faces filled with displeasure.

“Who is this person? He doesn’t seem to be the first Sect Leader of Qinglong Sect, but he possesses the abilities of a first Sect Leader!” Jin Yongsi spoke, his gaze heavy.

“It’s probably not the first Sect Leader of Qinglong Sect. If that old man had appeared with such strength, he wouldn’t be a Sixth Source Supreme Being! A mere Sixth Source Supreme Being isn’t worth our effort. However, if he truly can open the Transcendence Altar, it would be a good thing!” Ke ZhenTian mused for a moment before speaking.

Their faces bore smiles, and their figures blurred before vanishing into the endless stars.

Chapter 783: Summoning Sima Qiong

Within Qinglong Sect, Luo Tian was led by a disciple to a grand palace. The entire hall occupied nearly one-tenth of Qinglong Sect, slightly smaller than Sha Cangmang’s residence. If not closely observed, it resembled a small town.

Pavilions and towers stood proudly, their grandeur unmatched. After passing through several pavilions, a towering building stood before them, seemingly reaching the heavens. Standing at its peak allowed one to see half of the Qinglong Continent.

“Hail the first Sect Leader! This is the residence prepared for you!” The disciple bowed, his gaze filled with reverence.

Luo Tian marveled at the buildings as he entered. A series of beautiful voices echoed in his vision, leaving him momentarily dazzled. Whether it was Sha Cangmang’s intention or the four Supreme Beings’, among the crowd, only one-fifth were men, with the rest all women.

Luo Tian even noticed two One-Source Supreme Beings among the front ranks, prompting a bitter smile from him.

“Should the first Sect Leader wish, these women could all be his!” The disciple spoke with a jealous expression.

“This is much better than my previous treatment as Sha Cangmang’s disciple!” Luo Tian mused, gazing at the figures before him.

He recalled the memories of the Qinglong Sect Leader who had loved women, with a harem of thousands.

After a brief surprise, Luo Tian’s expression returned to normal as he sat cross-legged in the hall. He played with a storage ring, which contained several thousand souls—this allowed him to know that within this small town, if anyone harbored ill intent, he didn’t need to suppress them himself. A single thought could decide their fates.

Though this seemed excessive, killing these people was as easy as slaughtering chickens now. Yet it reflected Sha Cangmang’s respect for Luo Tian, a gesture of sincerity.

“Come here and tell me the current state of Qinglong Sect!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered slightly. Though he already knew the situation, he still asked symbolically.

Two One-Source Supreme Beings bore a suitable smile and approached Luo Tian, introducing the current state of Qinglong Sect.

After a symbolic listening session, Luo Tian closed his eyes and ceased speaking. The thousands of people in the hall bore anxious expressions, especially the female cultivators—some with complex emotions, others with anticipation, waiting for Luo Tian to speak.

“Everyone may leave!” A deep voice echoed in the silent hall, causing people’s faces to show surprise—especially the two female cultivators.
