“Not satisfied? If not, we can continue playing in the third trial!” Luo Tian’s face carried a cold edge. These people had been bothering him relentlessly, and he was now thoroughly fed up.

“The third trial—there’s still the third trial. This country bumpkin surely has no good martial arts skills. The third trial allows for killing; if we kill this boy, it’ll still let Zuo Qiu Ming choose me for the recommendation slot. Or perhaps we can directly catch the elders’ attention!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, others’ faces bore waves of killing intent. If they killed Luo Tian in the third trial, his brilliance in the first would be meaningless.

“Alright, the second trial begins!” Before Luo Tian’s words had even faded, Ke Zhenghao smiled and spoke again.

Upon hearing Ke Zhenghao’s words, the other elders waved their hands. A series of divine lights shot forth from their palms, colliding with a resounding crash to form a golden mirror suspended above the vast battlefield.

Chapter 1802: Everyone, descend.

“Hm?” Luo Tian’s face showed confusion as he turned to gaze at Zuo Qiu Ming and Xue Yushan standing there. He had just begun to assist Long Youlan, but someone had arrived before him.

Zuo Qiu Ming gave Luo Tian an imperceptible nod, and Luo Tian’s face broke into a faint smile. This pressure was nothing to him.

“Good to have help!” Luo Tian mused inwardly, his gaze sweeping over the others. Their postures were twisted but they gritted their teeth in endurance, though numbers dwindled constantly.

“One hour and a half!” Ke Zhenghao’s face bore a smile as he turned to the over five hundred remaining on the Tianlong battlefield, speaking softly.

“Plop…” As Ke Zhenghao’s words ended, someone collapsed in exhaustion, breathing heavily with relief.

Yet a portion stood proudly, unmoving. Zhang Xing, Qian Luofeng, Yuan Tianjiao—these sought brilliance, to be noticed by the eight formidable figures. Only then could they have a chance at entering the inner sect!

“Indeed, extending time has brought more people than before!” Li Changfeng smiled, watching Luo Tian and others still standing. The ones who had fallen were but cannon fodder for the battle of heaven.

“Hum…” Ke Zhenghao and others clearly understood this unspoken rule. Their auras surged again, pressing upon the remaining over a hundred.

“Roar…” As pressure descended, someone howled. This force threatened even early-stage Celestial Immortals.

In an instant, many fell, their faces etched with resentment. Only Long Youlan remained among the Celestial Immortals.

Pressure kept intensifying, and more Celestial Immortals fell. The battlefield’s people felt immense pressure; even Luo Tian’s body bent slightly.

“Fifteen…” Yet Luo Tian still had the leisure to count others’ numbers.

“The pressure is terrifying!” Those who had been sent down gazed at those still standing with fear.

“My heavens, there’s a Daoist realm!” Soon people noticed Long Youlan standing on the battlefield.

“What kind of prodigy is this? She withstands pressure that even early-stage Celestial Immortals can’t endure!”

“Wait—look who’s beside her!” People then noticed Luo Tian holding Long Youlan’s hand, sensing waves radiating from Luo Tian to her.

“Is that Luo Tian? He alone bears the pressure of two!” People were stunned.

“To bear two’s pressure—what use is that? A weak Daoist realm dares stand with me!” Zhang Xing sneered, sweat streaming down his face as pressure mounted.

As Zhang Xing sneered, an invisible wave surged toward Long Youlan. Clearly, he aimed to send her down—indirectly targeting Luo Tian, hoping he’d fall with him.

“Hm?” Luo Tian instantly felt the wave approaching Long Youlan, his eyes cold.

Meanwhile, others noticed Zhang Xing’s actions and saw an opportunity to undermine Luo Tian, making him look foolish.

Suddenly, the Tianlong battlefield roared with waves. Invisible forces surged toward Luo Tian.

“Interesting!” Li Changfeng smiled, watching Luo Tian’s unexpected actions.

“You never learn, do you?” Luo Tian held Long Youlan’s hand. She trembled, wanting to give up—she had already passed the trial—but found Luo Tian still holding her hand.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed cold as he faced the waves. Yet when he sensed a chill within them, his expression darkened. He gazed at the black-cloaked Gu Qiansnow.

“Will you attack me too? Why?” Luo Tian felt a surge of resentment. Though he knew something might be wrong with Gu Qiansnow, her attack still unsettled him.

“Get out…” Luo Tian roared, invisible waves sweeping outward. His gaze was icy toward all.

“Crack…” Invisible collisions echoed across the battlefield, waves radiating from Luo Tian’s body outward.

“Rustle…” Like a storm, collisions echoed on the battlefield. The waves from the prodigies attacking Luo Tian vanished instantly.

Wind blew, rustling everyone’s robes. All faces paled slightly.

“Since you want to play, I’ll play with you today!” Luo Tian stood straight, one hand holding Long Youlan’s. Invisible waves surged again from his body.

“Just you!” Zhang Xing and others sneered, disbelieving that Luo Tian alone could withstand their auras.

“Hum…” The humming echoed. Next, Luo Tian’s aura surged forth, sweeping over them all.

“Get out!” Dozens of prodigies roared. Their auras surged, and invisible dragons clashed with Luo Tian’s aura.

“Press!” Seeing them withstand pressure yet still fight, Ke Zhenghao and others felt their pride wounded. They raised hands, pressing downward.

“Damn!” Next moment, everyone’s faces changed abruptly. Their bodies cracked with a sound, bending but still enduring.

“Get down!” As they endured immense pressure, a cold voice echoed across the Tianlong battlefield.

“How?!” People saw Luo Tian, who had been attacked before, slowly moving his body and punching the battlefield’s ground.

“Crack…” The massive Tianlong battlefield echoed with thunderous sounds. A powerful aura burst forth, surging toward Zhang Xing and others.

“Roar!” Zhang Xing’s group howled, struggling to break free from pressure but being crushed.

“Peng…” Next moment, Luo Tian’s unstoppable aura struck their bodies.

Each figure seemed hit by something, flying backward. Yet before they could escape a丈, they were crushed to the ground by Ke Zhenghao and Zuo Qiu Ming’s pressure.

With dozens falling, only three figures remained on the battlefield: Luo Tian, Long Youlan, and a black-cloaked Gu Qiansnow.

Gu Qiansnow’s face bore confusion. She had instinctively attacked Luo Tian and Long Youlan earlier, but she didn’t know others had been defeated—only she hadn’t.

“Impossible!” Ke Zhenghao and others marveled. How could this boy withstand their pressure?

“The trial is over?” Luo Tian held Long Youlan’s hand. Even a late-stage Celestial Immortal couldn’t kill him with aura alone—Luo Tian was the Epoch Master of the Nine Realms, and his mastery over auras surpassed these people.

“End it!” Li Changfeng smiled, watching Luo Tian. No matter how he did it, Luo Tian was extraordinary.

“This boy’s body—our Iron Gate will take him!” A lazy elder of the Iron Gate stared at Luo Tian, eyes gleaming.

Three major sects each had their specialties. The Heaven Gate focused on cultivation, the Earth Gate on soul essence, and the Iron Gate on bodies. Seeing Luo Tian’s brilliance, the Iron Gate elder wouldn’t let him go.

“Old Song, wait until after the trial to recruit,” Zhao Tiancheng smiled.

“Damn!” As pressure lessened, Zhang Xing’s group glared at Luo Tian. They hadn’t defeated him and had even let him steal the spotlight, drawing attention from the Earth Gate and Iron Gate.

“Not satisfied? If not, we can continue playing in the third trial!” Luo Tian’s face bore coldness. These people had been bothering him relentlessly, and he was now thoroughly fed up.

“The third trial—there’s still the third trial. This country bumpkin surely has no good martial arts skills. The third trial allows for killing; if we kill this boy, it’ll still let Zuo Qiu Ming choose me for the recommendation slot. Or perhaps we can directly catch the elders’ attention!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, others bore waves of killing intent. If they killed Luo Tian in the third trial, his brilliance in the first would be meaningless.

“Alright, the second trial begins!” Before Luo Tian’s words had even faded, Ke Zhenghao smiled and spoke again.

Upon hearing Ke Zhenghao’s words, other elders waved their hands. Divine lights shot forth from their palms, colliding with a resounding crash to form a golden mirror suspended above the vast battlefield.

Chapter 1803: Competition

“Come on, this trial is much simpler. Just push your soul essence as far forward as you can!” Ke Zhenghao addressed Luo Tian and others.

“This trial I’ll definitely shine!” Each prodigy’s face bore excitement, secretly gathering strength. They had let Luo Tian steal the spotlight earlier and resolved to catch the elders’ or even the master’s attention this time.

Luo Tian and Long Youlan stood before the massive golden mirror, marveling at how straightforward the Heaven Gate’s recruitment was.

“Reaching five hundred zhang qualifies. Begin!” Ke Zhenghao spoke again, announcing the start.

“Hum…” As Ke Zhenghao’s words ended, over five hundred people placed their hands on the golden mirror. At the same time, gray light points appeared at its base.

“What a strange space!” Luo Tian felt himself in an odd state upon touching the mirror. His soul essence seemed to be in a space, while his physical body still moved normally.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian marveled, gray energy surged rapidly.

“Ten zhang… one hundred zhang…” In an instant, five hundred soul essences reached a hundred zhang.

“Hum…” Luo Tian felt it unusually simple. His soul essence far surpassed early-stage Celestial Immortals.

“Soul essence represents talent. A hundred zhang is first-grade; reaching five hundred zhang means their soul essences are fifth-grade仙魂, indicating great potential to reach late-stage Celestial Immortals!” Zhao Tiancheng observed the gray columns on the mirror. The Earth Gate focused on soul essence, so Zhao Tiancheng cared deeply about this trial.

“Two hundred zhang… three hundred zhang…” Soon, Luo Tian and others reached three hundred zhang.

But after three hundred zhang, some couldn’t endure. The gray columns slowed, some even halting at three hundred zhang.

“Four hundred zhang… five hundred zhang…” Zhang Xing and other prodigies’ soul essences quickly reached five hundred zhang.

“Such many people?” Zhang Xing frowned. He could also see the gray columns above him. Though he was first to break five hundred zhang, some followed closely.

“Trash—your soul essence will never match mine!” Zhang Xing sneered, but after breaking five hundred zhang, his speed only increased.

“Seven hundred zhang… seventh-grade仙魂, late-stage Celestial Immortal!” Zhao Tiancheng’s eyes lit up, gazing at Zhang Xing.

“There are a few promising talents!” Li Changfeng smiled, though not overly concerned. It meant potential for late-stage Celestial Immortals.

“Eight hundred zhang… I’m coming!” Zhang Xing’s eyes flashed with blue light, roaring. His column suddenly changed color, surging to eight hundred zhang, leaving everyone’s eyes wide.

“Late-stage Celestial Immortal!” Zhao Tiancheng stared at Zhang Xing, recalling his own level in the Earth Gate.

“Haha, what can you compare to me?” Zhang Xing laughed, watching the columns slowly rising. He glanced at Luo Tian and Qian Luofeng.

Zhang Xing seemed to burst forth, reaching eight hundred zhang before stopping. Others remained at six hundred zhang.

“Haha, Zhang Xing, this trial won’t let you shine alone!” Qian Luofeng smiled, his hands moving. His speed surged, breaking away from the group to chase Zhang Xing’s eight hundred zhang.

After reaching six hundred zhang, only a few columns remained. One was Luo Tian’s, one Gu Qiansnow’s, another Yuan Tianjiao’s, and a gray-cloaked youth with a blood mask. Also present were Wan Youlan and Du Changtian.

As for Long Youlan, with Zuo Qiu Ming’s help, she reached six hundred zhang but stopped.

“Luo Tian brother, you can do it!” Long Youlan encouraged Luo Tian. She knew he was a refining master, so his soul essence was exceptionally strong.

“Little sister, I’m not up to it this time!” Zhang Xing looked at Luo Tian with arrogance.

“Hum…” As Zhang Xing mocked Luo Tian, Qian Luofeng’s soul essence reached eight hundred zhang and stopped.

“Another talent who can reach late-stage Celestial Immortal!” Li Changfeng smiled, feeling this generation’s recruitment quality was high. Though the first trial had some hiccups, it proved their bodies weren’t weak.

“Can they break eight hundred zhang?” Zhang Xing and Qian Luofeng looked at Luo Tian’s group with arrogance.

“Maybe someone can break eight hundred zhang, but that kid definitely can’t. Our sect has soul essence cultivation methods; we’ve nurtured our souls with special techniques. Where would he get that? I bet he doesn’t even know his soul grade!” Zhang Xing sneered.

“Luo Tian brother is the best! He’s a second-grade refining master!” Long Youlan rebutted loudly.

“Haha, a second-grade refining master—our sect values that. But their soul grades are only sixth-grade仙魂!” Hearing Long Youlan, Zhang Xing and Qian Luofeng looked down.

“Those remaining have reached eight hundred zhang!” As Zhang Xing scoffed at Long Youlan, people below the Tianlong battlefield erupted in chatter, silencing Zhang Xing and Qian Luofeng’s smiles.

“How?” Zhang Xing and Qian Luofeng stared in disbelief at the six columns rising skyward.

“Ah, that’s Yuan Tianjiao from the震仙门. They failed in the battle for heaven before, right?” Li Changfeng seemed to recall something, speaking softly.

“Though they failed in the battle for heaven, their standards were there. Their disciples are naturally good. But I’m surprised those geniuses from several cities, who weren’t nurtured by sects, still reached eight hundred zhang. These people will surely achieve much with a little polishing!” Li Changfeng spoke again. Few in the lower three realms would receive such praise from him.

“Master Qiu once reached eight hundred and fifty zhang!” Xue Yushan smiled, recalling how Zuo Qiu Ming had surpassed Ke Zhenghao and others by fifty zhang.

“Damn!” Wan Youlan and Du Changtian’s faces paled. Their columns halted at seven hundred ten zhang—their limit.

“Don’t overtake, don’t overtake. At least don’t let that Luo Tian overtake!” Zhang Xing and Qian Luofeng prayed inwardly.

But soon, they slumped. Their faces looked like withered eggplants, eyes wide in disbelief at Luo Tian’s group.

Four columns, moving slowly but steadily surpassing their seven hundred forty and seven hundred fifty zhang. They marched toward eight hundred zhang.

“Hey, I ask—what grade is eight hundred zhang?” Luo Tian asked Zhang Xing and Qian Luofeng.

Hearing this, their faces turned red. They had mocked Luo Tian earlier but were now surpassed by him. This question made them extremely annoyed.

“Ninth-grade仙魂!”

“But don’t get too excited. Breaking eight hundred zhang isn’t easy!” Zhang Xing sneered.

“Damn it!” Soon, Zhang Xing wished to hit himself. Four columns had already broken eight hundred zhang.

“Four, ninth-grade仙魂!” Everyone’s faces showed shock. They gazed at Luo Tian’s group.

“Nine hundred ten zhang… nine hundred twenty zhang…” People watched Luo Tian’s group, murmuring their progress.

“I am Yuan Tianjiao. I lost once to you. Now, I’ll win!” Yuan Tianjiao roared, his eyes suddenly turning pale blue.

“Hum…” A water-blue column rose with Yuan Tianjiao’s burst, quickly reaching the eight hundred fifty zhang mark of Zuo Qiu Ming.

Meanwhile, Gu Qiansnow and the blood-masked figure burst forth. Their eyes bore solemnity; black and red columns approached Yuan Tianjiao’s soul column.

“Nine hundred eighty… nine hundred ninety…” Everyone erupted. Even Ke Zhenghao and others overseeing the golden mirror looked shocked.

Zhang Xing and Qian Luofeng nearly wept. They had thought reaching seven hundred zhang was their peak.

“Nine hundred zhang!” As people gasped, it seemed like a final sprint. Yuan Tianjiao, Gu Qiansnow, and the blood-masked man’s soul essence in that special space burned out completely, halting at nine hundred ten zhang.

“True Immortal mid-stage!” Li Changfeng, Zhao Tiancheng, and Iron Gate’s Old Song stared at Gu Qiansnow. Though they were still early-stage Celestial Immortals, their soul essences were strong enough to reach True Immortal mid-stage.

“Moreover, their souls have infinite potential—True Immortal mid-stage might not be their peak!” Li Changfeng spoke softly.

Chapter 1804: What Grade Is This?

Hearing Li Changfeng’s words, people showed shock. They felt the three’s talent was beyond limits, gazing at Gu Qiansnow with reverence. Though they were still early-stage Celestial Immortals, their futures would surely make them great powers.

“Long time since such a talent appeared!” Zhao Tiancheng and Old Song’s eyes gleamed. They secretly pondered how to recruit these three into their factions.

“Still, it hasn’t reached the peak. Once, Xuan Dan participated in soul essence testing and broke through a thousand zhang, achieving the rare tenth-grade仙魂.” Li Changfeng spoke softly, recalling their past competition. They had fiercely competed then, but Xuan Dan overshadowed them.

“This record—no one can break it. At least the lower three realms have no one who can!” Li Changfeng spoke softly.

“Wait, there’s still someone who hasn’t burst forth yet!” People noticed a gray column moving slowly—Luo Tian.

“Almost there. Don’t make too much of a show!” Luo Tian mused, his column halting at eight hundred ninety zhang.

“Eight hundred ninety zhang. If he bursts forth, he might reach nine hundred fifty zhang—super talent!” People sighed, watching Luo Tian.

“Stop… stop…” But as people thought Luo Tian would take first again, they noticed his soul column had stopped.

“Just because he reached this far is already good!” Zhang Xing and Qian Luofeng said with sourness. They knew that this country bumpkin had become the brightest star, while they were like heaven and earth apart.

Even their killing intent vanished. They knew the three major sects’ elders wouldn’t let this prodigy die.

“Nine-grade仙魂!” Zhang Xing finally submitted, his head drooping as he spoke with despair.

“Nine hundred eleven… nine hundred thirteen…” Luo Tian smiled faintly. The gray column still climbed, quickly surpassing Yuan Tianjiao and Gu Qiansnow.

“Damn it!” Yuan Tianjiao’s face darkened. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian’s soul essence to easily surpass his.

“Nine hundred sixty… nine hundred eighty…” Time passed slowly. Everyone on the Tianlong battlefield and below held their breath, watching Luo Tian stand calmly.

“Nine hundred ninety-nine…” The gray column seemed to reach its limit, stopping at nine hundred ninety-nine zhang. Luo Tian felt his soul essence in that strange space was nearly exhausted.

“Push forward!” Next moment, Luo Tian roared. His remaining soul essence burned fiercely toward the mirror’s peak.

“One thousand zhang!” Someone spoke, eyes burning with excitement. They couldn’t speak as the column reached a thousand zhang.

“Xuan Dan Master’s record!” Li Changfeng suddenly stood, eyes filled with excitement, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Hum…” However, more shocking events occurred. As Luo Tian reached the peak, the golden mirror凝聚 by Zuo Qiu Ming and others trembled.

“Crack…” Next moment, under people’s eyes, the golden mirror cracked. Cracks spread rapidly across its surface before shattering into fragments, vanishing from sight.

“This…!” Everyone was stunned. Never had they seen such a situation—shattering the testing mirror.

“What grade is this? Terrifying!” Li Changfeng’s face showed shock. This expression hadn’t graced him in years.

“We must recruit him into our sect! Definitely, this talent may reach True Immortal peak!” Zhao Tiancheng and Old Song’s eyes were resolute, burning with heat toward Luo Tian.

“Hey, I ask—what grade is this…” Luo Tian scratched his head, gazing at Zhang Xing and Qian Luofeng.

“Sir Luo, I was wrong!” Seeing Luo Tian gaze at him, Zhang Xing’s face looked like crying. He spoke with a sob.

“Luo Sir, you are the vast star. Please spare me! I had no eyes to recognize your talent before. From now on, I’ll follow you as a servant. Please accept me!” Zhang Xing bowed to Luo Tian, eyes filled with reverence.

“Zhang Xing, why are you so lacking in ambition!” Qian Luofeng’s face changed upon hearing Zhang Xing, eyes filled with anger.

“But, Luo Sir, I also think the same! My admiration for you is like endless rivers, flowing endlessly. Why do I feel this way when I see you? It’s like finding sunlight in clouds, making me follow you!” Qian Luofeng spoke loudly, his voice resolute, gazing at Luo Tian.

“What the hell…” Hearing Zhang Xing and Qian Luofeng, Luo Tian was stunned. Others were too.

“Good prodigies—prodigies don’t show their faces, yet they lack integrity!” People watched Zhang Xing and Qian Luofeng’s drastic change, secretly despising them.

“Son, I definitely didn’t misjudge you. Join our Earth Gate! I’ll double my previous offer!” Zhao Tiancheng laughed, eyes filled with joy, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Master Zhao, did you meet this boy before?” Hearing Zhao Tiancheng’s words, Old Song’s face slightly changed. Even Li Changfeng’s eyes narrowed.

“Haha, where, where? I just passed through his city and saved him once. Haha!” Zhao Tiancheng laughed, though his words were humble, everyone could see his pride.

“Also, Li Changfeng Master, I advise you not to think about it. Our sect once wanted to kill this boy,” Zhao Tiancheng laughed, his pride evident.

“What? There was such a thing?” Hearing Zhao Tiancheng’s words, Li Changfeng’s face darkened.

“Zhenghao, no need for you anymore. Go investigate!” Li Changfeng’s eyes were cold as he spoke to Ke Zhenghao.

“Yes, Master!” Ke Zhenghao’s body trembled. He knew Li Changfeng was truly angry. Offending such a prodigy, and not knowing—this would surely bring trouble to the Heaven Gate.

“Son, if you join our Iron Gate, Master Zhao’s gifts we can also match. Moreover, I can personally arrange my granddaughter to marry you!” Old Song spoke after hearing Li Changfeng and Zhao Tiancheng. He bit his teeth, speaking loudly.

“Crazy! These masters and elders are crazy!” Everyone inhaled sharply, gazing at Li Changfeng and the three. They hadn’t expected these great figures to so fiercely compete for Luo Tian.

“Extremely Rare True Immortal Soul Essence…” Others didn’t know, but Li Changfeng and the three old men knew. After breaking a thousand zhang, what talent was this? Not only could it reach True Immortal peak but perhaps even become a Dao King. Though the chances were slim, this ensured Luo Tian’s future achievements would surpass others greatly.

“This brother…” Among these people, the most excited was Zuo Qiu Ming and his wife. The more Luo Tian was valued by others, the better it was for them.

“Elders, are we proceeding to the next trial?” As Li Changfeng and Zhao Tiancheng extended olive branches, Luo Tian spoke softly.

“Hm…” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Li Changfeng was surprised. His eyes showed contemplation. That moment, Luo Tian felt slightly off.

“Hum…” As Li Changfeng was stunned, a figure flew from the Tianlong Mountain. Ke Zhenghao’s face bore reverence as he held two figures, appearing in people’s sight.

“Master… Master…” The two fell to the ground, immediately sensing something was wrong. They saw Li Changfeng and didn’t know what had happened to bring the master here.

“Your names?” Li Changfeng sneered, face filled with authority. He mentally cursed the two fools.

“Disciple Lu Potian!”

“Disciple Xu Hongtao!” The two spoke, their voices trembling. Their eyes then saw Luo Tian standing nearby.

Chapter 1805: Battle Strength Competition

Lu Potian and Xu Hongtao were stunned. Why had the master’s disciples come to fetch them?

“Master, they were responsible for Longyin City!” Ke Zhenghao spoke softly, then gazed at Lu Potian and Xu Hongtao.

“Hmph. What did you two do in Longyin City? Did you want to kill?” Li Changfeng spoke softly, gazing at Lu Potian and Xu Hongtao.

Upon hearing Li Changfeng’s words, the two faced his authority. They dared not utter a word and trembled as they recounted their actions.

“Kill them!” Li Changfeng spoke softly, without hesitation. The two hadn’t even finished speaking before he ordered Ke Zhenghao.

“Peng… Peng…” Two clouds of blood rose, splattering onto the Tianlong battlefield.

“Continue!” Li Changfeng seemed to have done something trivial, speaking to everyone.

“Next is the final trial. Those who passed the first two trials come forward to draw lots. Defeat your opponent, and you’ll enter the outer sect. Those who reach the end will receive rewards. We may also take you as disciples. Once you reach late-stage Celestial Immortal, you can participate in the inner sect’s trial!” Ke Zhenghao spoke softly, then waved his hand. A series of light beams appeared above everyone.

The remaining over two hundred people bore excitement. They were just one step away from entering the Heaven Gate. This trial relied on strength and luck. If lucky, they’d draw a weak opponent and win—becoming an outer sect disciple.

Conversely, if unlucky and drew a prodigy, they’d have to accept their fate.

“Tianmen, I’m definitely in!” Next moment, figures soared upward. Luo Tian and Long Youlan also flew toward the light balls.

Luo Tian grabbed one. For him, these were trivial. Defeating one meant outer sect membership. Then with Zuo Qiu Ming’s recommendation, he’d directly enter the inner sect.

“Ninety-nine.” Luo Tian looked at the ball in his hand. A number appeared—according to rules, his opponent’s number was one hundred and eighty-eight.

Next moment, the ball shattered. Waves surged over Luo Tian’s body. His body was lifted by the waves. Others were the same. The sky filled with prodigies appearing before their opponents.

Luo Tian saw his opponent—unluckily, it was Du Changtian, the one he had clashed with earlier in Tianlong City.

“Luo Tian!” Du Changtian also saw Luo Tian. In their mutual gaze, Du Changtian’s face slightly changed but soon bore a wild look.

“Previously you pushed me back, but now you won’t have such an opportunity!” Du Changtian thought of Luo Tian’s background. If he didn’t directly clash with Luo Tian’s body and soul, but just fought martial arts, he might have a chance.
