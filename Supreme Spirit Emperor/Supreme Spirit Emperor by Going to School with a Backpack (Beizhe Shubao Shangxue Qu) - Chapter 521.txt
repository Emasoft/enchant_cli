“Indeed, this is the Star River Estate. Compared to the Ascension Dragon Sect, it's leagues ahead!” Luo Tian said with admiration, for this was his first time seeing so many Star River Estate disciples.

Moreover, these were merely the Ye family members. Among them were youths, middle-aged individuals, and elders; even those at the initial stage of True Immortal had many.

However, Luo Tian knew that most among these people would not be allowed into the Washing Star Pool, for only the younger generation had the privilege.

Among these people, several caught Luo Tian's attention—four men and one woman, standing like stars surrounding the moon. Even when they saw Ye Liangchen arrive, their eyes held contempt.

“Let me show you this time!”

“If the Celestial Pole is taken by someone else in the Washing Star Pool, what face do you have left?” Ye Hong stood among the crowd, his eyes filled with resentment as he gazed at Ye Liangchen.

“Everyone, today marks the opening of the Washing Star Pool for our Star River Estate. Unlike before, after discussion with the elders, there are some minor rules to follow for entry into the Washing Star Pool. However, it won't hinder your competition,” an elder spoke, his eyes filled with kindness as he looked at Luo Tian and the other youths.

“Competition within the Washing Star Pool is inevitable, so to prevent injuries among you, this time weapons are not allowed inside the Washing Star Pool!” The elder spoke, and the crowd nodded in agreement.

“Indeed, the elders have thought of everything!” People began to speak, praising the elders.

“Without those divine artifacts, Luo Tian is doomed!” Several Star River Estate geniuses' eyes flashed with coldness as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“Do you think I’ve lost my divine artifacts and can’t kill you?” Luo Tian smiled all along, from the moment he entered the crowd, he felt a strong killing intent. Among these was some coming from those most watched.

The Daoist Disciple of Star River Estate, if Luo Tian hadn’t appeared, it would have been one among these. Thus, even without the elders' orders, these geniuses would find a way to kill Luo Tian for the Daoist Disciple position.

“Ye Chen is in seclusion and won’t participate in this Washing Star Pool. Therefore, we must target Luo Tian. I want to see if he’s as strong as the rumors say! A fool calling himself the top among True Immortals!” Several elites looked coldly.

A death trap, for others it would be certain doom. But for Luo Tian, it was nothing.

“Open the Heavens!” As people clamored, a voice of authority echoed through heaven and earth. The sky above cracked open, and a surge of gray energy flowed from the fissure.

Star patterns drifted, flowing into the sky's rift, stabilizing the wild void and forming a passage before everyone’s eyes.

“The Washing Star Pool is open. The cultivation treasures within depend on your own fortune. If anyone obtains the Celestial Pole, they will be transported back to Star River Estate. Now is the time to enter!” The authoritative voice echoed again.

As the voice finished, five long rainbows shot into the sky—those previously noticed by Luo Tian. They rushed toward the cracked heavens.

Behind them, other Ye family youths with eligibility also rose, their eyes filled with excitement as they rushed into the fissure.

“Damn it! We haven’t moved yet, but you’ve already acted. You’re giving us no face!” Ye Liangchen roared, his eyes filled with displeasure as he gazed at the five figures flying into the sky.

“Can’t you hold back?” Luo Tian smiled, then rushed into the heavens alongside Ye Liangchen.

As each figure entered, the fissure in the sky slowly closed, leaving only a few figures standing on the ground.

The kind elder waved his hand, and a curtain appeared above Star River Estate. The sky darkened as the vast starry expanse revealed itself to people's eyes.

“Is this beyond the Immortal realm?” People’s faces showed shock as they gazed at the vast starry expanse revealed by the curtain.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian and others also exited the gray passage, appearing beneath the starry sky. Their faces showed astonishment.

“A small world!” As Luo Tian appeared, he understood the space he was in. His mind was amazed.

“The ancestors of the Ye family must have been a supreme strength to carve out such a small world within the Immortal realm's strict rules.

“Have we left the Immortal realm?” Someone exclaimed, as many Ye family youths gazed at the vast starry expanse, their minds trembling.

Beneath the stars were countless stars of various colors, making the starry expanse unusually beautiful.

“Not domain outside, but a small world. It must be one carved out by the Ye family ancestors!” One person spoke softly, his voice filled with admiration.

“Qiu Qian Di!” People looked at the speaker and focused on that young man.

Qiu Qian Di was not a Ye family member, but after entering Star River Estate, he had shown his brilliance and gained the estate's attention. Upon investigation, it was discovered that this person was one who had ascended.

Qiu Qian Di was also taken as a son-in-law by the Ye family and held a high position within it.

“Each of these stars holds fortune. Go find your own!” Qiu Qian Di addressed the crowd, and soon groups formed around him, obviously wanting to find fortune with Qiu Qian Di.

“An ascended person. No wonder his aura is so strong. But whether he's an ally or foe remains to be seen!” Luo Tian muttered, then gazed at the vast starry expanse. He soon noticed a particularly bright star in the distance, constantly emitting auroras.

“That must be the Celestial Pole. Brother Tian, let's go!” Ye Liangchen’s eyes glowed with excitement as he gazed at the dazzling star.

“You go. Until you claim the Celestial Pole, you are safe. I suppose they all know that without you, certain restrictions can't be opened. They will wait until you open the barriers before acting. I'll check if anyone can't control themselves and attack me first!” Luo Tian smiled, looking at the people around him.

“Fine. Brother Tian, you can also check other stars for something suitable for you. And the fortune in this Washing Star Pool is quite good!” Ye Liangchen nodded, as breaking restrictions would take time. Luo Tian knew he could still arrive in time.

As they spoke, Ye Liangchen took flight toward the direction of the Celestial Pole. Luo Tian also took flight, heading toward a nearby purple star.

The star was not large but comparable to the initial Tianyuan Continent. The entire continent was purple, with a flowing aura of purple.

“Is there anything good on this continent?” Luo Tian walked across the land, and the sound of breaking air followed as figures appeared on the continent.

Upon seeing Luo Tian, they paused slightly. Luo Tian's fearsome reputation was well known; even if he didn’t carry weapons in the Washing Star Pool, his strength was beyond their ability to confront.

“Go…” Soon, someone left this purple continent. Though it might hold fortune, they definitely weren’t Luo Tian's match. Competing would waste time; there were so many stars, and they could find another easily.

Though some left, a few remained. Among them were Ye Hong and Ye Meier, who had been locked in the dungeon by Ye Liangchen, as well as several powerful Ye family disciples.

“Brother, should we attack now and kill this kid!” Ye Meier's face was twisted with hatred. As she spoke, her white makeup kept falling off.

“Don’t worry, Meier. This Luo Tian only defeated a True Immortal peak with some top-tier divine artifacts and formations. Together, we can kill him!”

“He is a Daoist Disciple, but our positions are not low. And the elders have ordered that even if we kill him, it's fine!” Ye Hong’s companions spoke, their eyes filled with cruelty as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“Maybe we should check the Celestial Pole first. After all, it's important!” One youth spoke, his voice filled with gravity, trying to persuade.

As the youth’s words ended, Ye Hong and other youths showed disdain.

“Ye Ling, don’t be timid. If it weren’t for being our clan brother, would we have brought you? A son of a lowly woman, how dare you speak to us!” Ye Hong spoke coldly.

Chapter 2000: You Strike Women

“Don’t want to go? No one wants to have you around!” Ye Hong roared at Ye Ling, his voice filled with impatience.

Ye Ling said nothing but gazed deeply at Luo Tian walking around. He took flight toward the continent's exterior.

“Coward, truly not worthy of being our companion!” Several youths looked down on Ye Ling as he left without giving him a second thought.

Ye Ling had been bullied since childhood, his low status making him ignored by the clan.

“Idiots!” Ye Ling flew into the starry expanse, muttering to himself. He then took flight toward other continents.

“Long time since I saw the stars. It's nostalgic!” Luo Tian walked across the purple continent, his face filled with admiration. He didn’t care who followed him or how many, for in his eyes, these people were trash.

“Life energy is contained within this continent!” As he walked, Luo Tian didn’t forget that the Washing Star Pool was filled with fortune and treasures. He began to sense how this purple continent differed from others.

“Buzz…” A humming sound echoed, and waves of energy rose beneath the starry expanse. Someone had already opened a treasure and obtained its contents. Stars glowed, making the black starry expanse brighter.

“Rippling…”, As Luo Tian spoke, he felt the sound of water entering his ears. A smile appeared on his face.

He stepped forward and found a pool of purple water before him.

A geyser rose from the pool, continuously spreading out to form a small stream. Above the geyser floated a purple pill, surrounded by violet qi and emitting radiant light. Its rich fragrance spread around.

“Purple Sun Pill!” Luo Tian recalled the types of pills, his eyes flashing with brilliance.

The Purple Sun Pill was a seventh-grade immortal pill. Like a purple sun, it not only enhanced the cultivator's cultivation but allowed them to climb one level. Most precious of all, it was ideal for fierce beasts, enabling them to transform earlier.

A seventh-grade immortal pill. How precious! Luo Tian couldn’t cultivate it now. Few in the entire Immortal realm could. Xuan Dan, a sixth-grade immortal pill artisan, was already rare in the Immortal realm. Even Ye Wudao wanted Xuan Dan to join Star River Estate, showing how precious immortal pill artisans were. Luo Tian was only a fourth-grade immortal pill artisan; seventh-grade immortal pills, Xuan Dan might be able to cultivate.

Gaining this Purple Sun Pill gave Luo Tian an 80% chance of analyzing its formula. With Xuan Dan's expertise, practicing more might allow him to cultivate the Purple Sun Pill.

“Truly everywhere is fortune!” Luo Tian's eyes showed admiration as he gazed at the floating purple pill. He hadn’t expected to encounter such a high-grade pill just by walking around.

“Purple Sun Pill!” As Luo Tian marveled, Ye Hong and others stood behind him. Their faces showed shock.

“Is that all you are?” Luo Tian frowned, surprised these people looked down on him so much. Only Ye Hong and a few followed.

“Get out of the way! We want this Purple Sun Pill!” Ye Hong roared, his voice filled with excitement. He took flight, passing Luo Tian to rush toward the purple geyser.

“Roar…” As Ye Hong took flight, the purple water violently churned into a long purple dragon, striking Ye Hong fiercely.

“Return!” Luo Tian also smiled coldly and extended his hand. A golden hand formed, grabbing Ye Hong.

“Stop him! Once we sell this Purple Sun Pill, we’ll split the profit!” Ye Hong roared. His eyes fixed on the purple dragon before the Purple Sun Pill.

“Buzz…” As Ye Hong’s words ended, Ye Meier and several youths also formed hand seals. They launched martial techniques toward the golden hand Luo Tian casually conjured.

“Who are you to touch what is mine?” Luo Tian looked at the martial techniques, his face cold. He clenched his hands and the golden hand transformed into a fist, charging toward those martial techniques.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” The explosion echoed. Those martial techniques were shattered by Luo Tian’s fist, which advanced like a storm toward Ye Hong.

“Damn it! A bunch of useless people!” Ye Hong mentally cursed. He felt the overwhelming golden fist behind him. If he met it, he wouldn’t have a good outcome.

But Ye Hong had no time to dodge. The purple dragon roared forward, and the golden fist followed closely, giving Ye Hong no chance to retreat.

“Ah…” Ye Hong chose Luo Tian’s fist. He suddenly turned and rushed toward Luo Tian with the golden fist.

Flying, Ye Hong formed hand seals. His body transformed into a star, his skin turning earthy yellow. A surge of immortal energy enveloped Ye Hong.

“Crack…” In an instant, the golden fist collided with Ye Hong transformed into a star. A crackling sound echoed, causing the stars to tremble.

The star shattered, and Ye Hong’s battered body was suddenly thrown back. He spat blood and fell to the ground.

“Don’t move! Move again, and you’ll die!” As Ye Hong tried to stand up, a ghostly figure appeared beside him. A cold voice echoed in his ear, making Ye Hong shiver. A big foot stepped onto Ye Hong’s chest.

“This…!” Ye Meier and others showed disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian with his foot on Ye Hong. In a moment, they hadn’t reacted before finding Luo Tian’s foot on Ye Hong's chest.

“What are you doing? The Washing Star Pool forbids killing. If you kill me, the elders won’t let it go!” Ye Hong’s face showed fear as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“Ye Hong is no match for him!” Outside, Star River Estate disciples showed admiration. They gazed at Luo Tian on the curtain. Though his image was only a small part, some people saw it.

“Ye Hong is among the top in Star River Estate. He was defeated by Luo Tian immediately. It seems this Luo Tian isn’t just a reputation!” Some people whispered.

However, compared to Luo Tian’s situation, the Celestial Pole was more eye-catching. Even the elders controlling the curtain magnified the scene of the Celestial Pole, making it nearly visible to everyone.

At that moment, beside the dazzling star, several figures stood. These were almost the most outstanding talents in Star River Estate.

“Do you want to compete with me?” Ye Liangchen narrowed his eyes, gazing at the three men and one woman. He spoke softly, still light-hearted.

“Master Daoist Disciple, the Celestial Pole is open for all to compete. We also want it!” The man in green robe, Ye Tong, spoke, his eyes showing no掩饰 of disdain.

“Seems you came prepared. Then let’s see who is faster!” Ye Liangchen looked at them without any intention of tearing up, his voice filled with arrogance. He still had that纨绔 manner.

“The Celestial Pole has nine hundred and ninety-nine restrictions. I can enter with my bloodline power. What about you? Rely on brute force?” Ye Liangchen smiled slightly, then pointed his finger. A drop of blood flew from his fingertip toward the golden barrier.

“Buzz…” Waves rose, and the barrier opened a crack. It quickly healed, and Ye Liangchen’s figure disappeared from their sight.

“We are branches, but our bloodline power can also open the barrier. It’s just slower than his!”

“Luo Tian may be killed, but Ye Liangchen isn’t the time to kill. If we kill Ye Liangchen, Ye Wudao will go mad. It’s not the time yet!” Ye Tong and others spoke, then extended their hands. Four drops of blood flew from their hands, gathering together toward the barrier.

The opening reappeared but was slower than Ye Liangchen’s. The four people frowned slightly.

“Let’s try our best. If it doesn’t work, we’ll have to take by force. Once we get the Celestial Pole, then kill that Luo Tian. Our mission will be complete!” They whispered among themselves and took off toward the opening created by the drop of blood.

...

“Boom… Boom…” On another side, on the purple continent, Luo Tian knocked down those remaining with one punch. A smile appeared on his face.

“Lie down and don’t move, or I’ll break your ribs!” Luo Tian imposed a restriction on the group. He spoke to Ye Hong.

“Tell me, what was your purpose? Who among you is with you?” Luo Tian stood with his hands folded, addressing Ye Hong.

“You’ll kill me first before I say!”

“Crack…” Ye Hong shouted, but a breaking sound came from his body.

“You speak!” Luo Tian turned and approached another woman. His eyes were playful, flashing with sharpness.

“I won’t say!” The woman’s body trembled but she still shouted.

“Good, good, good. I don’t like hitting women! You first!” Luo Tian approached the next person.

“I won’t say…”

“Crack…” Luo Tian kept asking, but these people were stubborn. None spoke.

“Do you speak?” Luo Tian sighed longingly and approached the last person, Ye Meier. If it weren’t for necessity, Luo Tian would have avoided talking to this Ye Meier.

“I won’t say!” Ye Meier gritted her teeth, speaking as a layer of white makeup fell off her face. The fragrance made Luo Tian feel nauseous.

“Boom…” Without hesitation, Luo Tian stepped on Ye Meier’s face.

“You hit a woman!” Ye Meier shouted but was stopped by another big foot, preventing her from finishing.

Chapter 2001: The Transformation of the Gourd

“You hit a woman…” Ye Meier shouted, but each time she spoke, Luo Tian’s big foot fell on her face.

“I’ve been tolerating you for a long time!”

“You’d better say what I want. Don’t talk nonsense!” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed, making Ye Meier tremble.

“You….” Ye Meier looked at the shoe sole that had been wiped clean by her face, and she spoke again.

“Boom…” The big foot fell again, still on Ye Meier’s face.

“He isn’t against hitting women. Why does it seem he takes pleasure in stepping on Ye Meier? No sense of guilt at all!” Ye Hong and others had twitching mouths, watching Luo Tian’s big foot repeatedly fall.

“Is that Daoist Disciple Luo Tian gone mad? He's torturing Ye Hong like this!” Outside, the crowd was chaotic. People gazed at Luo Tian repeatedly stepping on others’ faces. They could only see Luo Tian’s actions but couldn’t hear the conversation between him and them.

“This kid has already defeated Ye Hong, taken the fortune. Why does he also humiliate Ye Hong? It's quite excessive!” On another side, the high-ranking members of the Ye family showed anger and spoke loudly.

Ye Wudao and Ye Tian had no change on their faces, sitting quietly and watching the figures in the picture.

“Enough arguing. This small matter I’ll punish this kid myself!” Ye Wudao looked around at the crowd, then coughed and spoke to them.

“Then we’ll watch how the Lord of the Estate punishes him!” Hearing Ye Wudao’s words, people naturally couldn’t say anything more. Their faces were all smiling.

“The game has just begun!” Everyone had their own thoughts, gazing at the large curtain. Ye Wudao and Ye Tian sat there, no one knew what they were thinking.

“I say, I’ll say! My beautiful face!” Ye Meier finally couldn’t bear it. Her face was stepped on by Luo Tian and became a pig’s head, crying pitifully.

Ye Meier wasn’t exactly a beauty but valued her appearance greatly. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have worn such thick makeup. She cared more than ordinary women.

The woman who hadn’t been attacked by Luo Tian before was lying there, trembling and looking at Ye Meier turned into a pig’s head with fear.

“Our goal is to kill you and take the Celestial Pole!” Ye Meier shouted desperately, her voice filled with madness. Her mind had reached the breaking point.

“Who else?” Luo Tian asked, wanting to know who wanted to kill him and also take Ye Liangchen. He wanted to eliminate them all.

“Ye Tong, Ye Xiu, Ye Fu, and Qiu Qian Di…” Ye Meier gave up. She told everything she knew.

“Hmm, I can’t kill you yet. Be good and stay put. Once I get the Purple Sun Pill, I’ll bring you to meet your superiors!” Luo Tian nodded and took out a rope. He tied the four people together, fixed them in place, then gazed at the Purple Sun Pill.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian stepped into the void and rushed toward the purple geyser. Ye Hong showed disdain.

“Self-inflicted suffering. This water isn’t ordinary. The purple dragon was clearly stronger than this Luo Tian, so I chose to fight this Luo Tian instead of the purple dragon!”

“Watch. He’ll be beaten back soon. Even if he’s strong, he won’t match this purple dragon!” Ye Hong spoke to the others, his eyes filled with excitement.

“Roar…” As Ye Hong’s words ended, a roar echoed in people's ears. The purple dragon rose again and seemed to have intelligence. It was more powerful than before.

The purple dragon's eyes glowed with strange light. It opened its mouth and roared toward Luo Tian.

“This Purple Sun Pill, I claim it!” Luo Tian’s face was cold. He still punched toward the purple dragon.

“Boom… Boom…” The golden fist collided with the purple dragon. Purple droplets splashed around.

“My god, one punch shattered it!”

“How is this possible? Even if he's strong, how could he be so strong!” Purple droplets wet the clothes of Ye Hong and others. They looked like they had become soaked chickens, their faces showing shock as they gazed at Luo Tian standing in the sky.

“Still more?” Luo Tian stood in the sky, gazing at the purple pool. His brows slightly furrowed and he punched again, shattering the purple dragon. However, more water dragons kept appearing. Though each was shattered by Luo Tian’s punch, they still blocked his path.

“Haha, we can’t get the Purple Sun Pill either!” Ye Hong lay on the ground and shouted. He was sure Luo Tian wouldn’t kill them, so he would just suffer some physical pain.

“Rude!” Luo Tian sneered and then slapped Ye Hong’s face.

“Come out!” Luo Tian growled. Next moment, a gourd appeared in his hand. He opened the lid and activated it. A strong suction came from the gourd.

“Roar…” As Luo Tian took out the gourd, the purple pool also roared toward it. But it seemed naturally restrained by the gourd and was sucked into it.

“Rippling…”, The purple river kept being sucked in. Within less than an hour, under the astonished gaze of Ye Hong and others, the pool was sucked dry.

Luo Tian took flight and instantly appeared before the Purple Sun Pill. He grabbed it with his hand, stored it away, and furrowed his brows slightly.

“This gourd has changed!” Luo Tian looked at the gourd, now back to normal size. His eyes showed contemplation.

When Jiang Taibai gave Luo Tian this gourd, it was crystalline and jade-like. Now it had a faint purple color.

Moreover, the gourd seemed to have an unusual suction force. Looking at it gave a feeling as if it could suck out one's soul.

“That’s Jiang Taibai’s gourd for wine!” Luo Tian felt the gourd's change. Meanwhile, people in Star River Estate were shocked.

“Does he know Jiang Taibai?” Several elders showed surprise and began to discuss.

“Tian knows Jiang Taibai. He once gave Tian a gourd of wine!” Ye Wudao smiled and spoke softly, watching the shocked expressions of those old men.

“Damn it. Why didn’t we know this!” Hearing Ye Wudao’s words, the old men's faces turned dark.

They didn’t know Luo Tian and Jiang Taibai’s relationship. They thought Luo Tian had no background. Even if he was killed, Ye Wudao wouldn’t do anything to them.

But now it seemed they were wrong. Jiang Taibai’s wine wasn’t something anyone could drink. Especially giving a gourd, they had never heard of it.

At this point, they had to consider whether Jiang Taibai would trouble them if Luo Tian was killed. Jiang Taibai's strength was there, and he was from the Supplementing Heaven Mountain. His status was much higher than theirs.

Thinking of this, the old men felt uneasy but had no choice. The Washing Star Pool was already open, and they had no reason to forcibly reopen it.

“Oh, by the way, I heard that Jiang Yuzhe and Luo Tian are brothers. Tian once saved Yuzhe’s life. Yuzhe's illness was cured by Tian. Our Tian is truly a prodigy!” Ye Wudao watched the old men who were like ants on a hot pan and decided to add more fuel.

“What?” Hearing Ye Wudao’s words, the old men's faces turned pale. They then anxiously watched the curtain.

“Such a timid little man wants to achieve great things?” Ye Wudao and Ye Tian’s eyes showed contempt briefly. They then gazed back at the curtain.

Luo Tian didn’t care about the gourd’s change. He returned to Ye Hong and others, his eyes showing contemplation.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian thought about how to deal with these people, a strong fluctuation echoed beneath the starry expanse.

“Brother Tian, come quickly to guard me!” Ye Xingchen's voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind. This made Luo Tian’s thoughts pause slightly, then a smile appeared on his face.

“Hah! He's fast!” Luo Tian muttered and pulled the rope, leading Ye Hong and others toward the direction of the bright Celestial Pole.

“The Celestial Pole is fully lit. Someone has broken through the restrictions and entered it. If the Celestial Pole is cultivated, then it will have an owner. We’ll be transported out!” People in the Washing Star Pool showed anxiety. Only a few went to the Celestial Pole to watch, while most continued to seize opportunities.

“Damn it. Who took the lead? It seems we have to fight for it!” Three men and one woman showed coldness, gazing at Ye Liangchen sitting in meditation.

A golden sun was behind Ye Liangchen, and waves of energy radiated from his body, surrounding the golden sun.

As Ye Liangchen began to cultivate, the barriers around the Celestial Pole automatically disappeared. This allowed them to see Ye Liangchen's position and quickly rush toward him.

“Go!” They immediately roared, their bodies moving toward Ye Liangchen's direction.

“Want to compete for the Celestial Pole, but didn’t ask if I agree!” As they just moved, a figure rushed toward them. Rather than one figure, it was a string of figures tied under a rope, with several battered figures.

“Useless!” Ye Tong and four others saw the person. Their faces turned dark, speaking coldly.

“Since you’ve come yourself, I’ll kill you first!” Ye Tong sneered and took a step toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 2002: Qiu Qian Di

“Just you? You’re too far off!” Luo Tian showed disdain. He then started swinging the rope in his hand, rapidly spinning Ye Hong and others.

“Go!” Luo Tian laughed and directly threw Ye Hong and others toward Ye Tong and four people.

Ye Tong and Ye Fu had just moved when Ye Hong and others flew toward them. This left the four people unsure how to respond.

Wind blew, Ye Hong and others seemed slow but collided with space. Their power was great. If they didn’t respond, the four people might be injured.

“Only lose these people!” Ye Tong and others showed ferocity. They had no choice but to withstand Ye Hong and others.

“Boom… Boom…” Ye Hong and others collided with the fists and martial techniques of Ye Tong and others. They spat blood, then their bodies fell from space.

“Not dead!” Seeing Ye Hong and others still had life, Ye Tong and Ye Xiu’s faces eased. If they accidentally killed Ye Hong, it would be a problem afterward.

“Now only he remains. You three go stop Ye Liangchen from taking the Celestial Pole. I’ll block and distract him!” Ye Tong spoke to the other three, then took flight toward Luo Tian.

“I want to see if you’re as strong as the rumors say!” Ye Tong roared and struck with two fists like meteors toward Luo Tian.

“You’d better fight together. Otherwise, you’ll regret it!” Luo Tian sneered and pointed his finger. A powerful pressure pressed toward Ye Tong, then he turned around again to appear before Ye Fu and three others. He struck with a palm.

“Boom…” The explosion echoed. Golden fingers pressed against two fists, and Ye Tong was thrown back. Blood flowed from his mouth, and his eyes showed disbelief.

In just a moment, Ye Tong felt as if he had been hit by a mountain. After all, Luo Tian only used one finger.

“Buzz…” Still just one finger. The pressure was terrifying, making Ye Fu and others show concern.

“Dance of the Butterfly!” A cold voice echoed. The woman who hadn’t spoken before shouted, and a green butterfly flew from her hand. It transformed into a green petal, striking toward the golden finger.

“Kill…” Ye Fu and Ye Xiu also shouted. They moved their hands, and a mountain and a golden tower struck toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian roared. He continuously moved his hands, throwing punches toward the mountain and tower.

“Boom… Boom…” The explosion echoed. Space began to tremble. Each punch made Luo Tian spit blood, his face pale.

“What’s happening?” Seeing Luo Tian spitting blood, they showed confusion. Luo Tian had just been strong but now was so weak.

“Indeed a paper tiger!” Ye Tong and others felt contempt. They rushed toward Luo Tian again.

“What’s so weak?” Not only did Ye Tong and others feel confused, but people outside also felt puzzled. It clearly didn’t match the rumors of Luo Tian.

“Lord, I suggest forcibly opening the Washing Star Pool. If the Daoist Disciple is in danger, Lord will be sad!” Several elders spoke to Ye Wudao. Their voices were urgent, especially after seeing Luo Tian spit blood again.

“Don’t rush. Everyone is a genius of Star River Estate. I don’t think there will be too many casualties!” Ye Wudao replied softly, but he was also confused about what was wrong with Luo Tian. He didn’t believe Luo Tian had such strength.

“This is the top among True Immortals? Facing Star River Estate’s geniuses, he was just beaten down. Look at how long he's been spitting blood. I think he’ll die from it soon!” Because of being close to the Celestial Pole, their battle was fully magnified.

“Haha! Luo Tian, with such strength, how dare you be the Daoist Disciple of Star River Estate? Don’t you fear the wind is too strong and makes your ears ring? It seems today you’ll stay here forever!” Ye Tong and others laughed, looking at Luo Tian who was subdued again. They mocked him loudly.

“Cough… Cough…” Luo Tian’s eyes showed weakness, and he was hit by Ye Fu's palm. He fell toward the starry expanse.
