“Buzz……” The black sword turned, slicing past Luo Tian with a whoosh, drawing gasps from the crowd. In an instant, Luo Bai felt the threat of death; a cold wind rushed behind him as two glimmers of frost shot forth from the void, slicing toward Luo Bai again.

“Get out!” Luo Bai roared, a layer of fine scales covering his remaining arm as he lunged toward the descending glimmers. Sparks flew, and the black ghost hand clashed with the scythe, sending Luo Bai stumbling backward. A gust of fists surged forward as Luo Tian’s figure arrived before Luo Bai, three punches merging into one, slamming into the wounded Luo Bai.

“Crack……” The sound of splintering echoed again as Luo Tian’s fist caved in Luo Bai’s back, sending him sprawling to the ground. Silence fell over the Luo family; only the sound of breaking air echoed across the arena, the sound of the Killing Life Ghost piercing space.

“Luo Bai has been defeated!” Almost everyone’s faces bore disbelief as they murmured, their gazes turning to Luo Tian standing there.

“How could he lose? That’s Luo Bai, blessed with ghost meridians and having reached the middle stage of True Immortality!” Someone gasped, but Luo Bai, struggling to rise from the ground, forced them to accept the truth.

“Impossible! My son couldn’t lose!” Duan Peizhen shrieked, her eyes locking onto Luo Bai’s pitiful form.

“You dare!” She hadn’t looked closely before, but now her face paled instantly. Two glimmers of frost appeared behind Luo Bai, the black scythe seemingly intent on ending his life. It was the Killing Life Ghost. Everyone’s faces shifted slightly; Luo Chengyang stood up, his hand outstretched as a wave of True Immortality peak pressure swept forth. A black sword shot from his hand, instantly blocking the Killing Life Ghost’s scythe, drawing a collective sigh of relief.

“Wicked beast!” Luo Chengyang bellowed, his hand reaching out as an invisible force pulled the Killing Life Ghost into a black hand.

“Boom……” Black mist rose, and the monstrous form exploded, the Killing Life Ghost crushed by Luo Chengyang’s grip.

“Clang……” A black ghost pearl fell onto the arena, shimmering with a dark luster.

“Woof……” The black dog darted forward like lightning, devouring the black ghost pearl in one gulp. Luo Tian ignored the dog, his eyes flashing cold as he leapt skyward, transforming into a black hawk that dove down with a thunderous strike toward the trembling Luo Chen.

“Fool, you dare!” Duan Peizhen roared, her body going mad as she launched herself toward the arena.

“Boom……” Luo Tian’s foot crushed Luo Bai beneath him, his eyes cold as he grabbed the Drifting Dragon Sword and slashed at Luo Bai’s back. At the same time, Duan Peizhen reached Luo Tian, five fingers emitting five glimmers of frost that pierced toward him.

“Bitch, get out!” Luo Tian waved his hand, a long sword flying forth to meet the five glimmers.

“Explosive!” Luo Tian sneered, a terrifying wave erupting outward—a wave of self-destruction from an upper-grade immortal artifact. During these days in the Luo family, Luo Tian hadn’t been idle; he had drawn all the spiritual energy from his artifacts and refined them into ghost weapons.

“Stop this at once!” Luo Chengyang’s face shifted slightly as he闪身, appearing before Duan Peizhen. His hands formed a seal, and a dark light enveloped the two of them. A deafening explosion echoed above the Luo family, and a terrifying blast swept through, causing Luo Shui and ten True Immortality late-stage disciples to shift their expressions again. They quickly combined forces to form a barrier, protecting the Luo family’s disciples. Even so, many disciples were thrown into chaos, their blood circulation disrupted, faces pale, some even spitting blood. After the explosion, the arena vanished entirely; Luo Tian stood there, coldly watching Duan Peizhen shielded by Luo Chengyang. His hand held the black Drifting Dragon Sword, its tip dripping with blood.

Luo Bai lay crushed beneath his foot, growling in fury but unable to rise; his back was split open by the Drifting Dragon Sword.

“Don’t take what isn’t yours!” Luo Tian’s hand shot out, a thin black thread flying from Luo Bai’s body, causing Luo Bai to howl.

“Fool, release my son! If you don’t, I’ll kill your whole family!” Duan Peizhen’s face was pale as she shrieked at Luo Tian, her expression turning frantic upon seeing the black thread in his hand.

“Boom……” Luo Tian’s reply was a brutal yank and Luo Bai’s agonized scream. The black thread snapped, and it was one of the eight ghost meridians implanted into Luo Bai’s body from Luo Chen’s.

“Calling me a fool so happily, huh?”

“Killing my family! I, Luo Chen, don’t even have a family anymore!” Luo Tian grabbed another black thread from Luo Bai’s body. His words thundered in the crowd, silencing them as they turned their gazes to Luo Tian. The years of Luo Chen’s suffering in the Luo family were known, and Luo Shui wore a bitter expression.

“Chen’er, you’ve suffered,” Luo Shui whispered inaudibly, his eyes resolute.

“Luo Chen, what are you doing? You’ve already won! Why destroy Luo Bai’s meridians? This is a crime against the clan. If you stop now, I can grant you a full corpse!” Luo Chengyang’s eye twitched as he watched the bloodied Drifting Dragon Sword and Luo Bai, barely breathing. He spoke hurriedly, not because he wanted to kill Luo Tian but because he dared not gamble; the black Drifting Dragon Sword hovered above Luo Bai’s head. Luo Tian wasn’t a Killing Life Ghost; the latter had low intelligence, but Luo Tian was different. He couldn’t be sure if he could strike faster than Luo Tian.

“Luo Chengyang, kill him! Kill him!” Duan Peizhen shrieked, her eyes filled with endless hatred as she glared at Luo Tian.

“Lord of the clan, Luo Chen is your son. This matter must be resolved by you!” Luo Chengyang bellowed, his gaze turning to Luo Shui. At that moment, Luo Tian had already severed the third ghost meridian, and Luo Chengyang shifted the responsibility to Luo Shui.

Chapter 2082: The Luo Family’s Turmoil

“Great Uncle Chengyang, kill him!” Luo Bai howled desperately, his voice filled with madness. The unbearable pain nearly made him faint; if this continued, he truly would prefer death over life.

“Father, kill him!” Luo Bai roared, causing the crowd to shudder.

“What kind of pain must one endure to say such things!” People watched the severed meridians tossed aside, their bodies trembling involuntarily.

“Lord of the clan, this child must not be left alive!” Hearing Luo Chengyang’s words, others echoed, their eyes filled with mockery.

“Crack……” At this moment, Luo Tian had pulled out the third ghost meridian; Luo Bai collapsed unconscious.

“Such a weakling!” Luo Tian chuckled, ignoring Duan Peizhen’s desire to devour him as he pulled out the fourth ghost meridian. Pain surged again, and Luo Bai awoke, his face twisted in agony as he let out a wail.

“Mother… kill me…” Luo Bai whispered, his voice barely audible as he gazed at Duan Peizhen.

“Luo Chengyang, kill this bastard! Kill him!” Duan Peizhen’s heart felt pierced as she heard Luo Bai’s words, blood dripping endlessly.

“Lord of the clan, please act! This matter must be resolved!” Luo Chengyang bellowed, his voice carrying an imperious tone. At this point, only Luo Shui had a hundred percent chance of saving Luo Bai from Luo Tian.

“Enough!” Luo Shui bellowed, a wave of invisible power radiating from him.

“Luo Chengyang, I know what you’re thinking!” Luo Shui roared, his eyes red.

“You ask me to kill my own son? I can’t do it!” Luo Shui coldly replied.

“Lord of the clan, Luo Chen is your son, and so is Luo Bai. How can you watch another son die?” Luo Chengyang pressed.

“You’re so heartless, how dare you be the Lord of the clan!” Luo Chengyang bellowed, his voice equally forceful. His aura surged as if clashing with Luo Shui.

“Ha!” Luo Shui laughed, his voice carrying a touch of coldness.

“Ask Duan Peizhen who Luo Bai is, whose child he is!” Luo Shui bellowed.

“Luo Chengyang, I can tell you: since I married Duan Peizhen, I’ve never shared a bed with her!” Luo Shui spoke again, his voice filled with disdain.

“WHAT!” The crowd’s faces bore disbelief as they turned to Duan Peizhen. Even Luo Tian was startled, his gaze shifting toward Duan Peizhen.

“I….” Duan Peizhen’s face turned pale, as if struck by lightning, frozen in place.

“For years I’ve endured! Even distancing myself from my own son, treating him like a stranger, letting him live worse than a servant!”

“Back then with the ghost meridians, I didn’t confront it. But you still wouldn’t let me be at peace!”

“My son has suffered enough! Now that he’s risen, who dares to harm him? I’ll protect my son even if it means betraying the clan!” Luo Shui bellowed, his hand holding a black sword as an overwhelming aura radiated from him.

“Autumn Water Sword, how long has it been since it drew blood? Today I’ll let you draw blood!” Luo Shui whispered, gently wiping his sword.

“Chen’er, today you may act freely! Whatever happens, I’ll shield you! For years I’ve wronged you. I lacked the strength to protect you, so I deliberately distanced myself!” Luo Shui gazed at Luo Tian, his eyes soft. As Luo Shui’s words echoed, the entire Luo family fell silent; everyone understood the truth immediately. Luo Chen had indeed been the original ghost meridian holder, but it was Duan Peizhen who had removed and grafted it onto Luo Bai.

“Then who is Luo Bai’s real father?” Soon after, people thought of this question, their gazes turning to Duan Peizhen’s pale face.

“Duan Peizhen, as a wife, you’ve failed your duty for years and harmed our family. Take this divorce decree!” Luo Shui bellowed, his hand waving as he tossed a scroll.

“From now on, we are no longer spouses!”

“But… we are enemies!” Luo Shui spoke clearly, stepping before Luo Tian with the Autumn Water Sword, his gaze turning to Luo Chengyang and others.

“Who is Luo Bai’s father? Is it….” Luo Chengyang spoke, his gaze turning to Duan Peizhen, but then he seemed to realize something.

“Luo Chen, stop harming my son!” Luo Chengyang bellowed, his gaze turning to the half-dead Luo Bai beneath Luo Tian.

“Luo Chen, please release my son… Luo Chen…” At the same time, several voices echoed, causing everyone to pause.

“What’s going on…?” Everyone thought this question, confusedly watching the people who stepped out. Including Luo Chengyang, seven or eight figures stood there—important individuals in the Luo family.

“Ha!” Luo Tian couldn’t help but laugh, halting his torment of the last ghost meridian in Luo Bai.

“Boom……” The entire Luo family exploded, people weren’t fools; they naturally guessed the reason. Their faces bore smiles but dared not laugh aloud, for those who had come to claim Luo Bai as their son were all important figures in the Luo family.

“Luo Bai, look! These are your fathers! You called him a fool so happily; it wasn’t in vain!” Luo Tian intentionally let Luo Bai see this scene, a smile on his face as he addressed him.

“Who is truly Luo Bai’s father!” Luo Chengyang’s face darkened, his gaze turning to Duan Peizhen’s pale expression.

“I don’t know…” Duan Peizhen’s eyes held fear, her gaze turning to the mocking stares around her.

“Ah…” Luo Bai awoke at this moment, fully understanding, his eyes filled with despair as he gazed at Duan Peizhen. Luo Shui’s face was also somewhat troubled; although Duan Peizhen had been his wife, he hadn’t expected her to be so shameless.

“Whore, slut!” Everyone’s minds almost formed this word as they gazed at Duan Peizhen.

“You…” Luo Chengyang’s face was also grim; he had an affair with Duan Peizhen, but he hadn’t expected her to have relations with so many people.

“Who is truly Luo Bai’s father!” Luo Chengyang bellowed, though he had many sons, but Luo Bai was the most promising. If he were his son, he would protect him.

“Luo Chen, kill me! I beg you to kill me!” Luo Bai roared, his voice filled with entreaty, his face full of death. At this moment, Luo Bai longed for death not because of pain but because he couldn’t bear the blow. Falling from a prodigy to not even knowing his real father was unbearable, making him feel he had no face to live. He thought of this and glared at Duan Peizhen with hatred; if not for her, he wouldn’t be in this situation. But Luo Bai knew Duan Peizhen was his mother, and she had indeed fulfilled her maternal duties over the years.

“I don’t know!” Duan Peizhen shrieked, her eyes wild with madness.

“It’s all your fault, Luo Shui! I married into your family with such a status, but you still took that slut!”

“And you had a child with her yet refused to even share a bed!”

“Ha! Those who offended me all die. Do you know how that slut died? So-called difficult labor, but cultivators don’t easily die from it. I killed her with my hands! Ha!”

“Not only that, I also want to humiliate you. Your elder brother, a man with desire but no courage, has coveted your clan leader position for years yet dared not act!”

“These people are all cowards, only following the crowd without daring to speak. Even when you were poisoned by the Immortal Burial, they didn’t dare oppose you!” Duan Peizhen bellowed, cursing Luo Chengyang and the others who had stepped forward.

“Slut, you deserve death!” Luo Shui’s eyes turned blood-red as he heard Duan Peizhen’s words, his killing intent spreading. A sword beam shot from his hand toward Duan Peizhen’s direction.

“Luo Shui, you dare!” Luo Chengyang bellowed from beside Luo Shui, his hand reaching out as a sword appeared in his grasp, blocking the sword beam Luo Shui had launched.

“Luo Shui, you dare to kill me? I am who I am; my father is the Heavenly Ghost King. You kill me, and the entire Luo family will perish with me!” Duan Peizhen bellowed, her eyes filled with arrogance.

“The Heavenly Ghost King… your father is the Ten Courts of Hell. Today I will kill you regardless, I’ve had enough!” Luo Shui sneered.

“Meanwhile, Luo Tian also pulled out the last ghost meridian from Luo Bai; the Drifting Dragon Sword fell, piercing Luo Bai’s throat and ending his desperate wish for death.

“Luo Bai is dead!” Seeing Luo Bai’s throat pierced, the Luo family members erupted in murmurs, their gazes filled with shock and deep sorrow.

“Luo Shui, Duan Peizhen must not be killed!”

“Little bastard, you actually dared to kill!” Luo Chengyang blocked Luo Shui’s attack, his teeth gritted as he watched Luo Tian kill Luo Bai.

“Kill him!” Others who had affairs with Duan Peizhen roared, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“What a move…” Everyone was stunned; they naturally understood why those people rushed at Luo Tian, for they all suspected that Luo Bai was their son.

“I’ll see who can kill me!” Luo Shui stood before Luo Tian, his eyes fierce as a dark aura surged, and he slashed forward.

“Lord of the clan, I’ll assist you!” A cold-faced middle-aged man stood beside Luo Shui.

“This clan’s lord must change today!” Luo Chengyang bellowed, his voice cold.

Chapter 2083: The Battle

“Luo Shui, there’s nothing more to say now. I simply don’t accept you as the clan leader. For years, I’ve never rebelled against you; it was your father’s kindness that kept me from doing so.

“But now it’s different. All this is your fault. If you were to remain a puppet clan leader, that would be fine, but you’ve taken up for this son! You even wanted to kill Duan Peizhen, which would bring the clan’s destruction! I can’t accept this!” Luo Chengyang bellowed, his voice filled with anger.

“Playing the role of a whore and still wanting to set up a shrine, Luo Chengyang, you really are a good elder brother! Your father took you in and it was the right choice!”

“Fight already, don’t waste my time killing!” Luo Shui’s face bore a cold smile as he replied, his strength unyielding. The Luo family members heard the conversation between Luo Shui and Luo Chengyang, realizing that the clan was about to change. Luo Chengyang was vying for the lordship. However, they knew that whether it was Luo Shui or Luo Chengyang becoming the clan leader, it had little to do with them. Yet people still favored Luo Shui more; after all, his bloodline was pure and the true lineage of the Luo family, while Luo Chengyang was merely an adopted son.

“Both father and son of the clan have suffered greatly, all due to your elder brother’s betrayal!” People sighed, watching Luo Tian and Luo Shui.

“Lord of the clan, how much of your strength can your poison allow you to use?” Luo Chengyang’s face bore a cold smile as he asked.

“Enough to deal with you!” Luo Shui coldly replied, the middle-aged man beside him having a perpetually icy face and cautious eyes toward Luo Chengyang’s group.

“Kill…” Luo Chengyang’s face bore a cold smile as he leapt forward toward Luo Shui, while the six True Immortality late-stage elites also rushed toward Luo Tian and the middle-aged man. Luo Shui didn’t move, standing still because his son was behind him; he knew that if he moved, his son would be surrounded and killed by the six True Immortality late-stage disciples.

A wave of swords surged as Luo Shui wielded his black sword, and nine waves of sword energy shot from his hand.

“Luo Shui, my brother, is this all you can do?” Luo Chengyang’s face bore a cold smile as he danced his sword toward Luo Shui. Nine collisions echoed in the sky, shaking the Luo family disciples’ pale faces as they retreated to give Luo Shui and his group a large enough battlefield. Luo Shui’s aura surged, his black sword dancing as he stood still against one True Immortality and six late-stage disciples!

“Why hasn’t the half-step Immortal King stopped this?” Luo Shui thought, colliding with Luo Chengyang again. Though he blocked the attack, his body bore several shocking wounds.

“Painful to fight while suppressing your poison, isn’t it?” Luo Chengyang’s face bore a slight smile as his sword energy surged into a terrifying storm, sweeping toward Luo Shui.

“After all these years, I’ve never attacked you. This time it’s your fault!” Luo Chengyang sneered; though his preparation wasn’t sufficient, he was confident that with his current strength, he could kill Luo Shui and take over.

Luo Tian stood there, watching the battle between Luo Shui and others. He ignored the powerful collisions around him, his hand sweeping to retrieve the eight ghost meridians he had taken from Luo Bai.

“Luo Shui’s poison must be the same as mine. I wonder if Dragon Elephant Sealing can help him remove it! If so, his strength might fully erupt!” Luo Tian thought as he watched the battered Luo Shui. A True Immortality peak battle was beyond his control.

“Kid, die!” As Luo Tian pondered, a True Immortality late-stage disciple broke through Luo Shui and the middle-aged man’s defense, rushing toward Luo Tian. This was Luo Ping. At this moment, Luo Ping had gone mad; there was no way back. Overthrowing the clan leader was a taboo, and if they won this battle, it would be fine. If they lost, they’d surely face eternal ruin. The ten True Immortality late-stage disciples of the Luo family had six allied with Luo Chengyang, and they’d been planning for a long time. Originally, they intended to wait until Luo Shui was fully consumed by the Immortal Burial poison before acting, which would be more secure. But now Luo Chengyang had acted early, so they had no choice but to follow suit; they couldn’t let their years of effort go to waste.

“Come…” Luo Shui roared, his body covered in wounds as he reached out into the void. A rift appeared in the sky, and black mist flowed down from it, forming countless ghostly creatures that filled the world. Over a thousand ghosts, each at True Immortality level, with three of them being late-stage True Immortals, howled and rushed toward Luo Chengyang’s group.

“Indeed, the most promising ghost summoner of the Luo family! It seems you’ve been busy despite your poisoning and apparent decline!” Luo Chengyang’s eyes flickered slightly. Delay was dangerous, the longer it lasted, the more chances for unexpected events. On another front, Luo Ping had reached Luo Tian’s side.

“Think you’re so easy to kill?” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cruelty as he waved his hand, a black Dao Bell flying from it. Its power was overwhelming, directly crushing toward Luo Ping.

“Explosive!” Luo Tian bellowed; this was his last upper-grade immortal artifact he could detonate. Originally, Ye Liangchen had exchanged ten upper-grade immortal artifacts, and Luo Tian had kept only four, giving the other six to Ye Liangchen. Additionally, in the Hell King Palace, he had already used three of them. As for the Rupture Spear and Sun-Seeking Bow, he hadn’t dared to detonate them yet.

“How many upper-grade ghost weapons does he have!” Everyone’s hearts trembled, not expecting Luo Tian to still have upper-grade immortal artifacts to detonate!

“Damn it!” Luo Ping’s face changed instantly. He had planned to kill Luo Tian in one strike, but the terrifying wave above forced him to focus on it.

“Boom…” As Luo Ping just raised a barrier, the wave of destruction swept forth, its thunderous sound surpassing even the clash between Luo Shui and Luo Chengyang. Dust swirled, the sky cracked, and Luo Ping was buried in the terrifying storm, causing the Luo family disciples to gasp.

“Terrifying… Luo Chen is truly wasteful! The Luo family only has two upper-grade ghost weapons, and he’s already detonated two in such a short time. What a wastrel!” People’s mouths twitched, their hearts bleeding. As the smoke cleared, Luo Ping’s battered body was revealed. He wasn’t Luo Chengyang; there was a level difference between them. Facing an upper-grade immortal artifact’s self-destruction, even if Luo Ping could withstand it, he couldn’t endure the strain.

“Little brat, I don’t believe you’d dare to detonate an upper-grade ghost weapon again!” Luo Ping bellowed, spitting two mouthfuls of blood as he rushed toward Luo Tian. But before he took a step, he stopped, his gaze turning to the black Drifting Dragon Sword in Luo Tian’s hand.

“Do you think I dare?” Luo Tian smiled, a terrifying aura radiating from his hand.

“You…” Luo Ping’s heart trembled as he gazed at Luo Tian; he dared not gamble. That last strike had left him in a terrible state, and if it happened again, he might be killed.

“Don’t worry, I won’t detonate upper-grade ghost weapons again!” Luo Tian smiled, his spiritual energy pouring into the Drifting Dragon Sword.

“Buzz…” The sword’s aura surged, and a sky-shaking energy radiated from the Drifting Dragon Sword in Luo Tian’s hand. The overwhelming sword intent made the sky change color.

“Damn it… he’s stalling to prepare an attack!” Luo Ping immediately understood Luo Tian’s plan, his face changing. Luo Ping leapt into the air, hands forming seals as a black light shot from his forehead toward Luo Tian. At the same time, Luo Tian’s sword intent was fully formed; the black sword intent surged skyward, cutting through the air. It was a single strike to kill an immortal.

“Buzz…” The void trembled as the two lights collided instantly. Luo Ping’s hastily launched beam was instantly obliterated by the sword intent, causing his face to turn dark.

“Spit…” The next moment, blood splattered as the black sword intent sliced through Luo Ping’s body, nearly cutting him in half. A deep wound appeared on his waist; this strike left Luo Ping, already wounded, completely unable to fight. The Rupture Spear, refined into black, was in Luo Tian’s hand; his face was also pale. The single strike to kill an immortal had nearly drained all of Luo Tian’s True Immortality energy.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian waved his hand, throwing the Rupture Spear forward. Though he had no True Immortality energy left, he still had his physical strength. The black streak pierced Luo Ping’s throat, pinning him to the ground and causing a stir among the Luo family disciples.

“Luo Ping, an elder uncle, was killed by Luo Chen! He was a True Immortality late-stage disciple!” Everyone’s faces bore disbelief as they gazed at Luo Tian. Luo Chen had already shocked the Luo family with killing Luo Bai, but they hadn’t expected this—Luo Chen had killed Luo Ping in one move. This further proved Luo Tian’s terrifying power.

“What was that strike? So strong!” Everyone’s faces bore shock, including Luo Shui and Luo Chengyang. None of them had expected that the first to die would be Luo Ping, who had come to kill Luo Tian.

“Ha! Indeed, my son!” Luo Shui laughed, his voice filled with satisfaction as he bled, his body seemingly in a final burst of vitality. Just as Luo Shui’s words finished, a series of roars erupted from his body; the last bit of True Immortality energy surged into Luo Shui’s body, causing it to tremble.

Chapter 2084: Each Side's Secrets

Black ghosts formed a wall in front of Luo Tian, Luo Shui, and the middle-aged man who had previously led Luo Tian to Luo Shui’s courtyard. However, these ghosts were constantly being killed by Luo Chengyang’s group; even the three late-stage True Immortals struggled to hold out, their defeat imminent. No one in the Luo family had expected that a simple clan competition would escalate into a struggle for the lordship, revealing so many hidden truths! Luo Shui’s face bore joy as his son’s True Immortality energy entered his body, giving his pale face a touch of color.

“Dragon Elephant Sealing!” Luo Tian’s technique was Dragon Elephant Sealing, as the poison in Luo Shui’s body was the same as his. He had only tried it, hoping Dragon Elephant Sealing could suppress the poison in Luo Shui’s body. The result was evident from Luo Shui’s joy; his plan had worked, and at the same time, Luo Shui’s aura changed completely. His energy was no longer ethereal but gradually solidified.

“Luo Shui, even if you expel the poison, what good is it? Do you think we’ve prepared for years?” Luo Chengyang bellowed, his hand slicing through a late-stage True Immortal ghost. Others also unleashed their power; black light surged, explosions rose constantly, and the ghosts turned into dark mist, falling to the ground as various-sized ghost pearls. The black dog joyfully darted through the dark mist, devouring the ghost pearls on the ground. It was engrossed in its feast, leaving people curious about how such a small body could swallow so many ghost pearls.

“It’s our turn!” Luo Chengyang’s face bore a slight smile, ignoring the black dog devouring ghost pearls. His gaze turned to Luo Shui.

“Buzz…” Luo Chengyang waved his hand, a black sword flying from it. The other five also launched their attacks; each wielded a black sword, rising into the sky and surrounding Luo Tian and the others. “Boom… boom…” Six black swords fell from the sky, striking the ground in six directions. Black mist churned upward, gathering into the sky.

“Luo Tai, submit now, and I’ll let you live!” Luo Chengyang bellowed at the middle-aged man standing beside Luo Shui.

“Get out…” The reply was Luo Tai’s cold words, causing Luo Chengyang’s eyes to flash with more killing intent.

“Since that’s the case, then you’ll die alongside Luo Shui!” Luo Chengyang coldly replied, his hands forming seals. He etched black marks onto the six swords. Others did the same; the black marks entered the swords, and a terrifying wave surged above them.

“Buzz…” The humming echoed as black sword intent gathered over Luo Tian and others, a powerful pressure making Luo Tian pale. The world trembled; the black sword intent seemed like an order from heaven, leaving no will to resist.

“How is it, Luo Shui? This is what I prepared for you—comparable to a仙王 (Immortal King) strike! Can you withstand it?” Luo Chengyang’s face bore a triumphant smile as he pressed his hand into the void.

“Immortal King strike!” Luo Shui’s face darkened, but he gritted his teeth. At this moment, the poison in his body had been completely consumed by four dragons and four elephants, allowing Luo Shui’s strength to reach its peak. He was only a step away from half-step Immortal King. However, even with that, facing an actual Immortal King strike was no match; the two were like heaven and earth.

“Chen’er, don’t worry. Father won’t let you be harmed!” Luo Shui’s face bore determination as his aura slowly rose.

“Buzz…” A faint mark appeared on Luo Shui’s body, eventually forming a fierce ghost face that manifested on his skin.
