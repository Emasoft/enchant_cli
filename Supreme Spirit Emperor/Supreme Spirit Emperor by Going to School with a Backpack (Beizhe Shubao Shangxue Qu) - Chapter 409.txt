"Please, Master Luo Tian, I was wrong—won’t you let us move on to the fourth level? Let’s leave this cursed place!" Diaodezhu immediately softened, pleading to Luo Tian.

"Ha... I agree!" Zheng Xin and the others instantly displayed joy, rushing toward Diaodezhu. They would not miss this chance to take advantage of his vulnerability.

"Enough, stop fooling around. Let’s rest and prepare for the next level," Luo Tian said softly. He recalled Mei Xueyin's words about a powerful presence in the fourth level, possibly another fierce battle. Their condition must be at its peak to face the final trial.

Though their strength had greatly increased, and this level held no combat, there was no need to rest. After a brief respite, Luo Tian reabsorbed the information Mei Xueyin had given him.

"Six Paths of Reincarnation Sword Technique!" Luo Tian recalled the only useful thing Mei Xueyin had left for him, his face lighting up with excitement.

The Six Paths of Reincarnation Sword Technique consisted of six forms, but Mei Xueyin's residual consciousness only held one. This technique was created by Mei Xueyin’s father, the founder of the Tian Dao Sect—Duo Tian Xian Wang.

Though Luo Tian knew how to use it, he dared not attempt it. Though this was only the first form, he knew it wasn’t activated by Epoch Power. If forced to use Epoch Power, the result would be apocalyptic—after all, this was a technique from the celestial realm, connected to immortals. How could it be simple?

The cost was also terrifying. Luo Tian felt only by becoming an Epoch Lord could he unleash the full power of this technique; otherwise, even if he used it, his body might be drained.

"From now on, I fear no one in the Nine Realms!" Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with confidence. If he fought desperately, he could sweep aside any opponent with this technique.

"Let’s go. I hope the next level is smoother," Luo Tian said to the group, then the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword fell into his hand. He plunged it fiercely into the altar.

"Crack..." The blue sword pierced deep into the altar, and the golden altar began to crack under the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword’s power, spreading outward.

"Boom..." The massive altar suddenly shattered, releasing boundless divine laws that surged outward. A violent wind roared in their ears, and an invisible wave struck Luo Tian’s group, causing their bodies to sink as if falling into a bottomless abyss.

Time passed slowly. After who knew how long, Luo Tian finally felt his feet touch the ground.

"Crack..." A familiar sound rose beneath Luo Tian’s feet, and Sun Mengru, Diaodezhu, and others appeared before him.

"Another pile of bones—can’t you come up with something fresh?" Zheng Xin immediately grew impatient upon landing.

But soon, Zheng Xin instinctively shivered as a cold aura spread over their bodies. The entire hall turned dark, with visibility limited to less than a hundred paces.

"Haha... I’ve been waiting for you. Finally, I found you!" A cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, making him shiver. His eyes turned cautious.

"Who are you?" Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with violet light, scanning around but detecting no movement.

"What's wrong?" Runhongyu and Sun Mengru looked at Luo Tian, their voices filled with confusion. They hadn’t heard the voice Luo Tian had.

"Nothing," Luo Tian shook his head lightly. The voice had only sounded once before fading away.

"Haha... don’t be afraid. I’m just like that woman from the third level—I’ll also give you a boon!" But as Luo Tian barely relaxed, the teasing voice echoed again in his mind.

At the same time, the strange mark on Luo Tian’s neck flickered, standing out conspicuously in the endless darkness. Sun Mengru and others turned their gazes toward Luo Tian.

"Luo Tian... you..." Their faces showed terror, eyes wide with disbelief.

Luo Tian’s gaze then fell on the others, and his own eyes turned frantic. Their forms had changed—Sun Mengru was now a pink skeleton with golden flames in its eyes, and the others had also become skeletons.

"What’s happening!" Luo Tian was stunned by this sudden transformation, his heart filled with horror.

Chapter 1611: Awakening

"Ahh..." Luo Tian stared at the skeletons before him, his face filled with fear. He didn’t know why they had suddenly turned like this.

"Kill them—they are your enemies!" The seductive voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, shaking even his formidable spiritual soul. A wave of killing intent surged through him, clouding his mind.

"Kill... kill them, and you’ll transcend, saving your friends..." The second voice echoed. At this point, Luo Tian had completely lost his mind.

Even Luo Tian was mindless now; how much more so the others? At this moment, they all saw Luo Tian as a skeleton—the one who had devoured him.

"Roar..." In their madness, everyone focused solely on avenging Luo Tian and rushed toward him.

Luo Tian was the same, his mind filled with killing intent as he charged at Sun Mengru’s skeleton.

"Crack..." In an instant, Luo Tian collided with Sun Mengru’s skeleton, the collision sending him back two steps.

Sun Mengru's pink bones flew backward, their surfaces cracking.

"Ahh..." But in the collision, Luo Tian’s heart suddenly ached, shaking his mind filled with killing intent. His movements slowed slightly.

Though Luo Tian had somewhat recovered, the others hadn’t. All of them seemed to have gone mad, rushing toward Luo Tian.

"Something’s wrong! Why does my heart hurt so much? Who am I? Where am I?" Luo Tian’s mind gradually cleared, thinking desperately.

"Boom..." At the same time, others’ attacks struck Luo Tian’s body. The sound of collision echoed, and Luo Tian was constantly attacked by the group.

"I’ve changed!" Luo Tian let them attack, raising his hands and looking at them. He saw himself transformed into a golden skeleton, covered with cracks from the group’s attacks.

"How could this be!" As they kept attacking, Luo Tian's heart ached more deeply, his eyes filled with confusion.

"Ahh..." Luo Tian roared to the sky, but soon others’ attacks struck again. Instinctively, he rushed toward them, colliding repeatedly with the group.

Cracking sounds echoed endlessly in the endless darkness as Luo Tian and his companions clashed. If it were normal, they would never have attacked each other.

But now, they didn’t know what spell had ensnared them. They felt like skeletons, constantly attacking Luo Tian. At this moment, the group seemed like marionettes controlled by invisible strings.

If someone were清醒 (clear-minded), they would notice that as the group clashed, blood spilled from their bodies.

But with each attack, Luo Tian’s pain intensified, and his mind gradually cleared.

"I am Luo Tian!" After repelling Chen Zhanbiao, Luo Tian roared to the sky, his mind fully restored. He remembered where he was.

As Luo Tian’s eyes regained clarity, the scenery around him changed. Others no longer appeared as colorful skeletons but as real people. However, they kept rushing toward him, bloodied and wounded from the previous battle.

Luo Tian himself was also covered with cracks. His eyes turned cold as he shouted into the void: "Who are you!"

"Haha... faster than I expected. Who I am doesn’t matter. What matters is what you’ll do now—these are your family and friends; they all want to kill you. Will you fight back?" The seductive voice echoed, leaving Luo Tian unsure of its origin. Though he had recovered, the darkness still surrounded him.

"Damn it!" As Luo Tian pondered, Chen Zhanbiao’s massive body rushed toward him. He threw a simple punch at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian dared not be careless but feared injuring Chen Zhanbiao. He threw a punch, carefully controlling the power to collide with Chen Zhanbiao’s massive fist.

"Stomp... stomp... stomp..." Chen Zhanbiao was pushed back by Luo Tian’s punch but rushed forward again.

Before Luo Tian could catch his breath, Sun Mengru and Runhongyu’s attacks struck instantly. Luo Tian dodged and repelled them both.

But on the other side, Diaodezhu and Zheng Xin’s attacks also reached Luo Tian. Their fists struck his body.

"Pu..." Though Luo Tian was immensely powerful, being hit by the group’s combined attack made him unable to withstand it. His body was sent flying, colliding with something and producing a loud crash behind him.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed under his breath, spitting blood before Chen Zhanbiao’s massive body rushed toward him.

"Zhanbiao!" Luo Tian called out to Chen Zhanbiao through mental communication, his spiritual震慑 (intimidation) entering Chen Zhanbiao’s body.

"Roar..." But Chen Zhanbiao showed no signs of stopping, ignoring Luo Tian’s words. He seemed like a rutting bull, rushing toward Luo Tian.

"How to fight!" Luo Tian felt bitter despair, forced to clash with Chen Zhanbiao again.

"Boom... boom... boom..." The sound of collision echoed endlessly as Luo Tian clashed with the group, hesitating to injure them.

But Luo Tian was also grateful that they were only using basic physical attacks. Though he was wounded, he could still endure. If he used his martial arts, he might have already been reduced to dust. Even with his extraordinary body, it couldn’t withstand such attacks.

"Can't do this forever; I'll be killed!" As Luo Tian clashed with the group, he thought desperately about a way to escape this crisis.

"Haha... kid, now you must kill them all; otherwise, they’ll keep attacking until their blood is exhausted!"

"Give them a swift death. If you don’t kill them, they’ll die anyway!" The seductive voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind. His neck mark flickered alternately.

"It's impossible!" Luo Tian muttered in his heart, determination in his eyes. Before he was mindless, fighting them without holding back was understandable. But now that he was clear-minded, how could he kill his friends?

"What to do!" Though Luo Tian was resolute, his anxiety grew. His condition worsened; if it continued, he would eventually be unable to withstand it.

"Kid, I'm helping you. To become an ultimate being, you must be ruthless. Do you want to become immortal? Do you want to be the top of this world? To achieve enlightenment through killing, to walk the path of coldness. Once you kill them, you’ll become an ultimate power. Even if you don’t kill them now, they will eventually die. It’s better to fulfill your path!" The seductive voice echoed endlessly in Luo Tian’s mind.

"Go to hell!" Luo Tian cursed, but his body was sent flying again by Chen Zhanbiao and Runhongyu. Blood spewed from his mouth.

"Buzz..." Silver light appeared in Luo Tian’s hand. At this moment, the only way he could think of was to stop them first. The only method was using Runhongyu’s acupuncture technique.

Almost instantly after Luo Tian took out the silver needle, Diaodezhu, Yan Jun, and Xu Liyi’s bodies slightly paused. Their bodies instinctively trembled.

"What's going on?" Though the three only paused slightly, Luo Tian noticed their subtle changes.

"Diaodezhu! Wake up!" Sensing the change in the three, Luo Tian immediately sent his spiritual awareness toward them, trying to wake them.

At the same time, three flashes of cold light flew from Luo Tian’s hand and pierced into their bodies.

"Damn, missed again!" Luo Tian's mouth twitched as he was constantly attacked by Sun Mengru and others.

Though the silver needles were off-target, they still made the three stop in place, their bodies trembling violently as if caught in an unknown fear.

"Effective!" Seeing the three trembling, Luo Tian didn’t care about anything else and endured others’ attacks. He took out the soul-summoning stone, enhancing his spiritual awareness to enter Diaodezhu, Xu Liyi, and Yan Jun’s minds.

"Idiot, wake up! If you don’t wake up soon, I’ll practice my needles on you!" Luo Tian’s voice, like a divine sound, entered the three's minds through the soul-summoning stone. Finally, their bodies stopped moving, and their eyes gradually regained clarity.

"What happened?" The three looked confused before seeing Luo Tian, who was constantly spitting blood due to their attacks.

"Quickly come help me!" Seeing the three awake, Luo Tian shouted at them. At the same time, he was hit again by others, his invincible body showing fine cracks.

"Damn it!" Seeing Luo Tian’s condition, Diaodezhu and the others instantly reacted. Their bodies moved toward Luo Tian's direction. This time, they didn’t attack Luo Tian but each blocked one of the three.

"Ah..." With Diaodezhu’s group joining, Luo Tian's pressure lessened somewhat. He now only had to face Chen Zhanbiao, Sun Mengru, and Runhongyu.

" How did you wake up?" As the pressure lessened, Luo Tian asked Diaodezhu and the others, thinking about how to awaken everyone.

"I don’t know either; I just suddenly shivered!" Diaodezhu, Xu Liyi, and the others shouted. At this moment, they were also facing Luo Tian’s previous dilemma. Their strength wasn’t as strong as Luo Tian's, and they were being constantly suppressed by the three.

"Needle!" Then Luo Tian remembered how the three had awakened before. As Chen Zhanbiao and Sun Mengru attacked him, he took out three silver needles again.

Cold light flashed; at this moment, Luo Tian didn’t care about accuracy anymore. Since aiming was difficult, he just shot the needles at them.

The silver needles cut through the dark space, flashing a silver light and piercing into Chen Zhanbiao, Sun Mengru’s bodies. At the same time, Luo Tian's voice, with his massive spiritual awareness, entered their minds.

But the three seemed unaffected and still rushed toward Luo Tian. Three fists collided with Luo Tian’s body, making him spit blood again.

"Damn it, no use!" Luo Tian's face turned pale as he was hit by the three. He received serious injuries but endured with his strong body.

"Why is this happening?" Luo Tian, dodging the three's attacks, thought again.

"It was exactly like that!" Luo Tian felt confused why they had the same experience, but Diaodezhu and the others could awaken while Sun Mengru's group didn’t change at all.

"Use their personality weaknesses!" When Luo Tian was troubled, Diaodezhu's voice echoed in the dark space, shaking Luo Tian’s mind.

"It really is!" Then a look of joy appeared on Luo Tian's face. He remembered that Diaodezhu and the others had been affected by his acupuncture technique, causing a spiritual tremor that awakened them.

"Let’s try!" Luo Tian wasn’t sure if Diaodezhu's method would work, but since he had an idea, he still needed to try.

"First, try with Zhanbiao!" As he spoke, Luo Tian endured the three's attacks again and waved his hand. A golden wing flew out from his hand, which he had brought from the Demon Realm. He was worried about Zhanbiao getting hungry and used it to satisfy him.

"Shi..." Seven-colored flames flew out from Luo Tian’s hand, instantly engulfing the golden wing with terrifying heat. The scent of roasted meat spread from the wing.

"Gurgle..." As the meaty aroma spread, Zhanbiao's body suddenly stopped. A thunderous sound came from his stomach. He sniffed, and his eyes gained a glimmer of vitality.

"Effective!" Seeing Zhanbiao's movements slowing down, Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with great joy. He placed the soul-summoning stone in his hand and sent his voice into Zhanbiao’s mind.

"Ahh..." Zhanbiao roared, and as Luo Tian's words fell, his eyes regained clarity. His gaze was filled with greed, rushing toward the scorching wing.

"One down!" Luo Tian sighed deeply and then looked at Sun Kemin, who was still fighting with Diaodezhu. For Sun Kemin, it was even simpler.

"Boom..." Thunderous sounds echoed as blue lightning surrounded the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, which Luo Tian had summoned. He planted it into the ground.

"My..." A low voice immediately echoed, Sun Kemin’s face filled with greed as he rushed toward the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword.

"Crack..." But Luo Tian pointed his finger, and blue and golden lightning erupted from the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword. They struck Sun Kemin’s body, and Luo Tian's voice accompanied the thunder in Sun Kemin’s mind. This restored him to normal.

"Damn it, Luo Tian, are you trying to electrocute me?" Although Sun Kemin had returned to normal, the two-colored lightning still crackled on his body, electrocuting him and making smoke rise from his body.

"One more..." Luo Tian ignored Sun Kemin’s complaints and looked at Zheng Xin, sending a scene of Zheng Xin being chased into his mind.

Wan Lingkong and Yan Jun constantly attacked, and the group gradually regained clarity. Time passed nearly a quarter of an hour before everyone except Runhongyu returned to their senses.

"Truly tough. If Luo Tian hadn’t regained his senses, we might have already killed each other!" The group felt a sense of fear. If that had happened, they would have been extremely embarrassed.

"What about Runhongyu? We just met him; we don’t know what he’s afraid of!" Then the group saw Runhongyu still attacking Luo Tian and looked at him with a hint of helplessness.

"I don’t know either..." Luo Tian also furrowed his brows, unsure of Runhongyu’s weakness.

"Maybe we should just subdue him together!" Then Diaodezhu and the others looked excited, wanting to avenge themselves for being pinned by Runhongyu earlier.

"That’s all we can do!" Luo Tian nodded lightly. At this moment, he had no other good ideas. This fourth level was full of danger, and he didn’t want to waste too much time.

"Go..." Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the next moment, Diaodezhu and the others rushed toward Runhongyu. Luo Tian stepped back, throwing a golden fist that collided with Runhongyu. Then he retreated while Runhongyu was sent flying into Diaodezhu’s group.

"Unexpectedly, he has this day!" The group looked happy and used their hands and feet to block Runhongyu, who was rushing toward Luo Tian again.

"Diaodezhu, grab his arm... Zhanbiao, lock his two feet... Damn it, Sun Kemin, you still haven’t forgotten to take others’ things!" The group continuously cursed.

Runhongyu was indeed under the influence of a mental attack, relying only on instinct. However, Diaodezhu and the others were clear-minded. Though it was a bit tricky, they eventually managed to restrain Runhongyu with their combined efforts.

"Roar..." Runhongyu seemed like a tiger in a cage, constantly roaring, making Diaodezhu and the others exert great effort.

"Crackling..." Golden and white lightning erupted from the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, forming two lightning snakes that wrapped around Runhongyu’s body. A wave of sealing power spread from the two lightning snakes, sealing Runhongyu.

"My mom, I’m so exhausted; it feels like my body is about to fall apart!" Seeing Runhongyu sealed, Diaodezhu and the others fell to the ground, panting heavily with relief.

Luo Tian also collapsed on the ground, his body emitting a sense of fatigue. His wounds were self-healing; it had been too dangerous. If they had continued to fight each other, only one person might have survived.

"Who is it?" Luo Tian’s eyes were filled with confusion as he looked into the endless darkness.

"Are we stuck here forever?" Diaodezhu and the others caught their breath, then gathered around Luo Tian. They looked at him, unsure of what to do next.

"Let’s continue moving; maybe we’ll find a way out! But first, let’s rest and adjust our condition to the peak!" Luo Tian said to the group. At this moment, everyone was exhausted and mentally drained; if they continued walking, they might not be able to resist any further dangers.

"Buzz..." Just as Luo Tian’s words fell, a buzzing sound echoed in his ears, making him frown slightly.

Luo Tian didn’t delay and activated the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword to hover above their heads, sending lightning down to protect them.

"What’s wrong?" Seeing Luo Tian’s actions, Sun Mengru and others looked puzzled, unsure why he suddenly did this.

"Didn’t you hear a sound?" Luo Tian’s face showed confusion. He had felt a terrifying fluctuation approaching them for a moment, so he had summoned the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword.

However, the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword was an Epoch Treasure and this fourth level was filled with evil energy. When it was summoned, the fluctuation seemed to fear and disappeared.

"No, I didn’t hear anything. I just saw you being devoured by a skeleton and turned into one, so I wanted to avenge you!" Xu Liyi spoke softly.

"Strange..." Luo Tian lightly touched the mark on his neck, which had been flickering since entering this fourth level. His body showed no abnormalities.

"Since I entered, there’s been a voice in my mind!" Luo Tian said to the group and then recounted the voice he had heard earlier.

"It must be because of the mark on your neck!" Diaodezhu looked at Luo Tian’s mark with confusion.

"Rubbish, everyone knows this mark isn’t good!" Zheng Xin and the others rolled their eyes. Diaodezhu’s words were as useless as nonsense.

"I mean, this mark isn’t simple; I think I’ve seen it before!" Diaodezhu’s eyes showed recollection as he struggled to remember.

Seeing the seriousness on Diaodezhu's face, Luo Tian and others thought he was showing off again. This had become a habit for him, so they didn’t pay attention and started sitting under the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword to recover.

"I know!" But as they just sat down, Diaodezhu’s voice rang out, startling Luo Tian and the others who had just sat down.

Chapter 1613: Immortal Spirit

"What do you know? You’re so noisy!" Hearing Diaodezhu’s voice, Zheng Xin and the others became annoyed. They looked at Diaodezhu and scolded him.

"This... this is the Reincarnation Immortal Mark!" Diaodezhu’s face showed disbelief as he looked at Luo Tian’s mark, exclaiming.

"Reincarnation Immortal Mark!" Hearing Diaodezhu’s words, Luo Tian and the others looked confused. They stared at Diaodezhu, waiting for his explanation.

"I once read about this mark in the ancient texts of the Dragon Clan. A long time ago, a powerful immortal appeared in the Dragon Clan. He was originally ordinary but later had this mark on his body. His cultivation soared, becoming a major power. However, after the mark appeared, this Dragon Clan major power changed drastically."

"Fortunately, the Divine Emperor Tian was born in that era. He eventually killed this Dragon Clan major power for unknown reasons." Diaodezhu spoke softly, recalling the ancient texts.

"Why did he kill him? This major power was a pillar for the Demon Realm at that time!" Zheng Xin looked puzzled and asked, as this was what everyone was confused about.

"Reincarnation Immortal Mark—Spirit Possession!" Diaodezhu spoke softly, his voice heavy with concern. He looked at Luo Tian, worry in his eyes.

"Immortal Spirit? Possession?" Hearing Diaodezhu’s words, Luo Tian and the others’ faces changed slightly. Possession was definitely not a good thing.

"Yes, after Divine Emperor Tian killed that Dragon Clan major power, he only said one sentence and didn’t explain to the Dragon Clan."

"However, at that time, Divine Emperor Tian was at his peak. His prestige in the Demon Realm and even across the Nine Realms was unparalleled. No one would doubt his decision to kill a Dragon Clan major power."

"But I heard the monkey said that after he killed that Dragon Clan major power, he found an opponent and sealed the monkey himself." Diaodezhu sighed softly.

"The people of the Demon Realm guessed that this Dragon Clan major power was possessed by something extraordinary, hence his sudden rise in cultivation. It’s likely that it was an immortal spirit that had lost its body." Diaodezhu spoke softly, his eyes filled with deep concern.

"How could that be? How can there be immortals in the Nine Realms? And how powerful are they? Even an Epoch Lord wouldn’t easily kill one!" Xu Liyi looked puzzled.

"Yes, that’s why the people of the Demon Realm guessed that what Divine Emperor Tian referred to as an immortal spirit wasn’t a real immortal. It was likely something related to immortals, giving birth to an immortal spirit with a trace of immortal energy." Diaodezhu sighed deeply.

After hearing Diaodezhu’s explanation, the group looked at Luo Tian with concern and confusion. They doubted whether Luo Tian was possessed now, as that Dragon Clan major power had been discovered by Divine Emperor Tian.

If Luo Tian was indeed possessed by this so-called immortal spirit, they wouldn’t notice it.

"I’m not possessed!" Luo Tian shook his head lightly and smiled bitterly. Why had he gotten this mark? Just by taking a cup of water, he was mysteriously marked and possibly possessed.

"Then it seems the entire Bone Palace has been tampered with by them; they must want to possess Luo Tian!" Sun Mengru’s eyes showed coldness, and her body radiated killing intent.

"Why didn’t they just attack directly? They have a connection with immortals, so they should be powerful. If they possessed Luo Tian directly, it would have been better. Why make us fight each other?" Zheng Xin looked puzzled and asked softly.

"It must be something on us that they fear. But now it seems they are afraid of the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, as it is an Epoch Treasure and was once a divine weapon!" Luo Tian whispered softly. However, his worry deepened.

The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword was once a divine weapon and a middle-grade one, but now it was an Epoch Treasure. Though powerful, it clearly couldn’t intimidate the immortal spirit for long.

"Maybe Luo Tian’s blood and spiritual power are too strong, making possession difficult. If Luo Tian resisted fiercely, the success rate might not be high," Diaodezhu spoke softly. His worry deepened as few people could remain calm after being infected with such a thing.

"The voice hasn’t spoken for a long time. Is it afraid of the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword?" Luo Tian muttered softly. No matter what, they had to keep moving forward; it was impossible to stay here forever.

"Rest," Luo Tian said to the group, "watch over me carefully. If something’s wrong, seal me! If necessary, kill me!"

After saying this, Luo Tian sat cross-legged on the ground.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, everyone fell silent but also sat cross-legged on the ground. An unknown enemy was the most terrifying, and they knew this one wasn’t easy. They were worried that if Luo Tian was indeed possessed, they wouldn’t notice it, which would be a big problem.

Time passed slowly. After one day of rest in the endless darkness, they all recovered fully and reached their peak condition.

"Let’s go. I want to see what power he has to possess me. I, Luo Tian, am not that easy to bully! There have been many people who wanted to possess me; he’s just another one!" Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with violet light. The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword hovered above his head, lightning enveloping them and illuminating the path forward into the endless darkness.

"Crack... crack..." After walking for nearly an hour, a sharp sound echoed in their ears. Gradually, some light appeared in their vision.

"What is it?" Luo Tian and the others stopped, cautiously looking at the light with serious expressions.

"Crack... crack..." A crisp sound echoed in their ears, and the light rushed toward them quickly. They could now see the source of the light.

Six cold glows swept over, and a massive figure emerged from the endless darkness. Luo Tian and his group couldn’t help but gasp in shock.

Three massive heads appeared in their vision, but they resembled dog heads. Their bodies were immeasurable in length but stood dozens of feet high. In front of this giant, Luo Tian and the others seemed tiny.

A fierce aura radiated from the three-headed beast, making their expressions serious.

Cold fangs and six golden eyes flashed with cold light. Each head held a golden bone skull in its mouth. Just by looking at it, they felt it was no easy opponent.

"Crack..." The three golden bones were bitten and broken by the sharp teeth, falling into the blood-filled mouths. A crackling sound echoed in the dark space.

"This... this is what? He just ate a golden bone skull of an Epoch Lord!" Their faces changed as they had never seen such a creature before.

"Dog... dog! This should be your kind; you can talk to him. Tell him to let us through!" Zheng Xin trembled as he looked at the three-headed dog, directing his gaze toward Diaodezhu.

"Go to hell..." Diaodezhu cursed, but at this moment, looking at the giant, he felt too exhausted to even curse.

"What is this thing? Is it a fierce beast? Why hasn’t it taken form?" Diaodezhu looked puzzled. According to the giant’s aura, if it were a fierce beast, it could have taken form already.

"Roar..." But the three-headed dog rushed toward Luo Tian and his group, its massive body moving with incredible speed. It seemed like a dark cloud, rushing toward them.

At the moment the three-headed dog jumped, a powerful pressure struck their minds, making Luo Tian and his group’s faces turn serious.

"Back!" Luo Tian shouted to the others, not wanting them to be harmed further. He felt a threat from this three-headed dog.
