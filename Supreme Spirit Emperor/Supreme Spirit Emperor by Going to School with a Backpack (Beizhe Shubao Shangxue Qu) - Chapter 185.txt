As he spoke, the black demonic energy completely surged into Luo Tian's body. The grotesque wounds all over his body rapidly healed, and a terrifying fluctuation emanated from within his body. Even Meng Guangxiu was filled with alarm.

"His strength surpasses mine!" Meng Guangxiu gazed at Luo Tian standing beneath the void, his long hair fluttering in the wind. His eyes revealed intense envy.

A hum resonated around them, and a black demonic sword gradually formed in Luo Tian's hands. His gaze swept over Meng Guangxiu and then into the depths of the starry void, "It seems timing is just right."

"Huh?" Upon hearing Luo Tian's self-muttering, Meng Guangxiu's expression shifted. He realized that Luo Tian had delayed the battle to await reinforcements.

However, Meng Guangxiu quickly displayed contempt. His back was lined with elite warriors from the Nether Domain, selected among thousands of candidates. How could they compare to these disorganized forces from the Four Sacred Star Domains?

Following Luo Tian's gaze, Meng Guangxiu extended his spiritual awareness outward. His face then displayed a moment of terror, and his eyes became tense.

"Challenging me while distracted?" As Meng Guangxiu momentarily lost focus, Luo Tian's cold voice echoed in his ears. His body trembled.

Beneath the starry expanse, a black blade's radiance cleaved through the void. It carried endless coldness and instantly appeared above Meng Guangxiu's head.

Meng Guangxiu could not evade in time. The black demonic sword struck his shoulder, mirroring the exact same scene as before when Luo Tian had attacked. Even the words Luo Tian spoke were identical in tone to Meng Guangxiu's, but now their roles had reversed.

Chapter 851: I Also Have One

Amidst the endless starry expanse, hundreds of ancient warships drifted through the radiant river of stars. Black runes surged from each ship, flying out behind them.

What terrified people was that each warship released a black dragon. The end of the dragons connected to a dark planet.

Through the power of these runes, the warships slowly pulled an entire continent toward the Tianyuan Continent.

Several cold-faced figures stood upon the ancient warships. The leader was a woman with an enlarged abdomen, her beauty reaching极致.

Jiang Sxi, one of the newly risen masters of the Four Sacred Star Domains. She had reached the nine-source Celestial Sovereign realm and was a renowned figure across the Four Sacred Star Domains.

Jiang Sxi stood on the deck of the warship, her gaze cold but her heart pounding. If someone were to observe closely, they would find a hidden deep anxiety in her eyes. Beneath that fear was a hint of feminine shyness.

"What if Luo Tian's parents discover I'm carrying his child? Would they think me a wanton woman and dislike me?" Jiang Sxi murmured to herself. The closer they got to the Tianyuan Continent, the more her heart raced uncontrollably.

"I didn't bring anything for this meeting. I wonder if what I brought is enough!" Jiang Sxi kept murmuring.

"Something's happening!" Nan Gong Yuqing's voice interrupted Jiang Sxi's thoughts. Her eyes flashed with icy coldness.

At this moment, they were very close to the Tianyuan Continent. If there was any trouble, it must be something happening in the Tianyuan Continent. Jiang Sxi immediately thought of Luo Tian.

"Accelerate!" Her cold voice echoed, like a royal decree. It spread to the other warships behind her.

"Buzz..." The massive fleet pulled the Eastern Plains continent, speed increasing. They shattered countless stars and rushed toward the Tianyuan Continent.

...

Luo Tian wore a faint smile, sensing Jiang Sxi's arrival. His heart finally relaxed. Taking advantage of Meng Guangxiu's momentary distraction, Luo Tian appeared like a ghost before him. His cold voice echoed: "Daring to be distracted while fighting me?"

Before Luo Tian's words had finished, the cold demonic sword swept through the void. It struck Meng Guangxiu's shoulder with a thunderous impact.

Meng Guangxiu's face turned pale. His eyes showed disbelief as he transformed into a streak of gray light and retreated.

"Is this his true strength?" Meng Guangxiu silently marveled while repairing the broken bones in his body.

Silence fell over the star domain. The elite warriors of the Nether Domain stood frozen, unsure how to speak.

The leader of the Nether Domain had been wounded by a single strike. Who would believe it? Worse still, it was a young man who had injured him. It seemed even more unbelievable that this person had defeated the Nether Domain's leader.

Meng Guangxiu was renowned across the nine great lands of the Nether Domain. His strength needed no explanation. Yet today, he had been wounded. People recalled that Meng Guangxiu's last injury was over ten thousand years ago during the ranking of the Nether Domain's nine great lands. He had suffered a minor wound then.

"Second strike! Third strike!" Luo Tian clearly didn't want to give Meng Guangxiu any chance. He stood beneath the void, and the black blade's radiance rose again. The second and third strikes of the Seven Demonic Blades followed closely.

Meng Guangxiu, a warrior who had ruled the Nether Domain for years, quickly recovered from his injury. He swung his gray sword downward.

Two strikes clashed with Luo Tian's Seven Demonic Blades. A black and a gray torrent collided like fire and water, two dark and gray lightning bolts colliding. The sound of their collision echoed in people's ears again.

"Pu..." Meng Guangxiu, already injured, had fought two more strikes against Luo Tian. His injuries worsened further, and his eyes showed a hint of fear.

"I can't fight anymore. If I continue, I'll be in even worse shape!" Meng Guangxiu's face showed a fierce expression.

Although his son was important, compared to his life, it was more crucial. The selfish nature of the Nether Domain was clearly visible in Meng Guangxiu.

"Everyone, listen! Destroy the Tianyuan Continent for me! Take revenge for Di'er!" Meng Guangxiu's eyes turned blood-red. Meng Di'er was his most beloved son. Now, he had to abandon him, which made Meng Guangxiu extremely upset.

"Yes..." A uniform response echoed as Meng Guangxiu's words ended. A肃杀 atmosphere mixed with the Nether Domain's destructive power spread beneath the starry expanse. A terrifying pressure directly swept toward the people on the Tianyuan Continent, causing even those ten thousand li away to shudder involuntarily.

"Now it's out of your hands!" Luo Tian's lips slightly curled. He watched the massive ancient warships flying toward him.

"Those from the Tianyuan Sect, kill these Nether Domain scum without leaving any survivors!" Luo Tian's voice echoed coldly beneath the starry expanse.

After speaking, Luo Tian rushed toward Meng Guangxiu again. He believed Jiang Sxi and Nan Gong Yuqing would handle everything.

No one dared defy Luo Tian's orders. The people on the warships had already sensed the Nether Domain warriors' strength, especially those from Tiger Fortress and Star River Four Thieves. Their faces showed no tension but instead excitement.

"An opponent worth fighting! It's exhilarating!" Blood-red figures flew from the warships, their faces filled with strong battle spirit. They gazed at the Nether Domain warriors.

"The Four Sacred Star Domains have such elite sects? It's truly unexpected!" The Nether Domain warriors, who had intended to rush into the Tianyuan Continent for slaughter, were suddenly drawn by the appearance of Tiger Fortress and Star River Four Thieves.

One gray and one red, two opposing forces stood like two torrents of water. They faced each other, their eyes locking as if tigers meeting on the mountain.

"Kill..." Both sides spoke simultaneously. Their low growls broke through the stars, forming two stormy forces that collided.

The two torrents surged forward under the word "kill," crushing toward each other.

On another side, Luo Tian wore a cold expression. He provocatively gazed at Meng Guangxiu: "The warm-up is over. Now I'll start to fight seriously!"

"Reverse Seven Demonic Blades! Fourth strike!" A brilliant blade's radiance flashed past. Luo Tian finally unleashed the fourth strike of his Seven Demonic Blades.

The fourth strike would definitely deal a fatal blow to Meng Guangxiu if he was careless.

"I'm already injured. I don't have that kind of power to increase my cultivation. Fighting head-on would only result in heavy injuries! I don't know how many more strikes this kid can unleash!" Meng Guangxiu's face showed a serious expression. His mind constantly pondered how to counter Luo Tian's fourth strike.

"Let's fight!" Meng Guangxiu's face showed a fierce expression. He slapped his dantian, spitting out a mouthful of blood.

As the blood flew out, Meng Guangxiu's mouth seemed to spew an endless river of light. Countless runes凝聚ed together.

At the same time, a powerful pressure emanated from that river of stars. Luo Tian's gaze slightly tightened, his eyes showing a serious expression.

"This is... the pressure of a Sage!" Luo Tian murmured lowly. His body involuntarily trembled slightly. The battlefield where Tiger Fortress and Star River Four Thieves were fighting with the Nether Domain warriors slightly paused.

"The leader has unleashed a Sacred Artifact. This kid must have forced the leader to use it!" The Nether Domain warriors showed shocked expressions. They hadn't expected Meng Guangxiu to use his rarely used secret weapon, the Sacred Artifact granted by the Nine Sacred Beasts of the Nether Domain.

"A Sacred Artifact?" Luo Tian's lips slightly curled. His mind recalled the Sacred Artifact he had obtained by killing Ke Zhen Tian - the Ten Directions Xuan Feather Drum.

"Buzz..." The river of stars reversed, slowly gathering together to form a large ancient copper bell. Stars were embedded in the bell, emitting brilliant light.

"Kid, I suppose you've never heard of Sacred Artifacts before. Do you feel terrified?" Meng Guangxiu's face showed endless pride as he gazed at Luo Tian's fourth strike, which struck the starlight-filled ancient bell.

"Boom..." A thunderous sound echoed. An invisible wave of pressure instantly spread from the ancient bell toward Luo Tian, a terrifying pressure immediately enveloping him. His body slightly bent.

"This ancient bell can reflect my attack, and it's enhanced by a Sacred Artifact!" Luo Tian's eyes slightly narrowed. The roaring sound waves like an ocean surged toward him.

"Kid, this bell was given by the Sage of the Nether Domain. It's called the Infinite Star River Bell. I once used this ancient bell to kill countless warriors from the Four Sacred Star Domains. Today, it's time to kill you. It's your honor!" Meng Guangxiu's face showed endless pride as he gazed at the terrifying waves approaching Luo Tian.

Seeing Meng Guangxiu's proud expression, Luo Tian showed a look of contempt. His eyes flashed with coldness. Facing that terrifying sound wave, he remained calm under the starry expanse. His cold voice made Meng Guangxiu instinctively shiver.

"A Sacred Artifact? Fortunately, I also have one!" Luo Tian sneered. He waved his hand, and a fiery red drum appeared in everyone's sight.

Chapter 852: The Duel of Sacred Artifacts

Above the starry expanse, a bell and a drum stood under the sky. They seemed like two masters of the world facing each other. Both were Sacred Artifacts, both exuding immense power and terrifying pressure.

Seeming to sense the appearance of the Ten Directions Xuan Feather Drum, the stars on the star river bell glowed with brilliant light. The light was not blinding but carried a gentle touch. However, Luo Tian felt an intense killing intent under this light.

When Ke Zhen Tian had used the Ten Directions Xuan Feather Drum at the nine-source Celestial Sovereign level, it had almost trapped Luo Tian in danger. Now, Meng Guangxiu used the Sacred Artifact with his superhuman-level strength. The power was unimaginable, capable of unleashing eight-tenths of the artifact's potential.

"Thankfully, I have the Ten Directions Xuan Feather Drum. Otherwise, today's outcome would be uncertain. Sacred Artifacts are truly powerful!" Luo Tian murmured lowly.

As he spoke, the stars instantly rushed into the sound wave approaching him.

"Boom... Boom..." The starry expanse trembled, as if filled with thunder. Countless green lightning bolts flashed across the sky and fell into the sound wave, making it grow even more terrifying. The overwhelming sound wave continuously surged toward Luo Tian and the Ten Directions Xuan Feather Drum.

"Terrifying! So terrifying!" The three people who had been transferred away by Luo Tian - Gu Lei, Jiang Nanxuan, and Long Jie - showed trembling expressions. They gazed at the direction of Luo Tian's battle, their hearts shaking.

"So powerful! In this terrifying fluctuation, we界的尊境界 people are nothing but dust!" They whispered lowly, their eyes filled with disappointment.

These three had never seen a battle beyond the界尊境界 before. Luo Tian and those he brought were beyond their previous understanding.

Jiang Sxi's gaze on the warship also turned worried. Although the terrifying sound wave was aimed at Luo Tian, it still reached some of the warships, causing the massive ships to sway constantly. The disciples of Tianyuan Sect who weren't participating in the battle were also terrified.

Luo Tian wore a confident expression. Black demonic energy slowly gathered, forming into a massive hammer that emitted a continuous humming sound. He struck the red drum's surface with it.

"Boom... Boom..." The thunderous sound returned. Purple lightning continuously struck the Ten Directions Xuan Feather Drum's surface, and black runes transformed into long dragons that surged across the drum's surface. They created a terrifying sound wave, which rushed toward the star river.

Luo Tian was now a superhuman. He was no longer comparable to Ke Zhen Tian from before. The terrifying fluctuation was no less than the one reflected by the Infinite Star River Bell.

Under the gazes of Luo Tian and Meng Guangxiu, two terrifying energies collided instantly.

The thunderous sound was overwhelming. Stars fell, and the two energies continuously intersected. The invisible fluctuation caused the Tianyuan Continent, the Xian Gu Continent, and the Eastern Plains continent pulled by Jiang Sxi's ancient warships to tremble three times. On these three continents, countless mountains collapsed, and the seas reversed.

Countless ancient warships also trembled violently, swaying in the sky under the residual waves of their collision.

However, Luo Tian and Meng Guangxiu remained unharmed. Their faces showed a deep sense of seriousness.

"A superhuman, truly hard to kill!" Luo Tian felt a headache. He knew that at the moment, he had no way of dealing with Meng Guangxiu. If Meng Guangxiu wanted to escape using the Sacred Artifact, he would be powerless.

Meng Guangxiu's face was still pale. His gaze turned deep, and he had fully realized the situation. Today, he could gain no advantage over Luo Tian.

However, it was a long journey. Meng Guangxiu didn't want to return to the Nether Domain. If he couldn't establish a foundation in the Four Sacred Star Domains, not only would other eight masters mock him, but the nine sages would also be dissatisfied with him.

"What to do?" Meng Guangxiu's mind constantly pondered. Should he continue fighting or retreat immediately?

Compared to Meng Guangxiu's hesitation, Luo Tian was more decisive. His face showed a fierce expression. He slowly gathered black demonic blades in his hands, raising them high. A series of black dragons gradually converged toward the blade.

"Fifth strike! If you can't defeat me, then you may leave!" Luo Tian's deep voice echoed beneath the starry expanse.

The black blade radiance flew from Luo Tian's hands, instantly spreading a terrifying pressure to every corner of the battlefield.

"Powerful! So powerful!" Meng Guangxiu's face showed panic. Without hesitation, he summoned the star river bell in front of him and hid beneath it.

"Let's see if I can withstand this attack. If I do, this kid will be significantly weakened. Then it'll be his time to die!" Standing beneath the Infinite Star River Bell, Meng Guangxiu felt relieved.

The Infinite Star River Bell was a Sacred Artifact. It wouldn't be easily destroyed. And what he faced was the powerful rebound after being blocked by the star river bell. However, in an instant, Meng Guangxiu's eyes showed deep confusion.

In his vision, the black blade radiance that could annihilate a superhuman didn't come toward him but instead struck behind Luo Tian.

"What is he doing? Killing his own people?" Meng Guangxiu's face showed strong confusion.

"No, it's that Sacred Artifact drum!" Meng Guangxiu finally understood Luo Tian's intention. His face showed fear.

The black blade radiance seemed to want to shatter the red Ten Directions Xuan Feather Drum. It collided with it, producing a deafening sound. Even Luo Tian felt his head about to explode.

The Ten Directions Xuan Feather Drum was indeed a Sacred Artifact. Even with all his strength, Luo Tian's fifth strike of the Seven Demonic Blades didn't cause any damage to the drum surface.

The black blade radiance exploded on the drum's surface, as if amplified. It transformed into countless black dragons that surged toward Meng Guangxiu and the star river bell.

A feeling of destroying heaven and earth instantly arose in people's hearts. Wherever the black dragons went, it became a vacuum. A dark passage appeared before people's eyes.

Even Meng Guangxiu beneath the star river bell could no longer remain calm. He could feel a sense of crisis on the star river bell.

"I am the first master of the Nether Domain. How could I be defeated by this kid!" Meng Guangxiu's face showed madness. Facing the threat of death, he no longer held back. His superhuman power fully erupted and struck against the star river bell.

A沉闷 sound of the bell echoed again beneath the starry expanse. Two terrifying energies collided toward each other. However, this time, Luo Tian's black dragon was powerful and completely crushed Meng Guangxiu's sound wave.

In an instant, the two terrifying fluctuations collided under Luo Tian and Meng Guangxiu's gazes.

"This time, you won't make it!" Luo Tian clenched his fists weakly. His eyes showed endless confidence as he watched his black dragon crush Meng Guangxiu's attack and rush toward the Infinite Star River Bell.

"Bad!" Meng Guangxiu saw his counterattack being completely devoured in less than a breath. His eyes showed a hint of fear.

But in the next moment, that destructive black dragon instantly rushed toward the star river bell's body. It enveloped both Meng Guangxiu and the star river bell.

"Is it over?" Luo Tian felt his body becoming weak. He took a long breath. He knew how terrifying that attack had been. A superhuman could not withstand it.

The terrifying fluctuation lasted for thirty breaths before stopping under people's watchful eyes. The massive bell body of the star river was revealed.

Meng Guangxiu's body remained under the star river bell, but his eyes were tightly closed. His whole body was covered in blood, obviously unconscious.

The star river bell, which had previously been dazzlingly bright, was now dim. Luo Tian could even see fine cracks on the bell's surface, which were continuously repairing themselves.

"Finished!" Luo Tian flew toward the star river bell and reached out to strike it.

"Buzz..." But before Luo Tian's hand touched the star river bell, it emitted a series of humming sounds. The stars again surged, carrying Meng Guangxiu within it. It transformed into a meteor and flew out of Luo Tian's sight.

"This... is truly a Sacred Artifact. It can still protect its master!" Luo Tian watched the star river bell's speed, which was incredibly fast. It disappeared from his sight. His face showed disappointment.

A superhuman, without the star river bell, would be an easy target for Luo Tian's first kill. Thinking about it still made him excited.

"Never mind, a superhuman and a Sacred Artifact are indeed difficult to deal with. However, without Meng Guangxiu, these over a million Nether Domain elites will surely suffer!" Luo Tian's face showed a smile. He turned his gaze to another battlefield.

That battlefield was more brutal and exciting than the one between Luo Tian and Meng Guangxiu. Both sides were elite warriors, capable of defeating three opponents each. It was like encountering an ultimate opponent. The Tiger Fortress and Star River Four Thieves, who had never lost before, now suffered heavy casualties.

"Damn it! Where did these guys come from? They can match us evenly!" Tu Hongfei cursed, tearing apart a five-source Celestial Sovereign who wore an intense look of fear.

Although the opponent was torn apart, his teeth still clung tightly to Tu Hongfei's arm. Tu Hongfei shook it several times before finally shaking it off.

Others also nodded in agreement, continuously fighting with the Nether Domain elites.

Tu Hongfei and others didn't know that the Nether Domain elites were also shocked, and their hearts felt even more bitter.

Chapter 853: Want to Go to the Nether Domain?

Beneath the endless starry expanse, two fierce groups of people continuously fought each other. They seemed like two waves of beasts, constantly biting at each other.

Luo Tian wore a look of pity and also admiration. He marveled at the strength of the Nether Domain elites.

Luo Tian knew Tiger Fortress and Star River Four Thieves. Since they were released from the Tiger Fortress, they had never suffered such heavy losses before. Even Tu Hongfei and Ren Hongzhe had sustained serious injuries.

Nan Gong Yuqing's robe was stained with blood. His eyes carried a cold and ruthless intent. He fought three nine-source Celestial Sovereigns, his blood qi extremely dense. His crimson sword continuously swung, and the three surrounded him in a coordinated attack. However, he suppressed them to the point of being unable to lift their heads.

"Seems Nan Gong Yuqing has made progress these days. With the understanding of superhuman, he's entered a half-superhuman state!" Luo Tian looked at Nan Gong Yuqing with a sigh, murmuring lowly.

"Cut it out. I'm still nine-source!" Jiang Sxi stood before Luo Tian, showing a defiant expression.

"Yes, yes. You're also a great talent!" Luo Tian smiled lightly and gently patted Jiang Sxi's small belly.

"Luotian, who is this?" As they spoke, Gu Lei, Jiang Nanxuan, and Long Jie arrived before Luo Tian with surprised expressions. Their eyes looked at Jiang Sxi as they asked.

Hearing Gu Lei's curious gaze, Luo Tian's face froze. He didn't know how to respond. Gu Lei was his brother-in-law. During his absence, he had a child with another person. If this reached Gu Qianshu and Leng Qiuchan's ears, those two strong-willed girls would never be able to bear it.

"This... " Luo Tian's face was awkward. His eyes showed regret, and he stared at Jiang Sxi for a while.

The three were extremely sharp. Seeing Luo Tian's situation, their faces slightly changed. Their eyes carried a scrutinizing look at Jiang Sxi without caring about her terrifying cultivation.

Jiang Nanxuan and Long Jie also looked at Jiang Sxi. When they saw Luo Tian's slightly swollen belly, their faces showed a strange expression.

"Good for you, brother. It's been years since you almost became a father! How are you going to explain it to my sister?" Gu Lei's face showed mockery. He pulled Luo Tian forward, his eyes showing a smile.

"I don't know!" Luo Tian slapped his forehead. He had forgotten about this after returning to the Tianyuan Continent.

"What's wrong? Is there a problem?" Jiang Sxi's face also turned cold. Her eyes looked at Luo Tian, subtly showing a threatening expression.

What was Jiang Sxi's status? When she had heard about Gu Qianshu and Leng Qiuchan, she had barely held back her anger toward Luo Tian. Now seeing Luo Tian's expression, her anger rose again, and her face turned serious.

"Nothing, nothing!" Seeing Jiang Sxi's dark expression, Luo Tian quickly comforted her.

"I'll take you to meet my parents later. I believe they will be happy to see you!" Luo Tian smiled.

"But first, I need to finish this matter. These Nether Domain guys are really tough. I'll fight to reduce our losses!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a worried expression, gazing at the battlefield that had become extremely brutal.

At this moment, both sides had entered a state of complete heat. The number of casualties was immense. Seeing the elite warriors from the Tianyuan Continent falling one after another, Luo Tian's heart trembled.

As time passed, their side had lost nearly 300,000 people. Meanwhile, the Nether Domain's side had suffered even heavier losses due to Meng Guangxiu's escape. Nearly half of them were killed by the Tiger Fortress and Star River Four Thieves.

Luo Tian's feet flashed with black light, instantly appearing on the battlefield. His powerful superhuman pressure immediately spread across the battlefield, causing the Nether Domain warriors to be startled and showing fear.

They had clearly seen Luo Tian's strength before. Even the leader Meng Guangxiu hadn't been able to match him, and he had been severely injured and unconscious. They were no match for Luo Tian.

"What to do?" The Nether Domain elites all looked confused, unsure of what to do. They wanted to flee but couldn't. Fighting back was impossible due to the overwhelming disparity in strength.

Surrender? They were Nether Domain elites. How could they lower their pride and surrender unless Luo Tian actively recruited them? That would be a disgrace.

The Nether Domain warriors had already decided to surrender. They weren't fools. The disparity in strength was too great, and they would be completely wiped out eventually.

"Buzz..." As the Nether Domain warriors were confused, Luo Tian had already appeared on the battlefield with his black demonic sword. The sword's radiance suddenly expanded, and the third strike of the Seven Demonic Blades directly struck the Nether Domain warriors.

"Impossible to dodge or resist!" The Nether Domain warriors, at the level of Celestial Sovereigns, had no time to react or fight back against a superhuman's strike.

"Pu..." A powerful strike cleaved through the void, slicing into the Nether Domain warriors' group.

The black blade radiance flashed like a reaper's scythe, beginning to harvest the lives of Nether Domain warriors in large numbers. Cries echoed throughout the starry expanse.

Luo Tian's strike had already turned several tens of thousands of Nether Domain elites into souls drifting in the starry expanse.

"Good!" The warriors from Tiger Fortress and Star River Four Thieves, seeing the power of Luo Tian's strike, showed excitement. Their morale instantly soared.

On the other hand, the Nether Domain warriors' faces showed fear. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to still be so powerful after fighting with Meng Guangxiu. Their desire to surrender became even stronger.

"How can we fight? If this kid swings a few more strikes, they'll all be sent to the afterlife!" The Nether Domain warriors muttered lowly. Their eyes showed fear as they looked at Luo Tian.

"Little ancestor, hurry up and accept our surrender. If you just speak, we'll surrender!" The Nether Domain warriors looked at Luo Tian with pleading eyes.

"Huh?" Luo Tian felt the Nether Domain warriors' gazes. His face showed confusion, then he smiled slightly: "They want to surrender!"

"Want to surrender? Dream on!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness. His black demonic sword gathered again, and a thunderous blade radiance struck into the Nether Domain warriors' group. Another several tens of thousands of Nether Domain elites died under Luo Tian's blade.

At this moment, the Nether Domain warriors were still fighting with the Tiger Fortress and Star River Four Thieves. Their numbers kept decreasing. After Luo Tian's two strikes, their number had dropped to 300,000.

"I surrender..." Finally, a six-source Celestial Sovereign from the Nether Domain shouted loudly. His eyes showed fear as he gazed at Luo Tian in the sky.

"I also surrender... I am too..." As if lighting a fuse, the sound of surrender kept rising among the Nether Domain army.

Pride? Pride was worthless in front of life. The Nether Domain warriors had originally wanted Luo Tian to actively accept their surrender, but now after these two strikes from Luo Tian, they had given up all hope. They feared the next strike would fall on themselves.

One by one, the Nether Domain warriors looked at Luo Tian with pleading eyes. He was like a demon in the sky, waiting for his reply.

"Don't need to!" Luo Tian's cold voice echoed. He waved his hand, and the black blade radiance swept down, striking into the Nether Domain warriors' group.

"Huh?" Everyone under the starry expanse looked at Luo Tian with confusion. They didn't understand why he wouldn't accept these people.

These Nether Domain warriors were clearly elites. They could match the Tiger Fortress and Star River Four Thieves evenly. Such powerful people would significantly elevate Luo Tian's power.

But this man, in front of such a force, chose to continue killing. This confused everyone.

Another strike killed several tens of thousands of people. Luo Tian's eyes still showed no decrease in killing intent. The black blade radiance gathered again.

"Why... why..." The Nether Domain warriors shouted, their eyes showing resentment. They had already lowered their pride and surrendered. The three words "don't need to" made them feel like they had been thrown into hell.

"Alright, I'll tell you why. It's because of the countless crimes your Nether Domain committed against the Tianyuan Continent. Most of you have blood on your hands from the ancestors of the Tianyuan Continent!"

"It's because you wanted to destroy my hometown, the Tianyuan Continent again. Although it didn't succeed, I can't allow such thoughts!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a ruthless intent. The black blade radiance took more Nether Domain warriors, and his cold voice echoed beneath the starry expanse. The Nether Domain people felt complete despair.

However, at this moment, the Nether Domain warriors had no will to fight back. Luo Tian's strikes had already scattered them, leaving only tens of thousands left. The Tiger Fortress and Star River Four Thieves were several times more than the Nether Domain warriors. Even if they were extraordinary, they couldn't change the outcome.

In just a moment, the Nether Domain warriors were completely wiped out. The three nine-source Celestial Sovereigns were also sliced into three clumps of blood mist by Nan Gong Yuqing and absorbed into his crimson sword.

"What should we do next?" Nan Gong Yuqing, covered in blood, appeared before Luo Tian and asked.

"Want to go to the Nether Domain for a walk?" Luo Tian gazed at the Tianyuan Continent. Finally, he turned his gaze to the book of the era that continuously flowed with blood.

Chapter 854: Reunion

Beneath the endless starry expanse, Tianyuan Sect disciples were busy cleaning up the battlefield outside the Tianyuan Continent.

Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing stood on the ancient warships, waiting for the battlefield to be cleaned. Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Nan Gong Yuqing's face turned serious.

"Really go to the Nether Domain?" Nan Gong Yuqing spoke seriously, causing Li Tianzhi and others who had just returned to Luo Tian's side to pause.

Although they didn't know how powerful the Nether Domain was, they knew it was the strongest among the nine domains. From the Nether Domain warriors who had just emerged, they were indeed as rumored - extremely powerful.

Entering the Nether Domain would mean encountering unknown dangers. The unknown was always terrifying.

"We'll just walk around the outskirts. Don't go deep in. It shouldn't be a problem. After all, it's a rare opportunity to explore the Nether Domain. We can't waste it!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a hint of worry, thinking about the nine sages in the Nether Domain. He didn't know when they would appear.

"Okay!" Nan Gong Yuqing said nothing but showed a supportive expression. He nodded to Luo Tian.

"Luo Tian, don't go. Maybe wait until we're stronger before going!" Gu Lei and others showed worried expressions, trying to stop him.

"Don't worry. With my strength, there should be no problem!"

"For years, it's always the Nether Domain invading us. Now it's our turn to stir up trouble in the Nether Domain!" Lu Tian spoke softly, his voice carrying a hint of killing intent.

"Let's go!" Seeing the battlefield was cleaned up, Luo Tian spoke to his army and led them forward into the Tianyuan Continent.

"Yes!" A uniform response echoed from the ancient warships. Figures flew out, respectfully standing behind Jiang Sxi, as she was currently the sect leader of Tianyuan Sect.

A large group rushed into the Tianyuan Continent, stopping in the sky above it.
