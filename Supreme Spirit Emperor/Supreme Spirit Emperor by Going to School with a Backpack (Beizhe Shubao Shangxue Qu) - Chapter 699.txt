The elders and disciples of the Wheel Turning Sect went to search. The sect had many disciples; if they truly searched, it would be troublesome, but that did not mean they could not find them.

"Then shall the duel continue?" a Celestial Lord spoke, his gaze turning to Luo Tian seated there. That spear strike had cost him dearly; furthermore, he had already suffered heavy wounds. At this moment, Luo Tian was at his absolute weakest.

Hearing the Celestial Lord's words, people turned their gazes toward Luo Tian, frowning slightly.

"Luo Tian, surrender! The Fengdu Sect can accept the Tianyuan Sect. We merely need you to change your name, not disband the Tianyuan Sect!" Ye Qiu addressed Luo Tian. At this moment, even if Luo Tian won, it would be an unjust victory.

"Can I substitute for my elder brother and fight you?" Chen Zhanbiao stepped beside Luo Tian, his breath heavy. Seeing Luo Tian wounded had ignited his ferocity.

"It must be Luo Tian. This was decided by the elder of the Ten Palaces and your Tianyuan Sect's master. Orders are orders; if not for this, I would not fight!" Ye Qiu shook his head gently.

"Fight your grandfather! I'll kill both of you first!" Chen Zhanbiao was straightforward. He took a bold step forward and charged directly at Ye Qiu.

"Stay calm, stay calm!" As Chen Zhanbiao took his first step, the Celestial Lords of the Wheel Turning Sect, including Jueying, blocked him with a flurry of hands.

"Get out of my way!" Chen Zhanbiao roared, struggling with his limbs.

"Zhanbiao, have you already become friends with these people?" Amid the chaos, a weak voice echoed in their ears.

A figure slowly rose, leaning on the Cracking Heaven Spear, drawing everyone's attention to Luo Tian.

"Senior Brother!" Chen Zhanbiao heard Luo Tian's words and immediately stopped, rushing to his side.

"I can still fight. Let's go!" Luo Tian addressed Ye Qiu and Wang Xiu. His words silenced everyone.

"How is it possible? He's so wounded, truly challenging!" The disciples of the Wheel Turning Sect gazed at Luo Tian. At this moment, Luo Tian deserved respect.

"If the Wheel Turning Sect faces hardship, I would sacrifice myself for it, pouring my very last drop of blood!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze turning to the disciples. He still held affection for the Wheel Turning Sect.

"Luo Xiong is truly admirable. If so, then let us fight. Even if Luo Xiong loses, I will persuade my Fengdu Sect Lord to preserve the Tianyuan Sect!"

"Additionally, if I wield two swords, it counts as my defeat," Ye Qiu spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian with admiration.

"I am the same. I will strike but once; if you can withstand it, then I shall count as defeated. Though this contradicts my principles," Wang Xiu spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Everyone, disperse!" Luo Tian addressed them all, retrieving two pills and swallowing them to recover his wounds. However, he had already expended two drops of essence blood.

Weakness enveloped him; his body felt hollow, but he could not retreat. This was the sole opportunity for the Tianyuan Sect, and he would never surrender it easily.

"Everyone, find the bastard who attacked the four Grand Disciples!" The disciples of the Wheel Turning Sect roared, furious. If not for Luo Tian's intervention, their condition would have been far better. The entire sect of disciples became enraged, beginning to search for the one who had secretly attacked the four Grand Disciples.

Chapter 2620: Battle Against Ye Qiu

On the arena, three figures stood. Others had already descended from the platform; the corpses of Wu Xingwen and four others were carried away by Du Jianhang.

Due to prior circumstances, Du Jianhang and his group decided to restore the four corpses' bodies and rejoin their souls with their flesh, minimizing damage.

Meanwhile, the disciples of the Wheel Turning Sect moved into action, continuously searching for the one who had secretly attempted to kill the four Grand Disciples.

Luo Tian panted heavily, gazing at Ye Qiu and Wang Xiu. His arms trembled slightly but he still raised the Cracking Heaven Spear.

"Are you truly determined to fight again?" Ye Qiu sighed, observing Luo Tian's deteriorated state.

"No problem!" Luo Tian chuckled softly, his Fallen Heaven Twin Wings vibrating behind him. His figure vanished from the spot and reappeared beside Ye Qiu, thrusting his spear forward.

A streak of black cold light appeared before Ye Qiu, but Ye Qiu's face bore a smile. He raised his Jueyun Sword and placed it before him.

The sword met the spear, and Ye Qiu remained in place. The black spear bent slightly while Luo Tian took two steps back, silently sighing.

"You've declined too much; you're no longer my match. Even if I wielded one hand, you wouldn't be my opponent!" Ye Qiu spoke softly. This Luo Tian was no longer worth his effort.

Wang Xiu remained still, gazing at Luo Tian without a word.

"Indeed! Your strength has declined too much; your speed and power are but two-tenths of their peak!" Luo Tian muttered to himself.

The onlookers also expressed admiration. If not for Luo Tian's injuries, this battle would have been spectacular. In their eyes, Ye Qiu was undoubtedly the top among the younger generation of Hell, with Wang Xiu second.

However, since the Ten Palaces' Grand Tournament, people had regarded Luo Tian as the top among the younger generation. They knew Ye Qiu and Wang Xiu were not content with this.

Hum...

As people discussed, Luo Tian's hands moved swiftly, and a dragon of black runes encircled him.

A thunderous sound echoed within Luo Tian's body, and his most powerful technique, the Tianmo Dissolution, was unleashed.

"Alas..." Chen Zhanbiao sighed longingly as he watched Luo Tian unleash the Tianmo Dissolution. He was no fool; he knew that if Luo Tian used this technique, it meant his final stand. Chen Zhanbiao was more concerned about the aftereffects of Luo Tian's Tianmo Dissolution, as his weakness would last for a long time. He was unsure if he could protect Luo Tian within Hell.

Although the disciples of the Wheel Turning Sect seemed to treat Luo Tian well, Chen Zhanbiao trusted no one, not even these Celestial Lords who had become his brothers.

With a thunderous roar, Luo Tian's aura began to strengthen, though his condition was still extremely poor.

Even with the Tianmo Dissolution, Luo Tian had only recovered four-tenths of his strength. If he were at his peak, he might have reached the late stage of Immortal King.

"Kill..." As his aura stabilized, Luo Tian let out a low growl and rushed toward Ye Qiu.

The Breaking Void Spear technique was unleashed; in an instant, a black spear shadow appeared before Ye Qiu. Ye Qiu's face finally changed, and he thrust his sword forward with his right hand.

"Crush..." In an instant, the spear tip met the sword tip, sparks flying. Both weapons bent slightly as Luo Tian and Ye Qiu were thrown backward.

Their feet left deep traces on the ground, their gazes locking onto each other. At the same time, Wang Xiu's figure vanished without a trace, hiding in the shadows to deliver a decisive strike against Luo Tian.

"This is more interesting!"

"Unleash your Longyuan Sword; otherwise, you won't have a chance to defeat me!" Ye Qiu turned his sword, and a cloud of swords rose above him. The sword cloud floated toward Luo Tian.

The sword cloud drifted and hovered over Luo Tian's head, releasing a torrent of sky-shaking sword energy. It seemed like rain, descending upon Luo Tian with a slashing force.

"Give me something fresh!" Luo Tian frowned as he watched the sword rain. This technique had already been tested before; it was not Ye Qiu's strongest move.

Though he said this, Luo Tian did not relax. He channeled his cultivation into the Fallen Heaven Twin Wings on his back.

Thunder and lightning roared, two wings vibrating. One unleashed a storm, the other thunderous lightning.

Storms mixed with lightning surged upward, sweeping across heaven and earth toward the sword cloud above. The thunderous storm clashed with the descending sword energy, leaving Luo Tian untouched.

The sky-piercing storm collided with the sword cloud above, and a series of deafening explosions echoed across the heavens. It was like fireworks being set off, but the sound was a thousand times louder.

The storm surged forward as Luo Tian and Ye Qiu darted toward each other again.

Their collision echoed, a spear against a sword, clashing repeatedly. Each clash shook the heavens and earth.

"Six Paths of Reincarnation Sword!" After clashing over a hundred times, Ye Qiu unleashed his sword technique. It was his ultimate skill.

Six swords of energy erupted, radiating a world-shaking aura. Each carried the power to destroy heaven and earth.

"Five Stages of Sword Dao!" Du Jianhang exclaimed, gazing at Ye Qiu with disbelief.

"Five Stages of Sword Dao?" Hearing Du Jianhang's words, everyone's faces bore shock. They had not expected Ye Qiu's sword mastery to have reached the fifth stage.

Combined with the Six Paths of Reincarnation Sword, its power was unimaginable. Luo Tian's eyes also bore a serious expression.

"Mo Ming Armor!" Black demonic energy surged, enveloping Luo Tian in a shadowy figure. The shadow clenched its fist, and six whirlwinds rose from the fist—Six Paths of Reincarnation Fist.

"Again that move!" People's eyes lit up with excitement as the shadow clenched its fist, rushing toward the six interwoven sword energies.

"Same Six Paths of Reincarnation power—whose is stronger?" People's eyes brimmed with anticipation as the fist collided with the sword energy.

In an instant, the black fist met the first sword energy, and a deafening explosion echoed across heaven and earth. The heavens trembled, winds reversed.

The entire arena shook violently; the second sword energy followed swiftly, exploding and shattering the platform beneath them. Shattered stones flew outward, colliding with the barrier, which cracked extensively.

Boom... Boom... Three more explosions echoed, and the barrier began to crack as well. A wild surge of energy swept across heaven and earth. Du Jianhang and others quickly acted, channeling the force into the void.

Chapter 2621: Decisive Strike

The storm was drawn into the void, and people watched in awe as Luo Tian and Ye Qiu clashed.

However, despite the six paths of reincarnation fists unleashed by Luo Tian's chaotic wind, one path of reincarnation sword still flew toward him.

"Jiuyu Ghost Claw!" Luo Tian pressed his hand, striking the void fiercely. A thunderous roar followed as ghostly claws descended upon the world-ending sword.

"No use!" Ye Qiu spoke softly, standing still as the ghostly claws collided with the sword.

The ghostly claws were pierced and exploded, continuing to strike Luo Tian.

"This Ye Qiu has restrained his strength!" Du Jianhang sighed, gazing at Ye Qiu.

"Ye Qiu is strong, but Luo Tian isn't a pushover. Even in this state, he could withstand five paths of reincarnation swords!" Jueying and other Celestial Lords sighed in admiration. In their eyes, if Luo Tian were at his peak, Ye Qiu would not be a match. This had been evident since the Ten Palaces' Grand Tournament.

"Even if Ye Qiu and his group fought together, Luo Tian might have had a fifty-fifty chance!" Other Celestial Lords spoke. The Luo Tian of that time was dazzling, and now he had become a true powerhouse.

"He has paid much," Du Jianhang sighed, understanding that strength was not easily gained.

It could be said Luo Tian had been fortunate with opportunities, but if it were anyone else, they might have died countless times. Sometimes, luck was also a form of strength.

"How can he withstand this sword?" People watched Luo Tian, hoping for another miracle.

"Longxiang Sealing Prison!" Luo Tian spoke softly, not intending to use the Broken Sword Destroying Heaven. This was his decision made while fishing in the Pangu Lake.

Though the Broken Sword Destroying Heaven's power was formidable, it affected Luo Tian's spear technique. He would not use it unless absolutely necessary.

Roar...

Four dragons and four elephants suddenly flew out, appearing above Luo Tian's head. A black dragon coiled around the elephant, descending from the sky with a mighty aura to suppress the sword.

Longxiang Sealing Prison, a martial art passed down by Longque to Luo Tian. This grand name was specifically aimed at Hell, so when Hell's ghost cultivators encountered it, they would be suppressed.

A powerful pressure made Ye Qiu's face slightly tense. He had previously lost to this move, feeling its immense pressure. Even now as an Immortal King in the middle stage, he had to be cautious.

Boom...

As people marveled, one dragon and one elephant suppressed the remaining path of reincarnation sword. A thunderous explosion followed.

Buzz...

A surge of energy rose, and Ye Qiu's eyes flashed with intense light. White light flickered, and his eyes gradually lost focus, turning white.

"Yin-Yang Eye!" Everyone gasped, watching his eyes turn white.

"How did the Yin-Yang Eye end up on Ye Qiu?" Fan Tianyin and others's faces changed, puzzled as to why.

"Luoshengmen!"

"I heard Ye Qiu had also been attacked by Luoshengmen before. That attack left him bloodied and returning to Fengdu Sect!"

"Along with Ye Qiu, Bai Ming was also attacked," Wu Xingwen spoke, gazing at Ye Qiu.

As people puzzled, Ye Qiu moved without breaking his promise, still holding the sword with one hand. He swung his long sword, and a torrent of sword energy shot out instantly.

The Sword Domain opened, countless swords swirling around Ye Qiu as if they were his loyal subjects.

Sword energy surged, instantly flying toward the three dragons and three elephants. Each sword slashed into the massive forms of the dragons and elephants.

"Does the Yin-Yang Eye find the weakness of Longxiang Sealing Prison?" Luo Tian muttered to himself, watching sword energy pierce through the three dragons and elephants.

The three dragons and elephants were shattered by countless sword energies, and Ye Qiu stood still, gazing at Luo Tian.

"I defeated you with this move before; how could I not find a way to counter it?"

"This Yin-Yang Eye came from Bai Ming. After Bai Ming's death, he left this eye to me!" Ye Qiu spoke softly, his voice carrying sorrow. He gazed at the flowing demonic energy striking him.

"Bai Ming is dead?" Luo Tian's eyes widened in disbelief, not expecting Bai Ming to have died.

Bai Ming's strength was known to Luo Tian; he was no less than a Grand Disciple of one palace. His Yin-Yang Eye was unparalleled. Luo Tian had not expected Bai Ming to be dead.

"A true prodigy has fallen!" Luo Tian sighed softly, but this was something he had seen many times. He had witnessed countless brilliant prodigies and their falls, even having slain many geniuses himself. The title of "Genius Killer" was not without reason.

"Again!" Luo Tian spoke, stepping on the ground again, his eyes flashing with thunderous light. He took another step forward, rushing toward Ye Qiu.

"Voice Martial Art?" Ye Qiu remained calm, striking a sword energy and retreating.

"Do you know?" Luo Tian's eyes showed slight surprise, deflecting the sword energy and stopping. The demonic energy gathered at his throat also faded. Luo Tian had indeed intended to use a voice martial art.

"You can't defeat me in this state, and besides, Wang Xiu hasn't fought yet!" As Luo Tian was surprised, Ye Qiu raised his Jueyun Sword again and struck three sword energies.

"It's not certain!" Luo Tian swung his spear, retreating and flashing golden light in his eyes. The three sword energies were shattered by Luo Tian.

Ye Qiu had the Yin-Yang Eye, but Luo Tian also possessed the Lei Yang Eyes. Ye Qiu's simple attacks could not harm Luo Tian.

"Can you predict all my attacks?" Luo Tian muttered softly, gray mist gathering from his head, forming a soul spear.

At the same time, a gray shadow appeared, gripping the gray soul spear. Its speed increased dramatically as it rushed toward Ye Qiu.

"Souls!" Ye Qiu's face finally changed; he could perceive the demonic energy within Luo Tian but not his soul.

In an instant, the gray soul appeared before Ye Qiu, and Luo Tian's Breaking Void Spear struck. A powerful pressure made Bai Ming extremely nervous.

"Stop it!" Bai Ming roared, and a gray soul appeared as well. A white shadow emerged from the Jueyun Sword, forming into a sword shape and landing in Bai Ming's soul hand. It rushed toward the gray soul spear.

"Apologies!" At that moment, Wang Xiu finally spoke, appearing behind Luo Tian like a venomous snake. His claws transformed into two fangs and rushed toward Luo Tian's throat.

Wang Xiu was an elite killer; if he wanted to kill someone, it was relatively easy. However, if the target knew of his intent, he would have to expend much more effort.

Especially now, the target was Luo Tian, a person who had been hunted for years and possessed extreme combat experience.

"If I hadn't known of your existence, it might have been troublesome. But since I know you're hiding, there's no longer much threat!" Luo Tian's face was pale. He split half his soul to attack Ye Qiu, making himself even weaker.

Almost instantly after Wang Xiu appeared, Luo Tian opened his mouth and sucked in a vortex. Time and space twisted, creating a powerful suction force that made Wang Xiu's face change.

The martial art of the War God Xingtian, "Swallow Heaven"!

Wang Xiu felt as if he were in a vortex. His hand was nearly at Luo Tian's throat, just needing to extend slightly more to grasp it and snap Luo Tian's neck.

But that was so close, yet he felt like it was out of reach—unable to grasp Luo Tian.

"Roar..." As Wang Xiu was shocked, the vortex suddenly stopped. Luo Tian let out a roar, and a thunderous voice with divine power echoed from his mouth.

The void trembled; the powerful impact instantly struck Wang Xiu, sending him flying backward. Blood gushed from his seven orifices immediately.

His body flew back, and Wang Xiu's face bore disbelief as he gazed at Luo Tian standing there.

On the other side, the gray soul spear also collided with the white sword soul. The collision caused Ye Qiu's body to tremble violently; just one attack had nearly expelled his soul from his body.

Boom...

Wang Xiu's body fell, landing on the arena platform. His eyes still bore shock as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"I have lost!" Wang Xiu shook his head. He had previously said that if he did not defeat Luo Tian, it would count as his loss.

"That's good!" Luo Tian held the Cracking Heaven Spear and flew forward, approaching Ye Qiu. Meanwhile, the other half of his soul continued to fight against Ye Qiu.

Buzz...

The black Cracking Heaven Spear was raised by Luo Tian and smashed toward Ye Qiu.

"Splitting his soul into two—how strong is his soul? One fights Ye Qiu, while the other controls his body to attack!" People erupted again. Luo Tian's strength had exceeded everyone's expectations.

Ye Qiu also felt extremely uncomfortable. If he withdrew his soul, Luo Tian's soul attack would severely injure him. Soul matters were no small thing.

If he did not withdraw his soul, with the souls remaining in his body, it would be difficult to control his body and block Luo Tian's attack.

However, Ye Qiu had little time left. In an instant, the black spear appeared above Ye Qiu's head, and a powerful pressure made his face show bitterness.

Finally, Ye Qiu raised both hands to lift the Jueyun Sword and collided it with the black spear.

Crack...

A thunderous sound echoed, and Luo Tian's body was pushed back. At the same time, the gray soul instantly returned to Luo Tian's body.

Cough... Cough...

Luo Tian spat blood, gazing at Ye Qiu standing there with a difficult expression. His body still stood firm.

"I have lost!" Ye Qiu spoke, gazing at Luo Tian. His condition was also not good.

"Victory!" A gasp echoed through the Wheel Turning Sect, as disciples gazed at Luo Tian standing straight. It seemed to say he could still fight.

"Too ruthless, Grand Disciple! Do you still need tea-serving maids?" A group of female disciples from the Wheel Turning Sect shouted, faces full of admiration.

Defeating eight Grand Disciples alone without a loss—what an outstanding achievement! It was truly exhilarating, and even those who witnessed it felt extremely fortunate.

At this moment, Luo Tian was exceptionally radiant. He gazed at the people's reverent eyes and smiled slightly. He had not felt so triumphant in a long time.

"Senior Brother!" Chen Zhanbiao stepped forward to Luo Tian's side, cautiously gazing around.

"Nothing is wrong. Since I have won, please let everyone return and deliver a message!" Luo Tian addressed Ye Qiu and others.

At the same time, Hei Bai Chang and Bai Lian also contacted the Ten Palaces' Palace Masters, reappearing in that space.

"Black and White, did it end so quickly?" Wu Hua Palace Master spoke, a smile on his face. He had thought it was impossible for Luo Tian to defeat eight Grand Disciples.

"Yes, the result is in. Luo Tian has won!" Seeing everyone's mocking expressions, Hei Bai Chang and Bai Lian remained calm but their voices carried smugness.

"What!"

"How is that possible!" Hearing Hei Bai Chang and Bai Lian's words, the Ten Palaces' Palace Masters also gasped. They admitted Luo Tian was strong but had not expected him to be this strong.

After the gasps came silence; the Ten Palaces' Palace Masters bore contemplative expressions, their thoughts unknown.

"What do you think? The result is here; will you accept it or not?" Hei Bai Chang spoke, guessing the Ten Palaces' Palace Masters' hesitation but not mentioning it directly.

"I disagree!" Huangtian Palace Master spoke, although there had been a promise before, he still was unwilling to let Luo Tian have it so easily.

"I also disagree!" Three more Palace Masters spoke, but why they disagreed was known only to themselves.

"I also think it's too hasty; maybe Ye Qiu and the others held back!" Nine Palace Masters spoke one after another, playing tricks.

"Hmph!" Hei Bai Chang coldly watched them but said nothing.

"However, I think there's still room for discussion. If they want to exist, they must contribute to Hell!"

"Luoshengmen has been so brazen as to repeatedly assassinate our Ten Palaces' Grand Disciples. I think we should teach them a lesson!"

"If the Tianyuan Sect can eliminate Luoshengmen, showing loyalty, we might allow them to continue existing," Ye Fengdu finally spoke, shifting the topic to Luoshengmen.

Now, Luoshengmen had completely caught their attention. The current situation in Hell was excellent; it seemed they were about to seize the middle three heavens of the Immortal Realm. However, Luoshengmen was like a venomous tumor in Hell; if not eradicated, it would spread throughout the body.

In their eyes, Tianyuan Sect's strength was strong and could serve as a blade for Hell to cut off this tumor. Although the tumor was tough, it was a blade they had found and could be destroyed without regret.

"You are truly overstepping!" Hei Bai Chang spoke solemnly, but the other Palace Masters did not care.

Chapter 2623: Deadline

In the grand Wheel Turning Sect, on the sixty-sixth floor's courtyard, Luo Tian stood there with a smile. Behind him were three towering figures.

One was Chen Zhanbiao; the other two were Da Niu and Er Niu, who had returned from the Immortal Realm battlefield. These two youths had been taken from the Ghost Marsh and Shen Yin Village.

They had remained with Luo Tian in the Wheel Turning Sect, later sent to the Immortal Realm battlefield by Du Jianhang for training. Upon hearing Luo Tian's return, they had insisted on returning to the Wheel Turning Sect despite their mission. Due to this, they had delayed for a while and just returned.

No longer naive, Da Niu and Er Niu had grown significantly; although their strength was still at the Immortal King's initial stage, Luo Tian could sense a dangerous aura from them.

Two days had passed since Luo Tian's battle with the Ten Palaces' Grand Disciples. Though he showed no visible injuries, his body was weak, and his voice could not be used.

Chen Zhanbiao, Da Niu, and Er Niu never left Luo Tian's side, protecting his safety.

Luo Tian had spent these two days idly in the Wheel Turning Sect, occasionally accompanying Fu Xingxuan and giving guidance to Da Niu and Er Niu.

"Luotian!" As Luo Tian and the three of them just sat down to eat, Hei Bai Chang's voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears, causing his body to slightly pause.

A surge of energy rose; Luo Tian's soul was pulled again, a fragment of his soul drawn into that space.

"Has there been a result?" Luo Tian muttered to himself, standing there and gazing at the Ten Palaces' Palace Masters.

The Ten Palaces' Palace Masters had varied expressions, scanning Luo Tian's body. Luo Tian observed their expressions, a bad premonition forming in his heart.

"Kid, I never thought you could be this strong!" One Palace Master spoke, his gaze filled with admiration.

"You have let us win," Luo Tian quickly bowed in response.

"Don't say that; since you won, it's your ability!" Ye Fengdu smiled.

"Then please honor the promise you made before," Luo Tian's face turned serious, not wanting to discuss other topics.

"Don't rush; we will keep our promise. However, before that, we have a question to ask you!" Huangtian Palace Master smiled coldly.

"What is it?" Facing the Huangtian Palace Master who had taken a hostile stance, Luo Tian would not give him a good face.

Luo Tian had seen Huangtian Palace Master enter the Ghost Marsh before, and he wore Luoshengmen's attire. Luo Tian did not trust Huangtian Palace Master, believing he was connected to Luoshengmen.

However, Luo Tian could not say it out loud; even if he did, these Palace Masters would not believe him.

"Does your Tianyuan Sect truly have the intention to submit to Hell?" Ku Shen Palace Master spoke, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Senior, I think you've misunderstood. My and Wang's master meant that the Tianyuan Sect would remain independent, like the Eight Heavenly Kings. Since the Heaven Ghost King is gone, the Tianyuan Sect can replace his position!" Luo Tian quickly spoke.

Luo Tian felt these old men might play tricks, as the initiative was now in their hands. Just one Wang Duantian could not control these Palace Masters.

"Your conditions are acceptable, but we also have a condition for you to complete. If you do so, then the Tianyuan Sect will become the eighth Heavenly King of Hell!" One Palace Master spoke, smiling at Luo Tian.

"Please explain clearly," Luo Tian muttered internally, gazing at the Palace Masters excluding Hei Bai Chang.

At this point, Luo Tian had somewhat understood; these people wanted to eliminate him but feared Wang Duantian's reaction.

Luo Tian had defeated their Grand Disciples, proving his strength. Now he was at the middle stage of Immortal King; if he advanced to the peak, it would be a disaster. The Ten Palaces' rule would face threats.

"Luoshengmen, recently Luoshengmen has been very brazen. Since the Tianyuan Sect wants to join Hell, you must show your sincerity and contribute to Hell by eliminating Luoshengmen!"

"Of course, you can also choose to refuse. However, you should know the consequences," Huangtian Palace Master spoke, gazing at Luo Tian with disdain. If not for fearing Wang Duantian, he would have no interest in talking to Luo Tian.

"Luoshengmen!" Hearing Huangtian Palace Master's words, Luo Tian fell silent, his eyes flashing with coldness. However, he lowered his head, and no one noticed.

"Of course, you shouldn't think of evading it. There must be a deadline. We hope to see no more Luoshengmen in Hell when our army captures the middle three heavens of the Immortal Realm!" One Palace Master spoke, his voice carrying an unyielding tone.

Two years...

Luo Tian's thoughts deepened further. Not only was the time insufficient, but Luoshengmen's strength was also immeasurable. Even if Tianyuan Sect fought with Luoshengmen directly, it would not necessarily be a match. Moreover, Luoshengmen was mysterious and elusive in its movements.

"This is like boiling a frog slowly, just like the Nine Immortal Mountains once made Tianyuan Sect defend Hell!" Luo Tian's anger surged, feeling utterly humiliated.

"Two years? That's about right!" Luo Tian muttered internally, forcing himself to suppress his anger.

Luo Tian had no choice but to restrain his anger because if he exploded, the Ten Palaces would have a reason to attack Tianyuan Sect immediately.

"This is natural; the Tianyuan Sect joining Hell must contribute to Hell's efforts!" Luo Tian raised his head, smiling.

"Additionally, our Ten Palaces' disciples must not be harmed by your Tianyuan Sect. Do you understand?" Another Palace Master spoke.

"If they don't provoke us, we won't provoke them!" Luo Tian replied, as if pushed to his limit.

"Let's talk about that later," Ye Fengdu shook his head gently. Hell's current strength was also thin; the attack on the Immortal Realm had cost much, and now Tianyuan Sect was a good supplement.

From start to finish, Hei Bai Chang and Bai Lian remained silent, as did Tianyu Laogui. They spoke a lot of unequal conditions before allowing Luo Tian to leave.

A surge of energy spread; Hei Bai Chang and Luo Tian appeared in Luo Tian's courtyard. Upon arrival, Chen Zhanbiao and the others rushed to his side.

Luo Tian clenched his fists, blood flowing from them; his body trembled violently, and his breath was heavy.

"Senior Brother, what's wrong?" Chen Zhanbiao saw Luo Tian's condition and immediately asked.

Hearing Chen Zhanbiao's words, Luo Tian slowly raised his head, and a smile appeared on his face—though this smile felt chilling.

"Nothing's wrong; after my injuries, we'll go home!" Luo Tian spoke softly.

Chapter 2624: Dealing with Luoshengmen

Luo Tian had his own plans. Two years was neither long nor short; the Ten Palaces had determined he would accept because of his strength.

During these two years, Luo Tian might attempt to enter the late stage of Immortal King. He was confident that if he reached the late stage, he might be able to fight a peak Immortal King. However, there was an 80% chance he would lose.

His greatest secret was the Snake Emperor in Bujiao Mountain, Medusa, a semi-Immortal King. Calculating the time, Medusa should have already awakened.

A semi-Immortal King—once she appeared, the Ten Palaces' peak Immortal Kings would have to unite for a chance of victory.

However, Luo Tian's current identity entering the upper three heavens would certainly be hunted by the Nine Immortal Mountains, making it difficult. Therefore, Luo Tian wanted to wait until he reached the late stage of Immortal King before entering the upper three heavens and then returning to Bujiao Mountain once more.

"Immortal Realm, Hell—there is no place for the Tianyuan Sect to exist!" Luo Tian sighed and sat down.

"Zhanbiao, go back to the Tianyuan Sect and give this jade slip to Sichou!" Luo Tian sent a mental message to Chen Zhanbiao, handing him a jade slip. The slip recorded Luo Tian's thoughts and must be known by everyone quickly.

Luo Tian's injuries would take many days to recover, and he could not delay too long. Moreover, Luo Tian truly needed to find Luoshengmen because Qiu Qiu was still in Luoshengmen. He wanted to retrieve her, whether by force or deception.

"Senior Brother, I can't leave; what about your safety?" Chen Zhanbiao shook his head immediately, unwilling to depart.

"Obey me; I'm fine here!" Luo Tian saw Chen Zhanbiao's expression, feeling warm but also appreciating how much Chen Zhanbiao had grown.

"Yes, Brother Zhanbiao, the two of us can protect Senior Brother!" Da Niu spoke, his voice resolute.

"I don't trust the two of you..." Chen Zhanbiao looked at Da Niu and Er Niu, muttering. However, even his mutterings were louder than ordinary people's.

"Brother Zhanbiao, are you doubting us?" Hearing Chen Zhanbiao's mutterings, Da Niu and Er Niu were displeased, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao.

Though they had known each other for a short time, their personalities were very similar, so they quickly became good friends. Being doubted by Chen Zhanbiao made Da Niu and Er Niu unwilling to accept it.
