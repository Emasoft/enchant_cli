A low hum resonated as Ke Xinsui's hands formed seals, his entire body standing within the Zhuque Ancestral Flame. As he executed the hand gesture, the phoenix-shaped illusion shuddered violently, and countless red swords resembling feathers erupted forth.

A rain of swords filled the sky, an attack without distinction. The countless swords scattered within the barrier, their primary target being Luo Tian.

"Heavenly-grade swords! How many of these Heaven-grade swords are there? The Zhuque Sect truly has deep pockets!" The surrounding people displayed envy on their faces, gazing at each sword continuously emerging from the Zhuque Ancestral Flame.

"Truly affluent!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows. Each of these swords could injure him, though not fatally; but once the first one made contact, the second would strike.

"This is quite troublesome!" Luo Tian extended his hand, and numerous emerald-green fire dragons surged forth from it, forming a barrier before him.

The fire dragons clashed with the flying swords, and each sword plummeted rapidly upon contact with the emerald-green fire dragons, as if losing their vitality.

"Ten... a thousand... ten thousand..." After a total of ten thousand swords had fallen to the ground, the flying swords in the sky vanished entirely.

As the flying swords disappeared, a scent of fire permeated the entire sky, filled with red and green embers.

"Kill!" Seeing that his efforts could not eliminate Luo Tian, Ke Xinsui roared, having no other choice but to clash with Luo Tian directly.

"It's my turn!" Luo Tian remained stationary, his palm slightly extended, a smile on his face as he gently pressed downward into the void.

"Boom..." A furious flame erupted instantly under Luo Tian's press, not only the Jade Crystal Lustrous Flame but even Ke Xinsui's Zhuque Ancestral Flame was ignited by Luo Tian.

The two ancestral flames seemed to react mysteriously, the fire sea turning a pale purple.

Luo Tian's control over speed was impeccable; it was only when Ke Xinsui charged toward him, reaching the densest point of fire embers that he activated the Fentian Lihuo Array (Blazing Heaven Fire Formation).

Then Ke Xinsui met his demise; the temperature from the fusion of the two flames scorched through the void, and even the barrier developed countless fine cracks under this terrifying heat.

Luo Tian stood outside the flames, sweat constantly forming on his face, yet it was instantly evaporated by the terrifying heat.

"Elder Brother!" Ke Xinxie's face showed anxiety as she roared into the barrier, transforming into a streak of red light and charging recklessly toward the sealing platform's barrier.

Before Ke Xinxie could collide with the barrier, a low growl echoed in her ears: "Return!"

The flames faded, revealing a charred figure in people's sight, causing their faces to display shock.

"He didn’t fall even after that?" People marveled at Ke Xinsui's strength upon seeing the charred figure standing.

"Pound..." But in the next moment, the charred figure slowly collapsed onto the sealing platform, leaving only a faint breath.

"Boom..." The crowd erupted in a commotion, their gazes turning to Luo Tian standing there, though disheveled, with a confident smile.

"Victory!" The disciples of the Qinglong Sect roared loudly, shouting Luo Tian's name.

Luo Tian had defeated Ke Xinsui, solidifying the first and second places in the strength competition as the overall ranking champion.

Sha Cangmang's gaze was filled with complexity; his aged fist clenched tightly. Luo Tian was exceptionally outstanding, even surpassing Jiang Sxi in Sha Cangmang's view.

"Hum..." The long spear trembled slightly, the jet-black Rupture Heaven Spear gleaming with a cold light, its tip pointing at Ke Xinsui's charred body.

"Blades and swords know no mercy!" Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Ke Xinxie outside the crumbling barrier.

"Don't harm my elder brother! Please don't harm my elder brother! If you dare injure her, I swear with my life to destroy you!" Seeing Luo Tian's spear tip aimed at Ke Xinsui, Ke Xinxie raged into a frenzy, shouting wildly.

"You're just talking nonsense. Don't blame me for actually killing your brother!" Luo Tian's face was cold; he waved his hand, and vitality spread, flowing into Ke Xinsui's body.

After receiving Luo Tian's wood-element energy, Ke Xinsui slowly opened his eyes, though they were somewhat lifeless. His gaze turned to Luo Tian as he gradually stood up, taking a step at a time toward Ke Xinxie.

"Thank you!" Ke Xinsui whispered, her voice carrying helplessness and exhaustion.

"Go on!" After speaking to Luo Tian, Ke Xinsui spoke softly to Ke Xinxie, and with her support, she walked toward the Zhuque Sect's gathering place.

Ke Xinxie gazed deeply at Luo Tian, her eyes revealing complexity. No one knew what she was thinking; after returning to the Zhuque Sect's gathering place, she said nothing but continuously channeled her wood-element essence into Ke Xinsui's body.

"Will the two of you fight again?" The Grand Master looked at Luo Tian and Jiang Sxi, awaiting their response.

As the Grand Master's words faded, people stirred, their gazes filled with curiosity toward Luo Tian and Jiang Sxi.

Now only the final battle remains, an internal conflict of the Qinglong Sect. No matter who among Luo Tian and Jiang Sxi wins first place, the Qinglong Sect's top position is secured. The Qinglong Sect has already become the greatest winner; their match holds no necessity.

Yet, people still wished to know whether Luo Tian the dark horse was stronger or Jiang Sxi the veteran genius. Even the Qinglong Sect's disciples displayed a hint of curiosity.

"Hum..." Jiang Sxi pushed off the ground, leaping onto the arena, her gaze filled with fierce battle intent toward Luo Tian.

"This woman!" Luo Tian sighed, watching Jiang Sxi's aura steadily rising on the sealing platform, then leaped onto the arena.

"We're both on the same side; is there still a need to fight?" Luo Tian spoke, his voice carrying helplessness.

"Who considers you one of us? Since the moment you had the Sect Leader bind the Binding God's Belt to my head, we've been enemies! When have I ever suffered such humiliation!" Jiang Sxi spoke softly, her gaze filled with endless anger.

"Hua..." Though Jiang Sxi's voice was soft, it was overheard by those who listened closely, causing a commotion among the people.

"What? Did I hear correctly? Jiang Sxi, how could she be Luo Tian's subordinate!" People marveled at Luo Tian, pondering his true origin, how he could have Jiang Sxi as a subordinate.

Soon, it spread from one to ten, then a hundred; the topic of Jiang Sxi being Luo Tian's subordinate ignited among the crowd, making people regard Luo Tian with even greater reverence.

"What luck this boy has! Having Jiang Sxi as a subordinate! Hmph, he can do whatever he wants!" Among the crowd, someone remarked, their gaze filled with envy toward Luo Tian.

"Begin!" The Grand Master, also displaying a hint of curiosity, announced the start of their match.

"Hum..." Before the Grand Master's words had finished, Jiang Sxi's feet emitted a thunderous sound; her body instantly appeared, five source powers with immense fluctuations attacking Luo Tian.

"The Path of Time, the Path of Space, the Path of Darkness..." Sensing Jiang Sxi's source power, Luo Tian nodded in approval within his heart, remaining still with a smile on his face.

"I surrender!" Luo Tian crossed his arms, and his voice echoed in the people's ears.

"What? He surrendered already? How timid!" People displayed confusion, having expected another thrilling match but instead witnessing this conclusion.

"Crack..." Jiang Sxi's figure halted before Luo Tian, her eyes filled with anger. The ground beneath her feet cracked repeatedly; the five source powers abruptly ceased, unleashing a fierce wind that blew against Luo Tian's face.

"What do you mean?" Jiang Sxi gazed coldly at Luo Tian.

"There’s no meaning. What could there be? Fighting between us holds no significance; it's unnecessary to do so in front of so many people!" Ignoring Jiang Sxi's furious anger, Luo Tian turned and walked down from the sealing platform.

"Ah, by the way, since you've returned, come help me tidy my room tonight. Your absence has left it quite messy!" As Luo Tian leaped down from the sealing platform, he turned and addressed Jiang Sxi, who stood on it with an expression of extreme displeasure.

"Luo... Tian!" Jiang Sxi gritted her teeth, desperately wanting to kick him in the face and stomp on him repeatedly.

But Jiang Sxi knew, aside from the Binding God's Belt, even Sha Cangmang could not move Luo Tian.

"What? He made Jiang Sxi tidy his room! He truly treated her as a subordinate!" People displayed disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian with deep reverence. Who in the entire Four Sacred Stars could have such treatment?

"Well, I declare Jiang Sxi the first place in the strength competition!" The Grand Master, with a look of helplessness, quickly announced the match's result.

Though the result was no longer significant for Qinglong Sect disciples, upon hearing Jiang Sxi's first place, they still cheered loudly.

Though Jiang Sxi was first, this ranking battle added Luo Tian to the hearts of people across the Four Sacred Star Regions, even making him more renowned than Jiang Sxi.

In the Dan Dao competition, he alone won first place, slaying Yang Feiyang and Yang Dingtian brothers, defeating Ke Xinsui, even having Jiang Sxi as his subordinate.

At this point, Luo Tian added an air of mystery to people's minds; they wished to know his true identity. Being merely a disciple of the Qinglong Sect's Grand Master seemed insufficient.

Jiang Sxi, however, showed no joy on her face; her expression was ashen as she approached Luo Tian below the sealing platform.

Time slowly passed; the one hour slipped by amidst people's discussions. The head elder also stepped onto the sealing platform again, announcing this ranking battle's results.

As expected, the Qinglong Sect took first place, Zhuque Sect second. Though Baihu Sect lost two disciples, it remained third; Xuanwu Sect maintained its usual fourth place.

The Baihu Sect disciples were exasperated to the point of vomiting. Previously, they had been second place, even with a chance to challenge first; this year, however, they only secured third, nearly slipping to fourth.

As for the sixth to tenth places, they were occupied by other sects. However, people weren’t particularly concerned; after all, with the four major sects in place, the remaining sects received only what was left after the four major ones had taken their share.

"Luo Tian! You have a chance to go to Xuanwu Sect!" Chen Leye smiled as he approached the Qinglong Sect, addressing Luo Tian.

"I'll definitely go if the chance arises!" Luo Tian greatly respected Xuanwu Sect, but its conduct was quite unsuitable for him.

In Luo Tian's view, if there's a grudge, one must retaliate. If you strike me once, I'll return the favor. Living in a suppressed manner is too meaningless. Given Xuanwu Sect's style, becoming one of the Four Sacred Star major sects after such a long tradition is already a miracle in this ruthless cultivation world.

"By the way, Luo Tian, be merciful where you can. Cultivation is arduous; though I know your response may not be what I wish, I still must advise you!"

Upon hearing Chen Leye's words, Luo Tian sighed in frustration. Originally intending to visit Xuanwu Sect, he temporarily set aside the idea; he didn’t want to be lectured by a crowd of disciples upon entering.

"Let's go!" Sha Cangmang smiled as he arrived at the Qinglong Sect disciples' gathering place, clearly satisfied with the resource allocation discussed earlier.

Jin Yongsie, Chen Xuanning, and Ke Zhen Tian also returned to their respective sects, leading their disciples away.

As the four major sects departed, other sects also left in succession. The four major sects left four Seven-Source Heaven Zun to guard the Sealing Continent.

Under Sha Cangmang's leadership, Luo Tian and other Qinglong Sect disciples appeared outside the Sealing Continent, their faces filled with admiration as they gazed at it.

As numerous sects departed, the entire Sealing Continent seemed to activate a vast formation, concealing it entirely and sealing off the whole continent.

"This Sealing Continent seems far from simple on the surface!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, gazing at the Sealing Continent obscured by the formation. He felt an unfamiliar yet familiar presence on it, touching his heart.

"I'll check it out when I'm stronger!" Luo Tian muttered quietly, following Sha Cangmang's back under the Qinglong Sect disciples' respectful gazes as they flew back to the Qinglong Sect.

The group returned to the Qinglong Sect, where it erupted into celebration. The news of Qinglong Sect's first place in the ranking battle spread throughout the sect. Luo Tian’s performance in the ranking battle was again widely discussed, making his name the most talked-about topic of the day, surpassing even Jiang Sxi's reputation.

The Qinglong Sect celebrated for three days. Some disciples went out to guard the entire Four Sacred Stars, and the newly allocated lands were reassigned. The Qinglong Sect once again became orderly.

...

East Ping Continent, a small continent under Qinglong Sect's jurisdiction. The entire continent had barely ten million people; cultivators' strength was weak, with the highest attainment merely at the Soul-Consolidation Peak. It lagged far behind Tianyuan Continent.

At this moment, a young woman soared through the air over East Ping Continent, her face displaying anger. The golden headband fluttered in the wind, giving her an ethereal appearance.

However, a young man behind the woman ruined this beautiful scene. He also wore a golden headband and smiled, standing before her as if he were the master.

This man and woman were Luo Tian and Jiang Sxi. Since Jiang Sxi had won first place in the strength competition, Qinglong Sect awarded her this East Ping Continent.

Jiang Sxi was initially quite happy to possess her own continent; after all, it meant she no longer had to roam the world seeking resources and could focus on studying elixir formulas.

But everything changed because of one person—Luo Tian, this annoying fellow. Jiang Sxi felt as if she had dug up his family's ancestral grave in a past life, and now he was haunting her.

As soon as she joyfully left the Qinglong Continent, Luo Tian followed with his face upturned, claiming she was his subordinate and that her continent naturally belonged to him.

"Ah, this continent is so beautiful!" Luo Tian spoke boldly, gazing at the endless mountains and rivers.

Jiang Sxi gritted her teeth, desperately wanting to slap Luo Tian into death. However, the Binding God's Belt on her head was a chain, forcing her to suppress that thought.

The two flew swiftly, arriving at a mountain peak—the Qinglong Sect disciples' garrison. They didn’t stop and directly flew into the grand hall atop the mountain.

The Qinglong Sect disciples had already waited in the grand hall, their faces showing reverence. Upon seeing Jiang Sxi and Luo Tian arrive, they were slightly surprised, especially noting both wore golden headbands.

East Ping Continent was a relatively small continent; the Qinglong Sect disciples stationed here were only at the Soul-Consolidation stage. Information was scarce; while Jiang Sxi’s group were known, Luo Tian was less familiar.

"Jiang Sect Leader!" Though the disciples were puzzled as to why Jiang Sxi wore the Binding God's Belt, they still respectfully bowed to her.

"Alright, alright! You might not know me yet. I'm Luo Tian, the master of your master. From now on, in this East Ping Continent, I'm the top; Jiang Sxi is second. Got it!" Luo Tian casually sat on the main seat, addressing the disciples and attendants who bowed respectfully below him.

"This? Luo Tian? Who is Luo Tian?"

"Never heard of him!" The disciples and attendants below were puzzled, their gazes turning to Jiang Sxi.

"Hmph..." Seeing Luo Tian's casual demeanor, Jiang Sxi couldn’t bear to look at him for a moment. She let out a cold snort and immediately teleported to the courtyard prepared by the disciples.

Seeing Jiang Sxi leave, the disciples and attendants became even more puzzled. Their gazes turned to Luo Tian’s casual demeanor, unable to fathom his relationship with Jiang Sxi.

"Hurry up and prepare a place for me—big, good, luxurious!" Luo Tian commanded the disciples and attendants.

The disciples, seeing Luo Tian’s attitude, were annoyed but dared not offend him before confirming his true identity. They followed his orders to prepare accordingly.

Luo Tian nodded in satisfaction, scanning the attendants with a subtle shake of his head.

"Too weak. Such strength can't be my底气 to return to Tianyuan Continent!" Luo Tian’s eyes flickered, and he secretly decided to slightly elevate their strength.

Chapter 775: Consuming the Dutianyang Divine Pill

East Ping Continent, Luo Tian sat in a luxurious room, holding a pill resembling a luminous pearl—Dutianyang Divine Pill, which he had crafted during the Dan Dao competition in the ranking battle.

Dutianyang Divine Pill—others were unaware, but Luo Tian and Jiang Sxi knew its astonishing power.

Because the pill’s effect allowed the user to potentially cultivate a source path of light.

Though light attribute wasn’t part of the great Dao, it was a special one; ordinary people found it hard to cultivate.

"To eat or not to eat? If I do, I’ll have a chance to enter the Five-Source Immortal. But if I reach that level, the 'fate' Sha Cangmang mentioned will put me in danger!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, muttering softly.

After pondering, Luo Tian’s face showed a determined expression. "In the end, I must confront it; I can't stay at Four-Source or Five-Source Immortal forever. Come on, let’s see what Sha Cangmang’s scheme is!"

After thinking, Luo Tian placed the Dutianyang Divine Pill into his mouth. A warm sensation made him hum slightly, and he closed his eyes to refine the pill and cultivate it.

At the same time, Jiang Sxi also took out the Dutianyang Divine Pill, her face showing admiration. She placed it into her mouth and closed her eyes to cultivate it.

...

The entire East Ping Continent, this small continent, fell into silence as Luo Tian and Jiang Sxi entered seclusion.

Jiang Sxi and Luo Tian both entered seclusion. At this time, the person in charge of East Ping Continent was a Qinglong Sect disciple named Ding Hetong at the Boundary-Respect stage.

Before Jiang Sxi and Luo Tian arrived, Ding Hetong had managed East Ping Continent. Now their arrival made him quite upset, shifting from his previous imperial life to a ministerial role, requiring diligence.

Ding Hetong naturally knew Jiang Sxi’s name—Qinglong Sect’s first genius. As for Luo Tian, he wasn’t familiar with him, but seeing Jiang Sxi’s attitude toward Luo Tian, he guessed Luo Tian wasn’t simple.

"Senior Brother Ding!" Three figures with sycophantic smiles appeared before Ding Hetong.

Feeling Ding Hetong’s displeasure, a disciple with sly eyes at the Soul-Consolidation Peak stage addressed him: "Why are you so unhappy, Senior Brother Ding?"

"You know why!" Ding Hetong coldly snorted. The three had been his subordinates, not outsiders; they naturally knew his troubles.

"Senior Brother Ding, do you want to permanently possess this East Ping Continent?" Another disciple glanced around and smiled at Ding Hetong.

Hearing the implied meaning in their words, Ding Hetong’s brows furrowed slightly. He spoke softly: "What do you mean?"

"Senior Brother Ding must know that the current East Ping Continent’s master is now Jiang Sxi. The only way for you to become its master is to make Jiang Sxi take your surname!" One disciple spoke, gazing at Ding Hetong.

Hearing the disciple’s words, Ding Hetong’s eyes flickered with light. He scanned the three disciples, understanding their meaning well. But thinking of his own status as a mere Boundary-Respect and Jiang Sxi’s lofty position, how could she look at him Ding Hetong?

"Senior Brother Ding, look at this!" The disciple who had spoken first waved his hand, revealing a powder-like substance emitting a faint fragrance that stirred Ding Hetong’s mind.

"This is the Immortal-Grade Dispersing Powder!" Ding Hetong spoke, his eyes glowing with light as he gazed at the three.

"Senior Brother Ding has seduced countless women; the rest need no teaching. When it’s done, don’t forget to let us three brothers taste this Qinglong Sect first genius!" The three smiled slyly, gazing at Ding Hetong.

Ding Hetong’s gaze flickered, his face showing contemplation. He bit his teeth: "Let’s do it! At worst, I’ll die! From now on, I’ll be the true master of East Ping Continent! And Jiang Sxi, this woman—enough!"

"But the boy accompanying Jiang Sxi is quite tough! He’s no good guy. This matter needs careful planning!" Ding Hetong and the three discussed quietly, sometimes serious, sometimes with cruel expressions.

However, Luo Tian and Jiang Sxi continuously refined the volatile power of the Dutianyang Divine Pill, having no time to care about East Ping Continent’s affairs.

Time slowly passed; Luo Tian and Jiang Sxi remained in seclusion for seven days, no signs of activity, as if they had never come to East Ping Continent.

"Are you ready?" Ding Hetong smiled, addressing the three with a hint of excitement and tension in his gaze, waiting for Luo Tian and Jiang Sxi to emerge from seclusion.

Under the four’s expectant gazes, Jiang Sxi finally reacted. Her courtyard glowed with golden light; she ascended into the sky like a fairy, merging with the sun and vanishing from people’s sight.

At the same time, the world’s energy slowly flowed toward Jiang Sxi, making Qinglong Sect disciples on the mountain peak display excitement and reverence.

"Jiang Sxi has advanced! What level will she be after this upgrade?" Disciples and attendants discussed, especially those at the Soul-Consolidation Peak stage couldn’t discern Jiang Sxi’s level.

The roaring sounds continued, lasting an entire hour before the sky’s intense light faded.

The pink long dress fluttered in the wind; Jiang Sxi’s figure appeared in people’s sight, like a spirit of the world. At this moment, her aura was even more ethereal.

"Six-Source Heaven Immortal!" Jiang Sxi’s eyes showed satisfaction. From today on, she had entered the Heaven Immortal ranks, able to harness the world’s power for battle, her strength having made a qualitative leap.

"Congratulations on your promotion, Senior Sister!" Ding Hetong’s voice rang out, drawing Jiang Sxi’s attention to his presence.

Her eyes showed contemplation, thinking of who Ding Hetong was. She lightly landed before him and the others.

"What happened during my seclusion?" Jiang Sxi spoke softly, not glancing at Ding Hetong. If she had, she would have noticed his eyes’ intense lustful gaze.

Ding Hetong’s face showed greed, gazing at Jiang Sxi’s flawless face. His heart cried: "I must have her!"

"Nothing serious. Recently, a disciple offered a flower called 'No Trace'—extremely beautiful. Hearing that Senior Sister Jiang likes flowers, I specially had it sent."

"Oh?" Jiang Sxi’s eyes showed interest. Though she was Qinglong Sect’s first genius, she was still a woman and naturally interested in flowers; she loved cultivating them.

"No Trace Flower" — Jiang Sxi had never heard of this name before. Naturally, she wanted to see it. She spoke softly: "Bring it out! You’ve thought of this."

Hearing Jiang Sxi’s words, Ding Hetong dared not delay. He waved his hand and took out the No Trace Flower from his storage bag.

As soon as the No Trace Flower was taken out, Jiang Sxi’s eyes couldn’t look away. She had seen countless flowers before, but this No Trace Flower ranked third among those she had cultivated.

"Good. Take this bottle of pills; it should allow you to reach the Half-Immortal stage!" Jiang Sxi took the No Trace Flower, gave Ding Hetong a bottle of pills, then slowly walked toward her residence.

"It’s done!" Seeing Jiang Sxi taking the No Trace Flower with great care, Ding Hetong and the three’s faces showed joy.

Suppressing his excitement, Ding Hetong arranged daily affairs as if nothing had happened, gazing at Luo Tian’s courtyard.

"This kid hasn’t emerged from seclusion yet! Perhaps heaven wants me to succeed! Once he emerges, the rice will be cooked!" Ding Hetong smiled, waiting for nightfall.

Time slowly passed. Under the four’s expectant gazes, the black night finally arrived. Following their agreement, they left their homes and headed toward Jiang Sxi’s residence.

...

At this moment, Jiang Sxi’s face was grim. She hadn’t expected that after just upgrading to Six-Source Heaven Immortal, her body’s energy seemed sealed, showing no signs of flow. Even the great Dao source in her dantian was immobile.

"Could it be the aftereffect of merging with my clone too early?" Jiang Sxi lightly fiddled with the white No Trace Flower, her face showing contemplation. Even now, she hadn’t thought Ding Hetong would dare to harm her.

But Jiang Sxi felt an inexplicable fear. She now seemed like an ordinary person; she had never felt this way in years, especially the night—Jiang Sxi feared it for the first time.

"Senior Sister Jiang! Asleep?" Ding Hetong’s voice rang out, his face smiling. He didn’t even knock and stepped into Jiang Sxi’s room.

"Hm?" Jiang Sxi saw Ding Hetong and the four behind him. Her brows furrowed slightly, sensing something was wrong.

"What are you doing here?" Jiang Sxi spoke coldly. Though her cultivation was gone, her dominant attitude remained.

"F*** you!" Ding Hetong gently closed the door, his face showing excitement. He couldn’t control himself and roared, lunging at Jiang Sxi.

"Hehe!" The three who came with Ding Hetong smiled lewdly, watching him rush at Jiang Sxi.

Chapter 776: Pill’s Power
