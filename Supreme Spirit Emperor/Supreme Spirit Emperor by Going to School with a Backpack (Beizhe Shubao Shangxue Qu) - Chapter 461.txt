“Young Master, you're amazing!” Long Zaitian raised his hand and gave Luo Tian a thumbs-up. However, he shook his head: “I just heard about it. Above the Immortal King is supposedly the Immortal Emperor!”

“But these are just legends. Legends aren’t trustworthy. I heard that the founder of the Gui Gu Mountain, Gui Guzi, ascended to the throne and broke through into the realm of immortality!” Long Zaitian’s face showed a hint of longing, leaving Luo Tian unsure whether he was fabricating or if there truly were such legends.

“Then what are the trials in Tianlong City?” Luo Tian asked again, this time with a more reasonable question.

“Trials…”

“You’ve asked the right person, Young Master. This time’s trials are unusually strange, so the rules have changed!” Long Zaitian’s face lit up with excitement upon hearing Luo Tian’s question, as if he had heard some news.

“This time it's not just the Tianlong Sect’s trials. The thousand-year War for Heaven is about to begin, and the Tianlong Sect is recruiting disciples not just for selection but also to prepare for the War for Heaven. The other two sects certainly wouldn’t agree, as only one sect can participate in the War for Heaven!”

“Therefore, the Didi Sect and Tie Sect have also come to recruit disciples. So this time, Young Master isn’t just eligible for the Tianlong Sect but also has a chance to join the Didi Sect!” Long Zaitian continued speaking.

“Of course, since it's for the War for Heaven, the number of recruits should be large, but the difficulty will be the hardest!” Long Zaitian’s eyes gleamed with excitement. He paused, then downed the remaining wine in his cup.

“How difficult is it?” Luo Tian frowned slightly upon hearing Long Zaitian’s words. He had already clashed with Wan Youlan and Du Changtian, whose strength he considered unremarkable.

“This time, it's not just the geniuses from the lower three cities but also geniuses from other sects!” Long Zaitian’s face radiated a fierce light.

“Other sects?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, puzzled as to why the three sects would arrange this.

“This is a last-ditch effort by the three major sects. If they fail in the War for Heaven, they’ll descend into obscurity; if successful and gain entry to the middle three realms, disciples from other sects within the three major sects will also follow them into the middle three realms. Naturally, they’ll maintain connections with their original sects!”

“Meanwhile, disciples from smaller sects also have a chance to advance. Entering the middle three realms will surely enhance their strength significantly—this is a win-win situation. Other sects’ disciples rely on one of the three major sects to enter the middle three realms, while the sects that gain War for Heaven qualifications strengthen their power through these disciples and break into the middle three realms!” Long Zaitian spoke, then began eating from the table.

“I wonder if my old friend has come to participate in the sect trials,” Luo Tian murmured quietly, his gaze filled with anticipation.

“Do you know who the notable geniuses are?” Luo Tian asked again, ignoring Long Zaitian’s hearty eating.

“I only know about the geniuses from the cities. Ten major cities have people here; as for the smaller cities, there are too many to mention!” Long Zaitian shook his head lightly and carefully pulled out a small booklet from his sleeve, flipping through it.

“The first is Ding Tianqing from Didi City. He has the early stage of the Immortal Soul and once killed a bandit leader in Didi City, earning fame!”

“Then there’s Chen Tieshan from the Tie Sect. His body is terrifying; he once tore apart a beast of the early Immortal Soul stage!”

“However, these two are likely just going through the motions. Everyone knows that behind the two cities are the shadows of two major sects, and their entry into Didi Sect and Tie Sect is practically guaranteed!” Long Zaitian continued.

“The third one to mention is Wan Youlan. She has the rare furnace body, and her strength is formidable. Many people have been eyeing her. These days, many geniuses have approached Wan Youlan to become her Dao companion!”

“Ah, speaking of Wan Youlan, there’s a young man named Luo Tian. A few days ago, Wan Youlan arrived in Tianlong City and fought with this Luo Tian outside the city. In the end, Luo Tian defeated both Wan Youlan and Du Changtian almost to death!” Long Zaitian’s face showed admiration.

“This Luo Tian was previously unknown, but he appeared so powerfully. I heard that the battle was chaotic… even the Tianlong City Lord was disturbed…” Long Zaitian spoke endlessly, recounting different versions of Luo Tian and Wan Youlan’s conflict outside the city.

“Words can be terrifying,” Luo Tian said with a sigh, his gaze filled with a bitter smile. He hadn’t expected to be so legendary.

“Still, this Luo Tian is mysterious; he hasn’t shown his face in Tianlong City for so many days. Those who wanted to become Wan Youlan’s Dao companion are searching for this Luo Tian, hoping to teach him a lesson and win Wan Youlan’s favor!” Long Zaitian didn’t notice Luo Tian’s darkened expression and continued speaking.

“As for the others, aside from the sects’ geniuses, in my opinion, none are as strong as these few!”

“No, there’s another one. Gu Qiansnow from Luoxue City. She is the adopted daughter of the Luoxue City Lord. Though she’s an adopted daughter, she is deeply loved by the city lord. Among these geniuses, besides Wan Youlan, Gu Qiansnow has the greatest fame. And I’ve heard that her beauty surpasses even Wan Youlan’s!” Long Zaitian said with admiration, completely unaware of Luo Tian’s trembling body.

“Qiansnow!” Luo Tian's heart pounded violently, his body shaking fiercely. His hands clenched tightly, his fingertips turning white.

“Young Master, what’s wrong?” Long Zaitian was about to speak but noticed Luo Tian's abnormal state. His gaze held confusion.

“Luo Tian, do you know this Gu Qiansnow?” Long Youlan also looked puzzled.

“Crack… crack…” The next moment, Luo Tian grabbed Long Zaitian’s shoulder: “Where is she staying now!”

“Y-Young Master… don’t get excited, let go of me first… she’s currently in Tianlong City at Luoxue Inn…” Long Zaitian felt his shoulder about to be crushed, sweat pouring down his face from the pain.

“Luoxue Inn! Take me there!” Luo Tian stood up, his gaze filled with excitement. His eyes were slightly moist.

Chapter 1788: News of Gu Qiansnow

“Young Master, go ahead, but don’t you first let me go…” Luo Tian suddenly stood up, but his hand still clutched Long Zaitian. Long Zaitian’s trembling voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears, bringing him back to a sliver of sanity.

“Who is Gu Qiansnow?” Long Youlan looked at Luo Tian’s excited demeanor. Having known Luo Tian for a while, she had never seen him so out of control before. Curiosity stirred within her about this Gu Qiansnow.

“Sorry!” Luo Tian gently released Long Zaitian, his face showing gratitude. Regardless of whether the other information was true or false, this single piece of news about Gu Qiansnow was enough to make Luo Tian grateful to Long Zaitian.

“Is it my Qiansnow?” Regaining his composure, Luo Tian thought to himself. After all, there are many people with the same name; even in the Nine Realms, there aren’t just one Gu Qiansnow. There are countless people named Luo Tian as well.

“Regardless, I need to see for myself!” Luo Tian murmured quietly. His instinct told him that the Gu Qiansnow Long Zaitian mentioned was his wife.

“Huh…” Long Zaitian sighed deeply. The feeling Luo Tian had given him was terrifying, as if he were a primordial beast ready to swallow him whole.

While the three of them spoke, several people entered the restaurant. Their faces were cold; they didn’t look for seats but instead surveyed the room. Upon seeing Luo Tian and his companions, they approached.

“Hey, Young Master, Luoxue Inn is famous in Tianlong City. You can go yourself. Thank you for your hospitality; I’ll take my leave now. Since we have a connection, I’m giving you this Tianlong News Record!” Long Zaitian saw the people and his face slightly changed. He handed Luo Tian the booklet he had just taken out, then hurried towards the back door of the restaurant.

“Long Zaitian, where are you running?” Seeing Long Zaitian heading for the restaurant’s exit, the men quickened their pace and shouted.

But Long Zaitian seemed not to hear. He sped up, rushing out the back door.

“Haha, kid, you can’t run away today!” As Long Zaitian was about to exit the back door, a big foot suddenly extended from it and kicked him in the chest.

“Peng…” A dull sound echoed. Long Zaitian’s body flew back, colliding with several tables. Several diners also stood up in anger, glaring at the people who had entered from the back door.

The leader was a young man with a lecherous expression, thin and gaunt. His eyes lacked luster, as if his body had been drained by wine and women. The most noticeable feature was his twisted mouth, which twitched constantly.

Most of the guests, although angry, sat back down. Some even paid and left immediately.

Wang Quandan, the tyrant of Tianlong City. His father was a steward in the Tianlong City Lord’s mansion. Few dared to provoke Wang Quandan in Tianlong City, even the young geniuses who had recently entered. After all, a strong dragon can’t suppress a local snake.

“Wang公子, it’s such a coincidence. You’re also here for dinner!” Long Zaitian got up awkwardly, wiping the blood from his lips. His chest bore a clear footprint, but he smiled and addressed Wang Quandan.

“Feilong Zaitian?” Wang Quandan saw the people’s fear and felt a surge of satisfaction. He grabbed Long Zaitian by the collar, addressing him: “Long Zaitian, you’re not Feilong Zaitian? You still have time to eat here? And you even have money for food. Why don’t you pay me back?” Wang Quandan smiled menacingly.

“Ah, Wang公子, I can’t not eat. After all, people are iron and food is steel; one meal without it makes you hungry!” Long Zaitian smiled sycophantically, his eyes flashing a hint of bitterness.

“Don’t talk nonsense. You’re at the half-Immortal Soul stage; do you need to eat? Even if you don’t eat for a month, you won’t starve!” Wang Quandan heard Long Zaitian’s words and kicked him again without hesitation. Long Zaitian's body flew back once more.

“Waiter! Pay the bill!” Luo Tian gently closed Long Zaitian’s booklet and smiled at the waiter.

“Sure thing…” The restaurant waiter, clearly experienced, hurried to Luo Tian’s side with a trademark smile.

“Sir, it's two Immortal Stones!” The waiter smiled and handed the bill to Luo Tian.

“Huh?” Hearing the waiter’s words, Luo Tian furrowed his brow. Before eating, he had only ordered one Immortal Stone’s worth of food. Now the waiter was asking for two.

“Black shop! You were one Immortal Stone before, now you’re asking for two. Do you think our Immortal Stones are blown in by the wind?” Long Youlan immediately protested, hands on her hips.

“Sir, don’t talk nonsense. Our restaurant has been around for decades in Tianlong City; we never cheat!” The waiter’s face turned serious, his gaze on Luo Tian.

“Your friend just ordered a table alone and spent one Immortal Stone. He said he wanted to talk to you, so the bill is on your account! If you’re not his friend, go ask him!” The waiter pointed at Long Zaitian, who had just been grabbed by Wang Quandan.

“Long Zaitian, if you don’t pay back the money today, I won’t be polite. First, I’ll break your arm!” Wang Quandan’s face showed a sinister expression as he waved his green sword, gazing at Long Zaitian.

“Wang公子, let’s talk it out. I promise to pay you back in a month!” Long Zaitian looked at the glinting sword and pleaded, sweat pouring from his forehead.

“A month? You’ve been delaying for half a year already. Do you know how much money you owe me now? Seventy-eight Immortal Stones! You think you can pay it back? You’ll never leave our Wang family again. Go clean the toilets for me!” Wang Quandan sneered.

“Support him!” After speaking, Wang Quandan pushed Long Zaitian towards his men. Two strongmen grabbed Long Zaitian like a chicken.

“Whirr…” A cold light flashed as the sword aimed for Long Zaitian’s arm. If it fell, his arm would be ruined—after all, this was the Immortal Realm; severed limbs couldn’t regenerate.

“Done…” Long Zaitian’s eyes showed despair, as if resigned. He closed his eyes.

At the moment the sword fell, Luo Tian moved. His foot pushed off the ground and he appeared in front of Long Zaitian, grabbing the falling blade.

Luo Tian’s speed was too fast. By the time people reacted, they only saw the green sword caught in a young man’s hand.

“You?” Wang Quandan looked surprised, his arm slightly pressed. But the sword didn’t budge.

“Let’s be merciful,” Luo Tian smiled and addressed Wang Quandan.

“Huh…” Long Zaitian sighed deeply, his gaze filled with relief and gratitude toward Luo Tian.

“Who are you?” Wang Quandan looked at Luo Tian. Though he was a second-generation noble, he knew some people were untouchable.

“Paying debts is natural. If you want to meddle, help him pay the money!” Wang Quandan looked at Luo Tian. Though he was strong, in Tianlong City, it wasn’t just about strength.

“This is fifty Immortal Stones. Pay part of it first; the rest, come back here in ten days!” Luo Tian waved his hand and tossed a storage bag to Wang Quandan.

“Hiss…” Seeing Luo Tian toss fifty Immortal Stones so easily, the onlookers gasped.

Fifty Immortal Stones weren’t too many but also not few. Some people could afford it, but they wouldn’t part with fifty Immortal Stones to help a stranger. In their eyes, such behavior was either foolish or rich.

“Luo Tian, this is all our money!” Long Youlan looked upset as Luo Tian waved his hand and spent their entire savings.

“Right, sir, you haven’t paid the bill yet!” The waiter heard Long Youlan’s words and also started demanding.

“An arrogant fool!” Hearing Long Youlan’s words, the people around looked at Luo Tian with contempt.

“Huh?” Wang Quandan noticed Long Youlan, his eyes flickered slightly. He licked his lips lightly.

“Exceptional!” Wang Quandan thought to himself, gazing at Long Youlan as if he wanted to devour her.

“Alright, get up. This booklet was useful for me; it’s like buying your booklet!” Luo Tian waved his hand, giving two Immortal Stones to the waiter. He also helped Long Zaitian up.

“Young Master, you are my savior!” Long Zaitian looked at Luo Tian with tears in his eyes. He had planned to cheat Luo Tian out of a meal, but instead, Luo Tian helped him without demanding repayment.

“Kid, you must pay back all the money!” But before Long Zaitian’s words finished, Wang Quandan spoke again. He weighed the storage bag in his hand and put it in his pocket.

“This…” Hearing Wang Quandan’s words, Long Zaitian's face changed again. He hadn’t expected Wang Quandan to still not let him go.

“I said ten days, so it’s ten days. In ten days, I’ll pay you back with interest!” Luo Tian frowned slightly. He really didn’t have much money; the rest of Tianyuan Sect’s resources were left with Long Li for development in Longyin City.

“You don’t have it? Then let your sister accompany me for a night. I’ll forget the remaining twenty-eight Immortal Stones!” Wang Quandan gazed greedily at Long Youlan.

“Crack… Ah…” Before Wang Quandan’s words finished, a crackling sound echoed from his body. His body fell in an abnormal posture, and his mouth, which had been twitching constantly, twitched even more violently.

Chapter 1789: Meeting Gu Qiansnow

“Ah…” A piercing scream echoed in the small restaurant. As Wang Quandan knelt down, he immediately collapsed onto the ground.

“My legs…” Wang Quandan screamed loudly, clutching his head and wailing. His legs were twisted and blood spilled onto the floor.

“This youth, I swear, he’s too strong. Doesn’t he know who this person is?” People looked at Luo Tian with shock, who stood there as if unmoved.

“Why are you still looking? Kill him for me!” Wang Quandan, though his legs were broken, remained conscious. He shouted at his subordinates.

“Attack!” Wang Quandan’s men were all at the half-Immortal Soul stage. Only two were at the Immortal Soul stage, but they dared not defy Wang Quandan’s orders. They immediately surrounded Luo Tian and rushed at him.

“Frog trying to shake a tree!” Luo Tian showed disdain. He didn’t even need to move his hands, just swung them repeatedly.

“Crack… crack…” These people came fast and left faster. One by one, their bodies flew back, each breaking their legs like Wang Quandan and landing on top of him.

“Luo Tian, you’re the best!” Long Youlan clapped her hands, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Luo… Luo Tian…” Long Zaitian heard Long Youlan’s words and his eyes went blank. Though Long Youlan had mentioned Luo Tian's name before, people hadn’t paid much attention. But now, with Luo Tian’s actions, they realized this Luo Tian must be the strongman who had fought against Wan Youlan outside Tianlong City.

“He’s Luo Tian. No wonder he's so strong and dared to provoke Wang Quandan. He even fought against Wan Youlan, let alone Wang Quandan!” People began discussing, their gazes filled with admiration.

“Lead the way to Luoxue Inn!” Luo Tian walked up to Long Zaitian and spoke softly. Then he addressed the waiter: “The broken tables and chairs, let Wang Quandan pay for them!”

After saying this, Luo Tian stepped out of the restaurant and onto the bustling street.

“Idol!” As soon as Luo Tian exited, Long Zaitian looked at him with admiration and followed closely, his gaze filled with reverence.

“Walk while talking!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly and signaled Long Zaitian to lead the way. He was desperate to find out if Gu Qiansnow, whom Long Zaitian had mentioned, was his own.

“Sure!” Long Zaitian’s face showed excitement. He then began guiding Luo Tian through the streets of Tianlong City.

“Luo Tian appeared in a restaurant and broke Wang Quandan’s legs!”

“He hasn’t shown himself for so long, but when he did, he caused trouble. He even dared to provoke the City Lord’s mansion!” As Luo Tian appeared, people in Tianlong City began spreading the news. After all, he was a strongman.

“Who is Luo Tian? I haven’t heard of him!” However, some people didn’t know who Luo Tian was. Among them were many sect disciples.

“Luo Tian!” In a courtyard, several young figures stood there. The leader was a youth with sharp eyebrows.

“Li Senior Brother, was it this Luo Tian who injured you when you went down the mountain?” The youth with sharp eyebrows smiled slightly, looking at Li Haoran standing at the back.

“Yuan Senior Brother, this Luo Tian not only injured me but also destroyed my family. Please help me avenge him, Yuan Senior Brother. If I can get revenge, my life is yours. I would never blink an eye to face fire and water!” Li Haoran’s face showed hatred, kneeling before the youth with sharp eyebrows.

“Let’s check first. We can’t make too much trouble in Tianlong City!” The youth with sharp eyebrows raised his eyebrows and spoke to the others.

“Thank you, Yuan Senior Brother!” Hearing the youth’s words, Li Haoran looked delighted. The youth with sharp eyebrows was Yuan Tianjiao. Though his name wasn’t great, he lived up to it—his talent was unmatched. At twenty, he achieved the Immortal Soul stage; at thirty-five, he reached the early Xianjing Realm. He was the youngest among them but a disciple of the sect’s master, having joined much earlier.

“Yuan Senior Brother, this is just a commoner. This small matter shouldn’t require your involvement. Let us go!” When Yuan Tianjiao spoke, a youth with a fan in hand looked down.

“Indeed, Yuan Senior Brother, you should prepare for the trials. We’ll go!” Hearing the fan youth’s words, others also nodded in agreement.

“Okay, be careful. Try not to offend the Tianlong City Lord. If it’s unavoidable, wait and see if there's an opportunity to eliminate him during the trials!” Yuan Tianjiao nodded. This time, those accompanying him were his trusted men, so he could trust them.

……

On another side, in a courtyard, Yao Qishi’s round face showed arrogance: “Damn it, Luo Tian chased me like a dog before. Today I’ll make you suffer!” Yao Qishi laughed loudly.

“Uncle Wang, let’s go kill someone!” Yao Qishi addressed a middle-aged man standing before him.

“Qishi, when you left, your grandfather instructed us to focus on the Tianlong Sect’s trials!” The middle-aged man spoke to Yao Qishi, trying to dissuade him.

“Uncle Wang, don’t worry. The Tianlong City Lord should give us the Luotian Sect some face!” Yao Qishi’s face showed madness.

“Okay…” The middle-aged man sighed, feeling this mission was indeed difficult. But he still followed Yao Qishi.

“Luo Tian, the one who attacked Miss Wan Youlan?”

“Miss Wan Youlan, don’t worry. I’ll avenge you!”

“Miss Wan Youlan, wait for me. I’ll take his arm and bring it to you!” Outside of Wan Youlan’s residence in Tianlong City, young figures shouted loudly.

Tianlong City was called a city but its size could rival a small sect. Luo Tian and his companions had walked for nearly half an hour before reaching the Luoxue Inn.

“Idol, savior! This is the Luoxue Inn!” Long Zaitian looked respectfully at the sign of the Luoxue Inn.

“Hm.” Luo Tian nodded. Throughout the journey, Long Zaitian had told him about his story.

Long Zaitian was also somewhat famous in Tianlong City, known as the “All-Knowing.” He had accumulated some wealth over the years. However, for unknown reasons, he became addicted to gambling in Tianlong City’s famous money pit and lost everything. Out of anger, he borrowed money from the casino, which was controlled by the Wang family.

Originally, Long Zaitian had borrowed ten Immortal Stones but ended up with seventy-eight due to interest. He couldn’t bear it and had been avoiding them.

“After this matter is resolved, I’ll help you with your problem!” Luo Tian spoke to Long Zaitian, his voice tense. Then he stepped into the Luoxue Inn.

The Luoxue Inn was as its name suggested, entirely white like snow. The inn’s interior was also elegant and refined, with paintings of snowy landscapes on the walls.

“Sir, our rooms are all booked!” As Luo Tian entered, a waiter approached with an apologetic face.

“I’m asking about Gu Qiansnow from Luoxue City. Is she staying here?” Luo Tian smiled and asked the waiter, while his spiritual sense spread out but was blocked by waves.

“Here!” Though Luo Tian hadn’t found anything, he had an instinct that Gu Qiansnow was inside this inn.

“Sir, Miss Gu Qiansnow doesn’t stay here!” The waiter became impatient. Many people had come looking for Gu Qiansnow, and the Luoxue Inn was a product of Luoxue City.

“Impossible!” Luo Tian refuted immediately. His instinct wasn’t wrong. He looked at the waiter.

“I said she’s not here, leave!” The waiter heard Luo Tian’s tone and sneered, pushing him away.

“Move aside!” Luo Tian waved his hand, his gaze cold. At this moment, he didn’t care about anything; even if he overturned Tianlong City, he would find Gu Qiansnow.

The waiter was no match for Luo Tian and was immediately thrown to the ground, landing with a loud crash.

“Crash…” The waiter’s body collided with the counter, making a dull sound in the quiet and elegant inn.

“Who dares to cause trouble in my Luoxue Inn!” The sound was followed by a sharp voice from the second-floor steps. Two women stood there, and other parts of the inn also had several strongmen looking at Luo Tian with hostility.

“Miss, this man wanted to see you. I said she wasn’t here, but he injured me!” The waiter pointed at Luo Tian, but found Luo Tian staring intently at his mistress on the second floor.

Black clothes, a cold face, emitting a chill. A cold aura radiated from her body.

“Qiansnow!” Luo Tian whispered, his voice trembling. The woman before him was different from his Qiansnow in clothing but otherwise identical. Who else could she be?

Luo Tian murmured softly, then pushed off the ground and leaped onto the second floor. He stood directly in front of the woman in black clothes, immediately embracing her without hesitation.

The woman on the second floor was momentarily stunned. In that moment of hesitation, she was embraced by Luo Tian.

“I’ve finally found you!” Luo Tian whispered in her ear, tightly hugging the person in his arms. He felt a familiar aura and was certain this was his wife.

“Dare to insult us!” The woman’s attendant shouted loudly.

“This time I’ll let you off. If there's a next time, I'll cut you!” Cold words came from the woman’s mouth. Her eyes held no emotion.

“How could it be!” Luo Tian seemed not to hear the woman’s words, his eyes filled with disbelief. Looking at Gu Qiansnow.

“You… don’t remember me?” Luo Tian stood up slowly, his voice trembling. He didn’t believe Gu Qiansnow would forget him. As a soul-binding master, he knew her soul hadn’t been taken over.

How long had it been? Though Gu Qiansnow had arrived in the Immortal Realm earlier, the flow of time between the Immortal Realm and the Nine Realms was different. According to Luo Tian’s calculation, Gu Qiansnow had only arrived a few days earlier.

“Don’t recognize you. Get out!” However, Gu Qiansnow’s answer struck Luo Tian like a hammer to the heart. More painful than his physical wounds was his emotional pain.

“Qiansnow, what happened to you? Why don’t you remember me?” Luo Tian murmured softly. He didn’t believe Gu Qiansnow would forget him; something must have happened to make her forget.

“Get out…” Gu Qiansnow looked at Luo Tian’s expression, frowning slightly. Though she felt uncomfortable, she coldly ordered him to leave, and with her attendant, walked toward her room.

“Gu Qiansnow, stop!” Luo Tian shouted, but she didn’t stop at all.

“Forgotten… forgotten…” Luo Tian coughed blood, his face pale as a sheet. His gaze looked at Gu Qiansnow who turned away.

“Something must be wrong!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed determination. He didn’t believe their years of love could vanish so quickly.

“After struggling to ascend to the Immortal Realm, I end up with this result!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed bitterness. His feet left a pool of blood, and his wound on the abdomen kept bleeding.

“Luo Tian…!” Long Youlan looked worried, seeing Luo Tian’s weakness and feeling deep pain.

“Arrogant!” Long Youlan saw Luo Tian's condition and wanted to curse Gu Qiansnow. Though she didn’t know the relationship between Luo Tian and this Gu Qiansnow, she could sense his despair. However, as a little girl, she wasn’t good at cursing.

“Hmph, that’s a toad dreaming of swan meat. Don’t you know your place? Go!” The waiter and several strongmen blocked Luo Tian’s view, acting like they were driving him out.

“Qiansnow, if you truly forgot me, I’ll do everything to make you remember. If you really don’t want to see me, then our marital bond ends here. From today on, you walk your path, and I’ll take mine!” Luo Tian’s face was pale. Though the meeting was brief, he hadn’t noticed any problems with Gu Qiansnow.

Though unwilling to believe it, Luo Tian had to admit that maybe Gu Qiansnow had changed. After all, she didn’t know they had arrived in the Immortal Realm. Perhaps in her mind, they couldn’t have ascended to the Immortal Realm.

“Who is your wife? If you keep causing trouble, don’t blame me for being unkind!” Again, Gu Qiansnow’s cold and emotionless voice answered Luo Tian.

“We’ll go then!” Luo Tian, as if soulless, spoke to Long Youlan and Long Zaitian. His bloodstained footprints marked the ground.

After saying this, Luo Tian said nothing more and pushed open the inn’s door to leave. Long Youlan and Long Zaitian followed closely behind.

“Miss, what’s wrong?” In Luoxue Inn's room, black mist emanated from Gu Qiansnow and was absorbed into her body. Black snow flashed in her eyes.

“Who is he? How could he move my heart?” Gu Qiansnow murmured, then her eyes returned to coldness.

“You all go back first. I’ll take a walk!” As soon as they left the inn, Luo Tian spoke to Long Youlan and Long Zaitian.

“I’ll accompany you!” Long Youlan looked worried. Luo Tian’s injuries showed no signs of improvement.

“I’m fine. I just need to be alone and think about some things. Be good, I’ll return tonight!” Luo Tian smiled slightly, but this smile looked more painful than crying to Long Youlan and Long Zaitian.

“Okay!” However, Long Youlan also felt Luo Tian’s sorrow. She nodded and followed Long Zaitian to the inn where she and Luo Tian were staying.

Tianlong City’s streets remained lively. After talking to Long Youlan, Luo Tian wandered aimlessly through the city's streets. The lively scenes around him seemed to isolate Luo Tian, and even some passersby could feel the sorrow radiating from Luo Tian.

“Why?” Luo Tian still didn’t believe Gu Qiansnow had forgotten him so quickly. After all, he knew her personality.

“What made Qiansnow change so much? Temptation? Impossible!”

“Why is she wearing black clothes?” As he walked, Luo Tian kept thinking about Gu Qiansnow’s differences from before.

“She used to hate black clothes!” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, his eyes becoming serious.

“If it weren’t for knowing Qiansnow’s soul hadn’t changed, this would be a completely different person!” Luo Tian was confused and believed something must have gone wrong with Gu Qiansnow.

“I’ll find the truth. Even if it’s the worst, I need to know what happened to Qiansnow during this time!” Luo Tian's eyes gradually became determined.

“Huh…” The wind blew, bringing Luo Tian back to reality. His abdominal wound had stopped bleeding, but the hole remained.

“Her strike was heavy!” Luo Tian could feel that if he had pushed further, Gu Qiansnow would have killed him. In that case, he wouldn’t just die unfairly but also feel embarrassed.

Chapter 1790: Who Are You?

“Peng…” A cold aura surged, instantly invading Luo Tian’s entire body. What felt more chilling was the cold gaze.

A black sword pierced through Luo Tian's back, its tip dripping with blood. Long Zaitian and Long Youlan were filled with shock.

A flexible leg kicked Luo Tian’s body, sending him crashing down from the second floor of the inn.

“Peng…” A dull sound echoed in the inn. Luo Tian lay on the ground, his gaze still fixed on Gu Qiansnow holding a bloodstained black sword.

“Dare to insult our mistress!” The attendant shouted loudly.

“If you don’t have a second time, I’ll cut you!” Cold words came from Gu Qiansnow’s mouth. Her eyes held no emotion.

“How could it be!” Luo Tian seemed not to hear Gu Qiansnow’s words, his eyes filled with disbelief. Looking at Gu Qiansnow.

“You… don’t remember me?” Luo Tian stood up slowly, his voice trembling. He didn’t believe Gu Qiansnow would forget him. As a soul-binding master, he knew her soul hadn’t been taken over.

How long had it been? Though Gu Qiansnow arrived in the Immortal Realm earlier, the flow of time between the Immortal Realm and the Nine Realms was different. According to Luo Tian’s calculation, Gu Qiansnow had only arrived a few days earlier.

“Don’t recognize you. Get out!” However, Gu Qiansnow’s answer struck Luo Tian like a hammer to the heart. More painful than his physical wounds was his emotional pain.

“Qiansnow, what happened to you? Why don’t you remember me?” Luo Tian murmured softly. He didn’t believe Gu Qiansnow would forget him; something must have happened to make her forget.

“Get out…” Gu Qiansnow looked at Luo Tian’s expression, frowning slightly. Though she felt uncomfortable, she coldly ordered him to leave, and with her attendant, walked toward her room.

“Gu Qiansnow, stop!” Luo Tian shouted, but she didn’t stop at all.

“Forgotten… forgotten…” Luo Tian coughed blood, his face pale as a sheet. His gaze looked at Gu Qiansnow who turned away.

“Something must be wrong!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed determination. He didn’t believe their years of love could vanish so quickly.

“After struggling to ascend to the Immortal Realm, I end up with this result!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed bitterness. His feet left a pool of blood, and his wound on the abdomen kept bleeding.

“Luo Tian…!” Long Youlan looked worried, seeing Luo Tian’s weakness and feeling deep pain.

“Arrogant!” Long Youlan saw Luo Tian's condition and wanted to curse Gu Qiansnow. Though she didn’t know the relationship between Luo Tian and this Gu Qiansnow, she could sense his despair. However, as a little girl, she wasn’t good at cursing.

“Hmph, that’s a toad dreaming of swan meat. Don’t you know your place? Go!” The waiter and several strongmen blocked Luo Tian’s view, acting like they were driving him out.

“Qiansnow, if you truly forgot me, I’ll do everything to make you remember. If you really don’t want to see me, then our marital bond ends here. From today on, you walk your path, and I’ll take mine!” Luo Tian’s face was pale. Though the meeting was brief, he hadn’t noticed any problems with Gu Qiansnow.

Though unwilling to believe it, Luo Tian had to admit that maybe Gu Qiansnow had changed. After all, she didn’t know they had arrived in the Immortal Realm. Perhaps in her mind, they couldn’t have ascended to the Immortal Realm.

“Who is your wife? If you keep causing trouble, don’t blame me for being unkind!” Again, Gu Qiansnow’s cold and emotionless voice answered Luo Tian.

“We’ll go then!” Luo Tian, as if soulless, spoke to Long Youlan and Long Zaitian. His bloodstained footprints marked the ground.

After saying this, Luo Tian said nothing more and pushed open the inn’s door to leave. Long Youlan and Long Zaitian followed closely behind.

“Miss, what’s wrong?” In Luoxue Inn's room, black mist emanated from Gu Qiansnow and was absorbed into her body. Black snow flashed in her eyes.

“Who is he? How could he move my heart?” Gu Qiansnow murmured, then her eyes returned to coldness.

“You all go back first. I’ll take a walk!” As soon as they left the inn, Luo Tian spoke to Long Youlan and Long Zaitian.

“I’ll accompany you!” Long Youlan looked worried. Luo Tian’s injuries showed no signs of improvement.

“I’m fine. I just need to be alone and think about some things. Be good, I’ll return tonight!” Luo Tian smiled slightly, but this smile looked more painful than crying to Long Youlan and Long Zaitian.

“Okay!” However, Long Youlan also felt Luo Tian’s sorrow. She nodded and followed Long Zaitian to the inn where she and Luo Tian were staying.

Tianlong City’s streets remained lively. After talking to Long Youlan, Luo Tian wandered aimlessly through the city's streets. The lively scenes around him seemed to isolate Luo Tian, and even some passersby could feel the sorrow radiating from Luo Tian.

“Why?” Luo Tian still didn’t believe Gu Qiansnow had forgotten him so quickly. After all, he knew her personality.

“What made Qiansnow change so much? Temptation? Impossible!”

“Why is she wearing black clothes?” As he walked, Luo Tian kept thinking about Gu Qiansnow’s differences from before.

“She used to hate black clothes!” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, his eyes becoming serious.

“If it weren’t for knowing Qiansnow’s soul hadn’t changed, this would be a completely different person!” Luo Tian was confused and believed something must have gone wrong with Gu Qiansnow.

“I’ll find the truth. Even if it’s the worst, I need to know what happened to Qiansnow during this time!” Luo Tian's eyes gradually became determined.

“Huh…” The wind blew, bringing Luo Tian back to reality. His abdominal wound had stopped bleeding, but the hole remained.

“Her strike was heavy!” Luo Tian could feel that if he had pushed further, Gu Qiansnow would have killed him. In that case, he wouldn’t just die unfairly but also feel embarrassed.
