“Seems the Feng Clan has developed rapidly recently. They even have three individuals from the Early Epoch!” Long Jie let out a cold snort, recalling how the Feng Clan had betrayed the Demon Domain and inflicted heavy damage upon it. Had it not been for himself, Diao Yuanshan, and Diao Dezhu's formidable suppression, the Demon Domain might have already crumbled.

“Ming Clan!” Luotian gazed at the three souls, his expression turning solemn. Though he too sensed the aura of the Feng Clan, it was a familiar fluctuation that came from the Origin Domain—the aura of the Ming Clan.

“Could it be that the ancient royal Ming Clan has emerged from the Origin Domain?” Luotian furrowed his brows, but soon dismissed the thought.

The Ming Clan was immensely powerful. If they had truly appeared, they would not have remained so low-key; perhaps they would have directly marched into the Nine Domains.

“Ming Zhenyan!” In an instant, Luotian recalled a person who had long vanished—Ming Domain’s Nine Saints’ second-in-command, an individual from the Late Epoch.

Back then, Luotian and Meng Lingyun had jointly slain Ming Haoyan at the peak of the Epoch, but they had not pursued the fleeing Ming Zhenyan. Over a decade later, Ming Zhenyan’s injuries were certainly healed.

“Has the Feng Clan conspired with Ming Zhenyan?” Long Jie asked, his voice laced with anger.

“Possibly. Let’s continue. See which other forces wish to oppose our Four Sacred Star Domains!” Luotian's eyes flashed with cold determination. He nodded to Xu Liyi, retrieving the three souls and vanishing from Xu Liyi’s sight once more.

For the following month, the entire Nine Domains became chaotic due to Luotian’s actions. Various sects saw their disciples fall, and even the Saint Heirs were assassinated. The great sects in the Nine Domains grew anxious.

The situation escalated further, with new Saint Heirs from various sacred clans also falling victim to assassins. No one knew who was behind it.

The most shocking event was when Sun Miechen’s son, the new Divine Heir of the Divine Clan, was nearly struck down by a single slap. Had Sun Miechen not intervened promptly and equipped his son with numerous life-preserving measures, he might have perished in the Divine-Mortal Domain.

“Who is this terrifying force that dares attack even the Divine Heir?” People murmured, speculating about which faction had emerged so recklessly.

Soon, attention turned to the Four Sacred Star Domains. After all, every prodigy of the Four Sacred Star Domains had once faced assassination. People suspected it was retaliation from the Four Sacred Star Domains.

However, without evidence, people could only speculate. The assassins had acted ruthlessly and struck only once before retreating without lingering.

While people suspected the Four Sacred Star Domains, Luotian’s disciple Dong Yichen was also targeted while外出 (outgoing), sustaining injuries before returning to the Four Sacred Star Domains. This left people bewildered.

Throughout the Nine Domains, undercurrents surged as more and more reports of Saint Heirs being assassinated surfaced. The perpetrators had all targeted the unestablished Saint Heirs of various sacred clans.

Meanwhile, Luotian and his companions, along with Xu Liyi, had gathered considerable rewards. They wandered through the Nine Domains, drawing out numerous strong individuals, who were ultimately all absorbed by Luotian’s soul.

A wave of chaos spread across the Nine Domains, as if an invisible hand guided its course.

“Not a single domain has escaped!” Luotian frowned slightly. Though they had acted with clear objectives, their targets were only the sects in the Divine-Mortal Domain that favored the Divine Clan and those closely allied with the Feng Clan. They had not acted against the Chaos Domain or the Revenant Domain.

“Who is orchestrating all this?” Luotian pondered, feeling as if he were being led by the nose.

“Stop it!” Finally, the Divine Clan’s Divine King, Sun Miechen, spoke up. He invited all sacred domains to gather at the Divine Clan to discuss the assassinations of the Saint Heirs.

“You think you can just stop it? When you attacked others, where were you? Now it's too late. As long as your son steps out of the Divine Mountains, we will make him bleed!” However, after Sun Miechen spoke, a strong voice responded defiantly, vowing to completely eliminate the Divine Clan’s Saint Heir.

This outburst caused a storm across the Nine Domains, shaking it like a tempest.

The Divine Clan was currently the dominant force in the Nine Domains. Though the Ming Domain had caused chaos and lost its strength, Sun Miechen had upheld it through his own means. His cultivation was at the Mid-Epoch, ranking second among the immortal bodies—no one could rival him. It was said that Sun Miechen’s strength had even surpassed the old Divine King, Sun Shengtian.

Daring to confront Sun Miechen so boldly, the opponent must have been incredibly confident.

People discerned the meaning behind the voice: it suggested that the Divine Clan might have previously assassinated other sacred domains’ Saint Heirs. The first to be targeted was the Four Sacred Star Domains.

The Four Sacred Star Domains were now incredibly powerful, their strength unmatched by the other domains.

“Is this a provocation or is it truly happening? Will the sacred domains plunge into war?” People wondered. The conflicts between sacred domains were beyond their control, as they were all titans.

“Ten days later, I will go to the Four Sacred Star Domains to clear up this misunderstanding!” Sun Miehan clearly could not determine who had spoken, but his words implied clearing the confusion. Yet he spoke with an air of superiority, as if coming to accuse.

Luotian and his group naturally received the news and ceased their actions, returning to the Tianyuan Continent.

“Revenant Domain: Ten days later, I will go to the Four Sacred Star Domains!” Before Sun Miechen’s words had even faded, Yan Hongtao, the new Revenant Domain Master, also spoke.

“Star-Seeking Domain Master Zhou Wei: Ten days later, I will go to the Four Sacred Star Domains…” The other domain masters also spoke in succession.

“Four Sacred Star Domains are about to become a hub of chaos!” The entire Nine Domains trembled as the domain masters spoke.

“What’s going on? Why are all these people coming out now? Did they all go mad? This is such a clear provocation, yet they still fell for it.”

“Perhaps,” Luotian sighed deeply. He hadn’t expected the situation to escalate so far.

“Hope they don’t go too far; otherwise, they won’t be able to bear the consequences!” Luotian’s eyes flashed with coldness. He felt that the Four Sacred Star Domains were being targeted by a terrifying force.

Ten days passed in the blink of an eye. Amid people’s anxious waiting, a golden light flashed from the Four Sacred Star Domains’ teleportation array. Sun Miechen’s figure appeared like a god, descending into the Four Sacred Star Domains.

“Four Sacred Star Domains! It’s been a long time since I last came!” Sun Miechen radiated an overwhelming aura. He arrived alone, descending directly onto the Five Elements Mountain of Tianyuan Continent.

“Divine Clan’s Divine King Sun Miechen requests an audience with the people of Tianyuan Continent!” Sun Miechen smiled and shouted toward the Five Elements Mountain, his voice carrying a powerful fluctuation that caused the massive Five Elements Mountain to tremble.

“Haha, the Divine King of the Divine Clan has arrived. My apologies for not welcoming you properly!” Jiang Nanxuan calmly emerged from the Five Elements Mountain, his gaze calm as he looked at Sun Miechen.

“Sun Miechen, how bold of you!” Before Sun Miechen could speak, Long Jie’s face showed disdain. He and Diao Dezhu flew over from a distance, their eyes filled with intense battle intent.

“Ah, the Domain Master of the Demon Domain!” Sun Miechen’s eyes flickered with a hint of amusement but ignored the battle intent radiating from Sun Miechen.

“I have come to resolve this misunderstanding, not to be enemies with the Four Sacred Star Domains!” Sun Miechen smiled and looked at Jiang Nanxuan and those who appeared behind him, including Xu Liyi.

Chapter 1388: Reuniting ()

“Good, the Four Sacred Star Domains naturally welcome you!” Jiang Nanxuan smiled and extended his hand to invite Sun Miechen into the Five Elements Mountain.

“Star-Seeking Domain Master Zhou Wei, come to greet old friends!” As the group was about to enter the Five Elements Mountain, streaks of starlight flashed. Zhou Wei’s figure appeared in people's sight.

“Chaos Domain Master Zhu Ge, I have come to inquire about the incident where my domain’s Saint Heir was ambushed!” As Zhou Wei's words finished, two figures in gray emerged from the void, their presence shrouded in mist.

“Haha, all old friends!” Yan Hongtao’s figure flickered into view, standing atop the sky with his qi roaring.

“Everyone has arrived!” Luotian changed his form and stood behind Zheng Xin Gulei, observing the current generation of top-tier warriors among the Nine Domains. His eyes reflected a sense of admiration.

“Time flows like water; in such a short time, the old generation has retreated into the background. New prodigies have emerged. Perhaps in several decades, Dong Yichen’s generation will also fade from people's sight!” Luotian mused internally.

“Everyone, we are old friends. After our parting at the Demon Mountain, it seems this is the first time we’ve gathered so neatly!” Zhou Wei spoke softly, scanning over everyone.

“Unfortunately, that person has perished. Otherwise, it would have been even more lively!” Yan Hongtao spoke softly, recalling the one who had once made them gasp for breath.

“Unfortunately, I never got to fight him. That remains a lifelong regret!” Zhu Ge sighed softly, accompanied by his younger brother, Zhu Gechao, who had been severely beaten by Luotian.

“Don’t be so arrogant. If you had fought him, you would have known that there are always people beyond one’s comprehension!” Yan Hongtao's eyes showed disdain.

“Even the strongest eventually becomes a pile of dust!” Zhu Gechao’s face bore disdain as he spoke.

“Zhu Gechao!” Long Jie's expression changed upon hearing Zhu Gechao’s words, his gaze deep and intense as he stared at him.

“Go… the Four Sacred Star Domains do not welcome you!” Zheng Xin Gulei and others also spoke loudly, their voices laced with hostility.

Even Zhou Wei and Yan Hongtao showed frowns, their gazes filled with displeasure toward Zhu Gechao.

Everyone had witnessed how Luotian died. If it hadn’t been for the Nine Domains, he wouldn’t have perished.

“Apologies to everyone!” Zhu Ge’s expression also shifted slightly before he bowed respectfully toward the people of Tianyuan Continent.

“Did I say anything wrong?”

“Indeed, Luotian was a great hero for the Nine Domains. However, he still perished! After so many years, although the Four Sacred Star Domains have produced excellent prodigies, none can match Luotian’s strength!” Zhu Ge spoke again.

“Master Zhu, do you have something against me?” Jiang Nanxuan smiled gently, his gaze calm as he looked at Zhu Gechao.

Long Jie was more direct. He opened his mouth and spat out a long chain that cut through the sky, instantly rushing toward Zhu Ge with a roar.

Seeing Long Jie’s attack, Zhu Ge, who stood beside Zhu Gechao, narrowed his eyes. He extended a hand, surrounding himself with gray qi and pushing out a palm to block Long Jie’s attack.

“Enough, everyone. We came here not to fight but to resolve the issue. If you wish to fight, do so after resolving it!” Sun Miechen, who had been standing quietly, spoke softly.

“Please enter Tianyuan to discuss!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke again, inviting everyone into a grand hall of the Five Elements Gate.

“Everyone must have had a tough time recently, right?” Sun Miechen spoke first, his gaze on Jiang Nanxuan.

Upon hearing Sun Miechen’s words, everyone fell silent. The Saint Heirs of various domains had all faced assassinations, yet they hadn’t discovered the perpetrators. This left them quite troubled.

“Let’s be straightforward. I can assure you here that regardless of past events, the Divine Clan will no longer attack any Saint Heirs of sacred domains!” Sun Miechen smiled and spoke to everyone.

“Good. Since you’ve spoken, let’s all stop hiding our cards. The Revenant Domain only values money, so over the years we’ve accepted payments to assassinate certain Saint Heirs of sacred domains!” Yan Hongtao smiled slightly, scanning over everyone.

“However, those in our line of work have rules. We cannot reveal the employer’s identity, so I can’t tell you. But today, I can assure that the Revenant Domain will no longer accept tasks to assassinate Saint Heirs of sacred domains!” Yan Hongtao continued, his voice sincere.

Everyone nodded and also expressed their positions. The discussion proceeded smoothly since it benefited every domain.

“Yan Brother, the current situation in the Nine Domains is that the former Saint Heir of the Thunder Domain has entered the Thunder Sea Marsh and hasn’t returned yet. The Thunder Domain is clearly leaderless now. Why hasn’t the Revenant Domain moved there?” Sun Miechen spoke softly.

“The Revenant Domain’s rule is survival of the fittest. It has been like this for many years, and it's this rule that allowed the Revenant Domain to rise to its current status. The Thunder Domain is good, but if it were truly moved there, the conditions would improve, and people would lose their desire to compete. That would be detrimental to the Revenant Domain!” Yan Hongtao shook his head lightly.

“Since everyone has assured us, I’ll have someone prepare a feast. It’s been a long time since we’ve met; let's catch up!” Jiang Nanxuan smiled and spoke.

“Catching up can wait. I have another matter to ask of Master Jiang!” Sun Miechen smiled, his gaze on Jiang Nanxuan.

“Master Sun, please speak freely!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, though a bad feeling stirred in his heart.

“Back then, three audacious individuals slaughtered the entire Yin-Yang Sect within my Divine-Mortal Domain. I suppose Master Jiang has heard of this?” Sun Miechen’s eyes flashed with golden light, scanning over Zheng Xin and others behind Jiang Nanxuan before settling on Luotian and Sun Kemin.

“Have they been discovered?” Luotian’s eyes widened, disbelief coursing through him. The Mirage Mask had even eluded the perception of an Epoch Peak powerhouse; how could Sun Miechen have seen through it?

“Of course I’ve heard of it!” Jiang Nanxuan’s heart tightened slightly, but his expression remained calm and smiling as he looked at Sun Miechen.

“I received information that those three are currently within the Four Sacred Star Domains. I hope Master Jiang will grant me a favor and hand them over to me!” Sun Miechen’s gaze bore into Luotian and Sun Kemin, causing them to feel uneasy.

“Is there something wrong?” Luotian pondered internally. Where had he made a mistake? But ultimately, he found no clues.

“Master Sun speaks in jest. The Four Sacred Star Domains may not be a major domain, but it is vast. If Master Sun can find them, I will naturally grant you the favor!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly.

“Do not know these two brothers’ origins. They seem unfamiliar!” Sun Miechen’s gaze swept over Luotian and his companions, addressing Jiang Nanxuan.

Upon hearing Sun Miechen’s words, Zheng Xin and Gu Lei grew tense.

Zhou Wei and Yan Hongtao also directed their gazes toward Luotian and Sun Kemin, their eyes filled with confusion.

“Sun Kemin has hidden himself well!” Before anyone could speak, Sun Miechen coldly spoke, his eyes gleaming as he stared at Sun Kemin.

“Did you think your transformation technique was unmatched in the world?” Sun Miechen first glanced at Sun Kemin, his voice icy.

“I didn’t see through me!” Luotian sighed in relief. He knew Sun Miechen might have a way to see through Sun Kemin.

“Still, this brother has remarkable skills. He’s hidden so deeply that even I couldn’t discern his true face!” Sun Miechen then turned his gaze to Luotian.

“Haha, since I’ve been discovered, I won’t hide anymore!” Luotian laughed and lightly touched his face, transforming it into the image of Sima Tuo, a lecherous figure vastly different from his usual appearance.

“Indeed it’s you two!” Sun Miechen’s eyes flashed with coldness, his gaze filled with killing intent.

“Why did you destroy my Divine-Mortal Domain’s Yin-Yang Sect?” Sun Miechen spoke solemnly, his gaze filled with scrutiny.

“Need I say? You don’t know what you’ve done yourself!” Luotian chuckled, his words implying something.

“Master Jiang, your previous words still hold. Hand them over to me. Let it be a favor to the Four Sacred Star Domains!” Sun Miechen spoke to Jiang Nanxuan, his voice commanding with no room for negotiation.

“Sun Miechen, what are you? You think too highly of yourself. You came to our Four Sacred Star Domains to take them, but this is the Four Sacred Star Domains. Not your Divine Clan!” Zheng Xin and Gu Lei shouted at Sun Miechen’s condescending attitude.

“Indeed, he was almost killed by Luotian with a single slap. What makes him so proud!” Sun Kemin’s eyes showed disdain. If it came to actual combat strength, he had great confidence in himself.

“Master Jiang, I just want to ask—will you grant this favor or not?” Sun Kemin ignored the others’ scolding, his gaze fixed on Jiang Nanxuan with a threatening tone.

“Master Sun, we cannot hand them over. Please grant us this favor and let it be resolved!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, his voice resolute.

“Two thieves who are wanted by everyone. The Four Sacred Star Domains have become increasingly bold!”

“Merely because of Luotian’s achievements, they’ve grown strong. If it hadn’t been for Luotian sacrificing himself for the Nine Domains, we domains would have taken care of them. Don’t forget who helped you!” Without waiting for Sun Miechen to speak, Zhu Gechao spoke sarcastically.

Chapter 1389: This Isn’t Cheating ()

“Zhu Gechao, the Four Sacred Star Domains’ matters don’t concern you!” Zheng Xin and Gu Lei’s expressions darkened upon hearing Zhu Gechao’s words, they shouted at him.

“Everything I said is the truth. The Nine Domains’ current strength isn’t all due to Luotian sacrificing himself? If it hadn’t been for our assistance, the Four Sacred Star Domains would still be the weakest!” Zhu Gechao spoke softly, his voice laced with deep disdain.

“Go…!” Upon hearing Zhu Gechao’s words, Jiang Nanxuan’s expression finally changed. His usually calm eyes flashed with intense light as he gazed at Zhu Gechao.

Jiang Nanxuan was currently seen by outsiders as the pillar of the Four Sacred Star Domains. Though he appeared amiable, Luotian knew that if anyone asked who was the most terrifying among the Four Sacred Star Domains, Luotian would definitely say it was Jiang Nanxuan.

“Hum…”, the sound of humming echoed, and the Ancient Heaven Palace radiated golden light. The aurora swept across, descending upon everyone, giving a sense of warmth but also making them feel cold within.

“Zhu Gechao, from the moment we met, you’ve constantly insulted our Four Sacred Star Domains. What does this mean? For so long, we’ve endured enough. Do you think we dare to tear our faces off?” Jiang Nanxuan spoke coldly, his gaze stern as he looked at Zhu Gechao.

“Foolish creature, dare to refuse a favor!” Zhu Gechao had been mocking and sneering since the moment they met, which completely enraged the Four Sacred Star Domains. They all shouted at him.

Luotian stood among the crowd, his expression still carrying a smile. From start to finish, he seemed like an observer, watching the expressions of those around him.

Sun Miechen’s expression was calm. Zhou Wei wore a playful look, while Yan Hongtao showed interest. As for Zhu Ge, his expression turned dark.

“Jiang Nanxuan, what do you mean? Do you want to start a conflict with the Chaos Domain?” Zhu Ge’s expression was cold. He extended his hand, and an overwhelming power surged forth. An ancient bell in gray emerged from Zhu Ge’s hands, slowly floating forward.

“Chaos Bell! Zhu Ge, you’ve brought the Epoch Treasure of the Chaos Domain here!” Upon seeing the gray bell, Jiang Nanxuan and others gasped.

“Master Jiang, I have no choice. Our lives are at stake!” Zhu Ge’s eyes flickered with gray qi, sending the Chaos Bell toward the front of the Ancient Heaven Palace. It stood in opposition to the Ancient Heaven Palace.

Two Epoch Treasures, both radiating immense power. If they collided, it would be earth-shattering. Such weapons were originally meant to intimidate. Now that their strength had grown, they could unleash some of the Epoch Treasures’ power. It was like when Gu Tian had once resisted the Divine Clan’s strength, causing the entire Divine Clan continent to be submerged in that battle.

“Chaos Domain has become increasingly arrogant!” Long Jie’s face showed a cold smile. The Divine Emperor Mirror radiated light, hovering over everyone's heads.

A powerful pressure immediately swept across the Tianyuan Continent, making its people feel fear.

“Enough, everyone. Let’s discuss the matter at hand!” Diao Dezhu spoke with disdain, addressing them.

Diao Dezhu knew that none of them would fight. Their strengths were roughly equal, and no one could overcome the others. Even if the Tianyuan Continent was destroyed today, Jiang Nanxuan would bring the Ancient Heaven Palace to stir up chaos in the Chaos Domain tomorrow.

In this great era, prodigies bloomed. If it were another time, any one of them would have been an unbeatable force. But they were born in this great era, where many others with the same talent existed. It was both a tragedy and a blessing.

“Hand over these two thieves, and it’s settled!” Sun Miechen frowned slightly. His gaze swept over Luotian and Sun Kemin before addressing everyone.

“Impossible!” The people of the Four Sacred Star Domains responded strongly, showing no room for negotiation. Their gazes were intense as they looked at Sun Miechen, and the situation momentarily became tense.

“Enough. Let me say something. We are all cultivators, relying on our strength. Although these two have poor character, they are also prodigies. If they can match any of us, then this matter will be resolved. After all, the Yin-Yang Sect has already been destroyed. Let it be a favor to the Four Sacred Star Domains!”

“Of course, if they can’t withstand it, then leave the final decision to Master Sun!” Zhou Wei gazed deeply at Luotian. His eyes flickered with patterns, and even his forehead bore a star that radiated light, scanning over Luotian. It seemed he wanted to scrutinize him thoroughly.

“Good, I have no objections!” Sun Miechen smiled slightly. His gaze turned to Luotian and Sun Kemin.

“This…”, Zheng Xin and Gu Lei looked troubled, wanting to let Luotian choose.

“Why are the people of the Four Sacred Star Domains so protective of these two? And now, they even look to Sun Kemin and Sima Tuo for decisions. They said that Sun Kemin and Sima Tuo were being chased by the Four Sacred Star Domains without a place to hide!” They all had sharp minds and quickly noticed something different about Luotian and Sun Kemin.

“I have no objections!” Before anyone could react, Luotian spoke loudly in Sima Tuo’s voice. He had noticed the people's doubts. If he gave them more time to think, these sharp minds might come up with something.

“Haha, really bold thieves. First of all, don’t choose the people from the Four Sacred Star Domains; otherwise, it won’t be good if they hold back!” Zhu Gechao’s eyes showed disdain as he spoke to Luotian and Sun Kemin.

Others hadn’t expected Luotian to agree so quickly. Their expressions showed disbelief.

After all, these people were what? None of them were ordinary. Each was a domain master-level powerhouse. Although Sun Kemin and Sima Tuo had fame, they only gained it after killing many disciples in front of the Divine-Mortal Ancient Cave years ago.

Everyone was very doubtful about Sun Kemin and Luotian’s chances of winning. If they truly won, it would be a huge reputation.

“I choose this bastard!” Before anyone could react, Sun Kemin’s face showed amusement. He pointed his finger at Zhu Gechao's face.

“What?” Zhu Gechao immediately jumped up, his eyes filled with anger. Sun Kemin had clearly chosen him as the weakest.

“Don’t jump, I’ve chosen you!” Sun Kemin’s face showed amusement. He looked at Zhu Gechao standing there and spoke softly.

“Good, good, good! Since it’s like this, I’ll make you regret it!” Zhu Gechao panted heavily. His gaze looked at Sun Kemin.

Upon seeing Sun Kemin’s choice, everyone nodded in agreement. Zhu Gechao's strength was the weakest among them.

But that was compared to them. However, Zhu Gechao’s strength had always been among the top. He had taken over his brother's role, defeating countless enemies. Though he eventually lost to Luotian, no one could suppress him.

“Who regrets? It’s not certain!” Sun Kemin showed a hint of disdain, looking at Zhu Gechao with contempt.

“Since it’s like this, everyone can go to the Ancient Heaven Palace for the match!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke. He extended his hand, and a brilliant light enveloped everyone.

Long Jie and Zhu Ge also put away the Divine Emperor Mirror and Chaos Bell. The Ancient Heaven Palace's light enveloped them, and they disappeared from the Tianyuan Continent.

“Hum…” The four spirit beings of Meng Yunxiao had already prepared a battlefield. They then disappeared from people's sight.

“Alright, Sun Kemin, come and die!” Zhu Gechao spoke with a sinister tone. He flew onto the battlefield, his eyes filled with disdain.

“Haha! I’ll show you how to crush you today!” Sun Kemin roared, his power rising. He quickly stepped onto the battlefield.

Luotian relaxed his brows. In this Ancient Heaven Palace, he had no real concerns. He glanced at Sun Miechen and Zhu Ge, thinking whether to eliminate them within the Ancient Heaven Palace.

But Luotian only thought about it. Sun Miechen and Zhu Ge weren’t fools; without special means of protection, they wouldn’t have entered the Ancient Heaven Palace.

“Chaos Producing Green Thunder!” As Luotian was thinking, a deep voice rose from the battlefield. The entire arena turned gray, as if the world had just begun. A series of green lightning bolts, imbued with heavenly laws, roamed within the gray aura—Zhu Gechao’s signature technique.

“Hmph. Knowing a few techniques makes you so proud? I’ll crush you with one hand!” Sun Kemin shouted, his words defiant. Yet he felt the immense power of those green lightning bolts.

“Die!” A series of green lightning bolts transformed into green serpents, rushing toward Sun Kemin as if to destroy him completely.

“I said I’d crush you with one hand, and I will!” Sun Kemin snorted. He leaped into the air and waved his hand. In an instant, a brilliant light illuminated the entire Ancient Heaven Palace.

“Hum…” A pressure swept across. In the radiant light of the ultimate path, a white fish appeared, seemingly swimming within the light. It exhaled a river of pure white light toward Zhu Gechao.

As this river approached Zhu Gechao, everyone's faces changed. They looked at the white fish in the sky.

“This isn’t cheating, is it?” Long Jie felt a bit embarrassed. He looked at the Yang Fish in the sky and spoke softly.

Chapter 1390: Re-fighting Zhu Gechao ()

In the first level of the Ancient Heaven Palace, the white Yang Fish radiated intense ultimate light. It pressed down on Zhu Gechao, causing people's faces to shift oddly.

“Damn it! You’re cheating!” Zhu Gechao trembled in his heart. Under the ultimate pressure, his body began to shake as if he were about to be refined.

“Why is it cheating? I said no one could use an Epoch Treasure. Is this one considered an Epoch Treasure?” Sun Kemin stood high above, looking down at Zhu Gechao with a slight sneer.

“Really shameless. You’re even more shameless than a puppy!” Zheng Xin couldn’t help but speak softly, his eyes filled with admiration.

“Who did you say?” Diao Dezhu immediately became unwilling and rushed toward Zheng Xin.

“You said I’m a dog, I’ll fight you. However, this Sun Kemin does have some of my true skills. I’m starting to like him more and more, hahaha!” Diao Dezhu looked at the flirtatious Sun Kemin in the sky and sighed softly.

“Come on, you wanted to kill me. Come up here!” Sun Kemin shouted arrogantly, urging the Yang Fish to press down on Zhu Gechao.

“Damn it!” Zhu Gechao’s face was drenched in sweat. His body emitted a series of cracks, his eyes filled with anger as he looked at Sun Kemin in the sky. He longed to pull him down and stomp on his face.

But the Yang Fish was not an Epoch Treasure. It was one of the three components of an Epoch Treasure. Under Sun Kemin’s control, it wasn’t inferior to one wielded by someone at the Mid-Epoch. This left Zhu Gechao unable to resist.

“We surrender!” Zhu Ge’s cold snort, his gray qi flickering. He rushed into the area covered by the Yang Fish and pulled Zhu Gechao back.

“Hmm?” Upon seeing Zhu Ge’s actions, Luotian's brows slightly furrowed. His eyes showed surprise. He hadn’t expected Zhu Ge to be so strong, able to pull Zhu Gechao out under such pressure.

Not only was Luotian surprised, but Sun Miechen and Yan Hongtao also changed their gazes. Their expressions turned different toward Zhu Ge.

“Indeed, the mysterious and powerful mixed-body!” Everyone’s faces showed solemnity. They looked at Zhu Ge with admiration, as being able to leave under the Yang Fish’s pressure was enough to show his strength.

“Alright!” Sun Kemin retracted the Yang Fish and flew down in front of everyone. His face showed no shame at all.

“Now it’s your turn, Sima Tuo!” People naturally turned their gaze to Luotian, who had transformed into Sima Tuo.

“Good!” Luotian smiled slightly. He looked at Zhu Gechao and said, “I choose him too!”

“This…”, upon hearing Luotian’s words, people looked at Sima Tuo's lecherous figure. Sun Miechen and others showed disdain.

“You really think I’m a pushover!” Zhu Gechao’s heart was filled with rage. His eyes turned fierce toward Luotian.

“Come on, come on!” Zhu Gechao hadn’t suffered any injuries. Seeing Luotian had chosen him again, his aura surged once more.

“Hum…” Before Zhu Gechao could finish speaking, Luotian also waved his hand. Dark qi surged forth, and a black Yin Fish rushed out, as if it could devour everything. It appeared above Luotian’s head.

“Damn!” Upon seeing the Yin Fish above Luotian, Zhu Gechao finally couldn’t hold back and cursed.

“Can you at least have some dignity! Don’t be afraid to fight with your true strength!” Zhu Gechao’s face showed a sense of frustration.

He was obviously powerful. First, he had been crushed by Sun Kemin’s Yang Fish, leaving him deeply embarrassed. He had hoped to regain some dignity against Luotian but hadn’t expected Luotian to be so shameless, using the Yin Fish.

“Where did this Yin Fish come from? It’s not Luotian’s, is it?” Sun Miechen and others showed confusion.

“I borrowed it from him. You didn’t say I couldn’t use it, did you?” Luotian smiled with mockery. Combined with Sima Tuo’s face, it was even more tempting to hit him.

“Be a man and fight me properly!” Zhu Gechao’s face turned red. His eyes showed reluctance as he roared at Luotian, his entire body radiating a powerful aura.

“I’ve given you one chance. No more!” Zhu Ge’s face also darkened. Luotian's blatant trickery made him feel uneasy.

Sun Miechen’s face also showed a grim expression. He looked at the Yin Fish's shell and then at Jiang Nanxuan.

“Good! I’ll grant your wish!” Luotian sneered and retrieved the Yin Fish. The Heavenly Thunder Sword fell into his hand, and he looked at Zhu Gechao with the same infuriating demeanor.

“No Yin Fish shell. I can still crush you!” Luotian spoke softly, his voice laced with disdain.

“Dream on! Without treasures, you’re nothing to me!” Zhu Gechao sneered and looked at Luotian standing there with the Heavenly Thunder Sword. He flew forward, turning into a streak of gray light and rushing toward Luotian.

In the thunderous clash, Zhu Gechao punched. His fists were surrounded by swirling gray qi and transformed into a series of gray symbols, which merged into his fist.

“Go…”, Luotian’s eyes flashed with intense light. He punched, and the thunder of both collided.

“Crack…” Thunderbolts erupted from their collision. The invisible waves spread outward.

In the next moment, Luotian took a step back while Zhu Gechao's body was forcefully sent flying backward. He spat blood, his eyes filled with disbelief.
