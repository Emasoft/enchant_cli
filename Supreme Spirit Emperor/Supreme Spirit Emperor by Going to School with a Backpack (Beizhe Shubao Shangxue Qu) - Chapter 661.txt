On the other side, Luo Tian stood amidst flames, his vital energy surging. Each inscription etched upon him elevated his aura by a measure. The technique he wielded was the Soul-Devouring Body. With his cultivation at the middle stage of Immortal King, unleashing this technique yielded terrifying power; otherwise, with his current strength, he would have no chance against eight elders of the Eternal Life Hall.

Boom... Boom... The sound of explosions echoed within Luo Tian's body, as if a primordial beast was awakening within him.

"His aura is growing stronger; we must stop him, or it might become troublesome!" Chen Tianqi and others cried out. Particularly the middle-stage Immortal Kings felt a heart-stirring tremor from Luo Tian, sensing an immense crisis.

Several formidable figures began to exert themselves, annihilating the overwhelming flames. Divine laws flowed as, within a few heartbeats, several martial techniques struck into the towering flames.

"Too powerful! Are the elders of Eternal Life so formidable?" The disciples of Eternal Life Mountain cried, their eyes alight with exhilaration. Meanwhile, the Heaven-World Net had already been deployed, a verdant barrier enveloping the entire Eternal Life Mountain. This barrier was formed by over twenty million disciples of Eternal Life Mountain.

Boom... Finally, the multicolored flames vanished, and Luo Tian's figure appeared before the eight elders of Eternal Life Hall.

"Crush him immediately!" Without hesitation, upon seeing Luo Tian's emergence, the eight elders unleashed their techniques. Eight resounding martial arts thundered down upon him.

"World-Embracing Body!" Luo Tian roared, the heavens and earth trembled as his body expanded to a thousand zhang in height, transforming into a monstrous figure.

At the same time, Luo Tian's appearance returned to his original form, with the characters "Gui Gu" (Ghost Valley) on his back glowing radiantly.

The Splitting Heaven Spear roared forth, its demonic patterns flickering as it landed in Luo Tian's grasp. He raised the spear and clashed against the eight descending techniques.

Boom... Boom... Each technique was swept away by the Splitting Heaven Spear, yet Luo Tian's body was repeatedly pushed back. Finally, three late-stage Immortal King techniques caused him to spit blood.

"Think you can kill me? Have you prepared for how many souls to be sacrificed?" Luo Tian took a step forward, his legs marked with demonic patterns—this was the Seven Stomps of the Monster.

"Suicide, you dare!" One late-stage Immortal King leapt into the air, striking with a fist. It collided with Luo Tian's massive body, once again pushing him back.

"Kill..." The other seven also launched their attacks, striking Luo Tian repeatedly. Luo Tian took another step forward, completing the Soul-Devouring Body. His strength now rivaled that of a late-stage Immortal King, granting him the means to confront these adversaries.

Step one... Step two... The thunderous explosions continued as Luo Tian took six steps, each imbued with overwhelming power. The mountain peak trembled ceaselessly; had it not been for the disciples of Eternal Life Mountain's support, the mountain would have already crumbled under their collision.

Cough... Cough... Luo Tian's massive body was hurled backward, spitting blood profusely. The eight elders' attacks had inflicted considerable damage upon him.

"Buzz..." Yet Luo Tian remained fearless, sweeping his spear toward the eight elders.

"Eternal Life Tower!" One elder bellowed, and a verdant tower erupted from the void, expanding to crush Luo Tian—this was one of Eternal Life Mountain's three supreme divine artifacts.

"Crack..." Luo Tian clasped his hands above his head, holding the Splitting Heaven Spear aloft. With unparalleled flesh and bone, he resisted the Eternal Life Tower's suppression, causing his massive body to kneel.

"Break!" Luo Tian roared, standing upright once more. The Seventh Stomp of the Monster was unleashed, crashing toward the eight elders.

The thick foot carried overwhelming power and a formidable aura, causing the eight elders to frown in solemnity. Wind howled fiercely.

Ten Thousand Honored Ones... Luo Tian radiated an unparalleled aura, overpowering heaven and earth. His power reached its zenith, exploding with a resounding boom.

A piercing hum emanated from Luo Tian's feet, as demonic patterns danced along his thighs, amplifying the Seventh Stomp.

"What technique is this!" Chen Tianqi and five middle-stage Immortal Kings' faces contorted in shock, gazing at Luo Tian's overwhelming aura. They felt a life-threatening crisis under this stomp.

"Eternal Life Umbrella!" One late-stage Immortal King cried out, and a green jade umbrella unfurled, covering the sky and earth. Daoic inscriptions were etched upon its surface, expanding to envelop the eight elders.

At the moment the Eternal Life Umbrella unfurled, Luo Tian's foot met its sky-shrouding surface. A resounding boom erupted.

The waves surged, the void was torn apart, and Luo Tian's body shattered, his form hurled backward as he spat blood violently.

Luo Tian fell to the ground in a disheveled manner, then swiftly rose. He stepped into the Yellow Spring Steps, rushing toward the eight elders.

"Cough... Cough..." The five middle-stage Immortal Kings, after spitting blood, gazed in shock.

"Kill!" Three Immortal Kings advanced, one elder brandishing a long sword and striking toward Luo Tian.

Boom... Yet it only met a phantom of Luo Tian; in an instant, he appeared before the middle-stage Immortal King, thrusting his black spear.

"Damned!" The middle-stage Immortal King's face contorted in shock, seeing the sharp glint before him. He raised his sword to intercept.

"Crush..." The spear's tip met the sword, and the elder's face paled. He felt as if struck by a mountain, his body repeatedly recoiling.

"Boom..." Until he collided with the Eternal Life Hall's structure, halting his retreat. Yet the sword bore numerous cracks; the elder's eyes met Luo Tian's cold gaze.

"Die!" Luo Tian shouted, ignoring the attacks behind him and launching a punch. A black vortex formed at his fist, directly striking the elder's head, who was seemingly pinned to the Eternal Life Hall.

Seven overlapping punches struck the elder's head, shattering it like a burst watermelon, blood splattered upon the Eternal Life Hall. Sevenfold flesh and bone strength combined with Ten Thousand Honored Ones had unleashed his body's peak.

"Boom..." A heavy sound echoed as Luo Tian's fist struck the Eternal Life Hall. The disciples of Eternal Life Mountain, witnessing the elder's demise, trembled in fear. To kill a middle-stage Immortal King with one punch—what terrifying flesh and bone strength!

Demon energy surged, the sound of cracking echoed from Luo Tian's body. A black demonic armor enveloped him, forming a supreme demon god's silhouette. He struck toward the seven figures advancing again.

Another resounding boom echoed, and the black demon shadow disintegrated, with pieces of demonic armor crumbling before Luo Tian. His body pressed against the hall's structure, cracks and demon energy spewing forth as blood continuously fell.

Chapter 2477: I Will Cover the Rear()

This attack nearly shattered Luo Tian. Even his flesh and bone could not withstand it. Though he now rivaled a late-stage Immortal King, he was still not one.

"Reincarnation Realm!" Luo Tian roared, and the Reincarnation Realm instantly opened. A four-thousand-zhang domain expanded, sucking in all surrounding spiritual energy within a four-thousand-zhang radius.

The opening of the Reincarnation Realm caused their forms to slightly pause, eyes filled with surprise. However, seven of them expanded their domains, and Luo Tian's domain was instantly shattered. A series of gray spiritual souls vanished into the void.

"Kill again!" Luo Tian caught his breath, his form flickering as he transformed into a streak of light, vanishing from the spot.

"Shatter his speed! We can now track his movement!" The seven cried out, one elder slashing a blade toward the direction Luo Tian had taken.

"Crack..." Thunder roared again as black spear clashed against the sky-piercing blade, shattering before Luo Tian. His body paused, then rushed toward them with even greater speed!

"Chen Tianqi, your life is mine!" Luo Tian roared, his voice piercing the clouds. Chen Tianqi's body shuddered.

To be human is to fear death, especially for Eternal Life Mountain disciples who feared it more than anyone—after all, their path was immortality. Yet Luo Tian's roar had drawn their attention. However, instead of targeting Chen Tianqi, Luo Tian set his sights on another middle-stage Immortal King.

Luo Tian appeared like a ghost before the elder, launching a punch. Another overwhelming punch, a full-force strike that left the middle-stage Immortal King pale and raising his hand to intercept.

Yet this time, they were prepared. Especially the three late-stage Immortal Kings were not idle. Luo Tian's speed was fast, but the elder's was no less so. The elder vanished like teleportation, appearing before the middle-stage Immortal King and striking a punch.

"Crack..." Luo Tian took two steps back, spitting blood profusely. The elder's lips bled but his face bore a mocking smile, gazing at Luo Tian with contempt.

"From now on, you cannot kill any of us from Eternal Life Mountain!" The elder spoke, and space trembled. He vanished into the void.

The elder materialized before Luo Tian's face, extending a hand to grasp an invisible blade that sliced toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly, his hands moving swiftly as the Black Hell Ghost Claws roared forth. A black beast lunged toward the invisible blade.

"Boom..."

The ghost claws were severed by the invisible blade, blocking the elder's attack. Yet Luo Tian was struck again, his body hurled backward, collapsing into a hollowed back.

Luo Tian slowly rose, swallowing a pill that instantly healed his wounds. Transmigration Pill, given to him by an elder who had prepared the elixir when he left the Ancient Court. No matter how severe the injury, it could instantly recover once.

"What is this thing?" They were astonished, watching Luo Tian rise again, full of vigor.

"Transmutation Stone! Can you come out already? I'm barely holding on!" As Luo Tian just recovered, the battle in the void had reached its critical moment.

Long Que had been injured and hadn't recovered yet. Initially, the Eternal Life Immortals had cautiously tested him, wary of Long Que. But after some time in battle, they gradually discerned Long Que's strength.

"Boom..." A sea of fire engulfed the area, a dragon of flame expelled by Long Que. Yet it was shattered by an Eternal Life Immortal's palm strike.

"Unexpectedly, the former Emperor has reached this point!" The Eternal Life Immortal laughed, gazing at Long Que.

"Kid, if you push me too far, I'll annihilate your Eternal Life Mountain even if it takes a thousand years of slumber!" Long Que roared, restrained by the Eternal Life Immortal. His fury surged, planning to unleash his innate technique.

Yet this "kid" remark left people speechless. However, it was the truth—Long Que was a world beast, an ancient power of the divine realm. The Eternal Life Immortal was a peak strength from the ancient times, and their differences were vast.

"My words still hold: submit to me, and I'll lead you into Eternal Life!" The Eternal Life Immortal spoke, continuing his attacks.

"You dare to speak of eternal life? You're far from it!" Long Que fought desperately, spitting out a fire sword from his mouth. It sped toward the Eternal Life Immortal.

"Then I'll have to subdue you!" The Eternal Life Immortal roared, his hands moving swiftly. The void trembled as a heavy aura descended upon them.

A green door materialized out of nowhere, its overwhelming presence causing everyone's hearts to tremble. Even Luo Tian and his group were affected.

"World Treasure, imbued with world power!" Long Que's eyes finally showed concern as the green door clashed against his crimson sword.

Crack... Like the heavens and earth collapsing, a thunderous roar echoed over Eternal Life Mountain. All disciples of Eternal Life Mountain spat blood, and even the barrier formed by their combined strength trembled.

"World Treasure, Eternal Life Gate!" Luo Tian took a breath, gazing at the green door.

Eternal Life Gate was Eternal Life Mountain's ultimate treasure. This technique had been cultivated by the disciples of Eternal Life Mountain from the Eternal Life Gate.

Blood flowed from Long Que's mouth. That crimson fire sword was his innate weapon, comparable to a world treasure. However, it had also been damaged in a previous battle against his old adversary.

"Damned!" Long Que spat out another fire lotus, a destructive wave that crashed toward the green door. At the same time, a fiery hand seized his crimson sword and swung it repeatedly against the Eternal Life Gate.

"During the ancient times, what did you endure? Why are you so weak now?" The Eternal Life Immortal continued to summon the Eternal Life Gate, clashing with Long Que. They moved at times slowly and at others swiftly, as if time and space could not contain them.

"Time Blade, a century lost!" The Eternal Life Immortal roared, his hands moving swiftly. Long Que's space twisted instantly, and a series of light blades emerged, slicing toward him.

"Time-formed technique! You're nearly at the half-step Emperor of Heaven!" Peacock's wings flapped, and invisible blades emerged, countering the Eternal Life Immortal's time blade.

Luo Tian was no better off; his spear continuously moved, clashing in close combat with them or resisting long-range techniques. Yet truly, as the elder had said, he hadn't killed anyone but was constantly battered by seven opponents, darting everywhere.

"Dragon's Abyss!" Luo Tian roared, and the Dragon's Abyss Sword appeared in his hand. He slashed it against a technique, while the Splitting Heaven Spear clashed with another sword.

Luo Tian's body was hurled backward, colliding again against the Eternal Life Hall's wall. He felt his bones were about to shatter.

"Ah! I'm out!" As Luo Tian collided with the hall, a voice echoed in both his and Long Que's minds.

"Transmutation Stone!" Both Luo Tian and Long Que trembled, their eyes filled with joy.

"Transmutation Stone? I didn't expect an unexpected gain; another ancient treasure!" The Eternal Life Immortal's eyes flashed like lightning, his gaze sweeping toward the Eternal Life Hall.

"Dead man walking! They found us; it's easier to be discovered!" Transmutation Stone cursed, a red light flying toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian extended his hand, and a phantom soul emerged from it, instantly captured by Transmutation Stone—this was Zhang Daotian's soul.

"Transmutation Stone, you betrayed us!" Chen Tianqi raged, raising a blade to strike Luo Tian.

"Kid, take care of yourself; I can't help you anymore!" Transmutation Stone spoke to Luo Tian before vanishing from his body.

"Enough!" Luo Tian's face finally showed a smile. He could feel Zhang Daotian's soul had merged and regained consciousness.

"What good is it to have Zhang Daotian's soul? You can't escape!" The Eternal Life Immortal smiled, watching Luo Tian clash again with the elders of Eternal Life Hall.

"Sky Dao Mountain!" Upon hearing the Eternal Life Immortal's words, the disciples of Eternal Life Mountain were stunned. Their eyes held disbelief as they gazed at Luo Tian.

"Only now do I understand why the Eternal Life Immortal wanted to kill him. Even if he wasn't a disciple of Ghost Valley, he had to be killed. Now that it's come to this, what will become of him in the future?" The disciples of Eternal Life Mountain erupted.

"Transmutation Stone, where are you running!" One late-stage Immortal King chased after Transmutation Stone.

"Your mother! I'm running recklessly, what can you do!" Transmutation Stone cursed, evading the elder's attacks.

"Luo Tian kid, what do you plan to do? Keep running like this, can your master and friends endure it?" Transmutation Stone shouted.

"Buzz..." As Transmutation Stone's words ended, waves of energy spread from the Eternal Life Hall. The elders of Eternal Life Mountain slightly changed their expressions.

"The Eternal Life Flower has issues!" One late-stage Immortal King spoke, gazing at the Eternal Life Hall.

"Go check it out; we two will stay behind. Your presence or absence doesn't matter!" The late-stage Immortal King ordered Chen Tianqi and the middle-stage Immortals.

"Good!" Chen Tianqi and others flew into the Eternal Life Hall. The Eternal Life Flower was crucial, and it couldn't be ignored.

Though the middle-stage Immortals were gone, Luo Tian's pressure lessened slightly but he was still restrained by two.

"Continuing like this, none of us can escape!" Luo Tian thought, his eyes showing ferocity.

"Master Long Que, take Transmutation Stone and go first; I'll cover your rear!" Luo Tian's voice carried madness, surprising everyone.

Chapter 2479: Arrival()

Supreme power clashed—one side was a peak-stage Immortal King's world treasure, the other an unknown-grade epoch book.

Three late-stage Immortals felt a life-threatening crisis, even they trembled under these attacks.

"Eternal Life Tower, Eternal Life Umbrella, Eternal Life Hall!" The three late-stage Immortals cried out, activating their supreme divine artifacts to counter the overwhelming power.

Boom... Boom... The earth-shattering waves spread instantly, sending fragments of stone flying in all directions. The disciples of Eternal Life Mountain felt their heads throb, struck by an invisible wave and dying in large numbers.

When people opened their eyes again, they were stunned, gazing at the vast void. The entire mountain peak of Eternal Life Hall had vanished; chaotic currents flowed endlessly, a figure standing there with numerous cracks and weakened aura.

"Crack..." The green umbrella's surface shattered, leaving only its skeleton. The Eternal Life Tower was also riddled with cracks.

"What happened? Just now?"

"Two supreme divine artifacts were damaged!" The disciples of Eternal Life Mountain exclaimed, their eyes filled with shock.

"How is this possible? Those are supreme divine artifacts! We only have three of them!"

"Not just that, the three late-stage Immortals also suffered heavy injuries!" People erupted in chaos, gazing at Luo Tian, who was barely alive. They felt the terrifying power of Luo Tian.

"Blood... The Eternal Life Immortal also bled!" They saw the Eternal Life Immortal with blood trickling from his lips.

The Eternal Life Immortal was a figure of faith for Eternal Life Mountain, undefeated and conquering the Daoist Mountain. He had defeated Eternal Life Mountain and made it subtly the top of the nine immortal mountains. Though he had been injured in his battle with Long Que, now Luo Tian had also wounded the Eternal Life Immortal.

"Finished..." Luo Tian's face showed a slight smile, gazing at the Eternal Life Immortal who had just reactivated the Eternal Life Gate.

At this moment, Luo Tian's injuries were severe; he didn't need anyone to attack him. If he didn't recover promptly, he would die himself.

"You are the first in the world to have done this to my Eternal Life Mountain!" The Eternal Life Immortal wiped his lips, eyes brighter.

"I'll send you to your death. Don't worry; I'll find your master and kill him too!" The Eternal Life Immortal spoke softly, reactivating the Eternal Life Gate.

"Didn't I come too late, kid!" Just as the overwhelming Eternal Life Gate descended, a voice echoed from the void. A streak of light landed on Luo Tian's body.

"Buzz..." Waves of energy spread again from Luo Tian, golden sunlight rising once more—this was the Epoch Book returning to his consciousness.

The golden Epoch Book flipped its pages, and upon reaching the seventh page, a terrifying wave of energy caused the Eternal Life Immortal's face to change.

Boom... Another resounding collision, the heavens hadn't recovered yet but were shattered again. The earth-shaking boom spread outward.

Boom... Boom... More disciples of Eternal Life Mountain were swept away by an invisible wave, turning into blood mist and scattering in the world.

The world fell into a brief calm; the explosion had swept for dozens of heartbeats before finally calming.

"Cough... Cough..." A loud cough echoed through the world, but the disciples of Eternal Life Mountain didn't hear it. Their heads felt like they would explode.

Three late-stage Immortal Kings of Eternal Life Mountain gazed in fear, their front occupied by the Eternal Life Immortal standing there, spitting blood. Their heads had a world treasure, the Eternal Life Gate, hovering above them.

"Who are you?" The Eternal Life Immortal spoke solemnly, gazing at the figure in gray robes standing nearby.

An old figure, yet his body was straight. His presence radiated an overwhelming aura. Though he was a late-stage Immortal King, his invincible aura made the Eternal Life Immortal wary.

The old man wiped his lips, gazing at the Eternal Life Immortal. Behind him stood Luo Tian, bowing.

"Master Jun, why have you come?" Luo Tian was puzzled, recognizing the figure before him. It was none other than Jun Wulei, the second Epoch Master of the Nine Regions and a powerful figure from the Ancient Court!

"I wanted to take a walk. Your older brother entered the Ancient Court, so I came out. The others were managing the array; otherwise, it would have been safer for them to come out!" Jun Wulei replied, gazing at the Eternal Life Immortal.

"Jun Wulei!" Jun Wulei spoke softly, his gaze meeting the Eternal Life Immortal's. His aura was no less than the latter's.

"I've never heard of you!" The Eternal Life Immortal spoke solemnly, surprised by the sudden appearance of a powerful figure. He felt a threat from Jun Wulei.

Though Jun Wulei appeared as a late-stage Immortal King, for some reason, the Eternal Life Immortal felt threatened. Though not as much as Long Que, he had clashed twice with the Epoch Book and the Eternal Life Gate. He was now in a weakened state after protecting three late-stage Immortals.

"If you were at your peak, I wouldn't be your match. But now, I still can!" Jun Wulei didn't waste words; he had come to help Luo Tian from the Ancient Court. His hands flashed with divine light, and a golden sword appeared in his grasp.

"Kid, can you still move?" Jun Wulei asked Luo Tian, knowing he could only hold them off. Escape depended on Luo Tian himself.

"Reincarnation!" Luo Tian roared, unleashing a punch of Reincarnation. A vast channel of reincarnation appeared in the void, causing people's eyes to widen with fear.

"Crack..." The next moment, a piece of the reincarnation channel shattered. Luo Tian rushed toward it.

Luo Tian knew his state—despite three late-stage Immortals, even a middle-stage Immortal could block him. Thus, he thought of this method: entering the reincarnation channel. No matter what, as long as his soul was safe, he could be reborn in the underworld.

"Good kid!" Jun Wulei's eyes flashed with admiration, and he swung his sword toward the Eternal Life Immortal.

The Eternal Life Immortal roared, and a long sword appeared in his hand, clashing with the sword's light. Thunderous sounds echoed through the world.

"Stop that kid! If he escapes, you'll be held accountable! Also, the middle-stage Immortals are weak now!" The Eternal Life Immortal shouted at the three late-stage Immortals and the middle-stage Immortals of Eternal Life Mountain.

"The middle-stage Immortals will handle it themselves!" Jun Wulei transmitted to Luo Tian, his sword's light expanding.

"Pu..." Blood instantly appeared; three late-stage Immortals chasing Luo Tian were stopped by Jun Wulei.

The collision sounds returned, and Jun Wulei fought four opponents alone, holding them back with an overwhelming aura.

Before Luo Tian were several middle-stage Immortals blocking his path, standing before the vast reincarnation channel.

"Luo Tian!" They didn't dare to attack immediately, as Luo Tian had previously instilled fear in them. They knew that if they blocked Luo Tian, the Eternal Life Immortal would eventually win.

"Move aside!" Luo Tian's strength was exhausted, his flesh and bone weakened, but he radiated a fierce determination. His Splitting Heaven Spear appeared in his hand as he gazed at the middle-stage Immortals, most of whom he had met before—Zhang Yuting and Lu Tianji were among them.

"Kill..." Luo Tian knew there was no sentimentality; he stepped into the void and struck a middle-stage Immortal.

"Pu..." A spear pierced through the throat of a middle-stage Immortal, and Luo Tian appeared before him, bloodied. The Splitting Heaven Spear had pierced the elder's throat.

"He's out of strength; it's all thanks to that spear, a supreme divine artifact!" People instantly noticed Luo Tian's trembling arms. Some parts of his arm even revealed bone.

"Suicide..." Luo Tian coldly uttered the two words, standing there with an overwhelming gaze at Zhang Yuting and others. The hesitant figures instantly froze.

Severely wounded, he had intimidated numerous middle-stage Immortals. Such a demeanor was admirable even among enemies of Eternal Life Mountain.

Luo Tian took another step forward toward the reincarnation channel, but Zhang Yuting's face contorted in fear and he blocked again.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian took a step forward, his form vanished, but he smiled. The Splitting Heaven Spear struck again, and another middle-stage Immortal died at Luo Tian's hands.

"Master Jie Tian, you go first; I can't escape!" Luo Tian transmitted to Master Jie Tian, his body trembling. He knew he was at the end of his strength; killing two had already been his limit. He no longer had the strength to wield the Splitting Heaven Spear.

"Kid, are you giving up?" Master Jie Tian shouted loudly, his divine power overwhelming.

"You're strong; even if I was at my best, defeating you would be difficult. But you forgot where we are—this is Eternal Life Mountain; I have a world treasure, but you don't!"

"Eternal Life Gate!" The Eternal Life Immortal shouted, reactivating the Eternal Life Gate. A powerful aura radiated from it, causing Jun Wulei's face to slightly change.

"World treasure! You don't know about the Ancient Court!" Jun Wulei roared, his body floating. His hands moved swiftly, and the void trembled. Next moment, a golden ring appeared in his hand, which he hurled toward the Eternal Life Gate.

"How is this possible? The Ancient Court still exists?" The Eternal Life Immortal's face slightly changed upon seeing the golden ring, as he felt a similar aura to that of the Eternal Life Gate.

"Buzz..." The ring spun rapidly, colliding toward the Eternal Life Gate. A resounding boom echoed as two world treasures collided, flying apart in opposite directions into the void.

Chapter 2480: Collapse()

The battle unfolded, Jun Wulei single-handedly holding off four opponents. His unparalleled talent left the Eternal Life Immortal in awe. The three late-stage Immortals were also extremely shocked, their combined strength could barely withstand Jun Wulei's attacks.

"We may have suffered heavy injuries, but we're not this pitiful!"

"He would be unmatched in the immortal world if he reached peak Immortal King!" The three late-stage Immortals continuously fought, only defending themselves. They were curious about where this monster had come from.

Boom...

The ring and the Eternal Life Gate collided, flying into the void without a trace. Meanwhile, Jun Wulei fought against the Eternal Life Immortal while also suppressing three others.

"Stop gawking and kill that kid!" The Eternal Life Immortal shouted, now the most vulnerable moment for Eternal Life Mountain.

"Kill..." Upon hearing the Eternal Life Immortal's words, Zhang Yuting and others dared not disobey. They shouted and rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Soul-Devouring Body!" Luo Tian roared, his eyes filled with madness. His aura radiated destruction.

The Soul-Devouring Body, which Luo Tian had previously maintained control over, was now unleashed to its fullest. He would use his body for this final strike.

Boom... Luo Tian's body emitted a resounding aura, with a crackling sound echoing from it. A terrifying aura made Zhang Yuting and others pale in fear, their bodies trembling under this power.

"Run!" Almost immediately after Luo Tian unleashed the Soul-Devouring Body, Zhang Yuting and others had only one thought.

"Let my demon body destroy all paths!" A cold voice echoed in their ears, a destructive aura radiating from Luo Tian.

In an instant, Luo Tian's body shattered, his cultivation and flesh all transformed into a terrifying attack. It erupted with a resounding boom.

A thunderous explosion echoed through the world... The entire Eternal Life Mountain fell silent, only this resounding echo remaining. It even overshadowed Jun Wulei's battle with the others.

The power swept across, a terrifying wave spreading outward from where Luo Tian had stood.

Furious waves turned into nothingness, striking the fleeing Zhang Yuting and others. Pu... Pu... Pu...

Blood mist rose; several middle-stage Immortals were instantly turned into blood mist, vanishing completely.

Yet the destruction of several middle-stage Immortals was not over. The furious waves swept toward the Eternal Life Immortal's battlefield. Three late-stage Immortals' faces contorted in fear; their current state was extremely poor, and this wave terrified them.

"Eternal Life Gate!" The Eternal Life Immortal shouted, a green door flying from the void and standing before the four of them.

"This kid!" Jun Wulei's face contorted in shock, summoning a golden ring back. Divine light enveloped Jun Wulei.

Wind howled fiercely, and the furious waves collided with the green door, causing the Eternal Life Immortal's face to darken.

"Is this a self-destruction?" The disciples of Eternal Life Mountain watched the vanished Luo Tian, their eyes filled with fear.

The storm calmed; the entire Eternal Life Mountain was in ruins. The Eternal Life Immortal and three late-stage Immortals appeared, gazing at the direction of Luo Tian.

"Where is the Epoch Book?" The Eternal Life Immortal gazed at the direction of Luo Tian's disappearance but found no trace of the Epoch Book.

A wisp of gray energy slowly rose, a ghostly figure with迷茫 (confusion) gazing toward the approaching reincarnation channel.

Residual soul! The Eternal Life Immortal exclaimed, taking a step toward the gray residual soul. However, a golden divine light blocked his path.

"Move aside!" The Eternal Life Immortal roared, striking with a palm. It collided with the divine light but caused his body to retreat two steps.

"Buzz..." As the Eternal Life Immortal was pushed back, the ghostly soul finally entered the reincarnation channel.

"Live on!" Jun Wulei shouted, his sword sweeping and striking the three late-stage Immortals. Pu... Pu... Pu...

Three blood lights rose, and one of the late-stage Immortals was severed at the waist. His body fell in two pieces onto the ground.

"Damned!" The Eternal Life Immortal roared, his hands moving swiftly. Divine laws flowed as invisible waves fell upon the two pieces of the body.

Invisible power seemed to have a gathering force, and a gray soul appeared—this was the soul of the elder who had been severed.

"Kill that kid!" The Eternal Life Immortal shouted at the soul of the late-stage Immortal, raising his hand to strike. The gray soul transformed into a streak of light and rushed into the reincarnation channel as well.

"He's gone!" Jun Wulei's eyes showed regret, and he flew upward, rushing out of Eternal Life Mountain. He didn't know what state Luo Tian was in and had no reason to stay.

The Eternal Life Immortal's face darkened, watching Jun Wulei leave. He knew he couldn't hold him back; after all, his current state was poor, and Long Que's fire had yet to be fully dispelled but was still suppressed.

As Jun Wulei left, several figures appeared outside Eternal Life Mountain—others at the peak of Immortal King.

"What happened in Eternal Life?" Gui Wang asked, gazing at the ruined Eternal Life Mountain.

The massive commotion of Eternal Life Mountain could not escape the notice of several peak Immortals. Upon receiving news, they had rushed over and arrived just in time for the end of the battle.

"The disciple of Ghost Valley has appeared; a residual soul entered the reincarnation channel!" The Eternal Life Immortal spoke, his face dark with anger.

Luo Tian and Jun Wulei, along with Long Que, had left Eternal Life Mountain in such a state. Hundreds of thousands of disciples were dead; six middle-stage Immortals had fallen, and one late-stage Immortal had been lost. This was a major setback for Eternal Life Mountain.

"What!" Upon hearing the Eternal Life Immortal's words, the faces of the peak Immortals changed instantly. They could clearly sense the intensity of this battle.

"Thankfully, it's resolved; otherwise, it would have been a major threat to the nine immortal mountains. Eternal Life, you've suffered greatly this time!" One elder spoke, his voice filled with amusement.

"Old bastard!" The Eternal Life Immortal cursed inwardly, feeling these people had arrived long ago but wanted to see Eternal Life Mountain weakened. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been so convenient for them. A simple "suffered greatly" had dismissed him.
