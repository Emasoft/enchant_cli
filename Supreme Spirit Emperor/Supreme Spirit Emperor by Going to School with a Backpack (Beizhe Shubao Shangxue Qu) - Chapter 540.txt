Zhang Menlie was not foolish. If he had let Chen Tiansheng go, Chen Tiansheng would have certainly not spared him. Moreover, the family had already disillusioned him; merely one sentence from Chen Tiansheng was enough to abandon him and even pursue him. A family like this, it was better not to return!

Moreover, if he defected now, this demon would certainly not let him live. Through the relentless pursuit, Zhang Menlie had come to understand that this demon was a man of vengeance.

He had not even revealed his killing intent, merely intending to rob and plunder a little, yet this man had chased him across ten thousand miles.

“Wummm…” A barrier rose before Chen Tiansheng, and Zhang Menlie’s sword struck the barrier.

The black barrier shattered instantly, but the sword still pierced Chen Tiansheng’s chest, though its power was greatly diminished. A spray of blood bloomed on Chen Tiansheng’s chest.

“I’ll see how many life-saving tricks you have left!” Zhang Menlie roared, slashing again.

At the same time, Liu Cheng’s figure surged toward Luo Tian, transforming into a swirling black mist that coalesced into a massive black maw. With a single inhale, the void twisted, and an immense suction force erupted from the maw.

“Crash…!” A whirlwind burst forth from Luo Tian’s surroundings, sending fragments of stone flying toward the black maw.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian’s expression flickered slightly, his gaze locking onto the black maw that was Liu Cheng.

“Soul-Feeding Demon’s innate power—Devouring Qi!” Zhang Menlie halted his movements, gazing at the black maw in the sky with a grave expression.

As the suction force spread, Luo Tian felt his newly formed Immortal Spirit energy waver slightly, as if it threatened to burst from his body.

The轮回天功 (Reincarnation Heaven Art) surged, and Luo Tian attempted to suppress his Immortal Spirit energy, but it was futile.

Black qi seeped from both Zhang Menlie and Luo Tian’s bodies, precisely their Immortal Spirit energy.

“Master, it won’t work! If we continue like this, our Immortal Spirit energy will be devoured!” Zhang Menlie spoke, his voice laced with alarm.

“This ghostly creature is useful; I have some use for it!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with a hint of amusement. He extended his hand, and a black light shot forth from it.

The dark light expanded. Upon closer inspection, one could discern it was an imprint—this mark came from the Soul-Feeding Seal.

In a blink, the imprint was sucked into the black maw. Luo Tian pressed his palm, and waves of energy radiated from it.

“Ah…” As the energy surged, the black maw abruptly ceased its consumption and reverted to Liu Cheng’s form. However, Liu Cheng’s eyes brimmed with intense fear, and his body trembled involuntarily before flying to Luo Tian’s side.

“Hail the Master!” Liu Cheng’s face gradually shifted from fear to reverence as he addressed Luo Tian, his gaze fixed on him.

“Retreat,” Luo Tian nodded, uninterested, and gestured for Zhang Menlie to continue.

“How is this possible!” Zhang Menlie and Chen Tiansheng stared at Luo Tian, their voices hoarse with disbelief. Even Liu Cheng’s daughter gaped in shock.

“What technique is this!” Zhang Menlie and Chen Tiansheng were instantly disoriented; Luo Tian’s move had effortlessly subdued a former Immortal Spirit Mid-Stage Soul-Feeding Demon.

This effortless display exceeded their comprehension. Especially Zhang Menlie, who was himself a Soul-Feeding Master, felt awestruck by Luo Tian’s prowess. He realized instantly that his decision to follow Luo Tian was absolutely correct.

“This technique can only be wielded by a Soul-Feeding Master of the Earth Grade; this man is definitely an Earth Grade Soul-Feeding Master!” Zhang Menlie’s eyes gleamed with excitement as he gazed at Luo Tian.

With no further obstacles, Zhang Menlie’s eyes darkened with cruelty again. His black sword flared once more and slashed toward Chen Tiansheng.

Previously, Zhang Menlie had harbored some resentment toward Luo Tian, but now he was utterly subdued. An Earth Grade Soul-Feeding Master was a figure of immense value, sought after by every clan. Such an individual represented an army of Immortal Spirit Early Stage ghosts.

“Crash…” Just as the black sword was about to strike Chen Tiansheng, Luo Tian extended his hand and halted it.

“Enough,” Luo Tian murmured, then pointed a finger. Black patterns flickered as he unleashed the Dao-Seed Demon Art. Simultaneously, Luo Tian cast layer upon layer of restrictions, sealing Chen Tiansheng and storing him in his storage pouch.

“Testing me,” Zhang Menlie instantly understood Luo Tian’s intent, but he was puzzled—why would this Earth Grade Soul-Feeding Master act thus?

“Alright, tidy up Black Cloud City,” Luo Tian spoke softly, pointing at Zhang Menlie. “I heard you’re a Soul-Feeding Master?”

“Indeed, Master,” Zhang Menlie’s eyes sparkled with excitement. “I am a Soul-Feeding Master. Though I dare not compare myself to the Master, among our clan’s younger generation, my Soul-Feeding skills are undoubtedly the best!”

“Honesty, I’ve successfully cultivated two Immortal Spirit Early Stage ghosts,” Zhang Menlie continued.

“Unfortunately, those two Immortal Spirit Early Stage ghosts were all destroyed by a bastard in the Yama Palace,” Zhang Menlie gritted his teeth, his face contorted with resentment.

“Hmph.” Luo Tian nodded, recalling the two ghosts Zhang Menlie had summoned in Hell.

“Master, let us go to our city lord’s mansion for a while,” Liu Cheng said respectfully, his eyes now viewing Luo Tian as a godlike figure.

“Very well,” Luo Tian nodded, not refusing. He indeed had questions for Zhang Menlie.

“Zhang Menlie, I wish to know—how does one cultivate ghosts?” Luo Tian asked, gazing at Zhang Menlie.

“Huh…” Zhang Menlie was momentarily stunned. He had expected Luo Tian to formally accept him as a disciple, but instead, the latter posed this question.

This was an elementary question for any Soul-Feeding Master—basic knowledge.

“Testing me, he must be testing me!” Zhang Menlie speculated, quickly deducing Luo Tian’s intent. His heart raced; this was his specialty—cultivating ghosts.

“Master, though cultivating ghosts is the simplest step, it can also be the most difficult. Everyone knows that to cultivate ghosts, one must have a ghost seed and fire…” Zhang Menlie spoke at length, recounting all he knew.

Chapter 2068: Initiation ()

In the opulent hall of Black Cloud City, the chamber was dim but devoid of the coldness outside.

Luo Tian stood in the hall, his face solemn. He extended a hand, and a drop of black blood hovered above his palm.

This blood came from Liu Cheng. The drop of blood the Ghost King had given Luo Tian remained unused; in Black Cloud City, he had stayed for five days, and the city had restored its former state.

During these five days, Luo Tian repeatedly attempted to cultivate ghosts but failed multiple times, causing chaos in the city lord’s mansion.

These five days had seen countless explosions; his progress was considerable, and he gradually discerned a difference between Liu Cheng’s blood and the Ghost King’s.

The Ghost King’s drop of blood carried an indistinct aura of authority, whereas Liu Cheng’s lacked it.

“Seems that Ghost King isn’t simple,” Luo Tian mused, then resumed his cultivation.

“Is he truly an Earth Grade Soul-Feeding Master?” Zhang Menlie stood respectfully outside Luo Tian’s courtyard, his eyes filled with doubt.

For five days, Zhang Menlie had remained there, observing Luo Tian’s ghost cultivation. Yet even he, who could effortlessly cultivate ghosts, found Luo Tian had never succeeded.

“He didn’t know how to cultivate ghosts before… that’s why he asked me,” Zhang Menlie realized Luo Tian’s intent, but his heart sank.

An Earth Grade Soul-Feeding Master was worth following, yet Zhang Menlie felt some resentment. After all, Luo Tian’s strength alone was not enough to convince him.

These days, Luo Tian had incessantly questioned Zhang Menlie about Soul-Feeding matters, which made Zhang Menlie increasingly agitated.

But now, he was at Luo Tian’s mercy—his body bound by restrictions. He had initially proposed to follow Luo Tian as a temporary measure, for only Luo Tian could have saved him.

But saving him then didn’t guarantee he would be safe later. After all, the Zhang clan’s power was substantial, and Chen Tiansheng remained an unstable factor. If the Chen clan discovered this, even Luo Tian might not withstand their fury.

“Find an opportunity to escape,” Zhang Menlie thought at that moment.

Another figure stood there, his expression equally bitter. This was Liu Cheng, bound by the Soul-Feeding Seal. He regarded Luo Tian with a sense of awe.

Yet Liu Cheng was an Immortal Spirit Mid-Stage cultivator; after recovering, the Soul-Feeding Seal’s constraints had lessened. However, Liu Cheng knew this while Luo Tian did not.

These days, Luo Tian had repeatedly taken his blood, leaving Liu Cheng weak and exhausted. Ghostly blood was not like human blood; it was extremely difficult to condense.

Liu Cheng feared that if Luo Tian continued this way, he would be drained to death. At this moment, Liu Cheng’s face was gaunt, his eyes filled with sorrow as he stood there.

“Feeling hollowed out…” Liu Cheng sighed deeply, gazing at Luo Tian’s courtyard. He stood alongside Zhang Menlie outside the courtyard.

Occasionally, they exchanged glances and felt a shared sense of sorrow, but neither spoke; they didn’t trust each other.

“Wummm…” As the two stood bitter, waves of energy suddenly emanated from Luo Tian’s room.

“Another explosion! Run!” The two instinctively vanished from the courtyard, fleeing to a safe distance before halting. They watched Luo Tian’s courtyard cautiously.

“What happened?” The two exchanged glances, following their usual pattern—this time was an explosion.

“Roar…” A roar echoed from Luo Tian’s room, accompanied by a pressure that descended upon the two.

“This…” Zhang Menlie and Liu Cheng’s expressions flickered slightly; Liu Cheng felt a pressure several times stronger than Zhang Menlie’s.

“This pressure… it feels like a ghost,” Zhang Menlie mused, his eyes filled with confusion.

“Could he have succeeded?” He seemed to realize something and whispered.

“It’s impossible; it’s only been five days! He couldn’t have succeeded so quickly! Even our clan’s ancestor took nearly a month to learn how to cultivate ghosts!” Zhang Menlie dismissed the thought.

“Crash…” The door was blasted open by black energy, and Zhang Menlie’s heart eased.

“Surely another explosion!” Zhang Menlie sneered, thinking Luo Tian was being overly optimistic. Soul-Feeding Masters weren’t easy to become.

A massive black entity emerged from the room, instantly darkening Zhang Menlie’s face and causing his body to tremble involuntarily.

“This…?” Zhang Menlie wanted to flee, but upon realizing the entity was only of the Dao-Realm grade, his heart slightly calmed.

A towering figure, smooth all over, with four thin arms instead of hands—each arm ended in a blade-like appendage. Its empty eyes and massive mouth, lined with dagger-like teeth.

“Tianxi Lie Ghost Beast!” Liu Cheng’s face showed disbelief, his gaze fixed on the massive form. He instinctively trembled.

This ghost beast was the Tianxi Lie Ghost Beast, which is why Zhang Menlie wanted to flee. He had been relentlessly chased by this beast before, leaving him with deep trauma.

“Roar…” The roar echoed as the Tianxi Lie Ghost Beast saw Zhang Menlie and Liu Cheng, instinctively rushing toward them.

“Return!” A commanding voice rang out, and the Tianxi Lie Ghost Beast instantly halted, its face filled with submission. It turned to gaze at the figure emerging from the room.

Luo Tian, clad in black robes, his face weary but eyes gleaming with joy. He gazed at the towering figure, surprised he had cultivated the Tianxi Lie Ghost Beast. He knew its strength.

Though not a King Beast, if he continued to feed it, it would surely become a powerful ally.

Luo Tian waved his hand; though puzzled why he had cultivated the Tianxi Lie Ghost Beast, he knew that the type of ghost formed depended on the blood used. There was an 80% chance of forming a specific ghost, but there was still a slight probability of mutation—though it was minimal.

“My blood has cultivated a Tianxi Lie Ghost Beast?” Liu Cheng stared at the massive form, his eyes filled with disbelief.

Liu Cheng’s blood could cultivate a Tianxi Lie Ghost Beast, meaning he himself had greater potential.

“Don’t dream too much!” Luo Tian spoke softly, sensing Liu Cheng’s thoughts. He had cultivated the Tianxi Lie Ghost Beast using the Ghost King’s blood.

He also felt regret; if he had used the Ghost King’s blood to succeed immediately, he might have cultivated a higher-grade ghost.

“Xiaohēi!” Luo Tian quickly thought of the Three-Headed Dog, which came from Hell and fed on ghosts. Perhaps it could cultivate something remarkable.

Zhang Menlie was even more awestruck, gazing at Luo Tian with reverence. Luo Tian’s speed in learning to cultivate ghosts was astonishing—only five days, an achievement he had never seen before.

“Perhaps he’ll quickly become an Earth Grade Soul-Feeding Master!” Zhang Menlie mused, his eyes gleaming.

“Congratulations, Master! You’ve cultivated a Tianxi Lie Ghost Beast!” Zhang Menlie quickly praised, his eyes filled with fervor.

“Your Master’s talent is truly earth-shattering and ghost-terrifying! My admiration for you flows like an endless river…” Seeing Zhang Menlie’s flattery, Liu Cheng also spoke immediately, his words eloquent.

“Comparing flattery with me? I’ve never lost!” Liu Cheng’s eyes gleamed with pride.

“Enough, Zhang Menlie. Tell me how to feed ghosts next,” Luo Tian said after enjoying their flattery, addressing Zhang Menlie.

“Yes, Master!” Zhang Menlie looked at Liu Cheng with a sense of superiority. At this moment, he had another thought—that Luo Tian would quickly become an Earth Grade Soul-Feeding Master. Five days of cultivation—this speed gave him hope.

“Master, feeding ghosts is simple. It’s similar to cultivating ghosts but instead of refining them, you form a ghost pearl at the stage of condensing it. You use special imprints to allow the ghosts to absorb and refine it.”

“Unlike cultivating ghosts, ghost pearls don’t require a ghost’s blood to form.”

“Ghosts grow strong by devouring each other!” Zhang Menlie carefully explained, helping Luo Tian understand.

Luo Tian also recalled the jade slips left by Luo Chen, which were similar to Zhang Menlie’s explanation. This was also the traditional method in Hell.

Luo Chen’s method, however, differed from Hell’s tradition—transforming ghost pearls into soul-feeding pills.

Luo Tian admired Luo Chen for devising a system from low-grade to high-grade soul-feeding pills. Unfortunately, Luo Chen hadn’t had the chance to practice it before perishing in that forest.

The following days, Luo Tian retreated into seclusion again, repeatedly attempting to condense ghost pearls for the ghosts to devour. Liu Cheng naturally became the test subject again; all the ghost pearls Luo Tian cultivated were first tested on him.

Liu Cheng’s days turned tragic again; Luo Tian’s ghost pearls were ever-changing, unpredictable. Sometimes they caused unbearable itching, other times excruciating pain.

A month passed quietly. Under Zhang Menlie’s guidance, Luo Tian finally succeeded in cultivating a Yellow Grade ghost pearl, becoming a Yellow Grade Soul-Feeding Master—his initiation was complete.

Chapter 2069: Journey to the Luo Clan ()

In Black Cloud City, Luo Tian stood in the courtyard. Zhang Menlie and Liu Cheng stood on either side, their gazes respectful.

“A month to become a Yellow Grade Soul-Feeding Master—his talent is the best I’ve seen among Soul-Feeding Masters!” Zhang Menlie’s eyes gleamed with admiration.

Zhang Menlie had originally intended to teach Luo Tian all the methods of refining ghost pearls his clan possessed, but he was surprised when Luo Tian outright refused.

Luo Tian aimed to refine his Soul-Feeding Mastery up to the Immortal Grade, but a message from Luo Chen’s jade pendant revealed that the Luo Clan would hold a clan competition in a month. The top three winners would receive丰厚 rewards.

The first-place winner would be awarded a lotus of the Other Side, which made Luo Tian halt his cultivation.

Luo Tian hadn’t forgotten his purpose in Hell: to find the Mother of the Other Side Lotus and heal Zhang Ziping.

These days, in Black Cloud City, he had fully understood the affairs of the Beast Ghost King’s territory. Black Cloud City was a small city, while major clans resided in the Beast King City.

For example, Zhang Menlie’s clan, the Zhang Clan, was a renowned family in the Beast King City. The Luo Clan, Chen Clan, and Yan Clan also resided there.

These clans were royal families with immense power, hence their right to live in the Beast King City. Their fiefdoms lay outside the city.

The Beast Ghost King did this to fear these clans from distancing themselves and escaping his control.

Thus, the Beast King City was vast; families took pride in residing there, as it symbolized status.

The Beast Ghost King had the authority to confer noble titles; the command to grant nobility to those who killed individuals on Hell’s Most Wanted List was issued by him.

“Master, what are we doing?” Zhang Menlie asked respectfully, his face filled with concern. He didn’t know why Luo Tian hadn’t continued studying ghost pearls today.

“We’re going to the Beast Ghost King City!” Luo Tian spoke softly, and Zhang Menlie’s face paled.

“Master, it’s not advisable! The Chen Clan is stationed in the Beast King City—it’s one of the three major clans. If we go like this, it’s like a lamb entering a tiger’s den!” Zhang Menlie quickly spoke, his voice filled with anxiety.

Liu Cheng felt joy instead; if Luo Tian entered the Beast King City, he would be free from Black Cloud City. He had endured enough these days.

Darkness—these days, Liu Cheng lived in darkness; Luo Tian constantly experimented on him, especially with those soul-feeding pearls.

“Don’t worry; I forgot to tell you—my family is also from the Beast King City!” Luo Tian smiled, waving his hand.

“Master, you?” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Zhang Menlie’s eyes brightened and he asked.

“My name is Luo Chen!” Luo Tian spoke, and Zhang Menlie’s face showed shock.

“Luo Chen! So the Master is Luo Chen!” Zhang Menlie stared at Luo Tian, speechless. His clan had some status in the Beast King City; Zhang Menlie knew that one of the three major clans, the Luo Clan, had a son named Luo Chen.

However, according to Zhang Menlie’s knowledge, that son, Luo Chen, was frail and weak, with low strength—only at the level of a Celestial Immortal Mid-Stage. Many people didn’t even know Luo Chen existed.

“Patience!” Zhang Menlie instantly thought of many things, gazing at Luo Tian. This Luo Chen was completely different from the rumors.

“Didn’t they say that Luo Bai treated his younger brother very well? Then why did this Luo Chen hide his strength?” Zhang Menlie was puzzled.

“Let’s go!” As Zhang Menlie pondered, Luo Tian’s voice interrupted his thoughts.

“Yes, Master!” Zhang Menlie bowed, feeling that his decision to follow Luo Tian was perhaps correct.

“Regardless of why this Luo Chen hid, he must have a grand plan. The matters with the Chen Clan and Zhang Clan’s pursuit will all be shouldered by this Luo Chen. Though he is a younger son, he is still part of the Luo Clan; the Luo Clan will certainly protect him.”

“Moreover, this Luo Chen hides his strength, with deep thoughts—he’s not an easy opponent. He will surely rise in the Luo Clan!” Zhang Menlie’s thoughts raced, and he immediately became respectful.

“Master, don’t leave me behind in Black Cloud City!” Liu Cheng, hearing Luo Tian’s words, showed joy. As a ghostly creature, his mind was slower than Zhang Menlie’s, but he knew the Luo Clan was one of the three major clans.

Zhang Menlie and Liu Cheng exchanged glances, their eyes filled with suspicion, then took flight behind Luo Tian toward the Beast Ghost King City.

Black Cloud City was part of the Chen Clan’s territory, so it was only a day away from the Beast King City. The three arrived at its outskirts.

The entire Beast King City was vast, far larger than Black Cloud City. Its forces were complex; even Celestial Immortals had to be cautious within it.

Luo Tian and the two appeared in the Beast King City, their faces calm. The city was lively with people coming and going; however, everyone radiated a chilling ghostly aura—clearly all Hell’s ghost cultivators.

“Master, the Beast King City is divided into three levels. The central area is where the Beast Ghost King resides. Outside of him are royal families; our clan, the Zhang Clan, is in the second level!” Zhang Menlie explained as he introduced the Zhang Clan, his eyes filled with bitterness. However, this bitterness was fleeting, transforming into hatred.

“We are currently in the third level. Though it’s not a royal family, it is much stronger than those outside!” Zhang Menlie continued, introducing Luo Tian.

The three walked along a street ten feet wide. Though people came and went, it wasn’t crowded.

“Zhang Menlie! You dare to appear in the Beast King City!” A furious voice echoed into their ears, causing people on the street to pause.

“Crash…!” Several figures rushed toward Luo Tian’s group, their bodies radiating intense killing intent.

They were all young faces; the leader wore black robes, his body thin. What surprised was his skin—extremely dark, like it had been coated with charcoal.

“Zhang Menyi!” Zhang Menlie instantly recognized the leader, his face flickering slightly.

“Zhang Menlie! I didn’t expect you to return. Do you know the old master is furious and expelled you from the clan?” The charcoal-skinned youth shouted. His companions surrounded Zhang Menlie’s group.

“Zhang Menyi! This Beast King City isn’t your family’s, is it? What do you want?” Zhang Menlie’s face darkened as he shouted back.

Zhang Menlie had once been the clan’s prodigy and heir to the royal title, while Zhang Menyi was merely a subordinate. Now that he had been expelled from the clan, this Zhang Menyi treated him thus.

“Haha! Do you think you’re still the clan’s prodigy?” Zhang Menyi sneered.

“Exactly! Who is Zhang Menlie? Now he’s just a stray dog. Our clan’s prodigy now is only Master Zhang Menyi!” The surrounding youths sneered.

“Master?” Zhang Menlie gazed at Zhang Menyi, his eyes filled with anger, his chest heaving.

But then he shook his head; he knew Zhang Menyi’s character well. When he was powerful, Zhang Menyi flattered him; now that he had been expelled from the family, Zhang Menyi had become the heir.

“I didn’t expect the Zhang Clan to have sunk so low!” Zhang Menlie shook his head gently.

“Zhang Menlie, you didn’t expect this day to come, did you? I’ll tell you—your parents were also executed as traitors by the clan!” Zhang Menyi laughed.

“WHAT!” Hearing Zhang Menyi’s words, Zhang Menlie’s face darkened, his body trembling. His eyes turned bloodshot.

“My father was the next royal master! You!” Zhang Menlie roared, his anger uncontrollable. He flew toward Zhang Menyi.

“Capture him!” Zhang Menyi shouted, then took flight, a black axe appearing in his hand.

“Yes!” His subordinates also attacked. Zhang Menlie knew Zhang Menyi’s strength, so he quickly subdued him.

However, Zhang Menyi’s subordinates were no pushovers; they were all Celestial Immortal Early Stage.

Zhang Menlie’s strength was indeed formidable, but his resources had been depleted in the Yama Palace. At this moment, he could fight two opponents but couldn’t withstand many more.

“Master, help me kill Zhang Menyi! From now on, my life is yours!” Zhang Menlie spat blood and flew to Luo Tian’s side.

“Good!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered slightly, then signaled Liu Cheng. The two moved swiftly toward Zhang Menyi and his group.

With Luo Tian and Liu Cheng’s help, Zhang Menyi and his subordinates were quickly subdued. They were knocked to the ground within moments.

“Kill!” Zhang Menyi roared, his black sword piercing his own throat.

Blood stained the black ground; Zhang Menyi died on the Beast King City’s street, causing a commotion.

“Royal heir killed!” People gasped in surprise, gazing at Luo Tian’s group.

“The former prodigy of the Zhang Clan, Zhang Menlie! He once guarded Hell but was expelled for offending the Chen Clan!” People recognized Zhang Menlie.

“But who are those two? That youth fought so ruthlessly!”

“They must be Zhang Menlie’s allies!” People gazed at Zhang Menlie.

“Go quickly!” Luo Tian spoke to the two, then strode toward the depths of the Beast King City.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Zhang Menlie’s eyes regained clarity. He gazed at Luo Tian deeply before flying after him.

Although the Beast King City allowed fighting, if it wasn’t a life-or-death grudge, no one would fight there.

All were forces within the Beast King City; if someone did this, it would mean a war between two clans. This was an open insult no one could tolerate.

“Who dares to kill my clan’s heir in the Beast King City!” As the three moved away, a middle-aged man appeared among the crowd.

The man wore black robes; his gaze fell on the bloodied corpses, and his eyes flashed with intense killing intent.

“Zhang Qi!”

“Heard the previous clan master was executed, and Zhang Qi became the new clan master. He’s a Celestial Immortal Late Stage and an Earth Grade Soul-Feeding Master!” People murmured, watching the imposing man.

“Not far!” Zhang Qi’s face was grim. He extended his hand, collecting the corpses of Zhang Menyi and his subordinates before taking flight toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Celestial Immortal Late Stage!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered slightly, his vast spiritual sense spreading out instantly to detect Zhang Qi’s aura. His heart tensed.

“Master, the Luo Clan is just ahead!” Zhang Menlie didn’t know what was happening but knew this wouldn’t end well. The Beast King City, besides the Beast Ghost King, only three major clans could stop the Zhang Clan’s fury.

Zhang Menlie felt regret for his impulsive actions, wishing he hadn’t caused this consequence. He was also grateful to Luo Tian for bringing him into the Luo Clan.

Liu Cheng, however, didn’t understand the situation; in his mind, no matter how big a mess they made, the Luo Clan would cover for Luo Chen.

“Zhang Menlie!” Zhang Qi’s speed was strange, and he quickly caught up with Luo Tian’s group. He recognized Zhang Menlie but didn’t notice the others.

At the same time, Luo Tian’s group was only a thousand feet away from the Luo Clan’s gate. That distance would take three breaths for them to cover, but it was only one breath for Zhang Qi.

“Die!” Zhang Qi extended his hand, a black palm crushing toward Luo Tian’s group. He attacked with full power.

“Who are you?” Meanwhile, two Luo Clan members guarding the gate noticed Luo Tian approaching.

“Luo Chen! Open the gate!” Luo Tian shouted, his face slightly changed as the palm descended. The three collided with the Luo Clan’s gate.

“Crash…” The sound echoed, and Luo Tian’s group rushed into the courtyard. A black barrier rose above it.

“Crash…” The black palm collided with the barrier, producing a heavy sound, immediately drawing the attention of the Luo Clan’s elders.

“Who dares to attack my Luo Clan’s array!” A series of figures emerged from the Luo Clan’s territory, shouting angrily. They saw the battered Luo Tian’s group.

“Luo Chen Master!” People gasped, their eyes filled with disbelief as they gazed at the battered Luo Chen.

“Damn it, one of them is a Luo Clan member!” Zhang Qi stood outside the courtyard, his eyes filled with disbelief. Due to his speed, he had only recognized Zhang Menlie.

“Someone is chasing me!” Luo Tian spoke, gazing at the Luo Clan members. Seeing their figures, he was slightly startled; he hadn’t expected the Luo Clan to be so powerful. The people who emerged were all Celestial Immortals, one of whom was a Celestial Immortal Late Stage.

“Chased!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the middle-aged man frowned slightly but sneered and stepped toward the gate.

“Zhang Qi! What are you doing!” The middle-aged man shouted, calling out Zhang Qi’s name and scolding him.

“Uncle, he wants to kill me!” But before the middle-aged man could respond, Luo Tian rushed out of the gate and shouted.

“Uncle Ping, please help me!” Luo Tian cried, his voice filled with anguish. Blood spurted from his mouth and landed on the ground.

“Dust, don’t be afraid. I’ll handle this for you,” Uncle Ping frowned slightly, sensing that Luo Chen was different from before.

“Zhang Qi, leave! This is the Luo Clan; we won’t pursue this matter. If you don’t understand, then there’s no mercy!” Uncle Ping spoke coldly, his voice commanding. The Luo Clan members accompanying him also wore icy expressions, not asking for details.

“Yes…” Zhang Qi’s face showed humiliation as he gazed at the three in the courtyard, but without hesitation, he left the Luo Clan’s gate.

With just one sentence from Chen Tiansheng, Zhang Menlie was expelled from the clan. The Luo Clan is also one of the three major clans, with similar power. Zhang Qi couldn’t risk his newly acquired clan master position for one Zhang Menlie; opposing the three major clans would have the same fate as Zhang Menlie.

“Zhang Menlie, I don’t believe you’ll leave the Luo Clan!” Zhang Qi’s eyes flashed with intense hostility before heading toward the Zhang Clan.

“Thank you, Uncle Ping!” Luo Tian bowed slightly to the middle-aged man, his heart trembling. As he entered the Luo Clan’s courtyard, he felt spiritual senses scanning him.

“Where have you been? Running around everywhere—go to the Ghost崖 (Ghost Cliff) for self-reflection!” Uncle Ping sneered, his voice cold.
