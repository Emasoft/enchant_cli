“Disciple has expended quite a bit, I shall return to rest!” Luotian said respectfully towards the grandfather and granddaughter, his face marked with deference as he addressed Fu Tianqing.

“Hmph, go then. Take this tome; within fifteen days you must master its contents and return to the Alchemical Hall to see me!” Fu Tianqing spoke, handing Luotian another alchemical compendium.

“Disciple takes his leave!” Luotian had no desire to linger, especially with Fu Xingxuan’s gaze filled with hostility.

“Hey, don’t even say goodbye to your senior sister!” As Luotian turned to leave, Fu Xingxuan let out a cold snort, halting his steps.

“Senior Sister, farewell!” Luotian had no choice; though her strength was modest, her influence was formidable.

“Good men don’t suffer present humiliations; the time for retribution hasn’t come yet!” Luotian mentally reassured himself, offering a respectful smile to Fu Xingxuan.

“Hmph, go then. If you encounter Xiao Ding, tell him to return sooner; the Alchemical Hall needs talents like him!” Fu Xingxuan approached Luotian, her face alight with a city-shaking smile.

Though Fu Xingxuan smiled, Luotian felt an icy chill creeping over him.

“Certainly!” Luotian had grown terrified of Fu Xingxuan, fleeing the Alchemical Hall like a man possessed.

“Grandfather, you truly accepted this boy?” Once Luotian was far away, Fu Xingxuan turned to Fu Tianqing.

But as she spun around, Fu Tianqing had vanished. A sly smile crossed her lips: “Even I noticed something amiss; how could Grandfather miss it? I hope this boy doesn’t harbor ulterior motives. Otherwise, no one can save him!”

“Hmph…” Luotian sighed deeply, finding a secluded corner to revert to Fu Mengchen’s guise.

“Truly testing my acting skills!” Luotian muttered under his breath, cursing the multitude of roles he had played these days.

As he stepped out from the corner, Luotian’s body halted—his entire being felt a chill as an aged figure stood before him, smiling lazily.

“Boy, even I almost fell for your deception!” Fu Tianqing stood there, watching Luotian emerge from the corner.

“Ah…” Cold sweat immediately dripped down Luotian’s face. He hadn’t expected Fu Tianqing to follow him here, and he had sensed nothing.

“Elder… it’s a coincidence!” Luotian forced himself to remain calm, his face marked with deference as he addressed Fu Tianqing.

“Hmph. You have one quarter of an hour to explain, convincing me of your words. If I don’t believe you, no one in Star Moon Divine City can save you!” Fu Tianqing’s smile remained, but his words struck Luotian like a thunderclap.

“Very well.” Luotian nodded, his gaze flickering as he carefully composed his thoughts on what to say and what to omit.

“He didn’t recognize me as a human. If he had, he would’ve killed me without hesitation!” After a brief pause, Luotian’s mind steadied.

“Elder, you know I’ve only just arrived in Star Moon Divine City. Recently, my reputation has grown. Regarding elixirs, I do have some knowledge—ask the Second Prince; he knows I used medicinal pills in the Wilderness City!” Luotian bowed respectfully. His life now rested in Fu Tianqing’s hands.

Chapter 1304: Forging the Severing Heaven Pill

“Indeed, only some knowledge. However, those elixirs were all crafted by Xiao Ding. I met him before entering the Divine City; thus, after becoming Grand Commander of Star Moon Guard, I had him join as well!”

“I concealed my identity to avoid drawing too much attention. After all, the three princes are currently in tense rivalry. My cultivation of the Cyclic Heaven Art has already drawn two princes’ attention; if I drew more, my fame would be even greater!” Luotian’s gaze met Fu Tianqing’s. He believed Fu Tianqing understood his meaning.

“Hmph.” Fu Tianqing merely nodded slightly, gazing at Luotian. His hand flicked a golden mirror, which barely perceptibly glowed.

“Good. No lies,” Fu Tianqing pocketed the mirror, his eyes revealing satisfaction.

“Then I won’t trouble you further. You remain my disciple. Next time, no need to hide; with me here, few in Star Moon Divine City could harm you!” Fu Tianqing spoke softly, signaling Luotian to relax.

“Hmph…” Luotian sighed deeply, silently cursing. This old man must have known whether he lied—undoubtedly due to that mirror.

“Thankfully, Xiao Ding and Wang Ding are both me!” Luotian felt relieved, offering a respectful bow to Fu Tianqing: “Thank you, Master!”

“Go then. Take this token; it will save your life once in Star Moon Continent!” Fu Tianqing smiled, finally accepting Luotian as his disciple. He waved his hand, and a token fell into Luotian’s grasp.

“Star Moon Divine Mandate. I once had two of these when I was the Divine Emperor. One went to Fu Xingxuan, and this one to you. With it, even the Star Moon Divine Emperor cannot harm you! From now on, be open and bold as your commander!” Fu Tianqing spoke before vanishing from Luotian’s sight.

“Alas…” Luotian sighed, storing the token. He wasn’t heartless; he knew if they met on the battlefield, he could never strike against Star Moon Divine Clan members—Fu Xingxuan, who had repeatedly troubled him, he felt no desire to kill.

“Let the future take care of itself. For now, I must grow stronger. If I become an Epoch Master, the Ancient Royal Clans would dare not start a war!” Luotian calmed himself, not returning to his quarters but flying toward the city’s outskirts.

...

Time flowed slowly. The sky gradually brightened, and the sun rose in Star Moon Divine City’s east.

Luotian found a remote peak over a hundred miles from the city, seated in meditation to adjust his state.

Once the sun fully rose, Luotian opened his eyes. A cascade of holy light radiated from his hands, forming a barrier that enveloped ten miles around.

“Boom…” The Seven Star Tremor Vessel roared, crashing onto the unyielding ground.

“Begin! Severing Heaven Pill—how long will it take? I hope time is on my side!” Luotian spoke softly, familiarly pressing his palm onto the fire’s mouth.

While Luotian forged the Severing Heaven Pill, people in Star Moon Divine City began discussing yesterday’s Wang Ding. Some searched for Wang Ding but found no trace.

Thus, Wang Ding became the third topic of conversation after Grand Commander Fu Mengchen and elixir genius Xiao Ding.

“Star Moon Divine City has been lively recently. Besides the Grand Commander, the other two have vanished completely—no one can find them. Strange,” people murmured.

Yet some sensed Xiao Ding and Wang Ding might be closely connected, as both names contained the character “ding” (vessel).

Subsequently, Fu Xingxuan’s admirers also included Wang Ding in their search, believing finding Wang Ding would reveal Xiao Ding’s whereabouts.

Fu Xingxuan said nothing but visited the Alchemical Hall several times. After her final exit, she wore a satisfied expression.

However, this storm lasted only two days. On the third day, an imperial decree from Star Moon Divine Emperor announced a three-army competition in three days.

Instantly, the city’s focus shifted to the three-army contest. Whose army was strongest became the people’s main topic.

“Probably Star Moon Guard; they’ve always been the strongest,” some said.

“This time might not be so. Star Moon Guard has a new commander; their cohesion is surely inferior to Star Yang and Star Star Guards!” others countered.

“Moreover, haven’t you heard? The new Grand Commander of Star Moon Guard seems close to the Third Prince. The Third Prince has long monopolized the Cyclic Heaven Art’s stone tablet, and it was Fu Commander who was to cultivate it!” people debated.

Meanwhile, the relationship between Luotian and Fu Xingyang gradually spread. With deliberate propagation, it swept through Star Moon Divine City, growing increasingly absurd.

“Hear this? The Grand Commander of Star Moon Guard will betray the Second Prince during the contest, deliberately giving Star Star Guard an advantage!” The city buzzed with this rumor.

Coincidentally, Luotian had been outside the city forging elixirs these two days, unable to make a sound. He could only let this rumor spread.

Even Star Moon Guard had some people unsettled, as the rumor spread from mouth to mouth. People began to believe it.

“Second Prince, Star Moon Guard’s morale is unstable; most have believed the rumor. When will the Grand Commander return? If he doesn’t, I fear problems may arise!” Fu Zhiming’s face showed anxiety as he addressed Fu Xingyue.

“Don’t worry. Mengchen will return!”

“Go and reassure them, calming the people’s minds,” Fu Xingyue smiled at Fu Zhiming.

“Yes!” Fu Zhiming sighed deeply. As Deputy Grand Commander, he was well-informed.

Fu Zhiming knew this three-army contest might relate to the throne. If Star Moon Guard lost, it would likely lose points in the Divine Emperor’s eyes. And if Fu Xingyue didn’t secure the position, his fate wouldn’t be good either. In every new emperor’s ascension, someone must shed blood to forge the throne.

Watching Fu Zhiming leave, Fu Xingyue’s eyes darkened: “Mengchen… I hope you succeed. I’ve bet everyone’s future on you. Hope you don’t disappoint me!”

The city’s news made Fu Xingyue feel uneasy. Recalling the moments he met Luotian, everything seemed too suspicious. But now, Fu Xingyue had no choice but to trust, as he was gambling—betting his instincts were right.

Time flowed slowly. Two days passed in a flash, but Star Moon Guard’s Grand Commander still hadn’t returned, making people believe the rumor more.

“Seems true. Tomorrow is the contest day; Fu Mengchen hasn’t appeared yet! I heard he’s not in Star Moon Pavilion either!” People murmured, sympathizing with Fu Xingyue.

Amidst the city’s discussions, the contest day finally arrived. The entire Star Moon Divine City was energized.

Star Moon Divine Realm, a small world opened by the former Star Moon Divine Clan’s king. Only one person in Star Moon Divine City could open it—Star Moon Divine Emperor.

“Go!” Fu Zhiming gritted his teeth, leading a thousand selected Star Moon Guards toward the Star Moon Divine Realm.

“Haha, Fu Mengchen is cooperating with me. He hasn’t appeared yet!” Fu Xingyang smiled, leading a thousand Star Star Guards toward the realm.

“Go on. Let me see what your two brothers have to offer!” Fu Xingyang smiled, followed by Kou Tiande and a thousand bloodthirsty Tianlang soldiers leaving Star Yang Pavilion.

In the Star Moon Divine Realm, Star Moon Divine Emperor Fu Tianba sat on a luxurious dragon throne. Beside him stood influential figures in Star Moon Divine City—men who could shake the city with a single step, yet now appeared cautious before Fu Tianba.

Fu Tianba, Star Moon Divine Emperor, with cultivation at the middle Epoch. Though he had no remarkable achievements, people knew Fu Tianba was as霸道 (domineering) as his name. He ruled his sons with iron will, forcing them to compete.

“Respectful greetings, Father!” Fu Xingyang, Fu Xingyue, and Fu Xingyang appeared before the crowd, kneeling before Fu Tianba.

“Hmph.” Fu Tianba nodded, scanning his three sons. Then he spoke softly: “Begin!”

“Father, may I request a brief delay? My Star Moon Guard Grand Commander has some matters to attend. Please grant him time; he should arrive shortly!” Fu Xingyue, with gritted teeth, respectfully addressed Fu Tianba.

“Hmph?” Fu Tianba’s brows furrowed slightly. He looked toward Star Moon Guard, his expression showing displeasure.

“How do you manage your subordinates? Such an important matter could be delayed!” Fu Tianba reprimanded.

“Second Brother, let’s start. I guess your Grand Commander won’t come!” Fu Xingyang smiled confidently, addressing Fu Xingyue.

Hearing Fu Xingyang’s words, everyone looked at Fu Xingyue with sympathy. The rumor about these two days was known to all.

“Father, grant me half an hour!” Fu Xingyue remained undeterred by Fu Xingyang’s words, his gaze resolute toward Fu Tianba.

“Hmph. Grant half an hour; if he doesn’t arrive, your Star Moon Guard will be disqualified! If you agree, wait a while. Otherwise, start now. Consider it!” Fu Tianba spoke softly, his gaze on Fu Xingyue.

Hearing Fu Tianba’s words, Fu Xingyue’s face changed. He looked at Fu Xingyang with deep eyes and Fu Xingyang’s smug expression, as well as the listless Star Moon Guards. He gritted his teeth and nodded firmly.

“Good. Everyone, rest half an hour. I also want to see what talent this Grand Commander of Star Moon Guard has!” Fu Tianba leaned back on his throne.

“Boom…” As Fu Tianba’s words finished, a series of thunderous sounds echoed through the unique realm.

“What sound is that?” People looked puzzled, sensing it wasn’t from this Star Moon Divine Realm but from outside.

“Did someone attack Star Moon Divine City?” People furrowed their brows, tension in their eyes.

“This is a Heavenly Tribulation!” Fu Tianba spoke softly, frowning slightly. He pointed his finger, and the realm’s sky became transparent, revealing Star Moon Divine City.

At this moment, people in Star Moon Divine City were stirred. Their eyes turned toward the city’s outskirts.

“Hold on!” Luotian’s gaze was filled with excitement, watching a golden elixir like the sun in the sky. Golden lightning continuously struck it, fierce Heavenly Tribulation making Luotian feel awe.

“Someone is undergoing a Heavenly Tribulation outside Star Moon Divine City?” Even from afar, people could see the terrifying tribulation and its power.

“This is a Heavenly Tribulation. Could it be an Epoch Heavenly Tribulation? It’s already this fierce!” People murmured, not daring to leave the city but watching the blurry tribulation.

“Undergoing a Heavenly Tribulation!” Fu Xingyue stood in Star Moon Divine Realm, his heart excited. Hearing the city’s people talk, he knew there was an 80% chance it was Fu Mengchen undergoing the tribulation.

At this moment, Luotian’s eyes were fixed on the elixir in the sky. After three days of effort, he had finally forged the Severing Heaven Pill, using two sacred herbs and even adding a drop of immortal elixir. It was the second most difficult elixir he had ever forged, after the Cyclic Heaven Pill.

Terrifying Heavenly Tribulations continuously washed over the elixir. The golden elixir seemed unaffected, radiating intense gold light and hovering in the sky.

“Absorbing Heavenly Tribulation’s Dao essence!” Luotian narrowed his eyes, sensing the elixir’s terrifying power.

“Indeed, a truly astonishing elixir!” Luotian was awestruck.

After about a quarter of an hour, golden lightning ceased. A pair of crimson eyes gradually appeared in the black storm clouds, radiating supreme power, as if looking down upon all beings. They emitted red light, forming a blood-red “sin” character that pressed toward the Severing Heaven Pill.

“Rebellious! It’s like a normal human or royal clan member undergoing an Epoch Heavenly Tribulation!” Luotian was awestruck, seeing the familiar “sin” character and speaking out in shock.

“It’s an Epoch Heavenly Tribulation!” People in Star Moon Divine City felt the overwhelming aura, even from afar. They could clearly see the “sin” character’s terrifying aura and spoke out in shock.

“Who is undergoing an Epoch Heavenly Tribulation? Why didn’t they choose to do it in the Star Moon Pavilion?” People were puzzled, watching the blood-red “sin” character descend toward the golden light. They had taken that glimmer as the one undergoing the tribulation.

“Epoch Heavenly Tribulation! Who is it? When did Star Moon Divine City produce such a person!” People in the Star Moon Divine Realm also showed confusion, exchanging glances.

Only Fu Xingyue’s eyes held a hint of satisfaction, his mind calmed. He folded his arms and stood beside Fu Tianba.

“Hmph?” Fu Tianba sensed Fu Xingyue’s ease and glanced at him, then his lips curled slightly.

“If the Heavenly Tribulation is successful, there’s no need for this contest!” Fu Tianba thought to himself, no longer paying attention to the outside.

“Hum…” Luotian didn’t act but watched the golden elixir in the sky. His fists clenched tightly.

“Boom…” A dull sound echoed on the golden Severing Heaven Pill. The blood-red “sin” character gradually shrank, then vanished into the elixir.

Then a strange fluctuation spread through Luotian’s mind, making him extremely tense.

“It started absorbing again!” Luotian’s eyes showed intense shock. He knew the “sin” character’s terror, but he hadn’t expected the Severing Heaven Pill to absorb even the Dao essence within it.

“Severing Heaven Pill—severing Heavenly Dao!” Luotian finally understood why the Severing Heaven Master named it so.

“One breath… two breaths…” As Luotian watched, the golden elixir didn’t show any damage but emitted powerful energy, astonishing Luotian.

Within a quarter of an hour, the black storm clouds gradually dissipated. The golden elixir soared into the sky and flew away.

“Trying to escape?” Luotian smiled, his body flickering with white light. He instantly appeared before the elixir and grabbed it.

“Hum…” As Luotian touched the elixir, an invisible fluctuation flew from his body and was absorbed by it.

“This must be the decay power within me!” Luotian didn’t hesitate, swallowing the elixir.

The golden Severing Heaven Pill didn’t dissolve in Luotian’s body but settled into his dantian, radiating a strong pull to absorb the hidden decay power within him.

In just a moment, Luotian felt lighter, as if something had been removed from his body.

“Boom…” After absorbing the decay power, the golden elixir exploded in Luotian’s dantian, releasing a terrifying energy that completely filled his dantian.

“Cyclic Heaven Art!” Luotian’s eyes lit up, immediately activating the Cyclic Heaven Art to refine the terrifying elixir energy.

“Amazing! It transformed Heavenly Dao into Epoch power!” Luotian was overjoyed, his Cyclic Heaven Art spinning rapidly.

As Luotian refined it continuously, a pure white figure gradually formed—his second Slaughter Immortal Body. However, this second body was less solid than the first, appearing more ethereal, obviously not yet complete.

“Not bad! This was an unexpected gain!” Luotian muttered, his eyes showing a smile.

“Now it’s time to show the appearance of an Epoch beginner!” Luotian sighed, then his body soared into the air. A massive Epoch power radiated from him, terrifying energy spreading outward.

“Success!” People in Star Moon Divine City were amazed, feeling Luotian’s overwhelming aura—unique to an Epoch beginner.

“Back I go. I wonder if the contest has started!” Luotian smiled, his body turning into a streak of white light toward Star Moon Divine City.

“Someone is flying toward Star Moon Divine City!” People spoke in shock, watching the streak of light. They wanted to know who had successfully entered an Epoch beginner.

Before their words finished, Luotian’s figure appeared above Star Moon Divine City. He waved the Star Moon Mandate to prevent the city’s barrier from attacking him.

“It’s Grand Commander Fu Mengchen of Star Moon Guard!” As Luotian appeared, the entire city erupted in excitement. Their eyes showed disbelief as they watched his figure in the sky.

Not only Star Moon Divine City, but people throughout the city were also stunned. Their faces showed disbelief as they gazed at Luotian’s image, his aura reaching the sky.

No one expected Luotian to appear at this moment, and in such a state—Epoch beginner.

“Indeed, I wasn’t disappointed!” Fu Xingyue sighed deeply, speaking softly. His eyes regained their usual confidence.

“How is this possible!” Fu Xingyang’s eyes widened, shouting in disbelief.

“This boy is extraordinary!” Fu Tianba looked at Luotian’s image, his brows slightly furrowed.

“Can you control him?” Fu Tianba asked Fu Xingyue beside him, his voice uncertain.

Hearing Fu Tianba’s words, Fu Xingyue shuddered. His mind was deep in thought; Luotian’s growth speed was too fast, even faster than himself and Fu Xingyang.

“Yes,” Fu Xingyue nodded slightly. He thought of the moment Luotian had shielded him from a蛮魂 (barbarian soul) attack, his eyes resolute.

“Good,” Fu Tianba nodded slightly. He then extended his hand, sending an invisible fluctuation that instantly passed through the image and landed on Luotian.

“Hmph?” Luotian stood there, about to ask where the contest was held. Then he felt a powerful fluctuation on his body.

“Slaughter Immortal Body!” Luotian roared, the two Slaughter Immortal Bodies in his dantian exploding. A furious Epoch power instantly filled Luotian’s entire body.

“Don’t resist!” As Luotian was about to rebel, a domineering and authoritative voice echoed in his mind. He stopped the Slaughter Immortal Body’s operation.

Chapter 1306: What Good Is Unity?

Hearing this voice, Luotian immediately abandoned his resistance. He let the power drag him away from Star Moon Divine City’s view.

“Hum…” The fluctuation spread. Luotian instantly appeared within the Star Moon Divine Realm, where figures emerged before his eyes.

“Respectful greetings to the Divine Emperor!” Luotian bowed, gazing at Fu Tianba on the throne.

This was Luotian’s first time seeing the Star Moon Divine Emperor. His eyes were cautious as he observed Fu Tianba, then his mind stirred.

“Epoch middle stage, approaching Epoch end! It seems the Divine Emperor will step down once entering the Epoch end!”

“Too powerful are the Ancient Royal Clans. If they enter the Nine Domains, how can the Nine Domains resist?” Luotian felt heavy-hearted. The蛮族 (barbarians) were already strong, but the Star Moon Divine Clan was even stronger in his view.

Thinking of other royal clans existing, Luotian felt a suffocating pressure. His mind was under great stress.

“Why is he so strong? Was it because of the Severing Heaven Master’s seal, or due to the seal?” Luotian muttered. His face showed deference.

“Hmph, good,” Fu Tianba glanced at Luotian. His expression of concern faded quickly. For some reason, he felt a hint of danger from Luotian.

“How is this possible!” Fu Xingyang’s face showed shock, speaking in disbelief. He couldn’t fathom how Luotian had entered the Epoch beginner stage so quickly.

“It’s the Grand Commander! The Grand Commander has returned. These past days, he was pushing to enter the Epoch beginner!” Star Moon Guard people erupted in chaos. They murmured lowly, looking at Luotian’s strong aura.

“We misunderstood the Grand Commander!” They then recalled the rumor, harboring intense resentment toward those who spread the unreliable information.

“Epoch beginner?” Kou Tiande stood before Star Yang Guard, his eyes bitter. He hadn’t expected Luotian to enter the Epoch beginner stage. With one Epoch beginner participating in the three-army contest, the results would be reversed.

“Good. Since time has come, let’s begin!” Fu Tianba收回 his gaze and addressed the three princes.

“Respectfully obeyed!” Some rejoiced, others mourned. Fu Xingyue’s face showed joy as he spoke loudly and approached Luotian.

“Mengchen, rely on you. I’ve taken a lot of pressure to secure time for you!” Fu Xingyue patted Luotian’s shoulder, smiling.

“Second Prince, rest assured!” Luotian bowed respectfully. His eyes flashed with confidence. He himself didn’t know how terrifying his power could be now. He was confident that if he were alone, the outcome would already be decided.

“Too great a gap!” Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyang exchanged glances, seeing each other’s helplessness.

Luotian soared before Star Moon Guard. The previously listless soldiers showed excitement on their faces.

“Grand Commander!” One thousand Star Moon Guards bowed respectfully. Their voices were like a different person compared to their previous listlessness.

“Good, everyone prepare!” Luotian smiled, scanning the soldiers’ faces.

“The three-army contest begins!” Fu Tianba’s voice echoed in Star Moon Divine Realm. Instantly, everyone began watching the three armies.

“Star Yang Army!” Kou Tiande roared, leading a thousand fierce Tianlang soldiers. They instantly howled in unison.

“Hoo…” A deep wolf roar split the sky, echoing through Star Moon Divine Realm. Intense battle spirit and bloodthirsty intent coalesced into a crimson beast, enveloping the thousand Tianlang soldiers and Kou Tiande. Kou Tiande stood at the wolf’s head.

“Tianlang Clan lacks peak strength; if they had it, they would be another royal clan!” A middle-aged man beside Fu Tianba spoke.

“Hmph, a pity,” Fu Tianba nodded slightly. He thought of how the Star Moon Divine Clan’s king had struggled to subdue the Tianlang people.

Ferociousness was the Tianlang Clan’s nature. If they went mad, even Star Moon Guard would sometimes avoid their wrath.

“Star Star Army!” Fu Xingyang stood before the Star Star Army, his face showing grimness. He seemed like a different person as he spoke softly.

“Here!” Each Star Star Soldier showed fierce battle spirit, responding in unison. Their bodies radiated starlight, their eyes burning with intensity toward Fu Xingyang.

Correctly, the Star Star Army had no true Grand Commander. Fu Xingyang was their pillar, more convincing than a regular Grand Commander.

“Hum…” The hum of stars rose. Each star flickered, eventually gathering around Fu Xingyang, enveloping him.

“It’s our turn!” Luotian looked at his soldiers behind him, a smile on his face.

“Everyone, though we haven’t trained together, I believe we don’t need training. Star Moon Guard has always been the best; this time is no different. I don’t want Star Moon Guard’s undefeated legend to end with me!” Luotian spoke loudly, his body soaring into the sky. His vast spiritual awareness instantly enveloped the thousand Star Moon Guards.

“Battle!” One thousand soldiers, their minds stirred. After Luotian’s return, their confidence surged. Now, his words ignited their battle spirit and pride, making their aura soar even higher than the other two armies.

Though Luotian was first to merge with Star Moon Guard’s battle spirit, there was no awkwardness. His vast spiritual awareness allowed him to grasp every detail of the formation.

“Boom…” Thunderous sounds rose. Star Moon Guards flowed around Luotian, forming a massive giant figure instantly. It became tangible, as if flesh and blood, with Luotian at its heart, directing the entire giant.

At this moment, Luotian felt like he had become a giant himself, possessing fierce power.

“Hoo…” A deep roar echoed again. A crimson beast approached Luotian and the Star Moon Guards’ giant, snarling.

Luotian had no doubt that a half-epoch strength being would be devoured by this crimson beast, leaving nothing but bones.

“Boom…” White light rose. Luminous stars illuminated the entire Star Moon Divine Realm, carrying terrifying pressure toward the Star Moon Guard’s giant.

“Grand Commander’s strength determines the battle formation!” Luotian, as the core of the formation, now fully understood.

Though Star Yang Army and Star Star Army formed a wolf and stars respectively, their Grand Commanders were only half-epoch strength. Moreover, the selected soldiers of both armies were slightly inferior to Star Moon Guard’s. Overall, none could match Luotian’s side.

Thus, unity became their best option. Only by uniting with Star Moon Guard could they defeat them and have a chance to win!

“Unity? What good is it?” Luotian felt unusually powerful. He waved his fist, striking the descending stars.

The thunderous sound echoed. Star Star Soldiers all spat blood, including Fu Xingyang. They were the same.

“Hoo…” As Luotian controlled the giant’s body to strike the stars, the crimson beast also snarled toward them. Though its movement seemed slow, it instantly became a red light and rushed to the giant’s throat.

Luotian roared, his spiritual awareness like a command. It instantly passed through each Star Moon Guard’s mind. They responded quickly, forming a mountain-like golden fist that struck the wolf.

But Luotian’s reaction speed was fast, yet his disadvantage of not having trained with Star Moon Guard showed. His speed was still half a beat behind.

“Boom…” The wolf’s fangs bit into the giant’s wrist. Instantly, dozens of Star Moon Guards were expelled from the formation. However, they suffered no major injuries; after all, the thousand Star Moon Guards were a single entity—loss of one meant loss for all.

“Speed up. He’s not keeping up. First, unite to eliminate Star Moon Guard, then deal with Fu Mengchen!” Kou Tiande, having noticed Luotian’s weakness, addressed Fu Xingyang within the stars.

“Good!” Fu Xingyang nodded. He activated the star formation, sending it rushing toward the giant.

On the other side, the crimson beast also snarled, rushing toward Luotian and Star Moon Guard. Its icy fangs glowed with cold light, as if wanting to tear them apart.

“Have they found our weakness?” Luotian thought, then his face showed coldness: “Comrades, follow me to fight!”

His words finished. The giant showed no fear or evasion but rushed toward the wolf, its massive body carrying powerful presence. It clashed with both armies continuously.

Each collision sent several people flying out, their faces pale.
