At this moment, no sect dared to underestimate the Elixir Hall of the Five Elements Sect. Those geniuses who had once attempted to provoke the Elixir Hall had fallen silent, no longer daring to confront it directly. The reputation of the Five Elements Sect's Elixir Hall once again echoed across the Northern Region, and all knew that among the Five Elements Sect's strongest peaks was the Elixir Hall.

Luo Tian and other disciples of the Five Elements Sect moved quietly, continuously searching through major cities in the Northern Region for signs of the Sky Corpse Sect.

At this time, Luo Tian, Zhang Hongyun, and Feng Qianyu wandered through a city. This city was none other than Zhang Hongyun's ancestral domain—Wentian City!

Wentian City was a renowned city in the Northern Region, larger than Tianyuan City. Zhang Hongyun wore an air of ease as he led the group into the city's governor's mansion.

"Luo Tian, don't worry. I believe you can overcome this obstacle! This journey is a good opportunity to clear your mind!" Zhang Hongyun patted Luo Tian's shoulder in reassurance.

Luo Tian wore a bitter smile. He had already planned to seek solutions on his own, but Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu had dragged him out, claiming they were searching for the Sky Corpse Sect's whereabouts. However, Luo Tian knew their real intention was to let him relax.

"I'm fine!" Luo Tian sighed helplessly, indicating he had no problems.

But Zhang Hongyun nodded in agreement. "Yes, yes! You're fine!" His eyes clearly betrayed the opposite.

Luo Tian turned to Feng Qianyu, who returned his gaze with an expression that clearly said, "Don't lose your mind."

Luo Tian felt exasperated by the two. He had no energy to explain further, as every time he did, they grew more suspicious. He'd already explained countless times on the journey.

Since Wentian City was a major city in the Northern Region, no one from the Sky Corpse Sect dared to cause trouble here. After all, cities now had not only their own lords' forces but also disciples from various sects constantly patrolling major cities. Even some experts at the Bone-Subjugation Initial Stage might be found in these metropolises.

Under Zhang Hongyun's guidance, the three walked along Wentian City's wide streets. Observing the crowded people on the street, Zhang Hongyun sighed softly: "The old Wentian City never had so many people. It must be residents from nearby smaller cities coming to seek refuge!"

Hearing Zhang Hongyun's words, Feng Qianyu wore a look of concern. Their cities were close, and they had once been rivals. But Feng Qianyu knew their city was much smaller than Wentian City, and he wondered how his family's city fared now.

Seeing Feng Qianyu's concern, Zhang Hongyun patted his shoulder. "Don't worry. I know my father's strength. If our family is fine, your family should be okay too!"

The three navigated through the crowd and finally reached Wentian City's governor's mansion. The guards at the gate naturally recognized Zhang Hongyun. Upon seeing him return, they wore expressions of joy and hurried to inform the interior.

Not long after, a middle-aged man strode out with an imposing gait. Upon seeing Zhang Hongyun, he wore a look of joy.

"Father!" Zhang Hongyun shouted and fell to his knees in reverence.

"You little scoundrel! Why are you kneeling when you return?" The middle-aged man shouted, helping Zhang Hongyun up. His face showed excitement; it had been a long time since he'd seen his son, and he was dearly missed.

"Who are these two? Introduce them!" The middle-aged man, after helping Zhang Hongyun up, turned his gaze to Feng Qianyu and Luo Tian.

"Is this Qianyu?" The middle-aged man looked at Feng Qianyu, who bore a scar on his face, and asked softly.

"Uncle, it's been a while!" Feng Qianyu bowed slightly, smiling.

"And who is this?" The middle-aged man looked at Luo Tian and asked Zhang Hongyun.

"Oh, I almost forgot to introduce him. Father, this is Luo Tian!" Zhang Hongyun said nonchalantly.

"Ah! I almost forgot to introduce him. Father, this is Luo Tian!" Zhang Hongyun then introduced Luo Tian.

Upon hearing his son refer to the young man as Luo Tian, Zhang Huiyang showed a look of surprise. As the governor of Wentian City, he had heard about Luo Tian's presence in the Five Elements Sect. He knew this former prodigy could only reach the Body-Cultivation Ninth Stage and was unable to enter the Bone-Subjugation Stage.

But Zhang Huiyang never expected this boy with a calm gaze to be the Luo Tian people spoke of. This youth bore no signs of being defeated, but instead radiated a steady brilliance in his eyes, making Zhang Huiyang, who was also at the Body-Cultivation Ninth Stage, feel this youth was definitely no ordinary person.

Luo Tian didn't overthink it. He bowed respectfully to Zhang Huiyang and said softly, "I've troubled you, Uncle."

"Where's the trouble? It's an honor for the Five Elements Sect's disciple to visit my Wentian City. I hope you won't find it too modest!" Zhang Huiyang smiled and led Luo Tian and Feng Qianyu into the governor's mansion.

That night, Zhang Huiyang naturally treated Luo Tian and Feng Qianyu with great hospitality. To Feng Qianyu's surprise, his father, Feng Feiyang, was also in Wentian City. Not only that, but all of his family had moved into Wentian City—though not residing in the governor's mansion.

After questioning, Feng Qianyu learned their city had been attacked by the Sky Corpse Sect. Only a few of his family's direct descendants had been rescued, and Feng Feiyang had nowhere to go. He had thus brought his entire family to Wentian City.

Feng Qianyu arrived in Wentian City, and naturally Zhang Huiyang invited Feng Feiyang over. Their relationship had always been good, so it was easy to invite him.

Upon hearing about the destruction of Tianfeng City, Feng Qianyu's face showed a fierce expression. The scar on his face became even more terrifying due to the blood rush: "Destroying the Sky Corpse Sect will be my life's goal from now on!"

Chapter 267: Gathering in Wentian City

Chapter 267: Gathering in Wentian City

That night, Feng Qianyu became so drunk he was led out of the governor's mansion by his father with a sigh. Meanwhile, Luo Tian was accommodated in the governor's mansion under Zhang Huiyang's arrangements.

The next morning, Zhang Hongyun dragged Luo Tian out and headed toward Feng Qianyu's new home. It wasn't far from the governor's mansion, and the three quickly gathered together. They wandered around Wentian City under the pretense of strolling, but their spiritual senses continuously extended to try and find any signs of Sky Corpse Sect members.

Several powerful auras appeared within Luo Tian's spiritual senses, causing him to pause and think.

As Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu entered the Bone-Subjugation Initial Stage, their spiritual senses also reached the Spiritual Awareness Initial Stage. Their range had expanded significantly compared to Luo Tian's Spiritual Awareness Peak, but they still couldn't detect the auras near the city gates.

Luo Tian noticed these people constantly heading toward the governor's mansion. However, their attire didn't match that of the Sky Corpse Sect. The Sky Corpse Sect's members always carried an annoying aura, and even if they tried to hide it, their spiritual senses at the Spiritual Awareness Peak could not miss it.

"Let's go! Your family has visitors!" Luo Tian noticed two familiar figures in the crowd and smiled.

Feng Qianyu and Zhang Hongyun wore expressions of surprise. Though they knew Luo Tian's spiritual senses were strong, they hadn't expected them to be this powerful. They had seen nothing, but Luo Tian had already detected people heading toward the governor's mansion.

"City Governor of Wentian City, come out and meet me!" A young voice echoed above the governor's mansion. Several young figures simultaneously appeared at the entrance of the governor's mansion.

Hearing the call, Zhang Huiyang took no chances. He quickly stepped out of the gates and said softly, "Which friend is looking for me?"

"I am from the Shadow Flow Sect. We've come to Wentian City. Please arrange a place for us. Preferably, have your governor's mansion vacated. Oh, and there's a young man named Luo Tian who should be in your Wentian City. Please find him for us; our senior has a reward for him!" A disciple stepped forward and spoke imperiously to Zhang Huiyang.

"Shadow Flow Sect?" Zhang Huiyang muttered internally. The Shadow Flow Sect was a second-rate sect, and as the governor of Wentian City, he had heard of it before. However, they had never had any contact. Upon hearing the dismissive tone, Zhang Huiyang's brows furrowed slightly.

"Still looking? Don't you hurry up and make space?" The young disciple, sensing the reluctance of the blue-cloaked youth, shouted loudly.

"Who do you think you are? Daring to speak like that to my father! Is the Shadow Flow Sect so important?" Zhang Hongyun's face darkened as he walked over from a distance, looking at the Shadow Flow Sect disciples.

"Luotian!" The blue-cloaked youth shifted his gaze, seeing Luo Tian and the three of them—especially Luo Tian. His face showed a joyous expression, but not one of reunion; it was the joy of discovering an enemy.

"Lan Yichen!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a hint of amusement, recalling the scene in the tree hole of Dahan Forest. He instinctively rubbed his nose.

"Luo Tian, you really did make me search hard! Ha! Today I'll wash away my previous humiliation!" Lan Yichen shouted, his body radiating the aura of the Bone-Subjugation Initial Stage.

The disciple who had scolded Zhang Huiyang stood by Lan Yichen. Upon seeing the opportunity, he wore a sycophantic smile and said loudly: "Senior Brother Lan, this Body-Cultivation Ninth Stage fellow is beneath me. I'll take him down and leave him to your judgment!"

After saying this, his aura suddenly changed. To the surprise of Luo Tian and the others, this foolish-looking person was actually at the Bone-Subjugation Stage.

Although Lan Yichen's aura was formidable, it was clear that Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu's auras were even more terrifying. This Miao Dapeng dared to capture Luo Tian!

Lan Yichen heard Miao Dapeng's words and his lips twitched slightly. He had thought he would just challenge Luo Tian to regain face, but hadn't expected his foolish companion to claim he'd capture Luo Tian. He inwardly cursed: "You don't think those two are invisible, do you?"

"Unexpectedly, Lan Yichen has arrived first!" A voice echoed as Leng Yulong and several others appeared before them.

Hearing Leng Yulong's voice, Lan Yichen furrowed his brows. He had expected to be the first to attack Luo Tian and defeat him, but instead found himself arriving just as Leng Yulong did.

Luo Tian, Zhang Hongyun, and the others furrowed their brows. They hadn't made a big deal about coming down from the mountain, but they knew Luo Tian was currently in the spotlight. Though these people wouldn't dare to trouble the Five Elements Sect, it didn't mean they would refrain from attacking Luo Tian if they met him. After all, who would miss an opportunity to bring down Luo Tian?

"Luotian! Dare you fight!"

Leng Yulong's eyes carried a hint of contempt as he looked at Luo Tian, looking down on him. He remembered the humiliation when Luo Tian's big foot had crushed his chest in Dahan Forest.

Luo Tian ignored Leng Yulong and Lan Yichen's angry gazes, secretly guessing who had leaked his journey down the mountain. Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu were definitely not it. After thinking back and forth, Luo Tian only suspected the Thick Earth Peak.

"Haha! Luotian, you didn't expect this, did you? The one who was once so high and mighty now has this fate!" His voice echoed like rolling thunder as Ying Hongtu appeared before them, his eyes filled with endless contempt.

"Ying Hongtu! I didn't come too late, did I?" Rong Da's face wore a smile as he arrived from the distance.

"Both of you are really cunning. Fortunately, someone informed me; otherwise I would have missed the chance to step on a prodigy!" Bai Zhantian laughed as he arrived from the distance.

Not only these three, but more figures kept appearing from the distance. They all shouted: "Luotian! Dare you fight!"

Feng Qianyu and Zhang Hongyun's faces darkened as they watched people gathering toward the governor's mansion. Although Zhang Huiyang was the city's governor and a Body-Cultivation Ninth Stage expert, he had never seen such an arrangement. His face turned pale.

"Trouble," Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu thought to themselves, their faces showing a serious expression as they looked at the people gathering toward them.

"Luotian! Dare you fight!" Twenty or so Bone-Subjugation Initial Stage youths shouted in unison, their voices reaching the heavens.

Luo Tian looked at these people. Some he recognized, some he didn't. Some had come to take revenge on him; others wanted to bring him down and gain fame. The only commonality was that they were all coming for trouble.

He sighed softly, his gaze filled with reluctance: "What do you want?"

Chapter 268: Only One Battle

Upon hearing Luo Tian's calm words, the crowd felt even more anger. When Luo Tian was in the Body-Cultivation Stage, he had always shown this indifferent gaze. Now that they were at the Bone-Subjugation Initial Stage, and Luo Tian was still at Body-Cultivation Ninth Stage, they felt he should have shown respect. Instead, this kid still maintained a calm demeanor.

Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu saw the large number of people around them, sighed inwardly. Luo Tian was still Luo Tian; even without entering the Bone-Subjugation Stage, he still attracted so much hatred. It was as if Luo Tian's body always had an aura that drew hatred. These people were the strongest batch in the Northern Region now, yet they had all come for this one Body-Cultivation Ninth Stage Luo Tian.

However, they soon relaxed. After all, Luo Tian's fame in the Body-Cultivation Stage was truly great, overshadowing everyone in the Northern Region. Some people had even developed a belief that Luo Tian was invincible. Now that Luo Tian was defeated and trapped in the Body-Cultivation Stage, they couldn't help but come to defeat this former mental obstacle and confirm their own invincibility.

"Only one battle!" Ying Hongtu shouted loudly, his face showing arrogance as he looked at the many Bone-Subjugation Initial Stage disciples.

Luo Tian's eyes coldly swept over the crowd of geniuses, like two lightning bolts slicing through their hearts.

Although Luo Tian was still at Body-Cultivation Ninth Stage, his spiritual senses comparable to Bone-Subjugation Peak made the crowd feel a chill. Clearly, they still dared not underestimate Luo Tian; his shadow in the Body-Cultivation Stage was too great.

"Your current self has no right to be arrogant!" Ying Hongtu transformed into lightning, not wanting to waste more words. He flew toward Luo Tian and launched a punch.

This punch contained Ying Hongtu's Bone-Subjugation Initial Stage cultivation. It was also his first battle after entering the Bone-Subjugation Stage.

Luo Tian smiled coldly and launched a punch in return. His cultivation instantly burst forth. At Body-Cultivation Eighth Stage, Luo Tian could already fight against Bone-Subjugation Initial Stage. Though he hadn't entered the Bone-Subjugation Stage, his strength had risen to another level. Though he didn't have confidence in a sure victory, he still had the strength to fight.

"Boom..." Two figures retreated like wind.

The onlookers were shocked, looking at Luo Tian in disbelief. Ying Hongtu's punch was fast and powerful—no Body-Cultivation Stage expert could withstand it.

But Luo Tian had merely taken a few steps back. The crowd sighed inwardly, confirming that Luo Tian was indeed Luo Tian, the strongest genius of the Body-Cultivation Stage. He was truly formidable.

Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu also showed some surprise. They had planned to intervene but received a mental transmission from Luo Tian, telling them not to act. That was why they hadn't moved.

At this moment, seeing Luo Tian withstand Ying Hongtu's punch, both of them felt a sense of regret. If Luo Tian could be this strong at Body-Cultivation Ninth Stage, how much stronger would he become after entering the Bone-Subjugation Stage?

Others watching also felt relieved, glad that this prodigy was trapped in the Body-Cultivation Stage and couldn't escape. Otherwise, in this era of rising geniuses, Luo Tian would have dominated the scene again, overshadowing everyone else.

As they thought, the two clashed again. The sound of collision kept echoing before their eyes, and the walls of the governor's mansion collapsed under the residual power.

"Boom..." Ying Hongtu retreated, his face showing a hint of surprise. He hadn't expected that even after entering the Bone-Subjugation Stage, he could still be met with a calm response from Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's proud figure appeared at the same time, his face somewhat grim. It was clear that facing Ying Hongtu wasn't as easy as people had imagined.

Ying Hongtu was at Bone-Subjugation Initial Stage, but he was definitely one of the top talents in that stage. A regular Bone-Subjugation Initial Stage expert would definitely not be a match for Ying Hongtu. Compared to the two Bone-Subjugation Midstage Sky Corpse Sect elders who had previously chased him, he was no less formidable.

"Unexpectedly, even without entering the Bone-Subjugation Stage, you're still so strong. I don't know how strong you'd be if you entered the Bone-Subjugation Stage. I believe even a Bone-Subjugation Midstage expert would be no match for you!" Ying Hongtu's face showed a sense of satisfaction. Seeing Luo Tian struggling under his blows, he felt immensely relieved.

"Take back three drops of blood. I won't trouble you anymore!" Ying Hongtu looked down, his eyes filled with a hint of mockery.

"Retaliation?" Luo Tian's cold gaze showed a hint of amusement. A chill and killing intent rose from his eyes.

"Impossible, don't push me. If I'm really forced, many prodigies have died at my hands!" Luo Tian's voice was cold like a winter wind, stirring the hearts of everyone present.

"You're still not strong enough!" Ying Hongtu's lips curled slightly, dismissing Luo Tian's words.

"Roar..." A tiger's roar echoed through Xuantian City, causing ordinary people to tremble. Though they knew the governor's mansion wasn't peaceful today and had kept their distance, this tiger's roar carried a king's aura. The common people rushed back to their homes, closing their doors tightly.

A majestic white tiger appeared before the crowd. Its black eyes carried a faint coldness, scanning over the twenty or so Bone-Subjugation Initial Stage geniuses. Its white body radiated a Bone-Subjugation Midstage aura.

Seeing the tiger, the geniuses felt a chill. They knew this tiger wasn't ordinary but didn't take it too seriously. After all, it was just a Bone-Subjugation Midstage beast; they were many and had no fear.

Indeed, Luo Tian had released the tiger. Due to the lack of vital energy in his cave space, the tiger had remained at Bone-Subjugation Initial Stage. As it came out with Luo Tian, the tiger's cultivation had skyrocketed. In just two months, it had advanced to Bone-Subjugation Initial Stage. Luo Tian knew he was currently weak and couldn't go out without some life-saving measures.

"Is this tiger enough to make me retreat? Luo Tian, you're still too small-minded!" Ying Hongtu's face showed a faint mockery.

"What? Not enough? Do you think yourself so high and mighty to insult me? I don't believe all of you would dare to attack me! If that's the case, I accept it. I'll take this fight alone today! Of course, since you've all come, don't blame me for being ruthless. If you want to bring me down, you must be ready to die!" Luo Tian's gaze swept over the crowd. His face showed an unfeeling expression.

Chapter 269: The Powerful Ying Hongtu

Hearing Luo Tian's words, the crowd felt a shadow over their hearts. They wondered what kind of confidence Luo Tian had to say such things.

But they also knew that Luo Tian was truly determined to kill. Some young strongmen who wanted to bring down Luo Tian to gain fame hesitated, for Luo Tian had truly killed other sect's prodigies.

They thought of the geniuses who had died at Luo Tian's hands. Some second-rate sects' young strongmen, including Lan Yichen and Leng Yulong, had fear. Luo Tian had killed the Xinyin Sect's Wang Siyuan and the Nanyu Yin Sect's Shangguan Hongtu, both of whom were treasures for their sects.

Luo Tian had killed them and remained unscathed. This showed that Luo Tian's background was definitely not just the Five Elements Sect.

If Luo Tian truly unleashed his strength beyond theirs, they would be killed. Their sects wouldn't dare to trouble Luo Tian after that. Especially since these people had provoked first, they couldn't really kill him. With the Sky Corpse Sect's emergence, the Five Elements Sect's Elixir Hall had also shown its terrifying strength. It was comparable to a first-rate sect.

"Last straw! Empty talk!" Ying Hongtu's face showed a hint of mockery. His lightning aura flickered.

"Boom..." A fierce aura appeared from Ying Hongtu's front, and a green humanoid puppet emerged before everyone's eyes. Its body radiated terrifying waves.

"This Bone-Subjugation Midstage puppet was a reward from my sect after I entered the Bone-Subjugation Stage. Let it play with this tiger!" Ying Hongtu spoke softly.

At the moment the green puppet appeared, Luo Tian knew it was no ordinary thing. He glanced at his white tiger, who nodded in reassurance and let out a low roar toward the puppet.

Seeing the tiger charge at the puppet, Ying Hongtu's lips slightly curved. He signaled the puppet to attack the tiger while he transformed into lightning and brandished a green long sword, continuing his assault on Luo Tian.

Luo Tian saw Ying Hongtu approaching and wore a look of seriousness. After entering Bone-Subjugation Midstage, Ying Hongtu's lightning attribute body made his speed skyrocket. Even Luo Tian's spiritual senses could barely keep up.

Luo Tian's eyes showed a hint of battle intent. He knew he couldn't escape this fight. He drew his spear and launched a move: "Golden Snake's Wild Dance."

Seeing Luo Tian use the spear technique, Ying Hongtu remained calm. The green lightning attribute vital energy covered his long sword. He slashed repeatedly, forming a lightning net to block Luo Tian's golden snake. At the same time, his body transformed into several afterimages and rushed toward Luo Tian's front, shouting: "Thousand Star Lightning Punch!"

Ying Hongtu's fists were like a meteor shower, rushing toward Luo Tian. His speed was so fast that people felt dizzy.

Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu saw Ying Hongtu's attack, their faces showing concern. Clearly, Ying Hongtu had unleashed his full strength. This kind of attack would require careful handling even for them, let alone Luo Tian at Body-Cultivation Stage.

"Too strong!" Rong Da and Bai Zhantian, watching from the side, wore expressions of seriousness. They hadn't expected Ying Hongtu to be this strong after entering the Bone-Subjugation Stage.

"This is the power of a mutated attribute, right?" Bai Zhantian looked at Ying Hongtu, who seemed like a lightning god, and said softly.

"Indeed. Though mutated attributes are single, they provide too much enhancement for the Bone-Subjugation Stage. They're far stronger than regular five attributes! Lightning attribute is naturally good at speed and explosive power. I wonder what his bone is!" Rong Da also wore a serious face, speaking slowly as he thought about how much chance he had against Ying Hongtu.

At this moment, Luo Tian was in unbearable pain. Every punch from Ying Hongtu carried immense destructive power. Though he could block most of the punches with his strong spiritual senses, some were simply impossible to dodge.

"Boom... Boom..." Countless punches landed on Luo Tian's body, causing him unbearable pain.

Knowing he couldn't keep up with this direct confrontation, Luo Tian gritted his teeth and used the "Sealing Heaven Step," instantly disappearing over a hundred feet away.

"Trying to run? Match my speed?" Ying Hongtu, seeing his punches miss, chuckled and transformed into lightning again, chasing after Luo Tian. A shadow appeared immediately in front of Luo Tian.

In the blink of an eye, three attributes within Luo Tian's body quietly activated. Blinding light like the sun rose from his body.

"Three Attributes in Harmony! Light!" Luo Tian's body radiated brilliant light, and he roared.

"Many days have passed, but you still use the same old tricks. This light won't harm me! Today I'll make you submit!" Ying Hongtu laughed arrogantly, his eyes wide with anger. He clearly didn't care about the blinding light.

"You forgot that lightning is also a form of light, right!" Ying Hongtu jumped high and launched another punch.

"Sealing Heaven Step!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. Ying Hongtu was indeed much stronger than when he was in the Body-Cultivation Stage, as if he had become a different person. He used the Sealing Heaven Step again and vanished from his spot.

"How dare you, the once arrogant five-attribute genius now just runs away?" Ying Hongtu pressed forward relentlessly, clearly not giving Luo Tian any chance to catch his breath.

"Five Attributes in Harmony, the King's Seal!" Luo Tian landed and attacked again.

"I said your old tricks are useless against me!" Ying Hongtu punched, blocking the King's Seal. His body only trembled slightly.

"Five Attributes in Harmony, Golden Snake's Wild Dance!" Luo Tian continued to use his martial arts, launching a golden dragon that roared toward Ying Hongtu.

Feeling Luo Tian's spear technique, Ying Hongtu finally stopped his movement. Among these people, only Feng Qianyu and Zhang Hongyun had encountered Luo Tian before. Though he hadn't faced this move, he had seen Luo Tian use it before. He knew how formidable the Golden Snake's Wild Dance was and wouldn't underestimate it. His arms showed exposed veins, with a continuous flow of green energy from his arm bones.

"This Luo Tian truly deserves to be the strongest in Body-Cultivation Stage. He's even forced Ying Hongtu to use his bone!" Rong Da wore a puzzled expression.

At this moment, Ying Hongtu's entire arm was covered in lightning. He held a long sword and slashed it fiercely toward the golden dragon.

"Roar..." The golden dragon was split in two by the powerful lightning sword and dispersed into the air.

"Seal Soul, Capture!" Luo Tian's heart trembled. Ying Hongtu had become so strong that he could now use his strongest martial arts.

Chapter 270: Luo Tian's Defeat?

Ying Hongtu had just split the golden dragon in two when he heard Luo Tian's cold voice. His eyes became even more serious. He feared Luo Tian's spiritual sense martial arts the most, but now that he had entered Bone-Subjugation Initial Stage, his spiritual senses had reached the Spiritual Awareness Initial Stage. Still, he couldn't underestimate Luo Tian's spiritual sense martial arts. After all, even those at Spiritual Awareness Late Stage in the cave space had been tricked by Luo Tian.

He activated his spiritual senses, forming a spiritual sense long sword and slashing it fiercely.

"Boom..." A deep sound echoed in people's ears. The Five Elements' waves spread out.

The Soul-Capture Seal carried a wild aura and collided with the long sword. However, it made Ying Hongtu shocked. His spiritual sense long sword was shattered into fragments in an instant and didn't even last a breath.

"Damn, how strong is his spiritual sense!" Ying Hongtu dodged.

"You! You can't escape!" Luo Tian's lips slightly curled. His spiritual sense controlled the Soul-Capture Seal and chased after Ying Hongtu.

Even if Ying Hongtu was fast, he couldn't escape spiritual senses. In an instant, Ying Hongtu was hit by the Soul-Capture Seal.

Fortunately, Ying Hongtu wasn't struck in the head but on his back while running.

"Pu..." Even so, Ying Hongtu spat out blood and took a few steps back.

Luo Tian wouldn't miss this opportunity. He knew if he gave Ying Hongtu a chance to breathe, the result would be Ying Hongtu's relentless attacks.

He kicked off the ground and appeared in the sky, launching the Soul-Subduing Cauldron with terrifying pressure toward Ying Hongtu.

Releasing the Soul-Subduing Cauldron meant Luo Tian had decided to kill Ying Hongtu. If Ying Hongtu was struck by the Soul-Subduing Cauldron, he would have no chance of survival.

"What is this cauldron!" People's faces showed fear as they watched the Soul-Subduing Cauldron briefly appear in the sky. Bai Zhantian and Rong Da had seen the Soul-Subduing Cauldron before. They also knew its terrifying gravity. Even with five people's strength, they hadn't been able to lift it. One could imagine the possibility of survival if struck by this heavy cauldron.

Others watched Luo Tian with serious expressions. Though they considered themselves geniuses, seeing Luo Tian's endless strategies made them feel a wave of shock.

Miao Dapeng, who had previously boasted about capturing Luo Tian, felt fear. He secretly thanked himself for not attacking Luo Tian earlier; if he had, he would have died in a very painful way.

Zhang Huiyang watched Luo Tian with a glowing face, muttering: "Is this the strongest genius of the Five Elements Sect? Today I've truly seen something amazing!"

As he thought, the heavy cauldron landed on the ground with a deep sound. Luo Tian also landed on the ground, his eyes flashing coldly as he looked at the crowd.

"Dead?" Bai Zhantian furrowed his brows, watching the faint green energy beneath the Soul-Subduing Cauldron.

"Impossible!" The Bone-Subjugation Initial Stage disciple accompanying Ying Hongtu wore a look of intense disbelief.

"Can't be dead, can he? He's Ying Hongtu, a prodigy of the Thunder Sect, just entered Bone-Subjugation Stage. He hasn't even shown his strength yet and is dead at the hands of a Body-Cultivation Ninth Stage Luo Tian?" Lan Yichen, Leng Yulong, and others were puzzled.

Luo Tian's serious gaze looked at the green energy beneath the Soul-Subduing Cauldron. According to logic, if struck by it, Ying Hongtu would definitely be dead. But Luo Tian's heart couldn't believe that Ying Hongtu had died so easily.

However, the green energy beneath the Soul-Subduing Cauldron was clearly Ying Hongtu's lightning attribute energy. This made Luo Tian even more puzzled.

He sighed and didn't think further. He walked toward the Soul-Subduing Cauldron to retrieve it, and then he would know.

"This bronze cauldron! It's definitely a good item. If I hadn't run fast, I would have been caught here!" Ying Hongtu's voice echoed in people's ears.

Luo Tian heard this voice and was shocked. He immediately jumped back.

"Now you want to run, it's too late!" Ying Hongtu's voice hadn't finished when a green lightning dragon appeared on Luo Tian's chest.

"Pu..." Luo Tian had no time to react. His body flew out like a broken kite, coughing blood.

Ying Hongtu wore a look of satisfaction as he appeared in people's sight. He looked at Luo Tian, who had been thrown out ten feet away, and laughed loudly.

Defeating Luo Tian allowed him to release the long-held resentment. He could imagine that from now on, his name Ying Hongtu would replace Luo Tian's in the sects across the Northern Region.

People saw Ying Hongtu laughing loudly and felt fear. Even Rong Da and Bai Zhantian were serious, their eyes filled with strong apprehension.

At this moment, no one paid attention to Luo Tian. Only Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu rushed toward him.

Seeing the two figures of Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu, people turned their attention to Luo Tian. They sighed inwardly that a prodigy had dimmed so quickly. Though Luo Tian was still formidable, they knew that as this group entered the Bone-Subjugation Midstage, Luo Tian's name would gradually fade from the Northern Region and become unknown.

On the other hand, Bai Hu and the puppet's battle had reached a boiling point. Though the puppet was made of unknown metal, Bai Hu's sharp teeth also caused it great pain. The only advantage the puppet had was that it didn't feel pain and kept attacking relentlessly.

Looking at the stalemate between Bai Hu and the puppet, Ying Hongtu didn't care. He slowly approached Luo Tian, who was lying there, to take three drops of blood and complete this mission.

Seeing Ying Hongtu approach Luo Tian, Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu, who had just arrived at Luo Tian's side, looked like they were facing a threat. They hadn't even had time to help Luo Tian up before they flashed in front of Ying Hongtu.

"You've already lost. What else do you want?" Zhang Hongyun's deep voice echoed.

"Back then, in a relic site, he took three drops of my blood. Now I just want to do the same thing!" Ying Hongtu saw the two blocking his path and a hint of fear in his eyes.

Ying Hongtu could clearly feel the strength radiating from their bodies. Compared to Luo Tian, they were much stronger.

"With us here, you won't get it!" Feng Qianyu's eyes showed hatred as he growled at Ying Hongtu. A blue and red energy surrounded his body.

Zhang Hongyun also fully prepared to face Ying Hongtu, with golden and green energy swirling in his hands.

Chapter 271: The Appearance of Dragon Baby

Feeling the strong energy and fierce battle intent from Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu, Ying Hongtu slowly spoke: "Since you're seeking death, I won't mind making the two of you into the same state as him!"

"What? Ying Hongtu is challenging two dual-attribute geniuses!" Several Bone-Subjugation Initial Stage disciples watching felt tremors.

"He's too arrogant!" Bai Zhantian wore a hint of mockery on his face.

"If I'm not mistaken, he wants to replace Luo Tian's position among the young geniuses. Didn't Luo Tian once fight two at a time in Dahan Forest?" Rong Da wore a smile, clearly thinking Ying Hongtu was overconfident.

"Arrogant!" Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu's eyes showed anger. They were also top geniuses of the era, yet they had been looked down upon by Ying Hongtu.

"I'll see what talent your Thunder Sect's genius has!" Zhang Hongyun didn't want to waste words. His body's dual-attribute energy surged.

"Buzz..." Just as Zhang Hongyun was about to attack, a powerful vital energy wave rose behind him, emitting an ear-piercing hum.
