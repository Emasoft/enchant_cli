"Damned!" Luo Tian stepped into the treasure vault, his entire body momentarily stunned. The vast treasure vault was completely empty, with only a few thousand weapons placed there. Though the number was considerable, to Luo Tian they were all akin to trash; not even a single celestial-grade weapon existed, let alone a sacred artifact.

Luo Tian was utterly speechless. He hadn't expected Shen Gongfu to be so stingy. He let out a long sigh, intending to leave, but then Luo Tian suddenly halted his steps and turned around. His purple eyes swept across the weapon racks.

Chapter 1260: Reencountering a Fragment of the Book of Epochs

"Book of Epochs!"

The Book of Epochs within Luo Tian's mind emitted a continuous hum, sending out waves of energy that made Luo Tian stop in his tracks. He turned to gaze at the weapon racks.

His purple eyes swept across the weapon racks and instantly spotted a golden sheet of paper on one of them. However, this golden sheet was corroded with rust, causing Luo Tian's brows to furrow slightly.

Luo Tian's heart thudded erratically. He reached out and took the golden page into his hand. At first glance, it was nothing more than an ordinary gold sheet—completely unlike the grand and awe-inspiring Book of Epochs he had envisioned.

"What is this rust? How could it corrode the Book of Epochs itself?" Luo Tian pondered in confusion.

"Usually, when I encountered fragments of the Book of Epochs, this fellow would automatically come out to retrieve it. Now, however, it only trembled without appearing. It must be due to this rust—afraid or unwilling to retrieve it?" Luo Tian's thoughts were filled with confusion.

Yet, his heart was still exhilarated. Acquiring this fragment of the Book of Epochs had been beyond his expectations. Simply encountering the Book of Epochs made this trip to the treasure vault worthwhile.

"Island Master, it seems your calculations were wrong. This fragment of the Book of Epochs is surely more precious than a counterfeit Book of Epochs, perhaps even comparable to an authentic one!" Luo Tian mused with a smile. If he hadn't been the master of the Book of Epochs himself, he might never have noticed this golden book's uniqueness.

"How should I remove this rust?" Luo Tian then pondered, not rushing to leave the treasure vault but instead deep in thought.

"Something capable of corroding the Book of Epochs must not be simple. I need to find the right method," Luo Tian mused for a while but could not come up with an answer. He then slowly stepped out of the treasure vault.

"How did it go, Deputy Island Master? Did you find a suitable weapon?" Shen Gongfu had been waiting outside, his face twisted in a sly grin as he addressed Luo Tian.

"Island Master, I'm truly ashamed. I hadn't expected Third Island to be so impoverished. I feel reluctant to take this piece of trash, but those earth-grade weapons were simply too unappealing for me," Luo Tian shook his head gently, his eyes filled with disappointment.

"Alas, it's my own incompetence as an island master," Shen Gongfu didn't even glance at the fragment of the Book of Epochs in Luo Tian's hand, sighing softly.

"Then please lead me to the inheritance site of Third Island. If I obtain the inheritance, I will surely elevate Third Island!" Luo Tian spoke with determination.

"Good. Having someone like you in Third Island is truly a blessing for it," Shen Gongfu's face bore an air of satisfaction as he nodded in agreement.

Each harboring their own thoughts, the two arrived at a cliff. The entire cliff was smooth as glass, like a mirror.

"This is it!" Shen Gongfu smiled, gazing at the towering cliff as he addressed Luo Tian.

"Hmm," Luo Tian looked at the smooth, glass-like cliff and furrowed his brows slightly. Though he could sense that this cliff was extraordinary, it exuded strange energy, leaving him puzzled.

"It's said that upon this cliff lies a martial technique. Once mastered, all weapons and treasures in the world would be as nothing! It was left by the first Third Island Master," Shen Gongfu said with a sigh, his gaze on the smooth cliff wall, eyes filled with reverence.

"Hope you're lucky! For the next three months until heading to the Sea of the Edge, you may meditate here," Shen Gongfu continued. After saying this, he turned and left.

"This... damned difficult!" Luo Tian looked at the smooth cliff wall and leapt upward, instantly appearing in the center of the cliff. His feet touched the rock.

"Buzz..." As soon as Luo Tian stepped onto the rock, a strange wave of energy surged beneath his feet, causing him to slide off the cliff and land on the ground.

"What was that?" Luo Tian felt this strange wave of energy, his eyes filled with confusion. Then they gleamed with sharpness.

Because in that moment of stepping onto the cliff, Luo Tian had a fleeting sense of its extraordinariness.

"Let me try!" Thinking this, Luo Tian immediately sat cross-legged beneath the cliff wall. He pressed his hand against the smooth surface and began to meditate.

As Luo Tian's hand touched the cliff wall, a surge of Daoic resonance erupted. The same force that had sent him sliding off the cliff surged over him again.

Then Luo Tian began to meditate earnestly, losing track of time. His entire body was like a statue as he sat there.

Time passed slowly, and Luo Tian's figure vanished from the sight of Third Island people. The people of Third Island were all curious about where their deputy island master had gone.

However, soon after, Shen Gongfei rushed to inquire about Luo Tian's whereabouts from Shen Gongfu and learned that he had gone to the inheritance site of Third Island, meditating on its inheritance.

This news spread and caused another stir across Third Island. It became a topic of discussion again.

"Did we ever succeed in meditating on Third Island's inheritance?" people murmured among themselves.

"Yes, I remember Hu Tianzong once meditated for a full year but still couldn't grasp it. That shows how difficult Third Island's inheritance must be!" people chattered, all doubting Luo Tian could succeed in meditating on Third Island's inheritance. After all, no one had ever succeeded before.

"Truly bold!" Hu Tianzong sat in his room, a mocking expression on his face as he heard the news of Luo Tian meditating on the inheritance.

Hu Tianzong had once meditated on that cliff wall and spent a considerable time without grasping anything useful. He didn't believe Luo Tian could succeed in three months, thinking it was simply a waste of time.

Three months passed swiftly. Luo Tian's meditation on the inheritance seemed to be forgotten by people, as another major event occurred at the Seven Star Island—The opening of the Sea of the Edge.

The Sea of the Edge was a battlefield between humans and barbarians. It wasn't just a battlefield but also a place to vie for resources, as the Sea of the Edge contained an Yuan Spirit Vein. The entire barbarian continent was barren, but the Sea of the Edge was an exception, rich in resources—especially its Yuan Spirit Vein, which surpassed that of the barbarian continent by a great deal.

The Sea of the Edge was also filled with fierce battles. It opened once every ten years, for a month. Previously, Yang Jinghua had gone alone each time, staying there for a month before returning with resources collected by the disciples and bringing them back to Seven Star Island.

The people of Seven Star Island knew that this time it wasn't just Yang Jinghua alone. To treat Guan Xingjian, Luo Tian and Hu Tianzong also went together, which excited the people of Seven Star Island.

"Three top talents going to the Sea of the Edge. I suppose this time they'll surely gain much!" The people of Seven Star Island gathered beneath the Seven Star Terrace, looking up at Yang Jinghua and Hu Tianzong on the Observation Star Platform with reverence.

"Where is Luo Tian?" Seven island masters looked at Shen Gongfu, their faces filled with confusion.

"Maybe he's afraid and didn't come!" Hu Tianzong sneered, his eyes filled with contempt as he mocked.

"Hu Tianzong, once you reach the Sea of the Edge, I hope your sharp tongue still works!" Yang Jinghua coldly snorted.

"I'll go get him!" Shen Gongfu smiled and strode toward the inheritance site, knowing Luo Tian had likely failed.

"Boom..." As Shen Gongfu took his first step, a clear bell sound rang out. The faces of the seven island masters changed abruptly.

"This is the Seven Star Bell!" Tong Yangjian exclaimed in disbelief, realizing what this bell sound signified.

"The ringing of the Seven Star Bell means that someone has obtained an island's inheritance!" Feng Yong's eyes gleamed with excitement, his gaze turning toward Third Island.

These past few days, they had heard about Luo Tian's meditation on Third Island's inheritance. They didn't believe he could succeed either.

Each of the Seven Star Islands had an inheritance. Other islands' inheritances had been successfully grasped by people over the years, but only First and Third Islands' inheritances remained unachieved.

"How could this be!" Hu Tianzong's eyes widened in disbelief, gazing toward Third Island. He had meditated for a full year without grasping anything, eventually mastering the Instant Movement Technique on Second Island.

"What is Third Island's inheritance?" People were all curious, gazing toward Third Island, waiting for Luo Tian to appear.

"This..." Shen Gongfu was truly at a loss. He felt he had made a mistake, thinking if he had known Luo Tian could succeed, he would have asked for more Yuan Qi Stones!

"Buzz..." The bell's sound faded, and a series of resonant waves filled people's ears. A burst of light erupted.

"What's going on? Why is my Xuan Yue Sword trembling!" One of the First Island disciples exclaimed, grabbing his sword as if it might fly from his hand at any moment.

Not only this disciple, but all the disciples of Seven Star Island's weapons trembled as well, emitting waves of light in their masters' hands. They seemed ready to break free at any moment.

"It's the Eight Directions Plundering Technique!" Tong Yangjian said softly, his voice filled with envy.

"It's the ultimate technique of the Third Island Master. It was left in such a form!" Feng Yong sighed softly.

"It's said that the Third Island Master once used this Eight Directions Plundering Technique to resist a Book of Epochs. I wonder if it's true!" The Fifth Island Master spoke, recalling the records in Seven Star Island's ancient texts about the terrifying nature of the Eight Directions Plundering Technique.

The weapons' humming lasted for a full hour before calming down, their brilliance dimming. At the same time, Luo Tian's figure appeared in people's sight.

"Sorry for making you wait!" Luo Tian smiled as he appeared before the crowd.

Chapter 1261: Entering the Sea of the Edge

On the Observation Star Platform, Luo Tian slowly descended before everyone, a slight smile on his face as he stood beside Yang Jinghua.

"Luo Tian, did you obtain the Eight Directions Plundering Technique?" Tong Yangjian asked, though he already believed it, but still voiced the question that was on everyone's mind.

"Sort of," Luo Tian nodded gently. At this moment, he felt a deep admiration. All the weapons in Seven Star Island seemed to have some kind of connection with him, as if they were bound by an unseen force. Any weapon not a counterfeit Book of Epochs could be controlled entirely by him if he wished.

"Unbelievable! How did you do it!" The crowd below the Observation Star Platform was stunned, their eyes filled with disbelief as they gazed at Luo Tian.

"Meditated on it!" Luo Tian shook his head gently, not explaining much. In truth, he didn't know how he had achieved it; he just knew that after fully understanding this power, he had reached this state.

"Can you let us see it?" Tong Yangjian asked, his eyes filled with hope, wanting to witness the power of the Eight Directions Plundering Technique.

"Okay!" Luo Tian nodded at their curiosity and extended his hand.

"Buzz..." Immediately, a hum filled the air. A series of divine beams shot up from beneath the Observation Star Platform. Various weapons, each with different shapes, instantly flew out of their owners' hands, breaking free from their original masters and circling above Luo Tian's head, forming a long dragon of weapons.

"This!" People were stunned, their eyes filled with awe as they gazed at Luo Tian. They couldn't believe there was such a technique in the world that could control others' weapons.

Luo Tian felt it was enough. He pressed his hand into the air, and the weapons glowed again before returning to the hands of Seven Star Island's disciples.

"Powerful!" People looked at Luo Tian, thinking about how terrifying it would be if their weapons were suddenly used against them in a battle.

"Indeed, you're incredibly fortunate!" Tong Yangjian and other island masters sighed, looking at Luo Tian who stood calm.

"How do you think everyone else is?" Yang Jinghua stood beside Hu Tianzong, speaking in a low voice with contempt.

Hearing Yang Jinghua's mockery, Hu Tianzong's face darkened. He had just mocked Luo Tian for not succeeding in meditation, but now Luo Tian had given him a harsh slap with reality.

"Alright, it's good that Luo Tian has grown stronger. Do you need anything else? If not, we'll activate the teleportation array!" Tong Yangjian asked Luo Tian.

"No preparations needed!" Luo Tian shook his head, indicating he was ready to leave anytime.

"Big Island Master, I have a request. Could you add one more person?" Just as they were about to teleport, Shen Gongfu's voice rang out.

"Add another person?" Upon hearing Shen Gongfu's words, everyone's brows furrowed. The Sea of the Edge was no different from Seven Star Island; it was a battlefield where life and death were common.

"I want to send my unworthy nephew for training!" Shen Gongfu scanned the crowd, addressing Tong Yangjian.

"What?" Shen Gongfei in the crowd felt a chill and then stealthily squeezed his way out of the group.

"Shen Gongfei?" People looked at him with confusion, surprised that Shen Gongfu would make such a request.

Shen Gongfei was not unfamiliar to people; he was the nephew of Third Island Master Shen Gongfu. Especially in recent days, his close relationship with Luo Tian had made people's impressions of him even deeper.

"Hey kid, where are you going?" Shen Gongfu saw Shen Gongfei desperately squeezing his way out of the crowd and coldly snorted. He flashed forward, instantly appearing beside Shen Gongfei and grabbing his large body, lifting both of them into the sky.

"Uncle! What did I do to offend you? I don't want to go! The people in the Sea of the Edge are too fierce. You're trying to murder your own nephew!" Shen Gongfei cried out loudly, looking at Shen Gongfu with a face of委屈.

"Rubbish! You've been idling around here at Seven Star Island all this time. It's time to go out and train! If I don't raise you properly, I won't be able to live with myself after my late brother's death. You never entered the Saint Stage before, your strength wasn't enough. Now, your good days are over!" Shen Gongfu kicked Shen Gongfei's round butt and sent him flying onto the Observation Star Platform.

"This..." Tong Yangjian was hesitant, looking at Yang Jinghua with a questioning gaze.

"Hmph. Island Master, I'm going to find the Immortal-Reviving Herb, not for training. If we have such a burden, I can't take care of it!" Hu Tianzong sneered at Shen Gongfei.

"I'm not sending him to accompany you to find the Immortal-Reviving Herb, but to train in the battlefield. Don't worry, it won't affect you!" Shen Gongfu saw Hu Tianzong's expression of disgust and his own face turned cold, for the first time losing his smile.

"Yang Jinghua, do you think it's okay?" Shen Gongfei turned to Yang Jinghua, his voice filled with inquiry.

"I have no problem. But once we enter the Sea of the Edge, everything must follow my rules. I won't be lenient!" Yang Jinghua patted Shen Gongfei's fat shoulder, looking at him.

"I don't want to go! You're my uncle, I'll give you all my savings. Please let me off!" Shen Gongfei, who had a natural fear of Yang Jinghua, felt more intense than with Hu Tianzong. Seeing Yang Jinghua looking at him, Shen Gongfei trembled and cried out loudly.

"Deputy Island Master! My beloved Deputy Island Master, please speak up for me!" Shen Gongfei saw Luo Tian and felt like a savior.

Luo Tian looked at Shen Gongfei, who was screaming like a pig. It was family matters between uncle and nephew; he didn't dare to speak.

"Don't worry, I'll take care of it!" Luo Tian shook his head gently, a look of comfort on his face as he patted Shen Gongfei's shoulder.

"Hey, I didn't expect you to have savings!" Shen Gongfu focused on the words "savings" and grabbed Shen Gongfei's storage bag, taking it from his waist.

"Good job. You've saved so many Yuan Qi Stones. I'll keep it for you this time, and when you come out, I'll return it to you!" Shen Gongfu smiled, quickly putting the storage bag into his pocket.

"Are you my uncle?" Shen Gongfei's face looked like a withered eggplant, his eyes filled with委屈.

"Stop talking nonsense. Let's go! Yang Jinghua, I'll leave it to you!" Shen Gongfu addressed Yang Jinghua.

"Alright, let's go!" Tong Yangjian smiled, looking at the four people on the Observation Star Platform. Feng Yong and others also slowly flew into the sky.

"Ready!" Tong Yangjian reminded, extending his hand. The power of the Book of Epochs surged out, flowing across the Observation Star Platform. Seven long dragons flew from each island master's hands, filling the platform's patterns with a massive teleportation force that instantly enveloped Luo Tian and others.

"Uncle, when I come back, you must return my storage bag! Deputy Island Master, Yang Senior Brother, once we reach the Sea of the Edge, you must protect me!" Shen Gongfu's voice gradually faded. Luo Tian and others' figures disappeared from people's sight.

"You're just like you, greedy for money!" The Fourth Island Master looked at Shen Gongfu with disbelief.

"There's nothing I can do; saving money is our family tradition!" Shen Gongfu didn't catch the sarcasm in the Fourth Island Master's words but instead felt proud, leaving people speechless.

"Hope everything goes smoothly!" Tong Yangjian sighed softly and vanished from the Observation Star Platform.

"Buzz..." The hum echoed, and Luo Tian and three others landed on a high platform. As soon as they steadied themselves, a thunderous roar echoed in their ears.

The roar was deafening, filled with battle spirit. A blood-scented atmosphere instantly enveloped the four of them, causing Shen Gongfei's face to pale immediately.

"Greetings for the Great Commander's return!" A low voice echoed in their ears, making Luo Tian's gaze flicker slightly.

In view, a group of figures stood beneath the platform, gazing at it with intense eyes.

"Elite!" Luo Tian thought of these two words the moment he saw them, gazing at the people beneath the platform with a slight admiration.

"Welcome to the Sea of the Edge!" Yang Jinghua addressed Luo Tian and the others, at the same time stepping forward to the front of the three, a smile on his face as he looked at the people beneath the platform.

"Brothers, I'm back!" Yang Jinghua smiled and shouted to the people around him, as if he had changed.

"Interesting!" Luo Tian's eyes were filled with curiosity. His purple eyes scanned the distance, sensing something unusual about this world.

The entire world was bathed in a blood-red sun hanging in the sky, turning the whole world into dark red.

The scent of blood was overwhelming, making Luo Tian marvel. This was indeed a natural battlefield. He could feel that if they fought each other, the blood-scented atmosphere would affect some people's minds, stimulating their potential in battle.

"Great Commander, why are there four of you this time? Usually it's just you!" As Luo Tian marveled, a robust figure flew onto the platform. His cultivation was at the peak of Saint Stage. His eyes scanned Luo Tian and the others.

"You're Hu Tianzong Senior Brother?" The disciple immediately recognized Hu Tianzong, his eyes filled with surprise. He hadn't expected Hu Tianzong to come to the Sea of the Edge.

"Yes!" Hu Tianzong nodded gently, not showing excessive arrogance. He knew these disciples of the Sea of the Edge were admirable.

"Rustle..." The sound of waves echoed, drawing Luo Tian's attention behind him. Blood-red waves crashed onto the platform, producing a series of sounds.

"This is our rear—the endless blood sea. No one knows why the entire water turned red. Some say it was an ancient battlefield, where humans and the Great Ancient Tribes fought fiercely, blood dyeing the sea," Yang Jinghua introduced to Luo Tian.

"This blood sea isn't harmful. There are no creatures in it, only a slight corrosiveness. It's harmless to super-advanced cultivators. Also, we can't control it! Let's go; I'll lead you to our base first!" Yang Jinghua took flight, gazing at a black mountain in the distance and taking off.

"Too fierce. This place doesn't seem like a good one at all!" Shen Gongfei hid behind Luo Tian, his plump body trembling slightly. He felt as if he had fallen from heaven to hell.

"Don't worry, Yang Senior Brother will take care of you!" Luo Tian smiled and patted Shen Gongfei's shoulder, then took flight after Yang Jinghua toward the black mountain.

Numerous figures with powerful auras also took to the sky, forming streaks of light but still remaining orderly behind Yang Jinghua as they flew toward the mountain.

Luo Tian felt the order of the people behind him and nodded in approval. Yang Jinghua was truly deserving of his position as commander; this level of order wasn't achievable for just anyone.

After a quarter of an hour, the group reached the black mountain. Yang Jinghua led Luo Tian and the others into a large hall.

"This is where our Seven Star Island is stationed. It's somewhat simple, and life isn't very convenient here. Please forgive us!" Yang Jinghua instructed Xiang Shaochuan, preparing a feast.

"I'm the boss here, with absolute authority. Even if the Great Island Master came, these people might not listen to him!" Yang Jinghua's eyes showed rare pride as he spoke to Luo Tian.

"Everyone here is quite bold, with a straightforward and rough nature. They believe in fists!" Yang Jinghua spoke to Luo Tian, actually introducing it for Shen Gongfei since he was the one staying here.

"Fists? I hate fighting!" Shen Gongfei's face showed bitterness, his whole body deflating like a deflated balloon.

"Your uncle is doing this for your good. Seven Star Island may seem stable now, but no one knows when the barbarians will launch a major attack. We must be prepared for danger!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, understanding Shen Gongfu's intention.

During these days of coexistence, Luo Tian had fully understood Shen Gongfei's personality. He was a coward who feared death. This kind of nature was acceptable in times of peace, but on the barbarian continent, how could the barbarians tolerate Seven Star Island's existence? It was just a matter of time before they attacked. Shen Gongfei's nature needed to change, and the Sea of the Edge was the best trial ground for him to grow quickly.

"Don't let your uncle down!" Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Shen Gongfei.

"Yes!" Perhaps Shen Gongfu's words weren't listened to, but Luo Tian's would be. Sometimes people were strange like that.

"Senior Yang, tell me what to do!" Shen Gongfei said with a hint of determination, addressing Yang Jinghua.

"Oh?" Yang Jinghua looked at Shen Gongfei with a playful gaze, then spoke gently: "Since you said that, I won't be polite!"

"Shaocuan, go! Take him out and treat him as ordinary disciples. No, more strict than ordinary disciples!" Yang Jinghua told Xiang Shaocuan.

"Yes!" Xiang Shaocuan quickly stood up, his eyes filled with pity as he looked at Shen Gongfei before heading out.

"Um... Senior Yang, don't be so harsh! You could let up a bit!" Shen Gongfei spoke softly, watching Xiang Shaocuan leave. His heart started to drum.

"Remember, here I am the one who decides everything. Even if I'm wrong, you must do it! If I told you to die, you'd have to!" Yang Jinghua coldly spoke, forming a unique aura of command from leading thousands of troops.

"A common soldier, no qualification to sit with us!" Yang Jinghua said and then kicked Shen Gongfei's butt, sending him flying out.

"It seems this kid will slim down!" Luo Tian shook his head gently, his mouth twitching. The aura Yang Jinghua had just shown was even surprising to him.

"We have ten thousand disciples in the Sea of the Edge. The weakest among them is at the super-advanced stage. You've seen their strength, which isn't comparable to ordinary super-advanced disciples. In the same level, they can easily fight two opponents and escape," Yang Jinghua spoke with a special expression when talking about the elite disciples of the Sea of the Edge.

"We have an understanding with the barbarians. Normally, there are minor skirmishes, but every ten years when the Sea of the Edge opens, we start to vie for resources!" Yang Jinghua's face was filled with battle spirit as he introduced this to Luo Tian.

"Enough talk. Let's find the place marked on that fragment first; there might be unexpected things!" Hu Tianzong, looking impatient, addressed Luo Tian.

"If my guess is correct, the place marked on that fragment is the Heaven-Disrupting Mountains!" Yang Jinghua pointed to the location marked on the map, addressing Luo Tian. He had treated Hu Tianzong as if he wasn't there from the beginning.

"Heaven-Disrupting Mountains!" Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly, seeing that it was close to where the barbarians were stationed.

"Yes. So you must be careful not to meet the barbarians, because I don't know who the top disciples of the Barbarian God's Temple are this time!" Yang Jinghua looked worried, giving a warning.

"Okay. Don't worry; we'll be careful. If it's not the early era of the Book of Epochs, with our two strengths, I think we have some confidence. What worries me most is the danger in the Heaven-Disrupting Mountains. Even if it's only appeared before, it mustn't be simple!" Luo Tian's face was serious.

After discussing further, Luo Tian and Hu Tianzong left the base and headed toward the Heaven-Disrupting Mountains.

As soon as Luo Tian and Hu Tianzong left the human base, in the barbarian territory, a group of massive figures stood on a high platform waiting for the arrival of the Barbarian God's Temple's top disciples.

"Buzz..." Waves spread, and ten massive figures appeared in the sight of many barbarians.

"The top disciples of the Barbarian God's Temple have arrived!" The massive barbarians showed a slight respect, gazing at the ten figures on the platform.

"Wait, there's someone else!" Soon after, people saw a few more figures appear beside the ten top disciples. Their eyes showed surprise.

"Blood Clan, Feather Clan, Star-Moon Divine Clan..." The barbarians recognized a few of the figures' races, though they were much smaller than themselves.

"What's going on? The top disciples of the Ancient Kings have arrived?" The barbarian warriors were confused but still bowed to the ten top disciples.

"This is the Sea of the Edge?" A young man with six white wings rising behind him looked curious, scanning the blood-red sky.

"Only your barbarian continent still has humans left. You need us to help you solve it? Is the barbarian's strength not good enough anymore?" A young man in a blood-red robe licked his lips lightly, smiling with a sinister grin. His silver fangs protruded from his mouth.

"Barbarian Soul, let's go. This battlefield isn't meaningful for us. With these few of us, it should be enough! Our goal is to find the Immortal-Reviving Herb, the Purple Apex Divine Lotus!" A young man who looked like a human spoke to the leader of the barbarian giant.

"Yes," The barbarian giant called Barbarian Soul nodded gently and ordered: "You nine stay here to organize the battlefield. I think this time humans are unprepared, so it shouldn't be a problem. I'll go meet them!"

"First, let's clarify: if we find the Purple Apex Divine Lotus, we'll each do it on our own!" The feather clan's young man spoke, his eyes filled with a smile as he looked around at the others.

"Hmph. Afraid of you?" The blood clan's young man had a cold expression, speaking softly. If Luo Tian were present, he would surely recognize this young man—this was the blood clan's prince, Tu Feiyang, who had once competed with him for the Feathered Immortal Scripture in the Dragon Fall Valley.

"Let's go. First, let's find it and then kill all humans in the Sea of the Edge. I haven't tasted human blood for a long time!" Tu Feiyang's face was cold as he spoke to the others.

Four figures, with astonishing power, disappeared from people's sight. Nine massive figures remained behind.

"Barbarian River, do you think that human Guan Xingjian will come? I suppose he's already dead!" A barbarian giant with muscles and a white bone club on his back spoke.

"Alas... maybe," Barbarian River and Barbarian Sea sighed, responding softly.

Chapter 1263: Heaven-Disrupting Mountains

The blood-red earth, the blood-red sky, and the blood-red mountains. Each mountain stood up from the ground without a peak,整齐 as if cut by something, forming continuous mountains. There were no plants in the mountain ranges.

Two figures appeared in the mountains above the sky, their faces filled with admiration as they gazed at the blood-red mountains and walked quickly through them.

"Airspace Prohibition!" As soon as Luo Tian and Hu Tianzong arrived at the Heaven-Disrupting Mountains, they were forcibly pulled down from the sky by an unseen force. They couldn't fly.

They had no choice but to walk, which delayed their journey and made them a bit frustrated. A month was neither long nor short, so they didn't want to waste too much time on the way. Despite not being able to fly, their speed was still fast as they headed toward the direction of the broken map's lotus.

"Buzz..." As the two walked through the mountains, four clan top disciples also appeared outside the mountains. Their brows furrowed slightly.

"Someone got here before us?" Barbarian Soul spoke, his voice like thunder. He gazed at the mountains with a cold expression.

"I sensed human energy!" Tu Feiyang's crimson eyes showed brutality, gazing into the mountains.

"Speed seems fast!" The Star-Moon Divine Clan's genius, Fu Xingyue, closed his eyes and sensed for a moment before speaking.

"It's two humans. Their speed is fast!" The feather clan's genius, Fan Jingyu, had a golden eye open on his forehead. He gazed into the distance as if he could see Luo Tian and Hu Tianzong walking.

"Let's go. Don't let the little bugs take it first!" Barbarian Soul spoke, his voice cold. His massive body took a step forward and chased after Luo Tian and Hu Tianzong.

"Someone!" At the moment they chased, Luo Tian's vast spiritual sense instantly sensed their presence. His face slightly tensed.

"It's him!" Luo Tian felt the figure of Tu Feiyang in his spiritual sense and looked at it with a serious expression.

"Back with wings? Feather Clan?" He then sensed the other three's special features.

Luo Tian was no longer that naive boy who had just arrived at the barbarian continent. He understood some of the Great Ancient Tribes, especially the top clans.

"If I'm not mistaken, that handsome young man is the Star-Moon Divine Clan!" Luo Tian thought with a serious mind.

"Tu Feiyang's position in the Blood Clan must be high. Being able to walk alongside Tu Feiyang, the other clan's top disciples must not be simple!" He guessed and felt a bad premonition.

"What's wrong?" Hu Tianzong sensed the change in Luo Tian's aura and asked.

"Perhaps a fierce battle is coming!" Luo Tian extended his hand, transmitting the image in his spiritual sense into Hu Tianzong's mind.
