When Luotian first arrived at the Star Moon Divine Clan, he was merely a step toward the era. In an instant, these few had grown to match their cultivation levels.

" This world no longer belongs to us!" The two sighed long and deep. Though they had the potential to become a pseudo-king, it was uncertain how long it would take.

"I want you dead!" As everyone marveled, a voice filled with resentment echoed through the starry void. Fu Tu, who had just recovered slightly, wore a sinister expression and glared at Luotian with venomous eyes.

As Fu Tu's words fell, the Star Moon Divine Spear hovering above Fu Xingxuan and others' heads emitted a mournful sound before vanishing instantly from their heads.

"嗡……" The humming reverberated, and waves of divine laws surged before Fu Tu. The resplendent Star Moon Divine Spear appeared above his head, radiating an overwhelming aura accompanied by Fu Tu's hidden killing intent. Everyone's hearts trembled slightly.

"Unexpected, I still had one last ace—Royal Weapon, the Star Moon Divine Spear!" Fu Tu sneered with intense hatred. He had been born into an invincible existence, but his first battle was crushed by Luotian. This hatred toward Luotian had become overwhelming.

"Fu Tu, don't be reckless!" Furenbin and others watched the Star Moon Divine Spear radiating boundless divine light, their expressions instantly changed.

"Damn it!" Fu Xingxuan's face turned grim as he desperately tried to stop Fu Tu from activating the Star Moon Divine Spear, but it was futile.

"Grandfather, won't you stop him? Once the Star Moon Divine Spear is activated, this small world will be lost!" Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang called out to Fu Cangshan.

"Impossible to stop. Fu Tu is at the peak of the era, and the Star Moon Divine Spear was personally forged by the Royal Lord. Unless the Royal Lord himself intervenes, no one can stop a royal weapon activated by the Royal Lord's heir!" Fu Cangshan's face was also grim. The thought of Luotian being slain and the wrath of Gu Tianshi and Dongbo Xin falling upon the Star Moon Divine Clan was terrifying.

"嗡……" Luotian waved his hand, and a black yin fish appeared above his head. After the previous time it had shielded Luotian from a royal weapon, the yin fish's spirit had been repairing itself. It was only recently completed its restoration and now reappeared under Luotian's invocation.

"Damn it, another royal weapon!" As the yin fish appeared, its spirit's raspy voice echoed through the starry void.

Chapter 1526: I Will

"Luotian, Luotian, do you have to go this far? When I tested you, it was just a little hardship. Do you really have to retaliate like this? I've only just recovered, and now you make me contend with a royal weapon. I refuse to do it!" The yin fish's spirit, filled with resentment, roared at Luotian.

"I didn't mean to. There's no other choice, Old Fish Master! Please help me!" Luotian addressed the yin fish's spirit, his voice carrying a touch of helplessness.

"Damn it, still an era peak royal heir's activation. I'll end you eventually!" Though the yin fish spirit cursed, black qi erupted from its dark form, enveloping Luotian.

"Dao Map, don't just watch. Come out!" The yin fish spirit barked at Fu Xingyue's direction.

"Right, I also have a Divine and Demon Dao Map!" Fu Xingyue slapped his head and waved his hand. The divine and demon dao map, surrounded by black and white qi, roared forth and instantly appeared above Luotian's head.

"Without the yang fish, it'll have to do!" The yin fish displayed a look of disdain and transformed into a black carp, instantly embedding itself in the vacant spot on the divine and demon dao map.

"Remember, you owe me a favor!" A deep voice echoed within the divine and demon dao map—this was the spirit of the divine and demon dao map.

"Owe what? This kid owes it, not me!" The yin fish spirit's voice echoed within the divine and demon dao map.

A sky filled with black qi enveloped the entire starry void, as if plunging into endless darkness.

"Crash..." The Star Moon Divine Spear radiated intense brilliance, piercing through the boundless darkness. It surged forward with overwhelming might toward Luotian.

Despite being at the peak of the era, Luotian felt a strong sense of crisis under the fully unleashed Star Moon Divine Spear. He was certain that even with his extraordinary physical body, it could not withstand a single breath.

Not only Luotian but even Fu Cangshan and Furenbin, two pseudo-kings, felt immense pressure. They continuously moved their hands, forming powerful barriers to encircle Fu Xingyue and others.

"Yin-Yang Unification, Invincible in the World. Yin-Yang Immortal, Boundless Power!" Luotian roared and shattered one of his reincarnated immortal bodies, transforming it into a terrifying wave that pointed toward the divine and demon dao map.

Floods of era power transformed into a white ribbon, instantly rushing into the divine and demon dao map, emitting an equally supreme aura.

"Die!" Fu Tu's face twisted with ferocity. His pale complexion resembled a demon from hell, showing how difficult it was for Fu Tu to activate the Star Moon Divine Spear in his current state.

The resplendent Star Moon Divine Spear, under Fu Tu's full power, seemed to pluck all the stars in the cosmos and embed them within its form. It radiated boundless light and divine laws, rushing toward Luotian.

"End it!" Luotian roared. His black hair flew wildly as he recited the "incantation" taught by the yin fish spirit.

"Crash..." The divine and demon dao map exploded in size, surging forward with overwhelming might to collide head-on with the Star Moon Divine Spear.

"Crack..." The thunderous sound was overwhelming, instantly rushing into Luotian's ears and making his face pale immediately.

Apocalyptic waves erupted from the collision between the Star Moon Divine Spear and the divine and demon dao map, spreading outward. The waves swept across the void, causing it to collapse. The small world trembled under their collision, with vast stretches of space exploding into cracks as if they could be shattered at any moment.

"Boom... Boom..." The hundred barriers set up by Fu Cangshan and Furenbin shattered layer by layer. They had shattered dozens of layers, leaving those within the barriers pale-faced.

"Activating all royal weapons truly equals a king's strike. It's indeed true!" Fu Xingyue's face trembled as he spoke softly.

" How are they doing?" A moment later, Furenbin's face turned grim. That terrifying wave had even made him doubt his ability to withstand it, let alone Luotian and Fu Tu. If one of them fell, it would be a massive loss for the Star Moon Divine Clan.

Two clouds of blood mist floated in the starry void, gradually coalescing. Luotian and Fu Tu appeared before everyone's eyes, their faces as pale as paper, with their cultivation levels plummeting to the late era.

"Damn it!" Luotian muttered under his breath, gazing at Fu Tu with a cold expression.

"Luotian, I can't go on! Now it's up to you!" The yin fish spirit's voice echoed in Luotian's mind. After the collision, it had completely detached from the divine and demon dao map and rushed into Luotian's storage ring.

The divine and demon dao map also slowly shrank, returning to Fu Xingyue's side where she collected it.

"I'll see what else you have to withstand the next strike!" Fu Tu's face twisted with ferocity. Though his cultivation had dropped, seeing that the divine and demon dao map could not be activated again filled Fu Tu with endless satisfaction.

"Fu Tu, enough! If you continue, this small world will be shattered by the Star Moon Divine Spear!" Furenbin called out to Fu Tu, beginning to persuade him.

"Fu Tu, let's end this. If you continue fighting, one of the two will surely fall. It won't benefit the Star Moon Divine Clan!" Fu Cangshan sighed deeply.

"Daydreaming!" Before their words had finished, Fu Tu coldly refused. The Star Moon Divine Spear, which had flown somewhere, instantly returned to Fu Tu's head, radiating waves of divine brilliance.

"Fu Tu, don't push it too far!" Fu Xingxuan, Fu Xingyue, and Fu Xingyang shouted at Fu Tu.

"What can you do if it's too much?" Fu Tu roared, his hands moving again. He spat out a mouthful of blood, infusing it into the Star Moon Divine Spear.

The humming echoed again. A tall figure in imperial robes appeared before their eyes, radiating an overwhelming aura—this was the image of a former royal lord of the Star Moon Divine Clan.

"Summoning the royal's spirit!" Everyone was shocked. They hadn't expected Fu Tu to achieve this.

The Star Moon Divine Spear also exploded in size, cutting through the starry void and landing in the spirit's hand. The spirit radiated supreme authority, looking down upon all, even Fu Cangshan and Furenbin's faces showed solemnity.

"Kill!" Fu Tu growled, his withered fingers pointing toward where Luotian stood.

At the same time, the Star Moon Divine Clan's royal spirit slowly raised its arms. The Star Moon Divine Spear radiated waves of brilliant light, rushing toward Luotian with a mighty strike.

" My condition is better than yours!" Luotian was thoroughly enraged by Fu Tu, his eyes filled with fierce killing intent. He moved his hands, shattering the remaining reincarnated immortal bodies within him.

"Crash..." White light instantly spread beneath the starry void filled with cracks, gathering together.

"Luotian, what else do you have to withstand a royal weapon!" Everyone was shocked, their eyes filled with disbelief as they gazed at Luotian.

Luotian's hands continuously manipulated, transforming the pure era power into thousands of divine characters. These characters resembled white dragons, flying through the starry void.

"Crash..." Golden palaces instantly formed before their astonished gazes, radiating supreme power and appearing in front of them.

"Dear husband, let me!" As Luotian was about to use his final means, a clear and cold voice echoed through the starry void. At the same time, Sun Mengru's figure appeared before everyone's eyes like a celestial goddess.

"Who dares harm my dear husband, I'll make you die!" Sun Mengru's eyes flashed with waves of divine light. Her entire body radiated golden brilliance, and an invisible wave spread from her, while a gray small tower appeared in her hands.

"Subdue!" Sun Mengru didn't hesitate upon appearing. The gray small tower flew from her hands and suddenly expanded, transforming into a towering structure with overwhelming might—the era treasure, the Qiankun Zhenhun Tower.

"Another human!" Seeing Sun Mengru, their faces changed again. They hadn't expected Luotian to have another human among his allies, and this one clearly wasn't simple—possessing an era treasure.

"Boom..." As they were shocked, the gray Qiankun Zhenhun Tower collided with the Star Moon Divine Spear. The thunderous sound of collision echoed again in the starry void.

Apocalyptic waves swept through the starry void. The already damaged small world could no longer withstand it, and with their collision, it shattered violently.

At the same time, outside the Star Moon Divine Clan's palace where Luotian and others had entered, it crashed apart. The wild waves spread outward from the palace, destroying luxurious buildings one after another.

"What's happening!" All members of the Star Moon Divine Clan were shocked. Their figures instantly flew up, heading toward the palace.

Vast waves of gray energy surged forth, obscuring their vision and leaving the Star Moon Divine Clan members with puzzled expressions.

"What's happening? Isn't this our clan's old ancestor and the era peak attendants' secluded cultivation place? It was said to be a small world. How did it become like this? Did the small world collapse?" They stood in the sky, discussing among themselves, gazing at the swirling chaos.

"How could it be? This is a small world. Even if a pseudo-king wanted to collapse it, it would be difficult. Moreover, this small world is the secluded cultivation place of our Star Moon Divine Clan's pseudo-kings. Who dares to do this!" Their eyes showed confusion, then they saw the gray chaos gradually calming down. A beam of brilliant light flew out from within the chaotic waves.

Chapter 1527: Farewell to the Divine Emperor

"Buzz..." The buzzing sound echoed within the gradually calming chaotic void. The Star Moon Divine Spear spun rapidly, flying out from the gray chaotic waves.

"It's the Star Moon Divine Spear!" A moment later, the members of the Star Moon Divine Clan instantly recognized it.

As the Star Moon Divine Spear flew out, a black tower also roared forth, subduing heaven and earth. Even the terrifying chaotic waves calmed down.

"What's going on? Did someone break into the small world and attack our Star Moon Divine Clan?" The members of the Star Moon Divine Clan looked at the Qiankun Zhenhun Tower, which radiated an aura no less than that of the Star Moon Divine Spear. They felt some unease.

While the members of the Star Moon Divine Clan were discussing, the Qiankun Zhenhun Tower completely subdued the chaotic waves. The gray qi was absorbed into the tower, and the figures of Fu Cangshan and Furenbin appeared before everyone's eyes.

"Respect the Divine Emperor, respect the attendants, and revere the elders!" The members of the Star Moon Divine Clan bowed respectfully upon seeing Fu Cangshan and others.

"Nothing serious, everyone disperse!" Furenbin spoke softly to the members of the Star Moon Divine Clan. He then gazed at the position of the deep abyss with an aged look.

"Buzz..." Golden light flickered. Luotian and Sun Mengru appeared like a pair of celestial beings from the gray abyss, but their faces were pale. Luotian was even covered in blood.

"Who is that person? I find her so unfamiliar!" The members of the Star Moon Divine Clan looked at Sun Mengru, discussing among themselves.

"It's a human!" However, the members of the Star Moon Divine Clan soon erupted in anger. They looked at Sun Mengru's stunning beauty, their expressions filled with disbelief.

"How could a human appear within our Star Moon Divine Clan? Kill her!" A moment later, waves of killing intent spread from every member of the Star Moon Divine Clan.

"Everyone stay calm. We'll handle this ourselves!" Furenbin felt a jolt in his heart upon seeing Sun Mengru.

"Buzz..." A ball of blood qi slowly coalesced, and Fu Tu's figure reappeared before their eyes. The members of the Star Moon Divine Clan showed expressions of shock.

"What's going on? Why is the Royal Lord's heir so pitiful, reborn in blood!" They spoke in disbelief upon seeing Fu Tu, who had been reborn twice and was now pale-faced.

Fu Tu had awakened eight years ago. Naturally, the members of the Star Moon Divine Clan recognized him. Moreover, the status of the Royal Lord's heir within the Star Moon Divine Clan was so prestigious. When had he ever been so pitiful?

"Buzz..." Luotian pushed off the ground, his body flashing forward to stand before Fu Tu. He grabbed Fu Tu's neck.

After being reborn twice, Fu Tu was in the worst condition. Even a sage at its peak could subdue him. After all, the cost of two rebirths was too great.

"Is that the new commander of the Star Moon Guard?" They then saw Luotian attacking Fu Tu, their expressions filled with confusion.

"Disperse!" Furenbin's face changed. He and Fu Cangshan both waved their hands, forming a barrier that enveloped them, completely isolating their view from the outside.

"Don't think you're worthy of killing me!"

"You die first!" Luotian had been thoroughly enraged by Fu Tu. Originally, he was fine, but now Sun Mengru's identity had been exposed. For them, it was definitely not a good thing.

"Luotian, don't be reckless!" Fu Cangshan and Furenbin's faces suddenly changed because they felt the killing intent in Luotian this time.

"Boom..." But before their words had finished, Fu Tu's body turned into a cloud of blood mist in Luotian's hands.

"Buzz..." A weak soul emerged from the blood mist, as if a breeze could carry it away. It was captured again by Luotian.

"Luotian... listen to me, if you kill him, you won't be able to leave this冥域!" Furenbin's eyes were filled with tension as he shouted at Luotian.

"I've never suffered such a loss. Do you think the Royal Lord's heir is invincible? I've killed before, and I'm still alive!" Luotian's face was cold as he tightened his grip again. In front of him, the soul was just an ant.

"Buzz..." However, as Luotian wanted to kill Fu Tu, the Star Moon Divine Spear emitted waves of brilliant light. It instantly struck Luotian's hand, causing him pain and making him slightly loosen his grip. A supreme light also acted upon Fu Tu's weak soul.

"Alas..." A long sigh echoed from the Star Moon Divine Spear. The radiant light enveloped Fu Tu's soul, making it vanish in Luotian's hand and be absorbed into the Star Moon Divine Spear.

"Respected Master of the Weapon!" Luotian then saw the spirit of the Star Moon Divine Spear fly out from within it. He showed a respectful expression, bowing to it. After all, in the冥域, the Star Moon Divine Spear had helped them before.

"I'm sorry. I can't let my master's only bloodline die at your hands!" The spirit of the Star Moon Divine Spear spoke softly.

"Ah!" Luotian's face was pale. He nodded, although he really wanted to kill Fu Tu. But Luotian also knew that unless he could break through the Star Moon Divine Spear's defense and with Fu Cangshan and Furenbin present, he couldn't let himself kill Fu Tu.

"Luotian, it's indeed Fu Tu who was wrong. Neither of you killed each other. Let this be even. Please give me a small favor and let Fu Tu go! If there's another time, you two will have your fate. I won't interfere!" Fu Cangshan spoke to Luotian.

Hearing Fu Cangshan's words, Luotian clenched his fists and sighed deeply. Finally, he nodded: "Let this be settled. If there's another time, I won't hold back!"

"Good!" Hearing Luotian's words, Fu Cangshan nodded. Fu Tu had been severely injured and would need years to recover. For now, they couldn't confront each other.

"There's nothing else. I'll take my leave!" Luotian sighed deeply, then took out a pill and swallowed it. He then flashed his body toward the outside of the Star Moon Divine Clan.

"Out!" As Luotian flew out, the people watching the barrier instantly reacted. They blocked Luotian's path, his pale face.

"Commander of the Star Moon Guard, who defeated a human genius! Now returning to his quarters for recovery. After healing, he will be rewarded!" Fu Xingxuan's voice echoed in the sky, making the members of the Star Moon Divine Clan shocked. They made way for Luotian's path, their expressions filled with respect.

"Indeed, the commander of the Star Moon Guard! He was able to defeat a human genius!" People discussed among themselves, watching Luotian leave with a pale face.

"This girl!" Luotian smiled lightly. Although Fu Xingxuan's lie was obvious, it was still effective now.

Luotian flashed his body toward his quarters. Upon arriving, he changed his appearance and flew out of the domain.

Fu Xingxuan watched Luotian leave, his expression complex. He sighed deeply and then bit his lip. His voice echoed again in the world: "I have one more thing to announce!"

"That is, from today on, I Fu Xingxuan will resign as the Star Moon Divine Emperor and hand over this position to my brother, Fu Xingyang!" Fu Xingxuan's cold voice echoed in the world, making everyone's eyes filled with disbelief as they looked at Fu Xingxuan.

"Xingxuan, what do you mean?" Hearing Fu Xingxuan's words, Fu Xingyang's face showed disbelief. He hadn't expected Fu Xingxuan to say such news.

"Divine Emperor, you're doing so well. Why would you resign from the Divine Emperor?" The people of the Star Moon Divine Clan, who had high popularity with Fu Xingxuan, immediately refuted loudly.

"I've made up my mind!" Fu Xingxuan's voice was resolute. He looked at Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang.

"Second brother, I know you never wanted to be a Divine Emperor. So this position is better given to my older brother. You won't mind, will you?" Fu Xingxuan smiled.

"And I did this because I have my own matters. Please allow me one last act of defiance!" Fu Xingxuan smiled.

"Stupid girl!" Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang's faces showed bitterness. They had guessed Fu Xingxuan's thoughts, their eyes filled with pity.

At that moment, Luotian was pale-faced and in terrible condition. He didn't know that after he left, Fu Xingxuan had decided to relinquish the Star Moon Divine Emperor position.

"Good thing I have the Thousand Transformation Mask. Otherwise, leaving the冥域 would be a problem!" Luotian muttered to himself and flew toward the entrance of the冥域.

Chapter 1528: Let's Go Together

Under the gray starry void, Luotian was pale-faced. Although he had pills to recover, his battle with Fu Tu had injured him too severely. His blood-rebirth had damaged his foundation, and his dantian's reincarnated immortal body was completely shattered. Although he had recovered two of them, his strength had dropped to the worst in history, even worse than late era.

But fortunately, Luotian had the Thousand Transformation Mask to conceal his cultivation and mask his aura. Otherwise, if he revealed himself as a human, he would be hunted endlessly. With his current state, there was no chance of survival.

Luotian flew swiftly. Occasionally, he passed by members of the ancient clans. After careful probing, they didn't dare to question him too much. After all, his aura was that of the Star Moon Divine Clan, and his cultivation level was late era.

Although the ancient clans had grown significantly, late era still remained top-tier strength. Not everyone dared to provoke it.

Luotian smiled slightly and quickly reached the entrance of the冥域. Once he entered human territory, he would be completely safe.

"Just a hundred miles!" Luotian sighed softly. He hadn't expected the journey to be so smooth, but his heart wasn't at ease. He knew that what was coming next would be the final test.

A hundred miles wasn't much for Luotian. Even with his severe injuries, he reached the entrance in a moment.

As the distance closed, two figures radiating golden light appeared before Luotian's eyes. He sighed slightly.

"Stop!" Before Luotian had stopped, the two guarding the entrance of the冥域 spoke softly. Their eyes looked at Luotian.

"Unluckily!" Luotian stopped, smiling bitterly. He looked at the two figures radiating intense aura, a hot wave of energy around them.

The ancient clans had agreed to take turns guarding the entrance of the冥域. There were guards outside and inside, and these two were from the Golden Crow Clan—Jinzi Ming and Jinzitao, second and third sons of the nine princes of the Golden Crow Clan.

"Your progress is truly astonishing!" Luotian thought to himself, marveling at the Golden Crow Clan's strength. Both of them were now at late era level. Though they weren't as strong as Fu Xingyue and others, they were still formidable forces.

"Are you from the Star Moon Divine Clan?" Jinziming looked at Luotian with suspicion. He could clearly see that Luotian had been severely injured.

"Yes, I am the new commander of the Star Moon Guard. My name is Gu Sansi!" Luotian bowed to them.

"Why are you here? This is the entrance to the Nine Realms. Are you trying to enter the Nine Realms?" Jinziming asked Luotian, his eyes cautious. He didn't think Luotian had wandered here by accident.

"I'm not lying. I have a hidden injury, and without an opportunity, I can't survive for a hundred years. So I want to take the risk and enter other realms, hoping for an opportunity! Please allow me this favor!" Luotian smiled at them.

"Go back. Without the permission of a pseudo-king, no one is allowed to enter or exit here. If you go out and accidentally clash with humans, causing a war between the two sides, you won't be able to bear that responsibility. Neither will we!" Jinzitao shook his head. Hearing Luotian was the new commander of the Star Moon Guard, he felt a grudge.

Back then in the Star Moon Divine Clan, Luotian had become the commander of the Star Moon Guard as Fu Mengchen. He had stepped on all nine brothers, making them remember it as a disgrace. Now another Star Moon Guard commander had appeared, and they found it hard to accept.

" I almost forgot about that!" Seeing their expressions of grudge, Luotian sighed bitterly. He bowed again.

"Two princes, I truly have no choice! Please allow me this favor. When I return to the clan, I will definitely repay you. This is a dangerous place in the冥域. I have obtained two sacred herbs, please accept them as gifts!" Luotian was now at the mercy of others. If he were still at the peak of the era, he could have killed his way out.

But now his cultivation had dropped and he was severely injured. He wasn't sure if he could break through their ambush.

Moreover, his current identity was the commander of the Star Moon Divine Clan. If he used force, it would harm the relationship with the Golden Crow Clan.

"Impossible. Go back! We two clans have good relations, but we can't let you in!" Jinziming firmly replied, indicating he wouldn't allow Luotian to enter.

"Alas..." Luotian sighed deeply. He clenched his fists, realizing there was no other way but to force his way out.

"Are you going to fight us?" Seeing Luotian's rising aura, Jinziming and Jinzitao's faces turned cold.

"Excuse me!" Luotian spoke softly, then transformed his sickly body into a streak of white light, rushing toward the entrance of the冥域.

"Go back!" Seeing Luotian rush towards them, Jinziming and Jinzitao's faces turned cold. They moved their bodies to block Luotian's path.

"Boom..." In an instant, Luotian punched them. His body flew back.

"Cultivation drop is really troublesome!" Luotian returned to his original position, sighing inwardly. Although he hadn't suffered any real damage, it was difficult to break through now.

"Dear husband, let me!" Sun Mengru's voice echoed in Luotian's mind. But he shook his head.

With Sun Mengru's strength, defeating the two was no problem. However, Sun Mengru was a human. If she appeared openly, it would cause many problems.

"Two late era masters, yet they can't stop me!" Luotian transmitted to Sun Mengru. At the same time, he moved his body again and rushed toward Jinziming and Jinzitao.

"Seems like you want to die. Then we won't give the Star Moon Divine Clan any face!" Jinziming and Jinzitao saw Luotian rushing toward them again. Their faces finally showed some irritation. They moved their hands, and golden flames instantly filled the entire starry void, transforming into flocks of fire crows that rushed toward Luotian.

Each flock of golden fire crows emitted a terrifying aura. If Luotian were hit by them in his current state, it wouldn't be good either. After all, he was at less than a third of his peak strength.

"Ha..." But as these terrifying flocks of fire crows were about to touch Luotian, a clear and cold voice echoed through the starry void. A powerful pressure instantly made Luotian, Jinziming and Jinzitao stop.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." The flocks of fire crows exploded in a thunderous sound, turning into sparks that scattered across the starry void.

Stars shimmered. A purple figure flew toward Luotian, her slender form and stunning beauty approaching the stars.

"Star Moon Princess... Divine Emperor?" Jinziming and Jinzitao saw the person, instinctively gasped. Then they realized her identity and quickly corrected themselves.

"Two older brothers, it's been a while!" Fu Xingxuan smiled but her voice carried strength and coldness.

"Ah..." Jinziming and Jinzitao's faces showed embarrassment. They could feel the coldness in Fu Xingxuan's voice.

"What..." Luotian showed a hint of confusion. He also couldn't figure out why Fu Xingxuan had appeared here.

"Two older brothers, this is a letter from the Star Moon Divine Clan's pseudo-king. Please let us through!" Fu Xingxuan smiled and waved her hand, sending a jade slip to Jinziming and Jinzitao.

Hearing Fu Xingxuan's words, Jinziming and Jinzitao didn't dare to delay. They quickly took the jade slip. Fu Xingxuan was different from Luotian; she was the Divine Emperor of the Star Moon Divine Clan, representing it.

Jinziming and Jinzitao opened the jade slip. Their faces showed confusion, then solemnity.

"Since the pseudo-king of the Star Moon Divine Clan has spoken, we naturally can't disobey. I didn't expect Princess Xingxuan to have such courage, giving up the Divine Emperor position. Please go!" Jinziming and Jinzitao spoke to Fu Xingxuan, then made way.

"Thank you, two older brothers!" Fu Xingxuan smiled with a city-destroying beauty. She winked at Luotian.

"Thank you, Princess!" Luotian felt grateful and bowed to Fu Xingxuan. Then he took a step forward toward the entrance of the冥域.

"Wait, I'll go with you!" As Luotian just took a step, Fu Xingxuan's voice echoed in his ear. This made Luotian pause slightly.

"What?" His face showed great surprise. He turned around, looking at Fu Xingxuan. Even Jinziming and Jinzitao hadn't expected Fu Xingxuan to choose to go with Luotian into human territory.

"I said I'll go with you. Are you deaf?" Fu Xingxuan spoke softly, flying to Luotian's side.

"Dear Princess, human territory is different from the冥域 and Origin Realm. Your status is noble. If you enter human territory, it's extremely dangerous..." Luotian quickly tried to persuade her.

"Don't say anything. Your identity doesn't let you make decisions for me! What are you doing? Can't you protect me?" Fu Xingxuan interrupted before Luotian could finish.

"Go, don't hesitate. If you hesitate too long, we won't be able to leave!" Fu Xingxuan's voice echoed in Luotian's mind, making his heart slightly startled.

Chapter 1529: Switching Positions

Fu Xingxuan took a step forward, instantly appearing beside Luotian. Her purple eyes showed urgency, making Luotian's heart startle slightly.

"Go!" Then Luotian spread his vast spiritual awareness, his eyes filled with shock. He moved his body toward the entrance.

"You want to leave?" As Luotian took action, a cold voice echoed through the starry void. Three powerful auras flew from three directions beneath the stars, their overwhelming pressure descending upon Luotian. He stopped his body and showed a slight smile.

"Fast!" Fu Xingxuan sighed softly, standing before Luotian. She looked at the three figures approaching them.

"They're them!" Luotian saw the three and felt a jolt. He sighed inwardly, knowing trouble was coming.

Golden flames carried a scorching aura through the starry void. Jin Yangxi, the royal heir of the Golden Crow Clan, stood before Fu Xingxuan and Luotian. His face wore a smile.

On the other side, Hun Tian Clan's royal heir Hun Batian and Yu Clan's royal heir Yu Fantian also approached from the other two directions. They joined Jin Yangxi, surrounding the entire starry void.

"Three royal heirs, why are you blocking our path?" Fu Xingxuan's face was solemn as she looked at them. She knew they had ill intentions but pretended not to know.

"Fu Xingxuan, don't play dumb. We all know who this person is. You Star Moon Divine Clan can't protect him at all!" Jin Yangxi smiled, scanning Luotian.
