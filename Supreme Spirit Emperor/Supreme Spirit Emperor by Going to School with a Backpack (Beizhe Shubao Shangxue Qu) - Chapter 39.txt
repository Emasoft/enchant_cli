At this moment, the skill was no longer a relic; the aura of the Bone-Devouring Peak posed considerable pressure for those at the Body-Refining stage. Even someone as gifted as Shangguan Hongtu could be momentarily stunned, and for Luo Tian, that brief moment was more than enough.

Indeed, the instant Luo Tian's aura burst forth, Shangguan Hongtu’s two spiritual bodies trembled imperceptibly.

Luo Tian's eyes flashed with icy resolve. He leapt aside from the incoming energy mark, his formidable spiritual awareness spreading outward as his hands moved swiftly. Wherever his spiritual awareness reached, a massive energy seal formed from his spirit and was thrust forward with immense force.

“Soul-Stealing Seal!” This was Luo Tian’s strongest martial technique, a formless hurricane that surged forward.

“Aaaah!” A heart-wrenching cry echoed, leaving people with ringing ears.

On the arena, Shangguan Hongtu’s two spiritual bodies had already vanished, while he himself lay on the ground, clutching his head and emitting agonized cries.

This all transpired in an instant. Some had yet to comprehend what was happening when they heard several thunderous booms from the arena, and then saw Shangguan Hongtu already lying prostrate.

Luo Tian panted heavily. Shangguan Hongtu was indeed formidable; he had unleashed everything to subdue him. If it were anyone else, they would have perished multiple times already.

“Seize the opportunity to end his life!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed coldly. He did not know what Shangguan Hongtu still had in store, for he was a prodigy of the Ghost Sect. Up to now, Shangguan Hongtu had not yet revealed any weapon.

With that thought, Luo Tian pushed off the ground with his feet, his frail body soaring into the air. He waved his hand, and a bronze cauldron radiating blue lightning appeared before everyone’s eyes.

The Soul-Subduing Cauldron—Luo Tian could not yet fully wield it, but he could only use its unparalleled gravity to crush opponents.

At the moment the cauldron appeared, Du Yongchang’s face turned pale. He could sense how immense the pressure was from the cauldron; this gravity was beyond what Shangguan Hongtu could endure.

“Don’t!” Du Yongchang’s eyes filled with red as he tried to stop it, but it was too late. Almost instantly, the cauldron descended.

“Hum…” The cauldron’s surface scraped through the air, as if it could pierce the very ground. It crashed down with a mighty force.

The direction of its descent was none other than Shangguan Hongtu, who clutched his head in agony.

Chapter 186: The Ghost Ancestor

Chapter 186: The Ghost Ancestor

The heavy Soul-Subduing Cauldron, brimming with immense pressure, crashed down upon the fallen Shangguan Hongtu.

At this moment, everyone knew that Shangguan Hongtu, the prodigy of the Ghost Sect, was finished.

“Not!” Du Yongchang’s heart ached with regret; he should not have let Shangguan Hongtu face Luo Tian. He had never imagined that Shangguan Hongtu would actually be killed by him.

Wei Mingxuan lowered his head in contemplation, pondering how to withstand the wrath of the Ghost Sect and the Yin-Yang Sect should Shangguan Hongtu die. Meanwhile, the Corpse Sect loomed like a thorn in their side.

The disciples of the Five Elements Sect, however, paid no heed and erupted into enthusiastic applause. They had not expected Luo Tian’s sudden ferocity to be so terrifying.

Some of the Five Elements Sect’s Bone-Devouring stage elders even trembled in their seats, especially those at the early stages of Bone-Devouring. They secretly mused whether they could withstand Luo Tian’s relentless assault.

But soon, most people felt a bitter sorrow; the earlier attacks were manageable, but this bronze cauldron was truly terrifying—it would shatter anything it touched.

The Soul-Subduing Cauldron materialized instantly above Shangguan Hongtu. At the last moment, a jade pendant at his waist seemed to sense the cauldron’s pressure and radiated golden light.

A golden barrier enveloped Shangguan Hongtu, its intricate patterns suggesting it was no ordinary creation.

“Crack…” A cracking sound echoed as the golden barrier, though formidable, was crushed under the cauldron’s immense pressure.

Yet this brief delay caused the cauldron to deviate somewhat.

“Boom…” The entire arena shattered under this overwhelming pressure, and the Soul-Subduing Cauldron stood proudly, as if proclaiming its dominance over heaven and earth.

Though protected by the golden barrier, Shangguan Hongtu was still severely injured by the冲击.

Luo Tian, now on the ground, gazed at the cauldron with exhilaration. He longed for the day he could fully command this Soul-Subduing Cauldron, when it would be absolutely formidable.

He sighed, then turned his gaze back to Shangguan Hongtu. He could sense that the latter was now no better than an ordinary person; a slight exertion would shatter him.

Luo Tian flew forward, lifted Shangguan Hongtu with care, and even hesitated slightly before touching him.

“Luo Tian, you’d better release him; otherwise, you’ll bring great calamity upon the Five Elements Sect!” Du Yongchang barked as he stepped forward. If Luo Tian hadn’t grabbed Shangguan Hongtu first, his fury might have crushed him with a single palm.

But considering the risk of accidentally killing Shangguan Hongtu due to overexertion, Du Yongchang suppressed his anger and spoke.

“Why?” Luo Tian’s face remained impassive, though he was addressing Du Yongchang, a master of the Soul-Refining stage. Still, he asked coldly.

“Because he is the grandson of the Ghost Ancestor of the Ghost Sect!” Du Yongchang’s face bore a solemn expression, fearing Luo Tian might impulsively kill Shangguan Hongtu. If that happened, not only would the Five Elements Sect suffer, but he too would be caught in the fallout.

“Ghost Ancestor? He’s still alive!” Wei Mingxuan and others exchanged shocked glances.

The Ghost Ancestor, a peer of the Five Elements Sect’s founder from ten thousand years ago, was also one of the legendary warriors of that era. He had dominated all others and founded the Ghost Sect in the Southern Region, where sects flourished.

Ten thousand years had passed, yet major sects still recorded the astonishing feats of that generation’s prodigies. The Ghost Ancestor’s name ranked among the top three.

“Indeed, he is still alive. Therefore, he cannot die; if he does, countless will perish with him!” Du Yongchang’s gaze swept over Wei Mingxuan and the other key figures of the Five Elements Sect, his voice low.

Wei Mingxuan’s face darkened. Du Yongchang’s revelation was staggering. A warrior from ten thousand years ago still alive? The Five Elements Sect’s founder had merely left behind some resources before breaking through to the upper realm, but the Ghost Ancestor had chosen to remain in this world. Why?

But now was not the time for such thoughts. A warrior who had made his name ten thousand years ago—how terrifying must he be? Wei Mingxuan could not even imagine. If such a person came for the Five Elements Sect, they might not withstand it.

“Luo Tian, release him!” Wei Mingxuan’s voice rang out as he gazed at Luo Tian. He knew this would be a hardship for Luo Tian, but he had no choice; he could not let the Five Elements Sect fall into peril. Just as in the past, when faced with a similar dilemma, he had chosen the sect over his beloved.

“Hm?” Including Luo Tian, all Five Elements Sect disciples turned to Wei Mingxuan in disbelief.

The Five Elements Sect’s disciples knew that Wei Mingxuan was the most domineering among them, always issuing commands without question. Yet now, someone had dared to challenge them, and he was being told to release the one who sought to kill Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s brow furrowed slightly. He had long been wary of Shangguan Hongtu; if not for his swift strike, the outcome might have been uncertain.

But upon hearing Wei Mingxuan’s words, he realized the Ghost Ancestor was undeniably a terrifying presence. His mind was in turmoil—killing Shangguan Hongtu would mean having him constantly watch over him, causing sleepless nights. Not killing him meant facing the wrath of this terrifying Ghost Ancestor. Luo Tian’s gaze shifted to his three elder brothers.

Zhang Ziping, Lei Yong, and Ji Chen all saw Luo Tian’s pleading look. Their eyes gleamed with smiles as they nodded to him, and their voices echoed in his mind.

“Do as you wish! At worst, we’ll die!”
Ji Chen’s cold voice rang out.
“Little brother, if you want to kill him, just do it! Afterward, let’s celebrate at Yan Yue Pavilion!” Lei Yong’s encouraging voice trailed off.
“Don’t fear, there are elders here,” Zhang Ziping’s final gentle voice felt like a warm current that eased Luo Tian’s heart.

Luo Tian slightly loosened his grip on Shangguan Hongtu, and a pill appeared in his hand. He placed it into Shangguan Hongtu’s mouth.

“Huff…” After taking the pill, Shangguan Hongtu’s face slightly relaxed and he gradually regained consciousness.

Chapter 187: Die!

Chapter 187: Die!

Seeing Luo Tian revive Shangguan Hongtu, Du Yongchang and Wei Mingxuan both sighed in relief, glad that the situation was turning for the better.

“You must swear blood oaths not to retaliate against Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei. I’ll let you go!” Shangguan Hongtu, still dazed, heard Luo Tian’s cold voice and shivered involuntarily, fully regaining his senses.

Feeling himself held by Luo Tian, Shangguan Hongtu’s face immediately turned furious. Even in the Southern Region, where prodigies abounded, he had never felt so helpless. How much more so in this Northern Region, which he despised?

“You’d better let me go; otherwise, you’ll regret it for a lifetime!” Shangguan Hongtu’s face was twisted with rage, gazing at Luo Tian. Though he was weak, a long-standing aura of superiority rose from him.

“Swear a blood oath that you won’t retaliate against Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei, and I’ll let you go!” Luo Tian repeated.

Blood oaths—martial practitioners use secret methods to invoke their own blood to swear, and if broken, misfortune will follow. From ancient times, even masters of the Soul-Refining stage and above dared not easily swear blood oaths. A single mistake could leave even these great masters unable to withstand the backlash.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Tian Bo, who had just recovered to the Soul-Refining stage, stood among the crowd with a touched expression. Luo Tian had first thought of Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei, not himself or the Five Elements Sect. He feared Shangguan Hongtu would retaliate against them.

“Dream on! I advise you to let me go; otherwise, not only will you suffer, but everyone connected to you will also perish because of your ignorance!” Shangguan Hongtu’s face was arrogant as he barked.

“His end is sealed!” The Five Elements Sect disciples all snorted, knowing that the Dan Pavilion’s people were never afraid of softness. Especially Zhang Ziping and his brothers.

At this moment, Shangguan Hongtu’s death was inevitable; he had repeatedly threatened them. In the Five Elements Sect disciples’ eyes, no matter his status, if he fell into the Dan Pavilion’s hands and dared to threaten them so openly, he would most likely not survive.

Wei Mingxuan was also solemnly watching Luo Tian; he had already ordered him to release Shangguan Hongtu, but Luo Tian remained indifferent. This indicated that Luo Tian still harbored a desire to kill Shangguan Hongtu.

“Luo Tian, let him go! If he dies, the Five Elements Sect truly can’t protect you!” Wei Mingxuan spoke softly, his gaze burning into Luo Tian.

Upon hearing Wei Mingxuan’s words, Zhang Ziping’s face bore an endless disappointment: “You truly are a good sect leader!”

“I…” Wei Mingxuan, seeing Zhang Ziping’s intense disappointment, wanted to say something but ultimately sighed.

Luo Tian’s face was dark with resentment, yet he knew he could die but would not involve his elder brothers. If it were because of himself that Zhang Ziping and the others died, how could he bear it? He had already owed them enough.

As Shangguan Hongtu’s arrogant taunts echoed, Luo Tian slowly loosened his grip on Shangguan Hongtu’s robe and placed him on the ground.

Seeing Luo Tian place Shangguan Hongtu on the ground, the Five Elements Sect disciples fell silent, their faces filled with disbelief. They had never expected the Dan Pavilion to yield today.

But soon, their gazes toward Luo Tian grew more respectful. They knew that Luo Tian had chosen to endure the trouble for the Five Elements Sect, thus refraining from striking.

Seeing Shangguan Hongtu’s arrogant figure, the Five Elements Sect disciples felt an urge to stomp on him. However, since Luo Tian had released him, what right did they have to act? For a moment, the disciples stood red-faced, their eyes almost burning with fire.

As the number one sect in the Northern Region, they were always treated respectfully. Yet today, they had to endure a disciple of their own sect, who had been severely injured by them, shouting and daring not to respond. It was because of his powerful ancestor.

Du Yongchang felt relieved, knowing that Luo Tian had likely weighed the pros and cons. He sighed in relief while observing the expressions of all Five Elements Sect members, as they were a major sect. Seeing them humbled was rare.

Seeing the Five Elements Sect subdued by his aura, Shangguan Hongtu wore a contemptuous smile: “Rest assured; even if you don’t say it, I’ll take care of Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei. After all, one is my fiancée, the other my future brother-in-law! Ha!”

“Die!” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed like a bottomless abyss.

Just as Shangguan Hongtu rose, he shattered into a mist of blood and perished.

At the moment Shangguan Hongtu died, the Five Elements Sect fell into a brief silence, even audible tense breaths.

“Luo, Luo Tian! You killed Shangguan Hongtu!” Du Yongchang, a Soul-Refining stage master, pointed at Luo Tian with his finger, speechless for a moment.

Wei Mingxuan’s face was also shocked; he didn’t know why Luo Tian had suddenly killed him. Perhaps it was related to Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei. At this moment, the priority wasn’t pondering but figuring out how to resolve the situation.

Zhang Ziping and his brothers gazed coldly at Du Yongchang, standing before Luo Tian. Lu Kunpeng also followed behind them. Among the Dan Pavilion disciples, many stood behind them, unsure of what awaited them next.

“Luo Tian is Luo Tian! I submit!” Someone from another peak shouted, joining the Dan Pavilion disciples.

“Luo Dan Shi, you are our role model! This is how a true cultivator should be!” The crowd roared, and more热血 disciples joined the Dan Pavilion’s ranks.

“Done for!” Du Yongchang felt his position as the Yin-Yang Sect master might be lost, even risking his life.

“Luo Tian, you’ve caused a great disaster!” Du Yongchang roared, his face filled with intense killing intent.

At the same time, thousands of miles away in the Southern Region’s Ghost Sect, an old man clad in gray sat cross-legged in a black hall, motionless like a statue. No breath, no heartbeat—his aura exuded an ancient sense of沧桑.

Suddenly, he opened his eyes, emitting a cold glint. His hand lightly waved toward the sky as if swatting a fly.

Chapter 189: Hope

The Five Elements Sect disciples gazed in awe at the two terrifying attacks colliding in the sky. Under their force, they felt like ants, and those attacks seemed like divine wrath, far stronger than any they had seen before when Lu Kunpeng had blocked the Dan Lightning.

“Are you Du Yongchang? The current master of the Yin-Yang Sect?” A senior in the sky asked, his face calm as he gazed at Du Yongchang, who lowered his head.

“Indeed, I am a disciple!” Du Yongchang bowed respectfully. Facing someone of the same rank as his sect’s ancestor, he dared not be arrogant and answered with a bow.

“We don’t care about your relationship with the Ghost Sect; don’t overstep! Today’s matter ends here!” The elder spoke softly, as if scolding a junior. Yet Du Yongchang felt immense pressure.

As a Soul-Refining stage master and the Yin-Yang Sect’s leader, Du Yongchang had reached heights few could grasp. Yet now, his back was drenched in cold sweat.

“Alright, don’t be nervous; we do give your sect some respect. However, you juniors can fight as you wish—just don’t disturb our old ones’ peace!” The elder spoke again.

“Yes, I shall take my leave! From today on, the feud between the Yin-Yang Sect and Five Elements Sect is settled!” Du Yongchang bowed again.

“Alright, go; convey my greetings to your sect’s elders!” The elder waved his hand and dismissed them.

Du Yongchang, with a respectful expression, led a group of strong individuals down the Five Elements Sect’s mountain. He did not fly, showing respect for these Five Elements Sect elders.

“Wait!” Another elder spoke out.

Du Yongchang’s body trembled slightly, halting his steps and gazing upward.

The Five Elements Sect disciples also dared not speak, watching as one of the elders stepped forward from among them.

Mu Nianqing wore a respectful expression, for this elder was the ancestor of the Greenwood Peak.

The Greenwood Peak’s ancestor extended his hand, emitting a powerful suction force from it. His target was Luo Tian’s surroundings.

In Luo Tian’s astonished gaze, the blood that had turned into mist moments ago began to rise from the ground, gathering together.

Intense wood-element energy enveloped each drop of blood until it formed a head-sized mass. The Greenwood Peak’s ancestor then produced a crystalline bottle from his hand.

As the bottle appeared, everyone’s eyes lit up; they could sense its powerful wood-element energy. It was clearly no ordinary item.

The Greenwood Peak’s ancestor turned his hand slightly, and the blood flowed into the bottle like an arrow.

The Greenwood Peak’s ancestor’s fingers moved rapidly, emitting countless seals from his fingertips. The surrounding wood-element energy seemed to be under his control, even causing some disciples with wood-element constitutions to feel their own energy uncontrollable.

After a short while, the Greenwood Peak’s ancestor let out a shout: “Seal!”

A powerful sealing force emanated from his hand, landing on the bottle.

Ignoring everyone’s stunned expressions, the Greenwood Peak’s ancestor continued: “Deliver this to the Ghost Sect. I can only help so much; whether he lives or not depends on his own fate!”

Though the elder’s words were calm, they caused a storm among the listeners.

“Elder, do you mean Shangguan Hongtu can still be revived?” Du Yongchang’s face changed drastically, suppressing his excitement and asking hesitantly.

“There is a fifty percent chance. If what you said about the Ghost Ancestor still being alive is true, it should be fine. After all, I can’t do anything!” The Greenwood Peak’s ancestor spoke softly.

“Boom…” Everyone was stunned by the elder’s words.

What condition was Shangguan Hongtu in? They had all witnessed it; to them, he was already beyond death. Yet now, there was a possibility of revival! This exceeded their comprehension.

Luo Tian’s heart also surged with waves upon hearing this. He hadn’t expected Shangguan Hongtu could still live, but his thoughts weren’t on that. He thought of another person—Chen Yunting!

Indeed, Luo Tian truly felt that among the people he regretted most, Chen Yunting was first. Now, with the Greenwood Peak elder saying that a deceased person could still live, how could he not be excited?

“Thank you, elder!” Du Yongchang’s face was filled with gratitude. He carefully took the bottle and bowed respectfully, leading the Yin-Yang Sect’s strong individuals down from Five Elements Mountain.

“Wei Mingxuan! You did well this time! No longer hesitant like before; this is what a sect leader should be!” The Greenwood Peak’s ancestor retreated, and the elder who had spoken before spoke again.

Wei Mingxuan wore a respectful expression; the one speaking was none other than his master, the previous Five Elements Sect leader.

“Since the Five Elements Sect has thrived until now, it’s not through submission! It’s through strength. Without strength, people will look down on you. Also, it’s through disciples; without them, what is a sect?”

“Strength is the root. You, the peak leaders, are the branches; disciples are the leaves. All three must be present!” The elder didn’t let Wei Mingxuan speak and continued, his gaze burning at the Five Elements Sect disciples.

“Do you understand?” The elder’s words seemed to be for Wei Mingxuan, but also for every disciple.

“Disciple understands!” Wei Mingxuan was intelligent enough to grasp the elder’s meaning and bowed respectfully.

“Understood, then. Disperse! Remember, unless it’s a matter of the sect’s survival, we won’t appear. This is also a test for you!” The elder spoke again and showed signs of departure.

“Disciple Luo Tian, I have something to ask the Greenwood Peak’s ancestor!”
Luo Tian knelt among the crowd, appearing unremarkable but his voice was resoundingly clear.

“Ah?” The elders looked at this troublemaker who had caused the Five Elements Sect no peace, their faces showing interest.

“Good! Considering your performance, we old ones are satisfied. Speak up! If it’s something within my power, I’ll help!” The Greenwood Peak’s ancestor smiled lightly, clearly fond of Luo Tian.

“Disciple wishes to ask: how can the dead be revived?” Luo Tian’s body trembled slightly, his voice quivering with eagerness as he gazed at the Greenwood Peak’s ancestor.

Chapter 190: One Sword Shatters the Ghost Sect

Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the elders’ bodies trembled slightly. Their faces bore confusion as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“Did you have a very important person who died?” The Greenwood Peak’s ancestor asked.

“Yes, very important!” Luo Tian nodded solemnly.

“Since ancient times, the cycle of heaven and earth has never allowed anyone to return from death. Unless one reaches the pinnacle of cultivation, they can only use a fragment of their soul to reincarnate. There has never been any record of someone returning from death!” The Greenwood Peak’s ancestor shook his head.

“But how did Shangguan Hongtu manage it? You said he might still be revived!” Luo Tian asked, his face filled with strong resentment.

“Legends say some ancient masters could use the blood of a recently deceased person to revive them. According to my knowledge, if the Ghost Ancestor is truly still alive, his cultivation must have reached the pinnacle of this world. Thus, he should have a way to revive them!” The Greenwood Peak’s ancestor wore an expression of yearning, clearly in awe of the Ghost Ancestor’s level.

Luo Tian’s face bore disappointment; he knew even with the Greenwood Peak and other elders, they couldn’t revive Chen Yunting who had been dead for so long. He bowed respectfully.

“However, it is said that some masters of unparalleled cultivation can achieve this—finding people in the cycle and reviving them. These are all legends, not entirely可信. Even if someone achieved it, it’s beyond the capacity of this Tianyuan Continent. At least I’ve never seen it!” The Greenwood Peak’s ancestor spoke again.

The Greenwood Peak’s ancestor’s words sparked a glimmer of hope in Luo Tian’s eyes. His gaze was resolute, determined to fight for even the smallest chance.

“Don’t think too much; take each step carefully!” Zhang Ziping patted Luo Tian’s shoulder, encouragingly. His heart also harbored a longing; if one could truly revive the dead, then…

“Alright, go back to your duties!” Wei Mingxuan gazed respectfully at the elders leaving and began organizing.

Upon hearing Wei Mingxuan’s words, all the peak leaders led everyone back to their respective positions. However, they felt a slight longing, hoping to become someone capable of wielding one palm or sword.

……

The Ghost Sect, a renowned sect in the Southern Region, had mountains that were no less remarkable. Unlike other peaks, the Ghost Mountain was dark in color. From a distance, one could clearly sense a cool and solemn atmosphere.

“Break-Soul Stone—this Ghost Sect is truly extravagant, using Break-Soul Stone to forge a mountain. Just this gesture alone is astonishing!” A middle-aged beauty appeared in the sky above the Ghost Mountain, gazing at its dark form with a sigh.

Break-Soul Stone was material used in the cultivation world to forge weapons. Though not rare, it was quite uncommon. Its sole feature was its durability. The value of this mountain alone was immeasurable.

“Who dares to fly above my Ghost Sect? Come down immediately; don’t wait for our sect’s strength to kill you!” Some disciples of the Ghost Sect saw the woman in the sky and did not show fear. Though they were at the Body-Refining stage, they still shouted at her.

“Kill? The Ghost Sect! You are truly arrogant!” The woman, clad in white, wore a mocking expression.

“This is the Ghost Sect! Flying is prohibited within a thousand miles. This is our sect’s rule!” The disciple spoke again, his face filled with endless arrogance, as if he had already seen the woman in the sky being killed by the Ghost Sect’s strength.

The woman said nothing more and instead took a pale-blue long sword from her waist, gazing at the massive Ghost Mountain. Her eyes flashed with coldness.

She swung her sword, and pale-blue water-element energy transformed into a torrential wave, becoming sword qi that flew from the blade. It swept toward the Ghost Mountain.

“Hum…” A wave of sound spread, and a black barrier formed from all sides of the Ghost Mountain.

This was the Ghost Sect’s mountain defense array, personally arranged by the Ghost Ancestor to withstand heavenly-level martial arts.

“Hilarious!” The disciples of the Ghost Sect laughed out loud, believing that although the woman’s sword qi was strong, it would be impossible to break through the Ghost Sect’s mountain defense array.

“Boom…” But immediately after, they all dropped their jaws in shock, their faces filled with fear.

The mountain defense array, which had never been breached before, was shattered by the woman’s seemingly insignificant sword qi.

The sword qi broke through the mountain defense array and continued toward the Ghost Mountain, slicing it in half.

“Today I’ve come to cause trouble; I’m here for my son’s sake! How long will you hide? If you don’t come out, I’ll end your Ghost Sect’s lineage today!” The woman shouted loudly, her voice echoing throughout the entire Ghost Sect.

“Who are you?” The disciples of the Ghost Sect asked, their voices trembling as they clutched their legs in fear. They no longer had the previous casualness.

It was terrifying; seeing a deep abyss-like sword qi before them, all the Ghost Sect disciples trembled. One sword had shattered their mountain defense array and split the massive Ghost Mountain in half. Was this even a person? This was a mountain made of Break-Soul Stone, yet she had split it with one sword.

“The woman’s grandson has died, but your son is still alive. What do you want me to explain?” The old man in the back of the Ghost Sect’s palace opened his eyes again, his voice echoing through the sect.

“You said your grandson died because he was outmatched, but you used your high cultivation to attack a Body-Refining stage youth?” The woman shouted.

“You’re good at overpowering others, so today I’ll also overpower you! Let’s see who in the Ghost Sect can stop me!” The woman stood on the sky, her endless water-element energy swirling around her.

Chapter 191: Chen Changsheng’s Invitation

“Do you want more after breaking my Ghost Sect?”

“Don’t push us too far; we’ll fight to the death!” The woman’s words echoed, and several old voices resounded through the Ghost Sect.

“Ghost Ancestor, today I say this: anyone of your peers may attack my son. If any of you dare to be shameless and harm a single hair on my son, my wife and I will exterminate your entire clan without mercy!” The woman spoke coldly, her voice echoing through the ears of all Ghost Sect disciples.

“Good! If you continue to cause trouble in my Ghost Sect, I’ll risk injury to kill your couple. Take care!” The Ghost Ancestor responded.

Though the Ghost Ancestor’s words were firm, many disciples heard a deep sense of caution in them.

“Who is this woman? Who is her son? He must be very lucky!” A figure in the crowd muttered, and if Luo Tian were here, he would be surprised. This person was Gu Lei.

Beside him stood a woman with an icy aura, standing proudly—Gu Qianxue.

Around them, a vacuum formed within several feet; no one dared to cross the line. The two had a fearsome reputation in the Ghost Sect. Gu Lei’s poison techniques were unparalleled, and Gu Qianxue’s dual-element power was formidable. When they first entered the Ghost Sect, many had come to cause trouble, but none had left alive.

Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei now wore black attire, their faces carrying a fierce aura. They were unrecognizable from before, giving off an air of being untouchable.

The woman in the sky seemed to have noticed Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei, especially when she looked at Gu Qianxue. A smile appeared on her face as she spoke softly: “This girl is good; she’s worthy of my son!”

She waved her hand, and with a slight flick of her finger, three sword qi flew out. They approached Gu Qianxue and continuously shrank into her body.

“Girl, these three sword qi are a gift for you; they’ll save your life three times!” The woman’s face showed kindness.

Though her words were soft, they caused Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei to feel a storm of emotions. Their faces turned grim.

The Ghost Sect disciples envied Gu Qianxue, for this woman had given her three sword qi. Thinking of the woman’s earlier single sword that shattered the Ghost Mountain, some female disciples in the Ghost Sect even showed jealousy.

“Please, elder, retrieve your sword qi! I already have a beloved; I must refuse!” Gu Qianxue bowed respectfully, her face resolute. A weak figure appeared in her heart, and for the first time, she showed a rare gentleness on her cold face.

The Ghost Sect disciples gaped at Gu Qianxue, who was now a person capable of rivaling the Ghost Ancestor. Many had long desired to become his daughter-in-law, but Gu Qianxue now openly refused.

Gu Lei was tense as he watched the woman in the sky. He knew that those with high cultivation often had peculiar temperaments. If this woman truly killed his sister, he believed the Ghost Ancestor would not risk angering her for their sake.

Shangguan Hongtu, the Ghost Sect’s treasure, had died; even the Ghost Ancestor chose to compromise. What about them?

But what people found astonishing was that the woman in the sky showed no anger. Instead, she wore a look of satisfaction and smiled: “Good! Since you’ve decided this way, I won’t force it. But one day, you’ll regret your decision! These three sword qi have already been given; there’s no way to retrieve them!”

“Ghost Ancestor, remember my words!” The woman’s figure vanished into the world, but her voice echoed in people’s ears.

“Take care! Don’t send!” A cold snort responded, and the back of the Ghost Sect returned to peace. Everything seemed as if it had never happened, but the thousand-foot-high broken Ghost Mountain told people this was no dream.

……

The Five Elements Sect, after the temporary reconciliation between the Yin-Yang Sect and itself, fell into a period of peace.

Luo Tian had no days off during these weeks; he worked day and night on alchemy. He owed too many pills! Especially those who had gone to help the Flying Cloud Sect; even with daily alchemy, he spent about two months completing it.

“Huff…” Luo Tian sighed deeply, sealing three pills into a jade bottle with a look of relief.
