“Where is he?!” Han Lihui roared, determined to find the young man who had dared to provoke him.

The stunned onlookers were jolted from their trance by Han Lihui’s thunderous cry, their confusion giving way to frantic searching for the elusive youth—only to find the chair empty.

“Damn it! He’s escaped!” Mao Xingxiu’s face twisted with fury as he sprinted toward the exit, followed by several figures who vanished like shadows through the doorway.

“You dare provoke me in Beichang County? You won’t escape!” Han Lihui’s expression turned icy.

“Father, I’ll bring him down!” Han Xu’s face lit with battlelust as he vanished from sight.

“Wait for me, Han!” Zhao Yuanming chuckled, chasing after him. Soon, over half of the hundred Bone-Devouring Realm masters at the auction rushed toward the exit, shattering the grand entrance with their sheer force.

Luo Tian had already reached the courtyard when he spotted Wu Di waiting anxiously. Without hesitation, he activated his Nascent Soul Bag, shoving Wu Di inside without regard for whether it could contain a person. He had no time to waste—his senses detected approaching footsteps within a hundred paces; leaving Wu Di behind would mean certain death.

In the blink of an eye, Luo Tian vanished, his face tense yet oddly exhilarated—thrilled by the rush of being hunted.

He shook his head, cursing himself for his recklessness. He had underestimated the greed of these people. The Qi family dared to host an auction because one of their elders had nearly reached the Soul-Transcending Realm, making them untouchable. But Luo Tian was merely a Body-Cultivation Ninth Stage—like a lamb fleeing with a mountain of gold, inviting slaughter.

“Don’t push me too far! If I’m desperate, I’ll retreat and cultivate into the Soul-Transcending Realm, then eradicate this Beichang County!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cold determination as he reached the outskirts of Beiming City, fleeing toward its distant borders.

“Fool! You dare challenge me? You’ll regret this!” Mao Xingxiu’s voice boomed like thunder, his body radiating crimson light as he sneered.

“Too hasty,” Luo Tian mused, scanning the three clan leaders with a shiver of dread. Mao Xingxiu was beneath his notice, but their numbers were daunting.

At Body-Cultivation Ninth Stage, Luo Tian’s speed was merely average—equivalent to a Bone-Devouring Realm beginner. Even with two steps of the Heaven-Blocking Step, he would’ve been caught had they not hesitated.

“Kill!” As Luo Tian pondered, several figures of Body-Cultivation Sixth or Seventh Stage emerged, weapons drawn, their eyes burning with intent to kill.

“Thieves?” Luo Tian’s gaze sharpened as he struck, sending the attackers sprawling with bloodied mouths. Before they could react, his form vanished.

“Who is this? We’ve stepped on a iron plate!” The battered figures stared in terror at the spot where Luo Tian had disappeared.

Before they could recover, a suffocating aura descended upon them—only to be met by ten more figures. Their highest rank was Body-Cultivation Seventh Stage, their faces ashen as Han Lihui glided past them.

“Move,” Han Lihui’s voice was cold as he passed, ignoring the cowering men.

“Swoosh… swoosh…” More figures darted past, ignoring the pitiful men on the ground.

“Die!” Mao Xingxiu followed, his curved blade slicing through the trembling figures. Blood sprayed into his mouth, deepening his already sinister aura.

Luo Tian’s face darkened—his pursuers were now only fifty paces behind, their silhouettes visible.

“Only a hundred li to escape Beichang County… I can’t outrun them!” He mentally calculated, pressing the Dragon Emperor’s Reverse Scale against the Nirvana Dragon Seal.

A golden aura flared, revealing Dragon Baby’s form. Luo Tian’s cultivation leapt to Bone-Devouring Realm Mid-Stage, his power radiating ominously. Yet he didn’t turn back to fight; even with Dragon Baby, facing fifty Bone-Devouring Realm masters was futile.

“Brother, where are we?” Dragon Baby blinked upon landing, ignoring Luo Tian’s urgency.

“Brother is being chased! We must run!” Luo Tian’s tone was grave.

Chapter 309: Leaving Beichang County

“Why run? The Dragon Clan has no cowards! I’ll help brother fight them!” Dragon Baby’s face lit with pride, turning to dash in the opposite direction.

“Dragon Baby, return!” Luo Tian bellowed, exasperated. He hadn’t expected the Dragon Clan’s pride to manifest in this child. His body ached, but he couldn’t abandon Dragon Baby.

He turned, his battle spirit ignited. “Regret… the Rupture Spear is still absorbing the Inferno Iron, hindering my combat power!”

But as he turned, a small figure darted past him like golden lightning. She grabbed his finger, leaving trails of afterimages as she vanished. Her voice echoed: “I was scared! Brother, why are there so many people?!”

Luo Tian’s battle spirit faltered as she yanked him mid-air, nearly causing him to choke. He coughed, realizing he was airborne, carried by Dragon Baby’s speed.

“Where’s the Dragon Clan’s pride?!” Luo Tian mentally cursed, wanting to spank her tiny back.

Yet he marveled at her speed—his face stung from the wind, his body nearly torn open if she went faster.

“Unbelievable! This little runt’s legs move so fast!” Luo Tian mused, watching Han Lihui’s group recede by nearly five hundred paces.

“Damn it! This brat suddenly boosted his speed!” Mao Xingxiu realized, his current pace unable to catch Luo Tian’s burst.

“Who the hell is this kid?” Huang Tianrui mused, recalling Master Huang’s words. He longed to see the gun technique Luo Tian had used.

Zhao Hongyi, meanwhile, schemed about how to outmaneuver the other two clans once captured. Others harbored greed, each with their own thoughts.

The hundred-li journey was completed in under half a breath by Dragon Baby’s speed, arriving at an impossibly thick wall. Luo Tian had never seen such a height.

“Stop!” A commanding voice echoed in his mind, freezing him in fear.

“Soul-Transcending Realm!” Luo Tian’s face darkened—this aura was unmistakable.

A middle-aged man materialized overhead, his golden wings fluttering as he surveyed Luo Tian with a frown.

“Beichang County allows entry but not exit. Those who force their way out die.” The man’s voice was cold.

“Respected elder, I accidentally fell into Beichang County during a teleportation mishap. Please let me depart; I’ll be eternally grateful!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully, aware of the elder’s power.

“Hmph.” He waved his hand, releasing Wu Di from the Nascent Soul Bag. Wu Di coughed violently, awestruck by the spatial realm.

“Nascent Soul Bag! You’re from the Yul Ling Sect?” The man’s face contorted in disbelief.

“Yul Ling Sect?” Luo Tian frowned, surprised the bag was theirs. What connection did Leng Qiuchan have with this sect?

“If you’re a disciple of Yul Ling Sect, then you may leave,” the man smiled warmly.

“Kid, can’t you escape?” The man’s words had barely finished when distant thunderous sounds echoed.

Luo Tian’s face tensed; he resealed Wu Di and Dragon Baby into the bag, sprinting toward the wall. With the elder present, he dared not use Heaven-Blocking Step, so his speed lagged.

The pursuers erupted in fury, firing attacks at him. Even Bone-Devouring Realm beginners closed in, their combined might making the man’s face pale.

Luo Tian grimaced, sealing Dragon Baby into the bag to protect him from the onslaught. His back flared with three colors as his bone marrow surged, a crushing sense of danger gripping him.

A cataclysmic aura erupted behind him, merging martial arts into a dragon that soared toward him.

“Ten steps… eight… five…” Luo Tian poured every ounce of strength into his sprint, eyes locked on the gate.

“Boom!” Like a thunderclap in silence, Luo Tian felt as if struck by a dragon. Blood spewed from his mouth, painting the air with mist.

Had he been at Body-Cultivation Ninth Stage, he’d have been obliterated. Now at Bone-Devouring Mid-Stage, he managed to leap through the gate.

Luo Tian collapsed, smirking as he glared at the fifty Bone-Devouring Realm masters. He memorized each face.

Chapter 310: City Guardian

“Master Ding, you said Beichang County allows entry but not exit!” Han Lihui snarled at the middle-aged man.

“Are you questioning me?” The man’s lips curled, his gaze icy as he surveyed the crowd. Their confidence wavered—had they forgotten the Soul-Transcending Realm’s presence?

“Forgive me! This kid has a grudge with me. Please let me handle him; my father will thank you.”

“Kid, stop playing games. Don’t bring up your father to intimidate me. This is Beichang County, and I am its guardian. Think you’ve gained strength in Beiming City? You’re nothing here!” The man’s tone was cold.

Han Lihui and the other clan leaders broke into sweat. Though the man looked middle-aged, they knew his age was ancient—his father had once seen him in this form.

“Enough. Remember my words: this isn’t your three clans’ domain. You may dominate, but don’t forget the guardian exists!” The man’s expression was indifferent as he waved.

“Hmph.” Han Lihui’s face darkened, eyeing the man. A grade-level martial art—too tempting.

Yet he recalled the man’s power. For years, city guardians had patrolled Beichang County, turning it into a prison where entry was allowed but exit forbidden. Once, someone reached Soul-Transcending Realm and tried to escape for revenge, but the guardian intercepted them, slicing them in half and hanging their body on the gate. No one dared defy the walls since.

“Leave! This kid isn’t worth your trouble! Even if you kill him today, Beichang County will be bloodbathed tomorrow. I saved you!”

The crowd’s faces turned incredulous. They’d suspected the kid was formidable, but never imagined he terrified even the guardian.

“Don’t fear! I’ll personally deal with you!” A weak voice echoed as Luo Tian staggered up, his face pale.

Though battered, his Bone-Devouring Mid-Stage cultivation and pills allowed him to stand. His back ached as if shattered, blood mixed with internal fragments spewing from his mouth. He glared at the fifty Bone-Devouring Realm masters, their fear palpable.

“Wait for me! I’ll return soon. Today’s grudge, I’ll remember!” Luo Tian’s confidence shone despite his injuries.

The crowd grimaced—this once pitiful youth now threatened them. His fierce gaze stirred unease.

Huang Tianrui, among the crowd, smiled inwardly. He’d avoided greed; the attack had been symbolic. No hostility in Luo Tian’s eyes.

“Go!” Han Lihui hesitated, calling to Han Xu. He knew the guardian’s presence made capturing Luo Tian impossible.

Zhao’s father and son, seeing Han leave, grimaced as they headed toward Beiming City.

“Damn it!” Mao Xingxiu’s face twisted with frustration, but he had no choice. Even the three clans retreated; a lone cultivator could only retreat.

Others, wary of death, left Beichang County. Though they lived on the edge of life, they weren’t fools—fighting the guardian was suicide.

“Kid, I didn’t expect you to be a three-element talent!” The man landed before Luo Tian, smiling.

“Thank you for your aid, respected elder. May I know your name? I’ll repay you someday!” Luo Tian bowed weakly, gratitude in his eyes.

“I’m Ding Hongfei. No need for thanks; you’re a Yul Ling Sect disciple, and my words were truthful. If you died here, they’d all perish too. I saved them,” the man smiled gently.

Luo Tian marveled at Yul Ling Sect’s power, their strength enough to protect a Bone-Devouring Realm novice.

Hearing Ding Hongfei’s words, Luo Tian sighed internally. He didn’t know why the man assumed he was a Yul Ling Sect disciple, but now he couldn’t deny it—displeasing Ding Hongfei would be fatal.

“With your three-element body, you must hold a high rank in the sect. Why so desperate? You were teleported into Beichang County?” Ding Hongfei’s tone was curious.

“It’s part of the sect’s trial. I acquired a grade-level martial art and escaped,” Luo Tian explained, deflecting the issue to the sect.

Hearing “grade-level martial art,” Ding Hongfei’s pupils contracted slightly, his gaze on Luo Tian. Even Soul-Transcending Realm masters wouldn’t remain calm at such a treasure.

But it lasted only a moment before he smiled: “Well, what’s your plan now? Stay here to recover or have the sect send someone?”

“Stay here? Have them fetch me? I’d be suicidal!” Luo Tian mentally sighed, his face grim. “Respected elder, the sect’s mission was to return to them. I must go alone and within a deadline!”

“Ah… you’re not in shape for now. How about staying with me to recover?” Ding Hongfei offered.

Chapter 311: Leng Qiuchan’s踪迹

“No bother, respected elder! This wound isn’t serious!” Luo Tian sighed, declining. He needed to recover but couldn’t stay—risking exposure and angering the Soul-Transcending Realm master.

Yet he had no choice; he released Wu Di and Dragon Baby from the Nascent Soul Bag. If he didn’t, Dragon Baby would’ve rebelled.

“Brother!” Dragon Baby’s eyes welled as he emerged, his innocent gaze betraying委屈. The Nascent Soul Bag was dark, but Dragon Baby’s childish fear of darkness clashed with Wu Di’s terror.

Dragon Baby’s chaotic movements nearly killed Wu Di, who felt his life would end if touched by the child.

“Hmph.” Wu Di sighed, relieved until he saw Ding Hongfei’s piercing gaze. His first encounter with a Soul-Transcending Realm master left him trembling.

“Yawn…” Dragon Baby yawned, looking at Luo Tian with a pout.

“It’s time,” Luo Tian sighed, his face grim. Each time he unsealed the seal, danger followed—never fully releasing Dragon Baby before. He’d promised to let him play often.

“Brother, can I stay longer?” Dragon Baby tugged Luo Tian’s sleeve, pleading.

Though his strength was minimal, it made Luo Tian dizzy, blood spilling again.

“Okay, Dragon Baby. I promise when we reach a fun place, you’ll play all you want!” Luo Tian gently patted Dragon Baby’s head.

“Okay! I’m going back!” Dragon Baby nodded, golden light enveloping his small body as he returned to the Nirvana Dragon Seal.

“Seal?” Ding Hongfei sensed Dragon Baby’s power instantly—this child was stronger than Bone-Devouring Realm masters.

As he spoke, Luo Tian’s cultivation dropped to Body-Cultivation Ninth Stage. Even Ding Hongfei was stunned, muttering: “Yul Ling Sect’s seal techniques are indeed formidable. But this is too harsh—locking a Bone-Devouring Realm disciple into Body-Cultivation Ninth Stage and sending him here?”

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian coughed, his face flushed. He mentally cursed: “I didn’t want to be sealed at Body-Cultivation Ninth Stage!”

He sighed, smiling bitterly: “No choice; the sect’s rules.”

“Wait—last time I met a girl and three subordinates. She wasn’t even at Bone-Devouring Realm, but Body-Cultivation Ninth Stage—no seal aura!” Ding Hongfei frowned.

“Leng Qiuchan! They’ve been here too!” Luo Tian’s face lit up. “Respected elder, have you seen my little sister? A black-clad masked woman?”

“Exactly! She was strange—refused to reveal her whereabouts. I only met her when she faced danger in Beichang County,” Ding Hongfei mused. Leng Qiuchan had dual-element (dark and wood) cultivation, while this kid was triple-element. Yul Ling Sect truly dominated the Eastern Region.

“Respected elder, she’s my little sister. She sneaked out. My other mission was to find her. Though the Eastern Region is vast, I didn’t expect this,” Luo Tian beamed. Leng Qiuchan must belong to Yul Ling Sect—finding her meant she’d know where the teleportation array was, allowing him to return to the Northern Region.

“I don’t know. That girl was cold—she thanked me and left. She gave me a Nascent Soul Bag to carry fierce beasts. So when you used it, I confirmed you’re from Yul Ling Sect,” Ding Hongfei said.

“Oh… then it’s fine. Respected elder, could you tell me nearby cities? I’ll find one to rest and recover!” Luo Tian’s face fell, asking for a map. He guessed Ding Hongfei was a top-tier strength here; having a map would aid his travels.

“I’ll escort you partway. Only a hundred li, then you can walk half a day,” Ding Hongfei said, handing Luo Tian a jade slip. His eyes widened—Luo Tian’s wounds were healing rapidly, even his torn back showing signs of recovery.

But he ignored it, gesturing Luo Tian to grab him. Wu Di was less fortunate—Ding Hongfei sealed him again, then took off with his wings.

Chapter 312: In Lishui City

A hundred li took mere breaths for a Soul-Transcending Realm master.

“Hmph.” Wind howled as Ding Hongfei appeared beside a hill, releasing Luo Tian and Wu Di.

“Goodbye. I can only take you this far. Southward is Lishui City. Give this letter to its governor, Ding Yanshan—he’ll host you. If trouble arises, he’ll help,” Ding Hongfei smiled.

“Thank you, respected elder. If you ever need aid, I’ll do my best!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully.

Ding Hongfei’s eyes gleamed—this was the outcome he desired. He smiled again: “If trouble arises here, come find me. I’ll help as much as I can.”

“Hmph. Respected elder, I must go to Lishui City. Though my wounds are healing, they’ll take a few days,” Luo Tian bowed again, cautious of suspicion.

“Hmph. I must return. Also, beware of Beichang County’s people. Though they won’t leave here, it doesn’t mean others’ guardians will let them out. Be careful,” Ding Hongfei vanished, his voice echoing in Luo Tian’s ears.

“This flying sensation is amazing!” Luo Tian envied, watching Ding Hongfei disappear.

“Respected elder, with your talent, you’ll surely reach the Soul-Transcending Realm… even surpass it!” Wu Di gazed at Luo Tian, admiration in his eyes.

“Soul-Transcending Realm? Seems insufficient,” Luo Tian mused, recalling Master Qingmu’s words about achieving the legendary Boundary Lord Realm to resurrect people.

“Hmph.” Wu Di was speechless—Soul-Transcending Realm was like heaven to him. Yet Luo Tian deemed it inadequate. He didn’t even know what lay beyond Soul-Transcending Realm.

“Respected elder, how do we proceed?” Wu Di asked, puzzled. He’d never left Beichang County; the outside world was foreign to him. With Luo Tian as his protector, he wouldn’t abandon cultivation.

“First, Lishui City,” Luo Tian mused, then led Wu Di into the city.

After a day’s journey, they reached Lishui City’s towering walls, their awe evident. “Why are all these city walls so high?”

They entered the city, encountering few people—first-timers in the Eastern Region.

The streets felt fresh and comfortable compared to Beichang County’s Beiming City. Ordinary people mingled with cultivators, creating harmony.

“This is the Eastern Region’s city? It truly surpasses the Northern Region!” Luo Tian marveled, sensing cultivators everywhere from Body-Cultivation First to Ninth Stage. In the North, even a Body-Cultivation Ninth Stage could be a city’s ruler—like Zhang Hongyun’s father. Beiming City was mid-tier in the North.

As they walked, Luo Tian recalled his promise to Dragon Baby. Lishui City was perfect—lively and bustling.

He found a secluded spot, pressed the Dragon Emperor’s Reverse Scale to his hand, and golden light flared. Dragon Baby appeared before him.

“Brother, you just came out! Why again?” Dragon Baby eyed the surroundings warily. Though small, he knew every time Luo Tian unsealed the seal, it was for battle. He scanned for danger.

After seeing only Wu Di’s weak form, he frowned at Luo Tian.

“Didn’t you keep begging to play? Today I’ll take you out!” Luo Tian smiled, gently patting Dragon Baby’s head.

Hearing “play,” Dragon Baby’s face lit up—his natural curiosity had only seen Luo Tian fight or escape. He longed to explore the world.

“Brother, you’re the best! Haha! Tremble, people—Dragon Baby is coming!” Dragon Baby stood proudly, his tiny hands on his hips.

Wu Di was awestruck by Dragon Baby’s aura.

Luo Tian sighed, regretting releasing Dragon Baby. With his nature, Lishui City would be in chaos.

“Let’s go for a walk,” he said, and Dragon Baby darted off like a whirlwind, eager to explore the human world.

“Brother, I want this! Brother, I want that too! Uncle, take it, I want this!” Dragon Baby grabbed everything indiscriminately, leaving Luo Tian to pay with a苦笑. Fortunately, he had enough resources—otherwise, no one could withstand Dragon Baby’s spending.

Wu Di suffered more; Dragon Baby’s speed was terrifying. Often, one item hadn’t been stored before another was grabbed.

“Haha! So fun!” Dragon Baby smiled, holding a string of candied haws like a little emperor as he strode through the streets.

Chapter 313: Crimson-Clad Woman

As Dragon Baby played, on the other side of Lishui City, a jewelry shop hosted two women laughing over a jade bracelet.

“Miss, you’re so beautiful—everything suits you!” A maid smiled at a tall woman.

“You flatter too much! I’ll take both, keep one each!” The crimson-clad woman playfully smacked the maid.

The maid stuck out her tongue, gazing at her mistress—though a servant, she was treated as a sister. She knew her mistress’s arrogance stemmed from her talent: at twenty-three, she’d reached Bone-Devouring Realm Initial Stage. Her father was Lishui City’s governor, and she’d grown up in flattery, making arrogance a habit.

“Miss, I heard the clan’s exchange quota contest will be held here soon. Your lover is coming!” The maid smiled.

“Little brat, are you trying to die?” The crimson woman blushed, yanking the maid’s ear.

Their antics made other jewelry shoppers feel inferior, muttering: “A fox spirit reincarnated!” But they dared not say more—this woman held terrifying power in Lishui City.
