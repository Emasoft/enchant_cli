“Who is the Tianyu you mentioned? Come out! Don’t be a coward. I want to see how strong your Fire Domain’s prodigy is!” Sun Feiwen sneered, his golden long spear radiating cold light. He barked at Lu Tianyu’s group.

“I am!” Lu Tianyu, a prodigy of the era, could not bear being insulted. He brandished his blue sword and stepped forward, eyes burning with battle spirit as he gazed at Sun Feiwen.

“Die!” Sun Feiwen ignored Lu Tianyu’s presence, his sword flashing. A thunderous blade surged toward him.

Lu Tianyu was no pushover. He twirled his blue sword, its light slicing through the void as it clashed with Sun Feiwen’s blade. The sky roared like lightning colliding, dazzling all present.

“Fire Domain’s brat has some skill!” The Demon Clan’s people exchanged glances, recognizing Sun Feiwen’s strength. As the eternal foes of the Divine Clan, they knew his power—rumors claimed he once clashed with a Sage in its early stages.

The Thunder Domain’s people also stiffened. Their prodigy Li Tianming furrowed his brows, eyes filled with suspicion. Though they had looked down on the Fire Domain, Lu Tianyu’s ability to block Sun Feiwen’s attack surprised them.

“Good. Blocking my casual strike earns you the title of prodigy,” Sun Feiwen’s expression lightened, his fingers brushing his golden sword.

Lu Tianyu’s eyes darkened. He felt the terrifying fluctuations from Sun Feiwen’s strike, barely managing to block it with effort.

“Only Lu Tian can handle him,” Lu Tianyu mused, glancing at Lu Tian. Yet Lu Tian’s identity remained hidden.

Lu Tian stood still, marveling at the Divine Clan’s strength. Five early-stage Sages faced them, but what unsettled him was the mid-stage Sage among them. He knew he wasn’t ready for that level.

“Don’t push too hard, or I won’t be polite,” Lu Tian muttered coldly, scanning the group.

“Hmph!” Those caught in his gaze shivered, feeling an icy chill.

As Sun Feiwen’s sword descended again, its might overwhelming, Lu Tianyu tensed. He flung his sword skyward and chanted: “Nine Heavens Sword God Scripture!” Nine blue swords materialized, swirling into a storm that sent Sun Feiwen’s expression darkening.

“Underestimated you,” Sun Feiwen admitted, unleashing his third strike. His golden sword expanded as he conjured two golden hands to wield it.

Both Half-Sages clashed, their swords splitting the sky. A thunderous sound echoed as Lu Tianyu’s storm was cleaved, scattering into winds. Though Sun Feiwen’s sword faltered momentarily, it still descended toward Lu Tianyu.

“Tianyu, danger!” Du Yuying gasped, regretting her meddling.

Lu Han and Du Hongtao’s faces paled. They wanted to intervene, but the five early-stage Sages and one mid-stage Sage watched them coldly.

In a flash, Lu Tian appeared before Lu Tianyu without using divine power. His body radiated blue energy, forming a dragon-shaped illusion that shielded him.

“Foolish! Fire Domain’s arrogance is unbearable. A mere Transcendent dares block a Half-Sage?” The crowd sneered at Lu Tian’s altered appearance.

Lu Han and Du Hongtao sighed in relief. They knew Lu Tian’s strength—neither could match him, so Lu Tianyu was safe.

Sun Feiwen’s sword struck Lu Tian, clanging sharply. He blocked with his body alone, recoiling and sending both flying.

“Hmph! Strong physique!” Sun Feiwen’s interest piqued. Though battered, Lu Tian and Lu Tianyu bore no real wounds.

The Demon Clan gaped. How could a mere Transcendent block Sun Feiwen’s Three Sword Techniques?

“Let it go. Don’t force a fight,” Lu Tian said, landing before Sun Feiwen.

“Hah! What are you? Blocking my attack makes you worthy of speaking? You’re just a Transcendent worm. I’ll show you what ‘fight to the death’ means!” Sun Feiwen scoffed, raising his sword again.

“You forced me,” Lu Tian’s eyes turned cold. He waved his hand, golden light swirling in it.

“Hmph!” The stars trembled as the crowd gasped. A scorching heat filled the void.

Chapter 927: Beast Domain Auction

Beyond the Beast Domain’s Holy City, Lu Tian’s golden light radiated. A fresh breeze emanated from his palm, stirring the beasts around him with excitement and longing.

Sun Feiwen frowned. As a Divine Clan prodigy, he recognized the golden elixir as a Sage-grade初级 (Primary) Elixir. But why would Lu Tian reveal it now?

“Though I’m weaker, I am a Sage-grade mid-level Alchemist. Master Du and Master Lu are also Sage-grade mid-level Alchemists. Lu Tianyu and Du Yuying can craft Sage-grade初级 Elixirs,” Lu Tian smiled, rolling the golden elixir in his palm.

“So what? A Sage-grade mid-level Alchemist?” Sun Feiwen sneered. “We Divine Clan have many. Alchemists are precious to others, but we see them as nothing. You think your Alchemist status will save you?”

“Indeed, the Divine Clan is proud. But remember—this is the Beast Domain, not the Divine-Mortal Domain!” Lu Tian remained calm, scanning the beasts.

“Beast Domain friends, help me eliminate this Divine Clan trash. I’ll reward you! These are yours—more still await!” Lu Tian’s voice rang out.

He waved his hand, golden elixirs flying into the sky like a river of stars. The crowd gasped at the sheer number.

“Such abundance!” The Demon Clan and Thunder Domain’s people marveled, stunned by the golden elixir river.

“Fire Domain truly excels in alchemy! Though not top-tier, their alchemical prowess is unmatched,” Li Xingteng of the Thunder Domain sighed.

A beast roared, charging toward Lu Tian’s elixirs.

“Is this true?” A black gorilla asked, eyes burning with desire.

“Beast Domain’s strength is limited. Alchemy is our pride. Fire Domain keeps promises—help us, and we’ll share these elixirs!”

“Don’t think your weakness lets you steal our elixirs. I can destroy them at will,” Lu Tian smiled confidently.

Lu Tian had learned from Xizhen and Xizhuang that Beast Domain beasts valued elixirs. Their reactions confirmed it.

“Sage-grade elixirs! I’ve never seen one!” A beast drooled, eyes greedy. Without Lu Tian’s words, they might have stolen them.

“Do it! Divine Clan trash won’t dare attack us!” Beasts roared, sending signals.

After messages, beasts turned fierce, charging the Divine Clan.

“Damn it!” The Divine Clan’s faces darkened. They hadn’t expected Lu Tian to bribe beasts.

Chaos erupted as beasts surrounded the Divine Clan. Though powerful, they hesitated after past lessons, enduring beast attacks without retaliation.

Boom! Beasts surrounded the Divine Clan again. All eyes turned to Lu Tian, the Fire Domain prodigy behind it.

A massive black gorilla emerged with its clan.

“Sage-grade beast!” Lu Tian marveled.

“Hah! Our ape clan has arrived!” The gorilla laughed, smashing a Half-Sage Divine Clan prodigy.

“Unexpectedly, your ape clan came first!” A thunderous voice echoed as a blue bird with 100-zhang wings joined.

“Hah! We’re not late, right?” A rhinoceros charged like a flood.

A cacophony of roars filled the sky as thousands of beasts overwhelmed it. People trembled, fear gripping them.

“Terrifying! Beast Domain is truly formidable. Though second to Divine-Mortal, alone, the Divine Clan would lose,” a Demon elder muttered.

“Divine Clan’s misfortune. Alchemists are so valued here!” Li Xingteng sighed, a hint of schadenfreude.

Sage-grade beasts arrived. The Divine Clan’s faces darkened further. Previous attacks had humiliated them, but with these beasts joining, they’d be doomed.

“Beast Domain elders, will you let us perish here? Start a war?” The mid-stage Sage elder finally spoke.

“Hah! Divine Clan isn’t so proud!” Beasts snarled, eyes filled with disdain.

They gazed at Lu Tian’s elixir river. Even Sage-grade beasts showed desire.

“True!” Beasts felt reassured. Killing a few Divine Clan members for so many elixirs was worth it.

“Kill these Divine trash!” Beast leaders ordered.

Roars filled the sky as beasts attacked, threatening to devour the Divine Clan.

“Beast Domain elders, stop before we unleash violence!” The Divine Clan’s anger boiled. They’d retaliate.

“Enough…” An old voice echoed. Eight powerful auras rose, their authority silencing the beasts.

Light flared as eight figures emerged—four Sage-grade late-stage, four mid-stage. People marveled.

“Respect the Eight Clan Leaders!” Beasts bowed, obeying.

The mid-stage Sage elder sighed. He knew these were the current leaders of the Holy City’s Eight Clans.

The phoenix elder smiled, leading the group. “Everyone, disperse. You’re guests here. Why fight? All seek the Ancient Palace. Don’t waste strength!”

Lu Tian’s brows furrowed, his eyes flashing purple. He saw the Eight Clans’ true forms.

“Dragon Clan, Phoenix Clan, Eagle Clan, Tiger Clan…” He knew the Beast Domain was their extension.

The mystery of the Dragon Clan leader standing behind the Phoenix elder puzzled him. The Dragon Clan’s pride made this odd.

Long Jie stood, confused. He felt a familiar connection to the Dragon Clan elder, yet it felt like a junior.

“Disperse! The Ancient Palace opens soon. Rest in the Holy City, but no trouble!” The phoenix elder spoke calmly.

“Also, a grand auction will be held fifteen days later. All domains’ strength is welcome!” His gaze swept the crowd, lingering on Lu Tian’s elixir river.

Chapter 928: Rhino Clan

The phoenix elder’s words caused a stir. “Auction?” People wondered why the Palace’s opening time would host one.

But they soon understood. Domains except the Mortal Domain gathered in the Holy City. The Beast Domain’s treasures needed exchange, a win-win for acquiring what they lacked—like elixirs.

“Fire Domain’s young friend, visit my Phoenix Clan. We value Alchemists greatly!” The phoenix elder smiled.

Lu Tian felt a chill, yet bowed respectfully. “If time permits, I’ll visit.”

“Hah! Then we take our leave!” The phoenix elder led the others back.

“Kid, you’ve angered us. Wait,” the Divine Clan sneered, eyes burning with hatred.

“Hah! Not done yet. Continue!” Lu Tian remained calm, handing elixirs to other beast leaders.

“Thanks!” Beast leaders took them, eyes hostile toward the Divine Clan.

“Little brother, we’ve done nothing. It’s a shame to trouble you,” the ape leader smiled, patting his chest.

“Indeed! Little brother, our leopard clan welcomes you… our rhino clan will help!” Roars echoed.

“Thank you, elders. I’ll visit,” Lu Tian bowed, focusing on the rhino clan’s leader. He handed them Xizhen and Xizhuang’s tokens.

“Elders, we met the rhino clan’s two prodigies upon entering. These are Xizhen and Xizhuang’s tokens!” Lu Tian smiled.

“Oh! I remember. Those two brats were guarding the Fire Domain’s entrance. Didn’t trouble you?” The rhino leader blushed.

“No, we just had a friendly duel!” Lu Tian shook his head.

“Good. Since you’re our people, follow us. No one will harm you,” the rhino leader patted Lu Tian’s shoulder.

“Then I’ll trouble you!” Lu Tian signaled his group, following the rhino clan.

Lu Tian’s strength lagged behind the Divine Clan. He sought the rhino clan’s protection to avoid trouble, planning to enter the Ancient Palace after. Three clans were marked for elimination, their lineages to end.

The Divine Clan’s faces darkened. A rhino clan was insignificant, but in the Beast Domain, conflict with beasts was forbidden.

“Luck,” they muttered, eyes burning. They watched Lu Tian and the rhino leader laughing.

Lu Han and Du Hongtao sighed, admiration in their eyes. Lu Tian had surpassed them, handling everything independently.

“Though ancient Tianshu was brilliant, I think today’s Lu Tian equals him,” Du Hongtao hoped to see Lu Tian lead the Fire Domain in the Nine Domains.

Other clans envied the rhino clan. They knew Lu Tian’s group had several Sage-grade Alchemists, a temptation for beasts.

“Elders, my words hold. Once in the Holy City, visit our rhino clan for elixirs until the Ancient Palace opens. If time runs out, I’ll make up for it,” Lu Tian bowed, entering the Holy City with the rhino clan.

“Wait, kid. Angering us means death,” the Divine Clan muttered, watching Lu Tian’s confidence.

……

The rhino clan, beneath the Eight Clans, had a territory in the Holy City. Lu Tian’s group was treated as honored guests.

A thousand miles of land belonged to the rhino clan. No other clans intruded.

“Little brother, beasts aren’t formal. If we offend you, forgive us,” the rhino clan’s leader smiled in a grand hall, food and wine flowing.

“Too much!” Lu Tian marveled at the rhino leader’s brother, Xihongda, devouring a meat thicker than his leg and drinking from a bowl bigger than his face.

“Hah! A rare human!” Xihongda liked Lu Tian more.

Gu Lei and Zheng Xin quickly bonded with the rhino clan, becoming brothers. Especially Chen Zhanbiao, whose appetite stunned even the rhinos.

After a joyous feast, they returned to their quarters.

Lu Tian’s head felt heavy, cheeks flushed. He walked to a spacious room, his drunkenness unrelieved.

A small figure appeared before him. Du Yuying glared, cheeks red, eyes sharp.

Lu Tian smiled, patting his head. “Little girl, what’s wrong?”

“Why don’t you like me? Am I ugly?” Du Yuying stammered, cheeks red. She’d drunk during dinner.

Lu Tian smiled, knowing her admiration was childish. “You’re young. Wait until you grow up.”

“Don’t care! I’ll marry you!” Du Yuying lunged, stumbling.

Lu Tian caught her. “We’re not meant to be. Look around—maybe someone better.”

“Don’t! I want you!” Du Yuying pouted, shaking Lu Tian.

“Be a good girl. I see you as my sister,” Lu Tian nearly vomited, steadying her.

He knew Du Yuying loved Lu Tianyu. Her panic when he was in danger hadn’t escaped him.

Maybe tired or drunk, she closed her eyes. Yet she whispered Lu Tian’s name, then “Tianyu brother,” making him sigh.

“Come out!” Lu Tian carried her, smiling into the night.

Lu Tianyu emerged awkwardly. “Take care of her,” Lu Tian handed Du Yuying to him.

“Don’t let the sect’s rules bother you. Why can’t we marry?” Lu Tian patted his shoulder, returning to his room.

“Thanks,” Lu Tianyu gazed at him before carrying Du Yuing away.

Unseen, tears fell on the ground.

Chapter 929: Divine Princess Sun Mengru

Lu Tian returned to his room, meditating. He planned next steps in the Beast Domain.

“Beast Domain differs from Fire Domain. Many strong ones, other domains’ masters. Until entering the Ancient Palace, the Divine Clan won’t stop. With the rhino clan’s protection, it should be fine.”

“Also, Yun Ting—my intuition says we’ll meet soon. Continue searching. If I exit the Ancient Palace, find her. With Long Jie, exiting is safe.”

He pondered all night, no cultivation. He knew to tread carefully; one mistake meant ruin.

Fire Domain had Gu Tianshu’s support, but in the Beast Domain, he relied on himself.

After a night of thought, Lu Tian opened his eyes. The drunkenness faded. He activated the Zhentian Vessel, apologizing for forgetting to free Zhao Fengshan and his wife after becoming a Sage.

“Master Zhao, I’ll find suitable bodies for you in the Ancient Palace. Then free you and elevate you,” Lu Tian’s eyes burned with intent.

The Zhentian Vessel trembled. Zhao Fengshan’s voice echoed, confirming no harm.

“Hah! Lu little brother, we’re visiting!” A rough voice echoed. Beefy figures entered his courtyard.

“Sorry for the wait. I’ll start alchemy. Give your elixirs to my friends—collect them before the auction!” Lu Tian smiled, greeting the men.

Gu Lei and others were moved in, becoming laborers.

Compared to Gu Lei’s group, Du Hongtao, Lu Han, Lu Tianyu, and Du Yuying were assigned alchemy tasks.

“Lu Tian, I can also make elixirs. Let me help!” Gu Lei grinned.

“Get lost!” Lu Tian kicked him away. Gu Lei could make elixirs, but his “toxic” ones were notorious.

Seven days passed. The rhino clan’s territory echoed with thunder, Sage-grade elixir trials. The rhino clan’s masters were grateful.

Other clans also came, leaving happy. Lu Tian treated all equally, giving more to those who hadn’t helped.

The rhino clan was happiest. As his base, he gave them endless elixirs.

Soon, five Sage-grade Alchemists in the rhino clan spread rumors. Beasts flocked to them.

Seven days of non-stop alchemy yielded results. Beast clans were straightforward, repaying kindness. Most beasts vowed to help Lu Tian.

Lu Tian’s name spread, reaching the Divine Clan. Their hatred deepened.

“Hmph! That kid is Lu Tian. Dead man walking!” Divine Clan elders glared, teeth clenched.

“Deal with him? Can’t attack in the Beast Domain. His alchemy is too strong! Those beasts are grateful,” Sun Feiwen seethed, eyeing the rhino clan.

Enemy of Lu Tian, no beast welcomed the Divine Clan. Even inns refused them. The proud Divine Clan slept outdoors, eating at back alleys—humiliated.

“Hah! What’s wrong? You look pitiful,” a gentle voice echoed. An elder with a youth appeared.

“Great Elder…!” The Divine Clan’s faces lit up, bowing.

“Why so gloomy?” The Great Elder Sun Hewei, a late-stage Sage, rarely left the clan. They knew he came for the youth.

The Divine Clan’s princess, a unique figure. Though her power was low, she ranked near the Great Elder.

This time, Sun Mengru ascended to Nine Sources Supreme. They dared not disrespect her. Even in the Ancient Palace, her words were absolute.

“Speak,” Sun Hewei smiled, addressing the angry Divine Clan.

“Great Elder, it’s this…” A mid-stage Sage elder explained. When mentioning Lu Tian, Sun Hewei’s brows furrowed.
