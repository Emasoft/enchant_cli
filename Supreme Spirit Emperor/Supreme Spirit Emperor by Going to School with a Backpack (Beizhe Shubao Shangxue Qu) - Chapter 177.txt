“Alright, from now on, you need not call me master. You may address me by my name or refer to me as Deputy Sect Leader Luo! Either is acceptable!” Luo Tian looked at the tens of thousands bowing before him with a faint sense of exasperation, speaking softly.

The term “master” felt utterly awkward to Luo Tian, especially after those dozen elders had made him feel so uncomfortable.

“Ma Yingming, from now on, you shall be the head of the Enforcement Hall in Tianyuan Sect. All internal and external matters of the sect may be handled by you when the Sect Leader is absent!” Luo Tian spoke, immediately placing the burden on Ma Yingming’s shoulders.

Luo Tian knew that Ma Yingming and Tu Hongfei were a perfect pair of intellect and might, both truly capable of managing the sect. He had not withheld authority merely because they had recently pledged allegiance to him.

A bitter smile crossed Ma Yingming’s face as he silently sighed, realizing that his life would not be as轻松 as he had imagined.

Under Ma Yingming’s organization, no one remained on Tiger Prison Star; all evacuated it. At the same time, the ten thousand界尊 disciples brought by Luo Tian from the Tianyuan Sect arrived as scheduled, securing Tiger Prison Star.

“Hmph. Not a single prisoner remains on Tiger Prison Star—what if this news spreads? It might scare the other sects!” Tu Hongfei commented as prisoners exited Tiger Prison Star.

“With these people, our Tianyuan Sect’s strength should no longer fear the Four Great Sects!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with determination, silently marveling at his growing power.

The Tianyuan Sect now had numerous disciples, plus the several sects like Longya Pavilion he had subjugated. With Tiger Prison Star added, the total number reached a terrifying two to three million—especially these people from Tiger Prison Star were fierce tigers, with many capable of surpassing their rank.

“嗡……” A series of vibrations emanated from Luo Tian’s storage ring, transmitting a message into his mind. His previously good mood instantly darkened.

“Duan Shen Cliff! There’s trouble! Hurry!”

“Master, the sect is in crisis. Return quickly!” Two voices—Jiang Sxi and Jiang Yimeng—entered Luo Tian’s mind almost simultaneously.

“Phoenix Sect, White Tiger Sect—you’ve struck early!” Luo Tian muttered under his breath, eyes brimming with killing intent.

“What’s wrong?” Nan Gong Yuqing and others noticed Luo Tian’s intense hostility and asked.

“Ma Yingming, Tu Hongfei—take everyone to the Tianyuan Sect. If there’s trouble, kill without mercy!” Luo Tian had no time to explain further; he quickly issued orders to Tu Hongfei, handing him his token.

“Nan Gong Xiong, take your subordinates and follow me to Duan Shen Cliff!” Luo Tian’s voice carried endless coldness as he vanished from sight.

Chapter 824: Duan Shen Cliff

After issuing his commands, Luo Tian vanished from the spot, urgency driving him toward Duan Shen Cliff. He understood Jiang Sxi’s character—unless desperate, she would never send such a plea.

Nan Gong Yuqing saw Luo Tian’s darkened expression and knew this had touched his底线. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been so desperate.

“Do as Luo Tian said,” Nan Gong Yuqing murmured, leading several subordinates into a crimson streak of light, chasing after Luo Tian.

“Haha! Great—this outburst allows us to kill. Truly exhilarating!” The prisoners from Tiger Prison Star laughed aloud, flexing their fists and shouting as they flew toward the Tianyuan Sect.

“Four Sacred Stars will be in chaos!” Chen He Guang stood still, a bitter smile on his face as he watched the two groups fly in opposite directions. He sighed deeply.

Since all prisoners had left Tiger Prison Star, Chen He Guang had no reason to stay. His gaze held a complex emotion as he led the two or three thousand disciples of Xuanwu Sect toward their home, leaving the starry void silent once more.

...

Duan Shen Cliff, a place akin to an abyss within the Four Sacred Stars. Now, thunderous explosions echoed at its perimeter as dazzling martial arts techniques exploded in the sky, shattering vast stretches of void.

A towering cliff stood before them. At its mid-slope, Jiang Sxi’s face was cold as she watched her nearly ten thousand Supreme Rank disciples fighting against an opposing force, each falling under their enemies’ blows. Her heart ached.

After leading her people to Duan Shen Cliff with the残图, Jiang Sxi had stopped at the mid-slope. She felt a life-threatening danger if she continued upward, and her fragment only reached this point.

Though merely the mid-slope, Jiang Sxi was already satisfied. Duan Shen Cliff was immense with countless opportunities; within days, half of her ten thousand disciples had ascended in rank.

But the good fortune didn’t last. Soon after, trouble arrived—White Tiger Sect had learned Jiang Sxi led Tianyuan Sect disciples to Duan Shen Cliff.

The White Tiger Sect Master Jin Yongsi led his sect’s disciples and numerous affiliated sects—100,000 in total—to trap Jiang Sxi’s group at Duan Shen Cliff, constantly attacking.

Fortunately, Duan Shen Cliff was defensible and Tianyuan Sect disciples had many who ascended in rank, slowing the White Tiger Sect’s advance. Otherwise, Jiang Sxi’s group would have been crushed by three waves of White Tiger Sect disciples.

“Master, we can’t hold out much longer!” A disciple who had just ascended to Five Source Supreme Rank looked terrified, watching the White Tiger Sect disciples attacking below and Tianyuan Sect disciples falling. He addressed Jiang Sxi.

“Hold for one day. I’ve already sent a message to Luo Tian. He’ll arrive soon. If he doesn’t come within a day, we’ll retreat upward. I want to see if Jin Yongsi dares follow!” Jiang Sxi’s face was cold, her gaze on the mist-veiled mountain.

“Luo Tian!” Hearing Jiang Sxi had sent a message, the Tianyuan Sect disciples’ faces lit up with excitement. They thought of the man who had repeatedly created miracles.

“Hold on! Luo Tian’s reinforcements are coming soon. When they arrive, we’ll surround these White Tiger Sect scum!” The disciple shouted, his voice echoing in every battle-worn disciple’s ears.

“Luo Tian!” The Tianyuan Sect disciples roared his name like a drug, their bodies radiating powerful fluctuations as they charged at the White Tiger Sect disciples.

“Luo Tian? I hope you come quickly!” Jin Yongsi’s face curled into a smile, his gaze filled with mockery as he looked into the distance.

“Is that the boy you’ve never managed to subdue?” A young man beside Jin Yongsi asked, disdain evident in his voice.

The youth radiated golden light, his expression seemingly calm but exuding an overwhelming arrogance. It seemed time itself was inferior to him.

“Indeed, that’s the slippery little rat. When he first arrived in the Four Sacred Stars, he was merely a界尊. In just a few years, he’s grown to Eight Source Supreme Rank—his power is terrifying. Now he’s established himself,” Jin Yongsi said, admiration in his voice as he recalled Luo Tian’s growth.

“Hmph. Genius—my favorite targets are geniuses. Crushing them beneath my feet is truly delightful!” The youth’s golden light flared as he caressed his golden sword, his tone still haughty.

Jin Yongsi inwardly sneered: “If it weren’t for your father, I’d never bother with this Eight Source Supreme Rank!”

Though he despised the youth, Jin Yongsi smiled: “Of course. Jiang Sxi is unbeatable at her rank. But be careful—this boy even escaped us both!”

“Enough. I’m more interested in the traitor of our Divine Clan. Capturing her would please the elders. I never expected to meet her here in the Four Sacred Stars!” The youth’s face lit with excitement, his gaze on Duan Shen Cliff.

The battle continued, blood staining the cliff. Though the Tianyuan Sect disciples were valiant, their numbers were too few. After a day of struggle, the original ten thousand dwindled to half, and deaths continued ceaselessly.

“Blood Qi… Life Essence…” A low voice echoed within Duan Shen Cliff’s rock, calm and faint, drowned by the battlefield’s chaos. No one heard it—neither Jin Yongsi nor Jiang Sxi noticed this low voice.

Yet both were puzzled by the phenomenon: after nearly ten thousand deaths, there was no blood river—only traces of blood clung to the cliff walls, as if countless blood had vanished.

They attributed this mystery to Duan Shen Cliff’s enigma.

“Master, we can’t hold out!” A Five Source Supreme Rank disciple, his body bloodied with a deep wound on his chest, approached Jiang Sxi.

Jiang Sxi furrowed her brows, watching the Tianyuan Sect disciples resembling bloodied men. She sighed, as if making a decision, then softly said: “Prepare to retreat upward!”

The disciples exhaled in relief. Ten thousand against ten times their number, and the White Tiger Sect—one of the Four Great Sects—this feat was enough to pride themselves.

The remaining five thousand roared, gathering together to charge upward with Jiang Sxi.

“Haha, finally on the right path?” Jin Yongsi saw the Tianyuan Sect’s group assembling and smiled with a scheming look, instructing his subordinates to not intensify the attack but instead slow it.

“Master Jin’s strategy is truly brilliant. Let the Tianyuan Sect clear the path for us, exploring Duan Shen Cliff!” As Jin Yongsi sneered, a cold voice echoed from the cliff.

“Luo Tian!” Jiang Sxi’s body froze, relief on her face as she halted her step.

The Tianyuan Sect disciples’ faces lit up with excitement at Luo Tian’s voice, their gazes turning to the sky as two streaks of light cleaved through the heavens.

Hearing Luo Tian’s voice, Jin Yongsi’s sneer faltered. Luo Tian was right—Jin Yongsi had indeed planned this, otherwise he wouldn’t have held back. If he had fought personally, Jiang Sxi’s group would not have lasted a moment.

“Unexpectedly fast!” Jin Yongsi sent out his origin power, flying into the sky to stand before Luo Tian.

“Nine Sources!” Seeing Luo Tian’s cultivation reached Nine Sources, Jin Yongsi was stunned, his face filled with shock.

“Surprised? I don’t understand why the Phoenix Sect couldn’t act due to a blood oath, but you—White Tiger Sect alone—why dare attack me!” Luo Tian had rushed night and day to Duan Shen Cliff. Upon sensing Jiang Sxi was safe, he relaxed slightly—but seeing the remaining Tianyuan Sect disciples barely surviving, his killing intent deepened.

“Just me! It seems Master Jin was right—you are truly a genius!” Golden light flared as the youth who had spoken to Jin Yongsi appeared before Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s brows furrowed. He didn’t know the youth’s background.

Yet, as the youth’s several figures rose into the air, clearly attendants or guards, Luo Tian realized this youth was no ordinary person. With the youth included, all were Eight Source Supreme Rank.

But when golden light flared, Nan Gong Yuqing—who had been standing behind Luo Tian unnoticed—turned grim. His blood Qi surged violently, his eyes turning crimson: “Divine Clan!”

Chapter 825: Divine Clan

“Divine Clan!” Hearing Nan Gong Yuqing’s words, Luo Tian felt a tremor. He gazed at the golden-light youth, surprised to meet a Divine Clan member in the Four Sacred Stars.

“Who are you?” The youth furrowed his brows, gazing at Nan Gong Yuqing’s blood Qi. He couldn’t recall such a person.

“Hmph, die!” Nan Gong Yuqing had no patience for words. His blood Qi surged, his long hair swirling like a demon’s aura. He brandished a crimson sword and lunged at the youth.

“Nine Sources! This youth is also Nine Sources!” Jin Yongsi’s face turned anxious. He had focused on Luo Tian, only noticing Nan Gong Yuqing now.

Jin Yongsi hadn’t expected this youth to be Nine Sources. From Nan Gong Yuqing’s aura, he sensed the youth was no match for Luo Tian.

The youth’s face also trembled. Seeing Nan Gong Yuqing approaching, he looked startled. Upon witnessing Nan Gong Yuqing’s movement, his face changed: “Tianmo Flash!”

“You’re a Demon Clan!” The youth roared, his mouth wide open. Before he finished speaking, blood Qi surged toward him.

The youth was no slouch; in an instant, he swung his golden sword and slashed at Nan Gong Yuqing.

Golden light flared, blood Qi filled the air. A powerful collision echoed between them, fire roaring into the sky.

In an instant, a golden streak flew backward from the blood mist. Blood mist formed a line of blood in people’s sight.

The golden light was impossibly fast, crashing into Duan Shen Cliff. Large fragments of stone fell from the cliff.

“Damn! How strong you are! Who are you, a Demon Clan servant? Daring to attack me!” The youth’s face was grim, blood spitting from his mouth. Yet his eyes burned with endless fury.

At the same time, the several Eight Source Supreme Rank attendants behind the youth had their faces tense. They hadn’t expected this young man to be so powerful. Their master’s strength was clear, but he couldn’t match this youth in one move.

“Disperse!” The attendants instantly scattered, surrounding the youth. Strange fluctuations emanated from their feet, forming a strong array. They watched Nan Gong Yuqing cautiously.

“Who am I? You’re not worthy to know!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s eyes were crimson. He flung his sword, a cruel smile on his face, and performed hand seals.

“Mogu Cangqiong!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s cold voice echoed. Nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine crimson swords instantly surrounded the Eight Source Supreme Rank attendants, forming a red barrier.

Nan Gong Yuqing didn’t give these Divine Clan members a chance to recover, directly invoking the Demon Realm’s Mind Control Technique.

The attendants lost their senses momentarily. This moment was enough for Nan Gong Yuqing!

His powerful soul returned to his body. He flicked his finger, and the crimson swords in the sky transformed into blood beams, flying toward the attendants within Mogu Cangqiong.

“Stop!” Jin Yongsi knew he had to act. If Nan Gong Yuqing continued attacking, the youth would die by his hand.

“Old dog, our score isn’t settled yet. You still have time to care about others!” As Jin Yongsi was about to move, Luo Tian’s mocking voice echoed in his mind. Luo Tian appeared before Jin Yongsi instantly, a spear in hand.

“Get out…” Jin Yongsi roared, drawing his silver spear. It transformed into a fierce white tiger, lunging at Luo Tian.

“Now you don’t have the right to speak to me like that. You should be the one leaving!” Luo Tian’s face showed no fear, his body transforming into a green storm as he attacked Jin Yongsi.

A powerful explosion echoed in the sky, causing people to tremble. The aura of a Nine Source Supreme Rank clash was enough to affect many.

Jiang Sxi stood on Duan Shen Cliff, a smile on her face. She had dared not act before due to fear of Jin Yongsi. Now, with Jin Yongsi and the Eight Source Supreme Rank attendants occupied, she was the strongest among them.

“Kill!” Jiang Sxi’s face turned cold. She returned to her ruthless, queen-like state, leading five thousand Tianyuan Sect disciples without fear toward the White Tiger Sect.

The battle erupted again at Duan Shen Cliff’s mid-slope. Countless blood Qi was absorbed by the cliff.

In the sky, Luo Tian and Jin Yongsi clashed. In an instant, Jin Yongsi was sent flying back, his face filled with shock.

One spear—between them, the difference was immediately clear. Jin Yongsi’s shoulder had a bleeding hole, and the destruction of his origin power combined with the spear’s tearing intent caused the wound to spread.

“Powerful! Luo Tian, who has reached Nine Sources, is so strong!” Jin Yongsi’s heart trembled. He hadn’t expected the difference between their Nine Source ranks to be so vast.

“What should I do?” Jin Yongsi’s heart was anxious, unsure how to proceed. He looked at the other battlefield, his mouth twitching.

Those Divine Clan members were even more pitiful. Countless crimson swords rained down on them, their bodies in disarray, blood staining their robes.

Jin Yongsi hadn’t feared Luo Tian’s arrival. With himself and the Divine Clan members, they could have subdued Luo Tian. But a third party—Nan Gong Yuqing—had ruined Jin Yongsi’s plan.

Jin Yongsi was stunned. Luo Tian didn’t give him any chance, stepping with the Seal-Breaking Step to appear before Jin Yongsi. He launched three punches—Misheng, Huiyun, Shashen—at Jin Yongsi.

Jin Yongsi’s face changed. He was struck by one punch, his body constantly retreating. Next came Luo Tian’s relentless attack, giving Jin Yongsi no chance to breathe.

“Great…” Luo Tian roared in his heart. For the first time since arriving at the Four Sacred Stars, he no longer feared the four great sects.

“Jin Yongsi, you forced me to act like a homeless dog. Did you ever imagine this day?”

“You’ve killed me multiple times without learning your lesson. Today, I’ll settle all my debts!” Luo Tian attacked while mocking.

Explosions echoed endlessly. Jin Yongsi could initially defend, but later he couldn’t withstand Luo Tian’s powerful attack. His body constantly emitted a dull sound.

“Peng…” Luo Tian extended his foot, kicking Jin Yongsi like a ball, sending him flying.

Jin Yongsi was severely wounded. Under Luo Tian’s full power kick, he collided with Duan Shen Cliff, sticking to the cliff wall. His mouth’s blood gushed like a fountain.

“Master was injured by Luo Tian!” White Tiger Sect disciples, fighting fiercely, saw Jin Yongsi’s severe injury. Their bodies trembled.

Jin Yongsi—one of the Four Great Sects’ leaders, a Nine Source Supreme Rank—today was injured by a boy. If this spread, Luo Tian’s name would surely echo across the Four Sacred Stars.

“Flee!” Jin Yongsi’s face was pale. His origin power quickly repaired his body, but he looked resolute. He knew if he didn’t flee now, he wouldn’t have a chance. Even burning his origin power, he wasn’t sure to escape—his injuries were too severe.

Having made a decision, Jin Yongsi immediately burned eight origin powers. His body instantly expanded. Veins on his surface seemed about to burst.

He slapped Duan Shen Cliff’s wall, and without hesitation, he transformed into a streak of light, flying away.

“Can’t stop him unless I burn my origin power too,” Luo Tian felt Jin Yongsi’s speed, mentally calculated. He sighed in regret. If Jin Yongsi delayed longer and his injuries worsened, he might have had a chance to catch him.

“Good for you—brave enough to burn eight origin powers!” Luo Tian’s eyes were cold. He didn’t care about Nan Gong Yuqing’s battlefield but focused on the White Tiger Sect disciples under Jiang Sxi, who had suffered heavy casualties.

He appeared before Jiang Sxi, sensing her life energy growing stronger. Luo Tian felt guilty and pulled her hand back.

“You’ve worked hard. I’ll take over from here!” His gentle voice eased Jiang Sxi’s face.

“Hmph…” Jiang Sxi softened, slowly stepping behind the Tianyuan Sect disciples. She no longer needed to act since Luo Tian was present.

“Surrenderers shall not be slain!” Luo Tian stood in the sky, his cold voice echoing into the ears of the remaining forty thousand White Tiger Sect disciples.

“Surrenderers shall not be slain!” The Tianyuan Sect disciples also roared, their voices piercing the clouds.

After the battle, the Tianyuan Sect’s numbers dropped by ten thousand to forty thousand. Though only forty thousand, they were strong and unshaken even against a million.

“Clang…” Without Jin Yongsi, the White Tiger Sect disciples were scattered. They had been terrified by Jiang Sxi’s group. As soon as Luo Tian’s words were spoken, disciples threw their weapons into the air and onto the ground.

Luo Tian smiled, watching each surrendering White Tiger Sect disciple. He sighed inwardly—Tianyuan Sect now had slaves.

“Uncle, save me!” Just as Luo Tian and others relaxed, a desperate voice echoed in their ears, as if trapped by seven or eight men.

Chapter 826: Transcendent Realm

At Duan Shen Cliff’s mid-slope, Nan Gong Yuqing was drenched in blood Qi. His eyes glowed red as countless crimson swords rained down on the Eight Source Divine Clan members.

“Pup! Pup!” Crimson swords pierced their bodies, causing them to scream.

The Divine Clan youth no longer had his previous arrogance. His face was terrified, gazing at Nan Gong Yuqing—a demon-like figure emerging from hell.

Too terrifying. The youth and his attendants now looked like porcupines, their bodies pierced by crimson swords. The swords continuously emitted a terrifying suction force, draining their blood Qi.

“Uncle save me!” Knowing Nan Gong Yuqing’s strength, the youth no longer wanted to fight him. He slapped his jade pendant and shouted.

Hearing the youth’s cry, Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing furrowed their brows, eyes filled with concern.

“Buzz…” The jade pendant shattered. In the cautious gaze of Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing, a middle-aged man emerged from the void.

The man resembled the youth. The most similar feature was his golden light, like a blazing sun, appearing before people.

Jiang Sxi also furrowed her brows, eyes filled with shock as she gazed at the middle-aged man emerging from the sky.

“Jiang Yi!” Jiang Sxi softly spoke a name, her eyes filled with deep concern. She stepped before Luo Tian.

A terrifying pressure immediately pressed on people’s bodies. The White Tiger Sect disciples who had surrendered and those from affiliated sects trembled slightly, a desire to kneel rising in their hearts. Some low-level disciples even began to bend slightly.

“You know them?” Luo Tian heard Jiang Sxi’s voice and looked at the youth with swords in his body and the middle-aged man emerging from the void.

“Hmph,” Jiang Sxi nodded slightly, her eyes filled with hatred but she said no more.

The middle-aged man stood like a king, scanning people before finally settling on Jiang Sxi.

“Unexpectedly, you’re here. Come with me to the Divine Clan for judgment,” he said.

“Hmph? You’ve gotten pregnant. That’s a disgrace to the Divine Clan bloodline. If you had obediently followed me back, maybe I would have spared your life. Now, you’ve desecrated the Divine Clan’s dignity by carrying a lowly race’s child. You’re seeking death yourself!” His face bore killing intent, finally focusing on Luo Tian.

“You too must die. Daring to desecrate our clan’s bloodline, not only will you die, but your family and friends will also join you in hell!” The middle-aged man naturally guessed Jiang Sxi’s relationship with Luo Tian.

“You talk about the Divine Clan, yet you’re卑劣. You think you’re superior to all? How disgusting! I’ve never seen such shameless people, and especially not so shameless!” Luo Tian’s face was filled with endless anger. The man’s words had touched his底线.

The middle-aged man, however, seemed to ignore Luo Tian’s words. He flicked his finger, and the swords on the youth and attendants flew off.

“You too, Demon Clan’s little rat. Do you know that attacking a Divine Clan member is a death penalty?” The middle-aged man spoke again, his voice carrying an overlord’s aura. His gaze was on Nan Gong Yuqing.

“Divine Clan? What are you? I’ve never seen such a lowly clan. You think you’re superior to all, but it’s just disgusting!” Blood Qi slowly gathered into a sword in Nan Gong Yuqing’s hand. Yet he didn’t continue attacking, knowing this middle-aged man was stronger than him and Luo Tian.

“Brave Demon Clan. I like you. Join me, and I’ll ensure your status in the Demon Clan rises again!” The middle-aged man didn’t anger at Nan Gong Yuqing’s words. His face wore a condescending expression.

“Get lost…” Nan Gong Yuqing couldn’t bear the middle-aged man’s haughty attitude. His body transformed into a streak of red light, his face filled with endless anger as he slashed.

“Indeed strong. Even a general Nine Source can’t match you. But before me, it’s useless!” The middle-aged man sneered, his eyebrows raised. He lightly pointed at Nan Gong Yuqing.

A golden light flared. A terrifying fluctuation rose. A golden sword materialized in the middle-aged man’s finger, colliding with Nan Gong Yuqing.

In an instant, Nan Gong Yuqing’s figure retreated rapidly. His disheveled hair appeared in Luo Tian and others’ sight.

“Single finger repelled Nan Gong Yuqing. Is this middle-aged man a Transcendent Realm?” Luo Tian’s eyes were serious, gazing at the overlord-like middle-aged man.

“Transcendent! I never expected Jiang Yi to reach Transcendent Realm in just a few decades!” Jiang Sxi softly spoke, her voice trembling. She gazed at Jiang Yi.

“Haha! Tremble, today you all die. My uncle entered Transcendent Realm thirty years ago. Do you know what Transcendent means? I can tell you, the Four Sacred Stars have no one in Transcendent. I’ll let you know—this is just my uncle’s fragment. If his true self came, what are you? If his true self had come earlier, you wouldn’t have survived that single finger!” The youth’s face was arrogant as he roared at Nan Gong Yuqing.

Luo Tian felt another tremor. He hadn’t sensed this middle-aged man was just a fragment.

“Transcendent Realm, so powerful!” Luo Tian muttered. He moved to Nan Gong Yuqing’s front, clearly seeing from their brief clash that Nan Gong Yuqing wasn’t the middle-aged man’s match.

“Silence!” Nan Gong Yuqing saw the youth’s arrogance and his eyes flashed cold. He brandished his sword again, its blade凝聚 sharply as he slashed at the youth.

“Uncle save me!” The youth clearly feared Nan Gong Yuqing. As soon as he attacked, the youth screamed like a startled monkey and hid behind Jiang Yi.

“Still foolish. Before me, you dare to kill!” Jiang Yi’s face flashed cold light. He slapped his hand, a storm rising instantly and scattering Nan Gong Yuqing’s blade.

At the same time, Jiang Yi’s feet produced strange fluctuations. His body vanished from the spot and appeared before Nan Gong Yuqing, his golden palm slapping out.

“Kill!” Luo Tian felt the power of Jiang Yi’s palm and his eyes turned serious. He stood before Nan Gong Yuqing, punching out. Nan Gong Yuqing also flashed cold light and slapped.

“Boom…” The collision of fists and palms sent a terrifying fluctuation to Duan Shen Cliff, causing people on the cliff to wobble.

Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing’s figures also appeared in people’s sight, battered.

Luo Tian was shocked. He had never encountered a Transcendent Realm powerhouse before. Now, he felt the power of Transcendent Realm—though it was just a fragment, it exceeded his ability to match.

Yet, Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing were confident. They believed they could escape Jiang Yi’s fragment calmly.

Jiang Yi seemed to know this, his face smiling: “Submit to me. This matter will be over. Otherwise, when my true self arrives, you’ll have no chance to submit!”

“Hmph, do you think you’ve got us?” Luo Tian replied, his voice carrying mockery.

“Haha! Are you on the wrong medication? Facing Transcendent Realm and still speaking like that! Transcendent Realm, do you think it’s something common?” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the youth and his subordinates laughed as if they heard a big joke.

“Transcendent Realm is impressive? I’ve never fought one. Today, I’ll fight one!” Luo Tian’s voice was cold, his body echoing with thunderous sounds.

Nan Gong Yuqing also had cold light in his eyes, his gaze deepening like Luo Tian’s.

In an instant, black energy flowed from their bodies, as if dark origin power. Yet it wasn’t quite dark origin.

“Demon Qi?” Jiang Yi saw the black energy from their bodies and spoke softly.

As a Divine Clan powerhouse, long acquainted with the Demon Clan, Jiang Yi naturally knew that demon Qi was unique to the Demon Clan. It was a method of transforming dark origin into a special form.

“Who are you? How can you cultivate demon Qi? You must hold a high position in the Demon Clan! I’ve seen all young generations of the Demon Clan. Why haven’t I met you two before?” Jiang Yi’s eyes showed confusion. He knew the Demon Clan’s depth, though it was currently weak, some people he couldn’t provoke. If he truly provoked the Demon Clan’s bloodshed, the Divine Clan would also suffer.

Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing didn’t answer Jiang Yi’s question. Their eyes flashed with light, black energy intensifying. Countless dark Qi enveloped Duan Shen Cliff, reaching the sky.

“Entering Demonry!” A low shout echoed from Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing, making people on the slope feel their minds chill.

Even the previously arrogant youth shivered involuntarily, his gaze turning fearful again.

“What secret technique is this? How can Nine Source Supreme Rank be enhanced again? Why didn’t I know about it!” Jiang Yi’s initially calm gaze finally stirred with a ripple, his voice low.

Chapter 827: Beating the Transcendent

At Duan Shen Cliff, demon Qi surged. Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing’s long hair fluttered as they bathed in the endless demon Qi, their faces showing a trance-like expression.

Everyone was shocked by the two men who looked like devils, trembling in fear.

“Entering Demonry!” They spoke in unison, as if two bottomless pits. Under people’s trembling gazes, they absorbed the endless demon Qi into their bodies.

At the same time, two swords formed from demon Qi appeared in their hands—realistic and solid. This gave them an eerie aura.

“Crack… Crack…” Two clear sounds echoed from their bodies, as if breaking some constraints. Their bodies radiated a terrifying fluctuation.

...
