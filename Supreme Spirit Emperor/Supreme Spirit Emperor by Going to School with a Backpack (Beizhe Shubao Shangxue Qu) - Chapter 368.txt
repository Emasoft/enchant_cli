“Manifestation of the Laws of Heaven and Earth!” The deep voice echoed through the shattered void, as if on the verge of collapse. Gu Tianyu finally unleashed his martial technique, a golden figure stepping forth from the void, revealing his condition at last.

His colossal form resembled an unyielding mountain, yet blood trickled from his lips, proving that the three Provisional Kings had wounded him. Yet none could discern how severe his injuries were.

“No use! Facing three at once, unless you are a true King, today shall be your bloodstained end!” A cold voice echoed again, as three overwhelming presences materialized before Gu Tianyu.

“Boom… Boom…” A grey mountain manifested from the hand of a Provisional King of the Hun Tian clan, shattering the void and pressing down upon Gu Tianyu.

The Provisional King of the Star Moon Divine Clan also altered his hands, one cradling a radiant moon, the other a blazing sun. As they merged, an oppressive aura surged forth, striking Gu Tianyu with devastating force.

“Buzz…” Golden feathers transformed into a dazzling storm beneath the stars, each strand resembling an ultimate sword, swiftly sweeping toward Gu Tianyu’s massive form.

The human race fell silent, their gazes fixed on the apocalyptic three martial arts techniques. Despair flickered in their eyes; each attack alone could annihilate an Epoch Peak, and together they would obliterate them all.

Gu Tianyu’s golden eyes bore deep concern as he formed seals, summoning a colossal golden cauldron. Nine Celestial Dragons coiled around it, charging toward the grey mountain with a thunderous impact.

Ignoring the collision of two techniques, Gu Tianyu took a step forward, his towering form launching golden fists toward the Star Moon Divine Clan’s Provisional King.

“Crack…” A powerful punch collided with the merged illusion of moon and sun, unleashing a violent storm across the stars.

“Ugh…” Golden feather waves surged over Gu Tianyu’s body, engulfing him in a torrent of overwhelming energy.

“Subdue!” After shattering the Star Moon Divine Clan’s attack, Gu Tianyu spat blood again. As his massive body retreated, he slammed both hands into the void.

Invisible waves rippled from his palms, enveloping the golden storm. In an instant, time seemed to freeze, and the golden storm exploded into waves of Epoch energy, surging over Gu Tianyu’s body.

Wounds tore across his form as blood dyed his massive frame, casting despair among the human race. Even Gu Tianyu, so formidable, had suffered grievous injuries against three equals.

Luotian clenched his fists tightly, worry etched across his face as he gazed at Gu Tianyu’s bloodied form. He pondered whether the final immortal energy within his dantian could slay a Provisional King.

Yet he soon shook his head, knowing the immortal energy, though formidable, might lack power against a Provisional King.

“I’ll assist Master Gu!” Zhong Zixuan’s gaze also bore concern, the might of the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans exceeding his expectations.

“I can too!” Luotian’s face flashed with cold determination, raising a hand to summon an unparalleled flesh body—Zhong Liantian’s perfected Reincarnation Body.

“Enter!” Luotian wished to prevent Gu Tianyu from enduring further, his grey soul drifting out toward Zhong Liantian’s body.

“Don’t!” Just as Luotian’s soul left his body, Gu Tianyu’s voice echoed in their ears.

Hearing this, Luotian furrowed his brows and returned to his body. Yet as his soul re-entered, his face paled instantly.

Chapter 1472: Provisional Kings Converge ()

“What’s wrong?” People looked at Luotian, puzzled by his sudden pallor.

“Curse!” A moment later, their faces lit with realization—Luotian had slain Ming Huan, and now his pain deepened.

Ming Huan, a son of the Ancient King, had cursed Luotian with unbearable agony. Combined with the curse from killing Ming Chen, even Luotian struggled to endure.

“Damn it!” Luotian cursed inwardly, his eyes flashing madness as a profound sense of crisis gripped him. Two grey flame dragons coiled around his soul, burning it relentlessly.

“Boom… Boom…” Luotian’s body surged with blood, his roar echoing as he pressed down against the two grey flames.

It was excruciating; even with his indomitable will, he could barely withstand it. He longed to pass out but remained unnaturally alert due to the unbearable pain.

“Ugh…” A mournful flute melody echoed as Zhong Zixuan played his jade flute, his face solemn as he softly played.

Invisible waves accompanied the beautiful melody, flowing into Luotian’s body. As they entered, the furious grey flames—like a wild beast—calmed upon meeting their master. The flames gradually stilled.

“Huff…” Luotian exhaled deeply, gratitude in his eyes as he glanced at Zhong Zixuan before his gaze flickered with intensity.

“Seal!” A tangible soul rose from Luotian’s body, materializing into a swirling aura. Waves surged again, rushing toward the grey flame marks.

With their combined efforts, the formidable curse was finally subdued, manifesting as two imprints on Luotian’s soul—two grotesque wounds that defied all attempts at healing.

“Never mind, for now it seems safe,” Luotian sighed internally. Regardless, he felt no immediate discomfort.

“But this is only a temporary suppression; if it erupts again, it will be even fiercer,” Zhong Zixuan said softly after the flute’s melody faded, his gaze on Luotian.

“Hm.” Luotian nodded, yet his concern for Gu Tianyu’s battlefield remained unchanged.

However, when Luotian gazed at the battlefield, his expression shifted dramatically, filled with intense shock.

Amidst the vast starry expanse, Gu Tianyu transformed into a thousand-zhang giant, radiating supreme power as he attacked the three Provisional Kings.

Though the three Provisional Kings were formidable, Gu Tianyu’s body bore numerous wounds. Yet each of his attacks left them in disarray.

“How could he be so strong!” The three Provisional Kings marveled, stunned that their combined might failed to subdue this human.

“Haha!” A deep laugh echoed as a figure cloaked in verdant lightning strode forth, his towering form rivaling Gu Tianyu’s. A savage aura radiated from him.

“Another Provisional King, of the蛮族 (Beast Clan)!” The crowd gasped, staring at the towering figure with a white wolf bone club on his shoulder.

“Boom… Boom…” The Beast Clan’s Provisional King hurled his club toward Old Sa Man, then leapt into the air, charging at Gu Tianyu.

“How many are there! The Ancient Ten Thousand Clans are truly terrifying!” The human race felt despair. Even Gu Tianyu, so extraordinary, faced four Provisional Kings alone—seemingly impossible.

Previously defeating three had stunned them; now with a fourth, it was an inevitable death trap.

“Kill!” The Beast Clan’s Provisional King charged without hesitation, his raw flesh alone exuding immense power. He struck Gu Tianyu with a punch that shattered the stars.

“Boom…” Gu Tianyu barely repelled three Provisional Kings’ attacks, then turned to clash with the Beast Clan’s.

The collision of two titanic forms echoed through the void, both retreating as the Beast Clan’s Provisional King bore a look of concern.

“Strong human! Again!” The Beast Clan’s Provisional King took another step, his body merging with the image of a divine beast. He descended upon Gu Tianyu like an ancient god—his ultimate technique, “Bamboo Seven Stomp.”

Gu Tianyu’s face paled, his body bleeding as he rose into the sky. His hands formed seals again.

“Boom… Boom…” Thunderous roars echoed through the void as a golden heavenly palace descended upon the other three Provisional Kings.

“Ancient Heaven Palace!” The crowd gasped, awestruck by the resplendent golden structure.

“Another technique conjured through supreme means!” All were stunned, gazing at the golden palace pressing down on the three Provisional Kings.

Though both radiated supreme power, Gu Tianyu’s was a mere illusion while the true Ancient Heaven Palace existed.

“Not enough!” Luotian soared through the air, his hands moving swiftly again. A radiant mirror emerged, emitting boundless light.

“Boom… Boom…” With the golden cauldron and mirror conjured earlier, three supreme artifacts pressed upon the three Provisional Kings.

“Buddha’s Attack!” Gu Tianyu ignored them, his eyes filled with confidence as he punched toward the Beast Clan’s Provisional King.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” Four resounding explosions echoed through the stars, leaving everyone in shock as the stars began to collapse, obscuring their view.

“Master Gu!” Luotian and others roared, anxiety in their eyes, unsure of Gu Tianyu’s condition.

“Roar…” The Ancient Ten Thousand Clans seemed ignited, their deafening roars echoing. To them, four Provisional Kings’ combined might would surely kill this human.

“How is it possible!” A peak of the Nine Abysses clan observed the grey energy, his face shifting.

As the waves calmed, a shocking scene emerged—Gu Tianyu stood bloodied and pale, breathing heavily as he gazed into the void.

Three figures spat blood, their bodies shattered and falling into the void—those who had first attacked Gu Tianyu.

On the other side, the newly arrived Beast Clan’s Provisional King fared no better; his massive body lay sprawled, his chest caved in.

“Invincible!” The nine regions erupted into cheers, gazing at Gu Tianyu standing proudly. Their eyes burned with madness.

“One man against four Provisional Kings—what monster is this human!” The Ancient Ten Thousand Clans trembled, staring at Gu Tianyu with disbelief.

“This is Gu Tianyu! The embodiment of invincibility. Throughout history, he was the most astonishing—young and terrifying, possessing the potential to ascend. The heavens suppressed him until he was drained, yet he rose again, living a second life worthy of an Epoch Lord!” Sun Shengtian and others, contemporaries of Gu Tianyu, gazed at him with reverence.

“You humans are indeed formidable, but if we four fight to the death, you shall surely perish here!” The four Provisional Kings recovered instantly, their eyes filled with awe—Gu Tianyu’s battle power was truly beyond comprehension.

The Ancient Ten Thousand Clans respected strength; Gu Tianyu’s supreme power today earned their respect.

“Want to kill me? You four shall lose three!” Gu Tianyu’s face bore coldness, his aura radiating confidence as he surveyed the four with a menacing gaze.

“Then add me!” Grey energy surged, a cold voice echoing as another overwhelming presence emerged in the lightning domain.

“Buzz…” The suspended Mortal Palace above the clans trembled, emitting a deep hum.

“A descendant of the Mortal Clan was slain?” A grey figure appeared, his presence sending a chill through all. Another Provisional King had arrived.

“How many Provisional Kings are there!” The human race trembled, their eyes wide with disbelief at the grey figure.

“Has the Mortal Clan’s Provisional King arrived?” Gu Tianyu spoke, coughing up blood and exhaling deeply.

“You humans have produced a remarkable strength, but you are inevitably declining!” The Mortal Clan’s Provisional King surveyed Gu Tianyu before speaking softly.

“Fight! Even if I stand alone, you shall not pass!” Gu Tianyu faced five Provisional Kings without fear, his voice resolute.

“Want to kill me? You shall lose three!” Before the Provisional Kings could speak, another voice echoed, startling them.

“Who gave you such confidence!” The Mortal Clan’s Provisional King sneered, his grey energy surging into a vast river. As he refined it, it transformed into a long grey snake, lunging at Gu Tianyu with fangs.

Chapter 1473: The Spine of Humanity ()

Faced with the Mortal Clan’s Provisional King’s attack, Gu Tianyu surged with indomitable spirit, his fist striking the grey illusion.

The other four Provisional Kings also attacked, their combined might an instant kill, surrounding Gu Tianyu’s massive form.

“Master Gu will not last long!” The human race trembled, some shedding tears as they watched Gu Tianyu’s colossal form clash with five Provisional Kings. Each collision saw him spew blood.

Gu Tianyu, an invincible powerhouse, stood as the spine of humanity, resisting five Provisional Kings’ overwhelming might.

Blood dyed the stars; though Gu Tianyu suffered repeated injuries, the five Provisional Kings too were wounded by him.

“How strong! Could it be because he lived a second life!” The five Provisional Kings marveled, stunned by Gu Tianyu’s seemingly invincible might. If this continued, he might indeed kill several of them as he claimed.

“Unite! Let us refine him!” The Mortal Clan’s Provisional King spoke, moving forward. His hands waved, sending waves of grey energy.

The others retreated, surrounding Gu Tianyu as their immense power surged forth.

“Boom… Boom…” Thunderous roars echoed, five annihilating auras intertwining above Gu Tianyu’s head. In an instant, they formed a vast net, enveloping him.

Divine light flickered across the net, its ultimate refining power entwining Gu Tianyu.

Gu Tianyu’s thousand-zhang form, under this ultimate refining power, seemed to descend—evidently trapped by their combined techniques.

“Roar…” Gu Tianyu roared to the heavens, his black hair flying as golden light flared. His blood surged, clashing against the five Provisional Kings.

“Let us wear him down! He cannot endure long!” The five exchanged glances, redoubling their efforts to maintain the net.

“I’ll help!” Luotian could no longer bear watching, knowing his current strength was crushed by a Provisional King. Yet with Zhong Liantian’s perfected Reincarnation Body, he was confident in aiding Gu Tianyu.

His grey soul drifted out again, this time ignoring Gu Tianyu’s warning and entering Zhong Liantian’s body.

“Boom… Boom…” A thunderous sound echoed within Zhong Liantian’s form, as if the great Daoist hymns had risen. The human race trembled.

“Again? Back then, Luotian used this body to withstand the Nine Saints of the Mortal Domain. Now he does it again, facing the Provisional Kings of the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans!” All faces shifted, their gazes on Zhong Liantian’s slowly opening eyes.

“Father!” Zhong Zixuan was momentarily dazed, then shook his head.

His blood surged, golden light radiating from Zhong Liantian’s body—pressure overwhelming the minds of all.

Back then, Luotian with half-Epoch strength had used this body to withstand an Epoch Peak. Now, with his full Epoch-level strength, the power was even more terrifying.

“This is a perfected Reincarnation Body—legend says once perfected, it can withstand an Epoch Lord!” The human race cheered, their faces filled with reverence toward Zhong Liantian.

Luotian slowly rose, clenching his fists before inhaling deeply. The stars trembled as a violent suction pulled at his true body.

“Buzz…” A pure white figure emerged from Luotian’s dantian, seated in meditation—his Reincarnation Immortality Body.

“One… two…” Five Reincarnation Immortality Bodies emerged from Luotian’s dantian, rushing into Zhong Liantian’s body.

“Boom…” Zhong Liantian’s previously exhausted dantian slowly revived, pure light filling it.

“Kill!” As Luotian surged forward toward Gu Tianyu’s direction, a long sword hummed. Zhong Zixuan smiled, his gaze filled with nostalgia as he flew after Luotian.

Both the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans and humans were captivated by their figures, eyes wide with shock.

“Who is this? Daring to join the Provisional Kings’ battle!” All gasped, even the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans’ peak elders bore disbelief. The Provisional Kings’ battle was perilous; even they dared not interfere, for one misstep meant death.

“That body is so strong!” A moment later, people marveled at Luotian’s control over Zhong Liantian’s body.

“That is the human race’s perfected Reincarnation Body!” Old Sa Man of the Beast Clan bore admiration, recalling their fierce battles at the Broken God Cliff.

“Terrifying! A single body possesses such might!” Fu Wenbin’s eyes narrowed, feeling he could not withstand a single strike from this supreme body.

As people marveled, Luotian and Zhong Zixuan, under immense pressure, arrived before Gu Tianyu’s body.

“Make way!” Luotian seized the net formed by the five Provisional Kings, his arms pulling fiercely.

“Arrogant!” The five Provisional Kings sneered, believing the perfected Reincarnation Body’s might was no match for their combined net. They were confident that none, save an Epoch Lord or a clan’s king, could break through.

“Crack…” Yet their eyes widened in disbelief as divine light flowed from Luotian’s hands, tearing a hole in the net.

“Buzz…” A long sword hummed, its brilliant blade slicing through the net, another hole vanishing from their sight.

“How is this possible!” They gasped, stunned by Luotian and Zhong Zixuan’s strength.

“Boom… Boom…” Gu Tianyu roared to the heavens, his golden body expanding again. The net shattered around him.

“Kill!” Luotian and Zhong Zixuan exchanged glances, then as if prearranged, they charged at the Beast Clan’s Provisional King.

They knew facing a single Provisional King was impossible, but together against the Beast Clan’s strong body, they might have a chance.

“Die!” The Beast Clan’s Provisional King glared at Luotian and Zhong Zixuan, fury in his eyes.

“Bamboo Seven Stomp!” He raised his foot, sending it crashing down upon them.

“Bamboo Seven Stomp!” Luotian roared, countering with his own Bamboo Seven Stomp.

“Sky-Devouring Nine Swords!” Zhong Zixuan wielded his golden sword, its radiant blade slicing through the heavens toward the Beast Clan’s Provisional King.

“Boom… Boom…” Thunderous roars echoed as two golden feet collided, sending Luotian and Zhong Zixuan flying backward. Blood spewed from their mouths instantly.

“Step… step… step…” The Beast Clan’s Provisional King bore a flicker of surprise, his massive body retreating. He was stunned by their strength, which had forced him to retreat.

“Buzz…” A golden blade sliced through the golden storm, appearing before the Beast Clan’s Provisional King. It struck his chest, leaving a deep wound before vanishing.

“Too strong!” Luotian and Zhong Zixuan exchanged glances, seeing each other’s shock.

One had entered the perfected Reincarnation Body, the other was a child of an Epoch Lord and a perfected Reincarnation Body—both peers of invincibility. They had even defied the heavens, fighting beyond their level. Yet now, against a Provisional King, they felt powerless. Without battling a Provisional King, one could not grasp their might.

“Again!” The Beast Clan’s Provisional King roared, unwilling to be wounded by Luotian and Zhong Zixuan. His golden foot descended again, crushing them.

Luotian watched Gu Tianyu battling four Provisional Kings, knowing he could not retreat. If he did, Gu Tianyu would face the same peril again.

“Bamboo Seven Stomp—Crush Stars!” Luotian, thinking, took his second and third steps.

Bamboo Seven Stomp was tailored for the Beast Clan’s strong bodies; Luotian, with his supreme body, unleashed a power even greater than before.

Two steps later, two golden feet collided with the Beast Clan’s Provisional King’s foot.

Zhong Zixuan, understanding he must fight desperately, wielded his golden sword and purple jade flute. They clashed violently.

“Crack…” Purple and golden lightning erupted from their clash, coalescing into a thunderous sword above Zhong Zixuan.

“Go…” Zhong Zixuan pointed, and the lightning sword instantly struck the Beast Clan’s Provisional King’s chest. It pierced him, blood splattering everywhere.

“Pf…” The Beast Clan’s Provisional King gaped in disbelief, roaring as a violent aura radiated from his body.

“Boom…” His roar shattered mountains and rivers, the lightning sword exploding within him, spreading thunder across his body.

“Boom…” Thunderous roars echoed again as Luotian and Zhong Zixuan returned to their positions, their bodies flying backward. Zhong Zixuan’s body cracked, sending shock through both.

Chapter 1474: Three Immortal Energies ()

“Unexpectedly, the human race still has such prodigies!” The Beast Clan’s Provisional King marveled, his body shaking as the lightning energy dissipated.

“Again!” Luotian and Zhong Zixuan roared, Luotian flying toward the Beast Clan’s Provisional King while Zhong Zixuan remained still, his hands brushing over the golden sword, staining it with divine blood.

“Body combat?” The Beast Clan’s Provisional King glared at Luotian charging toward him, his eyes ablaze with battle spirit. He took a step forward, swinging his fist to crush Luotian.

“Dao’s Seal of Demons!” Luotian, seeing the mountain-sized fist, flashed madness. White light formed patterns on his body, entering his indomitable flesh. He recited the Feathered Immortal Scripture, becoming a golden meteor as he charged toward the fist.

“Crack…” The disproportionate fists collided, producing a crisp sound that echoed through the void like thunder. It stunned the onlookers, leaving them in awe.

In an instant, Luotian’s golden body flew backward, and a grey soul drifted out of his body, filled with shock.

“Luotian’s soul has been expelled!” The human race recognized the grey soul instantly, realizing it was Luotian.

The Beast Clan’s Provisional King fared no better; his massive body flew backward, cracks spreading across it. His eyes bore disbelief.

“How could a human’s flesh combat wound a Beast Clan Provisional King!” The Ancient Ten Thousand Clans trembled, staring at the cracks on the Beast Clan’s Provisional King.

The Beast Clan’s flesh was known to all—no other clan could match it. Yet they could not fathom that a human had defeated one.

“Such a terrifying flesh body! If Luotian fully matures, no one could withstand it!” The human race cheered, envisioning Luotian’s future dominance.

“Sky-Devouring Nine Swords—One Sword Slashes the Void!” A deep voice echoed through the stars. In an instant, a blood-red sword light sliced through the void, annihilating everything before appearing above the Beast Clan’s Provisional King.

“Damn it!” The Beast Clan’s Provisional King glared, his body halting mid-flight. He roared, striking the ultimate sword with a punch.

A torrent of blood surged through the stars, like a mountain-sized arm falling, heavy with energy. It smashed through several lifeless planets before vanishing from sight.

Zhong Zixuan panted heavily, his face pale and body shriveled slightly—his previous strike had nearly cost him his life.

“With Epoch Peak strength, one sword severed a Beast Clan Provisional King’s arm! What attack is this!” The crowd had barely recovered from Luotian’s defeat of the Beast Clan’s Provisional King when Zhong Zixuan’s strike stunned them again.

“They are not human!” Diao Dezhu and others marveled, gazing at Zhong Liantian’s similar appearance and Zhong Zixuan’s weakened state.

“Indeed, their parents are titanic powers!” The crowd marveled; Zhong Zixuan was undeniably a prodigy.

“Ah, if I had titanic parents, I would be invincible too!” Diao Dezhu gazed at Zhong Zixuan with envy.

“Smack…” Diao Yuanshan slapped his own head, his gaze deep: “If I had a grandson like Luotian, I’d die laughing!”

“Underestimated you,” the Beast Clan’s Provisional King said, his arm regenerating. His eyes bore admiration—anyone would be impressed by such prodigies.

“But now, I must fight seriously!” The Beast Clan’s Provisional King’s gaze darkened. He felt his pride wounded, and his body absorbed waves of Beast Marks before launching another step toward Luotian and Zhong Zixuan.

“F***!” Luotian glared at the Beast Clan’s Provisional King, his eyes wild. He knew they were no longer at their peak; the previous attack had nearly cost them both their lives.

“Let me try!” Luotian’s eyes flashed with light. At this moment, his only hope was the immortal energy within his body—hoping it could harm a Provisional King.

“Rest, I’ll hold them for a while!” Luotian turned to Zhong Zixuan, pale-faced, and gazed at the Beast Clan’s Provisional King.

“Boom…” A thunderous sound echoed as a reincarnation immortal body infused with immortal energy exploded. A pure white light emerged in Luotian’s hands, instantly illuminating the stars. The overwhelming opportunity made the Beast Clan’s Provisional King wary.

“What is this?” All faces bore confusion, staring at the light in Luotian’s hands. Though it was but a thread, its overwhelming pressure made the Beast Clan’s Provisional King feel danger.

“Right! We still have immortal energy!” Diao Dezhu and Sun Kemin flashed with light.

“This is not of this world’s energy!” The Beast Clan’s Provisional King halted, his gaze heavy as he stared at the immortal energy in Luotian’s hands.

“Yet, even if it is strong, it may harm an Epoch Peak but still lacks power against me!” He spoke softly.

“Then add ours!” Purple light rose, appearing before Luotian—Diao Dezhu’s figure.

But when Diao Dezhu appeared beside Luotian, seeing the Beast Clan’s Provisional King’s massive form and overwhelming aura, he shrank back, his body trembling.

“…” Zheng Xin and others gazed at Diao Dezhu flying to Luotian’s side, speechless. They couldn’t believe Diao Dezhu had risked his life to show off, daring to face the Beast Clan’s Provisional King.

“Buzz…” Light flickered as Diao Dezhu waved his hand, conjuring the same energy as Luotian’s.

“I’m here too!” Sun Kemin, more composed than Diao Dezhu, appeared beside Luotian with a yang fish. He waved his hand as well.

“This bastard is also showing off!” Gu Lei and Zheng Xin were speechless, staring at Sun Kemin and Diao Dezhu flanking Luotian. They were utterly speechless.

“The spotlight is amazing!” Diao Dezhu’s face bore a triumphant grin, his eyes filled with pride as all gazed at them. He had forgotten that the being before him could crush him effortlessly.

“Buzz…” A moment later, a buzzing sound pulled Diao Dezhu and Sun Kemin back to reality. Their energies hummed, as if ready to break free at any moment.

The energy drew in Luotian’s hand, trembling as it rose with Diao Dezhu and Sun Kemin’s conjured energies.

“They must not succeed!” The Beast Clan’s Provisional King, seeing the three energies merging, felt a deep sense of crisis.

“Bamboo Seven Stomp—Shatter the Ages!” He took a step forward, his overwhelming aura sweeping across the stars. His golden foot rose slowly, then crashed down upon Luotian and others.

“F***! I’m not playing anymore!” Diao Dezhu and Sun Kemin were stunned by the golden foot, wanting to flee but finding their legs trembling, unable to move.

“Return!” Luotian, seeing them still there, felt anxious. Without hesitation, he kicked both of them, sending them flying into the human race’s formation like balls.

“F***! All for nothing!” Diao Dezhu fell, his eyes filled with regret.

“Buzz…” Luotian watched the three energies merge into one, a terrifying power surging from his hand.

As he pushed this energy forward against the apocalyptic golden foot, it exploded in power, sweeping across everything.

At the same time, the Beast Clan’s Provisional King’s Bamboo Seven Stomp appeared before Luotian, colliding with the terrifying energy.

“Boom…” Upon touching Luotian’s energy, the golden foot seemed to touch a taboo. In everyone’s shock, it shattered violently.

“How is this possible!” The clans trembled, watching the apocalyptic energy destroy the Beast Clan’s Provisional King’s seventh step.

The Beast Clan’s Provisional King also bore disbelief, stunned that his full-force seventh step was so easily defeated.

Yet soon, a wild look filled his eyes, as a powerful sense of crisis gripped him.

The power swept across, moving slowly yet instantly crushing the rules, appearing before the Beast Clan’s Provisional King at an incomprehensible speed.
