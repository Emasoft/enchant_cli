They also knew that individually, they were no match for Luo Tian; only by uniting could they surround and kill him.

“Th-this…” Seeing the small barrier formed by twenty or so people, Zhou Cang—who was still clashing with Ye Liangchen and others—alongside Jiang Xuan, suddenly halted their movements.

“This…! Ghostly aura!” Zhou Cang exclaimed in disbelief, his gaze filled with astonishment. He now sensed the difference in this situation.

Previously, he had received news that many were coming to trouble Luo Tian. They had suffered a major defeat at Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen’s hands, so they followed along as well. It was said that the Bountiful Heaven City Lord had tacitly approved of their mission to kill Luo Tian.

This news had filled Zhou Cang and his group with excitement, so they followed without hesitation. But now, Luo Tian had immediately unleashed a killing move, slaying more than one person.

This made Zhou Cang suspect, yet his heart was filled with exhilaration because killing meant Luo Tian had violated the military regulations. Thus, they could claim to be upholding the rules by killing Luo Tian.

But now seeing that black barrier, such techniques were clearly not something a celestial cultivator could wield. This realization dawned on Zhou Cang.

Likewise, those who had joined in the chaos also stopped their attacks. At first, they had merely wanted to swindle some battle merits or ghost-repelling pills from Luo Tian. But since the first person had been killed, they had second thoughts. They didn’t want to lose their lives over a few merits—such deaths would be too tragic.

“Roar…” From within the black barrier, dark ghostly entities coalesced, each radiating immense power as they howled toward Luo Tian.

“Ghost-Controlling Seal!” Luo Tian extended his hand, and a dark moon rose, exhaling waves of black mist. It surged instantly into the countless ghostly entities.

“Boom… boom…” Under the suppression of the Ghost-Controlling Seal, each ghostly entity disintegrated into swirling black mist within the barrier.

It was not that Luo Tian wished to subdue these entities; they were not naturally formed but created by Li Jianxing and others through techniques, making them uncontrollable.

Each ghostly entity was annihilated beneath the Ghost-Controlling Seal, and outside the barrier, Li Jianxing’s group wore solemn expressions. They felt the entities being destroyed within and grew anxious. Their concern was not merely that Luo Tian would obliterate these ghosts, but whether the squad leaders had arrived. If they did, they would be doomed.

Even a fool could see their methods bore resemblance to hell. In the celestial realm, aside from certain special sects, few used ghostly aura techniques.

The most frequent users of such methods were the Ghost King Sect among the Nine Celestial Mountains. The Ghost King Sect had originally defected from hell, and those who could wield ghostly aura were closely tied to the Ghost King Sect.

Yet these people had no connection to the Ghost King Sect at all; their identities were clearly suspicious.

As spies, they naturally possessed some life-saving techniques. At this moment, Li Jianxing carried a small-scale teleportation array on his person. Once activated, he could transport them out of Bountiful Heaven City and directly descend onto the battlefield, allowing them to charge into hell.

But Li Jianxing was reluctant; his identity had already been exposed, and he hadn’t yet killed Luo Tian. If he failed to kill him, they would face punishment upon returning to hell.

“Crack…” As Li Jianxing pondered, a crackling sound arose within the black barrier, snapping him back to reality.

“It seems they truly intend to abandon Luo Tian!” Li Jianxing’s eyes gleamed with intensity. After so long without the squad leaders arriving, it was clear Bountiful Heaven City truly wanted to eliminate Luo Tian.

“Then we have sufficient opportunity! After slaying Luo Tian, we’ll teleport immediately!” Li Jianxing made his decision swiftly.

The other spies, upon hearing Li Jianxing’s mental transmission, blinked in surprise and nodded. At this moment, their situation was perilous; only Li Jianxing’s teleportation array represented their last hope.

After exchanging glances, the group saw each other for the first time, their eyes filled with admiration. They hadn’t expected others to be spies as well.

“Don’t let him break free from the barrier!” Li Jianxing shouted, sensing Luo Tian’s relentless assaults within. He roared and unleashed another surge of power, his hands forming seals that etched into the black barrier.

Others did the same, each imprinting their seals onto the barrier. As Luo Tian’s attacks caused cracks, they rapidly mended.

“Roar…” As Li Jianxing and the others completed their seals, the ghostly aura within the barrier surged again. This time, instead of thousands upon thousands of ghosts, it coalesced into a colossal entity.

“Enhanced again?” Luo Tian stood within the barrier, extending his hand to produce a token. He mentally conveyed to Ye Liangchen and others not to act.

At the same time, the colossal entity formed—its body towering over ten zhang high, a scorpion-like head with two arms radiating dark light, as if capable of crushing all. Its lower body resembled a snake, coiled and writhing, its black scales exuding an icy chill.

“What is this ghostly creature?” Luo Tian’s eyes held confusion. Even with his mastery of the Classic of Mountains and Seas, he could not identify this being.

Yet a sense of alarm filled his mind, making him regard the entity with solemnity.

“Sss…” A piercing sound echoed as the void trembled. The twin black scythe-like arms of the entity lunged toward Luo Tian, appearing before him in an instant.

“Boom…” Luo Tian planted his foot, vanishing from view. The two dark arms collided with him, causing the void to tremble. Luo Tian’s previous position twisted.

“His speed is fast! And he has shattered the void—his power has surpassed that of a true immortal!” Luo Tian assessed the entity’s strength, then unleashed the Ghost-Controlling Seal with a mighty strike.

“Crack…” The black Ghost-Controlling Seal, imbued with the unique suppression aura over ghosts, smashed onto the scorpion’s head. A crisp sound echoed thunderously within the barrier.

“We won’t let him escape!” Li Jianxing and his group roared, their spiritual energy and true immortal power flowing freely into the barrier, merging into the entity’s body.

“Hum…” A red glow flickered; the entity’s eyes suddenly glowed with intense red light. Its two arms, radiating cold芒, lifted again. Simultaneously, its thick snake-like tail lashed toward the open sky, sealing all of Luo Tian’s escape routes.

“I’ll see if your scorpion arms are stronger than my fists!” Luo Tian, seeing no escape, sneered. He planted his foot and charged toward the scorpion’s arms.

Chapter 2035: The Battle, Luo Tian's Progress

Luo Tian instantly appeared before the scorpion, his golden fist carrying twice his physical strength, striking the massive scythe.

The collision echoed within the barrier. As Luo Tian’s fist met the scythe, the faces of Li Jianxing and his group turned pale.

“Expel…” The black aura shattered, the scorpion howled in pain, its roar echoing. In that moment, another scythe and the thick snake tail also surged toward Luo Tian, sweeping him.

“Get out of my way!” Luo Tian sneered, his hands suddenly extending. Two golden hands grasped the scythe and the snake tail.

“Boom… boom…” Two resounding sounds echoed, the collision causing Luo Tian’s body to tremble slightly. Blood spurted from his mouth.

A barrier formed by nearly ten half-true immortals and ten true immortals was not easily broken.

Luo Tian, though confident, knew that if twenty people did not unite, he could kill them with some cost. But once united, the scorpion’s strength had approached that of a true immortal in the middle stage.

“Squeak…” As if locked in a stalemate, both hands gripped the scythe and tail, emitting continuous sounds.

Luo Tian exerted his strength, pouring spiritual energy into both hands to maintain their grip without being shattered.

Outside the barrier, Li Jianxing’s group wore expressions of joy. This stalemate was extremely beneficial for them.

Luo Tian was alone; how could his spiritual energy match that of twenty people? Though their consumption from the “Ten Thousand Ghosts Devouring Immortals” barrier was significant.

Gradually, Luo Tian noticed the issue. Moreover, the scythe he had previously shattered was slowly coalescing again. If fully restored, that would be Luo Tian’s most dangerous moment!

“Dharma Body!” Luo Tian roared, and with a thunderous sound, his body began to rapidly expand. A explosive power radiated from his form.

“Heaven and Earth!” His massive body stood within the barrier, surrounded by intricate divine patterns. A powerful aura radiated from his form, leaving everyone in awe.

“Go…” As he expanded, Luo Tian’s body was several times larger than the scorpion. He released his grip on the snake tail and clapped both hands together, striking the other scorpion arm with all his might.

The thunderous sound echoed, an invisible wave spreading outward and colliding with the black barrier. Li Jianxing’s group turned pale again, their blood pressure shaking.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian shattered the other scorpion arm, the black snake tail lashed through space, striking Luo Tian’s thigh after his “Dharma Body Heaven and Earth” technique. A dull sound echoed from Luo Tian’s body.

Step by step…

Luo Tian’s massive form took steps, the lashing causing him to spit blood. His enormous body collided with the black barrier, shaking the military camp courtyard.

“What kind of power is this? It surpasses true immortal initial stage!” People murmured, sensing the terrifying aura from within the barrier.

Though Luo Tian was wounded, the scorpion had also lost two arms and now only one tail remained.

“Hum…” Though it was just a single tail, it still radiated immense power. Under Li Jianxing’s group’s control, it lashed toward Luo Tian again. Meanwhile, the two arms rapidly regrew.

“Wear him down until he dies!” Li Jianxing’s face bore coldness, sensing Luo Tian’s injuries.

“Die!” Luo Tian leapt into the air again, his body wrapped in divine patterns. He delivered a mighty kick—“The Seven Steps of the蛮.”

At the same time, the ghostly entity’s two scythes coalesced instantly, slicing toward Luo Tian. The scorpion opened its mouth and spat, causing the world to tremble as it transformed into a ghostly face, swallowing Luo Tian.

“Roar…” A dragon’s roar echoed as Luo Tian’s foot stomped onto the black snake tail. At the same time, a thunderous dragon roar echoed across heaven and earth. A golden long dragon surged from Luo Tian’s hand, its head clearly being one of his hands!

The Heaven Dragon Unseen Form Technique!

This palm was the manifestation of the Heaven Dragon Unseen Form Technique, its aura overwhelming. Meanwhile, Luo Tian’s other hand struck with a punch that pierced the void.

The collision resounded violently. This time, the snake tail and both arms were shattered by Luo Tian, leaving only a dark ghostly face that suppressed Luo Tian’s massive body. The earth trembled beneath him.

“Spit…” At the same time, Li Jianxing’s group also spat blood, their eyes filled with intense disbelief. They hadn’t expected that even after uniting, they still couldn’t subdue Luo Tian.

“End!” Luo Tian’s face was pale as his massive body soared into the sky, rushing toward the black barrier before the scorpion could recover.

This time, it wasn’t just shaking but directly shattering the black barrier.

“Crack…” Thunder roared as lightning surged around Luo Tian, instantly shattering the black barrier.

“Damn it!” Seeing Luo Tian break free from the barrier, Li Jianxing’s group wore expressions of horror. Their spiritual energy and true immortal power had been mainly focused on the scorpion, neglecting the barrier’s maintenance. Luo Tian had exploited this gap.

“Out! He actually broke through a barrier formed by twenty strong individuals!” As Luo Tian burst out, the eighth squad’s people were in a uproar.

“Unmatched! My Tian!” Ye Liangchen’s eyes gleamed with excitement.

As the barrier shattered, the black scorpion no longer coalesced; only Li Jianxing’s group stood pale-faced.

“Boom… boom…” The towering body reached the heavens, suddenly extending a fist like a falling star. It struck downward toward those on the ground.

“Boom… boom…” With twice his physical strength and the加持 of the Divine Beast War Song and Dharma Body Heaven and Earth, this punch was Luo Tian’s peak strike—capable of annihilating a true immortal initial stage.

The earth trembled, stones flew everywhere. The thunderous impact killed three half-true immortals instantly.

Luo Tian was not satisfied with killing three half-true immortals, as ten true immortal initial stage individuals also launched martial techniques toward him.

Boom… boom…

Each technique struck Luo Tian’s massive body, the dust swirling and enveloping his form.

“Again!” Li Jianxing roared. He knew Luo Tian would not die; after all, the scorpion hadn’t killed him within the barrier.

Their attacks were strong but could only wound Luo Tian, and he sensed Luo Tian’s body was unusually abnormal.

Without Li Jianxing speaking, eighteen people raised their hands again, forming another set of techniques. Before the dust settled, they launched them again.

One… two…

Seven rounds of attacks, each stronger than the last. People were stunned; two youths with bloodied masks tightly gripped their fists but did not step forward.

Everyone held their breath, eyes fixed on the swirling dust. The entire courtyard of a thousand zhang was reduced to flat ground, even with the barrier present, it had been battered beyond recognition.

Li Jianxing’s group panted heavily; their spiritual energy was drained. If Luo Tian still didn’t die, they would have to retreat.

The heavens collapsed, winds reversed. After a quarter of an hour, the terrifying storm finally calmed. A figure stood there, his body radiating divine laws, a smile on his face as he panted heavily. He gazed at Li Jianxing’s group, whose faces were pale.

“Not dead! How is this possible!” Almost everyone spoke at once, staring at Luo Tian. They couldn’t believe that such attacks could leave a true immortal middle stage wounded but unable to kill a half-true immortal.

“Hundred Refinements Body Cultivation, Intermediate!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with intensity. Since entering the half-true immortal stage, his martial arts and techniques had naturally advanced—such as the Nourishing Soul Scripture, Heaven Dragon Unseen Form Technique, and Hundred Refinements Body Cultivation.

With the battle just now, his theory was fully validated; each strike had unleashed Luo Tian’s physical potential, making his body even stronger. In short, Luo Tian’s current body was comparable to a true immortal middle stage.

“Boom… boom…” Luo Tian moved swiftly, vanishing from the spot and appearing before a true immortal initial stage opponent. His body collided with the opponent’s, causing a crackling sound.

The sound of destruction echoed immediately, leaving everyone gasping in awe. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so变态, directly crushing a true immortal initial stage with his body.

The scene Luo Tian created was too shocking. On one hand, it was due to his body’s significant enhancement; on the other, the true immortal initial stage opponent had already consumed too much spiritual energy maintaining the barrier. He hadn’t reacted in time, and thus was crushed by Luo Tian.

“Go!” Li Jianxing saw this Luo Tian and completely lost the will to kill him. He knew it was no longer about them killing Luo Tian, but whether Luo Tian would kill them.

Li Jianxing extended his hand, a black array plate appearing before him. It expanded with a thunderous sound, engulfing Li Jianxing’s group in dark light.

“Finished showing off? You think you can leave?” Luo Tian sneered, his hands forming seals. A series of talismans flew from his hands, spreading instantly. A high-level martial technique erupted with overwhelming waves.

The heavens continuously cracked, gray mist emanating from the void, causing Li Jianxing’s group to turn pale.

“Void Shattering, it disrupted the teleportation!” Li Jianxing’s group looked even more distressed.

Chapter 2036: Why Me Again?

With a thunderous sound, Luo Tian soared into the air and appeared beside Li Jianxing. He now knew that among these remaining people, Li Jianxing was a minor leader.

“Get out of my way!” Li Jianxing shouted, a life-or-death crisis instantly spreading through his mind. He became completely frenzied.

Though Li Jianxing was a half-true immortal, he naturally possessed some life-saving techniques. Seeing Luo Tian approaching him, Li Jianxing immediately acted. He waved his hand, and a white candle appeared in his grasp. He spat out blood.

This blood was not red but an eerie black. When it touched the white candle, it instantly ignited the candle with dark flames that flickered in people’s sight.

The small flame trembled, yet it caused Luo Tian to immediately retreat, his face showing solemnity. He felt a powerful danger within the flames.

At this moment, Li Jianxing looked like a withered corpse; his eyes were sunken, and his vitality had significantly diminished. His entire body looked like a dry corpse, but his eyes still held movement, indicating he was alive.

“Hum…” The flame flickered, emitting a scorching heat that caused the heavens to collapse. A trembling aura radiated from the dark flames.

“This is a corpse candle refined by an immortal king!” Someone recognized what the white candle was, their face filled with shock.

“Hear it said that in hell, there is a special method to refine living people into corpse candles. An immortal king initial stage could refine eighteen corpse candles. Once lit, the ghostly fire would be equivalent to one strike from an immortal king. If all eighteen corpse candles were lit, it could even awaken the soul of that immortal king to fight for them!” People’s faces were filled with awe as they listened to the explanation of the person who knew about this candle.

“Immortal King’s Strike!” In the hall, Ke Duanshan and Jiang Chen’s faces also showed shock. Their eyes gleamed with intensity.

“If he can withstand it, this trial is complete!” Zhu Ge Hong smiled, looking at Luo Tian to see how he would withstand it.

Others also showed interest, wanting to see what method Luo Tian would use to resist a ghostly fire equivalent to an immortal king’s strike.

“Everyone prepare!” Ye Liangchen shouted, his voice filled with solemnity. His entire body’s aura had changed drastically. He formed seals with both hands, emitting terrifying waves from his grasp.

“No need!” Luo Tian mentally conveyed to Ye Liangchen. Ye Liangchen had feigned being a spoiled brat for so long; if he exposed himself now, it would be quite regrettable.

“Hum…” The next moment, the dark flame flew from the corpse candle toward Luo Tian, giving him a sense of inevitability, as if he were sinking into mud.

“Qixi!” Luo Tian pressed his hand to his forehead, and a seven-color flame flew from his forehead, forming a small figure.

“Delicious!” Qixi appeared before Luo Tian, seeing the approaching dark flame. His face showed intense greed, drooling.

However, Qixi’s body trembled slightly, clearly sensing the terrifying nature of the dark flame.

“Human Flame!” Seeing Qixi’s form, people around were stunned. Luo Tian had previously unleashed the seven-color fire sea on the battlefield, which was astonishing. They hadn’t expected that this seven-color fire sea was actually a human flame.

“Qixi, eat it! Father will help you hold him back; hurry up and eat!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed cruelty, a self-cruelty. He wanted to help Qixi grow and evolve!

At the moment Qixi appeared, the dark flame trembled slightly, instinctively sensing fear.

“Good!” Qixi opened his mouth and spat out a seven-color fire lotus, which flew toward the dark ghostly flame. Instantly, it transformed into a vast fire sea, enveloping the dark flame. A shocking refining power filled the world.

“Hum…” Sensing Qixi’s overwhelming fire, the dark flame’s aura surged again. It also emitted a greedy emotion—wanting to devour Qixi.

A crackling sound arose from Li Jianxing’s hand, the corpse candle suddenly cracked and turned into gray mist, flying out of his grasp. In the chaos, a shadow could be seen—a fragment of a soul, a remnant soul of an immortal king. It was merely a fragment with its will erased and sealed within the corpse candle.

At this moment, Qixi’s appearance had awakened the fragment of the immortal king’s will to live. It escaped from the corpse candle.

Qixi could devour it and become stronger, but if it devoured Qixi, it could revive itself in another form.

Luo Tian took out the “Pen of Heaven’s Destruction,” a terrifying aura rising into the sky. He waved his hand, carving a golden “soldier” character, which suppressed the tiny black flame.

“Lin, Dou, Zhe, Du, Zhen…” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate and recited six big characters from his hands. They spread in six directions, surrounding Qixi’s fire and the dark flame, forming a six-character barrier. This made Qixi’s fire even more overwhelming, emitting an earth-shattering wave that pushed back the dark flame slightly.

“It’s the “Six-Character Sealing Art” of the calligraphy and painting immortal! He has already mastered six forms, and he combined them into an enhancement array, making the human flame even stronger!” Jiang Chen and others nodded.

If Luo Tian’s current strength faced an attack equivalent to that of an immortal king, he would definitely die. Even with a top-tier divine artifact, it couldn’t withstand it.

But Qixi’s presence gave Luo Tian a chance against this ghostly fire. After all, Qixi had a special resistance to fire. This ghostly fire was strong but also under Qixi’s control. Plus, with the six-character mantra barrier from Luo Tian, Qixi had a chance to devour this ghostly fire.

“However, that fragment of soul is quite troublesome. If it merges with the ghostly fire, it will still suppress this human flame!” Guan Yong spoke softly, his gaze on the soul that had emerged.

“Soul?”

Luo Tian’s face showed a slight smile, which left everyone puzzled. They didn’t understand how Luo Tian could still smile at this point.

“An immortal king’s soul fragment—I’ve never seen one before!” Luo Tian extended his hand, and an invisible wave spread from it. The soul fragment, already outside the barrier, suddenly paused, emitting a thunderous roar and trembling violently. It then uncontrollably flew toward Luo Tian’s direction.

“What happened? An immortal king soul fragment, yet it is controlled by Luo Tian!”

“Not possible! That’s an immortal king soul fragment, though just a fragment. It shouldn’t be controlled by Luo Tian!” Everyone was shocked, watching the immortal king soul fragment now in Luo Tian’s hand.

“This soul!” Luo Tian grabbed the soul fragment, and upon contact, a familiar feeling arose in his heart. He quickly took it into his possession.

On the other hand, Qixi’s face was pale but his belly grew increasingly full. His eyes showed joy, and his body emitted a crackling sound.

Time passed slowly. After an hour, within the six-character barrier, the two flames collided and eventually determined a winner. Qixi’s head gradually sprouted an eighth color, a small whip.

Within the barrier, eight-color fire seas appeared, and Qixi swallowed them into his body. He yawned, and his body grew a few inches taller.

“Indeed!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with intense joy, sensing Qixi’s strength.

“If I am a true immortal, then Qixi’s fire would threaten a true immortal. If I am an immortal king, then Qixi’s fire would threaten an immortal king!” Luo Tian muttered, sensing Qixi’s transformation.

“End!” Luo Tian smiled, retrieving Qixi. Qixi needed time to digest, so for a while, Luo Tian couldn’t use Qixi.

“Kill!” Luo Tian moved again, rushing toward Li Jianxing’s group with his immense physical strength.

Another thunderous sound echoed. Within a quarter of an hour, except for Li Jianxing and two true immortal initial stage men, the others were all completely killed by Luo Tian.

“Good, good! He left a live one!” Jiang Chen’s group wore satisfied expressions as they stood up.

“Duanshan, bring this kid over later!” Jiang Chen addressed Ke Duanshan, having made a decision.

“Yes!” Ke Duanshan stood up, his face serious as he stepped out of the hall.

“Yeliangchen, capture these three!” Luo Tian addressed Ye Liangchen, then looked at Zhou Cang’s group with coldness.

“You really have no shame! Daring to provoke me!” Luo Tian sneered, looking at Zhou Cang. Then he planted his foot and rushed toward Zhou Cang’s group.

“What do you mean, Luo Tian!” Seeing Luo Tian rushing over, Zhou Cang’s group turned pale.

Although Luo Tian was severely wounded now, his terrifying physical strength made them tremble. Moreover, he had just killed over two hundred people—those were all hell’s spies!

If Luo Tian killed them, and if he said they were spies, they would die even more painfully than those before. They weren’t spies!

“Boom…” With a thunderous sound, Luo Tian’s fist struck Zhou Cang’s face. Zhou Cang’s body flew backward, his teeth all shattered, and his head felt heavy.

“Why, again me!” Zhou Cang’s heart cried out. Last time, Luo Tian had also struck him first.

Chapter 2038: The Ultimate True Immortal Soul

Within the eighth squad leader’s hall, Ke Duanshan stood there, gazing at Luo Tian. The atmosphere was tense; the two stood in silence without speaking to each other.

“I didn’t participate much in this,” Ke Duanshan spoke softly, breaking the silence. He looked at Luo Tian’s silence and felt he couldn’t read him.

“Hm.” Luo Tian nodded, believing Ke Duanshan’s words. In their eyes, he was nothing and wouldn’t deceive him.

“Is a company commander more important than me?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed waves, but he didn’t speak. Then he turned and left the hall.

“Three months?”

“I never expected that the life of the blood-faced man would be connected to me!” Luo Tian walked through the military camp, a slight smile on his face.

“First collect some interest; later, I’ll take over a thousand-commander!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed a smile. He thought of the blood-faced man, and his hatred for him had never ceased.

Though Luo Tian couldn’t fight the blood-faced man now, he might have a chance against his thousand-commander.

“Tian!” Luo Tian thought as he returned to his residence, seeing Ye Liangchen and others standing there. Their eyes were filled with excitement, having gained much from Zhou Cang’s group.

“Company commander!” Huo Zhen and Zhang Desheng also stood respectfully, their faces filled with admiration. Even true immortal initial stage masters revered Luo Tian genuinely.

Plus, the merits they had exchanged and the items taken from those people made them confident in their cultivation.

“Alright, go do your things! Three months later, I’ll be out for a while. You must protect Yeliangchen!” Luo Tian smiled lightly, not telling Huo Zhen about the matter.

“Yes!” Everyone left quickly, eager to improve their strength and not linger long.

“Tian, what happened?” Ye Liangchen remained behind, his eyes filled with solemnity as he addressed Luo Tian. He could sense a change in Luo Tian’s mindset.

“Nothing, just a secret mission!” Luo Tian smiled lightly and didn’t tell Ye Liangchen. If he did, knowing Ye Liangchen’s nature, it would either cause a big mess or have him accompany.

“Okay.” Ye Liangchen furrowed his brows but didn’t press further, then walked to his residence.

In the following days, Luo Tian’s name spread throughout Bountiful Heaven City. It wasn’t just about the previous ghost-repelling pills; this time, it was real combat power. One person killing two hundred spies—Luo Tian’s strength had exceeded people’s imagination.

“Too terrifying! He’s still just a half-true immortal, yet he kills true immortal initial stage as if killing an ordinary person!” People murmured.

“He is a company commander, but even more terrifying are his subordinates. With one hundred people’s strength, they held off hundreds of people. If it weren’t for those people stopping them, Luo Tian wouldn’t have killed two hundred!” People then realized something—that Luo Tian’s subordinates were also incredibly strong, yet they had been overshadowed by him.

Time passed slowly; the military camp gradually calmed down, and Luo Tian’s story faded away. Huo Zhen and others’ strength had significantly improved; almost everyone climbed a small step.

Luo Tian’s strength had also increased greatly these days, nearly at the final stage before true immortality. The golden-black divine pills had nine cracks, as if ready to break at any moment.

Yet Luo Tian hadn’t taken that final step because he had been hesitating, wondering whether to attempt true immortality.

Because recently, Qin He Feng and Ye Chen had entered the true immortal initial stage, their strength enhanced significantly. If Luo Tian didn’t enter the true immortal initial stage, he might fall too far behind.

In a quiet courtyard, Luo Tian stood in his room, his face filled with hesitation. He waved his hand, and a gray aura hovered before him. A powerful aura radiated from the gray soul.

This gray soul was the reward given by Jiang Chen to Luo Tian for searching for the mother of the Lotus of the Afterlife. He had converted all other rewards into strength, leaving only this gray soul.

“Collect three complete ultimate true immortal souls, refine and absorb them into your body to become an ultimate true immortal!” Luo Tian muttered, his eyes filled with hesitation.

The soul in his hand was the ultimate true immortal soul—this was why he hesitated. If there were no such souls, he might become a regular true immortal. But now that he had one, his thoughts became active.

“Another two and I could become an ultimate true immortal! But where would I find so many ultimate true immortal souls? If only I had kept Guan Hongsheng’s soul!” Luo Tian muttered to himself.

“Wait a little longer, until I infiltrate hell. If I still can’t find an ultimate true immortal soul, then I’ll become a regular true immortal!”

“Even if I am a regular true immortal, I can still subdue Qin He Feng and Ye Chen!” Luo Tian’s face showed confidence. Then he closed his eyes to cultivate.

As time passed, the entire military camp gradually improved its strength. Others, even Ye Liangchen, entered the true immortal initial stage when Luo Tian’s mission had one month left.

People were curious why, despite being a half-true immortal before, Luo Tian was so strong. But now that everyone had entered the true immortal stage, he remained a half-true immortal.

“Only one month left!” Luo Tian’s eyes were deep as he stepped out of the courtyard, with Huo Zhen and others behind him.

“Is that Luo Tian? He hasn’t come out for nearly two months. Why is he coming out today?” People saw Luo Tian stepping out and were puzzled.

“Is he trying to leave the city for a trial, entering true immortality?” People were puzzled, watching Luo Tian head toward the inner courtyard.

Luo Tian’s appearance caused a stir but didn’t draw much attention.

“Luo Tian, wants to challenge the thousand-commander, Lei Ming!” But soon after, a loud voice echoed in people’s ears, causing everyone to startle.

“Lei Ming, the younger brother of the blood-faced thousand-commander!” People were stunned. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to stir up another big event after two months.

“Lei Ming, the thousand-commander now is a true immortal middle stage. His five-color spiritual lightning has refined his body, making him the best among thousand-commanders. Though Luo Tian is strong, he’s still just a half-true immortal. Even if his body can defeat true immortal initial stage, defeating Lei Ming thousand-commander is impossible!” People murmured, watching Luo Tian standing outside a luxurious courtyard.

“This kid wants to take revenge!” The blood-faced man’s eyes showed a slight smile, then he extended his hand. A gray soul flew from his grasp.
