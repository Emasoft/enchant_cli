“Another lightning strike? Have I been cursed these past few years?” Luo Tian calculated the days, letting out a long sigh. He dared not be careless, his gaze cautious as he stared at the sixtieth layer of the sky. A terrifying pressure descended upon him, causing his lips to twitch. Dense clouds rapidly accumulated, heavy pressure making Luo Tian’s face change color. This lightning tribulation felt different from before.

Nine thunder dragons roared within the dark clouds. Luo Tian immediately began to vigorously recite the Mind Demon Scripture, preparing to withstand the heavenly thunder.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian just started, the heavens roared. The black clouds sank further, and even more terrifying was that the nine thunder dragons instantly spread out, beginning to split apart.

“Hey kid, I didn’t expect you to face lightning again. I’ll see if you can make it through the next level. This is truly fate’s blessing!” The artifact spirit laughed, eyes filled with excitement. This was all the artifact spirit's doing.

“Damn it, it’s you again!” Luo Tian cursed under his breath, his mind trembling. At that moment, the clouds above were already brimming with lightning energy, an overwhelming atmosphere of destruction making Luo Tian’s mind tremble. The thunder in the clouds was countless, leaving Luo Tian speechless. Not only could his elixir field not withstand it, but even his physical body might not endure.

“What should I do?” Luo Tian’s mind raced as he thought of a plan. But the thunder above gave him no time to think. Crack! A blue lightning bolt descended from the sky, striking Luo Tian.

This was just the beginning. Terrifying bolts of lightning poured down like rain, instantly transforming the sixtieth layer’s space into a sea of thunder.

“Don’t play like this!” Luo Tian cursed, his body darting toward the exit of the sixtieth layer. At this moment, he could only think of escaping to see what lay beyond.

“Boom! Boom! Boom…”

As Luo Tian dashed forward, the lightning struck the ground of the sixtieth layer, causing it to tremble.

Luo Tian stepped on the Yellow River Step, dodging left and right. Though he tried his best to evade, he still got struck by the lightning tribulations. In a moment, over twenty bolts capable of killing an advanced immortal were struck upon Luo Tian’s body, instantly leaving him in disarray.

“Ah…” Electricity surged through his body, entering his elixir field. Luo Tian let out a painful roar, but he seemed unaffected, moving at incredible speed toward the exit.

What used to take only a few breaths to escape now took Luo Tian half a bell. Worse still, the lightning that struck the ground did not fully dissipate but instead regenerated immense power, sweeping toward Luo Tian again.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed bitterness. He was racing against the lightning; if he were struck by those reappearing bolts, he would surely lose half his life.

“Hum…” Luo Tian’s speed was still fast. After withstanding three tribulations, he rushed into the sixty-first layer.

“Dare to challenge me? Although I can’t let you escape, I can still enhance the original power. You’ve already entered the sixty-first layer—there’s more fun ahead!” The artifact spirit’s eyes gleamed with excitement.

As Luo Tian left, the sixtieth layer space returned to calmness. The clouds dispersed, and after the lightning bolts struck the ground, they began to fade.

Luo Tian landed on the ground. Upon landing, he immediately sat in meditation, reciting the Mind Demon Scripture to stabilize his demon altar.

At this moment, Luo Tian’s elixir field was chaotic. His original demon altar had completely shattered; after all, he had only needed to withstand nine lightning bolts. But he had endured countless—no less than twenty. The thunder energy had all gathered in his elixir field, and the terrifying power was not just refining his demon altar but had shattered it entirely.

Luo Tian appeared in the sixty-first layer, his face pale. Cold sweat dripped from his forehead, and his eyes showed a serious expression. If he messed up, his entire cultivation might be lost. He dared not take it lightly.

“Dahei, Erhei, protect me! Xiaqi, come out too. If anyone attacks me, burn them!” Luo Tian waved his hand, instantly summoning the two dogs and Xiaqi.

As soon as Luo Tian completed this, a black bear roared toward him. Its towering body possessed explosive power, like a mountain of darkness. The fierce aura made Luo Tian’s heart tremble.

“Roar!” Dahei and Erhei roared, their bodies returning to their original forms as they rushed toward the bear.

The black bear’s strength was even shocking Luo Tian. Fortunately, it wasn’t at the level of an immortal king but was close to that.

“Hold on!” Luo Tian roared, then ignored the battle. He had no energy left to manage other fights.

“Boom…” The demon altar exploded, striking Luo Tian’s elixir field. He felt as if his elixir field would explode, a terrifying wave spreading from it.

“If it explodes, I’m definitely dead!” Luo Tian was terrified. His elixir field was the place where his cultivation had been condensed to its peak. If it exploded, the power would be even more terrifying than his self-destruction.

Luo Tian dared not be careless. He immediately began to vigorously recite the Mind Demon Scripture, and under life-threatening circumstances, he unleashed infinite potential. The speed of reciting the Mind Demon Scripture was more than double his usual pace.

As the Mind Demon Scripture circulated, Luo Tian no longer felt as much pain. Black demon patterns began to appear in his elixir field, and a fragment of the demon altar, no larger than a fingernail, appeared. Luo Tian almost cried.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian cursed, his demon altar had originally been as large as two hands. After this ordeal, it was reduced to such a small size. This was only because he had rescued it in time; otherwise, there would be nothing left, and the situation would have been even more complicated.

While cursing, Luo Tian began to gather the demon energy again, reassembling his demon altar. Time passed slowly. For a full hour, Luo Tian focused entirely on gathering the demon altar. After this extremely thorough refinement, his strength had improved significantly.

As Luo Tian just recovered, he hadn’t even wiped the sweat from his brow when he suddenly opened his eyes. He was deeply concerned about the battle of the three dogs, as that black bear looked quite formidable.

“Roar…” As Luo Tian opened his eyes, he was stunned. A wave of fragrance entered his nose, and a fierce roar echoed in his ears.

“This…” Luo Tian stared at the scene before him, utterly amazed. In front of him were nine-colored flames hovering in place. Two massive bear paws hovered above the flames, and the two big dogs’ mouths drooled as they stared at the continuously sizzling bear paws.

Xiaqi, with a small braid on her head, also had gleaming eyes. She occasionally spat out a flame, making the nine-colored flames even more intense.

Near the three of them was a cage made of nine-colored flames. The massive black bear lay there, its body covered in wounds and blood spilling everywhere. It let out a fierce roar but was powerless now, no longer showing its former ferocity.

After being stunned for a moment, Luo Tian relaxed. His three dogs’ strength was no longer beneath him, and Erhei had also improved significantly. Its strength was peculiar. As for Xiaqi, there was no need to mention it—those nine-colored flames could burn anything.

The black bear hadn’t reached the immortal king level, and the three dogs and Erhei were kings of beasts. They had a suppression over ordinary fierce beasts, so defeating this bear was no problem.

“Ugh…” As Luo Tian thought about it, the three dogs brought a large bear paw to him, offering it as if to please him.

“Wow, you really know how to do this. You learned from Zhan Biao, right? That kid just loved grilled food!” Luo Tian couldn’t help but smile. He didn’t take it further, instead focusing on the black bear in the nine-colored flame cage. On the bear’s head, he noticed a Sanskrit mark.

“Let me study it; maybe it’ll help me!” Luo Tian spoke softly, allowing the three dogs to eat meat while he passed through the nine-colored flame cage and approached the bear.

“Who is this kid? Could he be a reincarnation of some great immortal? He has so many amazing things with him!” The artifact spirit was gritting his teeth, sitting in his place. As long as the bear wasn’t dead, Luo Tian wouldn’t have passed this trial, so he could only watch helplessly.

“Roar…” The bear, though severely injured, remained fierce. Seeing Luo Tian approach, it struggled to stand up and charged toward him.

“Sit down!” Luo Tian coldly snorted, slapping the bear’s head with a palm and subduing it.

“What is this mark? How do I unlock it?” After subduing the bear, Luo Tian stood on its massive head, staring at the Sanskrit mark. His brows furrowed as he tried to deduce how this mark was formed.

“Om Mani Padme Hum!” As Luo Tian just started to deduce, a solemn Buddhist chant echoed in his mind, striking him like lightning.

Chapter 2367: Om Mani Padme Hum

“Om Mani Padme Hum!” An aged voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, causing his soul to tremble. Blood spilled from his mouth as he staggered back, gazing at the Sanskrit mark on the bear’s head.

Just one sentence had stunned him. Cold sweat dripped from his face, and he dared not continue to deduce.

“Terrifying. The person who engraved this mark must be an immense immortal, just like the Black and White Yama!”

Luo Tian muttered to himself. Though it had seemed fast, after hearing that Buddhist chant, he felt as if time had passed for a long while. He even had an urge to worship and believe in the person who recited that mantra.

“I suppose if I continued to deduce, I would end up like Monkey King!” Luo Tian muttered to himself. He stopped deducing; it was too terrifying.

“Daring to try to deduce the Buddha’s mark? That’s truly seeking death. Even an immortal king trying to deduce it might be converted by the Buddha!” The artifact spirit said with disdain, watching Luo Tian spitting blood in the scene.

The two big dogs and Xiaqi didn’t know about Luo Tian’s danger, eating happily. Luo Tian let out a long sigh and stepped out of the cage, looking at the dying bear. He wanted to give it a quick death.

But Luo Tian couldn’t; he really didn’t want to proceed with the next trial. He had no confidence, so he could only delay as long as possible.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian watched the bear gradually lose its life, letting out a long sigh. He knew the bear wouldn’t die but would appear here in a special way. Also, the bear’s strength might not be that strong.

A seventh-grade elixir fell into Luo Tian’s hand, making his eyes light up. At least it was useful.

“Seventh-grade Giant Strength Elixir. After taking it, the user’s physical strength increases!” Luo Tian’s eyes brightened. Elixirs that could refine the body were extremely rare, and this Giant Strength Elixir was something he had never heard of.

Before Luo Tian could think more, a humming sound echoed. He gathered Xiaqi and the three dogs, looking at the changes in the surroundings before vanishing from the spot.

“Rippling…”, as he appeared, a sound of flowing water was heard. The Milky Way’s water came down from the sky; a massive waterfall appeared in Luo Tian’s view.

The澎湃 waves struck against giant stones, producing an ear-splitting sound. Luo Tian’s face showed admiration.

“Cross the waterfall to pass, with a time limit of three days!” The artifact spirit’s voice echoed. As expected, the waterfall had increased in height by three thousand feet and its water volume had multiplied several times. Luo Tian’s lips twitched.

“You really want to kill me!” Luo Tian couldn’t help but speak, looking at the surging waterfall. Even an immortal king would have to be careful.

“Die for me!” The artifact spirit mocked Luo Tian, waiting for him to be crushed into blood by the waterfall.

“My physical body!” Luo Tian thought. His most confident aspect was this physical body.

“Let’s try it; after all, there are three days!” Luo Tian muttered to himself and stepped toward the waterfall. The closer he got, the more he felt the torrent’s overwhelming aura, making it hard for him to breathe.

“Let’s go! My physical body is comparable to an immortal king, so what are you?” Luo Tian gritted his teeth and transformed into a streak of light, rushing toward the waterfall.

“Plop…” Water surged over him, almost knocking him to the ground.

Luo Tian’s physical body was no pushover; it endured the pressure and moved forward, but what stunned him was that this waterfall seemed endless.

After walking for three breaths, Luo Tian activated the Heaven-Devil Dao Method. He could clearly feel his pressure lessened slightly, but it was still terrifying.

“This waterfall is a hundred feet long. How will you pass?” The artifact spirit’s eyes were filled with anticipation, but after the previous lesson, he dared not say Luo Tian was definitely dead.

“Ten feet… twenty feet…” Luo Tian kept shouting, unsure how long he would have to walk. However, the power of the Heaven-Devil Dao Method was gradually decreasing, and Luo Tian felt his body becoming heavier.

“Can’t do it… I need to go back!” Luo Tian suddenly turned around, feeling thirty feet was his limit. If he continued further and couldn’t escape, his physical body wouldn’t withstand it.

His body turned around, and he rushed back thirty feet, escaping the waterfall and collapsing on the ground. His clothes were soaked through.

As soon as he exited the waterfall, Luo Tian took deep breaths, but felt unusually relaxed. His body had shifted from extreme compression to relaxation, a sensation that was incredibly pleasant.

“Hmm?”

“My physical body seems stronger!” Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with light, feeling his body had indeed become a bit stronger.

“Refining. This violent冲击 is dangerous but also an effective method to refine the physical body!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed admiration. He stretched his body and stepped forward again toward the waterfall.

Luo Tian was very excited. At this moment, he was still at the threshold of an immortal king and couldn’t find any method to refine his physical body. Unless he broke through his cultivation, allowing his body to elevate another level.

Luo Tian never expected that the Zhao Tian Pagoda would have something that could enhance his physical body. Such a good opportunity was impossible to miss.

“Old bastard, I didn’t expect you to be this clever. You wanted to kill me, but it turned into a means for me to enhance my strength!” Luo Tian muttered in his heart. He wanted to see the scene of the artifact spirit spitting blood.

“Three days, if you can’t hold out, I’ll have a reason to kill you myself! Ha!” The artifact spirit watched Luo Tian going in and out of the waterfall, laughing wildly.

“One… two…” Luo Tian kept trying, pushing himself to break through his physical limits. He even stopped using the Heaven-Devil Dao Method, letting the waterfall strike him directly.

As Luo Tian kept pushing himself, his physical body changed and strengthened continuously. With each enhancement, he could go deeper into the waterfall, now able to reach seventy feet.

This was still being cautious; with his current strength, he could definitely break through one hundred feet.

“This is too变态!” The artifact spirit watched Luo Tian retreat from seventy feet, his lips twitching.

“Only one day left. I hope this kid is still stupid enough not to break through a hundred feet!” The artifact spirit prayed in his heart. As long as one day remained, he could act.

“Seventy feet already… how much more is there?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly, gazing at the waterfall still falling. His eyes showed confusion but also joy. In two days, his physical body had strengthened to an unbelievable level, though it wasn’t as strong as an immortal king in the middle stage. It had surpassed the early stage of an immortal king.

“Another day, let’s see if it can reach the middle stage of an immortal king. If so, I won’t fear Zhihong. Using the Mind Demon Body Break, with this physical body, I can reach the early stage of an immortal king!” Luo Tian muttered to himself and flew into the waterfall again.

Time passed slowly. One day was about to end, and the sun in the sixty-second layer gradually turned red.

“Almost there, almost there. Kid, I’ll personally kill you soon! Ha!” The artifact spirit’s eyes were filled with excitement as he watched Luo Tian return to the outside of the waterfall, rubbing his fists.

“Not much time left for me!”

“Last one. Full power to push once, no turning back!” Luo Tian muttered to himself and shook his body, rushing into the waterfall again.

With full power, Luo Tian’s speed was fast because he didn’t consider returning. His body surged forward quickly.

Waves rolled, and as the water struck him, he reached fifty feet in a moment. The cold waves hit his strong body.

“Go all out!” Luo Tian roared, having walked this distance countless times in these three days.

“Almost there!” The artifact spirit stared at the gradually turning red sun, looking at Luo Tian with anticipation.

“Ten feet… twenty feet…” Luo Tian walked slower, his eyes fixed on the path ahead. He had walked thirty-five more feet, leaving only fifteen feet to the exit.

“Eighty-five feet. This is my limit these days, but my limit should be one hundred and seventy feet because I won’t turn back!” Luo Tian took a big step forward, pushing again. Ninety feet… ninety-five feet. Luo Tian noticed a glimmer of light, his eyes flashing with light.

“Done!” Luo Tian and the artifact spirit spoke at the same time. The blood-red sun turned black-red, looking strange.

“Roar…” Water dragons rolled, and at the same time, Luo Tian’s figure rushed through the hundred feet and exited the waterfall range.

“Damn it!” The artifact spirit cursed, just now that water dragon was controlled by him. If he had a few more breaths, he could have completely killed Luo Tian.

“Too simple!” Luo Tian panted, appearing in a cave. In the cave, a point of light appeared in Luo Tian’s view—a golden pearl, radiating radiant divine light.

“Sarira!” Luo Tian’s eyes brightened. He recognized what this was, as he had once absorbed one before.

“Kid, give it to me. I’ll use it for a snack!” The Bountiful Stone flew out without hesitation, rushing toward the sarira.

Luo Tian didn’t stop him. The Bountiful Stone had saved him multiple times, and it had been running around these days. A sarira was something Luo Tian could afford to give up, and for him, it wasn’t a big deal. Plus, now that he was a demon cultivator, absorbing the sarira wasn’t good for him.

The Bountiful Stone flew up and directly collided with the golden sarira. That seemingly solid sarira shattered instantly.

Chapter 2368: Ten Thousand Souls Pay Homage

The golden divine light disappeared in the cave, and the Bountiful Stone emitted a strong suction force, absorbing that light.

“变态!” The artifact spirit cursed, watching the place where Luo Tian was. He couldn’t find the Bountiful Stone’s presence; instead, he saw Luo Tian directly absorbing the infinite holy light into his body.

“Why don’t you die from it!” The artifact spirit watched the cave return to calmness, thinking about how to deal with Luo Tian next.

However, from the sixtieth layer to the seventieth, the artifact spirit’s limit was not to make the difficulty exceed an immortal king. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian, this变态, to actually pass so many layers. Even an immortal king in the early stage would only be slightly faster than Luo Tian when passing through the sixtieth to seventieth layers.

“Eighty…”, the artifact spirit finally turned his gaze toward Meng Wushuang and Zhihong. Meng Wushuang had reached the eighty-first layer but seemed stuck there.

Zhihong, on the other hand, was still at the sixty-seventh layer. When Luo Tian first entered the Zhao Tian Pagoda, Meng Wushuang was at that level.

“Right! The sixty-seventh layer. That’s the place to kill this kid. Previously, the one who reached eighty-one was stuck at sixty-seven for years!” The artifact spirit’s eyes lit up, abandoning the difficulty of other layers. His eyes glared fiercely at the sixty-seventh layer.

“Eighty-one!” Luo Tian’s face showed admiration, his heart sensing it. Once someone broke through the eightieth layer, those below would sense it.

“Damn it, there really is someone!” Zhihong’s face darkened. He was郁闷 to the point of wanting to spit blood, but he didn’t know how to deal with the sixty-seventh layer. This trial was too difficult for him.

Around Zhihong, a wave of gray energy filled the space. A series of roars echoed into his mind.

“Ten thousand…”, Zhihong’s face showed a bitter smile, feeling he would have to stay here for at least a year to succeed. This was only because he had mastered the Buddha’s teachings. Others would take years just to succeed.

With a bitter smile, Zhihong resumed reciting the sutras again. A series of divine lights radiated from his body.

After the Bountiful Stone devoured the sarira, Luo Tian also entered the sixty-third layer. He was surprised to find that this level’s difficulty wasn’t as hard as the previous two, and he passed through with effort.

Sixty-fourth layer… sixty-fifth layer…

Time passed slowly. After three days, Luo Tian was surprised to have passed three trials in a row, which he found unexpected. Though these three trials cost him some effort and injuries, compared to before, it was much better.

“What’s going on? Has your conscience awakened?” Luo Tian muttered in his heart. All the things obtained from these three trials were taken by the Bountiful Stone.

“Can’t be, this bastard previously was determined to kill me. It won’t be so simple!” Luo Tian felt uneasy, and his body appeared in the sixty-seventh layer.

“Roar…” As he appeared, a series of roars echoed through the world. A wave of gray energy filled the entire space.

“Soul… countless souls!” Luo Tian looked at the dark space, which seemed like a paradise for souls.

“How many souls are there!” Luo Tian couldn’t help but exclaim. These souls were countless, coming from unknown places, yet their strength was exceptionally powerful.

“Haha, kid, this is a gift I’ve prepared for a long time!” The artifact spirit laughed and spoke to Luo Tian.

“One year, subdue ten thousand souls for yourself!” The artifact spirit’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, making his face show surprise.

“Roar…” As the artifact spirit finished speaking, the countless souls roared. Their gray eyes looked at Luo Tian.

“This is the Demon Subjugation Sutra. Practice it well. One year, if you can’t subdue them, I’ll personally send you to your death!” The artifact spirit’s voice was filled with delight. He had given Luo Tian the shortest time, making Luo Tian’s strange look more intense.

“Subdue means they obey me, right?” Luo Tian muttered to himself, looking at the roaring souls.

“Yes, none of these souls can be missing. If three are destroyed, I’ll destroy you!” Before Luo Tian started, the artifact spirit’s voice echoed again in his mind.

“This condition is almost harsh…” Luo Tian muttered to himself. For others, this was extremely difficult, but for Luo Tian, it was effortless.

Meng Wushuang and Zhihong were also trapped here. Meng Wushuang had already passed, but Zhihong was still reciting the Demon Subjugation Sutra daily, carefully subduing those souls. Although the artifact spirit had given Zhihong some leniency, there was still a time limit. Fortunately, Zhihong had mastered the Buddha’s teachings and deeply understood the Demon Subjugation Sutra.

Luo Tian recalled the Demon Subjugation Sutra in his mind and sat cross-legged on the ground, reciting it.

As Luo Tian recited, the surrounding souls remained unaffected. Moreover, he felt some discomfort; his demon energy resisted and opposed that subjugation force.

Even more shocking was that he wanted to stop but couldn’t. His mouth spoke on its own, and his heart felt a desire to worship the person who created this Demon Subjugation Sutra.

After an hour, Luo Tian finally stopped. His demon energy also calmed down. His eyes showed intense shock.

“This is definitely not just subduing souls. Once you get in, you can’t escape; it’s about worshiping the Buddha who created this sutra!” Luo Tian muttered to himself, his eyes showing fear. This was the first time he had encountered such a strange situation.

“Can’t use it. I don’t want to become someone’s disciple!” Luo Tian muttered in his heart, forcing himself out of the state where he wanted to recite the Demon Subjugation Sutra again.

“Practice, try to see if I can enhance my strength. It’s not a year, right?” Luo Tian muttered to himself and sat cross-legged, beginning to practice. As for those souls, he only emitted some soul-restraining aura, and they dared not approach him at all.

“Giving up?” The artifact spirit furrowed his brows, watching Luo Tian sitting cross-legged. He didn’t know what Luo Tian was up to. If it were before, the artifact spirit would have definitely thought Luo Tian was dead, but after the previous lesson, he wasn’t sure anymore.

“No matter what, we’ll know the result in a year!” The artifact spirit yawned and closed his eyes, planning to wake up after a year. After all, there was nothing else to do now.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian didn’t know how others were doing, but he himself was like a monk in meditation, sitting cross-legged. Except for a few times when lightning struck him and refined his demon altar, he had been practicing all the time.

This year was very precious for Luo Tian. Under life-threatening circumstances, he felt a sense of urgency and refined his demon altar several times. His demon altar was now extremely stable. Luo Tian was confident that unless it was like the previous situation in the sixtieth layer with an abnormal lightning sea, he could handle it normally by practicing the Mind Demon Scripture.

At this moment, in Luo Tian’s elixir field, black demon energy continuously churned. A dark demon altar floated in the swirling demon energy, emitting a powerful aura.

“Refine one more time. Once my cultivation is sufficient, I can try to break through the immortal king!” Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, estimating the time. There were only seven days left until a year.

“This kid is still slacking off!” The artifact spirit also opened his eyes, yawning and watching the scene of Luo Tian.

“Almost there. It doesn’t matter a few more days!” Luo Tian muttered to himself, and his aura suddenly burst out. The thunderous sound spread in all directions. Those gray souls immediately roared, and the entire space of the sixty-seventh layer’s souls all howled, bowing to Luo Tian.

“Roar…” The entire world roared. Even the souls’ Sanskrit marks became unstable.

It was a fervent reverence, an inner reverence. Ten thousand souls paying homage made the artifact spirit widen his eyes in disbelief.

One soul after another opened its mouth, spitting out gray energy that凝聚 toward Luo Tian.

“Are these souls crazy?”

“They’re even giving their soul power to this kid!” The artifact spirit watched the souls spitting out gray energy and couldn’t help but exclaim.

Luo Tian’s eyes flickered slightly. He didn’t refuse and opened his mouth, absorbing those gray energies into his body. His soul began to strengthen.

It lasted for a full day, and only then did Luo Tian finish refining those soul energies. His aura had grown to the level of an early immortal king.

It was just a show of power, not truly being an immortal king. It didn’t have the cultivation or domain.

“I can’t guarantee anything!” Luo Tian looked at the souls filled with hope, speaking softly.

“But I can promise that if I or my ancestors become the master of this Zhao Tian Pagoda, I will grant you legitimacy!” Luo Tian spoke to those souls, and they bowed again.

“Hum…” A wave spread. Those souls disappeared from Luo Tian’s view, and his figure appeared in the sixty-eighth layer.

“Damn it!” The artifact spirit was furious. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to escape again.

“Ha…”, as soon as Luo Tian appeared in the sixty-eighth layer, like Luo Tian, the monk Zhihong who was stuck at the sixty-seventh layer also laughed. Around him, ten thousand souls radiated divine light.

At the same time, Zhihong’s body disappeared from the sixty-seventh layer. Obviously, he had also passed the test. Zhihong’s body was even radiant with divine light; reciting a year of the Demon Subjugation Sutra had greatly enhanced him.

In the sixty-eighth layer, a black elephant appeared in Luo Tian’s view. A smile appeared on his face.

“Now I can even challenge an immortal king without fear!” Luo Tian smiled and flew forward toward the elephant.

Chapter 2369: Reencountering Zhihong

The golden elephant rushed toward Luo Tian, collapsing the void. Its body radiated a powerful aura, but Luo Tian showed no fear. He transformed into a streak of light and collided with the elephant without any tricks.

“Boom…”, in an instant, a large and small body collided. The thunderous sound was overwhelming. However, Luo Tian only took a few steps back, while the massive elephant body flew backward and let out a mournful roar. Its body fell thousands of feet, landing on the ground.

Luo Tian moved quickly and rushed toward the elephant again. With a thunderous sound, he stepped on the elephant’s body.

“Boom…” One step down, the massive elephant body was instantly crushed by Luo Tian. Blood spread in all directions.

“Zhihong, I hope you don’t go too fast!” Luo Tian looked at the changing scenery and spoke coldly. He really wanted to meet Zhihong to test his enhanced strength.

The artifact spirit watched Luo Tian easily passing the sixty-eighth layer. He had no choice but to watch helplessly as Luo Tian passed through, having already used his authority to maximize the difficulty. Yet he couldn’t stop it; there was no other way.

“There are still so many layers. Eventually, I’ll kill him!” The artifact spirit muttered to himself, but his words lacked confidence. He had already begun to doubt whether Luo Tian would definitely die.

The sixty-ninth layer was also smoothly passed by Luo Tian, and he appeared in the rest space of the seventieth layer.

“First, I need to deal with those monks!” Luo Tian didn’t know which level Zhihong was at, but he knew that Zhihong’s companions definitely weren’t as fast as him in passing through the trials.

As Luo Tian just sat cross-legged, wanting to wait for Zhihong’s companions, a series of fluctuations appeared in the seventieth layer space.

“Is it so fast?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly, opened his eyes and looked toward the direction of the fluctuations. He flew forward.

As Luo Tian moved, Zhihong also appeared in the seventieth layer. His eyes showed urgency because he sensed that person had already entered the eighty-third level.

“Zhihong!” But as soon as Zhihong appeared, a cold voice echoed in his ear, making him slightly startled.

Zhihong was stunned for a moment. Luo Tian had already attacked, his powerful fist striking Zhihong fiercely.

“Luo Tian!” Zhihong was also a strong person. He immediately reacted, and golden light rose from his body. He also punched.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed. Luo Tian’s body took a few steps back, while Zhihong showed an expression of surprise. His body took a step back and collided with the seventieth layer’s boundary, looking at Luo Tian who rushed toward him again.

“Die!” Zhihong roared and slapped his golden hand, pressing down on Luo Tian. At the same time, a domain instantly covered thousands of feet, pressure spreading from Zhihong’s body.

Luo Tian activated the Heaven-Devil Dao Method, resisting Zhihong’s domain power. In an instant, Luo Tian rushed forward again. This was his greatest advantage—his physical body. He knew that although he had become stronger, to defeat Zhihong, an immortal king, he still needed his body that had surpassed the early stage of an immortal king.

Luo Tian punched again, using a flurry of punches to create three shadow fists. They collided with the golden hand and stopped Luo Tian.

“Kid, you’ve become stronger. But you’re still a trash!” Zhihong moved his hands, sensing Luo Tian’s physical body had increased significantly. After the brief confrontation, he realized that Luo Tian had this plan.

“Golden Buddha Seal!” Zhihong moved his hands, and a golden seal fell from the sky. It radiated overwhelming power, pressing down on Luo Tian.

The golden seal emitted divine light and pressed against the heavens. Luo Tian’s face slightly changed. He wasn’t afraid of fighting Zhihong with his physical body, but he was afraid of clashing with Zhihong’s martial arts. This was his weakness.

But Luo Tian had no time to think of other things. The golden seal gave him a powerful pressure. He raised his hands and met the golden seal.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed in all directions. Luo Tian’s body suddenly sank, almost kneeling on the ground. His entire body trembled violently.

“Try again. I want to see how many times you can endure!” Zhihong’s face showed a cold smile. He moved his hands, and the golden seal fell again from the sky, pressing down on Luo Tian.

The heavens roared. The surrounding of the golden seal emitted a series of explosions, making Luo Tian’s face look grim. Zhihong’s martial arts were smoothly connected; Luo Tian had no chance to rush toward Zhihong.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s face darkened. He punched, and five shadow fists instantly merged to collide with the golden seal.

“Crack…” Thunder echoed. The golden seal was instantly shattered by Luo Tian’s punch, causing him to spit blood.

“Wang!”
