“Enough talk. All thirty thousand disciples of the Tian Dao Sect may enter. The one who stays longest and travels farthest shall receive a reward—a high-grade artifact of the Earth rank and an eighth-tier elixir!” The sect master of Tian Dao Sect spoke, his gaze directed toward Luo Tian.

“An eighth-tier elixir and a high-grade Earth rank artifact?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly, then his eyes gleamed with sharpness. He already suspected these two treasures were crafted by Sichuan Chen.

“My master’s belongings—I shall not let them fall into others’ hands!” Luo Tian resolved within his heart. No matter what, he could not allow Sichuan Chen’s treasures to be taken by others.

The sect master's words had barely finished when the disciples of Tian Dao Sect grew even more fervent. A high-grade Earth rank artifact was already priceless to them; securing first place meant a chance at it. Plus, the eighth-tier elixir was also a treasure of world-shattering rarity.

“Enough. I now declare—Reincarnation Bridge, open!” The sect master of Tian Dao Sect announced loudly.

As the sect master’s words faded, nine elders from the nine sects displayed solemn expressions. Standing atop their respective mountain peaks, they rapidly moved their hands, sending invisible waves from their palms toward Tian Dao Sect’s plaza.

“Hum…” A powerful aura that made hearts tremble gathered above Luo Tian and others’ heads.

“Rise…” The nine elders spoke in unison, their aged hands grasping at the void.

Under the nine elders’ grasp, thirty thousand disciples of Tian Dao Sect displayed excitement. A transfer force spread to each person’s body.

“Thirty thousand disciples all transferring!” Luo Tian felt a storm of shock within him, awed by the nine elders’ prowess.

But before Luo Tian could be further stunned, in an instant he found himself in a dim environment.

Luo Tian landed on the ground. As soon as he steadied himself, he heard the sound of flowing water. A river stretching endlessly lay before his eyes.

What puzzled Luo Tian was that the river’s waters were gray. Though not rushing, he could sense hidden currents within it—entering would surely bring him no good.

Beyond the river, he saw a bridge spanning across it. The bridge’s other end was also invisible.

“Is this the Reincarnation Bridge?” Luo Tian murmured to himself, sighing inwardly. Others must have faced the same situation.

At Tian Dao Sect, a massive screen appeared. Countless light points flickered on it—approximately thirty thousand in total.

“How many disciples will enter the Soul-Annihilation Realm this time?” The elders all slightly opened their eyes, gazing at the thirty thousand light points with a touch of anticipation.

“This opportunity is hard-earned. I must see what special features this Reincarnation Bridge has that makes Tian Dao Sect’s disciples so eager!” Luo Tian displayed a hint of anticipation. Without hesitation, he stepped onto the black bridge.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian’s foot touched the Reincarnation Bridge, an invisible wave rose from beneath him. Ten gray figures emerged from the river and stood before Luo Tian.

“What is this? A soul? An incomplete one?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed confusion. He stepped his other foot onto the bridge.

“Roar…” As Luo Tian fully stood on the Reincarnation Bridge, his entire body seemed to have its soul drawn out. His soul manifested in another form upon the bridge.

With Luo Tian’s soul appearing, those ten gray figures seemed to have discovered a rare treasure. They moved with semi-conscious intent toward Luo Tian.

“Ah, I see now!” A faint smile appeared on Luo Tian’s gray soul.

“This battle is familiar to me!” Luo Tian chuckled, his gray soul clenching a fist and striking the first approaching gray figure.

“Pound…” The punch landed, turning the gray soul into a wisp of mist that scattered in the air.

“Suck!” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate, taking a deep breath and inhaling the mist. As he inhaled it, Luo Tian felt his soul had slightly strengthened.

“This mist isn’t strong. It’s barely at the Bone-Devouring Initial stage. To me, it poses no pressure and offers little soul enhancement,” Luo Tian sighed softly. He continued punching, and the remaining nine gray figures were instantly destroyed, their mist absorbed into his soul.

Chapter 617: Each Displays Their Abilities

On the Reincarnation Bridge, Luo Tian took one step after another. Every thousand feet he traveled, a soul rose from the river’s surface to block his path. The souls’ strength grew increasingly formidable.

“Bone-Devouring Initial… Bone-Devouring Mid… Bone-Devouring End!” Luo Tian had reached three thousand feet, and the souls’ strength had advanced to Bone-Devouring End. Their number had grown to one hundred.

As Luo Tian passed three thousand feet, his soul had become more solid. He could feel that after absorbing a little more, his soul would enter the Soul-Annihilation Mid stage—equivalent to the Converging Qi Mid realm.

“Pound…” As Luo Tian stepped into three thousand one hundred feet, the bridge’s surface surged with wind. A group of gray mists flew toward Luo Tian, conveying greedy intent.

“One hundred Bone-Devouring End souls?” Luo Tian’s face showed confusion as he saw the souls blocking his path. He had expected to meet a Soul-Annihilation realm soul, but instead it was still Bone-Devouring End.

“Quantity doesn’t matter. They’re still just Bone-Devouring End!” Luo Tian chuckled, gazing at one of the Bone-Devouring End souls. He calculated that absorbing these one hundred would allow his soul to enter the Soul-Annihilation Mid stage.

“Roar…” The one hundred souls, upon seeing Luo Tian, did not immediately charge at him. Instead, they rotated around him continuously.

“I see… They use formations! It seems as one travels farther, the souls’ strength increases alongside their intelligence. I wonder if something terrifying awaits at the end,” Luo Tian’s gaze deepened, looking toward the invisible end of the Reincarnation Bridge.

“Hum…” Strange waves emanated from the one hundred Bone-Devouring End souls as they circled around Luo Tian.

Luo Tian inhaled sharply, feeling his soul become unstable under this strange wave and a sensation of being drawn into the circle.

Luo Tian growled, forcing himself to resist. But his soul was uncontrollably moving toward the circle.

“Ugh…” As Luo Tian’s soul approached them, the one hundred Bone-Devouring End souls intensified their efforts. Their speed increased, emitting a piercing hum.

One step… three steps… Luo Tian slowly moved toward the gray circle. His face showed a struggle.

“Stop!” Luo Tian roared, stepping to the circle’s edge and punching it.

His solid fist plunged into the circle. The fast-moving circle momentarily halted, sending a sharp pain through Luo Tian’s soul.

“Die…” Luo Tian withdrew his fist and punched again. The one hundred souls’ circle slowed further.

“One punch… two punches…” Luo Tian seemed unaware of fatigue, punching repeatedly. The intense pain nearly made him faint.

But his strong will told him he couldn’t pass out; if he did, this opportunity would end.

Finally, after Luo Tian had thrown countless punches, the one hundred Bone-Devouring End souls howled and turned into a storm of gray mist.

Luo Tian inhaled deeply, absorbing the mist into his soul. As he continuously absorbed the gray mist, Luo Tian’s soul became more solid and his aura stronger.

“Converging Qi Mid!” Recovering, Luo Tian’s gray face showed a faint smile. He took another step forward.

At the moment Luo Tian overcame this formation, others also faced similar situations.

Zheng Xin’s mouth twitched. Unlike Luo Tian, she ran alongside the souls with increasing speed, a smile on her face.

Other elders’ descendants also displayed their abilities to break through this formation.

The most astonishing was a black-cloaked disciple who seemed ordinary but radiated an icy aura.

To everyone’s shock, this black-cloaked disciple transformed into a giant Taotie mouth upon encountering the one hundred Bone-Devouring End souls. The powerful suction absorbed all one hundred souls into his body.

Everyone was exerting their utmost effort, for they all knew that enhancing their soul increased the chance of entering the Soul-Annihilation Realm.

Although Luo Tian and others passed this stage, more Tian Dao Sect disciples were blocked by it. They were dragged into the water with cries of frustration.

“Hum…” Waves kept occurring as people fell into the water. On Tian Dao Sect’s plaza, disciples appeared one by one. Within an hour, nearly twenty thousand disciples had emerged.

“Ah… it’s really tough,” someone sighed.

“Yes, I felt I was just a step away from passing. If I had, my soul would have entered the Converging Qi realm. That would’ve made entering the Soul-Annihilation Realm much more likely,” disciples complained, their eyes filled with envy as they gazed at the light points in the sky, hoping to see which disciple would travel farthest.

“Pound…” Luo Tian smashed an initial Soul-Annihilation soul, his face showing a hint of joy. He murmured, “I suppose after passing the Soul-Annihilation stage, my soul will enter Converging Qi End!”

Luo Tian thought for a moment, then punched repeatedly. His soul continued to strengthen and transform.

An hour passed quietly. Luo Tian finally eliminated the ten Soul-Annihilation End souls. His gaze held anticipation as he looked toward the Reincarnation Bridge’s front. He had traveled nearly ten thousand feet, and even looking back, he couldn’t see the other shore. Yet he could feel his physical body’s presence—there was an invisible connection.

With a step forward, Luo Tian stepped into the first ten thousand feet range. His gaze held anticipation as he awaited the soul’s emergence.

“Hum…” Waves spread, and a white figure appeared in Luo Tian’s vision. His eyes instinctively narrowed.

“Fear!” The moment Luo Tian saw the white figure, a sense of fear arose within him.

“I didn’t expect anyone to reach this stage. You’re good; it’s been a long time since I met someone,” the white figure spoke, surprising Luo Tian further.

“Soul-Annihilation Realm soul?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed confusion, his face displaying bewilderment.

Though the Soul-Annihilation Realm was immensely powerful, it hadn’t reached a state where the soul could remain intact after separation. This white figure had exceeded Luo Tian’s understanding.

Chapter 618: Promise Me One Thing

“Do you think I only have the strength of the Soul-Annihilation Realm but my soul remains intact?” The white figure smiled, speaking to Luo Tian.

“Indeed,” Luo Tian nodded, answering honestly but with a serious and alert expression.

“Come on. Defeat me, consume me. You’ll grow stronger and continue forward!” The white figure spoke, its voice echoing far into the silent space.

Luo Tian was curious. This white figure resembled a human but appeared ethereal and elusive. To this point, he hadn’t seen the white figure’s face.

“Don’t be curious. I’ve been waiting for someone to defeat and consume me. When you do, I’ll reveal all your unanswered questions!” The ethereal figure spoke and transformed into a white light, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Kill!” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate. Since the figure attacked him, he couldn’t stand idly by. He sneered and charged toward the white figure.

After their clash, Luo Tian was stunned. Though this white figure was only at the Converging Qi Initial stage and Luo Tian had reached Mid, he felt the figure’s strength. Every attack from his soul was blocked by the white figure. The white figure’s attacks were incredibly sharp, always striking at his blind spots.

“This combat experience is terrifying!” The more Luo Tian fought, the more he was amazed. He hadn’t expected this white figure to be so abnormal.

Both were in soul states, without spiritual energy. They could only fight through实战 (real combat). Luo Tian was certain that if he were at the Converging Qi Initial stage, he wouldn’t last half an hour before losing.

Even so, Luo Tian’s soul was growing weaker. His gray soul showed a hint of anxiety.

“Stay calm… don’t rush! The more you rush, the more flaws you’ll have!” Luo Tian continuously comforted himself, trying to calm his mind.

Meanwhile, others also faced the same situation. They fought against a white figure but were far more helpless than Luo Tian, eventually being knocked into the gray river and transported back to Tian Dao Sect’s plaza.

“Ten thousand… five thousand… one thousand… one hundred…” As time passed, the light points on the screen kept decreasing.

“This is too strong. The white figure’s combat experience is truly overwhelming!” Zheng Xin, looking bitter, was transported back to Tian Dao Sect’s plaza.

Not long after, the screen only had a few light points left, and they kept decreasing further.

“That guy is human?” Ren Hongzhi and others cursed as they were transported out, gazing at the screen.

“Dao Tian, that guy hasn’t come out yet. Good job!” Ren Hongzhi and others looked at the remaining two light points on the screen, their faces showing admiration.

“That guy’s soul is way stronger than us!” Zheng Xin smiled softly, murmuring, thinking of Luo Tian’s terrifying spiritual awareness.

Luo Tian was nearing his limit. If souls had sweat, he would be drenched in it now.

“Can’t keep going like this. I’ll get weaker and weaker. This stage is impossible for ordinary people to pass, even my Converging Qi Mid soul can’t get through. Others definitely can’t either. There must be another way.”

“Combat, combat, stay calm!” Luo Tian defended desperately while thinking of how to break through.

“Combat! Unity with Heaven and Man!” Luo Tian’s gray eyes flashed with intensity. He thought of Chen Changsheng and Chen Zhanbiao, who had greatly enhanced their combat power by entering the Unity with Heaven and Man realm.

“Take a chance. If it doesn’t work, I’ll just give up!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly and began to sense the surrounding changes.

“Did you notice?” The white figure chuckled, its face showing a touch of anticipation.

“One hour… two hours…” As Luo Tian parried the white figure’s attacks, his mind gradually gained clarity. After fighting for an hour, Luo Tian suddenly closed his gray eyes.

“Unity with Heaven and Man. Good!” The white figure softly sighed, its attacks becoming faster and more cunning.

But with his eyes closed, Luo Tian deflected every attack from the white figure and retaliated.

“Good kid!” At Dan Sect, Sichuan Chen’s face glowed with boundless light. He laughed again. Luo Tian reaching this stage was already impressive, but he had entered the Unity with Heaven and Man realm.

“Dao Tian’s kid really changed a lot. He achieved Unity with Heaven and Man on his first time entering the Reincarnation Bridge! I remember back then, only we three achieved it on our first time entering!” Mu Rongcheng smiled, his eyes filled with excitement. He was excited that Tian Dao Sect had a successor and that someone could carry the future of Tian Dao Sect.

At this moment, Luo Tian felt he had entered a mystical realm. This sensation was incredibly ethereal, as if he were the favorite of heaven and earth, forgetting all worries and sorrows, freely wandering in the universe.

Although both Luo Tian and the white figure were in soul states, their souls had nearly become tangible. The dull sound of collision kept echoing between them.

Though the white figure was incredibly strong, it still fell short by one level against Luo Tian in Unity with Heaven and Man. In this state, both defense and attack had no flaws. Finally, Luo Tian struck it down with a punch, turning it into white mist.

“Huh?” As the white figure was destroyed by Luo Tian, he suddenly recalled something and his face showed a hint of joy.

Luo Tian looked at the swirling white mist, his face filled with excitement. He opened his mouth to inhale it into his soul to strengthen himself.

“Hum…” But as soon as Luo Tian opened his mouth, the swirling white mist coalesced again, forming a middle-aged man. He smiled and appeared before Luo Tian.

“Damn…” Luo Tian cursed inwardly, then became alert. He hadn’t expected the soul he had defeated to come back to life. He couldn’t be sure if he could achieve Unity with Heaven and Man again.

“Don’t fear, young man. Since you’ve defeated me, you’ve passed. However, you must promise me one thing; otherwise, you won’t be able to absorb my soul!” The middle-aged man spoke softly, his gaze filled with nostalgia as he looked toward the distant end of the Reincarnation Bridge.

Chapter 619: Zhao Fengshan’s Obsession

Luo Tian showed confusion, gazing at the white figure of the middle-aged man’s soul. He awaited the man’s next words.

“My name is Zhao Fengshan. I was at the Soul-Annihilation Realm in life, but after death, for some reason, my soul was drawn into this Reincarnation Bridge.”

“I never expected to be reborn here. Though I’m powerful on the Reincarnation Bridge, I know I’m just a meal for others. One day, someone will consume me!” Zhao Fengshan’s face showed bitterness.

“Then why don’t you try to leave?” Luo Tian asked, his confusion evident.

“Leave? If I could, would I stay here so long? If I leave the Reincarnation Bridge, I’ll die within half an hour. In fact, I’m already dead now. But I’m unwilling!” Zhao Fengshan’s face showed madness.

“I’m unwilling to die without knowing who killed me. I only remember living peacefully with my wife, unbothered by the world. But I died inexplicably, and I don’t even know who killed me or how!”

“I’m unwilling to become a wandering soul without the chance of reincarnation. I miss my wife. She’s within less than ten thousand feet, but to me, it’s a distance between heaven and earth!” Zhao Fengshan’s face showed endless anger, as if venting.

“Pity,” Luo Tian sighed softly, his eyes filled with sympathy.

Not knowing who killed him or how he died, and his wife also on the Reincarnation Bridge but unable to meet.

“What I ask of you is to carry my soul and see my wife—just once. Then let you consume me. Otherwise, it’s difficult for you to absorb my soul now!” Zhao Fengshan’s face showed a plea, his eyes filled with tension.

Luo Tian sighed softly. He knew Zhao Fengshan was lying; he could feel that absorbing Zhao Fengshan would pose no pressure. This was the rule of the Reincarnation Bridge—no one could defy it.

“Alright, I promise. But I can only try my best!” Luo Tian nodded slowly under Zhao Fengshan’s expectant gaze.

Zhao Fengshan’s plight reminded him of Chen Yunting. He and Chen Yunting were also separated by death, unsure if they’d meet again.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Zhao Fengshan’s face showed great joy. Under Luo Tian’s astonished gaze, he coalesced into swirling white mist, waiting for Luo Tian to absorb it.

“Body, come here!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered. He communicated with his physical body.

In an instant, Luo Tian’s physical body at the bridge head transformed into a streak of light, rushing toward Luo Tian. It appeared before his soul state.

The soul and physical body merged. With eyes closed, Luo Tian opened them again. He waved his hand, and a bronze cauldron appeared before him.

“This…” Zhao Fengshan, who had reformed into human shape, showed a touch of fear. He could clearly feel the bronze cauldron’s special suppression over him, as if touching it would instantly disintegrate.

“Pound…” Luo Tian struck the cauldron’s lid with his palm, a smile on his face. He spoke to Zhao Fengshan: “Old Brother Zhao, come into the cauldron quickly. I’ll take you to find your wife!”

“This!” Zhao Fengshan’s face showed a touch of hesitation. After looking at Luo Tian’s calm gaze, he finally made up his mind and transformed into a streak of white light, rushing into the Soul-Pacifying Cauldron.

“Pound…” Seeing Zhao Fengshan enter the cauldron, Luo Tian’s face showed a smile. He closed the cauldron’s lid again and stored it in his storage ring. To Luo Tian’s surprise, the Soul-Pacifying Cauldron could still fit into a storage bag after absorbing Zhao Fengshan’s soul.

Under Luo Tian’s surprised gaze, his physical body and soul merged for less than half an hour before being separated by the Reincarnation Bridge’s repelling force.

“Go!” Luo Tian sighed softly. Though he hadn’t consumed Zhao Fengshan’s soul, his soul remained at Converging Qi Mid. Yet he felt no regret.

Watching his physical body leave the Reincarnation Bridge, Luo Tian sighed again and continued walking deeper into it.

Without enhancing his strength, Luo Tian’s pace slowed. He encountered souls at the Soul-Annihilation Initial stage and had to search for Zhao Fengshan’s wife among these fragmented souls, making his progress as slow as a tortoise.

“Good! This kid is good!” The nine elders, seeing Luo Tian’s actions, showed smiles.

“This is my disciple!” Sichuan Chen spoke loudly, his voice echoing across Tian Dao Mountain.

“This Sichuan is already showing off! Ugh…” Hearing Sichuan Chen’s voice, the other eight elders all frowned.

“Only one Zhang Daotian remains! I never expected him to stay the longest!” The disciples of Tian Dao Sect showed shock. They couldn’t believe that this usual second-generation aristocrat had changed so drastically in these months.

First, he bizarrely lost the Tian Dao Thunder Sword to Ma Xiujie. Then he promised the elders he’d win it back within half a year. He even publicly beat Ma Xiujie, cutting off one-third of his soul. And he had even gotten together with Yao Biyue from the Wenxin Sect.

These events left people stunned. Now, he was shining on the Reincarnation Bridge. This was completely different from the previous Zhang Daotian, who no one dared to provoke. Some even thought Zhang Daotian might have been possessed by someone.

“Zhang Daotian! I don’t know who you are, but killing my Western people, you’ll definitely have no good outcome!” The last disciple to be transported out, a black-cloaked youth, showed cold killing intent, gazing at the light points in the sky.

Luo Tian didn’t know what others thought. He just took one step after another forward, relieved that after entering two thousand feet, although the residual souls’ strength had increased to Soul-Annihilation, they no longer appeared in groups of ten or twenty. Obviously, residual souls at the Soul-Annihilation stage weren’t easy to collect.

“No!” Luo Tian smashed a Converging Qi Initial soul, his face showing disappointment. This was the seventy-sixth he had found. Based on his estimation, this one thousand feet range should be Converging Qi Initial souls. If he went further, it would likely be Converging Qi Mid—making things harder for him.

“Hope I can find Zhao Fengshan’s wife, or before that, my soul reaches Converging Qi Mid. Otherwise, I’m unsure if I can withstand Converging Qi Mid souls,” Luo Tian murmured softly. His gray figure continued forward.

Chapter 620: The Wound of the Heart

“Do you think Luo Tian can break the record set by Master Sichuan, traveling five thousand feet?” The disciples of Tian Dao Sect whispered among themselves.

On Tian Dao Sect’s plaza, everyone gazed with anticipation at the single remaining light point on the sky screen.

“Pound…” Luo Tian smashed the last Converging Qi Initial soul within ten thousand feet, inhaling it into his soul. His face showed a hint of joy.

“Converging Qi End! Time, just in time!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed a smile. He took another step forward toward the endless Reincarnation Bridge.

As expected, moving deeper, he encountered only Converging Qi Mid residual souls. Though they had no consciousness, they were immensely powerful. Luo Tian continued to strengthen his soul while searching for Zhao Fengshan’s wife.

“One… ten… sixty…” Luo Tian counted each residual soul he had eliminated.

“Sixty-three! Hmm?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed joy, gazing at this light and airy soul.

“I found it!” Luo Tian felt Zhao Fengshan’s strong call from the Soul-Pacifying Cauldron beside his body. He sighed in relief, surprised to have encountered Zhao Fengshan’s wife’s residual soul.

But Zhao Fengshan’s wife was clearly much weaker than Zhao Fengshan. Unlike him, who preserved his consciousness through a single thread of obsession, she had no awareness like other souls.

“Roar…” Though Luo Tian stopped his attack, Zhao Fengshan’s wife didn’t heed his pause. She howled and attacked Luo Tian, her gray face showing greed.

“Body, come!” Luo Tian roared. His physical body rushed toward him under immense pressure. Luo Tian quickly merged with it, summoning the Soul-Pacifying Cauldron to absorb Zhao Fengshan’s wife into it. He no longer cared; he believed Zhao Fengshan would find a way to awaken his wife’s latent consciousness.

As soon as Luo Tian absorbed Zhao Fengshan’s wife into the Soul-Pacifying Cauldron, an instant later, he was separated from his physical body. A cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears: “Warning once—no summoning of the body, or you’ll be kicked out of the Reincarnation Bridge!”

Luo Tian was speechless but didn’t take it too seriously. He continued fighting the Converging Qi souls, moving forward without searching for Zhao Fengshan’s wife. His speed noticeably increased, but he still fought for half an hour before finally eliminating one hundred Converging Qi Mid souls.

At this point, Luo Tian’s soul was just one step away from reaching Converging Qi End. He was thrilled, feeling his soul’s strength. His goal was to enter the Soul-Consolidation Realm, also known as the Transcendent Realm!

With a step forward, Luo Tian’s eyes showed anticipation. He awaited the residual soul that would elevate him in the gray river.

“Rippling… rippling…” As Luo Tian took a step, the gray river surged with waves. A powerful whirlpool rose in the river, making Luo Tian’s eyes narrow slightly.

A white figure floated before Luo Tian. Like Zhao Fengshan, this white figure was hazy but Luo Tian could discern it was a woman.

“A woman?” Luo Tian sighed inwardly. A woman with such powerful soul strength must have had high cultivation in life.

“Who are you? Why do I feel so familiar?” A soft voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. He was startled.

“This voice—I’ve heard it before!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed confusion, searching his memory to recall this woman’s voice.

As he recalled, the voice gradually merged with a woman’s in his memory. Luo Tian’s face showed disbelief.

“You… can you speak again?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed excitement, trembling as he spoke these words.

“Why should I speak? But why do I feel so comfortable with you? Who are you!” The white figure murmured, as if questioning herself and also Luo Tian.

As the woman spoke again, Luo Tian’s heart was excited. His gray solid figure instantly appeared before the white figure. He embraced her and whispered, “Yunting! I searched for you so hard!”

As Luo Tian embraced the woman, at four thousand feet away on the Reincarnation Bridge, his physical body’s eyes—closed—tears flowed down and fell into the rolling gray river.

“Yunting? Who is Yunting? Why do I feel no rejection, but instead a sense of security?” The white figure’s voice showed confusion. She stood there dazed.

“This is the third gift Master once mentioned!” Luo Tian’s heart was excited, recalling what Zhang Daotian had said about the third gift in the ancient relic land.

“Master! Thank you!” Luo Tian murmured softly, his heart filled with warmth. His gray eyes showed tenderness toward the white figure.

“You are Chen Yunting, yes. My wife. Come with me and leave this place? I am Luo Tian!” Luo Tian spoke softly but didn’t release Chen Yunting’s soul, whispering to her ear.

“Luo Tian. A familiar name. Why can’t I remember?” Chen Yunting again showed confusion, calling Luo Tian’s name softly.

“Alright, I’ll take you away first. But you must endure for a while. Once I find a way, I’ll revive you!” Luo Tian’s fist clenched tightly with determination. His physical body transformed into a streak of light, rushing toward Luo Tian and Chen Yunting.

In a few breaths, Luo Tian’s physical body reached his soul. Knowing the time was urgent, he quickly merged with it and summoned the Soul-Pacifying Cauldron to store Chen Yunting’s soul inside.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian finished this, a powerful repelling force swept over him.

“Summoning the body three times—kicked out of the Reincarnation Bridge!” A cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. In an instant, he was pushed off the Reincarnation Bridge by an irresistible force.

Chapter 621: Nether River Water for Forging the Golden Body

The cold voice echoed, and Luo Tian was instantly pushed out of the Reincarnation Bridge into the gray river below.

But his face showed satisfaction, a smile, and warmth. He felt no regret for not continuing further on the Reincarnation Bridge.

Because seeing Chen Yunting’s soul here was a great fortune and blessing for him. To not continue further was nothing compared to this. He even sacrificed his life for it.

Although Chen Yunting’s soul looked abnormal, seemingly not recognizing him and not being complete, Luo Tian was already content. Compared to Chen Yunting who had died, her soul’s appearance gave him great hope.

“Plump…” Luo Tian smiled as he fell into the gray river.

But in an instant, his mind felt puzzled. As soon as he entered the water, he sensed a transfer force. But this force wasn’t strong—it gradually increased.

Then, he felt an immense coldness enveloping his body and mind. He felt as if countless souls had wrapped around him.

“This is a Nether River! This river is composed of countless residual souls!” His eyes flashed with waves as he fell in.

“Ah! This river is gray! How many souls must have formed this Nether River!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly.
