“Long Baobao, where is Luo Tian?” Leng Qiu Chan did not see Luo Tian’s figure and felt a sudden sinking in her heart.

“I… I don’t know either!” Long Baobao’s face showed innocence, clearly unaware of where Luo Tian had gone.

“Trouble! That fire must be Luo Tian’s Fen Tian Fire Array. Luo Tian is in danger!” Zheng Xin felt a sudden shock, knowing that the Fen Tian Fire Array was one of Luo Tian’s most powerful techniques. To use it meant his opponent was certainly formidable.

Leng Qiu Chan and Zheng Xin were not foolish; Luo Tian’s decision to face the enemy alone without them suggested he had little confidence.

“Let’s go!” Without hesitation, they grabbed the dazed Long Baobao and vanished from the inn.

At that moment, Luo Tian’s forehead was already drenched in sweat. Yet his face bore a smile—his Fen Tian Fire Array was immensely powerful, and combined with the fierce winds at the edge of Jifeng Valley, it amplified his technique’s strength. It could rival a mid-level grade martial art.

A sea of fire spread across the sky, showing no signs of fading. Instead, it grew fiercer with the wind.

Luo Tian did not know if he could survive within the fire, but he was certain that if Xiu were in it, even if he didn’t die, he would be severely wounded. His spiritual awareness could not penetrate the overwhelming fire.

“Huff…” Within a dozen breaths, Luo Tian’s fire-element spiritual energy was drained. He took deep breaths, his spiritual awareness sensing the surrounding charred land and the warmth radiating from the ground.

“This is the benefit of elemental affinity!” A hint of joy appeared on Luo Tian’s face.

“Still, to be safe, I should give it my all!” Luo Tian sighed softly. He knew this terrifying young man was not as easy to defeat as he seemed. His hands extended again.

The Huang Ji Yin (Imperial Seal) fused faster with each use. Combined with his current Bone-Transformation peak cultivation and terrifying spiritual awareness, even a single Shen Hun Yin (Soul Sealing Seal) was overwhelmingly powerful. Imagine the combined strength of two techniques.

An imperial aura appeared in the open sky, and the character “Huang” formed slowly under Luo Tian’s fusion, radiating a suppressing presence.

“Bone-Transformation stage—definitely Bone-Transformation! And likely at its peak!” From the distant Luoyang Town, people gazed in awe at the character “Huang” floating in the sky. Their hearts trembled, unsure which Bone-Transformation elder was performing it.

Three figures rushed through the wind outside Luoyang Town.

“Luo Tian!” Zheng Xin’s face showed anxiety as he called softly. If they still couldn’t recognize it was Luo Tian, they would have wasted their lives.

“Whoever forced Luo Tian to use the Huang Ji Yin must be a formidable opponent!” Leng Qiu Chan felt anxious, her eyes showing panic. She didn’t know why, but a bad premonition stirred in her heart.

“Huff… You’re strong. Truly strong. For years, you are the first to make me so helpless—and even wounded!” A cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears.

“Indeed, you’re not dead!” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly. His spiritual awareness controlled the Huang Ji Yin floating in midair, waiting to deliver a fatal strike.

“To show my respect, if you can withstand my next attack, I’ll spare your life today!” Before Luo Tian could speak, Xiu’s words fell again.

“You won’t kill me? Heh. Today I’ll kill you!” Luo Tian’s face turned ruthless, his spiritual awareness directing the Huang Ji Yin to crush Xiu’s figure.

“Hmph?” Sensing the Huang Ji Yin approaching, Xiu halted his attack mid-motion, his face showing disbelief.

“It can’t move!” Xiu’s usually calm expression changed. A flicker of fear stirred in his heart—he never expected this seemingly terrifying Huang Ji Yin to carry such an overwhelming imperial pressure, rendering him completely immobile.

“Peng…” In Xiu’s stunned gaze, the Huang Ji Yin landed on his figure again.

Dust scattered; the Huang Ji Yin, accompanied by a powerful wind sound, vanished into the world with a resounding roar.

“This time, I wonder what qualifications you have to be arrogant in front of me!” Luo Tian’s face bore confidence. He was certain that no one could survive the Huang Ji Yin at Bone-Transformation stage.

Combined with his previous Fen Tian Fire Array, two of his strongest techniques had struck Xiu. Luo Tian knew even if Xiu was extraordinary, he doubted he could emerge unscathed.

“Cough… I admit I underestimated you. This time, I’ll let you go. Don’t die; next time I won’t give you another chance!” Xiu’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, making his lips curl slightly.

Though the voice was still Xiu’s, it had lost its former confidence and was now far weaker. However, Luo Tian found himself troubled—his spiritual awareness could only detect the dark silhouette but not Xiu’s true form.

“Alright, I’ll wait for you!” Luo Tian’s face showed confidence. He had never feared anyone at his level.

The Liewang Spear landed in his hand, and he launched it toward the dark silhouette in his spiritual awareness, face cold.

“Peng…” The Liewang Spear struck the ground fiercely but bore a streak of blood on its surface.

Chapter 402: Storm Approaches

Chapter 402: Storm Approaches

Luo Tian instantly appeared beside the Liewang Spear, grabbing it. He chased after the figure in the distance.

“Still trying to escape? You won’t get away!” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly. Sensing the figure moving away, he unleashed his remaining spiritual energy to activate the Fengtian Step (Sealing Step), chasing after the dark silhouette.

“Chasing me?” Running, Xiu’s face turned pale. A bloodstain on his shoulder was clearly visible. Seeing Luo Tian chasing him, Xiu’s face showed mockery—his confidence in his speed and concealment techniques was absolute.

As he spoke, Xiu’s figure suddenly accelerated. In the dark night sky, it resembled a cloud of darkness, gradually distancing from Luo Tian.

“Huff…” Sensing Xiu growing farther away, Luo Tian sighed deeply. He knew his current speed couldn’t catch up. If he exceeded a hundred feet, he would lose the target entirely.

Standing still, Luo Tian didn’t know where he was. He had been so focused on chasing Xiu that he forgot to mark the path. All he knew was the wind grew stronger, even affecting his cultivation.

“Am I about to enter Jifeng Valley?” Luo Tian’s face flickered with uncertainty. He didn’t want to enter Jifeng Valley without Zheng Xin’s guidance. Though he didn’t know how dangerous it was, he had been in Dahan Forest and knew the ferocious beasts there were beyond what a few sects could handle.

As Luo Tian pondered, his spiritual awareness extended ten thousand feet. Leng Qiu Chan, Zheng Xin, and Long Baobao’s figures appeared in his spiritual awareness. A slight smile formed on Luo Tian’s face as he prepared to meet them.

But just as he was about to rise, a powerful whirlwind suddenly rose from behind him, sweeping Luo Tian into it.

“Stop…”

“A storm! It’s still thousands of miles from Jifeng Valley. How could a storm form? This is impossible! Why?” Zheng Xin’s face showed shock, fear in her eyes as she gazed at the dark sky.

“Damn it, retreat!” Zheng Xin stared at the whirlwind piercing through heaven and earth, which made the entire world seem darker.

“What do we do? Luo Tian must be inside!” Leng Qiu Chan felt a tremor in her heart. She knew the storm’s terror within Jifeng Valley, but she had clearly felt Luo Tian’s aura nearby. Yet, upon seeing the whirlwind, it vanished from her intuition.

“Brother…” The most sensitive among them, Long Baobao, showed excitement on his face. He could clearly sense the immense destructive power within the whirlwind—his dragon clan body might not withstand it.

Leng Qiu Chan and Long Baobao rushed toward the whirlwind like madmen. The only clear-minded Zheng Xin, however, used all her strength to block them.

“You two are crazy! That’s a whirlwind. Even an Elder-level master would be torn apart!” Zheng Xin shouted at them, but the wind made her voice weak.

“Move aside, or I won’t hesitate to fight you!” Leng Qiu Chan’s sword was drawn, her face cold. At that moment, she only cared about Luo Tian’s life.

Long Baobao was more direct than Leng Qiu Chan, ignoring Zheng Xin entirely. He slammed into her, pushing her far away while spitting blood from his mouth.

“Hmph…” Leng Qiu Chan let out a cold huff, sheathed her sword, and rushed with Long Baobao toward the massive whirlwind.

“Damn it! I’ve had bad luck for eight lifetimes!” Zheng Xin’s face showed anxiety. She hadn’t even wiped the blood from her lips when she spat out a mouthful of blood, her body swirling like a whirlwind and reappearing before Leng Qiu Chan and Long Baobao.

“Leng Qiu Chan, listen to me. Are you sure Luo Tian is inside? If not, you’re going to die! How will I explain this to Luo Tian?”

“I’ll tell Luo Tian you, a foolish woman without a heart, died with him!” Zheng Xin roared, stopping Leng Qiu Chan’s movement.

“Long Baobao…” Leng Qiu Chan took Long Baobao’s hand, her face serious.

“You have a connection with your brother. Tell me how your brother is doing!” Leng Qiu Chan’s face was icy, even startling Long Baobao.

Hearing Leng Qiu Chan’s command, Long Baobao closed his eyes. His entire body emitted a faint golden light, his face showing deep concentration.

After a short while, Long Baobao’s face showed relief: “I can feel my brother’s condition is poor but he’s still alive!”

“Huff…” Hearing Long Baobao’s words, Zheng Xin finally sighed deeply. Her gaze carried reproach toward Leng Qiu Chan.

“Now you’re relieved? The priority now is to enter Jifeng Valley. The storm outside is clearly not normal. We should go in early and find out what’s happening!” Zheng Xin’s gaze held reverence as she looked at the whirlwind connecting heaven and earth.

Nature’s power was truly awe-inspiring. Humans could fight beasts, humans could fight others, but since ancient times, no one had ever dared to challenge the heavens. Though cultivators faced tribulations, it was merely a slight resistance against heaven. Before heavenly might, anyone was an ant.

Leng Qiu Chan’s face showed complex emotions as she gazed at the whirlwind, nodding slightly. At that moment, she felt a bit nervous.

Though Long Baobao was worried, his youth allowed him to recover quickly after sensing Luo Tian wasn’t dead. He followed the two toward another entrance of Jifeng Valley.

At that moment, Luo Tian was also anxious. It had been too sudden—the whirlwind had appeared so abruptly beneath his feet, leaving him no time to react before being swept up.

He didn’t know where he was now. All he knew was that he had used his remaining spiritual energy to protect himself.

Even so, Luo Tian could feel the immense pulling force. If he relaxed even slightly, he would be torn apart instantly, like that entire mountain turned to rubble in a few breaths.

That wasn’t the worst. The worst was the sand and unknown minerals flying in the wind, piercing his body and creating blood holes.

Chapter 403: Entering Jifeng Valley

Chapter 403: Entering Jifeng Valley

The powerful whirlwind stretched across heaven and earth. Its immense suction even made people in Luoyang Town feel it, though they were too far away to be affected.

Even so, most body-building cultivators rushed out of the town. They feared this terrifying storm would sweep toward their town, leaving them no chance of survival.

Luo Tian was now in the eye of the storm. His clothes were torn and ragged, his face pale with countless wounds across his body—blood holes appeared everywhere. He was wrapped in blood.

“Damn wind!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly. His spiritual energy was clearly insufficient now. Relying on his body alone, he knew he would be torn apart within a moment.

His heart raced. He didn’t know what to do, and a strong sense of danger rose within him—this danger was no less than when he had been dragged into Yang Huanyu’s strange array.

“Want my life? Even if you are heaven, it won’t work!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with madness. He forcibly took out a pill from his storage ring.

The pill barely touched his hand before it was blown away. Luo Tian’s face turned red. He had tried this before, but the pills were always blown away instantly.

“Come back to me!” Luo Tian roared, his face wild. He forced himself against the strong resistance and grabbed the pill.

“Peng…” A fist-sized stone hit Luo Tian’s arm, instantly shattering.

This blow made his already wounded arm worse. His bone even showed a crack. However, Luo Tian’s effort wasn’t in vain—his hand clutched the pill tightly, like a lifeline.

Luo Tian’s face showed great joy. Amidst the hurricane, he forced himself to swallow the pill.

“Hum…”

The pill entered his mouth. Luo Tian took a deep breath, relieved. This was one of his few six-star pills, given to him by Lu Kunpeng.

The pill dissolved instantly. A torrent of spiritual energy filled Luo Tian’s withered meridians and elixir field.

Luo Tian’s face slightly relaxed. However, he didn’t let his guard down. He knew he could only endure temporarily. He had no idea where this hurricane would take him or what dangers awaited.

“Thunder… thunder!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly. He knew the hurricane was too strong, drawing clouds into it. Over time, they accumulated and formed rolling lightning.

A bolt of lightning slowly passed near Luo Tian, its thickness like a fist. The arc made his heart tremble. It struck a blue stone near Luo Tian, which he couldn’t identify.

But he was certain this stone was incredibly hard. Though it was only as big as a table, countless stones had smashed against it and crumbled to dust. Yet this blue stone remained unscathed.

“Peng…” The thunder struck the stone, creating fine cracks. Luo Tian’s lips twitched.

“What to do!” Luo Tian slowly looked up amidst the hurricane, watching the lightning arcs. His face turned pale. He wasn’t sure how much stronger his body was than that stone.

In truth, he had survived so far mostly due to luck. He hadn’t encountered anything particularly hard. If he met a stone like that, he would be pierced through. A simple ordinary stone could hurt him; how much more so for this incredibly hard one?

What terrified Luo Tian even more was the terrifying lightning arcs within the hurricane. His heart trembled.

“Can’t go on like this. I won’t be struck by lightning, but I’ll be scraped to death by stones!” Luo Tian’s mind raced.

“Lightning… lightning tribulation!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed. He suddenly remembered the time when Lu Kunpeng had used his help to pass through a lightning tribulation!

“Zhen Hun Ding (Soul-Subduing Cauldron)!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with light. He thought of his treasure.

“Hum…” A powerful aura radiated from Luo Tian’s hand, a suppressing presence rising within the hurricane. The entire storm seemed to pause.

Luo Tian forced the Zhen Hun Ding into his hand. Though it was heavy, it couldn’t match the hurricane’s power. It steadied him slightly but still followed the whirlwind.

The appearance of the Zhen Hun Ding calmed Luo Tian somewhat. His face showed hope as he tightly gripped its ears. He kicked the sealed lid open with one foot.

A dark opening appeared in Luo Tian’s vision, making him hesitate to enter for a moment.

“Crack…” Another lightning arc, thick as an arm, passed near Luo Tian and struck the Zhen Hun Ding. The cauldron emitted a continuous humming sound.

“Either way, I’ll die. It’s better than being struck by lightning!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with ruthlessness. He didn’t hesitate and, with his frail body, rushed into the Zhen Hun Ding.

“Peng…” As Luo Tian entered the cauldron, a green stone struck the spot where he had stood.

Luo Tian didn’t know it. As soon as he jumped into the Zhen Hun Ding, he felt like falling into an endless abyss. His entire body felt no gravity. The surroundings were pitch black, and his spiritual awareness was completely suppressed the moment he entered.

Luo Tian had once entered the Zhen Hun Ding in Dahan Forest, but that time he was forcibly dragged into it by the cauldron. He hadn’t entered with his body, and this situation was completely different from when his soul had entered.

This was the first time Luo Tian had entered the Zhen Hun Ding. He felt a mix of fear and awe, for it was a grade-land treasure. Luo Tian even thought the Zhen Hun Ding was more advanced than the Suo Ling Tower (Locking Spirit Tower), as he had cultivated the latter but had no clue about this one.

The roaring sound continued in Luo Tian’s ears. He guessed it was the sound of sand and stones hitting the cauldron from outside.

Luo Tian sighed in relief. Though the Zhen Hun Ding was dark, he felt grateful for being inside it compared to the terrifying storm outside.

However, Luo Tian didn’t know that at the moment he entered the cauldron, a huge uproar spread across Tianyuan Continent.

Chapter 404: Did Luo Tian Die?

Chapter 404: Did Luo Tian Die?

On the Tianyuan Continent, important disciples of major sects had devices to sense their safety. For example, the Yiming Sect in the Southern Region used "Ming Pai (Life Token)," while the Wuxing Sect in the Northern Region used a "Hun Deng (Soul Lamp)."

After the battle with the Tianshi Sect over a year ago, Wuxing Sect had suffered heavy losses. The entire peak of Houtu had rebelled, causing severe damage to the sect. It took over a year for them to recover gradually.

At that moment, Zhang Ziping walked into a grand hall among the disciples cleaning the courtyard. Since Luo Tian had been transported away by the portal, Zhang Ziping visited this hall daily to check on Luo Tian’s soul lamp and confirm his safety. Even if he couldn’t come, he would have Lei Yong or Ji Chen check on Luo Tian’s safety.

As usual, Zhang Ziping entered the hall and immediately found Luo Tian’s soul lamp among the many. However, when he looked at it, his entire body trembled. His eyes widened, filled with bloodshot.

His gaze fell on Luo Tian’s soul lamp, which was gradually dimming. In the next moment, under Zhang Ziping’s trembling gaze, Luo Tian’s soul lamp went out in less than a breath.

Zhang Ziping couldn’t believe it. He rubbed his eyes, confirming he hadn’t made a mistake. Tears flowed down his face instantly, his eyes turning blood red. His entire body seemed struck by lightning and fell to the ground.

“Who, who! I Zhang Ziping swear, no matter who you are or which sect you belong to, even if you’re a great immortal, I will destroy your entire clan within my lifetime!” Zhang Ziping’s wail echoed throughout the Wuxing Sect, making everyone tremble in fear.

“What happened?”

“Who made Zhang Senior so upset?” All the disciples of Wuxing Sect were shocked. They could hear the madness and endless hatred in Zhang Ziping’s voice.

“Is it Little Brother?” Lei Yong and Ji Chen heard Zhang Ziping’s voice. Their faces shook violently, and after a brief thought, they realized this was the time to check Luo Tian’s soul lamp. Their hearts felt like being stabbed, and their spiritual energy fluctuated. Two wings—black and green—formed, and they vanished from the spot.

Other peak masters like Wei Mingxuan also showed surprise. They disappeared from their respective peaks, heading toward the sound’s direction.

In the Southern Region’s Glacier, a couple in white robes looked at each other. Their eyes showed despair.

“Puke…” The woman spat blood, staining her white robe red. Her face was pale to the extreme.

“Boom…” The man’s body trembled violently, and a thousand-foot-high mountain nearby collapsed with a roar.

“Why? Why can’t I sense Tian’er’s aura? Tell me why!” The woman screamed at the man, her voice wild.

“Impossible! Impossible! He’s my son. How could this happen!” The man also showed sorrow in his eyes, whispering repeatedly.

“Impossible! Impossible! You just say impossible. I’ve waited for thousands of years, and what did it get me? Separation from my flesh and blood! Thousands of years, I haven’t seen my son for thousands of years!” The woman screamed wildly.

“I’ll go find my son. Even if it’s just a corpse, I can’t let my child die without anyone to bury him. Whoever dares touch my son, I’ll make them pay with blood! Yes, blood for blood!” The woman, like a madwoman, her black hair turned half white instantly. She looked soulless and walked toward the glacier’s exit.

“Yue’er, listen to me. Wait a little longer!” The man showed anxiety on his face. He could sense his wife’s current state was very unstable.

“Get out of my way! I won’t wait anymore! I’ve waited eight thousand years, and this is the result? Today if you block me, don’t blame me for breaking our marital bond!” The woman’s face showed coldness. Her sword trembled.

The man looked at the woman’s determined gaze and hesitated: “Okay. I’ll go with you.”

“Don’t need it. You keep your promise, and I’ll bear the guilt of breaking it!” The woman said softly. She shouldered her sword, and her body appeared in the sky. Her eyes gazed deeply at the man before vanishing into the sky.

“Haha, kid, go quickly. Your son is most important!” A tempting voice echoed from a vast void crack.

“Go to hell…” The man’s eyes showed pain. His sword hummed, and he rushed into the crack.

“Damn it! You two couples will one day be my downfall. If I escape, I’ll extract your souls and burn them for forty-nine days!” A wailing voice echoed from the crack.

In the Northern Region’s Dahan Forest, Long Jian and his wife showed a calm expression. However, Long Jian’s face soon turned grim.

“What’s wrong?” His wife Bai Yuqin noticed his change in expression and asked.

“I can’t sense Luo Tian’s aura anymore. Even the faint trace of my reverse scales has vanished. My spiritual body, though it had been wounded before and recovered over time, could now reach the peak of Elder level. But now I can’t even make it appear!” Long Jian’s face was serious as he looked at Bai Yuqin.

“You mean Luo Tian had an accident?”

“But I can still sense Long Baobao is safe through the bloodline!” Bai Yuqin, hearing Long Jian’s words, immediately became tense.

“That’s what confuses me. If Luo Tian had an accident, it’s unlikely Long Baobao would survive either!” Long Jian furrowed his brows.

“Elder Second, Elder Third! You two! Go to the Eastern Region and investigate. Once you find Luo Tian and Long Baobao, bring them back to Dahan Forest immediately!” After a brief thought, Long Jian’s voice rang out with authority in the Dahan Forest.

“Roar…” A black tiger and a black gorilla heard Long Jian’s voice, growled softly, then transformed into two men before vanishing from the Dahan Forest.

In the Eastern Region, Leng Qiu Chan and Zheng Xin had already entered Jifeng Valley. However, Leng Qiu Chan didn’t have the heart to admire the valley’s grandeur; her mind was preoccupied with Luo Tian’s safety.

Long Baobao also lacked energy, showing no interest in anything shiny.

Suddenly, as Long Baobao was walking, his face turned pale. He stopped and sat on the ground, looking sorrowful.

“Ah… Brother… Wuwu…” Under Leng Qiu Chan and Zheng Xin’s gaze, he began to wail.

Chapter 405: Three Fists to End Life

Chapter 405: Three Fists to End Life

Seeing Long Baobao crying, Leng Qiu Chan and Zheng Xin’s hearts sank. They stopped and returned to Long Baobao.

“What’s wrong, Long Baobao?” Leng Qiu Chan asked with a trembling voice.

“I… I can’t sense my brother’s presence anymore!” Long Baobao said only one sentence before continuing to cry.

“Cough… cough…” Though it was just a sentence, Leng Qiu Chan’s face turned pale instantly. She coughed up blood, staining her black veil red.

“Impossible! How could he die!” Leng Qiu Chan whispered.

Zheng Xin was also shocked. He had previously prevented Leng Qiu Chan from going to her death by assuring her that Luo Tian might still be alive.

Now, with Long Baobao—connected to Luo Tian—saying he couldn’t sense his presence, it meant an 80% chance that Luo Tian had died. This left Zheng Xin unsure of what to do.

What troubled Zheng Xin even more was losing a friend. His face turned pale, and the three stood motionless on the road, surprising the disciples of Jifeng Valley.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian—responsible for all this—was comfortably in endless darkness. At first, he was curious and explored constantly. His body tried to move but found no anchor.

After struggling for a while, he gave up and let himself fall. He listened to the roaring sounds from outside.

But then, a terrifying thought struck him: he didn’t know how long he had been falling. If this continued, when he finally landed, would he be crushed?

The more he thought about it, the more likely it seemed. The more he thought, the more terrifying it became. His previously calmed mind returned to tension.

“What should I do? Will I be the first to die at Bone-Transformation peak?” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, his mind racing.

“Liewang Spear!” Luo Tian roared. The spear landed in his hand and he thrust it forward, but it hit nothing.

“Indeed, as I thought!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed. He put the spear away and formed the hand seal for Yanlong Shou (Flame Dragon Hand).

However, what surprised Luo Tian was that after he cast the Yanlong Shou, there was no light. His vision remained dark.

“What’s going on?” Luo Tian became more confused.

He then tried to ignite the light element, but his vision remained dark as if his eyes were covered by darkness.

“What the hell is this place?” Luo Tian cursed loudly, his voice echoing far away.

Loneliness. In this vast and lonely space, Luo Tian felt an intense loneliness. There was no concept of time; he didn’t know how long he had been in the Zhen Hun Ding.

No spiritual energy, no cultivation! No one to talk to—silence was terrifying. There were no sounds at all, not even the sound of wind as he fell endlessly.

Fear. Deep fear filled Luo Tian’s heart. If someone could see him, they would notice his eyes turned blood red, and his state was like a madman.

This feeling had never been experienced by Luo Tian. He would rather fight an Elder-level master than stay in the Zhen Hun Ding for even a moment. He would rather face the storm and lightning outside than this endless darkness and fear.

Luo Tian’s mind was tight. He didn’t know when he would land, and this feeling added more fear to his heart.

After a long time, Luo Tian no longer heard the roaring sounds outside. Yet his body continued to fall.

“Roar…” Luo Tian roared, trying to release his fear and loneliness. But he was disappointed; he couldn’t hear his own voice, as if his body wasn’t his.

One fist. Two fists. Luo Tian continuously punched around him, his face wild and eyes red like a lone wolf in black clothes.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian completely lost his mind, continuously punching himself to relieve the loneliness and fear with physical pain.

“Mie Sheng (End Life)!” Luo Tian roared. Still, nothing happened. The Mie Sheng Fist struck his body.

One hundred years of vitality vanished instantly from Luo Tian, restoring a bit of clarity to his lifeless eyes.

“Roar…” Luo Tian opened his mouth wide, as if roaring. Another punch struck him. Blood spewed from his mouth, making his face paler. The second Mie Sheng Fist took another hundred years of vitality, and Luo Tian’s eyes became clearer.

“Another time!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with madness. He roared inwardly and delivered the third punch.

Blood spewed from Luo Tian’s mouth, making him even weaker. Three hundred years of vitality left him in a terrible state.

When Duan Xingchen had lost one hundred years of vitality, he was severely weakened. Now, three hundred years for Luo Tian was a massive loss.

Three Fists to End Life—Luo Tian’s face turned pale, but his eyes were sharp and clear. He was no longer confused.

“Peng…” As the third punch landed, Luo Tian felt a sensation. It was as if he had fallen onto a large cotton ball, making him slightly relieved. He was terrified of falling on ordinary ground and being crushed into meat paste.

Feeling the softness beneath him, Luo Tian—now extremely weak—didn’t want to get up. His head was dizzy, and his eyelids were heavy.

Just as Luo Tian was about to close his eyes, a deep voice echoed in his ears: “Although you passed the first test, you are not destined for me!”

The voice faded. Luo Tian’s weak body was pushed back into endless darkness by the Zhen Hun Ding’s powerful rejection force.

“Damn it…” Luo Tian finally couldn’t help but curse. Fortunately, this time he could hear his own voice.

“What the hell is this? You almost killed me. You say you’re not destined for me!” Even someone with good temper would lose their calm in this situation. Let alone Luo Tian.

Though he had no strength to shout, three hundred years of vitality made him heartbroken. Three centuries—his current Bone-Transformation peak meant he had only over a thousand years to live.

But no one answered Luo Tian’s words. Just moments later, he was expelled from the Zhen Hun Ding.
