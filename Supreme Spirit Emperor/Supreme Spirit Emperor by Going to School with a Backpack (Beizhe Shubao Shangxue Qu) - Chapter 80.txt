“Roar……” Luo Tian let out a low growl, his crimson Qi intensifying until it obscured his form, rendering his expression invisible to onlookers.

As if numb, Luo Tian swung his fist again—only to miss. His scarlet eyes slowly lifted toward the sky.

At ten thousand zhang above, Lian Changshan stood with a mocking smile. But as Luo Tian’s gaze met his, Lian Changshan instinctively shivered.

Then, Lian Changshan shook his head slightly. How could Luo Tian possibly leap to such a height?

“Youngster, this is why the Nascent Soul Realm surpasses the Bone-Subjugation Realm—it allows us to fly through the skies, while you cannot!” Lian Changshan sneered.

From below, a disciple of the Spirit-Embracing Sect glared at Lian Changshan, who appeared as small as a fly in the sky. “How shameless! The Spirit-Embracing Sect has such dishonorable elders—it’s a disgrace!”

Even the dozen Nascent Soul Realm elders who had blocked Cold Hongcai’s path wore scornful expressions.

Hearing the disciples’ curses, Lian Changshan’s lips twitched, but he inwardly cursed: “If this kid weren’t so abnormal, who’d want to endure this humiliation?”

Just as Lian Changshan exhaled in relief and reached for a medicinal pill to heal his chest wound, an icy aura suddenly locked onto him. He shivered violently, dropping the pill.

Luo Tian’s scarlet lips curled into a smirk. The Rending Sky Spear materialized in his hands, but instead of unleashing a technique, he planted it into the ground.

With arms raised slightly, crimson Qi coalesced from his palms, solidifying into a tangible form.

A blood-red bow emerged before the onlookers—its body and string both crimson. Luo Tian barked a command, drawing the Rending Sky Spear across the bowstring.

Due to its immense size, Luo Tian planted a foot on the bow’s frame and slowly drew it back.

“Hummm…” A surge of Qi rippled outward, scattering the surrounding crimson aura. A chilling killing intent radiated from the bow to the spear.

The Rending Sky Spear hummed, its already crimson surface now wrapped in blood-red slaughter Qi.

“Luo Tian, fight!” The crowd watched with eager anticipation, hoping Luo Tian would achieve the impossible—defeating a Nascent Soul Realm elder with Bone-Subjugation Realm prowess.

At full draw, the bowstring trembled under Luo Tian’s grip. The air crackled with power.

“A crushing pressure… I feel like I couldn’t withstand this!” A mid-level Nascent Soul Realm elder trembled, watching Luo Tian.

Cold Hongcai furrowed his brow, sensing Luo Tian’s body spewing crimson Qi in waves.

“Flee! You must flee!” Lian Changshan’s face contorted as death loomed.

“Luo Tian, stop! That’s an elder!” A voice rang out, but no one dared intervene.

Luo Tian ignored them, his sole focus the desire to kill Lian Changshan.

Sweat poured from Lian Changshan’s brow as he propelled himself skyward with all his might.

“Die!” Luo Tian’s lips curled into a sinister smile, and he released the bowstring.

“Done!” The elders’ faces twisted in despair—they knew Lian Changshan was doomed.

“But… this shot’s power is immense!” Bone-Subjugation Realm disciples, unaware of its true might, marveled at its strength.

Lightning flashed. In the blink of an eye, the Rending Sky Spear streaked toward Lian Changshan, who soared higher.

Chapter 392: Arrogance

The crimson spear carried a terrifying tearing force, enveloping Lian Changshan in death.

“Can’t escape… block it!” Lian Changshan’s eyes wild with madness, he activated his cultivation technique. The surrounding Qi condensed into a shield before him.

“Crack…” But the Qi shield shattered instantly as the Rending Sky Spear pierced it.

With a “plop,” the spear tore through the shield, impaling Lian Changshan’s face. The destruction severed his head, and the spear shot skyward, vanishing into the horizon.

“Dead…” The Bone-Subjugation Realm disciples gaped as Lian Changshan’s corpse plummeted from ten thousand zhang, striking the ground like a hammer.

“Hummm…” The Rending Sky Spear followed, embedding itself before Luo Tian with a resonant hum.

“Roar……” Luo Tian roared, releasing his pent-up fury, his long hair swirling as he stood.

“Demon!” The crowd’s minds echoed with the word.

Lian Changshan’s death did not clear Luo Tian’s mind—his killing intent merely paused before resuming. His body emitted crackling sounds, and the Book of Epochs in his mind continued transmitting slaughter Qi.

“Kill…” With a thunderous roar, Luo Tian kicked off the ground, seizing the Rending Sky Spear to charge at the surrounding elders.

“What’s he doing?” Bone-Subjugation Realm disciples stared in shock.

“Luo Tian, are you alright?” Zheng Xin’s face bore worry as she addressed him.

Leng Qiuchan furrowed her brow, concern etched on her face. Yet she held back—Luo Tian’s condition was perilous; he might be consumed by slaughter Qi or burst from its pressure.

“Jiang Nanxuan!” Leng Qiuchan suddenly recalled his name, activating her sealing steps and vanishing.

“Qiuchan sister, wait for me!” Zheng Xin’s feet glowed green as she chased after her.

No one noticed their departure; all eyes were fixed on Luo Tian, who had reached the elders.

“Foolish!”
“How dare you provoke our elders’ authority?” The elders glared, their anger fueled by Luo Tian’s audacity in killing Lian Changshan. Had Cold Hongcai not restrained them, they would have slain Luo Tian long ago.

Seeing Luo Tian charge at them, the elders felt both anger and a grim satisfaction.

“Boom…” The elders’ power surged, slowing Luo Tian’s advance.

Luo Tian hunched over, his red eyes fixed on them as he advanced slowly.

“Daring to provoke us? You’ve doomed yourself, Master!” A white-haired elder barked, his face contorted with grief over Lian Changshan’s corpse.

“This matter requires careful deliberation,” Cold Hongcai muttered, frowning.

“Deliberate? This reckless youth must die! He’s a threat to the sect!” The elders roared.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s aura flared, halting his steps. He conjured another blood-red bow, placing the Rending Sky Spear on its string.

“Hiss…” The crowd gasped as Luo Tian aimed the spear at the elders.

This weapon had already stained with an early Nascent Soul Realm elder’s blood—Lian Changshan’s still fresh. Now, it targeted another Nascent Soul Realm master.

The elders’ gazes darkened, especially the early Nascent Soul Realm masters, who trembled at Luo Tian’s audacity.

The Rending Sky Spear’s tip quivered, seeking prey. Luo Tian’s face remained impassive, his scarlet eyes locked on the dozen Nascent Soul Realm elders.

“Hmph! Thinking one shot killed Lian Changshan means you can kill all Nascent Soul masters? How arrogant!” A white-haired late Nascent Soul Realm elder sneered.

“Senior Master!” The early Nascent Soul elders looked to the speaker, hope flickering in their eyes.

“Kill him! He’s already gone mad!” The senior master’s face bore a hint of fear as his late Nascent Soul Realm power flared, a blue sword materializing in his hand.

“Don’t dare touch him! I’ll handle this!” Cold Hongcai’s voice rang out, his eyes icy as he glared at the elders.

“You block the Sect Leader; I’ll kill him!” The senior master frowned, stepping forward and slashing a blade.

The sword’s energy surged like waves toward Luo Tian.

As if guided by fate, the Rending Sky Spear flew from Luo Tian’s grasp, streaking toward the blue sword energy.

Chapter 393: Shocking the Foundation

In awe, the spear and sword energy collided, carving a deep gash in the air.

“Indeed skilled, but today you must die!” The senior master’s sword energy reformed, now ten times stronger. It loomed in the sky.

“Trouble!” Cold Hongcai punched back an early Nascent Soul elder, but a mid-level one appeared before him.

Seeing the senior master’s sword energy, Cold Hongcai panicked—he knew the elder meant business. Though he was at Bone-Subjugation Realm peak, he couldn’t match the senior master quickly.

“This…!” Bone-Subjugation Realm disciples trembled, their legs shaking as they stared at the blue sword energy.

“How will Luo Tian escape? His spear hasn’t returned yet!”
“Even with the spear, he couldn’t block this shot!” The crowd whispered nervously.

“Die!” The sword energy roared downward.

Luo Tian, his eyes blood-red, felt the sky’s pressure and glanced up—but his mind was barely lucid. He couldn’t even think of dodging.

He raised both arms, blood-red Qi surging as he tried to block the senior master’s sword energy.

“Luo Tian, don’t be reckless! Run!” Cold Hongcai’s voice cut through Luo Tian’s mind.

“Too late!” The senior master sneered, his sword slicing downward.

“Dead!” All watched Luo Tian with pity—the sword energy would kill him. A late Nascent Soul Realm master was too strong for Lian Changshan to match.

Luo Tian’s mind cleared slightly, but his body refused to move. He could only watch the sword energy descend.

“Did I really die? No… I haven’t reached Yumen Mountain to rescue Qianxue and Gulei. I haven’t achieved the peak of martial arts to revive Yunting… I still have so much to do…” In that moment, Luo Tian’s mind flickered with thoughts.

But his desperation was futile—he could do nothing but watch the sword energy descend.

“Hummm…” As Luo Tian faced despair, his back’s Nirvana Dragon Seal glowed golden.

At the same time, the jade pendant given by his master Zhang Daotian glowed green.

“Disperse…” A deep voice echoed, and a golden streak shot toward the blue sword energy.

“Boom…” The sky seemed to crack, and dense water-element Qi rained down on the crowd.

As this voice arrived, the Nirvana Dragon Seal and jade pendant calmed, as if nothing had happened.

“Crack…” An energy stone fell from the sky, appearing before the crowd.

“This…!”
“Energy stone?”
“Did this energy stone break the senior master’s sword technique?” The crowd marveled, staring at the stone.

But they soon disappointed—this was just an ordinary energy stone.

“Maybe our cultivation level is too low to notice its secret?” A Bone-Subjugation Realm disciple murmured, looking at the senior master and Cold Hongcai.

Under so many disciples’ gazes, the senior master felt embarrassed. He couldn’t discern the stone’s secret either.

“Hmph…” As people focused on the energy stone, a red lightning bolt suddenly struck the senior master’s face.

“Luo… Luo Tian…” The crowd was stunned—how could Luo Tian still act?

Even the senior master hadn’t expected this. He was sent flying three zhang before stopping.

If it were normal, Luo Tian might not have acted, but this was no longer the same Luo Tian. His mind held only a sliver of clarity; the rest was consumed by killing intent.

Luo Tian, like a beast, lunged at the retreating senior master.

“Stop…” A dignified voice rang out as three figures appeared in the sky, their gazes sweeping over Luo Tian’s attack. A powerful pressure radiated from them.

Cold Hongcai saw the three figures and smiled broadly, bowing: “Cold Hongcai, greetings to the three elders!”

As Cold Hongcai bowed, the other elders also respectfully knelt, not daring to lift their heads.

“Those are the elders?” The disciples gazed with reverence at the three old men, some seeing them for the first time.

At that moment, Luo Tian’s body seemed controlled, his red eyes flickering.

“Greetings to the elders!” The senior master, struck by Luo Tian’s punch and bearing a fist print on his face, dared not heal. He bowed to the three elders.

“Hmph…”
“You’ve truly grown bold, fighting among yourselves! How shameless! You ignore our words, don’t you?” One elder spoke with authority, his aura unassuming yet commanding.

“This child shall be the Sect’s young master. We’ve decided this, so who dares object?” Another elder added angrily.

“Respectfully, I dare not!” The senior master’s face had lost its arrogance, his voice trembling.

“Late Nascent Soul Realm—fighting a Bone-Subjugation Realm peak? You’re old enough to know better. If you wish, stay; if not, leave!”

“And you, Cold Hongcai—your role as Sect Leader is failing. You let these elders act freely. Now they’ve even dared attack you! Your leadership is pitiful!” The three elders scolded the ground like grandparents.

After reprimanding Cold Hongcai, the three elders turned to Luo Tian. Two of them extended their hands, drawing a powerful suction force that pulled the blood-red slaughter Qi from Luo Tian.

The third elder stepped before Luo Tian, his eyes filled with admiration as he extended a green-tinged hand, patting Luo Tian’s body. A sealing force entered his mind.

The Book of Epochs’ final page had opened wider than two years ago at Feiyun Sect. Now, Luo Tian was at Bone-Subjugation Realm peak, capable of withstanding more slaughter Qi.

The Book of Epochs hovered in Luo Tian’s mind, its final page now open a third. Vast slaughter Qi surged outward, engulfing his body.

As the sealing force entered Luo Tian’s body, the Book of Epochs seemed to sense it and increased its slaughter Qi transmission.

“Crack!” Luo Tian’s body couldn’t withstand the immense pressure, cracks spreading across his skin.

“Even a third-opened version can’t withstand my sealing force!” The elder smiled confidently, his hands leaving trails as he sealed Luo Tian.

“Seal!” After half a moment, the elder commanded.

“Hummm…” Sealing force surged through Luo Tian’s body, entering his mind and attaching to the Book of Epochs.

The powerful sealing force acted on the Book of Epochs, and under Luo Tian’s remaining clarity, he felt it slowly closing.

The slaughter Qi within him was drawn out by the two elders’ suction,凝聚 into a blood-red pearl.

Luo Tian’s face paled as he looked at the elder, gratitude in his eyes before he fainted.

“Hmph! This kid is now the Sect’s young master. You’ll take care of him!” The elder on the ground said seriously, addressing Cold Hongcai and the trembling elders.

But what followed shocked everyone. Under respectful gazes, the elder stepped forward, picked up the energy stone that had fallen, and wiped it with his sleeve before placing it in his storage ring.

“This…!” Cold Hongcai and the elders’ mouths twitched.

The disciples gaped, stunned that their revered Reincarnation Realm elder would care about a mere energy stone. The contrast with his image was staggering.

The two elders in the sky also looked at the elder with exasperation. The three soon reappeared above.

Holding the blood-red pearls, the two elders tossed one to Cold Hongcai: “Take this. The rest for the kid. Remember, Sect Leader—kill any who defy you. Don’t hesitate. We’ll grant you three kills of Nascent Soul elders. It’s worth it for the Sect’s stability!”

“Yes.” Cold Hongcai nodded, lifting Luo Tian. His gaze swept over the elders, as if scanning for any who displeased him.

“Enough. Take care of this kid—he may become a great asset to the Sect!” The three elders said, vanishing.

“What did they mean? This Luo Tian will be our Sect’s asset?” The crowd gazed at the unconscious Luo Tian, stunned.

If it were an elder speaking, they might not believe it. But these words came from the Sect’s foundation—this demanded reflection.

“Sect Leader, let me take Luo Tian!” Jiang Nanxuan’s calm voice rang out. He stepped forward in white robes, with Meng Yao, Leng Qiuchan, and Zheng Xin following.

When Leng Qiuchan saw Luo Tian unconscious and pale, her face turned cold. She scanned the Nascent Soul elders before approaching Cold Hongcai to take Luo Tian.

Zheng Xin didn’t delay, knowing Leng Qiuchan’s delicacy. She stepped forward to carry Luo Tian, while Meng Yao took Long Baobao.

Feeling someone hold him, Long Baobao’s eyelids fluttered open, gazing at Meng Yao.

“Hah…” Long Baobao acted as if nothing had happened, yawned, and struggled out of Meng Yao’s arms. The crowd gaped in shock.

“This…!”
“How long has it been? This kid’s already recovered?” The disciples’ mouths twitched, marveling at the boy’s resilience.

Not only disciples, but elders too stared in awe—they’d known the boy was special, but this was beyond belief.

“Today’s grudge I’ll remember for Luo Tian. He’ll repay it soon!” Leng Qiuchan’s cold voice echoed, walking with Zheng Xin toward Jiang Nanxuan.

“Hmph. Elders, you’ve offended the wrong person. For a mere Sect Leader position, you resorted to such tricks. Hmph—wait and see when you regret it!” Jiang Nanxuan’s calm gaze swept over the elders.

“You think you’re something? Daring to speak like that!” One elder, seeing Jiang Nanxuan without cultivation, exploded in anger.

“Smack…” Before the elder could speak, a crisp slap echoed. A white-clad figure appeared before them.

“What did you say?” Her voice was calm, devoid of anger.

“Meng Yao! You!” The elder’s face turned crimson.

Chapter 394: Calmness

“Why? Is there something wrong?” Meng Yao’s calm voice echoed, as if she’d just swatted a fly.

“You dare hit me?” The elder’s face reddened, staring at Meng Yao.

Meng Yao’s identity was no secret in the Spirit-Embracing Sect—everyone knew she was a grandchild of a Reincarnation Realm elder. The three elders who had just left treated her like their own granddaughter, so the elders dared not touch her.

“Meng Yao, you’ve advanced to Nascent Soul Realm mid-level? What’s that thing in your body?” Cold Hongcai’s face showed shock, staring at Meng Yao’s youthful features.

As Cold Hongcai spoke, all eyes turned to the serene woman. They inhaled sharply.

Today’s shocks were immense—first, Long Baobao survived a Nascent Soul Realm early-level attack; then Luo Tian killed an early Nascent Soul elder. That was already astonishing.

But now, Luo Tian had attacked the senior master, drawing Reincarnation Realm elders to save him. Then, Meng Yao and Jiang Nanxuan emerged from the bamboo forest, with Meng Yao slapping an early Nascent Soul elder. This string of events left the crowd’s fragile hearts overwhelmed.

“Let me catch my breath!” A Bone-Subjugation Realm early-level disciple clutched his chest, sighing.

“How old is Meng Yao? She’s definitely under thirty. How did she reach Nascent Soul Realm mid-level?” The crowd was speechless, wanting to collapse.

The elders’ faces were equally grim. Today’s humiliation had been complete—early Nascent Soul elder dead, senior master’s face punched by Luo Tian, and now an early Nascent Soul elder slapped by Meng Yao. The elders, who had always held superiority in the sect, struggled to accept this.

All eyes stared at Meng Yao, who stood calmly. If looks could kill, she’d have died countless times.

“Hmph!” Cold Hongcai saw the elders’ eager expressions and sneered, his aura pressing against them.

The elders’ faces turned pale instantly. Seeing Cold Hongcai’s gaze, they lowered their heads—knowing he was in a rage. Who dared speak would become the three designated targets.

“Hmph. If there’s nothing, we’ll leave!” Meng Yao spoke calmly, her gaze level with the elder.

“N-nothing…” The elder’s words were forced from his teeth, his eyes filled with resentment.

“Smack!” Before the elder’s words ended, a long staff struck down, instantly reducing him to bloody flesh.

“Hmph!” Cold Hongcai’s single strike killed the Nascent Soul elder, his anger slightly eased. He swept his gaze over the elders.

“Ever since I’ve been too lenient with you, giving you power until you dared block me. I never expected your arrogance to reach this!” Cold Hongcai sneered, scanning each elder.

“Hiss…” The Spirit-Embracing Sect disciples gazed at the Nascent Soul elder’s corpse, then at Cold Hongcai—awe in their eyes.

Cold Hongcai had always been seen as gentle, but today’s behavior was unrecognizable.

Including the early Nascent Soul elder killed by Luo Tian, two Nascent Soul Realm elders had died today.

Nascent Soul Realm masters were the pinnacle of power on Tianyuan Continent. Today, the Spirit-Embracing Sect had lost two.

The disciples’ gazes fell on Zheng Xin’s back, where the unconscious youth lay—this young man had caused two Nascent Soul elders’ deaths.

The young disciples gazed at Luo Tian with reverence and admiration, solidifying his position as the Sect’s young master in their hearts.

“Nothing more. Dismiss!” Cold Hongcai sneered, striding toward his residence.

All elders, including the senior master, trembled as they watched Cold Hongcai leave, sweat trickling down their faces.

Under the disciples’ mocking glances, the elders carried the two bloody corpses of early Nascent Soul elders away, their gazes dark as they watched Cold Hongcai vanish.

…

In the bamboo forest courtyard, after East Bo Yusi’s group planted crops, Jiang Nanxuan had used some means to revive the bamboo.

Zheng Xin placed Luo Tian on a bamboo bed, worry etched on her face as she turned to Jiang Nanxuan: “Jiang Xiong, look at Luo Tian’s injuries!”

“Nothing serious. He’s just exhausted. His external wounds will heal in a few days,” Jiang Nanxuan smiled.

Hearing this, Leng Qiuchan’s worried gaze eased. She wet a towel and carefully wiped Luo Tian’s bloodied face.

Seeing this, everyone tactfully left.

“Zheng Xin, come back…” After wiping Luo Tian’s face, Leng Qiuchan called.

“What’s wrong, Qiuchan sister? I’ll go out and not bother…” Zheng Xin started to speak but was silenced by a damp towel shoved into her mouth.

“Leave the rest to you. I… can’t.” Leng Qiuchan’s rare blush made her leave.

Leng Qiuchan’s expression stunned Zheng Xin, who forgot to remove the towel from her mouth.

“Hurry! After finishing, give him a pill to speed his recovery!” Leng Qiuchan’s words snapped Zheng Xin back.

“Spit… spit…” Zheng Xin spat repeatedly, watching Leng Qiuchan leave.

“Alas… Luo Tian, you’ve been so bold today. What did I do to deserve this? Why am I stuck serving you?” Zheng Xin muttered, beginning to wipe Luo Tian’s body.

Luo Tian remained silent, his face expressionless.

Chapter 395: Calmness

In the bamboo forest courtyard, Leng Qiuchan and others sipped tea leisurely. Long Baobao darted like a cheerful butterfly, chasing Qinglin Snake and parrots around the courtyard.

Leng Qiuchan, Jiang Nanxuan, and Meng Yao wore gentle smiles. Three days had passed since Luo Tian’s coma. His condition improved steadily—external wounds fully healed, his face rosy.

“Jiang Nanxuan elder, it’s the third day now. Why hasn’t Luo Tian recovered yet?” Leng Qiuchan asked, concern in her voice.

“Qiuchan sister, don’t say that—three days isn’t enough for Luo Tian to recover from this injury. I’ll tell you, Qiuchan sister…” Zheng Xin interjected with tea.

“Get lost…” Leng Qiuchan kicked Zheng Xin, sending her to the door of Luo Tian’s bamboo hut.

“Take Luo Tian out so he can get some fresh air!” Leng Qiuchan ordered Zheng Xin.

Zheng Xin’s face showed委屈, muttering: “Why me? What did I do to deserve this?”

Though reluctant, Zheng Xin walked toward the bamboo hut. Jiang Nanxuan and Meng Yao smiled—this quiet bamboo forest had gained joy with Zheng Xin, Leng Qiuchan, and Long Baobao.

Luo Tian felt as if he’d had a long dream—dreaming of traveling to Yumen Mountain, rescuing Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei, annihilating the Tianshi Sect across Tianyuan Continent, and living the life he desired.
