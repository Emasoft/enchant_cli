“Dongping Continent!” Jiang Sxi gazed toward the distant Dongping Continent, her eyes filled with nostalgia. She had no intention of fleeing there; she knew that even if she reached it, she would have no chance of survival. Instead, it would bring endless calamities to the continent. Behind her, Ke Xinshui was furious—after his death, he might even destroy the Dongping Continent in retaliation.

“I'm sorry,” Jiang Sxi softly caressed her abdomen, a gentle expression crossing her face. Her mind drifted to a man.

“Peng…” A thunderous sound echoed behind Jiang Sxi as a folding fan transformed into a streak of blue light, materializing at her back.

Ke Xinshui’s face darkened. With his hands forming seals, the fan unfurled, unleashing waves of oceanic fury toward Jiang Sxi, who was already struggling to hold on.

At the same time, other Supreme Rank cultivators accompanying Ke Xinshui also bore murderous intent. Their hands formed seals continuously, and various martial techniques manifested around the slowing Jiang Sxi.

The Zhu Que Sect’s people were also enraged. The thought of Ke Xindie’s death and Ke Zhentian’s inevitable fury weighed heavily on them. To have their sect’s territory attacked by an outsider and then let Jiang Sxi escape would be a disgrace. They would also face Ke Zhentian’s wrath.

All of them unleashed their ultimate techniques, directing devastating blows toward Jiang Sxi. A powerful storm formed, shaking the void and shattering countless stars as it crushed toward her.

“Impossible to withstand!” Jiang Sxi let out a bitter laugh. Though she longed to evade, her body was too weak. If she were at her peak, she might have risked injury to block their combined attack. But now, with her strength waning, she could not withstand the assault of so many.

“Fighting a woman like this—how shameless!” Just as Jiang Sxi prepared to accept death, a cold voice echoed through the stars. A figure instantly appeared before her.

Hearing this voice, Jiang Sxi’s face lit up with a smile. She silently mused that the saying about seeing one's thoughts before death was true.

But then, a warm embrace left her stunned. The familiar warmth made her doubt if this was merely a dream.

“Damn it… why are you here? Run!” Jiang Sxi’s face changed completely. She gazed at the cold face before her, shouting in fury.

Luo Tian—her eternal adversary. His presence now was infuriating to Jiang Sxi, who believed he would be a fool for confronting so many. Yet she knew it was futile to protest, as their attacks had already reached them.

“Fine! Let us die together. In the cycle of rebirth, at least we’ll have each other. If there’s a next life, I’ll marry you!” Jiang Sxi gazed at Luo Tian with tenderness, clutching him tightly as she whispered.

“Don’t worry. I’m here,” Luo Tian smiled gently, comforting her while turning his back to the terrifying storm.

“Peng… peng…” The storm crashed onto Luo Tian’s back, even causing him a slight numbness.

“This time you’re done!” Ke Xinshui’s face twisted with hatred. His anger had not faded despite Jiang Sxi’s death.

Dragons have a forbidden scale; those who touch it perish. For Ke Xinshui, his forbidden scale was his younger sister, Ke Xindie. To him, even ten Jiang Sxis dying could not erase the pain of her death.

The storm faded. Ke Xinshui stared at the stars ahead, his face suddenly changing: “Luo Tian!”

“Luo Tian!” Jiang Sxi’s expression was one of disbelief. She had accepted death, but in an instant, she realized she was still cradled in that warm embrace. Her face flushed with a hint of red.

Luo Tian gently placed Jiang Sxi down, noting her poor condition. His face darkened further as he poured his Primordial Chaos Origin into her body to heal her wounds.

“Ke Xinshui, it was a mistake to let you live,” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed through the stars as he tended to Jiang Sxi.

“Luo Tian, I advise you not to interfere. Jiang Sxi killed my sister first. If you don’t want trouble, I suggest you hand her over to me,” Ke Xinsu spoke without fear, for he stood behind the entire Zhu Que Sect.

“Oh? You mean Ke Xindie was killed by her?” Luo Tian’s lips curled into a smile, as if it were trivial. He was curious why Jiang Sxi had risked her life to kill Ke Xindie.

Seeing Luo Tian’s gaze on her, Jiang Sxi’s face flushed briefly. She coldly addressed Ke Xinshui: “Your sister deserved it. She schemed against me first; otherwise, do you think I’d waste my time killing your useless sister?”

Luo Tian had only searched Ding Sitong’s soul and was unaware of Ke Xindie’s scheme against Jiang Sxi. Now, hearing Jiang Sxi say Ke Xindie had schemed against her, and seeing the faint redness on her face, he deduced what she meant. If Jiang Sxi hadn’t been enraged to the point of desperation, she wouldn’t have foolishly killed Ke Xindie and offended the entire Zhu Que Sect.

“She deserved it,” Luo Tian awkwardly rubbed his nose, addressing Ke Xinshui.

“Not only your sister deserved it. All of you deserve death. Since you value her so much, I’ll grant your wish—join her in the cycle of rebirth!” Luo Tian’s voice carried coldness.

After all, he had already made a pact with the Zhu Que Sect. He wasn’t afraid of killing them now, especially since he had already slain several Supreme Rank masters from the Zhu Que Sect outside the Feng Shen Continent. Plus, Jiang Sxi had nearly died at their hands, inciting his fury.

To Luo Tian, Jiang Sxi was already his. Ke Xinshui had a forbidden scale; so did he. His forbidden scale was his loved ones and family. To him, these people were already corpses.

Before Ke Xinshui could protest, Luo Tian vanished from his spot and appeared before a Four-source Supreme Rank cultivator in an instant, delivering a punch.

“You…” Ke Xinshui roared with fury but was speechless in the next moment.

“Peng…” In that brief hesitation, the Four-source Supreme Rank cultivator was reduced to a mist of blood before their eyes.

“Seven-source Heavenly Supreme!” Ke Xinshui’s eyes widened in disbelief, his voice trembling. He hadn’t noticed Luo Tian’s cultivation level before but now felt it clearly—his mind was in turmoil.

But before Ke Xinshui could protest again, Luo Tian moved like a tiger among sheep. His spatial origin凝聚 (concentrated), ruthlessly harvesting the lives of those Ke Xinshui had brought.

Even a Six-source Heavenly Supreme was instantly slain by Luo Tian. How much more so for those accompanying Ke Xinshui?

In an instant, countless fragments of flesh and corpses floated in the stars. Only Ke Xinshui remained.

“Did you really think I could reach Seven-source Heavenly Supreme so quickly?” Jiang Sxi’s face showed surprise. She had thought herself the top genius of the Four Saints Continent, but Luo Tian was even more terrifying. In such a short time, he had surpassed her to reach Seven-source. Though she hadn’t trained much recently, his speed was terrifying.

“Just some opportunities,” Luo Tian said with a playful tone. He turned to Ke Xinshui, who stood frozen.

Ke Xinshui was like a deflated balloon. He knew he could never match Luo Tian, even if he burned his origin. His current level was Five-source Earth Supreme—like comparing heaven and earth.

Jiang Sxi, a Six-source Heavenly Supreme, had already killed them all. How could Ke Xinshui possibly resist Luo Tian, a Seven-source Heavenly Supreme?

“Any last words?” Luo Tian sighed softly, gazing at Ke Xinshui with complex emotions.

He somewhat approved of Ke Xinshui’s character, but his one flaw was his excessive indulgence toward his arrogant younger sister. That had cost him his life.

Luo Tian didn’t intend to let Ke Xinshui live. He knew that with Ke Xinshui’s obsession over his sister, he would never abandon his hatred toward Jiang Sxi. Though Jiang Sxi didn’t fear Ke Xinshui, the presence of hatred was unacceptable. The best way to end someone’s hatred was to erase them.

“Nothing to say. I never thought I’d die by your hand,” Ke Xinshui, a man of integrity, smiled as he spoke. There was even relief in his voice.

“Take your own life. I’ll grant you a dignified death,” Luo Tian said, showing respect for Ke Xinshui.

“Suicide? I never thought I’d die this way!” Ke Xinshui laughed, raising his hand to strike himself on the head.

A thunderous sound echoed. Cracking noises filled the air as Ke Xinshui floated in space, three soul fragments escaping his body.

“Rebirth!” Luo Tian punched forward, summoning a vast rebirth passage before him. As it pulled with immense force, his rebirth origin emerged from his dantian, enveloping Ke Xinshui’s three soul fragments and sending them into the passage.

“Hope you don’t meet such a sister in your next life,” Luo Tian sighed, addressing Jiang Sxi behind him. “It’s done. Let’s go!”

Luo Tian didn’t hesitate, dragging Jiang Sxi into the Dongping Continent despite her struggles.

“Welcome back, Senior Sister Jiang!” The Qing Long Sect’s disciples greeted with reverence as Luo Tian led Jiang Sxi into the Dongping Continent, returning to the luxurious room where he had once lived.

As soon as they entered, Luo Tian felt a warmth. The room was clean and orderly—evidently Jiang Sxi had kept it tidy during his absence.

Jiang Sxi felt awkward, especially when she saw the luxurious bed. Her face turned a deep red, spreading down her neck.

Even with his strong willpower, Luo Tian swallowed hard and whispered, “If you don’t want to stay here, I’ll leave tomorrow.”

Seeing Luo Tian’s demeanor, Jiang Sxi felt a flicker of pride. But when he spoke, her face turned cold. “Tell me about your past!”

“Uh…” Hearing Jiang Sxi hadn’t asked him to leave, Luo Tian’s eyes lit up. This meant she wasn’t as repulsed by him as he had imagined.

“Past…” But upon hearing Jiang Sxi’s question, Luo Tian’s face turned sorrowful. He spoke softly about his past.

They sat there, one speaking and the other listening as if they were strangers. Luo Tian’s voice trembled with emotion, recalling his parents, relatives, friends, and mentors—those who had sacrificed their lives for the Tianyuan Continent. He finally couldn’t hold back and burst into tears.

Since leaving the Tianyuan Continent, Luo Tian had been tense. He hadn’t allowed himself to relax. He knew he couldn’t afford it in the Four Saints Continent, where he was alone. Now that Jiang Sxi had become his ally, he felt no need to guard against her. He let out a flood of emotions, hugging Jiang Sxi and crying like a child.

“Someday, you’ll return,” Jiang Sxi gently patted Luo Tian’s back, her face also showing sorrow as she comforted him.

“Huh…” Luo Tian took a deep breath, feeling his spirit and energy restored. He hadn’t cried like this since childhood—his face turned red, and he looked at Jiang Sxi. He noticed her chest was soaked, making him doubt if she had allowed him to lie there.

“Sorry,” Luo Tian whispered, gazing at Jiang Sxi with embarrassment.

“It’s fine…” Seeing Luo Tian looking at her chest, Jiang Sxi glared at him. Her qi fluctuated, drying the tears on her chest.

“Let’s talk about something important. What are your plans now?” Jiang Sxi asked, as they had offended the Zhu Que Sect by killing Ke Xindie and Ke Xinshui.

“Don’t worry. The Zhu Que Sect won’t dare to trouble us now. What we need to do is expand our forces. I’ll make the Dongping Continent become the fifth major sect of the Zhu Que Sect!”

“From today on, let’s call it Tianyuan Sect!” Luo Tian said confidently, seeking Jiang Sxi’s opinion.

“Okay. Whatever you decide,” Jiang Sxi nodded gently. She had slipped into a small woman’s role, no longer the domineering figure she once was.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian smiled, flicking his finger. A streak of red flame appeared on his fingertip. As the flame emerged, the room’s temperature became unusually dry. A series of phoenix cries echoed through the luxurious room.

“Zhu Que Ancestral Flame!” Jiang Sxi’s eyes widened in amazement, gazing at the flame in Luo Tian’s hand. This was the Zhu Que Ancestral Flame, discovered by Luo Tian after Ke Xinshui’s self-destruction.

Now, he took it and offered it to Jiang Sxi. “The rest is up to me. For now, you need to strengthen your power. This Zhu Que Ancestral Flame is the sect’s treasure. Once you refine it, your combat power will improve significantly.”

Seeing Luo Tian’s calm demeanor, Jiang Sxi smiled. She didn’t hesitate to accept the flame.

“I need to go to the Qing Long Sect again. For now, be careful. You’re only Four-source Supreme—restoring to Six-source will take a long time. Don’t let yourself be tricked again like before,” Luo Tian said with a light smile, addressing Jiang Sxi.

“Go away…” Jiang Sxi playfully glared at Luo Tian and kicked him out of the door.

“Peng…” Luo Tian landed on the ground awkwardly, a smile on his face. He lightly brushed off the dust from his clothes and pushed off the ground, vanishing into the distance.

……

The Dongping Continent wasn’t far from the Qing Long Sect. With Luo Tian’s current speed, it took only two days to reach the Qing Long Continent.

Flying over the Qing Long Continent, Luo Tian felt a deep admiration. It was the first continent he had arrived at when he first entered the Four Saints Continent. Now, seeing it again filled him with a different sentiment.

Luo Tian smiled as he gazed at the massive gates of the Qing Long Sect. He stepped into the gates.

The gatekeepers naturally recognized Luo Tian. His name was well-known throughout the Qing Long Sect.

“Respect for the First Sect Master!” Two gatekeepers bowed respectfully, addressing Luo Tian. At this moment, the Qing Long Sect’s disciples didn’t know that Luo Tian had regained his original identity. They regarded him as the Qing Long Sect’s First Sect Master.

Luo Tian nodded gently, a warm smile on his face. He flew into the sky of the Qing Long Sect and spoke aloud.

“Master Sha, I’m here!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed like thunder, causing the Qing Long Sect to stir instantly.

“Is it the First Sect Master?” The disciples and elders of the Qing Long Sect looked in astonishment at Luo Tian, now restored to Seven-source Supreme.

“Summon all the disciples of the Qing Long Sect immediately!” Sha Cangmang appeared before Luo Tian, his face dark with anger as he ordered a senior elder.

“Master Sha truly keeps his word,” Luo Tian nodded gently, bowing to Sha Cangmang.

“Hmph. I’ll gather them for you. Whether they follow you or not depends on your ability. After all, legs are attached to their bodies,” Sha Cangmang glared at Luo Tian.

“Master Sha, don’t worry. I won’t force anyone,” Luo Tian smiled, ignoring Sha Cangmang’s words.

Soon, over a million Qing Long Sect disciples gathered under Luo Tian’s expectant gaze. All wore the same symbol, the Binding Soul Band.

……

Chapter 802: The Formation of a Power Base

On the Qing Long Sect’s plaza in the Feng Shen Continent, Luo Tian stood in the sky. Sha Cangmang and other Qing Long Sect elders stood behind him, their eyes filled with hostility. If not for the blood oath binding them, they would have attacked Luo Tian immediately.

But even Sha Cangmang and the other Seven-source and Eight-source Heavenly Supremes dared not act. Blood oaths were no joke—they functioned like the rules of the Four Saints Continent and would be fulfilled.

Luo Tian smiled, ignoring the hostile glances from Sha Cangmang and others. His gaze swept over the nearly one million disciples wearing Binding Soul Bands, forming a golden sea that illuminated the sky.

These disciples stood at the perimeter of the crowd. The Qing Long Sect’s disciples looked puzzled, unsure what their First Sect Master and current sect master were up to.

The disciples also felt confused, gazing at Luo Tian with a gentle expression.

Luo Tian held an irreplaceable position in their hearts. But they knew this man was no longer the Luo Tian they revered but the Qing Long Sect’s First Sect Master.

“Good day, I suppose you think I am the Qing Long Sect’s First Sect Master. You may have some resentment toward me,” Luo Tian said, his voice not loud but echoing in everyone’s minds.

The disciples stood there silently. A heavy atmosphere filled the crowd, clearly agreeing with Luo Tian’s words. They gazed at him expectantly.

“I’ll tell you today I am not the Qing Long Sect’s First Sect Master. I am truly Luo Tian!” Luo Tian spoke again, his voice like thunder that echoed through the world.

Thunderous shock rippled through the crowd. The Qing Long Sect’s people were stunned, their faces filled with disbelief as they gazed at Luo Tian standing proudly in the sky.

“Impossible! How could Luo Tian, who was possessed by the First Sect Master, still be alive!”
“Right! The First Sect Master must be deceiving us. He wants us to do something!” Their faces showed disbelief, their gazes filled with hostility toward Luo Tian.

In their hearts, Luo Tian was already dead. The First Sect Master had possessed him. They wouldn’t allow the First Sect Master to use Luo Tian’s identity to live on, humiliating him and using him.

The Qing Long Sect’s disciples also looked stunned. How could the First Sect Master, a powerful being who had dominated the Four Saints Continent and founded the Qing Long Sect, fail to succeed in his possession? With Sha Cangmang’s help, it should have been successful.

“I suppose you’ll ask how I could survive the First Sect Master’s possession. But it is true, and Sha Cangmang and other elders who entered the Feng Shen Continent can testify!” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Sha Cangmang and others.

“And I’ve come today to free you from the Binding Soul Bands. Those who wish to follow me can leave with me, for I’ve decided to break away from the Qing Long Sect!” Luo Tian spoke clearly, emphasizing the words “break away from the Qing Long Sect.”

Silence. The Qing Long Sect fell into silence as Luo Tian’s words ended. Sha Cangmang and others stood there with dark faces, neither confirming nor denying Luo Tian’s words. Their silence implied the answer.

After a brief silence, heavy breathing filled the air as disciples scanned Luo Tian and Sha Cangmang. They were considering the truth of Luo Tian’s words.

“I can testify that this person, my master, is truly Luo Tian!” A woman’s voice echoed suddenly. Her perfect figure flew into the air and stood before Luo Tian.

“That is Jiang Yimeng, a former subordinate of the First Sect Master! She must have become a furnace. Don’t trust her!” The disciples looked confused, whispering among themselves.

“I can also confirm that this person is truly Luo Tian… I can also confirm…” One by one, disciples stepped forward from the crowd. These were the few who had been helped by Luo Tian in the Feng Shen Continent.

As these disciples stepped forward, the crowd began to believe in Luo Tian’s truth. These disciples held some fame within the Qing Long Sect, otherwise they wouldn’t have been chosen to enter the Feng Shen Continent.

“If you still don’t believe me, I’ll swear a blood oath today! If any word is false, may I be destroyed completely!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed again in the minds of all Qing Long Sect disciples.

At the same time, Luo Tian extended his hand. A drop of blood flew from his fingertip, forming a strange symbol that imprinted itself on his forehead. A strange fluctuation spread from Luo Tian’s body, and people knew it was the fluctuation of a blood oath.

“Nothing wrong!” The disciples saw Luo Tian still standing in the sky, his face calm. They finally believed him.

Sha Cangmang’s silence, the testimonies of several disciples, and Luo Tian’s final blood oath convinced the crowd. Their faces gradually turned into fervor as they gazed at Luo Tian in the sky.

“I’ll follow you!”
“Senior Brother Luo Tian, I also wish to follow you…”
“Damn it! I’ve had enough of this slave-like life!” One by one, figures flew from the plaza and stood before Luo Tian. They surrounded him instantly.

But still, some refused to leave the Qing Long Sect. Some were too dull-witted and clung to the Qing Long Sect’s tree, unwilling to leave. Others had good relationships with their masters and stayed behind.

A massive crowd blocked the sunlight, like a dark cloud over the Qing Long Sect’s sky.

Luo Tian’s vast spiritual awareness swept over the crowd. Though some didn’t choose to follow him, nearly a million people wished to leave with him. He didn’t know their reasons, but if half of them truly followed him, he would be satisfied.

“Alright, everyone. You can wait outside the Qing Long Continent. I still need to discuss some matters with Master Sha. Once we finish, I’ll free you from the Binding Soul Bands!”
“You can be organized by Jiang Yimeng. She can represent me fully. Of course, you may choose to disobey. I’m sure you know my methods!” Luo Tian spoke, his voice echoing. He nodded to Jiang Yimeng.

Hearing the responsibility, Jiang Yimeng’s body trembled. Her face showed respect. Originally, she had led Luo Tian’s forces. Though the number was much smaller than a million, it wasn’t difficult for her.

Under the gaze of Luo Tian and Qing Long Sect disciples, a million people formed a golden sea and flew out of the Qing Long Sect toward the Qing Long Continent.

As these million people left, the Qing Long Sect’s plaza felt unusually empty. The disciples found it hard to adjust.

“Master Sha, do you remember our other agreement?” Luo Tian spoke softly, rubbing his hands together.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the elders behind Sha Cangmang twitched. They remembered when Sha Cangmang had negotiated with the other three sects, and Jin Yongsie and Ke Zhentian had demanded exorbitant prices. They nearly took all the Qing Long Sect’s resources. In the end, after much negotiation, Sha Cangmang had traded twelve continents to secure Tiger Prison Star for the Qing Long Sect.

Sha Cangmang waved his hand. Four tokens floated before him. His face darkened as he pushed the four tokens toward Luo Tian.

The Four Great Sects’ symbolic beasts—Qing Long, Bai Hu, Zhu Que, and Xuan Wu—were vividly carved on the tokens. A fluctuation spread from them. Luo Tian confirmed that these four tokens were definitely not ordinary.

“Within a month, the representatives of our four sects will withdraw. You’d better go to Tiger Prison Star within a month and complete the handover with us!”
“Also, Tiger Prison Star is the prison of the entire Four Saints Continent. It must not be compromised. The people inside…” Sha Cangmang spoke but stopped halfway, thinking of Luo Tian’s relationship with the Qing Long Sect. He sighed inwardly, letting this kid suffer some losses.

“Master Sha, you have my gratitude!” Luo Tian bowed to Sha Cangmang. He smiled and didn’t continue the conversation, vanishing into thin air.

The Qing Long Sect’s disciples watched Luo Tian become a streak of light. They exchanged glances, their faces filled with disbelief.

“Luo Tian has defected from the Qing Long Sect?” Only after Luo Tian’s departure did they fully understand. They hadn’t expected him to openly lead his disciples out of the Qing Long Sect, and even the sect master hadn’t spoken.

“Hmph… a year’s worth of blood oath. It only lasts a year. I don’t believe this kid can stir up much in a year. After that, it’ll be the Qing Long Sect’s army hunting them!” A newly promoted Eight-source Supreme Elder spoke, gazing at the direction Luo Tian had disappeared.

Others also bore murderous intent. The Qing Long Sect hadn’t been insulted so greatly in years.

“Let Jin Yongsie and Ke Zhentian play with him for a year. This kid can’t be judged by common sense. For now, it’s better to observe carefully!” Sha Cangmang sighed softly, his gaze deep.

……

Chapter 803: Tianyuan Sect

Outside the Qing Long Continent, nearly a million disciples looked worriedly at the massive Qing Long Continent. This formidable force stood in the void, their individual strength reaching up to Two-source Supreme Rank. Yet together, they created a deep sense of awe.

“Why is the Qing Long Sect doing this? Are they planning to attack another sect?” A streak of light passed by, and upon seeing these disciples were from the Qing Long Sect, they looked surprised. They took out their transmission tools to inform their sects.

After all, the Qing Long Sect was the first of the four major sects. Any movement would be noticed early, allowing other sects to prepare. For example, if the Qing Long Sect planned to destroy another sect, those sects would distance themselves early to avoid being caught in the crossfire.

Soon, people became anxious. They stood around watching developments.

“Will Senior Brother Luo Tian face any misfortune?” The disciples whispered among themselves. They hadn’t believed that Luo Tian had such a big favor with Sha Cangmang to let them leave the Qing Long Sect.

“Perhaps Master has paid a great price to free us from the old Qing Long Sect!”
“Maybe. Regardless, once we’re free of the Binding Soul Bands, I’ll follow anyone!” The disciples quickly thought about their upcoming freedom from the bands. Their faces showed excitement.

Under everyone’s expectant gaze, Luo Tian appeared as a streak of green light. The million disciples roared his name, shaking the stars.

“Luo Tian? Isn’t he the prodigy who shone in the ranking battle of the Qing Long Sect?” People around were confused.

His figure wasn’t imposing, but he was surrounded by disciples. His long hair flowed, his dark eyes like two black holes. He instantly appeared before the disciples.

With his cultivation deepening, Luo Tian’s appearance had improved. Though not particularly handsome, he was much better than before. Combined with his unique aura, he attracted everyone’s attention.

“Respect for Senior Brother Luo!” The roar echoed. All disciples looked at Luo Tian with admiration.

“Alright, everyone. I’ll free the Binding Soul Bands first. After that, those who wish to follow me can go with me. Of course, you may choose to leave on your own. I won’t stop you!” Luo Tian smiled, looking at the nearly million disciples.

After a brief show of determination, under Jiang Yimeng’s and other disciples’ organization who had been saved by Luo Tian, the disciples were quickly divided into groups of a thousand. They stood in the void waiting for Luo Tian to free their Binding Soul Bands.

“Alright, don’t worry. There’s no danger!” Luo Tian smiled and waved his hand. His origin power surged, forming symbols that appeared before the disciples.

Eight origins formed a dragon of eight colors, flying through the endless stars. Luo Tian pointed his finger, and the dragon shattered into a small snake that slithered through the stars. Finally, it climbed onto the Binding Soul Bands of a thousand disciples.

“Release!” Luo Tian shouted. He grabbed the void with both hands.

“Peng… peng…” Thunderous sounds echoed over a thousand heads. The stars seemed to be setting off fireworks, with layer upon layer of sound echoing in their ears.

“Luo Tian is freeing the Binding Soul Bands for the disciples!” People looked surprised. The Binding Soul Bands of the Qing Long Sect were known to be unbreakable. Seeing a thousand disciples’ Binding Soul Bands turn into symbols and vanish, they gaped in disbelief.

“They’re really free!” The thousand disciples looked excited. Their eyes showed gratitude toward Luo Tian, with some even crying tears of joy—how much pain had these bands caused them over the years?

“I can finally live like a normal person!” A young man shouted, his voice filled with endless excitement.

Others looked happy. Their eyes showed gratitude as they bowed to Luo Tian.

“Alright, next group!” Luo Tian waved his hand, addressing the impatient disciples.

“Zhao Tiezhu, get lost. Look at you acting so smug! Once I free my Binding Soul Band, I’ll kick your ass!”
“Who are you? Don’t act so smug. It’s just a little earlier, what’s there to be smug about?” Others urged the front group. Seeing their smugness, they couldn’t help but mock them.

This harmless quarrel was good. It promoted friendship among people. Luo Tian didn’t stop it, smiling as the next group of a thousand disciples approached him.

“One… two…” Luo Tian spent two days outside the Qing Long Continent, finally freeing nearly a million Binding Soul Bands.

“Huh…” Luo Tian took a deep breath. His face was pale, and he nearly fell down. If Jiang Yimeng hadn’t supported him, he might have collapsed.

Two days of continuous origin power consumption. Though it wasn’t as fast as burning, the terrifying exhaustion left him barely able to withstand.
