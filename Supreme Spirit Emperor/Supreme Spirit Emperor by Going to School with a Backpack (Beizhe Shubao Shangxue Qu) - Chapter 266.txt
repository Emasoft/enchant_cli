These people were powerful, but facing the attack of so many divine beings, they could not withstand it and ultimately suffered heavy injuries.

“Damn you… You really are变态, how did you survive!” Xu Liyi's face was pale, blood gushing from his orifices as if he had been struck by lightning, yet he still couldn't help cursing.

“By relying on you people? You really think we came alone? I’m the one who’s most afraid of dying!” Zheng Xin shouted at Sun Miechen.

Chapter 1127: Blood Stains the Divine and Demon Realms

Beneath the starry sky of the Divine and Demon Realms, Zheng Xin and Gu Lei stood at the head of the golden dragon, their gazes unyielding as they cursed the divine forces.

“Die!” Sun Miechen's face darkened, seeing that these ten or so people still dared to act so boldly. He barked at his divine disciples behind him.

“Boom…!” As soon as Sun Miechen's words finished, a thunderous roar echoed from afar. Glittering light flashed, and the vast starry sky was overturned like a flood, sweeping into the hearts of all present.

“What is this!” Luo Tian's face was weak as he stood there, his expression filled with shock before he shook his head bitterly.

The familiar aura left no doubt in Luo Tian's mind—he knew exactly who had caused this thunderous sound.

“Luo Tian!” A deep voice rang out, and a series of familiar faces appeared in Luo Tian's vision.

“Kid, such a big event happened and you didn’t tell us!” Luo Xiong stood at the front of the group, scolding Luo Tian.

“Indeed! Do you want us to send our old people to meet their end?” Luo Nantian stood with his sword, beside Zhang Qiuyue who wore a look of concern. The two seemed like celestial lovers.

“Luo Tian!” Gu Qianxue, Leng Qiuchan, and Jiang Sixi looked at Luo Tian with reproach, rushing to his side.

“Luo Tian, it's always been you who protected us. Now it's our turn to protect you!” A chorus of voices echoed, their gazes turned upward.

“Everyone has come…” Luo Tian felt touched as he looked at the familiar faces—Zhang Ziping and others stood among the crowd.

At the same time, Luo Tian felt a pang of guilt. This was his own matter; he had chosen to come alone to the Divine and Demon Realms without wanting the people of the Four Sacred Star Domains to help. He didn’t want the Four Sacred Star Domains, which had just begun to recover, to be devastated by the divine clan and possibly wiped out entirely.

“Four Sacred Star Domains!” Sun Miechen's face darkened as he saw these figures. If before they had looked down on the Four Sacred Star Domains, now they realized that over the years, the Four Sacred Star Domains had truly grown and possessed an undeniable strength.

“Fight! What does it matter if the blood stains the Divine and Demon Realms!” Luo Xiong roared, his voice filled with fierce battle spirit. He took the lead and charged toward the divine army.

“Sun Shengtian! It seems our fate isn’t over yet!” Diao Yuanshan laughed, knowing that even if they couldn't defeat their enemies, they could escape calmly. His hands continuously unleashed powerful blows toward Sun Shengtian and the others.

“Damn!” Sun Shengtian's face darkened, surprised that things had changed again at this point.

“Fight!” The battle spirit spread as the Four Sacred Star Domains faced the top clans of the Nine Realms, outnumbered by two or three times. Yet they showed no fear, their battle spirit reaching the heavens as they followed Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian into battle.

“Zhan Biao, Yan Jun, take Luo Tian and leave first! He's not fit to fight now. His safety is entrusted to the two of you!” Xu Liyi addressed Chen Zhanbiao, his voice heavy with concern.

“Got it!” Chen Zhanbiao and Yan Jun nodded in agreement. Chen Zhanbiao lifted Luo Tian onto his back and flew toward the distance.

“Let me go! I can't run away like this!” Luo Tian's face was pale. How could he abandon his people?

“Kid, don’t be foolish! Their target is you. Besides, are you still strong enough? Go, remember that the foundation of the Four Sacred Star Domains is you. As long as you don’t die, the Four Sacred Star Domains and Tianyuan Continent won't be destroyed!” Luo Nantian smiled slightly, patting Luo Tian's shoulder.

“Don’t worry; we’ll be fine. Once you’re far away, we'll retreat completely!” Wan Lingkong reassured Luo Tian by patting his chest.

“Go! Don’t let their blood be in vain!” The crowd shouted at Luo Tian, pointing to the Four Sacred Star Domains fighting with the divine clan.

“I'm sorry!” Luo Tian's eyes moistened as he watched the battlefield where people died every moment, his heart aching deeply.

This was his own matter, yet so many had died because of it. Luo Tian's heart ached to the core, his breaths heavy.

“Hurry up! To reduce deaths, hurry!” People shouted at Luo Tian, urging him to leave.

“Go!” Chen Zhanbiao roared, lifting Luo Tian and flying toward the demon clan like a monstrous beast.

“Is it worth it?” Luo Tian's eyes were lifeless, his gaze dimmed with guilt. He wanted to break free from Chen Zhanbiao's grip but couldn't, his body too weak.

“Was it任性? Was I being too selfish?” Luo Tian felt bitter, but he knew that even if given another chance, he would still do the same.

Luo Tian had always followed his heart without regret, but this time he felt guilty. Though the people of the Four Sacred Star Domains had volunteered to block the divine clan, Luo Tian couldn't get over the guilt. They were people with parents, brothers, and wives; if one of them died, Luo Tian would never forgive himself. A sense of helplessness surged again in his heart.

“Big brother, don’t be sad. Rest assured, they’ll be fine. Wherever you go, it’s about strength. The Four Sacred Star Domains aren’t weak! They’ll all return safely!” Yan Jun, sensing Luo Tian's bitterness, comforted him gently.

“Strength!” Luo Tian whispered lowly, his eyes gradually brightening as he gazed at the bloodstained battlefield and clenched his fists.

“If I had strength, if I could face a sacred domain alone, perhaps the outcome today wouldn’t be this! If I were the Master of an Era, who would dare to harm my loved ones!” Luo Tian sighed deeply.

Originally, after entering the Sage Realm, Luo Tian had no longer craved strength so much; he longed for a carefree life with family and friends.

But Luo Tian knew he was wrong, because what he desired required strong strength to protect. Without it, he couldn’t live the life he wanted.

“Strength!” Luo Tian's eyes sparkled with determination, once again yearning for immense power.

Chen Zhanbiao and Yan Jun carried Luo Tian away from the battlefield, flying toward the distance without pause. They appeared at the entrance of the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave.

“I wonder how Jiang Xiong is doing…” Luo Tian sighed deeply, gazing at the black and white qi swirling around the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave.

“I’ll find you again once I’m strong enough, Jiang Xiong! But I hope you break out of the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave on your own!” Luo Tian spoke softly.

“Kid, you have no chance now!” As soon as Luo Tian's words finished, a powerful pressure instantly enveloped the three of them.

“Who!” Chen Zhanbiao shouted, his voice like a thunderclap, eyes cautious as he stared into the void.

“Haha, don’t be afraid; I won’t harm you! I love talented people like you!” A voice echoed, and a red-clothed figure gradually appeared in their line of sight.

Luo Tian's heart shuddered; he suddenly remembered the person who had blocked him and Diao Yuanshan earlier, whose obstruction had allowed the divine clan to surround them again, missing their chance to escape.

A powerful aura radiated from the red-clothed figure, and a woman with revealing attire appeared before them. Her presence exuded an uncomfortable aura to Luo Tian.

“Half-step Era!” Luo Tian's eyes widened, staring at the woman with revealing attire, his heart shaking.

Her appearance was ordinary, but she radiated an ancient aura that didn’t match her looks—clearly a long-lived demon.

“Who are you? Why do you want to kill us!” Luo Tian steadied his mind, gazing at the woman.

“Who am I? Haha, of course, I’m your enemy! My son died at your hands. Today, I’ll let you experience what it means to wish for life but be denied!” The woman smiled, raising her hand. A pink light instantly filled the starry sky, surrounding Luo Tian and the two others.

“Don’t worry; I’ll let you die happily. I also need your strong, young vitality!” The woman smiled, her eyes full of seduction, making Luo Tian feel nauseated.

“You…” The pink aura instantly surrounded the three of them. Faced with the pressure of a Half-Step Era, they couldn’t resist and could only let the pink aura enter their bodies.

“Smells so good…” Chen Zhanbiao and Yan Jun's eyes became dazed, standing motionless under the starry sky.

Luo Tian’s mind also felt hazy; the red-clothed figure seemed to blur, as if he had fallen into an illusion.

“Am I beautiful?” The seductive voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, and the red-clothed woman transformed into Gu Qianxue's image. There was no flaw to be found.

“No! She’s not Qianxue!” Luo Tian whispered, forcing himself to activate the Purple Extreme Demon Eye and look into the distance.

Unlike Luo Tian, Chen Zhanbiao and Yan Jun wore expressions of obsession, slowly approaching the red-clothed woman.

“Zhanbiao! Yan Jun!” Luo Tian shouted, but he couldn’t make a sound. He wanted to stop them but couldn’t move.

“Don’t resist, even masters of the later Era would be affected. You can't break free!” The seductive woman said, strange fragrance entering Luo Tian’s nose. His arms began to pulse with strange waves, and strange marks flickered continuously.

“This is…” Luo Tian felt the pulses on his arms and suddenly remembered the monster he had encountered before.

Chapter 1128: The Melody of a Zither

Outside the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave, Luo Tian grimaced at his arms. The strange marks flickered in and out of existence, strange energy filling his body, causing his face to flush.

“Kid, this is the Harmonizing Mark left by my son on you. When activated, it's stronger than any aphrodisiac in the world. Don’t resist; even masters of the later Era would be affected. You can't break free!” The seductive woman smiled, speaking softly.

“Damn it! So the monster who was waiting by the wall for a red apricot was your son. You’re Mao Qiulian!” Luo Tian couldn’t bear to think further, staring at Mao Qiulian. He began to feel nauseous.

As Luo Tian was lost in thought, Yan Jun and Chen Zhanbiao had already approached Mao Qiulian. They extended their hands toward her丰满 body.

“Zhanbiao! Yan Jun!” Luo Tian shouted at them, his voice filled with urgency.

“Haha, don’t rush! You’ll be like them soon and come to me willingly!” Mao Qiulian smiled, her voice sounding ethereal in Luo Tian’s ears.

“Luo Tian…” The seductive voice echoed, and as the Harmonizing Mark took effect, Mao Qiulian transformed into Gu Qianxue’s image. Not only Gu Qianxue, but also Leng Qiuchan, Jiang Sixi, and Sun Mengru’s figures appeared around Luo Tian, naked and rotating around him.

Luo Tian's willpower was strong, but the Harmonizing Mark’s effect combined with his previous battles left his resolve at its lowest. Soon, he fell into the trap.

“Haha, I thought you could hold out longer, but it seems you lack willpower too!” Mao Qiulian pushed away Yan Jun and Chen Zhanbiao’s hands roaming over her body, stepping toward Luo Tian. She placed her hand on his chest and wore a look of ecstasy.

“Indeed, the reincarnation body is strong! Compared to ordinary divine sons, it's much stronger!” Mao Qiulian tore open Luo Tian’s clothes, revealing his fit upper body.

At this moment, Mao Qiulian appeared as Gu Qianxue to Luo Tian, who had no defenses. Luo Tian reached out to embrace her, groaning lowly.

“Ping…” Just as Luo Tian was about to lose control, a clear zither melody echoed in the starry sky, instantly entering the ears of Luo Tian and Yan Jun and Chen Zhanbiao. Their red faces regained a bit of clarity.

“No!” Regaining some clarity, Luo Tian stopped his hand on Mao Qiulian’s face and shouted loudly.

“Who!” Mao Qiulian shouted, no longer seductive but instead quickly putting her clothes back on. She gazed at the distance.

“Hum…” The humming echoed, and the black and white qi within the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave slowly rolled like tides.

But no one spoke, only the zither melody rang out again in the starry sky, like flowing water. A quiet and solemn atmosphere spread across the stars, and the black and white qi also roared with the zither melody.

Mao Qiulian furrowed her brows, gazing at the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave. She naturally knew its danger.

The zither melody continued; with each note, Luo Tian and the others regained clarity, their eyes becoming clearer. The strange marks on Luo Tian’s arms seemed to be suppressed by something, vanishing under the zither melody.

“Fooling around! You dare not show yourself? Even if you restore them, they still can't escape my grasp!” Mao Qiulian sneered, raising her hand toward Luo Tian.

“Hum…” The zither melody ended, and Luo Tian fully regained clarity. He felt the immense pressure of her hand and quickly moved his feet, feeling a chill down his spine as he appeared far away from the woman.

“My god! What was I just doing!” Chen Zhanbiao shook his head, appearing in front of Luo Tian.

“We were tricked by this woman!” Yan Jun looked grim, standing beside Luo Tian and protecting him.

“You can’t escape! Since soft methods failed, I’ll have to use force. I want to see who dares to save you!” Mao Qiulian’s face showed coldness, and a powerful pressure instantly fell upon Luo Tian and the others.

“My god!” Yan Jun couldn’t help shouting, finally seeing Mao Qiulian’s cultivation level. His eyes showed shock.

“Damn it! Half-step Era, how can we fight!” Yan Jun cursed, the overwhelming pressure making his movements difficult.

“No matter how we fight, we must fight! I’d rather commit suicide than fall into this old witch’s hands!” Luo Tian shook his head. He thought about what would happen if he were captured by her—there was no good outcome. It would be better to die with dignity.

“You don’t even have the strength to commit suicide in front of me!” Mao Qiulian sneered, her hand reaching toward Luo Tian and the others.

“Boom…” The black and white qi churned, thunderous sounds echoing through the stars. Amidst the churning black and white qi, a golden light flickered, and the zither melody rang out again.

“Lingxiao Melody!” Luo Tian’s face changed as he heard the elegant zither melody, his expression filled with joy.

“Jiang Nanxuan!” Luo Tian couldn’t help shouting, his voice filled with excitement. He gazed at the roaring Divine and Demon Ancient Cave.

“Boom…” As the zither melody rang out, Mao Qiulian’s hand, which she had summoned, shattered instantly and disappeared into the starry sky.

The flowing zither melody seemed gentle but contained an unparalleled killing intent and a shocking wave, sweeping toward Mao Qiulian.

The surging black and white qi revealed a figure in white robes, appearing before Luo Tian, Chen Zhanbiao, and Yan Jun.

The black and white qi swirled around the figure’s body, a calm aura spreading through the stars. He held a zither and appeared before Luo Tian’s group.

“Long time no see!” A calm voice echoed through the stars, and Jiang Nanxuan smiled at Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao.

“How did you get out!” Luo Tian couldn’t help asking, that was the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave, one of the nine deadly places. How could Jiang Nanxuan have walked out? It was enough to shock anyone.

“Some luck!” Jiang Nanxuan sighed, recalling his experiences in the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave. His face also showed a sense of nostalgia.

“Haha, a late-stage Sage, you dare to play tricks on me!” Before Luo Tian could ask further, pressure once again enveloped the four of them.

“Boom…” Mao Qiulian’s aura was terrifying, but even as Jiang Nanxuan's powerful zither melody struck her, it didn’t harm Mao Qiulian at all.

“Surviving from such a deadly place as the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave is indeed fortunate for you. But everything will belong to me, and so will you!” Mao Qiulian saw Jiang Nanxuan’s handsome face. Instead of fear, she showed a hint of joy, licking her blood-red lips. Her cultivation method favored geniuses with strong vitality; otherwise, she wouldn’t have targeted the divine clan’s sons.

“Come here all of you!” Mao Qiulian didn’t rush; although the four were powerful, they posed no threat in her eyes.

Mao Qiulian took a step forward with a playful smile, pink aura surrounding her. If one didn’t know Mao Qiulian’s background, they would think she was a beauty beyond compare. But to Luo Tian and the others, she was repulsive.

With each step Mao Qiulian took, the pressure on Luo Tian and the others grew stronger. Their bodies emitted a creaking sound.

Luo Tian handed the Shangtian Bow to Chen Zhanbiao, saying, “Zhanbiao, use this bow to shoot her!”

“Got it!” Chen Zhanbiao naturally didn’t object. The Shangtian Bow was gripped by Chen Zhanbiao, his arm as thick as a normal person’s thigh tensed with veins popping out. He pulled the Shangtian Bow.

“This kid’s body is even stronger! How did he grow like this? I’m starting to doubt it!” Jiang Nanxuan said, watching Chen Zhanbiao pull the Shangtian Bow with his body.

At the same time, Jiang Nanxuan sat down on the starry sky and a purple zither appeared before him.

“Luo Xiong, I’ve composed a new melody. What do you think?” Jiang Nanxuan remained calm and spoke to Luo Tian.

The zither melody rang out, and the pressure on the four of them vanished instantly.

“Break…” The zither melody transformed into an arrow, appearing in Chen Zhanbiao’s hand who had drawn the Shangtian Bow to its full moon.

Chen Zhanbiao released his hand, and the arrow vanished from the Shangtian Bow. An invisible wave, even stronger than the arrows Luo Tian had shot, left Luo Tian in disbelief.

“Trivial tricks! In front of absolute strength, your methods are useless! This attack is strong, but it’s not enough for a Half-Step Era!” Mao Qiulian sneered, raising her hand toward the void.

“Boom…” The invisible wave could annihilate a late-stage Sage and even harm a peak Sage. It was completely shattered by Mao Qiulian’s hand.

“What else do you have? Hurry up and use it! I like to see your desperate expressions!” Mao Qiulian took another step toward Luo Tian and the others.

Jiang Nanxuan seemed not to hear Mao Qiulian’s words, continuing to play his purple zither as if he had entered a certain state.

The elegant zither melody echoed, stirring the great momentum. What confused Luo Tian and the others was that the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave, which had just calmed down, once again emitted a series of thunderous sounds. The black and white dragons continuously exhaled within the cave, emitting waves that made people shudder.

“Again playing tricks! This time you won’t fool me!” Mao Qiulian sneered, raising her hand to strike Jiang Nanxuan.

Chapter 1129: The Divine and Demon Elder

Outside the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave, the elegant zither melody echoed in the starry sky. Jiang Nanxuan’s face was calm, as if he hadn’t seen the Half-Step Era Mao Qiulian approaching. His long fingers continuously plucked the purple zither before him.

“Annoying sound, I’ll kill you first!” Mao Qiulian’s face showed a hint of killing intent. Her hand rose high, and waves of power surged toward Jiang Nanxuan.

“Hum…” The humming sound echoed again, and the black and white qi rolled once more, forming two dragons that roared toward Jiang Nanxuan. They appeared above Jiang Nanxuan’s head, forming a black and white Taijitu that collided with Mao Qiulian's hand.

“Boom…” A moment later, Mao Qiulian’s face changed abruptly; she quickly retreated. Her gaze showed disbelief at Jiang Nanxuan's head.

The thunderous sound, Mao Qiulian’s powerful strike against the Taijitu, was as if a cow had entered the sea. It caused no harm to the Taijitu or Jiang Nanxuan and Luo Tian.

“How is it possible? A late-stage Sage could block my attack!” Mao Qiulian exclaimed, staring at the intact black and white Taijitu above Jiang Nanxuan’s head.

“I of course couldn’t block it, but in the Nine Realms, there are many strong people. Do you really think that being a Half-Step Era makes you the only one?” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, his voice filled with disdain. His fingers continuously plucked the zither strings.

Not only was Mao Qiulian shocked, but Luo Tian was also amazed. He hadn’t expected Jiang Nanxuan to have such a method to block a Half-Step Era’s attack. If this were known, it would shake the entire Nine Realms. This feat was so absurd it was like an ant crushing an elephant, leaving people in disbelief.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian and the others were confused, a series of thunderous sounds echoed from within the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave. The black and white qi churned, and amidst the churning, a black figure appeared in Luo Tian’s group's vision.

“Damn it!” As Luo Tian saw the black figure, he immediately cursed and started trembling. He grabbed Chen Zhanbiao and Yan Jun, preparing to flee.

A powerful aura instantly spread across the starry sky. The Divine and Demon Ancient Cave outside, with the black figure's appearance, caused the entire starry sky to tremble. The powerful black and white qi seemed docile like a child before this black figure, which resembled a demon god.

The demon figure moved swiftly and stepped out of the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave, appearing before Luo Tian’s group. The old man tightly closed his eyes as if he were dead, but even Mao Qiulian trembled and her legs shook uncontrollably.

“Dongbo Xin!” Luo Tian exclaimed, this Dongbo Xin was the one he had encountered in the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave who practiced both divine and demon arts. He was definitely the most terrifying person he had ever met, even defining Dongbo Xin as a superpower stronger than Gu Tian. Now, he was definitely someone to look up to.

“Roar…” Dongbo Xin roared, shaking the stars and causing celestial bodies to fall. Countless stars shattered under Dongbo Xin’s roar.

“Kill… Kill… Kill…” The sound was like a thunderclap, and the three words “kill” echoed from Dongbo Xin’s mouth. Slowly opening his eyes, black demon pupils appeared like two black holes, making people unable to escape. A wild killing intent radiated from the black pupils.

“Jiang Xiong, he… is he your creation?” Luo Tian’s teeth chattered, falling to the starry sky and unable to stand. He gazed at Jiang Nanxuan.

“Ping…” The zither melody continued, and Jiang Nanxuan wore a serious expression but didn’t respond to Luo Tian. The clear zither melody echoed in the starry sky, forming invisible symbols that entered Dongbo Xin’s ears.

“Who is this!” Mao Qiulian showed intense fear, her heart screaming to flee but finding herself unable to move. In front of Dongbo Xin, this starry sky seemed dominated by him; she couldn’t move without his permission.

The invisible zither melody entered Dongbo Xin’s body, causing his fierce body to pause slightly. Black demon pupils showed points of stars that gradually spread.

“Roar…” Dongbo Xin roared again, and those points of stars seemed to ignite something. They gradually spread within Dongbo Xin’s eyes, slowly expanding until holy light was shed, as if he had transformed from a demon to a god. His wild energy disappeared, replaced by a strong holy power.

Dongbo Xin bathed in the holy light, his entire body covered with a golden layer. His aura gradually calmed down as he gazed at Jiang Nanxuan.

“Is there anything?” A deep voice echoed, filled with supreme authority as Jiang Nanxuan spoke. Obviously, they knew each other.

“Encountered some trouble; I need your help!” Jiang Nanxuan didn’t hesitate, gazing at Dongbo Xin and then pointing to Mao Qiulian in the distance.

“Hmm… Indeed, I’ve sensed evil energy!” Dongbo Xin gazed at Mao Qiulian, frowning slightly. He extended his hand and immediately Mao Qiulian was before him.

“Mercy…” Mao Qiulian’s heart trembled, terrified beyond measure. In front of Dongbo Xin, she felt like facing the entire starry sky, feeling tiny and insignificant.

“Evil people should die!” Dongbo Xin spoke softly without listening to Mao Qiulian’s explanation. His eyes flashed two beams of cold light, piercing through Mao Qiulian's body instantly, blood and flesh flying everywhere. A supreme purification power instantly purified Mao Qiulian completely.

“My mom! This is the legendary ability to kill with a glance!” Yan Jun trembled, not expecting Dongbo Xin to be so变态. It was beyond his comprehension.

Even Chen Zhanbiao, who had never feared anything, trembled slightly with his massive body and stood behind Luo Tian, afraid that Dongbo Xin would glance at him.

“Is there anything else to resolve? I have limited time!” Dongbo Xin spoke, his voice calm. Even so, it gave Luo Tian and the others a great pressure.

“No problem; I can’t last long either!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face turned pale, and the zither melody stopped.

“Hum…” As Jiang Nanxuan’s zither melody ended, Dongbo Xin's face changed abruptly. He sighed deeply and black smoke surrounded him again.

“Boom…” Thunderous sounds echoed, and a massive altar flew out of the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave, instantly appearing before Dongbo Xin.

“Seal…” Symbols filled the sky as Dongbo Xin spoke softly, golden Era power flying from his hands into the altar.

Symbols filled the sky, and countless symbol dragons with supreme pressure flew out of the altar.

“I’m leaving!” Dongbo Xin nodded to Jiang Nanxuan, then his brows furrowed slightly as he looked at Luo Tian. But finally, he shook his head and sat on the altar, allowing countless symbol dragons to wrap around him.

“Roar…” Black smoke surged upward, and Dongbo Xin returned to his previous mad state. Demon energy continuously flowed from him.

Symbols filled the sky, and a powerful sealing power wrapped Dongbo Xin. Luo Tian even felt familiar heavenly will power within the sealing power.

“Powerful! It takes heavenly will to suppress this Dongbo Xin!” Luo Tian sighed lowly, watching the now-closed-eyed Dongbo Xin gradually calm down and sit on the altar. If one hadn’t seen Dongbo Xin kill a Half-Step Era like Mao Qiulian, no one would have thought this Dongbo Xin was so absurd.

Jiang Nanxuan waved his hand, collecting the altar and Dongbo Xin together, a smile on his face: “How did it go with the divine clan?”

“Don’t talk about me. Tell me how you got out and who that powerful person was… How did you do it…” Luo Tian handed a pill to Jiang Nanxuan.

“It was a coincidence. I was devoured by the Tianhua Divine and Demon Flower, but instead of dying, I survived in another form. However, I don’t know why, I ended up merging with the Tianhua Divine and Demon Flower. Now I can say that I am the Tianhua Divine and Demon Flower, and the Tianhua Divine and Demon Flower is me!”

“As for that powerful person, you saw him before. The Tianhua Divine and Demon Flower provided vitality to enter the powerful person’s body. Now I am the Tianhua Divine and Demon Flower, so he naturally can’t be far from me!”

“The Tianhua Divine and Demon Flower is skilled in illusions. I could use the zither melody to briefly put Dongbo Xin into an illusion, restoring his normal state. However, it was only for a moment—just one minute. If longer, I would suffer backlash!” Jiang Nanxuan explained the cause and effect to Luo Tian. Meanwhile, Luo Tian truthfully informed Jiang Nanxuan about his journey with the divine clan.

As they walked and talked, they soon entered the demon clan’s territory, feeling safe at last. Jiang Nanxuan chose to return to the battlefield between the divine clan and the Four Sacred Star Domains. Luo Tian didn’t stop him; with Jiang Nanxuan summoning a later-era power to fight for one minute, he was now an unbeatable presence in the Nine Realms. Even those with later-era resources couldn’t withstand Dongbo Xin’s attack, as his vitality was still strong.

“Go on; I feel at ease with Jiang Nanxuan!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, not entering the demon mountain but flying directly toward the妖域.

On another side, on the divine clan’s sacred mountain, Gu Tianshu's robe was stained with blood. His ancient heavenly palace protected him as he unleashed two black flames, terrifying temperatures that seemed to melt the entire demon mountain.

These two black flames were Gu Tianshu’s greatest secret, cultivated in his dantian. They were a divine fire that had evolved into a human form and achieved the status of an Era Master. This black flame was what that fire spirit had left for Gu Family, the essence of the entire Gu Family.

Chapter 1130: Waiting

Luo Tian, Chen Zhanbiao, and Yan Jun returned to Tongtian Mountain in the Fire Domain under the stars. The Tongtian Mountain was unusually tense, as most of the Four Sacred Star Domains had moved there. These days, Wang Xuanning and others were busy. However, the Four Sacred Star Domains had only stayed for a few days before organizing an army to head toward the Divine and Demon Realms, leaving only the elderly, weak, and sick behind on Tongtian Mountain.

When Luo Tian and the others appeared at Tongtian Mountain, it was as if a storm had swept through. Everyone knew that the Four Sacred Star Domains’ group had gone to rescue Luo Tian, and the people of Tongtian Mountain were constantly monitoring the situation in the Divine and Demon Realms. If those people failed, they would have to bear the divine clan’s wrath. After all, the Four Sacred Star Domains and Fire Domain were now tied together like a single rope.

“Luo Tian!” Sha Cangmang, the old tortoise Xuanwu, and Chen Xuanning sat at Tongtian Mountain. The native forces of the Fire Domain—Du Hongtao, head of the Shanhai Pavilion, and Lu Han Tian, abbot of Chongxiao Temple—had also arrived at Tongtian Mountain with their sects. Luo Tian’s appearance immediately caught their attention.

“Respected elder!” Luo Tian bowed to them, his face showing gratitude.

“Father… Uncle… Master…” The next generation of Luo Tian’s group approached, bowing to him with anxious expressions.

“You’ve returned safely, so they must have succeeded!” Lu Han Tian smiled slightly and spoke to Luo Tian.

“How come they didn’t return with you?” Chen Xuanning and the others looked puzzled, their questions causing Luo Tian some headache.

“I was heavily injured and need rest. As for the others, they’ll return!” Luo Tian comforted them, his body moving as he followed everyone into the Tongtian Gate’s council hall.

Sitting in the council hall, Luo Tian recounted the entire incident to everyone. The whole hall fell silent, their gazes turning toward Luo Tian, who had now become the group’s pillar.

“Luo Tian, speak up—fight or wait? If we fight, the two domains’ forces can match others in the Nine Realms!” They spoke, their voices filled with urgency.

“Wait. I believe they’ll return!” Luo Tian replied to them, gazing at the void as if he saw a battlefield.

In truth, Luo Tian was more anxious than anyone else. They were all connected to him in some way; if one died, he would blame himself for life.

But Luo Tian couldn’t let the two domains lose more. If they were all lost in the Divine and Demon Realms, the two domains would be destroyed completely. Future challenges with the冥域 (Netherworld) would also need to be faced. Luo Tian couldn’t bear to watch the two domains perish. He felt a sense that the Netherworld’s upheaval was near.
