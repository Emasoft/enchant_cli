Luo Tian gave a slight nod, knowing that pondering now was futile. He extended his hand, and emerald-green flames appeared in his palm, raising the room's temperature.

Lu Kunpeng, upon seeing the emerald crystal flame in Luo Tian’s hand, wore a wistful expression. He swiftly swallowed the cold-emitting pill in his hand.

“Crack…” As Lu Kunpeng had just swallowed the Ice Extreme Pill, a series of sounds echoed from his body. His entire form was enveloped in cold mist, the frigid chill causing him to shiver involuntarily. He then nodded at Luo Tian.

Seeing Lu Kunpeng’s gesture, Luo Tian’s expression turned solemn. He flicked his fingers, sending the emerald crystal flame into Lu Kunpeng’s mouth. Simultaneously, his spiritual awareness followed the fire into Lu Kunpeng’s body.

Luo Tian’s solemnity flickered before he closed his eyes, sensing the frozen meridians within Lu Kunpeng’s body under the Ice Extreme Pill’s influence.

“Ten… a hundred…” Time passed slowly, and Luo Tian’s forehead broke into a light sweat. Though his spiritual awareness remained intact, his physical strength waned.

An hour passed in silence. Luo Tian’s body trembled slightly. Suddenly, he snapped his eyes open, a glimmer of joy in them.

“I found it!” Luo Tian murmured, his spiritual awareness revealing a minuscule black insect moving slowly within Lu Kunpeng’s dantian. Despite his spiritual awareness, it took immense effort to detect the creature.

At that moment, the emerald crystal flame transformed into a miniature fire dragon, rushing toward the insect and enveloping it.

The insect, sensing the flame’s terror, halted abruptly. Its tiny body trembled within Luo Tian’s spiritual awareness.

Luo Tian smiled, extending his finger to press against Lu Kunpeng’s dantian. His fingers moved slowly.

The insect, guided by Luo Tian’s movements, wriggled through Lu Kunpeng’s meridians.

“Ah…” Lu Kunpeng’s face glistened with sweat, his body emitting a hissing sound.

The frozen meridians began to melt under the emerald crystal flame’s searing heat, a pain so excruciating it left Lu Kunpeng in agony.

…

While Luo Tian expelled the insect from Lu Kunpeng, news of Luo Tian’s destruction of the Feiyan City spread across the Northern Region.

A major sect had slain a city’s lord—nothing remarkable in people’s eyes. Yet Feiyan City was no ordinary place; it housed a Soul-Annihilation Stage master, Tai Hong. Even second-tier sects lacked such power. Luo Tian’s might left the Northern Region’s major sects awestruck.

Simultaneously, these top sects discovered a critical issue: the teleportation array was broken.

Indeed, the teleportation array had failed, severing all passage to other regions. The only option was to trek on foot—a plight for the Northern Region’s people.

The most enraged were the major sects, as one month remained until the Xiangu Ruins opened. Without teleportation, they could only walk to the Southern Region.

Even a Soul-Annihilation Stage master would require half a month of flight, while those at the Spirit-Soul Stage would need a month. Though sect elders had inspected the array and confirmed it could be repaired, it would take nearly two months. This delay was unbearable.

Instantly, all sects resented Luo Tian again, but their anger was futile. They could only prepare for the arduous journey, led by an elder to safeguard their disciples en route to the Xiangu Ruins.

The Wuxing Sect was no exception. Master Wei Mingxuan cursed Luo Tian upon learning the news, then hurriedly organized preparations for the Xiangu Ruins.

Unaware of these events, Luo Tian’s face was pale as a sheet. His fingers moved gently over Lu Kunpeng’s throat, applying slight pressure to draw the emerald crystal flame back through his mouth.

“Huff…” Luo Tian exhaled deeply, one hand hovering with the emerald flame, the other wiping sweat from his brow.

Lu Kunpeng felt a sudden lightness in his body. Though the parasite had caused no harm, he’d carried psychological weight. Now freed, his mood brightened considerably.

“Success!” Zhang Ziping and the others exclaimed, their faces alight with joy as they glanced at Luo Tian and Lu Kunpeng.

“Grand Elder… do you have any food?” Luo Tian collapsed to the ground, his legs stiff from an hour and a half of standing. His stomach growled—since morning, he’d eaten nothing.

Lu Kunpeng and the others chuckled at Luo Tian’s words, quickly sending Lin Zhengyang outside to prepare a meal.

As they laughed, Wei Mingxuan’s voice echoed from Lu Kunpeng’s courtyard: “Luo Tian! You little scoundrel, come out!”

“Huh…” Luo Tian and the others froze. Wei Mingxuan’s usual composure had vanished, his voice laced with fury.

Before they could respond, Wei Mingxuan burst into the hall, his face flushed with anger.

“Master, what’s going on?” Lu Kunpeng asked, addressing Wei Mingxuan, who trembled with rage.

“You see this,” Wei Mingxuan snapped, tossing a jade slip into Zhang Ziping’s hands. “Read it and understand!”

Zhang Ziping opened the slip, his brows furrowing as he passed it to Luo Tian.

“Too… excessive!” Luo Tian muttered, his voice weak. His face bore a苦笑 as he glanced at the others.

The sects had unanimously decided Luo Tian alone was responsible for destroying the teleportation array, demanding the Wuxing Sect bear its repair costs and compensate for the journey to the Southern Region.

“We won’t pay! Who dares approach our Wuxing Sect?” Lei Yong’s temper flared.

“What do we do, little brat? You caused this!” Wei Mingxuan glared at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian furrowed his brow. If Lei Yong’s words held true, the Wuxing Sect would alienate all Northern Region sects—a disastrous move.

Yet Luo Tian’s lips twitched as he calculated the compensation sum: ten million spiritual stones. For any sect, this was astronomical—clearly, the sects viewed the Wuxing Sect’s alchemy hall as a cash cow.

Zhang Ziping observed Luo Tian’s contemplation, choosing not to interrupt. He knew Luo Tian’s mind and cultivation were no longer inferior; he could handle this alone, no longer the child needing protection.

“Master, send a message to these sects: one million spiritual stones per sect, plus a condition. If we clash in the Xiangu Ruins, I’ll grant them mercy or aid.”

“Only send this to sects with good relations or no enmity. For those with friction, offer one million stones—else, prepare for war.” Luo Tian spoke calmly.

Wei Mingxuan’s eyes gleamed with approval, admiration for Luo Tian evident.

“Good plan. But your words may seem arrogant, inciting more hatred from these prodigies,” Wei Mingxuan cautioned.

“Doesn’t matter. They’ve always seen me as arrogant. Master, proceed with the message.” Luo Tian shrugged.

“Fine,” Wei Mingxuan nodded.

He then observed Luo Tian’s state, murmuring: “Prepare yourselves too. Tomorrow we depart for the Southern Region. You’re a troublemaker, and your current state will make this journey arduous.”

“Huh…” Luo Tian and the others exchanged glances, suddenly recalling they’d have to trek or ride dragons.

Luo Tian’s condition made flight impossible; he’d have to ride a dragon, which would be slower than flying.

“Let Ziping lead,” Wei Mingxuan ignored Luo Tian’s bewilderment, addressing Zhang Ziping.

“I won’t go. Let my three younger brothers accompany you,” Zhang Ziping smiled, patting Luo Tian’s back.

But Lu Kunpeng and Wei Mingxuan fell silent, their eyes locking on Zhang Ziping.

“No, you must go,” Wei Mingxuan’s tone left no room for argument.

“Huh?” Luo Tian and Lei Yong, Jicheng felt an unease.

“You decide!” Zhang Ziping met Wei Mingxuan’s gaze, his resolve unshaken.

The room grew tense. Finally, Wei Mingxuan relented, his face etched with sorrow as he left without another word. Luo Tian sensed Wei Mingxuan aged decades in that moment, his sigh vanishing from view.

“Perhaps you should go… after all, the alchemy hall…” Lu Kunpeng glanced at Zhang Ziping, hesitating.

Luo Tian was lost in the conversation, unaware of their hidden agenda.

Yet Zhang Ziping and the others said nothing more; Luo Tian and Lei Yong didn’t inquire. Unknowingly, a restlessness stirred within them.

“Go prepare,” Zhang Ziping instructed. “Tomorrow will test you.” He addressed the three, then retreated to his quarters.

Lu Kunpeng sighed, returning to his room, leaving Luo Tian and the others in mutual bewilderment.

“What’s going on? Are they hiding something?” Lei Yong asked Luo Tian and Jicheng.

They shook their heads, each heading to their quarters. Luo Tian didn’t return home but ascended the main peak, dining at Yan Yue Tower before returning to his initial Wuxing Sect courtyard.

The room had been tidied—no doubt by Ning Yuer, who often visited. A faint fragrance lingered.

“Why do the elders and Master keep secrets from us?” Luo Tian muttered, a faint sense of foreboding. The entire Tianyuan Continent seemed shrouded in tension, and their journey into the Xiangu Ruins felt like fleeing a catastrophe.

After a day’s exhaustion, Luo Tian fell into a deep sleep, plagued by nightmares of the Master and elders perishing, a world-ending disaster engulfing Tianyuan. All those connected to him met their end in this calamity.

Chapter 579: Departure for the Southern Region

Morning sun warmed Luo Tian’s face, rousing him from sleep. His eyes were red-rimmed, his complexion pale from the night’s torment.

Luo Tian chuckled bitterly. Ordinary life was tolerable for a day or two, but prolonged, it felt alien.

“Dong… dong… dong…” The solemn bell echoed across Wuxing Mountain, jolting Luo Tian from his thoughts. He quickly tidied himself and strode toward the main peak’s square.

All Wuxing Sect disciples gathered at the square, aware today marked their journey to the Southern Region.

Luo Tian moved through the crowd, his gaze calm. The disciples’ faces bore reverence—news of Luo Tian’s city-destroying feat had spread, elevating the sect’s prestige.

At the crowd’s edge stood Zhang Ziping. Luo Tian observed hundreds of disciples from various peaks, including older peers like Ji Yunhai and Wang Yulan, younger ones like Jiang Yucheng, and contemporaries like Feng Qianyu and Zhang Hongyun.

Wei Mingxuan surveyed the disciples, a wistful smile on his face. The sect had blossomed with prodigies in recent years, and he believed it would ascend to Northern Region dominance.

Yet he shook his head, addressing the disciples: “The Xiangu Ruins’ precautions are clear. Now, let’s proceed.” He nodded to a senior elder.

“Roar…” A dragon’s cry echoed, its massive form materializing before the elder, bowing in affection.

“Luo Tian leads this journey. Any objections?” Wei Mingxuan addressed the disciples.

None protested; Luo Tian’s authority was undeniable. Though he was merely a commoner, none dared underestimate him—Lei Yong, Jicheng, and Dong Sansi stood as his protectors.

The four ascended the dragon’s back amid the disciples’ fervent cheers, but Zhang Ziping was absent.

Though Zhang Ziping was under a century old, he could enter the Xiangu Ruins. Yet he chose not to.

Wang Yulan and Feng Qianyu also boarded the dragon, determined to shield Luo Tian.

Fifteen individuals—Wuxing Sect’s most outstanding prodigies—mounted the dragon.

“Go, and don’t disgrace our sect!” Wei Mingxuan addressed them.

“Luo Tian! Remember, if you meet my disciple, bring him back. I believe your strength will suffice after emerging from the Xiangu Ruins!” Wu Taiping, the Toxic Peak Master, called.

“I’ve longed to see my disciple. Luo Tian, I entrust him to you!” Mu Nianqing of the Greenwood Peak added.

Luo Tian’s eyes hardened as he met their longing gazes. “Master, I’ll return Qianxue and Gu Lei.”

“Roar…” The dragon’s cry interrupted their thoughts. Air currents rose as the dragon soared skyward, heading south.

“Will we meet again after this departure?” Wei Mingxuan murmured, his voice barely audible.

The peak masters exchanged glances, their expressions deepening.

…

Luo Tian and the fifteen disciples sat on the dragon’s back, their gazes lingering on the receding Wuxing Sect. They pondered the uncertain return.

The Northern Region’s distance from the Southern Region was vast, so the dragon sped ahead under the elder’s guidance.

Time passed slowly; they neared the Southern Region by the seventh day.

Meanwhile, other sects had mobilized. Even second-tier sects sent disciples toward the South, led by elders—though these were merely Soul-Annihilation Stage masters.

The sky swarmed with light, countless figures flying southward.

Luo Tian was guarded by Lei Yong and others, their vigilance evident. He smiled: “No need to be tense. Your unease makes me seem ordinary. Just carry on as usual.”

His vast spiritual awareness scanned the surroundings, detecting any suspicious figures.

“Uncle, do you think we’ll be unlucky and meet those bandits? If so, should we just pay up?” A young disciple asked an elder.

The elder’s cultivation was modest, likely having failed the Soul-Annihilation Trial. Why he survived remained unclear to Luo Tian.

The elder chuckled: “Don’t worry. Our luck isn’t that bad. If we do, I’ll make them flee.”

They passed Luo Tian’s group, heading south.

“Bandits?” Luo Tian’s brow furrowed.

Chapter 580: The Bandits Who Stole the Northern Region’s Fame

Luo Tian thought of Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbao, the bandits who had left Wuxing Sect. Their silence was suspicious.

His guess was correct—these bandits were indeed Chen Zhanbao and Xu Liyi, now renowned in the Northern Region. In five days, they’d carved a name for themselves.

After leaving Wuxing Sect, they studied the Northern Region’s map, choosing a route to the Southern Region. They knew no teleportation meant sects would trek southward.

Their strength was formidable; they’d robbed many, leaving none unscathed. Soul-Annihilation Stage masters escaped easily, while Spirit-Soul Stage disciples were no match. Their fame spread swiftly.

Luo Tian’s group, riding the dragon, lagged behind others. Along the way, many passed them, discussing these bandits.

Luo Tian recognized the description—eighty percent certain they were Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbao.

“You two chose well,” he mused.

On the tenth day since leaving Wuxing Sect, they neared the bandits’ location.

“Luo Tian, this is where the bandits are,” Lei Yong said, his gaze fixed ahead. The elder halted the dragon.

No need for Lei Yong’s words—Luo Tian’s spiritual awareness had already probed two leagues ahead. His brow furrowed.

A chaotic surge of energy echoed from the scene: Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbao battling a boy aged fifteen or sixteen. The clash sent tremors through the air.

Most shocking was Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbao’s struggle against the boy, even appearing outmatched.

Below them, a group of young disciples lay bound, their cultivation sealed and discarded. Their faces bore resentment as they watched the battle above.

“This boy… feels familiar,” Luo Tian muttered, confusion deepening.

“Stop!” Lei Yong and others sensed the battle and halted the dragon, their gazes sharp.

“Let’s attack! Who dares rob us?” A disciple sneered.

Ning Qingzhu, eager for spectacle, grinned. His cultivation had reached the Spirit-Soul Peak; he’d never been subdued by anyone but Jicheng and Wang Yulan. Now, with a show, he couldn’t resist.

The others chuckled at Ning Qingzhu’s anticipation. As one of the sect’s elder disciples, no one dared object.

Luo Tian knew Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbao were fighting the boy, so he nodded. The dragon flew toward the battle.

…

The clash erupted. Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbao fought the boy, their confidence shaken.

These bandits had ruled this region for days, robbing many and angering others. Yet they’d never feared anyone—escaping Soul-Annihilation Stage masters effortlessly.

Xu Liyi believed no one could escape their grasp, and only a few had slipped away. But today, he faced the most gifted individual after Luo Tian: this boy.

The boy’s youth unnerved Xu Liyi, who dismissed him as a child. He believed Chen Zhanbao alone could subdue him.

But when Chen Zhanbao clashed with the boy, Xu Liyi grew wary. The boy’s strength was undeniable—Chen Zhanbao’s body, which Xu Liyi deemed invincible, was repelled.

Chen Zhanbao, though slow-witted, wasn’t blind. He knew he lacked spiritual energy but relied on brute strength. Yet this boy matched his might, even pushing him back.

Chen Zhanbao was exhilarated—his first opponent to match his strength. He entered a state of unity with the heavens.

Xu Liyi was stunned; even in this state, Chen Zhanbao was outmatched.

Worried for his brother’s safety, Xu Liyi joined the fight. The boy, however, was resilient, facing two opponents without fear. Golden light flickered as he fought back.

As the battle intensified, Luo Tian’s dragon approached five leagues away. The disciples shielded Luo Tian, their expressions grave.

“Stop!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed in their minds via spiritual awareness, halting Chen Zhanbao. His eyes cleared.

Xu Liyi and the boy had sensed their approach but couldn’t stop. With Luo Tian’s command, they ceased fighting and retreated.

“Luo Tian!” Xu Liyi’s face lit up with joy, sensing the group’s power.

But a moment later, Xu Liyi was stunned.

The dragon, upon seeing the boy, trembled violently and plummeted toward the ground.

Chapter 581: The Grown-Up Dragon Baby

Luo Tian and the others were startled. Especially the elder guiding the dragon, who was bewildered—no matter how he communicated, the dragon seemed deaf. Its eyes glowed with fear, plummeting toward the earth.

“Come up!” The boy shouted at Luo Tian’s group, his voice carrying a dragon’s aura.

“Roar…” The dragon responded, its wings flapping hesitantly as it ascended.

“What the hell is going on?” Xu Liyi stared at the boy, stunned.

The dragon’s rank was low, but it was a dragon—proud and unyielding. No one had ever commanded it so authoritatively.

Luo Tian smiled, suspecting the boy’s identity. As he approached, a bond of blood stirred within him, filling him with joy—though uncertainty lingered.

As the dragon obediently ascended beneath the boy, its eyes full of reverence, the boy transformed into a golden meteor, rushing toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Be careful!” Lei Yong shouted, summoning a thunder shield before Luo Tian.

Others formed barriers of colorful spiritual energy, guarding Luo Tian. Their gazes were wary as the golden light approached.

“Don’t panic—this is an ally!” Luo Tian smiled, his joy evident.

“Make way!” The boy’s voice carried a golden aura, striking the barriers.

“Boom…” Three Spirit-Soul Peak disciples were hurled back, their eyes wide with disbelief.

Lei Yong and others swayed but held firm against the boy’s attack.

“Big brother!” The boy called Luo Tian, his voice youthful yet clear.

“Dragon Baby!” Luo Tian’s face softened, calling back as he gazed at the boy.

“Dragon… Baby…” The Wuxing Sect disciples stared, their faces stunned.

Most who knew Luo Tian recognized Dragon Baby—his time at the sect was long, especially the incident of his bone-annihilation seal and the boy’s antics during the battle with the Tianshi Sect.

Lei Yong and Jicheng, hearing Luo Tian’s call, lowered their guard, their expressions bewildered.

The Dragon Baby had been a small boy with a diaper, but now he was a prodigy. They couldn’t reconcile this youth with the child they remembered.

Yet, trusting Luo Tian’s word, they accepted him as the Dragon Baby sealed within Luo Tian.

The boy transformed into a golden light, rushing to Luo Tian’s side. His face lit with excitement as he embraced Luo Tian.

“Crack…” Luo Tian’s face contorted in pain, his cheeks flushed red. He forced a smile, patting the boy’s back with all his strength—yet he could barely speak.

“Ah…” The boy sensed Luo Tian’s pain and released him, his eyes puzzled.

“I didn’t use much strength!” The boy, now grown, spoke like a naive child, his eyes innocent.

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian cleared his throat, patting the boy’s head. “I’m fine; I just had some issues.”

“Hmm?” The boy sensed Luo Tian’s condition, his face darkening.

“Who hurt you? I feel like you’re missing something!” The boy shouted, his voice radiating pressure. The dragon nearly plummeted again.

“Don’t worry—rest for a while. Tell me how you fought them?” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbao approaching.

“They’re villains! They robbed me!” The boy crossed his arms, his face serious. “Big brother, I’ve grown up—don’t call me Dragon Baby anymore. My name is Long Jie!”

“Big brother, wait here. I’ll deal with these two!” The boy, sensing Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbao’s hostility, surged forward.

“Come back, Dragon Baby! They’re allies!” Luo Tian shouted but couldn’t stop the boy.

Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbao, sensing the boy’s hostility, smiled bitterly and halted. Their forms were disheveled.

Chen Zhanbao’s upper body was bare, revealing his toned muscles and bruises. Xu Liyi fared no better, his robes torn and a lump on his head.

“Little brother, we’re allies! We know your big brother!” Xu Liyi rubbed his head, addressing the boy.

“You’re villains! You robbed me!” The boy crossed his arms, skeptical.

“Long… Long Jie. They are indeed my friends. Come back!” Luo Tian stepped forward, calling the boy by his new name.

The boy trusted Luo Tian’s words over others. He pouted, returning to Luo Tian’s side but still eyeing Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbao with hostility.

“Luo Tian, your speed is too slow!” Xu Liyi rubbed his head, smiling bitterly.

Today, he’d been thoroughly defeated—his first time so disheveled since beginning his banditry.
