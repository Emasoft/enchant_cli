“Man Lie!” Chu Chen gritted his teeth, staring at Man Lie beside Man Zhen, whose eyes gleamed with smugness. He instantly guessed the situation.

“Lord of Qinghe City! I am the chieftain of Shigui Village. We do not know what crime we have committed, Lord Qinghe City!” Though the chieftain’s heart trembled with fear, he was a man who had seen great affairs. He bowed respectfully to Man Zhen.

“What crime? Do I need to say it? Do you know who he is? He is a human, the sworn enemy of the Man tribe. You harbored him—this is a capital crime!” Man Zhen’s face was cold as he gazed at the chieftain of Shigui Village.

When Man Zhen and two hundred iron riders appeared above Shigui Village, the villagers emerged from their homes to gather beneath the altar. Their gazes trembled as they looked up at Man Zhen’s imposing presence.

Man Zhen radiated an overwhelming aura. Alone, he filled the villagers with despair; worse still, two hundred iron riders followed him—war machines trained by Man Zhen himself. These were the foundation of his power in Qinghe City and the city’s strength against rivals.

Yet Shigui Village’s men, women, and children still seized their weapons. The Man tribe had no cowards.

“Hills of poverty and barren land produce only villains. How dare you, a tiny Shigui Village, defy my Qinghe Iron Riders!” Man Lie sneered, his voice laced with contempt.

“Crack…” Chu Chen’s body shuddered as he gazed at Man Zhen in the sky. From start to finish, Man Zhen had ignored him as if he were invisible, forgetting his very existence within Shigui Village.

“Go! Flatten this village!” Man Zhen commanded his two hundred riders, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian within the cauldron.

“Yes!” The riders roared with might, their eyes scanning the two hundred villagers below like beasts. No emotion flickered in their gazes—these were war machines, bred for battle. Shigui Village’s people could not withstand even a single charge, not even the chieftain at Sage Peak.

“Father!” Chu Chen roared, flying into the sky to stand opposite Man Zhen. His eyes burned crimson as he stared at Man Zhen.

“Hm?” Seeing Chu Chen before him, calling him father, Man Zhen’s face flickered with confusion. He waved a hand to halt the riders’ charge.

“Chu Chen?” As if recalling he had such a son, Man Zhen scrutinized Chu Chen closely before his eyes flashed with sharp intensity.

“Sage?” Man Zhen’s heart stirred upon seeing Chu Chen had reached Sage level. In this tiny village, to reach Sage was proof of extraordinary talent.

“Good! Once this matter is resolved, you shall return with me to Qinghe City!” Man Zhen spoke as if granting a favor.

“Father!” Before Chu Chen could speak, Man Lie grew anxious. He had not expected his father to be swayed by Chu Chen’s talent—this was not the outcome he desired.

“Father, I once wished to take this human away, but Chu Chen obstructed me repeatedly. If not for his interference, this human would have already been delivered to you by now!” Man Lie spoke, his voice tinged with urgency. He could not allow Chu Chen to return to Qinghe City.

“Do you have the right to speak?” Man Zhen snorted, and Man Lie shrank back. He turned his gaze back to Chu Chen.

“Go! Bring this human to me—this is your chance at redemption!” Man Zhen commanded, his voice laced with authority. Chu Chen’s face broke into cold sweat.

“I beg to differ, Father. Luo Tian has done me great kindness. Without him, every soul in Shigui Village—including myself—would have perished at the hands of the Sandflow Bandits. The Man tribe values loyalty; even if he is human, I beg you to spare his life!” Chu Chen spoke boldly, his tone neither submissive nor defiant.

“Crack…” A sharp slap echoed in the sky. Chu Chen’s massive body crashed to the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust and leaving a deep crater.

“You call returning to Qinghe City an act of mercy? You dare bargain with me!” Man Zhen snorted, his gaze now cold.

A Sage Peak’s slap—Chu Chen could not withstand it. His head nearly split open, but Man Zhen held back his full strength; otherwise, one slap would have ended him.

“Hah… a fool!” Man Lie thought coldly, his gaze on Chu Chen. For years, no one in Qinghe City had dared defy Man Zhen’s will.

Chu Chen’s heart grew cold as he slowly rose, his body numb. Man Zhen’s slap had finally jolted him awake.

“I give you one last chance: bring this human to me, return with me to Qinghe City. You are still my son. I will even petition the Manhun Temple to grant you a surname! If you persist in your defiance, then let this village perish with you!” Man Zhen’s voice held no emotion.

“I cannot, Father. Shigui Village raised me; Luo Tian saved my life. To turn on those who have shown me kindness—I cannot!” Chu Chen spoke each word clearly, his tone icy as if he no longer recognized Man Zhen.

“Good! Good! Good! Then do not blame me!” Man Zhen’s voice trembled with fury. He commanded his two hundred riders to destroy the village.

“Boom… boom…” The iron riders surged like a storm, charging toward Shigui Village’s people.

“Damn it! Fight back!” The villagers erupted with bloodlust, striking their stone weapons in anticipation of the riders’ arrival.

“Done!” The chieftain’s face twisted with despair. He knew Shigui Village would be erased.

“Lord Qinghe City, are you truly determined to exterminate us?” The chieftain’s face bore madness as he addressed Man Zhen.

“Exterminate? What of it!” Man Zhen ignored the chieftain, his hand reaching for the cauldron atop the altar.

“Fine! Let us burn together!” The chieftain’s face lit with madness. He raised his hands, and a crystalline bone staff materialized in his grip.

“Boom… boom…” The two hundred riders shattered the sky, charging toward Shigui Village’s people. Bone spears pierced through twenty villagers instantly.

“Ode of the ancestors! Bless your descendants!” The chieftain prayed, hurling his staff into the sky.

“Roar…” A deep growl echoed in their ears, and the sky trembled—but the chieftain’s face was filled with terror.

“What is this?” He realized the terrifying energy did not come from his staff but from the cauldron itself.

At that moment, Man Zhen appeared beside the cauldron, his hand reaching for Luo Tian. Before he could touch him, a powerful aura surged forth, forcing Man Zhen back with immense pressure.

“Recovery?” The chieftain lowered his staff, eyes filled with hope as he watched the cauldron. He longed to see Luo Tian’s strength after his recovery—perhaps there was still a chance.

“Luo… Luo brother!” Chu Chen’s face lit with excitement, as if grasping a lifeline. He shouted loudly.

A radiant aura surged from the cauldron, golden light flashing outward. It coalesced into a sword of unparalleled sharpness, slicing through the air in a storm of blade winds. The storm swept toward Man Zhen’s two hundred riders.

“Puff… puff…” Golden sword light cut through the riders like wheat, reducing them to limbs and severed bodies that fell to the ground.

Chapter 1227: Crush Man Zhen

Above Nangling, golden waves surged downward. Golden sword winds instantly claimed the lives of two hundred Qinghe Riders, their limbs and bodies scattered across Shigui Village. Blood dyed the village red.

A crushing pressure enveloped everyone’s minds, even Man Zhen at Sage Peak stood motionless.

“Crash… crash…” A golden-clad figure rose from the cauldron, radiant like a god. The villagers gasped in awe as Luo Tian’s presence filled them with suffocating energy, his body roaring with thunderous sounds.

“Luo Tian is so powerful!” The villagers marveled, sensing an overwhelming aura from him.

“Half-Era!” Man Zhen’s fear deepened, his voice trembling with disbelief.

“How is this possible? Even among the human Seven Star Island, those with Half-Era strength are rare. Their records are well-documented across the Manhun Continent. Why did I not know of this human?” Man Zhen’s mind reeled, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

His regret was immense; if he had known Luo Tian’s strength, he would never have come so openly. He would have reported to the Manhun Temple and had its elite eliminate Luo Tian!

A Half-Era human alone could earn a fortune in rewards. Yet now, Luo Tian filled Man Zhen with despair.

“There is still a chance. Human flesh is weak; if I can close the distance, I may have an opportunity to kill him!” Man Zhen’s mind raced. He pushed forward despite the pressure, approaching Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian!” Though Man Zhen’s actions were subtle, the villagers saw through his deception. They roared Luo Tian’s name.

“Die!” Man Zhen’s thick fist rose, crashing down like a hammer. The villagers doubted Luo Tian could withstand it—his body looked too frail.

“Buzz…” Golden light flared again as Luo Tian opened his eyes, his gaze shifting from chaos to clarity. He looked up at Man Zhen’s fist and smiled coldly.

“Go…!” Luo Tian’s voice was icy as he raised his fist, delivering a straightforward punch. It collided with Man Zhen’s fist.

“Crack…” The collision erupted into a storm of energy, scattering Luo Tian’s black hair and swirling his robes.

To their amazement, Man Zhen’s body was thrown back, spitting blood and his thick arm shattered.

“I’m back! I am Luo Tian!” Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at the sky as if seeing someone across the stars. His eyes held deep longing.

“Is this the Tenth Domain of the Man tribe?” Luo Tian sighed softly, surprised he had returned to life and been transported to the Tenth Domain by the Epoch Book. This was the star domain sealed by the Celestial Master.

“The Epoch Book… what are you? You can even revive the dead!” Luo Tian sensed the book in his mind, whispering.

“Regardless… I must find a way back to the Nine Domains!” As soon as Luo Tian recovered, he knew his next task: find any means to return to the Nine Domains.

Far away, the Nine Domains had been rebuilt with the combined strength of the Four Holy Star Domains. The Tianyuan Continent also restored its former glory.

In the Five Elements Sect, amidst countless soul-lamps, four women sat in meditation. Between them stood a lamp that had been extinguished for many days.

When Luo Tian opened his eyes and fully revived, it seemed something responded. The four extremely beautiful women slowly opened their eyes, exchanged glances, then focused on the lamp between them.

These four women were Gu Qianxue, Leng Qiuchan, Jiang Sxi, and Sun Mengru. After learning of Luo Tian’s death, they refused to believe it. They ignored others’ advice and kept Luo Tian’s soul-lamp, waiting for a miracle.

“Sizzle…” The lamp wick emitted sounds. White wicks glowed with sparks, and under the women’s joyous gaze, flickers of flame rose.

“It lit!” The four women wept with tears in their eyes, gazing at the slowly glowing lamp.

“I said he wasn’t dead! How could he die!” Gu Qianxue stood, gazing at the lamp with a soft voice.

“Believe he’ll return soon! If he does, we must prepare!” The four women laughed through their tears, placing the lamp back and leaving the hall.

“Sneeze…” Above Nangling’s Shigui Village, Luo Tian’s ear turned red. He sneezed loudly, causing the villagers to glance curiously.

“Who’s thinking of me? I’m sure my family is worried!” Luo Tian smiled, his mood elated. Who wouldn’t be happy after returning from the dead?

“First, deal with this matter!” Luo Tian’s gaze swept over Shigui Village. His eyes softened as he saw the twenty who had died, but his killing intent rose gradually.

“Such a lowly Sage Peak dares to attack me!” Luo Tian’s face darkened. He extended his foot, stomping down on Man Zhen’s massive body.

“How is this possible!” Man Zhen was terrified beyond measure. He had never imagined Luo Tian’s flesh could be so strong. In their realm, humans stood no chance against the Man tribe—this was an iron law of the Man tribe.

Conversely, human cultivation was pure and refined; their martial arts were far superior to the Man tribe’s. If distant, human martial arts could turn the tide.

But Luo Tian exceeded Man Zhen’s comprehension. Though he was Half-Era, his flesh was beyond human limits—his strength defied all norms.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s slender body shot like a meteor, landing on Man Zhen’s chest. The massive chest caved in, ribs jutting out grotesquely.

“Chu Chen!” Luo Tian gazed at Chu Chen, his eyes questioning. Though he had recovered memories, he knew what was happening outside. Man Zhen was his father, and Luo Tian could not ignore Chu Chen’s feelings—otherwise, that kick would have ended Man Zhen.

“Chu Chen! I am your father!” Seeing Luo Tian gaze at him, Man Zhen’s face changed. He gritted his teeth against the searing pain in his chest, gazing at Chu Chen with a desperate shout.

“Father!” Chu Chen slowly approached Man Zhen, his eyes filled with sorrow as he gazed at him.

“Did you think of me when you ordered the attack on Shigui Village? Did you consider your son was among them?”

“Good father! For years, have you fulfilled your duty as a parent? I doubt you’d even remember me if not for this village!” Chu Chen’s eyes held a cruel smile as he stood beside Luo Tian, gazing at Man Zhen.

“You!” Man Zhen was speechless, his body trembling. He turned to Luo Tian.

“I am the Lord of Qinghe City of the Man tribe. If you kill me, the Manhun Temple will never forgive you. Are you truly willing to kill me?” Man Zhen invoked the Manhun Temple, seeking a last chance.

“Kill him!” The villagers roared, their eyes burning with hatred. If not for Luo Tian’s arrival, Shigui Village might have already been crushed by those two hundred riders.

Chu Chen opened his mouth but, seeing the villagers’ anger, shook his head and turned away from Luo Tian.

“Sigh…” The chieftain sighed, understanding Chu Chen’s dilemma. One side was his own father, though a fool, who had given him life; the other was Shigui Village that had raised him. This left Chu Chen torn.

Luo Tian felt the same, his golden hand凝聚 and grabbed Man Lie before him.

At this moment, Man Lie was terrified beyond reason, trembling at the sight of Luo Tian’s overwhelming power.

“Everything started because of you! You wanted to kill your own brother—first, die!” Luo Tian’s hand clenched, crushing Man Lie into a mist of blood that scattered across the ground.

“As for you, I’ll spare you this once out of respect for being Chu Chen’s father. If there is a next time, I’ll annihilate you completely!” Luo Tian pointed his finger, golden seals flashing into Man Zhen’s body.

Man Zhen’s face lit with relief at Luo Tian’s words. If he was released, he could report to the Manhun Temple and ensure Luo Tian’s death.

But as golden light entered his body, Man Zhen felt immense tension. He knew humans had many methods; even the strongest in the Manhun Temple could not break these seals.

“Take care of yourself,” Luo Tian raised his foot, signaling Man Zhen to leave.

“Thank you!” Man Zhen gazed at Luo Tian, bowing deeply—a gesture of respect from the Man tribe to a strong opponent.

Chu Chen’s face showed gratitude, gazing at Luo Tian. Though he felt guilt toward Shigui Village, as Luo Tian had thought, Man Zhen was his father.

“Only this once. If there is a next time, I’ll kill you myself!” Chu Chen gazed at Man Zhen with determination.

“Won’t you return to Qinghe City with me?” Man Zhen, seeing Chu Chen’s hatred, trembled.

Chapter 1228: The Past of Shigui Village

“Leave? No, I’ve grown accustomed to life here. I don’t wish to leave!” Chu Chen spoke, his voice tinged with nostalgia as he gazed at Shigui Village’s people.

“Good, Qinghe City will always welcome you,” Man Zhen said with a bitter smile. His massive body slowly rose, walking away from Shigui Village.

After this incident, Man Zhen truly regarded Chu Chen as his son. It was because of Chu Chen’s talent and Luo Tian, a Half-Era strength who ranked among the strongest in the Manhun Temple.

“Thank you, Luo Tian!” The chieftain and villagers said nothing more. It was Luo Tian who had saved Shigui Village; whether Man Zhen lived or died was up to Luo Tian.

“You’re too kind, chieftain. If not for Shigui Village, I might have been taken by a beast!” Luo Tian quickly replied, bowing to the chieftain. Earlier, the old man had spoken of burning everything with them, making Luo Tian suspect Shigui Village was more complex than he thought. Especially the old man’s bone staff, which made Luo Tian feel a deep sense of caution.

“This is the ancestral weapon passed down by our Stone Clan!” The chieftain, noticing Luo Tian’s gaze on his bone staff, explained.

“Go clean the battlefield. I have something to say with Luo Tian!” The chieftain ordered others, indicating Luo Tian follow him.

Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly. He also had questions for the chieftain and followed him with Chu Chen into the village’s back hills.

Their pace was swift, and soon they reached an ancient courtyard. The place felt desolate, as if long abandoned, making Luo Tian’s eyes flicker with confusion.

Yet he was surprised to find the courtyard suited human-sized dwellings, not giants’. This intrigued Luo Tian.

“Chieftain, did humans ever come to Shigui Village?” Luo Tian asked, gazing at the courtyard.

“Long ago, our village was once prosperous. A Sage Peak strength appeared here and even held a place in the Manhun City!”

“But times change. Even the most glorious races fall in this land of might. When I was young, our clan moved to Nangling and fell into decline,” the chieftain said with a nostalgic look.

“My name is Shi Changshan, and I am the oldest in Shigui Village. Only I know our clan’s past glory,” Shi Changshan continued, lost in memories.

“It was when I was young. Our clan had just moved to Nangling, expelled from Manhun City. The village was in despair but still had a Sage Peak elder. Thus, no one dared to bully us. One night, thunder and lightning struck. A small figure fell into our village—our elder found him and saved him!”

“That was a human strength, severely wounded. Though Man and humans were enemies, our elder decided to save him. He spent three months nursing him back to health!”

“No surprise, the elder became friends with this human. But it was this human who brought us a great crisis!”

“This human was powerful, also at Sage Peak. He stayed in this village for three months,” Shi Changshan looked at the dilapidated courtyard, continuing.

“Later, this human left and gave us this courtyard and a sword in that room, saying we could seek his help if trouble came.”

“But this sword bore immense pressure. No one could enter that room unless they reached Sage Late-stage. This was a protection for our clan, as entering human lands without Sage Late-stage strength would invite attack. Without it, one would be crushed instantly!”

“After this human left, our disaster came—just like today. But instead of Man Zhen’s low-level strength, it was the Manhun Temple’s elite. Three Sage Peak strengths came and slaughtered Shigui Village, capturing our elder to Manhun City!” Shi Changshan’s face was bitter as he finished the story.

Luo Tian and Chu Chen were speechless, stunned to learn Shigui Village had once hosted a Sage Peak strength.

But soon, Luo Tian realized: Shigui Village was no ordinary village. The ancient formula for body refinement and the one that restored his memories were beyond common villages.

“Respected elder, if you need help, please say so!” Luo Tian smiled and addressed the chieftain.

“I hope you find the human elder who once lived in our village when you enter human lands. Tell him about my clan’s elder being captured and ask him to rescue us!” Shi Changshan looked guilty, gazing at Luo Tian.

He had driven Luo Tian away before but now begged him for help, making Shi Changshan’s face red with shame.

“Understood, chieftain. Shigui Village has done me kindness; I will inform the elder when I enter human lands!” Luo Tian smiled. Helping was a small task for him, and he would even seek the elder for Shigui Village.

But when Luo Tian heard three Sage Peak strengths were sent to destroy a tiny Shigui Village, he felt a shadow in his heart. After all, the Nine Domains had only two Sage Peak strengths: Biao Yuanshan and Sun Shengtian. Compared to the Man tribe, they were far weaker.

“No wonder Meng Elder said every sealed domain holds a race capable of rivaling the entire Nine Domains!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly. In essence, everyone in the Tenth Domain was a potential enemy of the Nine Domains.

“This sword is unsuitable for us Man tribe. Take it as payment for Shigui Village!” Shi Changshan ordered Luo Tian, pushing open the courtyard door.

“Buzz…” As the three entered the courtyard, a terrifying sword aura surged over them. Shi Changshan and Chu Chen immediately stepped back, but only Luo Tian remained.

“Excellent sword!” Just sensing this aura, Luo Tian knew it was at least a High-Grade Sacred-level longsword.

“Good, I don’t have a suitable weapon now. A good longsword is nice!” Luo Tian smiled, stepping into the courtyard’s dilapidated room despite the sword aura.

As he pushed open the door, golden light pierced his eyes. A golden blade shot toward him instantly.

“Crash…” The golden sword pierced Luo Tian’s flesh, sinking several inches before he blocked it.

“Hm?” Luo Tian raised his brows, a hint of joy in his eyes. Golden blood flowed from the wound.

“Pseudo-Era Treasure?” Luo Tian mused. Ordinary Sacred weapons could not harm him; only a Pseudo-Era Treasure could wound him when unprepared.

“Good, this human elder was generous to leave a Pseudo-Era Treasure for the Man tribe!” Luo Tian nodded, grabbing the hilt.

“Buzz…” As he held it, the golden sword hummed violently in his hand, resisting.

“Don’t resist. You won’t escape my grasp!” Luo Tian tightened his grip, subduing the sword with Half-Era strength. He used his other hand to stroke the blade, coating it with golden blood.

Bloodline power spread, and in an instant, the blood was absorbed into the sword. The powerful bloodline energy instantly infiltrated the blade.

“Buzz…” Golden light flared, and the sword trembled violently in Luo Tian’s hand. But soon, its resistance faded, and it lay still in his grasp.

“Pfft… you can’t beat me!” Luo Tian smirked, then lightly swung the sword. Its sharpness sliced through space, cutting a gray hole in the room that quickly healed.

“Fast…” Luo Tian frowned slightly, sensing the difference between this Man tribe land and the Nine Domains.

If he had slashed here in the Nine Domains, it would have torn open space. But on this Man tribe land, space seemed more stable.

“Leaving this Man tribe land isn’t easy,” Luo Tian frowned inwardly, sighing at the difference between the Tenth Domain and Nine Domains. He couldn’t appear anywhere outside his domain at will.

“Is this the work of the Celestial Master?” Luo Tian marveled at the Celestial Master’s power. He had sealed an entire star domain and even influenced its rules.

Luo Tian glanced at the room’s furnishings, noticing a bone on the table that belonged to a Sage-level beast. It caught his attention, and he approached it.

“Sage-level beast bone?” Luo Tian picked up the bone, then noticed characters carved into it.

Chapter 1229: Leaving Shigui Village

In the dim stone room, Luo Tian held a Sage-level beast bone. Though aged, it still glimmered like jade, radiating divine laws.

“Words!” He noticed small characters carved into the bone, drawing his attention.

“Shigui Village friends, if you’ve entered this room, it means you have reached Sage Late-stage. Though I am human, I deeply appreciate your kindness. We spoke at length, but eventually, I had to leave. This Endless Sword is my gift to you!”

“This Endless Sword accompanied me for most of my life. Though the Man tribe cannot use it, it is a Pseudo-Era Treasure. I’ve left the Endless Sword Technique for your clan’s fortunate one. May Shigui Village grow stronger and regain its former glory!” The characters filled Luo Tian’s vision.

“Endless Sword? Endless Sword Technique?” Luo Tian smiled, recalling the technique. The more he read, the more amazed he was by this human elder’s talent.

“Excellent! This Endless Sword Technique rivals the last strike of the Seven Demon Blades!” Luo Tian marveled, imprinting the technique into his mind. He planned to master it on his journey to human lands.

With the sword in hand, Luo Tian stepped outside the room and bowed thrice to the stone house. After all, he had taken their belongings and learned their technique.

“Luo Tian, how is it? This is what’s inside the stone house?” As Luo Tian stepped out, Shi Changshan and Chu Chen approached him. They gazed at the sword in his hand with admiration.

Shi Changshan had once let Shigui Village’s people try to enter the stone house, but all failed.

“Yes, a Pseudo-Era Treasure. It’s quite good. If you wish to reclaim it, I’ll return it,” Luo Tian offered the sword to Shi Changshan, his expression indifferent.

Luo Tian’s body strength was comparable to a Pseudo-Era Treasure. With this Endless Sword, it would be an added advantage—nothing more.

“Never mind. This sword is unsuitable for us!” Shi Changshan shook his head. The Endless Sword was too small, thinner than his finger; how could giants use it?

“Then I’ll keep it,” Luo Tian nodded, slinging the sword over his back. He continued: “Elder, can you tell me about this star domain?”

“Good. Let’s sit and talk,” Shi Changshan agreed, and the three returned to Shi Changshan’s courtyard. They spoke until late at night, and only then did Luo Tian and Chu Chen depart.

Shi Changshan shared much with Luo Tian: the power structures of the Man tribe land, the forces in Manhun City, the strength of the Manhun Temple, and other ancient royal families. He told Luo Tian everything he knew.

“Boom…” Chu Chen’s foot stomped on Shigui Village’s road, his shoulder bearing Luo Tian. His face held a gentle expression as he gazed at the tranquil village. He truly envied these people’s lives.

“When do you plan to leave?” Chu Chen asked, his voice deep and thunderous in Luo Tian’s ears.

“Tomorrow. The later I leave, the more dangerous it is for Shigui Village,” Luo Tian replied, patting Chu Chen’s shoulder habitually.

“Hm.” Chu Chen paused, then walked back to his quarters.

“Alright, don’t be like a woman. Train well. Perhaps we’ll meet again,” Luo Tian said. He didn’t know if Man Zhen could be trusted, so he added: “Shigui Village should relocate. This place is too unsafe.”

“Understood. I’ll tell the chieftain,” Chu Chen nodded, entering the stone house.

They said nothing more that night. The next morning, Luo Tian took out a purple feather given by the Purple Lightning Bird and lit it. He needed the bird to guide him to Seven Star Island.

“Chu Chen, remember: relocate this place!” Luo Tian repeatedly warned Chu Chen before leaving.

“Understood. Take care, and if you have time, come visit Nangling!” Chu Chen smiled awkwardly. He knew they might never meet again.

“Crack…” A purple lightning streaked across the sky, and the Purple Lightning Bird’s massive body appeared over Shigui Village. Purple lightning crackled around it.

“It’s the Purple Lightning Bird! How did it come to our village!” The villagers gazed at it with surprise.

“Is he leaving?” Shi Changshan looked at Luo Tian on Chu Chen’s shoulder, his face filled with regret.

“Yes! Goodbye, chieftain! Goodbye to all of you!” Luo Tian smiled and waved at the villagers, slinging the Endless Sword over his back and leaping onto the Purple Lightning Bird’s back.

“Goodbye, Luo Tian! We’ll remember you!” The villagers shouted at him.

“Go!” Luo Tian commanded the bird, leaving with a touch of Shigui Village’s warmth.

“Directly?” The Purple Lightning Bird’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind. He felt the change in Luo Tian compared to days ago—his aura had become immeasurable and deeper.

“No, first take me to Qinghe City. Return for me three days later!” Luo Tian’s gaze flashed with coldness. He still had doubts, so he planned to infiltrate Qinghe City for a look.
