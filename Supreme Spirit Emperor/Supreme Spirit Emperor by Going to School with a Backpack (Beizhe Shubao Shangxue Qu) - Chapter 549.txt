Chapter 2097: Chaos

“Move aside! Don’t think because you’re from the Reincarnation Sect, I won’t kill you!” Wang Lie’s eyes burned with madness. Others dared not harm the Reincarnation Sect, but he had no such hesitation—his father was the Beast Ghost King, and even the Reincarnation Sect would yield to him.

“Not moving!” The young man wielded a long staff, clashing with Wang Lie’s ghost sword.

Wang Lie was formidable; to Lu Tian, he surpassed Luo Bai. The young man was no pushover either—though his status within the Reincarnation Sect was low, his strength was formidable. The clash of weapons echoed as he blocked Wang Lie’s advance through the barrier.

Boom… Boom…

At that moment, two more resounding explosions echoed. Yan Shu and Chen Tianzhou also broke through the barrier, witnessing Wang Lie’s duel.

“Go!” In an instant, they ignored everything else and rushed toward the thirty-sixth barrier.

“Where’s that kid? Why hasn’t he left yet!” The remaining figures on the altar grew anxious, leaping down two more disciples who materialized before Yan Shu and Chen Tianzhou.

“Get out of the way!” They roared, launching into a frenzy of attacks against each other.

“Fascinating,” Lu Tian sat cross-legged, watching the six combatants locked in battle, his eyes alight with amusement.

“Lu Chen, why haven’t you left yet!” The two descending disciples bellowed, their voices laced with fury.

“Severely wounded—I can’t stand!” Lu Tian chuckled, shaking his head as he waved a hand, releasing Erhei.

Upon emerging, Erhei did not flee but stood alert, adopting a defensive stance as he observed the six combatants.

“Go—devour all those barriers and let everyone in!” Lu Tian commanded Erhei, his tone cold.

At the twenty-second barrier, they had obstructed him; he endured. At the thirty-fifth, they had again blocked him, even wounding him. This time, Lu Tian could not endure—he would make them understand that some people were beyond their reach.

“Woof!” Erhei’s eyes gleamed with greed as he barked twice but did not leave.

“Don’t worry, I have Dahei here,” Lu Tian felt a warmth in his chest. He knew Erhei was concerned for his safety, so he gently patted Erhei’s head.

“Woof…” Erhei let out a sound, then soared into the air toward the thirty-first barrier, vanishing from sight.

Erhei’s speed was terrifying; he reached the thirty-first barrier in an instant, where a trial candidate was desperately striking it.

“Woof!” Erhei barked, then lunged forward, swallowing the barrier that the youth had been attacking.

“What’s going on!” The youth barely managed to react before his barrier vanished, leaving only a streak of black light and the echo of a dog’s bark.

“Move!” The youth’s face lit up with joy, charging toward the remaining transparent thirty-second barrier.

“Damn it, that’s that dead dog!” A disciple of the Reincarnation Sect on the altar grimaced.

Twenty-eighth… Twenty-seventh…
Within half a bell, Erhei devoured two more barriers. The Reincarnation Sect disciples on the altar paled in fear.

“We must stop that dead dog!”
“No—just expel Lu Tian, and everything will be fine!” They exchanged glances, their gazes turning toward Lu Tian on the curtain.

“I’ll go!”
“Who among you? Wang Lie is strong; Zhao Senior might not hold out!”
Two more youths leaped from the altar, appearing in the hall. One rushed toward Wang Lie, while another headed for Lu Tian.

“Lu Chen, why haven’t you left!” The youth roared, his voice thick with anger. He had a sense that something momentous was about to unfold.

“I’m severely wounded—I can’t move!” Lu Tian chuckled, having recovered two-thirds of his strength. Yet he knew he was no match for the youth at this moment.

“Why are you hesitating? Just finish him!” The two blocking Wang Lie barked, their voices rising. In mere moments, ten barriers had been devoured by Erhei. If this continued, the hall would be left with no barriers except those borrowed by Zhang Tianhe. The thought of this dire outcome made all hearts tremble—this was the first time in years they had faced such a crisis. The hall was a treasure of the Reincarnation Sect, each barrier a vital component of its power. Devoured by Erhei, it would surely cause catastrophe.

“Damn it, Zhang Tianhe’s power was so immense earlier! Now I can’t move!” The youth cursed inwardly, though his face remained cold.

“I’ll have to send you out then!” The youth sneered, launching himself toward Lu Tian.

“Xiaohai! No—Dahei! Bite him!” Lu Tian chuckled, waving a hand. A massive black dog materialized before him.

“Roar…” The black hound appeared, instantly dashing toward the youth, its eyes flashing with ferocity. Upon arrival, it grew to over half a man’s height but bore no third head.

“Another one!” The youth’s mouth twitched as the altar’s people shuddered.

“Is he a dog breeder?” All felt an instinctive sense of that.

“You’re asking for death!” The youth formed a hand seal, summoning a black seal that descended from the sky to crush the three-headed hound. He continued charging toward Lu Tian.

“Boom…” Dust and smoke erupted, the black seal sweeping forward. The youth believed this strike would crush the hound.

But he underestimated the three-headed dog. Since entering Hell, it had trained relentlessly; recently, it had assisted Erhei in sweeping through nearly nine cities of ghostly creatures. Its strength had now advanced to the Mid-True Immortal stage, even surpassing Lu Tian’s.

Amidst the dust, a streak of black lightning shot forth. Dahei appeared before the youth, its maw snapping shut on his thigh.

“Ah…” The youth screamed, unprepared for the attack. This bite nearly severed his leg. He slapped the hound’s body with a palm.

“Boom…” The youth’s hand trembled in pain, but the hound remained unscathed, tearing away flesh from his thigh.

“Run…” The youth retreated, staring at the exposed white bone of his leg. He nearly wept in agony as Dahei lunged toward him.

The hall erupted into chaos—while one side fought, the youth was chased by the three-headed dog, leaving no time to attend to Lu Tian. Dahei’s speed was terrifying; even in desperation, the youth was pursued relentlessly.

This delay allowed Erhei to devour the remaining barriers, leaving only the thirty-fifth barrier intact.

“Done for!” The altar’s people paled, gazing at the final two barriers with dread. If they returned to the Reincarnation Sect, they would face punishment.

As Erhei devoured the last barrier, the four ghost beast statues outside the hall changed—their former luster dimmed.

“Huh? Why have the four ghost beast kings weakened so much?” People furrowed their brows, gazing at the lifeless statues, murmuring among themselves.

“Why?” Lin Dong’s eyes also showed confusion. He had used this hall before, but this was the first time he’d seen such a phenomenon.

Yet now, the hall was sealed; he could not force it open. He could only wait, a bad premonition stirring in his heart.

Dozens of people stood outside the thirty-fifth barrier, their faces alight with joy. These were the trial participants; without barriers, they had all gathered here.

“Truly blessed by heaven!” Their eyes gleamed with joy, though they didn’t know what had transpired. They knew this was their chance.

“Thanks to that divine hound! Without it, we wouldn’t have reached here!” They felt gratitude.

“Woof…” As they struggled to open the thirty-fifth barrier, a dog’s bark echoed in their ears, causing all faces to brighten with joy.

“Buzz…” The black barrier twisted and vanished from sight. They witnessed the final barrier’s scene—Wang Lie and three others clashing, while a youth was chased by the three-headed dog.

This had all transpired in mere moments; even those on the altar were still dazed when all barriers vanished.

“Damn it! The barriers are destroyed. If we don’t complete the task, I’ll be severely punished upon returning!” The altar’s people leapt down.

“Charge!” Dozens roared, their eyes ablaze with excitement, rushing toward the final barrier. Though few in number, they radiated overwhelming momentum. Meanwhile, those remaining on the altar also appeared within the hall, their faces grim and hearts seething.

These barriers were all ruined by Lu Tian, yet now they had to protect him, allowing him to succeed and become a disciple of the Reincarnation Sect.

“Lu Chen, how do you plan to exit the barrier!” They roared, instantly blocking those charging forward.

At the same time, besides the youth chased by the three-headed dog, the four others fighting Wang Lie also returned to their ranks.

Chapter 2098: Extortion

“Deploy the Reincarnation Array!” A voice rang out, hands summoning dark energy that converged above their heads. They had no choice; though they could fight two against one, sometimes a single escapee would break through the barrier, and failure was inevitable.

“Blame Zhang Tianhe! If not for him, this wouldn’t have happened!” Thirty-plus people seethed.

Dark energy coalesced above their heads, forming a river of black mist that flowed before them. It shifted to yellow—the color of the River of Hell.

Wang Lie and his group halted, their eyes wide with horror at the yellow river before them.

“Lu Chen, how do you plan to exit the barrier!” They roared, their voices laced with fury. The feeling of being betrayed while still protecting the betrayer left them enraged.

“Kill!” Wang Lie bellowed, his sword slicing downward at the yellow river.

“Rippling…!” The yellow water surged, black energy piercing it and causing a ripple before vanishing.

“Kill…” Yan Shu and Chen Tianzhou also attacked, their bodies radiating madness as they hurled martial arts toward the yellow river.

The water churned, waves rising—thirty-five people paled but remained standing.

“I’m severely wounded—I can’t stand!” Lu Tian spoke softly, recalling the three-headed dog. Two black dogs stood beside him; Erhei was nearly spherical now.

“Why are these people so foolish? I’ve hinted so clearly!” Lu Tian muttered, watching the thirty-plus Reincarnation Sect disciples.

“You’ve recovered so long—can’t you stand?” Thirty-five people roared, their anger boiling.

“Dear seniors of the Reincarnation Sect, please grant me some healing items. Then I’ll have strength to stand!” Lu Tian sighed deeply, feeling they were as foolish as ever.

“Blackmail…”
“They’re extorting us!” Thirty-plus people realized Lu Tian’s intent, their faces darkening with anger.

“Lu Chen, don’t be so ungrateful! We’ve overlooked your barrier destruction—yet you’re extorting us!” A youth bellowed.

At that moment, they regretted their actions. They hadn’t anticipated Lu Tian would refuse to exit the barrier. If they had reacted sooner, sending a few people to kick him out, there would be no such trouble.

Even with the two black dogs, they couldn’t withstand them. But now it was too late; if they sent one person, they couldn’t expel Lu Tian. If they sent more, the Reincarnation Array’s power would weaken, possibly allowing Wang Lie to break through.

Even so, if time passed, the array would be broken. They had thirty-five people, while Wang Lie’s group had dozens—double their number. Though their strength might not match, they were now on the defensive.

“Then I have no choice but to wait for my wounds to heal a little more,” Lu Tian shook his head, saying nothing further.

“Lu Chen, if you don’t exit, your life in the Reincarnation Sect won’t be easy. If you leave now, we’ll pretend nothing happened!”

“Hurry up and go!” Thirty-plus people shouted repeatedly, wishing to devour Lu Tian alive. This feeling was too suffocating.

Boom… Boom…
Wang Lie’s attacks grew fiercer, and they heard Lu Tian’s dialogue with the Reincarnation Sect disciples. Their minds were stunned yet impressed by Lu Tian’s audacity—extorting the Reincarnation Sect openly, something they wouldn’t dare.

“Greedy!” Their mental label of Lu Tian added another trait.

Yet they were also delighted, fighting harder because it was Lu Tian’s greed that gave them an opportunity.

They now sensed the yellow river weakening—after a little more attack, they could break through the Reincarnation Sect’s blockade.

“Damn it… just a little longer, and we’ll collapse!” The Reincarnation Sect disciples seethed, their hearts bursting with frustration.

“Should’ve never messed with this bastard!”
“Is it really necessary to compromise?” Thirty-plus people exchanged silent thoughts, eventually choosing to compromise. Thirty-five of them waved their hands, and thirty-five lower-grade ghost weapons flew toward Lu Tian.

“Is this enough!” A youth bellowed, his voice thick with anger and frustration. They had been tricked by Lu Tian yet still protected him, even giving him gifts—this made them nearly insane.

“Treating us like beggars?” Lu Tian’s eyes flashed with disdain; he had no interest in those ghost weapons.

“Seniors, we’re all part of the same sect. I’m injured—weapons are useless to me. Give me some immortal-reviving pills, and I’ll take them!” Lu Tian addressed them.

“Damn it…”
“They’re all we have!” Thirty-five people cursed inwardly; immortal-reviving pills? They didn’t even possess them, and if they did, they’d hoard them.

“Then I have no choice but to sit here and recover my wounds,” Lu Tian sighed, ignoring the lower-grade ghost weapons on the ground. These weren’t trash to him—his storage ring was overflowing with such items.

“Lu Chen!” Thirty-five people gritted their teeth, but Lu Tian’s refusal left them powerless.

They waved their hands again; this time, a mountain of black crystals fell before Lu Tian—ghost crystals, the currency of Hell. This pile was worth a million, a fortune for a True Immortal at the early stage.

“Not enough!” Lu Tian smirked, though a million ghost crystals were substantial, they meant nothing to him. The Luo family could easily provide more.

“Ungrateful!” Seeing Lu Tian still not moving, they understood fully—Lu Tian was a bottomless pit.

They exchanged glances again; this time, they sent millions of ghost crystals. Though it pained them, Lu Tian still showed no intention of standing, driving them mad. They even felt the urge to let Wang Lie’s group through but restrained themselves.

“Haha, Lu Chen, sit there for a moment longer, and I’ll give you an upper-grade ghost weapon!” Wang Lie laughed, addressing Lu Tian.

Hearing this, Lu Tian’s eyes flickered with light. He calculated quickly and slowly stood: “Seniors’ treasures are indeed divine! I’ve recovered some strength—I can stand now.”

Lu Tian waved a hand, collecting the mountain of ghost crystals and thirty-plus lower-grade weapons.

“Ancestors! Please hurry out!” The thirty-five Reincarnation Sect disciples’ eyes lit with excitement. They waved their hands again, and millions of ghost crystals fell before Lu Tian.

“Lu Chen, if you don’t leave, I’ll double the offer!” Yan Shu and Chen Tianzhou also spoke.

“Seriously? I’m not well-educated, but you won’t deceive me!” Lu Tian smiled.

“Of course!” Wang Lie and others roared, waving a hand to summon ghost crystals before them.

“Why are you still here? Don’t you want to enter the Reincarnation Sect!” Wang Lie barked at the dozens.

“Rippling…” Hearing Wang Lie’s words, others gritted their teeth and released their ghost crystals. If they lacked them, they exchanged treasures or elixirs.

“See? Lu Chen, if you don’t leave, all this is yours!” Wang Lie roared, resuming his attack on the yellow river.

“Erhei! Go fetch those things for me!” Lu Tian smiled, addressing Erhei.

“Woof…” The three-headed dog and Erhei barked twice before streaking out of the yellow river as lightning.

“Even the Reincarnation Array couldn’t stop them!” The hall’s people trembled.

“What are these two dogs?!” Their faces bore confusion, sensing that Lu Tian’s dogs might be his greatest strength.

The two fat dogs quickly carried the treasures released by Wang Lie’s group to Lu Tian.

“Alas… such a dilemma!” Lu Tian sighed, sitting again and gazing at the Reincarnation Sect disciples.

“Damn fool!” The Reincarnation Sect disciples seethed; this was the first time they’d seen someone exploit such an opportunity to demand treasures. Others had competed fiercely for entry into the Reincarnation Sect, but this man used it to demand gifts.

“We’ll give more—hurry up and leave!” Thirty-five people had no choice but to throw out more treasures.

“We’ll double it!” Two groups were frustrated, continuously throwing treasures toward Lu Tian—some wanted him to leave quickly; others wished he’d stay.

“Finally, you’ve come to your senses!” Lu Tian smiled, and the two fat dogs worked busily. Lu Tian also began collecting treasures from the ground.

Half a bell passed; all faces bore fury—Wang Lie’s group was no exception, as Lu Tian had made them envious. Worse still, those treasures were their own.

“Enough! Do as you please!” They roared, their hearts filled with resentment. Lu Tian was a bottomless pit, accepting everything offered.

They had no more to give; those treasures were their life-saving items.
