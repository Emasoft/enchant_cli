Time passed slowly, three days slipped by in the blink of an eye. The news of Luo Tian and his companions arriving at Slaughter City spread like wildfire, igniting a storm across the city.
All of Slaughter City's inhabitants first felt greed, even its senior elders harbored the desire to detain Luo Tian and seize the immortal herb seed.
However, Yan Hongtao, the city's ruler, issued an order: during Luo Tian's stay in Slaughter City, no one was to attack him. Those who did would face severe punishment, instantly extinguishing the fire of ambition in people's hearts.
In a luxurious mansion, a young man sat with an expression of indulgence, while a young attendant stood beside him, her attire disheveled and eyes dazed. Another attendant massaged his shoulders from behind.
"Such is the situation!" An old man, seemingly oblivious to the sensual scene before him, spoke with reverence, recounting Luo Tian's arrival.
"Ah..." The young man trembled violently, exhaling a long breath before pushing the attendant away.
"Yan Hongtao said not to attack that boy?" The young man opened his eyes, a glint of amusement in his gaze as he asked.
"Indeed. But Luo Tian is no easy opponent—he's slain a royal heir and nearly killed the heirs of both the Divine Clan and the Demon Clan. His entourage includes three masters who have withstood the ancient royal clans!" The old man replied.
"Hmph. If others can't act, I will. What's a single immortal herb seed? It's an irresistible prize! Yan Hongtao even refuses it! As for those so-called masters of the ancient royal clans, all nonsense!" The young man's lips curled into a smirk.
"Moreover, I heard he brought a wife of unparalleled beauty?" The young man inquired, his gaze filled with greed.
The old man said nothing but waved his hand, and golden light cascaded forth, revealing a woman's visage in the hall—Sun Mengru, who had accompanied Luo Tian into Slaughter City.
"This woman is no ordinary soul; she was once a Divine Clan's celestial maiden, her body type unparalleled—One of the Nine Celestial Bodies, the Primordial Divine Body!" The old man's eyes gleamed with amusement. He knew that once the young man saw this image, he would surely act.
"Truly exquisite... a waste!" The young man's face lit up as he gazed upon Sun Mengru's portrait, his fists clenching tightly. "I shall claim Sun Mengru!"
"Go—send Yan Tian Gong and Yan Tian Han to probe that boy's strength. If the opportunity arises, eliminate him immediately. Tell them I'll reward them handsomely if successful; even if they fail, I'll bear the consequences!" The young man's face darkened with coldness before he sprawled himself, but upon seeing the attendant's fervent efforts and recalling Sun Mengru's beauty, he grew impatient, shoving her out.
"Yes!" The old man's face lit up with joy as he exited the hall, knowing that under Yan Haobo's protection, many would dare to take risks.
In the courtyard where Luo Tian and his companions resided, Biao Dezu and others lounged with lazy expressions.
"How boring! Let's visit the tomb of the former Slaughter Domain Lord!" Sun Kainian said, his eyes gleaming with mischief. "I've entered the tombs of most sacred domains, but two remain untouched—one is Star Luo Domain, those bastards are treacherous; the other is Slaughter Domain!" Sun Kainian boasted.
"Shut up..." Luo Tian didn't even think, kicking Sun Kainian away with a threatening glare. "Sun Kainian, I warn you—here we are guests. If you cause trouble, I'll skin you!"
"Exactly! We're here to seek help. Do you think Slaughter Domain is so simple? I'll tell you, we lack epoch treasures. If a fight breaks out, we can't hold them!" Biao Dezu and others stomped on Sun Kainian before returning to their seats, scoffing.
"You bastards always take advantage of me! Zheng Xin, you said last night you wanted to see the tombs of Slaughter Domain's lords!" Sun Kainian rose, cursing.
"Luotian, there's news!" But before Sun Kainian's words faded, Yan Hongtao appeared at the gate.
"Did you find something?" Upon hearing Yan Hongtao's words, Luo Tian and his companions tensed, their faces lighting up with joy.
Chapter 1577: Assassination
"Of course! What do you think we're here for?" Yan Hongtao smiled, stepping toward Luo Tian.
"Buzz..." Soon after, a hum resonated behind Luo Tian as two cold glints shot toward him.
The glints moved swiftly, but Luo Tian's face remained calm. His eyes flashed like lightning as he sneered, "Finally couldn't hold back?"
Before Luo Tian's voice faded, the two glints were about to pierce his back. Yet Biao Dezu and others wore mocking expressions, ignoring the attack.
Luo Tian suddenly turned, his fists striking out, intercepting the glints with bare hands. In an instant, two sharp sounds echoed through the hall.
"Go..." A voice echoed in the void as waves rippled across the hall, and the attackers vanished immediately.
"Showing off—trying to flee?" Luo Tian's eyes flashed coldness as he tore through the air, his hands weaving golden seals that凝聚 in the void, crushing the two fleeing figures.
"Dead!" The two old men felt immense pressure from the golden seal, their speed slowing as they fled. Before long, the seals struck them violently.
Blood spewed from their mouths, leaving them weak but still determined to escape. They knew if captured, their fate would be grim.
"Where do you think you're going?" Zheng Xin and Biao Dezu transformed into beams of light, rushing into the void to intercept the two wounded elders.
"Apologies, Luotian. I failed to discipline them!" Yan Hongtao's face bore regret as he spoke softly to Luo Tian.
"It's fine," Luo Tian shook his head. Though in Slaughter Domain and Yan Hongtao had issued a ban, Luo Tian knew human nature—immortal herb seeds were too precious for anyone to resist.
Thus, these days Luo Tian and his companions appeared relaxed but remained vigilant against Slaughter Domain's attacks. These people were top-tier assassins; a single mistake could lead to disaster.
Therefore, Luo Tian had spread his divine awareness, detecting the two elders as they sneaked into the courtyard and secretly informed Biao Dezu.
The two elders were wounded by Luo Tian's Sundering Heaven Seal and, as assassins, relied on one-hit kills. They couldn't match Biao Dezu and Zheng Xin.
"Boom..." Soon after, the courtyard's sky thundered as two battered figures fell before Luo Tian.
"Yan Tian Gong, Yan Tian Han!" Recognizing the two elders, Yan Hongtao's face darkened. They were Slaughter Domain's senior elders who had recently ascended to the Epoch Peak.
"Your audacity is astounding! Did you take my words as wind?" Yan Hongtao's face was furious, slapping the two elders' faces.
"Spit..." The elders' blood spewed again upon being struck.
"City Lord, mercy!" Yan Tian Gong and Yan Tian Han, though severely wounded, remained conscious, kneeling to beg for mercy. They knew Yan Hongtao's cruelty; his reign as city lord was not just due to strength but also ruthless tactics.
"Luotian, I apologize for this. These two old men are guilty of death. I'll kill them now!" Yan Hongtao's face was cold, his blood-crimson blade appearing as he slashed toward the two.
"Master's help!" The elders cried out to the sky, but their cries were cut short as the blade veered and pierced the ground beneath them.
A figure in a blood robe entered the courtyard, accompanied by two elders, their aura radiating power.
"Is it you?" Yan Hongtao's face darkened, his gaze icy.
"City Lord, though these two broke your order, their crime isn't death!" Yan Haobo smiled, entering the courtyard. His eyes swept over Luo Tian's group before settling on Sun Mengru, his expression flickering with admiration.
"Yan Haobo, what's your intent?" Yan Hongtao spoke softly. His identity was sensitive; since awakening, Yan Hongtao had treated him with courtesy, even overlooking his transgressions.
"Yan Haobo?" Seeing Yan Haobo's lustful gaze toward Sun Mengru, Luo Tian felt a surge of killing intent.
"An heir of the Epoch Lord?" Yet Luo Tian didn't lash out immediately; he had heard of Yan Haobo and understood him.
Yan Haobo's greatest reputation was arrogance and lust. Since awakening, he had taken multiple women in his mansion, but his self-confidence was justified—being an heir of the Epoch Lord and possessing the Slaughter Body, one of the Nine Human Bodies.
"City Lord, grant me a favor and let these two live," Yan Haobo smiled, addressing Yan Hongtao.
"Yan Haobo, since your awakening, I've always protected you. Even when you raped a senior elder's daughter and killed her, I covered it up. Now you attack my guests—do you truly have no respect for me?" Yan Hongtao's voice was furious.
"Ugh, I didn't expect the Epoch Lord's heir to be such a scoundrel!" Biao Dezu and others scoffed, their gazes on Yan Haobo.
"City Lord, if I insist on saving them?"
"Moreover, today's Luotian—I claim him. Immortal herb seeds are precious; they've come to me—how could I refuse?" Yan Haobo's face was contemptuous as he gazed at Yan Hongtao, then scrutinized Sun Mengru.
"Little beauty, your husband is doomed. You'll become a widow. Join me; I promise you ecstasy!" Yan Haobo's greed was evident as he spoke, assuming Luo Tian would die.
"Don't provoke death—don't die!" Biao Dezu and others didn't back down.
"Ugh, is Yan Haobo your son? Did your father also run around seducing women and accidentally left a child behind?" Xu Liyi laughed.
"He's not even worthy of being your son! I bet his mother abandoned him and raised the placenta!" Zheng Xin added.
"I don't think so. He's a freak—born naturally. I guess his father was fighting himself and accidentally planted him in the ground. This kid grew through sheer willpower. Honestly, he's not easy!" Sun Kainian, joining the others, had mastered a venomous tongue.
Zheng Xin, Xu Liyi, Biao Dezu, Yan Jun, and Sun Kainian cursed Yan Haobo like a barrage of fireworks, each with unique insults.
Sun Mengru's face turned red; though she'd heard their curses before, they always came up with fresh, vulgar remarks.
"You're seeking death!" Yan Haobo, despite his many mouths, couldn't match these curse masters. His face darkened as blood seemed to drip from it. He raised his hands, emitting waves of crimson aura and a surge of killing intent.
"Boom..." As Yan Haobo's killing intent rose, a blood mist erupted and was instantly incinerated by seven-colored flames.
"Did you say you'd kill me?" Luo Tian smiled, his gaze on Yan Haobo. Yet the coldness in his smile froze the air around them.
"You dare kill my people before me?" Yan Haobo's face showed slight tension; though arrogant and lustful, he wasn't a fool. From Luo Tian's attack, he knew he was an enemy.
"Did you say you'd kill me?" Luo Tian spoke softly, then stomped on Yan Tian Gong.
Another blood mist rose as the seven-colored flames devoured Yan Tian Gong's flesh and soul. His agonized cries echoed through the courtyard.
"Die!" Yan Haobo, seeing this, vanished and reappeared before Luo Tian, his fist wrapped in blood-crimson seals.
"Who dies is uncertain!" Luo Tian's killing intent surged; he had also unleashed his fierce will against Yan Haobo.
Chapter 1578: Slaughter Arena
"Buzz..." A blood-crimson figure appeared before Luo Tian, his arms swirling with crimson seals like venomous snakes.
"Divine Seal of Demon Subjugation!" Luo Tian roared, his white fist flashing forward and colliding with Yan Haobo's.
"Boom..." The thunderous sound shook the air as wild waves erupted from their clash.
"Crash..." The courtyard, protected by a formation, collapsed as dust swirled.
"What's happening?" Slaughter City's people were stunned. For years, they'd never seen such a scene; Slaughter City had a rule: no fighting within the city. Private disputes must be resolved in the Slaughter Arena, where combat was unrestricted.
"Ah! It's the courtyard of Luo Tian and his companions!" The Slaughter Domain people recognized it, confusion in their eyes.
"Did someone defy the city lord's order and attack Luo Tian?" They murmured.
"Never mind, let's check!" Soon, Slaughter City's people rushed toward Luo Tian's courtyard.
Not only the youth but even the elders appeared around Luo Tian.
"Stumble..." Luo Tian's body retreated, surprise on his face as he gazed at Yan Haobo, who also stepped back. Though their brief clash seemed uneventful, it had stunned Luo Tian.
"Even with his body's strength, he didn't fall behind!" Biao Dezu and others were astonished, watching both men retreat the same distance.
"This must be Luo Tian's strongest enemy since entering the Epoch Peak!" Sun Mengru sighed, admiration in her eyes.
"Indeed, this heir of the Epoch Lord is formidable—truly worthy of his arrogance!" Biao Dezu and others whispered, their gazes on Luo Tian, concern rising.
Yan Haobo also possessed a unique body type, and Luo Tian's Reincarnation Body advantage was minimal. Yan Haobo, as an heir of the Epoch Lord, had no inferiority to Luo Tian; they stood on equal footing.
"Stop! You two are trying to destroy Slaughter City!" Yan Hongtao scolded, watching the growing crowd.
"Ah! It's Yan Haobo. I wondered who dared defy the city lord and attack Luo Tian. Only Yan Haobo would dare and have the strength!" The people looked at Yan Haobo with reverence.
"But I really want to kill him! Can you stop me?" Yan Haobo gazed at Luo Tian, his words arrogant but his gaze serious.
"Coincidence! I also want to kill you!" Luo Tian clenched his fists, gazing at Yan Haobo. When Yan Haobo coveted Sun Mengru, he was on Luo Tian's kill list.
Luo Tian's trigger was his loved ones; anyone daring to harm them would face his wrath. Anyone who gazed at his wife, especially openly, would provoke a man with blood in his veins.
"Want to fight a life-or-death battle?" Yan Haobo smirked, gazing at Luo Tian. He knew Luo Tian wouldn't refuse.
"Are you sure?" Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Slaughter City's people.
"Confident enough," Yan Haobo nodded, gazing at Yan Hongtao.
"Open the Slaughter Arena!" Yan Haobo spoke softly, as if it were trivial.
"Indeed, my Slaughter City's Epoch Lord's heir—facing Luo Tian with such arrogance!" The Slaughter Domain people, hearing Yan Haobo's words, looked at him with admiration. After all, Yan Haobo was part of Slaughter Domain, while Luo Tian was an outsider.
Killers had no feelings for themselves or others; they naturally sided with Yan Haobo over Luo Tian.
"Then, a life-or-death battle! I agree!" Luo Tian nodded, gazing at Yan Hongtao before nodding again.
"Fine," Yan Hongtao sighed, the situation had escalated beyond his control.
"Yan Haobo, be careful! I hope you don't regret it!" Yan Hongtao's face was cold as he spoke.
"Open the Slaughter Arena!" Yan Hongtao gazed at Luo Tian, then shouted to the Slaughter Domain people.
"Boom..." The thunderous sound echoed as the Slaughter Domain people waved their hands, crimson light flying out and painting the sky red.
The light flashed, forming a battlefield above Luo Tian's group, leaving them in awe.
"This Slaughter Arena is itself a formation; your battle must be solid. For ordinary disciples, only part of the people need to act!" Yan Hongtao gazed at Luo Tian, explaining.
"However, the Slaughter Arena has a rule: only one can leave," Yan Hongtao added, speaking softly. "Think carefully."
"Hah! Are you still afraid now?" Yan Haobo sneered, shouting at Luo Tian.
"You can still regret it—kneel and bow three times, then give me that beauty. I'll overlook this and let you go, abandoning the immortal herb seed!"
"Beauty, I've been generous! I gave up killing him, equivalent to abandoning the immortal herb seed, exchanging it for her!" Yan Haobo laughed wildly, looking at Luo Tian with contempt.
"This kid is provoking hatred!" Biao Dezu and others watched Luo Tian's darkening face, knowing Yan Haobo would meet a grim end.
"The more he yells now, the worse his fate will be!" Zheng Xin smirked, arms crossed, looking at Yan Haobo as if he were already dead.
Luo Tian shook his head; this Yan Haobo was now a man marked for death in his eyes.
"I hope you still dare to be arrogant later!" Luo Tian spoke softly, then vanished from the spot, appearing on the battlefield formed by Slaughter City's people.
"Indeed bold! But do you think I was joking?" Yan Haobo roared, landing on the crimson battlefield.
"Buzz..." The red light flashed as crimson seals burst forth, enveloping the sky above Luo Tian and Yan Haobo.
"Interesting, this Slaughter Arena is truly unique!" Luo Tian gazed at the red barrier, admiration in his eyes. He felt he might not escape this battlefield.
"It's too late to regret now!" Yan Haobo's face was cold, no longer speaking. He vanished from the spot.
"Fast!" As Yan Haobo disappeared, Luo Tian took a step, turning slightly and striking a fist into the void.
"Crack..." A crisp sound echoed; Yan Haobo's body appeared before Luo Tian, their fists colliding.
"Boom... Boom..." Their bodies collided, slamming against the crimson barrier.
"Kill!" Luo Tian roared, his body infused with two great techniques, radiating divine light as he rushed toward Yan Haobo.
"Shura Prohibition!" Yan Haobo spoke softly, his eyes flashing coldly as crimson seals wrapped around him, emitting an eerie red glow. His body thundered toward Luo Tian.
Their speed was incredible; even Biao Dezu and others had to watch closely to catch their movements.
One punch... two punches... fists spread around them, thunderous sounds echoing within the barrier.
"Can't see! Their attacks are too fast!" Slaughter City's people looked stunned, hearing only the continuous thunder and the trembling battlefield.
"Truly变态! Even with the Brahman Attack and the One-Over-All technique, Luo Tian couldn't suppress Yan Haobo!" Biao Dezu and others were in awe; this was the first time they'd seen someone match Luo Tian.
"It's Shura Prohibition, a technique that enhances the body!" Yan Hongtao sighed, gazing at Yan Haobo.
"Glory! My Slaughter Domain's Epoch Lord's heir, Yan Haobo, will surely defeat Luo Tian and become the top genius of the nine domains, eventually becoming an Epoch Lord!" The people of Slaughter City shouted, their eyes burning as they watched Yan Haobo clash with Luo Tian.
Luo Tian, the undisputed top genius of the nine domains, now matched Yan Haobo evenly, thrilling Slaughter City's people.
"Truly a formidable opponent!" Luo Tian retreated, his foot landing on the crimson battlefield with a dull thud. His arms trembled slightly as he panted, gazing at Yan Haobo, who also had sweat on his face.
Though only a moment had passed, they'd exchanged nearly a hundred blows with neither gaining the upper hand.
Chapter 1579: Battle Against Yan Haobo
"Seems I must show my true strength!" Luo Tian spoke softly, then bent his body into an odd arc, appearing in the crowd's view like a curved shrimp.
"Haha! What are you doing? Are you trying to beg for mercy? But your direction is off!" Seeing Luo Tian's strange move, Yan Haobo sneered.
"What is he doing?"
"It seems Luo Tian's reputation is undeserved! He's already intimidated by Yan Haobo!" Slaughter City's people sneered, though they didn't know the result of their clash, they could see Luo Tian hadn't gained an advantage.
"What is he doing?" Yan Hongtao looked puzzled at Biao Dezu and others, but seeing their confidence, he grew more confused.
"Watch the show; Yan Haobo is about to suffer!" Sun Kainian and others whispered, recognizing what Luo Tian was about to unleash.
The "Bian Wang Battle Method," a technique of the Divine Clan's Epoch Lord-level masters, which bypasses epoch power and enhances combat strength through sheer body power.
"Die!" Yan Haobo's face was cold, seeing Luo Tian's exposed weaknesses and not missing the chance to attack.
"Crush..." But as Yan Haobo rose, Luo Tian unleashed a terrifying assault, his body launching forward faster than Biao Dezu's perception. A white light flashed.
"What..." Yan Hongtao froze, his eyes wide with disbelief. At this moment, Luo Tian appeared before him like an arrow shot from a bow.
"Who dies?" A cold voice echoed within the barrier as Luo Tian's fist smashed into Yan Haobo's body.
"Crack..." A crackling sound echoed from the barrier, Yan Haobo's body flying backward, his ribs caved in. His face was filled with disbelief as blood spewed from his mouth.
"Boom..." Yan Haobo's bloodied body collided with the crimson barrier, shaking it violently.
"How is this possible!" Yan Haobo couldn't believe Luo Tian's speed had increased so much, and his power was astonishingly strong—far greater than before.
"Terrifying technique!" Luo Tian marveled, this being his first use of the Bian Wang Battle Method. Though a bit unrefined, it had yielded an unexpected result.
"Again!" Luo Tian pushed off the ground, his body twisting rapidly. If not closely observed, no one could notice it.
"Boom..." As Yan Haobo fell from the barrier, Luo Tian rushed forward again, appearing before him. His white fist broke through the limits of power, smashing into Yan Haobo's face.
A crackling sound echoed; Yan Haobo was dazed, still reeling from the blow. He was struck again against the barrier, his hair disheveled and head cracked.
"Terrifying! Luo Tian's body was enhanced by two great techniques, and this Bian Wang Battle Method unleashed his terrifying physical strength. Even a master of the near-epoch level couldn't withstand it!" Biao Dezu and others whispered, their words reaching Yan Hongtao's ears, causing a storm in his heart.
"Terrifying!" Yan Hongtao muttered before softly uttering the two words.
"Boom... Boom... Boom..." The thunderous sound returned to the battlefield, but this time it was Luo Tian's one-sided碾压. His white fists continuously smashed Yan Haobo's body.
All of Slaughter City's people stared in shock at Yan Haobo being beaten by Luo Tian, the surrounding area silent. None expected that after their evenly matched clash, it had turned into this outcome—yet they'd mocked Luo Tian's strange posture.
The thunderous sound lasted nearly half a bell, and Yan Haobo's body lay like a pile of mud on the ground.
"Is that all you've got?" Luo Tian looked down at Yan Haobo, his voice cold as he stomped on his twisted face.
"Spit..." Blood splattered, Yan Haobo's bloodied head shattered under Luo Tian's foot, scattering across the battlefield.
"Die!" Luo Tian leaped into the air, then took a golden step forward—the first step of the "Vajra Seven Stomps."
"Boom..." The golden foot seemed to shatter the entire battlefield, rushing toward Yan Haobo who had no head.
"Buzz..." But as Luo Tian's foot descended, a wave of red light surged forth. Yan Haobo's body rapidly coalesced and transformed into a red beam, vanishing from the spot.
The golden foot struck the battlefield, and another thunderous sound echoed as wild waves spread outward.
Yan Haobo appeared in a corner of the battlefield, panting heavily, his body battered. His eyes glared at Luo Tian standing above him, a wild killing intent radiating from his body.
"Unexpectedly, you're so strong! The title of top genius truly fits!" Yan Haobo spoke softly, as if forgetting his earlier humiliation.
"Vajra God's Second Stomp Shatters the Stars!" Luo Tian ignored Yan Haobo's words, taking his second step forward to crush Yan Haobo.
"I'm not that easy to kill!" Yan Haobo waved his hands, crimson epoch power radiating from his body. His eyes turned blood-red, face twisted in ferocity, as if a demon from hell.
"Shura Chant..." Yan Haobo roared, crimson seals flying out and wrapping around Luo Tian's descending golden foot.
"Break!" Yan Haobo grabbed, the golden foot shattering under crimson seals. Waves of energy surged, engulfing both Luo Tian and Yan Haobo.
"Vajra God's Third Stomp Shatters the Gods... Vajra God's Fourth Stomp Drives Back the Divine..." Luo Tian spoke, taking his third and fourth steps forward, each step's power intensifying.
"Divine Axe Six Cuts!" Yan Haobo waved his hands, facing Luo Tian's advancing golden feet. His face showed no fear as a blood-red figure emerged behind him, wielding an axe that could cleave heaven and earth. The axe swung toward Luo Tian's golden feet.
"Boom... Boom... Boom..." Thunderous sounds echoed, the battlefield trembling under their clash. The crimson barrier seemed on the verge of collapse, causing Slaughter City's people to fear it might break, a disaster for them. Their battle's residual power could kill many of them.
But fortunately, the Slaughter Arena was created by the Epoch Lord of Slaughter Domain—extraordinarily sturdy. Though it seemed to crack several times, it ultimately endured.
"Vajra God's Seventh Stomp Shatters the Ancient..." Luo Tian spoke, his voice cold as his golden foot stepped forward from antiquity, shattering time and space. It rushed toward Yan Haobo with supreme power.
"Terrifying!" Yan Haobo's face showed fear, stunned by Luo Tian's strength. Yet his shadow swung the blood-red axe to meet Luo Tian's foot.
The thunderous sound surged, wild waves of power swirling within the barrier. Both had prepared their final blows, their power equally apocalyptic. Golden and crimson energy waves intertwined, engulfing the entire red barrier.
"Buzz..." The crimson barrier expanded under this terrifying power, cracks spreading across it.
"How is it? Has the battle ended?" The storm's sound made people deaf, unable to see or hear what was happening inside.
"I've never seen anyone withstand Luo Tian's full-force Vajra Stomps!" Biao Dezu and others looked astonished. They realized that the invincible Luo Tian might have met his match.
"Indeed, one mustn't underestimate anyone!" Zheng Xin and others finally showed concern.
Luo Tian had always been invincible, even defeating royal heirs and escaping after being attacked by ancient kings. Yet in human lands, he'd faced such an opponent.
After a storm of wind and chaos for an hour, two figures appeared in people's sight.
