“He is a formidable warrior from the Tianyang Realm. He arrived here with me via the Dao Platform. We've clashed for years!” Xu Liyi shouted as he fought and addressed Luo Tian.

“Come down!” Hearing Xu Liyi’s words, Luo Tian's eyes turned cold. He let out a snort and raised his hand to press into the void.

As Luo Tian’s hand descended, the rugged-faced middle-aged man opposing Xu Liyi froze in place. His face contorted with shock, and he plummeted like a meteor from the sky, crashing into the ground.

“How is this possible!” The middle-aged man spat blood, his eyes wide with disbelief. He had never imagined he could not withstand Luo Tian’s aura.

“Hah! Bastard, how do you like it? This is my brother!” Xu Liyi laughed loudly and descended from the sky, looking down at the middle-aged man subdued by Luo Tian’s aura.

“Alright, I admit it. Do what you will with me!” The middle-aged man’s face bore despair; he had no desire to resist.

“Enough…”

“I know. These years, you’ve held back,” Xu Liyi chuckled lightly. The two had fought for decades and developed a bond.

Luo Tian said nothing. He had long noticed that despite their fierce appearance, both Xu Liyi and the middle-aged man had held back in their attacks. Otherwise, the middle-aged man would not have merely been subdued but killed.

“Did you use your restraint?” The middle-aged man scoffed, his words defiant yet touched by the unspoken gratitude.

“Luo Tian, what now? I’ve had enough of this place!” Xu Liyi shifted his gaze to Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian?” The middle-aged man blinked, recognizing the name.

“Haha, bastard! You’ve definitely heard of him. The Lord of Reincarnation, right? He’s one of the Epoch Lords of the Nine Realms. Also, he is the father of the Void Lord and the Spirit Link Lord. Once we leave and return to the Nine Realms, he could obliterate your Eternal Yang Realm with a single breath!” Xu Liyi grinned at the middle-aged man’s suspicious gaze.

“Xiting and Lier have both become Epoch Lords?” Luo Tian smiled, marveling at his children’s success.

“More than that. Your daughter has already become the leader of the Nine Realms. You’ve even got grandchildren and great-grandchildren!” Xu Liyi’s eyes sparkled with amusement.

“A family of freaks!” The middle-aged man’s heart skipped a beat. He gazed at Luo Tian, admiration in his eyes. Now he understood why the leader of the Nine Realms was so formidable—having such a father made it impossible to be weak.

The collision between the Nine Realms and the Eternal Yang Realm had merged two star realms. Though they despised each other, they understood each other’s histories. The middle-aged man had certainly heard of Luo Tian before, but the time had passed so long he could barely recall.

“Let’s go. I know how to leave,” Luo Tian said nothing more, his mind already set. After resolving the current matter, he would seek out the Nine Realms.

Chapter 2669: Arrival()

On a black mountain peak, Luo Tian and three others stood on a Dao Platform spanning thousands of feet. Luo Tian channeled divine laws, etching them into the platform.

Ripples spread from the platform, gusts of wind howled. In the sky, a black vortex appeared.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian grabbed Xu Liyi and rushed into the black vortex. Shu Shengfei pulled Wang Batian behind Luo Tian.

The domain expanded, and in an instant, Luo Tian and Xu Liyi plunged into the vortex.

Space trembled; vast rifts of void swept over Luo Tian’s domain. Xu Liyi shuddered at the sight.

After an hour of flight, Luo Tian extended his hand. The void tore open, and he and Xu Liyi burst through.

Crash!

Upon emerging, Luo Tian heard the sound of waves. A vast pool of water stretched before him, endless and breathtaking.

“What is this?” Shu Shengfei followed closely, his eyes wide with shock. The yellow spring water radiated purification power that even he found astonishing.

Above the golden pool, a yellow ancient coffin hovered. Waves of energy radiated from it, merging into the spring water. To Luo Tian, it seemed more like the energy had transformed into the golden water.

“What is this?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed. The yellow water was none other than the Yellow River.

The aura on the coffin was equally terrifying, matching even that of the previous Evil Emperor Song Woji. It was an imperial aura.

“Yellow River Tomb!” Luo Tian recognized the inscription on the coffin, his eyes wide with horror.

“Another has arrived!” As Luo Tian appeared, shouts echoed from the edge of the golden pool.

His gaze shifted to the pool’s rim, where several figures stood. Yin Wu was among them. To Luo Tian’s surprise, Diao Dezhu, Xiang Tianming, Chen Zhanbiao, and Ren Hongzhe were also there.

Moreover, he spotted the Holy Prince of Fengdu Palace, Ye Qiu, and the Holy Prince of Shiluo Palace, Wang Xiu, along with three other palace holy princes. Behind them stood two palace’s strongholds. Luo Tian did not spot Yang Huanyu or the Luoshengmen.

“Luo Tian, come out quickly!” As Luo Tian hesitated, the people around him recognized him and shouted urgently.

“Huh?” Luo Tian detected urgency in Diao Dezhu’s voice. His eyes held confusion, but he still leapt up and pulled Xu Liyi toward the pool’s edge.

Crash!

As Luo Tian moved, the golden water surged. In an instant, countless figures of yellow water coalesced, blocking Luo Tian’s path—countless in number.

“What is this?” Luo Tian’s heart trembled. Each of these yellow figures radiated immense power, the weakest being True Immortal level, while the strongest reached Late Immortal King. Even two of them bore the aura of Peak Immortal King.

“This is the Yellow River Army,” Yin Wu shouted. “The subordinates of the Yellow River Lord. This entire pool is filled with the Yellow River Army, endless and unending!”

“Troublesome,” Luo Tian muttered. Instantly, countless Yellow River Army surged toward him and Shu Shengfei, blocking their view. All they could see was the golden water cascading endlessly.

“We’ll assist!” Xiang Tianming shouted and leapt forward, rushing toward Luo Tian’s direction.

Chen Zhanbiao, Diao Dezhu, and Ren Hongzhe followed Xiang Tianming into the golden pool.

Luo Tian had left, and the four had secretly followed him. With Diao Dezhu’s nose, they found Luo Tian quickly—though they arrived at the ancestral god mountain too late.

After navigating countless dangers, they finally reached this place. The other palace holy princes and strongholds had arrived two days later. When the four came, only Yin Wu was there.

They also knew the Yellow River Army was no easy foe. A million of them, strong and with an endless formation that could exhaust anyone to death.

The later holy princes had also been blocked by the Yellow River Army. Otherwise, they would have already fought over the central yellow coffin.

“Killing them all is impossible!” Shu Shengfei roared, his blood sword slicing through. Each strike shattered countless Yellow River Army soldiers, yet they kept coming endlessly.

Luo Tian did the same. Their movement was slow due to numerous King-level Yellow River Army soldiers, and they dared not be careless. On either side of the yellow coffin stood two figures radiating immense power.

“Immortal Kings are everywhere!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly. Even in ancient times, Immortal Kings must have been so common.

Meanwhile, Xiang Tianming and the others kept striking, dispersing the Yellow River Army attacking Luo Tian and Shu Shengfei. Two groups slowly advanced toward each other.

As for Ye Qiu and others, they watched coldly. Their main goal was the coffin—its value was immeasurable.

“Hope Luo Tian and his group can draw those two Peak Immortal Kings away. Then we’ll have a chance!”

“Unless it’s an actual Peak Immortal King, no one can match those two,” Tian Baiguang sighed.

Chapter 2670: The Yellow River Coffin()

Above the golden water, waves surged endlessly, forming countless Yellow River Army soldiers attacking Luo Tian and Xiang Tianming’s group.

“Can’t kill them all!” Shu Shengfei shouted at Luo Tian. Their domain had already shattered, and they had killed countless Yellow River Army soldiers—dozens of Immortal King-level ones. Yet, more kept forming.

Despite this, Luo Tian and Xiang Tianming’s group pressed forward slowly. Two Peak Immortal Kings kept their eyes on Luo Tian’s group.

“Don’t come closer, don’t come closer…” They hoped the two Peak Immortal Kings wouldn’t approach. If they did, they might be wiped out.

Their opponents were perhaps not as strong as true Peak Immortal Kings but still far superior to them.

“Luo Tian, have you noticed that although these Yellow River Army soldiers seem endless, they’ve become fewer as we kill them? Their formation speed has also slowed!”

“Yes. That means they have their limits,” Luo Tian nodded, shattering an Immortal King-level Yellow River Army soldier. His main concern was the two Peak Immortal Kings and Yang Huanyu, who had vanished. He knew Luoshengmen was strong with deep roots but would never abandon the Yellow River Coffin. After all, it buried the Yellow River Lord. Even the Ten Palaces would envy its treasures. Otherwise, why had the Ten Palace strongholds rushed here?

“Why haven’t those two Peak Immortal Kings moved yet?” The people outside the golden pool looked anxious. They hoped Luo Tian’s group would draw the Peak Immortal Kings away, giving them a chance to approach the coffin and retrieve it.

They had tried entering for days and discovered some patterns. Though these Yellow River Army soldiers were strong, they could not leave the golden pool.

“Where is the Yellow River Lord?” Luo Tian also searched for another figure—the one who had drawn him here. The Yellow River, the first spirit he subdued with his Ghost Sealing Art. The King of Spirits.

Later, the King of Spirits had gained memories and told Luo Tian his name was the Yellow River. However, due to the long time passed, Luo Tian had even forgotten him.

He remembered now because the tomb’s owner also bore the name Yellow River. He suspected a connection, otherwise why would the King of Spirits call himself Yellow River? After all, it was an ancient immortal’s name.

Yet Luo Tian was curious why the King of Spirits hadn’t revealed himself directly but remained hidden. The battle continued. One thousand feet away, they fought for an hour before covering five thousand more feet. Their bodies bore injuries; only Luo Tian and Xiang Tianming remained unscathed, and due to the Yellow River’s influence, Xiang Tianming’s combat power was significantly higher.

After an hour, the Yellow River Army’s strength weakened. Their speed increased gradually.

“Roar!” As they fought, the two Peak Immortal Kings guarding the coffin let out roars.

With their cries, the Yellow River Army attacking Luo Tian’s group ceased. They reverted to golden water and returned to the pool.

Luo Tian’s group naturally regrouped, rushing toward the pool’s edge.

“Damn!” The other palace strongholds gritted their teeth. They watched Luo Tian’s group return to the pool’s edge.

Their expressions changed; the holy princes smiled, gazing at Luo Tian: “Congratulations on your ascension again!”

“Greetings,” Luo Tian knew they wished him dead but maintained politeness.

“Smiling on the face, yet…” Ren Hongzhe scoffed, looking down at the Ten Palaces’ strongholds.

“Let me show you someone. You’ll be thrilled!” Luo Tian smiled and addressed Diao Dezhu’s group.

As he spoke, Luo Tian waved his hand. Xu Liyi appeared before them, bewildered. After a moment of confusion, he saw Diao Dezhu’s group and widened his eyes.

“Damn! Old Xu, how did you end up here? Am I dreaming?” Diao Dezhu exclaimed and rushed toward Xu Liyi.

“Haha, dog!” Xu Liyi laughed and embraced Diao Dezhu.

During the Nine Realms era, Xu Liyi, Zheng Xin, and Diao Dezhu often quarreled but were the best of friends—more accurately, they shared a mutual dislike.

“Haha, Xu Liyi, how did you end up here?” Ren Hongzhe smiled.

“Big brother!” Chen Zhanbiao’s eyes turned red with emotion, rushing toward Xu Liyi and hugging him.

“Damn it, Zhanbiao, be gentle…” Xu Liyi’s neck turned red from the hug but was overjoyed.

Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao had been together since the Southern Region of Tianyuan. This was their longest separation, previously only a few months. Chen Zhanbiao missed Xu Liyi dearly.

“Great! Seeing you is great, my god. You don’t know how I didn’t suffocate—unless it was for that bastard, I would’ve gone mad!” Xu Liyi broke free.

“Haha, little Xu, you’re still weak. How come you’re so weak?” Diao Dezhu observed Xu Liyi, his eyes brightening. He instinctively crossed his arms.

“Don’t worry; from now on, follow me, and you’ll eat well and drink well. After all, I was the former head of Tianyuan Sect!” Diao Dezhu added, making Xu Liyi smile.

“Shut up. You just arrived in the Immortal Realm millions of years before me. What’s there to be proud of?” Xu Liyi cursed.

“Seems I need to subdue you!” Diao Dezhu waved his hand, instantly pinning Xu Liyi to the ground.

“Damn it, dog! You bastard, Zhanbiao, beat him!” Xu Liyi shouted at Chen Zhanbiao.

“Got it!” Chen Zhanbiao roared, glaring fiercely at Diao Dezhu. Diao Dezhu shrank back and withdrew his hand.

“Liyi, we’re all brothers. Just messing around, just messing around. I… Zhanbiao, don’t be impulsive…” In an instant, the pool’s edge became chaotic. Chen Zhanbiao chased Diao Dezhu.

Luo Tian felt a headache, thinking these guys always acted so carefree no matter the situation.

Yet Luo Tian’s heart warmed. He had made up his mind: after stabilizing Tianyuan Sect completely, he would find the Nine Realms and reunite everyone.

“Luo Tian!” As they were all laughing, a shout echoed. Luo Tian turned his gaze toward the sound.

Chapter 2671: Establishing Authority()

“Something wrong?” Luo Tian frowned, gazing at the old man who spoke. He was an Immortal King Late Stage from the苦神殿 (Kushen Sect).

Luo Tian seemed to have met him before but had no memory. However, the old man’s tone made it clear he was not here for friendly reasons.

“Tianyuan Sect is currently surviving in Hell. I recall you made a pact with the Ten Palace Lords to submit to Yama’s Ten Palaces and exterminate Luoshengmen. Now, the Luoshengmen strongholds are in that coffin!”

“We need you to draw those Yellow River Army soldiers away so the Ten Palaces can retrieve the coffin and exterminate Luoshengmen!” The old man spoke, his eyes filled with arrogance, as if looking down on subordinates.

“Exactly. This time, it’s about Tianyuan Sect’s sincerity. If you don’t help, we’ll consider your lack of sincerity and report to the Palace Lords after leaving. You should know what consequences Tianyuan Sect will face,” other palace strongholds also spoke, their eyes gleaming.

“Disgusting!” Luo Tian’s gaze fell on the palace strongholds, his disgust evident at their faces.

This was clearly making them cannon fodder. They threatened him with Tianyuan Sect, but he had seen many unscrupulous people—this was one of the worst.

Luo Tian glanced at the palace holy princes, Ye Qiu and Wang Xiu. Their faces flushed slightly but they said nothing. After all, they weren’t yet Palace Lords.

“If I refuse?” Luo Tian smirked. With over half a year passed, only months remained before the two years were up. If Luoshengmen wasn’t exterminated, the Ten Palaces would still trouble him. So he didn’t mind tearing things apart now.

“Refuse? Then sorry, after leaving, Tianyuan Sect will be destroyed!” The old man who spoke first said.

“Damn it, what are you? Let us die for you? Are we your fathers?” Xu Liyi cursed loudly and didn’t stop, leaving everyone stunned.

“Who is this? A mere True Immortal level, yet he dares to insult an Immortal King…” Everyone stared at Xu Liyi as if looking at a fool.

“You…!” The old man’s face turned red, his eyes filled with killing intent, gazing at Xu Liyi.

“You what? My dear grandson, I am your long-lost grandfather…” Xu Liyi’s curses never ceased.

“This curse… my god, it feels so good. Curse like this with Zheng Xin and…” Diao Dezhu admired Xu Liyi’s curses.

“Die!” The old man could no longer endure. Who could withstand such a curse from Xu Liyi, especially since he was merely a True Immortal.

He raised his hand and slammed it toward Xu Liyi, a massive hand of power descending. If it hit Xu Liyi, he would be obliterated.

“Zhanbiao, take him down!” Seeing the old man attack, Xu Liyi retreated and shouted at Chen Zhanbiao.

“Got it!” Chen Zhanbiao roared, without hesitation, rushing forward and standing beside Xu Liyi. He punched the old man’s hand.

Boom!

Chen Zhanbiao’s fist collided with the old man’s hand. Wind surged, and Chen Zhanbiao took several steps back before stopping.

“Old man, you’re pretty tough! Big brother, I can’t beat him!” Chen Zhanbiao turned and grumbled at Luo Tian.

“Die!” Luo Tian saw Chen Zhanbiao pushed back. His eyes gradually turned cold, and he stepped on the ground, vanishing from his spot.

Luo Tian appeared like a ghost before the old man and punched him.

The old man’s face contorted. Luo Tian was now an Immortal King Late Stage, though newly ascended. However, his foundation was deep and did not show the signs of a new Immortal King.

“Get out…” The old man growled and punched Luo Tian’s fist.

Thunder echoed in space. Their fists collided, the old man’s face turned red with shock and his body retreated.

The old man took ten steps back before stopping. He couldn’t help but spit blood from his mouth.

“Who do you think you are to touch?” Luo Tian roared, flying up and appearing before the old man again. He swung his fist toward the old man.

“Damn it!” The old man’s face changed, but there was no time to do anything. He could only keep defending Luo Tian’s attacks.

Countless fists filled the space before Luo Tian and the old man. The old man kept retreating, with a continuous sound of thuds.

Boom!

Finally, the old man had no place to retreat and collided with the wall behind him. Dust flew as Luo Tian smashed him into the wall.

Blood flowed from the old man’s body, his injuries severe. His eyes were unfocused.

Luo Tian coldly gazed at the Ten Palaces’ strongholds: “Who else?”

“Too powerful… he’s risen. No one can suppress him except Palace Lords!” Everyone trembled, scared by Luo Tian’s gaze and dared not speak. Killing a chicken to scare the monkeys—Luo Tian’s action was clear, but no one dared say anything. They each had only one Immortal King Late Stage and a holy prince. If they united, maybe they could destroy Luo Tian’s group. But who would dare? They knew the cost of destroying Luo Tian’s group would be too heavy.

“Luo Tian! Are you rebelling?” The holy prince of Kushen Sect shouted, his voice filled with anger.

“Rebellion? You don’t force me, how would I rebel? Tianyuan Sect still belongs to the Ten Palaces. But don’t force us; if you do, we’ll destroy Tianyuan Sect and take a piece of your flesh!” Luo Tian replied strongly. He decided, after leaving, his first task would be to visit the Ghost-Devouring Marsh and bring out the Snake Emperor. He wanted to see who dared touch Tianyuan Sect.

Everyone fell silent, unsure how to respond. They had thought Luo Tian would compromise with the Ten Palaces but instead found him so strong.

“What is his capital?” Ye Qiu and Wang Xiu’s eyes held suspicion. They knew Luo Tian wasn’t reckless; he wouldn’t say this without a solid foundation.

“Is it his Immortal King Late Stage? Impossible…” Ye Qiu and Wang Xiu were puzzled. Just by Luo Tian’s Immortal King Late Stage, he wouldn’t be able to withstand the Ten Palaces’ attack.

The scene calmed down. Luo Tian returned to Diao Dezhu’s group, gazing at everyone.

“Don’t treat us as nothing. If you force me, I’ll leave all of you here!” Luo Tian smirked, arms crossed, watching them without intending to re-enter the Yellow River Pool.

Chapter 2672: Buried in the Coffin()

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, everyone fell silent. Though they thought he was boasting, since they had six Immortal King Late Stages among them and only two of his group, even if Luo Tian was strong, he wouldn’t be their match.

“Who wants to go in? Go ahead. Don’t drag us along. We’ve already weakened some of the Yellow River Army soldiers. You can try now!” Luo Tian’s gaze was playful, looking at them.

The Ten Palaces’ strongholds said nothing. No one wanted to enter the Yellow River Pool, not wanting others to take advantage.

Luo Tian’s group had managed to escape because they hadn’t rushed toward the Yellow River coffin and the two Peak Immortal Kings hadn’t acted. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been so easy.

The scene remained tense. Luo Tian’s group stood chatting, appearing not to care about the Yellow River coffin at all.

Time passed slowly. An hour had gone by, yet no one was willing to take the lead.

Buzz…

As Luo Tian’s group remained tense, waves suddenly emanated from the Yellow River coffin. The massive lid trembled, and a collision sound echoed inside it, drawing everyone’s attention to the coffin.

“Something is wrong. Could the Yellow River Lord be reviving?” Someone gasped, gazing at the ancient coffin with disbelief.

“This is no fun!” People stared intently at the coffin, not thinking the speaker was joking. After all, it buried an Emperor, a powerful being who once ruled the world.

Luo Tian’s eyes glowed golden. He gazed at the Yellow River coffin. Ye Qiu’s eyes turned white as he activated his Ghost-Seeing Eyes, both of them widening their eyes.

“Someone is inside the coffin!” Luo Tian and Ye Qiu spoke simultaneously, causing people to gasp.

“And not just one. There are several of them, fighting over something!” Ye Qiu added.

“How is this possible? Who dares enter the Yellow River coffin?” Diao Dezhu was stunned.

“It’s the Yellow River…” Luo Tian sighed softly, gazing at the ancient coffin. He could see some faint figures inside it. At the moment the lid opened, he felt a familiar aura—Yelllow River.

“What should we do? Who is inside?” Everyone was confused and anxious. If there were people, they might not even get a drop.

Luo Tian was also anxious but kept his expression calm. He carefully observed the massive coffin, yet could see nothing.

“Let’s all go in. One of us will take responsibility for attracting the Yellow River Army,” Ye Qiu suggested, seeing more clearly than Luo Tian.

“Good!” In an instant, they reached an agreement. Their eyes fell on Luo Tian’s group.

“Good!” Luo Tian nodded, this was exactly what he wanted. In an instant, they all moved.

“Zhanbiao, Hongzhe, stay behind to protect your elder and Wang Batian!” Luo Tian addressed Chen Zhanbiao and Ren Hongzhe, then flew up with Xiang Tianming and Diao Dezhu.

“Respectful elder, you guard the Yellow River Army. If you can’t hold them back, retreat!” Luo Tian addressed Xiang Tianming and flew up into the Yellow River Pool’s sky. His spear, Lietian, appeared in his hand.

Crash!

The Yellow River surged, the towering yellow water instantly forming Yellow River Army soldiers rushing toward Luo Tian’s group. The two Peak Immortal Kings guarding the coffin turned their gaze to Luo Tian’s group.

Light flashed. Ye Qiu wielded his sword, Jueyun, and slashed it. The yellow water was split by the blade’s light, hundreds of Yellow River Army soldiers were instantly destroyed.

Boom boom boom…

They all attacked. The massive Yellow River Pool trembled violently, and the yellow water shattered and fell.

Luo Tian’s group were now top-tier warriors of the Immortal Realm. Though the Yellow River Army was strong, they couldn’t match these people. They pushed forward swiftly and had already advanced three thousand feet.

The two Peak Immortal Kings gazed at Luo Tian’s group, letting out low growls. The yellow water seemed furious, forming a massive wave that surged toward Luo Tian’s group. Within the waves were several powerful King-level Yellow River Army soldiers, roaring at Luo Tian’s group.

Eight Immortal King Late Stages!

Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed. He didn’t bother with the eight Immortal King Late Stages but entrusted them to Xiang Tianming and the other six Immortal King Late Stages from the Ten Palaces. Xiang Tianming’s group was meant to draw out those two Peak Immortal Kings.

Though eight Immortal King Late Stages blocked them, they couldn’t stop Luo Tian’s group. The two Peak Immortal Kings finally could not hold back.

The yellow water coalesced in front of the two Peak Immortal Kings, divine laws flowing. It formed into two divine swords and rushed toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Leave the rest to you!” Xiang Tianming shouted at Luo Tian, his body expanding. He sucked in ten thousand Yellow River Army soldiers, twisting them into yellow water and swallowing it.

The water surged. The Peng bird spread its wings. Xiang Tianming opened his mouth and spat out a massive column of yellow water toward one Peak Immortal King.

Other palace’s Immortal King Late Stages also attacked, eight strikes sweeping the sky toward the two Peak Immortal Kings.

As Xiang Tianming and others attacked the two Peak Immortal Kings, the remaining Yellow River Army soldiers were left for Luo Tian’s group.

“Go!” Luo Tian wielded his Lietian spear and thrust it forward. A crackling sound echoed from the spear, instantly destroying an Immortal King Late Stage Yellow River Army soldier.

The yellow water surged beneath Luo Tian, forming a wave. He seemed to walk on the water, pushing his speed to its limit. Diao Dezhu followed him, and they rushed toward the Yellow River coffin, shattering countless Yellow River Army soldiers in their path.

Boom boom boom…

The chaotic energy erupted. The two Peak Immortal Kings faced eight Immortal King Late Stages without fear, their swords striking and instantly destroying Xiang Tianming’s group.

Within tens of seconds, Luo Tian and Diao Dezhu reached the massive ancient coffin. Other palace strongholds followed closely, landing before the coffin.

Tian Baiguang placed his hand on the coffin’s lid and shouted, trying to open it. However, it remained unmoved.

“Hmm…” Tian Baiguang’s forehead was drenched in sweat but the lid still didn’t budge.

“Damn it!” After tens of seconds, Tian Baiguang cursed and gave up. He looked at Luo Tian’s group.

“Let’s try together!” Luo Tian knew the coffin was no ordinary thing. He didn’t act recklessly and placed his hand on the coffin, feeling a cold sensation and immense pressure instantly冲击 him. He gave a slight tremor.

Chapter 2673: Opening the Coffin()

The moment Luo Tian touched the coffin, he understood why Tian Baiguang couldn’t open it. The Emperor’s aura suppressed him.

“Open!” Everyone shouted, exerting their strength. They knew they needed to unite to lift it, so they were默契.

Buzz…

The four big characters on the coffin glowed. Waves of Emperor’s aura fell upon Luo Tian and others.

Boom boom boom boom…

In an instant, Luo Tian felt another hand pushing them. They were all pushed back.

“Not bad for an Emperor! Even after death, it’s so hard to deal with!” Luo Tian exhaled, his eyes filled with admiration.

“Who put the person inside?” Wang Xiu’s face was full of disbelief. Such a coffin, even an Immortal King Peak could not open it. Clearly, the person inside was either extremely powerful or had cunning methods.

“What should we do?” Everyone’s faces bore bitterness. They found the Yellow River coffin but couldn’t even open it, let alone move it.

“There must be a way!”

“I don’t believe the person inside is also an Emperor!” Luo Tian muttered, gazing at the Yellow River coffin.

Boom boom boom…

As Luo Tian and others pondered how to open the coffin, it emitted more booming sounds.

“Haha, Luo Tian, you need help!” As they were at a loss, a playful voice echoed. Three figures appeared in their view.

“Damn it, why did you come so late? I was wondering how such a big tomb could miss you!” Seeing the three, Diao Dezhu shouted.

A fat man and two thin men stood before them. They wore silk robes, their bodies adorned with treasures—three walking treasure vaults.

Sun Kelnian, Sima Tuo, and the thief who had shattered the Yellow River Army soldiers arrived before them.

Seeing them, Luo Tian smiled. Their timing was perfect. For their expertise, he had great confidence.

“Didn’t we just wander around?” Sun Kelnian puffed out his belly and approached Luo Tian’s group.

“Come on, did you get a lot of benefits? Give the brothers some!” Diao Dezhu approached Sun Kelnian, looking at their glowing treasures.

“Go to hell…”

“I just barely saved my stash. It’s not easy!” Sun Kelnian cursed, recalling past incidents where these guys would ambush him and steal his things.

“Who are these people? Where did they come from?” Seeing Sun Kelnian’s unimpressive appearance, the other palace people looked puzzled but dared not underestimate them since they were with Luo Tian.

“Get to work!” Luo Tian kicked Sun Kelnian’s butt and sent him toward the Yellow River coffin.

“Damn it, do you have any manners?” Sun Kelnian cursed, rubbing his butt. He stopped before the Yellow River coffin, eyes gleaming as he observed it. Sima Tuo and Zhang Chenglong also approached the coffin, circling it while observing.

They walked for a incense time without speaking, their eyes filled with excitement.

“Are you guys reliable? If not, don’t waste our time!” The太平 Palace (Taiping Palace) strongholds looked impatient, thinking these three were unreliable.
