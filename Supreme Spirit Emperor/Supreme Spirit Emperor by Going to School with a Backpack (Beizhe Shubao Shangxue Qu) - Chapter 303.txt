“What? Don’t you want to play with me first?” Yang Jinghua stepped forward, his eyes flickering with amusement as he lightly caressed the blood-red long sword on his back.

“I’m not interested. You’re not my match!” Hu Tianzong shook his head, though he knew Yang Jinghua was no easy opponent. If they fought, he would surely suffer a painful defeat. The fact that Yang Jinghua could instill fear in the barbarian clans proved he had hidden strengths.

“Haha, Yang Brother, he’s mine!” A deep laugh echoed as Luo Tian surged forth, his aura violently surging. His golden eyes gleamed as he locked onto Hu Tianzong.

“Finally arrived? I thought you’d chicken out,” Hu Tianzong sneered, instantly leaping onto the ancient Seven Star Platform.

“Chicken out?” Luo Tian shook his head lightly, also leaping into the air. He stood on the platform with disdainful eyes, offering no explanation.

“Wum…”, a series of tremors rippled through the massive Seven Star Platform. Seven radiant lights ascended, seemingly connecting with heaven and earth before forming a transparent barrier that encircled the platform.

“Kill!” As the barrier solidified, Hu Tianzong’s eyes sharpened. His spear whirled as he lunged at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with fearless resolve. He transformed into a golden dragon, charging toward Hu Tianzong.

In an instant, the two clashed. However, Luo Tian refrained from using his Wuyao Sword, instead relying on his body to withstand Hu Tianzong’s spear.

“Die!” Below the platform, Hu Jian’an and Hu Jianhua sneered. Though they knew Luo Tian’s body was formidable, Hu Tianzong’s attack could not be compared to a half-step Epoch-level opponent.

“Zhi…”, a piercing sound echoed. A moment later, golden fists collided with the spear tip, producing metallic friction.

“Fearsome body!” Hu Tianzong’s Huanlong Spear hummed, its shaft slightly bending. He retreated instantly, his eyes filled with intense caution.

“You underestimate me!” Luo Tian’s battle spirit flared. He charged like a feral beast toward Hu Tianzong.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s steps activated the Yin Ghost Step, his confidence bolstered by his enhanced body. He now possessed the strength to challenge a half-step Epoch.

The thunderous sound rose beneath Luo Tian’s feet. In the blink of an eye, he appeared behind Hu Tianzong, launching a powerful punch toward his back.

“Hmph!” Hu Tianzong sneered, neither dodging nor retreating. He turned to face Luo Tian, his eyes filled with contempt.

Luo Tian’s heart tightened, a bad premonition rising. Yet his punch had already been thrown; if it struck, even a half-step Epoch would suffer.

But in that moment, Luo Tian’s punch met Hu Tianzong’s back—only to penetrate empty air. The crowd erupted in shock.

“What’s going on!” Their eyes widened, stunned by Hu Tianzong’s sudden disadvantage. Yet they soon noticed something amiss.

“Shadow!” Luo Tian’s mind raced. He hadn’t expected Hu Tianzong to be this fast—despite having activated the Yin Ghost Step, his speed had reached near half-step Epoch limits. Yet Hu Tianzong was faster.

Hu Tianzong’s form gradually faded within Luo Tian’s punch. The fist plunged into empty space, the sound of thunder echoing from the void.

“Powerful! Luo Tian’s body—what is it made of? Even his physical strength alone can sweep through half-step Epochs! If he lands a solid hit, I wouldn’t survive!” Observers from the other islands, their bodies at half-step Epoch level, grimaced in awe.

“Hu Tianzong’s speed has reached its peak. In terms of strength, they’ve surpassed us!” The seventh island leader’s face twisted with bitterness as he gazed at the Seven Star Platform.

“Too slow!” A cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. Then he heard a piercing hum—his back was pierced by an invisible force.

“Move!” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate. His body vanished from the spot, but he was too late. A spear tip pierced his back, leaving only a red dot on his skin before retreating.

“Divine King’s Nine Heavens Map!” Luo Tian raised his hand, unleashing the divine map toward his back. The massive image radiated world-destroying power, crushing the figure he sensed was Hu Tianzong.

“Boom…”, the map failed to touch Hu Tianzong’s body. It instead struck a shadow, exploding against the Seven Star Platform with a deafening roar.

Rocks scattered across the platform, colliding with the surrounding barrier like raindrops.

“His speed is too fast!” The crowd’s faces showed awe. Luo Tian’s speed had already left them dazzled, yet they hadn’t expected Hu Tianzong to be even faster.

“I see! It’s the Body Transference Technique!” One island leader spoke, his eyes wide with disbelief. He gazed at Shen Gongfu.

The Body Transference Technique was the only one mastered by Shen Gongfu of the third island. Yet Hu Tianzong had also acquired this great technique.

If Luo Tian’s Brahman Attack was the pinnacle of offense, then this Body Transference Technique was the pinnacle of speed.

“Indeed, a prodigy!” The crowd murmured in admiration. Even the island leaders showed awe.

“Pinnacle of speed?” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly before a smile spread across his face. His body seemed forged in gold, with waves of sound echoing from within. If anyone could see his body, they would be stunned—his blood seemed to boil violently.

“Warm-up’s over! Now it’s time for the real thing!” Hu Tianzong’s cold voice echoed from all directions, making it impossible to locate his position.

“Indeed. The warm-up is done! Now I’ll end you!” Luo Tian responded confidently, showing no fear despite his opponent’s speed.

“Warm-up!” The crowd gasped. Their battle had been just a warm-up—meaning the real fight hadn’t even begun.

“Eternal Restraint!” A series of gray dragons surged forth from all directions, instantly reaching Luo Tian. They roared and constricted his body before vanishing into it.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He felt himself immobilized, a force binding him—his soul itself was restrained.

Seeing Luo Tian frozen in place, Hu Tianzong’s eyes flickered with a smile. He finally appeared before the crowd.

“Now you’re a lamb awaiting slaughter. What strength do you have left to fight me?” Hu Tianzong raised his Huanlong Spear above his head while emitting gray mist from his body, infusing it into the spear.

Chapter 1254: The Mandate of the Epoch Lord ()

The cold spear, radiating apocalyptic power, hovered above Hu Tianzong’s head. Luo Tian felt a growing sense of crisis—the strange force not only restrained his body but also made it weak, as if something had drained his strength.

“Wum…” Hu Tianzong pointed at Luo Tian. The spear transformed into a gray dragon, roaring toward him.

“Get out!” Luo Tian roared, his body engulfed in black mist. He entered a demonic state, veins bulging as his blood boiled. He unleashed all his strength to break free from the strange force.

“Don’t struggle. No one but me can release this Eternal Restraint!” Hu Tianzong’s face bore a triumphant smile as he spoke to Luo Tian.

“Boom…” But in an instant, Hu Tianzong’s expression changed. His eyes widened with disbelief.

“Nothing is absolute in this world!” Luo Tian’s face twisted with madness. Gray mist emerged from his body, eventually dissipating into swirling gray clouds around him.

“This is my strongest state!” Luo Tian sneered, grabbing the gray spear that had reached his heart. He instantly pinned it before him.

“Roar…” The gray dragon disintegrated, transforming into a gray spear that appeared in Luo Tian’s hand.

“Good sword. Here it is!” Luo Tian smiled, tossing the Huanlong Spear back toward Hu Tianzong.

“Plop…” Blood splattered. Hu Tianzong was still stunned by how Luo Tian had escaped his technique. In a blink, the spear reached him. Fortunately, the spear protected its master; Hu Tianzong’s speed was remarkable, or that spear would have pierced his heart and left him severely wounded.

“Great Dao’s Demon-Subduing!” Luo Tian appeared beside Hu Tianzong like a demon god. Thunderous sounds erupted, cracks in the void forming around his fists as they smashed toward Hu Tianzong.

Luo Tian’s current state was formidable. Even against a half-step Epoch, he dared to fight. With numerous great techniques at his disposal, he was confident in his invincibility.

A fist pierced the void again, striking Hu Tianzong’s shadow. The sky cracked like a shattered mirror, appearing before the crowd.

“This attack!” The first and second island leaders’ faces changed completely. They felt a powerful crisis under Luo Tian’s punch, even if they faced it themselves, they would be severely injured.

“Rebellious! No one within the half-step Epoch can withstand this attack. If touched, it would be a severe injury!” Tong Yangjian’s eyes held awe.

Hu Tianzong appeared ten thousand zhang away, his face filled with intense caution. His shoulder’s wound slowly healed.

“Only running?” Luo Tian sneered, standing like a demon god, his aura terrifying.

“What if I do? I’ve mastered the pinnacle of speed. I’ll never lose!” Hu Tianzong’s face was grim.

He had expected to subdue Luo Tian with his strength, but instead, in a blink, Luo Tian had broken two of his techniques and forced him into this position. If it were a regular half-step Epoch, they would have already been annihilated.

“Think speed alone makes you unbeatable?” Luo Tian’s face was cold. He gazed at Hu Tianzong, then闪动 toward him. At the same time, Wuyao Sword was drawn.

“Wuyao Sword—endless sword!” Golden light shot from Luo Tian’s hand, instantly filling the barrier. It slashed within the massive barrier.

“Body Transference!” Hu Tianzong闪动, instantly vanishing from sight. Even with Luo Tian’s Purple Extreme Demon Eyes open, he could only sense a gray line穿梭 through the sword light.

“Come out!” Luo Tian wasn’t surprised. Knowing Hu Tianzong was the second strongest of the Seven Star Island, he must have his own methods. He formed a hand seal, his spiritual awareness spreading like waves from his body, instantly filling the barrier.

The massive spiritual awareness grew and twisted light, giving the barrier a hazy appearance. Meanwhile, Hu Tianzong’s face turned grim as he felt the sea-like spiritual force blocking his rapid movement.

“Slowing down?” Luo Tian’s face was pale, but the spiritual awareness seemed boundless, spreading outward again.

“There!” As the spiritual awareness squeezed, Luo Tian finally caught Hu Tianzong’s form. He闪动 like lightning toward him.

“Damn it! Fate Punch!” Hu Tianzong’s face was grim. As he moved, he punched Luo Tian with a powerful wave.

“Not bad!” Luo Tian coldly spoke. Facing Hu Tianzong’s full-force punch, he showed disdain. His golden fist collided with Hu Tianzong’s.

“Boom…” A sound of broken bones echoed. Hu Tianzong’s body was instantly sent flying, crashing into the barrier and causing it to thunderously rumble.

The crowd gasped. Their eyes widened as they saw Hu Tianzong embedded in the barrier, stunned by his defeat.

“How is this possible!” Hu Jian’an and Hu Jianhua’s faces were pale, their eyes filled with disbelief. Hu Tianzong was their pride; even against Guan Xingjian, he hadn’t been so helpless.

“Xingjian wouldn’t be Luo Tian’s match either. In the half-step Epoch, Luo Tian is invincible. Even if he faces a full Epoch, he’d be careless and lose!” Tong Yangjian’s face was filled with admiration as he voiced his thoughts.

The other six island leaders nodded silently, then their faces showed joy. Luo Tian’s strength exceeded their expectations; he might truly attain the Dao.

“His body is unmatched, his bloodline extraordinary. His spiritual awareness is incredibly strong. Luo Tian has reached perfection. Perhaps he can now enter the Epoch!” Second island leader Feng Yong’s face showed admiration.

“I recall a legend. There is a body type with unmatched physical strength and bloodline!” Tong Yangjian spoke, his eyes filled with confusion.

“Reincarnation Body!” Feng Yong couldn’t help but speak, his voice uncertain. Yet he looked at the mighty Luo Tian before him, never having seen such a rebellious genius.

“It can’t be! That’s a legendary body type. How could it appear!” Other island leaders’ faces were shocked, disbelieving.

“The Reincarnation Body has rebellious fortune. Nine lifetimes of reincarnation, each life not lasting long—like accumulating fortune for the ninth lifetime to burst forth! Attaining the Dao!” Tong Yangjian’s voice was light, but it stirred a great wave in their hearts. They looked at Luo Tian as if seeing the young Epoch Lord, invincible among peers.

“There’s nothing impossible. Xingjian isn’t also a legendary body type, the Star-Weaving Body!” Tong Yangjian shook his head lightly.

“Think this is over?” Hu Tianzong’s body emerged from the barrier, his eyes filled with a sinister expression as if making a decision. He spoke to Luo Tian.

“I knew you had another trick. Come on, let’s see what you’ve got!” Luo Tian was enveloped in demonic energy, his face obscured.

“Even if I’m not your match at half-step Epoch, what about the full Epoch?” Hu Tianzong shouted, his voice filled with hatred. He gazed at Luo Tian, his hands rapidly changing, emitting gray mist.

“Wum…” A moment later, a violent pressure descended from the gray fog. A golden paper emerged from the mist.

“What is this?” At the moment the golden paper appeared, Luo Tian’s mind trembled. But he soon showed disappointment.

Luo Tian seemed to have a disease; every time he saw a golden paper, he thought it was a fragment of the Epoch Book. But upon closer inspection, although this golden paper resembled the Epoch Book, it had a different aura—powerful and oppressive.

“Wum…” Hu Tianzong recited something in his mouth. Then he spat out a mist of blood, which landed on the golden paper. It gradually coalesced into a “Fate” seal on the golden paper.

“I know, this is the Mandate of the Epoch Lord!” Tong Yangjian’s eyes showed surprise. He hadn’t expected Hu Tianzong to possess such a treasure.

“The Epoch Lord subdues the nine heavens and ten earths. Once his decree is issued, no clan dares disobey! If this mandate was issued by the Epoch Lord himself, it would be truly rebellious. It’s said that the截天之主 once carved a mandate, directly killing an ancient clan!” Feng Yong’s face was shocked as he looked at the golden mandate floating in the barrier.

Under people’s astonished gaze, the mandate floated down and disappeared into Hu Tianzong’s body.

“Boom… boom… boom…” Thunderous sounds echoed. Hu Tianzong’s aura rose again, invisible waves radiating from his body.

“Epoch level!” Luo Tian felt Hu Tianzong’s strength rising at a terrifying speed.

“Now, what will you use to fight me?” Hu Tianzong’s face bore a sinister expression. He grabbed, and Epoch energy swept over his body, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“This is more like it!” Luo Tian’s blood seemed ignited. He tightened his grip on Wuyao Sword, showing no fear as he rushed toward Hu Tianzong. At the same time, the Divine King’s Nine Heavens Map descended from the sky, crushing toward Hu Tianzong.

Chapter 1255: Victory ()

The Divine King’s Nine Heavens Map, radiating terrifying pressure, instantly descended upon Hu Tianzong. Thunderous sounds echoed.

“Now you’re not my match!” Hu Tianzong felt unusually powerful. He gazed at the massive map and didn’t dodge, his fists filled with gray mist, smashing toward the map.

“Boom…”, like a thunderclap, violent waves battered the barrier. The massive map instantly collided with Hu Tianzong’s fist and shattered. Hu Tianzong’s body landed on the ground, with divine patterns rising from his feet and spreading outward.

“Only its surface!” Luo Tian’s face was cold. He appeared beside Hu Tianzong, his fists filled with black demonic energy, instantly smashing toward him.

Luo Tian could feel that Hu Tianzong’s aura was now at the Epoch level, but compared to a true early Epoch, it was still weaker. He had great confidence in winning.

“Get out…” Hu Tianzong roared, swinging his fist again to meet Luo Tian’s attack. Lightning crackled around them.

“Evenly matched!” Both men stepped back, then rushed toward each other again. The crowd was stunned.

“I won’t believe it! I still beat you!” Hu Tianzong’s eyes showed madness, as if determined to fight until the end.

Thunderous explosions echoed within the barrier. Luo Tian, like a demon god, his body unmatched, used Brahman Attack and “One Force Overcomes All” to face Hu Tianzong, who was empowered by the Mandate of the Epoch Lord. Yet he didn’t fall behind; in close combat, he even seemed to suppress Hu Tianzong.

Hu Tianzong’s body was filled with gray mist, colliding with Luo Tian. Each strike carried terrifying Epoch energy.

Their speed was so fast that the observers were dazzled. Terror-filled auras constantly battered the transparent barrier, and blood imbued with divinity spilled from both sides. Yet they seemed unaffected, continuously attacking each other to force the opponent into a state of blood regeneration—meaning their victory.

“This two, fighting like this, won’t they die?” Shen Gongfu’s fat face trembled as he spoke softly. He knew these two were invincible at the half-step Epoch level, even his fellow island leaders wouldn’t match them.

“No. Such a commotion would surely have Ice Ancestor’s attention. He wouldn’t let them perish completely!” Tong Yangjian, the first island leader, said with admiration.

“Hu Tianzong’s current state won’t last long. He gained this strength through special means!” Second island leader Feng Yong spoke, his voice filled with a sigh.

“It’s a pity for Hu Tianzong. He was always suppressed by Guan Xingjian. Now there’s this demon in Luo Tian!” Several island leaders shook their heads. Initially, they hadn’t believed in Luo Tian, but now they realized they were wrong.

“Boom… boom… boom…” Explosions echoed from the barrier. Luo Tian’s body was bloodied, his flesh covered in cracks. The cracks were filled with Epoch energy, making the wounds heal slowly. His ribs had broken and protruded from his body, looking terrifying.

Hu Tianzong was the same. His body was bloodied, his face pale to the point of almost being transparent. His skull had nearly been smashed by Luo Tian.

“Cough… cough…” As if they had a mutual understanding, both men slowed their movements. They locked eyes before attacking again.

Time passed slowly. The crowd’s eyes were wide, watching the two within the barrier, not missing any detail.

“Boom… boom…” After an hour of bloodshed, both men could no longer endure. Their cracked bodies crashed to the ground.

“Is it over? It’s a draw?” The crowd gasped as they saw both men lying on the ground.

“Ah…” Hu Tianzong wanted to roar, but his body felt like it wasn’t his own. He was completely drained.

“Why did I lose!” Hu Tianzong’s heart screamed, his eyes filled with resentment. He hadn’t expected to be beaten so thoroughly by Luo Tian.

At that moment, Hu Tianzong regretted deeply. If he had used his technique immediately when he fused the Mandate of the Epoch Lord, he would have subdued Luo Tian. But his pride made it hard to admit. He had gained a level through special means, and if he used his technique again, even if he won, he would be mocked by Guan Xingjian and Yang Jinghua. He could only fight Luo Tian with his body to salvage some of his dignity.

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian spat out two mouthfuls of blood, a smile on his face. His excitement was at its peak.

“Epoch level, that’s it?” Luo Tian wanted to roar into the sky but only spat out two mouthfuls of blood. His voice didn’t come out, instead causing him to cough violently.

“Whoever stands up first is the winner of this match!” It seemed both men had no more strength left. The crowd’s faces showed anticipation as they watched the two lying on the ground, waiting for one of them to rise.

The Seven Star Platform fell silent. Dust gradually settled on Luo Tian and Hu Tianzong’s bodies.

“Never mind, such a thrilling battle without a winner is fine!” Tong Yangjian sighed softly. He flew toward Luo Tian and Feng Yong, who had also moved.

“Not over yet!” Just as the two were about to move, a weary voice echoed in people’s ears. The crowd erupted in chaos, their eyes turning toward the source of the voice.

Green vitality spread. Luo Tian seemed to be bathed in infinite life, slowly standing up. His wounds healed at an observable speed.

“Such a fast recovery! This is the Reincarnation Body, isn’t it? Not only is his body unmatched, but his recovery speed is also absurd!” Several island leaders’ faces showed disbelief as they watched Luo Tian standing there.

Luo Tian’s eyes showed a hint of joy. He hadn’t expected to recover so quickly. He didn’t know why his severely injured body had unleashed infinite vitality, but this powerful vitality was rapidly repairing him.

“Immortal Tree of Life!” Luo Tian suddenly recalled. Perhaps it was the Immortal Tree of Life’s effect that made him recover so quickly.

“Wow…” Everyone gasped, watching Hu Tianzong still struggling to stand on the ground. They shook their heads, eyes filled with admiration.

Luo Tian took a step toward Hu Tianzong. Though his vitality was strong, he had been severely injured and had damaged his core. He estimated it would take at least a month to fully recover.

Luo Tian approached Hu Tianzong, looking down from above. His eyes showed a smile: “You lost!”

“Boom…” As Luo Tian’s words fell, his foot extended and slammed down on the severely injured Hu Tianzong. Blood splattered, flesh flew everywhere. Under people’s stunned gaze, Hu Tianzong’s body exploded into a cloud of blood on the Seven Star Platform.

“No!” Hu Jian’an and Hu Jianhua’s faces were filled with disbelief. They couldn’t believe Hu Tianzong had lost.

Blood slowly coalesced, and Hu Tianzong’s form reappeared before the crowd. His face was pale to the point of being transparent, gazing at Luo Tian surrounded by green vitality.

Luo Tian saw Hu Tianzong’s cultivation had dropped to the peak of the Saint level. He lightly shook his head, a smile on his face: “Surrender?”

Hu Tianzong took deep breaths. His eyes flashed with a hint of melancholy. Something felt blocked in his heart as he gazed at Luo Tian, his expression complex.

“Epoch level, I’ll fight you to wash away today’s shame!” Hu Tianzong, his face pale, jumped down from the Seven Star Platform. He returned to Hu Jian’an and Hu Jianhua’s side, leaving the crowd with them.

“Deputy Island Leader’s might!” The people of the third island shouted as they watched Luo Tian on the Seven Star Platform. After this battle, Luo Tian’s name was firmly established throughout the Seven Star Island. Even in people’s hearts, he had been placed at the same level as the top prodigy Guan Xingjian.

“Haha, Deputy Island Leader, congratulations!” Shen Gongfu rubbed his hands as he approached Luo Tian. His small eyes were filled with joy. He had clearly made a lot of money from this bet.

“Island Leader, can you take me to see our Seven Star Island’s preparations?” Luo Tian spoke directly, stating his request. He had fought hard and nearly lost to Hu Tianzong, breaking his undefeated record. All he wanted was to find a way back to the Nine Realms.

“Don’t worry. Since the other island leaders are here, with my eloquence, they’ll agree!” Shen Gongfu patted his large belly and took the bet.

“Luo Tian!” As he spoke, Tong Yangjian and Feng Yong, along with other island leaders, flew toward Luo Tian. Their eyes showed admiration as they looked at him.

“Respect the Island Leaders!” Luo Tian bowed to them, his eyes showing a hint of respect.

“Luo Tian, no need for such formalities. Your strength is evident; you’re no less than us. So there’s no need for this!” Tong Yangjian smiled as he spoke to Luo Tian.

“By the way, there’s one more thing I need your help with. I also told Shen Gongfu about it!” Tong Yangjian’s face showed a hint of joy, his eyes gazing at Luo Tian.

“Uh…” Shen Gongfu’s round face slightly changed. His small eyes blinked rapidly at Tong Yangjian.

Chapter 1256: The Seven Star Island’s Preparations ()

Although Shen Gongfu kept making faces at Tong Yangjian, the latter only gazed at Luo Tian, seemingly not noticing Shen Gongfu’s eyes.

“Here’s the thing. You know we’ve been researching how to return to the Nine Realms for a long time. I need your help looking into it. After all, you’re from the Nine Realms. Perhaps you’ll think of a way. I’m sure you also want to return to the Nine Realms!”

“Last time, you left in a hurry. And since you just arrived at the Seven Star Island, we didn’t know much about you yet. So we didn’t rush to show it to you!” Tong Yangjian’s face showed sincerity as he gazed at Luo Tian.

Hearing Tong Yangjian’s words, Luo Tian hadn’t expected it to be so smooth. He couldn’t refuse. Just as he was about to agree, he suddenly thought of something and gazed at Shen Gongfu. He saw Shen Gongfu still making faces at Tong Yangjian.

“Damn!” Luo Tian couldn’t help but curse inwardly. He gazed at Shen Gongfu, his eyes showing hostility.

Tong Yangjian’s words were clear—asking him to look. They had wanted him to see it all along. It was obvious Shen Gongfu hadn’t told the truth, tricking him into becoming deputy island leader and fighting against Hu Tianzong. He had clearly been used by Shen Gongfu.

“Um, I’ll go home first!” Shen Gongfu chuckled twice. His fat body instantly vanished from the crowd’s sight, making people doubt how such a fat person could move so fast.

“You’ll pay for this! This is the first time I’ve been tricked by someone!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, watching Shen Gongfu disappear. He felt like vomiting from frustration.

“Are you okay?” Tong Yangjian smiled, looking at Luo Tian. He felt Luo Tian’s face was grim and asked.

“Haha, Luo Tian, did you get tricked by Shen Gongfu?”

“Ah, no one on the Seven Star Island has escaped Shen Gongfu’s tricks. Even the Grand Island Leader and Second Island Leader have been tricked. You’ll get used to it eventually!” The fourth island leader smiled, patting Luo Tian’s shoulder.

“Want to consider coming to my Fourth Island?” The fourth island leader spoke, his voice as猥琐 as it could be.

“You’re not much better than Shen Gongfu!” Luo Tian looked at his eyes and knew this fourth island leader wasn’t much better.

“Do you want to rest for a while or go now?” Tong Yangjian asked Luo Tian, shaking his head lightly.

“Now, of course!” Luo Tian wouldn’t refuse. His eyes showed excitement. This was his chance to return to the Nine Realms; he wouldn’t miss it.

“Then good!” Tong Yangjian grabbed Luo Tian, and with several island leaders, they vanished from the Seven Star Island crowd’s sight.

“Do you think Luo Tian or Guan Xingjian is stronger?” After the island leaders and Luo Tian left, people started to chatter again. They were still reliving Luo Tian’s battle with Hu Tianzong.

“Don’t know when Guan Xingjian will return. It’s said he encountered a crisis, and an elder has gone to rescue him!” People chattered, their eyes filled with concern.

“Wum…” The displacement force spread. Luo Tian and six island leaders appeared outside a grand hall. The hall was massive, and within it, Luo Tian felt the aura of time.

“This is where the Seven Star Island’s ancestors have prepared to return to the Nine Realms!” Tong Yangjian’s face showed solemnity as he spoke.

“Creak…” Tong Yangjian respectfully opened the hall door, leading Luo Tian into it.

“Wum…” A moment later, Luo Tian’s vision suddenly darkened. He then showed a look of admiration, his eyes filled with solemnity.

His vision revealed the entire hall was dark, dotted with stars. For a moment, he felt as if he were in the domain beyond.

“This is a small world. It was created by generations of ancestors during their final moments.” Tong Yangjian’s face showed reverence, gazing into the starry void.

“Why have you come?” The moment Tong Yangjian’s words finished, a solemn voice echoed in their ears.

“Respect the Yun Ancestor!” The island leaders showed reverence, greeting the old man who walked from the starry void.

“Epoch Mid-level!” Luo Tian looked at the elder, his eyes filled with respect. He marveled at the Seven Star Island’s depth of power. He had seen a beast on the ice cliff before, and now he met another Epoch Mid-level powerhouse.

“Wum…” As Luo Tian bowed, his back glowed with golden light. Wuyao Sword emitted a series of hums.

“Wuyao Sword!” The next moment, the elder who was called Yun Ancestor by Tong Yangjian’s eyes glowed with light. He grabbed the sword, which instantly flew from Luo Tian’s back and landed in the elder’s hand.

“How did you obtain this Wuyao Sword?” The elder’s face showed authority. He gazed at Luo Tian, and a powerful pressure instantly enveloped him. Luo Tian’s body emitted creaking sounds.

“You know about Wuyao Sword?” Luo Tian’s face was cold with sweat. His already injured body was beginning to crack.

“More than knowing, this is my weapon! How could I not know!” The elder gently caressed the sword’s body, his face showing a hint of nostalgia.

“Are you Yun Wu’ya, the elder?” Luo Tian’s eyes sparkled. He thought of the name left behind by the one who taught him Wuyao Sword.

“Correct! Have you been to Nangling Stone寨? How is my old friend?” Yun Wu’ya’s face showed a hint of nostalgia as he spoke to Luo Tian.

“Not well!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly. He gazed at Yun Wu’ya, recounting what Shizhangshan had told him.

Yun Wu’ya listened to Luo Tian’s account of the current situation of the stone clan elder. The dark starry void was filled with violent killing intent.

“I ruined Shizhang寨! If I hadn’t been healing there, Tiantian wouldn’t have been captured by the蛮神殿!” Yun Wu’ya’s eyes showed self-reproach.
