“Crack...” Demonic energy surged as the black blade aura shattered violently, along with it, the first continent of the Divine King's Nine Heavens Map was annihilated.

“Second strike... Third strike...” As Luo Tian waved his hand, the remaining strikes of the Rebellious Seven Demon Blades erupted violently, colliding with the Divine King's Nine Heavens Map.

“Boom... Boom... Boom...” Thunderous roars echoed repeatedly. Six blade auras, each stronger than the last, shattered one continent after another.

“Blocked!” People's faces bore awe as they gazed at Luo Tian, whose demonic energy surged uncontrollably. They hadn't expected the Divine Clan's three divine arts to be halted by Luo Tian.

“Did you create these Seven Demon Blades? Excellent, truly excellent!” The Demonic Lord's face broke into a smile as he addressed Nan Gong Bo behind him, openly praising.

“Now it's my turn!” While people marveled at Luo Tian's prowess, Luo Tian's hands moved swiftly. A verdant green fire dragon erupted from his grasp, roaring as it enveloped Sun Miechen.

“Divine Flame!” Sun Miechen's face darkened. His gaze fell upon the crystalline jade fire surrounding him, sensing its profound difference from the divine flames he had encountered before.

“Fen Tian's Inferno Array!” Luo Tian thrust his hands into the void, and the verdant flames exploded violently. Scorching heat instantly swept over people's minds.

“Great Dao Sealing Demon!” Terrifying temperatures enveloped Sun Miechen. Simultaneously, the Great Dao's power merged with golden sacred energy, surging into the crystalline jade fire.

“Ugh...” A mournful sound echoed as the verdant flames instantly obscured people's vision, surrounding Sun Miechen.

“This divine flame has evolved!” The Divine King of the Divine Clan could no longer remain seated. He slowly rose, gazing at Sun Miechen wrapped in flames.

“Ah...” A harrowing cry echoed. The scent of charred flesh spread through the air, leaving people's faces awestruck.

“Not immortal and unkillable? I'll see how you achieve that!” Luo Tian channeled sacred energy and Great Dao power into the crystalline jade fire relentlessly.

Harsh cries echoed repeatedly. Luo Tian felt Sun Miechen being continuously refined within the flames.

“Stop!” Sun Shengtian, the Divine King of the Divine Clan, could no longer remain seated. He too sensed Sun Miechen's power waning irreversibly.

Sun Shengtian extended his hand, a golden giant hand seizing the verdant flames. The Fen Tian's Inferno Array shattered violently, scattering into green flames that flowed through the golden fingers before coalescing and piercing Luo Tian's body.

Luo Tian flickered, instantly appearing before a charred Sun Miechen. His foot shot out, crushing the weakened Sun Miechen's body.

“Boom...” Luo Tian stomped on Sun Miechen's form, landing on the ground. Though his face was pale, his aura remained formidable.

Chapter 1117: Who Will You Choose?

On the Divine Clan's plaza, Luo Tian bore a pale expression as he gazed at the Divine King Sun Shengtian in the sky.

“You truly dared to strike. I underestimated you. Today, you won't leave the Divine Clan!” Sun Shengtian's face bore a faint smile, yet his voice was cold.

“Unleash all your tricks!” Sun Shengtian didn't wait for Luo Tian's rebuttal, continuing from his lofty position. He doubted Luo Tian had no tricks. A single Luo Tian, though powerful, could be eradicated with a mere flick of his hand—nothing remarkable.

“I haven't lost! You can't kill me!” A low voice echoed. Sun Miechen reappeared intact before the crowd, though his face was pale, clearly wounded.

“Indeed, the Immortal Body of Eternity. You still remained unscathed!” Yan Hongtao and others felt shaken, watching Sun Miechen before the Divine King. Their gazes held deep apprehension.

They were all prodigies of their time. From the moment Luo Tian and Sun Miechen clashed, they sensed Sun Miechen's strength. Especially his seemingly indestructible nature left them troubled. They knew Sun Miechen had underestimated Luo Tian's crystalline jade fire.

“Enough. Today is your joyous day. What kind of state is this?” Sun Shengtian's brow furrowed slightly, speaking softly.

“Sun Shengtian fears!” Yan Xiuluo and Zhou Tianxing among the domain masters felt a shift, discerning Sun Shengtian's intent.

“Today I grant Cao Yuanshan a favor. If you depart now, I'll overlook this. But if you persist in your folly, don't blame me for harsh measures!” Sun Shengtian spoke like a sovereign, his voice domineering.

Luo Tian's face darkened. His gaze fell on Sun Shengtian, the half-step Epoch Master. Even if he fought with all his might, he couldn't match him. Sun Shengtian's pressure was overwhelming.

“Divine King, please spare this child!” Sun Hexi and Sun Mengru descended from the sky, kneeling before Sun Shengtian to plead for Luo Tian.

“Sun Hexi, do you think my temper has softened? I won't harm you. Repeatedly provoking my patience?” Sun Shengtian's brow furrowed, reprimanding Sun Hexi.

“Not at all. However, Sun Mengru is regarded as my granddaughter. Please, Divine King, on the merit of my years of service to the Divine Clan, cancel this marriage!” Sun Hexi knelt on the ground, devoid of the grandeur of a Divine Clan elder. He appeared like an old man on his deathbed.

Sun Mengru stood before Sun Hexi, her heart torn. She gazed at Sun Shengtian, seeing a fleeting glint of killing intent in his eyes. She shielded Sun Hexi behind her.

“Sun Mengru, do you also wish to leave with this man?” Sun Shengtian's gaze deepened as he addressed her.

Hearing this, Sun Mengru fell silent. Her eyes held complexity. How could she not wish to leave with Luo Tian? After a lifetime of searching, he had found her. What hardship!

But this was the Divine Clan. Sun Mengru knew their strength. If she truly nodded, she would die instantly.

“Haha! Good! Sun Mengru, I now give you two choices!”

“First, obediently marry Sun Miechen. The Divine Clan is magnanimous; we'll overlook this. You will remain a Divine Clan's divine maiden, and your children shall surely become the future ruler of the Divine Clan!”

“Second, choose to betray the Divine Clan and leave with this man. Naturally, you know the consequences!” The Divine King Sun Shengtian gazed at Sun Mengru.

Sun Mengru's gaze flickered between Luo Tian and Sun Hexi. A simple truth: if she betrayed the Divine Clan, the Divine King would surely kill Luo Tian. Both would die. If she remained in the Divine Clan, perhaps due to Cao Yuanshan's favor, Luo Tian might survive.

Suddenly, Sun Mengru felt as if she had returned to that past choice. The situation mirrored the Flying Cloud Sect's ordeal. Even after a lifetime of reincarnation, she faced this impossible dilemma again.

On one hand was her beloved; on the other, his life. And likely, she would drag Sun Hexi into this. She could die with Luo Tian, but Sun Hexi couldn't. Sun Hexi had raised her for so long; how could she let him die with her?

“I choose the first!” Sun Mengru's eyes glistened with tears, her voice trembling as it escaped her lips.

“What?” Luo Tian stood frozen. His gaze fell on Sun Mengru, his eyes filled with disbelief. He felt as if struck by lightning.

Blood trickled from Luo Tian's lips. His entire being seemed to have been severed from his soul. He hadn't expected this outcome after waiting so long.

“Luo Tian...” Nan Gong Yuqing's face was equally grim. He flew to Luo Tian's side, concern in his gaze. He knew how painful Luo Tian felt.

“Impossible!” Luo Tian's eyes reddened as he gazed at Sun Mengru, shouting at her. He flew toward her.

“Boom...” Before Luo Tian reached Sun Mengru, the Divine King Sun Shengtian let out a cold snort. A powerful pressure instantly halted Luo Tian's form, sending him crashing to the ground.

“Cough...” Luo Tian rose, coughing up two mouthfuls of blood. His face grew paler. Gazing at Sun Mengru, he saw the intense pity in her eyes and finally understood what she was thinking.

“Stupid girl!” Luo Tian's eyes bore a bitter smile as he slowly approached Sun Mengru, his gaze tender.

“Luo Tian, don't overstep. I'm not killing you because of Cao Yuanshan's favor. But if you push further, you'll die!” Sun Shengtian waved his hand, gazing at Luo Tian with a deep expression, sending him flying again.

“I said today no one can block me!” Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with determination. A blue token appeared in his hand.

Golden runes were infused into the Heaven's Palace Token, sending powerful ripples through people's perceptions. A black door slowly opened, and eighteen voices of immense power emerged into view.

“They?” People's faces bore confusion. They didn't know these eighteen people's identities, but they knew they were no ordinary figures.

Time passed. The ancient Heaven's Palace's eighteen individuals' cultivation levels soared. The weakest was at the late Saint stage, and during this time, two more reached the peak of the Saint stage.

“Four at the peak of Saint? A dozen at late Saint? Not bad, but still insufficient before me!” The Divine King's face shifted slightly. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to have such a terrifying force behind him.

Yet Sun Shengtian wasn't overly concerned. Even with four peak Saint masters, he had no fear. After all, he was a half-step Epoch Master—perhaps even capable of breaking into the Epoch realm.

“Then what about me?” As Sun Shengtian's words finished, a deep voice echoed. Purple energy spread across the entire Divine Mountain, purple seas surging as an ancient figure stepped over the waves and appeared before them.

“Cao Yuanshan!” Hearing this voice, Sun Shengtian's face finally changed. He gazed at the purple-robed elder who had appeared before them.

“Cao Yuanshan, you came...” Several domain masters were about to greet him but their faces immediately shifted.

“You... advanced?” Even the Divine King Sun Shengtian bore intense shock. He hadn't expected Cao Yuanshan to have advanced into the early Epoch realm.

“Fortuitous.” Cao Yuanshan lightly shook his head. He had only just advanced and hadn't fully stabilized his cultivation, yet he had rushed here.

Sun Shengtian's domain masters felt a bitter taste. Looking at Cao Yuanshan, in terms of lineage, he was about one generation younger than them. Yet they hadn't expected him to break through the constraints and enter the early Epoch realm.

“My heavens! An early Epoch master!” People trembled completely. In the current nine domains, Cao Yuanshan was perhaps the only remaining early Epoch master within people's sight.

“Luo Tian, from now on, you can walk proudly!” People's eyes bore envy as they gazed at Luo Tian, finally turning their attention to Cao Yuanshan.

“Divine King, please consider my favor and let them be together!” Cao Yuanshan bowed to Sun Shengtian.

“Your cultivation hasn't fully stabilized yet. And you were injured during your Epoch trial. Still, you dare to come here and beg for favor? You're quite confident!” Sun Shengtian's surprise faded quickly, but his gaze held no fear.

“Cao Yuanshan, do you truly think that with your early Epoch power alone, you can roam freely in my Divine Clan?” Sun Shengtian continued, his voice resolute.

“Of course not. However, Luo Tian is my favored disciple. If the Divine King refuses, I'll have no choice but to fight!” Though Cao Yuanshan was slightly lower in rank than the domain masters, his demeanor and boldness were no less. His words were resolute.

“Good, good, good! Cao Yuanshan, come. I want to see what qualifications you have to roam freely in my Divine Clan. By the way, did you bring out your clan's Demon Emperor Mirror?” Sun Shengtian's face bore a cold expression as he scrutinized Cao Yuanshan.

“Divine King, are you about to use your Divine Clan's Epoch Treasure?” Hearing Sun Shengtian's words, Yan Xiuluo and others' faces changed.

Epoch Treasures. If truly activated, they might all suffer consequences.

Chapter 1118: The Clash of Epoch Treasures

On the Divine Clan's plaza, people murmured. Their gazes fell on Sun Shengtian, who bore confidence in the sky. Even the domain masters' faces were grim.

“Divine Emperor Sword!” Sun Shengtian roared, his cultivation power erupting. His hands formed golden light, slicing through the void and vanishing from sight.

“Buzz...” As Sun Shengtian's runes merged into the void, a powerful pressure instantly swept over people's minds. Everyone felt an immense pressure hidden in the void—destructive, capable of annihilating the entire Divine Mountain.

“Sun Shengtian, think carefully. The consequences of using an Epoch Treasure are dire!” Cao Yuanshan's face darkened, his gaze deep.

Cao Yuanshan had just passed the Epoch trial. His cultivation was unstable, and he'd been severely wounded during the Epoch trial. Yet he still felt confident. These domain masters weren't his opponents. This was the might of an early Epoch master—absolute dominance over any half-step Epoch.

But against an Epoch Treasure, Cao Yuanshan knew he couldn't withstand it. Even if he survived the first strike of an Epoch Treasure, he wouldn't survive the second.

“Sun Shengtian, stay calm!” Yan Xiuluo and others bore shock. If Cao Yuanshan died here, the Demon Clan would go mad. It wouldn't be as simple as Yan Xiuluo seizing the Epoch Book last time. The Demon Clan would surely launch a full-scale war against the Divine and Demon Realms.

“Divine Clan must not be insulted! Unless you now take this man and leave, there's no way!” Sun Shengtian was resolute. His sky-piercing sword intent enveloped the entire Divine Mountain.

“No retreat! No one can block me!” Luo Tian roared, his hands moving swiftly. He soared into the sky, golden runes erupting from his body and forming a golden key, which he inserted into the void.

“Boom...” As Luo Tian inserted the golden key into the void, thunderous roars echoed throughout the Divine Mountain.

In the vast cosmos of the Divine and Demon Realms, golden palaces roared forth. The heavy pressure, even across the cosmos, was felt on the Divine Mountain, causing people to gasp in awe.

The clamor began. Golden light rose from the Divine Mountain, a golden long sword forming a brilliant streak, slicing through the void and instantly appearing outside the Divine Mountain's cosmos.

“Divine Emperor Sword!” Cao Yuanshan's face bore shock, gazing at the fleeting sword before turning to Sun Shengtian.

“Sun Shengtian, are you really about to use an Epoch Treasure?” Yan Xiuluo and others shouted, gazing at Sun Shengtian.

“Donkey's ass! It's not me controlling the Divine Emperor Sword. The sword was drawn by itself from our ancestral temple!” Sun Shengtian's face darkened. His gaze pierced the void, discovering the golden palace outside.

“That's it! The Ancient Heaven Palace!” Sun Shengtian's words hadn't finished when Yan Xiuluo and the other domain masters' faces shifted, gazing at the Ancient Heaven Palace confronting the Divine Emperor Sword.

“Could it be Luo Tian? The key he just released was to open the Ancient Heaven Palace. Did he subdue it? How is that possible!” Zhou Tianxing of the Starry Domain domain master exclaimed, his eyes filled with shock.

Hearing these domain masters' dialogue, the elders and senior disciples from various sects attending the wedding gasped. They gazed at Luo Tian, astonished that he had such an extraordinary opportunity to obtain the ancient palace.

“Crack...” As people marveled at Luo Tian's formidable backup, golden long sword clashed with the Ancient Heaven Palace in the sky.

The thunderous roar caused the entire Divine Clan's continent to tremble. Stars fell, violent waves spread across the cosmos, sweeping over the Divine Clan's continent. The sky of the Divine Clan seemed to be torn open, with countless stars annihilated by the clash between the Ancient Heaven Palace and the Divine Emperor Sword. Vast meteor showers collided with the Divine Clan's continent, as if the world had ended.

“These two Epoch Treasures, if they clash on the Divine Clan's continent, it would also be destroyed!” Yan Xiuluo and Zhou Tianxing's faces bore fear. After so many years, they finally felt fear.

“Sun Shengtian, will you continue?” Cao Yuanshan gazed at the Divine King, awaiting his reply.

Sun Shengtian's face was grim. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to possess the ancient palace. Yet now he was stuck, for if he truly let Luo Tian take Sun Mengru away, how could the Divine Clan stand?

“This should be my question to you. With the Divine Emperor Sword's constraint, the Ancient Heaven Palace can't harm my Divine Clan. Do you truly believe you can leave my Divine Clan unscathed?” Sun Shengtian's gaze was cold, scanning Cao Yuanshan and Luo Tian along with the eighteen powerful figures behind him.

“I know your Divine Clan's depth. Today, I'll summon my two depths to eliminate you all!” Sun Shengtian's face bore cruelty. His hands moved swiftly, golden blood erupting from his hands and entering the Divine Mountain.

“Sun Shengtian has gone mad!” Yan Xiuluo and others looked at Sun Shengtian as if they didn't recognize him, watching him infuse blood into the Divine Mountain.

“What are you all staring at? They've attacked our doorstep!” Sun Shengtian barked at the Divine Clan's disciples.

“Divine Clan must not be insulted!” The Divine Clan's disciples bore killing intent, gazing at Luo Tian and others. They all slashed their fingers, blood erupting from their hands and dripping onto the Divine Mountain.

“Buzz...” Waves spread. Drips of blood coalesced into a river, spreading across the Divine Mountain.

Sun Shengtian's gaze was cold. His hands moved swiftly, extending them to grasp the blood river, splitting it into two and forming two crimson dragons. Roaring, he thrust them into the Divine Mountain.

“Ancestors, enemies have attacked our Divine Mountain with an Epoch Treasure. Please appear and eradicate the invaders!” Sun Shengtian knelt in the sky, forming two runes which vanished into the Divine Mountain.

“Cao Yuanshan, I'll test your strength as a newly promoted early Epoch master!” Sun Shengtian finished these actions, gazing at Cao Yuanshan. He raised the Divine King's Nine Heavens Map, pressing it toward Cao Yuanshan.

“Hmph! Sun Shengtian, don't think I fear you. Even if I fall in your Divine Clan's depths, I'll send you to your grave first!” Cao Yuanshan resolutely replied. Purple energy surged, and he soared into the sky without using any martial arts. His hands struck repeatedly, countering the Divine King's Nine Heavens Map.

“Divine Clan disciples, listen! Eliminate these intruders!” Sun Shengtian's gaze was cold as he addressed the Divine Clan's millions of disciples and elders.

“Kill!” A roar echoed throughout the Divine Mountain, as each disciple instantly surrounded Luo Tian and others. Their gazes were cold, among them several with the strength of late Saint stage.

“Damn it! Luo Tian, you bastard actually attacked the Divine Clan. This is suicide!” The eighteen men, still recovering from their shock, cursed loudly.

“Respected elders, if you don't wish to help me, choose to leave!” Luo Tian's face bore a bitter smile. He hadn't expected things to reach this point.

Originally, Luo Tian had only intended to summon the Ancient Heaven Palace to intimidate. Yet two pseudo-Epoch Treasures had感应ed each other, clashing on their own.

“Never mind. We've never emerged before. Now we're facing the Divine Clan, it's quite astonishing!” The eighteen men bore no fear but excitement, gazing at the Divine Clan surrounding them.

“Killing so many people is impossible. We must choose to break through. Brothers, prepare!” Zeng Tianshou's gaze was deep as he transmitted to the seventeen others.

“Luo Tian, follow us. We might not care about you!” Zeng Tianshou was concerned for Luo Tian, advising him.

“Afraid?” Luo Tian grabbed Sun Mengru's hand, his face gentle. He gazed at the sea of people surrounding them—both Divine Clan disciples and many sect elders and princes from the Divine and Demon Realms.

“Not afraid. I've died once; dying again is nothing!” Sun Mengru smiled lightly, allowing Luo Tian to hold her as they stood behind Zeng Tianshou and others.

“Kill!” Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhenguang, four late Saint stage masters, led the charge. Luo Tian followed behind, charging through the ocean of people.

“Mengru, take care of yourself. Grandpa can't protect you anymore!” As they prepared to move, Sun Hexi suddenly turned back, leaving Luo Tian's group.

“Grandpa, come here! We'll be fine!” Sun Mengru's face paled as she saw Sun Hexi leave the group. She vaguely understood his intention.

“I'll do it. I'm still a Divine Clan member. Killing the Divine Clan's disciples, I can't do it!” Sun Hexi lightly shook his head. He stood still, gazing at Sun Mengru with tenderness.

“And you, I've always regarded as my granddaughter. Let me kill you, and I'll do it. Only death might be the best path for me!” Sun Hexi transmitted to Sun Mengru.

“Luo Tian, I entrust my granddaughter to you. If she suffers even a little, I'll never forgive you. Take her and live!” Sun Hexi's voice echoed. He raised his aged hand, activating late Saint stage cultivation without hesitation and striking his head.

“Boom...” His body disintegrated, even his soul shattered under Sun Hexi's strike.

“No…” Sun Mengru roared, rushing toward the disintegrated Sun Hexi like a madwoman.

Chapter 1119: The Unveiling of the Depths

On the Divine Clan's mountain, the disciples rushed like madmen, regardless of cultivation level, all charging toward Luo Tian and others.

But when they reached Sun Hexi's front, they all halted. Their gazes fell on the man who had smashed himself to pieces.

The Divine Clan's Grand Elder, Sun Hexi. No one in the Divine Clan didn't know him. Seeing his suicide now, their eyes bore a mix of sorrow and reverence.

Sun Mengru roared, instantly rushing to Sun Hexi's front. Tears flowed down her cheeks.

Luo Tian moved swiftly, appearing before Sun Mengru. His eyes bore admiration as he gazed at the shattered Sun Hexi, feeling a sudden respect for him.

“Mengru!” Luo Tian embraced her, his eyes filled with sorrow. Sun Hexi was the only tether Sun Mengru had in the Divine Clan. His death left her heartbroken.

But as Luo Tian and Sun Mengru separated from Zeng Tianshou's group, they were completely surrounded by the Divine Clan.

“It was me who killed Grandpa! It's my fault. He didn't want to trouble me, so he chose death!” Sun Mengru's face bore a bittersweet smile. Her eyes were lifeless.

“Alas…” Luo Tian knew she was in no state to recover. He waved his hand, collecting her and rising slowly.

“Luo Tian! It's all because of you. If not for you, our Divine Clan wouldn't be in such chaos today. You must die!” The Divine Clan disciples roared, charging toward Luo Tian with martial arts.

By chance, although Luo Tian and Sun Mengru had left Zeng Tianshou's group, they had also drawn most of the Divine Clan's masters.

Luo Tian's highest opponent was only at the early Saint stage, no match for him.

“Kill!” Luo Tian knew his true test had begun. If he could escape before the Divine Clan's depths awakened, it would be a success. Otherwise, he'd die for sure.

Thinking this through, Luo Tian held nothing back. The Great Dao Sealing Fist continuously swung, each strike killing dozens of Divine Clan disciples.

Meanwhile, Zeng Tianshou and the eighteen men were even more formidable. Like a sharp arrow, they charged toward the Divine Clan's domain.

Chaos erupted across the Divine Mountain. Above, Shrouded Domain, Demon Clan, and Starry Domain's people stood together without joining the battle. Their gazes were deep as they watched Sun Shengtian and Cao Yuanshan's battle.

“There must be another secret. A Primordial Body isn't worth Sun Shengtian's effort!” Yan Xiuluo furrowed his brow, speaking to the others.

“Indeed. Paying such a heavy price, even using the clan's depths, to keep a Primordial Body. It doesn't make sense!” The Chaos Domain Master sighed.

“Great chaos is about to begin!” Starry Domain Master Zhou Tianxing furrowed his brow, eyes filled with calculation.

Hearing Zhou Tianxing's words, the others fell silent. Their gazes bore heavier concern. Each domain's depths were profound; they had long known this era might be different.

“Boom...” The most concerning thing for them was the clash of two Epoch Treasures outside the Divine Clan's continent. Each collision sent waves, shaking the cosmos. Even they, great masters, dared not leave the Divine Clan's continent for fear of being caught in the waves.

“Epoch Treasures are truly terrifying. I don't know how many years it's been since two pseudo-Epoch Treasures clashed. This is even without anyone commanding them. If truly commanded by an Epoch Master, their clash might annihilate the Divine Clan's continent!” The others bore a sigh.

“Grand Elder, I'll go help Luo Tian!” Nan Gong Yuqing's face bore anxiety as he watched the surrounded Luo Tian.

After so long, Luo Tian hadn't moved a step. His surroundings were littered with corpses. Yet he wasn’t much better, his body bloodied as if in a frenzy, continuously striking with martial arts to kill the Divine Clan's disciples.

“Luo Tian! Your life!” As Luo Tian mechanically killed, a golden light appeared before him. Sun Miechen, the Immortal Body of Eternity and son of the Divine King, charged toward Luo Tian.

“Go!” The Demonic Lord knew Sun Miechen's strength. One Sun Miechen was already a challenge for Luo Tian. Add the countless Divine Clan disciples surrounding him, and it was miraculous that Luo Tian had lasted this long. A regular late Saint would have died instantly under their attack.

“Buzz...” Hearing the Demonic Lord's approval, Nan Gong Yuqing's gaze turned icy. He recalled his father’s death rumors tied to the Divine Clan.

With old and new grudges, Nan Gong Yuqing was reckless. His blood-red sword surged, activating the Demon-Crushing Heaven's Array. Dozens of super-early Saint and early Saint disciples were killed by Nan Gong Yuqing.

The Demonic Lord pointed his finger, sending Nan Gong Yuqing to Luo Tian's side. If he relied on himself alone, it would take years to reunite with Luo Tian.

“Demonic Lord, are you interfering?” Yan Xiuluo's face bore a smile as he gazed at the Demonic Lord beside him.

“Indeed, the Divine Clan has been too much. They schemed against my Demon Clan's Grand Elder. And Luo Tian is also a guest elder of the Demon Clan. Helping him isn't a big deal!” The Demon Lord remained calm. He not only intended to intervene but also ensure Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing's safety.

Luo Tian gazed at Sun Miechen charging toward him, his eyes filled with mockery. He struck a fist, colliding with Sun Miechen.

“Boom...” Both retreated, but Sun Miechen's face changed. Previously wounded by the crystalline jade fire, his strength had declined. Now facing Luo Tian's desperate fight, he was no match.

But Luo Tian was surrounded. Though he had repelled Sun Miechen, he couldn't dodge the other disciples' attacks.

“Boom...” Thousands of martial arts surged with immense power, breaking through the sky and sweeping toward Luo Tian.

“Go...” Luo Tian's long hair flew, his robes constantly agitated. The Great Dao Sealing Fist continuously struck, defeating countless martial arts with its overwhelming power. Combined with his unparalleled body strength, he faced the sky-shattering, world-destroying martial arts storm without fear.

“Boom...” The storm swept over Luo Tian. He continuously struck, each punch reducing the storm's power slightly. Yet his cost was immense—his body seemed flayed, divine blood flowing constantly, turning him into a bloody figure.

“Go!” Luo Tian roared. His gaze was resolute, looking ahead. The Heaven-Defying Bow appeared in his hand. He drew the bow and shot three arrows without hesitation.

Three black demon arrows, like death's sickles, pierced through the Divine Clan disciples, continuously harvesting their lives.

The three arrows tore a path through the surrounding Divine Clan disciples, giving Luo Tian time to escape.

At the moment the three arrows flew out, Luo Tian activated the Ghost Step of the Netherworld and followed the arrows outside. As for Nan Gong Yuqing, he didn't care. He knew the Demon Lord wouldn't let Nan Gong Yuqing die.

“Escaped?” Yan Hongtao and others, who hadn't been affected, gazed at the fierce Luo Tian escaping the Divine Clan's many encirclements. Their faces bore shock.

“Left?” The Demonic Lord's gaze flickered. He pointed his finger, pulling Nan Gong Yuqing back to him. His gaze returned to the battle between Cao Yuanshan and Sun Shengtian above.

Above, Sun Shengtian's face was pale. Vast purple energy continuously surrounded Cao Yuanshan, who struck repeatedly with his hands, hitting Sun Shengtian's body.

Though Sun Shengtian was the Divine King, enduring this long against an early Epoch master was already extraordinary. A half-step Epoch and an early Epoch were fundamentally different, impossible to reverse. Sun Shengtian was only enduring due to the Divine Clan's three divine arts and Cao Yuanshan not killing him.

Meanwhile, outside the Divine Clan's continent, two Epoch Treasures clashed repeatedly. Overwhelming pressure swept across the Divine Clan's land, mountains and rivers collapsing. The entire Divine Clan's continent seemed to fall into apocalyptic chaos.

Chaos engulfed the entire Divine Clan's land. Only Yan Xiuluo and Zhou Tianxing watched this earth-shattering battle, never expecting it to reach such a point. Even the Divine Clan's depths had been awakened.

Shouts of battle echoed. Zeng Tianshou and Zhou Zhenguang's eighteen men, like sharp arrows, tore through the Divine Clan's encirclement and appeared at the domain's edge. Yet they hadn't left. All eighteen were bloodied, their bodies marked with wounds. Their gazes were weak.

Catastrophic. These eighteen had once been prodigies. Now, they looked so pitiful. If not for their strength and默契 (coordination), they would have perished under the Divine Clan's encirclement. After all, the Divine Clan had masters at the peak of Saint stage. They had encountered three and wounded two, killing one.

“Where's Luo Tian?” The eighteen men took a breath and immediately searched for Luo Tian.

“Boom...” A deep sound echoed. Beneath the Divine Clan's land, a series of thunderous roars resounded. Below the ground, an altar had dozens of elders seated in meditation, like statues with no life.

Blood flowed into the altar, entering two elders' bodies. They slowly opened their eyes: “Who dared to offend our Divine Clan? Why have you awakened us?”
