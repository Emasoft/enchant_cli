"Mid-Bone Dissolution Stage? How dare you target us?" Chai Xiangming sneered, his face filled with contempt. Though he was at the Ninth Stage of Body Refinement within the sect, none of those in the Mid-Bone Dissolution Stage treated him with anything but respect.

"Hmph... If I were outside, what would you be?" Hunji coldly gazed at the group, his eyes brimming with deep disdain.

"Kill!" After a brief respite, the group's faces darkened at Hunji's mockery. They re-activated their martial arts and charged toward him again.

"Let's wear him down! He's never left the domain, so he must have no recovery pills on him!" Pang Haoran roared, no longer holding back as they unleashed their ultimate techniques.

"Lightweight Deflection" Chen Changsheng's three disciples from the Water Source Temple moved with fluid grace, their staffs swaying gently. Yet beneath this delicate attack lurked terrifying power.

"Seven Steps of Sealing the Heavens, Starfall Wood Kill!" Leng Qiuchan and her four companions vanished into the void, forming a triangular formation. They seemed fused as one, like an unyielding blade piercing through obstacles toward Hunji.

"Divine Heaven's Finger!"

"Sealing Demon Palm!"

Chai Xiangming and Feng Tianxiong also unleashed their ultimate martial arts against Hunji.

Luotian observed the group's formidable attacks with grim determination. Though he believed his body was strong, he doubted he could withstand the combined assault of these dozen warriors—each a genius capable of clashing with Mid-Bone Dissolution Stage masters.

While thinking, his Cracking Heaven Spear remained in motion. The spear twisted through the air, five elements' energies swirling along its length. A golden serpent roared toward Hunji, the strongest technique he could currently wield—Five Elements Mutual Generation, Golden Snake's Wild Dance.

Dozens of martial arts clashed like a storm against the eighth level of the Locking Spirit Pagoda, each explosion shaking the air. Hunji's calm expression darkened slightly as his body was locked in place by these attacks.

This was Hunji's lack of combat experience within the domain. His energy had been forcibly extracted from beasts by an old man's secret method, creating inevitable drawbacks. Otherwise, the world would have countless Bone Dissolution Stage masters.

"Boom..." A surge of power radiated from Hunji's body. Even the Mid-Bone Dissolution Stage master could barely withstand these combined attacks, his lips bleeding as his upper garments were torn away by the martial arts' force.

A wall of dust rose, obscuring sight. Tuyuanzheng and others grimaced as they stared at the swirling dust, their expressions filled with shock. They could clearly sense these attacks hadn't dealt fatal damage. Though obscured, Luotian's Ninth Stage Body Refinement strength remained evident through his presence—a terrifying aura forming around him.

"This still doesn't kill him!" Tuyuanzheng's face darkened.

"Strong! This is a Bone Dissolution Stage beginner? Even without martial arts and forced to this level through secret methods, it's already so strong. How much stronger would a true Mid-Bone Dissolution Stage master be?" Pang Haoran's face was as dark as storm clouds.

Luotian's expression remained grim. He had believed himself capable of killing a Bone Dissolution Stage beginner before, but with Feng Tianbu's strength and increased energy, he thought himself capable of clashing with a Mid-Bone Dissolution Stage master. Now it was clear he had been mistaken.

A wave of exhaustion spread through the group, their morale plummeting. They couldn't think of any way to defeat Hunji.

Unless they used the sect's secret methods or burned their blood for temporary power, but such costs were too great.

Yet they weren't overly concerned about their lives. As sect prodigies, each had protective measures. Even a Mid-Bone Dissolution Stage attack wouldn't be fatal, let alone one from the Bone Dissolution Peak.

Of course, it was their prodigy status that made them reluctant to use these methods. These treasures were precious even to Bone Dissolution Peak and Yuanling Stage masters.

"Such is your so-called talent from the outside. You've truly angered me!" Hunji's cold voice echoed.

The dust cleared, revealing Hunji's upper body adorned with black runes. His icy gaze swept over the group.

Chapter 227: Crushing

"Then it's my turn now!" Hunji's cold voice felt like a gust of wind through their hearts.

"Who should I start with?" Hunji's gaze swept over the group, a predatory expression on his face as if he could easily devour them. His lips curled slightly.

Hearing Hunji's words, the group's faces turned cautious. Their eyes locked onto Hunji, fearing he'd attack them first. With their energy depleted, evading a Mid-Bone Dissolution Stage assault would be difficult.

Hunji's gaze fell on Luotian, a slight smile forming: "I can sense your strength. I'll save you for last!"

Luotian's face showed no relief, only cautious vigilance toward Hunji.

Others knew they needed to unite for any chance. Otherwise, being picked off one by one would leave them even more vulnerable. They exchanged glances, subtly drawing closer.

"Hmph!" Hunji's cold snort echoed as he vanished from sight, like a whirlwind. In an instant, he appeared before them.

"Too fast!" Luotian felt Hunji's figure flicker. Without his spiritual awareness, he wouldn't have tracked Hunji's speed.

"Boom..." A simple punch.

This fist carried terrifying black energy, as if it could devour everything. Its target was Zhuang Shengjie, who had just finished a fierce battle but remained remarkably unscathed, his robes still pristine.

"Boom!" Zhuang Shengjie hadn't reacted in time. In less than a breath, he was sent flying, spitting blood that stained his white robes. He crashed into Ying Yingtou's side.

Seeing Zhuang Shengjie fall beside him, Ying Yingtou—just recovering—showed great alarm. He knew Zhuang Shengjie's strength was slightly superior to his own, but Ying Yingtou hadn't expected Zhuang Shengjie to suffer the same fate as himself.

"He didn't use his full strength!" Ying Yingtou's face showed disbelief, gazing at Hunji adorned with black runes.

Others felt their hearts tremble as they recalled that punch. They wondered if they could have withstood it, their thoughts turning bitter.

"Alas... who will be next?" Hunji's gaze swept over the group.

When his eyes fell on Leng Qiuchan, a look of surprise crossed his face. He licked his lips: "I hadn't noticed before. There's a woman here. I'll keep you for my clan to continue our lineage!"

"I'm sure your child would be incredibly powerful!" Hunji's voice echoed as he vanished from sight.

"You!" Leng Qiuchan's face turned icy at Hunji's words.

Her three companions also bore killing intent, stepping in front of her.

"Can you withstand it?" Leng Qiuchan's cold voice echoed as Hunji appeared before them, throwing three punches.

Leng Qiuchan's companions met the same fate as Zhuang Shengjie, spitting blood and crashing into the door.

Ignoring the three figures flying like broken kites, Hunji's cruel smile turned toward Leng Qiuchan's veil, eager to see the face beneath.

"Seven Steps of Sealing the Heavens!" Leng Qiuchan's feet generated a surge of energy, her body instinctively appearing several zhang away.

"Hmph?" Hunji's hand grasped empty air, surprise flashing across his face before he smiled again. His body reappeared opposite Leng Qiuchan.

"Can you escape?" Hunji spoke again.

"Chasing me? Dream on!" Leng Qiuchan sneered, using Seven Steps of Sealing the Heavens again to vanish.

"Interesting!" Hunji seemed intrigued, chasing Leng Qiuchan relentlessly.

Leng Qiuchan dodged repeatedly, their speeds reaching their peak. The group was amazed, even Luotian secretly marveled. Leng Qiuchan's years of training with Seven Steps of Sealing the Heavens surpassed his own, her speed matching his golden element energy.

But what surprised Luotian more was Hunji's speed—equally fast, matching Leng Qiuchan's Seven Steps of Sealing the Heavens.

After failing to catch Leng Qiuchan, Hunji's face finally showed impatience. He stood still.

"Ugh..." Leng Qiuchan exhaled, returning to the group's side. Her forehead was drenched in sweat from repeatedly using Seven Steps of Sealing the Heavens. She placed a pill into her mouth—Lo Tian's four-star elixir.

"Elixir?" Hunji frowned. The greatest drawback of this domain was the lack of spiritual energy, which is why his clan was so weak. Though he was currently powerful, he couldn't endure endless depletion.

"Enough playing! I said you can't escape! Soul-Binding Curse!" Hunji pointed, a black rune on his body writhing like a venomous snake. It flew toward them.

"Again!" The group's faces showed odd expressions. Hunji had used the same spiritual rune as the second elder.

Seeing Hunji use this technique again, they felt anger. They thought of how Lo Tian had wasted their spiritual stones and many treasures, and glared at him like a scornful wife.

Lo Tian felt the怨念-filled gazes around him and rubbed his nose, showing no embarrassment. He stepped forward, instantly appearing before Leng Qiuchan. His spiritual awareness formed a giant hand, seizing the spiritual rune about to bind Leng Qiuchan.

"Rest enough. It's time to stretch my bones!" Lo Tian smiled, glanced at Leng Qiuchan, and squeezed the spiritual rune, turning it into a storm of black mist.

Leng Qiuchan saw Lo Tian beside her. Her lips curled slightly beneath the veil, cold words escaping: "Thank you!"

"Everyone, rest a moment. I'll hold him off for a while," Lo Tian said without responding to Leng Qiuchan's words, fearing others would recognize their familiarity and cause unnecessary trouble for her. He turned to the group.

Seeing Lo Tian block his soul-binding curse, Hunji's face showed surprise. His lips curled: "I had planned to save you for last. Since you've come seeking death, I'll grant it!"

Chapter 228: All-Out Effort

"Then let's see if you have the ability!" Lo Tian smiled, his battle spirit surging. His feet cracked, spreading outward.

"Seeking death!" Hunji's face showed ferocity as he stepped forward, his fist filled with black energy smashing toward Lo Tian.

"Three Elements Clash, Light!" Lo Tian ran, whispering in his heart. Three elements clashed within his body.

Lo Tian radiated like the sun, illuminating the eighth level of the Locking Spirit Pagoda. The powerful light forced everyone to instinctively close their eyes.

Hunji was momentarily stunned, his aversion to light causing him to instinctively close his eyes.

This moment was enough for Lo Tian. Seizing the group's momentary blindness, he used Seven Steps of Sealing the Heavens to dodge Hunji's fist. Instantly, he appeared behind Hunji, his fist wrapped in six-colored spiritual energy smashing into Hunji's back.

"Stomp... stomp..." Hunji took a few unnatural steps forward, his face showing surprise. A streak of blood trickled from his lips.

Tuyuanzheng and Pang Haohan's faces showed surprise. They hadn't expected Lo Tian to be so strong, able to actually shake Hunji.

Remembering the group's combined attack had only wounded Hunji without damaging him fundamentally, Lo Tian's full-force strike had managed to make Hunji bleed.

"Ah..." Hunji, shaken by Lo Tian's attack, roared in anger. He vanished from sight, instantly appearing before Lo Tian. Black spiritual energy surged as he slammed his hand toward Lo Tian.

Lo Tian showed no fear, throwing another punch.

The collision caused both to retreat. However, Lo Tian was pushed against the wall before stopping his backward movement. Hunji, on the other hand, only took two steps back before charging toward Lo Tian again.

"Can he withstand a Mid-Bone Dissolution Stage attack? This Lo Tian is too monstrous!" Tuyuanzheng and Pang Haohan were stunned.

"Because he has already achieved Body-Refinement through his flesh!" Cold words came from Leng Qiuchan's mouth.

"Body... Refinement..." Tuyuanzheng repeated the words, trembling with disbelief.

Though they knew Lo Tian's body was strong, none had expected him to have achieved the legendary Body-Refinement through his flesh. In their minds, they had never seen such a Body Refinement Stage in the Northern or Southern Regions.

"Monstrous!" Their hearts felt a sense of awe, Lo Tian's monstrousness exceeding their imagination.

"Moreover, his spiritual energy strength is comparable to a Bone Dissolution Stage due to his strong physique!" Leng Qiuchan added, fueling their fire.

"Damn it!" Tuyuanzheng was the first to speak, cursing aloud.

"How can we live with this?" Pang Haohan's face showed bitterness. He could already imagine Lo Tian entering the Bone Dissolution Stage, crushing them all and becoming a legend in the Northern Region.

Chen Changsheng also felt admiration. When he had entered the state of unity with heaven in the Great An Forest, he could still suppress Lo Tian. Now, even if he entered the unity with heaven state, he wouldn't be Lo Tian's match. Lo Tian was undoubtedly the strongest in his stage.

While everyone felt bitter, Lo Tian and Hunji entered a fierce battle. They abandoned their martial arts, clashing with their bodies, neither willing to lose.

But Lo Tian felt bitter inside. He could sense his body was far weaker than Hunji's. He already felt his body on the verge of breaking.

Hunji was also secretly surprised. He knew his strength, having reached the so-called Mid-Bone Dissolution Stage. His mysterious runes also enhanced his body strength. Even with this, after so long without defeating Lo Tian, he felt annoyed.

However, seeing the cracks on Lo Tian's body, Hunji was confident that after another moment, he would crush this annoying little boy.

The collision caused them to separate again. Lo Tian's body was now trembling, as if about to collapse.

"I can't fight like this. I'll die for sure!" Lo Tian sighed internally. He was still weaker than Hunji.

Thinking this, Lo Tian decided to unleash his full power, activating his martial arts. His hands moved rapidly, spiritual energy droplets in his dantian boiling into thick spiritual energy, flowing into his hands.

"Again, martial arts!"

Hunji seemed annoyed by Lo Tian's actions. Knowing he was at a disadvantage in martial arts, he moved to interrupt Lo Tian's technique.

"End it all! Soul-Binding Curse!" As he ran, black runes on his body rotated continuously.

"Ten... a hundred..." Countless black spiritual snakes formed, spreading from Hunji as he ran.

"Five Elements Mutual Generation, King's Seal!" Without waiting for Hunji to approach, Lo Tian's seal flew out. At the same time, his body radiated an intense light.

Lo Tian unleashed all his secrets without holding back.

"Dead! This light is too effective against me!"

Hunji's body stopped again, cursing internally. However, he didn't care; Lo Tian had already used the King's Seal before, and he wasn't worried about his seal attack.

"Boom..." The seal smashed into Hunji's back again.

"Five Elements Mutual Generation! Golden Snake's Wild Dance!" The Cracking Heaven Spear roared again, forming a golden dragon toward Hunji.

"Trivial tricks! Useless against me!" Hunji sneered, throwing a punch. Black spiritual runes in his hand formed a black dragon to meet the golden snake.

"I said it was useless!" Hunji sneered, charging toward Lo Tian again.

"Twenty zhang... ten zhang..." The distance closed rapidly.

Seeing the approaching Hunji, Lo Tian's lips curled into a perfect arc. His cold voice echoed: "Soul-Stealing Seal!"

Chapter 229: Enter

"Buzz..." A spiritual awareness-formed seal formed in Lo Tian's hand.

As the transparent seal formed, a powerful pressure radiated from it. The black runes on Hunji's body scattered like mice seeing a cat, disintegrating into mist upon reaching Lo Tian.

Lo Tian pushed the Soul-Stealing Seal toward Hunji, who was approaching him. Their distance was only several zhang. Even if Hunji was extraordinary, he couldn't escape. The spiritual seal smashed into Hunji's head.

Hunji was a spiritual awareness master, naturally sensing the power of Lo Tian's seal. But he also knew that at this close distance, he couldn't escape.

He gritted his teeth, gathering the remaining spiritual awareness into a shield in front of himself.

"Boom..." An invisible wave spread. Though the group didn't know what happened, they felt Lo Tian's technique was definitely extraordinary. Seeing the black runes disintegrate before him, Lo Tian's martial arts were evident.

"Crack..." As if something had broken, a sound echoed in their ears.

Hunji felt the shield's rupture and knew it was bad. He wanted to dodge, but his speed couldn't match spiritual awareness.

A searing pain shot through Hunji's brain. Instinctively, he clutched his head and crouched. This was due to Hunji's strong spiritual awareness; otherwise, this single hit would have knocked out a regular Bone Dissolution Stage master.

"Hmph!" Lo Tian sneered, leaping ten zhang high. He waved his hand, revealing his final secret weapon.

"Sealing Soul Vessel!" Yes, all these attacks were preparing for Lo Tian to unleash the Sealing Soul Vessel. Though the Soul-Stealing Seal had wounded Hunji, Lo Tian knew it was only a wound. To truly defeat Hunji, he needed a stronger attack.

The Sealing Soul Vessel was Lo Tian's final secret weapon. Even someone with life-saving measures like Shangguan Hongtu had been wounded by it. He didn't believe Hunji could withstand it.

Lightning surrounded the Sealing Soul Vessel, appearing instantly above Lo Tian. It carried a pressure like a mountain.

The Sealing Soul Vessel appeared before Lo Tian, seemingly piercing through space. It landed on Hunji, who had just crouched.

Blood mist scattered. The last surviving member of the魂族 (Hun Clan) in Bone Dissolution Stage was turned into mist by the Sealing Soul Vessel.

This happened in an instant. Tuyuanzheng and others were still stunned by Lo Tian's Soul-Stealing Seal. In the next moment, Hunji, their seemingly formidable opponent, turned into mist.

"Is this Lo Tian's full power?" Tuyuanzheng and others looked at the ground where Lo Tian had landed, their faces filled with fear.

Lo Tian panted heavily. This Hunji was the strongest opponent he had faced. If it weren't for Hunji underestimating him and lacking martial arts, Lo Tian would have had to hide in the Sealing Soul Vessel waiting for others' rescue.

Lo Tian, upon landing, retrieved the Sealing Soul Vessel. A storage bag appeared at his feet. Without hesitation, he picked it up.

After this, Lo Tian walked toward Chen Changsheng and others. A bloodstained footprint formed under his feet, causing the group's hearts to tremble again.

Feeling their fearful gazes, Lo Tian smiled and said to Chen Changsheng: "Go to the ninth level!"

"Ah!" Chen Changsheng nodded, walking toward the ninth-level steps.

Seeing Chen Changsheng and others ascend the ninth-level steps, Tuyuanzheng and Pang Haohan's faces showed complex expressions. Lo Tian's strength had intimidated their minds and bodies, a powerful blow to their initial confidence.

Especially Tuyuanzheng, who had spent a fortune bringing Leng Qiuchan and her four companions to help him win this trial.

But they hadn't expected the most unassuming Lo Tian to become the key factor in their success. Thinking of Lo Tian's terrifying strength, they even felt a hint of retreat.

They knew they couldn't retreat. If they did, it would plant the seed of inferiority to Lo Tian in their hearts, affecting their future cultivation progress.

Others' faces also showed inner struggle, as if waiting for Tuyuanzheng and Pang Haohan's decision.

"Go!" Tuyuanzheng and Pang Haohan's eyes showed determination. They stepped onto the ninth-level steps.

As soon as they reached the ninth level, they saw Lo Tian and others standing outside the door. However, Chen Changsheng's figure had disappeared, obviously having entered the ninth level.

A light screen kept Lo Tian and others outside. It was clearly man-made. Who it was, Lo Tian could guess with his屁股 (ass). The sect's discovery of the domain wouldn't let others take the most important inheritance.

Seeing Tuyuanzheng's arrival, Lo Tian and others smiled. Remembering Chen Changsheng's words before entering, they laughed: "Tuyuanzheng, Pang Haohan. You two go in!"

"Hmph?" Hearing Lo Tian's words, Tuyuanzheng and Pang Haohan felt confused. At the same time, they secretly sighed in relief.

If Lo Tian had blocked them, they wouldn't have been able to do anything. Though Lo Tian now seemed injured and unstable, they knew his terrifying strength made them feel powerless.

But now hearing Lo Tian allow them to pass meant they still had a chance to compete.

"Thank you!" Tuyuanzheng and Pang Haohan bowed to Lo Tian.

"It was Chen Changsheng's request for you two to enter. He wants you to lose with your hearts convinced!" Lo Tian and Chai Xiangming's group said, their faces showing a hint of helplessness.

"I hope you compete fairly. If I find anyone teaming up, whoever obtains the inheritance will have to spit it out!" As Tuyuanzheng and Pang Haohan passed by Lo Tian, his voice entered their ears.

Tuyuanzheng and Pang Haohan's bodies trembled. Both showed a flicker of confidence, bowing to Lo Tian: "Rest assured, Lo Tian. We haven't reached the point of shame yet!"

After hearing their words, Lo Tian nodded slightly, signaling them to enter.

Chapter 230: Competing in the Locking Spirit Pagoda

"Alas... is this the last level? Finally, I can rest!" Chai Xiangming and others stood idly outside the ninth level, their faces relaxed.

"You stay here. I'll go for a walk!" Lo Tian also looked relaxed, thinking of the strange black gold chair in the second level and wanting to investigate it.

"Ah, that's fine. We'll stay here!" Chai Xiangming and others didn't stop him, obviously knowing the domain had nothing good left. The good things were likely in this ninth level, waiting for the three inside to emerge before sharing the rewards.

Lo Tian nodded slightly and walked down the stairs.

After passing through levels three to seven, Lo Tian found these five levels had no remarkable features. He wondered where the puppets had gone. Each level was empty.

Not long after, he reached the second level.

A pungent blood smell entered Lo Tian's nose. But soon, his eyes sharpened. His gaze fell on the black gold seat at the center—occupied by a person he recognized.

"Tuoba Ye! I had forgotten about him!" Lo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly.

At this moment, Tuoba Ye sat upright on the black gold seat, his eyes closed. A smile graced his face as if lost in pleasant thoughts. Even Lo Tian approaching him went unnoticed.

Curious, Lo Tian approached Tuoba Ye and felt his changes. He was puzzled about the black gold seat's purpose.

But soon, Lo Tian discovered what Tuoba Ye was doing. He extended his spiritual awareness and detected the first level, exclaiming: "It's clear now!"

As Lo Tian exclaimed, a cold aura appeared behind him. This aura was familiar to him—this was the speed-competent puppet from the fourth level that had repeatedly defeated him.

He activated Seven Steps of Sealing the Heavens, dodging the cold aura's first strike. Lo Tian was certain that if he hadn't evaded in time, he would have died at the puppet's hands. He could clearly sense the puppet's killing intent.

Not waiting to think, the puppet's attack came again.

Lo Tian quickly dodged. He guessed this puppet was controlled by Tuoba Ye to stop him.

The more he thought, the more he believed this possibility. His eyes flashed with coldness, his lips curling: "I defeated you once; I can do it again!"

He activated Seven Steps of Sealing the Heavens, charging toward the golden element puppet. With Seven Steps of Sealing the Heavens, he easily overpowered this previously defeated golden element puppet.

"Boom..." Within ten breaths, Lo Tian's fist smashed into the thin body of the golden element puppet. The thin puppet lost its ability to move again.

After this, Lo Tian's lips curled slightly as he looked at Tuoba Ye sitting on the black gold seat. His eyes flashed with coldness. The puppet had clearly shown him killing intent, so it must be controlled by Tuoba Ye.

Lo Tian's Cracking Heaven Spear appeared in his hand. He sighed softly: "Since you want to kill me, I have no reason to be polite. This black gold seat was originally my target; it doesn't belong to you!"

He thrust the spear forward, its splitting intent piercing Tuoba Ye's throat.

"Ugh..." Tuoba Ye opened his eyes, his face filled with shock. He hadn't expected anyone to come to the second level.

After recovering, Tuoba Ye had planned to explore other levels. However, he soon realized his elixirs were insufficient and returned to the second level out of boredom. He sat on this black gold seat, which shocked him.

As soon as he sat down, he felt the black gold seat's difference. His face showed joy because a sentence appeared in his mind: "Refining this Locking Spirit Seat grants the Locking Spirit Pagoda."

This was more than enough to make Tuoba Ye excited. He immediately started refining it. At that time, Lo Tian and others were clashing with Hunji, giving Tuoba Ye the perfect opportunity.

But as soon as he started refining, he felt how difficult it was. After refining for a while, he could only control the first level. This was due to his weak spiritual awareness. The Locking Spirit Pagoda was a grade-land treasure.

Time passed, and Tuoba Ye seemed disconnected from the outside world. He focused on refining it until he could feel the third level, discovering the wooden element puppet above it. Testing it, he found he could control this puppet.

But Tuoba Ye knew the third-level puppet was weak and couldn't help him. He didn't summon it to protect himself.

While refining, Tuoba Ye secretly prayed Lo Tian and others wouldn't descend. This was his only chance. If interrupted, it meant failure.

After much effort, Tuoba Ye refined to the fourth level. The fourth-level puppet was different from the third. Though its defense was weak, its speed and attack were beyond most people's ability to withstand. So Tuoba Ye summoned it to the second level, integrating it into the void to protect himself.

It coincidentally met Lo Tian descending. This led to what happened earlier. Tuoba Ye had considered being interrupted but hadn't expected anyone to dare kill him. After all, his sect was renowned in the Southern Region.

This made Tuoba Ye's death tragic. His command to the golden element puppet was to protect him at all costs.

But puppets were just puppets. In the puppet's view, killing the intruder was the only way to eliminate threats.

Tuoba Ye's misfortune was that he met Lo Tian, a killer. Anyone with intent to kill him would inevitably face his retaliation.

Lo Tian tossed Tuoba Ye aside, his face showing contemplation. He sat on the black gold seat but soon turned serious.

Lo Tian had experienced Tuoba Ye's situation. His eyes showed seriousness. He didn't know when Chen Changsheng and others would descend. If he started refining the Locking Spirit Seat now, how long would it take? If discovered, he'd be in danger. Tuoba Ye was the best example.

But the temptation of this Locking Spirit Pagoda, a grade-land treasure, was too great. Who wouldn't be tempted?

Lo Tian's face alternated between determination and hesitation. Finally, his eyes flashed with resolve: "Fortune favors the bold! Damn it! I'll take the risk!"

Chapter 231: Chen Changsheng's Victory

Lo Tian made his decision. He silently prayed not to be discovered while refining it, then closed his eyes again. His spiritual awareness began refining the Locking Spirit Seat.

Lo Tian's spiritual awareness was far stronger than Tuoba Ye's. His refinement speed was much faster, reaching the third level within an hour. He could sense the third-level aura.

What surprised him was that after defeating the golden element puppet, it returned to the third level. Lo Tian could clearly feel this golden element puppet repairing itself quickly.

Time was pressing, so he allocated a bit of spiritual awareness to check it before continuing his refinement.

"Hey? What is he doing?" Leng Qiuchan and her three companions appeared on the second level, walking toward Lo Tian.

Seeing them arrive, Lo Tian hadn't noticed. Leng Qiuchan's brows furrowed slightly as she approached the Locking Spirit Seat. Soon, she also discovered its special nature.

The black-cloaked man behind her suddenly widened his eyes, his face filled with shock. He stared at Lo Tian with naked greed.

"He's refining this seat, controlling the Locking Spirit Pagoda!" One of them exclaimed.

"Miss, should we?" A young man's eyes flashed with killing intent as he gripped a curved sword.

Leng Qiuchan naturally knew the Locking Spirit Pagoda was a precious treasure. But she looked at Lo Tian, her expression unchanged. She pulled back the black-cloaked man with a hand and shook her head lightly: "Forget it. He did save me before. This time, I'll return the favor!"
