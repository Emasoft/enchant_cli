As for Luo Su, Luo Tian had no time to care. What surprised Luo Tian was that Luo Su was already locked in a fierce battle with Diao Dezhu and Chen Zhanbiao.

Luo Tian also knew that whenever he took out the Dan Ding to practice, Luo Su would secretly watch. He said nothing about it. As his son, he naturally wouldn't hold back. Occasionally, he would demonstrate simple alchemical techniques for Luo Su to learn and ponder.

Those alchemists didn't leave either; they refused to depart, instead following Luo Tian daily to observe his practices.

Luo Tian didn't keep anything from them, handing over his practice notes to the alchemists. This was extremely precious for them, making them even more devoted. They knew Luo Tian did this to retain the five alchemists for Su Peng.

Su Peng was naturally delighted, as five alchemists were a great help to the Jiugui King City. Their presence could elevate the city's strength by another level.

Time passed slowly. Seven days had gone by, and that day, after accompanying Luo Dan, Luo Tian returned to the courtyard Su Peng had prepared for him.

"His condition is worsening!" Luo Tian's eyes showed anxiety; in the past two days, Luo Dan had been sleeping longer.

"Don't let you die!" Luo Tian whispered, having made some progress in the past seven days of practice. Now he needed to continuously refine and perfect it.

Luo Tian sat cross-legged on the ground, his five hearts facing heaven, hoping to reach his peak state.

But just as he sat down, Diao Dezhu's voice echoed in his ears.

"Your son was kidnapped by Luoshengmen!" Luo Tian suddenly opened his eyes, stood up, and a torrent of killing intent surged outward. Everyone in the Jiugui King City shivered.

As Luo Tian's killing intent rose, another stronger one followed, accompanied by a thunderous roar.

"Who dares harm my grandson!" Su Peng's despairing voice echoed through the city. In an instant, Su Peng surged into the sky above the Jiugui King City.

Though Su Peng had relinquished his position to Luo Dan, it was Su Peng who bore the burden of the city's affairs now.

With Luo Dan still in critical condition and Su Cheng having been severed by Fu Xingxuan, Su Peng had placed all his hopes on Luo Su. He believed Luo Su possessed the talent to inherit the Jiugui King City and elevate it. He knew Luo Su was capable.

Now, someone dared to kidnap his grandson—this was enough to kill him. Su Peng went mad.

The Jiugui King City erupted in chaos. Everyone gaped in shock, the first time they'd seen Su Peng so enraged. But when they realized it involved Luo Su, they understood; who didn't know Luo Su was Su Peng's beloved grandson?

"Uncle!" Luo Tian instantly soared into the sky, and Diao Dezhu's group appeared as well, their eyes filled with regret.

"What happened?" Luo Tian asked Diao Dezhu, who had been with Luo Su for days. He hadn't expected that being with them would still put Luo Su in danger.

"We had nothing to do but search for Luoshengmen in the Jiugui King City. Unexpectedly, they seemed to know we were looking for them and set up an ambush with a formation. They transferred me away, but Luo Su in the late stage of Tianxian was unaffected and was captured!" Diao Dezhu spoke.

"It's not your fault; these people are too mysterious. Even I couldn't detect them!" Su Peng sighed, understanding a little about the Shengu Wang lineage. He knew they had been lured out of the Shengu King City and destroyed, so if they were inside, they couldn't have dealt with them.

"They left a message: to save the boy, go to Tianhu Mountain beyond one hundred li from the Jiugui King City!" Diao Dezhu said, his gaze on Luo Tian.

"Let's go!" Su Peng roared without hesitation, ready to leap into any fire or mountain.

"But Uncle, I'll go!" Luo Tian stopped Su Peng. "Stay here."

Su Peng knew that the Shengu King had been lured out and destroyed, but with Luo Su's life at stake, he'd go even if it was a trap.

"I'll do something for him as his father!" Luo Tian shook his head gently.

"Uncle, let us go; the child was taken from our hands. This isn't over!" Diao Dezhu shouted, though he wasn't reliable, he had his head on big matters.

"Don't argue! Su Xiong stays behind; we'll go!" As they argued, a figure appeared in the sky—Xiang Tianming.

Chapter 2630: Do What I Can ()

Xiang Tianming had been in the Jiugui King City these days. As an Immortal King at the late stage, even the Jiugui King treated him with respect.

"Their target is you; therefore, you cannot go. Su Xiong, rest assured. I believe these people don't know I'm in the Jiugui King City; we have a great chance!" Xiang Tianming addressed Su Peng.

"Thanks to all of you!" Seeing Xiang Tianming's words, Su Peng nodded in agreement. With Xiang Tianming and Luo Tian's group, their strength far surpassed the Jiugui King City.

"Let's go!" Xiang Tianming soared into the sky, flying with Luo Tian and others toward Tianhu Mountain.

Tianhu Mountain was not far from the Jiugui King City, so the four arrived quickly.

A black mountain loomed before them. Ghostly qi surrounded it, emitting an eerie chill that obscured the view of its peak.

At the summit stood several figures, their eyes piercing through the mist to see Luo Tian's group.

"Who are you?" Behind the dark figures, a young one stood, his body wrapped in black ghostly qi. The youth struggled desperately but was powerless. His eyes held fear, staring at the black-cloaked men who trembled, his body shaking. He was only thirteen but had good talent; he hadn't faced great trials yet. The Jiugui King hadn’t let him train outside, and this was his first time being kidnapped. Their cold aura frightened him.

"Kid, stay quiet. Since your talent is good, if you behave well, there might be a chance to live. But your life depends on your grandfather!" One of the black-cloaked figures spoke, silencing Luo Su.

Though young, Luo Su wasn’t foolish; he understood these people wanted to use him to threaten his father Luo Tian and the Jiugui King.

"The Jiugui King didn’t come, but Luo Tian did!" One of the black-cloaked figures spoke, his eyes gleaming with amusement.

"Formation!" Diao Dezhu said at the mountain's edge, his gaze heavy. The Jiugui King’s strength was no joke; if they dared to wait for the Jiugui King, they must have made thorough preparations. According to their knowledge, Luoshengmen had never failed before.

"Let’s go up; no matter the danger, we must try!" Luo Tian said without letting Xiang Tianming fight. These people didn’t know about Xiang Tianming, their secret weapon. Luo Tian’s face was cold; his spear, Lie Tian, rested in his hand as he stepped toward the mountain. Upon entering the path, black mist obscured everything around them, a sense of crisis filled their minds, but it hadn’t erupted yet. If it did, it would be overwhelming—evidently, those on the mountain wanted them to ascend without stopping.

Through the forest, the four reached the summit and saw the five figures in Luoshengmen attire.

"Suo!" Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed; he ignored the five Luoshengmen and saw Luo Su behind them.

"Luo Tian, it seems this son means a lot to you!" One of the dark figures spoke. Through special methods, even Xiang Tianming couldn’t see their faces or hear their voices clearly.

"Luoshengmen, are you all so despicable? Cowards without faces!" Diao Dezhu mocked, his gaze on them while thinking if he could seize Luo Su in an instant.

But then Diao Dezhu sighed deeply; their qi locked onto Luo Su tightly, leaving no chance. If he moved, they had an 80% chance of killing Luo Su.

"Speak up; what do you want? Make your demands!" Luo Tian looked at Diao Dezhu. His speed was fast, but slightly slower than Diao Dezhu’s.

They were in a passive position now; Luo Su was in their hands, and they had come because they cared about his life. If these people controlled Luo Su, they held them in their grasp.

Luo Tian’s eyes widened, emitting two beams of golden light like the sun, staring at those figures.

"If you dare look at us, I’ll rip out your son’s eyes!" But as Luo Tian activated his Golden Wheel Thunder Yang Eye, a cold voice echoed in his ears.

They were five people; the one in the center was their leader.

"Luo Tian, you have two choices: one is to trade your life for your son’s; the second is to join Luoshengmen!" The leader spoke.

"Daydreaming!" Luo Tian coldly replied, his gaze on the leader. Among them was one Immortal King mid-stage and four at early stage. If they fought, they could definitely destroy them, but the problem was Luo Su.

"Daydreaming; who’s living in a dream?" The leader spoke, grabbing Luo Su's leg and squeezing it.

Crack...

The sound of breaking echoed on Luo Su’s leg, and he let out a painful cry.

"Now reconsider?" The leader spoke, his gaze cold toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian clenched his fists tightly, gazing at the five Luoshengmen warriors, watching Luo Su’s painful expression.

"Fine!"

"I join Luoshengmen!" Luo Tian gritted out the words from his teeth, making Diao Dezhu and others’ faces slightly change.

Luo Tian’s character was known to them; he rarely compromised, but now he had done so without hesitation.

"That’s wise. Why let your son suffer? Come over now!" The leader spoke, raising his hand and summoning a black statue that appeared before them.

The black statue radiated endless authority, depicting a middle-aged man with six pairs of black wings on his back. He had black feet on his head and six arms, each holding a hand seal.

Luo Tian had no choice but to step forward toward the five, his gaze on Luo Su.

Luo Su’s forehead was constantly sweating, in pain almost crying, his gaze on Luo Tian.

Though he had never met Luo Tian before, he had heard from Su Dan that his father was a man of great stature. He resented Luo Tian for abandoning them, but blood was thicker than water; he still acknowledged Luo Tian as his father.

"Stay strong, dad is coming to save you!"

"Dad isn’t capable of saving you, but trading one life for another is possible!" Luo Tian gazed at Luo Su, his face softening. His voice reached Luo Su’s ears, seemingly lessening his pain.

Chapter 2631: Six-Armed Divine Emperor ()

"Speak, how to proceed?" Luo Tian addressed the five. Now he was ready to risk everything; at worst, he would lose his life, but he had to save Luo Su.

"Kneel and drip a drop of blood onto the statue, swearing eternal loyalty to Luoshengmen!" The leader spoke.

"Kneeling is impossible; I, Luo Tian, have never knelt to heaven or earth, only to those who deserve it!" Luo Tian coldly replied.

"Crack..." But the answer was another crack from Luo Su’s other leg, but this time he didn’t speak; his face was pale as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"Good, good! I’ll kneel!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, gazing at Luo Su, kneeling before the black statue. He then pointed his finger, a drop of red blood fell onto it.

Wum...

As Luo Tian’s blood fell, the statue's six hand seals emitted waves. Six crimson hand seals instantly flew out toward Luo Tian.

"Don’t resist!" Seeing the six red hand seals, their bodies were excited; they could see excitement in their eyes.

Luo Tian’s name was well-known in Luoshengmen, a target they had to capture. If they subdued Luo Tian, it would be a major achievement.

"Rest easy; I said I wouldn’t resist. Now can you release my son?" Luo Tian let the six red hand seals imprint on his body.

"Stay back!" At the same time, Luo Tian roared, waving his hand to stop Diao Dezhu and Chen Zhanbiao.

"Of course, release him!" The five black-cloaked people raised their hands, lifting Luo Su and tossing him to Diao Dezhu’s group.

Diao Dezhu showed surprise, quickly catching Luo Su. He hadn’t expected them to return him.

After checking Luo Su’s injuries, they found only his leg broken and no serious harm. Diao Dezhu then used the power of heaven and earth to instantly heal Luo Su’s wounds.

Then, they turned their gaze back to Luo Tian, eyes filled with concern. These people had returned Luo Su so easily; they must have been confident that nothing would happen to Luo Tian.

"Don’t be afraid; the initial pain will pass, and then you’ll be one of us. Perhaps even our leader!" The leader gazed at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian stood up, his eyes also serious; the six hand seals had landed on six points of his body: arms, legs, head, and dantian.

Luo Tian felt an irresistible force pinning his limbs, making him unable to move. The hand seal in his dantian caused his face to change drastically.

A wave of gray mist spread from the hand seal in Luo Tian’s dantian, spreading through his body and sealing his dantian.

Meanwhile, the other five hand seals also spread gray mist, spreading throughout Luo Tian’s body, seemingly merging with the other points.

"What power is this!" Luo Tian was shocked; this force had instantly suppressed his Immortal King strength.

"Six Realms of Rebirth!" Luo Tian realized, knowing this power was no easy task; otherwise, they wouldn’t have returned Luo Su to him after imprinting the hand seal.

Six Realms of Rebirth power rose in Luo Tian’s dantian, continuously attacking the hand seal.

"Ah..." As the Six Realms of Rebirth power surged, a wave of extreme pain spread through Luo Tian’s body.

Luo Tian's face twisted instantly, his head drenched in sweat.

"Luo Tian!"

"Big brother!" Diao Dezhu and the others rushed to Luo Tian’s side, eyes full of worry but dared not act rashly.

"Ren Hongzhe, take Su away first!" Luo Tian addressed Ren Hongzhe, still thinking of ensuring Luo Su’s safety.

"I’m not leaving!" Luo Su shouted, gazing at Luo Tian’s painful expression with determination.

As they spoke, the terrifying power had begun to connect in some places. Luo Tian felt his meridians no longer obeying him, and even part of his soul had changed.

"What’s going on!" Luo Tian was shocked to the core; he had never encountered this before.

"Great Six-Armed Divine Emperor, please return!" The five figures knelt before the statue, pressing complex hand seals onto it.

"Kill them!" Luo Tian roared, sensing something bad would happen. Though killing these people might not help much.

"You dare? If we die, he’ll be buried with us!" The leader sneered at Xiang Tianming.

And just as the words were spoken, a powerful pressure radiated from Luo Tian’s body, subduing everything around. Even Xiang Tianming felt a crisis.

"What's happening? What’s going on!" Diao Dezhu and the others were completely panicked, though they had expected it. They still felt Luo Tian faced a great crisis.

"Don’t move; watch!" Xiang Tianming, having experienced much, made his decision.

The black statue emitted another wave of energy; Luo Tian’s body seemed to be sucked in, absorbing the statue's power.

A killing intent struck Luo Tian’s mind, making his face change drastically.

"Seizure! This is a soul seizure!" Luo Tian finally understood; this was a soul trying to seize his body.

And this soul’s strength was no less than his own, perhaps even surpassing it. The six hand seals were the best proof; if anyone else had been in his place, they would have been seized.

"But I still have one move left!" Luo Tian muttered to himself, beginning to gather his soul that wasn’t controlled toward a single point.

As Luo Tian’s soul converged, the power accelerated rapidly, quickly taking over his body.

Luo Tian's entire body exuded a supreme pressure; his eyes gradually turned gray.

"I’ve finally awakened!" Luo Tian whispered, voice cold, gazing at Diao Dezhu and others with a ruthless gaze.

"Six-Armed Divine Emperor, is he an emperor?" Xiang Tianming and others gazed in disbelief, sensing the pressure from Luo Tian’s body. Even he felt a chill.

"Has Luo Tian been seized?" Ren Hongzhe exclaimed, eyes full of shock.

"Another ancient power has awakened; it's the eighth!" The five Luoshengmen warriors gazed with excitement.

"This body, I like it; but this soul is too weak!" Luo Tian spoke softly, feeling the strength and vitality of this body.

Chapter 2632: Half-Step Immortal Emperor ()

On the peak of Tianhu Mountain, several figures stood there, their gazes all on Luo Tian. It was more like the Six-Armed Divine Emperor because his aura had completely changed, making him appear colder and more authoritative.

"Has the seizure succeeded?" The five Luoshengmen warriors bowed to Luo Tian, faces full of respect.

"Why did you awaken me?" Luo Tian asked the five Luoshengmen warriors, not even glancing at Xiang Tianming and others.

"Master, eight strong ones have already awakened before you. Because the catastrophe is approaching, Luoshengmen rises; master, lead us to long life!" The five warriors shouted.

"Luoshengmen kidnapped the ten saint sons to seize ancient powers!" Xiang Tianming exclaimed.

"Are these people all emperors?" Diao Dezhu also gasped, sensing Luoshengmen's grand plans and their terrifying strength.

"Each ancient emperor was a power that could traverse the cosmos; if they all awaken, neither heaven nor hell would be able to resist Luoshengmen!" Xiang Tianming’s eyes were serious.

"We Luoshengmen have sealed twelve half-step emperor souls! The Six-Armed Divine Emperor was once a half-step emperor!" The five Luoshengmen warriors gazed with pride at Xiang Tianming and others.

"What do you mean, two choices? Either join us Luoshengmen or wait until our twelve half-step emperors awaken. Then we’ll rule the world; who can stop us!"

"You definitely won’t be like Luo Tian, seized by them. Your bodies won’t be considered!" The leader continued, believing no one would refuse; after all, long life was the goal of many.

"Twelve half-step emperors!" Xiang Tianming and others were shocked; though a half-step emperor was vastly different from a true emperor, in this era, there were no half-step emperors. Even the peak Immortal King dominated a region.

"This is discrimination, blatant discrimination! Why is this kid so valuable? They don’t even look at our bodies. I spit!" Diao Dezhu cursed, making the five Luoshengmen warriors slightly stunned; they hadn’t expected this to be his focus.

Crack...

As they spoke, the Six-Armed Divine Emperor moved his body slightly and clenched his fists.

"Since you chose to awaken us in this era, it must be just right!" The Six-Armed Divine Emperor spoke a few words that Xiang Tianming and others couldn’t understand, gazing at them.

"Submit or die!" A cold voice echoed from Luo Tian’s mouth, though his cultivation was still Immortal King mid-stage. The indomitable authority made Xiang Tianming and others feel a powerful pressure.

"You’re not at your peak yet; what qualifications do you have to subdue me!"

"Ren Hongzhe, take Luo Su away first. I want to see what this Six-Armed Divine Emperor can do!"

"Zhanbiao, Diao Dezhu, you two eliminate them!" Xiang Tianming quickly assigned tasks to the group and soared into the air, facing "Luo Tian."

"Immortal King late stage; back then, I could have killed you with one hand!" Luo Tian raised his hand and slammed a black hand down, radiating immense divine power that struck Xiang Tianming.

Xiang Tianming sneered and raised his hand, countering with a blue hand.

Boom...

The battle erupted instantly; Diao Dezhu and Chen Zhanbiao also soared into the air, rushing toward the five Luoshengmen warriors.

Though they were five people, Diao Dezhu and Chen Zhanbiao weren’t intimidated. Diao Dezhu directly targeted the Immortal King mid-stage, while Chen Zhanbiao rushed toward the four Immortal King early stages.

Step by step...

The void trembled; Xiang Tianming and Luo Tian both retreated, Luo Tian’s face finally showing seriousness.

"Truly strong; you’ll be my steed!" The Six-Armed Divine Emperor smiled, still not looking at Xiang Tianming.

"Now I’m weak, but defeating you isn’t that hard!" The Six-Armed Divine Emperor spoke and quickly changed his hands, dark divine laws swirling around Luo Tian, forming four arms. Each arm rapidly shifted.

Six martial arts instantly struck; each contained immense power, making Xiang Tianming’s face change.

"Roar..." Xiang Tianming roared, his body expanding rapidly and transforming into a massive form. He opened his mouth, creating a whirlpool that shot out a blue water column to clash with the six martial arts.

Boom... Boom... Boom...

The thunderous sound was overwhelming; water splashed, waves shattered, and the martial arts were destroyed by Xiang Tianming’s attack.

However, though Xiang Tianming's attack was powerful, the Six-Armed Divine Emperor had unleashed six martial arts. Xiang Tianming blocked four but two struck his massive body.

"Kunpeng... good, but this isn’t water; the conditions here restrict your strength!" The Six-Armed Divine Emperor sneered.

"Is that so?" But as the Six-Armed Divine Emperor prepared to launch another attack, a cold voice suddenly echoed in his mind, making him shudder.

"This body isn’t yours!" Before the Six-Armed Divine Emperor could finish speaking, a strong fluctuation began to spread from Luo Tian’s body—Luo Tian's true soul was潜伏 inside.

In an instant, a gray soul knife凝聚 and precisely cut the Six-Armed Divine Emperor’s soul.

A piercing scream echoed in the sky, and Luo Tian's body fell from the sky, crashing onto the mountain peak. He seemed frozen there, motionless.

"Luo Tian!" Xiang Tianming was so experienced he noticed the change in Luo Tian, his eyes filled with joy.

"Temporarily don’t worry about Luo Tian; first eliminate these five!" Xiang Tianming didn’t pay attention to the motionless Luo Tian but spread his wings, creating a chaotic storm that rushed toward the five Luoshengmen warriors fighting with Diao Dezhu and Chen Zhanbiao.

"Damn it, Luo Tian’s soul isn’t dead!" The five Luoshengmen warriors showed disbelief; they had seen half-step emperor souls seize before, but this was the first time one failed. Half-step emperors’ souls were powerful; this statue sealed a half-step emperor’s soul fragment. They used these statues to find suitable targets for seizure; once seized, other souls would gather here and merge to complete the seizure.

Chapter 2633: Repel ()

On Tianhu Mountain, Diao Dezhu and Chen Zhanbiao fought five people with two against four. Chen Zhanbiao alone faced four Immortal King early stages, his strong body crushing them with each punch. Each strike made one of them spit blood.

Meanwhile, the other three attacks hit Chen Zhanbiao but left no damage; they only created thunderous sounds, leaving the four in despair. This battle was impossible to fight.

Diao Dezhu’s situation was simpler; his speed seemed to reach its limit, leaving the Immortal King mid-stage with no choice but to be hit.

As the five struggled, Xiang Tianming charged toward them with fury, a chaotic storm sweeping over.

"Damn it!" The five warriors cursed; they hadn’t expected this turn of events. If Xiang Tianming attacked, they would surely die.

"Use the formation!" The leader shouted, his hands flashing with divine light. He raised a gray axe and swung it at the chaotic storm while holding a gray command flag with his other hand.

The other four also acted, each holding a formation flag and waving them.

Buzz... Buzz... Buzz...

As the five waved their flags, waves of fluctuation rose from ten thousand li around Tianhu Mountain. The formation wasn’t just set up around the mountain but further away.

The momentum of heaven and earth rapidly gathered at Tianhu Mountain’s peak, a powerful pressure pressing down. Instantly, Diao Dezhu, Chen Zhanbiao, and even Xiang Tianming felt their bodies heavy as if the sky pressed down. That aura exceeded the Immortal King realm.

As this pressure gathered, Tianhu Mountain’s surroundings, ten thousand li around it, instantly became desolate. Xiang Tianming and others could clearly see the life of people or plants around Tianhu Mountain was drained by the formation’s power to suppress them.

"Desolation power, heavenly power! Xiang Tianming's eyes showed seriousness; he raised his hand and created a blue barrier, enclosing Diao Dezhu and Chen Zhanbiao. He used his domain to counter this pressure.

The five Luoshengmen warriors held their formation flags, continuously directing the waves of desolation power to attack Xiang Tianming and others.

The scene gradually calmed; Xiang Tianming was an Immortal King late stage, and the five Luoshengmen warriors hadn’t expected this. But they had prepared thoroughly.

"What good is an Immortal King late stage? Watch us crush you!" The leader shouted, waving his command flag confidently.

While Xiang Tianming and others fought, Luo Tian also faced a strong enemy in his mind. A gray soul stood there, gazing at the opposing soul.

"This body’s owner? I was confused; this body is so strong, but the soul is weak. It only resisted a little and was seized successfully!" The gray soul spoke, his eyes showing seriousness toward Luo Tian.

The Six-Armed Divine Emperor had roamed the ancient times, powerful beyond measure; this was his first time sensing a threat from an Immortal King soul.

"Kill!" Luo Tian didn’t bother to talk, his gray spear striking toward the Six-Armed Divine Emperor.

The "Breaking Void" spear technique was executed instantly, piercing the Six-Armed Divine Emperor’s front. The divine emperor's face changed; he could clearly feel the absolute pressure from Luo Tian’s body.

"Damn it!"

"Who are you?" The Six-Armed Divine Emperor gasped, this pressure even making him feel panic. It was purely a soul instinct; he hadn’t felt such a feeling from the true emperors of Luoshengmen before.

"But your soul is too weak; I’ve also weakened it, but it’s enough to deal with you!" The Six-Armed Divine Emperor roared, his soul power forming six arms and hand seals to strike Luo Tian.

"Weakened? You’re injured, aren’t you?" The two fought continuously while exchanging words.

Boom... Boom... Boom...

In an instant, the gray "Breaking Void" spear pierced through the six martial arts, the gray soul power swirling. The "Breaking Void" spear remained strong and pierced through the six martial arts, appearing before the Six-Armed Divine Emperor.

The Six-Armed Divine Emperor remained calm, his powerful soul forming six weapons in his hands. He launched them all at Luo Tian.

The collision sounds kept coming; this time, Luo Tian was pushed back, and the Six-Armed Divine Emperor briefly took the upper hand.

Time passed slowly; two souls fought for life, each using their full strength but unable to defeat the other. Both felt their soul power decreasing.

"Are you getting impatient?" But Luo Tian could feel the Six-Armed Divine Emperor's impatience, his heart mocking.

The Six-Armed Divine Emperor was seizing; this body wasn’t originally his but Luo Tian’s. Luo Tian had the home advantage.

But the Six-Armed Divine Emperor was indeed powerful, making Luo Tian shocked. He was a soul master and had just attacked the Six-Armed Divine Emperor, but the divine emperor still fought him evenly.

"Kid, take good care of this body; I’ll come back!" The Six-Armed Divine Emperor sneered, beginning to leave. He knew if he continued, it would be disadvantageous for him.

"Want to run?" Luo Tian muttered in his heart, determined not to let the Six-Armed Divine Emperor escape. If he allowed it, future trouble would follow.

"I want to run; you can’t stop me!" The Six-Armed Divine Emperor’s eyes showed contempt, his soul rising and heading toward Luo Tian's body.

"This kid’s soul is absolutely invincible! If he develops further, his soul cultivation will be no less than the first!" The Six-Armed Divine Emperor muttered, enduring Luo Tian’s spear and flying toward the black statue.

"Run already!" After fighting for half an hour, Luo Tian muttered in his heart; his condition wasn’t good and needed rest. He thought he’d deal with the current problem first.

Wum...

A fluctuation spread from Luo Tian’s body, and the gray soul appeared. Upon appearing, the Six-Armed Divine Emperor turned into a gray light and flew toward the black statue.

"Six-Armed Divine Emperor, how is this possible!" The five Luoshengmen warriors showed disbelief; they hadn’t expected the Six-Armed Divine Emperor to lose.

"Retreat!" The leader spoke, knowing continuing would be no good for them.

The five soared into the sky, grabbed the statue, and flew away.

"Where are you going!" Chen Zhanbiao roared, ready to chase them but a voice echoed in their ears.

Chapter 2634: Soul-Subduing Pills ()

"Don’t chase!" A tired voice echoed in their ears. Luo Tian stood behind them, gazing at Diao Dezhu and others.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the three returned to his side, resisting the formation but allowing them to leave.

"I’m fine; my soul power was greatly consumed, but it’s nothing!" Luo Tian replied. As the five left, the formation attacking them gradually weakened and was shattered by Xiang Tianming.

Kunpeng spread his wings, and Xiang Tianming directly let Luo Tian and the others stand on his massive body, flying toward the Jiugui King City.

At that moment, Su Peng, Luo Su, and Ren Hongzhe stood there; behind them sat Su Dan, her eyes filled with anxiety.

"Why haven’t they returned yet?" Su Dan spoke, leaning on the table and weakly addressing them.

A black cloud appeared, a massive body blocking their view. It appeared in the sky above the Jiugui King City, making Su Peng’s face change drastically.

"Don’t fear; they’ve returned!" Ren Hongzhe smiled, watching the five people land on the ground and sighing deeply.

"Dad!" Luo Su ran to Luo Tian’s side, gazing at his pale face with excitement.

Hearing "Dad" from Luo Su, Luo Tian’s body trembled; his eyes showed joy as he looked at Luo Su. His lips slightly curled, this was the first time Luo Su called him "Dad."

"Good child! Everything is fine!" Luo Tian patted Luo Su’s shoulder, supporting him as they approached Su Peng and Su Dan.
