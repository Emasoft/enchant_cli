"Where exactly is this?" Luo Tian's mind was filled with confusion. The Spirit Ghost Marsh felt extremely strange; it was thick with ghostly mist, yet there were no ghosts. As time passed, the pressure grew stronger, and Luo Tian and Mo Tian's speed slowed. Their feet were now submerged in the marsh, with no visible horizon—there was no sense of direction.

"We're lost!" Mo Tian's face darkened. The place looked the same everywhere, making it easy to get lost.

Luo Tian's expression was equally grim. He couldn't find any other place either; even his spiritual awareness couldn't penetrate far.

"What do we do? We can't die here, not even crossing the marsh!" Mo Tian let out a bitter laugh.

"Domain!" Luo Tian muttered under his breath, and the Wheel of Rebirth Domain unfolded, enveloping him.

"Judging by the pressure, just head toward where it's strongest—it'll be deeper!" Luo Tian spoke softly. If a True Immortal encountered this situation, it would be extremely dangerous; however, since both were Immortal Kings with Domains, they could sense every movement within their domains.

"Right!" Mo Tian's eyes brightened. This method was the simplest and most practical.

A silver Domain appeared before Mo Tian, and together they carefully sensed the pressure changes. They began moving toward the depths of the Spirit Ghost Marsh.

Ten thousand zhang... one hundred li...

They advanced another hundred li, but the pressure was already overwhelming. Fortunately, both had prior experience navigating the Spirit Ghost Marsh, especially the map left by Black and White Yan, which guided Luo Tian to the correct path.

"Damn it, why is this pressure so intense?" Mo Tian's face darkened. Sweat dripped from his forehead, falling into the marsh below.

"Only a short time has passed. We've barely entered a thousand li, yet the pressure is already this strong. What if we go deeper?" Mo Tian addressed Luo Tian, realizing the Spirit Ghost Marsh was far more challenging than they'd imagined.

"For now, let's just keep going," Luo Tian said without further explanation. He too felt the pressure increasing.

Ten li... one hundred li...

They traveled three hundred li, but Mo Tian could no longer endure. His Domain shattered with a crash, and his body trembled as the immense pressure pinned him down, sending him plummeting into the marsh. Without the five hundred zhang range and his Domain, Mo Tian felt as if he carried mountains on his back, crushed into the Spirit Ghost Marsh.

"Done for!" Mo Tian's heart cried out. He hadn't expected to die so shamefully, falling into the marsh.

"Buzz..." Just as Mo Tian fell, a roar echoed from above. A black vortex churned the mist, and a black ghostly claw shot out, seizing Mo Tian.

"Pull him up!" Luo Tian barked, commanding the black ghostly claw to drag Mo Tian back. At the same time, Luo Tian felt Mo Tian's pressure was twice his own.

"This is only a hundred zhang down. If we go further, who could return?" Luo Tian mused.

"Roar..." As Luo Tian pulled Mo Tian up, another roar erupted from the mist beneath them. Both men's faces turned grave.

Chapter 2535: Crocodile

"What is that?" Luo Tian and Mo Tian's minds jolted. The roar wasn't just one—it was a series of roars.

"It's a crocodile!" Mo Tian's eyes flashed silver, gazing downward as he spoke to Luo Tian, his expression filled with horror.

"Not just one. Countless!" Mo Tian shivered, activating his Moon Eclipse Eyes to see through the marsh.

Numerous crocodiles slithered through the marsh, opening their mouths wide to gaze at Luo Tian and Mo Tian above.

"Boom..." A crocodile several zhang long broke through the mire, charging toward Luo Tian and Mo Tian. A row of icy teeth glinted with cold light, opening wide to appear before the two.

"Die!" Mo Tian struck with a palm, his black hand slamming onto the crocodile's massive body. The beast was crushed into meaty pulp, falling from the sky.

Plop... plop...

The meaty pulp was swiftly devoured by the marsh's crocodiles, their cold eyes still fixated on Luo Tian and Mo Tian. More crocodiles soared up, attacking the two.

"Let's go!" Though they killed these crocodiles like slaughtering chickens, Luo Tian and Mo Tian didn't want to waste time. They expanded their Domains against the immense pressure, pushing deeper into the Spirit Ghost Marsh.

The crocodiles refused to let them go. The two had apparently disturbed the marsh's ruler, as layers of crocodiles emerged from the mire, filling it entirely. Among them was a sinister aura that made Luo Tian and Mo Tian feel threatened.

"My heavens!" The two men trembled, staring at the endless crocodiles. Their scalps prickled.

Finally, the crocodiles began attacking Luo Tian and Mo Tian repeatedly. Their speed was astonishing, constantly colliding with the two's Domains.

Boom... boom...

All were suicidal attacks. Each crocodile exploded before their Domains, instantly turning them blood-red. The entire marsh became chaotic as the crocodiles attacked relentlessly, slowing the two's progress.

"Who is it? So strong to dare provoke these things!" As Luo Tian and Mo Tian slowly advanced, four figures appeared at the marsh's edge.

The four concealed their forms, with a compass hovering above them, emitting divine laws to envelop them.

These four were Diao Dezhu and others who had infiltrated Hell. After searching for days, they'd found the Spirit Ghost Marsh using Diao Dezhu's nose and Zhang Chenglong's experience.

"The Rebirth Grass is moving!" Diao Dezhu sniffed, observing the agitated crocodiles within the marsh.

"It must be on the person being chased. We can let these crocodiles injure him, then take advantage of the situation!" Sun Kelnian's eyes gleamed with excitement, immediately thinking of a plan.

"Can't afford to anger Sun Kelnian. That old man has too many tricks!" Diao Dezhu thought, having known Sun Kelnian for years.

After Sun Kelnian spoke, his hands moved swiftly. Invisible waves radiated from his palms. Simultaneously, Si Ma Tuo extended his hand, releasing a cloud of gray powder that soared with Sun Kelnian's divine laws, swirling in the air.

"Roar..." The crocodiles inhaled the gray powder, roaring with red eyes. A wild aura spread, and some crocodiles that had stopped chasing Luo Tian and Mo Tian now turned back to attack them.

"Is it too harsh? Won't he die?" Diao Dezhu muttered, feeling pity for the person ahead.

"Relax. This place is surrounded by water. We observed it before—this is a Supreme Domain, definitely a cursed place. We don't know where we are, but the person ahead must. Who dares come here without skill?" Zhang Chenglong said lazily, his eyes filled with excitement. As the elder of Sun Kelnian and Si Ma Tuo, he was also an Immortal King in the middle stage. In stealing and tomb raiding, Zhang Chenglong was definitely an authority.

A cursed place must have treasures!

Sun Kelnian and Si Ma Tuo's faces glowed with excitement. Diao Dezhu was the same—these men were greedy, unable to resist good things.

"Let's go. With the person ahead drawing attention, we've got it easy!" The four stepped on the water, heading deeper into the Spirit Ghost Marsh. Compared to Luo Tian and Mo Tian, they found it much easier.

"Damn it, why are these crocodiles crazy?" Mo Tian shouted, continuously killing the crocodiles. His Domain was already cracking, with many crocodiles breaking through to charge at Luo Tian and Mo Tian fearlessly.

"These crocodiles have changed. Though they were wild before, they still had reason. Now, they don't fear death at all!" Luo Tian's face darkened. Their progress was like a snail; escaping this two-thousand-li marsh was pure fantasy.

"Going higher doesn't help. Going lower doesn't either!" Mo Tian's face darkened, feeling his luck had hit rock bottom.

The two were now killing mindlessly, having exterminated countless crocodiles. Yet still, endless numbers charged at them.

"Someone tampered with this!" Luo Tian shouted, startling Mo Tian.

"We can't keep going like this. We'll be worn down eventually!" Mo Tian roared, his eyes merging into one, blood trickling from the corners of his eyes.

"Buzz..." Invisible waves swept outward. Any crocodile caught in the waves froze mid-air, falling from the sky.

"Beast Control Seal!" Taking advantage of the moment, Luo Tian formed a hand seal. A green Beast Control Seal appeared above his head. He continuously cast divine laws, the green light swirling into symbols that entered the crocodiles' bodies.

As the Beast Control Seal took control, the red in the crocodiles' eyes gradually faded. Half green, half red.

"Whew..." Luo Tian and Mo Tian sighed deeply. Mo Tian's eyes remained closed, clearly exhausted from casting the illusion on so many crocodiles.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian grabbed Mo Tian, pressing deeper. The crocodiles began attacking those that followed.

"Don't let me find out who it is! If I do, I'll kill you!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly. He was also terrified—this marsh had others who could control crocodiles.

Luo Tian led Mo Tian through the treacherous path. The pressure grew stronger, even for Luo Tian. His qi surged violently as he guided Mo Tian forward, his powerful spiritual awareness covering a hundred zhang. He dared not be careless.

"Indeed, they have skill!" Just as Luo Tian and Mo Tian left, Zhang Chenglong and the others arrived at the battlefield between the two crocodile groups. Yet the crocodiles seemed to ignore them, continuing their battle.

The four didn't linger; Diao Dezhu sensed they were getting closer to the person with Rebirth Grass.

"Be careful. The opponent isn't a pushover. Use strategy if possible; if not, check their strength. They're in the open, we're in the shadows!" Zhang Chenglong spoke, his compass above him as he pursued Luo Tian and Mo Tian.

Without the crocodiles chasing them, their speed improved slightly. Still, compared to normal, it was slow—due to the immense pressure.

Luo Tian summoned a blood-red long sword, which hovered above his head. This eased their pressure slightly.

"We're only three hundred li away! Let's just push through, even if it costs us!" Mo Tian said, his eyes now recovered.

"Right. I don't know why, but I feel like we're being watched," Luo Tian nodded, his qi surging violently. His body emitted a roaring aura.

"Let's go!" The two rushed forward, burning a drop of essence blood to maximize their speed toward the marsh's edge.

Ten li... one hundred li...

An hour later, Luo Tian and Mo Tian were only ten thousand zhang away from the marsh's edge. The black mist had also thinned.

"I can see the other side!" Mo Tian's face lit up with excitement, his eyes glowing with divine light as he shouted.

"Roar..." But just as Mo Tian's voice faded, a thunderous roar echoed from the marsh. "Boom..."

Mud surged upward as an immense body appeared before Luo Tian and Mo Tian, moving at lightning speed. A blood-red maw lunged toward them.

A hundred-zhang-long crocodile broke through the marsh, its stench making Luo Tian and Mo Tian dizzy.

"Supreme Domain!" Both men gasped. They hadn't expected such a creature at the edge.

They couldn't let it bite them; even with their formidable bodies, an Immortal King in the middle stage would be crushed by its bite.

Luo Tian and Mo Tian instantly felt the danger, their bodies vanishing from sight.

"Crack..." The sky trembled as the blood-red maw closed, cracks forming around it. Luo Tian and Mo Tian's mouths twitched; they knew if bitten, they wouldn't survive.

"Boom..." The mud surged upward as the massive crocodile fell back into the marsh. Its fierce aura vanished.

"Be careful!" Luo Tian and Mo Tian stood back-to-back, cautiously watching the marsh. Their spiritual awareness couldn't locate the crocodile's position—it seemed to have vanished.

Mo Tian's eyes flashed with light again, scanning the marsh. He suddenly gasped: "It's coming again!"

Chapter 2536: Breaking Free from the Marsh

"Boom..." The massive body burst through the marsh, moving with no clumsiness. Its speed was astonishing as it charged toward Luo Tian and Mo Tian. Mo Tian couldn't match its pace.

The blood-red maw instantly engulfed Luo Tian and Mo Tian, spewing a green mist from its mouth.

"It's poison!" Luo Tian's expression darkened. His hands moved swiftly, the flame mark on his forehead flashing. A torrent of ten-color flames erupted, sweeping toward the poison.

"Hiss..." The two opposing forces clashed repeatedly, emitting white smoke. Yet the maw still closed in on Luo Tian and Mo Tian, causing their faces to change.

"Can't dodge!" Both men felt the danger immediately, staring at the closing maw.

"Then we'll have to endure!" Luo Tian's face darkened. His blood-red sword erupted with overwhelming power, slashing toward the maw.

"Domain!" Mo Tian also opened his Domain. Ghostly qi surged, forming a black coffin that covered Luo Tian and Mo Tian.

"Plop..." The blood-red blade slashed the crocodile's mouth, causing it to howl in pain. Blood sprayed from its maw.

At the same time, the maw—now over ten zhang long—closed on the black coffin. "Crack!" The coffin shattered with a thunderous explosion, scattering divine laws beneath the maw. Luo Tian and Mo Tian's faces were grim.

"Open up!" Luo Tian roared, having no other choice but to endure.

In an instant, Luo Tian's hands grasped a cold tooth. His feet stood on the lower teeth. "Crack... crack..." The sound echoed as Luo Tian, with his unparalleled body, resisted the crocodile's biting force. Mo Tian shivered.

"Go first!" Luo Tian ordered Mo Tian, feeling pain in his feet. The cold teeth had pierced through his soles.

"An Immortal King in the early stage? I can't handle you?" Luo Tian's face showed coldness as he fought against the biting force.

"Boom..." Mo Tian escaped from the maw, his hands moving swiftly. His eyes merged again, gazing at the massive crocodile.

"Roar..." The crocodile roared continuously. Its strength was a single burst; if they endured that, its power would weaken.

"Boom..." A black coffin pressed down on the crocodile's massive body, shaking it with a roar. The crocodile wanted to open its mouth but couldn't.

Mo Tian continuously attacked, his martial arts striking the crocodile. The beast howled in pain, blood raining from the sky.

"Crack..." Finally, the crocodile couldn't endure. The tooth Luo Tian held shattered in his hand. Seizing the opportunity, the crocodile shook its head, freeing itself from Luo Tian. The massive body fell into the marsh. The crocodile had been thoroughly beaten by Luo Tian and Mo Tian. It was a Supreme Domain beast, its intelligence no less than humans. Now it wanted to return to the marsh, continuing as its ruler.

"You think you can escape so easily?" Luo Tian sneered. He leaped into the air, landing on the crocodile's head and delivering a punch.

The thunderous sound echoed. A crackling noise rang from the crocodile's head, causing its massive body to twist and tail to swing wildly.

"Die!" Luo Tian continuously attacked, his punches striking the crocodile's head.

"Boom..." Finally, the massive body fell into the marsh. Though half-dead, Luo Tian didn't want to touch the marsh. The immense pressure still existed; he feared being crushed by it and becoming a disaster.

"Go..." Luo Tian, under the immense pressure, struggled to fly five hundred zhang and returned to Mo Tian's side. The two took off toward the marsh's shore.

This time, they encountered no other obstacles. They landed smoothly on a massive stone at the marsh's edge, gazing at the endless marsh with expressions of awe.

"This is just a part of the marsh. Who knows what dangers lie within? Next time, we might not meet these crocodiles!" Mo Tian spoke softly. They didn't immediately step onto the shore but sat cross-legged, adjusting their states. They knew crossing this marsh was just the beginning.

They weren't far from the marsh, gazing at the distance. The place they sat was more like a massive stone than anything else. In the distance, it resembled a city.

"Where is this? How could there be a city?" Mo Tian exclaimed, his first time entering the marsh. Many had entered before but never reached here.

"A city? This city is too large! However, the Lord of Black and White Yan had once entered the Spirit Ghost Marsh and seen this city but didn't go too deep," Luo Tian said, gazing at the dilapidated city. He could sense that this city had once been a powerful force.

"I have a bold idea," Mo Tian spoke, his voice heavy with concern.

"This place was originally a city. It had been at its peak before, and the marsh we passed is this city's moat!" Mo Tian's words made Luo Tian's body slightly pause.

"There's no denying it. This city is much larger than the entire Wheel of Rebirth Temple!" Luo Tian replied, secretly marveling at the danger and great opportunity this city must hold.

"I always feel someone is watching us. Mo, check carefully!" Luo Tian's eyes held a strange light as he gazed at the endless marsh.

"Right," Mo Tian nodded. He trusted his instincts, and the crocodiles' madness seemed suspicious.

As he spoke, Mo Tian's eyes scanned the marsh depths. "Indeed, there are four of them!"

"What?" Hearing Mo Tian's words, Luo Tian's face slightly changed. He hadn't expected anyone to follow them.

"Their power is stronger than regular Immortal Kings in the middle and early stages. It's a bit tricky."

"The crocodiles went mad; it was probably them. Damn, these four are much easier than us!" Mo Tian gritted his teeth, watching the four figures walking on the marsh.

"If we fight directly, we might not be their match. Let's enter this city first. If it gets too bad, we'll ambush them!" Luo Tian replied, his body flashing toward the city.

"Ambush..." Mo Tian's mouth twitched. He hadn't expected such a phrase from Luo Tian, and his image of Luo Tian began to crumble.

Their bodies flashed forward into the city. Upon entering, the scene changed instantly. The ruined city became bustling with noise, as if hearing cries and people moving.

Luo Tian shook his head lightly. The scene returned to its original state. He looked around; the city was filled with piles of white bones, causing both men's faces to slightly change.

"These bones have endured for so many years and still exist!" Mo Tian stepped toward a pile of bones, striking it with one finger. The bones shattered into dust on the ground.

"Even the storage rings can't withstand it!" Mo Tian muttered, picking up an object resembling a ring from the ground. It was covered in rust. As he lifted it, the rust peeled off, and the storage ring shattered in his hand.

A pile of items fell from the ring. Many were no longer usable, but a few still had faint fluctuations—though they weren't particularly useful.

"Supreme-grade divine weapon!" Mo Tian grabbed a long sword, his eyes gleaming with excitement. "Crack..." However, the moment he grabbed it, the sword shattered in his hand.

"Even a supreme-grade divine weapon is damaged? How long has this city existed?" Luo Tian's eyes widened in shock. A supreme-grade divine weapon couldn't withstand it!

"An ancient era? I've entered the ruins of an ancient city!" Mo Tian's face was filled with excitement. If this truly was a city from the ancient era, there might be great cultivation opportunities.

"For now, let's deal with those four on the marsh!" Luo Tian smiled slightly, his eyes gleaming.

"How to deal with them?" Mo Tian's face showed confusion. If they could eliminate them, it would be a major隐患.

"It'll take your help, Mo," Luo Tian said, his hand moving. A copper mirror appeared in his palm. He waved it, and the mirror expanded.

"Evil Obstacle Mirror!" Mo Tian instantly recognized this mirror. After all, he had once been a disciple of the Wheel of Rebirth Temple. How could he not recognize the two supreme-grade divine weapons of the Wheel of Rebirth Temple: the Evil Obstacle Mirror and the Battle Altar?

But Mo Tian hadn't expected Luo Tian to have mastered the Evil Obstacle Mirror. The Evil Obstacle Mirror wasn't something just anyone could master.

"Lu Xiong... you're thinking of..." Mo Tian slightly understood Luo Tian's plan.

The two exchanged a smile and began preparing. Just as Luo Tian and Mo Tian set up their plans, Diao Dezhu's group also reached the marsh's shore. They hadn't encountered the crocodile Luo Tian had injured.

"Based on my years of experience, this ancient city must have existed for several epochs. It's definitely an ancient city," Zhang Chenglong said, his eyes gleaming with greed as he gazed at the distant ancient city.

"The person with Rebirth Grass has stopped moving!" Diao Dezhu frowned, addressing the three.

"Did they find us?" Hearing Diao Dezhu's words, Sun Kelnian and Si Ma Tuo's faces slightly changed.

Chapter 2537: Ambushing

"It's impossible. Maybe they encountered trouble in the city. Our concealment methods are so good that even an Immortal King in the late stage can't find us!" Zhang Chenglong's face showed confidence.

"Don't be so full of yourself. Last time you said that, and the White Family's elder chased us like a rabbit. We were lucky to escape... and that time..." Hearing Zhang Chenglong's confident words, Sun Kelnian and Si Ma Tuo rolled their eyes.

"Blow it out your ass. That was because the White Family's elder had special eyes that could see us..." Zhang Chenglong, hearing Sun Kelnian and Si Ma Tuo's words, was upset. He slapped both of their heads.

"Worlds have rare-eyed people. I don't believe we'll meet them here!" Zhang Chenglong shouted loudly.

"Let's go. The ruler of this epoch is ahead. We'll push through, I want to see what tricks they have!" Zhang Chenglong rarely showed such boldness. He strode toward the massive city.

"This old man knows the person ahead must be an Immortal King in the early stage!" Sun Kelnian's forehead split open, revealing a golden eye. He looked into the city and sneered.

"He wouldn't be so bold otherwise!" Si Ma Tuo also agreed. They knew Zhang Chenglong too well; without absolute confidence, he wouldn't act so boldly. When they encountered an Immortal King in the early stage, Zhang Chenglong hadn't fought directly but chose to ambush. When they met a True Immortal, he revealed himself and crushed them. As Zhang Chenglong said, "Walking by the river, who doesn't get their shoes wet? Doing this job has negative karma. You never know when you'll slip up. A cautious approach ensures a long journey."

"Buzz..." As the four walked, the compass above them emitted a buzzing sound. The needle on it began to spin rapidly.

"Warning!" Zhang Chenglong immediately stopped, gazing at the compass above him. His eyes showed concern.

"Grandfather, go! Crush them and take the Rebirth Grass. Push through this ruin!" Sun Kelnian and Si Ma Tuo urged Zhang Chenglong.

"You don't know anything. This compass, although not a world treasure, has special functions."

"This city holds great danger. It's probably not those two, but the city itself has issues!" Zhang Chenglong said, his voice heavy with concern.

"How? We still have to go in. After all, our main goal is the Rebirth Grass!" Sun Kelnian's face also slightly tightened.

"Let's go," Zhang Chenglong became more cautious, leading the way into the city. Diao Dezhu, Sun Kelnian, and Si Ma Tuo followed closely.

"Buzz..." As the four entered the city, a wave of intense divine light descended upon them. They were stunned and immediately retreated.

"What is this?" Zhang Chenglong's face showed concern. The intense light was blinding, like the sun.

The light faded. A残月 (waning moon) appeared in their vision. Upon seeing it, the four's bodies suddenly froze.

"They've set a trap!" All were experienced individuals. They immediately realized someone had prepared for them here.

But that was just a thought. Their minds were soon replaced by the eyes of the waning moon.

"Buzz..." A black spear appeared at Zhang Chenglong's back, sweeping upward. "Crack!" A large bump formed on his head, and he fell to the ground, blood flowing from it.

The black spear rose, knocking Diao Dezhu and Sun Kelnian to the ground. At the same time, waves radiated from Luo Tian's hands, sealing them.

"It's these four bastards who almost killed us!" The black waning moon disappeared from the sky. The copper mirror, radiating intense light, returned to Luo Tian's side. Mo Tian also appeared.

The Moon Eclipse Eye combined with the Evil Obstacle Mirror enhanced Mo Tian's illusion to its peak. Even Zhang Chenglong, an Immortal King in the middle stage, was caught.

"They're breaking my seal!" Luo Tian spoke softly. He felt they weren't easy to deal with. If they delayed longer, the four would break through.

"Let's just kill them. These people must be from the Immortal Realm!" Mo Tian's eyes flickered, his gaze filled with killing intent.

As he spoke, Mo Tian raised his long sword and slashed toward Diao Dezhu. A black blade flashed out.

Luo Tian grabbed the sword Mo Tian had slashed, causing Mo Tian to be surprised.

"Don't kill them. I have a strange feeling. Maybe they're my old friend!" Luo Tian shook his head gently.

"Uh..." Mo Tian was surprised. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to save these people.

"What should we do? My illusion and your seal won't last long. When they wake up, can we fight them?" Mo Tian's face showed confusion.

"Let them go this time. Next time, we'll kill them. This time, we must give them a lesson they'll never forget!" Luo Tian's face showed a slight smile. This smile made Mo Tian shudder.

As he spoke, Luo Tian began searching the four's bodies. His movements were unusually skilled, and treasures kept appearing in his storage ring.

"Mo Tian, what are you staring at? Come help me!" Luo Tian called out to Mo Tian, who was stunned. He had already stripped the fat man.

"This is too cruel... but these bastards have a lot of treasures. Even their underpants are treasures!" Mo Tian's eyes gleamed with excitement, watching Luo Tian skillfully strip the fat man.

Luo Tian was also puzzled. He seemed to instinctively know where the fat man had hidden things, stripping him completely.

"Live or die—your fate is your own!" After an hour, Luo Tian and Mo Tian tied the four together. Their faces showed satisfaction as they took off toward the city's depths.

Time passed slowly. An hour after Luo Tian and Mo Tian left, a series of booming sounds echoed from Zhang Chenglong. His energy began to revive.

"Boom..." Zhang Chenglong slowly opened his eyes. As he did, he cautiously looked around. A round fat man was in front of him, naked.

"God!" Zhang Chenglong immediately kicked the fat man away. It was too disgusting.

"Damn it!" But Zhang Chenglong's kick didn't move the fat man. He cursed loudly.

"How cold it is!" Zhang Chenglong felt confused, then his mouth twisted. His face turned red, and his body trembled violently.

"Who is it!" A furious roar echoed from Zhang Chenglong. The seals binding them exploded with a thunderous crash.

Sun Kelnian, Diao Dezhu, and Si Ma Tuo fell to the ground. Zhang Chenglong regained a bit of clarity.

"Nothing left! Not even a pair of pants!"

"This time I lost!"

"No matter who you are, I'll kill you. I, Zhang Chenglong, have roamed the nine realms of the Immortal Realm for years. This is my first time losing so badly!" Zhang Chenglong's heart roared, but he didn't wake Sun Kelnian and Si Ma Tuo.

"This embarrassing thing is better not to let them know!" Zhang Chenglong thought, his hands moving swiftly. Divine energy gathered, forming into a piece of clothing in his hands.

Time passed slowly. Zhang Chenglong's clothes were half-formed when Diao Dezhu, Sun Kelnian, and Si Ma Tuo began to revive. Zhang Chenglong's face showed anxiety.

"What happened?" Sun Kelnian opened his eyes, dazed. He looked around.

"Sleep a bit longer!" Zhang Chenglong spoke and punched Sun Kelnian three times, knocking the newly awakened men back to sleep.

"I'm so smart!" Zhang Chenglong's face showed pride. He continued forming his clothes and carefully observed the three's condition. If they awoke again, he would definitely knock them out.

Time passed slowly. Another hour later, Zhang Chenglong's clothes were finally formed and worn. His eyes showed satisfaction.

"Achoo..." As Zhang Chenglong just put on the clothes, Sun Kelnian sneezed and woke up. His eyes were confused.

"What happened?" The three looked at Zhang Chenglong, who stood far away.

"It's a bit cold. This feeling is so familiar!" Sun Kelnian and Si Ma Tuo looked at each other, then saw the nakedness of the others.

"Roar..." Three cries echoed. Sun Kelnian, Si Ma Tuo, and Diao Dezhu cried out in despair, their eyes filled with humiliation.

"Who is it? I've never lost like this before!"

"It's not the first time! This is the second!" Sun Kelnian and Si Ma Tuo roared, recalling their unforgettable past.

"Who is it? This method is so skilled. It's like Luo Tian's bastard trick!" Sun Kelnian and Si Ma Tuo gritted their teeth, thinking of when they had been ambushed by Luo Tian in the nine realms.
