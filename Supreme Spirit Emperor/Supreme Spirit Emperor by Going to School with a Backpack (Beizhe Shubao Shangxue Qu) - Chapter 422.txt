“Finally, it has quieted down!” The people of the Star Moon Divine Clan had finally exhaled a long breath, their lives returning to order without that noise.

“Alas... I never thought this life would be so blissful. I feel this past month has been the most comfortable one of my life!” The people of the Star Moon Divine Clan wore expressions of satisfaction.

After two great battles, their bodies and minds were exhausted. Then came the noise, leaving them without rest for a long time. Their condition had been truly weary, but now, after a month of rest, everyone was full of energy.

“Ah…” However, when people had nothing to do and were chatting, a roar suddenly echoed through the sky of the Star Moon Divine Clan, causing all the clan members to shiver.

“Why does this sound seem so familiar!”

“My god, it's coming from the Great Commander’s place. The Divine Emperor had taken all those ancient ten thousand clan experimentations away, right? How come there's this sound again!” A number of ancient ten thousand clan members wore expressions of fear, recalling the nightmare that had haunted them for over half a year. They all rose and gathered toward Luo Tian’s residence.

“Sigh…”

“This really hurts!” Luo Tian’s face was drenched in cold sweat, his eyes revealing a faint smile. He pulled out the silver needle that had been meant to pierce his soul gate acupoint, muttering softly.

“Again…” However, Luo Tian didn’t care. Using himself as a practice for acupuncture had its benefits—his understanding of his own acupoints was precise, unlike others who made too many mistakes.

“Luo Tian…” Just as Luo Tian was about to prick the needle, a furious roar echoed in his ears. Fu Xingyang strode in with anger, but upon entering and seeing the hall empty of anyone else, Fu Xingyang was slightly stunned.

“Big Brother-in-law, you’ve come!” Luo Tian smiled at Fu Xingyang.

“What are you up to now? Where are the people?” Fu Xingyang felt his head throb. His gaze swept across the hall, finding only Luo Tian and a black giant dog.

“No one else… just me!” Luo Tian wore an innocent expression, responding softly while wiping the sweat from his forehead.

“Then that cry wasn’t you?” Fu Xingyang’s face was filled with doubt; he couldn’t believe Luo Tian, so shrewd, would harm himself.

“It was me… you didn’t give me people, so I came myself…” Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice carrying a sense of helplessness.

“Damn it…” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Fu Xingyang cursed under his breath. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so ruthless. Those people he had taken away were still not recovering.

“Is there anything else?” Luo Tian looked puzzled; he had already pricked himself, so why would those people come to bother him again?

“Don’t make a sound!” Fu Xingyang roared, his eyes filled with anger. He hadn’t expected this to happen.

“Big Brother-in-law, you’re being too harsh. Can I not even make a sound while pricking myself?” Luo Tian also became angry.

“No!” Fu Xingyang didn’t even think, immediately refusing. The Star Moon Divine Clan had just quieted down for a few days; he didn’t want any more problems.

“I’ll make a sound anyway!” Luo Tian was thoroughly provoked, his expression resolute. He had just begun to recover, and Fu Xingyang was making him stop—this was too much.

“Do you still want to marry my sister?” Fu Xingyang’s face showed a smile, his eyes flashing with danger.

“You’re ruthless; you’re the boss!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, his face drooping at Fu Xingyang’s threat.

“Don’t make a sound—don’t make a sound. I’ll endure!” Luo Tian watched Fu Xingyang’s triumphant back, took out the silver needle, and with his spiritual awareness controlled it to pierce into his back.

“Damn…” Luo Tian let out a low growl, cold sweat immediately flowing down again. He had stabbed it off-center in his anger.

Luo Tian quickly pulled out the needle, panting heavily, his face flushed red. However, a fierce look returned to his eyes as the silver spiritual light pierced into his soul gate acupoint.

Time slowly passed, and as Luo Tian continued to torment himself, attempting to seal the curse power within him, the aura of a figure in purple robes sitting cross-legged in the void changed. A series of thunderous sounds rose within Fu Xingxuan’s body.

“Crack…” A breaking sound like a thunderclap echoed from the void, causing the Star Moon Divine Clan members to immediately show tension.

“What’s happening!”

“Is it the Great Commander causing another commotion again?” The Star Moon Divine Clan members looked toward the source of the terrifying fluctuation, their gazes directed at Luo Tian’s residence.

Chapter 1655: Fu Xingxuan Returns ()

“It wasn’t the Great Commander’s doing!” The next moment, the Star Moon Divine Clan members showed shock, their gazes turning toward the cracked sky as gray mist flowed out from it.

“It’s the aura of a准王 (Disciple of the King). Could it be Star Xuan Princess?” The Star Moon Divine Clan members showed excitement, murmuring among themselves.

“Hum…” Waves of energy surged as a purple figure stepped out from the void, her beautiful face carrying a faint smile. Her violet eyes gazed toward Luo Tian’s residence.

“Star Xuan!” As Fu Xingxuan stepped out of the void, Fu Xingyang’s figure immediately appeared before her, his eyes filled with intense joy because he felt the aura of a准王 on Fu Xingxuan.

“Haha, our Star Moon Divine Clan is destined to rise! The Divine Emperor is a准王, and Princess Star Xuan is also a准王. Prince Er from the Thunder Sea Marsh has returned, and he must be a准王 as well!” The Star Moon Divine Clan members immediately erupted in joy. For years, the clan had never been so powerful—so terrifyingly strong.

“Brother…” Fu Xingxuan’s eyes also showed excitement, instantly throwing herself into Fu Xingyang’s arms. She had been away from home for such a long time; she hadn’t spoken properly with Fu Xingyang before, but now that the situation had passed, seeing her beloved brother made her emotional.

“Enough, you’re both grown-ups now; don’t act like children!” Fu Xingyang’s face showed his usual indulgence as he spoke to Fu Xingxuan.

“Come on, you’ve ascended to准王, so that kid shouldn’t come out to see you!” Fu Xingyang’s face carried a slight anger.

“It’s fine…” Fu Xingxuan thought of Luo Tian, her face showing a softness that made Fu Xingyang’s expression slightly unpleased.

“Star Xuan, are you not regretful? That kid is already married!” Fu Xingyang’s face showed concern. His only precious younger sister had been spoiled since childhood, cherished in everyone's hands. Now she was to share her husband with another woman—this made Fu Xingyang’s heart uneasy.

“Yeah, I don’t mind!” Fu Xingxuan’s face showed a hint of shyness. She had fought so hard for this, how could she let it go?

“Truly a daughter who doesn’t stay with her parents. However, we can’t let that kid take advantage of us. When the time comes, you’ll follow our instructions!” Fu Xingyang sneered, then led Fu Xingxuan to the entrance of Luo Tian’s hall.

“Kid, my sister has emerged from seclusion; don’t you come out to see her?” Fu Xingyang roared into the hall.

However, there was no movement within the hall, causing Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingxuan to feel puzzled. The hall had no response at all.

“Let’s go!” They sensed something was wrong and quickly pushed open the hall door, their faces showing concern.

“Boom…” As they stepped into the hall, a powerful soul fluctuation materialized and instantly struck them, causing Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingxuan to stop. Their gazes turned toward the hall.

“Sigh…” They were immediately frightened by what they saw—Luo Tian was covered in silver needles, gray seals flowing around his body, continuously entering into him. The black three-headed dog watched cautiously, its eyes scanning the surroundings.

“This…” Fu Xingxuan’s eyes immediately turned worried. At this moment, Luo Tian looked extremely terrifying—his body was filled with silver needles, sweat constantly falling from his forehead. His entire figure was emaciated, and the ground was covered with water stains.

“What’s wrong with him?” Fu Xingxuan’s face showed anxiety; she hadn’t expected that during her seclusion to become a准王, Luo Tian had turned into this state.

“The curse power has erupted!” Fu Xingyang sighed deeply, then recounted the previous events.

“Those royal clans!” Fu Xingxuan’s eyes flashed with killing intent, her aura turning icy.

“If he has any problems, I’ll make them all die!” Fu Xingxuan gritted her teeth, then anxiously watched Luo Tian.

“Boom… boom… boom…” The thunderous sounds kept echoing within Luo Tian’s body, the gray spiritual soul being incredibly powerful. It continuously fought against the gray soul fire while also diverting part of its spiritual soul to form gray seals, constantly sealing the gray soul fire.

This was Luo Tian’s idea after much thinking—similar to Run Hongyu’s method, but perfected. Previously, Run Hongyu had used one hundred and eight silver needles, while Luo Tian’s number was more than double that. He had completely activated his spiritual soul power, even overextending it.

After a month of exploration, Luo Tian had finally found the acupoints that could activate spiritual soul power. By chance, he had inserted the needles into those points.

However, the gray soul fire was also extremely powerful, constantly eroding Luo Tian’s spiritual soul while fighting against the strong sealing power.

“Suppress it!” Luo Tian roared, invisible waves of energy one after another radiating from his body, continuously blowing Fu Xingxuan and Fu Xingyang’s clothes.

“Hum…” Under their worried gazes, time passed another day. Luo Tian’s expression of pain gradually eased.

“Has it succeeded?” Seeing Luo Tian’s demeanor, Fu Xingxuan showed a hint of joy.

It wasn’t just Fu Xingxuan who was happy; Luo Tian felt immense joy as well. For nearly a year, he had been researching how to seal this curse power again. Now, on his spiritual soul was a black flame mark, and he knew he had succeeded.

“Finally, it’s temporarily suppressed. This was really tough!” Luo Tian sighed deeply in his heart. Although he hadn’t made progress for nearly a year, this curse power had been sealed again. And regarding acupuncture, he had gained considerable experience—now he could accurately prick himself.

“Huff…” Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, just in time to see Fu Xingxuan and Fu Xingyang’s faces filled with joy, looking at him.

“Xingxuan, you’ve ascended to准王?” Luo Tian’s face lit up with joy. He hadn’t expected Fu Xingxuan to have ascended so quickly; after all, when Luo Tian himself had become a Disciple of the King, it had taken a long time.

“Hmm…” Fu Xingxuan saw Luo Tian was fine and nodded, then softly said: “Let’s stay for two more days before leaving. This netherworld still can’t be stayed in too long!”

“I’ll leave, but you’ve just returned. You haven’t even seen your father yet; stay here for a while!” Luo Tian smiled, his reason for not leaving was because he had worried about problems during Fu Xingxuan’s ascension to准王.

Now that Fu Xingxuan had become a准王, his curse power was temporarily sealed. Therefore, Luo Tian had no need to stay here any longer. If he stayed on, it would only bring trouble to the Star Moon Divine Clan.

“Why? Just returned and already want to leave?” As Fu Xingxuan was about to respond, a familiar yet playful voice echoed in the ears of Luo Tian and others. Four figures walked into the hall, their auras radiating power, causing Luo Tian’s group to slightly change expressions.

“Father…” Seeing the people, Fu Xingxuan showed a happy expression and flew toward the tall middle-aged man.

“Haha, my precious daughter finally decided to come back and look around!” Fu Tianba laughed heartily, his authoritative face showing joy as he examined Fu Xingxuan.

“Did you eat a lot of hardships outside? Let me see, you’ve lost weight! That kid didn’t bully you, did he?” Fu Tianba examined Fu Xingxuan while also glaring at Luo Tian.

Standing beside Fu Tianba were Fu Xingyue, Fu Tianqing, and Grand Elder Fu Wenbin. All of them glared at Luo Tian fiercely.

“This…” Luo Tian’s face showed embarrassment, and his heart was also shocked. The Star Moon Divine Clan's power—four people with准王 auras. If combined with Fu Xingxuan and Fu Xingyang, the Star Moon Divine Clan had six准 Kings. This didn’t include Fu Cangshan, who was already a准 King.

“Terrifying!” Luo Tian could only use the word “terrifying” to describe it. Six准 Kings! A single准 King could push back the nine domains before, but if Fu Cangshan lived another life, Luo Tian couldn’t even imagine.

“Master!” Luo Tian bowed to Fu Tianqing, his face showing respect.

“You really didn’t make a mistake!” Fu Tianqing smiled, feeling that his most correct decision was to take Luo Tian as a disciple when he was weak.

“Enough, it’s rare for us to reunite. Let’s have a meal together; we’ll talk later!” Fu Xingyang smiled, with Fu Xingyue and others returning, the Star Moon Divine Clan would definitely be stable. Even if a second-life strong person came to attack, they had confidence to fight back.

Not long after, the Star Moon Divine Clan prepared a lavish feast for Luo Tian and others. They sat there, and Fu Xingyue also recounted the events of the Thunder Sea Marsh to Luo Tian, making his face show a serious expression.

It turned out that not only had Fu Xingyue and others returned, but other royal clans—except for the former准 King Grand Elder—had also awakened. Their strength had ascended to the准 King level, and now the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans had made a qualitative leap.

“Not only that, some old monsters who lived another life haven’t emerged yet. If they do, it might trigger a great battle!” Fu Xingyue sighed deeply, gazing at Luo Tian.

“This is truly bad news!” Luo Tian’s face showed a bitter smile. If another great battle did break out, he wasn’t sure if the human race could withstand it again.

“Also, after dinner, you should leave quickly. We heard about your appearance on the way back. Other royal clans will come to the Star Moon Divine Clan to demand you, and it might become a problem!” Fu Xingyue’s face showed worry. Although Luo Tian felt strong, he knew that those young masters and royal children had also changed significantly.

Chapter 1656: Returning to Old Business ()

“I’ll stay a bit longer. My marriage with Xingxuan, I hope the elders will approve!” Luo Tian’s face showed a serious expression. Although his strength had greatly increased, if a bunch of准 Kings came to trouble him, he wasn’t sure if he could be certain.

But Luo Tian also knew that the Star Moon Divine Clan would have trouble ahead, as they had killed many important people from various royal clans and the ten thousand tribes. And with so many captives, those royal clans would definitely come to find them. How could he stay indifferent?

“No, you must leave. Any trouble we can handle ourselves; if you stay here, it will only bring us more trouble!” Fu Tianqing frowned and disagreed with Luo Tian staying.

“Master, my decision is made. Also, I have some things to do—I need to go to the蛮族 (Barbarian Clan)!” Luo Tian’s face showed determination. If Gu Lei or Zheng Xin saw this expression on Luo Tian, they wouldn’t try to persuade him again.

“Still calling me master, just leave quickly. You don’t know how strong those young masters and royal children are now. Even if the Grand Elder has been a准 King for many years, facing them would still be challenging! If they find you, they’ll definitely join forces to kill you!”

“But we’re different. We are the Star Moon Divine Clan, and our strength is here. Also, some of the royal clans have good relations with us, so we won’t have any big problems!” Fu Tianqing didn’t know Luo Tian’s stubbornness and continued to persuade.

“Don’t worry, we can handle it!” Fu Xingyue’s eyes showed confidence. At this moment, their Star Moon Divine Clan was extremely strong and confident in handling any trouble.

“Moreover, Grand Elder Cangshan has also lived another life, but he hasn’t recovered yet. No one dares to really attack the Star Moon Divine Clan!” Fu Xingyue continued, revealing the clan’s greatest secret.

Hearing Fu Xingyue’s words, Luo Tian’s worries eased slightly, but he still softly said: “I really need to go to the Barbarian Clan and try!”

Seeing Luo Tian’s stubbornness, everyone was speechless. They tried to persuade him again but were refused by Luo Tian.

“Alright, alright, you want to go—go ahead. Your strength is here, but be low-key!” They showed a helpless expression and spoke to Luo Tian.

“Next, let’s discuss your marriage. How do you plan to handle it? With the current situation, it definitely can’t be done now. Let’s talk after everything is slightly settled!” Fu Tianba spoke, as he was more concerned about his daughter’s marriage.

Fu Tianba had three sons and one daughter. Fu Xingchen had died in the Thunderous Palace, and his eldest and second sons were already married with many children. The only remaining treasure was this daughter, Fu Xingxuan. Fu Tianba didn’t want to just hastily arrange it.

“Hmm, my idea is to wait until the great battle ends. If I don’t die, then we’ll proceed!” Hearing Fu Tianba’s words, Luo Tian sighed deeply, his gaze showing regret toward Fu Xingxuan.

Born in a world of chaos and with the battle approaching, this battle would be even more brutal than before. Luo Tian wasn’t sure if he could survive it, as there were too many enemies.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, everyone in the hall fell silent. Luo Tian’s strength was definitely among the top in the nine domains. If he wanted to survive, it should be easy. But his words clearly indicated that he was willing to share the fate of the Four Sacred Star Domains.

“You live, I live; you die, I die!” Fu Xingxuan’s voice, which had remained silent until now, echoed. Her violet eyes were equally resolute as she gazed at Luo Tian.

“Alas, if only you were from the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans!” Fu Wenbin and others sighed deeply. Although the human race’s strength was now strong, in their view, the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans were even stronger.

At that time, the human race had relied entirely on three great masters of Gu Tian. Now, the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans also had strong people who lived another life, even more than the human race. Thus, the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans’ overall strength was definitely superior to that of the human race.

“There’s nothing I can do but try my best to protect my family and homeland from harm!” Luo Tian shook his head gently. He naturally knew the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans’ current strength. Just by looking at the Star Moon Divine Clan, one could see that a clan had six准 Kings. Other clans might have fewer but would not be much different. Plus, some clans had royal children present.

“Alright, let’s not talk about that now. There is still some time!” Luo Tian then showed a slight smile.

“Yes, kid, to marry my sister is no easy task. Come on, first beat us in a test—of course, not in strength but at the table!” Fu Xingyue laughed heartily and raised his cup toward Luo Tian.

“Don’t you dare!” Luo Tian also smiled, as the Star Moon Divine Clan had a close relationship with Fu Xingyue. In Luo Tian’s heart, he had already considered Fu Xingyue as a brother like Gu Lei and Zheng Xin.

They raised their cups, drank them in one go. Of course, they had默契 (mutual understanding) to suppress their cultivation; otherwise, it would be like drinking water and lose the fun.

“Kid, this is just the first test! There will be more later!” Fu Xingyang also smiled and clinked his cup with Luo Tian.

The three of them began to drink, exchanging cups in the hall. However, as time passed, they all showed their true colors.

“Big brother, I want to tell you something—I really hated you when I was little! It almost made us brothers fight!” Fu Xingyue, with his tongue loosened, hugged Fu Tianba’s shoulder and muttered. This behavior would have been unthinkable for Fu Xingyue before, giving him a hundred chances to talk like that to Fu Tianba.

“Get lost… you little bastard, talking to your father like that!” Fu Tianba sneered and kicked Fu Xingyue away.

Luo Tian and Fu Xingyang weren’t much better; Fu Xingyang kept talking to Fu Wenbin, while Luo Tian pulled Fu Tianqing and constantly criticized the price of the Alchemy Hall was too high, saying Fu Tianqing was a cunning old man who used Fu Xingxuan’s popularity to make money.

The three elders were obviously furious and beat the three of them a few times before leaving angrily, fearing they would say more and provoke the urge to kill Luo Tian.

Fu Xingxuan smiled, watching the three drunkards, but felt an unusual warmth in her heart. She hoped this kind of life would continue endlessly.

In the morning, sunlight entered the already bright hall, shining on the gemstones atop it, making them sparkle.

“Ugh…” Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, looking at himself lying in bed, wearing only a single robe. A smile appeared on his face.

But the next moment, Luo Tian suddenly sat up from the bed and slapped his head. The energy of the纪元 (Epoch) surged in his dantian, and a strong alcohol smell came out of every pore on his body. He suddenly remembered what he had said the day before while drunk.

“Damn it, what did I say yesterday?” Luo Tian’s face showed regret. His memory of the drunkenness was gradually returning.

“Little bastard, come out!” As Luo Tian just got up, Fu Tianqing’s voice echoed outside his door.

Hearing Fu Tianqing’s voice, Luo Tian was startled and immediately got dressed, smiling as he appeared outside the hall.

“Master, you’re looking for me?” As Luo Tian stepped out of the hall, he saw Fu Tianqing’s face filled with anger and quickly spoke.

“Haha, don’t call me master. I’ve lived this long, and it’s the first time someone has insulted me! And that person is my disciple! I really took in a good disciple!” Fu Tianqing sneered, his eyes glaring fiercely at Luo Tian.

“Master, what I said was all drunk talk. Please don’t take it seriously. You are my master! The most admirable person in the Star Moon Divine Clan, no one else! If it weren’t for you, the Alchemy Hall of the Star Moon Divine Clan would have already lost its inheritance! My admiration for you is like an endless river…” Luo Tian quickly flattered.

“Flattery won’t work… go do your old job!” Fu Tianqing sneered and threw two iron buckets in front of Luo Tian, a stench coming out from them.

“You are my good disciple; in the netherworld, the Alchemy Hall needs to be rebuilt. You should contribute your part, right? This task you did before, you’re definitely familiar with it. You won’t refuse, will you!” Fu Tianqing coldly spoke.

“This…” Luo Tian looked at the two familiar buckets and showed a bitter smile. He wanted to refuse, but knew he couldn’t fight against the tide. Eventually, he picked up the two buckets.

“Alas… drinking caused trouble!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, watching Fu Tianqing leave and carrying the two buckets toward the newly built Alchemy Hall of the Star Moon Divine Clan.

“Great Commander… he…” The people of the Star Moon Divine Clan saw Luo Tian carrying two buckets, their faces immediately showing strange expressions. Then they remembered Luo Tian’s past experiences in the Star Moon Divine Clan, and their faces showed a hint of smiles.

“Does picking up excrement have an addiction?”

“Hmph, do you know anything? The Great Commander might be nostalgic. After all, he met Princess Xingxuan because of picking up excrement!” People murmured among themselves, their eyes filled with admiration as they watched Luo Tian walking on the road.

Not long after, under people’s curious gazes, Luo Tian climbed into the newly built Alchemy Hall. The layout of this hall was similar to that of the Star Moon Divine Clan’s original Alchemy Hall, so Luo Tian quickly found the latrine.

“Huh?” However, as soon as he arrived, he saw two familiar figures, also carrying two buckets and heading toward the medicinal fields. The two people were Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue.

“Luo Tian… you…” They poured the excrement into the medicinal fields and also noticed Luo Tian’s arrival.

“You’re also…” Luo Tian’s face immediately showed a bitter smile, looking at Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang.

Chapter 1657: Asking for a Person ()

“Drinking caused trouble…” Luo Tian, Fu Xingyang, and Fu Xingyue exchanged glances before simultaneously sighing deeply.

“It’s all your fault; you insisted on drinking with me! Otherwise, I wouldn’t have ended up here!” Luo Tian’s face showed anger as he spoke to them, cursing his bad luck. Every time he came to the Star Moon Divine Clan, he had to end up doing this job.

“Don’t talk nonsense! Later, who insisted on drinking? I was holding my grandpa and talking nonstop!” Fu Xingyue immediately became unwilling.

“At least I still called my master ‘master.’ What about you? You call your father ‘big brother’ and your ancestor ‘grandpa’!” Luo Tian showed disdain, responding.

“You…” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, their faces turned red with anger, but they immediately pulled out their secret weapon.

“It seems you really don’t want to marry my sister!” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang both gritted their teeth, speaking to Luo Tian.

“Big brothers, you’re tired, right? Come on, I’ll take over!” Luo Tian heard their words and cursed inwardly but smiled at them.

“That’s better!” They showed satisfaction, feeling they couldn’t easily let Fu Xingxuan marry Luo Tian. This gave them enough opportunity to torment Luo Tian, and this feeling was quite good.

For the next few days, the three of them doing excrement picking in the Alchemy Hall became a topic of discussion among the Star Moon Divine Clan.

A Star Moon Divine Clan emperor, a prince, and the Great Commander of the Star Moon Guard—human race’s outstanding genius Luo Tian. Three准 Kings, carrying buckets of excrement to do this job. Such a thing was rare and immediately attracted many onlookers.

“Damn it, this is really embarrassing!” Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue had never done such menial work before. Occasionally, they would splash the stuff on themselves, making them disgusted and causing Luo Tian to laugh heartily. Compared to them, Luo Tian was clearly more “professional.”

“Father! Grandpa! Ancestor! We know we’re wrong, can it be enough?” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang kept shouting.

“No use, endure it! These three old men are definitely angry!” Luo Tian showed a bitter smile. Although it was hard, he could enjoy Fu Xingxuan’s massage at night. This life wasn’t bad.

However, Luo Tian felt a bit curious—after several days had passed, the royal clans hadn’t made any move. They didn’t seem to want to come to the Star Moon Divine Clan to demand him.

The more quiet it was, the more uneasy Luo Tian felt. He sensed these royal clans might cause a big commotion or target himself, or the Star Moon Divine Clan. But he guessed it was more likely to target himself.

Time slowly passed, and after three more days, the three of them had picked up excrement for ten days. After being influenced by Luo Tian for ten days, Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang no longer splashed the stuff on themselves. This made them excited for a while.

“Huff…” That day, after the three of them finished watering the medicinal fields and were catching their breath, Fu Tianqing’s voice echoed in their ears: “You three come here. The Ancient Ten Thousand Clans have arrived!”

“Go…” Hearing Fu Tianqing’s words, the three of them instantly disappeared from the medicinal fields and appeared in the Star Moon Divine Clan’s hall.

“Grand Elder…” As they entered the hall, they immediately bowed to Fu Wenbin and the other three.

“Little bastard, throw away your things!” Seeing them arrive, Fu Wenbin immediately spoke to them.

“Ugh…” Hearing Fu Wenbin’s words, Luo Tian and the others were stunned. They looked at each other, having forgotten that they still held the buckets of excrement as they rushed out.

“Okay, okay…” However, soon after, the three of them smiled awkwardly and stepped out of the hall. They threw their buckets into the sky, never wanting to see them again.

“Hum…” The six buckets of excrement were thrown out of the Star Moon Divine Clan’s land, like a streak of light, disappearing from their sight.

“Alright, let’s go back!” Luo Tian and the others showed joy as they returned to the hall.

“Grand Elder, where are they?” Fu Xingyue showed confusion in his face; there was no one else from the royal clans in the hall, only Fu Wenbin and the three others sitting there.

“They should be coming soon. The elders of the previous clans sent me messages through their identity tokens, saying they were on their way. Calculating the time, they should arrive shortly!” Fu Wenbin softly replied, his eyes showing a serious expression. He didn’t know what would happen next.

“Fu Wenbin, is this your way of treating guests?” Fu Wenbin’s words had just finished when a clear voice echoed from outside the Star Moon Divine Clan. At the same time, six figures with powerful auras soared through the sky and landed on the Star Moon Divine Clan’s land.

However, their faces were somewhat grim; they had a slight stain on them, and their eyes burned with anger. They immediately rushed toward the center of the land.

“Qiyuan Hao, you just arrived and already question our hospitality? Isn’t that a bit excessive!” Fu Wenbin sneered, then took a step out of the hall and appeared in the sky above the Star Moon Divine Clan.

“Old friends have arrived!” Fu Wenbin smiled, looking at the six people before him. At the same time, Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang, Fu Tianqing followed Fu Wenbin. Their eyes looked at the six people, while Luo Tian remained in the hall, his spiritual soul power radiating to conceal his aura.

Luo Tian knew he wasn’t suitable for appearing now; he stayed in the hall, observing the people above. If a fight broke out, he would immediately intervene.

“Hmph…” However, after carefully observing, Luo Tian couldn’t help but let out a snort of laughter.

In his spiritual awareness, the six elders stood there. Three of them he recognized—three he didn’t. Observing their auras, he could determine they were from six royal clans.

The three he recognized were an old golden crow, a leader of the Barbarian Clan named Sa Man, and an old ancestor from the Blood Clan. All were strong figures of Fu Wenbin’s era who had now also entered the准 King level. The other three were unfamiliar to Luo Tian, clearly new准 Kings who had just ascended—after all, the previous great battle had seen many Epoch Peak masters slain.

Luo Tian’s laughter wasn’t for any other reason; it was because three of them had some color on their bodies, and that color was familiar to him—exactly the same as the one in the buckets he and Fu Xingyang had thrown out.

“Really a coincidence!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, then continued to observe the development of events.

Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingyue stood behind Fu Wenbin, their eyes also showing a hint of smiles but quickly fading. They wanted to laugh but held it back.

“Fu Wenbin, you’re pretending not to know! We just arrived at the Star Moon Divine Clan’s land and saw six buckets flying out, directly hitting us. What do you mean by this!” The old man called Qiyuan Hao looked angry, gazing at Fu Wenbin.

“I think the Star Moon Divine Clan is strong now and doesn’t respect us other royal clans!” Before Fu Wenbin could speak, the feather clan’s elder spoke with a mocking tone.

“Exactly! I heard they killed many of our people, really impressive!” The old man from the Hun Tian clan also spoke in agreement. However, the old golden crow and Sa Man didn’t speak; although they were also angry, they had some relationship with Fu Wenbin and waited for his explanation.

“Qiyuan Hao, you’ve become a准 King now; do you think you have the right to be arrogant?”

“Don’t forget, I became a准 King when you were still struggling at the Epoch Peak. If it weren’t for the opportunity in the Thunder Sea Marsh, would you have become a准 King?” Fu Wenbin’s face darkened as he heard their words.

“Yes, your status is high, but the old ancestor of the golden crow isn’t any less than yours. They are also your old friends. How can you treat them like this?” Qiyuan Hao’s face slightly changed after hearing Fu Wenbin.

Indeed, when Fu Wenbin became famous, he was somewhat known but still lagged behind Fu Wenbin and the old golden crow. Even after becoming a准 King, when facing Fu Wenbin, he still felt uneasy. He quickly shifted the topic to the old golden crow and other veteran strong figures.

“Haha, old friends, I didn’t do it on purpose. It was my punishment for these two little bastards recently. They threw them out by accident, and you just happened to catch it. Do you believe me?” Hearing Qiyuan Hao’s words, Fu Wenbin smiled and showed a different attitude toward the old golden crow.

“Old ancestor of the golden crow, it was my mistake. I apologize to all the elders here!” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang also seized the opportunity, cooperating well by bowing to the old golden crow and Sa Man.
