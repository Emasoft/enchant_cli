The heavy atmosphere rose throughout the hall, and all present bore solemn expressions. Even the more lively younger generations remained discreetly silent.

On the divine mountain of the Divine Race, Gu Tianshu wore a faint smile on his face. His gaze fell upon two elderly figures whose forms were battered and disheveled. With a flick of his hand, two streaks of black flame materialized before him. The terrifying temperature and oppressive aura spread across the entire divine mountain.

"That's it!" In the depths of the cosmos beyond the domain, Yan Xiuluo and others suddenly paled. Their eyes reflected intense fear. Even from a distance, people could sense the terrifying power contained within those black flames.

"Gu Tianshu. I never expected there to be someone like you in the Nine Domains. Truly unexpected! However, we can sense that your lifespan is nearing its end. You're not much stronger than us; you won't live long!" For the first time, two elders of the Divine Race displayed admiration. Their gazes turned toward Gu Tianshu.

"Destroying you completes my mission!" With a flick of his hand, Gu Tianshu sent two terrifying flames piercing through the void. They instantly appeared before the two elders.

"Ultimate Ascension, Heavenly Deities Sweep the Nine Heavens!" Faced with this terrifying flame, the two elders knew their fate was sealed. They chose their most powerful strike—the final attack of their long years.

This time, they didn't merge their entire cultivation into the Divine King's Nine Heavens Map. Instead, they infused it into the Epoch Treasure, the Emperor Sword.

"My heavens! Two individuals at the middle of the epoch, using their entire cultivation and life essence to activate an Epoch Treasure. Who could withstand it!" From the Divine Race's domain, everyone stood in stunned silence as the two elders merged into the Emperor Sword.

"A hum of energy burst forth from the Emperor Sword, its golden blade radiating an intense cold light. The ultimate purification force rose around it, its might shaking the heavens. Even those at the beginning of the epoch could not withstand this terrifying pressure.

Gu Tianshu's expression suddenly darkened. The two black flames merged, and his form transformed into a colossal giant ten thousand feet tall. His left hand held the Ancient Palace, and his right hand wielded the black flame—like a divine being descending from heaven. He unleashed two astonishing treasures toward the Emperor Sword rushing toward him.

"Boom...!" A deafening explosion echoed in people's ears. Even Yan Xiuluo and others nearly fell from the cosmos due to the terrifying collision.

Numerous warriors spat blood, plummeting downward into the cosmos. The entire Divine Race continent shattered with a thunderous roar. The vast Divine Race continent turned into swirling dust, engulfing Gu Tianshu's colossal form.

"What in the world is happening? Has Gu Tianshu survived?" People wore expressions of tension, gazing at the swirling dust. Their eyes reflected curiosity—everyone wanted to know if Gu Tianshu was still alive.

"A hum..." Golden light rose from the dust, revealing a cracked golden mountain in people's sight.

"It's the Divine Race's divine mountain!" Someone spoke, their eyes filled with suspicion. Yet they weren't overly surprised. After all, it was the most precious gift left by the Epoch Master of the Divine Race. The cracks on its surface indicated its strength.

"Cough... cough..." A soft cough echoed, revealing a resilient figure standing amidst the dust.

"He's not dead!" People gasped in unison, gazing at the ten-thousand-foot figure. However, Gu Tianshu was now in a pitiful state. His body had been slashed by the Emperor Sword, nearly severed in two. Golden blood splattered across the Ancient Palace.

Gu Tianshu coughed violently, returning to his normal size. His face was pale, no longer the youthful appearance he once had. He now resembled an aged figure. The wound at his waist showed no signs of healing, blood continuously dripping down. Black flames surrounded the wound, slowing the rapid loss of blood.

"Leave!" Gu Tianshu let out a light laugh. He implanted the Ancient Palace into the void and took slow steps, exiting beyond the Divine Race's divine mountain. His gaze swept over Yan Xiuluo and others without a word, then he walked away.

People naturally cleared a path. Even Yan Xiuluo and others bore reverence, watching Gu Tianshu slowly walk away.

"Finished! After this battle, Gu Tianshu must be near his end!" Yan Xiuluo and Zhou Tianxing, the three domain masters, wore expressions of admiration. They shook their heads gently.

Everyone sighed as they gazed at the barren divine mountain. The Emperor Sword remained embedded in its body, still radiating an intimidating presence.

"The Divine Race has truly suffered a major setback! Their continent was shattered, leaving only this bare mountain!" People murmured in discussion. They hadn't expected a single Luo Tian to provoke such a massive upheaval. Though the Divine Race had not been annihilated, they had suffered heavy losses.

"Epoch Treasure!" Soon after, people noticed the golden Emperor Sword embedded in the Divine Race's mountain. Their eyes gleamed with greed. The Emperor Sword's power was evident to all. At this moment, the Divine Race was vulnerable. If they could seize the Emperor Sword, it would be truly astonishing.

"Idiots! If it were that easy to seize an Epoch Treasure, it wouldn't be called one!" Yan Xiuluo and Zhou Tianxing's eyes showed disdain. They ignored the fervent gazes around them, leading their descendants away from the scene.

In another battlefield, Diao Yuanshan crushed a saint-level opponent who had surrounded him. A look of contempt crossed his face: "Sun Shengtian, it's still timely to leave. Otherwise, you'll be the one who dies next!"

Diao Yuanshan's condition was very poor. Continuous injuries had greatly limited his strength, but even so, he could still eliminate the three saint-level opponents of the Divine Race. At this moment, the only remaining strong figure in the Divine Race was Sun Shengtian.

"Sun Shengtian!" Sun Shengtian's face darkened. He wanted to devour Diao Yuanshan, but he had no choice. Although his opponent was injured, he was still an epoch-level powerhouse. Even though his strength had plummeted to its lowest point, he still managed to suppress Sun Shengtian completely. If it were a normal half-epoch-level opponent, they would have already given up.

"Luo Tian should have safely retreated. Let's withdraw!" Wan Lingkong shouted to the crowd. Since the battle began, he had never fought directly but instead continuously arranged formations. With Jiang Nanxuan's arrival, the two of them worked together to accelerate their formation arrangement.

"Four Sacred Star Domains people! Quickly come into the formation!" Wan Lingkong shouted to the battlefield. Golden light burst forth from his and Jiang Nanxuan's hands.

"A hum..." The entire cosmos trembled again. Within a hundred miles around them, golden formation flags rose, emitting waves of transmission power.

"Come on!" After completing the formation, the two quickly appeared outside it. A resplendent column of light pierced through the cosmos, appearing in people's sight.

"Follow me! If you rush into this column of light, we'll be safe. We'll be transported out of this Divine and Demon Domain!" Luo Xiong, covered in blood, shouted loudly to the people of the Four Sacred Star Domains.

Chapter 1131: Reunion

On Tongtian Mountain, Luo Tian and the others waited anxiously. Since Luo Tian returned to Tongtian Mountain two days ago, those two days had felt like years. He was on the verge of collapse due to anxiety.

In those two days, Luo Tian's injuries gradually healed. His face had regained a slight flush of color, but he was still weak.

Occasionally, disciples rushed into the hall to report news from the Divine and Demon Domain. However, since Fire Domain was millions of miles away, there were no substantial reports.

"Boom..." Golden light flickered. A powerful pressure spread across Tongtian Mountain. A golden palace appeared in people's sight.

"Ancestral Palace!" Luo Tian's eyes lit up with joy. His body instantly appeared before the massive Ancestral Palace beyond Tongtian Continent.

"I left the Ancestral Palace with Grandfather before I departed. Why has it returned now, but Grandfather hasn't?" Luo Tian felt a bad premonition. Especially when he saw the vast dried bloodstains on the palace, even though they were dry, they still radiated a terrifying pressure.

"That's Grandfather's blood. Could it be..." Luo Tian's eyes reflected sorrow. His premonition grew stronger.

"It's my fault! It's all my fault!" Luo Tian shouted, self-reproaching to the extreme. He could almost see Grandfather's white robe stained with blood, his body dyed crimson on the divine mountain.

"A hum..." Waves of energy burst forth from the Ancestral Palace. A pale, delicate figure appeared in Luo Tian's sight.

"Luo Tian!" Sun Mengru looked troubled. She first showed surprise, then saw Luo Tian's intense sorrow and rushed into his arms.

"It's over now! Everything has passed!" Luo Tian gently patted Sun Mengru's back, comforting her. Though he was also deeply distressed, as a man, he needed to be strong now.

"I'll enter the Ancestral Palace for a while. Wait here!" Luo Tian comforted Sun Mengru, then stepped into the Ancestral Palace's entrance.

"A hum..." The next moment, Luo Tian appeared inside the Ancestral Palace. He saw the artifact spirit Meng Yunxiao and three deputy artifact spirits, as well as eighteen elders.

"Thank you all for your rescue!" Luo Tian bowed to the eighteen people, his face showing gratitude. These eighteen had clearly risked their lives to save him. Now they were seated, healing.

"Kid, you really dared to challenge the Divine Race!" Meng Yunxiao's face was pale. He looked at Luo Tian, obviously exhausted from the collision with the Emperor Sword.

"Master Artifact Spirit, I want to know Grandfather's condition!" Luo Tian directly stated his purpose. He respectfully addressed Meng Yunxiao.

"You mean the strong figure who used the Ancestral Palace?" Meng Yunxiao's eyes reflected admiration. As an artifact spirit of the Ancestral Palace, he had witnessed Gu Tianshu's battle. Even Meng Yunxiao, who had followed the Epoch Master, was amazed by Gu Tianshu's extraordinary talent.

"Yes!" Luo Tian nodded. His eyes reflected anticipation, waiting for Meng Yunxiao's next words.

Meng Yunxiao didn't hide anything. He recounted the details of the battle, then spoke softly: "Although we killed two Divine Race elders, I can sense your ancestor was at his limit. If there's no special method, he won't live long!"

Meng Yunxiao's words struck Luo Tian like lightning. He was stunned, recalling the hunched old man who had always sacrificed for him.

"After the battle, he sent the Ancestral Palace into the void. We returned on our own. As for what's left, I don't know. Perhaps he'll return in a few days!" Meng Yunxiao's face showed admiration.

Luo Tian had learned what he wanted to know. He didn't want to stay long in the Ancestral Palace. After bidding farewell to Meng Yunxiao, he exited the Ancestral Palace.

"Boom..." Luo Tian didn't let the Ancestral Palace leave. Instead, he transformed it into a regular palace and placed it on Tongtian Mountain. After all, the Ancestral Palace had already been exposed; there was no need to hide it anymore.

As soon as Luo Tian appeared, people surrounded him. Lu Han Tian spoke: "According to the disciples who scouted, a large number of injured disciples appeared in the Demon Domain. Someone saw your father among them, as well as Gu Qianxue! Approximately four to five million people were gathering!"

"Has it ended?" Luo Tian's eyes deepened with sorrow. Four to five million people—he clearly remembered that the number of those who had come to rescue him was nearly ten million. In such a short time, they had lost almost half their forces.

"These people died because of me!" Luo Tian shook his head, in pain standing there. He whispered to himself, repeatedly pounding his chest. A few drops of blood flowed from Luo Tian's mouth as if he were suffocating.

"Sorry!" Sun Mengru approached Luo Tian and embraced him. She knew everything he did was for her. Seeing Luo Tian's self-reproach, she felt even more guilty.

"I'm fine!" Luo Tian took a deep breath. He stood motionless under the stars, gazing into the distance, waiting for everyone's return.

Others saw Luo Tian in this state and sighed deeply. They said nothing, standing before him silently.

...

At the entrance of the Demon Domain to the Fire Domain, blood气 (vital energy) was overwhelming. A group of crimson figures stood there. The leader was Luo Xiong and others. After a bloody battle, they had finally broken through Wan Lingkong and Jiang Nanxuan's combined transmission array and were transported to the entrance of the Demon Domain.

"Dead! All dead!" A group of people looked with sorrow, crying loudly. Although the Divine Race had more casualties, their numbers were vast. The total number of dead was twice theirs, but for the Four Sacred Star Domains with shallow foundations, it had already been a devastating blow.

"A hum..." Waves of energy spread. Diao Yuanshan, responsible for covering their retreat, appeared in people's sight with a pale face. His entire body was transformed into a bloodied figure, his gaze deep as he looked at the void.

"The Divine Race dared to come to the Demon Domain. I'll make sure they have no return!" Diao Yuanshan shouted, his voice still strong.

"Thank you, Master!" Luo Xiong and others led the way to bow to Diao Yuanshan. If it weren't for Diao Yuanshan single-handedly holding off all the Divine Race, they might have suffered more losses.

"Cough... cough..." Diao Yuanshan spat out two mouthfuls of blood. He addressed Luo Xiong and others.

"You should return. I'm sure Luo Tian must be waiting impatiently. I need to heal, so I won't go with you to the Fire Domain!" Diao Yuanshan sighed, looking at the people of the Four Sacred Star Domains who had been severely wounded. He shook his head gently.

"Overall, this battle's result was good. War has no deaths. Return and recuperate. The Divine Race suffered such a big loss; they definitely won't give up easily. If the Epoch Master were here, the Divine Race wouldn't dare to touch you. But if the Epoch Master isn't here, then you must be prepared. I can't always be there in the Fire Domain!" Diao Yuanshan gave Luo Xiong and others a final warning before heading toward the direction of the Demon Domain's Holy City.

"Go! Home!" Luo Xiong nodded slightly. He bowed to the direction Diao Yuanshan left, then led those severely wounded people into the Fire Domain.

Time slowly passed. Three days had slipped by again. Luo Tian stood under the stars, like a statue, gazing toward the Demon Domain, waiting for everyone's return.

"Boom..." Under people's anticipation, the stars trembled. The scent of blood rushed into Luo Tian and others' perception.

"They're back!" Luo Tian's lifeless eyes regained a glimmer of vitality. He gazed into the distance, his body flickering and disappearing from the spot, appearing before the army.

"Who!" Luo Xiong and others were on high alert. They immediately gathered their strength, bodies tense, gazing at Luo Tian. When they realized it was Luo Tian, they all sighed in relief.

"It's me, Luo Tian. I'm sorry to you all!" Before Luo Xiong could speak, Luo Tian knelt before the army. His voice was calm but echoed under the stars.

Sun Mengru followed Luo Tian and also knelt beneath the stars. She knew if it weren't for these people risking their lives, she would already be a corpse.

"Come on, child. We've said the Four Sacred Star Domains is your home. Although you're now powerful, we'll always be your support!" Luo Xiong helped Luo Tian up. A smile appeared on his face.

"Yes, Luo Tian, it's okay. War has no deaths. Don't take it to heart. We've always disliked those Divine Race people and wanted to fight them!" People spoke one after another.

"Thank you!" Luo Tian's face showed gratitude. He looked at those familiar faces, only saying two words.

"Is this your sister Yunting?" Three crimson figures appeared before Sun Mengru. They helped her up, gazing at her. Blood obscured the three women's faces, but their eyes expressed strong kindness.

"Yes, I am. Who are you?" Sun Mengru looked puzzled as she slowly stood up, gazing at the three bloodied women.

"Mom!" As Sun Mengru was puzzled, several small figures appeared in people's sight. Luo Xiting and Luo Li stood before the three figures, rushing into their arms.

Sun Mengru's face changed. She wore an awkward expression. These days, although Sun Mengru was in pain, she knew the two children with extraordinary talent on Tongtian Mountain were Luo Tian's son and daughter. Although she had accepted that Luo Tian had a wife, the fact that these three women approached her directly left her unprepared.

Chapter 1132: Gu Tianshu's Return

Outside the Fire Domain's Tongtian Mountain, three crimson figures stood. Sun Mengru wore an awkward expression, momentarily stunned and unsure how to speak.

Luo Tian was also startled. He had been so focused on searching for Chen Yunting that he had forgotten the feelings of the three women. At this moment, his guilt deepened.

"Kid, you've sowed the seeds; now you must reap them!" Luo Xiong smiled, patting Luo Tian's shoulder with his pale face. He strode toward the direction of Tongtian Continent.

"Brother, self-help is your best bet. If you need medicine, find me, hehe!" Gu Lei and others approached, winking at Luo Tian before laughing and flying past him.

Others also wore strange expressions as they said goodbye to Luo Tian, flying into the Tongtian Continent. These people had been severely wounded and needed rest.

People dispersed. Under the stars, only Luo Tian and four women remained, along with Luo Li and Luo Xiting.

"Um... we'll go back first!" Luo Tian wore an awkward expression. In such a situation, based on past experiences, he thought it was better not to speak.

But the next moment, Luo Tian realized he had underestimated Gu Qianxue and the three women. Under their lively presence, Sun Mengru quickly became friendly with them, seemingly forgetting Luo Tian's existence. Occasionally, the four of them would glare at Luo Tian.

"Yunting, I'll tell you something. From now on, we four must work together to keep an eye on this guy. Our group can't grow any larger!"

"Yes! You don't know how flirtatious this guy is!" The four women chattered, gazing at Luo Tian with obvious dissatisfaction.

"Let's go. We'll return first. Once our wounds heal, we'll discuss how to deal with this guy!" The four women joined hands and flew into the Tongtian Continent, as if Luo Tian had never existed.

"Daddy, mommies seem to not want you anymore! Don't worry; both I and my sister will take care of you!" Luo Li lifted her face, rushing into Luo Tian's arms as she spoke earnestly.

Luo Xiting wore a smile. Now that Luo Xiting had matured, she radiated an aura of spiritual energy, resembling a little fairy. She gazed at the distance.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian held Luo Li in his arms and took hold of Luo Xiting's hand. A look of satisfaction appeared on his face as he led his son and daughter into the Tongtian Continent.

As Luo Tian entered the Tongtian Continent, it activated a formation barrier. Everyone's hearts still hadn't relaxed; they were ready for the Divine Race's retaliation.

The four to five million people who had come to rescue Luo Tian suffered serious injuries in the previous battle. They were now all secluded for healing.

Luo Tian gradually recovered, no longer in his previous melancholy state. He entered a period of seclusion for healing.

The entire Tongtian Continent was unusually quiet, with only Wan Lingkong and Jiang Nanxuan constantly walking around it. They cast golden formation flags from their hands.

On the other side, the Divine Race also entered a period of recuperation. After this battle, they had suffered heavy losses. The saint-level masters were almost all annihilated. Only one saint-level master who hadn't gone to intercept Luo Tian remained—Sun Shengtian, who had been severely injured by Diao Yuanshan. The Divine Race's disciples had died in the millions, roughly estimated at over ten million.

The most unbearable loss for the Divine Race was the death of four elders. Not only did they accomplish nothing, but they also enhanced Gu Tianshu's reputation.

Gu Tianshu, the Fire Domain's domain master, had become invisible after his battle with the Divine Race. He hadn't returned to the Fire Domain. Even so, he was a powerful deterrent for the Nine Domains. As long as Gu Tianshu remained alive, the entire Fire Domain would be safe. Unless the Holy Race used their elders, even using an Epoch Treasure wouldn't help. After all, it was well known that Luo Tian could activate the Ancestral Palace.

The entire Nine Domains were discussing Luo Tian and Gu Tianshu. The Divine Race, known for its formidable reputation in the Nine Domains, had been brought to such a state by this young man. Even their entire continent was destroyed, leaving only a bare mountain. It was truly unbelievable.

Although the Divine Race could rebuild their continent, it wasn't a major issue. As long as the divine mountain existed, the Divine Race would endure. However, even so, it was a major embarrassment for them.

After several days of recovery, those who had come to rescue people were gradually emerging from seclusion. They resided on the Tongtian Continent, making it quite lively.

In the Great Hall of Tongtian Gate, the main personnel from both domains were seated. The hall was very quiet.

Luo Tian sat among the crowd, gazing at the elders around him without speaking. He waited for others to speak.

"Luo Tian, when will we return to the Four Sacred Star Domains? It's not good to stay in the Fire Domain forever!" Several elders from the Four Sacred Star Domains spoke to Luo Tian. Although Tongtian Continent was good, it wasn't the same as home. The elders were all sentimental.

"Wait a little longer. Grandfather hasn't returned yet, and I'm still uneasy. Once Grandfather returns, we'll go back to the Four Sacred Star Domains. An Ancestral Palace can't deter the Divine Race. After all, the Divine Race also has the Emperor Sword. If they truly attack the Fire Domain, without the Ancestral Palace, the Fire Domain would be in danger!" Luo Tian shook his head gently. He didn't plan to return to the Four Sacred Star Domains immediately.

"Alas... If the Four Sacred Star Domains had two Epoch-level masters, we wouldn't fear anyone!" Someone sighed. Their eyes reflected expectation as they gazed at Luo Tian and his group. Although the world was changing, they knew that this group might not be able to enter the Epoch level.

Only Luo Tian, Gu Lei, and Jiang Nanxuan had a chance to enter the Epoch level. Or if they were currently at the saint-level peak, they had a chance to enter. As for the so-called Epoch Master, it was still elusive. Although the Nine Domains had rumors about Luo Tian's resemblance to a young Epoch Master, he hadn't truly matured yet.

Time passed slowly. Another seven days had slipped by. During these seven days, people gradually relaxed and no one came to trouble the Tongtian Continent.

That day, Luo Tian was strolling with his four wives and two children. Suddenly, his expression changed. His eyes reflected joy as he flickered away from the Tongtian Continent and appeared outside it.

"What's wrong? Did the Divine Race come? It can't be that fast, right!" Sun Mengru and Gu Qianxue's four women changed expressions. They gazed at the void.

"It's an old man!" Luo Xiting wore a serious expression. She gazed at the void, as her clairvoyant body could see different things.

"Grandfather!" Luo Tian stood under the stars, kneeling before the withered figure of Gu Tianshu. A strange sadness filled his heart.

At this moment, Gu Tianshu seemed to have returned to the state when he was suppressed by Heaven. He was extremely old, with a deep scar on his waist as if it had just healed.

"I'm fine! However, I probably won't see you grow up!" Gu Tianshu's face showed a gentle expression as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"Grandfather!" A group of figures appeared under the stars, kneeling before Gu Tianshu. Their eyes reflected reverence. They knew that without Gu Tianshu, the Fire Domain and Four Sacred Star Domains might have faced another war. It was because of Gu Tianshu's deterrent that they could now live peacefully.

"I will be leaving! I wish to take Xiting as my disciple. If there's an opportunity, I might live another life. If not, I'll pass my teachings to Xiting!" Gu Tianshu smiled as he gazed at the lively Luo Xiting beside Luo Tian, speaking to him.

"Xiting, come here. Greet your old ancestor!" Luo Tian spoke to Luo Xiting with authority. Although he was reluctant, Gu Tianshu's one wish couldn't be ignored.

"Grandfather!" Luo Xiting showed no surprise. It seemed she had known this all along. She calmly knelt beneath the stars, bowing to Gu Tianshu.

"Alright, everyone. Disperse! I'm leaving now. From now on, you'll have to rely on yourselves!" Gu Tianshu smiled slightly. He lifted Luo Xiting and walked away casually, not revealing where he was going.

"Goodbye!" Luo Tian murmured a sigh. Deep down, he didn't want Gu Tianshu to grow old like this—so brilliant.

"Master Gu, I have a petal of an immortal herb here. I hope it helps you!" Jiang Nanxuan's eyes showed respect as he pointed his finger. A petal of black and white energy flew from his hand toward Gu Tianshu's distant direction.

"Thank you!" Gu Tianshu chuckled lightly. He caught the petal of the Heaven-Devil Flower in his hand without looking back, as if he were just an old man. He disappeared from people's sight with Luo Xiting.

"Master Gu, truly amazing! He actually severed himself!" Jiang Nanxuan's face showed a touch of emotion. His voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Self-severance?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He gazed at Jiang Nanxuan, unsure what this meant.

"Master Dongbo Xin told me that some people with great determination who couldn't become an Epoch Master would self-sever, living another life to seek breakthroughs in the next epoch. I suppose Grandfather used the Emperor Sword's power to sever this life!"

"As for whether he can continue living, it depends on Grandfather's fortune. Many people have self-severed before, but few have survived." Jiang Nanxuan's voice conveyed admiration.

"Grandfather will definitely survive!" Luo Tian murmured to himself. He led everyone back to Tongtian Mountain.

Just as Luo Tian and his group arrived at Tongtian Mountain, a tremor rippled across the distant Mortal Domain. The ninth of the Nine Sacred Mortals stood under the hazy stars, murmuring to himself: "The Demon Domain and Shura Domain fought; the Four Sacred Star Domains and Divine Race fought. With several domains weakened, this is the time for the Mortal Domain to rise!"

Chapter 1133: Turmoil Begins

The Mortal Domain had remained silent for countless years, no one daring to provoke it. In the entire Nine Domains, despite its long absence, it was unquestionably ranked first among the Nine Domains.

At this moment, the nine great continents of the Mortal Domain trembled. A group of people in gray robes gazed with fervor, flying out from the nine great continents. They looked at the nine great continents before them.

"Nine Domains are in chaos, turmoil begins. Go forth and kill for immortality! Kill those people!" The ninth of the Nine Sacred Mortals smiled, gazing at the countless gray-robed Mortal Domain people before him.

These people included some who had reached the Super-Immortal level, others at the Supreme level, and some at the Saint level. All of them had fervent eyes, gazing at the ninth of the Nine Sacred Mortals as if he were a god.

"Will you come out?" The old man gazed at the other eight continents, smiling slightly.

"It's not yet time. This epoch has no Epoch Master. With the power accumulated over these years, we can completely destroy them. We must target those major sacred races and turn the Nine Domains into a blood sacrifice!" A deep voice echoed from one of the continents, causing the Mortal Domain people to sigh deeply. The nine continents slowly moved and finally hovered in a strange position under the gray cosmos.

The ninth of the Nine Sacred Mortals smiled, gazing at the countless people before him. His eyes reflected confidence.

"The Epoch Book is particularly important. Let's first occupy the Four Sacred Star Domains and find that kid who has the Epoch Book. No matter what, we must first gather the Epoch Books. Then, using the Four Sacred Star Domains as a base, we'll gradually infiltrate other domains!" The old man's loud voice echoed to the Mortal Domain people, filled with persuasion.

"Go forth! After years of accumulation, today begins. The Mortal Domain will return to the Nine Domains. This time, we'll make the Nine Domains tremble!" The old man continued speaking. He personally used his withered hand to grasp the void, tearing it apart.

"Kill! Countless Mortal Domain strongholds rushed into the void rift like a river of gray!"

At this moment, the Four Sacred Star Domains remained unaware of an impending catastrophic disaster. Because Luo Tian and others had moved most of their sects to the Fire Domain's Tongtian Mountain, the Four Sacred Star Domains were now unusually empty.

Because of fear of Divine Race retaliation, all sects related to Luo Tian had moved into Tongtian Mountain. Only a few Super-Immortal-level sects remained in the Four Sacred Star Domains, and they had little connection to Luo Tian. The rest were ordinary people living on a continent without any ability to resist, as they knew the Divine Race would never attack ordinary people.

"Boom..." As if the end of the world had arrived, in a moment, ten million Mortal Domain troops descended upon the Four Sacred Star Domains. This was the vanguard of the Mortal Domain, led by five Saint-level masters.

Five Saint-level masters descended upon the former Tianyuan Continent. Standing on the Tianyuan Continent, it was almost completely empty now. Only dozens of elders remained to guard it—senior elders from various sects. These people were old and had stopped progressing in cultivation, remaining at the half-Super-Immortal level.

As soon as the Mortal Domain people appeared, dozens of elders sensed it. Their faces turned serious immediately. They instantly appeared in the sky, gazing at the countless Mortal Domain people before them. Their faces immediately darkened.

"Who are you? Why have you entered my Tianyuan Continent!" An elder from the Five Elements Sect spoke tremblingly. These dozens of elders had lived long enough to understand death. They knew these gray-robed strongholds weren't just passing by.

"This is the Tianyuan Continent of the Four Sacred Star Domains? It seems the place isn't wrong!" A Saint-level Mortal Domain strongman frowned slightly. His gaze pierced through the void, discovering that the entire Tianyuan Continent was empty except for these dozens of elders. His eyes showed displeasure.

"Where are the people of the Tianyuan Continent?" The Saint-level person spoke, his voice filled with authority. It was not a request but an order. His powerful aura pressed down on the dozens of elders, making them unable to resist.

"Who are you!" The dozens of elders spoke to the leader of the five Saint-level masters. They weren't afraid of death, but they feared such a terrifying enemy. If Luo Tian returned, it would mean the entire Four Sacred Star Domains would be annihilated. They had received news that people moving to the Fire Domain would return to the Four Sacred Star Domains in the coming days.

At this moment, the dozens of elders prayed silently. They hoped Luo Tian wouldn't return today; otherwise, the Four Sacred Star Domains would not withstand such an attack.

"Rude! You live a little longer, but you're overstepping!" A Saint-level master spoke. His gray hand fell from the sky, covering the heavens and earth, striking down at the dozens of Super-Immortal-level elders.

"Boom..." The dozens of sect elders were only at the half-Super-Immortal level. They couldn't resist the attack of a Saint-level master. Instantly, they were smashed into blood mist and scattered across the Tianyuan Mountain.

"Come here!" However, that master didn't kill all the elders. Instead, he left two alive.

"Mind-rape!" The Mortal Domain elder extended his hand. He grabbed the heads of the two elders, and immediately, the two elders' eyes reflected fear and despair before turning blank.

"Understood!" After a moment, that elder tossed the two corpses aside. A smile appeared on his face.

"This Four Sacred Star Domain has moved everyone to the Fire Domain. Now, the Four Sacred Star Domain only has ordinary people left!" The elder spoke, his voice filled with dissatisfaction.

"Never mind. Let's first complete the ancestor's command and occupy the Four Sacred Star Domain!" The other elders also showed disappointment. They hadn't expected their first battle to be so uneventful, not even needing to fight.

"Kill! Let's blood sacrifice this Four Sacred Star Domain first!" The five elders looked at each other, then transformed into five streams of light. They flew toward the five directions of the Four Sacred Star Domain, beginning to arrange a formation.

"Haha! Finally, I can fight!" The Mortal Domain troops' faces showed madness. They scattered in all directions, flying toward various continents.

The entire Four Sacred Star Domain had no resistance against this terrifying strength. A single Super-Immortal-level strongman could annihilate an entire ordinary continent. The Mortal Domain's ten million troops—what kind of power was that? Soon, the scent of blood spread throughout the Four Sacred Star Domain.
