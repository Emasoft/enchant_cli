“Finished! Impossible to match!” The remaining members of the Five Elements Sect displayed expressions of despair, gazing at the colossal hand with bitter hearts.

Beneath this immense hand, the Five Elements Sect’s disciples could not muster even a flicker of resistance; they lacked the strength to move at all.

“Crack….” Before this hand reached Five Elements Mountain, the sect’s protective array shattered with a thunderous roar, dissolving into swirling primordial energy that was absorbed by the great Qi-hand, further amplifying its power.

“Boom…” A deafening explosion echoed across Five Elements Mountain, which had stood for countless years. In the palm’s strike, it crumbled into ruin, swirling dust filling the heavens and earth. Invisible waves erased all mountains, structures, and landscapes within a hundred miles of Five Elements Mountain.

From the sky, it seemed as if an earthquake had occurred; a hundred miles were shrouded in dust.

The remaining disciples of the Five Elements Sect vanished entirely beneath this strike.

“Disperse!” The old man in the sky waved his hand, and the dust cleared. His gaze held a faint smile as he looked toward a golden light within the dust.

“Demon Lord, I never expected you to still have a trick up your sleeve. But what does it matter? Can your barrier withstand my power?” The old man’s voice echoed as his hands, like withered branches, subtly shifted.

As the old man’s hands moved, a golden Qi cauldron materialized in the sky, crashing toward the barrier arranged by the Demon Lord to encircle Luo Tian.

“Crack…” A crisp sound echoed in the old man’s ears, and fissures spread across the golden barrier.

“Another attempt—finish this thorned opponent as well!” The old man’s hands shifted again, and the cauldron rose once more. He pressed his finger, releasing a thread of gray energy that drifted from his fingertip into the cauldron.

If Luo Tian could see this, he would be astonished: this thread of gray energy was not Primordial Chaos Force but Destruction Power, a force once displayed by Yang Huanyu.

Yet this thread of Destruction Power was entirely different from when Yang Huanyu had wielded it.

The gray Destruction Power transformed the cauldron into a shade of gray upon entry, radiating an annihilating aura that caused the surrounding void to collapse.

“Go!” The old man pressed his palm downward, striking the already cracked golden barrier with all his might.

If this strike landed, even Luo Tian—having glimpsed a fragment of Primordial Chaos Force and reaching the peak of Soul Consolidation—would suffer grievous injury.

Chapter 715: The Sovereign of a Realm ()

Chapter 715: The Sovereign of a Realm

Tianyuan Continent, Northern Domain, Five Elements Sect.

A gray hand, radiating destruction, advanced toward the golden barrier. Around it, the void continuously collapsed, as if heralding the end of days, revealing glimpses of stars.

“Ten thousand zhang… a thousand zhang… a hundred zhang…” The golden cauldron had barely taken a moment to approach Luo Tian, seated within the barrier, by a hundred zhang.

Yet as the cauldron neared the golden barrier, Luo Tian—his face serene—suddenly opened his eyes. His body was enveloped in gray energy, and his aura surged skyward.

“Go…!” Thunderous roars erupted from Luo Tian’s mouth, and his face shifted from serenity to an endless chill.

As the word “Go” left Luo Tian’s lips, the temperature across the Five Elements Sect’s hundred-mile radius abruptly dropped, as if plunging into an eternal winter. The hand striking the golden barrier hesitated.

Seizing the moment, Luo Tian slowly rose, gazing at the scene with a face dark as rain. He clenched his fist and launched it forward.

“Boom…!” Luo Tian’s fist collided with the gray cauldron, producing a thunderous sound.

“Destruction Power? An old foe?” Luo Tian’s face bore admiration, sensing the Destruction Power within the cauldron. His expression carried a hint of confusion.

“Should I call you Yang Huanyu or Master Wangyue?” Luo Tian coldly spoke, his gaze fixed on the withered old man in the sky.

“Correctly speaking, I am Master Wangyue!” The withered old man replied, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian standing there. His face bore a solemn expression.

At this moment, Luo Tian’s presence felt overwhelmingly powerful—so much so that it stirred a desire to retreat within the old man. He had not felt such an emotion in years, not even when he had been severely wounded and encountered the Demon Lord.

This old man was the fleshly body of Master Wangyue before his reincarnation, and the soul within this body was a fragmentary soul of Yang Huanyu.

Though his strength had slightly declined, he remained an authentic Realm-尊 level powerhouse. Yang Huanyu had not anticipated Luo Tian’s current strength to be so formidable.

“Fine, regardless of who you are, today marks your end as the first Realm-尊 I shall slay after attaining this title. After killing you, I will eradicate all these Tianshi Sect scum and restore peace to the Tianyuan Continent!” Luo Tian spoke coldly, his robes fluttering without wind. His face bore an icy expression, and a radiant barrier expanded around him.

“Domain!” Master Wangyue’s face bore astonishment, never expecting Luo Tian—just entering the Realm-尊 level—to have mastered a Domain.

A Domain, as its name suggests, is a realm. It is the unique technique of Realm-尊 level cultivators, where one’s aura and spiritual awareness coalesce into a barrier. Within this Domain, the master becomes the sovereign of all existence; even another Realm-尊 would suffer a drastic reduction in power, crushed by the Domain’s master.

“Do you think only you possess a Domain?” Master Wangyue sneered, his body radiating outward.

Ten zhang… a hundred zhang…

Luo Tian’s seven-colored Domain and Master Wangyue’s gray Domain collided, producing a cacophony of friction. Cracks formed at their intersection in the void.

“Creak… creak…” A trembling sound echoed within Luo Tian’s ears, causing his eyes to narrow.

“Not good. My recent ascension to Realm-尊 has left my cultivation unstable, while this opponent’s mastery of the Domain far surpasses mine. Moreover, his Destruction Power suppresses my seven attributes!” Luo Tian mentally calculated, an invisible opportunity forming between them.

“Split Sky Spear!” Luo Tian could no longer contain himself, summoning the Split Sky Spear.

As the spear landed in his hand, Luo Tian hurled it toward Master Wangyue.

“Woo…” A resonant sound echoed, and the Split Sky Spear transformed into a black blur, streaking toward Master Wangyue.

“Plop…” As the spear flew out, their clashing Domains were pierced through.

The opportunity led to both Luo Tian and Master Wangyue’s Domains collapsing with a thunderous roar.

Yet the Split Sky Spear did not halt; it instantly appeared before Master Wangyue, lunging toward his heart.

“Return!” Master Wangyue remained calm, his withered hand seizing the void.

With a single grasp, the spear—once moving at lightning speed—was firmly caught by Master Wangyue. The spear’s tip was mere inches from his heart, and Master Wangyue had only taken a few steps back.

Master Wangyue clutched the spear, then slammed his palm onto its tail. A black glow flared again, and the spear transformed into a streak of light, returning toward Luo Tian.

“Hmph?” Master Wangyue’s face turned puzzled; in his vision, Luo Tian had not even dodged. Instead, he stood motionless, allowing the spear to strike him.

“Shadow!” Master Wangyue’s face shifted, murmuring as Luo Tian’s figure appeared before him.

“Mist of Life!” A gray fist, infused with endless gray energy, struck Master Wangyue’s chest with a crisp sound.

Under the Mist of Life punch, Master Wangyue’s already withered body transformed into a long streak of light, propelled into the void.

“Again!” Luo Tian knew this punch would not kill Master Wangyue. He stepped the Sealing Heaven Step, instantly appearing in the endless void and locating Master Wangyue’s figure as it flew backward.

Luo Tian, now a Realm-尊 level powerhouse, had surpassed his previous speed at Soul Consolidation peak. Even lightning could not match his current velocity.

“Reincarnation!” Luo Tian’s figure instantly appeared before Master Wangyue, launching a storm of attacks.

Master Wangyue, an ancient monster who had lived countless years, though reincarnated as Yang Huanyu and possessing only a fragment of his soul, could not match Luo Tian’s speed. Though Master Wangyue was momentarily stunned, he quickly composed himself and faced Luo Tian without fear.

Two Realm-尊 level masters clashed in the endless darkness, engaging in a life-or-death battle. Luo Tian closed his eyes, swiftly entering the state of unity with heaven and man. Master Wangyue, relying on his countless years of experience, did not fall behind. Thunderous roars continuously formed before them; if others were present, they would have been astounded. The mere collision waves from their fight could not be endured by Soul Consolidation level cultivators.

Chapter 718: A Bitter Conclusion ()

Chapter 718: A Bitter Conclusion

Leng Qiuchan and Gu Qianxue’s faces were pale, their expressions filled with disbelief as they gazed at the Book of Epochs in the sky. As Luo Tian’s closest companions, they naturally knew about the miraculous golden book within his body.

Now, this book—never before separated from Luo Tian—was in Master Wangyue’s hands. Considering Long Jie’s words earlier, both of their faces bore pain.

“Puke…” Luo Tian’s mother, Zhang Qiuyue, was even more direct; she spat blood, her face contorted with madness. Her aura surged violently as she raised a long sword and charged toward Yang Huanyu and Master Wangyue.

“Qiuyue, return!” Luo Nantian’s face bore a touch of sorrow, but reason overpowered his hatred. He intercepted Zhang Qiuyue before she could reach Master Wangyue.

Seeing the reactions of those close to Luo Tian, others from the three domains displayed sighs, guessing that something had happened to Luo Tian.

“Rest easy; your brother isn’t dead. I just feel he’s weak, even unable to locate him!” Due to the contract, Long Jie could sense Luo Tian’s current condition. Seeing everyone ready to fight, he quickly spoke to reassure them that Luo Tian was safe.

“Luo Tian is indeed fine!” Zhang Daotian also spoke, sensing Luo Tian’s condition through the Soul-Calling Jade. However, he too could not determine where Luo Tian was located.

“If he’s alive, there is still hope!” People spoke, but their gazes were filled with deep concern.

“I’m going to find Luo Tian!” Gu Qianxue spoke, her gaze resolute. To her, the survival of the entire Tianyuan Continent was nothing compared to Luo Tian’s life.

“I’m going too… I’m going too…” As Gu Qianxue’s words ended, Leng Qiuchan also displayed determination, speaking softly. Others who had a slight connection to Luo Tian also spoke up.

“Alas…” The three Realm-尊 masters exchanged glances, their faces bearing a bitter smile. The Northern Domain’s Ice Pole Island would surely withdraw to search for Luo Tian, as would the Five Elements Sect. Other sects closely tied to Luo Tian would also search for him. Thus, this preemptive attack had no meaning at all; if people left, the morale would collapse.

The three Realm-尊 masters exchanged bitter smiles, their gazes filled with resentment. They had arrived in the Western Domain to attack the Tianshi Sect with fierce intent, but losing Luo Tian caused their morale to collapse.

“Alas… it’s my fault; I didn’t anticipate Master Wangyue having this trick. Clearly, he took advantage of our presence to strike at Luo Tian!” The Demon Lord spoke, beginning to criticize himself.

Zhang Daotian and Yin Tianxiong had not expected Master Wangyue to pull this move. They sighed lightly, “Well, the priority now is to find that kid. I’ll go with the Demon Lord; Yin Xiong, keep an eye on Master Wangyue’s movements. If anything happens, notify us!”

After Zhang Daotian spoke to Yin Tianxiong, he issued a series of commands. The Five Elements Sect, Ice Pole Island, and Yu Ling Sect combined forces to search for Luo Tian’s whereabouts. Other sects withdrew from the Western Domain but surrounded it.

Though only three sects, their combined disciples numbered nearly six million; remember, the Five Elements Sect was the largest sect on Tianyuan Continent.

Moreover, the search area was limited to the Northern Domain; if everything went smoothly, they would complete a full sweep of the Northern Domain within half a month.

After Zhang Daotian and the others issued their commands, the sect members’ faces bore anxious expressions as they rushed toward the Northern Domain. The Northern Domain became lively again instantly.

Luo Tian’s portrait was everywhere, displayed in cities of all sizes. The sky and ground were filled with Five Elements Sect disciples, as well as those from Ice Pole Island and Yu Ling Sect.

Luo Tian remained unaware of this; after stepping the Sealing Heaven Step, he fell into unconsciousness. He had no idea what form he would take or where he would end up.

……

In the far eastern part of the Northern Domain, a small fishing village stood. Due to its proximity to the border between the Northern and Eastern Domains, the sea, villagers had long relied on fishing for survival. Some cultivators sought opportunities in the Sea of北海, often renting or buying boats from villagers, making this village relatively prosperous.

At the moment, a boy around ten years old sang a fishing song while rowing his boat in the water, leisurely casting his net.

The boy’s name was Dong Yichen, a child from an ordinary family in the village. The Dong family had long relied on fishing for survival; their household was neither poor nor rich.

Dong Yichen skillfully reeled in his net, a look of excitement on his face—today’s catch felt heavier than usual.

“Looks like I’ll get a good price today!” Dong Yichen smiled, biting his lip and pulling the net into his boat.

“Plop…” However, the next moment, Dong Yichen’s face showed fear; within the net—expected to hold fish—there was instead a person.

And it was an old man, his withered skin, deep wrinkles, and white hair made Dong Yichen unable to believe his eyes. He rubbed them in disbelief.

“Ah… Mother!…” Dong Yichen was only eleven years old, but his long years of fishing had made him appear more mature than his peers and stronger in physique. Yet he was still a child.

Living by the Sea of北海 for years, Dong Yichen had heard many tales about sea monsters and water ghosts. This figure, though appearing human, could be a monster in disguise. Even if it were a person, Dong Yichen didn’t believe this old man could survive.

“Who are you?” Dong Yichen, mustering his courage, asked the old man, his gaze filled with fear.

“Dead?” Dong Yichen cautiously approached the old man, gently prodded his robe, then checked his nose for breath. He exhaled relief; from his judgment, the old man had likely drowned and didn’t seem like a villain. Plus, his kind heart made him exhale relief.

“You’re lucky to have met me; if it were anyone else, they might’ve thrown you back!” Dong Yichen muttered to himself, approaching the old man and pressing his hands against his chest, gently pushing.

Dong Yichen dared not press hard; he feared breaking the old man’s bones with a single move.

“Cough… cough…” As Dong Yichen assisted, the old man spat out two mouthfuls of water and slowly opened his eyes, filled with confusion.

Chapter 719: The Old Madman ()

Chapter 719: The Old Madman

In the Northern Domain, the Sea of北海 fishing village, Dong Yichen sighed as he rowed his boat back to shore, cursing his bad luck.

He hadn’t caught a single fish but instead pulled up an old man. And this old man was clearly abnormal, constantly smiling foolishly or showing painful expressions on his weathered face.

“Yichen has returned, right? Who is this old man? Is he your long-lost grandfather? Ha!” The fishermen on the shore teased Dong Yichen as they saw him leading an old man.

“Don’t be silly; I’ve had bad luck. This old man is mad, alas…” Dong Yichen spoke like a responsible child, shaking his head.

“Old man, where are you from? I’ll send you home. Your clothes don’t look like those of a rich person, alas!” Dong Yichen walked along the shore, passing by boats until he reached a small courtyard.

The house was simple and somewhat messy but kept clean. Fishing nets hung in the sun, emitting a faint fishy scent within the courtyard.

“Old man, speak up! You don’t plan to follow me forever, do you? I can’t afford to feed you!” Dong Yichen saw the old man smiling foolishly at him, as if he had chosen him. He was impatient and spoke.

“Little brat, you’re back? Where did you catch the fish?” Just as Dong Yichen led the old man to the door, a domineering voice echoed in his ears. Dong Yichen shivered.

“Uncle, I didn’t catch any fish… I caught a person!” Dong Yichen’s face bore fear as he saw the middle-aged man step out from the courtyard.

“What? No fish? You dare to return without catching any? Don’t you know your sister is critically ill and needs money for medicine?” The middle-aged man, upon hearing Dong Yichen’s failure to catch fish, grew even more violent. He grabbed Dong Yichen and lifted him, then slapped his face.

“Smack…” The crisp sound echoed; Dong Yichen’s frail body flew backward, landing on the ground in a clumsy manner.

“Father, don’t hit little brother! He didn’t mean to!” A pale-faced girl stepped out from the dilapidated house, approaching the middle-aged man and pleading.

“Get lost; no fish, how will you buy medicine for her?” The middle-aged man was gentler with the girl but still pushed her away.

“Hmph, bringing back this old fool; do you think I have enough burdens already?” The middle-aged man saw the old man smiling foolishly at the door and was enraged. He approached the old man and kicked him without hesitation.

“Uncle, don’t do that; I’ll send him away and go fishing again. He’s very pitiable!” Dong Yichen, seeing the middle-aged man’s actions, quickly spoke.

His rescue of this old man seemed fragile, as if a breeze could knock him over.

This middle-aged man was known in the village as a tyrant—lazy, fond of fighting, and having squandered all his money and the years he had extorted into the town’s gambling house.

If it weren’t for Dong Yichen’s fishing over the years, he and this middle-aged man’s daughter would have starved to death.

Even so, the middle-aged man showed no pity and often returned home demanding Dong Yichen’s fishing money for gambling.

Dong Yichen refused, and the middle-aged man would beat him up with fists and kicks. Dong Yichen was only eleven, no match for the middle-aged man. After each beating, the middle-aged man would rummage through his belongings and leave triumphantly.

Dong Yichen’s words had no effect on the middle-aged man, instead inciting his aggression. His thick foot kicked with full strength.

“Plop…” However, the next moment, Dong Yichen was stunned; his despised uncle flew backward like a kite.

The old man, who appeared as frail as a withered leaf, remained standing there, smiling foolishly.

“What’s going on? Could this old man be a god?” Dong Yichen, though young, had heard of cultivators on the Tianyuan Continent who could withstand blades and fly through the skies.

The middle-aged man’s face bore disbelief, his entire body falling to the ground. More terrifying was that his leg, which had kicked the old man, seemed fractured and twitched uncontrollably.

“God?” The middle-aged man’s heart filled with fear, his face showing panic. He never expected that this nephew of his had rescued a god-like figure.

Thinking this, the middle-aged man’s eyes flickered with greed as he looked at the old man.

But the old man seemed to ignore him, still smiling foolishly and obediently following Dong Yichen.

This made Dong Yichen lose his composure, recalling the legends of cultivators. He realized this old man might be a significant figure. Thinking he had rescued an important person, Dong Yichen was overjoyed.

“Yichen! Come here!” The middle-aged man smiled, limping up and addressing Dong Yichen.

“Uncle… Uncle… what’s wrong?” Dong Yichen, though aware of the powerful figure behind him, still instinctively feared the middle-aged man. His speech was hesitant.

“I’m sorry; I’ve wronged you these years. To show my apology, how about this: I’ll pay for the medicine to cure Yan’er’s illness. Is that okay?” The middle-aged man winced, his leg aching, and forced a smile he considered kind.

“Ugh…” Dong Yichen, though young, was not foolish; he had matured beyond his years.

Dong Yichen naturally knew that his uncle was scheming again, but thinking of his critically ill sister, he bit his lip and nodded without speaking.

Seeing Dong Yichen nod, the middle-aged man’s face lit up. He grabbed a wooden stick as a crutch and slowly stood, addressing the little girl behind him: “Qing’er, stay at home. I’ll go with your brother to town to get medicine; once we return, her illness will be cured!”

The little girl seemed unfamiliar with her father but was still a child of five or six, kind-hearted. She nodded obediently and stepped into the house.

Chapter 720: Shuiyou Town ()

Chapter 720: Shuiyou Town

Shuiyou Town, a small town in the Eastern part of the Northern Domain, was just a few miles from the Sea of北海. Often, cultivators exploring the Sea of北海 would stay here. Though not large, it was common to see Body-Refining level cultivators.

At this moment, three figures appeared on Shuiyou Town’s street. The first was a middle-aged man limping, followed by an eleven-year-old boy with a hesitant expression. The boy’s back was occupied by an old man, his face occasionally smiling foolishly or looking confused and painful but always obediently following the boy.

“Hey… Dong Sanzhuang, are you crazy? Come to sell your nephew?” The townspeople recognized the middle-aged man. Seeing him enter the town, they wore scornful expressions. Upon seeing Dong Sanzhuang limping, they were delighted and mocked him.

Dong Sanzhuang ignored the mockery and led Dong Yichen and the mad old man to a clinic. His face bore a sly smile as he spoke to Dong Yichen: “Yichen, listen carefully; do you hear me?”

Dong Yichen was puzzled but nodded. He led the mad old man into the clinic.

The three entered the clinic, immediately drawing attention. Dong Sanzhuang was notorious in their village and town for stealing and cheating. Though noticed, no one spoke; the assistants were busy with their tasks.

“Smack…” However, the next moment, Dong Sanzhuang changed completely. He approached the counter and slammed his wooden stick against it.

“Robbery! Niu Liu, give me all your clinic’s money!” Dong Sanzhuang wore a confident expression as he addressed a young assistant.

The clinic fell silent instantly. Dong Yichen’s face changed; he hadn’t expected Dong Sanzhuang to rob the clinic.

“Dong Sanzhuang, you’ve really gone mad! Do you know where this is?” The assistant named Niu Liu sneered.

Before Niu Liu’s words ended, several youths rushed out from the back door, their faces showing hostility. They carried a faint aura—clearly Body-Refining level cultivators, though only at the second stage. Still, they were not someone like Dong Sanzhuang to offend.

“Yichen, make this mad old man knock these people down!” Dong Sanzhuang smiled triumphantly and ordered the boy behind him.

“Boom…!” However, the next moment, a frail figure rushed into the clinic’s herb storage area. Wooden barriers shattered in an instant, turning to dust and swirling smoke.

“This…!” The youths who had rushed out were stunned; the barriers separating herbs were wooden, but they knew these were sturdy wood obtained by their master. They had tried before and even the strongest among them at Body-Refining third stage couldn’t break it.

Yet, in front of this mad old man, they were as useless as paper.

“Good! I was right; this old man is definitely a fierce one!” Dong Sanzhuang, seeing his words worked, wore a delighted expression.

“Hmph! You saw it, right? This elder needs money; you should all give him everything. Otherwise, he’ll punish you!” Dong Sanzhuang addressed the stunned youths.

“Crack… crack…” However, the mad old man ignored their gazes and devoured herbs from the counter, eating them without care for what they were.

“This… this old man is a monster!” The Body-Refining second stage youths, faces filled with shock, watched the mad old man devouring herbs.

“Still standing there? Hurry up and get it!” Dong Sanzhuang, seeing the youths hesitate, shouted loudly.

Dong Sanzhuang’s heart was elated; these Body-Refining youths had long been untouchable in Shuiyou Town. Now, they were under his command. Dong Sanzhuang knew from now on, with this mad old man, he would be unchallenged in Shuiyou Town.

Dong Yichen’s face was pale, sweat pouring down as he watched the mad old man devouring herbs. He knew clearly that even if he fished for a lifetime, he couldn’t afford these herbs.

“Old madman, stop eating! Hurry up!” Dong Yichen approached the mad old man and spoke.

The mad old man, who had been eating joyfully, paused momentarily but then ate even more eagerly.

“Hmph! A madman; even if you’re powerful, daring to cause trouble in our clinic, we won’t let it go!” One of the Body-Refining third stage youths frowned and rushed toward the mad old man.

Others also showed hostility, rushing toward the madman. Two of them approached Dong Sanzhuang.

“You guys want to do what? Yichen, make the old madman knock these people down!” Dong Sanzhuang saw two approaching him and quickly spoke to Dong Yichen.

However, the mad old man seemed unaware of anything, continuing to eat herbs with a blissful expression.

Five Body-Refining third stage disciples stood before the mad old man, their glowing fists striking him.

“Finished!” Dong Yichen collapsed to the ground, his face pale. He gazed at the mad old man but then displayed determination.

To him, these five were almost like gods; even if the mad old man was powerful, he didn’t believe he could withstand five simultaneous attacks.

“Old madman, I brought him here; if it weren’t for me, he wouldn’t be here!” Thinking this, Dong Yichen somehow found the strength to stand up and rushed in front of the mad old man.

“Boom… boom… boom…” A crisp sound echoed in the crowd’s ears, and five figures flew backward like kites.

“He… you can’t harm!” The mad old man appeared before Dong Yichen, his eyes briefly clear as he spoke, but the next moment, they turned murky again.

Chapter 721: Why You Again ()

Chapter 721: Why You Again

“Boom…” Five figures lay on the ground, their faces filled with shock as they gazed at the mad old man who had devoured most of the herbs.

“This… Shuiyou Town’s clinic was smashed?” The onlookers bore disbelief, gazing at the old man beside Dong Yichen.

Dong Yichen’s face bore determination, his eyes closed as he awaited the five’s attack. But in an instant, five thuds made him slowly open his eyes, filled with confusion.

Dong Yichen opened his eyes and widened them, gazing at the five figures lying on the ground. He was speechless for a moment.

“Ah…” A scream drew everyone’s attention; Dong Sanzhuang was not so lucky. His other leg, once healthy, was also broken by two Body-Refining second stage youths. He lay on the ground, crying out in agony.

“What’s going on?” The two youths who had broken Dong Sanzhuang’s leg bore a solemn expression, gazing at the five figures lying on the ground.

“A tough opponent; we’re not their match. Hurry and call your master!” One of the youths lying on the ground spoke to them.

“Good!” The two youths didn’t hesitate, lighting a black incense from their storage bags and waiting for their master’s arrival.

“Old madman, we should leave quickly!” Dong Yichen’s face bore fear as he snatched a handful of herbs from the old man, knowing these were the herbs to cure his sister. Since they had been devoured nearly entirely, he decided to take them and heal her first.

Hearing Dong Yichen’s words, the old man placed the last herb in his mouth and belched. Green light radiated from him, an invisible wave emanating from his body.

The onlookers’ faces bore shock; they couldn’t believe their eyes, staring blankly at the old man radiating green light.

At this moment, the old man seemed like a king, but only for an instant; the next moment, his figure returned to that of a mad old man.

Dong Yichen also felt the old man’s change, his face filled with confusion. He felt that this moment had changed the old man significantly.

However, the old man’s face bore no expression; he returned to his foolish smile and obediently followed Dong Yichen.

“Let’s go!” Dong Yichen, seeing this, bore a helpless expression and pushed his legs forward, rushing toward the clinic’s entrance.

“Yichen! Save your uncle!” As Dong Yichen just stepped out of the door, Dong Sanzhuang’s pitiful voice echoed in his ears. Dong Yichen’s small body trembled slightly.

Dong Yichen gazed at Dong Sanzhuang with a complex expression, his eyes filled with endless disappointment. He had hoped his uncle had changed, but it turned out he was using the mad old man’s power to rob.

He gazed deeply at Dong Sanzhuang before rushing through the crowd, ignoring the broken-legged Dong Sanzhuang.

The old madman smiled foolishly and followed Dong Yichen, pushing through the crowd.

The people around parted a path; no one dared to block this old and young pair. Even cultivators couldn’t match the mad old man, let alone these onlookers.

“Boom…” However, as Dong Yichen just stepped out of the crowd, he collided with someone, knocking him backward several steps and falling onto the old man.

“Who dares to mess with my clinic!” A senior appeared in people’s sight, his body lacking any cultivation aura but exuding a royal authority.
