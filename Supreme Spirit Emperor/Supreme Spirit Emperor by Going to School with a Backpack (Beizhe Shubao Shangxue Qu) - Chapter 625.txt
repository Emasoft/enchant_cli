Luo Tian still remembered the bloodshed of the Shenglong Sect years ago. The sect had nearly been annihilated, and this grudge remained etched in his heart. This time it was again the Sha Wang Pavilion.

How could Luo Tian allow these people to leave safely? He had to kill a few sect masters to establish his authority. Moreover, Tianyuan Sect aimed for the heavens; it was likely they would clash with one of these sects. Weakening their strength now was also beneficial.

"Good!" The four sect masters almost didn't hesitate to agree. They were four half-step Immortal Kings, and even if Luo Tian was strong, he couldn't possibly match them.

Chapter 2356: Earthly Dogs and Clay Ducks

"Single-handedly facing four half-step Immortal Kings?" People's faces showed surprise, thinking Luo Tian had gone mad. The crisis in Sha Hai City had just been resolved, yet Luo Tian was gambling with the city as his stake, risking four sect masters' lives—this seemed incomprehensible.

"Everyone step aside!" Luo Tian smiled and addressed the crowd. He knew these four would comply.

"If Luo Tian insists on gambling, we won't be courteous!" Tian Yong and the others smiled, signaling their subordinates. Unaware of their proximity to death, they scattered, leaving ample space for the five.

"Begin!" Ye Tian barked, his eyes filled with interest as he watched Luo Tian and the four sect masters.

"Boom..." Before Ye Tian's words faded, the five moved simultaneously. Luo Tian formed hand seals, his feet pressing into the ground as he unleashed the Heaven-Emperor's Art, enveloping himself within a hundred zhang radius. In an instant, he closed in on the four sect masters and launched a punch toward the leader of Feishen Sect.

Luo Tian's current strength was formidable. A single punch could severely injure a half-step Immortal King; if combined with the chaotic wind, it might even shatter one.

"Get out!" The leader of Feishen Sect roared, his fists radiating divine laws. They clashed with Luo Tian's fist.

"Boom..." A dull sound echoed as the Feishen Sect leader was sent flying, his right arm's robe torn, and his entire arm riddled with cracks.

Luo Tian sent Feishen Sect's leader flying, but the other three attacks descended. A golden hand, massive and scaled, came from above to crush Luo Tian—this was the leader of Jiling Sect. The golden hand, a manifestation of the sect master's power, was magnified dozens of times.

"Zing..." A long sword hummed as purple energy slashed toward Luo Tian. The leader of Ziyang Sect, Tian Yong, had launched his attack.

On the other side, the leader of Tianhong Sect wielded a long spear, pressing down. Three attacks, each radiating overwhelming power, surrounded Luo Tian's escape routes.

"Finished... there's no way to dodge; he'll definitely face two attacks!" People gasped, watching Luo Tian immediately ensnared in peril.

"This kid wouldn't gamble without confidence, right?" Ye Tian narrowed his eyes. Though he hadn't yet reached Immortal King status, he was close. He felt a threat from Luo Tian's presence, especially his Heaven-Emperor's Art, which had given him much insight. He'd been stuck on the boundary of domain for a long time.

"Zing..." As people marveled, Luo Tian suddenly turned, grabbing the descending spear with one hand while punching skyward with the other, his chaotic wind technique unleashed. As for Tian Yong's sword, Luo Tian ignored it, allowing the purple blade to pierce him.

"Boom boom..." Two resounding explosions. The golden hand of Jiling Sect's leader shattered, splattering blood across the sky.

Luo Tian's other hand clamped onto the golden spear, seizing it with brute force.

"Die!" Tian Yong roared, surprised Luo Tian had ignored his attack. His eyes gleamed with joy.

"Poof..." But the next moment, everyone was stunned.

"What's going on!" Ye Liangchen shouted, his gaze filled with disbelief. In his view, the purple sword had pierced Luo Tian's body.

"Glory!" The disciples and elders of the four sects shouted, having witnessed this scene.

Wind and sand swirled; Luo Tian and the four seemed frozen. Luo Tian remained standing.

"Impossible... even if he couldn't beat four, it shouldn't have been like this!" Ye Liangchen frowned slightly.

"It's not as it seems," Ye Tian's eyes flashed with brilliance, admiration evident in his voice.

"It's not injured. Uncle Tian has trapped the sword..." Ye Liangchen, upon hearing Ye Tian's words, scrutinized closely and slapped his thigh, shouting.

"Is this possible?" As Ye Liangchen's words echoed, people turned their gaze to Luo Tian's armpit. Due to the sandstorm, they hadn't seen clearly before. Now, with Ye Liangchen's call, they saw it.

Tian Yong and the others' eyes also showed disbelief. Tian Yong tried to pull out his sword but couldn't.

While Luo Tian and the four were frozen, the leader of Feishen Sect, who had been sent flying by Luo Tian's punch, rushed forward with a long sword, slashing toward Luo Tian.

"Go!" Luo Tian chuckled, kicking Tian Yong in the abdomen. The kick nearly killed him; Tian Yong released his sword and flew backward.

"Only you two remain!" Luo Tian gripped the spear with one hand, rotating it powerfully. The leader of Tianhong Sect was lifted and swung toward the Feishen Sect's sword.

"Dead!" The leader of Tianhong Sect's face darkened. Facing Luo Tian's immense strength, he struggled but couldn't resist.

The Feishen Sect leader's face changed; he quickly retracted his sword. The blade's aura swept across the Tianhong Sect leader's body, making his face pale instantly. If that blade had struck him, he would have died or been severely wounded.

"Zing..." Taking advantage of the moment, Luo Tian pressed his feet into the ground, transforming into a primordial beast and rushing toward Jiling Sect's leader.

"What kind of person is this!" Jiling Sect's leader, his face contorted in panic, watched Luo Tian charging toward him and retreated.

Jiling Sect's leader was fast, but Luo Tian was faster. With the Yellow Spring Step, he stepped into the Yellow Spring and instantly appeared before the retreating Jiling Sect leader.

"Roar!" Jiling Sect's leader roared, his body expanding to hundreds of zhang. He launched a punch toward Luo Tian.

"No use. I've had enough fun; it's time to end this!" Luo Tian sneered, watching the descending fist. Five punches converged with the massive fist and collided.

"Boom boom..." The sky shattered, winds and clouds reversed. Jiling Sect's leader's divine form exploded, his divine laws scattered into the void. The sect master lay battered on the ground.

Luo Tian ignored him, his body twisting as Dragon Abyss Releasing emerged. The black sword descended with overwhelming force toward Tian Yong.

"Ahh..." Tian Yong screamed, watching the black sword descend. His spirit trembled; he tried to escape but found himself ensnared by an invisible force, a powerful pressure like a giant hand gripping him.

"Poof..." Blood splattered. Tian Yong raised his hands to resist, but even Luo Tian's flesh couldn't withstand Dragon Abyss' sharpness. How could Tian Yong resist? He was split in two by Dragon Abyss.

"Dead..." Everyone's mouths twitched as they watched Tian Yong, split in two and killed by Dragon Abyss.

"The second sect master was also slain..." Ziyang Sect's people trembled, gazing at Luo Tian as if he were a plague.

The remaining three sect masters shuddered. Luo Tian's strength exceeded their expectations; even they couldn't subdue him, and he had already killed one.

"How many sect masters have been slain..."

"Previously they called him the Holy Son Killer, now he can be renamed Sect Master Killer," Ye Liangchen said with admiration, watching Luo Tian. He had heard from Nan Gong Yuqing before about Luo Tian's deeds in the Nine Realms.

"Kill..." Luo Tian sneered, leaping into the air toward the leader of Tianhong Sect. The sect master's heart froze, losing all will to fight; he turned and fled.

"We surrender! Let's go!" The leaders of Jiling Sect and Feishen Sect shouted, taking the opportunity to flee toward the distance. Their disciples scattered as well.

"Where do you think you're going!" Luo Tian roared, chasing the leader of Tianhong Sect. With a single sword stroke, he ended the sect master's life.

"Earthly dogs..." People thought of this term as they watched Luo Tian return with a smile.

At that moment, the other sects had already retreated outside Sha Hai City; only Xinghe Mansion and Sha Hai City's local forces remained.

"So strong... besides Immortal Kings, no one can match Luo Tian!" The clan leaders of the Three Great Families stared in awe.

Luo Tian had previously slain Zhao Chengfeng, proving his ability to kill a half-step Immortal King. However, Zhao Chengfeng had just entered the rank and his cultivation was unstable, unlike these four sect masters.

"This kid's decent. He knows Feishen Sect and Jiling Sect have Immortal King-level strength!" Ye Tian's face also showed admiration, feeling if he hadn't reached the Immortal King stage, he might not be Luo Tian's match.

Yet Ye Tian's eyes gleamed with excitement; watching Luo Tian's Heaven-Emperor's Art had given him much insight. A sense of breakthrough surged within Ye Tian.

"Let's go..." Luo Tian sheathed Dragon Abyss, addressing the stunned crowd. A large group marched into Sha Hai City.

Luo Tian led Ye Liangchen and others to the Sha Wang Pavilion, his eyes filled with gratitude: "Uncle Ye, Liangchen, thank you for your help this time!"

"A family member, no need to say two words. What's your next plan?" Ye Liangchen patted Luo Tian's shoulder.

"I need to enter the Death Desert to find someone. Therefore, I'll need your help to watch over Sha Hai City; I'm worried those sects won't stop trying to provoke us."

"Uncle Tian, I'll go with you!" Ye Liangchen insisted. The Death Desert was a forbidden land; he'd also heard that the sandstorm had completely covered it, erasing previous routes.

"Uncle Tian, I'll go with you!" Ran Hao spoke loudly. Without Luo Tian and Huo Zhu, he wouldn't have reached this position.

"Don't follow me. I'll go alone this time!" Luo Tian spoke softly, lacking confidence and not wanting to bring others.

Chapter 2357: Re-entering the Death Desert

That day, Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen's group had a small gathering. The next morning, instead of entering the Death Desert, Luo Tian stood with Ye Tian in the courtyard.

"Uncle Ye, please watch over!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his hands continuously forming seals. As he formed them, the momentum of heaven and earth converged toward him and Ye Tian—this was the Heaven-Emperor's Art.

Ye Tian's eyes glowed with divine light, attentively watching Luo Tian's hand seals while absorbing the Heaven-Emperor's Art. Ye Tian hadn't let Luo Tian leave because he wanted to observe the Heaven-Emperor's Art again. He was just one step away from becoming an Immortal King, needing to form his own domain by understanding the momentum of heaven and earth.

The heavens roared as Luo Tian continuously formed the Heaven-Emperor's Art, repeatedly demonstrating it so Ye Tian could see more clearly and understand deeper.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian spent the entire day forming the Heaven-Emperor's Art, refining it further with each iteration. His range expanded from over a hundred zhang to more than two hundred. Ye Tian, immersed in understanding it, said nothing but his eyes glowed brighter, and many of his doubts were resolved through Luo Tian's art.

Night fell. Ye Tian's eyes shone like two stars, his expression filled with admiration: "It's like this!"

"Kid, I owe you a favor!" Ye Tian laughed loudly, the first time he'd shown such an expression.

Ye Sheng's domain was already formed, offering little help to Ye Tian. However, Luo Tian's domain prototype greatly aided him, leaving Ye Tian deeply moved. He was confident that following Luo Tian's method, he could form his own domain after a period of seclusion.

"Uncle Ye, you don't owe me anything. You've helped me enough!" Luo Tian smiled. Ye Wu Dao and Ye Tian had indeed aided him greatly, and Luo Tian was always clear about debts and favors. He was happy to help Ye Tian.

"Are you about to ascend?" Luo Tian asked, observing the momentum around Ye Tian and inquiring with excitement.

"Almost. I'll return to seclusion now. If there's anything, talk to Liangchen!" Ye Tian said, retrieving his identity token and leaving at night with five million Iron Blood Hall disciples. Five million were left under Ye Liangchen's command.

"Hope it works!" Luo Tian muttered, watching the Star Cloud Ship vanish into the sky. His eyes showed anticipation.

"One family with three Immortal Kings!" Luo Tian couldn't help but admire the strength of Xinghe Mansion's Ye family. From Ye Liangchen, he'd heard that Ye Wu Dao had also entered the early stage of Immortal King.

"I need to leave too!" Luo Tian muttered, the next morning. With Ran Hao and Ye Liangchen accompanying him, he purchased essential items for the desert and exited Sha Hai City to enter the Death Desert.

The Death Desert remained as it was, endless and mysterious. Luo Tian transformed into a long rainbow, flying across the desert's sky.

Luo Tian had changed significantly. His half-step Immortal King strength could handle many dangers. The Death Desert's harsh environment had little impact on him, at least initially; he felt only a slight heat and his true energy consumed quickly.

The desert still had many people walking, as the sandstorm had just erupted. The upheaval might have brought treasures, so many entered seeking opportunities. Few flew like Luo Tian; most walked on the ground. When they saw Luo Tian flying, their eyes showed envy.

"A half-step Immortal King! If I were one, I wouldn't have to search here; I'd find a sect to retire in or even enter the Upper Three Heavens!" People sighed.

Luo Tian's speed was extraordinary. After an hour, he finally landed on the ground. The hot sand was scorching.

"This place has no map!" Luo Tian muttered, gazing at the endless desert. He had dared to fly before because of a new map. Now, he was far from Sha Hai City with no one around—only golden sand.

Luo Tian chose a direction and walked into the desert's depths. He took out pills, continuously consuming them. The Death Desert was extremely hot with sparse spiritual energy; he had prepared many recovery pills to avoid being as helpless as before.

Luo Tian walked on, remaining vigilant. The harsh environment was a danger, and the desert's creatures were also deadly; one mistake could cost his life.

"I hope I don't meet those sand scorpions again!" Luo Tian muttered, recalling his previous encounter with the sand scorpions. He felt a chill now; he could only proceed in one direction, or risk getting lost.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian walked through the desert. Night arrived, and a cold atmosphere spread. The Death Desert at night was even more terrifying.

"Master Meng is so picky, choosing to live in the desert!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, blaming Meng Wushuang. He felt lonely walking alone in the desert.

After walking for two hours, Luo Tian stopped. He noticed the ground beneath him was trembling slightly.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian immediately became alert, even drawing Dragon Abyss and scanning the surroundings with his eyes.

"Shua shua shua..." The familiar sound rose from beneath Luo Tian, making his mouth twitch.

"I was wondering why my luck is so good!" Luo Tian muttered inwardly, then leaped into the air.

"Zong..." As Luo Tian took flight, a series of earth-shaking sounds erupted. A stream of light rushed toward him—these were the sand scorpions that had nearly killed Luo Tian and Ran Hao before.

Luo Tian soared upward, his forehead's flame mark blazing. Nine-colored flames engulfed him.

"Zhi zhi..." The sand scorpions collided with the flames, instantly burning to death. The previous seven-color fire had been replaced by nine-color fire; killing these scorpions was no problem.

A layer of sand scorpions emerged from the sand, covering the ground and rushing toward Luo Tian. Their sharp mouths were terrifying.

Luo Tian's eyes glowed with brilliance, watching the sand scorpions charging fearlessly. He was initially startled but quickly realized he could now handle these creatures.

"I'll see how many you have!" Luo Tian smiled, his hands moving as nine-colored flames swept across, mercilessly slaughtering the sand scorpions. The sound of "huala" echoed constantly, with many sand scorpions dying and their venomous liquid falling to the ground, corroding the sand.

"Good stuff!" Luo Tian watched the black venomous liquid, his eyes gleaming. He moved his hands, activating the Heaven-Emperor's Art to cover two hundred zhang around him. The venomous liquid converged toward Luo Tian, whom he continuously collected.

Around Luo Tian's two hundred zhang radius, it became a death trap for sand scorpions. Yet the scorpions showed no fear, continuously attacking.

"Three hundred... four hundred..." Each drop of venom was collected by Luo Tian. He had no intention of leaving.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian collected over two hundred vials of venom, feeling the strength of the venom shocked him.

"Shua shua..." Finally, the sand scorpions realized they couldn't withstand the flames. Their numbers thinned, and they began to scatter.

"Come on! Don't leave!" Luo Tian laughed loudly, actively chasing the sand scorpion swarm. In his view, these were deadly toxins; if used properly, they'd be a major weapon.

One vial of venom was bad enough. If it were a whole vial, even Luo Tian would find it challenging. As he chased them, an astonishing scene appeared: a person standing in a two-hundred-zhang radius of flames, chasing a massive sand scorpion swarm across the Death Desert.

If someone saw this, they'd be stunned. This was only possible for Luo Tian; others at the half-step Immortal King level would likely be dead. Who else could possess nine-colored flames in the entire spiritual world?

Luo Tian continued chasing the sand scorpion swarm, joyfully collecting venom. He didn't know where to go.

One night passed. The sky turned white, and the scorpions scattered everywhere, finally being chased to extinction.

"Two hundred thirty vials. If I refine this venom, could it kill an Immortal King?" Luo Tian's face showed excitement as he muttered in his mind, looking at the two hundred vials in his storage ring.

"Ugh..." As Luo Tian was excited, his forehead's flame mark flickered. Xiaqi began communicating with him.

"Did you sense the location of Master Huo?" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with joy. After chasing all night, he was already somewhat lost but remembered his path.

Xiaqi's message made Luo Tian overjoyed. First, it confirmed Master Huo was alive; if he wasn't dead, then Gu Qianxue wouldn't be in trouble either.

"Where?" Luo Tian excitedly asked, having Xiaqi point the direction. He rushed forward, leaving a trail of dust.

Luo Tian kept running without rest, eating pills several times. Finally, he reached the location Xiaqi indicated.

Golden light flowed continuously, a golden tower standing in the golden desert, radiating an aura of vapor.

"What is this?" Luo Tian stared at the golden tower, his eyes filled with shock. He felt the tower's immense power, especially the golden pearl at its top, which gave him a powerful pressure.

Chapter 2358: The Tower of Illuminating Heaven

"What is this thing? Master Huo is here?" Luo Tian stared at the golden tower, his forehead's flame mark pulsing. His eyes were full of shock; he felt even with his current strength, he couldn't withstand the tower's might. Even an early-stage Immortal King could be crushed by it.

"What is this pearl?" He then noticed the golden pearl at the tower's top, radiating brilliant gold light. The light was so dazzling it could make anything vanish beneath it.

"Never mind, first enhance my methods!" Luo Tian muttered. Xiaqi wouldn't deceive him; if he felt Master Huo was in this tower, there was an 80% chance he was here.

But the tower gave Luo Tian a sense of danger. Though it seemed legitimate, he felt an evil aura—otherwise, why would Meng Wushuang be trapped here?

Luo Tian organized his storage ring, taking out the two hundred vials of sand scorpion venom. His hands moved rapidly, and the vials flew out, gathering before him.

"Roar..." Black venomous liquid emitted a powerful fluctuation, like a thousand sand scorpions roaring.

Luo Tian waved his hand, and one hundred and eight silver needles flew from his hands. This was the method he thought of—melting the venom into the silver needles, making them a major weapon.

Silver needles were his usual technique and hard to detect. When transformed into venomous needles, they would definitely wound the enemy upon contact.

He acted immediately. Luo Tian started his actions, using his spiritual sense to drive the one hundred and eight silver needles into the venom.

"Zhi..." Nine-colored flames enveloped the venom, beginning to refine it.

"Ahh... I'm lucky I learned two days of refining from Master Lu Chong! Learning a craft is really important!" Luo Tian sighed, sitting cross-legged to maintain the flames with his cultivation. The venom was originally refined by nine-colored flames, now needing refinement—this was no small task and the process was slow.

However, Luo Tian could clearly feel the venom gradually decreasing, being refined to its peak and merging with the tiny silver needles. At this point, the needles were no longer just silver; they had turned black, radiating a dark divine aura.

Time passed slowly. Three days went by. The refinement process had greatly drained Luo Tian's cultivation and spiritual sense, with him eating a pill once to recover.

Yet the results of these three days were very encouraging. Now, nine-colored flames hovered above Luo Tian's head, only the size of a fist.

Even through the flames, the black venom gave Luo Tian a cold feeling, making him even more excited.

Another day passed. The nine-colored flames suddenly collapsed, and one hundred and eight streams of light hovered above Luo Tian's head. The black silver needles radiated an幽芒, making the air around Luo Tian freeze.

"Good stuff!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with excitement. He reached out, and the one hundred and eight silver needles hovered in his hand. He dared not touch them with his flesh.

"I don't believe I can miss one!" Luo Tian eagerly stored the needles.

These three days, he also tried to refine Dragon Abyss and Mo Ming Sword with venom but was immediately rejected by the two deadly swords. He found it amusing; even Lie Tian Gun was like this.

"Never mind, I'll go in and check!" Luo Tian sighed longingly. He didn't know the needles' power, but he knew even he couldn't withstand them without dying or losing a layer of skin.

Luo Tian stepped toward the golden tower, gazing at its golden door. Finally, he bit his teeth and forced it open slightly, entering.

As Luo Tian stepped through the door's entrance, a terrifying momentum pressed upon him. He couldn't resist it, his face instantly darkening; his entire body was uncontrollably suppressed.

"Dead... this motherf***er got me killed!" Luo Tian's heart trembled. This momentum was stronger than any he had encountered before, making him feel desperate.

In an instant, Luo Tian wanted to retreat but was too late. He thought he was doomed.

However, soon after, his feet felt empty; they didn't touch the ground. This made Luo Tian's body fall down.

The surroundings were dark, and he didn't know where he had fallen. He was relieved that the suppressing momentum gradually lessened, though it remained strong.

After some time, Luo Tian finally landed. His legs slightly bent as he steadied himself. As he touched the ground, his eyes brightened.

"Boom..." Dust swirled; a sandy world returned to the Death Desert, making Luo Tian frown slightly.

"Welcome to the Tower of Illuminating Heaven. Completing the trial makes you my master. Good luck!" As Luo Tian was puzzled, a solemn voice echoed through the world, shaking his spirit.

"Kid, this tower must be obtained. Once you obtain it, I can recover three-tenths of my strength!" The voice of Pangu Stone echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Do you know the origin of this tower?" Luo Tian asked, surprised Pangu Stone knew everything.

"I don't know. But I do know this tower contains a fragment of world power, meaning it might have been a world treasure or an unfinished one!" Pangu Stone transmitted to Luo Tian, his voice filled with excitement.

"Who said only the world heart can evolve into a world treasure?" Luo Tian was confused, not understanding why Pangu Stone said this.

"Rubbish! Who told you only the world heart can evolve into a world treasure? Once your strength reaches earth-shaking and heaven-weeping levels, you can refine a world treasure!" Pangu Stone roared.

"Ah! I see now!" Luo Tian nodded. He had heard this from Jiang Yuzhe before.

"So this tower is truly precious!" Luo Tian muttered, but he wasn't very happy. This tower was too complicated; even Meng Wushuang, an early-stage Immortal King, had been trapped here.

"I'll go ahead and scout for you! You stay and accept the trial!" Pangu Stone transmitted.

"Don't forget to find my wife and elders for me!" Luo Tian quickly spoke, feeling uneasy. With Pangu Stone's presence, he had an additional life-saving method.

"Leave it to me!" Pangu Stone replied and disappeared, leaving Luo Tian alone in this sandy world.

"Alas..." Luo Tian sighed longingly, waiting for Pangu Stone to return.

"The first trial begins!" As Luo Tian was about to wait for Pangu Stone, a cold voice echoed through the world, making his body tremble slightly.

"Rustle... rustle..." Sand waves surged, golden sand gathering before Luo Tian to form a golden centipede. Its massive body moved across the sand, rushing toward Luo Tian with its golden tail hook.

"Is this a trial?" Luo Tian looked at the massive centipede. Though it appeared terrifying, its strength wasn't enough to warrant Luo Tian's attention. He was confident one punch could kill it.

"Probably not that simple!" Luo Tian didn't act rashly, recalling his past lesson. Once in the Cemetery King's Palace, he had encountered sand soldiers made of sand. Though he shattered them, they could regroup.

Luo Tian's body flickered and vanished from the spot. The golden tail hook pierced into the sand, and the centipede pulled it out again, rushing toward Luo Tian.

...As Luo Tian just entered the Tower of Illuminating Heaven, several haggard figures also appeared outside the tower. Their eyes were filled with excitement.

However, these people's appearances differed from ordinary people; they wore wide robes that obscured their bodies. They had no hair, with shaved heads and monastic marks—monk-like appearances. The leader was a fat monk with twelve monastic marks, his big head and ears.

"Found it! Finally found it!" The fat monk with small eyes looked at the golden Tower of Illuminating Heaven, his expression filled with awe.

"This is the Tower of Illuminating Heaven I once subdued to imprison demons and spirits. It must have a relic at the top!"

"Once it was a trial site for my sect's disciples, but no one has ever reached the top. No one knows how many levels this tower actually has," the fat monk sighed softly.

"Go!" The elder monk spoke, and almost instantly, several monks rushed into the Tower of Illuminating Heaven.

"Boom..." Luo Tian smashed the sand-formed centipede before him, watching the surrounding scene to see what would happen. He had evaded it for a while but found no changes, so he smashed it.

The golden centipede shattered into rolling sand hills that piled before Luo Tian. A golden pill hovered there.

"What is this?" Luo Tian took the pill, recognizing it as a five-star elixir that could enhance True Immortal stage cultivation.

"This is the reward for this trial?" Luo Tian held the pill, his eyes showing understanding. He observed the surrounding scene's changes.

"The centipede was difficult to fight at the True Immortal stage, but this elixir is for True Immortal stage disciples. Its effect must be much better!" Luo Tian muttered, now standing on a mountain peak.

"Zing..." As Luo Tian just steadied himself, his head became dark clouds with lightning snakes moving within. The overwhelming pressure made the world change colors.

"What is this..." Luo Tian looked at the black clouds, a bad feeling suddenly rising in his heart.

Chapter 2359: Trapped

"Impossible..." Luo Tian's spirit trembled. The oppressive atmosphere spread across the world, thunder roared and descended like a water bucket-sized lightning dragon toward Luo Tian.

"Damn!" Luo Tian's face darkened. Though his flesh wasn't afraid of lightning, this was about his dantian.

"How fast!" Luo Tian muttered, surprised how quickly he had reached the lightning trial. He had already passed one lightning trial on the Mirage Sea.

"Wait, it's not time yet!" He suddenly remembered. It had been just over two months since his last lightning trial on the Mirage Sea; it couldn't be a lightning trial.

"Could it be this tower's trial?"

"Yes, the thunder seems strong but only kills True Immortal stage disciples. For me, it doesn't cause much harm!" Luo Tian muttered, understanding.

"But it's different for people. I'm afraid of lightning trials now!" Luo Tian cursed his bad luck inwardly, but the lightning was shattered by a punch. Electricity flowed over Luo Tian's body, entering his dantian.

"Shiver..." Luo Tian inhaled sharply. His dantian churned with dark qi, and the golden lightning struck his demon altar, refining it with lightning power.

Before Luo Tian could react, another golden lightning descended, making his mouth twitch. He had no time to think; he activated the Mind Demon's Scripture to stabilize his demon altar, preventing it from collapsing under lightning.

"One... two..." Nine lightning strikes descended in succession. Luo Tian's body trembled violently, his face pale and spitting blood, collapsing to the ground. He was severely wounded again.

His dantian now had cracks; black qi even spilled from his body. The demon altar hovered in the dantian, continuously absorbing the scattered qi from the lightning.

Time passed slowly. The cracks on the demon altar disappeared, and it expanded by an inch in size.

"Almost there again... this life is unbearable!" Luo Tian muttered, feeling his dantian's demon altar stabilized. He thought of the danger he had just faced.

"Each time feels like hell!" Luo Tian slowly stood up, though dangerous, his strength had improved slightly.

"Zing..." A golden elixir fell from the sky onto Luo Tian's front, still a five-star elixir. It was better than before.

"Such a stingy person! I almost died!" Luo Tian couldn't help but shout. He had nearly lost his life, yet received only one five-star elixir.

But no one responded to Luo Tian's shouting. He could only grumpily accept the elixir, watching the scene change.

The view shifted again. The world roared as a golden drum appeared before Luo Tian, radiating overwhelming power.

"Smash this drum to pass..." Luo Tian looked at the golden drum, frowning slightly. He felt the drum's surface was solid and resilient; even a half-step Immortal King couldn't break it.

"Zing..." As he spoke, Luo Tian clenched his fist and punched the golden drum.
