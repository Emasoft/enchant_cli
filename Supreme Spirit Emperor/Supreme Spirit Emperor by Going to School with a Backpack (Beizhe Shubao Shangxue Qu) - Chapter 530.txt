Though his face bore exhaustion, every survivor of the Eighth Army wore an expression of exhilaration.

For the past month, their combat merits had surged dramatically, far surpassing those achieved when they followed other armies to hunt ghostly creatures.

"Ha! I'm definitely exchanging for a mid-grade immortal artifact this time!"

"I can finally afford that sixth-tier elixir too!" Their eyes gleamed with fervor as they stepped into the military compound.

"Boom..." But as they entered, a thunderous explosion echoed through the courtyard, causing everyone's faces to pale.

"Did I hear that right? That sound..."

"It's the blast furnace—what Lo Tian created earlier. How dare he do this again!" Murmurs rippled through the crowd before fear gripped them. They leapt into the air, fleeing as memories of that earth-shattering explosion from days prior lingered.

"Reckless!" Ke Duanshan's eyes narrowed as he soared into the sky, his hand grasping the twisting black pillar. With a snap, it disintegrated.

Xue Mian's eyes flickered with tension. He clutched his white sword, understanding Ke Duanshan's nature. If there was no mistake, Lo Tian and Ye Liangchen were in trouble unless Lo Tian had a compelling reason.

"Little Tian isn't that foolish," another masked youth muttered, his posture taut with concern.

"Lo Tian, you'd better give me a reason not to kill you today," Ke Duanshan barked, his voice laced with fury.

"Welcome back, Commander!" As Ke Duanshan's words faded, Lo Tian and Ye Liangchen scrambled to their feet, shouting.

"Commander, we're ashamed! While our brothers fought for survival outside, we remained here, unable to join the battle!"

"We curse ourselves for not fighting alongside you in blood and sweat!"

"So, I and Tian prepared a welcome ceremony. No fireworks—just a little explosion to celebrate!" Ye Liangchen declared, his tone mock-serious.

"..." The Eighth Army stared at Ye Liangchen as if he were a deity, stunned by his audacity to twist truth into fiction.

Lo Tian beside him sighed in admiration. Ye Liangchen's shameless spirit reminded him of only two people—Sun Kenuan and Zheng Xin. Even Diao Dezhu fell short of Ye Liangchen's audacity.

"Not enough!" Ke Duanshan coldly intoned, silencing the faint smiles.

"Ah, Commander, we were refining Ghost-Repelling Elixirs! A furnace explosion is natural!" Ye Liangchen interjected, his eyes alight with excitement at their recent gains.

"Not enough!" Ke Duanshan's gaze remained icy as he fixed Ye Liangchen and Lo Tian.

"Crash...!" This time, Ye Liangchen stayed silent. Lo Tian acted immediately, sensing Ke Duanshan's growing killing intent.

With a wave of his hand, black elixirs erupted from Lo Tian's palm, forming a river of darkness. A chilling aura enveloped the crowd.

Each glossy elixir seemed to roar like a vengeful ghost, swirling around Lo Tian.

"Eight hundred..." The crowd gaped at the perfect elixirs, their eyes wide with awe.

"Are these really Ghost-Repelling Elixirs?" Their disbelief echoed, even Ke Duanshan and the major officers' faces shifted.

"Your efforts have not been in vain, Commander," Lo Tian proclaimed proudly, including Ke Duanshan in his triumph. "Ye Liangchen and I have finally mastered mass production of Ghost-Repelling Elixirs!"

"By the gods, how could Lo Tian craft eight hundred elixirs in so short a time? How long would it take a cultivator to make eight hundred of these?" The crowd was stunned.

"Excellent. You've lived up to my expectations!" Ke Duanshan's face softened, a rare smile gracing his lips. He marveled at Lo Tian's talent—this was unprecedented in his experience.

"How many can you produce daily?" Ke Duanshan's sharp gaze met Lo Tian's. The sheer number of elixirs could fetch countless combat merits.

"Recently, I tested my limit—two hundred daily, and that's pushing it," Lo Tian replied honestly. He now understood the value of appearing extraordinary in Bountiful Heaven City.

"Two hundred!" Ke Duanshan's expression brightened slightly. Though modest, two hundred elixirs were a terrifying number for anyone.

"Merits are just numbers! At five million merits per elixir, Lo Cultivator earns ten million daily..." The crowd hesitated to calculate further.

"Dammit, I've worked my ass off for a month and still can't match what Lo Tian earns in an hour!" The crowd groaned, feeling the injustice.

"Brothers, you know how effective these elixirs are! Eight million merits each—line up if you want one!" Lo Tian called out.

"I'll take one!" Ye Chen was the first to speak, having ascended to the True Immortal realm by refining Lo Tian's elixirs. His current state mirrored that day, and if he purified the residual ghost qi, he'd likely break into True Immortal.

"So will I!" After Ye Chen spoke, Qin He Feng and others followed, their situations similar.

True Immortals required fewer elixirs to refine, as True Immortal energy was superior. The crowd's murmurs faded as they exchanged elixirs, and within half an hour, Lo Tian's stock vanished, converting into six hundred forty million merits.

"Ah, Lo Cultivator, next time you refine, be sure to find me!" Many sighed wistfully, approaching Lo Tian.

The Eighth Army and elite Black Armor Corps totaled 1.1 million soldiers, with nearly 800,000 True Immortals. Not all needed elixirs, but the base was massive. After this relief rotation, almost everyone had absorbed ghost qi, with tens of thousands eager to exchange elixirs. Thus, Lo Tian's elixirs were never in short supply.

"Come on, I'll take you all out to celebrate! Time to upgrade your gear!" Lo Tian laughed, his newfound wealth evident.

With Ye Liangchen included, a hundred people strode confidently toward the Treasure Refining Hall, their arrogance drawing envious glances.

Among them were twenty or so faces etched with regret—those who had failed to rescue Lo Tian and Ye Liangchen when they were surrounded by ghostly creatures.

Ye Liangchen led the group, his arrogance palpable as they approached a grand hall.

Inside, people bustled about. Seeing Lo Tian's group, the crowd was surprised; rarely did so many enter the Treasure Refining Hall.

Yet when they noticed Lo Tian's group reached only half-step True Immortal, their eyes flashed with disdain.

"None even qualify as True Immortals. What's the point of this show? They're obviously broke!" The crowd whispered, assuming True Immortals had minimal merits.

Indeed, a True Immortal's merits after one relief rotation rarely exceeded three to five million—still commendable.

"Probably they're pooling merits to buy a high-tier formation!" The crowd reasoned, understanding their purpose. Yet curiosity lingered; no one had ever bought a hundred-person formation before.

Lo Tian's group scanned the hall's categorized list—weapons, talismans, elixirs—all names densely filling his vision.

"Bountiful Heaven Sword—treasure of Bountiful Heaven Mountain, only 100 in existence. A hundred Bountiful Heaven Swords can form the Bountiful Heaven Sword Array, capable of slaying a True Immortal Lord in his prime!" Lo Tian's eyes widened with admiration.

"This Bountiful Heaven Sword is exceptional, but too expensive—each costs a hundred million merits. Acquiring all 100 is impossible. This must be Bountiful Heaven Mountain's premium item," Lo Tian muttered.

"God-Hunting Arrows! I'll take them!" After scanning the list, Lo Tian pointed at a soldier.

He'd visited the Treasure Refining Hall before, eyeing these arrows but lacking merits. Now, his situation had changed.

"God-Hunting Arrows—each arrow feather is a mid-grade immortal artifact?" The crowd's faces shifted.

"Twenty-five million merits!" The soldier replied, his gaze flickering toward Lo Tian.

Chapter 2031: Shocking Bountiful Heaven City

Outside the Treasure Refining Hall, a hundred people stood proudly, their bodies fully equipped. In one day, they'd exchanged items.

Each now carried a mid-grade immortal artifact; other gear was entirely renewed, surpassing even elite troops. Their armaments rivaled the Eighth Army's best.

Six hundred forty million merits vanished, leaving the crowd in awe as they headed toward the Eighth Army.

"How did these True Immortals amass so many merits? Six hundred million is terrifying!" Everyone's faces bore disbelief, watching Lo Tian's group depart.

"Ha! This feels amazing—see their expressions!" Ye Liangchen grinned, clutching a golden longsword. His waist was adorned with various pendants—none ordinary—as he led the group.

"Refining, exchanging merits, acquiring supplies!" Lo Tian's eyes gleamed. He felt his arrival in Bountiful Heaven City was wise; these were external tools, but accumulated over time, they became powerful. Like when Ye Liangchen had self-detonated six mid-grade immortal artifacts, wounding Zhou Cang and others.

As they returned to the Eighth Army's compound, news of Lo Tian's six hundred forty million merits spread across Bountiful Heaven City.

Six hundred million merits was no small sum. Only major officers could afford it.

Lo Tian's name spread instantly, shaking Bountiful Heaven City.

"How could a half-step True Immortal have so many merits? It's cheating!"

"Absolutely, it's cheating!"

"I heard Lo Tian was confined and never hunted ghostly creatures. How could he have so many merits?" Everyone doubted, even alarming major army commanders and the deputy city lord.

Yet the major commanders and deputy lord confirmed Lo Tian hadn't cheated, earning merits solely through his strength.

As time passed, details of Lo Tian's merit acquisition spread.

"Mass-producing Ghost-Repelling Elixirs, with superior effects—eight million merits each, converting accumulated ghost qi into cultivation!" As Lo Tian's story spread, people were stunned.

Lo Tian hadn't anticipated his high-profile visit to the Treasure Refining Hall would have such an effect.

Yet the Eighth Army fiercely protected Lo Tian, as not all had received elixirs. Thus, no other army could purchase them.

Each day only two hundred elixirs were produced, snatched by the Eighth Army immediately. The terrifying merits flowed into Lo Tian's wrist device.

Even once, when he wanted to venture outside Bountiful Heaven City to hone his skills, the Eighth Army blocked him.

As Ghost-Repelling Elixirs kept flowing, the Eighth Army saw daily breakthroughs. Thunderous roars echoed as people broke through barriers, earning柯断山's intense respect for Lo Tian.

As the Eighth Army's strength rose, other armies grew more horrified, their own frenzy intensifying.

"Commander, these Ghost-Repelling Elixirs are too effective! We're all Bountiful Heaven soldiers. Let's not let the Eighth Army monopolize them!" Almost every army urged their commanders.

Some armies had cultivators capable of refining Ghost-Repelling Elixirs. After research, they understood why Lo Tian could produce elixirs that converted ghost qi into cultivation—marveling yet bitter.

Though they knew the method, they couldn't mass-produce like Lo Tian, their speed lagging by ten thousand miles.

Time passed. Two months had elapsed, the period柯断山 mentioned. During these two months, Lo Tian had refined Ghost-Repelling Elixirs daily.

While amassing massive merits, he noticed his Ghost-Controlling Seal had advanced to the middle stage. Now, even True Immortal beginners would submit to him.

Not because he cultivated fast, but Bountiful Heaven City was ideal for Ghost-Controlling Seal. Elsewhere, he needed an hour nightly; here, he could train all day.

Refining Ghost-Repelling Elixirs also honed his Ghost-Controlling Seal—two goals achieved.

"Ugh..." Lo Tian exhaled deeply, handing an elixir to Ye Liangchen. A smile graced his face.

"Nine hundred and sixty million merits!" Lo Tian stared at the staggering number on his wrist, his heart clenching. These merits surpassed even the nine major army commanders—nearly matching a commander's level.

"By the gods!" Ye Liangchen stood beside Lo Tian, staring at the number, his eyes glowing.

"Liangchen, take Haozhen and others to the Treasure Refining Hall for more gear!" Lo Tian ordered.

Lo Tian sensed Bountiful Heaven City wouldn't allow him to gain merits this way indefinitely. Soon, the Treasure Refining Hall might be emptied.

"Got it!" Ye Liangchen laughed, seizing this chance to show off. He waved his hand, leading Haozhen's group.

Lo Tian's gaze held anticipation—how many items could nine hundred and sixty million merits buy?

Three days passed. Lo Tian feigned exhaustion, ceasing elixir refinement. During these three days, an event shook Bountiful Heaven City.

"Eighth Army Ye Liangchen exchanged ten high-grade immortal artifacts, spending four hundred and seventy million merits!"

"Eighth Army Ye Liangchen exchanged five hundred mid-grade immortal artifacts, spending two hundred and fifty million merits!"

"Eighth Army Ye Liangchen exchanged talismans... seventh-tier elixirs..." A series of authoritative voices echoed through Bountiful Heaven City, laced with resignation.

Bountiful Heaven City's rules required declaring if one spent over a hundred million merits, informing all soldiers to inspire them. Yet this time, the elderly announcer wore a faint smile.

He sat there, watching Ye Liangchen gleefully, his body radiant with gold.

Three days prior, Ye Liangchen had led a hundred people to the Treasure Refining Hall, exchanging supplies relentlessly.

In three days, the hall's stock dropped nearly ten percent—though minor, its value was immeasurable.

Though the hall had many treasures, it couldn't withstand such exchanges. These items were accumulated over years, constantly consumed while Bountiful Heaven Mountain replenished them—maintaining a balance.

Yet Ye Liangchen's exchange shattered this equilibrium. No one in Bountiful Heaven City's history had done so before.

"What!" The authoritative voice lingered, leaving the city in uproar.

"Ten high-grade immortal artifacts—Bountiful Heaven Hall has only thirty-something! He took a third!"

"Mid-grade immortal artifacts—most were exchanged too!"

"High-tier talismans, nearly swept; mid-tier talismans vanished. My god! Is he starting a sect? Even the top three sects, like the One-Heaven Bai Clan, don't have ten high-grade immortal artifacts!" The city's people erupted in disbelief.

"Damn it! We should've known Lo Tian's Ghost-Repelling Elixirs would reach this!" The major army commanders' faces turned grim, including柯断山's.

Everyone knew Ye Liangchen and Lo Tian were in cahoots, with Lo Tian the one mass-producing Ghost-Repelling Elixirs.

"This kid's causing a stir!"柯断山's lips twitched, stunned by Lo Tian's actions—exchanging nearly a billion merits.

"But it's within the rules. No one can object!"柯断山's eyes gleamed with determination.

"I'm done! We toil endlessly, yet he just refines for two months!" The entire Bountiful Heaven City, except combat zone soldiers, roared.

The incident spread like wildfire, inciting everyone's resentment. Yet no one dared speak out—Lo Tian earned it through his skills. No one had anticipated anyone could mass-produce Ghost-Repelling Elixirs.

"In the palace of Xue Mian, three figures sat, faces blank."

A white-haired man, once a middle-aged man, now appeared older.

"I'd want to acknowledge him! By the gods, nearly a billion merits! I've been in Bountiful Heaven City for years and earned only two million. My senior earned over a hundred million, but it took relentless killing of a half-step True Immortal!" Thunderous voices echoed as the robust youth shouted.

"Stay calm," the white-haired man chuckled, eyes proud. "This time he exploited a loophole. Bountiful Heaven City will surely find a way to curb him, else the Treasure Refining Hall might be emptied!"

Lo Tian sat in his courtyard, waiting for Ye Liangchen's return. His heart was uneasy, fearing angering the Bountiful Heaven City Lord and being crushed.

Ye Liangchen didn't arrive, but柯断山 did—smiling.

Chapter 2033: Calculations

Bountiful Heaven City, these days everyone discussed Lo Tian. A six hundred forty million merit exchange had already stunned them.

But this wasn't over. Who could imagine, after two months, another nine hundred and sixty million merit exchange? Combined, it exceeded a billion.

Since Bountiful Heaven City's founding, no one had done this before. Lo Tian's record would be etched in history.

People were even more stunned when Bountiful Heaven City compromised, altering Ghost-Repelling Elixir merits to curb Lo Tian.

"Boom...!"

Outside the Eighth Army, hundreds of furious figures charged toward it.

These hundreds rushed recklessly, ignoring all caution as they stormed Lo Tian's courtyard.

"Big Brother, these people are really despicable! They're cutting off our profit!" Ye Liangchen's eyes burned with anger, recalling recent events.

"But we've profited. With these supplies, our strength should rise!" Lo Tian shrugged nonchalantly.

Ghost-Repelling Elixir price dropped to a hundred merits, still convertible into merits for Lo Tian. Yet compared to the previous eight million per elixir, it was a ten thousand mile gap. Lo Tian wouldn't lower the price.

Bountiful Heaven City could afford it, but he couldn't. Clearly, Jiang Chen and others exploited this weakness.

The final blow was those claiming to have issues from Lo Tian's elixirs, deterring people from buying.

Words were powerless; even if Lo Tian explained, no one would believe him.

"Go! All of you go into seclusion. I hope you all improve after emerging!" Lo Tian smiled, gazing at Huozhen and others.

"Yes!" They nodded, bowing to Lo Tian, eyes alight with excitement. Lo Tian's arrival saved them years of struggle.

"Lo Tian, come out and die! How dare you cheat us!" As Huozhen prepared to leave, roars echoed outside.

Figures thundered in, eyes burning with fury, glares sharp as blades. Especially Zhou Cang and Jiang Xuan, their killing intent surged.

"Reckless! This is not your place to cause chaos!" Huozhen barked, blocking the gate.

"Selling fake medicine! Using poisoned elixirs as Ghost-Repelling Elixirs! Today, you either return our merits or we kill you. We'll report to the Commander and even the City Lord!" They roared.

"Dammit, you're blaming me for Ye Liangchen's problems!" Hearing their curses, Ye Liangchen jumped up, confronting the hundreds.

Chaos erupted—100 inside, 500 outside, exchanging curses. Lo Tian stood in the courtyard, gazing at those clashing with Ye Liangchen.

Soon, Lo Tian noticed something was off. Some were just stirring up trouble; others bore genuine killing intent—instinctual, laced with greed.

"Why do these people want to kill me? We don't know each other!" Lo Tian pondered.

"Those with hostility toward me are Zhou Cang and others, plus those secretly clinging to the Ghost Valley's hope. And City Lord Jiang Chen!"

"Jiang Chen might arrange this, but the others wouldn't be so foolish. Perhaps someone will trouble me, but I didn't expect this many. This must be orchestrated by someone, with Jiang Chen's tacit approval. Otherwise, the eight army commanders would have arrived!"

"Zhou Cang's group lacks such power. The hidden ones couldn't gather so many!"

"No, there's also Hell!" Lo Tian's thoughts crystallized.

His reasoning stemmed from his attitude toward these people.

Zhou Cang's group could insult him; Jiang Chen's tacit approval meant defeating them. As for Hell's spies, they needed to be ruthlessly eliminated!

"Ah, they're using me as bait to fish out Hell's spies!" Lo Tian suddenly understood Jiang Chen's plan.

Hell and Bountiful Heaven City fought, both sides harboring spies deeply embedded. Without special incidents, they'd remain hidden forever—only exposed during specific missions.

Lo Tian's chaos was the moment these spies revealed themselves, as he was on Hell's kill list. Killing him in chaos would earn heavy rewards—worth the risk.

Plus, killing him in chaos left no room for complaints. This was Jiang Chen's tacit approval.

Lo Tian quickly grasped the situation, his gaze filled with admiration. He mused: "If this was Jiang Chen's calculation, he's terrifying!"

"Assuming this is a setup, I've been calculated since entering the hall. But why are they so certain I'll resist instead of surrendering the elixirs?" Lo Tian was puzzled but stopped thinking.

"If they want to use me, one round of being used isn't a big deal. Let others see I'm not easy to provoke. Killing is nothing new for me!" Lo Tian muttered, then stepped forward toward the hundreds clashing with Ye Liangchen.

"Buzz..." Lo Tian's speed reached its peak, instantly appearing before a youth. A fist descended.

This youth was a True Immortal peak soldier, stronger than external ones. Yet against Lo Tian, he was nothing.

The youth couldn't react, pondering how to kill Lo Tian in chaos. Before he could act, Lo Tian was at his side. Golden fists vanished, striking the youth's body.

Thunderous roar echoed as a dull sound rose from Lo Tian's fist. The youth's face bore disbelief before his body turned into a pile of flesh, scattered at Lo Tian's feet.

"What happened?" No one expected someone to suddenly attack. When they reacted, the youth was already a blood mist.

Upon realizing the situation, everyone stood frozen, watching Lo Tian flee to another direction.

"Murder!" Someone shouted, pulling them back to reality. At the same time, another blood mist rose.

"Reckless! How dare he kill!" Zhou Cang's group gleamed with joy, stunned Lo Tian dared to openly murder.

"Boom..." The third blood mist rose, leaving everyone gasping.

"This Lo Tian's mad! Everyone attack and kill him!" Zhou Cang roared, his voice laced with excitement. He formed a golden blade with his hands, slicing toward Lo Tian.

"Kill him! We're not the ones who started it!" Others shouted, their voices angry. They unleashed martial arts toward Lo Tian.

"Dammit, they've attacked our doorstep! Brothers, follow me! Kill these bastards!" Ye Liangchen roared, brandishing a mid-grade immortal artifact longsword in one hand and a long knife in the other. His body emitted clinking sounds.

"Kill!" Huozhen growled, his True Immortal peak power fully unleashed, his aura surging toward the crowd.

Over a hundred others roared, their eyes glowing with fierce light. Each wore at least five immortal artifacts, their aura overwhelming.

"Too... too rich..." The Eighth Army's people heard the fighting and arrived at Lo Tian's courtyard, their faces filled with admiration.

"Dammit, each has at least five mid-grade immortal artifacts! Look at Ye Liangchen—his body is adorned with artifacts, at least ten. His belt and shoes are all mid-grade! Is he so extravagant? I heard he exchanged ten high-grade immortal artifacts. With his relationship with Lo Tian, they must have split them—maybe even given all to Ye Liangchen!" They whispered.

"Why are there bloodstains? Is Lo Tian seeking death?" Soon, they saw Lo Tian, like a tiger among sheep, having killed seven people.

Though Lo Tian kept killing, Ye Liangchen's group received his mental transmission, only holding back. Lo Tian would kill.

A hundred people couldn't match hundreds initially. But Ye Liangchen's group, with their equipment advantage, held off the hundreds.

"Commanders, why haven't they arrived? Will they let this military camp bloodshed happen?" People wondered, puzzled about the commanders' plans.

Time passed. More people died at Lo Tian's hands, blood splattering outside his courtyard. As time went on, Lo Tian slowed his attacks—starting with True Immortal peaks, then half-step True Immortals.

In the City Lord's hall, twelve people sat, watching a screen showing Lo Tian's fearless killing.

"This kid dared to kill first—showing he guessed our intent. His mind is sharp!" Zhu Ge Hong fanned himself, his voice laced with amusement.

"His combat power can kill True Immortal peaks but might barely survive True Immortal mid-levels," Guan Yong added, his voice filled with admiration.

Chapter 2034: Exposed Spies

"One hundred people!" The Eighth Army's people shouted, their voices filled with disbelief. From the initial kills to now, Lo Tian would inevitably kill them all—True Immortal peaks, half-step True Immortals, or even True Immortal peaks.

But True Immortal peak deaths took longer, with some managing to escape. Yet they were all hunted down and killed by Lo Tian.

"Lo Tian seems to target these people specifically! Look at Zhou Cang—those who shouted loudest earlier, but now they're fine."

"Dammit, how did he find out our plan!" A youth hid in the crowd, watching Lo Tian's relentless killing. His face was grim.

This youth was a minor spy leader from Hell. Though his strength was only half-step True Immortal, he could identify several spies among them. He coordinated with these people to relay messages.

"Kill!" Lo Tian's gaze gradually shifted to the youth, his eyes cold.

"I was right," Lo Tian thought, calm now. The people he'd killed had killer intent toward him. Yet no high-ranking figures emerged, not even a major officer—this was suspicious. Lo Tian knew his guess was correct and killed more fiercely.

"Perhaps we've been exposed. We must kill Lo Tian with his Ghost-Controlling Seal!" The youth thought, then transmitted to those he could contact.

"Ghost Commander, Li Jianxing!" Hearing the youth's transmission, twenty-something figures from Hell's spies flew out, breaking free of Ye Liangchen's group to charge toward Lo Tian.

"Idiots, you only just realized? It's too late!" Lo Tian thought. If the hundred had attacked him fully at first, he might have been overwhelmed. But now, after killing a hundred people, the remaining dozens were nothing to him. Plus, Ye Liangchen's group helped distract them.

With this thought, Lo Tian fully unleashed his power, fists flying, golden shadows tearing through space as he fought twenty opponents.

Half of the twenty were True Immortal peaks, half half-step. Any half-step facing these twenty would be crushed. Yet Lo Tian dodged their attacks and killed two.

"Ten Thousand Ghosts Devour Immortals!" The ghost commander youth finally understood Lo Tian's strength. This wasn't a trap against Lo Tian but against them—this trap's key was whether Lo Tian could identify these spies.

"Perhaps we'll catch a few big fish!" In the hall, Jiang Chen's group smiled, watching Li Jianxing's group fully unleash.

Boom... Boom...

As Li Jianxing spoke, twenty people surged with power, their eyes fierce. Their hands moved, black qi spewing from them, forming a massive net to engulf Lo Tian, obscuring the crowd's view.
