Kneeling before the statue, Zhuge Qingtian then placed his hand upon its imposing form, his eyes alight with exhilaration.

"Something's wrong with the statue!" As Zhuge Qingtian prepared to lay his hand upon it, Luotian and the others furrowed their brows, their bodies rising into the air as they surged toward the statue.

"Stop them for just a few heartbeats!" Zhuge Qingtian barked at Zhu Gejie and Zhu Heichao, then closed his eyes without a second glance.

"This..." Zhu Gejie's expression twisted into a bitter smile as he gazed at the formidable Luotian and his companions, mentally cursing: "How can we possibly hold them back with just the two of us?"

Yet, recalling Zhuge Qingtian's orders and the rewards awaiting them should he reveal his inheritance, Zhu Gejie's resolve hardened.

"Get out of the way!" Sun Miechen surged forward first, his hands summoning the Divine King's Nine Heavens Map to crush them, his gaze cold and unyielding.

"Primordial Chaos Awakens!" Zhu Gejie's eyes blazed with fierce determination, clearly不服 Sun Miechen.

"Buzz..." A tremor rippled from Zhou Wei's hands, stars shimmering as a vast star pattern coalesced into an immense net, enveloping Zhu Heichao.

"I am in the late era of the epoch; you still linger in the middle era. Daring to strike me?" Zhu Heichao's face curled with disdain as a surge of gray energy erupted from his hands, forming a chaotic seal that collided with the unseen tremors.

"Shura's Killing Strike!" Yan Hongtao's form flickered in and out of existence, a blood-red head emerging like a venomous fang behind Zhu Gejie, lunging for his heart.

Meanwhile, Luotian and the others stood motionless, their gazes fixed on Zhuge Qingtian's hand upon the stone statue.

"Strike! Once Zhuge Qingtian secures the inheritance, we'll be left with nothing but scraps!" Sun Kemin's eyes burned with urgency as he addressed Luotian.

"Attack!" Luotian's body flashed like a beam of white light, surging toward Zhuge Qingtian.

Following closely behind him were Long Jie and Sun Kemin, who flew toward Zhuge Qingtian. The moment they did, the faces of Zhu Gejie and Zhu Heichao, locked in battle with Sun Miechen and Yan Hongtao, darkened instantly.

The three men had them pinned so thoroughly that they could not divert their attention to intercept Luotian's group.

Luotian's fist erupted with overwhelming might, directly striking Zhuge Qingtian. Long Jie followed swiftly, spitting out a royal Dao dragon qi that formed into a dragon seal, crushing toward Zhuge Qingtian.

Just as they launched their attacks, Zhuge Qingtian's expression abruptly shifted, his eyes blazing with fierce hostility.

"Damn it! The inheritance has been taken!" Zhuge Qingtian's face darkened, then he struck Luotian with a punch. Simultaneously, his other hand shot out, forming a gray finger to clash against Long Jie's dragon seal.

"What?" Luotian recoiled, his gaze filled with disbelief after clashing with Zhuge Qingtian. He ceased further attacks immediately.

At the same time, the others heard Zhuge Qingtian's words and halted their actions, confusion flickering in their eyes as they turned toward him.

"Zhuge Qingtian, stop the nonsense and produce the inheritance! We've fought so hard—there's no way we'll leave empty-handed!" Sun Miechen barked, his voice laced with threat.

"Who? Who dares touch my inheritance? If I find out, I'll flay you alive and leave no trace of your bones!" Zhuge Qingtian roared in fury, his voice shaking the heavens and earth. Luotian's group felt a flicker of belief in his words.

"Who are you? Why have you appeared here?" Just as they pondered, a clear and cold female voice echoed behind them, causing their minds to jolt. They turned sharply.

Chapter 1445: Battle Against Zhuge Qingtian

The sudden voice made their bodies halt. None among them were ordinary; yet, none sensed the woman's arrival, prompting a growing sense of caution.

"Who?" They turned sharply, eyes wary as they gazed at the intruder. Their brows furrowed instantly.

Two exquisite faces emerged in their vision, radiating an icy aura as they scrutinized the group.

Luotian turned with them, his gaze falling upon their faces. His body trembled instantly, a look of ecstatic joy flashing in his eyes as he dashed toward the two women.

"Luotian!" Seeing Luotian rush to her side, the two figures trembled as their eyes widened in disbelief. They had never expected to meet the one they longed for here.

"Sixi, Qiuchan!" Luotian swept the two women into his arms, a look of longing in his eyes, nearly choked.

The two women were the two wives Luotian had sought among four. How could he not be overjoyed? He greedily inhaled their scents, his eyes filled with concern.

Clearly, the two women had been trapped here for a long time; without Luotian's arrival, they would never have escaped from the depths of this chaotic abyss.

The third trial set by the Master of Chaos required nine people to solve, an impossibility for just two women.

Jiang Sixi and Leng Qiuchan softened their expressions, losing all icy coldness. They resembled timid women as they leaned into Luotian's embrace.

Time within the cave froze, a warm atmosphere spreading throughout it. The three of them seemed to forget time's passage and the presence of others within the cave.

"It was you who obtained my master's inheritance!" Just as they were immersed in their emotions, a cold voice echoed through the cave, shattering their tender moment.

Hearing this cold voice, Luotian separated from the two women and scrutinized them, his eyes filled with confusion.

After careful observation, Luotian realized the two women had reached the middle epoch and their auras were immensely powerful, giving an impression of unfathomable depth. Moreover, he sensed a destructive aura within their bodies, even causing him to feel a shiver of awe.

"Yes, we two obtained the Master of Chaos's inheritance," Jiang Sixi spoke softly, her voice carrying a gentle tone as if she hadn't heard Zhuge Qingtian's words. She was merely explaining to Luotian at this moment, embodying the role of a tender woman.

"Brilliant!" Luotian's face softened as he lightly touched the two women's faces, causing them to blush.

"Zhuge Qingtian, this inheritance was destined for its rightful owner. You are already so powerful—why cling to it?" Luotian smiled, gazing at Zhuge Qingtian. He noticed the latter's cold eyes and furrowed his brows deeply.

"Hah! This inheritance was originally prepared for me by my master. I toiled endlessly and came here with great effort. You expect me to abandon it? Do you think I am some kind-hearted fool! My things will ultimately belong to me!"

"In the era when my master subdued the heavens and earth, I was invincible. In this epoch, I remain undefeated. I give you two choices: either let me extract the inheritance mark from their bodies, or I will kill them and take it myself!" Zhuge Qingtian's face was cold, his demeanor starkly different from before. His commanding voice echoed through the cave as an aura of the late epoch gradually rose.

Zhu Gejie and Zhu Heichao also bore cold expressions, standing by Zhuge Qingtian's side. Clearly, they harbored deep resentment toward Luotian, which now erupted fully.

Their auras coalesced into a terrifying storm, sweeping toward Luotian's group with immense pressure. Luotian furrowed his brows slightly.

"Have the guts and take it yourself!" Jiang Sixi's face was cold; she was tender toward Luotian but a block of ice to others.

"Roar..." A low growl echoed through the cave as a green beast emerged from beside Leng Qiuchan. Its fur shimmered with emerald light, and its碧色 eyes glowed with boundless ferocity.

"Little Wolf?" Luotian's eyes flickered, instantly recognizing the green wolf as the one he and Leng Qiuchan had once nurtured.

Luotian hadn't expected this tiny creature to now radiate such power, its presence exuding the aura of a wolf king.

Seeing Luotian, the green beast instantly softened, approaching him and gently licking his palm.

"Luotian, I advise you to hand it over," Sun Miechen spoke, his body aglow with golden light as he gazed at Luotian.

"Laughing, women in your eyes are perhaps mere possessions. But they are my wives, who bore me children and are the most important people in my life. I entered here because it concerns my wives' and descendants' lives!" Luotian's foot trembled, and the pressure from Zhuge Qingtian's group was instantly dispelled.

"Then fight!" Zhuge Qingtian's eyes brimmed with battle intent, gazing at Luotian with a deep and cold expression.

"Are you afraid?" Luotian's voice rang out, standing before Jiang Sixi and Leng Qiuchan. His aura surged skyward as his power skyrocketed.

"Come on, I want to see what's so extraordinary about your Reincarnation Body!" Zhuge Qingtian's body flickered, his late epoch power erupting as he surged toward Luotian.

"Then let me show you!" Luotian laughed, unleashing the Dao Sealing Demon Fist that roared toward Zhuge Qingtian.

Their movements fully ignited the battlefield, Zhu Gejie's eyes filled with combat intent as he rushed toward Jiang Sixi and Leng Qiuchan. He knew that if they were killed, Zhuge Qingtian would surely find a way to extract the Master of Chaos's inheritance mark.

"Primordial Chaos Body, Zhu Gejie?" Jiang Sixi sneered, her body emitting a thunderous sound. Even facing Zhu Gejie, she showed no fear.

"Madam, leave it to me. You two watch from the sidelines!" Long Jie rushed ahead of the two women, a smile on his face as he blocked Zhu Gejie's path.

"Ha! Little beauty, just submit to us!" Zhu Heichao sneered, addressing Jiang Sixi and Leng Qiuchan.

"Alas, some people truly lack shame!" A playful voice echoed as a white light surged upward, Yangyu enveloping Sun Kemin's head and blocking Zhu Heichao.

As Luotian's group clashed, only Sun Miechen, Yan Hongtao, and Zhou Wei remained in the cave, standing there with contemplative expressions.

"This inheritance belongs to me!" Sun Miechen mused, then his body radiated divine light. His gaze turned toward Jiang Sixi and Leng Qiuchan, who were ignored, a light laugh escaping him.

"You dare!" Luotian clashed with Zhuge Qingtian, but he constantly observed Sun Miechen's group.

Seeing Sun Miechen rush toward Jiang Sixi and Leng Qiuchan, Luotian leapt into the air, unleashing the Divine King's Nine Heavens Map to crush Sun Miechen.

"Get out of the way!" A long sword cut through the air, Sun Miechen's eyes flashing cold as he noticed Luotian still attacking. He suddenly turned and rushed toward Luotian.

Sun Miechen knew that the group's pillar was Luotian; if he fell, the two women would have no resistance.

"Truly underestimating me!" Zhuge Qingtian sneered, watching Luotian attempt to fight two at once. This was a slight against him.

"Buzz..." A gray long sword fell into Zhuge Qingtian's hands, its blade slicing through the void and appearing before Luotian.

Zhuge Qingtian's power was already in the late epoch, and his strength had increased further within the chaos storm's palace. At this moment, he was confident that even a late epoch powerhouse could be fought and then escape.

At the moment the blade formed, Luotian instantly felt a tremendous crisis, his hair standing on end as his gaze turned serious.

"Indeed, the disciple of the Master of Chaos!" Luotian's body flickered as he summoned the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, which unleashed a boundless sword intent. It clashed with Zhuge Qingtian's blade.

"Crack..." Thunderous sounds erupted from their collision, then vanished into the shattered void. Invisible waves of pressure surged before Luotian and Zhuge Qingtian.

"Boom..." Luotian's body was hurled backward, and as he retreated, buildings crumbled.

"Gods' Sigh!" As Luotian stumbled and hadn't yet steadied himself, a series of golden figures emerged before him. Sun Miechen's body glowed with golden light, and a golden figure stood behind him, sighing longingly toward Luotian.

Golden divine patterns spewed from the golden figure's mouth, sweeping toward Luotian. Each inscription carried an immense fluctuation, clearly a formidable martial art.

"Get out of the way!" Black demonic energy surged upward like a mountain, crashing down and pressing against those golden inscription chains.

The thunderous sound was overwhelming; the golden inscription dragons were instantly destroyed, but Luotian's face suddenly changed. A series of explosive sounds echoed from his back, causing him to turn sharply.

Chapter 1446: Chaos Reveals Its Might

A gray long sword, radiating overwhelming might, swept toward Luotian like a world-ending force. Luotian's face darkened instantly.

"Chaos Destroying Demon Slash!" Zhuge Qingtian's low voice echoed, his eyes filled with intense confidence.

Chaos Destroying Demon Slash was his signature move before he was sealed by the Master of Chaos. Many圣子 (holy sons) from the sacred sects had been slain by it in the past.

"Barbarian God's Third Step Shatters Stars!" Luotian had no time to catch his breath before he took a step forward, his black foot radiating overwhelming might. It clashed with the gray blade.

The cave space trembled as well. Fortunately, it was the Master of Chaos's cave; otherwise, their clash would have razed an entire continent.

"Divine King's Cross Slash!" Luotian's body was battered as Sun Miechen's voice rang out. A cross-shaped sword light swept toward Luotian, slicing through him.

After clashing with Zhuge Qingtian for a while, Luotian was already struggling. Fighting two at once was truly challenging.

In an instant, a massive cross-shaped sword light appeared before Luotian, slicing into his body.

Luotian's eyes narrowed slightly as his five Reincarnation Immortal Bodies surged into action, attempting to withstand Sun Miechen's powerful strike.

Blood splattered; the cross-shaped sword light seemed to want to dismember Luotian, and intense pain instantly invaded his nerves.

A cross-shaped wound appeared on Luotian's chest, and divine blood spilled out, making his face pale.

"Reincarnation Body, nothing special!" Zhuge Qingtian looked down at Luotian with disdain, speaking as if he were a millennia-old emperor looking at a subject.

"Hah! Luotian, I never thought you'd be in this situation!" Sun Miechen's golden robe fluttered as his eyes held mockery. He remembered the humiliation Luotian had once brought him, and the defeat at the Divine Clan's sacred mountain was a lifelong disgrace for Sun Miechen.

"Barbarian God's Third Step Shatters Ghosts!"

"Barbarian God's Fourth Step Drives Back the Gods!"

"Barbarian God's Fifth Step Shakes the World!" Luotian, spitting blood, glared with killing intent. His Barbarian God's image roared forth behind him, as tangible as reality. The massive figure raised its foot, shaking the heavens and the abyss below.

At the third step, Zhuge Qingtian's face suddenly changed, his gaze finally showing concern. His hands moved, and a gray figure materialized behind him, its massive palm rushing toward Luotian's attack.

"Divine King Ascends to the Nine Heavens!" Sun Miechen roared, his eyes cold. He knew this was the decisive moment; Luotian's three steps could annihilate anyone in the middle epoch.

"Boom..." A massive Divine King image formed again, as if confronting Luotian's Barbarian God.

"This is Luotian's true strength!" Zhou Wei and Yan Hongtao's eyes were filled with amazement. They hadn't expected Luotian to be this powerful.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." The thunderous sound was overwhelming, and the cave space seemed to explode. Wild fluctuations swept outward, destroying everything within the cave except for the towering stone statue of the Master of Chaos.

"Spit... Spitting blood, Luotian fell to the ground, his body battered. Sun Miechen was no better off.

But Zhuge Qingtian stood amidst the explosion's turbulence, his face pale but his aura still overwhelming.

"Truly underestimated you! If I were in the middle epoch, I wouldn't have been your match!" Zhuge Qingtian's eyes showed a flicker of admiration.

"Your strength, even in any era, is unquestionably the strongest among your peers. Unfortunately, you met me and others like me. This era's glory will never belong to you, even if you are a Reincarnation Body; you can only be a backdrop!" Zhuge Qingtian spoke as his hands moved rapidly.

"Buzz..." A gray shadow rose again behind Zhuge Qingtian, moving in tandem with his actions.

A powerful fluctuation surged throughout the cave space, causing everyone's faces to change abruptly. Even Luotian's face was filled with shock.

In the midst of their clash, a gray long bow appeared in the hands of the gray figure. A long gray arrow, like a column reaching to heaven, radiated immense penetrating power as it was released.

"Chaos Destroying Divine Bow!" Jiang Sixi and Leng Qiuchan's faces changed instantly, their gazes turning to the gray arrow. They had obtained the Master of Chaos's inheritance and naturally understood the power of this weapon.

They hadn't fought from the beginning because they trusted Luotian, and he had told them not to interfere. They also enjoyed being protected by him. But now that Luotian was in danger, they couldn't sit idly by.

"Final Kill!" Zhuge Qingtian's face was cold as he spoke, and a terrifying storm swept around the massive gray arrow.

"Crash..." The heavens collapsed, and the cave space began to tremble as if an earthquake had occurred. The gray arrow seemed slow, but it flew toward Luotian.

"Damn! Why are all these epoch masters' offspring and disciples so strong!" Luotian's mind trembled as he watched the gray arrow approach.

Luotian knew that if it hit him, he might die here with no chance of survival.

"Did I really have to resort to my secret weapon?" Luotian sighed deeply in his heart. Facing this massive gray arrow, he had no confidence. Even if he took the sixth step, it wasn't enough. The only thing left was to use the two divine energies within his Reincarnation Immortal Bodies to break through.

"Die!" Sun Miechen's eyes flashed with coldness as he watched Luotian. His golden sword danced, then hovered above his head, expanding dramatically and rushing toward Luotian.

"Who dies is uncertain!" Luotian's gaze fell on Sun Miechen's devastating attack. He finally made his decision to use that supreme aura.

"We'll help you!" As Luotian prepared to destroy one of his Reincarnation Immortal Bodies to end the battle, two fragrant winds appeared before him.

The two women moved their hands, and waves of fluctuation radiated from them. Their palms met, then they flew apart.

A gray curtain instantly appeared between the two women, and a chaotic aura rose within it.

Luotian was stunned; the gray arrow suddenly approached, but it seemed to be swallowed by the curtain and vanished from sight.

"Chaos Virtual Divine Realm! Damn, you two actually managed to open it!" Zhuge Qingtian's face darkened as he gazed at Leng Qiuchan and Jiang Sixi, speaking in disbelief.

"Chaos Virtual Divine Realm? The Master of Chaos's supreme secret technique?" Luotian's face also showed surprise. He had heard of this method before.

Chaos Virtual Divine Realm was a technique where the opponent's attack was absorbed into an unknown void. It was said that this void had been forged by the Master of Chaos with supreme methods, more stable than true void. Many people sealed by the Master of Chaos were exiled there.

Luotian hadn't expected Jiang Sixi and Leng Qiuchan to be able to open Chaos Virtual Divine Realm together.

Seeing Luotian's shock, the two women wore a slight smile of triumph. Obviously, it was happy to be valued by their beloved. However, Jiang Sixi and Leng Qiuchan had also paid a considerable price.

"Barbarian God's Sixth Step Shakes the Heavens!" Luotian roared, not wasting the仙气 on Zhuge Qingtian's attack. His black foot shattered all realms, stomping onto the golden sword and instantly destroying it beneath his feet.

The entire cave space seemed to be filled with the massive foot's barbaric aura, leaving people in awe of the sixth step's terror.

"Boom..." After destroying the sword, the black foot didn't stop but continued to crush toward Sun Miechen.

"This..." Sun Miechen's eyes widened in disbelief, unable to react as Luotian's most powerful strike hit him directly.

Golden divine blood rose from the gray foot, and Luotian coldly watched as it coalesced into Sun Miechen's form.

"You stepped on me, what of it? I stepped on you once before; now I do so again!" Luotian spoke softly, his voice filled with mockery.

"Not only will I step on you, but I'll kill you too! What of your Divine Clan's divine king? Die!" Luotian's body flickered as he rushed toward Sun Miechen, whose face was pale.

Hearing Luotian's words, Sun Miechen's face turned white and red alternately. He hadn't expected to be no match for Luotian now.

"Die!" Luotian's eyes were filled with killing intent, his black foot surging forward again to crush Sun Miechen.

"Ah... I'll fight you to the death!" Sun Miechen roared, his voice filled with madness. His disheveled hair flew as his aura surged again.

"Gods' Shaking the Nine Heavens!" Sun Miechen shouted, golden divine flames rising around him before entering his body.

Hearing Sun Miechen's roar, Luotian knew he was truly desperate. "Gods' Shaking the Nine Heavens" was a forbidden technique of the Divine Clan. It wasn't used unless in absolute desperation.

Chapter 1447: Resurrection?

Gods' Shaking the Nine Heavens, a forbidden martial art of the Divine Clan. Once used, it meant certain death, but its power was unparalleled.

Sun Miechen, ranked second among the nine bodies, burned his entire strength, making his attack terrifying.

"Ah..." As he flew through the air, Sun Miechen roared continuously, his voice filled with madness. He seemed determined to fight Luotian to the death.

In his mad state, Sun Miechen didn't use any martial arts because he knew that in this condition, his very self was the strongest technique.

Golden light pierced through the void, illuminating the entire gray cave space. Everyone watched Sun Miechen's madness with awe.

"Too crazy!" Sun Keming activated Yangyu, immediately subduing Zhu Heichao and slapping his face. His gaze turned to Sun Miechen, who was completely mad.

"Strong! Even I wouldn't be able to withstand it if I didn't give my all!" Zhuge Qingtian's eyes showed admiration as he watched Sun Miechen, who had burned all his strength.

Sun Miechen was proud; his outstanding talent and lineage gave him the right to be so. In fact, if Sun Miechen wanted to escape, no one in the group could stop him.

But he chose this extreme method to prove himself. Having been defeated twice by Luotian, Sun Miechen had gone mad with rage. Luotian had completely crushed his pride, something he couldn't accept.

At this moment, Sun Miechen earned admiration, even from Luotian, who showed a look of respect. But respect was one thing; he didn't want Sun Miechen to die.

"Boom..." The five Reincarnation Immortal Bodies surged rapidly, and Luotian's body emitted a thunderous sound. His blood pressure soared as his eyes turned ruthless, and white divine patterns burst from his body, imprinting themselves onto his form.

"Then let's see whose flesh and bone are stronger!" Luotian roared, knowing that no martial arts would help against Sun Miechen's overwhelming strength. So he chose the most brutal method, using his unparalleled flesh and bone to withstand it.

A golden and white light collided in front of everyone's eyes, followed by a massive explosion echoing through the cave space. Even Zhuge Qingtian felt slightly dizzy.

A dazzling light rose, marking a clash between two supreme bodies: the Reincarnation Body ranked first among the nine and the Timeless Immortal Body. Two supreme bodies clashed for the first time in this epoch.

After the light faded, a mist of blood fell from the sky, and a figure plummeted down, causing everyone's faces to change abruptly.

"Luotian!"

"Big brother!" Long Jie and the others flew up, rushing toward the figure falling from the sky with voices filled with worry.

"Did Luotian win?" Zhu Gejie's face was bitter as he watched the fallen Luotian, sighing softly.

Sun Miechen's strength was known to him; Zhu Gejie, though self-assured, knew that even with his status in the Primordial Sect, he couldn't defeat Sun Miechen.

At this moment, Luotian had defeated the Sun Miechen who used a forbidden technique. This proved that Luotian was undoubtedly the top of their generation.

"This guy is lucky he didn't harm his wife!" Yan Hongtao's face showed relief. He had been hesitant before, but now seeing Sun Miechen so pitiful, he was secretly glad for his decision.

" I've had enough of fighting him. Perhaps only the offspring and disciples of epoch masters are worthy to fight against Luotian!" Zhou Wei sighed deeply, gazing at Zhuge Qingtian standing in the sky.

"Spit... Spitting blood, Luotian was caught by Long Jie and Jiang Sixi. His body was covered in blood, still flowing out continuously. As he landed, he coughed violently.

Luotian felt his current state was extremely poor; although it wouldn't cost him his life, he had less than ten percent of his full strength.

The collision between them was brief but felt like an entire epoch to Luotian. He had nearly lost his strength, and the two Reincarnation Immortal Bodies remaining were due to the two divine energies within them. If not for that, he wasn't sure if his immortal bodies would have remained.

On the other side, blood mist fell, golden divine blood with immense divinity spilled onto the ground. The once mighty vitality gradually faded, causing people to feel a sense of melancholy.

"Sun Miechen is dead?" Yan Hongtao's eyes showed disbelief. Although Sun Miechen was annoying, his strength was undeniable. Yan Hongtao had never imagined that he would be killed by someone.

"Maybe," Zhou Wei's face also showed a sigh, but he didn't attempt to rescue. They all knew that using a forbidden technique meant no one could revive him unless an epoch master personally intervened.

"Enough, I suppose you have no more strength left. I advise you to hand them over; then you can live," Zhuge Qingtian's face was cold as he addressed the weakened Luotian.

"Daydream! Don't push me, or none of you will survive!" Luotian spoke weakly but with an unyielding tone.

"Hah! Luotian, you're still talking big!" Zhu Heichao stood there with a bruised face, his eyes filled with mockery.

Because of the chaos domain's nature, Sun Keming had subdued Zhu Heichao but hadn't killed him. They feared that if they left, it would provoke the chaos domain's madness.

"Spit... Spitting blood, Zhu Gejie stood there as well. He and Long Jie had fought evenly but couldn't overcome each other, both suffering injuries. Zhu Gejie was also curious why Luotian could still speak so boldly despite his state, especially with Zhuge Qingtian still present.

Not only did the three from the chaos domain feel confused, but all others except Sun Keming also wondered what secret weapon Luotian had.

"My things will ultimately belong to me. No matter your secrets, they're useless!" Zhuge Qingtian's face was cold with a smirk. He didn't care about Luotian's threat, as Luotian's current strength was too weak.

"This is what you forced me to do!" Luotian's face showed a cold smile, then nodded at Sun Keming. He waved his hand, summoning the Yin Fish.

"Two fragments of epoch treasures? If this is your secret weapon, then you've miscalculated!" Zhuge Qingtian's face showed a smile. He stopped his body, eyes filled with mockery.

"Believe in the Yin and Yang Grandmaster's eternal life... The Yin and Yang Grandmaster... His power is boundless... Yin and Yang united... Invincible under heaven!" Then, Luotian and Sun Keming recited the incantation of the Yin-Yang Double Fish in front of everyone's astonished gaze.

"Buzz..." As their words ended, the black and white double fish emitted a buzzing sound. They fused in the sky, forming an illusory divine and demonic Dao map that radiated overwhelming power, crushing toward Zhuge Qingtian.

"Hah! Indeed powerful, but I forgot to tell you something!" Zhuge Qingtian gazed at the divine and demonic Dao map descending from the sky, his eyes showing a smile.

"My master, the Master of Chaos, had the greatest talent in refining and alchemy. His achievements in these arts are unparalleled across history!"

"Everyone knows that each epoch master has only one epoch treasure. However, my master was an exception because of his refining skills. He left two epoch treasures: one for the Sacred Chaos Continent!"

"As I am my master's only disciple, the other epoch treasure must be where you can guess!" Zhuge Qingtian spoke softly. He waved his hand, and a black staff appeared in his hands. Then he lightly tossed it into the air.

The gray staff expanded dramatically, its gray patterns radiating overwhelming power, like a pillar of heaven. It crashed down toward the Yin-Yang Double Fish.

"Damn, I knew summoning us two would bring trouble!"

"Mother of god, can't you change it? Why are they all epoch treasures? Can't you find one that crushes us?" The Yin-Yang Double Fish's voices echoed in Luotian and Sun Keming's minds, cursing.

"Did he have an epoch treasure?" Luotian and the others hadn't expected Zhuge Qingtian to actually possess one.

"What do we do now?" Luotian and Sun Keming exchanged glances. Their only reliance was that divine energy.

"Crack..." Thunderous sounds echoed, shaking the heavens and earth. Wild fluctuations swept over everyone, pushing them back against the cave walls.

"Puke..." Luotian spat blood again, his Dan Tian's Reincarnation Immortal Bodies finally couldn't withstand it and shattered another one. His face changed instantly.

"Since they've all come out, let's finish them all!" Luotian's eyes flashed with coldness. He scanned the three of Zhuge Qingtian's group.

"Yan Xiong, Zhou Xiong, come here. You might be caught in the crossfire!" Luotian addressed Zhou Wei and Yan Hongtao.

"Hah! You have no plan left, do you? Trying to drag them two in?" Zhu Heichao's eyes showed mockery again.

"But before Zhu Heichao could finish his words, an overwhelming aura rose throughout the cave space.

Chapter 1448: The Master of Chaos's Intimidation
