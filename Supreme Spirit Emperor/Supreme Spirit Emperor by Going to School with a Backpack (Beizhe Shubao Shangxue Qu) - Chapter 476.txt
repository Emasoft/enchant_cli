“Go!” Luo Tian extended his hand, and the black Soul-Controlling Seal surged forward. Patterns formed along the trajectory of the seal, while mournful cries rose from the End Times Forest. Sinister ghostly qi emerged within the forest, rushing toward the flying seal. The Soul-Controlling Seal expanded rapidly in flight, seizing the heavens and earth.

“Is this—?” Ruan Xinghe gazed at the Soul-Controlling Seal, which seemed to shroud the entire sky. His face bore astonishment, his body trembling involuntarily under the immense pressure.

“Huanmie Star River!” Ruan Xinghe’s face twisted with madness. His hands moved again, and the stars within the star river that pierced heaven and earth collided violently, unleashing terrifying power.

In an instant, the massive Soul-Controlling Seal clashed with the star river. Thunderous roars echoed through the sky, and a cacophony of explosions erupted above.

“Boom… boom… boom…” Under Ruan Xinghe’s stunned gaze, his star river was crushed by the black ghost seal. Stars shattered one after another, condensing into fragments of divine qi that rained down from the sky, toppling vast stretches of forest.

“Truly useful!” Luo Tian’s face also bore astonishment. He had not expected the first use of the Soul-Controlling Seal to be so powerful, far exceeding his expectations.

When Luo Tian refined the Soul-Controlling Seal to a high level, he realized it could not only control ghosts but also serve as a formidable offensive technique. At its peak, it rivaled high-level immortal martial arts.

The thunderous roar lasted for half a bell, then faded. Night returned to its darkness, and the entire world turned pitch-black, as if all the stars in the sky had vanished.

“Now, are you still the king of this darkness?” A cold voice echoed. A streak of light pierced through the gloom, restoring the silent world to its former state. Yet the End Times Forest resembled a scene of apocalypse—within ten miles, everything lay in ruins. Luo Tian’s figure appeared before Ruan Xinghe, whose face was pale.

“Boom!” A heavy sound echoed as Luo Tian loomed over Ruan Xinghe and struck him with a fist, directly impacting his body.

“Crack!” Ruan Xinghe’s body emitted a brittle sound, collapsing into the ground.

“Howling Moon Sky Wolves” howled, rushing toward Ruan Xinghe and tearing him to shreds after he was severely wounded.

“Blame yourself for provoking me!” Luo Tian’s face remained cold as he returned to Long Youlan, who stood in stunned silence.

“It was sheer coincidence that both you and Zhu Fenghuo had ungrateful younger brothers. You two share a strange connection!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly.

“Grrr…” The Howling Moon Sky Wolf King growled, its wounds emitting mournful sounds.

“Enough. Rest here,” Luo Tian said coldly, inspecting the Wolf King’s injuries. Finding no serious harm, he placed a medicinal pill into its mouth.

Luo Tian ascended into the air, his gaze cold. Earlier, Duan Chengfeng had also attacked him. If not for the divine herb’s allure, Duan might have stayed behind. Thus, Luo Tian had no choice but to reveal his final ace.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian stepped into the void, unleashing his full speed. His mind worried for Gu Qianxue’s safety—she had been the first to fly toward that light curtain.

“Qianxue’s cultivation was at the middle stage of Celestial Immortality. Against Duan Chengfeng, she had no chance at all!” Luo Tian muttered internally. He also knew Gu Qianxue was no ordinary person; merely that ghost sword from the Dragon’s Tomb was enough to challenge most.

“Boom…” After flying for a bell, thunderous roars echoed in Luo Tian’s mind. He sensed immense vitality, but the vitality carried an ominous deathly aura.

In a blink, Luo Tian arrived at the location of the battle. His expression darkened sharply.

Two figures clashed repeatedly—Gu Qianxue and Duan Chengfeng. Duan wielded a long sword, slashing relentlessly. Gu Qianxue brandished her ghost head sword, clashing with Duan repeatedly.

What stunned Luo Tian was that Gu Qianxue had already suppressed Duan, and severely so.

“Middle-stage Celestial Immortality—yet such combat power!” Duan Chengfeng’s mind reeled. He had never imagined Gu Qianxue could subdue him so thoroughly; such a feat was rare even in the immortal realm.

“What has Qianxue endured?” Luo Tian muttered lowly. He then descended to the edge of their battlefield, gazing at a pool of yellow water bubbling nearby. That was what truly shocked him.

The yellow spring gushed steadily, its range no more than several zhang. Yet it radiated an eerie chill. Wisps of gray mist drifted above the water, and a three-petaled flower bloomed within.

“Huangquan孕育彼岸，彼岸花开七色天，花开花落一千年！花开花落开不断，奈何桥前叹奈何！” Luo Tian muttered lowly, gazing at the three-petaled blossom. His eyes reflected intense shock.

“How is this possible!” Luo Tian shouted again, stunned to find the legendary Biyang Flower from Huangquan (Yellow Spring) here.

“Son, help me subdue this demoness. She has defected from the Heavenly Ghost Sect!” Duan Chengfeng shouted, repelled by Gu Qianxue’s strike.

Gu Qianxue was enveloped in black qi, her white hands gripping the ghost head sword. She resembled a female Mahakala emerging from hell, striking relentlessly and forcing Duan to retreat.

“Subdue?” Luo Tian sneered. He then leapt into the air, his golden spear materializing in hand. A storm of spears rained toward Duan.

“Damn!” Duan’s face darkened. Repelled by Gu Qianxue, he was now overwhelmed by Luo Tian’s assault, with no chance to evade.

“Two beasts! If not for that sword’s trickery, I would have killed you effortlessly!” Duan mentally roared. Yet Luo Tian’s attack had him on edge.

“His cultivation has advanced!” Duan suddenly sensed Luo Tian had also reached the middle stage of Celestial Immortality.

Duan dared not face Luo Tian’s attack. His body twisted abruptly, slicing with a blade that clashed against the storm of spears.

“Earlier I was quite embarrassed by you!” Luo Tian’s face remained cold. Though Duan blocked his attack, he materialized before Duan with a single step, unleashing the Dao of Sealing and Crushing.

“Huff…” Gu Qianxue repelled Duan, exhaling deeply. She glanced at Luo Tian’s fist strike, her eyes narrowing slightly.

“Extreme Realm!” Gu Qianxue muttered lowly. Though Luo Tian had given her an Unlimit Break Immortal Pill, she hadn’t reached the Extreme Realm. Her ability to subdue Duan stemmed entirely from her ghost head sword and unique techniques.

“Boom… boom…” Thunderous roars echoed as a storm of fists enveloped Duan. His body retreated again, his mind astounded by Luo Tian’s combat power.

“Damn it! How could both of you be monsters!” Duan mentally roared. Earlier, Gu Qianxue had subdued him due to her strange sword, which allowed her to fight at the late-stage Celestial Immortality level. Each strike pierced his soul.

But now, Luo Tian relied purely on his strength, leaving Duan no chance to retaliate.

“Who in the immortal realm can cross levels? Today I’ve met two!” Duan’s mind seethed with frustration.

“Boom… boom…” Luo Tian’s flesh and bone were invincible. Each punch struck, and Duan’s body emitted heavy and brittle sounds.

“Old man, die!” As time passed, Luo Tian sensed Duan’s power waning. He sneered and unleashed the Soul-Controlling Seal, which crashed onto Duan’s body.

“Boom!” Duan was struck directly, spitting blood and collapsing to the ground. His eyes reflected weakness.

Luo Tian took a step forward, stomping on Duan’s back. His face bore mockery: “Old man, now do you still want to kill me?”

“Luo Tian, you cannot kill me. I am one of the Eight Elders of the Heavenly Ghost Sect. My master is even a Grand Elder. If you kill me, you’ll never stay in the Heavenly Ghost Sect. My master will hunt you to the ends of the earth, even with Master Xue’s protection!” Duan, though extremely weak, forced out his final breath to Luo Tian.

Chapter 1841: Biyang Flower

“Using the Grand Elder against me?” Luo Tian’s face bore disdain. He knew even if he released Duan, the Grand Elder would never let him live.

“He truly wants to kill me!” Duan felt Luo Tian’s killing intent. He hadn’t expected that even after mentioning the Grand Elder, Luo Tian would still kill him.

“Die!” Luo Tian’s crackling spear was in hand. He had always been decisive and ruthless, driving the sharp spear toward Duan.

“Finished…” Duan’s mind was despairing. A true sense of death overtook him, but he could not fight back. Luo Tian’s foot pressed like a mountain, suffocating him.

“Buzz…” Just as the crackling spear was about to pierce Duan’s heart, a black blade appeared on the spear.

“Crack!” The ghost head sword lightly collided with the crackling spear, altering its trajectory. The spear pierced Duan’s shoulder instead.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, gazing at Gu Qianxue. He wondered why she had stopped him from killing Duan.

“Why did you go to the Disrupting Heaven Sect?” Gu Qianxue coldly asked, then said nothing more. Her gaze remained on the Biyang Flower above Huangquan.

“Can’t kill?” Luo Tian’s brow furrowed. He had come out to check if the Disrupting Heaven Sect had captured any of his acquaintances. Going there himself might mean they wouldn’t release the captives, but Duan, as a Heavenly Ghost Sect Elder, would ensure their release.

“Ah…” As Luo Tian hesitated, Duan’s face twisted with madness. His body’s essence began to burn fiercely, his injuries healing instantly under the surge of power. In a desperate move, he unleashed infinite potential and escaped Luo Tian’s grasp, fleeing without hesitation.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s face darkened. Though only for an instant, Duan was at the late-stage Celestial Immortality level. His desperate speed had vanished without a trace.

“I made such a mistake!” Luo Tian’s face darkened. He cursed himself for his hesitation, an error he hadn’t committed in a long time.

“Never mind. Since he’s escaped, let him go,” Luo Tian muttered lowly. He then gazed at Gu Qianxue.

At that moment, Gu Qianxue’s eyes held a complex expression. She gazed at the three-petaled Biyang Flower in the Huangquan.

“Why is there a Huangquan here?” Luo Tian’s mind was puzzled. He had once entered the Reincarnation Passage to save Ji Jiuyou, encountering Huangquan and seeing two formidable figures there.

“It’s an entrance. Look closely at the spring’s location,” Gu Qianxue whispered.

Hearing her words, Luo Tian’s eyes focused on the source of the Huangquan—a fist-sized hole appeared in his vision.

“Never expected this place would sprout a Biyang Flower!” Gu Qianxue’s eyes held solemnity. The Biyang Flower was a hellish marvel, classified as a divine herb but a vital supplement for ghost cultivators. Its greatest use was absorbing the pure ghost qi within to enhance cultivation.

“Do you want this Biyang Flower?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, sensing Gu Qianxue’s longing.

“Mm.”

“I’ll fetch it for you,” Luo Tian said without hesitation, flying toward the Biyang Flower.

“Buzz…” However, just as he moved, a black ghost head sword appeared before him, blocking his path.

“You can’t take it,” Gu Qianxue coldly said, gazing at the Biyang Flower.

“The Biyang Flower is a hellish item. If a human touches it, it will disintegrate immediately. Moreover, this Huangquan isn’t easy to handle!” Gu Qianxue picked up a stone and tossed it into the pool. It plummeted, instantly turning to white smoke.

“Huangquan is for purifying souls. Those who cross it will have their memories erased,” she explained.

“To take the Biyang Flower, you need a creature with hellish aura. Bring your three-headed dog here.”

“If you can obtain the Biyang Flower, I’ll owe you a favor. Though you may look down on this favor, you’ll find it crucial in the future,” Gu Qianxue said.

“Black!” Before Gu Qianxue finished, Luo Tian summoned his three-headed dog.

“Grrr…” Hearing Luo Tian’s call, the three-headed dog rushed toward them with the Howling Moon Sky Wolf King and Long Youlan.

Within a bell, the three-headed dog’s massive body appeared beside Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue. When it saw the Biyang Flower, its silver eyes glowed with greed.

“Do you want it too?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, sensing the three-headed dog’s desire.

“Three-headed dogs were once rulers of hell. Absorbing the Biyang Flower would greatly benefit them,” Gu Qianxue blocked the three-headed dog, preventing it from succumbing to temptation.

“Grrr…” The three-headed dog growled at Gu Qianxue, emitting a wary aura.

“I don’t want the Biyang Flower. I want three petals!” Gu Qianxue whispered, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Moreover, your three-headed dog can absorb the Biyang Flower within its body, nurturing it to bloom again.” She added, fearing Luo Tian’s refusal.

“Fine,” Luo Tian nodded. He then addressed the three-headed dog: “Black, do as she says!”

“Woof!” The three-headed dog growled lowly. Though reluctant, it couldn’t defy Luo Tian.

The three heads approached the Huangquan and inhaled deeply. The water, which could purify everything, was instantly swallowed.

“Damn!” Luo Tian watched the three-headed dog’s absurdity. He felt the Huangquan’s threat but was stunned it devoured it like water.

“There’s nothing strange about it. Huangquan is ineffective against hellish beings, only purifying un-reincarnated souls. The three-headed dog is a king beast of hell, so it’s immune to Huangquan—indeed, Huangquan enhances its power!” Gu Qianxue explained.

“Exactly what have you endured? Why do you know so much?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, gazing at Gu Qianxue. This Gu Qianxue was no longer the one he had known—completely transformed.

“Enough,” Gu Qianxue ignored Luo Tian’s question, gazing at the Huangquan now drained by the three-headed dog.

After absorbing it, the pool was completely emptied. The ground appeared in Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue’s view.

“I’ll fetch it for you!” Without Huangquan, Luo Tian smiled and stepped toward the Biyang Flower.

“Stop!” But Gu Qianxue’s words were too late. Before she could speak, Luo Tian had already stepped onto the dried ground.

“Buzz…” Next moment, waves of energy radiated from the Biyang Flower, sweeping toward Luo Tian.

“Got it!” Luo Tian felt dizziness and disorientation. The surroundings changed, and he opened his eyes to find himself under the stars—this starry atmosphere was oddly familiar.

“Why am I here?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, puzzled by his sudden appearance in the Nine Realms.

“Who are you?” Just as Luo Tian pondered, a voice echoed in his ears. Several streaks of light flew toward him.

“Hmph… there’s my bloodline aura on you!” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, gazing at the youths approaching.

“Who are you?” Seeing them, Luo Tian wanted to know what was happening. Their cultivation was only at the Saint level.

Luo Tian extended his hand, grabbing them and pulling them before him.

“You…” The youths appeared before Luo Tian, their eyes filled with fear.

“Impossible! He directly grabbed us. Is he a half-epoch?” The youths’ eyes showed fear.

“Who are you?” Luo Tian asked the youth with a faint bloodline aura.

“I am Luo Qi, from the Tianyuan Continent’s Luo Family!” The youth’s face bore fear. He felt this young man was familiar but couldn’t recall where, yet he was certain this person was a great immortal.

“Luo Qi, what’s Luo Li?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, confusion in his gaze. He sensed something was amiss.

“Luo Li? Elder Master Luo Li of our family!” The youth’s eyes widened in disbelief.

“That’s my son! I am Luo Tian!” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, sensing he had encountered something grave.

“Ah! I remember now—Luo Tian, the elder master of our family. My god!” The youth and his companions seemed to see a ghost, their eyes rolling back as they fainted.

“What’s going on?” Luo Tian felt more puzzled. He reached for the youth’s head, and a Saint-level being was no match for him. With his strength, he could view the youth’s memories without harming him.

“Boom…” Seeing the youth’s memories, Luo Tian’s face turned pale.

Chapter 1842: Return to Longyin City

“Tianyuan Continent, Luo Family’s Second Elder Luo Li. Six million years ago, he lost the battle for Epoch Master and sat in meditation within the Five Elements Sect, cultivating as a准Epoch Master (near-Epoch Master).”

“Tianyuan Continent, Five Elements Sect’s Mountain-Quaking Elder, Poison Master Gu Lei, Xu Liziyi, Zheng Xin… All sat in meditation within the Five Elements Sect eight million years ago, cultivating as near-Epoch Masters.” Names flooded Luo Tian’s mind, his face pale like a sheet.

These were all his brothers and relatives. When he had ventured the immortal path, they had all left their methods to seal these people!

“This was when?” Luo Tian’s heart felt as if struck repeatedly. Blood spewed from his mouth, shattering countless stars with each expulsion.

“This…” The youths, upon regaining consciousness, were speechless at the scene. A single blood spurt had shattered a starry expanse—what an overwhelming cultivation!

“Go!” Luo Tian waved his hand, releasing the youths. He then pointed a finger, sending some energy into their bodies.

Luo Tian released the youths and immediately appeared on the Tianyuan Continent.

After ages of change, the Tianyuan Continent remained strong but no longer at its former peak. The Luo Family’s status there was also not as supreme.

Luo Tian ignored others and flew to the Five Elements Sect’s cemetery. Towering tombs appeared in his view.

“Moyao Wuhua, Dong Sansi’s position—follower of the First Elder…” Luo Tian walked past the first tomb, a smile on his face. He recalled meeting Dong Sansi when he first entered the Five Elements Sect.

“Luo Nantian, First Elder Luo Tian’s father… Luo Xiong…” Luo Tian trembled, gazing at the names on the tombs. Memories flooded his mind like a spring.

“Friends, relatives—gone. The world is lonely. What’s the point of continuing?” Luo Tian’s face bore bitterness, a deep sorrow rising within.

In the End Times Forest, Gu Qianxue’s face darkened. A sense of death seemed to emanate from Luo Tian, and his vitality was rapidly declining.

“Three-headed dog! Hurry and pick the Biyang Flower!” Gu Qianxue shouted at the three-headed dog. She had no time to explain, knowing the Biyang Flower’s danger.

“Grrr…” The three-headed dog also sensed Luo Tian’s abnormal state. It growled, its massive body stepping forward and appearing before the Biyang Flower in an instant. It bit down on the stem, yanking it out by force.

At the moment the Biyang Flower was uprooted, Luo Tian sat within a tomb, eyes closed, his aura reduced to the lowest.

“Buzz…” The sky inverted. In an instant, the surroundings twisted. Luo Tian opened his eyes, standing before the dried pool.

“What’s happening!” His face darkened. He felt his vitality rapidly fading and stopped immediately.

“A幻境 (illusion), the Biyang Flower’s illusion. It magnifies your deepest fears, trapping you within,” Gu Qianxue said, gazing at the Biyang Flower in the three-headed dog’s mouth.

“Huff…” At the same time, the memories Luo Tian had experienced flooded his mind. His face turned pale instantly.

“Terrifying! This illusion nearly deceived me!” Luo Tian wiped sweat from his face, gazing at the Biyang Flower in the three-headed dog’s mouth. He had believed his composure and experience would not be deceived, yet he had fallen for a flower’s trick.

“Buzz…” Gu Qianxue waved her sword, cutting off three petals. Black qi radiated from the petals.

Gu Qianxue quickly cast an incantation, storing the three petals. Then she said to Luo Tian: “Now we must part ways. I need a place to refine the Biyang Flower. As for the trial, you’ll go alone!”

“Fine,” Luo Tian understood Gu Qianxue’s current state. He could not persuade her.

“Grrr…” The three-headed dog growled, swallowing the Biyang Flower. At that moment, its aura surged abruptly, hinting at a breakthrough. Its silver eyes also gained depth and an unusual sharpness.

“Then I’ll go first! Take care, you…” Luo Tian spoke softly. He then led Long Youlan and the Howling Moon Sky Wolf King out of the End Times Forest.

“Farewell!” Gu Qianxue whispered, her figure rising and vanishing into the night.

“Truly terrifying!” Luo Tian felt a lingering fear. Though he had escaped the illusion, his heart was shaken.

“Though there’s no immediate problem, if it lasts too long, the events within the illusion may become real!” Luo Tian muttered. His eyes then hardened.

“Friends, relatives—wait for me. One day I’ll become a great immortal and reopen the immortal realm’s passage, returning to the Nine Realms to find you. I won’t let our parting become eternal!” Luo Tian muttered, his desire for strength now even greater. The immortal realm and the Nine Realms had different speeds; if he didn’t hurry, he might truly become eternal.

“Come on, girl. Go visit your family. You’ve missed home, right?” Luo Tian smiled, patting Long Youlan’s head.

“Mm!” Long Youlan nodded excitedly.

They safely exited the End Times Forest. The three-headed dog and Howling Moon Sky Wolf King returned to their normal size.

Within a day, Luo Tian and Long Youlan arrived at the outskirts of Longyin City. Long Youlan’s face bore excitement.

They stepped into Longyin City, heading directly toward the Governor’s Mansion.

“Is that Long Youlan?” Long Youlan was well-known in Longyin City, and people immediately recognized her.

“Hearing that Long Youlan joined the Heavenly Ghost Sect, there’s going to be a spectacle!” People whispered, gazing at Long Youlan.

“What happened?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow. Long Youlan clearly heard the whispers, her face changing slightly.

“Let’s go…” They didn’t hesitate and quickened their pace toward the Governor’s mansion.

Not long after, Luo Tian and Long Youlan stood before the Governor’s Mansion gates. Two youths in white robes blocked them, their faces cold as they scolded.

“The Governor’s Mansion is not receiving guests today. Leave,” they said coldly, their tone lofty.

“Do I need your permission to return to my home?” Long Youlan’s face turned cold. If she hadn’t known something was wrong, she would have lived in vain.

“Good! Capture her and send her over!” The two youths heard this and immediately reached for Long Youlan.

“Get lost…” Long Youlan sneered, drawing her sword. A flash of cold light appeared, and the youths’ hands were severed.

“Yelp…” Blood splattered. The two youths’ faces changed, their arms falling to the ground and twitching.

Long Youlan ignored their cries and stepped into the Governor’s Mansion. Her face turned grim upon seeing the chaos—bodies scattered everywhere, blood everywhere, a bloody scent filling Luo Tian and Long Youlan’s senses.

“Tianyi… Goudan…” Long Youlan instantly recognized the bodies on the ground as the Governor’s servants.

“…Sister…” A trembling voice echoed in Luo Tian and Long Youlan’s ears. A youth, no more than eleven or twelve years old, emerged from a broken house.

“Six!” Long Youlan instantly appeared before the youth.

“Sister, you’ve returned! Hurry and save the Governor! They’re to be executed today!” Six’s face lit up, his eyes glowing with light.

“What!” Hearing this, Long Youlan and Luo Tian had no time to think. They took off toward the city’s central square.

At that moment, a high platform held over a hundred people kneeling. Their bodies were wounded.

“Not only the Governor of Longli, but also four other city governors have been captured!” Below the platform, people stood in silence, their faces filled with sorrow.

“Unexpectedly, Longli’s Governor has unified the five cities. Yet he meets this fate. Never anger a sect!” People whispered.

“Longli, today is your death day. Is there anything you wish to say?” The middle-aged man on the platform glared at Longli.

“Blame yourself for associating with that beast!” The man’s face twisted with cruelty, shouting.

“My daughter and Luo Tian are in the Heavenly Ghost Sect. If you kill us, my daughter and Luo Tian will avenge me!” Longli smiled despite his wounds. His eyes held no fear.

“Regretful I didn’t enter the End Times Forest earlier. If I had, I might have saved my life! It’s my fault for disappointing you!” Luo Tian spoke to the group of people, including Zheng Tiande.

“Governor, how could you say that? Without the Governor, we wouldn’t be here today. We’ll die, but your sister will avenge us!” A rough man spoke, his eyes filled with resolve.

“You old bastard! You’ve no balls. If you dare to blink, I’ll never be your grandson. You old ox! May you die childless!” The man cursed, undeterred by the middle-aged man’s strength.

“Truly remarkable. I didn’t realize the Governor’s commander was so talented! Look at the sect elder of Zhenxian Sect—his face is green with rage!” People marveled at the man.

“Strip his skin off!” The middle-aged man’s face darkened. He ordered dozens of disciples before Longli.

“Hmph!” A disciple nodded respectfully, slapping the man and breaking his teeth.

“You’re a tough nut. I’ll see if your bones are tougher than my methods!” The youth’s face twisted with cruelty, drawing a sword and slicing from the man’s head to his abdomen.

“Will they really strip his skin?” Seeing this, people shivered.

The youth grabbed and tore. A scream echoed from the platform. The man was turned into a bloodied mess, and the youth held a bloody skin.

“Boom!” The bloodied man fainted. Some girls in the crowd screamed.

“Bring me salt!” The youth seemed unsatisfied, shouting to the crowd.

“Too cruel!” People trembled. At this moment, the youth seemed like a demon.

Not long after, a young disciple brought a bag of salt to the youth.

“Dare to insult our elder. You’re asking for death!” The youth’s face was cold, opening the salt bag.

The middle-aged man on the platform bore satisfaction. His anger slightly eased: “Insects! How dare you insult me.”

“Don’t, I’ll take it!” Longli shouted. He watched the youth sprinkle salt onto the bloodied man.

“Ah! I curse your ancestors!” The man’s scream mixed with curses echoed again.

“Enough. Kill them all!” The middle-aged man’s face bore impatience, ordering the disciples.

“Elder, trouble! Long Youlan has returned. She severed our arms and is now aware of us!” Two youths, whose arms had been cut off by Long Youlan and guarding the Governor’s Mansion, ran into the execution ground.

“What!” Hearing this, the elder’s face slightly changed. He gazed at the two youths: “Who is she with?”

“She came alone, and a young man. Please, Elder, help us reattach our arms!” The two youths’ faces were pale, their lifeless arms in hand.

“Haha! It’s the lady returning. Our lady is a disciple of the Heavenly Ghost Sect. You’ll all die!” Hearing this, people in the Governor’s Mansion brightened and laughed loudly.

“No need to reattach. Because now, you’ll all die!” Before the elder could speak, two cold auras descended from the sky. A golden sword fell from the heavens, piercing the youth’s head.

The golden spear plunged into the youth’s skull, pinning him in place. His eyes lost their light.

“Seal Soul!” Luo Tian flew into the air, extending his hand. Waves of energy radiated from the dead youth, gathering gray mist into his hands to form a ghostly figure with fear.

“Soul!” People gasped. Even the middle-aged elder was stunned, never having seen such a technique.

Seven-color flames erupted from Luo Tian’s hands, wrapping the soul and burning it relentlessly.

“You are Long Youlan? Then you are Luo Tian!” The middle-aged man suddenly stood, his eyes filled with hatred. He gazed at Luo Tian and Long Youlan in the sky.

“Correct!” Long Youlan looked at the over a hundred people on the platform, all wounded and some near death. Her eyes turned red.

Chapter 1843: Beheading
