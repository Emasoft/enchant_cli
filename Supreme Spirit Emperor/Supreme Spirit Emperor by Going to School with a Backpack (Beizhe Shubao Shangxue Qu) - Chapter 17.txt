The second chapter of "Seclusion"
Wuxia Sect, the back mountain of the Alchemy Hall, a dark cave.

"Yin and Yang, the Five Elements are the fundamental properties of heaven and earth, the basic building blocks of the world. However, there exist a few rare properties with astonishing power. For instance, your second elder brother's lightning attribute is renowned for its might and speed; your third elder brother's darkness attribute is famed for its mystery and stealth, especially in the night, where it is known as the king of darkness!" Zhang Ziping's calm voice echoed.

"What kind of cultivation base do you have, elder brother?" Luo Tian asked with curiosity.

"That is what I intend to teach you, elder brother. The Five Elements are in a cycle of generation and control. For example, your five-element base that generates the King's Seal, but what about control? Have you ever tried it?" Zhang Ziping continued.

"Five-element control!" Luo Tian muttered to himself, as if a veil had been lifted in his mind.

"Master, I am of water, wood, and metal elements!" After Zhang Ziping had let Luo Tian ponder for a while, he added.

"Water, wood, metal! Three-element base!" Luo Tian looked at Zhang Ziping, his face showing no surprise. He could himself be a Five-Element body, so it was not surprising that his elder brother had three elements. At thirty-something years old and at the Nascent Soul Realm, Luo Tian could not believe that without an exceptional cultivation base.

"Although I have a three-element base, look!" Zhang Ziping said and extended his hand. Blue, green, and golden spiritual energy flowed from his fingertips.

"A hum..." A beam of light rose from Zhang Ziping's fingertips, illuminating the entire cave and revealing his youthful face.

"Wow!" Luo Tian was stunned by Zhang Ziping's display.

Feeling the subtle spiritual energy fluctuations around him, Luo Tian could not believe his eyes. Zhang Ziping's three-element base clearly did not have the light element, yet he could sense the presence of light. This was obviously an additional element.

"Did you feel it? That is the subtlety of elements. Through the fusion of three elements, a light element emerges. In other words, although I have a three-element base, I can manifest the fourth element—light!" Zhang Ziping retracted his light and looked at Luo Tian.

"Control?" Luo Tian, confused, instinctively activated the water, wood, and metal elements within his body.

As Luo Tian's activation continued, the three elements in the cave fluctuated again. Luo Tian's face turned serious as the three elements slowly converged into his fingertips.

Zhang Ziping stood before Luo Tian, his gaze serious as he observed Luo Tian's performance. After all, Luo Tian was a Five-Element body, unlike himself who only had three elements. He dared not confirm whether Luo Tian could succeed.

However, Luo Tian felt unwell at this moment. The three elements, as they moved through his meridians toward his fingers, but Luo Tian forced the two conflicting elements to merge. This was against the principles of cultivation.

A series of sounds like firecrackers erupted from Luo Tian's body, and he panted heavily, collapsing onto the ground. His clothes were already torn to shreds.

"Be careful, grasp that critical point; only then can you succeed!" Zhang Ziping saw that Luo Tian was not seriously injured and whispered.

Luo Tian's lips curled into a smile. If Gu Lei and Gu Qianxue saw this, they would know that Luo Tian had returned to the reckless state he was in when he first refined the Dragon-Tiger Body-Refining Elixir.

"Boom..." For the next month, explosions continued to echo from the cave, and each day's sound grew louder, causing the disciples of the Alchemy Hall who passed by to be alarmed.

"Is the elder brother teaching his younger brother something? It's making such a racket!" Lei Yong and Ji Chen stood outside the cave, watching it with concern.

"Who knows? With the elder brother there, it should be fine!" Ji Chen coldly replied, but a hint of worry flickered in his eyes.

...

Time flew by, and another month passed. The explosion sounds still echoed daily from the cave, but this time they grew gradually quieter.

Lei Yong and Ji Chen remained outside the cave, observing the situation.

That day, the two were waiting idly for the explosion sound to occur but found that the sound had disappeared after two months.

"A hum..." A spiritual energy fluctuation emerged from the cave.

After the spiritual energy fluctuation, a brilliant light like the sun burst out of the cave, causing their eyes to ache painfully. Especially for Ji Chen, who had a darkness element, he instinctively disliked sunlight and felt slightly suppressed.

"Haha... Finally succeeded!" A loud laugh echoed, and two figures emerged from the cave under Lei Yong and Ji Chen's astonished gaze.

Seeing Zhang Ziping and Luo Tian, Lei Yong and Ji Chen's faces twitched. The two looked quite disheveled, even Zhang Ziping, who was usually calm, showed signs of fatigue and his clothes were somewhat torn.

"Elder brother, has the younger brother succeeded?" Lei Yong asked excitedly, unable to believe it. As Zhang Ziping's junior brother, he naturally knew that Zhang Ziping had been teaching Luo Tian something recently.

Zhang Ziping nodded slightly: "It's a small success. He should be able to perform Yellow-Grade Advanced Martial Arts! And he has also advanced to the Refining Body Stage Eight!"

Zhang Ziping looked at Luo Tian, his eyes showing satisfaction. Clearly, he was surprised that Luo Tian could not only fuse the light element within two months but also advance to Refining Body Stage Eight.

"Congratulations, younger brother!" Ji Chen said simply. Although light and darkness elements were conflicting, it was his younger brother who succeeded, so this was a different matter.

"Young master, isn't it time to celebrate?" Lei Yong rubbed his hands together and asked Luo Tian.

"Of course! Let's go, I'll treat you to a meal at Yan Yue Lou on the main peak!" Luo Tian replied cheerfully. Obviously, he was grateful for Lei Yong and Ji Chen's protection over these days and wasn't too stingy.

Yan Yue Lou was a restaurant on the main peak of Wuxia Sect, where top chefs from the secular world were specially invited. Some disciples found cultivation tedious or had a taste for food often visited Yan Yue Lou. With the sect master Wei Mingxuan as its backer, no one would dare to eat there without paying.

Lei Yong was a regular at Yan Yue Lou, and upon hearing Luo Tian's plan to treat them there, his mouth almost drooled.

"Imbecile!" The words came from Zhang Ziping and Ji Chen simultaneously.

"Ah... I can't help it, who's poor? I can't afford it!" Lei Yong ignored the three's disdain and whined about his poverty, which earned him three middle fingers.

"I won't go. You all go. By the way, Luo Tian, relax a bit. In the next month, you'll be busier!" Zhang Ziping said to Luo Tian.

Hearing Zhang Ziping's words, Lei Yong and Ji Chen looked at Luo Tian with sympathy.

Luo Tian felt a chill involuntarily upon seeing the three's gazes.

Chapter Seventy-Eight: Yan Yue Lou

Wuxia Sect, the main peak, Yan Yue Lou.

Yan Yue Lou was the only place in Wuxia Sect where one could enjoy a meal, so it naturally attracted a lot of customers.

Luo Tian, Gu Lei, and Ji Chen found a place to sit. As soon as they sat down, Gu Lei picked up the menu and started ordering dishes. Ji Chen was once again disdainful, while Luo Tian simply smiled without much reaction. As a alchemy master and one with considerable fame, Luo Tian had enough savings.

Not long after, all the dishes Gu Lei ordered were served, greatly exciting the three. Gu Lei was no stranger to Yan Yue Lou; every dish he ordered was a feast of color, aroma, and flavor.

"Haha, younger brother, try this earth dragon meat; it's good for your body! This is my favorite!" Gu Lei said, then grabbed his chopsticks and started eating heartily.

Luo Tian and Ji Chen also picked up their chopsticks, took a piece of earth dragon meat, and took a bite. A fresh fragrance filled their mouths, followed by pure spiritual energy flowing down their throats. Luo Tian felt his recently advanced Refining Body Stage Eight cultivation solidified further.

Even Ji Chen's composed personality was impressed by the earth dragon meat, and he ate faster. Lei Yong, on the other hand, didn't care at all, taking a bite from his left and another from his right. When he choked, he drank some wine beside him, causing the disciples at the adjacent table who had only ordered three dishes to envy.

"Luo Tian!" Gu Lei's unique loud voice rang out, causing the three to put down their chopsticks. Lei Yong frowned, obviously不满 with being interrupted during his meal, but when he saw Gu Lei's figure, his expression softened.

Luo Tian looked in the direction of the sound and saw four figures entering their line of sight. Gu Lei had slimmed down, but the three elegant figures beside him drew everyone's attention. It could only be Gu Qianxue, Ning Qingzhu, and Wang Yulan.

Seeing Gu Lei with the three, Luo Tian was momentarily stunned, then realized that Gu Lei had made some progress. He felt happy for Gu Lei.

"Luo Tian! Ji Chen! What are you doing here?" Gu Qianxue and Ning Qingzhu's voices rang out simultaneously, while Wang Yulan coldly looked around, silencing everyone.

"Just emerged from seclusion and came here with two elder brothers!" Luo Tian replied, while Ji Chen said nothing and ignored Ning Qingzhu's intense gaze.

"Coincidence! Come, sit down! You should know these three, right?" Gu Lei introduced Wang Yulan to the others.

Luo Tian naturally didn't refuse, and Lei Yong, this foodie, showed no reaction. Ji Chen's opinion was overlooked.

Gu Qianxue naturally sat beside Luo Tian, while Ning Qingzhu actively approached Ji Chen and sat down. Gu Lei also shamelessly sat in front of Wang Yulan.

"Ugh..." Lei Yong looked at the three young women and felt like he was the only old man, feeling a bit bewildered. However, with his usual broad-mindedness, he just coughed once and continued eating heartily.

"Luo Tian! How was your seclusion? What did you gain?" Gu Lei broke the silence first, asking.

"Yes! Two months of seclusion, you don't know how much we missed our sister Qianxue!" Ning Qingzhu's voice echoed, causing Gu Qianxue to blush again.

"Enough! Eat and then leave quickly!" Wang Yulan's cold voice rang out, immediately making the others feel awkward.

Wang Yulan was also somewhat uncomfortable. She had always been devoted to cultivation, but she didn't know why she was persuaded by Gu Qianxue and Ning Qingzhu to come eat here, especially with Gu Lei who had been chasing her for two months like a fly. This confused her.

Hearing Wang Yulan's scolding, Ji Chen and Gu Lei slightly frowned, obviously不满 with Wang Yulan's tone. The two had always been lawless, and no one could control them except their master and elder brother. However, due to their relationship with Luo Tian and the others, they didn't go too far.

"Ah! Qingzhu Senior Sister, it's such a coincidence to meet here!" Just as the group was silent, a sharp voice rang out.

The group sitting on the second floor looked towards the staircase and saw a young man with an apparently honest face followed by a group of youths approaching their table.

"Wang Dayong!" Seeing the visitor, Ning Qingzhu furrowed her brows and showed an expression of displeasure.

Luo Tian, Lei Yong, and Ji Chen also observed these youths. When they saw that all of them wore thick earth peak uniforms, their brows slightly furrowed.

The Alchemy Hall had, at the time of recruiting disciples, sealed thirty years of elixirs for Thick Earth Peak. This was well-known, and it had created a grudge between the two peaks.

Wang Dayong was surprised to see Lei Yong and Ji Chen, as his subordinates had reported that only Gu Lei was present, not knowing about the existence of Ji Chen and Lei Yong. However, out of face, Wang Dayong still approached their table with a smile.

"Wang Dayong! What are you doing here? Haven't you been rejected enough?" Ning Qingzhu frowned and looked at Wang Dayong approaching, but she didn't say anything harsh.

"Love is natural for everyone. I truly have feelings for Senior Sister Ning Qingzhu!" Wang Dayong smiled with a sycophantic expression and approached their table.

"I already have someone I like, and it's Ji Chen. This is well-known throughout the sect. So I advise you to give up this idea!" Ning Qingzhu didn't care that Ji Chen was nearby and boldly said, causing the entire second floor of Yan Yue Lou to focus on their table.

Ji Chen's eyes flickered slightly at Ning Qingzhu's words, but no one noticed. However, Luo Tian sensed it in that moment and thought to himself: "Third elder brother, you have something on your mind!"

"But Ji Chen Senior Brother doesn't like you. This is also well-known, right, Ji Chen Senior Brother!" Wang Dayong saw that the group didn't stop him from talking to Ning Qingzhu, so he became overconfident and said.

"Get out!" A cold voice rang out. After the voice, Ji Chen's eyes looked like a thunder in the night towards Wang Dayong.

"Ugh..." Wang Dayong felt as if he was being stared at by a lone wolf, like falling into a thousand-year cold pool. His skin prickled instantly and he was speechless under Ji Chen's gaze.

"Did you not hear me? I told you to leave!" A bone accompanied by a rolling thunder sound hit Wang Dayong's head. Lei Yong sat there picking his teeth, but his voice had also turned cold.

A red bump rose from Wang Dayong's head. A disciple of the Bone-Subjugation Stage was hit on the head with a bone, creating a large bump. This caused the surrounding disciples to laugh.

Chapter Seventy-Nine: All Enemies

Wang Dayong never expected that in Yan Yue Lou, Lei Yong would still dare to act. He was stunned by Lei Yong and Ji Chen's actions, and for a moment he stood there in shock.

"Still not leaving? Do you want me to help you leave?" Lei Yong's voice rang out again, sounding playful as he looked at Wang Dayong.

Although Lei Yong often joked with Ji Chen, it didn't mean their relationship was bad; on the contrary, their relationship was very good. Even Luo Tian and Zhang Ziping were not as close.

Seeing Wang Dayong being overconfident, who knew Ji Chen better than Lei Yong? He couldn't allow it. He stood up and slowly approached Wang Dayong.

"Senior Brother Lei, don't rush. I'll leave!" Wang Dayong felt委屈 but was defeated in skill and could only grit his teeth, bowing to the group and heading downstairs. He knew he couldn't handle them.

As Wang Dayong and his people left, the second floor of Yan Yue Lou returned to peace. The group continued eating, and after the incident, their atmosphere had eased somewhat, especially Ning Qingzhu, whose eyes were full of stars looking at Ji Chen. This made Wang Yulan scold her for being a lovesick fool, causing everyone to laugh.

While the group was eating and drinking, a solemn voice echoed in their ears, or rather, throughout the Wuxia Sect.

"Any disciple of the Wuxia Sect, whether outer or inner, or direct disciples, can now challenge Luo Tian of the Alchemy Hall. If someone defeats Luo Tian, I will reward them with a Five-Star Elixir or a Yellow-Grade Advanced Martial Art!" Zhang Ziping's calm voice echoed throughout the Wuxia Sect.

"Haha, younger brother, your miserable days have begun!" Lei Yong shouted loudly.

Ji Chen and Ning Qingzhu, as well as Wang Yulan, also looked at Luo Tian with sympathy. Obviously, they knew what Zhang Ziping meant.

Luo Tian heard Zhang Ziping's words and was clearly stunned, but after seeing the pitying looks of the others, he understood what Zhang Ziping meant.

"Of course, not everyone can challenge. It's limited to the Refining Body Stage. Whether you are at the early, middle, or late stage of Bone-Subjugation, even if you reach the peak, as long as you self-restrict your cultivation to Refining Body Stage, you can challenge him. The time starts now, and the location is不限!" Zhang Ziping's voice rang out again, adding.

"Alright, younger brother, you'll be very busy in the next month! Haha!" Lei Yong laughed loudly, obviously taking pleasure in Luo Tian's misfortune.

"Senior Sister Yulan, what does Zhang Senior Brother mean?" Gu Lei asked Wang Yulan with a flirty face.

"Zhang Ziping is really good at training his younger brother. He believes that his younger brother should be the strongest in the same stage, so he came up with this method to train his younger brother. Of course, he himself did the same." Wang Yulan explained, but she was looking at the confused Gu Qianxue.

"With such a generous reward, does that mean Luo Tian is now the enemy of all disciples in the Wuxia Sect?" Gu Lei understood the explanation and cast a pitiful gaze toward Luo Tian.

"Yes, think about how I felt back then. Oh, it's unforgettable for life! Right, third elder brother!" Lei Yong said with nostalgia.

Ji Chen's eyes also showed some emotion and nodded.

...

Not long after Zhang Ziping's words, a huge uproar spread throughout the Wuxia Sect. Everyone knew that Zhang Ziping had started giving his younger brother another challenge.

At Thick Earth Peak, Yang Huan Yu was surrounded by gray energy and smiled faintly: "The Refining Body Stage is just the initial stage. Wait until you reach Bone-Subjugation to meet him!"

At Blazing Fire Peak, the head of Water Moon Peak and the head of Blazing Fire Peak looked at a youth in front of them, who had red and blue colors flickering: "It's this Alchemy Hall Luo Tian again. This kid has been famous since the day he was recruited, and these days my ears are worn out!"

"Indeed. Let Qianyu also fight him. After all, with Qianyu's nature, the stronger the opponent, the faster his cultivation advances!"

Feng Qianyu heard their conversation and his body trembled. His Refining Body Stage Nine energy spread out, and he growled lowly: "Luo Tian, finally I can fight you!"

At the back of Gold Light Peak, Zhang Hongyun stood behind the peak master Liu Anran, his face full of respect.

Liu Anran folded his hands behind his back and looked at Zhang Hongyun, who had just joined for two months, with a kind expression. He asked gently: "Why do you want to fight?"

"Indeed, I wish to challenge. Also, I want to see how much progress other peers have made!" Zhang Hongyun bowed and replied.

"Your cultivation has improved greatly these months, so it's time to test it. Cultivation is mainly about cultivating the mind; don't be too concerned with winning or losing. Zhang Ziping wants to train his younger brother by using the talents from other peaks. This is an extreme method, only the Alchemy Hall's head family would dare to train their disciples this way. Go ahead and gain some experience, but remember, the Refining Body Stage is just the first stage of cultivation. Only when you reach the Nascent Soul Realm will you discover a different world!" Liu Anran's calm voice echoed.

"Yes, I understand!" Zhang Hongyun replied and his eyes showed a flicker of battle spirit. His figure vanished from Gold Light Peak.

At Green Wood Peak, Pei Letian's face showed a sinister smile: "Kid, this time who can save you? I'll let Gu Qianxue know how bad her judgment is!"

At the same time, disciples from all peaks were eager to find Luo Tian. For such a generous reward, no one was untouched. Even some outer disciples at the Bone-Subjugation Stage Initial could be tempted, but they were too embarrassed to self-restrict their cultivation.

However, some veteran disciples stepped out of their caves, and even some disciples who had been contemporaries with Zhang Ziping also emerged from their seclusion caves to see what the fourth disciple of the Alchemy Hall was like.

"Is this your fourth disciple? I wonder how much better he is than me. Ah... when he reaches the Bone-Subjugation Stage, I'll show you that I'm not inferior to any genius!" At Water Moon Peak, a disciple in white clothes looked at the Alchemy Hall with electric eyes.

"Ji Yunhai!" If Lei Yong and Ji Chen saw this person, they would recognize him. This was the disciple who had kneeled outside the Alchemy Hall for three days and nights to beg the head of the Alchemy Hall to accept him as a disciple but was rejected. Eventually, he was taken in by Water Moon Peak.

But every time the old head of the Alchemy Hall took disciples, he would come to challenge. Lei Yong and Ji Chen had fought with him for a long time before finally winning.

"Ah... I don't know how many disciples the Alchemy Hall will step on this time, but so far no one has appeared. However, the quality of this year's disciples is quite good. I hope someone can succeed!" Wei Mingxuan sat on the main peak, smiling and muttering to himself.

Wei Mingxuan didn't know that the person who had stirred up the Wuxia Sect again was currently eating at his mountain peak's Yan Yue Lou.

Chapter Eighty: Genius Attack

"Young master, eat more; fill your stomach to have the strength to fight!" Lei Yong cheerfully comforted Luo Tian.

Luo Tian picked up a cup of wine on the table and drank it in one go, his face showing intense battle spirit: "Since it's my elder brother's training, then let's go. I'm not afraid of anyone in the Refining Body Stage now!"

"Haha, that's our kind of character. Invincible in the same stage; if anyone doesn't agree, just knock them down!" Lei Yong was quite pleased and patted Luo Tian's shoulder.

"Brother, you can do it!" Gu Lei also patted Luo Tian's shoulder.

Others also gave Luo Tian encouraging glances, including Wang Yulan, who rarely looked at him with encouragement.

"Thick Earth Peak's Lang Yueping respectfully requests to fight with Young Master Luo!" Just as the group was eating, a voice rang out. A group of people climbed up the stairs, clearly those who had just left.

Wang Dayong was scolded by Lei Yong and Ji Chen, feeling委屈. On his way back to Thick Earth Peak, he heard Zhang Ziping's voice and bit his lip: "Lei Yong and Ji Chen I can't beat, but I don't believe I can't control your younger brother!"

Wang Dayong then led his group back to Yan Yue Lou.

Lei Yong saw Wang Dayong returning and frowned: "Why are you back again?"

"Haha, Senior Brother Lei, Master Zhang said anyone can challenge Young Master Luo. This time my senior brother Lang Yueping has just broken through to Refining Body Stage Nine and wants to test his strength. It's convenient, so he came back!" Wang Dayong said with a smug expression.

"Hmph, who doesn't know that Lang Yueping has been at Refining Body Stage Nine for several months? Well, since you've come to challenge, then let's go. Since we dared to make the statement, we aren't afraid. Young Master, teach these troublemakers a lesson!" Lei Yong said to Luo Tian, obviously disliking these Thick Earth Peak disciples.

"Ah!" Luo Tian simply nodded and observed the first challenger.

The surrounding onlookers all showed excitement, obviously excited that someone had challenged immediately after Zhang Ziping's statement. Especially the disciples from Thick Earth Peak, who had a grudge with the Alchemy Hall, all looked forward to watching.

"Come on, let's go to the Five Elements Arena. Do you want to fight here?" Lei Yong waved impatiently, as if shooing a fly.

Seeing Lei Yong's attitude, Wang Dayong didn't get angry but greeted Ning Qingzhu and then left with his group.

"Alright, let's go see the fun too," Ning Qingzhu asked Wang Yulan for her opinion and, after getting her approval, pulled Ji Chen out.

The group slowly made their way to the location of the Five Elements Arena.

As they were famous figures in the Wuxia Sect, they naturally attracted a lot of attention. Especially since Luo Tian was now the symbol of Five-Star Elixirs and Yellow-Grade Advanced Martial Arts. Whoever defeated him could obtain them.

Soon, the news of the group going to the Five Elements Arena spread.

The Five Elements Arena was a place specifically prepared by the Wuxia Sect for disciples to compete. The arena was vast, and outside it had a barrier array that could withstand even the attacks of Bone-Subjugation Stage Peak. Thus, people watching were safe.

At this moment, Lang Yueping stood on the Five Elements Arena's platform like a mountain. Lang Yueping was somewhat famous in the Wuxia Sect. Some idle disciples had compiled a list of Refining Body Stage disciples, and Lang Yueping was ranked eighty-first.

Though it was only eighty-first place, the Wuxia Sect was vast; even one peak had tens of thousands of disciples. How many disciples were there in total across all peaks? To be ranked eighty-first, Lang Yueping was clearly a genius of Thick Earth Peak.

Luo Tian and the group slowly arrived at the Five Elements Arena, looking at the crowd that had already filled the place. Luo Tian's lips slightly curled, and others were also shocked.

"Wow, this person is no less than the day he was recruited!" Gu Lei looked at the people coming and going, also surprised.

Wang Yulan, who usually disliked gatherings, slightly furrowed her brows but remained cold-faced and walked behind the group.

"Luo Tian has arrived!" Someone in the crowd shouted, and since the group was so noticeable, immediately all eyes focused on them.

"Look, it's Senior Brother Lei and Senior Brother Ji!" The crowd murmured.

"I'm going to see, even the Ice Mountain of Green Wood Peak, Wang Yulan Senior Sister has come? I remember the last time I saw her was during the sect's grand competition. The one beside her is Senior Sister Ning, and that should be Gu Qianxue. They are all very beautiful!" Some disciples were instantly conquered by the three women and whispered lowly.

The group walked forward, and people naturally parted to let them through without anyone complaining. Not only was it Lei Yong and Ji Chen, but even Wang Yulan's icy presence made people not dare to provoke.

"Hmph! Let them be embarrassed and humiliated. Lang Yueping, teach that kid a lesson. If this first battle is lost, I don't know where to put the faces of Lei Yong and others!" Wang Dayong sneered, speaking softly to Lang Yueping on the platform.

"Only Refining Body Stage Eight! Even if it's a Five-Element body, it won't be my opponent!" Lang Yueping confidently replied.

Luo Tian looked at the confident Lang Yueping and stretched his body, jumping onto the platform with an unrepentant expression: "Please teach me!"

As Luo Tian stepped onto the platform, a wave of cheers erupted from the crowd. After all, Luo Tian had become famous recently and was an alchemy master, naturally gaining many supporters.

Looking around at the cheers, Lang Yueping chuckled softly: "Please be gentle with me!"

However, as soon as the words were spoken, Lang Yueping's body rushed toward Luo Tian like a human beast, clearly displaying his Refining Body Stage Nine cultivation.

Luo Tian saw Lang Yueping rushing toward him and smiled lightly. He had already been able to withstand a Refining Body Stage Nine peak disciple,裴乐天, when he was at Refining Body Stage Seven. As for Lang Yueping, Luo Tian naturally wasn't afraid but also ran toward him with the same determination.

"Does this Luo Tian want to die? He's actually daring to fight a Refining Body Stage Nine disciple without using any martial arts!" The crowd murmured.

"Kid, don't you know that the disciples of Thick Earth Peak are most skilled in body strength training?" Wang Dayong sneered.

"Wang Dayong, don't be too confident. The result will show!" Lei Yong folded his arms and watched the scene with interest.

Seeing Lei Yong's calmness, Wang Dayong felt an inexplicable bad feeling.

Chapter Eighty-One: Battle, Battle, Battle

"Boom..." A thunderous sound echoed, as if a deep rumble had sounded in the overcast sky.

Cracks formed under Luo Tian and Lang Yueping's feet, but they quickly returned to normal. Both stepped back simultaneously.

"Good!" The crowd watching cheered, obviously excited by the fight using the most primitive method, which made them feel热血.

"Surprisingly, he could withstand me! Although I used eight-tenths of my strength, it's still not something a Refining Body Stage disciple can endure! What is this kid made of? He's only at Refining Body Stage Eight!" Lang Yueping was internally shocked, shaking his slightly numb body.

Luo Tian was also astonished, secretly praising that Thick Earth Peak indeed had an incredible understanding of body strength. Combined with the earth element, it was comparable to a ferocious beast's body.

"Full strength this time! See how you handle it!" Lang Yueping gritted his teeth, and brown earth element spiritual energy flowed through his body. He pushed off the ground with his feet and rushed toward Luo Tian again.

"I guess I have to use full strength too!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a slight seriousness, and spiritual energy of the five elements subtly flowed within his body. The five elements generated each other, finally settling on earth element, and a heavy atmosphere radiated from Luo Tian.

"Boom..." Another thunderous sound echoed in the ears of the people.

However, this time there was no more evenly matched results. Under the amazed gaze of the crowd, Lang Yueping flew toward Wang Dayong like a kite with a broken string.

"Ah..." A series of gasps echoed, and people looked at Luo Tian in disbelief, as if looking at a monster.
