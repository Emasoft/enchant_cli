“Luo Tian, let me go… Ah…” A desperate cry rose through the skies of Broken God Cliff, echoing like a beast’s wailing.

“Let you go? My disciples of the Four Sacred Star Domain Xuanwu Sect will never let me go!” The cold voice sent shivers down the spine. Above, Li Jinglong’s living soul was forcibly torn from Luo Tian, his physical body discarded onto the ground. Emerald-green flames continuously scorched the living soul, screaming bitterly.

Luo Tian slowly landed on the ground, his face still grim. He bowed to the Xuanwu Elder Tortoise: “Apologies, elder, I’ve returned late!”

Luo Tian was consumed by guilt, cursing himself for lingering too long in the Flame Domain. This had led to Xuanwu Sect’s downfall—everything stemmed from his failure.

“No need for guilt; if the sect’s strength was insufficient, it would inevitably fall,” the Xuanwu Elder Tortoise said, his voice heavy with age.

“Let’s go—this Broken God Cliff is no place for lingering!” Luo Tian waved his hand, gathering the Thunder Sect’s dozens of disciples. With a flick, he and the group vanished from Broken God Cliff.

Once safely beyond the cliff, Luo Tian exhaled deeply, his gaze turning to the familiar Four Sacred Star Domain. Yet the domain radiated a warlike aura, prompting his brow to furrow.

“Days ago, the Four Sacred Star Domain received news of you. When they learned your power was so immense, the entire domain erupted in excitement. After all, the Four Sacred Star Domain had languished for countless epochs; your strength now signals its revival.”

“But soon after, disaster struck. The Thunder Sect didn’t seek to occupy the Four Sacred Star Domain—it aimed to annihilate it entirely.”

“Though our domain has surged in strength these days, we still lack the might to match the Thunder Sect. Xuanwu Sect’s destruction was merely the beginning. A flood of Thunder Sect elites poured into the Four Sacred Star Domain, slaughtering its sects. The entire domain plunged into chaos.”

At that moment, the Tianyuan Continent rallied all sects to its vicinity, halting the Four Sacred Star Domain’s destruction.

The Xuanwu Elder Tortoise sighed as he recounted these events to Luo Tian and the others.

“Thunder Sect!” Luo Tian clenched his fists, the sound of cracking echoing from them. His body radiated a dangerous aura, his gaze dark and resolute.

“I had planned to head to the Tianyuan Continent, but the Thunder Sect surrounded it entirely. I couldn’t leave. Now even the Tianyuan Continent is perilous.” The Xuanwu Elder Tortoise’s face bore worry.

“Revenge! Kill!” Chen Xuanning’s eyes burned crimson, his body glowing with radiant light. He lunged at the Thunder Sect disciples suspended in midair, as if mad.

“Alas…” Luo Tian and the others sighed deeply, watching Chen Xuanning’s bloodthirsty rage without stopping him.

Luo Tian had let the captives live to let Chen Xuanning vent—knowing his nature, a benevolent man who always counseled others to forgive. Before this, Chen Xuanning had never killed.

But with the sect’s destruction, his blow was devastating. If he didn’t vent, something might go wrong. Killing was the best release—especially for his sworn enemies—to fully restore him, else it would become a lifelong obsession.

“Kill… kill… kill…” Chen Xuanning raged, seizing Nangong Yuching’s blood-red long sword. He slashed wildly at the dozen Thunder Sect disciples, his movements unrefined but relentless. The sect’s superiors and even those reduced to half-Saint level were hacked into meat paste, until he finally stopped, panting heavily.

“Enough. No sect endures forever. As long as you and I remain, Xuanwu Sect’s lineage won’t break. It will recover slowly,” the Xuanwu Elder Tortoise said, his voice entering Chen Xuanning’s ears.

The group sighed deeply but pressed on toward the Tianyuan Continent. Fortunately, Luo Tian’s current Saint-level cultivation allowed them to reach it in a day—but they dared not slow.

Along the way, they slaughtered hundreds of Thunder Sect elites, all at super-ordinary level.

Just as the group had covered half the journey, two familiar yet battered figures reappeared in their sight.

Chapter 1026: Disciple ( )

The Four Sacred Star Domain was engulfed in relentless battles. The Thunder Sect’s large-scale invasion had left it unprepared, its air thick with blood and dread.

Luo Tian and his group moved through the domain, slaying countless Thunder Sect elites. As they neared the Tianyuan Continent, two young figures emerged in their view, causing Luo Tian’s brow to furrow.

Before them stood a boy and girl, their faces still youthful but their qi fierce. Despite facing several super-ordinary-level elites, they showed no fear. Their movements were battered but dominated the opponents.

Especially the boy with a sword-brow, his aura roiling as he unleashed a series of seals. A purple long spear materialized in his grip, flawlessly executed.

“Human King Seal? Opening Heaven Seal? How could this youth know these?” Xu Liyi and others paused, their eyes filled with confusion.

Luo Tian halted without attacking, watching the boy and girl with interest.

“Who are these two to you, Luo Tian? Hmph, this Human King Seal is better than yours! And that spear technique—almost identical to your own!” The group approached, their faces curious.

“Haha, these two little ones have grown so much!” Luo Tian’s face softened, though a hint of regret lingered.

“Indeed, their talent is remarkable. At such an age, they’ve reached super-ordinary level—just like Luo Tian back then!” Zheng Xin marveled, her gaze scanning the boy and girl’s martial arts.

The group recognized Luo Tian’s connection to the pair, eager to test their strength.

“该死的，这丫头也不错，资质没得说。我说 Luo Tian, 这两个孩子不会是你哪个私生子吧？不对，那个男孩倒是像你生的，毕竟你长这么难看，那男孩也普通，但那个丫头挺可爱的啊，绝对不是你的！” Zheng Xin and the others, like gossip hounds, began speculating.

“Move! That bastard’s my disciple!” Luo Tian kicked Zheng Xin away, his face softening.

He had already contacted Gu Qianxue and others—Tianyuan Continent was safe for now. The Thunder Sect had halted its attack, allowing Luo Tian to slow down. Coincidentally, he encountered Dong Yichen and Dong Yan’er—unforeseen.

“Boom…” In their view, Dong Yichen closely resembled Luo Tian. Even alone against several super-ordinary elites, his face showed no fear. His qi surged, embodying a second Luo Tian. Super-ordinary power coalesced into “Sealing Heaven’s Seven Steps,” each step sending a Thunder Sect elite gushing blood.

“Unbeatable! If nurtured properly, he’ll be the next you!” The group marveled, surprised by Luo Tian’s disciples’ might.

“You’re all villains!” Dong Yan’er’s face bore indignation, her small hands striking repeatedly. Each strike echoed with waves of power. Even Luo Tian was moved—how could such a tiny body hold such terrifying energy?

“Pf!” The pair felled the Thunder Sect elites within an hour, their bodies pierced and lifeless.

“I’ll test this kid!” Zheng Xin, now at Saint-level early stage, felt restless. He revealed his form, a grin on his face as he confronted Dong Yichen and Yan’er.

“Damn it, Zheng Xin, do you have any shame!” Wan Lingkong and others cursed.

“Who are you?” Dong Yichen, sensing Zheng Xin’s strength, showed concern. His purple spear was at the ready, instinctively shielding Yan’er behind him.

“Hmph, who I am doesn’t matter. What matters is today I’m in the mood to take your lives!” Zheng Xin, playing the villain, sneered at the pair.

“Damn, this Zheng Xin’s acting so real!” The group admired his performance.

“Why do I feel like I’ve met you before?” Dong Yan’er looked at Zheng Xin, her face puzzled. Her eyes shone with clarity.

“Familiar? Today I’m here to take your lives!” Zheng Xin’s face darkened, his hammer vibrating with a hum. He swung it, as if shattering the stars, charging at Dong Yichen.

“Saint-level early stage? What’s so special about that? My master defeated Saint-level elites even at half-Saint level. I’ll test it!” Dong Yichen’s face burned with battle lust, his body echoing waves of power.

“Good kid! Who’s your master?” Zheng Xin smiled, asking as he swung his hammer at Dong Yichen. He held back, only testing super-ordinary limits.

“Luo Tian!” Dong Yichen’s face bloomed with pride, his spear clutched tightly. He met Zheng Xin’s hammer without fear.

“Crack!” Purple lightning sparked between the spear and hammer, radiating into space.

Dong Yichen’s body plummeted hundreds of feet before halting, his face lit with excitement.

“Saint-level early stage truly is strong! In the Four Sacred Star Domain, no super-ordinary can match us. Now facing a Saint-level early stage—this is unexpected!” Dong Yichen’s eyes gleamed, wiping blood from his lips. He transformed into a purple dragon, charging at Zheng Xin again.

“Kid, your master Luo Tian couldn’t even beat me. You’re nothing. Step aside; I’ll spare you for Luo Tian’s sake!” Zheng Xin smiled, addressing Dong Yichen.

“Haha! You think you’re his match? What are you, anyway? Today we’ll show you there’s always a mountain beyond the mountain!” Dong Yichen laughed, his spear flashing like lightning toward Zheng Xin.

“You’re a villain! You hurt my brother!” Dong Yan’er’s face flushed with anger, especially when Zheng Xin belittled Luo Tian. Her red ribbons sprang to life, slithering toward Zheng Xin like serpents.

“Purple Qi Eastward!” Dong Yichen’s face grew solemn; though confident, he knew Saint-level early stage was formidable. He unleashed his ultimate technique.

Purple spear shadows darkened the sky, enveloping Zheng Xin. His face paled—this strike could threaten him.

“Luo Tian’s disciples aren’t simple! They’ve had great opportunities. This spear technique could even wound a Saint-level early stage!” Nan Gong Yuching marveled, stunned. A super-ordinary’s technique could threaten a Saint-level—this proved Dong Yichen’s talent.

“Kill! Dance the Nine Heavens!” Dong Yan’er danced like a spirit, her red ribbons swirling into storms that engulfed Zheng Xin.

“Damn!” Zheng Xin’s face twisted, regretting testing Luo Tian’s disciples. Though he could easily defeat them, it would harm the kids. If they met again, his face would be ruined.

Reluctantly, Zheng Xin swung his hammer, barely fending off the siblings’ attacks. But ordinary strikes couldn’t withstand such prodigies.

Soon, Zheng Xin was overwhelmed by their martial arts, his body cracking with each strike.

After the storm, Zheng Xin’s face twisted in pain as he stared at the siblings, his face bitter. He regretted testing Luo Tian’s disciples.

The group laughed heartily, cursing him silently for daring to provoke children.

“Little brats!” Zheng Xin’s anger flared, his gaze at the siblings—unaware they were about to kill him.

“Kill!” The siblings attacked again, their strikes fiercer.

“Haha…” Just as the siblings prepared to move, a child’s voice rang out—clear and childish.

“Bad man! You hurt my big brother and sister!” The voice was muffled, fragmented.

Before Zheng Xin could react, a small white hand shot from the void, slapping his face.

A red palm print marked Zheng Xin’s cheek—no real harm, but humiliation. The hand’s small size indicated the owner was no older than a few years.

“Ah… it hurts…” The child’s voice echoed, crying out in pain.

But instantly, another white foot shot from the void, stomping Zheng Xin’s head. It vanished in a flash, leaving even Zheng Xin stunned.

“What the hell?” Wan Lingkong and others were baffled. They felt no one in the void, yet Zheng Xin’s palm print proved otherwise.

Luo Tian’s brow furrowed, his eyes flashing purple as he gazed into the void. But his frown deepened—his Purple Demon Eyes saw five tiny figures darting through the void, unimpeded.

“Luo Li, come out! This old man can’t hurt us!” Dong Yichen called into the void.

“Hmm, this adult’s too painful!” The child’s voice echoed again as four or five young figures emerged.

Zheng Xin’s face darkened—children, most he recognized.

“What…” Luo Tian was stunned, his eyes wide.

Four children, no taller than three feet, stood before them. The leader was a girl with twin braids, holding a toddler sucking a nipple. Two boys flanked her, hugging each other like bodyguards, occasionally sniffling with hostility.

“Why are you out?” Dong Yichen smiled, pulling the kids behind him.

“We came to find you! Mom was worried you’d be blocked by bad guys, so I’m here to fetch you!” The child’s voice was muffled, his chest puffed proudly.

“Big brother, is this a bad guy? I’ll kill him to make you feel better!” One boy brandished a hammer, taller than himself. He lunged at Zheng Xin.

“Damn it, little brat!” Zheng Xin cursed, seeing the boy was his son, Zheng Tianyao.

“Damn it, I’m your father!” Zheng Xin wanted to shout but felt embarrassed. His son had reached the Realm-Transcendent stage—such talent was undeniable.

“Why are you so bold? You’re a Realm-Transcendent but fighting a Saint-level! What’s your courage?” Zheng Xin was angry, determined to teach the kid a lesson. Otherwise, he’d suffer later.

“Tianyao, be careful…” Dong Yichen moved to stop Zheng Tianyao but was pulled back by the braided girl.

“Yi Chen, don’t worry! Tianyao’s fine!” The girl smiled slyly, winking at Luo Tian’s group.

“Such a brat…” The group smiled but Luo Tian was puzzled.

His bloodline power stirred, and he recognized the braided girl—Luo Xiting, who used to cling to him.

“These kids are truly prodigies! Years later, they’ve this strength—have we grown old?” Wan Lingkong shook his head, recognizing the kids.

“Luo Li!” Luo Tian trembled as he saw the toddler still sucking a nipple, his eyes unable to tear away.

“Haha, when we left the Four Sacred Star Domain, we knew Gu Qianxue was pregnant!” Wan Lingkong smiled, patting Luo Tian’s shoulder.

“See that kid flying toward Zheng Xin? That’s Zheng Xin’s son, Zheng Tianyao! A son attacking his father—first time I’ve seen this!”

“Another kid is Gu Lei’s son, Gu Guanyu… but strange, why is your son so small? He should be older, yet looks like a child!” Wan Lingkong’s face showed confusion.

Luo Tian sighed, gazing at Luo Xiting and Luo Li, his face showing regret. He’d been away for days, leaving Gu Qianxue and the others to suffer with their children.

Yet he felt relief—his twins were gifted, their talent undeniable. The hand that slapped Zheng Xin was Luo Li’s, and Luo Xiting’s ability to sense their presence surprised him.

“Crack!” A clear sound echoed, drawing everyone’s gaze to the father-son battle. Their mouths twitched.

Zheng Xin’s face was grim, avoiding full force to protect the kids. He grabbed Zheng Tianyao and smacked his butt.

“Little brat! Daring to attack me? You’ve gone mad!” The hand landed on Zheng Tianyao’s butt, a clear sound.

“Smack…” Zheng Tianyao’s face turned red, writhing in his father’s grip.

“Tianyao, hit his left leg!” Luo Xiting instructed Zheng Tianyao.

“Guanyu, you too! Yi Chen, you too!” Luo Xiting’s face was mischievous as she directed the others.

“Smack…!” Zheng Tianyao struck first, mercilessly smashing Zheng Xin’s left leg.

Zheng Xin was stunned—his left leg was his weakness, but he reflexively lifted it.

But instantly, Guanyu’s attack came, their timing perfect. Zheng Xin didn’t want to harm the kids and released Zheng Tianyao, intercepting Guanyu’s strike. His left hand lightly flicked, sending Guanyu flying back.

But a flash of purple light—Luo Yi Chen’s spear pierced Zheng Xin’s right shoulder.

“Pf…” Blood stained the spear, though not deep. Zheng Xin winced.

Luo Yi Chen retreated instantly, returning to the kids. Dong Yan’er joined him.

The children’s childish voices echoed in space, their movements practiced as they followed Luo Xiting’s orders. They found Zheng Xin’s weaknesses, though unable to harm him—yet they tormented him endlessly.

“Damn it…” Zheng Xin wanted to reveal his identity but couldn’t. Being so embarrassed by kids was humiliating, especially with his son.

And whether Luo Xiting planned it or Zheng Tianyao overperformed, the kid’s attacks always hit Zheng Xin, causing him to spit blood.

“He’s bleeding! He’s hurt! Brothers and sisters, fight harder!” Luo Li, still sucking his nipple, cheered, eyes gleaming as he darted into the void.

“Monsters! Truly monsters! Zheng Xin, mourn for a minute—this is deserved! Mocking your own kids!” Wan Lingkong and others watched without revealing, their faces impressed.

“Powerful! A spiritual body so strong it finds enemies’ weaknesses!” Nan Gong Yuching marveled, watching Luo Xiting’s calm command.

“These kids aren’t simple. If they grow up, they’ll be prodigies—perhaps even more monstrous than Luo Tian!” The Xuanwu Elder Tortoise sighed, his face full of affection.

Luo Tian smiled, satisfied with the kids’ performance. Watching Zheng Xin’s battered body, he straightened his face.

“Return!”

Luo Xiting observed Luo Tian’s direction, sensing his father’s intent. She called to the group.

Chapter 1028: Father and Son Reunited

The Four Sacred Star Domain—Luo Tian, Nan Gong Yuching, and Wan Lingkong smiled as they stood in space, their faces indulgent. They grabbed Zheng Xin, who was battered beyond recognition—his body marked by hammer and palm prints, with punctures from Luo Yi Chen’s spear.

“Return!” Luo Xiting’s small face held mischief as she addressed the group. Though not yet grown, she commanded a child-king aura. Even Luo Yi Chen and Yan’er retreated obediently.

“Cough… cough…” Zheng Xin entered their presence, his face bitter. He was truly battered—his body marked by hammer and palm prints, with punctures from Luo Yi Chen’s spear.

“Ah! Is this the Saint-level early stage Zheng Xin? How did you end up like this?” Wan Lingkong smiled, patting Zheng Xin’s shoulder.

Luo Tian and the others laughed heartily, recalling how Zheng Xin had been beaten by his own son.

“Damn it, what kind of creatures are these?” Zheng Xin cursed.

But his neck felt a sudden chill—Luo Tian’s cold gaze, eyes brimming with danger. Zheng Xin shrank back.

“Haha… these kids are truly monsters!” Zheng Xin chuckled nervously, trying to laugh it off.

“Old ones bullied me; now young ones do too. I must find a way!” Zheng Xin quickly composed himself, knowing he’d face the kids soon. If they discovered he was beaten by them, how could he hold his head high?

After fixing his attire, Zheng Xin eyed his son Zheng Tianyao and Luo Xiting’s group, as if contemplating something.

But despite his injuries healing quickly, some bruises remained.

“Xiting!” Luo Tian smiled, leading the group to appear before the children. The kids were startled.

The others hadn’t noticed Luo Tian’s group until now, still discussing why the “bad guy” vanished. Now they materialized out of nowhere.

“Ah… another bad guy!” Luo Li cried, then vanished into the void with the kids.

“Luo Li! Come out—no harm, it’s your father!” Luo Xiting’s voice echoed.

“Master? Uncle?” The kids’ voices trembled with excitement and confusion.

“Hmph, what father? I’ve never seen him! They say he’s strong, but I don’t believe it. If you catch me, I’ll admit you’re my father!” Luo Li’s voice echoed from the void.

“Hey, is this your son? So small yet moving in the void like it’s his home!” Zheng Xin marveled, unaware of Luo Li’s presence. He’d been tricked by the kid before.

“Father… your face is swollen!” Zheng Tianyao noticed Zheng Xin’s bruises, his temper flaring. He brandished a green hammer.

“Who hit you? I’ll turn him into meat paste!” Zheng Tianyao’s face reddened.

“Haha!” Wan Lingkong and others laughed, patting Zheng Tianyao’s head. “Good kid! We saw you beat that bad guy—well done, hit him!”

“Haha! Uncle Zheng!” Luo Xiting smiled, her eyes like crescent moons as she approached Zheng Xin.

“Damn it!” Zheng Xin felt a shiver, then coughed, his face red with embarrassment.

“Father… your face is red. Is it painful?” Zheng Tianyao was confused, his eyes full of concern.

“Damn it!” Zheng Xin’s anger flared. He grabbed Zheng Tianyao, slapping his butt.

“Damn it, all you think about is fighting! Who do you take after? I was hurt, yet you want to turn him into meat paste! Use your brain!” Zheng Xin scolded while slapping, but held back. His voice was unusually loud.

“Haha! Zheng Xin, what are you doing? Don’t harm the kid! Tianyao is so obedient, it’s for your good. Why are you doing this?” Wan Lingkong and others laughed heartily, secretly pitying Zheng Tianyao for having such a father.

“Uncle, blame me! I’m at fault!” Luo Xiting’s small face was pitiful as she approached Zheng Xin, her eyes flashing threats.

“Ugh…” Zheng Xin stopped his hand. He realized Luo Xiting had seen through him as the “bad guy.” Fearing she’d expose him, he smiled nervously.

“Since Xiting pleaded for you, I’ll let you go. Kid, remember: next time you meet someone stronger, run first. Survival is more important!” Zheng Xin sneered.

Zheng Tianyao looked confused, his face full of委屈 (disappointment). He didn’t know where he’d gone wrong.

Luo Tian chuckled but kept his gaze on the child with a nipple in his mouth, his eyes filled with emotion.

Luo Li stubbornly lifted his face, his eyes red with longing but standing still without approaching.

“Little brother, what are you looking at? This is your father! You’ve always wanted him and idolized him!” Luo Xiting, wise beyond her years, spoke to Luo Li.

“Hmph…” Luo Li lifted his face, giving a soft huff. His nose dripped, and he wiped it.

“Luo Li!” Luo Tian trembled as he approached the child, his hand outstretched with tenderness and regret. He hesitated to embrace him but kept his hands in the air.

Luo Li’s longing intensified, his small hand touching Luo Tian’s palm before darting back.

“Waa…” Luo Li then burst into tears, his eyes and nose streaming.

“Are you my father? Do you want me?” Luo Li cried, his tiny fists pounding Luo Tian’s legs.

Luo Tian’s heart felt as if struck by something heavy, and he couldn’t control himself. He embraced Luo Li, whispering: “It’s your father’s fault. I shouldn’t have been selfish. From now on, I’ll never leave you or your mother again!”

The group watched Luo Tian’s tearful eyes without speaking, their faces smiling as they waited for the father and son to finish.

“Will you teach me martial arts? Will you ride me like a horse? Will you…” Luo Li clung to Luo Tian, his face full of yearning.
