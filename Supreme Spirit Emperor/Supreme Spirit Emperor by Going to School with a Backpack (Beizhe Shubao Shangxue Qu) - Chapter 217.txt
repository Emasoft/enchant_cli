“Hmph! This brat, he hasn’t been forcibly separated?” After Chen Zhanbiao entered, the several individuals monitoring Luo Tian through their spiritual awareness within the Demon Realm displayed bewilderment on their faces. They had clearly felt an overwhelming desire to separate him before.

“Perhaps this brat didn’t rely on his innate power, but rather carried Luo Tian in!” Shi Hongtu smiled slightly as he addressed Feng Jiutian.

Yet, the next moment, people’s expressions turned astonished. They had expected Chen Zhanbiao to last only three breaths, but he moved forward as if unbothered, taking step by step toward a higher elevation.

“Impossible!”

“How can he—just a Nine-source Supreme Being—be able to do this? That’s the purification power I even fear!” Nan Gong Feibai, the Demon Realm’s Holy Son, looked stunned.

“Luo Tian truly has remarkable companions!” Zhou Weilong chuckled, his piercing gaze like that of a sage. He took a step forward, and radiant star patterns enveloped him as he soared toward the Epoch Bell.

“What kind of monster is this brat, that he dares defy purification power?” Sun Feiwen’s face was pale with shock as he watched Chen Zhanbiao, who had surpassed both himself and Sun Mengru in speed.

The Celestial Race often deals with purification power, which is why they maintain such velocity. Yet, Sun Feiwen hadn’t expected Luo Tian’s companion to be so monstrous as to ignore it entirely.

Luo Tian was also taken aback. Chen Zhanbiao’s fearlessness toward the formidable purification power left him stunned. In an instant, Chen Zhanbiao had carried Luo Tian nearly ten zhangs forward, merely leaving a slight sheen of sweat on his forehead.

In contrast, Luo Tian suffered greatly. Though he didn’t need to expend saintly energy to resist it, the purification power tormented him relentlessly, as if every cell in his body were being scorched.

“Zhanbiao, let me go. You should ascend alone!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze gentle. After a brief moment of contemplation, he finally understood why Chen Zhanbiao felt no discomfort.

Purification does not merely affect the body but also the soul. Chen Zhanbiao’s heart was pure, like that of a child—how could it be purified?

“Can’t. I must get you there!” Chen Zhanbiao shook his head, his voice deep and resonant as if echoing from within his body.

“Listen to your elder brother. Let me go, and you ascend alone. Ring the bell as many times as you can!” Luo Tian gently patted Chen Zhanbiao’s back, knowing he had become a burden and was ready to let go.

“Can’t. Though I don’t know what that bell is for, I know it’s important to you. So I must take you there!” Chen Zhanbiao shook his head, taking a determined step forward. His stride was so powerful it equaled two others’ steps, and he was nearly upon Sun Feiwen and Sun Mengru.

“Damn it! What kind of monster is this brat!” Sun Feiwen muttered, feeling Chen Zhanbiao’s proximity—only a few zhangs away.

“Don’t lose focus. Stick to your path!” Sun Mengru scolded softly, but her eyes flickered with surprise.

“Sssss…” Luo Tian’s face was grim. Sweat dripped from his forehead onto Chen Zhanbiao’s back.

“Elder brother, you’re suffering. Should I slow down?” Chen Zhanbiao spoke awkwardly, slightly reducing his pace, his voice laced with concern.

“No. This won’t work. My body state is too weak to reach the Epoch Bell’s vicinity. I’ll only be a burden!” Luo Tian thought urgently, trying to figure out how to deal with the terrifying purification power.

“Pure heart… pure soul…” Luo Tian muttered, his face gradually revealing understanding.

“Unity of Heaven and Humanity!” After a moment’s reflection, Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed. He addressed Chen Zhanbiao: “Zhanbiao, proceed normally. We’ll reach the summit together and make those prodigies envious!”

“Right!” Chen Zhanbiao nodded, gradually slowing his pace before accelerating again. He finally reached Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen.

Luo Tian gazed at Sun Mengru before closing his eyes gently on Chen Zhanbiao’s back, entering the state of Unity of Heaven and Humanity.

Once in this state, Luo Tian’s scorching body—his blood and the saintly energy in his dantian—gradually calmed.

“Exceeded the Celestial Race!” Zhou Weilong wore a bitter smile, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao’s towering form. He hadn’t expected this Nine-source Supreme Being to astonish everyone.

“Exceeded the Celestial Race, so surpassing the Demon Realm is merely a matter of time!” The people on the ground, regaining their senses, stared at Chen Zhanbiao soaring through the sky with awe.

One step per zhang. Chen Zhanbiao’s thick legs were as wide as a person’s waist, his face displaying an unwavering determination.

As Luo Tian entered the Unity of Heaven and Humanity state, his body no longer felt unbearable. The boiling sensation across his body gradually subsided, and his dormant dantian, restored by elixirs, began to emit a soft sound.

Chen Zhanbiao ignored everything, his sole purpose being to carry Luo Tian to the side of that golden bell. This was his only goal.

Chen Zhanbiao’s face turned red, and as the distance closed in, the terrifying purification power made him feel some discomfort. His dark skin began to emit wisps of white vapor, his massive body resembling a boiling pot, emitting bubbling sounds.

Yet, under the stunned gazes of people, Chen Zhanbiao moved swiftly and finally caught up with the ten Demon Realm figures.

“Unexpectedly overtaken!” Feng Jiutian’s face darkened. Though he knew Chen Zhanbiao would eventually overtake them, he hadn’t expected such speed.

“Unexpectedly overtaken!” The Celestial and Demon races’ figures, including Zhou Weilong of the Starfall Domain, displayed shock. They hadn’t expected a mere Nine-source Supreme Being to surpass them all, even carrying another person.

“Haha! See that? That’s my brother. You Celestial Race prodigies and princesses—what are you?” Xu Liyi laughed loudly, his voice filled with pride.

Diao Dezhu and others looked down on Xu Liyi, surrounding him in disdain.

“That man with the person on his back is Luo Tian. He’s a prodigy of the Four Sacred Star Domains. Who would’ve thought that the weakest domain among the Nine Realms, previously isolated, could have such a prodigy? First came Luo Tian, then this black tower-like figure.”

“Haha, you all go ahead. I’ll move first!” Chen Zhanbiao panted heavily, his face showing a foolish grin as he addressed Feng Jiutian. He felt uncomfortable—too hot, as if about to cook—and wanted to quickly get Luo Tian to the bell.

“Damn monster! Stop him!” Feng Jiutian’s face darkened, his gaze turning to Chen Zhanbiao who was about to proceed.

“Right!” Hearing Feng Jiutian’s command, the three men he had pointed out exchanged glances before stepping forward to block Chen Zhanbiao, bearing the terrifying purification power.

“You… want a fight? I don’t want to fight. Move aside!” Chen Zhanbiao furrowed his thick eyebrows, scanning the three men before speaking.

The chapter title: Chapter 962: Chen Zhanbiao Displays His Might

In the second level of the Ancient Heaven Palace, a vast hall housed the golden Epoch Bell suspended high above. The overwhelming pressure made hearts tremble.

A figure resembling a black pagoda stood beneath the blazing Epoch Bell. His dark skin emitted wisps of white vapor, his face showing a foolish expression as he gazed at the three young men from the Demon Realm blocking his path.

These three were dispatched by Feng Jiutian to intercept Chen Zhanbiao. One was a Dragon Race member, while the other two were young men from the Elephant and Crane Races.

“Spit! You really have no shame. I didn’t expect the Eight Great Sacred Clans of the Demon Realm to be so shameless! You’ve disgraced your ancestors!” Xu Liyi shouted, his voice sharp and piercing.

His loud words made many high-level Demon Realm warriors lower their heads, faces flushed with shame. Their gazes turned toward Feng Jiutian, discontented at his actions tarnishing the Demon Realm’s honor.

“Haha! You brat, a Nine-source Supreme Being. I’ll see how you break through three half-Saints!” Feng Jiutian’s voice carried pride, as if ignoring Xu Liyi’s curses and the disdainful glances of the Demon Realm warriors.

“I don’t want to fight you. Move aside!” Chen Zhanbiao furrowed his brows, gazing at the three youths blocking him. Normally, if there was a fight, Chen Zhanbiao would be thrilled. But now he couldn’t—he had to get Luo Tian to the bell.

“Demon Realm people, hah! Truly…” Sun Feiwen’s face bore disdain as he looked at the four men nearby.

“Move aside!” Though Chen Zhanbiao was simple-minded, he wasn’t foolish. His sharp perception detected their hostility.

A deep hum echoed as a thick black staff appeared in Chen Zhanbiao’s hand, resembling charred wood. He gripped the staff with one hand and supported Luo Tian with the other, charging toward the central Dragon Race youth.

“Haha! A joke. A Nine-source Supreme Being wants to break through three of us?” The three Demon Realm youths sneered, watching Chen Zhanbiao approach. Black staffs entwined with nine sources of power hummed, making the three youths scoff even more.

“Sources of power. You don’t even have superhuman strength. How dare you injure us? I’ll crush you here!” The Dragon Race youth laughed, standing still with arms crossed. His gaze held endless contempt for Chen Zhanbiao.

The other two youths showed no intention to fight. To them, a Nine-source Supreme Being was beneath their attention.

“Boom!” But the next moment, Chen Zhanbiao’s black staff struck the Dragon Race youth’s shoulder. This was with only one hand.

Even so, under people’s stunned gazes, the Dragon Race youth emitted a thunderous sound from his body. His form twisted into a meteor and appeared beneath Xu Liyi’s feet in an instant.

Dying, people gasped. They stared at Chen Zhanbiao, who carried Luo Tian and wielded the black staff, their eyes filled with disbelief.

“A single strike nearly killed a Dragon Race prodigy. What kind of strength!” People gasped, watching Chen Zhanbiao’s towering form, as if a mountain that made people feel breathless.

The Elephant Race youth and Crane Race youth on either side of the Dragon Race youth showed fear, their gazes trembling as they looked at Chen Zhanbiao.

The Dragon Race youth was Long Yuhuan, a prodigy of the Dragon Race. His status ranked only below Long Yongfu. As a Dragon, he was immensely powerful. In terms of strength, Long Yuhuan was slightly inferior to Feng Jiutian but far superior to them both.

Even Long Yuhuan had been nearly crushed by the opponent. And this was with only one hand holding the staff. Now, both youths looked at Chen Zhanbiao with fear. However, although the Elephant and Crane Races were among the Eight Great Sacred Clans, their status was lower. While Long Yuhuan could defy Feng Jiutian’s orders, they couldn’t.

“You two. This brat is just strong in strength. What are you afraid of?” Feng Jiutian’s face changed, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao as he addressed the two youths.

“Strength!” The Elephant Race youth’s face showed a glint of light, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao’s thick arms before gradually drooping.

The Elephant Race was known for its strength, capable of rivaling the Dragon and Phoenix Races. However, despite his confidence in his power, he knew he couldn’t have defeated Long Yuhuan with a single strike.

In fact, Chen Zhanbiao was also astonished. He hadn’t expected his strength to be so formidable—nearly killing a half-Saint with one strike. This was something he had never imagined before.

“Haha, I don’t know why! But it’s good. That way you won’t overtake me!” Chen Zhanbiao chuckled, spinning his black staff before soaring into the sky.

But the other two youths weren’t pleased. Their mouths twitched as they blocked Chen Zhanbiao’s path, causing his face to finally darken. His entire body radiated a fierce aura.

“Do you want to fight?” Chen Zhanbiao spoke loudly, his voice resonant. Combined with his intimidating and massive form, it gave people a sense of pressure.

After being blocked by the Demon Realm for a while, Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen had also passed Chen Zhanbiao’s form. Their gazes were filled with amazement, unable to comprehend how a mere Nine-source Supreme Being could have nearly killed a half-Saint.

“Move on. Don’t interfere!” Sun Mengru spoke softly, interrupting Sun Feiwen before they ignored Chen Zhanbiao and Luo Tian’s fate. They continued moving forward step by step.

“Just hold him back for a while!” The two Demon Realm youths exchanged glances, understanding each other’s intent. They then nodded slightly, resisting the immense pressure and purification power while charging toward Chen Zhanbiao.

But they underestimated Chen Zhanbiao’s combat strength. In the sky, his influence was minimal. His already formidable body wasn’t much inferior to a Saint’s. He resembled a human beast, more ferocious than any beast.

The black staff transformed into two afterimages, instantly striking the two youths. Like two dark lightning bolts, they struck their bodies, and the sound of broken bones echoed in the sky. People who were walking gasped.

“You dare to block me? I’ll tear you apart!” Chen Zhanbiao roared, instantly appearing before the Crane Race youth. He withdrew his staff and grabbed the slender young man with one hand.

“Ah…” The Crane Race youth was terrified, seeing Chen Zhanbiao’s fierce aura. He screamed loudly.

“Transform!” The terrified youth roared, and white light gradually rose from his body. It transformed into a massive white crane, but its feathers were stained with blood.

Chen Zhanbiao moved his hands slightly and tightly gripped the crane’s legs. He roared, exerting force with his arms—clearly intending to tear the Crane Race youth apart.

“Zhanbiao, stop! Leave him alive and bring him to me!” Xu Liyi deeply understood Chen Zhanbiao’s character. He knew Chen Zhanbiao would do as he said; no one else could stop him except himself and Luo Tian.

Xu Liyi remembered the old man’s words clearly: anyone who killed would be exterminated. He dared not use the Crane Race youth’s name to exchange for Chen Zhanbiao’s life—it would be too costly.

Hearing Xu Liyi’s words, the furious Chen Zhanbiao gradually calmed. His thick arms threw the crane toward Xu Liyi’s group.

“Boom!” The massive crane crashed onto the ground, and the thunderous sound echoed throughout the space. It was like a heavy hammer striking people’s minds.

“Zhanbiao, throw that elephant down too. When we reach the next level, I’ll treat you to a feast!” Xu Liyi looked at the unconscious crane and gestured with his hands, sealing it before storing it.

“Feast!” People heard Xu Liyi’s words and exchanged strange glances. They looked at Xu Liyi, their hearts pounding. They hadn’t expected these people to be so bold as to dare eat the Crane Race’s prodigy. If this spread outside, it would surely drive the Demon Realm into a frenzy.

Even within the hall, many fierce beasts glared at Xu Liyi’s group. But then Diao Dezhu stepped forward, and the aura of the Saint Beast Yumou Gui Diaos spread, silencing everyone.

Long Jie wore an indifferent expression among the crowd. He had never liked the Eight Great Sacred Clans of the Demon Realm, and whether they ate or not was irrelevant. Plus, Long Jie himself was a food lover.

“It’s your turn!” Chen Zhanbiao took out his black staff again. Carrying Luo Tian had no effect on his actions. His body moved, appearing before the Elephant Race youth again and striking with a single staff.

“Boom!” The sound of broken bones echoed in the sky again. However, the Elephant Race youth’s body was stronger than the Crane Race youth. Chen Zhanbiao struck four times before knocking him into a bloody mess, causing him to fall from the sky onto Xu Liyi’s front.

After this, Chen Zhanbiao felt tired. He tightened his grip on Luo Tian, who had his eyes closed, and looked toward the figures ahead. He roared and rushed forward past Nan Gong Feibai.

Chapter 963: Hungry

As Chen Zhanbiao chased, the higher he climbed, the more difficult each step became. The immense purification power was even too much for Chen Zhanbiao’s formidable body to bear. Yet, he quickly overtook Nan Gong Feibai.

Nan Gong Feibai’s face was grim. The purification power had a strong suppressing effect on him due to his Demon Race cultivation. At this point, he was only fifty zhang away from the Epoch Bell but felt despair. Each step was arduous, and his black-cloaked body began to crack.

Feeling a fierce aura behind him, Nan Gong Feibai turned abruptly. He saw Chen Zhanbiao, who looked like a fierce beast, roaring toward him.

Chen Zhanbiao exhaled white vapor. He felt as if his entire body was boiling, but seeing Luo Tian’s closed eyes and the rhythmic sounds from his body, Chen Zhanbiao’s gaze became resolute.

“Do you want to block me too?” Chen Zhanbiao spoke, his voice echoing through the heavens. He gazed at Nan Gong Feibai and took up his black staff.

“I… I don’t want to fight you!” Nan Gong Feibai’s face was grim. His gaze held resentment. Normally, even if Chen Zhanbiao had a strong body, he wouldn’t be Nan Gong Feibai’s match. But now, Chen Zhanbiao had forced him to retreat. This made Nan Gong Feibai feel extremely frustrated.

“Don’t want to fight me? Then move aside!” Chen Zhanbiao didn’t want to waste time. He passed Nan Gong Feibai, radiating a wave of heat.

“There are still two more groups!” Chen Zhanbiao chuckled foolishly. The Celestial Race’s Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen were also moving slowly.

Although the Celestial Race excelled in using purification power, they struggled under this ultimate purification.

Chen Zhanbiao roared again, scaring Nan Gong Feibai into trembling. He thought Chen Zhanbiao would attack him, recalling the fates of those two Demon Race beasts.

Trembling, Nan Gong Feibai almost fell from the sky. He was drenched in cold sweat.

Chen Zhanbiao howled, feeling intense pain. His powerful body constantly formed water blisters that burst and churned.

“Pain…” As if stimulated by pain, Chen Zhanbiao’s speed didn’t slow but increased.

Soon, he reached Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen. Water blisters burst constantly, blood dripping from Chen Zhanbiao’s body.

“What is this brat’s reason for persisting so? Is it because of the one on his back, Luo Tian?” People below trembled, watching Chen Zhanbiao acting like a madman.

Xu Liyi’s eyes gleamed. He knew Chen Zhanbiao was simple-minded; if someone treated him kindly, he would be loyal in return. Luo Tian had always treated Chen Zhanbiao like a brother, as he did himself. Chen Zhanbiao could sense this clearly. Xu Liyi knew that if he and Luo Tian were in trouble, Chen Zhanbiao would be the first to fight.

“Do you want to fight me?” Chen Zhanbiao’s eyes were bloodshot, terrifying. Each word he spoke sent a wave of blood energy from his mouth. Clearly, the powerful blood energy within him had started to burn.

“You brat! Fight…!” Sun Feiwen saw Chen Zhanbiao’s appearance and showed a hint of battle spirit. He summoned a golden staff in his hand.

But before Sun Feiwen could finish speaking, Sun Mengru coldly snorted and stood in front of Sun Feiwen: “A Nine-source Supreme Being. Are you ashamed to fight? Don’t disgrace the Celestial Race!”

“Right!” Sun Feiwen nodded, his face showing respect. He sighed inwardly that Sun Mengru was right and sheathed his staff.

“Don’t fight… I’m leaving…” Chen Zhanbiao spoke, blood spattering from his body.

Everyone looked at Chen Zhanbiao with admiration. The entire hall was silent, and Chen Zhanbiao’s persistence earned their respect.

“Who is this person? Who would fight so hard for him?” Sun Mengru watched Chen Zhanbiao moving toward the Demon Race people. She glanced at Luo Tian, whose eyes were still closed, and murmured inwardly.

Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen were only several zhangs away from the Demon Race people. At this point, the Demon Race’s faces were grim.

“Roar…” Hu Xiangyang could no longer endure and transformed into his true form. His massive body stood in the sky, his face showing human-like fear.

After Hu Xiangyang, the other three also transformed into their true forms. Golden waves rose, and a golden great phoenix spread its wings, appearing like a shattered sun in people’s sight.

Then, the Lion Race’s Shi Hongtu also transformed into a lion. His roar echoed through the hall.

“Everyone has transformed into their true forms! It seems the Demon Race people are also exhausted!” People’s faces showed awe, watching the fierce beasts in the sky.

The lions, tigers, and golden great phoenixes’ massive bodies blocked Chen Zhanbiao.

Meanwhile, Feng Jiutian wore a faint smile. His gaze turned to the Epoch Bell in the sky. Fifteen zhangs away, Feng Jiutian could even see the complex patterns and flowing runes on the Epoch Bell.

“Ultimately, I arrived first!” Feng Jiutian’s face showed excitement. Fifteen zhangs was difficult, but he was confident he could reach the Epoch Bell’s side. He had no choice but to push himself; it was a pseudo-Epoch Treasure. Now, the Demon Race only had two: one left by Long Zhan Tian and another found by Diao Yuan Shan. The latter had become Diao Yuan Shan’s life treasure.

“I will be the third in the entire Demon Race to possess an Epoch Treasure!” Feng Jiutian took a step forward, his body trembling uncontrollably. His skin also formed many blisters like Chen Zhanbiao’s.

“Do you want to fight me too?” Chen Zhanbiao, now nearly mindless, had only one thought: to get Luo Tian to the Epoch Bell’s side first. Anyone blocking him was an enemy.

“Yes!” Hu Xiangyang spoke loudly, his sharp fangs emitting a cold light that terrified people.

The three fierce beasts’ intimidating presence was overwhelming, but their royal aura made people wary. However, this aura didn’t last more than a few breaths. Even as Hu Xiangyang’s words were still echoing, the three beasts’ fur began to burn instantly, causing them pain.

A scent of roasted meat appeared in the sky. Chen Zhanbiao’s lifeless eyes slightly regained some vitality.

“Food! I smelled roasted meat. My favorite roast! I’m hungry!” Chen Zhanbiao muttered, drool slowly flowing from his mouth.

“Damn it!” Hu Xiangyang and the others cursed, watching Chen Zhanbiao’s drool. They couldn’t bear it anymore and charged toward him with their massive bodies.

Chen Zhanbiao’s eyes showed endless greed. He even forgot to take out his staff, grabbing Luo Tian and rushing toward the golden great phoenix youth.

However, at this moment, the golden great phoenix was no longer a golden great phoenix. Its gilded feathers were constantly melting, appearing to him as a roasted bird.

“Kill him!” The three beasts roared in anger and charged toward Chen Zhanbiao with their massive bodies.

“Crack!” But Chen Zhanbiao didn’t care. He seemed to have targeted the golden great phoenix, ignoring its sharp claws. He grabbed the phoenix’s leg and bit down.

“Sss…” The golden great phoenix cried out in pain. Its other claw fiercely scratched Chen Zhanbiao’s chest, blood splattering and revealing his ribs.

On the other side, Hu Xiangyang transformed into a tiger and took a step forward, slamming his foot onto Chen Zhanbiao’s back. This sent him flying.

Chen Zhanbiao was fierce, but now he was within the last fifteen zhangs of the Epoch Bell. His body had weakened significantly, and his cultivation was out of the question.

After two hits, Chen Zhanbiao was severely wounded. However, he had also torn off a piece of the golden great phoenix’s leg and was chewing it.

After swallowing it, Chen Zhanbiao coughed heavily. His body state was at its worst. Although the phoenix’s meat had replenished him, it wasn’t enough.

In pain, Chen Zhanbiao briefly regained clarity. He looked at the three beasts blocking his path with deep eyes.

“Roar…” The three beasts didn’t give Chen Zhanbiao a chance. Their bodies moved, and their bald forms, though imposing, looked comically ridiculous to the crowd. They charged toward Chen Zhanbiao from three directions.

“Must block!” Chen Zhanbiao roared, extending one hand to block the golden great phoenix’s claws. But Hu Xiangyang slammed his foot onto Chen Zhanbiao’s chest, causing it to cave in.

“Roar…” The lion’s roar echoed through the sky. A bald lion appeared behind Chen Zhanbiao, aiming directly at Luo Tian. They knew Luo Tian was the biggest variable and wanted to knock him down to the ground, preventing him from participating in the Epoch Bell’s contest.

“No!” Chen Zhanbiao roared, turning his body and using his caved-in chest to meet the lion’s thick leg.

Chapter 964: Falling

In the hall, fifteen zhangs away from the Epoch Bell—only fifteen zhangs—but it left Chen Zhanbiao desperate.

Three massive bodies, like a chasm, blocked his path. After previous battles and his own weak strength, he had relied solely on his body and willpower to reach nine hundred and eighty-five zhangs. If no one had blocked him, he might have carried Luo Tian to the Epoch Bell’s side.

But now Chen Zhanbiao felt extremely weak. The massive bodies constantly attacked him, and to protect Luo Tian’s safety, he had only one hand. Soon, this hand was broken by Hu Xiangyang and the others’ force. He had no strength left, his massive body like a big ball being kicked and thrown by the three beasts. The thunderous sound echoed in the sky.

Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen finally reached fifteen zhangs away. They watched Chen Zhanbiao, who was in a pitiful state but still desperately supporting Luo Tian. Their faces showed awe and deep admiration, even Sun Feiwen nodded slightly without challenging Chen Zhanbiao. He spoke coldly: “The Eight Great Sacred Clans of the Demon Race are no better than this. To bully a Nine-source Supreme Being, hah! How impressive!”

After Sun Feiwen spoke, he followed behind Sun Mengru and chased after Feng Jiutian.

“Can’t. I must get Luo Tian’s elder brother to the side of that bell first!” Chen Zhanbiao’s heart cried out, holding Luo Tian in his hand. His eyes showed infinite determination.

At this moment, Chen Zhanbiao’s entire body trembled. He held Luo Tian with one hand and constantly met the three attacks with his back.

Soon, Chen Zhanbiao’s back was completely destroyed. He stood in the sky, swaying unsteadily.

“Brat, you just fought my Demon Race people so well. How does this feel?” Hu Xiangyang’s face showed satisfaction as he addressed Chen Zhanbiao.

“Ah…” But Chen Zhanbiao seemed to ignore him, roaring constantly. His remaining thick arm slowly lifted, pulling Luo Tian’s foot and forcefully pushing toward the Epoch Bell.

This throw used all his strength. He even expended almost all of his blood and energy, leaving himself as hollow as a withered leaf. With Chen Zhanbiao’s every thought, Luo Tian flew like the wind toward the Epoch Bell.

Chen Zhanbiao’s sudden burst of power caught Hu Xiangyang and the others off guard. By the time they reacted, Luo Tian had already vanished before them.

They wanted to block him but were powerless. Luo Tian’s speed was too fast for them to catch up.

“You dare to defy me!” Hu Xiangyang and the others’ eyes filled with killing intent. They wanted to kick Chen Zhanbiao down, moving swiftly toward him.

But Chen Zhanbiao was faster. His eyes closed, and his massive body fell toward the ground.

“Zhanbiao!” Xu Liyi’s eyes turned red, watching Chen Zhanbiao falling from the sky.

“Eight Great Sacred Clans! I Xu Liyi swear, if my brother loses his life, I will exterminate you all within my lifetime!” Xu Liyi spoke hoarsely, spitting out a blood droplet that turned into a red seal and merged into his body.

“Blood Oath!” People heard Xu Liyi’s vow. They saw the red seal merge into his body and showed shock.

“I swear here… I swear here… I swear here…” A series of voices echoed in people’s ears. The Four Sacred Star Domain people all spoke, their voices filled with endless coldness. Blood energy rose in their perception—undoubtedly blood oaths.

“Who are these people!” People saw the fierce glares of the few and instinctively trembled. A deep fear arose in their hearts.

“These are wolves! Anyone who harms one will face the attack of all!” Someone spoke, and as his words fell, the entire hall fell into silence.

Chen Zhanbiao was still somewhat conscious. He gazed at Luo Tian flying toward the Epoch Bell and smiled bitterly: “Elder brother Luo, they all say I’m foolish. I know that’s true. But if you treated me kindly, I would protect you with my life!”

As Chen Zhanbiao’s words ended, he slowly closed his eyes. Like a red meteor, he fell toward Xu Liyi’s group.

Xu Liyi’s eyes were blood-red. He extended his arms to catch Chen Zhanbiao, but the massive body’s impact was too great.

The massive body crashed onto Xu Liyi, and the sound of bones breaking echoed from his body. His arms were completely broken, and he was crushed under Chen Zhanbiao.

Xu Liyi, however, didn’t notice. He climbed up from the ground, and a series of elixirs floated before him. He mindlessly stuffed them into Chen Zhanbiao’s mouth.

“Hum…” After taking the elixirs, Chen Zhanbiao’s blood and flesh began to grow back. His internal organs also gradually formed, but his eyes remained closed. His breath was weak, and his entire body slowly became a scar from head to toe.

“Xiyi, he should be fine. He can be saved!” People spoke anxiously, urging him. Chen Zhanbiao’s state was too bad. Although his body was recovering, his energy was getting weaker.

“I’m fine! Zhanbiao just likes to sleep!” Xu Liyi stood up slowly, gazing at the three bald beasts descending into the Demon Race’s ranks.

Without a word, Xu Liyi moved swiftly toward the Demon Race group. His face was filled with boundless killing intent.
