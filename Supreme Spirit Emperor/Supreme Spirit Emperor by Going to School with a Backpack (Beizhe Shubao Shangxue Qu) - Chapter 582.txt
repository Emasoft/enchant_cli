The ten evil-repelling pills were casually drawn out by Lei Yong, yet compared to the value of the evil-repelling pills, Lei Yong earned far more.

"Commander Lei Yong, though your strength isn't the strongest, one thing is undeniably true—your talent for making money makes you the most prosperous commander!" The people marveled, watching Lei Yong's face blooming with joy.

"Thanks, Xiaotian!" Lei Yong grinned, pushing Luo Tian toward the inner courtyard.

"Senior Brother, I've been your experimental subject all day and even gifted you ten evil-repelling pills. Don't you feel the least bit guilty?" Luo Tian, seeing Lei Yong's lack of division of spoils, teased him.

"Rubbish! Have you forgotten when I deliberately lost to you in the Ultimate Dao True Soul? I haven't even confronted you yet, and now you're asking for benefits! Ten evil-repelling pills are nothing—do you really find them so hard to part with?" Lei Yong couldn't help but curse.

"I didn't say anything, but Ye Liangchen and the others are also in Bountiful Heaven City, right? Why haven't they come out?" Luo Tian chuckled lightly, his brows furrowing slightly as he spoke softly.

"Ye Liangchen? You mean that aristocratic scoundrel?"

"Oh, you didn't mention it, and I almost forgot. He hasn’t returned for a long time, right? We even went out together to find you before!" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Lei Yong slapped his forehead.

"Hum..." As soon as Lei Yong’s words finished, waves of energy rose from Luo Tian's storage ring, causing his face to slightly change. A black token appeared in Luo Tian’s hand—this was the Prince's Token of the Reincarnation Sect. At this moment, only one person in Bountiful Heaven City could contact himself through this token: Ye Chen.

"Dust Brother, I encountered some trouble on the battlefield at Demon Mountain. Hope you can come and help me!" Ye Chen's voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, making his brows furrow slightly.

Chapter 2211: Energy ()

"Demons Mountain?" Luo Tian's mind stirred, instantly recalling why Ye Chen wasn't in Bountiful Heaven City.

"He must have gone to find Ye Liangchen and ended up trapped. Since he could send a message, it means nothing serious!"

"One day's time—I will arrive. Wait for me!" Luo Tian took out the token and sent a reply to Ye Chen, but Ye Chen didn’t respond.

"Let’s go!" Luo Tian spoke, and the golden small car began to operate. Lei Yong and Ji Chen didn’t ask further questions but followed Luo Tian’s back.

"Where exactly is Demon Mountain?" As they walked, Luo Tian asked Lei Yong and Ji Chen. He hadn’t left Bountiful Heaven City much before, so he didn’t know what Demon Mountain was. Upon hearing Luo Tian’s question, Lei Yong and Ji Chen both furrowed their brows, eyes showing a hint of seriousness.

"Demons Mountain—this is a dangerous place within the battlefield. It's said that there's a faction here uncontrolled by either the Immortal Realm or Hell. Whoever enters will find it extremely difficult to leave!"

"However, this is because both the Immortal Realm and Hell are too preoccupied to care. It houses a Demon Lord, whose strength is unfathomable!" Lei Yong explained the general situation of Demon Mountain to Luo Tian.

"Xiaotian, you should rest here properly. I and your third senior brother will go for a while. Your legs aren’t convenient!" Lei Yong addressed Luo Tian.

"Let’s go!" Luo Tian didn’t speak, pouring his cultivation into the golden small car. It moved at incredible speed, flying out of the Eighth Army’s gates.

"Such a fast pace! I wish I hadn’t given this kid the vehicle!" Lei Yong stared in disbelief as Luo Tian vanished from sight, his body flickering as he chased after him.

"Brother, wait for me!" Luo Tian felt anxious in his heart; he guessed Ye Chen and Ye Liangchen were together.

"Luotian, I challenge you!" However, as Luo Tian rode the small car toward Bountiful Heaven City’s gates, a voice echoed in his ears.

A domineering voice carried an immense pressure; a powerful aura descended from the sky, blocking Luo Tian’s path.

The golden small car suddenly stopped, leaving a mark on the ground. Luo Tian's gaze met the person blocking his way.

"Hum..." As Luo Tian halted, waves of energy rose around him, encircling ten miles and instantly repelling everyone inside.

"So fast—someone challenged Luotian, the Commander of Ten Thousand!" As the voice faded, the Eighth Army erupted again. Soon people stood outside the barrier, gazing at Luo Tian inside and the middle-aged man in black armor facing him.

"Jiang Baochao!" People recognized the one challenging Luo Tian and exclaimed in surprise.

"But is this really good? Did he truly have Luotian, the Commander of Ten Thousand, crippled?" People immediately questioned.

"Senior Brother be careful; Jiang Baochao's strength is no less than mine and your third senior brother!" Lei Yong shouted at Luo Tian, his voice heavy with concern. Jiang Baochao's eyes gleamed with greed and excitement as he looked at Luo Tian, who hadn’t risen yet. He was gambling—betting that Luo Tian’s legs were crippled.

Even if they weren’t, Luo Tian couldn’t stand now; thus, he would lose. Even if he recovered later and took back the position of Commander of Ten Thousand, Jiang Baochao would accept it. After all, he had been a Commander of Ten Thousand for two days; he was content.

"Hum..." However, Luo Tian had no time to chat with him. His aura of death surged violently, and a cold atmosphere made Jiang Baochao shiver. At the same time, an immense pressure instantly pressed upon Jiang Baochao’s body. A black sword beam slashed through the sky, radiating an unparalleled aura.

"One Sword to Sever Heaven!" Luo Tian immediately unleashed his ultimate technique, unwilling to waste time on such a battle. Longyuan Sword combined with One Sword to Sever Heaven, plus Luo Tian’s True Immortal Late Stage suppressing Jiang Baochao by thirty percent—this was enough to annihilate any True Immortal Late Stage.

The black sword beam slashed through heaven and earth, instantly appearing above Jiang Baochao’s head. Jiang Baochao trembled in his heart, lacking any desire to resist.

"Poof..." The black sword beam instantly struck Jiang Baochao’s body, slicing him in two like cutting tofu. Crimson blood splattered onto the ground. The barrier vanished, disappearing from people’s sight before it had even fully healed. From Luo Tian's attack to Jiang Baochao’s death, it took less than a breath.

The crowd was stunned, gazing at Jiang Baochao’s body split in two and killed brutally. Their eyes showed disbelief, unable to comprehend what had just happened.

"Instant annihilation!"

"What could withstand that strike?" People exclaimed, trying to find Luo Tian’s whereabouts, but he had already vanished.

"Your father is still your father!" Lei Yong laughed heartily, flying up and disappearing with Ji Chen from people’s sight. The three vanished, leaving a chaotic crowd, their eyes filled with awe as they watched the disappearing Luo Tian and his companions.

"Luo Tian, the Commander of Ten Thousand, is so strong! Even with his legs inactive, he still possesses such strength!"

"Luo Tian, the Commander of Ten Thousand, is only in True Immortal Late Stage. If he truly reaches True Immortal Peak, how terrifying would he be!" People were awestruck, their minds still flashing with that world-shattering strike.

"His current display of strength indicates his legs might indeed be problematic!" However, some people questioned but didn’t dare to act immediately. They decided to observe further; Jiang Baochao’s death had a great震慑 on them.

"Soldiers of Bountiful Heaven City, I am Luo Tian, the Commander of Ten Thousand of the Eighth Army!"

"I will head to Demon Mountain. Those willing to follow me will each receive one evil-repelling pill. If a battle ensues and you kill a True Immortal, you will receive two evil-repelling pills. For a True Immortal Early Stage, three; for a True Immortal Middle Stage, four—progressively increasing!" Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed throughout Bountiful Heaven City, causing another uproar.

"Only need to go and you’ll get one evil-repelling pill! If you kill a True Immortal, you'll get two! This is an incredible bargain!" Luo Tian’s words immediately caught people's attention.

"I am at Bountiful Heaven City’s gates; wait for you all. The time is half an hour!" Without waiting for people to react, Luo Tian spoke again.

"Evil-repelling pills—heard that Luo Tian’s evil-repelling pills are astonishing, one worth five! Previously disappeared for eight years; his evil-repelling pills have been sold at sky-high prices!" People immediately erupted in chaos, their figures excitedly flying toward Bountiful Heaven City.

"Demons Mountain—wasn’t that a dangerous place? They offended Luo Tian?"

"A tiny Demon Mountain, how could anyone dare offend it? They must think no one would stop them!" A series of mocking voices echoed through Bountiful Heaven City.

"Ten... a hundred... ten thousand..." Figures gathered at Bountiful Heaven City’s gates. Luo Tian sat on the golden small car, with Lei Yong and Ji Chen standing behind him. His gaze swept over the people gathering below Bountiful Heaven City.

Luo Tian knew that Ye Chen and Ye Liangchen were trapped in Demon Mountain, and with Lei Yong and Ji Chen so wary of it, this Demon Mountain was definitely no ordinary place. If the three went there, they might also be trapped.

But Luo Tian had his own strength—his status as a Pill Master, whose power could never be underestimated.

Half an hour passed silently. A dozen people with True Immortal Late Stage strength stood at Bountiful Heaven City’s gates. Luo Tian muttered under his breath, his eyes showing dissatisfaction. He took out the Commander of Ten Thousand’s ring and transmitted to several other Commanders of Ten Thousand in the Eighth Army.

"Really?" Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the other Commanders of Ten Thousand showed joy on their faces and flew up to appear outside Bountiful Heaven City’s gates.

Eight True Immortal Peak-level figures—nine Commanders of Ten Thousand in the Eighth Army had gathered, leaving people awestruck.

"Is this Luo Tian’s power?" People were terrified, their eyes filled with reverence. Although they knew those who came here were mostly after evil-repelling pills, and the eight Commanders of Ten Thousand had some deals with Luo Tian, these were still parts of his strength.

"Damn it..." Ke Duanshan sat in his room, cursing lowly. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to stir up trouble again, directly taking away his eight Commanders of Ten Thousand. Among the tens of thousands, most were from the Eighth Army. This departure had emptied the Eighth Army entirely.

"Everyone, if this mission is successful, I will definitely fulfill my promise!" Luo Tian spoke loudly, then flew up and exited Bountiful Heaven City.

Tens of thousands of people, with eight True Immortal Peak-level figures following him—his momentum was overwhelming, even surpassing the Sixth Army’s garrison.

"Damn it, more people than us garrison..."

"There's no choice; the rewards are tempting. Just a trip gets you an evil-repelling pill. This is worth it. Although Demon Mountain is strong, it's still insignificant. Both Bountiful Heaven City and Hell could easily destroy Demon Mountain."

"I would have gone if I wasn’t on garrison. Why not take a free evil-repelling pill?" The garrison soldiers discussed, watching the tens of thousands rushing out of the gates, their eyes filled with envy. Those who missed the opportunity were quite regretful, regretting they hadn’t joined the main group.

It wasn't a time for battle, so no ghosts from Hell appeared. The tens of thousands pushed forward effortlessly toward Demon Mountain.

After a day's journey, they finally reached Demon Mountain. Black mountains appeared in Luo Tian’s vision; the atmosphere within was chaotic, with black mist obscuring the mountain ranges. From afar, it seemed endless.

"Such a large place. Everyone, follow me and push forward! I want to see if they’ll come out!" Luo Tian sneered, drawing his black sword and slicing through a mountain with one strike.

Chapter 2212: Ye Chen's Betrayal ()

Demon Mountain, with its perilous terrain and long-standing ghost mist, rarely allowed anyone to escape. The Demon Lord was the ruler of this place; whether he was a human cultivator, a ghost cultivator, or something else remained unknown. Bountiful Heaven City and Hell had never paid much attention to this Demon Mountain, allowing it to grow over time. However, the Demon Lord was shrewd—playing both sides, and thus neither the Immortal Realm nor Hell had intervened.

The Demon Lord knew his current power stemmed from both realms being too preoccupied or indifferent to him. If they ever had time, he would surely be destroyed. The Demon Lord himself would be captured and handed over to one side or the other, depending on which side won the war.

Thus, the Demon Lord knew he needed to elevate his status—by building strength. Although there were some opportunities within Demon Mountain, even he dared not go to certain places, as it might draw the attention of Bountiful Heaven City or Hell’s cultivators and ghosts. Anyone who entered Demon Mountain would be captured by the Demon Lord, becoming his subordinates; otherwise, they faced death.

Over time, the Demon Lord had gathered tens of thousands, becoming the true master of this place.

At the center of Demon Mountain stood a tall mountain peak, where the Demon Lord resided with his tens of thousands. In a black hall, a middle-aged man sat there, his face filled with dark energy, horns on his head, and two wings behind him. The wings looked realistic, like those of a bat; the man’s mouth had two fangs, and his entire appearance was terrifying.

"Lord, we’ve captured over a hundred people. Their bones are hard; only three have submitted so far. The rest, no matter how we torment them, refuse to submit!" A young man, his face showing respect, addressed the middle-aged man.

This was the Demon Lord, the master of all Demon Mountain. His cultivation level was True Immortal Peak, but ordinary True Immortal Peaks couldn’t match him.

"Continue torturing; I don’t believe they won’t submit!" The Demon Lord sneered, his voice cold. Over a hundred people wasn’t a small number, and their strength was decent; he wouldn’t easily kill them.

"Ye Fu, this time you’ve done great work. I didn’t expect that using that kid as a lure would draw so many people!" The Demon Lord spoke, gazing at the young man.

"It’s my duty. If it weren’t for the Lord saving me from countless ghosts, I wouldn’t be alive today!" The young man’s red eyes flashed with light, his face showing respect.

"Lord, that kid's identity isn’t simple. But with so many people searching for him, might it cause trouble?" A middle-aged man by the Demon Lord’s side spoke, his voice filled with concern.

"Second Lord, you’re overthinking. I know the kid’s background—he is the legitimate son of the Three Star Rivers’ Lord Ye Tian. However, he's a wastrel and not worth much. Even if the Star Rivers’ Lord is strong, they won’t come for such a failure."

"Besides, this place is far from the heavens. Even if they are strong, their hands can’t reach here!" Ye Fu chuckled.

"That’s true; this is a battlefield, and I’ve already contacted Hell. The Kanmen has sent envoys to take us in!" The Demon Lord spoke, his voice decisive. He had been here for years and knew which side was stronger—his subordinates included both Immortal Realm cultivators and Hell ghosts, as well as other creatures.

Moreover, the Demon Lord himself didn’t know what he was; he had been born in this Demon Mountain. Though he had human features and ghostly traits, he leaned more toward Hell.

"Big Brother, finally made a decision?" Upon hearing the Demon Lord’s words, the Second Lord and others in the hall were slightly startled.

"Yes, our current strength isn’t small or large—seven thousand people should allow us to do well in Hell."

"If we don’t decide soon, we’ll be destroyed by either the Immortal Realm or Hell! I feel something big is about to happen!" The Demon Lord spoke softly, his voice heavy with concern.

"Completely under your command; this kind of life is indeed over!" The Second Lord’s face showed a sigh, speaking softly.

"For the next two days, prepare for the Kanmen’s envoy; remember not to cause trouble. Whoever disrupts our plan of joining Hell, I won’t forgive them; you know my methods!" The Demon Lord sneered.

"Yes!" Upon hearing the Demon Lord’s words, people in the hall slightly paused before retreating.

As soon as they left the hall, Ye Fu’s face turned serious, his eyes cold as he walked toward the back mountain. A dark cave appeared in Ye Fu’s vision.

"Lord!" Two guards stood at the cave, their faces showing reverence upon seeing Ye Fu; it was because of Ye Fu’s methods in torturing the prisoners that they were terrified.

Ye Fu stepped into the cave, a smile on his face. This was where those who refused to submit to the Demon Lord were kept. Watching the people in each cell, Ye Fu felt a strange sense of pleasure as he walked toward the deepest cell.

"How are you, brother? Isn’t it especially touching to meet again?" Ye Fu arrived at the deepest cell and looked at the two people inside.

"Ye Fu! Do you know what consequences your actions will bring?" Ye Chen, wounded all over, slowly stood up and gazed at Ye Fu. Two days ago, Ye Chen had led Huo Zhen and Zhang Desheng into the battlefield to find Ye Liangchen. However, he hadn’t expected Ye Fu was also in the battlefield and claimed to know where Ye Chen was trapped. Though he was doubtful, it was the only clue about Ye Liangchen, so he fell into Ye Fu’s trap and was captured here.

"What consequences? The only thing is death, right? I’ve already died once and can’t die again. Do you know where we’re going—Hell?"

"If you don’t submit, we’ll hand you over to Hell’s people as achievements. Three True Immortal Late Stages—should get quite a reward!" Ye Fu spoke, opening the cell door and stepping inside.

"Damn you, Ye Fu!" Ye Liangchen shouted, rushing toward Ye Fu but was immediately kicked back.

"One of the Star Rivers’ next Lord and one of its top disciples—today, I’ve stepped on you. What a mockery!"

"If it were before, neither of you would have imagined this outcome!" Ye Fu’s face showed pride as he walked toward Ye Liangchen.

"Ha! Hell? I hope you send us there. Then both you and that Demon Lord will die!" Ye Chen, upon hearing Ye Fu’s words, had a slight glimmer in his eyes. He was from Hell himself; though he didn’t know what was happening there now, he had another identity—assistant to the Reincarnation Sect’s Prince. Just this one identity could crush many people.

Moreover, he had already sent a message to Luo Chen; Luo Chen would definitely receive it and come to rescue them. However, Ye Chen was slightly worried whether Luo Chen could be their opponent.

"Last time I ask—submit or not? If you don’t submit, the punishment from yesterday will be repeated today. And I’ve thought of a new trick!" Ye Fu chuckled.

"Submit? What are you people? You’re not worth it!" Ye Liangchen shouted, his voice filled with curses despite his cultivation being sealed.

"Looks like you still enjoy suffering!" Ye Fu sneered, stepping toward Ye Liangchen. He waved his hand, and a black whip appeared in his grasp, covered with black flames.

"Boom..." As Ye Fu prepared to whip Ye Liangchen and Ye Chen, a loud noise echoed in the cave.

"Demon Lord, come out!" A cold voice swept through the sky, pressing heavily on Ye Fu and the people in the cave.

"Did someone attack Demon Mountain?" The guards watching the cells showed fear, whispering among themselves.

"Ha! Ye Fu, see? Someone came to rescue us!" Ye Liangchen laughed loudly, not knowing what was happening but still being stubborn.

"Smack..." The black whip struck Ye Liangchen’s face, instantly creating a black wound. Black flames burned on the wound, making Ye Liangchen scream in pain.

"Useless! Do you know what? The Hell’s Gate of the Ghosts has sent envoys. We’re about to go to Hell!" Ye Fu sneered, retracting the whip and walking out of the cell. He wanted to make an impression on the Hell envoys.

"If I return to the Immortal Realm, it would be a great achievement; but in Hell, I have to play the subordinate!" Ye Fu muttered, stepping out of the cell. As soon as he left, his face slightly changed; a heavy pressure accompanied by iron blood almost made him kneel.

"Demon Lord, come out!" On the golden small car sat Luo Tian, coldly speaking. Behind him were tens of thousands of Bountiful Heaven City cultivators; standing behind him were eight True Immortal Peak-level Commanders of Ten Thousand, their aura overwhelming like a black cloud standing on the peak of Demon Mountain.

Chapter 2213: Asking for People ()

Tens of thousands of people obscured the sky. Their aura alone was enough to terrify anyone, and their speed was incredible—almost instantly pushing toward the top of Demon Mountain without giving the people there a chance to react. When they realized, an army had already surrounded them.

"Quickly go and welcome the envoy!" In the hall, the Demon Lord’s face slightly changed. He also felt the pressure and thought it was the Hell Ghosts’ envoy, so he quickly stood up and left the hall. But as soon as he exited, his heart turned cold upon seeing tens of thousands of people and Luo Tian with the eight Commanders of Ten Thousand. He immediately recognized they were from Bountiful Heaven City.

However, when the Demon Lord saw that Luo Tian and his group had no Immortal King-level strength, he slightly relaxed. The Demon Lord had stayed here for years and had his own reliance.

"Who are you?" The Demon Lord’s face was dark as he appeared in Luo Tian’s vision.

"Release the people; there might still be a way to resolve this. If you don’t, today I’ll flatten Demon Mountain!" Luo Tian sat on the golden small car, Longyuan Sword placed on his legs. His gaze was cold as he looked at the Demon Lord.

"An injured person, with tens of thousands—daring to flatten my Demon Mountain? What are you?"

"As for the people you mentioned, I have many. Who exactly do you mean?" The Demon Lord’s heart trembled but his words were firm.

"Luo Tian, why talk nonsense? Just kill them!" Tianfu’s face showed battle eagerness, gazing at the Demon Lord.

"Yes! These people aren’t enough for us to push twice!" A big man with a large sword showed impatience.

"Give you one last chance; otherwise, your Demon Mountain will cease to exist today!" Luo Tian sneered. He first needed to ensure Ye Liangchen and others’ safety; otherwise, there would be no such talk.

A vast spiritual sense swept downward but couldn’t penetrate; it could only see the people on the mountain peak.

"This mountain is strange," Luo Tian slightly furrowed his brows but noticed a familiar figure in the crowd.

"Ye Fu!" Luo Tian’s gaze locked onto Ye Fu, making his face pale instantly. He had just learned about Luo Tian’s disappearance and return, as well as his appointment as a Commander of Ten Thousand.

"Unexpectedly, you’re still alive!" Luo Tian spoke softly; he guessed Ye Liangchen and Ye Chen’s disappearance was related to Ye Fu. He extended his hand, a black hand reaching toward Ye Fu.

Ye Fu had made great progress over the years but his strength was only True Immortal Middle Stage. He couldn’t match Luo Tian; in the moment Luo Tian attacked, Ye Fu felt no desire to resist.

The black hand thundered down like a small mountain. However, the Demon Lord wouldn’t let Ye Fu be harmed, so he spat out a black dragon to collide with the black hand.

"Boom..." The collision echoed, and waves of energy blew Ye Fu’s body, making him stagger. His eyes showed fear.

"Thank you, Lord!" Ye Fu quickly spoke; the Demon Lord was his lifeline now.

"You are my people, I will protect you!" The Demon Lord’s face showed seriousness as he gazed at Luo Tian and his group.

In fact, the Demon Lord was also calculating the pros and cons; in a flash of thought, he had already made his plan.

"You want people? I can give them to you!" The Demon Lord spoke, voice cold.

"That’s easier now!" Luo Tian smiled internally, gazing at the Demon Lord before speaking: "Recently, someone was captured by you. I’m here to retrieve them—Star Rivers’ Ye Chen and Ye Liangchen, as well as those Bountiful Heaven City soldiers!"

"Fine, I’ll give them to you!" The Demon Lord directly replied. These people were decent but had strong bones; if they could survive this, it was worth it.

"Second Lord, go and release them!" The Demon Lord ordered the Second Lord, his gaze still fixed on Luo Tian’s group without relaxing.

"Damn it!" Ye Fu's face was grim, gazing at Luo Tian; his life had been saved by the Demon Lord, but Ye Liangchen and Ye Chen hadn’t suffered much. This made him feel some resentment.

After a while, the Second Lord brought Ye Chen and Ye Liangchen, along with Huo Zhen, out. Seeing Luo Tian in the sky, their eyes showed excitement.

"Big Brother!" Ye Liangchen shouted, unable to believe and rubbing his eyes.

"Master!" Huo Zhen and Zhang Desheng’s eyes also showed disbelief, shouting loudly as if in a dream. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to truly come and rescue them with such a grand display.

"Nothing serious!" Luo Tian’s eyes showed a slight smile, gazing at Ye Liangchen and Ye Chen's pitiful state. However, his killing intent kept growing.

Soon, Bountiful Heaven City’s cultivators brought Ye Liangchen and others to Luo Tian's group.

At this moment, these over a hundred people were extremely pitiful; each had dried blood on their bodies. Their energy was weak, especially Ye Liangchen and Ye Chen, whose wounds continuously bled with black flames burning.

"Extinct..." Luo Tian spoke coldly, and the black flames on their bodies vanished instantly.

"Release their restrictions!" Luo Tian gazed at the Demon Lord, his eyes flashing with killing intent without hiding it.

"Fine!" The Demon Lord knew Luo Tian was still angry; seeing his people injured like this would also make him furious, and this anger needed to be calmed.

The Demon Lord’s hands moved swiftly, strange hand signs flying from his hands and imprinting into Ye Chen's bodies. Their cultivation levels recovered instantly.

Though they were still very weak, the speed of their injuries’ recovery was fast.

"Damn it! Do you know who I am? Daring to capture me, when I return to Bountiful Heaven City, I’ll bring people to annihilate you!" Ye Liangchen, upon regaining his strength, immediately cursed, his voice filled with anger. He had been imprisoned for a month and suffered torment.

"Also you, Ye Fu! I won’t pull your skin or strip your tendons; from now on, I’ll take your surname!" Ye Liangchen gazed at Ye Fu. He feared death most, and this month had made him fear for his life every day—this was all due to Ye Fu.

"By the way, I almost forgot—I also need one person: him!" Luo Tian heard Ye Liangchen’s words and showed a slight smile, pointing his finger at Ye Fu.

If Ye Liangchen had still been under the Demon Lord’s control, he would have considered it. But now, he had the upper hand.

"What?" Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Ye Fu's heart trembled and his face turned pale. He gazed at the Demon Lord.

"Lord, I..."

"I have my own judgment!" The Demon Lord cut off Ye Fu’s words, gazing at Luo Tian. Their eyes met.

"If I don’t?" The Demon Lord spoke word by word, his voice cold. He had already released the people; he hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so demanding.

"Then I’ll flatten Demon Mountain!" Luo Tian sneered, ignoring the Demon Lord’s words. This psychological game had never seen Luo Tian lose.

"Kid, you’re an injured person. We’ve given you a great favor by releasing the people. If it weren’t for your backing from Bountiful Heaven City, do you think you could still stand here now?" The people of Demon Mountain finally couldn’t bear it, their eyes showing anger as they shouted.

"I also need him!" Luo Tian pointed again at the young man who had just spoken out.

"Good! I’ll give it to you!" The Demon Lord sneered, extending his hand. A black hand grabbed Ye Fu and the young man, sending them to Luo Tian’s side.

"Lord, over these years, I’ve done many things for you!" Ye Fu approached Luo Tian’s front, seeing Luo Tian's cold face and Ye Chen’s group. His face turned white, struggling and shouting. That young man was even more desperate, looking at Luo Tian and the tens of thousands behind him, immediately soiling himself with fear. His body was filled with a stench.

"Boom..." Luo Tian struck the young man with one palm, instantly killing him. His hands transmitted divine laws, sealing Ye Fu and sending him to Ye Liangchen’s group.

"Ha! Ye Fu didn’t expect this so fast; our identities have changed. Don’t worry, for the next period of time, your death is a luxury!" Ye Liangchen’s eyes showed mockery. His laughter was filled with satisfaction as he grabbed Ye Fu.

"Is this over?" The Demon Lord looked at Ye Fu being taken away and the young man turning into mist, speaking softly. If Luo Tian pushed further, he would choose to fight to the death.

Luo Tian’s face showed satisfaction; although he also wanted to flatten Demon Mountain, it was the Demon Lord's home ground. Though the Demon Lord showed True Immortal Peak strength, Luo Tian didn’t believe one True Immortal Peak could dominate here. If they truly fought, they would suffer heavy losses; returning to Bountiful Heaven City, Ke Duanshan would definitely have a grudge with him. Jiang Chen had never liked him; if so many people died, he would definitely find his trouble.

"We..." Luo Tian spoke softly but hadn’t finished the word "leave" when an invisible pressure descended.

"Such a coincidence—seeing Bountiful Heaven City’s cultivators!" A cold voice echoed in their ears, making Luo Tian and his group show seriousness.

Chapter 2214: Yechas ()

A cold pressure swept through the sky and earth, making Luo Tian’s group show seriousness. Luo Tian instantly sheathed Longyuan Sword.

Ten figures flew from the distance, their bodies radiating intense ghost energy. They wore black robes; the leader had a half-step Immortal King’s cultivation level.

Most notable was four strong arms, green faces, and four fangs glowing with cold light—more like a dog’s head than a human one.

"Yecha Commander!" Luo Tian instantly recognized the person, his eyes showing seriousness.

Previously, although Luo Tian had only stayed one night in Kanmen, he had been hosted by Wu Mian. He knew the commanders of Kanmen.

"Demons Lord, what do you mean by saying you’re loyal to us but colluding with humans?" The ten figures instantly appeared before Luo Tian’s group, their voices cold and eyes filled with greed as they gazed at Luo Tian.

"Demons Lord has surrendered to Hell!" Upon hearing the Yecha Commander’s words, Luo Tian and his group were alert. Today's matters wouldn’t end well.

Tianfu and others put away their disdain, eyes showing seriousness. Though the enemy was few, one Yecha Commander was enough to trouble them.

"Lord, you misunderstood; these people came to my Demon Mountain and oppressed me. I was weak and had no choice but to surrender them!"

"I have no ill intentions toward Hell!" The Demon Lord quickly spoke, not wanting to be caught between two sides. Now that the Yecha Commander had arrived, if combined with his people, the Demon Lord had an 80% chance of keeping Luo Tian and his group.

"Ah, so many people on Hell’s Most Wanted List!" The Yecha Commander smiled upon hearing the Demon Lord's words, his eyes scanning Luo Tian and the eight Commanders of Ten Thousand behind him.
