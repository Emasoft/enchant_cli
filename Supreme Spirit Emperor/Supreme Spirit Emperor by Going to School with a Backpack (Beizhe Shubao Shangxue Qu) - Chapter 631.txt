"Think you're so smart. These eighteen men—my guess is that it's the result of Zhi Hong's Unbreakable Iron Body Technique perfected to its peak. Unless you give me the World Heart to absorb, I can't break them!" The voice of the Supreme Stone echoed in Luo Tian's mind, causing his eyes to flicker slightly.

"I don't believe it!" Hearing the Supreme Stone's words, Luo Tian had some understanding of this stone. This fellow was always lazy and gluttonous.

"Really..." Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, the Supreme Stone felt an ominous premonition. But now, Luo Tian was no longer the same as before—An Immortal King, he grabbed the Supreme Stone and pulled it out directly.

"You're not the first miracle stone of heaven and earth? These scraps of metal can't even break?" Luo Tian ignored the Supreme Stone's loud outburst and with a powerful swing of his right arm, hurled the crimson stone toward the eighteen copper men.

"Lu Tian, you're not human! You're a traitor who abandons his allies after using them!" The Supreme Stone cried out, transforming into a streak of red light and instantly smashing into one of the copper men.

Almost as soon as the Supreme Stone entered the range of the eighteen copper men's attacks, they emitted radiant light and launched another assault, striking toward the Supreme Stone with fists and palms.

"Clang..." A crisp sound echoed. Though the eighteen copper men moved swiftly, Luo Tian's speed of hurling the Supreme Stone was even faster.

"Ahh... I'm dying from the pain..." The Supreme Stone cried out, smashing into the head of one copper man. That copper man's head collapsed inward, and the Supreme Stone fell to the ground with a thud.

Thud... Thud...

Before the Supreme Stone could get up, another seventeen copper men's attacks arrived instantly. A flurry of fists and palms struck the fallen Supreme Stone, thirteen resounding thuds shaking the ninety-ninth level endlessly. Luo Tian's lips twitched as he watched the Supreme Stone buried in the ground, knowing this fellow would be fine.

"Lu Tian, you bastard! You're not human!" The Supreme Stone's curses continued to echo.

The eighteen copper men had beaten for a quarter of an hour, creating a massive pit spanning tens of feet before stopping. They returned to their original state, except for the copper man whose head had been caved in by the Supreme Stone, which remained unchanged.

"Effective!" Seeing that copper man still standing there, Luo Tian's eyes flickered slightly. He sensed the Supreme Stone's position and grabbed it again with a wave of his hand.

"Pain... I can't take it anymore, my master. I really can't do this anymore! I'm dying from the pain!" The Supreme Stone's weak voice echoed.

"Don't play dead!" Luo Tian knew this fellow wouldn't die. He waved his hand again, throwing the Supreme Stone toward the same copper man.

"Clang..." Another thunderous sound echoed. Another round of impact followed. This time, the copper man's head was crushed inward, and its body collapsed to the ground.

"How is this possible!"

"That's a puppet made from the Eighteen Arhats by the master himself!" The spirit of the artifact exclaimed, watching one copper man fall. He hadn't expected anyone could destroy the eighteen copper men.

The spirit of the artifact knew the incredible durability of these eighteen copper men. This trial was originally meant to test reflexes and speed. The spirit had never imagined anyone would try to destroy the copper men to pass.

"Luo Tian... I really can't take it anymore. If I keep going, I'll shatter!" The Supreme Stone still feigned death, speaking weakly.

"Ha ha, this stone is really strong. Finally saw the kid switch tactics!" The Yin Fish spirit of the artifact sighed in his heart, recalling his own tough times.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian ignored the Supreme Stone's words and waved his hand again. This time, it was even smoother, even channeling his cultivation to make the Supreme Stone a streak of light with more terrifying momentum, striking toward one copper man. Thunderous sounds echoed as Luo Tian kept attacking, and the Supreme Stone was thrown repeatedly. Each time, the Supreme Stone looked half-dead with no strength left.

Luo Tian threw it twenty-six times. The eighteen copper men were smashed fourteen, leaving only four standing while the others lay scattered on the ground, their spiritual aura gone.

"Damned kid! You destroyed the eighteen copper men!" The spirit of the artifact raged, eyes filled with pain but could only watch helplessly.

Luo Tian watched the Supreme Stone stop cursing. He looked at the four remaining copper men standing before him, a smile flickering across his eyes.

"Enough. Stop faking death!" Luo Tian chuckled and stepped forward, rushing toward the eighteen copper men.

"I contributed so much to the celestial realm in my past life. Why am I so unlucky this lifetime!"

"My handsome face... Oh, it hurts so much!" The Supreme Stone's crying voice echoed. If the Supreme Stone had a face, it would be bruised and battered.

As the Supreme Stone spoke, Luo Tian had already met the four copper men. The copper men's attacks were cunning, but Luo Tian was no pushover. From the Nine Realms to the Celestial Realm, Luo Tian had fought his way up, possessing rich combat experience.

Previously, with eighteen copper men, he was crushed. Now, however, he moved effortlessly, colliding repeatedly with the four copper men while secretly marveling at their hardness and the Supreme Stone's strength. He thought, if he couldn't beat someone in the future, just throw stones or poison needles at them—enough to make anyone suffer.

After a incense time, Luo Tian broke through the four copper men's attacks and exited the ninety-ninth level into the ninetieth.

"From now on, these eighteen copper men are completely ruined. Even a novice Immortal King can't stop them!" The spirit of the artifact's heart was bleeding. These eighteen copper men, if taken outside, could still counter an Immortal King at the initial stage.

"Want to continue?" Luo Tian's face showed a hint of admiration. He hadn't expected to reach the ninetieth level so quickly after entering the Light-Heaven Pagoda. This trial was truly difficult.

"The cultivator who created the Light-Heaven Pagoda must be comparable to the Black and White Judges. Perhaps even stronger than them!" Luo Tian muttered, guessing that the next ten levels would be even more challenging.

"Go on. Get that relic and let me recover!" The Supreme Stone's weak voice echoed, but Luo Tian heard a hint of eagerness in its words.

"Maybe not. It's quite good here to cultivate. Huo Zhu is still trying the ninety-fifth level, and it's been two years since he passed two levels. The difficulty is truly high!" Luo Tian then gave up, sitting cross-legged on the ninetieth level.

"Kid, how could you do this? You can still continue!" The Supreme Stone was unwilling upon hearing Luo Tian's words.

"Don't. If you want to, go yourself!" Luo Tian frowned, sensing the resentment in the Supreme Stone's words. He felt the Supreme Stone wasn't thinking of anything good.

No matter how much the Supreme Stone persuaded, Luo Tian refused to enter the ninety-first level. He sat cross-legged and continued cultivating.

Time passed slowly. For a year, Luo Tian never left the ninetieth level. Except for several times being struck by lightning, he kept cultivating.

However, there seemed to be some restriction. After a full year, Luo Tian felt the power of displacement spreading through his body, moving him out of the ninetieth level.

"How short this time was!" Luo Tian's eyes showed disbelief. He hadn't expected to be displaced after just a year.

"Haha, the heavens have mercy!" Unlike Luo Tian's bitterness, the Supreme Stone and spirit of the artifact were overjoyed.

Chapter 2377: The Change in the Celestial Realm

The scene shifted. Luo Tian helplessly appeared on the ninety-first level. As soon as he arrived, blinding golden light instantly pierced his eyes, causing him to squint. His demonic energy also felt uncomfortable.

Buddhist chants echoed, and Luo Tian immediately felt a headache. His mind seemed to hear the voice of the Dao, colliding with his demonic energy.

"The Dharma-Subduing Sutra, and it's the one my master once recited. This kid is in for a tough time!" The spirit of the artifact's eyes gleamed with satisfaction, feeling it had finally gotten even.

The sound of a wooden fish continued. Luo Tian had heard Buddhist scriptures before, and the monk Jie Du often recited them near him. At that time, Luo Tian had only felt uncomfortable, but this Buddhist chant was more than several times stronger.

"Damned..." Luo Tian could feel his demonic energy roaring and fighting against the Buddhist chant.

"Domain!" Luo Tian roared, opening a domain to shield himself. However, it was useless; the Buddhist chant penetrated his domain without hindrance, echoing in his mind.

Luo Tian kept roaring to ease his pain. His willpower even began to blur gradually. Luo Tian knew that if he lost consciousness, his cultivation might be purified by the powerful Buddhist chant and end up like Yao Chen before.

"Stay strong!" Luo Tian kept biting his tongue, which he had torn apart. Blood flowed down his lips continuously.

"Last an hour. But looking at this kid's condition, it might be hard!" The spirit of the artifact muttered, watching Luo Tian's head in pain. This was just beginning, and Luo Tian already seemed to be struggling.

"Mind-Destroying Scripture!" Luo Tian kept circulating his cultivation, driving his demonic energy to fight against the Buddhist chant. The Mind-Destroying Scripture was indeed a world-shaking technique, and after circulating it, Luo Tian felt somewhat better. However, it was still relatively worse than before.

As time passed, the Buddhist chant became even louder. Even with the Mind-Destroying Scripture circulating, Luo Tian felt pain again.

"What is this thing!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly, fighting against the powerful Buddhist chant. But it was no use.

"What to do!" Luo Tian spat blood again, as the Buddhist chant was too strong. It gave a feeling of wanting to worship and submit.

Luo Tian kept roaring, and the entire ninety-first level echoed with his roars and the Buddhist chant.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian endured for half an hour, even with his willpower it was difficult. His eyes became blurry, and golden runes flickered in them. His demonic energy gradually calmed.

Faintly, Luo Tian felt his eyelids heavy, as if they had a thousand jin of weight. He looked at himself with a bitter smile.

"Boom..." Just as Luo Tian was about to give up, a loud explosion echoed in his ears, startling him.

Not only did Luo Tian hear the sound, but all living beings across the celestial realm also heard this powerful explosion.

The entire celestial realm trembled violently, as if struck by something. Heaven and earth roared, and this explosion spread throughout the nine heavens of the celestial realm.

The nine heavens' sky cracked open, and the entire celestial realm was affected. The great immortal kings of the nine major mountains opened their eyes simultaneously.

The world trembled, and all celestial realm immortal kings spat blood, their eyes filled with fear.

On Mount Bountiful Heaven, an old man instantly opened his eyes. His gaze was profound, looking at the cracked sky.

On Mount Bountiful Stone, the Bountiful Stone Immortal King's massive tortoise shell exploded with a crash. The Bountiful Stone Immortal King also spat blood, his eyes filled with disappointment as he muttered, "The immortal path is broken, the fate has ended! Is this beginning?"

In Hell, the heads of the Ten Judges of Hell also stood up. Their eyes carried confusion, but a voice echoed in their ears.

"Three thousand small worlds collided with the celestial realm!" The Black and White Judges exclaimed, their eyes flickering. Their breathing became heavy as they flew up and disappeared from the Wheel Turning Hall.

"We'll combine our strength to enter the celestial realm for three days!" The Ten Judges of Hell quickly gathered, exchanging thoughts. A massive wave of power spread from their hands, tearing through the black sky of Hell and disappearing.

"Middle Three Heavens' rules were attacked. This allows my true self to enter the Middle Three Heavens!" At the same time, Immortal Kings like Bountiful Heaven and Bountiful Stone also stood up, disappearing from the nine major mountains.

The幻天 Sea (Huan Tian Sea) trembled. The vast Huan Tian Sea roared with a massive tsunami. Three streaks of light flew out from the Huan Tian Sea. The three people wore imperial robes, being the three masters of the Huan Hai Tian Gong (Huan Sea Heaven Palace), each a peak immortal king.

"Middle Three Heavens!" The three masters whispered, tearing through space and flying toward the Middle Three Heavens.

"Mo Yun City!" At the same time, sects in the Middle Three Heavens immediately felt the strongest fluctuations. It was located within Star River Prefecture, Mo Yun City.

At this moment, the entire Mo Yun City seemed to fall into apocalyptic chaos. The sky above Mo Yun City vanished, revealing a vast expanse of stars.

Explosions continued. Blocks of debris fell from the domain, as if pulled by something, surrounding Mo Yun City with millions of miles. The area instantly turned into ruins.

Not only did debris fall, but also large amounts of blood and corpses rained down from the breach. Blood poured over the ruins.

Mo Yun City was previously controlled by Nan Gong Yuqing and others. In recent years, its strength had rapidly advanced. Except for no immortal king, the city's strength was already formidable.

But with this apocalypse, the entire Mo Yun City vanished. Not only that, but casualties were also heavy.

"Damned!"

"What's happening!" Nan Gong Yuqing, Diao Dezhu, and Long Jie stood on the ruins, looking at the endless breach with fear. This disaster came too suddenly; they had no preparation. One collision was enough to injure them. The forces of Mo Yun City, except for those below the immortal king stage, were all killed in this collision. Those at the late immortal king and peak immortal king stages were severely injured.

They stared blankly at the ruins around them and the blood rain falling, trembling with sorrow. This was their life's work, carefully cultivated, now destroyed in an instant.

The broken sky did not destroy everything but slowly healed. However, the deathly atmosphere from the stars was even more intense than that of Mo Yun City. Invisible waves flowed down through the broken sky, falling onto Nan Gong Yuqing's body.

"This aura... it's similar to the Nine Realms!" Although Nan Gong Yuqing and others were sad, they had experienced great storms before. They immediately sensed something unusual and took out their identity tokens while contacting Ye Wudao.

No need for Nan Gong Yuqing to contact them. Ye Wudao, Ye Sheng, and Ye Chen who had just ascended to the immortal king stage immediately stood up and flew toward Mo Yun City.

While Nan Gong Yuqing and others were shocked, a figure appeared above their heads. Dressed in gray robes, he stood there with an immortal aura. Although his power was not released outwardly, it gave Nan Gong Yuqing and others a strong pressure.

"Quickly leave!" The old man spoke gently, his voice carrying warmth. Nan Gong Yuqing and others were momentarily stunned.

"Jiang's family, you're fast!" Just as the old man's words had barely finished, several more figures appeared out of nowhere. Each one's aura was no weaker than the old man.

Their clothes were varied, but their strength exceeded what Nan Gong Yuqing and others had expected.

"Is the one in the robe from Mount Xumi?"

"Are these people from the nine major immortal mountains' great immortal kings?" Diao Dezhu whispered, trembling as they could not move.

The three masters of the Huan Tian Sea appeared simultaneously and saw the great immortal kings standing there. Their eyes showed a hint of joy.

"Unexpectedly, even you three old不死 (immortals) have come out!" Upon the appearance of the three, the great immortal kings' auras instantly calmed down.

Light flashed. A group of powerful figures appeared from all directions around Mo Yun City, their bodies radiating strong power.

"Respect the Bountiful Stone..." The respectful voices rose from all directions, including Ye Sheng and Ye Wudao.

"Really the great immortal kings!" Upon hearing Ye Wudao's words, Nan Gong Yuqing and others were shocked. They felt that Mo Yun City might be about to experience great events.

"Roar..." As Diao Dezhu and others were shocked, a roar echoed. A black cloud drifted from the horizon, with ten figures standing on it. Cold energy spread throughout heaven and earth.

"Welcome back to the celestial realm!" A hoarse voice echoed. Ten figures in black robes appeared in the sky, their robes adorned with various ghostly totems. The atmosphere immediately became tense.

"Ten Judges of Hell!" Seeing the ten people on the black cloud, Bountiful Stone Immortal King's eyes narrowed slightly. His expression was serious.

"Ten Judges of Hell, why have you come to my celestial realm? Are you going to break the agreement and start a war with us?" Bountiful Heaven Immortal King's voice was strong, his overwhelming aura pressing toward the Ten Judges of Hell.

"Are you brave enough?" One old man stood on the black cloud, scoffing. His aura surged into the sky, his gaze scanning over the great immortal kings.

"Duanyan Hong, you traitor! Come and face your death!" The old man's gaze fixed on one of the great immortal kings, who also wore ghostly energy. This person was the founder of the Ghost King Sect, a peak immortal king who had come from Hell.

Chapter 2378: The Change in the Light-Heaven Pagoda

A vast expanse of stars appeared out of nowhere, spanning millions of miles. Several figures stood under the broken sky, facing each other with tension spreading throughout heaven and earth.

The people on the ground trembled. Even though these people were all strong in the Middle Three Heavens, those who could shake the heavens with a single step, they dared not say a word in front of these people in the sky.

"Is this where the strongest people from the celestial realm or Hell have gathered?" Diao Dezhu and others dared not breathe, watching the Ten Judges of Hell and Ghost King Sect's peak immortal king Duanyan Hong confronting each other.

"Traitor!" The leader of the Ten Judges of Hell looked at Duanyan Hong with cold eyes.

"If you want to take me, you'll have to see if you have the ability!" Duanyan Hong showed no fear. He spoke coldly. Although there were some conflicts between the nine major immortal mountains, they were very united against Hell.

Duanyan Hong's words had barely finished when the auras of Bountiful Stone Immortal King and Bountiful Heaven Immortal King rose.

"This is the celestial realm. The five of you should return to Hell better!" A old man in imperial robes spoke, being a powerful figure from Mount Donghuang.

"At the moment, it's better to explore this small world that collided with the celestial realm first. If there is a World Heart, we'll take it together and divide it later in Hell!" Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke. Obviously, fighting here was meaningless; even if they fought, there would be no result.

"Good!" The other judges also agreed. They flew up and rushed toward the broken stars.

"This isn't a place for you Hell to monopolize!" The powerful figures from the nine major immortal mountains laughed, also flying up.

"Boom..." Just as everyone had just taken off, a deep sound echoed from outside the stars, pushing forward.

"What is this!" Upon hearing the deep sound, the powerful figures who had taken off changed their expressions slightly and stopped.

Boom... Boom...

The strong immortal kings behind Nan Gong Yuqing were also affected by this wave. One person was instantly turned into blood mist, and Nan Gong Yuqing's face turned pale.

"What is this thing!" Diao Dezhu roared, looking at the endless darkness. Just one wave was enough to kill a late immortal king.

"Quickly leave!" Ye Wudao flew up and appeared beside Nan Gong Yuqing, giving orders.

"Indeed there is a World Heart!" The stopped powerful figures had joy in their eyes and rushed toward the stars again.

"Boom..." However, just as these powerful figures started moving again, a deep heartbeat sound echoed again, causing everyone to stop.

"The peak immortal kings cannot enter!" Bountiful Heaven Immortal King exclaimed, watching the sky slowly healing.

"This is a self-protection measure of the World Heart!"

"We need to wait for the World Heart's world power to weaken before trying to subdue it!" Bountiful Stone Immortal King spoke, obviously experienced. No one dared to argue with Bountiful Stone Immortal King's words. They were great immortal kings of the present age, but the World Heart possessed world power with immense strength. Even they might need to be careful.

"Everyone from Bountiful Heaven's forces below the middle immortal king stage, enter this starfield and find the World Heart. I will reward those who obtain it greatly!" Bountiful Heaven Immortal King shouted, scanning the people on the ground in the Middle Three Heavens.

"Yes!" Immediately, several figures appeared and flew toward the sky. They were all immortal kings, including one at the middle immortal king stage.

Bountiful Stone Immortal King and others also spoke, and many more powerful figures rushed toward the stars. This included Ye Wudao and his two brothers.

Everyone's eyes were filled with excitement. They weren't foolish; they naturally knew that the peak immortal kings couldn't enter, perhaps for some reason. Thus, they could only let them go in. Once they obtained the World Heart, it would be a great achievement. The peak immortal kings wouldn't disappoint them.

Surprisingly, the numerous powerful immortal kings' momentum rushing toward the sky did not stop them. They were allowed to enter.

The Ten Judges of Hell and the three masters of Huan Hai Tian Gong's faces darkened immediately. They hadn't brought subordinates, and even if they had, it would take a long time.

"Ha ha, sorry, you've come for nothing!" The peak immortal kings of the major mountains smiled at the Ten Judges of Hell, not saying anything else. Even if Hell had sent people, they would be too late and might never return to the celestial realm.

"Watch carefully. When those people come out, see who obtained the World Heart and kill them immediately!" Hei Bai Wu Chang and others quickly made up their minds without leaving.

The three masters of Huan Hai Tian Gong also started transmitting thoughts to their subordinates, sending immortal kings from the Huan Hai Tian Gong. Although the sea demon clan's strength was weakened on land, they could still compete. As long as their strength was sufficient, there was still a chance to compete.

Diao Dezhu and others also showed interest. The thing that even peak immortal kings were cautious about must be an unexpected treasure. However, they knew it was beyond their reach. Not only the peak immortal kings, but even two early immortal kings could sweep them aside.

"Watching treasures leave is really painful!"

"If Sun Kedian were here, he would have a plan!" Diao Dezhu's eyes showed a hint of longing, whispering to himself.

In the central southern part of the Middle Three Heavens, in a valley, this was where the second-ranked sect in the Middle Three Heavens, Tian Can Sect (Silkworm Sect), was located. Three stealthy figures stood in the graveyard of Tian Can Sect.

"Ah-choo! Who's talking about me!" A fat man sneezed, shaking the graveyard.

"Shut up! Although that old guy isn't here, it's still bad if we're discovered!" An old man slapped the fat man's head.

"Enter..." The old man looked around stealthily, leading a fat and thin person into the tomb.

The Death Desert also underwent earth-shattering changes. Yellow sand filled the sky, once again causing a terrifying sandstorm that swept across heaven and earth.

Although the sandstorm was terrifying, the Light-Heaven Pagoda in the depths of the Death Desert still stood firm. The Light-Heaven Pagoda had only trembled slightly before and remained unchanged.

In the ninety-first level of the Light-Heaven Pagoda, Luo Tian sat cross-legged. His demonic energy roiled. That explosion had restored a bit of clarity to him, and his mind immediately filled with many images—his life, the people he had met, those he cared about.

"I can't give up like this!" Luo Tian roared. His bloodline began to boil, emitting a series of dragon sounds. This bloodline was from his blood-related Dragon Jie.

"Roar..." Luo Tian roared while emitting a series of dragon auras. The dragon roar contained a special wave, vaguely countering the recited Buddhist chant.

Luo Tian's eyes showed joy. He kept roaring, changing his tone and cultivation flow to enhance the power of his roar.

Time passed slowly. The dragon roar's power grew stronger, and as it fought against the Buddhist chant, Luo Tian's cultivation gradually loosened and accelerated again.

Half an hour... One hour...

An hour passed, and the unbearable Buddhist chant finally stopped. Luo Tian coughed twice, breathing heavily as he slowly stood up from the ground.

"Cough... Cough..." Luo Tian coughed, feeling his throat was torn apart. He wanted to speak but found he couldn't.

"He blocked it!" The spirit of the artifact showed disbelief, watching Luo Tian slowly stand up. This expression had appeared in the spirit's eyes more than once.

"Is it really fate?" The spirit of the artifact muttered. He had never believed Luo Tian would be doomed, but over these years, Luo Tian had reached this level of ninety-one.

"Kid is good. He's even领悟ed a sound-based martial art!" The Supreme Stone's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Means I can't speak, which is quite uncomfortable!" Luo Tian thought to himself, satisfied with the sound-based martial art he had created.

"It can definitely threaten an immortal king. It's also one of my powerful techniques!" Luo Tian thought to himself, imagining roaring at an immortal king to intimidate him. Then a series of subsequent techniques would make even an immortal king in the middle stage unable to withstand.

"But I can't speak. That's really annoying!" Luo Tian then thought about his sore throat, not knowing how long it would take to recover.

"Hope it's not forever!" Luo Tian looked at the flashing scenes around him, thinking idly.

"Where did that explosion come from?" Luo Tian thought to himself. He remembered the震荡 (shock) he had almost lost himself in. If it hadn't been for that shock, he might have already been converted and become a follower of the Light-Heaven Pagoda's master.

"Maybe it's from outside!" He then guessed that something had happened outside the Light-Heaven Pagoda.

"I've been in the Light-Heaven Pagoda for over ten years!" Luo Tian sighed longingly. He hadn't expected to be trapped here for so many years.

The scenes flashed, and Luo Tian's figure disappeared from the ninety-first level. He continued to advance through the trials.

"Rustle..." A massive bone dragon appeared in Luo Tian's view, causing him to frown slightly.

"It doesn't seem very strong. Just an early immortal king?" Luo Tian muttered, looking at the massive bone dragon. Although it was imposing, Luo Tian wasn't afraid.

"According to logic, this place should be able to threaten an immortal king in the middle stage!" Luo Tian muttered, his eyes gleaming with excitement. He guessed that the Light-Heaven Pagoda had undergone some changes.

Chapter 2379: The Demon Body

"Regardless of what changes have occurred, it's temporarily good for me!" Luo Tian muttered and rushed toward the early immortal king bone dragon.

But Luo Tian noticed that Fire Master Meng Wushuang, who was also advancing through the trials, had sensed something. Because his opponent's strength had suddenly dropped significantly.

Others still in the Light-Heaven Pagoda also felt their opponents were weakened slightly. Although it wasn't as obvious as with Fire Master Meng Wushuang and Luo Tian, they could still feel it.

Meng Wushuang's eyes gleamed with excitement. He had already reached the ninety-seventh level, and his opponent was a golden monk holding a staff. Previously, Meng Wushuang couldn't beat this monk, but with the monk's strength reduced, he immediately punched and shattered the monk.

"Spent so many years trapped. It's time to go out!" Meng Wushuang muttered, watching the surrounding scenes twist and appearing in the ninety-eighth level.

"What's going on?" The spirit of the artifact stood there, puzzled by Luo Tian and others' progress. As an artifact spirit, he didn't know what had happened.

"Maybe it's..." The spirit of the artifact suddenly seemed to realize something, his eyes showing a hint of panic. He flew up and disappeared from the spot.

Luo Tian kept fighting against the bone dragon, with large pieces of broken bones falling. The dragon roared continuously, its body unusually tough. Even with Luo Tian's flesh and blood, it was difficult to fight.

Thunderous sounds continued. After a full day, Luo Tian finally shattered the dragon, with bones scattered everywhere.

"Cough... Cough..." Luo Tian coughed blood, his eyes showing admiration. If the dragon's strength hadn't been weakened, it would have killed him.

Luo Tian quickly took out a pill and swallowed it, then continued to advance through the trials.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian began his trial journey again. Although the difficulty of the trials had decreased significantly, he advanced slowly.

Ninety-two... Ninety-three... After a month, Luo Tian finally reached the ninety-ninth level. The last level of the Light-Heaven Pagoda.

However, at this moment, Luo Tian was covered in injuries. His eyes, however, showed joy as he looked at the empty space around the ninety-ninth level.

"Nothing here?" Luo Tian's eyes flickered slightly. He didn't care about anything else and quickly took out a pill to recover.

"Something's wrong. I remember that in the ninety-ninth level, there was an old monk sitting cross-legged. Now it's gone!" The Supreme Stone's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Maybe that's why the previous levels weakened!" Luo Tian's eyes showed concern. He had spent a month to reach this level, and Fire Master Meng Wushuang must have arrived earlier. Yet he hadn't become the master of the Light-Heaven Pagoda.

"First recover!" Luo Tian looked at the empty ninety-ninth level, his brows furrowed. His current state wasn't good. Even if there was danger, he couldn't deal with it with his current strength.

Luo Tian sat cross-legged and started to recover from his injuries. After seven days of recovery, he had recovered eight out of ten.

"Boom..." Just as Luo Tian was about to continue sitting, a thunderous sound echoed above his head. The space of the ninety-ninth level instantly exploded.

This explosion spread throughout the ninety-ninth level, causing Luo Tian to open his eyes. The sky exploded, and a figure fell from the sky, its robes torn and body full of injuries.

"Fire Master!" Luo Tian instantly recognized this person. It was Fire Master Meng Wushuang, but now he had no trace of his former power. His aura was weak.

"Luo Tian!" Fire Master Meng Wushuang also cried out, looking at Luo Tian standing up. His eyes showed a hint of surprise.

When Luo Tian became an immortal king, he had also felt it. And when Luo Tian passed the eightieth level, he knew someone had broken through to the eightieth level. However, he hadn't known that it was Luo Tian.

Luo Tian waved his hand and brought Meng Wushuang to his side. His face was serious.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian's expression was tense. He could feel Meng Wushuang's cultivation had reached the middle immortal king stage, but he was so battered. Something must have happened to him. The crisis that could make a middle immortal king like Meng Wushuang so battered must be beyond what Luo Tian could handle.

"Om!" Just as Luo Tian's words had barely finished, a solemn voice echoed throughout the world. A big-eared monk appeared in the sky, his hands clasped together, eyes smiling as he looked at Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang. His pressure spread, covering the entire space with sunlight. The oppressive atmosphere made it hard to breathe, causing Luo Tian's face to change.

Although the old monk looked righteous with Buddha light surrounding him, Luo Tian felt it was just a surface appearance.

"Kid, this is the demon shell of the Buddha. The Buddha once sought the Dao and severed his body, leaving this demon body. He sealed it within the Light-Heaven Pagoda and made it the guardian of the ninety-ninth level. However, I never expected this demon shell to gain sentience over these years. It has been waiting patiently under the suppression of the Buddha's relic, and it hasn't acted until now. But that tremor shook the Buddha's relic, loosening the seal on this demon shell and allowing it to break free!" The spirit of the artifact's voice echoed, causing Luo Tian's face to darken.

"Peak demon body!" Luo Tian trembled. He understood immediately upon seeing Meng Wushuang's battered state.

"Follow me and become my disciple!" The cold voice echoed. The old monk smiled gently, making people feel as if they were bathed in spring breeze. But to Luo Tian's ears, it made his skin crawl.

"This...," Luo Tian mentally calculated the current situation. Although this opponent was terrifyingly strong in body, he had no cultivation.
