“Puh……” With a single strike, the old man's body instantly shattered. Yet he seemed unaware, transforming into three soul fragments that scattered in different directions.

“Transformed into a soul fragment—this is manageable!” Luo Tian's face broke into a smile. He extended his hand, and another surge of suction pulled the three soul fragments back to him.

Chapter 695: Crisis Springs from All Sides

“Don’t kill me! I’ll surrender to you!” The three soul fragments, their faces etched with terror, cried out to Luo Tian.

“Do you fear death? If you sought to kill others, you should have accepted the possibility of being killed!” Luo Tian's expression remained cold. A verdant-blue flame flickered in the black void, casting a faint green glow. Unrelenting, it consumed the three soul fragments in flames.

After eliminating the old man, Luo Tian retraced his steps to find the rift in space. With a single hand gesture, he tore through the void and reappeared at the site of their battle.

“Still one escaped!” Luo Tian gazed toward the direction the other old man had fled, his face darkening with disappointment.

“If I had reached the peak of Soul Formation, those three wouldn’t have escaped!” Luo Tian’s face hardened as he muttered to himself.

“Roar……” As Luo Tian spoke, a thunderous dragon’s roar echoed through the void, freezing his gaze.

A surge of golden light erupted from the void, turning the sky into a golden hue. The void tore open, revealing a golden dragon’s head in Luo Tian’s vision. He blinked in surprise before a smile tugged at his lips.

“Brother, why did you run so fast? I almost lost you!” A hundred-foot-long golden dragon soared from the void, its massive body and overwhelming aura leaving Luo Tian awestruck.

Hearing Long Jie’s words, Luo Tian’s lips twitched in exasperation. He sighed internally—was it not for avoiding your father?

“Puh……” The massive dragon’s head lifted, unleashing an invisible gust that surged toward Luo Tian. A black figure followed the blast, flying straight at him.

Seeing the shadowy figure, Luo Tian’s eyes lit with joy. He extended his hand and seized the half-dead shadow.

“Well done, Longbao… Jie!” Luo Tian addressed Long Jie as he held the shadow.

The shadow was none other than the old man who had escaped Luo Tian’s grasp earlier. Luo Tian hadn’t expected Long Jie to intercept him.

Luo Tian gazed at Long Jie’s golden dragon body, far larger than his own. He marveled—without even sensing Long Jie’s arrival, he now might not be his match.

“I thought you had fled, but it seems you couldn’t escape after all!” Luo Tian’s expression turned playful as he addressed the weakened old man.

“Don’t kill me—I’m from the Qionghua Sect. Killing me will bring you great trouble!” The old man trembled as he spoke, his threat lacking any real conviction.

“Qionghua Sect? Indeed!” The old man’s words confirmed Luo Tian’s suspicions. He had already considered the three old men’s origins when they appeared.

At present, Luo Tian had no mortal enemies in the East, South, or North regions. Though many hated him, they were all insignificant. The only one was Jiang Rong—Luo Tian knew the Qionghua Sect would trace his killing of her. He hadn’t expected them to act so swiftly.

“Pang!” Luo Tian crushed the old man’s physical form, his emerald-blue flame consuming the soul fragment. His face bore a cold expression.

As the three old men perished, in the Qionghua Sect’s southern domain, an elderly woman watched three soul-lamps shatter one by one. Her face darkened.

“Three Soul Formation late-stage experts—yet you couldn’t kill them?” Her gaze held a chill as she clutched a jade pendant, issuing orders into it.

“Three Soul Formation late-stage experts—this is a massive loss for the Qionghua Sect. First, you killed our sect’s young master; then, our three senior elders. This enmity is irreconcilable. Wuxing Sect! I truly wonder where your confidence comes from!” The woman muttered, then vanished into the hall.

As her orders spread, the Qionghua Sect’s elders stirred. Soul Formation early-stage to peak-stage elders ascended into the sky, leaving disciples in awe.

Ten Soul Formation early-stage, ten mid-stage, six late-stage, and six peak-stage elders—each a formidable presence. The disciples gasped in astonishment.

The woman appeared atop the sky, her body slightly hunched but her aura immense, instilling fear.

“The Qionghua Three are dead—killed by the Wuxing Sect. Go, leave half of you behind; the rest will accompany me to the Wuxing Sect!” Her voice rang out, and she vanished from sight.

“Wuxing Sect? How bold—daring to attack our Qionghua Sect!” A woman radiated a powerful aura, her voice laced with endless killing intent. She didn’t even inquire why the three had died.

The other Qionghua Sect disciples bore icy expressions. To them, killing a sect member was a death sentence.

The Qionghua Sect differed from other sects in the southern domain, boasting more female disciples. Due to this, its true strength wasn’t its own power but its terrifying connections.

Immortal cultivators’ lifespans are long, making finding a compatible partner nearly impossible. Thus, the Qionghua Sect became a coveted prize for sects.

Indeed, most of the southern domain had ties to the Qionghua Sect. If someone dared attack it, they’d be akin to poking a wasp nest.

Yet these elders underestimated the Wuxing Sect, dispatching merely a dozen Soul Formation experts to confront them.

The truth was undeniable—against such an overwhelming force, the Wuxing Sect would be crushed. Especially with that terrifying woman.

A group of a dozen people transformed into a meteor, streaking toward Jinyu City’s teleportation array.

Unaware of the impending crisis, Luo Tian and Long Jie returned to the Wuxing Sect discreetly.

Luo Tian had intended to gloat, riding Long Jie’s massive dragon body for a loop around the sect. But he reconsidered—time was too urgent now.

At that moment, Luo Tian held a crystalline elixir outside his courtyard, his face etched with admiration. “Indeed, I can now craft eighth-grade elixirs—though not yet skilled, it’s manageable. The real challenge is ninth-grade elixirs!”

Chapter 696: Ascending to Ninth-Grade Alchemist

Chapter 696: Ascending to Ninth-Grade Alchemist

“Boom… boom…” Thunder rumbled incessantly over the Wuxing Sect, sending disciples into fear.

“How many days has it been?”

“Third day… the thunder hasn’t ceased for three days. What is Luo Tian trying to craft?” Lu Kunpeng stood in his courtyard, a puzzled look on his face as he materialized at Luo Tian’s gate.

“Eighth-grade!” Lu Kunpeng barely stepped into Luo Tian’s courtyard before recognizing the elixir in his hand.

Lu Kunpeng had spent his life mastering alchemy; he instantly identified the elixir. Though prepared, seeing Luo Tian’s eighth-grade elixir still startled him. His face lit up with joy.

Lu Kunpeng had dedicated his life to alchemy, achieving only seventh-grade status. Though nearing eighth-grade, he remained a seventh-grade alchemist. Seeing Luo Tian—so young—reach eighth-grade filled him with pride.

After his initial joy, Lu Kunpeng’s face turned envious. He had devoted his life to alchemy yet lagged behind a young prodigy.

“Senior Grandmaster!” Luo Tian addressed Lu Kunpeng, his face respectful.

“Well done, kid! You’ve surpassed me! The entire alchemy hall has only a few old masters at eighth-grade. You’re truly—” Lu Kunpeng’s voice carried admiration.

“Eighth-grade is simple; just feed it rare herbs!” Luo Tian sighed, recalling the countless herbs wasted.

“Go to hell!” Lu Kunpeng smacked Luo Tian’s head, thinking he was boasting.

“By the way, Senior Grandmaster, I have some herbs. Could you ask someone to sort them for me?” Luo Tian smiled, ignoring Lu Kunpeng’s thoughts.

“Big attitude—asking someone to sort herbs!” Lu Kunpeng scowled, his expression dismissive. Yet his eyes gleamed with calculation, recalling Luo Tian’s endless supply of herbs.

Seeing Lu Kunpeng’s gaze, Luo Tian understood his thoughts but didn’t dwell on it. He was now flush with resources. With a wave, thirty storage bags materialized before Lu Kunpeng.

“Start with these! Once sorted, give me ten; keep another ten for yourself. With this, you’ll surely reach eighth-grade. If not, just ask me!” Luo Tian spoke generously.

At the sight of thirty storage bags, Lu Kunpeng’s eyes locked onto them.

Thirty bags of herbs nearly matched the entire herb hall. This was enough to stir Lu Kunpeng’s greed.

“Good, good, good!” Lu Kunpeng snatched the bags and vanished, rushing to the herb hall to assign disciples for sorting.

Seeing Lu Kunpeng’s eagerness, Luo Tian smiled and ignored it. He retrieved the Zhenhun Cauldron again.

Now, his courtyard was in ruins after three days of thunderstorms. He patted the cauldron, a look of regret crossing his face—thinking of Zhao Fengshan and his wife within.

“Forgive me, Brother Zhao. One day, I’ll free you both!” Luo Tian murmured.

“Woo…” As if sensing his words, the Zhenhun Cauldron trembled.

One could notice that the cauldron’s appearance hadn’t changed, but its aura had vastly improved. Previously, it exuded a heavy presence; now, it felt more agile, as if alive.

Luo Tian had discovered this change only recently while alchemizing. Upon inspection, he was stunned—the cauldron had ascended from a high-grade earth-level artifact to a heavenly-tier one.

Even more astonishing was Zhao Fengshan and his wife’s absence from the cauldron, yet their soul essence remained within.

“Soul Spirit!” Luo Tian finally understood—Zhao Fengshan and his wife had become the cauldron’s soul spirit, enabling its ascension. The reason remained unknown.

This revelation filled Luo Tian with guilt. He had planned to free them after resolving current matters but hadn’t expected this turn of events.

Guilt mingled with relief—thankfully, he hadn’t placed Danyan’s soul in the cauldron. If so, Zheng Xin would surely fight him.

“Ugh… back to work. First, complete all eighth-grade elixirs, then attempt ninth-grade. If successful, the Wuxing Sect’s elite strength will soar. Then I’ll reach Soul Formation peak—chaos power is mine, but my cultivation lags!” Luo Tian’s face lit with anticipation.

“Boom… boom…” After a brief rest, golden lightning struck his courtyard again, sending disciples into alarm.

The following days saw Dong Sansi delivering a storage bag daily to Luo Tian, each filled with sorted herbs by the alchemy hall.

Luo Tian handed these eighth-grade elixirs to Dong Sansi, who distributed them among the sect and delivered them to Wei Mingxuan.

Wei Mingxuan was overjoyed—these eighth-grade elixirs would elevate the Wuxing Sect’s strength.

In the following days, thunderstorms rumbled constantly across the sect. High-level disciples ascended to Soul Formation, and elites like Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei smoothly reached mid-Soul Formation.

This was heartening; the Wuxing Sect now boasted its strongest generation ever, delighting Wei Mingxuan and the five peak elders. Yet one thing was missing: a Soul Formation peak elder who had grasped chaos power.

Chapter 697: Ascending to Ninth-Grade Alchemist

Chapter 697: Ascending to Ninth-Grade Alchemist

In the northern domain, the Wuxing Sect echoed with thunder. Disciples had grown accustomed to it, knowing it was their young master, Luo Tian, alchemizing.

“Ha! I see now!” A long laugh echoed through the alchemy hall, startling disciples. They glanced toward Luo Tian’s ruined courtyard—now no longer a modest one, but a battlefield of thunderstorms.

“Is Luo Tian about to ascend to ninth-grade alchemist?” Disciples marveled, rushing toward his location.

“That kid!” Lu Kunpeng’s face lit with joy as he vanished into the alchemy hall.

People materialized from across the sect, gathering around the Zhenhun Cauldron where Luo Tian stood, his face alight with joy.

“Kid, are you about to become a ninth-grade alchemist?” Lu Kunpeng appeared in the sky, addressing Luo Tian seated on the ground.

Hearing this, Luo Tian’s lips curled into a smile. “Senior Grandmaster, it’s obvious!”

Luo Tian’s words ended as he patted the cauldron. The lid flew off, and countless celestial herbs were tossed into it by his “Falling Petal Elixir” technique. The alchemy hall disciples marveled.

“Such a vast array of herbs—Luo Tian must be crafting a ninth-grade elixir!” They whispered, envy in their voices.

Among the crowd stood Dong Sansi. He mused that if disciples knew this batch of herbs was but a fraction of what Luo Tian had wasted, they’d be speechless.

After speaking, Luo Tian sat cross-legged, adjusting his state—a habit he’d developed over these days. He treated every alchemy session as if it were ninth-grade, striving for his peak condition.

The alchemy hall disciples watched silently as Luo Tian sat on the ground, awaiting his first move. Even Lu Kunpeng was present, and more people gathered.

“One hour… two hours…” Luo Tian sat for half an hour before adjusting his state. He opened his eyes, and all felt he was at peak condition, a serene clarity radiating from him.

Numerous hands appeared like autumn leaves, skillfully refining the elixir into over a hundred portions. A faint fragrance spread.

“Refine the elixir!” Luo Tian roared, gazing at the sky. His spiritual sense controlled the over a hundred portions merging.

A thunderous sound echoed from both the cauldron and the sky, causing Lu Kunpeng and other disciples to tense. They knew this elixir would be a masterpiece, as the lightning bore a faint violet hue—terrible Purple Yuan Demon Lightning.

“Refine! Refine! Refine!” Luo Tian repeated, each word intensifying the thunder in the cauldron and sky.

“One… ten… a hundred…” An hour later, Luo Tian had merged over a hundred elixir portions.

A crystalline elixir spun within the cauldron, absorbing surrounding spiritual energy.

“Enough! Now!” Luo Tian roared, flicking a wisp of gray mist from his finger.

“Chaos power!” Lu Kunpeng’s face finally showed shock, gazing at Luo Tian. He hadn’t expected him to possess chaos power.

The wispy gray mist entered the cauldron, merging with the emerald elixir.

“Boom… boom…” At this fusion, the sky darkened. Purple lightning formed a thick dragon in the black storm clouds.

“Pang!” The cauldron’s lid flew open.

The emerald elixir, fused with chaos power, gradually gained a gray mist. It seemed to awaken its own spirit, exiting the cauldron without Luo Tian’s permission.

“Woo…” Upon exiting, the elixir spun wildly, like a sovereign ruler, appearing before everyone. The spiritual energy of Wuxing Mountain trembled, rushing into the elixir.

“Chaos True Luo Elixir! Success—now see if it survives the thunderstorm!” Luo Tian’s face lit with excitement.

“Crack…” Purple lightning, carrying a thunderous aura, streaked across the sky.

“A roar!” The lightning dragon instantly appeared above the elixir, striking it.

“Failed? It didn’t even withstand Purple Yuan Demon Lightning?” The purple lightning consumed the elixir, obscuring sight. Disciples’ faces fell in disappointment.

“No—failure!” Three old men appeared in the sky, their faces lit with excitement as they gazed at the purple lightning.

“Respect the elders!” Seeing them, Lu Kunpeng’s face showed shock as he bowed.

“Elders! These are the legendary elders of our alchemy hall! We didn’t expect Luo Tian to draw them out!” Disciples murmured, their gazes respectful.

Though the three elders were only mid to late Soul Formation, their alchemy mastery was renowned across Tianyuan Continent.

They now gazed at the elixir, their faces alight with excitement. All three were eighth-grade alchemists who had spent years without reaching ninth-grade. Now, seeing someone craft a ninth-grade elixir, they naturally observed.

“Woo…” As people stared in awe, after dozens of seconds, the purple lightning storm finally dissipated. A resonant hum pierced their ears.

“Success!” Luo Tian roared, his body transforming into a streak of golden light in the sky.

Towering golden light erupted, forcing people to squint their eyes as if facing the sun.

The next moment, the golden light vanished, absorbed by something unseen. When people opened their eyes again, Luo Tian stood there with a smile.

Chapter 698: All Enter Seclusion

Chapter 698: All Enter Seclusion

“Excellent!”

“A ninth-grade elixir—no mistake! Kid, what’s the name of this elixir?” The three elders’ voices trembled with excitement as they addressed Luo Tian.

“Ninth-grade elixir—Chaos True Luo Elixir!” Luo Tian’s face showed satisfaction as he pocketed the elixir.

The Chaos True Luo Elixir was once crafted by Sichuan Chen of the Xian Gu Continent. Luo Tian recognized it, hence his choice to create this elixir.

“Can you tell us how you succeeded?” The three elders trembled, their gazes pleading.

“Chaos power—ninth-grade elixirs must have chaos power!” Luo Tian revealed his thoughts without hesitation.

This Chaos True Luo Elixir succeeded because he added a thread of chaos power at the final stage.

“Chaos power—chaos power! Heh, we three pursued alchemy all our lives, even abandoning cultivation. Yet we failed to become ninth-grade alchemists due to lacking chaos power.”

“Alas… now that you’ve become a ninth-grade alchemist, enhance the Wuxing Sect’s strength. We three old men will also contribute—after all, war is near; better prepare and strengthen ourselves!” The three elders spoke, leading Luo Tian to the alchemy hall’s back mountain.

As they vanished, disciples gazed with admiration, returning to their quarters.

“Alchemy hall disciples! From today on, all will freely craft elixirs for the Wuxing Sect’s peaks to enhance its overall strength!” As disciples returned, Zhang Ziping’s voice echoed.

“What?”

“Free elixirs for the peaks!” Peaks’ disciples looked excitedly toward the alchemy hall.

This decision was made by Luo Tian, Lu Kunpeng, Zhang Ziping, and the elders. The Wuxing Sect’s strength was still too weak.

In the following days, the alchemy hall buzzed with activity. From elders to disciples, all flocked there, offering herbs for elixirs.

Luo Tian hadn’t rested these days. Though he crafted the Chaos True Luo Elixir, other ninth-grade elixirs remained challenging. The three elders’ alchemy mastery greatly aided him; within three days, he fully entered ninth-grade alchemy, becoming a rare ninth-grade alchemist in the northern domain.

After stabilizing at ninth-grade, he and the three elders, along with Lu Kunpeng, began refining elixirs. Countless elixirs poured from the elders’ quarters, passed to peak leaders, masters, and talented disciples.

The Wuxing Sect saw daily elixirs and daily promotions, leaving northern sects envious.

…

That day, early morning, five elders dragged Luo Tian out toward a seemingly unremarkable hill.

Luo Tian smiled—after these days, two of the five peak elders had begun grasping chaos power. Soon, they’d reach Soul Formation peak with a thread of chaos power. At that time, the Wuxing Sect’s strength would leap forward.

With five elders and Luo Tian, six people walked through a dim corridor. Though Luo Tian didn’t know where they were headed, he sensed it was no ordinary place—each elder’s gaze grew more respectful as they ventured deeper.

“Crack…” After about half an hour, they stopped. The five elders skillfully opened a door, revealing a sight that stunned Luo Tian.

His eyes widened as he saw an ancient stone gate covered in runes, radiating immense power. He was certain that if these runes were on him, he’d be sealed into a commoner in moments.

“Luo Tian, your current strength allows you to access the Wuxing Sect’s secrets!” Jinfeng Elder spoke, his gaze tinged with sorrow.

“Our sect has stood on the Tianyuan Continent for years, enduring hardships. You’ve heard of the Tianshi Sect’s strength. Originally, they were called Wangyue Sect in the Xian Gu Continent. After their arrival on Tianyuan, they planned to blood sacrifice it—just like they did with the Xian Yuan Continent!”

“At that time, our Wuxing Sect was truly the top sect on Tianyuan. Both strength and numbers were unmatched!”

“The Tianshi Sect, originally named Wangyue Sect, suffered heavy losses in the Xian Gu Continent. Upon arriving on Tianyuan, they aimed to blood sacrifice it. We Wuxing Sect’s first elder united with other sects to stop them, saving Tianyuan. This was the start of our decline!” The five elders’ faces bore a bitter smile, recalling that fierce battle.

“After that battle, rumors claimed our first elder had died. Only a few knew he hadn’t perished but was severely injured, with evil energy seeping into his body.” They spoke one by one, recounting the past to Luo Tian, who listened with admiration.

“Elders, what can I do?” Luo Tian gazed at the rune-covered gate, asking softly. He didn’t believe the five elders had called him just to tell stories.

“Over these years, we’ve strengthened our first elder’s seal. He alternates between clarity and madness. We dare not release him! After years of research, we’ve finally found a way to restore him and expel the evil energy!” Jinfeng Elder’s face lit with excitement.

“Elder, please speak plainly. If any help is needed, just say so!” Luo Tian knew these elders had called him for a reason.

“Good. No danger—just borrow your emerald-blue flame and strong spiritual sense. If we’re right, your spiritual sense is nearly at the界尊境 (Boundary Lord Realm)!” Mufeng Elder marveled, gazing at Luo Tian with admiration for his youth.

Hearing Mufeng Elder’s words, Luo Tian didn’t object. He felt his spiritual sense was nearing the Boundary Lord Realm.

“Roar…” As they spoke, a thunderous roar interrupted them.

Chapter 699: Healing the First Elder

Chapter 699: Healing the First Elder

“Boom… boom… boom…” The sound of collisions mixed with furious roars echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, causing his gaze to flicker.

“What must I do?” Luo Tian knew if the first elder recovered, the Wuxing Sect would fear no sect. The first elder, who had once been the top sect leader, must have grasped chaos power at Soul Formation peak—or even the Boundary Lord Realm. He believed it.

The five elders moved their hands, and black runes on the gate floated off, dispersing into dark mist.

Time passed; after about a quarter-hour, the black runes vanished entirely. The roaring ceased gradually.

“Go! Follow our instructions!” Jinfeng Elder spoke, stepping into the stone chamber.

Upon entering, the five stood at their positions, gazing respectfully at a frail figure bound in chains.

“Elder, this is our sect’s young prodigy, Luo Tian…” Jinfeng Elder introduced Luo Tian to the first elder.

“This… this is the first elder? A monkey?” Luo Tian gazed at the withered figure, confusion stirring.

“Respect the first elder!” Yet Luo Tian restrained himself, bowing to the elder.

Hearing Luo Tian and the peak elders’ words, the withered monkey slowly opened his eyes. A flash of red light glowed within them before scanning Luo Tian.

“Good! I entrust you!” The first elder smiled, speaking to Luo Tian before falling silent and sitting cross-legged.

Seeing the first elder’s gaze, Luo Tian was stunned—eyes filled with沧桑 (sorrow and experience), as if seeing through everything. His every technique and possession seemed laid bare.

“Boundary Lord! This withered monkey must have once been a Boundary Lord!” Luo Tian’s eyes widened in disbelief, gazing at the frail figure.

“Begin! Delaying further will make the elder’s condition worsen!” The five elders roared, pointing their fingers. Black runes flew from their hands, forming five black dragons circling the first elder.

“Luo Tian, fill the chamber with your emerald-blue flame!” Jinfeng Elder commanded.

“Got it…” Luo Tian smiled, his emerald-blue flame surging from his body, filling the chamber with a blazing inferno. The heat made the peak elders’ gazes narrow slightly.

…

Outside Wuxing Mountain.

“Boom… boom…” Thunder rumbled incessantly over Wuxing Mountain and the surrounding hundred-li area.

The Wuxing Sect had reached its peak, with disciples constantly ascending to Yuanling (Soul Formation) and Jipao (Soul Sealing). The sect’s strength had soared to terrifying levels.

Far away, ten elders bore cold killing intent toward the Wuxing Sect.

“Hmph! So many disciples are undergoing thunderstorms—did the Wuxing Sect obtain some great cultivation?” A woman-like figure sneered, gazing at the thunderclouds covering Wuxing Mountain.

“No use—killing my Qionghua Sect’s people, today the Wuxing Sect will be destroyed!” The leading elder’s face bore cold killing intent. She materialized above the Wuxing Sect.

“Disperse…” The elder waved her hand, her voice like thunder, carrying a mystical power. The dark clouds of thunderstorms gradually dissipated, leaving Wuxing disciples confused.

Golden sunlight, long absent, now shone over the sect, leaving disciples astonished. They didn’t understand why thunderstorms had ceased.

“What’s happening? Why did the thunderclouds vanish?”

“Hey! What’s that figure in the sky?” Disciples murmured, gazing at the thirteen people above. Their faces bore fear.

“Wuxing Sect disciples! The sect leader and elders—come out!” The elder’s voice carried killing intent, scanning the Wuxing Sect with her spiritual sense.

“Pang!” Under this killing intent, some Yuanling disciples broke into cold sweat. Others in the Cultivation and Bone-Transformation stages collapsed to the ground.

This was only one elder—yet she had made millions of Wuxing disciples gasp for breath.

“Respectful elder, I am the Wuxing Sect’s leader, Wei Mingxuan. I don’t know your purpose here!” Wei Mingxuan felt a bad premonition but stepped forward respectfully, flying into the sky.

At the same time, Gu Qianxue, Gu Lei, Xu Liyi, Long Jie, and others ascended into the sky, standing behind Wei Mingxuan.

Seeing these young disciples with such cultivation, the elder’s eyes widened in surprise—unaware that the Wuxing Sect had so many prodigies.

“You Wuxing Sect have a disciple named Luo Tian, who killed the wrong person. I declare—Wuxing Sect! Today! It will be destroyed!” The elder coldly spoke, her voice like a frigid wind in their ears.

“Sigh…” Hearing this, Tian Luo and Xu Liyi gasped. This elder was clearly a Soul Formation peak with chaos power—no one in the Wuxing Sect matched her.
