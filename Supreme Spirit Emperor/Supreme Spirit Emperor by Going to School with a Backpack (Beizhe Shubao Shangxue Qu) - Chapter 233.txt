“Kill!” Luo Tian had reached the peak of his fury. Though he knew the Blood Demon Sect was no ordinary sect, a mere heir possessed a pseudo-era treasure—perhaps it was a sect comparable to the sacred clans of the holy lands.

Yet Luo Tian hesitated not a moment, granting no chance for the Blood Demon Sect’s heir to explain. Fana’s Attack and Killing Art was infused into the Rupture Heaven Spear, and with a single thrust, it pierced the heir’s heart.

“Ah… I’ll fight you to the death!” The Blood Demon Sect’s heir, driven by desperation, unleashed an unrelenting will to survive. He roared aloud, his speed doubling in a desperate attempt to escape. At the moment the spear touched his heart, he carved out a path of survival—but still suffered devastating wounds, teetering on the brink of annihilation.

“You can’t escape!” Luo Tian observed the heir fleeing beyond ten thousand feet, his voice calm as he extended a golden palm, vast and overwhelming, striking the Blood Demon Sect’s disciples in the palace.

“Boom…” The golden hand descended like a divine punishment, leaving no room for resistance. In an instant, the disciples were reduced to meat paste.

After dealing with them, Luo Tian raised the Rupture Heaven Spear and activated Yin Shadow Ghost Step, pursuing the Blood Demon Sect’s heir.

A hundred youths trembled in fear, their faces etched with terror as they gazed upon the dozen semi-saints slain by Luo Tian’s palm. They knew they had been saved, for the demon-like youth who sought to use their flesh for healing was now being hunted by a warrior as fierce as a god.

Yet the youths dared not move, for they were ensnared in an encircling maze. At that moment, all they could do was pray Luo Tian would kill the terrifying youth and rescue them.

“Ah…” A harrowing cry echoed through the sky as Luo Tian, a god of destruction, relentlessly attacked the Blood Demon Sect’s heir. The heir fled in panic, and the two clashed across the Sumeru Continent, shaking countless sects. After all, a clash between early-stage saints was no trivial matter—such power made even the sects’ elders tremble.

“Luo Tian, I’ll fight you to the death!” The Blood Demon Sect’s heir, realizing escape was futile, turned with a mad expression and charged forward with an axe, no longer fleeing.

“Not running now?” Luo Tian’s face was cold as he wielded the Rupture Heaven Spear like a staff, slamming it down upon the axe.

“Crack…” Thunderous energy erupted between them.

In an instant, the Blood Demon Sect’s heir spat blood and was hurled into the ground, creating a deep pit that seemed to pierce through the continent.

“I’ll fight you to death! Blood!” The heir’s roar echoed from within the pit, his body radiating madness and blood mist.

“Boom… boom… boom…” A moment later, the heir burst from the pit, his body wreathed in blood mist, hair wild and eyes glowing with madness. His gaze turned bloodthirsty and fearless as he lunged at Luo Tian.

“Hmph, truly a sect heir!” Luo Tian’s face bore admiration as he sighed at the heir’s hidden reserves.

“Roar!” The heir howled, his axe slicing through the air with unstoppable might. Luo Tian’s eyes darkened—he could sense the heir had activated a secret technique to heal his wounds, at the cost of entering a temporary mad state.

“What does it matter? If you’re merely an early-stage saint, there’s nothing to fear!” Luo Tian chuckled, his body transforming into a golden storm as he unleashed Fana’s Attack and Killing Art.

The Sumeru Continent was small, but their battle sent shockwaves across it. Elders of various sects were jolted awake by the tremors, their faces pale with fear. They felt the power was beyond early-stage saints—far exceeding it.

In a blink, they clashed one hundred times. Luo Tian panted heavily, his robes torn and face etched with admiration.

The Blood Demon Sect’s heir fared worse, his body riddled with wounds and cracks, turning him into a bloodied figure. The mad state made him fearless of pain, driven only by the urge to kill.

Yet as time passed, the secret technique’s duration waned, and a glimmer of clarity returned to the heir’s eyes. His gaze flickered with fear.

“Use your treasure to subdue him!” Luo Tian smiled, raising his hand as a golden cauldron descended upon the heir with crushing pressure.

A pseudo-era treasure, when fully activated, could shatter the Sumeru Continent itself. To focus its might on a single target was no small feat.

“Boom…” Under the cauldron’s weight, the heir dissolved into a mist of blood, then reformed.

“Buzz…” As the heir began to take human form, a wizened figure materialized before Luo Tian.

“Boy, if you die, the Blood Demon Sect will eradicate you!” The old man’s voice was a threat.

“Hmph, a mere projection. You dare play god before me? Even if your true self came, I’d still kill you!” Luo Tian sneered. He knew the opponent was a powerhouse but remained unafraid, driving his spear through the illusion while green flames consumed the heir before he could fully reform.

Chapter 1016: Return to the Fire Domain

In a mountain range of the Sumeru Continent, a young man named Zi Mo paced anxiously outside the mountains. His face bore worry and urgency as he gazed into the range.

“I wonder how that elder is doing…” Zi Mo murmured, his eyes scanning the sky before returning to the mountains.

It had been a day since Luo Tian entered the range, and Zi Mo had waited outside for a full day. The time was agonizing; after Luo Tian’s entrance, he had heard a thunderous sound and seen two beams of light flee past him.

What troubled Zi Mo most was his younger sister—what had become of her? Yet with Luo Tian’s warning, he dared not enter recklessly. He could only wait outside, helpless.

“Buzz…” A ripple of energy passed, and a figure appeared before Zi Mo, causing his face to light up.

“Elder!” Zi Mo’s eyes sparkled with excitement, now addressing Luo Tian as a master rather than a peer.

“You’re injured!” Zi Mo noticed the bloodstains on Luo Tian’s robes, his face paling. Yet seeing Luo Tian’s calm expression, he realized no major harm had come to him and felt even greater admiration. This was a man who had annihilated their sect, yet now stood before him with blood on his robes—evidently, the enemy had been slain or driven away.

“This blood isn’t mine!” Luo Tian shook his head, unsure why he felt a strange fondness for this youth.

“Rest easy; the enemy is dead. I’ll take you in—I arrived too late, but I hope your sister hasn’t suffered!” Luo Tian shook his head and carried Zi Mo into the mountains with spiritual energy.

In a blink, they stood before the ruined palace. The cage remained intact; Luo Tian had not yet freed the youths and maidens, too preoccupied with pursuing the Blood Demon Sect’s heir.

The sight of Luo Tian and Zi Mo caused the hundred youths to tremble in fear, especially the children within the cage who burst into tears.

“Zi Ling!” Zi Mo scanned the group and immediately spotted his sister. He smashed the cage open, rushing to a crying girl around ten years old and embracing her.

“Big brother!” Zi Ling, upon being held, shivered slightly before recognizing her elder brother. Her tears flowed uncontrollably.

“Don’t worry; I’ll handle these people. I must go!” Luo Tian stood outside, his expression contemplative. Zi Ling’s talent was remarkable—already at the Soul-Formation stage for her age.

Seeing Zi Ling, Luo Tian thought of his own daughter. How long had it been since he left the Four Sacred Stars and the Tianyuan Continent? He wondered how his little one had grown.

“Sigh… If I can return to the Fire Domain, I’ll go back to the Four Sacred Stars. Then visit the Divine Beast Continent with Nan Gong Yuqing to settle the demon clan’s affairs, trying to awaken Yun Ting’s past memories and bring her back. After that, I’ll stay in the Four Sacred Stars—no more wandering!” Luo Tian shook his head, a longing for home stirring within him.

“Thank you, Elder! I beg you to take me as your disciple and serve you for life to repay your great kindness!” Zi Mo, seeing Luo Tian prepare to leave, felt desperation. He knelt, revealing his heart’s desire.

As Zi Mo knelt, nearly a hundred youths and maidens followed suit, their faces filled with gratitude. They had been doomed, but Luo Tian’s intervention saved them. In their darkest hour, it was Luo Tian who had come, and this debt of life could never be repaid.

Luo Tian gazed at the hundred youths—their talents were commendable, if not top-tier prodigies. With proper training, they could become a formidable force.

“Please accept me as your disciple!” Zi Mo’s face bore eagerness, his gaze on Luo Tian.

“What is your name?” Luo Tian asked softly, though he himself was in peril and had no time to take disciples.

“Latecomer Zi Mo, this is my sister Zi Ling!” Zi Mo respectfully replied, pulling the weeping girl beside him.

“I’ll give you a chance—but ultimately it depends on your own strength. I’ll grant you techniques, martial arts, and elixirs. If you can unify the Sumeru Continent, you’ll be my disciple. If not, then our paths simply don’t align.” Luo Tian extended his hand, and a storage ring appeared before Zi Mo.

“Of course, you may see this as a trial. If successful, go to the Holy City and find someone named Long Jie. Tell him you’re my disciple, Long Tian’s! Give him an elixir to prove your identity.” Luo Tian spoke before vanishing, leaving Zi Mo and the group in stunned silence.

Zi Mo clutched the vial, then suddenly realized Luo Tian’s name. His eyes widened as he stammered: “Luo… Luo Tian!”

“Ah, it’s him!” Zi Mo’s eyes sparkled with excitement. He recalled Luo Tian’s deeds in the Demon Domain, his heart trembling. To them, Luo Tian was a legend—killing sect heirs like slaughtering chickens, defeating late-stage saints with a bow. Who in the nine domains didn’t know him?

“I’ll earn your approval!” Zi Mo’s face was resolute as he clutched the vial, his gaze scanning the youths and maidens behind him.

…

At that moment, Luo Tian had already left the Sumeru Continent, concealing his identity as he flew toward the Fire Domain’s entrance.

Based on Luo Tian’s past record, unless a late-stage saint intervened, no one dared to provoke him. Even if someone recognized him, they would only whisper and spread his location. Some followed from afar, for now Luo Tian was an enemy of all sects. After all, three pseudo-era treasures in his possession could rival a sacred domain. Remember, the Eight Sacred Clans of the Demon Domain had only two pseudo-era treasures.

Luo Tian ignored their murmurs, knowing that once he entered the Fire Domain and reached Tongtian Mountain, protected by Gu Tianshu, no one could harm him. It was merely a burden for Gu Tianshu to replenish his life force.

Luo Tian walked through the stars, flying for seven days. The number of followers grew, but none dared to attack—only keeping a safe distance. Who knew if this killer would turn back or draw his Heaven-Devouring Bow to fire at them?

After ten days of flight, Luo Tian finally reached the Fire Domain’s entrance. His gaze was cautious; this might be his most challenging spot, the last chance to strike. He had killed so many from sacred domains; they wouldn’t let it go.

The entrance was eerily silent. Luo Tian stood still, his face calm as he gazed at the passage—only hundreds of feet away. Yet this distance was filled with overwhelming killing intent, preventing him from moving forward.

The two junior disciples of the Rhino Clan were already gone, no one left. Luo Tian called into the void: “Come out; hiding like a coward is truly a prodigy!”

“Luo Tian, I hear you’re stuck at early-stage saint. That’s a pity. Even with your reincarnation body, you can’t defy fate!” A mocking voice echoed from the void as a crimson figure emerged.

“Feng Jiutian! Do you think reaching early-stage saint makes you invincible? Forgot how I trampled you in the Ancient Heaven Palace? Or are you here to offer your flesh as food? I wonder if your blood still tastes good!” Luo Tian gazed at Feng Jiutian.

“Luo Tian, you’re already dead. Let me indulge in your death!” Feng Jiutian’s face darkened, recalling the humiliation in the Palace. Yet he quickly smiled again.

“Buzz…” A group of figures appeared, their auras radiating immense power. The Dragon Clan’s heir emerged—Luo Tian had never met him before, but he’d heard of him from Cao Dedu. His name was Long Xiyan, with bloodline so dense it approached ancestral rebirth.

At the same time, the Phoenix Clan’s heir, Jin Hongbo, also stepped forward, joining Feng Jiutian. Their faces were cold.

Other figures bore killing intent, clearly sect heirs from other domains. Luo Tian was surprised that the Starfield and Requiem Domains’ representatives weren’t present.

The Starfield Domain was understandable—his good relationship with Zhou Wei might have helped. But the absence of the Requiem Domain surprised Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian, your execution is deserved for killing my demon clan’s previous heir!” A youth cloaked in black mist glared at Luo Tian, his eyes filled with endless hatred. This was the new demon clan heir, eager to establish himself by killing Luo Tian.

Meanwhile, a man wreathed in lightning stood motionless, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian, his battle spirit sky-high.

“You’ve all come! You should thank me—without my killing your heirs, could you have ascended? Such a great debt, yet you seek to kill me?” Luo Tian’s words carried mockery as he eyed the lightning domain and demon clan’s heirs.

Chapter 1017: Slaying Heirs

At the entrance to the Demon Domain’s Fire Domain, several youths with immense blood energy stood there, their gazes filled with battle spirit as they faced Luo Tian.

“Do you seek to kill me for your path?” Luo Tian’s face was indifferent as he surveyed them. Though these heirs were troublesome, he had no fear. With the Heaven-Devouring Bow in hand, they would surely die painfully. The real threat was the two or three terrifying auras in the void, making Luo Tian’s heart tremble.

“Late-stage saint power!” Luo Tian frowned slightly, sensing the terrifying auras and deducing their cultivation.

“Trouble’s big. They truly don’t want me to live!” Luo Tian had no intention of fleeing; he knew he was outmatched by late-stage saints. The gap in strength was too vast.

These people were likely elders of sacred domains, coming to protect their juniors. Feng Jiutian was a prodigy—rare and destined for the Era-Transcendence realm.

Their purpose was simple: to test their juniors’ strength and, if successful, avoid their own involvement. After all, Cao Yuanshan’s threat was no joke.

“Luo Tian, today is your day of death. Are you ready?” Feng Jiutian’s face bore a smile, looking down with blood-red eyes. He had waited for this day long.

The other heirs also bore cold killing intent, drawing their weapons and gazing at Luo Tian.

“You’ve suffered enough! It seems the previous examples weren’t enough. Today, I’ll crush a few prodigies and leave you with scars!” Luo Tian had no choice but to fight fiercely, seizing a chance for survival.

“Enter the abyss!” Luo Tian roared, his face filled with battle spirit as he activated the Abyss State. Though mocking, these people were no pushovers—especially Feng Jiutian, whose blood energy rivaled the Era-Transcendence masters. Though not one of the Nine Bodies, he was no less formidable.

Black demonic energy surged skyward as Luo Tian’s face bore killing intent, his Rupture Heaven Spear wrapped in golden light. He activated Yin Shadow Ghost Step and vanished like a black lightning bolt, appearing before the demon clan’s heir.

“Since you’ve come to die, I’ll send you to meet Nan Gong Feibai!” Luo Tian sneered, thrusting his spear at the demon clan’s heir. The speed was unparalleled; the spear tip reached the heir’s throat instantly.

“You dare!” The demon clan’s heir’s eyes widened in panic, stunned by Luo Tian’s speed.

His cultivation was even inferior to Nan Gong Feibai; against Luo Tian, he had no chance. He exploded backward, a cold sensation on his throat as blood flowed down. The demon clan’s heir trembled in fear.

Meanwhile, the others’ attacks arrived instantly, striking Luo Tian with overwhelming power. The void was torn apart by their waves, creating vast black holes.

Numerous dazzling martial arts attacked Luo Tian, capable of slaughtering even late-stage saints—destructive and world-shattering.

“Dong…” A bell’s sound echoed, the Era Bell enveloping Luo Tian in divine light. He felt as if bathed in sacred radiance, impervious to all attacks.

“Boom… boom…” Thunder erupted outside the Era Bell, while within it, Luo Tian’s face bore cold determination. His spiritual energy surged; even within the Era Bell, that attack had shaken him.

“Kill!” Black demonic blades凝聚, their overwhelming aura radiating the Fana’s Attack and Killing Art. The seventh strike of the Seven Demonic Blades could annihilate a late-stage saint—any prodigy struck would die instantly.

The black blades surged forward, and the demon clan’s heir raised a shield of dark mist to defend. His heart trembled in fear, unable to fathom why Luo Tian targeted him.

“Crack…” The dark shield shattered instantly under the blade’s might, dispersing into a storm of black mist.

The blades surged forward, cleaving the demon clan’s heir in two. Blood splattered everywhere.

“Powerful!” Others’ faces darkened; Luo Tian was truly formidable. No one had expected him to kill the demon clan’s heir with a single strike.

“Those heirs only considered Luo Tian’s Heaven-Devouring Bow but underestimated his combat strength. Even without it, Luo Tian’s power is unparalleled. How could the reincarnation body be so easily killed!” Onlookers murmured, their faces filled with reverence toward Luo Tian.

Feng Jiutian and others’ faces darkened; they hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so invincible. Even with their combined attack, he had nearly killed one heir.

“Luo Tian, dare you not use the Era Bell?” The lightning domain’s heir shouted, thunderous roars echoing through space. Lightning crackled against the Era Bell but harmed Luo Tian not a bit.

“Then dare you fight me one-on-one?” Luo Tian retorted loudly, gazing at the lightning domain’s heir with a look of disdain.

“You’re from the lightning domain, truly lacking in talent! How could you be so foolish!” Luo Tian’s voice carried mockery.

The onlookers also glared at the lightning domain’s heir with contempt. They had surrounded Luo Tian, yet now demanded he not use the Era Bell.

“Same with the demon clan! I’ll clear out their trash. I wonder what kind of heir they’ll choose after your death!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed coldly, striking again with a blade. At the same time, he dashed toward the demon clan’s heir.

The blades arrived first; the demon clan’s heir, just reformed, was split again—more thoroughly this time, turning into a pool of blood. After the previous strike had wounded him, he was no match.

Feng Jiutian and others’ faces bore wild killing intent as they summoned their martial arts, unleashing their life-essence weapons without restraint. They knew they couldn’t hold back if they wanted to kill Luo Tian.

A phoenix’s cry echoed, its wings wielding a golden spear that radiated overwhelming might, transforming into a real phoenix to attack Luo Tian.

A dragon’s roar shook the heavens; a green dragon pierced through space, its sword forming a dragon spine to crush Luo Tian.

Thunderous roars echoed as colorful lightning transformed into a sea of thunder, attacking Luo Tian. The lightning domain’s heir, resembling a god of thunder, wielded a hammer and hurled it at Luo Tian.

Jin Hongbo and another heir also unleashed their ultimate techniques against Luo Tian.

The entire void darkened, the overwhelming waves seemingly intent on devouring Luo Tian as they surged toward him.

“Subdue!” Luo Tian sneered, ignoring the waves behind him. He extended his hand, golden light bursting from beneath a screen. A golden cauldron appeared, radiating overwhelming power and filling the onlookers’ vision.

The cauldron’s lid lifted, drawing in the attacks with an endless suction force, like a black hole.

“Lingyun Cauldron! This is the cauldron Luo Tian risked his life to retrieve from a late-stage saint’s heavenly tribulation!”

“Wow, having three pseudo-era treasures is great! One offensive, two defensive—no one can match Luo Tian in his rank!” Onlookers murmured, their faces filled with envy.

One person possessing three pseudo-era treasures—offensive and defensive—made him unmatched in his rank.

“Boom… boom…” The Lingyun Cauldron echoed with thunderous sounds, waves of lightning erupting from it. The cauldron trembled in the void.

Luo Tian ignored it; he knew their martial arts couldn’t destroy the Lingyun Cauldron. After all, it was a pseudo-era treasure; if it were so easily destroyed, he wouldn’t have survived this long.

At the same time, Luo Tian reached the demon clan’s heir, whose blood body was still reforming.

“Sizzle…” Green flames ignited in the void, casting an eerie glow across the stars.

Luo Tian flicked his finger, and green flames appeared on the demon clan’s heir, beginning to refine his blood.

In an instant, the demon clan’s heir dissolved into a wisp of black smoke and vanished into the void.

“Too fierce! He actually dared to kill! That’s a demon clan heir, and he’s gone in an instant!”

The onlookers murmured, their faces filled with awe as they gazed at Luo Tian. They hadn’t expected him to actually kill the demon clan’s heir.

Feng Jiutian and others’ bodies halted, their faces displaying disbelief as they stood still.

A group had come to kill Luo Tian with overwhelming force, but now, he hadn’t even expended effort to eliminate the demon clan’s heir. This left them feeling uneasy.

“Don’t be in a hurry; it’s your turn next!” Luo Tian smiled, scanning the group again before dashing toward them. Each step he took caused vast voids to collapse, his form resembling a humanoid beast.

“Kill!” Feng Jiutian and others knew no words could be spoken; they unleashed their spiritual energy, surrounding Luo Tian as thunderous roars echoed through the void.

Three elders sat in meditation within the void, their faces obscured by mist, even unable to see each other.

“Reincarnation Body is truly powerful—comparable to the might of a young Era-Transcendence master, even surpassing it!” The three elders spoke solemnly, their voices filled with admiration.

Chapter 1018: Unleashing All Cards

In the void at the Demon Domain’s entrance, vast stars continuously collapsed. The onlookers gazed in awe at the battle unfolding before them, their hearts trembling.

“Another heir of the demon clan has died—five in total at Luo Tian’s hands! This is only what we’ve seen; it’s said several more died in the Ancient Heaven Palace!” Onlookers murmured, watching Luo Tian protected by the Era Bell but still spitting blood.

Though powerful, Luo Tian was struggling against several early-stage saint heirs. Yet the onlookers still marveled at his record—truly a killer of sect heirs, always leaving one or two dead in his wake.

The three elders in the void closely observed the battle, ensuring their juniors weren’t accidentally killed by Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian thinks he has pseudo-era treasures?” Feng Jiutian’s face was cold as a deep dragon roar echoed from his mouth.

“That’s the pseudo-era treasure left by Long Zhan Tian of the Demon Domain! The Dragon Emperor Seal!” Onlookers gasped, gazing at the golden dragon coiled in the sky.

“Seems they truly came prepared, even bringing out their clan’s pseudo-era treasures!” Onlookers shouted, realizing there were more than one.

“That’s Long Jie’s pseudo-era treasure!” Luo Tian’s face darkened, surprised to face the weapon of Long Jie.

“Irrelevant! The lightning domain has one pseudo-era treasure as well!” The lightning domain’s heir, Li Tianyi, coldly raised his hand. Thunderous roars echoed as lightning surged, a green hammer appearing before the onlookers.

“My god! That’s the lightning domain’s only pseudo-era treasure, the Heaven-Subduing Hammer! They’ve even brought it out! This is a decisive strike!” Onlookers gasped, recognizing the treasure’s origin.

Two pseudo-era treasures hovered above Feng Jiutian and Li Tianyi, their bodies wrapped in radiant light. The dragon clan’s heir gazed at the Dragon Emperor Seal with envy—this treasure should belong to his clan, yet it was now in the phoenix clan’s hands.

A senior elder in the void bore a complex expression, recalling his clan’s decision. The return of Long Zhan Tian after reincarnation should have been a joy, possibly leading the dragon clan to rise again. Yet his clan was divided into two factions—some allied with the phoenix clan, others wishing to retrieve Long Jie and cultivate him.

Though he was a dragon elder, he had his own burdens. Both factions were formidable, and even he dared not interfere.

This ambush of Luo Tian was something he hadn’t wanted to attend. Everyone knew Long Jie and Luo Tian’s relationship; killing Luo Tian would clearly push Long Jie against the dragon clan.

But the dragon clan needed pseudo-era treasures, and the best way was to take them from Luo Tian.

Luo Tian gazed at the two treasures above their heads, his heart sinking. His greatest advantage was having multiple treasures, but now both had brought out two pseudo-era treasures—clearly disadvantageous.

“Luo Tian, you’re doomed today!” Feng Jiutian’s body radiated nine colors of light as he loomed over Luo Tian, activating the Dragon Emperor Seal to crush him.

Meanwhile, the green Heaven-Subduing Hammer surged with overwhelming might, lightning crackling across its surface. Li Tianyi wielded it to strike Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s face was grim as he chanted seals, black runes etched onto the Era Bell.

“Die!” Feng Jiutian’s face twisted with hatred, his hands pressing into the void. The golden Dragon Emperor Seal collided with the Era Bell.

“Dong…” A resonant bell sound echoed, shaking the entire Demon Domain. Onlookers were blown away, their mouths bleeding as they felt their internal organs shift. Their faces bore fear toward Luo Tian’s direction.

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian stood within the Era Bell, his seven orifices bleeding. His body was cracked and bloodied.

After the Dragon Emperor Seal, the Heaven-Subduing Hammer followed, striking Luo Tian. Onlookers held their breath, waiting for the result.

“This time he’s dead!” Feng Jiutian’s face was pale, his body trembling from the backlash. He had only managed to activate the Dragon Emperor Seal once due to his early-stage saint cultivation.

The green hammer surged toward Luo Tian, the Era Bell emitting mournful sounds. Cracks formed on its surface from the previous collision with the Dragon Emperor Seal. If it endured another strike, it might suffer irreversible damage.

“Lingyun Cauldron!” Luo Tian’s face bore madness as he grabbed the cauldron floating nearby, which instantly appeared above his head.

“Dong…” Green lightning split the void, surrounding Luo Tian with thunderous energy and obscuring the onlookers’ view.

Invisible winds surged, carrying lightning that struck the crowd, causing them to spit blood again. Yet none left; they all wanted to see if Luo Tian could create another miracle. They knew this time he might truly be doomed, even if he survived two attacks, he’d be severely wounded and unable to fight Feng Jiutian.

The lightning storm raged for half a bell, then calmed. Golden light appeared in the onlookers’ view.

Luo Tian stood in midair, flanked by the golden Lingyun Cauldron and Era Bell. Cracks adorned both pseudo-era treasures.

Luo Tian himself was worse, his body in tatters, no part unscathed. His arms were slowly regrowing.

“Spit…!” He coughed up black blood, gradually regaining his senses. His breath was heavy as green light spread across him, mending his wounds.

“Luo Tian, what do you have left to fight us with?” Feng Jiutian’s face was pale as he stood in the void, looking down at Luo Tian. This was what he had dreamed of for days—finally seeing Luo Tian in this position.

Jin Hongbo and the dragon clan’s heir, Long Xiyan, stood beside Feng Jiutian. The three radiated waves of power as they gazed at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian regained his senses, scanning the group: “Since today is my death, I’ll take a few heirs with me!”

He gazed at his newly regrown hands—tender and jade-like, then they were instantly wrapped in black mist.
