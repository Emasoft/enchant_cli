“Hmm…” Luo Tian nodded, not taking it seriously. Although his current state was poor, in this land without cultivators, he could still dominate.

Luo Tian followed the group down Tiger Head Mountain, his face carrying a faint smile. The Three-Headed Dog’s eyes were languid; these people were too weak to stir his interest.

After descending the mountain, the group led Luo Tian along a main road. Luo Tian learned that Tie Zhu’s village was called Tiger Head Town, where all the residents were people with tiger heads and human bodies.

“Tie Zhu, what will the town chief do with him?” The group kept glancing at Luo Tian as they walked, whispering among themselves.

“I don’t know. But he’ll probably have to pay back the chickens!” Tie Zhu shook his head lightly.

Luo Tian said nothing throughout the journey, feeling their simplicity as he followed them into a town.

As soon as they entered the town, Luo Tian’s expression slightly darkened. He gazed at the center of the town and lightly patted the Three-Headed Dog.

“Tie Zhu, you’re back! Hurry to the town chief’s house—he said a few deities have arrived. One of them is over ten zhang tall!” As the group entered the town, they saw people bustling about with curiosity.

“Tie Dan… what’s going on?” Tie Zhu, the tiger-headed man, grabbed a running tribesman and asked.

“Brother, you’re back! Who is he? The chicken thief?” The young tiger-headed man looked at Luo Tian with anger.

“Hmm, what happened?” Tie Zhu’s face showed confusion as he asked his younger brother.

“The town has received a few deities. Some are over ten zhang tall, others have wings—so impressive! They’re all at the town chief’s house now!” Tie Dan’s eyes lit up with excitement as he recounted.

“Deities? Let’s go see too!” The group’s curiosity was piqued by Tie Dan’s vivid description.

“Deities?” Luo Tian felt a slight shock in his heart, his gaze turning solemn. His vast spiritual sense instantly expanded, revealing every person and object in the town within his mind.

His spiritual sense then revealed a massive figure standing in the town’s center, its body towering over the modest courtyard. A surge of explosive power radiated from it, and its long hair flowed like a wild beast’s.

“Hmm?” Luo Tian felt a stir in his heart, recognizing the tall barbarian. He suddenly remembered—this giant was none other than Chu Chen.

Luo Tian was astonished; he never expected to meet Chu Chen under these circumstances.

Earlier, during his battle in the Underworld of Death, Luo Tian had been transported to the Origin Domain by the Book of Epochs and fell into the Barbarian Clan, where Chu Chen had saved him. Now, after suffering a severe injury and becoming an ordinary human, he had encountered Chu Chen again.

“Why is he here?” Luo Tian felt puzzled but then noticed a senior with wings and a Qingyi (Blue Robe) warrior from the Qilin Clan beside Chu Chen.

Luo Tian’s heart tightened; he didn’t believe these clan leaders had come to this land without cultivators just for leisure.

“Could they be searching for me?” Luo Tian’s eyes turned solemn. It wasn’t fear of them; he could sense their cultivation was only at the threshold of an epoch, and with his Three-Headed Dog, he had no reason to fear.

But Luo Tian was concerned about how to face Chu Chen if he truly came to capture him. Though they hadn’t met in years, he still remembered the warmth from the Stone寨.

As Luo Tian pondered, he followed Tie Dan and the others to the town’s center while his Three-Headed Dog was hidden.

“Hope there hasn’t been any change,” Luo Tian muttered, following the excited Tie Dan and others. His gaze fell on the familiar yet towering figure.

“What do you think? If you find this person, break this!” A young Yufeng warrior’s cold voice echoed as he addressed the trembling tiger elder.

“Yes, yes, Divine Lord!” The elder knelt on the ground, his face filled with reverence.

“Get up, old man!” Chu Chen’s deep voice rang out as he addressed the elder. The Barbarian Clan had migrated to the Nine Realms, bringing this land with them.

“Yes!” The elder and other kneeling tribesmen nodded respectfully, accepting a jade slip from the Yufeng youth.

“Let’s go. That human won’t have run to this desolate place,” the Yufeng youth muttered.

“This is boring. If I met that human, capturing him would be a great achievement!” The Qilin youth spoke.

“Prepare one hundred beautiful women from your tribe for me. After I enjoy them, we’ll leave. The tiger-headed people are quite intriguing!” The Qilin youth’s face showed interest as he looked at the crowd outside the courtyard, grabbing a full-figured tiger tribesman.

Chapter 1669: Let’s Talk Properly

“What?” Hearing the Qilin youth’s words, the tiger tribesmen’s faces changed. They hadn’t expected such a demand from them.

“Are they not deities? Why would they make such demands!” The townspeople murmured, their image of the deities beginning to crumble.

“Didn’t you hear? Old man!” Seeing their hesitation, the Qilin youth’s face turned annoyed. He grabbed the woman and started touching her.

“Sister…” Tie Zhu and Tie Dan were stunned, their eyes turning red as they rushed toward the Qilin youth.

“Please, Divine Lord! Free my sister!” They didn’t dare resist but rushed in.

“Qiru Xuan, don’t push too far!” Chu Chen’s face darkened as he addressed the Qilin youth, commanding him to stop.

“Chu Chen, we’re all men. These are just ants. What’s the point of caring?” Qiru Xuan sneered at Chu Chen, who was towering.

“Right, Chu Chen, don’t be so strict. One hundred is nothing. Let him use them!” The Yufeng youth smiled, trying to persuade but clearly siding with Qiru Xuan.

Luo Tian stood among the crowd, inwardly scoffing as he gazed at the Qilin youth. Yet he remained silent, wanting to see how Chu Chen would handle it.

“You’re overstepping! We allowed other clans to search here, but this is the limit. I won’t allow it!” Chu Chen’s face darkened, his voice booming.

“Good,” Luo Tian felt relieved upon hearing Chu Chen’s words. Over the years, Chu Chen’s character remained unchanged, bringing a faint smile to Luo Tian’s face.

“Don’t be so bold, kid! Today I’ll enjoy myself. What can you do about it?” Qiru Xuan sneered, his hands becoming unclean again.

“Also you, old man! Did you not hear me?” Qiru Xuan turned to the elder, his aura radiating slightly.

“You’re bullying us on our land! It’s not allowed!” Chu Chen’s face darkened as he glared at Qiru Xuan.

The entire Ancient Clans were searching for Luo Tian, but the Barbarian Clan wasn’t as eager. However, they couldn’t defy the clans’ will and had only conducted a token search while allowing other clan members to enter their territory.

Chu Chen had gained some fame in the Barbarian Clan over the years, earning the attention of the Wild City. He was assigned to guide the Qilin and Yufeng youths in searching for Luo Tian, leading them through this unremarkable land.

Throughout the journey, Qiru Xuan and the Yufeng youth had acted recklessly. Chu Chen had endured it, knowing they were two against one and couldn’t fight them directly.

But this time, their actions had enraged Chu Chen, pushing him to his limit and unleashing his long-held resentment.

“Do you think you can fight? Remember your status in the Barbarian Clan—just a stone寨 native. We’re both from our clans’ core, and if you fight, who will lose?” Qiru Xuan’s face turned cold. He had always disliked Chu Chen, who blocked his every move.

“Just a human,” the Yufeng youth smiled, joining Qiru Xuan with mockery.

“Fish find fish, shrimp find shrimp!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly as he approached Tie Zhu and Tie Dan.

“Get up. I’ll save your sister, and it’s repayment for the chickens. How about that?” Luo Tian smiled as he addressed them, who were still under Qiru Xuan’s pressure.

“What?” Tie Zhu and Tie Dan stared in disbelief, surprised Luo Tian dared to speak so boldly. After all, he was a deity who could kill them with one glance.

But as Luo Tian helped them up, the pressure that had made them powerless vanished instantly.

“You…” Tie Zhu’s eyes widened with shock, staring at Luo Tian. Even if they were simple-minded, they now realized Luo Tian was no ordinary person.

“Who told you to get up?” Qiru Xuan’s face darkened, seeing these ants dare to defy them.

“Brother…” The tiger tribeswoman trapped by Qiru Xuan called out to Tie Zhu and Tie Dan.

“Please, save my sister! Take as many chickens as you want!” Tie Zhu heard his sister’s plea and rushed to Luo Tian.

“Who is he? He looks unfamiliar. Not from our town, right?” The townspeople kneeling asked.

“He’s the chicken thief! How could he stand up?” Tie Zhu’s companions looked shocked, staring at Luo Tian.

“Just him?” Qiru Xuan sneered, laughing. The man before him looked like an ordinary human—nothing to him.

“Naive!” The Yufeng youth smiled too, unaware they were searching for the very person before them.

“Go back…” Chu Chen’s face darkened, then he gazed at Luo Tian, impressed yet puzzled by how this ordinary human had done it.

“Haha, long time no see!” Luo Tian chuckled and removed his Thousand Mirage Mask, revealing his true face. After all, no one here posed a threat to him, and Qiru Xuan and the Yufeng youth were already dead in Luo Tian’s eyes.

“You…” Seeing Luo Tian’s true face, Chu Chen’s expression changed, his gaze filled with disbelief.

“Big Brother!” Chu Chen stammered, never expecting to meet Luo Tian again under these circumstances.

“You… human!”

“Human! You’re Luo Tian!” Qiru Xuan and the Yufeng youth were stunned, their faces showing disbelief. They had indeed found Luo Tian.

They trembled at first, for Luo Tian’s reputation was infamous—many royal heirs had died by his hand, and several kings had bled at his hands.

“Haha!” But soon they felt Luo Tian’s aura and laughed uncontrollably, their excitement overwhelming. They could sense how weak he was now, feeling they could crush him easily.

“Heaven has a path you don’t take. I never thought you’d show up yourself. If you kept hiding, we wouldn’t have found you. Who gave you the courage to appear?” Qiru Xuan sneered, his excitement at having their target in hand. He tossed Tie Zhu’s sister away.

“A great achievement! I never thought this day would come!” The Yufeng youth’s face was also filled with excitement, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Boom…” As they pondered, a massive figure moved, grabbing Luo Tian with one hand and leaping into the starry void.

“Chu Chen, the Ancient Clans are hunting Luo Tian. Are you going to protect him?” Qiru Xuan and the Yufeng youth shouted as Chu Chen took flight.

“Big Brother, I know you’re smart, but why are you so foolish?” Chu Chen flew and spoke to Luo Tian. Though he had much to say, he knew it wasn’t the time. He understood Luo Tian’s current state—every clan in the Ancient Clans was searching for him, and just thinking about it made Chu Chen’s scalp tingle.

“Running?” As Chu Chen was about to leave the continent, two streaks of light appeared before him, their gazes cold.

“Damn!” Chu Chen’s face darkened; he hadn’t expected them to be so fast. He felt a bit uneasy, for their strength was no match for his. Plus, they held high positions in their clans and had stronger methods than him.

“Stupid kid, you think I have no chance?” As Chu Chen was anxious, Luo Tian’s voice echoed in his ear, making him pause slightly.

“Luo Tian, you’re dead today!” Qiru Xuan and the Yufeng youth said, their aura of Epochs surging as they formed two massive hands to strike Chu Chen.

“Xiaohei, kill them!” Luo Tian’s smile didn’t fade as he waved his hand. The Three-Headed Dog instantly appeared before Chu Chen’s massive body, its black form expanding dramatically.

“Roar…” A powerful suction force spread from the Three-Headed Dog’s three blood-red mouths, forming an invisible vortex that sucked in Qiru Xuan and the Yufeng youth’s techniques.

“This…” Qiru Xuan was stunned, his face pale as he stared at the Three-Headed Dog. He suddenly remembered a clan message—Luo Tian had a three-headed pet.

“Run…” Qiru Xuan and the Yufeng youth didn’t hesitate, lacking any will to fight the Three-Headed Dog and immediately chose to flee.

“This time, we brothers can talk properly!” Luo Tian didn’t chase the fleeing pair but smiled as he sat on Chu Chen’s shoulder, addressing him.

Chapter 1670: Entering the Wild City

“Roar…” A deep roar echoed in the sky as the Three-Headed Dog transformed into a black lightning bolt, rushing toward Qiru Xuan.

“Mother of god…” Qiru Xuan’s face turned pale, using all his strength to flee into the void. But in an instant, he felt a hot breath on his back, though it was just heat, Qiru Xuan broke out in cold sweat.

“Crack…” A blood-red mouth opened, biting down on Qiru Xuan. Blood splattered as the Three-Headed Dog devoured him, blood flowing from its lips.

“Xiaohei, you ate something again!” Luo Tian and Chu Chen returned to the ground, watching the Three-Headed Dog hunting Qiru Xuan and the Yufeng warrior. Luo Tian’s angry voice echoed.

“Ugh…” The Three-Headed Dog whimpered, then spat out Qiru Xuan’s corpse with a look of disgust.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian waved his hand, and the seven-color mark on his forehead glowed. Seven-color flames engulfed Qiru Xuan’s corpse.

“Sizzle…” A charred scent spread through the world, leaving the tiger tribesmen speechless and kneeling before Luo Tian in reverence.

“Even a chicken thief is a deity…” Tie Zhu and the others trembled, gazing at Luo Tian sitting on Chu Chen’s shoulder.

As everyone was terrified, the Three-Headed Dog also spat out the Yufeng warrior into Luo Tian’s seven-color flames.

A heart-wrenching scream echoed through the world, and all people on the continent looked terrified at the beautiful seven-color flames in the sky.

“Done, it’s compensation for all those chickens!” Luo Tian jumped off Chu Chen’s shoulder, smiling at the townspeople.

“Divine Lord…” The townspeople immediately knelt again, their eyes filled with fanaticism toward Luo Tian.

To the townspeople, Qiru Xuan and the Yufeng youth were deities. But this handsome young man had a dog that could kill them both.

“Big Brother…” Now Qiru Xuan and the Yufeng youth were dead, Chu Chen’s heart relaxed. His gaze was filled with excitement as he looked at Luo Tian.

“You’re so big, it’s uncomfortable!” Luo Tian smiled and sent a series of incantations to Chu Chen’s mind.

“Is this the method to change height?” Chu Chen looked puzzled, then his massive body trembled as he sat on the ground.

“Clean the blood from your mouth!” Luo Tian looked at the Three-Headed Dog, now back to a big black dog, frowning slightly.

“Ugh…” The Three-Headed Dog felt a bit委屈 (disappointed), but it opened its mouth, exhaling water vapor around itself.

“Miracle!” Seeing the Three-Headed Dog’s ability, the townspeople gasped again, their fanaticism increasing.

Many tiger-tribe women with some beauty in the town gazed at Luo Tian with shining eyes, making him instinctively shiver.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian felt uncomfortable, Chu Chen’s massive body emitted a series of thunderous sounds. Under the terrified gazes of the townspeople, he rapidly shrank down until he returned to normal human size.

“Big Brother! Where did you get this method?” Chu Chen’s face was filled with joy, gazing at Luo Tian. Even among the Barbarian Clan, few could master the method to change body size.

“Use it as needed. Get used to it. We haven’t seen each other in a long time. Tell me about the Stone寨!” Luo Tian smiled and addressed Chu Chen, then turned to the old town chief.

“Elder, can you prepare a room for us? My brother and I have some things to say. We’ll give you compensation later!” Luo Tian addressed the old town chief, though he had no money, but he estimated Chu Chen would.

“Divine Lord, your presence in our town is an honor!” The chief immediately bowed and spoke.

“Elder, no need for that. We are just ordinary people; it’s only our different races!” Luo Tian smiled with无奈 (helplessness), feeling the reverent gazes around him, and helped the old chief up.

“Yes!” The old chief nodded quickly, excitedly giving orders to the people around him. After all, having deities arrive was a top priority, and he could sense these two deities were different from the previous two.

“Hurry to prepare, and serve the Divine Lords some wine and dishes!” The old chief ordered the people around him. Then he respectfully led Luo Tian and Chu Chen, now back to normal size, into a courtyard—the town chief’s residence.

“Woof woof…” The Three-Headed Dog shook off the water, its eyes showing pride as it looked at Tie Zhu and others. It wagged its three heads and followed Luo Tian obediently.

Though the Three-Headed Dog looked proud, to Tie Zhu and others it was terrifying, making them almost fall to the ground. They remembered how they had once called this three-headed dog a beast.

“Tie Zhu, tell us how you met the Divine Lord!” The townspeople immediately surrounded Tie Zhu and others, their faces filled with envy.

“You don’t know what danger it was!” Seeing the people’s envious gazes, Tie Zhu and others felt a bit high.

“Hurry to prepare! The Divine Lord loves chicken, so prepare more!” Tie Zhu boasted a bit before addressing the crowd with a proud look.

“Got it…” The townspeople immediately started bustling, their faces filled with reverence as they looked at the town chief’s room.

…

“How have you progressed recently?” In the room, Luo Tian smiled and looked at Chu Chen with a sense of satisfaction.

“You’ve made more progress than me, Big Brother! Now you’re at the level of a great cultivator!” Chu Chen chuckled, looking at Luo Tian with respect. Luo Tian had always been someone Chu Chen respected; this hadn’t changed over the years.

“Alright, tell me how you’ve been in the Barbarian Clan and what about the people from Southern Ridge?” Luo Tian smiled again, asking.

“Good! We’ve now moved into the Wild City. Though we just arrived, I believe it won’t take long before we restore to our former glory!” Chu Chen’s face was determined.

“Excellent!” Luo Tian nodded, looking at Chu Chen with admiration. It was clear that Chu Chen had endured much to lead the people of Southern Ridge back into the Wild City.

“Big Brother, what are your plans next? Want to come with me back to the Barbarian Clan? After all, it’s still a bit unsafe for you outside!”

“I have some status in the Wild City now. If I take you back, it should be easy to hide you!” Chu Chen looked serious as he addressed Luo Tian.

“Hmm, it’s better to go with you. I’ve missed everyone!” Luo Tian nodded and agreed. After all, he was going to the Barbarian Clan anyway; it was better to go with Chu Chen. Though it was a bit dangerous, if he stayed low, there wouldn’t be much trouble. After all, Chen Zhan was also in the Barbarian Clan.

“Great!” Chu Chen’s face showed joy, clearly excited about Luo Tian joining him in the Wild City.

“But Big Brother, you’ll have to委屈 (sacrifice) a bit when entering the city!” Chu Chen’s face showed hesitation, clearly finding it troublesome to bring a human into the Wild City. However, he didn’t tell Luo Tian.

“No problem, I’ll handle it!” Luo Tian smiled, knowing well Chu Chen’s efforts. To collude with humans was a death sentence in the Ancient Clans, especially for Chu Chen who had no background.

“If this goes smoothly, I can help Chu Chen and the people of Southern Ridge improve their strength! At least no one will dare to bully them in the Barbarian Clan!” Luo Tian thought.

The two then had more conversation, and fragrant scents drifted in from outside. The townspeople’s faces were filled with reverence as they placed dishes on the table before Luo Tian and Chu Chen.

“Divine Lord, this is stewed chicken with mushrooms, lotus leaf chicken…” The old town chief respectfully introduced the dishes on the table to Luo Tian but made his mouth twitch.

The entire table was filled with chicken, with only a few side dishes—just a whole chicken feast. Luo Tian had eaten more chicken than anything else in these days, almost to the point of vomiting. Now the townspeople had prepared this table again, which looked very tempting but made Luo Tian have no appetite.

“Divine Lord, I know you love chicken; these are all prepared for you!” The old town chief smiled respectfully, looking at Luo Tian’s twitching mouth and bowed.

“Th… thank you…” Luo Tian didn’t know what to say. One was not wanting to trouble these ordinary people, and the other was not wanting them to mention the Three-Headed Dog’s chicken theft.

“Please, Divine Lords, enjoy your meal. Let us know if you need anything!” The old town chief smiled respectfully and then bowed out of the room.

“Eat!” Luo Tian picked up his chopsticks, eating with Chu Chen. After all, he hadn’t recovered yet and had to rely on food for sustenance.

After finishing their meal, they stayed overnight under the old town chief’s arrangement. The next morning before dawn, Chu Chen led Luo Tian out of this ordinary continent.

Before leaving, Chu Chen erased the townspeople’s memories, as if others came looking for Luo Tian, they might search their minds, causing trouble.

Luo Tian also didn’t disappoint the townspeople; after all, he had eaten their one thousand chickens. He left something behind that would activate when the town was in crisis.

After everything, Chu Chen led Luo Tian toward the Barbarian Clan’s direction.

Chapter 1671: Chu Chen’s Difficulties

As soon as Luo Tian and Chu Chen flew out of the continent, Chu Chen hid Luo Tian and headed toward the Barbarian Clan’s land.

The continent where Luo Tian had healed was under the Barbarian Clan’s jurisdiction, so it wasn’t far from the Barbarian land. After Chu Chen restored his massive body, he reached a colossal continent outside in less than half a day.

Chu Chen smiled and took a big step into the Barbarian Clan’s land, then flew toward the central city.

The Barbarian Clan’s continent in the Underworld was built similarly to the Origin Domain’s Barbarian Clan, with the central Wild City directly moved from the Origin Domain.

“Boom…” The massive body landed outside the Wild City, and Chu Chen stepped into it.

“Chu Big Brother is back!” Two giant Barbarians at the city gate smiled, looking at Chu Chen. They were familiar with him.

“Hmm, back. You two are doing well too!” Chu Chen smiled and greeted them before heading into the Wild City toward Southern Ridge.

The more central the area of the Wild City, the stronger the forces. Though Chu Chen had reached the threshold of an epoch and was qualified to live in the Wild City, he wasn’t the strongest. He was only qualified. Therefore, after walking for about a quarter of an hour, Chu Chen reached the area where Southern Ridge was located.

“Chu Big Brother!” As soon as Chu Chen returned, many people greeted him, looking at him with smiles and respect. After all, Southern Ridge’s Stone Clan had re-entered the Wild City thanks to Chu Chen alone.

“Chu Big Brother, you’ve been away for so long…”

“Yes, Chief, did you bring gifts for us?” Children surrounded Chu Chen with expectant faces.

“Of course!” Chu Chen smiled gently, like before, and loved the children of his clan. He waved his hand, and a mountain of new items piled up before each child.

“Go play!” Chu Chen told the children, then headed toward the Chief’s courtyard.

Now, Chu Chen was the Stone Clan Chief. The old chief had been unwell and passed the position to Chu Chen, returning to the Wild City without using the Stone Clan name. They still called it Southern Ridge because the Stone Clan had been forced out of the Wild City before, and using the Stone Clan name might cause trouble.

“Chief Chu!” Many tall Barbarians smiled as they greeted Chu Chen when he entered the Chief’s courtyard. These were people from his generation and had grown up with him, now adults.

“Chief, was it smooth?” Many clan members asked, their faces showing concern. Though Southern Ridge had improved compared to the Stone寨 before, it was still all thanks to Chu Chen. These people, though some had reached the peak of Sages, were still insignificant in the Wild City’s strong environment.

“Fairly smooth,” Chu Chen smiled slightly, but he didn’t mention killing Qiru Xuan and the Yufeng youth.

“Old friend, who is it?” People were confused, looking at Chu Chen with incomprehension.

“Boom…” Chu Chen didn’t speak and waved his hand, sending out waves of energy. Luo Tian’s thin figure appeared in front of the Southern Ridge people.

“Who is he?” Seeing Luo Tian’s small figure, their faces turned puzzled, then their massive bodies trembled.

“Luo…” A tall figure started to speak but suddenly closed his mouth, receiving a fierce glare from Chu Chen.

“Big Brother Luo!” A strong Barbarian man with a robust body approached Luo Tian, his eyes filled with excitement.

“Hello everyone!” Luo Tian smiled at the tall figures, but he quickly hid behind Chu Chen. His small body couldn’t withstand a slap from these giants.

“Who is he?” Then Luo Tian looked at the crowd, recognizing some but not others.

“Big Brother Luo, I’m Er Gouzi! We used to dig bird nests together!”

“I’m Dou Sheng!” One of the tall Barbarian men spoke, and others followed. When Luo Tian was in Southern Ridge before, they were still children; now they had grown into adults.

“Ah…” Luo Tian’s eyes immediately recalled the small figures who were taller than him even as children.

“Haha, I never thought you all had grown up!” Luo Tian smiled gently, looking at everyone.

“Big Brother Luo, I’m no longer called by my nickname! My name is Shi Dali!” Er Gouzi smiled proudly, as if showing off to Luo Tian.

“Big Brother Luo, why didn’t you come visit us for so long?”

“Big Brother Luo, why have you become like this? We heard you were…” Many of the children who had been close to Luo Tian looked at him with excitement.

“Luo Big Brother, I miss you too, but the situation didn’t allow it!” Luo Tian shook his head gently and spoke to them: “This form is only temporary. It’ll be fine after a while!”

“Haha, stay with us for a few days, Big Brother! Once you recover your strength, leave!” The crowd热情 (enthusiastically) invited Luo Tian to stay.

Southern Ridge’s Stone寨 had been destroyed by the Southern Ridge Sandstorm and the Yan Zhen clan. If it weren’t for Luo Tian, there would be no Stone寨 now.

Though they had moved into the Wild City over the years, the people of the Stone寨 were still simple and hadn’t forgotten those who had helped them.

They had heard of Luo Tian’s fame as a human and knew the Ancient Clans were now hunting him. But they didn’t care much, as this was the Wild City. If they were careful, Luo Tian wouldn’t leave Southern Ridge’s territory and would be safe.

“Alright, Big Brother is tired. Let him rest!” Chu Chen smiled and arranged for Luo Tian to stay in his residence.

“Big Brother, wait a moment. I need to inform the clan members. If someone spreads your news, it would be a big problem!” Chu Chen arranged for Luo Tian and then left the spacious room.

“Truly…” Luo Tian looked at the nearly hundreds of zhang-sized room, smiling bitterly. He was just not used to it. He also thought about Chu Chen’s thunderous snoring, and he felt regretful for following Chu Chen back.

His appearance might bring a disaster to the Stone Clan, though Old Sa Man had invited him from the Star Moon Divine Clan. But who knew if Old Sa Man would change his mind now?

“Since he’s here, let Xiaohei take the entire Southern Ridge away!” Luo Tian muttered.

“But strength is king. I should recover my strength first!” Luo Tian sighed longingly, but he was also confused. Last time he took the Reverse Blood Pill, he had become a human for a month but could clearly feel that his strength would return after a month.

But now, he felt it was impossible to recover his strength in just one month.

“Too injured!” Luo Tian sighed softly, then lay down and his eyes became heavy.

“Big Brother Luo!” As Luo Tian was drowsy, a loud voice startled him, as if thunder had exploded in his ears. His drowsiness vanished instantly.

“Boom…” The massive stone door made a heavy sound, and Luo Tian’s eyes showed bitterness. He stood up and walked out of the room.

“Dali, what’s wrong?” Luo Tian smiled bitterly, looking at Shi Dali standing at the tall door.
