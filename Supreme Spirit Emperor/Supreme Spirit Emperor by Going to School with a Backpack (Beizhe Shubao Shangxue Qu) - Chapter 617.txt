"Correct!" Luotian observed carefully before nodding. As the Holy Son of the Wheel of Hell, he naturally knew that the Eight Gates Lock Ghost Array was a grand formation for subduing hellish demons.

"Waa..." Just as Gu Qianxue's words finished, the illusion stone before them suddenly transformed, flashing dark light. Under everyone's cautious gaze, it became a plump baby crying incessantly.

"Why did it change?" The group's expressions shifted, yet they saw no anomalies.

"Regardless, we must first break this array. However, I fear it may be suppressing a terrifying entity; if so, we'll be in danger," Luotian murmured, his eyes filled with contemplation.

"Waa..." The baby cried endlessly, like a real infant, evoking pity. Gu Qianxue's hands moved, her fingers glowing with black patterns etched onto her forehead. A black eye appeared on her brow.

"It's a Seven-World Ghost Infant!" Gu Qianxue gasped, causing the group to feel a slight sinking of heart. Luotian's eyes also reflected disbelief.

"How could there be such things!" Luotian felt heavy, having seen records of ghost infants in the Wheel of Hell.

The formation of a vengeful infant occurs when an infant dies shortly after birth, and this happens across seven lifetimes. Thus, it accumulates immense resentment, rejected by reincarnation, becoming a ghostly entity that survives on the vitality of newborns. As it grows stronger, it can kill adults and cultivators but is purely vengeful, making it an abomination in both the heavens and hell. Hence, all must eradicate such entities.

"It can't be!" Fuxingyue listened to Luotian's explanation, gazing at the plump baby on the altar. He couldn't believe it was the evil thing described.

"The demon soldiers must be controlled by this ghost infant!" Luotian spoke, his gaze on the baby. He suspected that the illusion stone had merged with the ghost infant, making it a terrifying entity.

Chapter 2329: A Pig-Like Teammate

"Should we break the Eight Gates Lock Ghost Array or not?" Some hesitated, having heard Gu Qianxue and Luotian's descriptions of its sinister nature.

"Waa..." As the group doubted, the baby on the altar cried again. Its innocent gaze made Luotian and others momentarily dazed, feeling an urge to free it. This impulse was uncontrollable, leading them to gaze at the array.

"This is clearly a baby! How could it be a Seven-World Vengeful Infant? Monks are compassionate; I shall free this child!" Jiedu spoke, radiating golden light. He stepped toward the array and struck a stone pillar with his subjugation mace.

"Boom..." The mace slammed into the pillar, shaking it. Eight chains trembled violently.

"You're crazy!" Luotian watched Jiedu's actions, biting his tongue to stay alert. Yet it was too late.

The array wasn't simple; though struck by the mace, it trembled but remained strong, sending the mace flying. Luotian moved swiftly, appearing before Jiedu who caught the mace. He grabbed Jiedu's arm.

"Master Lu, you're committing a sin!" Jiedu shouted. Though not deceived by the baby's cries, his eyes remained resolute.

"I've killed more people than you can imagine; I don't care about this one!" Luotian grabbed Jiedu's head and kicked him away.

"Boom..." As Luotian kicked Jiedu, a thunderous sound echoed. The Star Moon Spear struck the pillar Jiedu had attacked.

"Dad, I'm coming to save you!" Fuxingyue's eyes flashed black as he swung his spear, whispering.

"Fuxingyue, I curse your ancestors!" Luotian cursed, leaping to block Fuxingyue. But Fuxingyue was a half-step Immortal King, and before Luotian could stop him, Fuxingyue's second strike fell.

"Boom..." The pillar finally shattered, releasing one chain from the baby.

"They've been ensnared by the vengeful infant! They see it as their own child!" Gu Qianxue shouted, her brow flashing black. She stood before Zhou Zhiwen who had also attacked.

"Boom..." Dragon's Abyss sword clashed with the Star Moon Spear. Luotian and Fuxingyue both retreated, colliding with the altar.

"Get your senses back!" Luotian roared, his Heavenly Human Dao technique enveloping everyone. His voice thundered in their minds.

Luotian's words made them pause briefly, but they resumed attacking.

"Buzz..." The Star Moon Spear pierced space as Luotian raised Dragon's Abyss to block Fuxingyue's strikes. Meanwhile, Gu Qianxue blocked Zhou Zhiwen, but Yin Xiu, Hun Xuang, and Jiedu had no one to stop them. They unleashed their techniques toward a pillar.

"Boom... Boom..." The thunderous impact shook the heavens. Under their combined attack, another pillar crumbled, reducing the baby's chains to four.

"Damn it! You bastards just cause trouble!" Luotian cursed, summoning Dahei and Erhei to block Zhou Zhiwen and Yin Xiu.

"Hun Xuang, stop!" Luotian shouted, activating the Mind-Seed Demon technique. But Hun Xuang seemed unaffected, trembling from the technique yet attacking relentlessly.

"I must save this infant!" Jiedu declared, his eyes resolute. Though not deceived by the baby's cries, it was the Buddha's compassion that drove him to attack with Hun Xuang.

"Damn!" Luotian's face darkened, fending off Fuxingyue. Though he blocked him, he couldn't subdue him. Jiedu and Hun Xuang kept attacking, plunging the scene into chaos.

"There's no choice!" Luotian sighed internally. He dared not summon Fuxingyang, fearing he'd be ensnared too.

Gu Qianxue, Dahei, and Erhei kept attacking but couldn't subdue Zhou Zhiwen's group.

"Boom..." After a hundred breaths, the third pillar crumbled. The baby had five chains left. The black altar beneath it lost some divine power, while the black vortex above expanded twice as large, its demonic energy surging.

"What to do? What to do!" Luotian was truly at a loss. If he revealed all his secrets, he could kill Fuxingyue, but he couldn't do that. Even releasing the vengeful infant was a risk.

"Jiedu, stop!" Luotian's thoughts raced. He could only hope Jiedu, who hadn't been ensnared, would have a moment of clarity.

"Master Lu, saving one life is better than building seven levels of a pagoda. I can't let it go, even if it's a demon!" Jiedu spoke, his voice resolute.

"You're creating sin! Do you know how many lives this thing has taken!" Luotian cursed.

"Then I must guide it to virtue, cleansing its sins!" Jiedu replied. Luotian nearly spat blood—whether from Fuxingyue's attack or Jiedu's words, he couldn't tell.

"Boom..." As they spoke, the fourth pillar collapsed. Luotian's face darkened. He glanced at the vengeful infant, his heart sinking as he saw black mist in its eyes. Its limbs began to move, and the remaining four chains trembled.

"Damn it!" Luotian cursed internally. His eyes turned ruthless, clashing with Fuxingyue again. Using Fuxingyue's strength, he flew toward the altar. He knew no other way but to risk it and kill the vengeful infant.

In a flash, Luotian reached the baby's head. His hands gripped Dragon's Abyss as eight ghost veins erupted, pouring demonic energy into the sword.

The blade's intent shattered heaven and earth. Luotian's body descended, but his heart sank as he saw the baby's contemptuous gaze.

"Boom..." The black Dragon's Abyss sword struck the baby, sparks flying. A wound appeared on its body. Luotian was also sent flying by the immense recoil.

"Cough... Cough..." Luotian coughed up blood, watching the wound on the baby. Blood flowed onto the altar.

"Damn it!" Luotian cursed, readying another strike but too late. Fuxingyue attacked again.

The baby slowly climbed the altar, licking its own blood. Its eyes darkened further, and the remaining four stone pillars trembled violently.

Misfortune struck again as Jiedu and Hun Xuang finally shattered the fifth pillar.

"Nothing fears a strong opponent, but pigs make terrible teammates!" Luotian cursed internally. He gave up, readying the Heaven-Defying Stone to take Gu Qianxue and Fuxingyue with him.

"Take them and flee quickly!" Luotian sent a mental message to Fuxingyang. He had no choice but to protect himself; if the vengeful infant escaped, those in Star Domain might be in danger. The Heaven-Defying Stone couldn't carry them all.

"What's happening?" Fuxingyang retrieved his token, hearing Luotian's urgent mental message. His eyes darkened, sensing the severity of the situation. This was the first time he'd seen Luotian so anxious. He responded but received no reply.

"Everyone, follow me!" Fuxingyang said nothing more, shouting to the Star Domain people and leaping toward the Illusion Magic Ridge's exit.

"Boom..." The sixth pillar collapsed. Luotian gazed at the baby, his eyes heavy.

"Jiedu, I have a way to purify its demonic and ghostly energy, making it virtuous. Please stop Hun Xuang!" Luotian shouted, his voice filled with anger.

"Is it true, Master?" Jiedu's eyes lit up, asking Luotian.

"It's as genuine as gold!" Luotian shouted. He had no other choice but to deceive Jiedu, knowing he was foolish.

"Then I'll trust you this once!" Jiedu stopped Hun Xuang's steps.

Seeing Jiedu block Hun Xuang, Luotian sighed in relief. He gazed at the baby still on the altar.

"Now, we must make these fools清醒!" Luotian doubted if the remaining two chains could contain the Nine-World Vengeful Infant.

"Why am I and Qianxue, and Jiedu not controlled by the baby's cries?" Luotian wondered.

"It's the Fool's Flower!" Gu Qianxue shouted, making Luotian's heart jolt. He still waved his hand, summoning three Fool's Flowers into his hands and handing one to Gu Qianxue and Jiedu each.

"Go!" Luotian activated the Yellow River Step, taking advantage of a gap to slip behind Fuxingyue and place the Fool's Flower on his head.

"Buzz..." As the Fool's Flower touched Fuxingyue's head, he paused momentarily. Purification energy surged into his body, restoring clarity to his eyes. Gu Qianxue and Jiedu experienced the same. Zhou Zhiwen and Hun Xuang also regained their senses. Luotian moved swiftly, kicking down Yin Xiu who was fighting three dogs. The Fool's Flower made Yin Xiu freeze.

Chapter 2330: Nine-World

"What's happening?" Fuxingyue blinked, gazing at Luotian who had him underfoot.

"Master Lu, why are you stepping on me?" Yin Xiu spat out dirt, addressing Luotian.

"What else? I want to ask you! Why did you come here? Since entering the Illusion Magic Ridge, you've been caught in traps!" Luotian cursed furiously.

"Uh..." Zhou Zhiwen, Yin Xiu, and Hun Xuang were stunned by Luotian's outburst but soon blushed, recalling their actions.

"Kid, do you talk to your older brother like that? You insulted my grandfather! He's your master!"

"Wait until I see my sister, I'll report you!" Fuxingyue was also embarrassed but retaliated.

"You're an idiot!" Luotian's face darkened at Fuxingyue's words, adding him to the list of pig-like teammates.

Gu Qianxue furrowed her brows, feeling as if something had struck her heart. She gazed at Luotian.

"Everything makes sense now!" Gu Qianxue realized. Though she knew she had lost some memories, if she were truly Fuxingyue's sibling, there would be a connection. But now, Fuxingyue's "sister" clearly referred to another person. Thus, Luotian must have a wife. Gu Qianxue, though memoryless, was an outstanding talent of the Ghost King Sect and would never have two women for one man.

"Qianxue, let me explain. It's not what you think!" Luotian glared at Fuxingyue, making him shrink.

"Go away..." Gu Qianxue's cold voice made Luotian stop.

"I really want to strangle you!" Luotian gritted his teeth, making Fuxingyue laugh nervously.

"Master Lu is truly a genius! Having a family yet still flirting with Gu Qianxue!" Zhou Zhiwen and others looked at Luotian with more admiration.

"Shh..." As Luotian was about to explain, a piercing scream rose from the altar. The baby saw they weren't attacking the pillars anymore and stood up, trembling.

Crack... Crack...

The remaining two chains began to tremble violently. The stone pillars also shook, and the baby's appearance changed. Black mist spread, two sharp teeth emerged from its mouth, glowing with a cold light. Its head began to rot, revealing nine tiny faces on top of its head—each grotesque, their white skin turning rotten and covered in black scales.

"This..." Everyone's faces showed shock. Even Jiedu was momentarily stunned.

"Not seven, but nine! It's a Nine-World Vengeful Infant!" Gu Qianxue gasped, stepping back.

Luotian's face darkened. Seeing the nine heads on the baby's head, he knew Nine-World Vengeful Infants were more terrifying than Seven-World. Though Seven-World had appeared in hell, the Wheel of Hell had no records of Nine-World.

"Let me guide it!" Jiedu's face glowed with divine light. His wooden fish reappeared, and he began to chant, sending golden sutras toward the vengeful infant.

"Roar..." The vengeful infant's eyes flashed madness, roaring. Though bound by two black chains, it spat out an invisible wave that instantly shattered the golden sutras, scattering them like wind.

"Boom..." The vengeful infant shook its black arms. The stone pillars trembled violently.

"Let's go! This Illusion Magic Stone is unattainable. A Nine-World Vengeful Infant, fused with the Illusion Magic Stone—its strength is beyond comprehension. Even a true Immortal King's initial stage might not handle it!" Gu Qianxue spoke, addressing Luotian and others.

"How to go? We can't leave. Did your brothers escape?" Fuxingyue's face darkened. If they left, the vengeful infant breaking free would be a disaster for Star Domain's people.

"Boom..." As Luotian and others spoke, one pillar collapsed. Only one remained standing. The vengeful infant roared, emitting a piercing sound that made everyone dizzy.

"Try anyway!" Luotian's eyes flashed madness. He knew the situation; if they let it continue, they wouldn't escape. He had seen cracks forming at the base of the last pillar.

" Fool's Flower!" Luotian waved his hand, sending the Fool's Flower flying. He gazed at Gu Qianxue and said: "Use ghost energy to drive the Fool's Flower, purifying its soul!"

Gu Qianxue didn't hesitate. Her ghost energy surged from her hands, forming long chains of ghosts into the Fool's Flower.

"Buzz..." The Fool's Flower emitted a glow, descending onto the vengeful infant's head. Its black eyes showed slight fear but still roared.

The ultimate purification energy from the Fool's Flower radiated, landing on the vengeful infant's head. Meanwhile, Luotian took out his wine gourd and poured it onto the vengeful infant without hesitation.

"Chug... Chug..." Yellow River water poured from the sky, landing on the vengeful infant's body. Its black eyes finally changed, but the last pillar was stronger than others and held until the Yellow River water fell.

"Sizzle..." The Yellow River water landed on the vengeful infant's body, producing white smoke. It screamed in agony, its eyes showing pain.

Yellow River water and Fool's Flower were the strongest purification forces. Even a ghostly entity of an Immortal King would fear them. If another initial-stage Immortal King had come, they might not have handled it. But this vengeful infant met Luotian, a being who had walked out of hell.

Black mist rose from the vengeful infant's body, absorbed into the Fool's Flower. Combined with Gu Qianxue's ghost energy, the Fool's Flower bloomed another petal, reaching five petals. Purification energy intensified.

Yellow River water seemed to corrode the vengeful infant, even its seemingly impervious scales began to be purified, as if corroded away.

"Om!" Jiedu chanted, reciting sutras. The Buddha's light spread, making the vengeful infant scream more pitifully.

"Effective!" Zhou Zhiwen and others' faces showed shock. They gazed at Luotian standing in the sky, wondering what else he couldn't do.

Time passed slowly. The Yellow River water and Fool's Flower, along with Jiedu's recitations, took effect. The vengeful infant didn't break the last chain. On top of its head, nine baby faces had one withered.

"Ah..." Luotian sighed deeply. The wine gourd kept pouring Yellow River water, but soon he was stunned to find his Yellow River water had only half left.

"Damn it! Half the Yellow River water only destroyed one head!" Luotian cursed internally. He gazed at Gu Qianxue, who was also in poor condition from overuse.

"Boom..." As Luotian was distracted, the vengeful infant roared again, attacking the black stone pillar desperately. It knew if it didn't break free, Luotian's group might exhaust it.

"Let's all attack it!" Zhou Zhiwen, Yin Xiu, and Hun Xuang saw the vengeful infant's desperate attack. They felt they couldn't just watch.

"Buzz..." In an instant, four techniques flew from the four people's hands toward the baby.

The thunderous impact shook the heavens. The vengeful infant bore several wounds, and Yellow River water flowed into its body through the wounds, making it roar.

"Again! It must have hurt him!" Zhou Zhiwen's face showed a hint of joy, gathering his technique again. The group knew the situation and unleashed techniques toward the vengeful infant without holding back.

After half an hour of relentless attacks, the baby's nine faces had reduced to seven. However, Luotian's Yellow River water was nearly depleted. The last pillar also collapsed under the vengeful infant's relentless attacks.

"Damn it!" Luotian instantly retrieved his gourd, leaping forward to stand before Gu Qianxue and Fuxingyue. His eyes were tense, watching the vengeful infant.

The vengeful infant roared, its eyes filled with hatred. It deeply remembered the pain Luotian had given it. Freeing itself from its chains, the vengeful infant unleashed a terrifying aura. It inhaled the swirling black demonic energy above the sky, absorbing it into its body.

Black scales reappeared. A formidable pressure pressed on Luotian's group, and the surrounding thousand miles seemed to be enveloped by an invisible force. Black mist formed thousands of baby faces, each with different expressions—terrifyingly grotesque.

"Domain, Immortal King!" Luotian sighed deeply and communicated with the Heaven-Defying Stone.

"Take as many as you can. Don't let this vengeful infant discover!" Luotian prayed that Fuxingyang's group had already escaped the Illusion Magic Ridge. He had bought them nearly half an hour; if successful, they should have already left.

"However, this vengeful infant seems to have issues. It must have been injured by the Yellow River water and Fool's Flower. After all, those things are fatal to such entities!" The Heaven-Defying Stone's voice echoed in Luotian's mind.

"You mean we have a chance?" Luotian replied, gazing at the vengeful infant with newly grown black scales.

"You have those two dogs and your Ghost Control Seal. They should allow you to fight it, but you must perform beyond your limits! This is my feeling. Whether or not to fight is up to you!" The Heaven-Defying Stone replied, making Luotian ponder.

Chapter 2331: Each's Secrets

Under the black altar, Zhou Zhiwen and others trembled. They gazed at the domain that enveloped them, their eyes filled with despair as they watched the vengeful infant swallow the black vortex.

"Run! With this domain, we're no match for this vengeful infant!" Zhou Zhiwen shouted to the group, preparing his life-saving technique. He knew now was the time to fight desperately; their strength against an Immortal King was too great.

The vengeful infant gazed at Luotian's group, then roared. The countless baby faces on the domain also roared. Suddenly, everything within a thousand feet faded into black and white. The life force within a thousand feet vanished.

Invisible waves affected Luotian's group, a powerful aura beginning to devour their life force.

"Can't escape. There's only one path now!" Luotian shouted to the group. Within the domain, there was no escape unless they broke out of it.

"How to fight!" Hearing Luotian's words, Zhou Zhiwen and others looked grim.

"Ten Thousand Human Dao!" Luotian's hands moved swiftly, enveloping everyone in the Ten Thousand Human Dao. Meanwhile, Dahei and Erhei were summoned.

"Buzz..." A black Ghost Control Seal hovered above Luotian's head, emitting a suppression force against ghostly entities from the seal and Dahei and Erhei.

"Ugh..." Seeing the seal, the baby faces on the domain immediately showed fear. They cried and scattered wildly.

As Dahei appeared, his tongue extended, eyes filled with greed. He gazed at the baby faces, looking eager.

"Go!" Luotian didn't stop Dahei. He spoke to the two black dogs, while his hands marked another seal on his body—clearly preparing to unleash the Heavenly Demon's Body Break. Only then did Luotian have a chance at battle.

"You must now hold back, holding until I finish the Heavenly Demon's Body Break!" Luotian spoke seriously to Zhou Zhiwen and others.

As Luotian addressed them, Dahei and Erhei reached the domain's edge. They bit into it.

"Crack..." A crackling sound echoed. In the group's shock, the two dogs had actually shattered the domain and devoured it into their bodies.

"Roar..." The two black dogs seemed to have discovered the most delicious delicacy in the world. They roared, restoring their true forms and devouring the domain.

With the domain broken slightly, and with Luotian's Ten Thousand Human Dao加持, the pressure on them lessened.

"Roar..." At the same time, the vengeful infant seemed to have digested the black vortex. Its scales fully grew back, eyes filled with hatred as it rushed toward Luotian's group.

"Block!" Fuxingyue held his Star Moon Spear before the group. But as he stood, a streak of light struck his spear. Fuxingyue spat blood and was sent flying back, ribs breaking audibly.

"Crack..." The vengeful infant's speed was lightning. It instantly appeared before Fuxingyue, biting his neck—dangerously close!

"Buzz..." At this moment, Gu Qianxue moved. Blood-red patterns were etched onto a black sword. A ghostly shadow appeared, instantly materializing behind the vengeful infant and biting it.

"Buzz..." The black sword emitted a brilliant divine light, slicing the vengeful infant's small body.

The vengeful infant stood still, stopping its attack on Fuxingyue. It actively rushed toward the ghostly shadow that had bitten it, ignoring Gu Qianxue's sword. Among them, the vengeful infant felt the most threat from Luotian. Luotian's attack hadn't injured it, so in its mind, others couldn't harm it.

"Boom..." However, the vengeful infant miscalculated. Gu Qianxue, a ghost cultivator, could identify Seven-World Vengeful Infants. Though not as skilled at controlling ghosts as Luotian, she definitely knew the weaknesses of ghostly entities and how to deal with them.

The sword covered in blood-red patterns didn't strike the vengeful infant's body but its armpit. Sparks flew, and the vengeful infant's grotesque face twisted.

Black blood spilled out. The vengeful infant roared, its black arm swinging toward Gu Qianxue. Wind surged like a thousand ghosts howling. A blood-scented atmosphere filled the vengeful infant's domain, making everyone's faces change.

Gu Qianxue slashed a sword at the baby's hand. However, the blade was shattered by that wind, sending Gu Qianxue flying back and colliding with the barrier. The baby faces on the barrier instantly roared, surging forward to bite Gu Qianxue.

"Om!" Jiedu recited sutras, golden light emerging from his hands. A golden dragon formed and rushed toward the vengeful infant.

Meanwhile, Fuxingyue, who had been injured, also attacked. But instead of targeting the vengeful infant, he flew to Gu Qianxue's side and caught her.

"Damn it! This thing is no pushover!" Fuxingyue rescued Gu Qianxue and then flew toward the vengeful infant again.

"Zhou Tian's Mountain Shaking Impact!"

"Wan Gu Qingtian!"

"Hun Sha!" Zhou Zhiwen, Yin Xiu, and Hun Xuang unleashed their techniques. Thunderous impacts echoed as three techniques split into three directions, surrounding the vengeful infant.

A piercing roar rose again. The vengeful infant floated in space, its arms moving. Its five fingers' nails extended, glowing with a cold light. It turned once, ten cold glows flashing and met Zhou Zhiwen's three techniques.

The thunderous impact shook the heavens. The sky cracked, and lightning rose from it. Just ten glows shattered Zhou Zhiwen's three techniques. The remaining seven rushed toward Luotian and the group.

"Damn it!" Fuxingyue's face darkened. He held his Star Moon Spear before him, and the cold glows struck it. Fuxingyue's body was sent flying back again, spitting blood.

Others were also in a sorry state. However, they had time to block, but Luotian didn't.

"Boom..." A violent wave rose from the ground where Luotian sat. Dust obscured his figure, and he vanished from sight.

"Aow..." The vengeful infant roared loudly, flying toward Luotian's direction.

"Block! Luotian can't die!" Fuxingyue shouted. He knew Luotian better than anyone; even in more dangerous situations, Luotian had survived. He believed Luotian wouldn't die from this attack.

But Fuxingyue's speed couldn't match the vengeful infant. Soon, thunderous sounds rose from within the dust.

Boom... Boom...

Each collision shook the earth. Fuxingyue sighed deeply, then two beams of light shot out from the dust—Luotian's body covered in patterns and the tiny vengeful infant. One large, one small. Their black fists collided repeatedly. Divine patterns formed with each collision. Luotian's lips bled, but the vengeful infant remained unharmed. Even with wounds, they healed instantly, a terrifying self-healing ability that made Luotian bitter.

"My body is almost the same as his, but his self-healing ability is too变态!" Luotian cursed internally. He could only endure, as now only he could match this vengeful infant to some extent. Others could only block but couldn't stop it.

The thunderous collisions continued, and Luotian was relieved that the vengeful infant didn't fight with him in techniques. If it did, he'd be in trouble.

Time passed slowly. The large and small figures clashed repeatedly. Luotian gradually showed signs of exhaustion, as the Heavenly Demon's Body Break was a body-exhaustion technique. Moreover, it had been only several hours since his last use of the Heavenly Demon's Body Break, overloading his body.

"What to do? We can't just watch. Think of a way! At least let Luotian rest and catch his breath!" As Luotian fought, Fuxingyue's group became anxious. They knew if this continued, Luotian would inevitably lose.

"Everyone, don't hold back now. Use whatever techniques you have! This is about our lives!" Zhou Zhiwen addressed the group. He didn't believe they had left their sect without life-saving techniques.

"I'll go first!" Zhou Zhiwen said, his eyes fierce. He waved his hand, and a golden talisman appeared in his palm.

"Go..." Zhou Zhiwen spoke. In an instant, he hurled the talisman toward the vengeful infant. A terrifying wave radiated from it.

"Boom..." In an instant, a golden hand appeared and struck the vengeful infant.

"It's the arm of an Immortal King in the middle stage!" The group gasped. The golden hand, with one strike, shook the heavens and earth, emitting a destructive aura that pressed down on the vengeful infant.

"I said you definitely had last-ditch techniques!" Luotian's eyes flashed anger. He had fought the vengeful infant for so long, yet they still held back their techniques. Even when they almost died before, they hadn't used them.

Luotian retreated, and the vengeful infant followed. But the vengeful infant's speed was fast; the golden hand's speed was faster, instantly crushing the vengeful infant.

"Boom..." The vengeful infant's small body was like an arrow, shot into the ground. A hundred-foot crater appeared in sight.

"Buzz..." Before the vengeful infant could retaliate, the golden hand clenched its fist and struck again.

"Boom..." The earth trembled. It felt like an earthquake, even the vengeful infant's domain shook, showing how powerful these two attacks were.

Chapter 2332: Immortal King's Fall

Luotian panted heavily, using the gap to recover his injuries. After all, he didn't have the vengeful infant's terrifying self-healing ability.

"Though not as strong as an Immortal King in the middle stage, it's definitely stronger than one in the initial stage!" Zhou Zhiwen said with admiration, watching the golden hand dissipate. It finally returned to his palm as a golden bone.

"Master Lu, take this pill!" Yin Xiu spoke with regret, handing Luotian a jade bottle.

"A good item!" Luotian's eyes lit up upon seeing the bottle. Though sealed, it radiated a strong herbal energy. Just inhaling two breaths made his injuries heal faster.

"Boom..." Luotian didn't hesitate. He crushed the bottle with his hand, wind swirling around him. The rich herbal energy made his severe injuries heal instantly.

A green light appeared in Luotian's hand, the shape of a pill. However, it was only half a pill.

"Nine-rank!" Luotian's eyes narrowed. He felt the pill's uniqueness. He had seen eight-rank pills but never nine-rank Immortal Pills.

Though this pill was only half, the herbal energy surpassed what he had seen in eight-rank pills by a lot.

"This is our sect's Rebirth Pill. It can instantly heal any injury, even for Master Lu. And it can also recover like the vengeful infant—though it takes an hour and conflicts with three major injuries!" Yin Xiu spoke with regret, quickly explaining the pill's effects to Luotian.
