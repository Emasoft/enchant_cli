“Hum……” Luo Tian muttered to himself, and his dantian radiated waves of energy, causing a gentle expression to appear on his face. “Splitting Heaven Spear!”

Since Luo Tian had entered the Half-Saint realm, the Splitting Heaven Spear had always been cultivated within his dantian. When Luo Tian was shattered into blood mist by the mountain condensed by the Heavenly Dao, the Splitting Heaven Spear had also been crushed and suppressed. Later, with Luo Tian's blood rebirth, the Splitting Heaven Spear had also regenerated, fully entering the realm of Sacred Artifacts.

The clamor of battle resounded, and the Splitting Heaven Spear gave a low hum before appearing in Luo Tian's hand. A surge of bloodline power manifested within his grasp.

At this moment, the Splitting Heaven Spear radiated an overwhelming aura, as if it were a sovereign of the heavens and earth. Its unyielding momentum spread across its spear body, filling Luo Tian with joy.

Luo Tian possessed another Sacred Artifact, the Ten Directions Xuan Feather Drum, but compared to the Splitting Heaven Spear, he felt that the默契 (rapport) between himself and the spear was incomparable to any other Sacred Artifact. The Splitting Heaven Spear was Luo Tian, and Luo Tian was the Splitting Heaven Spear.

“I will create my own martial technique! Others can do it, so can I!” Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with determination. He placed the Splitting Heaven Spear across his legs and slowly closed his eyes, emitting waves of calculation from his body.

The spear moved with his thoughts. The Splitting Heaven Spear, now transformed into a golden Sacred Artifact, emitted continuous humming sounds and circled above Luo Tian's head.

On the other side of Tongtian Mountain, Long Jie's face was solemn as he gazed at the inscriptions left by Gu Tianyu. A contemplative expression crossed his face.

Especially when Long Jie saw the "Sin" beneath the Heavenly Dao's mark, fragments flashed through his mind, causing an inexplicable restlessness. The fragments were incomplete but depicted scenes of the world's collapse and destruction, terrifying beyond measure.

"Ahh……" Long Jie roared, his dragon's cry echoing from his mouth, sending shivers through the heart.

Long Jie took a deep breath, his eyes filled with pain. "What is it? Why can't I remember!"

"Don't overthink, focus on the cliff wall. When your strength is enough, you'll know. You've just entered the Superhuman realm; your foundation isn't stable yet. It's not advisable to rush into the Saint realm. First, cultivate the cliff wall and enter Half-Saint to adapt your strength before moving into the Saint realm. I'm sure everything will come back then," Gu Tianyu's voice seemed to carry magic, entering Long Jie's mind and calming him.

Long Jie nodded slightly. His gaze fell upon the cliff wall, and he sat in meditation in midair, closing his alert eyes and entering a state of contemplation.

"Alas..." Gu Tianyu sat beneath the earth, letting out a long sigh. His voice carried an indescribable meaning as he gazed at Long Jie hovering in the void and Luo Tian, who was deep in his own calculation of martial techniques.

"The chaotic age is coming. Become strong. I don't know if I can endure until then," Gu Tianyu said before the earth plunged back into endless solitude.

...

In Shanhai Pavilion, after the three sect masters discovered Luo Tian, they returned to Shanhai Pavilion. Now, the three sat in a grand hall, their expressions heavy with silence.

"Du Hongtao, Lu Han Tian, you two must state your positions. What should be done about Luo Tian? Should we let it develop?" Jin Jingtian's irritable voice broke the silence.

"This matter is beyond our control. The three Grand Masters have already learned of it. If we act now, it might anger the elders," Du Hongtao sighed softly.

"Yes, Jin Xiong, let's stay calm. Whether Gu Tianyu is alive or not remains uncertain. This matter involves too much. Let the three sect masters decide," Lu Han Tian said with a faint smile, trying to soothe Jin Jingtian.

"Lu Han Tian, your Fire Sect hasn't lost a single person. You don't feel any sorrow? Standing here and making sarcastic remarks. If Lu Tianyu had died, I'm sure the first to seek revenge on Luo Tian would be you!" Jin Jingtian's face showed disdain as he addressed Lu Han Tian.

"Also, Du Hongtao, don't think I don't know your intentions. You're still planning to marry your daughter to that kid, bringing him into Shanhai Pavilion. Now there's no Supreme Disciple in Shanhai Pavilion, so it's perfect to bring him here and strengthen the sect, right?" Jin Jingtian scolded Lu Han Tian before turning to Du Hongtao.

"Fool!" Both Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian's faces changed, speaking in unison with anger.

Both were the heads of the three sects, equal in strength to Jin Jingtian. Now that Jin Jingtian scolded them like this, it was hard for them to accept.

"Jin Jingtian, don't overstep. Go back to your Gold Toad Sect and dominate there. In my Shanhai Pavilion, you don't have the right to give orders! Tongtian Gate is right there. If you want to destroy it, no one will stop you. Go ahead!" Du Hongtao scolded back.

Lu Han Tian also coldly stared at Jin Jingtian, his meaning clear. However, since Lu Han Tian's Fire Sect was a temple focused on inner cultivation, he didn't scold aloud as Du Hongtao did.

Jin Jingtian was taken aback, seeing their cold gazes. He quickly regained his composure and bowed respectfully: "Master Du, Master Lu, I was a bit out of control earlier. My words were too harsh. Please don't take it to heart."

"Hmph..." Du Hongtao coldly snorted and didn't continue speaking. Lu Han Tian's expression slightly softened after hearing Jin Jingtian's words, but before he could speak, the three of them were startled.

"Go. The three of you go and investigate the situation directly. If Gu Tianyu is alive, then Fire Domain wouldn't belong to us three sects anymore. So we assume Gu Tianyu is alive but his strength has been greatly diminished. If your investigation confirms this, then eliminate that kid!" Wang Jianzhou's voice echoed in their ears, causing Jin Jinglong to display a delighted expression.

Chapter 910: My Own Martial Technique()

Under the dim red starry sky of Fire Domain, Du Hongtao and the other two men transformed into three golden lights, flying toward Tongtian Mountain.

They didn't bring any disciples from their sects but instead went低调 (low-key) to Tongtian Continent, aiming to investigate the situation. They had already prepared their excuses.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian sat on his bed, and ten days had passed since he entered seclusion. For these ten days, he remained in a state of emptiness.

But suddenly, Luo Tian's closed eyes lifted as he soared into the sky above Tongtian Mountain.

"Hum..." The golden Splitting Heaven Spear followed him instantly, landing in Luo Tian's hand. This caused the elders and disciples of Tongtian Gate to look puzzled, unsure why Luo Tian, who had been silent for ten days, suddenly appeared in the sky.

However, no one dared to disturb Luo Tian. Instead, they looked at him with reverence and anticipation, eager to see what he would do.

Under everyone's gaze, Luo Tian held the Splitting Heaven Spear. A thread of Daoic resonance radiated from him, and the golden Sacred Artifact spear continuously pierced through the air. Each strike possessed the power to completely annihilate a Superhuman.

"Powerful, truly powerful!" Song Yongkang and others looked at Luo Tian with reverence as he merged with the spear, continuously striking it in the sky.

Golden light spread out. A series of afterimages appeared around Luo Tian, even Song Yongkang, a Superhuman-level powerhouse, couldn't keep up with his speed. He could only see the golden spear's afterimages around Luo Tian.

"Ten... a thousand... ten thousand..." Countless spear images made people dizzy, unable to distinguish which was the true Splitting Heaven Spear.

"So fast! It's only been a few breaths, and he has already struck over ten thousand times. This speed is truly unprecedented in my life!" Song Yongkang's face showed admiration as he looked at Luo Tian.

"First strike!" As people were in awe, Luo Tian's voice filled with surprise echoed in their ears, causing them to be stunned.

"Hum..." In the line of sight, the dense spear images instantly merged into one, emitting a piercing hum and landing in Luo Tian's hand.

"Go..." Luo Tian waved his hand, and the Splitting Heaven Spear instantly vanished from his grasp, leaving people confused.

"What's going on? That's it?" The disciples of Tongtian Gate looked puzzled, not understanding why Luo Tian had created such a commotion but now it was so quiet.

Luo Tian's lips slightly curled upward. He waved his hand, and the Splitting Heaven Spear reappeared in his grasp. At the same time, a thunderous roar echoed through the sky.

Thousands of spear images sliced through the heavens, swirling above people's heads as if they wanted to annihilate the sky. A terrifying storm instantly invaded their minds.

"风云枪诀!" Luo Tian lightly laughed and spoke, looking at the thousands of spear images that seemed to tear apart the sky. He named his newly created martial technique.

"Disperse!" Feeling it was enough, Luo Tian pointed his hand. The golden spear technique storm formed a terrifying golden spear vortex with overwhelming waves, and countless terrifying thunderstorms continuously erupted from the center of the vortex. It rapidly swept outwards beyond Tongtian Continent.

The storm lasted nearly half an hour before stopping. The people of Tongtian Continent looked at Luo Tian with respect.

In ten days, creating such a powerful martial technique. Luo Tian's talent was truly admirable.

On the other side, Jin Jingtian, Du Hongtao, and Lu Han Tian calmly appeared outside Tongtian Continent. All three were at the Saint level, their speed reaching极致 (extreme). Now standing outside Tongtian Continent, they immediately felt a slight change in their expressions.

In their line of sight, a golden storm was sweeping toward them. Upon closer inspection, countless golden spears, each with an overwhelming presence, made the three men's pupils contract.

"What is this martial technique? Why do I feel a strong threat!" Du Hongtao's face was deep, looking at the golden spear technique storm and speaking solemnly.

"A spear technique. This kid, Luo Tian, I've never seen him use a spear. Does this mean there's another Saint-level powerhouse in Tongtian Continent? Considering the power of this spear technique, even a Saint at the middle stage would need to be cautious!" The three men exchanged glances, their expressions filled with deep concern.

"Did Gu Tianyu really not die? His strength has declined?" The three men's thoughts were filled with confusion as they looked at Tongtian Continent. It was clear that their first encounter with such a powerful martial technique made them feel uneasy.

"Let's not talk anymore. First, break this technique before it harms us; otherwise, it would be embarrassing!" Lu Han Tian smiled, his golden sacred power carrying an icy chill. The surrounding temperature instantly dropped.

Hearing Du Hongtao's words, Du Hongtao and Jin Jingtian nodded slightly. Their power surged, and powerful martial techniques instantly appeared in their hands.

"Hmph. No matter who performed it, trying to give us a warning is still far from enough!" Jin Jingtian's face showed disdain. His golden toad surged toward the golden spear technique storm of Luo Tian.

The three were heads of the three sects, and their strength was self-evident. Even Luo Tian had to be cautious. Although Luo Tian's technique was astonishing, it was just newly cultivated and lacked control, so it had been sent to the domain's outskirts. Its power was greatly reduced. Against the three of them combined, it only lasted for a few breaths before being scattered.

At the moment they scattered, Luo Tian returned to his residence and felt a change. He looked at the void outside and saw the three sect masters.

"Earlier than I expected!" Luo Tian's body flickered, instantly appearing at the domain's outskirts. He looked at the three sect masters and spoke aloud: "I wonder, what business do the three sect masters have with me on Tongtian Continent?"

"Indeed, the rumors are true. This kid has entered the Saint realm and used the strongest smelting method Gu Tianyu once used!" The three felt Luo Tian's aura and his crystalline green appearance, their hearts slightly tightened.

"Kid, you killed our two sects' disciples. Do you think that's it?" Jin Jingtian, although knowing Luo Tian was hard to deal with now, still maintained a lofty attitude.

"Haha, funny. They wanted to kill me, but they lacked the strength and were killed by me. That's their misfortune! What do you want? I, Luo Tian, will be next!" Luo Tian didn't care about Jin Jingtian's status as the head of three sects and directly refuted him. Their statuses were meaningless to Luo Tian.

"Regardless, they weren't your opponents; they wouldn't have taken your life! You shouldn't have killed them!" Jin Jingtian's face darkened, completely angered by Luo Tian's attitude. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

"Haha, truly funny. So I have to die before I can retaliate?" Luo Tian looked at Jin Jingtian as if looking at a fool, secretly sighing. Education was important; what kind of master would produce such disciples or descendants.

"Regardless, you killed our disciples. Don't you think you should give us an explanation?" Jin Jingtian pressed, speaking to Luo Tian with his aura locking him down.

"You people wanted to kill me. You lacked the strength and were killed by me. Now you come asking for an explanation? Are the three sects so domineering?" Luo Tian's voice was like a thunderclap, his golden light spreading out. He scanned the three sect masters without any fear and refuted them.

"You!" Seeing Luo Tian's strength, the three men's anger was all ignited by him. Their eyes carried ill intent.

"Kid, I've said before that breaking the marriage was the last time. Now you've killed my Shanhai Pavilion's disciple. This has reached my limit. Even if Gu Tianyu is alive, Shanhai Pavilion will capture you!" Du Hongtao's face was cold as he looked at Luo Tian and spoke solemnly. He still had some reservations about Gu Tianyu, so he didn't say "kill" but instead said "capture."

"Haha, young people, being too arrogant isn't good. As the disciple of Gu Tianyu's domain master, this is not good!" Lu Han Tian's face was calm. His deep eyes had snowflakes falling, and no one knew what he was thinking.

"Hmm?" Hearing Lu Han Tian's words, Luo Tian felt a stir. He glanced at Lu Han Tian and exchanged glances with him for a moment.

Others might not have noticed, but Luo Tian caught the flicker of surprise and respect for Gu Tianyu in Lu Han Tian's words.

"I'm not someone who eats grass!" Luo Tian's face showed disdain. He didn't want to argue with the three men anymore. His dantian emitted waves of ocean sounds, and golden and green energy intertwined from his body.

"Hum..." The golden Splitting Heaven Spear transformed into a cold light, appearing in Luo Tian's hand. His face was filled with battle intent.

"Kid, we are three Saint-level initiates. Do you really think that entering the Saint level makes you invincible? Just go with us quietly, and this matter will be settled. Otherwise, don't blame us for bullying you!" Jin Jingtian hadn't forgotten the Grand Masters' orders and directly stated their intention to take Luo Tian away, intending to test whether Gu Tianyu was still alive.

"Want to catch me? Then see if you have the ability!" Luo Tian coldly snorted. He pointed his Splitting Heaven Spear at Jin Jingtian and moved with the spear, instantly appearing in front of Jin Jingtian. His speed was like lightning, and his golden Splitting Heaven Spear carried the aura of tearing everything apart, rushing toward Jin Jingtian.

Seeing Luo Tian strike first and actually dare to attack them, the three men's minds were startled. Especially seeing Luo Tian's astonishing speed and the pressure from his spear, their expressions became heavy.

Chapter 911: The True Saint Battle()

Outside Tongtian Continent, under the starry sky, Luo Tian transformed into golden light and rushed toward Jin Jinglong. His aura was like a dragon, showing no respect for Jin Jinglong.

"Hmph, truly young and impetuous. You really think you're someone?" Jin Jinglong also refused to back down, his face showing a hint of killing intent. His golden sword was in hand, and he rushed toward Luo Tian as well.

In the blink of an eye, they collided. Golden sacred power spread from their collision, causing Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian's minds to tremble.

Golden lightning formed around them, striking the slightly red starry sky and causing it to explode.

After the thunderous sound, both Luo Tian and Jin Jinglong stepped back. Luo Tian's eyes carried a hint of excitement, while Jin Jinglong's face was filled with shock.

"Impossible!" Jin Jinglong's figure appeared ten thousand zhang away, looking at Luo Tian. His tiger's grip on the sword had already cracked and was self-repairing.

Luo Tian, however, seemed unaffected. He had only retreated dozens of zhang and radiated golden light without any damage. His long hair flowed, holding the golden Splitting Heaven Spear, as if he were a legendary war god.

"Jin Jingtian was suppressed!" Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian's eyes also showed disbelief. They clearly hadn't used their full strength, but the result was obvious—Jin Jinglong had taken a small loss.

"Indeed, the disciple of Gu Tianyu's domain master!" Lu Han Tian's eyes sparkled with light. He looked at Luo Tian and sighed softly.

"Kid, you've angered me!" Jin Jinglong's face showed a hint of anger. He was clearly suppressed by Luo Tian, which made him feel embarrassed.

"What if you're angry? I want to see what talent your Gold Toad Sect's head has!" Luo Tian's eyes were filled with battle intent. His hands quickly changed, and a golden震天印 (Thunder-Subduing Seal) with the aura of subjugating everything instantly flew from his hands, appearing above Jin Jinglong's head. A terrifying pressure made Jin Jinglong's body tense up immediately.

Jin Jinglong was a long-time Saint-level powerhouse, holding a high position and experienced. Facing the Thunder-Subduing Seal above the sky, he remained calm. His hands quickly changed, and a golden great cauldron emerged from his dantian, clearly his personal Sacred Artifact.

"One Cauldron Shakes Rivers and Mountains!" Jin Jinglong roared, his arms' veins bulging. He directed the golden great cauldron toward the Thunder-Subduing Seal in the starry sky.

"Hum..." After Jin Jinglong's incantation, the golden cauldron instantly expanded, carrying supreme aura. It seemed to be the master of the starry sky as it rushed toward the Thunder-Subduing Seal.

"Indeed, the head of the three sects is stronger than that Son Shengjie from the race. This Sacred Artifact cauldron is clearly not ordinary!" Luo Tian's eyes carried admiration as he looked at the golden cauldron radiating light in the sky.

Luo Tian's Zhen Hun Cauldron had already given him a powerful pressure, but compared to the personal Sacred Artifact cauldron Jin Jinglong had summoned, it was a world apart.

"Why did Jin Jinglong use his personal Sacred Artifact right from the start?" Du Hongtao's face was serious as he looked at the golden cauldron in the sky, speaking solemnly.

"Perhaps because Luo Tian is too strong. Jin Jinglong felt pressure and used his full strength right away!" Lu Han Tian's face showed admiration as he looked at Luo Tian in the sky.

Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian were both proud. They didn't want to fight with numbers, so they hadn't joined forces against Luo Tian. They believed that if they had acted together, Jin Jingtian would have stopped them. After all, Jin Jingtian was also one of the three sects' heads and had some self-respect.

As they spoke, thunderous sounds echoed under the starry sky. Golden sacred power waves surged and rolled endlessly.

The powerful Thunder-Subduing Seal collided with Jin Jinglong's Tuo Tian Cauldron and was instantly shattered, wrapping the cauldron.

"So strong?" Luo Tian saw his Thunder-Subduing Seal was shattered in less than three breaths and sighed inwardly, realizing he had underestimated Jin Jinglong slightly.

"Saint-level. After all, every Saint has their personal Sacred Artifact and cannot be underestimated!" Luo Tian sighed softly, his eyes showing no sign of discouragement.

"Since entering the early Saint level, I haven't truly fought with a Saint-level. That old man from the race was also wounded by me when I was at the Half-Saint level. When I entered the Saint level, he had no more strength to fight. Now this Jin Jinglong is a good test for me to see how much stronger I am than the true Saint level!" Luo Tian muttered in his heart, looking at Jin Jinglong's Tuo Tian Cauldron descending toward him. He clenched his fists and stood on the void, bearing the pressure from the Tuo Tian Cauldron and instantly appearing beneath it.

"What is he doing? Does he want to use his body to withstand the Tuo Tian Cauldron?" Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian's eyes widened, seeing Luo Tian's clenched fists with disbelief.

"Die! Do you really think my personal Sacred Artifact is as powerful as a Superhuman's?" Jin Jinglong's face showed disdain, looking at Luo Tian who had collided with his Tuo Tian Cauldron.

"Truly! This kid doesn't know, the power of a Saint-level Sacred Artifact is so terrifying!" Lu Han Tian's eyes narrowed. He couldn't understand why Luo Tian would do this.

After all, anyone could see that Luo Tian's Splitting Heaven Spear was also a Sacred Artifact level and likely his personal Sacred Artifact. Luo Tian should know the power of his personal Sacred Artifact.

But the fact was this: Luo Tian, like a reckless youth, was using his fists to withstand Jin Jinglong's Tuo Tian Cauldron.

"Crack..." A crisp sound echoed in the silent starry sky. Lightning struck the void, descending onto Tongtian Continent.

Under Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian's eyes, Luo Tian's golden-blue fists collided with the Tuo Tian Cauldron.

"Blocked!" The next moment, their eyes widened. In their line of sight, the Tuo Tian Cauldron with Luo Tian descended, but Luo Tian had suffered no damage.

"Die!" Jin Jingtian roared and sent golden sacred power from his hands, forming a golden dragon that flowed into the Tuo Tian Cauldron.

The power was overwhelming. The Tuo Tian Cauldron emitted a series of humming sounds, and the immense pressure again enveloped Luo Tian. Sweat dripped from his face onto the starry sky.

"Open!" Luo Tian roared, and his aura seemed to be pulled by the Tuo Tian Cauldron. His power surged again, and his second fist followed, striking the Tuo Tian Cauldron.

"Open!" Thunderous sounds kept coming out. Luo Tian seemed to have gone mad, striking the Tuo Tian Cauldron repeatedly.

The thunderous sound was overwhelming. Under the starry sky, terrifying waves continuously spread outward, causing Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian's clothes to flutter.

In their line of sight, Luo Tian's fists cracked open. Golden sacred blood continuously spilled out, and even more astonishingly, the Tuo Tian Cauldron that could subjugate all living beings finally flew backward. Even its golden body had cracks and many areas were indented.

"Ugh..." The Tuo Tian Cauldron seemed to have been wounded, emitting a series of mournful sounds and returning to Jin Jinglong's head.

Luo Tian wiped the sweat from his face. His hands' blood stained his face, causing him to slightly startle.

"Ultimately, I was injured!" Luo Tian gently touched his fists and smiled.

"This kid is a monster! Even Jin Jinglong's Tuo Tian Cauldron was cracked!" Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian showed disbelief, looking at Luo Tian standing there with only a wound on his hand. They were speechless for a moment.

"Only then is it interesting, you three fight together! Otherwise, trying to catch me is like dreaming!" The Splitting Heaven Spear returned to his hand. He pointed the spear tip at Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian, his voice carrying a provoking tone.

"Arrogant!" Seeing Luo Tian showed no respect for him, Jin Jinglong's face became even more angry.

"Arrogant or not, you are still my opponent. You can't even harm my body! Want to catch me?" Luo Tian's voice carried disdain, his eyes briefly scanning the three men.

"Kill!" Jin Jinglong finally couldn't bear Luo Tian's provocation and held back no longer. His hands quickly changed.

"Kid, you're not strong in your body? Today I'll show you what true body strength is!" Jin Jinglong's eyes were filled with killing intent. A golden toad image emerged from Jin Jinglong's hands and jumped into the starry sky.

"Golden Toad Transformation!" Jin Jinglong roared, his voice like a magic spell echoing through the endless starry sky. It caused Luo Tian's pupils to slightly contract.

"Golden Toad Transformation, I haven't seen Jin Jinglong use it for a long time!" Hearing Jin Jinglong's low roar, Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian showed a hint of admiration as they looked at the golden sacred power forming a golden toad in the sky.

The sound of a toad's call echoed. Under Luo Tian's cautious gaze, the golden toad transformed into armor and clung to Jin Jinglong's body. Finally, it slowly merged into Jin Jinglong's skin.

"Kid, I'll show you whether your strongest smelting method's body is stronger or my Golden Toad Sect's ancestral secret technique!" Jin Jinglong's face showed a sinister expression. His entire body was wrapped in golden light, as if he were a golden man, rushing toward Luo Tian.

"Then let's see!" Luo Tian spoke coldly. His voice carried confidence as his body radiated crystalline beauty, colliding with Jin Jinglong.

Chapter 912: Long Jie's Outburst()

Outside Tongtian Continent, the starry sky had been quiet for nearly half a month. Now it resounded with thunderous sounds again, causing Song Yongkang and Long Jie to frown.

"Someone is fighting outside the domain!" Song Yongkang and Long Jie flickered their bodies, instantly appearing at the edge of Tongtian Continent. Their expressions were serious.

"Three sect masters!" They had just appeared when they recognized who was attacking them.

"It seems they've finally come!" Song Yongkang's face showed bitterness. He looked at Luo Tian colliding with Jin Jinglong in the starry sky and sighed softly.

Song Yongkang knew that Tongtian Gate's greatest test had arrived. If this disaster was overcome, from now on, Tongtian Gate would be able to establish its roots in Fire Domain and instantly rise to the same level as the three sects. But it was too difficult. The three sects had ruled Fire Domain since Gu Tianyu and had been passed down to the present. How powerful they were! The three sect masters only showed their surface strength, and it was not something a single Saint-level Luo Tian could overturn.

As Song Yongkang thought, Luo Tian and Jin Jinglong collided violently. Both were confident in their bodies, so they abandoned martial techniques and fought with pure body strength. They hit each other's fists, reaching the ultimate violence.

Thunder resounded everywhere. The golden and green figures continuously intertwined, leaving Song Yongkang and Long Jie dazzled.

On the other side, Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian also showed admiration. They were at the early Saint level, and they could keep up with Luo Tian and Jin Jinglong's speed.

"Haha, it's exhilarating!" Luo Tian laughed loudly. He struck a fist toward Jin Jinglong's head, and Jin Jinglong also fiercely attacked, ignoring Luo Tian's punch aimed at his head. He was confident in his body.

"Hum..." They both hit each other and retreated simultaneously. The golden fist struck Luo Tian's head, cracking his skull but instantly recovering.

In that moment, Luo Tian felt his internal organs shaking. His mind was blank, and a dizzying sensation made him sway slightly. Blood continuously flowed from his mouth.

Jin Jinglong was no better off, spitting blood from his mouth. His eyes showed disbelief. He hadn't expected that even with the use of the Golden Toad Sect's secret technique, he couldn't defeat Luo Tian.

"Again! I don't believe today I can't capture you!" Jin Jinglong's eyes showed persistence. His gaze was filled with battle intent. For years, he hadn't felt such a fierce desire to fight. Today it was completely ignited by Luo Tian. His aura was overwhelming, and he rushed toward Luo Tian again.

"Are you afraid? In the same level, I am invincible. Even if you've lived so long, you'll still be under my feet!" Luo Tian coldly snorted. He wiped the blood from his mouth and showed no fear, flickering toward Jin Jinglong.

After catching their breath, the thunderous sounds echoed again under the starry sky. Terrifying waves spread outward.

They seemed to have met a formidable opponent, continuously colliding without using martial techniques. They didn't want to lose to each other in body strength.

Time slowly passed. Under the stunned gaze of Long Jie, Du Hongtao, and others, they fought for half an hour without a result.

Countless blood droplets continuously fell from the starry sky, causing people to be shocked. Four men watched them with admiration.

Finally, after a thunderous sound, both of their figures appeared in people's sight. At this moment, both were extremely battered. Their eyes met and showed mutual admiration.

"For so many years, in the same level, I've never fought with someone who could match my body strength. This Jin Jinglong is the first!" Luo Tian's face showed admiration. His entire body was cracked, and blood enveloped him.

Jin Jinglong was the same. His whole body was broken, as if it could break at any moment. Any touch would turn him into blood mist.

"Last strike, decide the outcome!" They both spoke at the same time and extended their hands quickly.

The sound of a toad's call rose from Jin Jinglong's dantian. Jin Jinglong jumped high, like a golden toad, rushing toward Luo Tian.

"Hmm?" Luo Tian's eyebrows slightly furrowed as he saw Jin Jinglong flying above his head. His eyes showed a hint of caution. He could feel that Jin Jinglong was much better now.

"Can't do it!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with determination. He remembered the method he used on Ice Island in the Southern Region of Tianyuan Domain to withstand body strength.

"Speed!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a hint of cruelty. His hands quickly changed, and golden seal dragons wrapped him.

"Refining Body into Void, Instant Transmission!" Luo Tian's low roar echoed from his mouth. Under Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian's shocked gaze, Luo Tian's figure vanished from people's sight.

"Teleportation!" Lu Han Tian exclaimed. His calm eyes widened, looking at the starry sky where Luo Tian had stood before, his expression filled with disbelief.

"It's really teleportation. I didn't expect Luo Tian to have this technique. No, I didn't expect this technique actually exists. It's not a martial technique; it's a divine one!" Du Hongtao also couldn't believe it. He hadn't expected there to be such a divine technique, and they had never seen one before.

If Du Hongtao knew that he had personally delivered this divine technique to Luo Tian, he would have regretted it and beaten himself.

Jin Jinglong also hadn't expected Luo Tian to have this technique. Teleportation was an absolute life-saving asset. No matter how many strong opponents surrounded him, as long as he used it, no one could stop him.

Dazed, Jin Jinglong's figure quickly fell but lost Luo Tian's trace.

In the next moment, a wave of sound spread. A thunderous sound echoed, and in people's sight, Luo Tian instantly appeared before Jin Jinglong. He collided with Jin Jinglong again.

Jin Jinglong, having lost his guard, hadn't reacted in time. He was struck by a powerful impact on his body.

"Boom..." Blood splattered everywhere. Under Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian's stunned gaze, the head of the Golden Toad Sect, Jin Jinglong, turned into a blood mist and floated in the starry sky.

"Jin Jinglong was defeated by his most confident body strength!" Du Hongtao exclaimed in disbelief. He hadn't expected the result to be like this.

"Haha, my brother is invincible!" Long Jie shouted, his voice filled with endless pride. Then he looked at Luo Tian and narrowed his eyes: "Brother!"

In the line of sight, a figure in extreme disarray continuously fell toward the starry sky. It was clearly no longer capable of fighting, and even flying was hard to sustain.

Luo Tian's current state wasn't good. He could only let his body fall continuously, but even though he had shattered Jin Jinglong's body, he wasn't much better. His entire body was in pieces, and even his bones were all broken.

Fortunately, Luo Tian was now at the Saint level. His recovery was fast, but it would take some time to fully recover.

After recovering for a few breaths, Luo Tian's figure finally stopped ten thousand zhang away from Du Hongtao and others. After a few breaths of recovery, Luo Tian could stand up despite his internal energy still shaking. At least he could fly.

"Brother!" Long Jie's figure appeared beside Luo Tian, his eyes filled with concern. He supported Luo Tian up and saw the cracked body. His eyes showed waves of killing intent, looking at Jin Jinglong who was slowly gathering his blood.

Blood rebirth. Jin Jinglong was at the early Saint level, so he could definitely use blood rebirth. However, after recovering, Jin Jinglong was extremely weak and his cultivation had dropped significantly. He fell from the Saint level to the Half-Saint.

"Roar... You're going to die!" Feeling Luo Tian's injuries, Long Jie instantly turned his eyes blood-red and transformed into his true form. His entire body radiated golden light, rushing toward Jin Jinglong.

"Dragon Clan, bloodline power is so abundant!" Seeing Long Jie's true form, Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian were both surprised.
