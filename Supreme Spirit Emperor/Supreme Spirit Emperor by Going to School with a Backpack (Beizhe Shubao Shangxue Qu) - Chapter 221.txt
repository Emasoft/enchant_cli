“Even in its early stages, a Sage cannot yet activate the Pseudo-Era Treasure. Only when one reaches the peak of Sagehood can it be wielded!” The divine race’s people displayed disappointment on their faces, gazing at the clock-like artifact whose form had expanded.

In ancient times, the divine race’s former Supreme King once activated their Pseudo-Era Treasure. With its power, he overturned mountains and seas, his might overwhelming the heavens, subduing those who defied the divine race’s Sagehood peak. His presence was radiant and peerless. Yet now, as Luo Tian wielded it, though his aura surged like a storm, its power paled in comparison to when the divine race’s Supreme King had used it.

Even so, the golden ancient bell still made the lightning-shaped humanoid figure appear wary. Its right eye transformed into a shield, radiating golden light that became boundless divine brilliance, shielding the lightning-shaped illusion from its overwhelming purification force.

“Crack…!” Thunder roared as the golden Era Bell clashed with the shield, producing a series of brittle sounds, as if thunder had erupted from nowhere.

The golden shield could not withstand the Era Bell’s power and exploded with a terrifying storm that swept through heaven and earth.

“This is the might of a Pseudo-Era Treasure! If it were an authentic Era Treasure, how terrifying would it be!” Luo Tian’s spirit surged with excitement. His eyes flashed with brilliance; his golden divine power seemed inexhaustible, and he once more urged the Era Bell to descend upon the lightning-shaped illusion.

A spear was thrust forth, as if piercing time itself. The golden spear clashed again against the bell’s body.

Inscriptions reversed, and within his vision, the golden spear was invincible—yet it still met its end against the Era Bell, shattering into fragments of divine laws that scattered in all directions.

Luo Tian could not evade in time, and the golden shards sliced his cheek, blood gushing forth. The tearing sensation surged into his mouth, as if infused with the will of heaven and earth, rushing toward his dantian.

“Boom…!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with intensity. His golden dantian unleashed a tempest, neutralizing the tearing force imbued with heavenly will. At the same time, he formed hand seals, urging the Era Bell to descend upon the lightning-shaped figure now devoid of weapons.

“Boom…” Without defense, the lightning-shaped illusion could not withstand the Era Bell’s suppression and transformed into countless lightning serpents, scattering in all directions.

“Terrifying!” People’s faces bore awe as they gazed at the humming Era Bell in the sky, marveling at the might of the Pseudo-Era Treasure. The breaking of three bells symbolized the Heavenly Will’s Sage Trial—how astonishing!

Chapter 975: Heaven's Burden

Within the second-tier hall of the Ancient Celestial Palace, all eyes were filled with awe as they gazed at the golden Era Bell in the sky.

At the same time, people wore expressions of envy as they looked at Luo Tian. A Sage in its early stage possessing a Pseudo-Era Treasure coveted by all major sects—such an opportunity was truly beyond comprehension.

“Who among peers could rival Luo Tian, who wields the Era Bell?” People’s faces bore admiration as they gazed at Luo Tian, panting heavily.

“Is it over?” Luo Tian narrowed his eyes toward the sky, a sense of crisis rising within him once more.

“It should be over. Since even lightning-shaped entities have appeared, if anything else emerges, it would be an unprecedented omen!” Zhou Wei’s eyes flickered with calculation.

“Pfuit…” Yet, in the next moment, he spat blood, his eyes wide with disbelief before turning to fear.

“Luo Tian, be careful—there’s more!” Zhou Wei roared, his voice trembling. Even a slight quiver in his tone revealed the terror of what was to come.

“More?” People, hearing Zhou Wei’s shout, turned their gazes toward the void but saw no movement. Their faces bore confusion.

The eight great divine clans of the Demon Domain wore expressions of satisfaction. The Star-Seeking Domain was renowned for its divination, and since Zhou Wei claimed there was more, it meant the trial had not ended.

The previous lightning-shaped entity had already overwhelmed Luo Tian; without the Era Bell, he and Sun Mengru would have perished beneath the Heavenly Will’s thunder. If another trial emerged, even with the Era Bell, they could not resist.

“Just what kind of cultivation does Luo Tian possess that it still draws Heavenly Will’s trials?” People pondered, gazing at Luo Tian. With his entry, he now took Sun Mengru’s place in the trial. If Luo Tian succeeded, so would Sun Mengru; if he failed, both would perish in blood.

Luo Tian’s eyes were grave. Trusting Zhou Wei’s words, he felt a deep sense of alarm. His gaze was profound, unaware what terrifying thing would descend next.

“Could it be a true Heavenly Will’s manifestation? If so, then Luo Tian and Sun Mengru would have no chance at all!” A Sage in the early stage from the Star-Seeking Domain spoke, his voice trembling.

All hearts sank. If it were a Heavenly Will manifestation, Luo Tian had no chance at all. Legends spoke of prodigies who, during their Sage Trials, invoked the Heavenly Will’s manifestation—only to be annihilated, vanishing into the river of time without a single survivor.

“Hum…” At last, under people’s expectant gazes, the sky emitted faint ripples. Golden lightning coalesced again, but this time it did not form a figure.

“It’s not the Heavenly Will’s manifestation!” People sighed in relief, but their eyes widened as they gazed at the golden lightning coalescing into a character.

“Sin…” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with infinite divine radiance, gazing at the golden lightning forming a “Sin” character. His spirit trembled completely.

This “Sin” character was one he had seen before—etched on the back of Gu Tianshu. It had kept Gu Tianshu in perpetual silence, preventing him from leaving the hundred-mile range of Tongtian Mountain.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s face darkened, nearly cursing aloud. His gaze fell upon the golden “Sin” character now descending without movement.

“Unexpectedly, it transformed into a character—this “Sin”! Luo Tian’s actions have truly enraged the Heavenly Will. Though it is not a manifestation of the Heavenly Will, this “Sin” character is one no one can withstand!” Zhou Wei’s eyes bore terror.

The Heavenly Will had always been elusive, its existence unknown to people. Yet since ancient times, countless prodigies had perished beneath it. Some had risen with its blessing. There were those who, during their Sage Trials, had also seen characters descend to form their trials—though not “Sin,” but words of divine protection, leading to smooth progress.

Luo Tian’s body moved with lightning speed, grabbing Sun Mengru and fleeing. He did not want the “Sin” character to touch them. With Gu Tianshu’s example, Luo Tian did not wish for both of them to be trapped by this “Sin” character within the second-tier hall of the Ancient Celestial Palace.

Luo Tian’s speed was unparalleled, but the descending “Sin” character seemed to freeze space itself, locking onto him. It floated before him, pausing as if deliberating whether to settle on his back or Sun Mengru’s.

“Thank you! You’ve done enough for me. I’m happy!” Sun Mengru, understanding the terror of this “Sin” character, smiled and attempted to break free from Luo Tian’s embrace.

“I’ve told you—I owe you!” Luo Tian’s face bore a faint smile as he pulled Sun Mengru tightly into his arms. Knowing evasion was futile, he turned his back to the golden “Sin” character and pressed it against himself.

“Hum…” At the moment the golden “Sin” character touched his back, Luo Tian’s entire body trembled violently. He pushed Sun Mengru away with a sudden force and plummeted toward the ground.

“Boom…” Thunderous echoes filled the air as Luo Tian crashed into the earth again, his face pale and sweat pouring down.

At this moment, Luo Tian felt as if a mountain had been placed upon his back, rendering him immobile.

“Is that enough?” Luo Tian’s gaze turned to the sky, his voice filled with fierce anger.

“Hum…” As if sensing Luo Tian’s low growl, the sky’s ripples vanished. The golden resplendent palace reappeared in people’s sight. At the same time, Sun Mengru’s body emitted a deep rumbling sound, as if divine laws echoed. A terrifying aura suddenly surged from her body.

Sun Mengru did not suppress it, transforming into a streak of light before Luo Tian’s eyes. Her crystalline gaze met his.

“Nothing’s wrong!” Luo Tian merely replied with one sentence before falling silent, for the golden “Sin” character, though pressing upon his back and making him feel as if crushed by a mountain, had instead drawn him into his dantian. It wrapped around his entire dantian with an unseen force.

“It has isolated my divine power!” Luo Tian’s face darkened, sensing his golden dantian seemed sealed—no divine power could be used. This left him in shock.

“Crack…” Without divine power, Luo Tian could only rely on his flesh and blood to withstand the “Sin” character’s weight. His body emitted a series of cracking sounds.

“Hold on!” Long Jie and others’ faces darkened as they gazed at Luo Tian, who was suppressed by the Heavenly Will. They thought of Gu Tianshu.

Gu Tianshu had once been so brilliant, yet he was still crushed beneath the Heavenly Will at Tongtian Mountain. Luo Tian was equally brilliant, even surpassing Gu Tianshu in some ways—but their fates were the same.

“Does heaven not wish for our Fire Domain and Four Sacred Star Domains to rise?” Lu Hantian and Du Hongtao sighed deeply, their gazes filled with sorrow.

It had taken so long to produce Luo Tian; if he matured, he would surely lead both domains to rise. Yet now, he was crushed by the Heavenly Will.

“No!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with madness, but it was futile. The Heavenly Will was too terrifying. His mind raced through his hidden cards.

“Era Bell… Splitting Heaven Spear… Phoenix Ancestor’s Blood…” Luo Tian recalled one by one, but could not find anything that would free him from this predicament.

“Era Book!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with brilliance, recalling his greatest hidden card—the Era Book. Yet at this moment, the Era Book seemed to be a lazy old man, dormant within his mind.

“Hum…” Just as Luo Tian was about to despair, a golden light rose from his storage ring. A golden book floated out of the silk box within his ring—precisely a fragment of the Era Book stolen by Diaodezhu from Yan Hongtao, a warrior of the Shura Domain, during an auction.

After obtaining the Era Book from Diaodezhu, the Ancient Celestial Palace had immediately opened. Luo Tian had no choice but to place the Era Book in his storage ring without using it. Now, the Era Book had emerged on its own from the ring.

A flash of brilliance—The Era Book’s inscriptions transformed into a streak of light, covering Luo Tian’s back and gradually merging into his body.

At the same time, after the Era Book covered Luo Tian’s back, the “Sin” character representing the Heavenly Will dimmed significantly. Though it still remained, it lessened Luo Tian’s pressure considerably.

“That’s the Era Book! It was stolen by the Shura Domain during an auction!” Feng Jiutian and other members of the Demon Domain were stunned, their gazes fixed on Luo Tian. They were prodigies and elders of the Demon Domain, having once closely felt the fragment of the Era Book but gained nothing.

“How did the Era Book fragment end up in Luo Tian’s hands?” People bore surprise, gazing at Luo Tian. At this moment, Luo Tian seemed impossible to fathom.

Diaodezhu wore a triumphant expression, gazing at everyone. He longed to shout that the Era Book was his, but he dared not. If this were revealed, he would be branded a traitor by the Demon Domain, and even his father, Diaoyuanshan, would have no reason to protect him.

“Hum…” Luo Tian’s face improved slightly as he slowly rose, his gaze still grave. The Era Book swiftly entered his body and soon appeared around his dantian.

A sharp aura flickered briefly, as if severing some connection, allowing Luo Tian to once again use his divine power. His eyes lit up with joy.

After this, the Era Book flowed again and finally appeared in Luo Tian’s mind, joining with the Era Book within his mind to become more complete.

Chapter 976: Eternal Sagehood in the Early Stage

Within the second-tier hall of the Ancient Celestial Palace, Luo Tian slowly rose, his face filled with infinite admiration. He gazed at the void, a smile on his lips: “In the end, I’ve overcome it. What terrifying power does the Era Book possess? If it were complete, would it rival the legendary Era Treasures!”

Luo Tian had a feeling that if the Era Book were complete, it would possess the power to destroy heaven and earth. No one in the Nine Domains could withstand its might.

“Success?” Sun Mengru’s face bore a hint of joy, her body radiating brilliance. She appeared before Luo Tian like an ethereal immortal, emitting a terrifying aura of early Sagehood. Even Luo Tian was subdued by her power and hesitated slightly.

“Yes, it’s successful!” Luo Tian smiled faintly, reaching back to gently caress his back. Yet he felt something was off—this situation was not so simple.

Xu Liyi, Long Jie, and others bore great joy, immediately surrounding Luo Tian. Their eyes glowed with excitement. They had never expected Luo Tian to withstand the Heavenly Will’s punishment.

“The Era Book—why is it in your hands? It belongs to our Demon Domain!” Feng Jiutian’s face darkened as he addressed Luo Tian.

The members of the Demon Domain also bore grim expressions. People speculated that Luo Tian’s ability to withstand the Heavenly Will was surely connected with the Era Book. Without it, Luo Tian would have been crushed within this Ancient Celestial Palace forever.

“Rude!” Luo Tian waved his hand, slapping Feng Jiutian’s face. He sent Feng Jiutian flying with one slap.

At the moment he knocked Feng Jiutian away, Luo Tian’s face darkened abruptly. His gaze turned profound as he finally found the issue.

“I can’t cultivate anymore!” Luo Tian’s heart trembled, his eyes filled with shock and disbelief.

Sagehood masters replenish their divine power after each battle, their dantian constantly absorbing surrounding qi to nourish themselves.

Yet when Luo Tian had acted, he felt that although his divine power still replenished itself, it showed no signs of expansion. His entire dantian seemed like a lifeless pool with no movement.

“Damn it, heaven!” Luo Tian’s gaze turned profound as he stared at the void. He wanted to curse but held back, not wanting to worry others.

“Ultimately, I still haven’t fully resolved it. Does this mean I’ll forever remain at the early stage of Sagehood!” Luo Tian’s heart ached, sighing deeply.

“What’s wrong?” Everyone quickly noticed the flicker of sorrow in Luo Tian’s eyes, their gazes turning to him as they asked.

Sun Mengru wore a look of concern, gazing at Luo Tian. She remembered the scene where he had shielded her from the Heavenly Will’s trial and did not want anything to happen to him.

“Nothing’s wrong. Let’s move on to the next tier!” Luo Tian smiled faintly, addressing everyone. He did not wish to linger in this second-tier hall for long.

Everyone saw Luo Tian return to his usual self and sighed with relief, but their hearts felt unusually heavy. Especially Long Jie and Sun Mengru, who had fates intertwined with Luo Tian, could sense he was hiding something.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian moved swiftly, gathering the eight great divine clans and heading toward the next tier of the Ancient Celestial Palace.

“How strange this kid feels!” Those who knew Luo Tian’s character whispered, exchanging glances before turning their gazes to Long Jie. After all, Long Jie shared a blood bond with Luo Tian.

“I don’t know!” Long Jie shook his head, his clear eyes filled with worry. He transformed into a streak of gold and rushed toward the blood-crimson door.

“Ah… I hope nothing’s wrong!” Xu Liyi and others sighed deeply, their gazes profound as they rushed into the golden door.

“Fairy, we should go too. This time, your entry into early Sagehood has given us a slight advantage within the Ancient Celestial Palace. Besides Luo Tian, no one else can challenge you!” A senior of the divine race addressed Sun Mengru. With her entry into early Sagehood, she had become the strongest among them.

“Zhou Xiong, can you foresee what Luo Tian is hiding from us?” Sun Mengru did not answer but turned her gaze to Zhou Wei.

“I cannot. Even the domain master of Star-Seeking Domain cannot foresee it. Due to the Heavenly Will, Luo Tian’s fate is completely veiled; there’s no way to approach it!” Zhou Wei shook his head, dispelling Sun Mengru’s thoughts.

Sun Mengru pondered for a moment before her gaze flickered, her body radiating coldness. She gazed through the void as if returning to that icy and distant divine fairy, becoming a sharp sword. She led the divine race’s people into the golden door.

“We should go too,” Zhou Wei sighed, and the Star-Seeking Domain’s people transformed into stars, vanishing from the second-tier hall of the Ancient Celestial Palace.

As the few people disappeared, the second-tier hall gradually fell into silence. Soon after, an old man appeared within the hall, his eyes filled with a touch of沧桑 (sorrow).

“Being suppressed by the Heavenly Will, one is destined to defy it. If one can defy it, they may reach that step,” the old man’s eyes glowed with divine light, his gaze filled with a hint of amusement.

“Yet the Ancient Celestial Palace is not so easy to traverse. That fellow didn’t have my dislike for killing,” the old man stretched lazily, gazing at the blood-crimson door. His voice carried a touch of nonchalance.

…

As everyone entered the third tier together, their brows furrowed slightly upon landing.

Shouts of battle echoed as countless beast-like humans fought each other, the air thick with blood. The overwhelming scent of blood entered Luo Tian’s group’s perception.

The dense blood energy made people frown slightly, their gazes turning grave as they looked at the hall.

This hall lacked the brightness of the second tier, giving off a sinister feeling instead. The ground was littered with bones, radiating faint glimmers.

“Those are the bones of early Sagehood—who could extract blood from them? After all, even early Sagehood can regenerate with a drop of blood. Yet they’ve extracted every last drop!” People bore confusion on their faces.

What shocked Luo Tian’s group most was the blood-red sword hovering above the hall, resembling a demonic weapon. It absorbed the blood of those falling endlessly, appearing strangely ominous.

“Another Pseudo-Era Treasure!” People murmured in awe, gazing at the blood-red demonic weapon. Even within the second tier of the Ancient Celestial Palace, they had encountered two Pseudo-Era Treasures.

Feeling Luo Tian’s group’s arrival, the fighting people stopped their hands, gazing at the hall entrance. Their expressions slightly paused.

“Divine Race, Fire Domain, Four Sacred Star Domains, Star-Seeking Domain!” Someone roared, gazing at Luo Tian’s group with hostility.

Luo Tian observed these people as well. Previously, they had not attacked in the first tier; now, however, they seemed like enemies.

Especially when Luo Tian saw the demon clan people surrounded at the center, his face slightly changed.

At this moment, Nan Gong Feibai and other demon clan members bore grim expressions. Among those who had entered, the demon clan was the strongest and most powerful. It seemed they had conspired to attack the demon clan people, leaving them with only one early Sagehood elder and a half-Sage youth plus Nan Gong Feibai, totaling three people.

Seeing Luo Tian’s group entering, Nan Gong Feibai sighed deeply, secretly relieved that someone would share the pressure.

“Haha, another one has arrived! I said it was strange that this demon kid would ring the nine Era Bells!” Bloodlight surged as a sinister laughter echoed from the demonic weapon. A withered old man slowly appeared within people’s sight.

The old man was gaunt, his eyes fierce and terrifying, as if a demon from hell. His gaze was sinister, licking his lips lightly.

“Perhaps you don’t know me yet. Let me introduce myself first. I am the guardian of this tier. My name has long been forgotten, but unlike the previous one, I prefer blood. This bloodthirsty demonic sword has been refined by me for years and now reaches the level of a Pseudo-Era Treasure!” The old man’s sinister voice echoed throughout the space.

“Do you desire it? Are you enticed?”

“To obtain it, you must kill! See those red rings on people’s arms? The one with the most rings can try to claim this demonic sword!”

“To obtain these rings, you must kill. Kill one person and you’ll gain their ring. They say this tier is the bloodiest, so be careful not to be surrounded and killed! Kill, kill!” The old man’s words carried a hypnotic quality. People’s eyes turned wild instantly, and with the temptation of the demonic sword, everyone breathed heavily. They immediately surrounded Luo Tian’s group.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly, placing the Splitting Heaven Spear in his hand. His gaze gradually turned cold as he looked at the people around him, who seemed mad.

Though they had lost their minds, their intellect remained. They knew only by defeating Luo Tian’s group could they have a chance to obtain the demonic sword.

“Hmph!” Sun Mengru let out a cold snort, her golden spear ringing with brilliance. Her gaze bore endless coldness.

“Kill…” A half-Sage roared, charging toward Luo Tian’s group immediately.
