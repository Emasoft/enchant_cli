Luo Tian's eyes displayed a solemn expression. Though this was his first time employing the technique, it was evident he had studied it three times before. He had mastered its method to perfection.

"Crack..." The sky roared with thunderous sounds. Under Ding Hongfei's astonished gaze, the heavens seemed to tear open a rift.

"Is it not so?" Luo Tian finally smiled, gazing at the gray version of himself before him. He murmured softly.

Indeed, the gray Luo Tian's hands were also shifting, but his technique was clearly different from Luo Tian's.

"The fusion of martial arts techniques—Huangji Seal!" The gray Luo Tian executed the very same technique that had once been Luo Tian's strongest, the Yellow Rank Seal.

"Kai Tian!" Luo Tian bellowed, his face contorted with madness. His hands slowly descended.

"Boom..." Again, the golden seal emerged as if drilling from the sky itself. It felt as though this immense seal did not belong to this world.

"Fall!" Luo Tian snorted, his voice brimming with confidence. His gaze fell upon the gray figure already forming the Huangji Seal.

The gray figure apparently sensed that the heavenly Huangji Seal had solidified. Simultaneously, it thrust its hands forward. The Huangji Seal radiated an overwhelming imperial authority, rushing toward the Kai Tian seal that seemed slow but was already a thousand feet above the gray Luo Tian.

A single character "Tian" was inscribed upon the seal, colliding violently with the Huangji Seal.

"Pound..." The two massive seals clashed like two mountains, emitting a powerful thunderous sound.

Luo Tian's face showed admiration. This was his first time witnessing his own martial arts technique clashing with itself, evoking an indescribable feeling within him.

Both seals were comparable to a realm-level technique. The residual energy from their collision was beyond the capacity of an ordinary bone-subjugation realm cultivator to withstand. Fortunately, the people of Lishui City had evacuated it; otherwise, a single strike would have caused massive casualties among the city's common residents.

Ding Hongfei finally displayed a trembling expression. Under the two seals, he felt an intense threat. If he was careless, he would either die or be severely injured.

"Boom..." The thunderous sound lasted less than half a moment before fading away.

Luo Tian's face showed a hint of joy. In his spiritual awareness, after the collision between Kai Tian and Huangji Seal, although the Huangji Seal was immensely powerful, it still lagged behind the Kai Tian. Though it had delayed the Kai Tian for a while, the Huangji Seal eventually exploded in Luo Tian's sight, transforming into swirling spiritual energy.

Although the Kai Tian seal had weakened due to Huangji Seal's obstruction, it still crashed down upon the gray figure.

"Pound..." Under Luo Tian's spiritual control, the Kai Tian seal struck the gray Luo Tian like swatting a fly.

A storm of dust rose, revealing a massive pit in the sight of Luo Tian and Ding Hongfei. From above, one could see that the pit formed a massive "Tian" character.

The gray Luo Tian transformed into a wisp of gray mist, vanishing into the vastness of heaven and earth.

"It's over!"

"Finally over!" Luo Tian and Ding Hongfei both exhaled deeply.

Especially for Luo Tian, his face showed excitement. The three soul trials had each placed immense pressure on him. If not for a fortunate opportunity, he might have failed to pass the first trial.

"Buzz..." Under Luo Tian's expectant gaze, the swirling clouds above suddenly turned gray. A terrifying spiritual energy fluctuation made Luo Tian's eyes gleam with anticipation.

Under Luo Tian's expectant gaze, a seven-colored rainbow streaked from the gray storm clouds, piercing through heaven and earth.

It resembled a spiritual energy waterfall, instantly surging into Luo Tian's body.

"Hmm..." Luo Tian let out a soft sound, his face displaying comfort. He gently closed his eyes.

"Spirit Energy Vessel!" Ding Hongfei smiled, now that the danger had passed. However, he did not approach Luo Tian but remained in place. He knew that if he entered Luo Tian's range, spiritual energy would also descend upon him, which would be detrimental to Luo Tian.

"Crack..." A continuous sound echoed from within Luo Tian's body as spiritual energy entered. For some reason, his previous injuries instantly recovered.

Luo Tian opened his eyes and waved his hand, releasing Zheng Xin, Leng Qiuchan, and Ding Yuanshan's daughter.

"Pound..." As Zheng Xin and the others emerged, they displayed a tense expression. They had no idea what was happening outside the soul storage bag, so upon emerging, they instinctively drew their weapons.

"Ugh..." However, as soon as they appeared, Zheng Xin and the others were startled.

"I'm gone! This spiritual energy is so dense it's countless times more than in Wind Valley!" Zheng Xin displayed an astonished expression, standing within the seven-colored rainbow and shouting.

"Silence! Hurry up and leave!" Leng Qiuchan coldly snorted, lifting Long Baobao and heading toward the exit.

"Absorb it! I feel that this much spiritual energy is more than enough for me to enter the Yuanling Realm!" Luo Tian opened his eyes and smiled.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, the others displayed shock. They were not novices; they knew that the more bizarre the trial, the greater the spiritual energy returned. Now Luo Tian said this, implying how bizarre his previous trials must have been.

"Then I won't be polite!" Zheng Xin laughed, sitting cross-legged and beginning to circulate his spiritual energy to absorb the wind attribute spiritual energy within the rainbow.

"Pound..." However, as Zheng Xin just sat down, Leng Qiuchan kicked him up with one foot, muttering coldly: "Wait until he finishes absorbing it before we do!"

"Can't you speak properly! Always hitting me! Qiuchan, I tell you, this is wrong and immoral..." Zheng Xin stood up with a resentful face, staring at Leng Qiuchan's continuous complaints but did not resume absorbing the wind attribute spiritual energy from the seven-colored rainbow.

Chapter 446: Ascending to the Yuanling Realm

Chapter 446: Ascension! Yuanling Realm!

In the Eastern Region, Lishui City.

After a series of events, Lishui City could no longer be called by that name. The city was in ruins, with broken remnants and debris—calling it a wasteland would not be an exaggeration.

In the midst of this wasteland, Luo Tian sat cross-legged on the ground. A seven-colored spiritual energy rainbow stretched for tens of feet, piercing through heaven and earth as if connecting Luo Tian with the gray storm clouds above.

It had been seven days since Luo Tian sat cross-legged. Though his eyes were closed, he radiated a powerful aura that kept Zheng Xin and others at bay, pushing them beyond the range of the seven-colored spiritual energy dragon.

"Seven days! I've never seen anyone absorb spiritual energy for so long! What is his body made of!" Ding Hongfei displayed amazement, marveling at Luo Tian's ability to absorb such a vast amount of spiritual energy.

Zheng Xin, Leng Qiuchan, and Ding Yuanshan's daughter also displayed awe. Especially Zheng Xin and Leng Qiuchan, both prodigies of the Eastern Region and heirs of the Yuling Sect and Wind Valley. The two sects had sent them to observe Yuanling Realm cultivators' ascensions before, but they had never encountered anyone who could absorb spiritual energy for seven days.

As the group marveled, Luo Tian suddenly opened his eyes and gazed at the sky.

"It's now!" Luo Tian stood up, clenching his fists. His body, previously refined by the thunder trial, had reached saturation with spiritual energy.

"Golden attribute Yuanling! Form!" Luo Tian bellowed. The golden spiritual energy within the seven-colored dragon suddenly condensed, transforming into a lively infant-like spirit body.

This golden spirit resembled an infant yet also seemed like a beast without awakened intelligence, slowly circling above Luo Tian's head.

"Wood attribute Yuanling! Form!" Seeing the golden yuanling still solidifying, Luo Tian bellowed again. A green yuanling formed above Luo Tian's head.

"Water attribute... Fire attribute..." Luo Tian bellowed again. With each shout, a yuanling of that attribute formed.

The seven-colored yuanlings seemed to possess their own personalities, circling above Luo Tian's head as if searching for a father or home.

Luo Tian's eyes showed a smile. He extended his finger, and a drop of blood flew from his fingertip.

"Ugh..." As if catching the scent of something delicious, the seven yuanlings immediately flew toward the blood and devoured it completely.

After absorbing Luo Tian's blood, the seven-colored yuanlings shrank slightly, transforming into seven light points that continuously danced around Luo Tian. It was as if they had found their home.

Luo Tian smiled slightly, extending his hand to catch the seven light points. They emitted a faint sense of dependence. Without hesitation, he opened his mouth and swallowed the seven small things into his body.

"Buzz..." The seven yuanlings did not resist but instead seemed eager, entering Luo Tian's body.

Upon entering Luo Tian's body, the seven yuanlings immediately transformed into seven meridians that traversed his body.

"Boom..." Luo Tian seemed to undergo a massive transformation. His entire body's aura suddenly surged, evoking a feeling as if he were a child of this world.

Luo Tian felt that in the depths of his soul, he had completely stepped beyond humanity's realm. He now truly felt like a cultivator—a transcendence of life's levels.

Luo Tian also sensed that at the moment he entered the Yuanling Realm, his life's vitality had reached an astonishing ten thousand years.

"Ten thousand years!" Luo Tian's eyes showed admiration. He could live for ten thousand years! Ordinary Yuanling Realm cultivators only lived five thousand years, but he had doubled that. Moreover, as his cultivation advanced into the middle and late stages of Yuanling Realm, his life's vitality would continue to grow.

...

At the very moment Luo Tian entered the Yuanling Realm, a white-cloaked woman on the northern and eastern regions' North Sea displayed an ecstatic expression. The entire North Sea surged with colossal waves under her laughter.

"Roar..." A deep roar echoed from beneath the sea after the woman's laughter.

"Hmph... a mere soul-summoning realm water dragon dares to block my path. I was just looking for a gift for my son, and you've come knocking on my door!" The woman's face showed coldness. Her sword unsheathed, releasing a pale blue water attribute spiritual energy.

The North Sea, this mysterious ocean, instantly froze over three thousand miles under the woman's words. The white-cloaked woman's sword radiated a fierce aura, plunging into the frozen ice surface.

...

In the Southern Region's Icepole Island, a middle-aged man also displayed great joy. He murmured lowly: "Yue'er! Hurry and bring Tian back!"

"Go, check on this little one. Let your spirit body do it. I'll take care of things here for now." As the middle-aged man's words finished, an old figure emerged from the void with a smile.

"Senior!" The middle-aged man's face showed excitement, bowing respectfully to the old man.

"With my spirit body and your true self here, there shouldn't be any major issues!" The old man smiled.

"Thank you, Senior!" The middle-aged man's body trembled with excitement.

"Buzz..." As the middle-aged man was excited, his body emitted a strong fluctuation. Under the old man's smiling gaze, he seemed to split apart, revealing another middle-aged man's figure in their sight.

"One-tenth of a spirit body has already reached the Yuanling peak. It seems you've made progress these years!" The old man smiled, looking at the middle-aged man's true self.

"This place, besides the glaciers and that thing underground, is quiet enough for breakthroughs!" The middle-aged man's true self looked at the departing spirit body, his face showing anticipation.

"Those years have been hard on you and your wife. However, you'll know that your efforts will surely be rewarded!" The old man spoke.

"Having Tian alive is the greatest reward for us as a couple!" The middle-aged man's eyes glistened with tears, looking into the distance.

As Luo Tian entered the Yuanling Realm, the elders of major sects across Tianyuan Continent seemed to sense it. Their eyes gazed into the distance, and even their usually calm expressions showed a slight fluctuation.

Chapter 447: All Ascend

Chapter 447: All Ascensions!

"Buzz..." Luo Tian's face showed excitement. He communicated with the spiritual energy in the world, and instantly behind him formed a pair of seven-colored spiritual energy wings.

"Beautiful!" Leng Qiuchan's face showed rare gentleness, gazing at the massive spiritual energy wings behind Luo Tian.

"Roar..." The seven-colored wings trembled slightly, instantly lifting Luo Tian into the sky. He roared upward, as if releasing his pent-up emotions—no longer cowering or hiding, now possessing strength to go to the Yami Sect and rescue Gu Qiansnow and Gu Lei.

His long hair fluttered, Luo Tian stood atop the sky. A gentle breeze brushed his determined face, and an invincible aura rose from Luo Tian's body.

Leng Qiuchan, seeing this, was momentarily stunned.

"Qiuchan! You've fallen for a daze... Ha!" Zheng Xin's face showed disbelief, gazing at Leng Qiuchan. This was the first time he had seen her display such an expression.

"Pound..." Leng Qiuchan responded with a kick from her black boots, sending Zheng Xin flying. Her face blushed, as these days her emotional fluctuations had been too intense, yet she couldn't tear her eyes away from Luo Tian.

Ding Xiaoyan's face was bitter. She thought back to when she had repeatedly offended Luo Tian, but he hadn't held a grudge. Now that Luo Tian was an Yuanling Realm powerhouse, she remained at the late bone-subjugation stage.

"Quickly absorb! The remaining spiritual energy Luo Tian hasn't absorbed is good stuff!" Ding Hongfei marveled, reminding the others.

Hearing Ding Hongfei's reminder, their faces straightened. The storm clouds had dispersed, leaving only the spiritual energy Luo Tian hadn't absorbed. However, as Luo Tian stopped absorbing it, it slowly began to dissipate.

Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin didn't hesitate. They grabbed Long Baobao and rushed to the spot where Luo Tian had sat, circulating their spiritual energy to absorb the dwindling spiritual energy.

Long Baobao displayed a puzzled expression. However, the spiritual energy in the world flowed into the little one's body on its own, and it was no slower than Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin.

"Why aren't you going?" Ding Hongfei's face showed confusion, gazing at his two juniors.

"You should go too!" A faint voice echoed from the sky, falling upon the hesitant figures of Ding's daughter and son.

"Thank you!" Ding Xiaoyan's face showed complex emotions, gazing at Luo Tian who had landed beside her.

Luo Tian nodded. Though he didn't particularly dislike her, he wasn't especially fond of her either.

"Kid, I always thought you weren't simple. I didn't expect you to enter the Yuanling Realm so quickly! I've heard about your relationship with Xiaoyan. On my behalf, take her in. This kid isn't bad despite being arrogant," Ding Hongfei smiled as he saw Luo Tian land before him.

"Thank you, Senior. Otherwise, I might have died at their hands!" Luo Tian spoke with a smile, his eyes flickering with coldness toward the North Chang County.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Ding Hongfei knew he was going to North Chang County for revenge. He had seen Luo Tian chased like a stray dog before; now that he was in the Yuanling Realm, there would be no holding back.

"Be careful. North Chang County isn't as simple as you think. Even our five cities dare not easily move against it, hence the rule of only allowing entry and no exit!" Ding Hongfei warned Luo Tian.

"However, the kid who came out of North Chang County with you before—when he returned to North Chang County, he did have some achievements!" Ding Hongfei's face showed a hint of admiration, recalling Wu Di in North Chang County.

When Wu Di first entered North Chang County, Ding Hongfei had helped him several times. After all, in Ding Hongfei's view, Wu Di was closely related to Luo Tian. Helping Wu Di was also a way of making Luo Tian owe him a favor.

"Wu Di?" Luo Tian's lips curled into a smile, recalling the man who had once flattered him excessively.

"This kid is really good. Now he has completely unified the outer regions of North Chang County. Even the three major families of Beiming City failed to eliminate him. However, recently this kid seems to have some trouble. I had planned to help but was called here by Yuanshan!" Ding Hongfei suddenly remembered the situation in North Chang County and warned them.

In fact, after Wu Di arrived at North Chang County, he had continuously advanced through pills and recruited talents. Now besides Yuanling Realm masters, their strength was no worse than the top three families of Beiming City. The major families had attempted several sieges but hadn't gained any advantage, instead suffering heavy losses and giving up.

But recently, for some reason, the families of Beiming City had started another siege against Wu Di's group. Even an Yuanling Realm elder had come out to deal with Wu Di, so it was clear how much trouble Wu Di faced now.

Hearing Ding Hongfei's account, Luo Tian's eyes flickered with coldness. His lips slightly curled: "I hope you don't go too far."

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Ding Hongfei felt a chill. However, his gaze then fell upon the people sitting there, and a powerful fluctuation surged from their bodies.

"Roar..." A dignified roar echoed before them, making Luo Tian and Ding Hongfei display surprise.

Golden light suddenly rose. A golden dragon appeared in the sight of Luo Tian and Ding Hongfei.

"Long Baobao!" Luo Tian hadn't expected the first breakthrough to be Long Baobao. However, he soon understood—Long Baobao was his companion, and if he grew stronger, Long Baobao naturally followed. Conversely, if Long Baobao strengthened, his own strength would also increase. However, before this, both had been suppressed by the Nai Pan Dragon Seal. This effect wasn't obvious. Now that Luo Tian had entered the Yuanling Realm, the Nai Pan Dragon Seal was merely a bridge between them. The sealing power for both was negligible, so Long Baobao's ascension naturally followed.

Long Baobao's small body in their sight instantly transformed into a golden dragon several zhang long. Though only several zhang, they could feel the powerful fluctuation and the unique aura of a dragon.

"Ten zhang... twenty zhang..." The golden dragon let out roaring sounds, gradually growing to twenty zhang in length.

Luo Tian saw Long Baobao's body and displayed a strange expression. A strange thought popped into his mind: "Twenty zhang, should I be able to stand on it?"

Chapter 448: Departing for North Chang County

Chapter 448: Departing for North Chang County

Long Baobao's twenty-zhang golden body danced through the sky, then transformed into a dragon with big eyes. His eyes showed mischievousness. He opened his mouth and spat a golden attribute dragon breath toward Luo Tian and Ding Hongfei.

"Ah-choo..." A golden attribute dragon breath rushed toward Luo Tian and Ding Hongfei.

"Roar..." Like a golden long dragon, it roared and instantly appeared before Luo Tian and Ding Hongfei.

Luo Tian and Ding Hongfei displayed a hint of surprise. Then, Luo Tian took a step forward and punched through Long Baobao's dragon breath.

"Stomp... stomp..." Luo Tian took three steps back, his face showing a smile.

This struck Ding Hongfei differently. He had seen Luo Tian's strength before, but this seemingly innocent dragon breath had pushed the formidable Luo Tian back three steps. Long Baobao's strength was evident.

"Ha-ha..." Long Baobao giggled, transforming back into human form and landing before Luo Tian.

"Growing taller?" Luo Tian saw Long Baobao, who had previously been no higher than his legs, now reaching his waist. He smiled and lightly tapped Long Baobao's head.

"Buzz..." A spiritual energy fluctuation echoed again. Zheng Xin and Leng Qiuchan displayed a hint of joy, their bodies radiating strong energy that surged into the sky.

Their bodies continuously emitted clear sounds. Sweat dripped from their bodies.

"Bone-subjugation peak! Good!" Luo Tian's face showed satisfaction. For them to reach the bone-subjugation peak was normal.

They were both prodigies, having been at the late bone-subjugation stage for some time. Now they had absorbed spiritual energy capable of ascending to the Yuanling Realm, though it was what remained after Luo Tian's use. For bone-subjugation realm cultivators, this was an invaluable treasure.

"Ha-ha! I'm also a bone-subjugation peak powerhouse now. Just one step away, and I'll be in the Yuanling Realm!" Zheng Xin laughed, instantly appearing before Luo Tian and Ding Hongfei.

Leng Qiuchan, however, remained calm. She slowly walked before Luo Tian and the others as if it were natural.

When they had just approached, Ding's daughter and son also opened their eyes, displaying a hint of joy. Especially Ding Yuanshan, who had reached the bone-subjugation peak and was overjoyed.

The spiritual energy in the sky dissipated as they ascended.

"Alright, since you've all awakened, we'll take our leave first!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a smile as he bowed to Ding's daughter and son.

"Luo elder, I can't accompany you this time. The situation in Lishui City truly doesn't allow me to leave. I also need to visit the Smelting City!" Ding Yuanshan's face showed a cold expression, gazing toward the southwest direction—the direction of Smelting City.

"Indeed, this trouble I brought to Lishui City has made me owe you a great favor!" Luo Tian hadn't expected Ding's daughter and son to accompany him on the risky journey to North Chang County.

After exchanging a few words, Luo Tian and Ding Hongfei led Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin toward North Chang County.

"Alas..." Ding Yuanshan gazed at Luo Tian and Ding Hongfei, each carrying one person as they flew into the distance. Long Baobao, seemingly without spiritual energy fluctuations, also followed them away.

Ding Xiaoyan did the same. For some reason, she felt a hint of loss in her heart.

...

In North Chang County, death was common. However, after the formation of a powerful faction named "Wutian" in North Chang County's outer regions, it completely changed the region's balance.

This faction rapidly unified everyone outside Beiming City. They hovered around Beiming City with a calculated presence, like a knife at the neck of Beiming City's family forces.

In response, the numerous families of Beiming City finally united to attack this faction. They even deployed Yuanling Realm masters.

Wu Di, the leader of the Wutian faction, was now renowned in North Chang County. Almost everyone in Beiming City knew that Wu Di was the sole survivor of the family destroyed by them. Yet no one expected this纨绔子弟 to become so powerful, as if it were a miracle.

But now Wu Di's face was pale. Hundreds of his subordinates surrounded him.

Shouts of battle echoed into Wu Di's ears, while his subordinates fell one by one at his feet.

Wu Di's heart felt like it was bleeding. His thousands of forces had now dwindled to just hundreds.

Wu Di's face showed coldness. He gazed at the people high above, his eyes filled with madness. He clutched a blue sword and continuously slashed.

Each slash of Wu Di's sword resulted in someone dying or being wounded. But it was futile. Seeing thousands of Beiming City family disciples surrounding him, Wu Di dared not show despair; he feared that if his subordinates saw even a hint of despair, those remaining would also perish.

"I surrender..." One person could no longer bear it and shouted the word "surrender."

Wu Di's face showed anger. If they surrendered, it would be a massive blow to his group.

"I also surrender..." As one person shouted "surrender," more and more voices of surrender gradually echoed through the crowd.

"Those bastards!" Seeing over a hundred people shouting "surrender," a thin young man by Wu Di's side displayed anger.

"Don't blame them!" Wu Di showed no expression. One hundred people surrendering was within his acceptance range. After all, this was North Chang County!

"Surrender? We never said we would take prisoners. You really have the audacity to attack us from Qi Family and the three major families. Do you think your strength is enough to overturn everything?" The crowd of Beiming City's family members laughed.

The Beiming City family side seemed to ignore the surrender cries, beginning to massacre those who had shouted "surrender."

"Good for them! Traitors deserve death!" The young man by Wu Di's side also displayed a hint of joy.

"Kill..." A cold voice echoed in Wu Di's ears. Blade energy surged, instantly slicing toward the young man.

"Pound..." A thunderous sound echoed. Wu Di's figure appeared before the stunned young man.

"Qi Derong!" Wu Di clenched his trembling hands, softly uttering the name.

Chapter 449: Despair

Chapter 449: Despair

"Unexpectedly, a small waste could stir up such a storm. I underestimated you!" Qi Derong's face showed a smile, his aura radiating bone-subjugation late stage.

Qi Derong's three sons stood behind him, their powerful auras radiating outward.

"Done..." Wu Di sighed inwardly. If he hadn't feared any family before, it was not because of his own strength but due to the number of his forces.

In North Chang County, families ranked among the top ten had at most a thousand people, including the elderly and women. Thus, with his thousands of forces, he could completely surround a family using a human wave tactic.

But now, he faced an attack from almost all forces in Beiming City. The lack of high-level combat power was evident.

Although he knew he wasn't a match for Qi Derong, Wu Di's heart had no fear. Instead, his eyes turned red with fury, recalling how his family was destroyed by Qi Family. Luo Tian's eyes instantly turned blood-red; Wu Di seemed to be overwhelmed by hatred.

A pill fell into Wu Di's hand. It was a short-term strength-increasing pill Luo Tian had given him before. However, its side effects were surprisingly severe—only reaching bone-subjugation peak even for Yuanling Realm masters. After the pill's effects wore off, their strength would drop to bone-subjugation peak.

Wu Di didn't hesitate. He swallowed the pill, knowing he was destined to die today and decided to take the risk.

"Crack..." A continuous sound echoed from Wu Di's body. Cracks formed on his surface, and his strength instantly rose from bone-subjugation late stage to peak.

After taking the pill, Wu Di didn't stop. Three drops of blood floated out and he swallowed them, further increasing his strength. His body seemed to have grown three times in size, as if ready to explode at any moment.

"Roar..." Feeling unprecedented strength, Wu Di's face showed a cruel smile. He swung his sword, sending a blade of energy toward Qi Derong and his three sons.

"Going all out?" Qi Derong smiled, slicing his sword to block Wu Di's blade energy.

But the next moment, Qi Derong's eyes slightly narrowed. His face showed a hint of disdain.

Wu Di's shadow instantly appeared before Qi Derong's three sons, causing their faces to slightly surprise. However, they soon displayed a hint of disdain.

"Thinking we're soft targets?" The second son Qi Tianchu showed mockery, his aura suddenly凝聚.

"Good. No need for father to act!" Qi Tianba spoke in a deep voice, his face showing excitement.

As for Qi Derong's third son Qi Wenhao, his face showed no emotion. However, his eyes carried a coldness.

Their auras surged into the sky, causing Wu Di to pause and display surprise. His face showed shock.

"Two bone-subjugation late stages, one bone-subjugation peak!" Wu Di's face showed shock. He hadn't expected their strength to increase by a level in such a short time.

"Surprised? You, a waste, could reach bone-subjugation late stage. How much more so for us? We are prodigies!" Qi Tianchu showed mockery, snorting.

"Kill..." Wu Di didn't hesitate and rushed forward.

Qi Family's three brothers also roared, drawing their swords and rushing toward Wu Di. The battlefield of four became the most dazzling place, with thunderous sounds echoing around them.

Behind the battlefield, several middle-aged men displayed faint smiles, gazing at the nearly concluded battle. One Yuanling Realm elder stood among them.

"This Wu Di is really bold. After following that kid, he still dared to return!" Han Family's patriarch Han Lihui displayed a faint smile, gazing at the one-sided battlefield.

"Hmph! He's just seeking death. Thinking he could dominate North Chang County with some strength!" A senior displayed disdain, not even bothering to look at Wu Di struggling desperately.

The senior's words made the other family patriarchs display respect. This elder was none other than Qi Family's ancestral master, Qi Feiying, who had just entered the Yuanling Realm.

Yuanling Realm was an absolute power in Beiming City. With Qi Feiying's ascension and Qi Derong and his three sons' formidable strength, the Qi Family had risen from seventh to fourth place in Beiming City. Now it was at its peak, surpassing the three major families.

This siege of Wu Di was led by Qi Feiying himself, to demonstrate the family's strength and establish its prestige.

"Only regret is that Huang Family didn't come!" Zhao Family patriarch Zhao Hongyi frowned slightly, discontent with Huang Family's actions.

"Huang Family!" Qi Feiying's face showed a fierce expression, clearly upset that Huang Family hadn't given him the courtesy. His eyes carried coldness.

However, Qi Feiying knew that even after entering Yuanling Realm, he was still far from being able to challenge Huang Family. Huang Family's strength was beyond his reach.

"Don't worry, Huang Family! It won't exist for long!" Qi Feiying's side, a young man in black clothes displayed mockery. He gazed at the battlefield with excitement in his eyes.

No one noticed that beneath these people's feet, dozens of red-glowing pearls continuously absorbed the blood energy from the fallen.

Hearing the young man's words, Qi Feiying displayed a hint of respect. However, Han Lihui and Zhao Hongyi didn't notice this.

The scent of blood continuously entered their noses. The battlefield gradually reached its end. Wu Di's group had endured another attack, leaving only over a hundred people, all with serious injuries.

Wu Di's face was pale to the extreme. His body was covered in various fierce wounds, with blood continuously flowing out.

"Son of a bitch!" Wu Di's eyes showed madness. His sword had already been knocked away by Qi Family's sons. He could feel they wanted to torment him, leaving no chance of survival.

Feeling the pill's effects were about to wear off and the blood energy's strength was gradually dissipating, Wu Di showed no fear. Only a regret remained.
