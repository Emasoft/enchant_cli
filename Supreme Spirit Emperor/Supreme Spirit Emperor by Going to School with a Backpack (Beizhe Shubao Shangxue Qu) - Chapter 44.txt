“Soul Awareness Power!” Luo Tian murmured, his face filled with shock. To absorb his soul awareness... what terrifying soul awareness power it was.

At the same time, others were entangled by a black dragon of soul awareness. The dragon slithered around them, trapping them on the ground.

Luo Tian fled at maximum speed. But the dragon was even swifter, clinging to his back like a parasite.

At this moment, all others lay helpless on the ground, their faces filled with hope as they watched Luo Tian. They hoped he would escape and break through this predicament.

Though they felt no abnormality now, seeing the five fierce beasts, they knew if they couldn't find a way out, their fate would be no different from the five beasts. Now Luo Tian was their last hope.

“Pang…” A heavy sound echoed as Luo Tian's body crashed onto the ground, dust swirling up.

“Done!” Chen Changsheng and others looked disappointed, sighing inwardly.

As soon as the black dragon wrapped around Luo Tian, he was shocked. The dragon transformed into countless inscriptions on his body, slithering around him.

As the inscriptions moved, Luo Tian felt his already partially restored vital energy flowing slower.

This sensation was familiar—he knew it was the power of a seal. Though much weaker than the Nirvana Dragon Seal from Long Jian and his wife, it easily restrained Luo Tian's strength.

Seeing the last one trapped, the withered old man smiled slightly. His hands, like chopsticks, moved again, and fifteen black vapors emerged from his body, enveloping the fifteen people.

“This is the vital energy your outside people can cultivate? How beautiful! If only my clan wasn't trapped here, we could have cultivated too!” The old man looked intoxicated.

The black vapors clung to Luo Tian, and he felt his vital energy seeking an outlet, flowing out through the black vapors.

Others also noticed this situation, their eyes wide with shock. Now they finally understood the cause of the five beasts' deaths—absorbed by this old man. Not only that, but even the residual vital energy in their blood was not spared.

A wave of fear spread through everyone's hearts. They struggled desperately but were powerless to move.

Luo Tian was also extremely anxious. Though the vital energy flowed slowly, in this sealed cave space without replenishment, restoring it was impossibly difficult. Being drained was just a matter of time.

“Old bastard! Let us go!”
“You only need to promise to release me, and I'll grant all your requests!” They all roared.

But the old man seemed deaf, his face sneering: “Release you? I doubt you'd kill me the moment I let go. My old bones can't withstand your折腾!”

“You have no strength to kill me! You're overestimating us!” Luo Tian's eyes showed bitterness as he asked softly.

Chapter 212: Breaking Through

Chapter 212: Breaking Through

Seeming to sense Luo Tian's vital energy was richer than others, the old man looked at him with a slight change in expression. He spoke softly: “Since you're about to die, I'll tell you—had you attacked me from the start, I might not have withstood even one of your fingers!”

But due to my clan's delay and your carelessness, I absorbed the five beasts' so-called vital energy and soul force, greatly enhancing my strength.

“Though I now have only soul awareness power in this body, it's still fragile,” the old man said with pride, gazing at them.

Hearing this, fifteen faces showed intense regret. They wished they had killed this leader earlier and left him behind.

Luo Tian also felt deep regret. He'd sensed the old man's difference from the start. Even when evading the soul awareness dragon formed by the old man, killing him would have ended this trap. How could he end up here now?

“Regret's no use. Killing you will add one more strength to me, especially you—your vital energy is strong, and your soul awareness is incredibly powerful. Our魂族 specializes in soul awareness; I suppose you're the strongest among your peers,” the old man said, walking up to Luo Tian and patting his head with a dry hand.

“Old dog! Do you know who we are? If you kill us, I guarantee not only will you be wiped out, but all魂族 across the continent will be exterminated! Believe me!” Tu Yu Zheng's heart felt cold, but he remained calm and threatened.

Luo Tian nodded inwardly. Tu Yu Zheng was truly the eldest brother, experienced beyond measure. Even in this situation, he could still threaten their opponent and use his identity to intimidate.

“Indeed, we are all prodigies of major sects. If you're wise, release us immediately. We can agree to your conditions. Otherwise, even if you die, your sect's elders will drag you back from reincarnation and let you suffer endlessly!” Others, hearing Tu Yu Zheng's words, brightened their eyes and threatened again.

“I've already lived long enough!” The old man spoke, gazing at the ceiling of the second level of Suoling Tower. His eyes held a strange expression.

“But I still have some unfinished matters. Once done, I won't live long. Having these prodigies as my company makes me worthwhile!” The old man spoke calmly.

“Since you've lived enough, then die!” Luo Tian's voice was cold.

Luo Tian's eyes flashed with cold light, like lightning striking the old man's gaze. But the old man only blinked and laughed.

“Young man, you're indeed strong, but breaking through my seal formed by the peak of soul awareness and our魂族 secret techniques is like a fool's dream!” The old man said confidently.

“A fool's dream? I think you're so trapped here that your mind is muddled. Don't you know the saying 'there are always people higher than you, and skies beyond skies'?” Luo Tian's eyes showed a slight smile, staring at the old man.

“Hmph! Sharp-tongued brat. I was considering taking you first. Since you're so eager, then start with you!” The old man sneered and slightly pressed his hands together, accelerating the absorption of Luo Tian's vital energy.

“You won't have that chance!” Luo Tian shrugged his shoulders, emitting a powerful aura from his body.

“Pang…” A sound of something breaking echoed from him. The black inscription dragon wrapped around his body shattered, dispersing into dark mist.

As this sound echoed, a chain reaction followed. A series of thunderous sounds rang out from Luo Tian's body. One by one, the inscription-formed shackles were broken, dispersing into swirling black mist.

“You!” The old man's eyes widened in shock, exclaiming before he couldn't speak. His withered face showed a flush of red.

The old man felt a giant hand like a clamp around his neck, suffocating him. His withered body struggled desperately, his throat gurgling.

“Sorry, I'm also at the peak of soul awareness!” Luo Tian's cold voice thundered, shaking the old man's mind.

“Luo Tian!” Others' faces showed great joy. They had just been thinking about how to escape, then saw Luo Tian break free from the black dragon trapping them and catch the old man.

Leng Qiuchan looked at Luo Tian, her heart slightly happy. Though she also had a way to break free from the black inscription shackles, it would cost much. This made her hesitate slightly.

“Goodbye, old man!”

Luo Tian's fingers pressed slightly. The old man's throat was instantly crushed by Luo Tian, becoming a corpse. His eyes gazed at the ceiling of the second level, his murky eyes showing hope and relief.

He exhaled lightly, gazing at those still trapped by black inscriptions. His face didn't show relief.

Looking at the old man's eyes, Luo Tian felt something strange. But he couldn't determine what was odd. He only noticed the old man's body had no vital energy fluctuations. Otherwise, he wouldn't have killed him with just a slight press.

After all, when one has vital energy, it constantly refines their body, making it stronger. The old man had clearly absorbed much vital energy, yet his body was still fragile. Where had his vital energy gone? Deep doubts arose in Luo Tian's heart.

“Luo Tian, quickly free us!” Chen Changsheng's voice echoed. Though their vital energy no longer flowed out with the old man's death, the black inscriptions still trapped them, making it very uncomfortable.

Hearing Chen Changsheng's voice, Luo Tian stopped thinking about the old man's vital energy. His soul awareness formed a large hand, grabbing the black inscriptions on Chen Changsheng's body and pulling hard.

“Pang…” A series of sounds echoed again. Chen Changsheng's body also had black mist dispersing into the air.

Feeling relieved, Chen Changsheng looked grateful. He was about to speak but was interrupted by Luo Tian: “First save the others!”

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Chen Changsheng收回 his thanks and smiled. From this moment on, he fully regarded Luo Tian as a friend.

Luo Tian's soul awareness hand extended again, breaking the black inscriptions on Chai Xiangming, Jing Bolan, and Feng Tianxiong.

Chapter 213: Transaction

Chapter 213: Transaction

Feeling a sense of relief, Jing Bolan and the others looked at Luo Tian with a slight smile. They had constantly mocked Luo Tian since leaving Yongyang Town, even wanting to drive him out of their group. But since entering Suoling Tower, Luo Tian's performance had been astonishing, even saving them multiple times.

This made the three proud individuals feel embarrassed and also admire Chen Changsheng's sharp eyesight.

Ignoring their grateful looks, Luo Tian turned to those still trapped. A playful expression appeared on his face, especially when he saw Leng Qiuchan's figure outlined by the black inscriptions. He took a few more glances.

Feeling Luo Tian's gaze, Leng Qiuchan's face under her black veil turned slightly red. Her eyes were cold as she glanced at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian awkwardly rubbed his nose and turned to Chen Changsheng and Chai Xiangming, smiling: “How should we handle the remaining people?”

“Whatever. Let them stay here. Once we take the inheritance, we'll release them!” Chai Xiangming looked at them with a hint of satisfaction.

Previously, these people had ignored them. Now they needed Luo Tian's help to escape. This was clearly a face-slapping moment.

Feng Tianxiong and Jing Bolan also showed a hint of satisfaction, but their eyes held admiration for Luo Tian. Their current freedom and situation were entirely due to Luo Tian's strength.

“This is left to me. I believe with the魂族 destroyed, there won't be much trouble in Suoling Tower. You go and take the inheritance first!” Luo Tian smiled faintly, speaking to Chen Changsheng and others.

“Good!” Chen Changsheng nodded. Luo Tian's words now carried great weight. After all, they had no use remaining here. Whether to save or not depended on Luo Tian's mood.

After Chen Changsheng spoke, he and the three headed toward the third level.

Seeing Chen Changsheng and the others heading to the third level, Tu Yu Zheng and Pang Haoran finally showed anxious expressions. If they had acted earlier, it was likely they would have returned empty-handed. Especially for them, if Chen Changsheng had found the Zhen Tian Jian first, they would be completely overshadowed by him from now on.

“Luo Tian! What do you want to make us go through!” Pang Haoran couldn't bear it and asked softly.

Others also looked at Luo Tian with anxious expressions. Only Leng Qiuchan and her three black-cloaked companions sat there, watching Luo Tian. For her, the inheritance of Suoling Tower was irrelevant; if obtained, it was good, otherwise no big deal. However, these three black-cloaked people looked at Luo Tian with cold killing intent. They had clearly seen Luo Tian's gaze toward Leng Qiuchan.

“Everyone, I suppose you all have some life-saving items. If you use them, the black soul awareness shackles won't last even a breath before breaking!” Luo Tian spoke softly.

Luo Tian believed these people, as sect prodigies, would have life-saving items prepared by their sects. Even Lu Kunpeng had given him many pills when he left. How could they not have?

“There are, but the cost is too high!” Leng Qiuchan spoke softly, her voice cold.

Luo Tian slightly frowned. This was clearly an explanation for him. He wouldn't be a fool if he didn't understand.

“So what? I also have a big cost!” Luo Tian feigned exhaustion, patting his forehead.

“Damn it! Can you be more fake? Just say your conditions! If they're within our limits, we'll agree!” Pang Haoran couldn't bear Luo Tian's feigned behavior and impatiently spoke.

“Alas, Pang Xiong, we're all from the Northern Region. I can't ask for too much!” Luo Tian said.

“Don't be so slow! Just say it quickly! If you don't, we'll make you suffer!” Tu Yu Zheng behind Pang Haoran spoke coldly.

“Hmph! You're really a pain!” Luo Tian walked up to Tu Yu Zheng and slapped his shoulder hard.

“Puk…” Tu Yu Zheng, who was not only trapped but also had his vital energy sealed, couldn't withstand Luo Tian's slap. He spat out blood, his face pale and eyes fierce.

“Pills! Pills that restore vital energy!” Luo Tian's eyes showed mockery, scanning the group.

“Dream on!” Pang Haoran shouted loudly. Others also looked doubtful.

Pills that restore vital energy were precious in this sealed cave space. They had previously killed without hesitation in the second level because they carried many pills. If they hadn't, they might have died under people's attacks.

“Alright! Since everyone disagrees, I can't do anything. After all, I've used too much vital energy to free my companions. Sorry, I can't help!” Luo Tian feigned a sigh, smiling and heading toward the third level's stairs.

“Hmph!” Pang Haoran and Tu Yu Zheng coldly snorted, watching Luo Tian's slow movement. They were sure Luo Tian would turn back, thinking this was a great opportunity to blackmail them. But they soon became disappointed; under their gaze, Luo Tian had already reached the third level's steps.

“Wait!” Tu Yu Zheng and Pang Haoran both spoke at once, stopping Luo Tian's movement. His lips slightly curled.

“How much?” Pang Haoran asked with a dark face.

“This depends on my recovery!” Luo Tian turned around, smiling again at the group.

Seeing Luo Tian's smile, they felt hatred. They wished to stomp his face into the ground and spit on it.

Leng Qiuchan, seeing Luo Tian's smile, thought of the three days after adopting a wolf. Luo Tian had threatened her countless times with the wolf's habit of eating pills. She herself had forgotten how many promissory notes she'd written, knowing these people were doomed to be stripped bare by Luo Tian.

“Let's see… why don't you all take out your storage bags so I can check what's inside?” Luo Tian's gaze swept over their waists.

Chapter 214: Third Level of Suoling Tower

Chapter 214: Third Level of Suoling Tower

“Thief! You won't die from overeating!”
“This guy is really people!” Curses echoed from the second level of Suoling Tower.

Pang Haoran and Tu Yu Zheng looked at Luo Tian, who ate pills like candy, with expressions of disbelief.

After Luo Tian's persistent requests, Pang Haoran and others finally opened their storage bags. Each gave half of their pills to restore vital energy to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian didn't hesitate, swallowing their pills immediately. However, after eating them, he realized these pills were truly terrible, not as good as his own made pills. Not to mention comparing them with the pills Lu Kunpeng had given him.

If Lu Kunpeng knew Luo Tian's thoughts, he would certainly curse: “Do you think my pills are cabbage? They're valuable pills from the Northern Region. How dare you compare these trash with mine?”

Luo Tian's vital energy was雄厚, and after previous consumption, half of his liquid vital energy had been drained. It was just right for these prodigies to supplement him.

“Cough…” Luo Tian sighed deeply. Though he ate a lot, there was still about half left. He waved his hand and collected the remaining pills into the storage bag, showing no courtesy.

“Ah, thank you all for your generosity. I'm from a small sect and didn't expect so many pills!” Luo Tian smiled awkwardly, speaking.

Seeing Luo Tian finish eating the pills, Pang Haoran and Tu Yu Zheng suppressed their urge to vomit. They anxiously shouted: “Can you let us go now!”

“I can only delay this far!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, scanning the third level.

He nodded slightly and extended his soul awareness. It凝聚 into a powerful strike against Tu Yu Zheng's soul-awareness inscriptions.

Black mist filled the space. Tu Yu Zheng felt his body lighter, his face dark as he looked at Luo Tian, his battle spirit rising. But it soon calmed down. He sat cross-legged and took pills to recover.

“Pang… Pang… Pang…” Continuous sounds echoed, filling the second level with black mist and obscuring people's vision.

While everyone was recovering cross-legged, Luo Tian placed some pills in front of Leng Qiuchan. She seemed to sense it, her heart warmed slightly. Her lips under the veil curved up slightly as she took the pills.

After finishing this, Luo Tian also sat cross-legged to recover his soul awareness.

An hour passed. Everyone opened their eyes, their gazes sharp with a glint of light. Their eyes were not kind toward Luo Tian.

Feeling something, Luo Tian opened his eyes and looked around at the hostile gazes. His lips curled slightly: “Congratulations, everyone has recovered!”

“Luo Tian! Are your pills so tasty!” Pang Haoran spoke coldly, his eyes filled with killing intent toward Luo Tian.

Behind Pang Haoran, Ying Hongtu and Gu Zhengye took out their weapons, looking at Luo Tian with ill intent.

Tu Yu Zheng held a whisk, emitting strong fluctuations. The three black-cloaked people standing with Leng Qiuchan also radiated killing intent.

Seeing the hostile gazes, Luo Tian remained calm. His Cracking Heaven Spear was in his hand, a hint of disdain on his face: “I didn't expect you to turn against me so quickly!”

“Pang…” The Cracking Heaven Spear stood upright, smiling. Its aura suddenly condensed without fear.

Tu Yu Zheng and Pang Haoran's faces were dark, almost dripping water. This was their first time losing to peers, making it hard for them to accept. Even Chen Changsheng had only slightly disadvantaged them.

“Don't you still linger here? If you're late, the Zhen Tian Jian might have been found by them!” Leng Qiuchan spoke coldly, pulling everyone's thoughts back.

Tu Yu Zheng and Pang Haoran shook. Remembering they couldn't waste time, they suppressed their anger and said: “Go!”

“Luo Tian! We'll have a fight someday to repay the humiliation at Dahan Forest!”
“No matter if you're a prodigy of the Five Elements Sect or not, you'll pay for what you've done today!” Ying Hongtu and Tuo Baye spoke one after another, their eyes cold as they followed Tu Yu Zheng and Pang Haoran.

“Remember, your life is mine!” Leng Qiuchan's cold voice echoed, followed by the three black-cloaked people as they chased after Tu Yu Zheng.

Seeing everyone's disappearing figures, Luo Tian rubbed his nose and didn't take down the Cracking Heaven Spear. He carried it on his shoulder, walking confidently into the third level of Suoling Tower.

As Luo Tian's feet stepped onto the third level, he felt dizzy again.

This dizziness was familiar. It was the power of teleportation. Luo Tian couldn't help but curse: “Again! Always moving people around, have you considered my feelings!”

Luo Tian was truly fed up. He didn't understand why these masters loved to teleport people. Long Jian did it, and this Suoling Tower did too!

Luo Tian's body emitted a dull sound as he fell to the ground. Sitting down, his soul awareness instinctively extended outward, discovering this place was vast and lifeless.

He stood up, stretched his body. He didn't know what to do. He dared not walk far, after all, who knew what was in the third level.

“Defeat me to enter the fourth level of Suoling Tower!” A cold, numb voice echoed.

In front of him stood a middle-aged man with an expressionless face.

Luo Tian was shocked. He wasn't surprised by his soul awareness not detecting this person, but he felt no life at all on him.

“Who are you!” Luo Tian asked softly.

“Defeat me to enter the fourth level of Suoling Tower!” The middle-aged man didn't answer Luo Tian's question. His cold voice echoed again.

Luo Tian scanned the mysterious space around him, finding no other person's presence. He felt relieved, knowing this middle-aged man wasn't controlled by someone. Upon closer inspection, the man's face wasn't a flesh one but made of unknown metal.

“Puppet!” Luo Tian guessed this third level was a puppet created for those entering Suoling Tower to test their strength.

“Defeat me to enter the fourth level of Suoling Tower! One last warning, attack!” The puppet middle-aged man's voice just finished, his body shot forward like an arrow toward Luo Tian. His green fist smashed toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian felt the puppet's attack strength, a slight smile on his face: “About body refinement level eight? You want to block me?”

Chapter 215: Selling Pills

Chapter 215: Selling Pills

“Pang…” Luo Tian casually dodged the puppet's attack and punched, his body's bone-destroying power with terrifying might smashing into the middle-aged man.

The puppet's body emitted a metallic sound, flying backward with a dull thud.

But this puppet seemed unaware of pain. It got up from the ground again, attacking Luo Tian once more.

“Trouble!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly. This puppet was good in that it didn't feel pain. If it were a normal body refinement level eight, he would have already beaten him into serious injury.

As time passed, the space echoed with continuous thunderous sounds. Luo Tian decided not to use his vital energy, using this indestructible puppet to gain practical combat experience.

“Pang…” As three hours passed, Luo Tian was drenched in sweat, breathing heavily. He looked at the puppet middle-aged man who had no ability to resist and smashed his fist into its chest.

This punch didn't use vital energy but could match a body refinement level nine strike. The puppet's chest caved in with a metallic crack, flying backward and falling to the ground.

“Passed!” The puppet's voice echoed without Luo Tian reacting.

At the moment the puppet spoke, a wave of teleportation power struck Luo Tian again.

Luo Tian was still catching his breath. He felt a cold breeze, a chill air locking onto him. A blade pressed against his neck.

“Failure!” Luo Tian was still confused when he was teleported out again.

“Damn it! What is this!” Luo Tian's stomach churned, his eyes dizzy. He cursed loudly.

After adapting, Luo Tian found himself in the second level of Suoling Tower.

He looked around and saw no one. He decided to examine the second level.

At this moment, the second level was filled with nearly a thousand corpses. The only place to stand was a small area. Luo Tian walked over to the seat of the魂族 old man, observing the black seat with interest.

Luo Tian tried to pull the chair but found it couldn't be moved. He knew this seat was clearly embedded in the ground of the second level of Suoling Tower, not placed there by the魂族 later.

He tried again with more force. Luo Tian's expression turned serious. He knew how strong his current strength was. Yet, he couldn't move even a chair.

“Pang…” A dull sound echoed as Chai Xiangming's body fell onto the second level.

“Luo Tian?” Seeing Luo Tian pulling the chair, Chai Xiangming called out and walked up to him.

“Why did you come out?”

“I didn't go in!”

Luo Tian and Chai Xiangming spoke at the same time.

“I went in, but after defeating a puppet, I was immediately teleported out!” Luo Tian's face showed helplessness.

“I did too. This is my second time entering. I came out once, found no one in the second level, and went up again. Your situation is similar. I spent a long time defeating the puppet before being teleported to the fourth level, where I met a mountain-sized monster that knocked me out!” Chai Xiangming's face showed helplessness.

“Can I enter again?” Luo Tian's face showed understanding as he asked.

“Of course. Others have all entered, otherwise they wouldn't have lasted so long!” Chai Xiangming spoke.

“Ah, then go in first! I'll rest a bit before entering.” Luo Tian said.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Chai Xiangming's face showed a bitter smile. But then he looked at Luo Tian: “Luo Tian, do you have any pills to restore vital energy? Lend me some. I'll return them when I go out, or give you spirit stones and treasures. I've used up my pills after entering twice!”

Hearing Chai Xiangming's words, Luo Tian was slightly surprised. He handed a jade bottle to Chai Xiangming.

Chai Xiangming's face showed great joy. In this sealed cave space, these pills to restore vital energy were precious. Even if Luo Tian didn't give them to him, he wouldn't say anything. Especially since his attitude toward Luo Tian had been so harsh before. If he were in Luo Tian's position, he wouldn't have acted like Luo Tian.

He extended his hand and a yellow-grade初级 blade appeared. He handed the blade to Luo Tian, sighing: “Luo Tian, I was wrong before. This blade is a reward from my sect after completing one mission. Though it's not valuable, it's my small gesture. If you accept it, take it!”

Luo Tian hesitated but Chai Xiangming insisted. He smiled and accepted it.

Looking at Chai Xiangming sitting cross-legged to recover, Luo Tian's eyes showed thoughts. He looked at the stairs of the third level and smiled. This smile was familiar, just like the one he had used to extort Tu Yu Zheng.

“Huh…” Chai Xiangming sighed, looking at Luo Tian who was smiling. He asked: “Luo Tian, what's wrong with you?”

“Uh! Nothing!” Luo Tian quickly waved his hands, saying there was no problem.

“I'll go up then! This time I must pass the fourth level!” Chai Xiangming's face showed determination. He bowed to Luo Tian and walked toward the third-level stairs.

Seeing Chai Xiangming go up, Luo Tian's face showed a smile again. A white cloth appeared in his hand. The Cracking Heaven Spear pierced through the cloth, and a brush appeared in his hand. He waved his hand.

“Selling Pills!” The four characters were printed on the white cloth. Since Luo Tian hadn't read much since childhood, these words were written terribly, barely recognizable as "Selling Pills."

“Wum…”, the Cracking Heaven Spear emitted a buzzing sound, seemingly dissatisfied with being used as a pole.

“Ah! Once I make money, I'll buy some rare metals for you to absorb!” Luo Tian sat by the black gold seat, speaking softly to the spear.

Hearing Luo Tian's promise, the spear seemed to understand and stood still.

“Wum…” As Luo Tian's words finished, a wave of fluctuation spread through the space.

“Pang…” A dull sound echoed. A white figure fell to the ground with a thud, landing right in the pile of black-cloaked corpses.

Chapter 216: No Business

Chapter 216: No Business

“Zhuang Shengjie?” Luo Tian looked at the white-clothed figure falling, murmuring.

He knew little about Zhuang Shengjie, only knowing her name. When he had released everyone's soul awareness inscriptions, she had shown no other expression.

Zhuang Shengjie looked confused, gazing around. When she saw the corpses everywhere, her face darkened. She felt her body was sticky with blood, making her expression even worse.

She jumped up, her body bouncing high. She saw Luo Tian's open space and immediately rushed to his side, startling Luo Tian who was deep in thought.

Zhuang Shengjie immediately released a thick water-element vital energy from her hand. Water surged with strong impact, pushing her to the ground.

Luo Tian was stunned. He thought: “This person is crazy!”

After her clothes were clean, Zhuang Shengjie sighed in satisfaction. She used the remaining vital energy to dry her clothes.

After finishing this, Zhuang Shengjie noticed Luo Tian staring at her. Seeing the醒目 white cloth and the messy characters, she frowned slightly and sneered, standing there with a pill in her hand. She put it in her mouth to recover.

Seeing Zhuang Shengjie not speaking, Luo Tian didn't bother to initiate conversation. He sat leisurely, admiring the characters on the white cloth. The more he looked, the more satisfied he was. He thought inwardly: If I had taken the imperial examination and become a scholar, maybe I could have succeeded.

“Wum…” The fluctuation of vital energy echoed again. Luo Tian's spirit slightly trembled, expecting to look at the fluctuation spot. When he saw the falling figure, his face showed disappointment again.

Chen Changsheng appeared in Luo Tian's vision with a bitter smile.

As Chen Changsheng landed, he saw the醒目 white cloth and messy characters. His lips twitched slightly as he said: “Luo Tian!”

Luo Tian greeted him without much enthusiasm. He roughly understood Chen Changsheng's situation, similar to his and Chai Xiangming’s. He was teleported to an unknown level and fell down. Since he entered first, his speed should be faster than others. His pills were also running low.

Luo Tian handed Chen Changsheng some pills, and after a brief hesitation, he reluctantly accepted a yellow-grade high-level weapon.

Chen Changsheng and Zhuang Shengjie both closed their eyes to recover vital energy. Soon, they opened their eyes simultaneously and marched toward the third-level stairs.

Luo Tian felt a bit regretful watching them enter the third level. His eyes again eagerly anticipated someone to come out.

“Wum…” The familiar fluctuation echoed again. This time, Luo Tian's spirit had already probed it. It was another disappointment, as everyone still had some pills to restore vital energy.

After several rounds, Luo Tian only gave some pills to Feng Tianxiong and Jing Bolan. They, out of gratitude and guilt, insisted on giving Luo Tian a yellow-grade weapon. Only after he accepted did they stop.

As for others, they all sneered and looked at Luo Tian like a madman. They took out their pills to recover vital energy.
