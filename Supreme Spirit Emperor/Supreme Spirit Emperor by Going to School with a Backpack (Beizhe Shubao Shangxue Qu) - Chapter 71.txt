For a moment, time slipped by unnoticed. At the high platform of the Bone-Devouring Realm, a dense crowd had gathered—exactly one hundred people, packed so tightly that no more could fit.

The remaining over a thousand stood idly by, their faces cold with resentment.

Luo Tian let out a quiet sigh in his heart. His speed had lagged by half a beat; if he could have secured one of the hundred spots, it would have been far easier.

“Boom…” Someone finally could not hold back and launched an attack on the people atop the platform. Martial arts techniques erupted, striking toward those standing there.

Yet no one dared to attack Zheng Xin, Duan Xingchen, or Leng Qiuchan. A vacuum of space surrounded them.

After all, they were the children of the sect masters of the three major sects. Though the rules claimed that combat was allowed within, everyone knew it was just talk. If anything happened to Leng Qiuchan and the others, no one doubted that the sect masters would not sit idly by.

The scene became extremely chaotic. Some who believed in their own strength began vying for the platform’s spots, while others turned their eyes toward those around them.

Even though Luo Tian stood at the very edge of the crowd, he was still noticed by many.

“Fool! With only Body Refinement Ninth Stage, how dare you come to the Bone-Devouring Realm? You truly don’t value your life!” A young man of the Bone-Devouring Initial Stage sneered at Luo Tian.

“Is he here?” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, his gaze cold as he looked at the young man.

Luo Tian knew that in others’ eyes, he was a tempting target—truly someone who would be trampled upon. What he needed now was to instill fear, not just among the Bone-Devouring Midstage masters but even those of the Initial Stage. Otherwise, everyone would come to challenge him one after another.

“This kid… isn’t he the one who once clashed with Duan Xingchen? How bold of him to dare come here and seek death!” People sighed, their eyes filled with the look of pitying a soft plum.

Some people secretly regretted that they had let this youth take the initiative, missing out on the jade token.

As people sighed, the young man of Bone-Devouring Initial Stage revealed a sinister expression. His body flickered, and he launched a punch toward Luo Tian’s front.

“Suppression!” To avoid revealing his identity, Luo Tian could only unleash the pressure of Bone-Devouring Peak to deter him for a while.

“Hmph…” The young man abruptly halted, his face filled with disbelief as he felt Luo Tian’s aura. It was a pure Bone-Devouring Peak aura.

“Good!” Luo Tian’s golden light flickered beneath his feet, and he instantly appeared before the young man. His fists, infused with Body Refinement Midstage strength and Qi, struck directly into the young man’s chest.

“Boom…” A dull sound echoed as the young man, still stunned, looked at Luo Tian with disbelief before being sent flying backward, blood trickling from his lips.

“Want to kill me? Then go die!” Luo Tian, with a casual motion, retrieved a dagger from his storage ring and rushed toward the young man. His face was twisted with menace as he slashed at the youth’s neck.

Chapter 348: The Reappearance of the Heart-Seeking Dagger

Chapter 348: The Reappearance of the Heart-Seeking Dagger

“Who is this man? How could he, with only Body Refinement Ninth Stage, withstand a Bone-Devouring Initial Stage? I’ve never heard of him before!” People marveled at Luo Tian, who now stood again before the Bone-Devouring Initial Stage youth.

“Pf!” The young man had never expected that the so-called soft plum, Luo Tian, would be so fierce. A glint of light flashed as the young man narrowly dodged the vital spot, but his arm was still slashed by the dagger.

“Hum…” A faint consciousness resonated from the dagger in Luo Tian’s hand, transmitting into his mind.

“Hm?” Luo Tian felt puzzled and examined the dagger closely, a look of confusion on his face.

This was merely an ordinary high-grade dagger he had grabbed from his storage ring, yet it had generated this faint consciousness after slicing the young man’s arm.

“Heart-Seeking!” Luo Tian suddenly remembered. This dagger had belonged to Gao Jie of the Yin Sect, who he had killed before. At that time, he felt something strange about it but never took the time to investigate. He had no idea that today, by chance, he would have grabbed it.

Holding the Heart-Seeking Dagger in his hand, a yearning for blood surged into Luo Tian’s mind like an infant who hadn’t eaten in days.

“Since you like blood, today I’ll let you feast until full. Let’s see what happens after you absorb the blood!” Luo Tian’s face twisted with cruelty as he glared at the young man who had attacked him, then rushed toward him again.

Luo Tian knew his martial arts techniques were limited, so he could not allow anyone to have a chance to use their skills against him. Otherwise, it would definitely be himself who suffered the loss.

“I’ll kill you!” The young man’s face darkened, his feelings of resentment deepening as he saw the contemptuous glances from others. He felt ashamed for being injured and was determined to avenge himself.

He gripped a ruler-like weapon in his hand, gritting his teeth as he slammed it toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with a smile. Since the opponent was not using any martial arts, it was within his range of control. Golden light flared as golden Qi gathered into his fists and met the ruler’s strike head-on.

“Boom…” A dull sound echoed as Luo Tian’s body slightly staggered. The gold-element Qi returned to his feet, and he became a streak of golden light, appearing behind the young man.

“Ss…” The dagger slashed across the young man’s back, carving a deep gash.

“Hum…” As blood landed on the Heart-Seeking Dagger, it was instantly absorbed, and the dagger emitted a joyous hum.

The young man was nearly疯 (crazy), his earth-element body type being naturally suppressed by the gold-element. His greatest strength was speed, and this made him even more furious.

“Hm?” Luo Tian felt a slight surprise. He could sense that the Heart-Seeking Dagger had forcibly absorbed a bit of the young man’s essence blood in the moment it sliced his back. Though not much, if this continued, the young man would definitely be drained to death.

Moreover, Luo Tian felt that the Heart-Seeking Dagger was evolving, becoming stronger than before. It seemed to be approaching the level of an elite-tier weapon.

Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed as he looked at this Bone-Devouring Stage youth, licking his lips and darting into a whirlwind to attack the young man again.

“Pf…” Another wound formed on the youth’s body.

Luo Tian continued to circle around the young man, and the Heart-Seeking Dagger kept inflicting damage. Though the wounds were not large enough to kill a Bone-Devouring Stage master, each contact took away a bit of the young man’s essence blood.

At first, the youth was furious and could not touch Luo Tian, forced to defend passively. But as time passed, he gradually relaxed, thinking that Luo Tian’s attacks would not harm him, who was skilled in defense.

Time passed slowly. The surrounding people gradually felt bored and stopped watching Luo Tian’s fight. Some turned their attention to the battle on the platform, as that was where the real excitement lay. Others started attacking those around them. In an instant, the space exploded with thunderous sounds of martial arts techniques, dazzling and overwhelming.

“Kid, your attacks will eventually exhaust you. Be sensible and surrender. I don’t want to take your life; otherwise, when your Qi runs out, you’ll die very painfully!” The young man seemed to lose patience and wanted to end the fight. After all, it wouldn’t take long for a Body Refinement Ninth Stage person to run out of Qi.

“Is that so?” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly as he slashed the young man’s arm with the Heart-Seeking Dagger, drawing a drop of essence blood into it.

“One drop… he should have noticed by now!” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly, thinking to himself.

“Hm?” As the Heart-Seeking Dagger retracted, the young man suddenly turned pale. His face was filled with shock as he stared at Luo Tian.

One drop of essence blood, for a Bone-Devouring Initial Stage person, was already quite damaging. He had not noticed it before, but now he suddenly realized and looked at Luo Tian with a grim face. He finally understood the terrifying nature of this dagger.

“Hum…” As this drop of Bone-Devouring Initial Stage essence blood was absorbed, the Heart-Seeking Dagger flashed with red light. A strange aura emanated from it.

“Has it advanced?” Luo Tian’s face lit up with joy. He had never imagined there was such a strange weapon in the world—absorbing others’ essence blood to upgrade itself.

Externally, the sect masters watched Luo Tian’s Heart-Seeking Dagger with expressions of change. They had never seen a weapon that could upgrade before.

“This kid definitely has an evil aura. How did he end up with such a strange weapon? One that absorbs others’ essence blood to upgrade. If it falls into the hands of someone with ill intentions, it will surely bring disaster!” Zheng Hongsheng stared at the red-glowing Heart-Seeking Dagger in the screen, speaking softly.

“But this kid seems decent enough. His strength is quite formidable. With his current level, it shouldn’t be hard for him to upgrade this dagger to the earth-tier. However, it’s only just advanced to the elite tier now. I suppose he isn’t a bloodthirsty person!” Leng Hongcai of the Yuling Sect spoke.

“What if this dagger absorbs enough essence blood, could it upgrade to the heavenly tier?” The head of Tianjian Sect looked at the Heart-Seeking Dagger with a mysterious expression.

“Hiss…” Upon hearing the head of Tianjian Sect’s words, everyone’s faces showed shock. Then they all pondered deeply, as if considering the head of Tianjian Sect’s words. However, most people had greedy expressions on their faces.

Chapter 349: The Heretical Cultivator Yu Chengyang

Chapter 349: The Heretical Cultivator Yu Chengyang

“This kid is truly a talent. However, we still need to observe further,” Zheng Hongsheng smiled slightly as he watched Luo Tian running.

“Hiss…” Upon hearing Zheng Hongsheng’s words, the people present showed shock. They had never expected that the head of Jifeng Valley would have such a high opinion of this young man.

But more people focused their eyes on Luo Tian’s Heart-Seeking Dagger, as if considering whether this unassuming dagger could truly upgrade to the heavenly tier.

Luo Tian had no idea that his actions had caught the attention of people outside and even earned a high evaluation from Zheng Hongsheng, the head of Jifeng Valley.

But he had no idea that this Heart-Seeking Dagger, which he had grabbed casually, had also sparked the interest of some scheming sect masters.

“Eight drops…” Luo Tian sighed lightly, appearing in the young man’s line of sight with a happy expression.

The Heart-Seeking Dagger, now at the elite-tier initial stage, absorbed essence blood at a rate more than double that of its previous high-grade level. Not only that, but it also returned the essence blood’s Qi back to Luo Tian’s body.

In contrast, the Bone-Devouring Initial Stage young man had lost eight drops of essence blood. His face was withered, resembling a corpse, his eyes lifeless as he stared at Luo Tian. His movements were increasingly sluggish.

But Luo Tian saw endless hatred in those lifeless eyes.

“Want to kill me? Unfortunately, it’s about time. I should finish you off!” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly.

With lightning speed, he kicked the young man into the air and stomped him to the ground. The Heart-Seeking Dagger flashed with cold light, piercing into the young man’s heart.

“Ah…” A scream echoed from the young man’s mouth.

“Hiss…” The Heart-Seeking Dagger, like a joyous child, absorbed the few remaining drops of essence blood from the young man’s body, declaring his death.

The young man’s appearance was like a corpse, lying there motionless.

“Are you a heretical cultivator?” Someone finally asked, their face filled with confusion as they looked at Luo Tian.

The young man’s death was indeed tragic, drained of his essence blood and dying in agony.

But no one felt sympathy for the Bone-Devouring young man; instead, their gazes toward Luo Tian carried a hint of fear.

Heretical cultivators were an unusual presence on the Tianyuan Continent, and many people disliked them. Some heretical cultivators used extremely cruel methods of cultivation, like the Tianshi Sect, which had taken heretical practices to their extreme—massacring cities and sects, earning the wrath of heaven and people.

Therefore, most people avoided heretical cultivators. The Tianshi Sect was an exception, as it was a taboo on the Tianyuan Continent. Thus, if anyone discovered the Tianshi Sect, all sects would unite to exterminate them—this had been an iron law since ancient times.

At that moment, over a dozen Bone-Devouring Initial Stage masters around Luo Tian looked at him cautiously. Although Luo Tian’s cultivation was only Body Refinement Ninth Stage, the intense fear in those dozen masters’ eyes was clear.

Standing atop the platform and watching Luo Tian, Zheng Xin furrowed his brows slightly. He knew Luo Tian was definitely not a heretical cultivator, as heretical cultivators always carried that bloodstained aura. If Luo Tian were one, Zheng Xin would not have spoken to him in the first place.

Leng Qiuchan saw Luo Tian’s severed hand and realized that this person named Luo Lei was not Luo Tian. Luo Tian’s methods were far more than just a few tricks, and he had always used a spear.

“Heretical cultivator? I suppose I’ll have to kill you then, at least as a form of justice!” Duan Xingchen’s lips curled slightly. His gaze swept over Luo Tian, looking at him like an ant. In his mind, a Body Refinement Ninth Stage person killing a Bone-Devouring Initial Stage master was nothing special. He himself could have done it too!

“But a heretical cultivator of Body Refinement Ninth Stage dares to be so arrogant in front of me?” A young man with a bloodstained aura stepped out from the crowd, his body radiating an overwhelming blood Qi.

“Who is he?”

“Yu Chengyang, the heretical cultivator! I never expected him to come here for this joint recruitment. Rumors say he is also a heretical cultivator. Though his cultivation seems to be Bone-Devouring Initial Stage, he shows no fear even against a Bone-Devouring Midstage master. His strength is enough to stand on the platform. Why is he at the bottom of the platform?!” People marveled and questioned, watching Yu Chengyang with a bloodstained aura.

“Kid, give me three drops of essence blood and hand over the jade token. Considering we are both heretical cultivators, I’ll let you go today. If I have to take it myself, it won’t just be three drops of essence blood!” Yu Chengyang’s face twisted with menace as he threatened Luo Tian.

“Being mistaken for a heretical cultivator? Well, it’s better than more trouble. But if I deal with this Yu Chengyang, no one will dare to attack me!” Luo Tian’s eyes were calm as he thought.

“Three breaths, or I’ll have to take it myself!” Yu Chengyang’s cold voice came from his bloodstained lips.

“Though it’s a bit troublesome, since I’ve come this far, I’ll take the risk. At least I can expose some of my techniques. Hopefully, the one who escaped hasn’t been watching outside!” Luo Tian sighed lightly, his eyes flashing with cold determination as he watched Yu Chengyang counting.

A pill fell into Luo Tian’s hand. Although the fight with the Bone-Devouring Initial Stage young man had allowed the Heart-Seeking Dagger to return some Qi, he still felt a bit drained. This Yu Chengyang was clearly no pushover; he needed to maintain his best condition for a chance of victory.

A thick essence of herbs spread throughout the space, slightly diluting the intense bloodstained aroma.

“This kid actually has a good pill. What’s his identity? Could he be the son of a sect?” People were confused, as the pill Luo Tian had taken out was clearly not an ordinary one. This made them suspect his identity.

Luo Tian didn’t hesitate and swallowed a fourth-tier pill.

“Hoo… oh…” A wolf-like howl echoed in people’s ears, and a streak of blue lightning appeared beside Luo Tian. Before he could react, it snatched the pill from his hand and devoured it.

Chapter 350: Instant Kill

Chapter 350: Instant Kill

“What is this thing!” People were shocked. The blue light had moved too fast for anyone to react, not even Yu Chengyang could respond in time. His face was filled with anger as he watched the blue light land before Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s gaze narrowed slightly at the blue figure that had taken the pill from his hand. His lips twitched.

“I almost forgot about it!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, watching the blue wolf standing at his feet. Its eyes were greedy as it looked at him.

“Little Wolf… come back!” Leng Qiuchan shouted from the platform, her gaze on the wolf.

“Hoo…” The wolf howled and swallowed the pill in Luo Tian’s mouth, its eyes greedy as it drooled.

“Fool! Do you know who’s pet this is? You dare to attack it!” People marveled, watching Yu Chengyang with disbelief.

The wolf was Leng Qiuchan’s pet; most people here knew that. Who was Leng Qiuchan? The daughter of the Yuling Sect’s sect master. Not only did she have formidable cultivation, but her background was also enough to make a hundred Yu Chengyangs die.

“Roar…” The wolf sensed danger and its fur bristled, a fierce light flashing in its eyes.

The blue figure flickered again, dodging Yu Chengyang’s blade and looking at him with a blue gaze.

“Little Wolf must have recognized me!” Luo Tian thought, looking at Leng Qiuchan on the platform. He was surprised to see that even when attacked, she didn’t descend but only stared coldly at the scene.

“Roar…” The wolf, apparently angered by Yu Chengyang, launched an attack with lightning speed. Its blue eyes glowed with a cold ferocity as it rushed toward Yu Chengyang.

“Hm?” Luo Tian felt the wolf’s speed and was surprised.

The wolf’s speed was so fast that even those Bone-Devouring Initial Stage masters around couldn’t see its form. A streak of blue wind swept past the crowd.

Although Yu Chengyang was a heretical cultivator, his cultivation was only Bone-Devouring Initial Stage. He could fight against a Bone-Devouring Midstage master with special techniques, but his speed was far behind the wolf.

“Roar…” The wolf’s form instantly appeared on Yu Chengyang, and with a powerful impact, he was knocked to the ground.

“Crack…” A faint crackling sound echoed from Yu Chengyang’s body.

Luo Tian narrowed his eyes, watching Yu Chengyang and the wolf. He was astonished.

“Hiss…” The surrounding crowd gasped, their faces filled with intense disbelief as they watched the blue wolf.

“Dead?” A Bone-Devouring Midstage master stammered, his gaze filled with fear as he looked at the wolf.

Yu Chengyang now lay on the ground, his mouth gurgling with blood, his eyes filled with intense disbelief and resentment.

A fierce wound was on Yu Chengyang’s throat, completely torn apart by the wolf’s sharp teeth.

“Hoo…” As if to intimidate those around him, a wolf-like howl echoed in people’s ears.

People stared at the blue wolf standing proudly, their disbelief evident. They couldn’t believe that a powerful heretical cultivator like Yu Chengyang had been killed by this beast, and even more so, that he was instantly killed.

“Self-inflicted death! Don’t blame anyone else!”

Leng Qiuchan’s gaze was cold, not even glancing at the scene. She naturally knew the wolf’s strength, especially its speed. If she hadn’t activated the fourth step of the Heaven-Blocking Step, she might not have been able to keep up.

What she worried about was not the wolf’s safety but why the wolf had reacted so strongly to the pill in Luo Tian’s hand. She had never seen the wolf so obsessed with a pill before. A deep question returned to Leng Qiuchan’s heart.

In Leng Qiuchan’s memory, only one person’s pill could attract the wolf so much.

“Is it time to expose myself?” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly. He knew the wolf must have recognized his pill, so Leng Qiuchan would surely be suspicious.

“But it’s not the time to expose myself yet!” Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly.

“Hoo… hoo…” The wolf’s eyes showed anticipation as it approached Luo Tian, drool trickling from its mouth. At this moment, the wolf looked nothing like the fierce beast it had been before.

Seeing the wolf’s gaze, Luo Tian sighed helplessly and tossed another pill into its mouth, saying, “Little guy, you’ve really gotten me in trouble. After this, take me to that platform!”

“Hoo… hoo…” It seemed the wolf understood Luo Tian’s words. The wolf stood up proudly, letting out a low growl as if making a promise.

“This Yu Chengyang really died in vain, but I can’t blame him. He chose to die himself!” Luo Tian muttered as he approached Yu Chengyang, inserting the Heart-Seeking Dagger into his chest.

“Hum…” A Qi fluctuation spread out, and since Yu Chengyang was a heretical cultivator, the Heart-Seeking Dagger found it to be a great supplement.

“Roar…” As Luo Tian withdrew the dagger, the wolf’s eyes showed fear as it looked at the Heart-Seeking Dagger. Its blue fur bristled.

Withdrawing the dagger, Yu Chengyang’s body turned into a withered corpse like the previous Bone-Devouring Initial Stage youth, under everyone’s stunned gaze.

Luo Tian felt a slight tremor in his heart. This Heart-Seeking Dagger was too terrifying. After absorbing Yu Chengyang’s heretical essence blood, he felt it had the potential to advance to the elite-tier midstage and even seemed to want to break free from Luo Tian’s control.

“Better not use it too often in the future. Without enough strength, I might not be able to control this dagger, and it could even devour me!” Luo Tian thought.

“This blue wolf… is it your daughter’s pet? It seems quite formidable!” Zhao Hongsheng smiled at Leng Hongcai.

“Indeed, the last time my daughter sneaked out, I caught her and she was with this little wolf. At first, I thought it was just a random thing she picked up, but I never expected this little wolf to be such an unusual creature!” Leng Hongcai smiled, his face filled with disbelief. He never thought the wolf’s strength would have increased so much in such a short time.

“But this young man’s dagger should not be in his hands!” Duan Chensheng asked.

Chapter 351: Bullying by Influence

Chapter 351: Bullying by Influence

“Indeed, it shouldn’t be in his hands. Such a strange object could become a major threat if it grows!” Zheng Hongsheng’s face was serious as he looked at the Heart-Seeking Dagger in Luo Tian’s hand.

“Then where should it be placed?” Duan Chensheng asked Zheng Hongsheng.

Among the three major families, Jifeng Valley was the strongest. This matter was usually decided by Zheng Hongsheng.

“I think it should be placed in the Yuling Sect, since they specialize in sealing techniques. It would be sealed away!” Zheng Hongsheng thought for a moment.

Duan Chensheng furrowed his brows slightly, clearly not wanting to place the Heart-Seeking Dagger in the Yuling Sect.

“I still think it would be better for the three sects to take turns keeping it!” It seemed he had noticed Leng Hongcai’s thoughts and smiled slightly.

“Let’s discuss it after the joint recruitment!” Zheng Hongsheng naturally sensed Duan Chensheng’s thoughts and postponed the discussion until after the recruitment.

Behind the three sect masters, the other sect leaders looked disappointed. They could tell from their conversation that they intended to take Luo Tian’s dagger and keep it within the three sects.

Luo Tian retracted the Heart-Seeking Dagger again. At this point, no one dared to approach him. Not only was there that strange dagger in his hand, but also the blue wolf-shaped beast, which made people fear from their hearts.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian lightly patted the wolf’s head, a smile on his face. With the wolf’s intimidation earlier, he was sure the road ahead would be much smoother.

At this moment, the battle on the platform had basically come to an end. People at the edge of the platform were all covered in blood.

Huo Zhiyong, Ding Xiaoyan, and Su Yewu were also caught in the crossfire. Their clothes were stained with blood, their faces showing fierce expressions. After this recruitment, they had grown a lot and were no longer the city lord’s sons and daughters from the secular world. They had truly integrated into the cultivation world.

Although they were all injured, their eyes showed infinite pride as they looked down at the crowd below.

Since the beginning of Kunlun Mountain, native cultivators had always looked down on secular world’s cultivators, believing they were unworthy of being called cultivators.

But now, the three stood proudly on the platform, looking down at those still fighting to attract the attention of the secular sect masters. They felt a sense of satisfaction.

Zheng Xin, Leng Qiuchan, and Duan Xingchen stood among the crowd like stars surrounding the moon. Their faces showed a slight smile.

Zheng Xin had lost his previous chatty image and now wore a serious expression, his eyes constantly watching Luo Tian. If anything happened to him, he would definitely descend from the platform and rescue him.

Leng Qiuchan also cast her gaze toward Luo Tian, a look of confusion in her eyes as she guessed whether Luo Tian was the one she had been looking for. The answer would come from the blue wolf returning to the platform, giving her an answer.

Duan Xingchen also furrowed his brows slightly, sighing inwardly with regret. With the blue wolf’s protection, Luo Tian probably posed no threat. After all, the wolf was behind Leng Qiuchan.

“Damn it! How come this beast is so close to Luo Lei? Did they know each other before?” Duan Xingchen’s face showed confusion as he looked at Leng Qiuchan.

As the three of them gazed, everyone’s eyes were drawn to Luo Tian. However, they all had twitching mouths, some even cursing: “Damn it, is there any justice left?”

Wherever they looked, one man and a wolf walked calmly through the fighting crowd, their faces calm.

Anyone who saw Luo Tian and the blue wolf would step aside, as there were so many people here that it didn’t matter if Luo Tian was one of them.

The situation was clear: the blue wolf under Luo Tian’s command was definitely not ordinary. To kill Luo Tian, one would have to deal with the blue wolf first, which would inevitably offend Leng Qiuchan. Plus, the combined strength of the wolf and Luo Tian was not to be underestimated. This deal would lose no matter how it was calculated.

But everyone felt extremely frustrated. A Body Refinement Ninth Stage kid could walk confidently in front of them, and despite their Bone Devouring Initial or Midstage cultivation, they couldn’t attack. They had to avoid him, and this feeling was extremely uncomfortable.

At that moment, Luo Tian was very relaxed, watching the fighting around him. He slowly approached the base of the platform.

Looking up at those on the platform, he smiled: “I wonder who among you will come down?”

“Arrogant!” The people on the platform roared, thinking Luo Tian had only reached this point because of the blue wolf and Leng Qiuchan’s reputation. Otherwise, with that strange dagger, he wouldn’t have had any chance to get here at all.

“That kid has reached the base of the platform! It seems he wants to get on!”

“Dreaming. He really thinks he can stand up? The platform is filled with the top talents of Kunlun Mountain. Who would let him take that hard-earned spot!” People saw Luo Tian at the base and laughed, discussing.

Duan Xingchen saw Luo Tian below the platform and wore a playful expression. His lips moved slightly, sending his spiritual energy to a white-haired youth standing near the platform’s edge.

That white-haired youth, after hearing Duan Xingchen’s mental message, trembled in his body. His face showed a cold expression and nodded slightly to Duan Xingchen before walking toward the edge of the platform.

“Kid, if you can kill me, then you can stand up!” The white-haired youth, his robe stained with blood, had obviously gone through many battles to reach this position. Standing on the platform, he looked at Luo Tian like an ant.

“Hm?” Seeing the youth’s words, Luo Tian let out a slight laugh, but his eyes carried a coldness.

Luo Tian had to laugh; he was worried no one would provoke him, and this person had come to him. Luo Tian always followed the principle of “if no one provokes me, I won’t provoke them.” This youth had clearly come to provoke him. He would take this opportunity to find a reason to kill him and get on the platform.

“Swoosh!” Luo Tian pushed off the ground, leaving deep footprints beneath him. His body became like an arrow shot from a bow and flew onto the platform, standing before the white-haired youth.

The surrounding people scattered themselves, their faces filled with amusement as they watched this kid actually dare to come up.

Zheng Xin’s face was serious; he recognized the white-haired man. He knew this person was a genius of the Diemo Sect, Wang Lihai, with Bone Devouring Midstage cultivation and a dual-element body type.

Although Luo Tian was only Body Refinement Ninth Stage, people still didn’t believe in him. Wang Lihai had a name among the younger generation of Kunlun Mountain, though not as famous as Leng Qiuchan, Zheng Xin, and Duan Xingchen. He was not an unknown person either.

Luo Tian was just a nameless kid, relying on the blue wolf and Leng Qiuchan’s reputation to reach the base of the platform. Otherwise, this kid wouldn’t even have had the qualifications to get near the platform, let alone challenge Wang Lihai. In people’s eyes, it was definitely a death wish.

“Little Wolf… come back!” Leng Qiuchan coldly called out to the wolf.

“Hoo…” The wolf whimpered and looked at Leng Qiuchan, but its body didn’t move an inch. It still stood before Luo Tian.

“Cold girl, you’d better take back your wolf pet; otherwise, I can’t guarantee it won’t be hurt when we fight!” Wang Lihai spoke. Though he didn’t care about Luo Tian, he couldn’t ignore Leng Qiuchan.

“If it lives, you live; if it is injured, you die!” Leng Qiuchan’s face showed anger. Her mood was already bad, and she wouldn’t give Wang Lihai a good face.

“This…” Wang Lihai was stunned, unable to act immediately. Leng Qiuchan’s reputation wasn’t something to be trifled with.

“Fine, I’ll try not to hurt it!” Wang Lihai felt a bit oppressed. On one hand was Duan Xingchen’s command, and on the other was Leng Qiuchan’s pet. Both were like ancestors that couldn’t be offended.

He thought about how this was all because of the Body Refinement Ninth Stage kid in front of him. Wang Lihai’s face darkened, and a wave of killing intent radiated from him.

“Kill me? Little Wolf! Hold him for a while!” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly, his face showing a cold smile.

“Hoo…” The wolf let out a low growl and became a streak of blue lightning, rushing toward Wang Lihai.

Seeing the wolf rush at him, Wang Lihai’s face showed a bitter smile. He dodged the wolf’s attack and rushed toward Luo Tian with his feet.

But Wang Lihai had underestimated the wolf’s speed. After missing, the wolf showed a bit of annoyance in its eyes and turned around to block Wang Lihai’s path.

“This beast is definitely not ordinary. Just by speed alone, it would be hard for most people on this platform to match!” People marveled as they watched the blue wolf engaging with Wang Lihai.

“No one can command this wolf except me. Could it really be him?” Leng Qiuchan’s face showed confusion as she gazed at Luo Tian again. But when she saw Luo Tian’s actions, her face showed endless anger. She let out a cold hum beneath her black veil: “Idiot!”

“Sister Qiuchan, what’s wrong?” Duan Xingchen showed a bit of concern as he looked at Leng Qiuchan, whose face was somewhat difficult.
