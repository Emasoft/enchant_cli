“Old fellow, what exactly did he see in me?” Luo Tian muttered to himself. He had sensed no hostility from Zhao Tiancheng, which only deepened his confusion.

Luo Tian knew that天上没有掉馅饼的事—there were no free gifts in the heavens. There must be something about himself that had caught Zhao Tiancheng’s attention, otherwise why would someone of Zhao Tiancheng’s status deign to bring him into the Earth Dragon Sect?

“Hmph, still hesitating? Damn it!” Lu Potean, seeing Luo Tian’s hesitation, nearly wanted to beat him senseless.

“Luo Tian…” Long Li, Long Youlan, and Zheng Tiande were all stunned. They hadn’t expected such a rare opportunity to be met with hesitation.

Long Youlan’s face turned crimson. She understood the significance of Zhao Tiancheng bringing Luo Tian into the Earth Dragon Sect, and directly into the inner sect. Even a dunce who entered the inner sect of the Earth Dragon Sect would have an illustrious future.

“I still need to think it over,” Luo Tian repeated, unwilling to commit hastily. If he couldn’t figure out why, an unease would linger in his heart.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Zhao Tiancheng felt a surge of anger. He had already made such concessions—how could this kid still refuse?

Yet Zhao Tiancheng’s anger was tempered by admiration for Luo Tian’s composure. Facing such a temptation, he still maintained his rationality—such a trait was rare.

“Very well. If you refuse, I won’t insist. When you wish to join the Earth Dragon Sect, simply say so. This is my identification token; with it, you may approach me anytime,” Zhao Tiancheng said, tossing a token into Luo Tian’s hands.

“Thank you, elder!” Luo Tian smiled slightly, bowing respectfully to Zhao Tiancheng. Under the envious glances of Lu Potean and Xu Hongtao, he accepted the token.

“Alright. If any of you discover a cultivator who has ascended, report it to me. The Earth Dragon Sect will reward you generously,” Zhao Tiancheng smiled at Long Li, further increasing Luo Tian’s respect for him.

“Yes!” Long Li bowed respectfully. Zhao Tiancheng’s status was such that he spoke with courtesy, far better than Lu Potean and Xu Hongtao’s earlier demeanor.

“Elder, if I join the Earth Dragon Sect, may I bring someone with me—my little sister as well?” Luo Tian asked Zhao Tiancheng, his gaze on him.

“No problem. However, she cannot enter the inner sect directly; the outer sect is acceptable,” Zhao Tiancheng nodded slightly, not refusing Luo Tian’s request.

“Is that allowed?” Lu Potean and Xu Hongtao were utterly flustered. This fellow hadn’t even entered the inner sect, yet he dared to make demands—and Zhao Tiancheng had agreed.

“Is this kid Zhao Tiancheng’s long-lost son? Even a biological son wouldn’t get such treatment!” Lu Potean and Xu Hongtao marveled inwardly.

“Is there anything else?” Zhao Tiancheng smiled, his gaze on Luo Tian.

“Elder, when you leave, please throw out the trash for me,” Luo Tian said, his gaze on Zhao Tiancheng. He had observed Zhao Tiancheng’s eyes closely and formed some suspicions.

“Very well, I’ll leave now. In the Earth Dragon Sect, I await your arrival,” Zhao Tiancheng smiled, then glanced at Lu Potean and Xu Hongtao.

“Whooosh!” Zhao Tiancheng waved his hand, and a gust of wind surged, instantly enveloping Lu Potean and Xu Hongtao.

“Get out of here! No more meddling!” Zhao Tiancheng sneered, his voice echoing in their ears as they flew backward. Their figures grew smaller until they fell outside the Dragon Roar City.

“Old man bids farewell! I hope you choose my Earth Dragon Sect if you truly attend the exam,” Zhao Tiancheng smiled, having made enough concessions. His figure shimmered and vanished from Luo Tian’s sight.

“Earlier, he looked at me twice,” Luo Tian mused, touching the token on his waist. He had formed a guess.

“Star River Sect inner sect identification token? Did he think I was an inner sect disciple of Star River Sect?” Luo Tian pondered, recalling how the Star River Sect’s spirit had said that Star River Sect’s influence in the Immortal Realm was vast.

“Luo Tian has a great opportunity!” Long Li, seeing Zhao Tiancheng leave, sighed. Though he didn’t know why Zhao Tiancheng had appeared in Dragon Roar City and immediately proposed this, Luo Tian’s intention was clear—he wanted to bring Long Youlan into the Earth Dragon Sect.

“Let’s prepare and set off. Let’s go participate in the Heaven Dragon Sect’s exam,” Luo Tian smiled.

“Alright!” Long Li, seeing Luo Tian as if nothing had happened, felt admiration but also a touch of regret.

Yet Zhao Tiancheng was already far away. Long Li’s regret was futile; he sighed deeply, leading Long Youlan and Zheng Tiande out of Luo Tian’s courtyard.

“Xiao Qing… come, it's noon. Time to train,” Luo Tian called into the courtyard after Long Youlan and Long Li left.

He then turned back to the courtyard. The Howling Moon Wolf King let out a low growl, kneeling before Luo Tian. It opened its mouth and exhaled a stream of blue energy, while a golden mark hovered above Luo Tian’s head, absorbing the blue energy.

Time passed slowly. An hour slipped by unnoticed. Luo Tian stood up, and Long Youlan and Long Li were already at the gate.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian smiled, leading the Howling Moon Wolf King out of the gate.

“Long Li, I’ve prepared a carriage for you. There’s still time; you can travel at your leisure,” Long Li smiled, gesturing to the carriage behind them.

Two white horses stood tall and pristine. The carriage was grand, clearly luxurious.

“You see how kind my father is? Last time I said I’d go for the exam, he let me go alone without even a white dragon horse. These two are my father’s favorite,” Long Youlan pouted.

“Respectful elder, as long as I’m here, I’ll ensure Youlan’s safety,” Luo Tian smiled, bowing to Long Li.

“Don’t call me ‘respectful elder’ anymore. I’m actually a bit uncomfortable with it,” Long Li smiled bitterly. If age alone was the measure, he could call Luo Tian ‘elder’.

“Let’s go! Let’s go…” Long Youlan, seeing them talking nonsense, urged them. She twisted her body and leapt into the carriage with excitement.

“Farewell!” Luo Tian bowed to Long Li again, then sat outside the carriage. He patted the horses, and they galloped forward, carrying Luo Tian and Long Youlan out of Dragon Roar City.

The white dragon horses were remarkably intelligent, needing no urging to gallop swiftly along the road toward the Heaven Dragon Sect.

……

As one of the three major powers in the Lower Heavens, the Heaven Dragon Sect naturally exuded grandeur. Its recruitment of disciples inevitably stirred the Lower Heavens, with many self-proclaimed talented individuals preparing to journey there in hopes of a meteoric rise.

The Heaven Dragon Mountains, the foundation of the Heaven Dragon Sect, stretched endlessly like a dragon coiled in the clouds.

The Heaven Dragon City lay at the foot of the mountains. Standing within it, one could see the coiled dragon in the sky.

At that moment, Heaven Dragon City was bustling. Figures descended from the skies or entered through its gates—each young.

“Clippity-clop…” Two white steeds galloped across the land, arriving at Heaven Dragon City’s outskirts in an instant.

On the carriage sat a young man leaning against the back, feigning sleep. When they reached the city gates, he slowly opened his eyes, a stream of blue energy swirling within them.

“Ah… finally arrived!” The carriage curtain lifted, and a slender figure leapt down, stretching her arms. Her perfect form drew the attention of those around.

They were Luo Tian and Long Youlan, who had traveled for over four months. Now weary, they arrived at the outskirts of Heaven Dragon City.

“Back home!” Luo Tian patted the white dragon horse, which had become more agile over four months. The horse gazed at him with reluctance, nuzzling his body before turning the carriage and galloping back.

“Let’s go in. We can rest,” Luo Tian smiled, addressing Long Youlan. He wasn’t worried about the horse’s safety; its speed was beyond even a Daoist Realm cultivator. Their four-month journey had been due to Long Youlan’s playful nature.

“Hmm,” Long Youlan nodded, gazing at the city that was several times larger than Dragon Roar City. Her eyes reflected admiration for the grand Heaven Dragon Mountains.

“Roar…” As they prepared to enter, a roar echoed behind them. Two colossal creatures appeared.

Blue scales, thick limbs—each step caused the ground to tremble. Their massive bodies radiated wild energy.

“Blue Scale Serpents!” The crowd gasped, watching the massive forms approach Heaven Dragon City. Each step shook the ground.

Standing atop them were a young man and woman—handsome and beautiful, like a pair born for each other.

The two white dragon horses, just turned around, trembled in fear. Their strong legs quivered.

“Roar…” Seeing the white dragon horses, the Blue Scale Serpents roared, as if spotting prey. They opened their mouths wide and lunged toward the horses.

Chapter 1785: Confrontation

“Ah…” Long Youlan’s face paled. The white dragon horses were Long Li’s favorite, and she had loved riding them since childhood. Now that they faced danger, her heart raced with panic.

“Two fine horses—too bad! Old horses know the way home; they could return alone. But now, they’ll perish here!” The crowd sighed, envisioning the white dragon horses devoured by the beast.

Yet the young man and woman atop the Blue Scale Serpents seemed indifferent, their gazes fixed on the vast Heaven Dragon Mountains.

“Cousin, it seems not only the Heaven Dragon Sect is recruiting. The other two major powers have also arrived. So we can choose to enter the Heaven Dragon Sect, or even the Earth Dragon Sect or Iron Dragon Sect,” the young man smiled.

“Get lost…” Luo Tian, seeing the Blue Scale Serpents’ maw approaching the horses, glared coldly. He vanished in a gust of wind before the young man’s words ended, appearing before the white dragon horses. He didn’t even glance at the approaching maw but gently patted the trembling horses.

“Who is this fool?” The crowd gasped, staring at Luo Tian before the white dragon horses.

“Don’t blame others for your own death!” The young man on the Blue Scale Serpents shook his head. He wouldn’t stop it, and even if he did now, it was too late.

In an instant, the crimson maw reached Luo Tian. His figure seemed tiny before it.

Yet just as the maw was about to swallow him and the horses, a fierce wolf roar echoed.

“Wooosh…” A blue mark hovered above Luo Tian’s head. The Howling Moon Wolf King appeared before him, its eyes fierce.

At the sight of the Howling Moon Wolf King, the Blue Scale Serpents froze. A powerful pressure made its massive body tremble.

“Roar…” The Howling Moon Wolf King roared again, forcing the Blue Scale Serpents to kneel. The young man and woman atop it swayed violently.

“What is that?” The crowd was stunned, staring at the Howling Moon Wolf King before Luo Tian.

“Is it the Howling Moon Wolf? No, it’s the Howling Moon Wolf King!” After a brief silence, someone recognized it.

“The Howling Moon Wolves are pack animals. They’re wild and hard to tame. What method did this youth use? How could he subdue the Howling Moon Wolf King, and one of Heavenly Dao Realm strength!” The crowd was awestruck, staring at the Howling Moon Wolf King as if it were a monster.

“Alright, go back. Next time, run when you encounter this. This beast can’t outrun you!” Luo Tian gently patted the white dragon horse’s head, smiling as he spoke to it.

“Neigh…” The white dragon horse responded with a few calls, no longer afraid. It turned its rump and glanced at the Blue Scale Serpents with a taunting look, as if to say: “You’re not so tough now.”

“Beast…” As Luo Tian sent the white dragon horse away, a furious voice echoed from above. The young man on the Blue Scale Serpents drew his sword, a golden blade flashing toward Luo Tian and the Howling Moon Wolf King.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed coldly. An invisible gust of energy radiated from him, and the blue mark above his head pulsed.

“Wooosh…” The Howling Moon Wolf King howled, spitting out a black moon from its mouth. It collided with the young man’s sword strike.

Before the young man could act again, the Blue Scale Serpents let out a roar. Its bloodshot eyes gradually turned blue.

The roar echoed, and the Blue Scale Serpents’ massive body trembled violently. Its body slammed against the ground, as if trying to throw off the young man and woman atop it.

“What’s happening!” The young man and woman exchanged glances, then leapt into the air to calm the Blue Scale Serpents.

But the Blue Scale Serpents ignored their calming, its massive body rising and lunging toward them.

“Boom…” The massive body shook the ground. In an instant, it was before the stunned young man and woman, its maw wide open to devour them.

The crowd was stunned. Who would have thought a beast would attack its own master? It was beyond their expectations.

The young man hadn’t anticipated this. He leapt in front of the woman, and as his body blocked her path, the maw descended.

“Open!” The young man roared, generating waves of energy. He punched toward the Blue Scale Serpents’ maw.

“Crack…” A crisp sound echoed. The Blue Scale Serpents’ sharp teeth shattered halfway, emitting a painful roar. Its massive body was thrown back, colliding with the ground and creating a large pit.

“Celestial Dao Realm! Two Celestial Dao Realm cultivators! Such youth, already at the Celestial Dao Realm!” The crowd marveled, gazing at the two standing in the sky.

“Didn’t you see the youth with the Howling Moon Wolf King also at the Celestial Dao Realm?” The crowd then noticed Luo Tian standing on the ground, arms crossed and watching the scene.

“Boom…” As the crowd marveled, the Blue Scale Serpents’ massive body rose again. Its limbs pressed against the ground like a madman, rushing toward the young man once more.

“Die!” The young man was now furious. He didn’t know why the Blue Scale Serpents had changed, but he punched again.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” The heavy sound echoed. The young man’s punches struck the Blue Scale Serpents’ body repeatedly, each collision causing it to crash into the ground. Yet it always rose again, rushing toward the young man.

“Boom…” After half a bell, the Blue Scale Serpents’ massive body crashed into the ground and didn’t rise again. Its body was now a pile of flesh, covered in blood, weak but not dead—after all, it was a Blue Scale Serpent of the Heavenly Dao Realm. The young man still hesitated to kill it.

A stream of blue energy radiated from the Blue Scale Serpents, turning its eyes blood-red again.

“Half a bell? And it’s only at the Heavenly Dao Realm. Time is too short!” Luo Tian shook his head slightly, then patted the Howling Moon Wolf King’s head like patting a puppy. He walked toward Long Youlan, her eyes sparkling.

“Did I say you could leave?” A cold voice echoed from the sky. The young man’s sword flashed again, golden energy slicing toward Luo Tian.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian frowned slightly. He had intended to let things cool down, but he hadn’t sought out the young man. Now the young man had come to him.

“Who do you think you are?” The young man’s voice was icy. His sword flashed again.

“Don’t you know who I am?” The young man’s face turned cold, eyes filled with killing intent.

“Don’t know. Never heard of you. Who cares!” Luo Tian shouted back, a defiant reply that nearly choked the young man.

Before the young man could swallow his anger, Luo Tian stepped on the ground and flew toward him.

“Endless patience. You’re overstepping!” A cold voice echoed through the heavens as Luo Tian’s figure appeared before the young man, his fist charging toward him.

“Since you seek death, I’ll grant it!” The young man’s face also bore killing intent. His sword glowed with radiant light, slicing toward Luo Tian.

“Wooosh…” Luo Tian’s fist didn’t stop. His other hand held a golden spear, colliding with the young man’s sword.

Chapter 1786: Elder Brother Enters Father

“Crack…” The golden spear collided with the golden sword, like a thunderclap in clear skies. At the same time, Luo Tian’s powerful fist struck toward the young man’s body. If it landed, he was certain the youth would suffer a dire fate.

“Strong!” The young man’s face changed. After clashing with Luo Tian, his entire arm was numb, and he could barely hold the sword.

“If this punch lands on me, even if I don’t die, I’ll be severely injured!” The young man panicked. He wanted to block but couldn’t match Luo Tian’s speed.

“Wooosh…” Just as Luo Tian’s fist was about to touch the young man’s shoulder, a delicate hand appeared in front of his fist, grasping it.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian frowned slightly. He saw the delicate face before him and felt a strange force on his hand, deflecting his power.

“Force breaks all methods!” Luo Tian muttered coldly. Golden seals spread across his arm, and the ultimate power surged.

“Boom…” A heavy sound echoed. With full strength, Luo Tian struck the delicate hand and the young man’s shoulder.

The young man was thrown back dozens of paces. The woman stood before him, her face filled with concern.

“Strong… even the Blue Lotus’s Cloud-Soaring Hand couldn’t block his attack!” The young man was stunned. He hadn’t even entered Heaven Dragon City or taken the exam yet, and he had already met a formidable opponent.

“Defeating two at once!” The crowd gazed in amazement at Luo Tian standing in the sky, and they murmured.

“Still, that woman’s strength is formidable. Just the speed she displayed—few in the Celestial Dao Realm could match it!” The crowd gazed at the woman.

“Esteemed elder, my name is Wan Youlan. This is my cousin, Du Changtian. If there was any offense, I beg your forgiveness,” the woman smiled, her voice as beautiful as a blooming flower.

“Wan Youlan, Du Changtian. Those names sound familiar,” the crowd murmured.

“Wan Youlan of Wanlong City!” Someone suddenly recalled, their faces filled with disbelief.

“Is it the daughter of the fourth-ranked city in the Ten Cities, Wan Youlan!” The crowd erupted.

“Wanlong City?” Luo Tian frowned slightly. He had heard of many cities on his journey—ten major cities, known throughout the Lower Heavens. Wanlong City ranked fourth.

Though it was fourth, everyone knew that the top three cities were like Heaven Dragon City, their foundations built by the Heaven Dragon Sect. If one didn’t consider the top three cities, Wanlong City would rank first.

“Hearing that Wan Youlan’s talent is also remarkable. Her body type is rare—a furnace-type body, which allows one to cultivate twice as fast as normal!”

“Hearing that the Heaven Dragon Sect has already decided on Wan Youlan’s inner sect qualification. Several elders are vying for her, hoping to pair her with their disciples or descendants!” The crowd whispered, gazing at the woman in the sky.

“Du Changtian isn’t simple either. His city, Changkong City, is eighth-ranked and closely allied with Wanlong City. They are relatives!” The crowd then turned their gaze to Luo Tian.

“Who is this man who defeated Wan Youlan and Du Changtian? Why have I never heard of him?” The crowd whispered, unsure of who Luo Tian was.

“Still fighting? I’m leaving!” Luo Tian stood there, addressing Wan Youlan and Du Changtian.

“You…” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Du Changtian’s face darkened as if about to drown. But he now knew Luo Tian was no pushover.

“What did I do?”

“You started it! You wanted to eat my horses and acted like you were right. What are you?” Luo Tian sneered, arms crossed.

“Who is causing trouble outside my Heaven Dragon City!” Before Luo Tian’s words ended, a dignified voice echoed through the city. A long rainbow streaked from Heaven Dragon City and appeared in their sight.

The middle-aged man looked about the same age as Long Li but radiated an intimidating aura. His robes fluttered, giving a sense of authority.

“Celestial Dao Realm Intermediate!” Luo Tian’s heart tightened. He immediately sensed the middle-aged man’s cultivation—this was the first Celestial Dao Realm Intermediate he had seen, excluding Zhao Tiancheng.

“Strong…” Luo Tian’s first impression was this man’s power. Zhao Tiancheng’s strength made him feel powerless, but this middle-aged man’s strength, though weaker than Zhao Tiancheng’s, made Luo Tian feel he wouldn’t be a match after a hundred rounds.

“Sky Dragon City Lord, Zuo Qiuming!” The crowd gasped, their faces filled with respect as they gazed at Zuo Qiuming in the sky.

Sky Dragon City Lord, though his title seemed merely a city lord, everyone knew that Sky Dragon City was backed by the Heaven Dragon Sect. In secular matters, the Sky Dragon City Lord could be considered a representative of the Heaven Dragon Sect.

“Respect Sky Dragon City Lord!” On the ground, people bowed and clasped their fists.

“You three are the troublemakers?” Zuo Qiuming’s face was cold. He gazed at Luo Tian and the others, scanning them with a slight frown.

“Lord Zuo, I am Wan Youlan of Wanlong City. This is my cousin, Du Changtian, son of the Changkong City Lord. I apologize for any offense,” Wan Youlan spoke softly, bowing slightly to Zuo Qiuming.

“Ah, it’s Wan Youlan of Wanlong City. I’ve heard of her before. Indeed, she is more impressive in person than in reputation!” Zuo Qiuming’s face paused slightly before he laughed.

“Who is this young man?” He then turned his gaze to Luo Tian, sensing something unusual about him.

“Luo Tian of Dragon Roar City!” Luo Tian spoke softly, bowing to Zuo Qiuming.

“Dragon Roar City?” Hearing Luo Tian’s name, the crowd was puzzled. Dragon Roar City Lord Long Li was merely a Daoist Realm cultivator, naturally not worthy of the attention of these major cities.

“Ah, it’s a small city. Its Lord is named Long Li and has Daoist Realm cultivation,” but Dragon Roar City, though small, was known to some.

“Lord is Daoist Realm, but he has a Celestial Dao Realm disciple. This youth’s talent is truly extraordinary!” The crowd marveled, their gazes toward Luo Tian changing.

“Three geniuses. I assume you all came for the Heaven Dragon Sect’s recruitment. Why fight outside the city? The exam is what you care about, isn’t it?”

“So give me a favor and don’t delay others from entering. Resolve your grudges during the exam!” Zuo Qiuming smiled, but his words carried a strong and unyielding tone.

“Respectful elder’s words are heeded,” Luo Tian replied.

“Also, Master Luo, this was a misunderstanding. Please forgive us!” Wan Youlan gazed at Luo Tian, appearing pitiful and making others feel she was the victim.

“Such a clever girl!” Luo Tian mused inwardly. She had already smoothed over the incident, making it seem as if he were the rude one.

“Haha. Since Youlan called me ‘Master Luo,’ this was just a misunderstanding. I won’t hold it against you. After all, elder brother is like father!” Luo Tian laughed, emphasizing the words “elder brother is like father.”

Long Youlan stood on the ground and laughed heartlessly. Though she knew Luo Tian was older than her father, others didn’t know that—this was clearly taking advantage of Wan Youlan.

“You…” Du Changtian’s face turned red and pale. He had never been so openly mocked before, and Wan Youlan’s eyes flashed a brief killing intent but vanished quickly.

“Alright. You may enter the city now. Don’t cause trouble inside, or you’ll know the consequences!” Zuo Qiuming saw signs of another fight and his face darkened.

“Then I’ll enter the city first. I hope Master Luo shines brightly in the exam. But exams can be dangerous, so be careful!” Wan Youlan smiled, no longer calling Luo Tian “Master Luo.”

“Of course. Didn’t you see how strong I am? I heard Youlan’s body type is special. How about we test it one day?” Luo Tian smiled, scanning Wan Youlan.

“Little girl, you’re still too young to challenge me!” Luo Tian sneered inwardly. He then bowed to Zuo Qiuming: “Lord Zuo, I’ll enter the city first. If Lord Zuo feels unwell, you can find me.”

“Hmph?” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Zuo Qiuming’s gaze narrowed slightly. He didn’t understand why the boy suddenly said that.

“Did he sense something?” Zuo Qiuming mused, thinking of his health. But he shook his head—his condition was beyond even the Heaven Dragon Sect’s alchemy masters, and this boy couldn’t possibly know.

Luo Tian ignored Zuo Qiuming and others. He then flew down to Long Youlan, took her hand, and walked into Heaven Dragon City. The Howling Moon Wolf King also transformed into a miniature form, resembling a puppy with a wagging tail, following Luo Tian.

“Two geniuses. Let’s deal with this first,” Zuo Qiuming gazed at the half-dead Blue Scale Serpent on the ground, then waved his sleeve and flew back into Heaven Dragon City.

Chapter 1787: The Dragon Soars High

Heaven Dragon City had been bustling for days, with everyone discussing the Heaven Dragon Sect’s exam. As the exam approached, nearly all the geniuses of the Lower Heavens had entered Heaven Dragon City. The city was packed.

Luo Tian and Long Youlan found a small inn to stay in. After several days, Long Youlan dragged Luo Tian around the city.

“Luo Tian brother, I want this!”

“Luo Tian brother, buy it for me, okay?” Long Youlan was like a little sprite, curious about everything. Their financial power had been entrusted to Luo Tian by Long Li.

“Okay…” Luo Tian smiled, indulging her. What she wanted weren’t expensive items, so he satisfied her shopping desires.

“Ah… I’m tired!” After wandering all day, they sat down to eat.

“Comrade, you look like a fine young man. I assume you’re here for the Heaven Dragon Sect’s entrance exam!” As they sat down, a slightly猥琐 voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ear.

A thin figure appeared before them. The restaurant was noisy, so no one noticed the young man’s presence.

The youth wore tattered clothes. His small eyes glimmered with a strange light—Luo Tian was familiar with this gaze; he often saw it in Sun Kedian’s eyes.

“Taking me for a fat sheep!” Luo Tian’s first thought was that the youth would surely take advantage of him.

“Yes…” Luo Tian nodded slightly. This youth clearly was a local thug, and he wanted to understand the situation, so he didn’t drive him away.

“Comrade, I’ll introduce myself. My name is Long Zaitian. ‘Long’ comes from the phrase ‘Dragon Soars High’!”

“In Heaven Dragon City, people call me the Sky Dragon Expert. I know everything in Heaven Dragon City. No matter what happens, it won’t escape my ears. I know how many lovers Widow Li has… how many mouse holes the City Lord’s mansion has…” Long Zaitian boasted, his words flowing.

“Stop… stop…” Luo Tian quickly stopped the youth’s endless boasting. The spittle was almost on his face.

“Ah, comrade, I felt a connection with you. So I told you this! Do you have any questions? Feel free to ask. You must be new here, so you don’t know much about Heaven Dragon City!” Long Zaitian smiled, grabbed the wine glass on the table, and took a drink without hesitation.

“Looks like he’s here to eat for free!” Long Youlan pouted, watching Long Zaitian grab Luo Tian’s chopsticks and start eating.

“How do you break through to the Celestial Dao Realm?” Luo Tian asked softly, ignoring Long Zaitian’s actions.

“Cough… cough…” Hearing Luo Tian’s question, Long Zaitian spat out the wine he had just swallowed. He then coughed violently.

“Old man, this is beyond my scope…” Long Zaitian grinned, gazing at Luo Tian. “How about you ask another question?”

“What’s the realm beyond the Celestial Dao Realm?” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Long Zaitian.
