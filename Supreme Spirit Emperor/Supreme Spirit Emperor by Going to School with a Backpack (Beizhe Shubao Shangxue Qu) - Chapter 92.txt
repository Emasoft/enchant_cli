“Forgive me, father. I cannot avenge you... I am useless. Today, I shall die here!” Wu Di felt his legs growing heavier, his mind whispering endlessly.

“Enough! End him!” Qi Derong had no patience to act himself, barking at his three sons.

Chapter 450: Hard Work ()

Chapter 450: Hard Work

Hearing his father’s words, the three Qi brothers said nothing. Their long blades transformed into blinding arcs of cutting energy, slicing toward Wu Di, already weakened to the brink.

Wu Di had endured this long through sheer willpower. Though these three slashes seemed unimpressive, they were beyond his current capacity to withstand.

“Farewell, my brothers!” Wu Di ignored the descending blades and turned, shielding over a hundred of his men behind him. His gaze carried regret as he looked at his subordinates.

“Elder!”
“Big brother!” The remaining hundred were men who had faced death with Wu Di. Their strength was undeniable; their survival until now proved it.

Seeing Wu Di in peril, all of them wore expressions of despair, eyes flashing with bloodlust.

“Kill…” The hundred men erupted into a frenzy, charging toward Wu Di with wild abandon.

This was the sect of Beichang—though they cherished life, at critical moments, even death would not stop them from dragging others down with them.

“Hmph. Boy, it’s your misfortune to be born into the Wu family. It’s your weakness that seals your fate!” Qi Derong smirked, leading his three sons away. To him, Wu Di’s survival was impossible beneath their blades; the rest would be dealt with later.

“Begone…” But as Qi Derong and his sons turned, a crushing pressure descended upon the remaining thousands. A single voice echoed through two thousand ears.

“Who!” Qi Derong and his sons gaped, eyes locking onto four figures in the distance.

The three slashes aimed at Wu Di shattered mid-air, dissolving into swirling energy that mingled with the bloodstained air.

The overwhelming pressure caused the sect disciples to break into cold sweat, their legs trembling as they froze in place.

“Soul Realm!” Qi Feiying’s face darkened, his brows furrowed as he gazed at the four approaching figures.

“Old dog, long time no see!” Luo Tian’s voice rang out, laced with mockery.

“Luo Tian!” Qi Derong blinked in disbelief. He had assumed Luo Tian would never dare return to Beichang. Yet here he stood, a mere four youths.

“Luo Tian?” Han and Zhao’s clan leaders furrowed their brows, confusion turning to greed as they eyed Luo Tian. They knew he possessed a grade-A martial art and countless treasures.

Wu Di recognized the newcomers, his face flickering with surprise. Luo Tian had always been a godlike figure to him; though he’d once been weak, Wu Di knew time would make Luo Tian great. Yet he hadn’t expected him to return so soon, alone with just four men.

The Qi brothers also wore surprise—Qi Tianchu’s face twisted into grimace, recalling Luo Tian’s humiliation in Beiming City.

“Didn’t think he’d dare return,” Qi Tianba’s face lit with battlelust, his eyes burning toward Luo Tian.

Qi Tianxiong’s expression was cold as he watched Luo Tian stride forward, radiating power.

Luo Tian and his three companions strode forth like sovereigns, their pressure crushing the sect disciples into silence.

“Die!” A disciple, overwhelmed by the pressure, lunged forward with his sword.

Luo Tian and cold autumn cicadas ignored him, continuing their march.

As the youth neared them, Luo Tian smiled, flicking his finger. A droplet of water-element energy burst forth from his fingertip.

“Pfth!” The droplet struck the disciple’s chest, erupting into a crimson bloom. He collapsed lifelessly.

“Sss…” The crowd gasped in unison.

“Soul Realm!” Qi Derong’s face finally showed fear. He’d assumed Luo Tian merely reached the Bone-Subjugation Stage, but this display of externalized energy confirmed his Soul Realm status.

“Old dog, surprised?” Luo Tian’s smirk deepened as he approached Wu Di, pressing a pill into his mouth.

“Elder!” Wu Di’s face lit with joy, his eyes burning with fervor toward Luo Tian.

“Hard work, now it’s my turn,” Luo Tian patted Wu Di’s shoulder, signaling Zheng Xin to tend to him.

“Who is this guy?”
“I don’t know… why does our elder call him ‘elder’?”
“He’s younger than me!” The hundred remaining men exchanged puzzled glances, speculating on the young man’s identity.

But then they stilled, recalling their elder’s constant mention of a name—someone they’d never met but knew was Wu Di’s god.

“Elder!” The thin youth spoke up.

Luo Tian surveyed Wu Di’s men, smiling as he waved his hand. A surge of wood-element energy enveloped the hundred.

“You all did well. Your brothers’ blood won’t be in vain. I, Luo Tian, will make them pay with their own!” His voice carried an enchanting power, reigniting the men’s bloodlust.

“Pay with their own!” A voice roared, filling the battlefield.

Luo Tian nodded at the hundred, who were elite warriors of Beichang. With time, they could become a secret weapon—his alchemy skills would sustain them.

“Rest now. I’ll take over,” Luo Tian barked at the hundred, his gaze turning icy toward Qi Derong’s sons and the distant clan leaders, including Yang Huanyu.

Chapter 451: The Power of the Soul Realm ()

Chapter 451: The Power of the Soul Realm

Seeing Luo Tian’s gaze, Qi Derong and his sons shuddered. But as they glanced at the two thousand disciples and Qi Feiying in the distance, their confidence returned.

“Boy, though you’re a Soul Realm master, we have two thousand here. Can you truly face us?” Qi Derong’s tone was cold.

Luo Tian said nothing, hands outstretched. A torrent of fire dragons burst from his ten fingers, surging toward Qi Derong and the two thousand disciples.

Luo Tian had ascended to Soul Realm, mastering grade-B martial arts effortlessly—each fire dragon’s power rivaled high-grade B. They circled above the crowd.

“Five… ten… a hundred…” The dragons roared, plunging into the masses.

The crowd’s confusion deepened; though Luo Tian’s technique was amplified, it remained within grade-B. While difficult to evade, it couldn’t kill them outright.

“Is this your trump card for returning to Beichang?” Qi Derong shattered a fire dragon with a punch, sneering.

“Hmph. You chased me like a dog for that grade-A martial art. Now I return it to you!” Luo Tian sneered.

“Explosive…” Luo Tian’s lips curled as he unleashed his spiritual awareness across the hundred fire dragons.

As his words ended, the dragons detonated mid-air, raining embers down.

“Hah! This is a Soul Realm master? Can’t even control his technique!” The crowd laughed, mocking the dragons’ premature explosions.

Qi Feiying and others stood apart, puzzled by Luo Tian’s tactics but wary of his power. A youth so young reaching Soul Realm was no ordinary foe.

“Another trick! Still, these two thousand will be useful,” Yang Huanyu mused, a sly smile on his face.

“Fen Tian! Inferno Array!” Luo Tian bellowed, slapping the ground. His face twisted with grim determination.

“Boom!” As he spoke, a sea of fire erupted before Qi Derong’s men could react.

The inferno devoured the sky, its power now fully unleashed by Luo Tian’s Soul Realm. He extended a water-element energy barrier to shield Cold Autumn Cicadas and Wu Di’s men from the heat.

“Damn!” Qi Feiying grimaced, stunned by Luo Tian’s hidden strength. A grade-A martial art in Beichang—unthinkable.

Han and Zhao’s clan leaders paled, watching the flames turn violet from their intensity. Their gazes toward Luo Tian brimmed with terror, fingers clutching jade talismans to summon aid.

“Ah!” Screams echoed as cultivators were reduced to ash. Bone-Subjugation Stage masters fell within seconds, burning alive.

“Elder’s might!” The thin youth roared, eyes wild with admiration. Others snapped out of their stupor, staring at Luo Tian with fervent gazes. They’d never imagined their elder’s strength could be this overwhelming—half the crowd was wiped out instantly, the numbers dwindling further.

“We can’t let this continue!” Qi Feiying’s face darkened. This raid had cost the Qi clan their full strength; now, under Luo Tian’s strike, they faced heavy losses.

“Buzz…” Qi Feiying’s spiritual wings unfurled, and in an instant, he soared into the sky. His hands moved rapidly.

“Sacred Water Dragon Cry!” Qi Feiying roared, summoning clouds that birthed swirling water dragons. They surged toward the firestorm below.

“Sss…” Mist rose, obscuring sight.

“Hmph,” Zheng Xin exhaled, standing beside Luo Tian. Wind-element energy coalesced, dispersing the mist.

The battlefield revealed a charred wasteland—no corpses remained, only ash carried by the wind.

“Three hundred…,” a man from Wu Di’s group stammered, staring at the aftermath.

“A Soul Realm master’s power!” The crowd marveled, gazing at Luo Tian and Qi Feiying.

“One grade-A martial art, eliminating 1,700 Bone-Subjugation Stage masters! Few Soul Realm masters could achieve this!” Han Lihui mused, admiration in his eyes.

“Hmph. Once our elders arrive, he’ll be finished. For now, we must hold,” Zhao Hongyi hissed, eyes burning with intent.

Qi Derong and his sons trembled, their contempt for Luo Tian replaced by fear. Earlier, only their combined array had saved them from the firestorm.

“Elders, save us!” Qi Derong gasped, eyes wide as he called to Qi Feiying.

Luo Tian’s gaze lifted, surprise flickering at Qi Tianba and his brothers. He hadn’t expected the Qi clan’s sons to survive his onslaught, let alone protect so many.

“Though they lived, how long can they endure?” Luo Tian’s eyes darkened as he gripped his spear. A storm of golden waves swept over the remaining three hundred.

“Arrogant!” Qi Feiying’s face flushed with anger, his form transforming into a blue eagle as he flew toward Qi Derong.

Chapter 452: Annihilation ()

Chapter 452: Annihilation

Seeing an elder Soul Realm master shield Qi Derong, Luo Tian sneered. His Golden Sea Sifting Sand technique didn’t stop; he channeled five-element energy into it, amplifying its power.

Five elements harmonizing—Golden Sea Sifting Sand! Luo Tian’s lips curled as he observed the technique’s power now nearly tripled.

The golden waves surged, each capable of annihilating Bone-Subjugation Stage initiates. Yet Qi Feiying’s face paled as he faced it, unaware this was Luo Tian’s calculated strike.

“Eagle Strike the Sky!” Qi Feiying hissed, transforming into a blue eagle. His spiritual energy lifted three hundred disciples skyward.

The crowd gasped, awestruck. Soul Realm masters transcended ordinary warriors—this display was breathtaking.

Above the golden sea, a blue eagle soared, dodging waves while hunting prey.

After minutes, the waves calmed. The eagle landed, Qi Feiying’s face drenched in sweat. Though Soul Realm masters could harness elemental energy, carrying three hundred disciples aloft demanded more than that. Qi Feiying had relied on his own energy, compounded by Beichang’s sparse spiritual atmosphere.

Yang Huanyu stood among clan leaders, his eyes gleaming. He recalled his own Soul Realm ascension—his final trial had shown Luo Tian’s form, igniting a fierce battlelust.

“Though regrettable, you die today. No escape this time!” Yang Huanyu’s eyes glinted with malice.

As his words ended, the soul-absorbing pearl beneath the ground erupted, absorbing the 1,700 disciples’ blood. It surged underground, radiating bloodlust.

“Then finish you first!” Luo Tian’s expression remained cold. He pointed his spear, seven-colored wings unfurling as he soared skyward. The second form of his Splitting Heaven Spear, “Stone Shattered,”凝聚.

“Seven-colored wings! Seven-element affinity! Is he even human?”
“I recall he had five elements before. How could he gain two more in a year? Did he hide his power?” Han Lihui and Zhao Hongyi marveled, eyes wide at the seven-colored wings.

“Crap! Our elder has seven-element affinity!”
“Our elder’s might!”
“Unbelievable! A prodigy!” The crowd could find no words to describe Luo Tian.

A sect’s acceptance of a dual-element affinity was hailed as genius; now, seven elements left them speechless.

“Eagle Strike the Sky!” Qi Feiying’s lips twitched. He had no confidence to face Luo Tian but could not retreat—behind him were Qi Derong and his sons. If he fled, the clan would perish.

Qi Feiying transformed into an eagle again, charging toward Luo Tian’s golden spear.

The golden wave accelerated instantly, a golden phantom piercing Qi Feiying’s eagle form.

Boom! The clash created fissures in the air, leaving the ground-bound crowd awestruck.

“Is this Soul Realm’s might?” Their minds reeled, stunned by the clash rarely seen in Beichang.

Seeing Luo Tian battle Qi Feiying, the Qi brothers grimaced. They remembered his former strength—now he’d ascended to Soul Realm, leaving them in the dust.

As awe filled the crowd, the battle reached its climax. Qi Feiying’s face was pale, enduring Luo Tian’s assault.

Though Luo Tian had only recently reached Soul Realm, his power far exceeded ordinary initiates. His seven-element affinity, spiritual energy communication with the world, and formidable soul—all surpassed typical Soul Realm masters.

Qi Feiying had reached Soul Realm only six months prior, surviving through Beichang’s sparse spiritual atmosphere and countless battles. Otherwise, he’d have perished under Luo Tian’s spear.

Luo Tian remained expressionless, having unleashed all his techniques. He smiled, confirming his power’s limits and solidifying his Soul Realm status.

“Yang Huanyu! If you don’t emerge, this old dog dies!” Luo Tian’s voice thundered, shaking the ground.

A seven-colored spiritual energy hand formed, grasping Qi Feiying.

Qi Feiying’s heart jolted at Luo Tian’s call for Yang Huanyu. He glanced at the ground, hope flickering.

Qi Feiying knew Yang Huanyu’s terror; if he joined forces, Luo Tian would surely fall.

But in that moment, Luo Tian’s spiritual hand struck, seizing Qi Feiying, who struggled with blue water-element energy.

“Foolish!” Luo Tian bent his arm, Qi Feiying appearing before him.

“Master Yang! Save me!” Qi Feiying’s face contorted in fear, weakened by his struggle.

The crowd gasped, staring at Luo Tian—his spear in one hand, Qi Feiying floating lifelessly above.

“Don’t you dare emerge? This old dog’s life is forfeit!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed, his gaze icy toward Yang Huanyu.

Seven more!

Chapter 453: Qi Feiying’s Death ()

Chapter 453: Qi Feiying’s Death

Luo Tian gripped Qi Feiying, his gaze cold toward Yang Huanyu. His killing intent materialized, pressing upon the crowd.

Yet they stared at Luo Tian in awe—his spear in one hand, Qi Feiying’s pale face floating above.

“Powerful!” Their minds revered Luo Tian, who had defeated Qi Feiying in under an hour. His might exceeded all expectations.

“Back home, I must retreat to train early for Soul Realm. This power is admirable,” Zheng Xin mused, watching Luo Tian.

“You’re just a talentless brat! How could you compare to Luo Tian?” Duan Yuyan mocked, her voice playful.

“Haha, I can still be mighty! Yuyan, listen—” Zheng Xin smiled, speaking to his jade pendant.

“Seems Bone-Subjugation Stage isn’t enough. You’ve fallen far behind!” Leng Qiuchan’s lips curled, her decision made.

As Luo Tian spoke, all eyes followed his gaze to the cloaked Yang Huanyu.

“Who is he? Why did our elder challenge him?” The thin youth asked Wu Di, confusion in his voice.

“Don’t be foolish! Someone who makes our elder fight must be no ordinary foe,” Wu Di, recovering slightly but pale, scolded the youth.

“Hmph?” Han Lihui and Zhao Hongyi furrowed their brows. They’d met Yang Huanyu before but assumed he was Qi Feiying’s junior.

Now, hearing Luo Tian call him out, they scrutinized the cloaked youth.

Yang Huanyu’s lips curled as he felt all eyes on him. A destructive aura rose from his back.

Two gray wings formed behind him, trembling dust.

In an instant, Yang Huanyu appeared in the sky, his face cold: “Long time no see, Luo Tian. I didn’t think you’d reach Soul Realm so soon. I thought you’d linger in Bone-Subjugation Stage.”

“Soul Realm?” The crowd gasped, stunned.

One Luo Tian was already absurd—twenty years old, Soul Realm mastery, effortlessly subduing another Soul Realm master. Now this cloaked youth, also twenty, was a Soul Realm master. The world felt upside down; some nearly vomited.

Though this youth had only one element, the crowd sensed his danger. His gray spiritual energy made them instinctively fear it.

Luo Tian showed no surprise at Yang Huanyu’s Soul Realm status; he knew Yang Huanyu was the heir of Tianshi Sect. His strength was equal to his own. Reaching Soul Realm was inevitable.

Others, however, marveled at the two youths.

“Master! Save me!” Qi Feiying’s face paled, pleading to Yang Huanyu.

“Waste!” Yang Huanyu sneered, his halberd in hand. He swung it toward Luo Tian.

“Buzz…” Tongming Blood Halberd became a gray line, slicing air with a low hum. It appeared before Luo Tian instantly.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian frowned, seeing the halberd. Though its power was considerable, it couldn’t kill him.

“I’ll see what tricks you have!” Luo Tian’s face showed no fear, his body tensing. His flesh was as strong as a Soul Realm mid-stage.

“Pfth!” A blood spray erupted in the sky.

A body fell, their clash too fast for Bone-Subjugation Stage disciples to perceive. They relied on spiritual awareness, which struggled to keep up.

“Haha! Didn’t think you’d kill your own men!” Luo Tian’s figure appeared in the sky, mocking.

The crowd finally saw who had fallen—Qi Feiying.

“Elder!” Han Lihui and Zhao Hongyi gasped, staring at the falling figure.

“Elder!” The Qi brothers screamed, watching Qi Feiying plummet.

“Explosive!” Yang Huanyu ignored Luo Tian’s mockery, his lips curling.

“Boom…” In the crowd’s shock, Qi Feiying’s body exploded into a mist of blood, scattering to the ground.

All eyes watched this scene, their faces etched with shock. A Soul Realm master’s death hadn’t occurred in Beichang for years. Now, one lay dead at Yang Huanyu’s hands.

“Coward!” The Qi brothers’ eyes turned blood-red. Qi Feiying’s death would cripple the clan, likely pushing them out of the top ten families.

But they dared not retaliate; Yang Huanyu’s terror was known. Without him, Qi Feiying wouldn’t have ascended to Soul Realm so quickly.

“You truly let your men die!” Luo Tian ignored Qi Feiying’s remains. To him, the Qi clan would fall regardless of Yang Huanyu’s interference.

“Waste! He died honorably. To capture you, sacrificing a couple of Soul Realm masters is nothing!” Yang Huanyu spoke coldly, his gaze greedy toward Luo Tian.

“Buzz…” The Chronological Book in Luo Tian’s mind trembled again.

Chapter 454: Elders Arrive ()

Chapter 454: Elders Arrive

“Did you think I was still Bone-Subjugation Stage?” Luo Tian smirked, his spiritual awareness—equivalent to a Cultivation Peak stage—overpowering the trembling Chronological Book.

“The time isn’t right,” Yang Huanyu’s eyes darkened, his halberd returning to hand. He transformed into a meteor, charging toward Luo Tian.

“Haha! No more running?” Luo Tian laughed, his Splitting Heaven Spear roaring. He stepped with the Sealing Heaven Step, thrusting it forward.

They were sworn enemies; neither would let the other live. Their martial arts clashed endlessly.

The sky echoed with explosions, leaving ground-bound onlookers awestruck. Their speed was beyond perception; they only felt the tremors, too afraid to breathe.

Han Lihui and Zhao Hongyi were stunned, unsure whether to attack the remaining Wu Di members.

They’d assumed Yang Huanyu aided Qi clan, but he’d killed Qi Feiying first. Even seasoned leaders were baffled.

The remaining Qi disciples wore sorrow, witnessing their clan’s decline. After this battle, the Qi clan suffered heavy losses—only a third remained, including the weak. True combatants were few. With their Soul Realm elder dead, they were left with Qi Derong (Bone-Subjugation Stage) and three sons at Bone-Subjugation End.

People pitied Qi Derong’s four men, once thriving but now fading.

Yet none noticed that Qi Feiying’s blood mist dissolved into the earth, vanishing entirely.

As people marveled, Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu’s battle reached its peak. Neither could overcome the other; thunderous explosions echoed between them.

“Die!” Luo Tian raised his hands, summoning the Soul-Stealing Seal and Emperor’s Seal. They fused into a Yellow Extreme Seal, radiating imperial authority. It surged toward Yang Huanyu with the might of a mountain.

Now, the Yellow Extreme Seal could unleash grade-B middle-tier power. It covered the sky, glowing golden and blinding.

“Destruction!” Luo Tian moved, launching a Destruction Fist with gray spiritual energy. It struck Yang Huanyu, who was slowed by the seal’s pressure.

“Seal techniques—I know them too! Leave! Destruction? Whether it destroys or not is my choice!” Yang Huanyu roared, his body swirling with gray energy. A seal formed in his hands—featureless but equally powerful as Luo Tian’s.

“Boom!” The clash echoed like thunder, shaking the crowd.

Both men flew backward, their forms reappearing in the sky—though battered.

“Who do you think these people will side with?” Yang Huanyu smirked, gazing at the distance.

Luo Tian’s face darkened, his gaze piercing the horizon. His spiritual awareness detected approaching figures.

Han Lihui and Zhao Hongyi furrowed their brows, puzzled by the sudden halt.

“Swoosh… swoosh…” Then, the sound of breaking air filled their ears. A pressure surged from afar, making them tremble.

“Elders!” Han Lihui and Zhao Hongsheng’s faces lit with joy, gazing at three figures in the sky.

As they called out, ground-bound people stared at the newcomers. They felt the pressure—equal to Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu’s. Few could match this power, save the elders of three families outside Beiming City.

“Huang clan’s people have arrived!” Zhao Hongyi’s face darkened, his gaze cold. He felt the ground tremble as more people approached.

Han Lihui sensed others too—Huang clan’s leader Huang Tianrui, followed by his son Huang Boding.

As Han Lihui and Zhao Hongyi’s sons led large groups from afar, ten breaths later, the three clan elders stood in the sky. Their gazes held surprise as they looked at Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu.

“Respect the elders!” Han Lihui and Zhao Hongyi knelt, bowing to the two white-haired elders.

“Are you Luo Tian?” The elders scrutinized him, their eyes wary yet authoritative.

The third elder looked at Luo Tian with a cryptic expression.
