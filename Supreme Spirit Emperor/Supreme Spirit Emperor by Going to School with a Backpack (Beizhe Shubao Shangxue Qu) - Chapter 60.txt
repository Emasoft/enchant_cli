Luo Tian glanced around, realizing this place was indeed barren. He sensed the surrounding vital energy and discovered it was thin. Standing on this land, Luo Tian felt an odd sensation, as if the earth itself were obscured by something, missing a vital element.

“Where is this?” Seeing the two middle-aged men's hostile gazes, Luo Tian’s eyes turned icy.

Seeing Luo Tian’s cold expression, the two men quickly restrained themselves. Though Luo Tian had washed his face clean, the bloodstained aura still lingered on him. Combined with his formidable presence, it left them puzzled.

“You don’t know where this is?” one of the men asked.

“I don’t!” Luo Tian replied honestly, his confusion deepening.

“You don’t know Beichang County? Then you’re not from the Eastern Region?” The man’s face showed surprise.

Luo Tian recalled how he had fallen from the sky. Legends said only those with great power could traverse the void briefly. Yet seeing Luo Tian’s youthful face, though his appearance was fixed at the Nascent Soul Realm, he still found it hard to believe someone so young could reach such a level. The unique aura of youth on Luo Tian made it impossible for them to imagine him as a master.

“Eastern Region? Beichang County?” Luo Tian muttered the names, his face showing a strange expression.

Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He hadn’t expected to be transported here. The mention of the Eastern Region made him think of Leng Qiuchan, who was supposedly from there. But he didn’t know what Beichang County truly was.

Yet, seeing the initial hostility in the two men’s eyes and their fierce auras, he realized they would strip him bare if they knew he was no match.

“Are you two trying to rob me?” Luo Tian’s lips curled in amusement, directly exposing their intent. His gaze carried a cold edge.

“No! Young master, don’t misunderstand!” One man’s face softened, sensing Luo Tian was likely a first-timer in Beichang County. He guessed Luo Tian wasn’t an easy opponent, so he abandoned the idea of fighting.

“Then goodbye!” Knowing this was the Eastern Region, Luo Tian had no patience for these men. He bowed and strode away.

Watching Luo Tian’s bloodstained back, the silent man asked: “Brother, why didn’t we act? He seems severely injured. If we teamed up…”

“Stop! This kid isn’t as simple as he looks. Young enough to be covered in blood—better avoid trouble!” The man silenced his brother, and the two left without hesitation.

Luo Tian strode along the path, noticing the barrenness here—no cities, no towns. After about half an hour, he extended his spiritual sense and found a stream. He leapt into it to wash the blood off, then retrieved fresh clothes from his storage ring and changed. He pondered what to do next.

“Unexpectedly transported here… returning from the Eastern Region to the Northern, my pace would take ages. I don’t know where the teleportation array is in this Eastern Region. Those two men seemed hardened by years of bloodshed—this Beichang County isn’t a safe place. First priority: heal my wounds. In this unfamiliar Eastern Region, more strength means more security!” Luo Tian mused while extending his spiritual sense again.

He opened his eyes, satisfaction in them. His spiritual sense detected a cave ahead with denser vital energy. Without hesitation, he headed toward it.

“This is an excellent place… there’s even a second-level formation?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed in confusion.

A second-level formation was no challenge for his current strength, but he didn’t want to expend the little recovered vital energy.

He retrieved his Splitting Heaven Spear and unleashed the Bone-Devouring Body’s power, piercing through the formation with one strike. He entered the cave.

Inside, there were daily necessities, though dust-covered—clearly someone had lived here. Luo Tian didn’t care; his priority was healing, and everything else was irrelevant.

He took out a medicinal pill, swallowed it, and sat on a mat, activating the Five Elements Vital Energy Cultivation. He absorbed and restored the energy lost from battles, mending his wounded body.

Three days passed unnoticed. Luo Tian’s injuries had recovered nearly seventy percent. According to his estimate, two more days would complete his recovery—after all, he was a cultivator adept at healing.

Yet Luo Tian found it strange that this cave’s vital energy was far denser than elsewhere. Why had no one come?

After a long sigh, he prepared to resume meditation when his expression shifted. He turned toward the cave’s entrance.

Chapter 294: Get Out!

Chapter 294: Get Out!

At a thousand feet away from the hill, a gaunt middle-aged man in his thirties cautiously scanned the surroundings, moving swiftly.

His cultivation was low—only Body Tempering Stage V. His eyes held a cruel glint. If he met an equal in the Northern Region, he’d likely defeat them.

“Damn luck! I’m lucky to have run fast; otherwise, I’d be dead!” The gaunt man gritted his teeth, heading straight for the cave.

Familiar with the route, he reached a hundred feet outside the cave, carefully checking around. Years of surviving in Beichang County had taught him its residents were ruthless. After confirming no one followed, he strode into the cave’s entrance.

“From now on, I mustn’t enter within a hundred miles of Beiming City—it’s too dangerous! Fortunately, I have a good movement technique. Unlike others at Body Tempering Stage V, who get eaten alive. I’ll stick to the outskirts for cultivation!” The man sighed, recalling his years in Beichang County. He’d seen many die over tiny fragments of vital energy stones. Though numb, he had adapted.

This was Beichang County’s rule: located at the northernmost tip of the Eastern Region, its sparse vital energy and barren land meant few sects stationed here. Yet it wasn’t empty—many desperate cultivators flocked here, unable to survive elsewhere in the Eastern Region. Over time, a fierce faction formed, surviving through sheer brutality. Here, strength dictated everything: vital energy stones, resources, women—all were earned by power. Killing was routine. This explained why two men had tried to ambush Luo Tian upon his arrival.

“Essentially, it’s the lack of vital energy stones and medicinal pills that forces this!” The man muttered, then tossed a formation flag toward the cave’s entrance.

“Still, this cave has denser vital energy than elsewhere—fairly better than most!” The man’s eyes gleamed with pride, relaxing to rest after days of tension.

But soon, his eyes widened. He stared at the iron formation flag he’d planted—its array hadn’t activated.

“Huh? It’s失效?” The gaunt man was stunned, pulling the flag out to inspect the cave entrance. Two clear footprints led inside. He stepped in, but felt no array energy.

If he still didn’t understand, he wouldn’t survive here. His eyes flashed anger: “Who! Daring to occupy my cave? You’re desperate for death! Come out, you bastard!”

The man had his own judgment: though the cave’s vital energy was slightly better than outside, high-level cultivators wouldn’t care. And this cave he’d occupied for years—others had tried to steal it, but most were his equals, whom he killed. Now, he deduced someone had taken advantage of his absence to claim it.

“Damn you! This is my place, Wu Elder’s domain! Who in a hundred miles doesn’t know me? You dare steal it? You’re desperate for death!” The man’s hands moved, a fire dragon erupting from his palms to blast into the cave.

The explosion echoed in the narrow cave. The man shouted again: “Still not out? You bastard…”

His voice trailed off as his heart trembled. He halted, stepping into the cave.

Luo Tian calmly emerged from the cave, eyeing the shouting man.

The man saw it was just Luo Tian, and his youth. His confidence returned, but as he glanced at Luo Tian’s deep eyes, a chill ran through him.

“Ah… young master…” The Wu man stammered, looking at Luo Tian. Though calm, his aura sent a shiver.

“Are you calling me?” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly, looking at the man at Body Tempering Stage V.

“Nothing, nothing! I just… saw guests arriving. A greeting, a connection of fate. If you like this place, stay as long as you wish!” The man’s face paled, forcing a smile while backing away.

At that moment, Luo Tian’s calm gaze fell on the man’s feet. The man froze, unable to move a muscle. Cold sweat dripped down his face, turning paler as if his legs were no longer his own.

Luo Tian’s gaze shifted from the man’s feet to his face. When their eyes met, a sharp sense of danger surged in the man’s heart. Having survived Beichang County for years, he was terrified.

“This person must be at Body Tempering Stage IX… or even stronger than most!” The man had seen up to Body Tempering Stage IX, but this youth felt even more terrifying.

Before Luo Tian could speak, the man fell to his knees: “Pardon me, Master! I spoke out of line earlier!” His body trembled, soaked in sweat.

Luo Tian hesitated—not out of intent to trouble the man, but because this place wasn’t his. He had indeed taken another’s belongings.

Yet Luo Tian’s hesitation was misread by the man, deepening his fear.

“Done!” The man thought of Beichang County’s people—some邪修 and eccentric individuals. A single misstep could lead to murder.

Chapter 295: Is This for Me?

Chapter 295: Is This for Me?

The man’s thoughts grew darker, his mind churning. He felt the worst mistake was returning to this cave—better be chased and escape than face this terrifying youth.

As he thought, the man’s resolve hardened. He wouldn’t die. His mind raced with ideas. Just as Luo Tian raised his head to speak, the man shouted:

“Huh? Is this my cave? Why does it feel so different? Um… I’m sorry, Master. I must’ve taken the wrong place. Forgive me for disturbing your cultivation! Such dense vital energy—how could I, a commoner, live here?” The man’s face bore humility.

His words reached Luo Tian, who paused mid-sentence.

Seeing Luo Tian’s pause, the man perked up, sensing hope. He spoke louder:

“Master, look at this cave! Every item here exudes a subtle Daoic essence. It must be a high-level cultivator’s dwelling, imbued with your aura. This freshness… it makes me reluctant to destroy it! I never imagined, if not for my recklessness, this aura would be so awe-inspiring.” The man rambled, eyes alight as he gazed at the dusty items.

Luo Tian was stunned, watching the man caress a dust-covered bottle like a lover. His face flushed—this was the bottle he’d used for bathroom breaks these days.

The man wondered why the bottle still had water, recalling he hadn’t poured any in. But with his life at stake, he ignored the faint scent.

“I was thinking… perhaps fate led you here! I took a wrong turn, met you—latecomer, I don’t seek anything. Just wish to follow your side, absorb some of your aura. Please grant me this!” The man spoke passionately, hugging the old bottle, his face sincere.

Luo Tian’s scalp prickled. He’d met many people but never one so skilled at flattery. Seeing the man’s antics, Luo Tian couldn’t help laughing.

This laugh made the man rejoice, easing the tense atmosphere in the cave.

“Hope!” The man thought, redoubling his efforts to praise Luo Tian, even complimenting his fingernails.

Hearing the man’s endless flattery, Luo Tian finally couldn’t bear it, his face turning serious: “Alright, I prefer solitude. I know this cave is yours. I won’t take it without paying. Tell me what you need, and I’ll rent it.” Luo Tian interrupted the man’s speech.

The man was drenched in sweat, unsure if from exhaustion or fear. Hearing Luo Tian’s words, his heart finally relaxed. For his life, he felt the effort was worth it. His mouth was dry, but he didn’t care if the bottle’s water was clean or dirty—he gulped it down.

Luo Tian stared in disbelief, his lips twitching. He sighed inwardly: “This Beichang County has such people!”

The man drank a sip of water, relaxed, then noticed an odd smell. His brow furrowed slightly but quickly recovered. He dared not let Luo Tian see his frown.

He wiped his lips, then said: “Forgive me for not introducing myself earlier. I’m Wu Di. Call me Xiao Wu or Xiao Di. Since you like this cave, I won’t ask for anything. Just stay as you wish.”

Luo Tian quickly retreated, fearing the man’s breath would touch him. He sighed inwardly at the name: “Invincible!”

He glanced at Wu Di, thought for a moment, then produced a second-tier medicinal pill.

This pill was one he’d crafted earlier in the Dan Pavilion. With the example of a cave space, Luo Tian now stocked various pills—after all, those in his cave sold for exorbitant prices. Who knew when another such situation would arise?

Feeling one pill wasn’t enough, he reached for another—when a heavy breath echoed.

At that moment, Wu Di’s eyes widened. His breathing quickened, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian’s pill. His body trembled—this time not from fear but pure excitement.

A seemingly inferior pill in Luo Tian’s hand filled the small cave with comforting herbal energy.

“This… is a medicinal pill?” Wu Di’s mouth was dry. If not for fear of Luo Tian, he’d have lunged to grab it.

He hadn’t eaten a pill in years. When he first found this cave, he’d discovered an old pill—compared to Luo Tian’s, it was like heaven and earth.

Beichang County’s resources were scarce; cultivators suffered too. Herbal medicine was hard to grow, and alchemists even rarer. The division was extreme here—those strong had ample pills; those like Wu Di, who’d seen one or none at all.

Usually, cultivation relied on strong cultivators grinding pills into powder and diluting them to sell to the underclass.

“Master! Is this pill for me?” Wu Di swallowed, eyes fixed on Luo Tian’s pill.

Luo Tian was puzzled. He’d just arrived in Beichang County but didn’t know its situation. His eyes flickered: “Yes, a pill—rent your cave for some time. But first, tell me about Beichang County!”

Chapter 296: The Rules of Beichang County

Though Wu Di was only at Body Tempering Stage V, surviving in Beichang County’s lower tiers, he had some local fame. After half an hour of vivid storytelling, Luo Tian understood what Beichang County truly was.

Watching Wu Di leave the cave, clutching Luo Tian’s pill as if afraid he’d change his mind, Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed.

“Unexpectedly cruel here. I must recover my cultivation first, then enter Beiming City to inquire about the teleportation array. Rumors say the Eastern Region’s sects rarely emerge—finding one would be difficult!” Luo Tian sighed, sitting again.

Two days passed unnoticed. Luo Tian’s injuries healed completely under the pill’s nourishment. He opened his eyes, gazing outside the cave with a cold glint. His lips curved slightly, a strange smile.

Outside the cave, Wu Di’s figure looked disheveled, followed by two men in white robes. They rushed to the entrance.

“J-just… at the cave…” Wu Di’s face paled, fear creeping in. He bit his teeth, pointing to the entrance.

“Wu Di… don’t deceive us. You know the consequences!” A young man’s face showed killing intent.

The cave had no door, so they clearly saw Luo Tian seated inside, calm.

Luo Tian sat cross-legged, his coarse robe and determined face gazing at the two outside.

Suddenly, the temperature dropped, as if winter had arrived. The two men shivered.

The young men trembled; this coldness alone made them feel a crisis.

No one spoke. The cave fell silent, with only heavy breathing audible.

Luo Tian stood slowly, his cold gaze directed outside. Each step felt like death approaching them.

In this oppressive atmosphere, one man couldn’t hold back: “This pill… you gave it to him?”

The young man held a pill—Luo Tian’s second-tier one. Wu Di hadn’t eaten it, and the two had taken it from him, tracing back to Luo Tian.

“So what if I did? What if I didn’t?” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly, voice icy.

Suppressing his intense danger sense, he assessed Luo Tian’s cultivation—only Body Tempering Stage IX. He sighed, thinking he’d overreacted. His face returned to arrogance: “Answer my question!”

“If I don’t?” Luo Tian clenched his fists, hearing a crisp sound. He hadn’t fought in a while.

“Then we’ll capture you!” The other young man’s face showed anger.

“Get out…” Luo Tian, after the Northern Region battle, wasn’t against killing—but he knew Beichang County was a place where it was you or me. If they pushed further, he wouldn’t hesitate to leave them here forever.

Wu Di shuddered at Luo Tian’s words. He wasn’t unaware of Luo Tian’s strength, but clearly felt his aura was Body Tempering—though he sensed Luo Tian was much stronger than them. Yet these two were masters outside Beiming City, even those inside feared them. But to Luo Tian, they were told to leave.

Wu Di didn’t know what confidence Luo Tian had to speak like that to two Body Tempering Stage peers.

Luo Tian’s voice used spiritual sense, like a thunderclap in their minds, startling them.

“Die!” They were either angered by Luo Tian’s words or intimidated. Long-standing masters outside Beiming City felt their pride was wounded.

They ignored Wu Di, their Body Tempering Stage IX auras erupted, and they rushed to Luo Tian’s front. A punch and kick with wild energy attacked him.

“Since you’re coming to die, don’t blame me!” Luo Tian sighed. Two Body Tempering Stage IX opponents seemed strong to others, but now he could defeat them even at Bone-Devouring Stage I. After breaking the seal, he might even fight Bone-Devouring Stage II. He didn’t care about these two—his Splitting Heaven Spear was too lazy to use.

“Pound… pound…” The Bone-Devouring Stage’s physical power combined with several times more energy than Body Tempering Stage IX. Two heavy sounds echoed.

In Wu Di’s shock, these two high-level Body Tempering Stage IX masters were like clowns, sent flying by Luo Tian. They collided with the cave wall, making a deafening roar.

The two men fell, eyes wide with shock. They had overestimated Luo Tian but hadn’t expected to be unable to harm him, even with their combined strength. The pain in their chests told them this wasn’t a dream.

Luo Tian ignored their shock, kicked the two men’s chests after sending them flying, collapsing their ribs and twisting their necks—clearly dead.

“This…” Wu Di watched the two men he’d considered invincible die, then looked at Luo Tian’s calm face. He trembled.

“If I’m not mistaken, these two men once chased you! I hate being used!” Luo Tian turned, his eyes flashing killing intent.

“P-please, Master! I… I was wrong!” Wu Di’s face showed terror. In his mind, Luo Tian was definitely a Bone-Devouring Stage I master—no, even Bone-Devouring Stage I couldn’t do this so easily.

“Only once!” Luo Tian’s eyes were cold. He didn’t care about Wu Di’s thoughts; his wounds were nearly healed, and he planned to visit Beiming City for teleportation array info.

“Go, lead the way to Beiming City!” Luo Tian looked at Wu Di.

“B-Beiming City?” Wu Di’s heart lit up, his gaze toward Beiming City, eyes flashing hatred.

Chapter 297: Beiming City

Seeing Wu Di’s hatred, Luo Tian’s eyes flickered. “How come this Beiming City has your enemies?”

“Kneel…!” Wu Di fell to his knees again, fists clenched tightly. His previous sycophantic expression vanished.

“I don’t lie to the Master. I do have enemies in Beiming City…” Wu Di’s face showed hatred, recounting his story.

Wu Di had once been from Beiming City and a minor family there. Though not strong, it wasn’t last place. But like the outside world, Beiming City was a eat-or-be-eaten realm. Wu Di had been a wastrel; in a fight, he’d accidentally killed someone. That wasn’t much—until the victim’s father had ties to one of Beiming City’s top ten masters.

That was a disaster. Wu’s family was wiped out overnight. Wu had been outside, escaping by chance. At the time, he had no strength and was a wastrel; those people hadn’t cared about this failure. They’d expelled him from Beiming City, leaving him to his fate—though in Beichang County, being outside Beiming City was like being near a tiger.

Beiming City had no official ruler, but several families controlled it. Its security was slightly better than outside—still brutal, but no street killings.

But Wu Di had been a lowly Body Tempering Stage II wastrel then. He couldn’t survive outside Beiming City. Fortunately, he’d found this cave and cultivated to Body Tempering Stage IV before leaving.

Hearing Wu Di’s story, Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He pitied Wu Di’s fate but didn’t know Beiming City’s situation, so he couldn’t promise help.

“See the situation. If I can help, I’ll try,” Luo Tian sighed.

“Thank you, Master!” Wu Di knew in Beichang County’s harshness, Luo Tian’s words were a great favor. They’d met by chance; Luo Tian owed him nothing, and Wu Di had even slightly schemed against him. If it were anyone else, they might have killed him for revenge.

“Get up. Lead me into Beiming City to see who’s strong!” Luo Tian sighed, striding out of the cave.

…

Beiming City was the only city in Beichang County, vast in scale. Its internal factions were complex—some could vanish overnight, but a few had stood for years. These major forces ruled Beiming City.

Luo Tian and Wu Di arrived at the city gates after a day’s journey.

Along the way, Luo Tian marveled at Beichang County’s cruelty—killings and thefts were everywhere. The closer to the city gates, the fiercer it was. Many people left through the gates with treasures, so ambushers lurked nearby.

Along the way, they met many attempts to rob them—but all were killed by Luo Tian with a spear or punch.

They fought their way to Beiming City’s gates, where two Body Tempering Stage IX guards stood. Luo Tian was startled—Body Tempering Stage IX in a non-sect city was impressive.

Seeing Luo Tian’s confusion, Wu Di explained: “Beichang County is too chaotic. The major families decided to use Body Tempering Stage IX guards for the gates, preventing trouble.”

Luo Tian nodded. “Let’s go. I guess you haven’t entered Beiming City in a while.”

Wu Di respectfully followed Luo Tian toward the gates.

As they approached, two figures blocked their path, emitting a fierce aura: “Kid, hand over your money. Don’t you know? A lowly Body Tempering Stage IX kid with a Body Tempering Stage V waste—how dare you enter Beiming City? You even made it to the gates?”

Luo Tian saw their fierce aura and frowned. They were about fifty feet from the gate, yet these men dared to rob him openly in front of guards. This made Luo Tian ponder.

“Don’t look! Hand it over quickly, or you’ll lose your life!” One man shouted.

“Get lost…” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate, summoning his Splitting Heaven Spear to pierce their throats.

The golden light startled the city guards, who looked at the two dead men. Their faces showed concern.

The guards were used to these two men, who often bribed them. They’d never failed before—until now, when they were defeated and killed.

Luo Tian ignored the greedy stares at his spear, his eyes scanning those with greed, making them lower their heads. They realized this thin youth wasn’t easy to provoke.

He paid a few vital energy stones for the entry fee and entered Beiming City with Wu Di.

Wu Di gazed at the familiar city, a touch of sorrow on his face—only for a moment. He then began introducing locations to Luo Tian.

They found a teahouse, sat down. Luo Tian knew such places had the most news, though much was useless.

As soon as they sat, Luo Tian listened in. Diverse voices filled his ears.

“Did you hear? The two sons of the Zhou family were killed!”

“In Beichang County, killing isn’t rare. What’s so shocking? Who? The Zhou family’s sons?”

“Hear that Beichang County is selecting a city ruler. Who do you think will be it?”

“Nonsense! Beichang County has existed for years—I’ve never heard of anyone becoming ruler!”

“Hear that the Qi family is holding an auction. Is this true? Everyone in Beiming City knows it—even those outside the city have come.”

Luo Tian listened to the conversations, his face showing interest when he heard about the auction.

Sitting beside him, Wu Di trembled at the mention of Qi family.

Chapter 298: The Qi Family

“How come this Qi family is the one you have a grudge with?” Luo Tian sensed Wu Di’s anger and asked.

“Yes!” The Qi family ranked seventh in Beiming City, powerful—this was the family that slaughtered Wu’s entire clan.

As they spoke, a server brought their food and drinks.

Luo Tian looked at the server, his face serious. He sensed the server’s cultivation and inhaled sharply—this unassuming teahouse server was at Body Tempering Stage VIII.

Noticing Luo Tian’s gaze, the server glanced back. Long-term dealings with Beiming City’s various people made him sense Luo Tian was unusual.

“Guest, you’re unfamiliar—probably not often here?” The server spoke, pouring tea while talking.

“Indeed, first time. Server, I’d like to ask something!” Luo Tian dropped ten vital energy stones into the server’s pocket.

Feeling the faint spiritual energy in his pocket, the server’s eyes brightened. Though he was at Body Tempering Stage VIII, in Beiming City he was the lowest level—without the shop owner’s protection, he’d have been forced out.

Ten vital energy stones weren’t much in Beichang County’s scarcity, but the server was happy to earn extra.

“Guest, please ask. I’ll answer everything! I won’t say I know nothing—about small rumors in Beiming City, if I’m second, no one dares to claim first!” The server smiled confidently.
