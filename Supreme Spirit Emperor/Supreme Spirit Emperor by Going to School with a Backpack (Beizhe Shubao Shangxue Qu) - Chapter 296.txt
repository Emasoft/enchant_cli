“Are you truly an ordinary human, venturing to Qinghe City alone—doesn’t that seem perilous?” Zidian Bird’s eyes flickered with disbelief. Yet, his form transformed into a streak of violet lightning, darting toward Qinghe City.

“Rest easy—without the Realm-Transcending Stage, I am invincible!” Luotian crossed his arms, a self-assured grin spreading across his face.

Zidian Bird’s heart jolted. Though he had guessed Luotian’s strength, he hadn’t anticipated such overwhelming power.

No Realm-Transcending Stage—unparalleled might. Who else would dare utter such words? Only the top-tier prodigies of the Banshen Temple would speak thus.

Half a day passed in an instant. Zidian Bird’s speed was blinding, and Luotian could already glimpse a vast stone city looming in his vision.

Luotian leapt from Zidian Bird’s back, his divine awareness surging toward Qinghe City. The city’s state unfolded within his mind.

Compared to the stone fortress, Qinghe City was far more prosperous, yet still built of stone. Its structures were far more refined, and towering giants roamed its streets.

Luotian extended a hand, golden seals materializing across his body. Simultaneously, his aura vanished into the void. Unless a Realm-Transcending Stage beginner detected him, no one could sense his presence—especially not the flesh-reinforced蛮族.

Luotian swiftly entered Qinghe City, locating its massive governor’s mansion. Its inhabitants materialized within his mind.

He stepped into the mansion, but two giant sentinels remained oblivious to his presence, dozing idly.

“Banshen?” Following the mental images, Luotian quickly found Governor Banshen’s location. Yet, Banshen’s expression was grim.

A burly female giant stood beside him, her stature towering even over Banshen. Luotian was awestruck.

“My son died so pointlessly? You fool—how dare you fail to protect your own flesh and blood!?” A deep roar echoed through the stone hall, shaking it. The woman berated Banshen without mercy.

“Banshen, don’t forget who gave you everything! I can’t stop your infidelities, but if my son dies, I swear I’ll have you skinned and flayed! I’ll go to my father and have him dethrone you, see if you still dare gloat!” The woman ranted without pause. Banshen dared not retort.

“Fierce indeed,” Luotian mused, watching Banshen cower like a whipped dog.

“A mere stone fortress frightened you so? You’ll never rise beyond governor!”

“I pity this Banshen,” Luotian mused, his smile cold.

“No!” Banshen’s face paled at the mention of the Banshen Temple’s arrival. He glared at the woman, halting her rant.

“Why not?” The woman’s gaze sharpened. “You’re hiding something, aren’t you?”

“No!” Banshen lowered his head, frustration seething. For years, Qinghe City knew him as a triumphant governor—but none knew he was a cuckold. His wife, daughter of the Banshen Temple’s Grand Disciple, ruled him with fists and scoldings.

“Let me think… the Southern Ridge Stone Fortress?” The woman’s eyes narrowed, her mind racing.

“Yes—Chu Chen! I remember now! That little scum is in the stone fortress!” Her expression darkened.

“Of course! I’d forgotten that little brat when I purged your children!” She murmured, voice icy.

“I beg you—spare Chu Chen! He’s my only son!” Banshen’s face turned ashen, his voice trembling.

“My only son? Only Banlie is your true heir! Once he dies, you’re finished!” Her voice was frost. She brandished a stone token, transmitting a mental message.

“Crack!” Suddenly, Banshen erupted. His hand smashed the token to splinters.

“No! You may target anyone, but not Chu Chen! For years I’ve obeyed you—this one thing I refuse!” Banshen’s face twitched, his voice thunderous.

“You dare strike me? I’ve already contacted my father. Soon, the Banshen Temple’s strength will arrive, razing that stone fortress to dust! My son died—someone must pay!” The woman ignored the shattered token, bellowing.

“It’s too late to regret! Go and kill that little beast yourself—Qinghe City’s governor remains yours. Otherwise, your fate is sealed!” She struck Banshen across the face with a mighty hand.

A trickle of blood oozed from Banshen’s lips, igniting his fury.

“Your son died—someone must die with you!” A chill swept over Banshen and the woman, making them shiver.

“Who are you? Show yourself!” The woman roared, stomping the ground. An invisible wave radiated outward.

“Hmph, a master—late-stage Sage?” Luotian’s form materialized before them, his gaze amused.

“You!” Banshen stumbled back, stunned by Luotian’s previous might.

“Little one? Are you that human?” The woman recoiled, her gaze wary.

“Yes, it’s me! You didn’t expect that, did you?” Luotian drew his Endless Sword, polishing its blade.

“First blood since I claimed it—though only a late-stage Sage, still commendable!” He murmured, his aura radiating. The woman and Banshen froze.

“I am the daughter of the Banshen Temple’s Third Disciple, Banjingcui. If you kill me, my father will never forgive you!” She declared, knowing she was powerless against Luotian.

“Pfft…” A golden flash erupted. A single sword beam severed Banjingcui’s head, her eyes still burning with defiance.

“Old fool—anyone would do this! If you feared my backing, I wouldn’t have come today!” Luotian sighed, his divine power enveloping her body, erasing her essence.

“What do you intend to do?” Banshen gaped at Banjingcui’s corpse, stunned.

“Go—take the stone fortress and flee. Hope you protect Chu Chen!” Banshen pondered, then spoke softly.

“You go—deliver the message to them, telling them to evacuate. The rest I’ll handle!” Luotian’s gaze burned with battlelust, eager to face the true masters of the蛮族 continent.

“They’re from the Banshen Temple—likely sending a half-Realm-Transcending prodigy or disciple!” Banshen’s eyes widened. He hadn’t expected Luotian to stay and fight.

“Can I run? The fortress needs time to move!” Luotian shook his head. Even if Banshen stayed, he couldn’t stop the Banshen Temple’s strength. Better to stay himself—though even a Realm-Transcending beginner, he had confidence.

“Fine.” Banshen didn’t hesitate. Time was critical; the Banshen Temple’s strength could arrive anytime. If Chu Chen hadn’t evacuated, all would be wasted.

“Go!” Luotian nodded, taking a map of the Southern Ridge from Banshen before vanishing into the hall.

“Sigh…” Banshen sighed, his body aged instantly. His towering form loomed over Qinghe City, eyes heavy with sorrow—this place would never belong to him again.

An hour later, Luotian stood at Qinghe City’s south, seated atop a mountain. The biting wind tousled his hair, and the wild aura of the蛮族 seeped into his senses.

“Admittedly, this蛮族 continent has harsh regions—but some places are breathtaking,” Luotian mused, gazing at the mountain peaks with admiration.

This peak was the key route between蛮荒城 and Qinghe City. No one passing could escape his awareness.

“Use this time to refine the Endless Sword Technique!” Luotian sat cross-legged on a stone, his sword resting between his legs. He closed his eyes, immersing himself in meditation.

“Endless Sword Technique—First Form: The Path Has No Bounds!” His mind fused with the sword, and he began practicing.

Time passed slowly. Three days slipped by unnoticed—save for one visit from Zidian Bird, during which Luotian awoke. For the rest, he remained seated.

Yet, three days transformed him. His aura had changed drastically—his body radiated sword qi, ready to erupt at any moment.

On the fourth day, Luotian opened his eyes, a glint of power in them. He gripped the Endless Sword, its golden light intensifying as divine seals danced around it, emitting a resonant hum.

“Unleash!” Luotian roared, leaping into the sky. He swung his hand, and a golden sword beam shot forth from the Endless Sword, expanding toward the cliff where he had sat.

“Pfft…” A golden thread appeared on the mountain, as if undisturbed.

“Excellent! This is a formidable technique!” Luotian smiled, pushing his hand forward. The mountain split in two, the severed edges smooth enough to reflect sunlight.

As Luotian admired his work, a tremor stirred in his divine awareness—his heart quickened.

“They’ve arrived… later than expected,” he mused, standing in the sky as three massive figures approached.

Three colossal forms emerged within his awareness, strolling through the heavens. Each step cracked the void, radiating chaotic energy.

“Boring—this small Qinghe City required our presence? What’s the governor doing?” A burly giant spoke, his tone impatient.

“Let’s consider it a break. If we capture this human, it’ll be a major achievement. If he reveals the path to Seven Star Island, even greater glory—perhaps earning the Banshen’s blessing!” Another giant mused, his voice lazy.

“Banhong, you speak lightly. Since we received the news to this moment, that human may have already fled!” A young giant scoffed.

“Fine—let’s check first. Destroy the stone fortress, maybe we’ll find clues,” Banhong muttered, frowning.

Chapter 1231: The First Battle of the蛮族

At Qinghe City’s southern peak, Luotian stood, his gaze fierce as he awaited the three蛮族 youths.

“Three young ones?” Luotian frowned, surprised they had sent only three to confront him.

“Their strength is commendable—two at the half-Realm-Transcending Stage, one at the Sage’s peak.” Luotian nodded, admiration in his voice. The young蛮族 were stronger than the Nine Realms’ prodigies.

Unbeknownst to Luotian, these three were legendary within the Banshen Temple—ranked top ten among its prodigies. Their status rivaled that of a city’s ruler, unlike Banshen in the remote Southern Ridge.

If Banshen were here, he’d warn Luotian to be cautious—these three were renowned across the蛮族 continent.

“Let me give you a gift!” Luotian smiled, raising his Endless Sword. A hum resonated as golden sword qi erupted from it, expanding toward the three.

The three giants strolled through the sky, their gazes indifferent—yet at the sword qi’s emergence, they halted abruptly. Their expressions darkened.

In that instant, Luotian’s sword beam struck them, slicing through the void and appearing before their faces.

“Unexpected—someone dares attack us!” One giant’s face turned cold, his fist colliding with the sword beam.

“Boom…” The golden qi shattered upon impact, dispersing into threads of gold before them.

“A martial technique?”

“This technique is intricate—unlike anything the蛮族 employs!” The giant who shattered the beam frowned, observing a white mark on his fingers.

The蛮族 focused on flesh reinforcement; martial techniques were foreign to them, difficult to master. Most, including these three, had abandoned them.

“Banjiang, be cautious—this is a human!” Banhong warned, his tone grave.

“Don’t worry—we’ll handle even Banlidu!” Before Banjiang could respond, another giant interjected, his gaze indifferent.

“Banhai, don’t be careless—perhaps it’s a human trap!” Banjiang’s face hardened, his gaze scanning the horizon as if spotting a glint of gold.

“Understood!” Banhai nodded, slowing their pace.

“Who could it be? That sword’s power was formidable—this human must be a prodigy among humans. If he meets a human genius, it’ll be thrilling! My only regret is never having killed a human genius!” Banhai’s battle spirit flared, his eyes alight.

“Who else would keep humans confined in Seven Star Island? That barrier is annoying. If not for it, our forces might have eradicated them long ago!” Banjiang’s face bore disdain.

As they spoke, the three giants neared Luotian’s mountain peak—only a thousand zhang away. They could now see his golden-clad form.

“One?” Their gazes scanned the area, cautious.

“Don’t look—yes, it’s me alone. I’ve waited for you all!” Luotian moved swiftly, stepping to within five hundred zhang. Though the distance seemed vast, it was trivial for their strength.

“Who are you?” Banjiang asked, disbelief in his eyes as he scanned Luotian’s surroundings.

“Unexpected—truly met a human! His strength isn’t weak. The gods have blessed us!” Banhai’s face lit with joy, gazing at Luotian.

“If it’s you alone, I wonder who gave you the courage to face three of us!” Banhai sneered, his massive foot lunging forward. The sky trembled as he charged, a primordial beast’s might.

“Foolish—daring to approach us so closely!” In a blink, Banhai’s form was upon Luotian, his gust of wind striking Luotian’s face.

“This is the true first battle of the蛮族! Let me see what power your sealed royal bloodline holds!” Luotian felt Banhai’s might, his battle spirit surging. He unleashed the Great Dao Sealing Fist without hesitation, clashing with Banhai’s fist.

“Crack…” A thunderous sound echoed. Both Luotian and Banhai recoiled, their faces grim.

“Hmph!” Banhong and Banjiang’s expressions shifted—never had they encountered a human who could withstand their flesh.

“Not bad, the蛮族’s prodigies. Even I feel strained!” Luotian steadied his breath, no longer underestimating them.

“Who are you? Why isn’t your name in our records?” Banhai asked, astonishment in his voice. His earlier clash had revealed Luotian’s strength—especially the cracks on his arm and the overwhelming Great Dao Power eroding his flesh.

“Fight together—kill me, and you’ll know who I am!” Luotian, no longer holding back,闪身 to Banhai’s front, unleashing the Great Dao Sealing Fist combined with the Heaven-Devouring Attack.

“Banshen Qi!” Banhai roared, his massive right arm swelling with veins, unafraid. He charged at Luotian’s slender form.

“One Strength Overcomes All!” Luotian felt Banhai’s arm radiating destruction, no longer underestimating. He unleashed One Strength Overcomes All.

Two techniques converged—Luotian’s Great Dao Sealing Fist reached its peak, clashing with Banhai’s fist.

“Boom…” A thunderous sound echoed. Two figures retreated a thousand zhang, but this time, Banhai’s entire arm was severed, crashing into a mountain before halting.

Luotian fared slightly better, his arm bearing cracks that healed swiftly.

“How?!” Banhai’s face paled—how could he, a蛮族, lose to a human?

Not only Banhai was stunned; Banhong and Banjiang stared at Luotian’s slender form, unable to fathom how a human’s flesh could be so formidable. It was unprecedented for them.

“Who are you?” Banjiang stepped beside Banhai, his gaze wary. Banhong, a late-stage Sage, was weaker than the two—his involvement was irrelevant.

“Are you the human’s Guanxingjian?” Banjiang noticed Luotian’s golden sword on his back, asking.

“Guanxingjian?” Luotian frowned but dismissed it—evidently, they mistook another for the human’s prodigy.

“Unexpectedly, Guanxingjian has emerged from Seven Star Island!” Banhai’s face lit with excitement. The more he gazed at Luotian, the more convinced he was that this human was Guanxingjian in disguise. Otherwise, how could he be so powerful without Banshen Temple’s records?

“Good—no need to blame me!” Luotian smiled, not refuting. He silently mourned for the human’s prodigy.

“Confirmed!” Seeing Luotian’s silence, Banjiang and Banhai grew more certain of their suspicions.

“Long have I wished to test your might, Guanxingjian! Today’s encounter proves your reputation!” Banhai’s battle spirit flared.

“Wonder what reward we’ll receive for capturing you,” Banjiang mused, his blood boiling. They planned to subdue Luotian and return him to蛮荒城.

“Hah! You dream too much!” Luotian闪身, becoming a golden streak as he attacked again.

“Don’t hold back—face the first human prodigy!” Banhai and Banjiang exchanged glances, their bodies roaring as if something within them awoke.

“Banshen’s Wrath!” Their deep voices echoed, their bodies radiating light, complex seals swirling around them.

Under the sunlight, they glowed golden, their eyes turning blood-red as they locked onto Luotian’s form.

“Flesh-reinforcement technique?” Luotian frowned, halting his advance as he observed their golden forms.

Chapter 1232: The Seven Steps of the蛮族

Below the sky, two golden figures surged forward, their bodies radiating overwhelming power. They resembled molten gold, charging toward Luotian with an unstoppable might that shook his soul.

Luotian felt the danger, their flesh-reinforced might capable of crushing all—unstoppable.

As he pondered, Banjiang and Banhai’s forms appeared before him. They didn’t strike immediately; their flesh was their weapon.

“Boom!” Luotian’s fist collided with Banjiang, leaving him pale and his arm cracked. Blood spewed from his mouth.

Luotian felt as if he’d struck iron, his shock profound. This was the first time he had lost in a flesh battle—though they fought together, it still stunned him.

Not only was Luotian shocked; Banhai and Banjiang were equally awestruck. They hadn’t expected a human to withstand their combined might. Even a half-Realm-Transcending or early Realm-Transcending蛮族 would have fallen.

“Cough… cough…” Luotian spat blood, finally acknowledging Banjiang and Banhai.

“Indeed, the human’s first prodigy—Guanxingjian!” Banjiang sighed, his battle spirit fierce. Yet his massive form charged again, swirling winds in its wake.

“Draw your sword—face our flesh-reinforced might! You’re overestimating yourself!” Banhai sneered.

“Technique? I have one too,” Luotian’s battle spirit remained undimmed. A surge of black mist erupted from his body, turning the sky dark.

“Demon Cultivation!” Luotian roared, absorbing the ink-black mist into his body. His dantian reversed, and black demonic energy swirled around him.

“Demon Cultivation boosts my Sage power slightly, but it enhances my flesh significantly! I’ll see if your蛮族 flesh is stronger than my reincarnation body!” Luotian’s mind scoffed, charging toward Banjiang and Banhai like a demon king.

“Kill!” Banhai and Banjiang’s battle spirits flared, their bodies roaring as they collided with Luotian again.

“Boom…” The clash echoed. This time, Luotian wasn’t as helpless.

“Again!” A默契 formed between the three—colliding with primal force, their clash shaking the heavens and collapsing mountains.

The collision site saw entire ranges crumble, its thunderous sound echoing across the Southern Ridge. All蛮族 giants in the region trembled with fear.

“Who’s fighting?” In Qinghe City, countless giants gazed southward at the annihilated sky. They could hear the clash’s thunder, as if the world had ended.

“Is it you? Luotian!” In the Southern Ridge Stone Fortress, Chu Chen carried a massive stone pot, walking with the fortress’s people to find their new refuge.

“Go—don’t worry. His choice must have a way out,” Banshen sighed, watching Chu Chen.

“Hmph!” Chu Chen glanced at Banshen but ignored him, scoffing and following Shizhangshan.

“Misfortune runs deep,” Banshen’s face bore bitterness, gazing at the hatred in the fortress’s eyes. His heart ached.

The clash continued—Luotian repeatedly collided with Banjiang and Banhai, their bodies unevenly matched. Blood splattered everywhere.

After half an hour of combat, all three were riddled with cracks and bleeding profusely.

Luotian felt his flesh was no longer his—his soul and body were shattered, pain overwhelming. His face turned ashen.

Banhai and Banjiang fared no better—massive bones exposed, their eyes wide with shock.

“This is the human’s first prodigy—unmatched!” Banhong, a mile away, marveled.

“Hah! A thrilling fight!” Banhai laughed, but blood spewed from his mouth uncontrollably. His body trembled as if about to collapse.

“Respect—unquestionably, you are the strongest human we’ve met! Your reputation is well-earned!” Banjiang praised. The蛮族 revered strength; Luotian’s flesh battle had earned their respect.

“But we must still capture you. Capturing alive is impossible—now, we’ll unleash our final strike. Be prepared!” Banhai and Banjiang warned Luotian, their bodies roaring again.

“Foolish蛮族!” Luotian shook his head, surprised they were so straightforward.

“Fine—I’ll accept it!” Luotian nodded, his voice grave as his aura coalesced.

“Don’t worry—should you survive, we’ll plead for your life at the Banshen Temple. You’ll live,” Banhai declared, his thick finger pressing a blood droplet into his forehead.

Banjiang did the same—his crimson blood marked his brow. Afterward, their bodies swelled again.

“Banshen’s Wrath—Seven Steps!” They roared, their massive shadows emerging behind them. The shadows took their forms, becoming tangible—wild energy radiated from them, as if the Banshen himself had descended. Blood-red eyes glowed, scanning the heavens.

“Is it the Seven Steps of the蛮族?” Banhong’s face lit with excitement, watching Banjiang and Banhai’s colossal shadows. They loomed like mountains, oppressive and awe-inspiring.

“They’ve mastered the Seven Steps!” Banhong gasped, disbelief in his voice.

“Has the Banshen himself descended?” The massive shadows, visible even from Qinghe City, caused many ordinary蛮族 giants to kneel, gazing at the godlike figures.

“Ah! I see now—they’re the Banshen Temple’s prodigies, Banjiang and Banhai!” Someone recognized them, excitement in their eyes.

“Why have they come to our Southern Ridge? Who could fight both prodigies?” People’s eyes held confusion, guessing who could face two of the strongest.

“Hum…” Black magic blades凝聚 in Luotian’s hand. He knew if he continued with flesh battles, he’d be crushed.

Two golden feet, radiating immense pressure, stomped toward him—overwhelming enough to crush all. The skies fractured as the feet swept forward, storming toward Luotian.

“Powerful!” Luotian felt a chill, admiring the Seven Steps’ might while his black magic blade erupted. The seventh strike slashed forth, merging with the Heaven-Devouring Attack—fivefold power, a black crescent moon slicing toward the golden feet.

In an instant, the massive blade collided with their feet. The sky darkened instantly, black magic filling it and obscuring Banhong’s view.

“Banshen’s Second Step—Shatter the Stars!” Banjiang’s voice echoed through the black magic. Golden light dispersed it, revealing their battlefield.

The scene showed Banhai’s form restored, while Banjiang remained as a colossal figure, his foot stomping toward Luotian in the sky.

“Even better than before!” Banhong’s heart trembled, watching Banjiang’s might.

“Still weaker than my brother!” Banhai stood behind Banjiang, sighing as he gazed at his brother’s overwhelming might.

“But that Guanxingjian is truly strong—he withstood our first step!” Banhai murmured, admiration in his eyes.

“Truly strong,” Luotian mused, gazing at the golden feet that could crush stars.

“Endless Sword!” Luotian extended his hand, and the Endless Sword materialized.

“Path Has No Bounds!” He swung it, golden sword qi rising from his hand. Great Dao Power merged with the Endless Sword, as did the Heaven-Devouring Attack.

“Draw your sword!” Seeing Luotian finally draw his blade, Banhai’s heart sank. The Banshen Temple had records of Guanxingjian—once drawn, he was at his peak. His sword would cut through all enemies, earning him the title of human’s first prodigy.

The sword sang, golden qi erupting. Its sharpness could cut through everything, making Banhai and Banhong’s hearts leap into their throats.
