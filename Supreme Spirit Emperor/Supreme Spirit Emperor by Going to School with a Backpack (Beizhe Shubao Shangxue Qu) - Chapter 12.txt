“Hmph! With so many senior and junior disciples here, all witnessing that Qi Daolin intends to assault a direct disciple. Senior and junior disciples, please bear witness! I Luo Tian am standing here today—dare you strike?” Luo Tian gazed at Qi Daolin with a cold gaze, radiating an overwhelming aura of authority.

“Shameless!” echoed in the minds of all present. Everyone here knew that an inner sect disciple assaulting a direct disciple violated the sect’s rules; if someone witnessed it and did not intervene, they would be equally guilty! They had merely come to watch the spectacle, but Luo Tian’s words dragged them into the fray—clearly, he was making these onlookers shield him from Qi Daolin.

When Qi Daolin heard Luo Tian’s words, his lost rationality gradually returned. Gazing at the lofty and indifferent Luo Tian, Qi Daolin clenched his teeth tightly, his eyes bloodshot as he stared at Luo Tian.

Dong Sansi gazed at Luo Tian with admiration in his eyes: “Indeed, the first-place candidate of the assessment. Just for this courage, I am far inferior!”

Dong Sansi had no idea that Luo Tian, seeing Qi Daolin’s red eyes, felt he had overplayed his role and inwardly trembled: “Big brother, don’t act rashly! Don’t act rashly!”

Chapter Fifty-Two: Humiliation

Qi Daolin’s eyes burned crimson as he stared at Luo Tian, who stood motionless. His hands trembled as he raised them again. He knew that if he lightly struck, the dazzling talent of the Five Elements Sect would be gravely injured; if he pressed harder, Luo Tian would die.

“Senior Qi, it’s unwise! He is a direct disciple of the Elder Master!” voices of admonition arose.

Everyone watched Qi Daolin anxiously, fearing that a single impulse would leave Luo Tian crushed here. Some with high cultivation had already subtly moved to Luo Tian’s side, preparing to intervene at any moment.

Human nature is such: the more you advise someone, the more they stubbornly cling to their thoughts. Qi Daolin was no exception; hearing repeated calls of “direct disciple” and pleas, he felt that if he did not strike today, he would have no face to remain in the Pill Hall.

“Even if I die!” Qi Daolin roared, his red palm fiercely descending upon Luo Tian’s head.

When Luo Tian heard the admonitions and saw Qi Daolin’s increasingly crimson eyes, he realized trouble. He secretly infused golden-element energy into his legs, preparing to flee. Though he had spoken of dying courageously earlier, Luo Tian was no fool—he would not risk his life.

Seeing Qi Daolin’s palm descend, Luo Tian’s legs had already prepared to leap, vanishing from the spot.

“Boom!” A thunderous sound echoed, sending shockwaves of energy that toppled nearby tables and chairs.

Several figures fell to the ground, their faces innocent as they gazed at Luo Tian’s escape. Their minds roiled with a thousand curses: “You said you’d die courageously! Why did you run? If you were going to flee, at least say something so I wouldn’t have come to block it for you!”

Luo Tian, seeing the few who had shielded Qi Daolin’s strike, flashed a flicker of guilt: “Thank you all for your assistance. You are all good people, true disciples of the Five Elements Sect!”

“Go to hell! I just came here for a medicinal herb! What did we do to deserve this!” Though the few had blocked Qi Daolin’s attack, his cultivation level of Body Refinement Nine was enough to shake them. Had it not been for face, they would have spat blood.

Yet upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, they默契ly spat blood—never before had they encountered such shameless person.

“Why are you all here?” A furious voice echoed as Lu Kunpeng arrived with Lin Zhengyang, entering the Medicinal Herb Hall. He surveyed the ruined scene and glared at the gathered disciples.

Upon hearing Lu Kunpeng’s voice, Qi Daolin instantly regained his senses, regretting his impulsive actions. He hurried to Lu Kunpeng’s side and knelt in reverence.

“Respect the Grand Elder!” As Qi Daolin bowed, others followed suit, leaving only Luo Tian standing alone.

Lu Kunpeng’s gaze fell upon Luo Tian in the corner, and his anger flared: “You’ve mastered the Thousand Pages Brushing Hands? Come to the Medicinal Herb Hall to cause trouble?”

Hearing Lu Kunpeng’s harsh words, Luo Tian also knelt: “It is roughly complete. I came to collect some medicinal herbs for testing. Unexpectedly, I met Senior Qi and…”

“Then what? Stuttering!” Lu Kunpeng, upon hearing Luo Tian had mastered the Thousand Pages Brushing Hands, clearly disbelieved it. Not only did he not know the method, but even if he did, he doubted that Luo Tian could master it in just seven days.

“Just a minor issue during the herb collection!” Luo Tian quickly replied.

“Hmph! Daolin, explain what happened!” Lu Kunpeng ignored Luo Tian and coldly glared at Qi Daolin.

“This… this!” Qi Daolin was torn, unsure how to explain. How could he say that Luo Tian had angered him and he wanted to strike him down?

“Hmph! You’re stammering too! Tell me, what happened!” Lu Kunpeng clearly was angry and pointed at a disciple.

“Ah… this is how it happened…” The disciple, under Lu Kunpeng’s increasingly cold gaze, recounted the entire incident.

“Good! Good! Good!” Lu Kunpeng said three times, but everyone knew he was furious. The temperature in the entire Medicinal Herb Hall seemed to drop.

“Good, both of you have truly grown up!” Lu Kunpeng’s disappointed gaze swept over Qi Daolin and Luo Tian.

Upon feeling Lu Kunpeng’s gaze, Qi Daolin broke out in cold sweat and fell to his knees.

“Qi Daolin! You are over thirty, yet still quarrel with a young upstart. How shameless! I had planned to take you as my disciple after the Pill Competition. You… have truly disappointed me! With such a temperament, how can you manage the Medicinal Herb Hall!” Lu Kunpeng’s words shook Qi Daolin.

Since entering the Pill Hall, Qi Daolin had dreamed of joining Lu Kunpeng’s sect. He admired Lu Kunpeng’s devotion to the art of pills, just as he himself did. If it weren’t for his obsession with the art of pills, he would not have reached his current cultivation.

Qi Daolin never imagined that a single clash with Luo Tian would shatter his dream. His eyes dimmed.

Seeing Qi Daolin’s expression, Lu Kunpeng knew what he was thinking. He had always favored Qi Daolin, seeing in him a reflection of his younger self—devoted to the art of pills without hesitation. But Qi Daolin’s temperament was too extreme; if someone insulted the art of pills, he treated them as his father’s killer.

Lu Kunpeng sighed softly and continued: “Go to the Wanyao Cliff for fifteen days of facing the wall. After fifteen days, I will assess your performance in the Pill Competition. If you remain in this state, then you and I are no longer connected!”

Though Qi Daolin had lost hope, upon hearing Lu Kunpeng’s words, his eyes brightened. “Disciple obeys!”

The others, hearing Lu Kunpeng’s punishment for Qi Daolin, shuddered. They recalled that frigid place—the Wanyao Cliff. Even those at Body Refinement would feel the chill. They had never expected Lu Kunpeng’s punishment to be so severe.

They instinctively glanced at Luo Tian, who had previously offended Lu Kunpeng, wondering how he would be punished. Surely it would be harsher!

Lu Kunpeng glanced at Luo Tian, who stood respectfully. He coldly snorted: “Arrogant and disrespectful! You will have your herbs halved. If you borrow again, repay with double the pills!”

Hearing Lu Kunpeng’s punishment for Luo Tian, none understood why. Luo Tian merely smiled bitterly; he had only come to collect herbs and now faced a half-reduction. Yet, as Lu Kunpeng was the Grand Elder, he had treated him kindly. He accepted it reluctantly.

As people were astonished, Lu Kunpeng’s voice rang out again: “Of course, our previous agreement still stands. If you do not use the Thousand Pages Brushing Hands during the Pill Competition, then you may leave the Pill Hall!”

Hearing Lu Kunpeng’s words, people inhaled sharply. They were also stunned by his arrogance—Five Elements Body! He could expel someone from the Pill Hall with a single word.

Chapter Fifty-Three: Alchemy

“Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed from Luo Tian’s courtyard.

It had been seven days since Luo Tian returned from the Medicinal Herb Hall. During these seven days, such thunderous sounds had frequently echoed.

Alchemy was no trivial matter. Luo Tian had known since arriving in Tianyuan City that the hardships of an alchemist—whether controlling fire, refining herbs, or any slight mistake could result in ruined elixirs or even a shattered furnace. Worse still, injuries were possible.

During these seven days, this was the seventeenth furnace Luo Tian had exploded. Now clad in the blue robe of a Pill Hall disciple, his eyes bore a look of regret.

“This alchemist’s profession is truly costly! The furnace is only part of it; the cost of herbs used in alchemy is even more expensive!” Luo Tian sighed.

Previously, in Tianyuan City, since the Gu family provided herbs, he hadn’t paid much attention. Now it was his own burden; he finally understood why Gu Yun had wanted to kill him.

These days, Luo Tian had been using alchemy to master the Thousand Pages Brushing Hands. The number of herbs he had destroyed was countless, and these elixirs were inevitably borrowed from the Medicinal Herb Hall.

“Sixty percent of plant energy! I doubt there are many in the entire Pill Hall who can achieve this!” Luo Tian toyed with his refined body elixir, a look of satisfaction on his face. He marveled at the power of the Thousand Pages Brushing Hands.

“Luo Tian, I’ve brought you a furnace!” Dong Sansi’s voice echoed as his frail body stood outside Luo Tian’s courtyard. Seeing Luo Tian proudly holding the elixir, he was puzzled why Luo Tian took such pride in a refined body elixir.

Seeing Dong Sansi arrive, Luo Tian sighed: “How much do I owe?”

Dong Sansi smiled bitterly: “Not much. Including today, it’s one thousand three hundred and fifty-eight refined body elixirs! But remember the Grand Elder’s punishment—double that, two thousand seven hundred and sixteen! Of course, if you can refine a higher-grade elixir, it’s another matter!”

Hearing Dong Sansi mention the Grand Elder’s punishment, Luo Tian slapped his forehead, his face showing bitterness. He hadn’t realized the punishment was so extreme.

“You’re not the one with the most debt. Someone owes over eight thousand elixirs; they’ll have to refine for nearly thirty years!” Dong Sansi encouraged Luo Tian.

Hearing this number, Luo Tian was stunned, then sighed bitterly and handed two jade bottles to Dong Sansi. He felt gratitude toward Dong Sansi, who had垫付 for him these past two days when he hadn’t succeeded in refining. This was his first submission of elixirs, containing five refined body elixirs.

Dong Sansi smiled bitterly as he took the bottles but quickly said: “Encourage yourself. When the Pill Competition comes, let them shut up. I heard Qi Daolin is in self-reflection at Wanyao Cliff. He hasn’t been defeated but has even advanced to a fourth-grade alchemist, vowing to defeat you in the competition!”

Luo Tian didn’t take Dong Sansi’s words seriously. He watched him leave, his eyes thoughtful: “This can’t go on! I must find a way. But with my alchemy skills, no one from other sects will come to me for elixirs. I’ll owe more and more!”

As an alchemist, the most important thing is being requested to refine elixirs. Only then can one hone their alchemical skills and achieve greater recognition, as the herbs are not borrowed from the sect but used with payment.

As for deductions, it had become a rule among alchemists—this even other sects couldn’t say much about.

“This matter should be left to Dong Sansi to think of a solution. The immediate priority is to master the Thousand Pages Brushing Hands!” Luo Tian sighed, sending a mental message to Dong Sansi through his jade token.

The Pill Token, a unique jade token of the Five Elements Sect’s Pill Hall, differed from other sects’ tokens. The Pill Hall token allows long-distance communication with fellow disciples via mental energy, though the distance depends on one’s mental strength.

Dong Sansi delivered the refined body elixirs to the Medicinal Herb Hall and received Luo Tian’s mental message. His face showed a bitter smile as he left the hall.

……

After Qi Daolin was punished to Wanyao Cliff, the Medicinal Herb Hall was temporarily managed by an elder named Zhang Wenyuan.

Zhang Wenyuan was old, his alchemical skills limited but his position secured through age. Lu Kunpeng had allowed him to temporarily replace Qi Daolin due to his hardship.

At this moment, Zhang Wenyuan picked up the elixirs collected that day and gently sniffed them before placing them in another jade bottle. A young apprentice was responsible for recording.

Having spent so long in the Medicinal Herb Hall and being an alchemist, Zhang Wenyuan could judge the elixir’s quality by just a sniff.

“These alchemists’ refined body elixirs are all similar, no difference. But they’re young people…” Zhang Wenyuan sighed and picked up another jade bottle, uncorking it without sniffing first. He took a sip of tea before slowly bringing it to his nose.

But after sniffing, Zhang Wenyuan was stunned. He lowered his head and sniffed again, his eyes filled with shock. He poured out five refined body elixirs into his palm and carefully examined them again, his expression finally changing.

“Sixty percent of plant energy!” Zhang Wenyuan’s eyes showed shock, disbelief as he gazed at the refined body elixirs.

“Only a shame it’s a refined body elixir. If it were a higher-grade one…” Zhang Wenyuan’s breath quickened, his eyes flashing before he rushed out of the door.

Luo Tian naturally didn’t know about these five refined body elixirs. At this moment, he was excitedly watching Dong Sansi bring a young disciple from the Golden Light Sect!

This disciple, Du Hongyu, was a prodigy at Body Refinement Nine, wearing the golden attire of the Golden Light Sect. His face bore a long scar from top to bottom, making him look fierce.

“You are the Five Elements Body Luo Tian? You can refine elixirs?” Du Hongyu frowned, speaking coldly. In his view, alchemists were older, and he had never thought a young person could be an alchemist.

Luo Tian frowned, standing coldly. He knew the demeanor of an alchemist—being cold made others respect you; being too low-key made people think you lacked ability.

Thus, Luo Tian flicked his sleeve and coldly said: “Hmph! Dong Sansi, don’t involve me next time!”

After saying this, he didn’t even glance at Du Hongyu and turned to leave.

Dong Sansi had spent a long time with Luo Tian and knew the temperament of alchemists. He understood Luo Tian’s meaning, praising him inwardly while showing a reproachful look at Du Hongyu.

Chapter Fifty-Four: Refined Body Elixir

“Hmph! Du Hongyu, I know your cultivation is high and you look down on others. But think—nowadays, who would want to refine elixirs for a third-grade alchemist!”

Dong Sansi coldly said to Du Hongyu.

Hearing Dong Sansi’s words, Du Hongyu’s eyes darkened. In the past years, due to his youth, he had offended many alchemists. As for fourth-grade and above alchemists, he couldn’t afford them. He had turned his gaze to these new disciples of the Pill Hall, hoping one or two would be third-grade alchemists.

Thinking this, he smiled apologetically: “I was rude earlier. I didn’t know Luo Dan Shi is not only a prodigy in cultivation but also a genius in alchemy. I admire you!”

“Hmph, what elixir do you want to refine?” Luo Tian, hearing Du Hongyu’s words, stopped and coldly asked.

“Refined Body Elixir!” Du Hongyu’s eyes flashed, seeing Luo Tian had spoken directly. He bit his teeth and answered.

Luo Tian heard “Refined Body Elixir!” and his mind tensed, recalling the records of this elixir.

“Refined Body Elixir,” a third-grade elixir, taken by those at Body Refinement Nine to increase the chance of advancing to Bone Refinement. The exact percentage depends on the plant energy within the elixir.

“How many percent of success rate do you want?” Luo Tian spoke softly.

“Percent?” Du Hongyu was confused by Luo Tian’s question. Could the percentage be controlled? He looked at Luo Tian with curiosity.

“One percent of herbs for one percent, two percent for two, increase by double for each additional percent. I can refine up to seven percent. Prepare the herbs yourself, and pay five ten thousand yuan stones! When you’re ready, bring them to Dong Sansi. Then come back in three days for the elixir!” Luo Tian spoke calmly, his eyes confident.

“Hiss…” Du Hongyu hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so extraordinary. Seven percent! Ordinary people would find it amazing to refine four or five percent. Yet Luo Tian could achieve seven percent—what kind of monster was this? His cultivation talent was terrifying, but his alchemy talent was even more so!

Dong Sansi also looked at Luo Tian with admiration. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to refine such concentrated plant energy elixirs. His mind already envisioned the entire Five Elements Sect’s disciples fighting for one of Luo Tian’s elixirs.

Du Hongyu’s eyes showed admiration, speaking lowly: “Please wait for me two days. Once I’ve prepared the herbs, I’ll send them to Brother Dong!”

Luo Tian nodded and, with Dong Sansi, headed toward the Pill Hall.

Watching Luo Tian leave, Du Hongyu’s eyes showed contemplation before he bit his teeth: “I’ll trust you once. If you play any tricks, I Du Hongyu won’t let it slide!”

At this moment, Zhang Wenyuan arrived at the register of collected elixirs. He looked through the records and saw that the bottle of refined body elixir only had a “Luo” character.

“Among the entire Pill Hall’s eight thousand inner disciples, there are about twenty with the surname Luo. Among recent new disciples, five. Thus, the one who refined this elixir must be among these five!” Zhang Wenyuan looked at the names of the five and felt excitement.

“If it’s truly among these five, soon he will become famous in the Pill Hall. Then we’ll know which Luo youth it is.” Zhang Wenyuan muttered to himself.

Three days later, Du Hongyu arrived with the required herbs and yuan stones to Dong Sansi’s hands. He was extremely polite toward Dong Sansi, as he too was a disciple of the Pill Hall and had a good relationship with Luo Tian.

“Please excuse me! If I can break through this time, tell Luo Dan Shi that Du Hongyu owes him a favor!” Du Hongyu earnestly handed the storage bag of herbs to Dong Sansi.

Dong Sansi carefully took the storage bag and nodded, sighing inwardly at how powerful alchemists were. They could earn materials and yuan stones, even make others owe them favors. Unfortunately, he was still an entry-level alchemist and sighed before heading to Luo Tian’s small courtyard.

Luo Tian saw Dong Sansi arrive and smiled, knowing Du Hongyu had sent the herbs. He was finally opening his business.

Dong Sansi handed him the storage bag: “I’ve checked it, and everything is fine!”

Luo Tian nodded slightly and took the herbs from the storage bag. As for the five ten thousand yuan stones, he didn’t touch them but handed them to Dong Sansi: “Keep these. You’ll need them when you go on a journey later!”

Seeing Luo Tian give him five ten thousand yuan stones, Dong Sansi quickly refused. Five ten thousand yuan stones were not many but not few—equivalent to the price of a lower-grade yellow-tier martial arts technique. But for Dong Sansi, who came from an ordinary background, it was still a lot.

“Now, yuan stones are useless to me!” Luo Tian spoke softly.

Though the Pill Hall’s yuan stones could be used for purchases, they were extremely expensive. The Five Elements Sect commonly used contribution points instead—refining elixirs in the Pill Hall could be exchanged for contribution points, and other sects had their own methods of obtaining contribution points.

Dong Sansi took the five ten thousand yuan stones with gratitude, knowing Luo Tian wouldn’t reclaim them. If he needed yuan stones later, he could return them.

“Next, I’ll refine the Refined Body Elixir. You can watch from the side; it will help you learn alchemy!” Luo Tian spoke again.

This statement made Dong Sansi even more grateful. Usually, alchemists wouldn’t let others watch unless they were extremely trusted. Otherwise, a slight mistake could ruin the elixir or even allow an attack during refinement.

Because alchemists focused entirely on their work, they were the best times for ambushes.

“Alright, I’ll start refining!” It was his first business deal, and the elixir had seven percent of plant energy. Luo Tian’s expression was cautious because he had only successfully achieved six percent a few times before.

Dong Sansi stood at the courtyard’s entrance, fearing someone would suddenly enter and disturb Luo Tian.

Luo Tian took a deep breath, took out the furnace, placed one hand on the fire mouth and continuously threw herbs into the cauldron with the other. His speed increased, using the Thousand Pages Brushing Hands technique.

Dong Sansi watched in awe, his eyes filled with admiration. Luo Tian’s speed was astonishing—watching him, it seemed like multiple hands were moving up and down. Dong Sansi marveled endlessly.

A wave of herbal fragrance drifted out, and Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with light as he whispered: “Condense!”

Luo Tian removed the flame, used both hands to slam the furnace’s lid open, and quickly placed several black elixirs into a jade bottle.

He took the elixirs, smelled them gently, and smiled: “Sixty percent of plant energy. It looks good, but it’s still far from seven percent!”

After saying this, Luo Tian, under Dong Sansi’s astonished gaze, placed his hand back on the fire mouth.

Chapter Fifty-Five: Du Hongyu’s Breakthrough

“Boom…” The thunderous sound returned after a day.

Luo Tian wore a serious expression, growling: “Seventy percent of plant energy! Condense!”

The explosion echoed within the furnace. Dong Sansi was excitedly watching Luo Tian’s alchemy process, his heart shaking. Luo Tian’s alchemy technique was too mysterious; he only saw Luo Tian’s hands and the furnace moving constantly, leaving afterimages. Then came the fragrance of condensed herbs.

“Is this the Luo Tian people mocked? If he’s unsuitable for alchemy, who else has the right?” Dong Sansi thought of those who had mocked Luo Tian in the Medicinal Herb Hall. If they saw Luo Tian’s alchemy process, what expression would they have?

“Pang!” Luo Tian slammed the furnace’s lid again. Several dark, round elixirs emitted a radiant glow and flew into his hands.

“Fourteen herbs refined successfully one furnace of sixty percent plant energy, another of seventy percent. If I refine sixty percent, the success rate would increase significantly. It seems in the future, I can’t refine seventy percent without a high price; the success rate is too low and the herbs earned are few!” Luo Tian sighed.

Dong Sansi approached Luo Tian, looking at him with admiration. Though he felt Luo Tian had succeeded, he still asked: “Did it succeed?”

“Hmph!” Luo Tian smiled slightly and placed three elixirs into a jade bottle, sealed it, and handed it to Dong Sansi.

“One for Du Hongyu, one you keep for yourself. When you break through to Bone Refinement, use it. The last one, you can sell or give away as you wish—your choice!” Luo Tian spoke softly. He sealed the remaining three into a jade bottle and placed them in his storage bag.

“This!” Dong Sansi was completely stunned. Luo Tian’s generosity was too great. Du Hongyu had used half his savings to get the herbs for Luo Tian to refine, yet he received two elixirs. The one who provided the materials only got one! Dong Sansi didn’t know if Du Hongyu would go crazy upon learning the result.

“Take it and keep it. Later, you’ll need to help me connect with those who come for alchemy. I’m sure people will come soon. Then you’ll be busy!” Luo Tian smiled, his face confident.

Seeing Luo Tian say this, Dong Sansi didn’t hesitate and took the elixirs, leaving Luo Tian’s small courtyard.

Luo Tian watched Dong Sansi leave and muttered: “Du Hongyu, Du Hongyu. I hope you’re not so useless! With seventy percent of plant energy, if you still can’t break through to Bone Refinement, you might as well hit a wall!”

After saying this, Luo Tian turned and walked into his house.

……

At this moment, Du Hongyu was excitedly holding the black elixir in his hand. Though he had heard Luo Tian’s assurance that it could refine seventy percent of plant energy, he still felt uncertain. He wasn’t very familiar with alchemy.

Du Hongyu’s face was complex as he gazed at the elixir, his eyes showing a hint of cruelty: “No matter what, this is definitely a Refined Body Elixir. If it truly has seventy percent of plant energy, I’ll be grateful to you. If not, no matter how much of a genius you are, after eating my things, I’ll make you pay back in full!”

Without hesitation, Du Hongyu swallowed the elixir. Immediately, his mind exploded with a thunderous sound, and his body trembled. His internal energy surged like a tsunami.

Time passed slowly. Two days later, on the second day’s dusk, Du Hongyu’s body trembled. He suddenly opened his eyes and, in the moment he did so, a pre-Bone Refinement aura radiated from his body. His eyes showed excitement, and his body trembled as he stood up to confirm his cultivation level.

His laughter echoed across the four directions, immediately drawing attention from other disciples of the Golden Light Sect. Soon, everyone felt a shock.

“Du Hongyu has broken through to Bone Refinement!”

“He had been stuck at Body Refinement Nine for two years. Now he’s broken through!” Murmurs echoed across the Golden Light Sect.

Du Hongyu’s breakthrough caused a major stir in the Golden Light Sect. Once one becomes Bone Refinement, they can become disciples of inner sect elders. After some time and evaluation, they may even become inner sect elders.

If that were all, the Golden Light Sect disciples would have focused their attention on Du Hongyu. But Dong Sansi, who had been watching Du Hongyu closely, immediately sent the news of how Luo Tian refined the elixir to others.

This way, Luo Tian’s name spread rapidly through Du Hongyu’s breakthrough. The most important thing for an alchemist is fame; with fame, people will come to ask him to refine elixirs.

For this matter, Du Hongyu, who had already felt gratitude toward Luo Tian, didn’t hesitate and decided to let Luo Tian use his influence. When disciples from the Golden Light Sect asked, Du Hongyu would openly say it was Luo Tian’s elixir that had helped him break through.

This made Luo Tian’s name gain popularity in the Golden Light Sect. No one expected that Luo Tian, besides his astonishing talent, also had an incredible alchemy talent.

However, most disciples had their own familiar alchemists and were hesitant to switch. Even if Du Hongyu had broken through, most people remained doubtful.

This news reached Zhang Wenyuan’s ears in the Medicinal Herb Hall. Upon hearing it, his eyes flashed with light. A few days ago, he had been waiting for the one who refined the Refined Body Elixir to become famous. Unexpectedly, it had happened in just a few days. He guessed there was a seventy percent chance the alchemist was Luo Tian.

Thus, Zhang Wenyuan immediately left the inner quarters of the Medicinal Herb Hall and found Dong Sansi, asking him to introduce Luo Tian for alchemy.

Luo Tian naturally knew about the news of his fame spreading. As his reputation grew, he had been waiting for people to come and ask him to refine elixirs. But after three days, no one had arrived. This made Luo Tian frown.

At this moment, hearing Dong Sansi say that Zhang Wenyuan had asked him to refine elixirs, Luo Tian’s spirit lifted. He immediately agreed.

Three days later, Zhang Wenyuan received the elixirs he needed and returned to his room. He carefully observed them, his eyes increasingly excited.

“Sixty percent of plant energy! Such an elixir can only be refined by a fourth-grade alchemist. Third-grade alchemists cannot refine it!” Zhang Wenyuan whispered to himself. At this moment, he was certain that Luo Tian was the one he sought!

Zhang Wenyuan didn’t hesitate and swallowed the elixir. After several hours, he suddenly opened his eyes, his eyes filled with excitement. Having been stuck at Body Refinement for over seven years, he had finally broken through to Bone Refinement!

Chapter Fifty-Six: Fame Rekindled

Zhang Wenyuan’s face was filled with excitement. He had been stuck at Body Refinement for years, becoming a laughingstock in the Five Elements Sect. Though he outwardly didn’t care, being mocked for nearly seven years had left him feeling uncomfortable.

“This boy will surely become one of the top alchemists. But his fame isn’t yet great. I can help him now and build a relationship for the future!” Zhang Wenyuan’s thoughts were similar to Du Hongyu’s, but even more extreme. After all, he was a Pill Hall disciple and far more skilled in alchemy than Du Hongyu.

Another wave of excitement arose, this time from Zhang Wenyuan. Having been stuck at Body Refinement for seven years, his breakthrough had drawn the attention of outer sect disciples from all peaks.

Every time Zhang Wenyuan spoke with others, he mentioned Luo Tian’s elixirs and even compared the Refined Body Elixir to other alchemists’ elixirs.

With Du Hongyu and Zhang Wenyuan, the news spread rapidly—Luo Tian’s name re-entered people’s sights after the entrance exam, this time due to his alchemy skills.

At this moment, disciples from the Golden Light Sect who had heard of Luo Tian’s name hesitated but decided to try. They found Dong Sansi and asked him to recommend Luo Tian for alchemy.

Luo Tian naturally accepted all requests without hesitation, even if the demands were absurd. This疯狂 approach eventually led to his first batch of elixirs being refined.

When this first group of disciples received the elixirs and returned to their caves that night, a thunderous sound echoed from the Golden Light Sect’s outer sect.

The next day, several figures rushed out of the Golden Light Sect toward Luo Tian’s courtyard.

“Did you hear? The Pill Hall’s Luo Tian can refine elixirs with sixty percent of plant energy!”

“How is that possible? Though I’m not familiar with alchemy, I know that only fourth-grade or higher alchemists can refine elixirs with over fifty percent of plant energy!”

“Is it true? Just test it and you’ll know!” This kind of talk spread throughout the Five Elements Sect.

At this moment, Dong Sansi was the busiest person. Every moment, disciples from various sects came to find him.

After all, the Pill Hall couldn’t allow so many people to enter at once. Thus, most sought out Dong Sansi outside the Pill Hall.

More and more people came to find Dong Sansi, not only did he become overwhelmed but Luo Tian also became exhausted. He was constantly refining elixirs, gradually unable to bear it. With the massive amount of alchemy, his skills rapidly improved and he acquired many herbs, even some strange elixirs.

As the situation escalated, especially after ten days of persistence, all Pill Hall alchemists had become annoyed with Luo Tian. He realized this and discussed it with Dong Sansi, deciding to refine only three furnaces daily and set prices so high they were absurd.

This method calmed the other alchemists’ anger, but even so, people rushed to find Dong Sansi daily.

Wanyao Cliff, a frigid place where the Five Elements Sect punished disciples. A man in his thirties, with a wild look, stood out of place: “Luo Tian, wait! Even if you are a prodigy, I will defeat you in the alchemy competition!”

In the Pill Hall’s inner sect, Lu Kunpeng sat on a chair, holding a black elixir in his hand. His eyes were thoughtful: “Did he really master it? Had I wronged him?”

“You never stop causing trouble!” On Qingmu Peak, Gu Qiansnow held the elixir Luo Tian had given him. His eyes flashed with a touch of tenderness, which was noticed by a white-cloaked youth nearby. He looked puzzled and then left.

On the Poison Peak, Gu Lei carefully watched his cauldron: “Luo Tian, you truly are my brother! Your fame has become even more renowned! I must also work harder!”

“Hmph, you’re sneaking to refine elixirs again! Get back to the poison pool!” Wu Ping’an’s furious voice echoed as he rushed to Gu Lei’s side, lifting him and throwing him into a nearby black pool.

“Ah! Old bastard! When I’m stronger, I’ll make you drink this every day!” Gu Lei cried out helplessly as he was thrown into the black pool.

Thus, Luo Tian’s elixirs became popular throughout the Five Elements Sect. His name was soon known across all peaks, becoming a topic of discussion.

That day, Meng Hao wiped sweat from his forehead: “Finally finished! Just three furnaces left today. Fortunately, my cultivation has increased significantly. Let me try to break through Body Refinement Seven after this!”

Luo Tian looked at the table full of jade bottles and sighed. These days, he hadn’t rested at all, constantly refining the elixirs he had previously owed. Today, he finally completed them all.

Luo Tian sighed in relief and wandered around the Pill Hall’s mountain peaks. A noisy sound reached his ears, and he heard Dong Sansi’s voice. He walked toward the direction it came from.

After rounding a pond, Luo Tian saw a square with dozens of young disciples sitting, their faces filled with arrogance.
