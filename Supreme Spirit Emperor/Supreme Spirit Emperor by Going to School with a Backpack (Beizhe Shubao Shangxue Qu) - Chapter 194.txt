“Nothing significant. Whoever becomes the Sect Leader of Tongtian Sect is fine with me. I know how much I can eat. When Ma Tongsun was alive, I couldn’t be the Sect Leader. Even after he’s gone, it’s not my turn to become the Sect Leader!” Song Yongkang smiled, his gaze turning toward Luo Tian. The meaning was clear: if you can become the Sect Leader, I Song Yongkang will naturally support you.

With Song Yongkang’s example, those who had previously been filled with indignation suddenly regained their clarity. Their gazes turned toward Luo Tian, who had even slain Ma Tongsun. How could he be so easy to deal with? For their own lives, it was better not to interfere. Compared to avenging a deceased Sect Leader, their own lives were more important.

“I also wish to surrender…” countless voices echoed, as they all broke away from Niu Hongyun’s side and stood behind Song Yongkang.

“Song Yongkang…” Niu Hongyun gritted his teeth, glaring at Song Yongkang with hatred. He longed to devour him alive. With Song Yongkang’s words, Niu Hongyun’s forces had dwindled to over two million, most of whom were Ma Tongsun’s clan members. They knew that in the ruthless world of cultivators, surrender was impossible. Who would allow their enemies’ descendants to command them?

Though Song Yongkang seemed indifferent, it was like removing the fire from under Niu Hongyun’s feet, reducing his strength to its lowest.

“Enough. Have you finished discussing? If so, prepare to die!” Luo Tian seemed impatient, his face dark with killing intent. He gazed at the nearly two million people before him and coldly spoke.

“Song Yongkang, today I’ll kill this kid first, then settle accounts with you!” Niu Hongyun’s face twisted with ferocity and madness. The allure of the Sect Leader position had driven him to fight desperately.

“Two million Zunzhi-level cultivators. I don’t believe we can’t kill one Superficial-level being! Form the Heaven-Opening Array!” Niu Hongyun barked at his two million disciples.

His words were law. As soon as Niu Hongyun spoke, the two million Zunzhi-level disciples let out low roars.

“Kill…” A terrifying killing intent surged,凝聚 into an invisible storm that swept toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian stood calmly, unmoved by the two million Zunzhi-level killing intents. Back then, when he was a Superficial-level cultivator, it might have been daunting. But now, Luo Tian’s power was unparalleled. He stood at the storm’s center, a faint smirk on his face.

“Go…” Thunder cracked, divine voices echoed. Luo Tian opened his mouth, like a celestial god standing at the storm’s center. His long hair fluttered as he coldly sneered, and the violent killing intent shattered instantly into a breeze that stirred his robes.

“Tongtian Array, one array to reach the heavens!” Niu Hongyun ignored Luo Tian’s single sneer that dispersed their killing intent. He shouted again, his hands moving rapidly. Nine-colored Dao origins slowly emerged from his palms, soaring into the sky.

“Indeed, a Tongtian Sect elder. You possess seven Dao origins!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with light, his gaze fixed on the nine origins in the sky. He admitted that if they were of equal rank, he might not have been able to defeat Niu Hongyun.

At the same time, the two million Tongtian Sect disciples behind Niu Hongyun also moved their hands rapidly. Their bodies shimmered with light, and multicolored Dao origins凝聚 into the sky.

“Buzz…” The Dao origins intertwined, gradually merging until they formed staircases that stretched toward the heavens. A terrifying pressure instantly enveloped Luo Tian.

“Senior Master Song, can this young man withstand the Tongtian Array? If he fails, won’t it let Niu Hongyun establish authority among the Tongtian Sect disciples? Then in the future…” an elder with seven Dao origins asked softly, gazing at the sky’s Tongtian Thunder.

As a member of the Tongtian Sect, they all knew the array’s power. Once, two Superficial-level masters had come to cause trouble, thinking they could dominate the sect. But one was killed by Ma Tongsun using a borrowed sacred artifact from Shanshai Sect, and the other was slain by the Tongtian Array.

“Rest assured. This young man isn’t someone who would back down easily. He’s the one who killed Ma Tongsun! Even if he is eventually slain by the Tongtian Array, Niu Hongyun will suffer. A nine Dao origin cultivator thinking he can control the Tongtian Sect is pure fantasy. Not only that, but even sects with Superficial-level masters would not sit idly by. How could they let such a juicy prize be devoured by a mere nine Dao origin?” Song Yongkang’s face bore anticipation as he gazed at Luo Tian.

At that moment, he hoped Luo Tian would win. With a cultivator who could kill Superficial-level masters guarding the Tongtian Sect, it would fear no sects except the three major Dao sects.

Luo Tian, however, was unaware of Song Yongkang’s thoughts. He knew that to subdue the Tongtian Sect, he needed震慑 (intimidation), using blood to intimidate. These two million people were the perfect tools for his intimidation.

As he gazed at the massive Tongtian Land in the sky, his eyes flickered. He could sense that this colossal land possessed power to crush Superficial-level masters. This made Luo Tian slightly wary.

“Crush!” Cold words echoed like heavenly authority from Niu Hongyun’s mouth. The massive Tongtian Land, as if under the will of heaven, roared forward, crushing toward Luo Tian.

A heavy and ancient aura made people feel suffocated. Even Luo Tian was no exception. His body shimmered with golden light, like a celestial war god. He stared intently at the crushing Tongtian Land, his eyes burning with battle intent.

“One day, I will defy heaven!” The eight characters etched on the Tongtian Sect’s mountain echoed in Luo Tian’s mind. A surge of heroism erupted from his body.

“Though I cannot defy heaven, this array imbued with heavenly will—I can break it!” Luo Tian’s hands moved rapidly. The King Seal… the Soul-Stealing Seal…

One by one, great seals emerged from his hands, merging into a golden seal that appeared before the onlookers. A violent fluctuation radiated from the golden seal.

“Five Seals United, Crush Heaven!” Luo Tian roared, launching the golden seal. This technique was inspired by the *Book of Epochs* from the封神大陆 (Feng Shen Continent), where a single page of golden scripture had crushed heaven. It was the perfect technique to shatter this array imbued with heavenly will.

“Buzz…” The golden seal shattered the void, like a rising sun, slowly flying toward the descending Tongtian Land.

“What technique is this? Why do I feel it’s no less than the one formed by the Tongtian Array, and even seems to have a countermeasure against it!” Song Yongkang’s face was filled with shock. It was the first time he had seen a technique that could counter the Tongtian Array.

As they spoke, the golden seal collided with the Tongtian Land with a deafening roar. The golden seal seemed to declare its sovereignty, its golden inscriptions flowing across it, radiating a mighty aura that smashed into the ancient land.

“Crack…” A thunderous sound echoed, as if heaven itself had been pierced. In a flash of lightning and fire, the gray Tongtian Land was shattered by the golden seal. It transformed into waves of Dao origins, forming a terrifying storm that spread outward.

Blood spewed from mouths as the array was broken. Two million Tongtian Sect disciples spat blood, their faces pale. They gazed at the golden seal that could crush everything, their eyes flickering with despair.

“How? How could the Tongtian Road, which can kill Superficial-level masters, fail to kill you, this young Superficial?” Niu Hongyun’s eyes were filled with disbelief. His gaze was lifeless, repeating “impossible” over and over.

“Superficial-level? I kill Superficials like slaughtering chickens!” Luo Tian sneered, raising his white hand and swiping it. The golden seal shattered the heavenly array and rushed toward Niu Hongyun and his group.

“Flee!” At that moment, Luo Tian appeared to them as a legendary war god, like a deity. Even the array imbued with heavenly will had been shattered. Seeing the golden seal flying toward them, no one dared to resist. They shouted for escape.

But in the next instant, a terrifying pressure froze them in place. Not even a single step could be taken; their eyes were filled with fear.

The terrifying pressure crushed even some Zunzhi-level cultivators before the seal had landed, killing them instantly.

“Ah! I surrender!” One person could not withstand the pressure and roared, eyes filled with entreaty as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“Too late…” Luo Tian smiled sinisterly and smashed the seal down into the crowd.

Blood mist spread, blood splattered forth. In this single strike, tens of thousands of Tongtian Sect disciples, including Niu Hongyun, were annihilated.

Song Yongkang watched Luo Tian with a cold expression, his face showing trembling. He secretly thanked himself for not being blinded by greed.

Chapter 883: Are You the Epoch Master?

Within the Tongtian Sect, the sky above was like a human hell. Luo Tian’s face bore cold killing intent, as if a human meat grinder, rushing into the crowd. He killed like slaughtering chickens, harvesting those who had previously attacked him.

Blood spilled in waves, dyeing the mountain of Tongtian red, leaving people stunned. Corpses fell from the sky, torn apart by Luo Tian and thrown into the void.

Long Jie and Wang Xuanyang had already sensed the thundering sounds within Tongtian Continent. Seeing corpses being transported out, they knew Luo Tian was safe. These Zunzhi-level masters could not match Luo Tian.

At that moment, Wang Xuanyang’s respect for Luo Tian grew even more. The sight of so many corpses was truly shocking.

Within the Tongtian Continent, Song Yongkang and others felt the same. Once a war god, now he seemed like a devil from hell.

“Decisive in killing and subduing, this young man—if he doesn’t die early—may lead the Tongtian Sect to grow stronger, even surpassing the three major Dao sects!” Song Yongkang spoke solemnly, his voice filled with admiration.

Hearing Song Yongkang’s high praise for Luo Tian, the Tongtian Sect disciples looked surprised. They had never expected Song Yongkang to hold such high regard for Luo Tian.

Time passed slowly, and the entire Tongtian Sect seemed painted in red. A thick scent of blood invaded people’s minds.

After killing the last Tongtian Sect disciple, Luo Tian was drenched in blood qi. He grinned, revealing his white teeth.

“Alright, now let’s discuss the issue of the Tongtian Sect’s Sect Leader!” Luo Tian waved his hand, teleporting Long Jie and Wang Xuanyang into the view of the Tongtian Sect disciples.

“Tongtian Sect disciples, pay homage to your Sect Leader!” Song Yongkang led the disciples in a respectful bow toward Luo Tian.

“Haha, you’ve bowed to the wrong person. From now on, this Sect’s master is him!” Luo Tian pointed at Wang Xuanyang, an eight Dao origin Celestial Sovereign.

“Rumors spread…” The Tongtian Sect disciples were stunned, unsure of Luo Tian’s intentions.

An eight Dao origin Celestial Sovereign as the Sect Leader? Such a claim would be hard to believe.

“Ah…” Wang Xuanyang’s face showed tension. This was his first time seeing so many people gazing at him, and his legs trembled involuntarily. He stood there, unsure of what to do.

Luo Tian sighed inwardly. Wang Xuanyang was an independent cultivator, unaccustomed to such a scene. Though he trembled slightly, it was still commendable. If an ordinary person were in this situation, they might have collapsed.

“None of you should be surprised. If anyone disagrees, speak up!” Luo Tian’s gaze swept over Song Yongkang and the other eight or nine Dao origin elders.

“Pay homage to your Sect Leader!” Though reluctant, Song Yongkang bowed slightly toward Wang Xuanyang.

With Song Yongkang’s example, others also showed respect, gazing at Wang Xuanyang and bowing.

Seeing so many people bow to him, Wang Xuanyang felt as if he were dreaming. He never imagined himself becoming the Sect Leader of the Tongtian Sect, one of the top sects in Fire Domain.

“Alright, you’ll surely feel uneasy. Senior Master Song, please guide Wang Xiong to familiarize himself with the Tongtian Sect and adapt to this position!”

“Of course. I know Wang Xiong’s current strength is hard to command the disciples, but for now, I won’t leave. With me here, you should have no worries. Even if I go, I’ll ensure Wang Xiong reaches Superficial-level!” Luo Tian smiled, pointing a finger. A golden inscription flew into Song Yongkang’s body.

Song Yongkang didn’t resist. He knew Luo Tian could kill him effortlessly, leaving no chance for resistance.

The golden inscription entered Song Yongkang’s mind, causing his spirit to tremble. His face flashed with joy, gazing at Luo Tian with deep gratitude.

The inscription was the Superficial Insight, allowing Song Yongkang to break free from his nine Dao origin limit. How could he not be excited?

Luo Tian naturally knew that after intimidation, it was time to offer benefits. He understood the principle of giving a slap and then a sweet apple.

“Please rest assured, I will assist Wang Sect Leader well!” Song Yongkang expressed his loyalty with gratitude.

“Alright, go about your duties. Give me the Tongtian Sect’s records—detailed as possible!” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the eight characters on Tongtian Peak with interest.

After instructing everyone, Luo Tian and Long Jie flew to the massive body of Tongtian Mountain. His gaze fell on the eight characters.

“Brother, these eight characters are no simple matter. They aren’t newly carved; they’ve been there for countless years. The ancient aura they emit is terrifying,” Long Jie said, his youthful face showing concern. Instinctively, he felt that Tongtian Mountain was not as it seemed.

Luo Tian naturally knew the mountain’s significance. The previous intense fluctuations hadn’t harmed it at all. He even suspected that a Saint-level master was sealed beneath the mountain.

“What’s wrong?” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with purple light, gazing at the eight characters. He sought clues but found only that they were written by a Saint and possessed immense power.

At that moment, a Tongtian Sect disciple handed Luo Tian a jade slip respectfully. After reading it, his eyes lit up.

“Why is that terrifying youth staring at the mountain? Does he find something strange about those eight characters?” The disciples looked puzzled, unaware of Luo Tian’s name.

“I’ve found it!” Luo Tian’s face showed excitement. He sighed inwardly, realizing he had stumbled upon a treasure.

“Gu Tianshu! A Saint-level master who, for unknown reasons, was sealed beneath Tongtian Mountain. He eventually perished due to time and became a corpse here!” Luo Tian’s mind recalled the legendary history of the Tongtian Sect.

“Yet, the sect has never discovered Gu Tianshu’s inheritance. They only knew those eight characters were extraordinary, with every Sect Leader attempting to grasp their meaning and ascend to Saint-level!” Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with admiration, gazing at the eight characters. The more he looked, the more he felt they possessed unique Dao rhythms. Especially with his current cultivation, staring too long made him dizzy—a sensation that shouldn’t exist for a half-Saint.

“What hidden mysteries do they hold?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, hovering before the mountain wall. His entire body exuded an ethereal aura, entering a state of unity with heaven and man to comprehend how those eight characters could lead one to Saint-level.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian seemed lost in another world, sitting cross-legged in the sky. His vast spiritual awareness swept over the wall, not missing any detail.

As time passed, Luo Tian’s head ached more and more. Sweat flowed down his face until he was forcibly pulled out of the unity state.

During Luo Tian’s meditation, Long Jie observed him closely. He felt Luo Tian radiated like a blazing sun, illuminating the entire sky. A comforting holy power touched Long Jie’s body.

Luo Tian opened his eyes in confusion, though he hadn’t grasped anything from the unity state. He wasn’t discouraged and planned to try again.

But as soon as he opened his eyes, a string of dense characters appeared in his mind, making his face show joy.

“Refining essence into qi… refining qi into spirit… refining spirit into void… refining void into saint…” Luo Tian whispered, but after a few lines, it stopped. This made him slightly angry.

However, he noticed his changes. After meditating for nearly an hour, though his head ached, his mind had clearly expanded. The *Book of Epochs* floating in his mind also glowed with a soft light, leaving Luo Tian stunned.

“What’s happening? Why is the *Book of Epochs* reacting? Did something stimulate the great sage within it?” Luo Tian wondered, gazing at the mountain wall again. Since no incident occurred during his first meditation, he felt reassured.

He smoothly entered the unity state again but was suddenly met with a deep voice: “You… are the Epoch Master?”

The沧桑 (ancient) voice seemed to cross time, entering Luo Tian’s ears. He shivered and broke out of the unity state, his eyes filled with fear as he gazed at the mountain wall.

Chapter 884: Gu Tianshu

“Are you the Epoch Master?” The deep voice instantly made Luo Tian feel as if cold water had been poured over him, trembling. He hadn’t expected the Tongtian Sect to truly harbor a terrifying presence.

“What is an Epoch Master?” Luo Tian wondered, but he dared not move. Who knew if the entity had ill intentions? If so, how would he deal with it?

“Go down. He won’t harm you. The two of you have some connection!” Just as Luo Tian was trembling, another ancient voice echoed in his mind. This made him jump high.

“Damn it! Who’s this now!” Luo Tian cursed, making Long Jie look surprised. He didn’t understand why Luo Tian was suddenly cursing.

“Don’t worry, don’t worry!” Luo Tian gave Long Jie a reassuring glance and didn’t want him to worry. He smiled, but his heart drummed. His mind’s perception revealed a golden old man’s figure.

“Respect the elder!” Luo Tian regained his composure, his voice filled with respect as he sent it into his mind. He knew this figure was likely a terrifying presence. The great sage who had once saved his life from the Saint-level master in the Netherworld, he couldn’t help but be respectful.

Though Luo Tian had countless questions to ask, he didn’t know how to start. He waited for the old man’s figure to speak.

“Alright, I can’t stay long. The two times I helped you against Elder Nine were too exhausting. I’ve recovered a bit, so I’m here to tell you: go meet the person below! I can sense he has some fate connection with you and won’t harm you!”

“Also, each of the nine domains has a page of the *Book of Epochs*. You’ve already obtained the one from Four Sacred Star Domains. There are still eight pages left. No matter what means you use, obtain them! Don’t let the Netherworld get them; otherwise, it will be troublesome!” The old man spoke slowly and then his body gradually faded away, returning to the *Book of Epochs*.

Hearing the old man’s words, Luo Tian showed confusion. He was even more concerned about what connection this person under the mountain had with him and what secrets remained in the eight pages of the *Book of Epochs*.

But Luo Tian instinctively felt this old man wouldn’t harm him. After all, if he had wanted his life, he would have already died.

After instructing Long Jie, Luo Tian transformed into a streak of light and plunged into the mountain’s depths. In an instant, he appeared ten thousand zhang below.

His powerful spiritual awareness spread out. He felt the surrounding darkness and scanned nearly thirty thousand zhang before discovering an open space, as if formed out of nowhere in the dense land. The space was tightly sealed by countless inscriptions, leaving Luo Tian stunned.

“Buzz…” Having made his decision, Luo Tian didn’t hesitate and moved through the ground, appearing outside the space.

“This…” In his view, the open space was narrower than the place of the elder in Hu Lao Star. It could barely fit three or four people.

Inside the space, a withered old man with lifeless eyes appeared before Luo Tian. He even thought this old man was no match for him.

“You… are the Epoch Master?” The old man didn’t speak, but his ancient and weak voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind. This made Luo Tian startled.

“Elder, I don’t know who the Epoch Master is. But I am definitely not!” Luo Tian guessed the old man might be referring to his *Book of Epochs*, but he didn’t admit it.

This old man looked like a dying person, but Luo Tian knew such an ancient being must have astonishing abilities. Even with his current strength, he had no confidence against a Saint-level master.

“You are the Epoch Master. I sensed the aura of the *Book of Epochs* on you. Don’t hide it. Also, I sensed a fate connection between you and my descendants. Are you acquainted with the Gu family?” The old man spoke weakly, each sentence requiring a long pause.

“The Gu family?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He only knew the Gu family’s descendants—Gu Yun and Gu Qianxue. But he had seen their clan records, which mentioned an ancestor named Gu Changqing, not Gu Tianshu.

Upon thinking of this, Luo Tian’s breath quickened. He stared at the old man who looked like a mummy, his eyes wide.

“Elder, do you know an ancestor named Gu Changqing?” Luo Tian asked hesitantly, his voice filled with respect toward the mummy-like old man.

“Gu Changqing… Gu Changqing… Heh, I think I once had that name. But later I changed it to Gu Tianshu!” The mummy spoke, as if lost in memories. His lifeless eyes showed a hint of nostalgia, as if recalling for a long time.

“Gu Changqing… My heavens! I’ve seen the ancestor of the Gu family here!” Luo Tian’s heart pounded uncontrollably. He never expected to find a living ancestor of the Gu family.

Luo Tian’s shock was beyond measure. This old man was definitely a living fossil, having lived for countless years.

“Elder… if you are Gu Changqing, I do know your descendant…” Luo Tian bowed respectfully. No matter what, he was now the son-in-law of the Gu family. Bowing to a patriarch was no overstep.

“Haha, I know. Since you are my Gu family’s descendant, I’m at ease! Tell me about the current state of the Gu family. How many Superficial-level masters are there? Do they still dominate Fire Domain?” Gu Changqing paused and continued.

Luo Tian felt a shock upon hearing Gu Changqing’s words. He thought of the Gu family’s decline, nearly wiped out by a single Yuanling-level master. To dominate Fire Domain?

But he couldn’t say that. He recounted the Gu family’s current state, carefully watching Gu Changqing.

The old man had lived for millions of years. Luo Tian’s hesitation made him realize the Gu family wasn’t in good shape. His eyes flashed with gold light, gazing at Luo Tian: “Tell the truth. As long as they aren’t wiped out, it’s not a problem!”

Luo Tian was struck by lightning. His face broke into cold sweat as he recounted the Gu family’s history to Gu Changqing, carefully watching him.

When Gu Changqing heard that a mere Yuanling-level master had nearly wiped out the Gu family, his withered body trembled. His entire body radiated a fierce light, and the space changed as if a volcano was about to erupt.

But eventually, it calmed down. His body became even more withered, and the single outburst had cost him much energy.

“Regardless, it’s good they survived! Since you are my Gu family’s son-in-law, kneel down and call me your ancestor!” Knowing Luo Tian was his daughter’s husband, Gu Changqing softened. His voice carried a gentle tone.

“Respect your ancestor!” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate, his heart already certain that this withered old man was the Gu family’s ancestor, Gu Changqing.

At the same time, Luo Tian felt deep confusion. Why had such a great sage chosen to shrink in this small place? Why hadn’t he cared about his descendants’ decline, even leaving Fire Domain and crossing into the Four Sacred Star Domains without a word?

Luo Tian could imagine how glorious the Gu family must have been with such a sage. But it had declined, falling from the clouds gradually until it nearly faced annihilation through generations.

“Haha, are you curious why I’m here and not caring about the family’s fate?” Gu Changqing’s voice was still intermittent, as if ready to vanish at any moment.

Before Luo Tian could answer, Gu Changqing turned around slowly, revealing his withered back.

His back shimmered with golden light, a character of guilt radiating terrifying fluctuations and glistening gold. It covered Gu Changqing’s withered back.

“This is all past history. Remember, even if you eventually reach the Saint-level, don’t be careless. There are always higher realms beyond heaven and people beyond humans. Unless you become the legendary Epoch Master, mastering this era, you will ultimately fall to heaven’s will!” Gu Changqing’s bitter voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

“Heaven’s will!” Upon hearing the words, Luo Tian immediately thought of the eight characters outside Tongtian Mountain—bold and defiant against heaven. It was likely written by this Gu Changqing.

“My time is short. I will pass on my two most cherished treasures to you. Hope you can bring them back to the Gu family!” Gu Changqing didn’t waste words with Luo Tian. His voice carried a gentle tone.

His withered fingers extended slowly, grasping the air. Luo Tian’s body appeared in the narrow space.

“My life’s first pride is my Dan technique. I was the first Saint-level alchemist in Fire Domain!”

“My second is the Fanta Killing Technique. Mastering this allows you to be invincible at your level. I once relied on this technique to dominate Fire Domain’s talents, ascend to Saint-level, and become the domain’s master. But I ultimately fell to heaven’s will, changing my name to Gu Tianshu. I was sealed beneath Tongtian Mountain and branded a traitor, forever unable to rise!” Gu Changqing’s voice carried pride, leaving Luo Tian in awe.

Chapter 885: All Sides Stirred

Beneath Tongtian Mountain, Luo Tian remained solemn as he absorbed the vast information Gu Changqing passed into his mind. His face showed excitement.

“The Fanta Killing Technique enhances combat power to an extreme level, boosting one’s strength!”

“As for the Dan technique, I can only imprint my insights onto you. How much you grasp depends entirely on your own!” Gu Changqing’s weak voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, bringing him back to reality.

At that moment, Gu Changqing’s aura was at its weakest. He seemed almost dead, making Luo Tian uncomfortable.

“Elder, how can I save you?” Luo Tian’s face showed sincerity as he gazed at Gu Changqing’s back, where the golden guilt character glowed.

“You can’t save me. Unless you reach the Epoch level and combine my Fanta Killing Technique to break this space, I can escape. But even then, it’s only escape—no strength remains. However, I won’t live long enough for that. Within two years, my time will end!” Gu Changqing’s voice carried a hint of relief.

Luo Tian accepted Gu Changqing’s inheritance and realized how extraordinary the old man had been. He was a nightmare for his generation in Fire Domain, one of the top-tier figures across the nine domains. Even among the nine domains, Gu Changqing was renowned.

With his boldness, Gu Changqing had written the eight characters—“One day, I will defy heaven”—on Tongtian Mountain. Later, for unknown reasons, he was sealed here and spent countless years before ending up in this state. He changed his name to Gu Tianshu, surviving as a shadow of his former self.

As for the reason, Luo Tian didn’t know. Gu Changqing seemed unwilling to reveal it, fearing it would harm Luo Tian’s cultivation. But Luo Tian guessed it was related to the mysterious heaven’s will.

“Though I can live for two more years, within a hundred li of this mountain, I am the master. If you have enemies, bring them here, and I’ll kill them for you!” Gu Tianshu’s voice carried immense confidence.

Luo Tian was stunned, gazing at Gu Tianshu with deep respect. This kind of unshakable belief was something Luo Tian knew, if Gu Tianshu ever acted, his life would end instantly. Unless he absorbed countless blood to prolong his life like the Netherworld’s nine saints, one act would end Gu Tianshu.

“Go. This barrier can’t stop me but won’t affect you much. I’ve given you everything I could!” Gu Changqing’s voice faded, and he slowly closed his eyes. His body became even more withered, as if a breeze could carry him away.

Luo Tian exited the barrier and bowed three times to Gu Changqing, then transformed into a streak of light outside Tongtian Mountain.

At that moment, Luo Tian gazed at the eight characters on Tongtian Mountain with even greater admiration for Gu Tianshu’s power.

“Spent a day and a half, but it was worth it! There are five days until the Shanshai Sect’s marriage competition. With my speed, three days will be enough to arrive. These two days are better spent mastering the Fanta Killing Technique and Dan technique, which I’m sure will be useful in the marriage competition—especially the Dan technique!”

“With my current Imperial-level alchemist status, winning is difficult. This opportunity will let me try to reach Saint-level alchemist. If I do, I’ll be solidly established in Fire Domain!” Luo Tian muttered, planning his next steps.

He glanced at Long Jie, who was still meditating before the stone wall, absorbing Gu Tianshu’s eight characters. Luo Tian didn’t disturb him and flew to Wang Xuanyang’s prepared courtyard, summoning the Zhen Hun Ding (Soul-Subduing Cauldron) to start brewing elixirs.

Though Luo Tian was now quiet, the news of Tongtian Sect had spread across Fire Domain. Most sects were eager to attend Shanshai Sect’s marriage competition, so the incident was temporarily ignored. However, news of the former Tongtian Sect Leader Ma Tongsun being killed and one of the Scorpion’s four leaders slain, with three others missing, spread widely.

Linking it to the new Tongtian Sect Leader—this young man who had killed those Superficial-level masters—it was naturally assumed he was the one.

But when people learned that the new Sect Leader was an eight Dao origin Celestial Sovereign, they realized Wang Xuanyang might be a decoy. The true mastermind was the one who had killed Ma Tongsun and massacred half of Tongtian Sect’s disciples.

Many probed the sect, but they found no trace of Luo Tian. The past two days saw thunderstorms and five-colored lightning constantly descending on Tongtian Sect, disappointing the probing disciples.

Yet as they probed further, these lightning strikes were filled with powerful fluctuations. Tongtian Sect glowed with golden light, and explosions echoed constantly. A holy aura spread, leaving the disciples stunned.
