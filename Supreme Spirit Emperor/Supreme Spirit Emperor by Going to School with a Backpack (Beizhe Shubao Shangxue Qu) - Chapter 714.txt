"Who is this? A disciple of the Ghost Valley Sect?" One by one, the monks radiated a serene aura. Their gazes fell upon Luo Tian without fear of the word "Ghost Valley" on his person.

"Earlier, I heard Master Jie Du say this Ghost Valley disciple is named Luo Tian!" The monks murmured, their gazes turning to Luo Tian.

"Front wolves, rear tigers!" Luo Tian sighed bitterly in his heart. He felt unlucky, having run to Mount Xumishan.

"Immortal King Yongsheng!" A shout erupted from the group of monks. Several figures stepped forward, their eyes filled with confusion.

"Brother Wu! Won't you come out and meet?" Yongsheng ignored the monks, instead gazing at the tall figure of the Buddha in the center. His voice echoed through heaven and earth.

"Yongsheng, you've overstepped!" A solemn voice rang out, causing Yongsheng's expression to darken.

Among the great immortal kings, Yongsheng feared only two: Bu Tian Immortal King and the Buddha of Mount Xumishan. However, the Buddha remained indifferent to worldly matters, appearing only twice before. Yongsheng rarely encountered him.

Chapter 2693: Blocking Immortal King Yongsheng

"Old friend, won't you come out and meet?" Yongsheng smiled, his long sword once again in hand.

"Yongsheng, your karmic debts are too deep. Our Buddhist sect will not stain itself with blood. You won't be able to kill this boy!" A solemn voice echoed, but the Buddha still did not reveal himself.

"Om Mani Padme Hum..." As the Buddha's words finished, all the monks on Mount Xumishan clasped their hands in prayer.

"If I insist on taking him?" Yongsheng sneered, seemingly recalling something. His gaze turned to the highest Buddha statue.

"If my guess is correct, you can't come out now. That's why you didn't appear when we encountered the sects of the Three Heavens!" Yongsheng's eyes glowed with divine laws, speaking again.

"Correct. I am currently in Nirvana!" The Buddha responded honestly. Upon his words, Yongsheng's face broke into a smile.

"Nirvana..." Luo Tian's expression slightly changed. He knew the Buddhist sect had this concept; once successful, one's strength would advance further.

"Striving for the Half-Immortal Emperor?" Yongsheng sighed, gazing at the highest Buddha statue. He knew Mount Xumishan had one hundred and eight Buddha statues, each housing a Buddha in its prime. The highest statue was where the历代 Buddhas resided.

The great immortal mountains had never been harmonious. Each peak's supreme immortal king wished to break free from their constraints, reaching higher realms. This would bring immense benefits to their respective immortal mountains, even attempting to unify the immortal realm.

"Seems I've arrived at the right time. If I obtain your relics, I might reach Half-Immortal Emperor!" Yongsheng chuckled.

"You dare!" Hearing Yongsheng's words, the monks' faces instantly showed anger.

Who was the Buddha? He was their faith, a being they would sacrifice their lives to protect. How could they allow Yongsheng to destroy the Buddha?

Suddenly, over thirty figures stood up, clad in robes, stepping forward. All were immortal kings!

"Terrifying!" Luo Tian gazed at them with disbelief. He hadn't expected Mount Xumishan to be this powerful, surpassing all other immortal mountains and the Ten Palaces of Yama. Moreover, this was only the early and middle stages of immortal kings; Luo Tian didn't believe Mount Xumishan had even one late-stage immortal king.

"Kid, I never thought you'd come here!" As Luo Tian was stunned, a figure with oil on his face appeared, holding a chicken leg. This figure's arrival immediately caused several people to frown and recite sutras.

"Zhi..." Luo Tian's eyes brightened, shouting. But before he could utter the word "zhi," a chicken leg flew toward his face, silencing him.

"You keep calling me that, I'll fight you!" Zhi Zhang monk cursed. Before he finished speaking, Zhi Zhang was slightly stunned.

"You've reached the late-stage immortal king!" Zhi Zhang carefully examined Luo Tian, then spoke directly.

"Yes, otherwise how could you have made it here?" Luo Tian's eyes brightened. At last, he saw a familiar face. Although his relationship with Zhi Zhang was average, he got along well with Jie Du. Also, the master of Duan Tian, Wang Duan Tian, seemed to know Zhi Zhang well.

"Surviving the pursuit of Immortal King Yongsheng, this Ghost Valley disciple Luo Tian must be incredibly strong!" Hearing Luo Tian's words, the monks immediately gasped, their gazes toward Luo Tian changing.

"Don't worry. As monks, we practice compassion. This old man won't harm you!" Zhi Zhang laughed, patting Luo Tian's shoulder.

"Kid, I'll handle some matters first. You can run away, but as long as you're in the Upper Three Heavens, you won't escape!" Immortal King Yongsheng laughed, raising his sword toward the central statue.

"Stop him!" A chorus of immortal kings immediately shouted, rushing toward Immortal King Yongsheng.

Rip...

Robes tore. Eighteen middle-stage immortal kings, their upper garments shattered, revealing toned muscles. They formed a formation - the Eighteen Arhats Formation.

"Hey, Master Zhi Zhang, you guys go ahead. I'll leave first!" Seeing both sides fighting, Luo Tian knew this was his chance to escape.

"Where are you going? You caused the trouble, and now you're leaving?" Zhi Zhang cursed. He didn't act like a monk at all. However, hearing Zhi Zhang's curse, the monks cheered. After all, Mount Xumishan had always remained indifferent to worldly matters. If not for Luo Tian drawing Immortal King Yongsheng, there would be no such trouble.

As they spoke, the Eighteen Arhats Formation clashed with Immortal King Yongsheng. Eighteen middle-stage immortal kings, their power soared. Even facing Immortal King Yongsheng, they showed no fear. They converged into a massive copper figure, striking toward Immortal King Yongsheng with one palm.

Immortal King Yongsheng wore a sneer. Though the Eighteen Arhats were powerful, forming an array could match even late-stage immortal kings, but they still fell far short of him.

A sky-piercing sword beam rose. It directly slashed the massive copper figure, shattering it in one strike. The eighteen middle-stage immortal kings were instantly scattered, each spitting blood.

"Is this even human!" Zhi Zhang exclaimed in disbelief, gazing at the overwhelming Immortal King Yongsheng.

"Brother Wu, I only want your relics. Hand them over to me, and I'll let your Mount Xumishan disciples go. Don't repeat the fate of the Tian Dao Sect!" Immortal King Yongsheng stepped forward, still heading toward the solemn Buddha statue. He raised his hand and slashed, blood splattered as a middle-stage immortal king blocking his path was severed in two.

"Three younger brothers, join me!" Seeing someone behead, an old man stepped forward with his hands clasped. His aura also radiated late-stage immortal king power.

"Om Mani Padme Hum..." Seeing the old man step forward, Zhi Zhang became solemn. His eyes showed respect, clasping his hands and reciting the mantra. At this moment, Zhi Zhang's aura changed. Luo Tian could see his aura becoming agile, with waves of Buddhist light rising from his head. He took a step forward, joining the three other old men blocking Immortal King Yongsheng's path.

"One leaf obscures the view..."

"Is he a disciple of Brother Wu?" Immortal King Yongsheng murmured, gazing at Zhi Zhang and the others. His long sword still pointed forward.

"Strong!" Luo Tian felt a sense of danger from any one of the four Zhi Zhang brothers.

"Run or not run?" Luo Tian's heart conflicted. If he ran away, he would feel like a coward.

Chapter 2694: One Leaf Obscures the View

"Om Mani Padme Hum..." Zhi Zhang and his three brothers recited the six-character mantra, their bodies radiating tremendous waves. They transformed into powerful attacks, pressing toward Immortal King Yongsheng.

"Buddhist power is indeed formidable!" Yongsheng finally took it seriously. He formed hand seals, and the Gate of Eternal Life appeared above his head, clashing with the six-character mantra.

Boom... Boom... The invisible waves collided with the Gate of Eternal Life. After six booms, the entire Gate of Eternal Life shattered, transforming into a dense vitality spreading in all directions.

"Om Mani Padme Hum..." Each Buddhist disciple clasped their hands, their bodies flashing waves of Buddhist light. They gathered above the group's heads, like countless suns in the heavens, illuminating the dark sky as if it were daytime.

As these waves of Buddhist light rose, Zhi Zhang's group became stronger. Clearly, this was a formation from Mount Xumishan, enhancing their strength.

Zhi Zhang's group bathed in divine light. Their power surged further. They recited the six-character mantra again, attacking Immortal King Yongsheng.

The thunderous collisions continued. Immortal King Yongsheng faced Zhi Zhang's group, undaunted. He continuously swung his sword and formed hand seals to unleash martial arts, clashing with the four of them. Each collision sent them trembling.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian also attacked. His body moved like a ghost, appearing behind Immortal King Yongsheng. He unleashed the "Breaking Void" spear technique, aiming for the back of Immortal King Yongsheng's heart.

Immortal King Yongsheng wore a cold expression. He lifted his sword to strike Zhi Zhang's group, then suddenly turned around and struck Luo Tian with one palm.

Crack... Crack... Green battle armor appeared on Immortal King Yongsheng's body. The "Breaking Void" spear struck the armor, but it was blocked without harming Immortal King Yongsheng.

Luo Tian received a palm strike from Immortal King Yongsheng, spitting blood that turned into a streak of light, flying backward.

Boom...

Luo Tian collided with the hand of a large Buddha statue. His entire body ached. He flew out and quickly swallowed a pill, his broken bones rapidly healing.

"Kid, use your martial arts from afar!" Zhi Zhang shouted at Luo Tian. The four of them continuously attacked, their Buddhist light flashing. Even Immortal King Yongsheng's attacks couldn't harm them; they could only be knocked back.

"Is this the Indestructible Body of the Diamond?" Immortal King Yongsheng raised an eyebrow. He slashed with his sword, destroying Luo Tian's spear technique storm.

"Great Diamond Palm!" Zhi Yi shouted. His robe continuously surged, a golden hand striking toward Immortal King Yongsheng.

Zhi Zhang, Zhi Ye, and Zhi Mu flew up, standing behind Zhi Yi. They positioned themselves correctly, channeling their cultivation power to Zhi Yi.

Suddenly, the golden hand expanded from a hundred feet to an immense size. This finally made Immortal King Yongsheng's expression change.

"Indeed, his disciple is strong!" Immortal King Yongsheng sighed. He pointed a finger out. A powerful wave from his fingertip surged, gathering into a green finger that collided with the golden hand.

Boom...

The collision caused the heavens to tremble. The finger and palm clashed, causing Immortal King Yongsheng to retreat. This time, Zhi Zhang's group was directly knocked back, spitting blood.

Boom... Boom...

A large number of Mount Xumishan's immortal realm disciples, who hadn't been protected in time, turned into blood mist, scattering on the ground.

The scent of blood spread. All Mount Xumishan disciples continuously recited sutras, their eyes filled with sorrow.

They had remained indifferent to the world, yet they hadn't expected such a sudden calamity.

"Master Buddha is in Nirvana. His four disciples can't withstand Immortal King Yongsheng. Will Mount Xumishan also become like Tian Dao Sect?" The disciples of Mount Xumishan showed anger.

"Blade Ascends the Immortal!"

"Blade Slaughters the World!" A shout rang out. Two sky-piercing sword beams swept forth, cutting through heaven and earth toward Immortal King Yongsheng.

"Useless. Unless you can unleash the third form!" Immortal King Yongsheng naturally recognized that Luo Tian was using the sword technique of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King.

"Blade of Killing Life!" Immortal King Yongsheng remained calm. His green long sword suddenly changed color to gray, its aura surged as he slashed.

Crack... Crack...

Luo Tian's two sword beams were again destroyed by Immortal King Yongsheng, vanishing from Luo Tian's sight.

"Great Ming Wang Seal!" Zhi Ye shouted. This time, it was Zhi Ye standing at the front. He formed hand seals, a golden Buddhist light seal pressing toward Immortal King Yongsheng.

"Bring out your Mount Xumishan's Diamond Subduing Staff, or you won't have a chance!" Immortal King Yongsheng remained calm. He raised his hand and struck, shattering the golden seal. He again scattered Zhi Zhang's group formation.

"Pu..." At the same time, a large number of Mount Xumishan disciples spat blood, their bodies showing weakness.

"Even the Indestructible Body of the Diamond enhanced by all Mount Xumishan disciples couldn't withstand his attack!" The disciples of Mount Xumishan showed despair. Immortal King Yongsheng's power exceeded their comprehension.

"The third form?" Luo Tian's lips bled. He didn't know the third form of the sword technique.

"However, I have other means beyond the Three Sword Forms!" Luo Tian whispered to himself. He wielded his broken sword, Zhu Xian, sending out waves of sword energy. His body also became ethereal.

Tremendous fluctuations arose, causing Immortal King Yongsheng to frown. On those waves of sword energy, he felt a sense of danger.

"Can't let him complete this sword array!" The next moment, Immortal King Yongsheng moved. His body flashed like lightning toward Luo Tian who was continuously moving Zhu Xian.

"Block him!" Zhi Zhang shouted. He also realized the power of Luo Tian's sword array.

"Great Diamond Subduing Fist!" Zhi Zhang took the lead this time, striking with a fist that shattered space toward Immortal King Yongsheng. This made Immortal King Yongsheng stop.

"Are you really trying to die?" Immortal King Yongsheng turned around, striking with a green hand. It collided with the fist imbued with Buddhist light.

The thunderous sound was overwhelming. Zhi Zhang's group flew back again, spitting blood, their faces flushed and bodies swaying in the sky.

As Zhi Zhang's group flew back, Luo Tian's Zhu Xian sword array was finally completed. Six hundred waves of destruction and heaven-shattering sword energy almost drained Luo Tian's cultivation.

In an instant, the waves of sword energy poured down, trapping Immortal King Yongsheng within the array. It seemed endless, continuously attacking Immortal King Yongsheng.

"What is this sword array!" Zhi Zhang's group showed admiration. They had clashed with Immortal King Yongsheng before and knew his power, yet they hadn't expected Luo Tian to hold him back with a sword array.

Chapter 2695: Diamond Subduing Staff

Mount Xumishan, sword energy纵横, destroying the void. Waves of sword energy complemented each other, attacking Immortal King Yongsheng, allowing Luo Tian and Zhi Zhang's group to catch their breath.

"Kid, you did well!" Zhi Zhang patted Luo Tian's shoulder. The four of them took deep breaths, especially Luo Tian, who had consumed too much energy since encountering Immortal King Yongsheng.

"Give him more!" Luo Tian shouted. The Yellow Spring Ruler reappeared in his hand. The Yellow Spring Water surged, pouring onto the ground. Waves of water rose, forming countless Yellow Spring soldiers.

"Did you have any other methods?" After summoning the Yellow Spring soldiers, Luo Tian looked at the four in disbelief.

"You actually have this!" Zhi Zhang's eyes showed disbelief, gazing at the two Yellow Spring soldiers of late-stage immortal king power.

"It can hold him for a while, but not for long!" Luo Tian replied. He then took out pills to recover.

Luo Tian had revealed all his secrets, but he knew even so, it wouldn't be enough to defeat Immortal King Yongsheng.

"Everyone prepare. Great Diamond Subduing Formation!" Zhi Yi shouted. They had no other options now but to rely on the power of all Mount Xumishan to counter Immortal King Yongsheng.

"Om Mani Padme Hum..." Each monk began to gather rapidly, converging toward the one hundred and eight Buddha statues.

Buzz...

Buddhist light flashed. Each monk of Mount Xumishan sat on the massive Buddha statues, reciting sutras.

"Earth Store Sutra... Lotus Sutra..." Each monk on the Buddha statues recited different scriptures. As the monks recited, the one hundred and eight Buddha statues radiated brilliant divine light. White relics slowly rose, finally transforming into images of powerful Buddhas that appeared in Luo Tian's view.

Boom...

At the same time, Immortal King Yongsheng finally shattered Zhu Xian's sword array and charged out with a furious aura.

Immortal King Yongsheng's face was dark. His body had several sword wounds. He wasn't a god; even an immortal king at the peak couldn't do anything. He had been in battle since chasing Luo Tian.

"Roar..." The Yellow Spring soldiers roared. Two late-stage immortal king Yellow Spring soldiers, along with several late-stage immortal king Yellow Spring soldiers, attacked Immortal King Yongsheng. Meanwhile, the one hundred and eight Buddha images attacked toward Immortal King Yongsheng. Each was a terrifying presence, making Luo Tian's heart tremble.

"If these one hundred and eight attacks hit me, I would definitely die. Even with thirty hits, I wouldn't survive!" Luo Tian whispered to himself, admiring the strength of Mount Xumishan. Moreover, there was still a world treasure not revealed. If it were revealed, another terrifying battle would follow.

"Ah..." Immortal King Yongsheng finally took it seriously. His green long sword turned gray again, sending out waves of destruction and heaven-shattering sword energy to counter the Yellow Spring soldiers. He also had to withstand one hundred and eight attacks.

Heaven and earth trembled, the void shattered. The wild fluctuations made Luo Tian and others have to retreat, fearing being caught in the waves.

The void was chaotic. Even with Luo Tian's spiritual sense, he couldn't break through the chaotic atmosphere to feel what was inside.

An hour passed. The one hundred and eight Buddha images disappeared, and each relic returned to the top of the Buddha statues. However, they were no longer bright but dimmer.

The storm hadn't calmed down yet. Luo Tian's expression was grim because he felt the Yellow Spring soldiers were weak. The Yellow Spring Water had flowed back into the Yellow Spring Ruler.

"Need to rest for a month..." Luo Tian whispered, the Yellow Spring Ruler had lost its divine laws.

Another hour passed. A green light burst out of the storm, directly rushing toward Luo Tian and Zhi Zhang's group.

Luo Tian and the others' faces changed. They retreated, vanishing from their original position.

"Indeed, Mount Xumishan is more troublesome than Tian Dao Sect." Immortal King Yongsheng stood at the position of Luo Tian and the four, his clothes torn. His breathing was chaotic, clearly having taken a lot of damage from those attacks.

"It's been a while since I felt injured!" Immortal King Yongsheng sighed. His lower abdomen had a deep wound, green light flashing. The wound rapidly healed.

"This is how it's fought? This isn't even dead!" Zhi Zhang and the others were speechless. Luo Tian hadn't expected that attack to fail in seriously wounding Immortal King Yongsheng.

"What other techniques do you have?" Immortal King Yongsheng sneered. The aura of a late-stage immortal king again erupted, his feet stepping forward toward Luo Tian and the others.

"Great Diamond Subduing Staff!" Zhi Zhang's group exchanged glances. Their current state was very poor, and they couldn't fight Immortal King Yongsheng directly. They could only use the world treasure to counter him.

Buzz...

A divine light rose, again illuminating the entire sky. A golden staff arose, shaking all heavens. Divine light poured down, a powerful pressure descending, surpassing the immortal king level.

Zhi Zhang's group showed madness. They concentrated their cultivation power into the golden staff.

The divine light surged, a powerful pressure descending. The staff fell from the sky toward Immortal King Yongsheng.

Divine laws subdued all directions. Immortal King Yongsheng's face showed a smile because he knew that if he could withstand this strike, Zhi Zhang's group would no longer have the strength to control the Great Diamond Subduing Staff.

"This is a world treasure!" Luo Tian's eyes showed admiration. This strike could pierce through heaven and earth, subduing everything.

"Absolute Life Sword!" Immortal King Yongsheng shouted. He launched his long sword, countless divine script chains flying out from his hand, surrounding the gray long sword before merging into it.

Buzz... Buzz...

The sword beam flickered. The gray long sword expanded, transforming into a heaven-opening sword that rushed toward the subduing staff.

In an instant, one sword and one staff collided in front of Luo Tian's group. The entire world stopped.

One hundred and eight Buddha statues, their heads radiated waves of divine light, enveloping the Mount Xumishan disciples sitting there.

Luo Tian and Zhi Zhang's group heard thunderous sounds in their ears. They were hit by the collision's waves, spitting blood and flying backward, colliding with the Buddha statues again.

"Great Diamond Subduing Staff is nothing!" A laugh echoed. Immortal King Yongsheng's mouth bled, his chest caved in. This time he had been seriously wounded.

"Game over!" Zhi Zhang looked at Immortal King Yongsheng. The subduing staff flew back, unknown where it had gone.

Although Immortal King Yongsheng was seriously wounded, everyone knew he excelled at recovery. This injury wasn't enough for him.

And Immortal King Yongsheng's long sword had also disappeared, obviously destroyed in the collision with the subduing staff.

"Gate of Eternal Life!" Immortal King Yongsheng raised his hand, a green gate descending from the sky to crush Luo Tian and the five.

"Monkey, aren't you coming out yet? We're about to die!" Zhi Zhang shouted at the descending gate.

Chapter 2696: The Battle-Devote Buddha

The green Gate of Eternal Life radiated a pressure to crush everything, descending toward Luo Tian and the others. That pressure made them grimace. If they were crushed, they would die or at least lose a layer of skin. Zhi Zhang screamed in fear.

As Zhi Zhang's words finished, a shocking battle spirit arose. A golden light shot up to the sky, directly rushing toward the green gate.

A staff! A golden staff, carrying overwhelming power, struck down on the green gate.

Boom...

Luo Tian's group's heads seemed to explode. They instantly lost their hearing and took a step back.

The Gate of Eternal Life shattered, and the golden staff also flew back, spinning into the void. Golden light spread everywhere. A figure stood proudly in the world, battle spirit soaring. He grabbed the rotating staff with one hand.

Golden fur fluttered constantly. Holding a golden staff, he looked like a war god. His golden eyes gazed at Immortal King Yongsheng.

"You finally came out!" Seeing the monkey-like figure, Zhi Zhang laughed. Luo Tian's body suddenly trembled.

"Demon Lord, Demon Emperor Tian!" Luo Tian recognized this monkey. It wasn't the Demon Emperor Tian who else?

"Who are you?" Immortal King Yongsheng's eyes also showed shock, gazing at Demon Emperor Tian and sensing his aura.

"Immortal King Peak!" The disciples of Mount Xumishan exclaimed, their eyes filled with excitement. They hadn't expected that besides the Buddha, Mount Xumishan also had an immortal king peak.

"Has he achieved Nirvana?" Zhi Zhang's group showed joy, gazing at the figure standing there, Demon Emperor Tian.

"It's the Battle-Devote Buddha!" The disciples of Mount Xumishan shouted, gazing at Demon Emperor Tian with excitement.

"I never thought it was the Battle-Devote Buddha. I always believed the Buddha had subdued him, but he achieved immortal king peak!" The disciples of Mount Xumishan immediately became excited, gazing at the figure with overwhelming aura.

"Father!" As everyone was astonished, another figure appeared - Yao Chen.

After Tianyuan Sect stabilized, Yao Chen had been searching for Demon Emperor Tian's whereabouts. Later, he found him here at Mount Xumishan.

"Yao Chen!" Luo Tian's eyes showed joy, gazing at Yao Chen. At this moment, Yao Chen had reached the late-stage immortal king.

As Luo Tian was delighted, Demon Emperor Tian moved. His aura surged. He swung his golden staff downward.

"Damn it!" Immortal King Yongsheng's face darkened. He could sense Demon Emperor Tian's unstable aura, his strength slightly inferior to those who had reached immortal king peak for years. However, Immortal King Yongsheng's current state wasn't good either. After continuous battles, both his consumption and injuries were significant. He didn't know if he could defeat Demon Emperor Tian. One thing was certain: capturing Demon Emperor Tian would cost him a heavy price.

But now, Immortal King Yongsheng couldn't stop the battle. A substantial battle spirit enveloped him. At the same time, the golden staff fell from the sky with overwhelming power.

"Only a monkey?" Immortal King Yongsheng shouted. He reached out, his green hand凝聚 instantly and grabbed the golden staff.

Boom...

A heavy sound rose. The green hand shattered, and Immortal King Yongsheng and Demon Emperor Tian fell to the ground. They seemed frozen in place, gazing at each other. Simultaneously, they extended their other hands toward each other and struck.

Their palms collided. Both flew back. They stepped on the ground, rushing toward each other again. Heaven and earth trembled. The terrifying display of an immortal king peak battle was fully revealed. Each confrontation left Luo Tian's group in awe.

"Why did you come here?" As Yao Chen observed Demon Emperor Tian's battle, he asked Luo Tian.

"Tianyuan Sect has some trouble. I need to find reinforcements for Tianyuan Sect!" Luo Tian didn't hide it, recounting the entire story of Tianyuan Sect to Yao Chen. They exchanged words; Yao Chen also told Luo Tian about his experiences.

"Why did your father become an immortal king peak?" Luo Tian asked, his voice filled with confusion.

When everyone ascended, Demon Emperor Tian was still at the half-step epoch. Luo Tian didn't believe any opportunity could make Demon Emperor Tian reach immortal king peak.

Luo Tian was confident and had many opportunities, but he hadn't been that extreme. He was still at the late-stage immortal king, which was already considered extreme.

"Long story. What you see now is my father, but it's also not my father!" Yao Chen sighed.

"My father practiced the Eight-Nine Profound Skill. He was also a Buddhist, emphasizing rebirth and karmic cycles."

"However, Demon Emperor Tian is one of my father's incarnations. He reincarnated in the Nine Realms. There were seventy-one such incarnations!" Yao Chen sighed.

"The Eight-Nine Profound Skill..." Luo Tian slightly startled, having never heard of such a technique.

"Seventy-two incarnations total. My father was the last one, enduring hardships and achieving rebirth seventy-two times. Once successful, his strength would undergo a qualitative leap!"

"Now he's not Demon Emperor Tian but Mount Xumishan, the Battle-Devote Buddha..." Yao Chen replied, making Luo Tian understand.

"Does he still recognize you?" Luo Tian turned to Yao Chen, his eyes showing concern.

"I don't know. Since I came to Mount Xumishan, he's been in Nirvana. This is the first time I've seen him!" Yao Chen's eyes showed hesitation. This was the first time Luo Tian had seen such a look on Yao Chen.

"Don't worry. Although this monkey practices the Eight-Nine Profound Skill, he's merged with the last incarnation. His memories are still there. He'll definitely recognize you!" Zhi Zhang made a promise. He was clearly very familiar with the Battle-Devote Buddha.

While they spoke, Immortal King Yongsheng and the Battle-Devote Buddha had reached a fever pitch. Their seemingly simple confrontations contained supreme divine laws.

"Annihilation of All Directions!" Immortal King Yongsheng roared. His body was battered, his hands forming seals. Around him, waves of energy surged, blowing his torn robe.

The sky darkened. Suddenly, the entire Mount Xumishan area within ten thousand miles seemed to be restrained by some power. A wild energy rose, gathering toward Immortal King Yongsheng. Luo Tian's group felt fear. Even those Mount Xumishan disciples within the sutra formation were filled with fear.

The Battle-Devote Buddha's eyes glowed golden. He gazed at Immortal King Yongsheng without the slightest fear. With one step, his body split into two, then four. In an instant, he became seventy-two Battle-Devote Buddhas, each radiating overwhelming power.

"This is the Eight-Nine Profound Skill. This technique has always existed in Mount Xumishan, but no one has ever mastered it. Not even the Buddha himself achieved success. It's truly difficult, but once mastered, it becomes earth-shattering!" Zhi Zhang's eyes showed excitement as he spoke.

Chapter 2697: Revisiting the Immortal Mountain

Seventy-two Battle-Devote Monkeys struck with countless staff shadows, like waves of the sea, overturning the heavens and striking toward Immortal King Yongsheng.

Immortal King Yongsheng's eyes were serious, but he showed no fear. He clenched his hands forward and凝聚 a gray long sword in front of him.

The desert was naturally lifeless. After Immortal King Yongsheng's extraction, the vitality within ten thousand miles nearly disappeared. Even the originally golden sand turned black. The entire world became lifeless.

Boom... Boom... Boom...

In the stunned gaze of Luo Tian's group, staff shadows collided with sword shadows. The heavens shattered. Luo Tian and the others formed a barrier to protect themselves.

The wild winds collided with the barrier, causing Luo Tian's group to tremble and spit blood.

After half an hour of collision, it finally stopped. The barrier also couldn't withstand it. Luo Tian's group quickly looked up at the sky.

The Battle-Devote Buddha still stood there with his staff, his battle spirit overwhelming. He gazed at the distance.

Drip... Drip...

"What is this?" Luo Tian wondered, seeing his shoulder turn red. He looked at the Battle-Devote Buddha.

"You're injured!" Luo Tian carefully observed, seeing drops of divine blood falling from the sky. It was from the Battle-Devote Buddha.

Meanwhile, Immortal King Yongsheng's figure had also disappeared. The Battle-Devote Buddha fell from the sky, and as he landed, he struck Zhi Zhang with one staff.

Boom...

No one expected the Battle-Devote Buddha to suddenly attack Zhi Zhang. Zhi Zhang was immediately struck by one staff, flying backward and rolling several times.

"Damn it! You monkey, do you think you're at the peak of hope?" Zhi Zhang got up from the ground and shouted.

"My wine, it's all gone! Don't even think about it; you stole it!" The Battle-Devote Buddha shouted back. His aura disappeared, looking like a monkey. Luo Tian was stunned.

"You..." Zhi Zhang heard the Battle-Devote Buddha's words, his aura immediately weakened. He stepped behind Zhi Yi, and the Battle-Devote Buddha had indeed visited his place many times during his Nirvana.

Zhi Zhang's three brothers glared at Zhi Zhang, cursing inwardly. Who dared to offend this monkey? Even the Buddha hadn't been able to subdue him before his Nirvana. He often caused chaos in Mount Xumishan. Zhi Zhang had even stolen things from the monkey.

"Where is Immortal King Yongsheng?" Zhi Mu quickly changed the subject, asking the Battle-Devote Buddha.

"He left. I couldn't hold him back. When my cultivation stabilizes, I'll go to Immortal King Yongsheng's mountain and kill him!" The Battle-Devote Buddha spoke. Although he had become a Buddha and was at the peak of immortal king, his inherent fighting nature remained.

"Truly like..." Luo Tian looked at the Battle-Devote Buddha, confirming that this person would definitely recognize Yao Chen. He was too similar to the previous Demon Emperor Tian, much more lively. He had no appearance of an elder at all.

"You're my son, right? You did well. You've ascended to the immortal realm. You're the one who brought honor!" The Battle-Devote Buddha gazed at Yao Chen.

"Om Mani Padme Hum..." Hearing the Battle-Devote Buddha's words, each of the Mount Xumishan immortal kings who had emerged recited sutras. After all, the Buddhist sect emphasized the four emptinesses. The Battle-Devote Buddha having a son clearly violated the precept of celibacy.

"Come on, let's go in..." Zhi Yi coughed and invited Luo Tian's group to head toward Mount Xumishan.

People walked into the golden hall of Mount Xumishan under the curious glances of the disciples. The hall was surrounded by Buddha statues, with a strong incense aroma.

"What's going on?" As they entered the hall, everyone's gaze fell on Luo Tian. Some faces showed anger. If not for Luo Tian drawing Immortal King Yongsheng, Mount Xumishan wouldn't be in this situation.

"I want to go to the Immortal Mountain!" Luo Tian spoke to everyone, explaining his purpose.

"I have some karmic connection with Tianyuan Sect. So I won't sit idly by!" Hearing Luo Tian's words, the Battle-Devote Buddha spoke to him.

"Do you really want to get involved?" Hearing the Battle-Devote Buddha's words, Zhi Yi and others showed concern.

"I can't leave. The Buddha is in the critical moment of Nirvana, and I also have injuries. I need to stay at Mount Xumishan!" The Battle-Devote Buddha spoke again, making Luo Tian sigh deeply.

"Indeed, he's changed..." Luo Tian knew the Battle-Devote Buddha would get involved with Tianyuan Sect, but only if it didn't affect Mount Xumishan.

"I'll send my son with you. Also, take this!" The Battle-Devote Buddha spoke to Luo Tian, extending his hand and pulling out three hairs from his body. He blew on them, sending them to Yao Chen.

Seeing the Battle-Devote Buddha's actions, Zhi Zhang and his group's eyes slightly changed but said nothing. Yao Chen's body trembled slightly.

"This journey is dangerous. These three hairs can help you withstand three immortal king peaks. The rest depends on your luck!" The Battle-Devote Buddha spoke.

"Thank you, elder!" Luo Tian bowed to the Battle-Devote Buddha. No matter what, the Battle-Devote Buddha hadn't ignored it.

"Settling karmic connections..." The Battle-Devote Buddha whispered, gazing at Luo Tian and Yao Chen.

The next morning, Luo Tian and Yao Chen left Mount Xumishan. No one saw them off. They walked on the black desert.
