“Kill!” Without Long Jie, the top combatant, Luo Tian and his two companions fell back relentlessly. In contrast, He Qingming advanced like a flood breaking through barriers, his aura overwhelming; anyone caught in his sweep spat out blood profusely.

“This won’t work—keep going like this, and we’ll all die!” The three communicated silently, their eyes filled with desperation.

Luo Tian’s heart pounded with urgency, but no solution came to mind. His only ace was the Ancient Heaven Palace, yet returning there would expose his knowledge of its secrets. If he did so, it wouldn’t be a late-stage divine being chasing him—it would be an apex divine being.

As Luo Tian mused, He Qingming’s fist struck him, sending him crashing beside Long Jie.

Yet Luo Tian hadn’t exhausted himself like Long Jie; his divine power remained abundant, though two ribs were fractured.

Rising, Luo Tian prepared to soar skyward when a glint of gold caught his eye.

“Injuring Heaven Bow!” Luo Tian’s face lit with hope. He called to the battered Diao Dete and Nan Gong Yuqing above.

“Come down! Here!” His voice halted their flight, though they didn’t know his plan. Still, they obeyed, descending to his side.

The rhinoceros clan’s people trembled. Xi Hongda sighed internally: “Still not enough. Late-stage divine beings are too powerful. Even prodigies can’t match He Qingming when they’re two stages apart.”

“Hmph, little one. Have you finally seen reason? Surrender now—let me draw your divine blood to elevate our crane clan’s lineage. Hand over the two pseudo-epoch treasures!” He Qingming stood atop a mountain, his face aloof as he addressed Luo Tian’s group.

At this moment, the three were thoroughly battered, their bodies riddled with wounds. If not for divine-grade elixirs, they’d have collapsed long ago.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian sent a mental message to Du Hongtao and Lu Hanian, urging them to return.

Du and Lu were equally wounded, their faces pale. Having only recently reached late-stage divine, they couldn’t match the years of experience and power of Xiong Dali and He Zhanpeng. Their haste had left them vulnerable, and now they clung to survival.

“Little one, are you giving up?” He Qingming loomed above, his gaze sweeping over the battered Luo Tian.

Xiong and He stood at his side, their wounds evident but their faces alight with excitement. The two pseudo-epoch treasures were invaluable to their clans, and Luo Tian and Long Jie’s blood was a temptation too great.

“Old dog, you dare!” Luo Tian panted, his eyes locking onto the three above. He grabbed Long Jie’s Injuring Heaven Bow, a cruel glint in his gaze.

“This is the final clash!” Luo Tian murmured, channeling his bloodline power to calm the defiant bow.

Though he and Long Jie’s bloodlines were intertwined, after a while, the bow stilled in his grasp, glowing with soft radiance.

“Little one, you’re still stubborn! Did you think a pseudo-epoch treasure could match me?” As Luo Tian lifted the bow, He Qingming’s face twitched. Remembering how Long Jie had been drained after one shot, his fearless demeanor faltered.

“I may be wounded, but I can still withstand one shot!” He Qingming’s face bore confidence. White feathers erupted from his hands, forming a shield before him.

“Kill!” He Zhanpeng and Xiong Dali seized the chance, unleashing devastating martial arts toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Epoch Bell!” Luo Tian snapped his fingers, and the golden Epoch Bell rang out, enveloping them in a radiant aura. The attacks struck the shield with thunderous roars, but Luo Tian’s group felt nothing.

“This…” Xiong and He exchanged glances, their expressions shifting to joy. They knew the pseudo-epoch treasure was now theirs.

“The pseudo-epoch treasure is indeed formidable—such attacks can’t breach its defense!” He Qingming’s brow furrowed, uncertain if his assault could pierce the shield.

Luo Tian exhaled deeply, calming his aura and attuning himself to peak condition. His mind’s wholeness allowed him to steady instantly, his eyes blazing with intensity as he locked onto He Qingming.

“Zing…” The Injuring Heaven Bow hummed, black demonic energy coalescing into a dark arrow. The sky trembled as the arrow’s aura surged, making He Qingming frown.

“Kill…” Xiong and He persisted, their martial arts raining down, but the Epoch Bell repelled them.

“Buddha’s Assault!” Luo Tian roared, and the black arrow emitted a piercing hum. The world seemed to shudder as its overwhelming power threatened to tear everything apart, deepening He Qingming’s grimace.

He sensed this arrow was no weaker than Long Jie’s. The shock made him summon his full strength, and a mournful sound echoed around him. He Qingming was confident this defense could withstand Luo Tian’s shot, and after that, he’d finish them.

“Burst…” The string snapped, the arrow’s power reaching its zenith. Luo Tian’s hand flickered, and the dark projectile vanished from sight, streaking toward He Qingming.

Unseen, unstoppable—He Qingming’s heart clenched as he recalled Long Jie’s shot.

The black arrow pierced the void, its speed defying human reflexes, surpassing even Luo Tian’s Shadow Step.

“Boom…” A sharp explosion echoed, leaving everyone staring in disbelief.

He Qingming’s face darkened as he glared at Luo Tian, hatred burning in his eyes. He’d prepared to withstand the shot, but the arrow had seemingly aimed for him—yet his barrier remained intact. His body, however, let out a brittle sound.

“Brilliant!” Xu Liyi stood within the Epoch Bell, his foot crushing a half-divine-level crane clan member’s face as he bellowed.

Xi Hongda gaped at Luo Tian, certain he couldn’t have escaped that shot—surely annihilated.

Indeed, the arrow had erased He Zhanpeng from view without a sound or blood, no chance for rebirth.

All eyes turned to Luo Tian, stunned by his move.

Chapter 1006: The Demon Arrow Pierces the Heavens

Within the rhinoceros clan’s domain, people trembled as they watched Luo Tian, clutching the Injuring Heaven Bow beneath the golden bell.

“A late-stage divine being has fallen! And it’s He Qingming, the crane clan leader!” The rhinoceros people gaped in awe and terror.

A late-stage divine being—no sound, no warning—was obliterated by Luo Tian’s single shot. Such terrifying power was beyond comprehension.

He Qingming stood within his barrier, stunned. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to target He Zhanpeng instead of himself.

“Little one, I’ve decided—your life will be a torment!” He Qingming’s cold voice echoed through the barrier, his fury evident.

A crane clan leader slain by a lowly early-stage divine being? The humiliation would shatter their pride, especially after being defeated by a mere novice.

“One shot is your limit. Once I destroy this bell, I’ll torment you. I’ll even hunt to Fire Domain and exterminate anyone linked to you!” He Qingming threatened.

Nearby, Xiong Dali’s massive form trembled. His strength matched He Zhanpeng’s, but as he took a step toward He Qingming, a wave of oceanic sound erupted. Then came the arrow’s hum—heart-stopping.

The ominous aura returned, and the black arrow pierced through the sky, striking Xiong Dali’s massive form. The arrow consumed him instantly, vanishing from sight.

“Two arrows—two late-stage divine beings!” The rhinoceros clan gasped, their eyes wide as they gazed at Luo Tian, the demon energy swirling around him like a supreme devil.

“Old dog, if you want to kill me, I’ll start by eliminating your disciples. Let’s see who truly dies today!” Luo Tian’s voice was cold, his eyes locking onto He Qingming.

“Luo Tian…” He Qingming gritted his teeth, stunned Luo Tian had another shot left.

He Qingming’s mind darkened. He wanted to exit the barrier and kill Luo Tian, but he hesitated—was there another shot? Destroying the Epoch Bell would take time.

“Old dog, dare to come out and fight me?!” Xu Liyi cursed.

“Old fool, let’s have a showdown! You dare?”

“Old beast, are you even a man? Scared of a mere transcendent!” Zheng Xin and Gu Lei joined in, their voices sharp.

With Tian Luo’s help, the four brawlers taunted He Qingming relentlessly. Even Lu Hanian felt overwhelmed.

Diao Dete’s eyes gleamed as he watched the four. “Fall back—Master Diao is about to show off!”

Diao Dete transformed into human form, his gait sly as he stepped out of the bell’s shadow. He crossed his arms, gazing at He Qingming.

He beckoned with a finger, his aura exuding loneliness and nobility, as if an invincible master. His gaze swept over He Qingming: “He Qingming, come out. I’ll reverse the battle and fight you at a higher level—dare?”

“Damn, this kid’s too full of himself. I respect him! But I want to punch him!” Zheng Xin and the others grinned, admiration in their eyes.

“Crack…” He Qingming’s face darkened as he spat blood, his fury mounting. These ants dared to mock him, their insults growing bolder. His chest seethed with anger, and he spat blood.

“Haha! Old dog’s spitting blood—keep going, don’t die yet! We’d prefer your corpse for our fire pit!” Xu Liyi laughed, slaying a crane clan youth and roasting it over flames for Chen Zhanbiao.

“Puke…” He Qingming’s blood spewed, his cries wild. Watching his kin devoured as food, he wanted to retaliate but stopped at the sight of Luo Tian’s Injuring Heaven Bow. His body trembled, watching Xu Liyi and the others, especially Diao Dete who had left the bell.

The rhinoceros clan was speechless, their faces grim. Though the crane clan wasn’t kin, they were still beast clans—yet to see their kind roasted was unbearable.

“Disgusting, not as good as the two divine sons from the Heaven Palace!” Xu Liyi grimaced, spitting out a mouthful of meat.

“Damn it!” The rhinoceros clan felt uneasy, hearing their words implied they’d eaten the two divine sons.

“Ah…” He Qingming roared from within his barrier, his face twisted with fury. Yet he remained rational, scanning Luo Tian’s eyes for a fleeting sign of fatigue.

“You’re bluffing!” He Qingming’s face turned cold, his grin sinister as he scanned the group.

“Damn!” The four brawlers’ faces shifted, and Diao Dete lost his masterly aura, streaking back into the bell.

“Haha! Little one, you’re still naive. I’ve lived millions of years—can’t be tricked by these hairless brats!” He Qingming laughed, his hands sweeping. The barrier vanished, white feathers forming a storm that swept toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Haha! Old fool, you’ve been tricked!” Zheng Xin and the others laughed, their fear gone.

“Still bluffing? You think I’d believe?” He Qingming’s hands moved, runes flying into the white storm. It surged toward the Epoch Bell with apocalyptic force.

“Boom…” The bell’s sound echoed, its power rippling outward. With the rhinoceros clan’s senior disciples’ combined efforts, they protected their people.

The white storm battered the Epoch Bell, scattering sand and stone—each grain could kill a transcendent.

“Puke…” Though the bell shielded them, the four spat blood.

“Truly fierce! Late-stage divine beings are terrifying!” Gu Lei and the others wiped their mouths, fear in their eyes as they gazed at He Qingming’s towering presence.

He Qingming was stunned—his fury had unleashed his full strength, yet the pseudo-epoch treasure remained unscathed. He confirmed its power and resolved to capture Luo Tian.

“Old dog, since you’ve emerged, it’s my turn!” Luo Tian’s cold voice made He Qingming start. The familiar, chilling aura returned.

“Burst…” The arrow’s string hummed, and the black arrow surged from the bell, appearing before He Qingming.

“You still…?” He Qingming’s words trailed off as the arrow shot from the void, striking him.

“Crane Divine Step!” He Qingming shouted, his feet glowing white as he vanished.

“Your speed? You still underestimate your crane clan!” Diao Dete shook his head, knowing no technique could evade a pseudo-epoch treasure’s arrow unless his grandfather used Shadow Step.

“Boom…” Diao Dete’s words had barely finished when a blood mist erupted in the sky. He Qingming, though not killed outright, bore severe wounds. His cultivation dropped to late-stage divine, his aura diminished but still formidable.

“Old dog, I told you you were tricked! How could you live millions of years and be fooled by a brat?”

“Exactly! You’ve lived so long, yet you’re still a fool!” The four laughed wildly. He Qingming was now powerless against them.

“The pseudo-epoch treasure is truly terrifying—its arrow shattered a late-stage divine being!” Xi Hongda stood afar, his face pale.

“What’s your dan Tian made of? It has endless divine power!” He Qingming raged internally, his face filled with resentment.

“This is the pseudo-epoch treasure—capable of turning a certain death into victory!” Luo Tian smiled, his black demon energy still abundant. He formed another arrow on the bow.

“Old dog, time to send you off!” Luo Tian smiled, releasing the string with a soft motion.

“Damn it!” He Qingming roared, his white feathers forming another barrier before him.

Chapter 1007: Departure

The white crane feathers still roared, but He Qingming was now severely wounded. His cultivation had plummeted, his essence damaged—recovery would take years, even with divine herbs.

The white barrier formed before He Qingming as Luo Tian’s black demon arrow pierced the sky, streaking toward the barrier.

“Crack…” Thunder roared as the black arrow embedded itself in the white barrier, lightning flashing. In an instant, it reached He Qingming’s front.

“Boom…” Predictably, He Qingming’s body exploded into a blood mist, scattering across the sky.

Yet the barrier had softened the blow—this arrow hadn’t fully annihilated He Qingming. When he reformed, his face was pale, his cultivation dropped to early-stage divine, his aura weak.

“Haha! Early-stage divine, old dog—come on, let’s fight!” Xu Liyi leapt from the bell.

“Old dog, I’ll see what tricks you have!” Diao Dete and others flew out of the bell, surrounding He Qingming.

He Qingming’s face was grim. Once a pitiful creature trapped in the bell, now he was the one surrounded.

“The pseudo-epoch treasure is truly terrifying—its arrow has reduced a late-stage divine being to this!” The rhinoceros clan trembled, watching Luo Tian.

“His dan Tian must be made of what? It has endless divine power—unlike most early-stage divine beings, who would be drained after one shot!” A rhinoceros early-stage divine being marveled at Luo Tian, sensing the arrow’s power was immense. He doubted he could fire a second shot.

Luo Tian smiled, his divine power still surging in his dan Tian. His dan Tian had expanded significantly, its power rivaling a late-stage divine being.

The main reason was his three divine herbs—residual power still lingered in his body. He hoped more strong opponents would come, allowing him to eliminate them effortlessly. He estimated he could fire about fifteen arrows—such was the power of divine herbs.

But he knew obtaining that herb from Meng Lingyun’s Silk Cocoon was impossible unless Meng Lingyun revived.

“Boom… Boom…” He Qingming bounced like a ball as the four battered him, his late-stage divine aura now meaningless.

“Alas… enough playing—let’s end this respectfully!” Luo Tian sighed, addressing the group.

“Puke…” Blood surged as a blood-red sword pierced He Qingming’s chest, absorbing his life force. South Palace Yuqing’s sword subtly pointed toward the Heaven Palace’s Bloodthirsty Sword.

Golden bones fell from the sky, glowing with faint blue light as they landed on the ground, making the rhinoceros clan tremble.

“A late-stage divine being’s bones! A true late-stage divine being has perished, slain by an early-stage one. Truly astonishing!” Xi Hongda sighed internally, gazing at Luo Tian.

Long Jie had recovered somewhat, and others landed on the ground, their faces filled with excitement. They couldn’t believe they’d killed a late-stage divine being.

“Prepare—let’s go!” Luo Tian handed the Injuring Heaven Bow to Long Jie, addressing everyone.

The group’s faces shifted—after their victory, they hadn’t considered the danger of being in the Beast Domain. They’d killed two major clans’ members, including a late-stage divine being. The clans would retaliate.

“Long Jie, you and Diao Dete go to the Shadow Step Clan. Master Diao Yuan will protect you, awakening your Dragon Ancestry. Don’t emerge until reaching late-stage divine!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed concern, reiterating his warning. From He Qingming’s actions, the Beast Domain might target Long Jie.

“Brother!” Long Jie wanted to speak but was cut off by Luo Tian, who knew he needed to stay. Luo Tian also knew returning to the Fire Domain wouldn’t be simple.

“I’ll go alone, not relying on you!” Tian Luo spoke, gazing at Luo Tian. He wanted to train alone.

Luo Tian’s brow furrowed, then nodded: “Fine, but go to the Shadow Step Clan first. Wait for the storm to pass before leaving secretly.”

Luo Tian turned, addressing Du Hongtao and Lu Hanian: “Senior disciples, come with me. I’ll go alone—wait for the storm to pass before returning to the Fire Domain.”

“No!” The group’s faces shifted—Luo Tian wanted to draw out those who plotted against him, ensuring their safety.

“Don’t argue—trust me. I have a way to escape!” Luo Tian shook his head, determined and assuring them he’d be fine.

“Gu Lei, after you return to the Fire Domain with Senior Master Lu, go to Tongtian Sect and wait for me!” Luo Tian reiterated, sending Diao Dete with them.

Under Long Jie’s threat, Luo Tian sheathed the Injuring Heaven Bow, now possessing two pseudo-epoch treasures.

“Go!” Luo Tian urged them, sensing the major clans’ power was near.

After parting with everyone, Luo Tian turned to Xi Hongda, his face apologetic: “Senior, I’m sorry for causing trouble. If I survive, I’ll repay the rhinoceros clan’s kindness.”

Luo Tian spoke, not waiting for Xi Hongda to respond. He waved his hand, and a river of elixirs flowed, dropping an elixir over the rhinoceros clan’s territory.

“This is a late-stage divine elixir I’ve kept—use it to offset your losses!” Luo Tian gazed at Xi Hongda.

“Rest assured, we rhinoceros clan aren’t one of the eight major clans, but we’re not pushovers!” Xi Hongda’s face reddened. Previously, when his friends were insulted by the two clans, they’d done little. Now with these priceless elixirs, he felt guilty.

“Take it,” Luo Tian said, “I’ll never forget the rhinoceros clan’s care in the Beast Domain. I must leave quickly—goodbye!”

Luo Tian felt a tremor, addressing Xi Hongda. He vanished in an instant, his body infused with runes as he activated the Teleportation Technique.

“I’ll see who dares attack me!” Luo Tian’s face darkened, his hand grasping, transforming into a green-robed Taoist. He flew toward the Fire Domain.

After leaving the rhinoceros clan’s territory, two massive spiritual senses swept across it.

Xi Hongda had just collected Luo Tian’s elixirs, his face paled. He gazed at the void, respect in his eyes.

The rhinoceros clan’s others prepared for reconstruction, pretending not to notice.

“Wish you a safe journey. The Beast Domain has taken on such a menace—it’s truly its misfortune,” Xi Hongda sighed, murmuring.

When Luo Tian appeared outside the Beast Domain’s Holy City, spiritual senses scanned him. He frowned—these senses included transcendent-level ones.

“Still think I’m a fool! Transcendents dare to eye me? Come if you dare!” Luo Tian, disguised as an old Taoist, held He Qingming’s fan and flew toward the Fire Domain.

He’d only altered his appearance slightly; a keen observer would spot his true face.

Flying swiftly, he became a meteor. His real identity was soon discovered by pursuers, who followed closely.

Luo Tian’s lips curled into a cruel smile. His killing intent gathered: “None dare to strike? All want to save their strength for the end?”

He shook his head, expanding his spiritual senses. The only ones he cared about were three groups—each led by a late-stage divine being. Though their strength might not match He Qingming, without the pseudo-epoch treasure, he’d lose to them.

“Troublesome,” Luo Tian sighed, accelerating further. He vanished from sight—only late-stage divine beings could catch him.

Indeed, his speed left many behind. Only three late-stage divine beings remained.

Chapter 1008: A Bloody Journey Home

In the Beast Domain’s Holy City, news spread swiftly after Luo Tian’s departure: the four-star domain’s Luo Tian had exited the city, using a pseudo-epoch treasure to slay He Qingming, a late-stage divine being.

This news ignited the city like a storm, shaking even the Beast Domain.

Another revelation stunned everyone: Luo Tian was a rare reincarnation body, ranking first among nine bodies. A single drop of his blood could refine beast lineage, making it purer!

Crazed—entire Beast Domain was wild. Beasts and other domains’ remaining strongholds turned their eyes toward Luo Tian.

With treasures, he was now a delicacy—everyone wanted to kill him.

Emerging from the Ancient Heaven Palace, who knew what secrets he held? Another revelation: the Beast Domain’s eight major clans had issued a bounty, accusing Luo Tian of colluding with the Shura Domain and stealing the Epoch Book from the Holy City auction. The bounty for capturing Shura Domain members was now on Luo Tian, and the eight clans would send their elites to hunt him.

The Epoch Book, a pseudo-epoch treasure—both items were beyond imagination. Any faction would covet them.

Luo Tian was now truly at war with the world, with every sect and clan’s disciples eager to test his reincarnation body.

Older generations sought the pseudo-epoch treasures, vying to kill him.

Besides the four-star and Fire Domains, almost every domain had strongholds eyeing Luo Tian.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian’s enemies surfaced: sects and factions he’d offended rose to demand his head.

Yet a strange voice in the Beast Domain made some pause: the supreme elder of the beast clan, Diao Yuan, a half-epoch-level powerhouse—equivalent to a domain ruler—spoke out. Anyone daring to attack Luo Tian would face his wrath, especially older generations of late-stage divine beings.

Diao Yuan’s presence gave Luo Tian a powerful ally, halting some actions—both out of fear and shame at targeting a youth.

But the one who started this was Luo Tian, standing in the void, sensing three powerful auras lurking.

“Zing…” Luo Tian smiled, the Injuring Heaven Bow in his hand. He drew it, forming a powerful aura.

As the bow appeared, someone couldn’t hold back—golden light flashed in his vision.

“Little one, hand me the bow and I’ll let you live!” A late-stage divine being from an unknown domain demanded, his aura overwhelming.

“Get lost…” The arrow hummed, and Luo Tian spoke one word—his bowstring trembled. The golden arrow carried the Buddha’s Assault, vanishing from the bow.

“Boom…” Blood mist erupted—this late-stage divine being was obliterated, turning into a blood mist.

“Truly weak—compared to the Beast Domain’s late-stage divine beings, these freelancers are beneath contempt!” Luo Tian shook his head, gazing at the void. The bow returned to his hand.

“Little one, do you think you can be so arrogant without the pseudo-epoch treasure?” A cold voice echoed. Two late-stage divine beings appeared, their eyes icy as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“Boom…” The response was a black demon arrow, instantly annihilating the third late-stage divine being.

“But I still have the pseudo-epoch treasure!” Luo Tian’s eyes turned cold, gazing at the remaining one.

“You…” The last late-stage divine being trembled, fear in his eyes—Luo Tian still had the strength to draw the bow.

“Next is you!” Luo Tian no longer wasted words, drawing his bow. The remaining one had already begun to reform.

The golden divine arrow, like a reaper’s scythe, shot toward the late-stage divine being.

Against the Injuring Heaven Bow, even He Qingming couldn’t resist—how could this freelancer? The arrow tore through him, vanishing from Luo Tian’s sight.

He sheathed the bow—Luo Tian could only fire twelve arrows now. He didn’t want to use it unless necessary, as it was his last resort. As long as no apex divine beings appeared, he had no fear of late-stage ones.

“Zing…” The golden spear returned to his hand, his body glowing with gold as he charged toward the late-stage divine being who had just reformed. The spear pierced through the void, its power overwhelming. Under the Buddha’s Assault, it swept across the sky, striking the weakened opponent.
