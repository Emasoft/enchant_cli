The figures beneath them lay sprawled on the ground, their bodies bruised and battered. Though they had not perished, their condition was undeniably dire—especially the delicate girl whose wide, sorrowful eyes bore a vivid red handprint across her face. She clutched a young man clad in Daoist robes, his body motionless.

“Elephant Clan Leader, you are one of the Eight Sacred Clans. Though our Rhino Clan may not match your prestige, we hold standing within the Beast Domain. These are our guests—how dare you treat us with such contempt?” Xī Hóngdá gazed at the middle-aged man before him, his voice edged with accusation.

“Blasphemy! What are you? Daring to speak thus to me? Your Rhino Clan is nothing—do you think your fleeting fame in the Beast Domain grants you the right to challenge us, the Elephant and Crane Clans?” Before Xī Hóngdá could finish, the middle-aged man’s expression darkened, his voice laced with scorn.

“Old fool! You’re just a fat elephant!” Gǔ Léi, sprawled on the ground, barked back. “Don’t act tough—dare not confront Luò Tiān or Diāo Dézhù, but you come here to bully us? What kind of strength is that?”

“Exactly! Cowardly wretch, shameless old man. When I gain strength, I’ll rip your elephant trunk off to eat!” Zhèng Xīn joined in, her curses growing louder.

“Seems you two haven’t suffered enough yet!” A half-step Saint youth raised his palm, preparing to strike Zheng Xin’s mouth. But in an instant, a golden light flashed, slicing through the air with a tearing force. Even the Elephant Clan Leader, at Saint Mid-Stage, failed to react in time, his face paling.

The spear pierced the youth’s body—within moments, he exploded into a mist of blood, splattering Zheng Xin’s face.

L01

Chapter 1002: Trouble Arrives

In the Beast Domain’s Sacred City, within the Rhino Clan’s territory, a mist of blood drifted through the sky, causing all to gasp in horror.

The blood splattered onto Zheng Xin’s face, staining half her body red, her expression twisted with revulsion.

“Spit… spit! Damn it!” Zheng Xin ignored the stunned onlookers, continuing her curses.

“Killed well! Ha!” Gǔ Léi and the others laughed, their voices tinged with satisfaction. They gazed at the golden light embedded in the training ground, its presence radiating an awe-inspiring aura.

“Rending Sky Spear! Luò Tiān has returned!” Gǔ Léi’s group wore expressions of joy, but their faces darkened as they glanced at those who had wounded them.

The Elephant and Crane Clans’ leaders had arrived—both at Saint Mid-Stage, accompanied by several men at Saint Early-Stage. One among them was a Saint Late-Stage powerhouse, silent yet radiating an oppressive presence.

“Luò Tiān! You’ve finally returned!” The Elephant Clan Leader, a rotund middle-aged man, smiled warmly as Luò Tiān materialized as golden light before Dù Yùyíng.

“Luò Tiān, brother!” Dù Yùyíng’s face bore a touch of sorrow. Her red handprint nearly consumed her small face, with dried blood clinging to the corners of her lips—heart-wrenching.

Lù Tiānyǔ lay pale and motionless on Dù Yùyíng’s lap, his chest caved in, blood drenching his upper body.

A surge of killing intent erupted from Luò Tiān, his gaze sweeping over the figures before him. He extended a hand, releasing a surge of Saint Energy into Lù Tiānyǔ’s body. Though Luò Tiān had recovered most of his essence, the residual power of three Sacred Herbs still lingered in his Saint Energy, imbuing it with a faint green hue. As he gently wiped Dù Yùyíng’s tears, he whispered, “Don’t worry. I’ll avenge you.”

“Hey, kid—do you think the Sacred City is your private playground?” A half-step Saint youth stomped on Gǔ Léi’s chest, causing him to grimace. Though he wanted to curse back, he bit his tongue.

“Move your foot before I decide to chop it off!” Luò Tiān’s face was cold, his Rending Sky Spear in hand.

“Luò Tiān, I’m sorry! I couldn’t protect your friends!” Xī Hóngdá’s face bore a hint of regret as he addressed Luò Tiān.

“It’s fine,” Luò Tiān shook his head. He knew Xī Hóngdá hadn’t failed—after all, the Elephant and Crane Clans were part of the Eight Sacred Clans. If they clashed openly, the Rhino Clan would be seen as provoking the Eight, with dire consequences.

Luò Tiān bore no resentment toward Xī Hóngdá; if he were in the same situation, he wouldn’t risk his entire clan for strangers.

“You are Luò Tiān? You killed our two prodigies?” Two Saint Mid-Stage clan leaders glared at Luò Tiān, their expressions cold.

At the same time, Diāo Dézhù, Dù Hóngtāo, and Lù Hán tiān appeared on the training ground. When Dù Hóngtāo and Lù Hán tiān saw Dù Yùyíng and Lù Tiānyǔ’s pitiful state, their faces darkened. Their Saint Mid-Stage auras flared as they glared at the dozens of figures surrounding them.

“You say it is,” Luò Tiān shook his head, knowing further words were futile. These people had clearly come to provoke them. He lifted his spear, unrelenting, and struck the youth standing on Gǔ Léi’s chest. A cold tearing force pierced the youth’s skull.

“Boom…” Another mist of blood erupted, and a Crane Clan half-step Saint youth was slain.

“You… audacious…” The two clan leaders hadn’t expected Luò Tiān to openly kill their prodigies.

“Suffer, then!” Luò Tiān’s calm voice echoed as he helped Gǔ Léi up, tending to his wounds. Meanwhile, Nán gōng Yùqīng and others tended to Zheng Xin and Wàn Língkōng.

“Damn it, when I have time, I’ll set up a grand array outside your clans and refine you!” Wàn Língkōng spat out blood, threatening the two clan leaders.

“Luò Tiān, you’ve killed our two prodigies! This grudge is unresolvable!” The two clan leaders declared, their voices resolute.

“Spit! You’re not after revenge—just eyeing their treasures, right? Find an excuse to steal them!” Diāo Dézhù cursed, unafraid in the Beast Domain.

“Diāo Dézhù, for your grandfather’s sake, we’ll overlook this. Leave now—this isn’t your affair. Go back home!” The two clan leaders’ faces shifted slightly, but their tone remained domineering.

“Ha! What if I don’t leave?” Diāo Dézhù crossed his arms, smirking. His Saint Early-Stage aura flared.

“Saint Early-Stage!” The two clan leaders’ faces shifted slightly. If Diāo Dézhù were still a half-step Saint, they could subdue him and deliver him to Diāo Yuánshān later. But now, with his Saint Early-Stage power, subduing him was impossible. If they injured him, Diāo Yuánshān would never forgive them.

“Come on! Let’s fight eight hundred battles!” Diāo Dézhù roared, his excitement rising. Having returned to the Beast Domain and ascended to Saint Early-Stage, he imagined Diāo Yuánshān’s praise.

“Then I have no choice but to offend you,” the late-stage Crane Clan elder finally spoke, his eyes opening. He gazed at Diāo Dézhù before extending a hand, summoning a white palm toward him.

At the same time, his late-stage Saint aura surged, causing everyone to pause slightly. Though Diāo Dézhù was a Saint Early-Stage prodigy, his gap against the late-stage elder was immense. Even a mid-stage Saint would struggle against him, let alone a late-stage one from the Eight Sacred Clans.

“Hè Qīngmíng! You dare!” Diāo Dézhù recognized the elder.

The white palm seemed light, like a feather, but its power was unmistakable.

The void cracked as the palm appeared above Diāo Dézhù’s head, causing him to shudder. His thin body straightened, his face bearing a wistful expression: “I’ll stand here and let you kill me. Do you dare?”

“Dare? No, but I can trap you!” Hè Qīngmíng smiled.

His words trailed off as the white palm transformed into a white crane, encasing Diāo Dézhù within its form.

“Enough. Let’s deal with you now,” Hè Qīngmíng rose, his aura surging. White light radiated from him, pressing upon Luò Tiān’s group.

The group’s brows furrowed as they gazed at the elder, their expressions grave.

The Elephant and Crane Clans’ members smiled, greedily eyeing Luò Tiān.

“Kid, I heard you’re a Reincarnation Body. Oh, rare indeed! Hand over the Epoch Bell, and I’ll spare your life. I’ll keep you caged like an animal, using your blood to elevate our Crane Clan’s lineage. In under a century, we’ll surpass the Eight Sacred Clans!” Hè Qīngmíng’s ancient eyes gleamed, regarding Luò Tiān as a treasure.

“Old dog!” Xú Lìzī and others gritted their teeth, glaring at Hè Qīngmíng. Though their strength had improved, they could match this elder alone.

“Do you think you can dominate us so easily?” Luò Tiān remained calm, his eyes unflinching.

“Kid, do you think anyone in the Beast Domain will protect you now?” The Crane Clan Leader sneered.

“Hè Zhǎnpéng! Xióng Dàlì, if anything happens to my friends, I’ll bring my grandfather to your clans tomorrow!” Diāo Dézhù dodged the crane’s form, his voice echoing.

“Hmph.” Hè Qīngmíng inwardly snorted. If he obtained the fake Epoch Bell and handed it to his clan’s elder, even Diāo Yuánshān would be unable to confront him. Though Diāo Yuánshān was formidable, he could only cause chaos within the Crane Clan. This was the disadvantage of being a small clan.

“Kill…” The elder’s eyes flashed coldly, commanding the surrounding figures to attack. His body transformed into a streak of white light, rushing toward Luò Tiān.

“Don’t hold back—kill!” Luò Tiān smiled, the sound of waves echoing from his dantian. His body soared into the sky.

“Boom…” The white crane form shattered, and Diāo Dézhù burst forth like a streak of purple lightning, charging toward Hè Qīngmíng.

“Roar…” A dragon’s cry echoed as a golden dragon, stretching over a hundred feet, materialized in the sky. A commanding aura of submission to all things radiated from its golden scales.

L01

Chapter 1003: Four Heavenly Prodigies

Above the Rhino Clan’s territory, a golden dragon coiled over the training ground. Its golden scales shimmered with cold light, and its golden eyes radiated a ruthless aura. The overwhelming pressure immediately affected every beast.

“This…” Hè Qīngmíng’s face bore a hint of fear, his blood momentarily halting. The intense lineage pressure was difficult for him to adapt to.

Even a late-stage Saint would feel this, let alone others. Long Jiē had now reached Saint Early-Stage, meaning that beasts below Saint Early-Stage were mere ants before him. Even their lineage pressure was unbearable.

The Rhino Clan’s people bowed in reverence, trembling as they gazed at the golden dragon above. Though they had seen Long Jiē’s true form before, it was then a half-step Saint. Now, in their eyes, he was more terrifying than before.

Beasts of the Bear and Crane Clans below Saint Early-Stage were drenched in sweat, standing motionless. Though they didn’t kneel, their bodies trembled with fear.

Xióng Dàlì and Hè Zhǎnpéng also shifted slightly, though their movements weren’t restricted. They still felt a drop in power.

“Do you truly understand us? Are you being manipulated by others, acting as their pawns?” Luò Tiān held his spear, smiling as he addressed the three remaining fighters.

“Who are you, with such a dense dragon lineage?” Hè Qīngmíng’s face bore fear as he gazed at Long Jiē.

“My name is Long Jiē. In my past life, you all called me Long Zhàntiān!” Long Jiē spoke solemnly, his voice cold. His massive dragon tail lashed toward Hè Qīngmíng.

Long Jiē’s words sent waves through the crowd, their eyes wide with disbelief. This was the first time Long Jiē had revealed his lineage in the Beast Domain, and he used his past life’s name.

The name “Long Zhàntiān” was legendary, and its impact on the crowd was immeasurable. Even Hè Qīngmíng was stunned, for the name was too renowned.

In that moment of Hè Qīngmíng’s distraction, Long Jiē’s dragon tail cracked the void, striking Hè Qīngmíng and sending him retreating. His body emitted a crackling sound.

“Even so, one of me is enough!” Hè Qīngmíng retreated but realized why his clan’s elder had sent him.

“Kill!” Golden light surged as the golden spear reappeared, slicing through the air with a mournful sound. It directly targeted Hè Qīngmíng’s throat.

“Saint Early-Stage? How dare you attack me! You seek death!” Hè Qīngmíng’s eyes flashed coldly, showing no intent to dodge. He grabbed the golden spear with his hand, stepping back two paces. Yet the sharp tip of the spear did not pierce his throat.

“Return!” Hè Qīngmíng extended his hand, striking Luò Tiān before him. A mountain-moving aura instantly made Luò Tiān’s face shift, but it was too late to escape.

“Boom…” A bell sound rang as a golden ancient bell, resembling copper chimes, flew from Luò Tiān’s hair. Golden light enveloped him, with runes flickering.

“Boom…” The white palm collided with the golden light, and Luò Tiān felt a thunderous sound in his ears. His blood surged violently as he was pushed back.

A torrent of blood qi roared forward, a crimson sword with overwhelming power flying from Hè Qīngmíng’s back to strike his heart. Meanwhile, Diāo Dézhù transformed into his true form, a streak of purple lightning. Using the ultimate technique “幽冥鬼步” (Yōu Míng Guǐbù), he caught Hè Qīngmíng off guard, biting into his flesh. Blood gushed from Hè Qīngmíng’s back.

“Crack…” Nán Gōng Yùqīng’s face darkened as the crimson sword struck Hè Qīngmíng, but it left only a shallow wound. It was no real harm.

“Saint Late-Stage truly is powerful!” Luò Tiān, Nán Gōng Yùqīng, and Diāo Dézhù gathered together, their expressions grave.

“You are prodigies, but still Saint Early-Stage—too young yet!” Hè Qīngmíng smiled, gazing at the three.

Meanwhile, another battle had begun. Lù Hán tiān and Dù Hóngtāo, now both Saint Mid-Stage, had instinctively found Xióng Dàlì and Hè Zhǎnpéng.

The sound of Saint Mid-Stage combat echoed continuously, with the void constantly churning under their attacks. Yet no sound emerged from the Rhino Clan’s territory, as both clans had prepared extensively, using arrays to seal the entire Rhino Clan.

“Haha! Kid, that kick felt great!” Gǔ Léi laughed, pulling out a colorful pill and shoving it into a Crane Clan half-step Saint’s mouth.

The half-step Saint grimaced, realizing he could have killed Gǔ Léi before but now was helpless under Long Jiē’s pressure. This feeling was worse than eating excrement.

“Gǔ Léi, don’t mess with your pills—these are precious! They’re nourishing. You’ll be responsible for detoxifying them. If not, the battle will follow you from now on, and I’ll let you feed these people. They’re all the battle’s provisions!” Xú Lìzī swung his hands, beating a Bear Clan Saint Early-Stage’s face.

Others also reveled in tormenting the helpless clan members, even Dù Yùyíng was not spared. She kicked a猥琐 (wěizuǒ) Crane Clan youth repeatedly, muttering as she did.

Above, Hè Qīngmíng’s face darkened, his expression deep. Yet he could do nothing—Long Jiē’s lineage was crushing them. If Long Jiē were Saint Late-Stage, he would be one of his juniors.

“Can’t leave. My elder’s intent was clearly this!” Hè Qīngmíng thought, his body gradually fading. His aura surged again as he waved his hands, sending a white seal flying from his palm.

“White Crane Seal!” He roared, forgetting Luò Tiān and Nán Gōng Yùqīng. He transformed into a white line, rushing toward Long Jiē.

“Want to leave?” Luò Tiān wouldn’t let Hè Qīngmíng escape so easily. He stepped into the “幽冥鬼步” (Yōu Míng Guǐbù), his hands moving as a golden seal flew from the void toward Hè Qīngmíng’s path.

Nán Gōng Yùqīng also hurled his sword, its countless blades sealing Hè Qīngmíng’s escape.

Diāo Dézhù shook his small body, but each purple hair turned into a steel needle, flying toward Hè Qīngmíng.

“Boom…” The two seals collided in the sky, causing the Rhino Clan’s people to pale. Both sides were ancestors; they dared not offend either, only watching the two factions clash.

At the same time, a blood-red magic array formed, trapping Hè Qīngmíng within it. Blood-red swords hovered in the sky before forming a river of blood, rushing toward Hè Qīngmíng.

“Break!” Hè Qīngmíng’s face showed no fear, but he had secretly obtained a white feather fan. He waved it, creating an invisible storm that collided with the blood river.

In an instant, the river reversed into the void, and the blood swords fell into Nán Gōng Yùqīng’s hands.

The only effective part was Diāo Dézhù’s purple hairs, all piercing Hè Qīngmíng’s body. He looked like a porcupine, but still no harm was done.

Hè Qīngmíng’s body trembled, and the purple needles flew back, sweeping across the sky. Several Rhino Clan’s Supreme Stage individuals were struck, some even dying.

“Truly strong—Saint Late-Stage is unbeatable! Even the four prodigies couldn’t subdue this Saint Late-Stage, especially since Long Jiē had previously defeated a Saint Mid-Stage!” Xú Lìzī and others who had entered the Ancient Heaven Palace sighed, gazing at the battle in the sky.

“Enter the abyss!” Luò Tiān and Nán Gōng Yùqīng spoke in unison, their bodies shrouded in black qi. Their power surged again, nearly reaching Saint Mid-Stage.

“Damn it! I’ll kill this old bastard today—I can brag about it for ten years!” Diāo Dézhù’s face showed madness, his small claws slashing through the void.

“Diāo Xíng Tiānxià!” Diāo Dézhù’s black eyes flashed madness. His sharp fangs grew, and his body swelled, transforming into a primordial beast. His eyes turned blood-red.

“Kill!” The three’s speed and power surged greatly, forming three torrents of energy rushing toward Hè Qīngmíng. Long Jiē also radiated battle intent, his golden body rolling as he spat out a river of royal dragon qi. This river was composed entirely of the Emperor’s Dragon Qi, its power overwhelming enough to wound or even kill a Saint Mid-Stage.

“Indeed, the four heavenly prodigies are no ordinary!” Hè Qīngmíng felt a surge of danger, his eyes turning grave.

Yet Hè Qīngmíng still showed no fear; the four’s desperate attack merely made him cautious.

His white palm, like jade, sent out hand seals. At the same time, he seemed to be bathed in holy light, with white feathers drifting around him.

L01

Chapter 1004: The Heaven-Defying Bow

In the Beast Domain’s Sacred City, within the Rhino Clan’s territory, the late-stage Crane Clan elder bore confidence. He waved his hand, sending out white feathers that seemed gentle but exerted immense pressure on Luò Tiān and his group. Even Long Jiē, with his aura, wore a grave expression.

“Four Heavenly Prodigies fighting a Saint Late-Stage! If they can defeat this saint, their names will echo across the Nine Realms. Who else could achieve such a feat?” The Rhino Clan’s people marveled, their eyes filled with reverence as they gazed at the four figures radiating powerful auras.

“Kill!” Black magic blades凝聚 (congregated), and Nán Gōng Yùqīng and Luò Tiān’s bodies were shrouded in black qi. Their swords slashed through the sky, as if splitting heaven and earth, striking the elder directly. They had both unleashed their seventh blade of Seven Magic Blades, its power boundless.

“Powerful!” The crowd watched the blades, their hearts trembling. They had known the two’s strength was extraordinary but now felt a shudder at their display, as if they could withstand Saint Mid-Stage opponents.

“Yōu Míng Guǐzhǎo!” Diāo Dézhù roared, unleashing his secret technique. His sharp claws flew from his true form of the “Yōu Míng Guǐ Diāo” (幽冥鬼貂), slicing through the void toward the elder.

“Roar!” A golden dragon roared, and Long Jiē let out a roar, transforming from his true form into human form. He stood in the void, holding a golden bow that shimmered with radiant light. His eyes were cold.

Drawing the bow, he transformed Emperor Dragon Qi into a golden sword, which he placed on the golden bowstring.

“That’s it! The fake Epoch Bell from the auction!” People gasped, watching Long Jiē’s golden bow that radiated dazzling light.

“Shāng Tiān Bow! The one used by the Divine Clan to exchange for the Immortal Life Bamboo. How did it end up in his hands!” Someone exclaimed, surprised to see the Shāng Tiān Bow from the auction.

“Hear it was forged by the Divine Clan’s old god-king when his blood was strong. Its power is immense. It was with this bow that the Divine Clan’s old god-king survived the Epoch Cataclysm, though he didn’t ascend to the Epoch Stage. He still lived and became a half-Epoch powerhouse. Hence, it was named the Shāng Tiān Bow. If fully activated, even Heaven itself could be wounded!” People recalled the bow’s origin, their faces filled with awe.

“Haha! Hè Qīngmíng, you old dog—now that you have the fake Epoch Bell, how long will you gloat?” Diāo Dézhù laughed wildly, his eyes on the Crane Clan elder surrounded by white feathers.

“Danger!” Upon Long Jiē revealing the Shāng Tiān Bow, Hè Qīngmíng’s face shifted slightly. Though Luò Tiān also had the Epoch Bell, he could sense it was defensive in nature. Though it posed a threat, it wasn’t fatal. But this Shāng Tiān Bow was an offensive weapon—careless, even he could be destroyed.

In Hè Qīngmíng’s momentary distraction, Luò Tiān and the others’ attacks surged with overwhelming power, shaking the heavens as they rushed toward Hè Qīngmíng.

“Diāo Dézhù, now I advise you to step back from this contest. Otherwise, I’ll have to teach your junior a lesson for you,” Hè Qīngmíng spoke solemnly, his holy light intensifying.

“Hè Qiānshā!” Hè Qīngmíng felt the threat of their attacks, his face shifting. He formed a supreme hand seal with both hands. The previously gentle feathers around him suddenly radiated sharpness, each one terrifying, slicing through the void and merging into a storm of terror that rushed toward their attacks.

“Buzz…” A piercing hum echoed in the crowd’s ears, even from tens of thousands of feet away. The two terrifying storms clashed above the Rhino Clan’s territory.

“Puke…” Luò Tiān, Diāo Dézhù, and Nán Gōng Yùqīng’s faces turned pale as they spat blood.

They gazed at the endless storm of white feathers, which interwove and annihilated their techniques. The three suffered backlash.

Nearby, Lù Hán tiān and Dù Hóngtāo were also clashing with Xióng Dàlì and Hè Zhǎnpéng. Both sides sought to quickly eliminate the other, so their attacks were ruthless and fatal.

But when Luò Tiān’s group faced this storm, Lù Hán tiān and Dù Hóngtāo also felt its impact. They instinctively halted their attacks, gazing at the holy light storm.

“Haha! See? This is a Saint Late-Stage’s power—destroying everything. How could your small Fire Domain and Four Sacred Domains compare?” Xióng Dàlì spoke loudly, his voice tinged with pride. Though he was awed by Luò Tiān’s strength, after seeing their techniques annihilated, he spoke mockingly.

Lù Hán tiān and Dù Hóngtāo’s faces darkened. They had felt the Saint Late-Stage elder’s power, but they were desperate. Only by defeating these two could they regroup with Luò Tiān’s group to confront Hè Qīngmíng.

Realizing this, their hands flashed with intent—clearly ready to fight to the death. They knew time was against them; if this Saint Late-Stage won, none would survive.

“Excellent. You’ve withstood my attack and only suffered backlash—your worth is undeniable. If you had grown into a Saint Late-Stage, I might not have been your match. But alas, you’ve yet to mature,” Hè Qīngmíng smiled, gazing at Luò Tiān and the others. His words were sincere; in the Beast Domain, people respected strength.

Yet Hè Qīngmíng’s subordinates showed no mercy, their hands flashing again. The storm continued to surge toward Luò Tiān and the others.

“Old dog, have you forgotten me?” A clear voice echoed as Long Jiē’s long hair flew. His Shāng Tiān Bow radiated intense light, illuminating the sky with a terrifying aura.

Golden Emperor Dragon Qi surged with overwhelming power, forming an unbreakable arrow on the Shāng Tiān Bow. The runes flowed into the golden Emperor Dragon Arrow.

“Break…” The clear sound of the bowstring echoed, causing Hè Qīngmíng’s face to shift. A life-threatening danger made his hair stand on end.

“Roar…” The golden Emperor Dragon Arrow, radiating overwhelming power, vanished from the bowstring and rushed toward the elder as a lifelike golden dragon.

“Return!” The life-threatening danger made Hè Qīngmíng abandon attacking Luò Tiān and others. He grabbed the white storm, pulling it back to his front. At the same time, the white feathers instantly moved, forming a ball of light that encased Hè Qīngmíng.

Meanwhile, the Emperor Dragon Arrow instantly arrived and pierced into the light ball.

“Crack…” Like a thunderclap, it caused the Rhino Clan’s people to bleed from their ears. Even Luò Tiān and Nán Gōng Yùqīng nearly flew off, their minds filled with thunderous echoes.

“Did it block?” Their faces darkened as they watched the Emperor Dragon Arrow pierce into the white barrier. They hoped that even a fake Epoch Bell couldn’t harm him, or it would be a disgrace for the fake.

The barrier shattered—despite being a Saint Late-Stage defense, it couldn’t withstand the Emperor Dragon Arrow’s might. In an instant, it pierced through and rushed toward Hè Qīngmíng.

“Puke…” Blood splattered, and half of Hè Qīngmíng’s body exploded into a mist of blood.

“Damn it!” Hè Qīngmíng growled, quickly regenerating his body. His eyes flashed with endless coldness.

“How many years has it been since someone wounded me this severely? You are the first!” Hè Qīngmíng’s face darkened as he gazed at the four, finally settling on Long Jiē.

“Fake Epoch Bell—this is truly terrifying! My grandfather was too biased, giving this to Long Jiē without a second thought!” Diāo Dézhù sighed, muttering with dissatisfaction.

“Enough—let’s finish this old man first!” Luò Tiān’s face bore a bitter expression as he gazed at Hè Qīngmíng, who had quickly regenerated.

Though the elder was wounded, his cultivation hadn’t dropped—he remained a true Saint Late-Stage powerhouse.

“Haha! How many more arrows can you fire? A fake Epoch Bell isn’t something you can endlessly activate!” Hè Qīngmíng sneered, gazing at Long Jiē’s pale face. His body transformed into a streak of light while a crane-shaped shadow formed around him.

“Damn it!” Luò Tiān’s brows furrowed as he watched Long Jiē’s pale face. He stepped into the “Yōu Míng Guǐbù” (幽冥鬼步), rushing toward the elder. He felt Long Jiē was weakened, clearly drained by the Shāng Tiān Bow’s power.

Nán Gōng Yùqīng and Diāo Dézhù’s expressions also shifted. Three figures—black, red, and gold—rushed toward the elder again.

“Kill!”

Though Long Jiē was greatly drained, his face still bore arrogance. He transformed into a streak of gold light, forming an encircling attack with Luò Tiān and the others.

“Haha! It’s no use—too great a gap!” Hè Qīngmíng remained fearless, his hands forming martial techniques. He faced the four’s attacks with calmness and boldness, clashing with them in a fierce battle.

The sound of explosions rose again into the sky, and invisible waves constantly spread, causing everyone on the ground to tremble.

L01

Chapter 1005: Killing a Saint Mid-Stage

In the Beast Domain’s Sacred City, on the surface it was tranquil, but no one knew that a colossal battle raged within the Rhino Clan’s territory. Four Saint Early-Stage warriors were clashing with a Saint Late-Stage opponent, and if they succeeded, their feat would be legendary.

Luò Tiān’s group wore blood-stained robes, their bodies constantly clashing with Hè Qīngmíng. Their flesh was unbreakable, forcing even Hè Qīngmíng to be cautious.

Especially Luò Tiān and Long Jiē, their coordination was seamless, as if they shared a single mind. Luò Tiān’s “Fàn Tiān Attack” was terrifying, its power equivalent to five Luò Tiāns attacking simultaneously. He had mastered the attack’s peak.

“Kill!” Hè Qīngmíng’s face darkened, also suffering heavy injuries. Long Jiē’s previous arrow had wounded him severely, and the pressure of Long Jiē’s lineage further reduced his strength.

The four clashed endlessly, turning the sky above the Rhino Clan’s territory upside down. The entire area was reduced to a wasteland, and if not for the Sacred City’s strength, it would have been completely destroyed.

“Boom…” Hè Qīngmíng seemed to target Long Jiē, attacking him more than others. Long Jiē bore most of the pressure.

But Long Jiē was only Saint Early-Stage, and though he had defeated a Saint Mid-Stage before, Hè Qīngmíng was a true Saint Late-Stage powerhouse—vastly superior.

If not for Long Jiē’s strong body, he might have already been reduced to dust. His overexertion left him pale as Hè Qīngmíng struck him with a punch, sending him plummeting to the ground. Blood gushed from his mouth, splattering into the earth.

“Long Jiē!” Luò Tiān and the others’ eyes turned red as they blocked Hè Qīngmíng’s attempt to kill Long Jiē.

“Haha, good! I’ll finish you three first, then deal with this kid!” Hè Qīngmíng spat blood. He had been struck by Luò Tiān and the others as well.
