“Who among you will grasp a transcendent martial skill or scripture this time?” Duan Hongsheng smiled slightly as he gazed at the two hundred plus figures on the luminous screen above.

“I hope someone will craft an Earth-level martial skill or uncover a world-shattering scripture. I recall that the Greenwood Emperor’s Scripture of your Yuling Sect was discovered by one of your sect's masters,” Duan Chenfeng said, his expression filled with admiration as he looked at Leng Hongcai.

The Greenwood Emperor’s Scripture had become Yuling Sect's most treasured art, accessible only to direct disciples and passed down through generations.

“Creating martial skills relates greatly to one's character. Those with broad-mindedness often craft skills of similar breadth, while those with narrow minds tend to create extreme techniques,” Leng Hongcai said with a smile.

“Hmph?” The master of the Flame Sect looked surprised, his gaze turning toward Ding Xiaoyan.

At that moment, a crimson glow radiated from the stone tablet before Ding Xiaoyan. She closed her eyes tightly, and waves of red energy enveloped her body.

“Boom…” The crimson stone tablet exploded violently, rising like a bamboo pole into the sky.

In another direction, Su Yeyu suddenly opened her eyes, confusion flickering across her face before her stone tablet also erupted with a thunderous roar.

Not just them, most others' stone tablets emitted various fluctuations.

Three days passed. Luotian remained seated before his tablet, eyes closed. Meanwhile, earth-shaking noises erupted from the other participants in the cultivation space.

A hundred-zhang-high stone tablet suddenly surged upward before a pale-faced youth.

“Someone has completed it?” Onlookers on the high platform turned their gazes toward the screen.

“Haha! I've grasped it—The Lost Wind Scripture of the Sky-Devouring! I've created the Residual Gold Demon Slash!” A pale youth laughed loudly, gazing at a hundred-zhang-high stone tablet before him with joy.

“This man was previously unknown, yet he completed it the fastest. That's rare! He'll surely draw the most attention now,” people murmured, some sect masters directing their gazes toward the youth.

Before the youth's laughter faded, another thunderous roar erupted. Stone tablets shot up one after another, but none reached over a thousand zhang in height.

In the following days, more participants emerged from the cultivation space. The shortest tablet stood at thirty zhang while the tallest reached nine hundred zhang, stunning everyone. Some sect masters began inviting those who emerged.

Yet the Three Major Sects and several other large sects remained still, their gazes fixed on the remaining dozens in the cultivation space.

On the fifteenth day, a deafening roar echoed from the cultivation space, surpassing all previous sounds.

“Ten zhang… one hundred zhang… a thousand zhang… two thousand five hundred zhang!” In awe, the stone tablet suddenly soared to two thousand five hundred zhang.

This tablet outshone all others, seeming the sole pillar in the world.

“Ice-Fire Dual Principles Scripture!” Ding Xiaoyan's face bore a hint of pride as she clenched her jade fist, pressing both hands into the ground of the cultivation space.

“Crack…” Two fissures split open under everyone's astonished gaze.

“This woman is a rare talent with both ice and fire attributes. She remained low-key until now, but she's finally burst forth!” People murmured, watching Ding Xiaoyan and her two thousand five hundred zhang tablet.

“This woman is suitable for our Lan Ting Dao. I hope the other sect masters won't vie with me over her!” An old woman, her eyes glowing, gazed at Ding Xiaoyan.

“Lan Ting Dao may not match the Three Major Sects, but within Kunlun Mountain it's among the top sects. I never expected this woman to be noticed by Lan Ting Dao!” People looked at the old woman with reverence.

As if reaching a threshold, while people were still in awe of Ding Xiaoyan's two thousand five hundred zhang tablet, the remaining dozens' stone tablets erupted again.

“Boom…!” Like rolling thunder, towering stone tablets continuously rose.

Their only common trait was exceeding a thousand zhang. Some surpassed two thousand, even three and four thousand zhang.

Su Yeyu wore a bewildered expression as she lightly touched her high stone tablet with jade hands. Brown spiritual energy coiled around them. The two thousand zhang tablet suddenly extended another six hundred zhang.

This sight filled the onlookers outside with wonder. They had never seen anyone make a stone tablet rise an additional six hundred zhang after it had stabilized.

“What martial skill did this woman cultivate? What scripture did she uncover to make the tablet tremble again?” This woman had been unknown before, but now her brilliance was undeniable.

“What scripture did you cultivate? What martial skill did you create?” A middle-aged woman, her cultivation at the Nascent Soul stage, asked.

“Thick Earth Scripture!”

“Sealing Earth Palm… I feel it's around the High Intermediate level of the Martial Skill,” Su Yeyu mused before speaking softly.

“Thick Earth Scripture! That's our Sect of Mountain and Sea's inherited scripture. Will you join us, Sect Master?” The woman's face lit up with joy as she extended an invitation.

“Latecomer is willing!”

“Good!” The woman waved her hand, and Su Yeyu levitated off the ground, as if a celestial maiden from nine heavens, arriving before the woman. Other sect masters who had planned to invite Su Yeyu looked regretful, sighing inwardly that they'd arrived too late.

Chapter 358: All Explosions()

Chapter 358: All Explosions

“Those two women—Su Yeyu and Ding Xiaoyan—are both children of city lords from the secular world!” Someone recalled their identities, speaking in murmurs.

While people discussed them, Huo Zhiyong wore a pleased expression because his stone tablet was the highest among this batch.

“Four thousand two hundred zhang! Is this man also from the secular world?” People marveled, gazing at Huo Zhiyong's stone tablet.

“This Huo Zhiyong has the worst talent, only a single fire attribute body type. Yet his insight is the highest!” Zhao Hongsheng spoke, his face showing interest as he gazed at Huo Zhiyong, hinting a desire to recruit him.

Talent is crucial for someone, but after reaching a certain level, insight surpasses talent. These three had been stuck at the Nascent Soul peak for years without entering the Soul-Ember realm because of insufficient insight. Thus, even Zhao Hongsheng and his companions felt a desire to recruit the one who could raise a four thousand two hundred zhang stone tablet.

Four thousand two hundred zhang had far surpassed many Kunlun Mountain native geniuses.

“Unexpectedly, the outside world has produced several remarkable individuals this time!” Leng Hongcai spoke, his eyes carrying a smile.

“Haha… What's your name? Never mind the name. Will you join my Red Flame Sect? I guarantee you'll be my Red Flame Master's disciple upon entering!” A red-haired elder smiled joyfully, speaking loudly.

“Latecomer is willing!” Huo Zhiyong naturally knew of the Red Flame Sect. Within Kunlun Mountain, this sect specialized in recruiting fire attribute talents—perfect for him. He bowed slightly and accepted.

“Hmph, I never expected this old man to snatch the lead!” Duan Chenfeng frowned.

“Why don't you go fight for it?” Zhao Hongsheng said playfully.

“If you want to, but the Red Flame Sect's people are all madmen. I'm afraid those madmen would stir up chaos in my Sky-Sword Sect!” Duan Chenfeng's lips twitched.

The Red Flame Sect was also renowned within Kunlun Mountain. Just seeing the Sky-Sword Sect's master fear it so much, one could tell this sect was no ordinary group.

After the three, many others were also recruited by various sects without leaving a single one behind.

At this point, only a few remained in the cultivation space. Including Luotian, there were five people left—Leng Qiuchan, Zheng Xin, and Duan Xingchen among them.

People felt tense watching the six seated in the cultivation space. Those who had cultivated for so long must have discovered world-shattering scriptures and created martial skills.

Luotian was now surrounded by green vitality, his entire body seemingly merged with it. He listened carefully, as if hearing the voices of every plant and tree.

From the surrounding plants came a continuous stream of pleasant notes entering Luotian's ears, as if the trees whispered in his ear.

“Greenwood Emperor’s Scripture! I never expected to grasp this scripture here!” Luotian opened his eyes, gently touching a nearby blade of grass with a smile.

At the moment Luotian opened his eyes in the stone tablet, the tablet before his body suddenly radiated boundless green vitality. The entire cultivation space was instantly filled with life.

“This!” Leng Hongcai's face showed intense shock, gazing at Luotian's green tablet with excitement.

“I once heard that when Yuling Sect’s ancient ancestor cultivated the Greenwood Emperor’s Scripture, the tablet was also filled with vitality spreading throughout the cultivation space. Could it be that this boy…” Zhao Hongsheng and Duan Chenfeng also showed intense shock.

“Greenwood Emperor’s Scripture!” Leng Hongcai forced down his excitement, speaking softly. Yet everyone could hear the faint tremor in his voice.

“Who is this boy? What did he grasp that made the Three Major Sects' masters show such expressions!” People looked at him with intense disbelief.

“His tablet hasn't risen yet, meaning he just completed the scripture. How strong must his insight be!”

“I remember this is that youth who reached the Bone-Transcending realm with only nine-body cultivation! He was called Luolei!” People murmured, beginning to recognize Luotian.

“First phase he was renowned. Now in the second phase, he's still like this!” People's faces bore admiration, even the masters seated on the high platform showed similar expressions.

“I heard this Greenwood Emperor’s Scripture and the Sealing Soul Steps are both Yuling Sect's treasured arts. I never thought I'd master them!” Luotian mused inwardly, unaware that the outside world had already been stunned by him.

A thunderous roar echoed. Luotian's scene before him suddenly changed, a wave of bloodiness spreading around him. The surrounding plants withered instantly. Luotian felt as if he had arrived at a vast ancient battlefield, standing amidst corpses and blood.

“This… death energy!” Luotian's eyes showed solemnity. The previous gentleness abruptly changed, blood sticky enough to soak his robe, and waves of death energy surrounded him again.

Luotian's face bore solemnity as he gazed at the lifeless illusion around him, his eyes showing thoughts.

“Life… death…” Luotian murmured, his eyes flashing with light. He closed his eyes and sat in meditation.

At the moment Luotian meditated, a thunderous roar echoed from a youth wearing blue robes ten zhang away. Though the robe was blue, it had been stained red with blood—evidence of his battle for a spot in the first phase.

“Boom…!” A deep sound echoed within the space.

“Another has succeeded!” People eagerly watched the rising stone tablet before the blue-robed youth, shouting.

“One hundred zhang… one thousand zhang… three thousand zhang… six thousand four hundred zhang!” People's eyes showed shock, silently measuring the tablet’s height.

“Six thousand four hundred zhang… this person is transcendent! Such insight would even make the Three Major Sects vie for him. Upon entering a sect, he'd definitely be a direct disciple!”

“Who is this person? He must not be unknown within Kunlun Mountain!”

“I wonder what scripture he cultivated and what transcendent martial skill he created. Could it be an Earth-level one?” Someone shouted.

Chapter 359: There's Still One Person()

Chapter 359: There's Still One Person!

“What's your name?” Duan Chenfeng asked, his face showing a kind smile as he addressed the youth.

“Jing Honghui!” The youth didn't show courtesy despite being addressed by the Sky-Sword Sect's master. His face remained calm as he gazed at Duan Chenfeng.

“What scripture did you cultivate? What martial skill did you create?” Duan Chenfeng asked, looking at Jing Honghui.

“Water Demon Slash. It's around the initial stage of an Earth-level martial skill!” Jing Honghui spoke, his gaze cold.

“Hiss… Earth-level!” People were stunned. They never expected someone to create an Earth-level martial skill, and their gazes toward Jing Honghui now carried respect.

“Will you join my Sky-Sword Sect?” Duan Chenfeng extended an invitation.

“I also welcome you to my Wind-Seeking Valley!” Duan Chenfeng's words had barely finished when Zhao Hongsheng smiled and approached.

“Ah… I won't compete with you!” Leng Hongcai spoke, rubbing his beard.

“The Three Major Sects have started to act!” People's faces bore admiration. The ability to raise a six thousand four hundred zhang tablet had made the Three Major Sects envious, and they began to compete.

“Old Zhao, do me a favor. I like this kid's personality!” Duan Chenfeng looked at Jing Honghui with satisfaction.

“Fine, fine! Since you've spoken, I'll give you this favor!” Zhao Hongsheng frowned.

“Thank you!” Duan Chenfeng bowed to Zhao Hongsheng, then turned back to Jing Honghui and continued: “Boy, join my Sky-Sword Sect. I'll take you as my disciple!”

Jing Honghui's face showed no expression. His feet pushed off the ground, and his body leaped like a leopard onto the platform, standing behind Duan Chenfeng.

“Congratulations!” Zhao Hongsheng laughed loudly and addressed Duan Chenfeng, then turned his gaze back to the cultivation space.

Duan Chenfeng smiled slightly and refocused on the cultivation space. At this moment, thunderous roars echoed again, not just from one place.

“Four places simultaneously!” People's faces showed shock as they gazed at the four stone tablets in the cultivation space, growing rapidly like bamboo shoots after rain.

“One thousand zhang… three thousand zhang… six thousand zhang…” People silently counted the height of the stone tablets.

“These four people are definitely among the top geniuses of this era. Such transcendent insight is rare across the Tianyuan Continent!”

“Zheng Xin, Leng Qiuchan, and Duan Xingchen are understandable. But who is this person? He has the strength to rival them!” People's faces bore admiration, not for Leng Qiuchan and others but for the unassuming, thin youth.

The four stone tablets grew rapidly, seemingly tireless, deeply shaking people's hearts.

“Zheng Xin’s tablet stopped at eight thousand zhang. No wonder he's a genius of the Wind-Seeking Valley. His insight is already rare…” People marveled at Zheng Xin's tablet.

But they were soon drawn to the other three tablets, their faces showing eagerness. Leng Qiuchan, Duan Xingchen, and the youth's tablets continued to grow slowly but steadily upward.

“Leng Qiuchan’s tablet stopped at eight thousand five hundred zhang, and Duan Xingchen's reached eight thousand seven hundred zhang!”

“The most terrifying is this youth. Who is he? How could he still be rising? I wonder if he can break through to nine thousand zhang. It's said that the most successful among Yuling Sect’s ancestors reached nine thousand one hundred zhang. If he breaks through to nine thousand zhang, he'll definitely be fiercely competed for by the Three Major Sects!” People's faces bore anticipation.

Leng Qiuchan and others also gazed solemnly at the youth. They never expected to be surpassed by an unassuming one.

At this moment, people seemed to have forgotten Luotian. Only the Three Major Sects' masters occasionally glanced at him, expecting what martial skill he would create. They knew that having cultivated the Greenwood Emperor’s Scripture, Luotian's insight was definitely no weakling.

“Zheng Xin, what scripture did you cultivate? What martial skill did you create?” Zhao Hongsheng smiled slightly. After all, it was his son.

“Called the Willow Wind Immortal Scroll! It's probably a movement martial skill!” Zheng Xin scratched his head, showing a hint of shame.

“What do you mean 'probably'? What did you see inside?” Zhao Hongsheng's face turned serious, asking.

Hearing Zhao Hongsheng’s question, people also shifted their attention to Zheng Xin, eager to know what martial skill had created an eight thousand zhang tablet.

“I really don't know. I saw a group of very powerful people wanting to kill me, then I ran. I definitely couldn't fight them, so I kept running. They kept chasing me, and then I came out! Dad, I tell you, those people were really strong. They were definitely as strong as you…”

“Shut up!” Zhao Hongsheng showed a helpless expression. He knew his son's nature and cut him off.

Others hearing Zheng Xin’s explanation also had twitching mouths, inwardly sighing at the injustice. They'd struggled with all their might to create a tablet of just a thousand zhang, but this person had created an eight thousand zhang one by running. People were furious.

“Qiuchan, what did you cultivate?” Leng Hongcai smiled and asked Leng Qiuchan.

Hearing his father's question, the corner of Leng Qiuchan’s black veil slightly curved into a perfect arc.

“Half of the Greenwood Emperor’s Scripture!”

“The Heaven-Ordained Wood Emperor's Palm. If perfected, it should be around the middle stage of an Earth-level martial skill!” Her voice remained cold as she spoke.

“This is a true genius. He's cultivated and created an Earth-level middle-stage martial skill!” People showed envy, gazing at Leng Qiuchan.

“Chen'er, what did you cultivate?” Duan Chenfeng's face showed pride. He was very satisfied that Duan Xingchen had raised his tablet to eight thousand seven hundred zhang.

But Duan Xingchen's face was grim, gazing at the remaining youth and Luotian. He didn't know what Luotian had cultivated, but this other youth's tablet was still rising slowly without stopping. This made him unable to accept that he, who had always considered himself the top youth of the Northern Region, was being surpassed.

“Star Transformation!”

“The Falling Star Palm!” Duan Xingchen spoke grudgingly, not wanting to explain the special aspects and power of this scripture and martial skill. But people didn't think Duan Xingchen's cultivation was ordinary. The fact that it had reached eight thousand seven hundred zhang already proved Duan Xingchen's strength.

“Boom…” A deep sound echoed in everyone’s ears, drawing their attention back to the cultivation space.

“The youth's tablet has stopped!” Someone exclaimed.

Chapter 360: The Heaven-Devouring Scripture()

Chapter 360: The Heaven-Devouring Scripture

Under everyone's gaze, the youth’s tablet finally stabilized. His body was robust, and he suddenly opened his eyes. A sense of supreme authority spread throughout the cultivation space from this robust youth.

“Nine thousand one hundred zhang—The height of Yuling Sect’s ancient ancestor!”

“Who is this person? He was previously unknown, yet he has surpassed even Leng Qiuchan and Duan Xingchen!” People's eyes were burning with curiosity, guessing who this robust youth was.

“This boy should enter my Wind-Seeking Valley! Both of you, please grant me a small favor!” Zhao Hongsheng's eyes sparkled.

“Look, the Wind-Seeking Valley’s master has already started to compete. I wonder if the other two sects' masters will join!” The crowd suddenly became chaotic.

“This boy, if cultivated properly in the future, would definitely become a pillar of strength within his sect!” An old man spoke, accompanied by two young people.

If Luotian saw these three, he would definitely recognize them. This old man was none other than Shangguan Fei from the Yumen Sect, who had taken Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei away. The two young people behind him were Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei.

Hearing Shangguan Fei's words, Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei said nothing. However, their gazes carried a hint of seriousness. This youth was truly terrifying; his insight was rare across the Tianyuan Continent.

“Qianxue, Lei'er, you should get closer to such people in the future!” Shangguan Fei spoke to Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei.

“We get close to whom? It's not your place to command us!” Gu Qianxue coldly replied, clearly unafraid of Shangguan Fei, an elder at the Nascent Soul stage.

“You!” Shangguan Fei's face turned grim, looking at Gu Qianxue. Though he had been rebuked by her on the journey, it had become habitual for him. However, as a senior, he had been rebuked by a junior repeatedly, and his patience was at its limit.

Shangguan Fei turned around, his aura surged outward with a cold expression: “You didn’t complete your mission. Prepare to accept punishment!”

“Buzz…” A powerful spiritual energy fluctuation surged from Gu Qianxue.

A cold, bone-piercing sword qi emerged under Shangguan Fei's pressure within Gu Qianxue’s body, circling around her before landing on her hands.

At the moment this sword qi appeared, an icy atmosphere filled the entire Wind-Storm Platform and its surroundings. Even the masters on the high platform instinctively shivered.

“Who…” Some cultivators at the Body-Transcending stage trembled, their faces showing fear as they gazed toward the sword qi.

The masters of the Three Major Sects also cautiously looked at Gu Qianxue and her group, sensing an oppressive pressure from this icy qi.

“Don’t use your seniority to command me. I’ve told you before, you’re not qualified. You have no right to order me to do anything. If I’m pushed, I’ll still cut you down!” Gu Qianxue coldly spoke, her eyes glowing with an icy light.

Gu Lei stood by, arms crossed, a playful smile on his face as he looked at Shangguan Fei. He had long found Shangguan Fei annoying. If it weren’t for the trouble, he would have already used the three sword qi given by that white-cloaked woman to cut Shangguan Fei down.

Seeing Gu Qianxue release the sword qi outside her body, Shangguan Fei’s cold sweat flowed down. He cursed inwardly while forcing a smile: “Qianxue, don’t get angry. There’s something to discuss!”

“Master Shangguan, what's going on?” Duan Chenfeng on the high platform looked puzzled.

This Shangguan Fei was invited by the Sky-Sword Sect. He hadn’t expected him to bring Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei here to watch the Three Major Sects’ recruitment.

“Hmph…” Gu Qianxue coldly snorted, her gaze threatening Shangguan Fei. She then collected the icy sword qi and returned it to her body.

The world immediately returned to its original temperature. Shangguan Fei wiped his cold sweat, then spoke to Duan Chenfeng on the high platform: “Master Duan, I’m sorry. My junior insisted on coming here to watch the fun! Apologies for disturbing you three, and I’m sorry!”

“Haha, no problem. Please invite Master Shangguan and the two geniuses to join us on the platform!” Duan Chenfeng smiled.

Shangguan Fei nodded, and his green spiritual energy wings slowly spread out. Spiritual energy wrapped around Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei, carrying them onto the high platform.

At this moment, Leng Qiuchan, Zheng Xin, and three others had already stood on the high platform. Dozens of Nascent Soul stage sect masters scrutinized Shangguan Fei.

Shangguan Fei was no doubt an elder of the Yumen Sect in the Southern Region. Facing dozens of Nascent Soul stage masters’ scrutiny, his face showed no fear. After greeting Zhao Hongsheng and Leng Hongcai, he smiled and stood beside Duan Chenfeng.

The young people also looked at each other. When Gu Qianxue met Leng Qiuchan’s gaze, an indescribable emotion formed in their hearts.

Gu Lei looked at Zheng Xin and Duan Xingchen, arms crossed with a carefree expression.

Zheng Xin saw Gu Lei immediately and felt this youth was the third person he found interesting besides Luotian. He smiled broadly and approached Gu Lei.

“Apologies to all the masters, please continue!” Shangguan Fei bowed slightly to the Three Masters.

Hearing Shangguan Fei’s reminder, people turned their attention back to the robust youth who had just emerged.

The Three Masters nodded. Zhao Hongsheng smiled: “What's your name?”

“Bu Yuhan!” The youth remained calm before the Three Masters, stating his name.

“What did you cultivate?” Zhao Hongsheng maintained a smile, looking at Bu Yuhan. He was clearly interested in this youth; previously Duan Chenfeng had taken Jiang Honghui, so he wouldn’t compete with him now.

“Sky-Devouring Scripture!”

“The Heaven-Devouring Finger!” Bu Yuhan remained calm as he spoke.

Hearing Bu Yuhan’s words, people inhaled sharply. Even Zhao Hongsheng and Leng Hongcai showed shock.

“Unexpectedly, Bu Yuhan cultivated the Sky-Devouring Scripture!” Duan Chenfeng sighed inwardly.

The Sky-Devouring Scripture might be unknown to others, but as masters of the Eastern Region's Three Major Sects, they naturally knew it.

“The Sky-Devouring Scripture was created by a soul-transcending immortal ten thousand years ago. I never expected it to be cultivated again today. The Sealing Demon Fist was also created by this soul-transcending immortal, and its power must be formidable!” Someone who had heard of the Sky-Devouring Scripture explained.

“Will you join my Wind-Seeking Valley? Leng Xiong, I won’t compete with you for this boy!” Zhao Hongsheng spoke, his eyes sparkling.

Chapter 361: Ascension()

Chapter 361: Ascension

Hearing Zhao Hongsheng’s words, Leng Hongcai wore a strange smile. He hadn’t wanted to compete with Zhao Hongsheng anyway. Now he could give him a favor, which was good.

“Haha, Master Zhao, rest assured. I won’t compete with you. But I want that child!” Leng Hongcai spoke, pointing to Luotian still seated in the cultivation space.

Hearing Leng Hongcai’s confirmation, Zhao Hongsheng showed great joy. Though he favored Luotian, he didn’t think Luotian could be much stronger than Bu Yuhan. Sometimes longer cultivation time didn’t mean better results.

“Congratulations, Master Zhao!” Duan Chenfeng smiled and bowed to Zhao Hongsheng.

Other sect masters knew they couldn’t compete with Zhao Hongsheng and dared not offend him, so they all bowed to Zhao Hongsheng.

The young people stood together, looking at each other with intense battle spirit. Even Gu Qianxue was caught in the battle spirit.

“Bu Yuhan, dare you fight!” Duan Xingchen showed intense battle spirit, his sword pointing at Bu Yuhan.

Previously in the cultivation space, he had been surpassed by Bu Yuhan. He was unwilling to accept it and wanted to surpass Bu Yuhan in combat strength, reclaiming his honor.

“Sure!” Two simple words. Bu Yuhan stepped forward with battle spirit, but his face remained calm.

“Boom…!” As the two faced off, a thunderous sound echoed from the cultivation space.

People’s faces showed confusion as they gazed at the cultivation space. Due to the four people's brilliance, they had forgotten Luotian.

At this moment, another thunderous sound echoed from the cultivation space. People realized there was still one person in it.

“This Body-Transcending stage youth! Though he's not simple, surpassing these four is difficult. I estimate he can reach seven thousand zhang at most!” People murmured, thinking Luotian could barely surpass the four.

Luotian sat in meditation before his tablet, eyes closed with no sorrow or joy. However, the illusion around him kept changing.

At times, the space returned to lush greenery; at others, it turned deathly silent, as if no life remained. These two contrasting states cycled repeatedly.

Finally, after an unknown time, the space stabilized again, returning to its lush greenery. But Luotian was now surrounded by death energy, as if he had been dead for a long time.

Suddenly, Luotian opened his eyes. His eyes flashed with sharp light. He punched the entire space.

This punch carried all of Luotian's death energy.

“Excess leads to decline. The peak of life is death. This punch, extinction of life!” Luotian murmured.

As his words finished, the area where the punch landed lost all vitality. The entire space returned to deathly silence.

Outside, people gazed at Luotian's tablet in the cultivation space. It suddenly turned green, as if filled with life, and erupted violently upward.

“Starts! I wonder how high he can go!” People gazed at the cultivation space with anticipation.

“We’ll also see what this strange youth has cultivated!” Zhao Hongsheng looked curious, gazing at the cultivation space.

Duan Xingchen sheathed his sword, his gaze carrying a cold edge toward Luotian seated there.

Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan also looked with anticipation toward Luotian.

“Eastern Region's geniuses will surely be trampled under your feet. I believe you’ll become the most radiant one again, just like in the Northern Region!” Gu Qianxue’s lips slightly curved upward as she whispered inwardly.

“Hey, brother, I want to tell you this guy is my brother. I just met him! After he comes out, I’ll introduce him to you. Remember, when I first met Luolei, it was truly fated…!” Zheng Xin’s eyes showed excitement as he looked at Luotian, then continued talking with Gu Lei.

“Brother?” Gu Lei sighed and dropped a green pill into his hand. Before Zheng Xin noticed, he slapped it into Zheng Xin’s mouth.

“Ugh… brother, what did you give me…” Zheng Xin showed a strange expression, looking at Gu Lei. Before he could say “what,” his spiritual energy surged into his throat, and he couldn’t speak. His face showed fear.

“Brother, don’t worry. This pill will self-disperse soon!” Gu Lei patted Zheng Xin’s shoulder and comforted him, then turned his gaze back to the cultivation space.

Thunderous roars. Luotian’s tablet turned emerald green, like a piece of jade, and continuously climbed toward the sky.

“One thousand zhang… two thousand zhang…” People silently counted the height, their faces showing anticipation.

“Five thousand zhang…” The jade tablet suddenly stopped at five thousand zhang.

“Hmph… only five thousand zhang… I thought it was so transcendent!” Someone in the crowd mocked, their faces showing disappointment.

The Three Masters' brows slightly furrowed. They had clearly felt that Luotian's cultivation was unusual, but stopping at five thousand zhang fell short of their expectations.

“Hmph, a failure. He's still a failure. Even if he cultivates to the end, it’s nothing!” Duan Xingchen mocked.

In an instant, four cold auras locked onto Duan Xingchen. Even he couldn’t help but feel a tremor in his heart.

“Failure, this word suits you well!” Leng Qiuchan’s eyes showed a cold glint as she looked at Duan Xingchen.

“Qiuchan, you!” Duan Xingchen’s face turned red upon hearing Leng Qiuchan's bias toward Luotian.

Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei looked at Duan Xingchen with cold gazes, as if they would fight if he continued.

Bu Yuhan wore a puzzled expression. His gaze was deep as he looked at Luotian in the cultivation space. For some reason, he felt a killing intent surrounding him.

While people were murmuring, the tablet in the cultivation space suddenly changed. A death energy spread over it. The jade tablet instantly filled with gray mist, becoming lifeless.

Thunderous roars echoed as people watched. The tablet that had stopped at five thousand zhang suddenly surged upward again, and the text continued...
