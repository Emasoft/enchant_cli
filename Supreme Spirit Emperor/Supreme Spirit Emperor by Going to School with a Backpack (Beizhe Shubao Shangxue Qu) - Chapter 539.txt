Time slowly passed, another hour had gone by, as ghostly energy continuously flowed into the black spiritual sphere, and a series of roaring sounds echoed within Luo Tian's grasp.

“Wum……” At last, a terrifying fluctuation emerged from Luo Tian’s hands, causing his expression to shift abruptly.

Chapter 2064: The Arrival of the True Immortal’s Trial

“Hōng……” A thunderous explosion echoed through the black forest, shattering vast stretches of dark trees and causing the small black hill to tremble violently.

“Can this thing even explode?” Luo Tian’s lips twitched as he gazed at the scattered ghostly energy, his heart pounding.

“Indeed! That’s how it was forged!” Luo Tian’s face bore confusion as he rose to his feet, brushing dust from his attire.

The black figure reversed course, reappearing behind Luo Tian, its dark gaze filled with a hint of bewilderment. This figure was none other than the Ghost King, who had intended to depart.

“Senior Ghost King, why have you returned?” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with embarrassment. He knew the Ghost King had been drawn back by his commotion, fearing something might happen to him. This thought warmed Luo Tian’s heart.

“Nothing….” The Ghost King spoke softly, his eyes revealing a complex emotion before he extended a finger, releasing a droplet of black blood from it.

The moment the blood flew out, the Ghost King’s body flickered faintly—this single drop of dark blood was evidently invaluable to him.

“You need to join this!” The Ghost King spoke, then took flight, leaving Luo Tian momentarily stunned.

The black blood hovered in Luo Tian’s palm, deepening his confusion. Yet soon, realization dawned upon him.

“Life? How could it be created from nothing!” Luo Tian’s eyes widened with understanding. To cultivate spiritual herbs, one needed seeds; to forge ghostly entities without foundation also required them.

This was common knowledge for a Ghost Feeder, yet Luo Tian was merely an amateur, newly initiated into the art. The jade slip from Luo Chen had never mentioned it, so he hadn’t considered it.

“Wum……” As this thought struck him, Luo Tian resumed refining the ghostly energy. The dark spiritual force coalesced into his hands once more, while eight-colored flames began to refine it.

Another hour passed, and a louder explosion echoed through the air, reducing the entire hill to ruins. Luo Tian stood amidst the dust, his face grim with anger.

“Still not right?” Luo Tian seethed, but this time, despite the massive commotion, he had identified a flaw.

“Ghostly energy—my cultivation does include it, but I am not truly a ghost cultivator!” Luo Tian surmised this was tied to his own cultivation.

“It seems I must first endure the trial!” Luo Tian spread his palm, and the black blood hovered in his grasp. Yet compared to when the Ghost King had given it to him, its aura was now weaker.

“To endure the trial and become a True Immortal, absorb this world’s ghostly energy, then transform my cultivation entirely into it!”

“Though this might make me an oddity in the Immortal realm, I must first return to it!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, then tossed a medicinal pill into his mouth to heal his wounds.

As Luo Tian recovered, a figure cloaked in black mist approached him, its face etched with coldness.

“Luo Tian, if you die in the Burial Palace, it would be best. If not, I will spare no effort to find you and have my clan eradicate you!”

“Also, Chen Tiansheng—what a bastard! You deliberately led Luo Tian toward me. This isn’t over!” Zhang Menlie’s eyes burned with fury.

After the underground palace explosion, Zhang Menlie had fallen into a mountainous region, barely escaping death. Within the underground palace, he had expended immense energy, nearly perishing at Luo Tian’s hands. He had landed far from his clan, and after recovering, he sought to return home.

His hatred for Luo Tian had never wavered; three times, Luo Tian had nearly taken his life.

“Someone?” As he flew, Zhang Menlie felt a sudden urgency, spotting the gathering clouds above.

“Someone is enduring a trial? The True Immortal’s Trial!” Zhang Menlie instantly recognized the figure seated cross-legged on the ground—Luo Chen’s transformed form.

“He was injured, surely in the underground palace!” Zhang Menlie’s eyes gleamed with a spark of insight.

“Within the underground palace, I expended much energy. Now my pockets are bare. Why not seize this opportunity to threaten him!” Thinking this, Zhang Menlie unleashed his early True Immortal cultivation, charging toward Luo Tian.

Hellish ghost cultivators were ruthless, often committing murder and robbery. Zhang Menlie instantly stood before Luo Tian, a hundred feet away.

“Sense your worth—hand over your treasures!” Zhang Menlie’s voice was cold, laced with authority as he waved his sleeve, sending a gust of malevolence toward Luo Tian.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian opened his eyes, having sensed someone passing by earlier but dismissing it as a passerby. He had no idea it was an old acquaintance.

“Truly…” Luo Tian gazed at Zhang Menlie, speechless, then exhaled sharply.

Two gusts of wind clashed, kicking up a storm of dust, earning Zhang Menlie’s surprise.

Yet as Zhang Menlie was surprised, Luo Tian moved—his body left a lingering shadow on the ground before charging toward Zhang Menlie.

“Die, you unrefined fool! How dare you attack me before enduring the trial!” Zhang Menlie’s face twisted with cruelty, his palm slamming forward.

Zhang Menlie had not recognized Luo Tian; if he had, he would have fled as fast as possible.

One who had escaped Luo Tian three times possessed formidable strength, and even an early True Immortal would tread carefully.

“Wum……” But as Zhang Menlie had just unleashed his strike, he felt an awkwardness in his cultivation.

“Hōng……” Threefold physical strength surged forth, and Luo Tian’s fist collided with the palm.

“Ah……” Zhang Menlie screamed, his body flying backward, and that arm twisted grotesquely.

“How could he be so strong!” Zhang Menlie’s face paled, his legs trembling as pain surged through his arm. Cold sweat poured down his face.

“Kill…” Luo Tian leapt into the air, charging toward Zhang Menlie, but as he flew, a tremendous pressure descended from the heavens, halting his movement.

“Haha! The trial has arrived!” Zhang Menlie’s face lit up with intense joy, taking flight to escape. He stood ten thousand feet away from Luo Tian, intending to watch him be wounded by the trial before striking. That would be safer.

“The trial?” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly; his injuries were nearly healed.

“Hōnglóng……” Thunder rumbled, lightning crackling within the clouds before a golden serpent as thick as a water bucket descended upon Luo Tian.

The Dao roared, the world trembled; thunderbolts rained down, carrying destruction, sweeping across ten thousand feet around Luo Tian.

Within that range, everything was transformed into a sea of lightning, and even the trees and grass on the ground were swept up as if partaking in the trial.

“Go…” Luo Tian struck with a fist toward the golden serpent.

“Chaos….” The thunder was shattered by Luo Tian’s punch, scattering outward.

“How is his fist made!” Zhang Menlie’s lips twitched as he watched Luo Tian shatter the lightning he had feared, his mind in awe.

Zhang Menlie was an early True Immortal who had endured the trial himself; he knew its terror. He had nearly died during his own trial.

“The first lightning is as thick as a water bucket and carries a touch of the Dao’s power. It seems they don’t wish for him to become a True Immortal!” Zhang Menlie’s face bore admiration as he watched the serpent descend again.

“Chaos….” The golden lightning resembled a long dragon, and Luo Tian clashed with it in a fistfight.

“You too should stop watching—let’s join!” The thunder roared, and Luo Tian took flight toward Zhang Menlie, his head crowned with ten thousand lightning bolts.

“Damn!” Zhang Menlie shouted, his face changing instantly as he retreated.

Yet Zhang Menlie’s speed was no match for Luo Tian’s; before he could react, a lightning bolt struck him.

“This scene feels familiar…” As Zhang Menlie was electrocuted wildly, Luo Tian sighed inwardly.

“Why is this happening? Tell me your name!” Zhang Menlie howled, his back wracked by lightning’s annihilating force.

“Luo Chen!” Luo Tian spoke solemnly. As Zhang Menlie entered the range, the lightning grew more terrifying.

“Luo’s family—what did I do to you? I yield! I yield! Don’t chase me anymore!” Zhang Menlie roared, his voice hoarse. After flying with Luo Tian for a while, he could no longer endure it.

“Kill…” But Luo Tian showed no hesitation, relentlessly pursuing Zhang Menlie.

The thunder never ceased; at this moment, Luo Tian was the sovereign—none dared provoke him. Even an Immortal King would bow before him, let alone a minor Zhang Menlie.

“Ancestors, I was wrong! Please grant me a path to survival!” Zhang Menlie wept, his body in shambles. He looked like a stray dog, scorched and unrecognizable.

“His body—what is it made of!” Zhang Menlie gazed at the equally battered but still sky-piercing Luo Tian, his mind in awe.

Yet Zhang Menlie did not connect the figure to Luo Tian; after all, this was near Hell.

And Hell had many prodigies—Zhang Menlie himself could not recognize them all. He now regretted his decision deeply; he had only intended to rob, not kill this person.

Chapter 2065: March Into Black Cloud City

“Shrieks…” The cries never ceased. The trial was particularly harsh on ghost cultivators; Zhang Menlie’s body constantly emitted black smoke, and a charred scent filled the air as he flew desperately through Hell’s land.

“Senior, don’t chase me! I know I was wrong! Why am I so unlucky!” Zhang Menlie kept shouting at Luo Tian, his heart seething with fury.

Within the ten thousand feet of lightning sea, Luo Tian continuously fought against the thunderbolts while chasing Zhang Menlie.

The howls never ceased; Zhang Menlie ran frantically, his body constantly struck by thick lightning bolts from the surrounding sea. He had no choice but to flee with all his might.

“If I’m not mistaken, the front should be a clan! Chen Tiansheng’s branch!” Zhang Menlie, though battered and his power waning, had just recovered.

“Damn it! Chen Tiansheng led Luo Tian to chase me relentlessly back then. Today, I’ll bring this demon to your clan and reclaim my losses!” Zhang Menlie made his decision, transforming into a black streak toward Chen Tiansheng’s branch.

“Lightning sea—moving lightning sea! My god!” Zhang Menlie, with Luo Tian flying alongside him, naturally drew the attention of Hell’s ghost cultivators, who gasped in astonishment.

“Who is that person? How can they command a lightning sea!” Soon, people saw Zhang Menlie’s figure.

Since the central area was distorted by the lightning sea, they couldn’t see Luo Tian’s presence. They only saw Zhang Menlie with a lightning sea trailing behind him, and they regarded him as a prodigy.

“Too fierce! Who is that? He must be a prodigy, perhaps even the son of an Immortal King!” Upon seeing the lightning sea, people immediately retreated far away, watching Zhang Menlie and his lightning sea streak past.

Wherever he went, no grass grew. Zhang Menlie heard the people’s murmurs and felt bitter; he could imagine this event would spread throughout the Beast Ghost King’s forces. Though they didn’t know who he was, someone surely would recognize his name—Zhang Menlie.

If it were any other time, Zhang Menlie would have been delighted at his growing fame; in Hell, strength equated to resources. His name’s popularity would surely draw the elders’ attention and earn him rewards.

But now, Zhang Menlie only wished to escape this demon and return home for healing. After so long, he was already exhausted.

The black city appeared in Zhang Menlie’s view, his eyes glowing with intense joy.

This city was one of Chen Tiansheng’s family territories. The Chen Family was a major clan under the Beast Ghost King, alongside the Luo and Yan families. Each had Immortal Kings stationed within.

Zhang Menlie’s family, though powerful, was still far behind the Chen Family.

But this was merely a small branch of the Chen Family; even if Zhang Menlie perished, the Chen Family would not care. In Hell, it was common for a small city to be destroyed.

This city was named Black Cloud City; its governor, Liu Cheng, possessed early to middle True Immortal cultivation. Though he was a mid-level True Immortal, he was a spirit-feeding ghost, hence Zhang Menlie looked down on him.

Due to being a ghostly entity, Liu Cheng could only serve as the governor of this small city. Otherwise, a mid-level True Immortal would not be confined to such a minor post in the Chen Family.

This was Hell’s contradiction—between ghosts and ghost cultivators.

“What is that thing!” Zhang Menlie hadn’t even reached the city when the black clouds arrived first, plunging the entire city into darkness. The ghost cultivators within were bewildered.

“What’s happening?” Chen Tiansheng sat in the city, his face surprised. He had not died in the underground palace but had fallen into this city instead, staying here to recover.

Chen Tiansheng was one of the two prodigies in the Chen Family. If he hadn’t fallen into this small city, he would never have come here.

Chen Tiansheng’s arrival naturally drew Liu Cheng’s utmost attention; he saw this as an opportunity to ascend.

Knowing Chen Tiansheng was lustful, Liu Cheng had sent many female cultivators to him. He even arranged for his daughter to interact with Chen Tiansheng, pleasing him. Chen Tiansheng took her as a concubine, instantly elevating Liu Cheng’s status.

“Master, a black cloud has drifted in from outside; it seems someone is approaching!” Liu Cheng, though now Chen Tiansheng’s father-in-law, still knew his place and spoke humbly.

“A black cloud? Who dares to cause trouble in my Chen Family? Eliminate them! In a few days, you’ll accompany me back to the Chen Family. After all, you are my father-in-law; this small Black Cloud City is beneath your dignity!” Chen Tiansheng waved dismissively, uninterested. He was surrounded by women, his hands wandering over their bodies.

“This Liu Cheng is a ghostly entity, but his daughter is quite good!” Chen Tiansheng mused inwardly. These days in Black Cloud City, he had been quite happy and decided to keep Liu Cheng by his side.

“Yes!” Liu Cheng quickly replied, his face glowing with joy as he flew out of the hall and exited Black Cloud City. He secretly resolved to destroy this challenger and do it spectacularly, showcasing his strength before Chen Tiansheng.

“Hōnglóng……” Thunder rolled; as Liu Cheng emerged outside the city, he saw the dark clouds above. The annihilating aura made him tremble.

But upon recalling Chen Tiansheng was within Black Cloud City, Liu Cheng felt a surge of confidence. He stood tall, his mid-level True Immortal aura radiating.

“Who dares to play tricks here? I am Liu Cheng, the governor of Black Cloud City. Come forth and die!” Liu Cheng shouted, his voice echoing across the heavens, reverberating within Black Cloud City.

“Governor Liu! The city’s people cheered, their eyes filled with respect as Liu Cheng ascended into the sky.

Liu Cheng heard the people’s praises, a fleeting look of pride in his eyes. He imagined this scene would be seen by Chen Tiansheng, and his image of being formidable would surely elevate his status in Chen Tiansheng’s eyes.

He thought about accompanying Chen Tiansheng back to the Chen Family, where he would play the humble servant but command respect outside. The thought made him slightly excited, so he exerted himself further, making his presence appear even more imposing.

“Mid-level True Immortal!” Zhang Menlie, now just tens of thousands of feet away from Black Cloud City, heard Liu Cheng’s voice and realized he was a mid-level True Immortal. Zhang Menlie’s eyes flickered with light.

“I am from the Ghost Feeder Clan, Zhang Menlie!” As he shouted, Zhang Menlie had already arrived at Black Cloud City’s gates, accompanied by the ten thousand feet of lightning sea.

“You…” Liu Cheng heard Zhang Menlie’s voice and was momentarily stunned. Ghost Feeders held a special status in Hell, and as a ghostly entity himself, Liu Cheng felt some reverence. He was about to respond when a golden lightning bolt struck him.

“Ah…” Black smoke rose from Liu Cheng’s body, his face contorted in agony. His dense black aura seemed purified, and the excruciating pain made him howl.

Lightning had a strong suppression over ghost cultivators; for ghosts, it was nearly annihilating. This lightning would have only wounded a mid-level True Immortal, but for Liu Cheng, it instantly injured him, even shaking his mid-level True Immortal cultivation.

“Master! Save me!” Liu Cheng immediately lost his former authority, turning and fleeing into Black Cloud City.

“Run!” The entire city erupted in chaos; the lightning sea was too terrifying. If it entered Black Cloud City, the entire city would suffer heavy losses.

A wave of figures immediately rushed out of Black Cloud City, and in an instant, the city was empty.

Chen Tiansheng suddenly stood up, flying out of the hall and ascending into the sky above Black Cloud City.

“Master!” Liu Cheng flew to Chen Tiansheng’s side, his eyes filled with fear as he gazed at Zhang Menlie below the city.

“Hōnglóng……” Thunder roared, and a series of lightning bolts surged against Black Cloud City’s gates, instantly turning them into ruins.

“Zhang Menlie!”

“Chen Tiansheng!” At the same time, Zhang Menlie and Chen Tiansheng saw each other, both slightly stunned.

“Zhang Menlie, you dare to seek death!” Chen Tiansheng shouted but trembled as he faced Zhang Menlie’s terrifying lightning sea. Especially seeing Zhang Menlie’s pitiful state, Chen Tiansheng didn’t hesitate and immediately fled.

Liu Cheng also took flight, grabbing his daughter and fleeing.

“Done…” Zhang Menlie’s face darkened upon seeing Chen Tiansheng; he hadn’t expected him to be in Black Cloud City.

“Tiansheng Senior, this is a misunderstanding!” Zhang Menlie shouted, chasing after Chen Tiansheng.

“Zhang Menlie, get away from me!” Chen Tiansheng roared, his heart trembling instantly.

Thunder never ceased; the lightning sea occupied half of Black Cloud City, and the heavens trembled. Half of Black Cloud City was instantly turned to dust.

“Still old acquaintances!” Luo Tian stood within the lightning sea, a faint smile on his face. He didn’t chase Zhang Menlie and Chen Tiansheng, as he now felt a powerful pressure.

Chapter 2066: Oath of Submission

Black Cloud City was half-destroyed by the terrifying lightning, and Luo Tian’s immortal energy continuously surged to repel the thunderbolts that could severely wound an early True Immortal.

Zhang Menlie, Chen Tiansheng, and Liu Cheng stood there, their faces filled with fear, secretly relieved that the lightning had stopped.

“My Black Cloud City!” Liu Cheng trembled emotionally, gazing at his city destroyed by the terrifying lightning. It was his life’s work, now half-ruined.

“Why did I offend anyone?” Liu Cheng felt immense frustration but dared not step beyond the lightning’s reach.

“Zhang Menlie, you must give me an explanation!” Chen Tiansheng’s face darkened as he glared at Zhang Menlie with a sinister gaze.

“Senior Chen, I was unintentional. I was being chased by that man and sought help from the Black Cloud City Governor, but it turned out like this. Senior Chen, I will definitely compensate for all the losses in Black Cloud City!” Zhang Menlie spoke loudly.

At this moment, Zhang Menlie was pitifully battered; his resources had been exhausted from consecutive battles. His cultivation had dropped to a half-step True Immortal, and he could only recover through his techniques.

But Chen Tiansheng’s anger needed to be pacified, for their statuses were unequal. If he couldn’t calm Chen Tiansheng’s anger and it escalated to the family, Zhang Menlie would be in trouble.

“A city? That’s all you offer me? Am I so worthless to you, Chen Tiansheng?” Chen Tiansheng coldly watched Zhang Menlie, his gaze dangerous.

“Senior Chen…” Zhang Menlie looked at Chen Tiansheng and immediately understood—Chen Tiansheng was threatening him, demanding a ransom.

Indeed, Chen Tiansheng had suffered greatly in the Burial Palace and sought to extort Zhang Menlie.

Zhang Menlie felt bitter, recalling that if it weren’t for Chen Tiansheng leading Luo Tian to him, he wouldn’t be in this pitiful state. Perhaps with his resources, he could have eliminated the one enduring the trial.

“Do you resent it?” Chen Tiansheng instantly noticed Zhang Menlie’s resentment, his face showing contempt.

“A top-grade ghost artifact, five mid-grade ghost artifacts, and a hundred sixth-grade elixirs. This settles it. Oh, right, your family is also a Ghost Feeder clan—add fifty half-step True Immortals’ ghostly entities!” Chen Tiansheng spoke softly but with an imperious tone.

Upon hearing Chen Tiansheng’s words, Zhang Menlie’s face turned pale; he couldn’t afford what Chen Tiansheng demanded.

“Chen Tiansheng, don’t push too far! My Zhang Family isn’t easy to bully. I am a prodigy of the Zhang Family!”

“Previously, in the Burial Palace, you led Luo Tian that bastard to chase me, leaving my treasures exhausted!”

“Now I’ve only destroyed half your city. You’re already demanding compensation!” Zhang Menlie’s eyes burned red, his gaze furious at Chen Tiansheng. Under such pressure, he finally erupted.

“Zhang Menlie! How dare you speak to me like that!” Chen Tiansheng roared, his gaze icy toward Zhang Menlie.

“The Zhang Family isn’t anything! If you say the Zhang Family is no good, then I’ll show you. From now on, I’ll make you live like a dog, homeless!” Chen Tiansheng sneered, surprised by Zhang Menlie’s defiance.

After speaking, Chen Tiansheng extended his hand, and a token appeared in it—this was the token symbolizing Chen Tiansheng’s identity.

Without hesitation, he pointed his finger, and a mark flew from his hand into the token.

“You…” Zhang Menlie panted heavily; upon seeing the mark land on the token, he felt some regret. But thinking of his family, he gritted his teeth and stood there.

“Ghost Feeder Clan, Zhang Family’s heir Zhang Menlie has defected. Today, he is expelled from the Zhang Clan. From now on, any member of the Zhang Clan who encounters Zhang Menlie must kill him without mercy!” A cold voice echoed in Zhang Menlie’s ears.

Zhang Menlie’s token glowed intensely, and as the voice faded, his face turned even paler, devoid of color. He collapsed to the ground.

Expulsion from the clan! Expelled from the Zhang Family!

These words deeply etched into Zhang Menlie’s mind, like a thunderclap. His eyes showed disbelief.

“I only offended Chen Tiansheng, and now I’m expelled from the clan!”

“And it’s defection! They’ll kill me without mercy!” Zhang Menlie’s eyes showed intense resentment, his fists clenched tightly as he roared.

“Zhang Menlie, this is the fate of opposing me!” Chen Tiansheng stood high above, looking down at Zhang Menlie with a triumphant gaze.

Liu Cheng’s face also slightly changed; he knew the Zhang Family’s strength. He hadn’t expected that just one sentence from Chen Tiansheng would expel Zhang Menlie.

“This is the fate of opposing me!”

“Despair? This isn’t over; I’ll take your life too!” Chen Tiansheng sneered, then took flight like a black eagle toward Zhang Menlie.

“I won’t submit!” Zhang Menlie roared, his body radiating a wild aura.

“Peng…” The two palms collided; the thunderous sound sent Zhang Menlie flying backward, his body collapsing onto the ground.

If Zhang Menlie were at full strength, he might have fought Chen Tiansheng, but after being chased by Luo Tian, his state was pitiful. His cultivation had dropped to a half-step True Immortal and was no match for Chen Tiansheng at his peak.

Zhang Menlie lay on the ground, his eyes filled with fierce defiance as he gazed at Chen Tiansheng above.

“Defiance is useless; this is the gap—between strength and status, you are no match for me. With one word, you are like this!” Chen Tiansheng descended from the sky, his foot stomping down toward Zhang Menlie.

“My only chance is that trial demon!” Seeing Chen Tiansheng’s descending foot, he thought desperately of his path to survival.

“Master, I wish to follow you! Please save my life!” Zhang Menlie roared, flipping his body to dodge Chen Tiansheng’s foot.

“Peng…” Shattered stones flew, and Chen Tiansheng landed where Zhang Menlie had just lain.

“Haha! Do you think he can save you? This True Immortal trial is extremely powerful. Even I would perish! Do you think he can withstand it? Even if he does, he’ll be severely wounded. Then I won’t let him live either!” Chen Tiansheng laughed, his voice laced with contempt.

Chen Tiansheng roared and took flight again, charging toward Zhang Menlie with a long sword in hand.

“Is it really no use?” As Chen Tiansheng’s words just finished, a solemn voice echoed within the lightning sea.

“Hōnglóng……”

Thunder roared, winds twisted, and a powerful pressure swept over Chen Tiansheng, making his face grim.

“Why is my cultivation so sluggish!” Chen Tiansheng’s face changed, halting his movement as he watched the lightning sea gradually subside.

The sky slowly returned to darkness, and the lightning sea dispersed, revealing a black vortex above Black Cloud City. A figure in white robes stood there, but his body exuded faint ghostly energy.

The ghostly energy gradually thickened, obscuring the white robe and eventually turning it black, making the figure appear sinister.

“Who is he?” Chen Tiansheng’s eyes narrowed, gazing at the seated Luo Tian.

Due to Luo Chen being a bastard son, Chen Tiansheng only knew Luo Bai of the Luo Family. He had heard of Luo Chen but never seen him, and even if he did, he would have dismissed him.

The vortex faded, and Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, a hint of joy in them. His dan tian’s small figure had fully turned black—meaning, from today, Luo Tian was a ghost cultivator!

“Wum……” A flash of light, and Luo Tian took flight toward Chen Tiansheng.

“Hōu……” A black dragon coiled around Luo Tian’s arm, striking toward Chen Tiansheng with a fist.

“Get out of my way!” Chen Tiansheng roared, feeling as if a primordial beast was charging toward him. His heart trembled with fear but he still swung his sword at Luo Tian.

A fist struck, and the black sword was shattered from Chen Tiansheng’s hand. The fist, enhanced by the Dragon-Subduing Form and Soul-Nourishing Art, struck Chen Tiansheng’s chest.

A crackling sound rose from Chen Tiansheng’s chest, and his entire torso caved inward. He was sent flying backward, collapsing onto the ground.

Zhang Menlie’s eyes gleamed with light as he gazed at Luo Tian, who seemed like a deity. Though he had expected it, he was still awestruck by Luo Tian’s power.

“Is he truly an early True Immortal?” Liu Cheng trembled, feeling that even a mid-level True Immortal like himself couldn’t withstand Luo Tian’s fist.

Luo Tian stepped onto the ground, his foot crushing Chen Tiansheng as he finally gazed at Zhang Menlie.

“You wish to submit to me?” Luo Tian’s face bore amusement as he addressed Zhang Menlie.

“Yes!” Zhang Menlie’s eyes flickered, then he gritted his teeth; at this moment, the unknown young man before him was truly his last hope.

“Liu Cheng, kill this kid! I’ll reward you greatly!” Chen Tiansheng roared, feeling as if a mountain had been placed on his back, preventing him from moving.

Chen Tiansheng was now extremely frustrated; he had intended to subdue Luo Tian but instead found himself defeated in one move.

“I need an oath of submission!” Luo Tian gazed deeply at Zhang Menlie, speaking softly.

Chapter 2067: Submission

“Oath of submission!” Zhang Menlie’s face turned solemn as he gazed at Chen Tiansheng beneath Luo Tian’s feet, then gritted his teeth and stepped toward him.

“What are you doing, Zhang Menlie!” Chen Tiansheng saw the madness in Zhang Menlie’s eyes and instantly understood his intention. He felt regret, realizing he had given no path for Zhang Menlie to escape, even pushing him into a dead end.

“You gave me no path to live; so you die first!” Zhang Menlie’s eyes flashed with madness, his hand raising a black sword toward Chen Tiansheng’s chest.

“Don’t harm my young master!” Liu Cheng shouted, his mind racing. He was a mid-level True Immortal; if he saved Chen Tiansheng now, his future in the Chen Family would surely soar.

Though Luo Tian seemed powerful, Liu Cheng had already decided to take the risk. As a ghostly entity, he was often looked down upon; a city governor might be significant, but if a human was a mid-level True Immortal, he would definitely command a major city.

Chen Tiansheng was Liu Cheng’s opportunity—a chance to turn his fortune around!

“Kill…” Thinking this, Liu Cheng even burned his cultivation, his hands moving as a black ghost mark descended from the sky toward Luo Tian.

“Ah! You’re a spirit-feeding ghost!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with amusement, and he extended his finger. A single strike shattered the descending ghost mark.

Luo Tian hadn’t even lifted his foot, but a fist struck out with the Dragon-Subduing Form combined with the Soul-Nourishing Art.

“Hōu……” The black dragon roared, and the black fist shot toward Liu Cheng.

Liu Cheng’s face changed instantly. Though he had resisted the attack, his mid-level True Immortal cultivation was no match for Luo Tian’s fist.

“You have some skill!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed a hint of surprise; his fist had definitely wounded an early True Immortal, yet Liu Cheng had resisted it.

“Don’t underestimate me!” Seeing Luo Tian’s contemptuous gaze, Liu Cheng’s face turned furious. He burned his cultivation and transformed into a streak of light, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Still prideful!” Luo Tian’s face remained calm as he struck again, his fist releasing three afterimages—this was the evolution of the Wild Wind Hammer.

The thunderous sound echoed, and Liu Cheng transformed into a cloud of black mist, instantly forming a divine bell that crushed down.

The collision echoed through the heavens; the black divine bell shattered, dispersing into a swirl of black mist around Luo Tian. It coalesced into Liu Cheng’s form, his face pale and eyes filled with awe.

“Crack…” At the same time, Chen Tiansheng’s chest caved inward, blood spewing from his mouth.

“Wum…” The black sword descended, and Zhang Menlie’s eyes flashed with cruelty, fully committing himself.

“Zhang Menlie, stop! I’ll have your family recall you!” Chen Tiansheng roared, sensing Zhang Menlie’s fierce intent.

“It’s too late! This is what you forced me to do!” Zhang Menlie roared wildly, his heart now fully set on killing.
