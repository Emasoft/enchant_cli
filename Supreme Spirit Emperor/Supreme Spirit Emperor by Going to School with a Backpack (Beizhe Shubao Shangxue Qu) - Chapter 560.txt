“Boom...” The thunderous sound of collision echoed as two fists clashed with a resounding crash, shaking the platform and leaving deep footprints before Luo Tian and Qiu Long.

“His physical strength is formidable!” Both Luo Tian and Qiu Long felt a chill in their hearts. Luo Tian’s gaze turned solemn as he looked at Qiu Long.

“Again!” Qiu Long roared, his body radiating a dark divine law.

“Afraid of you?” Luo Tian smiled, leaping into the air again. The thunderous clashes continued as they fought under the astonished gazes of the crowd.

Boom... Boom...

They clashed like two mountains, each spitting blood with every impact.

“Even Qiu Long couldn’t defeat him!” Mo Tian and Wang Gang were stunned, their eyes locking onto Luo Tian’s pale face.

“Fascinating!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with excitement; this was his first encounter with someone who could match him in physical strength.

“Exhilarating!” Qiu Long roared, his breath heavy as he stared at Luo Tian with a changed gaze.

“Is this truly your strength? If you lose, I won’t take your life!” Qiu Long laughed, his body swelling with power. The crowd felt his physical strength growing at an alarming rate.

“This is the Hua Shan Quan, a must-learn technique of the Mountain King. Every Mountain King masters it. I never expected Qiu Chengtian to teach it so quickly to Qiu Long!” Wang Gang’s expression darkened.

A black aura enveloped Qiu Long, and a shadowy mountain appeared behind him.

“Crush!” Qiu Long bellowed, his foot striking the ground as he charged at Luo Tian.

“This is truly strong—I underestimated you!” Luo Tian sighed, watching the black mountain barreling toward him.

“Manifesting the World!” Luo Tian roared, his body expanding into a colossal figure. The ancient heavy aura of the wilderness filled the air as he became a true giant.

“This technique!” Ye Chen’s eyes narrowed in thought, but his confusion faded quickly.

“Boom...” The collision shattered the air. The black mountain slammed into Luo Tian’s giant form.

“Stop!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, wrapping his arms around the mountain. His body retreated step by step, each movement lowering the platform until it crumbled into dust.

Chapter 2133: Fu Xingxuan Appears

Turbulent winds and swirling dust obscured the battlefield, leaving the outcome of their clash unknown.

“Boom...” As the crowd marveled, another thunderous crash echoed, leaving them awestruck.

“Still fighting!” The crowd gasped, hearing the relentless collision.

“One... two..."

The echoes reverberated like a mountain striking the earth. Within tens of breaths, hundreds of collisions resounded. As the dust settled, a figure stood defiantly, pale and bloodstained.

“I lost!” Qiu Long rose slowly, his gaze filled with respect as he looked at Luo Tian. Though they hadn’t used their cultivation, Qiu Long had relied on his physical strength.

The crowd erupted in shock, staring at Luo Tian, who also panted heavily.

“Defeated by Luo Chen! And in his strongest domain!” The crowd gasped.

“My heavens, my bets!” A chorus of lamentations rose as people recalled their heavy wagers.

Mo Tian and Hong Tao furrowed their brows. Though they had heard Luo Tian’s unmatched physical strength, they hadn’t taken him seriously. But now, they regarded him as their equal.

“Defeating Qiu Long is nothing; just avoid his physical strength!” Mo Tian’s eyes gleamed as he stared at Luo Tian.

“Luo Chen, you were so brave earlier! I’m swooning!” Su Dan winked at Luo Tian.

“You could’ve fought longer; who would win is uncertain!” Luo Tian replied, his gaze on Qiu Long.

“I can afford to lose. My Hua Shan Quan is superior, but it’s evenly matched—perhaps even inferior. This technique allows only three transformations at my current level. Even with two more, I couldn’t defeat you. So surrender now and let you face the next opponent.”

“After all, if I exhaust you, the next challenger would look foolish. It’d be embarrassing for me!” Qiu Long smiled, tossing a storage ring to Luo Tian.

“Thank you,” Luo Tian bowed respectfully; Qiu Long had left a good impression.

“Let me recover! Damn it, let me recover!” A string of curses echoed as people rushed to Zhang Tianhe’s bet-takers, placing more wagers.

“I’ll try!” Amid the crowd’s anxious waiting, a pale figure emerged.

“Son of the Heaven-Devil King, Duan Boyang!” Luo Tian recognized the pale youth and felt a surge of killing intent.

He recalled Duan Peizhen’s vile face and the tormenting Tian Luo Toxin that nearly took his life.

“Sissy, stay away! What’s your business?” As Duan Boyang stepped forward, a streak of light intercepted him.

“Hong Tao!” Duan Boyang’s face darkened, his eyes flashing with malice. He pointed, summoning a black dragon toward the youth who had reached Luo Tian.

“Buzz...” Hong Tao vanished in a blur, appearing behind Luo Tian with a black dagger aimed at his heart.

Luo Tian faced two attacks: the dragon from Duan Boyang and Hong Tao’s dagger.

Luo Tian’s face shifted; he raised a barrier, but the dagger clashed with his red scabbard.

Flames erupted as Hong Tao’s surprise deepened, and the barrier shattered. The black dragon surged toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s breath caught—this was no ordinary beast but a toxic one.

“Indeed, the son of the Heaven-Devil King! A master of poisons!” Luo Tian mused, his roar summoning a black elephant that crushed the dragon.

“Boom...” The dragon was shattered, scattering into waves of toxic mist.

“You two want to fight together? I don’t mind!” Luo Tian’s wind-like aura repelled the poison.

The True Immortal elders’ faces darkened as they channeled divine laws to contain the mist. Yet, many disciples were poisoned, collapsing with white foam.

“Duan Boyang, save them!” The elders cried, but Duan Boyang coldly replied, “Only by draining their cultivation can they survive.”

The elders’ faces paled as they rushed to save the poisoned disciples.

As the chaos unfolded, Hong Tao ceased his attack, observing Duan Boyang. If he hadn’t dodged in time, it would’ve been him.

“You’re too hasty!” Luo Tian said softly, gazing at Hong Tao and Duan Boyang.

Their previous clash had destroyed the platform; their reckless attacks led to this disaster. If the platform remained, hundreds of disciples wouldn’t be lying there.

“Buzz...” As Luo Tian’s words faded, a golden river descended from the sky, condensing into hundreds of raindrops that fell on the poisoned disciples.

The golden droplets entered their bodies, and the disciples screamed in pain as white smoke rose. After tens of breaths, they stood up, eyes alight with joy.

“Yellow Spring Water!” The elders gasped.

“My poison is gone, and my cultivation has improved!” Disciples cheered.

“Only the two Grand Masters or the Holy Maiden can wield Yellow Spring Water!” One disciple murmured.

“Is it the Grand Masters or the Holy Maiden who saved them?” Elders exchanged glances.

“Buzz...” As they pondered, a vortex appeared on the 99th black sky. A figure stepped out.

Purple eyes, long purple hair with a white flower pinned in it—this was the Hell’s Holy Bloom, the彼岸花 (Afterlife Lotus).

A black veil obscured her face; a black robe wrapped her perfect body, radiating like a star.

“Perfection!” The crowd could only describe her with these words, even Su Dan, renowned for beauty, seemed pale in comparison.

“Hail the Holy Maiden!” All elders bowed, reverence in their eyes.

Luo Tian stood motionless, gazing at the woman emerging from the vortex, his eyes moist with longing.

He wanted to call out but stopped himself, lowering his head with a bitter smile.

Her purple eyes met his briefly before she glanced away.

“Why are you doing this?” Fu Xingxuan’s melodious voice echoed, snapping the crowd from their trance.

“Report to the Holy Maiden—we’re holding a duel!” Hong Tao spoke, his eyes full of admiration.

“Xingxuan, you’ve come out!” Su Dan smiled, flying to Fu Xingxuan’s side.

“You’re participating too?” Fu Xingxuan glanced at Su Dan, the only one in the Wheel Turning Sect who could be close to her.

Two peerless beauties stood, one seductive, the other icy—opposite extremes that could bewilder anyone.

“I couldn’t handle Luo Chen’s strength!” Su Dan laughed, glancing at Luo Tian, who stared at Fu Xingxuan.

“Men are all no good! You flirted with me earlier, but when Xingxuan appeared, your eyes nearly fell out!” Su Dan pouted.

“Luo Chen?” Fu Xingxuan’s brow furrowed, her eyes locking with Luo Tian. His gaze had changed—only those close could sense it.

“Do you姓Luo?” Fu Xingxuan asked, her voice tinged with hope.

“My name is Luo Chen.” Luo Tian replied softly. He longed to say he was Luo Tian, but revealing his identity would mean death by the Wheel Turning Sect.

Chapter 2134: Recognized

Fu Xingxuan, the Holy Maiden of the Wheel Turning Sect, was a Late-stage True Immortal. She had only been an Early-stage Immortal when she arrived, but in days, her growth was due to the Reincarnation Pool in the Sect’s final layer.

Zhang Tianhe transmitted a message to Luo Tian, his voice burning with fervor; most male disciples regarded Fu Xingxuan as a goddess.

“I don’t believe it!” Fu Xingxuan’s eyes narrowed, her gaze on Luo Tian. She grabbed his jade pendant, her expression cold.

“Where did you get this?” Her eyes flashed with suspicion as the disciples’ faces turned icy.

“Still popular, I see!” Luo Tian thought, gazing at Fu Xingxuan. “This is my brother’s. I killed him, and it came to me.”

Fu Xingxuan’s eyes darkened. “Thank you for avenging me!”

“Continue,” she said, still doubtful.

“Yes!” They bowed, unsure of her meaning. Five minor kings rushed forward, their auras exploding.

“Luo Chen, I’ll fight you!” Mo Tian roared, leaping beside Luo Tian.

“Wait your turn; I went first!” Duan Boyang smirked, shaking his hair.

“Correct, you’ve no chance!” Hong Tao joined, but Wang Gang and Qiu Long stayed back. The remaining five minor kings stepped forward, ready to kill Luo Tian.

They all wanted to impress Fu Xingxuan, the Holy Maiden who controlled the Reincarnation Pool.

“This is my wife! What are you?” Luo Tian cursed inwardly, but his face showed disdain.

“Fight all five of you!” Luo Tian swung his sword, not wanting to be humiliated in front of Fu Xingxuan.

“However, rebuild the platform first; otherwise, this disaster will repeat!” He shook his head.

“No need—the platform is yours! Fight quickly!” Fu Xingxuan interrupted, her hand waving. A black stone platform emerged from her palm, expanding into ten thousand feet as Luo Tian’s Long Yuan sword trembled.

“Boom...” The platform grew, its pressure making breaths shallow.

“This is the Sect’s top-tier ghost weapon—the Battle Platform!” A True Immortal elder gasped.

“Boom...” The platform landed, its battle spirit rising.

“This is the Sect’s treasure, the Battle Platform? I didn’t expect the Holy Maiden to gain its approval! Does she have the Mirror of Chaos too? If so, even a Late-stage True Immortal would die!” The crowd bowed respectfully.

“This platform is used for the Sect’s battles; fighting here is an honor!” Fu Xingxuan said, her gaze on Luo Tian.

“Haha! Come on, fight all five of us!” Luo Tian laughed, leaping onto the platform.

His sword raised, his aura soared, blending with the platform’s battle spirit to give him a regal presence.

“Ugh! Luo Chen, you’re finally a man!” Su Dan’s words ruined the moment, erasing Luo Tian’s aura.

“Buzz...” Hong Tao vanished, his body like a feather as he leapt onto the platform. Unlike Luo Tian’s aura, Hong Tao was silent and elusive.

“Damn it, speed is no match for this bastard!” The others cursed but didn’t rush.

“Continue!” Hong Tao sneered, sending a streak of light toward Luo Tian. He then leapt forward, his speed surpassing the light.

“Speed—extreme speed!” Luo Tian’s mind sharpened; he hated fast opponents.

“Buzz...” His sword blocked Hong Tao’s light, sparks flying as it returned to the ground.

Meanwhile, Hong Tao appeared behind Luo Tian, his dagger aimed at his back.

“Return!” Luo Tian roared, swinging Long Yuan. He ignored the dagger, spinning to strike Hong Tao.

“Hmm?” Hong Tao’s face shifted; he felt the wind and reacted, twisting his body to escape.

“Truly strong!” The five minor kings watched, their eyes on the battle. Hong Tao’s speed was known to them; they all felt uneasy.

“Good, he knows sacrifice!” Hong Tao’s face showed concern.

If he had attacked, Luo Tian would’ve been injured but not killed; however, Luo Tian’s strike would have wounded him.

“Fools…” Luo Tian sighed inwardly; he relied on instinct, but Hong Tao’s speed was too fast for him to track.

“Buzz...” His vast spiritual awareness spread, covering the platform.

As his awareness expanded, Hong Tao’s second attack began. His body vanished, streaks of light flying from all directions toward Luo Tian.

“Go!” Luo Tian roared, his aura exploding as Long Yuan swung again. A wave of energy enveloped him, clashing with the lights.

“Where is he?” Luo Tian’s face darkened; his spiritual awareness couldn’t find Hong Tao.

“I’m here!” A figure descended, dagger aimed at Luo Tian’s head.

“Buzz...” Without hesitation, Luo Tian activated the King-Enthroning Battle Art and Yin Shadow Ghost Step, vanishing. Hong Tao appeared at Luo Tian’s former spot, his dagger stained with blood.

“Too fast!” The disciples’ faces turned shocked; even the True Immortal elders were stunned.

“Xingxuan, what’s wrong?” Su Dan asked, her eyes filled with confusion. She felt Xingxuan tremble, an unprecedented reaction.

“Nothing,” Xingxuan forced a smile, but her heart trembled. The Yin Shadow Ghost Step and King-Enthroning Battle Art—how could she not recognize them? She had known Luo Tian for millennia.

From the start, Xingxuan had been 60% certain this Luo Chen was Luo Tian. Now she confirmed it: the man on the platform was her husband, Luo Tian.

She suppressed the urge to reveal herself, smiling instead. That smile lit up the sky, making disciples who hadn’t watched the battle gaze at her in awe.

“Su Dan, help me bet; I wager Luo Chen will win!” Xingxuan whispered, handing Su Dan a storage ring.

“Okay,” Su Dan’s eyes widened but took the ring, placing it before the bet recorder.

“Su Dan, Senior Sister!” The recorder’s face turned red, avoiding Su Dan’s gaze.

“This is my bet—Luo Chen wins. Take it!” Su Dan patted the disciple’s head, laughing as she returned to Xingxuan.

“Smells good!” The disciples greedily inhaled the fragrance, eyes burning with desire for Su Dan.

“Wait—Su Dan, you bet on Luo Chen?” The crowd awoke, stunned.

“My heavens…” The recorder opened the ring, gasping as it nearly dropped.

“What’s wrong?” Zhang Tianhe and Ye Chen approached, their faces puzzled.

“This…” The disciple handed the ring to Zhang Tianhe, trembling.

“Damn it!” Their faces changed as they saw its contents: a hundred white flowers, identical to Xingxuan’s.

“Done…” Zhang Tianhe paled; these flowers were priceless.

Luo Tian had planned to let disciples and the five minor kings bet heavily, then win the match to take all. He set high odds, assuming no one would bet on him. But now, how could they repay a hundred of these flowers?

Chapter 2135: The Young Assassin

On the battle platform, Luo Tian stood with a blood hole on his shoulder. Hundred feet away, Hong Tao smiled, dagger stained with blood.

“Fast, but useless! You can’t match my speed!” Hong Tao said, vanishing again. He appeared at another direction, a black dagger forming into a dragon toward Luo Tian.

Blurred images—sixteen Hong Tao figures surrounded Luo Tian, each a solid form.

“Those are all real bodies; it’s just his speed!” The True Immortal elders marveled.

“He’s improved—earlier he could only create ten,” Wang Gang sighed.

“Big brother, fight hard! If you lose, I’ll be the only one to fail!” Qiu Long’s face held hope.

“Buzz...” Luo Tian swung Long Yuan, divine light bursting into a sword beam that blocked the sixteen daggers.

“Where is he?” Luo Tian closed his eyes, sensing the disturbances.

The world fell silent; only the sound of wind remained.

“Back!” The buzz echoed as Luo Tian felt coldness on his back. He spun, dissolving into the sword’s aura.

The sword slashed downward, and Hong Tao appeared at Luo Tian’s former spot.

“Boom...” The black sword struck the platform, shaking it but leaving no mark. Hong Tao’s sweat dripped as he realized Luo Tian had nearly hit him.

“How?” The crowd gasped, staring at Luo Tian.

“How did you know?” Hong Tao asked, stunned. He was certain Luo Tian couldn’t sense his movements.

“Instinct!” Luo Tian’s form separated from Long Yuan, gazing at Hong Tao.

“Again!” Hong Tao’s eyes burned with defiance, leaping again. Sixteen daggers flew toward Luo Tian.

“Stop!” This time, Luo Tian didn’t use Long Yuan but extended his hand. An invisible wave radiated from him, halting the daggers mid-air.

“Limitless!” Luo Tian slammed his hand to the ground, his spiritual awareness engulfing the platform. His soul force was terrifying, turning into gray mist that shrouded everything.

“Strong spiritual awareness!” The crowd gasped, staring at Luo Tian in the mist.

Hong Tao’s face was grim; he hadn’t expected Luo Tian’s spiritual power to be this formidable. He felt pressure, as if trapped in a swamp.

“Here you are!” Luo Tian smiled, pointing his finger. The Eight Directions Treasure Technique targeted the sixteen daggers.

“Buzz...” The daggers flew toward Hong Tao, who shifted his body but found Luo Tian blocking his path.

“Cunning! This is the platform!” Luo Tian smiled, Long Yuan slicing downward. The sword’s aura cut through the mist, striking Hong Tao.

“Crack...” The black dagger blocked the sword but was pushed back, leaving smoke as Hong Tao retreated.

Meanwhile, the sixteen daggers attacked. Hong Tao blocked Luo Tian’s sword but felt a gust of wind beneath his feet, his body flashing with residual images. He leaped over the daggers, escaping the platform.

“Return!” Hong Tao roared, summoning his daggers back to him, including those Luo Tian had previously knocked down.

“I lost!” Hong Tao said softly, tossing a storage ring to Luo Tian.

“You didn’t fight your best!” Qiu Long smiled, approaching Hong Tao.

“Bullshit! You didn’t either!” Hong Tao sneered, blood trickling from his lips. They exchanged a awkward smile—both were heirs to the kings, with special means but at great cost. They preferred to lose rather than waste their life-saving techniques.

“Useless!” Duan Boyang sneered, vanishing into smoke toward the platform.

But as he leaped, another streak of light appeared—a black sword materialized on the platform. A figure arrived before Duan Boyang, standing on the platform.

Black attire, flowing black hair, a pale face—his presence was regal, his sword raised. His aura radiated strength, and he looked like a jade figure.

“Wang Heng?” The crowd gasped, staring at the newcomer. Female disciples blushed.

Wang Heng was the son of the Yuan Ghost King, renowned for his beauty and popularity among female disciples. He was kind but despised by male disciples for his hypocrisy.

“Ugly!” Duan Boyang sneered, watching Wang Heng on the platform without competing.

“Luo Chen, fight harder and knock this bastard off!” The other minor kings urged Luo Tian.

They knew Wang Heng’s true nature: a deceitful man who had ruined many female disciples, even impregnating them before secretly aborting the pregnancies. He never married, maintaining his “good image.”

“Wang Heng Senior, fight this newcomer!” Female disciples screamed.

“Luo Brother, I also use a sword; let’s duel!” Wang Heng waved his black sword, causing more screams.

But Luo Tian stood motionless, stunned by Zhang Tianhe’s revelation about Fu Xingxuan’s bet.

“This girl…” Luo Tian’s lips twitched, gazing at Fu Xingxuan. She returned his gaze with a playful look.

Luo Tian knew she had recognized him; her awareness of the Yin Shadow Ghost Step and King-Enthroning Battle Art made it impossible to hide.

“A hundred Afterlife Lotus flowers—this girl has done well in the Sect!”

“But her personality is still the same,” Luo Tian sighed, sending a mental message to Zhang Tianhe. After confirming everything was fine, he smiled at Wang Heng.

“Truly handsome!” Luo Tian marveled at Wang Heng’s first sight. But when he heard the crowd’s screams, his brow furrowed.

“Get down and kneel to Wang Heng Senior! Let him kill you!”
“Wang Heng Senior’s strength is unmatched! This Luo Chen is terrified!” The crowd’s voices grated on his nerves.

“Idiots!” Luo Tian thought, instantly disliking Wang Heng.

Wang Heng’s face darkened; he felt humiliated when Luo Tian ignored him.

“What did you say?” Luo Tian smiled, knowing only that Wang Heng was the son of Yuan Ghost King Wang Wen. He knew nothing else about him.

“Draw your sword!” Wang Heng roared, his black sword glowing with power. His body merged with the blade as he attacked Luo Tian.

“Hmph, merging with your sword!” Luo Tian smiled, swinging Long Yuan to clash with the black blade.

“Crack...” The collision sent Luo Tian back two steps, while Wang Heng emerged from the blade.

“I heard you have a sword technique that killed a Late-stage True Immortal elder in the Sect. I’d like to see it!” Wang Heng smiled, his eyes lingering on Long Yuan with greed.
