"Great opportunity! Perhaps within this Star River Mansion, I could attain the realm of Heavenly Dao!" Luo Tian murmured to himself, sensing the immense energy within his two horns. He then sat in meditation, beginning to refine the immortal essence contained within them. Naturally, his Splitting Heaven Spear was also involved in this process.

One man and one spear began refining the immortal essence within the four horns. This time, it took half a month.

"Boom...!" After absorbing the immortal essence from two of the horns, Luo Tian's dantian underwent a complete transformation. Within his golden cycle of reincarnation, a thick stream of energy hovered there. Though it seemed modest, the sensation it gave Luo Tian was that of boundless power, as if even his reincarnation bridge appeared inferior in comparison.

"This immortal essence, when activated, could annihilate a near-king!" A smile spread across Luo Tian's face.

Chapter 1706: Thank You ()

"If my reincarnation bridge within the dantian were forged entirely from immortal essence, and every technique I wielded carried this energy, would that make me an immortal?" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with anticipation. However, he soon shook his head. To transform the entire reincarnation bridge into immortal energy, one would need to enter the Immortal Realm and undergo prolonged cultivation.

Otherwise, even if he absorbed all the immortal essence outside Star River Mansion, it would be impossible.

"Alas..." Luo Tian sighed deeply. Then he turned his gaze to the Splitting Heaven Spear, which had undergone significant changes. Its entire body shimmered with golden brilliance, radiating an overwhelming aura.

"It actually possesses a trace of immortal power!" A smile returned to Luo Tian's face as he gently caressed the spear. His eyes sparkled with satisfaction.

"Next, let's see what trials await us. This变态 trial might even challenge the Epoch Lords! After all, this is the trial for admitting external disciples into Star River Mansion!" Luo Tian sighed again, his gaze filled with anticipation. He pushed open the golden door and stepped inside.

"Boom...!" A tremor spread outward. As Luo Tian steadied himself, a thunderous sound echoed in his ears.

The wind howled, tousling Luo Tian's hair. The surrounding scenery shifted into an endless grassland, momentarily lifting his spirits. However, the dark clouds overhead spoiled the view.

A heavy atmosphere radiated from the black clouds, as if heralding an impending storm.

"Haha, it's been a while since fresh arrivals came!" As Luo Tian furrowed his brow, laughter echoed in his ears.

"Who?" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed. He turned toward the source of the sound, sensing an ominous presence within the swirling clouds.

"Crack..." A streak of blue lightning descended from the clouds toward Luo Tian. The violent energy made his eyes narrow, and he vanished from the spot.

"Boom..." Dust surged upward as a deep crater formed where Luo Tian had stood moments before.

"Your speed is decent, but how many more can you withstand? You can't dodge them all! If you endure ninety-nine thunderbolts, this trial is considered passed!" The voice spoke playfully again. The clouds churned as more blue lightning descended.

"Is this thunder comparable to a heavenly tribulation?" Luo Tian's lips curled into a smile as he rushed forward, actively charging toward the storm.

Suddenly, a numbing sensation coursed through Luo Tian's body. His hair stood on end as the lightning energy danced across his form. His invincible physique glowed with golden light.

"Tsk tsk, a formidable body. Unfortunately..." The voice spoke playfully again before golden lightning surged from the darkened grassland, striking Luo Tian.

"Truly remarkable thunder!" Luo Tian chuckled, finding this trial surprisingly simple. He leaped again to meet the golden lightning capable of harming even a near-king.

The thunder clashed with Luo Tian, his body still glowing with golden light. The lightning energy danced around him before vanishing.

"Strangely, I wonder if the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword could evolve a third lightning strike!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with anticipation as he gazed at the dark clouds, murmuring to himself.

"Huh? You're surprisingly skilled with lightning. How could such a level of punishment not affect you?" A voice of confusion echoed again, followed by red lightning descending. The overwhelming power made Luo Tian feel a slight tension, but his heart was filled with excitement.

The red lightning was blood-red and stood out against the vast grassland. The aura of the thunderstorm made Luo Tian's body tremble slightly.

"This trial is truly变态. Who could withstand it? Unless an Epoch Lord came, even a powerful being who had lived two lives would be killed by this trial's second stage!" Luo Tian mused, secretly grateful for his Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword. Otherwise, even with his invincible physique, he wouldn't have survived this punishment.

Red light flickered. Luo Tian felt a tingling sensation throughout his body, though the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword absorbed most of the lightning energy. However, as a conductor, he also endured some of it.

"Damn it! What are you made of? I don't believe I can kill you today!" As Luo Tian attempted to sense any changes in the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, a furious voice echoed from within the clouds.

The dark clouds churned. A massive foot with scales emerged from the black clouds, followed by a colossal body appearing in Luo Tian's vision.

"What is this thing?" Luo Tian gazed at the creature, which had a dragon tail but otherwise resembled a large lizard. He recalled an ancient legend: some creatures with even a trace of dragon blood could transform into dragons after enduring heavenly tribulations, though the chances of success were slim and most failed, being destroyed by the storm.

Yet some bizarre creatures managed to transform into powerful anomalies after failure. Though they failed, they became even more terrifying with various special abilities.

"Unexpectedly, the legend is true!" Luo Tian's face showed astonishment as he gazed at the dragon-tailed lizard in the sky, speaking aloud.

"You have some knowledge. Indeed, I am a creature that failed to transform into a dragon but evolved instead!" The dragon-tailed lizard spoke in human language, its two large eyes flashing with arrogance.

"It was this heavenly tribulation that allowed me to master lightning power, enabling my body to produce various thunderstorms. You're doomed now!" The dragon-tailed lizard's voice carried arrogance as it spat out a streak of purple lightning from its mouth, rushing toward Luo Tian like true Purple Yuan Thunder. This was a thousand times stronger than the previous Zi Yuan thunderstorms Luo Tian had endured.

"Truly, I'm lucky to have met you. I hope you don't disappoint me!" Luo Tian's lips curled into a smile as he moved to meet the purple lightning again.

As before, the lightning energy danced across Luo Tian's body. Most was absorbed by the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword while a small portion passed through his entire body.

"Very challenging. I won't back down!" Seeing Luo Tian withstand another strike, the dragon-tailed lizard became enraged. It spat out a series of multicolored divine lightning from its mouth, one after another without giving Luo Tian any chance to catch his breath.

Luo Tian naturally didn't hold back, and the sound of collisions echoed throughout heaven and earth.

"One... ten... eighty..." Within a quarter of an hour, Luo Tian had endured eighty thunderbolts.

Though the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword absorbed most of the lightning energy, Luo Tian was now in a sorry state. After all, even small amounts accumulated over time. Each of these apocalyptic thunderbolts could threaten a near-king.

"Your mother! Is this even human?" The dragon-tailed lizard exhaled white smoke, its black eyes filled with disbelief as it gazed at Luo Tian, who seemed like a monster.

It had tested many people here over the years. This was the first time it had seen a non-Heavenly Dao realm powerhouse endure over eighty thunderbolts so effortlessly.

Previously, anyone it tested would be electrocuted to the point of crying and even some were killed outright. This kid was different; he only had torn clothes and a charred body, but suffered no real damage.

"Almost there... almost there!" Luo Tian's eyes shone brightly. He felt the power of the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword behind him. The third streak of purple lightning was gradually forming on its blade, almost fully凝聚. He looked up at the dragon-tailed lizard with longing.

"Such a blow to my pride!" Seeing Luo Tian's eager gaze, the dragon-tailed lizard's eyes almost burst into flames. It felt its dignity was severely insulted.

"This kid has no injuries at all, yet he dares to provoke me! If this is tolerable, what isn't? I can't tolerate it!" The dragon-tailed lizard's heart boiled with fury, its eyes turning red as it stared intently at Luo Tian.

"I'll fight you! I don't believe I can't kill you!" The dragon-tailed lizard roared, spitting out a seven-colored lightning dragon.

"Roar..." At the moment the seven-colored lightning appeared, Luo Tian's body trembled involuntarily.

"Destroy everything! This thunderstorm could annihilate anything!" Luo Tian's mind shook as he felt the terrifying energy of the seven-colored lightning. After a brief hesitation, he bit his lip and rushed toward the seven-colored lightning.

"Suicide!" Seeing Luo Tian make no defensive measures, the dragon-tailed lizard sneered.

This seven-colored lightning was its ultimate technique, evolved from the lightning it had cultivated over years. Even it had only managed to produce seven of them. The dragon-tailed lizard was confident that even a Heavenly Dao realm powerhouse would suffer heavy injuries against this seven-colored lightning.

As the dragon-tailed lizard sneered, Luo Tian collided with the seven-colored lightning. What followed was a scene that made the dragon-tailed lizard almost lose its eyes.

"How... how is this possible..." The dragon-tailed lizard stammered, gazing at Luo Tian who was bathed in lightning and seemed to have devoured the seven-colored lightning.

"Thank you..." The laughter echoed, making the dragon-tailed lizard grit its teeth in fury.

Chapter 1707: Altar Trial ()

The seven-colored lightning enveloped Luo Tian's body, causing him to tremble. Though only part of it was endured, it still made Luo Tian's body shake violently. The powerful physique emitted a scent of charred flesh.

"This... this is possible? You're not even dead?" Seeing Luo Tian, though battered and wounded, still intact, the dragon-tailed lizard's black eyes were filled with disbelief.

Especially when Luo Tian said "Thank you," it was a blatant provocation for the dragon-tailed lizard, making it unbearable.

"One bolt won't kill you. Let's try two!" Seeing Luo Tian spitting blood, the dragon-tailed lizard took another deep breath and spat out two streaks of seven-colored lightning. They pierced through the sky, carrying powerful energy as they descended upon Luo Tian.

"Again?" Though in a sorry state, seeing the two seven-colored dragons, Luo Tian's face showed excitement.

"Probably after absorbing these two, the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword will evolve!" Luo Tian murmured to himself, then leaped upward again toward the seven-colored lightning.

"Ah..." The seven-colored lightning struck Luo Tian's body, spreading a destructive energy throughout his entire being. It fiercely refined Luo Tian's flesh and soul, but it was instantly absorbed by the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword.

"Boom..." The next moment, Luo Tian's body was completely charred and fell onto the overturned grassland.

The next seven-colored lightning struck instantly, colliding with Luo Tian's body that resembled charcoal.

It was too strong. Even an Epoch Lord would find it challenging to withstand, and Luo Tian could only rely on his physique and soul. Compared to an Epoch Lord, he was still far behind.

"This time, you're dead! Ha ha! Daring to oppose me, this is your fate!" The dragon-tailed lizard stood on the sky with its massive body, laughing wildly.

"Buzz..." However, a series of buzzing sounds echoed, causing the dragon-tailed lizard's voice to stop abruptly. Its black eyes looked at Luo Tian who appeared like charcoal, barely recognizable as a human.

A surge of vitality spread across the charcoal-like Luo Tian. Then, a series of cracking sounds echoed in the open grassland as the black outer skin slowly peeled off. Luo Tian's body appeared before the dragon-tailed lizard.

"Thank you..." Luo Tian's pale face showed excitement as he gazed at the dragon-tailed lizard.

Luo Tian's reason for his excitement was simple: at this moment, the third streak of purple lightning on the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword had finally formed. An overwhelming aura radiated from it, even making Luo Tian feel its immense power.

"It definitely surpasses an Epoch Treasure!" Luo Tian's heart was filled with excitement. He hadn't expected such a fortunate gain, not only passing the second trial so easily but also allowing the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword to gather another lightning streak. As for how much it had evolved, he didn't know.

"Your mother!" The dragon-tailed lizard saw Luo Tian alive and well again, its eyes filled with fury. Its massive body trembled in anger. However, it eventually had no choice but to give up. It had seen through this kid; he was faking it. If it unleashed more thunderbolts, there would be no use since it couldn't kill Luo Tian even with two. At this point, the dragon-tailed lizard had only four seven-colored lightning left and couldn't unleash them all on Luo Tian.

"Go... you've passed!" The dragon-tailed lizard roared, then spat out a golden door that appeared in the sky.

After doing this, the dragon-tailed lizard dove back into the clouds, feeling extremely委屈. For years, it had never encountered a test-taker so变态. It was extremely annoyed.

"Master, you still have several more to unleash!" Luo Tian wasn't giving up, feeling this dragon-tailed lizard was a living treasure. It was a treasure for the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword's upgrade. If he didn't squeeze it, Luo Tian felt he would be betraying himself.

"Go... I said you've passed. Don't push it, believe me, I'll swallow you!" The dragon-tailed lizard roared from within the clouds.

"Master, I believe you're a principled master. If you said ninety-nine, it's ninety-nine. I'll do it next!" Luo Tian spoke earnestly, like an indomitable youth.

"I want to obtain the qualification of external disciple in Star River Mansion through my own strength. Please, master, grant me this!" Luo Tian kept speaking without hesitation. The dragon-tailed lizard's strength was considerable, but it wasn't enough to make Luo Tian fear. Besides, the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword had just evolved slightly, and Luo Tian wanted to see its power. There was no one else to test it.

"I told you to go!" The dragon-tailed lizard refused to unleash more thunderbolts, standing in the clouds and responding angrily.

"Master..."

"Go..."

Luo Tian's endless chatter made him seem like Zheng Xin incarnate, never stopping his mouth. He hoped the dragon-tailed lizard would unleash more thunderbolts again. However, the dragon-tailed lizard was so annoyed by Luo Tian's words that it had no intention of doing so. Finally, realizing it couldn't win against Luo Tian, it chose to remain silent.

It was委屈. The dragon-tailed lizard had never felt such委屈 before. It hadn't expected to meet a weird person like Luo Tian. Previously, no test-taker wished to pass quickly. This bastard actually wanted to be struck by lightning.

"Master, are you afraid? Are you scared? Don't fear. You're a powerful being. Hurry up and strike me down!" Luo Tian persisted, continuously speaking.

"Dammit, I can't stand it anymore!" After Luo Tian had been talking for half an hour, a furious voice echoed behind him. The spirit of Star River Mansion appeared behind Luo Tian without hesitation and kicked his butt, sending him flying toward the golden door leading to the next trial.

"Boom..." In Star River Mansion, even if Luo Tian was strong, he couldn't match the spirit. His body flew out and crashed into the golden door.

The buzzing echoed, and in an instant, Luo Tian was lying on the ground. Then his body suddenly jumped up, looking around.

"Hmm?" He then noticed he was on a golden altar that was dozens of zhang in length and width.

Golden inscriptions flowed across the altar, emitting an unusual aura that made Luo Tian frown slightly.

"This is the third trial?" Luo Tian frowned, then looked around. The area surrounding the altar was vacuum-like, and beyond it were several small altars arranged around his own. The only difference was their colors compared to the golden altar under his feet.

"It seems there's a fresh offering!" A low voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears. The ancient altar emitted a series of buzzes, and three figures appeared in three directions around Luo Tian.

With the head of a sheep and the body of a human, they wore three ancient Daoist robes. Their bodies radiated strange energy that made Luo Tian puzzled.

"Endure for one hour, and this trial is passed!" The low voice echoed again as the three sheep-headed elders spoke to Luo Tian.

After saying this, the three sheep-headed elders waved their staffs. Waves of energy radiated from the staffs, emitting a scorching atmosphere that made Luo Tian's heart jump slightly.

"Buzz..." Before Luo Tian could react, a massive fireball shot out from the three staffs of the elders toward Luo Tian.

"What is this? Heavenly fire?" Luo Tian's lips twitched, his eyes filled with shock as he saw three fireballs flying toward him from different directions.

The three fireballs seemed slow, but they reached Luo Tian's front in an instant. A strong sense of crisis made Luo Tian's face change.

"This isn't just heavenly fire. It has a trace of immortal power! Although the speed is fast, it's still not faster than me!" Luo Tian smiled and didn't hesitate. His feet generated waves, attempting to dodge the fireballs.

"Buzz..." However, Luo Tian's face turned grim. The golden altar beneath his feet emitted waves, making his legs feel like they were filled with lead.

"Dammit!" Luo Tian cursed under his breath. He couldn't fly, so he chose to run, moving toward another direction.

"One... two..." Even by running, Luo Tian's speed was fast. He quickly dodged the first two fireballs.

"Boom..." However, he was hit by the third fireball. The scorching fireball instantly exploded on his body.

"Zhi..." A scent of charred flesh spread. Luo Tian inhaled sharply, his body beginning to char over a large area. His newly changed clothes were instantly burned by the scorching flames.

"Dammit!" Luo Tian cursed again, looking at the fire still burning on his body and cursing.

"Isn't it just fire? Who hasn't had it? I won't dodge this time!" Luo Tian gritted his teeth and, with the seven-colored mark on his forehead glowing.

"Xiao Qi, swallow it!" Luo Tian roared, standing bare-chested and allowing the overwhelming flames to rush toward him.

"Buzz..." The seven-colored fire flickered, then enveloped Luo Tian's entire body. Instantly, it collided with the three massive fireballs.

This time, the overwhelming flames didn't explode but were directly absorbed by the seven-colored fire. In an instant, it merged with the seven-colored fire surrounding Luo Tian.

Chapter 1708: The Real Test ()

"Boom..." The flame containing a trace of immortal power seemed to become fuel for the seven-colored fire, causing Luo Tian's entire body's seven-colored fire to surge upward.

"Come on!" Luo Tian stood in place and shouted at the three sheep-headed elders with a fierce expression.

"Kid, this is just the beginning!" The three sheep-headed elders spoke simultaneously, their voices overlapping perfectly.

"Cut the crap. The big stupid lizard from before said the same thing, and it still sent me through in the end. Hurry up, I'm on a schedule!" Luo Tian shouted loudly.

"Buzz..." The fireballs rose again, but this time their power was even stronger than before. This made Luo Tian feel a sense of alarm, his face showing a trace of seriousness.

"Xiao Qi, can you handle it?" Luo Tian asked Xiao Qi mentally, as he felt the power of the purple fireball was no less than that of Xiao Qi's flames.

"Leave it to me!" Xiao Qi spoke confidently, calming Luo Tian slightly. He didn't move his body and stood proudly on the golden altar.

"Buzz..." The next moment, three purple fireballs thundered toward him. The scorching temperature seemed to ignite everything, making Luo Tian's eyes narrow.

"Ah..." Xiao Qi's figure separated from Luo Tian and his seven-colored braid swayed. He opened his mouth, drawing in a powerful suction.

At the moment Xiao Qi opened his mouth, the three massive fireballs encountered their match and went out like a extinguished flame. They were sucked into Xiao Qi's mouth.

"I want more!" After swallowing the three fireballs, Xiao Qi patted his belly with satisfaction and looked at the three sheep-headed elders standing nearby.

"Human fire!" The three elders gazed at Xiao Qi, their aged eyes showing surprise.

"Unbelievable. This kid's luck is really good. He managed to subdue human fire!" The three elders' eyes showed admiration as they looked at Luo Tian.

"Human fire is rare even in the Immortal Realm. I didn't expect it to evolve into a form here in this small world. This kid's luck is truly unparalleled!" In the small room, the spirit of Star River Mansion showed a trace of admiration.

Xiao Qi burped. The Heavenly Fire was like the thunderstorms for the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, both being great nourishment.

"It's grown a bit taller! This level should be easy too!" Luo Tian smiled as he looked at Xiao Qi, who had grown a little taller.

"Send me to the next level. This fire is useless for me!" Luo Tian spoke boldly at the three sheep-headed elders.

"Think you're so lucky. We said this was just the beginning. It seems we need to enter the hardest mode early!" The three sheep-headed elders exchanged glances, and waves of energy radiated from them.

In Luo Tian's surprised gaze, the three sheep-headed elders split into two and then four. In an instant, they filled all the colored altars around Luo Tian, totaling eighteen.

"More numbers, so what? It's still just fire. It's just food for Xiao Qi!" Luo Tian showed disdain, still standing in place.

However, the subsequent waves made Luo Tian's eyes blink slightly. A sheep-headed elder raised a staff in his hand, emitting an icy chill. A blade of coldness flew out from the elder's front toward Luo Tian.

On the other side, another sheep-headed elder conjured a black sphere. Though it was a ball, Luo Tian felt the immense suction coming from it. What was it? It wasn't a sphere but a black hole.

As Luo Tian was stunned, the four sides of the altar were filled with attacks that radiated overwhelming power, rushing toward Luo Tian.

"This one can't be eaten!" Xiao Qi's small body trembled slightly. His seven-colored braid instantly drooped, his eyes showing fear. He quickly transformed into a seven-colored mark and appeared on Luo Tian's forehead.

"You're fast, kid!" Luo Tian's lips twitched. He then kicked off his legs and dodged in all directions.

"Boom..." The icy chill eroded Luo Tian's entire body, making his movements slower. Immediately after, the black hole that could devour anything collided with Luo Tian's body.

Luo Tian's body twisted in front of the black hole, losing a large amount of blood and flesh. He was sweating profusely but didn't stop.

"Uncle Sheep, I was just joking earlier! You can take it slow!" Luo Tian shouted in panic, regretting his previous arrogance.

"Arrogance has no good end!" At this moment, Luo Tian's thoughts were on Xu Liyi and others who had mocked Diao Dezhu.

The幽冥鬼步 (Yin Ghost Step) was now at its peak, but the heavy feeling under his feet made his speed significantly slower. Although he dodged most of them, he was still hit by the ice blade and black hole occasionally.

However, Luo Tian felt relieved. The eighteen sheep-headed elders' attacks weren't tracking; otherwise, he would have been instantly destroyed by the eighteen assaults.

"One hour... two hours..." Time passed slowly. Luo Tian had endured half an hour, but for him, it felt like a day. His mind was highly concentrated, and his injuries kept worsening, with numerous wounds covering his body.

"I can't continue like this; I'll definitely be played to death!" Luo Tian murmured to himself, dodging while thinking about how to break this situation.

"Movement techniques are no good. The Yin Ghost Step is a top-tier technique in the Nine Domains, but it can only dodge most of them!"

"This trial tests speed?" Luo Tian was puzzled as he looked at the eighteen sheep-headed elders standing on the altar.

"Speed. I can't achieve it now. If speed is no good, my physique can't withstand it either. Then attack!" Luo Tian thought while being hit twice more, making his face paler.

"One hour left. I'll attack this time!" Luo Tian's face showed a cold glint. He then summoned the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, with three-colored lightning swirling around it.

"Crack..." Luo Tian's hands formed a seal. He stabilized his body and poured Epoch Power into the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword.

The blue sword emitted a terrifying cold light, carrying Luo Tian's anger. It became a streak of light and rushed toward one of the ram-headed elders.

A humming sound echoed. The next moment, a barrier suddenly rose, enveloping the altar where Luo Tian stood, as if to block the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword's attack.

"This barrier is no simple thing! But..." Luo Tian looked at the rising golden barrier, a smile on his face.

"If it were before, an Epoch Treasure would have taken several hits to break through this barrier. But now? A chicken and a dog!" Luo Tian's voice carried disdain as he watched the blue divine light clash with the golden barrier.

"Crack..." The next moment, a crackling sound echoed on the altar. The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword pierced into the golden barrier but didn't break through, instead appearing to be nailed within it.

"Do you know this trial's essence is testing attack?" The spirit of Star River Mansion smiled, its eyes showing surprise.

"This sword isn't simple. It's almost as good as a pseudo-immortal artifact!" The spirit then focused on the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, its voice filled with surprise.

"Lightning swirling around. I've heard of a sword like this in the Immortal Realm!" The spirit then became puzzled.

As the spirit of Star River Mansion, responsible for admitting external disciples, it had heard of the Heavenly Dao Sect and knew that the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword was a revered treasure of that once glorious sect. However, the spirit never thought it would connect to the Heavenly Dao Sect. After all, it considered Luo Tian merely a strong cultivator from the three thousand small worlds, far behind the Heavenly Dao Sect's former masters.

At the same time Luo Tian unleashed the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, the eighteen sheep-headed elders' attacks also pierced through the barrier toward Luo Tian. Eighteen directions completely sealed all of Luo Tian's escape routes.

"Dammit! Why don't you block their attacks!" Luo Tian cursed in his heart, then started running again.

"Boom..." This time, Luo Tian's attack ended with being hit by three ice blades. The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword returned to his head.

"Try again!" Luo Tian had grasped some patterns. The black hole was something he couldn't touch, but the ice blade was manageable since his Xiao Qi's fire protected him. It didn't harm Luo Tian much.

"Buzz..." The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword again emitted a terrifying light, rushing toward the barrier it had previously pierced.

This time, it was unstoppable. The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword followed the first crack and broke through the barrier, appearing before the ram-headed elder with dazzling cold light.

"Pu..." Like cutting tofu, the blue divine light pierced into the elder's throat.

The next moment, the elder's figure vanished in Luo Tian's vision, disintegrating into fragments and disappearing from the altar.

"Shadow Body!" Surprise filled Luo Tian's eyes. He hadn't expected this elder to be a shadow body.

The divine essence flowed, and the fragments of the ram-headed elder's image became a streak of light. It instantly rushed into the barrier, imprinting itself in Luo Tian's mind. His body trembled slightly, and his face showed great joy.

Chapter 1709: Catching Up ()

"What is this?" Luo Tian's mind shook. He felt the imprint of the ram-headed elder, his face showing a trace of joy.

"Star Stepping Step!" A series of incomplete incantations appeared in Luo Tian's mind. However, they weren't complete; it was just an imprint and couldn't be cultivated.

"Would killing all these sheep-headed elders give me a complete Star Stepping Step incantation?" Luo Tian's eyes showed anticipation.

"Star Stepping Step, a movement technique of Star River Mansion in the Immortal Realm. All external disciples can learn the first half, and only inner disciples have the chance to practice the second half!" Luo Tian recalled the introduction of Star Stepping Step imprinted in his mind.

Although this Star Stepping Step wasn't a high-level movement technique in the Immortal Realm, it was no less than an Epoch Lord's methods in the Nine Domains.

"Kill!" A smile appeared on Luo Tian's face. He then activated the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword again, rushing toward another sheep-headed elder.

"Pu..." With the first strike came the second. The next moment, the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword pierced through the weakened barrier and stabbed another sheep-headed elder. There was no surprise, and an imprint appeared in Luo Tian's mind again.

"It's not enough!" This one was just a simple way to step, without the flow of Epoch Power.

But this imprint had cost Luo Tian an equivalent price. His body lost a large amount of flesh due to one black hole.

"Continue!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with intensity. He activated the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword again, continuously slashing at the sheep-headed elders standing on various altars.

"One... two..." Time passed slowly. One by one, the sheep-headed elders were killed by the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword. Meanwhile, Luo Tian's injuries decreased, and the martial arts technique imprinted in his mind became more complete.

"Boom..." Finally, the last sheep-headed elder disintegrated. Luo Tian sighed deeply and lay on the altar, his body covered in wounds of various sizes.

"Good thing I found a way. Otherwise, if I didn't attack these sheep-headed elders, this trial would have been impossible to pass!" Luo Tian murmured to himself.

"Star Stepping Step!" Luo Tian lay on the altar, recovering his injuries while thinking about the movement technique imprinted in his mind.

"Star Stepping Step, a signature technique of Star River Mansion. When mastered, one step forward becomes a meteor, moving at incredible speed!" A smile appeared on Luo Tian's face. Although the description of this technique was simple, he knew it was a technique from the Immortal Realm. He had some understanding of the Immortal Realm, which was that its rules were constrained. In the Immortal Realm, to fly one needed to reach the level of an immortal. Moving at meteor-like speed was already considered very fast in the Immortal Realm.

"Dammit..." However, as he studied it, his lips curled into a frown and he cursed under his breath.

Because this Star Stepping Step couldn't be activated with Epoch Power but required immortal energy instead, which left Luo Tian speechless.
