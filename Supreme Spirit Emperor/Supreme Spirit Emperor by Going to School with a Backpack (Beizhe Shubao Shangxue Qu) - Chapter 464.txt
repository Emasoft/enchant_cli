“Correct, I am Luo Tian!” Luo Tian spoke softly, nodding as his gaze shifted to Zuo Qiu Ming. “Elder Brother, I’ve come for a physical examination. Please try to exercise restraint!”

Luo Tian’s words caused Zuo Qiu Ming’s face to flush. Indeed, he had been indulging in nightly pleasures recently—recovering from his poisoning and driven by his desire to have a child with Xue Yushan, they had been tirelessly “creating life.”

“Luo Tian, yield your outer sect spot. Whatever conditions you demand, I will fulfill them!” Zhang Xing sneered as he stepped forward, his gaze dismissive. “I will satisfy your every wish!”

“Ah? You’d grant me any condition?” Luo Tian’s eyes met Zhang Xing’s.

“I too would accept one condition,” a voice interjected. “If you relinquish this spot, I’ll grant your wish—immortal qi stones, women… listen to me. You gain nothing by holding this spot; the inner sect’s trials are beyond your strength!” Qian Luofeng spoke with pride, feigning concern but laced with condescension.

“Such a rustic fool! Just tossing away an inner sect spot!” the crowd murmured, their eyes flicking to Luo Tian.

“I can also grant you one condition… I too…” sensing Luo Tian’s hesitation, the crowd erupted in clamor.

“Gentlemen, if you wish to quarrel, I’ll propose my conditions. Whoever fulfills them shall claim this spot. Rest assured, I’ll convince my elder brother to endorse my decision!” Luo Tian smiled, his gaze sweeping the assembly.

“Luo Tian, don’t be reckless!” Zuo Qiu Ming’s face darkened as he interjected.

“Elder Brother, don’t worry—I know what I’m doing!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed as he addressed Zuo Qiu Ming.

“Then what conditions?” the crowd surged with excitement, speculating. A peasant’s demands? Though costly, any price paled against the inner sect’s prize.

“Whoever can elevate my cultivation to Immortal King shall claim this spot!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze sweeping the crowd.

“Cough… cough…” Zuo Qiu Ming choked, nearly suffocated by his own saliva.

“Did you say what?” the crowd’s disbelief was palpable, some nearly collapsing.

“Are you mocking us?!” The prodigies’ faces darkened. If they could elevate others to Immortal King, why bother vying for inner sect spots—why not ascend themselves and conquer the heavens?

“This is indeed challenging… a formidable task for you all,” Luo Tian nodded, his gaze returning to the crowd.

“Choose a feasible demand, or you’ll regret mocking us!” Qian Luofeng’s eyes froze.

“Kill your sect master and let me take his place. I once harbored a wish to become a sect leader!” Luo Tian declared solemnly.

“Go to hell!”
“Dare mock us? You dare dream of leading our Luofeng Sect?” The crowd roared in fury, their patience shattered by Luo Tian’s repeated provocations.

“Hum…” As the crowd erupted, an icy aura suddenly radiated from Luo Tian, altering his appearance.

“Boom…” Killing intent erupted, sweeping the heavens and earth. A bone-chilling chill froze the crowd’s gazes, as if they’d fallen into an endless abyss. Wails of souls surrounded them, even Zuo Qiu Ming shuddered involuntarily.

“This…!” All eyes locked on Luo Tian, perceiving him as a bloodstained demon emerging from hell.

“I won’t provoke you, but I am no pushover. Don’t toy with fire—many have died by my hand. Hope you won’t be the next!” His voice echoed, chilling their bones. The oppressive aura vanished, and Luo Tian and Long Zaitian disappeared from view.

“He’s stained with blood! At such a young age, how many have he slain?” Zuo Qiu Ming mused, curiosity piqued by Luo Tian’s past.

“Huff…!” The prodigies gasped, sweat drenching their brows. That scene had left an indelible shadow.

Chapter 1800: No Surrender

“Terrifying… terrifying! If he’d attacked me directly, I’d have no strength to resist!” Their minds reeled. Though they prided themselves as ruthless killers, their own killing intent paled compared to Luo Tian’s.

No longer viewing Luo Tian as a peasant, they now regarded him as a true adversary.

“Gentlemen, if no matters remain, you may depart. If you wish to stay, I welcome you—but remember, this is my domain; don’t cause trouble,” Zuo Qiu Ming smiled. The stronger Luo Tian grew, the better for him.

After speaking, Zuo Qiu Ming rose, intending to subdue them. Unexpectedly, Luo Tian had already done so.

“He’s merely a killer; by rules, he must undergo outer sect trials before entering the inner. If we eliminate him there, we still have a chance!” Their resolve returned, eyes fierce.

“Heroic savior! You were incredible—nearly scared me to death!” Long Zaitian praised Luo Tian as they walked the road.

“Enough flattery. Focus on managing Tianlong City. I’ll brew some pills for you, boosting your strength—don’t disappoint me or Elder Brother!” Luo Tian smacked Long Zaitian’s head.

For days, no one troubled Luo Tian. Though Tianlong City bustled, nothing momentous occurred—everyone seemed to be gathering strength for the Tianlong Sect’s selection.

Luo Tian spent days refining pills, freely accessing the city lord’s elixirs, cementing his reputation as a second-tier immortal cultivator in Tianlong City.

“A prodigy both powerful and a pill artisan! A true celestial talent!”
“Haven’t you heard? A group of sect disciples once sought Luo Tian’s trouble, only to be subdued by him—sitting motionless for half a day!” The city’s people gossiped endlessly.

Time flowed steadily, seven days passing unnoticed. Under eager anticipation, the day of Tianlong Sect’s opening selection arrived.

Luo Tian rose slowly, stepping out of his room. Zuo Qiu Ming and Xue Yushan waited by the door, equally excited—today marked their return to Tianlong Sect.

“Elder Brother! Forgive my delay!” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Zuo Qiu Ming. Long Youlan skipped joyfully to their side.

“Let’s go!” Zuo Qiu Ming’s face bore boldness; now both he and Xue Yushan, at the late仙 stage, were eligible to rejoin Tianlong Sect.

“Heroic savior! Remember to return often!” Long Zaitian and the city lord’s entourage stood at the gates, bowing respectfully. Though Long Zaitian hadn’t yet reached仙 stage, he’d attained the Daoist realm these days. His charm and eloquence earned him the city lord’s favor.

“Nine, I originally intended to grant you the city lord position, but your nature is too rigid. Don’t resent me; when you reach the middle仙 stage, I’ll personally escort you to Tianlong Mountain!” Zuo Qiu Ming patted the shoulder of the guard commander who’d once detained Long Zaitian.

“City Lord, my life was saved; your orders I’ll obey!” The commander bowed.

“Let’s go!” Zuo Qiu Ming sighed, hoping all would proceed smoothly—then he’d never return here.

Luo Tian and four others strolled the road, while people bustled past them toward the vast Tianlong Mountain.

“Luo Tian!” The crowd spotted Luo Tian and Zuo Qiu Ming.

“During the selection, I’ll show you!” Zhang Xing’s gaze was icy as he surveyed Luo Tian.

“Finally, I can avenge!” Yuan Tianjiao stood in his courtyard, polishing his sword. Its cold light flickered as he sheathed it.

“Let’s go!” In Luoxue Inn, Gu Qianxue stood coldly in black robes, accompanied by her maid.

Soon, Tianlong City emptied as many sought to witness the spectacle—Tianlong Mountain was no place for commoners, only accessible during selection.

They reached Tianlong Sect’s grand gate, where a floating platform hovered above.

“Tianlong Battlefield—this stage appears every selection. Your trial position is here!” Zuo Qiu Ming spoke softly.

“Back then, your elder brother dominated others here, becoming the thirty-ninth Triple Crown King!” Xue Yushan reminisced, recalling Zuo Qiu Ming’s glory.

“Don’t heed your sister-in-law’s lies; she let me win during the soul trial,” Zuo Qiu Ming shook his head.

“Enough—wait here. I’ll visit old friends above, and if you pass the outer sect trial, I’ll personally recommend you to the inner!” Zuo Qiu Ming spoke softly before soaring into the sky with Xue Yushan.

“Ah, it’s City Lord Zuo!” The crowd saw Zuo Qiu Ming and his wife flying toward the battlefield.

“Zuo Qiu Ming?” The people on the battlefield stirred, gazing at him.

“Why’s he here? Not resting in Tianlong City but coming here?” Several middle-aged men marveled. They were disciples of the Eight Elders, now vying for leadership positions after their masters retreated.

“Genius is genius—no matter the adversity, there’s always a chance!” The central elder sighed. This was Tianlong Sect’s Grandmaster Li Changfeng.

“Grandmaster Li, your sect truly has talent—such a powerhouse becomes city lord!” A senior remarked lazily, reclining on his dragon-embossed chair. This was Zhao Tiancheng of the Di Sect.

“Indeed, Tianlong Sect is thriving!” Another elder smiled, manipulating his chair’s strange material.

“Boom…” As they spoke, Zuo Qiu Ming and Xue Yushan landed on the battlefield, bowing to Li Changfeng.

“City Lord Zuo Qiu Ming of Tianlong Sect reports for Grandmaster!” Zuo Qiu Ming announced.

“Zhenghao, prepare a seat for Zuo Senior!” Li Changfeng ordered the middle-aged man beside him.

“Master, I didn’t expect Zuo Senior to come; I forgot to prepare a seat for him!” The man, Ke Zhenghao, was Li Changfeng’s disciple and Zuo Qiu Ming’s greatest rival. Without Zuo Qiu Ming, Ke Zhenghao dominated Tianlong Sect, widely believed the next Grandmaster.

“Hum…” Ke Zhenghao’s palm emitted a ripple, summoning a stool.

“Senior Zuo, please endure this seat!” Ke Zhenghao smiled, assuming Zuo Qiu Ming had been dormant in Tianlong City and poisoned—powerless to challenge him.

Ke Zhenghao hadn’t expected Zuo Qiu Ming’s return, let alone his boldness. A bad premonition stirred; he tested Zuo Qiu Ming’s resolve.

“Yushan, long time no see! Sit here with me!” Ke Zhenghao noticed Xue Yushan beside Zuo Qiu Ming, offering her a seat.

“Yushan, years apart, still so beautiful! I’ve never forgotten you!” Ke Zhenghao’s words drew a lecherous middle-aged man, who addressed Xue Yushan.

Xue Yushan was renowned in Tianlong Sect—her beauty and her father, one of the Eight Elders. Marrying her meant securing an Elder’s vote. Many had pursued her in youth.

“Humiliation, naked humiliation!” First Ke Zhenghao gave him a stool; then openly flirted with his wife. Who could endure this?

“Thank you, Senior Duan!” Zuo Qiu Ming wasn’t one to back down. He approached the lecherous Duan Chengfeng.

“Zuo Qiu Ming, this seat is for Yushan—no for you! Sit on your stool!” Duan Chengfeng laughed, but Zuo Qiu Ming stepped toward him.

“Make way! I claim this seat!” Zuo Qiu Ming spoke coldly, his tone霸道.

“If I don’t?” Duan Chengfeng’s face darkened; he was late仙, years ahead. Zuo Qiu Ming was merely mid仙—poisoned and dying.

“Then I’ll take it myself!” Zuo Qiu Ming glared at Duan Chengfeng’s disdain, sneering.

Chapter 1801: The Selection Begins

“Then I’ll take it myself!” Zuo Qiu Ming glared at Duan Chengfeng’s disdain, sneering.

“Haha! Zuo Qiu Ming, still think you’re the old Zuo Qiu Ming? You’ve sunk to city lord—why not be a chicken head? What qualifications do you have now to dare mock me? I’ll stay here; can you move me? Come on, hit me!” Duan Chengfeng laughed, his gaze scornful.

“Listen to me—go sit on that stool! That’s your place!” Duan Chengfeng sneered, incessantly.

Zuo Qiu Ming snorted, then swept his sleeve toward Duan Chengfeng. This strike was full-force; even Duan Chengfeng, despite his defense, couldn’t withstand it. He hadn’t expected Zuo Qiu Ming to harm him.

“Smack!” Duan Chengfeng’s face contorted, his body and stool flying backward.

“Late仙!” The Tianlong Sect members, including Grandmaster Li Changfeng, gazed at Zuo Qiu Ming.

“How did he break the poison?” All faces bore confusion, staring at Zuo Qiu Ming’s overwhelming aura.

“I struck you—what of it?” Zuo Qiu Ming strode forward, snatching Duan Chengfeng’s stool and sitting.

“You… you…” Duan Chengfeng spat blood, pointing at Zuo Qiu Ming in disbelief.

“If you’re不服, come fight!” Zuo Qiu Ming sneered, while Xue Yushan smiled behind him.

“What’s happening?” The crowd below gaped, watching the event.

“Senior Duan of the Eight Elders—beaten by City Lord Zuo!” They murmured, watching Zuo Qiu Ming sit.

“Zuo Qiu Ming, you’ve gone too far!” Duan Chengfeng rose, his eyes fierce. Being humiliated by Zuo Qiu Ming in front of many was a blow to his pride, though he felt Zuo Qiu Ming’s strength. Yet Duan Chengfeng wasn’t easy to provoke.

Simultaneously, Duan Chengfeng was stunned—Zuo Qiu Ming’s poison was known even to Master Xuantan.

“Hum…” A hum rose from Duan Chengfeng’s head, a green sword hovering above him.

“You’ll use weapons? Want blood?” Zuo Qiu Ming coldly asked, rising again. His aura surged.

“Enough…” A cold scoff echoed in their ears, a pressure sweeping over them, subduing Duan Chengfeng’s sword back to his side.

“True仙!” Luo Tian stood at the battlefield, gazing at Li Changfeng rising. A terrifying pressure enveloped him, stronger than Zhao Tiancheng’s earlier. One finger could crush him.

“Terrifying True仙! In True仙’s presence, even the strongest late仙 are doomed!” The crowd below bore reverence, gazing at Li Changfeng on the battlefield.

True仙 were rare; seeing one was only possible in three major sects or great organizations.

When Li Changfeng stood, Zhao Tiancheng and the Iron Sect elder’s eyes flickered, their bodies twitching slightly before returning to normal.

“Why are you here? Let others mock you!” Li Changfeng rebuked, his gaze scanning Zuo Qiu Ming and Duan Chengfeng. He was surprised how Zuo Qiu Ming broke his poison, but also pleased—adding a late仙 to Tianlong Sect was beneficial before the war.

“Grandmaster, forgive us—we’re too bold!” Duan Chengfeng glared at Zuo Qiu Ming, teeth clenched.

“I’m too bold? You insulted my wife in front of many! Who could stomach it? If I hadn’t recovered, it would’ve been me who was humiliated!” Zuo Qiu Ming coldly replied, unflinching.

“Today’s the selection day! Stay put!” Li Changfeng scoffed, then sat. His gaze swept over柯正浩: “Begin!”

“Yes!”柯正浩 was still stunned by Zuo Qiu Ming’s poison-breaking and late仙 status.

Hearing Li Changfeng, they dared not provoke further. Zuo Qiu Ming sat without yielding his spot.

Though Zuo Qiu Ming’s master was missing, his wife Xue Yushan’s father remained—a powerful patron. Others said nothing.

Duan Chengfeng glared at the stool, choosing to stand instead—sitting was uncomfortable.

“Alright, now it’s time for Tianlong Sect to recruit disciples. I’ll share a good news: this selection differs from before!”

“Some of you may have heard—this time, not only Tianlong Sect recruits, but Di Sect and Iron Sect elders are here. Thus, you may choose to join Tianlong Sect or Di Sect or Iron Sect!”柯正浩 smiled, gazing down at Luo Tian.

“Our sect’s recruitment requires three criteria: body, soul, and combat power!”柯正浩 explained.

“Pass all three, and you enter Tianlong’s outer sect. If any of us find you worthy, you become Tianlong disciples immediately!”

“Of course, if Di Sect or Iron Sect elders find you worthy and invite you, you may join them—simple!”柯正浩 smiled, finishing his speech.

“Alright, those wishing to join the selection—come to Tianlong Battlefield!”柯正浩 ignored if they understood, speaking again.

“Hum…” As柯正浩’s words ended,一道道 light surged skyward toward the battlefield.

Though flying to the battlefield wasn’t part of the selection, they competed fiercely, pushing their speed to impress these masters.

Stars shimmered; a star bridge appeared. Zhang Xiaoxing, with arrogance, seemed to walk on stars, arriving at the battlefield.

“Tianxing Sect’s Zhang Xiaoxing pays respects to Grandmaster and elders!” Zhang Xiaoxing smiled, addressing Li Changfeng.

“Luofeng Sect’s Qian Luofeng pays respects to Tianlong Grandmaster and elders!” As Zhang Xiaoxing spoke, Qian Luofeng appeared simultaneously, his gaze respectful.

“Xuanshui Sect… Binghan Sect…” Others from various sects also greeted Li Changfeng with reverence.

“Good!” Li Changfeng and others smiled, gazing at the disciples arriving for selection.

The second wave included city lords and minor sects, like Yuan Tianjiao and Gu Qianxue.

Luo Tian and Long Youlan flew to the battlefield, exchanging glances with Zuo Qiu Ming and Xue Yushan before speaking.

“Alright, now it’s time for the first trial—body strength. Are you all ready?”柯正浩 smiled.

“Hum…” As柯正浩 spoke, the eight seated—including Zuo Qiu Ming—suddenly stood. An invisible ripple radiated from them, instantly enveloping the battlefield.

The immense pressure immediately crushed those on the battlefield. Some bent over, others fell to the ground.

“Luo Tian elder!” Long Youlan swayed, her body trembling under the pressure. Though she could endure it, this wasn’t a short battle.

“Endure for an hour; first trial passes!”柯正浩 smiled, addressing them.

“Long Youlan, if you can’t endure, I’ll help!” Luo Tian smiled, hoping to hone Long Youlan. In Tianlong Sect, she was naive compared to Longyin City—she needed trials.

“Plop… plop…” As time passed, pressure intensified. Many fell, their bodies cracking, blood staining the battlefield.

An hour had only passed half—many collapsed, never to rise again, sent back by the battlefield.

“Thousand… eight hundred…” Time flowed steadily; fewer than five hundred remained on the battlefield.

“Luo Tian elder, I can’t endure!” Long Youlan’s face paled, her body swaying. Sweat dripped from her cheeks.

“Hm!” Luo Tian nodded, sensing the pressure reached its limit for Daoist realm.

He grabbed Long Youlan’s hand, sending a ripple from himself. The mountain-like pressure vanished half.

Chapter 1802: Everyone, Leave!

“Hm?” Luo Tian’s face showed confusion as he glanced at Zuo Qiu Ming and Xue Yushan. He was about to help Long Youlan, but someone had acted first.

Zuo Qiu Ming gave a barely perceptible nod to Luo Tian, who smiled. This pressure was nothing for him.

“Having help is good!” Luo Tian mused, gazing at others—many stood awkwardly but persisted. Numbers dwindled.

“An hour’s up!”柯正浩 smiled, gazing at the five hundred remaining.

“Plop…” As柯正浩 spoke, someone collapsed, relief on their face, gasping.

Yet some stood proudly, refusing to move—like Zhang Xiaoxing, Qian Luofeng, Yuan Tianjiao. They sought to impress the eight who could elevate them to inner sect—this was their goal!

“Originally, it lasted half an hour; extending time added many more!” Li Changfeng smiled, watching those still standing. The fallen were mere cannon fodder for the war; those remaining were his focus.

“Hum…”柯正浩 and others understood this unspoken rule, their auras surged again, pressing the remaining over a hundred.

“Ah…” As pressure descended, someone screamed—this pressure threatened even early仙.

Instantly, many fell, faces filled with regret. Those still standing were all late仙—only Long Youlan remained.

Pressure kept rising, many late仙 fell, the battlefield’s people felt immense pressure—Luo Tian’s body slightly bent.

“Fifteen…!” Luo Tian still had leisure to count others.

“This pressure is terrifying!” Those sent down gazed at those on the battlefield, fear in their eyes.

“My heavens! There’s a Daoist realm there!” People noticed Long Youlan standing on the battlefield.

“What kind of prodigy is this? She withstands pressure that even late仙 can’t!”
“Wait—look who’s beside her!” People saw Luo Tian holding Long Youlan’s hand, sensing a ripple from him to her.

“It’s that Luo Tian—carrying two pressures!” People were stunned.

“Enduring two pressures? What use is that? A Daoist realm wastrel dares stand with me!” Zhang Xiaoxing sneered, sweat dripping as pressure increased.

As Zhang Xiaoxing sneered, an invisible ripple rushed toward Long Youlan—Zhang Xiaoxing aimed to send her down, indirectly targeting Luo Tian.

“Hm?” Luo Tian instantly felt the ripple approaching Long Youlan, his gaze cold.

Others noticed Zhang Xiaoxing’s move and saw an opportunity to humiliate Luo Tian.

Suddenly, the battlefield roared with waves, invisible ripples sweeping toward Luo Tian.

“Interesting!” Li Changfeng smiled, gazing at Luo Tian—unexpected events on the battlefield.

“Ungrateful!” Luo Tian held Long Youlan’s hand; she trembled, wanting to give up—she’d passed the trial. But seeing Luo Tian’s hand grip hers, she didn’t move.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed coldly, gazing at the ripples. When he noticed one was icy—his gaze turned bitter, looking at Gu Qianxue in black.

“Will you attack me too? Why?” Luo Tian felt a surge of resentment, though he knew Gu Qianxue might have issues. Yet her attack stung him.

“Go…!” Luo Tian roared, invisible ripples sweeping outward, his gaze icy toward the crowd.

“Crack…” Invisible collisions echoed on the battlefield, a ripple spreading from Luo Tian’s body.

“Rippling…!” Like waves colliding, the ripples from the prodigies sweeping toward Luo Tian vanished.

Wind blew, stirring their robes—everyone’s faces changed slightly.

“Since you want to play, I’ll play with you!” Luo Tian stood straight, one hand holding Long Youlan’s. Invisible ripples swept from his body again.

“Just you?” Zhang Xiaoxing and others sneered, disbelieving Luo Tian could withstand their pressure.

“Hum…” The hum echoed; next moment, Luo Tian’s aura swept outward, sweeping over them.

“Go!” Several prodigies roared, their auras surged—serpents of invisible power clashed with Luo Tian’s.

“Crush!” Seeing they could withstand pressure,柯正浩 and others felt their pride wounded. They raised hands, pressing downward.

“Damn!” Their faces changed instantly; bodies cracked, but they persisted.

“Down!” As they endured the pressure, a cold voice echoed on the battlefield.

“How?” They saw Luo Tian, who had been attacked, slowly moving his body and punching the battlefield ground.

“Crack…” The massive Tianlong Battlefield echoed, a powerful aura erupting toward Zhang Xiaoxing.

“Ah…” Zhang Xiaoxing and others roared, trying to escape Luo Tian’s aura but were crushed.

“Boom…” Next moment, Luo Tian’s unstoppable aura struck their bodies.

Bodies flew backward but couldn’t control themselves, collapsing under柯正浩 and Zuo Qiu Ming’s pressure.

With several falling, only three stood: Luo Tian, Long Youlan, and Gu Qianxue in black.

Gu Qianxue’s face bore confusion—she had attacked Luo Tian upon seeing him and Long Youlan holding hands. Yet she didn’t know others were defeated, but not her.

“This kid’s body—what is it made of? We released pressure, yet he only felt a little!”柯正浩 and others marveled.

“Is it over?” Luo Tian held Long Youlan’s hand—no matter late仙 or true仙, no one could kill him by aura alone. After all, he was the Epoch Lord in Nine Realms, possibly surpassing them in aura control.

“End it!” Li Changfeng smiled, gazing at Luo Tian—whatever his method, he was extraordinary.

“This kid’s body—I’ll take it for Iron Sect!” A lazy elder of Iron Sect, eyes flickering with excitement, gazed at Luo Tian.

Three major sects had distinct focuses: Tianlong Sect valued cultivation, Di Sect soul trials, and Iron Sect body strength. Seeing Luo Tian’s brilliance, the Iron Sect elder couldn’t resist.

“Senior Song, wait until after selection to recruit,” Zhao Tiancheng smiled.

“Damn!” As pressure lessened, Zhang Xiaoxing’s faces darkened—how could they fail to subdue Luo Tian? He’d stolen their spotlight, drawing Iron Sect and Di Sect’s attention.
