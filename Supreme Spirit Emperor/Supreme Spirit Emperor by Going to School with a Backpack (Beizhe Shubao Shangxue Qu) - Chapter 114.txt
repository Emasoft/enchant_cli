Within his spiritual awareness, Luo Han's body was struck by the Kai Tian Seal and driven into the ground, blood spilling from his mouth in a most pitiful manner.

Yet Luo Tian could sense that Luo Han still possessed the strength to fight on, posing a certain threat.

"Use Mother's Water Dragon Bow," Luo Tian murmured to himself, retrieving the bow gifted by Zhang Qiu Yue.

The dragon horn-forged bow was cold to the touch, and as soon as Luo Tian touched its frame, he felt a frigid aura seeping into his spirit.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian just retrieved the bow, a sound of earth breaking echoed in people's ears, causing Luo Han's faction to burst into joy.

With Luo Wu defeated and Luo Qingqing victorious, the score was tied one to one. Initially, Luo Han's faction had lost hope, but upon hearing the earth-breaking sound, their despair rekindled.

"Luo Han is invincible!" The young members of Luo Han's faction cried out in unison, eyes alight with excitement.

"Shoo..." Four-colored spiritual energy erupted from the ground like a volcano, and in an instant, a battered figure appeared in the sky, eyes wild as it stared at Luo Tian.

"You... are done! You've truly angered me!" Luo Han shouted, his voice laced with bitter resentment. But before he could finish, he paused, his gaze turning fearful.

Luo Han sensed an icy aura locking onto him, and in front of him stood Luo Tian, holding the Water Dragon Bow with a faint smile.

The bow was drawn to its fullest, and the Rending Sky Spear seemed accustomed to resting on the dragon sinew string, emitting a deep hum.

"You've lost!" Luo Tian's voice echoed like abyssal ice within Luo Han's mind, a sound only Luo Han could hear.

"Such markings on this bow must be crafted by Qiu Yue's daughter, right? Alas, her skill in forging weapons is unparalleled on the Tianyuan Continent. If it possesses a soul essence, it would be a high-grade earth-level artifact! Truly remarkable!" Several elders marveled, gazing at the Water Dragon Bow in Luo Tian's grasp.

"Crack..." A faint tremor echoed, and before long, the Rending Sky Spear remained on the string but its true form materialized before Luo Han.

"Spurt..." Blood splattered from Luo Han's shoulder, and he was propelled backward by the spear without pause.

"Crack..." When Luo Han collided with the barrier, a soft sound followed before he halted.

What people witnessed next would remain unforgettable: their family's Soul Consolidation Stage elder had erected the barrier, a casual arrangement that should have withstood an attack from a Soul Sacrifice Stage powerhouse.

Yet the Rending Sky Spear had pierced through the barrier, even splitting it slightly. Luo Han's body was pinned to the barrier, his face contorted with terror.

In an instant, Luo Tian appeared before Luo Han, gently grasping the Rending Sky Spear and pulling it free.

Luo Han's face was pale, his gaze vacant, forgetting he still hovered high above as he slid down the barrier, leaving a trail of blood upon it.

Apologies to everyone; this update was delayed. I went out with friends yesterday and only returned today. These past few days were written in a rush, possibly riddled with typos—please bear with me.

Chapter 558: Can You Lose?

Chapter 558: Can You Lose?

People gazed at the bloodstains on the barrier, their faces ashen. Seeing Luo Han's shoulder wound—bloody and gaping—they were stunned.

Their eyes then turned to Luo Tian, standing like a sovereign in the sky, and they couldn't help but express awe.

Today, Luo Tian had shattered their mythic image, defeating it utterly. If that shot had struck his heart, they dared not imagine further.

"Defeated!" Young members of Luo Han's faction wore expressions of disbelief, some even shedding tears.

"How could I lose?" Luo Han felt no pain from his shoulder wound, his face as pale as paper, whispering to himself.

"I am Luo Han; I will not lose!" Luo Han roared, attempting to rise but his body was ravaged by a terrifying force, then frozen by an icy aura.

"I told you—nothing is absolute, and no one is invincible!" Luo Tian stood before Luo Han, the Rending Sky Spear pointing at him, its tip dripping with Luo Han's blood.

"As per the prior agreement, the Luo Zhan faction has won!" An elder declared, his face filled with approval as he gazed at Luo Tian.

No one dared challenge the elder's words, their gazes filled with respect as they looked toward the elders seated on the platform.

"Victory!" Luo Zhen and Luo Wu, among other young men, cried out tearfully toward the sky. The Luo Zhan faction outside the barrier did the same.

A century of humiliation had pushed the Luo Zhan faction to their limits, enduring years of shame on Ice Ocean Island. At times, they were even treated worse than servants.

Over the years, many family members had been expelled from Ice Ocean Island, fueling resentment toward Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian, even more so toward Luo Tian.

But today, with Luo Tian's return and his victories in two battles alone, the Luo family had reclaimed their direct lineage. The resentment toward Luo Tian and his grandparents vanished, replaced by a subtle reverence.

"Boom..." As people marveled, the battlefield at the Soul Sacrifice Stage finally concluded with a long laugh echoing in their ears, shaking them.

"Haha! Luo Zhan, I admit your strength is formidable—so much so that even Luo Hu couldn't match you. But compared to me, you're still lacking. As long as our faction remains, unless Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian return, your lineage will forever be crushed beneath us!" Luo Tai laughed as he and other clan leaders appeared before them.

Luo Zhan emerged pale-faced, his gaze filled with deep self-reproach as he looked at his faction.

But when Luo Zhan saw the joy on his clan's faces, a strange feeling stirred within him.

During the match, Luo Zhan's strength had stunned everyone, but compared to Luo Tai, it was still lacking. Even with a secret technique, he hadn't defeated Luo Tai.

The clan leaders then noticed the bloodstains on the barrier, their gazes flickering in surprise.

Following the direction of the bloodstains, they saw Luo Han—his shoulder wound already hardened—and several young men from Luo Tai's faction. Their gazes darkened.

Luo Tai spotted the hardened wound on Luo Han's shoulder, his gaze stunned before he instantly appeared beside him.

"Han'er, what happened? Why are you so severely wounded? Is Luo Tian a formidable opponent?" Luo Tai's gaze was grave. Seeing Luo Tian unscathed, only slightly battered, he felt an ominous premonition.

"I lost!" Luo Han's eyes were lifeless, as if answering Luo Tai or merely murmuring to himself.

But before Luo Han's words finished, the clan leaders' faces changed drastically. They knew Luo Han's strength well—among the younger generation in the southern domain, he was top ten. Yet now, he had lost to Luo Tian.

"Indeed, the son of Luo Nantian!" The clan leaders sighed inwardly, their gazes toward Luo Tian shifting.

"Loss is loss; it was just an individual match. You can win back later. At least, we won the team battle. I also won my Soul Sacrifice Stage match. We are still direct lineage. With such resources, I don't believe you'll be any worse than others!" Luo Tai patted Luo Han's shoulder, offering comfort.

When Luo Zhan heard of Luo Han's defeat, his heart jolted. Yet he looked at Luo Tian with relief. With their two victories, they were no longer the lowest among the factions, nor would they be expelled from Ice Ocean Island.

As for Luo Zhan's faction winning the team battle, including Luo Zhan himself, they found it impossible. In past years, no clan had ever won the direct lineage team battle.

"Clan Leader, we also lost the team battle!" Young men from Luo Tai's faction cried out, almost sobbing their words.

"Boom..." As the young man spoke, it sent a tidal wave through the clan leaders' minds, their eyes widening.

"What!" Luo Tai roared, instantly appearing before the speaking young man, seizing him by the collar. His gaze held disbelief.

"I... we lost..." The young man, seeing Luo Tai's eyes nearly bleeding with anger, trembled as he spoke.

"Boom..." As the young man's words ended, Luo Tai's face paled, and the temperature of the entire world seemed to drop.

"What exactly happened!" Luo Tai's voice was calm, but everyone could sense the coldness in his eyes.

Under Luo Tai's furious gaze, the young man seized by him recounted the entire incident.

After hearing the young man's account, Luo Tai seemed to age decades, his gaze filled with anger as he turned toward Luo Han.

"Han'er, you've truly disappointed me. Such an important matter—why did you act so recklessly? Even if it was reckless, what's the harm in losing once? A century ago, we became direct lineage; a century later, I'll reclaim it. We can afford to lose!" Luo Tai's voice thundered in people's ears.

Chapter 559: The Grand Competition Ends

Chapter 559: The Grand Competition Ends

Luo Tai's words were not conveyed through spiritual awareness but carried endless pride, his gaze fixed on Luo Zhan and Luo Tian.

Hearing Luo Tai's words, Luo Tian secretly marveled at how ruthless this Luo Tai was. Just with those words alone, their faction would surely solidify its position on Ice Ocean Island. Luo Tian noticed that the elders had subtly nodded after hearing Luo Tai's words.

Luo Tai's faction members, upon hearing his words, felt the oppressive atmosphere ease somewhat, their gazes filled with anticipation toward Luo Han and Luo Tai.

Even Luo Han's lifeless eyes gradually focused, then burst with intense light as he gazed at Luo Tian. A towering aura radiated from him, making people feel like a different person.

"One hundred years later, I'll defeat you myself and reclaim my glory!" Luo Han's gaze was resolute as he stared at Luo Tian.

Hearing Luo Han's words, Luo Tian smiled gently, his gaze filled with admiration as he replied aloud: "Good. I'll wait for you; I'll give it my all then!"

"Next match!" An elder spoke, and the scene changed again. Luo Tian led Luo Qingqing and others to face the remaining battles.

With Luo Tian's addition, Luo Qingqing's group was invigorated, their morale soaring. They finally defeated the last two teams, becoming the undeniable first place.

In people's eyes, the final two matches were irrelevant; everyone had already awarded the first place to Luo Tian's faction.

"The winner of this grand competition is the Luo Zhan faction. From today, the Luo Zhan faction becomes direct lineage on Ice Ocean Island. The remaining nine factions will assist the Luo Zhan faction for a hundred years. A hundred years later, another family grand competition will be held," the elder announced the result.

Hearing the final outcome, Luo Zhan and his group wore expressions of excitement, especially Luo Zhan, whose gaze toward Luo Tian carried gratitude and exhilaration.

"Haha... Indeed, the son of Luo Nantian!"

Deep within Ice Ocean Island, Luo Nantian's face lit up with excitement as he laughed.

"Ugh, you're such a shameless one! It's because your son is outstanding!" Zhang Qiu Yue scolded but her eyes held pride.

"Enough, bring this kid over. I should meet him!" Zhang Daotian smiled and spoke to the joyous couple.

Hearing Zhang Daotian's words, Luo Nantian and his wife wore expressions of excitement, nodding gently.

After speaking, the three of them moved their hands slightly, seemingly ordinary but sending out powerful fluctuations.

"Buzz..." A golden dragon emerged from their combined efforts, soaring into the sky.

The golden dragon roared, instantly plunging into the void, leaving a black, hundred-zhang-long rift in the sky, like a passage.

At that moment, Luo Tian was smiling, lifted by people and thrown into the sky. But in an instant, a strong displacement force appeared on Luo Tian's body.

Luo Tian vanished from people's sight, even the elders preparing to leave the platform were caught off guard.

After Luo Tian disappeared, the elders turned their gazes to where he vanished, their expressions solemn.

"Who! Daring to abduct my Ice Ocean Island's junior, thinking I am what place!" One elder with white hair roared into the void, his voice shaking.

Then, several elders launched attacks, piercing the place where Luo Tian vanished, revealing a black void.

The elder's voice also echoed into Luo Nantian and the others' ears.

"Uncle need not be anxious. I am Luo Nantian, long absent from my son. I wish to reunite with Tian for a while. It will be no more than two or three days, at most seven. Tian will return to the sect himself," Luo Nantian called out into the void.

"Ah, Luo Nantian!" Hearing Luo Nantian's words, the elders' tense feelings eased.

Since it was Luo Nantian speaking, they naturally gave him face. They no longer dared underestimate Luo Nantian, even considering him an equal. Moreover, a father meeting his son was natural; there was no need to block it.

"Ah, Luo Nantian!" Other people's faces changed slightly upon hearing Luo Nantian's words.

Luo Zhan was overjoyed, never expecting Luo Nantian to have such power. Even being able to displace was a technique of Soul Consolidation Stage, and Ice Ocean Island's depths were far from here. It revealed Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue's formidable cultivation.

Luo Xiong and others' faces changed drastically. They had thought Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue were missing, even dead.

When they entered the depths of Ice Ocean Island, Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue had only reached the peak of spiritual essence. Such cultivation entering the island's depths was tantamount to suicide.

But today, Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue had appeared, their strength even more formidable. They were now the greatest support for the newly restored direct lineage of Luo Zhan's faction.

"Zhan, congratulations on becoming direct lineage. If you have any commands, just say it; I'll do my best!" A clan leader spoke, smiling at Luo Zhan.

"Yes, Zhan, if you have anything to ask for, I'll also be ready!" With one clan leader's opening, others smiled at Luo Zhan and affirmed their resolve.

Luo Zhan naturally knew these old men were eager to please Luo Nantian's strength, but their faction was still weak and needed these people's help.

"Thank you; thank all of you for your future assistance!" Luo Zhan smiled, forgetting their cold attitude when they were in despair. He responded to each one.

Luo Tian was unaware of these matters, but when displacement force formed on his body, he sighed inwardly, unsure who had displaced him. He felt some trepidation.

"Buzz..." A familiar fluctuation echoed, and Luo Tian's figure appeared before Luo Nantian, Zhang Qiu Yue, and Zhang Daotian.

Cold—Luo Tian's first feeling upon landing was coldness, a bone-chilling chill that even froze his spiritual energy. He felt the same sensation as when he entered the array set by those three old men in Xuanbing City.

Chapter 560: Ancient Ice Dragon Soul

Chapter 560: Ancient Ice Dragon Soul

The cold wind made Luo Tian shiver instinctively. Snowflakes drifted down, landing on his shoulders. Even more shocking was that each snowflake's fall caused Luo Tian to startle, as if his body would freeze without the presence of the碧晶琉璃火 (Bijin Lilu Fire).

"Son!" As Luo Tian marveled, a loud voice echoed in his ears. Three figures appeared before him, causing Luo Tian's body to tremble and his gaze to turn joyous.

"Respectful greetings, father, mother, master!" Luo Tian knelt on the icy ground.

"Rise! This is where my wife and I guard the seal," Luo Nantian said, his white robe as snow, eyes filled with satisfaction.

Zhang Qiu Yue quickly approached Luo Tian, grabbing his left and right to inspect him, her eyes filled with reproach: "Son, why are you so thin? Did you not eat well outside?"

"Uh..." Luo Tian and Luo Nantian were momentarily stunned, even Zhang Daotian was amused by Zhang Qiu Yue's words.

Luo Tian was now a spiritual essence stage powerhouse, long past needing food. How could he be thin?

"Good!" Zhang Daotian smiled, gazing at Luo Tian with satisfaction.

"Master, you've finally appeared!" Luo Tian looked at Zhang Daotian, his face filled with respect as he bowed.

"It's not yet the time to appear! I'm still just a spiritual body. This visit to Ice Ocean Island was coincidental, and I came to see you!" Zhang Daotian spoke. Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue stood respectfully beside Zhang Daotian.

"We moved you here to see you and also to enhance your strength. Additionally, your parents should go out for a while; they've been stuck in this cold place too long!" Zhang Daotian smiled, addressing Luo Tian and the three others.

Hearing Zhang Daotian's words, Luo Tian and the others trembled, their gazes turning to Zhang Daotian. Especially Luo Tian, his face filled with joy.

Luo Tian's greatest inner conflict was the death of Chen Yunting for him, and his second biggest was that his parents had come to this cold place to guard for countless years. Also, Grandfather Luo Xiong's whereabouts were unknown.

"What should I do?" Luo Tian bowed, gazing at Zhang Daotian before looking at the vast spatial rift behind them. He could sense a heart-stirring aura emanating from within it.

"Don't be nervous. With my and your parents' combined strength, we can handle the entity within this rift. However, that entity is key to your strength improvement!" Zhang Daotian explained carefully to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian was shocked and filled with admiration, gazing at Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue.

Indeed, Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue had been guarding an ice dragon in the depths of Ice Ocean Island. Now, the dragon was sealed and its strength had weakened, descending from Soul Consolidation Peak to Soul Consolidation Initial.

Yet this ice dragon was audacious, having sacrificed its physical body to leave only its soul and heart. Its strength had recovered to Soul Consolidation Mid, nearly escaping the seal when Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue were careless.

"Rending Sky Spear!" Zhang Daotian murmured, and the spear flew from Luo Tian's storage bag into his hand.

"Good spear, but it lacks a soul essence. Today, my three of us will erase the ice dragon's soul within and forge it for your Rending Sky Spear. Then, let your mother refine it to see if it can reach the Heaven Stage!" Zhang Daotian spoke, returning the spear to Luo Tian.

"Heaven Stage!" Hearing Zhang Daotian's words, Luo Tian's face changed drastically, his gaze turning to Zhang Daotian and the others. Especially when he saw his mother, his face was filled with disbelief.

Feeling his son's reverent gaze, Zhang Qiu Yue smiled: "Don't look at me so worshipfully. I'm not sure if it can reach the Heaven Stage, but I'm confident it can reach a step toward it!"

"A step toward Heaven Stage is already good!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, acknowledging that it was far better than the Earth Stage Initial. Moreover, Heaven Stage treasures were rare; Luo Tian had never seen one before!

"As for the ice dragon's heart, it's prepared for you. This dragon's essence has all gathered within this heart. If you refine it, you might even reach the Soul Sacrifice Stage. With so many methods at your disposal, you'll have a significant advantage when traveling outside or in the ancient relics of Xian Gu." Zhang Daotian spoke, and Luo Tian and Luo Nantian listened quietly.

Although Zhang Daotian was currently just a spiritual body, he had reached the Soul Sacrifice Peak. Luo Tian was no longer the small cultivation stage boy who first met Zhang Daotian. Now, he knew that a spiritual body reaching the Soul Sacrifice Peak meant his master's true strength was beyond comprehension. Luo Tian even suspected whether his master had reached the legendary界尊境 (Jiezun Stage).

"Enough talk. Wait for refinement; your current strength can't yet confront Soul Consolidation Stage battles. One misstep, and you'll be reduced to ashes!" Zhang Daotian spoke, his hand glowing green as he pointed at Luo Tian's waist's养魂玉 (Yanghun Jade).

"Buzz..." As Zhang Daotian did so, the entire world seemed filled with vitality. The spiritual energy of Ice Ocean Island's sky was instantly drawn into Luo Tian's Yanghun Jade.

Luo Tian felt his surroundings no longer so cold, even sensing a spring-like feeling.

Then, the Yanghun Jade glowed green, and another Zhang Daotian figure gradually formed.

"Two spiritual bodies; their strength should reach Soul Consolidation Mid!" Two Zhang Daotians sighed, slowly approaching each other and merging.

Luo Tian was stunned by this sight, inwardly sighing—two spiritual bodies equaled Soul Consolidation Mid.

Luo Tian knew that at the Soul Consolidation Stage, one could cultivate three souls and freely split into three spiritual bodies. Now, Zhang Daotian's two spiritual bodies merged to reach Soul Consolidation Mid; thus, his master's strength was beyond comprehension.

"Absolutely the Jiezun Stage—no mistake!" Luo Tian felt reverence and pride, for having such a powerful master was a joyous thing.

Chapter 561: Excavating Xuan Ice Essence

Chapter 561: Excavating Xuan Ice Essence

"Alright, we can enter! Tian, wait outside and be ready to respond when we call!" Zhang Daotian spoke, nodding at Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue.

Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue had long prepared, having guarded this place for years. Now able to leave, they were excited.

Swords hung in the air, held by their hands, gazing into the void rift with cold determination.

"Go!" Zhang Daotian spoke, stepping into the void rift. Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiu Yue followed closely, their bodies radiating intense fluctuations.

As they entered, Luo Tian heard a series of thunderous sounds in his ears, and cries echoed.

"Humans! You don't dare to disturb my cultivation! If I catch you..." "Ahh!" The voice was cut off by a more agonizing scream.

Curious, Luo Tian cautiously probed his spiritual awareness into the void rift. He was stunned.

Within the rift, everything was gray. Luo Tian sensed a strong spiritual aura filling the space. He guessed these were spirits killed by Zhang Daotian's group.

The deeper he probed, the denser his spiritual energy became, and the environment gradually changed. The temperature dropped further, and the space was slowly wrapped in ice crystals, emitting a cold glow.

"Boom..." After a thunderous sound, Luo Tian found his spiritual awareness could not extend further. He felt an overwhelming aura that made him feel like a mere ant, his very presence enough to be annihilated.

"Indeed, Soul Consolidation Stage power is terrifying—far stronger than the Soul Sacrifice Stage!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, yet his desire for strength grew.

With nothing else to do, he didn't know when his parents and master would finish their battle. His spiritual awareness spread outward; after all, he remembered why he had come to Ice Ocean Island.

Though the Chronological Scripture mentioned a thousand-zhang ice mountain, Luo Tian, following his principle of higher being better, set his goal on a ten-thousand-zhang ice mountain within his spiritual awareness. He moved swiftly, but due to the temperature, his speed was painfully slow.

After about half an hour, Luo Tian finally reached the base of a ten-thousand-zhang ice mountain. His gaze was filled with admiration as he looked at it, a wry smile on his face. How could he break through this mountain to extract the Xuan Ice Essence beneath it?

"Alas..." Luo Tian sighed, a wry smile on his face. He took out the Rending Sky Spear and plunged it downward into the ice mountain.

"Crack..." A sharp sound echoed, and the spear tip pierced through the ice surface, sending countless ice shards flying onto Luo Tian's face.

"Only this much?" Luo Tian was stunned, staring at the ice surface pierced just half a meter. He sighed loudly.

He even considered waiting for his parents and master to help, but then shook his head. He sent out a streak of green fire.

The碧晶琉璃火 (Bijin Lilu Fire) dimmed instantly, for even though it was a rare fire of the world, in this icy realm, it dared not act recklessly. A regular fire would be instantly extinguished by such an environment.

"Hiss..." Luo Tian instinctively blew the fire onto the ice, then resumed digging with the Rending Sky Spear.

With the addition of the Bijin Lilu Fire and his powerful body, Luo Tian's digging speed improved significantly. The Rending Sky Spear became a blur before him, and ice shards swirled around.

"Ten zhang... one hundred zhang... a thousand zhang..." After about half an hour, Luo Tian reached a thousand-zhang depth and found a crystalline object emitting coldness beneath the ice mountain.

"Found it!" Luo Tian's face lit up, grabbing it.

"Sss..." Upon grasping the Xuan Ice Essence, Luo Tian inhaled sharply.

As soon as he held it, he felt no coldness at all, leaving him bewildered.

But then, a cold aura formed into a white dragon and slithered into his body, rapidly circulating through his meridians. The coldness froze his meridians almost instantly.

Luo Tian was stunned, but the Bijin Lilu Fire flew from his dantian to dispel the coldness. He sighed in relief.

"Thankfully, I have the Bijin Lilu Fire; otherwise, it would've been a problem!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He then pressed seals onto the palm-sized Xuan Ice Essence, sealing it in a large jade box.

"Alas... I wonder how the Grand Elder is doing!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, then followed the excavated ice passage back to the surface.

"One is not safe; I should get more!" He muttered, his spiritual awareness drifting outward to find another target.

Soon, Luo Tian found another ten-thousand-zhang ice mountain and took a step forward toward it.

He skillfully retrieved the Rending Sky Spear, ignited the Bijin Lilu Fire, and was about to start excavating when the spear trembled violently. Even Luo Tian couldn't control it, and it flew from his hand as a dark light toward the distance.

"Kid, come back! We've finished here!" Zhang Daotian's voice echoed, and then Luo Tian felt displacement force again, vanishing before the ten-thousand-zhang ice mountain.

"Alas..." Luo Tian sighed, and in an instant, he appeared before Zhang Daotian and Luo Nantian's group.

Instinctively observing his surroundings, he was stunned; the area was filled with intense light, making him dizzy. He felt as if he were in an ice palace.

A chair resembling crystal stood at the top of the palace, and a blue heart-shaped object floated above it, pulsating gently.

"This is the ice dragon's heart; go refine it!" Zhang Daotian spoke kindly, reaching out to send the heart toward Luo Tian.

Meanwhile, Zhang Qiu Yue also held the Rending Sky Spear in her hand, a pale fire emerging from it.

Chapter 562: Rending Sky Spear's Upgrade

Chapter 562: Rending Sky Spear's Upgrade

Seeing Zhang Qiu Yue ignite the white fire, Luo Tian's face turned serious. Such a temperature could still maintain such an intense flame—its temperature had even slightly decreased. Luo Tian knew his mother's white fire was no ordinary thing, at least not inferior to the Bijin Lilu Fire.

"Roar..." Ignoring Luo Tian's amazement, Zhang Qiu Yue's face turned serious. She reached into the void and pulled out a gray aura, which roared like a dragon and struggled.

"Little eel! You've made us suffer here for years; today, I'll finish you!" Zhang Qiu Yue sneered and tossed the gray aura into the white fire refining the Rending Sky Spear.

"Kid, don't stare; go refine that heart and stop standing there!" Luo Nantian patted Luo Tian's shoulder, scolding him.

After being patted, Luo Tian snapped back to reality and grabbed the floating ice dragon heart in front of him. He sat cross-legged, placing it into his mouth.

"Gulping..." Upon placing the blue gem-like ice dragon heart in his mouth, Luo Tian's face slightly changed. He clearly felt the powerful heartbeat of the ice dragon heart and its coldness instantly freezing him.

"Bijin Lilu Fire!"

"Five Elements Transformation and Cultivation Technique!" Luo Tian growled, activating both the Bijin Lilu Fire and Five Elements Transformation and Cultivation Technique to refine the ice dragon heart he had swallowed into his dantian.

Luo Nantian and Zhang Daotian sat cross-legged before them, guarding them to prevent any mishaps.

The ice dragon heart was powerful but lacked offensive capabilities. Under the combined refinement of the Bijin Lilu Fire and Five Elements Transformation and Cultivation Technique, in Luo Tian's anticipation, a drop of red blood slowly flowed from the ice dragon heart.

"Roar..." At this moment, Luo Tian knew it was the blood of the ice dragon king, containing powerful cultivation.

Luo Nantian and Zhang Daotian also opened their eyes simultaneously, gazing at Luo Tian with anticipation. They naturally knew that a drop of ice dragon blood had been refined by Luo Tian.

"Refine!" Luo Tian roared, directing his spiritual awareness to the blood floating in his dantian. The powerful ice dragon blood gradually disappeared under Luo Tian's refinement, flowing into his body as a torrent of cultivation.

"Nothing more; just wait for this kid to break through!" Luo Nantian spoke softly, smiling at Zhang Daotian.

"Buzz..." As the two smiled, a strong tremor erupted from Zhang Qiu Yue's side, causing them to turn their gazes toward her.

Zhang Daotian waved his hand, forming a green barrier between Luo Tian and Zhang Qiu Yue. It separated them to prevent mutual interference.
