However, before Luo Tian could ponder further, he felt a wave of pain in his physical body within the icy Ming River. The sensation grew stronger, as if countless tormented souls were tearing at him.

“This! Is the greatest boon of the Rebirth Bridge—the Ming River refining the body!” Though in pain, Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with sharp determination. He could feel his physical body gradually strengthening as the tormented souls bit into him.

“Is this child acquainted with that soul?” Outside, Sichuan Chen, who had been watching Zhang Daotian closely, furrowed his brow in confusion. He sensed that Luo Tian could continue walking forward, reaching the five hundred thousand feet mark he had once achieved.

Yet Luo Tian chose to perform his final soul-body fusion, using the bronze cauldron to retrieve his soul. Clearly, he intended to take that soul with him, even at the cost of forgoing an opportunity to strengthen it.

The other elders also felt puzzled, unsure why Zhang Daotian had acted this way. They were certain he had never before entered the Rebirth Bridge, and they had raised him since childhood. Now, even they found it difficult to fathom Zhang Daotian's actions.

“Failure!” The crowd saw Luo Tian’s light dim slightly, their faces falling with disappointment. They had hoped Zhang Daotian would once again astonish them, surpassing Sichuan Chen’s record. Yet he had only managed four hundred thousand feet.

“Four hundred thousand feet is no small feat! It’s the best result of this Rebirth Bridge’s opening!” The disciples of the Tian Dao Sect wore expressions of envy. While four hundred thousand feet seemed trivial to the elders, it was an insurmountable chasm for these disciples.

“Ugh…” Yet Luo Tian now howled in the river’s waters, his pain intensifying over time. It felt as if millions of ants gnawed at him, and the river’s pull grew stronger. He had to divert his focus to resist this overwhelming force.

Though enduring the agony, Luo Tian felt his physical body gradually strengthening, his eyes alight with excitement.

Ten breaths passed in the blink of an eye. Though brief, those ten breaths felt like an entire cycle to Luo Tian.

Within that time, his physical body advanced from the initial stage of Ritual Soul to its intermediate phase. Luo Tian marveled at the Ming River’s terrifying power but could not bear to leave it behind.

“Tian Dao, why hasn’t he emerged yet!” Ren Hongzhi and others exclaimed in disbelief, staring at the faintly glowing light on the screen.

All disciples of Tian Dao Sect who had entered the Rebirth Bridge also wore expressions of shock, gazing at the screen.

They had all fallen into the river before and knew its body-refining properties. Yet among the three hundred thousand disciples, none had lasted more than three breaths before being expelled. Zhang Daotian now exceeded ten breaths.

Everyone’s gazes carried admiration, watching the screen. Even the elders wore expressions of surprise. Naturally, they knew the Ming River’s refining power, but such pain was unbearable for ordinary people.

In stunned silence, time flowed to twenty breaths. This moment moved the elders, their eyes filled with anticipation for Zhang Daotian’s emergence and the strength of his physical body.

“Could it be soul-body fusion? This kid is only at the peak of Yuan Ling; if his body fused with his soul, it would be absurdly powerful!”

“Not… impossible. I suspect it’s more likely the peak of Ritual Soul or its intermediate stage!” The crowd murmured.

Zheng Xin stood among Ren Hongzhi’s group, a faint smile on his face. He had ascended to the intermediate stage of Ritual Soul and gazed at the dim light on the screen, marveling at how radiant Luo Tian remained wherever he went.

“Ritual Soul’s advanced stage!” Luo Tian internally assessed his body, elated yet drenched in sweat. However, within the river’s gray depths, no traces of sweat were visible.

“Ah…” Luo Tian felt unbearable agony now, the pain seeping into his bones. Yet he persisted.

“This boon is rare in a century. If I abandon it, perhaps I’ll never find another. I wonder what’s happening on the Tianyuan Continent now… a strange premonition tugs at me. It feels as if Wei’s master and the elder brother are hiding something from us!”

“If I emerge and face an emergency, my current strength might help but not significantly. Thus, I must grow stronger here in this ancient relic’s domain!” Luo Tian roared, opening his mouth to let the gray Ming River water flood into his body.

“This kid is reckless!” The elders, though unable to hear Luo Tian’s words, could see his actions through their connection with the Rebirth Bridge.

Chapter 622: Ascending to the Ritual Soul Realm

The elders stared in shock as Luo Tian swallowed the gray Ming River water, their faces etched with concern. Since the Rebirth Bridge’s inception, no one had dared do this before.

Sichuan Chen’s expression turned tense. He knew the Ming River’s terrifying biting force. Clenching his fists, he fixed his gaze on Luo Tian, ready to intervene should anything go wrong.

Luo Tian devoured the Ming River water hungrily, his body wracked by agony from within. Yet he maintained a sliver of clarity, floating atop the gray river as if traversing the path of rebirth.

“One breath… two… ten…” Ten breaths passed, and even Sichuan Chen felt the time stretch like a lifetime.

Luo Tian now entered a state of emptiness, a gray aura biting his body from within while refining his sinews and bones.

“Twenty breaths… my god, is he even human?” Ren Hongzhi exclaimed, his eyes wide.

“He’s a monster!” Zheng Xin muttered, as if answering Ren Hongzhi, his expression resolute.

“Hum…” After twenty breaths, Luo Tian could no longer withstand the growing pull of the river. Under the crowd’s stunned gaze, he was expelled from the Rebirth Bridge.

“He’s out!” The crowd gasped as the fading light on the sky emerged.

A slender figure gradually coalesced, appearing before the Tian Dao Sect disciples.

Luo Tian kept his eyes closed, still emitting faint gray mist. He stood motionless under their gaze, yet a terrifying aura radiated from him.

“Ritual Soul peak! His soul is also at the peak!” The nine elders’ eyes gleamed like nine suns, standing on their respective peaks with intense joy.

“With Tian Dao’s presence, the Tian Dao Sect will surely stand unshaken for millions of years!” Mu Rongcheng smiled, his eyes alight with excitement.

For centuries, the Tian Dao Sect had struggled with succession, but Zhang Daotian’s emergence now solved this issue and eased the elders’ long-standing worry.

Luo Tian stood motionless on the Tian Dao Sect’s plaza, his gray mist gradually dissipating into the air.

“Boom… boom…” Thunderous roars echoed in people’s ears, dark clouds gathering above Tian Dao Mountain. Black thunderclouds obscured the sunlight.

“Is he about to ascend to Ritual Soul?” The Tian Dao Sect disciples quickly flew outward, their gazes filled with awe as they stared at the black thunderclouds.

The pressure instantly invaded their minds, filling them with fear.

“Master Zhang Daotian is enduring what kind of thunderstorm? I feel this terrifying pressure, and we could never withstand it!” The disciples murmured, their eyes filled with fear as they gazed at the black thunderclouds.

The clouds thickened, casting the Tian Dao Sect into gloom.

“This kid’s thunderstorm seems abnormal,” the nine elders mused, gazing at the gathering thunderclouds and sighing.

They didn’t know Luo Tian had previously failed to ascend to Ritual Soul. If they had known, the sight of this terrifying pressure and thunderclouds wouldn’t have shocked them so much.

They all knew that failing to ascend to Ritual Soul once made it ten times harder to do so again.

“Boom… boom…” Golden lightning crackled within the clouds, gathering strength. The disciples anxiously watched Luo Tian, still with his eyes closed, their faces etched with worry.

“Crack…” A bolt of lightning fell from the sky, striking Luo Tian. At the same time, his eyes snapped open, gleaming with fierce light as he faced the thunderstorm.

“Go away…” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed, as if embodying heaven’s will, striking the golden lightning.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian spoke, the golden lightning lost its will and struck the stone ground before him. The reinforced stone slab was shattered, turning to dust in the air.

“Boom… boom…” As if sensing Luo Tian’s provocation, thunder rumbled again.

“Crack…” Golden lightning descended once more, but the crowd gasped in disbelief.

“Ten… fifty… a hundred…” A total of a hundred lightning bolts, as thick as water buckets, formed a golden net, covering ten thousand feet around Luo Tian and striking him.

“Thunderstorms are useless against me!” Luo Tian sneered, not dodging. His long robe fluttered without wind, standing proudly.

The net of a hundred lightning bolts descended upon Luo Tian, filling the sky with gold. The area around him became a golden sea.

Destructive and overwhelming, the disciples of Tian Dao Sect were stunned, their eyes fixed on Luo Tian, who stood calmly and let the lightning strike him.

Luo Tian remained there, his face calm as lightning struck him one by one.

Within ten thousand feet around him, the area was filled with lightning. The Tian Dao Sect’s ground was carved several feet deep under the golden thunderstorm, stones flying into the air.

Luo Tian stood there calmly, like a war god, bathed in the golden thunderstorm. Not even his robe’s hem was torn.

“Powerful! Tian Dao’s physical body is terrifying! Just with this, even a mid-level Ritual Soul technique would be powerless against him!” The disciples marveled, gazing at Luo Tian.

As the dust settled, Luo Tian still stood proudly, his gaze filled with provocation as he looked up at the sky.

“Disperse!” His playful voice echoed, low yet resonating across Tian Dao Sect’s mountain peak.

“His soul has reached the peak of Yuan Ling!” The disciples gasped again, their eyes wide with disbelief.

Soul advancement was far more challenging than cultivation or physical body growth, which is why the disciples had been thrilled to learn of the Rebirth Bridge’s opening.

“Boom… boom…” As if sensing Luo Tian’s provocation, the sky grew even more oppressive. Thunder rumbled, as if preparing a fatal strike.

Chapter 623: Thunderstorm Refines the Soul

Luo Tian saw the thunderclouds hadn’t dispersed but grew heavier. A smile tugged at his lips as he murmured, “Not dispersing? What can you do?”

“Still, this thunderstorm shouldn’t be wasted. Now, the refinement of my physical body by the lightning is minimal; even Purple Yuan Thunder would have little effect!” Luo Tian’s face bore contemplation, a bold idea forming in his mind.

“Golden Soul! Appear!” Luo Tian roared, moving his hands as his golden-element Yuan Soul materialized before him.

The crowd’s faces showed confusion, unsure what Luo Tian intended. Even the nine elders were taken aback by his actions.

“Wooden Soul! Appear!” Luo Tian ignored their expressions and summoned the wooden soul again.

“Water Soul! Fire Soul! Appear!” Luo Tian barked, and the four-element Yuan Souls took his form, standing before him.

“Regretfully, the remaining three souls are suppressed and cannot be summoned!” Luo Tian’s face showed disappointment as he gazed at the descending thunderclouds.

“Boom… boom…” A deep sound echoed, as if sensing Luo Tian had summoned four souls. Five black lightning bolts, thick as water buckets, appeared in the crowd’s view.

“Black Demon Thunder!” The nine elders’ eyes widened with surprise, gazing at the black lightning.

The disciples of Tian Dao Sect also gasped, five black bolts slicing through space like tears, striking Luo Tian and the four souls he had summoned.

“I see! This kid wants to refine his Yuan Souls with the thunderstorm! Is he mad?” Some elders wore expressions of disbelief.

“Daotian, give me back your Yuan Souls! Don’t be reckless!” Sichuan Chen’s face showed anxiety, transmitting his voice to Luo Tian.

Yuan Souls merge with the body, making one invincible. However, if injured, it would be irreplaceable damage.

Like before, Luo Tian’s “Burning Soul” method didn’t fully burn the Yuan Soul but left a fragment to self-repair later. This is why he turned into an ordinary person after using it, as one Yuan Soul required seven days to repair.

Now, Luo Tian had dared to summon his Yuan Souls to face the thunderstorm—especially the terrifying Black Demon Thunder. In this case, Sichuan Chen couldn’t be sure if Zhang Daotian could endure it.

Failure would mean irreplaceable damage, with light loss of cultivation or even turning into a fool. Unless he reached the界尊 (Boundary Lord) realm, fully understanding chaos power, or had legendary nine-star reversal pills, there was no other way to recover.

Sichuan Chen couldn’t let his precious disciple take such a risk, his voice filled with anxiety as he transmitted to Luo Tian. If not for the thunderstorm, he would have rushed to Luo Tian’s side and slapped him.

The other elders also wore anxious expressions; the Tian Dao Sect had just found Zhang Daotian, and they couldn’t let him suffer any harm.

In short, Zhang Daotian was now a treasure to the nine elders. Anyone who harmed him would face their wrath and fight to the death.

“Child, don’t be reckless. There are many ways to become stronger; you don’t need such extremes!”

“Daotian, quickly retrieve your Yuan Souls! Don’t be foolish!” The elders’ faces showed anxiety as they transmitted their voices.

“Ugh…” Luo Tian’s face was momentarily shocked, surprised the elders were so tense. Yet soon, his expression changed.

Sichuan Chen and Mu Rongcheng were of what status? The nine elders of Tian Dao Sect, powerful figures who could shake the仙古大陆 (Xian Gu Continent) with a single move. Their anxiety meant Luo Tian’s actions would surely have dire consequences—or if he had any mishap, they couldn’t heal him.

“Can’t take this risk anymore!” Luo Tian whispered, sighing at his own carelessness and intending to retrieve the Yuan Souls.

But he was too late; in a flash, Black Demon Thunder struck Luo Tian and the four Yuan Souls.

“Too late!” The nine elders wore a bitter expression, watching Black Demon Thunder strike Luo Tian and the four Yuan Souls.

Luo Tian’s lips twitched as Black Demon Thunder struck his body, directly affecting his powerful soul and causing him pain.

Though Black Demon Thunder was strong, Luo Tian’s current soul had vastly improved. Though slightly damaged, it wasn’t severe.

The real pain came from the four Yuan Souls struck by Black Demon Thunder—those were fatal injuries.

“Ah…” Luo Tian clutched his head, pale and rolling on the ground, writhing in agony.

Yuan Souls were essentially similar to souls; under Black Demon Thunder, the four-element-formed illusions of Luo Tian dimmed significantly. Their faces also showed pain, and they would surely vanish within a few breaths.

“Done! Done! What now!” The elders wore anxious expressions, watching Luo Tian roll on the ground and sighing.

“There’s no way but to rely on himself!” Sichuan Chen whispered, years of tension he hadn’t felt before now stirred by Luo Tian’s thunderstorm.

“What’s going on!” The disciples of Tian Dao Sect didn’t understand, their faces puzzled as they watched Luo Tian roll on the ground.

“Ha! Foolishness, truly foolish!” A black-cloaked figure stood among the disciples, his eyes cold as he gazed at Luo Tian with mockery.

“Everything will be fine! He’s Luo Tian; he’s no ordinary person!” Zheng Xin silently prayed, his face drenched in cold sweat. He had no way to help Luo Tian now but could only pray for him.

“One breath… two… three…” Three breaths passed, and Luo Tian still rolled on the ground, headbutting it repeatedly. The four Yuan Souls had vanished into the world under Black Demon Thunder’s destruction.

“Done… truly done… Yuan Souls destroyed!” The nine elders wore sorrowful expressions, Sichuan Chen’s eyes even moistened.

“Is it over?” The disciples of Tian Dao Sect felt doubt.

“It’s not over! If it were, why is Daotian still headbutting the ground!” Someone exclaimed, noticing a detail.

“Hum…” As the nine elders felt despair, a faint fluctuation arose before Luo Tian, so subtle only Sichuan Chen and Mu Rongcheng could sense it.

Chapter 624: Re-Enduring the Mind Demon’s Trial

“This is chaos energy!” Sichuan Chen’s face lit up with joy, sensing the faint fluctuation preserved a fragment of Luo Tian’s Yuan Soul. He knew this energy well—it was the chaos power he had infused into Luo Tian’s body.

“Sichuan truly cherishes this disciple; even chaos power was given!” Mu Rongcheng sighed, gazing at the Dan Sect.

Chaos power—Mu Rongcheng knew it well; he himself had mastered one chaos power. He also understood how precious this fragment was to cultivators, a dream for many to grasp even a hint of chaos power. Yet Zhang Daotian had it effortlessly.

Though this fragment was weak, Mu Rongcheng knew with this chaos power, Zhang Daotian’s future cultivation would accelerate rapidly. With his talent, he had a chance to become a Boundary Lord.

“What’s happening? Daotian’s Yuan Souls have regenerated!” As Mu Rongcheng sighed, the crowd wore surprised expressions, watching Luo Tian lying on the ground, still headbutting it.

“Hum…” As he spoke, four faint fluctuations rose, appearing before the crowd.

In an instant, the four lights erupted with overwhelming waves, piercing into the black clouds above.

The four-color light screen saw Luo Tian’s Yuan Souls regenerating visibly, even more solid than before—almost like his own clone.

Luo Tian, lying on the ground, slightly regained consciousness. Blood flowed from his forehead as he panted heavily, his eyes filled with surprise at the half-formed Yuan Souls.

In that moment, he had thought he was done, but instead, he had survived.

“Chaos power!” Luo Tian whispered, his eyes filled with gratitude toward the Dan Sect. Without Sichuan Chen’s chaos power, he would have been in real danger this time.

“Seems I should avoid boasting from now on,” Luo Tian sighed, gazing at the fully regenerated four Yuan Souls.

Four lifelike figures floated before him, each with different expressions, leaving Luo Tian astonished.

He could feel how powerful the regenerated Yuan Souls were—more than double their previous strength.

“With such Yuan Souls, I can definitely crush a Ritual Soul Intermediate with just entering the Ritual Soul Initial. This is great fortune; who dares to refine Yuan Souls!” Luo Tian’s heart surged with excitement. He inhaled, drawing the four Yuan Souls into his body.

As they entered his body, a thunderous roar erupted, and Luo Tian’s aura returned to its peak.

Seeming to sense Luo Tian’s fearlessness, the sky’s clouds gradually dispersed, revealing golden sunlight. The sun’s warmth touched Luo Tian’s face, giving him a sense of comfort.

“The real test is coming!” Luo Tian finally wore a solemn expression, his eyes filled with anticipation for the Mind Demon’s trial.

“Here it comes—Mind Demon’s Trial!” Sichuan Chen wore a solemn expression, raising his hand to create a green barrier before Luo Tian.

Luo Tian closed his eyes, waiting for the Mind Demon’s trial to arrive.

“Hum…” A faint fluctuation arose before Luo Tian, gently tapping Sichuan Chen’s barrier.

“It has come! The familiar feeling!” Luo Tian internally murmured, as if he had once again crossed the Rebirth Bridge and been reborn in another world.

“Big Brother Tian, from now on, I only have you! You mustn’t get hurt!” A woman’s crying voice awakened Luo Tian.

“Big Brother Tian, you’re awake!” Luo Tian opened his eyes to see a frail woman with joy in her gaze.

“Yunting! I’ve seen you again!” Luo Tian sighed, sitting up from the bed. His body felt like returning to an ordinary person, and his age had reverted to sixteen.

“I’m fine, Yunting. Don’t worry about me; I’ve recovered!” Luo Tian smiled, gently wiping the tears from Chen Yunting’s eyes, his face filled with concern.

“Again… my Mind Demon Trial!” Luo Tian sighed, standing up and walking to a funeral hall. The room’s smoky scent made him uncomfortable, causing him to cough a few times.

“Big Brother Tian, rest. I’ll take care of it!” Chen Yunting appeared before Luo Tian.

“I’m fine, Yunting. Father’s funeral has already been held. Are you really going to Feiyun Sect?” Luo Tian wore a gentle smile, gently brushing Chen Yunting’s disheveled hair.

“Yes, I must go. I want to cultivate into a immortal and avoid experiencing separation again! Big Brother Tian, let’s go together, okay!” Chen Yunting’s eyes showed determination and longing.

“Okay, I’ll accompany you.” Luo Tian smiled, gently hugging Chen Yunting. His face had two lines of tears flowing down.

Luo Tian knew this was all fake, a scene he was too familiar with—the time before he and Chen Yunting had entered Feiyun Sect. Now, the Mind Demon Trial was presenting this scene again, making it impossible for Luo Tian to break this beauty.

After death, one must pass the seven-day mourning period. Luo Tian had previously taken care of Chen Yunting’s seven days, staying up all night without blinking until he fainted.

Now that the seven-day mourning was over, Luo Tian and Chen Yunting prepared slightly—actually just packing a few clothes.

They had no money, and Chen Yunting was frail. During their journey, Luo Tian worked odd jobs to support both of them.

After half a year of wandering, Luo Tian finally brought Chen Yunting to what they considered an immortal sect—Feiyun Sect.

But upon arrival, they learned Feiyun Sect would open its doors for disciples in a year. Their joy was short-lived.

Upon reaching Feiyun Sect’s mountain base, Chen Yunting fell ill from the journey. This illness made their life even more desperate.

Chapter 625: Mind Demon’s End

Luo Tian helplessly watched Chen Yunting lying in bed, his face filled with reluctance. He knew this was fake but couldn’t bear to see the woman fall to illness. After all, he owed her so much in his heart.

Luo Tian had no choice but to work odd jobs again with his thin body.

One, two, three… He found three odd jobs to afford medicine for Chen Yunting and sustain their lives.

Three jobs were his limit, but after over a year, Luo Tian’s body grew thinner while Chen Yunting gradually recovered. This made Luo Tian overjoyed.

A year passed, and Luo Tian had forgotten himself completely, fully immersed in this illusion of the Mind Demon.

“Yunting! I heard Feiyun Sect will start recruiting disciples tomorrow!” Luo Tian’s face lit up with joy, taking out three white steamed buns from his pocket and handing them to Chen Yunting.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Chen Yunting wore a happy expression. She had known for a year what kind of life Luo Tian lived—these buns were always reserved for her, while he ate wild vegetables from the fields.

Seeing the three buns still warm with Luo Tian’s body heat, Chen Yunting couldn’t help but cry. Her voice was choked: “Big Brother Tian, I suddenly don’t want to become immortal anymore. I just want to spend this life with you quietly. That’s enough for me!”

“Stupid girl, a lifetime isn’t enough. I want to spend a thousand years, ten thousand years with you!” Luo Tian gently pulled Chen Yunting into his arms, his gaze soft.

They pushed and shoved each other until they ate two buns. The last one remained untouched, both unwilling to eat it and wanting to save it for the other.

The next morning, Luo Tian led Chen Yunting to Feiyun Sect’s mountain base. They looked like beggars, being looked down upon by others.

But when they were tested for talent, Luo Tian and Chen Yunting caused a stir in Feiyun Sect.

Luo Tian was tested as a five-element body type, and Chen Yunting as a dual-element. This shocked Feiyun Sect.

They naturally entered Feiyun Sect and received great cultivation, their progress rapid.

In the first year, Luo Tian reached the ninth stage of Cultivating Body; in the second, he entered Bone Transformation. In the third, he reached Yuan Ling. In the fourth, he ascended to Ritual Soul.

Four years of rapid progress made Luo Tian renowned across the Tianyuan Continent, elevating Feiyun Sect to a top-tier sect.

Chen Yunting also had extraordinary talent, though slightly behind Luo Tian. She became renowned among sects, and the two of them were like celestial lovers across the Tianyuan Continent.

“Four years!” Luo Tian stood on Feiyun Sect’s mountain peak, gazing into the distance with a deep expression.

“What’s wrong? Big Brother Tian?” Chen Yunting, in flowing robes, stood before Luo Tian with a gentle expression.

“I must leave!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed reluctance, gazing at Chen Yunting.

“Where to? I’ll go with you!” Chen Yunting leaned into Luo Tian’s arms.

Four years had passed, and they had married when reaching Yuan Ling, making others envious.

“I mean I must return to my world, Yunting. I’m sorry; I’ll compensate you in another world!” Luo Tian’s face showed strong reluctance. He knew this was all a dream of his, but he truly couldn’t bear to part.

“Why? Stay here with me! Why must you leave!” Chen Yunting cried, her eyes filled with tears.

“This isn’t our world. Everything here is my imagination—yourself included. Even if I reach the end with you, I’ll disappear from this world!” Luo Tian’s face showed determination. His aura gradually became unstable.

“Stay here! Isn’t that better?” Sensing Luo Tian’s changing aura, Chen Yunting’s face turned fierce, no longer the gentle image.

“Enough! I must leave!” Luo Tian smiled and spoke to Chen Yunting, whose face had become fierce. He knew if he stayed longer, his Mind Demon Trial would fail.

“I won’t let you go! Can you even leave!” Chen Yunting hissed, her appearance changing as black mist seeped from her body.

“Boom…” Finally, under Luo Tian’s gentle gaze, Chen Yunting transformed into a black mist, forming a massive mouth to swallow Luo Tian.

“I told you, you’re just an illusion of mine. Everything here is my inner imagination. I’ve already defeated you once; I won’t let it happen again. Besides, Yunting is by my side now. You can’t harm me at all!”

“I’ve spent four years here to settle my past. Today, I’ll sever the Mind Demon and be reborn!” Luo Tian roared, throwing a punch. The power of Rebirth surged, and the Rebirth Channel’s strong suction pulled in the massive mouth.

“Ah… Luo Tian, you truly have the heart to kill me!” The black mist roared, its voice filled with fear.

“Goodbye!” Luo Tian’s cold gaze watched the black Rebirth Channel pull in the dark figure.

After pulling in the black mist, the suction didn’t stop. The mountains and rivers beneath Luo Tian, Feiyun Sect’s disciples, elders, and masters were all pulled into the Rebirth Channel.

“One punch?” Sichuan Chen wore a puzzled expression, watching Luo Tian standing within the green barrier with his eyes closed. He sighed softly.

The Rebirth Punch struck the green barrier, producing a thunderous roar. Yet people felt strange.

“Is this a Mind Demon Trial?”

“Yes, but why does it seem so simple for him?” The disciples of Tian Dao Sect wore strange expressions, gazing at Luo Tian. They had all endured Mind Demon Trials before and felt the chaos they caused. Now, they found it hard to adjust.

“Back!” Luo Tian gazed at the now-empty world, smiling and sighing. His body vanished from his spot.

At the same time, Sichuan Chen and others saw Luo Tian’s eyes snap open. The sky dimmed under his gaze.

“Ascend to Ritual Soul!” Luo Tian opened his eyes, a smile on his face as he pointed.

Chapter 626: Ascending to the Ritual Soul Realm

One finger, the world trembled. Under Luo Tian’s outstretched hand, all the energy in the world surged toward Tian Dao Sect’s plaza, gathering around him.

Thick energy obscured Luo Tian’s figure, visible only through spiritual senses.

Seven Yuan Souls within his body opened their eyes simultaneously, absorbing the vast energy like a ravenous beast.

“Is this ascending to Ritual Soul?”

“Why does it feel like Daotian’s ascension is much louder than ours!”

“Cut it out. You think you can compare to Daotian, the little ancestor? Daotian is a four-element body type! He nearly defeated Ma Xiujie at Yuan Ling peak!” The disciples of Tian Dao Sect murmured, their gazes filled with awe as they watched Luo Tian.

“Good!” Sichuan Chen only said one word, “good,” and didn’t continue. His old face showed excitement.
