“Yellow Grade Initial Martial Art?” Hu Zhiyong and the others wore expressions of disbelief. They had not expected Luo Tian to employ a Yellow Grade Martial Art to intercept Dong Xingxia, and their faces were filled with disappointment.

Though the Yellow Grade Initial Martial Art wielded by a Bone-Devouring Realm powerhouse could rival that of a Yellow Grade High-Level technique, to the onlookers it was clearly insufficient to halt Dong Xingxia.

“What’s with that!” Gu Qianxue's lips curled. She knew well that Luo Tian had never used his "Blazing Dragon Hand" since he went to avenge himself against the Feiyun Sect. Now that he had used it again, Gu Qianxue was puzzled as to what Luo Tian intended.

“Though I am currently weakened, can a mere Yellow Grade Martial Art stop me?” Dong Xingxia sneered. With a wave of his hand, the Blazing Dragon Hand disintegrated in less than a breath.

Yet none noticed that the scattered Blazing Dragon Hand had transformed into countless embers swirling around Dong Xingxia.

Chapter 338: Blazing Heaven Fire

Chapter 338: Blazing Heaven Fire

“Luo Tian, you truly are arrogant! I'll be leaving now. I remember this grudge!” Dong Xingxia sneered, his figure flickering again as he dashed toward the horizon.

“Can you run? Blazing Heaven Fire Formation!” Luo Tian's lips curled slightly. He let out a low roar, slamming his hands onto the ground.

As Luo Tian's words faded, the embers scattered around Dong Xingxia erupted with a thunderous explosion. Their volume expanded instantly, transforming into fire dragons that spread across the sky.

“Roar…” A series of earth-shaking dragon roars enveloped Dong Xingxia, forming a vast sea of fire under the astonished gazes of onlookers.

It was nearly dusk, and the sky had darkened slightly. Yet below Duanyou Cliff, fire roared into the heavens as if setting the entire cliff ablaze.

“This…” Hu Zhiyong and the others gaped in awe at the Blazing Heaven Fire.

“Is this a martial art?” Hu Zhiyong's face bore disbelief. As a fire-elemental body type, he had profound understanding of fire. The sheer magnitude of this fire sea left him speechless, wondering how much spiritual energy it would take to sustain such power.

Droplets of sweat trickled down the foreheads of the onlookers, their bodies uncomfortably warmed by the intense heat.

Gu Qianxue observed the fire sea and halted her attempt to intercept Dong Xingxia, a faint smile on her face.

“Ah…” Dong Xingxia's cries of anguish echoed from within the fire sea, causing everyone’s hearts to tighten.

“Brother…” Dong Xingjian roared, his face contorted with madness.

At that moment, Dong Xingjian's condition was not good either. Gu Lei possessed the strength of a Bone-Devouring Realm Mid-Stage and his poison techniques were masterful. Dong Xingjian himself was injured, making him no match for Gu Lei. He had been forced into a defensive stance all along; if it weren’t for Gu Lei’s slight restraint, he would have already been a corpse.

“Little brother, so eager to join your brother? Then go keep him company!” Gu Lei laughed, watching Dong Xingjian's distraction. He kicked Dong Xingjian’s abdomen with a powerful foot.

“Huff…” Dong Xingjian's body soared like a ball, curving through the air before plunging into the fire sea.

“Good!” Luo Tian smiled. His cultivation level of the Transcendent Realm, equivalent to an Initial Spirit Soul Stage, controlled the fire dragons within the flames, instantly enveloping Dong Xingjian.

“Damn! That’s an Earth Grade Martial Art!” A youth in the Bone-Devouring Realm Late Stage, witnessing the Blazing Heaven Fire Formation, bore a look of shock. He could sense the terrifying temperature; even if he entered it, he wouldn’t last long.

“Ah… so hot…” Long Bao’bao stuck out her tongue, her face flushed red. She slammed a pink fist into the youth’s chest.

“Pf!” The youth met the same fate as Dong Xingjian, falling into the fire sea.

“Did they all enter?” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly. He controlled the flames to envelop the youth in the Bone-Devouring Realm Late Stage.

“That’s definitely an Earth Grade Martial Art! No wonder he is the strongest prodigy of the Northern Region. Even in the Eastern or Southern Regions, such a person would surely become famous!” Leng Fei mused.

Before long, sixty breaths passed. Luo Tian’s spiritual energy gradually failed to sustain itself; his fire-elemental spiritual energy no longer remained.

The fire sea finally dissipated under the expectant gazes of everyone, leaving Duanyou Cliff’s entire mountain body red-hot and radiating waves of heat.

“Extinct!” Leng Fei murmured softly.

All eyes were filled with anticipation, eager to see if the three men had survived beneath the towering fire sea.

Luo Tian took a deep breath, his eyes alight with joy. He hadn’t expected that his first attempt at an intricate Earth Grade Martial Art would succeed.

His gaze fell upon three dark silhouettes lying on the ground, emitting a strong scent of being charred.

“Dead?” Luo Tian wondered. He could guess that even if they hadn’t died, they wouldn’t be able to threaten him under such an Earth Grade Initial Martial Art. He picked up the Splitting Heaven Spear and strode toward them.

“Boom…” A thunderous sound echoed. A dark figure suddenly stood up, spitting out a mouthful of crimson blood.

“Not dead!” Luo Tian was stunned. He hadn’t expected that even after exhausting all his tricks, he still couldn’t subdue them.

The dark figure’s face was entirely covered in soot, making it impossible to discern any facial features or expressions.

Luo Tian could only see the dark face, its eyes like lightning bolts, filled with endless hatred that etched itself into Luo Tian’s heart.

The dark figure's feet glowed with golden light. At that moment, it dared not fight Luo Tian and vanished like a meteor under the astonished gazes of everyone.

This all happened in an instant, so fast that Luo Tian was still stunned when the figure had already disappeared.

“Hmph…” Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei both let out a cold snort.

Gu Qianxue punched the fleeing dark figure, while Gu Lei also struck with a palm. The two punches and palms landed on the back of the shadow.

“Pf…” The dark figure didn’t even turn around, spitting out blood. Three drops of essence blood transformed into cultivation power, and its speed surged again before vanishing from sight.

“Damn!” Gu Lei clenched his fists, a look of frustration on his face. If it weren’t for the slight distraction earlier, this person would have definitely been caught.

Luo Tian also felt a twinge of regret. He hadn’t expected that even under such a martial art, this person still had the ability to escape.

“Ah… never mind. Unless we also fuse essence blood to chase, we won’t be able to catch them!” Luo Tian shook his head slightly and signaled Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei not to pursue. He turned his gaze toward the other two dark silhouettes.

“Burned so badly, I don’t even know who escaped!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He took the Splitting Heaven Spear and walked toward the two charred figures.

At that moment, they were clearly at their limit. If not treated promptly, death was inevitable.

“Ah… I didn’t want to kill you, but you were just too ungrateful!” Luo Tian sighed.

“Pf…” A dull sound echoed. The Splitting Heaven Spear pierced the chest of the dark figure as if it were tofu.

Lifting the spear’s tip, he showed no hesitation and eliminated the other person. Under the trembling gazes of Hu Zhiyong and others, Luo Tian retrieved his Splitting Heaven Spear and the Sealing Soul Vessel.

“Who were the two dead men? Who escaped?”

“Regardless, Luo Tian has big trouble now!” The group murmured lowly, their faces filled with admiration as they looked at Luo Tian.

“Trouble? Though I fear trouble, if it’s provoked, one cannot avoid it!” Luo Tian's face bore a cold glint. His gaze turned toward the distant mountains, where a mountain faintly appeared in sight. Luo Tian knew that was Kunlun Mountain.

Chapter 339: Kunlun Mountain

Chapter 339: Kunlun Mountain

Seeing Luo Tian kill the two dark silhouettes, everyone felt a pang of sorrow. Their identities were no small matter in the Eastern Region; one of them was certainly a disciple of Tianjian Sect, which held significant influence in the Eastern Region.

“Luo… Luo Tian! What are you planning to do next?” Hu Zhiyong approached Luo Tian, who was collecting the storage bags from the two dark silhouettes.

“Go with the flow. What else can I do? But if they want to trouble me, they must be ready for my retaliation!” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly with a fierce expression.

“Uh…” Hu Zhiyong and the others were speechless at Luo Tian’s words.

“I just hope you don’t leak my whereabouts. As for the rest, I’ll handle it myself. Thank you!” Luo Tian bowed.

“Of course. Killing these two also helped us. If not for them, they would have caused trouble for us at Kunlun Mountain!” Su Yeyu said with a sultry voice.

“Hmph. Well, one escaped. You should still be careful. I guess it was that youth in the Bone-Devouring Realm Late Stage. I can’t imagine how Dong Xingxia and his brother could escape an Earth Grade Martial Art!” Luo Tian spoke softly.

“Hah… ah…” Long Bao’bao’s yawn interrupted their conversation.

“The time has come again!” Luo Tian sighed, patting Long Bao’bao’s head. Golden light flared, and Long Bao’bao vanished. Luo Tian's cultivation level returned to the Ninth Stage of Body Refinement.

Luo Tian felt a sense of foreboding. He hadn’t even entered Kunlun Mountain yet, and he had already activated the Dragon Seal twice. He wondered what misfortunes awaited him inside Kunlun Mountain.

The situation in the Northern Region troubled him. He had been away for several months, and he didn’t know if Tianshi Sect was destroyed after being transported. He also worried about Yang Huanyu’s whereabouts—why hadn’t he shown up if he was in the Eastern Region?

“You all go ahead. After all, the news of Dong Xingxia’s death will spread soon. My identity is bound to be exposed. If you stay with me, it’ll surely raise suspicion.” Luo Tian thought for a moment before speaking softly to Hu Zhiyong and the others.

“Good!” Hu Zhiyong thought for a moment before nodding slightly.

Ding Xiaoyan’s face bore a complex expression as she gazed at the two dark silhouettes. Tears flowed down her cheeks, though Dong Xingjian had surprised her and left her disappointed. Still, she had once held a fondness for him. She couldn’t accept it immediately and cast a longing glance at Luo Tian before following Hu Zhiyong.

“Luo大哥, if you can enter Kunlun Mountain, remember to find me!” Su Yeyu swayed her body and approached Luo Tian. Her voice was intoxicating.

“Buzz…” A wave of spiritual energy surged from behind Luo Tian, and the lingering heat from his Blazing Heaven Fire Formation vanished instantly. The temperature of the entire mountain dropped abruptly.

Luo Tian felt a chill down his spine. He naturally knew whose aura it was. He nodded reluctantly.

Su Yeyu stuck out her tongue, a playful smile on her face, and followed the others into the carriage.

“Roar…” Since Long Bao’bao appeared, Longma had remained crouched on the ground. The authority of the Dragon Emperor was beyond what an ordinary beast could endure.

After Long Bao’bao vanished, Longma trembled and stood up. It let out a low roar before carrying everyone toward Kunlun Mountain.

Luo Tian watched the carriage disappear and turned to see Gu Qianxue staring at him with a cold expression. Gu Lei stood beside her, watching the scene.

Seeing Gu Qianxue’s jealous look, Luo Tian felt a surge of amusement. He waved his hand: “Hmph? Why is there so much jealousy?”

“Hmph…” Gu Qianxue let out a cold snort.

“Qianxue, it’s been two years. Have you missed me?” Luo Tian rubbed his hands and reached out to grab Gu Qianxue’s hand.

“Hmph, go away… In these two years, you’ve had quite a few sisters. You can easily find one in any city. Tell me, how many sisters have you taken in these two years?” Gu Qianxue’s face turned serious, her eyes filled with hostility.

“No, no…” Luo Tian rubbed his hands and explained.

“Do you not know who I am? Look at my appearance. Who would be interested in me? That girl must be blind!”

Luo Tian cried out in innocence, but as soon as he spoke, a sense of unease washed over him.

“What do you mean by ‘interested in me’? Eyes so blind? Say it again! I’ll see!” Gu Qianxue’s expression darkened further.

Gu Lei stood by and couldn’t help but laugh out loud at Luo Tian’s words.

“Go away…” Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue turned their attention to Gu Lei at the same time.

“Gu Lei, your strength has increased these two years. The poison pills you gave me—what kind of pills were they? Qianxue, I’ll tell you…” Luo Tian spoke at length about the effects of Gu Lei’s poison pills, shifting Gu Qianxue’s attention to Gu Lei.

“Gu Lei, I didn’t expect you to have such a hobby. Since Luo Tian has so many sisters, was it also your teaching? I remember now, back in Tianyuan City, you were quite the flirt. You had plenty of sisters too!” Gu Qianxue said with a menacing tone.

“Not sister, don’t listen to Luo Tian’s nonsense… Ah… Sister! Let me explain! Sister!” The mountain base of Duanyou was filled with Gu Lei’s cries.

Luo Tian smiled, a warm feeling rising in his heart. He sighed: “I really wish this could continue forever!”

Half an hour later…

Gu Lei returned with a bruised face, his expression filled with resentment. He looked at Luo Tian; if he were a woman, it would be the image of a desolate concubine.

“What’s your plan next?” Gu Qianxue returned to her serious demeanor and asked.

Hearing Gu Qianxue’s question, Luo Tian wore a bitter expression: “Originally I planned to follow them into Kunlun Mountain and figure it out. Unexpectedly, I met you all here. By the way, since you came from the Southern Region, do you know where the teleportation array in the Eastern Region is?”

“Of course I do. If you want to return to the Northern Region, you naturally have to enter Kunlun Mountain. Kunlun Mountain is a closed microcosm, but anyone entering the Eastern Region through the teleportation array must first enter Kunlun Mountain. In fact, those who enter from the teleportation array don’t know what the Eastern Region is like. They all think Kunlun Mountain is the entire Eastern Region!” Gu Qianxue explained patiently to Luo Tian about Kunlun Mountain’s situation, including where the teleportation array in the Eastern Region was located.

Hearing Gu Qianxue’s explanation, Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with battle intent. He sighed: “I’ll see what kind of place Kunlun Mountain is!”

Chapter 340: Entrance

Chapter 340: Entrance

Kunlun Mountain, the most mysterious entity in the Eastern Region and a legendary gathering place for most sects of the Eastern Region, has long been revered by commoners in the Eastern Region.

Due to generations of reverence, many commoners also call Kunlun Mountain "Immortal Mountain," often dreaming of cultivation and immortality, coming to the foot of Kunlun Mountain in hopes of finding a chance at immortal fortune.

At that moment, two men and one woman approached the foot of Kunlun Mountain amidst swirling mist. They chatted and laughed as they entered its base.

“Is this Kunlun Mountain?” Luo Tian gazed in awe at the towering mountain, unable to see its peak. It seemed like a bridge connecting heaven and earth.

The spiritual energy here was far stronger than that of Lishui City. Luo Tian was curious about where the entrance to this independent microcosm within Kunlun Mountain was.

Luo Tian had never heard of such a microcosm before. His heart was filled with curiosity.

“Let’s go… I’ll take you in, but we still need to use the two dead men's talismans!” Gu Qianxue smiled and told Luo Tian.

“Uh…” Luo Tian nodded, taking a jade tablet engraved with the words "Kunlun" in his hand. He could vaguely see a golden character at the lower right corner of the tablet.

“Take it first. You’ll need it when entering Kunlun Mountain. Without this jade tablet, you’ll be repelled by the outer barrier of Kunlun Mountain!” Gu Qianxue warned seriously. Both Gu Lei and Gu Qianxue also held a jade tablet similar to Luo Tian’s.

Luo Tian didn’t know how to enter, so he obediently followed them. They walked around the vast Kunlun Mountain.

Not long after, Luo Tian didn’t know how long they had walked. He only knew that they hadn’t completed a full circle around Kunlun Mountain.

Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei stopped, their faces showing a serious expression. They exchanged glances before nodding to Luo Tian: “It should be here.”

“Huh…” Luo Tian gazed at the massive mountain body, clearly made of stone. He couldn’t see any signs of an entrance.

“I’ll try first!” Gu Lei said softly, holding the jade tablet in his hand. He stepped back a few steps, his eyes filled with an enigmatic smile. He was thinking about how he would disappear from Luo Tian’s sight upon entering Kunlun Mountain, and he was happy at the thought.

Luo Tian watched Gu Lei with suspicion. If it weren’t for Gu Qianxue being present, Luo Tian would have definitely stopped Gu Lei. After all, Gu Lei’s image in his mind was unreliable.

Gu Lei bowed slightly and pushed off the ground. His body shot forward like an arrow, charging toward the seemingly solid mountain wall.

“Are you sure this is the entrance to Kunlun Mountain?” Luo Tian’s lips twitched as he asked Gu Qianxue.

“Not sure!” Gu Qianxue’s lips curled slightly as she replied.

“Then why… Pf…” Luo Tian hadn’t finished his sentence when a dull sound echoed in his ears.

“Someone has to test it, right?” Gu Qianxue said casually.

“Ahh…” Gu Lei cried out, clutching his head as he fell to the ground. A purple lump rose rapidly on his head, and he wore a look of resentment as he gazed at Gu Qianxue.

“Sister! I am your younger brother, and you would betray me like this!” Gu Lei roared at Gu Qianxue, rubbing his head.

“Was it not you who wanted to see Luo Tian’s expression of shock? Blame me?” Gu Qianxue said softly, a smile on her face.

“Huh?” Luo Tian didn’t know what the sister and brother were up to.

“Okay, I don’t want to watch. Let Luo Tian do it!” Gu Lei grumbled, his mouth complaining. The previous hit hadn’t injured him but had left his head ringing.

“What’s going on?” Luo Tian sighed, raising an eyebrow at the two siblings.

After hearing Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei’s explanation, Luo Tian felt both amused and exasperated. It turned out that Kunlun Mountain’s outer perimeter was surrounded by a massive illusion and barrier. What people saw was indeed the mountain, but there was one spot that served as the entrance to Kunlun Mountain. Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei were also searching for it for the first time. They had previously exited with Dong Xingxia and that youth in the Bone-Devouring Realm Late Stage, only remembering a rough location.

Gu Qianxue had previously deceived Gu Lei, saying she wanted to see Luo Tian’s expression of shock. She believed that when he collided with the mountain wall and entered Kunlun Mountain, Luo Tian would be astonished. Thus she had incited Gu Lei to open the path for her and Luo Tian. And Gu Lei had indeed fulfilled Gu Qianxue’s expectations, colliding solidly with the mountain wall.

After hearing Gu Qianxue's explanation, Luo Tian felt both amused and exasperated. He hadn’t expected Gu Qianxue to have such a side.

“I’m not going in. Do whatever you want! It hurts too much!” Gu Lei wrapped his arms, looking at Gu Qianxue with resentment. He had clearly realized that his sister was favoring Luo Tian.

“You don’t want to try? Then let me!” Gu Qianxue clenched her fists, a threatening expression on her face.

“You still have Luo Tian!” Gu Lei scowled, looking at Luo Tian.

“I can’t. I’m only in the Ninth Stage of Body Refinement. I can't endure this!” Luo Tian waved his hands, a bitter smile on his face. That was solidly colliding with the mountain; he couldn’t withstand it. Gu Lei’s bloody example was right in front of him.

“Anyway, I’m not going!” Gu Lei took a defensive stance.

“Okay, let’s vote. Raise your hands if you agree that Gu Lei should go!” Luo Tian said seriously.

“Oppose!”

“Invalid vote!”

“Swish!” Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue both raised their hands high.

“You two have no humanity! Sister, I am your younger brother. Don’t treat me like this after getting a husband!” Gu Lei looked at the two of them with a loud cry.

“Go away…” Gu Qianxue’s face turned red, and she kicked Gu Lei away.

Gu Lei had no choice but to submit under his sister’s authority. They continued searching for the entrance to Kunlun Mountain.

“Gu Lei, here!”

“Pf…”

“Here…”

“Pf…”

Though Kunlun Mountain wasn’t heavily traveled, some commoners still came here hoping to luck out and join an immortal sect.

“Who is that person? Is he crazy for wanting immortality? Why would he hit Kunlun Mountain? A fool, thinking he could knock out the immortals!” Anyone who met Luo Tian and his group looked at Gu Lei with a scornful expression.

Chapter 341: Entering Kunlun Mountain

Chapter 341: Entering Kunlun Mountain

Ignoring the laughter of onlookers, Gu Lei's head felt like it had grown a few sizes larger. His face bore resentment as he gazed at Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue.

“I… I’ll try one more time!” Gu Lei gritted his teeth and spoke.

“Okay, okay!” Luo Tian saw it was about time and nodded quickly.

Gu Lei charged toward the mountain wall as usual, his face resolute. He even closed his eyes.

“Buzz…” No dull sound was heard as expected. Gu Lei’s golden talisman in his hand allowed him to vanish into the mountain body.

“Tsk tsk, so magical!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly and took out a pill to change his appearance again.

“Let’s go in!” Gu Qianxue wore a faintly sad expression and pulled Luo Tian's hand. She knew that after entering Kunlun Mountain, they would soon part ways. Her heart felt a little sad.

Feeling the warmth of her hand, Luo Tian also wore a look of sadness. He tightly gripped her small hand.

They walked forward slowly, and both Gu Lei and Luo Tian vanished into the mountain body. They disappeared from sight.

“Buzz…” This feeling was familiar to Luo Tian. He really wanted to ask these great cultivators why they liked teleportation so much. Though he felt it was pleasant to do this to others, being teleported wasn’t that beautiful.

After a wave of dizziness, Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue landed on the ground. As soon as they touched down, Luo Tian was stunned.

“According to Gu Lei and Gu Qianxue, Kunlun Mountain is a microcosm. I thought it wasn’t very big, but upon entering, he realized how wrong he was. It was completely a sacred place for cultivation.

Luo Tian felt the spiritual energy in Kunlun Mountain was unusually dense, his face filled with astonishment.

Seeing Luo Tian’s expression, Gu Qianxue knew what he was thinking. She smiled: “Okay, don’t be stunned. Kunlun Mountain is much stronger than the Northern Region. Even compared to the vast and rich Southern Region, it’s definitely no match!”

“Just what is this dense spiritual energy formed from? Is the underground made of a Spirit Pulse?” Luo Tian’s face showed greed as he gazed at the ground.

Gu Qianxue had a black line on her face. She thought Luo Tian was admiring the spiritual energy, but he was actually thinking about the Spirit Pulse beneath the ground.

“Ah, you’ve finally entered. I was worried you’d stay for a while!” Gu Lei rubbed his head and walked over from the distance. The large purple lump on his head had mostly disappeared, leaving Luo Tian to marvel at Gu Lei’s strong recovery power in the Bone-Devouring Realm Mid-Stage.

“Go away…” Gu Qianxue blushed and shouted, kicking Gu Lei away.

“Ah… let’s go. Remember to prioritize your own safety and life, and protect yourself. When I reach the Spirit Soul Stage, I’ll go to the Southern Region to find you and Gu Lei. No matter what, I’ll bring you out!” Luo Tian said with certainty to Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei who had returned.

“Don’t you want to walk a little with us?” Gu Qianxue looked reluctant, asking.

“Yes, we could stay a bit longer. It’s convenient! After all, you’re going to attend the joint recruitment of several major sects. We are also heading towards Tianjian Sect and Shangguan Fei’s meeting.”

Gu Lei wore a look of reluctance. He knew that his sister Gu Qianxue had been happy these two years since entering the Youming Sect. Her personality had changed drastically, becoming cold and ruthless. Even Gu Lei felt a bit unfamiliar with her. Over these two years, countless lives had been taken by them. If possible, he wanted this to continue.

“Okay, since the one who escaped still knows you two, if someone finds out I’m with you, my identity will be exposed. So I can’t stay,” Luo Tian sighed helplessly.

Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei were reluctant to part with Luo Tian, but Luo Tian was no less reluctant. If it weren’t for them saying they had restrictions on their bodies, Luo Tian would never have let them stay behind to return to Wuxing Sect. He wouldn’t go back to that cursed Youming Sect, but even if it was strong in the Northern Region, it wouldn’t dare to openly snatch people from Wuxing Sect.

“Okay, be careful,” Gu Qianxue understood the situation and gave Luo Tian a gentle reminder.

“Don’t worry, you don’t know me well enough. My life is tough!” Luo Tian smiled carelessly.

“Brother, take care!” Gu Lei’s eyes were moist as he approached Luo Tian and punched his chest.

“Take care, look after your sister!” Luo Tian lightly patted Gu Lei’s shoulder.

After comforting them both, Gu Lei and Gu Qianxue walked away under Luo Tian’s smiling gaze.

“Youming Sect, Shangguan Fei. One day I will settle the debt with Youming Sect!” Luo Tian’s eyes turned cold.

Luo Tian took out a jade slip and opened it. A map appeared in his vision. This was the map of Kunlun Mountain, a gift from Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei.

“Fenglei Terrace?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed confusion. He closed the jade slip and gazed into the distance.

“This map says I should be in the central part of Kunlun Mountain. Fenglei Terrace is at the very center, not far from here. I think I can reach it in a day!” Luo Tian murmured.

Luo Tian adjusted his posture and strode toward the direction marked on the map as Fenglei Terrace.

Along the way, Luo Tian also saw many people. What surprised him was that there were no commoners in Kunlun Mountain; the least was a Body Refinement Stage Two cultivator.

Many people were also heading toward Fenglei Terrace, as several major sects held significant power in Kunlun Mountain.

Whoever could enter a sect would be like ascending to the heavens, no longer needing to be an independent cultivator. Resources were fixed, and they could even receive guidance from great masters. Entering a sect was the dream of every cultivator in Kunlun Mountain.

“Brother! Your spiritual energy isn’t weak. I guess you’ll definitely be able to enter a sect, right? Which sect do you want to join?” As Luo Tian walked, a cheerful voice came from his side.

“Huh?” Luo Tian frowned and turned to look at the source of the voice. A youth around twenty-five or six appeared in his vision.

Chapter 342: The Young Master of Fengfeng Sect

Chapter 342: The Young Master of Fengfeng Sect

Luo Tian had experienced much and met many people. Seeing the youth before him, he knew this person was one of those who loved to talk. Even if you ignored him, he would talk for a long time. If you responded, he would never stop.

Luo Tian didn’t want to engage with him. After all, he was alone in the Eastern Region now; it was better to be cautious and avoid too many interactions.

Thinking this, Luo Tian’s feet flashed with golden light. His speed doubled, trying to shake off the youth and head toward Fenglei Terrace.

“Brother, how could you do this? Not responding to me will hurt my feelings. After all, our meeting is a fate!” Unexpectedly, the youth’s voice echoed again in Luo Tian's ears.

“Huh?” Luo Tian frowned and stopped, carefully observing the youth beside him. His face showed confusion.

Luo Tian’s speed wasn’t his full power, but it was more than enough to leave a Body Refinement Stage Nine cultivator behind. Yet the youth showed no signs of discomfort.

“Haha, that’s Fengfeng Sect's third prince. That kid really got it bad; he was targeted by him! He’s in for a lot!” Many people looked at Luo Tian with pity.

“Yes, I remember someone was chased by him for three days and nights. He ended up spitting out foam!” Another person whispered.

“Ah… there’s nothing you can do. Who else would have a good father? If it weren’t for that, his personality wouldn’t last long!” People murmured. Some pitied Luo Tian, while others were somewhat delighted.

Luo Tian naturally heard the murmurs of the crowd. His heart twitched slightly. He had heard of Fengfeng Sect before; it was one of the three major sects in Kunlun Mountain.

Luo Tian had heard that Fengfeng Sect was named so because it was originally a notorious place in the Eastern Region, one of the four forbidden lands on Tianyuan Continent. Fengfeng Sect's sect was established near this place.

The Tianyuan Continent had four forbidden lands, each located in the four regions: East Fengfeng, South Bingji, West Leihai, and North Dahan. Luo Tian naturally knew about the four forbidden lands and had even ventured deep into Dahan Forest. Fengfeng Sect being ranked among the four forbidden lands meant it was no place for the faint-hearted.

Luo Tian hadn’t expected to meet Fengfeng Sect's young master here. His face showed a slight surprise. How could the young master of Fengfeng Sect be traveling alone like these independent cultivators? Especially since most of these independent cultivators wanted to join Fengfeng Sect.

“May I ask your name, sir?” Luo Tian smiled and bowed politely.

“Haha, I knew we had a connection. My name is long to tell; it starts from before I was born. These are things I heard from my older brother and father…” The youth, rarely encountering someone who would listen carefully to him, began to talk endlessly.

Luo Tian's lips twitched as he listened. He finally understood the youth’s name: Zheng Xin, the younger son of Fengfeng Sect's master Zheng Hongsheng.

The reason for his name, "Zheng Xin," was somewhat feminine. This was because he had two older brothers. His mother had hoped for a girl and named him before giving birth, hoping for a daughter. However, his mother was determined to give birth to another son. But the name had already been set, and many friends knew this child was named Zheng Xin. So they didn’t change it.

“Ah, I see. You’re Brother Zheng. My name is Luo Lei. Nice to meet you!” Luo Tian, hearing a brief pause from Zheng Xin, quickly interrupted and revealed the name he had prepared.

Luo Tian couldn’t use his original name anymore. Not only that, but the disciple who had escaped from Tianjian Sect knew Luo Tian was in the Eastern Region. If he used his name, it would definitely raise suspicion.

Not only did he change his name, but Luo Tian also decided not to use the techniques or weapons that had been seen by that disciple from Tianjian Sect. He would only use gold and fire attributes to avoid exposing too much.

“Luo Lei! A good name! A great name! So you’re Brother Luo!” Zheng Xin sighed at the beauty of Luo Tian’s name and tried to return to his story about naming himself.

Luo Tian's lips twitched. He thought of Wu Di from Beichang County. Wu Di and this Zheng Xin were the two most peculiar people he had met since coming to the Eastern Region. Wu Di was better, as he had flattered him at first and then recovered.

But this Zheng Xin...
