"Who else wishes to kill my adoptive son?" Ye Wudao spoke again, but this time no one dared to respond. Not even the masters of the two sects ranked above Star River Sect dared to utter a word, fearing provoking this madman.

"Congratulations, Master Ye, for obtaining such an outstanding son. The Purple Obsidian Pavilion presents a modest gift; please accept it. We have always been friends of Star River Sect! The previous incident was merely an accident!" the master of Purple Obsidian Pavilion quickly praised, offering a storage ring directly to Ye Wudao's presence.

"Hmph. Then I shall overlook it," Ye Wudao chuckled, tossing the storage ring to Luo Tian.

"Tiān'er," Ye Wudao addressed Luo Tian, "someone has gifted you; accept it. After all, your injuries were quite severe."

"I too," Huangshan Sect's master hurriedly presented a gift, his face twisted in servility.

"Little Master!" the disciples of Shenglong Sect gazed at Luo Tian, instantly joining Star River Sect and being protected by Ye Wudao. Their hearts churned with mixed emotions.

"We were simply not strong enough; that's why Little Master left Shenglong Sect. If we had been powerful like Star River Sect, they wouldn't have dared say a word!" All Shenglong Sect disciples inwardly raged, recalling the moment Luo Tian had been forced to leave their sect. Their hearts ached like being cut by knives.

"It's fine. Shenglong Sect is indeed too small; he needs greater opportunities. Star River Sect truly suits Luo Tian!"

"When Shenglong Sect grows stronger, we'll openly reclaim Luo Tian from Star River Sect!" Sima Xiu sighed deeply.

"Alright, since there's nothing more to discuss, the Struggle for Heaven has ended. I'll take my people back now. Star River Sect always welcomes you to debate!" Ye Wudao laughed heartily, leading his sect's disciples away from sight.

Chapter 1996: Entering Star River Sect

Numerous masters of the Middle Heaven Region watched Ye Wudao's group depart, sighing deeply before leading their disciples back to their sects.

As the Middle Heaven Region's sects departed, only Shenglong Sect remained. Their disciples bore no joy in their eyes, for they had lost too much in this battle.

Millions of disciples were reduced to over a million, plus the captured Shenglong Sect members now totaled less than three million.

Though these three million were elites, they had lost brothers and friends.

Shenglong Sect's base was slaughtered; not a single soul remained. Little Master Luo Tian, expelled from the sect, had no choice but to join Star River Sect.

Though they succeeded in the Struggle for Heaven, they felt deeply humiliated. All Shenglong Sect disciples now shared one thought: to grow stronger, powerful enough to make a hundred sects fear them. Then they would personally reclaim Little Master.

"If you face any trouble in the future, we can help!" Several sect masters who had succeeded in the Struggle for Heaven said, addressing Zang Yunfei and his companions before flying away.

Though they had succeeded in the Struggle for Heaven, Zang Yunfei and his companions knew entering the Middle Heaven Region still required caution. The Middle Heaven Region was far more ruthless than the Lower Heaven Region.

Though the Middle Heaven Region was vast, it had been divided among a hundred sects. After Shenglong Sect defeated Guiyuan Sect, all of Guiyuan's power now belonged to Shenglong Sect. A sect's strength was a juicy prize.

A month of protection was too short, barely enough for Shenglong Sect disciples to settle into Guiyuan's territory and fully take over its power.

After a month, many sects would surely eye Shenglong Sect, gradually devouring its resources.

"Let's go. Whatever we've fought for, we must hold on to it!" Zang Yunfei and his companions sighed deeply. Though the road ahead was difficult, the Struggle for Heaven was only the first step; whether they could establish themselves in the Middle Heaven Region remained to be seen.

...

The Struggle for Heaven had not seen a successful sect in centuries, but Shenglong Sect's success made them the talk of the Middle Heaven Region. Everyone spoke of Shenglong Sect.

Luo Tian's name spread throughout the Middle Heaven Region, for his performance in the Struggle for Heaven was astonishing. Every action he took surpassed what a Celestial Peak could achieve.

"Number one under the Immortal Realm. If paired with four top-grade immortal artifacts, even an Immortal Peak could be wounded. This is a conservative estimate; after all, Luo Tian's arrow that killed an Immortal Peak used the Great God Array. That strange lotus flame wasn't even his doing, people speculated it could only be used once.

Even more enviable was Luo Tian's entry into Star River Sect, becoming Ye Wudao's adoptive son and one of Star River Sect's three Dao Sons.

In Star River Sect, Luo Tian sat cross-legged on his bed, eyes closed. His body was wrapped in black qi, and his power continuously rose. A suction force emanated from every limb, absorbing the dense immortal energy within Star River Sect.

"Crack..." A brittle sound echoed. Luo Tian's face was drenched in sweat, a golden-black immortal pill covered with five cracks absorbed the black qi.

This black qi was what Luo Tian had absorbed from residual demon seeds. Due to time constraints, he had used most of his cultivation power to draw the Sun-Seeking Bow. His absorption was hasty, leaving much of his cultivation power lingering within him.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, a sense of admiration in his gaze. His body ached, and he sighed deeply.

That day, Ye Wudao had brought him back. He had been in seclusion for a month now.

"Indeed, battle is the best way to enhance one's strength. Now I'm just a step away from becoming a half-immortal. I suppose the disciples of Shenglong Sect have also improved greatly!"

"A month has passed; I wonder how Shenglong Sect is doing!" Luo Tian slowly stood up, his body emitting a series of cracking sounds.

Looking around the room, Luo Tian smiled: "At last, I've entered Star River Sect!"

He stood up and pushed open the door. Outside, Nan Gong Yuqing and others bore a faint air of wind and frost, standing there. This warmed Luo Tian's heart.

"How are you?" Nan Gong Yuqing asked, but upon sensing Luo Tian's power, their faces showed a hint of smiles.

"Nothing serious," Luo Tian shook his head. Ye Liangchen also hurriedly arrived from the entrance, accompanied by a group of纨绔 disciples.

"Senior Brother Tian, you've emerged from seclusion! Once you entered Star River Sect, you can rest easy. This is my territory; no one dares harm you!" Ye Liangchen loudly declared, his voice filled with excitement.

"Liangchen, take me to meet Father," Luo Tian softly said. This time he owed Ye Wudao a great favor. Before seclusion, Ye Wudao had told him to visit after emerging.

"You all stay here. I'll be back shortly!" Luo Tian addressed everyone before following Ye Liangchen towards Star River Sect's central hall.

Star River Sect was immense, spanning millions of square li. All were under Star River Sect's control. Beyond a million li, Star River Sect's allies also stationed there. Other Middle Heaven Region sects under Star River Sect's leadership were part of the Nine Immortal Mountains' direct lineage, Mount Buxian.

Star River Sect was undoubtedly one of the Middle Heaven Region's dominant forces. Even Star River Sect's elders maintained an unbreakable relationship with Mount Buxian. Ye Liangchen had once trained at Mount Buxian, where he met Jiang Yuzhe.

"Is that Luo Tian? The one who killed an Immortal Peak?"

"That's right. If it weren't for him, Shenglong Sect might have failed in the Struggle for Heaven!"

"Master Ye has keen eyes; he directly took him into Star River Sect, making him one of the three Dao Sons!" Star River Sect disciples gazed at Ye Liangchen and Luo Tian, their eyes filled with envy. Recently, Luo Tian's fame had spread too widely.

"Who would win between Ye Chen and this Luo Tian?" People then mentioned a name, another Dao Son of Star River Sect.

"That Ye Chen is also my father's adoptive son. However, he has been in seclusion recently. He's another Dao Son. As for the third Dao Son, that's me!" Ye Liangchen's eyes gleamed with pride as he introduced Luo Tian.

"Senior Brother Tian, don't underestimate Ye Chen. He's also a ruthless person. He was found by my uncle and trained as the future leader of Iron Blood Hall. His strength has killed an Immortal Initial!" Ye Liangchen spoke, his voice filled with admiration.

"Ye Tian!" Luo Tian suddenly recalled Ye Liangchen's uncle, Ye Tian, the cold-hearted man.

"Father has appointed him as Liangchen's guardian and also his base!" Luo Tian instantly understood Ye Wudao's intentions.

Ye Liangchen, Ye Wudao's only son, would inevitably become Star River Sect's master. Whether it was Luo Tian or Ye Chen, they were Liangchen's supports.

After walking for an hour, Ye Liangchen led Luo Tian into the towering hall. Ye Liangchen was nonchalant, pushing open the door and entering.

Upon entering the hall, over a dozen people sat there, their faces bearing authority. Their eyes scrutinized Luo Tian.

"Tiān'er has arrived!" Ye Wudao chuckled, addressing Luo Tian. Behind him stood Ye Tian, like a shadow.

"There's still someone missing!" Luo Tian's eyes flickered slightly. He felt a spiritual awareness scanning the hall, finally settling on him. If his soul wasn't strong enough, he wouldn't have sensed it.

"Respectful greeting to Father!" Luo Tian knelt on one knee, bowing respectfully to Ye Wudao.

"Rise quickly. From now on, you needn't be so formal. After all, you are my adoptive son; don't feel out of place!" Ye Wudao smiled.

"I called you here to introduce Star River Sect's uncles and elders!" Ye Wudao chuckled, pointing at Ye Tian behind him.

"This is your uncle Ye Tian. You've already met him; I won't introduce again."

"This is your uncle... this is..." Ye Wudao continuously introduced Luo Tian, causing Luo Tian's lips to twitch. Everyone in the hall bore the surname Ye, and each was Ye Liangchen's uncle. Though not as close as Ye Wudao and Ye Tian, they weren't too distant either.

Luo Tian respectfully greeted each person. However, when he bowed to an elder, the elder's face was icy cold, which surprised Luo Tian. Yet he didn't pay much attention.

"Star River Sect has nearly one million disciples and elders combined. The Ye family comprises almost two hundred thousand, all direct descendants of our clan!" Ye Wudao softly spoke, continuously introducing.

"Alright, there's nothing more. Everyone go about your business. Let Ye Tian explain the rules to him; no one understands it better than he does!" Ye Wudao chuckled, addressing the people.

"Master, we'll take our leave then!" Each elder spoke, rising and leaving without further words. They only glanced at Luo Tian before exiting the hall.

The entire hall now had only Luo Tian, Ye Liangchen, and the four Ye brothers.

"Kid, have you met them all?"

"Some of these people aren't on our side. The Ye family is too large; naturally, some have their own ambitions!" Ye Wudao asked Luo Tian, his voice carrying a smile.

"Yes, I've mostly met them," Luo Tian nodded. He also knew that the larger the faction, the more complex the relationships. In Star River Sect, where everything was controlled by one family, it was even more chaotic, like a vast vortex. Anyone who made the slightest mistake could be crushed.

"The elder who was cold to you is Ye Han, the head of the external branch. He's been ambitious for years, hence his coldness toward you!" Ye Wudao softly spoke.

"I see," Luo Tian nodded, sensing Star River Sect wasn't as peaceful as it seemed.

"Also, be cautious of some people among them. However, even we aren't sure who they are!" Ye Wudao sighed deeply.

Chapter 1997: Guarding Hell

"What do you want me to do, Father?" Luo Tian asked Ye Wudao, his voice solemn. He knew Ye Wudao had called him for an important matter.

"Though the sects in the Middle Heaven Region appear complex, they're also engaged in open and covert struggles. Although I saved you before, no one dared interfere because I hadn't touched their fundamental interests."

"In other words, although your talent is outstanding and you'll surely become a strong cultivator in the future, now you can only threaten them slightly. It's almost nonexistent!"

"Each sect has its own foundation. Though your methods are strong, they can't affect them much. If these sects truly wanted to kill you, it would be effortless!"

"So be careful. Within Star River Sect's territory, no one dares touch you. But outside of it, no one can protect you!"

"Also, within Star River Sect, some people don't want our lineage to continue as master. Since you're my adoptive son, they might attack you, both openly and secretly. You must be aware of this!"

"What I want you to do is ensure Liangchen becomes Star River Sect's master and a pillar of the sect!"

"I don't trust others, but I do trust you as Liangchen's brother. There's also Ye Chen; the two of you will become Star River Sect's backbone!"

"Liangchen is a纨绔, unqualified. So it all depends on you and Ye Chen!" Ye Wudao softly sighed, gazing at Ye Liangchen.

"Father, rest assured. Liangchen is my brother; I'll ensure he becomes the master!" Luo Tian slightly bowed.

"You are also my son. If you call me Father, whoever harms you, I'll kill them!" Ye Wudao's voice carried an icy chill.

Luo Tian gazed at Ye Wudao's eyes, his heart trembling. He felt a flicker of emotion in Ye Wudao's gaze. Though it was only a slight wave, it touched Luo Tian's heart.

"Luonantian!" Luo Tian thought of his father, Luonantian. Back then, he had said the same thing to him.

"I am Luonantian's son. Who harms him, I'll kill them!" A霸道 voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind. Though it had been countless years, Luo Tian still clearly remembered.

"Paternal love is like a mountain!" Four words rose in Luo Tian's heart. Though Ye Wudao seemed霸道, he was ultimately a father with only one son, Ye Liangchen.

"I've already arranged for Shenglong Sect; it won't be destroyed, but its power will definitely shrink!" Ye Wudao continued. Unexpectedly, his casual words stirred Luo Tian.

"Next, let's get to the main issue. These were just warnings for you. As my adoptive son and one of the three Dao Sons, your status is naturally high in Star River Sect. The resources you receive will be no different from Liangchen and Ye Chen!"

"Also, in a few days, the Washing Star Pool will open. This is a major event that might even awaken Star River Sect's foundation. I hope you can help Liangchen obtain the Celestial Pole Star from the Washing Star Pool, aiding him in its fusion and enhancing his cultivation!"

"Liangchen's cultivation method is the Starlight Great Dao. If he gains Celestial Pole Star's approval, his progress will be twice as fast. Moreover, when he ascends to Immortal, he might become a Supreme Immortal!"

"This Washing Star Pool's opening will be a selection. No matter what, you and Ye Chen must draw the foundation's attention because those who shine in this selection will be assigned to guard Hell according to the Nine Immortal Mountains' rules."

"Liangchen, as Star River Sect's future master, must also participate. You and Ye Chen will go as attendants to ensure Liangchen's safety!" Ye Wudao continuously spoke.

"HELL!" Luo Tian's heart trembled. Having arrived in the Immortal Realm, he had learned about Hell's existence and even witnessed Jiang Taibai personally subduing the Eight Ghost Generals of Hell.

"Dad, can I skip this? Hell is too dangerous!" Hearing Ye Wudao's words, Ye Liangchen instinctively shivered.

"No use. This Hell journey is unavoidable. For years, you've played the纨绔 to avoid guarding Hell!"

"In fact, it did work. If it were earlier, each sect would have sent their strongest disciples. Ye Chen could have replaced you. Even other Star River Sect geniuses could have, but this time the Nine Immortal Mountains changed the rules. The heir must go!"

"Although Star River Sect has some status, this rule can't be broken. Mount Buxian has already issued an order: all sect heirs must participate. Each can bring ten attendants, no more!" Ye Wudao also sighed helplessly.

"Damn it, all that acting was in vain. I'm so tired! In the end, I still couldn't escape!" Ye Liangchen complained.

"Alright, you didn't act in vain. It has already caused some people to nearly break through!" Ye Wudao's eyes were deep, and Ye Tian also radiated a chill.

"Someone is about to face misfortune!" Seeing Ye Wudao's gaze, Luo Tian knew someone in Star River Sect was about to face trouble. Perhaps it was those with ulterior motives.

"You two go back. The Washing Star Pool will open in seven days. Ye Chen is in seclusion, trying to break through half-immortal; he might not come out. So it's up to the two of you to enter the Washing Star Pool!" Ye Wudao smiled, addressing Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen.

"Dad, what do you mean I still have to act the纨绔?" Ye Liangchen's eyes showed seriousness. His demeanor had changed, like Ye Wudao.

"Exactly, you must continue to act the纨绔. When someone shows their tail, we can stop acting after we catch them!"

"This time, the Washing Star Pool's opening might make some people restless and reveal small fry. Tiān'er, when that happens, you can stomp them. Killing the small ones will reveal the big ones!" Ye Wudao chuckled, addressing Luo Tian.

"Yes," Luo Tian nodded, following Ye Liangchen out of the hall. Ye Wudao and Ye Tian remained seated in the hall.

"Brother, when do we close the net?" Ye Wudao softly asked, his voice echoing in the hall.

"When I emerge from seclusion. Also, when Liangchen returns from Hell, we've prepared for so long; it's about time. Then we'll catch them all in one net!" An old voice echoed in the hall.

"This Luo Tian is good, a promising seedling. Though he's defiant, Liangchen becoming his friend means he might be Liangchen's major support in the future!"

"But everything depends on this Luo Tian growing stronger!" An aged voice echoed, and then the hall fell silent.

...

On another front, Ye Liangchen led Luo Tian arrogantly through Star River Sect's main road. The surrounding disciples all showed deep respect.

"Senior Brother Tian, once Ye Chen emerges from seclusion, the three of us will dominate the Middle Heaven Region! Ha!" Ye Liangchen spoke continuously to Luo Tian.

"Liāngchén, trouble! Ye Hong has brought people and is fighting with ours!" Just as Ye Liangchen finished boasting, a纨绔 disciple hurriedly ran to Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen's side, urgently speaking.

"Who? Ye Hong? Damn it, his dog courage dares to touch my people!" Ye Liangchen immediately cursed, his boasting was interrupted by someone daring to attack his people.

"Brother, listen to why," Luo Tian shook his head, sighing at Ye Liangchen's acting. It was truly convincing, with no flaws.

"Because of a woman! Ye Hong's sister Ye Meier claimed Nan Gong Yuqing had harassed her. So Ye Hong led people to trouble Nan Gong Yuqing, and they fought!" The disciple loudly spoke. As the three of them arrived at the scene of the incident.

The sound of combat echoed continuously, two groups clashing. Though they didn't hold back, the fluctuations were massive.

Around them, a crowd of Star River Sect disciples watched the fighting figures, whispering among themselves.

"That Nan Gong Yuqing looks respectable, but he did this. He deserves to die!"

"Those guys aren't good either. After such an incident, Master Liangchen should be angry. After all, although Master Liangchen is a bit of a纨绔, he hates this kind of thing. He might even personally kill them!"

"Newcomers dared to do this, so bold! I've always disliked these guys!" People's whispers echoed in the crowd.

"Stop fighting, you bastards!" Ye Liangchen shouted, rushing through the crowd to stand before them.

"Master, you must avenge me! This Nan Gong Yuqing may look respectable in front of you, but he secretly approached me several times with lewd words. If I hadn't escaped quickly, he would have succeeded!" As Ye Liangchen appeared, a woman crying with tears ran to his side, grabbing his arm.

"Cough... cough..." Luo Tian looked at the woman and coughed, a smile in his eyes.

The woman wasn't ugly; she was just average. But what made Luo Tian uncomfortable was the layer of makeup on her face and her bright red lips, which seemed to have devoured people. Her fragrance spread far, and she wore a red dress with seductive eyes, constantly rubbing her arms against Ye Liangchen's, making Luo Tian's skin crawl.

"Hey, stop fighting, didn't you hear me?" Ye Liangchen also shivered slightly, then pulled his arm out of the woman's grasp and shouted at the fighting group.

Chapter 1998: Washing Star Pool

"Boom..." A dull sound echoed. Nan Gong Yuqing's group stopped fighting, their eyes coldly gazing at the opposing youths.

"Who do you think you are to insult us? You're overconfident!" Ren Hongzhe's face showed disdain, gazing at the opposing youths.

The youths all panted heavily. They stared at Nan Gong Yuqing's group. Though they had been in Star River Sect for a while, they weren't of the Ye family, so no one paid attention to them. No one knew their strength.

But during the fight, their terrifying power was revealed. They had completely dominated them. Only Ye Hong managed to match Nan Gong Yuqing.

"Damn it, if I could kill you, I would have!" Li Tianzhi also shouted, gazing at the opposing youths.

They had fought countless battles and were ascended beings. Their cultivation in the Immortal Realm was also great, now reaching Celestial Peak Late Stage.

But their methods were all killing techniques. Fighting like this made them hesitant, and the opponent's identity was sensitive in Star River Sect. If things escalated, it would cause trouble.

"What's going on?" Ye Liangchen frowned, gazing at the youths opposing Nan Gong Yuqing.

Dressed in blue robes with disheveled hair, but their eyes were bright. They glared at Nan Gong Yuqing and then turned to Ye Liangchen, a flicker of disdain in their eyes.

"Master, this Nan Gong Yuqing used his strength to insult my sister. I caught him in the act and wanted to take him for trial by our clan, but he resisted and called for help!" Ye Hong spoke loudly, his voice filled with madness, as if willing to sacrifice everything for his sister.

"Yes, Liangchen Brother, you must avenge me! I'm still a maiden!" As Ye Hong's words finished, Ye Meier ran to Ye Liangchen's side again, speaking and trying to rub against him. Her words made Luo Tian's skin crawl.

Luo Tian suppressed his nausea, glancing at Ye Meier's legs. They clearly showed she had often engaged in intercourse. His eyes held a smile.

"Interesting, your speed is fast. I just arrived and already knew Nan Gong Yuqing was friendly with me!" Luo Tian thought to himself.

"Shut up, you bastard!" Ye Liangchen didn't care. He couldn't help but scold, feeling nauseous, especially at Ye Meier's fragrance.

"Master, please avenge us!" The people who had fought against Nan Gong Yuqing and were beaten up shouted loudly.

"Damn it, so disgusting. Even if you're naked in front of us, we wouldn't get hard. You say you harassed her? I've never seen someone with such thick skin!"

"It's no wonder, she put on so much makeup. It must be invulnerable!" Diao Dezhù and Ren Hongzhe cursed, their verbal abuse unmatched.

"Enough. Ye Hong, take your people and leave. This is my people. Everyone in Star River Sect knows what Ye Meier's like!" Ye Liangchen's eyes showed disdain.

"Master, you're a Dao Son. How dare you favor them? This will make us lowly branch members不服!" Ye Hong smiled, but he thought Ye Liangchen was a纨绔 and unfit to be a Dao Son. However, Ye Liangchen was the descendant of Ye Wudao's main branch and thus held a higher status.

The other Dao Son was Ye Chen, also an adoptive son of Ye Wudao. He was loyal to the Ye family and strong, everyone knew he was Ye Liangchen's guardian. Ye Liangchen's ascension as Star River Sect master depended on him.

Those branch members wanted to compete, so they targeted the third Dao Son of Star River Sect. But who would have thought a Luo Tian would emerge, making the three Dao Sons without any branch members. How could they accept it?

This incident even stirred the elders of the branches, hence this event. They aimed to remove Luo Tian's Dao Son status and let a branch genius take the third position.

According to Star River Sect rules, all three Dao Sons had opportunities to become Star River Sect's master. This was what the branch members had long targeted, so they invested heavily in cultivating a Dao Son candidate. This was secretly done, no one knew who the branch had cultivated.

"Are you a Dao Son? I am! How dare you question my Dao Son?" Hearing Ye Hong's words, Ye Liangchen's face changed, like an angry rooster.

"Damn it, I'm so angry! Daring to question the great Star River Sect Dao Son. Come on, come on! These bastards have committed insubordination; catch them and throw them in the Star Prison for ten or fifteen days!" Ye Liangchen shouted, acting like a master.

"This..." The surrounding Star River Sect disciples hesitated, gazing at Ye Liangchen.

"What are you looking at? Are you trying to force me to use the Iron Blood Hall?"

"If I use the Iron Blood Hall, it would be a big deal. All of you would be guilty!" Ye Liangchen shouted loudly, acting like a spoiled second-generation.

"Really shameless. But I find this kid more endearing now. His arrogance, I like it! Ha!" Ren Hongzhe laughed.

"Yes, back then in the Demon Region, I was also so mighty. After Luo Tian became the纪元主, I was also so arrogant! But now in the Immortal Realm, I haven't even become a person yet!" Diao Dezhù sighed, gazing at Ye Liangchen's arrogant display.

"Yes," the surrounding disciples heard about the Iron Blood Hall and their faces changed, instinctively shivering before shouting loudly, surrounding Ye Hong's group.

Hundreds of disciples, and those present were Star River Sect's elites. Their strength was Celestial Peak Mid to Late Stage. They rushed in, instantly subduing Ye Hong's group.

"Go," Ye Liangchen waved his hand. "Tell Uncle Ye Tian I sent them. If there's anything, I'll take responsibility!"

A group escorted Ye Hong and others out of Luo Tian's sight.

"See? In Star River Sect, I am like a god. As long as you don't betray the sect, anything can be covered for you!" Ye Liangchen patted his chest proudly, a look of pride on his face.

"Ha! Brother Liangchen, you truly are one of us. Come on, let's go get drunk!" Ren Hongzhe laughed, approaching Ye Liangchen.

They all laughed and didn't take the incident seriously. Arrogantly, they entered Luo Tian's courtyard, starting to celebrate.

Diao Dezhù and Ren Hongzhe were easy-going people. They quickly became friends with Ye Liangchen and those other纨绔 disciples, calling each other brothers.

"Was that to suppress you?" Nan Gong Yuqing and Luo Tian sat together, frowning slightly.

Nan Gong Yuqing wasn't stupid. They had been in Star River Sect for a while without issues, but as soon as Luo Tian arrived and met Ye Wudao, trouble arose.

"They have connections; they used you to suppress me. But using such trash as Ye Hong and Ye Meier is really looking down on me!" Luo Tian chuckled.

"We four plan to leave Star River Sect!" Nan Gong Yuqing spoke, his gaze filled with emotion.

"Star River Sect is ultimately Star River Sect. It's not ours. We still hope for freedom!" Nan Gong Yuqing spoke, they had originally been robbers and disliked sect rules. They joined Star River Sect only to familiarize themselves with the Middle Heaven Region's illusion.

"Be careful,"

"The Middle Heaven Region is different from other places. Without a sect behind you, you'll be stuck at every step. Tomorrow I'll talk to Father and have him assign a task for you, then you can go out. Backing Star River Sect makes things easier!" Luo Tian softly spoke.

"Yes, rest assured," Nan Gong Yuqing nodded.

...

While Luo Tian and others chatted, in a courtyard of Star River Sect, an old man with coldness listened to a middle-aged man recounting the incident.

"Go down," the old man was Ye Han, the leader of the branch, and the elder who had coldly treated Luo Tian earlier.

"This Ye Liangchen has been acting the纨绔 for so long. Now he's still faking it; that's interesting. With the Washing Star Pool opening, it's time to take this step. First kill this little one in the Washing Star Pool!"

"Prepared for so long, it's time to change the sky of Star River Sect!" Ye Han whispered, his eyes glowing with intensity. He didn't care about Ye Hong's group being arrested.

Time slowly passed, and Luo Tian stayed in Star River Sect. Nan Gong Yuqing's group was sent by Ye Wudao to a remote faction of Star River Sect.

Though it was called sending, everyone knew it was effectively an appointment to a position of power. Though still under Star River Sect's control, the distance made it hard for others to interfere.

Luo Tian's name gradually faded. Luo Tian had been more low-key these days, and the Washing Star Pool's opening attracted people's attention.

"I'll definitely get a good cultivation method this time!"

"I also need a lower-grade immortal artifact as a weapon!" Star River Sect's Ye family members all sharpened their knives.

"Master Liangchen, the final barrier. Once your blood is on it, you can obtain the Celestial Pole Star!" In the hall, Ye Wudao addressed Ye Liangchen and Luo Tian.

As the future master, Ye Wudao's son, Ye Liangchen naturally had many shortcuts.

"These bastards changed the rules. No weapons allowed inside. Tiān'er, be careful; their target is you!"

"Remember, once the Washing Star Pool opens, even we need a minute to force it open. So even if there's danger, you must hold for a minute!" Ye Wudao's eyes showed seriousness as he warned Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen.

Chapter 1999: Vast Starry Sky

On Star River Sect's vast central square, numerous Ye family members stood there. Among the crowd, many youths were surrounded, these being the young prodigies of the Ye family. Their strength was formidable, though some were from branches and others from mainline.

"This Washing Star Pool's opening... who will finally gain Celestial Pole Star's approval? I heard the last one was Master Ye!"

"You don't know that, do you? Though this Washing Star Pool says anyone can compete for Celestial Pole Star, no one doesn't know it's for Star River Sect's next master. The elders definitely have methods to let Liangchen obtain the Celestial Pole Star; others getting it is basically impossible!" People whispered among themselves.

"Good morning, everyone!" The crowd parted as Ye Liangchen, with his usual arrogance, walked in with Luo Tian. He greeted everyone around him.

"Master Liangchen is a bit of a纨绔, but he treats us well!" Star River Sect disciples looked at Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen with admiration.

"Greetings to the two Dao Sons!" People bowed respectfully to Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen. Behind them were a group of纨绔 disciples.

"Senior Brother Tian, see that white-clothed one? His name is Ye Tong. His cultivation has reached half-immortal. Be careful of him!"

"Also, that one in blue is Ye Fu. His strength is also half-immortal..." Ye Liangchen continuously introduced to Luo Tian, each surrounded youth.
