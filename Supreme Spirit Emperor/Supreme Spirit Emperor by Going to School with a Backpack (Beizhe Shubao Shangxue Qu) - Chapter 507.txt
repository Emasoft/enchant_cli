After nearly half an hour, Wang Qingping could no longer endure. The immortal energy of the eight Yin Shadow Guards continuously cycled, consuming far less than Wang Qingping's initial stage of True Immortality.

"Wang Qingping, it's your own doing—daring to swallow the items of Zhongtian Commerce!" Guiyi sneered, slashing with a blade that carved a deep wound into Wang Qingping's chest. Flesh torn open, blood stained his entire body.

"Death!" Wang Qingping's face bore a look of resentment. Though he was the vice president of Zhongtian Commerce, his status within the organization was extremely low. There was only one president of Zhongtian Commerce, but countless vice presidents.

Wang Qingping's rise was nearly impossible until he stumbled upon a Buddha's Relic in the Lower Three Heavens. This relic belonged to a great power, a half-step Immortal King.

Wang Qingping knew that if he completely devoured and refined this relic, his strength would surge. Yet, the news of his acquisition reached his subordinate, who bypassed him to report it to the headquarters. The headquarters demanded it from Wang Qingping, but he refused—though the reward was substantial, compared to the relic, it felt meager.

Thus, Wang Qingping decided to flee with the relic. Luotian and others were merely a cover. Only Luotian and one of the Heavenly Immortals at peak stage held his respect.

"Xue Zang, help me hold off one person! If you let me escape this trial, I'll give you the relic!" Wang Qingping spat blood as a massive hand from the Yin Shadow Guards struck him, slamming his body against a mountain wall. The peak cracked extensively.

The others were all slain by the Yin Shadow Guards, leaving only one Heavenly Immortal at peak stage with a sunken chest, still breathing but near death.

"Good!" Luotian nodded, his eyes gleaming with joy. He had been waiting for this moment.

Luotian didn't fear Wang Qingping's betrayal; after all, Long Que was within his body. If necessary, Luotian could simply hand the relic to Long Que and let it spit out a single drop to kill Wang Qingping.

"Kid, the relic is precious—make sure you get it. But I won't help. The closer we are to the Death Desert, the more I can't reveal my presence; otherwise, it'll bring trouble. From now on, I won't intervene unless your life is in danger," Long Que's voice echoed in Luotian's mind, as if it could read his thoughts.

"Damn!" Luotian cursed, surprised that Long Que had failed at this moment. Still, he decided to help Wang Qingping.

As he spoke, Luotian took a step forward; his immortal energy roared from his dantian, transforming into blood qi that enveloped him. He rushed toward Guiyi.

"Wait!" Just as Luotian took a few steps, Diaodezhu suddenly stopped him. His black nose twitched repeatedly.

"Someone's coming—three True Immortals at the initial stage, those three from Huan Tian City!" Diaodezhu addressed Luotian, causing his heart to pause.

"Buzz..." At the same time, Luotian's vast spiritual awareness spread out. Three figures with murderous intent flew toward them at breakneck speed.

"Damn, we were tricked!" The three cursed as they flew toward Luotian's group.

"Let's check the disturbance ahead!" After sensing the commotion between Wang Qingping and the Yin Shadow Guards, they flew toward Luotian's group.

"Go!" Luotian's face darkened, no hesitation. He didn't know if the three were after him, but he couldn't risk it. Three True Immortals at initial stage meant certain death.

"Buzz..." Luotian's feet emitted a ripple; without even glancing at Wang Qingping, he flew southward.

"Xue Zang!" Wang Qingping roared. Luotian had previously agreed to help, which made him hopeful—killing so many people must mean he was skilled. Yet Xue Zang had fled outright.

"I'll fight to the death!" Wang Qingping's eyes flashed madness. The Yin Shadow Guards had no escape, and neither did he.

"Buzz..." A sky-shaking pressure arose. Wang Qingping clasped his hands, hair falling instantly. A radiant aura rose behind him, giving him an ethereal presence. Even the Yin Shadow Guards' attacks slowed.

Faintly, the Yin Shadow Guards hesitated, gazing at Wang Qingping. At that moment, he turned abruptly, and with a thunderous roar, the towering mountain wall shattered into dust.

"Puke..." The Yin Shadow Guards coughed up blood, their eyes clearing with disbelief.

"Buzz..." The hum echoed again as Wang Qingping's face softened, then he struck a palm that pressed the heavens and earth. The golden hand, radiating overwhelming pressure, descended upon the Yin Shadow Guards.

The golden hand, with visible patterns, seemed to dominate all existence.

"Crack..." Before the golden hand arrived, the earth cracked. The Yin Shadow Guards' masks also split.

"Boom!" A thunderous sound echoed as the golden hand imprint appeared on the ground, dust swirling and the sky exploding.

"What's going on?" At the same time, the three True Immortals at initial stage who had guarded the city gate arrived on the battlefield. Their faces bore shock as they gazed at the ruined mountain terrain.

"Wang Qingping! The former vice president of Zhongtian Commerce!" They soon spotted Wang Qingping, pale and fleeing as a white light.

Chapter 1952: The Sand Sea King City ()

"He's with that man. Chase him!" The three exchanged glances and pursued Wang Qingping.

"Cough cough..." As the three vanished, eight Yin Shadow Guards rose from the dust, their forms battered. Their faces revealed men in their thirties or forties.

"He must have paid a heavy price with that attack. If we catch him, this mission is complete," Guiyi spoke solemnly, exhaling green mist to form a mask over his face.

"Chase! If we don't catch him, we die!" The other Yin Shadow Guards also bore madness, their green masks covering their faces as they took flight toward Wang Qingping.

At that moment, Luotian was on his way to the Sand Sea King City. What puzzled him was that after he left, no one had pursued him.

"Did their target really lie with Wang Qingping instead of me?" Luotian was bewildered. He decided not to dwell on it, his body transforming into a streak of light as he pushed himself toward the Sand Sea King City.

"Murderer of Chang Ziyang and Lang Xiu! He's heading to the Sand Sea King City!" On another front, a message spread rapidly. A host of cultivators converged toward the Sand Sea King City.

"The Sand Sea King City, Shen Suanzi said that the murderer of Lang Xiu and Chang Ziyang was merely a Heavenly Immortal at the middle stage. There must have been strong help nearby. We should go to the Sand Sea King City—perhaps we can intercept him!" Voices echoed.

The entire Middle Three Heavens knew that person intended to flee to the Sand Sea King City. Chang Ziyang and Huang Youshan's elders had jointly declared that capturing the beast would earn a generous reward.

"Damn!" Luotian's face darkened as he saw people surrounding him. They mistook his blood qi for the murderer.

"Shen Suanzi, don't let me see you! If I do, I'll break your fingers and make you call me dad!" Luotian cursed inwardly. This was his seventh ambush.

"It seems I need a new face," Luotian mused, transforming into a crimson eagle and charging toward the group.

An hour later, Luotian smiled as he adopted a cold-faced middle-aged man's appearance. Yet Chen Zhanbiao remained his bulky form.

Changing his look indeed reduced trouble. After flying for half a month, Luotian finally reached the destination: the Sand Sea King City.

Yellow sand filled the sky and earth, with winds rustling Luotian's robes. In the hazy sandstorms, a hundred-foot-high wall appeared in his vision.

The wall's thickness and length were indistinct, the entire world filled with yellow sand. Amidst the swirling dust, a few travelers struggled forward, their faces obscured by wind and sand. Even Luotian's vision couldn't discern their features.

"A natural suppression! No matter one's cultivation, they can't escape the sandstorms!" Luotian mused. He hadn't expected the Death Desert to be so powerful—this was just the outer edge. If he entered deeper, it would be terrifying.

Luotian walked with difficulty; each step was arduous.

"Something's wrong. This place is uninhabitable! Even with my cultivation, walking here is exhausting. How can a Heavenly Immortal at the initial stage survive?" Luotian felt something amiss.

"A sandstorm is coming! Hurry and enter the city!" A voice echoed in Luotian's mind, laced with fear.

"Sandstorm!" Upon hearing this, Luotian's body trembled. He had done some research before and knew sandstorms were a natural phenomenon of the Death Desert. Once they swept through, no life could escape.

"I swear, the Sand Sea King City couldn't be this way—something must have happened. I didn't expect to catch a sandstorm right upon arrival!"

Thinking this, Luotian shivered. He hadn't expected the Sand Sea King City to also experience sandstorms.

"Buzz..." Luotian could only push himself toward the endless wall, knowing it must have a way to withstand.

"Shua shua shua..." Luotian and Chen Zhanbiao exerted their strength, braving the winds that could even blow away Heavenly Immortals at initial and middle stages. They reached the towering city gate.

"One hour until the barrier opens. No one should be left outside!" A stern voice echoed through the violent winds, though the storm's roar was loud, Luotian could still clearly hear it.

"City dwellers must not cause trouble!" As Luotian stepped through the gate, a cold voice echoed behind him.

"Ah..." Entering the sand city, the wind and dust lessened, allowing Luotian to breathe more easily.

Yet his face soon bore shock as he gazed at the Sand Sea King City.

His vision revealed buildings, all constructed from sand, giving him a sense of entering a world of sand.

"Comrade, is this your first time in the Sand Sea King City?" As Luotian marveled, a middle-aged man approached him with a warm smile.

"Ah, yes! Thank you for your help earlier; otherwise, I might still be outside the city!" Luotian smiled at the man.

The middle-aged man's appearance was ordinary, a common face, yet he gave Luotian an odd feeling. He couldn't immediately pinpoint what was different.

The man's cultivation level was also a Heavenly Immortal at the middle stage, decent strength. Yet Luotian sensed a hint of loneliness in his eyes.

"He's disguised. If my guess is right, he must be wearing something on his face!" Diaodezhu's expression turned serious as he transmitted to Luotian.

"Huh?" Upon hearing Diaodezhu's words, Luotian's eyes flickered slightly. He then opened his purple eyes, gazing at the middle-aged man.

"Ah! Your skills are quite strong!" Luotian smiled inwardly, then his purple eyes returned to normal. His action was so swift that the middle-aged man didn't notice.

"Ha, no problem. Even if you don't know, your speed would have let you rush in!" The middle-aged man spoke lightly.

"Comrade, may I ask your name? I've just arrived at the Sand Sea King City and don't know anyone..." Luotian inquired.

"Comrade may call me Ran Hao. If you have any matters, feel free to ask. I, Ran Hao, can know some things!" Luotian and the man, both disguised, began casual conversation.

"Time's up!" As time passed, with Luotian and Ran Hao becoming familiar, a stern voice echoed in people's ears. The city dwellers bore relief.

"Buzz..." Waves rose, golden light flying from all directions. The golden barrier enclosed the seemingly endless Sand Sea King City, instantly calming it. The surrounding winds and sand vanished, restoring peace.

"Ugh... ugh..." Yet outside the barrier, fierce winds howled, transmitting through the barrier into people's ears.

"It has begun!" As the barrier formed, Ran Hao spoke softly, gazing at the outside.

"Zhi zhi..." A piercing sound echoed above Luotian's head, as if blades continuously cut the barrier. The world darkened, and the sky was no longer sand but a black storm swirling outside.

"True Immortals below cannot survive the sandstorm!" Ran Hao explained to Luotian, his voice laced with reverence.

"Thank you, Ran Brother. May I invite you for a drink? Please introduce me to the Sand Sea King City and the Death Desert's conditions," Luotian addressed Ran Hao.

"Of course!" Ran Hao's eyes brightened, nodding as he led Luotian into the sand-built city.

"Xue Brother, what are you doing here in the Sand Sea King City? Are you seeking opportunities within the Death Desert?" Ran Hao led Luotian and Chen Zhanbiao to a small teahouse, asking.

"Yes," Luotian nodded without further explanation; he still didn't fully trust Ran Hao, as they had just met.

"Comrade, I advise you to return. Cultivate diligently; one day, you'll rise. Many in the Sand Sea King City come seeking opportunities, but most die within the Death Desert. I advise you, if there's no necessity, return," Ran Hao sighed softly, his eyes filled with sorrow.

"I really wish I could go back!" Luotian mused inwardly but smiled, shaking his head.

"Hey, isn't that Ran Hao?" As Luotian and Ran Hao conversed, a playful voice echoed in their ears. Ran Hao's face slightly changed.

"Still doing this? I told you not to do business here in the Northern City. Didn't you understand?" Three youths approached Luotian and Ran Hao, gazing at Ran Hao and Luotian.

"Comrade, if you're looking for a guide, don't choose this one. Our Sand Association is the largest in the Northern City. Prices are fair, no deception. This Ran Hao is a failure."

"Jiao San, you..." Upon hearing the youth's words, Ran Hao's face turned red. Yet he stood up and walked toward the teahouse entrance.

Luotian remained seated, silent. Ran Hao was a Heavenly Immortal at the late stage, while Jiao San was a middle-stage. Luotian couldn't fathom why Ran Hao avoided Jiao San.

Chapter 1954: Entering the Death Desert ()

Morning mist rose in the vast Sand Sea King City, adding a touch of coolness to the arid desert. Yet this relief was fleeting; within an hour, the sun began baking the earth.

The Sand Sea King City gradually buzzed with activity as figures rushed out, entering the endless desert to seek their opportunities.

"Xue Brother, let's go. After a sandstorm, there are usually treasures. While we search for your destination, we can also look for a few items," Ran Hao stood at Luotian's door, addressing him.

"Good!" Luotian nodded. He also received a storage ring and a backpack from Ran Hao. Though these items were worthless elsewhere, Luotian knew they might be crucial in the desert, possibly yielding unexpected results.

After checking that nothing was missing, Luotian and Ran Hao set off toward the Southern Gate. Chen Zhanbiao was left at Ran Hao's home; it wasn't that Luotian didn't want to bring him, but the Death Desert was too dangerous. He couldn't risk it.

Besides the Northern Gate, all four gates opened into the desert.

Not long after, they reached the Southern Gate, bustling with people. Groups of travelers exited the city, some hiring guides like Luotian.

"Jiao San!" Luotian spotted Jiao San from yesterday's trouble, now accompanied by a youth. The youth smiled as he stepped out of the city gate, while Jiao San spoke animatedly.

"Wait a moment," Luotian whispered, halting his steps to let Jiao San's group depart.

"Ah!" Ran Hao showed gratitude, nodding as they stood still, waiting for Jiao San's group to leave.

However, Jiao San noticed Luotian and Ran Hao as well. His eyes flickered with mockery before he led the youth out of the gate without proceeding further.

"Let's go," Luotian whispered, shaking his head. A mere Heavenly Immortal at the middle stage dared to trouble a late-stage one—Jiao San's mind must be addled.

"Ah!" Ran Hao nodded, understanding he couldn't avoid it. He felt touched by Luotian's words the day before.

"The youth is Zhao Chenglong, the eldest son of the Eastern City's Zhao family. His strength should be similar to yours; he recently ascended to the Heavenly Immortal peak," Ran Hao explained to Luotian as they joined the sparse crowd at the towering city gate.

"Hey, isn't it Ran Hao?" Indeed, as they reached the gate, Jiao San's grating voice echoed in their ears.

Yet Luotian and Ran Hao ignored Jiao San, directly heading out of the gate.

"Ran Hao! I called you; didn't you hear? Stop!" Jiao San saw Luotian and Ran Hao ignoring him, instantly furious.

Yet they still ignored him, which enraged Jiao San to the core.

"Comrade, he's the one who was with Jiaolu!" Jiao San hurriedly informed the youth beside him.

"Ah?" Upon hearing Jiao San's words, Zhao Chenglong's face slightly changed. He then moved swiftly to stand before Luotian and Ran Hao.

"Kneel down and greet me!" Zhao Chenglong coldly ordered Ran Hao, his voice laced with disdain.

"This..." Upon hearing Zhao Chenglong's demand, Ran Hao's face slightly changed. Anyone hearing it would be furious.

"My words didn't reach you?" Zhao Chenglong saw the anger in Ran Hao's eyes, his own eyes flashing coldness.

"Ran Hao, you don't know yet? In a month, Zhao Chenglong will marry my daughter Jiaolu!"

"You still dare to stay in the Sand City? If I were you, I'd leave the Sand City. Think about your status—how can a servant dare to dream of swan meat?" Jiao San spoke loudly, his voice laced with contempt.

"What!" Upon hearing Jiao San's words, Ran Hao's face turned pale instantly. His eyes reddened, his chest heaving violently; a streak of blood flowed from Jiao San's mouth.

"Ah..." Luotian sighed deeply, gazing at Ran Hao. Yet he thought of his own past.

At that time, himself and Chen Yuting were similar to Ran Hao. Later, Chen Yuting sacrificed herself in Feiyun Sect to protect her life.

Yet later, Luotian was glad he discovered Chen Yuting's truth. As for Ran Hao, he didn't know if Jiaolu had changed her mind or was like Chen Yuting, wanting to protect Ran Hao.

"Zhi zhi..." Ran Hao clenched his fists; his eyes, bloodshot and reddening, trembled violently. He was on the verge of losing control.

"Ha! Are you angry? Frustrated? What can you do? Just a servant! Not killing you is already mercy. Yet you still dare to approach, lingering in the Sand Sea King City!" Jiao San saw Ran Hao's state and became even more delighted, continuing to speak.

"Smack!" Luotian could no longer bear it; he swung his hand, slapping Jiao San's face. Jiao San was sent flying backward, spitting blood and his face swollen. His teeth were also broken.

This slap was so sudden that Jiao San hadn't expected it, nor had Zhao Chenglong. When Zhao Chenglong reacted, Jiao San was already flying backward.

This slap also brought Ran Hao, who had been about to go mad, back to clarity. His eyes bore disbelief as he gazed at Luotian.

"You dare!" Zhao Chenglong's face turned even colder, his aura suddenly bursting out, coldness spreading around. The heat of the city gate dropped slightly.

"I hate flies; I usually slap them to death. This fly wasn't killed, but it's due to the Jiao family's favor!" Luotian raised his eyes, his blood qi surging. The bloody atmosphere immediately suppressed Zhao Chenglong's aura.

"Xue Brother, you!" Ran Hao was slightly stunned; he hadn't expected Luotian to be so bold in the Sand Sea King City, striking a Jiao family member.

Zhao Chenglong also changed slightly; Luotian's boldness made him wary. The Sand Sea King City had been a mix of various forces these days. Zhao family's patriarch had ordered their disciples to be low-key; too much showiness might offend a major sect's disciple.

"Let's go! Things may not be as bad as you think. Let's return and find out; perhaps there's a misunderstanding," Luotian spoke softly, ignoring the fallen Jiao San and stepping out of the city gate.

"Stop!" Seeing Luotian's disregard, Zhao Chenglong roared, but his body froze instantly.

"Go..." Luotian's aura suddenly surged, releasing a True Immortal middle-stage presence. This made Zhao Chenglong fear.

"How could it be? A True Immortal middle-stage!"

"This person must be a senior of some sect, and one of the top thirty in the sect!" Zhao Chenglong felt fear. A True Immortal middle-stage was a top-tier individual in the Middle Three Heavens, sought after by major sects.

Such a person was even avoided by the four great families of the Sand Sea King City; who knew what power they represented.

"Damn it, you're a True Immortal middle-stage but act like an ass in front of me, a Heavenly Immortal middle-stage!" Jiao San, who had just stood up, cursed inwardly. He hadn't expected Ran Hao to have such a tough ally.

"Senior..." Ran Hao was also stunned, looking at Luotian. He hadn't expected Xue Zang to be a True Immortal middle-stage.

"Let's go!" Luotian spoke softly, and Zhao Chenglong no longer dared to scold. Luotian led Ran Hao out of the Sand Sea King City.

As they exited the gate and moved beyond Zhao Chenglong's line of sight, Luotian's oppressive aura vanished instantly. The immense pressure disappeared as well.

"Ha! How was my 'acting' technique? It's still effective!" Diaodezhu perched on Luotian's shoulder, his black eyes gleaming with satisfaction.

"Fair enough, but you should imitate an Immortal King's aura. Then we could walk around freely. However, if discovered, they'd kill us alive!" Luotian smiled slightly, then gazed at the endless desert.

Ran Hao listened to Luotian and Diaodezhu's conversation, his mouth twitching. He hadn't expected Luotian to have faked it.

"Now it's your turn!" Luotian addressed Ran Hao, bringing him back to his senses. He suppressed his sorrow and became resolute; he knew in the Death Desert, one mustn't be distracted. If so, it could lead to irreversible consequences.

"Let's go!" Ran Hao spoke softly and walked ahead of Luotian into the desert.

"Good!" Luotian nodded; merely Ran Hao's performance had convinced him that his future achievements would be remarkable.

The three didn't fly; those who had entered the Death Desert knew that flying above it was akin to seeking death. Flying consumed immense immortal energy, beyond what a Heavenly Immortal could endure. Luotian had also tried flying; the higher he went, the more energy he consumed, as if burning it.

"Senior Long Que, where is your Fire Cloud Sword?" Luotian communicated with Long Que; he couldn't wander aimlessly in the Death Desert without a goal.

Chapter 1955: Insult ()

Vast desert, scorching sun. Two figures walked through the endless sands, terrifying heat causing Ran Hao to sweat and pant heavily.

"Xue Brother, our destination is the desert's center. I've never ventured this far before. But don't worry, I'll do my best to take you there. If we're careful, it should be fine," Ran Hao addressed Luotian.

They had entered the desert for half a day and could no longer see the Sand Sea King City. All around was golden sand, blindingly bright.

Luotian also felt the heat beneath his feet; this temperature was unbearable for ordinary people. The sand's heat was also high, requiring constant use of immortal energy to protect his feet; otherwise, walking for a while would result in injury.

"These people are really addicted to this environment! They come here despite such harsh conditions!" Diaodezhu licked his lips, panting heavily.

"They seek strength; only by being strong can one stand firm in the immortal world and live better within sects," Luotian replied. Then he sensed a disturbance in the sky.

"Buzz..." The hum echoed, and next moment, a streak of light fell from the sky. It landed in Luotian's line of sight.

"Pu..." A golden sword was embedded into the ground, causing Luotian's face to slightly change.

He took a step forward and pulled the sword from the sand, surprised it had appeared without anyone commanding it.

"Low-grade immortal artifact!" Ran Hao's face showed a hint of joy, smiling as he explained to Luotian.

"Sandstorms are powerful; they can lift vast deserts, and beneath the sand lie treasures. Sandstorms bring these treasures to the sky, which then fall after the storm. This is why people choose to enter the Death Desert after a sandstorm."

"Moreover, since the storm has just passed, entering now is relatively safe," Ran Hao spoke softly, his eyes filled with admiration.

"It's indeed a good place, but how many people actually survive this Death Desert?" Luotian shook his head slightly and stored the sword.

As Luotian and Ran Hao walked through the Death Desert, a silhouette in black robes appeared outside the Sand Sea King City. Her face was obscured by a veil, and an icy aura radiated from her body, making people nearby dare not approach.

If Luotian were here, he would recognize this woman—Gu Qianxue, who had parted ways with him in the End Times Forest.

Yet now, Gu Qianxue's black robe had dried bloodstains, and her aura was somewhat unstable.

Her black eyes gazed at the endless desert, determination in her gaze. Then she rushed into the Death Desert.

"This person—why is she running so fast?" The black silhouette passed a rotund figure, who smiled all the while.

"Never mind who she is; I heard this Death Desert is full of treasures. This time, we should make a fortune!" A thin man stood beside the rotund figure, his eyes darting with greed.

"Damn it, you've been gone so long; why are you so greedy?" The rotund man cursed, his voice laced with excitement.

"Rubbish! If you don't pick up what's left, it's a loss. Who said that?" The thin man retorted loudly, gazing at the endless desert as if it were a treasure.

"That's true; this time, our reunion after thousands of years mustn't fail!" The rotund man warned.

"Rest assured, damn it! We now have support; who dares to trouble us in the Death Desert? God, if he's there, we'll kill him. Buddha, if he's there, we'll kill him!" The thin man spoke loudly, his voice filled with霸气.

"Unexpectedly, I Sun Kainian have reached this point! Ha! If Luotian and the others knew my current status, they'd be shocked!" The rotund man laughed heartily.

This rotund man was Sun Kainian, and the thin one was his long-sought partner Sima Tu. They were a tomb raider and a thief, now reunited.

Previously, Sun Kainian had separated from Luotian in the Lower Three Heavens. Bored, he disguised himself and entered the Middle Three Heavens. In the Middle Three Heavens, Sun Kainian thrived. During a tomb raid, he met Sima Tu.

They were overjoyed; they hadn't expected to meet in the Middle Three Heavens. After learning Sima Tu's background, Sun Kainian was enlightened.

It turned out that after being chased by the two, Sima Tu had no choice but to enter a divine beast cave. He entered deep into the cave and discovered a spatial node. Upon touching the restriction, he accidentally entered it, arriving in the immortal world.

Sima Tu's entry into the immortal world was smooth; soon, he found the sect of his and Sun Kainian's origin—Tomb Stealing Sect. In the immortal world, it was called the God-Stealing Sect.

The founder of the God-Stealing Sect was none other than their ancestor, the Tomb Stealing Master.

Originally, the God-Stealing Sect had only Sun Kainian and Sima Tu. Now that they found their sect, they expected a strong force. Yet who knew it had "grown" to three people.

But the Tomb Stealing Master was no ordinary figure; though he was one person, his strength was far behind other sects. Yet he was renowned. As the saying goes, "Don't fear thieves; fear being noticed."

"Buzz..." As Sun Kainian boasted, a buzz echoed in the sky. A black cloud suddenly covered their heads, and immense pressure made them pause slightly.

"Gui Ji, Gu Qianxue didn't expect you to be here!" A cold voice echoed from the black cloud, its tone neither warm nor cold.

After speaking, the black cloud flew toward the Death Desert to chase Gu Qianxue.

"Damn it! Who's so arrogant to speak above my head!" Sun Kainian glared at the black cloud, cursing.

"Gu Qianxue? Why do I feel so familiar with this name? Isn't she Luotian's wife?" The thin man looked puzzled, whispering.

"Gu Qianxue! Yes, that's Luotian's wife! She's being chased; if Luotian knew I watched her be hunted without helping, he'd skin me alive!" Sun Kainian jumped up, his short legs flailing as he chased the black cloud.

"Move aside!" As Sun Kainian and Sima Tu took a step, a white light flew behind them. Sandstorms swirled.

The white light flashed and passed before Sun Kainian and Sima Tu, nearly colliding with them. If they hadn't reacted quickly, they would have been knocked over.

"Damn it! A True Immortal middle-stage is so arrogant! Believe me, I'll dig up your ancestors' graves!" Sun Kainian was still shaken.

"Can you stop showing off? If you stay, I'll beat your ass!" Sima Tu also cursed, feeling he had bad luck today.

"Move aside!" Before Sima Tu's words finished, a thunderous sound erupted as three figures rushed out, shouting at Sun Kainian and Sima Tu.

"Boom!" This time more direct; the overwhelming aura sent Sun Kainian and Sima Tu flying, landing on the sand in a messy heap.

Three figures with powerful auras strode away—three True Immortals at the initial stage who had guarded Huan Tian City.
