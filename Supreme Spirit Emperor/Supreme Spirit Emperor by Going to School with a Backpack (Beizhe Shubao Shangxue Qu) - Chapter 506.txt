Luo Tian ignored the people and paid the gatekeeper the island entry fee before entering Huan Tian Island. He then found a small tavern, ordered some dishes at random, extended his spiritual awareness outward to listen to the conversations of those around him.

However, the topics of conversation among the people in Huan Tian Island were all about the "Struggle for Heaven" War. Zang Yunfei and his companions had already announced the date of the Struggle for Heaven.

"I think this time, the alliance of the three major sects should be almost successful. After all, it's been years since they've managed to succeed!"

"Perhaps not. Though the three major sects are strong, with three late-stage True Immortals, Gu Yuan Sect is no pushover. Though its power has declined significantly, even a dead camel is bigger than a horse. Moreover, Gu Yuan Sect is fighting with their backs to the wall and will surely be utterly desperate!" The people whispered among themselves. Luo Tian did not hear the information he sought and then left.

Strolling along the streets of Huan Tian Island, the entire island appeared unusually peaceful, prompting Luo Tian to sigh.

"Xue Zang, do you like this environment?" Luo Tian let out a long sigh. He truly missed his family and friends, it had been so long since he last saw his wife.

"Fair enough. As long as I'm with my elder brother, and there's a fight to be had and enough food to eat, that's all I need!" Chen Zhanbiao chuckled.

"I miss my grandfather too. I wonder how the monkey is doing, and Old Gu, Uncle Dongbo!" Diao Dedu was also affected by Luo Tian's mood and spoke softly.

"One day, we'll be untouchable, like the Nine Immortal Mountains and the former Nine Domains' Tianyuan Continent!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with determination as he stepped into a market.

The market was bustling, figures seated there scrutinizing the people around them and those entering or exiting.

"Comrade, give me a map of the Middle Heaven's Three Days—make it as comprehensive as possible!" Luo Tian, his body radiating blood qi, addressed the shopkeeper.

At the moment Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao entered, they immediately drew attention. Luo Tian's aura was oppressive, while Chen Zhanbiao's imposing physique and fierce presence made them seem like men stained with blood. Especially the dried blood on Luo Tian's body, which could not help but draw people's gazes.

"Understood!" The shopkeeper's body trembled slightly, casting a glance at Luo Tian before turning back and handing him a jade slip.

"Two million immortal stones!" The shopkeeper spoke softly, his gaze on Luo Tian. Though Luo Tian's aura was formidable, if he tried to skip payment, the shopkeeper would not hesitate to call for help.

"Boom..." A storage pouch was tossed onto the table. Over the past month, Luo Tian had eliminated countless mountain bandits; his storage rings were filled with piles of pouches.

The shopkeeper took the bloodstained storage pouch, his face breaking into a smile as he counted it and then sat back down.

Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao found a corner to sit, opening the jade slip. The content of the slip appeared in Luo Tian's mind.

Luo Tian had only visited the Middle Heaven's Three Days once, accompanying Xuan Dan. This time was with Chen Zhanbiao, and he needed to fully understand the Middle Heaven's Three Days.

"It's quite comprehensive!" A vast map appeared in Luo Tian's mind, marked with a hundred special sects. This made Luo Tian's heart tighten.

These one hundred sects formed the entire Middle Heaven's Three Days. There were no commoners, only cultivators. The sects often clashed and vied for dominance.

Huan Tian Island had also roughly ranked these one hundred sects, though it wasn't entirely accurate, it was close enough to give a general idea.

"Xinghe Prefecture is ranked fourth, no wonder Liangchen's brother was so arrogant!" Luo Tian quickly found Xinghe Prefecture and its ranking, a smile appearing on his face.

"Death Desert!" He continued searching until he found the location of the Death Desert, marked by an obvious yellow skull.

"The Death Desert is a dangerous place in the Middle Heaven's Three Days. Endless yellow sand, sandstorms, and natural mazes. Once you enter, it's hard to escape! Even True Immortals find it extremely difficult to leave, let alone the beasts and unknown dangers within!" A string of descriptions appeared in Luo Tian's mind, causing him to draw a sharp breath.

"This is like playing with me! With my current strength, entering the Death Desert would be suicide!" Luo Tian had only read the description and already felt like turning back. It was too dangerous, beyond his current capacity to enter.

"Don't worry, kid. I'm here, right? I'm familiar with the Death Desert. Just trust me!" Long Que's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Something's off!" Hearing Long Que's words, Luo Tian felt a sudden tension. Long Que had never been so eager to help him before; this time he was unusually proactive, making Luo Tian feel something was wrong.

"Master, maybe it's better to wait until I reach True Immortal status before going," Luo Tian shook his head gently, deciding it was better to return to Shenglong Sect. After all, risking his life for a superior-grade immortal weapon was not worth it.

Superior-grade immortal weapons were precious, and according to Luo Tian's knowledge, Shenglong Sect had only three. The previous three major sects each had one. But Luo Tian didn't care; nothing was more important than his life.

"Kid, why the sudden change of heart?" Hearing Luo Tian's reluctance, Long Que's voice shifted slightly.

"Nothing, I just don't feel like going anymore. My body is really exhausted!" Luo Tian spoke softly in a mental transmission, his eyes revealing a hint of amusement. He wanted to see what Long Que was up to.

"Fine, kid. I'll do you a favor. I need to enter the Death Desert and find something. Due to certain reasons, I can't leave your beast-riding seal or reveal my aura. I can only stay out for a minute, so that's why I lowered my aura in the beast arena and used the beasts' aura to hide myself." Long Que spoke solemnly, his voice carrying a sense of urgency.

"Master, to be honest, you've done me a favor before. According to the rules, I should help you. But I value my life very much. You know how weak I am now. Your level is way beyond mine!" Luo Tian shook his head.

"Kid, I said I'll be there to protect you. If any danger is beyond your control, I'll personally intervene! How about that?" Long Que spoke again, his voice filled with urgency.

"Master, tell me what it is!" Luo Tian spoke softly; he needed to know why Long Que was doing this and whether it was worth his effort.

"Fine, I'm after my weapon—Huoyun Sword!" Long Que spoke softly, his voice heavy with desperation.

"Back when I fought a primordial beast, we both suffered injuries. My Huoyun Sword fell into the Death Desert. Do you know why the Death Desert is called a dangerous place? Because of my Huoyun Sword. The sword's blade fell there!"

"The extreme temperatures caused the Death Desert to expand several times over, hence it became a true dangerous place!" Long Que spoke softly, but his words made Luo Tian's face change drastically.

"If I can find the blade of Huoyun Sword, I can quickly recover some strength!" Long Que spoke solemnly.

"Master, if you regain your strength, what level will you reach?"

"If I help you, can you do me a favor in return?" Luo Tian asked. If Long Que was willing to fully assist him once, it wasn't a big deal to gamble.

"Probably early-stage Immortal King! I can help you once!" Long Que replied, and Luo Tian's face broke into a smile.

"Good, I'll take the gamble. But Master Long Que, be sure to intervene when it's critical! Don't let me die!" Luo Tian nodded in agreement.

"Brother, are you planning to enter the Middle Heaven's Three Days?" Just as Luo Tian and Long Que finished their conversation, a man with a smile approached Luo Tian.

"Yes!" Luo Tian nodded, his brow furrowed slightly. Though Huan Tian Island was peaceful, good people were rare. Unless avoiding enemies, who would come to Huan Tian Island for no reason?

"Brother, don't misunderstand. Let me introduce myself first. I'm Wang Qingping, the vice-chairman of the Central Heaven Commercial Guild. I'll also be entering the Middle Heaven's Three Days tomorrow to transport supplies to Haisha Sect. Brother, would you like to travel with us?" The man smiled and introduced himself first.

Luo Tian stood up without acknowledging the man, understanding his intention immediately. The man wanted him and Chen Zhanbiao to accompany them for protection, then offer some payment.

Luo Tian didn't care about the payment and had no time to waste, as it would take him a month and a half, nearly two months, to travel from Huan Tian City to the Death Desert. He couldn't afford the time and didn't know how long he'd need to stay in the Death Desert. He also needed to return for the Struggle for Heaven.

"Wait!" As Luo Tian was about to step out of the main gate, a man blocked his path. His eyes carried an aggressive look. Though called a "big man," he was still inferior to Chen Zhanbiao, with his strength at late-stage Heavenly Immortal. In Huan Tian Island, this was considered quite good.

"Friend, leave your name so we know why you're so arrogant and disregard the Central Heaven Commercial Guild!" The man shouted, having been hired by the guild to escort supplies. Seeing the vice-chairman trying to recruit Luo Tian, he was quite upset.

"Go away..." Luo Tian immediately recognized the man's intention and dismissed it, letting out a cold snort before continuing toward the market.

"Kid, being so arrogant isn't good!" The man's face twisted with a sneer as he reached out to slap Luo Tian's shoulder. To others, it seemed like two old friends meeting.

Chapter 1949: Divine Calculator ()

"Brother, I told you to go away!" Before the man's hand could land, Chen Zhanbiao behind Luo Tian roared and shouted. Like a pillar of stone, his massive foot kicked the man's stomach.

Chen Zhanbiao's kick could not be withstood by ordinary people; even a late-stage Heavenly Immortal couldn't endure it. The man's body collided with the market door, falling onto the street and rolling over, spitting blood continuously.

The crowd gasped in shock, their faces filled with amazement as they gazed at Chen Zhanbiao and Luo Tian. They hadn't expected these two masters to be so fierce.

"Doesn't the island know its rules?" People whispered among themselves, surprised that these two masters had openly caused trouble.

"This is the cost of damaging the gate!" Luo Tian's face still bore a cold smile as he waved his hand, dropping a storage pouch onto the shopkeeper's table before walking toward the street as if nothing had happened.

"Good!" The shopkeeper hadn't expected Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao to act so boldly, but he still took the pouch. Though the market belonged to Huan Tian Island, these matters were not his concern; others would handle it.

Not long after, a group of people approached. The leader was a middle-aged man with a tall build and an imposing gaze, his cultivation at early-stage True Immortal.

"What's your name? Why did you cause trouble in Huan Tian Island? Don't you know the island's rules?" The man spoke solemnly.

"Xue Zang!" Luo Tian replied softly, and the surrounding people's faces changed instantly. Though they were in Huan Tian Island, they had heard of the recent events outside. Xue Zang was now a minor name in the Lower Heaven's Three Days.

"Unexpectedly, he is Xue Zang! No wonder his blood qi is so intense!" People realized and looked at Luo Tian with different eyes.

"I don't care who you are. Come with me, or it's a death sentence for causing trouble in Huan Tian Island!" The man spoke solemnly, his golden hand reaching out to grab Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian waved his hand, a streak of green light flashing from it and vanishing instantly. The surrounding people's eyes flickered, but only the man saw what was in Luo Tian's hand.

"Boom..." The golden hand exploded, turning into a gust of wind that swept over Luo Tian. The man's eyes showed respect as he spoke to Luo Tian.

"This was a misunderstanding. I hope you don't take it personally!" The man's heart pounded; he had clearly seen the token in Luo Tian's hand—Zhubu Seal of the Bu Tian Sect. Having such a token meant Luo Tian's identity was clear.

Though Huan Tian Island was strong, it belonged to the Bu Tian Sect. As a guard captain, he dared not touch someone with the Bu Tian Seal.

Today's troublemaker was anyone else, but if it were from one of the Nine Immortal Mountains, he would have dared to arrest them. But for the Bu Tian Sect, he couldn't dare.

"Ah, it's a bother!" Luo Tian spoke softly and then walked toward the teleportation array with Chen Zhanbiao.

The vice-chairman of the Central Heaven Commercial Guild had a gleam in his eyes. His mission to transport supplies was extremely important, so besides the guild's guards, he also wanted to recruit some strong people for protection.

"Alas..." Wang Qingping sighed deeply, unable to understand why even Huan Tian Island's people didn't argue with Luo Tian. Such a status, how could he care about his payment?

"Let's go then!" Wang Qingping spoke softly, and several people stood up from the market. Their bodies radiated powerful auras.

The big man who had been kicked by Chen Zhanbiao struggled to stand up, glancing at Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao with resentment before weakly following Wang Qingping's group toward the teleportation array.

After paying for the teleportation array, Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao stood on it. The teleportation energy swept over them, and they vanished from Huan Tian Island.

"Buzz..." The dizziness faded, and Luo Tian stood in the Middle Heaven's Three Days' Huan Tian City. A smile appeared on his face, though it looked unusually bloody to others.

"This is my second visit to the Middle Heaven's Three Days!" Luo Tian felt the rich spiritual energy of the Middle Heaven's Three Days, his eyes filled with longing. How much more concentrated must the spiritual energy of the Nine Immortal Mountains be?

"This is discrimination! Why am I not counted as a person? I'm even exempt from transportation. I feel insulted!" Diao Dedu, perched on Luo Tian's shoulder, shouted loudly, causing laughter from the surrounding people.

"It's fine; it saved me money!" Luo Tian smiled and ignored Diao Dedu's outbursts, looking around the city slowly.

"Did you hear? The young master of Yinyue Sect is about to marry the young master of Jinguang Sect next month!"

"One year from now, will the Lower Heaven's Three Days manage to defeat Gu Yuan Sect?" People's whispers filled Luo Tian's ears.

"Still, I think the person who killed all those sects' prodigies is more impressive. Six prodigies from different sects—Huang Youshan and Chang Ziyang, both treasures of their sects—were all wiped out by one person!"

"The person seems to have disappeared. The old masters of the three sects called for the prodigy of Tianji Sect's Heaven Calculating Mountain to predict his whereabouts. In the end, they found him in Huan Tian City!" Another piece of news that caught Luo Tian's attention.

"That's me, isn't it?" Luo Tian muttered to himself and stopped in place, watching a small stall's items while listening to the two people's conversation.

"You don't know, right? What is this 'Divine Calculator'?"

"Ah, he's a prodigy of the Tianji Sect. After multiple calculations, he predicted the person's outline."

"Now it's really hard to leave. There are four city gates, each with three early-stage True Immortals guarding them!" Hearing the people's conversation, Luo Tian's face slightly changed. He hadn't expected that these sects had still not given up on the matter after so long.

"It seems leaving might be troublesome," Diao Dedu, perched on Luo Tian's shoulder, spoke softly.

"Let's check the situation first," Luo Tian nodded and walked toward the southern gate of Huan Tian City.

Not long after, Luo Tian reached the southern gate. However, it was quite crowded. Though there were no problems inside the city, outside the city walls, three middle-aged men stood with cold expressions. They held a token and continuously scanned it over the people coming and going.

"I need to find a way out," Luo Tian muttered in his mind. The people blocking the path clearly had a method to detect killers.

"Excuse me," As Luo Tian was thinking, a wave of energy came from behind. A group of fifteen people pushed through the crowd and approached Luo Tian, making him slightly move his head.

"Xue Zang!" The fifteen people also saw Luo Tian, their faces slightly changing. These fifteen were the ones who had entered the Middle Heaven's Three Days after Luo Tian.

"Need protection for your supplies?" Luo Tian saw Wang Qingping and spoke to him, his voice still cold.

"Brother Xue Zang? You want to join?" Wang Qingping's eyes flickered with confusion before lighting up.

"Where are you going? If it's convenient, I can go with a generous payment!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze on Wang Qingping.

Wang Qingping's group of fifteen had ten early-stage Heavenly Immortals, two mid-stage, one late-stage, and one peak-stage. Such strength was nothing to Luo Tian, let alone the Middle Heaven's Three Days where strong people were everywhere.

"Shahai King City. Brother Xue Zang, don't worry about the payment; it's one million immortal stones!" Wang Qingping smiled.

"Shahai King City?" Luo Tian's brow furrowed slightly, surprised that Wang Qingping's destination was so convenient for him.

Outside the Death Desert were also sects and forces. Shahai King City was a city, but it was one of the famous forces in the Middle Heaven's Three Days. Though not as strong as Xinghe Prefecture or Huan Tian Island, it ranked in the top fifty of the hundred sects.

Shahai King City was backed by the Death Desert, so to enter it, one had to pass through Shahai King City.

Generally, dangerous places represented endless danger but also great opportunities. Many sect disciples wanted to take a risk and enter the Death Desert for chances.

Thus, Shahai King City had a mixed population with disciples from various sects doing business there. Naturally, they made money.

"This Central Heaven Commercial Guild isn't simple," Luo Tian thought but was still puzzled. The guild could do business between the Middle and Lower Heaven's Three Days, so its strength was naturally not trivial. But why didn't Wang Qingping have strong people accompanying him?

"Brother, how about it?" Wang Qingping looked at Luo Tian with hope.

"Good!" Luo Tian nodded and agreed, needing to infiltrate this group to enter the Death Desert. As for other matters, he didn't care. He had already decided that no matter what happened, his life was the priority. He felt something was off with Wang Qingping.

"Ah, he didn't even include me!" Diao Dedu cursed loudly, but as the group walked out of the city gate, they saw three early-stage True Immortals. Luo Tian's heart tightened.

Chapter 1950: The Goods Being Transported ()

Luo Tian followed the group and approached the three early-stage True Immortals. They immediately blocked him.

"Stop!" One of the early-stage True Immortals shouted at Luo Tian's group. Wang Qingping's face slightly changed, and he hurried to the three early-stage True Immortals. He smiled politely and whispered to them.

"Ah, that's better!" The three nodded in approval as they took the three storage pouches from Wang Qingping.

"The Central Heaven Commercial Guild's face must be respected. Who in the Middle Heaven's Three Days doesn't know that the Central Heaven Commercial Guild only does business and never kills? Go ahead!" One of the early-stage True Immortals spoke, waving his hand.

"Still, a normal inspection is needed to go through the process symbolically," one of the early-stage True Immortals spoke softly, scanning Luo Tian's group.

"Rest assured, three masters, we are all good people—big good people!" Wang Qingping spoke loudly. He didn't know the true nature of Luo Tian's group, but he had already spoken to them beforehand. His intention was simply to avoid Luo Tian's group being a problem for the three early-stage True Immortals.

After all, Luo Tian's group had been recruited in Huan Tian Island, a place known as a haven for criminals.

"Go on then," Wang Qingping spoke softly, leading Luo Tian's group toward the three early-stage True Immortals.

"Buzz..." The energy spread, and the three's tokens emitted a humming sound. Three purple beams of light shot out from their tokens, shining on the back of one of the men in Wang Qingping's group.

"Ugh..." When the purple light shone on the man, a groan echoed in everyone's ears. Gray patterns appeared on his arms.

"Ah, go ahead!" The three early-stage True Immortals looked at the gray patterns and showed impatience.

"One... two..." Seeing that the man was fine, others followed Wang Qingping's group and were scanned by the purple light.

Each person had some gray patterns, varying in number—some had dozens, others hundreds.

Luo Tian also followed the group and had the most gray patterns—thousands, even some changed color.

Seeing Luo Tian's dense gray patterns, Wang Qingping and the three early-stage True Immortals' faces slightly changed. Their eyes showed disbelief, but they said nothing.

"Ha ha, Brother Xue Zang, I definitely didn't misjudge you! I'll rely on you for this journey!" Wang Qingping looked at Luo Tian and became more affectionate.

Luo Tian and the fifteen people Wang Qingping had hired were all confused, following him toward the southern part of Huan Tian City.

"Vice-chairman, what exactly are those gray patterns?" As the group left Huan Tian City, they asked Wang Qingping.

"Ah, one line represents a thousand lives. So if you have one, it means you've killed a thousand people. That's what I mean!" Wang Qingping looked at Luo Tian with admiration.

"Millions!" Hearing Wang Qingping's words, the remaining fifteen people were shocked and looked at Luo Tian. They had clearly seen his thousands of gray patterns, meaning millions of lives.

"He actually killed so many people!" Everyone looked at Luo Tian's blood-stained robe, unable to imagine how he had killed so many.

After all, before merging, each of the three major sects had about two to three million disciples and elders. After merging, Shenglong Sect had no more than seven million disciples.

"Did he kill an entire sect?" Everyone's minds trembled, thinking it must have been a mistake by the three early-stage True Immortals. They couldn't believe such a person existed.

Luo Tian was also slightly startled, not expecting that they could detect this.

The group only felt shocked for a moment before continuing their journey. Throughout the trip, Luo Tian only communicated with Chen Zhanbiao, while others rarely spoke to him except Wang Qingping.

"Heretic!" At this point, Luo Tian was seen as a heretic by the group. Such a person who killed without hesitation and had no mercy, though he was strong, everyone knew heretics were unpredictable. They didn't want to be around such a person for long.

Time passed slowly, and Luo Tian didn't care, walking with the group. He had expected danger but after ten days of travel, there was no trouble at all—everything went smoothly. Not even a single person tried to steal from them.

"It's strange," Luo Tian muttered in his mind. The group reached a large mountain, and Wang Qingping's face showed slight tension but he still smiled and chatted with the group.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian was confused, a wave of energy spread from the mountain. A cold laugh echoed in everyone's ears.

"Wang Qingping, I didn't expect you to come here. Hand over the goods and leave quickly, or today is your death! Do you think these trash can help you?" As Luo Tian's group was confused, a cold voice echoed in their ears.

"Everyone be careful!" Wang Qingping's face turned pale immediately, his body shaking as he looked at the figures on the mountain peak.

"Indeed there's something fishy!" Luo Tian's eyes flickered, standing behind the group as if checking their back. But he was actually ready to run if anything went wrong.

"Those who want to live should stay away from Wang Qingping, or you'll die!" As Luo Tian's group was tense, the figures on the mountain spoke again, their voices carrying a霸道 (domineering) tone.

At the same time, the figures on the mountain flew down and appeared in front of them instantly.

"Yao Ming Eight Guards!" Seeing the eight people, Wang Qingping's face turned even graver.

The eight men wore blue robes and had no visible faces, their masks showing grotesque expressions with only emotionless eyes.

"Eight late-stage Heavenly Immortals!" The seventeen people except Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao turned pale. Eight late-stage Heavenly Immortals could easily destroy them all.

"The Central Heaven Commercial Guild is doing business. Strangers, please leave quickly!" One of the masked figures with long hair spoke loudly.

"The Central Heaven Commercial Guild! Vice-chairman Wang, aren't you part of the Central Heaven Commercial Guild? How come these people are intercepting you?" The group trembled, thinking it was just a normal transport mission. Who could have expected to meet late-stage Heavenly Immortals?

"Ha ha, Vice-chairman Wang, I was indeed the vice-chairman of the Central Heaven Commercial Guild in the Lower Heaven's Three Days. But now I'm not!" The masked man who had spoken before said again.

"What?" Hearing the masked man's words, Wang Qingping's people looked at him.

"Guiyi, let me go! I'll give you all my wealth!" Wang Qingping spoke solemnly, his face no longer showing weakness but instead a change in demeanor. His aura gradually rose.

"Daydreaming! This is your last chance. Hand over the goods and come back with us to face punishment. You might still live one more life. If you resist, today is your death!" Guiyi spoke coldly without any emotion.

"Also, if you don't want to die, run away quickly! If you continue helping him, we'll deal with you all!" The Yao Ming Eight Guards stood there, radiating a killing aura.

"Did you think you could escape? You don't think the Heaven Calculating Mountain's Divine Calculator is a decoration, do you?" Guiyi's eyes, hidden under his mask, were cold as he looked at Wang Qingping.

"Again, the Divine Calculator?" Hearing Guiyi's words, Luo Tian furrowed his brow slightly. He had heard the name Divine Calculator for the second time, and even the old masters of the three sects had consulted the Divine Calculator to find their positions.

"Wang Qingping, I'm sorry! I choose to leave. Your payment is generous, but it's not something I can earn!" Seeing the eight Yao Ming Guards, someone immediately turned back. They were only early-stage Heavenly Immortals; how could they fight late-stage ones?

After saying this, the fifteen people except Luo Tian walked away. But Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao stood there.

"Do you fear them? Or do you not fear me?" A cold voice echoed, and as the fifteen people had taken a few steps, Wang Qingping's body burst with early-stage True Immortal aura. This made the people stop their steps.

"Early-stage True Immortal!"

"I didn't expect his progress to be so fast. Hand over your soul core!" Sensing Wang Qingping's aura, the Yao Ming Eight Guards flew forward and rushed toward him.

"Stop them! Otherwise, they'll die!" Wang Qingping's gaze swept over Luo Tian's group and finally landed on Luo Tian. Among these people, he had the most confidence in Luo Tian.

"No interest!" Luo Tian shook his head gently and walked away with Chen Zhanbiao, as if he hadn't heard Wang Qingping's words.

Luo Tian had no guilt for leaving since Wang Qingping had deceived them first. However, he didn't go far and stood nearby, watching Wang Qingping and the Yao Ming Eight Guards. He had some interest in what the Yao Ming Guards called "soul core."

Although Wang Qingping was an early-stage True Immortal, the Yao Ming Eight Guards showed no fear. Their bodies radiated a green aura, like ghosts from the underworld, and their combined strength was almost equal to that of an early-stage True Immortal. In fact, it was even stronger.

"Poof..." Next moment, a green sickle slashed through one of the early-stage Heavenly Immortals, instantly cutting him in half.

Chapter 1951: The Soul Core ()

Blood splattered, and the ten people Wang Qingping had recruited for protection were desperate. The eight Yao Ming Guards didn't care who they were, giving them no chance to survive. They attacked immediately with their green sickles and killed several early-stage Heavenly Immortals.

"Buzz..." Wang Qingping's face was also grim. He knew the Yao Ming Guards' power; if he escaped this time, they would die too. Therefore, the eight Yao Ming Guards wouldn't talk to him; it was a matter of life and death. This was the Yao Ming Guards' way—no retreat, only survival.

If they failed this time, next time it would be eight early-stage True Immortals, and that would be his true death.

"Buzz..." Wang Qingping ignored the dead ten early-stage Heavenly Immortals and flew into the air. His hands moved, and a radiant light rose from his head like a blazing sun, thundering down. He struck one of the Yao Ming Guards with a palm.

"Crack..." Eight green sickles crossed, and sharp blades of light swept through the sky. They rushed toward Wang Qingping.

"Boom..." The next moment, the blazing sun was destroyed by the green blades. Wang Qingping's body was also violently thrown back.

"Kill..." After repelling Wang Qingping, the eight Yao Ming Guards shouted again. Their green sickles turned blood-red and rushed toward Wang Qingping once more.

"This group is truly powerful; their combined attack method can suppress an early-stage True Immortal!" Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao stood there, Diao Dedu whispering softly on Luo Tian's shoulder.

"Indeed, I guess this Central Heaven Commercial Guild is also like Huan Tian Island. Otherwise, these eight Yao Ming Guards wouldn't be so strong!" Luo Tian whispered softly, his gaze on the eight people. If he faced one alone, he would definitely crush them. But if he faced all eight, the outcome was uncertain.

"Big brother, what should we do?" Chen Zhanbiao spoke gruffly, looking at the fight. His eyes showed eagerness.

"Wait a bit longer!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with a smile, but he was secretly calculating the soul core.

Luo Tian hadn't expected Wang Qingping to have a soul core. He knew the value of a soul core well.

During his stay at Shenglong Sect, he had studied the knowledge of the immortal world and read through most of the ancient texts of the three major sects.

Buddhism was a term he found somewhat unfamiliar. In the past, there had been Buddhist sects in the Nine Domains, but they were just commoners' beliefs. He hadn't expected Buddhism to exist in the immortal world and hold a high position, even ranking second after Xinghe Prefecture.

Luo Tian learned that there were many sects in the immortal world with shadows in the Nine Domains, but they were all minor sects. They weren't as powerful as those in the immortal world.

A soul core was a relic created by a late-stage True Immortal who had achieved enlightenment, compressing their entire cultivation into one soul core. This relic was like a heritage pearl.

A soul core not only contained the cultivation of a Buddhist sect's late-stage True Immortal but also their memories. Additionally, it was a powerful attack tool. It was extremely precious.

Boom boom boom...

As Luo Tian pondered, the thunderous sound of explosions echoed in his and Diao Dedu's ears.

Wang Qingping's early-stage True Immortal power fully erupted, and he conjured a series of light blades, continuously slashing against the Yao Ming Eight Guards.

"According to logic, I should help this Wang Qingping since he helped me get out of the city!" Luo Tian muttered to himself. However, he didn't want to cause trouble for himself. The Central Heaven Commercial Guild clearly had a large power, and the matter of killing Huang Youshan and others hadn't been resolved yet. If he offended the Central Heaven Commercial Guild again, he wouldn't have a good outcome.

Time passed slowly, and Wang Qingping's group was almost wiped out in just a few exchanges. Wang Qingping was an early-stage True Immortal, but this level was weak in Luo Tian's view. However, it was still an early-stage True Immortal, and the eight Yao Ming Guards faced significant pressure.
