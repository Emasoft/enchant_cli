Luo Tian intended to pat Long Jie's head habitually, but then abruptly recalled that Long Jie was now the Master of the Demon Domain and had matured into an adult. Such a gesture would be inappropriate, so he instead patted Long Jie's shoulder with a light laugh. His figure flickered as he led Long Jie and Sun Kemin into the Chaotic Continent.

Though the Chaotic Continent had been rebuilt, much of its infrastructure still required reconstruction. The land bustled with activity as people moved about in a lively manner, making it the only faction that had not sought Fu Xingyue.

"Luotian!" At the moment Luo Tian and his companions appeared in the Chaotic Continent, the entire populace stirred. Their gazes instinctively turned toward the three figures hovering in the sky.

Some eyes carried reverence, while others bore deep hatred. After the previous battle, the Demon Domain had suffered heavy casualties, with many of their loved ones annihilated under the crushing might of four factions.

Luo Tian observed the people's gazes and sighed deeply. He did not blame their resentment; if he were in their position, he too would have sought vengeance against those who had invaded the Four Sacred Star Domains.

"Luotian!" Some of the more spirited youths surrounded Luo Tian, their eyes burning with murderous intent.

"Give me back my brother's life!" A youth roared, his eyes blood-red as he lunged at Luo Tian without regard for the latter's overwhelming power.

The youth radiated a dark aura, his body pulsating with an ominous energy—evidently having unleashed a forbidden technique.

"Boom..." Luo Tian extended his hand, a pristine palm radiating overwhelming might. He slowly clenched it, and the youth dissolved into a mist of blood that vanished into the sky. The blood's energy was completely absorbed by Luo Tian.

"Whoever seeks vengeance, come to me. I, Luotian, will always be ready! I can wait for you—centuries, millennia, even eons!" Luo Tian's voice rang out with authority. His gaze swept over the crowd before he took a step forward, appearing at the entrance of the Central Chaotic Holy Palace.

On the grey mountain stood a grey palace, its exterior calm and unassuming. Zhu Ge Hun Dun and Zhu Ge Jie stood there, their expressions serene as they watched Luo Tian's group emerge into view.

"Master Luotian truly commands such power, effortlessly slaying people as if crushing an ant!" Sun Miechen remarked softly, his tone laced with admiration.

"Sun Miechen, are you the God-King?" Before Luo Tian could respond, Sun Kemin interjected.

"Indeed!" Sun Miechen shrugged, his gaze shifting to Sun Kemin with a puzzled expression. He wondered why Sun Kemin had asked such an odd question.

"Frankly, I doubt your brain could even qualify you to be the God-King of the Divine Race. This kind of clumsy provocation is obvious even to a fool! Do you think they'll fall for it?" Sun Kemin sneered, then pointed at Zhu Ge Hun Dun and others.

"Ha..." Long Jie stood beside Luo Tian, his eyes wide with admiration as he regarded Sun Kemin. Initially, Long Jie had looked down on Sun Kemin, a thief who had once coveted the Dragon Tomb of the Demon Domain. But now, Sun Kemin's words made him regard him with newfound respect—such remarks were only spoken by people like Xu Liyi and Zheng Xin.

"Sun Kemin!" Sun Miechen, of such high status, was insulted indirectly by Sun Kemin. His aura flared with indignation.

The people of the Demon Domain sneered at Sun Kemin and Sun Miechen's quarrel, as they held no fondness for either.

"You think clinging to Luo Tian's leg makes you immune?" Sun Kemin spoke coldly, his aura rising.

"Are you daring to?" Sun Kemin's eyes flashed with contempt as he subtly shifted closer to Luo Tian, his posture radiating arrogance.

"Be careful when you step out in the future," Sun Miechen said, watching Luo Tian with a smile as he exhaled deeply, issuing a threat.

"Threaten me? Ha! I never thought anyone would dare threaten me!"

"Be careful with the Divine Race's God-King's tomb in the future. Who knows when it might be pried open? Don't blame me then!"

"Ha..." The onlookers chuckled at Sun Kemin's words, gazing at the absurd figure of Sun Kemin. It was the first time they had seen someone so brazenly threaten a Divine Race God-King.

"You!" Sun Miechen's face darkened as he shook his sleeve, ignoring Sun Kemin.

"Hmph!" Sun Kemin also shook his robe, adopting an air of self-importance that even surpassed Sun Miechen's arrogance.

"Everyone, did I arrive too late?" Starlight shimmered as Zhou Wei arrived with a smile, his gaze scanning the group.

Chapter 1435: Entering the Chaotic Abyss

"What's going on?" Zhou Wei had barely landed when he sensed an unusual atmosphere. He looked at Sun Miechen's dark expression and asked Luo Tian.

"Nothing, the King of Kings treated others as fools and was exposed. He's now angry," Sun Kemin said proudly, explaining to Zhou Wei.

"Sun Kemin, did you go to the Star Luo Domain's Star Curtain and steal a pseudo-Era Treasure?" Zhou Wei narrowed his brows, turning his gaze to Sun Kemin.

"No!" Sun Kemin looked at Zhou Wei's eyes and felt embarrassed, his expression awkward as he fell silent.

Hearing Zhou Wei's words, Luo Tian was also surprised by Sun Kemin, regarding him as a godlike figure. He could not fathom what tomb Sun Kemin had dared to enter—his own ancestral tomb had been looted by the Demon Race, and now even the Star Luo Domain's grand tomb had been infiltrated.

"Little wonder he was hunted. He deserved it!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, then turned his gaze to Zhu Ge Hun Dun.

"About time. Yan Hongtao was severely injured; he probably couldn't come," Sun Miechen said, his expression impatient as he addressed Zhu Ge Hun Dun.

Hearing Sun Miechen's words, Zhu Ge Hun Dun furrowed his brows. If they didn't wait for Yan Hongtao, he might be upset. The Chaotic Domain could not afford further turmoil.

"Who said he couldn't come?" A cold voice echoed from the sky. Yan Hongtao descended with his blood pressure rising, his aura still formidable but Luo Tian's group noticed a hint of fatigue and weakness in Yan Hongtao's eyes.

"Yan Hongtao?" Sun Miechen's eyes flickered, then a smile spread across his face.

The people of the Chaotic Domain sighed in relief. Yan Hongtao's arrival was ideal for them; if he hadn't come, the resources required to open the Chaotic Abyss would have fallen on them.

"How strong was that ancient royal clan member?" Sun Miechen asked Yan Hongtao first, knowing his strength. The fact that Yan Hongtao had been wounded indicated the ancient royal clan member's formidable power.

Hearing Sun Miechen's question, everyone turned their gaze to Yan Hongtao, waiting for his response. After all, Yan Hongtao was the one who had fought that ancient royal clan member and knew his strength best.

"Very strong. At least on par with me. Without using my secret techniques, I couldn't stop him!" Yan Hongtao sighed softly and waved his hand. The scene of his battle with Fu Xingyue appeared before the onlookers.

Yan Hongtao knew that information about the ancient royal clan was crucial. The people present were all pillars of the Nine Domains; if the ancient royal clan attacked the Nine Domains, they would likely be the main force.

In the scene, a handsome youth faced Yan Hongtao. It could only be Fu Xingyue.

Fu Xingyue wielded the Star Moon Divine Spear, striking repeatedly with waves of overwhelming power. Yan Hongtao held a crimson sword, clashing against it continuously.

Their battle took place in the void. The entire space trembled under their blows, wild waves of energy swirling through the void.

Finally, Yan Hongtao plunged his sword into Fu Xingyue's heart while Fu Xingyue smashed Yan Hongtao's head with his spear. They then默契ly separated, vanishing into the void.

"Another one has grown stronger!" Luo Tian sighed in admiration, watching Fu Xingyue emerge from the void. No one knew Fu Xingyue better than him.

"Very powerful," Long Jie frowned, gazing at Fu Xingyue emerging from the void. He wasn't sure if he could subdue Fu Xingyue.

Others also looked grave. They knew Yan Hongtao's strength, and the fact that he had fought to such an extent indicated Fu Xingyue's formidable power.

"I later checked the records in Shiluo City. Based on his techniques and appearance, he must be from the Star Moon Clan of the Ancient Royal Clans," Yan Hongtao said, his tone grave.

"Search for him. Try to find him!" The group sighed deeply. They knew how difficult it would be to locate a mid-Era genius in the vast Nine Domains, especially one from an ancient royal clan.

"Everyone, I can also share another piece of news. The seal leading to the Origin Domain in the Thunder Domain has been opened!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, deciding to share this revelation with them.

"What!" Hearing Luo Tian's words, the group's faces changed abruptly. They stared at Luo Tian in shock, never expecting such a shocking revelation.

"Yes. I once entered the Thunder Sea Marsh and encountered the lingering consciousness of the former Thunder Lord. He had sealed the Thunder Sea Marsh, but the ancient royal clan from the Origin Domain hasn't entered yet. Perhaps they're not ready," Luo Tian shook his head lightly.

The onlookers' faces turned grave, their expressions deepened as they imagined the ancient royal clan emerging from the Thunder Domain. For the Nine Domains, it would be a catastrophe.

They didn't doubt Luo Tian's words. Though he had offended them many times, his deeds had proven that he wouldn't deceive them on such a major issue.

"Too fast! We Star Luo Domain had calculated that the ancient royal clan's emergence would take at least a century. But it came so quickly!" Zhou Wei sighed softly, his gaze filled with confusion.

"Regardless, prepare. Perhaps the scene of all races attacking will appear at any moment. Enhancing your strength is the key!" Sun Miechen's eyes burned with battle intent as he clenched his fists, eager to see the true strength of the ancient royal clan and whether they were as terrifying as rumored.

"Let's go. Enter the Chaotic Abyss. If there are any opportunities or blessings, maybe you'll find chances to enhance your strength!" Zhu Ge Hun Dun sighed and addressed the group before stepping into the palace.

Luo Tian's group exchanged glances, then followed Zhu Ge Hun Dun into the palace.

As soon as they entered, Luo Tian saw a starry sky. Clearly, this holy palace was like a small world.

Under the grey starry sky, Zhu Ge Hun Dun led them for an hour before they arrived at a starry space.

"This is the entrance to the Chaotic Abyss!" Zhu Ge Hun Dun pointed at the starry space, addressing Luo Tian's group.

"This? Nothing special?" Sun Kemin looked puzzled, gazing at the empty starry space and speaking softly.

"Everyone, bring out your resources!" Zhu Ge Hun Dun's eyes held a hint of amusement as he addressed Zhou Wei and Yan Hongtao.

"Okay!" The three men's faces showed pain, then they waved their hands. Golden light flew from their hands, forming three golden dragons that coiled around them.

"Is this an Yuan Qi Vein?" Luo Tian's eyes flickered, then he felt something was off. Ordinary Yuan Qi Veins were nothing to them, but after careful observation, his face changed abruptly, surprise flashing in his eyes.

Three golden dragons radiated vast Yuan Qi and were imbued with rich vitality. The three Yuan Qi Veins seemed truly alive, coiling above the group.

"An Yuan Qi Vein that has nurtured an immortal herb!" Sun Kemin's breath quickened as he flew up, his eyes filled with greed. He seemed uncontrollably drawn to one of the Yuan Qi Veins.

"Get down!" Luo Tian saw Sun Kemin's gaze and knew his habit of grabbing good things had returned. He quickly scolded him, pulling Sun Kemin back.

"Hmm." Zhu Ge Hun Dun's face showed satisfaction as he nodded, his hands moving swiftly with reverence.

"By the way, did you bring it for me?" As Zhu Ge Hun Dun prepared to open the Chaotic Abyss, Luo Tian smiled and addressed Sun Miechen.

"Once we come out of the Chaotic Abyss, I'll send it to you!" Sun Miechen glared at Sun Kemin's greed and coldly ignored Luo Tian.

"Unbelievable, the Sacred Clan really has such things!" Luo Tian was excited. He finally understood why the Chaotic Domain didn't want to pay the cost themselves or fight with him to open the Chaotic Abyss.

"Riches! Riches!" Sun Kemin thought about how Sun Miechen's group still owed them three such Yuan Qi Veins, his saliva flowing involuntarily.

"The greatest use of this is to cultivate young strong warriors!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with light, recalling how Long Jian had used Yuan Qi Veins to cultivate Long Jie.

"The young ones are lucky!" Long Jie spoke, a smile on his face as he turned to Zhu Ge Hun Dun.

As the group conversed, Zhu Ge Hun Dun gradually completed his incantation. The three golden Yuan Qi Veins soared into the air, then exploded with a thunderous roar, transforming into dense Yuan Qi that floated in the starry space.

"Chaotic Gate opens!" Zhu Ge Hun Dun roared, and the surging Yuan Qi formed golden light that converged into a golden door before Luo Tian's group.

"Go on. Good luck!" Zhu Ge Hun Dun smiled and addressed the group.

"Please let Master Zhu Ge lead the way," Sun Miechen said with a smile, his tone cautious. He feared Zhu Ge Hun Dun might play tricks.

Chapter 1436: Stone Statues and Ghostly Demons

"Unexpectedly, the God-King Sun Miechen is so timid!" Zhu Ge Jie's face showed disdain as he stepped into the light portal.

Sun Miechen smiled, pretending not to hear Zhu Ge Jie's words. His gaze turned to Zhu Ge Hun Dun.

"Master Zhu, is only one person from the Chaotic Domain entering?" Sun Miechen asked softly, then turned his gaze to Zhu Ge Huangchao.

"Of course not!" Zhu Ge Huangchao's face was cold, then he also stepped into the light portal.

"Then we'll go in too!" Seeing Zhu Ge Jie and Zhu Ge Huangchao enter, Sun Miechen spoke softly and stepped into the light curtain.

"Wait a moment. The Chaotic Domain has one more person!" Zhu Ge Hun Dun smiled and addressed Sun Miechen as he approached the light curtain.

"Hmm?" Hearing Zhu Ge Hun Dun's words, Sun Miechen stopped. His eyes showed confusion; he couldn't fathom who else in the Chaotic Domain had the qualifications to enter the Chaotic Abyss.

"I am!" A cold voice echoed in their ears. A figure clad in grey robes walked from the starry space into Luo Tian's group's view. Though he seemed to lack power, his entire being appeared fused with the starry space.

"Master of the Chaotic Domain's disciple!" Luo Tian and his group were startled. They hadn't expected Zhu Ge Hun Dun to awaken the disciple of the Chaotic Master so quickly.

The Chaotic Master had no children. People thought he had no descendants until recently, when they discovered he had one hidden disciple.

"Zhu Ge Qingtian!" Luo Tian looked at the youth who seemed to have returned to simplicity, his eyes filled with a hint of seriousness. Sun Miechen and Yan Hongtao felt some caution, but encountering Zhu Ge Qingtian, the disciple of the Chaotic Master, Luo Tian truly had no confidence.

Luo Tian had met three people related to the Era Masters: one was the Master of the Melody and the son of the Reincarnation Body, Zhong Lian. The other was the prince of the Mortal Race, Ming Huan. Their strength needed no explanation; Luo Tian had fought Ming Huan before and was nearly suffocated by him. If not for his carelessness, Luo Tian might have perished in that battle.

As for Zhong Lian's strength, Luo Tian regarded it highly. After all, his parents were of extraordinary talent and could be considered the strongest among peers.

"Are you Luo Tian?" Zhu Ge Qingtian smiled, scanning Luo Tian's group before focusing on him. Though he had just awakened, Zhu Ge Qingtian naturally knew about the events in the Chaotic Domain.

"Yes," Luo Tian nodded. Though Zhu Ge Qingtian's status was intimidating, Luo Tian wouldn't fear him.

"Very strong. I hope we can cooperate in the Chaotic Abyss!" Zhu Ge Qingtian smiled and spoke softly.

"Cooperation?" Hearing Zhu Ge Qingtian's words, Luo Tian's brow furrowed. His words seemed absurd.

"Although we need to cooperate, there will still be a battle in the end! As for how to cooperate, you'll know once you enter the Chaotic Abyss!" Zhu Ge Qingtian laughed and stepped into the light curtain.

"Go on. You do need cooperation. The Chaotic Abyss is different from other deadly places. I hope you can set aside past grievances then!" Zhu Ge Hun Dun spoke softly, reminding the group.

Luo Tian didn't understand what Zhu Ge Hun Dun meant but didn't dwell on it. His main goal was the Magnetic Light of Immortality; anyone who dared to compete with him would be his enemy.

"Go!" Luo Tian and Long Jie exchanged glances, then bowed to Zhou Wei before flying into the light curtain.

"Finally, I can see the Chaotic Abyss!" Sun Miechen, Zhou Wei, and Yan Hongtao's eyes showed eagerness as they flew into the light curtain, vanishing from Zhu Ge Hun Dun's sight.

...

The waves of energy affected Luo Tian and his group. A series of grey vapors rose around them, forming an invisible vortex that transported them across time and space. Their faces showed tension as they didn't know where they would be taken.

Time passed slowly. After about a quarter of an hour, Luo Tian and his group felt dizzy from the whirlwind and finally landed on the ground.

As soon as they landed, their bodies tensed. They shook their heads and looked around.

Grey earth, grey sky, grey atmosphere—everything obscured their vision. They showed tension because the first sight of the grey mist gave them a dizzying sensation.

"Here?" Zhu Ge Qingtian, Zhu Ge Jie, and Zhu Ge Huangchao stood in the grey mist with cold expressions, as if waiting for Luo Tian's group.

"Buzz..." As soon as Luo Tian's group landed, Sun Miechen, Zhou Wei, and Yan Hongtao followed closely, landing near Luo Tian's group.

"Since we're all here, let's go in together. It'll be a help!" Zhu Ge Qingtian smiled and addressed Luo Tian's group, showing no signs of considering them enemies.

"Who wants to go with you?" Sun Miechen sneered, not wanting to be with Zhu Ge Qingtian, as he was a formidable opponent.

"You seem to know this place better than us!" Zhu Ge Qingtian, naturally sociable, ignored Sun Miechen's hostility.

"Besides, you won't have a choice. Soon we'll face the first danger zone, which is the only path to the abyss!" Zhu Ge Qingtian spoke, obviously knowing more about this place.

"Fine. But let's make it clear: I won't be grateful to you. If there are any opportunities, I'll still strive for them!" Sun Miechen sneered but followed Zhu Ge Qingtian's group.

Luo Tian said nothing, standing with Long Jie. Yang Hongtao and Zhou Wei also stood there, indicating they would follow Zhu Ge Qingtian's group.

"I hope you don't hold us back!" Zhu Ge Huangchao sneered and mocked.

"Who holds who back is uncertain!" Sun Kemin retorted, his eyes showing contempt towards Zhu Ge Huangchao.

"Let's go!" Zhu Ge Qingtian smiled and signaled Zhu Ge Jie to lead the way. Though he had heard Zhu Ge Hun Dun's introduction of this place, Zhu Ge Qingtian was entering for the first time. It would be better to have Zhu Ge Jie, who had been here before, lead the way.

Zhu Ge Jie had come multiple times. He nodded slightly, knowing that to reach deeper, they needed cooperation.

"This Chaotic Abyss seems different from other deadly places. The Chaotic Master himself had entered it, so the first part of the path was cleared by him. However, it's still extremely dangerous, as if prepared for training future generations or selecting disciples. The seemingly perilous areas all have a chance of survival!" Zhu Ge Jie spoke softly, scanning Luo Tian's group. He believed that Luo Tian's group weren't foolish; in a deadly place, cooperation was more beneficial.

"Enough talk. Lead the way!" Sun Miechen's eyes showed impatience as he addressed Zhu Ge Jie.

"Go!" Zhu Ge Jie sneered and moved forward, walking through the grey mist as if on flat ground.

"Stay close. Even with your spiritual awareness, you can only see a hundred feet ahead. If you get too far, you'll get lost!" Zhu Ge Jie's voice echoed in Luo Tian's group ears. They showed a hint of tension, following Zhu Ge Jie closely.

After walking for half an hour, Zhu Ge Jie stopped. Two hundred-foot-high stone statues blocked the path of Luo Tian's group.

The statues were lifelike, with fierce expressions and stone fangs. Though they didn't glow, they gave a sinister feeling.

"This is the first trial of the Chaotic Master!" Zhu Ge Jie addressed Luo Tian's group, looking at the statues blocking their path.

"Two broken stone statues. What's so special about them?" Sun Kemin sneered, stepping forward toward the statues.

"Come back!" Zhu Ge Jie's face changed and he shouted, but it was too late. Sun Kemin's speed wasn't slow; before Zhu Ge Jie's words finished, he was within a hundred feet of the statues.

"Crack..." A series of cracking sounds echoed. As soon as Sun Kemin's foot touched the ground, the ground around the statues began to crack. A pale bone hand emerged from the ground.

Then, more bone skeletons crawled out of the ground as if rising from a grave. However, these bones radiated waves of chaotic energy.

Four red glows flickered; the statues' eyes emitted fierce, evil energy. Their stone skin began to break off in pieces, as if triggered, rapidly reviving their massive bodies. Their powerful presence radiated an overwhelming aura.

"What's going on?" Sun Kemin turned around, standing in front of the group with a serious expression.

"Damn it! This was going smoothly before you messed it up!" Zhu Ge Jie's face was cold, looking at Sun Kemin.

Massive wings flapped, sending gusts of wind that swept over Luo Tian's group.

"Only early Era level!" Sun Kemin looked at the two massive statues. Though their energy was impressive, it wasn't anything to them.

"You don't know a thing! The Chaotic Master's methods are beyond your comprehension!" Zhu Ge Huangchao's face was serious as he scolded Sun Kemin.

"Roar..." A low growl came from one of the revived statues. Next, green energy filled the sky and rushed toward Luo Tian's group.

Chapter 1437: Decline in Cultivation

The stench of the green mist filled their senses, causing everyone's faces to change abruptly.

"Don't let that green mist touch you!" Zhu Ge Jie shouted, raising a light barrier to shield Zhu Ge Qingtian's group. His eyes showed deep concern.

Luo Tian's group also raised barriers, trying to block the green mist.

"What is this thing? Poison?" Sun Kemin shouted, watching the green fog gradually obscure their vision.

"You idiot! Next time you don't listen to me, I'll kick you out!"

"Originally, we just needed to attack the statues from a distance and break them to pass safely. Now because of you, the two statues have revived, along with these skeletons. It's too complicated!" Zhu Ge Jie's face was grim as he scolded Sun Kemin.

As Zhu Ge Jie spoke, the other statue finally revived. It spat out waves of grey mist that filled the sky.

The two statues seemed to complement each other, turning the originally foul green mist into a pleasant fragrance. Their combined power also increased dramatically.

The barriers of the group were gradually eroded by the dense energy, penetrating within moments.

"Smells nice!" Sun Kemin's face showed a dazed expression as he spoke softly, his voice laced with laziness.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian's face was grim in the dual mist, feeling an invisible force enter his body. It gradually spread and wrapped around his Reincarnation Immortal Body.

Waves of energy began to spread across the Reincarnation Immortal Body. The once mighty Reincarnation Immortal Body became somewhat withered under this force.

"Your cultivation is sealed!" The others' faces also showed shock, feeling their cultivation was strongly suppressed.

"Sun Kemin, you did this!" Besides Luo Tian and Long Jie, everyone scolded Sun Kemin, their gazes unkind.

"I didn't do it on purpose!" Sun Kemin protested loudly. He then waved his hand, and a white light flew from it—Yangyu.

"This time is my fault. I'll take responsibility for the mess I made!" Sun Kemin's face was grim. As Yangyu appeared, his cultivation stopped. However, he felt a green energy in his dantian that balanced his Era power, causing his cultivation to drop to the early Era level.

Others also used their methods, but it was too late. Including Luo Tian, everyone's cultivation dropped by a level.

"You caused the problem yourself. Go and take down those two big guys!" Zhu Ge Jie's group showed mockery, looking at Sun Kemin.

"Take them down... " Sun Kemin saw the mockery in their eyes and instinctively wanted to argue with them. However, he then saw the two hundred-foot-high statues that had revived, radiating fierce energy with red eyes watching him.

The countless skeletons around the two statues each carried powerful waves. They were so strong that even Sun Kemin couldn't discern their strength.

"Luo Tian, you have to help me!" Sun Kemin shrank his neck and looked at Luo Tian.

"Long Jie, everyone is friends. You also have to help me!" Sun Kemin's plump face showed flattery as he approached Long Jie.

"Sun Kemin, hurry and fight. Don't waste our time!" Zhu Ge Huangchao's eyes showed mockery as he watched Sun Kemin beg Luo Tian and Long Jie, constantly urging him.

"Go!" Luo Tian saw the mockery in Zhu Ge Huangchao's eyes and his gaze flashed with coldness. He then flew forward, rushing toward one of the statues.

"I'll take the other!" Long Jie's eyes showed excitement as he rushed toward the other statue.

"The skeletons, I'll take care of them!" Luo Tian addressed Sun Kemin, assigning the three roles clearly.

"Okay!" Sun Kemin's eyes showed a hint of coldness. He then used Yangyu to protect himself, rushing toward the countless skeletons.

Before their words finished, Luo Tian rushed toward the statue that spat out green mist. He launched a powerful punch.

Though his cultivation was suppressed to early Era level, Luo Tian's punch still held immense power. The thunderous impact struck the statue that was far larger than his size.

"Crack..." Stone fragments fell. The massive statue only lost some pieces under Luo Tian's punch, causing his face to change abruptly. His fist felt numb, and he retreated.

"Roar..." When Luo Tian's group entered the range of a hundred feet around the statues, both statues and countless skeletons began to violently attack.

Massive stone claws rushed toward Luo Tian. Grey energy radiated from the grey stone claws.

"Damn it! What kind of defense is this!" Luo Tian's eyes showed concern. He was shocked by the statue's变态 defense.

Though his cultivation had been suppressed to early Era level, Luo Tian was confident that his punch could severely injure anyone at the early Era level, even someone as strong as Sun Miechen.

"Unbelievable defense!" Seeing Luo Tian's powerful punch, which had no effect on the statue, Sun Miechen and others' faces changed.

"Boom..." As they were stunned, the massive stone claws, as if born from chaos, collided with Luo Tian again.

Luo Tian's face turned grim. Under the statue's attacks, his legs were deeply embedded into the solid ground.

"Boom..." Before Luo Tian could react, the second stone claw followed and struck Luo Tian's body. His body sank a few more inches.

On the other side, Long Jie wasn't faring better. His golden light shone brightly as he clashed with the other statue. Each collision made Long Jie's face pale a little.

Among the three, Sun Kemin had it slightly better. Though the skeletons were also troublesome, each time he shattered them, they quickly regenerated. However, their strength was relatively weak.

"Ha! You really think the Chaotic Abyss is so simple? This is just the beginning. These statues were crafted by my master. The statues contain a ghost, which my master subdued with supreme methods to become an immortal and unkillable existence!" Zhu Ge Qingtian's eyes showed reverence as he spoke softly, clearly knowing the statues' origins.

However, the group only watched without taking action. They knew Luo Tian was strong, but they had to take responsibility for Sun Kemin's mistake. If Luo Tian's group couldn't pass the first trial, they wouldn't need to continue.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian's body was about to sink into the grey earth, a white light flashed. Next moment, Luo Tian burst out of the ground, his lips bleeding slightly.

"A beast! I don't believe I can't break your defense!" Luo Tian waved his hands, flying through the air. A golden vortex appeared above everyone's heads, radiating a powerful suction.

"Vajra Attack!" Luo Tian pointed his finger. White Era seals flew from his hand and entered the vortex.

"One force breaks all methods!" The sound of a divine chant echoed. Luo Tian recited the "Feathered Immortal Scripture," turning it into an invisible wave that entered the vortex. The massive suction even absorbed a lot of the dense grey mist.

A golden seal shattered space, radiating immense pressure. It fell heavily and was none other than the "Severing Heaven Seal" of the Severing Heaven Master.

"Truly strong. No wonder it's the strongest attack of the Severing Heaven Three Techniques!" Zhu Ge Qingtian's eyes flashed with light, his gaze showing a hint of fear.

As the group marveled at the two great techniques combined in the seal, it fell heavily on the statue.

The thunderous sound echoed in their ears. The ground trembled three times. The hundred-foot-high statue, under Luo Tian's full power "Severing Heaven Seal," shattered into a pile of debris that scattered in all directions.

"Done!" Luo Tian smiled, then looked at Long Jie and Sun Kemin's direction. He chuckled lightly.
