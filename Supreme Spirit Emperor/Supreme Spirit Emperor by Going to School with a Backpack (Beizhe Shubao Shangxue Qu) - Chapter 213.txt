“Trying to escape our eyes? You're still too green. Do you know who I am? I'm the first prodigy of the Demon Realm, the most prestigious race in the Demon Realm—the Yellowing Ghost Sable Clan!” Diao Dezhù's face bore an air of nobility as he addressed the youth.

“Hmph. So you're from the Yellowing Ghost Sable Clan. I've heard of Diao Yuanshan, but as for you, Diao Dezhù... I've never heard of you. Two men—one at the initial stage of Sainthood, one at the threshold—dare to block my path?” The youth's gaze swept over Luo Tian and Diao Dezhù’s cultivation levels, his expression laced with disdain.

“Hah! We are both prodigies of our time. Defeating opponents above one’s rank is commonplace. A mere Saint at the intermediate stage? How audacious!” Diao Dezhù boasted, his voice brimming with unshakable confidence. Yet his body slowly retreated behind.

Though the opponent had suffered heavy wounds, he remained at Saint intermediate. Diao Dezhù, a half-step Saint, was merely his meal—easily crushed with one palm.

“Hand over the fragment of the Epoch Scripture, and I’ll let you go,” Luo Tian spoke softly. If he could avoid a fight, he preferred not to clash with the enemy.

“Hah! The Shura Domain has deployed its elite, even our domain master has come forth. We’ve risked tearing relations with the Demon Realm just for this fragment of the Epoch Scripture. You expect me to simply hand it over with empty words? How naive! Though I’ve been wounded, I am but a Saint at the initial stage. You dare to steal from me? How foolish!” The youth’s face curled with contempt, his hand summoning a crimson spear.

“Then I have no choice but to act myself!” Luo Tian sighed, his spear—Rip-Heaven Spear—materializing in hand. His body flickered, instantly appearing before the youth. Golden spear light flashed like a streak of lightning, lunging toward the opponent.

“Fast!” The youth’s heart jolted. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to strike so swiftly, his reflexes lagging by a heartbeat.

Yet the youth was no ordinary foe. A Saint at the intermediate stage and a powerhouse of the Shura Domain, his combat experience was terrifying. His body twisted at an unnatural angle, evading Luo Tian’s sharp spear.

At the same time, the crimson spear shot forth like a venomous snake’s fang, instantly piercing Luo Tian’s shoulder. The coldness of the spear seeped into his body, forcing him to recoil.

“Two tricks? You think you can trouble me Yan Hongtao? How naive!” The youth sneered, licking the blood on his spear’s tip. His eyes gleamed with a thirst for blood.

“Quickly end this! If the Demon Realm’s forces find me, it’ll be a problem,” Yan Hongtao transformed into a streak of crimson light, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Earlier I was careless. I am a veteran warrior. Now I shall fight seriously!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, his Rip-Heaven Spear emitting a resonant hum. It became a storm of golden light, unyielding and charging toward Yan Hongtao.

“Hmph. Luo Tian has met his match! I’ve never seen him so serious before. Indeed, he’s a Saint at the intermediate stage. How did this Yan Hongtao grow so strong? His vitality surpasses Luo Tian by decades, yet he’s reached Saint intermediate. Truly astonishing!” Diao Dezhù mused, watching the battle.

Yan Hongtao’s body flickered as he clashed with Luo Tian. His mind was equally awestruck—this was his first encounter with a foe like Luo Tian. Though wounded, he remained at Saint intermediate, confident he could defeat most Saint initial-stage opponents.

Moreover, his greatest strength—combat experience—had no effect on Luo Tian. The only success was the initial spear strike to Luo Tian’s shoulder. After that, every attack was blocked by Luo Tian, and even when he couldn’t block, it only resulted in mutual injuries.

“Can’t continue like this. If the Demon Realm’s others find me, I’ll be in trouble!” Yan Hongtao’s eyes flashed with endless killing intent. He retreated, hurling his crimson spear into the sky. His hands formed seals, infusing it with power.

Yan Hongtao sought a swift end. Luo Tian felt the spear’s terrifying aura and narrowed his eyes, sensing its power. His dantian roared with thunderous sounds as a vast ocean of energy surged, black and endless magic qi spilling from his body. His aura rose again, nearly reaching Saint intermediate.

Chapter 948: Shura’s Killing Art

At the entrance to the Demon Realm leading to the Divine Beast Domain, Luo Tian was enveloped in black qi, a faint smile on his face. The sky swirled with dark mist, turning the entire space into darkness.

“Is this a secret technique? The Divine Beast Domain’s magic? Are you a member of the Demon Clan?” Yan Hongtao asked, his face puzzled. He recalled Luo Tian’s rumors from before when he had hidden in the Holy City.

“Hmph. Your identity is intriguing. I heard you’re from the Four Sacred Star Domains, and now you’ve arrived in the Demon Realm with the Fire Domain. Now you wield a demon clan’s technique. Indeed, the demon clan only has this magic of converting to demonic qi that stands out!” Yan Hongtao smiled, not attacking immediately. He waited for Luo Tian to complete his demonic transformation.

“Who I am or my identity doesn’t matter. What matters is that I claim the fragment of the Epoch Scripture today!” Luo Tian’s face was resolute, a black demonic sword materializing. His expression radiated confidence.

“Brave words. But Yan Hongtao, who dominates the Shura Domain without a single defeat, won’t be impressed by you!” Yan Hongtao’s face remained pale but his eyes were bright with unshakable confidence.

Luo Tian knew there was no need for words. The opponent was also a prodigy, and at such an age to reach Saint intermediate—Luo Tian wasn’t sure if he could achieve the same at that age.

“Kill!” Yan Hongtao’s hands formed seals, transforming into a crimson dragon. The spear absorbed the power, emitting thunderous roars and expanding outward.

“Shura’s Shadow Kill!” Yan Hongtao growled, the crimson spear splitting into eight red dragons. Each could severely wound a Saint initial-stage opponent.

“Your power has diminished, but it should be enough for you!” Yan Hongtao spoke softly, his eyes filled with anticipation. He awaited the moment Luo Tian’s heart was pierced by his sacred spear.

“Do you think this is enough to kill me? Not yet!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness. His black blade surged skyward, combined with the Brahma Attack Technique. The first five blades of the Seven Demon Blades struck instantly, clashing with the eight crimson dragons.

“Boom!” Thunder rumbled as stars exploded. Diao Dezhù trembled in fear.

“Terrifying! Luo Tian has become even more formidable. Is this his ultimate state?” Diao Dezhù muttered, praising.

“Damn! My body is wounded, and my strength has dropped too much. I can’t even subdue a Saint initial-stage opponent!” Seeing his attacks neutralized, Yan Hongtao finally showed unease. He now regarded Luo Tian as a foe with the potential to surpass his rank.

“Sixth Blade…” Before Yan Hongtao could attack again, Luo Tian’s face was cold. The sixth blade of the Seven Demon Blades descended with fivefold power, amplified by the Brahma Attack Technique and the Ten Thousand Xuan Feather Drum. A Saint initial-stage opponent would be crushed by this strike.

“Damn! This kid is truly strong. He’s the strongest Saint initial-stage I’ve ever faced!” Yan Hongtao’s hands formed seals, his red light flashing again. He bit his tongue, spitting blood onto the crimson spear.

Absorbing Yan Hongtao’s blood, the spear expanded rapidly. It tore through space, radiating an unstoppable aura. It clashed with Luo Tian’s sixth blade.

The entire starry sky trembled under their attacks, the area within a thousand miles turning into a vacuum. Countless lightning bolts exploded beneath the stars.

“Pf!” Yan Hongtao, already wounded, could no longer withstand it. He spat blood, his eyes wide with disbelief. His gaze locked onto Luo Tian, as if he hadn’t expected to be wounded by him.

“Damn! If I were at my peak, even you would have been killed!” Yan Hongtao’s face bore intense regret. Since his emergence, he had never lost. Now, he was defeated by a younger opponent with lower cultivation, leaving him in unbearable despair.

“Victory and defeat are natural. If you were at your peak, I would have hesitated. But now, you’re not my match. One last chance—hand over the Epoch Scripture fragment, and I’ll let you go,” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with sharpness as he addressed Yan Hongtao.

“Do you think only you have secret techniques? A cultivator from the Four Sacred Star Domains has one. Does the Shura Domain not?” Yan Hongtao’s face bore a resolute expression, his voice solemn.

“Shura Blood Demon Transformation!” Yan Hongtao’s hands moved rapidly. A string of seals flew from his palms, coiling around him like blood serpents.

Hearing Yan Hongtao’s words, Luo Tian’s eyes widened in shock. He hadn’t expected the Shura Domain to have secret techniques. Yet his gaze soon turned grave, sensing a dangerous aura.

The seals spread outward, the crimson serpents entering Yan Hongtao’s body. Under Luo Tian’s astonished gaze, Yan Hongtao spat blood. His injuries healed instantly, his complexion returning to normal. His aura reached its peak—no longer the wounded form he had before.

“Crack!” Crimson lightning rose under Yan Hongtao’s grip, then shattered. He sighed, “Ah… I still suffered injuries. Otherwise, my strength would have been greater! But it should be enough to deal with you!”

Crimson mist enveloped Yan Hongtao’s form again. His overwhelming aura surged into the sky, forming a crimson dragon that crushed toward Luo Tian.

“Damn!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with hatred. He knew Yan Hongtao was terrifyingly strong now, his injuries fully healed. Even if he unleashed his demonic transformation, Luo Tian knew he could only endure for a moment before fleeing.

“Come on! Let me see how much I differ from a true Saint intermediate!” Luo Tian’s face was filled with battle spirit. He flickered, appearing ten thousand feet away from Yan Hongtao. His dantian roared with waves of sound, black demonic qi surging outward.

“Seventh Blade!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness. He knew only the seventh blade could harm a fully recovered Saint intermediate.

“Shura Slash!” Yan Hongtao’s face was filled with killing intent. The crimson spear, under his control, rose into the starry sky, radiating an eerie red glow. Its sharpness made one shiver.

Both sought to deliver a fatal strike, their auras gradually coalescing. A red and black barrier formed, colliding and devouring each other.

Diao Dezhù’s face was filled with admiration as he watched Luo Tian and Yan Hongtao. He felt their overwhelming auras, stepping back tens of thousands of feet.

“Looks like Luo Tian won’t subdue that Shura Domain kid,” Diao Dezhù’s eyes darted, knowing the gap between ranks was immense. If Luo Tian truly killed Yan Hongtao, it would be astonishing—Saint initial-stage opponents facing Saint intermediate with courage was rare.

“Hmph!” Diao Dezhù chuckled, a thought forming in his mind. His black eyes gleamed with light, standing there to await the final clash between Luo Tian and Yan Hongtao.

As Diao Dezhù pondered, Luo Tian’s seventh blade gradually formed. A sky-piercing blade of light, immense pressure forcing Yan Hongtao to show a hint of unease. He knew this was Luo Tian’s ultimate reliance.

“Excellent! You’ve made me feel the danger. If I were still in my previous state, this attack would have killed me!” Yan Hongtao spoke softly, admiration in his voice.

“Unfortunately, you’re not my opponent!” Yan Hongtao’s hands moved slightly. His aura coalesced, the crimson spear—though small—radiated coldness. It contrasted sharply with Luo Tian’s blade, yet within this seemingly small spear was a power capable of destroying heaven and earth. It could kill a Saint intermediate—Yan Hongtao’s ultimate secret weapon.

“Shura Domain’s Shura Kill!” Diao Dezhù saw the blood-soaked spear and his face showed fear. Others might not know, but as the grandson of Diao Yuanshan, he clearly knew how terrifying Shura Kill was.

Diao Dezhù had once heard Diao Yuanshan say that when the Demon Domain’s domain master, Long Zhan Tian, was alive, he had dueled with the Shura Domain’s domain master Yan Xiu Luo. Yan Xiu Luo had used Shura Kill to match Long Zhan Tian in a draw. Since then, no one else had used Shura Kill. Now Yan Hongtao employed it, leaving Diao Dezhù in shock.

“Wail…” A wailing sound arose. Countless souls emerged from Yan Hongtao’s body, howling like ghosts. He seemed to be a demon emerging from hell.

“Go!” The souls wailed, burning fiercely under Yan Hongtao’s control. They turned into a mass of ash, entering the crimson spear. The spear’s power multiplied several times over, and the entire world changed color.

“Seventh Blade! Brahma Attack Technique!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with madness. Sensing the spear’s power, he gambled everything by invoking the Ten Thousand Xuan Feather Drum.

Previously, Luo Tian had never used the Ten Thousand Xuan Feather Drum with his seventh blade. He hadn’t known if it could withstand its power.

But now, threatened for life, he had no choice but to gamble. His black blade pierced through the sky, as if splitting the entire starry space. It struck the sacred drum’s surface.

Chapter 949: Did Diao Dezhù Die?

Under the Demon Realm’s starry sky, a black blade pierced through the heavens. It struck a fiery red sacred drum with thunderous sound.

The explosion echoed, the black blade shattering. At the same time, the sacred drum of Ten Thousand Xuan Feather Drum also shattered.

“Hah! Your blade failed, I suppose!” Yan Hongtao’s face was filled with mockery. He looked at the two storms of black and red, laughing.

“Failed?” Luo Tian’s brow furrowed. His expression was puzzled. He hadn’t known what would happen when he first used the seventh blade on the Ten Thousand Xuan Feather Drum.

“Defeating a sacred artifact with one strike. I’ve never seen that before. But what good is it?” Yan Hongtao laughed, his voice filled with pride. The crimson spear surged forward, piercing through space toward Luo Tian.

“Can’t block!” Luo Tian’s forehead broke out in cold sweat. He looked at the crimson spear approaching him, its overwhelming pressure capable of subduing even a Saint intermediate. How could he withstand it?

In an instant, Luo Tian’s brow lifted slightly. His eyes flashed with sharpness: “It’s not over yet!”

“Brahma Attack Technique!” Luo Tian ignored the crimson spear that could kill him. His hands moved rapidly, a string of black seals forming into a black dragon. It rushed toward the shattered Ten Thousand Xuan Feather Drum and the seventh blade of the Seven Demon Blades.

“Desperate struggle! My Shura Kill is an ultimate weapon. Today, no matter your talent or prodigy status, you’ll fall!” Yan Hongtao’s face was filled with mockery. His voice carried disdain.

“Hum…” But in the next moment, Yan Hongtao’s crimson eyes showed disbelief.

The seals spread outward. After absorbing Luo Tian’s Brahma Attack Technique, the two terrifying storms fused together. They formed a green blade of light, condensing into something tangible. Green light spread, radiating destruction and earth-shattering power. It was no less formidable than Yan Hongtao’s crimson spear.

“Fusion with a sacred artifact!” Yan Hongtao was stunned. He hadn’t seen this before, his voice filled with shock. His body tensed.

Previously, Yan Hongtao had been confident Shura Kill would end Luo Tian. Now he was uncertain. He wasn’t sure if his ultimate attack could kill Luo Tian.

Luo Tian felt the same. He had prepared to flee, unsure of the fusion’s power or whether it could withstand Yan Hongtao’s crimson spear.

Under their tense gazes, the crimson spear collided with the green blade.

“Boom!” Thunder rumbled. The two martial arts clashed, their power seemingly weak but the waves were overwhelming. A terrifying explosion turned the surrounding area into a vacuum.

“Pf!” Both Luo Tian and Yan Hongtao spat blood. Their faces were pale as paper, their bodies weakened to the extreme. They stood at the center of the explosion, naturally affected by it. As martial arts users, they suffered severe backlash and injuries.

After an hour of thunderous sound, the terrifying waves finally ceased. Luo Tian and Yan Hongtao stood under the starry sky, gazing at each other with admiration in their eyes.

“Kid, you’re the first to make me so helpless. Good. Today we’ll stop here. I’m leaving now. Remember my name, Yan Hongtao. One day, I’ll take your life!” Yan Hongtao’s face was pale, his voice filled with determination. His body flickered, rushing toward the entrance of the Divine Beast Domain.

Luo Tian’s face bore a bitter smile. He sighed inwardly, acknowledging the gap between himself and a Saint intermediate. Yan Hongtao still had mobility, while Luo Tian could only stand under the starry sky, unable to chase him.

Yan Hongtao’s face was pale. His body flickered into a streak of crimson light, but his speed was only slightly faster than a half-step Saint. Yet it was enough.

“Ah… I seem to have no chance with the Epoch Scripture in the Demon Realm,” Luo Tian sighed, looking toward Diao Dezhù. But he didn’t see his figure. Cold sweat flowed down his face.

“Damn! Did Diao Dezhù get killed by that explosion? If so, my grandfather will tear me apart!” Luo Tian’s mind panicked. His powerful spiritual sense searched but found no sign of Diao Dezhù, confirming his suspicion.

“Done for! Done for!” Luo Tian’s mind drummed. Cold sweat dripped from his face, thinking of Diao Yuanshan’s terrifying cultivation. If Diao Dezhù was truly dead, his grandfather would go mad. Even if he escaped, he couldn’t escape a Saint peak’s pursuit.

“Hmph?” Yan Hongtao noticed Luo Tian didn’t chase him. His mind relaxed slightly, his eyes filled with confidence.

At the entrance of the Divine Beast Domain, he gazed at Luo Tian one last time before rushing into it.

But Yan Hongtao didn’t know that, as he turned in, his mind was at its most relaxed. Even Yan Hongtao himself didn’t notice a faint purple light flash before him, vanishing instantly as if it had never existed.

Yan Hongtao had suffered multiple injuries. His body and mental state were at their worst. He couldn’t sense this tiny change, disappearing into the Divine Beast Domain.

Luo Tian didn’t even care if Yan Hongtao entered the Divine Beast Domain. His face was anxious, searching desperately but finding no sign of Diao Dezhù. He was certain Diao Dezhù had been reduced to nothing by their battle. After all, it was a technique capable of killing a Saint intermediate. Diao Dezhù, merely a half-step Saint, was too far away.

“Damn it! You said you could escape so well. Why didn’t you run? You’ve really messed me up! I swear!” Luo Tian stood under the starry sky, almost crying. He wanted to escape but couldn’t leave his companions behind. He was truly stunned. The strongest he had encountered was Gu Tianshu, followed by Diao Yuanshan.

If Gu Tianshu were at his peak, it would be okay. But Luo Tian wasn’t sure if Gu Tianshu could restrain Diao Yuanshan’s rage.

“What to do now?” Luo Tian sighed, taking out a pill and swallowing it. No matter what, restoring his injuries was the most important.

As Luo Tian just swallowed the pill, a wave of energy erupted from the entrance of the Divine Beast Domain. His heart jolted. At this state, a half-step Saint could kill him. The Divine Beast Domain had also offended both the divine and demon clans. If a Saint-level powerhouse came, he would die here today.

“Damn it! What the hell is this!” Luo Tian felt regret. He had thought everything was foolproof, but now he faced such a situation.

“Go to hell! Even if I don’t die, returning would mean being killed by Diao Yuanshan. It’s worth it to fight a few Divine Beast Domain scum!” Luo Tian’s voice carried ruthless intent. At this point, he had no choice but to go all out. He didn’t even look at the entrance of the Divine Beast Domain, closing his eyes to focus on healing.

“Luo Tian truly is remarkable. He can heal under such conditions!” A voice echoed. Figures gathered, Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian appeared before Luo Tian, their faces filled with admiration. They looked around, their expressions shocked at the vast explosion of space still unhealed, showing how intense the battle had been.

“Why is Luo Tian so injured!” They felt Luo Tian’s injuries, their shock indescribable. This was the first time they had seen Luo Tian so severely wounded. In their view, a Saint initial-stage opponent should have been crushed by him. Even if he lost to a Saint intermediate, he could easily escape. How could he be so severely wounded?

Luo Tian heard their voices, his face bitter. He slowly opened his eyes, relieved to see Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian. But he had clearly sensed a wave at the entrance of the Divine Beast Domain, not knowing who it was. Now there was no sign.

“Take me back to the Holy City first!” After a brief recovery, Luo Tian had enough strength. He spoke weakly to them. The time for confrontation was inevitable. He couldn’t abandon his companions and let Gu Lei, Zheng Xin, etc., bear Diao Yuanshan’s wrath.

Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian nodded. They knew Luo Tian wasn’t ready to explain the details. They had also followed his identity jade token, enduring Gu Lei and Du Yuying’s persistence to find out what was happening. They hadn’t expected to arrive just in time.

They lifted Luo Tian, disappearing into the starry sky. Their bodies became streaks of light, heading toward the Holy City.

Just after they vanished, a tall old figure slowly appeared. His face bore a smile as he gazed toward the entrance of the Divine Beast Domain.

“Entering the Divine Beast Domain, it’s still my divine clan’s territory!” Sun Hefeng smiled, rushing into the Divine Beast Domain. His eyes gleamed with excitement.

Sun Hefeng had arrived earlier than Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian. He had just witnessed Yan Hongtao entering the Divine Beast Domain’s entrance. Luo Tian was still healing there, though he wanted to crush him with one palm. But thinking back, this place was still within the Demon Realm’s domain. He didn’t want to be discovered by the demon clan’s elders, especially with the Epoch Scripture temptation. A single Luo Tian’s death was insignificant.

Chapter 950: Success?

In the Holy City of the Demon Realm, Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian brought Luo Tian back to the Rhino Clan’s territory. Upon returning, Luo Tian announced he would close himself off for healing, refusing to see anyone.

The entire Holy City was tense. All beasts and humans discussed the auction’s event—how the Shura Domain had stolen the Epoch Scripture. The entire Demon Realm stirred, with all beasts frantically searching for the Shura Domain’s seven figures.

The Phoenix Clan leader Feng Hongzhi, representing the Eight Sacred Clans, issued a command. Whoever provided clues about the Shura Domain’s seven figures would be heavily rewarded. The race providing the clue would become a direct subordinate of the Eight Sacred Clans, allowing marriage with them.

Beasts valued bloodlines. Being able to marry with the Eight Sacred Clans was a significant enhancement of bloodline power. If their offspring had a mutated bloodline, it would be a great gain—perhaps even becoming an extraordinary talent.

Such generous rewards made the entire Demon Realm go wild. Beasts rushed through the Demon Realm, and the Eight Sacred Clan leaders personally led their people in searches. The Epoch Scripture was too precious to be replaced by any pseudo-Epoch Treasure. Even the Eight Sacred Ancestors were out searching for those seven Saint intermediates.

However, the Eight Sacred Ancestors knew that since the Shura Domain had openly come to steal it, they were certain of their ability to take the Epoch Scripture. Thus, they didn’t hold high hopes.

Time passed swiftly—three days had gone by. The frenzy of searching for the Shura Domain’s seven figures hadn’t lessened. Fortune favored those who persisted. Finally, after the entire Demon Realm’s search, three Saint intermediates from the Shura Domain were captured—those who had appeared as leaders at the auction.

After Feng Hongzhi’s soul-searching, it shocked the Eight Sacred Clans. The three were merely decoys—pawns to draw attention, allowing Yan Hongtao to escape successfully.

Not only were the three decoys, but all six others besides Yan Hongtao were also distractions. If they could escape, it meant luck; if not, capture was inevitable. The result of capture was predictable.

The enraged Eight Sacred Clans executed the three, their heads severed and hung on the Holy City’s high gates. Flames continuously burned them.

After capturing the three and soul-searching, the Eight Sacred Clans knew Yan Hongtao had escaped. Three days was enough for a Saint intermediate to use secret techniques and flee into the Divine Beast Domain.

Yet the search for the Shura Domain hadn’t faded. Though not as frantic as before, the Holy City’s orders remained. Many races still sought to climb the ladder by finding the remaining three Shura Domain warriors.

The Rhino Clan also participated in the search initially, responding to the Eight Sacred Clans’ call. But it gradually faded as Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian returned with Luo Tian, confirming Yan Hongtao had escaped into the Divine Beast Domain.

After three days of recovery, Luo Tian’s injuries were seven-tenths healed. Though his strength had declined slightly, it was no longer a problem.

That day, Luo Tian opened his eyes. His face remained pale—not from injuries but from thinking about Diao Dezhù’s death and how to confess it to Diao Yuanshan.

“Ah… the inevitable has come. Life and death are fate,” Luo Tian sighed, getting up from his bed and stepping out of the vast room.

The Rhino Clan people naturally recognized Luo Tian. They knew his strength and his identity as a cultivator. He was also close to Diao Dezhù, the sole heir of the Yellowing Ghost Sable Clan. From every perspective, they respected Luo Tian.

Luo Tian smiled bitterly as he responded to the bows of the Rhino Clan people. He walked toward Gu Lei and Zheng Xin’s residence.

The Rhino Clan had allocated a large area of houses for Luo Tian and his group. Their residences weren’t far apart. When they had time, the group would gather to chat and joke.

Even with the Demon Realm’s chaos, it didn’t stop them from joking. They stood in a pavilion, shouting loudly and laughing often.

Luo Tian heard their laughter, his face showing a smile. He walked toward them slowly. Yet he heard a familiar voice.

“I’ll tell you, you weren’t there. That battle was truly earth-shaking. Fortunately, I was there. Luo Tian still lives because of me. Otherwise, the result might have been different. That Shura Domain kid was too strong. Luo Tian’s injuries were from that Shura Domain opponent. At the crucial moment, my great self appeared and saved Luo Tian!” A proud voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. His brow furrowed slightly, sensing the familiarity.

“Wow! So strong!” Du Yuying’s eyes sparkled as she listened, her naivety evident. She believed the obvious exaggerations.

“Stop boasting! You’re only a half-step Saint. Besides bragging, I don’t know what else you can do!” Gu Lei and Xu Liyi laughed, exposing the lies. Their faces showed disdain.

“You dare insult the noble Yellowing Ghost Sable Clan! I’m furious! Don’t believe me? Wait until Luo Tian recovers and ask him yourself. What was the situation!” The speaker, clearly angered by Gu Lei’s words, spoke loudly.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian heard the familiar voice. His initial reaction was joy, but his entire body couldn’t help cursing. He flickered into the crowd.

The group had been engrossed in listening and hadn’t noticed Luo Tian’s arrival. His sudden appearance startled them, but upon seeing it was Luo Tian, their faces lit up with joy.

The main speaker in the center seemed immersed in something. His mouth kept narrating, absorbed in it. Even Luo Tian’s arrival went unnoticed.

Luo Tian looked at the speaker, his eyes glowing with light. Who else but Diao Dezhù?

“Hmph? Why are you all silent?” Diao Dezhù, narrating passionately, noticed the silence. His face showed displeasure. When he realized it was Luo Tian, his expression changed.

“Ah! Haha! It’s Luo Tian!” Diao Dezhù awkwardly greeted, secretly praying Luo Tian wouldn’t expose his earlier boasts.

“How did you return?” Luo Tian smiled but didn’t expose Diao Dezhù. He crossed his arms, looking at him.

Diao Dezhù felt a chill under Luo Tian’s gaze. He thought Luo Tian was upset for not taking care of him when he was wounded, feeling guilty: “Well… I…”

“Boom!” Before Diao Dezhù could speak, Luo Tian’s fist struck him. It sent Diao Dezhù flying backward.

Luo Tian controlled the punch’s strength well, not hurting Diao Dezhù but making him suffer for days.

“Luo Tian… you… boom…” Luo Tian seemed to vent his anger, continuously beating Diao Dezhù. His inner curse: “Who the hell let you scare me? I was so scared I didn’t even dare leave, fearing to see Diao Yuanshan and be crushed by one palm!”

The people around only Long Yongfu and Jin Tianshu were close to Diao Dezhù. Seeing Luo Tian’s madness, they dared not intervene. They silently prayed: “Brother, good luck. Don’t worry, we’ve driven away the Rhino Clan people so you won’t see this beating!”

“Luo Tian, what’s wrong with you?” The people around asked, confused about Luo Tian’s sudden outburst.

But Gu Lei and Zheng Xin were secretly excited. They had often been beaten by Luo Tian. Now seeing Diao Dezhù get beaten, they felt a strange sense of solidarity and excitement.

“Luo Tian… you’ve gone too far… I admit I didn’t take care of you… but that’s not a reason to beat me!” Diao Dezhù wept, his words interrupted by Luo Tian’s punches. He couldn’t explain, his words forced back into his stomach.

The sound of thunder echoed continuously for a quarter-hour. Finally, Luo Tian was satisfied and stood up, gazing at Diao Dezhù lying on the ground.

“Speak. Where were you that day?” Luo Tian adjusted his clothes, addressing Diao Dezhù on the ground.

“You actually hit me! My grandfather never did that!” Diao Dezhù’s face bore委屈, looking at Luo Tian and shouting.

“Your grandfather!” Upon hearing Diao Dezhù mention Diao Yuanshan, Luo Tian recalled his previous fear and dread. His eyes flashed with danger again. He lightly clenched his fists, producing a crisp sound.

“Don’t… don’t…” Diao Dezhù quickly spoke, his voice filled with begging. He silently cursed himself for losing his reputation again. Previously defeated by Long Jie, he had lost face. He wanted to regain some of his image through this incident. But now, another Luo Tian had appeared.

Diao Dezhù was certain that Luo Tian was restraining him. He had no good luck in front of Luo Tian. First, he had fled helplessly on the封神大陆. Second, he was brutally beaten by Long Jie. Third, he was harshly beaten by Luo Tian. This lesson had made him learn his lesson thoroughly.

“Too many people here. Not convenient to speak!” Diao Dezhù, with sly eyes, didn’t speak but sent a mental message to Luo Tian.

“Speak. We’re all friends. What’s there to fear!” Luo Tian, interested, also sent a mental message to Diao Dezhù.
