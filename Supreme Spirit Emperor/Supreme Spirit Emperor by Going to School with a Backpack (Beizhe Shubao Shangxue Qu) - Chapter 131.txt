“Curse... Why am I thinking about that aristocrat again? Ugh!” Yu Mingxue muttered internally, her mind fixated on Zhang Daotian’s faults.

Lo Tian stood atop his flying dragon, gazing at the approaching crimson phoenix silhouette in the distance. A faint smile tugged at his lips.

Chapter 641: Shattered ()
Chapter 641: Shattered

Lo Tian lightly tapped his dragon’s back, and a thunderous roar echoed across the Heavens’ Path Sect. At the same time, Gu Qianxue’s phoenix let out a series of cries, flying toward Lo Tian’s dragon.

A dragon and phoenix circled endlessly in the sky. Lo Tian gazed at Gu Qianxue standing atop the phoenix, momentarily entranced. Gu Qianxue’s eyes reflected tenderness and longing as she returned his gaze.

They locked eyes, as if the world had vanished around them.

This scene stirred emotion in Siku Chen and Jiang Yuanguai, who smiled warmly at their disciples.

“Boom!” The dragons and phoenixes beneath them shattered simultaneously, transforming into a dazzling explosion of fireworks.

Lo Tian stepped onto empty air, approaching Gu Qianxue with a gentle expression. He gently took her hand and whispered, “You’ve waited long enough.”

Gu Qianxue’s face bloomed with joy. She said nothing, standing silently before Lo Tian. Her voice echoed in his mind: “I know you have inner turmoil. I can wait.”

“Idiot, no more waiting. I believe Yunting will forgive me!” Lo Tian softly caressed the soul-nourishing jade at his waist.

“Hum…” The jade emitted a green glow and humming sound, as if responding to his words.

“Let’s go. Don’t keep people waiting,” Lo Tian said again, taking Gu Qianxue’s hand and walking toward the platform.

“Truly a match of talent and beauty!” The crowd murmured in admiration.

Gu Qianxue’s beauty needed no explanation; as a renowned beauty of the Heart-Seeking Sect, she was unparalleled. Meanwhile, Lo Tian now bore Zhang Daotian’s appearance—a man whose youth had been far more handsome than Lo Tian.

“Cough…!” The first elder of the Heavens’ Path Sect, Mu Rongcheng, smiled broadly. His hearty voice rang out: “All here today marks the wedding of my sect’s young master and Yao Biyue of the Heart-Seeking Sect. Thank you for coming. I represent my brothers Siku Chen and old friend Jiang Yuanguai to express our gratitude!” His voice was not loud, yet it resonated across the heavens, stirring people’s spirits.

“Enough talk. I’ll officiate these two! As cultivators, we don’t adhere to mundane rituals. The ceremony will be simple—three bows!” Mu Rongcheng smiled, addressing Lo Tian and Gu Qianxue who had landed on the platform.

Lo Tian smiled warmly, leading Gu Qianxue to Siku Chen and Jiang Yuanguai. His gaze carried respect as he looked at Siku Chen.

Under Mu Rongcheng’s guidance, Lo Tian and Gu Qianxue knelt on the ground, bowing thrice to Siku Chen and Jiang Yuanguai. The ritual of bowing to heaven and earth was omitted—cultivators fought against the heavens and earth, not worshipped them.

After bowing to Siku Chen and Jiang Yuanguai, Lo Tian and Gu Qianxue stood, gazing at each other. A final mutual bow would make them husband and wife in the eyes of the crowd.

“Next, the couple bows to each other!” Mu Rongcheng announced loudly.

Amidst murmurs of admiration and cheers, Lo Tian and Gu Qianxue slowly lowered their heads toward each other.

“Pf!” Yu Mingxue, high above the sky, turned deathly pale. A mouthful of blood spewed from her lips as she clutched her chest, aching with sorrow.

“Why does my heart ache? Why!” Yu Mingxue’s mind screamed, her eyes bewildered and vacant.

“Boom…!” Just as Lo Tian and Gu Qianxue were about to bow, a deafening explosion echoed in the ears of all.

The sky turned black, and Tian Dao Mountain trembled violently. Not only did the mountain shake, but the entire Xian Gu Continent shuddered like a collapsing world. Fragile peaks crumbled into dust.

“Pf!” Some disciples of the Nascent Soul Realm spat blood, while others barely initiated in the Bone-Formation Stage fainted.

Devastation and annihilation—entire skies began to collapse, plunging the Xian Gu Continent into darkness.

“What’s happening!” The elders of the Twelve Sects gasped, sensing their entire continent trembling. They shouted in alarm.

Apocalypse struck not just the Heavens’ Path Sect but all of the Xian Gu Continent. Disciples below Nascent Soul Realm fainted en masse, while weaker cultivators disintegrated into blood mist.

“Haha…” A chorus of laughter echoed across the world, as dark voids emitted terrifying waves.

A blood-red moon appeared in people’s sight, like locusts swarming. Black figures emerged from the void, spreading across every corner of the Xian Gu Continent.

“Could it be that the Xian Gu Continent collided with another realm?” Mu Rongcheng’s face paled, his voice filled with shock.

“Collision must be the cause. Otherwise, such a terrifying wave couldn’t have been created by human hands!” The elders of the Twelve Sects stared in awe, stunned by this occurrence.

Even more alarming was that black figures still emerged from the shattered void—lowest among them were Nascent Soul Realm masters.

Lo Tian gaped at the sky’s collapse, but his face turned icy when he saw the black-cloaked figures.

“Tian Shi Sect!” Lo Tian gritted his teeth, recognizing the moon emblem on their robes.

Seeing these black-cloaked figures, nearly all visitors from the Tian Yuan Continent gasped in shock. Those who hadn’t awakened still looked bewildered.

“Buzz…” A humming sound echoed from the waist of every Tian Yuan Continent visitor, originating from the Xian Gu Dao Seal.

Lo Tian felt his own Xian Gu Dao Seal vibrate, his face showing shock as he sensed his soul gradually leaving Zhang Daotian’s body. He observed events in a different form now.

“I…” Lo Tian felt helpless, unsure if others experienced the same. He could only watch helplessly as events unfolded—his current self was powerless to act.

Chapter 642: The Arrival of the Apocalypse ()
Chapter 642: The Arrival of the Apocalypse

Like Lo Tian, all visitors from the Tian Yuan Continent entered another form, observing events. Faintly, people sensed that what was to come would be a monumental event—a long-buried secret.

“I feel we’re approaching the Chronological Scripture. With this continent’s life as a sacrifice, it must summon the Chronological Scripture!” A black-cloaked figure frowned, gazing at people on the Heavens’ Path Sect with a condescending air.

Seeing the leader of the black-cloaked figures, Siku Chen and others trembled in their hearts. They murmured involuntarily: “World Master!”

Not only the leader, but other black-cloaked figures radiated immense power. Even those who had grasped a fragment of chaos energy numbered over fifty, while the rest were at the Soul-Annihilation Stage. The weakest among them was at Nascent Soul Peak.

“Seems like a wedding is happening here,” the black-cloaked figure surveyed Siku Chen’s group, smiling slightly.

“Who are you?” Mu Rongcheng asked cautiously, eyeing the leader.

“Your executioners!”

“Disperse and slaughter this continent! The rest of you, form a blood array here to summon the Chronological Scripture!” Ignoring Mu Rongcheng’s group, the black-cloaked elder smiled and ordered his subordinates.

“Yes…” The dark voices responded, flying in all directions.

“Damn!” Seeing the World Master ignore them and plan to annihilate the entire Xian Gu Continent, Siku Chen’s group felt despair.

“Go!” The World Master elder surveyed the people on Tian Dao Mountain, then ordered his subordinates to stay. He remained behind, sketching strange symbols in the air with his fingers. Waves of gray energy emerged from his hands, forming an odd mark in the sky.

“Kill…” The black-cloaked figures roared, charging at Siku Chen’s group. Meanwhile, the rest rushed toward the Heavens’ Path Sect disciples and other sects attending Zhang Daotian’s wedding.

“Kill!” Mu Rongcheng and Siku Chen’s group bore fierce expressions. There was no time to ponder; they couldn’t let these people massacre freely.

The Heavens’ Path Sect disciples roared, charging at the black-cloaked figures. The scene turned chaotic again, leaving Lo Tian and others stunned.

Bloodstained chaos engulfed the entire Xian Gu Continent, with black-cloaked figures acting like reapers, mercilessly harvesting cultivators’ lives. Blood mist surged skyward, flowing toward Tian Dao Mountain.

Within a million square miles of Tian Dao Mountain, blood mist was especially thick. The Heavens’ Path Sect trembled constantly, as if the mountain would collapse at any moment. Siku Chen’s group fought against black-cloaked masters amidst the blood mist, their overwhelming power leaving Lo Tian and others trembling.

Though the Heavens’ Path Sect elders were strong, they still fell short of the black-cloaked figures. Combined with the suffocating blood mist, the black-cloaked figures fought with divine assistance, their power soaring.

The Heavens’ Path Sect disciples rapidly declined, causing Lo Tian’s eyes to redden. His vision showed Ren Hongzhi and others struggling against black-cloaked figures, nearly beheaded multiple times.

“1 million… 500,000… 300,000…” Half a day passed. The Heavens’ Path Sect’s million disciples and elders suffered heavy losses, transforming into blood mist that flowed toward the array drawn by the World Master.

“Ah…” Mu Rongcheng’s group seethed with fury. The Heavens’ Path Sect was their life’s work, yet within half a day, it had been reduced to 300,000. How could they bear this? They ignited their blood essence and fought desperately.

Not only the Heavens’ Path Sect, but all twelve sects across the Xian Gu Continent faced this tragedy. Other sects were even worse, as their elders had come to the Heavens’ Path Sect for Zhang Daotian’s wedding, leaving their sects dangerously weak.

Siku Chen’s eyes held endless coldness as he grabbed Zhang Daotian, who was no longer Lo Tian but the real Zhang Daotian. Zhang Daotian’s face showed tension as he looked at Siku Chen.

“Don’t fear, your master is here!” Siku Chen’s face softened as he gazed at Zhang Daotian, his hands moving swiftly.

“Tian Dao Thunder Sword!” Siku Chen roared, a lightning bolt piercing through the thick blood mist and landing in his hand.

“Remember, you are my Siku Chen’s disciple. Remember to avenge your brothers!” Siku Chen smiled, attaching a storage pouch to Zhang Daotian’s waist.

The Tian Dao Thunder Sword cleaved through the void, creating a rift in the heavens. A powerful suction force emerged, even drawing in the thick blood mist.

“Go, Daotian. You are our sect’s only hope. Live!”

“Daotian, remember, you will always be my Ren Hongzhi’s brother! Ha!”

“Little ancestor, live on!” The Heavens’ Path Sect all roared, their faces resolute.

“Even before me, you dare to flee?” The black-cloaked World Master elder sneered. He stood beside the blood array, watching people die with a drunken expression.

The black-cloaked figure extended a finger, sending an invisible wave outward. The world seemed to exist only for him, while Siku Chen’s group appeared as ants.

“Is this a World Master’s barrier?” Siku Chen’s face showed shock. Even he, at Soul-Formation Peak and having grasped a fragment of chaos energy, could not resist the World Master’s power. He couldn’t even move.

“You have a strong soul. You must be a alchemist. Join me, and you and your disciple can survive. Otherwise, no one will.” The black-cloaked figure spoke as if offering charity.

Siku Chen’s brows furrowed, ignoring the black-cloaked World Master’s words. He gazed at Zhang Daotian, who he had subdued: “Don’t worry. Your master is here. The path ahead must be yours to walk.”

Chapter 643: Awakening from a Dream ()
Chapter 643: Awakening from a Dream

Zhang Daotian kept shaking his head, his eyes filled with entreaty as he gazed at Siku Chen.

“I, Siku Chen, have only one disciple. For this disciple, I would do anything—even sacrifice my old life!” Siku Chen laughed loudly, his body radiating powerful waves.

“Elder, is he about to self-destruct?” The black-cloaked figure finally showed fear. A master who had grasped a fragment of chaos energy, if self-destructed, would be terrifying—enough to injure even a World Master.

“With my残躯, I’ll shatter the cycle of rebirth!” Siku Chen’s aura surged. His alchemist soul began burning, and his body, previously immobile, suddenly moved like a meteor toward the black-cloaked figure. His hand held a green lightning bolt, striking the World Master.

This strike was Siku Chen’s ultimate effort, burning all his cultivation and even the fragment of chaos energy. It was his strongest attack—enough to make a World Master wary.

Indeed, the black-cloaked World Master’s face showed slight concern but only that. His gray energy surged, revealing the chaos energy sought by Soul-Formation Peak masters.

“Crack!” Thunder split the sky, and in people’s shock, the Tian Dao Thunder Sword pierced the World Master.

Yet despair gripped them: a Heavenly-grade treasure, the Heavens’ Path Sect’s sacred artifact, had unleashed its ultimate strike. Yet it was instantly repelled.

“Self-destruct!” Siku Chen didn’t hesitate, exploding himself.

Before his self-destruction, Mu Rongcheng smiled and kicked Zhang Daotian into the passage Siku Chen had opened.

“Live well!” Mu Rongcheng whispered, his eyes complex before his body became a meteor toward the black-cloaked World Master.

Two masters who had grasped fragments of chaos energy’s self-destruction was no small matter for the black-cloaked World Master. He wrapped himself and his subordinates in gray energy.

“Boom…!” A devastating aura echoed again, tearing through the sky and vanishing into unknown realms.

At the moment of their self-destruction, the fissure Zhang Daotian fell into slowly closed.

“Master, Siku Chen!” The remaining seven elders of the Heavens’ Path Sect looked heartbroken, their gazes gradually numb.

“Alas… such a pity…” The black-cloaked figure appeared in people’s sight, sighing.

The massacre continued; the Heavens’ Path Sect disciples kept dying. Other sects’ elders fought against black-cloaked figures who had grasped fragments of chaos energy.

But with Siku Chen and Mu Rongcheng’s self-destruction, the already weak Heavens’ Path Sect was further devastated. Disciples died constantly, turning into mist absorbed by the array.

Ren Hongzhi and others were bloodstained, laughing as they were pierced through the chest by black-cloaked figures. Even in death, they chose self-destruction, their eyes filled with hope toward the direction Zhang Daotian vanished.

Ren Hongzhi was the first, followed by other elders’ descendants who fell one after another. Yet they didn’t hesitate—each chose self-destruction, their pride evident.

“Buzz…” At the peak of the chaos, a golden light pierced through the void, emerging from it toward the black-cloaked World Master.

“Finally, you’ve come!” The black-cloaked World Master’s face, previously calm, now showed excitement.

“That book is of great use to him! We cannot let it fall into his hands!”

“Because this book, they’ve bloodied the Xian Gu Continent!” Jiang Yuanguai and other sects’ remaining elders looked desperate, their eyes filled with resentment.

“Dare to disrupt my disciple’s wedding! I’ll fight you!”

“Die, and don’t let it get to you!” Jiang Yuanguai leapt into the void toward the black-cloaked World Master, self-destructing. The first elder of Starry Sect and the Dark Temple’s elder also self-destructed.

Like a storm, they surged toward the golden Chronological Scripture. They knew even their combined self-destruction couldn’t kill the World Master, but they could prevent the book from falling into his hands.

With dozens of Soul-Formation Peak masters and seven or eight who had grasped fragments of chaos energy, they rushed toward the golden book. With默契 (mutual understanding), they self-destructed.

These masters were titans, their self-destruction’s power immense. Even the World Master was shaken and evaded their attack.

Their self-destruction created a storm, sweeping toward the golden book. The entire Tian Dao Mountain vanished under this storm, destroying both Heavens’ Path Sect disciples and the black-cloaked World Master’s subordinates.

Lo Tian stared blankly at the storm engulfing the sky, a wave of sorrow instantly filling his soul. Though he had known this might be an illusion, he had spent considerable time in the Heavens’ Path Sect, considering it his second home. Now, its destruction left him heartbroken.

“Damn!” A cold voice echoed in the sky. The black-cloaked World Master stood pale, his face bloodied.

Though Jiang Yuanguai’s self-destruction didn’t kill the World Master, it still harmed him significantly.

“Pf!” The black-cloaked World Master spat blood, which vanished into the void.

“Buzz…” The scene ended here, vanishing from Lo Tian’s sight. Yet he could guess the entire Xian Gu Continent had been destroyed.

Consciousness slowly returned, and Lo Tian regained his original state. The surrounding scene transformed into the desolate view upon entering the Xian Gu Ruins.

“Roar!” Lo Tian let out a long cry, tears of blood streaming down his cheeks. A wild aura rose from him, shattering the few small hills nearby into dust.

At the same time, human presence emerged within a hundred miles of Lo Tian. Hearing his cry, they marveled inwardly.

In the Xian Gu Ruins, ten thousand Tian Yuan Continent’s geniuses had been reduced to a few hundred thousand. Most of them, like Lo Tian, wore sorrowful expressions. Some had no change in their gaze—like a black-cloaked youth several hundred miles away, whose lips curled slightly. This was the genius from the Western Regions.

Chapter 644: Oath to Heaven ()
Chapter 644: Oath to Heaven

Lo Tian’s current state was highly unstable. The Chronological Scripture, long dormant in his mind, now hinted at awakening. A stream of crimson energy flowed from its final page toward his dantian.

“Return!” Lo Tian sneered, his eyes cold. At this moment, he held no gratitude for the Chronological Scripture.

It had taken his prime cultivation, and now it had destroyed all life on the Xian Gu Continent. This made him wary of the Scripture while adding a hatred—though he knew this was due to human greed, not the Scripture itself.

Lo Tian gently touched the ground, still feeling a trace of the Heavens’ Path Sect’s aura despite years of erosion.

“This is the Heavens’ Path Sect ruins. Though worn by time, true treasures will never be buried!” Someone roared, awakening Lo Tian.

“Yes! This is the Heavens’ Path Sect. With our ancestor’s inheritance, I won’t let anyone touch it!” Lo Tian roared, his eyes resolute. He thought of the elder who had sacrificed everything for his disciples, tears welling in his eyes.

As Lo Tian mourned, his body emitted a series of thunderous sounds. His three souls, previously sealed, now gradually awakened. His aura surged again.

“Suck!” Lo Tian inhaled deeply, drawing the surrounding energy into his body. A massive vortex of energy rushed into him.

Though the Xian Gu Continent was destroyed, its energy—thicker than Tian Yuan’s—had not vanished. Lo Tian’s inhalation emptied the nearby hundred miles of energy.

“Someone has ascended?” The surrounding Tian Yuan Continent geniuses looked surprised, stunned that someone had ascended immediately after leaving that world.

“Soul-Annihilation Peak… Soul-Annihilation Apex!” Lo Tian’s aura climbed to the Soul-Annihilation Apex before stopping. His eyes darkened as he surveyed around, a softness on his face.

Feeling himself at the Soul-Annihilation Apex, Lo Tian showed no joy—his face was grim. He roared: “Tian Shi Sect! I, Lo Tian, swear today to annihilate the Tian Shi Sect!”

“Is that Lo Tian? The Heavens’ Path Sect’s Zhang Daotian, the little ancestor?” People gathered around Lo Tian as energy flowed and his roar echoed.

At this point, no matter which region’s genius looked at Lo Tian, their hostility had vanished. They had deeply immersed in that world and were now Heavens’ Path Sect disciples, viewing Lo Tian with a new perspective.

“Lo Tian!” People greeted him, their eyes softening.

Seeing familiar faces around him, Lo Tian showed rare warmth. He spoke softly: “All of you must have guessed it—our greatest enemy is the Tian Shi Sect. The Xian Gu Continent has been destroyed, but the Tian Yuan Continent still stands.”

“To prevent the same tragedy from happening here, we must strengthen ourselves. I won’t compete with you for the elders’ inheritance, but I must obtain Danzong’s inheritance and find the Tian Dao Thunder Sword to give it back to my master, Zhang Daotian!” Lo Tian’s words echoed clearly, stirring urgency in their hearts.

“Lo Tian!” Zheng Xin’s voice rang out in his ears, slightly restoring his sorrowful heart. He looked at Zheng Xin, who had become a streak of light before him.

Zheng Xin was no chatterbox; her face showed sorrow, just like Lo Tian. She had formed deep bonds with Ren Hongzhi and others. Seeing them self-destruct, she longed to fight the Tian Shi Sect immediately.

But Zheng Xin now fully understood the Tian Shi Sect’s power, far exceeding expectations. Compared to the Xian Gu Continent, the Tian Yuan Continent was at least one level weaker. If not for the Xian Gu’s barrier, the Tian Yuan Continent would have suffered even more.

“Go! Everyone search!” Lo Tian smiled, shouting at the thousands surrounding him.

“Also, please don’t fight over unnecessary matters—don’t turn on each other. Now we must preserve strength and return to the Tian Yuan Continent. The Tian Shi Sect is our common enemy!” Lo Tian reiterated before leading Zheng Xin toward the Heavens’ Path Sect ruins.

Others, seeing this, also flew toward the ruins, searching for familiar places.

Lo Tian and Zheng Xin soared over the ruins. Though Tian Dao Mountain had collapsed for countless years, Lo Tian’s powerful spiritual sense allowed him to detect anything beneath the ground tens of thousands of feet deep.

“I found it! This was Master Mu Rongcheng’s residence. Go, you’ll surely gain his inheritance and boost your strength!” Lo Tian smiled, punching a black hole before them.

Zheng Xin didn’t hesitate, flying into the entrance. Meanwhile, others also found the Heavens’ Path Sect elders and senior disciples’ locations. The ruins echoed with thunderous sounds.

Lo Tian’s vast spiritual sense searched relentlessly. Time passed slowly until a black hole caught his attention. His spiritual sense probed it.

This probe caused Lo Tian’s face to fill with murderous intent, his eyes cold. He punched the ground, and “Boom…” The earth exploded, revealing what lay beneath.

A black-cloaked youth stood before Lo Tian. Upon sensing his presence, the youth’s eyes flashed with murder before vanishing. Before him lay several Tian Yuan Continent geniuses, their bodies sprawled in death, faces purple.

“Western Regions!” Lo Tian sneered coldly.

“Lo Tian, I didn’t seek you out. You’ve come to me instead. Earlier, you killed my Western Regions companions without cause. This debt must be settled!” The youth’s body radiated purple energy, leaping into the air before Lo Tian. He spoke softly.

“Speak! What’s your connection with the Tian Shi Sect?” Lo Tian asked, his eyes seeing this youth as already dead. He wouldn’t let him live after killing Tian Yuan Continent geniuses without reason.

“Haha, do you think I’ll tell?” The youth spread his hands, releasing purple poison energy. At the same time, insect noises echoed in Lo Tian’s ears.

Chapter 645: Reencountering Poison ()
Chapter 645: Reencountering Poison

“Poison?” Lo Tian’s eyes narrowed. He had encountered poison’s terror before—Gu Lei, with a poison-type body, had once made him suffer. Now facing a poison-type genius from the Western Regions at Soul-Annihilation Peak, Lo Tian had no choice but to be cautious.

Yet he also had his own strength: the antidote to poison, the碧晶琉璃火 (Bijing Lilihuo). Now outside that world, he could use any means—including the terrifying Bijing Lilihuo.

“Kill!” Lo Tian moved, becoming a rainbow streak toward the black-cloaked youth. He appeared before him instantly and launched a “Mortification Fist.”

The youth remained calm, his face equally cold. His purple fist met Lo Tian’s Mortification Fist.

“Boom!” A heavy sound echoed. Lo Tian, now at Soul-Annihilation Apex, had superior strength in body and energy over the youth. Even a Soul-Annihilation Initial Stage genius couldn’t withstand his fist.

The two fists collided, and the black-cloaked youth showed surprise. He was sent flying like a meteor, crashing into something and creating a deep pit with dust swirling around.

“Hmm?” Lo Tian frowned, his eyes puzzled. Though he had seemingly gained the upper hand, he felt a trace of purple energy seeping into his body through his pores.

“Terrifying poison!” Lo Tian murmured, a single thread of energy slowing his Soul-Annihilation Apex strength. A regular Soul-Annihilation Stage genius would suffer serious injuries from this.

“Why is he so strong? I mustn’t fight directly!” The black-cloaked youth felt fear. He had already considered Lo Tian strong, but this one punch left him in a mess.

Lo Tian’s eyes showed no mercy. He ignited his fire-type energy, expelling the trace of purple poison. Then he flew toward the youth again, launching a “Mortification Fist” and a “Cyclic Rebirth Fist.”

“Damn!” The black-cloaked youth’s face twisted with rage. Knowing his body couldn’t match Lo Tian’s, he quickly formed hand signs. Purple energy surrounded him, forming a massive purple hand to strike Lo Tian.

“Get out!” Lo Tian roared, his voice carrying the might of heaven and earth. He turned, meeting the purple hand with two fists.

“Boom!” Another heavy sound echoed. The youth’s mid-tier grade-3 technique was shattered by Lo Tian’s fists, turning into purple mist that scattered around him.

“Haha! You fell for my trap!” The black-cloaked youth sneered, his hands clenching.

The purple mist that had been shattered now enveloped Lo Tian completely, rushing into his body through his pores without mercy.

“Buzz…” Insect noises followed, and the youth waved his hand, sending countless tiny purple specks flying. They swarmed toward Lo Tian like a storm.

“Haha! A disciple of the Five Elements Sect, but just a brute. I wonder what great reward awaits me for killing you!” The youth sneered.

At this moment, Lo Tian realized his mistake—reaching Soul-Annihilation Apex had given him overconfidence. He believed he could crush all Soul-Annihilation Stage geniuses.

Countless purple energies seeped into his body, slowing his energy flow. A coldness spread from the purple energy.

Lo Tian quickly activated his fire-type energy to resist the terrifying poison, but then heard insect noises.

Countless specks surrounded him instantly. Meanwhile, the purple poison energy outside his body vanished, absorbed by these tiny specks.

Lo Tian’s spiritual sense couldn’t count the number of purple specks—each was invisible to the naked eye.

“Cultivation insects!” Lo Tian gasped, recalling his past encounter with Gu Lei’s poison. Now seeing so many insects, he felt grave concern. One insect had nearly killed Gu Lei at the Nascent Soul Stage; now, countless insects would turn him into what?

In that moment of hesitation, the cultivation insects—having absorbed all the poison energy—emitted a buzzing sound. A greedy intent passed into Lo Tian’s mind.

“They want to devour the poison in my body!” Lo Tian realized, his eyes flashing with determination.

Though the insects surrounded him, they seemed hesitant—somehow sensing something in his body that frightened them.

“Hmm?” The black-cloaked youth showed confusion. These insects were his life’s work, cultivated over decades. He had used this method to kill countless Soul-Annihilation Apex geniuses.

Now, these insects—normally excited by his poison energy—didn’t rush toward Lo Tian’s body. This confused the youth.

“Die!” The black-cloaked youth sneered, his voice sharp. The insects swarmed toward Lo Tian without hesitation.

Lo Tian smirked, then the green flame in his dantian—long dormant—suddenly surged. A scorching heat radiated from him, and emerald flames formed serpentine dragons, flowing through his meridians.

The poison energy entering his body vanished instantly under the green flames.
