“Can you withstand the soul-killing sword qi凝聚 from a million souls?” Nan Gong Yuqing murmured lowly, his gaze carrying a flicker of anticipation.

Luo Tian gazed upward at the formidable sword-shaped phantom凝聚ing in the sky, his eyes flashing with sharp brilliance. His hands moved swiftly, forming the intricate seals of the Great Sun Annihilation Seal.

The sun rose, and the Great Sun Annihilation Seal clashed with the soul-killing sword qi in the heavens. A thunderous explosion erupted, blood qi filled the air, and the radiant light intermingled with countless tormented souls and blood qi, canceling each other out into an invisible wave of force that battered the firmament.

The void above Tiger Prison, usually stable twice as much as ordinary realms, shattered under the collision of their martial arts. Vast expanses of void yawned open.

Yet Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing seemed oblivious, locking eyes through the endless gray mist before dashing toward the center of the disturbance like meteors.

Their speed was unparalleled; those on the ground could only witness streaks of light soaring through the sky. The void ruptured further, as if lightning and thunder rumbled endlessly from their clash, exploding upon the earth.

“First time someone has fought the Young Master to this extent! First time someone has made the Young Master take them seriously!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s subordinates cried out in astonishment.

“Mighty—truly mighty! I once witnessed Sha Cangmang of the Eight Sources Supreme Era, but none have matched this pair’s power!” Chen He Guang’s gaze trembled. The mere collision of their techniques sent waves of terror through the crowd, making them shudder in fear of the monstrous lightning striking their bodies.

Time passed slowly; a quarter-hour slipped by as Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing exchanged nearly a hundred blows.

“Boom…” The final collision sent them scattering, both panting heavily.

Neither was in good shape; Luo Tian’s robes were stained with blood, his body wreathed in green qi bearing deep sword wounds that oozed blood. Worse still, the wounds exuded gray mist, as if constantly gnawing at his flesh, preventing healing.

Nan Gong Yuqing fared no better; his once-calm demeanor had vanished, his hair disheveled, his white robe in tatters with numerous blood holes across his body.

“Fascinating! Ha!” Nan Gong Yuqing laughed aloud, gazing at Luo Tian with admiration.

“You’re the first to leave me so battered! It seems I must unveil my secret techniques if I’m to defeat you!” Nan Gong Yuqing sighed, raising his crimson sword into the sky.

“Come then!” Luo Tian smiled, planting his Ruptured Heaven Spear into the void. Starlight poured down, illuminating both men’s faces.

“Beware!” Nan Gong Yuqing warned, his hands forming seals as waves of energy surged into his crimson sword.

“Hum…” As if drawn by an unseen force, the crimson sword flared with red light, splitting into two, then four…

The clamor of countless swords echoed as nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine blades materialized, halting their division.

“Roar…” The swords coiled above Nan Gong Yuqing’s head, forming a blood-red dragon that exuded an icy aura, awaiting his command.

“Mourning Heaven’s Annihilation Array!” Nan Gong Yuqing chanted, his hands weaving complex seals into the blood dragon.

“Rippling…”, the swords scattered like rain, instantly surrounding Luo Tian’s head.

“Hum…” Waves of power radiated from each crimson sword, forming a red barrier that enveloped Luo Tian.

“If you withstand this array, I shall yield to you!” Nan Gong Yuqing smiled, watching Luo Tian shrouded in red light. His hands shifted again.

“Danger!” Luo Tian’s heart clenched, his gaze locking onto the swords above. His hands moved swiftly, unleashing a surge of emerald flames that erupted into hundreds of fire dragons, charging each sword.

“Soul-Controlling Mourning Heaven!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s lips curled, his spiritual force bursting from his body and attaching to the red barrier.

“Surrender!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s spiritual voice echoed, piercing Luo Tian’s mind. The latter’s expression turned bewildered.

“Go!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s gray spiritual force bore a tangible smile as he pointed, and a crimson sword hummed to life, flying toward Luo Tian.

“Pf…” The red sword pierced Luo Tian’s leg, snapping his confusion into clarity.

“You’re not my equal. Surrender—within my Mourning Heaven’s Annihilation Array and Soul-Controlling Technique, you have no chance of resistance!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s voice echoed like a demonic chant in Luo Tian’s mind.

“Then let us see whose array is stronger!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed, his hands clenching as he roared: “Azure Dragon Sacred Flame Array!”

“Hum…” Luo Tian’s primordial essence surged forth, forming countless streams into the sky, merging with the green fire dragons.

“Roar…” The green flames surged, burning through the void, transforming into fire dragons that devoured each crimson sword. A refining force emanated from the green flames, refining the crimson swords.

Chapter 821: The Truth ()

Within the red barrier above Tiger Prison, crimson swords were devoured by green fire dragons. The terrifying heat and refining force instantly invaded each sword, causing Nan Gong Yuqing outside the barrier to pale slightly.

“The legends were true—Luo Tian absorbed a sect master, and now he wields all the techniques of an ancient ancestor. The Great Sun Annihilation Seal and this Azure Dragon Sacred Flame Array are both legendary techniques of the Azure Dragon Sect’s sect master. I never imagined Luo Tian had mastered them!” Chen He Guang mused, awe in his voice.

“Soul-Controlling Mourning Heaven!” Nan Gong Yuqing, sensing his array being refined, bellowed again.

His spiritual force released an invisible current into the barrier, entering Luo Tian’s body with a calm expression.

Luo Tian’s eyes turned bewildered again, but his spiritual force—far stronger than ordinary—shook violently: “Out!”

The thunderous explosion echoed, and Luo Tian’s eyes snapped open. The strange spiritual tether vanished instantly.

“Roar…” At the same time, the red barrier weakened. Luo Tian pushed off the ground, leaping skyward and striking a punch—Soul-Devouring Fist—into the fragile barrier.

The explosion shattered the red barrier. Nan Gong Yuqing’s crimson swords trembled, then coalesced into one, landing before him. The red light dimmed considerably.

“Again?” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered, gazing at Nan Gong Yuqing whose spiritual force had returned to his body.

“Pf…” Nan Gong Yuqing opened his eyes, spitting blood with a look of disbelief.

“The Young Master has lost!” His subordinates stared at Luo Tian as if seeing a ghost, stunned that their mighty Young Master had been defeated.

Though Nan Gong Yuqing bore no physical wounds, few in the Four Sacred Star Domains could make him spit blood.

In contrast, Luo Tian’s condition was dire; his face was pale, but it was due to overexertion rather than severe injury.

“Master’s might!” The dozen old men accompanying Luo Tian cheered loudly, their voices echoing like children’s, amusing the onlookers.

“You’ve won. Though I still have secrets, their cost is too great. A sparring match isn’t worth it!” Nan Gong Yuqing wiped his lips, addressing Luo Tian.

“Secrets?” Luo Tian’s heart jolted. He hadn’t expected Nan Gong Yuqing to have hidden strategies; he’d already exhausted all his techniques.

“From now on, he is your leader. His words are as mine!” Nan Gong Yuqing pointed at Luo Tian, addressing his subordinates.

“Yes…” The subordinates’ faces showed shock as they gazed at Luo Tian, bowing respectfully.

“Enough talk. I came to see you mainly to introduce you to someone!” Nan Gong Yuqing smiled, indifferent to Luo Tian’s name. Since he’d made the bet, he would abide by it.

“Who?” Luo Tian’s curiosity deepened at Nan Gong Yuqing’s solemn tone.

“Come, you’ll know when we arrive. I won’t harm you!” Nan Gong Yuqing ignored Luo Tian’s curiosity, striding into Tiger Prison’s depths. He knew Luo Tian would follow.

Luo Tian was speechless but intrigued, instructing Zhang He Guang and Tu Hongfei before vanishing, chasing Nan Gong Yuqing’s path.

“Everyone is now allies!” Ma Yingming sighed to the group. The battle’s outcome was clear; he could only honor his promise. Now, Ma Yingming saw Luo Tian as truly worth following—his potential was boundless.

The prisoners stared at each other, awaiting Luo Tian’s emergence. The thought of leaving Tiger Prison and regaining their cultivation filled them with excitement.

…

Nan Gong Yuqing’s pace was unhurried; Luo Tian caught up in moments, following him to an unassuming cell.

“Crack…” Nan Gong Yuqing snapped the iron lock with ease, leading Luo Tian inside. He touched the wall, and a stone door slowly opened, revealing a pitch-black hole.

“Hey, we’re allies now. At least say something! Who is it?” Luo Tian gazed at the abyssal hole, his body trembling as if facing an endless chasm.

“Come.” Nan Gong Yuqing spoke, stepping into the darkness without feeling its terrifying pressure.

Luo Tian gritted his teeth, wary yet determined, stepping after Nan Gong Yuqing.

“Huff…” Upon entering the hole, Luo Tian exhaled deeply, a damp气息 invading his body. A powerful displacement force instantly enveloped him.

Now an Eight-Source Supreme, Luo Tian could control displacement forces and escape them if he resisted. Yet this time, no matter how he struggled, he felt trapped in quicksand, unable to fight back—a first for him since becoming Eight-Source.

“A master! An Unfathomable Realm!” Luo Tian’s heart trembled, sighing only an Unfathomable Realm could make him feel this.

“Hum…” Spatial fluctuations echoed, and Luo Tian’s body appeared in the black barrier beneath Tiger Star.

Nan Gong Yuqing smiled, standing there as Luo Tian emerged, his eyes filled with awe. What shook him was the emaciated old man on the bed—like a corpse, motionless, seated as if enlightened.

Yet when Luo Tian looked at him, the old man slowly opened his eyes, murky and deep, locking onto Luo Tian.

“This old man is older than the Xuanwu Tortoise!” Luo Tian trembled at the old man’s age, stunned to find such a relic in Tiger Star.

“This is the presence I felt outside Tiger Star—anyone would sense danger before this old man!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully.

“Respectful younger brother Luo Tian, I greet you, elder!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice respectful.

“I called you here for a request—something within your power. I won’t demand an oath, only your voluntary aid!”

“Of course, I won’t ask you to do it for free. I’ll help you swiftly reach the Nine-Source Realm and teach you my secret technique. When mastered, it will boost your combat power—Nine-Source level, with your physique and strength, you could withstand the Unfathomable!” The old man’s voice was hoarse but clear.

Luo Tian marveled at the old man’s generosity, yet his face showed no emotion, focusing on Nan Gong Yuqing’s respectful gaze.

Alluring—this reward was too tempting for Luo Tian, exactly what he needed. Yet he knew it wouldn’t be easy.

“Bet!” Seeing Nan Gong Yuqing’s respectful expression, Luo Tian knew the old man was no ordinary Unfathomable. Resolute, he bowed: “I am willing!”

Hearing this, the old man smiled—though it unnerved Luo Tian.

“Good. Then I entrust you. Now, I’ll show you some things, then deliver the reward!” The old man spoke, his withered finger pointing at Luo Tian.

“Hum…” An invisible fluctuation surged from the old man’s finger, pulling Luo Tian’s spiritual force as if by an immense suction. His spirit appeared in another form, traversing time to a mountain peak.

Suddenly, thunderous explosions echoed around Luo Tian, shaking his gray spiritual force.

Numerous voids exploded in his vision, and nine robed elders appeared before him.

“Ha! Vivid life—my favorite thing. Life means immortality!” The nine robed elders smiled, dispersing as Luo Tian joined one of them in a star domain—Shenmo Domain.

Shenmo Domain, adjacent to the Four Sacred Star Domains, was slightly stronger. Yet this place became a battlefield of corpses and blood after one robed elder’s arrival, his body absorbing endless blood qi.

After consuming the blood qi, the elder rejuvenated, his aged face regaining youth.

“Haha, keep these people for now. I’ll slaughter them upon my next awakening. Thus, I can live forever in another way!” The elder spoke, smiling before vanishing into the void. At the same time, Luo Tian’s vision shifted to another robed elder.

Chapter 822: Nine-Source into Demon ()

Luo Tian stood in the ground of Tiger Star, his face stunned. His spiritual force wandered through time, appearing in various scenes.

Nine elders appeared across nine star domains, stealing countless lives and blood essence to fuel their existence, enhancing their lifespans. Stars were shattered, screams echoing in Luo Tian’s ears as if he experienced it himself. His heart burned with fury.

He focused on the Four Sacred Star Domains, his homeland—Tianyuan Continent.

Countless masters arose to resist the robed elders’ assaults, yet they achieved nothing. The continent was shattered by a single strike, its blood qi absorbed before vanishing into the void.

“The truth—Luo Tian finally understood why Tianyuan Continent was destroyed! His fists clenched, watching the death of countless Supreme Elders and even Unfathomable-level masters who vanished into oblivion.

Catastrophe—these nine elders were a cosmic catastrophe, terrifying even Luo Tian who had seen death. They seemed like gods, slaughtering humans as if squashing ants.

“Who are these nine? To survive, they slaughter humanity like livestock!” Luo Tian’s eyes reddened, his gaze filled with murder.

“Mourning Domain! These nine are from Mourning Domain!” The old man spoke solemnly, recalling that dark era.

At the time, he was a mere Six-Source Supreme Elder, surviving due to his sect’s powerful figure. He eventually preserved the sect’s inheritance.

“What do you need me to do?” Luo Tian’s lips curled into a bitter smile. Facing these nine elders, he had no confidence—his current level was only Eight-Source Supreme. Compared to those who could crush entire continents with a single move, he was far behind.

“I despise these nine, but I hate another group more! Hypocrites!” The old man’s eyes were murky, filled with endless anger. The narrow space trembled with his rage.

Hearing this, Nan Gong Yuqing shuddered, his eyes burning with intense hatred, blood qi rising again.

“Shenmo Domain—after that battle, it became fragile. Only two sects remained: the Divine and the Demon.”

“Both sects were strong, their foundations solid, so they preserved their traditions. Yet after years of recovery, the Divine sect’s hypocrites plotted to unify Shenmo Domain!” The old man’s voice remained calm, but Luo Tian sensed his fury.

The old man spoke slowly, and Luo Tian stood still, listening. A tidal wave of shock surged within him—learning a secret about Shenmo Domain.

In truth, the old man and Nan Gong Yuqing were not from the Four Sacred Star Domains but from Shenmo Domain’s Demon Continent. Hundreds of years ago, after Mourning Domain’s chaos, Shenmo Domain gradually recovered. It was divided between the Divine and Demon sects.

But the Demon sect had traitors who colluded with the Divine to assassinate Nan Gong Yuqing’s father, the Demon Sect’s leader. At that time, the old man was an Unfathomable-level master, evading countless pursuers. He carried Nan Gong Yuqing as an infant into the Four Sacred Star Domains, entering Tiger Prison.

As a master of Unfathomable level, after years of effort, he finally advanced to the Saintly Realm—legendary “Unfathomable to Saint.”

If Unfathomable level was a cosmic power, the Saintly Realm transcended all. Unless nearing death, one could not be killed. Even a single drop of blood could revive them—eternal existence.

Yet when the old man entered the Saintly Realm, he sensed two Saints—one from each sect. Their strength was mid-Saint level, which made him wary. He hid in Tiger Prison, fearing for Nan Gong Yuqing’s safety if he left.

Luo Tian was stunned; now he understood the hierarchy beyond Unfathomable—Saintly Realm, which filled him with longing.

“Endless cultivation! Indeed!” Luo Tian sighed, recalling when he left Tianyuan Continent. He thought the Sect Master level was a cosmic power, but after leaving, he realized Tianyuan was just a small continent in the Four Sacred Star Domains.

The old man’s account revealed that even the Four Sacred Star Domains were a minor domain in the universe. There was Shenmo Domain, capable of producing Saints, and Mourning Domain—where those nine elders resided—which was even stronger.

A deep worry formed in Luo Tian’s heart, thinking of the exit connecting to Mourning Domain on Tianyuan Continent. If those nine elders returned, reigniting the catastrophe, Tianyuan would be first to suffer.

Tianyuan had countless masters who all perished, and Luo Tian dared not imagine how the Four Sacred Star Domains would face those terrifying powers.

Seeming to sense Luo Tian’s worry, the old man comforted: “You needn’t be too worried. These nine elders only emerge when their lifespans end, hunting others across domains. Normally, they don’t act. Each battle costs their life essence—what they rely on to survive. That’s why they slaughter others for life essence.”

“Also, over the years, countless domains across the universe have birthed several Saints. Like me—am I not a Saint?” The old man’s voice had a magical quality, calming Luo Tian’s restless heart.

“I must grow stronger!” Luo Tian clenched his fists, determination in his eyes. Though the old man reassured him, he still felt urgency.

“I must reach the Saintly Realm before those Mourning Domain elders emerge, or even if I save Tianyuan now, it will be reduced to nothing in the near future!” Luo Tian resolved, pushing himself.

“My request is for you to accompany Nan Gong Yuqing back to Shenmo Domain when both of you reach the Unfathomable level. Reclaim his position and the Demon Sect!” The old man’s face held hope as he continued.

“Huh?” Luo Tian’s eyes widened, instinctively asking, his face filled with confusion.

“Don’t joke, elder! According to your words, the Demon Sect now has a mid-Saint-level master. How can I help Nan Gong Yuqing reclaim it? We’d be killed the moment we arrive!” Luo Tian shook his head vigorously.

“It’s not now, but when you’re strong enough. Trust your talents—entering the Saintly Realm isn’t a problem. Once in the Saintly Realm, we three should be able to face those two Saints from the Demon and Divine sects!” The old man’s eyes gleamed, his gaze gentle on Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing.

Luo Tian’s face showed contemplation, weighing the pros and cons before nodding. He desperately wanted to grow stronger—any chance was one he wouldn’t miss.

Though the old man said helping him was optional, Luo Tian had his own principles—refusing to accept others’ favors without reciprocating. Plus, Nan Gong Yuqing had saved him before.

Seeing Luo Tian’s nod, the old man smiled: “Good. For the next few days, you two stay here. I’ll help you reach the Nine-Source level. The rest depends on your own efforts. If the right opportunity arises, entering Unfathomable won’t be a problem!”

The old man didn’t want to waste time. He knew both men wanted to boost their strength quickly.

His withered palm extended, grasping the void. A devastating primordial force erupted from his hand, shaking Tiger Star. Those on the ground stared in shock, unaware of what had happened.

“Destruction Primordial!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with brilliance, stunned by the old man’s casual display of such concentrated destruction primordial.

Nan Gong Yuqing remained calm; his rapid rise to Eight-Source was thanks to the old man. He was essentially the old man’s disciple.

As they pondered, a terrifying destruction primordial enveloped them instantly. No need to comprehend it—ferocious destruction primordial flowed into their bodies through every pore.

“Focus on the destruction primordial, and I’ll teach you my self-created technique—‘Into Demon’! When mastered at Nine-Source, it can reach half-Unfathomable level!” The old man’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, filling him with joy.

Chapter 823: The Flourishing Tianyuan Sect ()

In the depths of Tiger Star, Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing sat solemnly on damp ground, their bodies radiating澎湃 destruction force that repeatedly struck the walls.

It had been seven days since they began absorbing destruction primordial. The old man sat like a meditating monk on the bed, and the narrow space only echoed with destruction force’s impact.

On Tiger Star, Tu Hongfei and Ma Yingming grew impatient, leading the group waiting for Luo Tian’s emergence.

“Seven days already—did they go somewhere to fight?” Tu Hongfei, bluntly speaking, leaned against a stone pillar, muttering.

“Don’t speak nonsense!” Ma Yingming’s brow furrowed as he waited for Luo Tian.

“Relax, that kid has luck. Being favored by the Elder is his fortune!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s subordinates gazed at Tiger Prison’s depths with envy.

“Elder? Who is this Elder?” People, bored, gathered around after hearing Nan Gong Yuqing’s subordinates speak. Their eyes held curiosity.

“Can’t say, can’t say! If we do, we’ll die! Just know no one in the Four Sacred Star Domains can match the Elder!” The middle-aged man shook his head like a drum, gazing at Tiger Star’s depths with reverence.

“Boom…”, thunderous sounds echoed in their ears, and they felt the ground tremble slightly. A terrifying aura emerged from underground.

“This aura—its the Young Master’s!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s subordinates felt its power and smiled with joy.

Before they finished speaking, another thunderous sound echoed into their ears—a pressure no less than Nan Gong Yuqing’s. It pressed upon them, as if two ancient beasts awakened beneath their feet. A soul-shaking震慑 was felt.

“Nine-Source! Luo Tian and Nan Gong Qing have both reached Nine-Source!” People gasped, astonished. “They truly are prodigies of this era—both ascending to Nine-Source!”

Belowground, the old man slowly opened his eyes, a satisfied expression on his face. He nodded slightly: “Good, faster than expected!”

“I didn’t misjudge him. In such a short time, he not only mastered ‘Into Demon’ but also reached Nine-Source with Yuqing. His talent and insight surpass even Yuqing!” The old man murmured, then closed his eyes again.

Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing opened their eyes simultaneously, locking gazes. In each other’s eyes, they saw countless stars collapsing into destruction primordial, settling into their dantians.

“Boom…”, a sound like ten thousand horses galloped echoed from their dantians. Nine primordials radiated light within their bodies.

After an hour, they finally exhaled, exchanging glances with smiles.

“Nine-Source—few in the Four Sacred Star Domains are as strong as this. I’ve finally become a Nine-Source master, just one step from Unfathomable. After that, I can return to Tianyuan and open it!” Luo Tian murmured, his eyes filled with anticipation.

Luo Tian knew even now he could return to Tianyuan, activating Jiang Nanxuan’s array. But that wasn’t his goal. He aimed for Unfathomable, breaking the seals set by the Four Sects’ masters to restore Tianyuan’s glory.

“Enough. You two go— I can’t leave here. If I do, those two will find me. In the Four Sacred Star Domains, no one can threaten you now!” The old man’s voice echoed in Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing’s minds without speaking. They appeared in the cell they had entered before.

Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing walked out side by side, breathing fresh air with smiles. Though the underground didn’t affect them, staying long was uncomfortable.

“Elder, you’ll see the light again soon!” Nan Gong Yuqing thought of the old man’s years underground, feeling pity.

“Don’t worry, there will be a day!” Luo Tian patted Nan Gong Yuqing’s shoulder in comfort.

At this moment, Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing felt a kinship—both had left their homelands. One to drive out invaders, the other to reclaim what was lost.

“What now? You’re the leader!” Nan Gong Yuqing crossed his arms, a relaxed expression on his face. He felt his bet was correct; with Luo Tian, he no longer felt burdened.

“Let’s go—first, free the prisoners’ seals. Such a powerful force would be wasted otherwise!” Luo Tian spoke softly, appearing before the waiting crowd.

“Nine-Source—truly Nine-Source! Ha!” Nan Gong Yuqing’s subordinates smiled joyfully.

“Didn’t follow the wrong person!” The dozens of old men Luo Tian had subdued smiled, roaring at his figure.

Tu Hongfei and Ma Yingming also looked excited. Their cultivation was sealed, but now they confirmed Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing’s strength.

Two Nine-Source masters—no one in the Four Sacred Star Domains could suppress them except the Four Sects.

“Haha, Ma Yingming, I didn’t misjudge him! My eyes are unmatched. See if the Azure Dragon Sect’s scum dare to catch me now!” Tu Hongfei patted Ma Yingming’s shoulder, smiling.

“Enough talk. Everyone is waiting— I’ll free your seals now!” Luo Tian was in a good mood, no longer fearing Sha Cangmang or Jin Yongsi.

He spoke and acted: his hands became streaks of light, nine-colored dragons of primordial force emerging. They transformed into seals, raining down from the sky like a shower of seals, entering people’s bodies.

Explosions echoed; Tiger Prison resounded with thunderous waves. Cheers and laughter erupted, as if shaking the heavens.

“Respectful Master!” Tu Hongfei and Ma Yingming led the bow, their voices filled with excitement.
