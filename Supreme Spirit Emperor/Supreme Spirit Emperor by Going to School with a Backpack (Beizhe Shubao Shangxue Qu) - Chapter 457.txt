" What should we do?" The crowd instinctively turned their gazes toward Li Tianxiao, whose face was equally grim.

"I don't know what to do!" Li Tianxiao mentally cursed, his mind momentarily stunned.

As the group fumbled for solutions, Luotian's figure slowly ascended from the cliff's base to the mountain's peak. His gaze, laced with mockery, locked onto Li Tianxiao and his companions.

"You've chosen an excellent location!" Luotian stood opposite them, then extended a hand. A golden hand shot forth from his palm, its overwhelming aura causing Li Tianxiao's group to stagger.

"I am a disciple of the Disordered Heaven Sect. My grandfather is a sect elder. You cannot kill me!" Yao Qishui shouted, revealing his connections.

"What is the Disordered Heaven Sect? I've never heard of it!" Luotian lightly shook his head. The golden hand remained undeterred, swiftly approaching Li Tianxiao's group.

Chapter 1774: Yao Qishui's Tactics

"It's too late!" Luotian sneered. He had witnessed countless such scenarios; those who escaped today would inevitably return to seek vengeance.

"Boom..." The golden hand descended, and at a distance of several dozen feet from Li Tianxiao's group, two Heavenly Dao Realm cultivators collapsed under the pressure, disintegrating into blood mist that scattered across the mountain peak.

"I'll fight you!" Li Tianxiao roared, realizing Luotian intended no mercy. His body trembled as the golden hand suffocated him. He swiftly drew a golden pill from his sleeve and swallowed it without hesitation.

As the elixir entered his body, waves of energy radiated from Li Tianxiao. His aura surged abruptly.

"Buzz..." Yao Qishui's body emitted a humming sound, and a jade pendant rose from his person, emitting radiant light that shielded him and his companions.

"Boom..." As the radiance flared, the golden hand collided with the emerald barrier.

A thunderous sound echoed as the emerald barrier shattered under the golden hand's might, dispersing into whirlwinds that battered the group.

"Spit..." Meanwhile, besides Li Tianxiao and Li Haoran, Yao Qishui's group spat blood, their faces pale.

"Unfathomable disparity!" Ji Dongyang trembled internally, fear etched in his gaze as he stared at Luotian.

"Damn it, I should have anticipated this! Earlier in the Heavenly Yuan Sect, his single attack severed my arm!" Ji Dongyang's regret was profound. Though he knew Luotian was powerful, he hadn't expected him to ascend to the Heavenly Immortal Realm.

"A single light punch sent those Heavenly Dao cultivators spitting blood, and two died!" The crowd watched Luotian standing atop Xiu Long Mountain, their eyes filled with reverence.

"This is the difference between a Heavenly Immortal and a Heavenly Dao cultivator! In front of a Heavenly Immortal, a Heavenly Dao cultivator is but an ordinary mortal!" Long Li's eyes gleamed with admiration as he spoke.

"Three city lords, who was mistaken this time?" Long Youran's face bore triumph as he gazed at Zhang Kuangfeng and the others, their expressions like wilted eggplants.

Their minds reeled in terror. Upon hearing Long Youran's words, they recalled their bet: one hundred spiritual stones. For them, parting with this sum was arduous after being ruthlessly exploited by Luotian.

Though they wished to cheat, the sight of Luotian atop the mountain forced them to bite their pride.

"Boom..." As people marveled, a thunderous sound erupted again atop the mountain, drawing their attention to what seemed an inevitable battle.

"Li Tianxiao!" The source of the disturbance revealed itself: Li Tianxiao, his aura blazing, radiating immense power. His aura mirrored Luotian's—both were Heavenly Immortal-level.

"Has Li Tianxiao ascended to the Heavenly Immortal Realm?" The crowd murmured, but soon shook their heads. Though Li Tianxiao's aura was formidable, it felt unstable, his face unusually ruddy.

"It's the elixir—his cultivation surged temporarily!" Long Li observed Li Tianxiao's ascendant aura.

"A temporary ascent to the Heavenly Immortal Realm?" Luotian's smile remained, his gaze on Li Tianxiao unbothered. He knew the gap between this elixir-induced state and his own was insurmountable, and such a condition wouldn't last long.

Luotian's feet rippled with energy, vanishing from view before reappearing in front of Li Tianxiao. He lunged with a punch.

"Get out!" Though Li Tianxiao briefly reached the Heavenly Immortal Realm, facing Luotian still filled him with dread. Yet he no longer faced complete helplessness, countering with a punch.

Golden fists collided, thunderous echoes resounding. In an instant, Li Tianxiao's body was hurled backward.

"Kill!" After felling Li Tianxiao, Luotian extended his hand, and the Divine King's Nine Heavens Map soared forth. The colossal divine map bore immense pressure, charging toward Li Haoran and the others.

"Unite your strength to block it!" Li Haoran shouted, sensing the map's might. Only together did they have a chance to withstand it.

"Buzz..." Energy waves erupted from their hands, converging above Li Haoran and Yao Qishui.

"Crack..." Yet their combined barrier was as fragile as paper against the Divine King's Nine Heavens Map. The barrier was pierced, crushing Li Haoran and his group.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." Blood mist erupted, shaking Xiu Long Mountain as dust obscured the view.

"Two left?" Luotian furrowed his brow, sensing two remaining lifelines within the mist.

"You dare kill me!" Yao Qishui's frantic voice echoed, revealing his and Li Haoran's disheveled forms as the mist cleared.

"One strike eliminated five Heavenly Dao cultivators!" The crowd watched the mountain peak, now reduced to three figures. Ji Dongyang and others had been turned into blood mist, staining Xiu Long Mountain's peak crimson.

"Divine Water Killing Immortal Talisman!" Yao Qishui shouted, drawing a golden talisman from his sleeve. It emitted powerful energy, its surface resonating with flowing water before a golden river surged toward Luotian.

"This is my grandfather's talisman—equivalent to a Heavenly Immortal's initial strike!"

"I have more!" Yao Qishui, unsettled by the river, waved his hand again. A golden divine sword erupted from his palm, its surface etched with intricate seals. It soared above him before vanishing.

"I have more!" Yao Qishui continued waving, unleashing attacks as if they were worthless. Each strike rivaled a Heavenly Immortal's power.

"Damn, he's so rich!" The crowd marveled at the relentless assaults. A single talisman was an invaluable treasure for the five city lords.

Unbeknownst to them, after Yao Qishui's near-death experience, his grandfather had spent immense resources outfitting him. Even a Heavenly Immortal would bleed against these tactics.

"Red Blood Ascending to Heaven!" Meanwhile, Li Tianxiao, regaining his breath, unleashed a desperate attack. His hands moved rapidly, spitting out old blood that transformed into a crimson dragon, charging toward Luotian.

"Boom..." Xiu Long Mountain trembled violently as waves of powerful martial arts filled the peak, leaving Luotian no room to dodge.

"Troublesome!" Luotian muttered, sensing the terrifying martial arts that posed a challenge.

"But merely troublesome!" He then surged with might, leaping toward the onslaught.

"Great Dao Sealing Demon... Sky-Blocking Seal..." Luotian unleashed a barrage of powerful attacks, clashing with the martial arts.

"Leave quickly!" Li Tianxiao shouted at Li Haoran and Yao Qishui, watching Luotian engulfed by the martial arts.

"Boom... Boom..." Luotian, like an undefeated war god, shattered each attack. Li Tianxiao knew they couldn't withstand Luotian anymore.

"Go!" Yao Qishui nodded, his wealth and arrogance aside. He wasn't foolish; as long as he lived, there was hope. If he returned to the Disordered Heaven Sect, Luotian would inevitably meet his end—his grandfather was a late-stage Heavenly Immortal.

"You're all really annoying! If I'd known he was a Heavenly Immortal, I would've brought several with me. There wouldn't have been so many problems!" Yao Qishui spoke, then leaped off Xiu Long Mountain.

But in his haste, he miscalculated, tumbling down the peak—comically absurd.

"You too, go! I'll hold him back! Remember to avenge me and your father! Don't return to the Li family!" Li Tianxiao urged Li Haoran.

"Grandfather!" Li Haoran's face contorted with madness, recalling how Li Tianxiao had treated him like a grandson. Without Li Tianxiao, Li Haoran might still be a spoiled brat.

Even after joining the Tremendous Immortal Sect, Li Haoran remained a half-baked disciple but had become more disciplined. Yet he was still an underling within the sect.

"From now on, you must rely on yourself! You've grown up!" Li Tianxiao shouted before pushing Li Haoran off the mountain peak.

In an instant, Li Haoran tumbled down the mountain, gazing at the old man atop Xiu Long Mountain whose aura surged.

"I Li Haoran swear today: I will kill Luotian!" Li Haoran shouted, then dashed away under the crowd's watchful eyes.

"Now it's my turn!" Seeing Yao Qishui and Li Haoran escape, Li Tianxiao smiled. He watched Luotian, who had felled a golden river, his form slightly battered. Li Tianxiao dashed toward him with madness.

"Damn it!" Luotian's face darkened, surprised that two had escaped. He hadn't anticipated Yao Qishui's many tactics to hinder him.

"Finish the old man; that Yao Qishui must not be left alive!" Luotian, seeing Li Tianxiao charging, ignored his injuries and lunged toward him.

Chapter 1775: Failure

"Block it!" Li Tianxiao roared, charging toward Luotian. He knew his fate was sealed but aimed to delay Luotian, buying time for Li Haoran and Yao Qishui to escape. If they escaped, Luotian would eventually meet his end.

"Boom!" In an instant, the two clashed, thunderous echoes resounding atop Xiu Long Mountain. The crowd below watched with excitement.

"A Heavenly Immortal battle—our five cities haven't seen such in years!" The crowd murmured, but the outcome was one-sided; Luotian utterly dominated Li Tianxiao.

"Boom... Boom..." The peak rained debris as Luotian relentlessly punched, his Banishing King's Martial Arts unfolding. Each strike caused Li Tianxiao to spit blood, leaving injuries that couldn't be repaired in time.

"Not enough!" Luotian mused; though killing Li Tianxiao was a matter of time, he wanted to chase Yao Qishui and Li Haoran.

"End it!" Luotian spoke softly, the Sky-Rending Spear materializing in his hand. He bent slightly before vanishing from Li Tianxiao's sight.

"Block it!" As Luotian disappeared, Li Tianxiao felt a life-threatening crisis. His body chilled as if a cold blade pressed against his neck.

Li Tianxiao roared, his body radiating heat. His aged eyes flashed madness; he knew he couldn't withstand Luotian's might. After the prolonged battle, his elixir had nearly depleted, leaving him weak.

"True Dragon's Nine Heavens!" Li Tianxiao wasn't naive; he aimed to deliver a final, fatal strike by burning his cultivation and life force.

"Roar..." Next moment, Li Tianxiao moved, his body enveloped by crimson energy forming a blood dragon. He charged toward where he sensed Luotian's presence.

"Crash..." Stones on the ground were lifted by the blood dragon, its powerful aura instilling fear.

"This strike cost him everything! This is Li Family's secret technique; after this, Li Tianxiao won't survive!" Long Li watched Li Tianxiao's overwhelming aura. He hadn't expected the renowned Li Tianxiao, a second-tier immortal cultivator, to perish.

"Buzz..." A tearing aura rose atop Xiu Long Mountain as Luotian appeared seemingly out of nowhere. The golden Sky-Rending Spear pierced the blood dragon with relentless force, slicing it apart inch by inch.

Blood mist obscured the view as Luotian and Li Tianxiao vanished from sight.

Within the blood mist, the golden spear pierced Li Tianxiao's heart. His aura rapidly waned, his life force dwindling. His eyes felt leaden, drooping involuntarily.

"Victory and defeat are inevitable. But you won't fare well either; my nephew, Yao Qishui, will avenge me. As long as you remain in the Lower Heavens, you'll inevitably die with me!" Li Tianxiao spoke haltingly, his voice fading until the final word. His eyes closed slowly, a surge of energy emanating from his body as he was torn apart by sharp forces.

"Go..." Luotian didn't heed Li Tianxiao's words, watching him die before vanishing into the blood mist. He stood in view of the crowd.

"It's Luotian!"

"Did Li Tianxiao... die?" The crowd, though prepared, was stunned. After all, Li Tianxiao's name had echoed through the five cities for centuries.

"All things have souls!" Luotian stood atop the sky, ignoring their awe as he gazed at Xiu Long Mountain's wreckage. He extended a hand, retrieving a broken talisman from the ground—Yao Qishui's Heavenly Water Killing Immortal Talisman.

The broken talisman was tiny, no larger than a fingernail. Unless closely observed, it would be overlooked. This was the talisman Yao Qishui had used earlier.

Luotian pinched it, reducing it to ash that drifted on his fingertips.

"Seek your master!" Luotian spoke softly, leaving the crowd puzzled. At that moment, he seemed to be speaking to himself.

His gaze revealed a faint wisp of gray smoke swirling on his fingertips.

"Buzz..." A subtle ripple emanated from his fingertip, and Luotian's body followed the ripple toward Xiu Long Mountain's southeast—Yao Qishui's escape route.

"Is he going to chase Yao Qishui?" The crowd wondered, watching Luotian gradually disappear. They hadn't expected him to pursue Yao Qishui.

"Three city lords, shall we settle our bet?" Long Youran's face bore triumph as he gazed at Zhang Kuangfeng, Zhang Lie, and Sun Luoshan.

"Ugh..." Upon hearing Long Youran's words, their faces darkened. Yet they reluctantly handed over one hundred spiritual stones to Long Youran.

"The five cities' balance will shift!" All eyes turned to Long Li and his group. With Li Tianxiao's death, the remaining Li family members in Xiu Long City couldn't control it.

"We won't contest with you for Xiu Long City!" Long Youran, seeing Zhang Kuangfeng and others still lingering, understood their unspoken thoughts. He addressed them:

"Thank you, Young Lady Youran!" Upon hearing Long Youran's words, Zhang Kuangfeng and others' faces brightened. Their three cities had been weakened; Xiu Long City was a prime target they all wanted to claim. Yet with Luotian's presence, they dared not act.

"Hah! You seem overly pleased," Long Li sneered, dousing their excitement with a cold bucket of water. Their faces shifted instantly.

Indeed, though the Heavenly Yuan Sect wouldn't contest, it didn't mean Long Li wouldn't. And now, with his strong ties to Luotian, he was in a powerful position.

Long Li's words made their faces shift slightly. Xiu Long City was too lucrative, the top among the five cities; they couldn't bear to give it up.

"Long Li, let's compete fairly. You know our sects also have influences; let's split Xiu Long City evenly among the four cities!" Zhang Kuangfeng addressed Long Li, his tone conciliatory.

"Fine, you take four parts," Zhang Kuangfeng and others reluctantly agreed, as Long Li's words were true. One Luotian was enough to suppress them.

Meanwhile, Luotian followed the aura through the sky toward Yao Qishui's direction.

"Fast runner," he mused after an hour, finally spotting Yao Qishui—a ball-like figure fleeing.

"Damn it!" Yao Qishui fled, sensing a powerful aura behind him. He knew Luotian had caught up.

"Why are you chasing me?" Yao Qishui shouted, legs accelerating as he fought for his life. His speed increased slightly, surprising Luotian.

"You're a disciple of the Disordered Heaven Sect; you'll face consequences!" Yao Qishui's cries echoed, drawing the crowd's surprise.

"Disordered Heaven Sect... Yao Qishui!" The crowd's faces shifted; everyone in the Lower Heavens knew of the Disordered Heaven Sect. They hadn't expected anyone to dare attack a disciple.

"A Heavenly Immortal!" Soon, the crowd saw Luotian streaking toward Yao Qishui.

Though Yao Qishui's speed was fast, Luotian's was faster. The distance between them narrowed.

"Daring rogue! How dare you impersonate a disciple of the Disordered Heaven Sect and tarnish its honor!" Luotian shouted while chasing.

"Ah, I see! That's why someone dared attack a disciple of the Disordered Heaven Sect—because it was an impersonator!" The crowd understood.

"Shameless!" Yao Qishui felt like vomiting, having heard his claim of being a disciple. Some people had already turned against him with mockery.

"Ten thousand feet... eight thousand feet..." The distance between Luotian and Yao Qishui lessened, causing Yao Qishui's fear to peak.

"Three thousand feet..." For Luotian, this distance would take less than ten breaths.

"Big Brother, stay safe and don't return!" As Luotian was about to catch Yao Qishui, a weak voice echoed in his ears. This voice belonged to Zhao Dahu, the first person he met upon arriving in the Immortal Realm.

"Dahu..." Luotian waved his hand, a token appearing. He called out to the token. Hearing Zhao Dahu's voice, Luotian felt a hammer pounding his heart, making his face pale.

"The Heavenly Immortal stopped!" The crowd watched Luotian standing in the sky, his face pale. They didn't know why.

"Don't chase?" Seeing Luotian stop, Yao Qishui rejoiced, accelerating further.

"Return!" Luotian ignored the fleeing Yao Qishui and suddenly turned, pushing his speed to maximum toward the Heavenly Yuan Sect.

A sense of panic surged through Luotian's mind. Though he'd been in the Immortal Realm briefly and had spent little time with the Heavenly Yuan Sect's people, he'd grown close to them. He thought of their recent interactions.

Especially Zhao Dahu and Zhao Erniu, who were close to him and respected him. In Luotian's heart, they were already his brothers.

"Don't be harmed... don't be harmed!" Luotian muttered, his body radiating a violent aura. This aura made him appear terrifying.

"Boom... Boom..." The sky darkened, mirroring Luotian's mood.

"It's going to rain; the five cities haven't seen rain in a long time!" The crowd watched the darkened sky, then saw a streak of light cutting through the dimming heavens.

"Crash... Crash..." Raindrops fell, pounding Luotian's body. After flying for half an hour, he reached the Heavenly Yuan Sect's airspace.

As he arrived, a heavy scent of blood invaded his senses, making his face pale further.

The entire Heavenly Yuan Sect was in ruins, its camp filled with corpses. The rain continuously washed over them, dyeing the sect red with blood.

In the camp, corpses lay in the rain, their familiar faces appearing before Luotian's eyes.

"Dahu... Erniu..." Luotian found Zhao Dahu and Zhao Erniu among the corpses.

He lifted them, but his touch found only coldness, making his heart freeze.

"Spit..." Luotian spat black blood, tears streaming down his eyes. He hadn't cried in thousands of years, but now he wept.

"I was going to improve your strength!" Luotian roared, unable to believe that after just half a day away, the Heavenly Yuan Sect's seven hundred people had been slaughtered to death. The method was cruel, leaving no one with a complete body.

"Not a single soul... none left!" Luotian murmured, recalling his last conversation with them. Their laughter and drinking still echoed in his ears. Zhao Erniu's unique stammered voice was still fresh.

"Big Brother... return and help me refine the Breaking Heaven Pill; I want to reach the Heavenly Dao Realm..."

"Big Brother, once you become a Heavenly Immortal, can we truly establish a sect?" Their familiar voices echoed in Luotian's ears.

"Come back!" Luotian roared, clenching his fists and pounding the ground with thunderous sounds. Yet only raindrops fell; no response came.

"It was my fault!" Luotian stood up, gazing at the corpses on the ground.

"Zhu Fengtian!" Luotian spoke each word clearly. He knew it was Zhu Fengtian; in the Immortal Realm, he had few enemies capable of this. Only Zhu Fengtian could silently destroy the Heavenly Yuan Sect.

"With my blood... reverse... time..." Luotian's eyes turned red as he stood, spitting out golden blood.

He waved his hands, divine laws emerging from them, inscribed into the golden blood.

"Buzz..." The golden blood ignited violently, emitting strange waves that enveloped the camp.

The waves spread, and Luotian's surroundings transformed into the Heavenly Yuan Sect before its destruction. At that time, he was battling Li Tianxiao atop Xiu Long Mountain.

The camp's people discussed Luotian's duel with Li Tianxiao, unaware of the impending doom. Since their strength was limited, Luotian hadn't taken anyone to Xiu Long Mountain.

"You say our Big Brother is so mighty!" A strongman's face bore admiration.

"Don't call him Big Brother anymore; the title should change to Sect Leader. We're now a sect!" A bandit interrupted.

"But the Sect Leader is far stronger than Zhu Fengtian. Zhu Fengtian didn't even give us a drop of soup, but the Sect Leader promised to refine elixirs for us!" The crowd murmured, clearly confident in Luotian. They imagined their future lives.

Yet, as they discussed, the apocalypse arrived. Two figures descended from the sky, standing atop the Heavenly Yuan Sect.

"Hey! There's someone in the sky!" As they arrived, the sect's people noticed them.

"Sky... Heavenly Immortal!" The camp erupted in chaos, gathering together. Years of knife-edge survival made them sense these two weren't passing by but had come specifically for the Heavenly Yuan Sect.

"Li Tianxiao... confirm it's here?" The bloodied figure looked at the bandits, addressing his companion in a tattered yellow robe.

The two were Zhu Fengtian's blood-slaughtering disciples and the youth Li Tianxiao met in a tavern—Liang Tian Guang.

"Yes, it's here. I searched for a long time. I felt uneasy when the Sect Leader ascended to the Heavenly Immortal Realm," Liang Tian Guang smiled, addressing the blood-slaughtering disciple.

"Then let's attack. He seems to have gone on a duel today!" The blood-slaughtering disciple licked his crimson lips, then lunged toward the Heavenly Yuan Sect's people without hesitation.

His blood-red sword glowed with a sinister light, slicing through several Heavenly Yuan Sect members. Heads fell instantly.

Liang Tian Guang also attacked, standing in the sky as he waved his hands. Stones rained down from above, crashing onto the Heavenly Yuan Sect's people.

Two Heavenly Immortals' attacks were beyond what the Heavenly Yuan Sect could withstand. Within minutes, the sect became a battlefield of horrors, with seven hundred people slaughtered by the blood-slaughtering disciple and Liang Tian Guang.

Yet they acted as if it were a trivial task, walking through the sect to find its treasure vault. There, they discovered an old token with rusted markings and a ghost character etched on it.

"Indeed here!" Liang Tian Guang ignored the other treasures and carefully took the token.

"Let's go!" Liang Tian Guang told the blood-slaughtering disciple, then they flew out of the Heavenly Yuan Sect, leaving behind corpses.

"Blood-slaughtering disciple... Liang Tian Guang..." The scene dissolved, and Luotian returned to the cold camp. His face was pale as a sheet, but his eyes were blood-red.

"Whoever you are, I'll make you pay with your blood!" Luotian's fingers turned white as he waved his hands again. Waves erupted from his palms, and a black mountain—his fused soul mountain and magnetic mountain—descended.

"Comrades, return!" Luotian roared before the black mountain absorbed the gray souls.

"Buzz..." Gray mist drifted through the sky, gradually coalescing into a shadow that flew toward the black mountain.

"Seal!" Luotian pointed, invisible waves radiating from his hand, enveloping the soul. It solidified slightly before hovering in front of him.

"Comrades, lead me to your enemies; I'll avenge you!" Luotian addressed the shadows before the black mountain absorbed them.

Waves echoed as the black mountain slowly lifted, flying toward the Heavenly Yuan Sect's southern direction.

Luotian's face was pale; he felt weak. This reverse-time technique was a recent breakthrough after ascending to the Heavenly Immortal Realm. In the Nine Realms, he could easily witness past events, but in the Immortal Realm, it was impossible.

His unique constitution allowed him to instinctively master this method upon becoming a Heavenly Immortal, though it was exhausting.

As the black mountain soared, Luotian didn't hesitate. He took out several elixirs and swallowed them, then waved his hand, releasing seven-colored flames that ignited the camp.

Towering seven-colored flames rapidly consumed the camp, even drying raindrops before they could fall.

Steam surrounded the mountain peak as Luotian gazed at it, whispering: "Comrades, I'm sorry. Once I find those two, I'll personally send you to reincarnation!"

Chapter 1776: Entering the Apocalypse

Apocalypse Forest, a perilous zone of the five cities. Its outer regions weren't dangerous. When Luotian first arrived in the Immortal Realm, he had landed at its edge, escaping with Zhao Dahu and Zhao Erniu. They'd slain Zhu Fengtian, renaming the Fire-Blazing Sect to the Heavenly Yuan Sect.

"Buzz..." An endless forest's sky echoed with waves as a black mountain slowly flew, surrounded by gray mist.

A white figure stood before the mountain, his eyes blood-red, face pale, and aura filled with killing intent.

"Boom..." The black mountain crashed down, and the white figure descended into the forest.

"Here?" A hoarse voice echoed as Luotian gazed toward the forest's depths, guided by the souls. He'd flown around the outer regions of Apocalypse Forest for a day but hadn't found the blood-slaughtering disciple and Liang Tian Guang.

"Have you entered?" Luotian stood in the forest, which felt like a boundary. The black mountain circled but dared not enter.

Luotian too felt an ominous danger within, even risking his life.

"I'll send you off first!" Luotian whispered, determined to scour the forest for those two. Otherwise, it would haunt him forever. If he didn't kill them, he'd never forgive himself.

"Reverse Time..." He punched, creating a gray passage. Waves radiated from the massive passage.

"Is this reverse-time passage truly leading to endless hell?" Luotian's first time using the reverse-time punch in the Immortal Realm. He'd thought he couldn't create it here, but now he realized his underestimation of the passage's power.

"Comrades, farewell!" Luotian's pale face spoke to the gray souls on the black mountain.

"Roar..." A low growl echoed, as if bidding farewell. The souls were drawn into the passage by its suction.

"Goodbye. If there's hell or an afterlife, I hope you live well!" Luotian whispered.

In the Nine Realms, he might have found a way to nurture their souls, but in the Immortal Realm, he truly had no solution.

"Now, it's time for revenge!" The gray passage gradually vanished from Luotian's sight. His blood-red eyes flashed with killing intent as he stepped into the forest's depths.
