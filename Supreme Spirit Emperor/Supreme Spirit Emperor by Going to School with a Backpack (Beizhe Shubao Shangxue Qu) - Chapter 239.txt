The sound of a bowstring snapped through the air, causing the old man's eyes to flicker with despair. Before he and his companion could react, a dark light emerged from the golden lightning sea—exceptionally conspicuous. In an instant, it materialized before the old man.

"Ahh..." The old man's face bore terror as he attempted to block, but it was too late. Moreover, he had already been severely wounded by the Shangtian Bow. Now, he was merely a fading ember.

"Boom..." Under the force of this arrow, the old man could no longer endure. Not even a mist of blood formed before he was annihilated by the black storm.

Two arrows had slain a Late Stage Saint—this was the terrifying might of Luo Tian and the Pseudo Epoch Treasure. It left everyone in awe.

"Finished..." The remaining Late Stage Saint's face bore shock, his gaze vacant. Now that he was the sole Late Stage Saint left, he had no hope of defeating Luo Tian.

The lightning sea dissipated. Beneath the Epoch Bell, Luo Tian's face was pale as death. He coughed violently, blood spewing uncontrollably from his mouth. His entire body emitted a series of cracking sounds—evidently, the final strike had left him severely wounded.

"Hah... now it's your turn!" Luo Tian panted heavily, each breath releasing a surge of thunderous power from his mouth.

At this moment, Luo Tian felt his condition was at its worst. If not for the Divine Medicine sustaining him, he would have no strength left to fight. Divine Medicine was worth a life.

"Crack..." Without hesitation or regret, Luo Tian withdrew another Divine Medicine and began chewing it hungrily. The previous one had been used to fire three arrows, leaving all its potency to mend his internal organs and flesh.

"Damn it... this kid must have stolen the Epoch Lord's treasure, how does he have so many Divine Medicines!" The remaining Late Stage Saint's face darkened. He had just seen Luo Tian in such a pitiful state, thinking he might have a chance—but now, Luo Tian produced another Divine Medicine. This left the old man despairing.

"Run!" The old man knew he could do nothing against Luo Tian. His only option was to flee. As for the others in the Thunder Domain, he cared little—his life was more important.

"Old dog! If you had attacked me from the start, not giving me time to refine the Divine Medicine, I might have already died!" Luo Tian saw the old man fleeing and laughed instead of being angry. He reached for his Shangtian Bow again, aiming at the fleeing golden lightning.

"Die!" Luo Tian roared, his voice brimming with overwhelming power. Even the battlefield trembled.

The black magic arrow appeared like a second reaper, instantly materializing behind the fleeing Late Stage Saint.

Chapter 1036: Li Cheng'en's Return

Under boundless skies, a golden lightning streaked across the heavens, followed by a black arrow. The two moved at breakneck speed.

Beneath these two lights, the vast battlefield echoed with thunderous roars. No one noticed the two streaks slicing through the sky, for even a moment's distraction meant certain death.

"Damn it... Ahh..." The Late Stage Saint moved at lightning speed, his face twisted with madness as he let out a series of desperate cries.

In an era without any Epoch-level masters, a Late Stage Saint was already a titanic power. Now, being forced into such a desperate situation by another Late Stage Saint was unbearable.

"Old dog! Die!" Luo Tian roared again, his voice cold as he nocked another magic arrow. The black light flashed once more, and another magic arrow shot from Luo Tian's hand.

Two dark lights sealed the fate of the Late Stage Saint, who knew he was doomed. One arrow might have allowed him to resist, but two—just like his companion before him.

"Boom..." Under the old man's despairing gaze, two dark lights struck his back and pierced into his body.

Demon energy surged. The powerful force instantly annihilated the old man. A Late Stage Saint had finally fallen, marking that only one remained in the Thunder Domain.

Luo Tian exhaled deeply. His gaze turned to the other side of the battlefield. With numerical superiority, the Four Sacred Star Domains had taken the initiative. Though there were casualties, they far outmatched the Thunder Domain. Victory was merely a matter of time—though he could not yet concern himself with the cost.

"Kill!" On the other side, Zhang Ziping and others intercepted the remaining Late Stage Saint. His face was grim. He had not expected Luo Tian to truly eliminate his two companions. Though he currently held Zhang Ziping and others at bay, it was clear they could not be defeated immediately. With the Lingyun Cauldron, Zhang Ziping's group focused on defense rather than offense.

Zhang Ziping and others wore smiles, sensing Luo Tian had eliminated the two Late Stage Saints. Their eyes held admiration.

At this moment, they were clashing with a single Late Stage Saint. They knew the true terror of a Late Stage Saint. Without the Lingyun Cauldron, they might have already suffered casualties.

"Pseudo Epoch Treasure... it's so powerful!" People marveled, watching Luo Tian beneath the Epoch Bell. He drew his Shangtian Bow again, aiming at the Late Stage Saint they faced.

"Die too!" Luo Tian growled, and a black magic arrow shot forth, piercing the Late Stage Saint's body.

No surprise. The Late Stage Saint immediately turned into a mist of blood, slowly reforming his body.

"Haha!" Seeing the blood mist coalescing, Zhang Ziping and others launched their final assault. A series of powerful martial arts techniques erupted from their hands, annihilating the blood mist in a storm of techniques.

"Eliminated!" Zhang Ziping and others wore expressions of excitement. With three Late Stage Saints eliminated, the war would surely be won by the Four Sacred Star Domains.

On the other side of the battlefield, Lu Xiong and Sha Cangmang faced two opponents each. They already held the upper hand.

With three Late Stage Saints eliminated, the Thunder Domain's Late Stage and Early Stage masters felt despair. How could they fight? Their numbers were double, but it was sheer碾压 with no chance of victory.

"Boom... boom..." Thunderous roars echoed through the stars. One by one, the Thunder Domain's Late Stage masters fell under Sha Cangmang, Lu Xiong, and Wei Mingxuan's attacks.

Luo Tian stood beneath the stars, exhaling deeply. He addressed Zhang Ziping and others: "I need to heal!"

After speaking, he sat cross-legged beneath the stars. A green glow radiated from his body, surrounding him with dense vitality.

"Rest easy!" Zhang Ziping laughed loudly, confidence in his voice. Without the Late Stage Saints, none of them feared anyone.

"Kill!" Zhang Ziping led the charge again, attacking the Thunder Domain's Late Stage masters. Others quickly found their opponents.

With Zhang Ziping's group joining, the Thunder Domain's dozens of Late Stage masters were annihilated within half a day. The Four Sacred Star Domains' cost was twenty Late Stage masters from various sects, who vanished completely.

"Victory is near! Haha!" Sha Cangmang and others felt pain at their sect's masters' deaths, but they were happy for the impending victory. They knew from today forward, the Four Sacred Star Domains would echo throughout the Nine Domains. The Thunder Domain had gathered nearly ten million to attack, a major event. Other domains' sacred clans would surely watch this war. Anyone wishing to oppose the Four Sacred Star Domains would have to weigh their strength.

"Kill..." Lu Xiong and others, without a moment's respite, appeared in the battlefield of the Transcendent and Supreme stages. Each strike felled countless Thunder Domain warriors.

"Seven million... five million... three million..." The Thunder Domain's numbers plummeted at a terrifying speed, leaving them desperate. They knew they had lost. Late Stage masters could change the entire battlefield's outcome.

They had no Late Stage masters left. Originally, hundreds of millions against a million was already struggling to hold on. Now with the Four Sacred Star Domains' Late Stage masters joining, how could they resist?

"One million..." When the Thunder Domain's numbers dwindled to one million, they were surrounded by the Four Sacred Star Domains.

"Roar..." The Four Sacred Star Domains' warriors roared, their eyes blood-red as they stared at the trembling one million Thunder Domain warriors.

Beneath the stars, rivers of blood flowed. Arms and limbs lay scattered everywhere. Everyone was drenched in blood—whether their own or the enemy's.

The Thunder Domain warriors trembled, gazing at the countless people surrounding them. Their faces paled as they saw the entire sky painted blood-red.

Hundreds of millions, lasting three days. With the Four Sacred Star Domains' losses, over ten million had vanished from the world. The horror of war was self-evident.

"Surrender! We surrender!" One million cried in unison, no longer having the courage to fight. They chose to surrender.

"Surrender! When you slaughtered our Four Sacred Star Domains' continental sects, did you ever think of this day!" Sha Cangmang spoke coldly. The old tortoise of Xuanwu bore a sorrowful expression. Hundreds of millions of Xuanwu Sect disciples had been on his back, but now only two remained.

"Kill... kill... kill... kill into the Thunder Domain and avenge!" The Four Sacred Star Domains' warriors went mad. Those who had died at the hands of these one million Thunder Domain warriors were certainly not compensated by their numbers.

Each warrior of the Four Sacred Star Domains seemed mad, instantly submerging the one million in a flood.

"Kill!" After this battle, nearly ten million Thunder Domain cultivators who had invaded the Four Sacred Star Domains were left behind in the Four Sacred Star Domains. Only one severely wounded Late Stage master, Li Cheng'en, remained.

Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes. A look of admiration flickered in them as he gazed at the countless blood-stained warriors of the Four Sacred Star Domains.

Though the Thunder Domain's people were annihilated, the Four Sacred Star Domains' losses were also significant. Countless continents and sects had been destroyed. This battle had cost the Four Sacred Star Domains four to five million lives, a heart-wrenching loss.

"Luo Tian!" The warriors of the Four Sacred Star Domains gazed at Luo Tian with fervor. He had single-handedly eliminated four Late Stage Saints.

"Clean up the battlefield!" Luo Tian spoke slowly, his voice heavy with exhaustion. He gazed at the endless corpses—nearly ten million dead.

"I wonder what it was like when the Nether Domain caused chaos across the Nine Domains!" Luo Tian shook his head lightly, murmuring to himself.

The warriors of the Four Sacred Star Domains naturally obeyed Luo Tian's orders, beginning to clean up the battlefield. But as they just started moving, a terrifying fluctuation suddenly appeared beneath the stars, turning everyone's gazes into fear.

"Ahh... you all are going to die!" A voice filled with fury echoed beneath the stars. A pale figure tore through the sky, instantly appearing in their sight.

White robes and a white aura. Ethereal and divine, golden lightning surrounded him. Li Cheng'en's face bore endless killing intent as he stood beneath the stars, his hand striking out. Golden lightning coalesced into a mountain-like palm, instantly smashing into the crowd.

"Boom..." Blood mist surged. Over ten thousand of the Four Sacred Star Domains' warriors were annihilated in this single strike. The might of a Late Stage master was evident.

"Li Cheng'en!" Luo Tian's face suddenly changed, gazing at the towering Li Cheng'en. He hadn't expected him to recover so quickly.

"Run!" Luo Tian shouted at the group, instantly appearing before Li Cheng'en. His eyes flashed with cold light.

"Kid, you've provoked me repeatedly. This time I'll kill you—no one can save you! Even Cao Yuanshan, with his immense power, wouldn't have time to come from the Demon Domain!" Li Cheng'en was thoroughly enraged. His eyes blood-red, his hand凝聚 again without hesitation, striking toward Luo Tian.

"Run! Don't worry about me!" Luo Tian's body trembled as he shouted, the Epoch Bell covering him. He made no move to escape because he wanted to give the Four Sacred Star Domains time to reclaim Tianyuan Continent. He also didn't want so many people to witness his secret.

Chapter 1037: Transmission

Under the boundless stars of the Four Sacred Star Domains, vast stretches of space slowly healed. Below it, figures flew toward Tianyuan Continent like meteors.

A golden hand descended from the sky, radiating overwhelming might. People trembled in fear, unable to resist even a moment's defiance—Luo Tian himself stood trembling with terror.

"Can't withstand!" Luo Tian's face was as pale as paper, gazing at the massive hand capable of destroying a star. This was merely Li Cheng'en's casual strike. If he had used his full power, how terrifying would it be?

"Indeed, the might of a Late Stage master is terrifying. This old man's appearance clearly shows he hasn't fully recovered, yet his power is still so terrifying. If he were at full strength, how strong would he be?" Luo Tian trembled internally, his face showing madness.

Luo Tian's hands moved swiftly, forming a series of black seals. The Epoch Bell and Lingyun Cauldron were both summoned above his head, clearly showing he was giving it everything.

The warriors of the Four Sacred Star Domains felt touched by Luo Tian's desperation. They knew they were only a burden here, unable to help. Only Luo Tian with the three Pseudo Epoch Treasures could withstand it.

"Hope he truly has a secret!" People prayed silently, disappearing from Li Cheng'en's sight.

Li Cheng'en didn't chase them. He knew that if he killed Luo Tian, the Four Sacred Star Domains' people would be nothing more than chickens.

"Kid, a mere Late Stage Initial is no match for a Late Stage master. Even with Pseudo Epoch Treasures, you're still an insect before a Late Stage master!" Li Cheng'en's face bore cruel intent. He watched his lightning hand strike the defense of the Epoch Bell and Lingyun Cauldron.

"Crack..." One strike, the entire space seemed to split. The slowly healing stars cracked again.

"Pu..." Luo Tian stood beneath the Epoch Bell and Lingyun Cauldron, feeling his mind like thunder. He was in excruciating pain.

Golden lightning power was blocked by the two Pseudo Epoch Treasures, but it still penetrated through them and struck Luo Tian's body. Pain surged as golden lightning roamed his body, even destroying a third of his soul.

Luo Tian's entire body exploded, half missing. Blood splattered onto the Epoch Bell's surface.

"Indeed, a Pseudo Epoch Treasure can withstand my strike without dying. Unfortunately, it's wasted in your hands!" Li Cheng'en shook his head lightly. He was confident that if he had obtained three Pseudo Epoch Treasures, even a half-step Epoch master like Cao Yuanshan would have had to fight.

Green light spread throughout Luo Tian's body. He mobilized the remaining power of his Divine Medicine, reassembling his half-broken body. His face was still as pale as paper.

As the people who had fled heard the thunderous hum behind them, they paused. Turning around, they gazed at the exploding stars and the waves striking their bodies. Their hearts grew even more worried about Luo Tian.

"Stop gawking! If you want Luo Tian to survive, hurry and go back to Tianyuan Continent!" Nan Gong Yuqing and Zheng Xin knew Luo Tian had people from the Ancient Heaven Palace. They shouted at everyone, knowing only when these people were far away could Luo Tian use his secret. If others discovered it, Luo Tian would be hunted again. Then he'd have to stay in the Ancient Heaven Palace for years.

Hearing Nan Gong Yuqing's shouts, the Four Sacred Star Domains' people gritted their teeth and ran madly without looking back toward Tianyuan Continent.

"Kid, can you withstand it once? Can you withstand it again?" Li Cheng'en remained calm. He knew Luo Tian couldn't escape. This was absolute power disparity. Luo Tian was trapped under his eyes, unable to flee.

In Li Cheng'en's eyes, Luo Tian was already a dead man. But merely killing him wasn't enough for Li Cheng'en—he wanted Luo Tian to suffer endlessly.

"Haha, kid, I'll extract your soul and let it endure the thunderstorms for forty-nine days. Use your reincarnation body's blood to refine a supreme elixir to compensate for my losses!" Li Cheng'en's face twisted with cruelty. Thinking of the Thunder Domain's complete destruction at the cliff and their total defeat, he gritted his teeth.

The Thunder Domain had lost a third of its strength in this small Four Sacred Star Domains. Before leaving, Li Cheng'en had boasted he'd lose only a million people and then move the remaining Thunder Domain masters to attack Fire Domain.

But now, he was left alone. Even a Late Stage master's power couldn't conquer a domain. It was a dream.

"Old dog... do you think my secrets are exhausted?" Luo Tian's pale face looked around. The space was empty, his eyes showing a smile. Each word he spoke brought out blood from his mouth.

"Kid, it's no use. No matter how you defy fate, there's no chance of reversal before absolute power. A Late Stage master is the god in this era without any Epoch masters. I'll kill you—no one but a half-step Epoch master can save you!" Li Cheng'en's hand凝聚 again, striking toward Luo Tian. This strike was carefully controlled to not kill him but reduce his power and force him to regenerate from blood.

"Bzz..." Luo Tian gazed at the sky-shrouding hand, his face still calm. His eyes flashed with brilliance. He held a golden token in his hands, looking at Li Cheng'en with a playful expression.

At the same time, Luo Tian's hands swiftly formed seals. A key-shaped pattern was engraved onto the golden token.

"Hmm?" Upon seeing the token, Li Cheng'en's eyebrows slightly furrowed. His face showed confusion and disbelief that Luo Tian still had a secret.

"Bzz..." A powerful aura rose from the golden token. The humming sound was clear even through the Epoch Bell and Lingyun Cauldron.

"Transmission power?" Li Cheng'en's face showed contempt. He thought Luo Tian was trying to transmit away with the strange token. His hands pointed into the void, summoning lightning to form a massive cage that completely surrounded an area of hundreds of miles.

"I said you can't escape. I've sealed this space. Trying to transmit is just a dream!" Li Cheng'en chuckled, looking confident.

"I never said I was escaping. You'll be the one who escapes soon!" Luo Tian smiled, ignoring the golden hand striking toward him. He continued to activate the Heaven Palace Token.

As Luo Tian activated the Heaven Palace Token, a massive palace echoed with thunder in the void at the border of the Demon Domain and the Divine Beast Domain. Golden light spread everywhere, lighting up the Demon Domain's stars. The ancient Heaven Palace, which had just disappeared, appeared as a shadow in the Demon Domain's stars.

"Finally found it!" Several old men with powerful auras wore expressions of excitement. They gazed at the shadow, tearing through the void and disappearing into it.

"Haha! The Epoch Treasure must belong to us!" A man in white robes held a copper mirror, gazing at the vast Heaven Palace. His steps were lightning-fast, each step covering thousands of miles.

"Whoever's it belongs to, let's fight for it!" The other old men had cold expressions and disappeared from their spots.

In the ancient Heaven Palace, the three副器灵 and the main器灵's faces slightly changed: "Luo Tian is in danger! He activated reverse transmission!"

"Two of you, please!" The main器灵 Meng Yunxiao addressed the old man sitting calmly with a stern gaze, his voice filled with worry.

Eighteen people opened their eyes simultaneously. Their faces showed excitement: "I'll go... I want to see it first... seniority first, I go first!"

"Sit down! None of you can go. Be safe, and let me and the leader go!" A white-haired old man spoke seriously, looking at the black door opening in the hall.

"Go!" The two old men said and vanished into the void, entering the black door.

"The ancient Heaven Palace has exposed itself. Someone wants to take it!" The main器灵's face showed mockery, gazing at the void as if seeing the ten or so old men with immense auras approaching the ancient Heaven Palace.

"Really, they're asking for death. A mere Late Stage master dares to attack the ancient Heaven Palace? They're just tired of living!" The remaining people showed contempt, not taking it seriously. They resumed sitting on the ground.

In the Four Sacred Star Domains, Luo Tian seemed to ignore the hand capable of destroying him. His face was calm as he continued to activate the Heaven Palace Token.

"Kid, are you giving up resistance? Or do you really think I was telling the truth and won't kill you?" Seeing Luo Tian's state, Li Cheng'en felt an inexplicable bad premonition.

"Bzz..." A brown door opened beneath the Epoch Bell. Through the void, two powerful auras were transmitted, making Luo Tian's smile even broader.

"Old dog, I'll play with you today. If your Thunder Domain loses two Late Stage masters, I want to see how long you can still flounder!" Luo Tian's cold voice echoed in the void. Ten thousand golden lights rose from the black door, and two old men stepped out with aged faces, looking at Luo Tian with expressions of admiration.

Chapter 1038: Different Eras

Under the Epoch Bell in the Four Sacred Star Domains, Luo Tian's face was calm. His gaze showed respect as he looked at the two old men stepping out of the black door.

The hand with overwhelming pressure struck toward Luo Tian, but he showed no concern. He knew these two had arrived, and the situation would instantly reverse. Who killed whom was uncertain.

Li Cheng'en's face suddenly changed, gazing at the two old men with white hair. His entire body tensed.

"Late Stage master!" Li Cheng'en immediately sensed their cultivation, his face showing disbelief.

Throughout the Nine Domains, there were only a few Late Stage masters. They all knew each other. Yet he had never seen these two Late Stage masters before.

"Senior, who's attacking you?" A low voice came from one of the old men. Seeing the sky-shrouding hand striking toward them, his eyes flashed with coldness.

"Senior... senior..." Li Cheng'en, who had lived countless years, was stunned by the two old men calling Luo Tian "senior."

Two Late Stage masters were addressing a young man in his early twenties as "senior." This left Li Cheng'en struggling to adapt.

"Get out..." Thunderous voices echoed. Cold words came from the old man's mouth. He extended his hand, and a golden hand shot out, colliding with Li Cheng'en's palm.

"Boom..." Thunderous roars echoed. Their hands collided, and violent waves continuously struck the Epoch Bell's surface.

"Two elders, don't call me that. I really can't bear it!" Luo Tian smiled bitterly and bowed to them, feeling a bit uneasy inside.

"Stop talking. Senior, this old man wants to deal with you? Leave it to me!" One of the old men's face showed battle intent. He stepped out from beneath the Epoch Bell, gazing at the familiar stars around him and taking a deep breath.

"Ah... the atmosphere of the stars, how many years since I last felt it. It's really nostalgic. I guess I'll have to come out more often in the future!" The old man murmured, his face showing a touch of sorrow. He didn't even glance at Li Cheng'en.

"Friend, I don't know your relationship with this kid. Please give us the Thunder Domain a favor. Don't get involved in this matter. I, Li Cheng'en, am willing to be your friends!" Li Cheng'en didn't get angry. He bowed respectfully.

"Li Cheng'en? Hmm, the Thunder Domain... I think I've heard of it. Ah... I remember now. Hmph, I didn't expect you, an old man nearing his end, to be the Li Cheng'en from before!" The old man's face showed a smile as he looked at Li Cheng'en.

"Are you acquainted with me? Who are you?" Li Cheng'en's eyebrows slightly furrowed. His memory had no such figure.

"Ah... don't think about it. You don't know me. When you were a Late Stage master, I was only an Early Stage master. Where would you know me from!" The old man lightly shook his head.

"Unexpectedly, time has changed. You're still a Late Stage master but your vitality is withered and your end is near. I'm at the peak of my Late Stage power. Truly, everything changes!" The old man's voice carried a touch of nostalgia.

"Who are you exactly?" Li Cheng'en felt even more confused, his face showing bewilderment.

"Oh, since you insist on asking, I'll tell you. I was once from the Star-Seeking Domain. My name should have been somewhat famous back then. I'm Zhou Zhanguang!" Zhou Zhanguang shrugged, his face still showing a smile.

"See that person over there? That's my senior, Zeng Tianshou from the Chaos Domain!" Zhou Zhanguang pointed to the old man restoring Luo Tian's injuries, speaking softly.

"Sounds familiar!" Li Cheng'en slightly furrowed his brows, recalling where he had heard their names over the years. Suddenly, Li Cheng'en's face turned pale.

"Star-Seeking Domain Zhou Zhanguang! Chaos Domain Zeng Tianshou! You two are the disciples of the Star-Seeking and Chaos Domains thirty thousand years ago! You're still alive!" Li Cheng'en's face showed disbelief, gazing at Zhou Zhanguang and Zeng Tianshou.

Zhou Zhanguang and Zeng Tianshou were legendary disciples in their era. Li Cheng'en was an older existence than them, but he had heard of their names.

"Haha, I didn't expect that after so many years, you still remember us, the disciples lost to time!" Zhou Zhanguang lightly shook his head, showing an indifferent expression.

"Second elder, why bother with him? Kill him!" Zeng Tianshou's face darkened as he approached, moving Luo Tian to a distance. After all, the battle of Late Stage masters was dangerous for Luo Tian even with the Epoch Bell's protection.

"Haha, this isn't respect for elders, is it? After all, he was the one who could have crushed me with a single palm!" Zhou Zhanguang put aside his childish face, his expression gradually turning cold.

"You!" Li Cheng'en's face completely changed. His injuries hadn't fully healed, and his end was near. His strength would definitely be affected.

But Zhou Zhanguang and Zeng Tianshou were both at the peak of their Late Stage power. The outcome was obvious. Seeing that he had been defeated by these disciples who were once easily crushed by him, Li Cheng'en felt a sense of frustration.

"Quickly finish it!" Zeng Tianshou's face showed impatience, transmitting to Zhou Zhanguang. His body emitted a series of thunderous roars.

"Void Burial Chaos!" Zeng Tianshou showed no hesitation, his hands moving. Gray energy flew from his hands. One hand formed a gray sun, the other a gray moon. With immense power, they pressed toward Li Cheng'en.

"Star-Seeking Chess Spread!" Zhou Zhanguang showed no hesitation, his attack showing no mercy. The sky instantly darkened. The stars around the heavens moved under Zhou Zhanguang's control, emitting an unusual aura throughout the starry sky.

"Indeed, the Chaos and Star-Seeking Domains are the most mysterious. Their martial arts carry a special aura, completely different from the usual green spiritual energy of Late Stage masters!" Luo Tian stood ten thousand feet away, his Epoch Bell still active. After all, it was a battle between Late Stage masters; even being near the edge could be dangerous for his small body.

Li Cheng'en's face immediately darkened. He gazed at their terrifying martial arts, his heart trembling with fear.

"Don't push me!" Zhou Cheng'en's eyes flashed with coldness and madness. His hands moved, thunderous sounds echoing from his palms. Millions of golden lightning bolts surged from his hands.

"Lightning Soul Slash!" Li Cheng'en roared, and the millions of lightning bolts coalesced into a single lightning sword. This was fused with Li Cheng'en's Pseudo Epoch Treasure sword, striking toward the two.

Li Cheng'en's martial arts were already overwhelming. With the Pseudo Epoch Treasure's enhancement, their power increased several times. The violent aura even made Luo Tian feel a sense of awe from afar.

"Indeed, he's a true master who has lived longer than us. His martial arts are so powerful that if it were anyone else, they might not have survived!" Zhou Zhanguang's face showed admiration as he gazed at the golden lightning sword.

"Old man, with the Pseudo Epoch Treasure's enhancement, you can't stop me!" Li Cheng'en's face showed a hint of pride. He gazed at Zhou Zhanguang and Zeng Tianshou, confident that with this Pseudo Epoch Treasure sword, he could escape even if they tried to stop him.

"Boom..." The stars fractured. The golden lightning sword collided with Zhou Zhanguang and Zeng Tianshou's martial arts.

Countless stars exploded, the area around them filled with swirling gray mist. The entire starry sky was stirred up by the violent waves. Even Luo Tian, within the Epoch Bell's protection, felt the devastating power.

"Truly terrifying. A Late Stage master has reached such a level that he can pluck stars with one hand!" Luo Tian's heart was overwhelmed. This was his first true glimpse of a Late Stage master's battle.

"Boom..." Three forces collided within the destruction, making Luo Tian feel his own insignificance.

The thunderous roars lasted for a quarter of an hour. The gray storm gradually dissipated, revealing the three figures in Luo Tian's sight.

Li Cheng'en's aged face bore exhaustion. His white robes had numerous wounds, and the wounds were filled with gray mist that constantly roamed, eroding Li Cheng'en's flesh. His wounds could not heal quickly.

"Go!" Li Cheng'en knew he was no match for the two combined. To have lasted this long was his limit. If he continued, he would definitely perish.

Thinking of this, Li Cheng'en cast the golden sword into the stars. He stood on it and transformed into a streak of light, leaving without hesitation toward the distance.

"Haha! Li Cheng'en, do you think I have only one Pseudo Epoch Treasure?" Zhou Zhanguang laughed as he watched Li Cheng'en flee. He extended his hand, and a purple gourd flew from it.

Zhou Zhanguang's hands formed seals. Green seals flashed, merging into the purple gourd. The gourd's lid lifted, and a terrifying aura immediately rose from it.

"Return!" Zhou Zhanguang extended his hand. The purple gourd suddenly activated, emitting an immense suction force that made Li Cheng'en stop instantly and retreat.

"Crash..." Countless stars followed, the purple gourd emitting seals that filled the entire starry sky. Under Luo Tian's astonishment, those massive stars were forcibly absorbed into the gourd.

Chapter 1039: Crimson Lightning Curse

In the Four Sacred Star Domains, the purple gourd, like a star itself, emitted endless suction. Countless stars were absorbed into it, forming a vacuum within a hundred miles.

"Terrifying! A Pseudo Epoch Treasure in the hands of a Late Stage master is so terrifying!" Luo Tian gazed at the purple gourd absorbing even the stars, his face showing shock. The surrounding area felt gray and oppressive, making it hard to breathe.

Li Cheng'en's face also changed slightly as he was uncontrollably pulled toward the purple gourd.

But in an instant, Li Cheng'en's face turned mad. He knew he couldn't return; if he did, he would definitely die.

"Go!" Li Cheng'en's hands moved slightly. He spat out a mouthful of blood, forming a seal that merged into the sword beneath his feet.

"Zzz..." Golden light spread. Terrifying lightning surged from Li Cheng'en's sword, breaking free from the suction force and flying toward the distance.
