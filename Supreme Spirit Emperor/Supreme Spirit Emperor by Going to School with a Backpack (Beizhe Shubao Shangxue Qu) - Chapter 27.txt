In order to cope with the various dangers within the forest, Luo Tian had been frantically refining elixirs these past few days, replenishing his dwindling stock of medicinal pills.

During this time, several other sects had attempted to recruit the Gu family, but all were rejected by Gu Yun. Those who persisted were swiftly dispatched by Luo Tian—body-turning stage disciples were kicked out of the compound, while bone-subjugation stage masters found themselves confronted by the Wuxing Sect's Elixir Hall's jade token, which sent them retreating in disgrace.

During this period, Wang Tianxiang had arrived twice. After Luo Tian shamelessly pilfered a few more elixirs from him, the latter was expelled in a fit of rage.

Five days passed swiftly. After completing his final batch of elixirs, Luo Tian strolled along the main path of the Gu family's courtyard.

Since the incident with the Shangguan clan, the Gu family had grown even more united. Younger members trained ceaselessly, hoping to one day bring honor to their family.

Luo Tian arrived at the training ground and observed the Gu disciples practicing. A look of quiet satisfaction crossed his face.

Luo Tian's popularity had grown exponentially compared to when he first arrived at the Gu family, and he had become a role model for the disciples. Upon seeing him approach, they all cast respectful glances his way and greeted him warmly.

Luo Tian nodded in acknowledgment, signaling them to continue their training. He remained nearby, watching silently.

Seeing Luo Tian's presence, the Gu disciples redoubled their efforts.

"Hmm-ha-he!" A high-pitched, childish voice echoed among the young disciples.

Luo Tian turned curiously toward the sound and spotted a girl no taller than two feet, sporting twin pigtails. She mimicked the movements of the Gu disciples with earnest concentration, her face occasionally streaked with snot.

Luo Tian approached the crowd and gazed at the girl, his expression softening.

The girl spotted Luo Tian approaching and stared at him with wide, dewy eyes, her face alight with admiration. She forgot to wipe the snot running down her nose.

Luo Tian knelt, wiped the girl's nose, and lifted her into his arms. "What's your name?" he asked gently.

"Gu Yunei!" the girl replied in a high-pitched voice.

"Luo Tian, tell me, are you tired? Do you want to play?" Luo Tian combed through Gu Yunei's disheveled hair.

"I'm tired... I want to play!" The girl, clearly incapable of lying, lowered her head and counted on her fingers as if she had committed a crime.

"Then go play. I'll take care of this," Luo Tian said, ruffling her head. "I promise to save Qianxue sister soon. Then she can take you playing, okay?"

"Really?" The girl's face lit up with hope, her dewy eyes fixed on Luo Tian.

"Trust me, I never lie. Let's make a pact!" Luo Tian extended his little finger.

"Little finger, hook..." The child's稚嫩 voice rang out as she solemnly completed the ritual.

Two small fingers pressed together, sealing their pact.

"Go play," Luo Tian patted her head.

"Okay!" Gu Yunei nodded vigorously and skipped away, her pigtails bouncing.

Luo Tian watched the girl's joyful figure under the setting sun, whispering, "Qianxue, the Gu family... I'll guard it for you. Wait for me!"

...

That night, Luo Tian sat alone on his bed.

He held a jade vial in his hand and muttered, "I've reached the ninth level of body-turning. Body-turning is a process of accumulation. Though my spiritual energy is far stronger than others, my physique isn't yet sufficient!"

He poured the elixins from the vial—medicinal pills he had refined for the Gu family these past days. Known as "Zengyuan Dan" (Enhanced Spiritual Energy Pills), they were third-grade elixirs, simple in purpose but easy to refine for Luo Tian.

He placed the pill in his mouth. Eighty percent of its herbal power erupted, and he activated the Five Elements Transmutation Art to refine it. A stream of medicinal energy coalesced into pure spiritual energy, merging with his existing reserves.

A short while later, Luo Tian opened his eyes.

"Bone-subjugation, bone-subjugation! Transform spiritual energy into bones! I still lack enough accumulation. I've reached the peak of body-turning—whether spiritual energy or physical strength, I must refine it to its absolute limit. I'll be unmatched at the bone-subjugation stage!"

Luo Tian swallowed three more Zengyuan Dan, activating the Five Elements Transmutation Art to refine their power.

Throughout the night, Luo Tian had no idea how many Zengyuan Dan he'd consumed. The eightieth-percent herbal power elixirs were all transformed into spiritual energy, merging into his meridians.

At dawn the next day, Luo Tian opened his eyes and felt a viscous sensation within his body. A few droplets of liquid-like substance had formed in his dantian.

"Though I've increased my spiritual energy significantly, it's still far from complete transformation into liquid. This spiritual energy droplet is far stronger than ordinary spiritual energy. If all my dantian's spiritual energy becomes liquid, I'll gain an edge over others at the bone-subjugation stage!" Luo Tian muttered.

"Let me calculate... The Wuxing Sect's people should arrive today, right?" Luo Tian adjusted his robes and strode toward Gu Yun's courtyard.

After a brief meal, they arrived at the main gate of the Gu family.

As soon as they stepped outside the gates, several figures appeared simultaneously at the city's outskirts.

"The Wuxing Sect disciples have arrived in Tianyuan City. All sects, come forth to welcome them!" A domineering voice echoed across Tianyuan City.

Luo Tian heard the sound and furrowed his brow, extending his spiritual awareness. His expression shifted slightly: "It's him!"

Chapter 127: Reencountering Huang Tianxiao

"Someone you know?" Gu Yun noticed Luo Tian's changed expression and asked softly.

Hearing Gu Yun's question, Luo Tian's face darkened. "Huang Tianxiao!"

"What? Do you have a grudge against him?" Gu Yun's expression turned grim.

"Back when I was in the entrance exam, my senior brother had a conflict with him because I'd killed his disciple. He was his only student!" Luo Tian's voice carried a bitter tone as he gazed at Huang Tianxiao standing proudly outside the city.

"Does that mean he'll target you?" Gu Yun's face darkened as well.

Clearly, if Huang Tianxiao caused trouble for Luo Tian in the Great An Forest, it would greatly hinder their quest to find medicinal herbs and treasures.

"Master Long Zhenhai of the Ferocious Sword Sect has arrived to welcome the Wuxing Sect's elders and disciples!" A domineering voice echoed, as the Ferocious Sword Sect's representatives arrived at Tianyuan City's gates.

"Battlefield Sect... Shadow Stream Sect..." The voices of various sects echoed from the city, as major forces temporarily stationed in Tianyuan City rushed to the gates.

Huang Tianxiao's face bore a triumphant expression. He hadn't expected the sect to send him to search for treasures in the Great An Forest. If he could obtain these treasures, even if they didn't fully belong to him, it would satisfy his vanity.

To many in the northern region, the Wuxing Sect was like a local tyrant. These second-rate sects clearly feared the Wuxing Sect.

Though Huang Tianxiao was only at the early stage of bone-subjugation, he was even weaker than some second-rate sects' elders. Yet even late-stage bone-subjugation elders greeted him politely.

Seeing the crowd's reverent gazes, Huang Tianxiao maintained his haughty demeanor. This caused some of the Wuxing Sect disciples accompanying him to frown.

They disapproved of Huang Tianxiao's bullying behavior. Dong Sansi was one such disciple. He had endured Huang Tianxiao's arrogance throughout the journey, but what truly infuriated him was when a noble disciple failed to show respect and was subsequently crippled and had his cultivation erased.

Dong Sansi could only watch helplessly, unable to speak out. Moreover, his relationship with Luo Tian was well-known within the Wuxing Sect, so Huang Tianxiao had constantly berated and beaten him throughout the journey.

"Dong Sansi!"

Luo Tian also noticed Dong Sansi in the crowd. His face was bruised, clearly injured.

"Dong Sansi! Bring Luo Tian out here. I heard he's in Tianyuan City, but he didn't even greet his elders!" Huang Tianxiao said coldly to Dong Sansi, his face expressionless.

Huang Tianxiao's gaze fell on the cold-faced Dong Sansi, and he recalled Luo Tian and his senior brothers. He vented all his resentment toward them onto Dong Sansi.

"Can't you go find him yourself?" Despite his injuries, Dong Sansi remained calm and replied coldly.

"Who's in charge? Me or you? It seems you haven't had enough of a beating yet!" Huang Tianxiao's face darkened as he glared at Dong Sansi.

"Hmph! You're really not worth it, Dong Sansi. Do you think being close to Luo Tian makes you immune to other sect disciples?" A disciple from the Earth-Soil Sect mocked.

This disciple's words prompted others from the Earth-Soil Sect to quickly agree.

Other sects, like the Greenwood Sect and Golden Light Sect, remained silent. Some cast pitying glances but dared not speak due to Huang Tianxiao's bone-subjugation strength.

The Earth-Soil Sect disciples slowly surrounded Dong Sansi, their movements practiced—this was clearly not the first time.

Other second-rate sects watched the scene with folded arms, eager to witness the Wuxing Sect's internal affairs.

One Earth-Soil Sect disciple waved his hand and struck Dong Sansi fiercely, initiating a beating. Others rushed in with ferocity.

Dong Sansi was no match for them and quickly fell to the ground. A disciple from the Earth-Soil Sect stomped on his chest.

"Kid, shout three times that Luo Tian is a fool, and I'll let you go!" The disciple sneered.

The crowd watched the scene. Some of the second-rate sects, hearing mentions of Luo Tian, guessed these people had a grudge against him. They exchanged thoughtful glances recalling their previous visit to Luo Tian.

"Daydream!" Dong Sansi spat blood, his eyes resolute. He couldn't bring himself to insult the person he revered.

"Disgraceful!" The disciple raised his foot high and stomped down on Dong Sansi's chest.

If this kick landed, Dong Sansi would be severely injured even if he survived.

"Crack!" A crisp sound of a broken bone echoed.

Some people closed their eyes, unwilling to witness the scene.

But instead of seeing Dong Sansi's chest break, they saw the Earth-Soil Sect disciple flying backward, his chest visibly caved in.

"Luo Tian! Luo Tian the Elixir Master!" The crowd saw a figure no stronger than Dong Sansi standing proudly before him.

Dong Sansi's face lit up with relief as he shouted, "Luo Tian!"

"Huang Tianxiao! You really are bringing honor to the Earth-Soil Sect. You dare not trouble my senior brother, yet you dare to bully Elixir Hall disciples?" Luo Tian glared at Huang Tianxiao, his anger boiling.

"The people who attacked Dong Sansi—break your arms! I won't pursue it, but don't make me act. It'll be more than just broken arms!" Luo Tian scolded the Earth-Soil Sect disciples.

"Hmph! What are you, Luo Tian? Daring to tell us to break our arms? With Master Huang here, it's not your place to give orders!" A disciple from the Earth-Soil Sect mocked.

"Dead!" Luo Tian instantly became a blur of motion, appearing before the mocking disciple. His thin body unleashed immense power, striking the disciple's arm and kicking his leg.

Two crisp sounds of broken bones echoed, accompanied by the disciple's screams. Luo Tian returned to his original position—only three seconds had passed.

Wang Tianxiang, standing in the Ferocious Sword Sect's group, watched Luo Tian's ferocity with excitement. He was also grateful for the mercy Luo Tian had shown earlier and felt it was worth it to have this little uncle.

Other second-rate sects' bone-subjugation masters, witnessing Luo Tian's attack, wore expressions of shock. His speed and power were far beyond what a ninth-level body-turning disciple should possess.

Initially, they had focused on Luo Tian's identity as a Wuxing Sect disciple. Now, they couldn't help but notice his strength. His power exceeded ordinary body-turning disciples significantly—perhaps even rivaling some weaker bone-subjugation masters.

They were correct; Luo Tian's physical and spiritual strength far surpassed ordinary ninth-level body-turning disciples, by several times.

"Huang Tianxiao! You're really bold to attack Wuxing Sect disciples in front of me. What kind of example is this? If I don't teach you a lesson today, what will you do tomorrow?" Huang Tianxiao's face was filled with anger. Luo Tian's actions had embarrassed him and tarnished his reputation.

"First, don't try to intimidate me with your so-called elders. You're not worthy of being my elder. Second, the Earth-Soil Sect attacked Elixir Hall first. Third, you're wrong—today I'll even dare to hit you!" Luo Tian's lips curled into a cold smile as he replied.

"Hah! Do you think your status as a Five Elements Body genius makes you capable of defeating bone-subjugation masters? Fine, I'll show you the fury of a bone-subjugation master. You won't be able to withstand it!" Huang Tianxiao laughed bitterly, stepping forward toward Luo Tian.

"Everyone, please help me! Even if I kill this old man, I'll take the blame alone. No one will be harmed. Trust in the Wuxing Sect's Elixir Hall reputation, and consider it a favor I owe you!" Luo Tian saw Huang Tianxiao's confident demeanor and called out to the surrounding crowd.

"Hmph! This is Wuxing Sect business. Who dares interfere?" Huang Tianxiao clearly didn't believe Luo Tian had such influence and shouted.

"Hah! Master Luo, we'll help!" Wang Tianxiang's master, a bone-subjugation mid-stage elder of the Ferocious Sword Sect, spoke up.

"It's an honor to assist Master Luo!" A senior from the Shadow Stream Sect also stepped forward, bowing to Luo Tian.

After these two, many second-rate sects stood up, creating a fiery scene. Nearly ten bone-subjugation masters surrounded Huang Tianxiao.

Huang Tianxiao, who had already been confident of victory, was stunned by the sudden appearance of these bone-subjugation masters. He hadn't expected that those who had previously welcomed him so warmly would now help Luo Tian to attack him. Under the pressure of over ten bone-subjugation masters, his legs trembled involuntarily.

"You! You!" Huang Tianxiao's fear overwhelmed him, his finger trembling as he pointed at the surrounding bone-subjugation masters.

Luo Tian looked down on Huang Tianxiao with disdain: "Old dog, do you really think I'd fight you? My mind isn't kicked by a donkey. Have you forgotten what I'm most famous for in the Wuxing Sect?"

Hearing Luo Tian's mockery, Huang Tianxiao and his Earth-Soil Sect disciples suddenly realized. They recalled Luo Tian's other identity, one more renowned than his Five Elements Body—his status as an Elixir Master!

Indeed, it was Luo Tian's role as an Elixir Master that had prompted these bone-subjugation masters to act. Over the past few days, Luo Tian had continuously refined elixirs, and with Wang Tianxiang's promotion, he had given each visiting bone-subjugation master a pill.

These second-rate sect elders naturally understood some elixirs and, after studying them, realized the uniqueness of Luo Tian's pills. Thus, his status as a fourth-grade Elixir Master spread among these second-rate sects.

Luo Tian was naturally a five-element genius, an Elixir Hall disciple, and a prodigy Elixir Master. If he didn't die early, his future was limitless. These second-rate sect elders wouldn't miss such an opportunity to forge a relationship, especially since it was also an excuse to beat this bone-subjugation master they had long disliked.

"Everyone, I know you've suffered a lot on the way here. Now's your chance to vent! Don't hold back. I'll take responsibility for everything!" Luo Tian turned to the other sect disciples and smiled gently.

Luo Tian had already noticed that these other sect disciples clearly harbored resentment toward Huang Tianxiao and the Earth-Soil Sect. He used this opportunity to draw them into his camp, making Huang Tianxiao a lone wolf.

"Master Luo's words are enough! I'll take this chance, Ma! I've had enough of the insults on the way here. Zhong Yulei, come out! I'll beat you so badly your mother won't recognize you!" A burly man sneered and approached a disciple from the Earth-Soil Sect.

With one person leading, the others exploded like firecrackers, growling and rushing toward the Earth-Soil Sect disciples.

In an instant, the scene became chaotic. The only commonality was that every person wearing Earth-Soil Sect robes lay on the ground, groaning. Even Huang Tianxiao was no exception.

These people had shown mercy; otherwise, Huang Tianxiao would have died in an instant. They knew that if Huang Tianxiao truly died, even if Luo Tian took the blame, the Earth-Soil Sect's anger would extend to their sect. So they only beat and tortured him without killing.

Seizing the moment, Luo Tian approached Dong Sansi and placed a pill in his mouth.

Seeing Dong Sansi's hesitant expression, Luo Tian smiled: "No need to say anything. I've dragged you into this!"

"Umm..." A buzzing sound filled people's ears.

As people joyfully beat the Earth-Soil Sect to vent their emotions, the brilliant light screen of the Great An Forest gradually dimmed.

The bone-subjugation masters stopped their actions, faces glowing with excitement as they whispered, "Treasure is about to open!"

Chapter 129: The Great An Forest's Ferocity

Luo Tian also watched the dimming light screen, his face glowing with excitement. "It's finally opened!"

Gu Yun was still marveling at Luo Tian's growth, realizing he had used his advantages. He also noticed the dimming light screen and wore an excited expression, as it had been over five days. Tian Bo couldn't wait any longer and hurriedly approached Luo Tian.

The second-rate sect bone-subjugation masters stopped their actions, returning to their groups and gathering people. They rushed toward the Great An Forest's direction, not wanting to fall behind others.

Other sect disciples also stopped their actions and gathered around Luo Tian, clearly regarding him as the leader of this expedition.

Luo Tian turned to Gu Yun and said a few words before waving his sleeve: "Let's go!"

Luo Tian's voice had barely finished when the Wuxing Sect disciples vanished from sight, rushing toward the Great An Forest.

As everyone left, only the Earth-Soil Sect disciples, including Huang Tianxiao, remained on the city's outskirts, groaning in pain.

Huang Tianxiao was a bone-subjugation master; the other bone-subjugation masters hadn't killed him, so he recovered within a moment, his body battered.

Seeing Luo Tian's disappearing figure, Huang Tianxiao's face twisted with hatred: "Kid, wait until we get to the Great An Forest. I'll show you!"

Huang Tianxiao sat cross-legged, waiting for the other Earth-Soil Sect disciples to recover.

...

Luo Tian's group moved swiftly, and before long, they reached the Great An Forest's perimeter.

At this moment, the forest's outer area was already filled with a dense crowd of people from various sects. They stood in groups, whispering among themselves.

Luo Tian gazed at the endless Great An Forest, feeling a mix of emotions. He marveled at its mystery—how he had once fallen into the Wàngyōu Pool in the Great An Forest and obtained the Epoch Book. The current commotion was no less than when the Epoch Book had awakened. He wondered what unprecedented treasures were emerging within.

Luo Tian observed the various small sects and frowned, knowing these people had helped him only because of his Elixir Master status. If they encountered real treasures, he would be nothing.

"This expedition into the Great An Forest will be difficult," Luo Tian muttered.

In truth, Luo Tian didn't care about these people but was more concerned with the Great An Forest's mystery and its endless beasts.

The light screen disappeared under people's eyes, revealing the Great An Forest's true form in their eager anticipation.

A thick wave of spiritual energy radiated from the forest's depths, invigorating people.

"Absolutely a treasure!" People exclaimed excitedly.

But beneath their excitement, the spiritual energy gradually disappeared until the Great An Forest returned to silence.

"What's happening? Why is the spiritual energy disappearing?" People shouted, confused by its disappearance.

"Roar..." A dragon's roar echoed.

After the dragon's cry, it seemed to trigger a chain reaction. Various beasts howled, their voices shaking the heavens and echoing into people's ears. A wave of fierce energy gathered like a long rainbow, shooting into the sky and spreading out.

Everyone hearing this deafening roar shivered involuntarily, fearfully gazing at the Great An Forest as if it had opened its bloodthirsty maw.

"Human!" A voice that shook the soul echoed through cold eyes, imprinting itself in people's minds.

Luo Tian also felt this gaze—cold and aloof, looking down on all beings. The people who had come to the Great An Forest were struck as if by lightning, unable to move. Whether bone-subjugation or body-turning stage disciples, they were all crushed by this gaze, too afraid to breathe.

"I have some treasures emerging. Some are useful to me; others are useless to my beast clan. If you wish to search for treasures, it's acceptable. However! If you dare harm my Great An Forest's people—be it a mouse or an insect—you'll regret it forever in this Great An Forest!" The cold and brutal voice echoed in people's hearts.

"Who is this? Is he the master of the Great An Forest?" People were in disbelief. They had never known the Great An Forest had a master. If it was unified, it could become the first force in the northern region—perhaps even the top force on Tianyuan Continent.

Compared to the Wuxing Sect, the Great An Forest was far stronger. With its vast area and countless beasts within, if these beasts were unified and left the Great An Forest, it would be a terrifying event.

Luo Tian's heart was also in turmoil, filled with shock. Others hadn't felt it, but he had—when that gaze swept over him, it carried a hidden meaning.

Luo Tian didn't know what attitude the gaze's owner had toward him. If it was hostile, this Great An Forest expedition would be extremely dangerous. Just that cold gaze had made him feel he couldn't withstand it; killing him would take only a thought.

Such a power, Luo Tian had only seen in the Epoch Book's images before. Thinking of the Epoch Book, his heart trembled again. He had obtained the Epoch Book in the Great An Forest. This person, or beast, called the Great An Forest their territory—was there a connection between this being and the Epoch Book?

As Luo Tian pondered, many second-rate sect elders and disciples began to panic. Some had already decided to retreat, as this gaze's owner was too terrifying.

Others had excitement in their eyes—treasures that could catch this powerful being's attention must be extraordinary. Even if it was what the power had left behind, these people would consider it worth risking their lives.

Some people couldn't resist the temptation of treasures and entered the Great An Forest, while others chose to retreat silently from the outer perimeter.

"Luo Senior Brother, what do we do?" A disciple from the Golden Light Sect asked Luo Tian with a questioning tone.

All Wuxing Sect disciples also turned their eyes to Luo Tian, who was standing there in silence with his brows furrowed. They didn't dare to disturb him further.

Finally, all second-rate sects either retreated or entered the forest, leaving only Luo Tian's group standing there, waiting for his answer.

"Enter!" Luo Tian said with a determined expression.

Chapter 130: Perilous Situation

Hearing Luo Tian's answer, the other Wuxing Sect disciples said nothing. If they didn't agree, it wouldn't be good for anyone.

"Remember, no matter what happens, your life is the priority!" Luo Tian reminded them before distributing some of his elixirs.

The Wuxing Sect disciples felt grateful. A single elixir could save a life in critical moments, and Luo Tian's elixirs were already popular within the Wuxing Sect.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian gave more elixirs to Dong Sansi, patted his shoulder, and led the Wuxing Sect disciples back into the Great An Forest they had been away from for over a year.

...

In the depths of the Great An Forest, a middle-aged man in white robes wore a worried expression. A child slept in his arms.

"Long, is this plan feasible?" A woman's voice echoed, filled with tension.

"This human greed would never fail. I wonder if the person we're looking for is among them. If so, all our efforts weren't in vain. If not, these people won't easily escape my Great An Forest," the man said with a hint of arrogance, his face softening as he gazed at the child.

The sleeping child seemed to be deeply asleep, occasionally sucking on their fingers, soundly asleep.

"Sigh..." The woman sighed and took the child from the man's arms, carrying it under the watchful eyes of surrounding beasts. She and the man walked into a cave.

"I wonder if the leader's plan will succeed..."

A tiger spoke in human language, watching the middle-aged couple enter the cave.

"It should be fine. The leader's years of self-sacrifice to keep this child alive were truly difficult. If it weren't for the previous appearance of spiritual energy rain, the leader would have advanced successfully at that time. Otherwise, even the leader wouldn't have been able to endure it!"

A leopard spoke in human language as well.

"Yes," the echoing voices of agreement followed, a scene so astonishing it would make anyone's jaw drop.

Beasts speaking in human language—this meant they had reached the Tian stage, equivalent to humans' spiritual soul stage. Such a number of Tian-stage beasts was an unimaginable force.

...

Luo Tian and his group cautiously walked through the Great An Forest, even in the outer areas. They were still careful because that power had warned them not to harm a single insect.

Though people didn't believe such a powerful being would care about an insect's life, they chose to be cautious. After all, they knew some powerful people had strange personalities. Who knew if the beasts were like that?

Not only Luo Tian, but other sect members also moved carefully, avoiding disturbing the beasts. But that didn't mean the beasts wouldn't provoke humans.

The situation of the Feiyun Sect was like this—Disciplinary Elder Yu Pengfei led his disciples into a fierce battle with several beasts.

"Xuanwu Qingfengli!" Yu Pengfei's face was bitter as he faced several white beasts. Their appearance made it impossible to tell they were beasts; one might think they were cute animals.

But their ruby-like eyes and exposed fangs revealed the terror of these beasts.

Qingfengli moved like a breeze, impossible for Feiyun Sect disciples to block. Combined with the warning before entering, these disciples were in a tough spot.

Before long, some disciples fell to the ground, their claws carrying anesthetic poison.

Yu Pengfei dodged one Qingfengli's attack and saw that over half of his disciples had fallen, convulsing on the ground.

Yu Pengfei's face darkened as he unleashed his bone-subjugation stage power, transforming into lightning and rushing toward a Qingfengli that seemed to be the leader.

This Qingfengli was at the early stage of bone-subjugation, no match for Yu Pengfei's fury.

"Smack!" Yu Pengfei's palm struck the Qingfengli's white fur.

"Roar..." A piercing scream echoed through the entire Great An Forest, causing people's ears to ache.

This situation wasn't unique to Feiyun Sect; other sects who had bad luck also encountered various beasts. Some escaped from the beasts, others were forced to fight back out of desperation. Most became food for the beasts.

Luo Tian kept hearing voices from beasts or humans, his brows furrowed because they hadn't seen a single beast yet. This surprised Luo Tian and Dong Sansi.

"Human! Are you ignoring my words?" A cold voice echoed after the beasts were injured.

At this cold voice, every bone-subjugation master who had attacked the beasts spat blood.

"Spit..." Yu Pengfei was among them, wiping his mouth and wearing a look of reverence.

"Terrifying! I felt like I was about to die!" Yu Pengfei's heart remained unsettled.

Other sects' bone-subjugation masters also wore looks of reverence, clearly unable to attack the beasts anymore.

"Within ten seconds, bone-subjugation masters, leave the Great An Forest! After ten seconds, all bone-subjugation masters in the Great An Forest will die!" The cold voice echoed again.

"Ten..." Before people could react, the cold voice echoed in their ears.

All bone-subjugation masters' faces changed dramatically. Ten seconds was neither long nor short, but for these injured bone-subjugation masters, it was insufficient.

They vanished instantly, fleeing like scared mice from the Great An Forest.

Ten seconds later, most bone-subjugation masters were panting heavily, gazing at the Great An Forest.

Yet some bone-subjugation masters with weaker cultivation hadn't escaped within ten seconds.

"One..." A voice like death echoed.

"Spit..." These people, in that moment, wore expressions of pain and fear, their faces filled with despair. They turned into blood mist and shattered under people's terrified gazes.

Chapter 131: Re-entering the Illusion

"Ah..." A gasp of cold air escaped from the elders who had fled.

Luo Tian's spiritual awareness had been scanning the fleeing bone-subjugation masters' deaths, his heart heavy with concern.
