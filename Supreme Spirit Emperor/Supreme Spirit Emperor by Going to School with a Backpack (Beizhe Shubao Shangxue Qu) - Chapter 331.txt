“Alright, everyone return!” Tong Yangjian let out a long sigh, his lips curling into a bitter smile before his figure flickered and he soared toward the First Island. Clearly, he was preparing to leave Seven Star Island. As for Luo Tian and Guan Xingjian’s duel, Tong Yangjian regarded it as trivial. Whether one prevailed over the other was irrelevant compared to returning to the Nine Realms.

The other island masters also departed one by one, their excitement palpable at the thought of returning to the Nine Realms.

At that moment, three members of the Ancient Royal Clans appeared at the edge of Seven Star Sea alongside Qizi Ang and Hun Tiance, their faces etched with solemnity.

“Seven Star Island! They still managed to escape!” A middle-aged man from the Blood Clan sneered, his gaze fixed on Seven Star Sea without advancing further.

“We must report this to our clan. The蛮族 (Barbarian Clan) rescued that boy—this cannot be ignored!” Hun Tiance’s strength spoke, his voice cold.

“Collaborating with the human race is a fate that would doom the Barbarian Clan!” The three coldly declared before vanishing in a blur toward the Wilderness City.

……

At the Third Island, Luo Tian and Shen Gongfu stood in his former courtyard.

“Island Master, when did you return?” Luo Tian sighed softly, raising a hand. The dust-laden courtyard instantly restored to its former state.

“A year ago!” Shen Gongfu’s face bore a bitter expression as he asked, “Have you heard anything about Feichi?”

“No,” Luo Tian shook his head. He thought of Shen Feichi’s rotund figure, a sigh escaping him.

He had only stayed in the Wilds for a short time. During those days, he had found nothing, and after leaving with Fu Xingyue, there was even less news.

“Where has he gone? The soul lamp still hasn’t dimmed,” Shen Gongfu murmured, a wry smile on his lips.

“Fate will guide him. Once my wounds heal, I’ll go to the Wilds again,” Luo Tian admitted, his concern evident.

“Enough. For a year now, I’ve scoured the Wilds without success. He must not have fallen into the Barbarian Clan’s grasp.”

“Then where could he be? According to logic, a human alone in the Barbarian Continent should struggle at every step,” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, exchanging a glance with Shen Gongfu.

“Sea’s Corner!” They both spoke in unison, their eyes flashing with determination.

“It must be right. The only place on the Barbarian Continent that remains undetected is Sea’s Corner. He must still be there,” Shen Gongfu murmured.

“Only a few years remain until Sea’s Corner opens again. The Seven Star Island people won’t wait for Feichi alone,” Shen Gongfu sighed softly.

“Let it go. I feel he’ll return on his own,” Luo Tian comforted, gazing at Shen Gongfu.

“Hmph. Rest well. Three days from now, after your duel with Guan Xingjian, the Void Spacecraft will likely commence,” Shen Gongfu rose to depart, preparing for the Third Island’s evacuation from Seven Star.

“Kid, I hope you return,” Luo Tian sighed softly before entering meditation to recover.

Time flowed steadily. Seven Star Island brimmed with preparation, orders cascading from each island master.

Though the people of Seven Star Island didn’t know why, they obeyed without question. An instinctual sense told them that with Luo Tian’s return, Seven Star Island might undergo change.

As time passed, people learned the island might fully evacuate. The destination? None other than the Nine Realms—long cherished by all Seven Star Island inhabitants since antiquity.

Though the news was uncertain, it ignited excitement. Evacuating Seven Star Island and escaping the Barbarian Clan’s threat was a blessing beyond measure.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian’s duel with Guan Xingjian became the talk of the island. Speculation ran rampant over who would prevail.

……

In the Barbarian Clan’s Divine Spirit Palace, Saman glared at three middle-aged men seated before him. Behind them stood two pale youths.

“Saman, the Barbarian Clan attacked us. Please explain. Moreover, after we pursued him, that Barbarian fled to your continent’s Seven Star Island. Clearly, there is a close connection between the mid-period era Barbarian Clan and humans!” The three men bowed, their voices sharp.

“That was a traitor of our Barbarian Clan. Someone took him while I was absent from the Divine Spirit Palace,” Saman replied softly, his gaze deep.

“Seven Star Island? It’s no match for the Barbarian Army!” Saman’s words had barely finished when three aged figures strode in—those previously halted by Fu Tianqing.

“Did you kill that boy Fu Wenbin protected?” Saman asked, sensing the curse power within Luo Tian.

“Indeed. But an unexpected mishap occurred. Please have your clan eliminate this boy, or let the Seven Star Island on our continent vanish!” The three Royal Clan elders spoke coldly.

“This is our Barbarian matter. You have no right to interfere!” Saman, a figure of authority, rebuked them.

“Then let our three clans send forces to eradicate Seven Star Island!” The three mid-period Royal Clan elders bowed respectfully, their faces devoid of fear.

“This is our Barbarian land, not your Royal Clan’s domain!” The gathered Barbarians glared at the three clans.

“Hmph. If that’s so, we won’t object. But hope you don’t regret it,” Saman chuckled, his gaze piercing.

“Then we’ll take our leave. Our Royal Clan forces will arrive. Hope the Barbarians don’t hinder us,” the three bowed.

“Hmph. Don’t enter the Wilds. If anyone does, they’ll be slain without mercy,” Saman spoke softly, his tone sharp.

“Yet for the Barbarian Clan’s peace, we ask you to stay in my Divine Spirit Palace for a few days,” Saman added before the three could speak further. He extended his hand, and with a flick, he ensnared the three mid-period elders, their bodies engulfed by gray runes.

A hum resonated. Their cultivation plummeted instantly as the runes entered their bodies.

“You others may leave,” Saman addressed the three mid-period elders and Qizi Ang, Hun Tiance. “If one of them dies, so shall the others.”

Saman’s eyes gleamed with cold calculation. None could fathom his thoughts.

……

Three days passed in silence. At dawn, a blinding light erupted from the First Island, its power overwhelming. Guan Xingjian stood atop Seven Star Terrace.

His white robes billowed like snow, a green sword at his back radiating icy brilliance. His eyes bore an unyielding glint as he stood atop the terrace.

“Senior Guan!”
“It’s today! The duel between Senior Guan and Deputy Island Master Luo!” The Seven Star Islanders, preoccupied, suddenly realized the occasion. They abandoned their tasks, rushing toward Seven Star Terrace.

Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, his face still pale from prior injuries.

“Hmph… about time,” Luo Tian sighed, though wounded, he still believed in his victory over Guan Xingjian.

He rose, adjusting his robes with a smile. His figure vanished from the room and appeared at Seven Star Terrace, gazing at Guan Xingjian with a hint of apology.

“Senior Guan, why this hardship? I was wrong before, but your speed in kneeling was too fast—I couldn’t stop you. Also, I didn’t know you were already on the Barbarian Continent. All this was a misunderstanding!” Luo Tian spoke softly, attempting one last defense; if Guan Xingjian lost, it would deeply wound him.

“Enough talk!” Guan Xingjian’s face reddened as if Luo Tian had exposed his wound. He raised his sword, its green blade gleaming.

Chapter 1348: Duel with Guan Xingjian

At Seven Star Terrace, two figures in white robes stood opposite each other. Luo Tian smiled, while Guan Xingjian’s eyes burned with fire, his green sword clutched tightly.

“Back then, I lost to Luo Tian here!” Hu Tianzong stood at the terrace’s base, gazing at Luo Tian with nostalgia. A few years had passed since then; Hu Tianzong’s strength had greatly improved.

“Let’s test each other someday!” Yang Jinghua’s cold voice echoed behind Hu Tianzong, making him smirk.

“Test? You dare?” Hu Tianzong sneered.

“You call that a look? You’re such a fast gunner!” Yang Jinghua retorted, his eyes mocking.

“Hmph…” The surrounding disciples exchanged glances, stifling laughter as their faces turned red.

“You bastard! If you keep calling me a fast gunner, I’ll fight you!” Hu Tianzong’s face darkened, shouting at Yang Jinghua.

“Come on! I’m not afraid!” Yang Jinghua brandished his sword, challenging him.

Hu Tianzong’s face flushed with anger. Once, Yang Jinghua had challenged him during his early era, and they fought for a day and night without result. Later, Yang Jinghua repeatedly challenged him, but Hu Tianzong refused to fight a madman. Yet Yang Jinghua persisted, earning Hu Tianzong the nickname “Fast Gunner,” spreading across Seven Star Island.

“Fast gunner” was a term men understood, often irritating Hu Tianzong. Yet neither could overcome the other.

“Damn it! If you keep calling me that, I’ll kill you!” Hu Tianzong thought of his sisters’ disdainful glances and felt like murdering Yang Jinghua.

“Come on! I welcome your fight! Your gun is fast!” Yang Jinghua taunted, brandishing his sword.

“Zhu…” As they spoke, seven figures appeared in the sky—Seven Star Island’s seven island masters.

“Better to fight. I want to see if Luo Tian has improved in two years!” Shen Gongfu smiled, noting the islanders’ progress. He had reached the early era, but two days ago sensed a threat from Luo Tian’s injuries.

“Guan Xingjian has mastered the Heaven Sword Mountain’s inheritance. No one in millennia achieved it. Though Luo Tian is strong, I don’t believe Guan Xingjian will lose!” The island masters observed Luo Tian and Guan Xingjian with interest. Their strength had surpassed even the island masters.

Meanwhile, five elders sat in meditation on a remote island, their gazes piercing through space toward Seven Star Terrace.

One was a giant over ten zhang tall—Shi Tianming of the Southern Ridge Stone寨. Another was Yun Wuya.

The other three were familiar to Luo Tian: the elder Bai Ze who once treated Guan Xingjian, and a dragon whale that had taken human form.

The first among them wore blue robes, his aura cold and formidable. This was the ice beast beneath the First Island who had tested Luo Tian, now in human form.

“Those boys are growing fast!” Bai Ze smiled, admiration in his eyes.

“Fast, really fast. When I was their age, I was only at the late sage stage. These kids have reached the early era—this era may see them achieve enlightenment!” Yun Wuya smiled.

“Only Xuanbing can reach that step,” the dragon whale mused, gazing at the cold elder.

“Not quite. I sense this era doesn’t belong to us!” Xuanbing shook his head, the highest among them at late era, nearly reaching peak era.

“Is that step so hard?” The four fell silent, gazing at Xuanbing.

“Hard. I feel my strength can only reach peak era. As for that step, it seems beyond cultivation! It’s as if we’ve missed something!” Xuanbing sighed.

“Fine. If I reach peak era, I’ll be content. The future belongs to these kids!” Yun Wuya was philosophical, a smile on his face.

“Hmph. I may not reach that step, but if I witness a new era’s master, my life won’t be wasted!” Bai Ze sighed.

“Right now, returning to the Nine Realms is more urgent. I’ve had a strange feeling these days,” Xuanbing’s gaze deepened, his white eyebrows twitching.

Upon mentioning the Nine Realms, the old men’s faces lit up. As exiles returning home, they were thrilled—only Seven Star Island remained of the human race in the origin realm. How could they not be excited?

“Hmph. We’re nearly ready. The beasts of Seven Star Sea should be here soon. Then we’ll move the island and sea into the Void Spacecraft together,” Bai Ze spoke softly.

“Hmph. Let’s hurry!” Xuanbing nodded, a smile on his face: “The two boys have started!”

“Who do you think will win?” The old elders, rare in their enthusiasm, debated.

“Luo Tian probably. That kid is really strong. I heard of his reputation while imprisoned. No mid-era Royal Clan prodigy could match him!” Shi Tianming mused.

“Indeed. When we saved him, he was ambushed by three mid-era Royal Clan and two prodigies. Those two were beaten to blood and rebirth! I feel even I’d struggle against him now!” Yun Wuya smiled.

“But maybe not. Luo Tian is injured, and we know Guan Xingjian’s strength well!” They discussed as Guan Xingjian charged at Luo Tian.

A storm of swords surrounded Guan Xingjian, his aura overwhelming. The hum resonated as golden sword energy shot toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian stood still, observing Guan Xingjian’s surrounding swords. He nodded in admiration, thinking Guan Xingjian was truly formidable—among the Royal Clan prodigies he’d faced, he ranked top five.

“Hmph… tricky,” Luo Tian inhaled softly. His injuries had healed mostly, but the two gray flames on his soul still burned relentlessly.

Faced with Guan Xingjian’s overwhelming sword, Luo Tian smiled and didn’t dodge. He grabbed the green energy with his hand.

“Burst…” The green sword left a white mark on Luo Tian’s palm but didn’t harm him. With slight pressure, it shattered in his hand.

“Senior Guan, why fight? We’re both human. Why self-attack?” Luo Tian spoke quickly, gazing at Guan Xingjian.

Seeing Luo Tian effortlessly block his attack, Guan Xingjian’s face shifted slightly. Though he hadn’t used full strength, his attack could’ve been blocked—but not so effortlessly by Luo Tian’s bare hands.

“Damn it, he’s stronger again!” Hu Tianzong muttered, scowling.

“Indeed. He’s even stronger now. I wonder how much more?” Yang Jinghua mused, his eyes glowing.

“Still trying to surpass him?” Hu Tianzong asked, seeing Yang Jinghua’s determination.

“Of course. You need a small goal first!” Yang Jinghua smiled, his gaze burning at Luo Tian.

“I advise you not to. We’re geniuses, but Luo Tian is a monster!” Hu Tianzong scoffed, his heart uneasy.

“You’re wrong. You’re afraid before the battle. How can you achieve enlightenment?” Yang Jinghua countered.

“You think too much. With a monster like him, how can you achieve enlightenment?” Hu Tianzong sneered at Yang Jinghua.

As they spoke, Guan Xingjian charged again, his sword slicing relentlessly. Each wave of swords carried immense power, leaving the onlookers stunned.

Yet Luo Tian smiled, his hands striking each sword, shattering them into storms around him. The shattered swords left marks on Seven Star Terrace before vanishing.

“Senior Guan, let’s talk calmly. Why fight?” Luo Tian continued striking swords while urging Guan Xingjian to stop.

“Unbelievable! I’ve never seen anyone block Senior Guan’s sword energy so easily!” The crowd murmured, amazed. Even more shocking was Luo Tian speaking while doing it.

Chapter 1349: The Sword Realm

“Ah…” Luo Tian’s words only angered Guan Xingjian further, perceiving them as mockery. The more furious he became, the more chaotic his sword techniques grew, their power unstable—making it easier for Luo Tian to block.

“I was only trying to help! Senior Guan, we’re both human. Why this?” Luo Tian kept speaking, his hands blocking the swords.

“Shut up!” Guan Xingjian roared, breathing heavily as he retreated. He sensed his loss of control and needed to regroup.

“This is the first time I’ve seen Senior Guan like this! Is this our calm Senior Guan?” The crowd murmured, their eyes filled with surprise.

“Then let’s go to my place and have a drink!” Luo Tian, seeing Guan Xingjian’s heavy breathing, urged again.

“Damn it!” Guan Xingjian heard Luo Tian mention the previous incident—when he had knelt to him. He wanted to strike Luo Tian’s face.

“Sword Realm!” Guan Xingjian, though angry, knew Luo Tian was formidable. His face turned solemn as he took a deep breath, his eyes calm. He tossed his sword into the air.

“Senior Guan has truly awakened! The real Guan Xingjian is the most terrifying!” Hu Tianzong and Yang Jinghua nodded, their faces serious as they watched Guan Xingjian calm down, his hands forming seals.

“Now I’ll treat you as a true opponent. Hope you don’t disappoint me!” Guan Xingjian’s aura calmed, his eyes calm as he sent a green mark into his sword.

“Excellent!” Luo Tian admired Guan Xingjian’s quick recovery, acknowledging him as Seven Star Island’s top prodigy.

As Luo Tian mused, Guan Xingjian’s sword erupted. The green blade split into two, then four, multiplying rapidly to surround Luo Tian and Guan Xingjian.

The clashing of swords began. The green blades didn’t attack Luo Tian but were planted into the ground, their bodies trembling. A vast barrier instantly enveloped both.

Like an ancient array, Luo Tian felt immediate danger, his brows furrowing in seriousness.

“Welcome to the Sword Realm!” Guan Xingjian smiled, gazing at Luo Tian as he raised his hands.

The hum of swords echoed. Next moment, countless sword energies shot from Guan Xingjian’s hands, filling the barrier with terrifying energy.

“Kill!” Guan Xingjian pointed his finger at Luo Tian, as if commanding the sword realm.

“Ugh…” The mournful sounds of swords echoed. Countless swords, seemingly conscious, formed a storm to engulf Luo Tian.

“Tough! The sword energies in this realm are countless, yet all obey Guan Xingjian. How to break through?” Hu Tianzong and Yang Jinghua furrowed their brows, pondering how they’d break through if they were Luo Tian.

“Tricky,” Luo Tian muttered, watching the countless swords approaching. He bit his lips.

Quantity leads to quality. One sword might not harm Luo Tian, but countless would surely threaten him. He stood still, knowing there was no escape in this sword realm.

“Dao Sealing Demon!” Luo Tian didn’t take the swords seriously. He had once blocked them with his bare hands; he could do it again.

“One punch… two punches… ten punches…” Luo Tian’s fists flew, colliding with the terrifying sword energies.

The hum of collision echoed. A storm of swords enveloped Luo Tian, obscuring the view.

“Not enough?” Guan Xingjian frowned. In this sword realm, he was the master.

At that moment, he felt the swords’ power weakening and their numbers decreasing.

“I’ll see what you’ve got!” Guan Xingjian’s face lit with excitement, forgetting his hatred for Luo Tian. He was engrossed in the battle—this was his first encounter with such a formidable opponent.

“Sacrifice Body, Sword!” Guan Xingjian leapt into the air, his era power radiating. He became a sharp blade, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Peng… Peng… Peng…” The thunderous sound echoed. As Guan Xingjian moved, Luo Tian shattered the sword storm and caught his breath—only to see Guan Xingjian approaching.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, gazing at Guan Xingjian transformed into a blade. His expression turned serious.

“Dao Sealing Demon, Fana Killing! One force breaks all!” Luo Tian chanted, his white fists glowing with sanctity. He didn’t retreat but charged toward Guan Xingjian’s blade.

“Star Array Body vs. Reincarnation Body—both are powerful. Guan Xingjian’s method of turning himself into a blade clearly maximized his strength!” Hu Tianzong mused, eyes fixed on the approaching pair.

“Indeed. We knew Guan Xingjian’s sword was strong, but we forgot he is one of the Nine Bodies. Though Luo Tian’s Reincarnation Body ranks first, it’s due to its mystery. If they truly compared flesh and bone, the Nine Bodies would be evenly matched!” Yang Jinghua’s eyes glowed with excitement.

“Senior Guan, fight hard!” The disciples below cheered, shouting loudly.

“The Deputy Island Master is the strongest!” The people of the Third Island also shouted.

“Too strong! Their strength has surpassed mine!” Tong Yangjian sighed, watching the two clash.

“We might only have Shen Gongfu among us who can fight these two young men,” the Second Island’s master Feng Yong smiled bitterly, his gaze on Shen Gongfu.

“Indeed. Fat Man, your strength has improved significantly since entering the early era!” Others gazed at Shen Gongfu.

“I could kill one if I fought with all my might. In a normal fight, I’m no match for them,” Shen Gongfu shook his head.

“You’re not even a match!” The other island masters’ faces changed.

Shen Gongfu, appearing like a shrewd merchant, seemed unimpressive. Yet people knew his terror.

Seven Star Island was surrounded by the Barbarians, who often attacked it. In one large battle, Shen Gongfu’s elder brother was killed by the Barbarians, inciting Shen Gongfu to a frenzy. With half-era strength, he killed over ten thousand Barbarians, including two early-era masters.

This feat shocked everyone. Killing era-level beings with half-era strength was absurdly powerful.

However, people didn’t know Shen Gongfu had a lifelong aftereffect from that frenzy—his strength was hard to improve.

Now even Shen Gongfu admitted this, making the island masters’ gazes toward Luo Tian and Guan Xingjian change.

“Treasures! These two are treasures of Seven Star Island. If they grow, we won’t fear the Ancient Royal Clans! No, the Ancient Alliances!” Their eyes glowed with excitement.

“Crack…” As they marveled, Luo Tian and Guan Xingjian finally collided.

The thunderous sound of collision rose. The Seven Star Terrace trembled, as if two meteors collided.

Next moment, the crowd’s eyes widened. Their mouths gaped in disbelief.

“Step by step…” Luo Tian’s body retreated, each step heavy. Clear footprints marked the terrace.

This wasn’t what stunned them; it was Guan Xingjian’s situation. He was thrown back, his massive sword-shaped aura shattered by Luo Tian’s full-force punch. Guan Xingjian spat blood, colliding with the barrier, his face pale.

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian’s face was also pale. His body had cracks, blood trickling from his lips.

“Luo Tian won!” The crowd murmured, gazing at Luo Tian, pale-faced.

“But Luo Tian’s injuries aren’t much lighter than Guan Xingjian’s!” Hu Tianzong mused, his voice filled with admiration.

“It’s not what you think,” Yang Jinghua looked at Luo Tian with respect.

“Look at his wounds. They’re not fresh. Clearly, they weren’t from this clash!” Yang Jinghua, a veteran of battlefields, was sensitive to wounds.

“You mean his injuries haven’t fully healed? He’s not at peak!” Hu Tianzong gasped.

Chapter 1350: The Nine Swords of Xuantian

“Indeed. When Luo Tian returned, I sensed his injuries were severe—nearly cost him his life! Such serious wounds couldn’t heal in three days. Plus, I sensed curse energy on him!” Yang Jinghua spoke with growing admiration.

The crowd murmured. Yang Jinghua’s words stunned the onlookers. Even injured, Luo Tian had dominated Guan Xingjian.

“Is Deputy Island Master that strong?” The Third Island disciples gazed at Luo Tian, pale-faced.

“Curse. That kid definitely has curse power!” Stone Tianming’s wounds were filled with gray mist, his face showing admiration.

“Moreover, if not for us two, that kid would’ve died! His injuries definitely haven’t healed!” Yun Wuya smiled.

Hearing this, the old elders’ faces changed. They shook their heads: “Guan Xingjian’s luck is bad. Even if he won, it wouldn’t matter. Now it seems even injured Luo Tian dominates him.”

“I feel there’s no need to continue,” Bai Ze sighed. As one who had watched Guan Xingjian grow, he hoped for his victory but couldn’t deny Luo Tian’s monster strength. Even he found it hard to win.

“His injuries aren’t healed?” Guan Xingjian’s face darkened, his gaze on Luo Tian turning complex.

“Continue,” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Guan Xingjian.

“You’re truly strong. But I won’t give up now. This is my strongest technique. If you can withstand it, I’ll accept defeat. Our feud will end!” Guan Xingjian grabbed a golden era sword, its aura fierce.

“Fine. I’ll give it my all!” Luo Tian’s face hardened. His two Reincarnation Immortal Bodies activated, turning into black demons. Black qi swirled around him as he brandished a black demon sword, his aura fierce.

“Be careful. This is the sword technique I mastered on Heaven Sword Mountain—my strongest killing move!” Guan Xingjian spoke softly, his aura gathering.

“Heaven Sword Mountain’s inheritance!” The crowd cheered, their eyes filled with anticipation. Even the old elders showed eagerness.

The Heaven Sword Mountain’s inheritance, like the Third Island’s, had eluded many. Luo Tian had mastered the third stage; now Guan Xingjian had achieved it too—proof of their extraordinary talent.

“Xuantian Nine Swords!” Guan Xingjian’s face turned solemn. His era sword rose, slicing toward Luo Tian. The first sword struck instantly.

Sword energy soared, its power overwhelming. In the Sword Realm, Guan Xingjian reached his peak. A massive sword light descended upon Luo Tian’s head.

“You have the Xuantian Nine Swords, I have the Seven Demon Blades of Reversal!” Luo Tian smiled, his hand sweeping. A blade energy pierced the sky like a demon moon, clashing with the sword.

“Peng…” The collision echoed endlessly. The Sword Realm trembled as their clash destabilized it.

Before the sound faded, Guan Xingjian’s second sword struck. It was even more terrifying than the first, its blade humming as it flew toward Luo Tian.

“Third sword… fourth…” Guan Xingjian’s hand moved, each motion releasing a sky-shattering sword energy. The crowd was stunned.

Each sword, amplified by the Sword Realm, seemed to split the heavens. Each strike surpassed the last. Hu Tianzong and Yang Jinghua’s faces showed shock.

“I can’t withstand it!” They shook their heads, their expressions bitter.

“Truly strong!” Luo Tian’s hands slashed repeatedly. His black blade energy matched the swords, clashing above their heads.

The crowd watched in awe as two titans clashed.
