“An ordinary Ten-Thousand Commander possesses such terrifying power, capable of rivaling a sect's master!” Luotian and others gasped in astonishment, watching the figures vanish into the distance, their minds overwhelmed with awe.

“A Ten-Thousand Commander! I must become one! If I attain this rank here, even a Thousand Commander, upon returning to the sect, I will surely gain recognition—perhaps even vie for the sect master’s position!” countless geniuses cried within their hearts.

“Go!” other Ten-Thousand Commanders also spoke in unison, over a hundred thousand people vanishing into the courtyard.

The Ten-Thousand Commanders departed, followed by those who had not pledged allegiance to them—Thousand Commanders and their forces disappeared into the courtyard.

Luotian stood motionless, seemingly stunned, but his heart was icy cold, for the final glance from Xue Mian.

That gaze brimmed with intense killing intent, etched permanently into Luotian’s mind, sending shivers down his spine.

“Did I kill your family? Do I know you? Why do you wish to kill me so desperately?”

“Damn it, he’s just a Ten-Thousand Commander. I’ll definitely kill him someday!” Luotian raged internally, never expecting such misfortune to befall him.

“Tian Ge, Tian Ge, we should go!” Yeye Chen tugged at Luotian’s sleeve, snapping him out of his trance.

“Tian Ge, don’t fear. I’ll contact our Ye family; Xue Mian won’t dare harm you!” Yeye Chen spoke to Luotian.

“Hmph, we go!” Luotian nodded, though it stung to have Yeye Chen beg for help. Yet, he was no match for the Ten-Thousand Commander at present.

“Yes…” Huozhen and Zhang Desheng’s faces darkened, surprised Luotian had offended a Ten-Thousand Commander. For them, it was no good news.

Yet people said nothing more; they assumed Luotian’s clash with Xue Mian was purely personal, unlikely to involve them.

Luotian pondered his next move, Xue Mian’s presence like a blade at his neck—unpredictable when it might fall. He must prepare beforehand.

“Brilliant, so brilliant that it caught Ke Duanshan’s attention! Another goal is to enhance my strength, overpowering Xue Mian. To dominate a True Immortal Peak, I cannot yet achieve it—but to gain Ke Duanshan’s notice, I still can. This shift is my opportunity!” Luotian murmured to himself.

Soon, Luotian and his group arrived at the battle zone—a vast square where the end was Baitian City, its towering gates guarded by the Eighth Army to prevent ghosts from invading.

“Ugh…” As nearly a hundred thousand entered, mournful cries echoed beyond Baitian City.

A cold aura made people shiver; a powerful pressure swept over them, as dark clouds obscured the sky, rushing toward Baitian City.

“They’ve come!” All held their breath, eyes fixed on the dark clouds, the entire battle zone suffocating with tension.

“Not many—only a few True Immortal Initiates leading, about a hundred thousand ghosts!” Ke Duanshan stood atop the wall, gazing at the approaching dark clouds, murmuring.

“All Ten-Thousand Commanders and below, exit the city to repel the ghosts! This is our Eighth Army’s first battle in seven months—boost our morale!” Ke Duanshan bellowed, eyes on those gathered.

“Yes!” Luotian and all others trembled, then shouted in unison.

“Creak…” Hundreds of feet high, the city gates slowly opened, a cold breeze rushing into Baitian City.

“Roar…” At the gates’ opening, dark vapors surged from the ground, forming grotesque flesh-eating ghosts charging toward Baitian City.

“Buzz…” Though the gates opened, Baitian City’s barrier remained; countless flesh-eaters collided with it, emitting mournful cries as they were purified into black smoke.

With each ghost’s death, battle merits on their wrists grew steadily—merits from the barrier killing ghosts were awarded to defenders.

“Kill!” Meanwhile, Ten-Thousand Commanders surged forward with battle fervor, leading their troops out of Baitian City.

“Kill!” Yechen and Qiuqiandi also roared, having adapted to war during their three months within Baitian City. They faced battle without fear; at the gates’ opening, they rushed out immediately.

Not only the Eighth Army, but other armies sought more merits, joining the Eighth’s forces as they surged forward.

Tens of thousands charged toward the dark clouds like a flood.

“Protect me, please!” Yeye Chen clung tightly to Luotian’s back, the battlefield’s cold aura making him tremble.

“Should I reveal my abilities?” Luotian pondered, deciding how much to expose to draw Ke Duanshan’s attention.

“First observe this battle,” Luotian mused, choosing not to fully unleash yet. He knew his strength could kill many ghosts but wouldn’t impress Ke Duanshan greatly.

As they reached the dark clouds, towering ghostly figures emerged before them.

“Flesh-Eating Ghosts… Speedy Ghosts…” Luotian named the ghosts before him.

“Empty posturing!” Luotian crushed a Flesh-Eater with his foot, then grabbed and burst a Speedy Ghost—two merits added to his wrist.

Most ghosts were True Immortal Level, appearing tall and grotesque but offering no challenge to Luotian.

“Hah! Nothing special!” Yeye Chen laughed, punching a十几-foot-high ghost into oblivion, relaxing.

“Those thirty True Immortal Initiates are the leaders of this attack; they’ve gained sentience!” Luotian’s eyes flashed with light, spotting thirty figures hovering above the endless ghosts.

Chapter 2024: The Immortal King’s Strike ()

“Damn it!” Upon hearing Yefu’s words, Yechen’s face darkened instantly. He leapt into the air toward Baitian City’s exterior.

“Captain!” Before Yechen could flee, Qiuqiandi and Yefu blocked him, shouting.

“You’ll die if you go out! They’re surrounded by ghosts!” Qiuqiandi spoke softly.

“Yes, Captain, you are our leader. If something happens to you, we’ll have no guidance. You care about Yeye Chen’s life—do you not value ours?” Yefu shouted.

“Moreover, if Yeye Chen dies, it’s by ghosts’ hands; the Lord won’t blame us!”

“Dare to say this, but he’s a spoiled brat. If not for his father being the Lord, he’d have died countless times!”

“In our hearts, you, Chen Ge, are the one most worthy to be the future Lord. You surpass Yeye Chen a thousandfold! If Yeye Chen dies, given how much the Lord cherishes you, he may pass the Lordship to you!”

“Lo! I saw him—Luotian was also surrounded by ghosts. If he dies, only you remain among the three Immortal Disciples!” Yefu spoke endlessly, shifting Yechen’s gaze.

“Don’t go—going is death!” Qiuqiandi shook his head gently; nearly a million True Immortal Endings’ ghosts remained, with many True Immortal Initiates. Even a True Immortal Mid-Stage would bleed to death.

“Comrades, follow me to rescue the Ten-Thousand Commander!” Huozhen roared, his voice resolute as he stepped forward and exited Baitian City.

“Yes!” Zhang Desheng shouted, following Huozhen closely. Though some troops hesitated, nearly a hundred followed Zhang Desheng toward the ghost army.

“Crash…” Flames erupted, forming a barrier that shielded Luotian and Yeye Chen. They stood within the flames, gazing at the overwhelming ghosts.

“Tian Ge, are we doomed?” Yeye Chen’s face paled, watching a ghost eyeing them hungrily yet wary of the flames.

“Nothing to fear!” Luotian’s gaze deepened, his hand grasping Yeye Chen’s. A single white hair appeared in Luotian’s palm, nearly imperceptible without close inspection.

“Xue Mian!” Luotian’s eyes turned icy, his teeth clenched as he stared at Xue Mian above, wielding a white ice sword.

White hair tied in an enigmatic knot radiated waves; if not for Luotian’s mastery of the Soul-Controlling Seal and familiarity with ghost-attracting fluctuations, he’d have missed it.

“This grudge, I Luotian remember!” Luotian raged internally; without his abilities, he and Yeye Chen would already be dead.

Yeye Chen’s death because of him was unbearable to Luotian!

“Another fire,师兄. Is this too harsh?” Thunder surrounded the masked figure as he fought a True Immortal Mid-Stage ghost, his eyes ever watchful on Luotian.

Seeing the grotesque ghosts surround Luotian and Yeye Chen, the youth even wanted to intervene but restrained himself.

“Roar…” Upon Luotian removing the white hair, surrounding ghosts surged forward without hesitation, rushing toward him and Yeye Chen.

“Sizzle…” Black vapors rose as ghosts touched the seven-color flames, instantly turning to black smoke.

Though the flames were formidable, the ghosts were too many; within moments, they would extinguish the flames and charge toward Luotian and Yeye Chen.

“Little Tian, let me see your current strength!” Beneath the crimson mask, Xue Mian’s cold eyes softened. His sword danced as he fought a humanoid ghost; if Luotian faltered, he’d intervene without hesitation.

“Is that white-haired one the one who escaped from Hell?” Wu Mian stood atop the wall, gazing at Xue Mian.

“Roar…” In an instant, Luotian and Yeye Chen were engulfed by ghosts, vanishing from sight.

“Done for! Those two are doomed!” Baitian City’s people whispered, knowing Luotian and Yeye Chen were certain dead.

“Move aside!” Yechen roared, punching toward Qiuqiandi.

“He’s dead!” Qiuqiandi replied, ignoring Yechen’s fist and grabbing it.

“Qiuqiandi has grown stronger!” Yeling stood among the group, unassuming yet his eyes flickered.

“Regrettable Luodanshi’s demise; such talent, slain by ghosts!” Baitian City’s people bore confusion.

Ke Duanshan stood atop the wall, hands on his sword, gazing through mist at Wu Mian. His expression was grave.

As for Luotian and Yeye Chen’s fate, Ke Duanshan cared not; to him, Luotian was merely a strong warrior. He might rescue him on a whim but would not seek it out, for the opponent was Wu Mian—comparable to an Immortal King.

“Why has Wu Mian emerged?” Ke Duanshan murmured, Wu Mian’s strength surpassing his own and matching Baitian City’s Lord.

“That commander seems capable!” Wu Mian stood atop the black wall, his voice carrying amusement.

“Furnace of Heaven’s Fire!”

“Starry Great Law!” As people assumed Luotian and Yeye Chen were doomed, two authoritative voices echoed. The ghostly horde halted instantly.

“Boom…” Thunderous roars resounded, black stones plummeting from the sky toward Luotian and Yeye Chen.

“Roar…” Many True Immortal Endings’ ghosts were crushed into black smoke by the stones.

“Boom…” A surge of flames, like a storm, spread outward, annihilating True Immortal Endings’ ghosts.

Luotian and Yeye Chen’s surroundings became a vacuum, reappearing in sight, causing Baitian City’s people to gasp.

Not only Baitian City but also Hell’s side, Wu Mian and others bore surprise—never expecting Luotian and Yeye Chen to resist under such conditions.

“You make me die, I’ll not die!”

“I’m no pushover either!” Luotian roared, gazing at Xue Mian above.

“Soul-Controlling Seal! Come forth!” Luotian barked, hands forming seals. The Moon of the Demon rose, invisible waves radiating from him instantly.

“Ugh…” The waves immediately caused True Immortal Level ghosts to fall, trembling; the wave felt like a divine decree.

Wherever it reached, all ghosts trembled, gathering around Luotian in moments.

“It’s him!” Wu Mian’s eyes flickered, his body shifting instantly to recognize Luotian.

“It is!” Ke Duanshan’s face shifted, gazing at the Soul-Controlling Seal above Luotian.

“Kill them!” Luotian pointed, and True Immortal Endings’ ghosts roared, charging toward the True Immortal Initiates.

“What’s happening?” Baitian City’s people were stunned, gazing at Luotian and Yeye Chen amidst the ghosts, and the warring ghosts.

“Wu Mian!” Luotian caught his breath, eyes flashing violet as he saw Wu Mian through the mist. His heart clenched violently!

“Go!” Luotian had intended to command ghosts toward Hell City for show, but upon seeing Wu Mian and his powerful figures, he trembled. Though long past, Luotian hadn’t forgotten Wu Mian’s strength and the fear he commanded.

“My heavens, how did Luotian Dashi manage it? To control ghosts!” Baitian City’s people were stunned, even Thousand and Ten-Thousand Commanders shocked.

“Stop him!” Wu Mian spoke softly, his voice transmitting; True Immortal Initiates roared toward Luotian.

“Not personally, it’s manageable!” Luotian’s eyes flashed, watching the approaching True Immortal Initiates. He spoke harshly.

“Shooting Sun Bow!” Luotian called, golden spiritual energy forming three arrows on the bow.

“Crack…” The bowstring was drawn, golden arrows vanishing into the sky, piercing three True Immortal Initiates.

“Boom… Boom…” The three ghosts exploded instantly.

“Die!” Luotian growled, continuously drawing and firing arrows; streaks of light rose, each flash eliminating a True Immortal Initiate.

“Three… ten…” Soon after, over twenty ghosts charging toward Luotian were annihilated.

“Go!” Luotian didn’t linger, grabbing Yeye Chen’s arm and joining Huozhen and others, walking calmly toward Baitian City.

“Don’t run!” Wu Mian watched Luotian leave, extending a finger toward them.

A black finger surged forward, crushing space and appearing behind Luotian and Yeye Chen in an instant. Their faces darkened.

Immortal King’s Strike!

People gasped, watching the black finger—uncontrollable fear swept through all.

“Buzz…” Ke Duanshan moved instantly upon Wu Mian’s gesture, golden spiritual sword blazing with ten thousand lights. If Luotian hadn’t caught Ke Duanshan’s eye before, now he had the qualification to be protected.

“Buzz…” The sword of opening heaven pierced space, its might destroying the heavens and earth, instantly arriving above Luotian’s group.

Chapter 2025: The Hell’s Killing List ()

Golden spiritual energy collided with the black finger, shattering the dark sky with thunderous roars.

“Puke…” Luotian and Yeye Chen spat blood, their bodies swept by terrifying waves, flying upward.

“Immortal King’s Strike! How fearsome!”

“It feels like it can alter the heavens and earth, leaving no resistance!” Luotian quickly stood, leading them toward Baitian City.

“Retreat!” Ke Duanshan bellowed after Luotian and others returned to Baitian City.

A clear sound rang out; Ten-Thousand Commanders and Thousand Commanders ceased fighting ghosts, flying toward Baitian City.

These commanders were at least True Immortal Mid-Stage; eight of them reached True Immortal Peak. Thus, to retreat, they needed Wu Mian’s intervention—otherwise, even a half-Immortal King would struggle to stop them.

Soon after, Xue Mian and others returned to Baitian City, reappearing in sight.

“Xue Mian!” Luotian’s eyes flashed with icy fury; Xue Mian’s actions had crossed his line, filling him with murderous intent.

“Endure! My strength isn’t enough yet!” Luotian internally consoled himself, trying to stay calm.

“Ten-Thousand Commander, you’ve schemed against me, a lowly soldier—doesn’t that seem unreasonable?” Though Luotian could endure, Yeye Chen couldn’t. Upon entering Baitian City, he roared loudly; if not for Ke Duanshan’s presence, Yeye Chen would have cursed.

“Rumors…” People gasped upon hearing Yeye Chen’s words, gazing at him in disbelief. They never expected Yeye Chen to question a Ten-Thousand Commander within the military camp.

“Don’t you want to die?” Yefu and others thought coldly upon hearing Yeye Chen’s outburst. Other sect geniuses also sneered.

“Ah?” Upon hearing Yeye Chen’s outburst, Xue Mian’s eyes flickered with amusement, gazing at Yeye Chen.

“You claim I schemed against you—what proof do you have?”

“I, a Ten-Thousand Commander, would scheme against you? A lowly soldier—just one word from me and you die. Do you think you’re the heir of Star River Sect here, so you can act freely?”

“Xue Mian, don’t overstep!” A Ten-Thousand Commander stepped forward, eyes cold as he gazed at Xue Mian.

“Ten-Thousand Commander Ye Cheng!” People gasped, gazing at the middle-aged man in blue robes.

“Overstepping? Ye Cheng, I grant you face; I won’t argue with these two. It’s their own death!” Xue Mian spoke coldly; though both were Ten-Thousand Commanders, Xue Mian’s fame was greater.

“Ah! Ye Cheng is from Star River Sect!” Upon seeing Ye Cheng step out, people realized.

Most in Baitian City were from the Nine Immortal Mountains under Baitian Mountain; Star River Sect had many within Baitian City.

“Enough! Let it go!” Ke Duanshan spoke solemnly, his gaze sharp as he looked at Xue Mian and Ye Cheng.

“Yeye Chen, this isn’t Star River Sect; it’s Baitian City. Upon arriving here, you must abide by Baitian City’s rules. Even if your father Ye Wudao comes, he must obey me!”

“Consider my favor for your uncle, who was once Baitian City’s Deputy Lord. I won’t trouble you, but if you persist in being unreasonable, I’ll kill you to uphold military law. Let’s see what Ye Wudao can do!” Ke Duanshan spoke coldly.

“I…” Ye Wudao was frightened by Ke Duanshan’s gaze, losing his composure and silently gritting his teeth.

“Don’t say more; we can’t argue!” Luotian spoke to Yeye Chen, his face calm. A strong dragon doesn’t dominate a local area; in Baitian City’s domain, Ye Wudao couldn’t act freely. Moreover, Luotian vaguely suspected Ke Duanshan was a direct lineage of Baitian Mountain.

“Kid, come with me!” Ke Duanshan grabbed Luotian again, vanishing from sight.

…

“Speak—what you just used was the Soul-Controlling Seal, right?” Ke Duanshan led Luotian to a hall, gazing at him with deep eyes.

“Yes.” Luotian nodded; he couldn’t hide it from Ke Duanshan.

“Indeed!” Ke Duanshan’s face slightly shifted, but he quickly recovered, gazing at Luotian with subtle intent.

“Do you know the consequences of using the Soul-Controlling Seal?” Ke Duanshan spoke, voice solemn.

Seeing Ke Duanshan’s solemnity, Luotian’s face slightly shifted; he didn’t know the consequences of using the Soul-Controlling Seal, but seeing Ke Duanshan’s expression, he realized his recklessness.

“You can use the Soul-Controlling Seal—this means you possess the Ghost Valley’s Token!”

“Though the Ghost Valley’s Token is bound to its master, others can still seize it. Once gathered, one may obtain the true inheritance of the Ghost Valley’s Master!”

“Though your actions seem to have earned great merit, everyone in Baitian City witnessed it. From what I know, the Nine Immortal Mountains have someone with the Ghost Valley’s Token; Baitian City’s sect members aren’t foolish. They’ll surely deduce you possess the Ghost Valley’s Token. Those with the token will inevitably seek you out, killing and seizing it!”

“Those who possess the Ghost Valley’s Token are all geniuses. I don’t know others, but Ye Shengshan’s disciple Nie Yuntian from Eternal Life Mountain is a token bearer. If he learns of your token, he won’t let you live!” Ke Duanshan spoke with amusement.

“Damn it…” Upon hearing Ke Duanshan’s words, Luotian cursed internally; never expected using the Soul-Controlling Seal would bring such trouble.

“Eternal Life Mountain, Nie Yuntian—wasn’t he Nie Sheng’s father?” Luotian mused, then gazed at Ke Duanshan.

“Commander, I am your soldier; you must help me!” Luotian shouted, knowing Ke Duanshan had summoned him for another reason.

“You are my soldier!” Ke Duanshan’s eyes flickered, then sighed deeply.

“In Baitian City, I can protect you, but outside it, I cannot. Though our Baitian City is strong, we can’t reach the Nine Immortal Mountains!” Ke Duanshan spoke softly.

“Enough! Thank you, Commander!” Luotian bowed slightly; he knew Ke Duanshan protected him due to the Soul-Controlling Seal’s ability to control ghosts. Otherwise, Ke Duanshan wouldn’t risk angering Eternal Life Mountain’s disciple.

“Hmph, what I want you to do is enhance your strength and enter the True Immortal Realm asap. Control True Immortal ghosts!”

“I’ll grant you certain privileges—freely choose to go out or stay within the city for battles!”

“Your task is half a year—enter True Immortal. If not, I’ll abandon you, as it’s too long; Baitian City can’t wait!” Ke Duanshan spoke solemnly, his voice resolute.

“Yes!” Luotian nodded; he was nearly a half-True Immortal. In half a year, entering True Immortal—impossible for others, but achievable with effort.

“Good. Here is a True Spirit Pill to help you enter half-True Immortal. As for entering True Immortal, you must find your own way; I know you’re a Dashi! Also, Baitian City’s merit exchange place has many treasures. If you have merits, even seventh or eighth-grade spiritual pills can be exchanged!” Ke Duanshan gazed at Luotian deeply.

“Merits!” Luotian’s eyes flickered; Ke Duanshan clearly implied merits could obtain anything.

Luotian possessed the Soul-Controlling Seal, making obtaining merits easy—so easily that even Thousand Commanders might gain less than him.

“Return!” Ke Duanshan spoke softly, no further words; Luotian bowed slightly and exited the hall.

Walking through the courtyard, due to garrison duties, the Eighth Army’s compound was unusually vast. As Luotian passed a golden palace, his eyes gradually gained coldness—the palace’s owner was Xue Mian.

“Someday, I’ll overturn your palace!” Luotian spoke solemnly, then exited the inner courtyard, arriving at the Thousand Commander’s location, returning to his residence.

“Luotian and Yeye Chen, for quelling chaos, awarded ten thousand merits—voluntary participation in battles!” Upon Luotian returning to his small courtyard, Ke Duanshan’s authoritative voice echoed in the battle zone.

“What? What kind of reward is this?” Upon hearing Ke Duanshan’s authoritative voice, the Eighth Army people gasped in astonishment. Never expected such a reward.

“Haha, you all work hard! I’ll rest first!” Yeye Chen’s face lit up upon hearing Ke Duanshan’s command, surprised by the sudden happiness. The near-death experience had made him realize Hell’s terror.

“Damn it!” Yefu and others’ faces darkened; never expected Ke Duanshan to issue such a command. If Luotian and Yeye Chen didn’t leave Baitian City, they’d miss their chance…

“Buzz…” On the other side, Hell also issued a command—more like adding a name. The Hell’s Killing List now bore Luotian’s name.

The Hell’s Killing List featured those renowned in Baitian City, like Ke Duanshan and other commanders, some Thousand Commanders—also on the list.

With Luotian added to the list, Baitian City received news; all faces shifted slightly.

“Who is Luotian? Why is he on the Hell’s Killing List?” Not only the Eighth Army but other armies also stirred.

Chapter 2026: Striving for Half-True Immortal ()

With Luotian’s name on the Hell’s Killing List, Baitian City trembled; people curious about who Luotian was.

As stories spread, Luotian’s past deeds circulated in Baitian City—his method of making ghosts turn on each other was astonishing.

“Controlling ghosts—this technique seems familiar!”

“This must be the Soul-Controlling Seal! Report to the sect!” Some quickly deduced Luotian’s method was the Soul-Controlling Seal, contacting their sects.

“Hence why Hell added Luotian to the Killing List—possessing the Soul-Controlling Seal, he could turn the tide!” People realized why Hell sought to kill him.

Yet Luotian remained indifferent, seated on his bed with three pills in hand—three True Spirit Pills, seventh-grade spiritual pills.

One was given by Ke Duanshan; the other two were exchanged with all his merits.

Yeye Chen stood outside Luotian’s room, cautious; he’d heard of the Soul-Controlling Seal and knew these days Luotian might not be peaceful.

“All merits exchanged for these two True Spirit Pills—will they let me smoothly enter half-True Immortal? I’ve been at the True Immortal Peak for a long time!” Luotian murmured, then swallowed the three pills.

“Boom…” Upon entering his mouth, the pills’ fierce energy surged through Luotian’s meridians and into his dantian.

“Great!” Luotian felt immediate satisfaction; due to Baitian City’s ghostly air suppressing spiritual energy, cultivation was slower here. Yet resources were abundant—merits allowed faster strength growth than elsewhere. This is why many wanted to join Baitian City, despite its 70-80% death rate.

Risking life for resources—opportunity lurked in danger.

For Luotian, one True Spirit Pill’s value was immeasurable; yet in Baitian City for three months, he exchanged two—unthinkable elsewhere.

No time to think further; Luotian immediately cultivated the pills’ energy.

Previously, he was near half-True Immortal; golden-black spiritual pills had seven cracks—entering half-True Immortal was natural.

Three days passed, as Luotian cultivated the True Spirit Pills, several figures arrived outside the courtyard, faces arrogant, spiritual energy radiating.

They exchanged glances, eyes filled with hostility but no words; they approached Luotian’s courtyard.

“Luotian, come out!” A youth in blue robes shouted loudly, startling Yeye Chen.

Yeye Chen stood at the gate, his expression stiffened; he straightened and cautiously watched the youths.

“Luotian isn’t here!” Yeye Chen replied softly, sighing inwardly that the courtyard’s barrier was strong—otherwise, this shout would’ve disturbed Luotian’s cultivation.

“Zhou Cang, Jiang Xuan…” Yeye Chen recognized them instantly, his expression more tense.

Though he hadn’t met these youths before, he’d heard of their names—each hailed from the Nine Immortal Mountains, renowned within them. Though not direct disciples, they were heirs of the Nine Immortal Mountains, their family status rivaling Star River Sect’s in Baitian Mountain.

Their families’ power was stronger than ordinary middle-three sects, though not as formidable as Star River Sect.

“Yeye Chen? The Star River Sect’s spoiled brat?” Upon seeing Yeye Chen, they too recognized him, surprise on their faces.

“Luotian isn’t here—leave!” Yeye Chen shouted, though these youths were geniuses from the Nine Immortal Mountains, he still maintained his arrogance.

“Move aside! A middle-three sect’s disciple dares block our path—what are you? Think Star River Sect is so mighty?” A youth spoke, voice disdainful.

If it were Qin He Feng and others here, they might have hesitated slightly; but Yeye Chen’s spoiled brat reputation was known across the middle-three sects, seen as trash.

“Exactly! Think you’re something? Forgot where this is—Baitian City, not Star River Sect. Be sensible and leave; I’m saying this for Yeye Wudao’s sake. If not, you’d be kneeling now!” Another youth spoke loudly.

“Go to hell!” Yeye Chen’s face darkened upon hearing their words, no hesitation—his hand flung out a talisman.

As dozens of talismans flew, thunderous roars echoed in their ears; stars fell from the sky, each radiating powerful waves capable of subduing True Immortal Peaks.

“You dare attack!” Their faces shifted; never expected Yeye Chen to strike first, using a high-level spiritual technique.

“Attack? This is self-defense! We’re in the Eighth Army, under Commander Ke Duanshan’s domain. You dare come here to cause trouble—this is self-defense!” Yeye Chen spoke with righteousness, defending his home.

Rogues sometimes achieve what others can’t—like Yeye Chen.

Military camps forbade spiritual techniques; others dared not, but Yeye Chen did—because everyone knew he was a rogue. If he used it, people would assume his nature.

Others couldn’t; if they did, people would see it as breaking military law. Moreover, Yeye Chen’s words were valid—these youths weren’t part of the Eighth Army.

“Boom… Boom…” Yeye Chen kept attacking, talismans flying from his hands like worthless paper, yet each was priceless.

“Yeye Chen, are you done?” They fled in panic, yelling; who knew Yeye Chen would start fighting without warning, giving no chance to fight back.
