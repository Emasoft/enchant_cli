“Let me go… Let me go…” Although Xiao Qian was subdued by Ji Jiu You, his small hands were still busy, constantly tugging at him. The most unfortunate was Ji Jiu You’s beard.

“Sleep!” Ji Jiu You’s lips twitched. Then, a streak of gray light burst from his third eye, instantly penetrating Xiao Qian’s mind. Xiao Qian immediately ceased struggling, his small eyes slowly closing as he fell into a deep sleep.

“With me!” Ji Jiu You waved his hand, and the sleeping Xiao Qian instantly flew toward Pofan.

“Seal…” Ji Jiu You’s hands emitted a series of seals, which merged into Xiao Qian’s body.

“Crash… crash…” After the three of them embedded their seals into Xiao Qian’s body, his figure suddenly expanded violently. Gray mist surged forth, instantly transforming him into a towering ancient tree.

Gray mist surrounded the tree’s body. Its leaves resembled countless gray faces, appearing extremely terrifying.

“Go!” The three of them shouted in unison. Surging gray mist completely obscured their vision. At the same time, Ji Jiu You’s group wore solemn expressions.

“Seal…” A humming resonance echoed. Three-colored radiance rose from their hands. After another quarter of an hour, the surging gray mist gradually calmed down. A gray tree-shaped mark was imprinted upon Pofan, who was wrapped in the aura of Fu Xingxuan.

“That kid will surely be shocked when he returns!” Ji Jiu You smiled slightly, speaking softly.

Gutian Shu and Dongbo Xin watched Ji Jiu You. They secretly sighed, knowing they must never offend this old immortal. He would scheme against you in every way possible, and you wouldn’t even realize it.

Under the crimson starry sky, Luo Tian and his companions flew continuously toward the Demon Domain.

But Luo Tian had no idea that this trip to the Shura Domain was entirely unnecessary, as Ji Jiu You simply didn’t want him to be too idle.

“Big Brother, why don’t we take the transmission array?” Chen Zhanbiao looked puzzled, gazing at Luo Tian.

“To check on Long Jie and see how he’s been living these years. It would also be good to visit the son of the Epoch Lord of the Demon Domain!”

“Also, transmission arrays are too conspicuous. We should stay low-key and avoid causing chaos!” Luo Tian smiled slightly, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao. He would never admit he had a trauma toward transmission arrays.

“Indeed, Big Brother is truly smart!” Chen Zhanbiao felt that Luo Tian’s words made perfect sense, his face showing admiration as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“Zhanbiao… it’s really simple to fool him. There's no sense of accomplishment at all!” Luo Tian smiled inwardly.

Their speed was fast, and they quickly exited the Fire Domain, entering the Demon Domain. Upon entering, Luo Tian’s face showed a series of admiration—after all, it had been quite some time since he last visited the Demon Domain.

“Demon Domain’s Holy City!” Luo Tian’s feet shimmered, and he took a step forward toward the core of the Demon Domain—the direction of the ancient Holy Clans’ city.

Chapter 1543: Dawn of the Demon (Yao Chen)

“Indeed, it has changed a lot!” Luo Tian led Chen Zhanbiao and Sun Mengru through the bustling streets of the Holy City. As they entered, Luo Tian sensed several powerful auras. Among them were two that even made Luo Tian feel a shiver of awe.

Luo Tian’s face showed a smile. He sensed a powerful aura approaching their street, and it was none other than the current undisputed Domain Lord of the Demon Domain—Long Jie.

“Big Brother!” Luo Tian’s smile hadn’t faded when a solemn voice echoed in their ears.

“It's the Dragon Emperor!” The people on the street immediately stood respectfully, gazing at a solemn figure descending from the sky.

“Good!” Luo Tian saw the respectful glances in people’s eyes and knew Long Jie managed the Demon Domain well.

“Your strength has increased. If it weren’t for my own opportunities, I might have been surpassed,” Luo Tian said with admiration, gazing at Long Jie approaching them.

“Big Brother, don’t mock me!” Long Jie smiled slightly and embraced Luo Tian tightly.

Luo Tian habitually patted Long Jie’s head, causing the people of the Holy City to gasp in astonishment, their faces filled with disbelief.

“Who is that person? How dare he treat the Dragon Emperor like this, and yet the Dragon Emperor didn’t even resist!” People immediately started murmuring, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Familiar…”

“He’s Luo Tian! Luo Tian has arrived in our Holy City!” The people around immediately erupted into a commotion, gazing at Luo Tian with expressions of shock.

“Exactly! Who else could make the Dragon Emperor act like that!” The people around looked at Luo Tian with reverence.

In the past, the fierce beasts of the Demon Domain had strongly despised Luo Tian because he had nearly made a name for himself by trampling the Demon Domain. However, after several events occurred, the fierce beasts changed their view of Luo Tian. Especially after Feng Clan’s betrayal and Long Jie's rule over the Demon Domain, there was no longer any hostility toward Luo Tian.

Fierce beasts revered strength. Luo Tian’s power and his astonishing victories had completely earned their respect.

“Big Brother, come with me to the Dragon Clan. It’s been a long time!” Long Jie smiled and bowed respectfully toward Sun Mengru.

“Good wife! Zhanbiao, it’s been a while!” Long Jie looked at Chen Zhanbiao. His identity was no longer ordinary.

“Long Jie, do you have any food? Bring me some grilled chicken wings. I haven’t had grilled wings in a long time!” Chen Zhanbiao’s mouth watered as he spoke to Long Jie, then gazed around.

The people immediately felt a chill. They looked at Chen Zhanbiao, their mouths twitching as they recalled his past achievements—someone who ate everything.

“…”

Not only were the people speechless, but even Luo Tian and Long Jie felt equally at a loss.

“Zhanbiao…” Luo Tian didn’t know how to respond to Chen Zhanbiao, feeling a bit apologetic toward Long Jie.

“Haha, Zhanbiao, let’s go. I’ll make sure you eat until full!” Long Jie laughed and patted Chen Zhanbiao’s shoulder, then led Luo Tian into a grand hall.

Soon, someone brought over wine and food. Long Jie had also increased the meal size, preparing multiple portions to let Chen Zhanbiao eat his fill.

“Big Brother, if you hadn’t come, I would have gone to the Four Sacred Star Domains to visit you. The son of the Ancient King was killed by you, right? Tell me how you did it!” Long Jie looked at Luo Tian with the same admiration he had as a child.

Luo Tian smiled, recounting his battle at the entrance of the Netherworld. He also explained about his curse and the sacred medicine he needed, telling Long Jie everything without holding back. Naturally, he hoped Long Jie could help.

Long Jie’s brows furrowed, then he spoke softly: “Other sacred medicines I don’t know where they are, but I do know where Dragon Mist Ice is.”

“Oh?” Luo Tian’s face lit up with joy. He hadn’t expected to find a clue for one of the sacred medicines so quickly.

“Inside the Dragon Tomb of the Dragon Clan, there is a Dragon Mist Ice! I’ll discuss it with the Dragon Clan and take Big Brother to search for it!” Long Jie spoke softly, his expression indifferent. Now that he was the Dragon Emperor and the undisputed Domain Lord of the Demon Domain, his word carried weight.

“Where is Master Diaoyu now? I also want to visit him later!” Luo Tian’s eyes held a smile, not forgetting Master Diaoyu’s kindness.

“Old Man is fine. He has been in seclusion within the Dragon Tomb, trying to advance further!” Long Jie smiled at Luo Tian.

“Advancing further!” Upon hearing Long Jie’s words, Luo Tian’s eyes twitched. He naturally understood the implication behind Long Jie’s words.

Luo Tian had left before, and Master Diaoyu was at the end of the Epoch. After so many years, Luo Tian didn’t believe Master Diaoyu’s strength hadn’t improved. Now, if he wanted to advance further, it was obviously aiming for the position of Epoch Lord.

“Indeed a great event!” Luo Tian spoke softly, clearly hoping Master Diaoyu would succeed.

“There’s also the son of the Epoch Lord of the Demon Domain who has awakened. Where is he? I want to see him too, since our two factions are on good terms!” Luo Tian continued, his face showing anticipation.

“Luo Tian, you’ve finally arrived!” Just as Luo Tian’s words were spoken, Cao Dezhu’s voice echoed from outside the hall. Accompanying him was Yan Jun, a man of extraordinary beauty.

After the reconciliation between the Four Sacred Star Domains and the Demon Domain, the Star Dragon Ant Clan had also returned to the Demon Domain. Over these years, their development was rapid, and they had become one of the eight Holy Clans in the Holy City—becoming a core force under Long Jie’s command.

Two figures, one black and one purple, rushed into the hall with haste. However, their appearances were somewhat poor. Cao Dezhu was slightly better off, his robes a bit disheveled. Yan Jun, however, looked quite pitiful—his handsome face had two bruises, and a large bump protruded from his forehead.

“What happened to the two of you?” Luo Tian’s face showed a look of confusion. Both had good talent, and Luo Tian could sense their Epoch Peak energy levels. Yet they looked so disheveled in the Holy City of the Demon Domain, which puzzled him.

“Sigh…” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s question, Cao Dezhu sighed deeply, his face showing a lonely and melancholic expression. His aura also became strangely unstable.

“Luo Tian, I was so lonely without you! No one in the Demon Domain is my match except for the Dragon Emperor. I heard you killed two sons of Epoch Kings in the Netherworld, so I felt a bit restless. I decided to fight against the son of our Epoch Lord!” Cao Dezhu crossed his arms and spoke softly.

“Another one starting to show off!” Luo Tian looked at Cao Dezhu’s demeanor and knew his habits. He smiled.

“I fought against the son of our Epoch Lord, Yao Chen. His strength was formidable—my only match besides you and the Dragon Emperor. We fought for three days and nights, and I finally defeated him with one move!” Cao Dezhu spoke softly, his voice containing a hint of regret.

“Shut up…”

“You said we’d fight together, but you ran faster than anything!” Yan Jun couldn’t bear it anymore and spoke out.

“I was trying to train you!” Cao Dezhu looked at Yan Jun with the gaze of an elder toward a junior.

“Cao Dezhu, you little bastard! You left me alone to be beaten. Now you’re here showing off!” Yan Jun gritted his teeth, gazing at Cao Dezhu standing proudly.

“Enough, the two of you stop arguing!” Long Jie smiled and intervened to calm them down.

“Yao Chen is our Epoch Lord’s son. You’ve seen his strength. Cao Dezhu and the two of you have been beaten quite a bit recently!” Long Jie spoke softly, his face showing a faint smile.

“Yao Chen’s heart isn’t bad. But he has one major problem—he loves to fight with people. Since he awoke, he’s fought through the entire Demon Domain. If his opponent was weaker, he would seal his own strength and fight on equal terms! Even I couldn’t escape. So Big Brother, I advise you not to meet him. It’s really annoying!” Long Jie smiled and rubbed his forehead.

“Exactly! Big Brother Luo, look at what he did to me!”

“You don’t know how it was. That Yao Chen didn’t have any opponents, so he focused on us two. At first it was one-on-one, then one-on-two. Cao Dezhu is a scoundrel who ran too fast and couldn’t even keep up with Yao Chen!” Yan Jun rubbed his head’s big bump, looking like a woman in despair as he spoke to Luo Tian.

“You’re not one of the good ones either!” Long Jie looked at Cao Dezhu still standing there and kicked him.

“Ouch…”

“Dragon Emperor, I didn’t want to! You know how strong Yao Chen is. Even you couldn’t control him. How could I be his match? If I didn’t run, I’d just get beaten too!” Cao Dezhu, whose image was ruined, started yelling loudly.

“Such a fierce fighter! It’s quite interesting!” Luo Tian smiled. Although he was curious, after thinking about it, he decided not to meet Yao Chen—his time was limited and he didn’t want to waste it on unnecessary battles.

“Hmph?” Cao Dezhu sniffed, then his eyes showed confusion. He gazed at the outside of the hall: “Why do I smell a terrible scent?”

Chapter 1544: Power

“What scent?” Upon hearing Cao Dezhu’s words, Luo Tian, Long Jie, and Yan Jun all showed confusion. They gazed at Cao Dezhu, who had a strong sense of smell.

“Damn it, it’s that monkey!” Cao Dezhu’s face slightly changed, recognizing the familiar scent.

“Monkey? You mean…” Upon hearing Cao Dezhu’s words, Yan Jun’s face also changed slightly. His eyes showed anger.

“Boom… boom…” Before Yan Jun could finish speaking, the hall’s door suddenly burst open. A strong figure appeared in Luo Tian and his group's view.

“You two ran here, huh? Hmph, the Dragon Emperor is also here. Let’s fight a few moves!” A loud voice echoed in the hall, and a strong figure stepped into the hall. His tone carried an air of dominance.

With a sharp mouth, high cheekbones, and wearing golden robes with his chest exposed to reveal a strong body covered in thick golden fur. His eyes glowed with intense gold light, and his aura was overwhelmingly strong. He carried a dark iron staff on his shoulders, though its material was unknown, it was definitely not ordinary.

“You… you actually came here!” Cao Dezhu immediately looked like a deflated balloon, hiding behind Long Jie. He gazed at the well-furred young man.

“Yao Chen, don’t be reckless. We have guests today!” Long Jie was also a bit exasperated. He hadn’t expected Yao Chen to be drawn in by Cao Dezhu and Yan Jun.

Thinking of this, Long Jie couldn’t help but glare at Cao Dezhu and Yan Jun, the two culprits. Then he spoke to Yao Chen: “Go back first. I have guests here. I’ll fight with you another time!”

“Guests?” Yao Chen showed his teeth, scanning Luo Tian, Chen Zhanbiao, and Sun Mengru with his eyes. His golden eyes flashed like two suns.

“You’re Luo Tian, right?” Yao Chen spoke softly. His voice carried a strong fighting spirit. An invisible aura radiated from him, pressing toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Sigh…” Upon seeing Yao Chen's overwhelming fighting spirit, Long Jie sighed deeply. He knew it wouldn’t be easy to end this.

“I heard you killed a few sons of the Ancient Kings. That means you’re strong, right?” Yao Chen smiled slightly and spoke to Luo Tian.

“Yes, I have killed a few sons of the Ancient Kings,” Luo Tian nodded and smiled back.

“Come on, let’s fight!” Yao Chen rubbed his hands together. His body flashed with golden light and rushed toward Luo Tian.

“You dare to hurt my Big Brother! Ask me first!” Before Luo Tian could respond, a thunderous voice echoed. Chen Zhanbiao wiped his mouth and took a step forward, instantly appearing in front of Luo Tian. His large fist swung out toward Yao Chen.

“Crack…” Thunderous sounds echoed in the hall. A violent wave of energy radiated from their collision, shaking the hall as if it might collapse.

“Step back… step back…” Chen Zhanbiao and Yao Chen both took a few steps back. Their eyes were filled with excitement.

“Haha, you’re strong. Let’s fight! My two favorite things are eating until full and then fighting!” Chen Zhanbiao rubbed his numb fists, smiling foolishly.

“Haha, I’m different. My favorite thing is only one—fighting! It’s been a long time since I met such a strong opponent. Let’s go somewhere else, this place is too cramped!” Yao Chen laughed loudly, his eyes filled with strong fighting spirit as he spoke to Chen Zhanbiao.

“Yao Chen, don’t be reckless. They are guests!” Long Jie scolded Yao Chen, his face slightly upset.

“It’s fine, it’s fine… what guests? There’s a fight to be had!” Chen Zhanbiao smiled carelessly and stretched his shoulders.

“Go!” Yao Chen’s face was filled with excitement. He waved his hand, and the displacement force took effect on everyone.

“Look at this!” Luo Tian smiled and spoke to Long Jie, who was angry. He didn’t resist the displacement force.

“Good!” Long Jie nodded. He never argued with Luo Tian’s words. Everyone disappeared from the original spot.

“Hum…” The humming resonance echoed, and in a moment, they appeared under a starry sky—this was the small world created by the Demon Domain’s people.

“Come on!” Yao Chen, filled with fighting spirit, emitted a series of booming sounds from his body. His entire form was golden light, like a war god, rushing toward Chen Zhanbiao.

“Alright…” Chen Zhanbiao laughed loudly. His voice echoed under the starry sky. His tall figure rushed toward Yao Chen.

“Crack…” The next moment, they collided again. Their bodies flew back, and both of their eyes showed excitement.

“Again!” They laughed in unison, stopping at the same time. Their feet stepped on the stars and rushed toward each other again.

In awe, Luo Tian and others watched as two figures continuously clashed under the starry sky. Each collision caused a vast stretch of stars to collapse.

Chen Zhanbiao, as the son of the蛮神 (Fierce God), had a body unmatched by anyone. There was once a figure in the蛮族 (Fierce Race) who had achieved the Blood Clash and reached the轮回体 (Reincarnation Body), such as Zhongli Tian. Chen Zhanbiao’s body was naturally unmatched.

Yao Chen's body, in the confrontation with Chen Zhanbiao, did not show any damage. This left Luo Tian’s face filled with amazement.

“Is Yao Chen really a monkey?” Sun Mengru looked at the two figures clashing and felt shocked. She sensed their bodies had reached their limits. Even Luo Tian’s Reincarnation Body couldn’t suppress them.

“Indeed, he is a monkey. But I don’t know what kind! I also once sparred with Yao Chen, and even my body found it difficult to withstand his attacks!” Long Jie said with admiration, speaking to Sun Mengru.

“Yes, this guy’s body is too变态 (abnormal). Only Luo Tian, Long Jie, and Zhanbiao can withstand it. Even I found it hard to bear!” Yan Jun looked委屈 (disheartened), rubbing his head’s bump.

“Yan Jun, I’m not saying this to you. Your ancestor was also a great being of the Epoch Lord. Your bloodline is unusually rich, yet why is there such a gap between you and him?” Cao Dezhu frowned and spoke to Yan Jun.

“Cao Dezhu, you said you were lonely, so go fight with him!” Yan Jun looked at Cao Dezhu with disdain.

“Master Cao doesn’t want to take advantage of others!” Cao Dezhu smiled and replied. In terms of verbal sparring, Cao Dezhu had few rivals—except for Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi.

“Enough, the warm-up is over!” As Yan Jun was about to respond, Yao Chen’s voice echoed again under the starry sky. His aura burst forth, and he took down the black long staff on his back.

“Good, good, good!” Chen Zhanbiao nodded. His entire body radiated excitement. His hands flashed with waves, and he also produced a black long staff, which was remarkably similar to Yao Chen’s.

“Coincidence!” Yao Chen’s eyes flickered. His black long staff emitted a series of dark light, and golden seals erupted from his hands, covering the dark staff. The staff turned golden.

“Hum…” A series of humming sounds echoed under the starry sky. Yao Chen soared into the air, like a god bathed in divine light. He raised his staff high.

In an instant, a shocking aura rose from Yao Chen’s staff—lifting thousands of jin (a unit of weight), the golden staff swept downward toward Chen Zhanbiao.

“Zhanbiao, be careful!” Luo Tian felt a sense of crisis under Yao Chen’s overwhelming attack.

“Don’t worry! Let it go!” Chen Zhanbiao laughed loudly. His thick arm bulged with veins, and his black long staff emitted a series of dark light. His aura surged skyward. He raised both hands to block Yao Chen’s overwhelming attack.

Before Chen Zhanbiao’s words had finished, under Luo Tian and others’ eyes, Yao Chen’s staff smashed onto Chen Zhanbiao’s raised long staff.

“Crack…” A thunderous sound echoed under the starry sky. The collision of two long staffs instantly filled the stars with cracks. Chen Zhanbiao spat blood and fell downward, his black long staff flying out of his hands.

Yao Chen was no better off. Golden divine blood spewed from his mouth, and he flew backward. His golden staff uncontrollably flew away.

“Abnormal!” Cao Dezhu’s lips twitched. He looked at Chen Zhanbiao falling downward and Yao Chen flying back, speaking in a trembling voice.

“Both of them have mastered the essence of power. If I hadn’t had the Feathered Immortal Scripture, I wouldn’t have been able to withstand Yao Chen’s attack!” Yan Jun also spoke softly.

“Haha… it was a pleasure!” A loud laugh echoed under the starry sky. Yao Chen’s figure appeared in Luo Tian and others’ view, his entire body covered with cracks that rapidly healed.

“Again!” Chen Zhanbiao also appeared at the same time, his body covered with terrifying cracks. A series of wild energies radiated from Chen Zhanbiao’s body, and a deep rumbling sound echoed within his body. His body began to grow slowly.

“Big Brother…” Long Jie’s face showed concern, fearing that the two battle enthusiasts might not hold back and suffer serious injuries.

Chapter 1545: Battle-Striving Holy Ape

Under the black starry sky, two long staffs—black and golden—constantly collided. Each collision caused a thunderous sound in Luo Tian’s ears, as if the mirror-like starry sky was broken, filled with countless cracks.

Chen Zhanbiao and Yao Chen shouted continuously. Their bodies were filled with powerful fighting spirit, fully demonstrating the essence of power. Even Luo Tian was amazed.

“Prepare! At the critical moment, we’ll stop them!” Luo Tian watched as the two of them gathered their strength again. He didn’t interrupt but tensed his body, ready to act at any moment.

“Hmph!” Long Jie nodded heavily. He watched the two figures clashing endlessly, as if they had no limits, like undefeated war gods.

“What kind of monsters are these? Why are they so abnormal!” Yan Jun looked shocked. He himself had a strong body, but seeing Chen Zhanbiao and Yao Chen’s battle, he felt he was still a step behind.

“Probably only Luo Tian and the Dragon Emperor could withstand their body attacks!” Cao Dezhu also looked shocked, but he was also impressed by Yan Jun’s strength. He had endured so long against Yao Chen, and his strength was not weak.

“Haha… it was a pleasure…” Yao Chen laughed continuously. His golden staff did not stop, and his entire body became excited, fighting with endless energy.

“Haha, be careful. I’ll increase my strength now!” Chen Zhanbiao was no worse than Yao Chen, speaking loudly. At the same time, the figure of the Fierce God rose behind Chen Zhanbiao.

“Fierce God’s Wrath Shatters the Heavens!” Chen Zhanbiao roared, his gray foot shaking the heavens and earth. With supreme energy, he stomped toward Yao Chen.

“Ah! You are the son of the Ancient King’s Fierce Race!” Yao Chen looked at Chen Zhanbiao’s tall figure, his face slightly changing.

“Did he just realize it?” Upon hearing Yao Chen’s words, Luo Tian felt speechless.

“Since Yao Chen awoke, he hasn’t cared about anything else. So he didn’t know that Zhanbiao is from the Fierce Race!” Long Jie smiled, looking at Yao Chen’s golden light and spoke softly.

“Yao Chen might be about to reveal his true form. I believe you’ll be shocked!” Long Jie spoke again, his voice playful as he looked at Luo Tian.

“Roar…” As Long Jie’s words were spoken, a loud roar echoed under the starry sky.

A roar shook heaven and earth. Golden light fell upon Yao Chen’s body, and his figure gradually expanded. Golden light transformed into golden armor covering his body. At the same time, Yao Chen’s head turned into a monkey.

“Familiar…” Chen Zhanbiao looked confused, gazing at the monkey clad in golden armor and radiating a terrifying aura. He muttered to himself.

“Dragon Emperor!” Luo Tian’s face slightly changed as he saw Yao Chen’s true form. His eyes showed disbelief. The scene of Yao Chen revealing his true form was almost identical to the moment when the Dragon Emperor appeared under the Five Elements Mountain.

“Unbelievable! I almost mistook him when I first saw Yao Chen’s true form!” Long Jie said with admiration, speaking to the shocked Luo Tian.

“Indeed, it’s very similar. Yao Chen must have a connection with the Dragon Emperor!” Luo Tian looked at Yao Chen, who radiated terrifying energy. He pondered internally.

“Master Gu and Master Ji both said that the four of us survived our second life because of a remarkable person. Could this person be the Dragon Emperor?” Luo Tian thought to himself.

“But what is the relationship between the Dragon Emperor and Yao Chen? Yao Chen is the son of the Epoch Lord. So who is the Dragon Emperor?” Luo Tian’s eyes gradually became shocked, thinking of a terrifying possibility. He shook his head and suppressed the thought.

“Boom… boom…” The powerful sound pulled Luo Tian back. Unknown to what secret method, Yao Chen had expanded to the same height as Chen Zhanbiao. His golden staff suddenly grew, like a pillar reaching to the heavens. He pushed it toward Chen Zhanbiao’s big foot.

The thunderous sound of the attack echoed again in Luo Tian and others’ ears. Chen Zhanbiao’s thick foot collided with the golden staff.

A violent wave of energy instantly sent both figures flying back. At the same time, Luo Tian and others opened a barrier to block the wave of energy pushing toward them.

“Fierce God’s Third Stomp Shatters Stars!” The tall figure rose again from the violent waves. Chen Zhanbiao seemed to have entered a certain state, forgetting they were just sparring and fully immersed in the battle.

Yao Chen showed no signs of yielding. His eyes flashed with intense divine light, and he seemed to have entered a state as well. His blood appeared to burn with fire, his aura terrifying and filling the sky. His golden-furred fists slowly clenched, and with a single grab, space collapsed. A powerful punch surged toward Chen Zhanbiao.

“Boom… boom…” The entire small world trembled. Both figures flew back again, spitting blood, but their eyes remained bright.

“Again!” Chen Zhanbiao roared and stepped through the cosmos, rushing toward Yao Chen. At the same time, Yao Chen also moved forward. His golden staff radiated ten thousand lights.

“Stop them! I’ll block Zhanbiao, and the two of you will block Yao Chen. These two have gone mad. If they keep fighting, one of them is sure to be seriously injured!” Luo Tian watched Chen Zhanbiao and Yao Chen rushing toward each other. He spoke to Long Jie and Sun Mengru.

“Good!” Long Jie and Sun Mengru nodded simultaneously. They didn’t argue with Luo Tian’s opinion. After all, if Chen Zhanbiao went crazy, no one else could stop him except Luo Tian and Xu Liyi. Yao Chen was the same; he would only respect Long Jie.

“Fierce God’s Third Stomp Shatters the Heavens!” Chen Zhanbiao roared again. Supreme energy radiated from his body, as if a king had returned. His massive foot, covered with complex Fierce Race patterns, crushed the stars and heavens, emitting a destructive wave toward Yao Chen.

“One Staff Shatters Heaven and Earth!” Yao Chen held his staff with both hands. His golden fur flared, and a terrifying fighting spirit radiated from him. He gradually concentrated it into his golden staff.

“Roar…” Nine golden seal dragons roared out, circling around the staff. The entire world trembled.

The overwhelming power of the nine dragons wrapped around the golden staff, collapsing stars and heavens. It was supreme, as if only this golden staff remained in the entire starry sky. Slowly, it swept toward Chen Zhanbiao.

“They’re really fighting for real!” Cao Dezhu and Yan Jun looked shocked, gazing at the two figures about to collide.

“Zhanbiao, stop!” At the same time, Luo Tian and Long Jie rushed to the middle of the two. Luo Tian roared at Chen Zhanbiao.

“Manifesting the Universe!” Luo Tian’s body suddenly expanded, and he stomped toward Chen Zhanbiao with one foot.

“Yao Chen!” Long Jie roared. Dragon aura surged, and he transformed into his true form. Golden imperial dragon energy spewed from his mouth. His massive body flew toward Yao Chen, instantly shrinking to wrap around Yao Chen’s body.

“One Sword Questions the Primordial!” A golden divine sword flew from Sun Mengru’s hands. It suddenly expanded and rushed toward the slowly descending golden staff with a humming sound.

“Boom… boom… boom…” Thunderous sounds echoed in the small world. The black starry sky instantly began to crack, as if the entire small world would collapse.

The void currents kept swirling. Luo Tian and others disappeared from Cao Dezhu and Yan Jun’s view, leaving them with open mouths.

“This…” A gust of wind blew against their bodies. However, they seemed to feel nothing.

The storm kept swirling for a full quarter of an hour before finally calming. Several disheveled figures appeared in Cao Dezhu and Yan Jun’s view.

“Big Brother…” Chen Zhanbiao returned to his normal size, looking regretful as he gazed at Luo Tian’s battered face.

“Nothing serious!” Luo Tian took a deep breath, wiping the blood from his lips. After all, he had intercepted Chen Zhanbiao and wasn’t fighting him to the death. He couldn’t use his full strength, otherwise it would be meaningless.

Yao Chen’s face glowed with a radiant light. He smiled, satisfied. This battle had been the most enjoyable since he awoke.

“Luo Tian, let’s fight again!” Yao Chen looked at Luo Tian beside Chen Zhanbiao. His eyes flashed with strong fighting spirit.

“Another time!” Luo Tian looked at Yao Chen’s overwhelming aura. His lips twitched slightly, inwardly sighing that he might be troubled by this monkey in the future.

“Why fight? All day long, you just want to fight!” Long Jie also had blood on his lips and scolded him.

“Ah… sorry, I got too excited. When I met an opponent who was my match, I just couldn’t help it!” Yao Chen scratched his head, showing a slight sense of shame.

“Alright, everyone is fine. That’s enough!” Luo Tian spoke softly and had a better understanding of Yao Chen's character.

“Yao Chen, what race are you?” Luo Tian asked softly, addressing the question in everyone’s mind.

“Ah… you’re all strong. You deserve to know my race! Today I had a great fight, so I’ll tell you!” Yao Chen smiled proudly and looked at Luo Tian and the others.

“My father, the Dragon Emperor, is a rare race of Battle-Striving Holy Ape!” Yao Chen spoke softly and put away his black staff.

“Battle-Striving Holy Ape!” Upon hearing Yao Chen’s words, Long Jie, Cao Dezhu, and Yan Jun all changed expressions.

Chapter 1546: Entering the Dragon Tomb

“Indeed, it is a Battle-Striving Holy Ape!” Yao Chen smiled slightly. He was satisfied with their expressions.

“Battle-Striving Holy Ape? What is it?” However, Luo Tian then spoke, causing Yao Chen’s slightly proud expression to change instantly.

“Can it be eaten?” Chen Zhanbiao also spoke softly, causing Yao Chen’s expression to darken. He almost choked.

“Battle-Striving Holy Ape is a race born for fighting. Fighting is their nature, but they are also very rare. I never expected the Epoch Lord of the Demon Domain, Dragon Emperor Tian, to be a rare race!” Long Jie looked amazed. This was the first time he had heard Yao Chen reveal his race.

“Now I understand why it was said that the Epoch Lord Dragon Emperor Tian reached the position of Epoch Lord through fighting. It must be his nature!” Luo Tian looked amazed, marveling at how such a race could still have descendants. It was truly bizarre.

“Ah! I see now!” Cao Dezhu said, his face showing a mix of admiration and confusion. “Yao Chen’s race is the Battle-Striving Holy Ape!”
