Huangshan, one of the Nine Immortal Mountains, was hailed as the imperial clan of humanity. The Fu family's lineage was formidable; it was said that the surname Fu originated from a primordial deity, the Human Emperor Fuxi. The Eastern Immortal Mountain had also produced numerous formidable figures, such as the current leader of the Eastern Immortal Mountain, Donghuang Taiyi.

Around the two groups stood numerous women clad in revealing attire, their expressions devoid of surprise as they observed the confrontation between the two factions, as if it were an everyday occurrence.

"Two of you, what is it that you wish to say? Please refrain from causing a disturbance within Zuiyue Pavilion, lest it affect the business of this establishment," Zhou Jianxun said with a faint smile, addressing Nie Sheng and Fu Bei. His tone was neither submissive nor defiant.

"Ha! So it's you, Captain Zhou. I'll grant you this favor, but I have one demand—today, Zuiyue Pavilion is mine!" Nie Sheng spoke coldly, his body radiating an icy aura.

"Luotian!" As Nie Sheng surveyed the surroundings, he suddenly spotted Luotian among the crowd and let out a startled exclamation, his gaze filled with disbelief.

"Hmm?" Upon Nie Sheng's outburst, the crowd turned their eyes toward Luotian.

"Yao Ming Eight Guardians?" Zhou Yuansun also spotted the Yao Ming Eight Guardians standing behind Luotian, his eyes narrowing as he stepped toward him.

"Luotian! I never expected to meet you again! Truly, our paths are cursed!" Nie Sheng's face twisted with a sneer, his heart pounding with exhilaration.

Chapter 2302: The Buddha Sect

"You eight, what are you doing here?" Zhou Jianxun's eyes turned icy. The Yao Ming Eight Guardians were renowned within the Zhongtian Consortium, having executed countless impossible missions in the past. However, they had later been punished and assigned to the son of the Consortium's leader, who was notoriously inept. Zhou Jianxun knew these details well; their presence here suggested they had defected from the Zhongtian Consortium.

Realizing this, Zhou Jianxun's expression turned colder, his aura of a half-step Immortal King spreading outward to envelop Luotian and the Eight Guardians. His subordinates also locked their gazes upon them.

"I took them in after their master perished in Bountiful Heaven City," Luotian said softly, a hint of amusement in his gaze.

"Luotian, I was about to seek you out. Unexpectedly, you've come to me! Your current state suggests you've truly succumbed to madness! Today, I shall mete out justice in the name of heaven!" Before Zhou Jianxun could speak, Nie Sheng bellowed, his voice laced with excitement.

"Ah?" Upon hearing Nie Sheng's words, Luotian's heart tensed. He had not expected Nie Sheng to dare address him thus.

"Mind-Devouring Magic!" Luotian silently activated his Mind-Devouring Magic, intending to issue a warning. However, upon activating it, his expression abruptly shifted.

"Ah…" Nie Sheng roared, dark energy surging from his body, yet he suffered only a moment of pain without sustaining any real harm.

"How is this possible!" Luotian exclaimed, stunned. This was the first time he had encountered a failure of Mind-Devouring Magic; he could not sense any demonic seeds within Nie Sheng's body.

"Ha! I never thought you'd dare speak to me like this!" Nie Sheng panted heavily, his eyes brimming with arrogance. "I am an unparalleled prodigy!"

"Mind-Devouring Magic! That was the technique of the legendary Mind-Demon Elder, who once caused chaos in the Immortal Realm. It was only through the intervention of Bountiful Heaven Immortal King that he was finally eradicated!" The onlookers' faces turned pale, their gazes toward Luotian now imbued with new intensity.

"An evil cultivator, so young yet possessing such power—was he enhanced by Mind-Devouring Magic?" Zhou Jianxun muttered低声.

"Come with me," Zhou Jianxun said, his gaze fixed on Luotian.

"I am the disciplinary elder of Bountiful Heaven Mountain. Though I am an evil cultivator, it was out of necessity," Luotian said softly, his gaze sweeping over the crowd. He had not anticipated this situation would draw attention to himself.

"Such a person must be eliminated!" Other sect disciples shouted, their gazes filled with anger.

"Disciplinary elder of Bountiful Heaven Mountain!" Zhou Jianxun's expression slightly shifted. Initially, he had assumed Luotian was merely a common disciple of Bountiful Heaven Mountain; even if he were a prodigy, Zhou Jianxun had the authority to apprehend him. However, now he realized Luotian was a disciplinary elder—despite being an evil cultivator, Bountiful Heaven Mountain had already acknowledged him.

"How did he break free?" Luotian ignored the others' words, his gaze fixed on Nie Sheng. He could not fathom how Nie Sheng had managed to break Mind-Devouring Magic; previously, Maque had stated that even an Immortal King of eternal life could not break it.

"Luotian, today I shall mete out justice and eradicate you here!" Nie Sheng bellowed, his hands glowing with divine light as a long sword materialized in his grasp.

"Interesting," Fu Bei crossed his arms, initially expecting a battle with Nie Sheng. However, the emergence of a disciplinary elder had changed his expectations.

"Back then, you defeated me through underhanded means. Today I shall see how you fare! Once I kill you, I'll proceed to the Central Three Heavens and eradicate the Dragon Ascension Sect!" Nie Sheng's face twisted with madness. For years, he had cultivated while seeking a way to break Mind-Devouring Magic. After all, nothing was absolute. His perseverance had finally paid off—through twin cultivation with women, he had siphoned the power of Mind-Devouring Magic through their offspring.

"Zhu..." The next moment, Nie Sheng launched his attack, rushing toward Luotian without regard for it being the Nine Heavens City. His hatred had rendered him reckless; he would crush Luotian beneath his feet to wash away his humiliation.

Nie Sheng's speed was astonishing, and he instantly appeared before Luotian, slicing through the void with a blade of emerald light that materialized above Luotian's head.

"I am no longer the man I was!" Luotian's eyes gleamed with amusement as his spear, "Rip the Heavens," materialized in his grasp. He raised it to meet the emerald blade.

Back when he had fought Nie Sheng, they were evenly matched. However, Luotian now felt confident in defeating Nie Sheng effortlessly.

"Crack..." The collision echoed, and the entire hall trembled violently. Luotian remained standing as if time had frozen, a furious gust of wind radiating from their clash.

"Rustle..." Objects within the hall were overturned, and the women clad in revealing attire displayed expressions of shock. Their garments were blown about, offering a feast for the onlookers.

"Indeed, his strength has improved significantly...可惜!" Nie Sheng's face bore a faint smile as he gripped his sword and pressed downward.

"Two of you, if you are to fight for your lives, do not do it here," Zhou Jianxun's expression shifted slightly. He leapt in front of Luotian, his sword sweeping out to clash with Nie Sheng's blade. The thunderous collision echoed again, and Nie Sheng was forced back two steps.

"Luotian, dare you ascend the Nine Heavens' arena?" Nie Sheng's eyes regained a sliver of clarity as he bellowed at Luotian.

"Can the Nine Heavens' arena take lives?" Luotian sheathed his spear, having lost all interest in Nie Sheng. Initially, he had believed Nie Sheng was a pawn he had left behind at Eternal Life Mountain; however, it seemed he had underestimated Nie Sheng. If the Nine Heavens' arena could take lives, Luotian would not mind eliminating Nie Sheng to reclaim a fraction of the debt he owed from Heavenly Path Mountain. Previously, in the Lower Three Heavens, Luotian had dared not kill Nie Sheng for fear of a devastating retaliation from Eternal Life Mountain. However, now that he was an elder of Bountiful Heaven Mountain, he no longer feared retribution.

"Indeed, the Nine Heavens' arena is where disciples of the Nine Immortal Mountains settle their disputes. It allows for killing," Zhou Jianxun said, his gaze fixed on Luotian. Nie Sheng knew this, but Luotian was encountering it for the first time; he did not yet know Luotian's background.

"Very well, then the Nine Heavens' arena!" Luotian nodded, choosing to avoid unnecessary trouble by ensuring Eternal Life Mountain could not find grounds for retaliation.

"Let's go!" Nie Sheng sneered, rushing out of the hall and toward the center of Nine Heavens City. Soon, he stood upon a golden arena.

"Luotian, come and face your death!" Nie Sheng bellowed, his aura radiating an overwhelming presence. His voice echoed, and he brandished a massive sword, gazing at Luotian with an unyielding gaze.

As Nie Sheng's voice rang out, a crowd swiftly gathered below the Nine Heavens' arena. Their gazes were filled with curiosity.

"Is it Nie Sheng, the direct disciple of Eternal Life Mountain? His father is the eldest disciple of Eternal Life Immortal King, Nie Yuntian! Who dares offend such a person?" The onlookers' faces turned pale, their gazes sweeping the crowd to see who dared challenge Nie Sheng in the Nine Heavens' arena.

"Why are you shouting so loudly? You're eager to die, I'll grant your wish!" Luotian chuckled softly and stepped onto the arena.

"Brave to ascend! Who is this person who dares challenge Nie Sheng in the Nine Heavens' arena?" The crowd erupted, their gazes now fixed on Luotian.

"An evil cultivator!"

"He is not only an evil cultivator but also wields Mind-Devouring Magic!" The disciples of the Nine Immortal Mountains murmured, their gazes filled with disbelief.

"Two of you, why must this enmity continue? Let us turn swords into plowshares!" As Luotian just stepped onto the arena, a gentle voice echoed in both his and Nie Sheng's ears.

A bald young man stood upon the arena, his head marked by four precepts scars. His body was wrapped in a gray robe, and he clasped his hands together, addressing Luotian and Nie Sheng.

"Monk?" Luotian's eyes narrowed slightly, his gaze filled with confusion as he looked at the bald young man.

"Blind monk! What are you to me? I'll deal with this myself!" Nie Sheng sneered, his gaze however slightly wary.

"This monk is no ordinary man," Luotian thought to himself, the young monk's aura making him uncomfortable. His demonic energy stirred within his body, attempting to counteract the young monk's oppressive aura.

"This is Nine Heavens City; those who have arrived here are mostly disciples of the Nine Immortal Mountains. Who is this young monk?" The onlookers were also puzzled.

"Have you forgotten? Among the Nine Immortal Mountains, there is one entirely composed of monks—Sumeru Mountain!" A young man spoke, his eyes filled with astonishment.

"Sumeru Mountain? How could that be? Sumeru Mountain has not emerged in years. How can this monk be from Sumeru Mountain?"

"I recall, Sumeru Mountain sends a young disciple down to the world every century for training!" Someone exclaimed, causing the crowd to realize.

"Ah! It's a high-ranking monk from Sumeru Mountain!" Nie Sheng, upon hearing the crowd's murmurs, changed his expression rapidly and bowed to the young monk.

"I believe both of you carry strong bloodlines, especially this one—already fallen into the path of evil. However, it is not deep yet. Please come with me and embrace the Buddha's teachings, reciting sutras daily to purify your demonic energy!" The young monk addressed Luotian with a gentle gaze.

The monk's voice seemed to carry an unusual mystique, evoking no aversion but instead a sense of sanctity.

"High-ranking monk! This person is unfit to enter your Buddhist sanctuary. Let me kill him myself; such an evil cultivator should not be left alive!" Nie Sheng sneered, his sword gleaming with cold light.

"Indeed, I am unfit to enter Sumeru Mountain. Please, good sir, depart so as not to soil your attire with blood!" Luotian spoke coldly but kept his gaze fixed on the young monk.

Chapter 2303: Slaying the Divine

"I seek to save others, to guide them from evil and toward virtue. Please come with me, lest you harm both yourself and others," the young monk smiled, persisting in his entreaty to Luotian.

"High-ranking monk! This person should be left to me; he has already succumbed to the path of evil. Let me eliminate him, for such an evil cultivator is a threat to all!" Nie Sheng bellowed, finally ceasing his words and raising his sword toward Luotian.

The emerald blade surged forward, shaking the heavens, causing the onlookers' faces to pale in fear.

"Kill me? Let's see if you have the ability!" Luotian spoke coldly, summoning his spear "Rip the Heavens" and sweeping it to meet the emerald blade.

"Crack..." In an instant, the emerald blade exploded above Luotian's head. He remained unmoved, standing as if time had frozen, allowing the furious winds to swirl around him.

"Now it's my turn!" Luotian's cold voice echoed, his body vanishing from sight. His black spear shattered the void and descended with overwhelming force.

"Get out of my way..." Nie Sheng roared, raising his sword to meet Luotian's spear. Upon collision, Nie Sheng's face instantly turned pale, as if struck by a mountain. A force he could not resist sent him flying backward, blood spewing from his mouth.

He flew over thirty feet before stopping, his face pale and eyes filled with disbelief.

"How strong!" Nie Sheng's heart roared in fury. Their brief clash had revealed he was no match for Luotian. Nie Sheng could not fathom how Luotian had become so powerful. Back when they had clashed at the Dragon Ascension Sect, Nie Sheng had been subdued but remained defiant.

Today's encounter had made him believe he could crush Luotian beneath his feet, for years of hardship had fueled his desire for revenge.

To Nie Sheng's mind, Luotian was merely a boy who had risen from the Lower Three Heavens. How could he compare to his resources? He believed he could easily crush Luotian.

"Nie Sheng has been bloodied by him!" The onlookers' eyes were filled with shock as they watched Luotian standing there, smiling.

Fu Bei's eyes narrowed; he had also not expected Luotian to be so formidable. He and Nie Sheng had long been at odds, engaging in silent rivalry. Now that Luotian had bloodied Nie Sheng with a single strike, Fu Bei realized he was no match for Luotian either.

"Again..." As the crowd marveled, Luotian's cold voice echoed again, his body moving like a shadow.

"Boom..." The heavens trembled as three black spear shadows converged, descending with overwhelming force toward Nie Sheng.

"Ah..." Nie Sheng roared, gripping his sword's hilt with one hand and its back with the other. He gritted his teeth to meet the crushing black dragon.

"Boom..." The Nine Heavens' arena trembled violently, Nie Sheng's feet shattering stones that collided with the rising barrier.

Nie Sheng spat blood, his palms cracked, and he collapsed to the ground, trembling violently.

"Not bad!" Luotian stood there, gazing down at Nie Sheng as he had once done in the Dragon Ascension Sect.

"Zhu..." The black spear was raised again, Luotian's eyes cold as he slammed it downward.

"Run..." Nie Sheng growled, in a life-or-death crisis, his body twisted and vanished.

"Boom..." The spear struck the ground, causing another tremor in the massive arena.

"Your body was strong back then; I never thought it would become even stronger!" Nie Sheng panted heavily, his hands moving rapidly as a green door emerged from the heavens. The heavy aura made Luotian's face finally show a ripple of emotion.

"Ah! The Eternal Life Gate!" Luotian recognized Nie Sheng's martial art instantly. However, this time it was far stronger than before.

Green inscriptions adorned the green Eternal Life Gate, radiating an overwhelming aura as it descended upon Luotian.

Luotian's eyes gleamed with amusement, his hands moving swiftly as the Hellish Torture Claws emerged. The black claws carried an icy aura, rushing toward the green gate.

"Boom..." The two martial arts collided instantly, as if a thunderclap had split the sky. Nie Sheng spat another mouthful of blood.

"Life Sacrifice!" Nie Sheng's eyes flashed with resentment, his blood transforming into crimson inscriptions. The sight was astonishing even to Luotian, whose eyes narrowed slightly.

The crimson inscriptions carried an eerie aura, turning the green gate into gray. A terrifying pressure made Luotian's face grow serious.

"Manifesting the Dao of Heaven and Earth!" Luotian's hands formed a seal, his body exploding in size to form a thousand-zhang figure. His mighty step descended upon the gray gate.

The thunderous sound echoed across the heavens, but Luotian's massive body took two steps back. Yet the gray gate seemed unshakable.

"Stronger than before!" Luotian took another step, each footfall shaking the heavens.

Boom... Boom...

After Luotian's fourth step, the gray gate finally shattered under his might, dispersing into a surge of vitality across the Nine Heavens' arena.

"This could withstand it?" Nie Sheng was stunned. That attack had been his strongest, a technique born from his life force. It had cost him a century of vitality.

"If you have no other tricks, you may as well die!" Luotian's cold voice echoed in Nie Sheng's ears, making his face pale. A black cloud appeared above Nie Sheng's head—Luotian's final step.

"Boom..." The heavy pressure made Nie Sheng's heart beat erratically, and a sense of helplessness enveloped his mind.

The combination of the Heaven-Devouring Dao and the Ultimate Immortal's pressure trapped Nie Sheng in a quagmire. He wanted to escape but was too late.

"He truly dares to kill me!" Nie Sheng's eyes widened in disbelief, never expecting Luotian to actually kill him. However, he soon realized that Luotian was no longer the same as before; he had become an elder of Bountiful Heaven Mountain, his status no less than Nie Sheng's within Eternal Life Mountain.

"Finished..." Nie Sheng's eyes filled with despair. He had some tricks left, but it was too late to use them. He could only watch as the black shadow loomed larger and larger.

"Zhu..." Just as the final step was about to strike Nie Sheng, a pure white light suddenly rose. A pristine hand extended from above Nie Sheng's head.

The white hand held back Luotian's attack, making his face slightly shift.

"High-ranking monk!" Nie Sheng felt as if he had been saved, his eyes filled with joy. He vanished from the scene.

"Master, do not be too deep in evil; let me recite sutras for you daily to purify your demonic energy," the young monk addressed Luotian, his voice gentle.

"..." Upon hearing the monk's words, even Luotian was speechless. He had been bloodied by Luotian but still sought to save others.

"Let's go!" Luotian ignored the monk's words, addressing his Hellscape Eight Guardians and stepping toward the center of Nine Heavens City. He had no more desire to linger in Nine Heavens City now.

At the moment Luotian killed Nie Sheng, news spread to Eternal Life Mountain as Nie Sheng's jade tablet shattered.

"Who dares kill my son, Nie Yuntian!" A furious voice echoed, a roar that shook the heavens.

"What? Nie Yuntian's disciple was killed?" The entire Eternal Life Mountain trembled.

Eternal Life Mountain had once eradicated the Heavenly Path Sect, and since then it had taken a leading position among the Nine Immortal Mountains. Disciples of other sects would usually look down upon Eternal Life Mountain's disciples, avoiding conflicts with them.

A middle-aged man appeared in the intelligence hall of Eternal Life Mountain, his body wrapped in a green robe. His eyes glowed with divine light, and an aura of authority radiated from him. This man was Nie Yuntian, the eldest disciple of Eternal Life Immortal King.

"Find out who killed my son!" Nie Yuntian barked at the old man in charge of intelligence. The old man wiped his forehead, drenched in sweat. Eternal Life Immortal King had spent a lifetime pursuing eternal life and had no children, adopting only three disciples. Nie Yuntian was the most favored among them. Now he had reached the early stage of Immortal King, and it was widely known that Eternal Life Immortal King might pass his throne to him in the future.
