Cen Hongwei was thoroughly disoriented. He had never believed Luo Tian's words before, but Luo Tian had indeed retrieved the Ghost King and four half-step True Immortals. This left Cen Hongwei no choice but to believe him.

"His previous victories were all genuine..."

"One man wiped out thirty thousand disciples and elders of the Disordered Heaven Sect, killed the Supreme Elder Yao Tiancheng, and did so in front of two True Immortals at their initial stage... with only a mid-stage Heavenly Immortal..." Thinking back to Fan Tianming's words, Cen Hongwei felt waves of astonishment. Luo Tian's achievements were terrifying; even his composed nature could not withstand it.

Cen Hongwei had always considered himself a genius among the younger generation, but compared to Luo Tian's record, he was far behind.

"Let's go... Perhaps there will be trouble later. Remember to protect me!" Luo Tian patted Cen Hongwei's shoulder for the first time. Those who knew Luo Tian understood this was a sign of recognition; when Cen Hongwei had rushed in despite knowing he couldn't match the Ghost King, Luo Tian had already acknowledged him.

Luo Tian snapped Cen Hongwei out of his daze, but he still followed Luo Tian in a haze, muttering internally that with the Ghost King and four half-step True Immortals guarding him, what need was there for protection?

"Luo Tian! It really is you. You still haven't given up, coming back for those ghosts!" As the two exited the cave, disciples shouted angrily at them. When the Ghost King was sealed within the Soul-Controlling Seal, the Disordered Heaven Sect immediately knew it had vanished.

"This was originally mine. I'm just reclaiming my belongings. What's the problem?" Luo Tian's face showed disdain. If these disciples were unreasonable, he would give them another lesson.

"Move aside! I'm leaving!" Luo Tian sneered and strode toward the hall where Li Changfeng and others were meeting.

The disciples of Disordered Heaven Sect still dared not block them. They hadn't dared before, and now that Luo Tian had retrieved those ghosts, they were even more afraid.

"Timid cowards!" Luo Tian thought with a cold smile, leading Cen Hongwei out of the crowd.

"Son, return. There's something urgent!" As they just stepped out of the crowd, Li Changfeng's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

Chapter 1876: No Victory, Only Death

In the hall of Disordered Heaven Sect, Luo Tian and Cen Hongwei returned. As they entered, the people in the hall immediately turned their gazes toward them.

"Son, you've truly overstepped. Do you think Disordered Heaven Sect is your home? You stole those ghosts!" As they entered, Fan Tianming immediately shouted, breathing heavily with concealed killing intent. Though temporarily reconciled with the Heavenly Dragon Sect, Fan Tianming still deeply hated Luo Tian.

"What ghosts? I don't know about them. Elder Fan, you can't just spread nonsense. You're clearly trying to stir up hostility between the Heavenly Dragon Sect and Disordered Heaven Sect!" Luo Tian feigned innocence, countering.

"You... you..." Fan Tianming pointed at Luo Tian, speechless with anger, nearly choking on his own blood.

"I... what? Elder Fan, from the moment I arrived at Disordered Heaven Sect, you've always targeted me. As a mid-stage Heavenly Immortal, I'm just one finger away from death in your presence. Why bother with so much talk?" Luo Tian spoke loudly, confidently.

Cen Hongwei's lips twitched as he watched Luo Tian spout nonsense so boldly, feeling him even more shameless. Yet for some reason, he felt secretly pleased seeing Fan Tianming humiliated.

"Enough... step back!" Li Changfeng finally couldn't bear it, scolding Luo Tian. Then he addressed Fan Tianming: "Elder Fan, don't take it so personally. If you can produce evidence, I'll certainly give you an explanation!"

Li Changfeng smiled, his words seeming polite but secretly supporting Luo Tian. He subtly implied Fan Tianming had lost dignity by speaking without proof.

"Son..." Fan Tianming and Mei Gueqi gritted their teeth. If looks could kill, Luo Tian would have died countless times already.

"Luo Tian, your eyes can't kill. Earlier when so many disciples of Disordered Heaven Sect stared at me, I didn't have any problems either," Luo Tian smirked.

"Enough! Have you finished arguing? Let's start quickly. After it ends, everyone goes home. No one will care if you die!" Sima Xiū showed impatience.

"Yes..." Li Changfeng glanced at Luo Tian about to speak, signaling him and Cen Hongwei to return behind.

Zhao Ritian looked at Luo Tian as if viewing a deity. He never expected Luo Tian to dare confront True Immortals, let alone silence them.

"Thank you," Cen Hongwei whispered lowly. He knew Luo Tian had done this intentionally, to divert his mind; otherwise, he would have been blinded by hatred again.

"You've given me face. Now let's make you proud!" Li Changfeng's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, making him puzzled.

"Wait... there will be a battle. A life-or-death match!" Before Luo Tian could respond, Li Changfeng's voice made both Luo Tian and Cen Hongwei pause slightly.

With that, everyone stood up and walked toward a battlefield beside the hall.

While walking, Li Changfeng also introduced Cen Hongwei to the battle rules. They had discussed earlier that disciples from three major sects would take turns battling, awaiting challenges from other sects to test their strength. This was how they cultivated their juniors.

If they couldn't even defeat the disciples of other sects, what right did they have to demand others' respect?

"Whoever wins last will face the other two sects' disciples. That's the most crucial part. If you can kill the other two sects' disciples, don't hold back. Their elders would also advise their disciples in the same way," Li Changfeng's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Struggle for Heaven only knows life and death, no victory," Luo Tian muttered. He hadn't even joined the Struggle for Heaven yet, and three major sects were already trying every means to weaken each other.

"Li Piaoxue!" Cen Hongwei gritted his teeth, staring fiercely at Li Piaoxue. This was a good opportunity; he knew under normal circumstances, he had no chance to kill Li Piaoxue of the Earth Dragon Sect.

"Stay focused, don't be careless," Luo Tian spoke to Cen Hongwei. He was worried Cen Hongwei would get overconfident; the most important thing in a battle was to stay calm.

"Alright, stand up!" Li Changfeng addressed Luo Tian, Cen Hongwei, and Zhao Ritian. At the same time, Peng Tiande and Sima Xiū addressed their disciples.

Luo Tian and his companions leaped into the air, standing on the battlefield. The other two sects also stood on their sides, exchanging glances.

The Iron Dragon Sect had two disciples; the Earth Dragon Sect only had Li Piaoxue standing there. When the three groups stood in place, the atmosphere immediately became tense, especially for Cen Hongwei, who stared at Li Piaoxue, clenching his fists.

"Haha, Sima Xiū, you're not getting the advantage this time!" Peng Tiande smiled, seeing the Earth Dragon Sect had only one disciple.

"Master, battle isn't about numbers. Even if there are more people, they're still useless," Li Piaoxue smiled, glancing at Luo Tian's group. On the battlefield, three clearly outnumbered them.

"You..." Hearing Li Piaoxue's words, Cen Hongwei immediately exploded with anger. Even Zhao Ritian's face showed anger.

"Enough arguing. For someone who spews filth, let him eat the shit he's sprayed!" Luo Tian softly comforted them. He looked at Li Piaoxue, who had mastered the art of cursing without using vulgar language. After all, he had once been surrounded by several masters who were champions of verbal duels.

"Brash little brat. When the three sects' battles begin, I'll show you what it means to be worse than death!" Li Piaoxue smiled.

"Start! Now you scum can choose any of the people on the battlefield to challenge. Remember, keep it light, don't hurt feelings!" A senior from the Blood Dragon Sect spoke with a smile.

"I choose the Heavenly Dragon Sect. Who will fight me?" A tall young man stepped onto the battlefield, gazing at Luo Tian's group.

"I also choose the Heavenly Dragon Sect... I also choose the Heavenly Dragon Sect!" As the senior's words just finished, five figures appeared on the battlefield, gazing at Luo Tian's group.

"You!" Li Changfeng's eyes turned cold, looking at the sect masters of the five disciples.

Besides the seven sects, five sects had chosen the Heavenly Dragon Sect. Li Changfeng didn't know if there was a trick, but if he did, he would be a fool.

"It's all part of the rules. Master Li, don't back out!" Fan Tianming smiled, obviously having put in a lot of effort to create this situation.

"Let them fight. Whatever happens, I'll cover for you!" Li Changfeng's eyes held coldness as he transmitted to Luo Tian's group.

Li Changfeng had already realized this was a trap set for the Heavenly Dragon Sect. Since these five sects were influenced by Fan Tianming, there was no need to try to win them over. Now he only hoped that the remaining two sects would be impressed by Luo Tian's group and take interest.

"How to distribute?" Luo Tian asked Cen Hongwei. As for Zhao Ritian, he ignored him outright; Zhao Ritian's strength was good but still a level below those present.

"I'll handle it!" Cen Hongwei's aura of killing spread as he stepped forward, gazing at the five opponents.

"Cen Senior, what are you saying? As a disciple of the Heavenly Dragon Sect, I naturally have to help you. Do you agree, Zhao Senior?" Hearing Cen Hongwei's words, Luo Tian spoke loudly, his voice full of authority.

"This..." Zhao Ritian's lips twitched, but he nodded reluctantly.

"That... the one in red robe. Did you see him? That's my Heavenly Dragon Sect's Zhao Senior. You trash, Zhao Senior can kill you with one slap. If you dare, come on, I'll let Zhao Senior kill you!" Luo Tian jumped up and cursed the Blood Dragon Sect's disciple, sensing this red-robed youth was the strongest among the five.

"Luo Tian, shut up!" Zhao Ritian's face turned slightly as he stopped Luo Tian.

This youth was named Xuetu, a famous genius of the Blood Dragon Sect. If Cen Hongwei was brutal, this Xuetu was cruel!

"Zhao Senior, it's time to show your divine power. It's time to prove yourself as the top disciple of the Heavenly Dragon Sect!" Luo Tian shouted, pushing his spiritual awareness toward Zhao Ritian with great force.

"Stumble... " Zhao Ritian was about to stop Luo Tian but was pushed out by his spiritual awareness.

Chapter 1877: Mistake

"Luo Tian, you bastard!" Zhao Ritian mentally cursed as his body stopped. He looked at Xuetu's dark face.

"Zhao Senior, let us show the might of the Heavenly Dragon Sect!" Luo Tian stood there shouting, pretending not to care about Xuetu.

"Um... Xuetu, let's keep it light. We're all from the Lower Three Heavens. No need to fight to the death!" Zhao Ritian chuckled, addressing Xuetu.

"Good..." Xuetu coldly looked at the jumping Luo Tian and showed killing intent. In his view, Zhao Ritian was in cahoots with Luo Tian.

"Kill..." Next moment, Xuetu moved. His澎湃 spiritual energy radiated like blood, making him look more sinister.

"Ah..." Zhao Ritian saw Xuetu move and shouted. Though he didn't want to fight against Xuetu, he had no choice but to go ahead. He mentally cursed Luo Tian.

"We'll start too!" Cen Hongwei looked at the remaining four, his gaze cold. Though they were strong, he was confident in defeating them.

"Cen Senior, I'm also a disciple of the Heavenly Dragon Sect. I have to contribute to the sect too, right?"

"That... that one with a crooked face. Come here! Let me slap you to death!" Luo Tian shouted, pointing at the thinnest of the four opponents.

"Me?" The thin man's face slightly changed. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to choose him.

"Are you sure?" The thin man smiled, revealing two teeth like mice's.

"Yes, it's you. What are you smiling about? Keep smiling and I'll rip your teeth out!" Luo Tian shouted, his face showing disdain.

"Really asking for death!" The youths smiled slightly. They had five people on stage; Xuetu was the strongest, but because of his cruelty, fighting against him meant no survivors.

This thin man, however, was on par with Xuetu. His name was Qiu Hongyi, a genius of the War Dragon Sect.

Though Qiu Hongyi looked thin, his strength was astonishing. This was because he had another identity: a person who had ascended to the Immortal realm, but not at the same time as Luo Tian's group.

Ascendants were always sought after by major sects in the Immortal realm. Many ascendants had been taken by the Central Three Heavens, even the Nine Immortal Mountains of the Upper Three Heavens. But Qiu Hongyi remained in the War Dragon Sect, which had caused a stir in the Lower Three Heavens.

Indeed, Qiu Hongyi's strength was no less than the top disciples of the three major sects. It was because he had an identity as an ascendant.

"Alright, then I'll show you my skills!" Qiu Hongyi smiled lightly and stepped toward Luo Tian.

Though many people didn't believe in Luo Tian, it wasn't the case with Cen Hongwei. He knew Luo Tian had a True Immortal Ghost King and four half-step True Immortals, which would make anyone except the sect masters unable to match him.

Fan Tianming and Mei Gueqi also didn't believe in Qiu Hongyi. After all, Yao Tiancheng had fallen to Luo Tian. But Fan Tianming's goal wasn't to kill Luo Tian, but to make him offend people. Once he offended enough people, others would act against him.

"Boom..." On the other side, Zhao Ritian had already fought with Xuetu. Blood-red dragons continuously dove down; Zhao Ritian's face was pale, and he kept retreating.

Cen Hongwei roared and stepped forward toward the remaining three. He knew Luo Tian didn't want him to expend too much energy.

"Kill..." Seeing Cen Hongwei rushing toward him, the three disciples didn't dare to be careless. After all, Cen Hongwei's reputation was well-known.

"I choose the Earth Dragon Sect!" A youth with a fresh face looked at Li Piaoyun, his gaze full of respect.

"Senior, please teach me!" The youth addressed Li Piaoyun. He looked inexperienced.

"Don't worry, Senior will certainly teach you properly!" Li Piaoyun smiled gently. Indeed, his name was like drifting clouds, and his smile made people feel comfortable.

"I'll start!" The youth spoke, then a flash of light appeared in his hand. A long sword landed before him and he rushed toward Li Piaoyun.

"Buzz..." At the moment the youth moved, Li Piaoyun also moved. His body vanished from everyone's sight.

"Mind!" The youth's sect master's eyes flickered slightly and he shouted loudly.

"What?" The youth was confused, turning to look at his sect master. But as he turned, he saw a smiling face and his body suddenly trembled.

"Show mercy!" The elder shouted, but before the words finished, a crisp sound rang out. The youth's head tilted sideways and his neck was snapped by Li Piaoyun, who killed him.

"Boom..." Li Piaoyun casually threw the youth's body to the ground, smiling as he returned to his position.

"This..." Everyone's faces showed shock. Li Piaoyun killed the youth quickly and cleanly, even without hesitation when the elder shouted.

"Sorry, I accidentally killed him!" Li Piaoyun smiled, looking at Cen Hongwei who was fighting three disciples alone.

"Good, good..." The elder's face was grim. He collected the youth's body. Previously, Li Piaoyun had been kind, but now he killed a person without hesitation. This made people hard to adapt.

On the other side, an Iron Dragon Sect disciple also stepped forward and fought against the last remaining sect's disciple.

"Rat, did you see that? This is the strength of the three major sects. Li Piaoyun is number one in the Earth Dragon Sect, and I am also number one in the Heavenly Dragon Sect. If you don't want to die, quickly surrender. I hit hard; once I hit, even I'm afraid!" Luo Tian shouted loudly, looking at Li Piaoyun and then addressing Qiu Hongyi.

"I want to see how scary you are!" Qiu Hongyi's eyes showed disdain. He had seen a flicker of anxiety in Luo Tian's gaze.

"No, I have a habit. Before duels with people, I always ask one question: do you want to fight in a civilized way or a martial way?" Luo Tian stood there, addressing Qiu Hongyi.

"What's the difference between civilized and martial fighting?" Qiu Hongyi showed impatience but was drawn in by Luo Tian's method.

"Civilized fighting means being polite. You hit me, I hit you. Whoever falls loses. I usually let the opponent strike first because this is my condition."

"The second is martial fighting, like they do!" Luo Tian pointed to the other chaotic battlefields.

"Haha, I've lived this long and never met such a fighting method before. I choose civilized fighting!" Qiu Hongyi's face showed excitement, thinking about how Luo Tian usually let others strike first.

"Ah, I also like civilized fighting. After all, we're both elites. Fighting so violently would ruin our elite image, right?" Luo Tian smiled.

"According to my rules, since I proposed it, I'll let you strike first!" Luo Tian straightened his posture and looked at Qiu Hongyi.

"Then I won't be polite!" Qiu Hongyi smiled slightly and stepped forward toward Luo Tian, clenching his fists. His aura suddenly rose.

"Crushing Mountain Fist!" Qiu Hongyi shouted, an invisible wave of energy bursting from him. His originally thin body swelled by two sizes. His arms were covered with bulging veins, and an explosive force spread from his arms.

"Master Li, it's unavoidable. The Heavenly Dragon Sect's disciples' intelligence is truly... touching... their intelligence is quite moving..."

"Qiu Hongyi's specialty is his body. When he uses the Crushing Mountain Fist, even a late-stage Heavenly Immortal can be shaken!" The War Dragon Sect's elder smiled proudly, looking at Qiu Hongyi raising his fist.

Qiu Hongyi's face showed ferocity. He looked at Luo Tian, imagining him being smashed into meat paste by his fist.

"Wait..." Just as Qiu Hongyi's aura reached its peak and he was about to strike, Luo Tian suddenly jumped back.

"Cough... cough..." Qiu Hongyi's face turned red. He almost lost his breath.

"What happened?" Qiu Hongyi took a long breath to calm down, showing impatience and asking.

"Fight is merciless. Even though we're fighting in a civilized way, if something happens, it's bad for the family not to know!"

"So, before we start, should we make our wills and leave messages for our relatives..." Luo Tian shouted loudly.

"Yes, it does make sense. Give you some time!" Qiu Hongyi nodded and agreed.

"Thank you. You can also make your wills now, because I'll slap you to death next!" Luo Tian smiled arrogantly and addressed Qiu Hongyi.

"Dear father, mother... I'm currently fighting someone. I'm afraid of accidents so I left this message... it's been years..." As he finished, Luo Tian took out a jade slip and began recording loudly.

"..."

Everyone was speechless watching Luo Tian chatter on. This wasn't leaving a will at all; it clearly showed signs of being a transmission. Luo Tian started by talking about his birth...

"Ah..." A pitiful scream echoed, drawing people's attention to the direction of the scream.

Blood splattered. Xuetu held Zhao Ritian with both hands, pulling him apart and tearing him in two.

"You..." Li Changfeng looked at Xuetu, his eyes bursting with intense killing intent. Zhao Ritian's strength wasn't great, but Xuetu had killed him with such cruel methods. This was like slapping the Heavenly Dragon Sect's face.

"Accident..." Xuetu licked the blood on his lips and spoke to everyone.

Chapter 1878: Playing to Death

"Too shameless!" Hearing Xuetu's words, everyone silently cursed.

Xuetu showed no care, standing aside. He looked at Cen Hongwei's battlefield and then glanced at Luo Tian's direction, as if searching for his next target.

"Dad, when I was twenty, you made me go to the Ice Cave and fuse with the Ice Dragon's soul. That time my strength increased greatly..." Luo Tian stood there, endlessly talking about his past.

"Are you done yet?" Hearing Luo Tian's words, Qiu Hongyi's head almost exploded. If Luo Tian continued like this, it would take a whole day.

"Who's in a hurry? You're so eager to let me slap you to death? Then I'll fulfill your wish!" Luo Tian smiled and straightened his posture.

"That blood-robed one, wait. After I slap this rat to death, I'll come and slap you too. Wait for me!" Luo Tian saw Xuetu heading toward Cen Hongwei's battlefield and shouted loudly.

"Look what you're looking at. You, a good man not to be, still wearing red robes? Do you think you're a woman who's getting married every day?" Luo Tian shouted loudly, his voice full of disdain.

"Okay, I'm waiting for you!" Hearing Luo Tian's words, Xuetu stopped and looked at Luo Tian.

"Come on, hurry up. After I kill you, I'll slap that woman too!" Luo Tian saw Xuetu stop and addressed Qiu Hongyi.

"I'll start!" Seeing Luo Tian finally stood straight, Qiu Hongyi's face showed ferocity. His aura rose again.

"Die!" Qiu Hongyi shouted, raising his fist high.

"Wait!" But just as Qiu Hongyi's fist was about to fall, Luo Tian stepped back again. His eyes showed caution.

"Pu..." Qiu Hongyi's mouth had a stream of blood flowing out. He had forced himself to hold back twice, making him uncomfortable. As for the blood in his mouth, it was unclear whether it was from anger or internal injuries.

"Again... what... happened!" Qiu Hongyi gritted his teeth, staring at Luo Tian and speaking one word at a time.

"If you keep acting unreasonable, I'll choose martial fighting!" Qiu Hongyi gritted his teeth and addressed Luo Tian.

"Ah, no problem. I just wasn't prepared yet!"

"You're also really annoying. Alright, let's do civilized fighting. But you want to back out? Are you an elite? The saying goes, once you've set up the trap, you have to finish it. Look at me, I'm doing civilized fighting... I'm with you..."

At this moment, Luo Tian seemed to be possessed by Zheng Xin, endlessly talking and becoming a chatterbox.

"Quickly prepare!" Qiu Hongyi gritted his teeth, wiped the blood from his mouth, and his aura rose again.

"Alright, let's go!" This time Luo Tian didn't speak. He straightened his posture and stood there.

"I'm starting!" Qiu Hongyi saw Luo Tian standing there, showing ferocity. He looked at Luo Tian and his aura surged dramatically. His fist rose high and rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Die! You bastard!" Qiu Hongyi was delighted that Luo Tian didn't speak. His fists, covered in gray energy, fell toward Luo Tian's chest.

The gray fist reached Luo Tian's chest instantly. Qiu Hongyi sighed in relief.

"Cough... cough..." However, just as the fist was about to touch Luo Tian's chest, Luo Tian coughed lightly.

"Boom..." Next moment, a闷 sound rose from Luo Tian's chest. Luo Tian's body kept retreating, and some blood flowed out of his mouth.

"What happened? He only retreated a few steps?" Everyone was stunned. They hadn't expected Qiu Hongyi to be so weak.

"Idiot!" Qiu Hongyi wanted to vomit blood. He had used his full strength, but Luo Tian's cough made him hold back instinctively. It was because he had already developed a conditioned reflex from the previous two times.

"Haha..."

"Rat, you can only do sneaky things. Come on, let me show you how I'll slap you to death!" Luo Tian laughed and wiped the blood from his mouth. This blood was fake, just a cough.

"Really cunning!" The surrounding sect masters smiled slightly. They thought Luo Tian's strength was definitely not as good as Qiu Hongyi. This method was purely opportunistic.

"Come on, you won't have another chance!" Qiu Hongyi wanted to vomit blood. He glared at Luo Tian with hatred.

"You already don't have a chance because I'll slap you to death!" Luo Tian laughed, his voice full of arrogance.

"Quickly!" Qiu Hongyi was afraid Luo Tian would have another outburst, so he stood straight.

"Since you're so eager to die, I, the top disciple of the Heavenly Dragon Sect's Dragon Battle Rankings and first in the Daoist Competition, will personally end you!" Luo Tian smiled with pride, reciting a string of titles and approaching Qiu Hongyi.

"I'm about to attack!" Luo Tian shouted, raising his hand.

"Pu..." Just as Luo Tian raised his hand, another battlefield had Cen Hongwei wielding a black sword and cutting off a challenger's head, causing people to gasp.

"Accident!" Cen Hongwei coldly spoke and attacked the other two.

"Buzz..." As people were stunned, a golden hand burst with bright light. A powerful fluctuation made people shift their gaze.

"Damn... you're playing..." Qiu Hongyi turned around and felt a strong aura in front of him. He was about to curse, but he was immediately hit back.

"Boom..." Qiu Hongyi's body vanished into a mist of blood in people's sight.

"Sigh..." Luo Tian sighed deeply, looking pitifully compassionate.

"Qiu Hongyi is dead!" People spoke in shock, seeing Qiu Hongyi's corpse on the battlefield.

"I said I would slap him to death and let him leave a will. Now your mom and dad are really sad!" Luo Tian crossed his arms, his expression full of pride. People wanted to stomp on that proud face.

"Despicable! Too despicable! It's clearly a sneak attack, and you act like a master!" Everyone mentally cursed. Even Li Changfeng's face turned red.

"Son, you're cheating!" The head of the War Dragon Sect's face was dark and about to drip water. His eyes were burning with anger, looking at Luo Tian. Qiu Hongyi's value was too great; he died so pitifully.

"Truly great in life, pitiful in death!" People sighed. They also marveled at Luo Tian's shamelessness.

"What kind of cheating? Do I have to wait for the opponent to be ready before attacking? Also, I told him I was about to attack. He didn't listen! Why should I be blamed!" Luo Tian smiled.

"Crack... crack..." The head of the War Dragon Sect's teeth clenched tightly. He wanted to swallow Luo Tian alive, but he couldn't because Li Changfeng was watching him closely. He had no chance to act.

"Alright, next one. That woman, come on... let me slap you to death!" Luo Tian addressed the blood-robed Xuetu, as if he was just an ant to be crushed.

"I choose civilized fighting. Come on! I won't make the same mistake as before!" Xuetu smiled coldly and stepped toward Luo Tian. If Luo Tian nodded, he would mercilessly kill him.

"Ah... well then, are you ready? I won't hold back. The rat before was an example. Do you have any last words? If not, I'll slap you to death!" Hearing Xuetu's words, Luo Tian rubbed his hands.

"What? I didn't go first?" Xuetu's face showed confusion, looking at Luo Tian.

"You're crazy. Since I proposed civilized fighting, I let the opponent strike first. But it was you who proposed it first! I can't be so kind all the time!" Luo Tian showed disdain.

"Kind?" Hearing Luo Tian's words, people's lips twitched. But they also admired Luo Tian for defeating Qiu Hongyi with shamelessness.

"You..." Xuetu's face slightly changed. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to change his mind so quickly.

"Alright, no sneak attacks!" Xuetu's face showed caution as he addressed Luo Tian.

"I've always been honest. I'll tell the opponent before attacking!" Luo Tian smiled, looking at Xuetu.

"Alright, start!" Xuetu's expression was tense. Though Luo Tian's words were pleasant, who knew what tricks he would play.

"I'm about to attack!" Luo Tian smiled all the time, stepping toward Xuetu and slapping him.

"Hmph. Slap me to death? You're still far from it!" Xuetu sneered, his body tensed.

"Buzz..." A golden hand fell. But just as it did, a golden spear landed in the palm. Luo Tian's arm movement also changed abruptly.

"Pu..." The golden spear struck Xuetu's throat precisely, piercing through. Xuetu widened his eyes in disbelief.

"Ugh... ugh..." Xuetu wanted to speak but his face gradually darkened. His life force rapidly disappeared.

"Son, why did you use a weapon!" The head of the Blood Dragon Sect's face showed anger, looking at Luo Tian. His voice was fierce.

"Embarrassing!" At this moment, the head of the Blood Dragon Sect finally felt the embarrassment of the War Dragon Sect's head. His sect's genius was definitely strong, but it had been played to death.

"I can't use a weapon either..."

"Battle, battle. Life-or-death match. Using weapons is stupid! I was confident I could slap that rat to death, but this woman was strong. I had to use the spear!" Luo Tian looked at the Blood Dragon Sect's head with innocence, as if looking at a fool.

"Haha, son, you did it well!" Li Changfeng laughed. Luo Tian had defeated two disciples with his intelligence, which was indeed satisfying.

Chapter 1879: I Truly Am First

Among the crowd at the Disordered Heaven Sect's battlefield, many True Immortals at the initial stage were so angry they spat blood. Especially the heads of the War Dragon Sect and Blood Dragon Sect had already spat blood, their eyes burning with anger as they stared at Luo Tian.

People suddenly felt that Xuetu's previous act of killing and calling it an accident was nothing compared to Luo Tian. Luo Tian had reached the pinnacle of shamelessness.

"Pu..." As people were angry at Luo Tian's shamelessness, bloodlight flashed again. Cen Hongwei's black sword erupted, killing two more challengers.

The crowd gasped. Compared to Luo Tian's shamelessness, Cen Hongwei's strength was terrifying, forming a sharp contrast. Luo Tian became a mere companion to Cen Hongwei's strength, everything serving to highlight Cen Hongwei's power.
