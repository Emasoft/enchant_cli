“Wum…” Just as the formidable warrior turned, a blade’s aura materialized behind him, causing his expression to shift slightly.

“If you seek death, I shall grant it!” The elder suddenly spun around, his hand snatching the arrow that had wounded a True Immortal at its peak. It shattered with a thunderous explosion, dispersing into divine energy that enveloped him.

“Who will live, who will die? It’s not certain yet,” Luo Tian murmured lowly before leaping into the air.

“Disciplinary Hall disciples, where are you?” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed through the heavens.

Chapter 1986: Unleashing All Resources

“In here!” A deep roar echoed through the sky. Fifteen thousand warriors, their bodies stained with blood and riddled with wounds, bore an iron-forged resolve.

From ten thousand to fifteen thousand—after Luo Tian’s ruthless incursions into the Return to Origin Sect’s disciples, these fifteen thousand had endured bloodshed and now possessed unparalleled combat prowess.

“Disciples of the Ascendant Dragon Sect, where are you?” Luo Tian roared again. His voice trembled through the heavens, and the Ascendant Dragon Sect’s disciples responded in unison.

“In…!” Each disciple, whether engaged in battle or shouting, spoke with fervor. To them, Luo Tian was now a deity.

“Form the Great Divine Formation! Follow me and slay the True Immortal!” Luo Tian barked, his body soaring into the sky like a meteor.

“Yessir!” A cascade of figures ascended, their forms streaking like comets. Towering giants formed rapidly, emerging into view.

“Leave the rest to you; we’ll assist the elders!” Luo Tian addressed Zuo Qiuming and others.

“Beware!” Zuo Qiuming’s group replied. The battle at the Heaven-Realm had long since lost its suspense; victory was inevitable with enough time.

Yet, the True Immortal battlefield saw Ascendant Dragon Sect’s disadvantage growing.

The towering giant ascended into the heavens, colliding without hesitation with a True Immortal at its peak—this was the one who had slain Master Song.

“Boom…!” The colossal giant overturned the sky, crashing into the elder like a mountain.

Though only twenty thousand remained and they were exhausted, the giant still possessed the might of a True Immortal at its peak. Against this weary opponent, it was an annihilation.

The elder had wounded Master Song but bore his own wounds. Before he could react, a crushing pressure enveloped him, and he was instantly crushed into mist of blood.

“Damn it!” The Return to Origin Sect’s warriors grimaced, watching the giant charge into battle.

“Fight till the end!” The True Immortal peak elder’s face twisted with madness; only by fighting to the death could he hope for survival.

“Wum…” A pressure wave surged as the elder extended his hand, summoning a small green tower.

“Go…” He waved his hand, and the tower expanded instantly, descending upon Zang Yunfei and Sima Xiu.

“A superior-grade immortal artifact! They’ve finally unleashed it!” The masters of the Central Three Heavens gazed at the green tower, their expressions alight with anticipation.

Zang Yunfei and Sima Xiu grimaced, their faces pale as the tower descended upon them. Their prior clash with the True Immortal peak elder had left them battered, and their survival was a miracle.

“A superior-grade immortal artifact! The Ascendant Dragon Sect also has one!” They roared in unison, exchanging glances before Sima Xiu waved his hand. A tower of gray light materialized in his grasp.

“Huff…” As the tower appeared, countless souls poured forth from it.

“Rural clods! How could you match our Return to Origin Sect’s artifacts?” Two True Immortal late-period warriors, surrounded and attacked, sneered. They each summoned a copper lock and a dragon, both radiating the aura of superior-grade immortal artifacts.

“Another three superior-grade artifacts! With the previous Return to Origin Blade, that’s four!” The crowd gasped. Their eyes turned toward the three artifacts hovering above the Return to Origin Sect’s trio.

But it was not over yet. When Chen Tianyuan had perished, the wailing middle-aged man also surged with power, clutching a long sword.

“Five superior-grade immortal artifacts! How will the Ascendant Dragon Sect withstand this?” The True Immortal peak elder’s gaze darkened, scanning the Ascendant Dragon Sect.

“Also, our Return to Origin Sect’s greatest secret—Mountain-Sea Tree!” The elder bellowed, waving his hand.

“Disciples of the Return to Origin Sect! Offer your blood and refine the Mountain-Sea Tree!” He roared, releasing a radiant aura that bathed all in its light.

“Roar…” The Return to Origin Sect’s disciples howled, each spitting a drop of their essence toward the aura.

“Mountain-Sea Tree’s seed!” The masters of the Central Three Heavens gaped in awe.

“Father, what is the Mountain-Sea Tree?” Ye Liangchen asked, his face puzzled.

“The Mountain-Sea Tree originates from the World Tree. It is said to be the greatest miracle of the Immortal Realm, elusive and mysterious. Some claim it sustains the entire Immortal Realm; others say the Immortal Realm is but a part of the World Tree.”

“The World Tree birthed all things—immortal herbs, origin beasts, and more,” he continued.

“This Mountain-Sea Tree is a fruit of the World Tree, transformed into a seed to form the Mountain-Sea Seed. I never thought the Return to Origin Sect still possessed such a relic!”

“Though not as powerful as the World Tree, it is still unparalleled. It wields the might of mountains and seas!” Ye Wudao spoke softly, his voice laced with awe. This seed could incite greed even in Immortal Kings.

“Wum…” Blood dripped into the aura, and with a hum, the seed sprouted, growing rapidly under the essence of tens of thousands of Return to Origin Sect disciples.

“Boom…!” Its roots plunged into the earth, and a thousand-zhang-tall tree stood before them, connecting to heaven and earth. An overwhelming aura radiated from it.

Two emerald eyes opened slowly, their gaze cold and authoritative, as if viewing them all as insects.

“I have awakened you! Please destroy my enemies!” The True Immortal peak elder spoke, his voice respectful. This Mountain-Sea Tree was the Return to Origin Sect’s greatest secret—still in its juvenile form, yet capable of half-step Immortal King strength.

The elder would not have used it unless desperate; a sect’s true depth was never revealed until the end.

Though the Mountain-Sea Tree rivaled a half-step Immortal King, its pressure was immense, as if an entire world crushed down upon them. The Ascendant Dragon Sect’s disciples felt their chests tighten.

“Sky-Drake Sword!” Zang Yunfei barked, no longer concealing their strength.

His sword radiated sharpness, its aura of a superior-grade immortal artifact spreading.

“Earth-Drake Armor!” Peng Tiande pressed his hands into the air, and a resounding boom echoed. A formidable armor enveloped him.

“We Ascendant Dragon Sect also have our depth!” The three men moved their hands, and six streaks of light shot forth from their palms, forming a strange sigil.

The sigil etched itself into the blood-soaked sky, and the heavens shattered. A black hand emerged from the void.

The moment it appeared, space trembled, and a colossal entity materialized before them. Its cold aura sent shivers down their spines.

“Demon beast!” The three masters gasped, staring at the black entity. It was no smaller than Luo Tian’s divine formation.

“This is a half-step Immortal King demon king cultivated by the Ascendant Dragon Sect!” Zang Yunfei spoke coldly.

Long ago, the Sky-Drake Sect had attempted to breed a demon king, giving rise to the Sky-Drake Tomb. But it had never succeeded. Luo Tian’s captured demon king was a result of their experiments, though the Blade of Killing Demons had been taken by Gu Qianxue. Thus, they could not subdue demon beasts and were forced to abandon their efforts.

In truth, beneath the Sky-Drake Tomb lay something far more terrifying—the soul of a sect founder. The first great sage of the Sky-Drake Sect.

When he neared his demise, he used a special method to preserve his soul within the Sky-Drake Tomb. Over time, his soul had not entered reincarnation but transformed into a demon beast. This was the first sage’s method—transforming his soul into a demon king.

Yet, the Sky-Drake Sect dared not use it, allowing the first sage’s demon king to grow gradually. His consciousness had been entirely erased after becoming a demon beast.

But with the three sects united, the Earth-Drake Sect had researched souls. After joint research by three elders, they finally stimulated the first sage’s consciousness through the Soul-Nourishing Art.

“Roar…” The first sage roared, his massive body wreathed in black mist, charging directly at the Mountain-Sea Tree.

“A half-step Immortal King demon king versus the Mountain-Sea Tree—this battle is now evenly matched. Let’s see who prevails! But the Return to Origin Sect still has a True Immortal peak elder. If he unleashes a superior-grade artifact, it would be beyond the reach of three True Immortal late-period masters!” Ye Wudao spoke.

“If the Great Divine Formation had been at full strength, perhaps it could have fought. But now there’s no chance!”

“Two True Immortal late-period masters clearly suffered heavy wounds. Thus, this battle in the Lower Three Heavens will end in defeat!” The crowd sighed.

In essence, these sects looked down on the Lower Three Heavens. Yet they could not deny this battle was the most thrilling among all previous contests. Many even felt pity for the Ascendant Dragon Sect.

“Boom… boom…” As they marveled, the first sage’s demon king clashed with the Mountain-Sea Tree.

Black bodies collided against emerald leaves, thunderous roars echoing as branches lashed the demon king. Wind tore through space.

Chapter 1987: The Ascendant Dragon Sect’s Crisis

On the vast peak of the Ascendant Dragon Sect, the sky was empty save for the elderly and children. These few had little combat power.

If the Ascendant Dragon Sect won the contest, they would bring these people to the Central Three Heavens. If defeated, they would remain in the Lower Three Heavens to preserve a spark of their sect—like the ancient Zhenxian Sect. But their strength would be worlds apart from before.

At this moment, the elderly and children prayed fervently, hoping their husbands and sons would return safely.

“Wum…” But blood-red figures emerged from the sky, their faces cold.

They surrounded the Ascendant Dragon Sect, gazing at its grandeur with admiration. The leader was Mo Xunyun, the head of the Lower Three Heavens’ Blood Dragon Sect.

“Such a fine Ascendant Dragon Sect… yet today it shall be destroyed!” Mo Xunyun’s face bore a bloodthirsty expression as he gazed at the elderly and children.

“Kill!” Mo Xunyun waved his hand, and the blood-red figures surged forward toward the Ascendant Dragon Sect.

“Hah! You think participating in this contest would let you return alive?” Mo Xunyun sneered, allowing his disciples to attack.

“Kill…” Countless blood-red figures rushed toward the elderly and children.

“Plop… plop…” A chorus of cleavers sliced through them. These elderly and children were no match for the Blood Dragon Sect’s ruthless warriors, who slaughtered them like livestock.

A harrowing scream echoed through the Ascendant Dragon Sect’s sky. Xue Yushan’s face bled, but she remained composed. Knowing she could not defeat Mo Xunyun, she grabbed a newborn child and fled toward the Huantian Sea.

“Where do you think you’re going?” Mo Xunyun licked his lips, raising his blade to chase her.

In an instant, the entire Ascendant Dragon Sect became a hellish battlefield. Not a single soul remained alive; the blood-clad Blood Dragon Sect warriors ascended, vanishing from the peak.

“Luo Tian! I never expected you to outmaneuver me!” In the Blood Dragon Sect’s grand hall, Guan Hongsheng’s face bore coldness. He held a contest token, his expression twisted with a sinister grin.

The hall contained several elders, their faces trembling as they gazed at Guan Hongsheng.

These were leaders of sects in the Lower Three Heavens, once vying for contest tokens and equal to Guan Hongsheng. Now they looked like servants, their eyes filled with fear despite sitting.

“Master, truly a genius! You’ve manipulated the Ascendant Dragon Sect at your will. Following you, we shall surely rise and find a place in the Central Three Heavens!” One elder spoke.

“What about the Upper Three Heavens, Master?” As the elder spoke, others joined in, their flattery unceasing.

Though they were disgruntled, their lives now rested in his hands. They had no other path. Moreover, they recalled Guan Hongsheng’s terrifying power—his own True Immortal mid-period elder could not match him.

“Master!” As they conversed, Mo Xunyun entered the hall with a pale face. His eyes trembled as he fell to his knees.

“Master, I am incompetent! Two escaped—this woman suddenly unleashed True Immortal early-stage power. And a purple eagle, its speed was incredible. I was careless and let them escape. Forgive me!” Mo Xunyun trembled, his body shaking as he knelt before Guan Hongsheng.

“Fool!” Guan Hongsheng’s face darkened, his eyes flashing annoyance. He extended his hand, and an invisible wave surged from it.

“Wum…” Blood mist spilled from Mo Xunyun’s body, causing his face to change.

“Master, forgive me! Let me atone for my sins!” Feeling his cultivation fading, Mo Xunyun’s face was drenched in sweat. He bowed repeatedly, the hall trembling with each impact.

“I revoke your ten years of cultivation. If you fail again, I shall erase you!” Guan Hongsheng spoke coldly, swallowing the blood mist into his mouth.

“Yes! Yes! Yes!” Mo Xunyun nodded hurriedly, as if freed from a curse. He wiped his forehead.

“Enough. It should be done. Prepare for the campaign. Don’t be late; if you are, we’ll have to wait a hundred years for the contest!” Guan Hongsheng rose slowly, his gaze cold.

…

Meanwhile, the Ascendant Dragon Sect’s disciples were unaware their base had been wiped out a month ago. They continued fighting, oblivious to how many days had passed.

“Almost a month! The battle between the two sects should be ending soon!” Masters of the Central Three Heavens sighed, gazing at the battlefield littered with corpses. Many had perished from exhaustion.

“Too brutal! I’ve never seen such a fierce battle!” Genius disciples trembled, witnessing a dying man bite through his opponent’s neck, both perishing.

Thunderous roars echoed as the first sage’s demon king clashed with the Mountain-Sea Tree.

“Kill!” The Return to Origin Sect’s peak elder, his face cruel, stood beneath the green tower and charged toward Zang Yunfei and Sima Xiu.

Meanwhile, Peng Tiande in his armor fought a True Immortal late-period opponent wielding a superior-grade artifact.

Xuan Dan, Xue Changshan, Li Changfeng and others—newcomers to True Immortal mid-period—surrounded a True Immortal late-period.

Though they had once been evenly matched, the moment this opponent unleashed a superior-grade artifact, the tide turned. Golden swords danced, each swing leaving Xuan Dan and others unable to withstand it, suffering greatly.

“Two elders! Go assist them! This old man is ours!” Luo Tian addressed Zang Yunfei and Sima Xiu, seeing Xuan Dan and Zuo Qiuming in peril.

“What?” Their faces shifted slightly at Luo Tian’s words.

“Hurry! Don’t worry!” Luo Tian spoke through the giant, urging them forward. He then drove his massive form toward the True Immortal peak elder charging at them.

“Is he mad? Using a formation capable of True Immortal mid-period to fight a True Immortal peak elder!” All minds echoed this thought.

“Barbarian God’s Battle Chant!” Luo Tian barked, his voice a complex melody. Ancient and沧桑 (sorrowful), it swept over the twenty thousand surrounding him.

“Roar…” Next, a surge of power erupted from all disciples, their voices roaring.

“The Great Divine Formation has reached True Immortal late-period!” The crowd gasped, even the Ascendant Dragon Sect disciples were stunned. As the melody resonated, their potential erupted completely.

“That’s our tribe’s barbarian script!” Man Hun’s face bore disbelief, gazing at the colossal giant.

Before long, the True Immortal peak elder with the green tower approached Luo Tian. The overwhelming pressure made his face grim.

“Crush!” Luo Tian waved his hand, a black fish leaping from it. It hummed and transformed into a shadowy fish covering his head.

“Damn it, Luo Tian… if you keep doing this, I’ll devour you! Do you even know what you’re doing?” The shadowy fish roared, echoing through the battlefield. Observers’ mouths twitched.

“An artifact spirit! And one with sentience!”

“Is it a top-tier immortal artifact?” The crowd murmured, considering the possibility. Yet sensing the shadowy fish’s aura, they relaxed slightly but gazed more hungrily.

“Those three artifacts—gun, bow, and this shadowy fish—are all approaching top-tier immortal artifacts. Especially the shadowy fish, which has developed such sentience!”

“Luo Tian alone produced these three. Along with the three superior-grade artifacts from the two True Immortal late-period masters, that’s six! Exceeding the Return to Origin Sect!” The crowd murmured.

“A sect from the Lower Three Heavens has more superior-grade artifacts than the Return to Origin Sect!”

“No, those three approaching top-tier are his own!” They deduced, their eyes turning to Luo Tian in disbelief.

One person with three superior-grade artifacts—equivalent to a sect—and all surpassing superior-grade, nearing top-tier. That was a treasure trove!

Their eyes gleamed with desire as they gazed at the giant with the shadowy fish above. The clash between this giant and the True Immortal peak elder with the green tower was imminent.

“Boom…” The giant trembled violently, and many Ascendant Dragon Sect disciples spat blood, their faces pale.

Meanwhile, the True Immortal peak elder fared no better; his body was thrown back, swaying unsteadily. The green tower was shattered by the shadowy fish.

“Hah! A mere superior-grade artifact, how dare you fight me? Luo Tian, next time find me!” The shadowy fish sneered, leaving the crowd speechless.

“Not a match at all!” Luo Tian stood within the formation, watching his disciples spitting blood. He muttered to himself.

Chapter 1988: I Surrender

Though the shadowy fish could withstand it, Luo Tian and his disciples couldn’t endure the collision.

“Crush!” As Luo Tian mused, the True Immortal peak elder returned the tower and unleashed it toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Get out of my way!” The shadowy fish roared, its dark light shielding Luo Tian’s group. His voice carried confidence.

“Crack…” The green tower pressed against the barrier, shattering again. Yet Luo Tian’s group was also battered by the collision, their faces pale.

“Though you have this shadowy fish to protect you, can you withstand it?” The True Immortal peak elder smiled, gazing at Luo Tian’s group, pale-faced.

“Crush again!” The elder roared, and the green tower descended once more toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Not enough! I must use my final move!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed madness, and the Bow of Shooting the Sun expanded, landing in the giant’s hand. Simultaneously, the Crack-Heaven Spear transformed into a spear-shape in his other hand.

“Is he using that superior-grade artifact as an arrow?” The crowd deduced, their breaths quickening.

“What power could two artifacts approaching top-tier unleash?” All were curious, their eyes filled with anticipation.

Drawing the bow, nocking the arrow!

The golden Crack-Heaven Spear gleamed with cold light. An invisible aura spread across the Great Divine Formation, causing the True Immortal peak elder to pause.

“Wum…” Golden light flashed, splitting the sky. In an instant, the Crack-Heaven Spear vanished from sight. No one could follow its speed, not even Ye Wudao and other sect masters.

“Crack…” The sound of breaking made them realize, their eyes wide with shock as they gazed at the True Immortal peak elder.

The golden spear had vanished, forming a long spear. More terrifying was the green fragments falling from the sky. The spear had pierced the True Immortal peak elder’s shoulder, his eyes filled with terror.

“Those green towers were shattered by a single arrow!” All gasped, gazing at Luo Tian.

At this moment, the Great Divine Formation trembled, as if it could collapse at any time. Disciples of the Ascendant Dragon Sect, pale-faced and weak, maintained the formation with trembling bodies. Yet their eyes glowed with excitement.

“Combined, they surpassed superior-grade artifacts! Definitely surpassing them! Otherwise, how could it shatter that green tower? Only a top-tier artifact could achieve this!”

“This contest, besides the Mountain-Sea Tree and that demon king, the Return to Origin Sect’s elder isn’t the strongest. Luo Tian is! One bow and one arrow, equivalent to a top-tier artifact. That arrow could not be dodged!” Ye Wudao spoke, his voice laced with fear.

Other sect masters’ gazes toward Luo Tian changed completely. If it were just Luo Tian, it would be manageable. But if he formed the Great Divine Formation and unleashed the Bow of Shooting the Sun and Crack-Heaven Spear, he could annihilate them all.

“Lord Luo’s might!”

“Hah! Our Ascendant Dragon Sect shall surely ascend to the Central Three Heavens today!” The disciples, seeing this scene, erupted with excitement.

“If it weren’t for the green tower, I would be dead!” The True Immortal peak elder trembled. That moment had nearly cost him his life.

“Return!” As they marveled, Luo Tian spoke weakly, and the Crack-Heaven Spear returned to his hand.

“Three times—only three!” Luo Tian calculated, estimating how many times he could summon the Bow of Shooting the Sun to fire the Crack-Heaven Spear. This consumption was terrifying, beyond most people’s endurance.

“Wum…” Without hesitation, Luo Tian drew the Bow of Shooting the Sun again, aiming the Crack-Heaven Spear at the Return to Origin Sect’s peak elder.

“Elders, I demand your favor!” As the spear aimed at the True Immortal peak elder, his face changed. He shouted to the crowd of Central Three Heavens.

“Crack…” Before he finished, Luo Tian moved, releasing the spear.

“Boom…” Blood erupted, and the elder’s body became a blooming flower of blood in the sky. His blood fell into the Huantian Sea.

“A True Immortal elder of the Return to Origin Sect, slain! And only two arrows!” The crowd gasped.

They had imagined various deaths for this True Immortal peak elder—slain by the Ascendant Dragon Sect’s depth, or killed collectively. Yet none had expected him to be shattered by a formation of True Immortal peak strength, with two arrows.

“Elders are dead!” All trembled, their eyes filled with fear as they gazed at the Great Divine Formation. Their despair was complete.

“Last arrow, for you!” Luo Tian roared, slowly lifting both arms. The Crack-Heaven Spear and Bow of Shooting the Sun were raised again, this time aimed at the Mountain-Sea Tree.

“Crack… crack…” The Mountain-Sea Tree felt danger, its trunk swaying as it prepared to defend.

“Boom…” The demon king ignored this and slammed into the Mountain-Sea Tree with a dull thud.

This time, the giant’s bowstring draw slowed as if drained of strength. Yet its aura remained overwhelming.

Meanwhile, the shadowy fish flew up toward the Mountain-Sea Tree. If it destroyed this tree, the battle would end completely. With Zang Yunfei’s group and three superior-grade artifacts, they already held an absolute advantage.

“Don’t… don’t fight! I surrender! I’m still a child!” As Luo Tian prepared to fire, the Mountain-Sea Tree’s mouth shouted. Its voice carried a childish tone.

“…”

“Everyone has their struggles. Let’s stop fighting!” The Mountain-Sea Tree spoke loudly, leaving everyone speechless.

“Ah…” Luo Tian was startled. He had expected the Mountain-Sea Tree to possess consciousness and speak, but he hadn’t anticipated it being so timid.

Where was the previous arrogance? Where was that gaze of looking down on all as insects? You are a seed of the World Tree, born from it. This is too shameful—accurately, too shameful for a tree!

“Don’t look at me like that. I am tall and mighty, the most handsome tree in the world! I truly surrender! Believe me!” The World Tree gazed at them, stunned.

Even the opposing sects halted their attacks, staring in disbelief at the swaying tree.

“This is our Return to Origin Sect’s depth?” All disciples were utterly despairing, their faith shattered.

“Can I surrender now? I truly mean it! From now on, I won’t fight. Just consider me a tree!” The Mountain-Sea Tree spoke again, its voice resolute.

“This thing is like Longque Elder—born from the World Tree? How bizarre!” Luo Tian’s mouth twitched, gazing at the tree standing like a stump. He sighed inwardly.

Yet he still held the Crack-Heaven Spear aimed at the Mountain-Sea Tree, not moving. The demon king also watched it cautiously, not relaxing.

“Still don’t believe me? Fine! I’ll transform into a seed and surrender!” Seeing Luo Tian and the demon king still there, the Mountain-Sea Tree spoke again. In disbelief, its trunk slowly shrank until it transformed into a seed.

“Huff…” Luo Tian gazed at the seed hovering there, exhaling deeply. The Ascendant Dragon Sect’s disciples also sighed in relief. The colossal giant collapsed, and twenty thousand disciples surrounded Luo Tian, though their faces were pale and they stood with difficulty.

“Kill them!” But the Ascendant Dragon Sect’s others roared, charging toward the despairing Return to Origin Sect disciples.

“Surrenderers are not killed!” Luo Tian soared into the sky, knowing that taking them in would cause trouble. Yet with their victory and heavy losses, it was better to strengthen the Ascendant Dragon Sect.

“Luo Tian! You killed my grandson Chang Ziyang, do you think I don’t know?”

“You also killed my grandson Huang Youshan!” As the Return to Origin Sect’s group collapsed, five voices echoed. Five figures stood in the sky, gazing at Luo Tian.

“What?” The crowd murmured, their eyes turning to Luo Tian. These five were known—elders of sects in the Central Three Heavens, who had caused a stir before.

Though their cultivation was True Immortal late-period, they were backed by powerful sects. No one dared underestimate them.

“Luo Tian is the one who killed Huang Youshan and others?” The crowd deduced, their expressions changing. Even Ye Wudao’s face bore disbelief.

“Brave indeed! After so long, finally found you! I never thought it would be Luo Tian. He must have been in the Lower Three Heavens then!” The crowd whispered, some gazing at Luo Tian with admiration. Few in the Central Three Heavens dared act like him.

“What do you want?” Luo Tian panted, gazing at the five. His voice was cold, and he still held the Crack-Heaven Spear and Bow of Shooting the Sun.

“Self-mutilate, renounce your cultivation, kneel before us and follow! Otherwise, even if you survive today, the Central Three Heavens will never let your Ascendant Dragon Sect stay!” The five elders spoke coldly, but as they gazed at Luo Tian’s weapons, they took a step back.

Chapter 1989: Success?

“You dare!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness, gazing at them. The Bow of Shooting the Sun remained in his hand.

“You five want to do what? This is a contest! You’ll break the rules!” Ye Wudao sneered, stepping forward.

“Ye Wudao!” The five elders’ faces shifted slightly. They hadn’t expected Ye Wudao to intervene.

“Ye Wudao, this is a personal grudge between us and him. We don’t wish to interfere with the contest!” Huang Youshan’s grandfather, Huang Tiande, spoke loudly. Yet all could sense his fear of Ye Wudao and his试探 (testing) their relationship with Luo Tian.

“He is my son’s friend. Who dares touch him, my son won’t allow it. My son will handle it, so I must too. If I do, the Star River Prefecture shall also intervene!” Ye Wudao smiled, shaking his head. Yet his voice carried dominance.

“Ye Wudao, don’t think we fear your sect! If a fight breaks out, your Star River Prefecture will also suffer heavy losses!” The elder in purple robes spoke.

“Ah, yes! Your Purple Sun Sect is strong. But if I bring people to destroy you, do you think your Purple Sun Sect would dare fight me over this?” Ye Wudao sneered, giving no face to the elder.

“I say now: whoever touches him, Star River Prefecture shall intervene!”

“Moreover, this is a contest. Other sects must not interfere. This is the rule set by the Nine Immortal Mountains. Will you break it? We Star River Prefecture shall not allow it!” Ye Wudao spoke loudly, aligning himself with the Nine Immortal Mountains.

Hearing this, Nan Gong Yuqing and others felt a flush of shame. Earlier, Ye Wudao had intended to protect Luo Tian with Star River Prefecture. Now he had shifted to defending the Nine Immortal Mountains.

“Indeed, a father and son!” Ren Hongzhe mused, glancing at Ye Liangchen beside him.

“Luo Tian is my brother! Who dares touch him, I’ll fight them to the death!” Ye Liangchen stepped forward after his father spoke, his face arrogant.

“Good! Good! Good!” The five elders fumed, their beards shaking. Yet they dared not touch Ye Wudao. Star River Prefecture was powerful; no one dared defy the top two sects. Moreover, everyone knew Star River Prefecture was mad—Ye Wudao, Ye Tian, and Ye Sheng were all madmen.
