“Boom……” Elder Lu’s body collapsed onto the ground, his eyes filled with terror as blood continuously flowed from his form.

“Woo……” Luo Tian finally returned the Dragon Abyss sword to his back, retrieved the Sun-Seeking Bow and God-Killing Arrow, and slowly drew the bowstring.

“There are still tricks left!”

“Superior divine artifact!” Seeing the Sun-Seeking Bow and God-Killing Arrow, a chorus of gasps erupted among the crowd, their faces etched with shock.

“Creak……” Luo Tian’s arms bulged with veins as the bowstring trembled. When he had drawn it halfway, Luo Tian released the God-Killing Arrow.

“Burst……” A dark light flashed; the God-Killing Arrow transformed into a deathly beam, streaking toward Elder Lu.

Elder Lu’s eyes reflected despair. At this moment, his injuries were severe, leaving him powerless to block the arrow. He could only watch helplessly as it approached, his gaze turning to the three True Immortal Peak elders, pleading in his eyes.

The three True Immortal Peak elders finally moved. One elder leapt into the air, instantly appearing before Elder Lu and seizing the God-Killing Arrow.

“Superior divine artifact’s arrow?” The elder’s face bore admiration, viewing Luo Tian as a living treasure.

“Old man, I’ve grown fond of you—I wish to snatch it from you!” The elder spoke, his words causing a ripple of murmurs among the crowd.

“Shameless old man…” The disciples of the Rotating Palace sighed inwardly, even feeling a flicker of sympathy for Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s body trembled slightly as he gazed at the elder, who had not loosened his grip. A cold smile flickered in Luo Tian’s heart.

“It seems killing a True Immortal Late Period was not enough to震慑!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, then withdrew the Dragon Abyss sword again.

“Is he going to resist?” The disciples of the Rotating Palace’s faces turned shocked at Luo Tian’s action.

To confront a True Immortal Peak with merely a True Immortal Mid-Period was unprecedented in history. The only exceptions were the Ten Judges of Hell, the Ten Palace Masters!

But who were the Ten Judges of Hell? The Rotating Palace’s depth was unfathomable, a far cry from what the Luo family could match.

“Boy, you are strong, but our gap is too vast!” The elder spoke softly, taking a step toward Luo Tian. With a wave of his hand, he flung the God-Killing Arrow away.

Light flashed again, appearing before Luo Tian. He raised the Dragon Abyss sword in defense, and fire flared once more before him.

As sparks flew, Luo Tian was hurled backward, blood gushing from his mouth like water.

“The gap is too great—you are no match for me!” The elder spoke, his voice laced with amusement.

“Old dog, don’t push me! I came all the way here to the Rotating Palace; your ambush is forgivable, but now you’re bullying me? If the Rotating Palace acts this way, I’ll refuse to enter!” Luo Tian’s eyes burned with madness. Due to the previous demonic aura invasion, his mind had been slightly impaired.

Chapter 2123: Directly()

The elder’s immense pressure radiated outward, each step causing Luo Tian’s heart to constrict. This was his first true confrontation with a True Immortal Peak; to claim he wasn’t nervous was impossible.

“You are indeed promising, but your sharpness is too bold—unaware of the heavens and earth!” The elder spoke coldly, approaching Luo Tian twenty zhang away. With a single palm strike, he pressed down toward Luo Tian.

“Boom……” The heavens and earth trembled as a black hand, like a storm cloud, descended upon Luo Tian.

“Woo……” Seeing the descending hand, wind surged forth, and a torrent of demonic aura erupted from Luo Tian’s grip—more precisely, from the Dragon Abyss sword in his hand.

“Crash….” The swordsman’s aura surged, causing the Rotating Palace to quake. Each sword in the crowd began trembling violently.

“This….” Some disciples gazed at their quivering swords, faces filled with awe.

His hair flew wildly; Luo Tian’s eyes gradually darkened as he stared at the descending hand.

“Old dog, you forced me! Today I’ll make this place flow with blood!” Luo Tian roared, his fingers whitening from the strain.

The broad sword emerged into view; the Dragon Abyss had been drawn halfway, its overwhelming demonic aura already instilling fear.

The Rotating Palace’s ground was a grand hall, but its core lay underground. The deeper one went, the denser the ghostly qi became. At the very bottom of the Rotating Palace’s underground, it was said to be the eighteen layers of hell’s reincarnation.

At the moment Luo Tian had drawn the Dragon Abyss halfway, in the second-to-last underground chamber of the Rotating Palace, eight black courtyards housed eight elders who simultaneously opened their eyes, expressions filled with shock.

“Seven Deadly Swords! Dragon Abyss!” They all spoke at once, their voices laced with disbelief before vanishing into the courtyards.

“Old dog, can you bully my nephew?” Just as Luo Tian prepared to draw the Dragon Abyss and fight desperately, a furious voice echoed in everyone’s ears. A blade of black light surged forward first, slicing through the black hand before rushing toward the elder.

“Hmph?” The elder’s face shifted slightly, his arm suddenly covered in scales, transforming into a ghostly claw that reached for the black blade.

“Crack….” The black blade shattered before the elder, scattering his robes.

“Woo…” As the elder had just shattered one blade, a second followed swiftly. A figure appeared in view.

A flash of light—his head was bald, radiating brilliance. His face bore fury as he swung his long sword downward, striking the elder.

“Old dog, who do you think you are to touch!” Curses echoed endlessly as blades flashed, each strike falling without pause. The heavens and earth were filled with blade strikes.

Each strike forced the elder to retreat, his face pale, as if a storm of wind and rain left no chance for respite or resistance. His arms, transformed into ghostly claws, continuously shed scales.

“Crack….” Luo Tian retracted the Dragon Abyss halfway, his face alight with joy as he gazed at the bald man.

“Uncle Dao!” Luo Tian shouted, recognizing the bald figure.

“Chen Dao!” The crowd gradually recognized Chen Dao, their faces filled with disbelief as they gazed at the black-clad figure subduing the elder.

“How did he return? He was in Kanmen!” Their faces bore shock, staring at the mad Chen Dao.

“Chen Dao, what are you doing?” The elder spat blood, subdued by Chen Dao, shouting.

“Talking to you?” Chen Dao coldly replied before swinging his sword again.

Chen Dao was also exasperated. At that time, he had been scorched by magma, losing his hair and eyebrows. After Luo Tian recognized him, he left immediately, feeling embarrassed and seeking a place to regrow his hair before following Luo Tian again.

But after finding a secluded spot, he discovered his hair and eyebrows would not grow back—what should have been simple was impossible. Later, Chen Dao had no choice but to return to Tiansha City, only to learn Luo Tian had already fled with the magma dragon. He chased for twenty days before catching up, secretly following to ensure Luo Tian reached the Rotating Palace safely.

But who could have known those disciples would attempt to seize Luo Tian? Chen Dao had observed, watching Luo Tian kill fiercely, even slaying a True Immortal Late Period. Chen Dao had intended to leave but could not have anticipated this shameless elder.

Chen Dao knew he must intervene; otherwise, Luo Tian would be in danger. Once out, many would see his bald head, inevitably causing mockery.

And all this was due to the shameless elder—how could Chen Dao not be furious, channeling his wrath into this man who had made him look foolish?

“Why is Chen Dao bald, even lacking eyebrows?”

“He doesn’t resemble the rumors at all!” Especially hearing the crowd’s murmurs and seeing their smirks, Chen Dao grew even angrier. Each strike sent the elder coughing blood.

“Madman…” The remaining two True Immortal Peak elders watched Chen Dao’s relentless attacks, their eyes twitching.

Though both were True Immortal Peaks, there was still a gap in strength. For instance, Chen Dao had fought countless battles in Kanmen and would certainly surpass them.

“Chen Dao, don’t push me!” The elder howled, his seven orifices gushing blood before he roared.

“Push you? If I don’t deal with you, you won’t know your place! You dare to bully a junior!” Chen Dao sneered, continuing his strikes.

“That’s what I said earlier…” The elder was exasperated, finally forced to the Rotating Palace’s entrance, colliding violently with the grand hall’s door.

“Today I’ll kill you—what can you do about it?” Chen Dao sneered, his eyes flashing murderous intent.

“Chen Dao truly intends to kill Elder Ma!” Seeing Chen Dao’s killing intent, the crowd erupted in chaos, finally understanding why the Rotating Palace called him a madman.

“This should be enough to震慑!” Luo Tian sighed, returning the Dragon Abyss to his back.

“Boy, you did well—this time you escaped!” A carefree voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind—the stone’s voice.

“Damn it… where were you earlier? I’m your master, yet you didn’t help me!” Luo Tian was startled by the stone.

“Boy, do you know you exposed yourself? Didn’t you know Dragon Abyss is one of the Seven Deadly Swords? It definitely drew attention. You didn’t realize that?” The stone’s voice made Luo Tian shiver slightly.

“Chen Dao, I give up! Let me compensate you with your nephew’s treasures!” Elder Ma, wounded and bloodied, finally begged for mercy.

“Boom…” His body collapsed onto the ground, gazing at Chen Dao who stood panting.

“Say I’ll kill you—compensation is useless!” Chen Dao sneered, gripping his black sword high above before slashing downward.

“Woo…” As the black blade descended, pressure enveloped them. Eight figures appeared in the sky, the scene freezing momentarily. A black-cloaked elder extended a hand, seizing Chen Dao’s sword.

“Little blade, don’t kill! Just teach him a lesson!” The elder spoke, his voice like thunder, restoring the frozen scene. The terrifying pressure vanished.

Luo Tian was also stunned, gazing at the eight elders in the sky, his eyes filled with disbelief.

Eight elders—four at the Immortal King Early Period, four at the Mid-Period—a terrifying force, undoubtedly the most fearsome Luo Tian had ever encountered.

“Come with us, boy,” one elder extended a hand, lifting Luo Tian as the eight vanished from view.

Space twisted; in an instant, Luo Tian stood in a black courtyard, the eight elders watching him.

“Leave Dragon Abyss here! This is beyond your control!” One elder spoke sternly, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Are you the one Tianming mentioned?” Another elder spoke, his voice laced with amusement.

“Respectfully, I am Luo’s direct descendant, Luo Chen!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully, sensing this elder might be connected to Du Tianming—perhaps his savior.

“Hmph, good. You are indeed promising. How did you obtain Dragon Abyss?” The elder’s face bore satisfaction as he inquired.

“In Tiansha City, there is a ruin named Dragon Abyss…” Luo Tian spoke, recounting his acquisition of the Dragon Abyss truthfully, concealing details like the stone.

“Truly fortunate!” The Immortal King elders marveled at Luo Tian’s tale.

“Leave Dragon Abyss here—it will be a curse for you!” Another elder spoke, as the Dragon Abyss was an ultimate treasure, destined to be the Rotating Palace’s sacred artifact.

“Elder, I would gladly leave Dragon Abyss here, but it has chosen me. Unless I die, it will not return to being unclaimed. Deadly swords have souls—surely you elders know this!” Luo Tian’s heart raced, but he spoke calmly.

“Don’t think I’m a soft target—go take the Rosary Sword from the Reincarnation Palace and the Absolute Cloud Sword from Fengdu!” Luo Tian’s anger surged, especially at the two elders who immediately demanded his sword. It was an insult, as if speaking to him was already a favor.

Chapter 2124: The Poison Sword Immortal ()

The black hall stood imposingly, a crowd filled with awe as they gazed at the bloodstained ground. Their bodies involuntarily shivered—none had expected a newly joined disciple to be so terrifying, killing so many and even summoning the Rotating Palace’s Immortal King elders.

As the eight vanished, people gradually regained freedom. A name was etched into their minds: Luo Chen of the Beast Ghost King City, House Luo.

“Old Ma, this time you’re lucky—Sword Immortal’s favor I grant. If there’s another time, I’ll have our commander personally speak to you!”

“We bled in Kanmen; you oppress our juniors here. If the commander himself comes, the result would be different!” Chen Dao spoke coldly, gazing at the elder he nearly killed and other True Immortal Peak elders.

“Not at all… not at all…” Hearing Chen Dao’s words, both the three elders who had emerged and those who followed quickly shook their heads.

“Remember my words!” Chen Dao sneered, then took flight with his bald head, vanishing from view.

“Who is this Luo Chen? Why did Chen Dao personally escort him?” Once Chen Dao left, the crowd murmured, discussing Luo Tian’s identity.

The Rotating Palace was one of the ten top forces in Hell. To investigate a Luo family member was effortless.

“Son of Luo Shui, who once served in Kanmen with Du Tianming and even saved his life!” As people investigated, they learned Luo Tian’s identity—why Chen Dao had personally escorted him.

Du Tianming, commander of the Ghost Gate’s Kanmen’s Mad Ghost Army, was backed by the entire Hell Kanmen. Faceless Ghosts gave Du Tianming respect.

Moreover, Du Tianming had another identity—assistant palace master of the Rotating Palace, Poison Sword Immortal Du Jianxing!

The Rotating Palace’s palace master resided in the final layer, rarely intervening unless major events occurred. Thus, the eight assistant palace masters were the true powerholders. Above Immortal Kings stood Immortals—though status-wise, Immortals were slightly higher than Beast Ghost King, their strength was unmatched.

“Return,” one True Immortal Peak elder spoke. “Let this matter rest; no one should mention it again. When he returns from the elders, whoever arranges for him to be a normal disciple!”

“Yes!” The crowd bowed respectfully, beginning to tidy the disarrayed mountain gate. Elder Ma’s eyes bore resentment, gazing at Chen Dao’s distant figure.

Yet Elder Ma, though resentful, lacked the strength to oppose Du Tianming.

In another black hall, Luo Tian stood there, gazing at the eight elders, feeling unprecedented pressure.

“Do you think we can’t handle you?” The elder at the Immortal King Early Period rebuked, his pressure overwhelming Luo Tian, causing him to sweat.

The Immortal King’s pressure was too strong—Luo Tian felt as if he couldn’t breathe.

“Respectfully, I dare not! I merely spoke the truth. Even if I die, obtaining Dragon Abyss will be difficult for you!” Luo Tian spoke, now forced to bow.

Luo Tian began to grasp the Rotating Palace’s rules: with strength, one could do as they pleased. Anything was possible to seize!

“I want you to produce the sword, not argue!” The elder’s anger deepened as he intensified his pressure.

“Enough,” the elder who had smiled at Luo Tian spoke, voice resolute. “Let this boy stay with me for a few days. Dragon Abyss is an ultimate deadly sword—its bond requires patience!”

“Old Du, are you trying to hoard it? If so, we have no objections. The entire Rotating Palace is most suited to possess this Dragon Abyss!” One elder spoke, also an Immortal King Mid-Period.

“No!”

“I have no face to steal a junior’s treasure. I merely admire talent. This boy earned Dragon Abyss’ approval—his sword art must be promising. I wish to see if he can inherit my legacy!” The Du elder spoke, voice laced with amusement.

“Apprentice?” Hearing the elder’s words, the other seven elders’ faces shifted slightly. They hadn’t expected Du Tianming to take an apprentice.

“Since Old Du said so, let it be settled. However, this boy is clearly no easy target—keep a close watch,” one elder smiled, ceasing to demand Dragon Abyss.

The crowd fell silent, rising and exiting the hall. Only the Du elder remained seated, smiling at Luo Tian.

“Sit,” he said. “I’ll introduce myself—my name is Du Jianxing, an assistant palace master of the Rotating Palace. The elders you saw earlier are also assistant masters!”

“Don’t take their words too seriously. Tianming brought you in; I’ll naturally protect you. Of course, if your strength is insufficient, I won’t save you—let you fend for yourself!”

“Precisely, I save you because of your strength and talent!” Du Jianxing spoke, voice laced with amusement.

“As for taking an apprentice,” he continued, “it was a sudden decision. To become my disciple, you must test your悟性 (insight)!” Du Jianxing stood slowly, stepping out of the courtyard as Luo Tian bowed and followed.

“I don’t want to!” Luo Tian muttered inwardly, but it was just a thought—Du Jianxing at Immortal King Mid-Period was an existence capable of crushing him effortlessly.

Du Jianxing led Luo Tian through the black path, and only then did Luo Tian realize the thick ghostly qi surrounding them. It was so dense it even caused black mist to rise in places.

Du Jianxing said nothing, and Luo Tian dared not speak, merely following behind him, unsure of their destination.

A darkness with no courtyards—evidently Du Jianxing’s domain. After an hour, Du Jianxing led Luo Tian to a black mountain peak.

The black mountain exuded an imposing aura, resembling a towering sword. Luo Tian noticed the countless sword marks on its peak—those very marks imbued this mountain with overwhelming sword intent.

“Seven days,” Du Jianxing spoke, “if you grasp anything, I’ll take you as my disciple. If not, in the Rotating Palace, I’ll protect your life three times!”

“Crash….” A hundred swords flew from Du Jianxing’s hands, enveloping the two in a swirling aura. The area surrounded by swords seemed filled with sword energy, making Luo Tian’s face grim.

“This is the Sword Array I cultivated when becoming an Immortal King—this array will aid your understanding of these sword marks!” Du Jianxing spoke softly, then stepped out of the array, vanishing from Luo Tian’s sight.

“I…” Luo Tian wanted to speak but found Du Jianxing already gone.

“Sigh….” Luo Tian sighed deeply, knowing Dragon Abyss’ exposure would bring trouble—but he hadn’t anticipated such a massive one.

“You’ve struck gold! This blade’s edge is clearly the old man’s—his sword marks from when he trained. A mid-Immortal King’s mark, a treasure for a novice like you!”

“And this array—likely a small sword domain. It’s truly beneficial for understanding these marks! Seems the old man genuinely wants you as his disciple!” The stone’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

“What are you?” Luo Tian replied, eyes filled with confusion. This stone—Luo Tian still didn’t know where it was. Du Jianxing and the others hadn’t noticed its presence, proving its uniqueness.

“I’m not a thing…呸… I am a thing!”

“You’re the thing! Your whole family is things! My name will scare you to death!” The stone became flustered, eventually turning the blame toward Luo Tian.

“A speck of dust, a stone—why did I treat you as precious? Chased by that fire dragon for so long, I regret it! If not for you, I wouldn’t have gotten into this mess!” Luo Tian sat cross-legged, not rushing to understand but instead probing the stone.

“You bastard! You took the scabbard away—who told you to be greedy? I even picked it up! And why did you spray blood on me? If not for you, I’d be bathing and sleeping!”

“A grain of sand can fill the sea; a blade of grass can sever stars. Haven’t you heard? Daring to look down on me!” The stone retaliated.

“Blah blah, don’t say your name yet?” Luo Tian frowned, then ignored the stone.

“Come on, listen carefully! I am the invincible of all ages…”

“No interest. Don’t bother me—I need to understand sword energy!” Luo Tian cut off the stone’s boasting, gazing at the mountain peak.

“No way, I have to tell you who I am today! I am the invincible of all ages, the supreme stone of heaven!”

“Just now that old man—had I struck him, he’d be broken bones and shattered sinews! Believe me!” The stone boasted again.

“Remember the time, I was driven by my previous master to punch through the sky, creating this eighteen-layer hell! I fell and created reincarnation, allowing the immortal realm to rebirth!” The stone rambled on.

Chapter 2125: Sword Realm ()

“Heaven-Blocking Stone!” Though Luo Tian seemed indifferent, his face shifted slightly upon hearing the stone’s words. He thought of Mount Heaven-Blocking, both sharing “heaven-blocking” in their names. Instantly, he connected the two.

“Have you heard of Mount Heaven-Blocking?” Luo Tian asked, his voice laced with amusement.

“Mount Heaven-Blocking? Never heard of it. But what is that bird thing? Daring to share two characters with me! When I have time, I’ll destroy that Mount Heaven-Blocking!” The stone replied.

“Boy, this Rotating Palace isn’t ordinary. Do you want to pull off a big heist? Beneath the Rotating Palace lies good things!” The stone spoke again, making Luo Tian’s eyes narrow slightly. He was tempted but ultimately shook his head.

This stone’s words were half-believed—perhaps it truly held good things, but that place was definitely not simple. It was beyond his current capacity to handle. The stone could escape, but he couldn’t.

“Go on, bring me some good things. I won’t go!” Luo Tian smiled, then ignored the stone, gazing at the towering sword peak.

Luo Tian’s eyes darkened slightly, as if seeing a figure constantly swinging his sword, leaving marks on the mountain peak. Finally, he achieved supreme sword mastery.

“Is ‘Sword-Body Unity’ the first realm of a swordsman? I haven’t even reached the first!” Luo Tian spoke softly.

Luo Tian had possessed many great swords before—like the Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword, the Dragon-Soaring Sword, and now the Dragon Abyss.

He had also fought against sword cultivators countless times, vaguely understanding that sword art had its unique realms. Mastering it would surely boost his strength.

However, Luo Tian had focused on the Splitting Heaven Spear for years. If it were spear techniques, he would certainly be a master. But if it were sword art, he was merely capable of using it.

“Swords are kings among weapons. Among all weapons, swords rank first—kings dominate everything. Whether it’s disciples from the Nine Realms, immortal realm cultivators, or ghostly hell disciples, most use swords. It’s because they’re easy to handle and quick to master!”

“But kings are kings—though they dominate everything, mastering sword art is exceptionally difficult.”

“Everything in the world reaches its peak as a path. For example, elixir art or spear art. Spear art emphasizes relentless advance with no retreat—what does sword art emphasize?” Luo Tian murmured, his gaze deepening.

The Heaven-Blocking Stone remained silent, not disturbing Luo Tian’s meditation.

“But I’ve only seen ‘Sword-Body Unity.’ I’ve never seen the next realm. My task now is to master ‘Sword-Body Unity’ and enter this sword art’s入门 (entry). As for the future, I must find it myself!”

“I won’t abandon the Splitting Heaven Spear. Though mastering two paths is difficult!” Luo Tian’s eyes brightened, then became ethereal again.

“Woo…” In illusion, Luo Tian felt himself become the sword energy within the Illusion Sword Array. Though chaotic, it had rules.

At the same time, he continuously recalled the sword marks on the mountain peak, transforming into Du Jianxing’s image, constantly moving his Dragon Abyss.

“This boy truly has high insight!” Du Jianxing stood in his courtyard, eyes filled with admiration.

“Previously, he used swords recklessly. However, he had deep expertise in another weapon, which hindered his sword art insight!” Du Jianxing’s brows furrowed slightly, a contemplative look in his eyes.

Time passed slowly; seven days slipped by unnoticed. Luo Tian seemed to lose track of time, becoming sword energy drifting through the heavens and earth.

Du Jianxing silently appeared beside the Illusion Sword Array, a smile on his face as he gazed at Luo Tian seated in meditation.

In the ethereal state, Luo Tian faced a challenge—a red sword beam blocking his path.

“Crush…” Without hesitation, Luo Tian met the red blade.

“Burst….” Waves of energy surged from Luo Tian, and the sword energy within the Illusion Sword Array suddenly rushed toward the seated Luo Tian.

This silent collision caused Luo Tian to open his eyes, a flash of sword energy in them. He reached for the Dragon Abyss on his back.

This time, the Dragon Abyss no longer resisted Luo Tian; even suppressing its power had lessened by one level.

“Has it accepted you?” Luo Tian gently caressed the warm scabbard, now sensing the cold aura beneath it—coming from the Dragon Abyss. Though still resisting, it no longer fiercely opposed.

Luo Tian’s face bore a smile. Previously, if someone forcibly took the Dragon Abyss from him, it would be like this—once he used his power to suppress it, he could control the Dragon Abyss.

But now was different; there was a slight acceptance. Even if the Dragon Abyss were stolen, as Luo Tian had said, it would only choose another upon his death.

This didn’t mean Luo Tian wouldn’t suppress the Dragon Abyss—just a form of acceptance, acknowledging his right to wield it.

“Thank you, elder!” Luo Tian bowed slightly, gazing at Du Jianxing.

Though only seven days had passed, to Luo Tian it felt like an eternity. His gains were immense—gaining the Dragon Abyss’ slight acceptance and mastering the初级 (beginner) realm of ‘Sword-Body Unity.’

If this were known, it would surely shock people—seven days to enter ‘Sword-Body Unity’—a speed that left others in awe.

But Luo Tian knew this was due to Du Jianxing’s Illusion Sword Array and the sword marks on the mountain peak. Without that, he wouldn’t have advanced so quickly. Now Du Jianxing had become towering in Luo Tian’s eyes—respect for a master after mastering sword art.

“Alright, come here every day to meditate for an hour!”

“And remember, if you’ve mastered other weapons’ paths, you must forget them entirely—otherwise, you’ll never reach the peak!” Du Jianxing spoke softly, waving his hand to send Luo Tian to a courtyard.

“Where is this?” Luo Tian was momentarily stunned, having just arrived at the Rotating Palace and never even entered its gates.

“This is where Du Tianming, the commander, once lived!” Just as Luo Tian’s words finished, a deep voice echoed in his ears.

An elder cloaked in black mist stood beside Luo Tian, his aura radiating True Immortal Late Period.

“Who are you?” Luo Tian was startled, the elder’s sudden appearance catching him off guard.

“I am the guardian of this level, Du Li. You’ll live here from now on!” The elder spoke, his grin sinister despite the smile.

“What ghost is this?” Luo Tian immediately sensed the elder was not human but a ghost, his mind trembling slightly.

“Elder, could you introduce the Rotating Palace to me? I’ve never entered it before…” Luo Tian quickly spoke, his voice respectful.

“We Rotating Palace has nine hundred and ninety-nine levels. Each is vast, housing disciples or elders of the Rotating Palace!”

“The first thirty-three levels house outer disciples; the middle thirty-three levels house inner disciples, and the last thirty-three levels house elders, eight Immortals, and the mysterious palace master!”

“This courtyard is on the ninety-ninth level—the highest in the Rotating Palace. Though the ghostly qi here is thin, it’s still better than outside.”

“Back then, Du Tianming少爷 climbed from this courtyard all the way to the sixty-sixth level before choosing to join the Mad Ghost Army.”

“In the Rotating Palace, regardless of whether you are human or ghost, with strength, anything can be seized—include courtyards! Even inner disciple positions!”

“Of course, if your strength is great, you can seize lower courtyards. But survival is uncertain! Be careful!” The elder spoke endlessly, giving Luo Tian a brief understanding of the Rotating Palace.

“Beast Ghost King City, Luo family’s direct descendant Luo Chen—strong, awarded the ninety-ninth level courtyard as an outer disciple!” Just as Du Li’s words finished, Du Jianxing’s authoritative voice echoed in the ninety-ninth-level hall.

“Luo Chen—this is the one who entered and bloodied the Rotating Palace’s gates, even killing a True Immortal Late Period!”

“Indeed! It is said this person is ruthless, killing anyone who disagrees. No survivors under his hand—cruel!” The crowd murmured.

The people living on the ninety-ninth level sighed deeply, knowing such a ruthless person would never stay long. Thus, they had no worries.

But those below the ninety-ninth level were anxious, sighing inwardly at their luck—hoping not to be targeted by Luo Tian, challenging them for courtyards.

However, they weren’t overly concerned; the Rotating Palace had countless disciples—each level housed nearly ten thousand. Who would be so unlucky to find them?

Some strong disciples, however, glowed with excitement. They had only recently heard of Luo Tian’s fierce battles outside the Rotating Palace, even hearing he possessed many treasures—enough to make True Immortal Peak elders envious.

“Hurry up and take it down! I’m waiting for you on the fifty-third level. If you don’t come down, I’ll go up to find you—I’m waiting on the forty-first level!” A few renowned disciples shouted, urging Luo Tian to descend.

Chapter 2126: Why Them ()

Luo Tian ignored the shouting, not vying for lower-level courtyards. He remained on the ninety-ninth level, training alone. Ye Chen was also released by Luo Tian, but no one paid much attention—after all, who doesn’t have a few attendants?

“What do you want?” Ye Chen asked immediately upon emerging, unable to read Luo Tian’s expression.
