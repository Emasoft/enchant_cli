“Why have you come here?” Yun Wuya addressed Tong Yangjian and his companions, his voice laced with impatience. He longed to leave the Seven Star Island and rescue Elder Shi from the Stone寨.

“We wish for Luo Tian to witness our void-fighting warships. Perhaps he may offer assistance!” Tong Yangjian, perceiving Yun Wuya’s impatience, directly stated their purpose.

“Very well. I shall be away for a while; the Seven Star Island now rests in your hands!” Yun Wuya immediately agreed, handing Luo Tian his sword, the Wuya Sword, and addressing Tong Yangjian’s group.

“Senior, I must return this sword to you. It belongs to its rightful owner!” Luo Tian waved his hand, sending the Wuya Sword back into Yun Wuya’s grasp.

Yun Wuya took no offense, reclaiming the sword and vanishing from Luo Tian’s sight.

“Be cautious, Elder!” Tong Yangjian called out into the dark星空, his face etched with concern.

“Alas…” Luo Tian sighed deeply within himself. He wondered whether informing Yun Wuya about the Stone寨 was a blessing or a curse.

“Rest easy, Elder’s strength is profound. He shall be fine!” Feng Yong sighed softly, drawing the group’s attention back.

“Let us go,” Tong Yangjian knew that matters of the Epoch Midpoint were beyond their reach. They could only hope for Yun Wuya’s safe return.

The group flew away, and after an hour of travel, they arrived before a colossal warship resembling a mountain.

“Is this…?” Luo Tian’s eyes widened in astonishment upon approaching the vessel.

The ancient warship bore seven radiant dragons coiled around it, their bodies pulsing with regulated spiritual energy. The ship’s surface was etched with intricate patterns—each dragon composed of spiritual veins.

“This is the result of our Seven Star Island’s years of preparation, a vessel forged from countless resources. Its hull is crafted from the bones of a thousand-year-old dragon, impenetrable!” Tong Yangjian spoke with pride as he explained.

“You know that this starfield is sealed by the Lord of Intercepting Heaven. Only those from the Epoch Beginning may traverse the stars, let alone cross voids!”

“This vessel is fortified with countless arrays and the resilience of dragon bones, enabling it to traverse voids!” Tong Yangjian addressed Luo Tian.

“This ship’s value is immeasurable,” Luo Tian mused, acknowledging its worth. Though it paled in comparison to Epoch Treasures, it was nearly equivalent.

“Yet this vessel cannot be activated. We lack the node leading to the Nine Realms,” Tong Yangjian’s expression darkened, his gaze turning to Luo Tian.

“The node leading to the Nine Realms!” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, a bitter ache in his heart. He had no knowledge of such nodes within the Origin Domain.

“Can you still sense anything from the Nine Realms? Perhaps there remains a chance!” Tong Yangjian urged Luo Tian.

“No,” Luo Tian responded after attempting to sense the ancient palace. No trace emerged.

“Then it seems hopeless. If you could sense it, we might traverse the void through this vessel and attempt entry into the Nine Realms. Alas!” Tong Yangjian sighed, shaking his head.

Luo Tian exhaled deeply, disappointment welling within him. This was his sole means of returning to the Nine Realms—now seemingly sealed.

“Let us think of other methods later. Perhaps there is still hope!” Tong Yangjian’s voice carried resignation.

The six of them departed, their spirits heavy, vanishing into the dark星空 and arriving at the palace’s exterior.

“Grandmaster, Guan Xingjian has returned!” As they exited the palace, a disciple with a long sword on his back hurried to Tong Yangjian’s side.

Chapter 1257: Guan Xingjian Returns

“Xingjian has returned?” Tong Yangjian’s face lit with relief. Since learning of Guan Xingjian’s plight, he had remained in constant anxiety. Guan Xingjian was the Seven Star Island’s treasure; otherwise, Elder Yun would not have ventured to rescue him.

“But… Guan Xingjian has been wounded. He is currently under Elder Yun’s care!” The disciple spoke, his voice trembling.

“Xingjian was injured?” Tong Yangjian’s expression darkened further. The other island masters exchanged anxious glances.

Luo Tian sighed inwardly; Guan Xingjian was indeed a prodigy, enduring the Seven Star Island’s rescue efforts.

“Apologies,” Luo Tian muttered to himself, a pang of guilt. If not for his battle with Man Jiang and Man Hai, they would have mistaken him for Guan Xingjian.

“Luo Tian, accompany us to see him. As a cultivator of elixirs, you may be of assistance!” Tong Yangjian implored, his eyes pleading.

Guan Xingjian was Tong Yangjian’s disciple; though they were master and student, their bond was akin to father and son. Now wounded and under Elder Yun’s care, his condition was dire.

“Very well,” Luo Tian rubbed his nose. Though reluctant to face Guan Xingjian, he felt responsible for the injury.

The group flew toward the First Island. Soon they arrived at the Sword Mountain of the First Island.

Amidst the respectful gazes of the First Island disciples, they entered a secluded courtyard. The air was rich with spiritual energy, and Luo Tian noted the mountain wall behind it, scarred by countless sword marks.

“A true swordsman!” Luo Tian muttered, smirking at the marks. Clearly, these were not made in a day.

“That is Xingjian’s childhood practice scars. They’ve faded over the years,” Tong Yangjian smiled, explaining to Luo Tian.

As they entered a spacious room, a fierce spiritual pressure enveloped them. The air stirred their robes.

Inside the chamber, an elder sat cross-legged on the ground, beside a withered body. The figure was shrouded in black qi, its form flickering with dark runes.

Seven green swords stood upright around them. Starlight flowed from the blades, converging above the two figures before being drawn into the withered body by the elder.

“Is that Guan Xingjian?” Luo Tian’s lips twitched, staring at the frail figure.

It was pitiful. Guan Xingjian’s life force had dwindled to near nothing, his vitality fading rapidly. His body was withered and gaunt, like an old man—only the pain on his face hinted at his youth.

“Why is this happening?” Tong Yangjian’s eyes widened in alarm, but he was repelled by the seven swords.

“Curse!” Luo Tian murmured, sensing a curse akin to Yang Jingyu’s but far stronger. Guan Xingjian could not withstand it.

“Indeed, a curse—age’s curse! Cast by the蛮族’s Sa Man,” the elder within the Seven Swords Array spoke, his face grim.

Hearing this, Tong Yangjian and Feng Yong turned to Luo Tian. They knew Luo Tian had previously purged Yang Jingyu’s curse.

“I am powerless. This curse is too strong; even the Thunder-Subduing Elixir may not suppress it. If my guess is correct, this curse was cast by an Epoch Midpoint cultivator!” Luo Tian shook his head.

Though the Thunder-Subduing Elixir was extraordinary, it could only withstand one Epoch Beginning’s heavenly tribulation. A curse from the Epoch Midpoint was terrifying—neither Guan Xingjian nor even Luo Tian could withstand it.

“What shall we do?” Tong Yangjian’s eyes brimmed with urgency, sweat beading on his forehead.

“Only an Immortal Divine Herb could save him,” Luo Tian replied, a reluctant sorrow in his voice. Guan Xingjian’s injury was tied to him.

Hearing this, the room fell silent. The Origin Domain was resource-scarce; even Holy Medicines were hard to find.

Luo Tian retrieved a jade vial, pouring out an elixir. It was the Thunder-Subduing Elixir he had previously crafted—three drops of stone milk, yielding three elixirs. One was given to Yang Jingyu; two remained with Luo Tian.

“This is the Thunder-Subduing Elixir. It may offer some relief, but it will not last long,” Luo Tian spoke softly.

“This is the Blood-Refining Elixir, crafted from a Holy Medicine. It enhances bloodline strength and delays the process,” Luo Tian added without waiting for their response, presenting his best elixirs.

“Regardless, we must stabilize him first,” the elder within the Seven Swords Array said, gazing at Luo Tian with gratitude. He seized the elixirs and administered them to Guan Xingjian.

After consuming the Thunder-Subduing and Blood-Refining Elixirs, Guan Xingjian’s condition improved slightly. The black qi no longer circled his body but seeped into it, and his withered form regained some vitality. Green veins appeared on his gaunt body.

“Hmph,” the elder sighed, rising from his meditation. He stepped out of the Seven Swords Array.

“Another Epoch Midpoint!” Luo Tian marveled, witnessing another such cultivator emerge in an instant.

“This domain was sealed. How many Epoch Midpoints are here? And why are there more Epoch Beginnings than the Nine Realms?” Luo Tian pondered, but he bowed respectfully with Tong Yangjian and others to the elder.

“White Ancestral, how long can Xingjian endure?” Tong Yangjian asked. Feng Yong conveyed to Luo Tian that this elder was one of the Three Ancestors of the Seven Star Island.

The other two ancestors were Yun Wuya and the beast beneath the icy cliff.

“Enough with the formalities,” the elder spoke slowly, observing Guan Xingjian within the array. “I have used the Seven Swords Array’s starlight to protect his meridians. With Luo Tian’s elixirs, there has been some improvement. The curse’s erosion has slowed, but it will not last long—perhaps a year at most. After that, there is no other way; the result will be the same.”

“What can we do? Where could we find an Immortal Divine Herb?” Tong Yangjian’s face bore worry, his gaze on the elder.

“There is no solution. The Seven Star Island has only a few Holy Medicines. As for Immortal Divine Herbs, we may not find them even if we scoured the entire蛮族 continent. Perhaps seeking beyond it, across the starfield, might yield a faint chance,” the elder sighed.

“Immortal Divine Herb!” Luo Tian thought of his own body, formed from an Immortal妙Tree. But he could not expect Guan Xingjian to consume him.

“Let us gather all the Holy Medicines from the Seven Star Island for emergencies. Though their potency pales compared to Immortal Divine Herbs, they may delay the process. We’ll find solutions later,” the elder commanded.

“I shall go to the Seven Star Seas and then beyond the蛮族 continent. I’ll search,” the elder instructed Tong Yangjian, then departed from the Seven Star Island.

“Let us collect all the Holy Medicines from each island,” Tong Yangjian ordered, issuing commands.

“Forgive me. I will use my blood to sustain him if all else fails,” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, flying back to his residence.

Upon returning, Luo Tian resumed his recovery. Though the injuries from his battle with Hu Tianzong had improved, he still needed rest.

As Luo Tian recovered, the Seven Star Island plunged into chaos. The news of Guan Xingjian’s severe injury under Elder Bai Ze’s care spread swiftly.

Though the Seven Star Island often quarreled, they were united in times of crisis. Even the stingy Shen Gongfu produced a Holy Medicine. Soon, all the Seven Star Island disciples gathered five Holy Medicines and delivered them to Tong Yangjian.

Elder Bai Ze returned from the Seven Star Seas a few days later, bringing three more Holy Medicines. Then he departed again from the Seven Star Island.

The islanders did not idle; they scoured the island for news of Immortal Divine Herbs. But with the Seven Star Island’s limited size, they had already searched it thoroughly—no trace of such herbs.

Time passed swiftly. A month later, Luo Tian’s injuries were fully recovered; he had returned to his peak condition.

“Wonder how their progress is,” Luo Tian opened his eyes, murmuring softly.

Yet he shook his head. An Immortal Divine Herb was so extraordinary; finding one in a month was impossible.

Luo Tian stepped out of the courtyard, his face etched with regret. He flew toward Guan Xingjian’s residence.

Chapter 1258: News of the Immortal Divine Herb

The Seven Star Island. Luo Tian walked into Guan Xingjian’s residence, where Tong Yangjian sat in deep sorrow. His face bore exhaustion as he gazed at Guan Xingjian lying within the Seven Swords Array.

“Grandmaster, how is he?” Luo Tian entered the room, observing Guan Xingjian’s faint vitality.

“Some Holy Medicines have prolonged his life slightly, but it is a drop in the ocean. He won’t last long,” Tong Yangjian sighed.

“Any news of an Immortal Divine Herb?” Luo Tian asked, but seeing the despair in Tong Yangjian’s eyes, he knew there had been no progress.

“None. All the island disciples have searched thoroughly, but found nothing. Elder Bai Ze’s return also brought no news,” Tong Yangjian shook his head.

“If I were in the Nine Realms, I might have some ideas—knowing a few places where Immortal Divine Herbs exist. But here in the Origin Domain, with my current strength, I cannot leave,” Luo Tian frowned, determined to aid Guan Xingjian’s curse.

“Fate will decide. There are still two years left. If no solution is found by then, Xingjian’s only path is death,” Tong Yangjian sighed, his face filled with resentment.

“Two years are too short!” Luo Tian frowned, stepping into the Seven Swords Array. At that moment, it was controlled by Tong Yangjian, who did not stop Luo Tian.

Luo Tian extended his hand, grasping one of the Seven Swords. His palm sliced across the blade’s edge, red light flashing.

“What are you doing?” Tong Yangjian looked puzzled, unsure of Luo Tian’s intent.

But the next moment, Tong Yangjian’s eyes widened in disbelief. He gazed at Luo Tian’s palm.

Luo Tian’s palm was cut by the Seven Sword, blood spilling. His golden blood resembled divine essence, radiating immense vitality. Tong Yangjian felt this blood contained powerful life force—comparable to the Holy Medicines given to Guan Xingjian.

“Grandmaster didn’t know that Reincarnation Body blood is a great nourishment?” Luo Tian smiled, approaching Guan Xingjian. His blood dripped into Guan Xingjian’s withered mouth.

A thunderous sound echoed within Guan Xingjian, as if a mighty dragon roamed his body. His complexion improved instantly, and Tong Yangjian’s face lit with joy.

“He won’t die. Even if the Holy Medicines run out, I’ll sustain him with my blood until we find an Immortal Divine Herb,” Luo Tian did not reveal his body was formed from the Immortal妙Tree, instead attributing it to the Reincarnation Body.

Tong Yangjian’s face was filled with excitement and gratitude. He could sense that Guan Xingjian would be fine for at least five years with Luo Tian’s blood.

“Alas,” seeing Tong Yangjian’s expression, Luo Tian had no words. He wondered how Tong Yangjian would react if he learned the truth.

Tong Yangjian was unaware that Luo Tian had used not ordinary blood, but his own essence blood, which yielded such potent results.

“When will you enter the Epoch Beginning?” Tong Yangjian asked, his tone inquisitive.

“Perhaps soon,” Luo Tian shook his head. He felt he could summon the Epoch Beginning’s heavenly tribulation at any moment.

The rules of this Origin Domain seemed different from those of the Nine Realms. Entering the Epoch Beginning was arduous in the Nine Realms.

Yet Luo Tian sensed his Epoch Heavenly Tribulation was unlike others. If he miscalculated, he might perish in it—a primal instinct.

“I’ll take my leave. I’ve been thinking—perhaps there is something in the Seven Star Island that connects to the Nine Realms. Maybe we can find it!” Luo Tian said, still hopeful about the void warship.

“Indeed,” Tong Yangjian shook his head. They had never entered the Nine Realms before. Even if such an artifact were placed before them, they wouldn’t know its connection to the Nine Realms.

Luo Tian sighed deeply. Now, he had no items connected to the Nine Realms—only the Epoch Book.

After thinking of this, he immediately attempted to activate the Epoch Art, trying to connect with other pages of the Nine Realms. But the Epoch Book remained unchanged, floating in his mind without responding.

Luo Tian rose to leave. His purpose here was to check Guan Xingjian’s condition and offer his help. With his blood, he had extended Guan Xingjian’s life.

After bidding Tong Yangjian farewell, Luo Tian began scouring the Seven Star Island for anything that could connect to the Nine Realms.

After seven days of thorough searching, he had turned the entire Seven Star Island upside down but found no clues. His disappointment was immense.

“If all else fails, I’ll take the risk to enter the Epoch Beginning. No matter what, I must return to the Nine Realms. It’s been too long!” Luo Tian’s face was resolute, planning to search for a few more days. If no solution emerged, he would leave the Seven Star Island and seek in the蛮族 continent. If not there, then across the Origin Domain—he believed he would find it.

“Deputy Grandmaster!” That day, as Luo Tian returned to his residence, Shen Gongfei’s voice echoed in his ears.

“What is it?” Shen Gongfei looked anxious, his plump figure appearing before Luo Tian. These days, Shen Gongfei had benefited from Luo Tian’s elixirs, finally advancing to the Holy Man Beginning.

“My uncle is looking for you!” Shen Gongfei addressed Luo Tian. His uncle was the Third Island’s Grandmaster, Shen Gongfu.

“Island Master?” Hearing this, Luo Tian smiled. Shen Gongfu had not approached him since his last escape.

“I almost forgot—there’s still a debt to settle with this old man!” Luo Tian’s voice carried anger. He and Shen Gongfei arrived at Shen Gongfu’s residence.

“Deputy Grandmaster, enter. I’ll wait outside,” Shen Gongfei respectfully said.

“Hmph!” Luo Tian nodded, then took a deep breath. His face turned red, his breathing became heavy.

“Shen Gongfu! You dare to show your face!” Luo Tian roared, his voice like thunder. Shen Gongfei jumped high in surprise, unable to comprehend why the Deputy Grandmaster had suddenly changed.

Luo Tian kicked open Shen Gongfu’s courtyard door, his face red with anger as he entered. One might think Shen Gongfu had committed a grievous sin.

“Haha, Deputy Grandmaster has arrived!” Shen Gongfu smiled, taking small steps. His eyes gleamed with cunning as he stepped out of the door, seemingly ignoring Luo Tian’s roar.

“Deputy Grandmaster! Haha, it's a joke. I’m quitting this position. You find someone else to take it!” Luo Tian shouted, as if wronged, throwing his Deputy Grandmaster’s token at Shen Gongfu.

“What happened?” Shen Gongfei was confused, watching the furious Luo Tian.

Even more surprising to Shen Gongfei was that his uncle showed no anger, instead smiling and leading Luo Tian into the hall.

“Hmph?” As Luo Tian entered the hall, he was about to scold Shen Gongfu. But upon seeing several people seated inside—led by Second Island Master Feng Yong—he paused.

“Deputy Grandmaster, calm down!” Shen Gongfu smiled, seating Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s gaze swept the hall. He recognized most of those present—apart from several island masters, there were two young figures. One was cold, carrying a large sword on his back. Upon seeing Luo Tian, he nodded slightly.

The other was none other than Hu Tianzong, whom Luo Tian had defeated days prior. As soon as Luo Tian entered the hall, Hu Tianzong’s eyes did not leave him; his gaze was fixed on Luo Tian.

“Old man, explain how you’ll compensate me!” Luo Tian transmitted to Shen Gongfu, his voice threatening.

“Let’s split the profits three-seventy!” Shen Gongfu transmitted back, his voice laced with pain.

Luo Tian was surprised. He hadn’t expected Shen Gongfu to be so generous, offering him seven-tenths of the profits. It was quite unexpected.

“Is that not enough?” Shen Gongfu patted Luo Tian’s shoulder, appearing generous.

Luo Tian felt something was off but couldn’t immediately discern it. He transmitted his agreement, then asked Feng Yong: “Second Island Master, what is this about?”

During this time, Tong Yangjian had been tending to Guan Xingjian. Thus, the Seven Star Island’s affairs were now under Feng Yong’s leadership.

“About the Immortal Divine Herb!” Feng Yong smiled, but his tone was solemn.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered. He hadn’t expected news of the Immortal Divine Herb so soon.

Chapter 1259: The Sea’s Edge

“Immortal Divine Herb?” Luo Tian’s heart skipped a beat. If they could find it, Guan Xingjian would recover, easing Luo Tian’s guilt.

Yet his heart was solemn. He knew the Immortal Divine Herb wasn’t easily obtained. Great opportunities often came with great dangers—like the Tian Huan Shen Mo Flower, which Jiang Nanxuan had barely survived to fuse with.

Feng Yong waved his hand, revealing a tattered map. It caught Luo Tian’s attention.

“This map was obtained by a disciple. It seems to be from before the starfield was sealed—likely a map of the Seven Star Island. This location may be where the Immortal Divine Herb is located!” Feng Yong pointed to a lotus-shaped mark on the map.

“The Sea’s Edge?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow. He didn’t ask how Feng Yong identified the lotus mark as the Sea’s Edge but recognized it immediately.

“Indeed, the Sea’s Edge!” Feng Yong turned to Yang Jingyu, who was most familiar with it.

“I’m not sure. I’ve only visited three battlefields and never explored the Sea’s Edge thoroughly,” Yang Jingyu shook his head.

“Regardless, now that we have a lead, let’s investigate. The Sea’s Edge opens once every ten years—three months remain.”

“The rules within the Sea’s Edge differ from those of the蛮族 continent. Those over five hundred years old are prohibited from entering.”

“This opening’s priority is to find the Immortal Divine Herb. Thus, we’ve decided that Jingyu, Tianzong, and you three will enter the Sea’s Edge to search. That is why I called you here—what are your thoughts?” Feng Yong addressed Luo Tian.

“Do you mean I must cooperate with him?” Luo Tian glanced at Hu Tianzong, who stared back with hostility.

They would enter the Sea’s Edge. Yang Jingyu would command those stationed there to fight against the蛮族, leaving Luo Tian and Hu Tianzong to search for the Immortal Divine Herb.

Considering their past tensions, Luo Tian felt uneasy. If they encountered the Immortal Divine Herb, it would surely be fraught with danger—Hu Tianzong might sabotage him. It was better for him to search alone.

“What do you mean?” Hu Tianzong bristled, his gaze on Luo Tian with teeth clenched. He thought Luo Tian was belittling his strength.

“Don’t worry, there will be no issues. Before you leave, you must swear blood oaths!” Feng Yong, the Second Island Master of the Seven Star Island, knew Luo Tian’s thoughts. He dispelled his concerns.

“Very well,” Luo Tian nodded and agreed, gazing at Hu Tianzong with a smile.

In truth, no matter what, Luo Tian would go. It wasn’t just about finding the Immortal Divine Herb but also searching for items that could connect to the Nine Realms. He knew places with Immortal Divine Herbs would also hold other treasures.

“Good, then it’s decided. Three months later, you three must arrive at the Observatory to be sent into the Sea’s Edge,” Feng Yong smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

Seeing Luo Tian agree, the others had no further need to stay. They discussed some trivial matters before departing.

“Brother, the Sea’s Edge is my territory. Rest assured, no蛮族 will dare touch you!” Yang Jingyu smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

“Don’t worry. I won’t hold you back. When I enter the Epoch Beginning, I’ll challenge you,” Hu Tianzong’s gaze was deep as he exited the hall.

The group departed one by one, leaving only Shen Gongfu and Luo Tian in the hall. Luo Tian’s face was now smiling, no longer angry toward Shen Gongfu. He addressed him: “Grandmaster, about our previous agreement—do you plan to fulfill it?”

“Ah, of course!” Hearing this, Shen Gongfu’s lips twitched. His heart felt like it was bleeding as he handed Luo Tian a storage pouch.

Luo Tian took the pouch but his expression changed. He gazed at Shen Gongfu: “This isn’t right. It was supposed to be three-seventy, but this is too little!”

“Indeed, it’s three-seventy. I take seven, you take three!” Shen Gongfu looked at Luo Tian with a ‘you’re being picky’ expression, but to Luo Tian it meant he had been tricked.

“Damn!” Luo Tian threw the pouch back into Shen Gongfu’s hands. He added, “Fourth Island Master, wait for me—I’m going to the Fourth Island!”

“Deputy Grandmaster, what do you mean? We had already agreed!” Shen Gongfu smiled nervously.

Luo Tian was blocked by Shen Gongfu. Then, as if suddenly recalling something, he smiled at Shen Gongfu: “Grandmaster, I don’t need the spiritual stones. But my Wuya Sword was taken by Elder Yun Wuya. My journey to the Sea’s Edge is perilous. Do you think I should be given a suitable treasure?”

Hearing he didn’t need the spiritual stones, Shen Gongfu’s eyes lit up. He gazed at Luo Tian, his pupils rolling: “Of course!”

“Also, I demand the Third Island’s inheritance!” Luo Tian gazed at Shen Gongfu, speaking each word clearly.

“N… no…” Shen Gongfu was about to agree but his eyes widened in disbelief. Luo Tian was startled—Shen Gongfu’s eyes were so large.

“Are you serious? You want the Third Island’s inheritance?” Shen Gongfu seemed not to have heard Luo Tian, asking again.

“Yes, I am,” Luo Tian nodded with a smile.

“Impossible. The Third Island’s inheritance is so precious. Only those who have made great contributions to the Seven Star Island may obtain it,” Shen Gongfu shook his head.

“Great contributions? Then I’ll try the Fourth Island. Also, return my spiritual stones!” Luo Tian extended his hand. He had noticed Shen Gongfu was a man who never spoke the truth, especially when it came to spiritual stones. He would find ways to deceive him.

“This… fine! I’ll make an exception for you,” Shen Gongfu seemed to have made a decision, addressing Luo Tian.

“Good. Let’s choose treasures first,” Luo Tian bypassed Shen Gongfu’s words, knowing he would agree.

“Not today. I forgot the key. Tomorrow,” Shen Gongfu feigned difficulty, addressing Luo Tian.

“Very well,” Luo Tian knew Shen Gongfu’s intentions. He didn’t confront him, nodding in agreement. He knew the treasure vault would be unpredictable tomorrow.

Luo Tian said his goodbyes and returned to his courtyard. He sat cross-legged on the bed, deep in thought.

“Difficult,” Luo Tian sighed softly. He felt his path was fraught with challenges. Everything relied on himself—no ancient palace, no Yin Fish, no powerful mentors.

“Alas,” he sighed. No matter what, he must return to the Nine Realms. The only solution was to strengthen himself. If he reached the Epoch Peak, he could go anywhere.

Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with determination. He closed his eyes and began to cultivate.

The next morning, Luo Tian directly went to Shen Gongfu’s residence. He found Shen Gongfu with some fatigue, already waiting there.

“Let’s go,” Shen Gongfu smiled, leading Luo Tian to the Third Island’s treasure vault. Only Shen Gongfu could open it.

“Enter, choose freely,” Shen Gongfu smiled generously, appearing magnanimous.

Luo Tian wanted to stomp on Shen Gongfu’s face but ignored him, stepping into the treasure vault.
