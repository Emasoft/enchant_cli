“Ah, this is the leaf of the Qiankun Shenghun Tree!” Luo Tian let out a soft laugh, sitting with Sun Mengru as they began to sip tea.

“Truly extravagant. I long to take a single sip; my cultivation would surely surge!” Those awaiting treatment bore greedy expressions, gazing upon the pot of tea beside Luo Tian, murmuring among themselves.

“Then there are these treasures. If I possessed one, it would be equivalent to my life!” The crowd soon shifted their gazes toward Zheng Xin’s treasures.

Yet, they merely gazed; none dared to act openly, for Yan Hongtao, the city’s lord, sat there, and beside him was Luo Tian, who had slain Yan Haobo.

“Next…” A gentle voice echoed again. Those momentarily dazed were roused, their eyes once more reverent as they turned toward the room.

Not long after, each injured person emerged from the chamber with joyous expressions, bowing respectfully as they left the courtyard.

“Hongtao, why did you find time to visit me? And brought so many friends?” A gentle voice echoed as the door opened, revealing a figure clad in white silk.

His white robes were snow-like, his long hair cascading freely, appearing carefree yet exuding a warm aura. He appeared scholarly, his eyes deep and unusual—Run Hongyu’s eyes were pale green.

“Is this the renowned Luo Tian?” As Luo Tian appraised Run Hongyu, so did he return the gaze. After a brief exchange, Run Hongyu spoke softly.

“Time is just right; why not partake in a cup of tea?” Luo Tian’s gaze held a smile, inviting Run Hongyu. His first impression of Run Hongyu was favorable.

“Then I shall take advantage of your generosity!” Run Hongyu’s lips curled, stepping forward toward Luo Tian and his companions.

“Using the leaves of an Immortal Soul Medicine to brew tea—only Luo Xiong could possess such a talent!” Run Hongyu took a delicate sip, his body enveloped in verdant radiance, as if transforming into an ancient tree, exuding abundant vitality.

“Damn it, Luo Tian, hurry and let this fellow restore our freedom!” Seeing Luo Tian and his companions sipping tea, Diao Dedu and the others immediately transmitted their thoughts to Luo Tian.

“Stay still for a while,” Luo Tian observed Diao Dedu and the others, feeling rare tranquility. He mused that after becoming familiar with Run Hongyu, he would learn this skill too; if these fools continued to chatter, he’d pierce them with a single needle.

“Why have you come?” Run Hongyu smiled at Yan Hongtao, then turned his gaze to Luo Tian.

“Big Brother Run, we’ve come seeking your aid. Luo Tian and his companions wish to find the Bone Forest and search for the White Bone Spirit Bamboo within it,” Yan Hongtao spoke directly, revealing Luo Tian’s intent.

“The Bone Forest?” Run Hongyu’s brows furrowed slightly before responding, “The Bone Forest is a perilous place. Without the cultivation of an Epoch Lord, I advise you not to venture recklessly.”

“Big Brother Run, can you merely locate the entrance of the Bone Forest? As for the rest, I have my own measures,” Luo Tian spoke firmly.

“I might indeed locate it through my bloodline’s guidance, but my current physical state is unfit for travel. Moreover, I find you likable and do not wish to see you perish; thus, you should not go,” Run Hongyu added.

“I understand. My body bears a curse; if you trust me, I can attempt to relieve it,” Run Hongyu smiled.

“Even if I cannot fully remove it, I can suppress it for a while. Do not venture into the Bone Forest,” Run Hongyu reiterated, assuming Luo Tian sought to break the curse.

“Big Brother Run, what ails your body?” Yan Hongtao’s expression shifted slightly upon hearing Run Hongyu’s words.

“Nothing. Rest assured, I used my medical skills to extend my life by a century,” Run Hongyu smiled.

Luo Tian’s group focused on the latter part of Run Hongyu’s words—the possibility of suppressing or even removing Luo Tian’s curse.

“Can this curse truly be removed?” Sun Mengru’s eyes gleamed, gazing at Run Hongyu. She did not wish Luo Tian to endure the torment of burning his soul nightly.

“It should be manageable…” Run Hongyu nodded gently. “Do not underestimate any entity; where there is existence, there must be reason. Even mundane things, when perfected, can defy heaven.”

“Thank you, Big Brother Run. Regardless, I beg you to guide me to the Bone Forest’s entrance. I have another matter within it. As a token of gratitude, I can lend you one Immortal Soul Medicine for a month; perhaps it will aid you,” Luo Tian spoke softly. After their brief exchange, he felt Run Hongyu was a commendable person—unlike an assassin, but rather one with a healer’s heart.

“An Immortal Soul Medicine?” Run Hongyu’s eyes flashed with sharpness, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Indeed, I require it to prolong my life. Mortals naturally wish to live; none are exempt from this desire since ancient times,” Run Hongyu smiled.

“Seven days hence, the Immortal Soul Medicine shall arrive!” Luo Tian addressed Run Hongyu, then turned his gaze toward Diao Dedu and the others, who were immobilized.

“Please release these men!” Luo Tian’s gaze held a smile as he observed their angry and sorrowful expressions, feeling it was sufficient.

“You’ve made a friend in me, Run Hongyu!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Run Hongyu smiled. As the son of an Epoch Lord, he naturally understood the value of an Immortal Soul Medicine; Luo Tian lending him one for a month signified his trust in Run Hongyu.

Subsequently, Run Hongyu waved his hand, and the silver needles on Diao Dedu’s body disintegrated into powder, vanishing from their forms.

“Ah…!” As the needles disappeared, Diao Dedu and Sun Kemin regained their freedom.

“You dare attack us!” Their gazes then turned toward Run Hongyu, faces alight with anger. The group surrounded him, preparing to assault.

“Buzz…” Run Hongyu showed no fear, raising his hand. A few silver needles materialized above his head, and he gazed at Diao Dedu with a smile.

At the needles’ appearance, Diao Dedu and the others instinctively took a step back.

Chapter 1584: Suppressing the Curse

“Diao Dedu, you’re swift. Take the chance before he acts and subdue him!” Sun Kemin urged Diao Dedu.

“Go to hell, none of you are good men. I won’t act!” Diao Dedu would not heed them. He did not believe his speed could evade those enigmatic silver needles; if he were immobilized, he would not wish to relive Zheng Xin’s fate.

“Damn it, why do you single me out?” Zheng Xin’s voice echoed in their ears. He charged toward Sun Kemin; had Sun Kemin not led the others, they would not have taken his belongings.

“Damn it, it’s not just me. They all share the blame. Why target only me?” Sun Kemin would not accept defeat.

“Enough!” Luo Tian’s face reddened, feeling deeply embarrassed.

“Forgive my friend’s behavior,” Luo Tian apologized to Run Hongyu, his gaze filled with regret.

Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the group relented slightly, sitting quietly. Yet Zheng Xin remained irate, glaring at everyone, clearly distressed over his loss.

“Nothing wrong. I quite like your friends’ personalities,” Run Hongyu spoke gently, a smile in his eyes.

“Alright, Zheng Xin and Diao Dedu, go to the Four Saints Star Domain and retrieve the Zixiao Spirit Lotus. I’ll compensate you upon your return,” Luo Tian said, observing Zheng Xin’s irritation.

Previously, after Luo Tian and his group rescued Chen Zhanbiao, they had entrusted the Zixiao Spirit Lotus to Jiang Nanxuan for transport to the Four Saints Star Domain.

“Compensation?” Zheng Xin’s face brightened slightly. He knew Luo Tian would not be stingy.

“Go then,” Luo Tian said, and Yan Hongtao smiled, leading Zheng Xin and Diao Dedu out of the clinic.

The next morning, Luo Tian and Sun Mengru arrived at Run Hongyu’s doorstep, faces alight with anticipation. The door opened, revealing an ancient and serene room.

“Come,” Run Hongyu’s voice echoed within the chamber. Luo Tian and Sun Mengru stepped inside.

“Apologies,” Luo Tian bowed, sitting cross-legged. Sun Mengru stood before him, expression grave.

“Nothing to worry about. I shall merely attempt it; how long it suppresses the curse, I cannot say for certain,” Run Hongyu’s expression was grave as he retrieved a small pouch. He opened it, revealing countless silver needles before Luo Tian and Sun Mengru.

“Begin,” Luo Tian closed his eyes, awaiting Run Hongyu’s acupuncture.

“Buzz…” Run Hongyu also bore a grave expression. Facing the curse of the蛮族, he was cautious.

“These needles are forged from heavy water silver. Heavy water silver is inherently cold; thus, it aids in suppressing your curse,” Run Hongyu smiled.

“I am beginning. Fengmen穴 (Wind Gate Point)!” Run Hongyu introduced it briefly before plunging a needle into Luo Tian’s cervical vertebrae.

A cold sensation immediately coursed through Luo Tian, inexplicably bone-chilling.

“Xinyu穴 (Heart’s Storehouse Point)!” Before Luo Tian could react, Run Hongyu struck the second needle, giving him no time to respond.

“Hunmen (Soul Gate)... Yanggang (Yang Pole)…” Each needle transformed into a streak of cold light, piercing Luo Tian’s vital points one by one.

With each needle embedded, a thunderous rumble echoed within Luo Tian’s body. His formidable blood and qi seemed to awaken with each puncture, mingling with the cold essence of the heavy water silver needles. This cold energy flowed toward Luo Tian’s soul, where the gray flame burned relentlessly.

“Da Shu穴 (Great Pivot Point)!” Run Hongyu placed the final needle, his expression lightening as he gazed at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s body was now adorned with 108 heavy water silver needles, their cold radiance seeping into his form.

“Roar…” Luo Tian’s body felt as if empowered by an unseen force, the cold blood and qi surging toward the gray flame that had tormented his soul.

“Zhi…” The cold blood and qi clashed with the gray flame, emitting a crackling sound.

“Sigh…” At their collision, Luo Tian’s face contorted. Cold sweat trickled down his forehead.

“Endure it; though painful, it is only temporary,” Run Hongyu urged Luo Tian.

“I’m fine…” Luo Tian responded before enduring the excruciating pain.

Time passed slowly. Under Run Hongyu and Sun Mengru’s watchful eyes, Luo Tian’s complexion gradually improved.

After half an hour, Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, a look of joy on his face. The gray flame upon his soul was now barely perceptible, evidently weakened by the cold blood and qi.

Yet Luo Tian knew this was only temporary; as time passed, the gray flame would gradually regenerate, returning to its original state.

Seeing Luo Tian open his eyes, Run Hongyu gestured. The silver needles flew from Luo Tian’s body and fell into the pouch, which he collected.

“Still not fully resolved,” Run Hongyu sighed. Though it was within his expectations, the result fell short of his hopes, leaving him slightly dissatisfied.

“It’s enough. The curse no longer affects me significantly,” Luo Tian spoke softly, his face far better than before.

Though he had previously endured the curse, his face bore a sickly pallor. Now, with the gray flame suppressed, a flush returned to his face.

“Rest well for several days and replenish your lost qi,” Run Hongyu advised gently.

“Mmm…” Replenishing qi was relatively easy for Luo Tian, a cultivator of elixirs.

In the following days, Luo Tian’s relationship with Run Hongyu deepened. They exchanged insights constantly; while Luo Tian lacked medical expertise, his knowledge of herbs and pharmacology surpassed Run Hongyu’s.

Run Hongyu’s insights into medicine enlightened Luo Tian, for it was said that alchemists were the evolution of healers.

Time passed four days. On the fourth day, Yan Hongtao and the others returned to Shiluo City, bringing the Immortal Soul Medicine Zixiao Spirit Lotus to Run Hongyu.

“Indeed, an Immortal Soul Medicine. With this, I can extend my life by a millennium,” Run Hongyu accepted it without refusal.

After four days of rest, Luo Tian’s lost qi was fully restored under the elixirs’ influence. Temporarily free of the curse, he returned to his peak state, radiating an invisible pressure that even Diao Dedu and the others felt.

Diao Dedu and Zheng Xin rested for a day. The next day, Run Hongyu led Luo Tian’s group out of Shiluo City.

Under the starry sky, including Gu Yongkang’s puppet, ten figures stood. These were Luo Tian and his companions exiting Shiluo City. Their faces bore surprise.

“Hmph, besides the Epoch Lord, who else could find this city?” Diao Dedu and others marveled. Though they had just exited Shiluo City, the starry sky showed no signs of disturbance; the city was nowhere to be found.

“Enough. Besides the Epoch Lord, no one could find it,” Run Hongyu smiled, then his body radiated green light. He extended a hand, and a droplet of green blood flew from his finger.

Run Hongyu waved his hands, emitting green runes that imprinted onto the blood.

“Buzz…” A series of buzzing sounds echoed from Run Hongyu’s blood, then it shot forth like a meteor toward the distance.

“Go,” Run Hongyu spoke softly. He stepped into the starry sky, chasing the blood’s direction.

“Finally found the Bone Forest!” Luo Tian’s face lit with excitement, his form darting after Run Hongyu into the starry sky.

“Legends say few have entered the Bone Forest. It must hold many treasures,” Sun Kemin’s face gleamed with greed, chasing Luo Tian and Run Hongyu.

“Such a thief! This time, you won’t get it all to yourself!” Hearing Sun Kemin’s words, Xu Liyi and Zheng Xin’s mouths twitched. Yet they too sped after the starry sky.

The blood led Luo Tian and his group on a winding journey, sometimes flying through the starry sky, other times traversing voids. After seven days of flight, they hovered over an uninhabited continent.

“This must be the entrance to the Bone Forest,” Run Hongyu observed the small uninhabited continent. He then formed a hand seal, and two green hands erupted, radiating immense power toward the continent.

“Boom… Boom…” The thunderous echoes resounded as Run Hongyu’s attack shattered the continent, reducing it to fragments drifting in the starry sky.

“Where is the entrance?” Zheng Xin and others looked puzzled, gazing at the motionless starry sky.

“Did something go wrong?” Diao Dedu and others questioned, gazing at Run Hongyu who smiled.

“Not at all. It must be here,” Run Hongyu replied, gazing toward the starry sky where the continent had been.

“Buzz…” As Run Hongyu’s words ended, a series of buzzing sounds echoed through the starry sky, drawing Diao Dedu’s gaze.

The entire starry sky began to twist gradually. A pulling force emanated from the twisted space, and soon a black hole appeared in Luo Tian’s group's view.

“Boom… Boom…” The immense pull swiftly sucked the drifting fragments into it. The force spread outward, soon affecting Luo Tian’s group.

Though their cultivation allowed them to resist the pull, the black hole instilled a sense of dread in Luo Tian’s group, as if it led to an endless abyss. Diao Dedu and others shivered involuntarily.

“What the hell is this place?” Zheng Xin asked, gazing at the ominous black hole.

“Grandfather once entered the Bone Forest and lived through a second life,” Luo Tian murmured, his gaze also filled with apprehension toward the black hole.

“This is the entrance to the Bone Forest!” Run Hongyu spoke softly. The green blood transformed into a streak of light, plunging into the black hole.

“Big Brother Run, thank you. You may return,” Luo Tian bowed to Run Hongyu, gratitude in his eyes. Finding the Bone Forest for him was already a great favor; Run Hongyu had no need to accompany them on this risk.

“Your offering of the Immortal Soul Medicine made me your friend. Moreover, my time is limited; accompanying you for a while isn’t a big deal. My father left me a heritage within it, which I must retrieve,” Run Hongyu smiled.

“Furthermore, you said someone lived through a second life within it. Perhaps I too could live through one!” Run Hongyu chuckled, then vanished into the abyssal black hole before Luo Tian could stop him.

“Thank you,” Luo Tian murmured, Run Hongyu now firmly established as a friend in his heart. He then darted after Run Hongyu into the black hole.

Sun Mengru, Diao Dedu, and others—though Luo Tian did not wish for them to risk their lives, he knew he could not stop these men.

“Let’s go!” Diao Dedu and the others smiled, rushing into the black hole.

“Buzz…” After they entered the black hole, it rapidly sealed itself and vanished into the starry sky. The stars returned to calm, as if nothing had happened.

A wave of energy passed through Luo Tian’s body. His vision turned pitch black, as if his spirit had been sealed and could not spread outward.

Cold air enveloped him. The surroundings turned silent, devoid of Diao Dedu and Run Hongyu’s presence, causing Luo Tian to feel restless.

Time passed. After an unknown duration, his vision brightened. His body crashed onto the ground with a thud.

“Boom…” A dull sound echoed beneath his feet. At the same time, clouds of white dust rose, choking Luo Tian into coughing.

“Cough… Cough…” After a few coughs, his gaze swiftly surveyed the surroundings, eyes filled with caution.

His gaze then widened in awe, his breath catching as he beheld the scene before him.

A sea of white—everywhere were bones, as if the entire land was forged from bones. A cold atmosphere permeated the air, even making Luo Tian shiver.

“Rustle… Rustle…” Wind blew, causing the bone-trees to sway before his eyes.

“This is the Bone Forest! Where are Diao Dedu and the others?” Luo Tian waved his hand, retrieving a token to attempt contacting them. Yet as expected, he could not connect.

“How many people must have died to form this?” His face turned awestruck, gazing at the endless Bone Forest.

“Crack…” As he stepped down, bones beneath his feet shattered. His brows furrowed slightly.

“Supreme Realm bones?” Luo Tian’s gaze held confusion as he picked up a bone from the ground, quickly discerning its former strength.

Nine Desolate Realms had existed for a long time. Supreme Realm bones, though extraordinary, would erode over time. Yet these bones, despite losing some divine essence, still remained—there must be a special reason.

Luo Tian murmured, his gaze filled with gravity as he stared into the Bone Forest’s depths at the bone-trees.

“If the entrance alone holds Supreme Realm bones, what lies in the Bone Forest’s depths? Could there be an Epoch Lord? Who used such supreme means to preserve these bones against time’s erosion?” Luo Tian murmured.

“To find the White Bone Spirit Bamboo, one must obtain an Epoch Realm bone. I must proceed deeper and locate Diao Dedu and the others quickly; otherwise, misfortune may arise within this desolate place. Moreover, where is the Bone Forest’s exit?” Luo Tian mused before stepping into its depths.

“Crack…” Bones shattered under his feet. Though it was the entrance, he felt no immediate danger but remained cautious, not moving too fast.

“Rustle… Rustle…” Just as Luo Tian had entered the Bone Forest for a quarter of an hour, the bone-trees swayed slowly.

“Boom…” Under Luo Tian’s careful gaze, the trees exploded into dozens of towering bone-figures, each wielding weapons that glowed with dazzling cold light. Luo Tian halted.

The bone-figures seemed mindless, possessing only basic aggression. Yet their numerous towering forms exuded a formidable presence. As these bone-trees coalesced, others also formed, gradually spreading outward.

“Damn it…” Luo Tian felt his scalp tingle. He launched a punch, directly striking a white bone axe.

The thunderous impact echoed. Though the bone axe appeared formidable, Luo Tian’s strength was evident; he could annihilate as many Supreme Realm bones as he wished. Yet what concerned him were the potential Epoch Lord bones in the Bone Forest’s depths—if a few such bones emerged, he would face trouble.

“First deal with these. I wonder how the others fare!” Luo Tian murmured, then continuously struck.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…”

The thunderous sounds echoed as Luo Tian pushed forward into the Bone Forest’s depths. The bones he encountered grew stronger, yet his pace did not slow.

“Supreme… Sage… Early Epoch…” As Luo Tian delved deeper, the bones he met grew stronger. His pace gradually slowed.

Soon, he encountered Epoch Mid Realm bones. Yet there were not many—each bone glowed with divine laws, charging toward him.

“Troublesome,” Luo Tian murmured. He then darted forward, colliding with the nearest bone-figure over a hundred feet tall.

“Rustle…” Even Epoch Mid Realm bones could not withstand Luo Tian’s punch. They shattered under his strike but did not disintegrate, scattering onto the bone ground.

“Again!” Luo Tian roared, continuing toward the next. Yet as he moved, a voice echoed in his mind.

“Damn it! So many Epoch Realm bones!” The voice of the Yin Fish’s spirit echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, filled with excitement.

“What?” Luo Tian’s face bore confusion as he communicated with the Yin Fish spirit, unsure why it reacted so strongly to these bones.

“Release me and have these bones absorbed into the Yin Fish!” The Yin Fish spirit’s voice replied, then explained.

“Do you remember when I used the bone dragon to counter an Epoch Treasure? After that battle, our bones were severely depleted! Now with so many bones, I must replenish them!” The Yin Fish spirit’s voice carried a greedy tone.

“Ah! So that’s why I came here!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed. He recalled how the Yin Fish spirit had once resisted an Epoch Treasure alone, though it later fell into slumber. Now, it could withstand a few strikes without needing to recover.

“Then I’ve come to the right place!” Luo Tian smiled, then waved his hand. The black Yin Fish flew from his grasp.

A black vortex rose above the Yin Fish, a powerful suction pulling toward each bone figure.

“Rustle…” As if encountering an enemy, the bone figures shattered under the suction.

Chapter 1586: The Trace of White Bone Spirit Bamboo

The black vortex hovered, resembling a devouring abyss. Countless bones were absorbed into the Yin Fish, causing Luo Tian to smile.

“This saves me much trouble. It’s also a formidable technique. If I encounter someone with an Epoch Treasure, I can use my Brahman Attack to create an Epoch Treasure and combine it with the Yin Fish’s bone dragon to subdue them!” Luo Tian murmured, sitting on the ground as the Yin Fish absorbed bones.

An hour… two hours. Time passed slowly, with countless Epoch Realm bones entering the Yin Fish.

“Too many! When will this end?” Luo Tian gazed at the endless bones, concern rising. He feared the Yin Fish could not withstand so many.

“Don’t worry, kid. Any Epoch Realm bones I can absorb!” The Yin Fish’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears.

As the Yin Fish absorbed, the entire Bone Forest changed. Those who had entered with Luo Tian—Diao Dedu and others—were also battling formidable bones. Yet as the Yin Fish absorbed, their pressure lessened significantly.

“Hmph…” A moment later, Diao Dedu and others saw the massive black vortex above the Bone Forest. Their faces bore confusion, but it lasted only a moment before they recognized the vortex as belonging to Luo Tian’s Yin Fish.

“It’s Luo Tian!” They then rushed toward the Yin Fish, knowing that in this perilous place, it was better to regroup with Luo Tian.

However, when the Yin Fish had absorbed for nearly an hour, it seemed Luo Tian’s actions triggered some taboo. The bone-trees no longer formed into figures, halting the Yin Fish’s absorption.

“Damn it!” The Yin Fish’s voice echoed with irritation. From within the Yin Fish, a skeletal figure emerged, landing before Luo Tian.

“Kid, you’ve struck gold!” The Yin Fish spirit spoke, its form now a glowing skeleton radiating an aura that even Luo Tian felt startled by.

“What’s wrong?” Luo Tian asked, his face puzzled. He sensed an underlying meaning in the Yin Fish spirit’s words.

“These bones contain some divine laws, though few. Accumulated over time, they can greatly enhance your cultivation!” The Yin Fish’s voice carried a proud tone as it boasted to Luo Tian.

“Really?” Upon hearing the Yin Fish’s words, Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed. If his cultivation could rise again, he would become an Epoch Lord. If he achieved that status, who would he fear? The Reincarnation Body could escape even from an Epoch Lord.

“Kid, don’t get too excited. Becoming an Epoch Lord isn’t just about cultivation; it requires certain timing and location, and one’s own path. Like now, after cultivating the Nine Reincarnation Immortal Bodies, how will you proceed with your cultivation?” The Yin Fish spirit then cast doubt on Luo Tian.

“This…” Upon hearing the Yin Fish spirit’s words, Luo Tian paused slightly before a wry smile formed on his face.

“No!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. Among the current prodigies, the most lacking was experience. Only with sufficient experiences could one grasp their path.

Compared to current prodigies, royal heirs, or Epoch Lords’ offspring, they too lacked such constraints. They had lived long before their slumber and awoke to find the world changed. If they could quickly adapt to this world’s rules, they could enter the Early Epoch Lord status.

“Truly difficult,” Luo Tian observed his nine powerful Reincarnation Immortal Bodies, eyes filled with contemplation. He did not know how to proceed in cultivating these nine bodies, as he had reached a bottleneck. To advance, he must break his current cultivation method.

“Boom… Boom…” Just as Luo Tian was lost in thought, a massive figure approached. With one step, it appeared before him, causing Luo Tian to startle.

“This…?” Luo Tian’s face bore shock as he gazed at the massive figure before him, retreating.

“Boom…” A green bone spike struck the ground where Luo Tian had just vacated.

“Yin Fish Master, you damned thing! Absorb!” Luo Tian then shouted at the Yin Fish hovering in the sky.

“Absorb? This skeleton has several bones of an Epoch Lord. It carries their aura; how can I absorb it, kid? You’ll have to handle this yourself!” The Yin Fish’s form flickered and returned to the Yin Fish, leaving Luo Tian with a grim face.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian cursed under his breath. His form vanished from the spot, then he surveyed the massive figure again.

In an instant, his gaze was drawn to the green bone spike held by the skeletal figure. His face lit up with joy.

“This is the White Bone Spirit Bamboo!” Luo Tian murmured, surprised to have found it so quickly.

“Yet this White Bone Spirit Bamboo clearly lacks vitality; it must have been severed significantly,” Luo Tian then felt disappointment.

“Still, finding its trace means there are living White Bone Spirit Bamboo within the Bone Forest!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with light. He then darted toward the massive skeletal figure.

Though this figure bore several bones of an Epoch Lord, its aura was formidable. Yet it merely posed a challenge for Luo Tian; after all, it wasn’t an Epoch Lord. Even if he faced one directly, he had the confidence to escape.

In a blink, Luo Tian’s form appeared before the massive skeletal figure. His fist, imbued with immense power, struck.

“Crack…” Luo Tian’s fist smashed against the golden-like skeletal body. A crackling sound echoed in his ears.

“Rustle… Rustle…” As Luo Tian collided, segments of bones fell from the massive body. They lost their divine essence. At the same time, the White Bone Spirit Bamboo spike transformed into a strike toward Luo Tian.

“Big fool!” Luo Tian sneered, his feet glowing with light to evade the skeletal figure’s attack.

“Do you think this can harm me?” Luo Tian’s eyes held disdain. He felt no challenge; given time, he could dismantle this giant.

“Boom… Boom…” Yet as Luo Tian’s words ended, a series of booming sounds echoed in his ears. Three massive figures approached from four directions.
