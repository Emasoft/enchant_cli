“Little brat, where do you think you're running?” Chen Zhanbiao roared, his voice echoing like a thunderclap in the ears of all present. He struck Bai Yao across the face with a single, brutal slap.

Chen Zhanbiao's strike was no ordinary blow. His strength was merciless, and the impact nearly severed Bai Yao’s head from his body.

Bai Yao's body was hurled backward, colliding with the two disciples he had brought along. The force sent them flying, crashing violently against the jade-colored walls.

“Elder Brother, he's ours!” Chen Zhanbiao seized Bai Yao as one might grasp a chicken, dragging him before Luotian.

A collective gasp swept through the crowd. One man, Chen Zhanbiao alone, had subdued Bai Yao so effortlessly—what then was Luotian's strength?

Though Bai Yao’s carelessness played a role, it still proved Chen Zhanbiao's formidable power.

“Liangchen, you take the lead!” Luotian addressed Ye Liangchen, raising his hand. A long sword materialized in his grasp. He extended a finger, and streaks of gray qi flared before being etched into the blade as talismanic runes.

“Got it!” Ye Liangchen laughed, snatching the sword and approaching Bai Yao.

"Ye Liangchen! You dare? If you sever my hands, the Medicine King Sect will never forgive you when I return to the Immortal Realm!" Bai Yao stirred, his eyes opening to see the glinting blade and Ye Liangchen's mocking gaze.

*Plop...*

Yet Ye Liangchen ignored Bai Yao’s words. The sword descended, cleaving off both of Bai Yao's hands.

"Ahh..." Pain surged through Bai Yao’s body. Blood spewed forth as his forehead veins throbbed violently. His mind reeled—this pain was not merely physical but seared his soul.

"You..."

"My hands!" Bai Yao's eyes widened in terror, staring at Ye Liangchen. He realized his hands could regrow but would never regain sensation.

"You've crippled me, Ye Liangchen!" Bai Yao's fear deepened. He hadn't anticipated such dire consequences—his soul fragment, it seemed, was sealed.

"Broken... without hands, what's the difference between you and a corpse?" The crowd gasped at Ye Liangchen’s blade.

"Enough. What else do you wish to wager?" Luotian chuckled, still gazing at Bai Yao with no mercy. These two factions were their enemies; if encountered elsewhere, Luotian would have slain them without hesitation.

"Still others are coming. Once they arrive, you may enter the small world. Naturally, our Huanhai Heavenly Palace also has people entering. If anyone harms my people within, don’t blame us for being ruthless!"

Chu Jiuin cast a glance at Bai Yao’s pale face before addressing Luotian's group.

"Others?" The crowd murmured in surprise at Chu Jiuin’s words, unsure who else would arrive.

Chapter 2738: Marriage Arrangement

"Master Chu Jiuin, who is it?" Someone inquired curiously. After all, they were rivals—better to know beforehand.

" They should arrive in a few days. Everyone return to your quarters and rest," Chu Jiuin said nothing more, declaring the banquet ended.

"Let’s go!" Luotian rose, casting a glance at those from Hell and the Immortal Realm before following a water-tribe member to their assigned quarters.

Each was given a room, fully furnished with luxurious extravagance—more opulent than the nine immortal sects of the Immortal Realm, glistening with jewels and splendor.

Luotian sat down, his gaze filled with awe. He felt a quiet tension; soon they would enter the Nine Domains, though he already knew it was gone. Still, it had once been his home.

"Alas..." Luotian sighed deeply, entering meditation to refine himself.

The next morning before dawn, Biao Dezu and Sun Kemin roused Luotian from his meditation with loud shouts.

"What's going on?" Luotian looked at their excited faces, noting that Yao Chen and Sun Kemin were also present.

"Luotian, come see the sunrise! They say Huanhai's sunrise is breathtaking—such a rare sight, we must witness it!" Biao Dezu spoke, surprising Luotian. He hadn’t expected these men to skip sleep for a sunrise.

Luotian adjusted his robes and followed them along the road.

The sky was still dark, yet the streets were already crowded with humanoid figures and bizarre creatures—all members of the water-tribe.

Luotian and his group trailed behind the water-tribe, remaining inconspicuous as they approached the edge of Huanhai Heavenly Palace.

"Are you all so bored?" Luotian's gaze held confusion at their sudden interest in the sunrise.

"You'll understand when we get there!" Sun Kemin's eyes gleamed with mischief. They soon joined the throng of water-tribe members on a vast open platform.

The sky was still dim, but the horizon showed faint light. The time for sunrise was near.

On the platform, men and women stood together, their eyes scanning the crowd as if searching for something. Luotian felt many gazes upon them, scrutinizing him uncomfortably.

"Human?" An old woman approached, accompanied by a young girl with an innocent face.

"Grandma, what's the matter?" Luotian smiled politely. These water-tribe members were formidable; he maintained a courteous expression.

"Good enough, though thin. Still quite handsome!" The old woman nodded, handing Luotian a scale.

"What is this..." Luotian was confused, unsure whether to accept it.

"Grandma, he's here for the sunrise. Give it to me—I'm a great immortal!" Biao Dezu looked at the girl beside the old woman.

"Face reflects the heart. You're too lecherous!" The old woman sneered, retracting her scale and walking away with the girl.

"What's going on?" Luotian turned to his companions, awaiting their explanation.

"Big Brother, I don't know either. I thought we'd get seafood..." Chen Zhanbiao chuckled foolishly.

"It's a marriage arrangement! Every sunrise here hosts matchmaking. Anyone residing in Huanhai Heavenly Palace may participate..."

"Upon arriving, the women each carry a scale. If they favor a man, they give him the scale. If he reciprocates, he accepts it; if not, it's a rejection!" Biao Dezu explained, his eyes darting around.

"Uh..." Luotian was taken aback. These men had come for this?

"It's really..." Luotian felt speechless, knowing his family would skin him if they saw this.

"I'll just leave," Luotian sighed, intending to escape before trouble arose.

"Luotian, where are you going?" Biao Dezu instantly pulled him back, unwilling to let him go.

"What's it to you?" Luotian glanced at Biao Dezu, puzzled by his insistence.

"Look at them. Do they look like men who could find a wife?" Biao Dezu gestured toward his companions.

"Ah..." Luotian hesitated. Their strength was undeniable, but their appearances were indeed lacking.

Biao Dezu was thin and sly; Yao Chen was covered in fur; Sun Kemin was rotund like a ball; Chen Zhanbiao stood as tall as a tower, while Wan Lingkong looked relatively normal.

"I must admit, you're slightly more handsome than me. So we two will use our legendary beauty to attract women, helping these others find partners," Biao Dezu said, arms crossed.

"Have you no shame!"

"Just that..." Upon hearing Biao Dezu's words, the others erupted in protest.

"You're lowering our overall looks..." Sun Kemin pouted, his fat jiggling with every word.

"Little brother, I think you're quite nice. Take this scale!" As they bickered, another woman approached with a girl in her twenties.

"Ah?" The group's eyes brightened at the sight of the woman beside her, her face flushed like a ripe apple.

"Sure thing!" Wan Lingkong laughed, snatching the scale. At least it was a start.

"Thank you, Uncle! I'll entrust my mother to your care!" The girl beamed at Wan Lingkong.

"What?"

"Uncle? Your mother?" Hearing the girl's words, Wan Lingkong stared at her in bewilderment.

"Little brother, let's take a walk over there!" The woman smiled and pulled Wan Lingkong away.

"I refuse! I'm not going!"

"Once you accept the scale, you must stay with me today. It's a rule! Don’t worry—let’s build some feelings first..." Wan Lingkong was dragged into the crowd, vanishing from Luotian's sight.

"Brother, good luck..." Biao Dezu sighed, secretly wondering if he truly looked that old.

The platform erupted in chaos—some joyful, others sorrowful. Couples formed everywhere.

Biao Dezu and the others wandered through the crowd, seeking their ideal matches. To Luotian's surprise, he spotted several Hell and Immortal Realm prodigies among the crowd.

"Why did you spread your immortal king aura? You must have had many coming to you. Why drag me into it?" Luotian was exasperated, as several had already offered scales to them.

"Come on, Big Brother, let's go. I'll treat you to seafood..." Chen Zhanbiao also felt bored.

"I want true love!" Biao Dezu declared loudly, his eyes resolute.

"Miss Liu is here!" As the chaos continued, a shout echoed through the platform, silencing it instantly.

Chapter 2739: Liu Ruyan

As the voice faded, people erupted into chaos, all eyes turning to the source.

Liu Ruyan, one of Huanhai Heavenly Palace's three masters, granddaughter of Liu Xuantian. Her talent was extraordinary; she had reached the immortal king realm. Yet, her only problem was finding a spouse. Master Chu Jiuin had no descendants, and the other master, Su Yuquan, was already married. They grew up together, with Su Yuquan always treating Liu Ruyan as a sister. Others didn’t interest her, so she remained unmatched.

The crowd parted, revealing a figure—slim and elegant, draped in gossamer robes that seemed to swirl like smoke. She appeared ethereal.

The water-tribe members were instantly entranced; even Biao Dezu and Sun Kemin's eyes shifted.

Her emerald eyes surveyed the crowd, her delicate brows furrowed. She stepped forward, becoming the center of attention.

Luotian was stunned; this woman truly embodied beauty beyond compare, rivaling Jiang Sisi and Gu Qiansnow.

Her name suited her—ethereal, untouched by worldly matters. The other women lowered their heads, feeling inferior.

Red light illuminated the scene, the crimson sun rising slowly over the horizon. The red glow surged through the dark night.

Under this light, Liu Ruyan seemed to step out of a painting, her presence elusive and dreamlike. People fell silent, unwilling to break the moment.

As the sun rose, Liu Ruyan reached the front of the crowd. Her gaze swept over everyone.

"Truly beautiful!"

At this moment, an unsuitable voice broke the silence. Everyone turned, angry eyes fixed on the speaker—Liu Ruyan too.

"Sorry..." Luotian felt awkward. He had merely observed Liu Ruyan before turning to the sunrise; his main goal was to witness it.

Luotian was deeply moved, feeling the sun seemed close enough to touch. This sensation was extraordinary, so he let out a sigh.

Liu Ruyan glanced at Luotian, her eyes showing disdain. She suspected he sought attention.

"Damn it! You're dead, Luotian!" Biao Dezu and the others turned pale. Without hesitation, they kicked Luotian out of the crowd.

"You bastard! You're the one who brought me here!" Luotian cursed, pushing back in anger.

"Miss Liu, I am from the Ghost King Sect. My name is Gui Ming. I wish to invite you to witness the sunrise. Do you have time?" A gravelly voice spoke, drawing everyone's attention to Gui Ming.

"Ghost King Sect?" Upon hearing this, people instinctively shivered. Gui Ming's aura was uncomfortable.

"What state is the Immortal Realm in? What right do you have?" Before Liu Ruyan could respond, a voice of disdain echoed. A figure stepped forward beside Liu Ruyan.

Tall and imposing, clad in black robes with a sword on his back. His handsome face was unmistakable—Yeqiu.

Yeqiu's good looks were undeniable, a classic that appealed to all ages. From the start, many women had offered scales to him.

"Merely a pretty face!" Biao Dezu and Sun Kemin sneered, their words clearly laced with envy.

"Liu Ruyan, I am from the Eastern Emperor Sect... I am from..." Yeqiu's words were cut short as Hell and Immortal Realm prodigies stepped forward, their eyes filled with admiration for Liu Ruyan.

"These people are after Liu Ruyan? After all, she is Liu Xuantian's granddaughter. If she marries into a faction, Huanhai Heavenly Palace may favor that group!" Luotian instantly understood the prodigies' intentions.

"These people are among the best of Hell and the Immortal Realm. If you don’t choose them, only your great brother could match you! Ha!" A loud laugh echoed. A young man stepped forward.

"Respect the prodigy!" A chorus of respectful voices arose. This person's arrival instantly drew reverence.

Su Yuquan, Huanhai Heavenly Palace's prodigy, with the strength of an immortal king in his prime. He was the next generation’s strongest and future master of Huanhai Heavenly Palace.

"Brother, you came!" Liu Ruyan spoke for the first time, her voice soft and tender. The crowd felt a shiver; merely hearing her voice was enough to imagine this woman's gentle nature.

"Ah, it's Su Xiong!" Upon seeing Su Yuquan, Yeqiu and Gui Ming smiled warmly.

"Everyone, my sister is delicate but precious to Huanhai Heavenly Palace. If anyone wishes to marry her, they must first pass my test!" Su Yuquan smiled, addressing the crowd.

"No need. Brother, I've already chosen someone!" Before Su Yuquan's words ended, Liu Ruyan’s soft voice echoed. The crowd was taken aback.

"Ah?" Su Yuquan was surprised Liu Ruyan had chosen so quickly.

"Who? Who?" Su Yuquan looked at the crowd. His sister was notoriously picky; she had found someone she liked.

As Su Yuquan shouted, Liu Ruyan walked forward gracefully through the crowd. The prodigies also straightened their postures.

Under everyone's gaze, Liu Ruyan passed each prodigy, walking toward Luotian’s group.

"Damn it! Why him?" The prodigies' eyes burned with jealousy. If Huanhai Heavenly Palace allied with Tianyuan Sect, it would be harder to take it down.

"Still good. I must admit, this kid is stronger than me!" Su Yuquan sighed inwardly. He had heard of Luotian's deeds.

"Miss, you've made a mistake. I am already married!" Luotian looked at Liu Ruyan, his face grimacing.

But before he finished speaking, Luotian's face turned red. Liu Ruyan had bypassed him and approached Biao Dezu.

"Miss, you have good taste!"

"But I am low-key!" Biao Dezu's eyes gleamed. He crossed his arms, pretending to be cool. Before he finished speaking, Liu Ruyan moved on, leaving a trail of fragrance.

"Here you go!" Finally, Liu Ruyan stopped before Yao Chen, handing him a golden scale.

Chapter 2740: All Gathered

"Yao Chen?" The crowd's faces showed disbelief.

A cacophony erupted. People cried out, shouting, making Su Yuquan frown.

"What are you all yelling about?" Su Yuquan roared, his voice impatient. Though surprised, he said nothing—Liu Ruyan had chosen, and he would ensure she wasn’t harmed.

Yet Su Yuquan glanced at Yao Chen, sighing inwardly. This man was clearly no pushover; his strength in the immortal king’s late stage surpassed Su Yuquan, causing him a sense of defeat.

Who was Su Yuquan? The future master of Huanhai Heavenly Palace, known as invincible among peers in the same realm. Even these Immortal Realm prodigies, Su Yuquan was confident he could defeat them in water.

"Miss, have you chosen the wrong person? Your eyes aren’t good!" Biao Dezu and Sun Kemin asked.

"Damn it, I lost to a monkey!" They cursed inwardly but dared not speak out—otherwise Yao Chen might beat them.

"Miss, you should choose someone else. I don’t have the heart for it yet..." Yao Chen spoke softly. He had never thought about women; battle was his passion. He believed women were troublesome, affecting his combat strength.

"What? I didn’t hear that right!" The crowd erupted again, their eyes filled with disbelief.

"Brother, you’ve caused trouble!" Luotian stepped back from Yao Chen, addressing him.

This situation was familiar to Luotian. He had once experienced the terrifying zeal of these obsessed pursuers in the Star Moon Divine Clan’s Rotating Hall.

"Things, we like this one!" The Huanhai Heavenly Palace crowd immediately shouted, surrounding Yao Chen.

"Hey, listen to me! This monkey is mischievous. Don’t believe his lies. Actually, I’m a monkey too!" Biao Dezu shouted, emitting waves of energy and transforming into Yao Chen’s appearance—no flaws anywhere.

"Miss Liu, I didn’t expect you to like this type!" Biao Dezu addressed Liu Ruyan but noticed her eyes remained on Yao Chen.

"Go away..." Liu Ruyan’s gaze turned cold, looking at Biao Dezu.

"You’re insulting who?" Yao Chen roared, also gazing at Liu Ruyan. To him, Biao Dezu was closer than this woman—after years of brotherhood.

"You..." Liu Ruyan’s eyes showed委屈, tears welling up. Her gaze at Yao Chen made people feel pity.

"Yao Chen!" Su Yuquan’s eyes flashed anger, shouting. A spring sound echoed as he drew his sword from his back.

"Things!" Many water-tribe members became angry, glaring at Yao Chen. Some even rubbed their fists, ready to teach this insolent monkey a lesson.

"Want to fight?"

"I’ll seal my strength and fight you. Whoever wins can do as they please!" Yao Chen shook his staff, looking at Su Yuquan with disdain.

"Fight then! I’m not afraid of you!" Su Yuquan responded strongly. In Huanhai Heavenly Palace, he didn’t believe anyone could bully him.

"Good, Luotian help me seal my strength!" Yao Chen’s eyes burned with battle spirit. He addressed Luotian.

"Uh..." Luotian was stunned, looking at the hostile water-tribe members. He felt Yao Chen was playing with fire.

"Monkey Brother, calm down! Calm down..." Biao Dezu and the others rushed to comfort Yao Chen and Su Yuquan.

"Wait!" As the atmosphere grew tense, Liu Ruyan spoke, drawing everyone's attention.

"You said if I defeat you, I can do as I please?" Liu Ruyan smiled, gazing at Yao Chen.

"Of course!" Yao Chen coldly replied. He was confident he could subdue everything.

"Good, then dare to fight me one-on-one?"

"Of course I won’t fear you!"

"Follow me!" They quickly exchanged words. Once they finished, Liu Ruyan had already left the platform with Yao Chen.

"What’s going on? I’m confused!" Everyone stared at the two leaving, even Su Yuquan didn’t know what Liu Ruyan was up to.

"Let’s not interfere. When fate comes, let it be natural!" Luotian also felt confused, watching them leave.

"Continue, continue!" Su Yuquan shouted. He knew Yao Chen wouldn’t harm Liu Ruyan.

As Su Yuquan spoke, people resumed their chaos, seeking their targets and continuing the matchmaking.

"Let’s go. There's nothing more to see!" Luotian said, walking back to his quarters. He believed Yao Chen would be fine.

Biao Dezu and Sun Kemin, however, stayed behind, continuing to seek their targets.

Luotian returned to his quarters and sat in meditation, adjusting his state. After all, the aftereffects of his Heavenly Demon Dissolution hadn’t fully healed.

Three hours passed. Sun Kemin and Biao Dezu returned with drooping heads, muttering, clearly unsuccessful.

"Alas, people now care too much about appearances."

"Yes, yes. The monkey truly got lucky!" They muttered, their voices filled with anger.

"Everyone, you're all gathered. You may enter the small world at noon today!" As they muttered, Chu Jiuin's voice echoed in their ears. Luotian and Biao Dezu’s eyes became solemn as they left the room.

They walked toward the central hall. Upon reaching the palace doors, they met the Hell and Immortal Realm prodigies. They exchanged glances, eyes filled with vigilance—soon they would have a battle.

Inside the hall, Chu Jiuin sat there. To his left sat a man in green robes, his attire shimmering with divine laws—clearly no ordinary person.

"Zhou Zhiwen?" Luotian’s eyes flickered. The man seated there was the current chairman of Zhongtian Commercial Association, Zhou Zhiwen.

"Who is it? A merchant! This scum deserves our contempt!" Seeing Zhou Zhiwen, the Immortal Sect prodigies sneered.

"Ah, it's been a while. I apologize for the delay. Please forgive me!" Zhou Zhiwen smiled, as if he hadn’t heard their words, addressing the crowd.

"Brother Zhou, it's been a while!" Luotian bowed to Zhou Zhiwen. He knew Zhongtian Commercial Association's strength was no less than any Immortal Sect.

Chapter 2741: Returning to the Nine Domains

On the endless ocean, several figures stood there—Hell and Immortal Realm representatives alongside Luotian’s group. All eyes gazed at the vast spatial rift.

A barrier blocked the rift. Chu Jiuin stood beneath it, gazing at Luotian’s group: "Everyone, are you ready?"

"Nothing's wrong. Please, Master, open the barrier!" They all shouted, eyes filled with excitement. After waiting so many days, the barrier was finally open. Though enemies awaited inside, they saw it as normal.

A dozen people represented the Immortal Realm, Hell, and all of Huanhai Heavenly Palace's young powerhouses. They knew that entering the small world, only Huanhai Heavenly Palace members could not be harmed; others were their enemies.

"Good for you, Monkey Brother!" Biao Dezu and the others wore envious expressions, watching Yao Chen standing there, clearly distressed.

Yao Chen stood beside Liu Ruyan. His face was grim, but recalling his earlier words, he allowed Liu Ruyan to drape her arm over his. Others' jealousy flared.

Biao Dezu and the others understood, believing Yao Chen wouldn’t lose to Liu Ruyan—likely he had intentionally lost.

"Get out!" Yao Chen roared, knowing what they thought. He kicked Sun Kemin and Biao Dezu away.

"Open!" As they spoke, Chu Jiuin’s hands moved, etching divine laws onto the barrier.

The barrier cracked along the divine law chains. Vast void energy surged out, scattering over Luotian’s group.

"This is for you. Through this scale, you can find the nodes here; otherwise, it's hard to locate other positions!" Chu Jiuin addressed Luotian’s group. Several golden lights fell before them—golden scales.

"Thank you, Master!" Luotian’s group bowed. They gazed at each other and, in unison, leapt into the spatial rift.

"Haha! I'm going first!" Biao Dezu moved like lightning, instantly vanishing into the rift.

"Fast!" Wang Xiu followed closely, his eyes shocked at Biao Dezu's speed. He too vanished into the rift.

Within five breaths, Luotian’s group rushed into the spatial rift, vanishing from Chu Jiuin's sight.

"Who will obtain the World Heart this time? Let our two little kids try their best!" Chu Jiuin muttered, sitting on the sea surface in meditation, waiting for Luotian’s return.

Luotian rushed into the void. The fragile spatial rifts shattered before him, and he instantly burst through, appearing beneath the vast starry sky.

Upon entering space, Luotian's eyes moistened. A familiar aura enveloped him.

"Nine Domains!" Luotian gazed around, a repelling force acting on his body but very weak. He felt if he were stronger, this force would push him out.

Looking at the shattered starry sky, no continent remained. The entire space still carried a bloodstained scent, with chaotic debris floating beneath it.

"Luotian!" Biao Dezu and the others appeared beside him, their eyes filled with sorrow. Seeing their homeland in this state, no one felt good.

"This must be the Mortal Domain!" Biao Dezu sighed. Though broken, the small world's aura still existed.

They could feel their strength within the small world—plucking stars, toppling continents. Yet now it was just debris without the former Mortal Domain's power. Luotian and his group walked through space, recalling memories of the Nine Domains. Meanwhile, the prodigies had split into two groups upon entry, searching for the World Heart.

"Nothing left..." They whispered softly, walking through the Nine Domains. Even several deadly places had vanished. The starry realm was unusually quiet. They walked through space for a day, finally emerging from their sorrow and spotting a black hole beneath the stars. It radiated waves, distorting space. Golden divine laws flowed within it.

"World Heart truly exists!" Upon seeing the black hole, they confirmed. The golden divine laws were unmistakably World Power.

Though the black hole seemed near, it gave Luotian's group a distant feeling. Several figures appeared in their sight, causing them to glare coldly.

"Hell's prodigies!" Luotian’s eyes showed a slight smile. He had expected this so soon.

"Let's go, kill them!" Luotian spoke, his spear in hand. Without hesitation, he rushed toward the ghostly figures.

From the start, Luotian hadn’t intended for these people to leave this small world alive. Kill one at a time—Tianyuan Sect's debt would be repaid with blood.

"Luotian!" Upon seeing the Hell prodigies, they also spotted Luotian’s group and shouted.

"Kill!" The Hell people shouted. Luotian's group charged forward, their faces darkened with anger. Memories of Hell’s army storming Tianyuan Mountain flashed through their minds.

Their killing intent was fierce, toppling space. Several attacks directly targeted the Hell people, making Yeqiu’s group grimace.

"Think you can beat us? Here, everyone is an immortal king in the middle stage. What can you do?" The Hell prodigies shouted.

*Boom...*

The glinting spear tip clashed with the white sword. Yeqiu's face paled, his body flying tens of thousands of feet before stopping.

Yao Chen radiated golden light, swinging his staff. He crushed Wang Xiu, who was thrown back and spat blood.

Chen Zhanbiao resembled a human beast. He punched, though both he and Yao Chen had sealed their strength at the immortal king's middle stage. Their power was still formidable.

"Come on, come on!" Biao Dezu, Sun Kemin, and Wan Lingkong didn’t attack but shouted constantly. Their eyes were cold—should anyone escape, they would combine forces to deliver a fatal blow.

A默契 formed. In one round of attacks from Luotian’s three, the Hell prodigies were crushed.

"Luotian, don’t push us!" The prodigies shouted. But they received Luotian’s group's relentless attacks.

Chapter 2742: Starstone

In the starry domain, space kept breaking. Luotian, Chen Zhanbiao, and Yao Chen continuously attacked the Hell prodigies. Though only three of them, they had the Hell prodigies at their mercy, leaving them in despair.

"How can you be so strong? They are all immortal king middle stage!" Their hearts were shocked. Though they had them at their mercy, killing them would take time.

*Boom...*

They tried to break free together but were denied by Biao Dezu, Sun Kemin, and Wan Lingkong.

"This is a plan to exhaust us!" The Hell prodigies felt anxious, their injuries worsening.

They had come here with resources. Hell provided some life-saving methods, but they were selfish—waiting for others to use first.

This mindset made their injuries worse. They were in a pitiful state. Luotian, though unwell, still had his strength. He unleashed the Six Paths Reincarnation Fist, sending Yeqiu flying and then grabbed a black ghost claw with his other hand. The claw exploded space, attacking another prodigy, Wu Xingwen.

Wu Xingwen's clothes were torn. He looked like a beggar. Every attack from Luotian left him struggling, even with Yeqiu's help. Seeing the black ghost claw, Wu Xingwen spat out a silver dragon that wrapped around it.

*Boom...*

The runes shattered. The black ghost claw was weakened but still struck Wu Xingwen, eventually breaking.

Blood spewed. Wu Xingwen's face was pale. After so long, his strength had declined significantly. He could no longer withstand Luotian's Hell Ghost Claw.

"Damn it! Do I have to use my life-saving item? If I do now, I can't compete for the World Heart!" Wu Xingwen cursed inwardly. But others weren’t in good shape either—no one had the resources to help him.

"Still thinking of other things?" A cold voice echoed in Wu Xingwen's ear, making him shiver. Without thinking, he turned and slapped a palm.

*Plop...*

A searing pain nearly knocked Wu Xingwen out. A black spear pierced his palm, exiting through his shoulder. Blood dripped from the spear tip.

"Ahh..." Wu Xingwen screamed, but then reacted. A star knife appeared and cut his arm. He stepped through space to ten thousand feet away.
