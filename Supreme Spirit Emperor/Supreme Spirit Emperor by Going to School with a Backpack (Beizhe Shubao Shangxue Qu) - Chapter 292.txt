“Boy, you’ve reached the Supreme Realm without even telling us!” The giants of the Stone Village, their faces alight with joy, gathered around Chu Chen. They pounded his shoulders with massive hands.

“Ha! Our Stone Village has produced a Supreme Realm cultivator!” The villagers laughed heartily, surrounding Chu Chen.

“I didn’t know myself—I just felt stronger now. My appetite’s grown too!” Chu Chen chuckled, clapping fists with the villagers.

“But what about this little one?” After a ruckus, the giants turned their gaze to the fallen figure.

“Alas, he must be pitiable. His tiny size—no doubt he’s suffered much,” a boy with a fierce face said, his eyes softening.

“Never mind. I’ll take him home. He probably doesn’t eat much anyway,” Chu Chen sighed, patting the small figure to rouse him.

“The Tribal Leader is in seclusion. Otherwise, he might know why this little one’s so small,” the villagers said, admiration in their eyes.

“Cough…!” As they spoke, a soft cough echoed from beneath Chu Chen’s hand. The villagers turned their eyes to the small figure.

“Awake?” The villagers’ faces lit with curiosity, gathering around the tiny form.

“What place is this?” Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, confusion in his gaze. His vision was hazy, scanning the surroundings before flashes of unclear images flickered through his mind—each one indistinct, and each attempt to grasp them brought a searing headache.

“Ah…!” Under the gaze of the massive tribesmen, Luo Tian clutched his head in a wail, his eyes filled with pain.

“Who am I?” Luo Tian extended his hands, gazing at himself and the towering tribesmen around him. He spoke softly.

“You don’t know who you are?” Chu Chen’s face mirrored confusion, his voice gruff. Luo Tian’s expression turned puzzled.

“Don’t know!” Luo Tian shook his head, the unfamiliar environment making his eyes flicker.

“Ugh, we’ve picked up another amnesiac dwarf. Doesn’t know his own name!” The villagers shook their heads.

“Never mind. Since you don’t remember, take my surname—Chu!” Chu Chen chuckled, not intending to send Luo Tian away. If he did, he knew the dwarf would surely perish in the Southern Ridge’s dangers. The beasts there were ruthless; Luo Tian’s frail form was weaker than even the village children.

“Pity,” the villagers, simple-hearted, sighed at Luo Tian’s bewildered eyes.

“Chu Chen said you fell from the sky. How about… ‘Chu Drop’? What do you think?” A fierce-faced giant boy approached the dwarf, gently patting his shoulder, fearing he might shatter him.

“Pfft… Get lost, Er Gou. What kind of name is that!” A middle-aged man kicked the boy.

“Chu Tian! Let’s call him ‘Chu Tian’!” Chu Chen smiled, addressing the dwarf. He felt his chosen name was bold and fitting.

“Chu Tian… Tian!” Luo Tian’s eyes were confused, his mind swirling with thoughts. A woman’s voice echoed in his mind.

“Luo Tian!” Calls repeated, and Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with confusion. He whispered, “Luo Tian! I think my name is Luo Tian!”

“Luo Tian?” The villagers murmured, their voices reaching Luo Tian’s ears, deepening his sense of familiarity.

“Yes! I think that’s my name!” Luo Tian spoke, his voice carrying a hint of certainty.

“Good. Let it be Luo Tian. Since you’ve remembered your name, what else have you recalled? Like where you’re from?” Chu Chen asked, his eyes filled with hope. He felt the dwarf was strange.

“Nothing,” Luo Tian shook his head again, his mind still blank.

“Come on. From now on, this Stone Village is your home. Don’t worry—no one will bully you here!” Chu Chen didn’t wait for Luo Tian’s response, grabbing him and lifting him onto his shoulder. He headed toward his dwelling.

Luo Tian sat on Chu Chen’s shoulder, letting the giant carry him. Soon they arrived at a stone hut. Compared to Chu Chen’s massive frame, the hut was small—but to Luo Tian, it seemed immense.

The hut contained nothing but stones and beast bones. Luo Tian felt uneasy, as if he’d never been here before.

“Alright, stay here and think. Later tonight we’ll eat together—join us!” Chu Chen smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

“Okay,” Luo Tian said, his eyes still confused. He sat on a solid chair—though it could double as a bed.

“Have you cultivated before? Want me to teach you my method? Since you’re staying here, it’s good to train. Even if you leave later, being stronger will keep you safer!” Chu Chen was enthusiastic.

“Cultivate?” Luo Tian’s face furrowed again, a sense of familiarity. He nodded slowly and sighed.

“Then I’ll teach you!” Chu Chen didn’t hesitate, passing his cultivation method to Luo Tian. It was the one given by the Lord of Qinghe City, not a high-level technique but far from inferior.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, following Chu Chen’s method. He sat cross-legged on the chair-like stone seat and began cultivating.

Cultivation energy flowed gently through Luo Tian, entering his body and moving along the meridians.

Time passed. After two hours, Luo Tian struggled to complete a single circuit, but no energy fluctuations were felt in his body.

“Alas,” Chu Chen observed Luo Tian’s progress, disappointment flickering across his face. In his view, this Luo Tian had poor talent. Even the village children, after learning Chu Chen’s method, performed better in both timing and energy retention.

Though the tribesmen relied on their bodies for combat, cultivating to refine their flesh was one of their methods to enhance strength.

“Come on. You’re hungry, right?” Chu Chen said, joyous. He lifted Luo Tian onto his shoulder again—displeased with the dwarf’s short legs, which moved too slowly. If they were late, the village children would have devoured all the food.

Chu Chen strode forward. Soon they reached the dining area of the Stone Village, where over two hundred people sat in groups.

Massive stone cauldrons stood there, their surfaces etched with intricate and ancient patterns, showing their age. Steam rose from the cauldrons, as if growling. Blocks of unknown beast flesh boiled within, radiating a powerful aura.

The village children clustered around the cauldrons, drooling as they waited for adults to serve the meat.

“Today was lucky. We caught two Flame-Wolf and a Thunder-Beast!” A middle-aged giant spoke to Chu Chen.

“Unfortunately, I did catch a Flying Dragon. If I brought it back, the children would’ve gained much!” Chu Chen sighed at Luo Tian, a hint of helplessness in his eyes.

“Enough. Today’s a big day! Chu Chen, since you’ve reached the Supreme Realm, let’s get drunk!” The villagers gathered around Chu Chen, congratulating him.

“Ha! Definitely!” Chu Chen laughed, chatting with the villagers.

“Dinner’s ready!” The giant in charge of the cauldrons called, distributing wolf and lion meat to everyone.

“Thank the Divine Beast for our food!” The villagers spoke with reverence, their voices devout.

“Let’s eat!” The giants and children shouted, rushing for the food, devouring it hungrily.

“Eat!” Chu Chen, while clinking drinks with the villagers, also handed a large piece of wolf meat to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian smiled slightly, biting into the meat. He chewed twice and swallowed.

“Buzz…” As he ingested the wolf meat, Luo Tian felt an overwhelming sense of comfort. His pores seemed to expand.

“Little ones, go!” A group of adults lifted the children and tossed them into the cauldrons.

“Don’t run!” Cries echoed as the children were thrown in, their voices rising.

Chapter 1217: Herbal Soak

In the Stone Village of the Southern Ridge, fires flickered. The faces of tribesmen—old and young, men and women—were lit with smiles. Life in the Southern Ridge was simple; they were content with food and drink.

“Er Gou, don’t run. You don’t know how lucky you are. My own father couldn’t get this!” A middle-aged giant chased his children, tossing them into the cauldron.

The children resisted but were overpowered. All were eventually thrown into the cauldrons, yelling and screaming.

“Run what? This is to refine your bones. It’ll make you stronger tomorrow!” Elders smiled, scattering around the cauldrons, tossing herbs into the great pots. The aroma of medicine filled the air.

After adding herbs, several elders took out stone jars. Roars echoed from within them, fierce energy radiating.

“Hmph. No wonder the Thunder-Beast and Flame-Wolf are so strong. Their essence is so powerful!” Elders smiled, adding the essence to the cauldron.

“Ah… it hurts…” The children cried out as their bodies glowed, the medicinal essence and diluted beast essence seeping into their skin through open pores.

“This is our village’s ancient method to refine the body. It works for both adults and children,” an elder explained.

“Brother, want to try? This is great for strengthening your body!” Chu Chen approached Luo Tian, who remained confused. “Only children can use it here. Since you’re so small, I’ll let you try.”

“Okay,” Luo Tian nodded gently. He had forgotten everything since awakening, so he wanted to try anything to recall something.

“Plop…” Seeing Luo Tian’s nod, Chu Chen didn’t hesitate. He tossed him into the nearest cauldron. Though it was a stone pot, Luo Tian’s small body could swim laps within.

Unluckily, two other tiny giants were already in the cauldron. As Luo Tian entered, he was overturned.

“Cough…!” Immediately after entering, Luo Tian inhaled some medicinal liquid, which was forced into his stomach.

“Ha! Brother, it’s fine. The more you drink, the better for you!” Chu Chen smiled.

But Luo Tian’s face turned red. Due to eating Flame-Wolf meat, his pores were open, and the powerful medicinal essence flooded into his body.

“Hmm…” Luo Tian found it strange. He felt no pain like the other children, but instead a profound sense of comfort. A ball of energy seemed to refine the massive medicinal essence within him, gathering in his dantian. That dantian felt like an endless abyss.

The medicinal liquid Luo Tian accidentally swallowed wandered through his meridians, nourishing them.

“Gurgle…” Luo Tian felt this sensation was familiar. He had no reason to believe it was harmful, so he continued swallowing the liquid.

“Buzz…” Unwillingly, Luo Tian’s body seemed like an endless abyss. No matter how much he devoured the medicinal liquid, it was continuously refined through his meridians. The massive energy transformed into pure liquid, sinking into his dantian.

The water vapor from the medicinal liquid was constantly evaporated by Luo Tian, causing steam to rise from the cauldron.

As Luo Tian devoured more, a small vortex formed beside him. Soon, he didn’t need to consume it; the medicinal liquid in the cauldron dropped at a terrifying speed.

“What’s going on?” The villagers’ faces showed shock, watching the steam rising from Luo Tian’s cauldron. In a blink, it had dropped halfway.

“Even Chu Chen didn’t experience this when he first took the herbal soak. How could such a small body absorb so much energy?” The villagers murmured.

After discussing for a while, the entire cauldron’s medicinal essence was absorbed by Luo Tian in an astonishing speed.

“Chu Chen, did you pick up a monster?” The villagers were stunned by Luo Tian’s terrifying absorption speed.

“Ha! I really have extraordinary talent!” Two giant children stood up, laughing loudly.

“Idiot, it’s not your business. I’ll get you another cauldron next time!” An adult pulled the two children out of the cauldron.

Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, a sense of relief spreading through his body. He let out a soft moan.

“Brother, you did well!” Chu Chen pulled Luo Tian from the cauldron, examining him. He was curious how such a small body could absorb so much energy.

“Can I try another one?” Luo Tian pointed to the nearest cauldron, his face thoughtful. He felt a golden light flickering in his dantian, each droplet radiating immense power. Yet he didn’t know how to summon it.

“What? Brother, take it easy. It could kill you!” Chu Chen shook his head, objecting.

“I feel I need this,” Luo Tian sighed longingly. He felt his body held countless mysteries, needing exploration and revelation.

“Okay,” Chu Chen nodded gently after seeing the longing in Luo Tian’s eyes. He placed him into another cauldron, removing the children inside. After all, those kids wouldn’t absorb much medicinal essence anyway.

“Plop…” Luo Tian jumped into the cauldron himself, his body once again acting like an endless abyss, consuming and refining massive medicinal liquid.

This time, the speed was even more terrifying. In a moment, Luo Tian had devoured the entire cauldron’s contents, stunning the villagers.

“Is he human?” Someone asked, wide-eyed at Luo Tian stepping out of the cauldron.

“I need more! This isn’t enough!” Luo Tian spoke, gazing at Chu Chen with a hint of desire.

“Okay, I won’t back down!” Chu Chen nodded, immediately bringing out several more cauldrons for Luo Tian to absorb.

“One… two…” In an hour, under the villagers’ stunned gazes, Luo Tian had devoured several cauldrons of medicinal essence.

“Buzz…” A surge of radiant light spread from Luo Tian, his body radiating a powerful aura. He sat cross-legged in the cauldron, like a seated monarch. Though small, he appeared unusually tall to the tribesmen.

“Any more?” Luo Tian stood up slowly, his aura vanishing instantly.

Hearing this, the villagers snapped out of their trance. Seeing Luo Tian return to his previous state, they shook their heads.

“None left!” Chu Chen quickly shook his head, not wanting Luo Tian to continue. He realized he had found a bottomless pit.

“Hmm,” Luo Tian smiled slightly, then returned to confusion, gazing at Chu Chen.

“Brother, how do you feel?” After Luo Tian absorbed the last cauldron’s essence, Chu Chen felt a pressure. Even as a Supreme Realm cultivator, he felt some unease.

“Nothing special. Just feels comfortable!” Luo Tian shook his head with a bitter smile. Though he felt different from before, he didn’t know how. His dantian was warm, as if a golden ocean surged within.

“Alright! Too bad for these cauldrons!” Chu Chen grumbled. These were prepared for the village children, but Luo Tian had ruined them.

“Never mind. There’ll be another chance! Let’s go!” The villagers, understanding and sympathetic to Luo Tian, didn’t scold him too harshly.

They chatted a bit more, discussing where to hunt tomorrow. Then they returned to their stone huts.

Luo Tian followed Chu Chen back to the original hut. Chu Chen slept on a large bed, while Luo Tian lay on a chair, unable to sleep, trying to recall his past.

Unconsciously, Luo Tian fell into a deep sleep. In his dream, he had countless visions—meeting many people and experiencing various things until a thunderclap woke him up, drenched in cold sweat.

“Chu Chen brother, let’s go steal the Purple Lightning Bird’s eggs. I heard they’re delicious!” A thunderous voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, making him sigh.

“Okay,” outside the hut, Chu Chen was worn out by the children’s demands. He reluctantly nodded.

Luo Tian stepped outside, smiling slightly. He thought this life was good.

“Brother Luo, want to come with me?” Chu Chen saw Luo Tian and smiled, addressing him.

“Yeah, I’ll go,” Luo Tian nodded. His eyes were gentle—why he felt so at home in the Stone Village.

The children cheered, following Chu Chen out of the village. Luo Tian was naturally placed on Chu Chen’s shoulder as they walked into the deep mountains of the Southern Ridge.

Chapter 1218: Entering the Southern Ridge

The Southern Ridge was filled with ancient trees. The Stone Village was near its edge, relying on hunting beasts within to survive.

Towering ancient trees spread across the ridge. A few massive figures walked through it—Chu Chen and the village children.

“Brother, this edge is safe. But the deeper parts aren’t. There are beasts with cultivation here. Even I dare not go too deep,” Chu Chen explained as he walked, his shoulder carrying Luo Tian.

“These kids are after the Purple Lightning Bird. It’s one of the top beasts outside this ridge! So we must be careful,” he added.

“Ugh, Er Gou, get off me!” Chu Chen, while explaining, regretted bringing these kids into the Southern Ridge.

As soon as they entered, the boys acted like wild horses, charging ahead without fear. But Chu Chen was puzzled—since entering the ridge, they had seen powerful beasts, yet they all showed fear and fled upon seeing them.

Chu Chen had entered the ridge many times before but never encountered this. This made him cautious, observing carefully and keeping the kids within his sight.

They reached the boundary between the ridge’s edge and depth safely. Trees blocked sunlight, dampness rising beneath their feet. The forest was dark like dusk.

A massive mountain stood before them, its surface smooth, surprising Luo Tian.

“This is the Purple Lightning Bird’s territory. Beyond this mountain lies the ridge’s depths. I once entered and fought a giant ape, but neither could defeat the other,” Chu Chen said, his voice tinged with nostalgia.

“Is that the Purple Lightning Bird’s nest?” Er Gou pointed to a large cave on the mountain wall, overgrown with weeds. Thunderous energy radiated from it.

“Yes. This time is when the Purple Lightning Bird is out foraging. It’s our chance!” Chu Chen smiled, having mastered the bird’s schedule.

“You stay here. I’ll go up and steal the eggs for you. Don’t wander off. The Purple Lightning Bird, though not as strong as that giant ape, is still powerful and fast,” Chu Chen placed Luo Tian on the ground, giving instructions. He then dashed toward the mountain wall.

His massive body soared into the air, his Supreme Realm energy propelling him. Even he took nearly an hour to reach the cave.

He carefully observed around, confirming the Purple Lightning Bird wasn’t inside. Satisfied, he entered the cave.

“Boring!” Er Gou’s face showed boredom, looking around.

“Yes, I thought we’d have to go steal it ourselves. Turns out I just had to wait here!” Other children also showed impatience.

Luo Tian looked around too, then at the cave Chu Chen had entered. For some reason, he seemed to see everything Chu Chen did—his actions were embedded in Luo Tian’s mind.

“Uh-oh!” Luo Tian’s face showed worry, sensing the images in his mind. He spoke softly.

In his mind, Chu Chen’s massive body walked through the cave cautiously. Though confident in his strength, he moved at a moderate pace.

But Luo Tian’s mind showed another scene: deep within the cave, a golden-furred beast held two purple eggs, heading toward the cave’s exit. Their meeting would be imminent.

“What’s wrong? Brother Luo?” The children looked at Luo Tian, puzzled. Though small, his face was that of an adult, so they still called him “brother.”

“Roar!” As Er Gou’s words ended, a deep roar echoed. The entire mountain seemed to tremble.

“Did you meet it?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed urgency, addressing the children: “You must run!”

“Run where? It’s just a fight. Tribesmen don’t back down!” The children showed excitement, gazing at the cliff.

“Boom…” As the children’s words ended, Chu Chen’s figure flew out of the cave. His face showed disbelief.

“Roar…” A massive, mountain-sized body emerged from the cave too. Golden fur covered its entire body. A golden ape chased Chu Chen out of the cave, taller than him by half.

“Run! I’ll come later!” Chu Chen roared, his aura fierce. He charged toward the golden ape.

“Boom…” The collision of fists echoed. The golden ape also swung its fist, clashing with Chu Chen.

“Wow! What is this!” The children were stunned. Terrifying waves overturned many ancient trees, nearly blowing them away. Fortunately, their massive bodies saved them.

“Run! Staying here would only be a burden for Chu Chen!” Luo Tian urged the children to leave.

“Brother Luo, what about you?” The children realized the severity of the situation. They asked as Luo Tian showed no intention to move.

“I have to stay too!” Luo Tian sighed longingly. Because a massive creature was flying toward them.

A call echoed, like a purple lightning bolt, appearing above Luo Tian and the others.

“This is the Purple Lightning Bird. It must have been attracted by Chu Chen’s fight with the ape!” Er Gou and others looked at the bird, fear in their eyes.

At this moment, Chu Chen was occupied with the ape. He couldn’t save them. The Purple Lightning Bird was a dominant force in this ridge’s outskirts. Even Chu Chen would retreat if it confronted him.

“Crack…” Purple lightning interwove with the bird’s feathers. The two eyes of the Purple Lightning Bird glowed coldly, staring at Luo Tian and the others.

Creatures with such strength had intelligence comparable to humans. However, they couldn’t transform in the tribesman’s world. If they could, this bird and the ape would have already transformed.

The Purple Lightning Bird’s eyes flashed with intense anger. Seeing the golden ape fighting Chu Chen, it ignored that battlefield and focused on Luo Tian’s group. It knew they were likely allies.

“I’ll draw it away. You run!” Luo Tian addressed the stunned children, stepping forward and shouting at the bird.

“Beast! You dare chase me!” Luo Tian roared, running toward Chu Chen’s battlefield.

“Crack…” A purple lightning bolt struck Luo Tian’s feet, making him shudder.

“Run!” The children had never seen such a scene. They fled toward the village.

The bird called again, its feathers fully spread. Purple lightning bolts rained from the sky, covering a hundred miles with purple lightning.

The children’s escape speed was fast, but some didn’t fully flee. They were caught in the purple lightning storm, scrambling to protect their heads.

“Damn it! Is this bird crazy!” Chu Chen roared, punching the ape back. He moved swiftly to a child’s side, shielding him from the bird’s lightning.

“You’re not good either. You took my child! Don’t take it out on us!” Chu Chen knew the bird could understand him, shouting at it.

“You’re all no good. Give me back my child!” The bird’s cold voice echoed in Chu Chen’s mind, the lightning intensifying. It turned the entire hundred miles into ruins.

The golden ape was no pushover either. As a ruler of the ridge’s depths, it couldn’t accept being bullied by the bird.

“Little sparrow, are you really going to fight me?” The ape’s deep voice echoed. It spoke in human language.

“My child!” The bird cried, the lightning storm becoming more terrifying. It turned the surroundings into a sea of thunder, impenetrable.

This was the bird’s second egg-laying. The first had been stolen by something unknown, making it furious. Now, another attempt was interrupted—how could it not be enraged?

“Little sparrow, do you think you’re invincible? I’ll give you some respect, but don’t take it for granted!” The ape growled, its foot extended toward the bird.

“Crack…” A thunderous sound echoed. The ape was unmatched in strength, and the bird wasn’t easy either. They clashed mid-air.

As the ape distracted it, the lightning storm stopped. Chu Chen released the child he protected, exhaling a long sigh.

“Hey, Brother Chu Chen and Brother Luo Tian… where are they?” The child trembled, asking Chu Chen.

“Ah! I forgot about him!” Chu Chen slapped his head, a look of regret.

Chapter 1219: Battle with the Golden Ape

“Done!” Chu Chen’s face showed regret. He thought of the terrifying lightning storm, which had even wounded him. How could he not worry about Luo Tian, who seemed so weak?

“Sorry I brought you here!” Chu Chen spoke softly, his eyes scanning around. He hoped Luo Tian’s small body hadn’t been struck by the purple lightning.

“Hmm?” But then, Chu Chen’s face changed. His eyes showed disbelief as he looked at a distance.

Luo Tian stood there, unharmed. He gazed around the ruined mountain, then at the battle in the sky. He looked at his hands.

“I’m fine!” Luo Tian’s eyes also showed disbelief. He had seen the purple lightning destroy mountains.

How could he, so small, escape those dense bolts? He had thought himself dead. Yet the lightning hadn’t harmed him at all, as if it were raindrops.

“Huh?” Chu Chen was stunned. He looked at the scars on his arm from the purple lightning, then at Luo Tian running toward him. He was speechless.

At this moment, Chu Chen desperately wanted to know what Luo Tian was. Though he looked so small, he had repeatedly exceeded his expectations.

“Should we leave or stay?” Luo Tian approached Chu Chen, looking at him. He also didn’t understand why he was unharmed.

“Brother, your body is so strong. Stronger than mine!” Chu Chen spoke, his voice stunned. His own body was already powerful, but compared to Luo Tian’s performance, it had a gap.

“I don’t know. I just feel fine!” Luo Tian shook his head, a bitter smile on his face. He truly didn’t know.

Chu Chen signaled the village children to leave, then led Luo Tian to the cliff of the Purple Lightning Bird’s cave. His face showed tension as he asked, “Brother, use all your strength to punch this cliff. Let me see how strong you are!”

“Okay,” Luo Tian nodded gently. He also wanted to know if he was powerful.

He clenched his fists, roared, and swung with all his might at the towering cliff.

“Boom…” A thunderous sound echoed. In Chu Chen’s stunned gaze, the massive mountain crumbled instantly, turning into dust before them. If not for Chu Chen’s quick reflexes, they might have been buried.

The sound echoed to the sky. The golden ape and Purple Lightning Bird, locked in battle, paused. Their faces showed shock as they gazed at the cliff destroyed by Luo Tian’s punch.

The massive cliff was reduced to flat ground, not a single stone left. Beasts appeared before Luo Tian and Chu Chen’s eyes, then scattered in panic.

“Brother, I never thought you were so strong!” Chu Chen’s eyes showed excitement. He scrutinized Luo Tian closely. If not for this display, he would have thought Luo Tian was weak—worse than the village children.

“Roar…” As Luo Tian was about to speak, a furious roar echoed. The golden ape’s red eyes flew toward Chu Chen and Luo Tian, its golden fist swinging toward them.

“Little sparrow! Your child is gone. I placed them in your cave before. Now the whole cliff is gone. You figure it out!” The ape’s voice echoed in the bird’s mind, instantly making it frenzied. It opened its mouth and spat out purple flames toward Chu Chen and Luo Tian.

“Damn!” Chu Chen’s face changed. His massive body stood in front of Luo Tian, his thick arms bulging with veins as he punched the golden fist.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed again. Chu Chen and the ape both retreated, leaving deep footprints on the ground.
