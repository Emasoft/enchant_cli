"Damn it!" Seeing Luo Tian rushing toward them, Qiyuanzheng and his companions' faces darkened instantly. Though they sensed Luo Tian was now at the end of his strength, he still maintained the rank of an Epoch Master. However, they had suffered a severe decline in power after their blood-rebirth, now only reaching the peak of an Epoch Master. Against Luo Tian's current state, their strength was destined to be crushed.

"Buzz..." As the four men were stunned, Luo Tian's figure suddenly appeared before them. His fist, riddled with cracks, launched toward Yu Buxiu, the one closest to him.

"Boom..." A punch was thrown. Yu Buxiu exploded into a mist of blood, drifting within their sight.

"Xiaoqi..." Luo Tian opened his mouth and spat out seven-colored flames. The scorching heat enveloped Yu Buxiu's blood mist, sending up thick white smoke. Yu Buxiu's soul howled in agony as it was gradually refined by the seven-colored flames.

"Luo Tian, you are cursed by the蛮族. Killing us won't help you resist the curse's corruption!" Seeing Yu Buxiu's soul writhing in pain, Qiyuanzheng roared. If Yu Buxiu was killed by Luo Tian, it would be hard to explain to the Yu Clan.

"Oh?" Luo Tian's face curled with a cold smile. He surveyed Qiyuanzheng and the other three men, causing them to feel an ominous premonition.

"The curse? I've already broken it. Even if I hadn't, I'd still kill you!" Luo Tian coldly spoke without acknowledging Yu Buxiu's screams. His body radiated another surge of power, and he lunged toward Qiyuanzheng.

"What!" Hearing Luo Tian's words, Qiyuanzheng and the others looked in disbelief. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to have broken the蛮族's curse, a technique of the蛮族 kings.

"From the start, you were the loudest!" Luo Tian sneered and set his second target on Qiyuanzheng.

"Ugh..." But just as Luo Tian took a step, a mournful cry echoed. He halted and turned around abruptly.

His eyes then flashed with an icy glare, radiating a fierce killing intent.

In his view, the three-headed dog's massive body was riddled with wounds. Most alarming of all, it now had only one head remaining.

"End!" An old voice rang out. Qihongrui held a green long sword, its blade dripping with black blood. His face was cold as he slashed downward toward the three-headed dog's last head.

"Since you refused to submit, I have no choice but to send you to your death!" Qihongrui spoke softly, his voice laced with regret. The green blade's light resembled a jade moon, slicing through the stars and instantly appearing above the three-headed dog's final head.

"Roar!" Luo Tian howled, his battered body slightly hunched. He activated the封王战法 and rushed toward the three-headed dog.

Luo Tian knew that even if the three-headed dog lost all its heads, it might still survive. They had once severed all three of its heads and yet the creature had endured. But Luo Tian dared not gamble. He didn't know if this time it would survive, though he had only spent a short time with the three-headed dog. The creature had always silently protected him, treating him as its sole family member with unwavering trust. Even when ordered to fight a second-life immortal, it had never shown any resentment.

Even now with two heads severed, it hadn't sought Luo Tian's help, fearing he might be harmed by Qihongrui.

"Get out of the way..." Luo Tian unleashed his boundless potential, even burning his blood and cultivation to reach maximum speed. He arrived before the three-headed dog just as Qihongrui's attack struck.

"Plop..." But Luo Tian, despite his arrival, couldn't easily intercept Qihongrui's attack.

Golden divine blood splattered as Luo Tian's fist was severed by Qihongrui, nearly splitting him in two.

"Ugh..." The three-headed dog let out a series of whimpers. Its eyes turned blood-red again, growling lowly at Qihongrui.

"Kid, I didn't expect you to be so strong. If I had faced you alone, I might have let you escape or even been wounded!" Qihongrui's eyes showed admiration. Though enemies, he couldn't help but admire Luo Tian's brilliance.

"Rest assured, I'll let you die with dignity. I'll take the Epoch Scripture and perhaps glean something from it. There's still a chance to achieve that supreme position and ascend to the immortal realm!" Qihongrui spoke to Luo Tian.

"Old fool, do you think you've got me?" But before Qihongrui's words finished, a weak voice echoed in his ears. Golden light rushed toward him.

"If you were at your peak, I might have been cautious. But now, you're nothing to me!" Qihongrui looked at Luo Tian who had instantly arrived before him, and sneered. He struck with a palm.

"Boom..." A punch met a palm in an instant, the sound of their collision echoing through space. At the same time, Luo Tian's body was like a broken kite, flying backward and colliding with the three-headed dog's massive form.

One man and one dog flew back a thousand feet before stopping. Luo Tian felt as if he were about to shatter, his eyes heavy.

"Can't do it. He's still too strong! Though Xiaohei did injure him before, it wasn't enough. Those injuries didn't really affect his strength!" Luo Tian's mind was clear despite his dazed state.

"Final kill. Four Epoch Masters, one second-life immortal. If it weren't for Xiaohei's previous defense, I'd have already been destroyed!" Luo Tian muttered to himself, thinking desperately about how to break the current crisis.

"Kid, you're dead. The fate of opposing the Ancient Clan is one: we will surely flatten humanity. You're just an early departure!" Qihongrui sneered, his green long sword glowing again as he prepared to strike Luo Tian.

This time, Qihongrui decided not to give Luo Tian any chance. He unleashed his full power, confident he could kill any Epoch Master.

The green blade's light carried a destructive aura. Though it seemed slow, it instantly appeared before Luo Tian.

"Crash..." Just as the blade was about to strike Luo Tian, a series of bones fell from the sky. They radiated powerful energy and formed a bone dragon to block Luo Tian's path.

"Boom..." The blade pierced through the sky, colliding instantly with the bone dragon's overwhelming power.

Under Qihongrui's full attack, the bone dragon shattered into pieces, scattering as broken bones. Thanks to the bone dragon's defense, Luo Tian had a chance to catch his breath. The blade's power was also reduced somewhat. Luo Tian, who had just regenerated an arm, struck again with his fist against the green blade.

"Without weapons, it's really hard!" Blood splattered as Luo Tian's arm exploded again, making his face paler.

"Kid, I can only help you with this one. The rest is up to you!" Yin Yu's weak voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Ah..." Luo Tian nodded, his gaze turning to Yin Yu who was constantly clashing with the Mortal Palace and being suppressed.

"Kid, you're definitely dead today!" As Luo Tian was thinking, Qiyuanzheng and the others returned to Qihongrui's side. Their faces bore mockery as they spoke to Luo Tian.

"Dead?" Luo Tian gritted his teeth. He still had one last secret weapon, though he didn't know what state he'd be in after using it. But at this point, there was no choice but to use it since he had no escape.

"Sky Dao Thunder Sword!" Luo Tian roared, reaching out his hand. The Sky Dao Thunder Sword, locked in combat with the Qilin Seal, transformed into a green light and appeared in Luo Tian's hand.

"How? You're trying to make one last desperate struggle?" Qiyuanzheng sneered. They could sense Luo Tian's weakness.

"Any means are useless, right?" Luo Tian smiled coldly. He poured his Epoch Power into the Sky Dao Thunder Sword.

"Crack..." Two-colored lightning surrounded it. The green sword suddenly radiated an overwhelming aura, expanding dramatically in Luo Tian's hand.

"Hmm?" Seeing the sword's sudden expansion, Qihongrui's eyes narrowed. A strange sense of danger arose in his heart.

"To avoid any accidents, I'll just crush you!" Qihongrui looked at the Sky Dao Thunder Sword's growing power. His sense of danger intensified, and without hesitation, he poured his Epoch Power into the Qilin Seal.

"Crush!" Qihongrui pressed both hands downward. The green seal, radiating supreme power, descended upon Luo Tian.

Chapter 1666: One Sword to Heaven

The green seal, driven by Qihongrui, radiated terrifying power. It descended upon Luo Tian who held the Sky Dao Thunder Sword.

"Finally dead!" Qiyuanzheng and his companions' faces showed excitement. Luo Tian's name was well-known across the Nine Realms. For the Ancient Clan, he was a powerful enemy. Today, they had finally eliminated him, which would be a major event for the entire Ancient Clan. This would surely win favor for the Qilin Clan, elevating their status.

"Boom..." The green seal radiated overwhelming power. It descended upon Luo Tian, making his body tremble.

"If I'm hit by it, I'll definitely die!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with madness. He poured his Epoch Power into the Sky Dao Thunder Sword without restraint.

"It's not enough!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a bitter smile. Though the Sky Dao Thunder Sword was already terrifying, he knew it wouldn't be enough to block the Qilin Seal. Even if he managed to withstand it, both himself and the three-headed dog's condition wouldn't survive the collision's aftermath.

"I must block it!" Luo Tian gritted his teeth. He took out the Reverse Blood Pill and swallowed it without hesitation.

The Reverse Blood Pill's effect was immediate. His blood started burning fiercely, transforming into Epoch Power and flowing into the Sky Dao Thunder Sword.

"Crack..." Lightning erupted from the Sky Dao Thunder Sword, each carrying a world-destroying aura. They intertwined continuously.

"Buzz..." As if quantity led to quality, an unusual aura burst from the Sky Dao Thunder Sword. A wave of fear spread across the stars. This fear didn't come from Luo Tian or Qihongrui's group but from the supreme will itself. This aura seemed to threaten the Sky Dao Will, making it wary.

"How could this be!" Qihongrui and his companions' eyes showed disbelief. They hadn't expected things to turn out this way.

"What is he doing? It's even making the elusive Sky Dao fear!" They instinctively shivered, feeling that if Luo Tian unleashed this move, it could destroy everything.

"But he probably won't have the chance to use it! I didn't expect him to have such a technique!" Qihongrui looked at the descending green seal and sighed softly.

"Damned it!" Luo Tian's face was grim. It wasn't because of the descending Qilin Seal but because the Sky Dao Thunder Sword was consuming too much. It had drained not only his Epoch Power but also his blood.

"Big brother, enough!" Luo Tian prayed silently. He hoped to launch the strike before he was completely drained.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian smiled bitterly, the green seal thunderously descended. It was getting closer to Luo Tian and the three-headed dog.

"Alright, I'll do it!" Luo Tian gritted his teeth. He no longer resisted but actively sent his burning blood into the Sky Dao Thunder Sword.

"Ten thousand, a thousand..." The green seal was getting closer to Luo Tian. The aura of the Sky Dao Thunder Sword grew more terrifying, emitting a powerful pressure that made the entire starry sky change color.

"One hundred feet..." When the Qilin Seal reached a hundred feet, Luo Tian's body became withered. He looked as if a single gust of wind could knock him over.

"Buzz..." The humming spread. An ultimate aura burst from the Sky Dao Thunder Sword, radiating power across the sky.

"Finally completed!" Luo Tian's withered face showed excitement. He felt the aura within the Sky Dao Thunder Sword had completely changed. His gaze turned to Qihongrui and his companions.

"One Sword to Heaven!" Luo Tian's withered face showed coldness. His voice was hoarse as he swung the Sky Dao Thunder Sword.

"Crack..." Next, an aura not from the Nine Realms burst forth from the Sky Dao Thunder Sword. It transformed into a bolt of lightning.

The thunder was golden, lighting up the entire starry sky. It seemed as if the whole sky only had this single lightning bolt, even overshadowing the green light of the Qilin Seal.

"Immortal aura!" Qihongrui's eyes showed fear. They had once stayed in the Thunder Sea Marsh, and when they opened the Mortal Immortal Coffin, they had been annihilated by that terrifying aura. If it weren't for a great opportunity, those among them might have perished. Now facing the same aura as from the Mortal Immortal Coffin, how could Qihongrui not be afraid?

"Crack..." Next, the lightning collided with the descending Qilin Seal.

"Burst..." However, that Qilin Seal, which had been fully powered by Qihongrui and could crush an Epoch Master, was instantly shattered upon colliding with the lightning. It collapsed space and vanished from sight.

"Go!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with madness. His entire body looked like a skeleton, but his powerful spiritual sense guided the lightning that had shattered the Qilin Seal to strike toward Qihongrui and his companions.

"Quick, hide in the Mortal Palace!" Seeing this invincible lightning, Qihongrui, who had lived a second life, still didn't dare to fight back. His face showed fear and he urged the dull-witted immortal strength of the Mortal Clan to open the Mortal Palace.

"Ah... Alright..." The immortal's strength didn't hesitate. It opened the Mortal Palace, surrounding them with gray light and taking them in.

"Haha..." Luo Tian laughed coldly. Then his eyes rolled back, losing consciousness and falling down into the starry sky.

"Ugh..." The three-headed dog cried out, flying down to pick up Luo Tian. It didn't care about the terrifying lightning and disappeared into the starry sky.

"Damn it, that sword of his is too变态!" Yin Yu's voice echoed in the starry sky. The black Yin Yu chased after the three-headed dog.

Though Luo Tian and his companions had left, that lightning collided with the Mortal Palace. A powerful collision sound echoed in the starry sky, and an invisible wave spread throughout the Mortal Domain.

"Buzz..." Each of the royal clans' treasures rose, covering the entire continent and resisting that terrifying wave.

"What's happening!" The people of each royal clan showed fear. Even the collision of Epoch Treasures hadn't been this loud.

"Buzz..." The gray Mortal Palace appeared in the starry sky. Its massive palace was covered with cracks. If someone saw it, they would be shocked to believe that a supreme treasure like the Mortal Palace had cracks. This was unheard of in the Nine Realms.

"Cough... cough..." Qihongrui spat blood, stepping out of the Mortal Palace. His eyes showed a sense of fear. Even within the Mortal Palace, Qihongrui had still been severely injured.

"Buzz..." Three illusory souls floated out of the Mortal Palace. Their souls were weak, but their gray eyes showed fear.

"Almost... almost I was done for!" Qiyuanzheng's soul trembled as he spoke. Even with the Mortal Palace protecting them, they had almost been killed.

"That technique... it must be only an Epoch Master reborn who could withstand it!" The immortal's strength, also transformed into a soul state, showed fear on his face.

"What should we do? With this kid around, if he does that again in the future war, how can we resist!" Hunzhengqing spoke out loud, thinking of a terrifying thought.

Hearing Hunzhengqing's words, including Qiyuanzheng, they all fell silent. Luo Tian's existence was enough to threaten the entire Ancient Clan.

"That kid won't be in good shape either. Search! We must find him before he recovers and kill him. Inform your clans, even if we have to search the entire Mortal Domain, we must kill this kid. Otherwise, it'll be even harder to kill him once he recovers!" Qiyuanzheng's face showed madness as he spoke softly.

After that, Qihongrui collected the Mortal Palace and took in Qiyuanzheng's soul as well, disappearing into the starry sky.

Time passed slowly. It had been seven days since Qihongrui and the others had attacked Luo Tian.

In these seven days, the Ancient Clan received news and searched for Luo Tian's whereabouts. Luo Tian had suffered heavy injuries, making him easy to kill.

This news spread and caused a stir among the Ancient Clan. Thinking back to that earth-shaking explosion, they immediately connected it with Luo Tian.

The news of Yu Buxiu's death as a newly promoted Epoch Master also spread, causing the Ancient Clan to stir. The previous attack was now fully known by the Ancient Clan.

"My god, one person being chased by four Epoch Masters and a second-life immortal... he still escaped!" Everyone was shocked at Luo Tian's strength.

"Find him! We must kill him before he recovers..." The Ancient Clan people then thought of the powerful threat Luo Tian brought, and they started searching for Luo Tian in the Mortal Domain.

"In the Starlight Divine Clan, Fuxingxuan and her sister Fu Xingyue showed anxious expressions. They constantly ordered the Starlight Divine Clan to search for the missing Luo Tian. They hadn't expected that Luo Tian had been attacked so fiercely right after leaving.

...

In a hollow cave, the black three-headed dog continuously licked a body that looked like a corpse. Its six eyes showed anxiety.

Luo Tian had been unconscious for seven days, and the three-headed dog didn't know where to take him. It found a weak continent, where people could be killed with just one mouthful. It felt safe and chose a place it thought was quite hidden, hiding to wait for Luo Tian's awakening.

Chapter 1667: Thief

"Ugh..." Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, feeling a wet thing constantly licking his face. He then saw a black dog's head in front of him.

"Xiaohai..." Luo Tian wanted to speak, but found he had no strength left.

"It's been a long time since I've been this injured!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a bitter smile. The Sky Dao Thunder Sword had almost turned him into a corpse.

Moreover, Luo Tian now realized he had not only lost his cultivation and blood but also some of his lifespan.

"This move was strong, but it really can't be used again!" Luo Tian felt bitter. His eyes moved slightly. His whole body had no strength at all. If it weren't for a faint heartbeat and not too strong breathing, people would think he was dead.

Even worse, Luo Tian had taken the Reverse Blood Pill. Now he was just an ordinary person, even less than that.

"Xiaohai... bring me some water..." Fortunately, there was Xiaohai nearby. Otherwise, Luo Tian would be worried about dying of thirst or hunger during this time as an ordinary person.

"Ugh..." The three-headed dog felt Luo Tian's thoughts and let out a series of whimpers. Then it opened its mouth, spitting out a dragon of water that rushed toward the lying Luo Tian.

"Wait... go slower!" Luo Tian's eyes darted. He felt his body couldn't withstand the impact of the water dragon.

The three-headed dog sensed Luo Tian's thoughts and growled. The water then became gentle. Another head spat out a flame, making the water milder. It fell on Luo Tian's body.

"Crash..." Gentle water swept over Luo Tian, and he greedily drank it.

"Enough..." Luo Tian sent thoughts to the three-headed dog. After drinking a lot of water, he felt better but his body was still withered.

"Ah..." Luo Tian sighed deeply. His eyes showed a bitter smile.

"It's been at its worst!" Luo Tian muttered to himself, still having no strength. He lay on the ground, thinking about how to deal with the current crisis.

"Thanks for you!" Luo Tian shook his head, looking at the three-headed dog with a weak gaze. If it weren't for Xiaohai, he would have probably died there.

"At least recover first!" Luo Tian thought. A wave of hunger came over him.

"Xiaohai, go find me some food!" Luo Tian sent thoughts to the three-headed dog. At this point, he couldn't go out to find food himself.

"Growl..." The three-headed dog growled, its silver eyes showing concern. It then spat out waves of poison gas, ice, and fire, surrounding the cave. After following Luo Tian's instructions, it transformed into a normal-sized dog and rushed out of the cave.

"Buzz..." Although Luo Tian's physical body and strength were gone, his soul was still strong. His spiritual sense spread out to observe the surrounding movements.

"There's no powerful person here. Xiaohai has indeed found a good place to heal." Luo Tian's eyes showed a slight smile. He felt this continent was ordinary.

"It seems the Ancient Clan really wants to live in the Nine Realms for a long time. Even ordinary human continents have been moved into the Mortal Domain!"

"Unfortunately, if a big war really breaks out, these ordinary Ancient Clan members would also be affected. It would inevitably become a scene of bloodshed!" Luo Tian felt a wave of sadness.

Although he didn't consider himself a savior, and his hands were also stained with blood, he had his own limits. He would try not to harm innocent people. If a big war really broke out, the collision of Epoch-level powers could annihilate this ordinary continent.

"Buzz..." Just as Luo Tian was thinking, black lightning appeared in the cave. The three-headed dog's three mouths carried three wild chickens and appeared before Luo Tian.

"Xiaohai, cook them for me. Can you cook?" Luo Tian looked at the trembling wild chickens and sent thoughts to the three-headed dog. At the same time, a series of images appeared in the three-headed dog's mind.

Although the three-headed dog was still young and its intelligence hadn't fully developed, this task wasn't too hard for it. After burning two wild chickens, the third was finally roasted by the three-headed dog's flame. Though it wasn't very delicious, Luo Tian didn't care at this point. Soon after, he finished off the wild chicken.

"Let's stay in this cave for now. Xiaohai, you also suffered serious injuries. Take some time to heal!" Luo Tian smiled and spoke to the three-headed dog.

Days gradually calmed down. Besides the three-headed dog going out to hunt for Luo Tian, one man and one dog spent their days in the cave.

Time passed slowly. It had been half a month, and after recovering for half a month, Luo Tian could basically get up and move around. Though his body was still thin, it wasn't as emaciated as a corpse.

"Ah... how boring! Eat, sleep, eat, sleep!" Luo Tian threw the chicken bone to the ground. His face showed a melancholy expression. At first, he had enjoyed this life, but as time passed, he felt bored. The cave only had Luo Tian and the three-headed dog. Since the three-headed dog couldn't talk, he felt annoyed.

"Maybe we should go out for a look?" Luo Tian gently patted the three-headed dog's head. This continent had no one who could threaten him, so he wasn't afraid of any danger. After all, he had the three-headed dog with him, and it had fully recovered these days.

An Epoch Master on this ordinary continent was like a god. A single sneeze could control the lives and deaths of people on this entire continent.

"Growl..." The three-headed dog growled, its silver eyes showing interest. It had also grown tired of staying.

"That's it! That beast must have run here!" Just as Luo Tian was about to leave with the three-headed dog, several men's voices echoed outside the cave.

"Hmm?" Luo Tian showed confusion. Why were there people here? He had observed for these days, and this cave was unremarkable. The three-headed dog's arrangements were beyond the reach of ordinary people.

His spiritual sense spread out, revealing several strange beings. This made Luo Tian's face show confusion.

Several beings with tiger heads stood at the foot of the cave, looking up at the mountain. Their fierce eyes showed anger.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian felt confused. Why had they noticed this place? He hadn't left the cave for these days.

"Growl..." The three-headed dog growled, clearly understanding what those tiger-head people said. How could it tolerate being called a beast?

"Stop!" Luo Tian slapped the three-headed dog's head. His brows furrowed as he carefully observed these unknown race, strong people.

"You... did you hear that..." These tiger-head people looked powerful but had no cultivation. They were strong, just a bit stronger than ordinary humans.

"I think we should go back!" A short tiger-head person shivered, hearing the three-headed dog's roar. He was ready to retreat.

"Tie Zhu, are you afraid?" A tiger-head person looked down on the one named Tie Zhu.

"Rubbish, I'm not afraid. I just got hungry and wanted to go home for a meal!" Tie Zhu, seeing the others' looks of disdain, retorted.

"Want to prove you're not afraid? Then go first!" The person who had mocked Tie Zhu spoke again.

"Right, Tie Zhu, you're not a wimp!" The others also joined in. They had felt their legs shaking from the three-headed dog's roar but hadn't dared to back down. Seeing Tie Zhu speak, they pushed him forward.

"Go on! Who's afraid of whom!" Hearing their mockery, Tie Zhu hesitated but finally stepped forward.

"Let's go. I'll see who has stolen over a thousand chickens in half a month!" Tie Zhu gritted his teeth and cursed.

"Right, let's see what kind of beast it is. If it keeps stealing like this, how can we live!" Hearing Tie Zhu's words, the others also showed anger. Their courage increased.

"Chickens..." Luo Tian's mouth twitched as he looked at the pile of bones in the cave corner. His gaze turned to the three-headed dog.

"Xiaohai, those chickens you brought... were they stolen?" Luo Tian looked at the three-headed dog and saw its eyes flashing with light.

"Damn it..." Luo Tian rubbed his head in frustration. He couldn't help but go out now.

"Wha... what is this!" Soon after, Tie Zhu and the others appeared at the cave's entrance. They saw fire and poison gas, their faces showing fear.

Chapter 1668: Meeting an Old Acquaintance

Ice and fire surrounded the black cave. Waves of poison gas burst out, making the tiger-head people show fear.

"What... what is this thing? How can ice and fire merge like this?" The tiger-head people's eyes were full of disbelief.

"Take it back. Don't hurt anyone!" Luo Tian spoke from the cave, not wanting to harm these innocent Ancient Clan members.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, the three-headed dog inhaled, and waves of invisible energy rose from its three heads. It absorbed the fire, ice, and poison gas back.

"Nothing... gone?" The tiger-head people looked confused as those terrifying things disappeared.

"We should probably go back," Tie Zhu's face showed fear. He looked at the black cave, as if it were a big mouth ready to swallow him.

"This is Tiger Head Mountain. How could it become like this? That beast must be hiding in this cave. I need to kill him. Otherwise, if that beast comes out and steals chickens, it's fine. But if it hurts people, especially the children in the village, that would be a problem!" One of Tie Zhu's companions spoke. Luo Tian couldn't distinguish who was who, as they all looked the same to him.

"Yes, kill that beast. Don't let it hurt anyone in the village!" The others also joined in.

"Ah... they're so simple..." Luo Tian stood in the cave, smiling. It was his first time seeing ordinary people wanting to kill an Epoch Master.

"Growl..." The three-headed dog growled angrily. But before it could make a sound, Luo Tian slapped its head down. If the three-headed dog made a sound, these ordinary people would definitely be unable to withstand it.

"Tie Zhu, go in!" The tiger-head people felt a bit nervous. They told Tie Zhu to go first.

"Okay..." Though very reluctant, he gritted his teeth and carefully stepped into the cave. His companions followed behind him.

However, just as they took a step into the dark cave, six silver glows appeared from the darkness. They made the people stop instantly and shiver.

"Beast... beast, come out and fight me!" Tie Zhu held a iron sword and shouted at the cave.

"Everyone, don't be afraid..." A gentle voice rang out. Luo Tian walked out of the cave with a three-headed dog that was half his height. His eyes looked at the tiger-head people, but he wore a thousand-face mask, making him look exactly like Tie Zhu and the others.

"Who are you..." The tiger-head people's faces showed tension. The cave was too dark, and they could only see a silhouette.

"I'm a hunter..." Luo Tian smiled and walked up to them.

"A hunter?" As Luo Tian stepped out, the tiger-head people saw his face. When they noticed he looked exactly like them, their vigilance eased. However, when they saw the three-headed dog, they instinctively shivered.

"This dog is yours? Why did you encourage it to steal our chickens!" They still had some courage, but they asked Luo Tian.

"I have a pet. It's quite hungry. I was injured before, so I let it go out to find food on its own. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. I'll compensate you!" Luo Tian smiled, his voice gentle. He added some spiritual power to make himself appear friendly.

"Oh, how will you compensate us? Do you have money?" Tie Zhu's eyes softened a bit but still asked Luo Tian.

"No..." Luo Tian smiled bitterly. He had some yuanqi stones, but he didn't know what currency was used here. If he used something as collateral, it would be beyond the ability of these ordinary people to use.

"No money. Then what are you going to do? Come with us, and the town's chief will decide how to handle it!" Though they had some goodwill toward Luo Tian, their vigilance eased a bit. Still, they spoke loudly.

"Okay..." Luo Tian sighed reluctantly. Though he could have just left, he didn't want to. After all, the trouble was caused by the three-headed dog. Though they were ordinary people, to Luo Tian, it was the same. He would take responsibility for the trouble he caused.

"Go..." They didn't bind Luo Tian. In their view, they could handle him. The three-headed dog's fierce appearance was terrifying, but it was just a dog after all.
