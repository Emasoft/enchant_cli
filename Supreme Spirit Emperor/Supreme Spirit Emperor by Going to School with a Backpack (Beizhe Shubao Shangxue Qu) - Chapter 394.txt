"Only someone as powerful as Nan Gong Yuqing could endure such pain!" The onlookers murmured in awe, their expressions a mix of admiration and shock at the formidable techniques of the Soul-Subduing Master, who had reduced Nan Gong Yuqing to such a state.

"Stay strong!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, then spoke again with measured caution. He had done all he could; whether Nan Gong Yuqing endured depended entirely on him.

"Crack... crack..." A piercing sound echoed as the seven-inch Soul-Eating Nails were gradually extracted, revealing themselves to the crowd. Each nail bore jagged hooks, explaining why Nan Gong Yuqing's agony was so unbearable.

"Almost done. This is the hardest part—stay strong!" Luo Tian urged Nan Gong Yuqing, his voice heavy with concern.

"Ugh..." Nan Gong Yuqing mumbled weakly. His entire body was drenched in sweat, and the ground around him was soaked. Though he had faced many trials, this was his first time experiencing such excruciating torment.

"Boom!" As Nan Gong Yuqing's voice faded, a faint sound echoed from within him. The seven-inch Soul-Eating Nails embedded in his soul shot out of his head, visible to all.

Yet the ordeal was far from over. The gray Soul-Eating Nails erupted with a terrifying aura upon extraction, their overwhelming suction force instantly reattacking Nan Gong Yuqing's soul. It seemed to transform into a monstrous entity, intent on devouring his essence.

"Buzz..." The soul-summoning stone glowed ominously, its light penetrating Nan Gong Yuqing's body and stabilizing his soul on the verge of being torn away.

"I'll see who you are!" Luo Tian sneered, his hands moving with explosive power. A colossal soul-hand materialized, seizing the seven-inch Soul-Eating Nails and squeezing with force.

"Boom!" The terrifying nails exploded into a wild gray mist, swirling through the hall.

"凝！" Luo Tian waved his hand, sending waves of energy to condense the gray mist. It gradually coalesced into a form.

"This is the power of the Soul-Subduing Master!" Diao Dezhu and others marveled, their eyes fixed on the forming mist. They longed to know who had orchestrated this.

But as the gray mist began shaping a human form, the one who had implanted the Soul-Eating Nails seemed to sense something. The figure collapsed abruptly, vanishing into the hall.

"Damn!" Luo Tian cursed under his breath. He knew retracing this would be impossible now.

"How are you?" Luo Tian glanced at Nan Gong Yuqing's pale face, a faint smile on his lips. This outcome satisfied him—Nan Gong Yuqing had survived, though his soul was wounded. With the right elixirs and herbs, he would recover in time.

"Clang!" A black staff fell to the ground, its surface marked by two rows of distinct tooth imprints. The crowd's mouths twitched in disbelief.

"Damn it!" Yao Chen's face darkened as he grabbed the staff, his expression pained.

"Luo Tian, is this your friend?" Yao Chen gritted his teeth, staring at the weakened Nan Gong Yuqing. A desire to crush him surged within.

"This is my father's last remnant of hope! That bastard ruined it like this!" Yao Chen's eyes burned with fury, glaring at Luo Tian. If not for Luo Tian borrowing it, this wouldn't have happened.

"Uh..." Luo Tian felt awkward. He hadn't anticipated such a turn of events.

"Hey, Nan Gong, explain why you were so severely injured. Tell me every detail," Luo Tian quickly changed the subject, addressing Nan Gong Yuqing.

Chapter 1560: Fractured and Collapsed

Hearing Luo Tian's words, everyone fell silent. They stared at Nan Gong Yuqing's pale face, eager to learn the truth.

"After receiving a message from the Divine Clan's Sun Miechen, I went to the Divine Clan. On the way, I was ambushed in a near-fatal attack by three individuals—each one could have easily subdued me. They were all high-ranking offspring of Epoch Lords!" Nan Gong Yuqing's face was cold, his voice laced with bitterness. If not for his desperate resistance, he might no longer be alive.

"Three?" The crowd's expressions turned puzzled. If Nan Gong Yuqing had said two, they might have suspected Sun Huyang and Nan Gong Wuwei. But three? Where had this third Epoch Lord's offspring come from?

"Was it the Soul-Subduing Master?" Their thoughts were riddled with confusion, unable to think of anyone else.

"Who exactly was it?" Luo Tian's mind churned. While open enemies were manageable, hidden foes were the most dangerous—especially those who wielded Soul-Subduing techniques.

"Never mind. If they're enemies, they'll surely act again. What about the Demon Clan?" Luo Tian sighed deeply before addressing the Demon Lord.

"The Demon Clan is now fragmented. The emergence of an Epoch Lord's offspring sought to merge with the Divine Clan, but some agreed while others opposed. Ultimately, Nan Gong Wuwei used his authority to lead nearly half the Demon Clan's elders and disciples into the Divine Clan, merging with them," the Demon Lord explained, his eyes weary.

The vast Demon Clan had crumbled into this state within years—no one could have predicted it.

"Why did Nan Gong Wuwei betray the Demon Clan so suddenly?" Luo Tian and others asked, confusion etched on their faces.

"Because Nan Gong Yuqing was severely injured, especially before the arranged duel. The entire Demon Clan was in chaos. Nan Gong Wuwei is an Epoch Lord's offspring, and his prestige rivaled Nan Gong Yuqing's. That's why this situation arose."

"Moreover, he took the Demon Clan's Epoch Treasure!" The Demon Lord's face twisted in a bitter smile as he recounted the current state of the Demon Clan, causing Luo Tian and others to feel a sinking weight in their hearts.

An Epoch Treasure was an artifact of a saintly clan's depth. If even that had been lost, what could the clan use to intimidate other saintly clans?

"What's your plan now?" Luo Tian sighed deeply. He was Nan Gong Yuqing's friend but not the Demon Clan's leader. He could only do his utmost to help.

"At this point, we have no good options. Merging half the Demon Clan's strength with the Divine Clan's and two Epoch Lord offspring—this is beyond our current capacity to match."

"Don't worry, Demon Lord. We still have the Four Sacred Star Domains and the Beast Domain to support you. If necessary, we'll send people from both domains to crush the Divine Clan!" Diao Dezhu scoffed, addressing the Demon Lord.

"This..." The Demon Lord's face showed hesitation. Such a move would surely ignite a star domain war, making things even more chaotic.

"Old Man, what's the point of worrying about others when you're being devoured!" Diao Dezhu's face twisted in a bitter smile. He hadn't expected the Demon Lord to still care about humanity at this point.

"Yes, Grandpa, don't overthink it!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed cold as he addressed the Demon Lord.

"Too much bullying!" Luo Tian muttered under his breath. Sun Huyang and Nan Gong Wuwei had both attacked him, as well as Nan Gong Yuqing. This ignited his fury.

"It seems I've been away too long, making the Nine Domains forget me!" Luo Tian's mind sneered. He turned to Diao Dezhu.

"Dog, you're fast—go to the Beast Domain and Four Sacred Star Domains. Bring back the Ancient Heaven Palace and the Beast Emperor Mirror. I want to see what cards they have up their sleeves to dare attack me!"

"Grandfather, East Bo and Master Ji Jiuyou are occupied with other matters. We can't rely on them; some things must be faced by ourselves."

"When the two Epoch Treasures arrive, that's when we settle accounts. What are they to us? If they think we're soft targets, they'll learn a lesson!" Luo Tian's cold words echoed through the hall, sending a tremor among the crowd.

"I'm not a dog..." Diao Dezhu shouted in protest, but was ignored by all.

"Ha! It's about time!" Yao Chen laughed loudly, his eyes filled with arrogance. His fearless nature was fully revealed.

"Then it's settled. But where are Zhan Biao and Hong Zhe? They haven't returned yet," Diao Dezhu asked, his face puzzled.

"Right. According to logic, they should have arrived at the Demon Clan by now. No mishaps, right?" Yan Jun's face also showed concern.

"No, Zhan Biao's strength is well known. If he goes berserk, no one can stop him!" Luo Tian spoke softly but felt a shadow of unease in his heart.

"Let's rest first. We'll decide after Zhan Biao and Hong Zhe return," Luo Tian decided. The others had no objections, and Diao Dezhu left the Demon Clan for the Beast Domain.

Time passed slowly. The next morning, a long rainbow streaked into the Demon Clan's territory, causing Luo Tian, who was meditating in bed, to open his eyes instantly. His body vanished from the room.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian felt a sinking heart as he saw the figure. The returnee was Ren Hongzhe, who had gone to the Four Sacred Star Domains—but Zhan Biao was missing.

"Something's wrong!" Ren Hongzhe's form was battered, his face carrying a sorrowful expression as he looked at Luo Tian.

"What happened? Why are you so battered?" Sun Mengru, Yan Jun, and Li Tianzhi also appeared before Luo Tian, their expressions heavy.

"What happened? Do you know who attacked?" Upon hearing Ren Hongzhe's words, Luo Tian's aura surged but he forced himself to remain calm.

"Three people... as for their appearance," Ren Hongzhe smiled bitterly, shaking his head.

"Lead the way! We might still catch up!" Luo Tian grabbed Ren Hongzhe, who was barely conscious, and infused Epoch energy into his body.

"Go... it's near the Divine-Mortal Ancient Cave!" Ren Hongzhe knew time was critical. His face improved slightly before leading Luo Tian and others out of the Demon Clan.

Luo Tian followed Ren Hongzhe, his killer intent rising constantly. Zhan Biao had always regarded him as an older brother, and Luo Tian deeply valued this somewhat naive younger brother. If not for that, he wouldn't have brought Zhan Biao, a Divine Beast Clan's offspring.

A few streaks of light cut through the stars, instantly appearing at the entrance of the Divine-Mortal Ancient Cave. The shattered星空 indicated a fierce battle had occurred, but no one was found.

"Go to the Divine Clan!" Luo Tian's face turned icy. He had no more patience. Zhan Biao's disappearance had crossed his line. Whether it was Sun Huyang and Nan Gong Wuwei, he no longer cared—only those capable of harming Zhan Biao were few in the Nine Domains, and he didn't believe they were unrelated.

"Though unprepared, one Epoch Treasure—Zhen Tian Lun—is enough to intimidate them!" Luo Tian muttered internally. His face was like a thousand-year-old ice, and Sun Mengru and Yan Jun knew he had truly lost his temper.

Within half a day, Luo Tian and others returned to the Divine Clan. Their eyes fell on the golden continent. Luo Tian's lips curled in a sneer, with Yao Chen and Li Tianzhi standing behind him.

"Open!" Luo Tian roared, a white hand凝聚 from his palm and slammed down on the golden barrier.

"Break!" Yao Chen, eager to act, swung his staff and swept it across the barrier. Yan Jun and Li Tianzhi also combined their strength, sending waves of overwhelming martial arts toward the golden barrier.

At this point, they were all Epoch Peak-level experts. Their techniques were formidable; even a potential Epoch Lord would be in danger if attacked by them.

"Crack..." The entire Divine Clan trembled. The golden barrier shattered, and the land's mountains and rivers collapsed as it broke, shaking the Divine Clan endlessly.

"What's happening? Who dares to cause trouble in the Divine Clan!" A chorus of roars rose from within the Divine Clan, and figures darted out toward its exterior.

"Luo Tian, you've gone too far! Why have you returned to our Divine Clan? Do you think we fear you?" Sun Huyang and Nan Gong Wuwei appeared at the Divine Clan's edge, their eyes burning with fury as they stared at Luo Tian. Behind them stood the warriors of the Divine and Demon Clans.

"Hand over Zhan Biao!" Luo Tian's voice was cold, his overwhelming killer intent rising.

"Haha! Luo Tian, that person is the offspring of an Ancient King Clan. Humanity and the Ancient King Clan are sworn enemies. We killed them for humanity's sake—what's wrong with that? Do you really protect the Ancient King Clan and fight against humanity?" Sun Huyang laughed, placing himself on a moral high ground, portraying himself as the hero fighting against the Ancient King Clan.

"Die!" Luo Tian had no more words. Since they admitted it, there was nothing to say.

A massive divine map flew from Luo Tian's hands toward Sun Huyang and Nan Gong Wuwei, while he dashed toward Sun Huyang.

Chapter 1561: Battle with Sun Huyang

"Arrogant!" Seeing Luo Tian actually dared to attack them, Sun Huyang and Nan Gong Wuwei's faces showed anger. Their auras surged wildly.

Sun Huyang radiated white light, and waves of mist burst forth. He punched toward the Divine King's Nine Heavens Map.

"Boom..." The thunderous sound echoed. The massive divine map shattered in the starry sky, its violent waves spreading across it. The people of the Divine Clan were instantly alarmed.

An Epoch Peak battle was no longer about numbers; one Epoch Peak could easily sweep an entire star domain without any. Luo Tian and his group's top-tier battles would be beyond the reach of ordinary people, even those at Epoch End could barely survive.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian's body was also radiant. Nine reincarnation immortal bodies roared in his dantian, and as the Divine King's Nine Heavens Map was shattered by Sun Huyang, Luo Tian appeared before him. His supreme physical body delivered a punch that shook the heavens.

"I'll see what you're made of!" Though Sun Huyang had heard of Luo Tian's strength, having slain ancient king offspring, he was also arrogant. He couldn't bear Luo Tian's pressure and radiated white light, clenching his fists to clash with Luo Tian.

"Truly foolish. I've never seen anyone match Luo Tian at the same level!" Ren Hongzhe and Li Tianzhi's faces showed contempt as they watched Sun Huyang.

"Crack..." Thunder clashed. The two figures collided like meteors, the stars cracking. Their bodies reversed instantly. Luo Tian felt his arm numb, while Sun Huyang's arms were riddled with cracks. One clash revealed their strength.

As Luo Tian caught his breath, a vast black mist enveloped the starry sky. Nan Gong Wuwei's face was cold, like a reborn demon. He formed a black magic sword from his head and slashed downward at Luo Tian, its blade emitting thunderous sounds.

"Buzz..." But Luo Tian's face was cold. He moved his hands, and golden whirlwinds rose from the starry sky.

"Leave it to me. I'll handle one each!" As the whirlwinds coalesced, Yao Chen's voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears. His black staff turned golden, with nine true dragons coiling around it. It thundered toward the black magic sword.

Another explosion rang out. The crowd felt a thunderous sound in their ears, and the black magic sword was shattered by Yao Chen's staff into swirling dark mist that rolled outward.

"Dead monkey, you're seeking death!" Nan Gong Wuwei's face turned cold. He grabbed a black staff and rushed toward Yao Chen.

"Fight together!" Meanwhile, the Divine Clan's warriors and the traitorous Demon Clan's forces showed wild expressions, rushing toward Li Tianzhi and others.

"Overestimating yourself!" Li Tianzhi and the others were top-tier talents. Facing these veteran-level opponents, they showed no fear, their auras even more terrifying.

The Divine Clan's people trembled as if the end of days had come. With over a dozen Epoch Peak warriors battling outside the Divine Clan, their apocalyptic waves were beyond what they could endure. If not for the Divine Clan's unusually strong land, it would have been reduced to just its divine mountains again.

Luo Tian moved his hands, and the "Severing Heaven Seal"凝聚 instantly toward Sun Huyang. The overwhelming aura made Sun Huyang's face turn pale.

At this moment, Sun Huyang realized how terrifying Luo Tian truly was—not just his physical strength or martial arts techniques, but also on par with the offspring of Epoch Lords.

"Divine Sigh!" Sun Huyang's hands moved, white light flashing. A phantom appeared behind him, its face obscured by the light. It let out a long sigh, and an invisible wave collided with Luo Tian's golden "Severing Heaven Seal."

The wave struck the massive seal, which burst into a terrifying storm, sweeping toward both Luo Tian and Sun Huyang.

"Kill..." Luo Tian chanted the "Feathered Immortal Scripture," wielding the "Great Dao Sealing Fist." He dodged through the violent waves and rushed toward Sun Huyang.

"Are you afraid?" Sun Huyang's eyes flashed cold. His white phantom shattered, turning into runes that merged into his body. He showed no fear and rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Luo Tian, let's fight! See who kills these two first. I haven't killed anyone in a long time!" Yao Chen laughed wildly, his body radiating golden light as if mad. His overwhelming aura spread from his staff with nine coiled dragons, rushing toward Nan Gong Wuwei.

"Good!" Luo Tian clashed again with Sun Huyang. His body reversed, and divine patterns spread across his physique. Clearly, Sun Huyang had enhanced his physical body with special methods, making it nearly unbeatable for Luo Tian.

"Haha! Just you old guys trying to kill us?" On the other side, Li Tianzhi and Sun Mengru's group faced the Divine and Demon Clans' warriors. Though outnumbered by nearly double, they were top-tier talents—especially Sun Mengru and Li Tianzhi, who were no match for the offspring of Epoch Lords.

Sun Mengru's group radiated terrifying auras, their martial arts and techniques constantly striking down the Divine and Demon Clans' warriors.

"Alas..." The Demon Lord's face was bitter, constantly fighting against two former Demon Clan warriors.

"Master Demon Lord, if you're wise, lead the Demon Clan to submit to Master Nan Gong Wuwei!" The two former Demon Clan warriors showed no reverence for the Demon Lord, their attacks ruthless and deadly.

"Get lost..." The Demon Lord's face was cold. He had once held sentiment for them, but now they sought to kill him, making him lose all hope. His attacks turned merciless.

"Kill..." The battle began with a brief balance, but everyone knew that after time passed, deaths would occur.

The stars cracked, turning the entire sky gray. Violent void currents constantly burst out as they fought from the stars into the void and back.

"Luo Tian, is that all you have?" Sun Huyang spat blood, his body riddled with wounds. His blood flowed constantly, but he laughed arrogantly.

"What right do you have to be arrogant?" Luo Tian also spat blood, but his physical body was terrifying. Even with Sun Huyang's secret techniques, he couldn't match Luo Tian over time.

"Crack..." As they spoke, the two clashed again. Their bodies flew backward, and both moved their hands, sending out terrifying martial arts that collided with each other.

After the martial arts clashed, they rushed toward each other. They always fought with martial arts followed by physical clashes.

Meanwhile, Yao Chen and Nan Gong Wuwei's battle was fierce. Both were offspring of Epoch Lords, like legendary warriors constantly clashing.

"Haha! It's fun... the last time I fought that big fool was fun, but couldn't kill him!" Yao Chen's body was wounded, but his eyes glowed with golden light.

"Kill..." Nan Gong Wuwei's black hair flew, his magic sword radiating terrifying coldness. He clashed with Yao Chen constantly.

Luo Tian observed the battlefield, now holding an absolute advantage. A smile formed on his face as he aimed to turn this into a victory.

"Monkey, I'm going serious. Try your best!" Luo Tian laughed loudly, his hands forming seals. Golden light radiated from him as he slowly grew in size.

"Secret technique? I can too!"

"Manifesting the World!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed cold. With a roar, his body instantly expanded to a thousand zhang in height. His towering form radiated overwhelming power, making everyone feel immense pressure.

"Vanishing God's Wrath!" Luo Tian roared, his golden foot slamming down toward Sun Huyang.

"That is our Divine Clan's supreme secret technique, the Divine King's Ascension Art!" The Divine Clan warriors, who were being suppressed by Li Tianzhi's group, saw the supreme phantom and their faces lit up with joy.

"Glory!" The Divine Clan people roared, their voices filled with madness as they watched the phantom resembling a Divine Clan Epoch Lord.

"The Divine King's Ascension Art can summon an Epoch Lord's phantom, granting one-tenth of their power!" The Divine Clan people's faces showed excitement as they recalled the effects of the Divine King's Ascension Art.

"A remarkable secret technique!" Luo Tian marveled. Any Epoch Lord's techniques were terrifying.

Chapter 1562: Seizing the Advantage

"Boom..." The golden foot clashed with the white hand, waves of energy swirling around their towering figures.

Luo Tian knew his first step wouldn't harm Sun Huyang. He took the second, third steps, each making Sun Huyang's face pale.

"Vanishing God's Seven Steps combined with his supreme physical body—this is truly despairing!" Sun Huyang trembled, watching the towering figure advancing. His eyes showed madness.

"I am my father's offspring. My father once subdued the nine heavens and ten earths; I can do the same!" Sun Huyang stood within the supreme phantom, shouting.

"Only sword, severing heaven and earth!" Sun Huyang moved his hands. The white phantom did the same, raising a hand to summon a pure white light sword above his head. It severed the stars and slashed toward Luo Tian's golden foot.

"Pop!" The white sword instantly cut through several of Luo Tian's golden steps, severing the golden footsteps.

"Sixth step... seventh step..." The white sword cut through to the fifth step before finally stopping.

"Vanishing God's Six Steps!" Luo Tian was surprised. He hadn't expected Sun Huyang to force him to use the sixth step.

"Buzz..." Golden patterns flowed along Luo Tian's thighs. At the same time, Luo Tian emitted an invisible wave into his foot. With two supreme techniques combined, he launched the sixth step.

The combination of these two techniques made Sun Huyang feel immense pressure. Breaking Luo Tian's first few steps had already drained him greatly.

Moreover, the Vanishing God's Seven Steps was a process of building up. Each step increased his power, and the next step's strength would accumulate. Luo Tian was confident that if he took the seventh step, with these two techniques and his supreme physical body, no Epoch Peak could withstand it.

"Divine Subjugation of the World!" Sun Huyang felt that if his foot landed, even if he survived, he would be severely injured. Given Luo Tian's previous ferocity, he wouldn't have a good outcome.

"Buzz..." White patterns flew from Sun Huyang's hands, swirling around him and wrapping around Luo Tian's descending foot. This made Luo Tian's foot pause momentarily.

"Destroy it!" Sun Huyang's face twisted in agony. He stood within the supreme phantom, raising his hand to grasp the void. The phantom followed suit, but its movements caused the white patterns to transform into sharp blades that rushed toward Luo Tian's body. If successful, this would cripple Luo Tian's leg.

"He won't regenerate if his leg is severed. If it's truly destroyed, he'll be permanently disabled!" Luo Tian muttered internally, feeling this way.

"Crush it..." Thinking of this, Luo Tian became tense. He roared upward, his blood surged into the sky. His reincarnation immortal body in his dantian reached its peak, pushing against the patterns embedded in his body.

"Boom... boom... boom..." The sound of breaking echoed as Luo Tian's power and fierce blood pushed against the patterns. Each pattern shattered, while his right leg temporarily lost sensation.

"Vanishing God's Seven Steps... Shatter the Ancient!" Luo Tian ignored it, his other foot slamming forward. The seventh step of Vanishing God's Seven Steps crashed down, its massive foot shattering the void. It seemed to have stepped from ancient times across the river of time, crushing down toward Sun Huyang.

"Divine Subjugation of the World!" Sun Huyang watched the descending foot. His entire body trembled under the seventh step of Vanishing God's Seven Steps. A sense of life and death crisis surged within him. The white patterns long dragon flew out, wrapping around Luo Tian's golden foot.

"Boom..." This time, however, it wasn't so lucky. The golden foot crushed the heavens and earth, and the white patterns long dragon shattered upon touching the seventh step. A storm immediately swept out.

The thunderous sound was overwhelming. In an instant, the golden foot landed on Sun Huyang's body. Golden divine blood rose in the starry sky, and Sun Huyang's body overflowed with blood. His flesh cracked violently as he fell into the starry sky.

"Monkey, I'm almost done with this one. You're about to lose!" Luo Tian laughed loudly, extending his hand toward the falling Sun Huyang.

"Damn it, how strong he is!" Sun Huyang, though severely injured, remained conscious. He stared at the white hand reaching for him, his face turning grim.

"Divine Emperor's Sword!" Sun Huyang didn't want to be caught. He knew if he was, his fate wouldn't be good. Desperate, he finally used his greatest reliance—the Divine Clan's Epoch Treasure, the Divine Emperor's Sword.

"Buzz..." Light spread. Under Sun Huyang's call, the Divine Clan's territory glowed with brilliant gold light. It formed a golden line, bursting out of the Divine Clan and appearing in the starry sky. An overwhelming aura radiated from the golden sword, as if it could sever everything and shower divine light over Sun Huyang's head.

At the same time, Luo Tian's hand of Epoch energy slammed forward. It collided with the golden sword. The white hand shattered under the sharp sword's edge, scattering outward.

"Luo Tian, I know you have an Epoch Treasure too. But did you bring it?" Sun Huyang spat blood, standing under the golden sword's light. His eyes were fierce. This was his first time feeling so helpless.

"Kill!" Sun Huyang's face flashed with wild killing intent. He channeled more patterns into the golden Divine Emperor's Sword.

The humming echoed. Under Sun Huyang's command, the golden sword expanded dramatically, transforming into a sky-opening sword. It radiated immense power, as if controlled by an Epoch Lord itself, capable of cutting through all living beings. It slashed toward Luo Tian.

Even Luo Tian felt a surge of fear under the Divine Emperor's Sword's overwhelming pressure. His eyes showed caution.

"Epoch Treasures, we have them too!" As the Divine Emperor's Sword flew out, Li Tianzhi struck a Divine Clan warrior. He laughed loudly and waved his hand.

"Ugh..." The Zhen Tian Lun flew from Li Tianzhi's hands, spinning rapidly. It quickly soared to Luo Tian's head, expanding as it flew. Thunder surged from the Zhen Tian Lun, and sharp energy radiated from each spoke, emitting a cold glint.

"Crack..." In an instant, the two supreme Epoch Treasures collided. A thunderous sound shook the heavens and earth, creating a terrifying power that swept through the starry sky.

Under the collision of two Epoch Treasures, the battlefield paused. The violent power seemed to annihilate everything, leaving no one willing to attack their opponents. Everyone's bodies glowed with light, forming a barrier that protected them.

The power swept through, turning the entire starry sky into a vacuum. It lasted for several heartbeats before calming down, and the battered figures of Luo Tian's group appeared in the starry sky.

"Kill..." As it calmed, Luo Tian and his group rushed toward their opponents again. The Divine Clan's people, except for Sun Huyang and Nan Gong Wuwei who recovered instantly, were slightly delayed.

"Die!" Sun Mengru wielded a golden sword, appearing like the Nine Heavens' Goddess. She pierced through an old warrior's throat, and explosive sword energy surged within him. The old man instantly turned into a blood mist.

Li Tianzhi's body was surrounded by waves of thunder, like the god of lightning descending. Each wave contained a divine law's power, enveloping a Demon Clan warrior.

"Ah..." A pitiful scream rose from the thunderstorm. The Demon Clan warrior was annihilated within it.

The Demon Lord, Ren Hongzhe, and Yan Jun also launched attacks. Two Divine Clan warriors fell under the Demon Lord and Yan Jun's hands, while one Demon Clan warrior was severely wounded by Ren Hongzhe.

In just a moment, the battlefield changed dramatically. It tilted entirely to Luo Tian's side.

"Damn it!" Sun Huyang's face was grim. He hadn't expected the Divine Emperor's Sword to result in this outcome. It felt like he had eaten something terrible.

"Roar..." Meanwhile, Yao Chen and Nan Gong Wuwei's battle reached its critical moment.

"Why did I lose!" Yao Chen transformed into a thousand-zhang giant ape, swinging his staff to pierce the stars and smash toward Nan Gong Wuwei.

"Who is this monkey? Why is he so变态!" Nan Gong Wuwei transformed into a demon king, staring at the golden staff that smashed toward him. His heart was shocked.

They had fought for a while. Without fighting Yao Chen, one wouldn't know the monkey's terror. Yao Chen had no techniques; no matter what martial arts Nan Gong Wuwei used, Yao Chen would sweep them all with one staff. Or perhaps Yao Chen was born for battle—any martial arts could be found and countered by him.
