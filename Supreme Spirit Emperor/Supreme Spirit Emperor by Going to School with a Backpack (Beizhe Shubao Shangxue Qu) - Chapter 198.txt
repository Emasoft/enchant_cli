“Hey, didn’t you forget something? I’m holding a marriage competition here. Aren’t you going to get to know my daughter?” Du Hongtao said, his eyes glinting with a hint of amusement.

“Father…” Du Yuying’s face turned crimson as she approached Du Hongtao, gently tugging at his robe.

Luo Tian was taken aback. He naturally knew this was the marriage competition of Shanhai Sect. His desire to leave so quickly stemmed from hoping to escape while the crowd was still reeling from Gu Tianxi’s survival. Once gone, he would vanish forever.

Luo Tian hadn’t expected Du Hongtao to recover so swiftly from Gu Tianxi’s revelation, elevating the competition’s theme.

Seeing his daughter step forward, Du Hongtao’s face bore a confident expression. He knew his daughter well—she was undeniably endearing, and Luo Tian, a young man with fiery passion, would surely be captivated by her beauty.

If Luo Tian agreed, regardless of whether he was Gu Tianxi’s disciple, his talent alone would satisfy Du Hongtao. If Luo Tian truly was Gu Tianxi’s disciple, Shanhai Sect would gain a powerful ally—undoubtedly worth the risk.

Du Hongtao noticed his daughter’s flushed face and immediately understood she harbored feelings for Luo Tian. This spared him the effort of persuading her, a win-win scenario for this shrewd old fox.

Du Yuying lowered her head, stealing a glance at Luo Tian before quickly hiding it again, as if a ripe apple.

Lu Tianyu’s temper flared. Observing Du Yuying’s expression, he inwardly cursed: “You little brat, why be so shy? Your reaction makes it obvious you’re smitten!”

Luo Tian’s face bore an awkward expression. Scanning the crowd, especially Du Yuying’s rosy cheeks, he inwardly cursed: “Damn it, Miss, we barely know each other. Why this shy expression?”

Yet some things Luo Tian would never do. If he truly took this girl, returning to the Four Sacred Star Domains, his three wives would surely tear him apart. He vividly remembered their warnings the night before he left.

“I’m sorry, Master Du, I am already married. I deeply love my wife!” Luo Tian said, his tone laced with reluctance. Though he knew this would hurt Du Yuying, especially a seemingly innocent girl, he was principled. His voice carried a clear refusal.

“Did you just say that? Do you think Shanhai Sect is something you can toy with?” Du Hongtao’s voice was icy, and the temperature of the entire world seemed to plummet.

Chapter 896: Ambush()

On the Shanhai Sect’s plaza, all eyes were fixed on Luo Tian atop the platform. Their expressions bore disbelief; none expected Luo Tian to utter such words.

Du Hongtao’s face was frozen with coldness. His voice deepened as he stared at Luo Tian: “Repeat your words!”

“I said I deeply love my wife. I cannot separate from them!” Luo Tian stood firm, his gaze locked with Du Hongtao’s. Their eyes seemed to spark.

Jin Jingtian wore a faint smile, crossing his arms as he prepared for the spectacle. After all, this was Shanhai Sect’s affair; a rift between them and Luo Tian suited Jin Jingtian.

Du Yuying no longer bore shyness but a pale face, her lively eyes filled with disbelief.

“Good. Good. Good! For years, you’re the first to mock Shanhai Sect. I’ll give you one last chance: divorce your wife and marry my daughter! Do it or not!” Du Hongtao’s chest heaved violently, his voice laced with threat.

“Impossible!” Luo Tian declared loudly, resolute. His body tensed in readiness for Du Hongtao’s sudden attack—after all, he still lagged behind the early-stage Sage.

Du Hongtao stared at Luo Tian for a full minute, an eternity for the crowd. The Shanhai Sect fell silent.

“You may go. This is your only chance. If you offend Shanhai Sect again, even if you are truly Gu Tianxi’s disciple, we will be at odds with you. We’ll fight to the end!” Du Hongtao’s face was grim, his decision final.

“Thank you,” Luo Tian bowed, nodding to Long Jie on the ground. His figure shimmered as he and Long Jie became two golden lights, flying toward Shanhai Sect’s mountain gate.

“Rumors spread. People looked at each other in disbelief, murmuring that Shanhai Sect and the Golden Toad Sect had suffered a major defeat. And it was all at the hands of this young man.

Especially Shanhai Sect, their prodigy had been humiliated almost to unconsciousness. Their own daughter was rejected—truly a disgrace.

People could foresee that Luo Tian’s name would soon spread far and wide. This marriage competition had only one victor.

Another name resurfaced in the Fire Domain: the former Fire Domain Lord, the ancient sage Gu Tianxi.

After a brief uproar, people had to quiet again. Their eyes returned to Du Hongtao atop the platform, awaiting developments.

“Alright, the competition is over. You’ve seen the results. Disperse!” Du Hongtao forced a smile, shouting to the crowd.

Luo Tian didn’t fear Du Hongtao. Nor did other sects. Upon hearing Du Hongtao’s dismissal, people orderly left.

“Lu Xiong, Jin Xiong, we should discuss Luo Tian’s matter,” Du Hongtao ignored how people left. He addressed Lu Han and Jin Jingtian, saying they’d discuss Luo Tian’s issue—actually intending to inquire about Gu Tianxi’s supposed death. If Gu Tianxi hadn’t truly perished, their three major sects’ positions could be shaken.

Lu Han and Jin Jingtian nodded solemnly. The three of them became a streak of light, flying into Shanhai Sect’s back mountains—evidently seeking the sect’s Grand Master. This matter was too significant.

After their departure, Lu Tianyu and Ma Tianyang remained with a group of young people and several elders from the three major sects.

“Grandpa!” Ma Tianyang’s face was dark. After Du Hongtao’s treatment, he had recovered nearly fully. Yet Luo Tian’s humiliation wounded him deeper.

Jin Tianlu, who was more direct without Jin Jingtian, now held de facto control over the Golden Toad Sect.

“Together?” Jin Tianlu’s eyes brimmed with killing intent, addressing Ma Tianyang.

“Yes,” Ma Tianyang and Ma Feiyang exchanged a glance before nodding slightly. Two factions, four early-stage Sage-level warriors and four superhuman-level masters—this force could challenge even an early-stage Sage.

“We can’t kill you, but with this formation, how can we fail to kill one early-stage Sage?” Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu’s eyes brimmed with killing intent. They rushed out of Shanhai Sect first.

“Tianyu, we should go too! I want to teach this guy a lesson!” Du Yuying pouted, grabbing Lu Tianyu’s arm. Before he could react, she flew toward Shanhai Sect’s gate.

Lu Tianyu was unprepared but found himself lifted by Du Yuying. His face changed—though he hadn’t been cautious, her strength was formidable.

“Little girl, your strength has improved a lot!” Lu Tianyu smiled, allowing Du Yuying to pull him as they chased after Luo Tian.

“Unexpectedly met an old ancestor’s order to kill, saving us time!” A senior among the crowd smiled and soared into the sky.

At the same time, several superhuman-level masters showed contemplative expressions. They soared out of Shanhai Sect toward Luo Tian’s direction.

On the other side, Du Hongtao, Jin Jingtian, and Lu Han arrived at a modest cave in Shanhai Sect’s back mountains. Their faces bore reverence as they gazed at an old man seated on a cushion.

Only three sect masters of Sage-level could show such reverence. This person’s status ranked in the top five across the Fire Domain. He was a hidden strength of Shanhai Sect—Sage-level in the middle stage, just one step away from late-stage Sage. His name was Wang Jianzhou.

“Master, this is how it happened!” Du Hongtao’s face bore reverence as he recounted the events of the marriage competition.

“Gu Tianxi!” Wang Jianzhou’s aged face bore a nostalgic expression. As an elder who had lived countless years, he naturally knew of Gu Tianxi’s name. When Gu Tianxi became the Fire Domain Lord, this elder was merely a novice in cultivation. Thus, his memory of Gu Tianxi’s unparalleled achievements remained vivid.

Seeing Wang Jianzhou lost in thought, the three dared not interrupt. They stood respectfully, awaiting his decision.

“You two return to your sects and inform those two old men. For now, don’t act. Wait a few days; you’ll know if this is true or false!” Wang Jianzhou’s weathered eyes gazed into the distance. Through endless voids, he seemed to see Ma Feiyang and others chasing after Luo Tian.

Naturally, the two wouldn’t object. This matter needed to be reported to their sect’s Grand Master.

“Also, some juniors have gone to intercept this kid. You two don’t interfere; pretend you know nothing, understood?” Wang Jianzhou’s face bore a subtle smile as he reiterated. Then he closed his eyes again.

Hearing Wang Jianzhou’s words, Du Hongtao and the others were stunned. They hadn’t expected juniors to hate Luo Tian so much. Yet, thinking about it, who could accept such humiliation and let it go?

But soon they understood Wang Jianzhou’s deeper meaning. He clearly wanted these people to test Luo Tian.

Luo Tian was alone, his cultivation at early-stage Sage. Facing so many masters’ pursuit, how could he escape? If Luo Tian was truly Gu Tianxi’s disciple, Gu Tianxi would surely not ignore his disciple’s life.

But if Gu Tianxi truly appeared, these people would become mere cannon fodder—surely killed by Gu Tianxi. This could involve the three major sects, who would shift blame onto these people, claiming ignorance.

The three felt a pang of sorrow. Their hearts constantly prayed their disciples and descendants wouldn’t chase Luo Tian, for they were years of nurturing. If anything happened, it would be heart-wrenching.

They bowed and left. Wang Jianzhou’s eyes again bore a weathered look: “The great era is coming. You were once sealed by the Dao, and it was said you had perished. These years without your appearance—should you truly return, I wonder how much of your former strength remains. How long can you live? In this era, will you still be as formidable as before?”

……

Luo Tian and Long Jie moved through the star domain calmly, but his face was grim. He knew he had no danger within Shanhai Sect, but outside it, he did.

Yet Luo Tian knew returning to Tongtian Sect would be no help. The entire Tongtian Sect couldn’t withstand an early-stage Sage’s碾压. Unless Gu Tianxi intervened, but Luo Tian didn’t want Gu Tianxi to act—after all, Gu Tianxi’s life would be drained. Though Gu Tianxi would eventually die, Luo Tian didn’t want him to perish because of himself.

“Brother, go back and make a few of those pills for me. I feel if I take your pills, my strength will improve significantly!” Long Jie had no sense of danger. Still a childlike innocence, he spoke to Luo Tian.

“Alright, but you need to go back into the Nai Pan Dragon Seal first!” Luo Tian habitually patted Long Jie’s head, a look of indulgence on his face. His arm glowed blue as he sealed Long Jie into the Nai Pan Dragon Seal.

Just after sealing Long Jie, a series of breaking sounds echoed from the stars below. Golden lights sliced through the sky, instantly appearing before Luo Tian.

“Kid, I don’t know where you got your confidence. Not fleeing and just loitering around!” Ma Tianyang’s face bore cold killing intent, appearing before Luo Tian.

Chapter 897: Blood Stains the Sky()

Under the starry sky, Luo Tian stood calmly. He gazed at the figures before him—Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu, their faces brimming with cold killing intent as if they wanted to devour him alive.

Luo Tian’s gaze darkened. He scanned the group: “Just you four to kill me?”

“Do you think so? If I don’t rip your skin and bones off, it won’t satisfy my hatred!” Ma Tianyang spoke coldly, his spear radiating a dark glow.

“Four early-stage Sages and four superhumans. It’s quite challenging,” Luo Tian calculated the strength comparison.

At the same time, lights flared. Several superhuman-level figures appeared in Luo Tian’s view, their eyes filled with greed as they gazed at him.

“Just four superhumans. Do you think to target me?” Luo Tian’s gaze turned icy, his aura radiating a holy presence. A powerful pressure pressed against the four superhumans.

“Luo Tian, we don’t wish to be your enemies. We just want you to hand over that golden book so we can see it!” The superhumans spoke with caution. Luo Tian was surrounded, making this the best time for them to demand.

“Go away!” Luo Tian’s eyes held disdain. His voice rang out in the silent starry sky, striking the superhumans like lightning.

“You!” The four could enter superhuman-levels; they were certainly notable figures. Yet being scolded by Luo Tian made their faces flush.

But they knew Luo Tian’s strength. They stood in the void, neither intending to attack nor leave.

“You’re really calculating. Wanting to take advantage? Go away, there’s nothing for you here!” Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu looked down on the four superhumans. They wanted to take advantage, but it was their mistake.

Though the four feared Luo Tian, his back was just Tongtian Sect. As for that fool Gu Tianxi, they had long forgotten.

But Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu were different. They were the prodigies of three major sects, representing them—thus making the four superhumans retreat.

“Hmph. Just a prodigy stepped on by others. What’s there to be arrogant about!” The four thought coldly, bowing to Ma Tianyang and others before vanishing from their sight.

“Truly impressive. Having a powerful faction behind you does have its benefits,” Luo Tian mused, his aura gradually rising. His gaze was serious as he looked at the four who had surrounded him.

“Kid, prepare to die!” Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu rushed forward first, their figures flashing toward Luo Tian.

Ma Feiyang and the Golden Toad Sect’s early-stage Sage elder also flashed forward, their auras soaring as they rushed toward Luo Tian. As for the four superhumans, they remained still—knowing they were just decorations before Luo Tian’s group.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cold light. Golden light surged as he punched forward, meeting the four’s combined attack. This punch used the Buddha Heaven Attack Technique—capable of shaking heaven and earth.

In a flash, Luo Tian’s fist collided with the four’s attack. Thunderous explosions erupted, terrifying waves spreading outward, striking the four superhumans and leaving them in awe of Luo Tian’s strength.

“Boom… Boom…” Luo Tian’s figure instantly flew back, colliding with a star behind him. Blood spilled from his mouth, and cracks formed on his fist before healing instantly.

“How? You’re so strong! Four early-stage Sages, what can you do against us?” Ma Tianyang spoke loudly, his eyes filled with madness as he mocked Luo Tian.

Luo Tian ignored him. His hands quickly changed, the Golden Tremendous Seal fused with the Buddha Heaven Attack Technique, instantly flying toward the four.

“Indeed powerful. You two’s defeat by this seal is no coincidence!” Ma Feiyang and the Golden Toad Sect elder’s faces tensed. They had known of the seal’s strength but now felt it firsthand—Luo Tian was truly extraordinary. This seal could even challenge an early-stage Sage.

“Previously, we were careless. Now it’s not so easy!” Ma Tianyang mocked, his holy weapon flag in hand. He remembered the previous beating he had received from the seal.

Jin Tianlu also quickly summoned his holy coin, golden light flaring as it transformed into a toad made of golden spiritual energy. It rushed toward the Golden Tremendous Seal.

Though Ma Tianyang and the elder were masters of their sects, they didn’t wield holy weapons. Yet their hands quickly changed, golden spiritual energy transforming into a terrifying martial art that pressed toward Luo Tian’s Golden Tremendous Seal.

Though the seal was powerful, it couldn’t withstand four early-stage Sages’ combined attack—especially with holy weapons加持. It was clearly insufficient.

Thunderous explosions erupted, golden light illuminating the entire starry sky. Invisible waves even made Luo Tian stagger slightly. The four superhumans watching from the side instantly appeared thousands of zhang away.

The Golden Tremendous Seal was shattered by their martial arts, turning into golden light that scattered everywhere.

“Ugh…” The golden holy coin passed through countless golden lights, accompanied by golden flames. It instantly appeared before Luo Tian, slicing toward his waist.

Luo Tian had prepared for this. Knowing the seal couldn’t harm them, he used his golden fist, accompanied by roaring dragon cries, to meet the holy coin.

“Die!” Seeing Luo Tian’s move, they all mocked. Using his body to withstand a holy weapon—especially one with Ma Tianyang’s golden spiritual fire—it was truly self-destruction.

The golden coin, brimming with sharpness and terrifying heat, sliced Luo Tian’s waist. His face turned pale.

Blood spurted from his waist, dyeing the starry sky red. Luo Tian received a fatal wound, almost severed in half. Green spiritual energy from his body continuously repaired his injuries.

“Kid, how does it feel? This is the result of humiliating us. You thought just bringing someone up would stop anyone from touching you? This era belongs to the three major sects, not others!” Ma Tianyang’s face bore mockery as he spoke. They could feel Luo Tian’s strength was gradually decreasing.

“Kid, you killed my nephew Ma Tongtian. No matter who you are, today you must die!” Ma Feiyang’s face also bore satisfaction. Luo Tian was too dangerous; their feud had been sealed. If left to grow, Luo Tian would surely suppress Ma Tianyang into silence.

Luo Tian looked at their faces and smiled: “Do you think that’s it?”

“No, I suppose you have your own strength. A genius isn’t so easily killed. Just show us your skills. That seal didn’t threaten us at all.”

The golden coin above Jin Tianlu’s head, stained with Luo Tian’s golden blood, rotated again. His eyes bore a sinister look toward Luo Tian.

“Alright, since you’re seeking death, I’ll grant it!” Luo Tian’s voice was cold. Since they had attacked him, he wouldn’t hold back against their status as three major sects. He would just overturn the sky and leave, leaving no one to stop his departure—except for the three major sects’ Grand Masters together or their hidden strengths.

“Enter Demon!” Luo Tian’s low voice echoed through the endless starry sky. His dantian reversed, black energy radiating from his body—forming a sharp contrast with his previous aura. He seemed to transform from an angel into a demon descending into hell.

“His cultivation is increasing, his aura growing. Just one step more and he’ll reach early-stage Sage!” Ma Tianyang’s group turned pale, sensing Luo Tian’s terrifying waves.

Black demon sword in hand, Luo Tian had now reached his strongest state. Combined with the Buddha Heaven Attack Technique, he was confident even against an early-stage Sage.

“Previously at the competition, he didn’t use his true strength. He has hidden abilities!” Including the four superhuman-level elders of both sects, Ma Tianyang’s group looked in disbelief. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so deep.

Luo Tian ignored their shock. The first three blades of the Seven Demon Blades instantly slashed out, amplified by the Buddha Heaven Attack Technique. The first three blades could completely annihilate any superhuman.

Three blade glows shattered stars, emitting a continuous humming sound. They instantly reached the four’s bodies, making their faces change.

Faced with such powerful blade glows, the four didn’t dare to be careless. They immediately started resisting, spiritual energy spreading as their martial arts with overwhelming power collided with Luo Tian’s Seven Demon Blades.

A terrifying explosion echoed through the endless starry sky again. The four superhumans were pushed back a thousand zhang, even from afar they could feel the waves capable of annihilating them.

“Just this much? It’s not impressive. The show is quite impressive, though!” Ma Tianyang’s group felt the power of these three blades was even less than the Golden Tremendous Seal. Their faces showed disdain.

“It’s just beginning. We have plenty of time. I’ll play with you slowly!” Luo Tian smiled mischievously, a red holy drum appearing before him.

Chapter 898: Divine Clan Sage()

Under the endless starry sky, Luo Tian smiled at the four early-stage Sages before him. His black demon sword was raised again, and the Ten Directions Xuanyu Drum in front of him had red runes moving across its surface.

“Holy weapon. Seems you have some worth!” Ma Tianyang still spoke with mockery, his tone annoying.

“Two blades to finish you!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed confidence. His black demon sword was gripped with both hands, the fourth blade of the Seven Demon Blades凝聚. The Buddha Heaven Attack Technique was instantly infused into this black blade, directing it toward the Ten Directions Xuanyu Drum.

“This…” Feeling Luo Tian’s terrifying pressure, Ma Tianyang and the others finally showed fear. They could sense this blade would take their lives if not taken seriously.

“Let’s fight! I didn’t expect this kid to be so tricky!” The four hadn’t expected Luo Tian to hide so deeply and have such a strong backup.

They didn’t dare to be careless. Their golden spiritual energy was fiercely gathered, and in an instant, light flared. Jin Tianlu and the Golden Toad Sect elder combined to activate their holy coin, which expanded several times in size. It resembled a star, rapidly rotating and forming a spiritual energy storm with sharpness, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Roar…” The red flag flapped in the wind. Ma Tianyang and Ma Feiyang didn’t hold back, pouring all their spiritual energy into the holy flag. Golden fire dragons roared and circled above them before locking onto Luo Tian, rushing toward him with a roar.

At the same time, Luo Tian’s fourth blade was enhanced by the Ten Directions Xuanyu Drum. It hummed and surged through space, striking at the four’s combined martial arts.

Though this was only the fourth blade, it had been tripled by the Buddha Heaven Attack Technique and enhanced by the Ten Directions Xuanyu Drum. Luo Tian was confident this blade could annihilate an early-stage Sage.

“Crack…” Explosions echoed in the starry sky. Three martial arts with overwhelming power could annihilate an early-stage Sage. When they collided, it seemed to pierce the sky, terrifying waves spreading outward.

Luo Tian stood still. The four had retreated a hundred miles. Four superhuman-level elders accompanying them were instantly hit by the wild energy, spitting blood and turning pale.

“Blocked!” Ma Tianyang’s group showed a hint of excitement. They flashed forward, trying to seize the opportunity to take Luo Tian.

But in an instant, terrifying pressure invaded their minds. They shivered and instinctively stopped, faces filled with fear.

After striking the fourth blade, Luo Tian’s fifth blade of the Seven Demon Blades instantly formed. He clearly didn’t want to give them a chance to breathe.

The fifth blade of the Seven Demon Blades was even more powerful than the fourth. It was a qualitative leap. If the fourth blade could annihilate an early-stage Sage, then the fifth blade—enhanced by the Buddha Heaven Attack Technique and the Ten Directions Xuanyu Drum—could even challenge a Sage.

Black lightning surged across the sky, terrifying blade glows slicing through space. Deep grooves formed in front of Luo Tian, and the fifth blade instantly split the sky before appearing before Ma Tianyang’s group.

“He still has secrets. Is this kid truly Gu Tianxi’s disciple? How strong!” Ma Tianyang’s group were clearly shocked by Luo Tian’s abilities.

“Idiot, now isn’t the time to think about how strong this kid is. Think about how to block it!” Jin Tianlu cursed, his eyes bloodshot and face showing reluctance. He looked at the black blade approaching.

“Self-destruct your holy weapons, maybe we have a chance to escape!” Ma Feiyang and the elder decided immediately, shouting at Jin Tianlu and Ma Tianyang.

Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu’s faces showed reluctance. These holy weapons were given by their sects, even Ma Feiyang and the elder didn’t have them. Now self-destructing was truly painful.

“Expel!” Ma Tianyang’s voice was cold, throwing the red flag into the sky. Golden spiritual energy surged as he self-destructed it to save his life.

Seeing Ma Tianyang’s decisiveness, Jin Tianlu also showed resolve. The golden coin hummed and flew out, self-destructing the holy coin that had accompanied him for years.

Explosions echoed again in the starry sky. Fire scattered, spreading outward. Powerful waves impacted the four, sending them far away while their mouths spat blood.

The other four superhumans weren’t so lucky. Though they were far away, the terrifying waves instantly engulfed them. The waves annihilated them completely without a drop of blood.

Luo Tian saw the four self-destruct their holy weapons and sighed inwardly. His lips curled into a smile: “Back then, the scorpion self-destructed his holy weapon and escaped. I won’t make the same mistake. I’m not the same Luo Tian anymore!” His face bore a smile, his hand holding the demon sword. He looked at the black blade colliding with the self-destructed holy weapons.

The black blade sliced through space, cutting through the waves from the two holy weapons. Though its power was reduced, it didn’t vanish but passed through the explosion and continued toward Ma Tianyang’s group.

“This still couldn’t block it!” Ma Tianyang’s group were completely stunned. They hadn’t expected two holy weapons’ self-destruction to only weaken the demon blade.

“This demon sword is enough to make an early-stage Sage wary!” The four’s faces bore a bitter expression. Their current state was terrible, and they stood still waiting for the blade to strike.

The demon sword sliced through the sky, instantly striking the four. Their faces turned extremely grim. Their already wounded bodies became even more broken, almost severed in half.

However, the demon blade’s power was strong but had been significantly weakened by the two holy weapons’ self-destruction. It didn’t take their lives. At this point, even a superhuman could kill the four.

Luo Tian saw that Ma Tianyang’s group couldn’t stand up and didn’t kill them. Instead, he smiled and spoke to the void: “Aren’t you coming out?”

Luo Tian’s words exploded like thunder in the void, causing Ma Tianyang’s group to be shocked.

“Who else is there? Why didn’t we notice!” Their minds were confused, but they also had a hint of hope. They hoped it was someone who could help them, otherwise they would truly perish here.

Luo Tian waited for thirty seconds. The starry sky was silent, but no one appeared.

In fact, Luo Tian wasn’t sure if someone else was tracking him. But years of being hunted and his caution made him want to test them. His instinct told him someone had locked onto him.

“Still not coming out? Do you really want me to drag you out? That would be quite embarrassing! A true Sage fears a half-Sage!” Luo Tian’s voice carried disdain, echoing again in the void.

This time, there was finally movement. The void slowly split open, and an old man’s figure stepped out.

“How did you find me?” The old man floated before Ma Tianyang’s group, his gaze directed at Luo Tian.

“Early-stage Sage!” Luo Tian furrowed his brows. His gaze was on the old man, who clearly intended to harm him otherwise he wouldn’t have remained hidden.

“Four useless people. You can’t even defeat an equal, and you call yourselves prodigies of the Fire Domain. Truly disgraceful!” The old man’s face bore disdain. He didn’t heal Ma Tianyang’s group but instead crushed them with a single hand.

Four blood mists rose from the old man’s hands, making Luo Tian frown slightly. The old man’s actions suggested he wasn’t from the Fire Domain.

The only people who had offended him and looked down on the Fire Domain were the Demon Domain and Divine Clan. Both were first and second in the Nine Domains, naturally looking down on the Fire Domain.

“Are you from the Demon Domain or Divine Clan?” Luo Tian spoke seriously, his body surrounded by black energy. He looked at the old man and tightened his grip on the demon sword, unsure of his chances against an early-stage Sage.

“Kid, you know too much. Killing my Divine Clan’s people and appearing boldly—truly bold. Even the three major sects of the Fire Domain wouldn’t dare this. You’re from the Four Sacred Star Domains but dared to do so! Truly impressive!” The old man’s face bore a smile, revealing his identity.

“Divine Clan?” Luo Tian understood. This old man was from the Divine Clan, coming for him after he had killed their people.

“Originally thought I’d have to go to the Four Sacred Star Domains, but I met you here in the Fire Domain. And I found the Epoch Book. Truly a good opportunity!” The old man looked at Luo Tian, as if viewing a treasure.

“Divine Clan also knows about the Epoch Book?” Luo Tian spoke seriously, looking at the old man.

“Haha, we Divine Clan know everything. We even have a page of the Epoch Book. This Shanhai Sect is truly foolish. This fragment of the Epoch Book is more precious than an Epoch Treasure. Giving it to you was a waste!” The old man’s face bore indifference, obviously considering Luo Tian already dead. A half-Sage was strong but still insufficient before him.

“Divine Clan also has a page of the Epoch Book!” Luo Tian’s mind stirred. He hadn’t expected to gain a fragment of the Epoch Book so easily.

Chapter 899: Blood Battle with Sage()

Under the starry sky, Luo Tian’s body was surrounded by black energy. He cautiously gazed at the old Divine Clan Sage, who stood a hundred miles away. They stared at each other, lightning crackling between them.

“Kid, do you have any last words? If not, I’ll send you to the afterlife. Don’t worry; you won’t be alone. After killing you, I’ll go to the Four Sacred Star Domains and send your family and friends to join you!” The Divine Clan Sage old man smiled, as if giving charity.

Hearing the old man’s words, Luo Tian’s eyes brimmed with killing intent. His gaze was dark: “Do you think you’ve already won?”

“Haha, what do you think? You’re truly strong. Even my Divine Clan’s prodigy might not match your strength. But you are only an early-stage Sage, while I am a true Sage. Though it’s just one step ahead, this single step determines you are not my match!” The old man was calm. His entire body radiated golden light, like an ancient immortal. He exuded a holy aura that made people instinctively want to worship.

“Don’t test it. To kill me, you must be ready to lose a piece of your flesh!” Luo Tian’s face bore fierce determination. He seemed to return to the days when he fought without fear.

“Kid, do you think I’m afraid of your strength? You’re just a half-Sage. I am a true Sage!” The old man’s voice was calm, but his aura radiated overwhelming power.
