Luo Tian's body kept retreating. Every martial technique struck upon his form, causing him to spit blood. It wasn't just the power of their techniques; Nan Gong Yuqing and others' seamless coordination left no chance for Tian Ming to recover.

"Vast God's Four Steps, All Gods Retreat!" Luotian unleashed his fourth step without hesitation. Since Nan Gong Yuqing and Long Jie were present, even if his legs lost sensation, Luotian had no fear. A black foot shattered the void, crashing upon Tian Ming's body with overwhelming force.

"Crack..." A sharp sound echoed. After being battered by all, Tian Ming could no longer withstand it. His body was crushed into the ground by the black foot.

"Boom..." Dust surged, the black leg vanished. A hundred-foot-wide crater appeared in people's sight. Tian Ming lay there, his robes torn and bloodied, his body riddled with cracks, blue smoke rising from him.

"Buzz..." As Tian Ming staggered to his feet, three hidden snakes appeared out of nowhere. Run Hongyu held an invisible dagger and lunged at Tian Ming's back.

Shi Luo and Tian Luo each slashed his throat and chest, leaving no place for him to escape.

"Roar..." Tian Ming roared, his hands striking Shi Luo and Tian Luo fiercely.

Three sounds of skin being pierced echoed. Three wounds appeared on Tian Ming's neck, chest, and back—wounds that could kill him.

Shi Luo and Tian Luo were thrown backward. Diao Dezhu swiftly caught them, but the immense impact sent him flying as well.

"Boom..." The three fell to the ground in a heap, panting heavily.

"Gurgle..." Tian Ming stood there, blood gushing from his mouth. His body swayed before finally collapsing.

"Shi..." Nine-colored flames surged, annihilating Tian Ming's flesh and soul, vanishing from sight.

"It's done!" Luotian's legs had lost sensation, falling from the sky. Yet his face bore a smile. He waved his hand, and a golden small carriage reappeared beneath him, landing before the group.

Diao Dezhu and Long Jie panted heavily, instantly surrounding Luotian with excitement.

"Go help them. Hurry and finish it!" Luotian spoke softly, sitting there as he watched the other two battlefields.

"Master Tian Ming is dead!" The disciples and elders of the four sects felt a tremor. They gazed at Luotian's group with shock.

A true immortal late stage had been killed by a true immortal late stage. Few would believe it!

Yet Luotian's group had achieved this, thanks to their years of coordination. The main factor was Luotian's "Heaven-Soaking Technique," which had severely weakened Tian Ming, giving them the strength to fight a half-immortal.

"Kill..." Long Jie and Diao Dezhu remained by Luotian's side. Nan Gong Yuqing and others leapt into the air, rushing toward Xuan Dan's forces.

Previously, Shenglong Sect's senior elders had fought two against one, suffering heavy losses. Now the situation was reversed. With Tian Ming and Duan Fei's deaths, the four sects' morale plummeted.

When a leader was killed, the outcome was predictable. Within three hours, Nan Gong Yuqing's group of twenty thousand suffered three thousand losses, while Shenglong Sect's disciples were left with under fifty thousand.

"Survived!" Zang Yunfei, Peng Tiande, and Sima Xiu's faces showed excitement as they watched the bloodied Shenglong Sect disciples.

Catastrophic. At this moment, Shenglong Sect could only be described with these two words. The entire Mount Shenglong had turned red.

Chapter 2238: Desperation

On the bloodstained Mount Shenglong, disciples of Shenglong Sect wore expressions of excitement. This was their second hard-fought victory after the "Struggle for Heaven" battle, nearly annihilated.

Zang Yunfei and the other two elders wept openly, collapsing onto the ground without regard for their image. This battle had cost Shenglong Sect tens of thousands of lives, leaving it with only over fifty thousand survivors.

"We can't endure another!" Zang Yunfei spoke softly. If there was another, Shenglong Sect would truly be destroyed. This one had wounded them so severely they'd need a century to recover.

"Luotian, how's it going? This is the strength we've accumulated over the years. Now in Star River Prefecture, we can speak two words!" Diao Dezhu's face showed pride as he addressed Luotian.

"Hard work!" Luotian spoke softly. He knew Nan Gong Yuqing's group had invested as much as he had.

All of this was for them to establish a foothold in the Immortal Realm, allowing more cultivators from the Nine Domains to find them.

"Brothers, no need for formalities!" Nan Gong Yuqing chuckled but then changed tone: "But this might not be over. Although Ziyang Sect and Feishen Sect are silent, I heard that Qingfeng Sect and Juling Sect have Immortal Kings as elders. That's why their sect leaders didn't come."

"What?" Hearing Nan Gong Yuqing's words, Luotian's face changed. Zang Yunfei's good mood also sank.

"So I suggest Shenglong Sect should disband or evacuate now!"

"Currently, something happened in Star River Prefecture. We only received news from Ye Liangchen, telling us to go to Star River Prefecture. On the way, we heard about the four sects attacking Shenglong Sect, so we gathered people and came to Shenglong Sect!" Nan Gong Yuqing spoke. They had been stationed in a city by Ye Wudao, which was geographically and resource-wise excellent. That's why they had this strength now.

"Disband!" Hearing Nan Gong Yuqing's words, Luotian furrowed his brows. An Immortal King was enough to overwhelm them. Luotian could only save a few with the Heaven-Soaking Stone, but he wasn't sure about tens of thousands.

"How many people can the Heaven-Soaking Stone withstand now?" Luotian quickly connected with the stone, hoping for an exact number. If he could move tens of thousands onto it, there would be no fear.

"Little... master, you don't mean to move the entire sect onto me, do you?" Hearing Luotian's transmission, the Heaven-Soaking Stone seemed to understand his intention and trembled in response.

"Don't joke, master. I can only hold ten people. More than that and it would be exposed!"

"Back then in the Wheel Turning Hall was the same. If I passed by the Black and White Death's place alone, I wouldn't have been discovered. But with you added, it was found!" The Heaven-Soaking Stone spoke, making Luotian abandon the idea.

Luotian knew the stone's words had some falsehood. Perhaps it could hold more than ten, but definitely not tens of thousands at once—too absurd. Yet Luotian knew if Shenglong Sect truly disbanded, it would be finished. There'd be no chance to rise again. If they evacuated, where could they go? Although the Central Three Realms was vast, there'd be no place to land. They'd eventually be found by the four sects.

"Boom..." As they spoke, a tremendous pressure surged from afar, making Luotian's group pale.

"Dare!" A shout echoed. An old man instantly stood over Luotian's group, looking down at them.

With the old man's appearance, a powerful pressure surged from above. The area around him was wrapped in a thin barrier.

"Immortal King's Domain!" Seeing the thin barrier, Luotian's group's faces changed. They hadn't expected their opponent to arrive so quickly.

"This..." Shenglong Sect's disciples turned pale, gazing at the old man in the sky. Though many weren't caught in the domain, they still felt his power.

"Immortal King Early Stage..." Luotian whispered, sighing deeply. He now knew he had to face it.

"You dare!" The old man spoke coldly, his voice like a decree. A powerful pressure pressed upon Luotian's group within the domain.

"Dead!" Wan Lingkong and others' faces changed slightly. If they had time, maybe they could find a way to cope. But the old man arrived so quickly without giving them time to prepare.

Luotian formed hand seals, activating the Heaven-Soaking Technique to envelop everyone and resist the terrifying domain force.

"Hmm?"

"This is a domain's雏形?" The old man's eyes flickered with surprise, but his face still showed disdain.

"Amazing they could win. With this domain's雏形, even a half-immortal couldn't beat them. But it's still useless!" The old man stood in the sky like a sun, raising his hand slowly.

"Crack..." A sharp sound echoed in Luotian's group's ears, making his face grim. He could feel an invisible wave pressing against his aura.

"Boom boom boom..." As the old man clenched his hand, within the thousand-foot domain, Shenglong Sect's disciples who weren't in Luotian's aura were instantly turned into blood mist, vanishing from sight.

"Dead!" Luotian roared as his disciples died. His eyes bloodshot, but a sense of helplessness arose.

The gap was too great. Luotian couldn't do anything. Though the number of dead wasn't high—over a thousand—Shenglong Sect's every person was precious.

Luotian could only desperately maintain his aura to protect Nan Gong Yuqing and others. Yet his aura was beginning to contract under the domain's force.

"Old man, we're from Star River Prefecture's Mo Yun City! If you kill us, Star River won't let it pass. This man is also Ye Wudao's foster son!" Diao Dezhu shouted, his voice filled with urgency. Everyone felt the threat of death, and Shenglong Sect's disciples outside the domain also roared angrily. But before Immortal Kings, they were powerless.

"Old dog!" Luotian spoke softly, his soul began to summon the Book of Epochs to give this old man a surprise.

Golden light radiated from Luotian's body, and as the light spread, Nan Gong Yuqing's faces improved. Luotian's aura gradually solidified without cracks.

"Another treasure!" The old man's face brightened, gazing at Luotian. Diao Dezhu's words were ignored.

Far away from Shenglong Sect, an old man in white robes stood, his aura ethereal and refined. A golden light radiated from him.

"Difficult indeed!" The old man chuckled, flying into the air toward Shenglong Sect. But as he took off, a streak of light shot out, blocking his path and making his face slightly change.

"Jiang De!" The old man stopped, gazing at the opposing elder. Dressed in gray robes, Jiang De's face showed a smile as he spoke: "Nie Wushuang, you've come down with your avatar. Where are you going?"

"Go away!" Nie Wushuang sneered, golden light radiating from him. He struck out with a palm.

Jiang De didn't care, striking back with a palm. A golden and gray hand collided in the sky.

The sound of collision echoed, both men possessing True Immortal Peak strength. Their clash caused the world to change, far beyond what a True Immortal Peak could achieve.

Meanwhile in Shenglong Sect, Luotian was now enveloped in divine light. His body radiated an immense pressure. The previous terrifying aura had turned into a golden barrier, with divine laws flowing.

"Even if it's True Immortal Peak or half-immortal, they'd be crushed too!" The old man showed interest. He formed hand seals, waves of pressure emanating from his hands.

Pressure increased again. Explosions echoed outside Luotian's Heaven-Soaking Technique, as if the air itself was being crushed. Within a hundred feet of Luotian, it felt like a vacuum.

"Even True Immortal Peak or half-immortal would be crushed. How terrifying an Immortal King is!" Diao Dezhu and others sighed.

Luotian's face was drenched in cold sweat. The Book of Epochs radiated golden light, filling Luotian's body. The book itself began to slowly move outward toward his mind.

At the same time, dozens of figures flew from afar. Their immense pressure made Shenglong Sect's disciples' faces grim.

"Four sects have come again!" Shenglong Sect's disciples trembled, eyes filled with despair. They watched the first two figures approaching, radiating half-immortal aura.

"What to do?" Even Nan Gong Yuqing's hearts trembled. One Immortal King was enough for them to have no strength to fight. How much more so with these many strong people?

"Buzz..." As the group despaired, and as the Book of Epochs was about to leave Luotian's mind, waves of pressure echoed from above.

"Crack..." The sky cracked like a shattered mirror. A green hammer flew out of the sky, smashing toward the Immortal King elder standing in the air.

The green hammer looked ordinary, like a blacksmith's hammer. Yet its overwhelming aura made the Immortal King elder show a serious expression.

Chapter 2239: Lu Zhong's Power

The green hammer looked ordinary, like a blacksmith's hammer. Yet its overwhelming aura made the Immortal King elder show a serious expression.

As people marveled, the green hammer had already fallen, smashing onto the thin layer of domain.

"Boom boom..." The collision echoed. To their shock, the old man's domain was directly smashed by the hammer, turning into waves of heavenly and earthly forces that swept outward.

With the domain's destruction, the crushing pressure on Luotian's group disappeared. They all sighed in relief.

"My god, this hammer is so strong!" Diao Dezhu and others exclaimed. Luotian saw the green hammer, his eyes filled with joy. He stopped activating the Book of Epochs and returned to normal.

"Puke..." The old man spat blood, his eyes filled with shock. He gazed at the five figures emerging from the sky.

Five people stood, their bodies unusually strong. One of them, a black tower-like youth, stood in the center and was much taller than the others.

"Lu Zhong!" The old man spoke, gazing at the elder among the five.

"Xiang Ze, you're bullying these younglings here. Isn't that a bit shameless?" Lu Zhong spoke softly, his eyes showing disdain.

With Lu Zhong's appearance, the four sects' disciples accompanying Xiang Ze dared not move. They stood behind two half-immortals, facing off against Shenglong Sect's disciples.

"Big brother!" The tower-like man smiled, his voice filled with excitement. He flew toward Luotian.

"Zhan Biao!" Luotian smiled, watching Chen Zhanbiao rushing toward him. His small golden carriage slowly rose.

"Buzz..." But as Chen Zhanbiao reached Luotian's side, eight figures blocked his path. Eight sickles rose, blocking Chen Zhanbiao's way.

"This is my brother. No need to worry!" Luotian spoke softly, approaching Chen Zhanbiao's side with a happy face. He hadn't expected Chen Zhanbiao to come.

"You've gotten stronger, how have you been?" Luotian smiled. He knew if Lu Zhong had come, it was easier.

"Good, just too boring and hot. Always being roasted by fire..." Chen Zhanbiao smiled, his color had deepened.

"Haha, Zhanbiao, you're really strong now!" Diao Dezhu and others laughed, approaching Chen Zhanbiao's side.

"Luo Tian!" Meng Xue smiled, standing beside Luotian. Unlike Chen Zhanbiao's robustness, Meng Xue had become slimmer. Her appearance wasn't beautiful but definitely not ugly. Previously, she gave off a fierce aura, her robustness making her seem more like a man. But now, she had a womanly charm, especially with her long legs and full figure—definitely an exquisite beauty. She had more allure now.

Though she was slimmer, Luotian didn't doubt the explosive power within her body. It wasn't any less than Chen Zhanbiao's.

"Haha, big brother, I've got a wife now. This is my wife!" Seeing Meng Xue descend, Chen Zhanbiao blushed awkwardly. He spoke to Luotian.

"What?" Hearing Chen Zhanbiao's words, Diao Dezhu and others showed disbelief. They looked at Chen Zhanbiao as if he were a god.

"Awesome, brother! You've managed to get Meng Xue!" Luotian smiled. He thought only Chen Zhanbiao could subdue Meng Xue, this fake boy.

"I'm not as good as you, big brother. You have four wives!" Chen Zhanbiao chuckled, gazing at Luotian.

"What did you say?" Hearing Chen Zhanbiao's words, Meng Xue was upset. She swung her large sword, which was bigger than Long Yuan's by two circles, and smashed it down on Chen Zhanbiao.

"Boom..." Chen Zhanbiao didn't dodge, being smashed by the sword. He seemed to feel nothing. Everyone was speechless, silently thinking if their small bodies could withstand a hit.

"Enough, stop fooling around!" Luotian spoke, drawing everyone's attention to the two people in the sky.

"Lu Zhong, I respect you as an elder. This matter is between our four sects and Shenglong Sect. It has nothing to do with you, right?" Xiang Ze spoke, gazing at Lu Zhong. His expression was serious.

Immortal Kings have varying strengths. When Lu Zhong made his name, Xiang Ze was still a half-immortal. Moreover, Lu Zhong, as the top artificer in the Immortal Realm, had many strong allies. Many强者 were willing to help Lu Zhong, leaving him indebted.

"Xiang Ze, I have some connection with Shenglong Sect. If you leave now, I'll pretend nothing happened. Of course, if you're stubborn, there's nothing to say. Let's fight it out!" Lu Zhong spoke coldly. To him, Xiang Ze wasn't worth much.

"No way, our four sects suffered heavy losses. How can this be left at that?"

"Lu Zhong, don't be so disrespectful. Don't think your seniority makes me fear you!" Xiang Ze roared, his voice strong. Behind him were many people and two half-immortals. They could still destroy Shenglong Sect completely. He just needed to hold Lu Zhong back.

"Just because you entered the Immortal King stage a few days ago doesn't mean you're someone important!" As Xiang Ze's words finished, the void tore open. A figure stepped out of the sky. His body was tall, matching Chen Zhanbiao's height. He had a rugged face and a battle intent in his eyes, gazing at Lu Zhong.

"Juling Sect's Elder, Ding Tian Gong!" Both Lu Zhong and Xiang Ze spoke simultaneously, gazing at the tall figure.

"Master Lu Zhong, I think you should stay out of this!" Ding Tian Gong smiled slightly, gazing at Lu Zhong.

"Another one!" Seeing Ding Tian Gong, Luotian and others felt a sense of unease.

"Relax, your master can handle three or four Immortal Kings easily!" Meng Xue showed disdain, gazing at Ding Tian Gong and Xiang Ze, speaking to Luotian's group.

"…" Luotian's group was speechless but felt reassured by Meng Xue's words.

"Little sister, I've told you so many times to respect your master. Don't keep calling him an old man..." Lu Jiushan and Lu Xinshui smiled, speaking to Meng Xue. Clearly, Meng Xue had called Lu Zhong an old man many times.

"Meng Xue now has a powerful background!"

"Her father is an Immortal King, and your master is also one. Haha, Zhanbiao, you've really hit the jackpot!" Diao Dezhu patted Chen Zhanbiao's shoulder.

"Meng Xue, did your father come? If he did, it would be safe!" Wan Lingkong spoke to Meng Xue.

"He should come. I've sent him a message!" Meng Xue spoke softly, smiling.

"It seems you two are really stubborn. Well, I haven't fought in a while. Today I'll stretch my limbs!" Lu Zhong saw the battle intent in Ding Tian Gong and Xiang Ze's eyes. He spoke softly, returning his green hammer to his hand.

"Buzz..." Ding Tian Gong and Xiang Ze's faces turned serious. They gazed at Lu Zhong holding the hammer, feeling his power had changed.

Both men's auras rose. They stood together, and a tremendous pressure spread around them, golden and green domains extending outward.

"Ten feet... one hundred feet... a thousand feet..." In an instant, the dual-color domain spread to three thousand feet.

"Three thousand feet... this is them merging their domains!" Diao Dezhu and others watched the three-thousand-foot dual-color domain, standing under Luotian's Heaven-Soaking Technique.

Lu Zhong remained calm, showing no surprise. A True Immortal King Early Stage's domain was normally a thousand feet. Within that range, the Immortal King ruled.

But merging two domains wasn't simply one plus one.

"Good, there's a method for domain fusion!" Lu Zhong spoke softly, his aura beginning to expand outward.

"Boom..." The next moment, Lu Zhong's domain appeared. A thunderous sound echoed in people's ears, like lightning spreading outward.

"Crush..." As everyone was stunned, a thunderous crack echoed. The three-thousand-foot domain shattered, crushed by the lightning domain. Ding Tian Gong and Xiang Ze spat blood, their faces filled with disbelief.

"How is this possible!" Their pale faces showed shock. They hadn't expected their combined domain to be no match for Lu Zhong.

Lightning roamed, expanding to four thousand feet. It enveloped Ding Tian Gong and Xiang Ze, a tremendous pressure making their faces grim.

"It's almost reaching the Immortal King Mid-Stage!" Ding Tian Gong spoke in shock. He then moved, trying to escape Lu Zhong's domain.

Xiang Ze also flew up. They knew if they stayed in Lu Zhong's domain, there was no chance to defeat him.

"Buzz..." As they moved, Lu Zhong acted. His green hammer emitted waves of energy, swinging it.

"Crash..." Lightning flowed around the green hammer. The four-thousand-foot domain trembled, invisible waves adding power to the green hammer.

"Wind of a Thousand Blows!" Luotian was stunned, watching the green hammer descend. He hadn't seen how many times Lu Zhong swung it before. Now, as a True Immortal Peak and with his own mastery of the Wind of a Thousand Blows, he still couldn't see how many times Lu Zhong had swung it.

Chapter 2240: The Trap

The green hammer, wrapped in lightning and enhanced by invisible heavenly forces, smashed onto Ding Tian Gong's chest.

"Crack..." Ding Tian Gong was wrapped in lightning. His body flew backward, spitting blood as he was smashed into the ground.

One strike had severely wounded Ding Tian Gong. Seizing this opportunity, Xiang Ze's face turned pale and fled Lu Zhong's domain. He watched Ding Tian Gong smashed into the ground, his heart trembling.

Though he hadn't faced that strike, Xiang Ze could feel its power. If he had faced it, he would be worse off than Ding Tian Gong. Xiang Ze realized they were on a different level from Lu Zhong.

Luotian was also stunned, watching Lu Zhong. He hadn't seen how many times he swung the hammer before. Now, with his current strength and mastery of Wind of a Thousand Blows, he still couldn't see how many times Lu Zhong had swung it.

Others saw even less. They only saw one strike, which left Ding Tian Gong half-dead.

"Too terrifying! This old man is too strong!" Diao Dezhu and others showed reverence, gazing at Lu Zhong standing there. His green hammer seemed to hold the entire world, a supreme aura rising from him.

"Master Lu Zhong, we've made our mistake. We surrender!" Xiang Ze shouted loudly, his voice filled with fear. He yelled at Qingfeng Sect's people.

"Retreat! Get out of here!" Xiang Ze anxiously shouted, bowing deeply to Lu Zhong. He flew away without hesitation.

"I also surrender!" Ding Tian Gong stood up, trembling. He gazed at Lu Zhong with reverence. That one strike had completely awakened him. He realized that even though he had entered the Immortal King Early Stage, against Lu Zhong's strength, he was still no match.

"How strong! Against Master Lu Zhong, Ding Elder had no chance at all. Why are there such differences among Immortal King Early Stages?" The disciples of the four sects showed fear, gazing at Lu Zhong.

"Next time, remember to respect the elderly and care for the young!" Lu Zhong sneered. He didn't stop Ding Tian Gong and Xiang Ze from leaving. He could have forced them to stay, but it would cost him some effort.

"Yes!" Ding Tian Gong spoke while spitting blood. He moved, flying away. The four sects' disciples also stood up, gazing at Lu Zhong with reverence and followed Ding Tian Gong away.

Seeing the four sects' disciples leave, Luotian and Zang Yunfei sighed in relief. This crisis was finally over.

"Entering the Immortal King stage is what truly allows one to stand in the Immortal Realm!" Luotian sighed inwardly. His strength was still insufficient.

"Thank you, Master, for helping Shenglong Sect through this crisis!" Zang Yunfei and others showed respect. The disciples of Shenglong Sect all knelt, shouting.

Lu Zhong's rescue had saved tens of thousands of lives. How could Shenglong Sect not be grateful?

"Old, I'm no longer as strong as before!" Lu Zhong shook his head lightly. If it were his younger self, Ding Tian Gong and Xiang Ze wouldn't have left so easily.

"Don't thank me. I wouldn't have come without this kid. So if you want to thank, thank him!" Lu Zhong smiled, gazing at Luotian with admiration.

"Unfortunately, I can't pass on my legacy. But Zhanbiao is a good kid!" Lu Zhong thought to himself.

"Enough, you two catch up. You've been apart for a long time!" Lu Zhong gazed at Chen Zhanbiao, who was still close to Luotian. He felt his disciple had been nurtured for Luotian.

These years, Lu Zhong had cared deeply about Chen Zhanbiao, teaching him everything. He was more like a father than a master.

"Don't corrupt my precious disciple!" Lu Zhong gazed at Luotian's group, especially lingering on Diao Dezhu. He felt these kids weren't good.

"Master, don't worry. Zhanbiao and us are long-time brothers. We'll take good care of him!" Diao Dezhu quickly assured, speaking to Lu Zhong.

After saying this, Lu Zhong flew into the sky and disappeared from sight. Shenglong Sect's people became excited again.

"It's finally over!" Luotian sighed, his gaze turning cold. Though the matter had passed, he had formed a grudge.

"Luotian, we should go to Star River Prefecture!" Nan Gong Yuqing spoke. His gaze showed concern. Compared to Shenglong Sect, he was more worried about Star River Prefecture.

Star River Prefecture was their base. If something happened there, they would suffer greatly.

"Entering the Immortal King stage, any one of us can establish a sect! Then we'll avenge today's grudge!" Luotian spoke softly, nodding.

"Three Elders, we're leaving for Star River Prefecture. Take care of Shenglong Sect here. If anything happens, contact me!" Luotian spoke to Zang Yunfei and the others. Their faces showed a smile.

"Go ahead, if we need you, just say so. Now the lives of all Shenglong Sect disciples are yours!" Zang Yunfei replied.

Nan Gong Yuqing and others left the remaining ten thousand people behind. They flew into the sky, heading toward Star River Prefecture.

A group of nearly twenty people flew toward Star River Prefecture. Along the way, they shared stories. Luotian's experiences in hell amazed them.

"So that means we can revive if we aren't destroyed?" Diao Dezhu's eyes showed excitement.

"Generally, that's the case!" Luotian nodded. After all, his wife controlled the彼岸花 (Biyanghua) in hell.

"But that's a last resort. Don't die for fun!" Luotian spoke softly. He knew reviving in hell required an Immortal King. Though he could ask Du Jianhang, it was better not to trouble him.

"By the way, Sun Kelian's bastard is doing well. He's visited us several times over these years. I've also sent him messages, but that bastard might have gone to another graveyard. He probably didn't receive the message!"

"Also, don't tell anyone you know them outside. Those two bastards have become quite famous in the Central Three Realms recently. But like before, they're notorious. However, they have Daitian's Master behind them. This Daitian's Master is renowned in the Central Three Realms, no one dares to provoke him. That's why they're living comfortably." Diao Dezhu showed envy, speaking to Luotian.

In the Nine Domains, Diao Dezhu was a typical person relying on his grandfather. But in the Immortal Realm, he had to rely on himself.

"We've searched everywhere for old masters but found none. However, the Central Three Realms is vast. If we have our own forces, maybe we can attract more cultivators from the Nine Domains!" Nan Gong Yuqing spoke softly, telling Luotian about their situation.

Time passed. Two days later, they finally reached the foot of Star River Prefecture. Luotian sat on his golden carriage, his face showing admiration as he gazed at the vast Star River Prefecture.

Star River Prefecture remained grand, but Luotian's group felt a sense of tension.

"We are from Star River Prefecture's Mo Yun City. I am the city's master, Nan Gong Yuqing!" Nan Gong Yuqing spoke softly, handing over a token to two disciples guarding the gate.

"Yes!" The two disciples straightened slightly. They let Nan Gong Yuqing's group in through the gate.

Star River Prefecture was still as lively as ever. The entire Star River Prefecture seemed unaffected, and the group's arrival only drew people's attention without much focus.

"What's going on?" Luotian and others were confused. They had been told something happened in Star River Prefecture.

"Send a message to Ye Liangchen, ask what's going on!" Luotian waved his hand, taking out Star River Prefecture's token to send a message to Ye Liangchen. He had been unable to contact him since arriving at Star River Prefecture's gate.

As soon as Luotian sent the message, Ye Liangchen hurriedly came out from afar. His eyes showed joy.

"Haha, Tian Ge, I knew you'd come back!" Ye Liangchen laughed, his voice filled with joy.

"Liangchen, are you okay?" Seeing Ye Liangchen's arrogant demeanor, Luotian furrowed his brows. A strange feeling arose in his heart.

"Okay? What's wrong?" Ye Liangchen was confused, gazing at Luotian and the others.

"Everyone's here? Come on, I'll treat you to something good today!"

"Tian Ge, your legs, why are they like this again?" Ye Liangchen didn't say anything and pushed Luotian toward the depths of Star River Prefecture.

Luotian's face showed a smile, but his mind was more puzzled. Nan Gong Yuqing and others had no expression, with the Eight Guardians of the Underworld surrounding Luotian, carefully watching their surroundings.

"Tian Ge, these eight guys are really cool. If I have time, I'll get some too!" Ye Liangchen showed envy, gazing at the Eight Guardians of the Underworld.

"You little guy..." Luotian chuckled, following Ye Liangchen into Star River Prefecture's depths. His mind was more puzzled.

"Nothing at all? Did they really not care about Shenglong Sect?" Luotian's mind was full of questions. Shenglong Sect was just one, but why did the four sects suddenly attack it? Who gave them the news? Why was Ye Liangchen so ignorant?
