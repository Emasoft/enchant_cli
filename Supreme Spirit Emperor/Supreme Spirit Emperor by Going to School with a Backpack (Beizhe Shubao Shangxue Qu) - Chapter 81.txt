However, soon after, Luo Tian felt a presence before his eyes like a fly. No matter how strong his cultivation was, he could not resist the humming sound that resembled recitation.

“Pap…” Luo Tian’s hand, still asleep, slammed forward.

At this moment, Zheng Xin arrived at Luo Tian’s bedside, muttering incessantly. As she leaned down to carry him, a large hand slammed onto her face with a crisp sound.

“Cough!” Luo Tian’s eyes, still closed, furrowed slightly. His eyes slowly opened, and upon seeing Zheng Xin’s face marked with a red handprint, he found her glaring at him with resentment.

“Zheng Xin, what’s wrong with you?” Luo Tian wore an expression of confusion as he spoke softly.

“You, Luo Tian, you… you… you’ve driven me mad!” Seeing Luo Tian’s innocent gaze, Zheng Xin, usually eloquent, could not utter a word.

“Leng Qiuchan, your man has awakened!” Zheng Xin clutched her face and shouted toward the door. Ignoring Luo Tian’s pale complexion, she stormed out in a huff.

A fragrant breeze drifted in as Leng Qiuchan, her face alight with surprise, stepped into the bamboo hut. She rushed in and scrutinized Luo Tian.

Seeing Leng Qiuchan enter, Luo Tian let out a soft laugh and asked, “What’s wrong with Zheng Xin?”

“Don’t mind him. How are you? Have you recovered?” Leng Qiuchan quickly inquired about Luo Tian’s condition.

Luo Tian subtly assessed his physical state and smiled: “I’m about eight-tenths better. No problem!”

“Congratulations, Brother Luo, on your recovery. Your constitution is truly rare; I’ve never seen someone injured as severely as you heal in three days! This recovery speed is enough to make even geniuses envious!” Jiang Nanxuan and Meng Yao entered with smiles, their eyes filled with admiration.

“Thanks to Jiang Xiong and Meng Yao’s sister, I wouldn’t have recovered so quickly,” Luo Tian replied politely.

“Enough with the formalities. Stay here for a few more days,” Jiang Nanxuan said gently, urging Luo Tian to remain.

Hearing Jiang Nanxuan’s words, Luo Tian felt a flicker of doubt. Jiang Nanxuan had always seemed enigmatic, lacking spiritual energy, yet Luo Tian sensed his soul was remarkably powerful. His mastery of formations and seals was unparalleled.

“Alright,” Luo Tian mused briefly before agreeing. After all, he had nowhere else to go.

“Big brother…” Long Baobei rushed into the room like a dragon storm, his face beaming with joy.

Seeing Long Baobei unharmed, Luo Tian smiled gently and patted his head: “Big brother’s fine. Next time, don’t risk yourself for me, okay?”

Long Baobei nodded vaguely, dragging Qinglin Snake into the room. “Big brother, I heard snake gall is nutritious. Should I take Qinglin’s gall out to give you some?”

“Hiss…” Qinglin Snake writhed in Long Baobei’s grip, its eyes filled with human-like terror as it gazed at Luo Tian.

Jiang Nanxuan and Meng Yao’s mouths twitched. Upon hearing Long Baobei’s words, they glared at him and Luo Tian. Jiang Nanxuan suddenly regretted keeping Luo Tian.

Seeing Jiang Nanxuan’s hostile gaze, Luo Tian chuckled: “Never mind; I’m fine. In a few days, I’ll take you somewhere fun!”

“Hmph!” Long Baobei nodded innocently, prompting everyone to laugh.

For the next few days, Luo Tian remained in the bamboo grove courtyard. He recovered from his physical wounds while learning to play chess and sipping tea with Jiang Nanxuan, enjoying an unprecedented peace.

Yet for other disciples of the Yuling Sect, it was far from tranquil. First, the sect’s elders returned to their quarters in trepidation. Cang Hongcai had recently reclaimed power, promoting several Bone-Subjugation Peak disciples to elder positions.

Meanwhile, over the past days, every respected disciple of Yuling Sect had visited Luo Tian to show respect. Luo Tian was not stingy, giving each visitor a fourth-rank elixir with seven-tenths of plant energy. This drew the attention of Yuling Sect’s elder alchemists, who frequently approached Luo Tian to discuss elixir arts. Luo Tian’s title of “Young Master” was now fully recognized within the sect, old and young alike.

Unavoidably, Long Baobei and Zheng Xin became a source of trouble. Zheng Xin’s behavior was peculiar; she bonded closely with Long Baobei, leading them to “run amok” through the sect. They stole shiny objects from disciples’ chambers and courtyards, causing great distress among Yuling Sect members.

One day, Luo Tian was playing chess with Jiang Nanxuan when Long Baobei and Zheng Xin sneaked into the courtyard.

As Zheng Xin entered, her jade token glowed faintly, prompting her to retrieve it. Soon after, her face paled slightly.

Chapter 397: Zheng Xin’s Troubles

Zheng Xin held the glowing jade token, dodging Long Baobei’s greedy hands. Her face bore a bitter expression before quickly returning to normal.

“Haha… Luo Tian, Nanxuan Brother, today we’ve made a big haul! Let me tell you…” Zheng Xin’s face lit up as she boasted to them.

Long Baobei chimed in, his face proud, drooling over the full storage bag at his waist.

Luo Tian smiled. Over these days with Jiang Nanxuan, he felt an unusual tranquility. His negative emotions seemed to vanish, and he sensed that if he stayed a month longer, he’d become as composed as Jiang Nanxuan.

Even hearing Zheng Xin’s chatter, Luo Tian no longer felt the old impatience. Though still slightly uncomfortable, he could now calmly face it and grasp the main points of her words.

“I’ll tell you two, Shen Shixiong’s place was really tough to get into. But that didn’t stop me and Long Baobei. We first…” Zheng Xin boasted about their exploits with a smug grin.

“Zheng Xin, you bastard! Come out here!” A cold voice echoed through the bamboo grove.

“Did you steal from me?” A shadow flickered, and a fragrant breeze swept over. Before Zheng Xin could react, she was kicked in the ribs.

Luo Tian recognized the figure instantly—Leng Qiuchan.

Understanding Zheng Xin and Long Baobei’s antics, Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan grimaced.

“Long Baobei, come here!” Luo Tian pulled Long Baobei forward, his face wary. He regretted letting Long Baobei stay with Zheng Xin.

Zheng Xin, seeing Luo Tian’s wary gaze, realized his thoughts and protested: “Luo Tian, it’s not what you think. It was Long Baobei who…”

“Pap!” Before Zheng Xin finished, Leng Qiuchan kicked him again. “Hand over what you stole from me!”

“Ah… it’s on Long Baobei,” Zheng Xin said, looking like he was about to cry.

Leng Qiuchan turned to Long Baobei, who was eyeing everyone with a cunning look. His innocent face and mischievous demeanor made him seem like a different child altogether.

Despite this, no one could stay angry at him. Even Leng Qiuchan smiled faintly. “Long Baobei, do you like my things?”

“Y-yes…” Long Baobei’s face lit up, nodding excitedly.

“Don’t steal next time. If you want something, just ask me. I’ll give it to you directly! Stay away from Zheng Xin, or I’ll reseal you and make you sleep again!” Leng Qiuchan’s face softened as she patted Long Baobei’s head.

“Zheng Xin Big Brother is nice! He took me to those bad guys’ hideouts last time. We got a lot there!” Long Baobei said excitedly.

Hearing this, Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan’s gazes darkened toward Zheng Xin.

“Long Baobei, stay away from this Zheng Xin, or I’ll reseal you and make you sleep again!”

“I…” Zheng Xin’s face twisted with bitterness, about to speak.

“Don’t ‘I’ me! From now on, stay three zhang away!” Luo Tian cut him off with a shout.

“Enough,” Jiang Nanxuan’s calm voice rang out, as if imbued with magic. The group fell silent instantly.

“Zheng Xin Brother, speak up,” Jiang Nanxuan said calmly.

Luo Tian and others smiled at Zheng Xin, having noticed his unease for a while. Though he masked it well, everyone saw the faint sorrow in his eyes.

“Speak up. What’s wrong? Let us help,” Luo Tian patted Zheng Xin’s shoulder gently.

“Sigh… there’s nothing to hide. I need to go home these days because my fiancée is coming!” Zheng Xin sighed, his face grim.

“Fiancée?” Luo Tian’s expression turned puzzled. He hadn’t expected Zheng Xin to have one.

But soon, he understood. Zheng Xin was in his twenties; though cultivation knew no time, it wasn’t strange for someone of his age to marry.

“Ah!” Leng Qiuchan’s face showed sudden realization.

“What, is there some hidden meaning?” Luo Tian looked confused, unaware of what Leng Qiuchan and the others meant.

Hearing Luo Tian’s question, Zheng Xin recounted the entire story under his puzzled gaze, leaving Luo Tian enlightened.

It turned out that when Zheng Xin was young, the Valley Master of Fengfeng Valley, Cang Hongcai, had arranged a betrothal between Zheng Xin and the daughter of another sect in Kunlun—Dan Sect.

Only a prestigious sect could catch Cang Hongcai’s eye. Dan Sect was one of Kunlun’s top powers, its overall strength even surpassing Tianjian Sect and matching Yuling Sect closely.

Dan Sect was entirely composed of alchemists, its strength slightly lacking but its alchemical influence unmatched. Nearly 80% of Kunlun’s alchemists dreamed of joining Dan Sect, making it a sacred site for alchemists.

Zheng Xin’s fiancée was Dan Sect’s Grandmaster, Duan Yuyan.

This wasn’t strange; Zheng Xin’s status in Fengfeng Valley made their match suitable. Yet Duan Yuyan had never liked Zheng Xin, ignoring him after a single meeting.

Zheng Xin hadn’t taken it seriously. If she didn’t like him, that was fine—after all, they’d only met once and shared no deep bond.

This would have been fine in ordinary families, but for Fengfeng Valley and Dan Sect, it was problematic. Both were powerful enough to shake Kunlun with a single move. If one proposed breaking the engagement, it would insult the other. Thus, both found themselves in an awkward situation, too embarrassed to bring up the topic.

Chapter 398: Departing for Fengfeng Valley

Hearing Zheng Xin’s story, Luo Tian felt a mix of amusement and exasperation. To force children to marry someone they disliked for the sake of sect prestige was absurd.

“This time, Dan Sect’s arrival must be about the engagement. I wonder what my father will do. Clearly, Dan Sect is under pressure and wants to break the engagement. Then I’ll be the one embarrassed, as well as my father and the entire sect!” Zheng Xin sighed.

“Why didn’t you propose breaking it earlier?” Luo Tian asked, confused.

“Propose? You don’t know Dan Sect’s lunatics—they value face more than life. If Zheng Xin proposed, the two sects would immediately clash. Though Fengfeng Valley isn’t afraid of Dan Sect, if they fought back fiercely, Fengfeng Valley would be crippled!” Leng Qiuchan coldly replied.

“Then there’s no choice but to let you all be embarrassed!” Luo Tian patted Zheng Xin’s shoulder sympathetically.

“Ah, Qiuchan Sister, since you’re close to Duan Yuyan, could you at least give me some face?” Zheng Xin approached Leng Qiuchan with a sly grin.

Hearing this, Leng Qiuchan’s face darkened. Zheng Xin had omitted one thing—only he, Duan Yuyan, and Leng Qiuchan knew it.

It was that Zheng Xin, in his youth, had stormed into Duan Yuyan’s room after she rejected him, confronting her. But he’d walked in while she was bathing, angering her permanently.

Leng Qiuchan and Duan Yuyan were close; it was only because of this that Leng Qiuchan knew about Duan Yuyan’s visit.

“This is difficult,” Leng Qiuchan said, her face troubled. Though Duan Yuyan and she were close, Zheng Xin’s situation had also improved over the days. Yet this matter was too delicate for outsiders to meddle in.

“If you help me, I promise not to speak three words in front of you!” Zheng Xin’s face hardened.

Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan exchanged glances, surprised. They knew Zheng Xin’s nature—without speaking, it was like taking his life. Now he’d made such a vow, clearly showing how serious this matter was.

“Clearly, there’s more to it,” they thought, exchanging glances. They knew Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin were hiding something but didn’t press further; friendship was friendship, and everyone had secrets.

“I’ll try my best. I’ll help if I can,” Leng Qiuchan said, her face pained. “But given Yuyan’s personality, it’ll be hard.”

“Sigh…” Zheng Xin sighed deeply, gazing into the bamboo grove with contemplation.

“You could let Luo Tian accompany you. After all, he’s an alchemist; maybe he’ll be of use!” Leng Qiuchan smiled slightly, her gaze shifting to Luo Tian.

“Uh…” Hearing Leng Qiuchan shift the topic to himself, Luo Tian was startled. He couldn’t fathom how he could help in this matter.

“Hm?” Zheng Xin seemed to consider it, knowing Luo Tian was a prodigy among his peers. Yet this matter was truly challenging.

“Let’s try our luck; maybe it’ll work!” Zheng Xin sighed inwardly, gazing at Luo Tian.

Seeing Zheng Xin’s gaze, Luo Tian knew he couldn’t escape this journey. He chuckled wryly, patting Long Baobei’s head: “Don’t look at me like that. It’s not like I did anything to you. Well, let’s take Long Baobei out for a trip!”

“Haha! Finally going out to play!” Long Baobei’s eyes sparkled, shouting excitedly.

“Enough, enough! Stop the noise!” Luo Tian indulgently patted Long Baobei’s head to stop his antics.

“Let’s go. I’ll inform my father first, then we can depart. But this time, no flying dragon!” Leng Qiuchan said softly, leading Luo Tian and Zheng Xin to Cang Hongcai’s residence.

Jiang Nanxuan and Meng Yao stayed behind, watching the group leave.

“Envious…” Jiang Nanxuan’s face showed a hint of envy, speaking softly.

“Nanxuan, I’ve held you back for years,” Meng Yao’s face bore a trace of guilt. She knew why Jiang Nanxuan couldn’t cultivate; if not for her, he wouldn’t have been inferior to any genius.

“Don’t worry. I’m fine. This is good enough,” Jiang Nanxuan gently pulled Meng Yao into his arms, a serene expression on his face.

As Luo Tian’s group left, the bamboo grove returned to peace, with only Jiang Nanxuan and Meng Yao embracing within it.

……

The next morning, Luo Tian appeared in the bamboo grove with Long Baobei. The day before, they’d informed Cang Hongcai and each returned to prepare.

Cang Hongcai hadn’t thought much of it; after all, Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin were the golden treasures of Kunlun’s sects. No one dared offend them, except for the previous incident where Tianshi Sect had kidnapped core disciples of three sects.

After meeting in the bamboo grove, they bid farewell to Jiang Nanxuan and Meng Yao before leaving Yuling Sect.

They hadn’t wanted a mount, but when they chose one, Long Baobei insisted on accompanying. Yuling Sect relied on communicating with fierce beasts to command them in battle.

Yet, when the fierce beasts saw Long Baobei, they all crouched on the ground, too afraid to look up. Even mounts were no exception.

The three had no choice but to walk, though their Bone-Subjugation-level cultivation made them fast. As soon as they left Yuling Sect, their figures vanished from the mountain’s edge.

Not long after Luo Tian’s group exited Yuling Sect, a black figure slipped out like a ghost and followed them.

“Luo Tian?” The shadow murmured, then vanished, chasing after Luo Tian’s group.

Chapter 399: Assassination

Kunlun Mountain, known as a divine land by the outside world, was revered.

Fengfeng Valley lay in Kunlun’s east and was called a forbidden land, filled with wind for miles. Ordinary people dared not enter its outer limits. The renowned first sect of Kunlun, Fengfeng Valley, was built far beyond the valley.

Luoyang Town was the closest town to Fengfeng Valley. Though distant from the deadly region, it suffered constant sandstorms and barren land, with few residents.

At this moment, three youths and a child entered the town, their faces marked by exhaustion. One woman wore a black veil, unshaken by the fierce sandstorms.

The other two were youths; one smiled constantly, speaking to the other and the veiled woman. The other wore a faint smile, listening intently while gazing into the distance.

The child, lively and alert, looked around with curious eyes, as if searching for something interesting. But upon finding nothing but wind and sand, his face fell in disappointment.

These two men and one woman were Luo Tian and Leng Qiuchan’s group departing for Fengfeng Valley.

“Luo Tian, I’ll tell you—after a few hundred miles, we reach Fengfeng Valley. Once there, I’ll introduce you to my two brothers; they always boast about their strength…” Zheng Xin smiled, shouting loudly at Luo Tian to ensure the wind didn’t muffle his words.

Luo Tian was visiting this legendary deadly region for the first time. Gazing at the swirling sandstorms, he sighed: “This is just outside Fengfeng Valley. The storms are already this fierce. If we entered the valley, even a powerful cultivator would struggle! I admire those ancestors who built their sect here—what immense cultivation must they have had!”

Meanwhile, a black-cloaked youth with a cold face followed Luo Tian’s group closely, his lips curling into a smile.

“Hm?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, scanning thousands of feet around with his spiritual sense.

But soon, he felt disappointed; the spiritual sense revealed only sand and no other presence.

“Strange?” Luo Tian’s mind puzzled. He’d felt a faint sense of danger throughout the journey, but each time he checked with his spiritual sense, nothing was found. He didn’t believe his powerful spiritual sense would miss something that caused such a feeling.

“What’s wrong?” Leng Qiuchan noticed Luo Tian’s unease and asked softly.

“Nothing.”

“Let’s rest here tonight. Tomorrow, with our speed, we’ll reach it,” Luo Tian gave Leng Qiuchan a reassuring glance.

Long Baobei looked around the group’s back, finding nothing strange before skipping after them.

Luoyang Town was small but the gateway to Fengfeng Valley, often visited by explorers. This ensured the town’s residents had a livelihood.

By dusk, they found an inn and stayed. The journey’s exhaustion relaxed their tense nerves.

Luo Tian and Long Baobei shared a room, while Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin each had their own. After discussing departure times, they returned to their rooms for rest.

Entering his room, Long Baobei looked around but found nothing special, then fell asleep immediately. Soon, drool flowed from his mouth.

Luo Tian smiled, gently wiping Long Baobei’s lips before turning around. His heart jolted as a powerful killing intent surged into his mind.

“Don’t let your friends be harmed—come out yourself. Beyond a hundred miles of this town, otherwise one of them will die!”

A cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, shaking him.

“An enemy stronger than Yang Huanyu!” This voice’s arrival made Luo Tian think quickly. He turned to check Long Baobei, who hadn’t awakened, further shocking him.

Long Baobei, a dragon clan member, had an acute sense of smell. This person had evaded both his scent and Luo Tian’s spiritual sense—either they were skilled in concealment or an elder at the Bone-Subjugation Peak.

“His words suggest he’s after me!” Luo Tian mused, his face resolute. He pushed open the door and stepped onto the town’s street.

The sky had darkened, and Luo Tian dashed away from the town. A hundred miles was enough for him in a quarter-hour, but it was close to Fengfeng Valley. The wind grew stronger, even causing a slight pain on his face.

“Fengfeng Valley truly is deadly! Even from afar, it’s so unbearable. Ordinary Body-Subjugation cultivators couldn’t even enter its edge,” Luo Tian sighed, appearing on a small hill beyond the town.

Though called a hill, it was merely a mound eroded by years of sandstorms.

Luo Tian’s spiritual sense spread instantly, his face puzzled as he gazed around—still no sign of anyone.

“Who is it? Why have you come here?” Luo Tian shouted, his voice barely audible over the wind.

“Huff…” The answer was only swirling sand and roaring winds.

Luo Tian didn’t rush, sitting cross-legged on the hill, letting sandstorms attack him. He knew if he’d arrived, this person wouldn’t remain hidden.

A fierce killing intent suddenly opened Luo Tian’s eyes, scanning around.

“Hiss…” A faint sound echoed, but the wind masked it. Yet Luo Tian’s senses were sharp; in an instant, he leaped several feet away.

“Plop…” Just as Luo Tian vanished, a black spear appeared where he’d sat, plunging into the sand.

Chapter 400: Cultivation

Seeing the spear buried in the ground, Luo Tian’s face turned grave. He’d only evaded it by instinct, not seeing the spear itself.

“Who are you? Show yourself!” Luo Tian shouted again into the wind.

“Shu…” Another black light shot out, and Luo Tian’s mind jolted, vanishing.

The black spear reappeared where he’d stood, but this time, his heightened focus revealed a dark light.

“Good! You’ve evaded my two attacks—your worth is confirmed!” A black figure slowly emerged from Luo Tian’s vision.

Luo Tian looked at the figure, his face puzzled. This youth was clearly young, ordinary in appearance, yet Luo Tian felt a strong threat from him.

Luo Tian’s confusion eased slightly as his spiritual sense scanned the youth, sensing he was at Bone-Subjugation Peak.

“As long as it’s Bone-Subjugation, I have no fear!” Luo Tian muttered, his gaze intense as he held his spear.

“Who are you?” Luo Tian asked coldly.

“You have the right to know my name. They call me ‘Xiu.’ As for my real name, it’s better not to say!” The youth waved his hand, and two dark lights rose from the ground into his hands.

Luo Tian’s mind raced, trying to discern this youth’s identity, but he gave up. He’d offended too many people, each with reasons to kill him.

“Alright, I’ve told you my name. Now it’s time for your life!” The youth vanished from Luo Tian’s sight again.

“Explosive Spirit Pill!” Luo Tian held a black pill, a fourth-rank elixir that briefly elevated spiritual sense. He’d made it in his free time, never expecting to use it.

As he thought of it in that instant, he swallowed the pill without hesitation.

“Boom…” The elixir ignited his mind sea, expanding it by three parts.

Luo Tian felt his mind sea roaring with golden waves, pushing against his consciousness. The golden sea transformed into a powerful spiritual sense, spreading instantly.

“Hundred feet… thousand feet… ten thousand feet…” His spiritual sense expanded to ten thousand feet before stopping.

Feeling his spiritual strength, Luo Tian smiled slightly but soon frowned. His spiritual sense still found no trace of the youth named “Xiu,” as if he’d vanished.

“Hiss…” Killing intent surged, a dark light appearing behind Luo Tian. He jolted, using the “Seal-Blocking Step” to teleport a hundred feet away.

“Squeak…” A shallow wound appeared on his back, making him inhale sharply. He could clearly feel the coldness of the spear. If he’d delayed a moment, it would’ve pierced his heart.

“I won’t find you today! Let’s focus!” Luo Tian roared, his spiritual sense compressing.

This time, it wasn’t spreading but rapidly condensing into a hundred-foot radius.

“I’ve found you!” Luo Tian’s face lit up with joy. His spiritual sense revealed a black disturbance within his hundred feet. If not carefully observed, he’d miss it—this darkness seemed to merge with the night.

“Once I find you, it’s over!” Luo Tian smiled, five golden snakes emerging from his spear. They converged, illuminating the night as they lunged at the spiritual disturbance.

“Hiss…” The golden snakes’ icy fangs bit into the darkness.

But soon, Luo Tian was puzzled. Though he didn’t hope for the golden snakes to harm Xiu, he was surprised they’d bitten into him. Yet it felt like biting air—Xiu’s form dissolved into black mist, vanishing from the snakes’ mouths.

“You truly have skill. I didn’t expect you to find me!” Xiu’s voice echoed through the wind.

“This is just the beginning! Many want to kill me, but you’re nothing special!” Luo Tian’s face showed battle intent. Xiu was the strongest Bone-Subjugation-level opponent he’d faced. Without his spiritual sense boosted by the Explosive Spirit Pill, he would’ve been in danger today.

Five-colored light seals rapidly formed and smashed into Xiu’s spiritual form.

The thunderous sound echoed, but Luo Tian was disappointed—just like the golden snakes, the seals missed. They smashed into the ground instead.

“Star Night Ghost Kill!” As Luo Tian was surprised, a cold voice echoed again.

Luo Tian’s eyes widened. His spiritual sense felt Xiu materializing, his hands gripping spears as he rushed toward him. Two spears, like venomous snakes, pierced at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian was surprised not by Xiu’s speed but by the moment he felt time freeze. He couldn’t move, watching the spears approach.

“Roar…” Luo Tian roared, forcing himself to move slightly and dodge the vital spot. His arm glowed as he met the spears.

“Pap… Pap…” The two spears smashed into Luo Tian’s arm.

“Crack…” Fine cracks formed on his arm, shocking Luo Tian.

“This is too strong! Even a normal attack has damaged my bone. If this continues, I’ll be ruined!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly but ignored his wounded arm, his hands moving rapidly.

Numerous fire dragons erupted from his hands, filling a fifty-foot radius instantly. A moment later, one dragon exploded into fiery sparks, making Luo Tian happy.

“I won’t believe any attack is ineffective!” Luo Tian roared, slapping the ground.

“Boom…” The “Furnace Heaven Fire Array” spread instantly, fire seas rising like a chain reaction. Dragons of fire exploded continuously, forming an endless sea of flames.

“Hundred feet… thousand feet…”

The fire spread to a thousand feet.

Chapter 401: Battle in the Wind

Outside Fengfeng Valley, fire roared skyward, as if setting the entire night ablaze.

“Is it on fire?” The townspeople of Luoyang awoke, their faces filled with awe as they gazed at the light beyond their hundred miles.

“Haha… Big brother, why is it so bright?” Long Baobei yawned, shouting into the empty room.

“Luo Tian, are you there?” Leng Qiuchan’s voice echoed from outside the door, urgent. She had a bad feeling, especially after sensing the firelight.

As Leng Qiuchan knocked on Luo Tian and Long Baobei’s door, Zheng Xin appeared at the door. Seeing Leng Qiuchan, he was momentarily stunned.

“You felt something wrong too? I always feel this firelight is familiar,” Zheng Xin said, his face grim.

“Creak…” As they spoke, the door opened, revealing Long Baobei’s small figure.
