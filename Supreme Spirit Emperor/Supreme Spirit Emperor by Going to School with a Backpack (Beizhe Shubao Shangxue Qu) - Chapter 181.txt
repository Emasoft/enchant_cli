“Alas, you can only halt at the threshold of transcendence!” Luo Tian’s cold laughter interrupted Sha Cangmang, his hand clenching fiercely.

At this moment, Luo Tian’s body was wreathed in golden inscriptions, radiating a blinding golden light. With a single strike, the Transcendent Altar trembled violently. Those who had been attuning to Original Power—Ren Hongzhe, Chen Xuanning—suddenly opened their eyes, their gazes filled with shock.

In the wake of Luo Tian’s strike, they were stunned to find their attunement to Original Power had vanished entirely.

Sha Cangmang’s mocking laughter abruptly ceased, for he felt his nine凝聚 Original Powers halt mid-formation. His cultivation power froze, no longer ascending.

“Come forth!” Luo Tian roared, his hand tearing at the air. The Altar erupted with blinding golden light, forcing people to squint their eyes.

Golden light surged forth, and a golden scroll was yanked from the ground beneath them.

“This is the original Golden Scripture!” Sha Cangmang’s mind reeled, his face contorted with disbelief. He had never imagined Luo Tian could extract this scroll from the Transcendent Altar.

Sha Cangmang knew the scroll’s terrifying power—once it had suppressed Heaven’s Will itself. Yet now, Luo Tian had torn it free.

“This is my destined boon,” Luo Tian said, tossing the golden scroll into the air. His Original Power flowed outward, merging with the inscriptions that spiraled from the scroll.

A cascade of golden inscriptions merged with Luo Tian’s own, wrapping around his body before sinking into his flesh.

Meanwhile, the golden scroll shrank rapidly under the crowd’s astonished gaze, finally vanishing into Luo Tian’s mind.

Sha Cangmang and the others stared at Luo Tian, his body aglow with golden light. They could not fathom this ending—had they not expected a grueling battle? Yet Luo Tian, the true master of the golden scroll, had seized the prize.

“Such a relic could subdue Heaven itself! Luo Tian has mastered it—this is a fortune spanning lifetimes!” Dou Jiande, who had witnessed the scroll’s terror, murmured in awe.

The elder disciples of Qinglong Sect nodded solemnly, their eyes alight with admiration. Though they had only briefly attuned to Original Power, this was still a boon beyond measure. They would surely enter the Nine Sources within a year.

Nan Gong Yuting and others watched Luo Tian seated in midair, his eyes closed in meditation. A flicker of respect crossed their gazes.

“This is mine! Mine! You’ll hand it over soon!” Sun Xinghuo’s face twisted with madness.

Luo Tian, however, felt unusually at ease. The golden scroll floated in his mind, calm and unassuming.

The inscriptions that had entered his body now coiled around his Nine Original Powers, forming nine serpentine dragons. They rotated in strange harmony, gradually converging.

“Rumbling...” The sound of thunder echoed from Luo Tian’s dantian as the Nine Original Powers collided. Lightning crackled, striking his core relentlessly.

“Hiss…” Luo Tian inhaled sharply, sweat trickling down his brow.

“Nine Sources Converge!” Luo Tian bellowed, and the entire Fengshen Continent trembled. The land’s countless残魂 wailed, their desperate thoughts surging toward the Transcendent Altar.

Beneath the River of Death, the massive form of a ghostly beast shifted restlessly. Its eight eyes widened in disbelief: “Someone has reached Transcendence!”

Sha Cangmang’s group exchanged grim looks. They knew Luo Tian had become the greatest victor of this journey.

As Luo Tian’s Nine Original Powers completed their fusion, his dantian no longer held nine separate forces but a black vortex, devouring surrounding energy like an abyss.

His eyes snapped open, glowing like twin suns. He clenched his fists; fissures of space and blue lightning crackled between his fingers.

“I, Luo Tian, have now transcended!” He swung a fist, its force threatening to pierce the heavens of Fengshen Continent.

The explosive energy surged outward, striking the continent’s outer barrier. The vast barrier shuddered violently.

“Again!” Luo Tian unleashed another Killing God Fist, its intent slamming into the barrier.

A sharp crack echoed through the air, sending Sha Cangmang and Chen Xuanning into panic.

“Stop!” Sha Cangmang and Xuanwu Elder roared. If Luo Tian shattered the barrier, the残魂 would escape Fengshen Continent—unleashing a catastrophe upon the Four Sacred Starfields.

Yet Luo Tian ignored their cries, striking again. The thunderous roar echoed once more, and Sha Cangmang and Chen Xuanning’s eyes darkened with despair.

Luo Tian’s strength was unquestionably the greatest among them. They felt like commoners before him, even united; they could not match his might.

Lightning crackled as the barrier shattered under Luo Tian’s fist, fragments scattering into space.

“The Fengshen Continent’s barrier is broken!” A Qinglong Sect elder, who had been scoured by Luo Tian earlier, gaped in terror, staring at the mist-veiled continent.

“End… it’s over!” Qinglong and Xuanwu Sect disciples cried, fleeing in panic. They knew the残魂’s terror.

“Roar…” A low growl erupted from their throats, sending the sect disciples into a frenzy. Their speed increased further.

“Luo Tian, you’ve caused chaos!” Xuanwu Elder’s face burned with anger.

To see the usually composed Xuanwu Elder so enraged showed how grievous Luo Tian’s actions were.

“Don’t worry, Master. I have a plan,” Luo Tian smiled reassuringly, gesturing to Xuanwu Elder and Chen Xuanning.

As he spoke, Luo Tian’s hand grasped a black soul banner. The banner fluttered without wind, planted in the void.

“Sages of Tianyuan… today I have transcended. I come to fulfill my promise, leading you home!” Luo Tian’s voice carried reverence as he bowed to the残魂. His words echoed across Fengshen Continent.

“Home…” The low growls of the残魂 rose, and they surged skyward, rushing toward Luo Tian’s soul banner.

Chapter 838: Sun Mingtian (Sun Mingtian)

Since Luo Tian’s departure, the Tianyuan Continent had remained sealed. At the moment he ascended to Transcendence, those close to him—those bound by fate—glowed with radiant light.

Though still sealed, their eyes gleamed with vitality, and their consciousnesses gradually returned.

“What’s happening? Why have I regained awareness but remain immobile?” Luonantian and his wife exchanged silent thoughts, scanning their surroundings. Many others were in the same state.

The entire Ice Pole Luo family glowed with light, as if transformed.

Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan shimmered with brilliance, their eyes filled with confusion.

“What’s happening? Is the seal breaking?” Most who regained consciousness whispered anxiously, their voices tinged with urgency. The once-silent Tianyuan Continent was unnervingly still, yet people exchanged murmurs about this strange phenomenon.

“Ugh, being sealed is better than this! At least it’s mindless. Standing here like an idiot is unbearable!”

“Right, who says otherwise? At least we can chat now. If we couldn’t even speak, I’d have gone mad!”

“But why do I feel something’s changed? Did I get more handsome?”

“Shut up…” A chorus of chatter filled the void, their boredom unrelenting.

——
On Fengshen Continent, Luo Tian stood in the sky as残魂 swarmed him like madmen. The black soul banner flapped, its void-like pull swallowing each残魂.

“One million… two million…” An hour passed before the final Nine Sources残魂 gazed at Luo Tian with gratitude, then vanished into the banner. Fengshen Continent now held no more残魂 of Tianyuan.

The barrier shattered, and sunlight filtered through, bringing a faint vitality to the land once filled with death.

The Transcendent Altar beneath their feet changed—its golden inscriptions gone, now a massive stone platform. Yet it still pulsed with inscriptions and an immense aura.

“What lies beneath this altar?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, sensing something formidable sealed below.

Others felt the same eerie presence but attributed it to Luo Tian’s unstable Transcendence power.

Yet Luo Tian cared little; he needed a worthy opponent to test his strength.

A mocking grin spread across his face as he locked eyes with the dozen神族 youths: “You said you’d kill me. Now I’m here—dare you?”

“Dare you?” Luo Tian’s voice thundered through the神族 youths, their faces paling instantly. Some Seventh Source Celestial Emperors spat blood.

Sun Xinghuo’s face darkened with fury—this was his boon. If not for Luo Tian, he would be the one standing atop the sky.

Yet Sun Xinghuo dared not speak out. Transcendence was a top-tier power even in the Divine Beast Domain. A Transcendence clan could thrive there. His status as a神族 genius had let him dominate, even top-tier masters respected him.

But this was the Four Sacred Starfields—no one cared about his神族 heritage. With his history with Luo Tian and the rumors of Luo Tian’s ruthlessness, he’d killed神族 before. He wouldn’t hesitate now.

“Die!” Nan Gong Yuting lunged without hesitation, having long prepared to strike the神族. But he’d held back, fearing Luo Tian’s safety. Now that Luo Tian had ascended to Transcendence, these神族 scum would not escape.

Nan Gong Yuting’s blood-red sword surged toward Sun Xinghuo, while Ren Hongzhe and Tu Hongfei followed suit.

“Who do you think you are to kill us?” A神族 youth sneered, drawing a golden sword. It slashed toward Nan Gong Yuting.

“Indeed, you’re卑劣. Numbers and strength don’t match—yet you dare to kill? Return for another few centuries!” The神族 youths mocked, their bodies glowing with golden light.

They were神族 geniuses, unchallenged in the Divine Beast Domain. Even top-tier masters feared them. They saw Luo Tian’s Transcendence as nothing special.

“Die!” Sun Xinghuo saw the神族 youths’ disdain and knew their thoughts.

Luo Tian stood in the sky, watching the神族 youths’ arrogance with a smile. He pointed his finger, and an immense pressure descended upon them.

“Crack…” The gray ground shattered under the pressure, and the神族 youths’ feet crumbled. They nearly collapsed, their faces flushed red.

“Luo Tian, spare us! From now on, you and the神族 will be separate!” Sun Xinghuo sweat profusely, his legs trembling as he resisted the pressure.

“Boom… boom…” Before Sun Xinghuo finished speaking, six blood mists erupted under the gazes of Sha Cangmang and Xuanwu Elder.

Nan Gong Yuting and Li Tianzhi, along with Tu Hongfei, appeared before the神族 youths instantly. Their attacks struck without mercy.

The神族 youths were paralyzed by Luo Tian’s pressure, unable to move. Facing Nan Gong Yuting’s ferocity, they fell in a single breath, dying under his sword and techniques.

“You said you’d kill me before! Now I’ve ascended to Transcendence, and you can’t match me. You神族 are all proud! You said all races were卑劣—today let us lowly ones kill you!” Luo Tian’s voice carried coldness.

“Luo Tian, know this—angering the神族 brings no good!” Sun Xinghuo saw Luo Tian’s cold gaze and knew this wouldn’t end easily. Yet he had a trump card: his Transcendence uncle Sun Mingtian hadn’t arrived yet. If he did, they’d have no fear of Luo Tian.

Sun Xinghuo’s goal now was to stall, even for a breath—anything could change.

But Nan Gong Yuting wouldn’t grant him time. His blood-red sword hummed, slicing through the motionless Seventh Source神族 youth before streaking toward Sun Xinghuo.

Ren Hongzhe and others wasted no time, summoning weapons and techniques to attack the remaining motionless神族 youths.

“Hundred feet… ten feet…” In an instant, Nan Gong Yuting’s blood-red sword appeared before Sun Xinghuo.

“Fumu Sword!” Sun Xinghuo’s eyes widened in shock at the sword. “You’re a demon clan! How dare you attack me!”

“Kill you, what’s the issue?” Nan Gong Yuting’s voice was like ice. His sword pierced Sun Xinghuo’s chest.

At that moment, a cold hum echoed into Nan Gong Yuting’s ears from afar. His body shuddered; the sword paused slightly in Sun Xinghuo’s chest.

In that pause, the pressure from Luo Tian vanished, freeing Sun Xinghuo.

Sun Xinghuo’s eyes lit with joy, his Original Power surging as he retreated.

“Uncle!” Sun Xinghuo’s face showed relief, exhaling deeply. His chest felt cold, but he was grateful for his uncle’s timely arrival—otherwise, it would have been dangerous.

Not only Sun Xinghuo, but the other神族 youths also regained freedom, retreating from Ren Hongzhe’s attacks.

Yet three were too slow, dying at Li Tianzhi and Tu Hongfei’s hands. The remaining escaped with injuries.

“Transcendence!” Luo Tian ignored the ground’s chaos, his brow furrowed as he gazed at a middle-aged man approaching from afar.

“Unexpectedly, the Four Sacred Starfields—long dormant—has birthed a Transcendence!” The man’s face was calm as he stepped forward, appearing in Luo Tian’s view.

——
Chapter 839: Battle Against Transcendence

Luo Tian stood on Fengshen Continent’s sky, his face grim as he faced the middle-aged man with a calm expression.

“It’s him!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, recognizing the神族 youth he’d slain before.

Now seeing his true form, Luo Tian’s expression turned cautious. Though he had ascended to Transcendence, his power was still unstable.

The opponent, however, had long mastered Transcendence.

“Unexpectedly, you’ve reached Transcendence so quickly—unbelievable!” The man smiled, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Fight! No more words!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed coldly, his spear—Lietian—drawn as he awaited Sun Mingtian’s attack.

“Cultivation is arduous. I’ll give you one last chance—surrender, and take the previous神族 Empress back. The神族 is merciful; we’ll overlook this!” The man spoke calmly, looking down at Luo Tian.

“Haha, is that mercy? Perhaps in others’ eyes, you神族 are supreme. But I must say—your entire race, including you and your god, is trash! Even worse than trash!” Luo Tian spoke slowly, emphasizing “trash.”

“Then I’ll have to kill you! The神族 cannot be insulted. Remember, you died at the hands of神族 Sun Mingtian—this is your honor!” Sun Mingtian’s smile remained, his hand striking.

Though the strike seemed light, it carried world-destroying power. A mountain-sized handprint formed instantly, crushing toward Luo Tian.

“Transcendence is so powerful!” Sha Cangmang and Xuanwu Elder’s eyes widened in awe, silently calculating if they could survive the strike.

“Don’t hold back—this won’t harm me!” Luo Tian sneered, his dantian’s black vortex spinning rapidly. Transcendence power gathered in his hand as he pointed a finger, sending golden light toward Sun Mingtian’s palm.

“Boom…” The clash of hand and finger erupted, shaking the gray sky. A thunderous roar echoed in people’s ears, halting Nan Gong Yuting’s attempt to strike Sun Xinghuo.

In awe, Luo Tian’s golden finger pierced Sun Mingtian’s hand, directly targeting him.

Though the hand was pierced, its power diminished slightly, it still reached Luo Tian’s body, striking him.

Luo Tian’s body glowed with blue light, dragons roaring as he took two steps back. He sighed inwardly at Sun Mingtian’s strength.

“With my physique, I could have crushed peers easily. Though newly ascended to Transcendence, my power is unstable. Yet I was pushed back by one strike—this Sun Mingtian isn’t ordinary!” Luo Tian mused, watching Sun Mingtian’s slight shake.

A hum echoed as Lietian appeared in Luo Tian’s hand. Without hesitation, he rushed toward Sun Mingtian.

“Suicide!” Sun Mingtian’s heart glowed with joy. Luo Tian was now Transcendence, but after testing him, Sun Mingtian knew he was weaker. Yet Luo Tian could escape if he chose.

Now, Luo Tian’s advance was what Sun Mingtian desired most.

A sword’s cry rang out, as if seizing a sun. Sun Mingtian transformed into golden light, charging toward Luo Tian without fear.

Black and white lights collided in Fengshen Continent’s sky, their power shaking the Transcendent Altar.

Both were Transcendence masters; their clash was earth-shattering. The once chaotic sky grew more so, the heavens churning as stars reflected in people’s eyes.

“This is Transcendence? A realm worth longing for!” Nan Gong Yuting’s group gazed with envy. Even with their spiritual senses, they could only see two streaks of light—too fast to follow.

As for Tu Hongfei, they could only feel the tremors from the clash. If it hit them, it would crush their Seventh or Eighth Source Celestial Emperors.

Sha Cangmang’s face twisted with rage, his heart bitter. The Qinglong Sect’s plan spanning generations had become another’s wedding gift—fulfilling Luo Tian instead. This feeling made Qinglong Sect members’ faces grim, as if they’d eaten dirt.

“Still, the Four Sacred Starfields has finally birthed a Transcendence!” Xuanwu Elder and Chen Xuanning sighed.

Xuanwu had long sensed Luo Tian’s uniqueness but hadn’t expected him to rise so fast. In years, he’d gone from a minor界尊 master to Transcendence—Luo Tian’s future was limitless.

“Fight!” Nan Gong Yuting brandished his Fusu Sword, rushing toward Sun Xinghuo. Though the battle between Luo Tian and Sun Mingtian decided their fate, if Luo Tian lost, they’d all die. If he won, it would be Sun Xinghuo’s end. Nan Gong Yuting disliked fate being controlled by others. Regardless of the outcome, he’d kill Sun Xinghuo now—death was worth it.

Seeing Nan Gong Yuting attack, Sun Xinghuo sneered: “Earlier, I couldn’t fight back under that boy’s pressure. Now, who will kill whom? In my peer group, I’m invincible!”

“Invincible? You dare say that?” Nan Gong Yuting sneered, summoning the Mie Cangqiong Array. Blood-red swords surrounded the神族 youths.

At the same time, Li Tianzhi and Tu Hongfei rushed toward the神族 youths with murderous intent. Their cries of battle echoed in Sha Cangmang and Xuanwu Elder’s ears.

Fengshen Continent trembled as the battle began, its waves of power spreading endlessly.

In the sky, Luo Tian and Sun Mingtian clashed again, emerging from a fractured void. Both were pale, panting heavily. Their wounds healed instantly, returning to their original state in a blink.

Though the fight was brief, they had clashed multiple times. Luo Tian suffered minor injuries but no real harm—his form was slightly disheveled compared to Sun Mingtian’s.

“End you!” Sun Mingtian felt Luo Tian’s power stabilizing and knew he couldn’t delay. If Luo Tian’s strength fully stabilized, it would be him who suffered.

“Fumu Three Swords!” Sun Mingtian roared, his golden sword glowing with light. He chanted seals, golden inscriptions flying from his hands and attaching to the sword.

“Hum…” The golden inscriptions merged into the sword, which expanded like a blazing sun. A terrifying purification power radiated from it, ready to split Fengshen Continent in two as it rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Fumu? Then I’ll become a demon! Let’s see how you subdue me!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed black, his body engulfed in dark mist. His dantian’s black vortex reversed instantly, roaring with power.

Black lightning surged from Luo Tian’s body, as if a demon lord had descended. Black mist and lightning flooded his body.

Luo Tian’s Transcendence aura surged again, even overwhelming Sun Mingtian.

“Crack…” He clenched his fists; a black demon sword materialized in his hand.

“Indeed, the demon clan’s sage created this technique. Even Transcendence masters gain a boost. Though not reaching half-Saint level, it’s far stronger than ordinary Transcendence!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed. If he had no chance before, now he was confident to subdue Sun Mingtian—only because of the demon technique’s power.

“What technique is this? It boosts his strength so much!” Sun Mingtian panicked, sensing Luo Tian’s overwhelming aura. He realized he was no longer a match for Luo Tian.

In Sun Mingtian’s hesitation, Luo Tian’s black demon sword rose high and slashed the fourth of the Seven Demon Swords.

The dark blade, brimming with arrogance, clashed with Sun Mingtian’s sword energy. Thunder crackled as black and white light beams collided, consuming each other.

“Again!” Luo Tian’s long hair flew as he roared, his black demon sword slicing the fourth of Seven Demon Swords.

A mistake was made—Li Tianzhi’s name was incorrectly written. Li Tianzhi, please forgive this error. As compensation, I’ll give you more scenes in the future…

——
Chapter 840: The神族’s Sacred Beasts

Fengshen Continent, Luo Tian’s long hair flew as dark mist enveloped him. His black demon sword slashed forth, the fourth of Seven Demon Swords striking Sun Mingtian.

The dark blade cleaved through the sky, shattering space with a hum. Black lightning crackled around it, instantly reaching Sun Mingtian’s position.

Luo Tian was now a Transcendence master; the fourth of Seven Demon Swords no longer felt burdensome. Though not effortless, it cost him little.

Feeling the approaching dark blade, Sun Mingtian’s eyes finally changed. He raised his golden sword, shouting: “Fumu Three Swords—Third Strike!”

Sun Mingtian couldn’t afford to be careless. He felt if he was reckless, he’d suffer heavy injuries. Thus, he unleashed the third strike of Fumu Three Swords.

“Hum…” The golden sword pierced through the sky, a pillar of light. Its purification power instantly erased the previous clashes between swords and blades.

“Go…” Sun Mingtian’s bloodshot eyes glared, his massive sword rushing toward Luo Tian’s fourth strike.

In Sun Mingtian’s awe, the blade and sword collided again. The sky darkened instantly, as if plunging into endless night. Fengshen Continent held only one blazing sword beam standing between heaven and earth.

Luo Tian and Sun Mingtian’s clash even halted Nan Gong Yuting’s attacks, their gazes filled with fear at the dark sky.

“Crack…” A thunderous sound echoed in their ears, shaking them to the core.

In their vision, Sun Mingtian’s sword beam shattered, fragments scattering like stars across the horizon. Some shards landed on the golden-inscribed Transcendent Altar, embedding into its solid surface.

Wind howled as invisible waves formed terrifying storms, sweeping over Nan Gong Yuting, Sha Cangmang, and Xuanwu Elder. Their bodies swayed slightly.

“This is Transcendence—its waves even affect Ninth Source Celestial Emperors!” Xuanwu Elder’s face bore nostalgia. As the oldest living beast of Four Sacred Starfields, he had witnessed Transcendence clashes before.

The terrifying waves lasted dozens of breaths before fading. The sky gradually returned to its gray state.

Sun Mingtian stepped out of the void, his face pale with bloodstains on his lips. He gazed at Luo Tian, whose black mist swirled around him and who wore a green robe.

“Powerful!” Sun Mingtian hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so strong. He was a renowned master in the Divine Beast Domain, yet now he’d suffered such a heavy loss at a junior’s hands.

His disheveled appearance was forgivable, but the true injury was the black mist in his body and his cultivated sword.

That sword had accompanied him for years, nurtured to become his lifeblood weapon upon reaching Sainthood. Now it was shattered by Luo Tian’s blade, and Sun Mingtian felt the damage.

“Subdue it!” Golden whirlwinds spun wildly, Sun Mingtian’s body glowing with golden light. Purification power surged through him, attempting to subdue the invading black mist.

“Still want to kill me?” Luo Tian held his demon sword, sneering at Sun Mingtian.

After a brief subduing, Sun Mingtian’s face returned to normal. Hearing Luo Tian’s words, he smiled.

“Boy, you think I have no preparations?” Sun Mingtian flexed his bloodied hands, flesh regrowing.

“Huh?” Luo Tian’s face showed confusion as he gazed at Sun Mingtian. He didn’t know what Sun Mingtian’s next move was.

“Hurry and use your tricks! I’ll endure them!” Luo Tian waved his black demon sword, gazing coldly at Sun Mingtian.

“Haha, confidence is good—but the神族’s depth isn’t something a small Four Sacred Starfields boy can comprehend!” Sun Mingtian’s hands emitted waves, golden inscriptions flying from them.

“Do you know why I came to Fengshen Continent?”

“Do you know why this land is called Fengshen?” Sun Mingtian spoke as golden inscriptions rained from the sky.

“Transcendent Altar!” Luo Tian murmured, gazing at Sun Mingtian’s inscriptions falling onto the altar. His voice carried more gravity.

Luo Tian had long suspected something was sealed beneath the Transcendent Altar. Now seeing Sun Mingtian’s inscriptions on it, even a fool would know he intended to open the altar and release what was sealed beneath.

“Is there something hidden under this Transcendent Altar?” Sha Cangmang and Xuanwu Elder’s minds reeled. They hadn’t expected this seemingly useless altar to hold secrets.

As they pondered, Sun Mingtian’s inscriptions completed, landing on the altar. The massive Transcendent Altar transformed into a golden ocean, with inscriptions forming golden dragons coiling around it.

“Come forth! My神族’s sacred beast!” Sun Mingtian roared, his hands slamming onto the altar.

“Hum…” At that moment, the Transcendent Altar echoed with thunderous sounds.
