“Boom… Boom… Boom…” This time, the three golden script dragon formations shattered with a resounding crash.

“Middle-grade divine artifact isn’t enough. Let’s use the upper-grade one. At this point, I should be able to unleash Zhenxian’s Eight Styles!” Luo Tian’s face twisted with madness. At the moment the three golden script dragon formations disintegrated, he felt the Huangquan Water rising slowly—slightly delayed.

Chapter 1921: Dragon-Elephant Sealing Prison

The world was shrouded in black, as if the lower three realms had plunged into apocalyptic despair. Endless darkness filled the heavens and earth, as if day would never return.

In the Forest of Doomsday, yellow泉水 (Huangquan Water) rose slowly amidst black ghosts’ mist. Beneath the dark sky, waves of battle energy constantly surged.

“Zhenxian Brush!” Luo Tian sheathed his Bow of Shooting the Sun, gripping the Zhenxian Brush. His hands moved rapidly, black energy surged violently as a character “Bing” (War) materialized with a thunderous explosion. It descended from the heavens like a thousand ghostly wails, crushing the faceless enemy.

“Tian Ge… Tian Ge… How strong you are…” The battlefield had only Ye Liangchen as a bystander. True Immortal battles were beyond his comprehension, so he could only tremble in fear.

“Master, how did this happen?” Two True Immortals at the initial stage who had escorted Long Youran away returned with grim faces. Without the maze, their speed was naturally swift.

“Those are faceless ghosts. We’re standing on the Departure Gate of Jiuxuan Ghost Sect!” Ye Liangchen stammered, his voice laced with terror. He felt a terrifying power approaching.

“Why is the Departure Gate of Jiuxuan Ghost Sect here!” Upon hearing Ye Liangchen’s words, the two True Immortals’ expressions changed.

“Stop talking nonsense. Go help those four— they’re about to collapse!” Ye Liangchen shouted at the four who were stunned, his gaze turning toward the battlefield.

Although Star River Sect’s four True Immortals at the initial stage were strong, Zheng Tiande was drenched in ghostly mist. His flesh seemed enhanced beyond normal limits, and no matter how the four attacked, they couldn’t harm Zheng Tiande. Instead, they were spitting blood under his blows.

“Form the formation!” The two True Immortals roared, their bodies flashing as they joined the battle. Their figures radiated intense brilliance.

“Finally arrived! If you came any later, we’d have collapsed!” The four True Immortals at the initial stage looked pale, their bodies also radiating starlight. Six of them surrounded Zheng Tiande, and一道道神则 (Divine Laws) flew from their hands, striking Zheng Tiande’s body.

“Ah…” Zheng Tiande howled into the sky, his black mist thickening. He waved his hands continuously, repelling the six’s attacks.

“Star-Encircling Sealing!” The six True Immortals at the initial stage struck again. Green script patterns flashed, surrounding Zheng Tiande and temporarily immobilizing him.

The star patterns danced across Zheng Tiande’s body, splitting into six streams connecting to the hands of the six True Immortals. The six let out long sighs.

“Master, you should leave first. We’ve already trapped him. Take this chance to escape!” The six True Immortals at the initial stage shouted, their voices laced with death.

They knew even if they trapped this True Immortal at the intermediate stage, it wouldn’t change their fate. The faceless enemy was the real threat. If it recovered, they would all die.

“Impossible! You came out with me—you must return together!” Ye Liangchen shouted, his voice resolute. He had abandoned his previous spoiled demeanor.

“Master!” The six True Immortals stared at Ye Liangchen’s expression, expecting him to flee immediately.

“What do you mean ‘what’? Can’t you see Tian Ge is still there. We’re temporarily safe!” Ye Liangchen drew a star sword, his hands forming seals. The sword glowed brilliantly as he stabbed toward Zheng Tiande.

“Buzz…” On the other side, Luo Tian wielded the Zhenxian Brush, moving it rapidly. Golden characters descended one after another.

“Bing, Lin, Dou, Zhe, Du, Zhen, Lie, Zai!” The eight characters exploded with power, each striking the faceless enemy. At last, its featureless face turned toward the sky.

“Buzz…” The eight characters radiated an atmosphere of suppression, causing the entire world to pause. They shattered space and descended slowly.

“Son, you’re seeking death!” The faceless enemy’s cold voice echoed. It was laced with anger and surprise—Luo Tian had become unexpectedly strong.

“Zhenxian Brush, the Zhenxian Eight Styles of the Calligrapher!” Ye Liangchen panted heavily, pushed back by Zheng Tiande’s force.

“Indeed the Zhenxian Eight Styles!” The six True Immortals at the initial stage looked astonished.

“Ah! He used the Bow of Shooting the Sun before. Chang Ziyang, Lang Nuo—those were his kills!” Ye Liangchen suddenly realized. The Bow of Shooting the Sun he had previously displayed was exactly the one Huang Youshan had bought at the Fantasy Auction.

Ye Liangchen and the others also knew that Huang Youshan, Chang Ziyang, and others had died together. Even after they left the middle three realms, those elder-level figures were still searching for the killer of their juniors.

“Is it him…” Ye Liangchen panted, his eyes filled with complex emotions. Chang Ziyang and Lang Xiu had been close to him.

“Buzz…” As Ye Liangchen and the others pondered, the runes beneath their feet began to move wildly.

“Ten… a hundred… a thousand…” Each rune dragon roared, colliding with the eight characters descending.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” The thunderous sound shook all directions. Black rune dragons continuously shattered, transforming into surging ghostly mist that swept outward. Meanwhile, the eight massive characters also exploded violently, their wild winds scattering the thick ghostly mist beneath them.

“Huangquan!” Ye Liangchen and the others saw the rising Huangquan Water, along with its countless ghostly creatures. Their hair stood on end.

“Master, you must leave!” The six True Immortals at the initial stage urged anxiously, watching Ye Liangchen slashing Zheng Tiande with a star sword.

“Leave! We leave together!” Ye Liangchen’s eyes flashed madness. He discarded his broken star sword, drawing a talisman and throwing it at Zheng Tiande.

“Ah… You’ll die! You’ll die!” The faceless ghost screamed wildly. Earlier, Luo Tian’s attack had shattered over a thousand rune dragons, slowing the Huangquan Water’s rise.

“Tian Ge, don’t let the faceless ghost touch the Huangquan Water. The faceless ghost is one of the eight generals of Hell, equivalent to a half-step Immortal King in the celestial realm. His current strength is damaged. If he touches the Huangquan Water and gets nourished, his power will definitely increase!” Ye Liangchen shouted urgently.

“Damn it…” Luo Tian stared at the faceless ghost, struggling to connect this entity with a half-step Immortal King.

Luo Tian also felt his scalp tingle. This faceless ghost was clearly restrained by the black runes, forced to endure without retaliation.

“What do we do? Even the Zhenxian Eight Styles can’t kill it. Do I have to use the Epoch Book?” Luo Tian’s heart raced with anxiety.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian pondered, the black mist that had been eroding his body suddenly surged upward. It spread across his entire body, leaving only his head golden.

“Son, if you don’t suppress and seal it, no one can save you. Unless you don’t want your cultivation!” Maque warned Luo Tian, making his face grim.

“Haha! In thirty more breaths, your soul will be completely devoured!” The faceless ghost’s laughter echoed. His voice was arrogant.

“Long… Xiang… Zhen… Yu…” Luo Tian’s face darkened, but he had no choice but to protect his life.

“Roar…” Luo Tian’s hands moved rapidly. Golden light flashed from his body, and the roars of dragons and elephants echoed across heaven and earth.

“What’s happening!” The faceless ghost shouted, sensing the澎湃 (surging) ghostly mist within Luo Tian’s body. It abruptly stopped and was pushed back by a powerful force.

“Roar…” Luo Tian’s hands moved swiftly. Four dragons and four elephants flew from his body, covering the sky.

“Dragon-Elephant Sealing Prison! How could you…” The faceless ghost’s voice was filled with disbelief. Its body trembled violently, as if recalling a terrifying presence.

“Seal it!” Luo Tian’s expression was calm. He pressed his hands down into the void, and four dragons and four elephants descended from the sky, sealing over Luo Tian’s body.

“Buzz…” A powerful wave of suppression pressed onto Luo Tian. His entire body drenched in ghostly mist rapidly changed. The black mist receded swiftly, and Luo Tian’s aura began to violently retreat.

“True Immortal Intermediate… True Immortal Initial…” Luo Tian’s cultivation rapidly declined, stopping at the late-stage of Celestial Immortal. At the same time, his hundred-zhang body restored its golden hue, standing beneath the dark sky like a god.

“This is the intense cultivation!” Luo Tian’s dantian held a suspended black sphere. The four dragons and four elephants’ shadows covered the black ball, making Luo Tian sigh in admiration.

“Unfortunately, it’s not something I can touch!” Luo Tian sighed softly, gazing at the faceless ghost.

“Even if you mastered Dragon-Elephant Sealing Prison, what good is it? You’re still a mere ant in my eyes!” The faceless ghost’s voice was disdainful.

“You three are annoying. Today, you all must die!” The faceless ghost’s cold voice echoed through the heavens and earth, making Ye Liangchen and the others shiver.

“Buzz…” Before the faceless ghost’s words had finished, black rune dragons surged again, writhing before it.

“Go…” The faceless ghost commanded. Black rune dragons shot toward Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s face darkened. His massive body took a step forward, rushing toward Ye Liangchen.

His colossal form blocked Ye Liangchen and the others. However, at the same time, eight rune dragons pierced through Luo Tian’s body. A torrent of blood spilled out, instantly draining the color from Luo Tian’s face.

“Tian Ge!” Ye Liangchen shouted, surprised that Luo Tian would block for them at such a critical moment.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian’s body returned to normal size. His body still had eight rune dragons piercing through it.

Chapter 1922: Wine Sword

“Tian Ge… Are you alright?” Ye Liangchen no longer cared about anything else. He flew to Luo Tian’s side.

At this moment, Ye Liangchen’s gaze was complex. His expression toward Luo Tian had changed.

“Blocking it—what use is that? You still have to die. Daring to obstruct my great plan, I’ll make you perish without a grave!” The faceless ghost’s voice echoed. Several rune dragons flew again, and the slowly rising Huangquan Water resumed its original speed.

“Life force is fading!” Luo Tian’s face was pale. He felt his life force being drained by the black rune dragons piercing through his body.

“Of course it’s useful!” As another set of rune dragons rose and flew toward Luo Tian and the others, a voice echoed through the void.

“Buzz…” A golden light flashed. The void split open, and a golden sword energy appeared in Luo Tian’s line of sight.

The sword’s aura was terrifying, as if it could split the heavens. The golden energy surged violently and instantly appeared before Luo Tian’s group, slicing through the black rune dragons approaching them.

“Boom… Boom…” The black runes exploded violently before Luo Tian’s group, leaving them in shock.

A white-cloaked figure stepped out of the void. He held a sword, standing atop the sky. His clothes were torn, his face was bearded, but his eyes radiated golden light. He looked like a sharp sword that had yet to be drawn.

“Who are you?” The faceless ghost shouted. Everyone could sense the gravity in its voice.

“I’m a drunkard!” The middle-aged man spoke softly, removing his gourd from his waist and taking a big sip.

“True Immortal Peak!” Ye Liangchen’s group looked delighted. They hadn’t expected a powerful figure to appear at this moment.

“Buzz…” The energy surged again. Four figures tore through the black sky, stepping out of the void—Jiang Huantian and three elders from major sects at the late stage of True Immortal.

“Faceless Ghost!” Upon seeing it, their hearts jolted. Their gazes were filled with disbelief.

“Hell’s Gate!” Jiang Huantian’s face changed. His gaze was deep, looking at the endless abyss shrouded in black mist.

“How is it possible? Why is Hell’s Gate appearing in the lower three realms? It shouldn’t be…” Jiang Huantian’s eyes flashed with terror.

“I remember now. Jiuxuan Ghost Sect has nine gates, but one gate has never appeared— the Departure Gate!” Jiang Huantian spoke again, recalling something.

The three elders from major sects at the late stage of True Immortal were stunned, unaware of what Jiang Huantian was referring to.

“Buzz…” As the four marveled, the middle-aged man struck again. He slashed his sword toward the faceless ghost.

“Damn it… How is there a True Immortal Peak in the lower three realms!” The faceless ghost’s voice was laced with madness. Its current strength wasn’t at its peak, and maintaining the runes had drained it greatly. Facing a True Immortal Peak was a massive threat.

“Crash… Crash…” Black runes surged, thousands of them swirling and attacking the terrifying sword energy.

“Boom… Boom…” The runes exploded violently. The slowly rising Huangquan Water stopped again. Now, Luo Tian and the others stood atop the sky, able to see the endless ghostly creatures with their own eyes.

“Kill…” The middle-aged man growled, holding his seven-foot sword. He took a step forward and rushed toward the faceless ghost.

“Leave the rest to us!” Jiang Huantian looked at Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen, admiration in his eyes. He then turned his gaze to Zheng Tiande.

“Elder, don’t!” Luo Tian’s face was pale. He blocked Jiang Huantian. He knew Zheng Tiande had a connection with Long Youran and Long Li. If Jiang Huantian attacked, Zheng Tiande would definitely be killed.

“Let me try!” Luo Tian spoke to Jiang Huantian, his voice resolute.

“Hmm… Alright. Give you half a moment. If you can’t finish him in that time, I’ll kill him myself!” Jiang Huantian pondered. He thought of Luo Tian’s relationship with Jiang Yuzhe.

“Kill…” After Jiang Huantian spoke, he stepped toward the faceless ghost locked in fierce combat with the middle-aged man.

“You three—don’t let the lower three realms be destroyed. Come help!” Jiang Huantian shouted at the three stunned elders.

“Kill…” The three elders snapped out of their stupor. The lower three realms were their foundation; how could they not worry?

“Thank you, Elder!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully and slowly approached Zheng Tiande still under the control of Star River Sect’s six True Immortals at the initial stage.

“Uncle Zheng, I’m Luo Tian! Youran, let me take you home!” Luo Tian spoke to Zheng Tiande. Then he moved his hands, reactivating the Dragon-Elephant Sealing Prison technique. Four dragons and four elephants flew out again, sealing toward Zheng Tiande.

Under the Dragon-Elephant Sealing Prison technique, Zheng Tiande’s aura rapidly declined. It finally stopped at the early stage of Celestial Immortal.

“Huff…” Seeing Zheng Tiande’s cultivation, Ye Liangchen and the six True Immortals took deep breaths. Any one of them could subdue him at this stage.

“Ah…” However, Zheng Tiande still had black mist in his eyes. There was no sign of returning to normal. Being subdued by a True Immortal Initial, he continued to roar.

“Not good. He’s been invaded too deeply. There’s no way to heal him. Just give him a quick death!” Ye Liangchen shook his head gently.

“Youran raised him!” Luo Tian understood Ye Liangchen’s meaning. He sighed softly, making Ye Liangchen’s face slightly change.

“Save him! You must save him!” Ye Liangchen changed his expression, shouting loudly.

“Extract all of his cultivation and make him a commoner. He can live for several more decades!” Luo Tian shook his head gently. At this moment, he could only think of this solution.

“Extract it! It’s better than dying now!” Ye Liangchen extended his hand, taking out a pill. The intense medicinal power made Luo Tian slightly change.

“Master, this Rebirth Pill was given by the Sect Leader. It’s equivalent to a life. Don’t use it lightly!” One of the True Immortals at the initial stage spoke again, his voice laced with urgency. In their eyes, Zheng Tiande’s value was far less than this pill.

“Stop talking nonsense. I’ll save him!” Ye Liangchen snapped, his hand flicking. The pill turned into a streak of light and flew into Zheng Tiande’s mouth, who was still roaring.

“Tian Ge, this pill can protect his meridians!” Ye Liangchen looked at Zheng Tiande’s injuries and spoke to Luo Tian.

“Good. I’ll repay you with ten Rebirth Pills later!” Luo Tian nodded. With this pill, his confidence was greater. The roars of dragons and elephants echoed again within Zheng Tiande’s body.

After thirty breaths, Luo Tian extended his hand. A black sphere covered with dragon and elephant shadows flew from Zheng Tiande’s body, landing in Luo Tian’s hands.

“Pity…” Luo Tian sighed softly and stored the black sphere. His gaze turned to Zheng Tiande.

“Tian Dao Stage…” Zheng Tiande’s aura declined again. Finally, it disappeared completely without any energy fluctuations. Zheng Tiande’s eyes also regained clarity.

“I…” Zheng Tiande recalled the previous events, his voice laced with confusion. Then his body trembled violently. He looked at his aged hands, a bitter smile on his face.

“Uncle Zheng, I did my best!” Luo Tian shook his head gently. He knew the blow of losing one’s cultivation was immense for a cultivator.

“Everything was due to greed!” Zheng Tiande sighed longingly. Ye Liangchen supported him.

“You scum! You made me injured!” Roars echoed in their ears, making Luo Tian and the others turn toward the battlefield surrounding the faceless ghost.

At this moment, the faceless ghost was no longer composed. It wasn’t motionless but constantly moving. The black rune dragons that had nearly killed Luo Tian and the others were no longer a powerful attack but an encumbrance.

“Is this the strength of a True Immortal Peak?” Luo Tian looked at the middle-aged man. His aura was radiant, his golden sword constantly slicing through the faceless ghost. Each collision left wounds on it.

Jiang Huantian and the others also continuously attacked, subduing the faceless ghost. Black rune dragons constantly exploded, and a wild vortex rose beneath them, emitting chaotic energy.

“Ah…”

“I’ll make you all die!” The faceless ghost finally couldn’t endure. It severed its connection with the black rune dragons, and the Huangquan Water began to slowly recede.

Although it severed its connection, the faceless ghost still hadn’t increased its strength. It was still subdued by the middle-aged man and Jiang Huantian’s group.

“Buzz…” The faceless ghost generated waves beneath it, actively retreating toward the abyss.

“Don’t let him touch the Huangquan Water! If he does, he’ll recover to a half-step Immortal King. Then none of us will be his match!” Ye Liangchen shouted urgently.

“I was waiting for you to return!” The middle-aged man waved his hand. His sword sheathed, his eyes flashing with light. He took out a token.

“Supreme Heaven Token!” Luo Tian recognized the green token instantly.

The middle-aged man waved his hand. The green Supreme Heaven Token surged violently, instantly transforming into a vast sky. It pressed down toward the black abyss.

“Boom… Boom…” The Supreme Heaven Token completely covered the black abyss. Jiang Huantian and the others sighed deeply.

“Dudu…”, The middle-aged man took a big sip of wine, then spat it into the void. Divine mist rose, as if rain fell from heaven, landing on the Supreme Heaven Token. Divine laws flowed.

“Ah… You dare to suppress me! One day, the Huangquan Water will sweep across the celestial realm. The flowers of the other shore will bloom in every corner of the celestial realm!” The faceless ghost’s voice echoed beneath the Supreme Heaven Token, filled with resentment.

Chapter 1923: Jiang Taibai

“Boom… Boom…” Intense collision sounds continuously rose from beneath Luo Tian’s group. Even the collisions were enough to shake their minds.

“Seal…” The middle-aged man, with a gourd hanging from his waist, drew his sword again. A series of runes were inscribed beneath the massive Supreme Heaven Token.

The runes spread, and the intense collision sounds and the faceless ghost’s furious voice gradually weakened, disappearing from Luo Tian’s group.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows. Suddenly he remembered that Star River Sect hadn’t had a chance to give Ye Liangchen anything yet. Now, the Doomsday Forest was destroyed; it would be difficult to give him something later.

“Buzz…” However, Luo Tian extended his hand. A streak of light flew from it toward the sky. Everyone focused on the middle-aged man, but as the streak rose, Jiang Huantian and the three sect elders’ gazes flickered slightly.

The black clouds dispersed. The lower three realms became quiet, revealing the vast starry sky. A streak of light fell from the heavens like a meteor, flying toward them.

“Boom… Boom…” The thunderous sound shook the sky. Everyone turned their gaze to the source of the disturbance. Ye Liangchen and the six True Immortals from Star River Sect looked slightly changed.

A green palace, wrapped in starlight, crashed toward them violently.

“Star River Sect!”

“It’s Star River Sect!” Ye Liangchen and the six True Immortals looked at the massive palace descending from the sky, their faces filled with joy.

“Star River Sect’s ancestral treasure!” The middle-aged man muttered softly. Jiang Huantian and the three sect elders also looked astonished, then turned their gazes toward Luo Tian. They clearly remembered that Luo Tian had flashed a streak of light earlier, and Star River Sect had descended from the sky.

“Come…” The middle-aged man extended his hand. The green palace shrank to palm size, landing in the middle-aged man’s hands.

“Unexpectedly, Star River Sect has become like this!” The middle-aged man sighed, holding the green Star River Sect and long sighing, as if recalling something.

“This…” Ye Liangchen’s group looked at the Star River Sect falling into the middle-aged man’s hands, their faces changing. The middle-aged man’s strength was evident to them. Now that Star River Sect had fallen into his hands, if he didn’t return it, they had no way to get it back.

“Alas… I have some connection with Ye Sheng from Star River Sect. Take it!” The middle-aged man waved his hand, sending the Star River Sect to Ye Liangchen’s side.

“Uncle?” Ye Liangchen was slightly stunned. He hadn’t expected this incredibly strong middle-aged man to have a connection with his uncle Ye Sheng.

“Respect Jiang Elder!” Jiang Huantian bowed slightly, addressing the middle-aged man. His voice was respectful, clearly recognizing this man.

“Who is he? How could Jiang Huantian be so respectful!” Luo Tian and the others wondered. When had a person like this appeared in the lower three realms?

“His surname is Jiang, he carries a sword, and he has a gourd. He knows my uncle!” Ye Liangchen’s eyes showed contemplation, then suddenly widened.

“Wine-Sword Immortal, Jiang Taibai!” Ye Liangchen exclaimed in disbelief. His gaze turned to the middle-aged man, filled with respect.

“Jiang Taibai?” Luo Tian and the others were confused. Only Jiang Huantian stood respectfully.

“Alright, the matter is resolved. I’ll be leaving now!” Jiang Taibai returned to his messy appearance, removing the gourd from his waist and taking a big sip. He wiped his mouth and addressed Jiang Huantian.

“According to seniority, I should call you great-uncle. Greetings, great-uncle!” Ye Liangchen’s face was filled with excitement and immediately knelt before Jiang Taibai.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian jumped up, his eyes filled with disbelief as he looked at Ye Liangchen kneeling.

“Master!” The six True Immortals accompanying Ye Liangchen were also filled with shock. In their minds, besides Ye Wu Dao and Ye Tian, Ye Liangchen had never knelt before anyone else.

“…”

“You son, you’re just like Ye Sheng!” Jiang Taibai’s face was slightly stunned. He shook his head, looking at Ye Liangchen who stared directly at him without getting up. A fool would know that Ye Liangchen wanted a gift.

“Take this jade pendant, it can save your life once!” Jiang Taibai waved his hand. A jade pendant fell before Ye Liangchen.

“Thank you, great-uncle!” Ye Liangchen stored the jade pendant but remained kneeling.

“You bastard! Although you’re Ye Sheng’s nephew, if you provoke me, I’ll still beat your ass!” Seeing Ye Liangchen’s greed, Jiang Taibai’s mouth twitched.

“Uncle, I have a habit. I like to eat, drink, and play around. I don’t really like treasures, but I do love wine. Uncle, your gourd has the finest wine in heaven. Could you give me some? I don’t need much—just a few barrels!” Ye Liangchen stored the jade pendant and addressed Jiang Taibai.

“You son, you’re really shameless. Just like Ye Sheng. That old bastard never stopped stealing my wine. A few barrels? I’ll only let you drink a sip, no more!” Jiang Taibai threw the gourd to Ye Liangchen’s hands.

“A sip is a sip. At least it’s better than nothing!” Ye Liangchen’s eyes gleamed. He was the sole heir of Star River Sect, loved since childhood. Ye Sheng often told him things others didn’t know. Jiang Taibai was also a story Ye Sheng had told to Ye Liangchen.

“Liangchen, listen carefully. When you meet Jiang Taibai, no matter what method you use, you must drink his wine. Even if it means being shameless. Rest assured, he’ll let you off because of my face!” Ye Liangchen remembered Ye Sheng’s words. He hadn’t forgotten them. Now, seeing Jiang Taibai, he wouldn’t miss the chance.

Ye Liangchen took the gourd and didn’t hesitate. He immediately tilted his head back to drink.

“Gurgle… Gurgle…” Ye Liangchen’s throat moved. At the moment he drank, his eyes widened, and his face turned red.

“Buzz…” A buzzing sound echoed within Ye Liangchen’s body. His aura began to slowly rise.

“Excellent!” Jiang Taibai nodded, looking at the starry vortex above.

“Promotion! Master has promoted!” The six True Immortals at the initial stage shouted, their faces filled with disbelief.

A gust of wind surged from Ye Liangchen’s body. It felt like a thousand wind blades, making Luo Tian’s face slightly change. He quickly protected Zheng Tiande.

“Cough… Cough…” After about ten breaths, Ye Liangchen stopped. His face was filled with reluctance and regret. He looked at the gourd in his hands, finally understanding why Ye Sheng had made him drink Jiang Taibai’s wine.

“Excellent. You lasted thirteen breaths. You didn’t disgrace Ye Sheng!” Jiang Taibai nodded, retrieving the gourd.

“Alas… I was about to promote to late-stage Celestial Immortal!”

“Great-uncle… That wine is so good. Can I have another sip?” Ye Liangchen licked his lips and addressed Jiang Taibai again.

“Go to hell!” Jiang Taibai kicked Ye Liangchen away. His voice was laced with impatience. He turned his gaze to Luo Tian.

“You son, your name is Luo Tian?” Jiang Taibai’s face showed a slight smile. He looked at Luo Tian.

“Huh?” Luo Tian felt a chill. Why did Jiang Taibai know his name? He had never met him before.

“Indeed, my name is Luo Tian!” Though cautious, Luo Tian’s face was respectful as he addressed Jiang Taibai.

“Elder Jiang, his name is Luo Tian…” Jiang Huantian quickly spoke, recounting everything about Luo Tian’s actions at the Fantasy Island. He didn’t miss a single detail, including saving Jiang Yuzhe.

“Ah… You saved Jiuyu?” Jiang Taibai nodded. Then his eyes turned contemplative.

“Who is Gu Tianshu?” However, Jiang Taibai’s next question made Luo Tian’s face change drastically.

“Elder, do you know Gu Tianshu?” Luo Tian remained silent. His face showed no change. He didn’t know if Jiang Taibai was an ally or enemy.

“Met once, had a drink. He also used the same transformation into a giant technique as you!” Jiang Taibai’s face showed a slight smile.

“Gu Tianshu is my family’s ancestor!” Luo Tian spoke softly. He felt no hostility. If there was, he wouldn’t have spoken politely.

“Indeed!”

“Because you delayed time and saved Jiuyu, as well as being Gu Tianshu’s descendant, I’ll let you drink a sip of my wine!” Jiang Taibai waved his hand and extended the gourd toward Luo Tian.

Seeing Jiang Taibai’s action, Jiang Huantian’s face slightly changed. He knew how rare Jiang Taibai’s wine was. Many wanted it but he wouldn’t give it.

Jiang Taibai giving it to Ye Liangchen, Jiang Huantian knew was because of Ye Sheng. But giving it to Luo Tian, he couldn’t understand.

Hearing Jiang Taibai’s words, the three sect elders and six True Immortals looked with envy. Ye Liangchen had promoted to late-stage Celestial Immortal after one sip. Anyone would know Jiang Taibai’s wine was no ordinary treasure.

“Thank you, Elder!” Luo Tian took the gourd. He secretly decided to drink until he died.

“One sip…” Jiang Taibai spoke softly, standing there waiting for Luo Tian.

“Yes!” Luo Tian took a deep breath. He raised his head, took the gourd, and didn’t drink like Ye Liangchen but sipped slowly.

“Buzz…” After the wine entered his body, Luo Tian felt a warm sensation. His entire body became dizzy, and his injuries instantly healed.

Luo Tian’s throat moved slowly. His aura changed rapidly. His cultivation began to grow steadily.

Chapter 1924: Watch Me Drink Him to Tears

“Freed…!” Luo Tian’s first feeling was freedom. His cultivation continued to rise, though not as fast as before when the faceless ghost had boosted it. Still, it was a hundred times faster than normal cultivation and pure.

His dantian felt a burning sensation. However, Luo Tian was also confused. This was so simple; anyone could keep drinking it. But Ye Liangchen’s expression had clearly shown he couldn’t drink more.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian drank for the third breath, his face slightly changed. The wine in his mouth changed. It felt like not drinking wine but a series of sharp swords flowing into his body, slicing through his entire meridians.

“Pain…” The sharp swords continuously sliced through his body’s meridians, making Luo Tian苦笑.

“Why Ye Liangchen only lasted thirteen breaths!” Now Luo Tian understood why Ye Liangchen had stopped after just thirteen breaths.

“Others need money to drink, but Jiang Taibai’s wine needs a life. If you drink too long, your meridians might be torn apart!”

“But my meridians are much stronger than ordinary people. I should be able to last a while!” Luo Tian muttered in his mind.

“Huh? This is good stuff! Haha!” As Luo Tian was about to drink himself to death, Maque’s voice echoed in his mind.

“Come!” Maque didn’t say a word. Like a thief, he immediately sucked the wine into his Beast-Controlling Seal before it even entered Luo Tian’s body.

“Huh…” Luo Tian opened his eyes. His face changed drastically. He hadn’t expected Maque to appear at this moment.

“Did you not last long enough? Only eight breaths!” Jiang Taibai frowned, looking at Luo Tian’s face.

“Indeed, he can’t match the master!” The six True Immortals smiled slightly. Their gazes were respectful toward Ye Liangchen.

“Thief!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly. His meridians no longer felt the tearing sensation, but he was very annoyed.

“Elder, this isn’t fair! This was my opportunity. You just took it without giving me any soup!” Luo Tian felt the wine entering his Beast-Controlling Seal and being devoured by Maque. His heart was bleeding.

“Son, you can’t drink much anyway. It’s better to be kind and give it to me. Watch me make him cry, hehe! I didn’t expect to find such a good thing!” Maque’s excited voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

“Huh? Thirteen breaths!” Outside, everyone saw Luo Tian’s face still looked like a suffering one. But the time had already passed thirteen breaths.

“Excellent!” Jiang Taibai nodded, his eyes showing a slight admiration. To endure thirteen breaths was quite good.

“Elder, this isn’t right. This was originally mine. You ate the meat but didn’t let me have any soup!” Luo Tian, however, didn’t care about what was happening outside. He continuously communicated with Maque, feeling that Maque devoured Jiang Taibai’s wine. His heart was filled with jealousy.
