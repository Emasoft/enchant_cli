“Give me that boy!” Ye Liangchen smiled, still delighted to see Luo Tian safe.

Luo Tian waved his hand, tossing out the body and head of Zhou Li, who was unconscious, pale as a ghost.

Luo Tian’s face turned cold. He pointed his finger, and a multicolored flame shot into Zhou Li’s body, causing him to scream in agony as he awoke.

“Master!” Zhou Li cried out, his voice filled with entreaty, gazing at Luo Tian in hope of mercy.

“I was wrong before—I shouldn’t have awakened your ambition!” Luo Tian shook his head gently. When Zhou Li had betrayed him for profit, Luo Tian had already resolved to kill him, though he lacked the chance at that time.

“Let’s go!” Ye Sheng waved his hand, retrieving Ye Wudao and Zhou Li before soaring into the sky toward Star River Mansion.

“I should be leaving too,” Luo Tian said, holding a Wheel Turning Disk, his expression contemplative as he inscribed runes into it.

The Daoic laws flowed around him, and Luo Tian’s form twisted before vanishing from sight.

…

At Tianlan Sect’s Grand Hall, figures sat in anxious silence. The sect had ceased to be itself—entire Tianyuan Sect had relocated here, over a million people now housed within Tianlan.

With Tianyuan’s defection from the Celestial Realm, news spread swiftly. The Tianlan Sect Master was stunned but had no choice—everyone knew Tianyuan resided here, and even if they could flee, their ties would never be severed.

“Alas…” The Tianlan Master spent days in despair, fearing the arrival of the Nine Sacred Mountains’ armies.

At that moment, Jiang Sxi and others sat in the hall, their hearts heavy. Luo Tian had sent no word for days.

“Without Luo Tian to negotiate with Hell, this remains a problem!” Jiang Sxi spoke, silencing the hall.

“Diao Dezhu’s group has already gone to meet them, but we don’t know if they succeeded,” Nan Gong Yuqing added.

“Hum…” As they spoke, tremors rippled through Tianlan’s skies. The heavens twisted as a figure descended toward the earth.

“I said teleportation never brings good news!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly as he materialized, immediately cursing.

“Ah! This is teleportation!” The hall’s people sensed it instantly, rushing out in a blur.

“Boom…” Luo Tian crashed into the ground, his bones feeling shattered as he laughed bitterly.

The blood of屠天 (Tushan) could not remain in Luo Tian’s body indefinitely; prolonged use would harm him, even affecting his mind. Though he had no choice but to wield it, the cost was steep.

Moreover, Luo Tian’s two uses of the Demon-Subjugating Body had left him battered. He collapsed unconscious.

“Luo Tian!” The crowd’s faces lit up with joy, surrounding him instantly.

“Don’t move!” Runhongyu rushed forward, sensing Luo Tian’s severe injuries.

Jiang Yuexiong frowned, approaching and producing a green pill. He pried Luo Tian’s mouth open, slipping the medicine inside.

“He’s injured beyond measure—most bones broken, many displaced, his meridians torn. What did this boy do?” Jiang Yuexiong muttered, though relief softened his expression. Though grievous, Luo Tian’s life was safe—this was a blessing.

All eyes held awe; they knew the difficulty of Luo Tian’s lone rearguard duty. Returning was a miracle.

“Leave it to us two,” Runhongyu smiled, addressing the group.

“You’re overcomplicating it! Why not just gather heavenly power?” Li Tianzhi and others scoffed.

“You don’t understand!” Runhongyu shook his head, lifting Luo Tian onto his back. Jiang Yuexiong followed silently as they ignored the others.

“Let’s go—back. When Luo Tian wakes, inform Hell’s people!” Jiang Sxi sighed, relieved the sect had survived despite its trials.

With Luo Tian’s return, all of Tianyuan Sect learned the news, their spirits lifted. They remembered Luo Tian’s lone stand against the rear, a memory etched in their minds.

Meanwhile, Hell’s forces stationed afar received news. Du Jianhang emerged from the army, flying toward Tianlan Sect.

Du Jianhang’s arrival naturally drew Jiang Sxi’s attention—his identity as Luo Tian’s master was known.

Du Jianhang surveyed Luo Tian’s injuries, finding no life-threatening wounds before joining Jiang Sxi in the Grand Hall.

“Senior Master Du, this is Luo Tian’s condition. We’ve all gathered here,” Jiang Sxi said respectfully.

“Hmph, I’ve already informed the Sect Leader. What are your plans? If you join my Wheel Turning Sect, we welcome you wholeheartedly,” Du Jianhang said. Tianyuan was a formidable force, surpassing even Hell’s Eight Heavenly Kings. Joining the Wheel Turning Sect would be a boon for them.

“This is too big—wait until Luo Tian recovers,” Jiang Sxi and others replied. Though Du Jianhang was Luo Tian’s master, this involved two sects; they couldn’t decide alone. Moreover, no one wished to lose their hard-won power—Tianyuan was their faith.

Chapter 2596: Independence ()

At Tianlan Sect’s peak, a figure stood gazing at the bustling Tianyuan Sect below.

“How is he recovering?” A youth appeared, smiling as he addressed the other youth standing in a daze.

Time left no mark on them; they remained youthful. These were Luo Tian and Runhongyu.

After a day of treatment by Runhongyu and Jiang Yuexiong, Luo Tian gradually regained consciousness. Though not fully healed, he could walk.

“Better,” Luo Tian nodded, smiling.

When Luo Tian awoke, they relayed Du Jianhang’s message to him.

“Another dilemma!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly. When Tianyuan chose the Nine Sacred Mountains, he had faced a choice—now, another: join the Wheel Turning Sect. Logically, Tianyuan should align with it to attack the Celestial Realm, as the latter could no longer tolerate them.

But joining meant Tianyuan’s sect would vanish—Luo Tian, Jiang Sxi, and Xiang Tianming all refused. No one wished to see their home lost.

Luo Tian also felt a connection with the Nine Regions; he didn’t want their people to lose their home.

Not joining would anger many Wheel Turning Sect disciples and elders, especially as he was their Holy Son. Moreover, Tianlan’s position at the battlefield’s heart meant neither Celestial nor Hell realms would let Tianyuan stay.

“This is the Middle Three Heavens—Immortal Peak cannot enter here,” Luo Tian mused, watching the people below.

“Don’t worry; whatever you decide, they’ll accept it,” Runhongyu told Luo Tian.

“I know!” Luo Tian sighed, but he couldn’t act rashly—seeking a compromise was essential.

“Wait longer; let Tianyuan stabilize first,” Luo Tian murmured, unable to find a solution.

He descended the peak, wrapped in a thick coat as cold winds bit through him. He tightened his cloak.

Walking the main road, Tianyuan disciples bowed respectfully to Luo Tian, their admiration blind.

“Is there anything unusual at Tianlan? Give them what they need. If they wish to leave, I can let them enter Star River Mansion. If they want to join Hell, I’ll introduce them to the Wheel Turning Sect,” Luo Tian told Runhongyu.

Though unassuming, Runhongyu was the most cunning among them.

“If Jiang Nanxuan were here, I wouldn’t have to think so hard!” Luo Tian sighed, missing Jiang Nanxuan’s ingenuity.

“Some have already left; the Tianlan Sect Master stayed,” Runhongyu replied.

They had wronged Tianlan, but without Tianyuan’s arrival, it couldn’t have held back Hell.

“Independence! Tianyuan must not disband!” Luo Tian decided, stepping into a grand hall.

Jiang Sxi and Nan Gong Yuqing sat there; seeing Luo Tian, they smiled.

“Master!” Luo Tian bowed to Du Jianhang, respect in his eyes.

“How are you?” Du Jianhang smiled, scanning Luo Tian. Finding no major issues, he spoke softly.

“Hmph, I’ve decided,” Luo Tian nodded, gazing at Du Jianhang with regret.

Du Jianhang understood immediately but showed no surprise; he knew Luo Tian well.

“Tianyuan will stay here. Let Hell and the Celestial Realm fight—鬼门关 (Guimen Pass) is open; the Wheel Turning Sect can attack from other directions!” Luo Tian said quietly. His demand was modest: ten million miles of Tianlan’s territory.

Hearing this, the hall’s people smiled; they too wished no alliances—this freedom was precious.

“But we fear other sects may disagree,” one added.

“Then you’ll handle it yourselves,” Du Jianhang nodded. He knew Bailing and Wu Chang would grant Luo Tian this favor, but other sects were less accommodating.

Du Jianhang knew Bailing and Wu Chang favored Luo Tian; otherwise, he wouldn’t have thrived in Hell.

“Then I’ll go. Take care!”

“Remember, call if you need anything—I’m your master,” Du Jianhang told Luo Tian before leaving.

“Hmph!”

“I’ll visit the Wheel Turning Sect when I recover,” Luo Tian felt touched, respectfully seeing Du Jianhang off.

After sending Du Jianhang away, Luo Tian and others returned to the Grand Hall, their faces bright.

“Now that it’s decided, we must face what comes next. Lingkong, the array matters—entrust it to you!” Jiang Sxi took the leader’s seat upon returning.

“Dog, scouting matters—entrust it to you!” Jiang Sxi issued orders constantly.

Luo Tian sat silently, listening as Jiang Sxi assigned tasks. He added a few comments when needed.

Everyone left the hall, busy with their duties. Luo Tian, still injured, had nothing to do.

Chen Zhanbiao and Meng Xue accompanied Luo Tian, guarding his safety. Tianyuan Sect began settling in.

“Big brother, let’s eat. I’m hungry!” Chen Zhanbiao followed Luo Tian, his stomach growling, making Luo Tian smile.

“Good—this is rare leisure,” Luo Tian nodded, watching Chen Zhanbiao. He cherished Chen and Long Jie deeply, seeing them as his brothers despite their age.

“Hear there’s a Panlong Mountain ten thousand miles away, with a Panlong Pool. The water is sweet, and the pool holds golden dragon fish. Can we catch them for dinner?” Chen Zhanbiao’s eyes gleamed.

“Good,” Luo Tian nodded, unconcerned; this was Tianyuan’s domain, and ten thousand miles wasn’t far. He suspected Chen had long desired this.

Chapter 2597: Panlong Mountain ()

In the Celestial Realm’s Middle Three Heavens, Tianyuan Sect absorbed Tianlan Sect. The news spread swiftly through both realms, causing a stir.

“Where do they dare stay? This is where Celestial and Hell realms fight—don’t they fear being caught in the crossfire?”

“Tianyuan is lucky; despite nine Sacred Mountains’ forces, they weren’t destroyed. Instead, they were routed and suffered heavy losses. That Luo Tian is truly formidable—surviving this!” Celestials murmured.

Even more shocking was Hell’s decision to bypass Tianyuan, attacking from another direction and catching Celestials off guard. Hell’s forces advanced deeper into the realm.

War raged; other Guimen Passes also achieved victories, pushing further into Celestial Realm.

Tianyuan remained untouched due to the war’s chaos. Yet, they knew once the battle ended, both realms would deal with them.

Tianyuan preferred Hell’s victory; their grudge with Celestials was irreconcilable.

Luo Tian, for once, enjoyed peace, walking with Chen Zhanbiao and Meng Xue toward Panlong Mountain.

They walked instead of flying, Luo Tian relaxed as he observed Tianyuan’s cities—no war had reached here.

After a day, they arrived at Panlong City, near Panlong Mountain.

The city was small; due to Luo Tian’s condition, they didn’t enter Panlong Mountain at night but stayed in a inn.

The inn was the city’s best, offering meals and lodging.

“Waiter, order food!” Chen Zhanbiao and Meng Xue’s towering figures drew attention.

The city’s cultivators were low-level, only True Immortal Initial Stage. They knew of Hell’s attack and Tianyuan but didn’t recognize the trio.

“Guests, what would you like?” The waiter smiled, wiping tables as he spoke.

“Bring three servings of everything! Go!” Chen Zhanbiao ordered.

“What?” The waiter blinked, surprised by the request.

The inn was the city’s best, offering over four hundred dishes—three servings meant over a thousand. The price alone was staggering.

“Guest, are you sure?” The waiter eyed Chen Zhanbiao, noting their modest attire.

“Don’t worry about the money; also book two best rooms!” Chen Zhanbiao waved his hand, dropping a crystal the size of a baby’s fist onto the table. It radiated spiritual aura.

“Spirit Crystal!” The diners gasped, stunned.

The waiter’s face paled, eyes wide with disbelief at Chen Zhanbiao.

“Enough? Hurry and bring the food—after a day’s walk, I’m starving!” Chen Zhanbiao urged.

“Enough! But guest, this spirit crystal is enough for the dishes—but it’s too much. However, our inn has a specialty—if you wish to try it, add something…” The waiter smiled.

“Delicious?” Chen Zhanbiao’s eyes lit up. He had no concept of money; the spirit crystals and stones on him were given by Meng Xue.

“Yes, it’s the silver dragon fish from Panlong Pool—our specialty, no other inn has it!” The waiter boasted.

“Just a fish? So expensive?” Meng Xue frowned, noting the crystal could buy the inn.

“Guests don’t know—this silver dragon fish isn’t easy to catch. Only our boss can fish it, and only one per day,” the waiter explained respectfully.

“Good—then bring me one!” Chen Zhanbiao shrugged, handing another crystal to the waiter.

“Rich!” The diners marveled, watching Chen Zhanbiao dismissively toss crystals.

“Alright, the silver dragon fish hasn’t been sold yet—let me instruct the kitchen!” The waiter’s grin stretched to his ears, eager for the commission.

Soon, dishes piled up. Chen Zhanbiao devoured them hungrily.

Meng Xue also ate, making Luo Tian’s skin crawl—these two might devour the entire Tianyuan Sect.

Yet, Luo Tian smiled; he hadn’t eaten properly in a while. Watching Chen Zhanbiao eat was an enjoyment—his food smelled delicious.

The diners gaped, stunned by the pair’s appetite.

“Too scary—what are their stomachs made of?” They whispered, watching Chen Zhanbiao like a miracle.

Half an hour later, the thousand dishes were gone. Luo Tian ate little.

Chen Zhanbiao sighed contentedly, oil on his lips, saying: “Truly, this small inn’s food is good. Though I’m only half-full, the fish hasn’t come yet?”

Chen Zhanbiao shouted, expectant. His goal was the fish.

“Here it comes!” As he spoke, the waiter rushed in, carrying a dish. A fragrant aroma filled the air.

“Good!” Chen Zhanbiao’s eyes brightened; as a true foodie, he could judge each dish.

“I want this fish!” Before the waiter reached their table, the inn’s door opened—another figure stood outside, voice echoing inside.

Chapter 2598: Eating Fish ()

The inn’s door opened, drawing attention—a fat old monk in a robe, bald with a shaved head and a mark of precepts.

“Monk?” The diners smiled.

“Him?” Luo Tian narrowed his eyes, recognizing the monk—Master of Jiedu, the fat monk’s master.

“Master, do you eat meat?” The waiter smiled at the fat monk.

“Nonsense! What use is it if I don’t eat? Hurry and bring it!” The monk’s face showed eagerness, drooling.

But the waiter had already placed the fish on their table. Regardless, Luo Tian’s group ordered first, so it was theirs.

A silver fish lay on the plate, its fragrance spreading, drawing everyone’s gaze.

“Too fragrant!”

“This is the first time I’ve seen this silver dragon fish!” Diners gaped, drooling.

“This is a spirit crystal!” Soon, they turned to Luo Tian’s group—buying a fish with one crystal made them clearly rich.

“Roar…” A dragon’s cry echoed from the dead fish, emitting a powerful aura.

“They say this silver dragon fish has some dragon blood, hence the faint roar!” Diners whispered.

“This might not be good…” Luo Tian mused, thinking of Long Jie upon the dragon’s blood.

“Big brother, don’t worry—Long Jie would eat it more enthusiastically!” Chen Zhanbiao told Luo Tian, the fish far inferior to Long Jie.

As he spoke, Chen Zhanbiao lifted his chopsticks toward the silver fish!

“Stop!” But before he touched it, a shout rang out.

“Huh?” Chen Zhanbiao blinked, turning to see the fat monk at their table.

“You’re wasting this delicacy! Such a feast shouldn’t be eaten directly!” The monk scolded Chen Zhanbiao.

“Stay away, you want to steal it?” Chen Zhanbiao eyed the monk cautiously, like a beast guarding its food.

“This silver dragon fish is good, but it’s not suitable for direct consumption—fish has some odor. Best to rinse with strong wine, the stronger the better!” The monk advised.

“Ah! That’s why!” Chen Zhanbiao nodded, taking out the wine on the table.

“This wine isn’t strong enough,” the monk said, “I have a thousand-year-aged brew, excellent monkey wine—brewed by a Buddha of Sumeru.”

The monk carefully opened the flask, releasing a scorching aroma. The inn filled with wine and fish scent, the wine overpowering the fish.

“Sumeru?” Meng Xue’s eyes narrowed, placing her chopsticks down and reaching for her sword, Longyuan. She had received it from Luo Tian upon returning.

Luo Tian glanced at Meng Xue, shaking his head slightly to signal she needn’t act. If the monk meant harm, he’d have attacked already. Yet Luo Tian didn’t grasp his intent—Sumeru had some friction with him.

“Sumeru!” The diners’ faces shifted, gazing at the monk—Nine Sacred Mountains were leagues above their small Panlong City.

“Ah, a Sumeru Sect elder!” Many bowed respectfully to the monk.

“Good wine!” Chen Zhanbiao didn’t think much, sniffing the monk’s flask.

“May I join you?” The monk smiled at Luo Tian.

“Please, Master,” Luo Tian nodded, gesturing him to sit.

“Haha! Then I won’t be rude!” The monk laughed, finding a seat.

Meng Xue stood up, moving to Luo Tian’s other side, sitting with Chen Zhanbiao, placing Luo Tian in the center.

The monk seemed oblivious, pouring wine into each of their cups. The aroma filled the inn.

“I’m drunk—what is this wine? Why does it make my spiritual energy flow so fast?” As the wine poured, diners gasped, eyes wide with shock at the monk.

“This is an opportunity!” Suddenly, everyone felt they’d encountered one—this wine accelerated their spiritual energy. They began cultivating immediately.

“Come on, drink!” Chen Zhanbiao gulped the wine, making the monk gape, his mouth twitching.

“Ugh… spicy…” Next moment, Chen Zhanbiao’s face turned red, spitting out his tongue, gazing at the monk: “This wine is toxic!”

“Who told you to drink it all at once?” The monk grabbed a fish piece, tossing it into Chen Zhanbiao’s mouth.

“Hmm…” The fish entered his mouth, and he closed it immediately, a look of ecstasy on his face.

“Ah…爽…” Chen Zhanbiao opened his mouth, sweat pouring, his body echoing with thunder.

“I’m starting!” The monk sipped a little wine, lifting chopsticks to eat.

Luo Tian also took a sip, feeling a fiery sensation surge through his body—his face shifted slightly.

“Wine is good—it invigorates the meridians!” The monk competed with Chen Zhanbiao, speaking to Luo Tian.

“Thank you,” Luo Tian smiled slightly, picking a fish piece, feeling coldness clash with the fire in his body.

Meng Xue also began eating; four people devoured the fish, though most pieces were taken by Chen Zhanbiao and the monk.

“Comfortable!”

“No regret coming here!” Chen Zhanbiao burped, gazing at the monk. The monk also looked at him—mutual admiration.

Luo Tian watched them, recalling their fierce competition earlier, now this expression.

“Master, what’s your name?” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the monk.

“Don’t say it!” The monk blushed slightly, quickly replying.

Chapter 2599: Idiot ()

“Master, you’ve been drinking and eating again!” As the monk’s words ended, a monk appeared at the inn’s door—Jiedu.

“Ugh…” Seeing Jiedu, the monk wiped his mouth, feeling headache.

“Luo Tian Master, long time no see!” Jiedu smiled warmly, his eyes lighting up at Luo Tian.

“Luo Master indeed has wisdom—his demonic nature has lessened so much!” Jiedu addressed Luo Tian.

“Ha… ha…” Luo Tian chuckled, also feeling headache—unclear why his master and disciple came.

“Disciple, don’t be angry; don’t break the precepts!” The monk told Jiedu.

“Buddha’s mercy!” The monk addressed Jiedu, making him straighten up, hands clasped.

“Master, you’ve eaten too much!” Jiedu kept speaking, his hands forming seals. Holy light flashed, imprinting itself on those seated to cultivate.

The entire inn was enveloped in holy light, purifying their bodies.

“Hmm?”

“My wine aroma has vanished!” Diners gasped,懊恼, gazing at Jiedu.

Yet they dared not speak out—after all, he was from Sumeru.

“Master Jiedu, what’s your sect name?” Luo Tian smiled, addressing him.

“Don’t say it!” The monk quickly stopped him, gazing at Jiedu, hand covering his mouth.

“Master, your name is Idiot!” But Jiedu spoke truthfully; the monk’s hand couldn’t block it.

“Pu…” Hearing Jiedu, Luo Tian spat out the wine he’d just sipped. His mouth gradually lifted into a smile, then burst into laughter.

“Ha… ha…” Chen Zhanbiao and Meng Xue also laughed heartily, others’ faces reddened, gazing at the monk, unable to laugh but stifling their laughter.

“Stupid kid!” Idiot glared at Jiedu, slapping his head.

“Master, what’s wrong? Isn’t it right? One leaf blocks the view—your third place is Idiot, given by your ancestor!” Jiedu looked puzzled, then solemnly addressed Idiot.

“Idiot… Master… I’m sorry I couldn’t hold back!” Luo Tian laughed, but after saying “Idiot Master,” he burst into laughter again.

“Enough!” Idiot gazed at Luo Tian, but the trio still laughed. Idiot finally wore a sad face.

“Master, what’s your purpose here?” Luo Tian knew with Jiedu present, Idiot wouldn’t attack him—Jiedu would never let others be killed.

“Just strolling, hungry, seeing an old friend!” Idiot sneered at Luo Tian.

“Master, don’t break the precepts!” Jiedu saw Idiot angry and spoke.

“…” Idiot gazed at Jiedu, wondering if his disciple was sent by heaven to torment him.

“Idiot Master, bring out more wine!” Chen Zhanbiao gazed at Idiot, licking his lips.

“Impossible! I stole it from that monkey…” Idiot quickly replied, but only half spoke.

“Master, you went to the Holy Buddha and stole wine again?” Jiedu frowned slightly.

“Those two nutty masters!” Luo Tian smiled, one doing anything, the other nothing. Yet hearing Idiot’s words, Luo Tian thought of someone—斗战圣佛 (Doustan Shengfo), the Buddha of Struggle.

Luo Tian had known Sumeru had a Buddha of Struggle, a descendant of the Monkey King. It was likely related to Yao Chen (Yaozun), the demon emperor of Tianyuan.

But Luo Tian didn’t know why Yaozun had become Sumeru’s Buddha of Struggle, nor why Yaozun had failed the Celestial Path—two different eras.

“Master Idiot, if there’s nothing else, we’ll leave!” Luo Tian didn’t ask further, standing up. He didn’t wish to engage with Idiot and Jiedu, sensing they were trouble.

Chen Zhanbiao and Meng Xue followed Luo Tian back to their room, though Chen Zhanbiao and Luo Tian shared a room while Meng Xue stayed next door.

“Zhanbiao, send them a message to strengthen vigilance—since they came, other sects might too!” Luo Tian told Chen Zhanbiao, ordering Tianyuan to be alert.

One night passed silently. Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, sensing his injuries.

“Don’t say it—Idiot’s wine really helps!” Luo Tian muttered, smiling as he felt his broken meridians regrowing slightly. Some ghostly energy drifted in his body.

“Big brother, I’ll go get some for you!” Hearing Luo Tian say the wine was good, Chen Zhanbiao’s eyes lit up. To help Luo Tian recover, he’d try hard.

“No need—can’t get it. And this wine helps little. Let’s go!” Luo Tian smiled, stepping out of the inn without noticing Idiot and Jiedu.

Meng Xue had waited at the inn’s door; they headed toward Panlong City’s outskirts. Ten thousand feet away was Panlong Mountain.

A mountain peak stood like a coiled dragon, visible from Panlong City.

They walked for an hour before reaching the mountain’s base, gazing at its dense forest. They ascended directly.

Chen Zhanbiao and Meng Xue were Immortal Peak-level, so Panlong Mountain posed no threat. They weren’t overly concerned.

But upon entering the forest, Chen Zhanbiao became lively, hunting wild game and picking fruits.

“Zhanbiao, is this edible?” Luo Tian was speechless as Chen Zhanbiao attacked everything, making the forest chaotic.

“Big brother, you don’t understand—this is best steamed. Remove the head and it’s edible!” Chen Zhanbiao grinned, explaining his spoils to Luo Tian, pointing out insects and snakes.

“All are delicious! But I miss the roasted chicken wings from before—so fragrant!” Chen Zhanbiao recalled Nine Regions’ phoenix wings, wandering the forest like a child.

They walked until hearing water sounds, a cool sensation hitting their bodies.

They reached the source—a hundred-foot-wide pool appeared before them.
