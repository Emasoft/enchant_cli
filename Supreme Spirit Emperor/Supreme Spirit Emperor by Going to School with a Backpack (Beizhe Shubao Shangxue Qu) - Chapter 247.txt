The Sovereign of Gods and Demons, regarded as the most audacious figure in the Divine and Demon Realm, unparalleled in history. He cultivated both divine and demonic arts simultaneously, founding the Divine and Demon Realm itself. Today, the most powerful factions within this realm—both the divine clan and the demonic clan—are descendants of the Sovereign. However, throughout the entire Divine and Demon Realm, only the Sovereign succeeded in mastering both divine and demonic arts; no descendants achieved this feat.

The Divine and Demon Scripture was the ultimate treatise created by the Sovereign. Even after his passing within the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave, he never passed it on to his descendants.

His descendants once harbored prodigies who sought the path of divine and demonic cultivation, but all perished without success. From that moment on, the divine and demonic clans gradually diverged—each specializing in either divine or demonic arts. Thus, they became irreversibly separated.

Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan recalled the records of the Sovereign, their faces etched with admiration. They marveled at his audacity in fusing two extremes of power within himself. Even those who single-mindedly pursued one path had become the strongest races in the Divine and Demon Realm. If the Sovereign truly mastered both, Luo Tian could not fathom how formidable he must have been.

“Ugh…” As people murmured, a series of mournful cries echoed from within the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave. The atmosphere grew chilling, sending shivers down their spines.

Chapter 1063: Entering the Ancient Cave

Outside the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave, wails of sorrow resonated in people’s minds. The sound was unnervingly eerie.

Though it would be tolerable elsewhere, the origin of these cries from within the cave made people uneasy.

“Haha!” After some time, a series of cold laughs followed the wails. The sound deepened their unease.

“Those cries and laughter clearly come from one person. Could there be someone still inside the Divine and Demon Cave?” A senior elder of a major sect, his eyes filled with intense apprehension.

“Hum…” As people discussed, the Divine and Demon Cave itself underwent a dramatic transformation. At times, it was illuminated by divine light, blazing the stars into brilliance; at other times, it turned pitch-black, resembling an endless abyss. Once inside, one would be utterly consumed.

“Divine and Demon Convergence!” People’s faces lit up with joy. All bore expressions of exhilaration.

“Unbelievable, we’ve caught the Divine and Demon Convergence!” Several elders of major sects gleamed with excitement.

“Luck’s on our side,” Luo Tian mused, gazing at the flickering Divine and Demon Cave.

The Divine and Demon Cave was a place of Divine and Demon Convergence. On days of divine power, it radiated resplendent light; on demonic days, the seas of demons roared. Divine days were relatively safe, but demonic days were perilous beyond measure—no chance of survival. Yet the Convergence only lasted a single day, with divine and demonic forces each claiming one day. Thus, people had just one day to enter the cave.

A single day—fleeting as a blink. In the past, both divine and demonic clans had explored the cave but failed to succeed. Divine days were merely safer than usual, not devoid of danger.

“Hum…” The sea of demons churned ceaselessly. The ancient cave transformed into a swirling vortex of black mist, with dark demonic energy spewing forth like serpents. They howled and shattered before retreating into the cave.

“Damn it, I’m not going in! My life’s too precious!” Many independent cultivators hesitated at the overwhelming demonic energy.

Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan stood among the crowd, their eyes wide with awe. Such dense demonic energy—regardless of whether they wished to enter or not, even a peak-level sage would perish instantly upon entry.

“Wait,” Jiang Nanxuan said. “The demonic day is too dangerous to enter. We must wait for the divine day. The divine and demonic clans haven’t arrived, nor has the Yin-Yang Sect. This is our best chance. If we truly obtain the Divine and Demon Scripture, it’ll be a massive gain!”

Several major sect elders gleamed with excitement. They waited for the Divine and Demon Convergence.

Many powerful independent cultivators also bore eager expressions. Without sects, they relied solely on themselves. The Divine and Demon Cave held unparalleled opportunities—everyone knew this. Finally, they had caught the Convergence; it was worth the risk.

Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan exchanged glances, nodding in agreement. They decided to take the risk; otherwise, with their current cultivation levels, they would never gain entry.

Time passed slowly. Under the expectant gazes of all, the dense black demonic energy gradually faded, like a transition between light and dark. Golden radiance slowly emerged, filling the cave with resplendent brilliance. People instinctively squinted their eyes.

After waiting an hour, when the last traces of demonic energy vanished, people could no longer contain their excitement. They surged forward like dragons toward the Divine and Demon Cave.

Figures darted as Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan silently followed the crowd into the cave. The vast entrance could accommodate hundreds or even thousands of people, but aside from a few major sects, only about a hundred independent cultivators chose to enter.

These individuals gathered together before entering. Major sects often exploited independent cultivators, using them as pawns—this was common.

Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan blended into the crowd, standing outside the cave. The golden light bathed everyone in warmth.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with violet energy as he gazed into the cave. But in an instant, blood trickled from his eyes, causing him to break out into a cold sweat.

“How are you?” Jiang Nanxuan stood beside Luo Tian, noticing the blood. He sighed in relief upon realizing Luo Tian had only sustained minor injuries.

“I couldn’t see beyond ten feet. The golden divine light wounded me!” Luo Tian shook his head, his voice laced with admiration.

“Move!” Several major sect elders observed the independent cultivators grouping together. Their expressions darkened slightly; normally, they would have let these independent cultivators scout ahead. But now, it was impossible—only their own forces could proceed.

The major sects led the way. The independent cultivators wore smug expressions, following behind their sects.

But as people had barely taken a dozen steps, the cave’s entrance echoed with thunderous roars. They halted.

Next moment, a piercing sound of breaking air filled the space. A series of golden lights appeared in their vision.

“Flying swords!” Several major sect elders, at the forefront, remained vigilant. Upon sensing something amiss, they activated their defensive measures.

Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan tensed instantly. Golden light enveloped them.

Next moment, golden flying swords—like meteors—raced from the cave. They filled the entrance without gaps, leaving no chance of escape.

“Sacred Artifacts!” Luo Tian’s eyes widened. He gaped at the overwhelming swords, his expression filled with awe.

“Plop…” Blood splattered. The golden light reached them instantly, piercing through countless figures with the relentless rain of sacred flying swords.

“Epoch Bell!” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, summoning the Epoch Bell to shield himself and Jiang Nanxuan. He could sense the overwhelming sword intent on these golden swords—peak-level sages couldn’t withstand them.

Other major sect elders also grimaced, activating their protective measures to shield their people.

Those without defenses perished instantly. Peak-level sages couldn’t survive even two rounds, dying under the sword rain.

Blood filled the cave. The intense golden light purified the corpses of fallen masters, leaving only white smoke that drifted out of the cave’s entrance.

Luo Tian marveled at the independent cultivators dying one by one. Even within a dozen steps of entering, over a hundred had been slaughtered.

The major sects felt fear. They hadn’t gone far before so many died—peak-level sages were all wiped out. Only those with strong survival techniques remained.

After several rounds of sword rain, the number of people standing dropped to twenty-something. The major sects occupied fifteen.

The remaining were Luo Tian, Jiang Nanxuan, and two plump independent cultivators who held a golden umbrella to block the sword rain. Additionally, three youths in gray robes stood with solemn expressions, gazing into the cave’s depths as if contemplating whether to proceed.

“Ah…” Two peak-level sages screamed, fleeing toward the cave’s entrance. They had clearly been terrified by this round of sword rain.

“Is that the Epoch Bell?” While observing others, people also observed Luo Tian. One sect disciple recognized his Epoch Bell.

“Kid, I didn’t expect you to return!” A senior elder of a sect glared at Luo Tian’s Epoch Bell, his eyes filled with greed.

“Ruyi Sect?” Luo Tian recognized the elder who spoke first, a smirk on his face. He took two steps forward.

“Yes, I am Luo Tian. If you want the Epoch Bell, feel free to try!” Luo Tian saw no need for pretense. He stood there, his eyes flashing with cold determination as he addressed the major sects.

This was not outside the Divine and Demon Cave. Luo Tian had no fear of these sects joining forces. If they did, he could certainly fight them off, killing at least two sects. He knew they wouldn’t dare attack him; his previous battle against the Yin-Yang Sect’s four had been a perfect deterrent.

“Haha, enough. He’s already a dead man. No need to waste time on him!” The Ruyi Sect elder sneered, shaking his head. In his mind, Luo Tian wouldn’t live long regardless of the circumstances.

“Don’t worry; even if your entire Ruyi Sect perishes, I won’t die!” Luo Tian retorted. Though he wasn’t as skilled at verbal sparring as Gu Lei and Zheng Xin, he could easily handle this old man.

“You!” The elder’s face darkened. His gaze turned cold toward Luo Tian, but seeing the other sects merely watching for amusement, he swallowed his anger. They had only brought three people; even the Yin-Yang Sect’s four had nearly been killed by Luo Tian. How much more so for these three?

“Haha!” As the atmosphere grew tense, two sneers echoed in people’s ears.

Looking around, two plump figures were pulling swords from the ground into their storage rings.

“Luo Tian, these flying swords are sacred artifacts. If we take them all back to the Four Sacred Star Domains, we can form a formidable array. It could annihilate peak-level sages—perhaps even those near the Epoch level!” Jiang Nanxuan’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, shaking his focus.

Chapter 1064: Competing for Sacred Artifacts

Within the Divine and Demon Cave, Luo Tian and others stared in awe at the ground littered with countless sacred flying swords.

“If we take these back to the Four Sacred Star Domains and equip our people, they could form a formidable array capable of annihilating peak-level sages—perhaps even those near the Epoch level!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke to Luo Tian, his voice filled with excitement.

“Collect them!” Upon hearing Jiang Nanxuan’s words, Luo Tian’s eyes flickered. He extended his hand to gather the swords on the ground—but they remained unmoved. His storage ring’s power couldn’t retrieve them.

This idea was obvious to Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan; others would think the same. Several sect elders’ faces darkened as they began picking up the swords.

“Don’t collect directly. You must pull them one by one!” Soon, people discovered the trick.

“Hum…” Luo Tian pulled up a sword, which emitted a resonant hum. He placed it into his storage ring.

“Haha, we’ve struck gold!” The two plump figures gleamed with excitement, pulling swords from the ground into their rings.

Soon, all twenty-something figures at the cave’s entrance were bending over, pulling swords into their rings.

“One… two…” Luo Tian didn’t know how many he had collected. He kept bending over, placing them into his ring. Everyone was numbly collecting swords.

Time passed slowly. Initially, there were many sacred swords; people would step aside to collect others, as wasting time on competition would cost them.

But as time passed, the near ten thousand sacred swords were quickly collected by Luo Tian’s group.

“Hmm…” Luo Tian stood before a sword. A sect prince also stood in front of it, causing Luo Tian’s brow to furrow slightly. He glanced around; the area had become somewhat empty.

“My sword!” The sect prince grabbed it, placing it into his ring. He didn’t even glance at it before moving to the next target.

“Mine first! Give it back!” Luo Tian extended his hand, grabbing the sect prince and pulling him forward. He struck the sect prince with a golden hand.

“My things are yours to steal? Give it back, or you’ll die!” Luo Tian’s voice was cold as he glared at the sect prince.

“Luo Tian! Don’t push your luck! These are unclaimed items. Whoever gets them first owns them!” The sect elder’s face darkened, addressing Luo Tian.

“Oh, unclaimed?” Luo Tian smiled. He had been tricked by these sects before—this was the same group that had attacked him.

“Boom!” A golden hand descended, striking the sect prince into pieces. At the same time, Dao power surged, attaching to the sect prince’s flesh. In a moment, he turned into white smoke.

“Clang…” The silver ring fell to the ground. The sect prince was annihilated in Luo Tian’s hands.

“This ring is now unclaimed. I found it first, so it belongs to me!” Luo Tian weighed the ring in his hand, addressing the sect elder.

Luo Tian’s speed was fast. The elder had no time to react. Moreover, they didn’t believe Luo Tian would dare offend them after having already offended the Yin-Yang Sect. If he offended all, leaving the Divine and Demon Realm would be difficult.

The sect elder’s face darkened. He stared at Luo Tian, speechless for a moment. Wanting to fight back, but he was only a peak-level sage. Facing Luo Tian, a prodigy with such achievements, what chance did he have?

Others also grimaced at Luo Tian. Their expressions were heavy; it seemed Luo Tian was truly fearless. Sacred swords were one thing, but if he encountered something truly formidable, he would be their greatest threat. In terms of personal strength, Luo Tian was undoubtedly the strongest among them.

They exchanged glances, each guessing their thoughts. Their auras subtly spread, hinting at a potential alliance.

“Ah, they’ve joined forces?” Luo Tian observed the group of ten standing together. His gaze swept over them, a mocking expression on his face. His battle spirit gradually rose.

“Ready for mutual destruction?” Luo Tian spoke softly, gripping his spear and standing beside Jiang Nanxuan.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the ten men’s faces slightly changed. The Ruyi Sect elder finally spoke: “This is the Divine and Demon Cave; it’s not advisable to fight here. However, if you dare defy our sect’s authority, we’ll eliminate you even at great cost!”

“Count on it!” Seeing the ten men’s battle spirit dissipate, Luo Tian sheathed his spear and stood there. He didn’t continue collecting the flying swords.

It wasn’t that Luo Tian didn’t want to collect. When he and the ten men confronted each other, two plump independent cultivators and three youths in gray robes had already thoroughly cleaned up the swords.

“You, that plump one. I’m talking to you. Our sect recently established a new peak and needs some sacred swords for support. Borrow ten thousand of them!” The Ruyi Sect prince addressed the plump man.

Other sect elders also brightened. Luo Tian was too much to handle, but these others were manageable.

“Those in gray robes—why act so cold? I’ve been short on funds lately. Borrow some sacred swords from me. When my finances improve, find me at the Four Sacred Star Pavilion; I’ll return them to you!” Other sect princes smiled, approaching these two groups.

Three sect elders of peak-levels stood behind them. After all, it was embarrassing to be seen as the ones losing.

“Did you see that? These are major sects. What’s the difference between them and bandits?” Luo Tian sneered, standing with Jiang Nanxuan in a corner. He had no intention of helping.

“Sir prince, these are the ones we risked our lives to obtain. Don’t try to take them!” Two plump youths showed fear, stepping back a few steps and distancing themselves from the two princes.

“Are you trying to steal from us?” Three youths in gray robes narrowed their eyes, scanning the three princes before them.

“Where’s the stealing? It’s clearly borrowing. We said we’d return them, right? Just give it to me. I’ll even give you interest! When you get to the Four Sacred Star Pavilion, everything will be returned!” The three princes were all peak-level sages. They had no fear of these independent cultivators, speaking with arrogance—completely different from their demeanor when facing Luo Tian.

“Can’t take on Luo Tian, so you’re coming after us? Do I look that easy to bully?” The three youths replied coldly, unafraid of the three princes.

Luo Tian watched the three gray-robed youths with interest. His instincts told him these two plump men and the three youths were no ordinary people.

“Watch the show! I bet these sects will suffer a big loss this time. Those who survived that attack—how many of them are simple?” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly beside Luo Tian.

“Why do you want to fight?” The two plump men kept stepping back, as if truly afraid of the two princes.

The two princes smiled, watching the plump men’s fearful expressions. They enjoyed others’ fear, and without realizing it, they followed the plump men forward.

“Ten feet away. In a blink, these two plump men would have stepped out of the Divine and Demon Cave when they finally stopped.”

“Give it to me! Hand over the sacred swords, or I’ll let you live and continue deeper into the cave!” The two princes looked down on the plump men.

“We’ll fight you!” One plump man’s face showed madness, as if ready to die. His hand flashed with golden light and struck the prince before him.

The attack wasn’t strong, but when the prince saw the weapon in the plump man’s hand, he sneered.

“What is this? A hoe?” The prince laughed, looking at the golden hoe in the plump man’s hand with disdain.

“Boom…” Next moment, the golden hoe struck the prince. His face changed instantly; his body trembled unnaturally.

A cold death qi spread from the prince. Next moment, that unassuming hoe—like a farmer’s tool—suddenly changed color, as if opening its maw to devour the world. In a blink, it devoured the prince’s life force, turning him into a corpse.

“Boom…” The plump man kicked the corpse of the prince aside, spat once, and grabbed the prince’s storage ring.

The other plump man had already finished his opponent. He moved like an invisible wind, rotating around the prince. His fingers flashed with cold light.

Blood splattered; in a blink, the prince was torn apart. He screamed endlessly, being smashed into pieces by the other plump man’s hoe. His life force was gone.

“This!” Luo Tian’s face showed shock. Though he had expected it, he hadn’t anticipated these two plump men’s methods were so strange.

“Die!” Three peak-level elders’ faces turned green. They hadn’t expected their princes to be so weak, dying instantly without a chance to fight.

Three peak-level elders became completely frenzied. Their princes’ deaths would surely bring heavy punishment upon returning to their sects.

Chapter 1065: The Heaven-Transcending Divine and Demon Flower

At the entrance of the Divine and Demon Cave, Luo Tian and others marveled at the two plump men standing at the entrance. They hadn’t expected these seemingly harmless men to so easily kill two princes.

“Kid, you’re dead!” Three peak-level elders’ faces darkened. They rushed toward the two plump men, their violent auras colliding with the cave’s golden walls, producing thunderous sounds.

“Haha, no more playing. We’ll wait for you inside!” The two plump men smiled upon seeing the three peak-level elders. Their feet rippled with energy, and in a blink, they vanished from the spot.

“Hmm?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow. His eyes widened with anger.

“Coward!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, watching the two plump men disappear. He finally remembered why these two men’s escape technique felt so familiar—these were the same people who had previously surrounded him and attacked him with many sect disciples: Zhang Kemin and the thin youth who had tried to steal his storage ring.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian gritted his teeth, another battle erupted. Three gray-robed youths faced three princes, unafraid. Their bodies were enveloped in grey mist, and their chaotic divine power was unleashed as powerful martial arts. They struck the three princes.

“Chaotic Domain?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, sensing these three’s attack methods resembled those of Zeng Tianshou from the Ancient Palace. However, he wasn’t certain these three were from the Chaotic Domain. After all, even when the Ancient Palace emerged, no one had seen anyone from the Chaotic Domain. He had never met anyone else from it besides Zeng Tianshou.

While Luo Tian pondered, the six combatants reached a fever pitch. Three Chaotic Domain youths were enveloped in grey chaos divine power, appearing as masters of their domain. Wherever the grey mist touched, they were invincible.

“Kill!” Three elders behind them saw their princes being suppressed. Their faces slightly changed, recalling the previous princes who had been killed. They feared their own princes would meet a similar fate and unleashed violent auras, attacking the three gray-robed youths.

The three Chaotic Domain youths saw the elders approaching. Their faces slightly changed. Though they could overpower the three princes, with so many peak-level elders, they weren’t arrogant enough to ignore this.

“Go!” They had intended to leave the Divine and Demon Cave. Now, there was no hesitation. Their bodies flashed with energy, becoming three grey lines that instantly burst out of the cave.

“Where did these people come from? They’re so strong. Why hadn’t we heard of them before?” The three princes, saved by the elders, panted heavily. They stared at the disappearing figures with fear.

“Let’s go. It’s not worth it,” Luo Tian said to Jiang Nanxuan, stepping forward into the cave. His expression returned to solemnity.

The elders of several major sects also wore expressions of admiration, regrouping and proceeding into the cave’s depths. Now that these three princes were dead, their sects had no choice but to retrieve treasures; otherwise, they would face heavy punishment.

They moved cautiously forward. A hundred feet—people took an hour to cover this distance. This was like a snail’s pace compared to their cultivation levels.

“Huff…” A gust of wind blew, resonating in everyone’s minds. Luo Tian and others stopped.

“Haha!” Laughter echoed, reverberating in the empty cave. Luo Tian’s nerves tensed again instantly. He summoned his Epoch Bell, enveloping himself and Jiang Nanxuan.

“Come on!” A voice filled with temptation echoed in their ears. Next moment, the world seemed to change.

Birds sang and flowers bloomed; a serene scene with creatures playing joyfully. People felt an overwhelming sense of peace.

“An illusion!” As the environment transformed, people sensed they had entered an illusion. Their gazes became more cautious.

“This is a crude illusion. It doesn’t match the Divine and Demon Cave’s illusions!” Luo Tian was puzzled, gazing around. Though it could be mistaken for reality, with their cultivation levels, they could sense it was an illusion.

“Something’s wrong. There must be something off!” Jiang Nanxuan muttered, clearly sensing this simple illusion was more complex than it seemed.

“This may be a natural illusion array!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face showed confusion, gazing around. His expression slightly changed.

“Natural?” Upon hearing Jiang Nanxuan’s words, Luo Tian and the major sects’ faces also slightly changed. A naturally formed array seemed simple but was elusive, difficult to break.

“What do we do? This is the Divine and Demon Cave. If we use brute force to break it, the disturbance might cause something unexpected!” Luo Tian whispered to Jiang Nanxuan. After all, Jiang Nanxuan was a master of arrays; his array skills were no worse than Wan Lingkong.

Jiang Nanxuan furrowed his brow, walking through the illusion. The more he walked, the less concerned he seemed—his expression even showed a hint of joy.

“Luo Tian! I found the Heaven-Transcending Divine and Demon Flower!” Jiang Nanxuan whispered to Luo Tian, causing his heart to stir. His eyes also showed excitement.

The Heaven-Transcending Divine and Demon Flower was the main reason Luo Tian had come to this cave. Now that he had found it, how could he not be excited? If Jiang Nanxuan wasn’t at least 80% certain, he wouldn’t have said this.

“If I’m not mistaken, this illusion array was created by the Heaven-Transcending Divine and Demon Flower. So if we find the array’s core, we’ll find the flower. Naturally, this illusion array will be broken!” Jiang Nanxuan whispered.

Luo Tian furrowed his brow, recalling the records of the Heaven-Transcending Divine and Demon Flower. This rare herb could evolve into an immortal medicine. Such a supreme elixir always had self-preservation methods. One of the Heaven-Transcending Divine and Demon Flower’s methods was an illusion array—higher levels meant more difficult to break.

From the current situation, Jiang Nanxuan also felt it was challenging. Thus, this Heaven-Transcending Divine and Demon Flower might have already reached the immortal medicine level. To harvest it would be extremely difficult, as immortal medicines were almost like living beings—some even attacked people. It was incredibly hard to catch, even for an Epoch-level sage. After all, only the Epoch Sovereign had the right to possess such things.

“Can it be broken?” Luo Tian whispered, his voice urgent. Regardless, they needed to find the Heaven-Transcending Divine and Demon Flower first before figuring out other plans.

“Fifty percent,” Jiang Nanxuan shook his head, voice calm. He raised a array flag.

“Use your Purple Extreme Demon Eyes to find the places in this illusion that contain Dao traces. I believe you can do it!” Jiang Nanxuan replied, his gaze on Luo Tian.

“Okay,” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate. His purple eyes flashed with divine light, scanning around.

“This is it!” Luo Tian had mastered Dao power. He quickly found a mountain peak with Dao traces.

Jiang Nanxuan planted the golden array flag on the peak. He followed Luo Tian, moving through the illusion with array flags flying from his hands. Their speed increased.

“What are they doing? Are they breaking the array?” Other sects watched Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan’s actions, their gazes filled with confusion.

“Two backwater people from the Four Sacred Star Domains. What do they know about arrays? If they can break it, that’s a miracle! I say just use brute force to break this illusion. Relying on them is better than trying to fight it!” The Ruyi Sect prince sneered, watching Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan disappear from their sight.

But before the Ruyi Sect prince’s words finished, Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed in their ears.

“If you don’t want to die, shut up. If you dare touch this illusion array, I’ll kill you first!” Luo Tian’s voice was overwhelming. The Ruyi Sect prince felt a chill, unable to continue speaking. He stayed put.

“Watch this. That kid has some skills. Didn’t he break the Yin-Yang Sect’s Soul-Devouring Flag with an array before? His array skills must be no small feat!” Several sects whispered, not attacking but moving toward Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian felt his eyes sore. Jiang Nanxuan had scattered countless array flags. Finally, Luo Tian stopped and said to Jiang Nanxuan: “No more. I can’t find any!”

After half a day, they had traversed the illusion and found all places with Dao traces.

“Hmm, I felt it too!” Jiang Nanxuan smiled. His consciousness sensed the array flags he had placed. His hands flickered slightly.

Golden light flashed, array flags emitting golden radiance. Jiang Nanxuan activated them. The golden light spread and converged into a golden dragon, soaring toward the sky as if trying to break through some cage.

“Follow this golden dragon. If nothing goes wrong, we’ll soon find the Heaven-Transcending Divine and Demon Flower’s location!” Jiang Nanxuan whispered to Luo Tian. They moved, following the golden dragon into the sky.

Chapter 1066: Jiang Nanxuan’s Misfortune

Within the Divine and Demon Cave’s illusion, Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan soared into the air, following the golden dragon.

“They found it. Follow them!” Several sects saw Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan chasing the golden dragon. Their faces slightly changed, and they all rose to follow.

Luo Tian naturally knew about these tails. He smiled but didn’t bother them. After all, if the Heaven-Transcending Divine and Demon Flower had truly advanced to an immortal medicine, they might need these people’s help.

“Roar…” The golden dragon roared as it circled the sky for an hour. Finally, it suddenly dove toward a patch of grass that seemed unremarkable.

“Catch him!” Jiang Nanxuan, filled with excitement, rushed toward the patch of grass.

Luo Tian was faster. Before Jiang Nanxuan’s words finished, he appeared before the grass and grabbed it.

“Hum…” Just as Luo Tian’s hands were about to touch the grass, it slightly trembled and emitted radiant light.

A black and white aura emerged from the grass. Next moment, it detached from the ground.

“That’s!” As this happened, several sects also arrived at the valley. They watched the grass rising into the air.

“Hum…” The environment changed abruptly. Mountains and forests vanished, replaced by golden walls in their sight.

“Broken!” Several sects marveled. Their faces lit up with joy, then they gazed at Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan. Their gazes were suddenly fixed on them.
