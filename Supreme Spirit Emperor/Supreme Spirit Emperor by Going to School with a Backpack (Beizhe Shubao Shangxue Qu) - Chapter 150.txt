As Long Jie suddenly ascended to the Realm-Transcendent Stage, the two disciples of the Tianshi Sect who had faced him—half-Realm-Transcendent Stage masters—were crushed under the terrifying aura of his cultivation, disintegrating into swirling mist of blood.

“Ha ha! Lord Wangyue, the Tianyuan Continent has gained another Realm-Transcendent Stage master. Now, what do you have left to contend with us?” Yin Tianxiong’s face bore a faint smile as his fan swept through the void, forming an icy mountain that radiated overwhelming might. With a thunderous crash, it collided with Yang Huanyu.

Zhang Daotian wielded the Sword of Heavenly Dao Thunder, his body resembling a thunder god encircled by lightning. His face softened as he gently caressed the sword, slicing through space to strike Yang Huanyu.

A long staff soared through the sky; the Demon Lord, like an undefeated war god, radiated golden light as he swept toward Yang Huanyu.

As the battle continued, the three Realm-Transcendent masters launched their assaults, clashing with Yang Huanyu and his former incarnation of Lord Wangyue in the void.

Though the three Realm-Transcendent masters possessed immense power, their age was evident. In contrast, Yang Huanyu’s vitality was robust; he met the three without fear, wielding the Tongming War Halberd. His aura was overwhelming, and the halberd radiated destructive might as he clashed with them.

Yet, upon Long Jie’s ascension to the Realm-Transcendent Stage, Yang Huanyu’s expression darkened. Facing three Realm-Transcendent masters was manageable, but with an additional one—especially a dragon clan member—it proved overwhelming. Even Yang Huanyu, renowned for his strength, struggled to withstand the onslaught.

“Roar!” Long Jie let out a thunderous cry, his golden dragon body spiraling into the void. Entering the battlefield besieged by Zhang Daotian and his allies, his massive dragon eyes glowed with icy malice.

“Long Jie has ascended to the Realm-Transcendent Stage?” The people of Tianyuan Continent’s faces lit with exhilaration. Their gazes turned to the void, as if invigorated by a surge of energy, their voices roaring as they charged at the Tianshi Sect’s forces.

They knew: the final victor would be decided by Realm-Transcendent masters. If Zhang Daotian’s group failed, the Tianyuan Continent would have no hope—such masters could annihilate common cultivators with a mere gesture. Only those at the魂凝境 (Soul-Consolidation Stage) stood a slim chance of survival.

“Damn it!” Yang Huanyu’s face darkened, his gaze cold as he stared at the four Realm-Transcendent masters.

“Luo Tian is safe and even stronger!” Long Jie’s voice echoed like rolling thunder across the battlefield, shaking the Tianyuan Continent’s people once more.

“Stronger!” Hearing Long Jie’s words, Yin Tianxiong, Zhang Daotian, and the Demon Lord trembled slightly. Their eyes held a flicker of excitement; they understood what Long Jie’s words signified.

“Another Luo Tian… this thorn in our side, yet he survived even after such grievous wounds!” Yang Huanyu’s gaze narrowed. Though wary, there was no fear in his expression.

“Though early, if I can hold out for a while—just an hour will suffice!” Yang Huanyu murmured, his gaze fixed on the blood-red moon now nearing fullness. His body emitted a series of resonant sounds.

“Return, my sovereign!” Yang Huanyu bellowed, his hand seals forming an immense destructive force that struck the former incarnation of Lord Wangyue.

“Boom!” Under Zhang Daotian’s group’s gaze, the formidable Lord Wangyue’s body exploded into a maelstrom of violent energy, surging into the void.

Yang Huanyu inhaled deeply, absorbing the blood essence of the Realm-Transcendent masters into his body. His third eye cracked open, revealing a blood-red gaze that sent shivers down the spine.

After absorbing the blood essence, Yang Huanyu’s aura reached its zenith. Even Zhang Daotian’s group felt the oppressive pressure.

“Body-Transcendent Supreme! I should be able to endure for a while!” Yang Huanyu’s face bore satisfaction. The void around him shattered under the unbearable pressure of his body.

“Kill!” Seeing Yang Huanyu’s state, Zhang Daotian and the others showed no fear. Their eyes were cold as they flew toward him. Long Jie, newly ascended, also surged forward with a crushing force.

The deafening roar of battle resumed in the five-way clash, its terrifying fluctuations echoing through the fractured void. Even Soul-Consolidation Stage masters dared not approach.

…

In the North Sea Dragon Tomb, Luo Tian emerged calmly from a massive shell, his youthful appearance and deep eyes contrasting sharply with the frail old man he once was. The water dragon clan’s people surrounded him, their gazes laced with amusement.

“Who are you?” The water dragon clan’s masters bore expressions of disbelief. Luo Tian’s youthful visage was unrecognizable compared to the withered old man they had known.

“I am Luo Tian!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his deep gaze fixed on the void. Though obscured by endless seawater, his vision clearly saw the blood-red moon hanging high—its depths laced with urgency.

“Luo Tian? A friend of Xiang Tianming?” The water dragon clan’s people furrowed their brows, unable to fathom what old Xiang Tianming had discovered in the dragon tomb.

“You carry the aura of our water dragon clan!” Yet, they sensed Luo Tian’s overwhelming resentment toward their kind.

“Damn it! Chen Hai and the others were killed by you!” An elder’s face darkened as he glared at Luo Tian.

“At least you’re sharp. What of it? I have no time to waste with you lot—move aside!” Luo Tian sneered, his gaze laced with disdain. His voice carried the weight of a decree, shaking the water dragon clan’s hearts.

“Realm-Transcendent! This old man ascended to Realm-Transcendent in the dragon tomb!” The water dragon clan’s people gasped, their gazes fixed on Luo Tian.

Luo Tian said nothing. His heart was frantic; he needed to know the status of the Western Front. If he arrived too late and friends fell there, he would never forgive himself. With his current strength, he was confident in turning the tide of battle.

For he had become a half-Transcendent, his body no longer the original Five Elements Constitution but a Nine Attribute Constitution.

Indeed, the nine sons of Dragon Ancestor had transformed into nine meridians within him, granting not only a surge in power but also an unprecedented Nine Attribute Constitution. No one before or after had achieved this, for only the nine sons of Dragon Ancestor could accomplish such a feat.

“An upstart Realm-Transcendent dares to be arrogant in the North Sea Dragon Palace!” The elder’s face bore coldness. His own cultivation was at half-Realm-Transcendent, and combined with the water dragon clan’s strength underwater—double their power. Yet Luo Tian was a human, his abilities inevitably suppressed in water.

“Die!”

“Yes! You must die. Even if you are a friend of Xiang Tianming, killing our clan’s prodigies demands your death here in the endless North Sea!” The water dragon clan roared, their voices echoing like dragons beneath the waves.

“Don’t have time to deal with you lot!” Luo Tian shook his head, then leapt forward, appearing a thousand zhang away.

“Trying to flee? No chance! Children of the water dragon clan, follow me and slay this human who defiles our kin!” The elder transformed into a hundred-zhang-long green dragon, charging toward Luo Tian.

The other water dragon clan members also roared, transforming into long dragons behind him.

“Move aside!” Luo Tian’s voice rang out as he prepared his second step, but a surge of spiritual energy behind him sent countless martial arts and overwhelming might crashing toward him. The water waves surged, and Luo Tian’s eyes finally flashed with cold killing intent.

One word—vast waves shattered, returning to calm under Luo Tian’s voice.

“Reincarnation!” Luo Tian raised his fist, and a hundred-zhang-long Reincarnation Passage materialized beneath the sea. A massive suction force rose from it.

“Wum—” The humming sound echoed as nearly a hundred water dragon clan masters’ gray souls abruptly left their bodies. Their gray eyes brimmed with endless terror, sucked into the Reincarnation Passage.

“Don’t take it personally!” Luo Tian’s voice was cold, echoing across the North Sea depths. The sea creatures trembled in fear.

“The water dragon clan has suffered heavy losses!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, other clans in the North Sea were stunned. Their gazes bore fear as they turned toward Luo Tian’s direction.

At that moment, Luo Tian felt more terrifying than Xiang Tianming.

“Boy, well done. Your strength now surpasses mine slightly,” Xiang Tianming’s voice echoed as he appeared before Luo Tian, accompanied by Dong Yichen and Dong Yan’er.

Seeing the three, Luo Tian paused mid-step, his gaze laced with concern.

“Thank you, Master!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully, his gratitude for Xiang Tianming heartfelt.

“Don’t worry; the Tianyuan Continent hasn’t faced trouble yet. I merely feared that if a major battle erupted, these two would be in danger. So I brought them here to the North Sea.” Xiang Tianming, sensing Luo Tian’s concern, smiled.

Hearing this, Luo Tian exhaled deeply, his gaze turning to Dong Yichen and Dong Yan’er. They were his disciples; keeping them in the North Sea was safer.

“Is he your master?” Dong Yichen, sensing something from Xiang Tianming and Luo Tian’s words, asked with confusion.

Chapter 734: Blood Sacrifice of the Tianyuan Continent

Chapter 734: Blood Sacrifice of the Tianyuan Continent

Seeing Dong Yichen’s gaze, Luo Tian lightly patted his head and nodded.

“Master, you’re so sly! Pretending to be an old man!” Dong Yan’er’s small eyes brimmed with confusion. She couldn’t fathom how the mad old man had transformed into such youthfulness.

Luo Tian said nothing, gently patting Dong Yan’er’s head before addressing Xiang Tianming: “Master, please take care of these two.”

“Lao Ba, come forward!” As Xiang Tianming appeared, the dragon palace’s masters also rushed to Luo Tian and Xiang Tianming. Their faces bore awe, stunned by Luo Tian’s might. Seeing the water dragon clan members’ bodies without souls but still intact, they trembled in fear.

“In!” A bearded elder appeared before Xiang Tianming, bowing respectfully. He was Xiang Tianming’s loyal follower, his cultivation at half-Realm-Transcendent.

“From today on, you shall be the Dragon Palace’s Grandmaster. My only demand is that you protect these two children well. If anything happens, you shall sever your head yourself!” Xiang Tianming spoke with authority, his gaze stern.

“Yes!” The elder bowed respectfully, confidence in his eyes. Their octopus clan was a major faction within the dragon palace. Now that the water dragon clan had been crippled by Luo Tian, their strength was but a tenth of before. Few could rival them, and those few were Xiang Tianming’s loyalists. The elder was confident in managing the dragon palace.

“Master?” Luo Tian’s face bore confusion, puzzled by why this man who cared little for human lives would make such arrangements.

“Ah… it’s because of these two kids! If not for them, would I care about humans? These years, the beasts of the North Sea have died in human hands to a terrifying extent. To help humans, even you lack such influence!”

Xiang Tianming spoke coldly.

“Haha…” Dong Yan’er’s face bore a mischievous smile as she winked at Luo Tian.

“Thank you, Master!” Luo Tian bowed to Xiang Tianming. With a Realm-Transcendent master on their side, the Tianyuan Continent’s chances of victory were greater.

“Enough talk—hurry up! I’m sure you’re eager to go!” Xiang Tianming said nothing, then took a step and vanished.

Luo Tian’s face bore a faint smile, yet his eyes were icy: “Yang Huanyu, how will you contend with the entire Tianyuan Continent’s forces?”

“You two must strive!” Luo Tian spoke, then vanished.

…

In the Western Front of the Tianyuan Continent, the battlefield was awash with blood. After two days of fighting, both sides suffered heavy losses. The Tianyuan Continent alone had lost tens of thousands at the Soul-Consolidation Stage, while the Wangyue Sect had lost over two thousand half-Realm-Transcendent masters.

Worse still, the body-transformation disciples had been overburdened by two days of battle. While Soul-Consolidation Stage masters could harness the world’s spiritual energy, body-transformation and bone-fusion disciples relied solely on their own spiritual energy—consuming an immense amount over two days.

The Soul-Consolidation Stage battle was no better; Gu Qianxue, Gu Lei, and Tian Luo—masters who had glimpsed chaos power—struggled against half-Realm-Transcendent masters. For now, the Tianshi Sect held a clear advantage.

The only relief was the Realm-Transcendent battle: Zhang Daotian, the Demon Lord, Yin Tianxiong, and now Long Jie. Though Yang Huanyu was a half-Transcendent, he was still just that—overpowered by four masters.

“Ten… five…”

Yang Huanyu was thrown into the void, his body bloodied and weary. Yet he muttered the time aloud.

“One…” Yang Huanyu shouted, his gaze fixed on the blood-red moon.

“Finally!” The Wangyue Sect’s people bore expressions of excitement, their eyes burning with fervor.

“Hmph! Zhang Daotian, the Demon Lord—your scheming has achieved nothing. Today, I shall perform a blood sacrifice on the Tianyuan Continent, awakening the Epoch Book to ascend my throne and lead the Wangyue Sect into the Immortal Realm!” Yang Huanyu’s gaze held mockery as his hands moved swiftly.

“Hmph?” Zhang Daotian and the others bore confusion, unable to fathom what Yang Huanyu had left. Yet they refused him any chance to act, their bodies flashing toward him.

But as they leapt into the void, Yang Huanyu’s hand seals completed. His three eyes bore a sinister expression as he gazed at the blood-red moon.

“Go!” Yang Huanyu bellowed, his hands moving. The spiritual energy from the countless dead cultivators on the Western Front surged upward, instantly filling the sky with a thick blood-red dragon that converged toward Yang Huanyu.

“Do you think the war erupted for what?” Yang Huanyu sneered, his hand patting to absorb the spiritual energy into his body.

“Wum—” The fluctuation spread, Yang Huanyu’s wounds from his battle with Zhang Daotian and the others healing rapidly. His body radiated red light, bathed in blood energy.

Thousands of cultivators’ spiritual energy flowed into Yang Huanyu, his face bearing a dazed expression.

“Crack…” A sound of something breaking echoed within Yang Huanyu’s body, sending the battlefield into shock.

“True Body-Transcendent Supreme!” Zhang Daotian and the others bore expressions of shock. Yang Huanyu had been a Body-Transcendent Supreme before, but through special methods—his strength wouldn’t last long.

Not only Yang Huanyu, but his remaining disciples also bore dazed expressions, seated before him. Their bodies emitted booming sounds.

Two days of battle had cost the Tianyuan Continent half its forces, with countless deaths creating spiritual energy that Yang Huanyu and his disciples absorbed in mere moments.

Five Realm-Transcendent masters had ascended, their strength terrifying.

“Damn it! He was acting all along—using the spiritual energy from combat to elevate himself and his subordinates!” Yin Tianxiong spoke solemnly.

“Still has some wit! But do you think my goal was merely a half-Transcendent? You’re not enough!” Yang Huanyu sneered, his hand patting to emit golden light.

Golden radiance illuminated the black and red sky, revealing the dark Western Front to the people’s eyes.

“Vomit…” The tension of battle had kept people from noticing, but now that the battlefield paused, Tianyuan Continent disciples bore fearful expressions. Some vomited at the sight of corpses piled like mountains.

“Epoch Book!” Zhang Daotian, the Demon Lord, and Yin Tianxiong bore wary expressions. The Epoch Book was mysterious; even Realm-Transcendent masters didn’t know its purpose. Yet they knew it would bring no good to the Tianyuan Continent in Yang Huanyu’s hands.

“Begin! Blood Sacrifice!” Yang Huanyu raised his hand, his third eye glowing red. It pierced the void toward the blood-red moon.

“Wum—” As if stimulated, the blood-red moon glowed fiercely, emitting blinding red light. Countless runes flew from it, scattering across the Tianyuan Continent.

“Boom… boom… boom…” As the blood runes fell, the people of the Tianyuan Continent cried out. Each person struck by a rune turned into a mist of blood, soaring toward the Western Front.

“Wum—” A massive suction force emanated from the Epoch Book’s pages, golden books flipping with a哗啦 sound.

Countless spiritual energies condensed into blood-red dragons, flowing into the Epoch Book. The entire Tianyuan Continent was filled with cries of anguish and screams of despair.

“Don’t waste time! Use this spiritual energy to ascend to the Transcendent Stage!” Yang Huanyu moved his hands, pressing into the void. The Western Front erupted with fluctuations.

“Formation!” Jiang Nanxuan, standing among the crowd, felt the familiar fluctuation and bore a shock.

“Soul-Consolidation Formation!” Yang Huanyu bellowed, the terrifying fluctuation spreading across the Western Front. Simultaneously, countless souls of those struck by runes converged toward the Western Front.

These souls weren’t absorbed into the Epoch Book but directly toward Yang Huanyu.

“Don’t let him succeed! If he absorbs these souls and ascends to the Transcendent Stage, we’re doomed!” The Demon Lord spoke solemnly, his eyes wild as he transformed into a streak of light toward Yang Huanyu.

At the same time, Long Jie, Yin Tianxiong, and Zhang Daotian bore wild eyes, rushing toward Yang Huanyu who was absorbing souls.

“Haha! Zhang Daotian, come on! I never thought a little kid like you would reach the Realm-Transcendent before me!” Yang Huanyu’s five subordinates, newly ascended to the Realm-Transcendent Stage, smiled as they met Zhang Daotian.

Chapter 735: Clash Between Foes

Chapter 735: Clash Between Foes

The other five Wangyue Sect Realm-Transcendent masters also smiled, meeting the Demon Lord and Long Jie. Five Realm-Transcendent masters bore fierce battle intent, their spiritual energy and weapons radiating as they blocked the four at ten thousand zhang away from Yang Huanyu.

“Kill!” Zhang Daotian and the others were bloodthirsty, their mission to stop Yang Huanyu’s ascension urgent.

Jiang Nanxuan bore a fierce expression, standing among the crowd as he cast countless array flags from his hands. The Tianyuan Continent’s people were enclosed, a ninth-level formation instantly activated to prevent the blood runes from striking them.

“Yaoyue, I won’t forget you!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face bore tenderness as he retrieved his former body, a decisive expression on his face.

“Come on, let’s see how far my fusion with my former body can go!” Jiang Nanxuan murmured, his former body shattering in front of the crowd. Like Yang Huanyu, it transformed into endless spiritual energy, flowing into Jiang Nanxuan’s body.

“Roar…” A low roar echoed as Gu Lei, who had been absorbing poison in the Western Front’s outskirts, was enveloped by purple energy. His long hair flowed as he stepped forward, a purple domain forming before him and charging toward Zhang Daotian’s battlefield.

“Gu Lei has ascended to the Realm-Transcendent Stage!” Tian Luo and others bore shock. They hadn’t expected their average talent Gu Lei to be the first to reach the Realm-Transcendent Stage.

“Boom… boom…” A deep sound echoed as Jiang Nanxuan, calm and serene, slowly opened his eyes. Like a god-king, his white robe fluttered without wind as he stepped out of the ninth-level formation. He didn’t rush toward the ten-way battle but toward Yang Huanyu, who was absorbing souls.

“Half-Transcendent!” Even Zhang Daotian and the others bore shock, stunned by Jiang Nanxuan’s strength.

Indeed, Jiang Nanxuan’s soul was already at its peak. Combined with his former Realm-Transcendent body, he had fully ascended to the Half-Transcendent Stage.

“By my name Jiang Nanxuan, emerge! The Road of Reincarnation!” Jiang Nanxuan stood in the air, his face solemn as he extended five drops of blood. They vanished into the void.

“Wum—” Endless reincarnation passages appeared in people’s sight, not just the Western Front but across the entire Tianyuan Continent.

Gray reincarnation passages spanned the continent, their massive suction force sending the Tianyuan Continent’s people into cheers.

Countless souls were drawn into the reincarnation passages, and Yang Huanyu slowly opened his eyes, a cold killing intent in his gaze.

“Reincarnation Passage? Summoning such a long-distance passage—your strength must be weakened!” Yang Huanyu moved, instantly appearing before Jiang Nanxuan. His fist struck the void, shattering it.

Jiang Nanxuan bore a smile as he spoke: “Now I am at my peak. Even with the loss of five drops of blood, you still dream of killing me!” Jiang Nanxuan remained fearless, striking back.

The sky darkened, the void shattered, and a massive fluctuation sent the reincarnation passage trembling thrice.

Jiang Nanxuan’s figure became a streak of white light, vanishing from sight. In an instant, he reappeared in the void.

His white robe stained with blood, his face bore endless pride: “I used to stand behind others—this feeling was terrible. Now, with strength to protect those who protected me, I will not let you harm them even if it means facing a Transcendent!”

“Die!” Yang Huanyu’s body transformed into an ancient dragon, his form a streak of light as he rushed toward Jiang Nanxuan.

Jiang Nanxuan bore a hint of sorrow, gazing at Meng Yao within the formation. His spiritual energy ignited as his soul began to burn.

“No!” Meng Yao’s face was streaked with tears, her hands gripping the formation’s main flag. She longed to flee but couldn’t—she knew if she left, the formation might collapse.

“Kill!” Seeing Meng Yao’s excitement, Leng Qiuchan bore an endless killing intent. She transformed into a dark storm, breaking out of the formation to charge toward the remaining Tianshi Sect masters.

Others did likewise, their faces cold as they watched the blood energy flow into the Epoch Book. They knew it might contain their loved ones.

Those below the Soul-Consolidation Stage remained within the formation, understanding that this battle was beyond their reach.

The Wangyue Sect’s body-transformation and bone-fusion disciples were ignored by Yang Huanyu. Countless blood runes struck them, turning them into mist and drawing them into the Epoch Book.

“Boom…” As people roared, Yang Huanyu and Jiang Nanxuan clashed again. This time, Jiang Nanxuan was no longer desperate; having burned his soul, he had recovered to the Half-Realm-Transcendent Stage.

“Die!” Yang Huanyu’s eyes bore cruelty, his fists relentless.

“Die, and take you with me!” Jiang Nanxuan sneered, the two standing in the void, clashing endlessly.

Yet within moments, Jiang Nanxuan’s face turned pale as a sheet of paper, his body flying out of the void. His white robe was stained red with blood.

“This time, you’re dead! Compared to Luo Tian’s stubbornness, you still have a long way to go!” Yang Huanyu stepped out of the void, his form like a supreme king. He rushed toward Jiang Nanxuan with a blood-red fist, excitement on his face—half-Transcendent spiritual energy could accelerate the Epoch Book’s activation.

“Move aside…” A cold voice echoed from the void as a gray figure, streaking with light, appeared before Jiang Nanxuan. It struck back with a fist.

“Crack…” The two fists collided, sending another thunderous sound through the sky, hastening the death of the Wangyue Sect’s body-transformation and bone-fusion disciples.

Invisible fluctuations struck Jiang Nanxuan’s formation, emitting a piercing hum.

“I said it—following you was always bad luck. My god, so many have died!” An old voice echoed as a aged man appeared in the void, his face laced with fear.

“Luo Tian!” Hearing the familiar voice, Jiang Nanxuan’s face paled as he stood in the sky. A faint smile graced his face.

“Thank you, Brother Jiang!” Luo Tian waved his hand, sending Jiang Nanxuan into the formation.

“Luo Tian!” The people of the Tianyuan Continent erupted in excitement, their gazes burning as they looked at Luo Tian standing in the sky. His aura radiated terrifying fluctuations.

“Luo Tian!” Yang Huanyu’s face darkened as he gazed at Luo Tian, whose aura was no weaker than his.

“How about that? Surprised to see me?” Luo Tian’s face was like a nine-layered abyss, his gaze cold as he stared at Yang Huanyu.

After half a day of travel, Luo Tian and Xiang Tianming had finally reached the Western Front. Along the way, it was during the blood runes’ descent. Seeing the Tianyuan Continent littered with corpses, Luo Tian’s heart felt like it was being cut. Even Xiang Tianming, who had never cared about human lives, felt pity.

It was too bloody; Xiang Tianming now fully understood the Wangyue Sect’s true nature. If left unchecked, even the North Sea wouldn’t escape.

“Unexpectedly, you survived despite such injuries—still alive and kicking! You really are a cockroach; no matter how hard you hit, you never die!” Yang Huanyu’s face bore a smile.

“You’re the same! You remember how I once chased you like a dog?” Luo Tian spoke solemnly. Their battles had been evenly matched.

“Do you think your arrival makes a difference? No one can stop me from ascending to the Transcendent Stage, not even you!” Yang Huanyu spoke coldly, his blood-red spear materializing in his hand.

“Crackling Spear!” Luo Tian bellowed, a nostalgic expression on his face.

A black light flashed as the spear flew from Gu Qianxue’s storage ring, streaking out of the formation with a hum and appearing in Luo Tian’s hand.

“Wum—” The black spear emitted a humming sound, its resentment radiating toward Luo Tian. His face softened slightly.

“Haha, okay, okay—never again will I abandon you!” Luo Tian gently caressed his companion, the Crackling Spear, speaking softly.

“Kill!” Both Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu spoke simultaneously. As foes, they were eye to eye. Their weapons—spear and halberd—clashed toward each other, the Western Front once again erupting into a fiery state. The sky was no longer intact; vast gray voids appeared in the battlefield.

“Crackling Four Forms!”

“Tongyou Halberd!” The spear and halberd clashed endlessly. Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu continuously collided, their battle invisible to those below. Only flashes of light and powerful fluctuations could be seen, shaking Jiang Nanxuan’s formation.

“I’ll see what you can do now that you’ve reached Half-Transcendent!” Yang Huanyu’s face bore coldness as he planted his halberd in the void, his hands moving.

“I said it—without the Epoch Book, I’m still Luo Tian. And my things are never easily taken!” Luo Tian’s eyes were cold, sensing Yang Huanyu’s terrifying fluctuations. His hands moved in response.

Chapter 736: Shattering Reincarnation

Chapter 736: Shattering Reincarnation

The Tianyuan Continent’s Western Front.

Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu stood in the sky, both bearing killing intent as their hands radiated terrifying fluctuations.

“Soul-Annihilation Cauldron!” A gray cauldron formed in Yang Huanyu’s hands, radiating immense fluctuations toward Luo Tian.

“Soul-Stealing Seal!” The Soul-Stealing Seal, imbued with Luo Tian’s soul energy, flew out simultaneously. It radiated five-element fluctuations toward Yang Huanyu’s technique.

Both were Half-Transcendent masters—Luo Tian, soul-powerful; Yang Huanyu, body-powerful.

Their techniques radiated overwhelming might, colliding and sending waves of fluctuation that felled the Wangyue Sect disciples dodging blood runes.

“Crack…” The barrier protecting the Tianyuan Continent’s people emitted a series of cracks, on the verge of breaking.

“Strong!” The Tianyuan Continent’s people bore expressions of fear, gazing at the nine-level formation with slight cracks.

“Such a long distance—just the fluctuations have shattered the formation!” The Tianyuan Continent’s disciples bore fear, but they couldn’t leave. To step out would mean certain death.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, sensing Jiang Nanxuan’s formation was unstable. He waved his hand, applying immense displacement force to the people within the formation.

“Wum—” The entire formation transported the remaining millions of body-transformation and bone-fusion disciples to the Western Front’s edge.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian bore a drop of sweat, his strength drained from displacing so many.

“Hmph! Fighting me and still have time to care about others?” Yang Huanyu’s cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. His halberd sliced through the void, instantly reaching Luo Tian.

In Yang Huanyu’s surprise, it struck Luo Tian.

“Shadow!” But a moment later, Yang Huanyu’s face changed. He moved swiftly, appearing ten thousand zhang away.

Yet Yang Huanyu was still too slow; his shoulder felt pain, a blood mark rising.

“Wum—” The fluctuation spread as Luo Tian’s figure appeared in Yang Huanyu’s sight. Like Yang Huanyu, Luo Tian also had a blood spot on his arm—evidently wounded by Yang Huanyu’s halberd.

On the other side, the Realm-Transcendent battlefield had been dominated by Xiang Tianming’s arrival. Zhang Daotian and the others, now six Realm-Transcendent masters, faced five of the enemy. They had them on the defensive—those five were only newly ascended to Realm-Transcendent.

Zhang Daotian and the others, except Long Jie and Gu Lei, were seasoned masters who had reached Realm-Transcendent for years. They were no match for those five.

Especially Xiang Tianming and Long Jie—Xiang Tianming transformed into a golden dragon, while Long Jie became a massive鲲鹏 (a mythical bird). Their presence made the enemy look desperate.

Other Soul-Consolidation Stage battles were evenly matched, causing Yang Huanyu’s brows to furrow.

“Worthless! All of you are worthless!” Yang Huanyu mentally cursed, his face bearing a smile as he addressed Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian, I’ll give you one last chance to surrender! I promise not to harm your family and friends. Together, we’ll enter the Immortal Realm and forever reign over it! What do you say?” Yang Huanyu’s gaze held temptation.

“Haha, if you can resurrect all those who died in the Tianyuan and Xiangu Continents, I’ll accept! If not, blood debts must be repaid!” Luo Tian held the Crackling Spear, standing straight. His face bore endless coldness.
