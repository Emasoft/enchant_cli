“What’s going on!” As Zhu Ge Huangchao was hurled backward, the crowd's faces bore expressions of astonishment. They gazed at the emaciated figure of Si Ma Tuo, unable to fathom how such a frail body could conceal such terrifying power.

“Si Ma Tuo, he’s so strong!” Zhou Wei and Yan Hongtao exclaimed in disbelief, staring at Si Ma Tuo.

They knew Zhu Ge Huangchao’s strength. Even Yan Hongtao, years ago, had struggled to gain the upper hand against him. Though Zhu Ge Huangchao’s power had waned slightly over the years, he remained among the Nine Realms’ elite.

Yet Si Ma Tuo was merely a thief in their eyes—sneaking, insignificant. Now, he had shattered Zhu Ge Huangchao with a single punch. This spectacle was horrifying; the sheer might of Si Ma Tuo’s meager frame alone was terrifying.

“Could he be one of the Nine Ancestral Beasts?” Sun Miechen’s eyes darkened with concern. He could have repelled Zhu Ge Huangchao, but he was in the Mid-Epoch while Si Ma Tuo was only in the Early Epoch. That meant Si Ma Tuo was even more formidable.

“Die!” Zhu Ge Huangchao’s eyes flashed with cold light. His hands moved, and a surge of chaotic energy erupted.一道道青色的雷霆交织而起, converging toward him.

“Chaos Sword!” The thunder coalesced into a brilliant blue blade. The surrounding gray mist seeped into the sword, radiating an overwhelming aura as chaos energy swirled within it.

A flash of blue light illuminated Zhu Ge Huangchao’s face, making it grotesque. With a wave of his hand, the blue thunder sword cleaved through the first layer of the ancient celestial palace, descending upon Si Ma Tuo with a roar.

“Dao Without Borders!” Si Ma Tuo’s gaze darkened as he faced the world-shaking strike. Yet, his eyes soon blazed with battle fervor. He gripped the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, embodying a legendary warrior as streaks of blue lightning erupted from it.

Three thousand great paths of power surged into the thunderous light, radiating an awe-inspiring aura. They converged into a colossal storm of lightning, emitting a deafening hum as it clashed with the Chaos Sword.

In stunned silence, the world-shattering Chaos Sword collided with the storm of thunder, igniting the sky and filling the ancient celestial palace with wild energy.

“Sword Without Borders!” Before the crowd could react, a low voice echoed amidst the chaos. A flash of lightning appeared before Zhu Ge Huangchao’s wide-eyed gaze.

Si Ma Tuo had pushed his speed to its limit. In the Early Epoch, he was certain of victory—Zhu Ge Huangchao had no time to react.

“Pf!” Blood splattered as the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword pierced Zhu Ge Huangchao’s body, instantly draining his color.

Like a bolt of lightning, it pierced through Zhu Ge Huangchao’s chest, causing the onlookers to gasp in shock.

“Not simple! This Si Ma Tuo is definitely not ordinary!” Sun Miechen’s eyes narrowed, his gaze now heavy with concern as he looked at Si Ma Tuo.

“Foolish!” Zhu Jie’s face flashed with cold light. His body surged upward, and his overwhelming aura instantly stilled the wild thunder. He appeared behind Si Ma Tuo, slamming a palm toward his back.

“Even the Chaos Domain’s master would resort to underhanded tactics!” Jiang Nanxuan’s eyes flashed with coldness. His body released black and white energy, forming a massive hand that struck toward Zhu Jie.

“Get out of the way!” Si Ma Tuo spun around, throwing a punch that shattered space. The entire realm trembled as it collided with Zhu Jie’s palm.

The thunderous roar echoed. Zhu Jie’s eyes widened in disbelief, his body retreating several steps as cracks marred his palm. He gazed at Si Ma Tuo standing firm.

“Even Zhu Jie’s attack could be blocked!” Sun Miechen was more certain than ever—Si Ma Tuo, transformed into this man, was no ordinary opponent.

Chapter 1391: Overbearing Provocation

Though Si Ma Tuo had blocked Zhu Jie’s attack, he was no better off. His body flew backward, his mind heavy with concern as he stared at Zhu Jie, his hands trembling.

“Strong. Even against a Mid-Epoch prodigy, there’s still a gap,” Si Ma Tuo mused.

That strike had been purely brute force. Zhu Jie’s body type was equally astonishing, rendering Si Ma Tuo’s strength ineffective.

After calming his turbulent energy, Si Ma Tuo smiled: “It’s over. You’ve lost!”

“Cough… cough…” Zhu Ge Huangchao, pale-faced, returned to Zhu Jie’s side. His gaze burned with fury.

To him, he should have crushed this emaciated thief effortlessly. Yet now, in just two strikes, his heart had been pierced by the blue thunder sword, leaving him wounded. The terrifying lightning still roamed within his body.

“Truly a paper tiger! How dare you try to dominate others?” Zheng Xin and Diao Dezhu looked at Zhu Ge Huangchao with disdain. They had long anticipated this outcome.

Twenty years ago, Si Ma Tuo had subdued Zhu Ge Huangchao. Twenty years later, though he hadn’t entered the Mid-Epoch, they still believed Si Ma Tuo was invincible. Even Zhu Jie would meet his end before him. This was their faith in Si Ma Tuo, for he had never failed them.

“Unexpectedly, your combat power is remarkable. I underestimated you!” Zhu Jie’s hands flickered with gray energy, instantly restoring his composure. He smiled at Si Ma Tuo, stepping forward.

“Hah! Just a lucky strike. Since I won, let’s call it even!” Si Ma Tuo smiled, addressing the crowd.

“Cough… cough…” Upon hearing this, Zhu Ge Huangchao spat two more mouthfuls of blood.

“Lucky strike? You’ve been wounded so severely. If you had fought at your best, you’d have flown to the heavens!” Zhu Ge Huangchao mentally cursed, wishing to crush Si Ma Tuo. But if he spoke his mind, it would only humiliate himself.

“Si Ma Tuo, do you wish to test your strength against me? I’ve longed for a new opponent. My hands are itchy!” Zhu Jie’s eyes gleamed with amusement, but his gaze held a threat.

“You’ve gone too far! This is the Four Sacred Star Domains. Your earlier attack already violated our agreement. Now you’re bullying us—do you think we’ll let it slide?”

“I’ve also been itching for a fight. I’ll test your strength!” Jiang Nanxuan’s aura surged, his purple zither materializing before him. His gaze locked onto Zhu Jie.

“Strength rules!” Zhu Jie spoke four words, his eyes scanning Si Ma Tuo and the others with a smile. He took another step toward Si Ma Tuo.

The zither’s melody swept through the air. Jiang Nanxuan saw Zhu Jie hadn’t stopped, his eyes flashing coldness as he plucked the strings. Black and white energy swirled around his fingers, sending an invisible wave toward Zhu Jie.

“Crash…” The invisible wave struck Zhu Jie, who frowned slightly. His feet paused but he continued toward Si Ma Tuo.

“Disgraceful!” Long Jie snorted, spitting out imperial dragon energy that formed a five-clawed golden dragon, roaring toward Zhu Jie.

“Will you fight in numbers?” Zhu Jie’s eyes flashed with coldness. His aura surged as he met Jiang Nanxuan’s killing melody, throwing a punch that struck the golden dragon.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed again. Zhu Jie halted, and the fierce killing aura ceased. The golden dragon dissolved into view.

Zhu Jie stood still, his fists bleeding as he gazed with determination.

“Zhu Jie, you’ve overstepped! What business do you have here in the Four Sacred Star Domains?” Diao Dezhu and others shouted, their eyes burning with anger.

“Let’s settle this now. Who is the true top of the Nine Realms?” Zhu Jie glanced at Sun Miechen and Zhou Wei, then spoke softly.

“Challenge! To retreat is to admit inferiority!” The crowd’s hearts sank. They stared at Zhu Jie, their eyes turning cold.

“Fear you?!” Sun Miechen’s eyes flashed with coldness, his battle spirit ignited as he surveyed the group.

“Don’t fight here in our Four Sacred Star Domains!” Jiang Nanxuan coldly scolded, his voice devoid of warmth.

“Foolish! You think I fear you?” Si Ma Tuo’s eyes flashed with coldness. His anger had finally ignited.

From the start, the Four Sacred Star Domains had been patient. Yet these people hadn’t shown any signs of backing down—they’d grown bolder.

“Seems some must be crushed beneath our feet. Once isn’t enough, so we’ll do it twice!” Si Ma Tuo mused, stepping in front of Jiang Nanxuan.

“Don’t ruin the peace. I accept your challenge,” Si Ma Tuo spoke softly, “But let me warn you—should I unleash my full strength, I might injure you. Don’t blame me then!”

“Hah!” Zhu Ge Huangchao laughed, his eyes filled with contempt. “Defeating me doesn’t make you invincible! My brother could subdue you effortlessly!”

“This isn’t Si Ma Tuo!” Sun Miechen, Yan Hongtao, and Zhou Wei felt a strange familiarity as they observed Si Ma Tuo’s transformed aura. They immediately suspected this Si Ma Tuo wasn’t the real one.

“Who are you? Why does it feel so familiar… so deeply familiar?” Yan Hongtao, upon seeing Si Ma Tuo’s overwhelming aura, instinctively trembled.

Sun Miechen felt something ignite within him. His body’s dormant power slowly awakened, his gaze on Si Ma Tuo growing more intense.

“Indeed him!” Zhou Wei’s eyes gleamed with a smile. His gaze flickered with complex symbols as he had been calculating since entering the ancient celestial palace. Now, his revelation left him shaken.

“The Nine Realms are about to descend into chaos!” Zhou Wei mused, his gaze on the two standing together and exchanging glances.

“Perfect. Let’s see what strength these people possess now!” Si Ma Tuo’s eyes burned with battle spirit. He gripped the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, gazing at Zhu Jie.

“Good!” Zhu Jie laughed, vanishing from sight. In flight, a gray hand formed again, striking toward Si Ma Tuo.

“Get out of the way!” Facing Zhu Jie’s prodigy, Si Ma Tuo was fully alert. Two great arts converged as he threw a punch.

In an instant, their fists met, and wild waves of energy surged from the collision.

“Again!” Zhu Jie’s eyes darkened. The brief contact had erased his contempt, forcing him to regard Si Ma Tuo seriously.

“Fear you?!” Si Ma Tuo moved, his palm numb. He soared again toward Zhu Jie.

“Close combat—no match for Zhu Jie. His attack is incredibly powerful. It’s not the strength of an Early Epoch!” Sun Miechen observed Si Ma Tuo clashing with Zhu Jie, sensing the familiarity of his attacks.

“Impossible!” Sun Miechen immediately thought of a person with equally formidable power. He couldn’t help but exclaim, for that person had already died.

It wasn’t just Sun Miechen who felt the familiarity. Yan Hongtao also sensed it, a strange feeling stirring within him.

The thunderous sound never ceased. Si Ma Tuo clashed with Zhu Jie repeatedly, both possessing the Nine Ancestral Beasts—Reincarnation Body and Chaos Holy Body. Si Ma Tuo’s flesh was unmatched, but Zhu Jie had a level advantage. For now, neither could overcome the other.

As they clashed, their wounds multiplied. Si Ma Tuo sighed, acknowledging the gap between himself and a Mid-Epoch.

“If I were in the Mid-Epoch, I could subdue him,” Si Ma Tuo mused as he searched for the gap between himself and these people.

Zhu Jie, however, was in turmoil. He had always been undefeated, even against Sun Miechen. Yet this Early Epoch’s Si Ma Tuo had no solution for him, leaving Zhu Jie stunned by his opponent’s attacks.

Zhu Jie finally ignited anger. He knew relying on flesh alone would cost him dearly—this wasn’t what he wanted. He sought a decisive victory.

“Chaos True Luo Hand!” After another collision, Zhu Jie retreated. His hands formed a seal, and an ethereal gray figure suddenly rose from behind him. Like a life born from chaos, it extended its hand toward Si Ma Tuo.

The thunderous sound echoed. The gray hand descended, covering the sky and earth, as if to crush all existence. Si Ma Tuo felt immense pressure.

“Ferocious God’s Wrath, Trampling the Nine Heavens!” Si Ma Tuo gazed at the hand that could erase everything. His body surged upward, like a golden warrior, taking one step forward.

Chapter 1392: I Am Luo Tian

“Ferocious God’s Wrath, Trampling the Nine Heavens!” Si Ma Tuo’s deep voice echoed. His body surged upward, and with a single step, he met the gray hand.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound shook the sky. The first layer of the ancient celestial palace trembled under their collision.

“Boom…” Si Ma Tuo fell to the ground, his gaze dark. He soared again for the second step.

“Powerful technique! If you were in the Mid-Epoch, I might not have a chance. But you’re still in the Early Epoch!” The gray figure’s voice echoed, and Zhu Jie raised his hand again toward Si Ma Tuo.

“Boom…” The second step collided with the gray hand. Compared to the first, Si Ma Tuo’s condition improved.

“Third step… fourth step…” Si Ma Tuo’s eyes burned with battle spirit, like an indestructible warrior. The fourth and fifth steps of the Ferocious God’s Trample were powerful enough to harm even a Mid-Epoch master. Zhu Jie, an elite prodigy, had to be cautious.

The Ferocious God’s figure slowly formed behind Si Ma Tuo. Two massive feet struck toward Zhu Jie.

“Chaos Dispel!” Seeing the two mighty feet, Zhu Jie finally changed expression. He roared, and the gray figure stood up, striking toward Si Ma Tuo.

Two towering figures clashed—Zhu Jie’s domain master techniques against the Ferocious God’s might. It was as if two titans fought in a different form.

“Boom… boom…” Two thunderous sounds echoed. The two massive figures collapsed, and a fierce explosion resounded in the ancient celestial palace. It shook the crowd’s blood and energy, and the gray mist obscured their vision. The once vast arena exploded, vanishing from sight.

“This Si Ma Tuo’s technique—what is it? It’s so powerful!” Sun Miechen’s eyes flashed with gold, sensing the threat Si Ma Tuo posed.

Not only Sun Miechen but also Zhou Wei and Yan Hongtao were shocked. Even Xu Liyi and Zheng Xin showed disbelief.

Since Si Ma Tuo returned from the Origin Domain, he hadn’t fought. They knew he was strong but had prepared for his shock. Yet now, seeing it with their own eyes, they were stunned.

The surging gray mist submerged the first layer of the ancient celestial palace. A moment later, two figures rose from the gray mist, more solid than before—like a domain master and an ancient king reborn.

“Excellent!” Zhu Jie stood within the figure, his eyes gleaming with admiration as he gazed at the Ferocious God’s form.

“Again!” Si Ma Tuo wiped his lips, his eyes showing defiance. He took another step forward.

“Ferocious God’s Trample—Five Steps to Shake the World!” The thunderous sound echoed. Si Ma Tuo’s fifth step struck, sending a golden foot crashing toward Zhu Jie.

The golden foot collapsed the heavens. Zhu Jie’s face changed instantly. He stood within the gray figure, his hands forming a seal.

The gray figure slowly extended its arms. A moment later, a gray sword of opening the heavens formed on it, emitting a humming sound as it struck Si Ma Tuo’s fifth step.

The ultimate explosion echoed in the ancient celestial palace. The space, just calmed, trembled again. This time, no figures formed—Si Ma Tuo and Zhu Jie lay battered on the ground.

The first layer of the ancient celestial palace fell silent. Everyone gazed at the two lying on the ground, their eyes filled with awe.

“Si Ma Tuo has fought Zhu Jie to this extent!” Yan Hongtao exclaimed, staring at the fallen Si Ma Tuo, his eyes full of shock.

“If this battle spreads, Si Ma Tuo will surely gain fame!” Everyone’s hearts were stunned.

Zhu Jie, a prodigy of the domain master level, had never lost. Yet now he was pushed to this extent.

“What technique is this Si Ma Tuo using? It’s so strong!” Yan Hongtao’s face showed confusion as he gazed at the fallen Si Ma Tuo.

“It’s the Ferocious God’s Five Steps of Trampling!” Zhu Jie slowly rose, his eyes filled with killing intent as he gazed at Si Ma Tuo.

“What connection do you have with the Origin Domain’s royal family?” Zhu Jie’s body radiated killing intent, his eyes scrutinizing the wounded Si Ma Tuo.

“None. I just learned a technique,” Si Ma Tuo’s eyes showed weakness, standing there and breathing heavily.

“How could it be? Do you think our information is so outdated? The Ferocious God’s Five Steps of Trampling can only be learned by the royal family. How did you obtain it?” Zhu Jie’s eyes were fierce, shouting.

“How could it be!” Upon hearing Zhu Jie’s words, Yan Hongtao and Sun Miechen’s eyes flashed with light.

They were both domain master-level figures. Naturally, they knew some secrets. They had long known that the ancient royal family might break free from the Origin Domain.

If Si Ma Tuo truly had connections with the Origin Domain’s royal family, he could not be allowed to live.

“Die!” Si Ma Tuo’s eyes flashed with coldness. He didn’t give Si Ma Tuo a chance to explain, raising his hand again toward him.

“This time, he won’t withstand it!” Sun Miechen sighed, watching the battered Si Ma Tuo. He looked as if he could fall at any moment.

The sky-covering hand descended again, this time Zhu Jie used all his strength. His body radiated gray light, which surged into the hand.

“Offensive Art of Chaos—Zhu Jie’s domain master’s chaotic offensive art!” Yan Hongtao and others’ faces finally changed.

“Damn it, Zhu Jie! You’re trying to kill!” Long Jie’s face flashed with coldness. He immediately flew toward Si Ma Tuo.

“Dragon Domain Master, don’t interfere! This Si Ma Tuo’s origin is suspicious. He possesses the Ferocious God’s technique, so he must be connected to them. We can’t afford to let him live here!” Sun Miechen’s body appeared in Long Jie’s path, his eyes smiling.

“Foolish! This is the Four Sacred Star Domains. If you want to kill, ask us first!” Jiang Nanxuan roared, his black and white energy swirling in his eyes. He rushed toward Zhu Jie.

“Jiang Xiong, Sun Miechen and Zhu Jie are right!” A crimson figure blocked Jiang Nanxuan’s path, speaking softly to him.

“Get out of the way!” Long Jie and Jiang Nanxuan both roared, attacking Sun Miechen and Yan Hongtao.

Zhou Wei stood there, his eyes amused as he gazed at the wobbling Si Ma Tuo. He didn’t act.

“I am Luo Tian!” Si Ma Tuo decided to stop the entanglement. He removed his Thousand Mirage Mask, his eyes cold as he gazed at Zhu Jie.

At the moment the mask was removed, the first layer of the ancient celestial palace seemed to fall silent. Sun Miechen and Yan Hongtao’s faces showed shock, breaking free from their fight with Long Jie and Jiang Nanxuan.

“How could it be!” They opened their mouths, staring at the cold-eyed Luo Tian. This expression hadn’t appeared in years.

“My father saw Luo Tian sacrifice his flesh and soul. How could he have returned from the dead!” Sun Miechen’s eyes showed disbelief, exclaiming.

Yan Hongtao hadn’t expected to see Luo Tian this way. He felt like he’d seen a ghost. He couldn’t fathom how someone who had died so thoroughly could have returned.

Though they had previously doubted Si Ma Tuo, it was only a slight doubt. They quickly dismissed the thought because it seemed too absurd.

“Luo Tian?” Zhu Jie’s face slightly changed, but soon his expression turned mocking. He didn’t withdraw his attack but continued to press toward Luo Tian.

“Skillful in transformation—within a short time, you’ve changed faces multiple times. Now you dare to impersonate the hero Luo Tian of the Nine Realms? I think you truly don’t want to live!” Zhu Jie’s face was grotesque, his hands moving. He didn’t stop but made the gray hand even more terrifying, causing Sun Miechen and Yan Hongtao to feel a sense of crisis.

“Don’t give me any path to live!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with killing intent. Zhu Jie had truly angered him. He had repeatedly avoided, but Zhu Jie hadn’t shown gratitude. Even after revealing his true face, Zhu Jie still wanted to kill him.

Luo Tian believed he had done enough. If he continued to endure, he would no longer be himself.

“Wanting to kill me? You’re nothing. I’ve lived so long; you don’t have the qualifications!” Luo Tian laughed coldly.

“You won’t kill me. Today, you’ll stay here!” Luo Tian soared into the air, revealing his true face. His aura changed completely.

“Confident, undefeated! Even against a Mid-Epoch prodigy, he still has this confidence. This is the Luo Tian I know!” Zhou Wei sighed softly, his eyes showing a smile.

Chapter 1393: Still Need to Kill

“Luo Tian!” Jiang Nanxuan and Long Jie’s faces darkened. They didn’t know why Luo Tian chose this moment to reveal his identity.

“Damn it!” The crowd’s eyes turned murderous, watching Zhu Jie’s destruction attack toward Luo Tian.

“Zhu Jie, you must die!” Jiang Nanxuan’s long hair flew as his eyes showed endless coldness. He spoke, and the melody of his zither echoed, with killing intent accompanying it as it swept toward Zhu Jie.

Though the crowd was anxious, they couldn’t act. The gray hand had already descended upon Luo Tian’s head.

“Severing Heaven Seal!” Luo Tian moved his hands, two golden hands emerging from them. They plunged into the void.

“Boom…” The next moment, the golden hands exploded, forming a golden cloud that illuminated the ancient celestial palace.

A humming sound echoed. A golden vortex formed in the sky, as if gathering some strange power. The clouds emitted an eerie atmosphere.

“What is this?” Sun Miechen and Zhou Wei’s faces changed instantly, their hearts trembling.

The golden vortex was beautiful, slowly rotating in the sky of the ancient celestial palace. It seemed to be absorbing some powerful force, making the clouds emit a terrifying aura.

“Not enough!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed coldness. His three reincarnation immortal bodies activated, and one of them exploded, releasing a surge of epoch power. It flew into the golden vortex in the sky.

“Severing Heaven Seal?” Sun Miechen’s mind was puzzled. He whispered, then widened his eyes in shock, gazing at the golden vortex.

“This is severing heaven’s power!” Zhou Wei spoke loudly, his eyes flashing with light.

“Severing Heaven Master’s technique—last of the three techniques, Severing Heaven Seal! He has mastered it?” Everyone showed shock, gazing at Luo Tian who was activating the golden vortex.

The Severing Heaven Master was the second epoch master of the Nine Realms. His strength needed no explanation. He sealed the ancient royal family, divided the Nine Realms and Origin Domain. For humanity, he was a great hero. If it came to merits, no one could match him except for the Breaker Heaven Master who led humanity’s rise.

This epoch master, whose strength could subdue an entire epoch, ranked among the top three of all epoch masters. His techniques were undoubtedly supernatural.

“Hum…” The golden vortex seemed slow, but it was only a moment. Especially with the addition of one reincarnation immortal body’s epoch power, its speed increased rapidly.

In an instant, a golden seal descended upon the heavens. Even the ancient celestial palace echoed with thunderous sounds, reflecting beams of light into the seal.

“Subdue!” Luo Tian’s face was pale. He pressed his hands downward, and the golden seal plummeted toward Zhu Jie.

“Ugh…” Waves rose around the golden seal, collapsing vast space. It instantly descended upon Zhu Jie’s head.

“Damn it! He chose not to neutralize my attack!” Seeing the golden Severing Heaven Seal, Zhu Jie’s face turned dark.

“Crazy! That seal could have neutralized Zhu Jie’s attack. Why do this? He is still in the Early Epoch!” Yan Hongtao shouted, his eyes filled with confusion.

Others were also stunned by Luo Tian’s decision. This was clearly a mutual destruction plan. Yet, Luo Tian was still in the Early Epoch while Zhu Jie was in the Mid-Epoch. Who would survive was obvious.

However, the crowd’s faces were tense but confident in Luo Tian.

“Then let’s see who dies!” Zhu Jie, clearly self-assured, showed a touch of madness. His hands moved constantly, and gray seals flew from his hands, forming an unbreakable barrier before him.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s side was direct. He destroyed another reincarnation immortal body, and the surging epoch power enveloped him.

Luo Tian had just raised a shield when the gray hand collided with it. On the other side, the golden seal also struck Zhu Jie’s barrier.

“Crack…” Two clear sounds rose. Then, both Luo Tian and Zhu Jie were struck by each other’s techniques.

“Block it!” Luo Tian’s eyes turned blood-red. He raised his hands to block the gray hand, and Zhu Jie did the same, choosing to withstand the Severing Heaven Seal.

But in the next moment, both were crushed by the two mountain-like techniques and fell to the ground.

Thunderous sounds echoed. A gray and golden storm swept out, engulfing people’s vision. Even spiritual senses couldn’t see their condition.

The storm lasted a quarter of an hour before stopping. The crowd turned their eyes toward the two’s direction.

A heart-wrenching trail of blood spread across the crowd's vision, causing them to gasp in shock.

The blood radiated powerful divine essence. Gray mist swirled within it, leaving people in awe.

“Brother…” Zhu Ge Huangchao’s face changed instantly. His gaze fell on the blood trail, his eyes filled with madness.

On the other side, Luo Tian was covered in cracks. Blood coated his entire body, and he lay there with a smile. Yet beneath the blood-stained face, his white teeth glowed, making people shiver.

“He truly is Luo Tian!” Sun Miechen and Yan Hongtao furrowed their brows, watching the fallen Luo Tian with a smile. Now they were certain—this person was Luo Tian. They couldn’t fathom who could face a Mid-Epoch like Zhu Jie in the Early Epoch and make him bleed.

A green glow spread from Luo Tian’s body. At this moment, he felt exhausted and weak but felt a surge of satisfaction from the blood trail.

“I said you must stay,” Luo Tian smiled, raising his hand. Seven-colored flames flew from it, instantly rushing toward the blood trail on the ground.

“Get out of the way!” Zhu Ge Huangchao’s face turned mad. He felt the terror of the seven-colored flames and shouted, his voice cold as he threw a punch.

But in an instant, the seven-colored flames ignited on Zhu Ge Huangchao’s fist. They burned fiercely and spread along his entire arm.

“Boom…” The bell echoed, a thread of chaos light rising behind Zhu Ge Huangchao. A gray ancient bell materialized in the air, radiating supreme power and sending beams of light to envelop Zhu Ge Huangchao.

“Reborn?” The crowd’s faces showed shock, watching the figure rising behind Zhu Ge Huangchao. They hadn’t expected Zhu Jie to recover so quickly.

“Because of the Chaos Holy Body?” Luo Tian, supported by Zheng Xin and others, stood up but remained weak. His gaze fell on Zhu Jie.

“Who are you?” Zhu Jie’s face was pale. He gazed at Luo Tian, his eyes filled with deep concern.

“Luo Tian!” Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Zhu Jie. His eyes showed a smile, as if he had guessed Zhu Jie’s thoughts.

They stared at each other for tens of breaths. Finally, Zhu Jie’s face showed a smile: “I was careless before. Please don’t take it personally, Luo Xiong. I thought you were dead!”

“Disgraceful!” Zheng Xin and others saw Zhu Jie’s expression, as if nothing had happened. This was clearly not admitting their previous intent to kill Luo Tian. They couldn’t help but mutter.

Luo Tian’s eyes showed depth, then he sighed: “Ignorance is no fault.”

“Ah…” As the atmosphere became delicate, a scream echoed from behind Zhu Jie. People turned their eyes to Zhu Ge Huangchao.

“My arm… it can’t be restored!” Zhu Ge Huangchao’s eyes showed horror, watching the seven-colored flames burning his arm.

“Luo Tian! What did you do to me? Take this cursed flame away!” Zhu Jie shouted, his voice filled with fear.

“Oh, sorry. I was just defending myself. I couldn’t control this flame either!” Luo Tian swallowed a pill, his body slowly recovering. His pale face showed a smile as he gazed at Zhu Jie.

“Blackmail, extortion!” People saw Luo Tian’s attitude and knew he was clearly demanding a price from Zhu Jie.
