“This token contains the strike of an Immortal King, but over these years I’ve consumed much of it. Now its power is equivalent to a Late True Immortal’s strike. Still, it should be enough for you, Senior Brother Luo, to save your life!”

“You can divide it into five strikes of a Mid-True Immortal or ten strikes of an Early True Immortal. How you use it is entirely up to you,” Jiang Yuzhe said softly.

“Such a precious item!” Luo Tian’s eyes lit up upon hearing Jiang Yuzhe’s words. He hadn’t expected Jiang Yuzhe to be so generous. For anyone in the Lower or Middle Heavens, this would be a talisman of protection. A Late True Immortal’s strike—how many in the Lower Heavens could withstand it? Even among the Middle Heavens, few would survive.

“Thank you, thank you! Senior Brother Jiang, rest assured I’ll return!” Luo Tian shouted, exchanging a few more words with Jiang Yuzhe before leaving the courtyard alongside Xuan Dan.

“Damn brat, what’s wrong with Jiang Yuzhe? Did he get bitten by a ghost?”

“Also, are you truly only fifty percent certain?” As Luo Tian and Xuan Dan walked along the street, Xuan Dan’s face bore a smile as he asked, sensing Luo Tian was hiding something.

“I suspect his body has issues. He was likely injured by a powerful ghost in infancy. Ghost attacks are often invisible, hard for ordinary people to detect. Over time, the damage manifested.”

“His backing faction is formidable—there must be a great sage suppressing his life force. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have survived this long.” Luo Tian spoke softly, sensing the terrifying ghostly energy restrained within Jiang Yuzhe’s body through his Ghost Sealing Mark.

“As for the percentage of success, I’ll admit I have a hundred percent chance to heal him,” Luo Tian said confidently.

“…”

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Xuan Dan was speechless. He could guess Luo Tian’s intent—most people would leave a path of retreat, but Luo Tian claimed only fifty percent when he had a hundred. The retreat was too generous.

“Why not just heal him directly?” Cen Weihong, unaware of the situation, looked at Luo Tian with a bewildered expression.

“Idiot! If I said a hundred percent, he’d be healed instantly. How would that highlight my importance? My value? And how would I collect the gifts he prepared? Jiang Yuzhe isn’t simple. Don’t be fooled by his frail appearance, but his faction is terrifying. Let him owe us a greater debt—perhaps it’ll be useful later! This token is the best proof!” Luo Tian explained to Cen Weihong.

Though Cen Weihong was strong, his experience paled in comparison to Luo Tian’s. Luo Tian felt he needed to teach this idiot a lesson, after all, he was his junior disciple.

After hearing Luo Tian’s explanation, Cen Weihong’s face shifted slightly before understanding his intent, admiration flashing across his face.

“Alright, let’s go. Prepare to head to the Middle Heavens!” Xuan Dan nodded with satisfaction. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to plan so deeply, unwittingly setting a trap for Jiang Yuzhe.

“Senior Brother, I haven’t attended the auction yet. Could we go tomorrow? I need some time!” Luo Tian said to Xuan Dan, his tone subtly meaningful. He knew Xuan Dan would understand.

“Hmm, a day or two later won’t matter,” Xuan Dan nodded. He understood what Luo Tian was up to and would assist when necessary. At this point, he saw himself, Luo Tian, and Cen Weihong as a single unit.

Not long after, Luo Tian and the others returned to the courtyard. As soon as they entered, Luo Tian felt something strange. He removed his Thousand Mirage Mask, knowing Jiang Yuzhe wouldn’t deceive him—escaping the wanted list was just a matter of time.

“Let’s go!” Xuan Dan’s face darkened as well, sensing the courtyard’s peculiar nature.

“Master Xuan has returned!” As they stepped into the courtyard, Tian Hongyun greeted them with a smile and respect.

“Hmph, returned. They’ve found him too. Let’s go inside,” Xuan Dan said softly, watching Zhang Jinghuan and the others emerge upon hearing his voice.

“There’s nothing to say. Master Xuan, let’s just seize this brat and send him to the Mirage Island. It’ll gain favor with the Mirage Island and avoid being implicated!” Zhang Jinghuan’s face was cold, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

The others also bore hostility toward Luo Tian, clearly upset by the trouble he had caused.

“Apologies, but I’ve handled everything. After attending the auction tomorrow, we can leave the Mirage Island,” Luo Tian bowed to them, though their relationship was poor, he still needed to speak politely.

“Haha! Luo Tian, do you think you’re someone? A toad sticking out its tongue—how bold! Does the Mirage Island owe you respect?” Zhang Jinghuan laughed upon hearing Luo Tian’s words.

“Senior Brother Luo, the mistake has already been made. Don’t be stubborn. For our safety, you should turn yourself in to the Mirage Island. Perhaps the Mirage Island will show mercy if your attitude is good,” Tian Hongyun said mockingly, no longer regarding Luo Tian with any fear. He knew Luo Tian was about to die.

“Tian Hongyun, what are you? A lowly little rat! How dare you speak to me like that?” Luo Tian sneered, taking a step forward toward Tian Hongyun. An invisible aura radiated from his body.

“Luo Tian, what are you doing?” As Luo Tian took a step forward, an old man emerged from the shadows, standing beside Tian Hongyun with cautious eyes.

“Oh? Master Xiao, what are you planning?” Luo Tian’s gaze held coldness. This Master Xiao was named Xiao Jiaping, who had said little throughout the journey but now stood up.

“Nothing, just my disciple isn’t yours to scold!” Xiao Jiaping’s face was cold as he replied.

“Disciple? I see, that’s why you’re so arrogant—finally found a patron!” Luo Tian sneered.

“Luo Tian, don’t push it too far. We’ve already decided to expel you from the Heaven-Door Sect. From today on, you are no longer a disciple of the Heaven-Door Sect!” Zhang Jinghuan said with a smile, but his eyes were filled with hostility.

“Oh? Expelling the Heaven-Door Sect? I didn’t know about this,” Xuan Dan’s gaze darkened, turning to Zhang Jinghuan and the others.

“Master Xuan, this brat can’t be spared. Otherwise, he’ll eventually kill us all!” Zhang Jinghuan replied to Xuan Dan, though Xuan Dan was respected, he too was a Grand Elder.

“Is this how you treat disciples? I’ve seen the truth myself. I can testify for him! Expelling an inner sect disciple without reason—old man, I disagree!” Xuan Dan sneered, his gaze toward Zhang Jinghuan and the others now cold.

A chilling atmosphere filled the courtyard, as if the world itself had changed seasons with Xuan Dan’s mood. The wind was bone-chilling.

“Haha, resolved? How do I not know?” As Xuan Dan’s words finished, a mocking voice echoed in their ears. At the same time, radiant light surged around the courtyard, instantly enveloping Luo Tian, Xuan Dan, and Cen Weihong.

“Buzz…” Golden seals formed chains, flying toward Luo Tian.

“You who are you?” Xuan Dan sneered, slapping his hand forward. A green giant hand clashed with the golden chains.

“Crack…” The golden chains shattered instantly, and the figures were pushed back by an invisible wave.

“Do you dare interfere with Mirage Island affairs?” The leader, a middle-aged man, said coldly, gazing at Xuan Dan.

“Wait a moment; you’ll understand soon,” Xuan Dan said calmly, knowing the order hadn’t reached them yet.

“Ah, a traitor has emerged!” Luo Tian sneered, gazing at Zhang Jinghuan and Tian Hongyun. These Mirage Island people knew he was here—someone had definitely informed them.

“Luo Tian, surrender yourself; don’t cause us trouble!” Tian Hongyun sneered, addressing Luo Tian. From today on, the Heaven-Door Sect’s prodigy was only Cen Weihong above him.

Chapter 1892: The Mirage Island Lord ()

“Long have I suspected your rebellious nature. I didn’t expect you to expose yourself so quickly!” Luo Tian smiled, ignoring the Mirage Island people and gazing at Tian Hongyun and Xiao Jiaping.

“Apologies, but moving upward is natural. Joining the Mirage Island was a chance to move upward for me. If I join the Mirage Island, it benefits both me and the Heaven-Door Sect!” Tian Hongyun said indifferently, speaking to Luo Tian. Now he had no restraint; he knew Luo Tian was doomed.

“Haha, little rat! You still have a long way to go before you can kill me!” Luo Tian laughed, his voice filled with contempt.

“Attack! Anyone who obstructs us will be punished for provoking the Mirage Island!” Seeing Luo Tian’s arrogance, the Mirage Island people could no longer tolerate it. The leader, a middle-aged man at the peak of Heaven-Immortal, spoke coldly, gazing at Xuan Dan.

“Buzz…” As the leader’s words ended, waves of energy surged again from the Mirage Island group. A dozen people rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Who dares!” Xuan Dan sneered, his aura towering as he stood before Luo Tian.

“Get out of the way!” Though facing Xuan Dan, the Mirage Island people showed no fear. A Heaven-Immortal peak and a dozen Heaven-Immortal late-stage disciples—confident they could restrain Xuan Dan.

Golden light flickered, and auras of immortals emerged from the dozen people, gradually converging into a massive golden net that descended upon Luo Tian.

But they had underestimated Xuan Dan’s strength. Standing beside Luo Tian, Xuan Dan looked coldly at the net.

“Want to capture him? First, you must go through me!” Xuan Dan’s eyes flashed with coldness. True Immortal power surged, his body rising into the air. Two golden hands grasped the net and tore it apart with a single pull.

“Burst…” The golden net was instantly torn, and the shockwave struck their bodies.

“You dare to attack us? True Immortals are strong, but the Mirage Island has killed True Immortals before!” The middle-aged man said, then took out a jade pendant from his hand and imprinted an incantation onto it.

“Wait, I’ve already contacted my Mirage Sect’s True Immortal strength. When they arrive, I’ll deal with you too!” The middle-aged man shouted, his voice filled with arrogance.

“Then I’ll deal with you before they arrive. It’s been years since I’ve fought—let me stretch my limbs!” Xuan Dan sneered, then his old body vanished from the spot. In an instant, he appeared before the Heaven-Immortal peak middle-aged man.

“Boom…” A red hand struck the middle-aged man’s chest, and the Heaven-Immortal peak disciple was as helpless as a child before Xuan Dan. The middle-aged man was sent flying, coughing blood and falling to the ground like a broken kite.

“Buzz…” After defeating the Heaven-Immortal peak disciple, Xuan Dan’s feet moved with wind-like speed. Like a tiger entering a flock of sheep, he rushed toward the remaining Heaven-Immortal late-stage Mirage Island disciples.

A chorus of screams echoed as each powerful Heaven-Immortal late-stage disciple fell to Xuan Dan’s hands, unable to withstand even a breath. In an instant, the dozen people lay battered and groaning on the ground.

“You’re done! You’ve insulted us for years, and now you’ve dared to attack!” The Heaven-Immortal peak middle-aged man shouted, his voice filled with ferocity.

“Master Xuan, have you gone mad!” Zhang Jinghuan and Du Chengshi saw Xuan Dan had taken action, their faces changing. Xuan Dan was too important to the Heaven-Door Sect; especially since he was a True Immortal.

“As a Grand Elder, when a disciple is harmed, you not only fail to protect but also plan to expel him from the sect? You don’t deserve to associate with me, Xuan Dan!” Xuan Dan’s face was filled with mockery.

“You…” Hearing Xuan Dan’s unhidden mockery, Zhang Jinghuan’s face darkened. Du Chengshi’s expression also shifted slightly.

“Do you think I want to be captured by the Mirage Island and join them?” Luo Tian’s face was cold as he took a step toward Tian Hongyun. Behind him, Cen Weihong’s face was icy, spreading coldness around them.

“What are you doing? I’m about to become a Mirage Island disciple. If you attack me, the Mirage Island won’t let you off!” Tian Hongyun saw Luo Tian and Cen Weihong approaching, his face darkening. Not out of fear for Luo Tian, but for Cen Weihong.

“You deserve death!” Luo Tian’s face was deep with anger. This Tian Hongyun was a complete scoundrel. If he hadn’t met Fang Zhengyang, he might have fallen to Tian Hongyun’s trap.

“Little brat, dare to touch my disciple? Ask me if I’ll allow it!” Xiao Jiaping roared, stepping forward to block Tian Hongyun.

“If you want to die, then I’ll take you down too!” Luo Tian sneered. A Heaven-Immortal late-stage disciple—Luo Tian no longer regarded them as a threat. Even if Zhang Jinghuan and Du Chengshi had angered him, he would use the Token of Heaven to kill them on the spot. Though it might cause some trouble, he didn’t care.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian’s feet generated waves of energy, then his body surged forward like a primordial beast, directly colliding with Tian Hongyun.

“Little brat, you dare to attack us Mirage Island disciples!” Xiao Jiaping sneered, stepping in front of Tian Hongyun to block Luo Tian’s path.

“You really think highly of yourself. You haven’t even entered the Mirage Island yet, and you’ve already considered yourself one of them!” Cen Weihong looked at Xiao Jiaping and Tian Hongyun, feeling a sense of revulsion.

“This brat must have gone mad… Did Master Xuan go mad too?” Ke Zhenghao and Duan Chengfeng watched Luo Tian rushing toward Xiao Jiaping.

“How could he go mad…” Duan Chengfeng shook his head, gazing at Luo Tian. He had already experienced Luo Tian’s terrifying power.

“Crack…” As people were stunned, a breaking sound echoed in their ears. Luo Tian’s golden body collided with Xiao Jiaping.

“Ah…” A scream echoed from Xiao Jiaping, his chest collapsing instantly. Blood spewed from his mouth as he was sent flying backward, colliding with Tian Hongyun and falling several feet before stopping. Both lay on the ground in disbelief.

Ke Zhenghao, Tian Hongyun, and Xiao Jiaping had never seen Luo Tian’s power before. Ke Zhenghao was immediately stunned by Luo Tian’s strength.

“If you all want me dead, I’ll kill you first!” Luo Tian sneered, his spear “Rip the Heavens” in hand. He took a step toward Tian Hongyun and Xiao Jiaping.

“Grand Elder, save me! I’m about to enter the Mirage Island. I’ll never forget your great kindness!” Tian Hongyun, seeing Luo Tian approach, stammered. He had been stunned by Luo Tian’s previous move.

“You little rat! Do you dare to deceive me? I’ve lived this long, and it’s not easy for you to deceive me!” Luo Tian sneered, lifting his spear “Rip the Heavens” and thrusting it toward Tian Hongyun.

“Stop!” At the moment Luo Tian attacked, Zhang Jinghuan shouted, his overwhelming pressure sweeping toward Luo Tian. At the same time, he took a step forward and grabbed the spear’s shaft.

“Buzz…” The spear that was about to pierce forward suddenly bent, its body humming with waves.

“What are you doing?” Luo Tian spoke coldly, his gaze locked onto Zhang Jinghuan.

“He cannot die. He is about to enter the Mirage Island. Having this line with the Mirage Island benefits our fight for the Heavens!” Zhang Jinghuan spoke softly, offering an excuse that wasn’t one.

“Haha, enter the Mirage Island by betraying me?!”

“I’ll wait for the Mirage Island’s people to come. Let’s see if your so-called Mirage Island will kill me!”

“But I hope you don’t regret it. Later, we’ll kill you for betraying the sect and turning against it!” Luo Tian sneered. He calculated the time, guessing that Jiang Yuzhe had already spread the news. He wanted Tian Hongyun to die in humiliation and despair.

“Indeed, little brat! Have the courage to wait for us Mirage Island people!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the leader of the Mirage Island at Heaven-Immortal peak also shouted.

Luo Tian walked back to Xuan Dan’s side, his gaze mocking the people lying on the ground.

“You’re doomed. My Mirage Island’s True Immortal masters are coming soon. You’ll all be caught!” The Heaven-Immortal peak leader said mockingly, his voice filled with contempt. His face was bloodied from Xuan Dan’s palm.

q11

Time slowly passed, and the people lying on the ground gradually stood up, their eyes filled with resentment toward Luo Tian and Xuan Dan. Zhang Jinghuan and the others had contemplative expressions; they knew Xuan Dan, who was always enigmatic in the Heaven-Door Sect. If they couldn’t sense Xuan Dan’s close relationship with Luo Tian, then they were truly wasted.

“Buzz…” Soon after, waves of energy echoed in the sky. Several figures strode through the heavens, their overwhelming pressure instantly descending upon everyone, causing people’s faces to shift slightly.

“Master Jiang!” The Mirage Island guards cheered, gazing at the first man—a tall middle-aged man with thick eyebrows and sharp eyes. He stood in the sky, exuding a heavy pressure. His eyes flashed with piercing light.

They hadn’t expected their message to summon the Mirage Island’s leader himself.

“Late True Immortal!” Xuan Dan frowned, his gaze serious as he stood before the middle-aged man.

Jiang Huantian, a Late True Immortal, was among the top figures in the Middle Heavens. He represented the Heaven-Heaven Sect and governed the Lower Heavens’ Mirage Island.

Behind Jiang Huantian stood several figures, their auras also radiating True Immortal power. Two Mid-True Immortals and four Late True Immortals—this was a terrifying force, capable of sweeping through the Lower Heavens including the three major sects.

Chapter 1894: The Auction ()

Luo Tian watched Xuan Dan and Jiang Huantian leave, a smile on his face. He knew Xuan Dan would use his six-star Immortal Alchemist status to build relationships with them, fully leveraging the advantages of an alchemist.

ql

“Rest well. Attend the auction tomorrow and then head to the Middle Heavens!” Luo Tian said to Cen Weihong, entering his room.

Zhang Jinghuan and Du Chengshi’s faces were grim as they turned into their rooms.

Ke Zhenghao and Duan Chengfeng wore expressions of regret. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so influential in Mirage City.

One night passed without a word. The next day, the entire Mirage City discussed the sudden withdrawal of the wanted notice. Who could have caused trouble in Mirage City and then left it unresolved? This was almost unheard of, leaving people curious about who Luo Tian truly was.

“Tian-Door Sect’s prodigy!” People soon learned Luo Tian’s identity, surprised to find he was a disciple of the Tian-Door Sect.

“According to logic, the Tian-Door Sect wouldn’t have such a big favor. Even Master Xuan might not have this much influence. What is this Luo Tian’s background?” People only discussed for a while before being drawn to another news.

The Mirage Auction was canceled due to the incident yesterday, but today it reopened.

Instantly, the Mirage Island became lively again, people rushing toward the auction hall to witness it.

Luo Tian and Cen Weihong stepped out of the courtyard, seeing Xuan Dan who hadn’t returned overnight. Xuan Dan’s face bore a smile as he watched Luo Tian and Cen Weihong walk out.

“Son, is one day enough? If not, I can use the excuse of helping them refine elixirs to delay a few days!” Xuan Dan spoke softly.

“Enough!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly. In truth, he already considered Zhang Jinghuan dead. No matter how South Palace Yuqing prepared, Luo Tian now had enough confidence to kill Zhang Jinghuan.

However, if he killed Zhang Jinghuan in Mirage City, it would surely draw the Tian-Door Sect’s investigation. It was troublesome. With Tian Hongyun and Xiao Jiaping already dead, Zhang Jinghuan’s identity in the Tian-Door Sect was extremely sensitive. If he truly died, it would surely cause a stir in the Tian-Door Sect.

“Hmph, good!” Xuan Dan nodded. He felt that in terms of scheming, he wasn’t a match for Luo Tian.

“Then we’ll go first. Senior Brother, prepare yourself!” Luo Tian smiled, leading Cen Weihong toward the auction hall.

Not long after, Luo Tian and Cen Weihong arrived at the auction hall’s entrance. They saw the massive auction venue and the crowd surrounding it, Luo Tian’s lips twitching slightly.

“Make way! We need to enter the hall!” Luo Tian shouted, pushing people aside repeatedly. There was no other way in without doing so.

“Such a young one with an invitation?” People were surprised to see Luo Tian and Cen Weihong.

“Isn’t this the person who was wanted yesterday?” Soon after, someone recognized Luo Tian and gasped. They hadn’t expected to see the legendary figure so easily.

“Luo Tian!” People’s recognition immediately cleared a path for Luo Tian, after all, this was someone who didn’t offend the Mirage Island.

“Thank you!” Luo Tian naturally didn’t hesitate, holding his invitation and walking through the crowd. Under people’s stares like monsters, he felt a bit awkward as he stepped inside.

“What the hell is this?” Luo Tian was uncomfortable, surrounded by people on both sides who stared at him unblinkingly. Anyone would feel uneasy.

“Make way! Make way!” As Luo Tian had taken a few steps, three figures rushed in from outside the crowd. They ran swiftly and were soon behind Luo Tian.

“Get out of my way, country bumpkin!” A young man in white robes shouted, his two elders behind him.

“Damn it, who dares bother this master!” People looked at the young man with a foolish expression. However, upon seeing the two elders behind him, their brows slightly twitched.

The two elders wore blue robes, and their auras were True Immortal Early-stage. They stood behind the young man like attendants, making it clear that the young man’s identity was no ordinary.

“What did you say?” Luo Tian’s face turned cold, surprised that someone in Mirage City would bother him.

“You!” Luo Tian glared at the young man, who had dared to block his path.

“Why are you still here? I can’t wait for you to move aside! Although we can’t fight within the Mirage Island, once you leave it, I have a hundred methods to kill you! If you want to try, I’ll play with you!” The young man’s face was cold, surprised that Luo Tian still stood there.

“Smack!” Without hesitation, Luo Tian slapped him. The speed was so fast that even the two True Immortal Early-stage elders didn’t react in time. It wasn’t that they couldn’t react, but no one expected someone to attack within the Mirage Island.

The clear slap sound drew people’s attention, and the crowd murmured with excitement, watching the spectacle.

“Who is this guy? The son of an Immortal King? He just beat the Mirage Island guards yesterday and now he’s so boldly slapped someone!” People looked at Luo Tian, admiration in their eyes. This was truly a troublemaker who repeatedly challenged the Mirage Island’s rules.

“You dare to hit me? Do you think I can’t kill you and your entire faction? I like to fight people who think they have some ability!” The young man’s face was cold, slowly standing up from the crowd.

“Both of you, kill him! If there’s anything, I’ll cover for you!” The young man pointed at Luo Tian and shouted.

“Yeh Chengchen! So this is Yeh Chengchen! How did he end up here!” Upon hearing the young man’s name, people gasped.

“The number one纨绔 in the Middle Heavens! The son of the Star River Prefecture’s Prefect!” People whispered, their gazes turning to Yeh Chengchen.

“Hearing this Yeh Chengchen, he values face and show-off. Anyone who doesn’t give him face will fight with them. Although Yeh Chengchen’s strength isn’t great, his father Yeh Wu Dao is the Prefect of Star River Prefecture. His uncle Yeh Tian is also a Deputy Prefect of Star River Prefecture. Other uncles and elders are all strong individuals—this family is full of ruthless people! Yeh Chengchen was spoiled from birth!” People whispered, describing Yeh Chengchen’s background.

“Star River Prefecture!” Upon hearing the people’s whispers, Luo Tian wore a look of anticipation. On one side was a man who dared to attack the Mirage Island, and on the other was the number one纨绔 of the Middle Heavens. Who would be more ruthless?

“…”

Luo Tian heard the people’s introduction, his eye twitching. He hadn’t expected to run into someone from Star River Prefecture.

As people whispered, the two True Immortal Early-stage disciples approached Luo Tian but didn’t attack. They knew what attacking meant, and although Star River Prefecture was strong, they didn’t want to offend the Mirage Island.

Yeh Chengchen was a纨绔; these two weren’t. They understood the Mirage Island’s background and, upon hearing people’s whispers, realized this young man wasn’t someone ordinary. If they provoked the wrong person, Yeh Chengchen might not have problems, but they wouldn’t be so lucky.

“What’s going on?” The two elders were unsure how to proceed when a voice echoed in their ears. An old man stepped forward, and people naturally made way for him.

“Son, what trouble have you gotten into again?” The old man looked at Luo Tian with a slight surprise and smiled, standing beside him to let Luo Tian breathe a sigh of relief.

“Master Liu!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully, having learned the old man’s name, Liu Yueming, from yesterday.

“Master Liu!” Yeh Chengchen shouted, seeing Liu Yueming had recognized Luo Tian and thought he was under Liu Yueming’s command.

“Ah, it’s Yeh Senior! What wind brought you here? Is your father well?” Liu Yueming smiled, indicating Luo Tian was safe.

“My father is fine, but my son isn’t so good. He arrived at the Mirage Island and was bullied, even getting slapped!” Yeh Chengchen sneered.

“Haha, Senior Yeh, I can’t control this one. He’s a friend of our master, so I can’t interfere!” Liu Yueming smiled and brought up Jiang Yuzhe.

“What?” Upon hearing Liu Yueming mention Jiang Yuzhe, Yeh Chengchen instinctively trembled.

“He’s actually a friend of the master?” Yeh Chenghen forgot his pain, circling Luo Tian and scrutinizing him.

“If he’s a friend of the master, then he’s my friend. I’ll give the master a favor!” Yeh Chengchen nodded after observing for a while.

“Haha, Senior Yeh, I was too harsh earlier. I didn’t know it was you! Mistake, mistake! Please accept this gift!” Luo Tian saw Yeh Chengchen’s willingness to reconcile and felt he had a good impression. After all, he was the son of Star River Prefecture’s Prefect.

“Haha, Senior Brother, I like your personality! This is too embarrassing!” Yeh Chengchen took out his storage bag and smiled.

“Senior Brother, don’t lie to me. I’m short on money! My father and those uncles are stingy, giving me only five million spirit stones a month as allowance. I ran out after playing in the stone gambling hall for a few days!” Yeh Chengchen forgot his previous anger and spoke to Luo Tian.

“Senior Brother, you also gamble? You’ve found the right person! Back then…” Luo Tian smiled and quickly became buddy-buddy with Yeh Chengchen, walking into the auction hall. People around them were stunned.

Chapter 1895: The纨绔 ()

“Did they really reconcile? They were about to fight each other before, but now they’re friends. This change is too fast!” People were speechless as the two entered the auction hall, their disappointment evident. They had hoped for a good show but instead saw them become brothers instantly.

“Two bastards, go away! Disperse!” Liu Yueming’s beard twitched as he watched the two walk toward the auction hall entrance. He felt a bad premonition; Luo Tian didn’t need to be mentioned, but these two had caused the Mirage Island’s prestige to suffer.

Yeh Chengchen, the number one纨绔, wasn’t someone who would easily back down. The two together might cause trouble.

“Both of you, watch over your young master. If anything happens at the auction, don’t blame us for not giving Star River Prefecture a favor!” Liu Yueming spoke to Yeh Chengchen’s two attendants.

“Yes, yes… don’t worry…” They nodded quickly and followed Luo Tian and Yeh Chengchen.

“Haha, Senior Brother Tian, you really opened the Dragon Eye Crystal?” Yeh Chengchen rubbed his hands, looking at Luo Tian with admiration.

“Of course! Brother, I’ll admit no one believed me back then. There was even a fool who bet against me and mocked me, thinking he could take my things. I shouted and slashed, what do you think happened?”

“Fool! Everyone was a fool. The entire stone gambling hall echoed with people’s drool!” Luo Tian shouted, exaggerating his past experience at the stone gambling hall.

“Senior Brother, you’re my real brother! One day I’ll definitely take you to the stone gambling hall and let you dominate!” Yeh Chengchen looked at Luo Tian with admiration.

“Haha, Senior Brother, I’ll go to Star River Prefecture in the Middle Heavens soon. Senior Brother Yeh, please take care of me! I’ll guarantee to let you dominate!” Luo Tian boasted confidently.

As they spoke, they reached the auction hall entrance and handed their invitations to the guards.

“Senior Brother, let’s go to my place! I’m a golden VIP!” Yeh Chengchen waved his hand, taking out a golden card and handing it to the two guards.

“Good,” Luo Tian nodded. He didn’t know what level his VIP card was, but he knew it was higher than Yeh Chengchen’s. If he showed it, it might embarrass Yeh Chengchen.

“Haha, Senior Yeh, long time no see!” As Yeh Chengchen handed over his VIP card, a voice echoed in their ears.

Among the crowd, an old man and a young one walked into Luo Tian and Yeh Chengchen’s line of sight, causing Luo Tian to frown slightly.

Huang Youshan, the young man who had clashed with Nan Gong Yuqing earlier, hadn’t been seen since. Now he was here and even knew Yeh Chengchen.

“Hmph, I didn’t expect it to be you, a little eel!” Yeh Chengchen sneered, his face showing disdain.

“Senior Brother Yeh knows him?” Luo Tian noticed the hostility in Yeh Chengchen’s eyes and asked.

“Hmph, he’s a disciple of the Wushang Sect in the Middle Heavens. We call him ‘Eel’—a纨绔 disciple, but one without limits. He’s变态, loving to use eels…” Yeh Chengchen whispered, explaining Huang Youshan’s story to Luo Tian. This made Luo Tian shudder and glance at Huang Youshan’s backside.

“Truly变态…” Luo Tian felt a layer of goosebumps, surprised there were such oddities in the world.

“Senior Yeh, even your golden VIP card is so showy!” Huang Youshan looked at Yeh Chengchen’s golden VIP card and spoke sharply, then waved his hand. Purple light emerged from Huang Youshan’s palm.

“Purple card…” As the purple light flickered, people around them gasped, clearly knowing what a purple VIP card represented.

“Senior Yeh, see? Diamond VIP card! It can borrow five million spirit stones!” Huang Youshan waved his card, stepping toward Huang Youshan.

“Truly idle…” Luo Tian was speechless watching Huang Youshan, realizing this man was also a纨绔.

“Your father really舍得 give you money…” Yeh Chengchen gritted his teeth, feeling inferior to Huang Youshan.

“Not my father gave me money; it was someone who sent me a lot of money at the stone gambling hall recently. I spent it to get this!” Huang Youshan, hearing Yeh Chengchen’s words, recalled the origin of his purple card.

“You two bastards, don’t cause trouble! Don’t ruin the Mirage Island’s rules!” Liu Yueming shook his head, looking at Luo Tian.

“Respectable Elder, I’ll abide by the rules!” Luo Tian knew Liu Yueming was reminding him not to go too far. If he acted again, the Mirage Island would be in a difficult position. Luo Tian understood this well; someone protected him, and he wouldn’t dare to overstep.

“Senior Brother Yeh, let’s go to my place!” Luo Tian smiled seeing Yeh Chengchen was upset. He waved his hand, and a dark light flew from his palm. The black card given by Jiang Huantian appeared in Luo Tian’s hand, immediately drawing people’s attention.

“What level of VIP card is this? I’ve never seen one like it!” People whispered, their faces filled with confusion.
