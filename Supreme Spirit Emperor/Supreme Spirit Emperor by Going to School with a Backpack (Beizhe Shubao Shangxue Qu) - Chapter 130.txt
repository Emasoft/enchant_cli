Chapter 636: Victory and Defeat

Jiang Le Rong, like a meteor streaking through the sky, spat blood from her mouth, her face etched with shock as she collided with the barrier. On her white chest lay a massive footprint.

The disciples of the Wenxin Sect erupted in cheers, but before they could process it, their eyes widened in disbelief, staring at Jiang Le Rong colliding with the barrier.

Before they could react, Luo Tian stepped into the Fengtian Step, appearing before Jiang Le Rong like a phantom. With a single punch of the "Mingsheng" technique, he struck her head with devastating force.

Too fast—Luo Tian, now in the state of "Unity of Heaven and Humanity," seemed transformed. His injured body rapidly healed, while the power of Mingsheng reached its peak.

"This..."
"Truly, this boy has entered the Unity of Heaven and Humanity!" The elders of Wenxin Sect wore expressions of shock, even Xu Deshui, who had remained composed, was astonished.

"Hmph," Siti Chen let out a cold snort, his gaze shifting to the elders of Wenxin Sect before bursting into laughter.

Siti Chen's long laugh not only expelled his inner frustration but also left the elders of Wenxin Sect flushed with embarrassment, especially after Jiang Le Rong's earlier mocking remarks were now returned to her by Luo Tian's mastery of Unity.

"Madness! Dao is Dao, truly mad!" Ren Hongzhi and others watched Luo Tian's relentless attacks with exhilaration, laughing heartily.

After entering Unity of Heaven and Humanity, Luo Tian's attack speed and power overwhelmed Jiang Le Rong. What truly unnerved her was the angle of his strikes, all aimed at her blind spots.

The scene replayed like a film—Jiang Le Rong's earlier assault on Luo Tian, but now the roles were reversed. Jiang Le Rong was the one being struck.

Luo Tian kept his eyes closed, delivering punch after punch to Jiang Le Rong's body without mercy. His blows landed with precision, even striking her womanly parts, causing her to recoil in pain and nearly vomit blood.

After thirty breaths, Jiang Le Rong felt her body could no longer endure, as if on the verge of collapse.

"Impossible! If this continues, I will surely lose. Dammit, I never thought this annoying fellow would enter Unity of Heaven and Humanity!" Jiang Le Rong's body slammed against the barrier, her face dark with resolve.

"Blue Lotus Transformation!" Jiang Le Rong retreated, shouting as her aura shifted dramatically. She extended a hand, and the surrounding spiritual energy surged toward her, forming a four-colored lotus beneath her.

An invisible wave rose from Jiang Le Rong's body, her flowing robes fluttering as she stood upon the lotus. Her aura took on an ethereal quality, and though her appearance was ordinary, the disciples of Wenxin Sect were awestruck.

In an instant, the four-colored lotus shrank into a pattern that imprinted itself on Jiang Le Rong's forehead.

As the mark took hold, her aura surged like a breached dam, exploding with overwhelming power.

"Secret Technique!" The disciples of Wenxin Sect gasped as Jiang Le Rong's aura climbed to the peak of Pillar Soul.

"Even if you enter Unity of Heaven and Humanity, what good is it?" Jiang Le Rong sneered, her finger snapping as a four-colored spiritual energy arrow shot toward Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." A piercing hum echoed in the ears of all present, slicing through space before appearing before Luo Tian.

"Ptui..." Blood splattered as even Luo Tian, in Unity of Heaven and Humanity, failed to react in time. The arrow pierced his shoulder.

As Jiang Le Rong reached the peak of Pillar Soul and was struck, Luo Tian opened his eyes. He saw Jiang Le Rong, her long hair dancing in the wind, radiating overwhelming power from a thousand zhang away.

"Has he entered the late stage of Pillar Soul?" Luo Tian's face curled into a smile, indifferent to the wound on his shoulder.

"Die..." Jiang Le Rong's face lit up with joy as she saw Luo Tian awake. She transformed into a streak of light, forming another lotus technique in her hand and striking toward Luo Tian.

"Kai Tian!" A golden "Kai Tian" seal flew from the void, crushing Jiang Le Rong's lotus technique.

The collision of the Kai Tian seal and the green lotus produced a thunderous roar, shaking the barrier.

"Hmph. Even if you enter Unity of Heaven and Humanity again, you are no match for me!" Jiang Le Rong's inner voice sneered as she flew forward, her white fists clenching tightly.

"Secret techniques? Do you think only you have them?" Luo Tian's lips curled slightly, his face turning colder.

"Sixth Soul!" Luo Tian stepped into the Fengtian Step, vanishing from his spot and appearing a thousand zhang away. Upon landing, he activated the "Ranpo Method."

Luo Tian knew that while his current strength was unshakable against the late stage of Pillar Soul, it still fell short against the peak. Each minor level in Pillar Soul was a vast gap.

As he activated Ranpo Method, his body emitted thunderous roars, and his aura climbed to the late stage of Pillar Soul.

"Pillar Soul Late Stage? Not enough! Sixth Soul!" Luo Tian clenched his fists, feeling the strength of the late stage. He let out a light laugh, and his aura surged again.

"This..." The elders of Wenxin Sect wore expressions of shock. They had never before witnessed a secret technique elevate one's strength so terrifyingly.

Originally, Jiang Le Rong's Blue Lotus Transformation had already stunned them, making them believe she would surely win.

Yet they hadn't expected Zhang Daotian to be even more terrifying, possessing a secret technique of his own—apparently stronger than Jiang Le Rong's Blue Lotus Transformation.

"Pillar Soul Peak!" As the thunderous roar in Luo Tian's body resounded again, his cultivation level matched Jiang Le Rong's at the peak of Pillar Soul.

"Crack..." Luo Tian clenched his fists lightly, a confident expression on his face as he gazed at Jiang Le Rong charging toward him.

"It's over!" Luo Tian stepped into the Fengtian Step, becoming a blur of motion. Instead of retreating, he advanced with overwhelming pressure, causing Jiang Le Rong to pause in shock.

Though both were at the peak of Pillar Soul, this time Luo Tian was terrifying to Jiang Le Rong. She felt like an ordinary person facing a primordial beast, gasping for breath.

As Jiang Le Rong was stunned, Luo Tian's "Lunhui" punches struck her perfect body.

"Buzz..." The轮回 channel reappeared, drawing immense suction that targeted Jiang Le Rong's soul.

Chapter 637: The Bridal Offer?

The overwhelming power of the轮回 channel made Jiang Le Rong feel a surge of fear. Previously, when Luo Tian had used the "Lunhui" punches, she could still resist. But now, she was as helpless as a baby before him.

Gray soul energy was continuously torn from Jiang Le Rong's body, causing her excruciating pain.

"Enough! Jiang Lian has lost!" Xu Deshui saw Luo Tian's lack of restraint and spoke aloud, his voice resonating in Luo Tian's ears.

"Hmph," Luo Tian sneered, knowing he couldn't push too hard; if he harmed Jiang Le Rong, it would surely provoke a clash between the sects.

"But I can't let you off so easily!" Luo Tian's mind stirred, and he seized Jiang Le Rong's soul, yanking it forcefully.

"Ah..." Jiang Le Rong's veins bulged as an agonizing pain from her soul made her nearly collapse.

Under Luo Tian's pull, Jiang Le Rong's soul had an arm torn off and was thrown into the轮回 channel.

"Next time, don't provoke me!" Luo Tian grabbed Jiang Le Rong, his eyes flashing cold killing intent like two sharp swords piercing her soul.

"I won't let you live! You will die by my hand!" Jiang Le Rong's cold sweat dripped as she stared at Luo Tian with madness, her powerful spiritual awareness imprinting a voice into his mind.

Hearing Jiang Le Rong's words, Luo Tian's eyes flashed with fury again. He clenched his fists slightly before finally releasing Jiang Le Rong onto the ground.

Luo Tian wasn't unwilling to kill her, but under current circumstances, neither Wenxin Sect nor Siti Chen would allow him to act.

"Go..." Luo Tian sneered, kicking Jiang Le Rong's behind.

This kick wasn't too forceful but still enraged Jiang Le Rong, sending her flying in an arc toward Xu Deshui.

"Master, help me kill him!" Jiang Le Rong's eyes burned with fury as she glared at Luo Tian, her arm temporarily numb and dangling.

"Ugh?" Upon hearing Jiang Le Rong's words, two sharp glares locked onto her, and a killing intent surged throughout Wenxin Sect.

Under this hostility, the disciples of Wenxin Sect instinctively shivered, as did Jiang Yuanshui and others.

"Smack!" Xu Deshui slapped Jiang Le Rong's face, his voice cold: "Foolish! Victory and defeat are common. Wenxin Sect and Tian Dao Sect have long been allies. How could you say such words to provoke the sects!"

Jiang Le Rong was stunned by Xu Deshui's slap. She remembered that since entering this strange world, her master had always been kind to her, never hitting her. She had long regarded Xu Deshui as family. Now, she was struck by him, which made her struggle to accept it. Her gaze toward Luo Tian turned even colder.

"Xu Xiong, your disciple's temperament is so small?" Siti Chen sneered, his gaze icy toward Jiang Le Rong. He would not allow anyone with hostile intent toward Zhang Daotian to exist, even Jiang Le Rong. He would kill her without hesitation, even if it meant clashing with Wenxin Sect.

"Siti, don't be angry. This disciple has been spoiled by me; he lost his mind for a moment!" Xu Deshui, seeing Siti Chen's darkened face, explained gently.

"What are you still looking at? Go apologize to Zhang Daotian Senior!" Xu Deshui's face darkened, turning and shouting at Jiang Le Rong.

Jiang Le Rong gritted her teeth, her eyes burning with hatred toward Luo Tian. She took a deep breath and suddenly transformed into a different person, appearing before Luo Tian with a faint fragrance.

"Apologies, Zhang Senior. My younger sister was impulsive earlier; please don't take it to heart!" Jiang Le Rong's eyes showed respect, no longer the coldness from before.

Seeing this, Luo Tian sighed inwardly: "A woman with remarkable restraint!"

But Luo Tian's face also bore a smile as he bowed to Jiang Le Rong: "This is understandable. I was too harsh earlier; please don't take it to heart, Senior Sister!"

Hearing Luo Tian's words, the disciples of Wenxin Sect twitched their mouths, watching Jiang Le Rong in the sky.

At this moment, Jiang Le Rong was clearly at her most pitiful, with Luo Tian's punches and footprints all over her body. Even her buttocks and chest were marked with footprints. The disciples of Wenxin Sect muttered internally: "This is called being too harsh!"

It was the first time the disciples of Wenxin Sect had seen Li Menglian in such a pitiful state. Even Xi Tong and Meng Cheng felt relieved, having fought against Li Menglian before and knowing her strength well. Yet now she had suffered such a major loss at Zhang Daotian's hands.

Moreover, this Zhang Daotian had previously been a complete纨绔, listed as a blacklisted person by Wenxin Sect. Now he had defeated all of their prodigies.

Luo Tian and Jiang Le Rong exchanged pleasantries before standing behind Siti Chen and Xu Deshui.

"Alright, the rest of the matters you discuss with Yuanshui; after all, it's your two disciples' marriage. I'll personally attend when the wedding takes place!" Xu Deshui smiled as he spoke to Siti Chen.

Xu Deshui departed, and the other elders also said their farewells. Siti Chen accompanied them in polite conversation before following Jiang Yuanshui into his spacious cave.

Luo Tian and Zheng Xin followed Siti Chen and Jiang Yuanshui into Jiang Yuanshui's cave.

Siti Chen and Jiang Yuanshui sat down, while Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue stood behind them.

Jiang Yuanshui looked at Luo Tian, his mindset having changed. The more he observed Luo Tian, the more he liked him—his formidable strength, deep background, and having Siti Chen as a powerful patron. Zhang Daotian was truly without flaw.

"Siti Xiong, the matter is settled. I have no reason to refuse. Should we discuss the wedding date for the two children?" Jiang Yuanshui smiled as he spoke to Siti Chen.

"Old Jiang, the wedding date isn't urgent. My disciple marrying a wife can't be done for free; I, Siti Chen, still need to provide the dowry!" Siti Chen's face was calm as he looked at Jiang Yuanshui.

"Dowry?" Jiang Yuanshui's eyes brightened upon hearing Siti Chen's words. Others also showed interest, gazing at the composed Siti Chen.

Chapter 638: Preparations Before the Wedding

Siti Chen was the Grandmaster of the Dan Sect, a master alchemist. Whether in the Tianyuan Continent or the Xiangu Continent, he was a wealthy profession. As the Grandmaster of Dan Sect, naturally, he was overflowing with wealth. Thus, Siti Chen's dowry would certainly be of immense value.

Luo Tian chuckled lightly, surprised that Siti Chen still prepared a dowry like in the secular world. He felt touched and curious about what Siti Chen would present.

Seeing everyone's gaze on him, Siti Chen wore a triumphant expression and extended his hand. A jade bottle appeared in his grasp.

"Siti Xiong, the medicine—what grade is it?" Jiang Yuanshui's face showed disappointment. In his view, medicine was easily obtainable for Siti Chen, so it wasn't remarkable. It would be at most an eighth-grade elixir.

"Ninth-grade elixir, Hun Dun Zhen Luo Dan!" Siti Chen's face bore a proud expression as he looked at Jiang Yuanshui.

"Crack..." As Siti Chen's words fell, Jiang Yuanshui's teacup cracked and fell to the ground. He was stunned, then gazed at the seemingly ordinary jade bottle in Siti Chen's hand.

"Ninth-grade elixir!" Luo Tian and Ren Hongzhi also showed intense disbelief, gazing at Siti Chen.

"Siti, have you entered the ninth-grade alchemist level?" Jiang Yuanshui's face showed excitement as he looked at Siti Chen, awaiting his answer.

Luo Tian and others also watched Siti Chen with expectant expressions, their faces filled with disbelief.

A ninth-grade alchemist had never been heard of in the Tianyuan Continent, and even in the more advanced Xiangu Continent, no one had heard of such a figure.

The current Siti Chen was likely the ninth-grade alchemist, and if this were revealed, it would surely shock the entire Xiangu Continent.

"Hmm..." Siti Chen nodded calmly, answering Jiang Yuanshui's question with a simple nod.

This single "Hm" and the slight nod were enough to make the entire hall silent, save for heavy breathing.

"Uncle San, you're my beloved uncle! Can't you give me a few ninth-grade elixirs to taste what they're like!" Ren Hongzhi was the first to speak, kneeling before Siti Chen and hugging his legs while shouting.

"Uncle Shiba, Third Uncle..." Others saw this opportunity and wore sycophantic expressions, surrounding Siti Chen.

Luo Tian's lips twitched as he watched their shameless behavior, his face showing anger. He kicked them all away with a single foot.

"You have no shame! This is Wenxin Sect, and you've brought disgrace here!" Luo Tian spoke loudly, his gaze serious.

"Ah..." Upon being scolded by Luo Tian, Ren Hongzhi and others felt their own shame. In their excitement, they returned to their senses, standing up but still gazing longingly at Siti Chen sitting calmly behind Luo Tian.

"You all are so old, yet you still can't be composed! You're truly embarrassing!" Luo Tian spoke again, shouting at Ren Hongzhi and others as if scolding his sons.

Hearing Luo Tian's righteous words, Siti Chen wore a satisfied expression, secretly praising his disciple for growing so much.

Jiang Yuanshui also wore a satisfied expression, watching Luo Tian scold Ren Hongzhi and others with his words.

"You really think ninth-grade elixirs are so easy to refine? Master, I am your direct disciple. The fat is not spilled outside; you must give it to me first!" Luo Tian turned around, wearing a sycophantic expression and greedy gaze as he approached Siti Chen.

"Pu..." Jiang Yuanshui spat out the tea he had just swallowed, coughing heavily. He mentally cursed himself for being blind-eyed.

"Dammit, you're the most shameless!" Ren Hongzhi and others shouted as they saw Luo Tian's lecherous appearance.

Gu Qianxue stood behind Jiang Yuanshui, laughing lightly as she watched Luo Tian's antics. She felt no annoyance but found him increasingly endearing.

"Get out..." Siti Chen kicked Luo Tian away and handed the jade bottle to Jiang Yuanshui.

"Old Jiang, I assume you've been stuck at the Pillar Soul Peak for years. This Hun Dun Zhen Luo Dan can help you grasp the essence of chaos. Whether or not you succeed depends on your own efforts. After all, you've nurtured this disciple for so long; it's辛苦!" Siti Chen wore a contemplative expression.

Siti Chen and Jiang Yuanshui had been friends for years, and their relationship was good. Otherwise, Zhang Daotian wouldn't have been arranged to marry Yao Biyue. Though there had been some conflict before, Siti Chen still valued this long-time friend.

"This elixir is the dowry; naturally, it's for Biyue. I can't touch it!" Jiang Yuanshui shook his head slightly, declining and passing the jade bottle to Gu Qianxue.

"Master, just take it. If your strength increases, when this fellow bullies me, you can help beat him!" Gu Qianxue smiled and pushed the jade bottle back into Jiang Yuanshui's hands.

"Old Jiang, just take it. I've already prepared for the two children. And you all little rascals, don't rush; I'll make up for you later!" Siti Chen was in high spirits and made promises.

Luo Tian stood quietly by the side, his face softening slightly. No one noticed the brief sorrow in his eyes—only Gu Qianxue glanced at him, her gaze flickering slightly.

Siti Chen waved his hand again, and the hall filled with powerful energy, making Ren Hongzhi and others envious.

"High-grade land-level inner armor... eighth-grade elixirs..." Ren Hongzhi and others stared in awe at the mountain-like pile of medicinal treasures, marveling at Siti Chen's generosity.

Jiang Yuanshui was also stunned, his heart aching as he suddenly thought of Gu Qianxue's dowry.

He had prepared two high-grade land-level treasures, but seeing Siti Chen's dowry, he felt his own two treasures were inadequate.

Seeming to sense Jiang Yuanshui's awkwardness, Siti Chen chuckled and exchanged a few polite words with him before setting the wedding date for half a month later. Then he left Wenxin Sect with Luo Tian and Ren Hongzhi, as the big wedding was a major event requiring preparation.

Luo Tian wore a smile as he said goodbye to Gu Qianxue, sighing deeply before vanishing into her gentle gaze.

Chapter 639: The Soul of Chen Yuting

Night, the moonlight glistened on the peaks of Tian Dao Sect. The once-bustling Tian Dao Sect fell into silence, with only the sound of spiritual energy fluctuations echoing across its corners—its disciples diligently cultivating.

Luo Tian sat in his luxurious cave, moonlight casting across his face. He waved his hand, and a heavy aura rose in the cave, startling the Yuanling-level disciples guarding outside. After realizing it was the Master's room, they resumed their meditation.

"Crack..." Luo Tian smiled gently as he lifted the lid of the Zhen Hun Ding, revealing three wisps of gray energy.

"Zhao Brother!" Luo Tian smiled as he gazed at the two figures entwined in the shadows.

"Daotian, this jar is truly miraculous! It has the same function as the轮回 Bridge! I will repay this favor, Zhao Fengshan!" Zhao Fengshan's face showed gratitude as he prepared to kneel before Luo Tian.

At the same time, Zhao Fengshan's wife, who had been awakened by some method, also knelt with him.

"Zhao Brother, what are your plans next? I have a way to refine bodies for you, but it will take some time. Alternatively, I can kill several great villains to let you and your wife possess their bodies. The former is difficult, the latter simple. Choose one of them; no need to say thanks. Since I've saved you, I'll help until the end!" Luo Tian smiled as he addressed Zhao Fengshan and his wife.

"Brother Daotian, I won't say thanks; it's all up to you. If we truly have a day of resurrection, our lives will be yours!" Zhao Fengshan bowed deeply.

"Then, I'll trouble you both to stay in the Zhen Hun Ding for a while!" Luo Tian spoke softly, reabsorbing Zhao Fengshan and his wife into the Zhen Hun Ding.

After finishing this, Luo Tian turned to gaze at Chen Yuting's soul, his face filled with endless tenderness. He reached out to touch her ethereal face but passed through it.

"Where is your other soul?" Luo Tian sighed softly.

Luo Tian knew Chen Yuting's soul was different from Zhao Fengshan's; Zhao Fengshan and his wife had complete souls, though their consciousness was erased. But Chen Yuting's soul was incomplete, only half—this left Luo Tian in a dilemma.

Chen Yuting's残魂 seemed to not understand Luo Tian's words, merely drifting toward him with a calm gaze.

"Yuting, do you know I'm getting married?" Luo Tian sighed and recounted to Chen Yuting how he met Gu Qianxue and the experiences they had. He spoke for nearly half the night.

"I can sense you like this girl, Gu Qianxue! She's a good girl!" Chen Yuting finally spoke after listening.

"But why do I feel sad? Is it because we knew each other before?" Chen Yuting's face showed confusion, her voice ethereal.

"My heart has a barrier—that is because you haven't returned to life!" Luo Tian sat down gently.

"Because... because..." Chen Yuting repeated softly, her eyes alternating between confusion and clarity.

Finally, she laughed lightly, her ethereal voice echoing in Luo Tian's heart: "Go marry this girl. I'm sure if I were alive, I wouldn't have blamed you. I can sense it!"

Hearing Chen Yuting's words, Luo Tian's heart trembled. He then smiled bitterly—Chen Yuting could forgive him, but Luo Tian couldn't overcome his own barrier.

"Yanghun Jade!" Luo Tian sighed softly, retrieving the Yanghun Jade from his storage bag. He spoke to Chen Yuting before absorbing her soul into the jade.

After all, Chen Yuting's soul was incomplete and couldn't stay outside long. Moreover, Luo Tian hoped the Yanghun Jade could help her recover some strength.

"Sigh..." Luo Tian sighed again, lying down on the bed without cultivating. His mind kept replaying Chen Yuting and Gu Qianxue's images, even thinking of Leng Qiuchan.

Morning sunlight awakened Luo Tian, who opened his eyes and strode out of the Tian Dao Sect. His face bore a gentle expression as he lightly touched his waist's Yanghun Jade, smiling softly.

"Little Master..." The disciples of the Dan Sect wore expressions of reverence. Now, Zhang Daotian was their pride; his wedding was a monumental event in their eyes.

Ten thousand Dan Sect disciples began bustling early, and other sects' disciples also came to help. After all, Mu Rongcheng had announced that Zhang Daotian was the Young Sect Leader of Tian Dao Sect.

Luo Tian smiled all the way, greeting the Dan Sect disciples and wandering through each peak of Tian Dao Sect. He exuded a serene aura.

At this moment, Luo Tian felt he had fully integrated into Tian Dao Sect, into this world that was either an illusion or reality. Tian Dao Sect had given him a sense of belonging, equal to the Five Elements Sect in his heart.

The Five Elements Sect had Feng Qianyu, Dong Sansi, Lei Yong, Ji Chen—friends who had supported him. There were also kind senior brothers. Tian Dao Sect had Ren Hongzhi and others, and a doting Siti Chen.

"Daotian, congratulations!"
"You really did it! You're about to get married!" Ren Hongzhi and others appeared before Luo Tian, shouting loudly.

Zheng Xin wore a complex expression as she watched Luo Tian, thinking of Leng Qiuchan. Both Leng Qiuchan and Luo Tian were Zheng Xin's friends, and she hoped they would end up together. Now that Luo Tian was getting married, Zheng Xin wondered if Leng Qiuchan could withstand the news. She clearly knew Leng Qiuchan loved Luo Tian to her bones.

"Ha! Alright, stop mocking me! You all will get married too, Hongzhi. When are you going to bring that girl from Starry Hall? And you Shao Yong, do you think I don't know about your secret rendezvous with that girl?" Luo Tian saw Ren Hongzhi and others, his face returning to its纨绔 demeanor, cursing as he played with them.

Seeing Luo Tian's behavior, Zheng Xin sighed helplessly. Watching Luo Tian laughing and playing with Ren Hongzhi, her eyes glowed: "Daotian, you're about to get married. Should we talk for three days and nights?"

"Get lost..." Luo Tian and Ren Hongzhi kicked Zheng Xin away with a single foot.

Chapter 640: The Wedding Begins

Fifteen days later, Tian Dao Sect was filled with joy. Long streaks of light continuously converged toward the sect, all smiling as they were welcomed by Tian Dao Sect disciples.

In a plaza that could hold tens of thousands, rows of tables were neatly arranged. Tian Dao Sect disciples continuously placed various drinks on the tables. Everyone smiled, for their little master, Young Sect Leader of Tian Dao Sect, was getting married today.

The nine elders of Tian Dao Sect sat on a floating platform in the sky, their faces beaming. Siti Chen's face was almost smiling open, wearing a red robe for the first time. He sat at the main seat, today being the master of Tian Dao Sect.

The eight elders of Wenxin Sect sat at the secondary seat, while Jiang Yuanshui also wore a red robe, his aura radiating power. He had just领悟ed a fragment of chaos energy but was still struggling to control it.

"You two old men, today you're both dressed so joyfully. It feels like you're the ones getting married!" The elders of both sects joked.

"Go to hell! I'm just happy today, what's wrong with that!" Jiang Yuanshui was in high spirits. Not only had he领悟ed a fragment of chaos energy, but he was also happy his disciple found Zhang Daotian as a suitable partner.

"Ha! Siti, congratulations!" The sound of breaking air echoed continuously from the sky, with powerful auras entering the perception of the elders.

"Old Li, I didn't expect you to come first!" A loud laugh echoed from the void, making Siti Chen and Jiang Yuanshui stand up.

Others could be handled by Tian Dao Sect disciples, but for the elders of Twelve Sects, they had to personally greet them.

Numerous invisible hands appeared, tearing open the void. Powerful auras emerged from it, with elders and young people stepping out of the void.

Siti Chen waved his hand, and tables and chairs appeared on the grand platform. He smiled: "All my old friends! It's been years since we last met. Let's gather today!"

Siti Chen's voice, like a thunderclap, echoed in the minds of those arriving, shaking their spirits. This was his full power with a touch of chaos energy.

"Unlocked a fragment of chaos energy!" The elders from other sects showed slight surprise, some happy, others worried.

"Ha! I didn't expect the rumors to be true. Siti Xiong truly unlocked a fragment of chaos energy! A double joy!" The elder from Starry Hall smiled, sitting on the platform.

"Siti, it's been years! You've become a powerhouse now!" A black-cloaked elder showed some fear, gazing at Siti Chen. This was the Grandmaster of the Darkness God Sect, with Huang Xiande standing behind him, his face calm.

Others also expressed their congratulations, for Siti Chen unlocking a fragment of chaos energy and even rumors of him becoming a ninth-grade alchemist made no one dare to underestimate him.

Siti Chen's full roar was meant to intimidate. Though the Twelve Sects seemed harmonious, they were actually in turmoil. Some sects were friendly with Tian Dao Sect, while others had different intentions. Siti Chen wanted to tell these powerful elders that today was his disciple's wedding, so they should all behave.

"Ha! All my old elders, how are you?" Jiang Yuanshui laughed loudly, scanning the elders and bowing to them.

"Jiang Yuanshui, you too!" As Jiang Yuanshui spoke, the elders of Twelve Sects showed shock. They hadn't expected Jiang Yuanshui to unlock a fragment of chaos energy as well.

"Ha! It was just luck! Thanks to Siti Xiong's elixirs!" Jiang Yuanshui smiled proudly, his eyes showing gratitude.

"Snort..." Hearing Jiang Yuanshui's words, people turned their gaze back to Siti Chen. His words had already indicated that Siti Chen had entered the ninth-grade alchemist level. Immediately, all elders showed respect, even the Grandmasters of each sect looked at Siti Chen with changed expressions.

"Alright, today we're not the main characters. Just sit here quietly. If anyone wants elixirs, talk tomorrow! I'm in a good mood these days; if you bring your own herbs, I'll refine them for free!" Siti Chen smiled as he spoke to the elders.

"Boom... boom... boom..." The heavy bell rang, a sound only used for major sect events. Today, it was struck three times on Siti Chen's behalf, shaking the disciples of Tian Dao Sect and making them cheer.

Luo Tian stood at the entrance of his cave, wearing a red robe. Ren Hongzhi and others smiled, their hands moving rapidly.

"Roar..." A hundred-zhang-long dragon of spiritual energy appeared in the sky.

"Go up, brother!" Ren Hongzhi and Zheng Xin grabbed Luo Tian and threw him onto the dragon of spiritual energy.

"Today, I'm getting married! Yuting, you should be happy for me!" Luo Tian gently touched his waist's Yanghun Jade, smiling softly.

Fifteen days had allowed Luo Tian to let go of much. He couldn't let go of Yuting, nor could he let go of Gu Qianxue. He would eventually marry Gu Qianxue, and if he refused, she'd be heartbroken.

At the same time, a phoenix made of dense spiritual energy appeared far away from Tian Dao Sect. Gu Qianxue stood on the phoenix's head, wearing a red wedding dress. A red veil covered her head, and she radiated tension, making Yu Mingxue smile beside her.

"What's wrong? The bride is regretting it, right? If you do, I'll take your place!" Yu Mingxue's words made her pause.

Gu Qianxue turned, confused, and said: "Sister, you know how to tease me!"

Yu Mingxue felt awkward about her earlier words. Though she often teased her younger sister, this time she didn't know why a sense of replacement had arisen.
