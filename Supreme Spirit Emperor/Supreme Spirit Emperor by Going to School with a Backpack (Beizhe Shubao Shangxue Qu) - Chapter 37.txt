Upon hearing Wei Mingxuan's words, the disciples of the Five Elements Sect gazed at him with burning eyes. Indeed, Wei Mingxuan's speech had won the hearts of every disciple within the sect.
If Wei Mingxuan truly handed over Luo Tian, what then? If a disciple of the sect offended a major sect's disciples, would they too be handed over? Naturally, they also wished to hand Luo Tian over, for this matter would then subside. Out on the road, they need not live in constant fear. Human nature is often so conflicted.
Hearing Wei Mingxuan's words, Du Yongchang naturally knew he would not accept his proposal. He let out a cold laugh: "So our sect's genius is to die in vain? Moreover, one of our elders perished because of this boy within the Dian Forest!"
"Your elder's death, do you blame us? Why don't you go find them in the Dian Forest? You dare not? Do you think our Five Elements Sect is a soft plum?" Wu Ping'an's mood was foul. He had heard that the Xuan Yin Sect maintained ties with the Yellower Sect of the Southern Region.
His disciple, Gu Lei, had been taken by the Yellower Sect; how could he offer a friendly face to the Xuan Yin Sect, which had ties with them?
" Wu Ping'an, what are you? Daring to speak thus to our sect's master!" a Xuan Yin Sect elder named Yuan Ling cried out.
"What am I? It's not your place to inquire!" Wu Pingan sneered.
The atmosphere grew tense again, as both sides' Yuan Ling Realm masters gathered their power. Any word from Wei Mingxuan or Du Yongchang would trigger an attack.
"Du Yongchang, speak your terms," Wei Mingxuan's face flickered with impatience as he asked.
"First, either you hand over Luo Tian, or you surrender the treasure he obtained in the Dian Forest. Third, I demand three slots in your Five Elements Sect's Washing Spirit Pool. Choose one of these," Du Yongchang declared coldly under the gaze of the Five Elements Sect disciples.
Chapter 176: Slots in the Washing Spirit Pool
Chapter 176: Slots in the Washing Spirit Pool
"Daydreaming!" As Du Yongchang's words fell, the Five Elements Sect's various peak masters all shouted in unison.
"Du, do you think we Five Elements Sect fear you? With just your kind, how dare you seek slots in the Washing Spirit Pool? You don't even deserve it!" Wu Pingan spoke again.
Some of the Five Elements Sect's new disciples, unaware of what the Washing Spirit Pool was in their eyes, asked their senior brothers.
"The Washing Spirit Pool is a sacred place within our Five Elements Sect. Its spiritual energy is at its peak, forming a spiritual spring over time. Any disciple of the Cultivation Body Realm who trains there will see their cultivation multiply several times over. It is said that it also holds the opportunity to enter the Bone-Transforming Realm."
Hearing this explanation, the new disciples' faces showed awe. Then came a fervent expression. With hundreds of thousands of Five Elements Sect disciples, and countless others stuck at the Cultivation Body Ninth Stage, they knew the Washing Spirit Pool's power. How could they not be excited?
"Kid! Don't dream of it! It opens every three years, and only ten slots are available. They've already been snatched by the peak masters' and elders' direct disciples, leaving no chance for us!" One disciple patted his junior's shoulder.
"Master, perhaps Luo Tian should hand over what he obtained in the Dian Forest," Huang Jingshan said after hearing Du Yongchang's words.
"Luo Tian, for the Five Elements Sect's peace, you should surrender what you obtained in the Dian Forest. I believe Dan殿 can bear this sacrifice!" Huang Jingshan's face was solemn as he addressed Luo Tian.
"Huang Jingshan, don't be so foolish! If you persist in clinging to Dan殿, I won't mind making you look foolish before both sects!" Zhang Ziping's face turned icy, his aura suddenly coalescing. His anger had been fully ignited by Huang Jingshan's actions.
"Master Zhang! I am merely considering the sect's interests!" Huang Jingshan wore a righteous expression, standing tall as if willing to sacrifice everything for the sect.
The Five Elements Sect disciples naturally heard Huang Jingshan's words, their faces showing admiration. Dan殿's domineering image had long been entrenched in other peaks; Huang Jingshan's words completely positioned him as a peak master resisting Dan殿's threats.
Other peak masters, seeing Huang Jingshan's passionate speech, felt a flicker of contempt mixed with admiration. In just a few sentences, he had drawn most Five Elements Sect disciples to his side.
Wei Mingxuan secretly sighed at Zhang Ziping's youth, though his strength was formidable, he lacked experience.
"Huang Peak Master," Luo Tian bowed respectfully, drawing everyone's attention to himself.
Luo Tian and Lei Yong could not fly yet, so they stood on the ground listening to the elders' dialogue.
"Luo Tian!" People gazed at this unassuming youth, none would have imagined that such a deep conflict between two sects was closely tied to this young man.
"Is he Luo Tian?" Du Yongchang's face darkened as he looked at Luo Tian. He had seen Luo Tian's portrait, but upon seeing the real thing, he failed to recognize him. Luo Tian's appearance was too ordinary, not resembling a genius of any major sect—his looks even lagged behind those of secular city lords' disciples.
"Of course! For the sect's sake, it is a duty!" Huang Jingshan spoke without hesitation.
"Good! Then for the sect's sake, I, Luo Tian, say this: if Huang Peak Master hands over all treasures he has obtained, then I will surrender the opportunity I gained in the Dian Forest to secure the sect's peace. I believe Huang Peak Master, for the sake of the sect, would be willing to part with these things!" Luo Tian spoke resolutely and without arrogance.
"Ugh..." People were taken aback by Luo Tian's words, not expecting him to counter like this.
"Kid! You're being unreasonable!" Huang Jingshan's face turned grim, not expecting Luo Tian to retaliate.
"Yellow! Come on, bring it out! If you can produce all your treasures, then our Five Elements Sect will be at peace. Huang Great Peak Master, for the Five Elements Sect's sake, you are not afraid of sacrificing everything, right?" Lu Kunpeng said with mockery.
The surrounding peak masters felt a cold smile: "Good for you, Huang Jingshan, for overreaching!"
At the same time, these peak masters secretly praised Luo Tian's wit. One sentence had placed Huang Jingshan in an impossible position.
Huang Jingshan's face turned red, his mouth feeling as if he had swallowed a fly. He was now in an awkward position—refusing would be self-defeating, while surrendering would require sacrifice. A Yuan Ling Realm master's wealth was far greater than Luo Tian's.
He glanced at everyone watching him, his face turning purple with embarrassment.
Meanwhile, Du Yongchang and others watched the Five Elements Sect's internal conflict with interest. Some disciples even fetched food from somewhere, sitting on the dragon's back to eat.
"Enough! All of you shut up!" Wei Mingxuan coldly surveyed everyone.
This glance made people instinctively shiver, then they remembered the Xuan Yin Sect's presence. They had started fighting among themselves first.
"Du Yongchang, the slots in the Washing Spirit Pool are very important to our Five Elements Sect. Please change your conditions," Wei Mingxuan reprimanded everyone, then continued to Du Yongchang.
"Hmph! I'll make one more concession: let our three young disciples compete for your Washing Spirit Pool slots. Whether they succeed or not, the feud between our two sects will be settled. How about that?" Du Yongchang sneered, revealing his final limit.
"How? The Five Elements Sect is known as the top sect of Tianyuan, do you lack this much confidence? Or are your young disciples such cowards that they fear losing to our Xuan Yin Sect, thus feeling ashamed?" The black-cloaked elder who had first attacked the Five Elements Sect's mountain defense spoke, his gaze filled with contempt towards the Five Elements Sect.
"Provocation?" The Five Elements Sect disciples understood the black-cloaked elder's words, but they could do nothing.
"Master Wei, I've already laid out my底线. If you truly refuse to accept it, then prepare for mutual destruction!" Du Yongchang, seeing Wei Mingxuan's hesitation, pressed.
Chapter 177: The Challenge
Seeing Du Yongchang's aggressive stance, Wei Mingxuan's face darkened.
"Master! Accept it! Let them see our Five Elements Sect's genius!" The Five Elements Sect disciples all shouted, confident in their peak masters' disciples.
"Good!" Wei Mingxuan resolved himself and spoke.
"Haha, Master Wei, you must know that our Xuan Yin Sect is composed of killers; we only kill, never injure. If someone dies in the process, don't blame us for being ruthless—only blame your own lack of skill!" Du Yongchang smiled coldly, his gaze lingering on Luo Tian for a moment.
Understanding Du Yongchang's hidden intent, Luo Tian realized this was an attempt to eliminate him—open and blatant.
Others also knew Du Yongchang's intention, but upon seeing Luo Tian's cultivation had only reached the Cultivation Body Eighth Stage, they shook their heads.
Only a few Yuan Ling Realm and Bone-Transforming Peak masters felt the terrifying fluctuations from Luo Tian's body, sighing inwardly. What confidence did Du Yongchang have that his disciples could defeat such a formidable Luo Tian?
Du Yongchang was no fool; he could sense how strong Luo Tian had become. However, when his gaze fell upon the three young men standing behind him on the dragon's back, a confident expression appeared on his face—especially towards one of them, a cold-faced youth who even showed slight reverence.
"Here are the disciples we will send for the Washing Spirit Pool slots!" Du Yongchang pointed to the three young men behind him and smiled.
"This is Shi Fengyu, this is Gao Jie! You are not unfamiliar with these names, I assume?" Du Yongchang introduced the two young men behind him to the Five Elements Sect.
Hearing these names, the Five Elements Sect disciples showed anger; these two names had become renowned within the sect recently.
Among those present, Ru Fengqianyu and Zhang Hongyun saw these two and displayed intense battle intent.
"Shi Fengyu, a direct disciple of the Xuan Yin Sect's Grand Elder, a dual-element genius of fire and earth. He once assassinated a Bone-Transforming Realm master, leaving him severely wounded and escaping from his grasp. In conflicts with the Five Elements Sect, he has killed many, and those who have fought him never returned alive—often unaware of how they died."
"Gao Jie, same as Shi Fengyu. No one who he hunts has ever escaped! He is elusive and his cultivation is astonishing. It's said the Xuan Yin Sect has already designated these two as candidates for the next sect leader, choosing one among them!" The Five Elements Sect disciples loudly discussed, their eyes burning as they gazed at the three ice-cold figures.
As for the third person, the Five Elements Sect disciples could not recognize him, but being with these two indicated his high status.
"Jinguang Peak, Zhang Hongyun! Step forward to compete for the Washing Spirit Pool slots!" Wei Mingxuan's calm face called out Zhang Hongyun's name.
Zhang Hongyun, standing on the ground, heard his name called by Wei Mingxuan. His aura surged as he stepped out from the crowd, gazing at the three with fierce battle intent.
Seeing Zhang Hongyun step out, the Five Elements Sect disciples erupted in cheers. Over these months of conflict with the Xuan Yin Sect, Zhang Hongyun had gained great fame.
"Feng Qianyu... Yang Huanyu... Geng Minghui..." A string of names came from Wei Mingxuan's mouth.
Each time a name was called, it triggered cheers from the Five Elements Sect disciples. These names were well-known across various peaks and had earned much recognition among the sect's disciples during their conflicts with the Xuan Yin Sect.
"Dan殿! Luo Tian!" Finally, Wei Mingxuan's gaze settled on Luo Tian.
However, as soon as Luo Tian's name was called, the cheers were not as enthusiastic as before. Only a few people cheered, mostly disciples from Dan殿.
Clearly, this matter was caused by Luo Tian, leaving the Five Elements Sect disciples with some resentment.
Including Luo Tian, ten of the Five Elements Sect's geniuses stood there—undoubtedly among the most outstanding disciples in this realm.
"Alas..." Luo Tian sighed lightly, standing at the end of the group. He didn't care much for the Washing Spirit Pool slots, but since this matter had started because of him, he hoped it would end with himself.
"You ten listen carefully! These slots were originally prepared for you. Now that someone wants to take them, it means one of you might lose this opportunity!" Wei Mingxuan's words were concise.
"Whether these ten slots become yours or are taken by others depends on your own strength! You all know the Xuan Yin Sect's ruthless nature. If you wish to withdraw, say so now!" Wei Mingxuan added with a slight gravity.
Withdraw? Not only the Washing Spirit Pool slots, but also the pride of being a genius—none among them would choose to withdraw. If they did, tomorrow they would bear the names of cowards and weaklings. Clearly, these were not what they desired.
The ten disciples showed determined expressions; none chose to withdraw.
Wei Mingxuan nodded in satisfaction, his spiritual sense projecting a final message into their minds: "If you can kill, do so. If not, prioritize your survival!"
The ten disciples nodded silently and said nothing more.
Luo Tian looked at the other nine, knowing Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu's strength. Even his former self would have found them challenging, but after this time, they surely wouldn't be stagnant. As for the others, he believed they would not be much worse than these two.
"Master Wei, stop talking and start!" Du Yongchang's face showed impatience as he shouted.
"Hmph, it's simple: two people fight and rank them. The top ten will enter," Wei Mingxuan briefly explained the rules before speaking.
"If there's no objection, we can begin!" Wei Mingxuan spoke coldly.
The group marched solemnly to the Five Elements Arena, where grand contests were held by the sect.
"Master Wei, I have a proposal!" Shi Fengyu's face showed a slight smile, his voice not loud but reaching everyone's ears.
"Speak!" Wei Mingxuan was unpleased at a junior interrupting him, his face cold as he glanced at Du Yongchang.
Chapter 178: The Might
Shi Fengyu ignored Wei Mingxuan's cold words, instead casting a provocative gaze at the Five Elements Sect's ten disciples.
"Since this is a contest between two sects, there's no need for internal conflict. Let us three face your ten instead! Whoever loses steps down! How about that?" Shi Fengyu, with a mocking expression, spoke to the ten.
"Arrogant!" Some of the ten disciples sneered, clearly不满 with Shi Fengyu's challenge.
"You're afraid, aren't you?" Gao Jie added, further igniting the crowd's resentment.
"How will the rankings be determined?" Some elders asked with confusion.
"If any of us three doesn't make it into the top five, we'll automatically withdraw!" Shi Fengyu confidently declared.
His words immediately caused a uproar among the Five Elements Sect: "Too arrogant! Feng Senior, let's show him! Don't let our Five Elements Sect's name be tarnished!"
"Geng Junior, it's up to you! Show the might of our Water Moon Peak!" Each peak's disciples cheered for their respective disciples.
Wei Mingxuan knew he had to accept this junior's condition; otherwise, it would be said that the Five Elements Sect was weak.
"Fine!" Wei Mingxuan's face remained cold as he agreed.
Hearing Wei Mingxuan's agreement, Shi Fengyu showed a hint of joy. He leaped onto the arena and gazed at Luo Tian's group with arrogance, his finger slightly raised: "Who will come to die first!"
Luo Tian remained still, not moving. Though Shi Fengyu and Gao Jie felt powerful, he was more wary of the silent black-cloaked youth.
This young man gave Luo Tian a cold feeling—so cold that one wouldn't dare approach him easily.
"Shi Fengyu, I've long wanted to fight you! Let me challenge you!" A disciple shouted and stepped forward toward Shi Fengyu.
"Oh, if I'm not mistaken, you're Geng Minghui, right? Good, for your courage, I'll grant you a full corpse!" Shi Fengyu's voice, like charity, reached Geng Minghui's ears.
This voice ignited Geng Minghui like oil in a fire, his roar: "Die!"
A blue hand emerged, filled with dense water-element spiritual energy, slamming toward Shi Fengyu.
"Boom..." A deep sound echoed as the blue hand slammed onto the arena floor.
"His speed is fast!" Geng Minghui marveled internally, his face full of shock. His spiritual energy hand was already fast, but it only hit Shi Fengyu's afterimage.
"Kid, I said to grant you a full corpse—so I will! I keep my promises!" Shi Fengyu's voice echoed from all directions around Geng Minghui.
Geng Minghui felt a strong killing intent surrounding him, so he dared not move. Cold sweat flowed down his face; he knew that any movement would bring a fatal strike.
"Thinking you can stay still and have no flaws? Speak your last words quickly, or it'll be too late!" Shi Fengyu's voice echoed again.
Geng Minghui, at this moment, dared not even breathe deeply, his eyes fixed on all directions, trying to find Shi Fengyu's trace.
"Since you have no last words, then it's time for you to die!" Shi Fengyu felt he had enough and smiled.
"Poof..." A faint sound like cutting silk echoed.
Geng Minghui stared ahead with a look of disbelief, his mouth open as if to say something. But his mouth wouldn't move; a tiny wound appeared on his throat.
"Minhui!" A mournful cry echoed from the Water Moon Peak, it was the peak master of Water Moon. Geng Minghui was his favorite disciple.
Now, with his most beloved disciple dead, how could he not be heartbroken? His eyes stared at Shi Fengyu's revealed form, his face filled with killing intent. If not for so many people present, he would have rushed forward to crush Shi Fengyu.
Finally, reason prevailed over his anger; the Water Moon Peak master carried Geng Minghui's corpse before everyone's eyes and vanished.
The Water Moon Peak master and the Flame Peak master watched the elder's somewhat desolate figure, sighing gently. Their eyes swept over Feng Qianyu, a look of concern on their faces—Shi Fengyu's strength had clearly exceeded their expectations.
The Five Elements Sect disciples were stunned, watching the figure of Geng Minghui leaving. In just a few breaths, their formidable disciple had been killed without even a chance to fight.
Wei Mingxuan and the various peak masters showed expressions of concern; they hadn't expected Shi Fengyu to be so strong. He was definitely among the top few in the Cultivation Body Realm.
The remaining eight disciples beside Luo Tian also looked grimly at Shi Fengyu standing proudly on the arena. This young man gave them a strong pressure, with two or three showing a hint of fear. Their strength was similar to Geng Minghui's, and if they faced the battle, they would surely follow Geng Minghui's path.
They quietly stepped back, even moving to the end of the line behind Luo Tian.
Du Yongkang showed a triumphant smile: "Haha, Master Wei, the Five Elements Sect disciples are truly modest! I'll thank Fengyu for his mercy on this junior!"
Du Yongkang's words caused the Xuan Yin Sect side to display satisfaction, looking at the Five Elements Sect disciples with smugness.
The Five Elements Sect was all grim-faced; this first battle had instantly compressed their previously unyielding momentum, leaving them like withered eggplants.
"Shi Fengyu, don't be so proud! I'll fight you!" Feng Qianyu, like a nimble leopard, leaped onto the arena with a long staff in hand.
"Feng Qianyu, Senior Feng!" The Five Elements Sect disciples saw the white-cloaked Zhang Hongyun on the arena, their eyes showing hope.
"Feng Senior, fight hard! Let's avenge Geng Senior!" The Water Peak disciples shouted as they saw Feng Qianyu.
Feng Qianyu, a disciple of both the Water and Flame Peaks, had high popularity and status in both peaks. Seeing his teacher's sorrow, Feng Qianyu could not bear to see him sad. Since they had to fight anyway, he stepped forward directly.
"Feng Qianyu? You're the famous Feng Qianyu? I've heard that many of our Xuan Yin Sect disciples have died at your hands. Today, let me avenge those who fell under the Xuan Yin Sect!"
Chapter 179: The Clash
Hearing Shi Fengyu's words, Feng Qianyu remained calm, his eyes fixed on the arrogant youth. He spoke lightly: "Enough talk; fight!"
Feng Qianyu was not a verbose person. After his cold words, he vanished, spiritual energy of red and blue swirling around him as he swung the staff with an unstoppable momentum toward Shi Fengyu.
"Water and Fire Dual Elements?" Shi Fengyu was surprised to see Feng Qianyu also had dual-element cultivation. He secretly marveled at Feng Qianyu's talent, able to coexist two conflicting elements within one body.
Shi Fengyu dared not be careless, his form disappearing from people's perception again, even his aura vanished.
"The Xuan Yin Sect truly is a sect of killers; merely this inherited martial arts technique would make them unbeatable against ordinary opponents!" The Flame Peak master, Si Tu Anle, sighed.
"Yes, but to rely solely on martial arts to defeat this kid is still impossible!" The Water Moon Peak master's face showed a hint of confidence, obviously well aware of his disciple.
Luo Tian had fought an Xuan Yin Sect Bone-Transforming Realm master in the Dian Forest, naturally knowing that the Xuan Yin Sect had a mysterious martial art. If it weren't for his strong spiritual sense, he would have died at the Dian Forest's perimeter.
Luo Tian also wanted to see how Feng Qianyu would solve this problem.
While they spoke, Feng Qianyu's staff slammed into the void.
The sound of weapons colliding echoed out, and Shi Fengyu blocked Feng Qianyu's staff with his own.
Shi Fengyu was surprised; he didn't know how Feng Qianyu found him, his mind now more cautious. He let out a low roar: "Xuanming Step!"
With Shi Fengyu's low roar, his form vanished again like the wind. This time, his speed was even faster, appearing as countless Shi Fengyu figures in people's vision.
"Too fast!" The Five Elements Sect disciples all marveled, their hearts worrying for Feng Qianyu.
Feng Qianyu's eyes turned blood-red, his face showing unprecedented seriousness. He stood the staff before him, hands moving constantly to form a Taijitu pattern with both water and fire elements between his hands. This was Feng Qianyu's renowned technique, the Ice-Fire Dual-Element Palm.
As time passed and his cultivation increased, Feng Qianyu had improved this technique significantly. Now, the massive Taijitu on his chest emitted countless blue and red hands, filling the entire arena and submerging Shi Fengyu's form.
"This kid is truly a prodigy! Not only has he coexisted with both water and fire elements in his body, but this technique must also be self-created!" The Xuan Yin Sect's master watched Feng Qianyu with admiration. A genius who dares to research—such a person would surely achieve greatness, no one could doubt it!
The arena echoed with continuous thunderous sounds. Clearly, Shi Fengyu's speed could not escape the countless palm prints.
After the thunderous sounds, Shi Fengyu appeared in a disheveled state. He never expected Feng Qianyu to be so tenacious; he definitely could not continue being passive. He stopped using his martial arts and let out a low roar, pushing his speed to the limit. A dark staff glowed with an幽寒 light, swiftly stabbing toward Feng Qianyu.
Feng Qianyu saw Shi Fengyu no longer fleeing, and he felt a sigh of relief. The Ice-Fire Dual-Element Palm had consumed much from him, and using it twice was already his limit.
He picked up the staff beside him, ignoring the approaching staff, and swung it fiercely toward Shi Fengyu's head.
"This kid is crazy!" The surrounding people all couldn't understand why Feng Qianyu didn't block Shi Fengyu's staff. Only four people showed smiles.
These four were Feng Qianyu's two masters, the peak masters of Water and Flame Peaks. The other two were Luo Tian and Zhang Hongyun.
"This kid!" the Water Moon Peak master, Shui ManTian, showed a light smile.
"Sometimes I admire this kid's courage! Who else would dare?" Si Tu Anle's face showed admiration.
Luo Tian and Zhang Hongyun exchanged glances, both showing bitterness. They clearly understood Feng Qianyu well; they knew he was too reckless, fighting with equal-level opponents as if it were a life-or-death gamble. In other words, they might end up dying together.
Luo Tian and Zhang Hongyun had certainly suffered from this before. Especially Luo Tian, during the month he was challenged in Dan殿, Feng Qianyu had been his most headache. You hit him once, he would definitely return a strike; it was an exchange of injuries and lives.
At that time, with Luo Tian's cultivation level, defeating Feng Qianyu wasn't hard. But because of this fighting style, it had been a headache for Luo Tian. They had fought for three hours until Feng Qianyu was exhausted and defeated by Luo Tian's endurance.
Now, Shi Fengyu faced this situation. He knew if he stabbed him, Feng Qianyu would die for sure; of course, his own head would also be smashed by the terrifying staff.
"Fool!" Shi Fengyu gritted his teeth and roared, then suddenly stopped, retreating.
"Don't you want to live?" Shi Fengyu roared.
But the answer was a staff filled with spiritual energy, and Feng Qianyu's form clung like a band-aid.
Shi Fengyu, seeing Feng Qianyu ignored him, showed a grimace and bit his teeth. He grabbed the staff again and met Feng Qianyu's attack.
The thunderous sound of collision echoed again on the arena, and both sides no longer used techniques but fought with spiritual energy and weapons.
Time passed slowly; Shi Fengyu felt very frustrated. He had several chances to kill Feng Qianyu but was forced to withdraw his moves due to Feng Qianyu's reckless fighting style.
"One hour!"
"Two hours!"
After two hours of battle, both the Xuan Yin Sect and Five Elements Sect disciples watched the two still fighting fiercely. They all showed admiration.
After two hours of combat, Shi Fengyu was completely enraged by Feng Qianyu's tactics. He had no choice but to stop worrying and fight with the same reckless style as Feng Qianyu, exchanging injuries for lives.
"Boom..." A fierce collision sound echoed; two disheveled figures separated again.
At this moment, both were blood-red eyes, like two beasts fighting for life and death, their eyes only seeing each other.
Shi Fengyu's head was full of blood, even visible cracks forming on his head, as if a slight touch would cause it to explode.
Feng Qianyu was no better off, his body full of wounds, with ribs visible on his chest.
Chapter 180: Who Else?
Seeing both so fierce, even the Yuan Ling Realm masters felt a sense of admiration. Both had fought this far purely on willpower.
At this moment, everyone held their breath, wanting to see who would subdue the other.
"Master Wei, let's call it a draw," Du Yongchang's face was dark; he hadn't expected Feng Qianyu to be so tenacious, managing to push Shi Fengyu this far. If they continued fighting, no matter who won or lost, it would cause significant damage to the other side. It could even permanently halt their cultivation in the Cultivation Body Realm, which Du Yongchang didn't want to see.
"Fine!" Wei Mingxuan had also seen that both were at their limit and no longer needed to continue.
"Bone-Transforming Realm! I'll personally kill you!" Shi Fengyu panted heavily, his cold eyes looking at Feng Qianyu before collapsing.
"Then see if you have the ability!" Feng Qianyu coldly replied, his eyes rolling.
Both sects' masters had acknowledged it as a draw. Soon after, someone from both sides stepped forward and carried the two away.
Feng Qianyu's two masters, seeing his severe injuries, showed a look of concern. They immediately started treating him; if not treated promptly, it would cause significant harm to Feng Qianyu and possibly hinder his future cultivation.
Luo Tian stepped out from the crowd, looking at Feng Qianyu's injuries. A jade bottle appeared in his hand and was handed to Si Tu Anle and Shui ManTian: "Take it. A few days of sleep should be enough!"
Shui ManTian and Si Tu Anle took Luo Tian's medicine, their faces showing a hint of guilt. During the conflict between the Thick Earth Peak and Dan殿, they had clearly taken a neutral stance, not helping but even somewhat favoring the Thick Earth Peak. Now, Luo Tian had sent them medicine, which made these two old men feel a warm flush.
"I have a good relationship with Feng Qianyu," Luo Tian said calmly and turned back to the remaining few.
At this moment, another black-cloaked disciple from Xuan Yin Sect stood on the arena, still with that contemptuous gaze: "Xuan Yin Sect, Gao Jie! Please teach me!"
With Feng Qianyu and Shi Fengyu's draw, the Five Elements Sect's momentum had grown significantly.
"Five Elements Sect, Qingmu Peak, Zhong Daming! Please teach me!" A young man in a green robe jumped onto the arena and shouted at Gao Jie.
"Die!" Gao Jie spoke coldly, his form vanished.
Zhong Daming was waiting for Gao Jie to speak but only heard the word "die." Gao Jie's form vanished before his eyes.
Knowing something was wrong, Zhong Daming forced out spiritual energy but underestimated Gao Jie's strength. Gao Jie's form instantly appeared behind Zhong Daming, a playful smile on his face as he grabbed Zhong Daming's shoulders.
"Boom..." A mist of blood formed.
Zhong Daming, this Qingmu Peak genius, was torn apart by Gao Jie in front of the stunned crowd. The entire process took less than two breaths.
Bloodshed—The Five Elements Sect disciples were completely stunned, too bloodthirsty. Especially the Qingmu Peak disciples showed disbelief; Shi Fengyu had been cold enough, but this Gao Jie added a layer of cruelty and bloodthirst.
Gao Jie's face was filled with blood, giving him an even more ferocious aura. His eyes flicked slightly, scanning the remaining few before lightly licking his lips and beckoning them with a finger.
"Despicable! The Xuan Yin Sect is too despicable!" After the stunned silence, the next moment, the Five Elements Sect disciples began to curse. Clearly, Zhong Daming hadn't been ready, and Gao Jie had taken the opportunity to attack.
Hearing the disciples' curses, Gao Jie spoke coldly: "Who said we must wait for both sides to be ready before starting the contest? No one said that. For me, anyone on this arena is my enemy!"
The Five Elements Sect disciples were silenced by Gao Jie's words, their faces showing anger. However, Master Wei Mingxuan hadn't discussed any rules with them.
Gao Jie stood proudly there, as if the entire arena was his territory. Anyone daring to enter it would face his merciless hunt.
"Senior Gao, I'll fight you!" However, as Zhong Daming's blood mist just faded, a loud shout echoed again. A disciple from the Golden Light Peak jumped onto the arena.
Gao Jie saw someone step up and showed a bloodthirsty smile, like an emissary from hell.
