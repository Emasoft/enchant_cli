The black soul condensed rapidly, forming Luo Tian's body within the sight of Luotian and others.

"What should we do?" Seeing Qiu Jingming still radiating overwhelming spiritual energy, Fu Xingyue and the others exchanged glances, their minds filled with thoughts of fleeing.

"Let's activate the King's Weapon and break through the rules of the Mortal Realm to escape!" Jin Ziyang spoke softly, his gaze turning toward Fu Xingyue.

"Let's go! We have no chance; only by fighting can we find a way out!" Tu Feiyang also spoke in agreement.

"We can't escape!" Luotian sighed softly, knowing that fleeing before Qiu Jingming was nearly impossible.

"Want to run?" Qiu Jingming's face twisted with ferocity as black mist surged again, instantly surrounding Luotian and others. It transformed into countless black talismans, etched onto the earth of the Mortal Realm.

"Ten Thousand Soul Sealing Heaven!" Qiu Jingming pressed his hands into the void, and a powerful sealing force erupted from the black talismans, spreading across the gray earth.

"The void itself is sealed, and even its rules are bound!" Fu Xingyue's group turned pale, their gazes shifting toward Qiu Jingming.

"Sealing Hand!" After this, Qiu Jingming凝聚ed a massive black hand, slamming it toward Luotian and the others.

"Done!" Fu Xingyue's face paled, then a wild look flashed in his eyes as he gazed at Qiu Jingming.

"I'll block his attack; you find a way to escape!" Fu Xingyue addressed Luotian and Fu Xingyang, signaling them to protect Fu Xingxuan.

"Don't fight recklessly; I'll try!" Luotian spoke softly, stopping Fu Xingyue from using forbidden techniques. He leapt into motion, exiting the range of the Star Moon Divine Spear.

"You?" Seeing Luotian speak, Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingyang, and Fu Xingxuan wore expressions of confusion. They couldn't fathom how Luotian could turn the tide in such a desperate situation.

"Trust me!" Luotian smiled, his eyes filled with confidence as he strode beyond the Star Moon Divine Spear's domain.

"Take this!" Fu Xingxuan wore a worried expression, handing Luotian a talisman crafted by an aspiring king from Fan Jingyu.

"Brother, don't overexert yourself!" Fu Xingyue also extended a feather from the Jinwu clan to Luotian.

"Rest easy; my life is precious. For Star Moon Divine Emperor and the Star Moon Divine Clan, I'd endure any hardship!" Luotian's face was resolute, his voice solemn.

"At this moment, still showing off!" Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang felt a pang in their hearts, watching Luotian's solemn demeanor.

Fu Xingxuan blushed slightly at the mention of "for Star Moon Divine Emperor," her purple eyes deepening with concern.

"Buzz..." As the three pondered, Luotian stepped beyond the Star Moon Divine Spear's domain, his eyes filled with admiration as he gazed at the massive hand already formed in the sky.

"Strength has indeed suffered!" Luotian felt the power of the black hand, his heart sneering.

Chapter 1499: A Single Sigh Shakes the Eons ()

The massive black hand obscured the gray sky, resembling a dark cloud that loomed over Luotian's head.

As Luotian stepped out of the barrier, he didn't hesitate, thrusting his hand to activate the talisman crafted by an aspiring king of the Bird Clan.

His perception of souls was exceptionally sharp; even Qiu Jingming's soul, an aspiring king-level entity, he could clearly sense. After their collision, Qiu Jingming's strength had declined significantly. Though his "Soul Sealing Hand" still radiated heavenly power, its strength had noticeably weakened.

"Boom...!" As Luotian activated the golden talismans, they erupted in a burst of power, colliding with the descending black hand.

The thunderous sound echoed through the heavens, shaking Luotian's ears and causing his face to pale. His body recoiled, crashing against the Star Moon Divine Spear's barrier.

"Who is he? How could someone from the early era possess such a body, able to withstand an aspiring king's power!" Jin Ziyang and the others wore expressions of shock, watching Luotian clinging to the barrier. Their doubts about Luotian began to stir.

Qiu Jingming wore a faint smile, standing high above the sky, looking down at Luotian sliding from the barrier.

"Finally emerged, now I'll grant you a chance: submit to me, surrender your body, and when I leave this Mortal Realm, I'll rule the world. Old man will take you as my disciple and forge an unparalleled body for you!" Qiu Jingming spoke softly, his power as an aspiring king allowing him to sense the changes in this world. Without a Chronos Lord, he had confidence in attaining enlightenment in this era.

"Daydream!" Luotian coldly replied, then waved his hand again, launching the feather from the Jinwu clan.

Golden flames surged skyward, piercing through space, a golden three-legged crow emerging like the sun, roaring toward Qiu Jingming.

"Useless!" Qiu Jingming's face turned serious, his hands forming seals as he pressed down on the golden three-legged crow.

Black soul seals suddenly凝聚ed, radiating supreme power to suppress it. The thunderous sound echoed again, and Luotian's body was sent flying back, colliding with the barrier, his lips bleeding.

"Primordial Magnetic Divine Light!" Luotian showed no surprise, his eyes unusually calm as he pointed his finger. A pure white light detached from the Primordial Magnetic Mountain, sweeping toward Qiu Jingming.

"Still making futile struggles?" Qiu Jingming's voice was dismissive, but his eyes held seriousness. The Primordial Magnetic Divine Light had a powerful suppressing effect on souls. From the nine times it had annihilated his carefully controlled souls, he knew its power was extraordinary.

The light swept across space, distorting it instantly and appearing before Qiu Jingming. Its speed left Qiu Jingming barely reacting.

"If this is your last card, now you can despair!" Qiu Jingming grabbed the Primordial Magnetic Divine Light with his hand.

"Zhi... " White mist rose from Qiu Jingming's hands, his face slightly contorted. However, the powerful Primordial Magnetic Divine Light continued to be eroded.

"One isn't enough; two, three!" Luotian smiled, his hands forming seals as more pure white Primordial Magnetic Divine Lights detached from the Primordial Magnetic Mountain, attacking Qiu Jingming.

In an instant, Qiu Jingming's face changed as he realized Luotian's plan. He dodged the beams of overwhelming power.

But the Primordial Magnetic Divine Lights were too fast; Qiu Jingming dodged one but couldn't escape the rest.

Each beam, imbued with ultimate refining power, swept across Qiu Jingming's body, causing him to finally withstand it. White mist continuously rose from his body.

"Ah..." A pitiful cry echoed through the heavens, Qiu Jingming's soul, after repeated collisions, began to appear translucent. His aura gradually declined, nearing the Chronos Peak. Yet his soul remained far stronger than those of the Chronos Peaks.

"Finally couldn't withstand it?" Luotian watched as only seven Primordial Magnetic Divine Lights remained on the Primordial Magnetic Mountain, his heart aching but his face revealing a smile. A gray soul emerged from Luotian's body, flying toward Qiu Jingming.

"Is this your soul, the Grand Commander?" Tu Feiyang and others wore expressions of shock, staring at the gray soul.

"Powerful!" They had never seen such a powerful soul before, except for Qiu Jingming's. Even the eight Chronos Peak souls they had encountered were not as strong as Luotian's.

"Divine Seal of the Dao!" As they marveled, Luotian's soul appeared before Qiu Jingming's. Without hesitation, he launched a punch.

"Die!" Qiu Jingming roared, showing no fear, and countered with a punch. A black and gray fist collided under the astonished gazes of Tu Feiyang and others.

Soul energy dissipated, both souls recoiled. Luotian's gray face showed a ruthless expression as he retreated, then leapt into the void toward Qiu Jingming.

"Little brat!" If Qiu Jingming had a body, his face would be pale. The collision with Luotian had reduced his aura to the Chronos Peak.

Yet facing Luotian, Qiu Jingming still showed no fear, his confidence in himself unshaken. He watched Luotian charging toward him and leapt into the air, launching another punch.

"Boom... Boom..." The thunderous sound echoed through the heavens as the two clashed in the Mortal Realm, their souls—typically the most vulnerable part of a cultivator—used as if they were bodies, colliding repeatedly.

"Unbelievable, he faced the Chronos Peak souls without fear. How did his soul become so powerful!" Tu Feiyang and Jin Ziyang's eyes showed disbelief as they watched Luotian colliding with Qiu Jingming. Though slightly at a disadvantage, he showed no signs of defeat.

"Unexpectedly, I once promoted the Soul Sealing Art, and now it's against my own disciple!" Qiu Jingming retreated, his body trembling slightly. Black mist凝聚ed, and the wounds from colliding with Luotian healed instantly. His gaze turned to Luotian, filled with admiration.

"Repent, and I'll let you go!" Luotian's eyes deepened, his soul wounds healing rapidly. He knew he was still no match for Qiu Jingming.

"You overestimate yourself. I've been undefeated my whole life; the only defeat was to Duan Tian, that scoundrel!" Qiu Jingming's eyes flashed with madness. Every time he mentioned Duan Tian, his face turned fierce.

"Even if you're from the same era, you'll still be suppressed by Duan Tian's peak! With such a mindset, you'll never attain enlightenment!" Luotian's hands moved swiftly, his gray soul energy surging as he stepped forward to suppress Qiu Jingming.

"Boom... Boom..." The image of a蛮神 (Fierce God) materialized behind Luotian, causing Tu Feiyang's group to change expressions.

"This... this is the Seven Steps of蛮魂!" Seeing the massive figure, Tu Feiyang's face showed disbelief. He hadn't expected Luotian to learn the Seven Steps of蛮魂 so quickly.

"Life-Devouring Curse!" Seeing the Fierce God's image merging with his soul, Qiu Jingming's face turned serious. He knew the decisive moment had arrived.

Numerous black dragons emerged from Qiu Jingming's hands, coiling toward Luotian.

"Buzz..." The black dragons wrapped around the Fierce God's massive form but were blocked outside.

At the same time, a gray foot crashed down, stomping heavily on Qiu Jingming's body, sending him crashing to the ground.

Luotian felt heavy, watching the black dragons coiling around the Fierce God's form. They were constantly contracting, as if ready to penetrate through and coil around his body.

Luotian knew it was no good, so he took the seventh step, a gray foot crashing down with earth-shattering power, crushing Qiu Jingming.

"Destroy him!" Qiu Jingming's eyes flashed with madness, his hands grabbing fiercely as if pulling something. The black dragons suddenly contracted, instantly shattering the Fierce God's form and appearing around Luotian's soul, coiling around it.

"Buzz..." An invisible wave instantly filled Luotian's soul, causing him to feel a strong sense of crisis.

At the moment the black dragons touched Luotian's soul, it froze in place. An irresistible force continuously crushed his soul.

"Ah..." Luotian roared, unsure if it was pain or resistance against the crushing force.

"Boom..." On the other side, a gray foot heavily stomped on Qiu Jingming's soul. The black soul exploded, turning into countless black mist.

"Kid, this is a new technique I've created over the years. You don't know how to break it, do you? Soul battles, I fear no Chronos Lord!" Qiu Jingming's soul凝聚ed again but was weaker than before, definitely down by more than one level.

"What to do!" Fu Xingyue's group wore anxious expressions, watching Luotian shouting into the sky.

"First kill him!" Jin Ziyang looked at Qiu Jingming, whose soul was also extremely weak. His eyes flashed with coldness.

"Kill me? Wait until I fully recover to kill you!" Qiu Jingming's face showed a hint of ferocity, glaring at Luotian. His black soul surged into the depths of the Mortal Realm.

"Alas..." As Qiu Jingming's soul just moved, a long sigh echoed from the depths of the Mortal Realm, causing Qiu Jingming's body to tremble.

Chapter 1500: Duan Tian ()

"Alas..." The long sigh echoed from the depths of the Mortal Realm, causing Qiu Jingming's body to tremble. His black eyes were filled with disbelief.

Though it was just a sigh, Luotian's group felt their minds shake violently, a massive pressure from the depths of the Mortal Realm pushing toward them. They felt an urge to kneel.

"Did the波动 of Star Moon Divine Spear awaken a terrifying presence in the depths of the Mortal Realm?" Fu Xingyue's group wore shock, their gazes turning to the swirling gray mist.

"Duan Tian, you old scoundrel!" Qiu Jingming roared into the sky, his eyes filled with madness as he gazed at the depths of the Mortal Realm.

"Duan Tian's Lord?" Hearing Qiu Jingming's words, Luotian's group felt a shock, their eyes filled with disbelief.

Even Luotian's mind shook; Duan Tian's name was known throughout the world. Even if someone said Duan Tian still lived, many would believe it.

As Luotian's group were speechless, a series of buzzing sounds emerged from the depths of the Mortal Realm, causing Luotian's group to feel dizzy.

Invisible waves surged outward from the sigh, sweeping toward Luotian's group.

"Buzz..." Star Moon Divine Spear emitted a series of stars and moonlight, enveloping Luotian's group. A figure with stars on his head appeared before them.

"Star Moon Divine Clan's King, I didn't expect this sigh to awaken Star Moon Divine Spear!" Tu Feiyang wore an expression of disbelief, gazing at the towering figure in imperial robes.

"Boom... Boom..." Thunderous sounds echoed as a golden hand, spanning the void, pushed forward from the depths of the Mortal Realm toward Qiu Jingming.

The Star Moon Divine Clan's King image seemed to be guided by something, transmitting a battle spirit into Luotian's group.

"Buzz..." The Star Moon Divine Clan's King gave a cold snort, then pointed his finger toward the golden hand.

"This is a clash between the King of the Clan and the Chronos Lord!" Fu Xingyue's group spoke in disbelief, watching them approach each other.

The King of the Clan and the Chronos Lord of Humanity had never met before, but now they were clashing in this manner.

"Ah..." Luotian roared, his soul returning to his body. Using unparalleled blood energy and a powerful soul, he resisted the black talisman chains that were crushing him.

"Boom... Boom..." As Luotian fought, the attacks of these two supreme beings collided under the expectant gazes of Fu Xingyue's group.

"Duan Tian, you old scoundrel! I'll fight with you!" Qiu Jingming looked at the golden hand, his eyes filled with fear. He wanted to flee but felt terror from a single finger behind it.

Two supreme beings, attacking together, the immense pressure caused Qiu Jingming's entire body to tremble.

"Boom..." Under Luotian's group's astonished gaze, Qiu Jingming's powerful soul was annihilated by the single finger and hand.

Qiu Jingming had already been wounded, and now he was crushed between the attacks of two supreme beings. There was no chance of survival.

Power surged, terrifying waves instantly swept toward Luotian's group, making their faces grim.

"Damn it, this old immortal problem is solved, but we'll be killed by our own King!" Fu Xingyang spoke softly, watching the waves of annihilating power that swept the ground toward them.

The Star Moon Divine Clan's King image emitted a cold feeling, standing before Fu Xingyue's group like a mountain. It seemed as if he could withstand even the collapse of heaven, then raised his hand to push against the waves sweeping toward them.

"Boom..." Golden power collided with the Star Moon Clan's King, producing a series of thunderous sounds like divine music.

The Star Moon Divine Clan's King image collapsed under the impact but also blocked the annihilating power.

"Ah..." The winds swept over Luotian's group, causing them to sigh deeply, their eyes filled with admiration.

"A supreme being of the Clan and a Chronos Lord of Humanity, each is an unparalleled power!" Luotian muttered softly, finally witnessing the true clash between a King and a Chronos Lord.

"An entire great power, seventh-generation Soul Sealing Master, Qiu Jingming's soul has fallen!" Fu Xingyue's face was also filled with admiration, then he collected the Star Moon Divine Spear.

"Was that hand from Duan Tian's Lord? Was it a reserve to suppress Qiu Jingming, or is he truly alive?" Fu Xingyue's group felt waves of shock but leaned toward it being Duan Tian's method.

"Buzz..." Luotian flew up, grabbing the Primordial Magnetic Mountain, then smiled at the black soul mountain.

"This large piece of soul summoning stone is enough to support the creation of a Chronos Treasure!" Fu Xingyue's group all had greedy eyes, then looked at each other.

"How to divide it?" Jin Ziyang spoke softly, drawing their heated gazes back.

"Of course, it belongs to the Star Moon Divine Clan! We were the ones who killed those souls; you did nothing!" Fu Xingyang's eyes showed disdain, addressing Jin Ziyang.

"You can't say that; we're a team, so the benefits should be shared!" Tu Feiyang replied, then his gaze swept over Luotian.

"Also, your Grand Commander is no ordinary person; he has a powerful soul and astonishing talent. He just learned the Seven Steps of蛮魂, yet mastered it!" Fan Jingyu's eyes also showed confusion. Luotian's performance in the Mortal Realm was too obvious, not matching that of a Star Moon Guard Grand Commander.

"Indeed! How could he master it so quickly!" The slowest to react, Man Hun, also spoke loudly, his eyes filled with regret.

"In my memory, there's only one person who has a powerful soul capable of resisting Soul Sealing Masters and knows the Seven Steps of蛮魂!" Tu Feiyang's eyes showed disbelief, gazing at Luotian standing there.

"Eventually, they've discovered it!" Luotian sighed inwardly but shook his head lightly.

"Your Highness, what are you saying? I really don't understand!" Luotian wore an innocent expression, addressing Tu Feiyang.

"Yes, Tu Feiyang, what are you saying? He's our Star Moon Divine Clan Grand Commander. Do you have any objections?" Fu Xingyue's face slightly changed, addressing Tu Feiyang.

Some things, admitting them is one result; denying them entirely is another. So Luotian decided to deny it completely, leaving Tu Feiyang's group powerless. If they tore their relationship apart now, the only ones losing out would be Tu Feiyang's group.

Tu Feiyang's group weren't fools; although they were shocked by Luotian's audacity to come into this Mortal Realm, they also knew Luotian's terrifying strength.

"Seeing but not speaking!" Tu Feiyang's group exchanged glances, then nodded slightly. At this moment, they truly were at a disadvantage; Luotian alone could match them all. Plus, there were many unannihilated residual souls behind Luotian, and Fu Xingyue's group clearly stood on Luotian's side.

"If there are no objections to my identity, then you all discuss how to divide this soul summoning stone! I'll give my share directly to the Star Moon Divine Clan!" Luotian nodded slightly, a smile on his face, then gazed at the residual souls behind him.

Two ox-headed souls remained, but their massive bodies continuously emitted gray mist, clearly having suffered heavy damage during the battle against eight peak souls.

"Thank you for your help; now I'll fulfill my promise!"

"For you! Sealing!" Luotian smiled, addressing the remaining residual souls, his voice solemn.

"Roar..." The ten thousand souls roared, as if hearing Luotian's words, they howled toward the sky.

"Cha..." A series of residual souls, including the two massive ox-headed ones, all knelt to the ground. The scene was magnificent, leaving Fu Xingyue's group in shock.

"Soul Sealing Master is truly powerful! Such a scene can only be achieved by Soul Sealing Masters!" Tu Feiyang's eyes showed regret. He had almost obtained the Soul Sealing Master's inheritance but was intercepted by Luotian.

Luotian flew up, his body emitting waves of gray mist. He pointed his finger, continuously drawing in the sky.

A series of gray talismans materialized in his hands, like meteors falling toward each residual soul kneeling on the ground.

"Boom..." The gray talismans touched the ox-headed souls' bodies, and in an instant, they exploded, transforming into residual souls that scattered outward.

"Rebirth..." Luotian waved his hand, a vast rebirth channel appeared, spanning the sky of the Mortal Realm. A series of gray souls flowed through the channel.

"Go! I can only help you this far!" Luotian spoke softly, an invisible wave enveloping each residual soul.

"Thank you!" Each residual soul's eyes gradually cleared, filled with excitement as they rushed toward the vast rebirth channel.

"Buzz..." A powerful suction formed on the rebirth channel, if it were before, these residual souls would have been rejected by the rebirth channel. But now, they had been sealed and awakened their memories, thus having the qualification to enter the rebirth channel.

"Alas..." Luotian watched the endless souls merge into the rebirth channel, sighing deeply. However, he didn't notice a very weak soul that hadn't chosen to enter the rebirth channel but quietly slipped into the ground of the Mortal Realm.

Chapter 1501: Iron Tree ()

The last residual soul merged into the rebirth channel, and the vast rebirth channel disappeared from Luotian's group's sight.

As the massive rebirth channel vanished, the gray mist outside the Mortal Realm suddenly diminished, causing the ancient tribes watching closely to wear expressions of joy.

"Success!"

"Not bad for a clan's prodigy; he solved it!" People murmured, the battle's waves were too great, especially the clash between Star Moon King and Duan Tian's Lord. The power directly swept into the star domain, shaking the ancient tribes.

"What does this rebirth channel lead to?" Luotian's eyes showed confusion. The Rebirth Fist had accompanied him for a long time, but after his strength increased significantly, he hadn't used it again. He had once used the Rebirth Fist to create a rebirth channel, but now his strength was in the late era. His view of the rebirth channel wasn't as simple.

Luotian's eyes were deep, gazing at the void, his mind filled with confusion. He had too many questions.

"Grand Commander, should we continue or return?" Fu Xingyue smiled slightly, appearing before Luotian. Obviously, they had gained a lot in the division.

"I'll continue; you can do as you wish!" Luotian spoke softly, scanning the group's faces. The crisis of the Mortal Realm's souls had been resolved; Qiu Jingming was dead, so their mission was complete. They could leave now.

"Continue!" Tu Feiyang gritted his teeth, although he had obtained the soul summoning stone, it was clearly not enough for his appetite. He also wanted to see what attack Duan Tian's Lord had sent into the depths of the Mortal Realm.

"Continue!" Jin Ziyang, Fan Jingyu, and Man Hun also wore determination. If Luotian obtained any cultivation in the depths of the Mortal Realm, they would be left far behind, forever losing the chance to match Luotian.

"Okay!" Luotian felt a bit speechless, shaking his head slightly before addressing Fu Xingyue's group: "Rest for a while; after resting, we'll continue!"

"Okay!" Hearing Luotian's words, Fu Xingyue's group nodded. Obviously, they knew Luotian's identity now. Fu Xingyue didn't need to hide anything, and they all followed Luotian's orders.

They sat cross-legged, waves of power spreading from their bodies. A series of energy whirlpools entered their bodies, beginning to recover their previous exhaustion.

Time passed slowly; three days slipped by quickly. They all opened their eyes, adjusting to peak condition.

"Let's go!" Luotian looked at their auras and spoke softly. Fu Xingyue collected the Star Moon Divine Spear, fearing another outburst of a King's weapon.

They walked again along the gray road toward the depths of the Mortal Realm, their eyes more solemn. After two encounters, they had faced life-threatening crises. If not for Luotian being a Soul Sealing Master, they might have expended much energy facing those residual souls.

As they continued deeper, the scenery changed; it was no longer thick with gray mist but gradually had a sense of grass and trees.

"What's going on?" Luotian's group didn't let their guard down but felt a sense of tension. In the Mortal Realm, such changes were clearly abnormal.

Time passed slowly; the scent of grass and trees became more intense, through the gray mist, they even saw tree shadows, leaving them puzzled.

After walking several miles, their faces finally changed; a dense forest appeared in Luotian's group's sight. They looked at the forest with disbelief, never expecting the Mortal Realm to have such a dense forest.

The forest was filled with thick grass, covering their feet, obviously untouched for a long time.

"What place is this?" Fu Xingyue's eyes showed confusion, speaking softly as he gazed into the forest's depths. However, his spiritual sense couldn't probe beyond it, so he relied on sight.

Luotian's group also probed their spiritual senses but found no clues, sighing lightly.

"This tree is strange!" Tu Feiyang's eyes showed confusion as he raised a blood light, slashing toward a nearby tree.

"Shi..." The bloodlight flashed but didn't cut the tree in half as expected; instead, it emitted sparks. Luotian's group's faces slightly changed.

Tu Feiyang was in the late era, and if he wanted to, he could destroy a star.

"This is ironwood!" Fu Xingyue's face showed shock, looking at the tree with a mark and speaking out.

"Everything has spirit; if a tree grows to a certain level, it will have self-defense capabilities. It's said that if an ordinary tree survives for a thousand years, it will evolve into ironwood, extremely strong!" Fu Xingyue spoke softly, then his eyes showed excitement.

"The conditions for ironwood formation are extremely harsh; unless there's a miraculous cultivation, it's hard to become ironwood. But with so many ironwoods here, there must be a miraculous cultivation that allowed them to grow for so long!" Fan Jingyu spoke softly, his eyes also showing excitement.

"Longevity Land, Immortal Medicine!" Luotian's group spoke slowly, exchanging glances before moving in different directions.

They all had默契 (mutual understanding), knowing they couldn't compete with Luotian's group. If they searched separately, the chances of success would be higher.

Immortal Medicine is something even aspiring kings envy. It has the secret to prolong life and let Chronos Lords live into the next era.

Although the Four Sacred Star Domains had a Purple Sky Divine Lotus, this thing was obviously better with more. Who would refuse to have treasures?

As for Jiang Nanxuan, Luotian never wanted him to waste Tian Huan Divine Demon Flowers. After all, it caused great harm to Jiang Nanxuan. When Jiang Nanxuan used several petals of the Tian Huan Divine Demon Flowers, it took years to recover. If not for that, Jiang Nanxuan would be even more terrifying now.

Luotian didn't join Fu Xingyue's group either, as they didn't want to let Tu Feiyang's group get there first.

"Where is it?" Luotian's eyes flashed with purple light, his vision reaching nearly a hundred feet, but still nothing was found.

They searched through the vast forest, all wanting to find the Immortal Medicine before others.

"Stop running!" As Luotian flew, a loud shout echoed in his ears, causing his face to slightly change. He flew toward the sound's source.

"I really have astonishing luck!" Tu Feiyang wore a mad expression, his body transforming into a bloodlight. His eyes were filled with heat, gazing at a little boy who looked like he was only several years old.

Though it was a little boy, his speed wasn't slow at all, and he radiated an astonishing aura. His face showed fear.

"Don't run anymore! If you keep running, I'll have Xiao Liu and Er Dan beat you!" The little boy shouted while running, his voice clear.

"Surely it's the Immortal Medicine that has taken human form! It must be mine!" Tu Feiyang's breath was slightly hurried. His body kept moving, ignoring the little boy's words. He had only one thought: if he caught this little boy, he would gain a miraculous cultivation!

However, Tu Feiyang didn't dare to use martial arts or shout loudly, fearing that Luotian's group would find out. He also didn't want to harm the Immortal Medicine in the form of a little boy, as it was all essence.

"Xiao Liu, Er Dan, fight him!" The little boy, apparently desperate, shouted loudly.

"Where is someone?" Tu Feiyang's face showed confidence, his body expanding again, increasing his speed to the maximum.

"Crash..." But in an instant, the towering ironwood trees emitted a series of sounds. Thick branches seemed alive, sweeping toward Tu Feiyang.

"Crack..." Tu Feiyang's speed was too fast, but he hadn't expected such a sudden emergence of tree trunks blocking his path. His entire body crashed into the trunk.

The thick trunk was shattered by Tu Feiyang, but his forehead also formed a big bump. His entire body fell to the ground, dizzy and disoriented.

It wasn't that Tu Feiyang was injured by the trunk; it was just that he hadn't expected a ancient tree to suddenly appear, and he didn't take it seriously.

As Tu Feiyang fell to the ground, the little boy transformed into a green light and vanished from his sight.

"Let me catch you, I'll plant you in the latrine!" Tu Feiyang's body surged into the sky, his entire being furious.

"Blood Escape!" Tu Feiyang spat out a mouthful of blood, his speed increasing again. He sliced through the sky, ignoring others. If he didn't fight desperately, he would regret it forever.

However, as Tu Feiyang just took off, a voice filled with laughter echoed in his ears.

"Tu Xiong, you're so refined; what martial arts are you practicing here? Iron Head?" A figure appeared like a ghost, instantly catching up to Tu Feiyang's Blood Escape.

"Luotian!" Hearing this voice, Tu Feiyang's heart was hit hard. His face showed madness and a bad feeling, thinking about his astonishing luck; whenever he met Luotian, it felt like he had a rival.

"I..." Tu Feiyang wanted to cry, especially after colliding with the ironwood tree. It felt like just the beginning, and his unease deepened.

Luotian's eyes flashed with electricity, watching the little boy disappear. He moved quickly past Tu Feiyang and vanished from his sight.

Chapter 1502: The Tree of Life and Soul ()
