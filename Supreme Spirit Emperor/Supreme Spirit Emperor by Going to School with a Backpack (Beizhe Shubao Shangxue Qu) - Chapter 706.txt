As he spoke, Luo Tian had already stepped beyond ten thousand zhang from the Huanmo Hall. His eyes flashed with divine light, and he strode into the hall.

As Luo Tian entered, a surge of demonic energy erupted around him. The surrounding scenery shifted dramatically.

Luo Tian channeled his cultivation into his eyes, and the scene returned to normal—two beacons of light in the darkness.

"Unshaken by illusions?" Yang Huanyu's eyes gleamed with admiration. He waved his hand, and a cascade of seal characters erupted from his palm, swirling toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 2654: Stalemate

The sky was swathed in seal characters, enveloping Luo Tian as they surged toward him. A mysterious force instantly bonded to his body, and he felt the scenery twist again.

Luo Tian's eyes blazed gold, as if lightning flickered within them. The seal characters shattered around him, but his speed had noticeably slowed.

"Old demon! Won't you come out?" As he spoke, Luo Tian bellowed, his voice thunderous. Yin Wu was momentarily stunned.

"Indeed a genius!" As Luo Tian's words faded, a figure materialized beside him. A green eye glowed with eerie light in the center of his forehead.

"Old demon, let's team up again?" Luo Tian smiled. From the start, he never believed the old demon would leave.

After all, the Huanmo Hall's temptation was immense. More importantly, Yang Huanyu would never let the old demon escape.

"Good!" The old demon nodded without embarrassment at Luo Tian's revelation. Together with Luo Tian, they strode toward Yang Huanyu. The seal characters above them continuously shattered.

Ten zhang... a hundred zhang...

In an instant, their speed increased. The number of seal characters before them multiplied. Luo Tian and the old demon reached a hundred zhang beyond the Huanmo Hall.

"Liang Huan Yu! Let's fight!" Luo Tian waved his Rip Heaven Spear, its tip pointing at Yang Huan Yu standing atop the Huanmo Hall.

"Now? Not yet. I have greater matters!" Yang Huan Yu chuckled, his hands moving swiftly. A green ancient coffin materialized in the sky, descending to crush Luo Tian and the old demon.

Boom...

The ancient coffin shattered space. It seemed to contain an unparalleled figure, radiating overwhelming pressure that made the old demon's face twitch slightly.

Divine Burial. Luo Tian was familiar with this technique, so he wasn't surprised when Yang Huan Yu unleashed it. He raised his spear to pierce the coffin.

The old demon's eyes glowed with green light. He extended a finger, pressing it toward the coffin.

In an instant, collision sounds echoed through the heavens. The green coffin clashed with Luo Tian's attack, sending them both staggering back several steps.

"This person... how strong!" Yin Wu stood a万里 away, watching the confrontation. One strike alone left him awestruck.

Luo Tian's strength was somewhat known to Yin Wu. He was undefeated among his peers, capable of battling the five Grand Disciples. The old demon's strength needed no explanation.

Together, they were top-tier Mid-Immortal Kings—perhaps even the strongest. Yet they had been repelled by the man standing atop the Huanmo Hall.

As they steadied themselves, Luo Tian and the old demon continued toward Yang Huan Yu. Luo Tian extended his hand, summoning a black vortex above Yang Huan Yu's head. A massive ghostly claw descended.

Yang Huan Yu furrowed his brow, raising one hand. A green coffin materialized again, enveloping him.

The black ghostly claw shattered against the coffin. Yang Huan Yu's figure vanished from Luo Tian and the old demon's sight.

Yet the green coffin showed no signs of disturbance. Black seal characters cascaded from the Huanmo Hall, wrapping around it.

"Damn!" Luo Tian's face darkened. He dared not step onto the Huanmo Hall, but the situation remained tense.

The coffin encircled by black demonic seals was exceptionally sturdy. To attack Yang Huan Yu, they must first shatter this coffin.

Rip Heaven Spear!

Eternal Blue Sky!

Luo Tian and the old demon roared, leaping into the sky. They unleashed powerful attacks toward the coffin.

Boom... Boom...

The thunderous echoes resounded through the hall. As Yang Huan Yu executed Divine Burial, the illusion vanished. Yin Wu joined Luo Tian and the old demon's assault.

"Stop hiding! Show your strongest attack!" Luo Tian spoke, drawing his Broken Sword of the Divine. His gaze locked onto the green coffin.

They had attacked dozens of times, but only managed to crack a few seal characters. At this rate, they'd need an hour to break it.

"Who is this person? How strong!" The old demon's thoughts were awestruck. His power surged again.

Yin Wu bellowed, his body evolving divine laws. Complex tortoise shells gradually covered him.

Luo Tian stomped the ground, brandishing his Divine Sword. He unleashed waves of sword energy, executing the Divine Sword Array.

"Go!" The old demon pressed his hands to his temples. His forehead veins bulged as he shot a green light.

A world-destroying aura spread, the green divine light making Luo Tian and Yin Wu feel imminent danger. It collided with the green coffin.

The thunderous sound shook eight directions. The green coffin was pierced by the green light, cracks forming across its surface.

A downpour of sword energy descended like rain. Each wave carried terrifying sword intent, striking the green coffin.

Storms raged as heaven and earth roared. Yin Wu bellowed, manifesting a divine law armor. He stomped the ground, charging toward the green coffin with all his might.

Boom...

Under their combined attacks, the green ancient coffin finally shattered. It exploded into divine fragments, scattering before their eyes.

"It's broken!" Luo Tian stared intently at the Huanmo Hall, seeing the figure standing amidst the storm.

"Go down!" A cold voice echoed. A black hand swept across, striking Yin Wu who had shattered the coffin and was exhausted.

Like swatting a fly, Yin Wu transformed into a streak of light, flying back toward Luo Tian and the old demon. Blood trailed through the air.

Cough... Cough...

Yin Wu coughed blood, his back turned crimson. His gaze was weak as he looked at Luo Tian.

"I should have known I wouldn't refine this martial art!" Yin Wu smiled bitterly, trembling as he stood. He took the elixir Luo Tian had given him without any courtesy.

"Unexpected," Yang Huan Yu stood atop the black demonic hall, gazing at Luo Tian. He wiped blood from his lips.

"He's injured!" The old demon sighed softly, surprised that their fierce attacks had only wounded him slightly.

"Enough. Let the boy stay; you may leave," Yang Huan Yu addressed Luo Tian, clearly intending to let him go.

"Impossible!" Luo Tian shook his head. He couldn't abandon Yin Wu; otherwise, Wuxue Hall would immediately turn on him.

"Then I'll have to deal with you both!" Yang Huan Yu nodded, taking a step forward. He descended from the Huanmo Hall.

Chapter 2655: Battle Against Yang Huan Yu

Yang Huan Yu's face was calm, as if his injuries had never existed. He gazed at Luo Tian and the old demon.

"Old fool, I'll give you one last chance. Join me, and you can live long," Yang Huan Yu addressed the old demon.

"You're nothing! I've lived a million years. I'm the one who's lived longest since ancient times. Even Guigu Zi, I've fought against him—though I lost, you're no match to subdue me."

"I've sought the path of immortality. You, a young upstart, dare to subdue me?" The old demon's eyes showed disdain.

"An ancient power who fought against Guigu Zi!" Luo Tian was stunned. No wonder Luo Li called him the old demon.

"Ten thousand years is the limit of Immortal Realm?" Luo Tian sighed. No wonder Immortals sought entry into the Three Thousand Small Realms—there one could live longer.

"I have no qualifications? If it were the ancient times, you wouldn't even deserve to tie my shoes!" Yang Huan Yu sneered, gazing at the old demon.

Yang Huan Yu flipped his hand. A black token appeared in his palm, emitting an ancient aura. It bore the character "Life" (Sheng), radiating divine laws.

"What is this?" Seeing Yang Huan Yu's token, the old demon's body trembled slightly.

"Luoshengmen? This is the Luosheng Token!" The old demon exclaimed, his eyes filled with disbelief.

"Luosheng Token?" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed. He sensed the old demon was moved, his gaze cautious.

"What does this token represent? Though Luoshengmen isn't as strong as in ancient times, it's still beyond your reach!"

"Immortality? You live long. Do Jing Wu Ye and Nie Tianxing live longer?" Yang Huan Yu spoke softly.

"Who are you!" The old demon's eyes showed disbelief, gazing at Yang Huan Yu.

"Master of Luoshengmen, the second-generation master!" Yang Huan Yu seemed impatient.

"Three seconds to decide. If you don't submit, you die!" Yang Huan Yu spoke softly.

"If this Luosheng Token can be given to me, I'll submit!" The old demon wavered slightly, his gaze greedy as he looked at the token in Yang Huan Yu's hand.

"What use does this token have? Even the old demon is moved by it!" Luo Tian was shocked, sensing Yang Huan Yu had many secrets.

"Luoshengmen has pursued immortality through generations. The Luosheng Token records research on immortality by past masters, including the first master," Yin Wu spoke, reminding Luo Tian.

"Ah!" Luo Tian muttered, understanding the old demon would definitely betray. For someone whose lifespan was nearing its end, this token was fatal.

"Fine. No big deal. But you need to show your loyalty first. Don't rush; after I deal with him, we'll talk!" Yang Huan Yu smiled, waving his hand. The black token transformed into a streak of light, landing before the old demon.

The old demon's face was excited. He reached for the black token, his gaze toward Luo Tian, distancing himself slightly.

"Explosion!" But as the old demon grasped the token, Yang Huan Yu softly uttered a word.

Buzz...

The black token emitted dark light. A wave of destruction surged out, a thunderous explosion echoing through the hall.

"Bad!" Luo Tian's face darkened. He instantly activated his domain, grabbing Yin Wu and flying to a corner of the hall.

A wave capable of annihilating everything surged out, turning ten thousand zhang into a forbidden zone. Space continuously collapsed.

Luo Tian and Yin Wu stood within Luo Tian's barrier, clearly seeing the old demon's face contorted. His body was annihilated by the wave, his soul scattered.

"What power is this?" Yin Wu's mind trembled, watching the wave冲击 Luo Tian's barrier.

After several tens of seconds, calm returned. The hall seemed unchanged, but the old demon was completely erased, leaving nothing behind.

"Alright, now it's just us! A trash who doesn't deserve to negotiate with me!" Yang Huan Yu addressed Luo Tian, voice calm.

"You're still as ruthless as ever," Luo Tian sighed. He had guessed the old demon would fall for it, but hadn't expected Yang Huan Yu to kill him outright.

"He was no longer useful. A withered old body!" Yang Huan Yu replied.

Yang Huan Yu's words made Yin Wu cold. His meaning was clear—Yin Wu still had some value.

"Come on!" Luo Tian held his Rip Heaven Spear, gazing at Yang Huan Yu with battle intent. Though he had no confidence, he wouldn't lose.

A black war halberd appeared in Yang Huan Yu's hand, emitting a cold glow. As the Netherworld War Halberd appeared, the Rip Heaven Spear and Netherworld War Halberd both radiated battle intent.

At the same time, Luo Tian and Yang Huan Yu moved. They stomped the ground, rushing toward each other. In an instant, they were before each other.

Crack...

A thunderous sound echoed. The black Rip Heaven Spear and Netherworld War Halberd collided. After years, the two war weapons faced each other again.

Excitement echoed through the hall, as if two old enemies. The two war weapons trembled violently in Luo Tian and Yang Huan Yu's hands.

After the collision, both Luo Tian and Yang Huan Yu staggered back. They gazed at each other, their hands gripping the weapons trembling slightly.

They both struck again simultaneously, choosing close combat. The Rip Heaven Spear and Netherworld War Halberd continuously clashed.

Yin Wu watched their battle, his eyes filled with awe. Though they seemed no danger, Yin Wu felt that if either fell out of rhythm, they would suffer heavy injuries.

"Too strong. Even with my secret techniques, fighting them in close combat wouldn't guarantee victory!" Yin Wu's eyes showed bitterness. He felt the gap between himself and Luo Tian was too great.

"This era belongs to them!" Yin Wu felt a sense of defeat, stronger than when he was defeated by Luo Tian in the Wheel Rotation Hall.

As Yin Wu felt bitter, Luo Tian and Yang Huan Yu pulled apart. As if prearranged, both raised their hands, hand seals flying.

In an instant, a great seal and a ghostly claw collided above their heads. A wild wave of power rained down. Luo Tian and Yang Huan Yu vanished from their original positions.

Rip Heaven Spear!

Luo Tian and Yang Huan Yu appeared in the sky. Luo Tian bellowed, thrusting his spear toward Yang Huan Yu.

"Halberd of the Netherworld!" Yang Huan Yu sighed, slamming his halberd toward Luo Tian. He clearly intended to exchange blows.

Chapter 2656: Defeat

"Exchange!" Luo Tian's eyes showed cruelty. He had never feared anyone exchanging blows.

Luo Tian and Yang Huan Yu both moved their bodies, avoiding vital points. Their attacks landed on each other.

The Rip Heaven Spear pierced Yang Huan Yu's shoulder, and the Netherworld War Halberd smashed Luo Tian's shoulder. Both staggered back.

Luo Tian's face was grim. His left arm had lost sensation. Yang Huan Yu's arm had a blood hole, with continuous bleeding.

Both struck again. Luo Tian planted his spear into the ground. Yang Huan Yu did the same. They moved their bodies, both throwing punches.

Buzz... Buzz...

Space trembled. Eight fists merged, each with six whirlpools. Six cycles of轮回配合乱披风 struck, a powerful fist aura making Yang Huan Yu's face finally show concern.

Mysterious power was added to Yang Huan Yu's fist. Nine gray seal characters dragons coiled around his arm, radiating terrifying energy.

Crack...

The two fists collided. Thunder rained from their collision. A wild wave surged out.

Time seemed to freeze. Luo Tian and Yang Huan Yu stood there, fists colliding, their two forces continuously pushing against each other.

Luo Tian's lips bled. His eyes showed disbelief, gazing at Yang Huan Yu near him.

Though Luo Tian had prepared for Yang Huan Yu's strength, he hadn't expected him to be this strong.

Eight times physical strength, plus six cycles of轮回. Luo Tian was confident this punch could destroy a Mid-Immortal King. Even ten Grand Disciples would suffer heavy injuries from his full power attack.

But Yang Huan Yu had blocked it. He seemed to be injured less than Luo Tian, not even a drop of blood.

"You're still not strong enough!" Yang Huan Yu lightly shook his head, gazing at his arm. Seven of the nine seal character dragons had shattered, with two still swirling.

"Nine times!" Luo Tian's eyes showed resentment. He roared, retreating to regroup. His cultivation rushed into his numb right arm, trying to break through his limits.

With a roar, Luo Tian's entire right arm began to show cracks. Blood flowed, staining his arm red. A explosive power surged from his right arm.

Luo Tian stomped the ground, rushing toward Yang Huan Yu again. A crackling sound echoed around him.

"I said you're still not strong enough!" Yang Huan Yu's eyes flickered slightly. His mouth curled into a strange smile, striking another punch that collided with Luo Tian's.

Thunder rang again. Luo Tian felt as if he had struck an iron plate, his body involuntarily flying back, spitting blood.

Yang Huan Yu also retreated repeatedly. The seal character dragons on his arm all shattered, with blood oozing from his mouth.

"How is this possible!" Luo Tian's arm trembled. He couldn't help but exclaim, gazing at Yang Huan Yu standing there.

Because of the nine times physical strength, Luo Tian's right arm had lost sensation. Though it was recovering, it definitely wouldn't recover in a short time.

Yang Huan Yu shook his fist. He gazed at Luo Tian, then stomped the ground again, appearing before Luo Tian.

Luo Tian didn't dare to be careless. He retreated, but the hall was only this big. Where could he retreat?

In an instant, Luo Tian was forced into the hall's corner by Yang Huan Yu. A punch after another struck Luo Tian.

Rain-like fist shadows surrounded Luo Tian. He felt all his bones shattered, being smashed into the hall's wall.

Blood stained the wall behind Luo Tian. He slowly slid down, his gaze filled with bitterness.

Defeat. It had been a long time since Luo Tian felt the taste of failure. He had thought he could fight Yang Huan Yu, though without confidence, it was a fifty-fifty chance.

But this situation was far worse than he had imagined. He couldn't understand how Yang Huan Yu had grown to this level.

"Are you curious why I'm so strong?" Yang Huan Yu didn't attack. Instead, his eyes showed a smile as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"Our paths are different!"

"I said, out of respect for the past, I won't kill you today. Moreover, I want to see what path you take, and where it leads!" Yang Huan Yu's gaze carried a sigh. He spoke words Luo Tian didn't understand.

"I don't believe it!" Luo Tian roared, his injuries rapidly recovering. He suddenly stood up, gazing at Yang Huan Yu.

The Broken Sword of the Divine appeared before Luo Tian. He raised his blood-stained hand, grasping the sword's hilt. Blood instantly stained the ancient sword.

"Now it seems my path is stronger!" Yang Huan Yu lightly shook his head. He extended his hand, and the Netherworld War Halberd flew from the ground into his grasp.

Divine Sword of Heaven!

Slaying the World with a Blade!

Luo Tian roared, channeling all his cultivation into the Divine Sword. His face was pale as he launched two brilliant sword beams toward Yang Huan Yu.

Yang Huan Yu's gaze was calm. His Netherworld War Halberd radiated divine light, striking the first sword beam heading toward him.

At the same time, Yang Huan Yu's hands moved swiftly. He manifested myriad techniques. Black qi surged from his body,沉浮 (floating), and a black demonic palace descended to crush everything. It was none other than the Huanmo Hall.

Collision sounds echoed. Divine Sword of Heaven was shattered by a halberd, while Slaying the World with a Blade was directly crushed by the black demonic palace. The deafening sound made Luo Tian and Yin Wu's heads ring.

Cough... Cough...

Luo Tian's lips bled. He gazed at the descending black demonic palace, raising his hands to meet it.

In an instant, Luo Tian's body trembled violently. His legs continuously bent, as if he were lifting the black demonic palace.

"Is this person a monster? Even Luo Tian is so helpless!" Yin Wu watched Yang Huan Yu, surprised that Luo Tian had been defeated this way.

Boom... Boom...

The black demonic palace finally disappeared above Luo Tian's head. However, Luo Tian seemed to have lost all strength. He leaned on the Rip Heaven Spear that had returned to him, gazing at Yang Huan Yu.

"I'll take him!" Yang Huan Yu's gaze fell on Yin Wu, making his heart skip a beat.

At this moment, Luo Tian was heavily injured and seemed to have no more fighting strength. He had also used secret techniques, temporarily lacking energy.

"Which older brother will save me? I don't want to be possessed!" Yin Wu mentally cried. He knew his fate if he was captured would be extremely tragic.

Chapter 2657: Huangqian Realm

Yang Huan Yu stood there, like a supreme emperor. He strode toward Yin Wu, making him feel despair.

"you can't take him!" But as Yang Huan Yu walked, a cold voice echoed. Divine light flashed, making Yang Huan Yu stop.

A golden copper mirror stood before Luo Tian. It had a black crystal embedded in it, radiating waves that made Yang Huan Yu frown slightly.

"This thing can't harm me!" Yang Huan Yu addressed Luo Tian, still walking toward Yin Wu.

"You can try!" However, a powerful wave emanated from the mirror, making Yang Huan Yu stop again.

Yang Huan Yu gazed at Luo Tian. They stared at each other, and finally Yang Huan Yu sneered: "Fine. If that's the case, I'll give you face, since we are old acquaintances!"

Yang Huan Yu stopped his steps. He turned toward the Huanmo Hall, stepping into it. His body stood beneath the black hall. He raised his hand, and the black hall slowly shrank, being absorbed by Yang Huan Yu.

"Alright. I have other matters. I won't chat with you here!"

"Don't continue walking. If we meet again, I truly won't hold back!" Yang Huan Yu's figure vanished. His voice echoed through the hall.

Hu...

Luo Tian and Yin Wu sat there, faces showing smiles.

"I thought you were变态 (abnormal), but someone is even more abnormal!" Yin Wu panted, gazing at the hall's exit.

"Who says not?" Luo Tian smiled bitterly. This defeat had stirred a sense of failure in him.

For years, the only person who could suppress Luo Tian was Yang Huan Yu. It had been so in the Tianyuan Continent, and still so in Hell. Luo Tian seemed to have never truly won.

"How much of his strength did he use?" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He knew Yang Huan Yu hadn't used his full strength.

Luo Tian had used all his power. He was about to use the孽障镜 (Evil Mirror) and纪元之书 (Epoch Book). Obviously, Yang Huan Yu's strength couldn't be described as Mid-Immortal King.

Just the Huanmo Hall was beyond Luo Tian's current ability. Though he was certain Yang Huan Yu hadn't fully unleashed the hall's power, it was still a formidable challenge for Luo Tian.

"Burned one drop of essence blood, and still lost!" Luo Tian sighed longingly. If he hadn't burned one drop of essence blood to recover most of his injuries, he would have been even worse.

"First, recover your injuries!" Luo Tian addressed Yin Wu. He gazed at the hall's exit, pondering whether to continue deeper. Alone with Yin Wu, it seemed they truly couldn't fight Yang Huan Yu.

"Is Luoshengmen's main base in Huangqian's tomb?"

"Why did he come here?" Luo Tian was filled with questions.

Yin Wu also sighed, but felt fortunate to have come in with Luo Tian. Otherwise, his fate would definitely be tragic.

"Luo Xiong (Brother Luo), go out. I'll go contact the Grand Master, letting him come. Here isn't a place we can fight against, whether it's Huangqian Tomb or Luoshengmen. We two can't face them," Yin Wu addressed Luo Tian.

"Luo Xiong, don't worry. My promise still holds. Because you saved my life this time, I'll help you!" Yin Wu spoke. As for the sense of defeat, Yin Wu was the biggest. He felt that compared to Luo Tian and Yang Huan Yu, he was truly ordinary.

Luo Tian had no desire to talk with Yin Wu. They sat in the hall, recovering their injuries.

Time passed slowly. After three days of recovery with elixirs, both Luo Tian and Yin Wu had fully recovered.

"Let's go!" Yin Wu spoke. He needed to leave quickly to inform Wuxue Hall.

"Don't be foolish. We definitely can't go out now. Not until his plan is complete, we won't be allowed to report back!" Luo Tian shook his head.

"Boom..." As he spoke, Yin Wu rushed upward but was repelled by a barrier.

"Damn!" Yin Wu gritted his teeth. This feeling of being controlled was truly uncomfortable.

"Now we have two choices before us: stay in the hall or continue forward!" Luo Tian spoke, gazing at the hall's exit.

"Stay in the hall. Based on my understanding of him, he won't attack us. If we continue, he'll definitely kill us!" Luo Tian spoke again, gazing at Yin Wu. Actually, Luo Tian had already made his decision.

"Luo Xiong, what do you think?" Yin Wu at this moment had no backbone, no ideas.

"I'll go out of the hall. You can stay here!" Luo Tian replied, stepping toward the hall's exit.

Yin Wu watched Luo Tian leave. Finally, he bit his teeth and followed behind Luo Tian.

Soon, the two reached the hall's door. The outside was all black; they couldn't see the scenery beyond.

Luo Tian and Yin Wu both stepped forward, exiting the hall's door. A wave instantly swept over Luo Tian.

Luo Tian felt the surrounding scenery twisted. In an instant, the scenery around him changed.

Ugh...

Luo Tian heard calls in his ears. His eyes showed caution, gazing around.

The sky was dim, with ghostly qi swirling. It seemed endless天地 (heavens and earth) had countless gray qi drifting.

"Souls!" Luo Tian was slightly stunned. He hadn't expected to encounter souls.

Yin Wu's figure also disappeared. The entire world only had Luo Tian and the seemingly endless souls.

"At least this place is safe. What is this place?" Luo Tian shook his body, emitting the aura of a Soul Master. The souls that wanted to attack him froze in place.

"What is this place?" Luo Tian asked, gazing at the souls. The most knowledgeable about this place were these souls.

"This is Huangqian Realm, created by the Yellow Spring Lord!" A soul transmitted a thought to Luo Tian.

"Huangqian Realm?" Luo Tian was stunned. He felt the rules of this world, and the souls transmitted information into his mind.

Luo Tian understood. This was an incomplete small world, built by Huangqian. He also felt that the rules of this small world weren't complete. Huangqian hadn't finished building this small world, and for some reason, he had perished. Before dying, Huangqian found this tomb, burying himself and everything in it. The souls in this small world were originally people who had died, but due to the rules, they remained here.

Chapter 2658: Ghost Vein

As Luo Tian listened to the souls' descriptions, his eyes grew brighter. This Huangqian Realm was completely his domain. Here, billions of souls would obey his commands. And everything in this Huangqian Realm would surely belong to him.

"Good fortune!" Luo Tian couldn't help but speak. His gaze fell on the souls surrounding him.

"Where is the treasure?" Luo Tian asked, and the surrounding souls immediately trembled. They emitted roaring sounds, guiding him in directions.

Luo Tian followed the souls and quickly reached a small mountain. On top of it was a black long sword.

"Ah, good. A middle-grade divine weapon!" Luo Tian didn't hesitate and collected the sword.

"Next place!" Luo Tian spoke, like a bandit, plundering everything in this Huangqian Realm.

Happiness...

Overall, Luo Tian was just one word. He had forgotten about his previous defeat against Yang Huan Yu because this small world came from the ancient times. Due to the incomplete rules of the small world, many things had turned to dust. What remained were excellent treasures.

Luo Tian didn't want to waste any time. Though the souls guided him, he also activated his Golden Wheel Thunder Sun Eye, inspecting every ground. He wouldn't miss anything.

Moreover, Luo Tian had walked for a day in this small world and hadn't found anyone. He only saw many skeletons.

That day, a vast mountain range appeared in Luo Tian's view. Black mist surrounded it. He could clearly feel the souls around this mountain were much stronger than those he had encountered before. He even sensed several King Souls.

"This place definitely has good treasures!" Luo Tian spoke softly. As he did, a series of growls echoed from the forest. Several gray figures rushed out and landed near Luo Tian.

"Who are you? How did you enter here?" The gray figures' bodies radiated powerful energy. Their gray eyes regarded Luo Tian with suspicion.

"Ah, these are King-level souls. And they're self-cultivated!" Luo Tian sighed softly.

"Everyone has come out?"

"Is there anyone else? This place belongs to me from now on!" Luo Tian bellowed, emitting a presence.

"Mid-Immortal King. How dare you speak so boldly!" One of the gray figures spoke, their voice carrying disdain.

"Kill him!" Before they finished speaking, several King-level souls rushed toward Luo Tian.

"You're all coming down too!" Facing several early-Immortal King souls, Luo Tian showed no concern. He raised his hand, applying immense pressure against the soul.

Boom... Boom...

Dust surged. Several substantial souls were instantly crushed, their gray eyes showing fear as they gazed at Luo Tian.

"Who... who are you!" Feeling the irresistible sensation, several souls trembled.

"Tell me. What good treasures are in there?" Luo Tian crossed his arms, gazing at the souls.

"Inside is a ghost vein..." One soul spoke honestly, looking at Luo Tian pitifully. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to be so strong, not even using his hands.

"Ghost vein!" Luo Tian's eyes widened. His heart involuntarily contracted.

"My goodness, good fortune!" Luo Tian mentally shouted. His mind was filled with divine crystals!

"This time, my family really has a mine. Several mines!" Luo Tian muttered, wiping his mouth's saliva. His gaze fell on the souls.

At this moment, Luo Tian also understood why these souls had reached King-level. It was definitely related to the ghost vein.

Ghost Vein. Including Hell, it could be counted in the仙界 (Immortal Realm). The nine divine mountains of the Immortal Realm, and the ten palaces of Hell's Yama, these forces relied on their strong foundations to possess such things. However, Hell called it ghost vein while the Immortal Realm called it divine vein. These two things were essentially the same.

"My luck is truly astonishing!" Luo Tian mentally shouted, making the souls feel a bad premonition.

They had cultivated to King-level souls. Their intelligence was certainly not low, but their mindset remained stuck in the ancient times—might is right.

"These souls are good treasures. They've survived since the ancient times, so they must know some ancient secrets!" Luo Tian's thoughts stirred. He gazed at the souls.

"From now on, you'll follow me. I'll take you out and give you a body!" Luo Tian addressed the souls.

"Out?" Hearing Luo Tian's words, the souls trembled. Their gray eyes gazed at Luo Tian.

"Master, you can't go out. Others who entered before also died here!" One soul spoke, his gaze filled with sorrow.

They had been here for countless years. At King-level, they could have gone out. Even in Hell or the Immortal Realm, they could survive. But they had never left.

Hearing the soul's words, Luo Tian's face slightly changed. He suddenly realized that a small world alone could allow them to break the rules and go out.

"Because this small world's rules are incomplete, you can't leave!" One soul spoke, his gray face bitter.
