“Hum…” As Luo Tian extended his finger, the sky immediately transformed into a tempest of swirling energy. The whirlpools coalesced and surged into the Splitting Heaven Spear.

In an instant, Luo Tian’s form vanished from his original position, like a bolt of lightning soaring into the heavens.

“Splitting Heaven Spear! Fourth Form! The Gun Master of the Heavens!” Luo Tian bellowed, gripping the spear as whirlpools of energy enveloped him and the weapon. He stood atop the sky, a sovereign ruler of the world, his gaze fierce as he surveyed the fallen White Bear.

The White Bear, sensing it had only struck a shadow, displayed a flicker of disbelief in its remaining eye before its massive body began to tremble unnaturally.

“Such a terrifying aura!” The White Bear’s voice carried fear as it gazed at Luo Tian and the spear, now wreathed in energy whirlpools. A sense of retreat stirred within it.

Yet as the White Bear prepared to withdraw, Luo Tian moved first. His black spear and his entire body descended slowly toward the beast, forming a colossal shadow of the Splitting Heaven Spear in his grip during the descent.

“Rip…” A sound like tearing fabric echoed as, under the White Bear’s terrified gaze, the black spear tore through space. Then, Luo Tian and the spear vanished into the rift.

“Entered?” The White Bear mused aloud, its remaining eye flashing mockery.

A spatial rift was no place for the faint-hearted. It required a formidable body and an understanding of space—both indispensable. Within such rifts, anything could happen. Even the White Bear, with its mighty form, had no certainty of survival.

“Self-destruction. A pity for all those Xuanbing Su,” the White Bear sighed, its massive body moving away. Its wounds had partially healed; the blood no longer flowed from its right eye, and the wound was beginning to scab. Yet that eye would never recover.

As the White Bear turned, a tremor erupted behind it—a black fissure stretching dozens of feet wide.

“Hum…” A terrifying spear aura emanated from the rift. The black spear, like piercing paper, burst forth and lunged directly at the White Bear’s back.

“Bad!” The White Bear roared, eyes wide with fear as it turned to defend itself.

But in the next moment, the black spear plunged into the White Bear’s body, piercing its heart. That mighty organ was instantly annihilated, and a ten-foot-wide gash appeared on the beast’s chest.

Luo Tian emerged from the wound, a triumphant smile on his face as he gazed at the White Bear’s eyes filled with resentment. The beast collapsed onto the ice, emitting a dull thud.

“Huff…” Luo Tian exhaled deeply, his gaze filled with awe as he looked at the lifeless White Bear.

“Thankfully, I grasped the fourth form of the Splitting Heaven Spear at the crucial moment. I never imagined it could pierce through space—it’s truly unpredictable!” Luo Tian sighed, gently running his hand along the spear.

“Hum…” As if understanding Luo Tian’s words, the Splitting Heaven Spear emitted a series of resonant hums, expressing its pride.

“Enough. Thank you,” Luo Tian smiled, addressing the spear.

He then waved his hand, collecting the White Bear’s corpse into a storage ring. He shouldered the spear and strode toward the edge of Ice Pole Island.

With the White Bear’s example, Luo Tian’s journey was smooth. No beast dared trouble him.

Luo Tian had always maintained: if beasts didn’t provoke him, he wouldn’t retaliate. Even if he encountered one, and it fled, he would not pursue.

But he did not let up on Xuanbing Su. He continued his policy of scouring the land, moving toward Ice Pole Island’s outskirts.

In Ice Pole Island’s sect halls, Luo Zhan led his clan with joy, gazing at a pair of夫妇 standing in the grand hall.

“Respectful greetings to Uncle Second!” Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiuyue bowed deeply, their faces filled with reverence and gratitude.

“Nantian, I never expected you to return so soon! Truly wonderful!” Luo Zhan’s weathered face brimmed with emotion, speechless as he gazed at Luo Nantian.

Luo Nantian and his wife also felt deep emotion, their eyes filled with excitement as they looked at Luo Zhan and the familiar faces around them. Having left the clan for so long, Luo Nantian understood how his family had endured, filling him with deep guilt. He yearned to return and revitalize their lineage.

“Uncle Second, you’ve suffered so much. From now on, no one will dare to oppress us—because I, Luo Nantian, have returned!” Luo Nantian’s face bore a fierce determination, his voice echoing across Ice Pole Island.

Chapter 568: Departing Ice Pole Island

Luo Nantian’s bold words echoed across the island, even reaching the elders. They opened their eyes in joy.

Luo Nantian’s return would undoubtedly elevate Ice Pole Island’s strength. A魂凝境 (Soul Consolidation) master was rare across the Tianyuan Continent, standing among its elite.

“Luo Nantian has returned!” As Luo Nantian’s words faded, clan leaders across Ice Pole Island displayed surprise.

Lu Tai stood in a grand hall, the residence of the collateral branch. Previously, their dwelling had been given to Luo Zhan’s lineage.

“Returned!” Lu Tai’s face bore bitterness, whispering softly. His eyes even held despair.

If Luo Zhan’s lineage lacked Luo Nantian, Lu Tai had confidence in reclaiming the direct line during the next clan competition. But with Luo Nantian, Luo Zhan’s lineage was incomparable to its former self. Not only did Luo Nantian possess terrifying strength, but his immense prestige within the lineage would drive its members to strive harder.

Thus, Lu Tai felt despair. He sighed loudly, gazing at the hall’s exterior.

“Luo Nantian has returned!” Other clan leaders, hearing Luo Nantian’s voice, suddenly opened their eyes. They rushed toward Luo Zhan’s residence to forge an alliance.

Luo Tian, having entered Ice Pole Island’s sect halls, overheard Luo Nantian’s words. He smiled slightly but did not proceed further. Instead, he turned toward the mountain gate.

Luo Tian’s eyes glimmered with amusement as he watched figures flying toward Luo Nantian’s residence. He handed his token to the gatekeeper and strode out.

As Luo Tian stepped outside, he saw two familiar figures. His lips curled into a smile as he approached them.

“Luo Tian, you’ve finally come out. We waited so long!” Xu Liyi frowned, stepping forward.

“Luo大哥, do you have food? Do you have food?” Chen Zhanbiao grumbled, approaching Luo Tian.

Seeing them, Luo Tian smiled and patted Chen Zhanbiao’s shoulder. “Let’s go down the mountain first!”

As Luo Tian spoke, the three left under the respectful gaze of the gatekeepers.

...

“Luo Tian, have you grown stronger again? I feel like I can’t fathom you anymore!” Xu Liyi stood before Luo Tian, his face puzzled.

“Slightly stronger,” Luo Tian sighed, recalling his inner demon trial.

Chen Zhanbiao stood between them, holding a roasted bear paw and gnawing it without heeding their words.

The three flew through the sky, chatting as they headed toward Jinyu City.

Zhang Daotian had instructed Luo Nantian and his wife to inform Luo Tian that Lu Kunpeng’s poison could last half a year. Thus, Luo Tian agreed to train in Ice Pole Island for a while. Otherwise, with his nature, he would have rushed to the Five Elements Sect immediately after obtaining two Xuanbing Su.

Though half a year remained, Luo Tian wished to resolve Lu Kunpeng’s poison as soon as possible. Each day the poison lingered in his body, he felt uneasy.

Thus, Luo Tian had not even greeted his parents before sending Xu Liyi a message to inform them of his departure. Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao, idle by nature, had grown restless in Ice Pole Island. Upon receiving Luo Tian’s message, they decided to accompany him home and explore the Northern Region.

The three flew through the sky, their conversation light. They soon exited Ice Pole Island’s boundaries and arrived above a bustling icy city.

“Xuanbing City!” Xu Liyi gazed at the city with nostalgia, his eyes gleaming.

“Old dog! Come out! Your Xu Uncle is back!” Xu Liyi shouted from above the city.

“Who?” The people below looked puzzled, then their gazes widened in shock.

“Who dares to cause trouble in Xuanbing City?” Xu Liyi’s words echoed, and a voice boomed from the city’s central lord’s mansion.

“Those three! The ones who once battered Luo Family of Xuanbing City!” People gasped, recognizing the three.

Luo Tian and his companions had become celebrities in Xuanbing City. For years, no one dared to cause trouble there—yet it ended without resolution, as if Ice Pole Island had tacitly allowed it.

“Is it you? You dare return to cause trouble!” Three elders materialized before the three, their faces dark.

As Xuanbing City’s lord, they knew Ice Pole Island was hosting a clan competition. They assumed the island had no time to deal with them, and after the competition, Ice Pole Island would surely send strong forces to hunt Luo Tian.

“Old man! Your master has arrived. Kneel and greet!” Xu Liyi mocked the three elders.

“You truly don’t know death! You dare to cause trouble here!” The elders roared, glaring at the three.

“I said I’d return for that one billion energy stones. Have you prepared them? If so, hand them over quickly! I’m in a hurry!” Xu Liyi replied loudly.

“Unconscionable!” The people below stared in disbelief, watching the three with calm faces. They could find no words to describe them.

“Die!” The eldest elder, unable to endure Xu Liyi’s mockery, rushed toward the three.

Luo Tian saw the elder approaching and calmly tossed a jade token. It transformed into a green light, halting the elders.

The three elders paused, clutching the jade token. Their faces turned pale as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“Ritual Soul!” The eldest elder stammered, his eyes trembling as he looked at Luo Tian.

Though Luo Tian had not fully entered Ritual Soul, his aura was formidable. He could even unleash a Soul Consolidation aura with his simulation skill.

The three elders were stunned. In just two months, Luo Tian had transformed from an early Soul Formation to a Ritual Soul master.

Ritual Soul was beyond the reach of secular city lords. They remembered when Luo Tian had first arrived, a novice in Soul Formation. Now he was a Ritual Soul master—this left them speechless.

“Something’s wrong! His energy wings are still present. That means he hasn’t fully entered Ritual Soul. What’s going on? Isn’t it said that failing to enter Ritual Soul results in lightning annihilation?” One elder questioned.

“Huh…” The three didn’t ponder the reason. Luo Tian had failed to ascend but survived, his face filled with fear as he gazed at the three.

When Luo Tian had been in Soul Formation, they had suffered heavy losses. Now his strength had grown significantly, and the two companions were also formidable. How could they face this?

Compromise? Impossible. If they truly handed over the one billion energy stones, they would be dead. At that time, Ice Pole Island’s Luo Family would never forgive them.

But fighting? Now they could not match.

“Seek help!” The three exchanged glances, nodding slightly. They had no choice but to seek Ice Pole Island’s aid and stall Luo Tian until everything was resolved.

As the eldest elder prepared to retrieve his identity token, he suddenly noticed the jade token in his hand. His face turned pale.

“Boom…” Seeing the jade token, the elder’s face paled further. His eyes trembled as he gazed at Luo Tian.

As the elder’s face darkened, his companions also looked at the token. They were no better off, nearly collapsing.

“Lord of Xuanbing City, Luo Zhiyuan, pays homage to the Young Master!” The eldest elder bowed deeply, his face crimson.

“Gasps…” The people below were stunned. They watched the city lord bow to a young man, unable to believe their eyes.

“Who is this youth? He must be the one who made Luo Zhiyuan bow!” The crowd murmured, unable to hear their conversation.

“Get up! I’ve told you before—this is your master. You didn’t bow earlier, now you’ve offended him!” Xu Liyi smirked, addressing the three elders.

Hearing Xu Liyi’s smug tone, Luo Zhiyuan wanted to strangle him. But due to Luo Tian’s presence and his own strength, he could only swallow his anger.

Luo Zhiyuan’s two brothers also bore grim faces, bowing to Luo Tian alongside their elder.

The jade token Luo Tian produced was unmistakable. It was the direct lineage token of Ice Pole Island’s Luo Family. The direct lineage meant the master of Ice Pole Island. Xuanbing City was little more than a servant to Ice Pole Island.

“Prepare one billion energy stones and give them to my companion!” Luo Tian spoke without further ado, sighing inwardly at his father’s gift.

“Yes!” Luo Zhiyuan’s face was grim but he dared not defy Luo Tian. At that moment, Luo Tian’s will represented Ice Pole Island’s will.

“Elder Second and Elder Third, go prepare one billion energy stones for the Young Master!” Luo Zhiyuan ordered his brothers.

Luo Tian and his companions landed, the crowd not daring to approach too closely. They had already realized Luo Tian’s identity was extraordinary.

Upon hearing the elder’s command, Luo Zhiyuan’s two brothers vanished instantly.

“Young Master, is there anything else?” Luo Zhiyuan forced a smile as he addressed the three.

“Nothing. For now, just keep it low. Don’t disgrace Ice Pole Island. Manage your juniors well and avoid unnecessary trouble!” Luo Tian spoke as if scolding grandchildren.

“Damn it, if you hadn’t kept coming to Xuanbing City to provoke us, who would dare act like this!” Luo Zhiyuan mentally cursed but smiled outwardly.

Luo Zhiyuan’s two brothers soon arrived, handing Luo Tian a respectful storage bag.

“Alright. Remember what I said. I won’t trouble you further!” Luo Tian took the bag and handed it to Xu Liyi, then strode away with his companions. Xu Liyi’s laughter echoed behind them.

Seeing the three leave, Luo Zhiyuan’s face turned red. Surrounded by mocking glances, he and his brothers retreated to the city lord’s mansion.

“Luo Family’s direct lineage. This identity truly cost Luo Zhiyuan dearly. I bet the three brothers feel like they’ve eaten dirt,” people murmured, their expressions filled with schadenfreude.

Luo Tian and his companions were unaware of the people’s thoughts. They flew toward Jinyu City, which had a teleportation array.

Happy Valentine’s Day! I’ve been sick these days and feel terrible.

Chapter 570: The Wanted in Feiyan City

Luo Tian and his companions flew to Jinyu City, finding the teleportation array. They paid their fee and stepped onto it.

“Hum…” The familiar vibration beneath their feet transported them to the Northern Region’s Feiyan City.

Luo Tian was not unfamiliar with Feiyan City but not overly so. Three teleportation arrays existed within it, primarily transporting people from the Southern Region. Many returned from the South.

Due to Chen Zhanbiao’s towering height, Luo Tian and his companions stood out. As they stepped off the array, people noticed them.

“Wow, so tall! Is he a beast that has just transformed?” People murmured, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao.

Some saw Luo Tian and displayed shock. Their eyes burned with interest, but no one dared act immediately.

“Is it him!” People whispered among themselves.

“Alas, he dares to return. Isn’t this seeking death!” People gazed at Luo Tian with pity.

Luo Tian’s brow furrowed. Their words reached him and Xu Liyi clearly.

“Brother, you’re the prodigy of Five Elements Sect. The Five Elements Sect is like an emperor in the Northern Region, right? Why do I feel you’re in trouble?” Xu Liyi asked, his gaze amused.

“Luo Tian was puzzled. He knew he had offended people in Feiyan City—two groups. But after so long, he hadn’t expected them to still be hunting him.

“Let’s go. I’ll see who dares to block me, Luo Tian!” Luo Tian didn’t dwell on other thoughts. He greeted Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao, then strode toward the city gate.

People around them knew they weren’t easy to provoke. They made way but followed Luo Tian, some with pity, others with amusement, and some with anxiety.

These expressions made Luo Tian puzzled. As he and his companions reached the city gate, his eyes instantly turned cold.

“Pound…” A deep pit formed beneath Luo Tian’s feet. In an instant, he appeared atop the city gate, lifting a corpse hanging there for days.

Killing intent radiated from Luo Tian. His gaze swept over the crowd, cold and sharp. “Who knows him?”

Luo Tian’s current strength was formidable. His aura could not be endured by these people. They fell silent, and the unfiltered killing intent made them feel as if they were in the Nine Heavens.

Even Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao, seeing Luo Tian in this state for the first time, glanced at the withered corpse beside him, curious about his relationship.

The corpse was ordinary. Its legs had faint glows, suggesting it was a Bone Consolidation master.

Though Bone Consolidation was strong in the Northern Region, Xu Liyi thought this master had no connection to Luo Tian.

“Boom…” As Xu Liyi pondered, a powerful vibration erupted from the crowd. An elder with immense authority arrived before Luo Tian.

“Boy, you’re the one who crippled my son and made my granddaughter lose face?” The elder coldly asked, his gaze icy.

“Feiyan City Lord has arrived!” People gasped, looking at the elder.

Old-timers in Feiyan City knew this elder was Feiyan City Lord Jiang Taihong. His strength reached the terrifying Ritual Soul level, yet he had never established a sect. Instead, he resided in Feiyan City, controlling the teleportation arrays to plunder resources.

Ritual Soul was a godlike presence in the Northern Region. A sect with one such master would be considered a stronghold.

Though Jiang Taihong was only at the early Ritual Soul level, no sect dared to provoke him. Even top-tier sects avoided confrontation, for Jiang Taihong’s greatest advantage was his granddaughter, Jiang Le Rong. Without her, Feiyan City would not have been so lucrative.

Jiang Le Rong was the Young Master of Qionghua Sect, the next sect leader. Qionghua Sect was so powerful that no sect in the Northern Region could match it. Jiang Taihong’s son had been crippled by a boy, and the boy had even left Feiyan City boldly. This enraged Jiang Taihong.

After Luo Tian left Feiyan City, the wanted notice spread again. This time, it included a portrait of Luo Tian in disguise.

Later, Jiang Le Rong reported from the Southern Region that the man she had crippled was the same one who had offended her at the teleportation array. She also provided Luo Tian’s true appearance.

Feiyan City was a hub for inter-regional travel. Upon issuing the wanted notice, Jiang Taihong knew this man was Luo Tian of Five Elements Sect. But he didn’t care, for Qionghua Sect loomed behind him.

After investigation, they found the young man who had given Luo Tian a hat. In anger, he killed him and hung his corpse at the city gate to display their family’s authority.

Seeing Luo Tian stay instead of fleeing, Jiang Taihong felt a surge of satisfaction. He marveled at his own decision.

“Did you kill him? Because he gave me a hat?” Luo Tian’s gaze was filled with killing intent as he addressed Jiang Taihong.

Chapter 571: Unleashing the Killing Intent

Hearing Luo Tian’s question, Jiang Taihong said nothing. Instead, his people shouted loudly, especially the middle-aged men he had crippled.

“Boy, what are you? Five Elements Sect is so great? Today, if you don’t behave, your fate will be the same as his!” Jiang Taihong’s people shouted, pointing at the corpse beside Luo Tian.

“Five Elements Sect’s Luo Tian. Today I will massacre this city! All non-essential people, leave immediately or face the consequences!” Luo Tian ignored Jiang Taihong’s gestures. His cold voice echoed like a frigid wind.

“Haha!” Jiang Taihong’s people laughed, thinking it was the funniest joke. They felt no fear of Luo Tian’s killing intent.

“Ah, young man. Arrogance is good, but arrogance leads to madness. You’re overestimating yourself!” Jiang Taihong realized Luo Tian was indeed from Five Elements Sect. He knew he could not kill him today.

Five Elements Sect was a major sect in the Northern Region. If he killed Luo Tian publicly, it would be like slapping Five Elements Sect in the face. They would surely retaliate.

If Luo Tian had not confessed to being from Five Elements Sect, Jiang Taihong could have killed him and blamed it on an accident. With Qionghua Sect’s power, Five Elements Sect would have no choice but to swallow their anger.

“Five Elements Sect. It’s true! This young man is the one who has been talked about for years!” People gasped, looking at Luo Tian.

After thinking, people realized it was impossible. But with Luo Tian’s fame and Five Elements Sect behind him, they dared not offend. Jiang Taihong’s people were also too powerful to provoke.

After thinking, they all left the city, fearing being caught in the crossfire.

Luo Tian gently collected the young man’s corpse. A green flame emerged from his hand, burning it to ashes. He sighed.

“Forgive me. I never wanted to owe anyone a debt or let others suffer because of me. Today, you gave your life for me. I will repay it with the lives of all Jiang family members in this city!” Luo Tian’s voice was heavy, filled with killing intent.

“Gasps…” As the young man’s corpse burned in the emerald琉璃 fire, it scattered into the air with a breeze.

“Boy, don’t be arrogant. This isn’t Five Elements Sect. Others fear you, but we Jiang family don’t!” One of Jiang Taihong’s people shouted.

From the moment they met, Luo Tian had ignored them. He spoke only to the corpse. Now he threatened their entire family. How could they accept it?

“Smack!” Xu Liyi appeared like a ghost before the shouting man, slapping him away.

“Mistress speaks. Children, stay out of it!” Xu Liyi returned to Luo Tian’s side, his voice playful.

“You!” Seeing Xu Liyi slap his junior, Jiang Taihong’s face turned red with anger.

“Enough!” As Jiang Taihong was about to attack, Luo Tian’s voice echoed in their ears.

“Hum…” Seven-colored energy wings spread from Luo Tian’s back. His voice echoed in the sky, his face cold.

Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao also appeared before Luo Tian. They felt his burning aura, Xu Liyi’s face tense as he wondered how strong Luo Tian was now.

Luo Tian opened his eyes, gazing at Feiyan City spanning hundreds of miles. He watched the last person leave the city, only those in the largest courtyard remained, their faces filled with mockery as they gazed at Luo Tian in the sky.

“Begin!” Luo Tian roared. A green flame dragon emerged from his hand, flying toward Jiang Taihong’s people.

“Plop… I thought it was a strong opponent. A mere grade B martial art, how dare you show off!” A young Jiang family member in the Body Consolidation stage mocked.

“Silence!” Jiang Taihong barked, his face grim as he watched the fire dragon circling.

The power of the martial art was clear to Jiang Taihong. It was grade B, but the green flame unsettled him.

As people pondered, Luo Tian also conjured a fire dragon. He spread his arms, and dozens of green fire dragons emerged from his body.

“Ten… a hundred… a thousand…” A thousand fire dragons burst forth, flying in all directions.

“Crack!” Luo Tian clenched his hand. The thousand fire dragons shattered, becoming countless sparks that drifted into the city.

“Wind!” Luo Tian roared. A gust of wind surged from his body, ensuring each spark reached every corner.

“Something’s wrong!” Jiang Taihong initially dismissed it. He was a Ritual Soul master, confident he could handle any surprise.

But when Luo Tian unleashed over a thousand green fire dragons, Jiang Taihong’s heart sank. The emerald flame gave him an unsettling feeling.

Luo Tian flicked his finger, a drop of blood appearing in his mouth. It transformed into a surge of power.

Though Luo Tian was strong, he lacked the strength to fully unleash the thousand-fire dragon formation. He relied on a drop of blood to activate it.

“Burning Heaven! Flame Formation!” Merging the blood, Luo Tian’s face turned pale. His aura surged, and he slammed his hands into the void.

“Bad!” Jiang Taihong’s face showed shock. He moved, his energy surging as he lifted over a hundred family members into the sky.

“Boom…” As Jiang Taihong’s group reached the sky, a vast firestorm erupted. Feiyan City was instantly engulfed in green flames. The heat pierced the void.

“Help!” People who had calmly watched Luo Tian’s capture were instantly consumed by green flames.

Chapter 572: Let Them Fight

“Lord, save me!”

“Grandfather, save me!” The cries faded. Some hadn’t even managed to shout before being consumed.

“Too terrifying!” Those who had escaped Feiyan City stared in fear, gazing at Luo Tian’s pale face. They were grateful they had left the city. In such heat, they knew they couldn’t survive a breath.

“Luo Tian!” Jiang Taihong glared at Luo Tian, his eyes nearly bleeding. His gaze was fixed on Luo Tian, regret deep within him.

In an instant, his city had vanished. His juniors were all annihilated by Luo Tian’s attack.

Jiang Taihong regretted his mistake. He regretted not killing Luo Tian the moment he saw him, giving him a chance to act.

“I will never forgive you! Even if you are Five Elements Sect’s prodigy, I’ll kill you!” Jiang Taihong’s face was crimson. His voice carried endless killing intent.

Hearing Jiang Taihong, Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly. He gripped the Splitting Heaven Spear and gazed at Jiang Taihong.

“Old man! I’ll see what you can do to me!”
