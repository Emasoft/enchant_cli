"Too ruthless!" Luo Tian's heart tightened. He reached for the pill and placed it in his mouth, then gazed toward where the vengeful infant was subdued. In the deep pit, a small black figure lay there, swaying as it stood up, instantly enveloped in blood, yet its eyes still glowed with cruel and resentful intensity.

"He has eliminated one head!" Gu Qianxue exclaimed, seeing the seven heads atop the vengeful infant now reduced to six.

"I have no more tricks up my sleeve..." Hun Xuan's face wore a smile like crying. He waved his hand, and the soul vase appeared in his grasp; vast numbers of spiritual essences flew out, sweeping toward the vengeful infant.

Originally, Hun Xuan's greatest ace was that half-step Immortal King combined with these spiritual essences, detonated in a special manner. Such power would certainly make an Immortal King halt, but now without that half-step Immortal King, Hun Xuan's ace was greatly diminished.

Yet it was still astonishing. The violent fluctuations swept forth, nine hundred and ninety-nine gray spiritual essences exploded precisely at the same time, forming a gray storm that swept over the vengeful infant's body.

"Roar..." A piercing scream echoed in people's ears, as if silver needles pierced their eardrums, causing expressions of discomfort on everyone's faces.

"A great opportunity!" Gu Qianxue's eyes brightened. She exhaled, and her black sword suddenly erupted, transforming into thousands of sword shadows that vanished from her hand.

"Buzz..." Waves of sword energy merged with the gray storm, beginning to fiercely scour the vengeful infant's body.

Meanwhile, Dahei and Erhei showed no interest in Luo Tian's side, beginning to devour the vengeful infant's domain, having already consumed a fifth of it.

Luo Tian swallowed the pill given by Yin Xiu, his injuries instantly recovered. His gaze was cautious as he watched the storm; he knew this storm, though powerful, could not destroy the vengeful infant.

Indeed, after sweeping for half a moment, the storm finally ceased. The void began to mend, and the vengeful infant swayed again, standing up with only five heads remaining on its head.

"Roar..." An angry sound echoed, as if the vengeful infant's ferocity was fully awakened. As it roared loudly, a torrential aura surged from its body. Under the shock of Luo Tian and others, the remaining five heads suddenly extended, while numerous black arms burst through its body, appearing in people's sight.

"This..." Seeing the vengeful infant's transformation, everyone's faces showed shock, their hearts violently constricted.

"Boom..." Next, the twelve arms began to move rapidly. Six martial techniques with overwhelming power shot out from six hand signs, charging toward Luo Tian and the others.

"Originally, he knows martial techniques!" Luo Tian gazed at the awe-inspiring techniques, his face paling. These were Immortal King-level strikes; now they could not be called a single strike but six.

However, since the group had previously eliminated several of the vengeful infant's heads, its strength had dropped by three-tenths. Moreover, Dahei and Erhei had destroyed most of the domain, making these techniques seem weaker than a true Immortal King's strike.

Luo Tian leaped into the air, standing before everyone. The "Manifestation of Heaven and Earth" technique instantly transformed him into a thousand-zhang-tall giant, like a mountain. At this moment, everyone's condition was poor; they had paid a heavy price after eliminating two of the vengeful infant's heads.

Boom after boom... Luo Tian's massive body stood before everyone, being continuously struck by six techniques. His colossal form pushed Gu Qianxue and Fuxingyue back. Six resounding explosions, under people's shock, Luo Tian's entire body shattered limbs, chest caved in, even revealing a heart still leaping wildly. His head was riddled with cracks, and he collapsed onto the ground.

"This is too harsh... If it were Luo Tian's physical body, he might have resisted a little, but with these techniques, even his flesh and blood couldn't withstand!" Fuxingyue had never seen Luo Tian so helpless before.

"Buzz..." The effect of the Revive Immortal Pill took hold. Luo Tian's limbs healed at a visible speed, but his face was pale.

Zhou Zhiwen and others had cold sweat on their brows. Fortunately, it was Luo Tian; they estimated that with their physical strength, they might not have endured the Revive Immortal Pill's effects, leaving no remnants or spiritual essences.

"This is too strong. Should we retreat?" Zhou Zhiwen spoke, the first time he had suggested retreating since entering the Illusory Demon Forest. The vengeful infant's might had left him desperate.

As Zhou Zhiwen spoke, the vengeful infant's second attack formed instantly. Six terrifying martial techniques made everyone's faces show despair.

"Subdue it!" Luo Tian roared. He knew he couldn't wait; if he did, he wouldn't hold on. He directly activated his final ace—techniques left in his body by Du Jianxing and others. He had used it once before, but three Immortal King-level attacks remained. Luo Tian was certain that three strikes would make the vengeful infant suffer.

As he spoke, a thunderous explosion shook the heavens. A massive black hand burst forth from Luo Tian, radiating terrifying fluctuations like a dark cloud, rushing toward the six techniques. Destroying heaven and earth, upon its appearance, everyone felt a suffocating pressure—this was an authentic Immortal King-level strike. Its power surpassed that of Zhou Zhiwen's previous spell.

"What else can't Luo Xiong accomplish?" Yin Xiu exclaimed, surprised that even in such a desperate situation, Luo Tian still had techniques left unutilized.

Crash, crash, crash... The heavens and earth shattered like the end of days. The six techniques that had nearly killed Luo Tian disintegrated rapidly before the black hand, which still radiated overwhelming power, charging toward the vengeful infant.

"Ah..." The vengeful infant roared, its body beginning to grow wildly, though its appearance remained the same.

"Boom..." In an instant, the black hand pressed down on the vengeful infant's body, causing its five heads to spit blood simultaneously.

"Again!" Luo Tian roared. In the thunderous explosion, another black mountain soared forth, still radiating overwhelming power, leaving Yin Xiu and others in disbelief.

"Boom..." The black mountain crashed down, directly pressing upon the vengeful infant spitting blood.

The thunderous explosions surged, the sea of energy churned. Without hesitation, Luo Tian unleashed his final Immortal King-level technique. If the vengeful infant could withstand it and maintain its previous strength, Luo Tian would have no choice but to retreat.

Another deafening sound. The entire world seemed to fall silent, and the cave trembled violently, on the verge of collapse.

"Should it be dead? After all, this was three Immortal King-level attacks!" Zhou Zhiwen trembled as he spoke, gazing at the still trembling ruins.

"It's not dead!" Gu Qianxue's black eye on her forehead flashed with intense light, exclaiming.

As Gu Qianxue's words just ended, a streak of light burst from the ruins, appearing in people's sight and rushing toward Luo Tian.

"Boom..." Luo Tian punched, colliding with the fist. His massive body kept retreating, but his eyes showed a hint of joy.

"Only three left!" Zhou Zhiwen exclaimed, sensing the vengeful infant's aura was no longer as fierce as before. Under his confrontation, Luo Tian only spat blood and retreated.

"The Immortal King's cultivation has finally dropped!" Luo Tian panted, gazing at the vengeful infant retreating as well. Now it had only three heads, six arms, and one head was extremely withered.

"Roar..." At the same time, San Touquan and Erhei had finally devoured the domain entirely. The two creatures had bulging bellies.

"Things will be much easier now!"

"Rest yourselves. I'll deal with him first. When the time comes, we'll strike together and destroy him!" Luo Tian addressed Gu Qianxue and others. He planted his feet and rushed toward the vengeful infant.

"Good!" Zhou Zhiwen and others looked with admiration, retreating from the battle to recover quickly. Yin Xiu was not stingy at all; he distributed top-grade pills for everyone to eat, as they were worried that even with this, Luo Tian might not hold out.

Chapter 2333: The Six Steps of the Ferocious God

The vengeful infant with three heads and six arms remained formidable, charging toward Luo Tian and the others. Standing before them, Luo Tian showed no fear. He unleashed the "Heavenly Man's Dao Method," countering the vengeful infant's remaining, albeit slight, domain power.

As he spoke, the vengeful infant had reached Luo Tian's vicinity. Six fists all struck toward him, their might overwhelming.

Luo Tian's eyes showed coldness. His massive body punched out, clashing with the vengeful infant. Though it seemed like an ant to Luo Tian, its strength was still respected.

Boom... The thunderous explosions echoed. Six fists collided with Luo Tian's punch, sending his massive body flying back while the vengeful infant also recoiled.

"Sixfold Physical Strength!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. Even with his cultivation dropped to a half-step Immortal King, the vengeful infant's strength was still terrifying.

Through the "Heavenly Demon Liberation," Luo Tian could now unleash fivefold physical strength, his power approaching that of an Immortal King's early stage. However, the vengeful infant was even more formidable—three heads and six arms with sixfold physical strength. Luo Tian could hardly imagine how he had survived in the vengeful infant's previous state. If not for their numerous Immortal King techniques, they might have been annihilated.

"Crash..." As Luo Tian pondered, three martial techniques descended from the sky with astonishing power, pressing toward him.

"This is still a challenge!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He danced his hands, extending the "Purgatory Ghost Claws," while Longyuan Sword and Moming Sword appeared in his grasp. Indeed, two legendary swords were difficult to control for one person; Luo Tian's attempt to wield both led to conflict.

"Stay still!" Luo Tian roared, constantly suppressing the two swords clashing against each other.

"Buzz..." In an instant, the two long swords erupted with ten thousand feet of brilliance. Sword energy swept across, slashing toward the three techniques. The sword intent was overwhelming; Luo Tian transformed into a storm, surrounded by waves of energy, sweeping toward the vengeful infant. The vengeful infant roared, its three heads and six arms striking repeatedly against Luo Tian. A massive body clashed with a smaller one, forming countless残影, their speed so fast that even Zhou Zhiwen could barely discern their movements.

The heavens and earth trembled, thunderous explosions echoed. People could only hear the resounding sound of heaven-shaking collisions. Luo Tian possessed legendary swords, while the vengeful infant had three heads and six arms; their current strength was roughly equal. However, as time passed, Luo Tian grew increasingly anxious. Though he could withstand the vengeful infant's attacks and recover from his injuries due to Yin Xiu's Revive Immortal Pill, once the pill's power faded, he would be at a disadvantage. In contrast, the vengeful infant seemed nearly immortal, with no apparent limits. They continued clashing.

Yet, Luo Tian noticed that as their attacks grew fiercer, one of the vengeful infant's heads began to wither. He was certain that eliminating another head would make the vengeful infant no match for him.

"Destroy it once more. If I can weaken its strength further, I'll be able to crush it!" Luo Tian muttered, contemplating strategies against the vengeful infant.

Luo Tian had a significant advantage: his mind. Though the vengeful infant possessed some cognition, it was simplistic, its intelligence barely surpassing that of an infant. It relied solely on instinct to fight Luo Tian.

"Supreme Stone, can you still act now?" Luo Tian turned his hopes to the Supreme Stone.

"Can't. I've already used a lot of energy helping you break that seal. What do you think I am, a resource to be exploited? That seal was created by an ancient sage!" The Supreme Stone responded to Luo Tian, causing him to sigh deeply.

"Then I must attempt the sixth step of the Ferocious God's Steps. First, I need to grasp the sixfold physical strength of the 'Frenzied Wind' technique!" Luo Tian muttered. At this moment, he could only match the vengeful infant's strength; to defeat it, he needed to employ extraordinary methods.

Though "Sword of Heaven" was powerful, Luo Tian couldn't use it; Zhou Zhiwen and others were present. If the secret was exposed, even the Eternal Immortal King might personally retaliate.

But grasping "Frenzied Wind" was no simple task. Luo Tian had only managed to take the fifth step of combining it with his enhanced strength.

"Wait, sixfold physical strength—this vengeful infant is already attacking me with that!" Luo Tian's eyes brightened. He gripped his swords, leaped into the air, and instantly rushed toward the vengeful infant.

"Buzz..." Longyuan Sword slashed downward, striking the vengeful infant. The wide blade made it feel a tremendous threat. Four hands lifted in unison, small yet powerful, directly striking the wide Longyuan Sword, halting its blade at the vengeful infant's head.

Meanwhile, two other hands struck toward Luo Tian, blocking Moming Sword's attack.

They separated instantly. Luo Tian's eyes flickered slightly; he quickly retrieved Longyuan and Moming Sword, then leaped into the air. Four punches converged, striking toward the vengeful infant.

The vengeful infant roared loudly, six black fists striking Luo Tian. Six resounding explosions followed, each fist colliding with Luo Tian's punch, causing him to spit blood again. His body radiated green energy as he retreated.

Yet Luo Tian showed no signs of pain, rushing toward the vengeful infant again with another punch.

The vengeful infant continuously attacked, each time pushing Luo Tian back and making him spit blood. However, Luo Tian gave no opportunity for the vengeful infant to strike; he engaged in hand-to-hand combat, allowing it to unleash only one or two techniques at most.

"Is Luo Tian mad? This vengeful infant's self-healing ability is so变态, yet he still chooses to fight with his body!" Zhou Zhiwen and others, though recovering, watched the battlefield in shock.

"He must have his reasons!" Fuxingyue spoke, her gaze filled with confidence. She was certain that Luo Tian had a way to kill this vengeful infant.

"But if the effects of the Revive Immortal Pill wear off, Luo Tian will be in even worse shape!" Yin Xiu spoke. He knew the pill's power, but with Luo Tian's current consumption, he wouldn't last long.

Though their hearts were worried, the sense of danger wasn't as intense. If they fully recovered, they could at least escape from this vengeful infant's grasp.

Time passed. Half an hour had elapsed, and Luo Tian's injuries multiplied, his recovery rate slowing down. His face was pale, but his eyes glowed brighter.

"Boom..." After another clash, Luo Tian spat blood again. The last trace of green energy vanished.

"Manifestation of Heaven and Earth!" As he retreated, Luo Tian formed a hand seal. His body expanded to a thousand-zhang height, gazing at the vengeful infant with an overwhelming gaze.

"Win or lose here!" Luo Tian roared, causing Zhou Zhiwen and others to solemnly nod. After half an hour of recovery, their injuries had largely healed.

"God's Wrath Step Nine Heavens!" Roaring, Luo Tian took a step forward. His massive foot slammed down toward the vengeful infant.

"Roar..." The vengeful infant roared, six arms striking out. They collided with Luo Tian's foot.

"Boom..." A deep sound echoed. Luo Tian's massive body was instantly repelled, but he quickly stood up. The second step was taken, yet the result remained the same—his body was repelled again, even producing a crackling sound. The third and fourth steps followed; Luo Tian seemed unaffected, taking two more steps forward. His body's power accumulated steadily, creating a heavy pressure that made the vengeful infant feel a hint of danger. Six arms formed hand signs, three martial techniques shot out immediately, colliding with the two feet.

Boom... Explosions echoed across heaven and earth. The sky shattered, as if a hole was torn through it. Simultaneously, a black mountain descended from the sky, pressing down on Luo Tian's massive body.

Luo Tian planted his feet and raised both hands to the sky, meeting the black mountain. A deep sound echoed above Luo Tian's head. As his massive body fell, the fifth step was taken.

Using the black mountain's powerful impact and the fifth step's power, it directly pressed down on the vengeful infant's body.

The earth trembled. Invisible fluctuations spread outward, even causing Gu Qianxue and others sitting still to feel a shudder. They sensed the power of this step.

"It's not dead!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with brilliance. He felt the tremor beneath his feet, and his massive body leaped into the air again. The accumulated power burst forth, forming six leg shadows beneath him—this was the "Six Steps of the Ferocious God" that shook heaven and earth.

The thunderous sound echoed in all directions. As six steps were taken, the entire world seemed to pause. His thick foot, like a pillar of heaven, pressed down with overwhelming force.

"Roar..." The vengeful infant roared. It felt the strength of Luo Tian's attack, and its black scales suddenly flared up. Its dark eyes finally showed fear.

"Crash..." A series of scales flew from the vengeful infant's body, hovering above it and forming a black hand. This hand met Luo Tian's sixth step.

"Ah..." Luo Tian roared, his body losing eight-tenths of its cultivation power. His legs cracked repeatedly, as if on the verge of bursting.

"This attack is too strong!" Zhou Zhiwen and others exclaimed, instinctively retreating.

The thunderous sound was deafening. In an instant, Luo Tian's foot pressed down on the black scale hand that had risen from the vengeful infant.

The scales formed a hand, which was instantly shattered by this step. It became a series of black streaks, slicing through the void and scattering outward.

"Boom..." Like an earthquake, its power swept across all directions. The entire cave trembled violently and finally collapsed into ruins.

Chapter 2334: The Mind Demon Grand Canon

Luo Tian's massive form disintegrated, and a storm of dust enveloped the scene.

"How is it?" People's faces showed shock as they gazed at the swirling dust. Luo Tian's manifestation had disintegrated, clearly indicating he was severely injured from their collision.

"This is a terrifying strike. Even if it can't kill the vengeful infant, it would definitely wound it and eliminate one head!" Fuxingyue frowned, cautiously approaching the dust.

"Go help him!" Gu Qianxue's black eye on her forehead flashed with intense light. She then flew into the dust.

"Kill!" As Gu Qianxue moved, Fuxingyue cautiously rushed ahead of her into the dust.

On the gray ruins, Luo Tian lay there with blood trickling from his mouth. One of his legs was completely shattered and missing, his face showing a bitter smile.

Nearby, a small black figure lay there as well. However, its eyes glowed with fierce intent. It stood up and transformed into a streak of light, rushing toward Luo Tian.

The vengeful infant's mouth trickled with blood. Its head had been reduced to two, appearing somewhat weak. Its aura was now that of a true immortal king's peak.

Yet even so, the vengeful infant was far better off than Luo Tian. He could not shout out; he could only watch as the vengeful infant approached him.

"Roar..." The vengeful infant roared, showing no hesitation. Two sharp teeth lunged toward Luo Tian's neck. It felt that if it absorbed this person who had wounded it, its strength would recover significantly. Then, after absorbing the others, it could return to its peak state.

Just as the vengeful infant bit down, Fuxingyue arrived. Her Star Moon Divine Spear erupted and struck toward the vengeful infant.

The vengeful infant instantly sensed danger. It vanished from its spot, leaving Fuxingyue's strike to miss.

"Boom..." The ground beside Luo Tian cracked, forming a large pit. This made Luo Tian's heart tremble; if it had been slightly off, the Star Moon Divine Spear would have crushed his head.

"Sorry, I missed!" Fuxingyue's face showed embarrassment. She cautiously stood beside Luo Tian, not daring to act recklessly.

"His strength has dropped to the peak of a true immortal king. The rest is up to you!" Luo Tian finally caught his breath and spoke to Fuxingyue, causing her eyes to brighten slightly.

"Luo Tian!" Gu Qianxue also rushed over, standing beside Luo Tian. Seeing his pitiful state, she felt uneasy.

"How is it?" At this moment, the dust had cleared. Zhou Zhiwen and others gathered around.

"Nothing serious. Hurry up and kill it!" Luo Tian spoke weakly, forcing himself to stay conscious despite the pain.

Luo Tian's cost was too great. His entire leg had been shattered, and his body seemed on the verge of collapse. To recover, if he didn't have special means, it would take at least a year and a half. The most severe part was his leg; recovery was too complicated. Unless an immortal king used the power of heaven and earth to restore it, Luo Tian's strength alone could not recover.

"Master Luo, after returning, I will have the immortal king of Zhongtian Commerce Guild restore your leg!" Zhou Zhiwen looked at Luo Tian, his face showing admiration.

Without Luo Tian, they might have already become the vengeful infant's food. Even after eliminating four heads, they weren't match for it before.

Life and death truly forged bonds. Their shared near-death experiences created friendship, especially with Luo Tian, who had saved their lives multiple times. Whether it was due to his strength or his help, they all wanted to be friends with Luo Tian.

From the strength and techniques Luo Tian had shown over these days, he would surely become a major power. Though he might not reach the level of the nine immortal kings, he would certainly leave his mark in the celestial realm.

"Crack..." As they spoke, Fuxingyue had already taken her Star Moon Divine Spear and clashed with the vengeful infant. They were evenly matched, with the vengeful infant unleashing its ferocity.

"We should help him!" Seeing Fuxingyue and the vengeful infant evenly matched, they felt joy and rushed toward the vengeful infant.

Though the vengeful infant was ferocious, it was now at its last gasp. Its strength had dropped to the peak of a true immortal king, matching Zhou Zhiwen and others. Fuxingyue was a half-step immortal king; she alone subdued the vengeful infant. With Zhou Zhiwen, Yin Xiu, and Hun Xuan's combined strength, they completely subdued the vengeful infant. The remaining two heads were withered and on the verge of disappearing.

"Damn it, I finally got my revenge. Little thing, today I'll peel your skin!" Yin Xiu shouted, his voice filled with satisfaction. His long sword continuously slashed at the vengeful infant's body, leaving it with more bloodstains.

"Roar..." The vengeful infant continuously roared. It wanted to escape; if it left this place, with enough time, it could recover. Then it would easily destroy these ants. Though the vengeful infant's intelligence was low, it felt resentment. To it, these people were food, yet they had wounded it so severely. This made the vengeful infant even more furious. According to logic, it should have left when it dropped to a half-step immortal king. But it was holding onto resentment, so it stayed and continued fighting.

"Want to run?" However, at this moment, the vengeful infant wanted to escape. Zhou Zhiwen and others wouldn't let it go, continuously striking it so that it had no chance to escape. They sealed all its paths.

Time passed. After Fuxingyue and others' attacks, the vengeful infant tried to break out several times but was trapped tightly. The two heads gradually withered and disappeared. Finally, Gu Qianxue's bloodstained sword with inscriptions sliced the vengeful infant in two.

"Boom..." Under people's joy, a black stone floated out from the vengeful infant's body—this was the longed-for幻魔石.

"Growl..." A sound echoed from the stone, a ghostly figure wandering within it.

"Come out!" Gu Qianxue formed hand signs, inscribing ghostly energy into the stone. The figure inside screamed in pain and finally emerged from the stone, appearing as the vengeful infant. However, it was now weak and powerless, though its eyes still glowed with ferocity.

"Is this the thing?" Zhou Zhiwen and others looked at the black creature floating on Gu Qianxue's hand, unable to imagine that this was what had nearly killed them all.

"Kill it!" Yin Xiu shouted. For such a thing, they had suffered heavy losses.

"Buddha, please let this vengeful infant be given to me!" However, as they shouted, Jie Du the monk stepped forward with his hands clasped.

"Jie Du, are you crazy? This is a nine-generation vengeful infant!" Hearing Jie Du's words, Yin Xiu and others were unwilling. They had to kill this thing to satisfy their hatred.

"Luo Tian previously promised me he would give this vengeful infant to me!" Jie Du's gaze turned toward Luo Tian. As Jie Du spoke, everyone's eyes turned to Luo Tian, the one with the most authority here.

"Give it to him. Give it to him!" Luo Tian sighed, though this vengeful infant was no longer a threat. Giving it to Jie Du would also change his direction, allowing Luo Tian's ears to be quiet.

Gu Qianxue waved her hand and sent the vengeful infant to Jie Du. Jie Du's eyes brightened, forming a Buddha seal and sealing the vengeful infant.

"幻魔石!" After dealing with the vengeful infant, everyone's eyes turned to Fuxingyue holding the stone.

"Good. Everyone, take in this half-step Mind Demon Grand Canon. I believe it will be helpful for all of you!" Luo Tian spoke softly, having taken a pill. His complexion improved somewhat, though his leg remained unrecovered.

"Good!" Fuxingyue spoke softly and infused true immortal strength into the stone. A series of black vapors spread from it, enveloping everyone.

"The Mind Demon Grand Canon was created by me. I carved this stone to allow my descendants to cultivate it, defy heaven and earth, and inherit my legacy!" A solemn voice echoed in their minds. At the same time, a series of incantations were imprinted into their minds.

Luo Tian now sat in the small cart made by Lei Yong, closing his eyes to begin practicing the Mind Demon Grand Canon. Everyone sat in meditation, but Jie Du did not practice it. In his view, this was a demonic sect's technique; if he practiced it, he would become too immersed in demonry.

Luo Tian listened to the complete Mind Demon Grand Canon, his heart filled with joy. He marveled at the person who created this Grand Canon; it must be even more extraordinary than Chen Tianxin. If practiced normally, the Mind Demon Grand Canon was a supreme technique for celestial realm cultivators, with no demonic dominance. However, if practiced in reverse, it became a demonic sect's technique and was extremely powerful, with an overwhelming dominance. It also completely solved the issue of lacking demonic energy.

"Buzz..." As time passed, everyone was quite pleased. They abandoned their original techniques and began practicing the Mind Demon Grand Canon. Soon after, a series of suction forces emerged from their bodies.

"It's three times faster than my usual cultivation speed!" Zhou Zhiwen and others were delighted. After just a short while of practice, they felt the power of the Mind Demon Grand Canon.

After an hour, everyone opened their eyes joyfully. Only Luo Tian remained seated in the cart, his body swirling with black energy. Above him, dark clouds drifted.

"What's going on? None of us are about to face a tribulation. Where did these dark clouds come from?" Seeing the black clouds, people's faces changed slightly.

"Is it Luo Tian? Is he about to ascend to an immortal king?" Fuxingyue looked at Luo Tian, also puzzled.

Chapter 2335: Disappearance

People were confused. They didn't know why dark clouds suddenly appeared. Zhou Zhiwen and others dared not stay, so Fuxingyue pushed Luo Tian's cart out of the cave.

However, as they carried Luo Tian and flew, the massive dark clouds followed them. This left people confused.

"It must be Luo Tian!" Fuxingyue stopped the cart and looked at Luo Tian, who was still closed-eyed.

"Buzz..." As Fuxingyue's words just ended, a spiral of spiritual energy converged toward Luo Tian. Terrifying spiritual energy transformed into a storm, pouring into Luo Tian's body.

It felt pleasant. Previously, Luo Tian had endured much pain by reversing the Mind Demon Grand Canon, opening up blocked meridians and making him extremely painful. But after the pain came opportunity.

As his meridians were opened, Luo Tian reversed the half-step Mind Demon Grand Canon and began absorbing the terrifying spiritual energy.

The spiritual energy roamed within Luo Tian's body, but in a strange way it transformed into demonic energy. It flowed through the ghost meridians toward Luo Tian's dantian.

"Boom... Boom..." The black demon within the dantian continuously absorbed demonic energy, gradually becoming solid.

"Only one step left to become a half-step immortal king!" Luo Tian muttered. He hadn't expected himself to reach this level so quickly.

"What's going on? How can a demon cultivator use spiritual energy to cultivate?" Zhou Zhiwen and others showed disbelief, watching Luo Tian absorb the spiritual energy.

But if they reversed this half-step Mind Demon Grand Canon, it became a demonic sect's technique and was extremely powerful. It also completely solved the issue of lacking demonic energy.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian absorbed more spiritual energy, a series of thunderous sounds and shouts echoed in his mind.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian felt a sense of danger. He regained consciousness and opened his eyes.

Luo Tian hadn't opened his eyes yet, but a golden lightning bolt had already imprinted itself in his eyes. This made him slightly tremble.

"So soon?" Luo Tian thought of the experience with the幻魔石. Practicing the true Mind Demon Grand Canon would summon a tribulation, and it would strike every ninety-nine days.

As Luo Tian was still confused, golden lightning struck his head. This made his body tremble violently. A tingling sensation made his face look unwell, and his entire body was wrapped in golden lightning.

The golden lightning directly targeted Luo Tian's dantian, making him curse inwardly: "Damn it, that first-generation demon seed tricked me!"

The first-generation demon seed's records clearly stated that one could cultivate the Heaven Demon Grand Canon and choose to avoid tribulation, forging a demonic altar. However, this lightning directly targeted Luo Tian's dantian without him even thinking of forging a demonic altar.

"You damn it!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly. His dantian felt like it was being torn apart, and the lightning swept over the black demon within. This made Luo Tian's body tremble violently.

This tribulation could be withstood by Luo Tian's physical body, but it seemed to have a special nature. It passed through everything and struck Luo Tian's dantian.

"This isn't tricking me, is it?" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He could only endure the tribulation and hope that the demon within his dantian wouldn't be shattered. It wasn't yet time for it to break.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian was frustrated, the second tribulation struck. A golden lightning snake descended from the sky.

This time, Luo Tian was well-prepared. Though he had sustained injuries, this tribulation was merely a celestial-level one. He could fully withstand it.

"Boom..." Luo Tian sat in the cart and punched, instantly shattering the golden lightning. Electric energy flowed through his body but still seeped into his dantian, striking the small figure seated within. However, this time was better than before; it had been shattered once already. Still, the tribulation's arrival in his dantian was very dangerous, causing Luo Tian to feel pain as well.

Before Luo Tian could recover, the third thunderous lightning struck. The thick lightning snake made Luo Tian's mouth twitch. He wasn't worried about his physical body but rather his dantian. If it were struck by lightning, he would be considered crippled even if he didn't die.

"Who plays like this? It's just forcing me to do it!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly, feeling that many of the previous demon seeds must have been tricked to death by this first-generation demon seed.

"Luo Tian, are you practicing the Mind Demon Grand Canon in reverse? It's hard for a demon cultivator to resist temptation!" People were shocked, watching Luo Tian actually practice it in reverse.

"From now on, this kid's life will be much harder!" Fuxingyue looked with sympathy but also a bit of worry, fearing Luo Tian might not endure in the future.

"Boom..." Luo Tian had no time to think further. He sat on the cart and punched again, shattering the lightning. The thunder still gathered in his dantian, striking the black demon within.

"Roar..." The demon within Luo Tian's dantian roared with him. Luo Tian rolled off the golden cart, trembling all over.

The black demon had electric patterns flowing through it. It emitted a weak aura and looked like it was about to collapse, making Luo Tian relieved that the fourth tribulation hadn't descended. If another one came, he would be dead or at least lose a layer of skin.
