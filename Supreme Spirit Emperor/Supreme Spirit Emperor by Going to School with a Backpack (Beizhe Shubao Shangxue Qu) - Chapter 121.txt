Though only a dozen or so people, combined with the overwhelming sea of insects, it sent shivers down their spines, suppressing all their spiritual pressure.

"Here we are! This is the Southern Region!" A dozen young men's gazes swept over the other three regions' disciples, causing people to startle involuntarily.

"Western Region!" Jin Wu Long and other Southern Region's young geniuses, their eyes revealing solemnity as they gazed upon the dozen youths clad in strange attire. "They're from the Western Region."

After a brief glance at everyone, these dozen youths didn't exchange words with anyone. They stood calmly in the sky, gazing into the void as if waiting for something.

The entire ten thousand space felt stifled by their presence, even those few who had intended to trouble Luo Tian retreated into their ranks, eyes filled with vigilance.

Chapter 592: The Opening of the Divine Ancient Gate ()

Chapter 592: The Opening of the Divine Ancient Gate

The Western Region has always been renowned for its mystery and power. Compared to the enigmatic Kunlun Mountains of the Eastern Region, it is even more mysterious—entirely permeated by toxic barriers. All Western Region cultivators, regardless of their cultivation level, possess astonishing mastery over poisons.

Since ancient times, the Western Region has ceased to open transmission arrays leading to other regions. Only during the opening of the Divine Ancient Ruins do Western Region geniuses appear. What terrifies people is that historically, whenever someone from the Western Region entered the Divine Ancient Ruins, the number of deaths was several times that of other openings.

Thus, people from the Western Region are seen as peculiar and terrifyingly powerful in other regions.

The entire world fell into a quiet stillness, save for the sound of people arriving—cracking air noises—and the insect sounds before these dozen Western Region youths.

Time passed slowly, and in this oppressive atmosphere, nearly three hours had elapsed.

Luo Tian and others stood there, chatting softly. Luo Tian's gaze occasionally flickered toward the dozen Western Region youths in the sky, his eyes flashing cold.

With Zheng Xin's ceaseless chatter, their group had no shortage of topics; these dozens gradually became familiar.

"Brother, you're my third greatest confidant!" Zheng Xin grabbed Xu Liyi's hand, his face alight with excitement as he muttered incessantly.

Xu Liyi seemed to have found a kindred spirit, engaging Zheng Xin in heated debate. This left Luo Tian's group speechless.

Cold Qiu Chan and Duan Xingchen were astonished that anyone could match Zheng Xin's speed of speech and thought, their gazes toward Xu Liyi filled with admiration.

Luo Tian was also stunned, watching Xu Liyi in disbelief—Xu Liyi not only spoke rapidly but could match Zheng Xin's talent.

"Jiang Xiong, why have you come too?" Luo Tian approached Jiang Nanxuan, speaking softly.

"Staying in the Purple Bamboo Forest for too long gets boring, so I came out to wander. Cultivation begins with the heart, right?" Jiang Nanxuan smiled at Luo Tian.

"Cultivation begins with the heart!" Luo Tian murmured, his face showing a subtle expression. His gaze was complex as he looked at Jiang Nanxuan.

"Is it because my heart's trial isn't overcome? Because I haven't cultivated my nature enough?" Luo Tian asked, his eyes filled with confusion as he looked at Jiang Nanxuan. He received only Jiang Nanxuan's calm gaze in return.

"Boom... Boom..." As Luo Tian pondered, thunderous sounds erupted from the sky, a terrifying fluctuation instantly spreading into the hearts of the ten thousand people. They instinctively gazed upward.

"The Divine Ancient Gate is coming!" The crowd erupted in cheers, their eyes fixed on the golden door emerging from the void.

"Boom... Boom..." The thunderous sounds grew louder, even causing Luo Tian's group to feel their minds waver.

In the thunderous noise, the sky seemed torn open by an invisible hand, revealing a black void hundreds of miles long. Countless lightning bolts shot out from the void, sending chills down people's spines.

Then a brilliant golden light, accompanied by terrifying pressure, slowly flew toward the Tianyuan Continent from the void.

"The Divine Ancient Gate! That's the Divine Ancient Gate!" Everyone widened their eyes, gazing at the golden door that radiated endless gold light.

Heavenly might—this golden door seemed to carry divine authority, as if it had traversed the river of time from the void. An ancient aura permeated people's minds through this gate.

Luo Tian was at a loss for words to describe the golden door, certain that if it were an artifact, this artifact definitely surpassed the Heavenly grade.

"Crash..." With violent lightning and scattered golden light, the Divine Ancient Gate finally stood before people's expectations.

"Charge..." At the moment the Divine Ancient Gate appeared, ten thousand灵境 (Nascent Soul) and 祭魄境 (Soul Offering) cultivators rushed toward it like madmen.

"Buzz..." But in the next moment, a wave of pressure emanated from the golden door, causing some Nascent Soul cultivators who had reached the front to stop instantly.

"This is the first trial of entering the Divine Ancient Ruins. Those without a Divine Ancient Gate Token must break through the gate, earning its recognition to enter the Ruins!" Chen Changsheng sighed, taking out a copper token from his storage bag.

"The副令 (sub-token) of the Divine Ancient Gate Token!" At the moment Chen Changsheng revealed the token, people's faces immediately showed greed. However, due to Luo Tian's group's formidable strength, no one dared to act.

As Chen Changsheng revealed the Divine Ancient Gate Token, Cold Qiu Chan and Zheng Xin also took out their tokens. They exchanged glances before finally fixing their eyes on Luo Tian.

"Luo Tian, you don't have a Divine Ancient Gate Token, do you?" Zheng Xin asked, his face filled with disbelief.

"Yes, Luo Tian, why didn't you say earlier? I've intercepted many before, but sold them all!" Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao each held a token as they addressed Luo Tian.

Luo Tian smiled bitterly. It wasn't that he lacked one, but he knew his Divine Ancient Gate Token was one of the twelve main tokens. If he revealed it, it might cause trouble.

"You all go in first!" Luo Tian told the group before him, indicating they should enter first. He would find a way himself—this much confidence he still had.

Light flashed, and countless people rushed toward the Divine Ancient Gate like madmen—some with tokens, others with swirling spiritual energy, striking at the gate.

Of course, some were repelled by the gate's immense counter-force, spitting blood and looking bitterly unwilling.

"The sub-token of the Divine Ancient Gate Token is worth ten thousand, while the main token only twelve. Legends say these twelve main tokens can unlock the most coveted inheritance within the Divine Ancient Ruins—the inheritance of the Divine Ancient Twelve Emperors.

The Divine Ancient Twelve Emperors were titans in the most ancient times, nearly reaching the realm of界尊 (World Lord). Over time, they clashed with the Tian Shi Sect in a great battle. Ultimately, they perished in a fierce clash against the sect's imperial-level masters, vanishing into the world.

Luo Tian recalled information about the Divine Ancient Ruins, his face showing anticipation as he gazed at the golden door. Zheng Xin, Lei Yong, Chen Changsheng, and others had already rushed into the Divine Ancient Gate with sub-tokens.

Luo Tian watched as each prodigy rushed into the gate, his battle spirit surging. He transformed into a seven-colored rainbow and charged toward the Divine Ancient Gate.

Chapter 593: The Arrival of the Moon ()

Chapter 593: The Arrival of the Moon

In the boundless central region of the Southern Region, a golden door stood in the world. Countless cultivators rushed toward it like ants.

Countless cultivators were repelled by the gate's immense pressure and counter-force, yet they persisted in charging toward it.

At that moment, the entire Divine Ancient Gate echoed with thunderous sounds, like raindrops hitting the ground. In Luo Tian's ears, this sound was tens of thousands times louder than raindrops.

"One day... two days..."

Ten thousand cultivators continuously attacked, while more people chose to give up. They stood outside the Divine Ancient Gate, watching others enter one by one.

"Ten thousand..." Finally, ten thousand people remained outside, and Luo Tian was among them.

"The other eleven holders of the main tokens must have chosen the same approach—relying on their strength to enter the Divine Ancient Ruins. If I had revealed my token earlier, it would have surely drawn envy and even a scramble."

"There's no suspicious person here," Luo Tian's vast spiritual sense swept around, finding no one resembling a main token holder. He sighed and transformed into a seven-colored rainbow, rushing toward the golden Divine Ancient Gate.

"Seven-element体质 (elemental body)!"

"It's Luo Tian! He doesn't have a Divine Ancient Gate Token!" People exclaimed, gazing at the seven-colored rainbow radiating powerful fluctuations.

"Strong! This aura makes me feel tremble!" A man at the peak of Nascent Soul looked in awe at Luo Tian flying through the sky.

"Destroy Life!" As people sighed, Luo Tian's figure appeared before the Divine Ancient Gate. Sensing its rejection force, he displayed determination and launched a punch of "Destroy Life."

"Boom..." The sound that had been like raindrops hitting the ground now felt as if a stone had been thrown into a lake. An invisible fluctuation spread between Luo Tian and the Divine Ancient Gate, causing people around to stop their actions, their faces filled with disbelief.

"I'll go in first; you all continue!" Luo Tian smiled, addressing a young man who had been stunned.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian's words faded, a displacement force arose, and his figure vanished from people's sight.

The disturbance Luo Tian caused was only for an instant, and then people continued to attack the Divine Ancient Gate. Finally, on the fifteenth day, no one could enter the gate. The Divine Ancient Gate emitted thunderous sounds and vanished from people's sight, as if returning to the void.

Fifteen days passed; ten thousand cultivators had entered the Divine Ancient Gate, while several more thousands watched with envy as it disappeared. They sighed deeply and vanished in streaks of light, returning the world to silence.

...

The black space slowly closed, and at that moment, an old figure walked through the Southern Region. His face bore a solemn expression; his body slightly trembled, and his eyes deepened: "The seed of hope has been sown. Thus, the great battle is about to begin!"

This old man carried no fluctuations at all, appearing as an ordinary person. Yet people around him seemed unaware of his presence. Strangely, even those who wished to pass through him found their space twisted oddly.

If Luo Tian saw this old man now, he would recognize him as the old man who had made him reincarnate nine times—Yin Tianxiong, a legendary figure.

"Divine Ancient Gate Opens! The Moon Arrives!" In the depths of the Northern Region's Da'an Forest, the Southern Region's Ice Pole Island, and the Eastern Region's Kunlun Mountains, three old figures suddenly opened their eyes. Their faces bore bitter expressions.

These three elders were none other than Luo Tian's master, Zhang Daotian's three manifestations.

Within the toxic barriers of the Western Region, beneath the Tian Shi Sect's base, a withered old man—seeming like a corpse—slowly sat up. His crimson eyes opened.

With withered fingers, he pointed toward the sky. As the old man pointed, the entire Tianyuan Continent's sky seemed to darken. The moon, which should have appeared at night, suddenly rose in the dusk, shaped like a crescent.

Ordinary people on the Tianyuan Continent didn't notice this moon's anomaly, thinking it a natural spectacle.

Yang Huanyu sat cross-legged in the Tian Shi Sect's hall, his face cold. His body radiated powerful energy as he gazed at the crescent moon, a cold smile on his lips: "Think you can escape by entering the Divine Ancient Ruins? Dream on!"

As Yang Huanyu's words fell, his forehead cracked open. A crimson eye slowly opened. The eerie red light from Yang Huanyu's newly opened third eye shot into the sky, illuminating the crescent moon.

As red light descended, the crescent moon was veiled in a layer of red, appearing strangely eerie.

At that moment, the elders of all sects on the Tianyuan Continent suddenly opened their eyes. Their gazes were cold, looking toward the moon in the sky. Their bodies radiated overwhelming energy, emerging from their long-term seclusion to cause astonishment among sect disciples.

"Listen up, all disciples! From today on, prepare for battle at any moment. The protective array must be activated constantly. All disciples who have left should return immediately!" After the elders emerged from seclusion, most issued this command.

As these commands spread, sect disciples across the Tianyuan Continent returned to their sects. A tense atmosphere appeared in every corner of the continent, brought by the blood moon.

The only sect different was the Northern Region's Wuxing Sect. While no elders had emerged from seclusion, five peak elders stood at the underground depths of Wuxing Mountain.

"Clang... Clang..." In a stone chamber twenty thousand zhang underground in Wuxing Mountain, iron chains clanked.

Numerous seals covered the entire chamber, their powerful sealing energy evident. If a Nascent Soul cultivator saw this, they would be astonished at the strength of these seals—capable of sealing even a Nascent Soul powerhouse.

Five Wuxing Sect elders at the Nascent Soul level stood outside the chamber, their faces filled with anxiety as they gazed at the furry creature bound by iron chains and seals within.

The editor requested to save this draft, with three updates or two daily for about half a month, then an explosion.

Chapter 594: The Onset of War ()

Chapter 594: The Onset of War

"Roar..." A low growl echoed in the chamber. Two red lights made the elders' faces show sorrow.

"The war is about to begin, but our elder still hasn't recovered. The million-year foundation of Wuxing Sect might be destroyed in a moment!" Qingmu Peak's elder looked sorrowful, addressing his brothers.

"More than not recovering—look at this situation. With the blood moon's arrival, our elder is being more severely corrupted by that force!" Other elders also showed anxiety.

"Let's reinforce the seals, then. If we're careless and our elder breaks free, even with all of Wuxing Sect's strength, we can't stop him. Without Tian Shi Sect's help, Wuxing Sect will destroy itself!" Jin Guang Peak's elder spoke, sighing.

His words were met with nods from the others. Their hands secretively formed five long dragons, which flew around the chamber and finally landed on the stone chamber and the furry creature.

"Roar..." As the seals fell, the creature roared again. Its cold fangs emerged from its mouth, eyes filled with ferocity as it gazed at the five elders.

One hour... two hours... one day passed slowly, and the elders' faces were gradually covered in sweat.

"Kill me! I feel I can't control myself anymore!" As the seals fell again, a weak voice echoed in the chamber.

The furry creature opened its eyes, revealing clear glances toward the five peak elders. Its face was gentle.

At that moment, the creature's true form revealed itself. If any Wuxing Sect disciple saw this creature, they would never imagine that the sect's founder and million-year strength master was actually a monkey.

"I'd rather live in agony than bring disaster to Wuxing Sect!" Before the five peak elders could speak, the thin monkey spoke again.

"Elder, the blood moon has arrived; the war is about to begin! You must hold on!" The five elders, seeing the thin monkey's clarity, knelt and shouted.

"War... blood moon... Moon Arrival..." The monkey murmured, its eyes turning murky again. Finally, it roared loudly, slapping the ground with both hands, producing thunderous sounds.

"Alas..." The elders sighed, their faces bitter as they walked out of the chamber.

The disciples of Wuxing Sect were completely unaware of what happened two thousand zhang underground. Nearly a million disciples rushed toward Wuxing Sect, making the originally spacious mountain gradually crowded.

"Eventually, it has come! The beginning of the decline of the Gusu family!" Tian Bo's old face showed hatred, his gaze toward the blood moon.

...

However, people in the Divine Ancient Ruins, including Luo Tian, were unaware of the tense events that had occurred outside as they entered the Ruins.

As Luo Tian stepped into the Divine Ancient Gate, he felt a displacement force, vanishing from the entrance of the Ruins.

"Buzz..." The fluctuation spread; Luo Tian landed steadily on the ground, then his spiritual sense swept around, his gaze filled with vigilance.

"This..." As Luo Tian landed, he felt a profound aura of antiquity rushing toward him.

Luo Tian looked up, sensing the Divine Ancient Ruins were like another continent, stretching endlessly. Yet his current location had no signs of life.

Luo Tian gazed at the surroundings, first impression being desolate. The most shocking thing was the intense aura of combat, as if in a battlefield. He could imagine the battle's ferocity despite countless years.

"Where are the others?" Luo Tian murmured, taking out his Divine Ancient Gate Token, a look of confusion on his face.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian just took out the token, a powerful spiritual energy fluctuation echoed throughout the world. He felt his surroundings change rapidly.

The battlefield of combat seemed to return through endless years, as if returning to countless years ago or later. The dark sky gradually turned blue, and a clear aura replaced the intense combat atmosphere.

Luo Tian appeared in a forest, where dense spiritual energy made him feel his mind tremble. His gaze was filled with confusion as he looked around.

"Daotian, why are you still lingering? If you don't go, the Dan Zong's lecture will start. If you're late, Dan Zong will surely be angry again! Although you are Dan Zong's disciple, it's not good to skip class so often!" A voice woke Luo Tian up. Above him, several figures shouted at the dazed Luo Tian in the forest.

Luo Tian's confusion deepened, but then a series of memories appeared in his mind, making his gaze slightly tense.

Zhang Daotian, the Grand Elder of Tian Dao Sect's Dan Zong, had taken in an infant from the mountain thirty years ago and personally made him his only disciple!

"Zhang Daotian, this Divine Ancient Gate Token was given by my master. Does that mean I'm currently using my master's younger self?" Luo Tian murmured, his eyes gradually showing understanding. He now understood why his master had given him this token.

Tian Dao Sect was one of the top sects in the Divine Ancient Continent. Its disciples numbered countless, and its Grand Elder's strength was naturally profound. He had reached the Nascent Soul peak for countless years.

A series of memories made Luo Tian momentarily stunned, struggling to adapt. Then he felt the situation of his current identity slightly startled.

"An绝世天才 (exceptional genius), four-element body, a spoiled prodigy, bullying men and women, doing evil deeds. His strength is merely Nascent Soul peak!" Feeling the uniqueness of this identity, Luo Tian's mouth twitched.

Luo Tian looked up at the people above, a bitter smile on his face. In memories, these people were all disciples of the Grand Elder or offspring of the Grand Elder. The only thing they had in common was being spoiled—what is called "smelling the same."

Such a group, with the Grand Elder as their support, had high status in Tian Dao Sect. The highest-ranking disciples were the direct disciples of the elders. These direct disciples, in front of Zhang Daotian and the several young men above, were like ants. Though they couldn't be killed at will, if these few people wanted to, they could easily eliminate any disciple of Tian Dao Sect, even elders!

Chapter 595: The Tian Dao Sect ()

Chapter 595: The Tian Dao Sect

"If I've become another identity, others must have changed their identities too. With this identity, those Western Region people won't be my opponents. Once I find them, no matter who they are, their lives will be in my hands!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with determination. He now fully understood his identity.

"Buzz..." Four-color spiritual energy wings flew from Luo Tian's body, making him feel his mind tremble. He was now completely Zhang Daotian, even his spiritual energy had become four elements. The other three elements seemed suppressed by the world's rules, making them unusable.

"Master also was a four-element genius!" Luo Tian chuckled, then soared into the sky with Nascent Soul peak cultivation.

"In the Tianyuan Continent, Nascent Soul peak is perhaps among the top tier, but in this Divine Ancient Continent, it's merely middle-level. There are no commoners here; all are cultivators! This is the place for true cultivation!" Luo Tian sighed, a smile on his face as he flew toward the young men.

"Daotian, why do you look so strange? You're smiling less... some past猥琐 (sneaky behavior)?" The young men, also at Nascent Soul peak, looked at Luo Tian with strange expressions.

"Sneaky? Get lost! I'm so handsome, how could I be sneaky! Let's go; if we don't go now, we'll get scolded!" Luo Tian shouted at the young men, then flew toward a square plaza ahead.

The young men shook their heads, then looked at Luo Tian with concern as he flew toward the plaza.

Luo Tian led them through the sky, and every disciple of Tian Dao Sect who met them avoided them like avoiding a plague, not even daring to glance at them.

"Dao of Heaven and Earth, all things in nature have vitality. Taking this vitality to refine elixirs, refining elixirs can also be called refining the essence of herbs. Let the medicinal plants survive in another form through time..." An old voice echoed, and an elder sat high on a platform, his appearance refined.

Situ Chen, Grand Elder of Dan Zong in Tian Dao Sect, one of the nine Grand Elders of Tian Dao Sect. He gave a lecture every thousand years, and his lectures were always packed with attendees. Even elders and the Sect Master would come to listen.

Luo Tian led his group to the square filled with people, and as they landed, they immediately drew attention. Some even showed flattery, making space for themselves.

The other young men who came with Luo Tian naturally sat in their seats, and so did Luo Tian. This made him slightly startled at first, struggling to adapt.

"Alright... that's it for today!" After an hour, Situ Chen showed no emotion, his figure disappearing from the platform under the respectful gazes of disciples. However, he cast a deep glance at Luo Tian before leaving.

As Situ Chen left, the area around Luo Tian became a vacuum. Thunderous sounds echoed in the sky.

"Crack..." A golden lightning bolt struck Luo Tian's head, causing his body to tremble.

Luo Tian was no longer the one who had understood the truth of lightning element and feared thunderstorms. He was now Zhang Daotian, a four-element genius.

This strike made Luo Tian's mind tremble; his face turned pale, and his hair stood on end. The sky had countless chains binding him, and with the chains' arrival, his cultivation was instantly sealed.

This lightning strike was too fast and caught Luo Tian off guard during a moment of relaxation. He couldn't react in time, and even if he did, being bound by chains made him unable to resist.

"I'm not the Grand Elder's disciple, right? Why is this happening!" Luo Tian's mind shook. He was afraid—this lightning strike had already injured him severely. If there were another, he definitely couldn't withstand it.

As Luo Tian felt fear, another lightning bolt descended from the sky, striking his head. However, its power was slightly less than the first lightning bolt, as if sensing Luo Tian's condition.

This strike made Luo Tian spit blood; his face was pale as a sheet of paper. Amid the thunderous noise, he saw all Tian Dao Sect disciples looking at him with eyes filled with mockery. Hundreds of people had expressions of concern.

The other young men who came with Luo Tian looked anxious, gazing at the sky.

"Zhang Daotian, do you know your crime?" A thunderous voice echoed from the sky, causing all disciples to kneel. It was the Grand Elder's voice, and people felt that more than one Grand Elder was present.

"Grand Elder, it's not Zhang Daotian's fault! It was Ma Xiuran who tricked Luo Tian!" A young man shouted toward the sky.

"Yes, Grand Elder! It's not Zhang Daotian's fault!" Disciples with Dan Zong symbols on their sleeves shouted toward the sky. These people were those who had shown concern for Luo Tian earlier.

They were all disciples of Dan Zong, and they saw Zhang Daotian as their Grand Elder's disciple. In their eyes, although Luo Tian had become an adult, he was still a young man in his twenties. Compared to them, he was still a child.

"Daotian, don't force yourself; quickly admit your mistake! This time you've really messed up!"

"Yes, Daotian, you shouldn't have bet with Ma Xiuran and lost the Tian Dao Thunder Sword!" The other young men also looked anxious.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian was completely stunned, unsure of what mistake he had made to anger the Grand Elders of Tian Dao Sect.

As people explained, Luo Tian finally remembered. Zhang Daotian had committed so many foolish acts over the years that he was known as Tian Dao Sect's first troublemaker. This was because his master, Situ Chen, was a Grand Elder of Dan Zong and one of the most influential elders in Tian Dao Sect. He loved Zhang Daotian dearly, constantly covering up his mistakes and making amends for him.

Until a few days ago, Luo Tian had bet with Ma Xiujie from the Dark God Sect. He had lost the sect's sacred treasure, the Tian Dao Thunder Sword, to Ma Xiujie. Based on his own principles of honor, Zhang Daotian had secretly taken the Tian Dao Thunder Sword and delivered it to Ma Xiujie.

The Tian Dao Thunder Sword was a symbol of Tian Dao Sect. This matter was so significant that Zhang Daotian's action could be said to have pierced the heavens. Even his master, Situ Chen, had to lower his dignity and pay a great price to resolve this matter.

Chapter 596: Admitting Fault ()

Chapter 596: Admitting Fault

After Situ Chen suppressed this matter, the Grand Elders set a minimum requirement: Zhang Daotian must admit his mistake in front of everyone.

Though it was just admitting a mistake, people in Tian Dao Sect knew that Zhang Daotian had never spoken an apology since he grew up. Not even before Situ Chen did he ever lower his head to admit a mistake.

Numerous Dan Zong disciples flew toward the square, their faces filled with anxiety as they shouted at Luo Tian: "Daotian, quickly admit your mistake! This matter is over. If you don't admit it, the next lightning won't be able to withstand!"

Hearing their words, Luo Tian smiled bitterly. He understood his master's intention and then fixed his gaze with determination.

Seeing Luo Tian's gaze, all Dan Zong disciples showed bitterness, knowing that getting Zhang Daotian to admit his mistake would be tough.

"Admitting fault is impossible. However, I'll take responsibility for my own mess. Please Grand Elder give me half a year. Within six months, I'll retrieve the Tian Dao Thunder Sword from Ma Xiujie!" Though bound by chains, Luo Tian's eyes were resolute as he gazed at the sky.

"Boom..." Luo Tian's words caused a stir among the crowd, making everyone's faces show disbelief.

Even those纨绔 (spoiled) disciples looked at Luo Tian in shock, as if seeing a monster.

Ma Xiujie, the prodigy of the Dark God Sect, was at Soul Offering mid-stage. His strength was renowned across the Divine Ancient Continent, suppressing young talents to their knees.

Luo Tian was merely at Nascent Soul peak. He had previously been tricked by a disciple of the Dark God Sect into a match, losing the Tian Dao Thunder Sword. It wasn't a real fight with Ma Xiujie.

Although Luo Tian was a four-element genius, he had wasted years on frivolity. His Nascent Soul peak cultivation was entirely due to Dan Zong's vast resources and Situ Chen's forceful enhancement. They were not on the same level.

Not only did disciples stare in shock, but even the spiritual hand凝聚 (concentrated) from the sky paused momentarily.

Situ Chen had been seated in the void, not leaving. Upon hearing Luo Tian's resolute words, his eyes widened slightly, and his gaze toward Luo Tian changed.

"Do you confirm? If you can't do it, you know the consequences!" A voice echoed from the sky, carrying immense pressure toward Luo Tian.

"Confirmed!" Luo Tian's voice carried determination, his eyes glowing with endless light.

"Good. Elder Three, you've heard it. If this boy can't do it, don't blame us for not giving him any favor!" The voice thundered across the entire Tian Dao Mountain.

"Buzz..." A displacement force rose from Luo Tian's feet, and his figure vanished under the astonished gazes of people.

Seeing Luo Tian disappear, except for Dan Zong disciples, others in other sects smiled coldly but dared not show it.

Yet someone couldn't hold back, laughing out loud and looking at the sky with disdain.

"Come here, you three!" The voice had just been heard when those Grand Elders' disciples found them and approached with hostile expressions.

...

"Buzz..." Luo Tian felt a dizzy spell, and in the next moment, he was displaced to a cave.

Situ Chen sat on a cushion, his eyes flashing disappointment and complexity before turning stern as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"Master!" Luo Tian didn't dare to be disrespectful, standing respectfully as he awaited Situ Chen's scolding.

"Does it hurt?" Situ Chen's face showed a touch of concern as he looked at Luo Tian.

Situ Chen had no children in his life, dedicating himself entirely to cultivation and elixir refining. This was how he achieved his legendary fame in the Divine Ancient Continent. Zhang Daotian had been an orphan Situ Chen found, and he felt compassion, taking him as his only disciple.

This adoption was no small matter; Situ Chen discovered Luo Tian's four-element body and completely loved this little kid, treating him like his own son.

But Zhang Daotian had been mischievous since he could remember, breaking Situ Chen's heart. Yet he still spoiled him.

Luo Tian's words at the square had completely disappointed Situ Chen, but his resolute gaze made Situ Chen feel a change in his disciple.

Seeing Situ Chen's scrutinizing gaze, Luo Tian felt nervous, fearing he might reveal a flaw before the Grand Elder at Nascent Soul peak—only one step away from becoming a World Lord.

"Painful!" Luo Tian nodded carefully, lifting his head as if he had done something wrong.

"You know it hurts! Don't play this with me!" Situ Chen was amused by Luo Tian's careful demeanor, sighing inwardly. Zhang Daotian had indeed been spoiled by him.

"Ugh... stop playing around, Daotian. With your talent, you can definitely catch up with Ma Xiujie. Learn the techniques and martial arts I taught you properly, okay? You just said half a year to retrieve the Tian Dao Thunder Sword. How can you do that?" Situ Chen was both angry and furious, but his indulgence was even greater.

"Show me the techniques and martial arts I taught you!" Situ Chen sighed lightly.
