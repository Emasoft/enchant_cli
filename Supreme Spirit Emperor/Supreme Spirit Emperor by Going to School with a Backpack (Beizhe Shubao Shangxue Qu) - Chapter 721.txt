“Damn it!” Luo Li muttered under his breath. But at this moment, he had no choice but to grit his teeth and struggle through the void. He discovered that even with his cultivation as an Epoch Master, he could not tear through this space; he could only seek out weak points in the void to attempt passage.

The Endless Invasion had turned two starfields blood-red. No matter one's cultivation, none could escape death. After colliding for an entire day, the entire starfield had turned blood-red, and both starfields were annihilated in this collision.

Chapter 2728: The World Changes

Under the blood-red starry sky, Gu Tianyu and Man Wang stood beneath the stars, gazing at the bloodstained heavens. Both were momentarily stunned.

The scene was breathtaking—countless beings perished in the collision, and though they had saved many, it was but a fraction. Gu Tianyu and Man Wang had lived for eons and witnessed many scenes, yet even as Immortal Kings at their peak, they felt stunned.

*Buzz...*

As the two stood in awe, a powerful and domineering force struck them, pushing them toward the Immortal Realm.

World Barrier!

Gu Tianyu and Man Wang's eyes narrowed slightly, but their bodies were propelled into the void. Before leaving, they saw a golden divine light rising from beneath the starry sky.

As soon as they entered the void, they felt a repelling force from the Immortal Realm striking their bodies.

One before the other, two forces pressed upon them, making Man Wang's face darken.

"Surely it's because we brought too many people. The Immortal Realm's rules don't allow it!" Man Wang spoke, his blood energy surging as he resisted the Immortal Realm's rule force.

"Regardless of anything, we must get these people to the Immortal Realm!" Gu Tianyu's eyes flashed with determination. His golden divine sword radiated a brilliant light, and his aura surged.

"I've lost once before. I won't lose this time!" Gu Tianyu coldly spoke, brandishing his golden sword and slashing into the void.

*Crack...*

The sword's radiance shattered, as if crushed by an unseen force. It exploded tens of feet away from Gu Tianyu, and both he and Man Wang were pushed forward by ten feet.

"Ha! I'll join you!" Man Wang laughed heartily, launching a flurry of punches. Each punch caused the void to tremble.

If someone were in the void and saw their actions, they would be stunned. For they were challenging the Immortal Realm's rule force itself. Rules were rules—no one could defy them—but these two dared to challenge the laws.

...

While Gu Tianyu and Man Wang struggled against the rules, pushing toward the Immortal Realm, the heavens of the Central Three Realms, which had roared for a day, finally calmed.

All forces within the Central Three Realms, even those in the Upper and Hellish realms, were stirred. This event was far more intense than before.

The heavens of the Central Three Realms were riddled with cracks, as if one could see the entire sky of the Central Three Realms, like a mirror about to shatter.

For all in the Central Three Realms, this day was filled with fear and dread, as if the sky would collapse at any moment.

Occasionally, massive cracks spewed large stones, like a meteor shower.

*Boom...* A piece of debris struck the barrier of Tianyuan Sect, producing a dull sound. The barrier vanished, and Luo Tian and his group emerged onto Tianyuan Mountain, gazing at the somewhat ruined ground.

Bodies!

Suddenly, Luo Tian and his group saw two corpses lying at the foot of Tianyuan Mountain.

"Saint's Realm!" Though they were corpses, Luo Tian and his group could still discern their cultivation.

"Indeed, it's the Nine Realms. It seems this has ended. But why haven't Gu Zǔ and others returned?" The group soon became anxious, as colliding with the Immortal Realm was an event too terrifying. Even Immortal Kings at their peak could face danger.

While Luo Tian and his group anxiously waited, the heavens of the Immortal Realm also trembled.

"Sky! It's changed!" Bütian Xianwang's face darkened, muttering lowly as if sensing a change.

"Entry into the Central Three Realms is now unrestricted!" Yongsheng Xianwang stood on Yongsheng Mountain, sensing the Upper Three Realms' rules had also changed due to this collision.

"Damn it! We just sealed the heavens, and now they've been broken. Even Immortal Kings at their peak can enter the Upper and Central Realms!"

"Thankfully, Hell's attack on Tianyuan Sect caused heavy damage. Otherwise, if Hell continued to attack the Upper Realms, the consequences would have been unimaginable!" The Upper Realms were in chaos. No one expected such a sudden change.

"World Heart!" However, after the chaos, several peak Immortal Kings set their sights on the World Heart.

Back then, the collision wasn't as large. Still, a World Heart had appeared. This time, with such a massive collision and even the Immortal Realm's rules affected, the peak Immortal Kings immediately deduced that there was an 80% chance a World Heart would appear. The Immortal Realm's rules were chaotic, the Nine Heavens interconnected, and Hell might attack the Upper Realms at any time. That would be a decisive battle. A World Heart, though not yet evolved into a World Treasure, was still an important treasure that could increase the Immortal Realm's chances of victory.

Several peak Immortal Kings rose, vanishing from their respective immortal mountains to seek out the entrance to the outer realms. The World Heart was something they would surely fight over.

Not only did the peak Immortal Kings of the Immortal Realm move, but also the Ten Judges of Hell. They too were determined to seize the World Heart.

"Change is coming. It's time!" Yang Huanyu stood in a dim hall, his gaze deep.

"Three of you go to find the entrance to the outer realms. The rest, prepare to seize the Tai Ping Palace!" Yang Huanyu addressed others in the hall.

"Yes! Yes!" Excited voices echoed. The people in the hall began to move.

At once, both the Immortal Realm and Hell were in turmoil. Everyone knew of another collision between a small realm and the Immortal Realm.

"A World Heart! I wonder who will claim it this time. Last time, Luo Tian got lucky. This time, more people will surely come!" Everyone shifted their attention from the strength of Tianyuan Sect to this collision between a small realm and the Immortal Realm.

However, Tianyuan Sect's people were anxiously waiting for Gu Tianyu and Man Wang to return. Three days passed, but the two still hadn't appeared.

"Did Gu Zǔ and others just return?" Diao Dezhu and the others speculated day after day.

"No!" Luo Tian shook his head. His condition wasn't great, but he had been waiting for three days.

Time passed. Another three days went by, and two weary figures finally appeared at the entrance of Tianyuan Sect. Luo Tian's group was overjoyed—there was no one else but Gu Tianyu and Man Wang.

"This time, I've won!" Gu Tianyu gazed at the shattered heavens, as if speaking to someone.

"Grandmaster Gu, what's wrong?" Luo Tian and his group looked at Gu Tianyu and Man Wang. Both were covered in blood, their energy weak, with many wounds as if they had fought a life-or-death battle.

"Nothing. Move aside!" Gu Tianyu responded while raising his hand, sending out a wave of energy. Instantly, numerous figures appeared in the sight of Luo Tian and his group.

Ten... a hundred... ten thousand...

Each figure was bewildered, some still in certain postures. They looked around and saw many friends beside them.

"What's going on? Where am I?" A series of confused voices echoed. But seeing these people, Luo Tian's group was stunned.

Chapter 2729: Longing to Meet

"What's going on? I feel like I've become younger!" A series of exclamations echoed. Many people looked at themselves, feeling no longer old.

"This..." Seeing these people, Luo Tian's group was momentarily stunned before their eyes widened in disbelief.

"Luo Tian!" A voice echoed, and the scene fell silent. Luo Tian and Diao Dezhu looked at the people of Tianyuan Continent, who in turn gazed at Luo Tian and his group. They stared at each other wide-eyed.

"I..." Luo Tian looked at three elderly figures among the crowd, his voice choked with emotion as he stepped toward them and fell to his knees.

"Grandfather, Father, Mother!" Luo Tian shouted, voice filled with excitement as he looked at the three.

Time passed. Luonantian and his wife, along with Luo Xiong, had aged. They had lived for millions of years and were considered quite long-lived. Even in the Immortal Realm, they were elderly due to its rules.

"Tiān'er!" Luonantian's eyes widened. His aged eyes still couldn't believe it, raising his hand and gazing at Luo Tian.

"Am I not dreaming?" Luonantian's wife looked at Luo Tian, gently touching his head.

"Gu Lei, you bastard! How old have you become!" Diao Dezhu laughed heartily, looking at an elderly man among the crowd.

"Gods! Doggy, tomb raiding, War Spear..." The old man suddenly bellowed and took a step toward Diao Dezhu, laughing heartily.

"If it's a dream, then let it be! Ha ha! You bastards have been millions of years without coming to see me. I almost got killed!" Gu Lei laughed heartily, hugging Diao Dezhu and others.

"Damn it! Who dares to hit you? I'll kill him!" Diao Dezhu cursed, slapping Gu Lei's back hard.

*Crack...*

A brittle sound echoed. Gu Lei's back collapsed at a terrifying speed, blood spewing from his mouth.

"You..." Gu Lei's eyes widened in shock. Due to the change of rules in the Nine Realms, he had entered the Heavens' Path. But even as a Heavens' Path cultivator, he couldn't withstand an Immortal King's slap.

"Um... I didn't use much strength!" Diao Dezhu shouted, shrinking his head. He hadn't expected Gu Lei to be so fragile.

However, Diao Dezhu's eyes then lit up. He looked at Gu Lei being treated by Runhongyu, seemingly finding future amusement.

*Cough cough...*

"Gu Lei, as a senior, I have the duty to guide you. When facing strong opponents, one must maintain respect. Now, your status is so low that you don't even have the qualification to tie my shoes!" Diao Dezhu coughed twice, his aura gradually spreading. The people of the Tianyuan Continent were instantly stunned.

*Smack...*

Before three breaths could pass, a large hand suddenly descended and smashed Diao Dezhu into the ground.

"Running to show off here!" Zhang Chenglong cursed loudly.

"You guys..." Gu Lei and others' eyes were filled with shock. It felt too real to be a dream.

Only one person, after being shocked, became calm and gazed at Luo Tian's group. His eyes flashed with a glint.

"You're not dreaming. You are now in the Immortal Realm!" Luo Tian spoke, gazing at Gu Tianyu and Man Wang. His eyes held sorrow.

The noisy Diao Dezhu group fell silent, seemingly understanding something. The two small realms that had collided with the Immortal Realm were the Nine Realms!

"Is this all that's left?" Luo Tian's eyes swept through the crowd, searching for his bloodline.

"Where are Luo Li and Xiting?" Luo Tian asked, looking at the two hundred thousand people brought by Gu Tianyu and Man Wang. But he didn't see Luo Li or Luo Xiting.

"The collision was too fast. We could only save as many as possible!" Gu Tianyu spoke, both of them hadn't had time to care who was who. They just focused on saving people.

"Lost... lost..." Luo Tian was stunned. He could feel that among these people, many were related to him, but not the purest.

"What's wrong, Tiān'er?" Luo Xiong and others looked at Luo Tian with confusion. They had just been filled with joy, but a bad feeling arose in their hearts.

"My son!" Jiang Sxi and Gu Qianxue shouted. At this moment, Jiang Sxi no longer had the authority of Tianyuan Sect's sect leader. Her voice was filled with pain.

"Luo Tian, where is my son?" Jiang Sxi and Gu Qianxue approached Luo Tian. The three were stunned.

"The Nine Realms are gone..."

"You people are the survivors of the Nine Realms!" Gu Tianyu spoke, and the air stilled.

"Impossible!"

"Several noble families, several starfields. How could they just vanish!" The people of the Nine Realms exclaimed in disbelief.

Gu Lei and others were also stunned, as if struck by lightning. Their children weren't there either. They had gone with Luo Li and others to the Divine Beast Ancient Cave, seeking a way into the Immortal Realm.

"Maybe they're not dead. I saved these people, but many others didn't die. They've scattered into the Immortal Realm!" Gu Tianyu spoke, gazing at the stunned crowd.

"Yes! Xiaozi is a Void Body. He's most skilled in survival. He couldn't have died!" Gu Lei shouted, his eyes gradually regaining their spark.

Tianyuan Sect was once again filled with sorrow. After years of development, the Tianyuan Sect of the Nine Realms had become prosperous, with hundreds of millions. Now it was reduced to just two hundred thousand people.

Who didn't have relatives or friends? Now they were all annihilated. And the Nine Realms, which had existed for millions of years, were gone. There was no home, no place to return.

"Alright, we have Tianyuan Sect in the Immortal Realm!" Luo Tian stood up. He knew that now was the time for these people to rise.

"Those who are alive must continue living!" Luo Tian spoke, his gaze sweeping over the people of the Nine Realms. Finally, he focused on Jiang Nanxuan.

"Everyone, settle these people down!" Jiang Sxi suppressed her sorrow and addressed the people of Tianyuan Sect in the Immortal Realm.

"Yes!" The group obeyed, their eyes filled with sympathy. They had experienced similar events during the battle against Hell.

"Come on, brothers!"

"It'll be over soon!" The people of Tianyuan Sect in the Immortal Realm continuously comforted those from the Nine Realms, beginning to settle them down.

Chapter 2730: Turmoil

Time passed. It took a full month for the people of the Nine Realms to fully settle in Tianyuan Sect in the Immortal Realm. They gradually adapted to life there. During this month, Hell and the Immortal Realm were in turmoil. The Judges of Hell and the masters of immortal mountains searched for the weakest points to enter the outer realms. Without the constraints of rule forces, several peak Immortal Kings occasionally met and even fought, but there were no casualties in the end.

After a month of searching, people finally found the weak points of small realms within the Huantian Sea.

"Still there are world barriers, but this time it's much better. Peak Immortal Kings can enter at the middle stage."

At once, Hell and the Immortal Realm's strong forces rushed into Huantian Sea. Each of their respective lords had given them a death order: to seize the World Heart.

"This time, Hell and the Immortal Realm can unite against each other. But once we've eliminated the Immortal Realm's people, it'll be a fight among ourselves!" Nine judges exchanged words and reminded those who went to the outer realms of their final limits.

The Immortal Realm was also like this. Regardless, they were a single faction. The main enemy hadn't been resolved yet; internal fighting was not suitable.

Storms arose, and all strong forces rushed toward Huantian Sea. However, since the war between Hell and the Immortal Realm had begun, Huantian Sea remained neutral. To enter Huantian Sea, one needed the approval of its three masters.

Huantian Sea was vast. Neither Hell nor the Immortal Realm wanted to offend this force, so they reached an agreement with Huantian Sea's people.

While strong forces rushed toward Huantian Sea, in Tianyuan Sect's council hall, Luo Tian and others discussed the matter of the World Heart.

With Jiang Nanxuan and Gu Lei joining, the council hall was filled with people.

Jiang Sxi handed over the sect leader position to Jiang Nanxuan, knowing no one was more suitable for it. Jiang Nanxuan had once been the brain of Tianyuan Sect.

Back then, if it hadn't been for Jiang Nanxuan managing Tianyuan Sect, it wouldn't have developed so well. Although the people of the Nine Realms weren't very strong now, Luo Tian and others believed that with enough time, these people would be limitless. After all, they had lived for so long. If their time in the Nine Realms was counted in the Immortal Realm, they were all old monsters.

"Does the Nine Realms have a World Heart? Even if it does, it's ours. Let's take this opportunity to see if there are any survivors in the Nine Realms!" Nan Gong Yuqing spoke.

"Exactly. It belongs to our Nine Realms. We must fight for it!" Others also agreed. Now they had the qualifications to compete with Hell and the Immortal Realm.

"Also, we've sent out messages. It's Luo Tian who established Tianyuan Sect. Even if the people of the Nine Realms fell into Hell and the Immortal Realm, they would surely associate it with Luo Tian's legend!"

"Send a message to the Ten Judges of Hell and the Nine Immortal Mountains. If anyone dares to harm a single person from Tianyuan Sect, we'll kill ten of them!" Luo Tian spoke. His greatest fear was that people from the Nine Realms who had survived would be captured by Hell and the Immortal Realm.

Luo Tian was grateful. After countless hardships, he had lifted Tianyuan Sect. Otherwise, this disaster would have left the people of the Nine Realms without a home.

"Who should handle the people from Yongyang Realm?" After that, everyone's eyes turned to a few people bound in the hall.

Their cultivation was very high for the small realms. There were even two or three Epoch Masters. Without the cultivation of an Epoch Master, one couldn't match the Nine Realms.

At that time, Gu Tianyu and Man Wang hadn't looked at people carefully. They had just grabbed anyone they could, so they had also taken many from the Yongyang Realm.

"Let them go. These years we've formed a bond. Actually, our two realms have been at peace for a long time. There were just some minor conflicts!" Gu Lei spoke, gazing at one of the Epoch Masters bound.

"Who asked you to let me go? If you have the courage, kill me. Otherwise, I owe you a favor. Chen Hebi has never owed anyone anything!" The bound Epoch Master shouted, his voice loud and matching Gu Lei's.

"Chen Hebi, why are you so stubborn?"

"We've fought for millions of years. Now the Nine Realms and Yongyang Realm are gone. What's left? Do you think this is still the Nine Realms? In the Immortal Realm, we're all ants. What's there to fight for!" Gu Lei responded, making the few people from Yongyang Realm in the hall fall silent.

"Fine. We'll join Tianyuan Sect. I never thought we'd lose after fighting for so long!" After a silence, Chen Hebi sighed.

"Master Jiang, what's your opinion?" Luo Tian's eyes showed a hint of joy. This was the first time in many days that Luo Tian had smiled.

"I need to understand some things. But you're right. We must seize the World Heart of the Nine Realms. Compared to Hell and the Immortal Realm, Tianyuan Sect is still quite weak!" Jiang Nanxuan replied.

"Who will go?" Jiang Nanxuan spoke, gazing at Luo Tian and others. Now the people of the Tianyuan Continent couldn't go.

"I'll go. My cultivation has just recovered to the middle stage of Immortal King!"

"Inside, I've restored it. I used the Hundred Ghosts Seal to suppress my cultivation!" Luo Tian spoke.

"I'll go too. I also want to see what the Nine Realms look like now..." As Luo Tian's words finished, others shouted loudly.

"Diao Dezhu, Zhan Biao, Sun Keinian, Si Ma Tuo, Wan Lingkong, Yao Chen!" Luo Tian called out the names of several people. He knew they were all sharp-witted and decided immediately. Chen Zhanbiao and Yao Chen were very strong.

"Alright, Tianyuan Sect also needs to be built. You all stay behind!" Luo Tian noticed some people's dissatisfaction and smiled lightly.

The crowd dispersed, but Luo Tian remained. Only he and Jiang Nanxuan were left in the hall.

"I have a plan!" Jiang Nanxuan rubbed his forehead and spoke to Luo Tian.

"What's the plan?" Jiang Nanxuan had already given him a glance earlier. Luo Tian understood.

"Let's do it big!" Jiang Nanxuan's eyes showed rare determination, no longer the calm demeanor he usually had.

"Let's incorporate the entire Central Three Realms into Tianyuan Sect!"

"Hell won't have time to care about us. The Immortal Realm won't dare to move against us. They all know Tianyuan Sect is a tough nut to crack. If anyone dares to attack Tianyuan Sect, they'll definitely suffer a major injury and give the opponent an opportunity. Why not seize this chance to rise with Hell and the Immortal Realm, dividing the world!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke, which made Luo Tian slightly stunned.

"Dividing the world!" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed. He had never thought of fighting for the world, just wanted a peaceful place for Tianyuan Sect.

"Tell me more!" But Luo Tian knew that only if the sect was strong enough could he live the life he wanted. Like when he had once unified the Nine Realms of Tianyuan Continent. At that time, Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan kept discussing the future path of Tianyuan Sect. Luo Tian carefully recounted all the events that had happened over the years to Jiang Nanxuan.

Chapter 2731: Zhu Jiuin

The next day, Luo Tian and Diao Dezhu rushed out of Tianyuan Sect toward Huantian Sea.

"We seem to have come a bit late," Luo Tian sighed. They had received intelligence that many people had already entered Huantian Sea.

"Relax, it's not late. Fuxingyue has been flirting with the princess of the Fish People for a long time, and they haven't stopped. He said that Huantian Sea Palace has sealed it, waiting for Hell and the Immortal Realm's people to arrive before opening," Wan Lingkong spoke.

The group didn't rush. After flying for three days, they arrived at the Huantian Sea coast. An endless coastline with vast waves.

*Crash...*

The waves rolled, and a massive creature appeared before Luo Tian's group. A shark over a thousand feet long stopped in front of them, its two rows of sharp teeth radiating cold light.

"Good day. Tiger Shark has come to escort you to Huantian Sea Palace at the command of the Fish People's leader!" The giant shark spoke, making Luo Tian and his group slightly stunned.

"Thank you," Luo Tian didn't hesitate. He landed on the tiger shark's back.

The strong body shot through the waves like an arrow, heading toward the depths of Huantian Sea.

...

Huantian Sea Palace, the sacred site of Huantian Sea. Located at the center of Huantian Sea, it was guarded by three peak forces. It could be said that almost infinite Huantian Sea was under their control.

The area of Huantian Sea was unknown, and the palace itself had stood for countless years. The three peak forces were not the first generation of Huantian Sea Palace's masters.

If the power of Huantian Sea was brought to the surface, it would exceed the numbers of Hell and the Immortal Realm. Because every fish in the sea was under Huantian Sea's jurisdiction.

Undoubtedly a dominant force. Even the Ten Judges of Hell and the peak forces of several immortal mountains had to respect Huantian Sea Palace's three masters. As long as one was in Huantian Sea, dragons had to coil and tigers had to lie down.

The massive palace floated on the blue sea, although it was daytime, it still gave a sense of authority. Divine light radiated.

The entire palace was jade-colored, as if carved from a block of tens of thousands of feet of jade. Just this palace was priceless.

But the sky above, which should have been a pale blue, had cracked open like a knife slicing through it.

In the palace, countless halls connected together. In the central hall, many figures sat there. On a jade table were various delicacies and wine.

But even with these delicacies and wine, the atmosphere in the hall was tense. Two groups sat opposite each other, gazing at each other with hatred.

One group wore black robes, their aura sinister. However, the patterns on their robes were different. A young man with a white long sword strapped to his back stood at the front, radiating cold light. He was Ye Qiu.

Next to Ye Qiu sat Wang Xiu and others, their eyes fixed on the Immortal Realm's people.

The Immortal Realm group also had several saint sons. Luo Tian was familiar with both groups. Each saint son had two people standing behind them like bodyguards, who were also elites.

Hell and the Immortal Realm naturally had no common ground. The Immortal Realm people's eyes were almost on fire, but the Hell saint sons' cold gazes held disdain.

"Senior, everyone has arrived. When can we enter?" Ye Qiu spoke without acknowledging the Immortal Realm people's fiery eyes.

"Wait a bit longer. Not everyone has arrived yet!" An old man sat in the center, his eyes smiling. This old man's presence made the saint sons dare not move. His power and status were clearly high.

Huantian Sea Palace's three masters, Zhu Jiuin, an Immortal King at his peak.

"Who else is coming? Are there still others?" Hearing Zhu Jiuin's words, the crowd showed impatience but dared not say anything.

Their elders had warned them before coming. They mustn't provoke Huantian Sea people, and even try to gain their favor because they were a major support.

"Senior, this time Hell has brought one thousand King-level ghost pills. Please accept them!" Ye Qiu spoke, standing up and walking toward Zhu Jiuin with respect. He handed over a storage ring to Zhu Jiuin.

"King-level ghost pills..." Hearing Ye Qiu's words, the Immortal Realm people's faces changed instantly.

Ghost pills were things formed after a ghost died. Like the inner core of fierce beasts, they could be refined and absorbed to directly increase one's cultivation. They were definitely good for cultivation. King-level ghost pills were even more so, representing the life force of a King-level ghost. They were extremely rare. Whether it was ghosts or fierce beasts, if they were killed forcefully, it was hard to form ghost pills and inner cores. Only natural deaths could form them.

Therefore, this item was extremely rare. One thousand King-level ghost pills were a major gesture. Even the Ten Judges of Hell had pooled together to get them.

"Thank you," Zhu Jiuin's eyebrows slightly lifted, taking the storage ring and smiling.

"Don't you think it's a small territory?" Wu Xingwen said with disdain, looking at the Immortal Realm saint sons.

"Rubbish. We're not Hell. So poor, but just because we won once, you've got your tail up? You were beaten by a small Tianyuan Sect and lost one of your masters..." The Immortal Realm people, hearing Hell's words, immediately refuted.

"You're looking for death!" Ye Qiu and others' faces darkened. The war a few months ago was still an open wound for Hell, and the Immortal Realm people's words were clearly rubbing salt into it.

"You've lost your Central Three Realms..."

"You've been killed by Tianyuan Sect hundreds of thousands of times!"

"Luo Tian was once a saint son of the Wheel Rotation Palace!"

"You've been killed by Tianyuan Sect four Immortal Kings at their peak and two saint sons!" The two groups' tension grew. No matter how Hell provoked, the Immortal Realm people only replied with this one fact.

But no matter how both sides argued, they were waiting for the other to strike first. Once the other struck, Zhu Jiuin wouldn't ignore it.

Zhu Jiuin didn't care about the two groups' arguments, but his eyes flashed with a hint of annoyance.

Time passed slowly. After arguing for half a day, both sides were tired. Zhu Jiuin also didn't show any intention of letting them leave and enter the void rift.

"Senior, this is a small gesture from our several immortal mountains. Please accept it!" A young man stood up, stepping toward Zhu Jiuin and handing over a storage ring.

"Thank you," Zhu Jiuin took it without hesitation. He knew both sides were thinking about what.

"Xuantian Sect, Luo Tian has arrived!" Just as the young man handed over the storage ring to Zhu Jiuin, a loud shout echoed through the hall. Zhu Jiuin's eyes showed a hint of joy.

Chapter 2732: Void Flame

"Ruo Tian?" Hearing this shout, the people in the hall were stunned. Their eyes all turned to the entrance of the hall.

Luo Tian and his group entered the palace, gazing at the people from Hell and the Immortal Realm. They weren't surprised because the Fish People's leader had told them both groups were there.

Luo Tian's eyes flashed with a hint of killing intent. He gazed at the people from Hell, clenching his fists briefly before flashing a smile.

"Everyone, it's been a long time!" Luo Tian greeted both groups. He mostly knew them, with only a few seeming like new saint sons he couldn't recognize.

"Damn it! How could it be him!" Seeing Luo Tian, both sides' faces darkened.

In recent times, who didn't know about Luo Tian? His sudden appearance gave them a great sense of crisis. Not just Hell, but the Immortal Realm as well.

"His only advantage is in small realms. Both are at the middle stage of Immortal King, and Luo Tian seems to still have injuries from the last battle!" The Immortal Realm and Hell people whispered, discussing among themselves.

*Buzz...*

As the two groups conversed, Zhu Jiuin opened the storage ring. A wave of energy spread, drawing everyone's attention to him.

Immortal energy surrounded it. Dozens of treasures appeared around Zhu Jiuin, radiating powerful waves.

"Ten upper-grade immortal weapons and forty middle-grade immortal weapons. Please accept them, Master Zhu!" The young man spoke, smiling.

"Thank you," Zhu Jiuin took the weapons without hesitation. His eyes were on Luo Tian.

"Indeed, a young man of talent!" Zhu Jiuin sighed, gazing at Luo Tian with kindness.

"Flattery!"

"We hadn't seen Zhu Jiuin show favor before!" Seeing Zhu Jiuin proactively speaking to Luo Tian, both Hell and the Immortal Realm people felt uneasy.

Who were they? Representatives of two factions. But Zhu Jiuin was showing favor to Tianyuan Sect, clearly not considering them.

"Luo Tian, it's been a long time!" A person from the Immortal Realm stepped forward with a smile and approached Luo Tian.

Jiang Yichen, a saint son of the Bütian Mountain. He was also one of Bütian Xianwang's sons. Luo Tian's old friend.

"Jiang Brother, it's been a long time. Your charm remains!" They clasped fists, their faces full of emotion. The boy from before had grown into a powerful figure, now controlling the lives and deaths of many.

"Big Brother Tian!" Two people who had stood behind Jiang Yichen stepped forward, their faces filled with joy. They approached Luo Tian and one of them immediately hugged him.

"Sorry, Big Brother Tian! The Upper Three Realms were sealed. We couldn't go down!" A voice of regret echoed. These two were Ye Liangchen and Ye Chen.

"Sorry," Ye Chen also spoke, though not as exaggerated as Ye Liangchen. But he was full of regret.

"Don't be sorry, we're all family!" Luo Tian spoke to Ye Liangchen and Ye Chen. His heart warmed.

When Hell attacked the Immortal Realm, Xinghe Fu had been directly brought into the Upper Three Realms by Bütian Xianwang and merged with Bütian Mountain. Therefore, the strength of Xinghe Fu was well preserved.

"Good brother! Let's have a drink later!" Luo Tian patted Ye Liangchen's shoulder and bowed to Zhu Jiuin.

"Some things delayed the time. Please forgive me, Master!" Luo Tian spoke to Zhu Jiuin with respect.

"Don't be polite. Sit down!" Zhu Jiuin didn't care much and waved to the people of Huantian Sea Palace waiting outside, who brought seats.

Luo Tian and his group sat down immediately. The table was full, making Chen Zhanbiao's mouth water.

"Eat!" Luo Tian saw Chen Zhanbiao's look and let him start eating.

"I'm really hungry, ha!" Chen Zhanbiao laughed heartily and started grabbing the food on the table.

"Zhanbiao, you bastard! Slow down and leave some for us!" Seeing Chen Zhanbiao start eating, Diao Dezhu and others weren't oil-savers. They immediately sat down and started eating heartily.

"Come on, Liangchen Brother! It's been a long time. Have a drink!" Sun Keinian and others pulled Jiang Yichen, Ye Liangchen, and Ye Chen to sit down. The group ate heartily as if they hadn't seen Hell and the Immortal Realm people.

"Ha! It's really a country bumpkin. Never seen the world before!" The Immortal Realm people had disdain on their faces.

"Uncle Luo, what gift did you bring to Huantian Sea Palace?" Wang Xiu spoke to Luo Tian. This made Diao Dezhu and others put down their chopsticks.

"Who's talking nonsense? So stinky! It's affecting my appetite!" Diao Dezhu coldly spoke, continuously fanning his nose.

Although Wang Xiu seemed casual, it was clearly trying to make Tianyuan Sect uncomfortable. After all, Tianyuan Sect's resources were shallow and had suffered a major battle, almost losing the sect. Tianyuan Sect needed resources to develop, and couldn't afford much.
