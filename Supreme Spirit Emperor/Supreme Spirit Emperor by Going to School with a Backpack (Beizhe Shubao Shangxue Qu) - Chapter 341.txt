Just like Meng Yunxiao, Yin Fish Artifact Spirit also immediately conveyed the news to the three within the grand hall—Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian.

"What!" Upon hearing Yin Fish Artifact Spirit's words, the three's minds trembled; their eyes instantly welled up with tears as they leapt out of the hall, appearing outside the Tianyuan Continent.

As soon as they emerged, they saw Jiang Nanxuan standing there with an air of calm detachment. His eyes carried a faint smile.

"Senior!" Jiang Nanxuan bowed respectfully, his gaze meeting Luo Xiong and the two others.

"Nie, don't be formal. You know, right?" Luo Xiong nodded at Jiang Nanxuan, his eyes reflecting a touch of admiration. During the years Luo Tian was absent, it had been this young man who took his place.

"Yes, I know the news. Finally, I can rest!" Jiang Nanxuan's face carried a faint smile as he gazed at the three figures approaching.

"?" However, in the next moment, all four furrowed their brows slightly. The figures approaching weren't Luo Tian's form but two burly men and a slender girl.

"What's going on?" The four felt puzzled, observing the three who had now arrived near them. Their expressions shifted.

"These are the three people the Divine Race seeks. Why have they come to the Four Sacred Star Domains?" Though puzzled, Luo Xiong still bowed respectfully toward the transformed Luo Tian.

"Three of you—what business brings you to my Tianyuan Continent?" Luo Xiong smiled, addressing the figure he assumed was Luo Tian.

"Disobedient son! Luo Tian! You've returned!" Before Luo Xiong could finish, Luo Tian's voice echoed in their ears.

Luo Tian's eyes were filled with emotion as he tore off the thousand-illusion mask, revealing his true visage. He immediately knelt before Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian.

"You... you... you..." Seeing the familiar figure and voice, Luo Xiong's face shifted abruptly. His aged hands trembled as he helped Luo Tian up.

"Child, you... have returned!" Luo Xiong was momentarily speechless, scrutinizing Luo Tian with a look of deep concern.

Zhang Qiuyue's eyes were also teary as she clutched her son's hand, unable to utter a word.

Luo Tian gazed at the three, his heart overflowing with emotion. He could imagine their despair upon hearing of his death.

"Good, you're back," Luo Xiong wiped his eyes and gently patted Luo Tian's shoulder.

"Jiang Xiong!" Luo Tian turned to Jiang Nanxuan, who stood there with a serene expression. Compared to Zheng Xin, Gu Lei, and Xu Liyi—those unreliable companions—Luo Tian knew Jiang Nanxuan had taken his place after he left.

"I'll take my leave first. We haven't informed the others of your return yet. As for who to notify, you decide," Jiang Nanxuan sighed deeply, a faint smile on his face.

"Uncle Jiang, quickly use the Ancient Heaven Palace to subdue him! He's not my father—he's a thief named Sima Tuo in disguise!" Just as the group was overjoyed, Luoli's youthful voice echoed in their ears.

"What?" Upon hearing this, Luo Xiong and the others' expressions shifted abruptly, their gazes turning hostile toward Luo Tian.

"Who are you?" However, the four quickly located the source of the voice—a slender young woman. What struck them most was that this girl's voice was male, and it felt oddly familiar.

"I'm Li'er... Grandpa!" Luoli's eyes held confusion as she gazed at Luo Xiong and the others.

"It is indeed Li'er's voice!" Soon, Luo Xiong and the others were utterly bewildered. The figure before them was real, yet this girl's voice seemed to contradict it.

"Kid, who is this girl? Is she another one..." Zhang Qiuyue furrowed her brow, gazing at Luo Tian with a strange expression.

"Ah..." Luo Tian sighed, looking at the group with an exasperated face as he addressed Sun Kemin: "Restore this kid to his original form. It's too troublesome!"

Chapter 1381: Reunion?

"Good!" Sun Kemin observed Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian's bewildered expressions, laughing heartily. He waved his hand, revealing Luoli's delicate face before their eyes.

"This..." Luo Xiong and the others were even more bewildered, staring at Luoli with expressions of disbelief.

"This disguise technique is truly astonishing—it even deceived us!" Luo Nantian sighed softly, watching Sun Kemin's得意 expression.

"That's because you don't know who I am!" Sun Kemin smirked, restoring his own appearance and letting out a haughty hum.

"Sun Kemin!" Upon seeing Sun Kemin, Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian's expressions shifted abruptly.

"Grandpa, Grandfather! Subdue them immediately—especially this imposter who pretended to be my father!" Luoli instantly flew beside Luo Xiong and the others, shouting at them.

"Sun Kemin! You dare to appear again—dare to dig up my son's grave!" Zhang Qiuyue's face darkened, her sword humming as it materialized in her hand. Her aura radiated an intimidating presence, and she prepared to charge at Sun Kemin.

"Brave indeed!" Luo Xiong's expression was cold as he moved his hands, summoning Yin Fish Artifact Spirit.

"Subdue!" Jiang Nanxuan's face carried a faint smile, yet his expression was icy. He gestured, and the Ancient Heaven Palace hovering over Wuxing Mountain emitted a resonant hum. A radiant light descended.

"Damn it! Luo Tian, you're not betraying me, are you? I did help you!" Sun Kemin's voice trembled as he gazed at the blinding Ancient Heaven Palace, his eyes locking onto Luo Tian.

"Never mind, he did help me," Luo Tian shook his head gently, a faint smile on his face. He waved his hand, and Yin Fish Tortoise Shell and the Ancient Heaven Palace fell silent.

"You're not exactly a good person!" Luoli pouted, still convinced Luo Tian was Sima Tuo in disguise.

"Idiot child, he's your father! Who else could so effortlessly command the Ancient Heaven Palace and Yin Fish?" Zhang Qiuyue's face softened with affection as she patted Luoli's head.

"You little brat, I really am your real father. You've cursed me all this time! I'd like to beat you to death!" Luo Tian couldn't help but curse again, his eyes filled with tenderness.

"Dad? You really are my dad?" Luoli's youthful face was filled with disbelief as he stared at Luo Tian, speechless.

"Father didn't die, right? How is this possible!" Luoli's eyes widened with disbelief. His gaze at Luo Tian's eyes turned moist, the emotional contrast too great for him to process immediately.

"Your father is indeed alive. For years, we thought this boy was injured and hadn't returned, fearing his enemies would seek him out. So we kept your father's survival a secret," Luo Xiong addressed Luoli.

"Dad..." At that moment, with Luo Xiong and the others' confirmation, Luoli finally accepted it. He let out a loud cry and rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Boom..." Two bodies collided, Luoli tightly embracing Luo Tian. A familiar sensation instantly enveloped Luoli's mind—this familiarity had only existed in his childhood memories.

"Enough, you're both grown up!" Luo Tian smiled, patting Luoli's back. He let out a long sigh.

"Alas... Li'er's fate is truly tragic," Luo Xiong glanced at Luoli, letting out a long sigh. He then noticed Luo Nantian and Zhang Qiuyue's expressions returning to normal.

"Qianxue, Qiu Chan... where are they?" Luo Tian's eyes softened as he asked. Soon after, his expression turned puzzled. Normally, upon returning, he should have seen the four women immediately—but they hadn't appeared yet, casting a shadow over his heart.

"They... aren't on the Tianyuan Continent!" Luo Xiong and the others fell silent after hearing Luo Tian's words, then spoke softly.

"Not on the Tianyuan Continent?" Luo Tian furrowed his brow, his premonition growing stronger.

"Your mother and the others went looking for you!" Luo Tian's eyes reflected sorrow. Having been separated from his parents since childhood, Luoli had matured quickly. Yet over the years, he hadn't stopped sneaking out to search for Qianxue and the others.

"Let's talk later," Luo Tian said solemnly, waving his hand. The Ancient Heaven Palace emitted a radiant glow, enveloping them all and vanishing into the stars.

At the same time, friends closely connected to Luo Tian also sensed the fluctuations from within the Ancient Heaven Palace, their faces filled with confusion.

"Little brat, didn't I tell you to run if you couldn't fight!" Zheng Xin's face was filled with anger as she barked at a rugged young man.

"I'm back!" A deep voice echoed in Zheng Xin's mind, causing her body to tremble. Hearing that familiar voice, she stared in disbelief, allowing the Ancient Heaven Palace to envelop her and vanish from Zheng Tianyao's sight.

"This is wrong, the poisons clash! You can't unleash their full potency!" Gu Lei, hands behind his back, continuously instructed his son. Soon after, he heard Luo Tian's voice and trembled, vanishing from Gu Guanyu's sight.

"Finally gone!" Gu Guanyu sighed deeply, his face filled with strong reluctance as he vanished from the courtyard.

In another courtyard, Xu Liyi stood in white robes, quite flirtatious at the entrance. "Qingqing, I love you! I love you like a mouse loves rice!"

"Go away..." A deep roar echoed through the courtyard, making Xu Liyi's lips twitch. His eyes softened.

"This is the 19,818th time! Qingqing, when will you accept me?" Xu Liyi shouted loudly, then straightened his shoulders: "I won't give up!"

A radiant light enveloped Xu Liyi's mind, and Luo Tian's voice echoed within. Xu Liyi's face suddenly changed, hurriedly fleeing the courtyard and rushing into the open Ancient Heaven Palace.

"What's going on?" Luo Qingqing stepped out of the door, her face filled with confusion. She didn't know why Xu Liyi had suddenly left.

Within the first level of the Ancient Heaven Palace, figures kept appearing, their eyes filled with disbelief as they gazed at Luo Tian.

"Luo Tian..."

"Big brother!" Xu Liyi, Chen Zhanbiao, Gu Lei, Zheng Xin—each familiar face surrounded Luo Tian with shouts of disbelief.

"What's going on? You're not dead!" Xu Liyi cursed, slapping Gu Lei's face.

"Grass! What are you doing? Grass!" Gu Lei's face darkened, raising his hand to fight Xu Liyi.

"Does it hurt?" Xu Liyi asked as they struggled.

"Piss off, try it and see if it hurts!" Gu Lei roared, but soon both men's faces were filled with excitement.

"It's not a dream! Ha!" They shouted, lifting Luo Tian into their arms.

Chen Zhanbiao and Zheng Xin also surrounded Luo Tian, eyes moist, breathing heavily as they gazed at him.

"Brother!" Luo Tian let the group hit him repeatedly, his eyes glistening with emotion.

After a while of commotion, they turned hostile toward Luo Tian: "You're alive! Why did you take so long to return!"

"Alas... I had no choice," Luo Tian sighed deeply, his voice filled with helplessness. He recounted his experiences in the Origin Domain.

"By the way, have you found out about the Seven Star Island people?" He then asked about the Seven Star Island's situation, as the Void Warship hadn't been drawn into the Master of Intercepting Heaven's inheritance.

"The Seven Star Island people arrived over a decade ago and are currently hiding within the Four Sacred Star Domains. However, they're concealing themselves because the Four Sacred Star Domains have become abnormal. We always feel that a Holy Sect might be planning something against the Four Sacred Star Domains. If so, the Seven Star Island people would become a trump card." Luo Xiong spoke, his voice cold.

"Hmm," Luo Tian nodded. The Seven Star Island people were the weakest in the Origin Domain, but within the Four Sacred Star Domains, they definitely surpassed any Holy Sect.

"Can you find out which Holy Sect is planning something against the Four Sacred Star Domains?" Luo Tian's face darkened, recalling Luoli's ambush.

"It's hard to say; we haven't confirmed yet. However, the Holy Sects across the Nine Domains are limited—Yao Domain and Huo Domain are friendly, Xingluo Domain is amicable. Xiuluo Domain and Hun Domain's attitude is ambiguous. And the Divine Race of Shenmo Domain had sworn blood oaths with Sun Shengtian not to attack the Four Sacred Star Domains. That leaves only the Feng Clan, which betrayed Yao Domain."

"The Feng Clan?" Luo Tian shook his head lightly. He knew the Feng Clan was powerful, but it wouldn't stir up much trouble.

Moreover, those who ambushed Luoli were from the Yin Yang Sect, and the Yin Yang Sect's backer was the Divine Race. It was likely that the Divine Race had already started their move.

"The Nine Domains are currently relatively peaceful, so we've only restricted Luoli and others from leaving. On the Tianyuan Continent, it's still safe!" Luo Xiong shook his head gently, his expression filled with resentment. He knew that Luo Tian had sacrificed his life for the Nine Domains, yet they'd still ambushed his only son.

"I'll handle this myself. Tell me about Qianxue's whereabouts!" Luo Tian took a deep breath, asking his question.

"Alas... the four girls left for the domain beyond after you disappeared, searching for you. However, in the first few years, they still sent messages back. When the news of your return came from the Void Warship, we lost contact with them completely."

"It's not your fault," Luo Tian shook his head, not blaming Luo Xiong. He then wore a determined expression.

"I'll find them and bring our family together!" Luo Tian patted Luoli's shoulder, speaking softly.

"Any news about Gu Zǔ?" Luo Tian then asked about Gu Tianshu's status. That was also a thorn in his heart.

"There is news. Xiting returned once several years ago, taking a few sacred herbs. She said Gu Zǔ was in a critical moment. After that, there were no more messages." Luo Xiong and the others replied.

"Hmm, alright. Everyone, I'm fine. My return must remain secret for now because I have a plan!" Luo Tian smiled again, addressing Xu Liyi and the others.

"Damn it! We've been holding this grudge for a long time. How dare they insult our Four Sacred Star Domains! Let's storm the Ming Domain and exterminate those phoenixes!" Zheng Xin and others roared, their eyes cold. They'd accumulated a lot of resentment over the years.

"Yes! Damn it, my son almost died at their hands last time!" Gu Lei's voice was like thunder, shaking the ears of those nearby.

"For the peace of the Nine Domains, it's not yet time to make a big move!" Luo Tian smiled slightly, then turned his gaze toward Sun Kemin.

"They can ambush our descendants; why can't we? We just need to hide our appearances!"

"That's troublesome, Sun Xiong. Please thoroughly conceal our appearances," Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice filled with cold killing intent.

"Leave it to me. I guarantee even his father won't recognize him!" Sun Kemin patted his chest, a confident expression on his face.

Hearing this, Luoli felt awkward and looked at Luo Tian, recalling how he hadn't recognized his own father.

"Alright, I'll stay here in the Ancient Heaven Palace for now and can't go out. If you have anything, come find me here!" Luo Tian's eyes carried a faint smile. Though Qianxue and the others were missing, having these brothers around made Luo Tian feel more at ease.

Moreover, since the four girls' soul lamps hadn't gone out, they might be in another place as well. Finding them would require careful planning. Luo Tian needed to settle everything first.

"Alright, you all chat on," Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian smiled, leaving the space for these young people.

Though they were called "youngsters," these people's children had already grown up, but they still retained their old personalities.

The group kept chatting and recounting the events over the years, making Luo Tian smile lightly. He also detailed his past in the Origin Domain.

"Alas..." As they were enjoying themselves, Xu Liyi let out a long sigh, his eyes filled with sorrow.

"You all are fine—married with children. I'm the only one left!" Xu Liyi looked at their happy faces, sighing softly.

"Alas, brother, I don't say this to you, but you're too weak. You've proposed so many times in over a decade and still haven't succeeded. You need to be sincere!" Zheng Xin felt sympathy for Xu Liyi, placing his hand on Xu Liyi's shoulder and looking at Luo Tian.

"Look at Luo Tian, he has four! Let him teach you a few moves; one move would be enough!" Zheng Xin recalled the scene in Wind Valley years ago, his eyes filled with nostalgia.

"What?" Hearing Zheng Xin's words, Xu Liyi's eyes lit up and he looked at Luo Tian.

"Brother, help me!" Xu Liyi addressed Luo Tian, leaving him speechless.

"This..." Luo Tian was also somewhat troubled. After all, helping Zheng Xin had been a spontaneous idea.

"Let's try again. That move from Zheng Xin? But you'll have to endure some pain!" Luo Tian sighed softly, hoping Xu Liyi would succeed.

"What move?" Xu Liyi's eyes lit up, looking at Luo Tian and Zheng Xin. Others also gazed at the two.

Zheng Xin, with a sense of superiority, recounted how he had revived himself and made Dan Yuyan confess in Wind Valley.

"Are you telling me to fake my death?" Xu Liyi, so intelligent, immediately realized the core of the matter.

"Yes, fake death—but make it real! You can do it like this..." Zheng Xin kept speaking, making everyone a bit speechless.

"Alright, let's do it!" Xu Liyi immediately agreed and spoke to everyone: "I have a poem here. Adding it might be better!"

"Regret not this life's deep love, willing to wander alone and drift. Long regret for lovers only in dreams, rather than heaven but not you!" Xu Liyi spoke flirtatiously, his eyes filled with confidence.

"Damn it! You're so good at insulting people, and you can even write poetry!" Gu Lei and Zheng Xin shouted in disbelief.

"That's because I am who I am! Before I trained, I was a scholar!" Xu Liyi, seeing their surprised expressions, took out a fan and waved it.

"Alright, let's do this!" The group discussed further, forgetting Luo Tian's presence.

"Good, we haven't collaborated in years. Let's do it again three days from now to help Xu Liyi win Qingqing!" They shouted loudly.

"Uncles, aunts, what can I do?" Luoli crept over with a sly look but was kicked out by the group.

"Kids, don't learn from them!" Luo Tian pulled Luoli out.

"Oh..." Luoli lowered his head, constantly glancing at Zheng Xin and the others, clearly very interested.

"You'll stay with me in the Ancient Heaven Palace these few days. I'll check your cultivation!" Luo Tian spoke authoritatively, adopting a strict face.

"Yes yes!" When it came to cultivation, Luoli's face glowed with light, his expression confident.

The group chatted for a while longer before leaving the Ancient Heaven Palace, especially Xu Liyi's eyes filled with excitement, as if he were about to get married.

Three days passed quickly. Luo Tian stayed in the Ancient Heaven Palace, teaching Luoli everything he could. How much Luoli would grasp depended on him, but Luo Tian was also amazed by his son's talent. Even he had nothing to say about it.

On the third morning, Xu Liyi followed the group's plan and left the Tianyuan Continent, heading straight for Duan Shen崖. His body radiated a glow.

Soon, he arrived at Duan Shen崖 as planned, sitting cross-legged and pretending to be attacked like Zheng Xin had. He was then severely wounded.

Time passed slowly, and as Xu Liyi waited anxiously, a wave of energy finally echoed in the void. Three cold figures appeared before Xu Liyi's eyes.

"Xu Liyi, I didn't expect you to dare come out alone!" A cold voice echoed in the air. Cold energy radiated from the three figures, their true faces hidden by special means.

"You came early!" Xu Liyi's eyes carried a faint smile, smiling at the three.

"Huh?" The three were taken aback by Xu Liyi's words, not expecting him to show no tension.

"Is there a trap?" The three immediately heightened their alertness but, upon finding no one else besides Xu Liyi, felt slightly relieved. Their aura gradually rose.

"Acting so real!" Xu Liyi, seeing the three's cold aura, secretly marveled.

"You three are overdoing it. The time is still early; relax a bit. Don't be too harsh, my happiness depends on you three!" Xu Liyi's face still carried a smile as he gazed at the three cold figures, further admiring Gu Lei's acting skills.

"Even in death, you can still smile. You're truly Xu Liyi!" The three were bewildered by Xu Liyi's attitude, unsure what scheme he was up to.

"Kill!" However, the three soon realized their mission and worried about delays. They moved swiftly toward Xu Liyi.

"Time's up, Zhanbiao, go inform Qingqing!" Xu Liyi saw the three attacking him and smiled, moving toward them.

"Die!" Seeing Xu Liyi rushing toward them, the three's eyes flashed with coldness. They felt delighted and raised their swords, emitting a chilling aura. The three blades of light slashed down, creating a massive blade of light.

"Damn it! You don't need to act so real!" Xu Liyi felt the strength of their attacks and shouted, confused. The three's attacks were incredibly powerful; if he didn't fight with all his strength, he might be severely injured.

"Poof..." The three green blades of light instantly repelled Xu Liyi, leaving him in a mess.

"You're taking it too far! I'll endure this!" Xu Liyi shouted, his eyes filled with anger.

"Kill..." The three ignored him and attacked Xu Liyi again.

"Wait, when I succeed, I'll settle with you! This time, for happiness, I'll endure!" Xu Liyi shouted as the three attacked him again.

Meanwhile, on the Tianyuan Continent, Luo Tian, Gu Lei, and Zheng Xin smiled as they addressed Chen Zhanbiao: "Zhanbiao, go inform Qingqing. Tell her that Xu Liyi was ambushed at Duan Shen崖 and is in critical condition!"

Chapter 1383: Love Has No Boundaries

"Boom... boom..." The sound of explosions kept rising beneath Duan Shen崖. Xu Liyi was in a mess, his body covered with wounds of all sizes.

"Damn it! Are you really trying to kill me?" Xu Liyi roared, his hands constantly forming seals to block the three's attacks. Each attack left him in a mess and added more wounds. His aura was also weakening, but he knew they wouldn't kill him—perhaps it was just a prank.

"Truly admirable, Xu Liyi. Even in this situation, you can still smile. Your composure is admirable!" A cold voice echoed through the stars, making Xu Liyi's brow furrow slightly. He felt something was off.

"Boom..." The sound of explosions echoed from the distance, making Xu Liyi's face change.

"It's here! Don't let it slip! Pay attention to timing, don't kill me!" Xu Liyi's eyes lit up, thinking Qingqing had arrived. He quickly addressed the three.

"They're talking nonsense again!" The three exchanged glances, then felt someone approaching. They glanced at each other and suddenly raised their power to deliver a final strike before fleeing.

But the three were stunned by Xu Liyi's actions. At this moment, instead of fighting back against the three's powerful attacks, Xu Liyi stood there with a flirtatious demeanor, adjusting his hair.

"Wait, if I fall like this, will it be cool?"

"Also, you need to time it right. Make sure Qingqing catches me!" Xu Liyi kept speaking to the three.

The three were confused. Since they started ambushing Xu Liyi, he had been talking nonsense, as if not taking them seriously at all.

"Kill..." The three were finally angry. Xu Liyi clearly didn't respect them.

"Respect our profession! We're here to kill you!" The three roared, then unleashed their terrifying power.

Three martial arts techniques, with a shocking aura, shook the stars. Xu Liyi's face changed instantly.

"Damn it! I'm not playing anymore! You're trying to kill me!" Xu Liyi roared, sensing an unknown danger. He also felt something was off with the three.

...

"Explosions?" Far away, Luo Tian, Zheng Xin, and Gu Lei—disguised—flew toward Duan Shen崖. Their faces were filled with confusion.

"This kid must be playing here!" Zheng Xin's face was confused, sensing a tremendous fluctuation.

"No, someone is attacking him!" Luo Tian's face changed instantly. He felt the power of the fluctuation and moved swiftly, appearing outside Duan Shen崖 in an instant.

Zheng Xin and Gu Lei followed closely, their eyes filled with confusion as they appeared at Xu Liyi's battlefield.

At the moment Luo Tian and the others arrived, Xu Liyi was stunned.

"You... they..." Xu Liyi looked at Luo Tian and the others, then at the three dark figures attacking him. He immediately understood.

In a daze, three blades of light instantly appeared before Xu Liyi.

"Poof..." One blade nearly severed Xu Liyi in half, blood mist spewing from his body. He was severely wounded.

Before he could react, the second blade struck him again, hitting his already injured body and leaving Xu Liyi with a look of despair.

"Too far!" Xu Liyi laughed bitterly, his eyes filled with weakness. He was turned into a mist of blood by the second blade.

The third blade roared forward, showing no mercy toward Xu Liyi. The black flames on the blade glowed like a world-ending force, slicing toward the blood mist.

"Go!" The three black-cloaked warriors exchanged glances, seeing Luo Tian and the others. They ignored Xu Liyi's fate and tore through space to escape.

"Someone really attacked him!" At the moment Luo Tian appeared, he saw Xu Liyi turned into a mist of blood. His mind immediately understood.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian didn't chase the three but rushed toward the black blade that had slashed at the blood mist. This strike even made Luo Tian feel a sense of alarm. If it hit, Xu Liyi would definitely die.

With a roar, Luo Tian took one step forward. His eyes turned blood-red. If he watched Xu Liyi die before him, it would be more painful than killing Luo Tian himself.

A golden foot, shaking the heavens and earth, suddenly stepped onto the black blade. A violent fluctuation spread through the stars, scattering Xu Liyi's merging blood mist again.

"Idiot!" Luo Tian pointed his finger, sending an invisible fluctuation from it. It quickly gathered the scattered blood mist.

"Divine essence is fading!" Gu Lei and Zheng Xin's faces were covered in sweat. The sudden change was too great. Who could have imagined that someone would truly attack Xu Liyi?

At the same time, both of their hearts were filled with self-reproach. The three's final strike had been too late for Xu Liyi. No need to guess—Xu Liyi must have mistaken them for the three of them, which led to this tragic situation.

"Will I die?" Xu Liyi's illusory soul, gathering bit by bit, asked Luo Tian and the others.

"You won't die. You won't die!" Luo Tian roared, watching the blood mist losing divine essence, his eyes filled with anxiety.

"Ah... how could this be!" As Luo Tian and the others were anxiously waiting, a furious voice echoed through the stars. Chen Zhanbiao and Sun Kemin appeared in Luo Tian's group's sight.

Accompanying them was a woman, her aura filled with killing intent. She immediately flew toward Luo Tian's group.

"Qingqing!" Gu Lei and Zheng Xin's faces showed bitterness. They hadn't expected Qingqing to arrive at this moment.

"Qingqing..." Xu Liyi's illusory soul smiled, gazing at Qingqing who flew toward them.

"You bastard! How could you be so pitiful? You always boasted how strong you were!" Qingqing glared at Xu Liyi's pitiful form, almost vanishing.

"Qingqing, I think I really am dying. Can I recite a poem for you before I die?" Xu Liyi spoke softly.

"Before dying, let me declare my love one last time—this is the 19,999th time!" Xu Liyi smiled.

"Qingqing, remember: if anyone proposes to you in the future, they must surpass my number before you accept!" Xu Liyi continued.

"Don't talk nonsense! You won't die!"

"Luo Tian, if you can't save him, we're done! I know you have a way!" Qingqing shouted at Luo Tian, her voice filled with excitement.

"It's a bit difficult," Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice carrying an indescribable sadness. Qingqing's heart dropped instantly.

"Regret not this life's deep love, willing to wander alone and drift. Long regret for lovers only in dreams, rather than heaven but not you!" Xu Liyi's illusory soul gazed at Qingqing, his eyes filled with obsession.

"Right now, what are you reciting poetry for? Wait until you're alive to recite it for me!" Qingqing roared.

"Luo Tian, I should be able to reincarnate, right?" Xu Liyi laughed bitterly, feeling his state was terrible.

"Rest assured. If you reincarnate, I'll find you. You Xu Liyi are my man in life and my ghost in death!" Qingqing spoke again, her voice filled with dominance.

"Converge..." Luo Tian waved his hand, a powerful soul appeared before him—this was one of the two immortal-level souls he had stored in the Yin Yang Sect.

"By my name, seal it!" Luo Tian pulled his hand, tearing apart the immortal-level soul. He then refined it into a surge of divine essence and directed it toward Xu Liyi.

"Buzz..." The hum echoed, and Xu Liyi's illusory soul stabilized instantly with the addition of this epoch-level soul.

"Blood Rebirth!" Seeing Xu Liyi's soul stabilize, Luo Tian sighed deeply and then spat a drop of his heart blood. It merged into the soul mist, which was almost dead.
