Chapter 2688: Departure

"Hello everyone, it's been a while!" Luo Tian smiled as he gazed at the gathering atop the highest mountain peak. Some of them were familiar to him—prodigies from the same era when he first entered the Xian World, now formidable powerhouses.

"Luotian, how dare you!" Those who had been guided through the First Heaven were enraged, their eyes burning with fury.

"Everyone, don't act rashly. We have no grudge; I don't wish to kill!" Luo Tian replied, his smile unwavering as he observed the crowd.

"Six late-stage Immortal Kings?" Luo Tian mused, his gaze sweeping over the six elders atop the summit.

These men were unknown to him; during his time in the Xian World, he hadn't been worthy of their company. Yet he surmised they were among the sect's hidden strengths, rarely seen.

"Kill him! Avenge the millions of disciples who perished in our world!"
"I'll avenge myself by killing this traitor to the Xian World!" Roars of fury echoed, laced with hatred.

It was due to the Hell's invasion that they had been displaced, their families and friends slain in war.

At this moment, the crowd had vanished from the First Heaven's location; the surrounding area still shimmered with nine-colored divine light, but beyond it lay endless darkness.

"Seems I killed them too!"
"If you hadn't forced us, why would we betray the Xian World? We couldn’t just wait to die. Speak nonsense—come and take my life if you dare!" Luo Tian's eyes held disdain as he flicked his finger, sending a gust of wind from his fingertip.

*Plop!*
Blood splattered as the man who had cursed Luo Tian was pierced through, collapsing to the ground.

"You..." Seeing Luo Tian's audacity in killing here, all were enraged.

"Attack together! Kill him!" The crowd roared, unleashing martial techniques toward Luo Tian.

"Stop! Do you want to go to the Upper Three Heavens? Remember the current situation!" A voice bellowed as waves of energy rose. Bai Tian and other sect leaders shouted in unison.

At this moment, they were being transported; if anything happened, none would escape the nine-colored divine light.

"Luo Tian, state your purpose!" Bai Tian sighed, regretful if they were on opposing sides.

Currently, the First Heaven was under Bai Tian's control; the six late-stage Immortal Kings hailed from other sects, one of whom was an elder of the Bai Clan. However, these elders had long withdrawn from worldly affairs, making Bai Tian the de facto leader.

Yet over the years, Bai Tian had not disappointed them, managing the First Heaven with precision.

"Nothing much—just a visit to the Upper Three Heavens. It's on my way!" Luo Tian replied, locking eyes with Bai Tian.

"Bravo for your audacity; you're striding further into self-destruction!" A middle-aged man in green robes replied, his tone laced with mockery despite a hint of admiration.

"Seems familiar... we’ve met before..." Luo Tian studied the man, recognizing a vague familiarity but not his identity.

"Ah..." The middle-aged man's face turned awkward upon realizing Luo Tian didn’t recognize him.

Back then, during the Mid-Three Heavens' upheaval, the entire region had been shattered by the Tianyuan Sect. Rankings shifted, many sects ascended, and this man's sect was among them.

His name was Zhang Tianyi, leader of the Qinghong Sect. In his youth, he had served in Buxian City, thus knowing Luo Tian.

Zhang Tianyi had intended to gloat but was met with ignorance, leaving him embarrassed.

"You have no right to stand beside me; get lost!" Luo Tian sneered, understanding the man's intent—boosting his own reputation.

A pressure wave surged; Zhang Tianyi’s body trembled, feeling a mountain's weight on his back before landing atop the peak.

"Arrogant..."
"But he has the right to be arrogant!" The crowd murmured; Luo Tian was no longer the man they once knew.

"I’ve done so much to provoke fate, yet I still live!" Luo Tian laughed coldly, finding a seat.

"Everyone, it's been a while—won’t you sit and share a drink?" Luo Tian addressed Bai Tian and other former sect disciples.

"Your courage is remarkable; if I were you, I’d leave now!" Bai Tian pulled a chair, accepting Luo Tian’s cup and clinking it in a drink. The others Luo Tian had invited did not move, fearing association with him and potential complications upon entering the Upper Three Heavens.

"Now he’s calm, but the six late-stage Immortal Kings are at the transport exit—how will he handle it?" All pondered.

"Nothing to do but proceed; I must enter the Upper Three Heavens!" Luo Tian and Bai Tian chatted.

"The late-stage Immortal Kings are at the exit; you won’t get through!" Bai Tian mused, sitting with Luo Tian. Upon hearing this, Luo Tian was startled but masked it, understanding these Mid-Three Heavens forces wouldn’t attack now due to fear of transport mishaps. If space were stable, they’d surely strike.

Yet these Mid-Three Heavens forces weren’t a threat to Luo Tian; the late-stage Immortal Kings were. He wasn’t their match yet.

"One hour left—don’t blame me!" Bai Tian sighed, downing his cup.

"Right, no mercy!" Luo Tian nodded, and the two fell silent, clinking cups repeatedly.

Time passed slowly; an hour approached, people stirred with anticipation, sensing thick Xian energy.

"Almost entering the Upper Three Heavens!" They shouted as a white exit emerged in their view.

"Once there, I’ll make this kid regret it!" They gazed at Luo Tian standing up.

"Goodbye, Bai Tian—should we meet again, I’ll spare your life!" Luo Tian bowed to Bai Tian. Among the Mid-Three Heavens, only Bai Tian earned Luo Tian’s respect. Luo Tian decided not to exit; it was too dangerous, a near-dead end.

Chapter 2689: Meeting Eternity

The Upper Three Heavens, Duti Mountain.

Duti Mountain was renowned in the Upper Three Heavens, a central hub not belonging to any of the Nine Immortal Mountains.

At this moment, a vast Dao platform stood there, surrounded by a nine-colored divine light spanning nearly a hundred miles. Several figures stood there, their aura formidable.

These were the Upper Three Heavens’ late-stage Immortal Kings—masters of the entire Xian World. Their expressions were grim.

To construct this platform, they had invested immense effort and resources, aiming to transport the Mid-Three Heavens’ people into the Upper Three.

"It should be soon!" An elder spoke, gazing at the nine-colored light piercing the sky.

*Boom...*
As the elder’s words faded, thunderous roars erupted above them. The nine-colored light dimmed.

The sky trembled; mountains fell from the heavens, and figures appeared in the elders’ sight.

Seeing these mountains, the late-stage Immortal Kings narrowed their eyes. Each raised hands, unleashing divine laws; serpentine script dragons emerged from their palms, coiling around the descending mountains.

At the same time, the nine-colored light vanished completely, and the roaring mountains landed平稳 around Duti Mountain.

"Respect Eternity Immortal King, Buxian Immortal King, and Duanhun Immortal King..." A chorus of respectful voices echoed, a sea of voices bowing.

"Good, you’ve all worked hard!" Buxian Immortal King smiled warmly.

"Report, Luo Tian just escaped the transport light and vanished through space!" Voices rushed to the late-stage Immortal Kings.

"Luo Tian?" Upon hearing this, their eyes snapped open, gazing at the healed sky.

"What does he want in the Upper Three Heavens?" The Immortal Kings exchanged glances, finally focusing on Buxian Immortal King, as they were closest to him. They assumed Luo Tian had come for Buxian.

"Secure him first; I’ll check!" Eternity Immortal King’s eyes flashed cold, grabbing space and plunging into the rift.

"Yongsheng!" Buxian Immortal King sneered, chasing after Eternity.

But before Buxian could move, several figures blocked his path.

"We should secure these people first; Buxian, let Yongsheng handle him alone!" Donghuang spoke, a smile on his face.

Opportunity was fleeting; the sky had healed. Even if Buxian wished to tear space, finding Yongsheng was difficult. Space’s greatest danger was instability, ever-moving.

"Fine, how to secure them?" Buxian’s eyes were icy as he addressed the others.

"I think placing them in my Donghuang Sect would be best!" Donghuang spoke, gazing at the Mid-Three Heavens’ people. They were a powerful force, especially after war’s trials—elite warriors.

"Leave it; Donghuang Sect is strong enough. I think placing them in my Yiaowang Sect would be better!"
"My Guiwang Sect also needs people!" Other late-stage Immortal Kings spoke, vying for the group.

The late-stage Immortal Kings eyed each other; though no further arguments arose, none showed retreat.

"I have an idea—either disperse them among the sects or let them form their own faction!" Donghuang proposed.

"Form a faction?" The late-stage Immortal Kings were puzzled, gazing at Donghuang.

"Indeed; Duyu Mountain hasn’t been inhabited for a long time. We could place them there, establishing another Immortal Mountain!"

"Of course, it depends on their worth. Duyu Mountain is a prime location; if none reach Immortal King peak within a millennium, they’ll prove unworthy of another mountain!" Donghuang spoke.

"Excellent idea!" The other late-stage Immortal Kings were pleased; the Mid-Three Heavens’ people also showed shock.

A chance to ascend—unimaginable, they’d become an Immortal Mountain.

Buxian’s eyes flashed anger briefly but knew protesting was futile. He soared into the sky toward Buxian Sect.

"Go to Duyu Mountain; remember our words!" Donghuang addressed Bai Tian and others, vanishing from sight.

"They’re another Immortal Mountain!" As the late-stage Immortal Kings left, cheers erupted; only Bai Tian and six late-stage Immortal Kings, along with key figures, frowned.

"Let’s go check Duyu Mountain; it hasn’t been open for ages!" Bai Tian sighed, recalling Duyu’s past glory.

The group began organizing, marching toward Duyu Mountain.

...

In the gray void, Luo Tian’s eyes were cautious as he stepped forward, gazing at endless void.

"Never take the wrong path; if I enter Hell, it’ll be tragic!" Luo Tian muttered, needing to find the position of Bujiu Mountain to tear space and escape. But this was too hard for anyone.

Luo Tian had chosen to leave when the Mid-Three Heavens’ people entered Xian World, avoiding those late-stage Immortal Kings.

Yet this was a gamble; the void wouldn’t kill him, but could lose him, tearing space to unknown places.

"Kid, you really have guts coming back to Xian World!" A cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, making him recoil.

*Boom...*
The void trembled; a green door slammed onto the spot where Luo Tian had stood.

"Yongsheng, you old bastard!" Luo Tian shouted upon seeing the attacker.

Luo Tian hadn’t expected Yongsheng to find him, his heart tense.

"Bravo for your courage; you’re truly the one with the Epoch Book!" Yongsheng smiled, already deciding to eliminate Luo Tian this time. He felt no chance if he failed.

*Zhu...*
Yongsheng’s hand held a翠绿色 (emerald green) long sword, advancing toward Luo Tian.

"Only you? I’ll see how much I differ from true late-stage masters!" Luo Tian’s eyes turned cold, his crackling spear materializing without fear.

Chapter 2690: Falling into the Death Desert

In the void, two figures stood a hundred zhang apart, locking eyes. The void trembled as energy clashed.

Yongsheng held an emerald green sword, radiating divine light; its aura surrounded the blade. He smiled at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian wielded his crackling spear, his face tense as he felt Yongsheng’s overwhelming aura.

Luo Tian had met Yongsheng before, but when he was weak, he knew Yongsheng’s strength—easily able to crush him.

Now a late-stage Immortal King, Luo Tian still felt Yongsheng’s might, the pressure making him tense.

Late-stage Immortal Kings differed from two late-stage Huangquan soldiers; it was a pressure, the peak of Xian King, subduing all.

*Roar...*
Luo Tian activated his domain, a cacophony of souls howling from him, spreading toward Yongsheng.

"I sense danger in you; now you’re worthy of my attention!" Yongsheng spoke softly, his aura rippling. Green domain spread from him, yet the void remained calm within it, filled with intense vitality.

Two domains—green and gray—seemed slow but collided instantly, *crack* sounds echoing. Each sound caused Luo Tian’s mind to roar.

Yet Luo Tian’s domain was formidable, holding back Yongsheng’s.

"Now you have two choices,"
"Either hand over the book, and I’ll take you as my disciple to enter immortality; or die!" Yongsheng spoke, seemingly unaffected by the collision.

Sweat soaked Luo Tian’s back; he didn’t answer, fearing his aura and domain would collapse if he spoke.

"So strong! I’m差距 (difference) so much from a late-stage Immortal King!" Luo Tian mused, unsure of Yongsheng’s intent.

Perhaps to distract him; if he spoke, his domain would shatter, and Yongsheng’s would strike.

Time passed; Yongsheng didn’t attack, nor did Luo Tian. They stood in the void, domains clashing with thunderous roars.

*Boom boom boom...*
After an hour, Luo Tian’s endurance allowed their domains to shatter into divine fragments, scattering into the void.

*Zhu...*
Almost instantly, both Yongsheng and Luo Tian moved; the sword hummed, a sky-piercing blade aimed at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian also thrust his spear toward Yongsheng, unleashing *Pohu* (Breaking Void).

In a flash, they vanished to each other’s sides; spear and sword met, bending.

*Boom...*
Luo Tian felt a massive force on his body, sending him flying backward.

"You’re still not strong enough!" Yongsheng stood on the void, his form vanishing and reappearing before Luo Tian, sword thrusting toward his throat.

Luo Tian swung his spear horizontally, his eyes fierce; the other hand grabbed Yongsheng’s sword.

"Ah?" Yongsheng raised his eyebrows, grabbing Luo Tian’s crackling spear.

*Peng...*
A闷 sound echoed; Yongsheng gripped the spear’s shaft, and Luo Tian grabbed his sword. The blade was within two inches of Luo Tian’s forehead.

Cold sword energy cut Luo Tian’s palm, blood dripping. They remained frozen.

"Such ability?" Yongsheng spoke, but before he finished, a storm rose from Luo Tian’s back.

A black and white pair of wings emerged, their flapping creating a storm toward Yongsheng.

Yongsheng remained calm; his sword emitted hums, its aura bursting.

At the critical moment, Luo Tian finally yielded, patting the spear’s tail, releasing his grip on Yongsheng’s sword.

Luo Tian vanished instantly; the spear flew from Yongsheng’s grasp. Yongsheng’s sword aura collided with the thunderstorm, annihilating it.

Luo Tian reappeared, forehead marked by a blood imprint; the spear returned to his hand.

"变态 (monster), late-stage Immortal Kings are truly strong—especially this one; even if he’s a late-stage, I might not beat him!" Luo Tian sighed internally. Their brief clash seemed safe but was full of danger; he was completely suppressed, *Pohu* couldn’t harm Yongsheng. If he mishandled it, his life would be lost.

"Again!" Luo Tian refused to believe; he stepped forward toward Yongsheng, knowing only close combat gave him a chance. If they clashed martial arts, he had no hope.

He initiated *Pohu* again; his wings flapped, boosting his speed to near-instantaneous arrival before Yongsheng.

A flash of cold light pierced Yongsheng, who stirred his robe, eyes finally changing; the sword expanded, blocking his path.

*Crack...*
Instantly, the spear bent again; terrifying power finally made Yongsheng retreat.

"Six Dao轮回 (Cycles)!" As Yongsheng steadied, Luo Tian appeared like a ghost; this time it was fists.

Six swirling vortexes of轮回 (Cycles) energy clashed toward Yongsheng.

"Unlimited!" Yongsheng also roared, throwing a punch; though only one, it was like a tidal wave, colliding with Luo Tian’s six.

*Crack...*
Thunder echoed before them; the void trembled, even being pierced, revealing a small patch of stars.

"Spit...!" Both Luo Tian and Yongsheng flew back; Luo Tian spat blood, colliding with the void to appear beneath the sky.

Hot air filled Luo Tian’s perception, making him startled; he gazed around, eyes full of gold.

"Death Desert!" Luo Tian exclaimed, surprised to be thrown into the Death Desert.

Chapter 2691: Huangquan Soldiers Appear

"Truly annoying..." Luo Tian cursed, gazing at the void; he had just appeared when it tore open, Yongsheng emerging from the void with his sword.

"You can’t escape!" Yongsheng slashed, a blade cutting through the sky toward Luo Tian.

"I want to leave; you can’t stop me!" Luo Tian coldly replied, sweeping his spear against the blade. It pushed him back, sending him crashing to the ground.

Dust swirled; Luo Tian stood up, eyes filled with helplessness—he still lagged behind Yongsheng.

"This time, you’re not so lucky; no matter where you hide, I’ll kill you. You can’t grow anymore!" Yongsheng spoke, hands moving; the sky roared again.

Yongsheng’s Gate!

A翠绿色 (emerald green) door descended with overwhelming divine power, making Luo Tian’s face pale.

Luo Tian roared, a black vortex rising from the blue sky, howling; black ghost claws attacked the green door.

*Boom...*
Though the hellish ghost claws were strong, they fell short of Yongsheng’s personal *Yongsheng’s Gate*, which shattered them. The door still pressed toward Luo Tian.

"Dao of the World!" Luo Tian activated his Dao of the World, body exploding in size. He unleashed six *Dao轮回* punches against the weakened *Yongsheng’s Gate*.

Another thunderous roar echoed; the sky trembled, winds reversed, and sandstorms swept outward.

The storm intensified, engulfing Luo Tian and Yongsheng; they clashed again, the storm growing larger.

Darkness and light—Luo Tian’s massive body fought against Yongsheng, neither caring where they were in the Death Desert.

To others, it was a forbidden place, but now both were peak Xian World powers; unless extremely dangerous, they couldn’t harm them.

*Peng peng peng...*
Luo Tian unleashed all his strength, clashing with Yongsheng, but results were minimal; he was covered in blood, bearing deep sword wounds.

Yongsheng was also battered but unaffected.

"It’s time to go!"
"I wish I could unleash the Tianmo Dissolution!" Luo Tian mused, gazing at Yongsheng charging again.

After an hour of battle, Luo Tian knew his gap with Yongsheng and didn’t want to fight further.

"You’ve got some moves; it’s over!" Yongsheng’s face was cold, hands rapidly forming seals. Instantly, a overwhelming aura emerged from his hands; a green figure appeared, eyes cold, one hand slamming toward Luo Tian.

The green hand overshadowed the sky, even halting the storm around them; pressure struck Luo Tian’s body.

"灭天掌 (Annihilation Hand)!" Yongsheng’s cold voice echoed; the green hand blocked the sun, making Luo Tian’s heart race.

"I said I want to leave; you can’t stop me!" Luo Tian roared, truly wanting to use *Tianmo Dissolution* against Yongsheng. He had time for it.

But he couldn’t afford the time; *Tianmo Dissolution* would weaken him, and Tianyuan Sect awaited his return.

"Sinful Mirror!" Luo Tian flipped his hand, summoning the Sinful Mirror; five annihilating lights erupted from it, rushing toward the green hand.

"Hmm?" At the light’s emergence, Yongsheng furrowed his brows, watching the five world-destroying lights. He instinctively raised a defense.

Instantly, the five lights collided with the green hand; an earth-shattering explosion echoed, sandstorms rising from their clash.

Both Luo Tian and Yongsheng flew back, engulfed in the storm; even with peak Xian King strength, no one could see their situation through the storm.

"Spit..." Luo Tian didn’t know how far he flew, only feeling golden sand around him. Blood spewed from his mouth, but also a mouthful of sand entered it.

On the other side, Yongsheng was slightly better; his body was buried in sand, leaving only his head.

*Flap flap...*
Sand scattered; Yongsheng stood up, hands moving again, gazing at where Luo Tian was buried.

"Never felt so embarrassed before!" Yongsheng sighed, green figure reappearing behind him; the green hand rapidly formed.

*Peng...*
At the same time, Luo Tian burst from the sand, bloodied, spitting out sand. He had just emerged ten zhang when his body was pressed down by immense pressure.

This time, however, Luo Tian’s hand no longer held the Sinful Mirror but a yellow ruler—the Huangquan Ruler.

"Not fighting back?" Yongsheng gazed at Luo Tian standing still, surprised.

"See what tricks you have; how many more hands can you endure?" Yongsheng sneered, slamming his hand toward Luo Tian.

"Ground!" But as he pressed, he noticed the ground beneath him had become moist.

He leapt up; instantly, their feet turned muddy, yellow springs emerging, rising rapidly.

Huangquan凝聚 (congealed), two towering figures appeared, rushing toward the green hand.

"Late-stage Immortal King!" Yongsheng finally gasped, eyes wide with disbelief at the two late-stage Huangquan soldiers.

As Yongsheng was stunned, two sword glows struck the green hand; another astonishing collision.

Yet their yellow springs surged upward, rapidly gathering around Luo Tian, enveloping him.

*Boom boom...*
After two explosions, Huangquan receded; Luo Tian emerged unscathed, no hesitation, flying toward the distance.

"Damn kid, you can’t escape; that must be Huangquan’s Huangquan Ruler!" Yongsheng watched Luo Tian leave, not chasing but rushing toward the two Huangquan soldiers.

Chapter 2692: Mount Sumeru

In an endless desert, a figure flew swiftly; two wings—one black, one white—on his back, and the words "Gui Gu" (Ghost Valley) on his back were striking.

Luo Tian gazed around, having visited the Death Desert multiple times; he was familiar with it. Yet now, his eyes were blind, confirming he hadn’t been here before.

"Return!" Luo Tian waved his Huangquan Ruler, waves of energy emanating from it.

As he activated the ruler, the Huangquan soldiers blocking Yongsheng a dozen li away exploded, turning into rolling Huangquan springs that sank into the sand, as if they’d never existed.

"Kid, I said you couldn’t escape!" Yongsheng exhaled, smiling as he stepped through space toward Luo Tian.

The yellow springs returned to the Huangquan Ruler; Luo Tian stored it, continuing to seek an exit from the Death Desert.

"Hmm?" But as he flew, he paused; he sensed an immense aura approaching him.

"Yongsheng Immortal King!" Luo Tian was surprised; his wings flapped, using Huangquan Steps to vanish.

"Damn it, how did he find me!" Luo Tian was startled; he had flown for a hundred breaths, far beyond his senses. Yongsheng shouldn’t have found him so quickly.

Luo Tian had barely left a few breaths when Yongsheng appeared at his location, smiling as he chased. Yet Luo Tian was flying desperately; Yongsheng couldn’t catch him quickly.

Luo Tian was now panicked; if Huangquan soldiers could block Yongsheng, it would help. But Huangquan soldiers had a distance limit; once exceeded, he couldn’t recall them.

"Did he leave an imprint on me?" Luo Tian pondered, checking his body for any mark but found none.

"How did he do it? Something must be wrong!" Luo Tian thought, flying desperately while figuring out how to escape Yongsheng.

He couldn’t fight; he had to flee. Fortunately, he was a late-stage Immortal King, matching in endurance.

They chased each other across the Death Desert’s sky; no one was visible, and after flying for a while, the sky darkened, turning cold.

"Old bastard, don’t push me; you won’t be happy either!" Luo Tian cursed. He had been flying aimlessly but hadn’t escaped the Death Desert.

"Wrong, this isn’t the Death Desert; it’s in the Mid-Three Heavens!" Luo Tian suddenly realized. The conditions were similar but definitely not the Death Desert, as he knew if in the Mid-Three Heavens, late-stage Immortal Kings would be suppressed!

"Where is this then?" Luo Tian panicked; he confirmed it wasn’t the Death Desert, as even if it were vast, his speed would let him escape.

"Kid, as long as you’re in the Upper Three Heavens, you’ll never escape my grasp!" Yongsheng replied, relentlessly chasing.

During the chase, the sky turned dark; starlight reflected on sand, cold air striking Luo Tian’s body, making him shiver.

"Night is colder than the Death Desert!" Luo Tian quickly noticed, confirming this wasn’t the Death Desert.

"What the hell is this place!" Luo Tian cursed internally; after chasing for hours, his spirit was exhausted. Flying with the Magic Cloud Wings and Huangquan Steps drained him greatly.

"Light..." Suddenly, Luo Tian saw waves of divine light in his vision, unusually bright. If it were daytime, he might not have seen it.

"Never mind!" Luo Tian didn’t hesitate, flying toward the light’s source, hoping it could free him from Yongsheng.

"Sihai (West Desert), Mount Sumeru!" Yongsheng followed closely, also seeing the distant divine light, his smile deepening.

The glows seemed near but took Luo Tian an hour of desperate flight to reach tens of thousands of zhang away.

"Amazement!" The first feeling was amazement; hundreds of Buddhas appeared in his vision, their light emanating from the tops of these statues.

"Buddha Light!" Luo Tian gasped, a bad premonition rising, his suspicions confirmed.

One hundred and eight Buddhas were lifelike, their postures and expressions varied; each statue radiated immense energy.

"Relic (Sarira)!" Luo Tian was shocked, seeing relics atop each Buddha’s head. He turned to flee but realized he had arrived at Mount Sumeru.

"Kid, where are you running now?" But as he turned, Yongsheng arrived instantly, his sword bursting into a sky-piercing blade toward Luo Tian.

"Old fool!" Luo Tian cursed, sweeping his spear to block the blade but was pushed back, nearing the one hundred and eight Buddhas.

"Who!" As he flew back, shouts echoed; several figures soared toward Luo Tian’s direction.

Head-shaven monks arrived at a thousand zhang away, gazing at Luo Tian who had steadied.
