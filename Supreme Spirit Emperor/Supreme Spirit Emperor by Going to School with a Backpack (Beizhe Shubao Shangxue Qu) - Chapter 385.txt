“Unexpectedly, you still dare to come to the Mortal Domain. Do you think our ancient clans are too afraid to deal with you?” Hun Badan’s face was cold. Back then, during their great battle, Luotian had nearly killed him. For years, this grudge had lingered in Hun Badan’s heart.

“Why bother talking so much? Kill him!” Yu Fanta said the same. His body radiated holy light, and a towering aura surged around him. At the same time, Yu Fanta extended his hand, and a white palm, brimming with overwhelming might, descended upon Luotian.

“Both have reached the Epoch Apex!” Luotian thought gravely, marveling at how swiftly the ancient clan heirs had advanced in cultivation.

He had risked his life, traversing the Mortal Domain to find a revelation and reach the Epoch Apex. Yet these ancient clan heirs merely trained within their own clans, yet still surged in power. Though each clan would surely pour resources into nurturing them, Luotian didn’t believe any clan could force a late Epoch stage cultivator to leap directly into the Epoch Apex.

If Luotian were at full strength, even one of them would demand caution. Now wounded and surrounded by three, his chances of escape were slim—unless he was willing to throw away his life.

Yet Luotian still had a secret weapon: Sun Mengru. As long as they didn’t unleash the Royal Weapons, there was still a chance to flee.

“Boom!” Sun Mengru’s face bore cold determination. Her hands flashed with radiant light, and a green palm, like a star, surged forward to clash against Yu Fanta’s.

The collision sent shockwaves through the air. A violent gust battered Luotian and his companions. Fu Xingxuan’s cold voice echoed: “Three of you, what is your intent? Do you wish to ignite a war between the clans?”

“Isn’t this the commander of Star Moon Guard?” Jin Zitao and Jin Ziming exchanged puzzled glances, staring at Luotian standing beside Fu Xingxuan. They wondered why these three ancient clan heirs had come to ambush Luotian.

They had guarded this entrance for years. Though the ancient clans and humans had an agreement that the clans would not enter Nine Realms, it was merely a verbal pact. Over the years, a few prodigies had slipped through.

“War between clans? Star Moon Divine Clan is truly arrogant,” Fu Xingxuan said. “You claim to be the ones who entered the Mortal Domain with my clan’s prodigy, Fan Jingyu. Now that you’ve emerged, where is he?”

“Indeed, don’t hide it. Do you think we’re all fools?” Hun Badan’s body radiated terrifying energy, his gaze locking onto Luotian with icy intent.

“An human dares to provoke us ancient clans. Though there was an agreement, it was your side that broke it first. Killing you here, the three great elders of your race will have no words,” Jin Xixi said with a smile, his eyes scanning Luotian.

“Luotian, are you still hiding your identity?” Hun Badan’s voice thundered. The sound echoed through the stars, shaking Jin Zitao and Jin Ziming.

“Luotian! He’s back in the ancient clans!” Their minds reeled. They hadn’t expected Luotian to dare return, and they were even more frustrated that they had nearly let him escape into the human realm.

“Alas, it was inevitable,” Luotian sighed deeply. He knew if nothing went wrong, he would eventually draw suspicion. After all, none of the ancient clans were simple.

“Die!” Jin Ziming and Jin Zitao snarled, their bodies flashing as they rushed toward Luotian.

“Back!” Fu Xingxuan’s cold gaze met them. Her aura surged as she stepped in front of Luotian, her hands forming a seal. A crescent moon erupted from her palm, pressing toward the two.

Jin Ziming and Jin Zitao were at late Epoch stage. Fu Xingxuan, however, was at the Epoch Apex—though only a small step apart, their power差距 was immeasurable. Even Luotian at late Epoch stage couldn’t match an Epoch Apex cultivator, let alone these two.

The white crescent moon radiated overwhelming pressure. The two men froze mid-motion, their faces dark as Fu Xingxuan’s attack loomed.

“Return to your place!” But before the moon could descend, a domineering voice echoed through the stars. A gray finger pressed down upon the moon—Hun Badan’s Supreme Finger.

“Crack!” Under Hun Badan’s Supreme Finger, the moon shattered into fragments of divine light, scattering outward.

“Fu Xingxuan, don’t be stubborn. You can’t protect him. He must stay here today!” Jin Xixi smiled, his hands moving as golden flames erupted, surrounding them.

“I will protect him!” Fu Xingxuan’s face was cold. Her golden sword materialized in her hand, her gaze resolute.

“Then you’re mistaken!” Yu Fanta’s hands formed seals. Golden feathers coalesced into sharp blades, forming a storm that devoured vast voids and surged toward Luotian.

“Want to kill me? Then at least four of you will die with me!” Luotian’s face was icy. He waved his hand, and four figures—Tu Feiyang, Fan Jingyu, Jin Ziyang, and Man Hun—materialized before him. Gray seals coiled around their bodies.

“Luotian!” The four men’s faces turned furious. They had witnessed Luotian and his companions gain the benefits of the Mortal Domain, reaching the Epoch Apex. Yet they had been sealed, watching helplessly as their cultivation stagnated at late Epoch for over two decades. This had cost them the chance to rival Luotian, leaving them resentful.

“Hum!” But soon their bodies trembled as Yu Fanta’s storm approached.

“Stop!” Seeing the four men appear, Yu Fanta and the others’ eyes flickered. They quickly extended their hands, halting the storm.

“Let me go, and I’ll release them!” Luotian and Fu Xingxuan stood between the four men, addressing Hun Badan.

“Threatening us?” Jin Xixi and the others’ faces darkened. They saw the four men hovering like commoners around Luotian—killing Luotian would mean their deaths.

Though they were powerful, they weren’t certain they could save the four men unscathed from Luotian and Fu Xingxuan.

The situation stalemated. Luotian smiled, grabbing Fan Jingyu and pulling him forward.

“Give me three breaths to decide. If you don’t answer within three, I’ll start killing them!” Luotian refused to let them think. Time was critical.

“You…” Seeing Luotian dare to threaten them, their faces darkened further. They wanted to devour him alive.

“Luotian, you dare not kill them! The curse of the Curse-Devouring Pill will also rebound!” Fan Jingyu struggled in Luotian’s grip, his eyes wild.

“Indeed, he dares not kill them. There is the curse!” Jin Xixi and the others’ eyes brightened, their gazes mocking.

“I dare not kill them. But someone else does!” Luotian sneered, golden light radiating from him. Sun Mengru appeared before him, her gaze cold—there was no need to hide now.

“Another human!” Seeing Sun Mengru, Yu Fanta, Jin Xixi, and Hun Badan’s faces stiffened. They felt a strong threat from her.

“Ten Thousand Realms Unbound, Spatial Shift!” As the situation stalemated, a cold voice echoed through the stars. Waves of energy rippled around Luotian.

The invisible waves twisted space around him. At the same time, Tu Feiyang and the others’ bodies distorted, becoming hazy before vanishing from sight.

“What’s happening?” Luotian’s face darkened, staring at the empty space. Why had this occurred?

“Spatial Shift! It’s the Blood Clan!” Fu Xingxuan’s face suddenly changed, shouting at Luotian.

“Hum…” A blood-colored figure formed a vortex, materializing before Luotian. Its face bore a seductive smile, icy fangs gleaming with red light. It lunged at Luotian.

“Damn!” As Fu Xingxuan spoke, Luotian felt a strong sense of danger. His two Reincarnation Immortal Bodies erupted from his body, white light surging in his fists as he struck the twisted space.

“Crack!” The next moment, a thunderous sound echoed. Luotian’s body was thrown back and caught by Sun Mengru and Fu Xingxuan.

“An impressive physique. Unfortunately…” A light laugh echoed as a blood-robed figure appeared before them.

“Is this my clan’s ancient heir, Xue Shengfei?” Tu Feiyang stood beneath the stars. Though sealed, his face showed joy. He recognized this ancient heir of his clan.

Seeing Xue Shengfei, Tu Feiyang’s heart relaxed. He had feared Jin Xixi and the others would ignore the four men’s lives to kill Luotian. After all, during that great battle, they had nearly died at Luotian’s hands. That day, Yu Fanta’s soul was destroyed by Zhong Zixuan’s sword. Tu Feiyang knew the price the Yu Clan had paid to revive Yu Fanta.

Now, Xue Shengfei’s arrival saved them. Tu Feiyang and the others sighed in relief.

“Luotian, you’re doomed this time!” Tu Feiyang’s face was cold. Without Luotian’s restraint, he felt the seals loosening. Powerful cultivation energy stirred. He didn’t hesitate and began to break through Luotian’s seals.

Man Hun and Jin Ziyang also smiled, breaking through the seals. They believed that with four ancient heirs ambushing Luotian, even with Fu Xingxuan and Sun Mengru’s help, Luotian would surely die.

“You’re the one everyone talks about—Luotian? Not impressive at all,” Xue Shengfei stood beneath the stars, his body surrounded by blood energy. His gaze on Luotian felt weak.

“Is this the heir of the Blood Lord?” Luotian, pale-faced, stared at Xue Shengfei. He recalled the Blood Lord from the Endless Sea of Blood, and Xue Shengfei bore an uncanny resemblance.

“Troubling,” Luotian thought. He was now in absolute danger and knew he had to fight for his life—there was no chance of survival otherwise.

“I can’t die!” Luotian looked at Sun Mengru, his eyes wild. If he died, she would surely fight back and die too. Their greatest hope was the Epoch Relic, Qiankun Zhenn魂 Tower.

“Kill!” As Luotian mused, Yu Fanta and Hun Badan rushed toward him without hesitation.

“Just you?” Sun Mengru’s eyes flashed with cold light. Her golden sword erupted in a blinding glow, charging toward the four without fear.

Fu Xingxuan’s eyes also turned cold. She became a streak of violet light, following Sun Mengru like the Nine Heavens’ Goddess, rushing toward the four.

“Divide two of you to block these two!” Yu Fanta and the others exchanged glances. They felt a threat from both women.

“Star Moon Divine Clan’s princess, stay still!” Jin Xixi smiled. His flames surrounded Fu Xingxuan instantly, and he clashed with her.

Jin Xixi’s goal was simple. Though he hated Luotian, Star Moon Divine Clan and the Golden Crow Clan were allies. If Fu Xingxuan fought another and was wounded or killed, it would harm the alliance. Jin Xixi knew even without him, Luotian’s current state couldn’t escape the three others’ ambush.

“You’re Luotian’s wife, aren’t you? That bastard has good luck. Too bad it’s me who gets to enjoy her first!” Hun Badan smiled, extending a finger. His Supreme Finger pressed toward Sun Mengru.

“Die!” Sun Mengru’s face turned icy. Her sword erupted with radiant light, slicing a divine blade toward his finger.

“Boom!” The golden blade collided with the thick finger. It shattered instantly, sending a violent wave outward.

“Today, you must die!” Yu Fanta’s face was grotesque. He remembered his near-death experience. If not for the Yu Clan’s depth and supreme methods to nurture his soul, he would have perished.

White wings flapped endlessly. Blades formed behind Yu Fanta, creating a storm that devoured the void and surged toward Luotian.

“Come!” Seeing Yu Fanta’s attack, Luotian’s current state couldn’t withstand it. Sun Mengru shouted and hurled her sword, then formed seals. Her golden sword split into two, four… until it transformed into a dragon of blades, rushing toward the storm.

At the same time, Sun Mengru’s feet flashed with wind. She pressed her hands down, and the Divine King Nine Heavens Map crashed toward Yu Fanta. She aimed to fight two at once.

“Little girl, you forgot about me!” But Sun Mengru had forgotten who she faced. An ancient heir—none were weak. While she blocked Yu Fanta, Hun Badan appeared before her, his gray fist shattering the stars and slamming into Sun Mengru’s abdomen.

“Puke!” Blood spewed. Sun Mengru was thrown back, her face pale as she coughed up blood.

“Mengru!” Luotian’s face changed. His body seemed ignited, and he rushed toward Yu Fanta.

“Don’t come!” But before Luotian moved, Sun Mengru shouted. She waved her hand, and the Qiankun Zhenn魂 Tower flew from her palm. It expanded instantly, enveloping Luotian in a powerful barrier.

“Hum…” Gray energy spread. The tower’s barrier made Luotian’s face dark.

“Little Qian!” Sun Mengru called to the tower. At the same time, Little Qian emerged from it, his face obscured but clear when he saw Sun Mengru’s blood. He cried out: “Sister!”

“Little Qian, help him recover!” Sun Mengru ordered. She wiped her mouth and rushed toward Hun Badan again.

“Epoch Relic, Immortal Medicine!” Upon the tower and Little Qian’s appearance, Yu Fanta and Xue Shengfei’s faces shifted.

“And it’s an immortal medicine that has taken human form!” Xue Shengfei exclaimed, recognizing Little Qian’s origin.

“Indeed, I underestimated you!” Hun Badan’s gaze on Sun Mengru changed. Those who possessed an Epoch Relic and immortal medicine were surely blessed.

“Recover well. I’ll handle the rest!” Sun Mengru’s face softened as she watched Luotian trapped in the tower. She turned, sword in hand, and rushed toward Hun Badan again.

“Damn!” Luotian stood within the tower, his face dark. He knew Sun Mengru’s intention.

The Qiankun Zhenn魂 Tower was an Epoch Relic. If Sun Mengru activated it, it might kill two or three of them. But she would also exhaust herself. Thus, Sun Mengru chose to protect Luotian with the tower. With Little Qian’s immortal medicine, Luotian would recover quickly. Once he did, with their combined strength and the tower, they could break free of the four’s ambush.

But this feeling of being behind his woman made Luotian deeply uncomfortable.

“Sister, let me help you recover!” Little Qian’s voice echoed in Luotian’s ears. Luotian’s eyes cleared, and he nodded.

“Sorry, Little Qian!” Luotian said with regret. He knew fully recovering would harm Little Qian.

“Don’t worry, I’ll compensate you later!” Luotian whispered. Now was not the time for sentimentality. He moved his hands, and seals of divine chains flew from him, wrapping around Little Qian’s body to draw his life force and energy.

“Together, break the Epoch Relic’s defense. We’ll decide the division later!” Yu Fanta observed the tower’s barrier, his eyes grim. He addressed Xue Shengfei, who had only fought once.

“Good!” Xue Shengfei nodded. No one would ignore an Epoch Relic and a human-form immortal medicine, especially ancient heirs aiming for enlightenment. They needed the immortal medicine.

Chapter 1530: Seal Unlocked

Xue Shengfei and Yu Fanta exchanged glances. They acted immediately, sensing the tower’s power. An Epoch Relic’s defense was not easily broken.

But despite its strength, they were confident in breaking it.

“Hum…” Yu Fanta moved his hands, radiating holy light. Golden feathers coalesced into a sword of creation, hovering above his head.

On the other side, Xue Shengfei’s face was cold. His hands moved, and a blood-red palm formed above his head.

“Too strong!” Jin Zitao and Jin Ziming stood before Tu Feiyang, who was breaking the seals. Their eyes were awestruck as they watched Yu Fanta and Xue Shengfei, and the clash between Sun Mengru and Fu Xingxuan.

“Go!” Xue Shengfei and Yu Fanta’s faces were cold. They spoke in unison, extending their hands. Their techniques unleashed overwhelming might, slamming toward the Qiankun Zhenn魂 Tower.

Luotian stood beneath the tower. His body connected with Little Qian via white divine chains. Meanwhile, his body roared as nine Reincarnation Immortal Bodies formed in his dantian, gradually solidifying.

“Ah… so tired…” Little Qian’s face showed exhaustion. He yawned constantly, as if ready to fall asleep.

“Crack!” As Luotian recovered, the golden sword of creation smashed against the gray barrier. Luotian’s body trembled violently. The Reincarnation Immortal Bodies nearly shattered from the collision.

“Killed me!” Little Qian, drowsy and about to fall asleep, jolted awake at the collision. He shouted at Yu Fanta and Xue Shengfei outside the barrier.

But when he saw Xue Shengfei’s blood energy, his timid nature made him shiver. He flew to Luotian’s side.

“Don’t fear…” Luotian comforted him, gazing at Xue Shengfei’s blood palm after Yu Fanta’s attack. His eyes were wary.

“Boom!” The thunderous sound echoed as the blood palm smashed against the gray barrier. Luotian’s face paled again, and the tower’s barrier cracked but quickly mended.

“Troubling!” Xue Shengfei shook his head. His hands formed seals, and a terrifying wave radiated from him. Yu Fanta also began to gather his attack.

“Little Qian, I need to speed up. It might be painful!” Luotian saw their attacks again and the ongoing battle between Sun Mengru and Hun Badan, as well as Fu Xingxuan against Jin Xixi. He grew anxious and sat cross-legged, pressing his hands to Little Qian’s back. A terrifying suction radiated from his hands.

Meanwhile, the battlefield between others echoed with powerful sounds. Jin Xixi and Fu Xingxuan were manageable—Jin Xixi didn’t want to harm Fu Xingxuan, so he held back. Fu Xingxuan was anxious but couldn’t escape Jin Xixi’s overwhelming strength.

Compared to Jin Xixi and Fu Xingxuan, Sun Mengru and Hun Badan’s battle was far more dangerous. Both aimed to kill the other, so their attacks were ruthless.

Sun Mengru radiated golden light. Her Taiyi Divine Body’s power was fully revealed. Since marrying Luotian, she had remained unnoticed, making people forget she was a prodigy of the nine divine bodies.

“Crack!” A gray and golden light collided. Sun Mengru and Hun Badan appeared beneath the stars.

Sun Mengru was bloodied, her shoulder nearly shattered by Hun Badan’s punch. She looked battered.

Hun Badan wasn’t better off either. His stomach bled from Sun Mengru’s sword, with剑气 raging inside his body.

“Unexpectedly, a human. Besides Luotian, there’s still one like you. That’s surprising!” Hun Badan sighed, shaking his body. The剑气 burst out, scattering into the void.

“Humans? Any clan’s heir or disciple can kill you!” Sun Mengru scoffed. Though she had been in dire straits, she knew about that battle from Luotian.

“You dare to provoke us?” Hun Badan’s face darkened. That battle was the humiliation of the ancient clans after the Heavenly Destroyer and Sky-Devouring Lord had subdued them. The ancient clans wanted to crush humans but were wiped out by human prodigies and three great elders. They had to compromise.

In that battle, the Taiyi Divine Lord’s heir Zhong Zixuan and the Demon God Lord’s heir Xuan Yuanqiong had overwhelmed them.

Now Sun Mengru was rubbing salt into Hun Badan’s wound. How could he bear it? His aura surged violently.

“Little girl, I’ll make you suffer every night!” Hun Badan shouted. His body became a giant beast, rushing toward Sun Mengru. As he flew, gray energy spilled from him, forming strange seals on his body—Hun Tian Clan’s Royal Technique: Bo Tian.

At the moment the gray seals were etched, Hun Badan’s speed increased by two tiers. He appeared before Sun Mengru instantly. Even she was caught off guard, hastily stabbing her sword at him.

“Crack!” The golden sword bent. Sun Mengru’s face turned pale. Her white hand glowed, striking Hun Badan.

“Little girl, against Bo Tian, your flesh and blood can’t match me!” Hun Badan sneered. His other fist collided with Sun Mengru’s.

“Crack!” The stars exploded. Next moment, Sun Mengru’s entire arm turned into blood mist and was thrown back.

“Again!” Hun Badan laughed, seeing Sun Mengru wounded. He didn’t give her time to recover and rushed toward her.

“Hum…” Sun Mengru’s body was thrown back. Her arm, destroyed, regenerated instantly through the Divine King Regeneration Technique. She stared in shock—no one else could overpower a divine body like this.

“One Strike to the Primordial!” Sun Mengru wasn’t ordinary. Knowing her flesh and blood couldn’t match Hun Badan’s royal technique, she unleashed a martial art.

“Hum…” The golden sword hummed. It hovered above her head, and golden seals erupted from it, piercing into the stars. A terrifying wave surged through these seals into the sword.

Cold light flashed. The golden sword erupted with a blinding chill, moving instantly to strike Hun Badan.

“Puke!” Blood splattered. The golden sword pierced through Hun Badan’s fist, exiting from his shoulder and vanishing into the void.

“What happened!” Jin Zitao and Jin Ziming, watching the battlefield, were shocked. They hadn’t expected Hun Badan’s powerful flesh and blood to be pierced so easily by Sun Mengru.

“What power?” Hun Badan’s face changed. His mouth bled, clearly wounded by that strike.

“Die!” Sun Mengru stood amidst the shattered stars. Her robes fluttered, and a golden sword replica hovered above her head. She extended her hand again, and the sword vanished.

“Boom!” Thunderous sounds echoed. Man Hun’s tall figure slowly stood up, howling at the sky.

“My seal is broken!” Man Hun’s face was wild. He looked at Luotian, still recovering beneath the Qiankun Zhenn魂 Tower.

“Man God’s Wrath Shatters Nine Heavens!” Man Hun took a step forward. Instead of helping Yu Fanta break the tower, he directly stepped on Hun Badan’s body, crushing the sword aimed at him.

But the sword was too fast. Man Hun only touched it briefly, and the golden sword flew from his feet toward Hun Badan.

“Damn, don’t interfere!” Hun Badan’s face darkened. He had sensed the sword’s direction and planned to block it. After all, he had been careless before. Now with preparation, though the attack was tricky, Hun Badan felt he could withstand it.

But Man Hun’s step changed the sword’s direction. It wasted his prepared defense.

“Puke!” Blood splattered. The sword, meant for Hun Badan’s heart, deviated and pierced his abdomen.

“Damn!” Hun Badan’s face turned pale. Two wounds had finally wounded him deeply.

“My seal is also broken!” Tu Feiyang, bloodied, stood up. He gazed at Luotian still seated beneath the tower.

Chapter 1531: Seal Broken

“Luotian, this time I’ll see if you die!” Tu Feiyang’s face was grotesque. Luotian had been his obsession since birth. He had always prospered until meeting Luotian, whose luck seemed to have run out. Every opportunity he had almost grasped was snatched by Luotian.

“Hum!” Blood light flashed. Tu Feiyang flew toward Xue Shengfei, his hands moving. He joined Xue Shengfei and Yu Fanta in attacking the tower’s barrier.

“Crack!” With Tu Feiyang’s addition, the Qiankun Zhenn魂 Tower’s barrier, already cracking under Xue Shengfei and Yu Fanta’s attacks, cracked faster.

Luotian sat within the tower. His eyes were closed, seemingly unaware of external events. His body emitted thunderous sounds. Nine Reincarnation Immortal Bodies in his dantian rapidly solidified.

“Too scary, they’re all villains!” Little Qian’s face was terrified. He watched the overwhelming techniques smashing the barrier and Sun Mengru, bloodied. His small body trembled.

Meanwhile, Sun Mengru faced danger. Though Man Hun had initially interfered, causing Hun Badan to be wounded, it wasn’t fatal. Hun Badan would recover quickly. With Man Hun’s help, they attacked Sun Mengru together, forcing her to retreat and suffer several heavy wounds. Fortunately, the Divine King Regeneration Technique was miraculous; otherwise, she might have died by now.

“Man God’s Five Steps Shake the World!” A golden foot slammed toward Sun Mengru, throwing her into the void.

“Enough!” Hun Badan’s face had a hint of smile. He sensed Sun Mengru’s direction in the void and extended his hand, summoning a gray sword.

“Eight Directions, I Alone Reign! One Strike Shatters Eight Directions!” Hun Badan’s face was cold. His gray sword slashed into the void, sending a terrifying blade toward Sun Mengru just as she stabilized.

“Primordial Dao Exists! One Thought Connects to the Primordial!” Sun Mengru felt intense danger in the gray blade. Her golden eyes narrowed, and she radiated an unusual aura.

Gray energy burst from her body. At the same time, her golden eyes turned gray, as if immersed in chaos. She became unusually calm.

“Hum…” The humming sound echoed. Gray energy enveloped her body, forming a gray armor that covered her, giving her an air of strength.

“Crack!” As the armor enveloped her, Hun Badan’s Eight Directions Blade smashed into her body.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” The void shattered. Gray energy surged from Sun Mengru’s front, and thunderous sounds echoed from the broken void.

“Dead yet?” Hun Badan smiled. He watched the storm subside, confident his strike would leave her wounded even if she survived.

“Crack!” As Hun Badan and the others watched the void, on the other side, the Qiankun Zhenn魂 Tower’s barrier shattered under Xue Shengfei, Tu Feiyang, and Yu Fanta’s combined attacks.

“Wake up! Hurry!” Seeing the barrier shatter, Little Qian’s face turned pale. He shouted at Luotian.

“Damn, so close!” Luotian’s face was dark. He still sat cross-legged beneath the tower, his eyes wild. The nine Reincarnation Immortal Bodies were nearly fully restored.

But Xue Shengfei, Tu Feiyang, and Yu Fanta gave him no time to breathe. Three terrifying waves formed in their hands.

“Divine Killing Needle!” Xue Shengfei waved his hand. A blood-colored needle hummed, forming a line of blood and vanishing from his hand.

Tu Feiyang also launched a needle. Alongside Xue Shengfei’s, they formed two fangs, radiating overwhelming coldness and bloodlust.

“Yu Emperor’s Sword!” Yu Fanta’s face was grotesque. He wouldn’t let Luotian catch his breath. His first strike was an execution—golden wings produced a silver feather, which surged toward Luotian.

“Luotian will surely be annihilated this time!” Jin Zitao and Jin Ziming smiled, watching their attacks. Their techniques were so overwhelming they felt despair. Each strike could kill them multiple times, let alone three combined.

Three Epoch Apex cultivators’ final strikes. Even at full strength, Luotian would find it challenging to withstand. Now he had recovered much but the three’s attacks were too fast. Almost instantly after the tower barrier shattered, they reached Luotian.

“Little Qian!” Luotian gritted his teeth. Little Qian was still before him; he couldn’t let a child die for him.

Time was critical. Luotian grabbed Little Qian and pulled him into his arms, turning to face the three attacks.

“No!” In the void, Sun Mengru’s figure appeared. Her face was grim but she couldn’t stop them in time. After all, Man Hun and Yu Fanta had already attacked her again.
