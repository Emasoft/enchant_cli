Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly, for he knew that congealing the elixir would consume even more spiritual awareness. Given Gu Qianxue's current state, Luo Tian could not help but feel concern.

Gu Qianxue cautiously merged the two medicinal liquids. After another hour, when Gu Qianxue persisted in adding the final drop of Black Moon Bone-Washing Grass elixir into the cauldron, a crackling sound erupted.

Gu Qianxue stared in shock at the shattered cauldron. She knew she had failed—her spiritual awareness was far too weak to merge even those dozen drops of elixir.

Luo Tian sighed softly and approached Gu Qianxue. "It's alright, there's still me!"

"Please rely on you!" Gu Qianxue gazed solemnly at Luo Tian. If Luo Tian failed again, there would be no path for Gu Lei to survive. The result was too terrifying for her to imagine.

Luo Tian said nothing more, retrieving the cauldron. He pressed his palm against the fire mouth, and a pale purple flame surged forth, engulfing one herb after another into the cauldron.

Gu Qianxue observed Luo Tian's technique, her eyes revealing a flicker of disappointment. Though his method was technically sound, it was evident he lacked experience in alchemy. Thinking this, she felt an urge to have Luo Tian stop and let her try again. Yet seeing the determination in his eyes, she merely sighed softly and stood silently.

Though Luo Tian's technique was somewhat clumsy, he was certainly no novice. Though it took longer than expected, he eventually extracted the medicinal liquid. The Black Moon Bone-Washing Grass was particularly difficult to refine, but Luo Tian's formidable spiritual awareness enabled him to succeed.

Luo Tian's forehead gradually broke into a sweat, yet his complexion was far better than Gu Qianxue's earlier state. This brought a flicker of hope back to Gu Qianxue, who had previously been despairing.

Luo Tian focused his mind entirely on the step Gu Qianxue had failed at—congealing the elixir.

"One hour, two hours..." A dark medicinal liquid floated within the cauldron, the result of merging over a dozen different elixirs. Next to it, an emerald medicinal liquid stood out as oddly mismatched.

Gu Qianxue knew this was the most critical moment. She clenched her white fists, silently praying.

Luo Tian's eyes flashed with madness as he bellowed, "Congeal!"

Spiritual awareness guided the two liquids into a violent collision. Upon contact, Luo Tian's spiritual awareness felt an immense repulsion force, leaving him momentarily unprepared.

Luo Tian sensed a wave of weakness in his mind. His eyes were bloodshot, and his face was pale—clearly, his spiritual awareness had overexerted.

"Buzz..." A continuous rumbling sound emanated from the cauldron.

"Crack..." After enduring prolonged torment, the cauldron could no longer withstand the pressure. It was on the verge of shattering.

Luo Tian naturally understood that if the cauldron shattered, all his efforts would be in vain—just like Gu Qianxue's failure.

He bit down hard on his tongue, forcing himself to stay alert. A streak of blood trickled from the corner of his mouth.

"I cannot let Gu Lei die! Congeal! Congeal!" Luo Tian roared desperately, releasing a stream of medicinal fragrance.

Gu Qianxue also clenched her fists tightly, staring intently at the cauldron before Luo Tian. Her heart silently prayed.

"Crack..." The cauldron finally gave way, exploding at that very moment. Yet as it did, several dark pills shot forth.

Luo Tian acted swiftly, grabbing a jade bottle and quickly collecting the pills.

Gu Qianxue heard the explosion's sound. Her heart felt as if it had shattered, but when she saw the dark pills flying out, her eyes lit up with excitement.

Chapter 24: Detoxification

Gu Qianxue could not contain her joy, hugging Luo Tian tightly while shouting, "Success! Success! Ha ha!"

Yet Luo Tian only felt a fragrance enter his nose, and a warm body rubbing against his chest.

Both were drenched in sweat, pressed closely together as if wearing nothing. Luo Tian only then realized he could clearly see what Gu Qianxue wore underneath, causing him to feel dry-mouthed.

After Gu Qianxue calmed down, she realized she was still pressed against Luo Tian. Seeing his red face, she shouted and ran away blushing.

Luo Tian watched Gu Qianxue's retreating figure, a strange feeling rising within him. He recognized this sensation—this was the same one he had felt when with Chen Yunting.

Thinking of Chen Yunting, Luo Tian's gaze became hazy. He murmured softly, "I wonder how you're doing... Hmph! In half a year, wait for me on Feiyun Mountain. I'll let you know your decision was wrong!"

Luo Tian set aside his scattered thoughts and walked toward the room.

...

By evening, Gu Lei had been unconscious for two days. His body looked thinner, and black energy could be clearly seen spreading from his chest outward.

Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue stood by the bed, gazing at the unconscious Gu Lei. Neither looked at each other; an awkward silence filled the air.

Luo Tian broke the silence first. "Let's detoxify him first!"

"Ah!" Gu Qianxue nodded slightly and said nothing more, leaving Luo Tian in an awkward situation.

Luo Tian took out the jade bottle and pried open Gu Lei's mouth, placing the pill inside.

As the pill entered his mouth, a wave of coldness rose from Gu Lei's body. Luo Tian instinctively shivered, his eyes fixed on Gu Lei, fearing any unexpected occurrence—after all, he had never taken the bone-washing pill before.

Gu Qianxue also watched anxiously, her face's flush long gone. She had returned to her usual sharp and resolute self.

After the coldness rose, Gu Lei let out a soft sigh. He had clearly suffered greatly from the poison over these two days, and the black energy in his meridians gradually lightened. It visibly gathered toward his chest at an observable pace.

After a quarter of an hour, the black energy fully converged in his chest. A complete mass of darkness slowly moved upward toward his throat.

"Gag..." Gu Lei opened his mouth wide, vomiting out a dark, foul-smelling blood.

Luo Tian quickly pulled Gu Qianxue behind him to prevent the black blood from splashing onto her.

Gu Qianxue, pulled by Luo Tian's cold grip, had not yet reacted. She felt a man's presence behind her. Looking at Luo Tian's back, she recalled the day outside Tianyuan City—this was the same unimposing back that had saved her multiple times.

Seeing Gu Lei's complexion visibly improved, Luo Tian felt relieved. However, Gu Lei still did not awaken, continuing to keep his eyes closed. This puzzled Luo Tian.

Gu Qianxue was also confused—why had the poison left his body, yet he still remained unconscious? Her relief faded as she grew anxious again.

Seeing Gu Qianxue's worried gaze, Luo Tian reached out to feel Gu Lei's wrist. He then let out a soft laugh. "Don't worry, he's fine. This kid is using the bone-washing pill to advance his cultivation!"

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Gu Qianxue finally felt at ease. She turned to clean up Gu Lei's vomit, then said goodbye to Luo Tian before heading to her room.

"Haha!" The next morning, a long laugh shattered the village's tranquility.

The early-rising rural couple was startled by this long laugh. As they stepped outside the courtyard, they saw a sight that left them stunned—yesterday's half-dead young man was now lively, breaking a tree trunk in front of his house with his bare hands.

"What? He's already at the fourth level of body refinement? Already showing off?" A light, feminine voice echoed. Gu Qianxue's figure instantly appeared before Gu Lei, her hand grabbing his ear.

"Ow... Sister! Sister!" Gu Lei howled in pain, unable to speak.

Luo Tian also stepped out of the courtyard. Seeing Gu Lei and Gu Qianxue, a smile flickered across his face.

Seeing Luo Tian step out, Gu Qianxue gently released her grip. Her mind involuntarily recalled the previous day's ambiguous scene, and her face turned red again.

Gu Lei stared wide-eyed at his sister. He rubbed his eyes to confirm he wasn't mistaken. "Sister! You actually blushed?"

"Go away..." Gu Qianxue, hearing this, snapped back to reality. She quickly returned her hand and grabbed Gu Lei's ear again. Gu Lei let out another agonizing wail.

After breakfast, the three gave the couple a spiritual stone. Under their endless expressions of gratitude, they left.

It wasn't that Luo Tian didn't want to give more; he feared too much wealth might bring the couple danger.

The three walked along the road to Wuxing Sect. They glanced back at Xuantian City, their eyes cold—clearly not willing to let this go. However, they lacked the strength for now.

Wuxing Sect was located on Wuxing Mountain. Legends said its first sect master had immense power, unifying the northern part of Tianyuan Continent alone. He stood against other major sects without ever losing.

Wuxing Sect accepted disciples regardless of wealth or status. If one had talent, they could join Wuxing Sect. Because of this, the sect's members were complex and numerous, earning it the title of Tianyuan's largest sect.

Every March 1st was Wuxing Sect's recruitment day. Even becoming an outer disciple could let one walk proudly in the northern cities. Naturally, Wuxing Sect's rules were strict; disciples weren't allowed to cause trouble in the secular world without permission.

At that moment, Wuxing Mountain was bustling with traffic. Vehicles formed groups and stayed at the mountain's base.

The most eye-catching were several luxurious carriages. Their guards were well-trained, and the young men inside wore arrogant expressions.

Zhang Qi was especially excited today. Today he would become a Wuxing Sect disciple. Though his cultivation wasn't great, he had an older cousin who was an inner disciple at Jin Guang Peak. Through various connections, Zhang Qi managed to get into Wuxing Sect.

Luo Tian, Gu Qianxue, and Gu Lei looked at the black mass of people. They were stunned. Though they had some expectations, they hadn't anticipated Wuxing Sect's recruitment being so火爆.

They followed the crowd to the base of Wuxing Mountain. Luo Tian saw the sons of several city lords at the front and let out a quiet laugh.

He had tricked them just days ago by pretending to be at the bone-fragment stage. He wondered what they would think if they knew he was merely a cultivator at the fifth level of body refinement.

Chapter 25: The Ascending Stairs

At noon, an old man stood at the wide gate of Feiyun Sect and announced loudly, "Everyone, I am Master Kong Deming, an outer sect elder of Wuxing Sect. Today is our disciple recruitment day!"

First, I will introduce the basic requirements for recruitment: "Those with cultivation below the third level of body refinement and over twenty years old may leave directly!"

Master Kong Deming stood there, appearing frail. However, those who knew him dared not underestimate him—his aura carried a hint of the bone-fragment stage.

Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly upon seeing Kong Deming. He silently marveled at Wuxing Sect's strength—just an outer sect elder was already at the bone-fragment stage. This surpassed Feiyun Sect he had previously stayed in by a significant margin.

Upon hearing Kong Deming's words, only a few people left. After all, Wuxing Sect had always recruited disciples annually with the same rules.

"Alright, now please proceed to the first test!" Kong Deming saw most people had left. He extended his hand, pointing toward a towering stairway beside him.

"This stairway is called the Ascending Stairs! Those who reach two hundred levels may enter outer sect selection. Reaching four hundred levels allows entry into inner sect selection. Reaching eight hundred levels may earn the favor of inner sect elders to become their disciples. Those who reach over nine hundred levels will surely be personally taken in by the sect's peak masters! Alright, young people. Go on—whether you can enter Wuxing Sect depends entirely on your own efforts!" Kong Deming waved his hand, signaling people to begin.

Upon hearing Kong Deming's words, the crowd moved toward the towering Ascending Stairs.

Zhang Qi mingled among the crowd with ease, gazing around. Many female disciples had also come for the test. He wasn't worried about being eliminated—he had already prepared beforehand and was confident he could reach two hundred levels.

As Zhang Qi continued to comment on the beauty or ugliness of the female disciples participating in the test, he suddenly spotted Luo Tian and the other two.

Upon seeing Luo Tian, Zhang Qi's body trembled involuntarily. His legs had almost been crippled before; he was fortunate to have obtained a pill through his father's efforts, which healed his legs. He had also used the pill to elevate his cultivation to the third level of body refinement—otherwise, he wouldn't have had a chance to enter Wuxing Sect.

However, Zhang Qi quickly sneered. "Hmph! You're here too, kid. Although I can't do anything to you, my cousin is an inner disciple. I don't believe a lowly fifth-level body refinement cultivator can beat him!"

Among the crowd, Luo Tian extended his spiritual awareness outward and noticed Zhang Qi. His eyes flashed with killing intent, but he didn't tell Gu Lei. With Gu Lei's impulsive nature, he might have directly approached Zhang Qi and killed him—after all, Gu Lei had almost died in Xuantian City.

Soon, a crowd arrived at the base of the towering Ascending Stairs. Though it could accommodate thousands, it didn't feel crowded.

People began to ascend the steps. Luo Tian was no exception; he and Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei stepped onto the stairs. As soon as they climbed the first step, a pressure immediately surged toward them—both their physical bodies and spiritual awareness felt oppression.

The first ten steps didn't have much pressure. Most of the crowd were at the third level of body refinement, so even those at the second level could reach the first hundred steps.

Luo Tian followed the crowd to the one-hundredth step. His brows furrowed slightly. This Ascending Stairs felt strange, but he couldn't yet determine why.

As people advanced toward the two-hundredth step, some began to struggle. Those with weaker third-level body refinement gradually gave up and sat on the steps, unable to get up.

Once they sat too long, Wuxing Sect disciples in uniforms would come and carry them down from the Ascending Stairs.

Zhang Hongyun, the young lord of Wen Tian City, remained calm. He reached the two-hundredth step quickly without a drop of sweat. His face showed confidence. As one of the top figures in nearby cities, his goal today was over eight hundred steps.

He glanced at others who might threaten him and took a deep breath, moving upward.

When Luo Tian reached the two-hundredth step, he noticed the crowd had thinned by about a tenth. He was puzzled—how could Zhang Qi, that fool, still reach the two-hundredth step?

Suppressing his pressure, Luo Tian extended his spiritual awareness toward Zhang Qi. He discovered a faint blue glow emanating from Zhang Qi's chest, barely noticeable without close inspection.

"Yellow-grade defensive equipment?" Luo Tian guessed that Zhang Qi must have carried a yellow-grade defensive item. Otherwise, based on his understanding of Zhang Qi, he wouldn't have reached the two-hundredth step.

Although Zhang Qi had a yellow-grade defensive item, he was still under immense pressure. His legs trembled as he climbed the two-hundredth step, finally giving in and sitting on the steps to catch his breath.

Luo Tian's lips curled into a smirk. Though his spiritual awareness was under pressure, he could still release it. He凝聚 a spiritual awareness and fiercely collided with Zhang Qi.

"Ahh..." Zhang Qi felt intense pain in his head. His body involuntarily tilted backward. As he was already sitting, he rolled down the stairs like a ball.

Master Kong Deming felt a cold killing intent behind him. He saw disciple Zhang Daoyi's eyes flash with coldness. Following Zhang Daoyi's gaze, he spotted Zhang Qi rolling down the stairs.

"Is this your cousin?" Kong Deming asked softly.

Zhang Daoyi didn't dare to delay. "Yes, he's the one I mentioned earlier—this useless cousin of mine!"

"Oh, then this first test counts as passed. As for the following tests, you handle it yourself!" Kong Deming said indifferently.

Hearing Kong Deming's words, Zhang Daoyi was overjoyed. Clearly, Kong Deming had tacitly accepted Zhang Qi's backdoor entry.

However, Luo Tian didn't know he had only disciplined Zhang Qi, but it had unintentionally created a big trouble for himself.

Luo Tian ignored the fallen Zhang Qi. Gu Lei and Gu Qianxue saw Zhang Qi, their eyes flashing coldly—especially Gu Lei. If it weren't for the difficulty of descending and reascending, Gu Lei might have gone down to beat him. Although this was within Wuxing Sect, beating him a little would be acceptable.

The three continued forward. When they reached the three-hundred-and-fiftyth step, Gu Lei, the weakest among them, gradually struggled. His already plump body was drenched in sweat.

Luo Tian saw Gu Lei's condition and sighed inwardly. With his fourth-level body refinement, he had only reached three hundred steps—earlier, Luo Tian had observed that Gu Lei was among the middle to upper range of those participating in the test.

"Keep going. We're almost at four hundred. I have a feeling this Ascending Stairs is strange. Try to push as high as you can!" Luo Tian whispered.

"Right!" Gu Lei wiped his forehead, knowing he was the weakest among them. He gritted his teeth and continued upward.

Chapter 26: Carry You Up

"Three hundred seventy-seven!"

"Three hundred seventy-eight! Three hundred seventy-nine!" Gu Lei climbed step by step, but his feet felt heavier. The Ascending Stairs pressed on him, making it hard to breathe.

Luo Tian saw Gu Lei could no longer endure. He whispered, "Qianxue, support him from the side. Let's carry him to the four-hundredth step!"

"Right!" Gu Qianxue nodded softly, lifting one of Gu Lei's arms. Luo Tian took the other. The two lifted Gu Lei upward.

"Wow! This is allowed? Isn't this cheating!" A group of people watching the three moving upward shouted in disbelief.

"This is cheating! We protest!" Some people sitting around the three-hundredth step shouted loudly.

"Hmph! Are you questioning our Wuxing Sect?" Kong Deming coldly snorted. No one dared to speak after that.

Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue carried Gu Lei up to the four-hundredth step. As soon as they set him down, he collapsed onto the steps and couldn't get up. A streak of blood seeped from his skin.

"Try to stay a little longer!" Luo Tian said again, then went upward with Gu Qianxue.

Over four hundred steps had only left a dozen people. Zhang Hongyun was still first, followed by a black-cloaked youth. The two were evenly matched around the six-hundredth step, neither yielding.

Others were scattered across various steps.

"Feng Xiong, it's really you. Looks like we'll compete again today! Remember the last match was two years ago!" Zhang Hongyun smiled lightly, but his steps didn't stop.

"Hmph! Zhang Hongyun, I've already lost once. I won't lose again today!" The man called Feng Xiong growled, his steps gradually speeding up.

Below, people watching the two's increased speed felt admiration. "Truly a genius! Reaching over six hundred steps and still moving so fast! Alas..."

"Hey, do you know who they are? The first one is Zhang Hongyun, the young lord of Wen Tian City. The second is Feng Qianyu, the young lord of Fengyu City. They've been competing for a long time. It's said two years ago, Feng Qianyu lost to Zhang Hongyun by a single move. He's been bitter since then. Looks like these two will be the most outstanding today!" Two young men sitting on the three-hundredth step waiting for others to carry them chatted.

Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue moved steadily toward the five-hundredth step. Only about ten people were ahead of them.

At this point, Gu Qianxue also struggled to continue. Sweat dripped from her forehead, but she gritted her teeth and persisted. After all, Gu Qianxue was still at the fourth level of body refinement—her rank was far behind others.

Seeing Gu Qianxue struggling, Luo Tian quickly stepped up a level and turned back. "Come on, I'll carry you to the six-hundredth step!"

"Come on, I'll carry you to the six-hundredth step." Hearing Luo Tian's light words, Gu Qianxue was momentarily stunned. She didn't understand what he meant at first. But after realizing, her face flushed: "No, you—just go ahead. I'll walk up on my own!"

"Although I don't know what this Ascending Stairs is currently doing, I have a feeling that the higher you climb, the more benefits it brings!" Luo Tian said seriously.

Seeing Luo Tian's persistence, Gu Qianxue hesitated. She looked at his eyes and noticed they were unusually clear. Gu Qianxue bit her lip, then extended her hand to wrap around Luo Tian's neck.

Though Gu Qianxue was light, this was on the Ascending Stairs. Luo Tian alone bore the pressure of two people and felt slightly strained. He slowly climbed upward.

"Wow! Is there no law anymore? This is allowed too! That kid's a human or a变态? First, carrying people, now he's even carrying someone! How are we supposed to live?" A commotion arose.

People were shocked, watching Luo Tian. They hadn't expected him to be so strong—carrying a person at the five-hundredth step. Although the woman on his back was beautiful, it wasn't like he was showing off so much.

Kong Deming and Zhang Daoyi saw Luo Tian's actions, their eyes narrowing. Carrying someone up the Ascending Stairs was unprecedented in years.

Kong Deming was also shocked by Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue's strength. Gu Qianxue, at the fourth level of body refinement, had already reached this far—this was truly abnormal.

Luo Tian was even more abnormal. Up to now, he had no signs of spiritual energy—completely like an ordinary person. That meant Luo Tian was walking solely with his physical body, without using any spiritual energy within him.

Kong Deming didn't know that one was a dual-element body type of fire and wood, while the other was the legendary Five Elements Body.

Gu Qianxue lay on Luo Tian's back, a sense of happiness rising within her. Though she didn't know why Luo Tian insisted on taking her higher, she knew he wouldn't harm her.

Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu turned back, watching Luo Tian carrying someone. They felt a sense of admiration. If this person hadn't carried anyone, he might have been a competitor. But now, there was no need to take him seriously.

Luo Tian's forehead broke into a sweat. He climbed step by step, ignoring others' gazes. His mind was intensely focused—his eyes seemed to see only the steps.

"Five hundred ninety-eight! Five hundred ninety-nine! Six hundred!" Luo Tian roared, placing Gu Qianxue on the six-hundredth step.

Gu Qianxue felt a pang of sympathy for Luo Tian. She didn't know what to say.

As soon as Luo Tian set Gu Qianxue down, he felt a sudden relief. He sensed his physical body had become stronger.

Luo Tian's mind sparked with inspiration, finally understanding the unique aspect of the Ascending Stairs: "Originally, this Ascending Stairs has a body-refining effect. The higher you climb, the stronger your physical body becomes when you descend!"

Thinking this, Luo Tian took out a wash-bone pill from his sleeve and placed it in Gu Qianxue's hands. He whispered, "Eat it. If you can go higher, do so. This Ascending Stairs has a body-refining effect—higher means more significant results!"

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Gu Qianxue was stunned. She marveled at Wuxing Sect's depth—such things could be created. Without hesitation, she swallowed the wash-bone pill.

Seeing Gu Qianxue eat the wash-bone pill, Luo Tian looked up at the four people ahead. Though he didn't know all of them, he had seen three of them during the previous visit to Xuantian City.

He took a deep breath, releasing his cultivation. He stepped onto the six-hundred-and-first step.

"My god! This kid isn't human at all! Did you see he's only at the fifth level of body refinement? Didn't he use any spiritual energy?" A person at the fifth level of body refinement, jealous and yelling.

"Seems like it!" His companion looked at Luo Tian with eyes like those of a monster.

Chapter 27: Catching Up to Your Steps

"Who is he? Which city's young lord? Why haven't we heard of him?" People immediately began speculating about Luo Tian's identity.

Gu Lei had already been carried down. He watched Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue on the stairs, his eyes filled with pride. He thought if he shouted now, "This is my sister and brother," would people immediately surround him?

Luo Tian, however, didn't hear the murmurs of the crowd. He released his cultivation slowly upward, gazing at Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu reaching the seven-hundred-and-fiftieth step. He smiled faintly and chased after the fourth place.

"This kid is about to overtake the fourth!" The crowd murmured in surprise.

The fourth place had stopped at the seven-hundredth step, sitting on the steps. Seeing Luo Tian ascend, his eyes showed resentment—resentment at being defeated by this unknown kid. But his legs felt like they weren't his own, and he couldn't move.

Luo Tian slowly stepped onto the seven-hundredth step. The pressure increased several times. Reaching the seven-hundredth step was already near his limit, but he gritted his teeth and continued upward.

"Seven hundred twenty-one! Seven hundred twenty-two! Seven hundred twenty-three!" Luo Tian muttered the step count, his face flushed. He suppressed the urge to vomit blood, with streaks of blood seeping from his pores.

Normally, Luo Tian's body and cultivation could reach the seven-hundred-fiftieth step without issue. But carrying Gu Lei once and carrying Gu Qianxue once had cost him significantly.

"This kid! He's truly abnormal! At the fifth level of body refinement, he can reach over seven hundred steps. How could we, who only reached five hundred steps, feel so pitiful? Fortunately, he stopped. If he continued upward, we could all commit suicide!" People saw Luo Tian finally stop and sighed in relief.

Seeing Luo Tian stop, Zhang Hongyun's eyes flashed with admiration. Reaching the seven-hundredth step at the fifth level of body refinement—this was something he himself couldn't achieve.

"Fourth place, that's not bad. But I don't want to embarrass my senior brothers!" Luo Tian smiled lightly, speaking in a barely audible voice.

The person sitting at the seven-hundredth step heard Luo Tian's words and widened his eyes. "This变态, does he really want to go higher?"

In the young man's shocked gaze, Luo Tian had a black pill in his hand—'Wash-Bone Pill!'

Luo Tian tossed the wash-bone pill into his mouth. He felt a cold sensation spread throughout his body.

"What is this kid doing?" People looked at Luo Tian in confusion. At this moment, even Luo Tian didn't notice that most people's gazes were focused on him. They were curious about this young man who had repeatedly surprised them.

Zhang Hongyun had already reached the seven-hundred-ninetyth step. His face no longer showed ease, but instead a slight struggle. His steps slowed, yet he still steadily climbed upward.

Feng Qianyu was the same—his forehead was drenched in sweat, tightly following behind Zhang Hongyun.

What surprised people was the third person. Like Luo Tian, he had no prior fame but now followed closely behind Feng Qianyu.

While Luo Tian was refining the wash-bone pill, an unexpected event occurred—there was a spiritual energy fluctuation at the six-hundredth step. It was very intense.

People turned their gaze to the six-hundredth step, where Gu Qianxue—this beautiful woman carried up to the six-hundredth step by Luo Tian—was now seated on the steps. Her long green robe, eyes closed, showed a serious expression.

Surrounding spiritual energy continuously converged toward Gu Qianxue. A red and green spiritual energy formed a visible spiritual vortex, entering her body.

As the spiritual energy entered Gu Qianxue's body, black impurities continuously seeped out of her.

Due to the pressure on the Ascending Stairs, these black impurities didn't touch Gu Qianxue's skin but were directly squeezed onto the steps.

After a quarter of an hour, the surrounding spiritual energy finally stopped entering Gu Qianxue's body. She opened her eyes, a look of joy on her face: "Body refinement level five!"

People below the Ascending Stairs were stunned, watching Gu Qianxue standing on the six-hundredth step. Their thoughts were filled with "This is impossible!"

People felt they had said this sentence the most today. They never expected anyone to break through under such intense pressure on the Ascending Stairs.

"Wait, didn't you notice his spiritual energy vortex earlier? It was two colors—green and red! Dual-element body type!" People exclaimed.

"Haha! I like this girl. No one else can compete with me!" In a secluded courtyard in the back of Wuxing Sect, an old man around fifty years old shouted to a group of people.

"Hmph! Old poisoner, a dual-element genius—who doesn't want it?" Another old man blew his nose and glared.

"Enough, you two. This is just the first test. There are still two more. You can argue later. It's been a long time since we've seen each other. Why start arguing immediately?" A woman-like figure said calmly.

"Exactly!" A chorus of agreement followed.

If Kong Deming were here, he would be surprised. The five peak masters of Wuxing Sect usually maintained strict authority—this was unlike their usual demeanor.

However, Gu Qianxue didn't know she had already caught the attention of these high-ranking peak masters. At this moment, her eyes were only on Luo Tian seated at the seven-hundred-twentieth step.

"I can't let you get too far ahead either!" Gu Qianxue's face was calm. She took a light step and ascended the six-hundred-and-first step...

"Wood-fire dual-element body type? Though unexpected, surpassing Zhang Hongyun is still challenging," Kong Deming thought, judging how high Gu Qianxue could reach.

"Look! That beauty has reached the seven-hundredth step!" People marveled at Gu Qianxue's strength. Many young men gazed lovingly at her.

"Unfortunately, she has a man. Otherwise, I'm so handsome, she would have fallen for me!" A tall young man said.

"Spit! Ugly self-admiration, why are there so many people like this!" The crowd responded with disdain.

At this moment, Gu Qianxue had already left a deep impression on people. She was naturally beautiful, her strength formidable, and her talent extraordinary—what more could one desire?

The young man sitting at the seven-hundredth step felt bitter. He had accepted that Luo Tian overtook him to fifth place, but with Gu Qianxue's arrival, he was pushed out of the top five.

Every year during Wuxing Sect's recruitment, those who reached the top five in the first test would be personally taken in by the peak masters. The young man struggled to stand but was crushed by the immense pressure, unable to move. He could only watch this beautiful woman pass before him, leaving a trail of fragrance.

Gu Qianxue passed the young man without even glancing at him. She stepped toward Luo Tian seated on the steps.

Chapter 28: Peak Masters

"Eight hundred!" Zhang Hongyun's forehead veins bulged, his breath labored as he stood on the eight-hundredth step, looking down at the crowd of Wuxing Sect.

But when his gaze fell on Feng Qianyu and the third-place person who had reached seven hundred eighty-five steps, his eyes narrowed. "These two are truly formidable opponents!"

"I won't lose to you again this time!" Feng Qianyu gazed at Zhang Hongyun, who stood high above. For Feng Qianyu, his only opponent was Zhang Hongyun.

"Unexpectedly, there are such talented youths in small cities!" The black-cloaked youth at third place sneered, then marched upward.

Gu Qianxue approached Luo Tian. She saw him meditating and refining the pill, not moving upward but sitting down to wait for him to finish.

Luo Tian was now desperately refining the wash-bone pill. Black substances fell from his skin. He could clearly feel his bones becoming crystalline and jade-like, with the medicinal energy continuously refining his meridians. There was no pain—only a cool sensation.

After the medicinal energy refined, Luo Tian opened his eyes and roared, "Body refinement level six! Open!"

A violent spiritual energy vortex formed around Luo Tian. He resembled a whale, absorbing surrounding spiritual energy into his body.

People below the Ascending Stairs watching the top three—Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu—felt a spiritual energy fluctuation. They turned their gazes toward Luo Tian.

At this moment, Luo Tian's long hair flowed in the wind. Beside him stood Gu Qianxue, a beauty beyond compare. The two seemed destined for each other.

After refining the wash-bone pill, Luo Tian's ordinary appearance had become somewhat handsome.

"Does this kid also want to break through?" People wondered, but soon laughed.

Breaking at seven hundred steps? Gu Qianxue's breakthrough at six hundred was already a miracle. Seven hundred? If Luo Tian succeeded, he would be too abnormal.

Luo Tian felt the spiritual energy here was insufficient. He also guessed it might be due to excessive pressure. However, he had no choice but to proceed.

"暂且不管那么多，总要试试才行。希望成功吧！"

Luo Tian sighed softly and continued absorbing.

"Wait! Look at his spiritual energy vortex!" Finally, some perceptive people noticed a shocking scene.
