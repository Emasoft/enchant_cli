“Indeed, it's worth it. The Heavenly Yuan Sect may lack top Immortal Kings, but its other strengths are formidable!” The sect masters of the middle heavens murmured among themselves, their eyes filled with envy.

“Would we be returning Fu Xingyang to us if we pledged allegiance to the Eastern Emperor Mountain?” As people clamored, Luo Tian spoke up, causing a brief pause.

Fu Xingyue's eyes flashed with gratitude; he had been worried about Fu Xingyang all along.

“Unlikely! We've allowed you to pledge allegiance without holding grudges, offering such generous conditions—this is already a great honor for you. Moreover, I must take him with me!” The middle-aged man coldly spoke, pointing his finger at Fu Xingyue.

“Who do you think you are? Do you truly believe the Heavenly Yuan Sect is easy to bully? Believe me, I'll make you stay today!” Luo Tian shouted, his voice laced with coldness.

“Don't test your luck—just leave him here! Let the Eastern Emperor Mountain exchange for him!” A furious shout echoed as Meng Wushuang and Lu Chong appeared, their auras oppressive.

“Good!” Luo Tian nodded. They were no longer the soft plums others could crush at will; even the nine immortal mountains would hesitate before acting against them.

“Good, I like this attitude. I've long disliked these people; I'll help you!” A sinister voice echoed as a powerful figure from the Ghost King Sect spoke.

“You!” The Eastern Emperor Mountain's cultivators' faces shifted slightly, their bodies retreating.

“Come forward!” Meng Wushuang slammed his hand, ruthlessly pressing down on the mid-stage immortal king.

“Thud… Thud…” Lu Chong instantly appeared, smashing down on the retreating cultivator with a hammer.

“Damn it!”

“Don't you fear causing damage to the Heavenly Yuan Sect?” The Eastern Emperor Mountain's cultivator roared, slapping his palm forward to clash with a crimson-handed fire master.

“Thud… Thud…” The Heavenly Yuan Mountain trembled, but since everyone's domain barriers were active, no major damage occurred.

“Open…” Wan Lingkong bellowed,一道道神光 rising from all directions of the Heavenly Yuan Mountain, encircling it completely.

“This is a month's worth of effort I've spent setting up—no girl even! Fight as much as you want; if you break a house, I'll lose!” Wan Lingkong shouted loudly.

“Peng…” No need to fight; Fire Master and Lu Chong were both at their peaks, especially remembering the grudge against Fu Tianhan. They held nothing back. Though the Eastern Emperor Mountain's cultivator was formidable, being besieged by Fire Master and Lu Chong, he couldn't withstand it. After a brief struggle, he was smashed to the ground by Lu Chong's hammer. The Eastern Emperor Mountain's young man fared worse, being smashed away by Yao Chen's staff and captured, his cultivation sealed. The ten sect masters watched as Pao Dezhu and others beat him mercilessly. The hundred sect masters' faces twitched; the nine immortal mountains' people had always been treated like ancestors, but this was their first time being beaten so pitifully.

"Arrogant? Descendant of the imperial family?" They cursed while fighting, watching the Heavenly Yuan Sect's disciples' blood boil. Lei Yong watched the beaten Eastern Emperor Mountain cultivator, his eyes flickering as he pulled Luo Tian forward.

"Brother, I have a project worth tens of millions—do you have interest?" Lei Yong rubbed his hands.

"No..." Luo Tian remembered how Lei Yong had once used him as a living advertisement, making people gawk at him for ages.

Luo Tian couldn't help but admire Lei Yong's ingenuity—just watching the Eastern Emperor Mountain's cultivator get beaten, he'd come up with a profit-making scheme. However, Luo Tian didn't want to get involved again.

"Next is the Eternal Life Mountain!" Luo Tian's gaze turned to the immortal mountain's cultivator, but that cultivator's face remained calm.

"Want to capture me too?" The immortal mountain's cultivator chuckled, gazing at Luo Tian and others.

"I didn't come here for revenge against Nie Yuntian. After all, I must thank you; without your help, I wouldn't have ascended!"

"I came here on my master's orders. Very sincerely inviting you to join the Eternal Life Mountain!" The middle-aged man spoke, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Deng Tianhua, do you think you'll succeed?" Jiang Taibai's eyes showed disdain as he spoke.

"Success depends on sincerity, right? I'm sure you'd be interested in this item!" Deng Tianhua spoke softly, waving his hand.

"Crack..." A thunderclap rose, lightning flashing in Deng Tianhua's hands before forming into a green long sword.

"Thunder Sword of the Dao!" Luo Tian almost shouted, Zhang Ziping and Lei Yong's faces showed disbelief. Before entering the immortal realm, Luo Tian had returned the Thunder Sword of the Dao to Zhang Daotian. The Thunder Sword of the Dao was a treasure, the most symbolic item of the Dao Sect. Zhang Daotian would never lose it.

But now, the Thunder Sword of the Dao—symbolizing the Dao Sect—was in the Eternal Life Mountain's hands. That was enough to indicate Zhang Daotian might have been captured by the Eternal Life Mountain.

"Is this sincerity enough?" Deng Tianhua lightly moved his Thunder Sword of the Dao, gazing at Luo Tian's astonished eyes with satisfaction.

"This is the Thunder Sword of the Dao!" Everyone gazed at Deng Tianhua's green long sword.

The Thunder Sword of the Dao seemed to have evolved, with lightning swirling around its blade, giving a powerful pressure.

"An ancient treasure of the Dao Sect!" People erupted in chaos, recalling an ancient and powerful sect.

"Join our Eternal Life Mountain! I'm sure you'll accept!"

"Of course, you can also deal with me as you did the Eastern Emperor Mountain. However, I'm unsure if my master would exchange someone for me!" The middle-aged man spoke, silencing Luo Tian's eager group.

Eternal Life Immortal King was ruthless and wouldn't risk anything for a single disciple.

Chapter 2417: A Thread of Divine Soul

Zhang Daotian, a person extremely important to Luo Tian, was his mentor. Throughout Luo Tian's journey, he had many benefactors; Zhang Daotian ranked among the top three.

Luo Tian clenched his fists, their creaking sound echoing as he stared at Deng Tianhua, his killing intent unhidden, making Deng Tianhua's heart tremble.

"The Heavenly Yuan Sect pledging allegiance to the Eternal Life Mountain is impossible. I'm not the sect's master, so I can't control its future. However, I can personally join the Eternal Life Mountain!"

"But only if he's returned! Don't ask who I am; you know it yourself!" Luo Tian coldly spoke, clearly offering himself in exchange for Zhang Daotian.

"Impossible!" Deng Tianhua immediately replied. He knew how important that person was to the Eternal Life Immortal King, so the Eternal Life Immortal King definitely wouldn't agree.

"If it's impossible, then I'll have to keep you here. After all, I'm going to the Eternal Life Mountain anyway; I'll kill enough to break even!" Luo Tian leapt into the air, his demonic aura surging without hesitation, slapping Deng Tianhua with a palm.

"You..." Deng Tianhua's face changed in shock, not expecting an attack. His hands flew, striking back with a palm that collided with Luo Tian's.

Thud... Deng Tianhua's body retreated, his palms cracked, his eyes filled with shock. One strike had made Deng Tianhua realize Luo Tian's reputation was well-earned; Nie Yuntian dying at Luo Tian's hands was no mistake.

"You're worse than your older brother!" Luo Tian sneered, stomping the ground and rushing toward Deng Tianhua again.

At the same time, Long Jie and Yao Chen rushed toward Deng Tianhua, their auras overwhelming. The pressure alone made Deng Tianhua's face change.

"Let's talk!" Deng Tianhua gave up resistance. One Luo Tian was already tough, let alone Long Jie and Yao Chen joining in.

"Speak!" Luo Tian's three halted their movements, gazing at Deng Tianhua. If Deng Tianhua said anything they disliked, they'd attack immediately.

The masters of the middle heavens watched Luo Tian nervously, admiration in their eyes. First capturing the Eastern Emperor Mountain's people, now attacking the Eternal Life Mountain. However, they understood—no matter which immortal mountain the Heavenly Yuan Sect pledged allegiance to, that mountain would protect it. Moreover, the Heavenly Yuan Sect's current strength was formidable; immortal kings at the late stage and peak could never descend from the upper heavens. Once they did, they'd be suppressed. Thus, even if several immortal mountains wanted to destroy the Heavenly Yuan Sect, they'd pay a heavy price—perhaps even be counterattacked by the Heavenly Yuan Sect.

"I can relay your words to my Eternal Life Immortal King, my master!"

"But whether he agrees depends on his decision!" Deng Tianhua spoke, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Okay," Luo Tian softly replied, waving his hand to send a pill to Deng Tianhua's front.

"Swallow it; you can leave!" Luo Tian coldly spoke, leaving Deng Tianhua no choice but to swallow it.

"Good!" Deng Tianhua didn't hesitate, swallowing the pill. He knew Luo Tian wouldn't kill him; Luo Tian and the Eternal Life Immortal King needed a contact, and he was that person.

"Leave the Thunder Sword of the Dao!" Luo Tian spoke again, making Deng Tianhua's body tremble. But he finally bit his teeth and handed the Thunder Sword of the Dao to Luo Tian.

"Who is Luo Tian related to the Dao Sect?" People immediately questioned, recalling how Luo Tian had become so decisive when Deng Tianhua revealed the Thunder Sword of the Dao.

"The descendant of the Dao Sect!"

"Someone from the Dao Sect remained after all!" People understood, their eyes filled with admiration but not spoken aloud.

"The Dao Sect produced Zhang Daotian before; now it's Luo Tian. Indeed, the nine immortal mountains!" Everyone gazed at Luo Tian.

Deng Tianhua turned to leave, his eyes filled with defeat. He had thought he'd have Luo Tian at his mercy but ended up almost being trapped.

"Done. Everyone, continue!"

"Also, our Heavenly Yuan Sect won't pledge allegiance to any immortal mountain!" Luo Tian watched Deng Tianhua leave, a smile on his face as he addressed the crowd.

"What?" Hearing Luo Tian's words, everyone's faces showed disbelief. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to make such a choice. Since the nine immortal mountains existed, this was the first time a sect had entered the middle heavens without choosing to pledge allegiance.

The Heavenly Yuan Sect, choosing to break this rule was truly bold.

"Right! Why be a dependent? We are the Heavenly Yuan Sect!" Pao Dezhu and Nan Gong Yuqing's eyes gleamed as they spoke loudly. Meng Wushuang and Lu Chong also showed admiration, surprised Luo Tian had said such words.

But these people were all independent spirits, naturally agreeing with Luo Tian's idea.

"Kid, think carefully!" Jiang Taibai frowned, unsure what Luo Tian was thinking. This move would certainly anger most of the Bu Tian Mountain.

"Really not considering us from the Jade Pool?"

"Sisi and Mengru are both disciples of our Jade Pool. The Jade Pool's rules state that marriage with sects outside the nine immortal mountains or not under our Jade Pool is forbidden!" Chen Min Tong hadn't expected Luo Tian to consider this.

"You're more and more likable, bold. I'll tell our Ghost King Master!" The Ghost King Sect's cultivator smiled, praising.

"Thank you all!"

"Then I'll just leave Sisi and Mengru here!" Luo Tian addressed Chen Min Tong, his voice carrying霸道.

"Bold! Really thinking yourself important? In front of the nine immortal mountains, your small Heavenly Yuan Sect is nothing!" Yue Yao spoke, her voice filled with anger.

"This matter I'll report!" Chen Min Tong saw through it; Luo Tian was breaking the rules, biting the bullet.

"Sorry, Jiang前辈!" Luo Tian felt most sorry for Bu Tian Mountain, after all, it had given him too much.

"It's okay. I'll tell my brother!"

"Also, you've now reached the early stage of Immortal King. You have the qualifications to meet your elders!" Jiang Taibai spoke to Luo Tian, making his heart tremble.

"Gu Tianshu!" Luo Tian's mind instantly conjured that invincible figure.

"Then I'll trouble you, elder!" Luo Tian bowed, not lingering further but pulling Jiang Sisi, Gu Qianxue, and Sun Mengru away. Chen Min Tong didn't stop them; she knew she couldn't, given their strength.

"Haha! Everyone continue drinking!" Pao Dezhu laughed, raising his cup. The grand ceremony continued; Heavenly Yuan Sect's disciples and elders were very happy, but the sect masters had no interest. The Heavenly Yuan Sect's actions would certainly anger the nine immortal mountains, and when they retaliated, they didn't want to be involved. The Heavenly Yuan Sect had exceeded the rules of the immortal realm.

Time passed, and the Heavenly Yuan Sect's founding ceremony ended in just two days. The nine immortal mountains and a hundred sects had left, but Luo Tian didn't depart; he waited for Deng Tianhua's response.

Days passed smoothly, time slowly flowing. Eight days later, Luo Tian and his group finally received Deng Tianhua's response.

But Deng Tianhua didn't come alone; he brought a soul, half of a divine soul.

A ghostly soul floated in the hall, recognizable as an old man's form. Luo Tian's eyes turned red, his fierce killing intent radiating from him. Deng Tianhua stood there, trembling, feeling the oppressive atmosphere in the hall, thinking he was likely doomed this time.

"Luo Tian, I relayed your words. But you know my master's nature, right?"

"I managed to get this half of the divine soul for you. My master is in a good mood! He said when you arrive at the Eternal Life Mountain, he'll hand over the remaining half!" Deng Tianhua smiled nervously, speaking carefully to Luo Tian.

"Master!" Luo Tian knelt on both knees, bowing respectfully to the drifting soul.

The gray divine soul wore a gentle smile, as if unconscious. But Luo Tian, the Soul Sealing Master, knew well that without this half of the soul, the other half would surely be severely damaged.

"This divine soul has been searched for memories!" Luo Tian thought, knowing the Eternal Life Immortal King might have already known his relationship with Zhang Daotian, thus having him at his mercy and concluding he'd go to the Eternal Life Mountain.

Luo Tian waved his hand, retrieving the soul and speaking to Deng Tianhua: "Three months later, I'll go to the Eternal Life Mountain!"

"Okay. Then I'll return to report to my master!" Deng Tianhua nodded quickly, leaving the hall under people's eyes ready to devour him, becoming a streak of light and exiting Heavenly Yuan Sect.

"I'm fine. Everyone go back!" Luo Tian smiled, addressing Pao Dezhu and others.

"Luo Tian, take it slow!" Nan Gong Yuqing spoke, knowing Luo Tian wanted solitude now and led everyone out of the hall, leaving it for Luo Tian alone.

Luo Tian watched them leave and took out Zhang Daotian's half of the divine soul again. His hands moved,一道道灰 light flying out from his hands, imprinting on Zhang Daotian's half of the divine soul.

The light flashed; Zhang Daotian's soul became more solid.

"Can't be separated for too long, a year?" Luo Tian muttered. Originally, Zhang Daotian's half of the soul couldn't be away from the other half for more than half a month. After this imprint, it extended to a year.

"Seems I must go to the Eternal Life Mountain!" Luo Tian sighed longingly, his eyes resolute as he began thinking.

For two days, Luo Tian didn't leave the hall until the third day when he stepped out and headed to his small courtyard.

Chapter 2418: Meeting a蛮魂

Luo Tian lived normally within the Heavenly Yuan Sect, spending time with his three wives, chatting and drinking with Pao Dezhu and others, occasionally guiding the sect's disciples in cultivation. Life was very warm.

Time flowed smoothly; Luo Tian lived like this for nearly a month. After that, he spent the next month training and constantly forging elixirs.

Every day, lightning strikes descended upon the Heavenly Yuan Sect, causing disciples to be terrified. They didn't know if it was because they'd become too comfortable or if Luo Tian's mindset had changed. His elixir art had risen to the level of a seven-star immortal elixir master. Seven-star immortal elixir masters were rare in the middle heavens and even more so in the upper heavens. Xuan Dan was now an eight-star, striving to break through to nine stars and was cherished by the Bu Tian Mountain.

Another month passed. That night, Luo Tian smiled, standing in his courtyard, gazing at the dark sky. He waved his hand, releasing Dahei and Erhei.

"Wang wang..." The two big dogs appeared, barking and approaching Luo Tian's front.

"From now on, you must protect the Heavenly Yuan Sect well. Got it?" Luo Tian smiled gently at the two dogs, his eyes soft. The three dogs had followed him for years, loyal and devoted; Luo Tian had long considered them family.

"I need to go out for a while. Having you two along is inconvenient!" Luo Tian gently patted the heads of the two dogs, speaking softly.

"Awo..." The two dogs hadn't transformed into human forms but had matured mentally, especially Dahei, who was already like an adult.

The two dogs naturally understood Luo Tian's meaning and kept biting his pants, emitting whining sounds.

"Okay, I'll return. It might take a year, or just several months!" Luo Tian smiled.

"Wang wang..." The two dogs barked twice and released his pants, standing still.

"Give these to them!" Luo Tian waved his hand, a storage ring falling before the three dogs.

Inside was all of Luo Tian's belongings. He kept only Longyuan Sword on his back, some elixirs and immortal crystals, and weapons like the Mo Ming Sword and Shouri Bow. He left everything behind because he no longer needed them.

"Bu Tian Stone, let's go!" Luo Tian spoke softly. He still planned to take the Bu Tian Stone; after all, this thing was excellent at escaping, and he could rely on it to flee.

"Let's go together. I'll accompany you; even if we're caught, it's just a head!" Bu Tian Stone's excited voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"You don't want to go, right?" Luo Tian frowned, instantly making Bu Tian Stone depressed.

"Kid, are you sure? The opponent is an immortal king at the peak. We're going to give him our heads!" Bu Tian Stone's voice echoed, thinking Luo Tian had gone mad.

"I didn't say I'm going now. I need to go to the Bu Tian Mountain first!" Luo Tian shook his head. He needed to meet Gu Tianshu.

Luo Tian could feel that Gu Tianshu's strength was definitely strong. If he could bring him to the Heavenly Yuan Sect for protection, it would surely stabilize the sect.

"That's good. I thought you were going to die!" Bu Tian Stone felt relieved after hearing Luo Tian's words.

"But after leaving the Bu Tian Mountain, I still need to go!" Luo Tian sighed deeply. He could wait, but Zhang Daotian's soul couldn't.

"You..." Bu Tian Stone was speechless, surprised Luo Tian was so stubborn.

"Okay!" Finally, Bu Tian Stone gave in. He had been with Luo Tian from hell to the immortal realm and knew his loyal and righteous nature, so he didn't persuade him.

Under the cover of night, Luo Tian flew away, disappearing from the Heavenly Yuan Sect. No one in the sect knew of his departure.

Under the night sky, Luo Tian's speed was fast. The Heavenly Yuan Sect's location wasn't far from Huantian City, and when the sun rose, Luo Tian saw the vast city of Huantian.

"Buzz..." But as Luo Tian was about to reach Huantian City, a figure rushed toward it from afar. His aura was chaotic, making Luo Tian pause slightly.

"蛮魂?" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed, instantly recognizing the tall figure and blocking its path.

The tall body radiated a powerful aura, half-step immortal king's cultivation. Seeing someone blocking his way, Manhun was surprised and realized he didn't know who it was. His face changed instantly.

"Move aside!" Manhun didn't hesitate, throwing a punch toward Luo Tian with his thick arm.

Luo Tian naturally wouldn't kill him immediately, so he extended a hand, encircling with his domain.

"Immortal King!" Manhun's face showed bitterness but still gritted his teeth, his arm suddenly expanding by two inches. His fist's momentum didn't stop.

"Thud..." Luo Tian stood still, blocking Manhun's fist. His heart praised Manhun's formidable physical strength.

"I'm not blocking you. I'm Luo Tian. What's going on?" Luo Tian, seeing Manhun throwing another punch, transmitted his voice.

"Luotian!" Hearing Luo Tian's name, Manhun's body trembled slightly, his eyes filled with joy as he looked at Luo Tian's restored face.

Manhun withdrew his fist and stood before Luo Tian: "Let's go first; there's no time for explanation!"

"Traitor Manhun, where do you think you're going?" As the two spoke, several whooshing sounds echoed. Several sturdy figures rushed toward their direction.

Three half-step immortal kings and seven true immortal peak cultivators, radiating powerful auras, instantly appeared before them, surrounding Luo Tian and Manhun.

"War God Sect?" Luo Tian looked at their clothes, his face showing confusion.

Manhun was known to the War God Sect. He had seen Manhun and Jin Xiyang during the Shenglong Sect's struggle for heaven. They had both done well in their respective sects.

Luo Tian hadn't expected Manhun to become like this, being chased and hunted so desperately. At that moment, Manhun's aura was formidable but his body had many wounds, deep enough to see bone.

"Kill..." Upon meeting, the War God Sect's people didn't speak a word but rushed toward Luo Tian and Manhun.

"Move..." Luo Tian frowned slightly, his aura instantly bursting out, pressing down on the ten people and making them freeze in place.

Luo Tian waved his hand, wind surged around, blowing the ten people into a pile before him and Manhun.

"Early stage of Immortal King!" Their faces changed in shock, gazing at Luo Tian with disbelief.

"What's going on? Explain!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice carrying authority, like a cold wind brushing over them.

"I lost the position of sect heir!" Manhun spoke softly. The War God Sect's rules were cruel, with the strong devouring the weak. Once he lost, he knew his fate wouldn't be good. Therefore, he immediately chose to leave the War God Sect. The new sect heir would definitely not allow Manhun, a powerful threat, to exist and would kill him.

Manhun had also thought about going to the Heavenly Yuan Sect but was too embarrassed to go in such a pitiful state. So he chose Huantian City, hoping for an opportunity to enter the upper heavens.

"Go back and tell Manhun has joined my Heavenly Yuan Sect!" Luo Tian addressed the ten people. His face had restored to Luo Tian's, and they were following orders. At this moment, the Heavenly Yuan Sect had enough enemies; Luo Tian didn't want to make more.

"Ten Thousand Heaven Sect!" Hearing Luo Tian's words, the ten people's faces changed in shock. They hadn't expected this person to be from the Heavenly Yuan Sect.

Where was the Heavenly Yuan Sect? It was currently at its peak, hailed as the first sect in the middle heavens. Though independent and not pledging allegiance to the nine immortal mountains, its strength was there.

"Luotian!" The ten people carefully observed and their breathing suddenly quickened, eyes filled with reverence as they gazed at Luo Tian. Who in the middle heavens didn't know Luo Tian's name? All sects had spread his image, warning not to provoke him.

"Buzz..." As everyone was stunned, Luo Tian had already sent a token to the ten people's front and took Manhun toward Huantian City. Within a quarter of an hour, the two flew into Huantian City and found a hotel to settle Manhun.

"You can go to the Heavenly Yuan Sect. The War God Sect's envoy is also there, but don't say you saw me!" Luo Tian spoke to Manhun. As for what Manhun chose, Luo Tian wouldn't interfere.

"Good!" Manhun wasn't a talkative person. Knowing Luo Tian had his ideas, he didn't say much and watched Luo Tian leave the hotel.

Luo Tian directly headed toward the upper heavens' transmission array.

The old man who had previously guarded the transmission array was gone, replaced by an early-stage immortal king. As soon as Luo Tian appeared, the old man noticed him.

"Respected elder, please allow me to go to the upper heavens!" Luo Tian spoke, sending his identity token to the old man's front. It wasn't from the Heavenly Yuan Sect but from Star River Prefecture, as Luo Tian was worried about causing trouble with the Heavenly Yuan Sect's token.

"Okay, go!" The old man checked the token and, finding no issues, activated the transmission array.

With his prayers, Luo Tian's figure appeared in Jiutian City, letting him sigh deeply.

Jiutian City was bustling. Figures wearing the nine immortal mountains' attire walked around, with thick immortal energy floating in the sky.

Luo Tian headed toward Jiutian City's outskirts, but his ears caught people's discussions.

"Did you hear? This black market opening has a lot of good things! I heard a mysterious person brought out a Guigu Token!" As he walked, Luo Tian noticed people discussing a place called the black market. The most intriguing thing was the presence of a Guigu Token.

Luo Tian found a restaurant, ordered a table full of dishes, and sent out his spiritual sense to search for useful information.

Chapter 2419: Sun-Moon Stone

Eight hundred miles away from Jiutian City, the Wolf Mountain.

A massive mountain body stood like a howling giant wolf, looking formidable. The entire mountain had no trees, only rocks.

Night fell, and figures appeared on the Wolf Mountain. All were masked, each finding a corner to stand or sit.

As night deepened, the Wolf Mountain gradually became lively but with a heavy atmosphere.

The black market was known only to those who had lived in Jiutian City for years. People coming here were very confident in their strength, as the black market had no management and relied entirely on self-discipline. The items here were of unclear origin, some even dirty objects—once held, they could cause many troubles. Despite this, many still came because there were many good items to exchange.

Black robes, black demonic energy covering their faces, cold atmosphere spreading—this was Luo Tian, who had come after hearing the news.

The entire Wolf Mountain was filled with people masked to hide their faces. Some started showing their items.

Luo Tian watched the vendors' items, his heart admiring; these black market items were far superior to regular markets, almost all top-tier. The vendors' auras were also formidable; they didn't rush but waited patiently for someone to notice their items.

"Ah, that snow lotus—should be two thousand years old. Kid, don't you buy it for me? And that true essence stone—I feel pretty good!" Bu Tian Stone's voice chattered in Luo Tian's mind.

"Buy!" Luo Tian didn't hesitate, spending money like water to buy extensively. After all, he needed Bu Tian Stone's help; if he didn't feed this guy, he might not give his full effort.

Time flowed smoothly. Luo Tian's purchasing attracted attention; many eyes glowed with greed, but his formidable aura made most give up.

From the wolf's tail to its head, the better items were higher up. Luo Tian walked slower as he went upward. The more he went back, the fewer items were sold with immortal crystals or stones; many required exchanges. The vendors' strength increased as well.

"Kid, there's something good over there!" As Luo Tian approached the wolf's head, Bu Tian Stone's voice echoed in his mind, making Luo Tian's eyes flicker.

Bu Tian Stone had looted many treasure vaults and even the Wheel Turning Sect's vault, so he was particularly sensitive to treasures.

Luo Tian stepped toward the vendor Bu Tian Stone indicated, observing the items on display.

A bronze ancient sword, a broken jar, and a large block of black stone with a green plant growing on it, emitting waves of immortal energy.

"Is this the Sun-Moon Grass?" Luo Tian frowned, recognizing the name of this herb.

Sun-Moon Grass was a five-star immortal grass, absorbing solar energy during the day and lunar energy at night. It grew one inch every hundred years. This Sun-Moon Grass had grown to ten feet high.

"Impossible!" His heart was surprised; he knew Sun-Moon Grass could only grow seven inches, withering after seven hundred years.

This Sun-Moon Grass had exceeded the normal limit of Sun-Moon Grass, leaving Luo Tian puzzled.

"This is definitely common Sun-Moon Grass!" Luo Tian gently moved the leaves, as he was an elixir master and knew immortal herbs well.

"Boss, how much for this Sun-Moon Grass?" Luo Tian asked the vendor, gazing at him.

The vendor was thin, his face hidden by a black veil. He sat there.

"Five large-sized immortal crystals!" The cold voice echoed, devoid of any emotion.

"That's too expensive! Just a Sun-Moon Grass. Three thousand immortal energy stones would be the limit. I'll give you one immortal crystal!" Luo Tian frowned, though he had some assets, he followed the principle of saving where possible.

"Deal..." Unexpectedly, the old man nodded immediately. Luo Tian felt uncomfortable.

"This...," Luo Tian had prepared to haggle, but the vendor agreed immediately, making him feel like he'd been tricked.

"Okay!" Luo Tian sighed, waving his hand to send a large-sized immortal crystal to the vendor's front.

"Sir is very straightforward!" The vendor took the crystal, grabbed the Sun-Moon Grass and handed it to Luo Tian.

"Hey, can you give me that stone too?" Luo Tian smiled, pointing at the unassuming black stone.

Luo Tian knew Bu Tian Stone wanted that stone. This Sun-Moon Grass growing like this might have some connection with the stone.

"Are you wanting that stone?" The vendor pointed at the stone, voice filled with confusion.

"Yes!" Luo Tian nodded. He thought this stone was sold together with the Sun-Moon Grass.

"That's not possible!" The vendor shook his head immediately, waved his hand, and planted another Sun-Moon Grass on the stone. It was still ten feet high.

"I only sell Sun-Moon Grass; I won't give you this stone!" The vendor spoke, voice filled with disdain.

"Ugh! I was tricked!" Luo Tian instantly understood; this stone was a decoy to attract people to buy the Sun-Moon Grass.

"Good job! I didn't expect him to agree so easily." Luo Tian sighed inwardly, realizing he had been tricked. This Sun-Moon Grass was rare but definitely not worth one immortal crystal. He felt a bit embarrassed for giving one.

"This loss I'll take!" Luo Tian spoke, voice filled with anger. He waved his sleeve and left the vendor's stall.

"Ha ha! Another fool, I wonder how many people will be tricked today!" A hoarse voice echoed, filled with excitement. But the surrounding people seemed not to hear.

The vendor didn't notice that as Luo Tian waved his sleeve, a red spark-like dust fell from his sleeve and landed on the unassuming black stone.

Luo Tian stopped at the next stall, pretending to look at a bottle of elixir while secretly laughing.

"Even I didn't get tricked by Sun Konian, let alone you!" Luo Tian thought to himself, communicating with Bu Tian Stone.

"Good item! I found a treasure!" Bu Tian Stone communicated with Luo Tian, his voice filled with excitement.

"It's pure solar and lunar essence! It's the Sun-Moon Stone!" Bu Tian Stone transmitted, making Luo Tian also excited.

The Sun-Moon Stone—Luo Tian had heard of it. It was a miraculous stone, formed only at the intersection of solar and lunar energy. Accumulating to form a fingernail-sized piece took a long time. This large Sun-Moon Stone was definitely priceless!

"Kid, after absorbing this thing, I might be able to kill an immortal king in the middle stage!" Bu Tian Stone spoke, voice filled with excitement.

"This large piece is rare in the world. That's why this Sun-Moon Grass grew so long!" Luo Tian thought to himself.

At that moment, another person approached the vendor's stall, eyeing the Sun-Moon Grass.
