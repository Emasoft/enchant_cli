Chapter 2649: Spring of the Well

"Are we going to die?" Everyone's hearts trembled as they gazed at the fissured domain, their eyes turning to Luo Tian, who remained calm, placing their hopes in him.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows; indeed, the situation was thorny. The sheer number of entities was overwhelming—should they appear in Hell, chaos would ensue.

Yet these were merely ghostly qi. Perhaps within this passage, there existed a unique method for their emergence.

"This technique is astonishing; if mastered, one could repel an entire sect!" Luo Tian murmured lowly. Yet he still regarded them with indifference, continuing to control the domain as it surged downward.

As Luo Tian's domain gradually mended, those following him wiped the cold sweat from their brows.

"Master of the Holy Sect is mighty! Even a domain could repel countless True Immortals at their peak!" They praised Luo Tian incessantly, hoping he would not abandon them.

Roar...

As the crowd fawned over him, a guttural roar echoed. A solid black figure charged forth, transforming into a streak of obsidian light that lunged toward Luo Tian's domain.

"An Immortal King's aura!" The people within the domain gasped, for an entity of such caliber could shatter Luo Tian's domain.

"Merely a single strike from an Immortal King!" Luo Tian shook his head lightly, having understood the nature of these entities after enduring so long.

These ghostly qi-formed beings seemed formidable, yet they were but a single display of power—like the previous True Immortals at their peak, who had attacked Luo Tian once and then dissolved into ghostly qi.

A faint smile graced Luo Tian's face as he stepped out of the domain, thrusting his spear toward the approaching aura.

Boom...

The black figure was instantly obliterated by Luo Tian's spear, transforming into a surging tide of ghostly qi that surged outward.

Luo Tian returned to the domain, then extended his hand, creating a fissure on its surface. A powerful suction emerged, drawing the dense ghostly qi into the domain.

Luo Tian's hands moved swiftly, activating his Mind Demon Palace to begin absorbing the surging ghostly qi. The density of this qi was overwhelming.

Luo Tian opened his mouth, inhaling the thick ghostly qi into his body, beginning to refine it into pure demonic energy that flowed into his elixir field.

"Even a fly's leg is meat!" Luo Tian mused internally; after all, this was faster than his usual cultivation.

"If I could absorb this, my strength would surely soar!" The people's faces bore envy as they gazed at Luo Tian.

"What place is this? We've already encountered two Immortal Kings—this one and the Cyclops!" Luo Tian's mind darkened; he had entered many tombs before, knowing that the closer one approached the coffin of the tomb's master, the more terrifying the encounters. He had only just begun and had already faced an Immortal King at its initial stage—what awaited deeper within?

"Let me hope there's something here to elevate my strength!" Luo Tian's lips curled, and he led the group deeper.

After another half-hour of descent, the black ghostly qi gradually dissipated, allowing those within Luo Tian's domain to exhale long sighs of relief.

Boom...

Yet before they reached the bottom, a series of thunderous roars erupted from beneath their feet. A violent fluctuation sent tremors through their souls.

"Someone is fighting!" They gasped, sensing that survival was improbable under such fluctuations.

"You all stay here; absorb the ghostly qi. A day here equals a year outside!" Luo Tian addressed them, his hands emitting waves that solidified the domain, leaving an opening just wide enough for one to pass through. Dense ghostly qi surged in through the aperture.

Luo Tian then ascended, heading downward—this was his utmost effort.

In an instant, he broke through the ghostly qi, revealing a vast hall before his eyes, exuding an eerie atmosphere.

At the center of the hall stood a pool, roughly a thousand zhang in diameter, its waters dark and seemingly on the verge of drying up.

"What is this?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, standing within the hall.

Within the hall, several figures clashed repeatedly, their clash of heavenly forces echoing. Upon Luo Tian's arrival, their expressions shifted slightly.

"Luo Brother!" Yin Wu's eyes lit with joy as he retreated, gazing at Luo Tian from a corner of the hall.

"Everyone's here?" A faint smile graced Luo Tian's face as he landed beside Yin Wu, his gaze sweeping over the others in the hall.

The old man with skin like withered bark, Luo Li, and the refined middle-aged man along with his four attendants were all present.

"Why are you fighting?" Luo Tian inquired, noting that none of them were easily manageable. Before his arrival, Yin Wu and Luo Li had clashed, while the withered-bark old man and the refined middle-aged man also fought. The four attendants stood in a strange formation at the hall's corner, seemingly arranged in a formation.

"Look at that pool!" Yin Wu pointed toward the black pool, its center bubbling with dark water, shrouded in swirling black mist.

"This is World Force!" Luo Tian's heart jolted; after a careful感应, he detected a fluctuation from the spring's location—exceeding heavenly force. What else could it be but World Force?

"Indeed, this might be the World Heart. Perhaps it dates back to ancient times; do you know what that signifies?" Yin Wu's eyes gleamed with excitement as he addressed Luo Tian.

"It could have evolved into a World Treasure, and after such an extended period, it might surpass ordinary World Treasures!" Luo Tian understood, his eyes narrowing slightly.

"Buzz..." As the two exchanged brief words, a fluctuation emanated from the direction of the refined middle-aged man.

"Apologies, everyone—this World Treasure belongs to me!" The middle-aged man smiled softly, his fan expanding dramatically. He stepped onto the fan and lunged toward the black spring.

"Die!" As the man surged forward, Luo Li and the withered-bark old man's eyes flashed with killing intent. They ascended, their bodies radiating formidable energy as they pursued the man.

But before they could move, a fragrant breeze arose; the four attendants of the middle-aged man lightly tapped their fingers. Four-colored divine light converged above everyone's heads, enveloping the entire hall with a formidable aura.

Chapter 2650: The Four Seasons Formation

The four-colored divine light surged skyward, enveloping Luo Tian's group. It blocked Luo Li and the withered-bark old man's advance.

"The Four Seasons Formation! He is Master Chen Qingxuan of the Four Seasons!" The withered-bark old man gasped, and Luo Li's expression shifted.

"He's still alive, and his physical condition is astonishingly strong!" They clearly recognized Chen Qingxuan and understood his might.

As they marveled, the formation activated, with the four attendants taking positions at each corner. They continuously emitted waves, attacking Luo Tian and his group.

Boom...

A storm surged as the green-robed attendant unleashed it, sweeping toward Luo Tian.

"Four seasons, alternating?" Luo Tian murmured lowly, raising his hands to unleash a storm of spear shadows, clashing with the incoming attack.

Yin Wu and Luo Li also launched their attacks, but this formation surpassed their expectations significantly.

"Damned! The Four Seasons Formation can reinforce each other's cycles, making it endless!" Luo Li's face darkened as he blocked a barrage of ice blades. Yet after shattering, the blades vanished, transforming into a storm that swept toward Luo Tian.

This formation was driven by the four attendants, so its power wasn't overwhelming. However, it was sufficient to trap Luo Tian's group for a while; breaking through would demand effort.

As time passed, the formation's power gradually intensified, deepening their apprehension. They knew they couldn't delay further.

"Back in those days, Master Chen Qingxuan used this formation to annihilate an entire city. It was that battle that truly spread his name!" The withered-bark old man continuously fought, watching Chen Qingxuan standing at the center of the black pool.

Chen Qingxuan's eyes gleamed with excitement. In their era, the World Heart might have been within his grasp—but it was never meant for him.

"Indeed, one must live long to obtain what they desire!" Chen Qingxuan chuckled softly. Though his strength had diminished from its peak, this era was no longer his. He wasn't the strongest, but none could match him.

"The World Heart—now that I possess it, my life can be prolonged for a long time!" Chen Qingxuan murmured, then dove toward the spring.

Gurgling...

The black waves surged as Chen Qingxuan raised a massive tide, vanishing from Luo Tian's group's sight.

Luo Li and the withered-bark old man's faces darkened to an extreme; for the World Heart, they were determined. Compared to Luo Tian and Yin Wu, they needed it more—its power could extend their lives.

"Four girls, I'll finish you off once I emerge!" Luo Li roared, finally anxious as Chen Qingxuan entered. His body radiated another burst of power, his right arm swelling with explosive force, charging toward the four-colored divine light-encased barrier.

The heavens roared as scales sprouted along his massive arm, each emitting a cold glow and a low roar.

"Old monster, aren't you using your full strength yet?" Luo Li roared, clearly recognizing the withered-bark old man. His fist shattered space, striking the four-colored barrier.

Crack...

The sound of cracking echoed as Luo Li's full-force strike left cracks in the barrier. The four attendants spat blood.

The old man known as "old monster" exhaled a streak of light, striking the four-colored barrier.

Plop... Plop...

Blood spewed from the attendants' mouths again, yet the barrier still stood—though on the verge of collapse.

A black dragon surged forth as Luo Tian pierced space with his spear, striking the barrier he had previously cracked.

Finally, the terrifying attacks from the four ceased; the four-colored barrier exploded with a thunderous roar, shattering before Luo Tian's group, swirling into a tempest of chaotic seasons.

"Go!" Luo Tian stepped with the Yellow River Step, his body darting toward the spring.

They didn't stop Luo Li or the old monster; they knew their priority was to retrieve Chen Qingxuan first. If the World Treasure fell into his hands, they would never seize it.

Plunge...

Luo Tian instantly plunged into the spring. As he entered, his heart grew heavy.

His mission was to investigate Luo Shengmen and assist Yin Wu in obtaining the World Heart, succeeding would let Yin Wu become the Grand Master of Wuhua Hall.

In an instant, darkness enveloped him; everywhere was black water, unnaturally cold—even Luo Tian's cultivation felt piercingly icy.

As he leapt into the water, Yin Wu, Luo Li, and the old monster also followed.

The water seemed endless; though the pool appeared small, it felt bottomless. The four swam downward.

Time passed slowly; eventually, they reached the pool's bottom, where a black hall stood before them.

Water gushed from this hall's top, which bore a black crystal radiating an eerie aura.

"What is this?" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly; upon entering the spring, he felt his chest heat up. That fluctuation came from something—Huanmo Stone!

The black crystal at the hall's top was also a Huanmo Stone, a rare heavenly stone. Luo Tian didn't know what it recorded.

Luo Tian halted his movement, gazing at the black hall. He hadn't found the World Heart but had discovered a Huanmo Stone.

"Huanmo Soldiers!" Luo Tian suddenly recalled what those ghostly qi-formed entities were—though they weren't complete Huanmo Soldiers, they must have been self-evolved from the Huanmo Stone.

Yin Wu, Luo Li, and the old monster also halted their movement, gazing at the black hall with apprehension.

"This hall is no ordinary place!" Luo Li spoke, gazing at the hovering black crystal above.

"This hall is a World Treasure!"

"But that crystal seems fused with the World Treasure!" The old monster spoke, his eyes filled with caution.

"Where is Chen Qingxuan?" They scanned the surroundings but found no trace of him.

"The World Treasure and Huanmo Stone are fused?" Luo Tian's lips twitched; his mind grew even more apprehensive. He knew the terror of Huanmo Stone—what changes could occur if it merged with a World Treasure?

Chapter 2651: The Huanmo Hall

Powerful fluctuations continuously emanated from the black hall. Even pressure alone made Luo Tian and his group—Immortal Kings at their middle stage—feel extremely uncomfortable.

"Even an Immortal King at its peak would struggle to subdue this hall!" Luo Li spoke again, gazing at the black hall.

"Regretfully, we are no longer at our peaks!" The old monster sighed; they had once dominated their regions, renowned in their time. Now, they were on the brink of death, endlessly seeking means to prolong life.

Buzz...

Fluctuations continued as they spoke. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the black hall—dressed in black qi, gaunt-faced, holding a fan.

"It's Chen Qingxuan!" Everyone gasped, watching the figure shrouded in black qi, his state clearly abnormal.

His eyes were veiled by dark mist, devoid of previous refinement; he radiated an icy aura.

"He's been controlled!"

"How long has it taken for him to break?" The old monster's face shifted, taking a step back.

They were of an age where their minds were exceptionally resolute; few could manipulate them or trap them in illusions.

"Let's go, this isn't our fight!" Luo Tian addressed Yin Wu, deciding not to involve himself.

"Master..." Yin Wu's face darkened; he hadn't expected Luo Tian to back out so soon.

"Yin Brother, I advise you not to attempt to seize it; otherwise, you'll face eternal ruin!" Luo Tian spoke to Yin Wu.

"It's too late!" As Luo Tian's words fell, ten waves of demonic light surged from the black hall. A cold voice echoed through the black water into Luo Tian's ears.

Figures emerged from the demonic hall, all in states similar to Chen Qingxuan's.

Ten people total—each at the initial stage of Immortal King, radiating formidable power. They immediately surrounded Luo Tian's group.

"Liu Tianzun, Zhang Tianzun!" Yin Wu gasped, gazing at two elders—his Wuhua Hall's two Tianzuns.

"Who is speaking?" Luo Li and the old monster shouted, scanning their surroundings.

As they spoke, a figure silently appeared atop the black hall, standing with hands behind his back. Dressed in black robes, he smiled, gazing toward Luo Tian's group.

"Long time no see; I didn't expect you to have aged so much!" The black-robed figure spoke, his misty veil lifting.

Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly; his expression grew more solemn, whispering a name—one he would remember for life.

"Yang Huanyu!" Luo Tian's cautious voice echoed, his mind also startled; he hadn't expected to meet Yang Huanyu here.

"Did you establish Luo Shengmen?" Luo Tian asked, locking eyes with Yang Huanyu.

"Yes!"

"I didn't expect you to come here; it surprises me." Yang Huanyu's face bore a sigh, standing atop the black hall without regard for Yin Wu's group.

Years had passed; Yang Huanyu's aura was even stronger now. Luo Tian couldn't perceive it, only sensing a formidable crisis.

"How did he achieve this?" Luo Tian's mind puzzled; Luo Shengmen was too powerful. Yang Huanyu wasn't one to submit, a fact Luo Tian had known since his time in the Tianyuan Continent.

Yet Luo Shengmen was so strong, and Yang Huanyu had developed it to such an extent in a short time—Yang Huanyu was truly extraordinary.

None of these people were ones to submit; for instance, Jing Wuye who had possessed Jiang Chen. How could they obey Yang Huanyu?

Luo Tian didn't doubt Yang Huanyu's abilities, but Yang Huanyu had exceeded Luo Tian's comprehension.

"Master Luo, our long-standing relationship—do you have any interest in joining us? I believe we could be unstoppable, and within a century, the entire immortal realm and hell would belong to us!"

"Longevity—this is not impossible for us!" Yang Huanyu gazed at Luo Tian, speaking.

Hearing Yang Huanyu's words, Luo Tian sighed internally; he most disliked being an enemy of Yang Huanyu. They had fought for years, and when Yang Huanyu died, Luo Tian had felt a pang of sorrow.

"Regretfully, our paths diverge; we cannot align," Luo Tian replied, his spear emitting a resonant hum. A formidable battle spirit surged from him.

Luo Tian was indeed stimulated by Yang Huanyu; for years, he had believed himself to have grown swiftly, but Yang Huanyu's progress was even swifter.

For Yang Huanyu, Luo Tian had always felt a sense of mutual admiration; such a powerful opponent was also one of his motivations.

Luo Tian had too many attachments behind him to ally with Yang Huanyu; this was incompatible with his path.

Yang Huanyu had spilled blood, resorting to any means for his goal—longevity. To achieve this, he had sacrificed countless lives.

Initially, Yang Huanyu had succeeded; however, it was all a scheme of the Yin Domain. Yang Huanyu had become another's pawn.

With the lesson from the Tianyuan Continent, Yang Huanyu would surely not repeat that mistake. Luo Tian had met Yang Huanyu several times before; he always sensed a secret within Yang Huanyu, leading him to this point.

"Some truth!"

"Without you, it's not interesting, but I will surely win this time. Then I'll spare your life as well!" Yang Huanyu smiled lightly, standing atop the black hall.

"Old men, do you want eternal life?" Yang Huanyu stood atop the hall, like a master of this sky, gazing at Luo Li and the old monster.

"Kid, when we ruled the skies, you were still nowhere to be found. To have us submit—do you even deserve it?" The old monster spoke coldly, holding a wooden staff. His eyes flashed with divine light; he knew this kid might be the hall's master.

If they killed Yang Huanyu, perhaps this hall could change hands. Moreover, they might not even escape now.

"Let's form an alliance; we might have a chance to fight!" Luo Tian spoke, transmitting thoughts to Luo Li and the old monster.

"Good!" Luo Li and the old monster didn't hesitate; they also sensed Yang Huanyu's complexity. After all, only someone who could master this Huanmo Hall could be so formidable.

"Interesting!" Yang Huanyu's face remained calm, one eye shifting into a crescent moon, radiating cold light.

Chapter 2652: Death

As Yang Huanyu's two eyes merged, the ten Immortal King figures let out a guttural roar and lunged toward Luo Tian's group.

"Kill them, or we won't escape!" The old monster growled; these ten figures were only slightly棘手 compared to Chen Qingxuan, but the others weren't too concerning.

Luo Tian also ascended, confronting three Immortal Kings at their initial stage. His black spear danced, sweeping across the three.

Boom...

Instantly, his spear swept across one of the Immortal Kings, sending him flying. Luo Tian's other hand formed a seal, summoning the Hellish Demon Claw to attack the remaining two.

The old monster faced Chen Qingxuan, while Luo Li and Yin Wu each confronted three others. All four were at the middle stage of Immortal King, top-tier within their rank—thus, they weren't intimidated by these initial-stage Immortal Kings. Only the old monster's fight with Chen Qingxuan was fierce and intense.

Yet, they didn't relax; Yang Huanyu still stood there, and the Huanmo Hall radiated waves of divine light. Yang Huanyu was the most formidable threat.

Yang Huanyu didn't move, appearing as an outsider watching Luo Tian's group fight relentlessly.

"Something's off!" As Luo Tian fought three initial-stage Immortal Kings, he also observed Yang Huanyu.

Who in this world knew Yang Huanyu best? Besides himself, Luo Tian was certainly one of them.

"He knows we'll win but doesn't act—this isn't his nature. Without absolute confidence, he wouldn't have appeared here!" Luo Tian mused internally.

Suddenly, Luo Tian glanced toward Yang Huanyu's direction and saw the divine light in his eyes—especially that crescent moon eye. His heart jolted.

"Don't use your martial arts; he's learning our techniques, seeking our weaknesses!" Luo Tian roared, guessing Yang Huanyu's intent.

The crescent moon eye was undeniably terrifying; Luo Tian had experienced it firsthand, so he guessed Yang Huanyu was observing them.

"You got part of it; think again!" Yang Huanyu smiled, gazing at Luo Tian. No one knew what he was thinking.

"Part of it?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, striking back one initial-stage Immortal King.

"Could it be?" Luo Tian suddenly awoke, his eyes flashing golden light toward Yang Huanyu's direction.

"He hasn't fully subdued the Huanmo Hall yet; he can only control part of it. He's stalling for time!" The old monster's forehead split open, revealing a green eye gazing at Yang Huanyu. He shouted to Luo Tian's group.

"One minute—within one minute, we must finish these; otherwise, when he activates the hall, we'll all be subdued!" The old monster continued.

"Ten Thousand Blue Skies!" As the old monster roared, he ascended, his hands moving swiftly. A blue sky manifested, crushing toward Chen Qingxuan.

A formidable pressure surged; the blue sky roiled with overwhelming energy, crushing down upon Yang Huanyu, who displayed interest.

"Powerful!" Luo Tian's heart tightened; watching the crushing blue sky, he felt even if he faced it, he wouldn't have a good outcome.

"Die!" On the other side, Luo Li roared, his fists covered in scales, colliding to unleash gray lightning that struck the three initial-stage Immortal Kings.

"None of them are easy!" Luo Tian sighed internally; the techniques Luo Li and the old monster used were exceptionally strong. He was certain that even with his crescent moon eye, he couldn't learn them in one go.

Luo Tian raised his hand, piercing space with a spear strike—Breaking Void Spear—and attacked the three initial-stage Immortal Kings.

"Pu pu..."

The black spear precisely pierced the hearts of two initial-stage Immortal Kings, tearing through their bodies with a ripping sound.

"This kid isn't simple!" The old monster and Luo Li's eyes flickered slightly, witnessing Luo Tian's spear technique.

A single strike eliminated two initial-stage Immortal Kings; Luo Tian had mastered the timing perfectly, striking when their positions overlapped.

Boom...

At the same time, Luo Tian extended his hand, using his unparalleled physical strength to withstand the remaining initial-stage Immortal King's attack.

"Die too!" Luo Tian roared, his fingers carving cracks that collided with the Immortal King's fist.

Blood mist surged; this initial-stage Immortal King was instantly turned into blood mist, floating before Luo Tian.

Among the four, only Yin Wu struggled slightly but still eliminated three initial-stage Immortal Kings.

Blood mist surged; nine initial-stage Immortal Kings were obliterated within moments, showcasing terrifying combat power.

Only the old monster's fight with Chen Qingxuan remained intense; wind and storms clashed, as Chen Qingxuan's fan danced, weaving four storms that collided with the old monster's blue sky.

"Stalemate! Chen Qingxuan wasn't supposed to be controlled, yet he fights with such strength—almost as if uncontrolled!" Yin Wu spoke in confusion, wiping blood from his lips.

"Old monster,辛苦了! I'll finish that kid first and help you!" Luo Li's eyes gleamed with determination, ascending toward Yang Huanyu.

This was an opportunity; defeating Yang Huanyu would allow him to possibly take his place, mastering part of the Huanmo Hall. Luo Li was confident that if he could master it, he wouldn't fear Luo Tian and the old monster's competition.

"Go..." Yin Wu was also anxious, ascending toward the Huanmo Hall but was pulled back by Luo Tian.

"Idiot! Come back!" Luo Tian roared, watching Luo Li rush forward. He knew Yang Huanyu was no easy opponent; rushing like that would surely result in a loss.

Brief alliance—Luo Li was their side's powerful force; Luo Tian himself couldn't match Yang Huanyu.

"Think about how Chen Qingxuan was controlled!" Luo Tian addressed Yin Wu, but Luo Li had already reached a hundred zhang away from the Huanmo Hall. A hundred zhang for them was like being at arm's length.

"Die!" Before reaching Yang Huanyu, Luo Li began to gather power, aiming for a single decisive strike to eliminate Yang Huanyu and replace him.

"Living this long, yet still so naive!" Yang Huanyu stood atop the hall, gazing at Luo Li's punch without moving. Yet the Huanmo Hall beneath him radiated dark light.

In an instant, a moon of demonic light hovered above Yang Huanyu's head. The demon light shone into Luo Li's eyes, causing his body to suddenly tremble as if bound by something. He stood motionless.

"An illusion!" Luo Tian's face turned ashen, gazing at the demon moon above Yang Huanyu. His mind was heavy; combining Huanmo Stone with a crescent moon eye had maximized the environment's potential. Even Luo Li, a strong warrior, had fallen for it.

Chapter 2653: The Yellow River Tomb

Outside the Huanmo Hall, a ten-thousand-zhang radius had become a forbidden zone. Luo Li stood there, his eyes gradually turning hazy, losing consciousness.

"Roar..." In an instant, Luo Li let out a fierce roar, his body continuously striking the air as if engaged in a grueling battle.

"His vitality is decreasing!" Yin Wu's face darkened, yet he also felt relieved; if not for Luo Tian pulling him back, he would have fallen victim too.

One punch... ten punches...

A series of fierce punches appeared before Luo Tian, each causing space to tremble.

"A formidable combat power!" Luo Tian mused internally; this was Luo Li's true strength, yet it was wasted now.

"First, help the old monster defeat Chen Qingxuan!" Luo Tian spoke, his black spear transforming into a black dragon as it lunged toward Chen Qingxuan.

Yin Wu's body also radiated waves, his hands rapidly changing to form a Xuanwu Seal, crushing toward Chen Qingxuan.

Their attacks were fierce; Chen Qingxuan finally stopped attacking the old monster, choosing defense instead. Four-colored storms surrounded him.

The thunderous sound echoed throughout the hall as the blue sky pressed down, the black dragon roared, and the seal crushed. Luo Tian's three attacks collided with the four-colored storms.

The collision shattered the four-colored storms, and Chen Qingxuan's body was violently thrown back, spitting blood. His body emitted a crackling sound, looking utterly defeated.

The old monster exhaled, emitting an invisible wave from his mouth, which landed on Chen Qingxuan.

Chen Qingxuan's vitality was absorbed into the old monster, and he instantly aged, becoming a skeletal figure before vanishing.

"Monstrous!" Luo Tian and Yin Wu muttered internally, their gazes toward the old monster changing; they became wary.

On the other side, Luo Li's body fell from the sky, convulsing before finally dying of exhaustion.

"Tragic indeed!" The old monster licked his lips, gazing at Luo Li with a gleam in his eyes.

"This is clearly wasted effort!" Luo Tian and Yin Wu sighed internally, stepping back from the old monster.

"What now?" The old monster gazed at Yang Huanyu atop the demonic hall, addressing Luo Tian and Yin Wu.

"He controls a ten-thousand-zhang radius of illusion; once entered, one is ensnared. If there's no way to break it, we can't do anything!" Luo Tian spoke, sensing the old monster had hidden skills.

From the start, Luo Tian felt this old monster was more formidable than Chen Qingxuan and Luo Li. Indeed, now that the others were dead, only the old monster remained alive.

"Master, you've seen much; surely you have a solution!" Luo Tian smiled lightly, gazing at the old monster.

"Kid, you still have secrets!" The old monster knew what he was—having lived too long, his mind was as cunning as a demon. He understood Luo Tian's thoughts.

"Retreat, I give up!" The old monster glanced at Yang Huanyu, then shook his head. He ascended, flying toward the entrance.

"Uh..." Seeing the old monster leave, Yin Wu was momentarily stunned; he hadn't expected the old monster to back down.

But after thinking, Yin Wu understood: they had lost three people; those who lived to this age feared death most.

"Shall we retreat?" Yin Wu's eyes bore reluctance; it was a World Treasure after all—who wouldn't be tempted?

"This tomb's name?" Luo Tian gazed at Yang Huanyu, asking. His eyes still held a smile.

"Yellow River Tomb!" Yang Huanyu answered directly, locking eyes with Luo Tian. The two's battle spirit gradually rose.

Hearing Yang Huanyu's words, Yin Wu's face shifted in shock.

The Yellow River—flowing through Hell—but Yin Wu, as a Holy Son of the Ten Palaces, knew that "Yellow River" was also a name. That person was an ancient powerhouse from the era of the Ten Palace Kings and Eight Heavenly Kings, who controlled the entire Yellow River.

Some said the Yellow River was an offspring of the true Yellow River; others claimed it was merely a common person who had climbed to become a great power through self-cultivation.

"Yellow River?" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly; he suddenly recalled the person who had sent him two messages before. Each time, they left behind a scent of Yellow River water.

"Yellow River!" But then Luo Tian also gasped, recalling a person—more accurately, a ghostly entity.

"Could it be..." Luo Tian muttered internally, his face showing a bitter smile. If it was truly who he thought, then this tomb would require him to enter at least once.

"But why hasn't he shown himself?" Luo Tian's mind was filled with doubts, gazing at Yang Huanyu.

"Master Luo, shall we go?" Yin Wu spoke, interrupting Luo Tian's thoughts and bringing him back to reality.

Yin Wu wanted to leave; the two Immortal Kings from Wuhua Hall were already dead, and they couldn't obtain the World Heart. More importantly, Yin Wu knew this was whose tomb.

The Yellow River Tomb's emergence was a major event; Yin Wu must return to Wuhua Hall, delivering the news. This matter had exceeded his control; it required the Grand Master of Wuhua Hall to come personally.

"Did you summon me?" Luo Tian asked again, ignoring Yin Wu and still gazing at Yang Huanyu.

"Of course not; do you think I summoned you?" Yang Huanyu's eyes finally showed confusion, as Luo Tian understood Yang Huanyu, and Yang Huanyu also understood Luo Tian.

"I see!" Luo Tian replied, his spear "Rip the Heavens" in hand. He took a step toward Yang Huanyu's direction.

Yin Wu was left speechless by their words, unsure of what they meant. Yet seeing Luo Tian walking toward Yang Huanyu's direction, Yin Wu became anxious.

Yin Wu knew Luo Tian's relationship with the Wheel Turning Sect; if Luo Tian had any trouble, it would inevitably strain relations between the Wheel Turning Sect and Wuhua Hall.

"Luo Brother, let's return; have Wuhua Hall's Grand Master come. This is too dangerous for you!" Yin Wu roared, but Luo Tian seemed to have not heard.
