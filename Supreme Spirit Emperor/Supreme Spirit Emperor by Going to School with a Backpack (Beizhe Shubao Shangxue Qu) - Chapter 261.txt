The Tianyuan Continent, within the Five Elements Sect, Luo Tian's eyes carefully observed the four statues before him, his expression revealing a flicker of disbelief.

"Dare you! Who are you to dare enter the sacred grounds of the Five Elements Sect!" Just as Luo Tian marveled, a chorus of stern voices echoed around him. Several elders at the peak of transcendence materialized before Luo Tian, surrounding him with expressions of intense suspicion.

Luo Tian's thoughts were interrupted. His brows furrowed slightly, for he had clearly sensed a subtle fluctuation within the statues—though faint, it was unmistakably captured by his perception.

"Alas..." The disturbance disrupted his focus. He could no longer sense the faint vitality.

"Answer us, or we shall resort to force!" The elders' faces bore murderous intent as they barked at Luo Tian, drawing their weapons. Any sudden movement from him would result in an instant deathblow.

"Respected Elders, it's been a long time!" Luo Tian smiled and turned to bow respectfully toward the elders. These were former sect elders, now possessing formidable power.

At the moment Luo Tian turned, they reacted as if facing an enemy. Yet, he had already altered his appearance.

"Luo Tian!" The elders gasped in surprise upon seeing him, their faces alight with joy.

"I'm back!" Luo Tian spoke softly. Though his voice was quiet, it resonated across the entire Five Elements Sect.

After a surge of excitement, people gathered in the light field, their eyes filled with joy as they gazed at Luo Tian.

"Everyone, I have a significant announcement to make!" Luo Tian addressed the people around him, who were deeply connected to him.

"Luo Tian, we've heard about it. Speak, and we'll follow your orders!"

"Indeed! What's the big deal with the Divine Clan? We can just fight it out!" The sect members shouted, their eyes ablaze with battle spirit.

Luo Tian felt touched. He gently placed Luo Xiting and Luo Li on the ground, then bowed respectfully to the crowd. "Everyone, I'm sorry for what's coming. In a month, it may bring disaster to the Five Elements Sect. I wish for you all to relocate to the Fire Domain."

A trace of shame flickered in Luo Tian's eyes as he spoke, drawing everyone's attention.

Luo Tian had already decided to go alone to the Divine Beast Domain. The Divine Clan's strength was not something numbers could resolve. If they clashed, even countless people would be futile.

"Luo Tian, what are you afraid of? Death is but a single step! Without you, the Five Elements Sect would have already perished. I don't care about others, but we must go!" The sect's leaders shouted loudly.

Luo Tian shook his head with a bitter smile, knowing they would never listen. He spoke again: "Listen to me. This time, numbers won't solve it. I'll return safely—trust me!"

Silence fell. As Luo Tian's words echoed, the entire plaza fell silent. He was right—since the seal on the Tianyuan Continent had opened, people knew how terrifying the Divine Clan was. Even if all sects of the Four Sacred Star Domains gathered, they might still fail to defeat a single Divine Clan member.

"Enough. Don't worry, I have my own means!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with confidence as he took the hands of Gu Qianxue and the three girls, leading the two children toward their residence.

...

The Divine Clan, the foremost clan in the Divine Beast Domain, was already bustling with activity despite having a month until the Divine Clan's princess's wedding. People continuously arrived with smiles, each recipient of the Divine Clan's invitation being a major family or sect. The Divine Clan's invitations symbolized status; without one, you were essentially insignificant in the Nine Domains.

In a lavish courtyard of the Divine Clan, an elderly figure sat with a troubled expression, sighing deeply. Beside him stood a graceful silhouette, her face also etched with sorrow.

"Grandpa, perhaps I should just marry him. You nearly lost your life last time. If you defy the Divine King again, I fear..." Sun Mengru spoke softly, her voice laced with resentment.

"Daughter, I've never had children. You are as dear to me as my own granddaughter. To ensure your happiness, what is a life but a sacrifice? If you don't wish to marry, no one can force you!" Sun Hefeng coughed slightly. As the Grand Elder of the Divine Clan, he was among the most revered figures. Yet now, he appeared like a dying old man, his eyes filled with helplessness.

As the Grand Elder of the Divine Clan, Sun Hefeng had long known about Sun Mengru's marriage. However, he knew she did not love the Divine King's son. Two people from different eras could never be compatible, even in cultivation circles where age was irrelevant. The gap between them was too vast for Sun Hefeng's peace of mind, leading him to angrily confront the Divine King multiple times.

Yet Sun Hefeng, despite being Grand Elder, was still far beneath the Divine King. His first visit ended with him being expelled; the second saw him thrown out, and the third had him carried out. If not for Sun Mengru bringing back a sacred herb, he would have already perished.

Sun Mengru's eyes glimmered with a faint smile as she recalled her two encounters with Luo Tian. She could not deny that she had fallen for him.

"Alas... I regret not going with you in the Divine Beast Ancient Cave. It's too late now. They say you clashed with the Divine King in the Divine Beast Domain. I just hope you won't come!" Sun Mengru sighed silently, knowing how terrifying the Divine Clan was.

"The only hope left is this boy who vowed to disrupt the wedding. He's our last chance!" Sun Hefeng's eyes bore a bitter smile, his aged gaze deepening.

...

Time flowed slowly. Before long, only fifteen days remained until the Divine Clan's wedding.

At dawn, sunlight spilled across the sky as a figure silently leapt from Wuxing Mountain, vanishing into the horizon.

"Trust me—I'll return!" Luo Tian's eyes held a smile as he soared into the sky, heading toward the Fire Domain.

The very next day after Luo Tian left the Five Elements Sect, the entire Tianyuan Continent was abuzz with activity. All sects gathered at the Five Elements Sect, and a command spread: any sect or person connected to Luo Tian was to head for Tongtian Mountain in the Fire Domain.

The entire Four Sacred Star Domains stirred. Anyone with even a slight connection to Luo Tian knew that another major event was about to unfold.

Luo Tian flew for three days, arriving at the Fire Domain. After giving instructions, he reached the Beast Domain.

The Beast Domain's Holy City was familiar to Luo Tian. He accurately located the territory of the Yuxing Ghost Ferret Clan.

At that moment, Gu Lei, Zheng Xin, and Xu Liyi were chatting under a tree. A wretched figure was held by Chen Zhanbiao, while Yan Jun, clad in black combat attire, wore a bitter smile. He continuously tickled the wretched figure's feet with a feather.

"Ha! Xu Liyi, your mother—what have you done to me for days? Your mother's a bastard! You still haven't vented your anger, you bastard! I swear, Zhanbiao, how did you get me here!" Wan Lingkong laughed loudly, cursing Xu Liyi.

"Dammit! Wan Lingkong, you bastard, you sent me to the Dragon-Devouring Valley. That's one of the Nine Perilous Zones! If not for my cleverness, I'd be dead. You still dare to curse me!" Xu Liyi's eyes flashed with disdain.

"Fine, fine. You're the Great Elder. Five million yuan energy stones—how's that!" Wan Lingkong knew Xu Liyi's weakness and, after enduring so long, finally gave in.

"Five million. No more, no less. I'll forget this!" Xu Liyi's eyes lit up, realizing Wan Lingkong had given in. He began haggling.

"Future—maybe it's all on you! Take care of my brothers!" Luo Tian stood outside the Holy City, gazing at Wan Lingkong's group. His eyes held a smile.

Luo Tian had intended to visit the Holy City and greet Bao Yuanshan, hoping for his assistance in a critical moment. However, he hadn't noticed Bao Yuanshan's absence. He guessed that Bao Yuanshan had gone somewhere to ascend into the early era.

"I hope you can make it in time!" Luo Tian whispered, sighing deeply before vanishing into the stars.

Three days passed. Only six days remained until the Divine Clan's set wedding date. During these six days, Luo Tian finally entered the Divine Beast Domain.

Passing through the Demon Clan's territory, he found no sign of Nan Gong Yuqing or Elder Nan Gong Bo. He knew they had arrived at the Divine Clan ahead of time.

"Being alone is quite nice!" Luo Tian smiled, his heart lighter. After flying for two days, he reached the Divine Beast Ancient Cave's entrance. His gaze fell on the cave, still radiating fierce energy, and a trace of guilt flickered in his eyes. "Jiang Xiong, I'm sorry!"

After bowing to the Divine Beast Ancient Cave, Luo Tian vanished from the spot, heading toward the Divine Clan.

"Boom...!" As Luo Tian disappeared outside the cave, a surge of energy echoed from within. Black and white qi churned ceaselessly.

Chapter 1,111: Delivering Invitations

In the Divine Beast Domain's Divine Clan, only one day remained until the wedding of the Divine Prince and Divine Princess. The vast Divine Mountain was illuminated with lights, as most attendees wore smiles, joyfully celebrating this grand event.

Luo Tian stood among the crowd, barely noticeable. The sheer number of people made it difficult to enter the Divine Clan; one had to queue for a long time and possess an invitation.

"Brother, are you here to witness the Divine Clan's wedding? I heard the Divine Princess is as beautiful as a celestial being, and the Divine Prince Sun Feiwen is equally handsome. They're truly a match made in heaven!" A young man, filled with envy, addressed Luo Tian.

"Indeed! I heard the renowned genius of the Nine Domains, Luo Tian, wants to cause trouble for the Divine Clan. I wonder if he dares to come. Look, all major sects of the Divine Beast Domain have arrived. The domain masters from other regions came days ago and were invited into the Divine Mountain. I think Luo Tian is too scared to come, after all, it's a death trap!" Another young man sighed, expressing his thoughts.

Luo Tian listened to the murmurs among the crowd. His gaze fell on the long line outside the Divine Clan's gates.

"Alas... we can only watch from outside and cannot enter the Divine Clan." Two young men expressed regret, as they were ordinary cultivators from the Divine Beast Domain with no chance of entering.

Luo Tian heard what he needed. He slowly stepped out from the crowd and joined the line.

"Hey, brother, do you have an invitation? I'll sell it to you for one million yuan energy stones!" As Luo Tian stood outside the line, someone approached him and started negotiating.

"No," Luo Tian shook his head gently. He felt amused; these people went to such extremes to show their status, even resorting to buying invitations.

"Brother, I'm telling you—this is a lot. Many people sold theirs for eight hundred thousand yuan. Think about it, it's just a wedding. If you don't watch, it's fine. One million yuan could get so many resources!" The group saw Luo Tian wasn't from a major sect and clung to him like glue.

"I said no! Can't you understand?" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness, and an icy aura radiated from him. The people surrounding him froze, then slowly retreated.

"Kid, which sect are you from? You're so bold!" As Luo Tian drove away those trying to buy his invitation, a lazy voice echoed in his ears. His brows furrowed again.

"No sect or clan!" Luo Tian turned, seeing a plain-looking young man radiating arrogance. He approached Luo Tian with a woman in revealing attire clinging to him.

"Kid, I'll pay one and a half million yuan energy stones for your invitation. Do you know who I am? I'm the Holy Prince of the Wind and Cloud Sect, Wei Qizhi! If you don't sell it, you know what'll happen!" The young man smiled triumphantly, grabbing the woman's body.

"Wind and Cloud Sect?" Luo Tian frowned. He hadn't heard of this sect before.

"That kid's in trouble. If he doesn't have a background, today he'll definitely end up with nothing!"

"Deserved! Who let him not sell it to us? He's asking for it!" Some of the previous people who wanted to buy Luo Tian's invitation smiled, ready to watch a show.

"That kid dared to offend the Wind and Cloud Sect? I heard it's just a small sect, but their headmaster married a daughter of the Yin Yang Sect. From then on, they've become arrogant. People dare not touch them because of the Yin Yang Sect's reputation!" Others also murmured, including those in front of Luo Tian who turned to look at him.

Only one day remained until the wedding. Those waiting in line were among the weakest sects invited by the Divine Clan. The powerful sects and masters had already been invited into the Divine Clan, which was why Wei Qizhi dared to be so arrogant here. After all, the Wind and Cloud Sect had the Yin Yang Sect as a backer.

"I said I don't have an invitation. Did you not hear?" Luo Tian's cold gaze swept over Wei Qizhi, sending an invisible pressure into his mind.

"Crack..." Wei Qizhi trembled. Cold sweat streamed down his face as Luo Tian's voice thundered into his mind, instantly subduing his spirit.

Facing such a low-level opponent, Luo Tian had no desire to fight. He turned back and continued the line. The people around him were stunned, surprised by Luo Tian's immense power. Though he hadn't spread his aura, they still felt the terror of his presence.

"Looks like Wei Qizhi has hit a wall. That kid might be the late Holy Prince of a major sect!" People speculated about Luo Tian's identity.

"Ugh..." Wei Qizhi took a deep breath. As Luo Tian turned again, the icy aura vanished. His eyes flashed with coldness but soon dimmed.

"Never mind. I'll just stay outside," Wei Qizhi muttered, his voice carrying a hint of retreat. The feeling Luo Tian gave him was too terrifying.

"Hmph, leave me alone then! Look at all these men around. How dangerous I am!" Upon hearing Wei Qizhi's words, the woman clinging to him protested with a sultry voice. Her body swayed in his arms.

"Sweetheart, don't be angry. I'll think of another way!" Seeing the woman's anger, Wei Qizhi quickly consoled her.

"Truly..." The people around saw the scene, their skin prickling with discomfort.

"I've heard that Wei Qizhi only loves women. He indulges in pleasures, partying every night. I heard he cultivates just to prolong his time with women!" People looked at him with disdain, whispering.

"You two, while he's not looking, kill him!" Wei Qizhi saw Luo Tian ignored them and sent a mental message to his two subordinates. His two subordinates were at the early stage of Saint and mid-stage of Saint. Wei Qizhi was confident that a surprise attack would kill the kid.

"Yes..." The two guards' expressions changed. To be honest, they didn't want to fight. Luo Tian's presence was terrifying and unreadable. However, since their master spoke, they couldn't refuse but took a deep breath.

Thinking of this, the two guards exchanged glances. Their figures moved like lightning toward Luo Tian's back, careful and ghost-like in their movements, leaving no trace.

"Why hasn't the kid reacted?" People were puzzled. They couldn't understand why Luo Tian didn't fight back.

"Boom..." As the two guards and Wei Qizhi watched with joy, their hands slammed onto Luo Tian's back.

But no blood or flesh was seen. In the next moment, everyone's eyes widened in shock.

With a thunderous sound, the two guards' figures flew back, colliding with Wei Qizhi and the woman in revealing attire. They all crashed onto the ground.

Luo Tian's lips curled into a cold smile as he slowly turned around. His gaze fell on the four people, and he sighed softly: "It seems you all don't learn from your mistakes. I told you I have no invitation, yet you still tried to attack me!"

Luo Tian took a step forward. His steps were slow, but each one caused a thunderous sound. Each footstep resonated with the Dao, as if the earth itself pulsed.

To others, Luo Tian simply walked calmly. However, to Wei Qizhi and the two guards and the woman, it felt like a catastrophe. Each step seemed to strike their hearts with thunder.

The four felt as if a primordial giant approached them, each step pressing upon them with unbearable pressure. They could explode at any moment.

After taking nine steps, Wei Qizhi and the others' blood vessels bulged out, looking terrifying. Even the woman was no exception.

They wanted to flee and beg for mercy but couldn't open their mouths. They could only watch as Luo Tian approached them.

Luo Tian took his final step, and the four couldn't withstand the terrifying pressure. Their bodies exploded, splattering blood across the ground. In an instant, they were reduced to a pile of bones.

The Dao's power spread and merged into the ground. The four who had tried to regenerate were instantly purified.

Luo Tian shook his head lightly, picked up Wei Qizhi's ring, and squeezed it. Disordered items fell to the ground. Luo Tian quickly grabbed a golden-charactered invitation and held it in his hand.

"Thanks for giving me an invitation!" Luo Tian's eyes glimmered with a smile. He walked back to the end of the line, continuing to wait.

Chapter 1,112: You're Not Worthy

Outside the Divine Clan's mountain gate, four piles of bones lay there. Luo Tian slowly turned around, his face indifferent. He knew this visit to the Divine Clan would not be peaceful. Thus, he had no reservations. Originally, he planned to wait until tomorrow, but since someone dared to offend him today, there was no choice but to reveal himself.

"Dead... dead..." People whispered in fear. They hadn't expected this young man to be so powerful, killing Wei Qizhi without even trying. And it was at the Divine Clan's gate. Knowing that the Divine Prince and Princess were to be married, it was an omen of bad luck.

In an instant, the Divine Clan's mountain gate became chaotic. People looked at Luo Tian with shock.

Those who had previously wanted to buy the invitation felt relieved, glad they hadn't forced it. Otherwise, it would have been them lying there instead of the four piles.

The young man in front of Luo Tian's line had a twitching mouth. He hadn't felt anything before, but after seeing Luo Tian easily kill Wei Qizhi and the others, he felt a chill down his spine.

"Ah, you go first!" The young man in front of Luo Tian smiled and spoke to him, moving behind Luo Tian.

"Dammit!" As the young man moved, the person in front of him muttered under his breath and trembled slightly. He also gave Luo Tian space.

One after another, the line in front of Luo Tian became empty. No one remained, leaving Luo Tian slightly speechless as he rubbed his nose.

However, Luo Tian didn't hesitate. He held the bloodstained invitation and slowly approached the Divine Clan's mountain gate, placing it before a Divine Clan disciple who collected invitations.

Previously, the two disciples hadn't seen Luo Tian through the crowd. Now, they recognized him as the one who caused the commotion and couldn't help but scrutinize him.

When they saw Luo Tian's appearance, their eyes widened in shock. They immediately reacted with alarm: "Luo Tian!"

Others might not recognize Luo Tian, but as Divine Clan disciples, they certainly knew the legendary Luo Tian.

"What? He's really here!" The two Divine Clan disciples' words were like a martial arts technique thrown into the crowd, instantly causing chaos.

"I didn't expect him to actually come. That's why he dared to kill Wei Qizhi! Compared to Luo Tian, Wei Qizhi is nothing!" People murmured excitedly, looking at Luo Tian.

"What's the problem?" Luo Tian smiled and asked the two disciples.

"Let us inform them!" The two disciples replied. One stayed behind, while the other flew into the Divine Clan's mountain.

"Ha! Luo Tian, I knew you'd come. I didn't misjudge you!" The Divine Clan disciple who had just left spoke, his voice loud. Xu Yuluo from the Shura Domain, with a blood aura, descended from the Divine Clan's mountain. Behind him was Yan Hongtao, who looked at Luo Tian with admiration.

"Saint's late stage?" Yan Hongtao felt Luo Tian's power had increased again, his face showing surprise.

"Are you ready?" At the same time, domain masters from Starry Sky Domain and Chaos Domain appeared in people's sight. They stood in the sky, accompanied by their domain's holy princes.

"Approximately," Luo Tian bowed respectfully to the domain masters in the sky, his gaze filled with respect.

"Where's Bao Yuanshan? Did that old man abandon you?" Xu Yuluo's eyes showed dissatisfaction, questioning. He clearly thought one Luo Tian was useless.

"Bao Elder has some matters and will arrive later, but I'm here. It's the same!" Luo Tian smiled calmly.

"You really dared to come!" As soon as Luo Tian finished speaking, the Divine King of the Divine Clan appeared with Sun Feiwen.

"The Divine King of the Divine Clan!" People looked at the sky's Divine King with reverence, bowing in respect. These people had never seen the Divine King before.

After the Divine King appeared, a wave of figures emerged in Luo Tian's sight. Some he recognized from the previous Demon Clan's ritual, while others were strangers. He noticed the Demon King and Nan Gong Yuqing from the Demon Clan standing with Xu Yuluo, but they hadn't approached Luo Tian. Instead, they waited silently for the situation to unfold.

"Today isn't the official day yet. Since you're my guest, I won't attack you. However, if you cause trouble tomorrow, then you'll be my enemy!" The Divine King Sun Shengtian's eyes flashed with divine light. His voice carried authority. After speaking, he waved his sleeve and vanished from sight.

"Kid, I believe in you! Good luck!" Xu Yuluo smiled and patted Luo Tian's shoulder before vanishing.

"Help will come when needed!" The Demon Clan whispered to Luo Tian, leaving Nan Gong Yuqing and taking Nan Gong Bo toward the Demon Mountain.

The Starry Sky Domain master and Chaos Domain master looked at Luo Tian deeply before vanishing as well.

With the domain masters' departure, people sighed in relief. The pressure on them lessened slightly. They looked at Luo Tian with murmurs, and some eyes held hostility.

"Luo Tian!" Nan Gong Yuqing and Zhou Wei approached Luo Tian, greeting him.

"Kid, it's been a long time. You've reached the late stage of Saint! When will we spar?" Yan Hongtao smiled and spoke to Luo Tian.

"Mine!" Before Luo Tian could respond, Zhu Ge Huangchao stepped forward with arrogance. His eyes were filled with battle spirit.

"Only you? You were defeated in a few moves before. Come to embarrass yourself!" Sun Feiwen's face showed disdain. Seeing Zhu Ge Huangchao, he couldn't help but want to hit him.

"Where's Sun Mengru?" Luo Tian asked about Sun Feiwen, wanting to know Sun Mengru's status.

"Alas... I haven't seen the Divine Princess for a long time. Even the Grand Elder hasn't seen her in a while!" Sun Feiwen's face showed bitterness, indicating he hadn't seen Sun Mengru either.

"Never mind. This isn't the place to talk. Let's go in first!" Nan Gong Yuqing spoke, looking at the people surrounding them with a frown.

"Yes. Let's go in first! Find a quiet place to talk!" Sun Feiwen spoke, leading Luo Tian toward the Divine Clan's mountain gate.

"Ha! Coming to attend a wedding and only got one invitation. And it was stolen! Truly embarrassing for the Four Sacred Star Domains. Should I give you a couple of treasures as a gift?" As people led Luo Tian into the gate, he had just placed the invitation when a voice echoed.

It was one voice, but upon careful listening, it could be heard as two people speaking. However, most couldn't detect this.

People looked around, surprised that someone dared to provoke Luo Tian. They knew who it was.

But when they saw the source of the voice, they all fell silent. The speakers were the two holy princes of the Yin Yang Sect, Lin Yangquan and Lin Yinming.

"Is it you?" Luo Tian's lips curled into a cold smile, his gaze on the two. He knew they were coming for trouble.

"What if it's us? We're just speaking kindly, a good intention!" The Yin Yang holy princes spoke in unison, their eyes flashing with endless hatred.

"Seems the lesson last time wasn't enough!" Luo Tian slowly raised his spear, "Rending Heaven," and walked toward the two with a killing intent.

People around Luo Tian gasped, their mouths twitching as they watched. They sighed inwardly: "This ancestor is really任性, killing people at the slightest disagreement. And they're all holy princes."

"I heard that last time in the Divine Beast Ancient Cave, the Yin Yang Sect was completely wiped out by Luo Tian. Two holy princes and two elders almost perished. This time, seeing Luo Tian, if they don't act, it would harm the Yin Yang Sect's reputation!" People murmured, their eyes on the three people whose fates were now intertwined.

"Get out!" As Luo Tian was about to attack, a cold voice echoed. Nan Gong Yuqing and Yan Hongtao stood by Luo Tian's side, their faces filled with murderous intent.

"What are you? Trash! You're not worthy to fight us!" Yan Hongtao spoke, showing disdain. To him, Luo Tian fighting these two was a disgrace. This was unacceptable for someone of his rank.

Not only Yan Hongtao, but Zhu Ge Huangchao and Zhou Wei felt the same. It was an insult to them. They were unusually united at this moment.

"You!" The Yin Yang holy princes' faces turned pale. Seeing the powerful figures around them, their eyes showed fear. They hadn't expected that those who had previously opposed Luo Tian would now help him against them, leaving the two confused.

"Ugh... The Yin Yang holy princes were once arrogant in the Divine Beast Domain. Now they have to act like a coward!" People smiled mockingly, watching the pale Yin Yang holy princes.

Chapter 1,113: Forging the Reincarnation Pills

Outside the Divine Clan's mountain gate, the Yin Yang holy princes' faces turned pale as they gazed at Nan Gong Yuqing and Zhou Wei, who radiated overwhelming power.

"Get out!" Yan Hongtao's cold voice echoed. His eyes were icy as he looked at the two Yin Yang holy princes.

The Yin Yang holy princes felt trapped. They hadn't expected these "fathers" to emerge so suddenly.

They were confident that if they combined their strength, they could match these top-tier talents. However, the Yin Yang Sect's depth was shallow and couldn't compare to the sects behind these people. Without their recognition, they would always be inferior.

"You two, get out! You're looking for death! I'm telling you, Yan Hongtao is saving you. Luo Tian's mood these days has been terrible. He'll kill anyone who stands in his way!" Sun Feiwen's eyes showed disdain as he spoke again.

"Goodbye!" The Yin Yang holy princes had no choice but to leave. They bowed respectfully to the group, adding another debt to Luo Tian's account. Their eyes were filled with hatred as they looked at Luo Tian.

"Ugh, such cowards. You're so scared, you can't even match us. They'll never have a chance!" Yan Hongtao and the others shook their heads, watching the two enter the Divine Clan. Their disdain grew more intense. If they had fought, they might have respected them a little more. But since they retreated, it meant they were afraid. They had lost the chance to compete with them.

"Boom..." As the Yin Yang holy princes stepped into the Divine Clan's mountain gate under people's watchful eyes, a thunderous sound echoed.

A black cauldron appeared in the crowd's sight. Luo Tian smiled and spoke softly: "No gift, it wouldn't be proper!"

"What is he doing?" People looked at Luo Tian with confusion. They watched as he raised the Zhen Hun Cauldron, waiting for his next move.

"I'm a cultivator of elixirs. Today I'll forge one batch of pills for the Divine Clan's princess and prince's wedding as a gift!" Luo Tian spoke softly. A green flame emerged from his hands, entering the Zhen Hun Cauldron's fire hole.

"Is he forging elixirs?" People looked at Luo Tian, many unaware that he was also a cultivator of elixirs.

"Ugh... He's a prodigy and an elixir cultivator. If Luo Tian grows up, he could support a sacred sect!" People sighed with admiration, whispering among themselves.

As people murmured, Luo Tian began to throw herbs into the Zhen Hun Cauldron. The aroma of medicine spread instantly.

Luo Tian hadn't forged elixirs for a long time, but his technique was still flawless. With his understanding of the Dao's power, even his elixir forging carried the essence of the Dao. Everything was natural.

"Roar..." A roar echoed as two drops of blood flew from Luo Tian's hands. Dragon and phoenix sang in harmony, with a dragon and phoenix shadow emerging from his hands. After circling the sky for a while, they were cast into the Zhen Hun Cauldron.

"That's the blood of the Dragon Ancestor and Phoenix Ancestor! One drop is priceless. Luo Tian has two drops!" People's faces showed shock as they watched the blood enter the Zhen Hun Cauldron.

"Buzz..." After the dragon and phoenix shadows vanished, a wave of energy spread. A green bamboo shoot flew from Luo Tian's hands, radiating strong vitality. It instantly swept across the entire Divine Mountain, causing the masters at the peak of Saint to open their eyes.

"So much vitality! It's a sacred herb!" People's faces showed astonishment as they watched the immortal bamboo shoot being thrown into the Zhen Hun Cauldron.

Before people's shock faded, a soft laugh echoed across the entire Divine Mountain. A white petal floated from Luo Tian's hands, black and white qi swirling within it. It alternated between white and black, constantly switching.

"What is that?"
