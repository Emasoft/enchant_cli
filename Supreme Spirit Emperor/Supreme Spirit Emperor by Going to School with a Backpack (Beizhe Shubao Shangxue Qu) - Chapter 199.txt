Luo Tian knew that if he did not fight desperately, he might truly perish here. Holding a black demonic sword, it transformed into a streak of dark light, his face resolute and fearless. He instantly appeared before the old man, the black demonic sword descending with immense force.

"You're seeking death! How can a Saintly Realm cultivator comprehend your strength?" The old man's face bore contempt. He did not even raise his weapon, instead lifting a hand radiating golden light and grasping Luo Tian's sword with it.

"Crack..." A grating sound echoed. Luo Tian, having unleashed his full strength combined with the Fana Attack Technique, was caught by the old man's hand. Yet the old man's palm remained unscathed, not even a single crack.

His jade-like hand bore a smile: "Your power is commendable. To injure me, you are not yet capable."

"Mastering the demon qi of the demonic race to such mastery is no small feat. You are indeed a promising talent for cultivation. Break!" The old man extended his hand, and the black demonic sword shattered like a toy in his grasp.

At the same time, the old man lightly lifted his foot. A surge of energy locked Luo Tian in place, causing him to tremble mentally. He felt as if trapped in a swamp, his movements sluggish. He helplessly watched the old man's golden foot strike his dantian.

Luo Tian's body flew like a meteor, his face pale and blood spilling from his mouth. He crashed into the Ten Directions Xuanyu Drum hovering in space, and a thunderous roar echoed beneath the stars.

Luo Tian slowly fell from the drum, spitting another mouthful of blood. His mind was overwhelmed with shock.

"The gap is too vast. Though my attack was merely a试探, I used eight-tenths of my strength and still failed to overcome him. He merely dismissed it with ease, leaving me wounded. Though he did not kill me, I am now unable to unleash my full strength."

Luo Tian felt his black vortex at the dantian slow after the old man's kick. His face was grim.

"Direct confrontation is no match. I must unleash the fifth and sixth blades of the Seven Demonic Blades to have a chance at victory!" Luo Tian muttered, his mind lamenting his carelessness. He had believed that with his current abilities, he could match a novice Saintly Realm cultivator. But now it was clear that he still had a long way to go. His techniques could wound but not kill.

With this thought, Luo Tian's demonic sword reformed in his hands. He gripped it tightly and slashed the fifth blade against the ancient surface of the Ten Directions Xuanyu Drum.

A massive blade's aura swept across the sky, causing the elder's eyes to narrow. He had hidden in space and felt the threat this strike posed.

"Interesting, you have some merit. But do you truly think me a target? I would not resist?" The elder's hands moved swiftly.

"Domain of the Divine!" The old man roared, golden radiance rising from his hands. He was bathed in sacred light, exuding an aura of divinity that made Luo Tian feel a sense of worship.

Luo Tian felt his blade's aura slow, its speed and power diminishing. It drifted toward the elder.

"Submit!" The old man pointed a finger, his voice laced with seduction. Like an omnipotent ruler, he touched the black blade's aura.

"Buzz..." The sound of a hum echoed. Luo Tian's fifth blade, capable of wounding a novice Saintly Realm, disintegrated under the old man's touch. It scattered into swirling black mist around him.

Even more shocking was that the dark demonic qi, instead of resisting, seemed to be assimilated by the old man. It transformed into golden sacred energy surrounding him.

"You! How many more blades can you unleash?" The old man smiled gently, his expression one of a kind elder.

"What is this technique!" Luo Tian's mind trembled. He had never seen such a skill before, marveling at the boundless wonders of the world.

"Sixth blade. Only with this can I have a chance against his current state!" Luo Tian mused, sensing the old man's growing power. It was as if a sovereign ruled over all life in this starry expanse.

"Cut the demons!" Luo Tian roared, his voice resolute. He poured every bit of his black demonic qi into the sword.

"Are you ready to fight?" The elder's face bore confidence, his gaze filled with disdain toward Luo Tian.

But in an instant, the old man's expression changed. He felt a dangerous aura forming around Luo Tian, eroding his mind. Even the old man, who was like a deity, trembled slightly.

"Buzz..." The hum echoed again. The black blade pierced through the heavens, shattering countless stars as it flew toward the elder.

The sixth blade of the Seven Demonic Blades was Luo Tian's ultimate technique. His fifth had already made the old man wary, but now the sixth brought a profound sense of crisis.

"Fana Attack!" Luo Tian sneered, adding the Fana Attack Technique to his sixth strike. The elder, a Saintly Realm cultivator, was stunned.

The black sword struck the Ten Directions Xuanyu Drum's surface, causing red fire runes to ripple. The blade's power surged again.

"Fivefold!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with excitement, feeling the sixth blade's power. After being amplified by the Fana Attack and the drum, he had finally achieved fivefold the attack's strength.

A thunderous roar echoed. The black blade severed the starry river, instantly appearing above the elder's head. A terrifying pressure enveloped him, causing even the divine elder to show a flicker of fear.

Though confident, the old man felt his life threatened by this attack. He had underestimated Luo Tian's strength.

"Refining Soul Vessel!" The old man, a cultivator of the novice Saintly Realm, roared. His golden sacred energy surged from his dantian. A green vessel emerged from his core, the old man's life-essence cultivated into a sacred artifact.

"Refining Soul!" The elder chanted, his hands forming seals. The green vessel's mouth faced downward, radiating divine light. A river of stars flowed from it toward the black blade.

"Crash..." Golden rivers met the black blade, a clash of light and darkness. They were like natural enemies.

"Insufficient! Break!" Luo Tian's roar echoed, spitting golden blood that transformed into a dragon. It surged into the sword, further enhancing its power.

The old man was ultimately outmaneuvered. Luo Tian's blade, already terrifying, combined with his desperate strike, sliced through the starry river. It appeared above the old man's head, descending with immense force.

"Damn!" The old man's eyes flashed with madness. He cursed himself for his carelessness. If he had not given Luo Tian the chance to unleash this sixth blade, Luo Tian would already be dead.

But it was too late. The black blade had descended upon the old man's head, though weakened by the Refining Soul Vessel. It still reduced the blade's power by a third. If he did not handle it properly, it could cost him his life.

"Get out..." The old man's body radiated golden light, like a legendary warrior. He had also unleashed his full strength, forming a hand to meet the black blade.

The thunderous roar exploded beneath the stars. Within hundreds of miles around Luo Tian and the old man, everything became a vacuum. A bleak atmosphere filled this starry expanse.

Luo Tian gazed at the old man, now shrouded in gray mist. This was a desperate strike. He himself was also weakened significantly, his spiritual essence and sacred energy completely drained. Especially his spiritual essence, which had been deeply wounded, would take a long time to recover.

"Cough... Cough!" A violent cough echoed beneath the stars. The old man's battered figure appeared in Luo Tian's vision, his eyes filled with intense shock.

Chapter 900: Fleeing to Tongtian Gate

In the endless starry expanse, Luo Tian stood pale as a sheet of paper. He gazed at the gray mist before him with caution. He could feel his condition was at its worst. Even a transcendent or a nine-source supreme would not kill him, but he could do nothing against them.

Luo Tian waved his hand. The green dragon seal on his arm glowed. Long Jie's figure appeared before him. Long Jie's eyes flickered with confusion, then he sensed the gray starry expanse and his body tensed.

"Cough... Go!" Luo Tian ordered Long Jie. He could no longer endure the drain and had to let Long Jie carry him. He did not care about the old man's fate, only wanting to escape. If his strike had not wounded the old man, it would have been him who was in trouble.

Long Jie said no more words. He knew this was not the time for questions. He nodded slightly, using his essence to lift Luo Tian and fly toward the distance.

But as they just took off, the gray mist surged. The old man's figure appeared, his face also weakened to the extreme. His mad voice echoed in Luo Tian and Long Jie's ears: "Kid, you do have some skill. But do you think this one strike could end my life?"

"This strike did wound me, but I can still deal with you two little guys!" The old man's face bore a hint of madness. For the proud divine race, being wounded by Luo Tian was unbearable. Even though he was not much stronger than Luo Tian now, his pride compelled him to kill Luo Tian.

"Go!" Long Jie knew the old man was hard to deal with. He unleashed his speed to the maximum, becoming a streak of gold and flying toward Tongtian Gate.

"Look how far you can run. I'll finish your nest and destroy it!" The old man sneered, stepping through space toward Long Jie's direction.

"Saintly Realm cultivators are really hard to kill!" Luo Tian, carried by Long Jie, watched the old man chasing them. His face bore a sigh.

"Roar..." A deep dragon roar echoed in the starry expanse. Feeling the old man's speed, Long Jie had no more time to waste. He transformed into his true form and placed Luo Tian on his massive dragon head, increasing their speed.

"Feeling chased is something I haven't felt in a long time!" Luo Tian's face bore a hint of nostalgia. He waved his hand, and a golden pill appeared in his palm.

The Revitalizing Pill, a sacred grade初级 pill. One of the three sacred grade初级 pills Luo Tian had cultivated in Tongtian Gate. Precious beyond measure, he now ignored everything and swallowed it, desperately restoring his sacred energy. The old man's intent to kill was clear.

"Dragon race, a dragon with blood so pure it returns to its ancestors. This kid has many treasures!" The old man's face bore greed. He had not expected Luo Tian to have such a dragon accompanying him. It was a joy for the old man, who would capture and subdue it. Once this dragon grew strong, it would become a great cultivator.

But the old man was also wounded and could not match Long Jie's speed immediately.

A hundred-zhang-long golden dragon flew through the void, passing countless stars. Some people of the Fire Domain looked up with admiration.

"That dragon is from the Dragon Race! It's truly powerful. If I could subdue it, would I not be invincible in the Fire Domain?" People gazed at Long Jie as he flashed across the sky.

But they only marveled slightly. They knew such a dragon was beyond their reach.

"Someone is sitting on the dragon's head!" Someone finally noticed Luo Tian's figure, their face filled with respect. Though they could not see his appearance clearly, just the fact that he had subdued a dragon was enough to make them look up in awe.

The golden dragon tore through the stars. The old man following closely left people stunned, feeling his immense pressure. Though his cultivation had dropped, the aura of a Saintly Realm was still present, enough to terrify them.

"What is he? Transcendent or Saintly Realm? My god, the dragon's master is being chased by a great cultivator. It's definitely not something we can get involved with!" People murmured, their eyes filled with excitement. Some even wanted to transform into dragons and follow the old man's path, wanting to witness how terrifying a great cultivator's attack was.

"Stay strong! You must stay strong!" Long Jie clearly fought with all his might. He knew if the old man caught up, both he and his brother Luo Tian would die.

Two streaks of gold flew like meteors toward the Tongtian Continent.

Just as Long Jie carried Luo Tian away and the old man left, waves of spatial disturbance echoed beneath the stars where they had been. Lu Tianyu and Du Yuying's figures appeared in the starry expanse.

Du Yuying's face was pale. Lu Tianyu also trembled, but he gently patted her back to comfort the frightened girl.

They had arrived long ago. They witnessed Luo Tian's battle with Ma Tianyang and the old man of the divine race. They had watched from the void, too afraid to emerge.

"Terrifying!" Du Yuying buried her head in Lu Tianyu's arms, trembling. Since childhood, she had been cherished by Du Hongtao and never seen any cruel scenes. Thinking of the previous battles and Ma Tianyang's death, she shivered.

"Come on, brother. Let's go back. We've been out too long; your father will worry!" Lu Tianyu sighed, praising Luo Tian's strength while speaking gently to comfort Du Yuying.

"Big brother Tianyu, will Luo Tian die? Tell me a fortune! That old man was so scary. Ma Tianyang and the others were killed by one slap..." Du Yuying's face bore不忍, though she had no fondness for Ma Tianyang and the others, they were people from her childhood.

Lu Tianyu sighed helplessly at the girl. He thought she was too innocent, so much that it made him unable to be angry. Even though he had lied about being able to tell fortunes, she believed it.

"It's possible he might die. Alright, let's go!" Lu Tianyu pulled Du Yuying and turned to fly toward the Shanhai Pavilion.

"No! That old man is a bad guy. I want to avenge Ma Tianyang and the others!" Du Yuying's face bore determination, grabbing Lu Tianyu to chase after Luo Tian.

"Ridiculous!" Lu Tianyu's face finally darkened at Du Yuying's words. The previous battle between Luo Tian and the old man had not affected them, which was fortunate. Now this girl wanted to run into their arms, it was no wonder Lu Tianyu's face darkened.

"Big brother Tianyu!" Du Yuying blinked her eyes, full of pleading. This was always her trick, and it worked every time. Lu Tianyu would always agree.

"Can't..." Lu Tianyu looked at her expression, his heart trembled. But he finally bit his teeth and refused.

"Hmph... You won't stop me!" Du Yuying saw this trick failed, pouted her lips and moved swiftly toward the Tongtian Continent.

"Ah..." Lu Tianyu sighed, patting his head in frustration. With this girl's strength, he really couldn't stop her unless they fought to the death.

Lu Tianyu sighed and took out his jade token, sending a message to Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian. His body flashed, chasing after Du Yuying.

"Ha! I knew you wouldn't let me go alone!" Du Yuying's eyes formed a crescent moon. She kissed Lu Tianyu's face fiercely.

Lu Tianyu's face turned hot, his whole body jolted. He looked at Du Yuying and lightly scolded: "Hmph, you're already so big, yet still so troublesome!"

Though Lu Tianyu's face was serious, his heart felt like being struck by lightning. A current of electricity ran through him.

...

Outside Tongtian Mountain, four transcendent-level masters looked at the Tongtian Continent with a hint of seriousness. If Luo Tian were here, he would recognize them as the four transcendent-level masters who had been driven away by Ma Tianyang and others.

These four were of similar status to Ma Tongtian in the Fire Domain, slightly weaker than him. After all, Ma Tongtian had the support of Shanhai Pavilion's Ma Feiyang and his family. No one dared to move against him.

"According to logic, that kid should have already died. Why hasn't the news come yet?" A large man among them looked impatient.

"Be patient. That kid has some skill. Didn't you see him beating Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu so badly at Shanhai Pavilion? I feel he's about to die. Once he dies, Tongtian Gate will still be ours! Let's agree first: the stone wall left by Gu Tianshu, we'll all study it together!" A middle-aged man with a scar on his face looked expectantly at the massive stone wall on Tongtian Mountain.

All four were transcendent-level masters. They had long coveted the stone wall on Tongtian Mountain, but due to Ma Tongtian's presence and his support from Shanhai Pavilion, they had dared not act. Now that Ma Tongtian was killed by Luo Tian, Tongtian Gate became a target for them. Whether it was the stone wall left by Gu Tianshu or Tongtian Gate's power, they were all their goals.

Previously, the four had ordered their disciples to watch Tongtian Gate's movements. They hadn't seen Luo Tian leave the gate. When they saw him at Shanhai Pavilion's marriage competition, he was now a member of Tongtian Gate and so powerful that it had subdued their eager hearts.

But now, knowing Luo Tian was being chased by Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu, they realized their chance had come. In their minds, Luo Tian was definitely dead.

So the four didn't hesitate and gathered their disciples, waiting for news of Luo Tian's death. Once it came, they would attack.

...

Chapter 901: Coincidence

In Tongtian Gate, Wang Xuanyang's face bore a hint of anxiety. Beside him sat Song Yongkang, the head elder who had just ascended to transcendent-level. His face was also bitter. Other elders looked at Song Yongkang and Wang Xuanyang with various expressions.

In recent days, under Song Yongkang's full support, Wang Xuanyang had finally secured the position of Grand Master.

But these days, other sects from the star domain of Tongtian Continent had arrived. These people naturally knew that Song Yongkang hadn't expected someone to trouble Tongtian Gate so quickly. And it was four sects, all of equal strength to Tongtian Gate. This made the people of Tongtian Gate uneasy.

"What should we do, Grand Elder? These people clearly want to divide our Tongtian Gate. Now that Luo Tian is not here, with just us, we can't match these four sects!" A nine-source elder spoke, his voice heavy with concern. The atmosphere in the hall grew even more oppressive.

"Have you identified which four sects?" Song Yongkang was also anxious, but he knew he couldn't show it. If he panicked, the people of Tongtian Gate would lose heart.

"Those are Wen Chongxiu from Xiao Yao Wu, Han Guangxian from Feixue Dao, Mu Yulong from Chihong Que, and Lu Xingping from Zhanlang Gu!" A elder spoke. Each name he said made the atmosphere in the hall heavier, and everyone's eyes focused on Song Yongkang and Wang Xuanyang.

"Retreat. I feel they're after the stone wall on Tongtian Mountain. After all, every Grand Master in history entered the Saintly Realm by sitting under that stone wall. So the Fire Domain has rumors about a secret to enter the Saintly Realm on this stone wall.

"Ah... Retreat. There's still a chance. If two transcendent-level masters, with Tongtian Array, could possibly resist and even kill them. But four of them... we have no chance at all!" Song Yongkang made a decisive decision and immediately instructed the elders.

Wang Xuanyang nodded. Now that Luo Tian was not here, the best way was to retreat. They would decide when Luo Tian returned. After all, Tongtian Gate's current strength was not enough to fight these four sects.

With Wang Xuanyang and Song Yongkang's decision, Tongtian Gate began to act. Each elder wore a heavy expression as they organized the disciples of Tongtian Gate to prepare for evacuation.

The disciples of Tongtian Gate didn't know about the danger facing their sect, but they could sense the heavy atmosphere from the elders and the new Grand Master Wang Xuanyang. They felt a sense of impending storm.

Then, each elder conveyed the news of their evacuation to the disciples. The entire Tongtian Gate's disciples knew that there must be some great enemy coming, one capable of forcing the powerful Tongtian Gate to retreat. Such a threat must have the power to destroy Tongtian Gate, otherwise no Grand Master would make such a decision that harmed their prestige and the sect's foundation.

With the elders' organization, after half a day, all of Tongtian Gate's disciples gathered. Their eyes bore reluctance as they looked at the massive mountain of Tongtian Gate.

...

Outside the Tongtian Continent, the four sects' Grand Masters bore impatience. They had waited for two days without any news of Luo Tian.

"What should we do?" Han Guangxian from Feixue Dao looked anxious. Naturally, they had felt the movements of Tongtian Gate and knew it was about to evacuate entirely. This loss would be significant for them, as just one Tongtian Mountain was not enough to satisfy them. They needed all of Tongtian Gate's resources.

"Attack! If we don't, there's nothing left. That kid might have died. Perhaps the three major sects are afraid of Gu Tianshu's existence and have covered it up!" Wen Chongxiu from Xiao Yao Wu spoke seriously, his eyes looking at the people of Tongtian Gate flying out. The leader was Grand Elder Song Yongkang and Grand Master Wang Xuanyang.

"Stop them!" Wen Chongxiu's four men, their eyes flashing with cruelty, surrounded Tongtian Gate for so long. How could they let it leave so easily?

"Grand Elder Wen, we've already evacuated Tongtian Gate. What else do you want?" Song Yongkang's face bore a heavy expression, looking into the distance and directing the disciples of Tongtian Gate to stop.

"Nothing. Leave all your resources behind, and you can leave after lowering your cultivation to the Boundary Lord level!" Wen Chongxiu's face bore a playful expression as he spoke to Song Yongkang.

"Grand Elder Wen, don't be too bold. If we fight to the death, I believe you'll also pay a heavy price!" Song Yongkang's face was cold. Their conditions were too harsh to accept.

"Then I'll have to let this newly ascended transcendent-level Grand Elder of Tongtian Gate perish!" Wen Chongxiu's face bore a hint of smile, his aura rising.

"Fight! Activate the Tongtian Array!" Song Yongkang felt the four's auras and their tense state. He roared at his disciples.

"Roar..." But just as Wen Chongxiu and the others were about to issue an attack, a thunderous dragon roar echoed in their minds.

"What is this!" Wen Chongxiu's four men bore a hint of seriousness. Their eyes saw a golden dragon flying swiftly from the starry expanse toward Tongtian Gate.

"Did you hear? Luo Tian once killed Ma Tongtian with a dragon race in the fire sea. This dragon must be the one that saved Luo Tian. If this dragon has returned, then is Luo Tian also here?" People looked at the golden dragon in the sky with fear. Their minds trembled.

"That's Luo Tian!" Mu Yulong from Chihong Que finally looked at Luo Tian seated on Long Jie's head with fear.

"Done. This kid didn't die! My god, those were four semi-Saintly Realm masters! They couldn't even kill this kid. Then how about us, four transcendent-level masters? We're not enough for even one slap of his!" Wen Chongxiu's group was completely panicked. Their eyes looked at Long Jie and Luo Tian, who were just a few hundred miles away from the Tongtian Continent.

Long Jie was also exhausted. Two days of full-speed travel had taken a toll on him. He knew he could barely last half a day before the old man caught up.

"Luo Tian!" Song Yongkang's face bore a hint of excitement. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to return at such a critical moment.

Luo Tian's strength had been heard by Song Yongkang in recent days. He had stepped on Jin Tianlu, fanned away Ma Tianyang, ignored the faces of three major sects' Grand Masters, and even walked out confidently from Shanhai Pavilion. Such deeds had spread throughout the Fire Domain.

"He's injured!" Wen Chongxiu's face bore joy, sensing Luo Tian's weakness. He shouted loudly, his eyes filled with a hint of joy.

"That means there's still a chance!" Han Guangxian and the others' eyes flickered, their gaze toward Luo Tian becoming more lively.

"Brother, we've arrived at the Tongtian Continent!" Long Jie's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, making him slowly open his eyes.

After two days of recovery, Luo Tian's injuries were five-tenths healed. His face had regained a hint of redness. He looked at the four men, Wen Chongxiu and others, his brows slightly furrowed. But sensing their hostility, he knew they wanted to attack him and the Tongtian Continent.

"What should I do?" Luo Tian's eyes were anxious. There were four transcendent-level masters and their disciples in front, and a semi-Saintly Realm old man behind. At this moment, Luo Tian felt immense threat.

Though Gu Tianshu was below, he didn't want to let him act. Gu Tianshu was his greatest secret. No matter the reason, Luo Tian didn't want to use him.

But even at his peak, this crisis might not be solvable. And now he was over-extended.

Luo Tian's brows furrowed deeply, his mind quickly calculating how to face this crisis. He had experienced countless crises before. Even now, he remained clear-headed.

"Got it!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with determination. A plan formed in his mind, his gaze filled with a hint of mischief toward the four men approaching.

"Hmph! Daring to invade my Tongtian Gate while I was wounded. Though I'm injured, who doesn't have a few friends!" Luo Tian's voice carried disdain as it echoed in the four men's minds.

"Huh?" The four men looked at him with confusion. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to have allies, and the old man's cultivation was clearly not weak.

"Ha! How dare you come to my base. If you're brave, attack me!" Luo Tian laughed loudly, his voice filled with endless arrogance. He moved toward Wen Chongxiu and the others.

"Kid, where are you running? This is your base in the Fire Domain!" The old man didn't regard these people as anything, his face filled with disdain as he chased after Luo Tian. But to Wen Chongxiu and the others, it seemed like Luo Tian was leading the old man toward them.

"Damn! Kill! What's with this old man? It's just one more!" The four men's eyes flashed with cruelty. They rushed toward Luo Tian and the old man.

...

Chapter 902: Instant Teleportation

Outside the Tongtian Continent, Luo Tian and Long Jie faced four sects' transcendent-level Grand Masters in front of them, while a semi-Saintly Realm old man chased them from behind.

In Luo Tian's prime, facing two groups would not be a problem. But now, despite having recovered some strength after two days of rest and using the sacred grade初级 pill, he still knew he was no match for both sides.

In a flash of inspiration, Luo Tian turned the two groups into enemies and rushed toward each other.

"Four transcendent-level masters are a big deal for others, but to me, they're just insects. Even if I'm injured, what are you?" The old man's face bore contempt as he controlled his wounded body to attack Wen Chongxiu and the others. Though injured, the old man was a novice Saintly Realm cultivator. After two days of recovery, his strength returned much faster than Luo Tian's.

Luo Tian was sandwiched between the two groups. In an instant, both sides surrounded him. But Luo Tian's face was calm, his body still rushing toward Wen Chongxiu and the others.

"Kid, you're seeking death! Just because of an old man's help doesn't mean you can beat us! Kill!" Facing a wounded Luo Tian, the four men were undeterred. They each held their weapons and advanced toward Luo Tian.

Song Yongkang, standing on the Tongtian Continent, now understood Luo Tian's situation. He wanted to help but was stopped by Luo Tian's voice: "Return! Both sides are our enemies!"

"My god!" Song Yongkang's heart trembled. He couldn't believe the old man, who had terrified everyone, was also chasing Luo Tian.

"Retreat..." Song Yongkang's face bore bitterness. He ordered everyone to retreat back into Tongtian Mountain. He knew there was no way out for Tongtian Gate now. He could only hope Luo Tian would turn the situation around, create a miracle, or fight both sides to mutual injury so he could take advantage. Otherwise, Tongtian Gate would be destroyed by either side.

"Is it possible?" Song Yongkang looked at Luo Tian, whose face was pale to the extreme. His heart felt despair.

Luo Tian remained calm. In an instant, he rushed toward Wen Chongxiu and the others, his face filled with mockery: "Want to take advantage of my illness? You're not qualified!"

"Hmph! Just because of this old man, you think you can turn the tables? Dream on!" Wen Chongxiu sneered. His eyes were filled with excitement. He raised his long sword, which radiated a terrifying aura, and slashed toward Luo Tian.

At the same time, the other three men also unleashed their killing techniques. They knew Luo Tian's strength and that if he caught his breath, they would be no match for him.

Four powerful techniques surged with immense energy. Each aimed to kill, instantly rushing toward Luo Tian.

"Kid, where are you running?" The old man also roared with coldness. He formed a golden hand seal, pressing down toward Luo Tian. Its power was no less than the four men's combined effort.

Long Jie felt the two overwhelming forces behind and in front of him. His heart trembled. Others might not know, but Long Jie knew both sides were targeting Luo Tian.

"Brother, what should we do?" Long Jie spoke tremblingly, his eyes filled with fear. This was the first time he felt death so close.

"Relax!" Luo Tian's hands formed seals. He showed no fear against the four men's attack, instead wearing a mocking smile. A series of waves radiated from his hands, affecting both himself and Long Jie.

"Refining Soul Body, Instant Teleportation!" Luo Tian roared. Golden seals wrapped around him and Long Jie, emitting a blinding golden light. In an instant, they vanished from people's sight.

"What happened? Where did they go!" Wen Chongxiu and the four men were stunned. They were confident that even if Luo Tian was fast, their techniques could track him. But now, it seemed as if both Luo Tian and the young dragon had vanished into thin air. Even their techniques lost track of his direction.

Wen Chongxiu and the four men were shocked. The old man, a novice Saintly Realm cultivator, was also stunned. Having lived countless years, he had never seen such a situation.

"Strange kid, you do have some skill!" The old man muttered, his face bearing a hint of ferocity.

"You can run, but your subordinates and this sect cannot. You may escape for now, but I don't believe you can run forever!" The old man's voice was cold. He looked at his hand seal and the four men's techniques colliding, creating a thunderous sound.

"I don't know how long I can stop them. Once I eliminate all your subordinates, I'll wash this continent with blood and turn it upside down. Where will you run then?" The old man's mind whispered, his hands moving as he surged toward Wen Chongxiu and the others.

"Old man, it's all your fault. Today we'll first kill you, cutting off Luo Tian's arm. Then we'll find that kid!" The four men saw the old man rushing toward them and were undeterred. They unleashed their techniques, colliding with the old man.
