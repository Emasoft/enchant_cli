“Fu Xingxuan, I shall take her to reunite with her family!” Luo Tian spoke, intending to reclaim Fu Xingxuan, as she had been alone at the Reincarnation Bridge for too long.

“Hmph, take her then,” Hei Bai Wu Chang replied. After such a long time, he too felt guilty toward Fu Xingxuan.

“However, you must protect her well—she is of greater importance than anyone else!” Hei Bai Wu Chang cautioned. Fu Xingxuan was crucial to the Reincarnation Hell, and no mishap could be allowed.

“Of course!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with determination. Now, he possessed the means to safeguard others.

Luo Tian, Hei Bai Wu Chang, and Du Jianhang exchanged further words before departing the Reincarnation Hall with Fu Xingxuan, flying toward the City of King Zou.

“Will the Holy Son and Holy Daughter return?” The disciples of the Reincarnation Hall murmured as Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan left.

“I shall return!” Just as the disciples whispered, Luo Tian’s voice echoed through the Reincarnation Hall, lifting their spirits.

Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan walked hand in hand beneath the blackened heavens, their figures gliding through the void. With the conflict at Luo Sheng Gate subdued, Hell had entered a brief calm. Yet, infiltrators from Luo Sheng Gate still seeped into Hell’s cities and towns.

Accumulating sand into a tower, though each grain seemed insignificant, when amassed, it became an indomitable force.

Time passed swiftly; three days later, Luo Tian led Fu Xingxuan back to the City of King Zou.

In those few days, the people of the City of King Zou had prepared to depart for the Central Three Heavens.

“Welcome back!” Su Dan’s face lit with a smile as she saw Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan return.

“Fu Xingxuan!” Su Dan rushed forward, embracing Fu Xingxuan. The two sisters had not seen each other in ages.

Their embrace sent a wave of warmth through Luo Tian, making his nose tingle as if the very sky dimmed.

“Fourth Aunt!” Luo Li and Luo Xiting stood respectfully, addressing Fu Xingxuan.

“You’ve grown so much,” Fu Xingxuan surveyed the children with a smile.

“All is prepared; we may depart at any moment!” Su Cheng addressed Luo Tian, initiating the assembly of the City of King Zou’s people.

Chapter 2778: Reunion

Under the blackened heavens, over a million souls marched—residents of the City of King Zou relocating to the Central Three Heavens.

After ten days of travel, the main force finally reached Hell’s edge—the former Bountiful Heaven City. Yet now, it belonged to the Tianyuan Sect, as they were near its borders. If another faction held it, their safety would be compromised; thus, the Tianyuan Sect guarded Bountiful Heaven fiercely.

“Almost home!” Luo Tian mused, leading the City of King Zou’s people to Bountiful Heaven’s gates.

As Luo Tian and his group neared the city, its inhabitants spotted them immediately, preparing for battle.

“Who?” On the walls stood several figures, led by two elders who recognized Luo Tian at once.

“Master Lu, Master Meng, I’ve returned!” Luo Tian laughed, addressing the city’s defenders—Lu Chong, master of Chen Zhanbiao, and Meng Wushuang.

“Luo Tian!” Lu Chong and Meng Wushuang’s faces bore disbelief; they had not expected Luo Tian to return from Hell.

“Open the gates!” They commanded their subordinates, then descended from the walls to meet Luo Tian’s group.

“What is this?” Lu Chong and Meng Wushuang gazed at the City of King Zou’s people, eyes filled with confusion.

The City of King Zou ranked among Hell’s Eight Great Cities, its strength formidable—though not as mighty as the Tianyuan Sect, it surpassed former Central Three Heavens’ sects.

“Enter first,” Luo Tian smiled, bowing to Lu Chong and Meng Wushuang before leading them into Bountiful Heaven.

Bountiful Heaven had transformed; it was now bustling, with countless shops and throngs of people.

“Let them camp outside,” the City of King Zou’s leader ordered, instructing their people to stay beyond the gates. A million and nearly two hundred thousand souls could not enter at once without chaos. Observing Bountiful Heaven’s splendor, the City of King Zou’s leader marveled; born in Hell, its environment was far harsher than the Celestial Heavens. Though the Celestial Heavens also practiced survival of the fittest, they were gentler than Hell. The City of King Zou, though prosperous, still lagged behind Bountiful Heaven.

“During this time, the Central Three Heavens’ Commercial Association partnered with the Tianyuan Sect to establish numerous shops. We are their protectors; they handle construction,” Lu Chong explained to Luo Tian, who now understood.

“Indeed!” Even Luo Tian had not anticipated Bountiful Heaven’s grandeur.

The group reached the city’s main hall, where Meng Wushuang arranged for them to enter a grand hall.

“This is my father-in-law, once one of Hell’s Eight Heavenly Kings—King Zou.” Luo Tian introduced King Zou to Lu Chong and Meng Wushuang.

After a brief exchange, the three delved into business.

“We shall take over Bountiful Heaven; it is near Hell!” King Zou declared, stating his intent.

King Zou’s words gained Meng Wushuang and Lu Chong’s agreement. If Bountiful Heaven were guarded, its people could be deployed to the Central Three Heavens’ battlefield.

“Currently, our forces have repelled Hell’s army. We’ve also received news—likely due to Luo Sheng Gate, the Yama and Ten Palaces lack time to manage the Central Three Heavens. Now only the Celestial Heavens’ several mountain realms remain. If we repel them, the entire Central Three Heavens shall be ours!” Meng Wushuang spoke, detailing the Central Three Heavens’ situation to Luo Tian and King Zou.

“Have those peak Celestial Kings not descended?” Luo Tian’s concern focused on the apex Celestial Kings, his curiosity piqued.

“Soon,” Lu Chong replied. “It’s been years since Gu Tianwu and the蛮王 fought Yama, but those mountain realms are still testing us.”

Lu Chong’s mention of the apex Celestial Kings was the most formidable challenge.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian nodded, finding this battle less dire than Yama’s Ten Palaces’ assault on the Tianyuan Sect. At least, there were fewer apex Celestial Kings; Mount Suzhi and Bountiful Heaven had not participated. The newly formed Tian Dao Mountain was likely a pawn.

“Who dares strike first, I shall kill them! I doubt they fear death—or I could act preemptively to intimidate!” Luo Tian muttered, strategizing.

After further discussion, Luo Tian led his children and Su Dan from Bountiful Heaven toward the Tianyuan Sect. The handover was left to King Zou and Meng Wushuang.

“Hah! Finally out of the City of King Zou!” Luo Su shouted, flying joyfully beneath the gradually blue heavens. His exhilaration was genuine.

“Look at how he’s been cooped up!” Luo Tian remarked, smiling as he watched Luo Su’s joy.

“Nonsense! What if he gets hurt? He isn’t your flesh and blood, so you wouldn’t care!” Su Dan glared at Luo Tian, making him grimace.

“Boys must be allowed freedom! See how Luo Li and Luo Xiting developed? They’re doing well. He needs to see the world!” Luo Tian countered, sensing Su Dan’s overprotectiveness toward Luo Su.

“Still, still!” Su Dan dismissed it, yet her eyes remained fixed on Luo Su, fearing for his safety.

Time passed slowly; three days later, Luo Tian, Fu Xingxuan, and Su Dan arrived at the foot of Mount Tianyuan with their children.

“Hah! You’ve finally returned, we were desperate!” As Luo Tian appeared, several figures descended from Mount Tianyuan, eyes alight with excitement.

Since his last journey into the small world to seek the World Heart, Luo Tian had been silent. Their worry was immense until Bountiful Heaven’s stone confirmed his safety, easing their minds.

Diao Dezhu, Sun Kienian, Jiang Sixi, Sun Mengru, and Gu Qiansnow appeared, their gazes on Luo Tian.

“Xiting!” Jiang Sixi glanced at Luo Tian before spotting Luo Xiting beside him, her eyes alight with joy. She rushed toward Luo Xiting.

Gu Qiansnow, Zheng Xin’s couple, and Gu Lei also arrived at the children’s side. Jiang Sixi and Gu Qiansnow had not seen their children in a long while; hearing of the collision between the Nine Domains and the Celestial Heavens, they had feared for Luo Li and Luo Xiting’s lives. Their emotions were palpable.

Chapter 2779: Arrival at the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain

Luo Tian’s return invigorated the entire Tianyuan Sect. His presence was a spiritual pillar for them all.

Soon, reports of victories flooded in—Long Jie and Chen Zhanbiao, among others, launched attacks to hasten their return.

Within the Tianyuan Sect’s hall, its core members sat densely, filling the chamber.

“Now, the Tianyuan Sect holds two-thirds of the Central Three Heavens. Only one remaining stretch remains, and the Celestial Heavens’ people still struggle to endure,” Jiang Nanxuan spoke, updating Luo Tian on the Central Three Heavens and the Tianyuan Sect.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian nodded, saying little. The current state was evident to him.

The Tianyuan Sect now brimmed with power, its ranks bolstered by the Nine Domains’ new bloodlines. Given time, it would birth endless strength—though it required patience.

“The sole issue now is the Celestial Kings. After Gu Qian and the蛮神 departed, they have not returned. Thus, if apex Celestial Kings descend from the Upper Three Heavens, we lack anyone to counter them,” Jiang Nanxuan continued.

“Nearly two years have passed; I believe they’ll soon lose patience,” Jiang Nanxuan added, gazing at Luo Tian. His return had eased their dilemma.

“What strategy?” Luo Tian replied. His original intent was to ensure the Tianyuan Sect and those around him no longer suffered oppression. Though he harbored no desire for conquest, to avoid bullying, one must strive for dominance.

“Strike first!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke, surprising the hall’s attendees. Who would have thought Jiang Nanxuan so bold?

“Hmph,” Luo Tian nodded, agreeing with Jiang Nanxuan’s plan. Rather than waiting for others to attack, they should strike first.

“Have you set your target?” Luo Tian asked. Though he had considered it, he had not detailed a plan. Jiang Nanxuan’s suggestion implied thorough contemplation.

“Fu Xingyang was captured at the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain, so I intend to focus there. I need time to finalize the plan,” Jiang Nanxuan replied, his ideas built on the Tianyuan Sect’s apex Celestial King strength. Luo Tian’s return was timely.

“I suppose we’ll exert effort!” Luo Tian chuckled, Fu Xingyang had been detained too long; he felt guilt toward Fu Xingyue.

“The Eastern Emperor’s Mountain, yes!” Luo Tian murmured, his eyes cold. Once, he had faced the world alone—Nine Celestial Mountains and Yama’s Ten Palaces had left no room for him or the Tianyuan Sect. Now, it was time to reclaim what was owed.

“Also, the Immortal King and Tian Dao Mountain!” Luo Tian clenched his fists, intending to depart after stabilizing the Tianyuan Sect. He would visit the Reincarnation Hall with Run Hongyu and Jiang Yuexiong to check on Hei Bai Wu Chang. He doubted three combined forces could not heal them.

“Also, the King of Ghosts Sect—Gu Qiansnow’s other half remains there. We must reunite them!” Luo Tian resolved, no matter the cost—steal or bind—it was imperative to retrieve Gu Qiansnow’s other half.

For the following days, Luo Tian remained at the Tianyuan Sect, enjoying rare respite with his wife and children.

On the third day of his return, Chen Zhanbiao returned, concluding his assigned battle. On the tenth day, Long Jie led the Tianyuan Sect’s warriors back to their domain. Three months later, Yao Chen returned. With his return, the entire Central Three Heavens fell under the Tianyuan Sect’s control. Instantly, the Tianyuan Sect became the dominant force in the Central Three Heavens, with all cities and towns submitting.

None had expected the Tianyuan Sect to reach such strength, seizing control of the Central Three Heavens.

“Three times now, the Central Three Heavens have changed hands!” Yet people still doubted the Tianyuan Sect. After all, the Nine Celestial Mountains and Yama’s Ten Palaces had not fully mastered it. They believed these forces would retaliate.

As everyone debated, twenty figures appeared above the Upper Three Heavens’ Eastern Emperor’s Mountain, gazing at its towering form. Their eyes were icy.

*Buzz…*

The twenty figures’ aura spread, coalescing into an oppressive atmosphere.

*Boom…*

A bell’s sound rang out, sending a formidable wave against the twenty figures’ aura.

“World Treasure—Eastern Emperor’s Bell!” A solemn voice echoed. These were Luo Tian and his group.

Luo Tian stood there, with Yao Chen, Chen Zhanbiao, Long Jie—this generation, even Lu Chong and Xiang Tianming had arrived.

With nearly ten Celestial Kings at the late stage, thirteen at the middle stage, almost all of the Tianyuan Sect’s strength had come. Only Jiang Sixi and other female retainers remained behind.

“Who dares trespass on my Eastern Emperor’s Mountain!” A furious shout echoed, as figures surged upward. The leader was the Eastern Emperor Taiyi.

“Luo Tian!” Seeing Luo Tian, Eastern Emperor Taiyi’s face shifted, also spotting Yao Chen and others.

The other Eastern Emperor’s sect members inhaled sharply; Luo Tian’s group far exceeded their strength.

“Luo Tian, what brings you to my Eastern Emperor’s Mountain?” Eastern Emperor Taiyi’s face darkened, yet he did not back down.

“Always you attacked us; reciprocity is courtesy. Thus, we’ve come!” Luo Tian coldly replied, his spear in hand, gazing at Eastern Emperor Taiyi.

“Kill!” Luo Tian’s words had barely finished when Yao Chen surged forward, battle intent blazing. Luo Tian moved swiftly, unwilling to waste time; his purpose was to kill and intimidate, showing other Celestial Mountains they were not to be trifled with. They could unite against them, but must prepare for a flesh-tearing fate!

Luo Tian roared, his demonic wings unfurling. His speed surpassed Yao Chen’s, instantly appearing before Eastern Emperor Taiyi.

“Daring to come here!” Eastern Emperor bellowed, brandishing a golden divine sword. It unleashed ten thousand feet of radiant light, slicing toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian raised his spear to block the golden blade’s collision, shattering it before him and pushing himself back two steps.

“Unexpectedly, you’ve come to us!” Eastern Emperor’s voice darkened, yet he sent messages to other apex Celestial Kings.

Chapter 2780: The Eastern Emperor’s Bell Appears

“One hour!” Luo Tian mused, recalling his plan. They would attack for one hour; if longer, other apex Celestial Kings would arrive, turning their intimidation into a trap.

In an instant, Luo Tian struck again, his body expanding dramatically. His Law of the World was activated as he stomped toward Eastern Emperor Taiyi.

“Just entering the apex Celestial King stage, yet you dare trespass on my Eastern Emperor’s Mountain. Who gave you the courage!” Eastern Emperor saw Luo Tian’s footfall and remained calm, his hands moving. A golden seal rose, crushing the heavens and earth toward Luo Tian.

*Boom…*

The thunderous sound echoed, and Luo Tian’s body was pushed back. Yet he continued striking six steps toward Eastern Emperor Taiyi.

Eastern Emperor’s aura surged, his low shouts producing golden hands to clash with Luo Tian.

*Boom… Boom…*

Six resounding booms shook the heavens and earth, shaking the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain. As their confrontation escalated, Yao Chen and Long Jie also found their opponents, engaging in battle.

The ordinary disciples and elders of the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain watched in terror, cowering under their protective array. They gazed at the bloodshed above.

The Eastern Emperor’s Mountain had been overwhelmed by Yao Chen and Long Jie, now standing independently. Their numbers were three times that of the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain, and they quickly fell into a defensive position.

“Too terrifying! This is the Tianyuan Sect? This is their strength?” The Eastern Emperor’s Mountain people were awestruck, watching the sky collapse as if facing annihilation. They hoped Eastern Emperor Taiyi could hold out; otherwise, the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain would be doomed.

Luo Tian wielded his spear, becoming a supreme warrior. Each attack forced Eastern Emperor Taiyi to fight with all his might.

Yet, Eastern Emperor was a veteran, the pinnacle of the Celestial Heavens. Facing Luo Tian’s relentless assaults like waves crashing against a shore, he remained fearless, each time countering effortlessly.

Time passed slowly; one hour had elapsed. Blood began to fall from the sky—blood of the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain warriors.

“Eastern Emperor’s Bell!” Seeing his sect members nearly overwhelmed, Eastern Emperor Taiyi’s face darkened. He finally activated their secret weapon—the world treasure of the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain, the Eastern Emperor’s Bell.

*Buzz…*

As Eastern Emperor Taiyi shouted, waves of energy rose from the mountain. A golden ancient bell materialized above his head.

*Boom…*

The Eastern Emperor’s Bell rang out, its sound echoing across the heavens. Luo Tian’s attack struck the bell, and the immense recoil sent him flying.

“Eastern Emperor’s Bell! A world treasure!” The Eastern Emperor’s Mountain people cried out, eyes ablaze with fervor.

As the bell’s sound rang, an invisible wave spread outward. The Yao Chen group, who had been attacking the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain warriors, were simultaneously struck by a gust of wind and spat blood.

“This is the power of a world treasure!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, sensing the Eastern Emperor’s Bell surpassed even an apex Celestial King—provided it was activated by one.

“How many times can you activate it?” Luo Tian sneered, flipping his hand to reveal a copper mirror before him.

“What?” Eastern Emperor Taiyi’s eyes narrowed. They had thoroughly studied Luo Tian’s abilities, knowing his methods.

“Destruction Light!” Luo Tian pressed his hand, and the ultimate divine light erupted from the mirror. In an instant, it appeared before Eastern Emperor Taiyi, causing his face to shift.

Destruction power struck Eastern Emperor Taiyi—only he could withstand it; others would be instantly destroyed.

The divine light rained down, and the Eastern Emperor’s Bell erupted with ten thousand feet of radiant light, shielding Eastern Emperor Taiyi. It clashed with Luo Tian’s destruction light.

*Boom…*

The bell rang again, a violent wave rising from the Eastern Emperor’s Bell. The surrounding area trembled, and Yao Chen’s group turned pale.

“Luo Tian, we can’t hold on!” Diao Dezhu cursed, flying backward and spitting blood.

“Apologies,” Luo Tian said, gazing at the battered Diao Dezhu. This strike had nearly cost him half his life; if repeated, they would be annihilated without the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain attacking.

“Luo Tian, what do you have to fight me with? I possess the Eastern Emperor’s Bell—a world treasure. This ensures my invincibility!”

“Do you think the Celestial Mountains’ resources are for show?” Eastern Emperor Taiyi roared, his voice through the bell.

“Ah,” Luo Tian nodded. A world treasure was indeed absent from his arsenal, but it was merely an obstacle for him.

“Come forward!” Luo Tian barked at Diao Dezhu and others, ordering them to stand behind him.

“Even if you unite your attacks, you cannot break the Eastern Emperor’s Bell!” Seeing Luo Tian’s move, Eastern Emperor Taiyi scoffed. He then unleashed divine light, enclosing his sect members within the bell’s protection.

“Not breaking?” Luo Tian sneered, flashing a crimson divine light in his hand. A curse echoed through the heavens.

“Luo Tian, you’re not human! That’s a world treasure!” A shout echoed, causing the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain people to pause.

*Boom…*

But soon after, a crimson stone erupted, expanding like an asteroid that obscured the sky. It crashed toward the glistening Eastern Emperor’s Bell.

A formidable pressure swept across nine heavens and ten earths, causing the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain people—including Eastern Emperor Taiyi—to pale.

“Unleash it!” Eastern Emperor Taiyi gritted his teeth, sensing that if he were struck by the stone, he would be shattered.

*Buzz… Buzz…*

The bell’s sound was piercing; the Eastern Emperor’s Bell erupted with ten thousand feet of divine light. The sect members within it poured their cultivation into the bell.

In an instant, the red asteroid collided with the Eastern Emperor’s Bell, sending a thunderous boom across the heavens. This explosion carried the ultimate law’s power, shaking eight directions and even alarming other Celestial Mountains.

On Mount Bountiful Heaven, a gray sword radiated divine light, its battle intent rising.

“World treasure in combat!” Bountiful Heaven’s Celestial King frowned, gazing toward the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain and taking flight.

Other Celestial Mountains’ world treasures also issued warnings, causing their people to tremble.

“Already using the world treasure so soon!” The apex Celestial Kings heading toward the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain quickened their pace.

Chapter 2781: The Soul of Tai Cang

*Boom…*

A thunderous explosion echoed above the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain, as its protective array cracked. The sect members within the bell spat blood and trembled violently.

Luo Tian’s group had already retreated miles away, gazing toward the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain.

A crimson divine light soared from the shattered sky, and the Bountiful Heaven Stone screeched, shrinking to palm size before returning to Luo Tian’s hand.

“Luo Tian, I say nothing more—without half a ghost vein, I won’t get up!” The Bountiful Heaven Stone shouted, its voice filled with anger.

“Eastern Emperor’s Mountain has a ghost vein, you can try it—though finish the task first!” Luo Tian grimaced, watching the Bountiful Heaven Stone’s antics.

“Ghost vein! Right! This Eastern Emperor’s Mountain has existed for ages; it must have treasures!” The Bountiful Heaven Stone’s greedy voice echoed.

“Those two boys, you let go—his is mine!” The Bountiful Heaven Stone shouted angrily, trying to escape Luo Tian’s grasp.

As the Bountiful Heaven Stone spoke, two figures within the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain froze and quickly retreated into a secret chamber.

They were Sima Tuo and Sun Kienian, who had not joined the battle but infiltrated the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain. Their mission was to find Fu Xingyang.

“Stay still!” Luo Tian barked, their main goal being to rescue Fu Xingyang before intimidating the Nine Celestial Mountains. Everything revolved around rescuing Fu Xingyang.

“Ugh…” The Bountiful Heaven Stone relented slightly but continued muttering, making Luo Tian’s head ache. He vowed to have Gu Guanyu and Zheng Xin talk with the stone later.

The storm faded, and the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain people appeared before Luo Tian’s group, their faces pale. They gazed at the unassuming crimson stone in Luo Tian’s hand.

“Master, rest assured—the bell cannot threaten you now. You may fight freely!” The Bountiful Heaven Stone’s assurance echoed, making Luo Tian pause.

“Damn! Why can’t the Eastern Emperor’s Bell be activated!” Luo Tian was stunned as Eastern Emperor Taiyi’s voice rang out.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian narrowed his eyes, surprised the Bountiful Heaven Stone’s words were true. He gazed at it, suspecting it had regained some strength.

“Master, now is the time to let me go—I’ll scour for treasures!” The Bountiful Heaven Stone, uncomfortable under Luo Tian’s gaze, spoke quickly.

“Fine!” Luo Tian released it, and the Bountiful Heaven Stone flew out like a wild horse, laughing as it vanished. No one could find it.

“Continue!” Luo Tian barked. This back-and-forth had wasted time; they had only half an hour left. No one was dead, but it wasn’t enough to intimidate the other Celestial Mountains.

*Buzz…*

Luo Tian pressed his hand against the孽障镜, unleashing the remaining five destruction lights toward Eastern Emperor Taiyi.

With a technique of breaking through void, Luo Tian vanished from his spot, and Yao Chen, Chen Zhanbiao, and others roared forward toward the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain.

“Kill!” Eastern Emperor Taiyi’s face darkened, surging out of the bell with a golden sword.

*Boom… Boom…*

Five destruction lights shattered before Eastern Emperor Taiyi, each one pushing him back a thousand feet and drawing blood from his mouth.

“Emperor’s Heaven!” Eastern Emperor Taiyi roared, his hands moving to summon a golden sun that crushed the heavens.

At the same time, Luo Tian’s body appeared at the golden sun’s location, wrapped in golden patterns. His spear pierced through space toward Eastern Emperor Taiyi.

“Six Paths of Reincarnation!” Luo Tian roared, his spear unrelenting. He raised a fist to strike the golden sun.

*Puff… Boom…*

Two sounds echoed before Luo Tian and Eastern Emperor Taiyi, with the spear piercing Eastern Emperor Taiyi’s shoulder. The golden sun also exploded above Luo Tian, sending a violent wave against him.

Luo Tian’s body fell but steadied itself instantly, charging toward Eastern Emperor Taiyi again.

“I won’t back down!” Eastern Emperor Taiyi was fearless, his body glowing with golden divine patterns. He clashed against Luo Tian’s Law of the World.

The thunderous clashes continued, shaking the heavens and earth. The Eastern Emperor’s Bell outside also saw Yao Chen’s group engage in battle.

The violent waves continuously struck the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain’s protective array, causing it to tremble. After a moment, it shattered with a loud *boom*.

As the array broke, the battle’s waves surged outward. The Eastern Emperor’s Mountain buildings began to collapse in large numbers, and its people fled, scrambling for survival.

Though the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain people evacuated quickly, many still perished under the waves’ impact. After all, Celestial Kings and True Celestial Kings were too weak before Luo Tian’s group.

“Deploy the Emperor Array!” A voice cried out among the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain disciples. Over ten million people gathered, forming a golden dragon.

A powerful aura rose from the dragon’s scales, each one realistically detailed. The entire group was enveloped by the golden dragon.

However, the dragon did not join Luo Tian’s battle; if it did, each confrontation would drain too much from the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain. The golden dragon merely hovered in the air, protecting its people.

Time passed; finally, a Celestial King at the middle stage was killed by Long Jie. Blood rained from the sky.

“Enough deaths!” Eastern Emperor Taiyi gazed at his struggling people. If they all died, the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain would suffer greatly.

“Only then can I use him!” Eastern Emperor Taiyi’s face bore reluctance, but he continued battling Luo Tian. His other hand constantly cast seals, descending from the sky and imprinting onto the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain.

“Hmph?” As Eastern Emperor Taiyi cast his seals, Luo Tian felt a surge of danger.

*Boom… Boom…*

The thunderous sound echoed across the heavens, and a wave of gray energy appeared. The winds swirled as if awakening some seal. A gray shadow materialized before Luo Tian’s group.

“My ancestor, the Soul of Tai Cang!” Eastern Emperor Taiyi roared, a drop of his blood flying to the gray shadow’s forehead.

Chapter 2782: The Slave Seal

In a dimly lit chamber, a gaunt figure was bound by various divine seals. His body seemed to have lost its form entirely.

This man was the main target of Luo Tian’s assault on the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain—Fu Xingyang.

At this moment, Fu Xingyang bore no resemblance to his former self; he had become a skeleton, his aura weak.

Opposite him stood an immense array, its air thick with black mist and emitting a terrifying aura. Yet this aura seemed to fear Fu Xingyang, bypassing him to flee beyond the chamber.

“An array!” Two furtive figures entered the chamber, gazing at the black mist pouring out of the array.

“Found it!” Upon seeing Fu Xingyang, they joyfully rushed in, approaching his side.

“Why are you here?” Fu Xingyang’s weak voice echoed. Though he still had strength, his voice was barely audible.

“Looking for you!” Sun Kienian and Sima Tuo replied, their eyes filled with sorrow as they approached Fu Xingyang.

The divine seals shattered in their hands, freeing Fu Xingyang. Without hesitation, Sun Kienian and Sima Tuo supported him, fleeing the chamber.

“Someone disturbed the chamber?” As they rescued Fu Xingyang, Eastern Emperor Taiyi sensed it.

*Buzz…*

A powerful spiritual soul凝聚ed, emitting a formidable pressure that crushed the heavens. All eyes turned to the gray figure.

“My bloodline!” Instantly, most of the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain people felt their bloodlines being drawn. As the figure solidified, their bloodlines ignited.

“Tai Cang?”

“Eastern Emperor’s Mountain is descended from the Human Emperor Fuxi, right?” Luo Tian wondered, gazing at the figure’s growing power.

The wave spread outward, enveloping all around. The gray figure stood proudly in the heavens, radiating a powerful aura.

*Boom… Boom…*

In an instant, the people whose bloodlines were awakened emitted a series of booming sounds. Their power surged dramatically.

“Ah…” A chorus of roars echoed as they clashed with Yao Chen and Long Jie, their power now surpassing the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain warriors. For a moment, they held back Yao Chen’s group.

“This spiritual soul!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed; he could sense it was incomplete, yet its power was still peak.

However, this soul could not attack but instead enhanced the Eastern Emperor’s Mountain people’s strength.

“Still, what do you have to fight me with? Other factions will arrive soon; then all of you shall die!” Eastern Emperor Taiyi roared, clashing fists with Luo Tian.

“Time is tight,” Luo Tian mused, only a quarter of an hour left until the hour was up.

“Yet I have many methods to deal with spiritual souls!” Luo Tian sneered, his soul energy bursting outward as a soul blade. It slashed toward the gray spiritual soul.

The unique aura of a Soul Sealer made the spiritual soul tremble, yet it could only stand there.

*Roar…*

The next moment, the soul blade struck the spiritual soul, causing it to howl and its aura weakened slightly.

“Unexpectedly, you wounded my ancestor!” Eastern Emperor Taiyi was stunned; he knew Luo Tian had methods to harm spiritual souls but hadn’t expected this.

“Ancestor Tai Cang, a true emperor!” All hearts were awestruck.

“Ancestor? Who’s ancestor? You claim to be descendants of the Human Emperor Fuxi, yet you have an ancestor named Tai Cang!” As everyone was awestruck, a weak but authoritative voice echoed—Sun Kienian and Sima Tuo appeared with Fu Xingyang.

“Is that prisoner!” The Eastern Emperor’s Mountain people gasped, surprised the prisoner was still alive.
