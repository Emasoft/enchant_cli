Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao's expressions slightly shifted. They had already prepared to flee, but they hadn't expected Luo Tian to have drawn the Rending Heaven Spear, intending to fight a Soul-Annihilation Realm powerhouse.

"Luo Tian, shouldn't we retreat first and wait..." Xu Liyi, seeing the unhidden battle fervor on Luo Tian's face, spoke softly.

"No need! Rest assured, I have confidence!" Luo Tian let out a light laugh, his gaze filled with self-assurance.

He had already slain a Soul-Annihilation Realm beast in its early stage, and although this elder radiated an overwhelming presence—perhaps even stronger than that white bear of the Soul-Annihilation Realm—he naturally had the confidence to back it up. Even if he lost, he could escape gracefully and still not be stopped by Jiang Taihong.

"Suicidal!" Jiang Taihong let out a low roar, grasping a long staff in his hand. His figure moved like lightning, sweeping toward Luo Tian with a fierce strike.

"Both of you scatter! Take out the people behind this old dog! I'll handle him!" Luo Tian sneered, unleashing three strikes of the Rending Heaven Spear. His feet danced with the Sealing Heaven Step, charging toward Jiang Taihong.

"Crack..." Before Luo Tian's words had finished, the Rending Heaven Spear clashed with Jiang Taihong's staff. A black fissure appeared between their attacks, and a brilliant white light suddenly illuminated the sky.

Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao hadn't even reacted, already stunned by how quickly Luo Tian and Jiang Taihong had clashed. In the next moment, they felt a tingling in their ears.

Jiang Taihong's group of over a hundred people, most of them spat blood from their mouths, eyes filled with terror as they gazed at the two battling in the sky.

"The power of a Soul-Annihilation Realm master is truly terrifying!" Xu Liyi marveled, watching the two clash in the sky. Even with his own eyes, he couldn't discern their battle's details; cracks of void continuously formed in the sky, and waves of terrifying energy erupted from their battlefield.

"Kill them!" At that moment, the flames on the ground had died out. Some of Jiang's clan members in the Body-Refining and Bone-Fragmenting realms had landed on the ground, while several Soul-Annihilation Realm masters stood in the sky, eyeing Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao with predatory gazes.

The Soul-Annihilation Realm masters, gazing at the ruined Feiyan City—now reduced to a flat expanse by Luo Tian's Burning Heaven Fire—had eyes nearly bleeding with fury.

At that moment, Feiyan City lay in ruins, no longer resembling a city. A faint breeze swept through, carrying only ashes swirling in the sky, leaving no trace of its former existence.

"Kill!" The Soul-Annihilation Realm Jiang clan members, eyes brimming with endless hatred, rushed toward Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao. After all, they were Luo Tian's companions; now they sought to kill anyone connected to him.

"Hah! A fight!" Chen Zhanbiao had long felt restless, and now that someone was charging toward him, he let out a joyous laugh.

"Smack..." Xu Liyi slapped Chen Zhanbiao's head, shouting loudly.

"This isn't a fight! Fight freely, and kill them all! Did you hear me!" After issuing the command, Xu Liyi rushed toward three Soul-Annihilation Realm mid-stage masters. His hand now held a golden long sword, its three elemental energies surging as he charged forward with a roar.

Chen Zhanbiao had always followed Xu Liyi, and upon hearing Xu's command to fight freely, his face lit up with joy. He called out: "Big brother, did you give me that thing!"

"Uh..." Xu Liyi's figure paused mid-motion. Then, he suddenly remembered something and smacked his waist pouch.

"Buzz..." Two black hammers materialized in Xu Liyi's hands.

As soon as the hammers touched his grasp, Xu Liyi's body slightly descended.

"Take it!" Xu Liyi gritted his teeth, veins bulging on his arms as he spun around and hurled one hammer toward Chen Zhanbiao.

"Whew..." Xu Liyi took a deep breath, then brandished his long sword again, charging toward the three.

"Got it! Hehe!" Chen Zhanbiao caught both hammers in his hands, a satisfied expression on his face. The two hammers collided, generating ripples that made the air around him unstable.

"Kid! Die!" One Soul-Annihilation Realm mid-stage and two early-stage masters, seeing Chen Zhanbiao laughing foolishly, surged forward with murderous intent.

"Roar..." Upon seeing the three charging at him, Chen Zhanbiao showed no fear but instead let out a fierce roar. His black hammers swung fiercely, deflecting the three's attacks. The other hammer smashed into one of the early-stage masters.

"Crack... Boom..." Before the early-stage master could recover from Chen Zhanbiao's single strike that had deflected all three attacks, he was struck by another hammer.

In that blow, the early-stage master's body turned into a pile of flesh, then launched like a cannonball to the ground, collapsing in death.

Meanwhile, Xu Liyi wielded his golden long sword with overwhelming power, slicing through one mid-stage Soul-Annihilation Realm master. Blood rained from the sky, splashing onto the ground.

Chapter 573: The Completion of the Burning Soul Technique

The Jiang clan members on the ground looked terrified, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao and Xu Liyi in the sky.

These dozens of people hadn't expected that, in their view, the powerful Soul-Annihilation Realm masters of their clan had been slain by two young men in an instant. As for Luo Tian, he was even more terrifying—capable of battling the city's lord.

"Run!" The people on the ground now had only one thought: to flee. Three powerful opponents far exceeded their expectations.

But they dared not run; if they truly fled, they knew Jiang Taihong would kill them instantly.

Helpless, the people on the ground could only pray silently for Jiang Taihong's victory. Otherwise, their fate would be unbearably grim.

"Boom..." Luo Tian, his face alight with battle fervor, clashed with Jiang Taihong, secretly pleased.

"Indeed, human flesh and beast flesh are incomparable!" Luo Tian mused inwardly.

Previously, during his fight with the white bear on Ice Island, he had fought hesitantly, as ordinary attacks could not harm the bear. But now, clashing with Jiang Taihong, his physical body was no less than the elder's.

Jiang Taihong, however, grew increasingly alarmed. He hadn't expected this youth's physical body to have reached such a terrifying level, even surpassing his own after being reinforced by seven elemental energies.

"I won't believe it! Your martial arts can't be stronger than mine!" Jiang Taihong sneered, retreating ten thousand feet away. His hands moved swiftly.

"Your martial arts!" Luo Tian saw Jiang Taihong retreat and felt the terrifying energy radiating from him. He knew Jiang Taihong was about to unleash his martial arts, and his expression darkened.

Humans may lack the physical strength of beasts, but their martial arts were far superior. Only beasts with ancestral legacies could rival humans.

Luo Tian's dark expression faded momentarily, his hands moving swiftly. His left hand formed the King of Men Seal, and his right hand the Soul-Stealing Seal. They fused together.

"Shura Beast Hand!" Jiang Taihong roared, and a blue hand seal materialized above Luo Tian's head. Pressing waves of pressure bore down on him.

"Boom..." As this hand seal appeared, the Emperor Seal Luo Tian had been fusing was shattered by the overwhelming pressure.

"Kid, this is the power of Soul-Annihilation Realm! Crush him!" Jiang Taihong's hand slammed downward, a sinister grin on his face.

The blue hand seal tore through the void, shattering it wherever it passed. It landed on Luo Tian's head as if to tear him apart.

"Sealing Soul Vessel!" Luo Tian's face darkened, and he instantly summoned his Sealing Soul Vessel toward his head.

"Boom..." The heavy vessel's body was struck by the blue hand seal, emitting a thunderous roar like a cannonball. It crashed to the ground, piercing it and creating a dark hole visible to all.

"Not done yet!" Luo Tian's heart trembled; he didn't care about the Sealing Soul Vessel flying away. He focused on the blue hand seal descending upon him.

"Boom..." In Luo Tian's momentary distraction, the blue hand seal struck his body.

"Gasp..." Luo Tian was likewise reduced to the Sealing Soul Vessel's fate, coughing up blood and being slammed to the ground.

A massive handprint formed on the earth, while Luo Tian lay battered and pale as a sheet, his back drenched in blood.

"Lord Jiang's might!" The remaining dozens of people shouted joyfully.

"Kid, this is the true Soul-Annihilation Realm! You're still too weak!" Jiang Taihong sneered from the sky.

"Rude!" Luo Tian sneered, green energy surging as his碧晶琉璃火 (Bijing Lilu Fire) flew into the crowd, enveloping the noisy Jiang clan members.

"Yelp!" A scream erupted instantly. Under the Bijing Lilu Fire's terrifying heat, the remaining dozens of people turned to ashes, vanishing into the world.

"You!" Jiang Taihong's face boiled with anger. By killing these people, the Jiang clan now had only him and four Soul-Annihilation Realm masters left. No, it was now two—because Chen Zhanbiao and Xu Liyi had each killed another during the battle.

Luo Tian's face was pale as he returned to the sky, his gaze filled with grim determination toward Jiang Taihong.

Luo Tian had indeed underestimated himself, thinking his half-step Soul-Annihilation Realm strength and abilities could maneuver with a Soul-Annihilation early-stage opponent. But now, he realized the true terror of a Soul-Annihilation early-stage master.

"You must die!" Jiang Taihong's fingers moved again, his gaze filled with boundless hatred. The blue hand seal slowly coalesced once more.

"Old dog! Today, you are my first Soul-Annihilation Realm kill!" Luo Tian sneered, slapping his head.

"Golden Soul! Come out!" With a slap, a golden phantom appeared before Luo Tian—identical to him. This was his golden-element Soul-Annihilation spirit.

"Hmm?" Seeing Luo Tian summon a soul, Jiang Taihong frowned, unsure of what Luo Tian was up to.

Luo Tian's lips curled slightly as he bit his finger, drawing blood. His fingers began to carve strange symbols in the air, which transformed into blood energy and were imprinted onto the golden spirit.

"Shriek..." As Luo Tian finished carving, the golden spirit suddenly ignited.

"Not enough!" Luo Tian slapped his hand again, and the wood and water spirits erupted forth. Under his fierce gaze, they also ignited.

"Draw in..." Luo Tian took a deep breath, inhaling the three burning spirits into his body.

"Suicidal!" Jiang Taihong's face showed disbelief at Luo Tian's actions.

But in the next moment, Jiang Taihong's expression changed abruptly as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"Boom..." After absorbing the three spirits, Luo Tian's pale face suddenly turned crimson. His aura surged skyward.

"Crack..." As if something had shattered within him, the world's elemental energy abruptly stilled.

"The Burning Soul Technique is complete!" Luo Tian opened his eyes, a playful glint in them. He flexed his hands, a satisfied arc on his lips.

"The true sensation of Soul-Annihilation Realm... quite good!" Luo Tian sighed, his figure flickering like a ghost, appearing before Jiang Taihong. He struck with One Strike to Annihilate Life.

Chapter 574: Brief Soul-Annihilation Realm

Luo Tian's figure flickered like a ghost, instantly appearing before Jiang Taihong. A powerful aura radiated from his seemingly ordinary fist, filling the space between them with gray mist.

"Soul-Annihilation Realm!" Jiang Taihong's eyes widened in disbelief. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to have transformed into a Soul-Annihilation Realm master.

"Boom..." Jiang Taihong, indeed a Soul-Annihilation Realm master, was stunned but reacted instantly. His Soul-Annihilation Realm power surged forth, and a blue fist met Luo Tian's strike.

"Gasp..." But in the next moment, Jiang Taihong's figure vanished from sight, appearing ten thousand feet away. He spat blood, his face filled with disbelief. His aged visage looked like withered bark.

"Ten thousand years of vitality!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with joy. He hadn't expected his progress into the Soul-Annihilation Realm to be this great, even making One Strike to Annihilate Life so terrifying.

One single strike of the One Strike to Annihilate Life had cost Jiang Taihong ten thousand years of vitality. Ten thousand years was a significant blow to a Soul-Annihilation Realm master, even if it seemed trivial compared to their tens of thousands of years lifespan. The higher one's cultivation, the more they cherished life. Perhaps it was this ten thousand years that allowed a Soul-Annihilation Realm master nearing their limit to stop at the Soul-Annihilation stage, dying with regret.

Moreover, Luo Tian now had confidence that, in his current state, he could annihilate any Soul-Annihilation Realm master.

"Shura Beast Hand!" Jiang Taihong's eyes held a flicker of panic, using his martial arts again. At this moment, Luo Tian felt like a stronger presence than himself.

"Now your martial arts mean nothing to me!" Luo Tian sneered, his aura resplendent. He rushed directly toward the blue hand seal in the sky.

"Go..." Luo Tian flew to the blue hand seal's position, roaring and striking it with a fist.

"Boom..." A thunderous explosion echoed upward. The water-element energy blue hand seal was shattered by Luo Tian's fist, dispersing into countless fragments that drifted through Feiyan City. The once scorching air felt slightly moistened.

Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao, with one hammer and one sword, unleashed devastating attacks. They had slain their last opponents, gazing at the mighty Luo Tian in the sky with awe.

"Old dog, I want to see how you can interrupt my martial arts now!" Luo Tian sneered, his hands leaving trails of afterimages in the air.

"Damned!" Seeing Luo Tian use martial arts, Jiang Taihong cursed under his breath. His hands moved again, a grim expression on his face.

"Opening Heaven!" Luo Tian roared, unleashing the Opening Heaven Seal. The sky darkened under his roar, swirling gray energy evoking a sense of returning to the world's beginning.

"Buzz..." A buzzing sound echoed through the void, as if breaking free of celestial constraints. Golden seal corners gradually emerged.

A terrifying pressure enveloped the entire Feiyan City, even those who had escaped felt a shudder of fear.

The Opening Heaven Seal, after Luo Tian's entry into the Soul-Annihilation Realm, had its power amplified. It erupted from the void like a world-ending force.

"Apocalypse Shura Finger!" Sensing the terrifying seal, Jiang Taihong's face paled slightly. He roared and unleashed his strongest martial art.

"Rippling..." A torrent of waves surged from Jiang Taihong's body, forming a hundred-foot wave that suddenly rose. Feiyan City was instantly transformed into an ocean.

But soon, as Jiang Taihong's movements continued, the waves compressed into a single massive finger floating above his head.

"Go..."

"Crush it!" Luo Tian and Jiang Taihong, as if guided by some unseen force, both roared. The golden "Heaven" seal and the Shura Finger surged with overwhelming power, colliding in a cataclysmic explosion.

"Boom..." As if the world had ended, a powerful shockwave erupted from the sky. The invisible wave even caused Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao to lose their footing, swaying.

A golden mushroom cloud rose after the thunderous explosion, and vast voids collapsed under the gaze of Luo Tian and his companions. Black space was revealed.

"This attack would leave even a Soul-Annihilation Realm master dead or severely injured!" Xu Liyi couldn't help but sigh.

Chen Zhanbiao's body trembled, his perception far beyond ordinary humans. He stared in terror at the collapsing sky.

"Buzz..." The mushroom cloud hadn't even dispersed when, in an instant, a golden seal burst forth from it, directly smashing toward Jiang Taihong.

"Hmph!" Jiang Taihong sneered and unleashed the Shura Beast Hand, rushing toward the Opening Heaven Seal. The two clashed with a thunderous roar.

After Jiang Taihong's two martial arts blocked the Opening Heaven Seal, it lost its power and dissipated into swirling energy.

"Kid, what else do you have? Use it!" Jiang Taihong's face bore a sneer but his mind was grim. He gazed toward Luo Tian.

"Disappeared!" Jiang Taihong's face showed a flicker of surprise, gazing at the spot where Luo Tian had stood. He moved instantly, unwilling to stay in place.

"Too late!" A cold voice echoed from Jiang Taihong's back, startling him. He exerted all his strength to leap into the void.

"Gasp..." But Jiang Taihong was too slow, a black fissure appearing behind him. A spear tip, gleaming with cold light, pierced through his shoulder.

"Alas... alas!" Luo Tian's sigh echoed in Jiang Taihong's ears, causing him to ignore the wound on his shoulder. His face bore a look of terror as he gazed around.

At this moment, Jiang Taihong was thoroughly terrified by Luo Tian's methods. Though he wasn't a Soul-Annihilation Realm master, his physical body was no match for Jiang Taihong's. Even more, he could enter the Soul-Annihilation Realm through secret methods, and his combat power was stronger than Jiang Taihong's.

Feeling the tearing pain of the wound on his shoulder, Jiang Taihong felt a desire to retreat. But recalling that Luo Tian had destroyed their clan and ruined his life's foundation, he couldn't accept it.

Moreover, Jiang Taihong knew that Luo Tian had entered the Soul-Annihilation Realm through secret methods. The difference between this method and a true Soul-Annihilation Realm master was time! As long as Luo Tian's secret method's duration passed, Jiang Taihong was certain that Luo Tian would weaken to an extreme. After all, the cost of entering the Soul-Annihilation Realm was not something ordinary people could bear.

Chapter 575: He Fled

"Kid, how long can you endure?" Jiang Taihong roared, his figure darting through the sky to avoid being locked down by Luo Tian.

After piercing Jiang Taihong's shoulder with his spear, Luo Tian appeared in the sky.

Seeing Jiang Taihong darting like a monkey, Luo Tian's lips curled slightly.

Jiang Taihong was correct—he had entered the Soul-Annihilation Realm through a special method. This method was also known to Luo Nan Tian and Luo Zhan. It was the Burning Soul Technique.

The Burning Soul Technique was created by Luo Tian's grandfather, Luo Xiong. Before leaving, he had passed it on to Luo Nan Tian and Luo Zhan. Luo Zhan had used this method to maintain their clan's position on Ice Island.

This time, Luo Tian returned to Ice Island without entering the Soul-Annihilation Realm and was able to use the Burning Soul Technique. Luo Nan Tian, worried about his son's safety, had taught it to Luo Tian.

After Luo Tian employed the technique, he indeed felt its astonishing power and marveled at his grandfather's genius for creating such a method.

Of course, there were side effects to using the Burning Soul Technique: burning one soul meant seven days of no cultivation. Luo Tian had burned three souls, meaning twenty-one days without any ability. In other words, he had sacrificed twenty-one days as an ordinary person to gain this brief hour in the Soul-Annihilation Realm.

"Old dog! Do you think I can't kill you?" Luo Tian sneered, his Rending Heaven Spear slicing through the void. Cracks formed in the air as he leapt into it with the Sealing Heaven Step.

"Crack..." In the next moment, Jiang Taihong's back was again disturbed by spatial fluctuations. Another shoulder burst forth with blood, a black dragon emerging from his body.

Jiang Taihong's face turned pale, his body constantly moving to evade Luo Tian's attacks.

But Luo Tian wouldn't give him a chance, continuously leaping into the void and striking with his spear. Each strike added another wound to Jiang Taihong's body.

"Can't do this! I must flee, or else within an hour, I'll be exhausted to death!" Jiang Taihong's face bore a decisive expression. He had decided to leave.

At this moment, Jiang Taihong's figure was in a pitiful state, his entire body wrapped in blood, darting through the air.

"Run..." Jiang Taihong seized an opening, his speed suddenly surging into a blue afterimage, vanishing from the spot.

"Want to escape? If you had fled at the beginning, I might not have been able to catch you. But now that you're wounded, where do you think you can run?" Luo Tian sneered.

"Gun of the Heavens!" A cold voice echoed in Jiang Taihong's ears, startling him.

It seemed he had been preparing for a long time, holding back his rage. A black spear shadow suddenly pierced through the void toward Jiang Taihong at breakneck speed.

"Danger!" Jiang Taihong's heart filled with intense danger the moment the massive spear shadow appeared.

"Brace yourself!" Jiang Taihong, no stranger to the years of dominance over Feiyan City, showed decisive resolve.

"Crack..." Jiang Taihong bit his finger, drawing four drops of blood that surged with overwhelming energy into his body.

After absorbing the four drops, Jiang Taihong's blood qi surged skyward. His speed increased to another level, his body transforming into a red light that vanished from sight.

"Boom..." Luo Tian held the Rending Heaven Spear, forming a massive spear shadow that pierced into nothingness. The sharp energy sliced through the void above.

"Escaped!" Luo Tian gazed at the blinding red light, knowing that even with his Sealing Heaven Step, he couldn't catch up. He could only shake his head from the sky, sighing inwardly. Even with entering the early Soul-Annihilation Realm, it was still difficult to completely eliminate an early Soul-Annihilation Realm master.

Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao looked at Luo Tian with admiration, giving him a thumbs-up. They watched as he descended from the sky.

"Brother, you're really fierce! You've forced an early Soul-Annihilation Realm master to burn his blood and flee!" Xu Liyi spoke.

Luo Tian smiled bitterly, speaking softly: "The next part of the journey will depend on you. Take me with you; for the next twenty days, I'll be an ordinary person. This is the cost of becoming a Soul-Annihilation Realm master!"

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Xu Liyi was stunned. He nodded slightly, knowing that gaining power always came with an equivalent cost.

"Soul-Annihilation Realm early stage... Soul-Annihilation Realm peak... Bone-Fragmenting peak... Body-Refining realm..." As Luo Tian's words finished, his aura rapidly declined. His eyes held a bitter expression; his body felt as if sealed, unable to move even a single thread of energy.

Luo Tian was relieved that his consciousness remained and he could still open his storage pouch. He took out a second-grade elixir, placing it in his mouth to recover from his injuries.

Luo Tian wasn't seeking higher-grade elixirs; in his current state, without energy to refine them, a second-grade elixir was the limit. If he took higher-grade ones, they would burst him. He silently thanked himself for having made many second-grade elixirs in the Locking Demon Tower, otherwise it would have been a problem.

Thinking of his past experiences in the Locking Demon Tower, Luo Tian slapped his head and suddenly remembered that several people in the Southern Region still owed him money. A nostalgic smile appeared on his face. It had been years since then, and now Luo Tian was a half-step Soul-Annihilation Realm master, his strength far greater than before.

"I wonder how they're doing now... How much progress have they made? Chen Changsheng hasn't seen me in a long time. I suppose we'll meet in the Ancient Immortal Ruins!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian reminisced, Xu Liyi used his energy to lift Luo Tian into the sky. His thoughts were interrupted.

"Lead the way, brother!" Xu Liyi spoke, his first time in the Northern Region. He clearly didn't know how to proceed.

Luo Tian smiled lightly, guiding Xu Liyi on the path. The three transformed into a meteor and vanished from the completely destroyed Feiyan City.

Those who hadn't dispersed yet looked at their retreating figures with reverence.

"Three people! Destroyed a city guarded by a Soul-Annihilation Realm master. Such achievements, in the younger generation, this Five Elements Sect prodigy must be unprecedented!" People marveled as they approached the ashes of Feiyan City.

But when people reached the location of Feiyan City's teleportation array, they were all stunned. They discovered that the city's teleportation array was no longer functional!

Chapter 576: Life as an Ordinary Person

Luo Tian and his companions flew swiftly. Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao pushed their speed to the limit; after all, Luo Tian's current state didn't allow for leisurely travel. In just three days, they reached the foot of Five Elements Sect's mountain.

"This is the Five Elements Sect? It doesn't seem special at all!"

"Big brother, I'm hungry!" Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao looked at the Five Elements Sect's grand mountain gate.

"Let's go in!" Luo Tian landed on the ground, stretching his arms with a relaxed expression. On the journey, he had been tense constantly—after all, he had made many enemies. If something unexpected happened, it would be a sad death.

The three walked up the mountain and reached the gate. The gatekeepers naturally recognized Luo Tian, checked his identity token, and respectfully let them into the Five Elements Sect.

Under the respectful gazes of various sect disciples, Luo Tian and his companions finally reached the Dan Pavilion. They didn't stop but directly headed toward Lu Kunpeng's residence.

Lu Kunpeng was currently leisurely reading a pharmacopoeia in the alchemy room, seemingly having forgotten about his curse. His face was extremely focused.

"Senior Grandmaster, I'm back!" Luo Tian and Xu Liyi stood at the door, addressing Lu Kunpeng's room.

As he was reading, Lu Kunpeng suddenly moved, appearing before Luo Tian and his companions. His gaze held joy as he looked at Luo Tian.

"Hmm?" Sensing Luo Tian's fragility, Lu Kunpeng's face turned grave with deep regret.

"What happened to you? Why are you like this?" Lu Kunpeng's tone carried reproach. He pulled Luo Tian from Xu Liyi's arms and placed his hand on Luo Tian's wrist.

"It's fine... it's just temporary. I'll recover in twenty days!" Luo Tian smiled lightly, feeling warmth as he recounted the events of these three months to Lu Kunpeng.

When Lu Kunpeng heard that they had destroyed the entire Feiyan City, his brows furrowed.

"Never mind; it's destroyed now!" A careless voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears, making him smile again.

Zhang Ziping and Lei Yong's figures appeared at the door of Lu Kunpeng's room, their faces filled with joy. They had heard that Luo Tian was back and guessed he would come to Lu Kunpeng's place immediately.

Unlike Lu Kunpeng, when Zhang Ziping saw Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao, his face slightly paused before a kind expression appeared. They knew Luo Tian was brought back by Xu Liyi, so they naturally understood that the two were friends of Luo Tian. If not for this, the two would have betrayed him long ago.

"Respectfully, I am Zhang Ziping. Thank you both for taking care of my younger brother!" Zhang Ziping and the others bowed to Xu Liyi, speaking softly.

Xu Liyi naturally knew of his three older brothers from Luo Tian's descriptions, and he smiled in response. He felt a sense of admiration at the overwhelming power radiating from Zhang Ziping and his companions, silently sighing. Luo Tian and his three older brothers were truly rare talents of the world. At this moment, Xu Liyi especially wanted to see how powerful their master must be to have four disciples.

After a brief exchange, Luo Tian took out the Ice-Heart Jade and handed it to Lu Kunpeng. With Lu Kunpeng's alchemy skills, making the Ice-Heart Dan was no problem. After all, Lu Kunpeng was now a seven-grade alchemist.

Luo Tian was now an ordinary person. After chatting with them for a while, he felt exhausted and led Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao to the Gu family.

Upon arriving at the Gu family, they naturally had a joyous reunion, leaving Luo Tian exhausted. However, he was happy to learn that Ning Yuer had joined Tian Bo as her master and gone into seclusion in the last mountain of the Dan Pavilion, now having advanced to the Bone-Fragmenting Realm.

At night, Luo Tian lay on his bed, taking a long breath. He was somewhat unaccustomed to life as an ordinary person; no need for cultivation, just lying flat on the bed. Unconsciously, he reflected on the past few years' memories, smiling as he fell into sleep.

The next morning, Luo Tian yawned and got up, a smile on his face. He stepped outside, feeling unusually tranquil. Then he looked at the people practicing in the open space of the Gu family.

Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao, after delivering Luo Tian to the Gu family yesterday, had left the Five Elements Sect. Both were restless individuals who vowed to make a big move in the Northern Region—plundering all the sect's prodigies.

Luo Tian thought of their bold words and felt pity for the Northern Region's prodigies. Two people with such strength, even in the Southern Region, were top-tier. How much more so in the Northern Region? Luo Tian could already imagine the scenes of various sect prodigies being plundered to tears.

Walking along the main road of the Gu family, the surrounding people greeted Luo Tian with respect.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian walked, Lu Kunpeng's residence was covered by thunderclouds. Thunderous roars echoed in the sky.

"Senior Grandmaster is still restless! He's already started refining elixirs!" Luo Tian smiled, walking toward Lu Kunpeng's residence.

...

In Lu Kunpeng's alchemy room, his face bore a slight smile. Standing beside him were Zhang Ziping and Lei Yong. Their gazes also held excitement.

Lu Kunpeng had adjusted his state overnight and started refining elixirs this morning. The Ice-Heart Dan was a six-grade elixir, its effects significantly better than ordinary six-grade elixirs. However, Lu Kunpeng was now a seven-grade alchemist. After wasting two sets of ingredients and familiarizing himself with Luo Tian's formula, he had successfully refined the elixir.

A white elixir appeared in Lu Kunpeng's hand. He nodded slightly: "Good, the Ice-Heart Dan with two yuan lightning."

"Senior Grandmaster, you've already refined it so quickly!" Luo Tian's voice echoed in Lu Kunpeng's ears.

"There's no choice; this curse must be removed!" Lu Kunpeng smiled, speaking to Luo Tian who had entered.

"So let's start. I'm really weak now; if anything happens, don't blame me!" Luo Tian joked.

"Enough of the nonsense! Hurry up and do it. Remember, don't kill the curse; try to capture it alive so the elders can find clues about the Dead Corpse Sect. This past year, the Dead Corpse Sect has been too quiet!" Zhang Ziping spoke, his face showing coldness.

Chapter 577: Little Pup

Feeling the coldness in their eyes, Luo Tian's gaze darkened. He didn't know why, but a sense of danger flickered in his heart. He even wanted to recover immediately and start cultivating.

Zhang Ziping's face showed a complex expression, patting Luo Tian's shoulder lightly: "Enough. Don't overthink it. First, let's get the poison out of Senior Grandmaster!"
