In the following days, various sects kept arriving at the Five Elements Sect. Most came from the Southern Region, while the three major sects of the Eastern Region and Danzong also had their ancient elders appear at the Five Elements Sect. Even the couple Long Jian and his wife made an appearance there.

The Five Elements Sect immediately became a scene of uproar, leaving the sect's disciples groaning in despair. With so many people coming, it was truly overwhelming.

"Luotian, what do you think these old men can come up with as a plan?"

"Luotian, congratulations on becoming a ninth-grade alchemist. Will you make some ninth-grade elixirs to entertain us?"

"Yes, Luotian, hurry up and make some elixirs for us. Otherwise, we'll gang up and beat you! We've been wanting to hit you for a long time!" Some of the younger generation who were familiar with Luotian, like Chen Changsheng and the Zheng Xin brothers, led the charge. Under pressure and temptation, they forced Luotian to brew elixirs for everyone.

Although Luotian was confident, facing hundreds of thousands of talents from the three regions made it impossible for him to refuse. After memorizing those who were most vocal, he resumed his grueling elixir-making journey.

"Boom... Boom..." The deep thunderous sound kept echoing across the Five Elements Sect's square. Around it, hundreds of thousands of talents from the three regions watched with sharp eyes as if observing monkeys, watching Luotian brew elixirs.

"This boy's talent is such that, if given more time, he will surely become the next Blood Emperor!" On another side, a group of ancient elders gathered together, watching the thunderous sounds in the sky. Their faces bore expressions of quiet admiration.

The Blood Emperor nodded in satisfaction, his voice deep and aged: "Everyone, since you've all arrived roughly, let's discuss how to face the upcoming battle."

"Master Blood Emperor, whatever you need us to do, just say it. We'll follow your orders without question. Today I'm saying this: regarding the survival of the entire Tianyuan Continent, my Ice Pole Island will fully support it!" The elder from Ice Pole Island spoke coldly, his gaze fixed on the blood-red moon that was gradually taking shape in the sky.

"Yes, Master Blood Emperor, just tell us what to do!" The chorus of agreement continued. The elders from various sects wore expressions of hatred.

These people were all the talents preserved by their sects. After countless years, they had become elders of their respective sects. However, their hatred for the Tianshi Sect remained undiminished.

Chapter 710: Full Mobilization

After seven days of discussions, the sky above the Five Elements Sect shimmered with radiant light. The void kept being torn apart as various sects said their farewells to the Blood Emperor before flying back to their respective sects.

"Ah..." Luotian sighed deeply. These seven days had truly exhausted him. He hadn't stopped for a moment, continuously brewing elixirs. He wasn't sure how many eighth and ninth-grade elixirs he had made, but he knew that each one was snatched away the moment it left his hands before it had even warmed up.

"Zheng Xin! Ying Hongtu, Shangguan Hongtu, you guys just wait!" Luotian gritted his teeth, watching the many talents who had left with smiles on their faces.

These few people had been the most vocal during these days. They were the ones who had made Luotian despise them, but they had somehow managed to unite everyone. He hadn't even gotten a chance to break them one by one.

"Haha..." Gu Lei watched Luotian being taken down, laughing heartily. It was the first time in years he had seen Luotian being taken down.

"What are you laughing at? If I'm not mistaken, you were involved in organizing these people, weren't you?" Luotian's mood was bad. He heard Gu Lei's laughter and turned around, his expression dark as he vanished from the spot.

"Ah...姐夫, I'm sorry... I am your dear nephew-in-law!" In the next moment, the Five Elements Sect echoed with Gu Lei's pitiful scream.

"Stop playing around. Come to the council hall!" The Blood Emperor's voice rang in their ears, stopping Luotian and Gu Lei from playing. Their faces slightly hardened as they flashed into the council hall.

At that moment, five elders and others were already seated in the council hall. They wore expressions of respect as they gazed at the Blood Emperor sitting on the main seat.

"I have already discussed with various sects. We will use two months to enhance the strength of all sects on the Tianyuan Continent, then launch an attack in advance. If we wait until half a year is up and let the Tianshi Sect initiate the war, it would be too passive!" The Blood Emperor spoke, informing everyone of the results of their discussions.

"Furthermore, our sect's Dan殿 and Danzong from the Eastern Region will open无偿 elixir-making for all sects across the Tianyuan Continent. The medicinal herbs of various sects will also be handed over to our two sects."

"As for the preparation of elixirs and talismans, other corresponding sects will handle it. Of course, resources must also be handed over to the respective sects. Therefore, these days will be troublesome for Dan殿. All other peaks must help the Dan殿 disciples handle other matters, and the Dan殿 disciples will only be responsible for brewing elixirs!" The Blood Emperor explained briefly the seven days of discussions.

Luotian and others naturally did not object. They nodded in agreement before returning to their respective peaks to busy themselves with the tasks assigned by the Blood Emperor.

In an instant, the entire Tianyuan Continent fell into a state of preparation for war. Even the previously inactive transmission arrays in the Eastern Region were activated.

The Blood Emperor personally took action, setting up two more transmission arrays to connect with the other two regions to facilitate communication between sects.

The entire Tianyuan Continent was tense. At the same time, the strength of various sects also soared dramatically. Every day, disciples from various sects were promoted in rank. The entire Tianyuan Continent was plunged into a storm of thunder.

In the Western Region, toxic gas filled the air. Yang Huanyu sat in a dark hall, his face showing mockery as he whispered softly: "Still want to take the initiative? That's just seeking death!"

"Awaken my subordinates who have been dormant for countless years!" Yang Huanyu's hands moved rapidly, his forehead split open. A red blood mist surged into the sky, tearing through space.

As he spoke, a layer of red veil seemed to cover the surrounding area of the blood-red moon in the sky.

In an instant, the entire Tianyuan Continent was enveloped by red light.

"Ahh..." In Beichang County of the Eastern Region, where the Blood Emperor had once appeared, red light filled the area. A terrifying aura emerged from the seal, accompanied by low growls coming from beneath the ground. The earth cracked open, and rivers of blood flowed out.

"Blood Emperor! Return!" Deep red blood transformed into a middle-aged man's form, appearing in Beichang County.

"Haha. A fragment of my power was destroyed by you all. Now, with my true self summoned again, I will surely drench the entire Tianyuan Continent in blood and enter the Longsheng界!" The red figure transformed into a streak of red light, rushing into the void.

At the same time, in every seemingly insignificant corner across the Tianyuan Continent, red light kept appearing. Terrifying auras emerged from underground, similar to the Blood Emperor, tearing through space and vanishing in place.

In Ice Pole Island's Dian'an Forest, deep within Jifeng Valley, Zhang Daotian's three sub-bodies suddenly opened their eyes, emitting intense light.

"Is it time to begin? I've been preparing for so long. Today, let's erupt!" The three sub-bodies' front appeared a massive array. Zhang Daotian's hands moved rapidly, emitting powerful fluctuations. He pressed his hands down onto the ground.

"Buzz..." Three-color light pillars shot up from the depths of three dangerous regions, transforming into three long rainbows that converged towards the center of the Tianyuan Continent, where the four regions met.

"Today is the day my disciple Luotian becomes a界尊!" Zhang Daotian's face showed a slight smile as he gazed at the three light pillars gradually converging.

The people of the entire Tianyuan Continent were drawn to these three-color light pillars. The three rainbows seemed like bridges connecting heaven and earth.

One hour... two hours... time slowly passed. After three hours, the three rainbows finally merged completely into a massive ball of light, resembling a blazing sun. It illuminated the Tianyuan Continent, which was already in darkness, as if it were daytime.

What frightened people was that the ball of light kept shrinking and its color gradually darkened. However, the fluctuations it emitted became even more terrifying. Even Luotian, who had grasped a fragment of chaos power, felt fear when he saw the gradually darkening ball.

"What is this thing!" Luotian's eyes showed confusion as he watched the gradually compressed, gray ball of light.

"Primordial Chaos Power! Such terrifying Primordial Chaos Power! It's completely capable of forging a界尊!" The Blood Emperor's eyes showed excitement as he gazed at the object that had turned into a gray sphere.

"Go!" Zhang Daotian's three sub-bodies pointed their fingers, and the gray sphere transformed into a streak of light, rapidly flying towards the Five Elements Sect.

"It's coming this way!"

"Who is this great immortal? How could he have such strength to condense such terrifying Primordial Chaos Power!" The people of the Northern Region showed excitement, with many elders rising to try and intercept the gray sphere.

But the sphere's speed was too fast. Even these elders couldn't match its pace.

Chapter 711: On the Verge of Becoming a界尊

The gray streak of light pierced through space, heading toward the Five Elements Sect. The Blood Emperor's face showed a hint of joy as he gazed into the distance, his expression deepening.

Countless strong warriors flew into the sky to intercept the sphere of Primordial Chaos Power, but they all showed expressions of disappointment.

"Five Elements Sect! The sphere has arrived at the Five Elements Sect. Is it made by the Blood Emperor?" The entire Northern Region was shaken. The appearance of the chaos sphere was enough to stir anyone's heart. If the Five Elements Sect didn't have the Blood Emperor stationed there, it would definitely be besieged by people.

"Don't come closer!" Luotian's face showed trembling as he watched the gray chaos sphere. He silently called out, knowing it was a great opportunity but unable to withstand its speed.

"Hmm? Luotian, I feel like it's coming this way!" Gu Lei showed a hint of excitement on his face as he watched the chaos sphere穿梭 through space.

"Damn!" Gu Lei's words had barely finished when Luotian cursed. The gray chaos sphere, under the astonished gaze of the Five Elements Sect's disciples, directly flew onto Luotian's head.

"Buzz..." Instead of the brain splattering he had imagined, it felt surprisingly comfortable. The gray sphere quickly flew into Luotian's mind sea.

Gray mist spread, turning Luotian's originally golden mind sea into a gray one. He felt as if he had entered an unusual state, his entire being unusually clear and unified with heaven and earth.

"Don't disturb him!" The Blood Emperor's voice echoed. His thin body appeared before Gu Lei and others, his golden eyes flashing with intensity as if he could see through Luotian. He then showed a hint of hope.

"Respect the Blood Emperor!" Gu Lei and others showed reverence, bowing to the Blood Emperor.

"This boy's master has given him a great opportunity. If successful, this boy will leap over the dragon and become a界尊, even higher!" The Blood Emperor spoke, his voice carrying an aged tone.

Hearing the Blood Emperor's explanation word by word, Gu Lei and others showed expressions of shock. A界尊 was a level that most people wouldn't even dare to imagine. Yet, this young Luotian had the potential to achieve it. How could they not be astonished?

After these days of elixirs, Gu Lei and others had also reached the peak of凝聚魂. With the chaos true roe elixir, they would soon become strong warriors who had grasped a fragment of chaos power. However, the idea of a界尊 was something they had never dared to dream of.

So far, only the Blood Emperor had achieved a界尊. Although there were legends of others achieving it, those people either disappeared or attained enlightenment.

"Wait, Blood Emperor, you said there might be something higher! What does that mean? Is there a level above界尊?" Tian Luo's eyes widened, his expression filled with disbelief as he exclaimed, gazing at the Blood Emperor.

"That's something you'll understand when you reach the界尊 level. If you don't, even if I told you, you wouldn't understand!" The Blood Emperor shook his head gently. He waved his hand, creating an invisible barrier to enclose Luotian.

"Alright, go do your own things!" The Blood Emperor spoke, driving everyone away. He vanished from the spot.

Seeing the Blood Emperor disappear, Gu Lei and Tian Luo showed expressions of disappointment. They left Luotian's small courtyard and returned to their respective places for cultivation.

In the following month, the strength of the entire Tianyuan Continent rapidly increased. For example, the Five Elements Sect alone had hundreds of people at the peak of凝聚魂. And those who had grasped a fragment of chaos power among them reached thirty, an astonishing number.

Such terrifying strength directly made other major sects stunned. It was frightening. When the Five Elements Sect was at its most prosperous, it had only had around a dozen warriors who had grasped a fragment of chaos power. Now it was doubled.

Other sects' strength also greatly improved. The younger generation had all grown up, and the sect's strength became the strongest in history.

However, the following day, the entire Tianyuan Continent was unusually quiet. It became completely silent, a heavy atmosphere flowing across the continent like the calm before a storm.

Ordinary people and low-level hermits seemed to sense something unusual. The blood-red moon in the sky became even more sinister, as if a crimson eye was greedily watching over the people of the Tianyuan Continent.

That day, all sects seemed to have prearranged it. Each sect gathered at their respective places, waiting for the elders' orders.

At the Five Elements Sect, millions of disciples showed excited expressions as they watched the Blood Emperor standing like a war god in the sky, waiting for his speech.

"Everyone, disciples of the Five Elements Sect. The Tianshi Sect once caused chaos across the entire Tianyuan Continent, and now it has returned with even greater strength. This battle concerns the survival of the entire Tianyuan Continent, your family, relatives, lovers, and friends! Therefore, we can only fight with all our might without retreating!"

"I have already discussed with the elders of major sects. We will strike first and eliminate this evil force!" The Blood Emperor stood in the sky, speaking clearly.

The situation was similar for other sects. All elders explained the severity of the facts to their disciples.

"Kill!" A terrifying killing intent formed among the Five Elements Sect's disciples, rising to the heavens. Cold voices and invisible waves spread through the millions of disciples.

"Go on, my children!" The Blood Emperor spoke. The Five Elements Sect's disciples immediately roared and rushed out, with dozens of dragons flying from above the Five Elements Sect. These dragons were from Dian'an Forest, specially sent to carry disciples of the炼体 and 化骨 levels.

These disciples were not very useful, mainly relying on those at the凝聚魂 level. However, considering that if the battle failed, the entire Tianyuan Continent would be lost, they decided to take them all along. After all, every level of cultivation was a fraction of power. The elders of the sects understood the saying that many ants could bite down an elephant.

On this day, the sky above the Tianyuan Continent was filled with flowing lights. Disciples from various sects flew toward one place, the Western Region now regarded as a forbidden area.

The Five Elements Sect's disciples took an entire day to completely leave the sect. At this point, only a few祭魄 and 元灵 level warriors remained in the Five Elements Sect, along with some ordinary people without cultivation.

The Blood Emperor stood in the sky, his face complex as he gazed at the small courtyard of the Dan殿: "I hope you become a界尊. Now, it's better to be in seclusion. After all, the main purpose of these people is your纪元 book in your mind sea!"

Chapter 712: The Battle Begins

The Blood Emperor showed a hint of joy, his hands moving rapidly. A dragon staff appeared in his hand. His hands moved slightly, and a series of golden lights transformed into strange symbols, surrounding the entire Five Elements Sect with a golden barrier.

After completing these actions, the Blood Emperor's face turned cold and vanished into the world.

At this moment, Luotian was unaware of anything happening outside. His face showed calm and peace, as if his soul had wandered into another world. His golden mind sea had completely turned gray.

In his golden mind sea, Luotian felt like the master of the entire world. A gray soul appeared, and with a wave of his hand, rows of gray buildings emerged in Luotian's mind sea. They instantly shattered and turned back into mist.

Luotian felt as if he had become the creator of all things. Whether living or non-living, everything appeared with each wave of his hand.

What shocked the remaining disciples of the Five Elements Sect was that at this moment, all the plants on the vast mountain of the Five Elements Sect were growing rapidly. The buildings on the Five Elements Mountain also seemed to self-repair, everything appearing brand new.

Luotian was completely immersed in creating this world.

...

On the other side, outside the toxic barrier of the Western Region, a group of figures appeared around the Western Region. A crowd of hundreds of thousands surrounded the vast Western Region.

But no one dared to act recklessly, as the thick toxic barrier seemed like a natural obstacle, isolating people. The terrifying poison gas made people fear it.

The Eastern, Western, and Northern Regions formed three groups of forces, surrounding the Western Region from three directions, almost completely enclosing it.

"Buzz..." A fluctuation of energy spread. The elders of the Five Elements Sect and the Blood Emperor appeared in people's sight.

"Greetings, Blood Emperor!" The Northern Region's people bowed respectfully, their faces showing reverence.

"Blood Emperor, this toxic barrier isolates us. What should we do?" The elder of Jinglei Sect spoke with lightning flashing on his body. With the increase in strength, he had become a half-step界尊.

The Blood Emperor's brow slightly furrowed. Seeing the thick toxic gas, even a祭魄 level warrior entering would be risky. How much more so for those at the 元灵 and 化骨 levels.

"Yang Huanyu! Old friend, you don't come out to welcome me?" The Blood Emperor spoke coldly. He swung his staff, and a golden staff shadow surged into the toxic barrier.

The golden staff shadow instantly appeared within the toxic barrier, in the central area of the Western Region. It was over the palace of the Tianshi Sect.

"Crack!" A thunderous sound echoed. The nine-level array's barrier instantly shattered, and the entire black palace swayed three times.

"Have you come? Although it was a bit hasty, it doesn't matter!" Yang Huanyu's face showed coldness. His mouth slightly curled.

"Blood Emperor, you were severely injured by me before and have been surviving until now. Now that you've become a界尊, do you dare to be arrogant before me? Or do you think that these废物 outside can destroy my Tianshi Sect?" Yang Huanyu's body shimmered, instantly vanishing from the palace. In the next moment, a massive phantom stood towering in the sky.

"Yang Huanyu!" The elders of the Five Elements Sect showed expressions of disbelief upon seeing the massive phantom in the sky.

Yang Huanyu was once a genius who had entered the Five Elements Sect at the same time as Luotian. The disciples of the Five Elements Sect naturally recognized him. Since they learned that Yang Huanyu was from the Tianshi Sect, they had begun to hate him. However, after that battle, Yang Huanyu disappeared from the sight of the Five Elements Sect disciples. People never dared to connect this young Yang Huanyu with the Tianshi Sect's elder.

"Haha, Blood Emperor, I never expected you to be so young now. And you've grown old! Now what do you have to fight me with?" Yang Huanyu's phantom showed mockery, gazing at the direction of the Blood Emperor.

"Then say, with me, is it enough?" A deep voice echoed in people's ears. The figure of Zhang Daotian appeared, his appearance showing a sense of ancient grace and hatred.

"Zhang Daotian? The former failure, the dog of a family! Now that you've become a界尊, dare to be arrogant!" Yang Huanyu's face showed no fear at all. He gazed at Zhang Daotian emerging from the void.

"Zhang Daotian! The head of Dan殿!" Seeing Zhang Daotian's figure, the disciples of the Five Elements Sect showed excitement. They never expected that the head of Dan殿 was also a界尊.

"One more, come out. Don't hide anymore!" Yang Huanyu's eyes showed a serious expression. His gaze seemed to penetrate everything, looking into the void.

"Haha, Elder Yang Huanyu, your eyes are truly sharp!" The void ruptured. A long laugh echoed. The old man's appearance caused a tremor in the Ice Pole Island.

"Greetings, Ice Ancestor!" Lo Nan Tian had returned these days. His face showed reverence as he gazed at the old man emerging from the void.

"An extraordinary person, Yin Tianxiong! I never expected you to come too!" Yang Huanyu's eyes finally showed a hint of fear as he gazed at Yin Tianxiong.

"Old friend, I never expected your reincarnation to reach the界尊 level so quickly. Your talent truly makes me admire!" Yin Tianxiong stood on the void, his voice falling like a cold wind towards the toxic barrier.

"Dad, Yin Tianxiong is our Ice Pole Island's elder?" Lo Nan Tian showed amazement, gazing at Yin Tianxiong in the sky. He never expected that Yin Tianxiong had such a status.

"Three界尊, but you are all old. Your blood is weak. How can you compare to me? After reincarnation, even if you three are not my opponents!" Yang Huanyu's face showed a hint of joy. His voice echoed into everyone's ears.

"Arrogant! A little boy who hasn't even grown hair yet dares to defeat our elders!" The disciples outside the toxic barrier, seeing Yang Huanyu's arrogance, couldn't help but curse.

"Can you do it? Just try!" Zhang Daotian spoke. He exchanged a glance with the Blood Emperor and Yin Tianxiong. The three of them instantly appeared in three positions. Their bodies emitted invisible fluctuations, surrounding the Western Region.

"Now is not the time. Wait a bit. You should first play with these toxic insects and the toxic barrier!" Yang Huanyu's face showed a hint of joy.

At the same time, countless warriors from the Tianshi Sect in the Western Region emitted a series of insect cries. A large number of insects appeared in the sight of Tianyuan Continent's cultivators.

Chapter 713: Bone Skulls

After Yang Huanyu's words, countless insects flew up and formed a black storm, covering the sky. They rushed toward the people of the Tianyuan Continent.

"Child, lend me three thousand flaming fires!" Zhang Daotian showed a hint of disdain. He extended his hand, and a red flame flew out from Dan Yan's body.

"Go!" Zhang Daotian pointed his finger. A green mist and gray mist flew out from Zhang Daotian's hands. In an instant, flames roared. The three thousand flaming fires that flew out from Dan Yan's body instantly expanded into a vast sea of fire, rushing toward the storm of insects.

The sound of phoenix cries echoed. Without needing the Blood Emperor, Zhang Daotian, or Yin Tianxiong's reminders, Meng Yao's black flames surged into the sky. They merged with the three thousand flaming fires to form a storm, rushing toward the insect swarm.

"Fire..." Two elders from Danzong showed cold expressions. They both summoned their ancestral flames, rushing toward the insect swarm and toxic barrier.

"Destroy these things!" Zhang Qiu Yue's face showed endless coldness. Her white flames surged out.

Four-color flames formed a colorful sea of fire and insect swarm in the sky over the Western Region. A thick smoke appeared, making the already dark sky even more hazy.

"Let's also deal with this toxic barrier!" Zhang Daotian, the Blood Emperor, and Yin Tianxiong exchanged glances. They nodded, their hands moving rapidly. A powerful suction emerged from their hands, drawing endless toxic gas into their hands.

"Hmph! Foolish. The toxic barrier of the Western Region is endless, a gift from heaven and earth to the Western Region. Do you really think that reaching the界尊 level can draw this toxic barrier away?" In the black palace, Yang Huanyu stood with thousands of disciples at the peak of凝聚魂. His face showed disdain.

"Master, let us go out and destroy them all! These three界尊 may be hard to deal with, but others are just strong ants. They're perfect for refining the纪元 book and enhancing your strength. Then, I'm sure no one in the entire Tianyuan Continent will be a match for you!" A grim-faced elder showed reverence on his face.

"Your group has just emerged from the seal. Your current strength is not at your peak. This toxic barrier, for these three old men, although it will take some time, it's not difficult!"

"Remember, the界尊 level is not as simple as you think! Your main goal now is to recover your strength. When they have completely absorbed the toxic barrier, that's when you'll make your move!" Yang Huanyu's face showed no emotion. He spoke to his subordinates.

Yang Huanyu waved his hand, and a series of blood-red pearls appeared in the hall, piled up like mountains.

"These are the soul-forging pearls I've been carefully cultivating for years with the Tianshi Sect. They are enough to restore you to your peak!" Yang Huanyu spoke, seemingly indifferent, gazing into the distance.

"Thank you, Master!" The thousands of black-cloaked people in the hall showed excitement on their faces, gazing at the mountain of soul-forging pearls.

"Ah! How many people must have been killed to get so many soul-forging pearls? It's been a long time since I tasted the flavor of blood. How nostalgic it is!" The thousands of strong warriors showed a hint of greed on their faces.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." The blood-red soul-forging pearls exploded like firecrackers, turning into a mass of blood mist that filled the entire hall.

Like actual liquid droplets, the red liquid formed a massive array. The thousands of strong warriors showed a hint of ecstasy as they sat in the array, continuously refining the blood mist within it.

"I hope it succeeds. If it does, it will save me a lot of effort!" Yang Huanyu gazed toward the Five Elements Sect's direction, speaking softly to himself.

Zhang Daotian, the Blood Emperor, and Yin Tianxiong, three界尊 strong warriors, continuously gathered purple toxic gas before them. The toxic barrier over the Western Region gradually thinned under their terrifying extraction, becoming less dense. Even those at the level of 元灵 could now see the scenery inside.

"This is still the Western Region?" The elders at the peak of凝聚魂 who had grasped a fragment of chaos power showed sighs as they gazed at the Western Region, now hidden by the toxic barrier.

Their view revealed a barren land with no living creatures. Purple light filled everywhere, and bones were scattered everywhere without any life.

"Damn it! These people have wiped out all the life in the Western Region!" Long Jian and other great immortals showed anger on their faces. The area of the Western Region was so vast, yet it had been completely wiped out.

Feeling the elders' anger, the disciples of various sects on the Tianyuan Continent also realized something. They all showed cold expressions, gazing at the vague outline of a massive palace located in the center of the Western Region.

"Kill!" Someone shouted, sparking the anger within everyone. The disciples from three regions showed killing intent and rushed toward the toxic barrier.

Now that the three界尊 had extracted the toxic barrier, it no longer posed any threat to those at the level of 元灵 and above.

Above the sky, all the disciples from three regions who had reached the level of 元ling and 祭魄 showed anger. There were hundreds of thousands of them, forming a colorful river that rushed toward the vague massive palace.

Gathering all disciples from three regions who had reached the level of 元灵 and above, their momentum was overwhelming. Their fierce energy caused large areas of ground to tremble as they rushed toward the black palace, emitting a series of thunderous sounds.

"Although I expected it to be faster, it's still useless!" Yang Huanyu moved his hands again and pressed down on the ground. A fluctuation spread.

"Crack..." Under people's astonished gaze, white bones on the ground slowly stood up. They kept assembling into a human-like form and gradually rose, their skull heads showing green flames in the eyes.

"Ten... ten thousand... one hundred thousand..." Millions of bones rose from the ground. After them, energy flowed gently. Invisible wings fluttered and flew into the sky, intercepted by the disciples from three regions.

"Disciples at the level of 元灵 and 化骨 must eliminate these bones. Disciples at the level of 祭魄 and 凝魂 should preserve their strength and not act recklessly!" The voices of the three界尊 echoed in people's ears, causing those rushing to pause slightly.

"One million against several millions?" The billions of炼体 disciples outside the toxic barrier showed expressions of shock.

Chapter 714: Yang Huanyu's Intentions

"How can we fight? Although these bones seem to be at the level of 元灵, they are much weaker than regular 元灵 disciples. Your strength is enough to eliminate them!" Zhang Daotian's voice echoed, his face also showing a heart-wrenching expression. The only person remaining from the Xianggu Continent was Zhang Daotian. Seeing the bones of people from the Xianggu Continent being used, it was impossible for Zhang Daotian not to feel heart-wrenching.

"Kill!" Disciples from the Tianyuan Continent at the level of 元灵 and 化骨 showed killing intent. Now that it was this far, there was only one path: to kill and completely eliminate the tumor on the Tianyuan Continent.

"Haha, do you really think these bone armies are so easy to eliminate? It doesn't matter. Let them last as long as they can!" Yang Huanyu sat in the palace, his face showing a cold smile.

In an instant, the sky over the Western Region was filled with dazzling martial arts. The people of the Tianyuan Continent shouted and rushed toward the white bones, with many dying and white bones turning into powder floating in the air.

But ultimately, it was still the side of the Tianyuan Continent that suffered more. After all, they were losing real people while the Tianshi Sect had almost no losses.

...

In the Northern Region, at the Five Elements Sect, Luotian still sat in meditation. His face showed peace and serenity. A golden barrier appeared around him, almost isolating him from the outside world.

The remaining tens of thousands of disciples at the Five Elements Sect showed respectful expressions as they gazed at Luotian in golden light. They instinctively surrounded him, waiting for his awakening.

However, soon after, people felt a sudden sense of crisis. This feeling was very abrupt, although the sky was clear and bright, people felt as if they were being watched by something.

"Buzz..." The void split open. A withered figure appeared in people's sight, causing their gazes to show caution.

"Who are you?" The disciples of the Five Elements Sect spoke loudly, surrounding Luotian tightly. Their eyes were serious as they gazed at the old figure in the sky.

"Haha, who I am doesn't matter. But you won't know who you are next!" The old man, looking like a corpse, spoke. His eyes flashed red light, seemingly not seeing the disciples of the Five Elements Sect. His eyes were fixed on Luotian.

"Everyone, protect Luotian!" A disciple at the level of 祭魄 spoke with a determined expression. He activated the Five Elements Sect's protective array and, at the same time, thousands of people's bodies glowed with light. They gathered into a barrier, enclosing Luotian.

"Haha, ants are still ants!" The old man spoke lightly. His withered hand slowly lifted and pointed toward the Five Elements Mountain.

But this seemingly light-handed strike carried overwhelming power. A massive hand of energy covered the entire sky, rubbing against the air and rushing toward the Five Elements Mountain.
