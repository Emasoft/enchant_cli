Bending the bow, the black magic arrow shot forth from Luo Tian's hand, piercing through the starry sky and breaking through the fluctuating waves of the Seven Demon Blades and the Yin-Yang Convergence Seal. In an instant, it appeared before the Yin-Yang Holy Son, marking Luo Tian's ultimate killing technique.

"Damn it, I almost forgot the bow on his back!" The Yin-Yang Holy Son's heart trembled with shock, a sense of peril instantly seizing both their minds.

"It's the Wounding Heaven Bow! Luo Tian once used this to slay a late-stage Sage with his early-stage Sage power!" The crowd panicked. The Wounding Heaven Bow was a sacred treasure of the Divine Realm, and these people could not possibly be unfamiliar with it.

Long ago, when the divine realm's old Divine King reached his Sage peak, he used this bow to slay three late-stage Sage masters, earning the divine realm's Divine King an undefeated reputation.

"Master Holy Son, hold firm!" Two elders of the Yin-Yang Sect exchanged glances, their hands moving swiftly. Eighty-one banners flared with power, and the refining force transformed into serpents of energy rushing toward Luo Tian.

"Block it!" The Yin-Yang Holy Son bellowed, and a Taiji pattern instantly formed before him, rotating slowly to block the magic arrow's path.

"Crack..." The black magic arrow collided with the Taiji pattern in an instant, and the pattern shattered violently, scattering into white and black holy energy around the Yin-Yang Holy Son.

The attack did not wane; the interwoven Taiji pattern merely delayed the magic arrow for a moment, reducing its power by a third. The arrow then pierced into the Yin-Yang Holy Son's body.

The ultimate destructive force caused the Yin-Yang Holy Son to spit blood profusely, pinning him into the starry sky.

"Damn you, little brat!" The Yin-Yang elders' faces darkened. They could sense the Holy Son's current weakness. These two were the sect's hope, rare individuals who had mastered the Yin-Yang Death Curse. They could not afford to lose him; even if they died, they must protect the Holy Son.

The two elders went into a frenzy, their hands pressing toward the stars. The refining force surged toward Luo Tian, intending to smother him alive.

"Is he still alive?" Luo Tian's feet danced the幽冥鬼步, his speed surging beneath him. Even the refining force missed its mark.

In an instant, Luo Tian appeared before the Yin-Yang Holy Son, like a specter emerging from hell. The Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist swung again, striking the weakened Yin-Yang Holy Son.

"Open up!" Luo Tian laughed aloud, his movements elusive; the serpents of refining force could not catch his pace.

The black fist, imbued with the Great Dao and the梵天攻杀大术, struck the severely weakened Yin-Yang Holy Son.

The thunderous impact echoed as the Yin-Yang Holy Son staggered backward under the astonished gazes of the crowd. As he retreated, two figures suddenly separated. Their faces were pale to the point of whiteness, and fine cracks spread across their bodies, as if a single touch could shatter them completely.

"Come!" The two elders of the Yin-Yang Sect went into a frenzy, their bodies flickering. They instantly appeared before the two Holy Sons, and white and black holy energy surged into their bodies.

"No use!" Luo Tian materialized like a phantom before Yin Zilin Yin Ming, and the Great Dao Fist struck again.

"Boom..." The weakened Yin Ming could not withstand Luo Tian's attack. Even the late-stage Sage elder who had been desperately healing him was too slow to react, as Luo Tian's speed was unparalleled.

Under the stunned gazes of the crowd, Yin Ming transformed into a mist of blood and vanished from sight without any sign of regenerating.

"What's going on? Is Yin Ming really dead?" The crowd stared at the blood mist scattered across the stars, their faces trembling.

"Hmm?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly. According to his guess, Yin Ming should have died under this punch; the Great Dao would have completely consumed his soul.

Yet, for some reason, Luo Tian felt an inexplicable sense that Yin Ming was still alive. It was a premonition with no rational basis.

"Buzz..." As the crowd marveled, a strange vibration emanated from the bloodied flesh. It transformed into a crimson seal, which then shattered. Yin Ming's figure reappeared before the crowd.

"The Yin-Yang Sect's Immortality Seal, a miraculous seal that allows one to die once. I didn't expect the Yin-Yang Sect to value these two Holy Sons so highly, granting them such a seal!" The crowd gasped in disbelief, watching Yin Ming reappear before them, his face pale.

On the other side, Yang Zilin Yang Quan gradually recovered, his complexion still pale but with the cracks on his body vanishing.

"Kid, you're dead! You're going to die!" The four elders of the Yin-Yang Sect went completely mad, their bodies radiating black and white holy energy. They poured it into the eighty-one banners.

Chapter 1060: The Lifting Sky Melody

Beyond the Divine Beast Ancient Cave, four elders of the Yin-Yang Sect wore wild expressions. Their hands moved, and black and white holy energy surged skyward into the eighty-one banners.

"Die!" They all spoke in unison, and the banners flapped wildly, emitting terrifying waves.

"Buzz..." The black and white holy energy, amplified by the banners, radiated terrifying power. Black and white qi filled a hundred miles around, enveloping Luo Tian entirely.

"Refine him!" Two elders of the Yin-Yang Sect spoke, and within the banners, holy seas churned. The black and white qi collided, forming a massive Taiji pattern from afar. Yin-Yang clashed, two ultimate refining forces. Even if Luo Tian's speed was fast, he could not escape.

"Epoch Bell!" Luo Tian's face changed; after merely a brief contact, his holy energy ocean boiled. He quickly used the Epoch Bell to protect himself.

"Kid, the Taiji pattern changes endlessly. Though you've grasped some of the Great Dao's power, you'll still be refined to death in front of true Great Dao power!" The Yin-Yang Holy Son spoke, his voice laced with hatred. Today they had been suppressed by Luo Tian, losing face. If it weren't for the Yin-Yang Immortality Seal, Yin Ming would already be dead. Thus, they despised Luo Tian deeply.

"Luo Tian is done! That was the flag that could refine five late-stage Sages!" The crowd murmured, watching Luo Tian trapped within the Taiji pattern.

Luo Tian's expression also slightly changed as he gazed at the four elders of the Yin-Yang Sect, their faces filled with smugness.

Trapped within the Taiji pattern, Luo Tian was protected by the Epoch Bell but could feel the ultimate refining force. The black and white holy energy continuously collided with the bell's dome, causing it to emit a continuous humming sound. Even through the Epoch Bell, Luo Tian felt unbearable discomfort.

"Hmm?" Soon after, he discovered a terrifying truth: the Epoch Bell seemed to no longer obey him. The terrifying refining force was gradually refining the imprint he had left within it.

"Kid, do you feel anything? No matter what treasures you have, they'll all be erased before this ultimate refining force. Your treasures will eventually fall into our hands!" The four elders of the Yin-Yang Sect laughed maniacally.

"Trouble," Luo Tian furrowed his brows, never expecting them to have such a method. He sat cross-legged within the Epoch Bell, thinking of ways to counteract the situation.

Time passed slowly; the Epoch Bell's light dimmed further. Luo Tian could feel it gradually slipping from his control, about to become a lifeless object.

"Did I have to use the Ancient Palace of the Far Past?" Luo Tian's brows furrowed deeply, watching the dense crowd around him. He did not want to unleash the Ancient Palace of the Far Past.

"Haha, kid, when your fake Epoch Treasure no longer protects you, that's your death!" The four elders of the Yin-Yang Sect stood under the stars, their eyes filled with excitement. Two fake Epoch Treasures—any sect would be tempted.

The Yin-Yang Sect was a major sect of the Divine Beast Realm, and fake Epoch Treasures were also precious. Even during this exploration of the Divine Beast Ancient Cave, they had only taken out one fake Epoch Treasure for escape.

Luo Tian's Wounding Heaven Bow and the Epoch Bell—one was for offense, one for defense. If they fell into the Yin-Yang Holy Son's hands, they would be a perfect match, greatly boosting his power. He could enter the Yin-Yang Death Curse state again, giving him a chance to fight even late-stage Sages and escape with the means to survive.

"Everyone, you seem to have forgotten me!" As Luo Tian was desperately anxious and the Yin-Yang Sect's people were excitedly waiting for him to be refined, a calm voice echoed through the stars.

His white robe was as snow-white, his black hair flowing without wind. A transcendent aura rose in the starry sky. Jiang Nanxuan stood a few steps away, his face still carrying a faint smile, holding a golden array banner in his hand.

"Hmm?" The four elders of the Yin-Yang Sect furrowed their brows slightly, gazing at Jiang Nanxuan. Upon seeing his cultivation was only early-stage Sage, they wore mocking expressions.

Jiang Nanxuan stood beside Luo Tian. One early-stage Sage against four—none took Jiang Nanxuan seriously, for a single early-stage Sage could be easily killed.

Luo Tian was trapped within the Taiji pattern, hearing that calm voice. A smile appeared on his face; he knew if Jiang Nanxuan had stepped forward, he must have had some confidence.

"A mere early-stage Sage dares to be arrogant before us! I'll kill him!" Lin Yangquan's face darkened. Though his current condition was not good, and his holy energy had been largely consumed, he still believed a single early-stage Sage could be killed.

Jiang Nanxuan remained calm, always maintaining his elegant demeanor. This aura was not faked but innate. He extended his hand, tossing the banner into the stars. At the same time, three array banners appeared in his hands. Before Lin Yangquan arrived, he swiftly cast them into the stars.

Jiang Nanxuan's hands formed a seal, and golden holy energy was infused into the four array banners. A wave of power spread out. At the same time, the entire starry sky trembled as the array banners surrounded the Yin-Yang Sect's eighty-one banners.

"Wind!" Jiang Nanxuan extended his hand, and a fierce wind arose. A terrifying storm suddenly formed in the starry sky, causing people to gasp in astonishment.

"Lin!" Ignoring the crowd's amazement, Jiang Nanxuan pointed his finger again. A surge of vitality formed, manifesting as a green storm.

"Fire, Mountain!" Jiang Nanxuan pointed his finger again. Infernal flames surged skyward, and the stars trembled. Two-color storms formed and finally converged within the array, rushing toward the Taiji pattern surrounding Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." The four-color storms instantly surrounded the Taiji pattern, and it seemed to have encountered a natural enemy. Under the four-color storms' pressure, it was continuously devoured.

"Damn!" As the array formed, Lin Yangquan arrived before Jiang Nanxuan instantly. His divine power surged skyward. Without hesitation, he punched toward Jiang Nanxuan.

"Though I'm not a genius like Luo Tian, you're still no match for me now that you're wounded!" Jiang Nanxuan's eyes showed a faint smile. His calmness revealed immense confidence.

A green sword appeared in his hand, emitting a continuous humming sound. It slashed toward Lin Yangquan. Though the strike seemed ordinary, it carried an immense sword intent.

"Die!" Seeing Jiang Nanxuan not dodging but attacking him, Lin Yangquan sneered.

"Crack..." The green sword collided with Lin Yangquan's fist. In the next moment, the green sword twisted violently and gradually bent under Jiang Nanxuan's gaze.

Both men retreated. Lin Yangquan's eyes slightly narrowed, noticing a one-inch deep wound on his fist. His gaze toward Jiang Nanxuan changed.

"Indeed, a mid-stage Sage. Even wounded, you can still block my attack!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, sheathing his sword. He knew this sword alone could not kill Lin Yangquan in the short term.

"What tricks do you have? In front of absolute power, all methods are just empty clouds!" Lin Yangquan transformed into a golden sun and rushed toward Jiang Nanxuan again.

Jiang Nanxuan's lips curled upward. He waved his hand, sat cross-legged under the stars, and a purple bamboo zither appeared before him. He lightly plucked the strings.

"Ascending Sky Melody, one melody to sever the sky!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, plucking the zither strings. A clear sound of music rose in the starry sky.

The Dao's voice spread, and a powerful pressure arose throughout the starry sky. Lin Yangquan's body, like a blazing sun, suddenly halted. The seemingly serene zither music concealed an immense killing intent.

As Lin Yangquan was stunned, invisible waves instantly swept over his body, causing pain to spread across him. His body formed numerous wounds.

The music continued; the killing intent filled the sky, and waves of power surged. In this beautiful zither melody, Lin Yangquan's body continuously formed wounds. In an instant, he became a bloodied figure.

The crowd was shocked watching Jiang Nanxuan. They never expected this calm man to possess such a terrifying method. Like Luo Tian, he had also grasped the Great Dao's power. However, while Luo Tian used it in his fists with wild destruction, Jiang Nanxuan had embedded the Great Dao's power within his zither music, concealing endless killing intent.

Jiang Nanxuan's hands moved continuously; the zither music alternated between light and heavy. The Great Dao's power spread like waves across the starry sky. In an instant, Lin Yangquan was completely eradicated by the zither music, transforming into a mist of blood and forming a crimson seal.

"Another Yin-Yang Immortality Seal!" The crowd's faces showed shock as they gazed at Jiang Nanxuan. If it weren't for the Yin-Yang Immortality Seal, Lin Yangquan would already be dead.

Yet even so, the crowd did not believe in Lin Yangquan's survival, for Jiang Nanxuan's zither music had not yet ceased. That crimson seal would still be eradicated by the zither music if it formed a human shape.

"Kill!" The remaining three elders of the Yin-Yang Sect's faces turned dark. They never expected Luo Tian's small companion to be so troublesome.

Lin Yangquan, under the crowd's gaze, gradually formed a human shape. At the same time, Lin Yiming and two late-stage Sage elders rushed toward Lin Yangquan's side. A terrifying pressure instantly enveloped Jiang Nanxuan.

"Spit!" Jiang Nanxuan coughed up blood, the zither music ceased. His hands rested on the zither strings, his face still calm.

"Kid, you're at death's door, yet you can still smile!" Lin Yiming scolded, seeing Jiang Nanxuan's demeanor.

"You! You seem to have forgotten someone!" Jiang Nanxuan extended his hand, pointing at the four's backs. He then retrieved the purple bamboo zither.

Chapter 1061: The Grave Robber

Under the stars, Jiang Nanxuan coughed up blood. His face bore a smile as he rested his hands on the front of the purple zither, gazing at the four elders of the Yin-Yang Sect before him.

"Kid, you're at death's door, yet you can still smile!" Two of the Yin-Yang Sect elders' faces darkened. They gazed at Jiang Nanxuan, who remained calm.

The Yin-Yang Sect had suffered heavy losses. The consumption of two Yin-Yang Immortality Seals was no small cost, even for the sect. They had already spent them entirely on Luo Tian and his companion before entering the Divine Beast Ancient Cave. That was equivalent to losing a life.

"You seem to have forgotten someone!" Jiang Nanxuan stood still, extending his hand toward the four's backs.

"Boom..." As Jiang Nanxuan's words fell, the four felt a shocking aura instantly transmitting into their minds.

"Damn! Luo Tian!" Upon hearing Jiang Nanxuan's words, the four's minds trembled. Previously, when Lin Yangquan was in danger, they had forgotten to control the Soul-Devouring Flag. This allowed Jiang Nanxuan's array to continue eroding the Yin-Yang Dao Pattern, reducing its power by three parts.

Luo Tian's body shimmered with golden light, breaking through the Yin-Yang Dao Pattern. He reappeared before the crowd's eyes, transforming into a meteor and rushing toward the four elders of the Yin-Yang Sect.

A crisis instantly invaded the four's minds, as if a primordial beast lurked behind them, ready to tear them apart.

The four's current state was poor. Previously, the Yin-Yang Holy Son had been severely wounded by Luo Tian and was at his lowest. Later, they had assisted two late-stage Sage elders in activating the Soul-Devouring Flag. Now their holy energy had been entirely drained by the flag.

A black fist instantly appeared behind a late-stage Sage elder, and the Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist struck. It smashed into the back of that elder.

"Crack..." Under the crowd's shock, the elder transformed into a pile of flesh and blood. His blood splattered onto the other three.

"Can't do it, this kid is too strong now. We can't withstand him!" The elder slowly coalesced, his cultivation naturally dropping to mid-stage Sage. He transmitted this to the three with a mental message.

"Are we supposed to run?" The Yin-Yang Holy Son's eyes carried resentment, gazing at Luo Tian who rushed toward them again.

"Preserve the forest, don't worry about firewood. We can't go into the Divine Beast Ancient Cave now; going would mean death!" The only elder not attacked by Luo Tian spoke, his voice carrying a hint of retreat.

"Wait until you've fully mastered the Yin-Yang Death Curse and achieved perfect fusion, then seek revenge against this kid. Or ask for the help of a late-stage Sage elder to kill him. Given your status with the elders, it would be easy for them to come out!" The two elders transmitted mentally, their voices laced with urgency.

"Fine, let's go!" The two Holy Sons nodded, though they were reluctant, but ultimately valued their lives.

"Want to run?" Luo Tian watched them transmitting mentally, his gaze filled with mockery. He swung the Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist toward the white-robed elder.

"Penetrating Cloud Spear!" The white-robed elder saw Luo Tian rushing again and extended his hand. A golden spear appeared before the crowd's eyes. At this point, the Yin-Yang Sect finally used their sect's treasure—this fake Epoch Treasure.

"Go!" The four made a decision instantly, without hesitation. They leaped into the Penetrating Cloud Spear and activated their black and white holy energy.

"Buzz..." The spear emitted a continuous humming sound, then radiated golden light. In the next moment, it sliced through space and vanished from sight. Its speed was so fast that even space showed no trace, leaving no sign of its passage.

"Escaped!" Luo Tian's fist struck empty air, hitting space and emitting a thunderous roar. He arrived at Jiang Nanxuan's side.

The crowd gazed at Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan, their faces filled with shock. The Yin-Yang Sect had always acted recklessly in the Divine Beast Realm, even daring to confront the divine and demonic realms. Yet now they had fled, leaving the Soul-Devouring Flag uncollected.

"But we did gain something. At least, the other sects now look at us with fear and dare not attack us!"

"Moreover, those eighty-one Soul-Devouring Flags are priceless. Even you almost fell into their trap!" Jiang Nanxuan gazed at the flags still embedded in the stars, speaking softly.

Luo Tian also looked at those flags and nodded slightly. Under the greedy gazes of the surrounding crowd, he retrieved the flag and handed it to Jiang Nanxuan.

"I suppose this thing will be very helpful for you!" Luo Tian smiled, thinking it was a waste to keep it himself.

The crowd's eyes grew heated, but no one dared to approach and snatch it. One reason was that Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan were powerful; the other was that these were the Yin-Yang Sect's items. Though they had fled, it didn't mean the sect would swallow this humiliation.

Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan each took a pill, then stepped to the front of the crowd. The people made way for them, but no one dared to talk with Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan, fearing being caught in the crossfire of the Yin-Yang Sect's wrath.

Meanwhile, several major sects remained silent. It was better to avoid trouble; they didn't fear the Yin-Yang Sect, but adding an enemy without reason was a loss.

Yet some people still approached Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan to chat. A youth in gray robes, with sly eyes, approached Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan, bowing respectfully.

"Brother Luo Tian, I suppose you two are also here for the Divine Beast Grand Ceremony?" The youth's face was filled with excitement, gazing at the Divine Beast Ancient Cave and speaking to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian carefully observed the youth, noting his sly appearance. He couldn't help but laugh: "Don't you fear being caught up in your trouble and retaliated by the Yin-Yang Sect?"

"Actually, even if I'm not caught up with you, I would still be retaliated by these sects!" The youth sighed, gazing at the surrounding sects and speaking to Luo Tian.

"Hmm?" Indeed, when the youth appeared before him, the faces of the major sects suddenly changed. Their eyes flashed with murderous intent toward the youth.

"Sun Konian!" The people of several major sects gazed at the youth beside Luo Tian, gritting their teeth. This made Luo Tian puzzled.

"Are you the one who dug up their ancestors' graves? I feel they hate you so much!" Luo Tian said with a joke, addressing Sun Konian.

But the next moment, both Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan were stunned. Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Sun Konian did not deny it but instead proudly lifted his head.

"Sun Konian! Three years ago, you trespassed into my sect's ancestral tomb. I never expected you to appear again!"

"Sun Konian, you took four sacred weapons from my sect's ancestral tomb. Hand them over immediately, or I might beg the elder to spare your life!" As Luo Tian's words fell, it seemed to ignite everyone's anger. The elders and disciples of the major sects all stood up, addressing Sun Konian.

However, they did not attack; after all, he was standing before Luo Tian. They didn't know what relationship Sun Konian had with Luo Tian.

Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan's mouths twitched as they watched the youth, realizing that Luo Tian had indeed guessed correctly. This Sun Konian had truly dug up their ancestors' graves.

"Hmph! Just because of you, I'm getting caught in this!" Sun Konian stood beside Luo Tian, straightened his posture, and addressed the people who glared at him.

"Indeed, he's Sun Konian. I never expected him to know Luo Tian!" The crowd gazed at Luo Tian with some hostility.

"Heard that Sun Konian, the grave robber, has only been avoided by a few sects. Once, he was chased from the Divine Beast Realm all the way to the Demon Domain by a late-stage Sage elder. I never expected him to survive, obviously possessing considerable skills!" The crowd murmured, watching Sun Konian beside Luo Tian.

"Damn it! I was tricked!" Luo Tian's face darkened as he listened to the crowd's murmurs and the rising hostility. He looked at the eyes of the surrounding people, feeling a bad premonition.

"Everyone, I met this person by chance. Today was our first meeting. I never expected him to be so evil. I'll help everyone catch this despicable bastard!" Luo Tian's face changed, but it was clearly him who had been dragged into this. Thinking of that, he quickly spoke to the crowd, extending his hand toward Sun Konian.

"Brother Luo, why are you doing this? We just agreed on the price to hit other sects!" Sun Konian's face showed disbelief. He turned around, his body twisted oddly, dodging Luo Tian's hand.

"Sun, why are you framing me!" Hearing Sun Konian's words, Luo Tian was furious.

"Give me your two fake Epoch Treasures, and I'll help you out of this crisis!" Sun Konian's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, making Luo Tian's face red with anger.

"Indeed, you were waiting for me!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly and swung his hand again toward Sun Konian. Obviously, he wanted to have Luo Tian surrounded so he could take the Wounding Heaven Bow and Epoch Bell.

"Everyone, attack together! Don't let these two bastards escape!" Someone in the crowd shouted. A golden hand materialized and rushed toward Luo Tian and Sun Konian.

This strike ignited the fuse, as powerful martial arts from people's hands coalesced and rushed toward Luo Tian and Sun Konian.

"Damn it, he has accomplices!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly, trying to find the source of the voice but failing. He looked at the powerful martial arts and his mouth twitched, then glanced at his side—where was Sun Konian?

Chapter 1062: The Divine Beast Lord

Outside the Divine Beast Ancient Cave, martial arts rained down, filling the entire starry sky. Even with his strength, Luo Tian had no choice but to flee; he could not even consider fighting back.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian's mood was terrible. Being tricked so unexpectedly, anyone would feel bad.

He turned around to slap Sun Konian but found no sign of him at all.

"Luo Tian! Run!" Jiang Nanxuan's voice carried urgency as he saw the martial arts that had filled the sky. He took out an array disc and spoke to Luo Tian.

"Sun Konian, wait for me!" Luo Tian shouted, standing before Jiang Nanxuan. Jiang Nanxuan quickly activated the array disc, and both vanished into the starry sky.

"Boom..." The waves spread out. The martial arts launched by everyone turned the entire starry sky into a vacuum, and it took an hour to calm down.

"Escaped?" After the waves faded, people stared at the empty starry sky with grim faces. They never expected that even in this situation, Luo Tian and Sun Konian had escaped.

From then on, people confirmed that Luo Tian and Sun Konian were accomplices. However, some smart individuals knew that Luo Tian was not an accomplice of Sun Konian. But those major sects, even if they knew, would pretend not to know. After all, one faction could not take down Luo Tian; they had to pretend ignorance and unite everyone to attack him, then find a way to get Luo Tian's Epoch Bell and Wounding Heaven Bow.

In short, people needed an excuse to attack Luo Tian. Major sects needed all three-stage strength; independent cultivators needed a reason to unite against the demon realm's pursuit.

"Cough cough..." Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan appeared thousands of miles away, both coughing up blood. They looked at the trembling waves that had filled the starry sky with fear. Even from afar, Luo Tian felt a deep shock. If they hadn't escaped quickly, even a slight hesitation would have turned them into dust.

"Damn it, Sun Konian! I'll never forgive you!" Luo Tian roared, his voice echoing with endless anger.

Originally, he had defeated the Yin-Yang Sect and could have stood proudly in the Divine Beast Ancient Cave. Now he had to be cautious, being labeled as a grave robber's accomplice and hunted by everyone.

"Never mind, now it's no use. Let's think of a way to return. The Divine Beast Ancient Cave is important!" Jiang Nanxuan shook his head gently, even though he had been tricked. He showed no anger.

"Brother Jiang, your temper is really good!" Luo Tian shook his head, his eyes filled with thought.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian was thinking about how to disguise himself and return, a wave spread out. A youth walked from the distance in the starry sky toward Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan.

"Master, save me!" The youth shouted, and soon appeared before Luo Tian, his face filled with desperation.

Luo Tian's eyes flashed with light as he scrutinized the youth. The youth looked ragged, his cultivation was only a step beyond Sage, and he was covered in blood, showing severe injuries.

The youth flew toward Luo Tian's front, his eyes weak as he looked at Luo Tian with a begging gaze. "Master, I encountered robbers. Please save me!"

After speaking, he fell to his knees. However, soon after, his eyes flickered slightly, as if about to faint.

"Haha, kid, I never thought you'd run this time!" As Luo Tian was about to get up, a loud laugh echoed into his and Jiang Nanxuan's ears.

"Feeling familiar?" Luo Tian's face showed a slight confusion, gazing at the big man who had flown close. The man was of mid-stage Sage cultivation, with a rugged face and full of ferocity, looking at the youth who had collapsed before Luo Tian.

"Friend, I advise you not to interfere. This kid stole my things; I'm going to skin him alive!" The big man seemed to sense Luo Tian's powerful cultivation and bowed respectfully.

Luo Tian's eyes flashed with purple light, gazing at the big man to find a familiar feeling. However, soon after, Luo Tian's heart sneered.

"Crack..." Luo Tian swung his hand, reaching for his waist. In the next moment, a clear sound echoed from his hand.

"Fast speed!" Luo Tian's eyes showed mockery. His hand held a weak arm, his gaze filled with mockery as he looked at the seemingly nearly unconscious youth.

Jiang Nanxuan's eyes widened; Luo Tian's speed was too fast, even he hadn't noticed his attack. In an instant, Luo Tian had grabbed the youth's arm.

"Fine, I don't care. I'll help you kill him!" Luo Tian swung his hand and struck toward the youth he had grabbed. This punch could have killed a late-stage Sage.

But just as Luo Tian's hand was about to strike the youth, the seemingly weak youth suddenly changed face. His thin arm shrank in an awkward way. At the same time, the youth leaped up like a nimble monkey from Luo Tian's front.

"Damn it, you son of a bitch! You even dared to reach for my head! What's this, a chain of tricks!" Luo Tian roared, swinging the Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist toward the weak youth.

"Damn it, Sun Konian! You didn't say he was seriously injured and defenseless!" The monkey-like youth, sensing the power of Luo Tian's fist, shouted in panic but was not hit by Luo Tian's punch. He instantly appeared before the big man who had chased him.

"Damn it, you said you couldn't steal anything! But you still failed!" The big man saw the youth appear before him and no longer had his previous ferocity. He shouted at the youth.

"Truly a good performance! If it weren't for my Purple Extreme Demon Eyes, I might have fallen into your trap!" Luo Tian stepped forward, his spear of splitting the sky swirling with endless storms toward the two.

"Brother Luo, this is a misunderstanding! A misunderstanding, listen to me! We were just playing a joke!" The big man saw the trap had been exposed and immediately returned to his original appearance. Along with the agile youth, they flew toward the distance at incredible speed, causing Luo Tian to slightly startle.

"Brother, we have a connection. I believe we'll meet again!" Sun Konian's voice echoed in the void, and their figures were already far away.

"Damn it, those two bastards escaped again!" Luo Tian roared, his voice filled with annoyance. Sun Konian and this monkey-like youth were truly as slippery as eels, no wonder they could escape even under the pursuit of a late-stage Sage.

"Alright, these two are indeed remarkable people. But you should also feel that they only wanted your fake Epoch Treasures, not your life. If they had intended to kill you, they wouldn't have left so easily!" Jiang Nanxuan smiled and approached Luo Tian.

"Alright, since they're interested in my fake Epoch Treasures, they'll definitely strike again. When we meet next, I'll definitely teach them a lesson. Since I started cultivating, this is the first time I've suffered such a big loss!" Luo Tian shook his head gently and then turned his gaze back to the Divine Beast Ancient Cave.

"Change your appearance, the previous one will definitely draw attacks if we return!" Luo Tian sighed and shook his head. His physique and demeanor had undergone a complete transformation.

Jiang Nanxuan also changed his appearance, then set up a simple array on both of them to avoid recognition. They returned to the crowd at the Divine Beast Ancient Cave.

This time, they were very low-key, merely standing outside the crowd instead of being as bold as before when almost killing the Yin-Yang Holy Son.

"Are these sects also here for the Divine Beast Grand Ceremony? I advise you not to think about it. People like us, if we enter, will definitely die. It's better to watch from the outside!"

"Yes, do you know what this Divine Beast Ancient Cave is? It's said that the Divine Beast Lord was buried here. The resting place of the Epoch Lord, it won't be easy at all!" People murmured, their faces filled with admiration as they gazed at the seemingly deep Divine Beast Ancient Cave.

"Divine Beast Lord!" Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan exchanged glances, their eyes filled with a hint of shock. They had heard about the Divine Beast Lord in the demon realm's ancient texts.
