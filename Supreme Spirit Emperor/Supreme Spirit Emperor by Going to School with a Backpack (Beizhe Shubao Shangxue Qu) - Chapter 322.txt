“Has it finally opened!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with joy, standing behind Fu Xingxuan. He glanced at the three early epoch masters. When Luo Tian’s gaze fell upon a man in gray robes, his brows furrowed slightly. For some reason, Luo Tian felt a familiar sensation from the gray-robed elder.

“Xiao Ding, I want you dead!” Fu Yunpeng glared at Luo Tian behind Fu Xingxuan, his eyes filled with ruthless intent. He then subtly moved his lips and whispered mentally to an elder behind Fu Xingxuan.

Chapter 1317: Thunder Sea Eruption

Outside the Thunder Roar Hall, an elder in blue robes behind Fu Xingxuan bore a respectful expression. But when Fu Yunpeng’s words echoed in the elder’s mind, his gaze shifted toward Luo Tian, eyes flashing with a hint of killing intent.

“Killing intent!” Luo Tian’s perception was unparalleled. As the elder released his killer qi, Luo Tian sensed it instantly and pinpointed its origin, turning toward his side.

“Discovered? Impossible. A mere late-stage Saint could not sense my killer intent!” The elder gazed at Luo Tian, murmuring to himself.

“Su Xingwang! Why does he want me dead?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He recognized this elder—only a few early epoch masters resided in Star Moon Divine City, all summoned by Fu Xingyue’s three brothers. Su Xingwang was the one brought by the eldest prince.

“My current status has offended two people—one is this girl Fu Xingxuan, the other Fu Yunpeng!” Luo Tian quickly identified the root cause, his spiritual sense scanning through the crowd to locate Fu Yunpeng.

“It seems this Thunder Roar Hall has added another challenge,” Luo Tian mused, glancing at the three elders behind Fu Xingxuan and sighing.

“Old fool, hope you have eyes to see. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being harsh!” Luo Tian muttered coldly.

“Let’s go!” Fu Xingyang, Fu Xingyue, and Fu Xingchen led the group into the Thunder Roar Hall.

“We should go too,” Fu Xingxuan said, excitement in her expression, addressing the three early epoch masters. This was her first time entering the Thunder Roar Hall.

“Xiao Ding, stay close to me,” Fu Xingxuan said playfully to Luo Tian. Though her tone was light, Luo Tian detected the underlying gravity in her words.

“This girl!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly, wearing a fearful expression as he followed Fu Xingxuan.

“Hmph. A late-stage Saint entering the Thunder Roar Hall—unprecedented! I’ll look after you,” Su Xingwang said with a feigned gentle smile, his voice concealing killer intent no one could detect.

“Ah, Princess, let’s hurry,” the gray-robed elder of Fu Xingchen said with a faint smile, addressing Fu Xingxuan.

“Let’s go!” Fu Xingxuan led Luo Tian into the Thunder Roar Hall.

*Crack!* As they stepped inside, thunder surged around them.

Though the lightning’s power was not overwhelming, it remained within their capacity. Yet as they entered, Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan were stunned.

The Thunder Roar Hall appeared as a grand hall from the outside, but inside it was another world. It felt like entering a star domain, yet without stars. The entire black space teemed with lightning.

A rift opened in the distance, spewing waves of thunder outward like a flower composed of lightning. The overwhelming aura sent shivers through Luo Tian’s heart. He had no doubt that this terrifying lightning flower could annihilate any cultivator, even those at the epoch level.

“How could there be such terrifying lightning power!” Luo Tian mused, his familiarity with thunderstorms from alchemy and cultivation stages making this the first time he’d encountered such a force.

“Anything reaching its peak becomes apocalyptic,” one of the early epoch masters mused, his voice low.

As they spoke, Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingyang, and Fu Xingchen had already flown toward the lightning flower with their entourage. They knew the Imperial Seal must lie at the heart of the thunder sea.

“Is this an entrance to another realm?” Luo Tian asked, confusion in his gaze as he addressed Fu Xingxuan.

“Indeed. Beyond our origin domain, there are nine other realms. It’s said the thunder sea’s center holds a seal—a gateway to those nine realms. For years, our clan’s elders have sought entry. Rumors say these realms are far superior, rich in resources,” Fu Xingxuan said, her eyes alight with longing.

“Princess, when I grow stronger, I’ll take you to see those realms,” Luo Tian said with a fawning smile.

“Such an insincere little brat!” The three early epoch masters scoffed at Luo Tian’s words.

“Let’s chase after them. We can collect some moon thunder stones; they’ll greatly benefit your cultivation,” Fu Xingxuan chuckled, leaping forward to follow Fu Xingyue’s group.

“Is there no danger here?” Luo Tian asked, his voice low and fearful as he trailed Fu Xingxuan.

“Don’t worry. If nothing major happens, there’s no danger. Xiao Ding, I didn’t know you were so afraid of death,” Fu Xingxuan said lightly.

“Not that I fear death, but if I die, who’ll amuse the princess?” Luo Tian said softly, his voice resolute.

Hearing this, Fu Xingxuan’s body trembled. Her lips curled slightly: “Don’t worry. As long as I’m here, you won’t die.”

“Let’s hope so,” Luo Tian mused. As they spoke, the surrounding lightning grew more terrifying, testing Luo Tian’s endurance—his current status was merely late-stage Saint.

*Hum…* Fu Xingxuan extended a hand, releasing a glimmer of blue light that hovered above the group. Instantly, it blocked the thunderbolts striking them.

“Previous Star God Seal!” The gray-robed elder’s eyes gleamed with recognition, his voice low.

At that moment, Fu Xingyang and the others had vanished from Luo Tian’s sight. They clearly had a way to evade the thunder sea.

*Boom…* A deep rumble echoed. The lightning petals intensified, a terrifying storm of thunderbolts materializing before them.

“It’s happening! The thunder sea has erupted!” Su Xingwang said, excitement in his gaze as he stared at the storm.

“Moon thunder stones?” Luo Tian quickly noticed a green stone, about fist-sized, hovering at the storm’s center.

“Let’s secure moon thunder stones! Only with enough can we qualify to enter the lightning petals!” Fu Xingchen’s voice rang out. Next, figures rushed toward the storm.

“Brave indeed! That storm could kill even a half-epoch master. An early epoch master would be severely wounded if careless,” Luo Tian mused, watching Fu Xingyue’s group charge into the storm.

“Xiao Ding, go. I’ll fetch a few for you to boost your strength. You’re too weak!” Fu Xingxuan chuckled, activating the Star Moon Seal to lead Luo Tian and others toward a nearby storm.

In an instant, they reached the thunderstorm spanning the space.

“Go. Retrieve that moon thunder stone!” Fu Xingxuan pointed at one of the early epoch masters summoned by Fu Xingyue.

“Yes!” The elder had no choice but to comply. His body emerged from the Star Moon Seal’s protection, glowing with blue light as thunderbolts struck him.

*Flash!* The elder moved swiftly, grabbing the moon thunder stone and returning to Fu Xingxuan’s side. He panted heavily, handing the stone to her with lightning speed.

“Tsk tsk,” Luo Tian observed the elder, who had exited the storm with some disarray. His body emitted white smoke from lightning strikes.

*Boom!* As the elder retrieved the moon thunder stone, the storm collapsed into waves of lightning dispersing outward.

“Good,” Fu Xingxuan said, nodding as she took the stone and carelessly tossed it to Luo Tian.

“Take it and absorb it,” Fu Xingxuan said, her expression indifferent.

“This…” The three early epoch masters guarding Fu Xingxuan exchanged glances. They hadn’t expected Fu Xingxuan to treat a late-stage Saint so kindly.

“Mine!” At the same time, Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingyang, and Fu Xingchen, along with their entourage, began seizing moon thunder stones.

Early epoch masters acted alone, while half-epoch cultivators combined efforts. A hundred storms gradually diminished under their actions.

“Go and collect some too!” Fu Xingxuan stood still, instructing the three behind her.

“Yes!” They bowed respectfully and stepped out of the Star Moon Seal’s protection, flying toward the thunderstorm.

Time passed slowly. The storms dwindled, and disputes arose. Yet Fu Xingyue’s group seemed to have agreed not to attack the three assigned by Fu Xingxuan, leaving Luo Tian impressed with their loyalty.

Luo Tian had nothing to do but absorb the moon thunder stone in his hand. As he activated the Reincarnation Heaven Art, it instantly transmuted the stone.

*Crack!* As the moon thunder stone was absorbed, Luo Tian’s dantian surged with lightning. The vaguely formed Reincarnation Immortal Body absorbed it, becoming more solid.

“Excellent. This is faster than usual,” Luo Tian mused, then turned his gaze to others.

Chapter 1318: Return

At this moment, the thunderstorm dwindled. Early epoch masters clashed fiercely, vying for moon thunder stones at the storm’s center.

Compared to Fu Xingyue’s group fighting fiercely, the three early epoch masters guarding Fu Xingxuan faced little resistance. They collected the most without hindrance.

Soon, only a few storms remained, becoming targets for all. The three early epoch masters approached Fu Xingxuan respectfully, handing her their collected moon thunder stones.

Fu Xingyue’s purple eyes turned into a crescent moon, collecting the stones and glancing with satisfaction.

“Forty moon thunder stones!” Fu Xingyue counted, causing Luo Tian to gasp.

He now understood the Thunder Roar Hall’s rules: each eruption yielded only a hundred moon thunder stones. Fu Xingxuan had already secured forty, an unprecedented record since the hall’s opening. This revealed Fu Xingyue’s deep affection for her.

*Boom!* Fu Xingyue’s group heard the number, their faces darkening. They knew to enter the lightning petals’ core, one had to absorb at least twenty moon thunder stones to avoid the terrifying lightning. But Fu Xingxuan had forty, and Luo Tian had already absorbed one—no matter how they competed, someone would be eliminated.

“Second brother, do a favor and give me your moon thunder stones!” Fu Xingchen’s hands glowed fiercely as he attacked a late-stage Saint summoned by Fu Xingyue. This elder carried eight moon thunder stones.

“Yes, second brother. Give them up and rest,” Fu Xingyang said, attacking another elder.

“Damn!” Fu Xingyue’s heart sank. He hadn’t expected Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingchen to ally so quickly.

“Eldest prince still fears the second prince,” Luo Tian mused, observing Fu Xingyang’s intent. His current strength was unmatched—three early epoch masters under his command, and his own power rivaled Fu Xingyue’s.

Only one could enter the lightning petals. Eliminating Fu Xingyue would leave Luo Tian and Fu Xingchen to vie for the Star Moon Emperor’s Seal. With his strength, he could easily subdue Fu Xingchen, newly ascended to early epoch.

Watching the two elders summoned by Fu Xingyue struggling under Fu Xingchen and Fu Xingyang’s attacks, Fu Xingyue longed to rescue them. But six early epoch masters surrounded him.

“Alas…” Fu Xingyue’s heart ached. He knew he might be eliminated. At that moment, he missed Luo Tian—had he been here, they could have broken through the six early epoch masters effortlessly.

“Big brother, third brother! How dare you bully second brother!” Fu Xingxuan scolded the two, her lips pouting.

“…” Luo Tian was speechless. This girl truly naïve—competing for the throne, their three brothers were already kind. Yet to Fu Xingxuan, it seemed like a game.

Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingchen’s attacks grew heavier. They aimed to eliminate Fu Xingyue.

“Go help second brother!” Fu Xingxuan ordered the three behind her, her tone commanding.

“Huh…” The three exchanged glances. One elder accompanying Fu Xingyue smiled, rushing toward him.

“Huh…” Su Xingwang and the gray-robed elder exchanged glances, unsure of what to do. They were originally Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingchen’s allies, but now Fu Xingxuan ordered them to attack the two. How could they comply?

“Star Xiu, don’t play!” Fu Xingyang chided softly, his speed increasing as he conjured a massive epoch hand to crush the elder he faced.

*Puke!* The elder spat blood, falling into the void. His eyes held despair.

“Hmph!” Fu Xingyang grabbed the elder’s storage pouch, crushing it. Treasures scattered, most notably six moon thunder stones hovering before him.

“Total of twenty-seven!” Fu Xingyang sat, beginning to refine the stones.

Fu Xingyang only assigned one to guard him; the other two continued attacking Fu Xingyue.

“So fast!” Fu Xingyang’s hands flashed with brilliance, striking four early epoch masters. Though one ally joined him, Fu Xingyue had only a brief reprieve. Breaking through four attacks would take time.

This was due to the four early epoch masters hesitating, not daring to strike hard. Otherwise, Fu Xingyue’s situation would be dire.

*Haha!* Laughter echoed. Fu Xingchen struck a blue star, subduing the elder he faced.

*Crack!* The elder turned into blood mist, visible to all.

“Come here!” Fu Xingchen grabbed the elder’s storage pouch and began refining the stones without hesitation.

*A hum…* The blood mist elder appeared pale, his face filled with regret as he gazed at Fu Xingyue.

“Forgive me, second prince!” Another elder appeared, though not reborn in blood, he bore severe injuries.

“Alas…” Fu Xingyue sighed deeply. He ceased his attacks, gazing at Fu Xingyang refining the stones. His resentment was clear—he truly resented losing so easily.

“I won’t let you win so easily!” Fu Xingyue glanced at Fu Xingyang, intending to stop him. But seeing three early epoch masters guarding Fu Xingyang, he glanced at his own three elders and shook his head.

“It’s too unfair!” Fu Xingxuan pouted, flying toward Fu Xingyue. “Second brother, don’t fear. I still have more!”

Fu Xingxuan waved her hand, sending dozens of moon thunder stones to Fu Xingyue. With those he already had, it was more than enough twenty.

“Star Xiu, I owe you one!” Fu Xingyue took the stones without hesitation. He needed them and began refining immediately.

As Fu Xingyue refined, the Thunder Roar Hall fell silent except for thunderous sounds.

Time passed slowly. Fu Xingyang opened his eyes first, seeing Fu Xingyue seated. He sighed: “Princess, I’ve wasted your kindness.”

Fu Xingyang said no more and dashed toward the lightning petals. His speed was astonishing.

At Fu Xingyang’s movement, Fu Xingchen also opened his eyes. His early epoch strength had stabilized. Without a word, he flew toward the lightning petals.

“Let me end this!” Fu Xingyue’s voice echoed over the thunder, becoming a streak of white light. He followed.

“Alas…” Fu Xingxuan sighed, watching her third brother enter the thunder sea. Her expression was complex.

“Finally fair. Who succeeds is up to you,” Fu Xingxuan said softly, her voice resigned.

“Xiao Ding, take these and refine them. I’ll go watch the spectacle!” Fu Xingxuan tossed the remaining moon thunder stones to Luo Tian. She knew he needed them to enhance his cultivation.

“Princess, be careful!” Luo Tian’s voice carried gratitude. With these stones, his second Reincarnation Immortal Body would solidify further, nearing the epoch mid-stage.

“Let’s go! Let’s watch the spectacle!” Others chuckled and flew toward the lightning petals. None cared about Luo Tian’s fate—just a late-stage Saint, insignificant here.

“Good!” Others nodded and flew toward the lightning petals. Though they couldn’t reach the core, they could endure for a while.

They vanished from Luo Tian’s sight, leaving him with a smile.

Luo Tian didn’t rush to refine the moon thunder stones. His gaze was deep as he stood still in space, waiting for something.

“Kid, your alertness isn’t high enough yet!” Luo Tian waited a full quarter-hour. A weathered voice echoed from the void, and Su Xingwang appeared.

“Old fool, you want to kill me?” Luo Tian weighed the moon thunder stones in his hand before storing them. He gazed at Su Xingwang, who had returned.

“Can’t help it. I was ordered by others. Who else could you offend?” Su Xingwang smiled, approaching Luo Tian. His gaze fell on a late-stage Saint—though talented, the gap was too vast to warrant his attention.

Chapter 1319: The True Face

“Give you a chance to end it yourself. No need for me to act!” Su Xingwang smiled, his hands weaving seals. A series of runes erupted from him, surrounding them instantly. He wasn’t afraid Luo Tian would escape but feared others discovering their connection. After all, Fu Xingxuan valued Xiao Ding greatly, even giving him the remaining moon thunder stones.

“Hmph. Saves me trouble!” Luo Tian observed the seals, his lips curling in a smirk. He didn’t stop them but stood with arms crossed, gazing at Su Xingwang.

“Kid, what are you smiling about? Do you really think I won’t kill you? Princess Fu Xingxuan does care for you, but if I kill you, it’s just a reprimand,” Su Xingwang said, unsettled by Luo Tian’s smile.

“Hurry up. Your seal-setting speed is too slow! Let me help!” Luo Tian pointed, unleashing a torrent of epoch power. It formed a white cage, isolating them completely.

“Epoch power!” Su Xingwang’s face darkened instantly. He stared at Luo Tian, who still smiled.

“Who are you? Why hide your cultivation? I didn’t even sense it!” Su Xingwang’s mind trembled. A bad premonition arose—things had gone beyond his control.

“Tell you who I am after you die!” Luo Tian coldly said, rising swiftly. He became a streak of white light before Su Xingwang and punched.

“You’re early epoch! So what?” Su Xingwang’s face turned ruthless. He raised a wrinkled fist and punched Luo Tian.

*Crack!* The collision echoed, a thunderous crack. It felt like lightning had erupted between them, muffled by the white cage.

Next moment, Su Xingwang’s face turned pale. His aged body was thrown back, colliding with the white cage and leaving cracks. His eyes held disbelief.

“How strong!” Su Xingwang felt despair. That punch nearly shattered him, annihilating his entire arm in a single strike.

“Too weak! This strength wants to kill me?” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with amusement. He rushed toward Su Xingwang again, his two Reincarnation Immortal Bodies radiating epoch power. It spread across Luo Tian instantly.

“Moon God’s Wrath!” Su Xingwang roared, unleashing his secret technique. He knew only by fighting could he have a chance. Otherwise, against such a powerful Luo Tian, he had no path but death.

A pure moonlight rose within the cage. It formed a white figure, its palm pressing down like a mountain.

“Trash!” Luo Tian sneered. He unleashed the Da Dao Sealing Fist and the Fan Tian Attack, striking the white palm.

*Boom!* The thunderous sound echoed. That massive hand was shattered by Luo Tian’s punch, and he didn’t stop. He directly obliterated the moon god-like illusion.

“Is this even human!” Su Xingwang felt despair. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so powerful, even defeating his strongest attack.

“That punch could have wounded my past self,” Luo Tian mused with a smile. His joy was immense—now, he was invincible among early epoch masters.

“Open!” Su Xingwang had no courage to fight Luo Tian. He channeled his strength into the cage, trying to break it and escape.

*Crack!* As Su Xingwang struck repeatedly, the white cage cracked. It seemed about to shatter.

“Martial God’s Wrath!” But as Su Xingwang felt a chance, Luo Tian’s voice echoed like death.

*Boom!* Luo Tian stood atop Su Xingwang, lifting his leg to stomp down.

*Pound!* A golden foot crushed Su Xingwang’s body, annihilating him instantly.

*A hum…* A few drops of blood coalesced. Su Xingwang’s body appeared before Luo Tian, his cultivation plummeted.

“Martial clan! You’re from the Martial Clan. But how could you possess my Star Moon Divine Clan’s body!” Su Xingwang’s face showed disbelief. His voice held shock.

“Let you see my true face. Let you die peacefully!” Luo Tian extended his white hand, gently lifting it to reveal Fu Mengchen’s face before Su Xingwang.

“Fu Mengchen!” Su Xingwang trembled, his aged body shaking. He stared at Luo Tian’s face in shock—Xiao Ding was Fu Mengchen.

“Impossible! Why!”

“Fu Mengchen is…” Su Xingwang’s words were cut off. He suddenly slapped his waist’s jade token, transmitting a mental message.

But before he finished, a colossal foot descended. It crushed Su Xingwang’s body again, annihilating him.

Yet this time, Su Xingwang never revived. He was utterly dead at Luo Tian’s hands.

“Since you saw me, I wouldn’t let you live!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with coldness. He waved his hand, dispersing the cage. His face returned to Xiao Ding’s.

*Boom!* As Luo Tian appeared, a powerful boom echoed in his mind.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He felt the tremor’s terror—even he couldn’t withstand it. His face shifted slightly.

He then identified the source: from outside the lightning petals. His heart tightened, and he moved away from the booming.

Inside the thunder sea petals, a token hovered at the center. Below it, three figures clashed—Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingyang, and Fu Xingchen.

Ten thousand miles away, Fu Xingxuan’s head bore the Star Moon Seal, emitting moonlight to protect her from the terrifying thunder.

Outside the petals, an elder in gray robes smiled. The area was empty. His gaze fell on Fu Xingxuan at the petals’ edge, his eyes cold.

“Who are you!” Fu Xingxuan trembled. Her gaze fell on the gray-robed elder, fear in her eyes.

She had witnessed his cruelty—nearly ten early epoch masters and ten half-epoch cultivators died at his hands.

Fu Xingxuan had lived in Star Moon Divine City all her life, spoiled by everyone. She’d never seen death before. Now, watching twenty lives perish, she was paralyzed.

She wanted to run toward Fu Xingyue’s group but found herself locked by the elder. She couldn’t move. His cultivation—epoch late stage, even higher than her father’s.

Fu Xingxuan knew that even if she reached Fu Xingyue, her three brothers would die too.

At this moment, she hoped they’d end their fight quickly and claim the Star Moon Emperor’s Seal. Then her father Fu Tianba might sense it and rescue them.

“Hmph. I’ve heard Star Xiu is as beautiful as the heavens. Today, she truly is,” the gray-robed elder said with a bloodthirsty glint. He slowly approached Fu Xingxuan, thunderbolts striking his body, emitting gray smoke.

“Who are you!” Fu Xingxuan retreated inward. The pressure grew stronger with each step.

“Star Xiu, you used me well earlier. Now it’s my turn to use you!” The elder’s cultivation radiated, his face twisted with a repulsive smile.

*Crack!* As Fu Xingxuan retreated, she seemed to cross a threshold. Terrifying thunder struck the elder, causing his eyes to narrow in pain.

“Damn thunder!” The elder cursed. He saw Fu Xingxuan just one thousand zhang away, frustration in his eyes.

“Hmph. Star Xiu, you can’t escape. I’ll go kill that Xiao Ding kid. Even if he refined the moon thunder stones, I’ll extract them from his body!” The elder smiled cruelly.

*A hum…* As the elder’s words ended, Luo Tian appeared outside the petals. The elder’s face darkened instantly.

“Ah? You came to me?” The gray-robed elder smiled, sensing Luo Tian’s arrival. His face twisted with ferocity.

“Combat tremors—did those people get killed by that old fool?” Luo Tian stood still, his mind racing. He immediately changed expression.

“Damn! Epoch late stage!” Luo Tian felt the elder’s overwhelming pressure. No hesitation, he turned and fled at his maximum speed.

Chapter 1320: The Mysterious Clan

“Hahahaha… Young man, your speed is good. Unfortunately, you can’t escape!” As Luo Tian turned, the gray-robed elder’s voice echoed in his ears. Cold air locked him down.

Luo Tian stopped abruptly. He knew he couldn’t escape an epoch late stage master. The Thunder Roar Hall seemed vast, but there was nowhere to run.

“Damn!” Luo Tian had no choice but to turn back. He knew the thunder sea petals were his best escape route.

At this moment, he didn’t care about exposure. He became a streak of light, rushing toward Fu Xingxuan.

“Fast!” Fu Xingxuan’s eyes widened. She gazed at Luo Tian flying toward her, surprised by his speed—far beyond a late-stage Saint.

“Epoch early!” Fu Xingxuan’s eyes flashed with light. Her heart felt blocked. She knew Luo Tian had hidden his cultivation, deceiving her all along.

“Ah…” Luo Tian activated the Ghost Step of the Netherworld, pushing his speed to its limit. Yet he still felt a death threat.

“Damn it! I just wanted to find an epoch mid-stage opponent. Why did a late-stage elder appear!” Luo Tian seethed.

“Return!” But even with his speed, it was insufficient before the gray-robed elder. The terrifying pressure locked him down, slowing his speed.

Luo Tian felt like he’d fallen into a swamp. Cold sweat poured down his forehead.

“Haha, keep running! You’re rare with such talent!” The elder’s voice echoed behind him. He appeared like a ghost, materializing behind Luo Tian.

“Da Dao Sealing Fist!” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate. He swung his fist, unleashing all his strength. His two Reincarnation Immortal Bodies surged with power, radiating ten thousand lights.

The Fan Tian Attack was added to the Da Dao Sealing Fist. His attack was overwhelming, capable of wounding even an epoch mid-stage.

“Hmph?” The elder’s eyes narrowed. He felt the punch’s danger and pointed his finger at Luo Tian.

Gray energy erupted, as if destroying everything. It condensed into a thick finger, crushing toward Luo Tian.

*Boom!* The space trembled as they collided. A violent storm swept outward, submerging the surrounding thunderbolts.

The text ends here with a continuation of the battle.
