“Wummm…” The Yugui Seal descended, eight ghost channels of true immortal power surged. Heaven and earth darkened; within the black whirlpool, a thick ghostly claw extended as if a powerful beast sought to break free from the black heavens.

“Grrr…” The Three-Headed Dog roared, black lightning descended from the sky, striking the Bloodthirsty City Lord.

Huang Baisui (Yellow and White Water) also moved his hands swiftly, yellow river water with purifying power poured down, sweeping toward the Bloodthirsty Ghost King.

The true immortal mid-stage ghost entity also unleashed a frenzied attack, its grotesque face lunging to devour the Bloodthirsty City Lord.

The heavens trembled, violent energy caused all the ghosts in Tiansha City to kneel, their eyes filled with awe.

Too strong! The techniques unleashed by Luo Tian and others—each could annihilate them multiple times.

“Brrr…” As the people marveled, the red network on the Bloodthirsty City Lord’s body vanished entirely, clearing his gaze.

Boom… Boom…

At the same time, their attacks thundered down, colliding with the Bloodthirsty City Lord’s body. The vast black heavens began to shatter.

The Big-Eyed Monster collapsed onto the ground, eyes closed, breathing heavily.

Luo Tian and others panted, gazing at the Bloodthirsty City Lord engulfed by martial techniques. A surge of power spread outward, flattening the land within ten thousand feet, with many Tianxia ghosts annihilated by the terrifying force.

“Is Master Bloodthirsty City Lord truly dead?” The surrounding ghosts gazed with disbelief.

At the same time, hope stirred in their hearts. If not forced, who would willingly be controlled and lose freedom? They also knew if they continued like this, they would eventually be hunted.

“He’s not dead,” Luo Tian murmured, his gaze on the fading explosion. If the Bloodthirsty City Lord was unharmed, they would have to flee.

A furious roar echoed; a crimson river appeared in their sight, forming the Bloodthirsty City Lord’s figure.

At this moment, the Bloodthirsty City Lord wore tattered robes, his face pale, spitting blood continuously. Luo Tian’s eyes lit with joy—the Bloodthirsty City Lord no longer radiated true immortal peak power but had dropped to the mid-stage.

“Finally, he’s fallen to the mid-stage!” Huang Baisui’s eyes gleamed with joy, his gaze on the Bloodthirsty City Lord descending from the sky.

“Do you think, by dropping to mid-stage true immortal, you can defeat me?” The Bloodthirsty City Lord’s face twisted with resentment, his gaze sweeping over Luo Tian and others.

Chapter 2113: Madness ()

“Even if I’ve dropped to mid-stage true immortal, what can you do against me?” The Bloodthirsty City Lord’s face twisted with ferocity, his pale body standing between Luo Tian and others. His gaze swept over Luo Tian.

“Blood Ocean Soaring High!” The Bloodthirsty City Lord bellowed, red bloodwater surged again, dyeing the ground crimson. A blood-colored dragon swept forward toward Luo Tian and his companions.

“Too weak!” Luo Tian saw the blood-colored dragon approaching, his face showed no fear but joy. The attack’s power was far weaker than before; even with martial techniques, it lacked the previous pressure.

Luo Tian clenched his fist, threefold physical strength struck, shattering the blood dragon. He leapt into the air, rushing toward the Bloodthirsty City Lord.

The Three-Headed Dog also opened its mouth, exhaling a cold breath that froze the blood dragon into black lightning, striking the Bloodthirsty City Lord.

Huang Baisui soared upward, transforming into a yellow river that swept up the Big-Eyed Ghost and exited the battlefield.

In Tiansha City, the Big-Eyed Ghost and Huang Baisui had a good relationship. Now that the Big-Eyed Ghost was unconscious, if caught by the Bloodthirsty City Lord, it would die.

The true immortal mid-stage ghost entity wore a wild expression, black scales covering its body. It punched the blood dragon, recoiling and escaping the battlefield, its face pale.

“Get out!” The Bloodthirsty City Lord roared, colliding with Luo Tian. Though Luo Tian’s body was thrown back, it wasn’t as helpless as before.

“Grrr…” The Three-Headed Dog bit the Bloodthirsty City Lord’s body, tearing off a chunk of blood. The Bloodthirsty City Lord raged, slapping the Three-Headed Dog away.

“Dharma Body!” Luo Tian pressed his hands, his body expanding explosively. A surge of power radiated from him.

“World!” A thousand-foot-tall giant appeared, Luo Tian reciting the Man Shen War Chant. With a thunderous step, he executed the Seven Steps of the Man Shen.

One step landed, the void trembled; a thick foot descended upon the Bloodthirsty City Lord. Simultaneously, Luo Tian’s hands shifted rapidly; a hellish ghost claw descended from the sky, merging with his hand. With the Wind-Blade Enhancement, it crushed the Bloodthirsty City Lord.

“Bloodclaw!” The Bloodthirsty City Lord launched a crimson hand, colliding instantly with the descending hellish ghost claw.

“Crash…!” At the same time, the Bloodthirsty City Lord transformed into a pool of blood, crushed by the descending foot.

Blood ocean soared high; a crimson river surged upward, forming a blood dragon that climbed Luo Tian’s leg toward his heart. It writhed and transformed into the Bloodthirsty City Lord’s figure.

“Boom…!” Thunderous collisions erupted; hellish ghost claws clashed with blood-colored claws, divine power radiating. The void shattered, buildings crumbled again, and more ghosts turned into swirling black mist.

“Flee!” Ghosts ran toward the outskirts of Tiansha City, knowing if they stayed, they would die from the two’s battle.

“You’re of no use now!” The Bloodthirsty City Lord appeared at Luo Tian’s heart, two blood hands forming icy fangs, stabbing toward him.

“Yugui Seal!” Luo Tian extended a hand; the Moon of Demon descended, crushing the Bloodthirsty City Lord.

“Plop…” Blood flowed from Luo Tian’s chest; the Bloodthirsty City Lord immediately retreated. If he didn’t leave, he would be crushed by the Yugui Seal.

The Bloodthirsty City Lord’s figure appeared, his fingers stained with divine essence blood. He licked his fingertip, this blood coming from Luo Tian.

“Wummm…” After licking, the Bloodthirsty City Lord’s face changed drastically. He gazed at Luo Tian as if viewing the most delicious food, his complexion even reddened.

“Your blood is truly delectable; it’s stronger than I imagined!” The Bloodthirsty City Lord’s face twisted with madness. He could sense that devouring Luo Tian’s blood would propel him into the half-step仙王 (Saiwang).

“Explosive!” The Bloodthirsty City Lord pressed his hands, explosions echoed across the heavens. Those fleeing ghosts exploded, turning into swirling black mist.

“They were your followers; you’re so heartless?” Luo Tian’s foot descended again, crushing the Bloodthirsty City Lord.

“You’re useless now,” the Bloodthirsty City Lord roared, “I’ll enter half-step Saiwang once I kill you!” His face twisted with madness; a blood hand struck Luo Tian’s foot.

“Tread… tread…” The massive body retreated, shattering buildings. Luo Tian’s face showed a hint of joy.

“Good, now I can unleash my full power!” Luo Tian’s face showed a hint of joy, gazing at the Three-Headed Dog.

“Big Black, are you bored? I allow you to use your true form!” Luo Tian called to the Three-Headed Dog, his voice laced with amusement.

“Grrr…” The Three-Headed Dog roared, its small body hindering its power. Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, it showed excitement, howling and expanding rapidly.

Black lightning descended; in the Bloodthirsty City Lord’s shock, the Three-Headed Dog’s three massive heads split into three fierce auras.

“Three-Headed Dog!” The Bloodthirsty City Lord cried out, gazing at the massive body with disbelief.

“Wummm…” Black divine light rose; Luo Tian wielded the Shijian Bow, firing a soul-destroying arrow. The massive arrow pierced through space, appearing before the dazed Bloodthirsty City Lord.

“This…!” The remaining mid-stage true immortal ghost’s face changed, gazing at the massive Three-Headed Dog. A sense of helplessness surged within him.

“I must be dreaming!” The Big-Eyed Ghost rubbed his eyes, waking from unconsciousness. Upon seeing the Three-Headed Dog’s massive body, he was stunned.

“How is this possible!” At Tiansha City’s outskirts, a figure with a long sword stood, his face filled with disbelief. This was Chen Dao (Chen Knife).

Chen Dao never expected the big dog by Luo Tian’s side to be a Three-Headed Dog, a totem of hell. If this spread, it would shake the entire hell.

He had been secretly observing Luo Tian. He planned to strike when Luo Tian couldn’t endure, but he hadn’t expected Luo Tian to have so many hidden cards.

“Explosive Arrow!” Black shadows exploded before the Bloodthirsty City Lord, sending him flying. His head rang; he nearly died from Luo Tian’s arrow.

A blood river surged, forming the Bloodthirsty City Lord’s figure. Upon formation, a thunderstorm descended, destroying heaven and earth.

After the thunderstorm came poison gas, instantly eroding the Bloodthirsty City Lord. Ice-cold power swept over him, freezing him in an instant.

A thick foot descended upon the Bloodthirsty City Lord, sharp teeth glinting with cold light. His greedy gaze fell on the frozen Bloodthirsty City Lord.

“Crack…!” Ice shattered; the Bloodthirsty City Lord transformed into a crimson red light, evading the Three-Headed Dog’s attack.

“Blood Ancestor Body!” The Bloodthirsty City Lord trembled, gazing at Luo Tian and the Three-Headed Dog. At this moment, he wanted to flee; Luo Tian’s soul-destroying arrow and the Three-Headed Dog’s attack had severely wounded him.

“Crash…!” A blood river surged, the red water forming a towering figure.

The Bloodthirsty City Lord wanted to flee but had to dodge the Three-Headed Dog and Luo Tian’s speed.

A blood fist凝聚, colliding with Luo Tian’s fist again. Luo Tian’s body retreated, while a large amount of blood fell from the Bloodthirsty City Lord’s formed blood body.

“Boom…” On another side, the Three-Headed Dog’s body collided with the blood body again, causing more blood to fall.

Luo Tian and the Three-Headed Dog flanked the Bloodthirsty City Lord, giving him no chance to escape. The Bloodthirsty City Lord raged.

Boom… Boom…

Collisions echoed, blood rivers fell onto the ground. The Bloodthirsty City Lord’s power gradually declined.

Luo Tian also spat blood; the Bloodthirsty City Lord was formidable. If he were still at true immortal peak, Luo Tian and the Three-Headed Dog wouldn’t have stood a chance. Even at mid-stage true immortal, they had to endure injuries to contain him.

“Kid, let me go! From now on, we’ll stay out of each other’s way. You take your path, I’ll take mine!” The Bloodthirsty City Lord roared. With each confrontation, he felt weakness; if they continued, his cultivation might drop to mid-stage true immortal.

The Bloodthirsty City Lord’s growth was rapid; he reached true immortal peak in a century. However, there were drawbacks: besides needing to drink blood daily, if he suffered severe injuries, his cultivation would drop.

If he dropped to mid-stage true immortal, either Luo Tian or the Three-Headed Dog could crush him. He’d have no chance of survival.

“Impossible!” Luo Tian wouldn’t let the Bloodthirsty City Lord escape; he’d give no chance.

“I submit to you! Okay?” The Bloodthirsty City Lord roared, his mind nearly breaking. He had no choice but to surrender and submit.

“Do you think I need that?” Luo Tian’s face showed disdain, his fist striking again, further lowering the Bloodthirsty City Lord’s power.

“I’ll fight you to the death! You all die with me!” The Bloodthirsty City Lord finally went mad. His blood body transformed into a blood ocean, then suddenly condensed into a crimson pearl, shrinking violently. A terrifying aura radiated from the pearl.

“Beware!” Huang Baisui shouted, while Chen Dao, hiding in the shadows, raised his long sword.

Chapter 2114: The Secret of Tiansha City ()

The crimson pearl hovered in the sky, emitting destructive waves. Luo Tian’s face changed drastically.

Luo Tian trembled; the Three-Headed Dog’s silver eyes turned to fear, gazing at the crimson pearl.

“Explosion! Run!” Luo Tian faced the Bloodthirsty City Lord’s suicidal attack and chose to flee. Even if he endured, he’d be severely injured.

“Want to run? Where?” The Bloodthirsty City Lord’s mad voice echoed, and an invisible pressure surged, subduing Luo Tian and the Three-Headed Dog.

“I agree to your submission! I accept it! Please return to your original form!” Luo Tian shouted, his voice carrying negotiation.

“You damned fool! Why didn’t you say that earlier!” The Bloodthirsty City Lord cursed. He had no choice but to use this move, but once unleashed, he couldn’t recall it; he’d have to die with the enemy.

The crimson pearl shrank further. Luo Tian felt his blood boiling, as if it could ignite at any moment.

“Blood Explosion!” The Bloodthirsty City Lord roared, the pearl finally reaching its limit. At the same time, Luo Tian felt a force pulling him; his blood vessels trembled violently, spewing blood as if breaking through.

“Woof… Woof…” As everyone trembled, a dog’s bark echoed in their ears. Black lightning shot out, rushing toward the tiny crimson pearl.

“Erhei, come back!” Luo Tian shouted, but his body radiated golden light. The black figure in his dantian danced rapidly, emitting a terrifying aura.

The heavens trembled; nearby, Chen Dao, preparing to strike, turned pale under the pressure.

This aura wasn’t anything else—it was Luo Tian’s ultimate secret weapon… The Book of Epochs!

Two auras collided, instantly freeing Luo Tian. This aura also made the impending blood pearl waver.

“What is this!” The Bloodthirsty City Lord’s voice rose in shock, filled with awe.

The Big-Eyed Ghost and the remaining mid-stage true immortal ghost fell to the ground, only Huang Baisui radiated yellow light.

“Woof… Woof…” Erhei barked twice, then extended its tongue to lick the crimson pearl. This made Luo Tian’s eyes widen in surprise.

“Nothing?” Luo Tian heard Erhei’s barks, his face puzzled; he halted the plan to activate the Book of Epochs.

“Stupid dog, what are you doing? Why lick me!” The Bloodthirsty City Lord roared.

“I can’t move!” Then the Bloodthirsty City Lord cried out, feeling he no longer obeyed his commands. He stood frozen.

“Gulugulu…” Erhei’s eyes gleamed with greed; without hesitation, it swallowed the pearl.

“Swallowed… swallowed…” Luo Tian stammered, watching Erhei swallow the blood pearl.

“Boom… Boom…!” Thunderous sounds echoed within Erhei’s belly, and its body grew even fatter.

Erhei licked its lips, looking satisfied. It transformed into a streak of light, diving into Luo Tian’s stunned wrist.

“You… really don’t pick your meals…” Luo Tian wore a bitter smile, feeling he had raised a monster.

“This dog could even swallow it!” Chen Dao’s face showed disbelief. That blood pearl, if exploded, would have been a challenge for him; saving Luo Tian would cost some damage.

But that blood pearl, which could wound a true immortal peak, was swallowed by a Tianxia-level dog.

“Monsters! This Luo Chen is a monster, and these two dogs are monsters too… Baisui, what kind of freak did you raise!” Chen Dao’s mouth twitched, watching Luo Tian. He felt the supreme aura from before still lingering in his heart.

“Too fierce!” The Big-Eyed Ghost and the mid-stage true immortal ghost stared at Luo Tian, speechless.

Even Huang Baisui was like that; he hadn’t expected Luo Tian to gain another companion. Though it looked harmless, it had swallowed the Bloodthirsty City Lord’s fatal attack.

“Guess the Bloodthirsty City Lord will never believe he was devoured by a Tianxia-level dog! The most embarrassing true immortal peak…” Huang Baisui and the others muttered, their eyes glowing with excitement.

Because the Bloodthirsty City Lord was dead; they had succeeded in killing a true immortal peak. This was beyond their previous imagination.

If it were before, Luo Tian wouldn’t have dared to dream of this; if the Bloodthirsty City Lord hadn’t declined, the outcome would have been their deaths.

There was also a chance involved; this battle exposed too much, the Three-Headed Dog revealed its true form. If it weren’t for Erhei swallowing that blood pearl, Luo Tian would have had to use the Book of Epochs.

A tough battle—this was the most difficult battle Luo Tian had faced in the Immortal Realm. But if this victory spread, it would scare people to death.

Previously, Luo Tian had successfully killed a true immortal mid-stage with a surprise attack; now he had fought face-to-face against a true immortal mid-stage. The two were incomparable.

The Three-Headed Dog returned to its normal size, retreating into Luo Tian’s wrist collar for rest. Luo Tian slowly descended, his body wounded and exhausted.

“Master!” The Big-Eyed Ghost and the mid-stage true immortal ghost looked with respect. Though the Bloodthirsty City Lord’s threat was gone, there was still Luo Tian’s Yugui Seal binding them.

“You’ve changed a lot!” Huang Baisui said, gazing at Luo Tian with admiration. He had watched Luo Tian grow; when he was a Tianxia-level ghost, the ghost king followed him.

“Rest,” Luo Tian sat cross-legged, a smile on his face as he began to recover from his injuries.

Huang Baisui, the Big-Eyed Ghost, and others also sat cross-legged, recovering. This battle had drained them too.

Time passed slowly; the four of them recovered for a full day before fully regaining their strength. Luo Tian opened his eyes slowly.

“Alright, let’s go check the dungeon,” Luo Tian stood up, gazing toward the dungeon.

At this moment, the palace in the dungeon was completely destroyed, leaving only a dark entrance with a stench of decay.

The people in the dungeon were also anxious; they couldn’t see Luo Tian’s battle but could hear the thunderous explosions, shaking the dungeon constantly.

“What happened outside? Is someone attacking Tiansha City?” People whispered, expecting the sound.

But they just thought; the Bloodthirsty City Lord was a true immortal peak. Besides ruling here, the beast kings and three families, who dared to attack him? And the Bloodthirsty City Lord was also cunning; if he met someone too strong, he would avoid.

“Boom… Boom…” Luo Tian and the others pushed aside the rubble blocking the dungeon, entering it.

Upon seeing Luo Tian and Huang Baisui, people were disappointed; they had thought too much.

“This kid has such strong vitality? After being drained of blood by the Bloodthirsty City Lord, he still has such energy?” People were surprised.

Luo Tian ignored the people’s murmurs and headed to the deepest part of the dungeon, where he found Ye Chen and five others.

“How are you doing?” The old man who had been crushed by Luo Tian before saw Huang Baisui and others, sneering.

They had once hoped Luo Tian would bring family members to subdue the Bloodthirsty City Lord. They had also felt the battle sounds, feeling more excited.

But now, seeing Luo Tian return with Huang Baisui and others, they knew no matter what happened outside, Luo Tian still hadn’t escaped their fate.

The old man finally couldn’t hold back; he spat out a string of sarcastic words, thinking Luo Tian wouldn’t kill them.

“Very comfortable; I fought and feel refreshed!” Luo Tian yawned, his gaze playfully looking at the three generations.

“Comfortable is still to come! Who do you think you are? Without strength, you act tough. Kid, once the Bloodthirsty City Lord torments us like this, I’ll show you what pain is!” The youth spoke, and the middle-aged man joined in. The three generations kept speaking, their voices filled with disdain.

“Big brother, I’m here to rescue you!” Luo Tian smiled and called out to Ye Chen, who looked puzzled.

Huang Baisui extended his hand; a black seal dragon formed, wrapping around Ye Chen and pulling him out.

“This…!” Ye Chen was stunned, gazing at Luo Tian with disbelief.

The three generations’ faces also showed surprise; the old man opened his eyes, a smile on his face.

“Kill them!” Luo Tian spoke softly, leading Ye Chen out of the dungeon.

“How can you walk freely…” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the three generations’ faces changed. They now felt something was wrong.

“Grandpa, let me out! I call you grandpa!” The youth finally understood why and shouted at Luo Tian.

But he was met with a black dragon, which wrapped around him and crushed him. The Big-Eyed Ghost and others also attacked, killing the old man and middle-aged man. Now, only the old man remained in the dungeon.

“Big brother, let’s talk outside. I haven’t breathed fresh air for a long time!” The old man’s eyes flashed with light, walking toward the dungeon entrance.

“Okay, good! Big brother, let’s go out too. I feel we have a connection; no need to say more, it's fate!” Luo Tian patted Ye Chen’s shoulder, nearly knocking him over.

Ye Chen’s mouth twitched; he followed Luo Tian out of the dungeon.

“Master, please free us!” Seeing Luo Tian truly freeing them, people in the dungeon shouted, their voices filled with excitement.

A life of darkness and suffering, being kept as livestock to be drained daily had made them unable to endure.

“Huang大哥, you handle it. From now on, you’re in charge here. Although Beast King City is far from this place, it’s still within the Beast King City’s territory. Wait for me to write a letter; take it to the Beast Ghost King City and find someone named Wang Lie. He’ll help you!” Luo Tian spoke softly; he believed this favor would be enough for Wang Lie.

“Everyone, wait here. If you haven’t done anything against heaven and earth, I’ll let you go!” Huang Baisui spoke to the crowd, making their faces burst into joy. Most of them were residents of Tiansha City and hadn’t done anything major.

“Of course, if you’ve done something against heaven and earth, I’m sorry; stay here. Don’t think you can trick me; I know your kind well!” Huang Baisui added, then followed Luo Tian out of the dungeon.

Exiting the dungeon, the old man and Ye Chen took deep breaths of fresh air, their eyes filled with joy. They gazed at the destroyed Tiansha City, stunned.

“Tell me, what secret is it? If it doesn’t interest me, you won’t have it easy!” Luo Tian smiled and spoke to the old man.

Huang Baisui, the Big-Eyed Ghost, and others silently surrounded the old man, giving him no chance to escape.

As for Ye Chen, he stood nearby; he didn’t plan to flee. He was a cultivator from Bubian City, and if he fled, he might be hunted by hell’s cultivators and ghosts.

Luo Tian valued him so much; Ye Chen had decided to stay by his side, protecting himself and waiting for an opportunity to return to Bubian City.

“Little brother, don’t be nervous. Look at my current ghostly appearance; can I escape?” The old man took a few deep breaths, gazing at Luo Tian.

“My name is Zhou Sha (Zhou Chaos), a wandering cultivator from another world. Two years ago, I came to settle in Tiansha City, but later was captured by the Bloodthirsty City Lord!”

“I obtained a map, a treasure map. Following various clues, I found this Tiansha City!”

“After years of research, I finally discovered the treasure’s exact location. Do you know what it contains?” Zhou Sha spoke softly, his voice filled with excitement.

“What is it?” Luo Tian showed interest, waiting for the old man to speak.

“Hell’s Seven凶剑 (Fearsome Swords)!” The old man spoke one word at a time, his eyes gleaming with pride.

“What?” Upon hearing Zhou Sha’s words, besides Luo Tian and Ye Chen, Huang Baisui and the Big-Eyed Ghost’s faces showed shock.

“Yes, it’s Longyuan Sword!” The old man saw their expressions and felt satisfied, his eyes gleaming with pride.

“The Seven Fearsome Swords are famous treasures in hell. Each is an elite divine weapon, but each contains fierce qi; few can wield them!”

“However, every time the Seven Fearsome Swords appear, they cause bloodshed in hell, sparking competition among major forces! Even the Ten Courts of Yama would intervene! Once, the Rasha Sword was obtained by the Ten Courts of Yama, and the Jueyun Sword was taken by Fengdu Palace. The remaining five are unknown!” Huang Baisui’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, making him tremble.

“Elite divine weapon!” Luo Tian knew the four words alone were enough to make many people go mad.

“Little brother, how about it? My information is shocking enough, I think the entrance is under the City Lord’s mansion!” Zhou Sha spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian.

“I’ll lead you in; I don’t need the Longyuan Sword. I heard the Seven Fearsome Swords are filled with fierce qi; the Longyuan Sword ranks fourth, long buried underground. It must have accumulated a lot of fierce qi. I just need this fierce qi to restore my cultivation, okay?” Zhou Sha spoke, his voice laced with a smile.

“Okay! But you must eat this pill first; I’m afraid you’ll trick me!” Luo Tian waved his hand, and a black pill appeared before Zhou Sha.

“This isn’t good; now I’m like this, any of you could kill me. What trick would I pull?” Zhou Sha frowned, responding.

“Eat it, you bastard!” The Big-Eyed Ghost glared, grabbing the thin Zhou Sha and choking him.

“Master, I’ll feed it to him!” Zhou Sha spoke to Luo Tian; Luo Tian didn’t object. He felt the old man was suspicious, so he handed the pill to the Big-Eyed Ghost.

The Big-Eyed Ghost poured the pill into the old man’s mouth, but he spat it out immediately.

“Ah… I don’t want to eat…” The Big-Eyed Ghost was unhappy, pouring the pill into his mouth again.

But the old man spat it out again; the Big-Eyed Ghost glared and hit him with another fist.

“You eat or not? If you don’t, I’ll kill you!” The Big-Eyed Ghost raged. Zhou Sha’s face turned red, tears in his eyes.

“You’re choking me! How can I eat!” Zhou Sha mentally roared, beating the Big-Eyed Ghost’s arm.

“Hey, you’re choking him!” A companion spoke to the Big-Eyed Ghost, his voice awkward.

Luo Tian and Huang Baisui also twitched their mouths, watching Zhou Sha’s pitiful expression.

“Ah…” The Big-Eyed Ghost realized and loosened his grip on Zhou Sha.

“You eat or not?” The Big-Eyed Ghost asked, coughing twice, his face awkward. He loosened Zhou Sha.

“I eat, okay…” Zhou Sha looked at the Big-Eyed Ghost, his eyes filled with委屈 (resentment). He had only resisted symbolically; this guy almost choked him to death.

Zhou Sha knew he couldn’t escape, so without hesitation, he swallowed the black pill. However, his face showed confusion because after swallowing it, he felt no discomfort; the pill didn’t spread but remained in his dantian.

“Alright, lead us!” Luo Tian smiled and spoke to Zhou Sha.

“Let me recover first; I’m very weak!” Zhou Sha spoke softly, his face showing weakness. He was originally a true immortal mid-stage but had been drained to true immortal mid-stage, and any true immortal mid-stage could crush him. In his view, the place where the Longyuan Sword was located must be extremely dangerous.

“No problem!” Luo Tian nodded; now the initiative was in his hands. If Zhou Sha tried to escape, he’d show him what it meant to be unable to eat and carry the burden.

Zhou Sha sat cross-legged, circulating his cultivation, beginning to absorb the ghost qi in the air. Luo Tian, meanwhile, was quite interested in heading toward the City Lord’s mansion. Huang Baisui and others returned to the dungeon, thinking about who to release.

Ye Chen also sat down; he didn’t know his fate next but tried to absorb the ghost qi to recover.

During this time in hell, Ye Chen had领悟 (realized) how to combine仙气 (immortal energy) and ghost qi. This was why he had survived until now.

After Luo Tian’s battle with the Bloodthirsty City Lord, the City Lord’s mansion was reduced to ruins. Luo Tian walked through the ruins without sensing anything unusual.

“Hmm?” After walking for an hour, Luo Tian finally noticed a strange place.

It was a crack, very unremarkable; if not carefully observed, it would be missed.

Luo Tian stepped to the edge of the crack, his brows furrowed slightly. He placed his hand there; a cold aura immediately transmitted to his palm.

“Fierce qi!” Luo Tian instantly knew what the aura was, letting out a low exclamation.

“Is there really the Longyuan Sword beneath this ground?” Luo Tian felt puzzled; he always sensed something was off. The Longyuan Sword was so famous, even the Ten Courts of Yama would fight over it. How could it be beneath this small Tiansha City?

“Maybe the battle with the Bloodthirsty City Lord caused changes underground?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, continuing to walk. However, before he had walked long, Zhou Sha’s voice echoed in his ears.

Zhou Sha still hadn’t recovered to true immortal mid-stage but had a better complexion now.

“How do we open this place?” Luo Tian asked, feeling somewhat passive but the Longyuan Sword had stirred his interest. After all, he didn’t have a suitable sword to perform the One-Sword-Through-the-Immortals technique.

Performing the One-Sword-Through-the-Immortals without it or with a regular sword was completely different. A normal sword couldn’t withstand the impact of One-Sword-Through-the-Immortals.

“Let me do it!” Zhou Sha’s eyes gleamed with pride, watching Huang Baisui and the Big-Eyed Ghost approach.

Chapter 2116: Longyuan City ()

Zhou Sha waved his hand, approaching the crack and placing it there. A wave of energy radiated from his hands, and the faint fierce qi seeped into Zhou Sha’s body, making him look delighted.

“This is the scent! The fierce qi underground must be immense!” Zhou Sha spoke, his voice filled with excitement. He then waved his hand again, pulling out a fragment of a map. Luo Tian and others were very curious, gazing at the fragment.
