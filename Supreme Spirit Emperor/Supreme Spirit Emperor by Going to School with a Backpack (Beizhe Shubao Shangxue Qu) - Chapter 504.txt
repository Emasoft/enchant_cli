“Make you call me old ancestor, and you must!” The sparrow opened its mouth and spat out a dark red flame lotus. Lo Tian and Miao Dezhù immediately jumped back in alarm.

The extreme heat instantly turned Lo Tian’s room to ashes. Seeing their reaction, the sparrow’s eyes gleamed with satisfaction.

“Still…!” A cold voice echoed from the sparrow. Lo Tian and Miao Dezhù froze mid-air, their eyes wide with disbelief as they gazed at the sparrow.

“Such a technique!” Lo Tian trembled, feeling that within a hundred miles, this sparrow was the absolute master. Even a single thought from it could disperse him.

“Boom…” The dark red flame lotus exploded with a thunderous roar, rising in front of Lo Tian and Miao Dezhù.

In an instant, the fire transformed into a pattern that appeared before their eyes, causing both men to frown in confusion.

Though just an image, the mere shadow gave Lo Tian and Miao Dezhù a sense of awe. A phoenix body with a dragon tail, the sound of dragon and phoenix harmonizing echoed through the sky.

“I am the noble Long Que. How dare you say my bloodline is inferior to that little mud snake on your body? And this little runt, have you ever heard of Long Que!”

“Do you see? This is my mighty form from the past. But now I am injured, and to recover quickly, I’ve taken this shape!” The sparrow’s voice echoed through the heavens with a croaking tone.

“Long Que!” Lo Tian and Miao Dezhù’s minds trembled as they gazed at the phoenix-body-dragon-tail figure, their hearts crying out in astonishment.

“Boom…” The illusion exploded with a thunderous roar, vanishing from their sight. The overwhelming aura also vanished abruptly. Strangely, the surroundings returned to normal as if time had reversed itself. Even Lo Tian’s room was restored, as though nothing had happened.

“How do you feel? Scared?” The sparrow’s eyes gleamed with smugness as it observed their stunned expressions.

“Master, Grandfather! Take me as your disciple!” Miao Dezhù immediately leapt from Lo Tian’s shoulder and rushed toward the sparrow.

“Is it really Long Que!” A voice echoed in Lo Tian’s mind, filled with disbelief.

“You know what Long Que is?” Lo Tian asked curiously.

“I only learned of Long Que after awakening my bloodline. I heard that in the mysterious world, there is a World Tree. This World Tree houses the origin of all fierce beasts. All fierce beasts in the world are descendants of those residing on the World Tree.”

“Long Que is one of the twelve origin beasts dwelling in the World Tree,” Lo Tian’s mind echoed with awe. His body trembled violently.

“So this sparrow… is truly your ancestor?” Lo Tian’s voice was filled with horror. He hadn’t expected Long Que to be such a formidable figure.

“Master, ancestor! Take me in!” Miao Dezhù shouted toward Long Que. “I am the Yellowness Phantom Sable, whose bloodline is the purest! Now only my grandfather and I remain!” But Long Que merely flew away without a glance, returning to the Beast Summoning Seal.

“Damn it, next time I shouldn’t show off so much. The domain’s consumption is too heavy!” Inside the Beast Summoning Seal, Long Que panted heavily.

“A true god!” Lo Tian didn’t know what level Long Que was at its peak, but after hearing Lo Jie’s explanation, he knew this Long Que must have been an extremely powerful being. The injury had reduced it to such a pitiful state.

“Focus on cultivating Dao Heart Seeding and collect demon seeds for me. If you don’t meet my monthly quota, I’ll kill you!” As Lo Tian was lost in thought, Long Que’s voice echoed within his mind.

“Again, trying to kill me!” Lo Tian’s lips twitched. At this moment, he felt a sense of reverence toward Long Que. Even injured, it was terrifying. If it were at its peak, how变态 would it be? Serving this ancestor properly could bring him great benefits.

“Wait… This old man is strong, but who injured him? Will he come looking for me?” Lo Tian’s body trembled as he thought of Long Que’s enemies. They must be overwhelmingly powerful, capable of annihilating him with a single spit.

“Fate is neither good nor bad. I should focus on strengthening myself!” Lo Tian sighed deeply.

Without further thought, Lo Tian sat cross-legged on his bed again and resumed cultivating Dao Heart Seeding. He knew Long Que needed a large number of demon seeds and pure cultivation.

“Dao Heart Seeding: Use your spiritual awareness to merge with the demon seal, then implant it into another’s dantian. The demon seal takes root and sprouts into a demon seed, used by the practitioner…” The incantations and meridians appeared in Lo Tian’s mind. His hands moved rapidly, forming strange seals.

Time passed slowly. A day had gone by when Lo Tian finally stepped out of the courtyard, holding a jade slip and flying out of Shenglong Sect toward the south.

After a day’s flight, Lo Tian arrived at a mountain range. He opened the jade slip and smiled.

“This is it—Feilang Bandits, notorious for their crimes. They murder people, burn homes, and abduct women. They are the kings of this region, feared by all within a hundred miles.” Lo Tian muttered quietly. His spiritual awareness spread out like waves, revealing the surrounding area within a mile in his mind.

“Come out!” Lo Tian shouted and slapped his hand, summoning a golden hand that descended from the sky. With a thunderous roar, it slammed into a small hill.

“Tianxian Late Stage!” A voice cried out from the hill. Several figures scattered in all directions, but Lo Tian wouldn’t let them escape. They were merely Tian Dao Stage beings; only two were at the early Tianxian stage.

“Come here!” The golden hand grabbed the two early Tianxian and pulled them forward. The remaining Tian Dao Stage beings were subdued by Lo Tian’s aura, coughing blood and lying on the ground.

“Why run? I won’t kill you!” Lo Tian smiled, locking the two early Tianxian and throwing them to the ground.

“Sir, we’ve no grudge! We’re good people!” A big man shouted, confused why this strong person had appeared.

“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you!” Lo Tian smiled at the group.

Chapter 1942: Catching a Fish in a Bowl

Lo Tian shook his head. Shenglong Sect had accurate information—these Feilang Bandits were bloodthirsty. Even if Lo Tian hadn’t come, another sect member or elder would have wiped them out.

Lo Tian waved his hands, and black seals flew from his palms. They transformed into black elders that rushed toward the group.

...

On a hundred-zhang-high mountain peak, in a dilapidated fortress, Lo Tian stood there with satisfaction.

Beside him were over a hundred people, their faces filled with fear as they gazed at Lo Tian. Their spiritual energy was now extremely weak, indistinguishable from commoners.

No one could imagine that these over a hundred commoners were the notorious Feilang Bandits. They stared at Lo Tian as if looking at a monster.

One attack, and not a single person was killed. Yet their cultivation had been completely taken. This was the first time they encountered such a situation.

“Only sixteen early Tianxian—this is pitiful!” Lo Tian held a black sphere in his hand, frowning.

“Buzz…” Lo Tian waved his hand and pressed the black sphere to his forehead. A surge of pure cultivation instantly flowed into his body, eventually gathering in his already two-trace golden elixir.

The pleasant sensation made Lo Tian groan. His cultivation had increased slightly, and he sighed softly. He had just devoured a Tian Dao Stage demon seed; the cultivation of Tianxian was much weaker.

The over ten early Tianxian demon seeds had been taken by the sparrow, who said it was interest. The Tian Dao Stage ones weren’t worth it, so they were left for Lo Tian.

“This interest is heavy,” Lo Tian muttered. He ignored the Feilang Bandits now turned into commoners, who would surely meet a bad end.

“Sigh…” Lo Tian sighed deeply and flew toward Shenglong Sect. His purpose here was to practice Dao Heart Seeding, ensuring it was foolproof.

...

In the luxurious bed of Shenglong City, built anew by Shenglong Sect, Nie Sheng sat up slowly. Beside him was Wan Youlan, her face pale but with a flush of redness, like a wild cat lying there.

“I didn’t expect you still kept your virginity. I’ll overlook the deception before. With your furnace body, I should reach early Tianxian within three years. Then I’ll take you back to Yousheng Mountain!” Nie Sheng gently patted Wan Youlan’s snow-white skin.

“You’re truly amazing, Master. I’m now completely drained!” Wan Youlan’s eyes showed weakness as she spoke to Nie Sheng. As a furnace body, she was at his mercy. Though dual cultivation had many benefits for Wan Youlan, Nie Sheng nearly drained her dry.

“Rest well. I’ll go to Shenglong Sect and bring that kid back. Then let you kill him yourself!” Nie Sheng put on his clothes.

“I also want to go. I want to see him grovel and beg!” Wan Youlan spoke with a fierce tone, trembling as she stood up. A sharp pain made her sweat cold, but she persisted in dressing before Nie Sheng.

“Good. Let’s go together!” Nie Sheng frowned, unsure why Wan Youlan hated Lo Tian so much.

He didn’t know that Wan Youlan’s hatred for Lo Tian was because he had killed Du Changtian, her lover. The more she hated Lo Tian, the more she cared for Du Changtian. It meant she hadn’t developed feelings for Nie Sheng, and their relationship was merely mutual exploitation.

Nie Sheng supported Wan Youlan as they flew toward Shenglong Sect.

...

In the grand hall of Shenglong Sect, Lo Tian immediately summoned Zang Yunfei and three others upon returning from Feilang Bandits.

“Three old ancestors, just control him for now. The rest is mine!” Though Zang Yunfei and the others would definitely trap Nie Sheng here, Lo Tian still gave a warning. After all, Nie Sheng was backed by Yousheng Mountain; who knew what life-saving methods he had? If Nie Sheng escaped, it would be a disaster.

“Don’t worry. We’ve already reinforced this hall with an array. There’ll be no noise. Let’s catch him in a bowl!” Zang Yunfei spoke solemnly.

“Then let’s wait for this Yousheng Mountain genius. Let’s see what tricks he has!” Lo Tian smiled.

A flash of white light, Nie Sheng and Wan Youlan arrived at the gates of Shenglong Sect. Nie Sheng stood before the grand mountain gate without entering, instead standing with his hands folded.

“Wait. Wait for those three old ancestors to come out and greet us!” Nie Sheng spoke softly, causing two gatekeepers to frown.

“Who are you? State your name!” One of the gatekeepers shouted, his gaze cold.

“Nie Sheng… Yousheng…”

“Master Nie has arrived. Please forgive our negligence!” Before Nie Sheng could finish saying “Yousheng,” a cheerful laugh echoed from the mountain gate.

“Hm?” Nie Sheng looked at the person, frowning. He was waiting for Zang Yunfei and the others to come out, but instead a middle-aged man appeared.

“I am Zuo Qiu Ming, the Grand Master of Shenglong Sect’s Tianlong Hall. I’ve come to welcome you as per the old ancestors’ orders!” Zuo Qiu Ming smiled and approached Nie Sheng and Wan Youlan.

Zuo Qiu Ming’s presence was entirely Lo Tian’s arrangement. He had waited nearly an hour to welcome Nie Sheng in, preventing him from mentioning Yousheng Mountain. Previously, when Nie Sheng had come once without revealing his identity, it was also Zuo Qiu Ming who welcomed him. Only Zang Yunfei and three others, along with Lo Tian and five others knew Nie Sheng’s identity.

“You’re what? Let Zang Yunfei come out personally!” Nie Sheng coldly spoke. Even in the lower three realms, Nie Sheng was greeted by old ancestors at every sect.

“Master, our old ancestors asked for your forgiveness. They have to do this discreetly; they don’t want Shenglong Sect disciples to know too much!”

“Master wants the person you’ve controlled. Originally, they wanted to send him directly to you, but now you’ve come yourself!” Zuo Qiu Ming’s slight displeasure vanished instantly, yet he still spoke to Nie Sheng.

“Hm?” Though it was brief, Nie Sheng noticed it and his face turned slightly cold.

Zuo Qiu Ming led the way, guiding Nie Sheng and Wan Youlan into Shenglong Sect. Soon they arrived at the grand hall where Lo Tian and four others had set up.

“Master Nie, our old ancestors are waiting inside. Please enter!” Zuo Qiu Ming spoke to Nie Sheng, causing his steps to halt.

Nie Sheng frowned slightly, gazing at the grand hall. A strange feeling stirred in his heart.

“His vigilance is strong!” Lo Tian and Zang Yunfei three minds marveled. They hadn’t expected Nie Sheng to be so cautious.

“Open the door!” Nie Sheng ordered Zuo Qiu Ming, causing him to slightly tremble. Yet he slowly approached the grand hall’s door and gently opened it.

“Master Nie, we three old ancestors are sorry for not welcoming you. Please forgive us!” As the grand hall door opened, Zang Yunfei three appeared at the entrance with smiles.

“No problem. I know your intentions!” Nie Sheng spoke nonchalantly, seeing no signs of deceit on Zang Yunfei three’s faces.

“Master Nie, please enter. Lo Tian is inside and awaits your arrival! However, please don’t reveal your presence; Shenglong Sect has just been established. If the younger sect member’s death becomes known, it will cause unrest!” Pei Jianping spoke softly.

“I won’t enter. Have them bring the person to me. I have some matters and must return to Yousheng Mountain!” Nie Sheng spoke again, his premonition of danger growing stronger.

Upon hearing Nie Sheng’s words, Zang Yunfei three’s hearts sank. They hadn’t expected Nie Sheng to be so cautious, and they marveled at him.

“If there’s even a hint of danger, he won’t take the risk!” Lo Tian stood in the hall’s corner, silently praising him. This Nie Sheng was similar to himself.

“Attack!” Lo Tian saw Nie Sheng not entering and ordered Zang Yunfei three. As he spoke, he moved aside, unknowingly standing behind Nie Sheng and Wan Youlan. Zuo Qiu Ming’s body also suddenly trembled.

Almost as soon as Lo Tian finished speaking, Zang Yunfei three immediately moved. A late Tianxian stage aura descended upon them instantly, and three large hands rushed toward Nie Sheng and Wan Youlan.

“You dare!” Nie Sheng shouted, but the overwhelming pressure suppressed him. His voice couldn’t escape.

Though Nie Sheng was cautious, he hadn’t expected Zang Yunfei three to actually attack him. His face showed anger as Zang Yunfei’s hands appeared before him.

“Buzz…” A green light rose from Nie Sheng’s waist, forming a lush green mountain that blocked Nie Sheng and Wan Youlan.

Boom boom boom…

The thunderous sound echoed, shaking the entire Shenglong Mountain. Everyone’s faces showed shock, unsure of what had happened.

“Go…!” Nie Sheng retreated, ignoring Wan Youlan. He turned abruptly to flee. If he escaped, no one would dare harm him. Or if someone knew his identity, even if he died, the news would reach Yousheng Mountain. His father would avenge him!

“Return! I’ve been waiting for you!” However, as Nie Sheng turned, two golden hands slammed into his chest. Zuo Qiu Ming roared and used all his strength.

“Success!” Zang Yunfei three waved their hands again, grabbing Nie Sheng’s body. They pulled him into the grand hall. Wan Youlan’s body also crashed and fell into the hall.

Zuo Qiu Ming flew in, stepped into the grand hall, and quickly closed the door.

Everything seemed slow but happened in a flash. As soon as the grand hall’s door closed, figures appeared outside, their faces puzzled.

A golden dragon rose from the ground, instantly surrounding the entire hall. Everyone’s hearts tightened.

Chapter 1943: Nie Sheng's Techniques

“What happened? Who caused that loud noise? Is it the three old ancestors!” Li Changfeng and twenty early Tianxian strength beings stood in the sky, watching the hall with a rising barrier.

“It must be. That fluctuation made me feel scared. I can’t think of anyone else who could create such a big commotion!” The group whispered among themselves.

“Go back. We’re just training. Do what you need to do!” Zang Yunfei’s voice echoed in their ears, calming them.

“You dare attack me? You’re seeking death!” In the hall, Nie Sheng shouted repeatedly, his body gripped by golden hands.

“Is this the genius from Yousheng Mountain?” Lo Tian smiled as he stepped out of the corner.

“Lo Tian!” Nie Sheng saw Lo Tian and his face calmed. He looked at Lo Tian, knowing now what was happening.

“I’m curious who gave you the courage to attack me. If I die, you’ll all be buried with me!” Nie Sheng spoke softly, scanning Lo Tian and the five others.

“Smack…” Before Nie Sheng finished speaking, a purple hand directly struck his face.

“Damn it, even now you’re still showing off! Not only you, but even if your father came, we’d kill him today!” Miao Dezhù stood on Lo Tian’s shoulder, his eyes filled with disdain. He tried to put his hands behind his back habitually but found his claws too short, looking quite comical.

“You dare hit me! If you do, I’ll kill you today. Don’t think this is the lower three realms; my father will destroy your Shenglong Sect, leaving no survivors!” Nie Sheng’s face showed calmness as he constantly revealed his cards.

Zang Yunfei three also looked at Lo Tian. Now that Nie Sheng was controlled, it all depended on Lo Tian. It was like an arrow on a string; if Lo Tian failed or his plan didn’t work, they would all lose their lives.

“Who said we want to kill you!” Lo Tian’s eyes were deep, gazing at Nie Sheng. His eyes were like cold ponds, with black patterns swirling.

Seeing Lo Tian’s deep gaze, Nie Sheng felt a sudden spark. His hands sent out waves of energy, and a green talisman flew from his hand, transforming into a green flash. The entire hall was filled with strong vitality.

“Buzz…” The vibrant vitality transformed into a green sword, slicing toward the golden hand gripping Nie Sheng.

“Boom…” The next moment, the golden hand was instantly cut down by the green sword. A powerful wave of energy swept through the hall, annihilating all items within it. Lo Tian’s body also kept retreating.

Nie Sheng’s attack was too sudden; no one expected that a controlled Nie Sheng would pull such a move.

“No matter what your plan is, it still failed! My life-saving techniques are beyond your imagination!” Nie Sheng kept retreating, and as he did, he pulled out a green sword, slashing into the void.

The green cracks appeared in the hall. At the same time, the green sword shattered into a green passage before everyone’s eyes.

“Stop him!” Lo Tian shouted, and the Sh射 Sun Bow appeared in his hand. Three golden divine arrows instantly凝聚 from his hands, shooting toward Nie Sheng who was stepping into the green passage.

“Kill…” Zang Yunfei three’s faces were also frenzied. They rapidly unleashed their cultivation, instantly appearing in Nie Sheng’s path.

“Roar…” Three golden dragons emerged from Zang Yunfei three’s hands, forming a cage that rushed toward Nie Sheng.

“Yousheng Gate!” Nie Sheng sneered, pushing through the overwhelming pressure. His hands rapidly changed, and he pulled out nine talismans that exploded instantly. The thunderous sound echoed in the hall, and the powerful explosion directly shook Wan Youlan, making her pale face turn white and spit blood.

“Boom boom…” The explosion released a bronze door, radiating immense pressure. Even Zang Yunfei three’s faces turned serious.

The green door was just an illusion, but it carried overwhelming power. The three divine arrows shot by Lo Tian shattered instantly.

“Roar…” On the other side, three golden dragons collided with the green door, creating a thunderous sound.

Outside, Li Changfeng and others watched the hall. But they found it violently shaking, spreading throughout Shenglong Mountain as if an earthquake had occurred.

“Why are the old ancestors making such a big commotion!” The group whispered, looking at the hall. That golden barrier seemed on the verge of breaking.

“Is it the old ancestors testing a new martial technique?” Someone spoke, thinking of a possibility. Upon speaking, the crowd’s eyes lit up.

“It must be right! Lo Tian previously combined the flesh body of Di Long Sect and the Dragonless Body Art of Tianlong Sect. How could the old ancestors not!” The people became energized, thinking more and more it was likely.

Cracks in the void appeared within the hall. Lo Tian, Zuo Qiu Ming, and Wan Youlan were all covered in wounds.

“Surrender. Your resistance is useless!” Zang Yunfei three spoke softly, standing before the green passage and blocking it.

“Is that so?” Nie Sheng’s face turned pale, spitting out blood. His body was also wounded by the void cracks, more ragged than Lo Tian and others.

“Buzz…” Nie Sheng’s face showed mockery. He extended his hand, and a powerful storm instantly came from the green passage.

“What!” Zang Yunfei three’s faces changed wildly. They instantly felt an unknown force acting on them, a power beyond Tianxian strength.

“Do you know what this is? This is the life-saving technique given to my father by Yousheng Immortal King. Once opened, anyone near the passage will be transported away!” Nie Sheng’s face showed a cold smile. His voice was confident.

“Damn it!” Zang Yunfei three’s faces changed wildly, their bodies radiating power. But they felt as if grabbed by an invisible hand and pulled back. No matter how hard they struggled, they couldn’t break free.

“That’s that power!” Lo Tian’s eyes showed shock. He felt the storm within the green passage, his face changing violently. In that storm, he felt the same power as Long Que. He felt like an ant before Long Que.

Now, in front of that storm, he still felt the same sensation. Though not as strong as Long Que’s aura, it was still beyond his ability to withstand. Even Tianxian strength couldn’t resist; Zang Yunfei three were the example.

“He originally wanted to transport those three old ancestors away. He was confident that if he faced me, he could kill both me and Zuo Qiu Ming. Then he would be safe!” Lo Tian instantly understood Nie Sheng’s plan, gazing at him.

“Lo Tian, rely on you. We’ll find a way to return quickly. You must hold on!” Zang Yunfei three shouted, fully entering the green passage and disappearing from Lo Tian and Nie Sheng’s sight.

“Damn it!” Lo Tian cursed inwardly, his face extremely grim. He hadn’t expected Nie Sheng to have so many techniques.

“If he can summon those techniques again, I can’t resist!” Lo Tian prayed inwardly that Nie Sheng’s life-saving methods were exhausted. If they weren’t, he wouldn’t survive; neither would Zang Yunfei three, Zhao Tielong, Pei Jianping. Even Shenglong Sect would be destroyed.

“Now it’s your turn!” Nie Sheng smiled coldly, extending his hand. A crystalline pill fell into his mouth. His injuries instantly healed, and he radiated the aura of a late Tianxian.

“Damn it, this is really troublesome!” Lo Tian cursed inwardly. He also took a pill and swallowed it, his injuries slowly healing.

“Can’t lose. Absolutely can’t lose! I can’t afford to fail!” Lo Tian roared inwardly, three divine arrows凝聚 again. He drew the bow and shot toward Nie Sheng. His body also instantly moved, following the three divine arrows as he rushed toward Nie Sheng.

“Just you?” Nie Sheng showed disdain. His aura instantly surged, and he waved his hands. A dark black spear appeared in Nie Sheng’s hand, raised high to strike the three golden divine arrows.

“Whoosh…” Wind moved. The black spear left a dark afterimage, scattering the arrows.

“Supreme divine weapon!” Lo Tian’s mind trembled. He definitely wouldn’t dare to confront it with his body.

“This spear!” Lo Tian looked at Nie Sheng’s black spear, eyes filled with shock.

“Yellowness War Spear!” Lo Tian spoke out in disbelief. His heart clenched violently, gazing at the black spear. He hadn’t expected to meet Yellowness War Spear here.

“Rustic fellow, I didn’t expect you to have such knowledge. This is indeed Yellowness War Spear. It’s a ghost weapon from hell, obtained by my father when he guarded hell, slaying the division of a ghost general!” Nie Sheng spoke coldly. He swung his spear again, rushing toward Lo Tian.

“Impossible!” Lo Tian was stunned for a moment. The black spear instantly struck him.

“Brother, be careful!” Zuo Qiu Ming shouted. A golden sword flew from his hand toward Nie Sheng.

“Die!” Nie Sheng felt the sword’s aura behind him. He turned abruptly, sweeping his spear to strike the sword. The sword was sent flying back at even greater speed toward Zuo Qiu Ming.

Chapter 1944: Confrontation with Nie Sheng

Lo Tian never expected to meet Yellowness War Spear again. He clearly remembered that after entering the wilderness with him, his storage ring had shattered, leaving only the Cracked Heaven Spear within his body.

“Did Yellowness War Spear not break? Did it end up in hell and then fall into that ghost general’s hands?” Lo Tian was puzzled.

He also thought of a name, Yang Huanyu. His first great enemy in life. He had discovered it was just a trick, self-destructing his cultivation to complete the seal of Tianyuan Continent.

“Who knows if that ghost general is Yang Huanyu!” Lo Tian guessed. At this moment, he was already suspecting. After all, Zhang Daotian and others had been revived. It was possible that Yang Huanyu hadn’t died completely.

“This Yellowness War Spear isn’t the one from Yang Huanyu. It clearly emits the aura of a supreme divine weapon.” Lo Tian’s mind raced, thinking of many things.

“Puff…” A cold sword pierced Zuo Qiu Ming’s abdomen, making his face pale instantly. The powerful force sent him flying backward and pinned him against the hall’s wall.

“Big brother!” Lo Tian saw Zuo Qiu Ming, his eyes turning red. He cursed himself for being distracted at this moment.

“Don’t rush. It’ll be your turn next!” Nie Sheng’s face showed ferocity, returning to his previous arrogant posture.

“Lo Tian, didn’t you expect this? Our master is the sun in the sky. You are just sand on the ground. What if three late Tianxian? Our master still kills you!” Wan Youlan, her clothes torn and revealing much of her snow-white skin, showed a fierce expression as she gazed at Lo Tian.

Lo Tian took out a pill and fed it to Zuo Qiu Ming. His face was dark, dripping with water. That sword had avoided his vital points but pierced into Zuo Qiu Ming’s dantian. Lo Tian could feel Zuo Qiu Ming’s cultivation decreasing at a terrifying speed.

“Slut, don’t talk! You never learn!” Lo Tian waved his hand. Miao Dezhù transformed into a purple flash, rushing toward Wan Youlan. The purple light flashed, leaving three blood marks on her face.

“You dare scratch my face!” Wan Youlan screamed. Women always cared about their appearance.

“Kill…” Lo Tian took out the Zhenxian Brush and stepped into the void, rushing toward Nie Sheng. The gray brush rod collapsed space, swinging toward Nie Sheng.

“Supreme divine weapon!” Nie Sheng’s eyes narrowed. He hadn’t expected Lo Tian to have a supreme divine weapon either. However, Nie Sheng also had the will to kill him. In fact, he was more desperate than Lo Tian. Zang Yunfei three didn’t know where they had been transported, and if they returned, he would truly be unable to escape.

At this moment, the techniques his father had given him were also limited. He no longer had those powerful methods to counter late Tianxian.

“Crack…” The next moment, the two clashed. A violent fluctuation swept through the hall again. With a thunderous roar, both men retreated, their bodies colliding with the hall’s walls.

“Strong!” Lo Tian and Nie Sheng both thought of each other at the same time.

“Previously, when he faced sect elders’ challenges, he hadn’t used his full strength!” Nie Sheng thought to himself, instantly elevating Lo Tian’s level.

“Not a disgrace for the genius from Yousheng Mountain. But if I can’t even defeat this third-generation talent, how could I go to Yousheng Mountain to avenge my master!” Lo Tian thought to himself, gazing at Zuo Qiu Ming who was protected by Xiao Yue Tianlang Wang. If he didn’t treat him soon, Zuo Qiu Ming’s cultivation would be lost forever.

“Big brother, I have a way to save you. But from now on, your life will be in my hands!” Lo Tian spoke solemnly. He waved his hands, and five black dragons flew from his palms toward Zuo Qiu Ming, wrapping around him.

“Same year, same month, same day!” Zuo Qiu Ming’s face turned pale. He spoke softly, and the words made Lo Tian’s heart tremble deeply. This “same year, same month, same day” completely moved Lo Tian and from this moment on, he fully accepted Zuo Qiu Ming as a brother like Miao Dezhù and Nan Gong Yuqing!

“Dao Heart Seeding!” Lo Tian grabbed, and the five black dragons instantly entered Zuo Qiu Ming’s body. They began to absorb Zuo Qiu Ming’s dantian spiritual energy fiercely. The dragons gradually became real, forming a black demon seed floating in Zuo Qiu Ming’s dantian.

“This!” Zuo Qiu Ming’s mind trembled. He felt his cultivation no longer dispersing, recovering. His face showed disbelief.

At the same time, Zuo Qiu Ming also felt his cultivation was connected to Lo Tian’s. As long as Lo Tian wanted, years of hard work could be taken away at any time.

“Is it Dao Heart Seeding? I didn’t expect this. It’s truly a surprise! Seems I can’t kill you now! Need to capture him alive!” Nie Sheng’s face showed a glint of greed, gazing at Lo Tian.

“Come out, my loyal servant!” Nie Sheng’s hands formed seals. Waves of energy spread from his palms. A black figure instantly appeared in the hall.

Coldness immediately radiated from the black figure, its body filled with dark energy. Two cold glows emerged from its eyes.

The black figure was several zhang tall, with two horns on its head. Two dark whirlpools appeared on the horns, looking extremely sinister.

“Join me to capture him. If successful, I’ll release you and let you return to hell!” Nie Sheng spoke loudly, causing the black figure to tremble.

“Late Tianxian stage ghost king. My father captured as a slave. What do you have to fight me with? My techniques are far beyond what you can imagine!” Nie Sheng spoke coldly, then swung his Yellowness War Spear again toward Lo Tian. At the same time, the black ghost king rushed toward Lo Tian, its dark energy forming a sharp black sword in its hand.

“Unluckily, I also have one!” Lo Tian waved his hands. The Black Demon Moon hovered above his head. A black figure emerged from the moon, also filled with dark energy.

An invisible fluctuation spread from the Beast Summoning Seal. The late Tianxian stage ghost king immediately stopped its movement.

Lo Tian took up the Zhenxian Brush and clashed with Nie Sheng again. This time, however, he only retreated tens of zhang while Nie Sheng collided with the hall’s wall again.

“Beast Summoning Seal allows you to control it. If you can kill that ghost king, I’ll let Xiaohei give him a cup of yellow water!” Lo Tian spoke to the ghost king beside him, causing its eyes to show a sky-high light. Intense greed appeared in the ghost king’s eyes.

“Roar…” The ghost king roared, and the Black Demon Moon hovered above its head. With the Beast Summoning Seal, it rushed toward the horned ghost king.
