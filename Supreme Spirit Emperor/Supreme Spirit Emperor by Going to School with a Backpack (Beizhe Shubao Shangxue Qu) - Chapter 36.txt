“No!” Luo Tian resolutely refused Lu Kunpeng’s request. Now he had a better understanding of Lu Kunpeng’s character—that was the kind of person who, upon seeing something exceptional, would try to claim it as their own.

“Hmph!” Lu Kunpeng let out a cold snort, then waved his hand to retrieve the Soul-Subduing Cauldron into his storage pouch. But the cauldron remained defiantly upright on the ground.

Luo Tian chuckled, stepping beside the cauldron and gently stroking it. He could sense that this cauldron had become far more powerful than before. With a thought, it vanished from its place and reappeared within his storage ring.

“Little bastard!” Lu Kunpeng’s fury made his beard bristle as he smacked Luo Tian’s head.

At that moment, several elders and disciples from the Dan Sect arrived at Luo Tian and Lu Kunpeng’s side. They gazed respectfully at Lu Kunpeng, who was in disarray, while Luo Tian had been completely ignored.

“Congratulations, Grand Elder! Your Dan Sect cultivation has advanced further!” A chorus of respectful voices echoed from the crowd.

Lu Kunpeng’s mood improved despite his disheveled appearance, a hint of pride flickering on his face. Yet he secretly sighed—without Luo Tian’s Soul-Subduing Cauldron, he might have perished today.

Still, Lu Kunpeng did not reveal Luo Tian’s possession of the cauldron. Some treasures could incite envy, and he understood the wisdom of keeping wealth hidden. Besides, Luo Tian was still weak.

The crowd assumed the bronze cauldron belonged to Lu Kunpeng and did not press further. Amidst the congratulations, Lu Kunpeng and Luo Tian strode out together.

Chapter 171: The Transformation of Gu Yun

As Lu Kunpeng and Luo Tian strode toward the crowd’s edge, they discovered Gu Yun lying unconscious on the ground. A pool of crimson blood stained his chest. Seeing this, both men were stunned and rushed to Gu Yun’s side.

“Lin Zhengyang!” Luo Tian bellowed, his face contorted with fury. He had ordered Lin Zhengyang to escort Gu Yun out of the lightning realm, yet here Gu Yun was, unconscious. Lin Zhengyang stood calmly among the crowd.

Gu Yun had aided Luo Tian and was also the father of Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei. If anything happened to him, Luo Tian would never forgive himself. His heart was consumed by rage.

“Hum…” A surge of vital energy rippled through the air, and Luo Tian’s figure materialized before Lin Zhengyang, who was still dazed. Before Lin Zhengyang could react, Luo Tian’s powerful hands lifted him into the air.

“What happened? I demand an explanation!” Luo Tian asked coldly, his voice sharp but restrained. He had not yet struck Lin Zhengyang, merely dragging him before Gu Yun.

Lin Zhengyang, a direct disciple of Lu Kunpeng, had reached the ninth stage of body refinement. Yet he was far inferior to Luo Tian. He remained entranced by the joy of Lu Kunpeng’s Body-Refining Pill and had not expected someone to call his name, dragging him before the unconscious Gu Yun.

“This!” Lin Zhengyang stammered, his face filled with disbelief. He stood beside Gu Yun but remained unharmed, while Gu Yun had bled and collapsed.

“I don’t know!” Lin Zhengyang replied innocently.

The crowd, witnessing Luo Tian’s volatile anger, wore expressions of astonishment. Lin Zhengyang was a top-tier disciple in the Dan Sect, yet he had not even managed to resist before Luo Tian lifted him. People speculated about Luo Tian’s current cultivation level.

Wu Ping’an and Mu Nianqing in the crowd exchanged glances at Luo Tian, their cultivations high enough to sense his current stage. Though he was only at the eighth level of body refinement, his combat power rivaled that of an early-stage bone-refining stage. Lin Zhengyang’s ninth-level refinement could not even resist.

“Don’t know? A fine answer! You two were together, and now he’s bleeding and unconscious while you’re lively and well!”

As the crowd marveled, Luo Tian raised his other hand and launched a punch toward Lin Zhengyang’s chest.

This fist carried Luo Tian’s fury; if it struck, Lin Zhengyang would not fare well.

“Pang…” Just as Luo Tian’s fist neared Lin Zhengyang, a deep sound echoed.

“Little bastard! I thought you were composed, but you’re just as impulsive!” Lu Kunpeng’s voice rang out. His aged hand firmly grasped Luo Tian’s fist.

Luo Tian snapped back to his senses, releasing Lin Zhengyang onto the ground. His face bore a slight apology as he furrowed his brows, sensing his recent impatience. After a moment of reflection, he turned to gaze at the unconscious Gu Yun.

“Grand Elder, what’s his condition?” Luo Tian bowed respectfully.

Lu Kunpeng narrowed his eyes at Luo Tian, recalling that he was not typically impulsive. Yet seeing no abnormalities in Luo Tian, he replied, “It’s merely a surge of vital energy. However, something within his body seems to have awakened. Rest assured, it’s not harmful.”

Hearing Gu Yun was unharmed, Luo Tian felt relieved. Yet as he turned, his gaze fell on Lin Zhengyang’s fluctuating expression, deepening his regret.

Lin Zhengyang was equally exasperated. As a direct disciple of Lu Kunpeng, he had been lifted by someone of his own rank—this was an unbearable humiliation for a man with such pride.

“Lin Xiong, I acted rashly earlier. Please forgive my oversight!” Luo Tian bowed slightly to Lin Zhengyang.

“You!” Lin Zhengyang was at a loss for words. Without Luo Tian, he would have embarrassed himself before the entire Dan Sect. Was a simple apology enough to mend this?

Luo Tian observed the crowd, understanding that Lin Zhengyang’s status in the Dan Sect would surely plummet. He felt even more guilty, casting a pleading glance toward Lu Kunpeng.

Luo Tian knew that although Lin Zhengyang valued his pride, he would heed Lu Kunpeng’s words.

“Hmph!” Seeing the plea in Luo Tian’s eyes, Lu Kunpeng snorted and turned away, yet his gaze held a subtle understanding.

“Thirty medicinal herbs—absolute top-grade!” Luo Tian understood Lu Kunpeng’s intent from his expression and conveyed the offer through mental communication.

“Three hundred! Old man’s price is this!” Lu Kunpeng was delighted internally but maintained a solemn face.

“Fifty!”

“Two hundred and fifty!” Under the crowd’s puzzled glances, their mental exchanges continued. Lin Zhengyang remained fuming as he watched Lu Kunpeng.

“One hundred and fifty!”

“Deal.” After a fierce negotiation, they reached an agreement.

Lu Kunpeng smiled: “Zhengyang!”

“Yes, Master!” Seeing Lu Kunpeng’s intent to speak, Lin Zhengyang bowed respectfully.

“What do you think the most forbidden thing for a Dan Sect cultivator is?” Lu Kunpeng asked seriously.

“Is it mental acuity?” Lin Zhengyang inquired hesitantly.

“You’re wrong. Some say that strong mental acuity, high cultivation, and refined alchemical techniques make one a good Dan Sect cultivator. But I disagree!” Lu Kunpeng’s face bore solemnity as he taught his beloved disciple.

“Please, Master, enlighten me!” Lin Zhengyang asked again, puzzled.

“In my view, the most important quality for a Dan Sect cultivator is broad-mindedness. A broad mind can endure all things and embrace all people. Only then, at the peak of Dan Sect cultivation, can one become a furnace, using all things in heaven and earth as herbs. A single blade of grass, a grain of sand, or a drop of water can be refined into an elixir!” Lu Kunpeng’s face radiated the brilliance of a strict teacher as he spoke.

“Do you understand?” Lu Kunpeng ignored the respectful glances around him, his gaze sternly fixed on Lin Zhengyang.

Luo Tian watched Lu Kunpeng’s impassioned speech, and if not for their prior agreement, he would have thought Lu Kunpeng was merely correcting his disciple’s mistake.

Chapter 172: Consuming the Body-Refining Pill

Lu Kunpeng’s words thundered into everyone’s ears, and they all wore contemplative expressions. They gazed at Lu Kunpeng with deep respect.

Lin Zhengyang’s eyes also reflected thought before enlightenment dawned upon him. He bowed to Lu Kunpeng: “Thank you, Master, for your reminder. I now understand that Dan Sect cultivation is not merely about refining elixirs. To reach the peak, one must refine their mind!”

Luo Tian was stunned by Lin Zhengyang’s transformation. Glancing at Lu Kunpeng’s satisfied expression, he could not utter a word.

“Luo Tian, don’t hold it against me!” Lin Zhengyang’s face no longer bore the previous gloom. His gaze toward Luo Tian was filled with goodwill.

At that moment, Luo Tian realized he had been deceived. Lu Kunpeng had always intended to teach Lin Zhengyang to broaden his mind. He hadn’t expected himself to voluntarily offer one hundred and fifty medicinal herbs, and Lu Kunpeng had no reason not to accept.

Lu Kunpeng smiled at Lin Zhengyang, his most cherished disciple. He was truly in harmony with his master’s expectations—no matter what he said, Lin Zhengyang listened carefully and grasped it quickly.

“Enough. There’s nothing more to do here. Old man has other matters!” Lu Kunpeng waved his hand, signaling everyone to leave.

Seeing Lu Kunpeng’s dismissal, the crowd felt no longer welcome and respectfully bowed before returning to their quarters.

As people dispersed, two figures remained behind, their faces dark with resentment as they gazed at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian saw them and felt a pang of sorrow, signaling Lu Kunpeng and Lin Zhengyang to take Tian Bo to consume the Body-Refining Pill. He stayed behind.

Lu Kunpeng and Lin Zhengyang lifted Gu Yun from the ground, heading toward Tian Bo’s small courtyard. The sooner Tian Bo took the Body-Refining Pill, the greater his chances of recovery.

As they disappeared into the distance, Luo Tian whispered to Wu Ping’an and Mu Nianqing: “Elders, if you have questions, ask them. I will answer truthfully.”

“Luo Tian, I just want to know—our disciple truly was taken by the Yin Sect, as Gu Yun said?” Wu Ping’an’s face bore solemnity as he asked first.

“Yes!” Luo Tian replied bitterly, and under their serious gazes, he recounted the events in Tianyuan City.

Hearing Luo Tian’s account and Gu Yun’s, their faces darkened.

“Yin Sect! Even if you are a major sect in the Southern Region, you’ve overstepped!” Wu Ping’an’s feet cracked with energy.

They were reasonable people and would not blame Luo Tian for accompanying Gu Yun and Gu Qianxue down the mountain. Their eyes brimmed with killing intent.

Gu Yun and Gu Lei were their prized disciples. Wu Ping’an, in particular, had only Gu Lei as his disciple. To have his sole disciple taken was unbearable.

Wu Ping’an longed to storm the Yin Sect and rescue Gu Lei immediately, but he knew that despite his status in the Northern Region’s Five Elements Sect, he was nothing before major sects of the Southern Region.

The Southern Region was far richer than the Northern, and its cultivators were stronger by half a level. Don’t underestimate that half-level—higher levels made cultivation exponentially harder. A difference of half a level could mean the gap between heaven and earth.

Wu Ping’an and Mu Nianqing had heard of the Yin Sect, but they knew that even the Five Elements Sect would not dare confront it. Yet with their current strength, confronting the Yin Sect to retrieve Gu Lei was a futile dream.

With a touch of helplessness, they learned the truth and returned to their respective peaks.

Seeing the two peak masters’ helpless figures, Luo Tian knew the Yin Sect’s power had exceeded his imagination. From Gu Yun’s account, the Shangguan family was a core faction of the Yin Sect—only beneath the sect master. Rescuing two people under their noses was impossibly difficult.

Yet, Luo Tian quickly regained his vigor: “No matter what, I must try my best. Otherwise, who would I be answering to!”

After saying this, Luo Tian strode toward the back mountain, Gu’s courtyard.

…

At that moment, the Gu family’s faces were grim. Tian Bo had not yet awakened, and their patriarch Gu Yun had fallen unconscious again. The family was in disarray.

When they heard Lu Kunpeng say Gu Yun was unharmed, their hearts eased slightly but remained tense.

In Tian Bo’s room, his withered body lay in bed, his face devoid of color. If not treated promptly, Lu Kunpeng believed Tian Bo would not survive three days.

He sighed and retrieved the Body-Refining Pill from its jade vial.

As soon as it was taken out, the room filled with lush vitality. Lin Zhengyang stood nearby, feeling this abundant vitality and his body relaxed.

Lu Kunpeng smiled: “Seven parts of the vitality—good enough.” He then placed the Body-Refining Pill into Tian Bo’s mouth without hesitation.

The elixir dissolved upon entry, flooding Tian Bo’s meridians and dantian with vibrant energy and vitality. It nourished his lifeless body.

Seeing Tian Bo’s face gradually regain color, Lu Kunpeng wore a relieved expression—Luo Tian’s Body-Refining Pill had been correct.

Though Tian Bo showed improvement, Lu Kunpeng remained cautious, sitting by the bed to guard him, fearing any mishaps.

“Hum…” The vitality grew denser, forming a cocoon-like structure that wrapped Tian Bo’s withered body.

Luo Tian arrived in the room, extending his mental awareness into the vitality cocoon. He found Tian Bo had improved significantly compared to days before, and he sighed in relief, joining Lu Kunpeng in sitting cross-legged to guard.

Time passed slowly; seven days had elapsed.

The cocoon, formed by vitality, gradually weakened with time.

On the eighth day, the three of them opened their eyes, their expressions filled with joy.

Luo Tian gazed at the translucent cocoon, his lips curving slightly: “Finally coming out? I wonder what level he’ll recover to!”

As Luo Tian’s words ended, a tear split the cocoon. The Five Elements Sect’s energy converged into the courtyard of the Dan Sect, forming a swirling vortex that rushed into the cocoon.

The cocoon burst open, revealing an elderly man who appeared aged but radiated immense vitality and spirit.

Chapter 173: Negotiation

Seeing Tian Bo had improved significantly, Luo Tian exhaled in relief, his face alight with joy. His efforts over these days had not been in vain.

At that moment, the Five Elements Sect’s energy formed a river of vitality, swirling and pouring into Tian Bo’s body.

“Who is breaking through? So much energy—what level must they have reached to consume this much? The spectacle is massive!” The Five Elements Sect was captivated by the energy source.

“Again, the Dan Sect!” People gazed toward the Dan Sect’s direction. The shock of Lu Kunpeng’s Body-Refining Pill had just faded, and now another breakthrough was underway.

“This aura—definitely an early-stage bone-refining breakthrough! Even if it were a late-stage bone-refining breakthrough, it wouldn’t consume this much energy!” Other peak elders from various sects marveled.

“Seems the Dan Sect will gain another bone-refining strength! Who is it? Could it be Lu Kunpeng?” People speculated who was breaking through.

Luo Tian’s face bore joy. Though he didn’t know what level Gu Yun had reached in his prime, the aura now was far stronger than a late-stage bone-refining breakthrough.

If the Gu family had another yuan灵 (Nascent Soul) strength to guard it, Luo Tian wouldn’t have to worry about the Gu family anymore. A Nascent Soul strength held significant sway in the Northern Region.

As Luo Tian mused, the energy vortex above had fully converged into Tian Bo’s body.

Under the watchful eyes of Luo Tian and the others, Tian Bo’s cultivation level steadily rose.

“Body refinement stage five… nine… early-stage bone-refining…”

“Late-stage bone-refining… early-stage Nascent Soul!” After half an hour, Tian Bo’s cultivation level reached the early Nascent Soul stage and halted.

A long roar echoed from Tian Bo’s mouth, his aged face displaying exhilaration. The压抑 (repressed) years were swept away by this roar.

“Early Nascent Soul! At least I’ve regained some strength!” Tian Bo clenched his fists, a satisfied expression on his face.

“Congratulations, Elder Tian!” Luo Tian smiled warmly.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Tian Bo turned to the three of them, his face returning to its amiable demeanor: “I must thank you all for the elixirs. Otherwise, my old bones would have turned to dust!”

“Don’t thank me; by rank, I might even call you an elder!” Lu Kunpeng smiled warmly. Saving such a strength was a great achievement for him, and it further advanced his Dan Sect cultivation.

“From now on, if there’s anything you need, just say it. I’ll do my best to help!” Tian Bo bowed respectfully to the three of them.

Lu Kunpeng’s face lit up at Tian Bo’s words. Having a Nascent Soul strength in the Dan Sect was a significant boost to its power.

After some small talk, Tian Bo inquired about Gu Yun’s condition. The three of them then went to Gu Yun’s room. Upon discovering Gu Yun’s transformation, Tian Bo wore a delighted expression. When Luo Tian asked what had happened, Tian Bo merely smiled mysteriously and said nothing more.

The Gu family was overjoyed to see Tian Bo fully recovered and at Nascent Soul level. With Gu Yun confirmed unharmed, they all celebrated. Under the Gu family’s entreaties, Lu Kunpeng did not leave immediately and shared a meal with them.

Lu Kunpeng didn’t know why, but he clinked cups with the Gu family members.

However, halfway through the meal, Lu Kunpeng retrieved his jade token from his waist and wore a puzzled expression. He spoke to Luo Tian beside him: “The Sect Leader asked me to take you to the main peak!”

“Ah?” Luo Tian was puzzled. He didn’t know why Wei Mingxuan wanted to call him, but he could guess it might relate to the Yin Sect.

“Let’s go!” Lu Kunpeng’s face bore a heavy expression, clearly indicating this was no good for the Dan Sect.

Luo Tian nodded slightly and they bid farewell to the Gu family, heading toward the main peak of the Five Elements Sect.

“Kid, once we reach the main peak, leave everything to me. The Dan Sect will back you up. Don’t disgrace your master!” Lu Kunpeng warned on the way, clearly not believing this summons would benefit the Dan Sect.

“Hmph.” Luo Tian said nothing, as if deep in thought, merely giving a slight nod and falling silent behind Lu Kunpeng.

Not long after, they arrived at the main peak and entered its grand hall.

As soon as they stepped into the hall, they found other peak masters and elders seated with tense expressions.

Seeing Lu Kunpeng and Luo Tian arrive, everyone’s gaze turned to Luo Tian.

The Sect Leader Wei Mingxuan sat at the head, his face devoid of emotion as he sipped tea.

Lu Kunpeng’s gaze swept over the second position beneath Wei Mingxuan and noticed it was occupied by several peak masters, especially the Earth Peak master, who gazed at Lu Kunpeng with a hint of contempt.

For years, the Dan Sect had always been subordinate to the main peak, never daring to sit in the second position. Yet today, these people had occupied it—clearly a slap at the Dan Sect’s face.

Realizing this, Lu Kunpeng’s expression darkened as he clenched his fists and sat in the last position with Luo Tian, saying nothing. Luo Tian stood behind Lu Kunpeng, his face cold as he observed their intentions.

“Alright, now that everyone’s here, speak your minds!” Wei Mingxuan placed his teacup on the table and spoke calmly.

“Sect Leader, our disciples suffered heavy casualties in conflicts with the Yin Sect. We hope you can devise a solution!” The Gold Peak master spoke first.

“Yes! Why did the Dan Sect suffer no major losses while we did? I demand an explanation from Lu Elder!” The Earth Peak master Huang Jingshan said with a mocking tone.

“Hmph, Huang Jingshan, your head must’ve been kicked by a donkey. Always demanding explanations—your own lack of ability, yet you blame others?” Lu Kunpeng countered without backing down.

“Who did you say?” Huang Jingshan’s face reddened, but he was a peak master and an early Nascent Soul strength. Though Lu Kunpeng was a respected elder of the Dan Sect, he saw him as merely a late-stage bone-refining strength. From both cultivation and status, Huang Jingshan felt he dominated Lu Kunpeng.

Huang Jingshan hadn’t expected Lu Kunpeng to dare speak so openly.

Chapter 174: The Arrival of a Strong Adversary

“You!” Huang Jingshan stood up, pointing at Lu Kunpeng’s nose and staring intently.

“What did I do?” Lu Kunpeng remained calm, speaking clearly. His temper was already unkind, and he could not abide provocations.

“The Dan Sect is really domineering! A mere elder dares to defy a peak master!” Huang Jingshan sneered.

“Always so. If you don’t like it, try to hit me now! I’ve already banned Earth Peak’s elixirs for thirty years. You might as well give up and stop pretending!” Lu Kunpeng remained defiant.

Other peak masters saw the two clash immediately and wore expressions of amusement.

Luo Tian observed the other peak masters’ faces secretly, confirming they had no intention of intervening in this conflict.

“Enough! With the enemy at our gates, you’re fighting among yourselves!” Wei Mingxuan spoke, his gaze coldly sweeping over Huang Jingshan and Lu Kunpeng.

Hearing Wei Mingxuan’s words, neither dared to act recklessly. Huang Jingshan let out a cold snort and sat back down, knowing Wei Mingxuan’s presence made it impossible to escalate. Yet Lu Kunpeng’s words still angered him.

Behind Huang Jingshan, a gray-cloaked youth watched Luo Tian with interest, his gaze flickering with contemplation.

“With the Tianshi Sect’s issue unresolved, now comes the Yin Sect. What solutions do you have for this crisis?” Wei Mingxuan asked again, his gaze sweeping over the crowd.

“Sect Leader, I suggest surrendering Luo Tian to ease relations with the Yin Sect and contacting major sects to purge the Tianshi Sect!” Huang Jingshan spoke first.

“Surrender your mother’s ass!” A rough voice echoed from the door, three young figures appearing in sight.

“Who!” Huang Jingshan was facing Wei Mingxuan and hadn’t seen who spoke, but the bold curse made him furious. His eyes turned icy as he scanned the hall’s entrance.

Luo Tian recognized the voice and smiled slightly—it was too familiar. It was his second elder brother, Lei Yong. Months had passed since their last meeting, yet Lei Yong’s voice was even more thunderous now.

Lu Kunpeng heard the voice and wore a slight smile.

Other peak masters grimaced, looking at the man who dared curse Huang Jingshan. Even Wei Mingxuan’s lips twitched slightly.

Lei Yong’s voice was too sudden, echoing loudly in the vast hall and lingering for a long time.

“I!” Zhang Ziping spoke calmly, followed by Lei Yong and Ji Chen, their faces showing no emotion as they walked behind Zhang Ziping.

The three of them calmly strode forward, and the hall’s people watched as they approached the positions belonging to the peak masters.

“Who allowed you to sit here?” Zhang Ziping spoke calmly, his gaze sweeping over the peak masters with a cold glint.

“Sect Leader, Huang Jingshan insisted we sit here!” The peak masters quickly blamed Huang Jingshan.

Earth Peak had been banned from elixirs for thirty years by Zhang Ziping, and they did not wish to follow Earth Peak’s fate. Unlike Lu Kunpeng, Zhang Ziping was a true Dan Sect master.

The peak masters left their positions and moved back.

Huang Jingshan stood red-faced, not expecting Zhang Ziping to return so strongly. More importantly, Lei Yong had openly cursed him in front of all peak masters—this was a humiliation he hadn’t faced in years.

“Get out!” Zhang Ziping spoke calmly again, as if doing something ordinary.

“You!” Huang Jingshan was furious but had no choice but to stand there, his face twisted with rage. First Lu Kunpeng, then Lei Yong, now Zhang Ziping.

It was clear Huang Jingshan had been trampled by the Dan Sect today. He knew he couldn’t back down; if he did, his face would be completely ruined. He stood rigidly, his face contorted with rage.

“It’s not your position! Everyone here can sit!” Huang Jingshan spoke coldly.

“Three breaths! Otherwise, I’ll help you out!” Zhang Ziping spoke calmly.

“Enough! Stop fighting!” Wei Mingxuan’s voice rang out, his face stern.

Hearing Wei Mingxuan’s scolding, Zhang Ziping glanced at him deeply.

Wei Mingxuan also stared at Zhang Ziping for several breaths.

Zhang Ziping’s lips curled into a slight arc, and he patted Huang Jingshan’s shoulder: “Huang Peak Master, I’ll let you sit here.”

After saying this, Zhang Ziping turned and sat beside Lu Kunpeng. He glanced at Luo Tian, sensing his current cultivation level was eighth-stage body refinement but then noticed something about Luo Tian and his eyes lit up.

Seeing Zhang Ziping sit in the last position, Huang Jingshan felt a sigh of relief. He didn’t know if he could match Zhang Ziping, but the Dan Sect’s young people were terrifying—whether it was Zhang Ziping or Lei Yong, even Luo Tian was a rare talent.

As Zhang Ziping sat down, the hall fell silent again. The various bone-refining and Nascent Soul strength masters remained quiet, and the hall fell into another silence.

Wei Mingxuan was speechless at their actions, his face showing anger. He was about to explode but turned his gaze elsewhere with a solemn expression.

The crowd felt Wei Mingxuan’s abnormality and extended their mental awareness, their faces also showing solemnity.

Wei Mingxuan vanished from his spot, and pairs of energy wings appeared behind him, following Wei Mingxuan.

At that moment, two massive flying dragons appeared over the Five Elements Sect, their immense pressure radiating outward and pressing against the sect’s disciples.

“Hum…” A vast light screen blocked the dragons and their black-cloaked figures’ pressure.

“Haha, let me test this Five Elements Sect’s protective array!” A black-cloaked man stood on the dragon, his two golden wings emerging from his back—clearly a Nascent Soul strength.

The black-cloaked man’s face bore fierce battle intent, golden light gathering into his fists. He stood on the dragon’s back without moving and directly attacked the rising screen.

The golden fist carried immense power, emitting a piercing hum as if tearing through space, striking the rising screen.

Chapter 175: Conditions

“Pang…” A deep sound echoed across the Five Elements Sect.

Some ordinary disciples felt the powerful energy waves above and wore expressions of fear, knowing the Yin Sect had returned. They had come once before half a month ago but hadn’t attacked the sect’s protective array then.

“Excellent!” The black-cloaked man said, observing the Five Elements Sect’s protective array merely trembling slightly.

“Grand Elder truly has mastered nature! Even the Five Elements Sect’s protective array can be shaken!” A praising voice echoed, and those on the dragon’s back cheered loudly.

“Enough! Don’t forget today’s purpose!” A black-cloaked elder spoke to the black-cloaked man.

Hearing this, even the initial attacker nodded slightly.

“Too much! The Yin Sect is determined to fight us?” The Five Elements Sect disciples were furious, as attacking another sect’s protective array was extremely impolite—equivalent to insulting the attacked sect.

“Du Yongchang! Are you determined to fight us to the death?” Wei Mingxuan’s furious voice rang out.

The figures from the main hall appeared above the Five Elements Sect, their overwhelming presence pressing against the two dragons.

“Roar!” The dragons howled and could not withstand the pressure, their massive bodies falling.

As the dragons fell several feet, the black-cloaked people on them also faced off, their overwhelming presence emerging from them. A faint but fierce killing intent was felt.

Two forces clashed, and in an instant, the two groups of strong cultivators faced off silently.

“Roar…” At this moment, the Five Elements Sect’s disciples gathered together—tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. Under each peak master’s arrangement, they stood orderly, emitting a faint battle intent from their bodies.

The saying “many ants can devour an elephant” was vividly demonstrated here, as the combined strength of these disciples surpassed even the two groups. A powerful aura surged skyward, crushing the dragons.

“Damn it!” Du Yongchang’s face changed. He had forgotten that the Five Elements Sect was known for its numbers, and this was their home ground. Clearly, they were at a disadvantage.

“Pang…” The two dragons’ massive bodies emitted a deep sound as they fell into the Five Elements Sect.

“Self-inflicted!” The Five Elements Sect disciples wore expressions of satisfaction at the dragons’ massive forms.

Though the dragons had fallen, those on them were unharmed. However, losing their momentum made their faces grim.

“Du Yongchang, what’s your purpose? If you intend to attack us, then all of you will stay here!” Wei Mingxuan’s face showed satisfaction as the dragons fell, gazing down at the Yin Sect’s people.

“Hmph! Wei Mingxuan, I’ve come to resolve this conflict. I assume you don’t want it to continue?” Du Yongchang refused to look up at Wei Mingxuan, his black wings extending again and returning to the sky.

“Oh? How so? What’s your solution?” Wei Mingxuan remained calm, watching Du Yongchang. He knew Du Yongchang was impatient; despite the Five Elements Sect’s heavy losses, it still had a deeper foundation than the Yin Sect. Moreover, the Yin Sect was sparse in numbers. Considering the ratio of the two sects, it would be the Yin Sect that suffered most.

“Simple—hand over this boy named Luo Tian, and we’ll be at peace. One disciple for the Five Elements Sect’s safety. This deal isn’t bad, is it?” Du Yongchang thought of the pressure from his sect’s elders and wore a sinister expression, scanning the Five Elements Sect crowd for the one already returned to the sect.

Hearing Du Yongchang’s words, the Five Elements Sect disciples wore expressions of disappointment. Who was Luo Tian? He was a direct disciple of the Dan Sect’s Grand Elder. If they handed him over, they believed the entire Dan Sect might defect from the Five Elements Sect.

“This topic is off-limits. If a sect needs one disciple to secure its safety, then it has no right to exist.” Wei Mingxuan’s face bore solemnity, as if speaking to Du Yongchang but the Five Elements Sect disciples knew this was for them.
