"After so many generations, my bloodline has weakened to this extent!" Tu Tian shook his head, a wistful expression on his face. He extended a hand, and the blood essence within the crimson space suddenly condensed into a terrifying vortex, gradually forming a single deep red drop of blood in the hands of the Blood Lord.

"This..." Luotian felt the space's blood essence condense under Tu Tian's control, becoming strangely dry. His eyes widened in shock.

"Don't be surprised. This blood essence within the crimson space was originally my own drop of refined blood!" Tu Tian let out a light laugh, then implanted the deep red blood into Tu Feiyang's body.

After that drop of blood entered Tu Feiyang's body, a powerful resonance immediately erupted within him. A formidable aura formed around his body, and the previously withered Tu Feiyang rapidly recovered, astonishing Luotian.

"The blood of a World Emperor is an unparalleled sacred medicine. It can revive the dead and mend broken bones! This legend was truly real!" Luotian marveled internally, gazing at the somewhat intangible projection with even greater reverence.

"Human race. Tell me, how did you obtain the World Scripture? This scripture has always appeared within my Ancient Ten Thousand Clans. How did it end up in the hands of humans?" Tu Tian's authoritative gaze swept over Luotian.

"This..." Luotian's face broke out in cold sweat, unsure how to respond. He couldn't say that your Ancient Ten Thousand Clans were destroyed and sealed within a star domain by the Lord of Sealing Heaven, that the world had already changed.

"Hmm?" Tu Tian's authoritative gaze turned to Luotian, his eyes filled with confusion before furrowing slightly.

When Tu Tian's gaze swept over him, Luotian's entire body trembled. His eyes met the Blood Lord's profound gaze before suddenly becoming hazy, as if he had fallen into a crimson ocean. A cold atmosphere enveloped him.

Chapter 1277: The True Inheritance

Luotian felt himself in a state of confusion, as if he had fallen into a crimson vortex, sinking into coldness and solitude.

"Ah! So the human race has risen!" Tu Tian murmured softly, then withdrew his gaze, becoming profound. He let out a long sigh.

As Tu Tian's gaze receded, Luotian instantly regained his clarity. He stood in the void, eyes filled with disbelief as he gazed at Tiatian.

"He probed my memories!" Luotian was overwhelmed with shock, utterly stunned by Tu Tian's technique. He knew that Tu Tian's method wasn't soul-searching.

"Ultimately, it happened. Oppression inevitably brings resistance. The oppression from the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans against humans was truly harsh!" Tu Tian murmured softly, then gazed at Luotian.

"You're quite remarkable. Your bloodline is powerful enough to rival my younger self, and you have the World Scripture. It's certain that this era's World Emperor will be none other than you!" Tu Tian smiled, gazing at Luotian.

"Senior, aren't you going to kill me to clear the path for future generations?" Luotian's heart stirred, and he quickly bowed respectfully before Tu Tian.

"Ugh... what use is it to kill you? The path must be walked by oneself. Do I need to clear out everyone else?"

"Besides, when you reach a certain level, some things will seem much more distant and clear!" Tu Tian's face showed a hint of emotion as he gazed at Tu Feiyang, shaking his head slightly.

Hearing Tu Tian's words, Luotian was stunned. This was the symbol of true invincibility—walking one's own path.

"You humans' so-called World Emperors must have been like this, rising through their own strength!" Tu Tian's eyes showed a touch of melancholy, leaving Luotian in deep admiration.

"Invincibility! That feeling can only be understood by reaching the level of Tu Tian himself!" Luotian sighed inwardly.

"Senior, I have a question. The World Emperor is also your clan's kings, what is their final destination?" Luotian bowed respectfully and asked the question that had long been his greatest confusion, as well as the mystery of all nine domains and the tenth origin domain.

"I don't know. I'm just a lingering thought. As for my true self, whether it's alive or dead, I don't know. Perhaps it has died, perhaps it has become an immortal!" Tu Tian murmured softly, gazing into the distance.

"Immortals!" Luotian trembled again. He hadn't expected this apparition of Tu Tian to mention immortals.

What did "immortals" represent? Luotian didn't know, but he knew that since ancient times, no one had ever discovered the existence of immortals. Even World Emperors never claimed to be immortal.

"Immortals... perhaps they exist. I can sense that my true self had touched that level of attainment, but whether it succeeded or not, I don't know!" Tu Tian spoke softly, as if sensing Luotian's confusion.

Luotian's heart was in turmoil. If immortals truly existed, would they also possess eternal life? This forbidden secret that even World Emperors and clan kings had failed to break since ancient times.

"You still have a long road ahead. I can sense that you're quite extraordinary. If my true self is still alive, perhaps we might meet in the future!" Tu Tian spoke, his voice fading.

"Enough. Walk your own path. Since ancient times, no empire has remained eternally prosperous. Our clans are like this, and so is the human race!" Tu Tian spoke, then his illusory figure soared into the air.

"If this palace has opened, then let's reveal the true inheritance site! Who will inherit my legacy depends on your own fortune!" A powerful voice echoed through the vast, empty space.

"Boom..." As Tu Tian's voice faded, his illusory figure shattered with a thunderous explosion, transforming into waves of violent blood essence that swept through the entire space, filling it once more with blood essence.

Rumbling...

The crimson palace trembled violently. A massive sea of blood condensed into a vast vortex, countless waves of blood surged backward and were sucked into the palace.

As the blood waves receded, the Sea's Corner also began to tremble. A colossal wave of blood crashed onto the high platform.

"What's happening!" At the human clan's encampment on Qixing Island, Hu Tianzong and Yang Jinghua's faces changed abruptly. They felt a terrifying suction pulling at their bodies, eyes filled with disbelief.

Not only did the human clan's encampment experience this, but so did the蛮族 (Barbarian) clan's. Both sides were discussing how to face the upcoming major battle when, in the hall, Man Hun, Fu Xingyue, and Fan Jingyu's faces changed abruptly as they felt the massive suction.

"Ah..." Before people could react, all humans and Barbarians in the Sea's Corner were sucked into the blood ocean.

"You and this boy entered first, giving you some advantage. What I left behind as inheritance is divided into two parts. One part is this space, where blood essence condenses into a single drop of refined blood. This drop contains my insights over the years. I believe this boy will need a long time to refine it, so he won't compete with you for the other half of the inheritance."

"Your task is to obtain the inheritance through combat. Of course, as the firstcomer, I can give you some advantage!" A low voice echoed in Luotian's mind. It was Tu Tian.

"Control of the Corpse Technique!" Luotian's eyes lit up. He gazed at the white-haired zombie, and Tu Tian's voice echoed in his mind, transmitting the Control of the Corpse Technique to Luotian.

"Go on. Fight. If you can obtain my other half of the inheritance, it would mean a connection with me and a great karmic bond!" Tu Tian's voice gradually faded into the vast crimson space.

"Karma!" Luotian murmured softly, his eyes showing hesitation. The word "karma" made him feel uneasy.

"Who cares about karma? If I'm invincible, I'll shatter all karmic bonds with a single punch!" Luotian hesitated for a moment, then his eyes showed determination.

As Tu Tian's voice faded away, the vast empty space trembled violently and finally shattered. A wide ancient path appeared in Luotian's line of sight.

"Buzz..." Golden light flared before Luotian, and the残页 (fragment) of the World Scripture glowed brilliantly. It then suddenly shot into Luotian's mind, merging with the World Scripture within his consciousness. Finally, it hovered silently in Luotian's mind.

"Another fusion?" Luotian smiled slightly and shook his head. The World Scripture seemed even more mysterious in his eyes.

As Luotian sighed, a group of figures suddenly appeared before him, startling Luotian.

"What's going on? Where are we?" A group of figures looked around in confusion, their eyes filled with disbelief as they gazed at the thick blood essence surrounding them.

"Human race!"

"Barbarian clan!" Soon after, both sides saw each other. A tense atmosphere spread among the people.

"Luotian!" They soon noticed Luotian standing there, their eyes filled with confusion.

"You came!" Luotian's eyes showed a slight smile. He gazed at Hu Tianzong and Yang Jinghua, speaking softly.

"Where are we?" Hu Tianzong asked, while Yang Jinghua quickly organized the Qixing Island's personnel.

"Yes, Deputy Island Master. I was eating hotpot when suddenly a suction pulled me over!" Shen Gongfei squeezed through the crowd, still holding chopsticks. His face showed disbelief as he spoke to Luotian.

"What happened to Tu Feiyang?" Fu Xingyue, Man Hun, and Fan Jingyu's faces changed instantly. They saw Tu Feiyang lying there surrounded by blood essence.

" This is my inheritance site!" As everyone was confused, Tu Tian's voice echoed in their ears again.

"Inheritance. Whose inheritance?" Hearing Tu Tian's voice, everyone was exhilarated. They hadn't expected there to be an inheritance within this blood ocean.

"Blood Lord Tu Tian of the Blood Clan!" Luotian spoke softly, his voice carrying a touch of reverence. He gazed at the fading blood essence and directly announced Tu Tian's name.

"Tu Tian!"

Hearing Luotian's words, the entire crimson space trembled. Everyone's breath became slightly hurried. Their eyes were instantly burning with intensity.

Tu Tian! The ruler of the Blood Clan among the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans. Who didn't know him? His inheritance was irresistible to anyone!

"Yes, I am the ruler of the Blood Clan, Tu Tian. That path is the only way to enter my inheritance site!" Tu Tian's voice rose in everyone's minds.

"But if you want to obtain it, you must fight! Because only one person can enter the true inheritance site!" Tu Tian's voice echoed in everyone's minds.

"Fight! Since ancient times, the path to enlightenment is paved with bones. Who can obtain it depends on your own fortune!" Tu Tian's voice completely faded, leaving a group of breathless Barbarians and humans.

"My inheritance. No one can take it from me!" Fu Xingyue's body flashed, becoming a streak of light. He rushed toward the blood-colored path.

"See who's lucky!" Fan Jingyu's wings flapped, matching Fu Xingyue's speed.

"Regardless of anything, they can't get it!" Hu Tianzong held a gray spear and unleashed his speed. He arrived later but was no slower than Fu Xingyue or Fan Jingyu.

"Thinking I'm a pushover?!" Luotian's body transformed into a streak of white light and rushed onto the blood-colored path.

"Die!" Fu Xingyue and Fan Jingyu felt the presence of Hu Tianzong and Luotian behind them. Their faces changed abruptly. They knew that if they raced, they wouldn't be able to match Luotian and Hu Tianzong. After reaching the blood-colored path, they suddenly turned back to attack them.

"Then let's start this battle early! The victor will obtain Tu Tian's inheritance!" Man Hun shouted, gazing at Yang Jinghua of the human race. His thunderous voice echoed through the vast space.

Chapter 1278: The Battle Begins Early

"You want to fight? Then fight! I'm not afraid of you!" Yang Jinghua, though only at the threshold of the World Scripture, spoke with a strong tone. Even facing the first prodigy of the Barbarian clan, Man Hun, he showed no fear.

"Only you?" Man Long's face bore contempt. He gazed at Yang Jinghua and the numerous elite disciples of Qixing Island behind him.

"Roar..." Hearing Man Long's words, the remaining giants of the Barbarian clan let out a deafening roar. Although their numbers had decreased by a third, they still radiated an overwhelming battle spirit as if born for war.

"Kill!" The elite disciples of Qixing Island showed no signs of backing down. They stood in unison behind Yang Jinghua, letting out a low growl as their aura surged.

An invisible wave spread from both sides. They collided, and before the battle even began, they were already locked in a silent standoff.

"Then let's fight!" Man Hun took the lead, his massive body taking a step forward toward Yang Jinghua.

"Comrades, lend me your battle spirit!" Yang Jinghua smiled slightly and addressed the disciples behind him.

"Yes!" A unified voice rose in the crimson space. The elite disciples of Qixing Island roared, their bodies emitting waves of power. Their immense battle spirit surged into Yang Jinghua's body.

This overwhelming battle spirit entering Yang Jinghua's body caused his aura to surge violently. He immediately reached the threshold of the World Scripture's initial stage. Then, a clear sound echoed within his body as if breaking through some barrier. His power surged again, directly entering the initial stage of the World Scripture.

This was Yang Jinghua's most powerful secret weapon. By fusing with the terrifying battle spirit, he transformed it into his own strength.

"Using external power to reach the initial stage of the World Scripture. You still dare to fight me?" Man Hun's face showed contempt as he extended his massive foot, like golden cast iron. It seemed to be able to suppress everything. The "Benevolent God's Step of Nine Heavens" was launched, and he stomped down toward Yang Jinghua.

"Buzz..." The crimson sword landed in Yang Jinghua's hand. Its blood-colored blade pierced into the wild blood essence, instantly colliding with the golden foot.

"Kill!" Their battle ignited the entire battlefield. Man Long's massive body took a step forward, his half-World Scripture strength radiating toward the Qixing Island disciples.

"Can't withstand it. The gap is too big. The remaining eight prodigies of the Barbarian clan have three at half-World Scripture level, but we don't!" Xiang Shaochuan's face was grim. He gazed at Man Long and the others.

The Barbarian clan's giants' eyes turned red. They immediately rushed toward the human race, with eight prodigies leading the charge. If nothing unexpected happened, one attack would be enough to crush the human race.

"Remote combat techniques!" Xiang Shaochuan shouted, raising his golden spear and slashing toward the roaring Barbarian giants that could collapse the heavens.

The Qixing Island disciples also showed coldness. Their hands flashed with radiant light, and a wave of combat techniques flew from the ten thousand elite disciples. The sound of explosions filled the air.

Each technique carried a massive surge, charging toward the giant Barbarians like bulls.

"Flies challenging trees!" Man Long and others showed contempt. Their bodies radiated golden light, unafraid of the overwhelming combat techniques. They crashed through thousands of techniques.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." The explosions echoed, each technique colliding with Man Long's body. However, they were instantly dispersed by the Barbarian clan's powerful flesh, offering no resistance at all.

"Form the Heaven-Connecting Array!" Xiang Shaochuan's face showed madness. Though he knew they were no match, he refused to sit and wait for death. He shouted at the people behind him.

Hearing Xiang Shaochuan's words, the elite disciples of Qixing Island also showed madness. Their auras surged, and holy power and superhuman strength condensed from their bodies.

"Boom..." A golden ancient path instantly formed, as if a road to the heavens. Ten thousand people became one, with Xiang Shaochuan standing at the center of the path, his face cold.

"Suppress!" Xiang Shaochuan shouted softly. With an overwhelming aura, the ancient path radiated a terrifying presence and crashed down toward the rushing Barbarian giants.

"This is the human race's formation? Even I feel a sense of danger!" Man Long didn't stop his body. With the sound of thunder, he suddenly lifted his massive foot and stomped down toward the Heaven-Connecting ancient path.

Man Jiang, Man Hai, and other half-World Scripture level masters also did the same. As four prodigies of the Barbarian clan's Heaven-Connecting Hall, they unleashed their "Benevolent Seven Steps," which had already become invincible.

"Boom..." Luotian punched back Fan Jingyu, interrupting the battlefield between both sides. His face suddenly changed.

"Four half-World Scripture level masters. For the human race, it's a devastating blow. The Heaven-Connecting Array is indeed miraculous, capable of neutralizing an attack from the initial stage of the World Scripture. But it's only a neutralization, and after that, the entire ancient path will also collapse!" Luotian muttered to himself. He suddenly pointed his finger.

White rune chains flew from Luotian's fingers, heading toward the lifeless white-haired zombie.

"Stop those four half-World Scripture level masters!" Luotian coldly ordered, using the corpse control technique left by the Blood Lord to command the white-haired zombie.

"Roar..." Cold energy surged from the white-haired zombie, freezing time around it. Red eyes flashed with an eerie red light. The white-haired zombie instantly appeared before Man Long and the others, his dry hands clenching into fists and charging toward them.

"What is this thing!" Man Long's group suddenly changed faces. They felt suffocated, their hearts trembling at the white-haired zombie's formidable flesh strength.

"This is a blood clan's corpse. It's dead, how could it appear here? And it's even at the middle stage of the World Scripture!" Man Long growled, not daring to delay. He redirected his massive foot from stepping onto the Heaven-Connecting ancient path and stomped toward the white-haired zombie.

Man Jiang, Man Hai, and another half-World Scripture level prodigy of the Barbarian clan's Heaven-Connecting Hall did the same. The pressure from the white-haired zombie was too great for them.

"Suppress!" Seeing Man Long's group being suppressed by the white-haired zombie, Xiang Shaochuan at the center of the array suddenly brightened his eyes. He shouted to the disciples within the array.

The explosions echoed, and the Heaven-Connecting ancient path instantly crashed into the remaining Barbarian clan members. A series of crackling sounds rose throughout the space.

Blood and flesh scattered, each massive body was crushed by the ancient path. None had a chance to resist, being instantly shattered into blood mist floating beneath the crimson space.

"Ah..." A scream echoed. Each Barbarian giant's eyes showed intense fear, gazing at the people within the blood-stained ancient path. They couldn't understand how the human race, who were weaker in combat power, could unleash such formidable strength.

"Damn!" Man Hun's face was grim. He watched the massive ancient path continuing to crush the Barbarian clan members, his eyes showing a touch of madness.

"Get out..." Man Hun roared, stomping down with his golden foot onto Yang Jinghua's body. Yang Jinghua had only reached the initial stage of the World Scripture through special methods, and he was facing Man Hun, the first prodigy of the Barbarian clan's Heaven-Connecting Hall. Therefore, he had been struggling to maintain his position. At this moment, Man Hun's anger made it impossible for Yang Jinghua to withstand.

The golden foot was like a mountain, causing Yang Jinghua's crimson sword to break. He spat out blood and was sent flying backward.

"Ten Thousand Gods Retreat with the Fourth Step of Benevolent God!" Man Hun knew that if he didn't break through this human race's array, the Barbarian clan's losses would be even more severe. So he took his fourth step.

"Crack..." The next moment, like the arrival of a benevolent god, a massive leg shadow collided with the Heaven-Connecting ancient path. A thunderous sound of breaking echoed.

"Pu..." Xiang Shaochuan's face turned red. His eyes dimmed, and he spat out a mouthful of blood. The entire Heaven-Connecting ancient path was completely destroyed by Man Hun's furious step, and the human race's figures scattered from within the array.

"Barbarian clan warriors! The human race's array has been broken. Follow me and attack!" Man Hun roared, like a pillar of spirit for the Barbarian clan. His roar reignited the strong battle spirit in the Barbarians who had already considered retreat. They pounded their shoulders heavily and charged toward the human race again.

"At this point, fight!" Yang Jinghua stood in the sky. His crimson sword returned to his hand. He roared and rushed toward Man Hun again.

The cries of battle echoed, and both sides clashed like two rivers. This time, it wasn't the Barbarian clan being crushed but a battle of equals.

In another battlefield, Luotian's group also continuously produced explosions. The powerful waves seemed about to break the entire crimson ancient path.

Luotian unintentionally faced Fan Jingyu of the Bird Clan, while Hu Tianzong fought against Fu Xingyue.

"Luotian, last time you ran so desperately. This time there's no heavenly disaster to help you. I want to see what talent you truly have!" Fan Jingyu continuously fought with Luotian, constantly mocking him. However, he was also shocked by Luotian's strength.

"Only you?" Luotian punched out, continuously clashing with Fan Jingyu. At the same time, he was secretly amazed by Fan Jingyu's methods. Each punch could wound him, but Fan Jingyu seemed to have a way of dispersing the force, making it feel like he was hitting cotton.

Chapter 1279: The Fifth Step

The crimson space saw the human race and Barbarian clan fighting each other. Thunderous explosions echoed throughout the crimson space, with many strong warriors from both sides dying and making the blood essence even denser.

The battlefield's outcome mainly depended on Luotian and other prodigies. On the crimson ancient path, explosions continued. Hu Tianzong and Fu Xingyue exchanged blows. Although Hu Tianzong had just reached the initial stage of the World Scripture, his speed was even faster than Fu Xingyue, a prodigy of the Ancient Ten Thousand Clans.

At the same time, Luotian faced a formidable opponent. Without heavenly disaster assistance, Fan Jingyu's strength was evident. They continuously clashed without falling behind, and even his physical collision only slightly lagged behind, as he had a special method to counter Luotian's formidable physical strength.

"Damn!" Fan Jingyu marveled at Luotian's perfection. His body was strong, his World Scripture power was formidable, and his soul was equally powerful—there were no weaknesses at all.

"Buzz..." Fan Jingyu retreated, and a series of white feathers transformed into exquisite divine swords. The sword intent was terrifying, as if it could split the heavens and cut through endless blood essence, charging toward Luotian.

Luotian had no suitable weapon at the moment. He could only use his physical strength to resist, like a supreme warrior, continuously throwing punches and using two great techniques to neutralize Fan Jingyu's attacks.

"Since physical strength can't beat you, I'll use combat techniques to defeat you!" Luotian's eyes gleamed. He raised his hand, and the Divine King Nine Heavens Map erupted, collapsing space. A terrifying pressure made Fan Jingyu's face change.

"Daydreaming!" Fan Jingyu sneered, his voice carrying contempt. He waved his hands, and a series of white World Scripture power flowed like holy light over him, making him appear sacred, like a true god.

"Nameless Emperor's Sword!" Fan Jingyu roared. As his voice fell, thunder echoed. However, no actual sword intent emerged. But within Luotian's spiritual sense, an invisible sword intent flew out from his hand.

In a flash, the invisible sword intent collided with the Divine King Nine Heavens Map. The invisible waves made the entire battlefield pause.

"How many times can you withstand it?" Luotian's eyes showed a hint of mockery. He gazed at Fan Jingyu and suddenly flew upward. At the same time, a golden foot formed, radiating a wild aura and descending toward Fan Jingyu.

"Benevolent God's Fifth Step!" Luotian's voice was loud, and his entire body turned golden, like a god descending from heaven.

"It's the Benevolent Seven Steps. He learned it so quickly!" Man Hun, who was fighting against Yang Jinghua, looked grim and dark. His eyes were filled with intense disbelief.

"How quickly he learned the Benevolent Seven Steps?" The faces of Man Jiang and Man Hai, who were struggling under the white-haired zombie's pressure, also showed disbelief.

"Luotian has learned the Barbarian clan's combat technique!" Not only did the Barbarians show bewilderment, but so did the humans. Due to racial differences, it was difficult for humans to learn other Ancient Ten Thousand Clans' combat techniques or arts. Like when Luotian first arrived at the Barbarian clan's land, and Chu Chen gave him to practice the Barbarian clan's arts. But Luotian had no reaction at all.

Faced with the Benevolent Seven Steps, Fan Jingyu's face changed abruptly. This was a famous combat technique of the Barbarian clan, known alongside curse techniques. Fan Jingyu feared it greatly.

"Luotian's body is naturally strong, and with the enhancement of the Benevolent Seven Steps on his body, plus two killing techniques he has mastered, this technique is already at its peak!" Hu Tianzong and Fu Xingyue's fight also felt the descending golden foot.

"Even stronger than Man Hun's first step!" As the target of the attack, Fan Jingyu felt it directly. In the moment the golden foot formed, he knew that this step was at least three times stronger than Man Hun's first step.

"Ah... I, the Bird Clan, also have a legendary combat technique. Do you think I can't defeat you?"

"Fei Wang's Six Cuts!" Fan Jingyu summoned an exquisite divine sword, emitting a terrifying sword intent. It formed a massive column of light that could cut through the heavens, charging toward Luotian's golden foot.

"It's time to decide the outcome!" Although people on the battlefield were still fighting, they diverted part of their attention to Luotian and Fan Jingyu's battle.

Sword intent spread, World Scripture power surged. Under the amazement of people, the golden foot collided with the terrifying sword intent and exploded, neutralizing each other.

"Even if I took only one step, it's impossible to eliminate this prodigy like Fan Jingyu!" Luotian showed no concern. He knew that taking only one step wouldn't be enough to eliminate Fan Jingyu, a prodigy.

Luotian didn't hold back. He immediately took the second and third steps, his aura resounding with power. Two golden feet descended one after another, attacking Fan Jingyu.

"Fei Wang's Six Cuts, Destroy Form!"

"Fei Wang's Six Cuts, Rainbow Fly!" Fan Jingyu obviously put everything into it. Two golden sword intent waves were shot out by his royal-cultivated divine sword, carrying the power to destroy heaven and earth. They collided with the two golden feet.

"Boom... Boom..." Two thunderous explosions echoed, shaking all superhuman-level warriors in the crimson space. They were all knocked to their knees, coughing blood and pale-faced as if wounded.

"Who is this demon? He learned the third step so quickly!" The Barbarian clan was completely shocked. The third step of the Benevolent Seven Steps, even among the ten prodigies of the Barbarian clan's Heaven-Connecting Hall, no more than five could take it. Yet Luotian had taken the third step in just a few days.

"Cough... Cough..." Fan Jingyu's face was pale, coughing up two mouthfuls of blood. He then took deep breaths, his eyes showing madness.

"The third step should be your limit. But I can take the fourth!" Fan Jingyu clenched his hand around the divine sword, which emitted a continuous humming sound.

Thinking of this, Fan Jingyu wiped his hand over the golden sword intent. A red light flashed, and golden divine blood stained the golden sword.

In an instant, a terrifying aura surged. The golden sword, after absorbing Fan Jingyu's blood, suddenly changed color and became a bloodthirsty sword.

"Fei Wang's Six Cuts, Bloodthirsty!" Fan Jingyu's face showed a sinister expression. The red light illuminated his body, making him appear strangely beautiful and changing his aura completely.

"Buzz..." The sword sound echoed. The bloodthirsty sword intent, carrying an overwhelming wave, charged toward Luotian with the sound of a demon's sword.

"Who said I couldn't take the fourth step?" Luotian's eyes showed mockery. He stood in the void, raised his leg and took a slow step forward.

"Benevolent God's Fourth Step, All Gods Retreat!" The light voice came from Luotian. However, it made the entire battlefield pause instantly. Everyone's eyes were filled with intense shock, even forgetting their opponents as they stared at the golden foot slowly forming and took a deep breath.

"He actually managed to take the fourth step!" Man Long's group shouted in surprise, their hearts trembling. They were also bitter and sad. They hadn't expected a human to be able to take the fourth step of the Benevolent Seven Steps.

The sound of the Dao echoed. Two legendary combat techniques collided with a violent wave, making even Luotian feel unstable on his feet.

Fan Jingyu was no better. He spat out blood and flew back a thousand feet before stopping, his eyes filled with disbelief.

"I not only can take the fourth step. I can also take the fifth!" Luotian's eyes showed a calm expression as he gazed at Fan Jingyu. He spoke softly, and at the same time, one leg lifted again.

"Benevolent God's Fifth Step, Shake the World!" The clear voice echoed in everyone's hearts. At the same time, Luotian's fifth step crashed down.

The Dao patterns spread out. The entire crimson void trembled as if it couldn't withstand Luotian's foot. Wherever the golden foot went, space began to collapse, absorbing a large amount of blood essence before quickly healing.

Man Hun's face showed bitterness. He looked at the golden foot, which could take the fifth step, enough to show that Luotian was much stronger than him.

This step shook the heavens and earth!

This step was nearly invincible!

This step could kill a World Scripture initial stage master!

It seemed that the entire world had only Luotian's foot, like a true Benevolent God extending one massive foot to suppress the nine heavens and ten earths.

Fan Jingyu's face turned pale. He knew that he couldn't withstand this fifth step. A terrifying pressure instantly descended upon him, and with his World Scripture initial stage strength, he was even slightly unable to move.

"Golden Feather Armor!" Fan Jingyu's eyes showed madness. Facing death, he finally revealed his ultimate secret weapon—the imitation of the royal weapon given by the Bird Clan.

The golden feather armor instantly appeared on Fan Jingyu's body. Each golden feather radiated brilliant gold light, and one of them was particularly outstanding, radiating a royal aura. This feather was from the wing of the Bird Clan's former ruler.

"Boom..." As the golden feather armor just covered Fan Jingyu's body, the golden foot also crashed down and struck Fan Jingyu's body. This caused Fan Jingyu to fall, blood spewing from his mouth continuously. His body also emitted a series of cracking sounds, clearly indicating that his bones had broken.

The golden feather armor shattered as Fan Jingyu fell. Golden feathers scattered around and then disintegrated. Fan Jingyu's body also crashed onto the crimson ancient path, as if it could break the path.

"Roar..." Fan Jingyu used his last breath to point his finger. A drop of refined blood flew out and landed on the most prominent feather, which was once part of the Bird Clan's ruler.

Chapter 1280: The Transformation of Shen Gongfei

The golden refined blood stained the golden feather, emitting a series of humming sounds. It then suddenly expanded and transformed into a small golden boat that instantly appeared before Fan Jingyu. Without hesitation, Fan Jingyu lay on the golden boat with his wounded body and sailed through the crimson void, disappearing from everyone's sight.

"Escape... He escaped..." People stared in disbelief as the space cracks slowly healed.

"Roar..." The human side roared, their eyes burning with intensity as they gazed at Luotian. Fan Jingyu's escape meant that their side had gained an additional World Scripture initial stage master. Considering Luotian's combat power, he was clearly stronger than Man Hun and Fu Xingyue.

With Luotian added to their side, the battle's outcome could be completely reversed. Thus, the most difficult battle since the Sea's Corner opened would ultimately result in a human race victory.

"Man Hun, surrender. Your side has lost!" Yang Jinghua, covered in blood, shouted at Man Hun. He had clearly suffered serious injuries.

"Did he escape?" Luotian's eyebrows slightly furrowed. He sighed inwardly, thinking these clan prodigies were truly hard to kill with so many tricks.

Then Luotian looked at Hu Tianzong and Fu Xingyue's battlefield. Their movements were also significant, but they couldn't determine the outcome.

"Then I'll take this inheritance of the Blood Lord!" Luotian's eyes showed a touch of confidence. At this moment, no one in the entire crimson space could block him except for Tu Feiyang, who was continuously merging with Tu Tian's drop of refined blood.
