“Get out of my sight…” The Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King turned deathly pale, roaring again. His hands moved rapidly, and一道道 patterns of the savage realm flickered forth, appearing on his arms. He pushed forward with this overwhelming aura against the world-shaking presence.

In an instant, blood splattered, and a vast mist of crimson obscured the view. Everyone instinctively trembled.

Chapter 1475 had finally arrived.

Divine blood imbued with the essence of the wilds rained down upon the starry void. Everyone’s faces were etched with awe, their gazes filled with disbelief.

As the blood mist scattered, people discerned the battle scene. The Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King's massive body had been shattered nearly in half.

“Even the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King was shattered!” The people of the Ancient Clans trembled, watching the fading aura.

“This is true divine power!” The people of the Human Realm displayed intense fear in their eyes.

The Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King was a master of the flesh, unmatched throughout history. Even he had clashed with the legendary Zhongli Tian and perished together in a mutual destruction.

Yet now, he had been reduced to this state by a single aura—something no one could have anticipated.

“Kill!” Lu Tian’s eyes gleamed with joy. The combined strength of three auras had yielded results beyond his expectations. He darted forward, seizing this golden opportunity as the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King began to coalesce.

Roars echoed. Though the Candidate King was in disarray, his immense body rapidly regenerated the half he had lost.

“Damn it!” The Candidate King’s face twisted with fury, yet his complexion was pale—clearly wounded.

“Buzz…” A golden sword slashed again. Zhong Zixuan joined Lu Tian, charging toward the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King.

“You still aren’t my match!” The Candidate King roared, striking with wild abandon against Lu Tian and Zhongli Tian.

Meanwhile, Gu Tianshu clashed against four Candidate Kings. He was still holding his ground. The battle had reached a brief equilibrium, and the thunderous roars and cascading divine radiance made people realize how terrifying their combat was.

The Human Realm’s people gazed at Lu Tian and Zhong Zixuan with reverence. At this crucial moment, the two had stepped forward to aid Gu Tianshu in fending off one Candidate King. Their role was pivotal.

“Please don’t summon any more Candidate Kings!” Sun Kemin muttered, watching the life-and-death struggle.

“Sun Kemin, shut your mouth!” Upon hearing his words, Diao Dedu and others’ faces darkened.

“Boom…” Before their voices had faded, a series of thunderous roars echoed again in the starry void.

“Things are getting lively,” a light laugh resonated in their ears, accompanied by an unusual tone. A venerable old man clad in golden robes emerged from the Thunder Domain, his eyes filled with amusement as he gazed at the combatants.

“Ah! It’s a Candidate King from the Crimson Phoenix Clan!” Someone immediately recognized him, their eyes wide with shock.

“My heavens! Even this fossil-level Candidate King was awakened!” The people of the Ancient Clans bore expressions of reverence toward the golden-robed elder.

“This is truly over!” People gazed at the golden-robed old man, despairing. Another Candidate King had appeared—how could the Human Realm possibly contend?

Moreover, as soon as the golden-robed elder arrived, a host of powerful figures emerged from the Thunder Domain. Nine Epoch Peak masters stood before them.

“This is truly over!” The Human Realm’s hearts sank to the depths. With nine Epoch Peak masters standing alongside Fu Wenbin, Lao Sama, and the elder Crimson Phoenix, the number of Epoch Peak masters among the Ancient Clans had surged to seventeen.

“Human Realm is too weak!” The nine newly arrived Epoch Peak masters sneered, their gazes filled with contempt.

“Only one Candidate Epoch Lord remains?” The golden-robed elder surveyed Gu Tianshu, his brows furrowed. His gaze fell upon Gu Tianshu locked in combat with four ancient kings.

“You are indeed a remarkable individual. Even I would hesitate to subdue you alone. But alas, how can one face the might of the Ancient Clans’ Candidate Kings?” The golden-robed elder smiled, leaping into the air. He opened his mouth and spat out a golden lotus of fire, sending it hurtling toward Gu Tianshu.

“Haha! It seems we’re not too late!” A loud laugh echoed. Two more powerful figures emerged from the Thunder Domain, plunging the Human Realm into despair.

“The Candidate King of the Feather Clan! And the Candidate King of the Blood Clan!” The Ancient Clans erupted into frenzy, their cheers resounding like a tidal wave. They seemed to already envision the figure they feared being crushed by multiple Candidate Kings.

“Sun Kemin, your mouth is really too venomous! Did you get blessed from years of tomb-robbing?” Diao Dedu and others glared at Sun Kemin, their expressions dark with reproach.

“This… it’s not my fault…” Sun Kemin looked at the surrounding gazes, which felt like they were looking at a comet, nearly crying.

As soon as two Candidate Kings appeared, they both launched attacks toward Gu Tianshu. Tremendous waves of power radiated from their bodies.

“This is impossible to fight! How can one face seven Candidate Kings?” The Human Realm’s people despaired, watching Gu Tianshu surrounded by eight Candidate Kings. The myth of invincibility might be broken today.

“Have you all arrived?” Gu Tianshu’s eyes flickered with a smile, his face devoid of fear. His hands moved swiftly, and a golden divine sword materialized from his grasp—its form identical to the Divine Emperor’s Sword of the Divine Clan.

The golden divine sword expanded dramatically, landing in Gu Tianshu’s hands. He seemed like a god descending from the heavens, wielding the golden sword.

“Buzz…” The massive golden sword split the starscape in two, radiating an overwhelming aura as it slashed toward seven Candidate Kings.

“Who is this man?” The three Candidate Kings who had initially fought Gu Tianshu spoke in disbelief, watching the golden sword’s radiant beam.

The starscape shattered. Seven Candidate Kings flashed with intense fear, their hands glowing as they countered Gu Tianshu’s world-shattering sword beam.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” The thunderous roars echoed endlessly. Seven Candidate Kings combined their attacks, converging them into a single strike that surged toward the golden sword beam.

It felt like the end of the world. Everyone trembled, gazing at Gu Tianshu standing there.

“Puk!” Golden divine blood cascaded like a crimson waterfall over Gu Tianshu’s towering body, spreading a sorrowful emotion among the Human Realm.

“Give up. We are seven against one Candidate Epoch Lord. You cannot withstand us!” The Crimson Phoenix Clan’s Candidate King spoke, his voice laced with sorrow.

“Is that so?” Gu Tianshu’s form plummeted, returning to its original size. Then he vanished from sight.

“What’s going on? Is it because he couldn’t maintain his divine body?” Everyone trembled, assuming Gu Tianshu had been severely wounded.

“Puk!” However, a beautiful blood blossom appeared in their view. Everyone’s faces were filled with shock.

Gray divine blood rained down, and people stared in disbelief at the horrifying gray blood—originating from the Mortal Clan’s Candidate King.

The divine blood mist spread, and an invisible wave passed through it. It showed no signs of regenerating.

“This is the first one!” A low voice echoed through the starry void. Gu Tianshu, pale as a sheet of paper, stepped out from the void, his gaze coldly scanning the remaining six Candidate Kings.

“How could this be!” Everyone was stunned. Even the Candidate Kings were shocked, unable to believe Gu Tianshu had slain one of them before their very eyes.

“I told you—killing me requires at least three of your deaths!” Gu Tianshu panted, his gaze scanning the Candidate Kings.

The feeling of coldness spread among them. Facing such a formidable Gu Tianshu, who wouldn’t be terrified?

“Magnificent!” People watched the Candidate King standing before them. Their blood seemed to ignite.

“Do you have more Candidate Kings?” Gu Tianshu smiled, standing like a mountain. His aura pressed heavily on the six Candidate Kings.

“Boom… Boom…” Thunderous roars echoed, drawing people’s attention to another battlefield. Gu Tianshu's expression changed.

There, Lu Tian and Zhong Zixuan fought against the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King. Each clash left the Candidate King with a grotesque wound, but their own cost was equally dire.

“You are strong. But who among the Human Realm can withstand our clans’ might?” The Candidate Kings spoke coldly, their gazes sweeping over the Ancient Clans' Epoch Peak masters. If these dozen men attacked the Human Realm, even Gu Tianshu would be unable to defend.

“Boom!” Lu Tian and Zhong Zixuan were thrown back, their eyes wide with shock. They finally understood the might of a Candidate King. Though they had been wounded by divine energy, their strength was still astonishing. Each strike pressed them down.

“Listen up, Ancient Clans! Bring forth your royal weapons and exterminate the Human Realm!” The Candidate Kings commanded, their voices icy.

“Yes!” Upon hearing this, the clans’ people wore ecstatic expressions. A terrifying killing intent凝聚ed in their bodies. Several royal weapons hummed above them, and the dozen Epoch Peak masters radiated overwhelming power, their eyes coldly scanning the Human Realm.

They couldn’t fight Gu Tianshu, but against the opposing Human Realm, they were confident. If they attacked, they would completely crush them.

“Have you all arrived?” As the Human Realm’s people were tense, a low voice echoed through the starry void.

Chapter 1476: The Human Realm’s Masters

“Who is it?” Upon hearing the voice, the clans’ people were stunned. They felt the power of the speaker within this sound.

“Did the Human Realm have masters?” Everyone was puzzled, gazing at the stars, their eyes narrowing slightly.

Black and white qi flickered. Two figures stepped out from the void, appearing before them.

A tall figure with long hair flowing over his shoulders. One eye resembled a blazing sun, the other a moon of darkness. His entire body radiated wild power.

“Uncle Dongbo!” Diao Dedu and others shouted, calling out to the old man. They knew how terrifying this elder was.

Especially Sun Kemin, who looked at him with reverence. In his heart, Dongbo Xin was no less than Gu Tianshu. He remembered how Dongbo Xin had single-handedly boarded a void warship and fought against dozens of clan Epoch Peak masters.

Beside Dongbo Xin stood a young man, radiating the same power. However, he was not a Candidate Epoch Lord but an Epoch Peak master.

“Dongbo Xin!” Soon, Dongbo Xin’s identity spread among the Human Realm. Their faces bore shock—how could the Human Realm have such a powerful figure?

Dual cultivation of divine and demonic. Since ancient times, only one person had succeeded—this was the third Epoch Lord of the Human Realm, the Divine and Demon Master. Dongbo Xin’s success in dual cultivation proved he was also a prodigy.

“Who is this young man? He radiates the same aura as Dongbo Xin. Is he a disciple of Dongbo Xin? But this is too absurd!” People were puzzled but felt invigorated. With another Epoch Peak master, the Human Realm’s strength had increased significantly.

“I remember!” Sun Shengtian and the Demon Lord looked stunned, recalling a painting from their clans.

The legendary master, Divine and Demon Master, had three sons. The eldest and second son did not appear in this era. One single-mindedly cultivated divine power, becoming the later Epoch Lord of the Divine Clan. The other single-mindedly cultivated demonic energy, eventually becoming the Epoch Lord of the Demon Clan. The third son of the Divine and Demon Master had never appeared.

The Divine and Demon Clans were closely related to the Divine and Demon Master. They could be considered descendants of him, but over time, their bloodline had thinned. However, the legends of the Divine and Demon Master and his two sons who became Epoch Lords were still preserved. Naturally, this included the third son of the Divine and Demon Master—Xuanyuan Qiong.

“Another Epoch Lord’s son has appeared!” The Human Realm trembled, their faces glowing with fervor as they gazed at the young man standing beside Dongbo Xin.

“You came too early,” Gu Tianshu smiled, gazing at Dongbo Xin with a sigh.

“Good. There won’t be any more Candidate Kings,” Dongbo Xin looked at the six remaining Candidate Kings, his eyes filled with fierce battle intent. He stepped beside Gu Tianshu.

“Do you intend to destroy our Human Realm?” Dongbo Xin remained as强势 as ever, his gaze sweeping over the six Candidate Kings.

“Does it matter?” The Candidate Kings responded fiercely. Even Dongbo Xin’s presence didn’t faze them.

“I’ve killed many Epoch Peak masters of the Royal Clans. I haven’t yet slain a Candidate King,” Dongbo Xin’s aura gradually rose, two currents of black and white qi swirling around him.

“Have you slain our Epoch Peak masters?” The Candidate Kings’ faces turned cold, their gazes turning sinister. They recalled the Epoch Peak masters sent out by the Ancient Clans to find the nine domain entrances—over a dozen in total, but only one bloodstained warship returned.

“Is it you?” The Candidate Kings’ killing intent surged, their gazes filled with hatred toward Dongbo Xin.

“Yes,” Dongbo Xin waved his hand. A series of grotesque heads appeared before everyone, devoid of life but still radiating immense power.

“Those are my clan’s Epoch Peak masters. They vanished years ago!”

“Those are my clan’s ancestral elders, Wang Dingtian! He also disappeared years ago!” The Ancient Clans’ people were stunned, recognizing the heads. They were shocked by Dongbo Xin’s power—over a dozen Epoch Peak masters, slain without a sound. Previously, Gu Tianshu had brought back the head of Mingzhenyan, causing the clans to tremble. Then he had slain five Epoch Peak masters and one Candidate King, making them shudder.

Now, Dongbo Xin’s display of over a dozen Epoch Peak masters’ heads was no less shocking than Gu Tianshu’s.

“Those were over a dozen Epoch Peak masters. How could they be slain so easily, leaving no sound?” The clans trembled. They realized they had underestimated the Human Realm’s strength—just Gu Tianshu and Dongbo Xin were already beyond comprehension.

The Candidate Kings’ faces darkened. These people had been the ones who ordered the search for the nine domain entrances. Now, they were slain by Dongbo Xin—how could they not be furious? Seeing the subdued Ancient Clans, their hearts tightened.

“Kill!” The Candidate Kings’ killing intent凝聚ed into a terrifying aura. They charged toward Dongbo Xin and Gu Tianshu, having suffered a significant blow from the over a dozen Epoch Peak masters.

Dongbo Xin’s eyes flashed with coldness. His aura erupted, black and white qi swirling around him. He struck the three Candidate Kings with one hand of Taiyin and one of Taixiang.

Gu Tianshu took a deep breath, his aura rising again. His hands moved swiftly, and a golden cauldron appeared, nine true dragons coiling around it. He pressed down on the other three Candidate Kings.

“Boom… Boom…” The thunderous roars echoed endlessly. Dongbo Xin didn’t even use any martial arts, fighting the three Candidate Kings like a human demon. Each punch he threw was overwhelming, leaving the three Candidate Kings in awe.

“The Human Realm’s Candidate Epoch Lord is so strong!” The Crimson Phoenix Clan’s Candidate King was震飞 by Dongbo Xin’s moon-like fist, his eyes filled with disbelief.

Even after countless battles, Gu Tianshu’s aura didn’t wane. His Vajra Attack术 continuously manifested various Epoch Treasures, pressing down on the three Candidate Kings. They spat blood repeatedly.

Xuanyuan Qiong watched the undefeated Dongbo Xin and Gu Tianshu fight against six Candidate Kings, their power suppressing them. A smile flickered across his face.

“I’ll help you!” Xuanyuan Qiong turned his gaze to Lu Tian and Zhong Zixuan, who were being pressed. He spoke softly, his hands moving, causing a thunderous roar.

“Annihilation Cut!” Xuanyuan Qiong spoke softly. A terrifying wave radiated from his hands, and black and white qi gathered at the top of his head. It formed an unparalleled blade, slicing toward the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King who was clashing with Lu Tian and Zhong Zixuan.

“Boom!” The Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King was thrown back, his body riddled with cracks. He had just endured Lu Tian and Zhong Zixuan’s attacks, then felt the black and white qi blade instantly annihilate the starscape before him.

“Get out!” The Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King was furious, having been pushed to such a state by Lu Tian and Zhong Zixuan. But his fury was nothing compared to Xuanyuan Qiong’s lineage—third son of the Human Realm’s third Epoch Lord. His two older brothers were also Epoch Lords. With such a terrifying identity, even if Xuanyuan Qiong was just an ordinary person, three powerful backings would have made him a supreme power.

The Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King punched, shattering the starscape. He clashed with the unparalleled blade before him.

“Boom…” The thunderous roar echoed through the sky. Black and white qi surged around the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King, who spat blood again, his eyes filled with disbelief as cracks spread across his arm.

“Not done yet!” Xuanyuan Qiong’s eyes smiled, leaping into the air. He flew toward the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King with his hands clenching fiercely.

“Roar…” A deafening roar echoed. The black and white qi that had spread around the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King instantly transformed into two dragons, entwining and merging. They wrapped around the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King's massive body.

As they entwined, Xuanyuan Qiong appeared instantly above the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King. Half his body radiated demonic energy, and half was filled with divine light. He slammed down on the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King's head.

“Good opportunity!” Lu Tian and Zhong Zixuan, their faces pale, watched the trapped Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King. They wouldn’t miss this chance. Their bodies flashed, appearing above the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King and unleashing powerful attacks.

“Voracious God Seven Steps Shatter Eternity!” Lu Tian roared, his golden foot descending with overwhelming power.

“Sky Void Nine Blades, One Blade Shatters the Sky!” Zhong Zixuan’s golden blade radiated immense power. It drained all his strength, making his body sway slightly.

“Open!” The Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King roared, howling to the sky. His black and white dragons instantly disintegrated before him.

Though it was only a moment, Lu Tian and the others were all prodigies. In that instant, their powerful attacks struck the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King's head.

The Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King felt a moment of panic. He was injured, and facing three attacks at once, he couldn’t afford to be careless. But the speed of their attacks was too fast—no matter how he tried to intercept, it was impossible. He could only instinctively raise his massive hand, adopting a sky-rending posture to block their attacks.

Chapter 1477: Ji Jiu You Arrives

Three figures with overwhelming auras transformed into three streaks of light, pressing toward the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King. People's faces turned tense.

“If successful, these three will surely be immortalized in history!” The Human Realm’s people looked with anticipation, waiting for the three to create a miracle.

With an Epoch Peak cultivation level, subduing a Candidate King—even the Epoch Lords in their youth hadn’t achieved this.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” Three thunderous sounds, almost simultaneous, struck the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King's raised hand.

Each sound caused his massive body to bend slightly. After three sounds, the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King's hand shattered in front of the Human Realm's expectant gaze, turning into a mist of blood that drifted through people’s sight.

“Not done yet!” Xuanbing Laozu looked shocked, speaking in disbelief. The strength of Lu Tian and the others had left even Xuanbing Laozu, an Epoch Peak master, feeling awestruck.

Three figures, drenched in the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King's blood, stepped heavily onto his head.

“Crack…” A powerful crack echoed through the starry void. The Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King's head shattered in people's astonished gazes, and his massive body continued to spread out, blood mist filling the starry void.

“Success!” The entire starry void fell silent. The Human Realm’s people wore expressions of exhilaration, watching Lu Tian and the others drenched in the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King's blood standing in the starry void.

The four words “Supreme Talent” seemed to shimmer above their heads. With the blood of a Candidate King, they had achieved unparalleled fame.

“Buzz…” The blood quickly gathered. The Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King stood in the starry void, his cultivation level dropping accordingly. He gazed at Lu Tian and the others with intense shock, not daring to linger as he flew toward the Ancient Clans.

Lu Tian and the others exchanged glances but didn’t chase after the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King. Their current state was also not good—after all, it was the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King. To subdue him to the point of no regeneration had drained them completely.

“Huff…” They took long breaths, their bodies swaying as they flew toward the Human Realm. Their arrival was met with countless fiery glances and a sudden eruption of deafening cheers.

Meanwhile, Dongbo Xin single-handedly faced three Candidate Kings. His entire body seemed like a madman, his eyes deep and profound. Black and white qi swirled around him.

“Mad God Fist!” A low voice echoed from Dongbo Xin. A wild aura radiated from him as he continuously swung his fists toward the three Candidate Kings.

At the same time, Gu Tianshu’s power was formidable. He had the three Candidate Kings at a disadvantage.

“Magnificent!” The Human Realm’s people cheered loudly. At this moment, they finally relaxed after the despair brought by eight Candidate Kings.

The Ancient Clans fell silent. Compared to their previous dominance, a sense of oppression spread among them.

“You still watching? Go and exterminate the Human Realm! Even if we die, we’ll annihilate their race!” The Candidate Kings who had been clashing with Dongbo Xin and the others shouted at the dozen Epoch Peak masters standing before them. The masters’ bodies trembled, their gazes turning toward the Human Realm.

At this moment, the Human Realm’s strength was negligible. Lu Tian and the others were severely wounded. The Epoch Peak masters were almost none, with only Xuanbing Laozu remaining. But he was not regarded by the Royal Clans’ Epoch Peak masters. After all, Xuanbing Laozu had only recently entered the peak.

Each of them had confidence in defeating Xuanbing Laozu.

“Kill!” Dozens of figures with overwhelming auras leaped into the air, like supreme killers. Their bodies radiated terrifying killing intent as they charged toward the Human Realm.

“What do we do?” Upon seeing the dozens of Epoch Peak masters moving, the Human Realm’s people panicked. Though Gu Tianshu and Dongbo Xin were powerful, they were completely tied down.

Lu Tian and the others were also severely wounded. As the Ancient Clans had thought, only Xuanbing Laozu could oppose them.

But there were over a dozen Epoch Peak masters. One Xuanbing Laozu could not possibly fight them all.

“I can still fight!” Xuanyuan Qiong slowly stood up, stepping to the front of the crowd. He gazed at the dozens of Epoch Peak masters with fierce battle intent.

“Do you think you are someone who can subdue us alone? You’re still far from it!” The dozens of Epoch Peak masters looked at Xuanyuan Qiong with contempt. Though the gray dragon above his head made them feel a deep sense of fear, they were over a dozen. Together, they had no fear even against a Candidate King.

Xuanyuan Qiong ignored the contempt of the dozens of Epoch Peak masters. He bit his finger, then pointed it, letting a drop of blood merge into the gray dragon. Then he carved in the air.

In an instant, the gray dragon transformed into a series of ancient characters, descending toward the dozens of Epoch Peak masters.

“Those ancient characters are the Divine and Demon Canon?” The people of the Divine and Demon Clans looked with eagerness.

Hearing their words, the Human Realm’s people were stunned. They gazed at the ancient characters radiating overwhelming power with disbelief.

The Divine and Demon Canon, created by the Divine and Demon Master. If one could comprehend it, they would learn how to cultivate both divine and demonic energies. Now, Xuanyuan Qiong had used it in this way.

“Just these ancient characters are priceless!” Sun Shengtian stared intently at the gray ancient characters, speaking softly.

“Boom… Boom…” As people were stunned, a series of ancient characters descended upon the dozens of Epoch Peak masters.

“No use!” The dozens of Epoch Peak masters looked indifferent, each launching their attacks. A series of thunderous explosions echoed above them.

“Puk…” Each ancient character’s destruction caused Xuanyuan Qiong to spit blood, his body trembling. Clearly, the ancient characters contained his blood, and some kind of pull had wounded him.

“Cough… Cough…” Several disheveled figures appeared before the people. The dozens of Epoch Peak masters’ mouths also bled, their eyes filled with admiration.

“Unfortunately, you are still one person. To have wounded us is already astonishing!” The dozens of Epoch Peak masters spoke, their gazes filled with admiration toward Xuanyuan Qiong. But then they immediately charged toward the Human Realm again.

“This is truly over!” The Human Realm’s people looked desperate, their auras rising. They would not sit idly by even if the opponents were Epoch Peak masters, who could subdue them with a single breath.

“Buzz…” Several Epoch Treasures were activated by Sun Kemin and others. Their eyes also held coldness, knowing this was the moment to fight for their lives.

“We have royal weapons too. This time you don’t have an advantage!” The dozens of Epoch Peak masters looked down, their eyes filled with contempt. The royal weapons above the Ancient Clans radiated brilliant divine light, clashing against the Epoch Treasures.

“Do you have any more tricks? If not, we can annihilate your race!” The dozens of Epoch Peak masters spoke loudly. A suffocating aura was gathered in their hands.

“Of course we do!” As the Human Realm’s people felt despair, a deep voice echoed through the starry void. A hunched old man walked from the starry void, carrying a broken staff on his shoulder. His clothes were tattered, and from his appearance, he looked like a fortune-teller—unprofitable at that.

“Ji Jiu You!” Upon the old man’s appearance, people from the Seven Star Island trembled. They recognized his identity.

“He is!” Among the dozens of Epoch Peak masters, one from the Mortal Clan looked shocked. This person was the very one who had once tried to intercept the Seven Star Island’s void warship and was stopped by Ji Jiu You.

Remembering Ji Jiu You's terrifying power, the Mortal Clan’s master trembled. Back then, he had been like a child before Ji Jiu You, with no ability to resist.

“Ah! The Human Realm still has a Candidate Epoch Lord!” Next, the Human Realm’s people looked excited.

“It's time to end this. Now we have the right to talk with you,” Ji Jiu You smiled, instantly appearing before the dozens of Epoch Peak masters. He threw his broken staff toward them.

Chapter 1478: Negotiations

The gray broken staff looked ragged, but after Ji Jiu You threw it, it instantly expanded. It became a river of stars, swirling through the starry void and immediately surrounding the dozens of Epoch Peak masters. The ancient characters on the staff radiated powerful energy, covering the entire starry void.

“Rippling… Rippling…” The river of stars reversed, quickly contracting and wrapping around the dozens of Epoch Peak masters.

“Ah…” The dozens of Epoch Peak masters naturally knew this broken staff was no ordinary item. Their bodies were filled with light, and they launched their martial arts toward the staff.

“Boom… Boom…” The thunderous roars echoed. Their attacks struck the river of stars, producing dazzling light.

But soon after, the dozens of Epoch Peak masters looked shocked. A terrifying wave surged toward them. The ancient characters on the staff rapidly rotated, countering their attacks.

A series of terrifying waves swept over the dozens of Epoch Peak masters. They looked pale, trapped within their own martial arts.

“Buzz…” Ji Jiu You performed hand signs. His hands moved, and the staff instantly contracted, binding the Epoch Peak masters who had just resisted his attack like a bundle of bamboo.

The ancient characters flowed, and the dozens of Epoch Peak masters turned pale. They shouted desperately, trying to break free from the staff. But soon their faces showed shock—they found that even with all their strength, they could not break free from the staff’s binding. It felt like they were sealed.

“Powerful!” The Human Realm people became invigorated, their faces turning fierce as they gazed at the Ancient Clans.

Now that the dozens of Epoch Peak masters were bound by Ji Jiu You, the Ancient Clans had no master at the peak. But on the Human Realm’s side were Xuanbing Laozu, Zhong Zixuan, Lu Tian, and Xuanyuan Qiong.

“Kill!” The Human Realm people all roared to the sky, their voices echoing through the starry void. Their eyes were filled with fierce killing intent toward the Ancient Clans.

After so many days of battle, from the beginning of the talent competition, the Ancient Clans had always looked down on the Human Realm. They had acted like they were superior.

In the talent competition, Lu Xiting single-handedly annihilated many of the Ancient Clans’ talents. It was a long-awaited victory for the Human Realm, but they hadn’t dared to be too bold. After all, the Ancient Clans had over a dozen Epoch Peak masters.

Then came Lu Tian’s generation of talents. Lu Tian and Zhu Ge Qingtian had also defeated the Ancient Clans’ talents, slaying a son of an ancient king. But this had provoked the anger of Epoch Peak masters who wanted to crush Lu Tian.

Gu Tianshu returned powerfully, subduing many Epoch Peak masters and slaying five of them. This had given the Human Realm hope—one person could withstand the Ancient Clans.

But then, Candidate Kings appeared again. People’s hopes were shattered once more. They would never forget Gu Tianshu's undefeated body, his straight spine, and bloodstained robes. He had faced eight Candidate Kings with a promise to eliminate three or four of them, making the Candidate Kings fear him.

Lu Tian, Zhong Zixuan, and Xuanyuan Qiong were even more astonishing. With their Epoch Peak strength, they had shattered the Voracious Tribe’s Candidate King who was known for his flesh. They had achieved their legendary status.

But they hadn’t dared to be too bold, for there were still Candidate King battles. However, with Dongbo Xin’s arrival and his cooperation with Gu Tianshu to suppress many Candidate Kings, they had fought.

But there were still over a dozen Epoch Peak masters attacking them. Ji Jiu You’s appearance and his powerful move had made the people go mad, roaring to the sky. Their suppressed emotions were released with each scream.

“Defeat the Ancient Clans!”
