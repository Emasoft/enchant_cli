“Boom……” After absorbing the Reincarnation Blood, the attachment seemed to have taken a stimulant, its body radiated with divine brilliance, as if an Epoch-level powerhouse had been reborn. In the gray torrent, it kept pounding, allowing the martial arts of Mingyuan’s three to strike its flesh.

The powerful techniques carried overwhelming fluctuations, repeatedly striking the human skin, but they could only slow down the attachment’s control over the flesh.

“Young Master, it won’t work! We can only block, but to kill it is extremely difficult. You must use the life-saving secret technique left by our ancestors!” A saint at peak level elder looked at the human skin advancing through the gray divine power, his face showing a solemn expression.

“Damn it! So precious an item wasted on an attachment!” Mingyuan’s face darkened as he slapped his hand, summoning a pseudo-Epoch Treasure to suppress the human skin and halt its advance.

“Not enough!” Mingyuan’s face darkened, his voice laced with regret as he waved his hand again, releasing a blood-red head from his grasp.

“Hum……” A humming sound echoed as the blood-red head, under Mingyuan’s control, emitted countless seals. Dozens of wronged souls burst forth from it, each immensely powerful.

If Luo Tian were here, he would be stunned by the blood-red head’s pressure, which carried a formidable Epoch power. Though not as strong as an authentic Epoch Treasure, it was far superior to ordinary pseudo-Epoch Treasures.

Especially the overwhelming killing intent radiating from the head, even an early Epoch powerhouse would be moved to awe. This was the life-saving technique cultivated by the nine ancestors of the Ming Domain, forged when the former Ming Domain Master cultivated an Epoch Treasure.

Two elders at peak saint level showed reverence, gazing at the blood-red head. They knew that over the years, the nine great powers of the Ming Domain had strengthened themselves through countless battles. The souls of those slain by the Ming Domain were extracted and refined into this Ming Shen, amplifying its power to the point where it could slay any half-step Epoch powerhouse. Even early Epoch masters would fear it, and a single mistake could result in severe injury.

“Die!” Mingyuan’s face twisted with ferocity as he pushed his hand into the void. The blood-red head, brimming with overwhelming power, vanished from the sight of the two peak saint elders.

In an instant, the blood-red head, wielding sharp Epoch power, appeared before the attachment.

“Boom……” Even a pseudo-Epoch Treasure and the martial arts of two peak saint elders could not withstand an Epoch-level powerhouse’s flesh. Before the blood-red Ming Shen, it was as fragile as a bean curd and was pierced through.

“Roar……” A chorus of divine explosions erupted, countless souls howled, biting at the flesh of the Epoch-level powerhouse.

A red light flew from the human skin, emitting a venomous aura that stirred dread in Mingyuan’s four hearts. It rushed toward the clifftop, howling.

“Want to run? If you escape, my use of Ming Shen would be a huge loss!” Mingyuan’s face twisted with hatred as he watched the blood-red light, his voice cold.

Mingyuan slapped his hand again, and a gray gourd fell into his grasp. The lid was lifted, and a powerful suction enveloped the blood-red light.

However, the attachment had survived on this cliff for so long as a formidable entity. Though wounded by Ming Shen, it still broke free from the suction, losing half its energy and escaping the gourd’s grasp.

Meanwhile, countless souls expelled from Ming Shen were also drawn into the gray gourd by its suction.

“Returning, I must ask the ancestors to refine these souls back into Ming Shen. Without them, this Ming Shen is far stronger than ordinary pseudo-Epoch Treasures but poses no threat to early Epoch masters,” Mingyuan sighed, his gaze turning toward the clifftop with hatred. If it weren’t for Luo Tian, he wouldn’t have wasted such a secret technique.

“Young Master, don’t grieve. The Epoch Scripture on that boy and the medicinal sage here on Duan Shen Cliff are worth any loss!” The two peak saint elders consoled.

“If I had used Ming Shen the moment I saw him, there would be no such trouble!” Mingyuan’s face showed regret. He had been too arrogant, failing to strike Luo Tian down with Ming Shen.

……

Luo Tian ascended the Duan Shen Cliff, the immense pressure growing stronger. At this moment, Luo Tian felt like an ordinary person; his divine energy ocean was silent, relying solely on his physical body to move.

“Mountains weary the horse!” Luo Tian’s face showed bitterness as his purple eyes gazed at the seemingly close dilapidated structures. He trudged forward under the heavy pressure.

“Hum……” A red light flashed as it rushed toward Luo Tian, appearing before him in an instant.

Though his cultivation was suppressed, Luo Tian’s spiritual sense never rested, constantly spreading to perceive the surroundings.

At the moment the red light appeared, Luo Tian sensed it and turned his body sharply, gazing at the red light.

“Save……” A low mental voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, causing his face to change abruptly.

“They’ve already killed that powerful attachment!” Luo Tian was shocked by Mingyuan’s three hidden strength. He reached out to grasp the red light emitting a rescue signal.

“Save or not save? This thing is dangerous; it might retaliate in the future!” Luo Tian pondered, watching the red light deprived of half its power.

“Hum……” As Luo Tian mused, emerald flames erupted from his dantian, swirling around him with an eager aura.

“Do you want it?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed confusion as he asked the emerald crystalline fire.

“Save……” Not only did the emerald fire emit an eager aura, but the blood-red attachment also conveyed a longing to escape from Luo Tian’s grasp.

“This is convenient!” Luo Tian shook his head, releasing the red light and letting it merge with the elder.

“Hum……” The emerald flames surged skyward, instantly enveloping the blood-red attachment and plunging into Luo Tian’s body.

“It should be a good thing,” Luo Tian sighed softly, ignoring the silent emerald flames in his dantian. His eyes turned solemn again as he marched toward the clifftop.

Oppressive atmosphere suppressed Luo Tian’s cultivation, but his steps were steady. Relying on his formidable physical body, he moved slowly yet faster than Mingyuan’s three pursuing him.

“Damn it! On Duan Shen Cliff, the Reincarnation Body has such a huge advantage!” Mingyuan’s three felt their distance to Luo Tian growing, their faces flushed with anger.

Time passed slowly as Luo Tian finally reached the outskirts of the dilapidated structures. A broken gate, resembling a heavenly portal, stood before him.

“Amazement!” Luo Tian’s face showed shock as he gazed at the structures, emitting ancient and solemn vibes.

Previously, from below the cliff, the structures seemed no different from ordinary buildings, though dilapidated and seemingly normal.

But now, with the gate a thousand zhang away, Luo Tian finally saw its true form through the gray mist.

“Vast,” was his first impression—completely unlike a place for human habitation. The architectural style differed greatly from humans, its scale immense, surpassing human dwellings by two or three times.

“Which clan once lived here?” Luo Tian wondered, stepping into the massive gate.

Decay filled his senses as he observed the surrounding structures. Despite years of neglect, they remained intact on Duan Shen Cliff’s peak, astonishing Luo Tian with the cliff’s mystique.

“Hum……” Next moment, Luo Tian’s face abruptly changed as the surroundings underwent a complete transformation, as if entering another world.

“Roar……” Low growls echoed as Luo Tian walked through the structures, but they now appeared restored, radiating divine brilliance and impenetrable strength. He felt even a full-force strike could not break them.

“Boom……” Then, towering figures resembling iron towers appeared in Luo Tian’s vision—human-faced but three times human size, clad in beast skins and wielding various stone weapons. Some held bone-made wolf-ram staves; each step produced a thunderous sound.

“Humans, despicable race! Daring to invade our蛮族 (Barbarian Clan), today we descend upon the nine domains and teach you a lesson!” A giant shouldering a wolf-tooth staff roared, his aura fierce. Behind him stood numerous giants of the same stature, shouting with thunderous voices toward the sky.

“Epoch Peak!” Luo Tian’s spirit trembled, gazing at the towering Barbarian Clan leader. His mind shook in awe.

At this moment, Luo Tian finally understood he had entered a vision, one还原ing the truth of an ancient era.

“Barbarian Clan! We humans never intended to invade you, but you sought to occupy our nine domains. Why then are you here on Duan Shen Cliff?” Figures flickered as more people appeared, the first a middle-aged powerhouse with equally fierce aura, matching the Barbarian Clan leader.

“Reincarnation Body!” Luo Tian’s face trembled, as if immersed in the scene. He gazed at the human powerhouse leading the charge, his expression filled with awe and reverence.

“Epoch Peak Reincarnation Body! I wish to test how strong you truly are. Surprisingly, the weakest among the nine clans, humans, have produced such a remarkable existence!” The Barbarian Clan leader’s face showed a hint of battlelust, his voice laced with admiration.

“Damn it! No one can invade our Barbarian Clan!” The Barbarian leader’s followers shouted, striking their stone weapons together. Their fierce aura radiated from the towering figures, their might overwhelming.

“Kill!” With a single command, both sides clashed. The Barbarian forces moved like monstrous beasts, wielding their stone weapons to charge at the human side.

“We humans have always been weak. If it weren’t for several Epoch Masters suppressing the domains, we might have already been wiped out by your races. How could we occupy you?” The Epoch Peak Reincarnation Body spoke, his voice authoritative.

“Enough talk! Let’s fight. Perhaps it has been too long since we’ve emerged, and the world has forgotten us!” The Barbarian leader’s aura surged as he brandished his wolf-tooth staff, charging toward the Reincarnation Body.

“Overstepping!” The Epoch Peak Reincarnation Body, an astonishing existence capable of escaping even under an Epoch Master’s attack, finally erupted in fury at the Barbarian’s aggression.

Golden swords swept through clouds and winds, rushing toward the Barbarian leader. The battle erupted instantly.

One side of Barbarians radiated overwhelming might; the other, humans with no change in the world. The clash was fierce, darkening the sun and moon, shaking Duan Shen Cliff endlessly.

The Epoch Peak Reincarnation Body’s might was boundless, while the Barbarian leader was equally formidable, daring to clash with the Reincarnation Body’s body.

Luo Tian gazed at the fierce battle, his face filled with admiration. Both sides were composed of warriors at least at the saint level; their fluctuations were so immense they nearly overturned the stars within millions of li around Duan Shen Cliff.

“This is the era before the world changed, where humans were so powerful and otherworldly beings existed!” Luo Tian had encountered the Undying Clan in Yuelong Valley, and now he saw the Barbarians. His heart stirred with battlelust, longing to travel back to that era of热血 (fiery passion).

“Plop……” The Epoch Peak Reincarnation Body ultimately prevailed, his sword slicing through the Barbarian leader’s head, extinguishing its life.

But in return, the Reincarnation Body also suffered a heavy price, nearly shattered by the Barbarian leader’s bone-made wolf-tooth staff. Blood spewed forth, staining Duan Shen Cliff with irreversible injuries.

Both sides were battered; most fell in the Barbarian structures, darkening the sun and moon. The Epoch Peak Reincarnation Body collapsed onto a altar, unable to rise again.

“Let me, Zhongli Tian, who was undefeated all my life, die here!” The Reincarnation Body smiled faintly as he stood on the altar, speaking softly.

“Kill……” The Barbarians, fierce and valiant, seeing their leader’s head severed and life extinguished, turned bloodshot eyes toward the wounded Zhongli Tian.

“Ah……” As the Barbarians’ weapons and martial arts neared Zhongli Tian, a woman’s agonized cry echoed through Duan Shen Cliff. Her voice was piercingly tragic, resounding across the nine heavens and ten earths.

A supreme aura spread everywhere. As the voice fell, the massive Barbarian figures all collapsed in a burst of blood on Duan Shen Cliff.

“Human race! A disciple has become an Epoch Master!” The bloodied people were overjoyed, gazing at the void. A white-clad figure appeared in their sight.

Dressed in pure elegance, a gray Soul-Eating Beast roared forward. On its massive body stood a woman, her eyes filled with sorrow. She vanished from the Soul-Eating Beast’s form and appeared beside the bloodied Zhongli Tian.

“Miaoyin, you’ve come!”

“You finally took that step. I can’t accompany you anymore!” Zhongli Tian smiled gently as he saw the white-clad woman, speaking softly while coughing blood.

“You won’t die! I am an Epoch Master; you won’t die!” The female Epoch Master’s tears glistened as she took Zhongli Tian’s sword, slicing her wrist. Blood splattered into his mouth.

Luo Tian stood there, gazing at Zhongli Tian and the female Epoch Master. He could clearly sense their relationship was that of lovers.

“Why? You could have attained the Epoch Master’s path, but you gave it to me!” The woman’s eyes glistened with tears as she looked at Zhongli Tian, retrieving an Immortal Divine Medicine to try and prolong his life.

……

Chapter 1142: Re-Evolution

On Duan Shen Cliff, Luo Tian walked through the vision, witnessing events from an unknown epoch. His gaze fell upon a man and woman standing on a towering altar, their eyes filled with deep affection.

The female Epoch Master showed no regret as she retrieved the Immortal Divine Medicine, refining it to prolong Zhongli Tian’s life.

“Don’t waste it; it won’t work. My vitality is gone, and I can only speak now because of my Reincarnation Body’s strength. But it won’t last long!” Zhongli Tian smiled faintly.

“I’ll slaughter the Barbarians to avenge you!” Miaoyin, the female Epoch Master, eyes filled with killing intent. The world itself changed as she gazed at the altar beneath them. She knew this was the entrance for the Barbarians to enter the nine domains.

“Don’t, the Barbarians are simple; simplicity is good but their weakness lies in being easily manipulated. I feel they’ve been used!” Zhongli Tian shook his head gently, his brows furrowed.

“You won’t die! You won’t die!” Miaoyin continued, her Epoch Master’s blood flowing from her hands into Zhongli Tian’s mouth.

“Don’t waste your strength; seeing you become an Epoch Master is enough for me. Otherwise, I’d worry about how you’d survive alone in this world. You should be safe through this epoch!” Zhongli Tian smiled gently, his eyes never leaving Miaoyin. His entire world seemed to consist of her alone.

“No……” As Zhongli Tian’s vitality faded faster, Miaoyin let out a heart-wrenching scream.

Luo Tian stood there, feeling the despair in Miaoyin’s voice. He thought if it were him, he would have gone even more mad.

Miaoyin cast seals into Zhongli Tian’s body, each carrying immense power.

“You won’t be alone; even if I am an Epoch Master, what use is that!” Miaoyin spoke softly, sealing Zhongli Tian’s body.

“I’ll guard Duan Shen Cliff from now on; the Barbarians will never set foot in our race! You all, leave!” Miaoyin addressed those still alive, sitting cross-legged before Zhongli Tian.

“Yes!” The people’s faces showed reverence as they gazed at the couple on the altar, exiting Duan Shen Cliff.

Before Miaoyin’s silence, she gazed deeply at the spot where Luo Tian stood, as if across time, meeting his eyes. This made Luo Tian’s spirit tremble.

“Sigh……” A long sigh echoed from Miaoyin, her voice laced with helplessness. She then sat cross-legged on the altar.

The gray Soul-Eating Beast also lay beside them, as if time had stopped, undisturbed.

“Hum……” At this point, Luo Tian emerged from the vision, returning to the dilapidated scene. He stood beside an altar, a powerful pressure instantly enveloping him, causing his face to change abruptly.

Though countless years had passed, the altar still radiated divine brilliance. A statue-like figure sat on it, like a monument, emitting thunderous sounds from its body.

“This is Master Zhongli Tian!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed intense shock. Even as a Reincarnation Body, he felt the immense pressure from the body.

A golden sword was planted before Zhongli Tian, his eyes closed, seated like the sun. He remained motionless, devoid of life but with an intact body.

“Respect Master!” Luo Tian bowed to Zhongli Tian’s corpse, his eyes filled with reverence. Zhongli Tian had died defending the nine domains from the Barbarians’ attack, sacrificing for humanity. Otherwise, the Barbarian cavalry would have invaded the nine domains, killing countless people.

But soon after, Luo Tian’s face turned contemplative. In the vision, the female Epoch Master named Miaoyin had sat beside Zhongli Tian on this altar. Yet now, the altar showed no sign of her presence.

“Where is that female Epoch Master? Did she leave later for another reason, or did something else happen?” Luo Tian pondered but knew it was beyond his comprehension. At Zhongli Tian and Miaoyin’s level, they had transcended all, nearly omnipotent.

“Luo Tian, where do you think you’re running?” As Luo Tian pondered, Mingyuan’s three approached him, their eyes filled with killing intent.

They gazed at Zhongli Tian’s corpse on the altar, their faces showing awe. They too felt the immense pressure from the body, deeper than Luo Tian’s perception. Though dead, it remained incorruptible, like a supreme overlord, preventing them from approaching even an inch.

“I sensed the aura of Immortal Divine Medicine; it’s stored within this Epoch Peak Reincarnation Body, keeping his body immortal. His vitality remains formidable!” Two peak saint-level elders trembled, gazing at Zhongli Tian.

“First kill this kid, then find a way to take the body. An Epoch Peak Reincarnation Body is invaluable; it can be refined into an ultimate Epoch Treasure!” Mingyuan’s voice was laced with excitement, his eyes on Luo Tian. His blood-red head was in his grasp.

“This is!” As Luo Tian saw Mingyuan’s blood-red head, his face changed abruptly. A strange panic rose in him, his eyes filled with intense fear. He could sense Mingyuan’s head could not be resisted even by his unparalleled body.

“Kid, do you see this? This is the treasure cultivated by our Ming Domain’s former Epoch Master. It carries a fragment of Epoch power. Even half-step Epoch masters would bleed to death, let alone you!” Mingyuan’s face was filled with mockery as he spoke to Luo Tian.

“Kill!” The two peak saint-level elders acted immediately, rushing toward Luo Tian as if returning to primal combat. Each wielded a sword, striking at Luo Tian.

This was unavoidable; within this place, they had all lost their cultivation and could only fight with physical strength. Though unsure if they could defeat the formidable Reincarnation Body, Luo Tian’s confidence was unshaken.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows as he sensed the two elders’ attacks, then smiled faintly. He showed no fear, realizing both elders had no divine energy either.

“This is convenient!” Luo Tian’s feet pushed off the ground, and he caught both elders’ swords with his hands.

“Crack……” Two golden swords were seized by Luo Tian, causing him to retreat a few steps. Yet his hands showed no injuries, only two white marks.

“His body is so strong! Catching our life-essence swords!” The two elders’ faces turned pale, gazing at Luo Tian’s hands. They tried to pull their swords free but found them unmoved.

“You’re just helpless lambs without divine energy!” Luo Tian smiled coldly, applying force to the swords. They bent under his grip and were pulled back.

At the same time, Luo Tian’s fists flew out, striking at the two elders. His punches carried fierce winds and appeared before their chests.

But as Luo Tian’s fists neared the elders, a sudden sense of danger invaded his mind. His face darkened.

Though lacking divine energy, his speed was strangely fast. Upon sensing the danger, he withdrew his hands and dodged backward.

“Sigh……” Luo Tian’s speed was fast, but he was slightly late. A bloodline appeared on his arm, and a cold aura rushed into his body.

“Kid, thinking your body is strong enough to be arrogant before me?” Mingyuan’s face showed a cold smile, standing before the two elders. His blood-red head glowed with a bloody light. Luo Tian’s blood had stained it, vanishing instantly.

Cold aura rushed through Luo Tian’s body, swiftly destroying his meridians. Blood trickled from his mouth, darkening his face. His eyes showed intense fear as he gazed at Mingyuan’s Ming Shen.

“How does it feel? Your meridians are constantly being destroyed!” Mingyuan smiled confidently. This weapon was so powerful it could kill even half-step Epoch masters, let alone Luo Tian.

“Wait; you won’t need to act now. Within an hour, you’ll be a broken man!” Mingyuan’s three faces showed confidence as they waited for Luo Tian to become useless.

“This was worth it! Not only did I obtain the Epoch Scripture, but there’s also a chance of obtaining an Immortal Divine Medicine and a body at the Epoch Peak!” Mingyuan mused, his eyes on Luo Tian.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s face showed tension as the cold aura destroyed his meridians. His hands had already lost sensation, and the numbness spread throughout his body.

……

Chapter 1143: Emergence

At the peak of Duan Shen Cliff, Luo Tian stood with a grim face. His hands had completely lost sensation and were gradually numbing.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s heart was cold; his divine energy could not be used at all. He could only watch the cold aura destroy his meridians.

“What to do?” Luo Tian’s heart was truly anxious; if all meridians were destroyed, he would have no resistance.

Mingyuan’s three watched Luo Tian with confidence, waiting for him to lose all ability before acting. They didn’t want to waste any strength.

“Hum……” As Mingyuan’s three were confident and Luo Tian thought of solutions, his body began to emit waves. The silent dantian radiated a hot aura, making the cold aura that had been destroying him show fear.

“Emerald Crystalline Fire!” Luo Tian’s face showed joy, sensing the hot aura in his dantian.

“Boom……” Next moment, emerald flames surged from Luo Tian’s dantian, radiating hatred in his mind. The emerald fire transformed into dozens of fire dragons, roaming through Luo Tian’s body.

“Kill……” A low voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, causing his face to change abruptly. He knew this voice came from the essence of Emerald Crystalline Fire in his dantian.

“It can even speak!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed joy; he knew Emerald Crystalline Fire was one step closer to becoming a complete fire spirit.

Moreover, he could feel Emerald Crystalline Fire’s power had become stronger than before. If he weren’t the master, he wouldn’t have endured its terrifying temperature.

“Sizzle……” In an instant, Emerald Crystalline Fire swept through Luo Tian’s body with terrifying heat. It seemed to hate the cold aura invading his body, instantly burning it all away.

Not only that, Emerald Crystalline Fire also contained powerful vitality, restoring Luo Tian’s damaged meridians instantly.

Mingyuan’s three waited for Luo Tian to lose all ability, but after a while, his eyes grew brighter. They felt an ominous premonition but chose to wait due to their confidence in Ming Shen.

“Sigh……” Until Luo Tian’s body emitted waves of white smoke, they realized something was wrong. Their faces showed confusion.

“Kill!” As Luo Tian recovered, he pushed off the ground and vanished from his spot, appearing before the two peak saint-level elders blocking Mingyuan. He struck again with both fists.

“How could he still have the strength to fight!” The three elders’ faces turned pale, their shock immeasurable.

“Crack……” In a moment of distraction, Luo Tian’s fists struck the chests of both elders.

The two elders’ faces still showed disbelief before their bodies were sent flying, as if struck by two mountains. Blood spewed from their mouths, chests caved in, and they flew a hundred zhang before colliding with the dilapidated structures.

“Next, it’s your turn!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed fierce killing intent as he moved. A thunderous sound echoed from his body without pause, and he rushed toward Mingyuan.

“I don’t believe you can withstand Ming Shen!” Mingyuan, seeing Luo Tian rushing toward him, felt fear but his confidence in Ming Shen increased. He held Ming Shen and rushed toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian struck with a fist, aiming for Mingyuan’s chest. His physical strength was terrifying, capable of resisting any saint weapon.

“Die!” Mingyuan’s heart was delighted as he swung Ming Shen, turning it into a red light to stab at Luo Tian’s fist. He was confident that if he struck, Luo Tian would be pierced through.

But Luo Tian had planned ahead; knowing Ming Shen couldn’t be resisted, he turned his foot and missed the strike. Like a whirlwind, he appeared behind Mingyuan and struck with another fist at his back.

“Crack……” The sound of cracking echoed again. Though Mingyuan was a descendant of the Ming Domain, his strength even rivaled that of the immortal body of the divine clan Sun Miechen. However, without divine energy, any divine body was crushed here. Especially the top-ranked Reincarnation Body.

Mingyuan’s back was caved in by Luo Tian’s fist, his body flying and blood spewing from his mouth. He fell to the ground.

“Clang……” Mingyuan’s body hit the ground, and Ming Shen fell beside him.

“Boom……” Before Mingyuan could react, Luo Tian’s figure descended like a god, crushing Mingyuan’s body with his foot.

“Smack……” Luo Tian swung his hand, striking Mingyuan’s face repeatedly with a wild look.

“The Ming Domain isn’t superior? Show your secret techniques!” Luo Tian shouted, repeatedly striking Mingyuan’s face as if to kill him.

“Junior stop!” The two peak saint-level elders, pale-faced, stood up. Watching Mingyuan about to be beaten to death, they ignored their injuries and rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Get out…” Luo Tian shouted, kicking Mingyuan into the ground and appearing before the two elders. He struck them with two fists.

The elders came fast but left faster, being sent flying back by Luo Tian’s punches and nearly shattered.

“Luo Tian, you’ll die… you’ll die!” Mingyuan, dazed and confused, picked up Ming Shen from the ground. His eyes were fierce as he stared at Luo Tian.

“My great Ming Domain Master, your descendant is in life-threatening danger. Please destroy the enemy!” Mingyuan’s eyes showed devotion as he slashed his wrist with Ming Shen.

Blood immediately flew from his wrist, landing on Ming Shen and quickly absorbed into it.

After this, Mingyuan’s face showed a wild smile as he let blood flow into Ming Shen. His eyes stared at Luo Tian: “You’ll die for challenging me!”

“Hum……” As Mingyuan’s words fell, his Ming Shen turned into a blood-red light and broke free from his hand. It hovered above him, emitting countless blood seals around it.

Blood aura surged; Mingyuan seemed to activate a formidable restriction, and a blood-red shadow appeared in Luo Tian’s vision.

At the moment the blood-red shadow appeared, Luo Tian’s heart sank. A heavy aura made his legs tremble, giving him an urge to kneel.

Mingyuan and the two peak saint-level elders showed reverence, kneeling on the ground as they gazed at the blood-red shadow.

Under their devotion, the blood-red shadow took the form of a middle-aged man, imposing and mighty. He seemed like an eternal emperor, conquering all with endless slaughter.

“Please ancestors, destroy this enemy!” Mingyuan shouted, pointing at Luo Tian with his eyes filled with fanaticism.

“Kid, this is my greatest secret technique—summoning a projection of our Ming Domain’s Epoch Master. It can destroy any existence!” Mingyuan knelt there, gazing at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s heart was in turmoil; his eyes showed intense fear as he gazed at the shadow. He wanted to release Dongbo Xin but knew even that would be futile. An Epoch Master could annihilate a late Epoch master with one glance, let alone a shadow projection. Even Dongbo Xin at the late Epoch level might not withstand it.

The blood-red shadow seemed to understand Mingyuan’s words, gazing at Luo Tian with chaotic eyes. It was unaffected by the body of Zhongli Tian on the altar and slowly raised its hands to crush Luo Tian.

Thunderous explosions filled the sky as the shadow raised its hand. The entire sky trembled, and thunder and lightning roared above Duan Shen Cliff. The blood-red hand seemed capable of crushing the cliff itself, slowly descending toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s face was at its worst; before this world-destroying power, he had no will to resist. This was an attack from an Epoch Master—capable of annihilating all existence.
