However, Luo Tian was no pushover. Each time he narrowly evaded the attacks, and even when wounded, it was only superficial injuries, causing Luoshui's forehead to be drenched in cold sweat.

Puh! Puh!

Two long spears simultaneously struck Luo Tian and Wu Mian, causing both to retreat. Both panted heavily. In an hour, they had clashed over a hundred times without inflicting any fatal wounds.

"Wu Xiang!" Wu Mian roared, his spear swirling into countless shadows. Each shadow was real and surged toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 2484: The Arrival of the Heavenly Ghost King

Ten... a hundred... a thousand...

Countless spear shadows, each radiating immense divine power, surged toward Luo Tian, making his face grim.

"Spears command the heavens!" Luo Tian barked, his hands weaving through the air, conjuring storm-like spear shadows that whirled up.

Collisions echoed as black spear shadows were obliterated by the dark storm. Fierce fluctuations erupted from the arena, leaving the watching disciples in awe.

After thirty seconds, Luo Tian's figure materialized. His gaze fell upon Wu Mian, the ghost standing nearby.

"Consume Heaven!" Wu Mian bellowed. A black domain suddenly expanded, spanning four thousand zhang, radiating terrifying power that crushed toward Luo Tian.

The black domain seemed to draw strength from the dark sky above, exuding a formidable aura.

"Domain? I have one too!" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed. A gray Reincarnation Domain suddenly unfurled, expanding to four thousand zhang. This clone was identical in form to Luo Tian's body in the Immortal Realm but differed in essence. They were two distinct entities yet deeply connected. Thus, Luo Tian's domain was also the Reincarnation Domain. At that moment, Luo Tian was a fusion of two beings—though the reincarnation pavilion's clone dominated, and most memories belonged to that clone. After merging, he had lost his Immortal Realm memories because his divine soul had been severely wounded and nearly shattered.

Roar... Scream...

The two domains collided instantly, producing a series of sharp cracks. With a single crack, Wu Mian's domain shattered.

"Master Wu Mian's domain was shattered by Luo Tian's!" The disciples of the Reincarnation Pavilion looked on in shock. Wu Mian was no ordinary strength, guarding the Gate of Calamity. The disciples knew Wu Mian was about to enter the Immortal King's mid-stage, making it rare for anyone in the early stage of Immortal King to match him.

"Since when did my domain become so powerful?" Luo Tian was startled. He had thought his domain could only neutralize Wu Mian's, but instead it had crushed it outright.

"Boom..." Wu Mian trembled slightly, his body suppressed by Luo Tian's domain. Feeling the overwhelming pressure, Wu Mian spoke in a hoarse voice: "How did your domain achieve this?"

"Souls-Subjugating Seal!" As people marveled, Luo Tian ignored Wu Mian's question and struck again. A black soul-subjugating seal hovered above Luo Tian's head, then embedded itself into his domain.

"Buzz..." The unique suppressing aura for ghosts erupted violently, colliding with the Reincarnation Domain to suppress Wu Mian. Crackling sounds echoed from Wu Mian's body, his limbs trembling as sweat flowed down his faceless visage.

"Master Wu Mian has been suppressed!" The crowd murmured, watching Luo Tian standing nearby. None expected Luo Tian to win so easily.

"Little... son..." Wu Mian trembled, trying to break free but was crushed tightly.

"I'll fight you!" Wu Mian roared. His aura surged, and people could clearly see his body expanding with swirling energies.

As Wu Mian unleashed his power, he finally broke free from the two forces' suppression.

"No use!" Luo Tian sneered, black qi surging as a roar echoed through the heavens. A colossal creature appeared before everyone's eyes.

Dragon-Elephant Sealing Prison...

The black elephant descended from the sky, its formidable aura causing Wu Mian's body to tremble again.

The Soul-Subjugating Seal, Dragon-Elephant Sealing Prison—both strongly suppressed ghosts. Combined with the Reincarnation Domain, they allowed Luo Tian to dominate all his peers in hell.

"Crack..." A crackling sound rose from Wu Mian's feet, cracks spreading as his legs quivered, as if carrying a mountain on his back.

"Ahh..." Wu Mian roared but remained motionless, sweat flowing from his feet.

"Boom..." Finally, the elephant's massive foot crushed down, colliding with Wu Mian's head. Wu Mian could no longer endure and collapsed.

"Finished..." Everyone gazed at Luo Tian standing there, stunned. None expected Luo Tian to be so formidable.

"So strong! Master Wu Mian was suppressed by a technique. What is that great seal? Why does it make me feel trembling in my soul!" Ghost disciples looked on fearfully, their souls shuddering under the aura of the Soul-Subjugating Seal. All believed Wu Mian was done, and if that elephant's foot had landed, Wu Mian would have died or been crushed to pieces.

"Boom..." Just as the elephant was about to descend, it suddenly shattered into violent fluctuations, sweeping outward. At the same time, the immense pressure vanished abruptly. Wu Mian slowly rose.

"What... what did you mean by that?" Wu Mian's voice echoed, surprised that the boy who once trembled before him had grown so strong.

"You are a hero. We are all disciples of the Reincarnation Pavilion. How could I kill you!" Luo Tian spoke softly, standing there with his robes fluttering gently as he gazed at Wu Mian.

Luo Tian held respect for soldiers. He knew Wu Mian hadn't become a general through status but by strength, surviving countless near-death battles and earning his position through glorious victories.

"Let's put the past behind us!" Wu Mian said, standing up and bowing to Luo Tian, fully acknowledging him.

"Who among you still doubts? Step forward! I'll stand here. If anyone dares challenge me, they're welcome!" Luo Tian bowed to Wu Mian and shouted at the crowd.

But after this, Luo Tian had no intention of letting anyone off easily. Without bloodshed, people wouldn't learn.

"Who dares?"

"When he was known as Luo Chen, he defeated the Eight Small Immortal Kings. Now he's back under a different name, but his strength is terrifying. Except for the Holy Maiden and the Immortal Lords, no one else could balance him!" The disciples of the Reincarnation Pavilion murmured.

"Plus, even Wu Mian couldn't match him!" People looked at Wu Mian walking down from the arena.

"He has a special suppression over ghosts. Though it's not as strong against ghost cultivators," Wu Mian said, but no one dared to step up. After all, the Reincarnation Pavilion had grown strong in recent years, and there weren't many Immortal Kings.

During Luo Tian's absence, a couple of young disciples had become Immortal Kings but dared not step up. Even with such an opportunity, they feared challenging Luo Tian's authority.

Luo Tian sat cross-legged on the arena, waiting for someone to challenge him.

"Ten Ghost King comes to pay respects to the Reincarnation Pavilion's leader!" A voice echoed from outside the pavilion, laced with anger.

"Ten Ghost King!" Hearing this, people murmured in shock. They hadn't expected the Ten Ghost King to arrive.

"Beast Ghost King comes to pay respects to the Reincarnation Pavilion's leader. Mountain Ghost King Qiu Long pays respects to the Reincarnation Pavilion's leader..." More voices echoed, and powerful auras gathered at the pavilion's gate.

"Eight Major Ghost Kings have all arrived!" A moment later, people were in chaos, hearing the greetings.

"Equal Pavilion's elder comes to pay respects to the Reincarnation Pavilion..." As the Eight Major Ghost Kings' words faded, more aged voices echoed. The elders of the Ten Yama's Court...

People were speechless. Though the Ten Yama's Court hadn't personally arrived, these elders were renowned and formidable in hell.

"Why have they come?" Almost all disciples of the Reincarnation Pavilion looked at Luo Tian, who had just opened his eyes slowly.

"Respected guests have arrived. Please enter my Reincarnation Pavilion!" An aged voice echoed, and four figures appeared—one at the late Immortal King stage, two at the middle stage, and one at the early stage.

Jueying Immortal Lord Cheng Bei, a late-stage Immortal King. He was the other late-stage Immortal King of the Reincarnation Pavilion, aside from Dujian Tianzun Du Jianxing.

Du Jianxing had taken three other Immortal Lords to the Fire Sea Hell, leaving four Immortal Lords behind in the Reincarnation Pavilion. With control over two hells, the Reincarnation Pavilion's strength had increased significantly, and high-level Immortal Kings had also grown.

Since the Ten Yama's Court hadn't arrived personally, neither would Yanluo's two officials. Thus, Jueying Immortal Lord had to lead people to welcome them.

Four strong figures smiled on the surface but secretly cursed these visitors for coming with ill intent.

Luo Tian followed the Reincarnation Pavilion's disciples out of the pavilion, gazing at the powerful figures outside.

"Unknown guests have arrived. What business do you have?" Jueying Immortal Lord Cheng Bei spoke, his voice ethereal like a breeze.

"Having heard that the Reincarnation Pavilion's Holy Disciple is an Immortal Realm cultivator, we've come to see!" Ten Ghost King Duan Zijue's gaze deepened as he saw Luo Tian among the crowd.

"Guests with ill intent!" Upon hearing Ten Ghost King's words, Reincarnation Pavilion disciples immediately understood. These people were using Luo Tian's status as an Immortal Realm cultivator to cause trouble for the Reincarnation Pavilion. Though the Ten Yama's Court hadn't arrived, these elders coming were enough to indicate the issue.

"This is our Reincarnation Pavilion's matter. It has nothing to do with you, right?" Jueying Immortal Lord frowned slightly, gazing at them.

"Hel, the Hell and the Immortal Realm are incompatible. This Luo Tian holds a high position in the Immortal Realm. I think it's better to eliminate him!"

"We, the Eight Major Ghost Kings, are not under the Reincarnation Pavilion's control. We even have supervision over the Ten Yama. If the Reincarnation Pavilion does anything harmful to Hell, we can intervene. Have you forgotten this?" Ten Ghost King coldly spoke. Though Jueying Immortal Lord was stronger, he wasn't afraid of Ten Ghost King.

Chapter 2485: Battle Against the Ten Ghost King

Upon hearing Ten Ghost King's words, Jueying Immortal Lord and others' faces slightly changed. They hadn't expected Ten Ghost King to say such words. Reincarnation Pavilion disciples were momentarily stunned, surprised that Ten Ghost King spoke so boldly and dared to confront Jueying Immortal Lord.

Supervision? Jueying Immortal Lord's face darkened. He knew Ten Ghost King was right. Originally, Hell wasn't ruled solely by the Ten Yama; the Eight Major Ghost Kings were equally powerful. Together, they had founded Hell.

Though the Ten Yama ruled Hell, the Eight Major Ghost Kings held supervision duties. However, since the positions were hereditary, the Eight Major Ghost Kings' strength had gradually weakened.

In contrast, the Ten Yama were merit-based, with the strong surviving. Thus, the Ten Yama had developed into their current state, while the Eight Major Ghost Kings had gradually weakened. Though weak, they still had deep roots.

This matter was rarely known; only the current Pavilion Masters and Ghost Kings knew. The Ghost Kings seemed to have special means, keeping the Ten Yama in check.

Luo Tian's gaze swept over the crowd, spotting many old acquaintances. He sighed inwardly; during his absence, these people had grown quickly—Wang Gang, Qiu Long, Mo Tian, etc. But he hadn't seen one person—Su Dan, the woman who had left a deep impression on him.

"You wish to do what?" Jueying Immortal Lord spoke, his gaze cold.

"Eliminate!" A young man spoke up, wearing a white robe. His appearance was handsome with cold eyes gazing at Luo Tian.

Back then, Wang Heng had died in the Reincarnation Pool. Though not killed by Luo Tian, many suspected it was related to him. After Wang Heng's death, Yuan Ghost King naturally had to cultivate his son—Wang Cheng appeared.

Wang Cheng, the new Yuan Ghost King, was Wang Heng's younger brother and the successor cultivated by Yuan Ghost King. Thus, Wang Cheng had come under Old Yuan Ghost King's instructions to assist Ten Ghost King and eliminate Luo Tian.

The old generation of Ghost Kings had only Duan Zijue come, watching others' successors. Duan Zijue felt even more bitter; his hatred for Luo Tian deepened.

"Ten Ghost King!" Beside Luo Tian, Luoshui's eyes turned blood-red. He stared fiercely at Ten Ghost King; his hatred for the clan's destruction would never fade. He lived only to avenge.

"Oh? The remnants of Luo Clan are here too!" Ten Ghost King smiled, gazing at Luoshui with disdain.

"Still a complete failure. You haven't improved in years!" Ten Ghost King coldly spoke.

"You've improved? Just a mid-stage Immortal King!" Seeing Ten Ghost King speaking of Luoshui, Luo Tian couldn't let it slide and retaliated.

"Even if I haven't improved, killing you is like crushing an ant. If you have confidence, don't hide behind people and fight me directly!" Ten Ghost King sneered.

"Back then, when Luo Clan was destroyed, I felt quite comfortable. I can let Luoshui go, but you must die. Even Yanluo's two officials couldn't stop your death!" Ten Ghost King shouted, his face twisted.

Though Ten Ghost King was cruel and lustful, he knew the saying "three filial piety: no offspring is the greatest." But now he had no descendants. His lineage had lasted until him, and it was broken.

Hearing Ten Ghost King's words, Luo Tian clenched his fists. Luoshui wanted to rush out and fight Ten Ghost King but was pulled back by Luo Tian.

"Those eyes of the dead, oh right, there was a woman who had some beauty. I enjoyed her briefly and then gave her to my subordinates!"

"Also a little child, just born, was crushed by my old steward's finger. Boom!" Ten Ghost King laughed lightly, gazing at Luoshui and Luo Tian.

"Breath... " Luoshui's breathing was heavy, his roar to break free from Luo Tian's grip, his expression twisted.

Luo Tian's forehead had veins popping out. He knew Ten Ghost King was provoking him and them, giving him an excuse to attack.

"Did you know how your offspring and the treasures of Ten Ghost King City disappeared?" Luo Tian took a deep breath, his gaze becoming profound as he spoke to Ten Ghost King.

Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Ten Ghost King's body suddenly trembled. Looking at the depth in Luo Tian's eyes, he recalled his offspring's tragic deaths years ago.

"Impossible!" The next moment, Ten Ghost King exclaimed. Back then, Luo Tian was a minor half-step Immortal King—how could he escape his divine awareness?

"Think you're a god?" Luo Tian scoffed. Whether Ten Ghost King believed it or not, he would be angry.

"Someone named Duan Hun? Or Duan Peng? Honestly, I think I left two for you. Did those two also die?" Luo Tian spoke, making Ten Ghost King's face turn dark.

"Really you!" Ten Ghost King's breath quickened. Back then, Luo Tian had stolen his treasures and killed him without descendants. Though he left three or so, they looked good but died within a few years.

"Good name you have, Duan Zijue—cut off the descendants!" Luo Tian spoke endlessly, causing people to murmur.

"Indeed, it was Luo Tian who infiltrated Ten Ghost King City and killed everyone!" Several Ghost Kings and elders looked surprised, not expecting Luo Tian to have been so ruthless before.

"Unfortunately, the Supplement Stone isn't here. Where did it go?" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, feeling he had lost so much—some memories were blank.

"You dare to seek death!" Ten Ghost King roared, spitting out a gray toxic dragon that surged toward Luo Tian.

"Ten Ghost King, you're overstepping!" Jueying Immortal Lord bellowed. Luo Tian was a Holy Disciple marked by Yanluo, so they wouldn't ignore it.

Even if Yanluo didn't value Luo Tian, a Holy Disciple in the Reincarnation Pavilion being killed would be a disgrace. It was their own matter, but if others attacked Luo Tian, they definitely wouldn't allow it.

Jueying Immortal Lord's speed was strange. He instantly appeared in front of Luo Tian, his ten-thousand-zhang domain suddenly enveloping him. His late-stage Immortal King power erupted, and he slapped the toxic dragon.

"Boom..." The dragon disintegrated into toxic smoke. Jueying Immortal Lord stretched his hand, tearing the sky open. The gray toxic gas flew into the void.

"Ten Ghost King, don't take it for granted!" Jueying Immortal Lord bellowed, his gaze filled with anger. It seemed today's matter would escalate.

"Immortal Realm cultivators are incompatible with Hell. This is Hell's rule. Are you going to break it?" Ten Ghost King gritted his teeth, knowing he couldn't be strong. He had come to pressure the Reincarnation Pavilion.

"I said it's our Reincarnation Pavilion's matter. You have no right to interfere!" Jueying Immortal Lord spoke strongly.

"Although that's true, the Eight Major Ghost Kings do have supervision over our courts. If three or more agree, we other courts will also act. This is the rule set by our ancestors. Rules must not be broken!" An old man from the Yin Shen Pavilion spoke, his eyes narrowed.

"Yes, Ten Ghost King, Yuan Ghost King, and Shang Ghost King have agreed to eliminate Luo Tian. Therefore, please abide by the ancestors' teachings and respect their legacy; don't disappoint the Eight Major Ghost Kings!" Other court elders also spoke.

"Take back Hell, you won't let it out!" Several court strong figures inwardly sneered. They knew the Reincarnation Pavilion couldn't be destroyed unless all courts joined forces. Their purpose here was to force the Reincarnation Pavilion to return the Fire Sea Hell it had gained in the prison battle.

Jueying Immortal Lord and others' faces darkened, knowing these people had ill intent. But with the situation so big, it seemed to be heading toward bloodshed. If they could kill, Jueying Immortal Lord would have killed Ten Ghost King already.

The atmosphere became oppressive. People watched Ten Ghost King and the Reincarnation Pavilion's people, their gazes playful.

"Killing me is impossible!"

"But I can give you a chance. Kill me, just like the Reincarnation Pavilion's disciples did—single combat on the arena, fate decides!" Luo Tian sneered, his calm voice echoing.

"What? I didn't hear right?" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, people were in chaos. None expected Luo Tian to say such a thing.

"What's the difference between this and seeking death?" Several Ghost Kings looked at Luo Tian, especially Mo Tian and Wang Gang. They knew Luo Tian's strength well but an early-stage Immortal King vs. a mid-stage one was too big.

"Luo Tian, don't be foolish. Go back!" Jueying Immortal Lord bellowed, also not believing Luo Tian could defeat Ten Ghost King.

"I agree!" Ten Ghost King quickly accepted, as if he had found a big deal, fearing Luo Tian would change his mind.

"Then let's go!" Luo Tian turned and ignored others, walking toward the arena where he had fought Wu Mian.

"Because you're so eager to die, I'll make your death long!" Ten Ghost King sneered, flying up and following Luo Tian.

"Let's go. The Pavilion Master hasn't said anything. It should be fine!" Jueying Immortal Lord frowned slightly, addressing the worried elders.

"Good show is coming!" Other Ghost Kings and Ten Yama elders looked on playfully, approaching the arena.

"Come on!" Luo Tian stood there, gazing at Ten Ghost King. People couldn't read what he was thinking or what techniques he had to challenge Ten Ghost King, for Ten Ghost King wasn't like Wu Mian.

"Kill..." As soon as he stepped onto the arena, Ten Ghost King rushed toward Luo Tian. His gray hand corroded heaven and earth, crushing toward Luo Tian.

"Poison Heart Palm—this is a more terrifying poison technique than the Five Poisons. It seems Ten Ghost King really hates him to the core, launching a powerful killing move right away!" The Ten Yama elders' faces showed shock, gazing at the fierce attack from Ten Ghost King.

Chapter 2486: The Soul-Reviving Grass

The gray hand crushed toward Luo Tian, making his face change. He retreated, hands forming seals. A green seal flew from his body. At the same time, a black vortex appeared in the sky, and black ghost claws surged toward the gray hand.

"Boom..." The prison ghost claw shattered, but the gray hand still crushed toward Luo Tian.

"It's over!" People's faces showed admiration. Ten Ghost King's single move could kill Luo Tian, as the poison palm contained overwhelming poison. But Luo Tian's face showed a smile. Above his head, the green seal radiated divine laws, invisible waves spreading outward.

"Is he not going to fight back?" People's gazes showed confusion, watching Luo Tian. Though Luo Tian and Ten Ghost King differed by a level, with his previous battle against Wu Mian's strength, he couldn't have no ability to fight back.

"Rest easy. This strike won't kill you, only cause pain. I'll kill you thoroughly!" Ten Ghost King bellowed, his eyes filled with cruelty.

"Roar..." Just as Ten Ghost King's words finished, people thought Luo Tian was doomed. But a roar rose from the Reincarnation Pavilion's Ghost-Feeding Hall, fierce energy surging. A green light flashed and appeared before Luo Tian, a massive body blocking the approaching poison palm.

"Boom..." Sharp claws directly shattered the gray poison palm. The澎湃 toxic gas turned into gray smoke, swirling outward.

"What is this!" People murmured in shock, watching the massive creature before Luo Tian. Their gazes showed disbelief, then suddenly remembered a battle from long ago—when Luo Tian had fought against the Fire Lord.

The massive body resembled a giant snake but had wings on its belly and four thick claws.

"Ten Ghost Beast, the third-level beast in the Reincarnation Pavilion's Ghost-Feeding Hall. The Soul-Subjugating Lord raised this ghost beast. But the Soul-Subjugating Lord isn't with the Poison Sword Lord in the Fire Sea Hell, so why is his beast appearing now!" Some confused Reincarnation Pavilion disciples murmured.

"Roar..." The Ten Ghost Beast opened its mouth, creating an invisible vortex that absorbed the gray toxic gas completely. People's mouths twitched.

"A mere beast, what can it do against me!" Ten Ghost King's face darkened. He still looked down on it, thinking that no matter how many fierce beasts there were, they wouldn't be his match.

"Roar..." But as Ten Ghost King was about to strike again, several figures appeared from the Ghost-Feeding Hall. More massive creatures emerged, each radiating terrifying energy.

"My god! That's Yin Xian... that's Xi Qu!" Reincarnation Pavilion disciples gasped, watching the fierce beasts radiating terrifying energy.

"Nine-Headed Bird!" Ten Ghost King's face also darkened, sensing a strong threat from these beasts. Especially two of them—a nine-headed bird and a beast like a bull—radiated mid-stage Immortal King energy.

"Kill him!" Luo Tian stood still, pointing at Ten Ghost King and commanding the fierce beasts.

"Roar..." Next moment, these massive creatures surged forward with overwhelming energy. Dust and smoke filled the air as they rushed toward Ten Ghost King.

"I remember now, back then Luo Tian used these beasts to humiliate the Fire Lord!" Some old Reincarnation Pavilion disciples' mouths twitched.

"Boom..." As people spoke, ten beasts reached Ten Ghost King. The bull's sharp horns pierced Ten Ghost King, knocking him back.

Lightning, wind, rain, snow, mist, ice, and frost—nine-headed bird's nine heads spat out nine waves. Like apocalyptic destruction, the entire arena was filled with these waves, surging toward Ten Ghost King.

Ten Ghost King was in trouble. He desperately fought back with toxic mist, but the gap was too big. The nine-headed bird and bull alone could suppress Ten Ghost King. Plus, other beasts were also there—especially the Ten Ghost Beast, which was extremely effective against him.

The sound of explosions echoed constantly. In no time, Ten Ghost King was in a terrible state, almost pierced through by the bull's horns. His body was also struck by several black divine lightning bolts, smoking and torn with blood flowing out.

"So pitiful! Is this Ten Ghost King?" People watched the beaten Ten Ghost King, their faces showing admiration. Ten Ghost King was a renowned figure in Hell, but now he looked so pitiful—unavoidable to sigh.

Time passed slowly. After an hour, Ten Ghost King was still being beaten. Finally, he couldn't endure and was wrapped by eight large snakes, carried to Luo Tian's front.

"Buzz..." Without hesitation, Luo Tian's black spear surged with terrifying power toward the dying Ten Ghost King.

"Impossible!" Seeing Luo Tian about to kill Ten Ghost King, Jueying Immortal Lord couldn't sit still. If Ten Ghost King died, other Ghost Kings would definitely be upset.

The Eight Major Ghost Kings were hereditary positions. They had given up ruling Hell to ensure their descendants could inherit. Otherwise, it wouldn't be the Ten Yama but eighteen forces each controlling a Hell. If Ten Ghost King died, it would be the Reincarnation Pavilion breaking ancestors' will and facing可怕的 backlash. Also, other Ghost Kings and Ten Yama wouldn't agree.

Jueying Immortal Lord moved. His figure flashed, becoming a blur and instantly appearing in front of Ten Ghost King. He grabbed the black spear.

"Ah?" Luo Tian frowned slightly, gazing at Jueying Immortal Lord with anger.

"He can't die!" Jueying Immortal Lord spoke to Luo Tian, seeing his anger but not moving a finger.

"Ha! Little fellow, kill me if you can!" Ten Ghost King laughed, his voice filled with arrogance.

"Crack... crack..." The black snakes slowly contracted, making Ten Ghost King's body emit cracking sounds. Blood continuously flowed from his mouth.

"Really can't kill?" Luo Tian asked Jueying Immortal Lord, also asking Yanluo's two officials. He knew they would be watching this matter.

"Really can't kill!" Jueying Immortal Lord spoke. But Yanluo's two officials didn't respond. No response meant Luo Tian understood, sighing inwardly.

"Ten Ghost King, I'll let you off this time. But your life will be mine someday!" Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Ten Ghost King's red face.

"Only you? If not for these beasts, I could have crushed you with one palm!" Ten Ghost King spoke while coughing blood, his breath quick.

"Good. I'll give you a chance. When your injuries heal, I'll come to Ten Ghost King City and we'll settle this!" Luo Tian shouted.

"You dare to come, I dare to fight!" Eight snakes slowly loosened their grip on Ten Ghost King, letting him lie on the ground. But he still spoke confidently.

Ten Ghost King was barely alive, his injuries severe. He wouldn't return to peak condition in half a year or so.

"Go! If you recover, let me know. We'll take your life!" Luo Tian spoke coldly and then gazed at the other Ghost Kings and elders.

"Who among you wants to eliminate me, Luo Tian?" Cold words made people curse inwardly. Watching the ten fierce beasts behind Luo Tian, who dared to challenge them would be suicide.

"Okay, if no one does, I'll leave!" Luo Tian bowed to everyone and walked toward his residence.

"Everyone, I've prepared wine. If you want to stay, please have a chat!" Jueying Immortal Lord smiled, leading the Ten Ghost King who was beaten half-dead. They had no reason to trouble them now, saying they prepared wine but actually didn't.

"Excuse me!" The Ten Yama elders sighed, bowing to Jueying Immortal Lord and others.

"It's been a while since I returned to the Reincarnation Pavilion. Immortal Lord, can I enter and take a look?" Wang Gang's face showed nostalgia as he spoke to Jueying Immortal Lord.

Mo Tian, Qiu Long, and others also showed nostalgia. After all, they had spent important times in the Reincarnation Pavilion.

At this moment, Luo Tian led those fierce beasts to the Ghost-Feeding Hall. He comforted them and went to the last level, appearing in the Reincarnation Hell.

As Luo Tian arrived, Yanluo's two officials' voices echoed in his and Fu Xingxuan's minds.

"You two come here. There's something to discuss!" Yanluo's two officials spoke, making Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan slightly startled.

They didn't dare to delay. They flew up, left the Ghost-Feeding Hall and entered the Reincarnation Pavilion. They reached the last level.

"I found out how to restore your memories!" Yanluo's two officials gazed at Luo Tian, speaking softly.

"Restore memories?" Upon hearing Yanluo's words, Luo Tian frowned slightly. Fu Xingxuan's face showed joy.

"But it's quite difficult. It requires a pill called the Soul-Reviving Pill!"

"And this pill is very hard to refine. It's a pill from the Immortal Realm, and we don't have it in Hell."

"The main ingredient is Soul-Reviving Grass. I know where it is—there's this grass in the Blood Wolf Valley!" Yanluo's two officials spoke to Luo Tian.

"You can go there. If you meet an Immortal Realm alchemist, maybe he can refine it and help you regain your memories!" Yanluo's two officials spoke to Luo Tian.

"Let it be. I'd rather focus on improving my strength. After all, there's another battle with Ten Ghost King. Next time, will you not stop me?" Luo Tian didn't care and gazed at Yanluo's two officials.

"Ah, but it's better for the two of you to swear blood oaths in advance. That would be more secure!" Yanluo's two officials spoke softly.

"You should go, I think you'll regret it if you don't!" Fu Xingxuan shook her head lightly, believing Luo Tian should recover his memories.

"Is that why you want me to regain my memories?" Luo Tian gazed at Fu Xingxuan, asking.

Chapter 2487: Blood Wolf Valley

"Yes, I do!" Fu Xingxuan nodded. She didn't want Luo Tian to regret it.

"Okay, I'll go!" Luo Tian nodded and wasn't in a hurry. He left Yanluo's residence, walking with Fu Xingxuan through the Reincarnation Pavilion.

"Back then, you killed Duan Boyang here!" They soon reached the thirty-third level of the Reincarnation Pavilion, chatting quietly.

After the battle with Ten Ghost King, the disciples of the Reincarnation Pavilion no longer resented Luo Tian. After all, he had protected the pavilion's face. Some people also remembered his past. Ultimately, in Hell, strength was supreme. Luo Tian had won the disciples' respect with his strength.

While walking, they saw a group of people—former small Ghost Kings who had walked through the Reincarnation Pavilion.

"Luo Brother!" Wang Gang smiled and bowed to Luo Tian. Others also greeted Luo Tian.

"Come, let's have a chat!" Mo Tian invited Luo Tian. He still had one eye.

Other small Ghost Kings also smiled, their faces showing joy. Their current status was no longer as before. Luo Tian, the Reincarnation Pavilion's Holy Disciple, seemed to be a certainty now. After so much, his status hadn't changed. They naturally wanted to make friends.

"Chat with you. I'll go back first!" Fu Xingxuan smiled lightly and walked toward the Ghost-Feeding Hall, returning to the Reincarnation Hell.

...

"I naturally want to be a good host!" Luo Tian watched Fu Xingxuan leave and smiled. He gazed at them, looking at Wang Cheng and the successor of the Yuan Ghost King. He didn't know them.

They were quite tactful, choosing to leave. After all, they had been on Ten Ghost King's side before and didn't know Luo Tian.

Qiu Long, Mo Tian, Wang Gang, Hong Tao, Mo Er—five people smiled. Some of them had conflicts with Luo Tian before but had resolved them later.

They chatted and laughed, walking through the Reincarnation Pavilion. But Luo Tian felt somewhat uncomfortable.

Though they had conflicts before, their personalities were once hot-blooded. But from the conversation, Luo Tian heard their caution and mutual suspicion.

The Reincarnation Pavilion disciples prepared a banquet. They sat there, chatting about past memories.

"Where is Su Dan? She was the successor of the Shang Ghost King, right? Why has it changed?" Luo Tian asked, trying to sound casual.

"Ah, you still remember Su Dan!" Wang Gang smiled lightly and took a sip of wine. Others also showed strange expressions, thinking about the past intimacy between Luo Tian and Su Dan.
