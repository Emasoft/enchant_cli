“Ah, I see now…” Luo Tian sighed. This realm, if its laws were complete, these souls would not exist, for there would be reincarnation to allow them rebirth.

“Wait! Reincarnation—can I do it!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with radiant light. His Reincarnation Fist could summon a reincarnation passage, fully capable of initiating rebirth. Then he could exit through the passage.

“I almost forgot—my Reincarnation Fist can also serve as an escape route. If I lose, I’ll initiate reincarnation and enter the passage to return to the Wheel of Rebirth. But rebirth itself holds dangers; I must not use it unless desperate,” Luo Tian mused, a faint smile creeping onto his face.

“Does this small world possess a World Heart?” Luo Tian asked again, concerned about the World Heart.

“No,” the soul sighed. “In the past, Huangquan Lord did obtain a World Heart to complete this small world. But for unknown reasons, there was no further progress.”

“By the way, in ancient times, countless strong ones emerged. Why did they all perish?” Luo Tian asked, voicing a question shared by many.

“What? They all perished?” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, several souls showed shock on their faces.

“It seems you know nothing either…” Luo Tian sighed, no longer questioning them. His gaze turned to the endless black mountains.

“Begin…” Yet soon, his excitement overtook him, and he stepped into the forest.

Chapter 2659: Ascending to Late Stage of Immortal King

Luo Tian entered the forest, guided by several souls to a small hill.

“Let’s start!” Seeing the hill, he took out his blood knife and slashed at it. Luo Tian held back his strength, fearing harm to the ghost vein.

Crack…

Stone shattered, Luo Tian’s control was perfect; a two-inch deep crack appeared in his view.

As the fissure formed, dark mist spewed from it, accompanied by a faint black glow.

“Tsk tsk, this is a big find!” Luo Tian activated his Thunder Yang Eye, observing beneath the stone skin—approximately several zhang of ghost crystal lay hidden.

Luo Tian soared into the sky, gazing at the forest while slowly gliding upward.

Several souls respectfully followed Luo Tian, unaware of his actions.

“Thousand zhang…” Luo Tian murmured, estimating the length of the immortal vein. His vision revealed a dragon-like imprint.

“This is enough for Tianyuan Sect!” Luo Tian muttered, his gaze turning toward the forest’s depths.

The ghost vein stretched a thousand zhang but was not at the forest’s core; it lay on its periphery. As for the depths, the souls did not know due to a natural cosmic barrier blocking them.

“First, secure this immortal vein!” Luo Tian’s lips curled into a grin, beginning a miner-like existence.

The clinking sounds of tools echoed constantly. Thanks to the Thunder Yang Eye, Luo Tian precisely avoided damaging the immortal vein.

Within a day, he excavated over a hundred zhang, revealing a black crystal stone about ten zhang in radius and a hundred zhang long.

The black stone radiated radiant spiritual light, surrounded by thick ghost qi. Its density rivaled that of the final thirty-three levels of the Wheel of Rebirth, even matching the location of the Black and White Judges.

“Ghost vein…” Several souls gazed at it, hovering above to absorb its essence, strengthening themselves. They knew this treasure would now belong to another.

“Kid, you’re overdoing it—using me to dig this!” Xue Zhu’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

“Senior, did I disturb you?” Luo Tian chuckled but kept working.

“I felt my bloodline’s aura… it’s here!” Xue Zhu’s voice carried confusion.

“What?” Luo Tian was stunned; he hadn’t expected to encounter Xue Zhu’s bloodline here.

“Is it Shu Shengfei?” Luo Tian guessed. Among those who ascended to the Immortal Realm, only two from the Xue Clan remained: Shu Yangfei and Xue Zhu’s son, Shu Shengfei.

Shu Yangfei joined the Tianyuan Sect but later vanished, though Luo Tian had seen him.

“You handle your affairs; it’s not far. I’ll check myself!” Xue Zhu replied, and his blood knife flew from Luo Tian’s hand toward the forest’s depths.

“Alas…” Luo Tian sighed; if it were indeed Shu Shengfei, Xue Zhu’s knife would leave him.

Yet Luo Tian was glad for Xue Zhu; they hadn’t seen each other in years, and a father-son reunion was worth it. Luo Tian wouldn’t hoard Xue Zhu’s knife, as he still had the Rupture Spear and the Broken Sword of Immortality. Xue Zhu had already aided him enough.

Luo Tian retrieved a middle-grade immortal artifact sword and resumed hacking.

Ten zhang… hundred zhang…

Time passed slowly; after seven days of relentless hacking, Luo Tian finally unearthed the entire ghost vein. Gazing at its thousand-zhang stretch, he laughed heartily.

During these days, Luo Tian had lost over a hundred ghost crystals due to slips, causing him great pain. Yet this was but a fraction of the vein’s bounty.

Luo Tian fed all those crystals into the Sinful Obstacle Mirror, finally filling it with three annihilating lights.

“With the ghost vein in hand, I command the world!” Luo Tian laughed; with the ghost vein’s presence, replenishing the Sinful Obstacle Mirror was no longer an issue. Thus, Luo Tian could freely expend its annihilating light.

Laughing, he stored the ghost vein and gazed at the forest’s depths without entering it. Instead, he stepped out to look at the drifting souls.

Without this ghost vein, Luo Tian could clearly sense the realm’s ghost qi had thinned considerably.

“Reincarnation!” Luo Tian punched, and the world trembled; a massive passage appeared in the sky.

“Roar…” As the passage formed, all the souls in the realm erupted into chaos, surging skyward and surrounding the passage with fervent roars.

“This place is no longer suitable for you; I’ve taken the ghost vein, and I return your reincarnation!” Luo Tian spoke softly. Even the several kings-level souls following him showed longing.

Luo Tian pointed, shattering a piece of the gray passage; waves radiated outward, drawing in suction.

“Hope you’re lucky!” Luo Tian chuckled, and the gray souls rushed into the passage.

Yet each soul let out a painful cry before entering, emitting waves of power—its cultivation strength.

Luo Tian had granted them rebirth; they naturally repaid the favor, knowing reincarnation from ancient times.

Though their cultivation was weak, their numbers were vast; they coalesced into a black vortex descending from the sky toward Luo Tian.

“Thank you!” Luo Tian smiled, watching the souls enter the passage without hesitation, and sat cross-legged on the ground to absorb the vortex.

Time passed slowly; after a day, the realm quieted. The gray souls circling the world vanished, leaving only those kings-level souls with conflicted eyes.

The vortex above Luo Tian’s head also disappeared, and his body emitted thunderous sounds.

In Luo Tian’s dantian, demonic energy surged; the ninth demon platform coalesced, radiating terrifying power.

“Late Stage of Immortal King!”

Luo Tian had been close to this stage for a long time. If not for various reasons, he would have entered the Late Stage of Immortal King long ago.

This influx of cultivation strength had seamlessly elevated him to the Late Stage of Immortal King. Luo Tian opened his eyes, a joyous expression on his face. He stood up, and the winds converged. With a single finger, he sealed the reincarnation passage, which eventually vanished into the heavens.

Chapter 2660: The Soul of an Emperor

Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with intense joy, standing amidst the world. His strength had advanced again; at the Late Stage of Immortal King, he could accomplish much. At present, only a few in the immortal realm had reached this stage.

“Let’s go…” Luo Tian moved swiftly, heading toward the forest’s depths to find Xue Zhu.

Luo Tian’s speed was fast; after a quarter-hour of traversing the forest, he reached a black barrier.

Luo Tian stood before it, his eyes grave; the barrier exuded immense pressure, as if the heavens and earth had combined to form a chasm.

Yet this barrier was no challenge for Luo Tian, even if it were formed by cosmic forces.

Luo Tian took a step forward, crossing the barrier. The surrounding scenery shifted violently, and collision sounds echoed in his ears.

Blood sea surged; the entire realm turned blood-red, with waves of soul energy swirling into martial arts that clashed against the blood sea.

Not far from where he appeared stood a figure holding a blood knife, continuously slashing. However, this figure had its eyes closed.

“Luo Tian!” The blood sea churned, forming a figure—Xue Zhu himself. Simultaneously, the formidable soul energy coalesced into an old man’s form.

Yet the old man’s aura sent a tremor through Luo Tian; it was an absolute suppression. Any immortal king would be crushed before this aura.

Luo Tian could clearly see the blood sea had dimmed significantly, and the figure standing with closed eyes and continuously slashing was Shu Shengfei—Xue Zhu’s son.

At the center of the blood sea stood a black altar, with nine chains binding a gray figure.

“What?” Luo Tian’s heart jolted; the bound figure was far stronger than the one battling the blood sea. Yet nine chains restricted its movements, rendering it immobile.

“Another one came?” The gray figure spoke softly upon seeing Luo Tian.

“The Soul of an Emperor!” Luo Tian couldn’t help but exclaim; the absolute suppression felt was undeniable. As a soul master, he had reached the Late Stage of Immortal King. Even an immortal king at its peak would be suppressed before this figure.

Yet Luo Tian felt his own suppression, as if he were碾压 any true immortal.

“Kid, don’t be surprised; destroy this fragment!” Xue Zhu’s voice echoed, snapping Luo Tian back to his senses.

“Just you two ants dare to kill me? Even Huangquan couldn’t destroy me, only severing my flesh and imprisoning my soul here. What are you two?” The cold voice echoed; the gray figure saw Luo Tian and Xue Zhu knew each other, so it didn’t waste words but transformed into soul energy to attack Xue Zhu.

“First, send this kid out; then return and help me!” Luo Tian was about to act when Xue Zhu shouted, ordering Luo Tian to send Shu Shengfei out.

“Fine!” Luo Tian also sensed something was wrong with Shu Shengfei and soared upward, approaching him. He pointed a finger, striking Shu Shengfei.

Shu Shengfei immediately punched Luo Tian away, and Luo Tian simultaneously cast a hundred-ghost seal, imprinting it on Shu Shengfei.

“Take him down too!” The cold voice echoed; the soul energy battling Xue Zhu split some of its power, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Take me down? You’re not worthy!” Seeing the soul energy approaching, Luo Tian’s face showed disdain.

If the figure on the altar descended, Luo Tian couldn’t fight it. But this was a fragment; its strength was several times weaker than the altar-bound figure. Though it was a fragment of a fragment, Luo Tian could still defeat it.

In an instant, Luo Tian pointed his finger, soul energy surged; a gray hand crushed the gray figure.

One finger shattered the soul, turning it into swirling ash that spread in all directions.

“How is this possible?” The soul energy battling Xue Zhu’s fragment was shocked, not expecting its own fragment to be so easily crushed.

At the same time, Luo Tian’s hundred-ghost seal completed; Shu Shengfei stopped slashing. Luo Tian grabbed him and rushed toward the barrier’s exterior.

Luo Tian’s seal dragon bound Shu Shengfei, then turned back into the barrier.

The blood sea covered everything; the sky darkened, waves of blood surged toward the fragment.

“Senior, I’m coming!” Luo Tian shouted; he could feel Xue Zhu’s weakness. This fragment was no easy opponent.

In an instant, Luo Tian’s gray soul left his body; he had no confidence, as this fragment was not to be trifled with. Its aura carried that of an emperor.

The gray soul was solid, and ten-colored flames erupted from Luo Tian’s body, surrounding him.

Luo Tian soared upward; ten-colored fire dragons surged in all directions toward the fragment, while his gray hands cast soul seals. A soul spear materialized in his hand and pierced the fragment.

“Trivial tricks!” The fragment saw Luo Tian’s spear, unimpressed. It raised a hand, summoning a gray soul knife to slash toward Luo Tian.

The gray blade’s aura was formidable, causing Luo Tian’s face to change; in an instant, the blade shattered the ten-colored flames and collided with Luo Tian’s spear.

Boom…

The thunderous explosion shook, and Luo Tian’s soul was thrown back; his澎湃 soul energy shattered before him.

“Blood War Across the Eight Directions!” On another side, Xue Zhu’s attack had also reached its peak. He had fought this fragment for a while and knew its strength.

The blood-colored long knife descended, bloodlight swirling; it instantly landed on the fragment’s head.

The fragment saw the descending blade and punched, colliding with it; one punch shattered the blood-colored knife.

“How could it be so strong!” Luo Tian marveled at the blood-colored knife’s destruction, his heart shocked.

“Its soul strength is currently at the peak of kings; however, since it’s a fragment of an emperor, it surpasses us.”

“Can’t fight, so run!” Luo Tian replied; the ten-colored flames returned to his front. He felt no need to fight this formidable opponent, as it was closely tied to the emperor.

“Can’t escape; he controls the barrier. You’re unaffected, but I am. Plus, Shengfei’s soul is with him!”屠天’s bitter voice echoed.

Chapter 2661: Reencountering Ye Huo

“This is a problem!” Luo Tian sighed internally; his soul spear reformed, rushing toward the fragment.

The battle resumed; the fragment showed no fear, its soul energy surging endlessly against Luo Tian and Xue Zhu. It seemed to have infinite strength.

Soul battles depend on soul grade and energy consumption; currently, neither Luo Tian nor Xue Zhu held an advantage.

“Wear them down!” The fragment sneered, gathering soul energy to attack Luo Tian and Xue Zhu.

Though they could currently withstand it, if the battle prolonged, they would be worn down.

“Must get Shengfei out!” Xue Zhu’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, making him startle.

Boom…

Luo Tian’s momentary hesitation resulted in a soul energy fist striking him, shattering the ten-colored flames before him and sending his soul back, nearly returning to his body.

“Blood Sea Burns the Heavens!”

“Even if you are an ancient emperor, I will fight! For I am Xue Zhu!” The cold and authoritative voice echoed within the barrier.

Rippling…

The blood sea seemed ignited, rapidly boiling.

“Senior, stop!” Luo Tian saw Xue Zhu’s intent to fight to the death and shouted, his soul returning to his body.

Buzz…

Yellow light flashed; Luo Tian immediately retrieved the Sinful Obstacle Mirror, standing before him.

“Time to use you!” Luo Tian lightly patted the mirror and, as the boiling blood sea calmed, it quieted.

“Hmph?” The fragment frowned upon seeing Luo Tian retrieve the mirror but remained confident, believing Luo Tian couldn’t truly harm it.

The blood sea receded, returning to the barrier’s corner, forming Xue Zhu’s shape. Blood-colored eyes gazed at the Sinful Obstacle Mirror before Luo Tian.

“Go!” Luo Tian activated his cultivation, and a wave radiated from the mirror, divine light erupting. Annihilation light burst forth, striking the fragment.

The annihilating light’s speed was incredible; the fragment had previously looked down on Luo Tian and Xue Zhu but, upon seeing the divine light, its body trembled.

When it realized, it was too late; golden divine light struck its body.

“Ah…” A piercing scream echoed, and the entire barrier seemed to illuminate solely with this light.

The divine light lasted a few seconds before calming; Luo Tian gazed at the fragment’s direction, his eyes slightly narrowing.

“This still doesn’t kill it!” Xue Zhu’s eyes also showed shock; the annihilating light had been enough for him to feel he couldn’t withstand it.

Though the fragment wasn’t killed, Luo Tian and Xue Zhu sensed its weakness.

“Excellent, it was worth the cost!” Luo Tian mused, surprised by the annihilating light’s power.

This soul seemed merely a soul but its strength surpassed even an immortal king peak. The annihilating light’s ability to wound it proved it could harm an immortal king peak and eliminate a late-stage immortal king.

“Is this the annihilating light of the One-Eyed Giant?” The fragment sighed, gazing at Luo Tian, surprised he had mastered such an attack.

“But you can only unleash three more; I won’t be killed!” The fragment’s eyes showed disdain, clearly knowing the One-Eyed Giant. Its words ended, and the Sinful Obstacle Mirror radiated another wave.

Annihilating light rose; the fragment’s face turned serious, its hands forming seals. A gray soul shield materialized before it, covered in complex runes.

Buzz…

In an instant, the divine light struck the soul shield, causing Luo Tian to sigh in admiration for the fragment’s strength. The first hit was due to carelessness.

Crack…

Even with the shield, it couldn’t block the annihilating light; the gray shield shattered, and the weakened divine light struck the fragment’s body, sending it back.

“Last one; I’ll block it and still kill both of you!” The fragment sneered, its body dimming further, gray eyes gazing at Luo Tian and Xue Zhu.

“Be careful; don’t kill him, Shengfei is still with him!” Xue Zhu transmitted mentally to Luo Tian; his only concern was Shengfei’s safety.

“Hmph, he won’t die; he definitely won’t!” Luo Tian replied, again activating the Sinful Obstacle Mirror to unleash a third annihilating light while secretly channeling the ghost vein to replenish it.

“Move!” The fragment roared, its gray body vanishing from the spot; its speed was incredible, evading the annihilating light.

“How fast!” Luo Tian marveled; if this fragment was so strong, the main soul on the altar would be beyond their capacity to withstand.

Luo Tian rotated the Sinful Obstacle Mirror, chasing the fragment, but its speed was too fast for Luo Tian to match.

“Open!” After thirty seconds, the annihilating light weakened, and the fragment’s body appeared. It swung a soul sword, striking the annihilating light.

The collision sound echoed; the fragment retreated, its soul sword shattered, and the annihilating light dispersed.

“Now it’s my turn!” The fragment growled, its eyes flashing red; its aura surged again, gray soul seemingly ignited. A crimson flame rose from the fragment’s body.

At the moment the flame appeared, Luo Tian’s face changed; he recognized this fire.

Ye Huo!

Luo Tian identified the red flame, recalling what Maque had once told him about Ye Huo’s crimson lotus.

“How is this possible!” Luo Tian couldn’t help but exclaim, recalling Maque’s words.

Maque’s Ye Huo was a life-fire; it was even closer to him and Qixi than the dragon bird clan’s. It was innate from birth!

Others wanting Ye Huo had to kill, and the more they killed, the stronger their Ye Qi became. When reaching a terrifying number, Ye Qi would transform into Ye Huo, burning the killer and ultimately killing them.

But this method was rarely used; one, it took countless kills to produce Ye Huo, and two, few could withstand Ye Huo’s burning. Even masters couldn’t. Yet this fragment had mastered Ye Huo, indicating the emperor’s past was truly extraordinary.

Chapter 2662: Again!

As the fragment’s Ye Huo surged, Luo Tian again activated the Sinful Obstacle Mirror, unleashing annihilating light.

Upon seeing this, the fragment trembled; its gray eyes filled with shock, unable to help but exclaim: “How is this possible!”

The fragment was an ancient emperor, one who even Huangquan couldn’t kill. Its knowledge was vast and knew the One-Eyed Giant’s annihilating light could only be unleashed three times.

Rippling…

The red, blood-like flames surged before the fragment, colliding with the annihilating light. Two powerful energies clashed endlessly.

“You still have how many?” The fragment’s face showed ferocity, believing Luo Tian couldn’t unleash too many annihilating lights; otherwise, it would be absurd.

“How many can your Ye Huo endure?” Luo Tian sneered, patting the Sinful Obstacle Mirror and unleashing another annihilating light toward the fragment.

“I’ll block…” The fragment roared, its red flames rising again to clash with the annihilating light.

The collision continued; divine light and Ye Huo wore each other down before the fragment, while both hearts were confident they could wear the other down.

“My money…” Luo Tian mentally cried; each annihilating light consumed the ghost vein, a terrifying number that made him心疼.

The fragment was shocked Luo Tian could unleash so many annihilating lights; its red Ye Huo had weakened, no longer as fierce as before.

Its Ye Huo was formed by killing; it was hard to control. This ancient emperor had mastered it without burning himself, which was already extraordinary; let alone controlling it.

One… ten…

After over a dozen divine lights, Luo Tian finally stopped; the fragment’s Ye Huo was now weak.

“Come on, why don’t you continue!” Seeing Luo Tian stop, the fragment’s eyes showed joy, guessing Luo Tian had reached his limit.

“You come on, dare to continue fighting me!”

“Old man, I pity your cultivation; thus, I stopped. Let’s negotiate. Give me the boy’s soul, and we’ll leave; no more conflict, okay?” Luo Tian addressed the fragment, too心疼 from this moment’s thousands of ghost crystals.

“Dream on; kill!” The fragment roared, eyes filled with joy. Who was it? An ancient emperor who dominated the world; today, he had been pushed to this by a seemingly insignificant Luo Tian.

The blood-colored flames surged, striking toward Luo Tian as a fire dragon, rising into the sky.

“Old man, must we fight to the death!” Luo Tian raised his hand, unleashing another annihilating light that shattered the fire dragon, vanishing from view.

“Kid, how rich he is!” Xue Zhu’s heart trembled, watching Luo Tian waste annihilating lights like they were nothing.

About the Sinful Obstacle Mirror and annihilating light, Xue Zhu was clear; he also knew the cost of annihilating light.

“Still more!”

“But it shouldn’t be many now,” the fragment felt a chill, still believing Luo Tian couldn’t unleash more.

“Again!” The fragment roared, the blood-colored flames surging again toward Luo Tian.

“You, good talk isn’t possible!” Luo Tian cursed; forced to act, he again activated the Sinful Obstacle Mirror.

The battle resumed, another ten annihilating lights consumed, making Luo Tian’s heart bleed; his eyes showed ferocity as he gazed at the fragment.

“This time, you won’t be able to stop; I’ll definitely kill you!” Luo Tian growled, no longer fearing waste. He activated the Sinful Obstacle Mirror to attack the fragment.

“Last stand; dare to act before me!” The fragment saw Luo Tian’s demeanor, thinking he was forcing it. Ye Huo surged again toward the annihilating light.

Time passed; after dozens of seconds, Luo Tian unleashed ten more annihilating lights, and he kept attacking. This made the fragment nervous.

“How is this possible… I don’t believe it!” The fragment’s heart was shocked, not knowing why Luo Tian could still unleash so many; he couldn’t stop.

Another five annihilating lights, the fragment’s red flames finally disappeared, leaving only a palm-sized flame flickering before it.

“Little brother, let’s talk nicely!” The fragment finally trembled; its body moved to dodge Luo Tian’s attacks.

“F*** your grandma, I don’t have time!” Luo Tian cursed; he controlled the annihilating light to continue attacking the fragment.

The fragment was strong, but even if it had once been an emperor, now it was just a lingering soul. How could it withstand?

Within dozens of seconds, the fragment’s last palm-sized Ye Huo also disappeared; golden divine light struck the fragment.

“Ah…” A piercing scream echoed, and the fragment screamed, flying back to the altar.

“Don’t run, face me!” Luo Tian shouted, his voice filled with anger; he had suffered heavy losses in this moment. He couldn’t let the fragment escape.

The golden divine light struck the fragment, further weakening it by three-tenths; its gray eyes showed fear toward Luo Tian.

“Kid, I’ll let him go; you both leave!” The fragment spoke to Luo Tian, voice weak.

Hearing the fragment’s words, a furious Luo Tian stopped his hand; he couldn’t ignore Xue Zhu and Shengfei’s concerns. That was his main goal.

“Where is his soul?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow; if Shengfei’s soul was devoured, they had no reason to waste time.

“On his main soul!” Xue Zhu gazed at the powerful soul bound by chains on the altar.

“Main soul?” Luo Tian’s eyes slightly narrowed; actually, what he feared most was this emperor’s main soul.

Seeing Luo Tian stop fighting, the fragment took a breath, anxiously watching Luo Tian, fearing he would attack again.

“Done…” Upon careful observation, Luo Tian’s face changed; Xue Zhu’s eyes also turned angry.

The solid soul on the altar radiated a powerful aura, and Luo Tian and Xue Zhu could clearly feel it was merging with another weaker soul.

“You’re dead; you used Shengfei’s soul to replace his fragment!” Xue Zhu roared, ready to fight the fragment.

Buzz…

Divine light again; Luo Tian raised his hand, unleashing annihilating light toward the fragment.

“Ah…” Screams echoed; the fragment’s gray soul force scattered, and it fell.

“You have a way to extract that soul?” Luo Tian coldly asked, gazing at the weak fragment.

Chapter 2663: Do You Think You’re Who?

“I…” The fragment stood there, extremely weak; it no longer had its former strength. Its gaze turned to Luo Tian and Xue Zhu.

“You can’t!” Luo Tian’s face darkened; as a soul master, he knew how difficult it was to separate two fused souls, especially one from an emperor.

“Do you have a way?” Xue Zhu gazed at Luo Tian, eyes filled with hope. At this moment, Xue Zhu was no longer strong and domineering but resembled a father desperate to save his child.

“I can only try!” Luo Tian replied, gazing at the fragment.

“Do you want to live or die?” Luo Tian patted the Sinful Obstacle Mirror, aiming to rescue Shengfei’s soul; it required this fragment’s cooperation.

“I certainly want to live…” The fragment spoke, now weak and no longer the match for Luo Tian and Xue Zhu. A bad premonition arose in its mind.

“Then go back to your main soul!” Luo Tian shouted, and a spiritual force flew from his hand onto the fragment.

The refining power began to refine the fragment; it struggled violently, but now it was weak and had been wounded by annihilating light. Luo Tian wouldn’t give it a chance to escape.

The fragment roared, seemingly understanding Luo Tian’s plan; it had barely escaped confinement and didn’t want to return.

“You could’ve run at the start; I might not have been able to stop you. But now, you’re trash!” Luo Tian ignored the fragment’s roar; ten-colored flames also wrapped around it, rapidly refining.

After an hour, the fragment’s cries disappeared; a wisp of gray mist floated on Luo Tian’s hand, radiating an astonishing aura—this was the fragment’s soul force.

Luo Tian stepped onto the altar, his heart trembling; merely this aura’s overwhelming power made his hands shake. This figure was too formidable, a primordial emperor who had dominated the nine heavens.

“Merge the soul!” Luo Tian whispered, his pure soul force directed toward the bound soul.

As Luo Tian imprinted the soul onto the main soul, waves radiated from it, and a pressure spread, making Luo Tian’s hands tremble.

“Truly a master!” Luo Tian mused internally; facing this soul felt like when he was weak and faced the Epoch Master, even more so, a sense of being an ant.

As Luo Tian fused the soul force into the main soul, it seemed to vanish like a cow entering the sea; no change occurred.

“Damn!” Luo Tian cursed, his original plan was to refine this fragment and have the main soul merge it, replacing Shengfei’s soul.

But he hadn’t expected the main soul to show no reaction. However, as the fragment’s soul force was absorbed, he sensed Shengfei’s soul existed.

“Use mine!” Xue Zhu saw Luo Tian’s face, without hesitation, the blood sea vaporized; a solid gray soul appeared before him. He then pointed his finger, sending three-tenths of his soul force toward Luo Tian.

“Senior!” Luo Tian sighed, gathering the soul force and pressing it onto the main soul.

Luo Tian understood Xue Zhu’s feelings; he was also a father. If his child were in this situation, he would unhesitatingly do the same.

Three-tenths of Xue Zhu’s soul force merged, finally causing the emperor’s main soul to tremble. The gradually fused Shengfei’s soul began to show resistance.

“Is it not enough?” Xue Zhu murmured, sending another three-tenths of his soul force. Waves of gray mist emitted from the main soul, gradually forming a shadow—Shengfei’s form.

However, Shengfei’s image was extremely vague, like a wisp of smoke, as if a slight breeze would scatter it.

“Again!” Xue Zhu’s eyes showed ferocity, sending another three-tenths of his soul force. This was Xue Zhu’s limit; if he lost the last tenth, he would be gone.

“Senior, you can’t lose it!” Luo Tian shouted at Xue Zhu, watching his weakened state. He also pressed Xue Zhu’s soul force into the emperor’s soul.

Gray mist dispersed; as Xue Zhu’s soul was absorbed, more gray mist emitted. Shengfei’s image finally solidified somewhat; his eyes gradually regained vitality, gazing around.
