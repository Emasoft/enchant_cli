Luo Tian, known as Luo Qingqing, gently wiped away his tears, his eyes glistening with moisture. He recalled the girl who had always protected him in the轮回 (cycle of rebirth) visions.

"Sister, I've returned. From now on, no one will dare to bully me again. You don't need to defend me anymore!" Luo Tian smiled, addressing Luo Qingqing.

"You idiot! I'm your sister. Who dares to bully you?" Luo Qingqing's expression turned fierce as she glared at Luo Zhen and Luo Wu, her eyes brimming with coldness.

Seeing Luo Qingqing's gaze upon him, Luo Zhen and Luo Wu's mouths twitched nervously, their eyes darting away in avoidance.

"Luo Qingqing, let me introduce you. This is my friend, Xu Li Zi Yi. And this one is also my friend, Chen Zhan Biao!" Luo Tian took Luo Qingqing's hand and introduced them.

"Li Zi Yi, Zhan Biao. This is my sister! I've mentioned her to you before!" Luo Tian turned, addressing Xu Li Zi Yi and Chen Zhan Biao.

"Ah... delicious... Hello, sister!" Chen Zhan Biao didn't even glance at Luo Qingqing, responding with a brief nod before resuming his battle against the dragon meat.

Xu Li Zi Yi, however, observed Luo Qingqing with a flicker of interest. He could clearly sense the formidable power radiating from her, and a smile tugged at his lips. "Big sister, hello!"

Chapter 538: Kick Me

After Luo Tian's introduction, Luo Qingqing joined the group feasting on dragon meat. Luo Zhen and Luo Wu watched enviously, their mouths watering helplessly.

Not long after, Luo Tian, Xu Li Zi Yi, and Luo Qingqing each devoured a piece of dragon meat. The potent essence left them radiant, their faces flushed with vitality.

"Idiot, this dragon meat is really good. Let me take some home for my second grandfather to taste!" Luo Qingqing boasted, patting her belly with a satisfied grin.

Luo Tian said nothing but smiled gently, then extracted another large piece of dragon meat for Luo Qingqing to take.

Seeing Chen Zhan Biao still hungrily gnawing at the dragon meat, Luo Qingqing felt a flicker of surprise. She had only managed to eat one piece before reaching her limit, yet this burly youth had already consumed five. His relentless appetite was astonishing.

"Sister, what should we do with these two?" Luo Tian glanced at the bound Luo Zhen and Luo Wu, speaking softly.

"Hmph..." Hearing Luo Tian's question, Luo Qingqing sighed softly.

"Let them go. Though they erred, they are among the few in our lineage who understand reason. They know the family's decline isn't entirely tied to Grandfather and Uncle Nan Tian's departure," Luo Qingqing spoke calmly, observing the two.

With Luo Qingqing's word, Luo Tian had no choice but to comply. He flicked his fingers, and the Blue Crystal Jade Fire within their bodies flew out, returning to his palm.

"Go. Remember, don't provoke me again," Luo Tian sighed softly, gazing at Luo Zhen and Luo Wu.

Seeing Luo Qingqing's single word had freed them, Luo Zhen and Luo Wu wore grateful expressions. They bowed to Luo Qingqing and thanked Luo Tian before heading toward the courtyard's entrance.

At this moment, Luo Zhen and Luo Wu no longer sought revenge. Luo Tian's power had exceeded their comprehension, and they now viewed him as the hope for their lineage's revival. They believed Luo Tian was the only one capable of defeating Luo Han.

"Wait," as they stepped out, Luo Tian spoke softly.

Hearing Luo Tian's voice, the two halted mid-step, turning back with confusion toward him.

Luo Tian retrieved two pieces of dragon meat and tossed them before the two, while two jade bottles flew out simultaneously.

Luo Zhen and Luo Wu, puzzled, took the meat and bottles. Their confusion deepened.

"I noticed you two are nearing Nascent Soul Peak. Eat the dragon meat and see if it helps. If not, take the pills in these bottles. If you still can't reach Nascent Soul Peak, then you're truly useless!" Luo Tian spoke softly, explaining.

Hearing this, Luo Zhen and Luo Wu felt a shiver of awe. Their eyes carried complex emotions, gratitude toward Luo Tian as they bowed slightly before leaving his courtyard.

"Ah... I didn't expect it was you two, the prodigies Luo Zhen and Luo Wu!" As they stepped through the courtyard gate, a mocking voice echoed from outside. The two halted.

"Luo Xing'an!" They glared at the young man approaching Luo Tian's courtyard, their jaws clenched.

"Luo Xing'an?" Luo Qingqing furrowed her brows, stepping forward to the courtyard's entrance, standing before Luo Wu and Luo Zhen.

"Ah, Sister Qingqing is here too!" Luo Xing'an smiled as he approached the three.

"Luo Xing'an, what business do you have with our lineage?" Luo Qingqing asked, her expression unkind.

Luo Xing'an, a prodigy of the direct line with wind, water, and ice attributes, was notoriously domineering. His strength ranked second only to Luo Han, the top youth of the generation. With both Luo Han and Luo Xing'an, the direct line was arrogant and overbearing.

Luo Han often secluded himself in cultivation, leaving Luo Xing'an as the de facto leader of the younger generation. Only Luo Qingqing with her triple attribute and formidable strength could match him, though other lineage prodigies also held their ground.

However, due to the scarcity of resources in Luo Tian's lineage, Luo Qingqing's strength was merely at Nascent Soul Late Stage. In contrast, Luo Xing'an had already reached Nascent Soul Peak. Thus, even though she could fight him, victory was improbable.

"I came to find someone— the boy you once protected. I heard he's returned from death. I'm here to congratulate him!" Luo Xing'an spoke coldly toward Luo Qingqing.

At that moment, Luo Tian and Xu Li Zi Yi stepped out of the courtyard. Upon seeing Luo Xing'an, Luo Tian's eyes flashed with intensity.

Luo Xingan glanced past Luo Qingqing and looked into the courtyard. When he saw the hundred-zhang-long water dragon, his eyes narrowed, then flashed with intense excitement.

"An Abyssal Soul Peak water dragon! I've never seen one before!" Luo Xing'an gazed greedily at the severed-tail water dragon.

He knew well that the dragon's body was a treasure. Its flesh could be refined for cultivation, and its scales and horns could forge remarkable treasures.

"Excellent. If I refine this dragon's essence, I might reach Abyssal Soul Stage!" Luo Xing'an nodded absentmindedly, ignoring Luo Tian and Xu Li Zi Yi as he stared at the dragon.

"You're looking for me?" Luo Tian stepped out of the courtyard, addressing Luo Xing'an with a question.

Seemingly interrupted from his thoughts, Luo Xing'an's expression darkened as he watched Luo Tian emerge.

"You're Luo Tian. I didn't expect the one who died would truly return. That Yin Tianxiong really has some skill! Do you remember me? I kicked you once before. You didn't forget, did you?" Luo Xing'an sneered at Luo Tian.

"Qingqing, repeat that!" Luo Qingqing's aura suddenly coalesced as she stared coldly at Luo Xing'an.

"Ah, I forgot, Qingqing. If not for your timely arrival, this boy wouldn't have survived past ten!" Luo Xing'an ignored Luo Qingqing's icy expression and continued.

"If you've returned to the Luo family, you should obey its rules. That water dragon in your courtyard must be handed over to the clan. If you have complaints, take them to the main lineage!" Luo Xing'an spoke, pushing aside Luo Zhen and Luo Wu. His eyes gleamed as he approached the dragon.

Chapter 539: No One Here

Seeing Luo Xing'an's disregard, Luo Zhen and Luo Wu's faces flushed with anger. They roared, "Luo Xing'an, don't push too far!"

Their voices echoed as they leapt toward Luo Xing'an, blocking his path with eyes burning with hatred.

Both were Nascent Soul Late Stage masters. Though their attributes lagged, their cultivation speed was no slower than these so-called prodigies.

In recent years, Luo Xing'an had often bullied Luo Zhen's lineage. They were among the victims. As leaders of their lineage, they had endured countless humiliations from Luo Xing'an.

That was why Luo Zhen and Luo Wu despised him deeply. Yet their strength gap left them trampled by him.

"Get lost... You're no better than servants! How dare you block my path!" Luo Xing'an sneered, his hand striking out. Three attributes flared as Nascent Soul Peak power coalesced toward their faces.

"Luo Xing'an, don't overstep!" Luo Qingqing stepped in front of them, her gaze cold as she struck out with a palm, deflecting Luo Xing'an's attack.

"Boom..." Their palms collided. An invisible wave radiated outward, shaking the surroundings.

Luo Qingqing took a step back, her face grim. Though their cultivation levels were similar, the gap in realm was immense—Nascent Soul Peak versus Nascent Soul Late Stage. Though it seemed a small difference, it was like heaven and earth.

"You lineage truly has no one left! Qingqing, consider marrying me. Leave this lineage and with my resources, you'll surely reach Abyssal Soul Stage. Why stay in a dying clan?" Luo Xing'an smiled, speaking lightly.

"Son of a bitch!" Luo Zhen and Luo Wu growled, wanting to fight Luo Xing'an. His words deeply wounded them.

Luo Qingqing was their only hope for revival. Luo Xing'an's reputation on Ice Pole Island was well-known—this man had ten wives. His words were a direct insult to Luo Qingqing.

"Disobedient, you two? And that old failure now hides behind Qingqing's back too? I never thought you'd still be so useless!" Luo Xing'an sneered at Luo Tian.

"Xing'an, you're seeking death!" Luo Qingqing's face turned icy. A cold killing intent radiated from her as a pale blue sword, like frozen in time, appeared in her hand.

"Freezing Water Sword!" Seeing Luo Qingqing draw a weapon, Luo Xing'an's face finally showed concern. He took two steps back and drew his spear.

"Death..." Luo Qingqing's eyes flashed with coldness, becoming a storm of icy slaughter as she rushed toward Luo Xing'an.

Luo Xing'an wielded his spear, eyes unkind as he charged toward Luo Qingqing.

But just before their collision, Luo Tian's figure appeared like a phantom in front of Luo Xing'an. He seized the spear, which turned into a blue streak of light.

"Crunch..." A grating sound echoed from Luo Tian's hand. The spear, after landing in his grasp, lunged forward before stopping.

"Tell me, where did you kick me?" Luo Tian's voice carried a smile but his eyes flashed with coldness as he gazed at Luo Xing'an.

Luo Qingqing stood motionless, her expression stunned as she looked at Luo Tian. She had once faced Luo Xing'an's spear and knew it was beyond one hand to withstand.

Even Luo Xing'an was stunned, momentarily speechless. Then seeing Luo Tian before him, his face showed shock. He tried to wrest the spear from Luo Tian's grip but found it immovable, as if a snake's vital point had been pinched. The regional-grade weapon emitted a faint hum.

"Did you not hear me?" Luo Tian called out again, seeing Luo Xing'an's daze.

"Damn it!" Luo Xing'an finally reacted. His three attributes' energy surged, and he twisted the spear with a gritted jaw, as if using all his strength to pull it free. But soon he was disappointed—no matter how hard he struggled, the spear would not budge.

"Get out..." Luo Xing'an finally couldn't bear it and kicked. But he only kicked an afterimage of Luo Tian, who was now smiling beside Luo Qingqing.

"Sister, be gentle. Otherwise you'll never find a husband. Girls shouldn't always fight. Let your brother handle these pests!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze filled with disdain toward Luo Xing'an.

"Strong. So strong! Even Luo Xing'an couldn't escape his grip. We lost fairly!" Luo Wu spoke, looking at the disgruntled Luo Xing'an with admiration.

"Kid, I never thought you'd change so much after coming back!" Luo Xing'an inwardly marveled, already considering retreat.

The clan had sent Luo Xing'an to test Luo Tian. He hadn't expected to hit a wall. From their fight, he felt he was no match for Luo Tian. That alone would make his report difficult.

Luo Qingqing's face softened, her eyes moist as she watched Luo Tian's invincible display. She hadn't expected Luo Tian had grown from the little boy she once protected into a strong man.

"Boom..." As people pondered, a thunderous sound erupted from the courtyard. Luo Tian and others turned toward Chen Zhan Biao.

At this moment, Chen Zhan Biao's belly was swollen, his face flushed. His eyes were closed with a satisfied expression. Around him lay scattered weapons of the玄 grade (Sword Grade).

"Damn, he ate it all!" Luo Zhen and Luo Wu's faces showed intense shock as they stared at the weapons that had once held dragon meat, their eyes nearly popping out.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, concern in his gaze toward Chen Zhan Biao. He glanced at Xu Li Zi Yi and saw the latter's face light up with joy, calming Luo Tian slightly.

Chapter 540: Grew Taller

The thunderous sound continued within Chen Zhan Biao's body, causing the group to frown.

Under their curious gazes, Chen Zhan Biao's massive body suddenly surged upward three times. His colossal frame expanded by a third, his muscles swelling as if about to burst through his skin.

"Ah..." Chen Zhan Biao let out a long belch, satisfaction on his face. He looked at his body and grunted, "Ah... I've grown taller again..."

"Smack!" Xu Li Zi Yi appeared before Chen Zhan Biao, slapping him with a furious expression. "Eat your fill and go work! Go fight, that kid is bullying your Luo Tian大哥. Beat him!"

"Fight!" Chen Zhan Biao's eyes flashed with intensity, looking at Luo Xing'an pointed out by Xu Li Zi Yi.

"Looks tough! I'm going!" Chen Zhan Biao laughed, his voice shaking everyone's ears. His massive body rushed toward the stunned Luo Xing'an.

"His speed is faster than before!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. This was his first time witnessing such a situation—advancing through eating.

"Damn, is this the same big guy who almost beat us?" Luo Zhen and Luo Wu's mouths twitched, their faces filled with disbelief as they looked at Chen Zhan Biao.

They remembered that when they fought him, he was always complaining of hunger. Now, among these people, they clearly felt the weakest.

While the group marveled, Chen Zhan Biao and Luo Xing'an clashed. Chen Zhan Biao's specialty was hand-to-hand combat, but Luo Xing'an didn't know this. His martial arts were useless against Chen Zhan Biao, and the result was predictable.

Within less than an hour, Luo Xing'an was defenseless. He felt he wasn't fighting a person but a regular person against an elephant.

"Terrific body!" Luo Tian and others marveled, gazing at Chen Zhan Biao.

At this moment, Chen Zhan Biao embodied the term "fierce" to its peak. Every part of his body seemed like a weapon, constantly attacking Luo Xing'an.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." The thunderous sounds echoed from their front, powerful waves shaking Luo Tian's courtyard.

"Invincible body!" Even with his confidence in his own formidable physique, Luo Tian couldn't help but admire Chen Zhan Biao's terrifying body.

"Idiot!" Xu Li Zi Yi saw Luo Xing'an choosing to endure instead of using martial arts, his face showing a sneer.

If Luo Xing'an knew Xu Li Zi Yi's thoughts, he'd curse: "I want to use martial arts! But I need time to prepare!"

Luo Xing'an had never encountered such an opponent. Despite having no energy, he was terrifyingly strong. He felt as if pulled by some force—anywhere within a zhang of Chen Zhan Biao, he couldn't escape his attacks. Any slight opening would be met with a storm of attacks.

"Boom..." Luo Xing'an endured for an hour before finally giving in, being kicked in the chest and flying backward.

Chen Zhan Biao then dragged Luo Xing'an, expertly throwing him at Luo Tian and Xu Li Zi Yi's feet.

"That was too fierce!" Luo Zhen and Luo Wu's faces showed intense shock. They hadn't expected the formidable Luo Xing'an to be defeated by Chen Zhan Biao.

"Hey, do you two want another fight? I was hungry before, so it doesn't count. Let's start over!" Chen Zhan Biao smiled at Luo Zhen and Luo Wu.

"No, no!" Luo Zhen and Luo Wu's mouths twitched as they declined. Their faces were pale, fearing Chen Zhan Biao would target them.

"What about him?" Luo Tian's hand flicked out a thread of Blue Crystal Jade Fire, entering Luo Xing'an's dantian. He asked Luo Qingqing.

"Luo Tian, I am a direct lineage member of the Luo family. You dare to touch me!" Luo Xing'an's face twisted with menace, gazing at Luo Tian.

"You two must be very angry with him. Now that he can't use his strength, won't you avenge?" Luo Tian seemed not to hear Luo Xing'an's threat. His eyes smiled as he looked at Luo Zhen and Luo Wu.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, the two shuddered. Their mouths curled into a cruel arc as they approached Luo Xing'an.

"Go, sister. Tell me about this lineage's situation so I can prepare. After all, they've come to our door. Not retaliating isn't my style!" Luo Tian took Luo Qingqing's hand and walked into the courtyard, ignoring Luo Zhen and Luo Wu.

Luo Qingqing looked at Luo Tian with admiration. She hadn't expected not only his strength but also his friends' abilities.

Seeing Luo Qingqing's gaze sweep over himself and Chen Zhan Biao, Xu Li Zi Yi straightened his posture, flashing a self-perceived charming smile. But Luo Tian and Luo Qingqing seemed to ignore it, discussing the Luo family's current state.

With Luo Qingqing's account, Luo Tian roughly understood their lineage's situation. He had already prepared for the worst but was now frowning slightly.

"Our lineage is much worse than I imagined!" Luo Tian frowned slightly.

Luo Tian hadn't expected their lineage had declined so much. The entire Ice Pole Island's Luo family was divided into ten lines. Now, the dominant one was Luo Xing'an's grandfather, Luotai's lineage. The remaining lines were subordinate, including Luo Tian's.

However, the leaders of other lines were Soul Severance Stage masters. Only Luo Zhen was Nascent Soul Peak, making their position at the bottom inevitable. Now their lineage's strength was equivalent to Xuanbing City, no match for other lines.

"My grandfather also relied on a special method—what your grandfather left behind when he left home. It allowed him to briefly enter the Soul Severance Stage, keeping us in Ice Pole Island. Otherwise, our lineage might have been expelled from Ice Pole Island!" Luo Qingqing's face showed bitterness as she spoke.

"The only hope is my second grandfather!" Luo Tian sighed, speaking.

"Indeed. Grandfather has been stuck at Nascent Soul Peak for nearly thirty years. His talent should have allowed him to enter the Soul Severance Stage. But these years, family matters fell on his shoulders alone, making him anxious. Resources were all given to us, so he never advanced!" Luo Qingqing spoke, her eyes showing concern.

"Since I've returned, this matter is mine!" Luo Tian smiled and handed Luo Qingqing a storage bag.

"Take this, sister. Use the pills for those in need, like those outside. As for the water dragon, I'll take half away later to give to those in need, boosting our lineage's overall strength. Also, I'll think of ways to find a method for Grandfather to advance to the Soul Severance Stage. Unless it's very important, don't bother me!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze deep.

Hearing this, Luo Qingqing had no doubt. Instinctively trusting him, she nodded slightly: "Also, next month is the family competition. The family competition determines rankings, and based on these rankings, we determine superiority. We were completely beaten to last place in the last family competition!"

"Next month? Time should be enough. Sister, please take care of my two friends during this time!" Luo Tian nodded slightly, addressing Luo Qingqing.

"Leave it to me. Since they're your friends, I'll take care of them!"

Luo Qingqing's face showed a rare soft smile as she addressed Xu Li Zi Yi and Chen Zhan Biao.

Luo Tian also prepared more cooked dragon meat for Luo Qingqing to take, watching her and the now-exhausted Luo Zhen and Luo Wu leave.

The remaining dragon meat was given to Xu Li Zi Yi. After all, Chen Zhan Biao was always hungry. This dragon meat was much better than food; just a little would satisfy him.

As for Luo Xing'an, he was left under Xu Li Zi Yi and Chen Zhan Biao's watch. Luo Tian ignored him, sitting alone in the courtyard with a contemplative expression.

"Nine Heavens Xuan Ming Dan!" After some thinking, Luo Tian whispered.

The Nine Heavens Xuan Ming Dan was a seven-grade elixir, increasing the chance of advancing from Nascent Soul Peak to Soul Severance Stage. It was a miraculous elixir, drawing on the power of heaven and earth, integrating it into the elixir. After consuming it, one could communicate with heaven and earth to advance to Soul Severance.

"Seven-grade elixir. For me now, it should be difficult," Luo Tian sighed with a smile but soon his gaze focused. His hands moved, and herbs flowed from them into the Zhen Hun Cauldron.

"Big brother, is Luo Tian about to perform magic again?" Chen Zhan Biao looked at Luo Tian's thousand-page elixir technique, his face showing confusion.

"Smack... Stupid kid. Your big brother is refining elixirs. Remember not to disturb him..." Xu Li Zi Yi showed admiration, surprised that Luo Tian was also an elixir refiner, and apparently a high-level one.

Under Xu Li Zi Yi and Chen Zhan Biao's watch, Luo Xing'an's face showed a grim expression. Seeing the focused Luo Tian refining elixirs, he felt their lineage was in danger.

Seven days passed quickly.

During these seven days, Luo Tian's courtyard echoed with thunderous sounds. There were even two instances of elixir trials, surprising the people of Ice Pole Island. However, no one paid much attention; thunderstorms were common in Ice Pole Island since many often advanced to Nascent Soul Stage. Unless it was five or more thunderstorms, no one would care.

Another event distracted people's attention: the family competition was nearly half a month away. With such an important contest, members of each lineage couldn't help but take it seriously.

Luo Tian opened his eyes. His gaze flashed with intensity as he whispered, "Now that I can refine six-grade elixirs without effort, let me try refining a seven-grade one. Though I have no confidence, I must take the risk!"

After a brief rest, Luo Tian's face turned serious again. He gazed at the Zhen Hun Cauldron and moved his hands, throwing herbs into it one by one.

The Blue Crystal Jade Fire surged skyward, entering the Zhen Hun Cauldron. Herbs transformed into medicinal liquid under the terrifying heat, isolated by Luo Tian's powerful spiritual awareness.

"Three hundred and fifty herbs have been refined into medicinal liquid. Now it's time to condense the elixir!" Luo Tian's face showed a slight tension as his powerful spiritual awareness wrapped around three hundred and fifty drops of liquid, slowly condensing.

"Buzz..." As the elixir condensed, a rumbling sound echoed from the Zhen Hun Cauldong. Clouds gathered in the sky.

Xu Li Zi Yi and Chen Zhan Biao watched the gathering clouds, already accustomed to this. These past few days, Luo Tian had condensed three elixir trials.

But Xu Li Zi Yi knew this time's elixir was different. The previous ones were six-grade, but today Luo Tian refined a seven-grade one.

Though the difference was just one grade, it was like heaven and earth. Once an elixir passed seven-grade, no one would help it through the thunderstorm; it had to endure it itself. If successful, it became a seven-grade elixir. If failed or helped through, the elixir would either vanish or drop to six-grade.

Luo Tian's face was tense as he condensed the final drop of medicinal liquid onto the elixir. Under the Blue Crystal Jade Fire's refinement, a dark black elixir slowly formed within his spiritual awareness.

"Come here!" Luo Tian waved his hand, and surrounding energy rushed toward the Zhen Hun Cauldron. He fused it into the elixir.

One hour... two hours...

The clouds in the sky accumulated more and more, thunderous sounds echoing within them. Xu Li Zi Yi and Chen Zhan Biao watched with excitement.

If Luo Tian succeeded, it would mean he had advanced to a seven-grade elixir refiner. A seven-grade elixir refiner was the peak in Tianyuan Continent, and one's elixir skills alone would make them sought after by major sects.

Happy New Year, ten chapters delivered. Today is the last day of ten chapters. I'm exhausted and can't push further; please forgive me. Starting tomorrow, without the editor's requirement to save drafts, I'll write as much as I can. Thank you for your support!

Chapter 541: Shocking the Luo Family

Under Xu Li Zi Yi's expectant gaze, Luo Tian slammed his hands on the Zhen Hun Cauldron. A pearl-like elixir flew out of it.

At that moment, the entire world's energy converged toward the elixir. A massive energy vortex surged skyward, merging into the elixir as if it were a breakthrough. Its commotion was no less than that of a human's cultivation advancement.

"Boom... Boom..." The familiar thunder sound echoed. The clouds in the sky, sensing the elixir's presence, roared.

"Miraculous!" Xu Li Zi Yi inwardly marveled. He watched the elixir in the sky, whispering with concern about whether it could withstand the thunderstorm.

"Condensed elixir!" Luo Tian roared, his hand flicking out a drop of blood. Like an arrow, it landed on the elixir.

"Boom... Boom..." When Luo Tian's blood merged with the elixir, lightning in the sky felt it and could no longer control itself. A water-bucket thick dragon of lightning roared down, aiming to destroy this elixir that seemed to defy heaven and earth.

After absorbing Luo Tian's blood, the elixir glowed with a dark light. A powerful aura surged skyward, confronting the approaching thunderstorm.

Under Luo Tian and Xu Li Zi Yi's expectant gaze, the dark elixir finally touched the thunderstorm.

"Crack..." As the thunderstorm just touched the elixir, fine cracks formed on it. The previously dark and glossy elixir's light dimmed considerably.

"Failed!" Luo Tian's eyes showed disappointment as he gazed at the growing cracks on the Nine Heavens Xuan Ming Dan, whispering.

Xu Li Zi Yi sighed in regret. His gaze met Luo Tian's disappointment and he fell silent.

"So difficult! At such a young age, already a six-grade elixir refiner. This achievement is admirable. But seven-grade elixir refiner... for Luo Tian now, it's too hard!" Xu Li Zi Yi inwardly sighed.

"Boom..." As the two were disappointed, the Nine Heavens Xuan Ming Dan could no longer withstand the thunderstorm's pressure. It exploded with a loud bang, turning into powder that vanished into the world.

The thunderclouds dispersed. Sunlight returned, shining on Luo Tian's pale face. The elixir's destruction caused his spiritual awareness to dissipate, giving him a significant backlash.

"Expected. I was still lacking! Again!" Luo Tian's face showed a struggle. After recovering slightly, his eyes flashed with determination. He slammed his hand on the Zhen Hun Cauldron again.

...

Seven days passed in a blink. Luo Tian's courtyard echoed with thunderous sounds, and the sky's clouds never seemed to dissipate. Thunderstorms fell every few hours into Luo Tian's courtyard.

"Which people of the Luo Zhan lineage are undergoing thunderstorms? Why do these thunderstorms show no signs of dissipating? Did the Luo Zhan lineage all enter Nascent Soul Stage?" People on Ice Pole Island marveled.

Luo Tai sat in the hall, his gaze dark as he looked at the sky above the Luo Zhan lineage. He muttered, "This isn't someone undergoing thunderstorms but someone refining elixirs—refining seven-grade or higher elixirs!"

The entire Luo Zhan lineage felt it most clearly. Everyone knew Luo Tian was refining an elixir. When people learned that Luo Tian was refining a seven-grade elixir, some mocked his overconfidence while others looked with anticipation, hoping he would succeed.

After all, a seven-grade elixir refiner was as important to a clan as a Soul Severance Stage master.

Even the elders in Ice Pole Island's back mountains were disturbed by Luo Tian's commotion. Upon sensing it was a junior refining elixirs, they closed their eyes again.

Seven days passed. Luo Tian refined elixirs day and night like a madman, refusing to see anyone. Xu Li Zi Yi and Chen Zhan Biao blocked all visitors. Luo Zhen ordered no one to disturb Luo Tian, waiting for him to emerge.

"Roar..." At this moment, Luo Tian's face showed excitement. Though he hadn't succeeded in seven days of high-intensity elixir refining, his spiritual awareness had broken through after a moment's pause. He had advanced to the Soul Severance Stage's spiritual awareness, i.e., Converging Yuan Stage.

Advancing to the Converging Yuan Stage, Luo Tian felt his soul had ascended. His spiritual awareness was unusually strong but seemed to have a splitting tendency. He knew this was the normal reaction of spiritual awareness entering the Soul Severance Stage—seven souls would split.

After closing his eyes for a while, Luo Tian opened them. His gaze flashed with intensity as he muttered, "Previously, my spiritual awareness was insufficient and the elixir wasn't solid enough. That's why it failed in the thunderstorm. Now my spiritual awareness has advanced to Converging Yuan, and my chances of success have doubled!"

Luo Tian's eyes showed excitement. After adjusting his mindset, he calmed down and the Blue Crystal Jade Fire surged out. He slammed it onto the Zhen Hun Cauldron's fire mouth.

Refining medicinal liquid, he completed this step in a moment. His face showed joy before entering the condensation process.
