The collision arrived in an instant, and countless disciples of the Lunzhuan Sect and those dry corpses perished beneath it. This time, however, the disciples of the Lunzhuan Sect suffered heavy casualties once more.

"Can't fight!" Mo Cheng and his companions instantly realized. Although the Grand Formation of the Lunzhuan Sect was formidable, after the ghost soldiers and dry corpses merged into one entity, their strength had surged to an entirely new level.

It was like a five or six-year-old child wielding a knife against a strong adult—such was the crushing superiority of their power, beyond what weapons could overcome.

"Divine Burial!" Yang Huanyu ignored the other collisions, ten ghost soldiers standing around him. They carried a massive black coffin and pressed down upon Luo Tian.

"Looks like I must use all my strength!" Luo Tian observed the black coffin carried by the ghost soldiers, his face darkened with concern. Without hesitation, he drew his Dragon Abyss Sword, and a torrent of sinister energy surged forth.

"Seven凶 Swords, Dragon Abyss!"

"This is intriguing!" Upon seeing Luo Tian's black sword, Yang Huanyu's eyes flickered with interest.

"Ah?" However, as Luo Tian just drew the Dragon Abyss Sword, his heart clenched violently. A gush of blood erupted from his mouth, and he trembled uncontrollably.

Chapter 2161: Unmasking the Truth

Luo Tian's face was pale, his spirit trembling violently as if grasped by an invisible hand and torn from his body.

"Damn it, what's happening?" Luo Tian's face was as pale as paper, his body shaking uncontrollably. He gazed at the ten ghost soldiers carrying the black coffin that descended upon him.

Luo Tian wished to resist, but the overwhelming冲击 left him unable to even grip his Dragon Abyss Sword.

"Boom..." Luo Tian spat blood, his eyes went dark, and he was crushed beneath the black coffin.

"Ah?" Yang Huanyu's eyes flickered with surprise. He gazed at the descending black coffin, sensing Luo Tian vanish beneath it.

Endless darkness enveloped Luo Tian, as if he were a lone soul lost in the infinite stars. He did not know where he was.

"What's happening? Why is this so sudden? What should I do?" Luo Tian had not lost consciousness, but he did not know where to go.

Amidst the vast expanse of stars, Luo Tian sought his physical body but found no direction.

"Panicked!" Luo Tian was truly panicked. He had never experienced such a situation before—his spirit separated from his body, and he did not know where it was.

Yet, Luo Tian seemed to be flying in another form. He flew for an unknown duration until a familiar sensation emerged within his perception.

It was a vast nebula, containing countless stars and continents. The atmosphere here felt deeply familiar to Luo Tian.

"Nine Realms!" Luo Tian's heart surged with excitement. He observed the Nine Realms in another form, his vast spiritual awareness encompassing the entire realm. Every detail within the Nine Realms became visible to him.

"Father, Mother!" Luo Tian instantly focused his attention on the Tianyuan Continent, where he saw his parents, Luo Nantian.

"Zheng Xin, Xu Liyi, Jiang Nanxuan..." Each familiar figure appeared within Luo Tian's perception, filling him with excitement.

"They're all still alive, but they've aged so much," Luo Tian murmured to himself. Though he did not know why he found himself in this state, he was grateful to see his parents. Even if he were about to die, seeing the Nine Realms in good condition was a comfort.

"Ah?" However, Luo Tian's gaze fell upon the nearby nebula. A sense of foreboding arose within him.

Another nebula, significantly larger than the Nine Realms, slowly moved toward it. Though its pace was slow, collision with the Nine Realms was inevitable.

Two small worlds were about to collide! Luo Tian instantly thought of a possibility, his heart sinking. If the two nebulae collided, the Nine Realms would suffer greatly. His descendants and loved ones would inevitably be harmed.

"What should I do?" Luo Tian envisioned the world collapsing, an apocalyptic scenario. The Nine Realms might be destroyed or at least severely damaged.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian anxiously pondered, waves of energy struck him. A series of calls echoed within his ears.

"Ah..."

"A million years... a great calamity will come upon the Nine Realms!" Luo Tian roared, his entire being now completely frenzied.

"Ah?" At the same time, everyone in the Nine Realms trembled. Their hearts clenched violently.

"Little Tian!" Luo Nantian and his wife's bodies shook violently, their eyes filled with disbelief. Their minds had indeed heard a voice.

"Did you hear it too?" The two of them spoke simultaneously, their voices trembling with shock.

"Uncle!" As they exchanged glances, a series of mental transmissions echoed within their minds.

In the Nine Realms, whether it was the Sacred Clan or the Ancient Kings, they all heard Luo Tian's call.

However, some who heard it did not take it seriously, as they had never heard Luo Tian's voice before and only knew of the Reincarnation Lord. But those who had heard his voice were all stunned, their eyes filled with disbelief.

"He... has returned?" Those who knew of Luo Tian had become elders. The entire Nine Realms trembled due to his call, and many elders of the Sacred Clans rushed toward the Tianyuan Continent, seeking truth. It was because Luo Tian's call had been so sudden.

In the Tianyuan Continent, many people appeared—nearly all were elders. They gathered at the center of the Five Elements Sect, where a statue stood. The statue's form was none other than Luo Tian.

"It must be Luo Tian, for almost everyone in the Nine Realms heard it. There's no mistake! Who else in the entire Nine Realms could have such power!"

"Did Luo Tian not become an immortal? How did he manage to transmit this call to so many people at once?"

"What was that great calamity he spoke of?!" People thought back to Luo Tian's mention of the great calamity and believed it without doubt.

"It's possible that his current strength has reached the heavens. Perhaps when he became the Lord of the Epoch, he foresaw a calamity in the Nine Realms and used this special method to warn us!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, his voice filled with admiration.

"I choose to believe that boy. His voice was extremely urgent; it wasn't just a regular calamity. We must prepare early!" An elder spoke, the former master of the Five Elements Sect, Wei Mingxuan.

"Enhance our strength. Luo Tian ascended only a million years ago; becoming the Lord of the Epoch is impossible. We can only create more semi-epoch lords!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly.

"Luochen!" A thunderous voice echoed within Luo Tian's mind, as if he were being pulled away.

His senses gradually returned. He opened his eyes, blood trickled from his mouth, and his body was riddled with cracks. He saw figures appearing in his vision.

"This..." Luo Tian felt bewildered, gazing at the people around him. He instantly understood.

"Luochen! Do you know your crime? How dare you kill within the Reincarnation Realm, slaughtering thousands of disciples from the Lunzhuan Sect!" Luo Tian had not yet recovered when Yu Tian's ugly face appeared before him.

"What?" Upon hearing Yu Tian's words, Luo Tian understood the situation. His face darkened slightly as he wiped blood from his mouth, feeling dizzy.

"Are you alright?" Du Jianhang appeared beside Luo Tian, supporting him as he was weak.

"Previously in the Reincarnation Pool, over two thousand disciples died. They suspected you of it and had the sect master personally pull you out from the Reincarnation Pool!"

"Don't admit it. Even if those people were killed by you, don't confess. Without evidence, they won't do anything to you!" Du Jianhang directly transmitted mentally.

"Ah, I see now!" Luo Tian's heart turned cold. He had been desperately reducing the deaths of the Lunzhuan Sect disciples within the Reincarnation Realm, yet these people had forcibly pulled him out of the pool.

Luo Tian naturally knew the danger of being pulled from the Reincarnation Pool. He had already vaguely guessed that it was only because Fu Xingxuan's constant calls that he could return.

"Confess your crime? What crime do I have?" Luo Tian let out a soft laugh, gazing at Yu Tian.

"Why did you massacre the disciples of the Lunzhuan Sect within the Reincarnation Realm?" Yu Tian's face bore a smile as he asked.

"I massacred the disciples of the Lunzhuan Sect?"

"Did all the deputy sect masters also think so?" Luo Tian's gaze swept over each deputy master, wiping blood from his mouth.

"I organized the disciples of the Lunzhuan Sect to fight back against those who entered the Reincarnation Realm and slaughtered our disciples!"

"Because of your so-called suspicions, you forcibly pulled me out from the Reincarnation Pool. Is that fair?" Luo Tian's voice carried disappointment. This was not directed at Yu Tian but at the Yell and Silence.

"Indeed, it wasn't him!" The Yell and Silence sat in the hall, their expressions slightly stiff.

"This time I misjudged you. Naturally, I will give you an explanation!" The Yell and Silence's voice echoed within Luo Tian's mind. After all, he was the sect master; if he apologized in front of all the disciples of the Lunzhuan Sect, it would be a loss of dignity.

"It wasn't him. Why did disciples keep dying in the Reincarnation Pool while he was inside? Once he came out, no more disciples died!" Yu Tian shouted, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Yu Tian, what are you?"

"You think I fear you? You've tried to kill me several times. Now you're falsely accusing me. What's your intention? You know well!" Luo Tian roared.

"Yu Tian, my disciples have already spoken clearly. Why don't you quickly fulfill the previous agreement and make your disciples kneel to apologize!" Du Jianhang shouted.

"What evidence do you have that it wasn't him? With just your word, he came out and no one died. How do you explain that?" Yu Tian naturally would not back down easily.

"Yu Tian, stop talking nonsense. Let's settle this with a duel on the Reincarnation Platform! Are you brave enough?" As people murmured, Luo Tian's cold voice echoed in their ears, causing a slight pause.

"Luo Chen, don't be reckless!" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Du Jianhang's face changed.

"Haha..." A series of wild laughs echoed. Yu Tian and the other celestial kings' deputy masters smiled, while the disciples of the Lunzhuan Sect also sneered.

"Truly a young bull that doesn't fear the tiger. You think your strength in late Celestial King is enough to challenge my authority?" Yu Tian's face bore contempt as he gazed at Luo Tian. Even if Luo Tian had reached late Celestial King, Yu Tian was confident he could crush him with a single finger.

Chapter 2162: The Final Move

Frustration. Luo Tian was extremely frustrated now. He did not know whether the feeling he had just experienced in the Nine Realms was real or an illusion. But a bad premonition always arose within him, especially when he saw Yu Tian's repulsive face. He just wanted to slap his face hard.

However, everyone looked at Luo Tian with sneers, thinking he had gone mad. Otherwise, why would he say such a foolish question?

Only one person in the entire Lunzhuan Sect remained silent—Fu Xingxuan. She knew Luo Tian's words must have had a certain level of confidence, and it was quite high.

"Answer me—do you dare or not!" Luo Tian's face remained cold, his gaze locked onto Yu Tian. His eyes brimmed with killing intent.

"Kid, you're seeking your own death, do you know that?"

"For how many years has anyone dared to challenge the authority of a Celestial King!" Yu Tian let out a soft laugh.

"Yu Tian! The promise you made earlier must be fulfilled!" As Yu Tian was somewhat pleased, Du Jianhang's aged voice echoed in his ears. Yu Tian's face slightly changed.

"Buzz..." A series of sword energies suddenly appeared behind Yu Tian. The area within ten thousand feet became a world of swords. Du Jianhang stood behind Yu Tian, his palm striking out like a sword, slicing toward Yu Tian.

Yu Tian's face immediately darkened. He hadn't expected Du Jianhang to act, but it was because Du Jianhang was so angry. Among the four Celestial Kings at mid-level, Du Jianhang had the most temperate character. That was why Yu Tian dared to be so bold.

"Buzz..." The sword energy was countless, leaving no space for Yu Tian to escape.

"Damn it!" Yu Tian cursed under his breath. His hands moved rapidly, and black flames instantly enveloped him, forming a flame barrier.

Plop plop plop...

Yet still, many sword energies pierced through the flames and struck Yu Tian's body, leaving him in a terrible state.

"Yu Tian, do you think I won't touch you?" Du Jianhang stood within the sword domain, taking one step closer to Yu Tian.

"Master Du, don't be reckless. Let's talk it out!" The other deputy masters' faces immediately changed, urging Du Jianhang to stop.

"Whoever blocks me will not live!" Du Jianhang coldly glanced at the deputy masters, causing their expressions to freeze. In Du Jianhang's eyes, they saw his icy gaze and knew he was truly angry.

"Master, today I'll teach you how to use the sword!" Du Jianhang extended his hand. The Dragon Abyss Sword on Luo Tian's back vanished from its sheath and appeared in Du Jianhang's hand. The dark sword radiated a cold aura.

If Luo Tian had drawn the Dragon Abyss Sword, it would have released an overwhelming sinister energy. But in Du Jianhang's hands, the sword had become a docile child, only releasing powerful authority.

"Master Du, don't be angry. I was just joking!" Yu Tian smiled nervously, his body bearing several wounds and retreating to escape Du Jianhang's domain.

"Buzz..." But what he received was Du Jianhang raising his hand and striking a sword. The black energy slashed through the sky, causing wind and clouds to twist.

"Pu..." Blood erupted from Yu Tian's body. A deep wound appeared on his form.

"Did you see that?" Du Jianhang spoke to Luo Tian, who stood there thoughtfully.

"I saw a little!" Luo Tian's eyes flickered with contemplation. He gazed at Du Jianhang, sensing a faint understanding but not knowing where to start.

"Master, I've understood the five realms of sword art!"

"The one just now was the second realm—sword is sword, man is man. When a person loses, the sword does not!"

"The third realm is no self, no sword!"

"The fourth realm is this sword domain!"

"The fifth realm I've understood—everything in the world can be a sword!" Du Jianhang continued speaking, his Dragon Abyss Sword radiating overwhelming power. He slashed four times with it!

Each of the four sword energies contained profound truths, an意境 of absolute control over the sword.

Blood splattered constantly as four deep wounds appeared on Yu Tian's body, each strike leaving him severely wounded.

"Did you see that now?" Du Jianhang gazed at Luo Tian. The entire Lunzhuan Sect's sky was unusually quiet, everyone's faces filled with shock.

Some had a sudden realization, while others were stunned by Du Jianhang's overwhelming strength. Yu Tian had no power to resist at all in Du Jianhang's hands.

"I saw it, but I can't use it!" Luo Tian shook his head gently. He knew that to reach Du Jianhang's level, he needed time—long and long.

At this level, if Du Jianhang wished, anything could be used as a sword. To learn Du Jianhang's sword techniques, Luo Tian first needed to master the five realms of sword art. Otherwise, he would only learn the surface.

Like "One Sword to Heaven," although it was powerful, Luo Tian was certain that if Du Jianhang mastered it, its power would surpass his by countless times. Not because of strength but due to understanding of the sword.

"Congratulations, Master Du! You've understood the fifth realm!" Deputy masters' faces immediately lit up as they spoke to Du Jianhang. They had previously thought Du Jianhang only understood the sword domain, but they hadn't expected him to have reached the fifth realm.

Yu Tian stood there, gazing at Du Jianhang with a hint of fear. The sword master Du Jianhang was now the most powerful among the Celestial Kings.

"Yu Tian, dare you step onto the platform for a duel!" As people thought this farce would end, Luo Tian's voice echoed again.

"What? Is this kid crazy? Du Jianhang has already acted on his behalf. Now he wants to fight Yu Tian for punishment?" Everyone looked at Luo Tian as if watching a madman.

"Fight! I fight!" Yu Tian roared. Today he was truly frustrated. Du Jianhang had taken the initiative, and a mere late Celestial King could dare to challenge him. Moreover, it was twice. How could Yu Tian bear it?

"Let's not go elsewhere. Let's do this here, fate decides!" Yu Tian shouted loudly. Although he had been wounded, defeating Luo Tian was just one strike away. If it failed, then two strikes.

"Chen'er, you..." Du Jianhang was also stunned. He didn't know why Luo Tian insisted on fighting Yu Tian.

Du Jianhang knew that Luo Tian was not a match for Yu Tian. That's why he had personally wounded Yu Tian to vent his anger on Luo Tian.

"I know what I'm doing!" Luo Tian's face bore respect as he spoke to Du Jianhang.

"If you say it's here, then so be it!" Luo Tian waved his hands. Strange waves emerged from his palms, causing people's eyes to flicker with confusion.

"I'll see what you're capable of. Do you think having the Seven凶 Swords Dragon Abyss makes you invincible?" Yu Tian's face bore a sneer as he gazed at Luo Tian. He wanted to make Luo Tian feel despair.

"Roar..." As the strange seal on Luo Tian's hand fell, a series of roars echoed beneath everyone. A massive sound resonated through the entire Lunzhuan Sect.

"Boom..." In an instant, a massive figure emerged from the Lunzhuan Sect. It was the Bull-Headed Ghost.

"Isn't this my ghostly creature?" An old man's face immediately showed surprise. He didn't know why his ghostly creature had left the Ghost Feeding Pavilion on its own.

"Mu..." The Bull-Headed Ghost let out a low cry, stepping into the air and appearing beside Luo Tian.

"Why aren't you obeying my commands?" The next moment, the old man's face was filled with shock.

"Sss..." Cold air echoed through the world. A black snake coiled out, its thick body forming a black lightning bolt. Eight large heads appeared before Luo Tian.

"Haha! This is your final move? A semi-Immortal Ghostly Creature? Kid, do you know who its master is? Do you think just by cleaning the Ghost Feeding Pavilion and befriending these creatures, they'll help you?"

"I thought your final move was something else. I was disappointed!" Yu Tian's face bore contempt as he spoke to the black snake.

But the black snake did not move at all. It only gazed deeply at Yu Tian before settling beside Luo Tian.

"Roar..." Roars echoed constantly. In an instant, everyone was stunned. Six more massive creatures emerged from the Lunzhuan Sect.

"Nine-Headed Bird... Eight-Armed Ape..."

"My heavens! Aren't these the ghostly creatures of the eight Celestial Kings? Why have they suddenly appeared!" Everyone's faces were filled with disbelief, watching the eight massive creatures surrounding Luo Tian.

Eight massive ghostly creatures, three of which were at the early Immortal level. Their fierce aura caused everyone to tremble.

"Damn it, why aren't they obeying my commands!" Yu Tian's face was dark with anger. He watched the eight snakes that did not move at all. The other deputy masters, including Du Jianhang, had faces filled with bitterness because they discovered that their ghostly creatures, which they had raised for years, no longer obeyed them.

"Kill him!" Luo Tian extended his hand and pointed at Yu Tian, gazing at him with mockery.

"Roar..." In an instant, the eight massive creatures roared and rushed toward Yu Tian. This included the eight snakes that Yu Tian had raised.

"Damn it!" Yu Tian cursed, and black flames immediately rose, sweeping toward the eight ghostly creatures.

"Another death!" As Yu Tian's attack had just left his hands, someone cried out again. Over a hundred disciples in the Reincarnation Pool lost their lives simultaneously.

"What's happening? They were fine just now!" Everyone's faces turned grim.

Chapter 2163: No Time

The thunderous sound continued to echo in the sky of the Lunzhuan Sect. Eight massive ghostly creatures continuously attacked Yu Tian, five at the semi-Immortal level and three at the early Immortal level. Though they were ghostly creatures, they still left Yu Tian in a terrible state, even using his domain to suppress five of the semi-Immortal level creatures.

The three early Immortal-level ghostly creatures continuously rushed toward Yu Tian. The Nine-Headed Bird opened its mouth and spat out nine long dragons, wrapping around Yu Tian's body.

"Ah..." Yu Tian roared. Just as he broke free from the nine dragons, eight thick fists suddenly descended upon him, pressing down with immense power.

On another side, a black shadow appeared above Yu Tian's head. It formed a massive mouth and devoured him.

"Boom..." Yu Tian moved his body, but he was forced to endure two fists. He spat out blood and looked weak.

Before Yu Tian could recover, the black mouth also bit into his body, nearly cutting him in half.

"Ah..." Yu Tian screamed. He had already been wounded by Du Jianhang, and now against three early Immortal-level ghostly creatures, he was no match for them.

"Old turtle! Now you still want to suppress me?" Luo Tian stood at a distance, gazing at Yu Tian with mockery.

"Luo Chen, you..." Yu Tian's heart burned with anger. If he had any space, he could kill Luo Tian. But three ghostly creatures surrounded him tightly, leaving no chance for him to strike.

Everyone was stunned, watching Luo Tian standing there. No one had expected Luo Tian to have such a move.

"Luo Chen, you're seeking death! You've taken over our ghostly creatures!" Yu Tian shouted. Immediately, the faces of several deputy masters turned grim. They gazed at Luo Tian.

Those ghostly creatures were their hard-earned creations. Now they belonged to Luo Tian, so naturally, they did not approve.

"Respected elders, I'm only temporarily using them. Once I've defeated this old man, they'll return to their original state!" Luo Tian spoke to them.

"Give me this favor!" Du Jianhang also spoke, his eyes filled with a hint of joy. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to have such ability.

Upon hearing Du Jianhang's words, the faces of several deputy masters improved. They then gazed at Yu Tian being beaten by three early Immortal-level ghostly creatures.

"Deputy Master, two hundred more disciples have died in the Reincarnation Pool. In this short time, over four hundred have died!" A semi-Immortal elder's face was filled with alarm as he gazed at the Reincarnation Pool, causing Du Jianhang and others' faces to change.

"It's not Luo Tian. There is another person!" Everyone sighed deeply in their hearts.

Previously, people had suspected it was Luo Tian who killed the disciples within the Reincarnation Pool. After they pulled Luo Tian out, no more disciples died in the pool, which further convinced them it was Luo Tian.

But who could have imagined that so soon after, the pool had another death? Clearly, both the sect master and the deputy masters' judgment was wrong.

"There's no way to do anything. Even the sect master dared not forcibly pull someone out of the Reincarnation Pool!" A deputy master spoke, his voice filled with helplessness.

"There's another way!" However, people immediately turned their gaze to Luo Tian standing there.

"Luo Chen, now you go back into the Reincarnation Pool and save the disciples of the Lunzhuan Sect. This will be a great achievement for you!" A deputy master's face showed a hint of joy as he spoke to Luo Tian.

At this moment, only Luo Tian could return to the Reincarnation Pool. And his strength was also very formidable. Perhaps he had some way to stop the person still killing others.

"Can't!" Luo Tian coldly spoke, gazing at the deputy masters with disdain. He had been pulled out and now they wanted him to go back to save people. What were these people thinking?

"Uh..." Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, they were stunned. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to defy their orders.

"I'm in a battle, and it's a life-or-death one. I truly can't complete this difficult task!" Luo Tian shook his head gently, gazing at the beaten Yu Tian.

"Is this a life-or-death battle?" People were speechless, but the faces of several sect masters slightly smiled.

"Luo Chen, we know you're upset. But now the lives of these disciples are in your hands. You should go down once more!" An elder spoke.

"I truly can't, what does it have to do with me? Please let the sect masters pull them out of the Reincarnation Pool directly! I was pulled out like that, wasn't I!" Luo Tian's face bore respect as he gazed at the sect masters. However, his words made their faces red.

"Luo Chen, speak up. What do you want to make me go down? There are eight kings' offspring there. If they all die, the losses for our sect will be severe!" The deputy masters spoke again.

"I'm currently in a life-or-death battle. My life is still in Yu Tian's hands. I truly can't do it!" Luo Tian inwardly cursed these people for having rusted brains.

"We can guarantee that Yu Tian won't harm you!" The deputy masters' faces bore embarrassment as they assured Luo Tian. They watched Yu Tian's pitiful state, but it was not Yu Tian who would harm Luo Tian. It was Luo Tian who might harm Yu Tian.

"Let's do this: we'll help you subdue Yu Tian. You hit him with two punches, just to vent your anger!" An elder's eyes lit up as he thought of a plan. They knew Luo Tian was angry.

"Right, let's do it!" Six deputy masters exchanged glances. This was a good opportunity to help Yu Tian out of his predicament. After all, Yu Tian was in such a pitiful state now, covered in blood and beaten by three ghostly creatures.

Their figures moved like lightning. A series of domains descended upon them, overwhelming pressure instantly enveloping Yu Tian and the eight ghostly creatures. Time seemed to freeze.

Three early Immortal-level masters, three early Immortal-level others—none could withstand it. Yu Tian was immediately frozen in place. One of his legs was clutched by a large hand.

Three early Immortal-level masters acted. They imprinted seals on Yu Tian's body, instantly sealing his cultivation and sending him to Luo Tian's front.

Luo Tian also gave orders to the eight ghostly creatures, no longer attacking Yu Tian. He knew that killing Yu Tian was impossible; he could only gain some benefits by causing a commotion. If he truly killed Yu Tian, the Yell and Silence would not sit idly by.

"Old man! How's it going?" Luo Tian approached Yu Tian, his eyes filled with amusement. He raised a hand and struck Yu Tian's face.

"Smack..." A clear sound echoed on Yu Tian's face. This punch was done with all his strength, causing everyone's faces to be filled with shock.

"He actually dared to hit!"

"Luo Tian's honor has another entry—slapping a deputy master's face!" People looked at him with admiration. To do this was definitely the first person in the Lunzhuan Sect.

"Luo Tian!" Yu Tian's cultivation was sealed. His eyes stared at Luo Tian as if he wanted to devour him alive.

"What's wrong?" Luo Tian struck another punch. Although he knew this punch wouldn't harm Yu Tian, it could humiliate him more than hurting him.

"I'll kill you!" Yu Tian's face was twisted with hatred. He looked like a demon, his anger boiling over. How could he bear being slapped by this kid?

"Old Yu, you've done your part for the Lunzhuan Sect. You must endure a little more. Luo Tian is still a sect heir, so you must委屈 yourself!" Several deputy masters began to persuade him, fearing he would lose his mind.

"Luo Tian, now you've vented your anger. You should go down now!" Several deputy masters gazed at Luo Tian, their hearts also filled with resentment. They had become Luo Tian's lackeys.

If it weren't for necessity, they wouldn't have done this. But the Reincarnation Pool had already killed too many people. Not to mention, if eight kings died, the anger of those eight kings would severely damage the Lunzhuan Sect.

"Hey, it's not that I don't want to go. Elders, if I go down, I'll die for sure. The person inside is enhancing his strength by devouring others' cultivation. Now, we only have a few people left here. I estimate he's already reached late Celestial King. I can't fight him!" Luo Tian looked troubled, gazing at the deputy masters.

"What else do you want?"

"Master Du, please persuade him!" The deputy masters were almost crying. For so many years, they hadn't felt this embarrassed before. They really wanted to slap Luo Tian.

"Little bastard! Go down and save people, you cursed one. I'll lend you the Mirror of Sinful Offspring and the Battle Platform! I'll give you another chance to become the master of the Mirror of Sinful Offspring!" Just as Luo Tian was thinking about maximizing his benefits, the Yell and Silence's voice echoed in his mind. Luo Tian couldn't help but shiver.

As the Yell and Silence's words ended, a streak of light descended from the sky. It landed in Luo Tian's forehead. Fu Xingxuan also waved her hand, and the Battle Platform fell before Luo Tian.

"Okay," Luo Tian sighed deeply. He knew he couldn't resist the Yell and Silence's words. They were great masters, super great masters.

"Since the deputy masters said so, I, Luo Tian, as a member of the Lunzhuan Sect, naturally must contribute to the sect. I'll do my best!" Luo Tian's face bore determination as he spoke loudly, his words nearly causing the deputy masters to cry.

"What else are you talking about? If you don't go down, people will die!" The Yell and Silence's furious voice echoed. Luo Tian didn't even think, immediately jumping into the Reincarnation Pool.

Chapter 2164: Returning to the Reincarnation Pool

On the dark earth, yellow rivers continuously churned, surrounding corpses and eroding those possessed by ghost soldiers.

Among the zombies, six figures continuously fought. Their auras were overwhelming as they surrounded Yang Huanyu. These six were Su Dan and others.

They had broken out of the Grand Formation to relieve pressure on the Lunzhuan Formation. They knew if the Grand Formation was broken, it would be over.

Luo Tian's sudden departure had caught them off guard. Fortunately, they had come out in time. If not for their timely interception of Yang Huanyu, Wang Gang might have suffered serious injuries.

"This is still a person? I feel he's even more变态 than Luo Tian!" Qiu Long coughed blood, his body battered and flying back, knocking over many zombies.

"Keep going for a while longer. If he uses that coffin technique three more times, I'll be able to learn it!" Mo Tian's eyes bled blood as his pupils merged again.

"His cultivation is growing too fast. The disciples can't die anymore. If they're all devoured by him, he might reach late Celestial King. That would definitely sweep us away!" Su Dan spoke, his voice filled with concern. The young man before them was too strong—fighting against six of them.

Although they had been distracted by the zombie army, it wasn't anyone who could achieve this feat.

"Divine Burial!" Yang Huanyu spoke again. A massive black coffin descended from the sky, its lid slowly opening and covering the six of them.

Wang Gang slashed a blade energy. Mo Tian, Hong Tao, and others also launched their techniques against the black coffin. However, it directly suppressed them.

"Escape..." The six exchanged glances and scattered. The black coffin had given them too much pressure.

"Boom..." A thunderous sound echoed, and the black coffin crashed onto the ground. The violent shockwave struck the six of them.

"Truly a good opponent. I need your cultivation!" Yang Huanyu's figure appeared like a ghost beside Qiu Long, his black spear slicing through the sky and striking toward Qiu Long.

"Get out!" Qiu Long roared. His fists were now two black fists, colliding fiercely with the ghostly spear.
