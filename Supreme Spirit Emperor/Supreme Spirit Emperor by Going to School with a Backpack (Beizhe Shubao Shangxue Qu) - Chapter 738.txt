"Damn the Dao!" Luo Tian suddenly understood. This was the Dao manipulating all three thousand small worlds to collide with the Immortal Realm. A single world colliding with the Immortal Realm caused tremors, but if all small worlds collided, no one would survive—neither the Immortals nor the people of the small worlds. Annihilation, complete and absolute! Crack... Suddenly, a sharp sound echoed from Luo Tian's dantian. His aura surged again, and the Imperial Seal within his dantian cracked with lines of light.

"The realm of the Three Ancient Emperors!" Luo Tian suddenly felt his strength surge, enough to confront the previous illusion of the Dao's projection in the heavens.

Yet those demon seeds still gathered toward Luo Tian endlessly, an infinite flow of power from the entire Immortal Realm to elevate him.

"Ahh!" Luo Tian roared, leaping toward a nearby nebula. He spread his hands, forming an endless hand that enveloped the entire nebula with a tremendous wave.

Chapter 2813: The Collapse of Ten Thousand Trials

The nebula drifted, but Luo Tian's unparalleled technique halted it. "Return!" Luo Tian roared, stepping on the stars to push the massive nebula away. However, this was a drop in the ocean; he could stop one or two but not over two thousand. After pushing back a nebula, Luo Tian realized even with his current strength, he couldn't stop them all. Helpless, he returned to the Immortal Realm but appeared in the blood-colored void instead.

"Master of Heaven!" Luo Tian's hands moved, his power surging. Black demon patterns spread across the heavens. As these patterns spread, the three thousand small worlds moving toward the Immortal Realm halted, frozen beneath the stars.

Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with joy. He clearly felt the Dao's will being influenced by him.

"Master Guiguzi truly did not deceive me!" Luo Tian's heart brimmed with joy. As he devoured the demon seeds, he channeled his power into the patterns, striving to reshape the Dao's will. The people of the Immortal Realm sighed in relief, sensing their pressure lessened—but they could only watch, as all their strength had plummeted to its lowest.

But when the people of the Immortal Realm just began to smile, a terrifying pressure intensified. From the blood-colored sky, tens of thousands of gray divine lights emerged, fiercely cutting through the black demon patterns.

"Hmph?" Luo Tian's expression shifted slightly. He sensed these gray lights weren't ordinary; they were soul-force, imbued with the Six Paths of Reincarnation.

"Is this what you sought to master hell?" Luo Tian instantly understood. His aura surged, and the soul-stabilizing aura of a魂师 (Soul Stabilizer) erupted. Countless souls spread, but they could not harm the soul-light infused with Six Paths of Reincarnation. Crack... Each demon pattern was severed, turning into swirling ash beneath the blood-colored sky.

As the patterns were cut, Luo Tian felt the halted three thousand small worlds resume their movement toward the Immortal Realm.

Boom... At that moment, his dantian erupted with explosive power. The cracked Imperial Seal shattered violently.

Having absorbed the cultivation of billions of lives in the Immortal Realm, Luo Tian's strength finally broke free from its chains, surpassing even the Three Ancient Emperors of antiquity. Yet Luo Tian spat blood, feeling his dantian rupture and his mind throb with pain. His mind's visions shifted. His dantian transformed into blackness, the shattered Imperial Seal dissolving into stars. His dantian resembled an entire cosmos; the visions in his mind were scenes of this cosmic evolution. Time rushed by swiftly—two breaths later, Luo Tian opened his eyes, but the time in his mind felt like millions of years.

"God!" Luo Tian whispered lowly. As he opened his eyes, dozens of nebulas had already descended upon the Immortal Realm's perimeter.

"Dao, today I, Luo Tian, shall be the one to slay you!" Luo Tian roared, his hands rapidly forming demon patterns etched onto his body. Simultaneously, his figure emerged from the void; he wanted to see those closest to him.

Luo Tian's presence appeared, his gaze sweeping over the people of the Tianyuan Sect. His eyes held boundless tenderness and regret.

"Qiu Chan, forgive me?"

"Si Xi, Qian Xue, Su Dan, Meng Ru, I'm sorry I can't walk this path with you!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice echoing in the ears of the five women.

"Luo Tian!" The five women cried out, gazing at Luo Tian standing like a deity in the sky.

"Xiao Jie, take care!" Luo Tian raised his hand, grasping his own body. Simultaneously, his bloodline power was drawn from him—this was the bond between Luo Tian and Long Jie.

"Zheng Xin, you bastard, stop nagging for once!"

"Lao Xu, take care..."

"Grave robbers... practice some virtue..."

"Zhan Biao, take care of yourself. Don't act impulsively; the one who can't bear it is you..."

"Father and mother, grandfather... I'm sorry for disappointing you..."

"Xiao Li, take care of your mother and brother..." Luo Tian's voice echoed simultaneously in each person's ear, filled with affection.

"I'm leaving!"

"Luo Tian! Today I shall fall this sky!" Luo Tian roared, his voice echoing through the nine heavens and ten earths. He strode through the sky toward the blood-colored void, his body constantly emitting demon qi as he vanished into it.

"Ten Thousand Demon Techniques!" A furious voice echoed. A resounding explosion thundered in the void, and instantly, black demon qi appeared above everyone's heads, spreading gradually.

"Luo Tian!" The people of the Tianyuan Sect roared but could only watch as Luo Tian rushed in. Ten thousand miles... a hundred million miles... In an instant, the blood-colored sky changed color. The entire Immortal Realm turned dark, and as the sky became black, the three thousand small worlds rushing toward the Immortal Realm suddenly halted.

Time passed. How long? A single golden light rose from the darkness, as if absorbing the black demon qi. The sky changed, restoring to a pale blue. Time stilled; a golden book slowly opened and expanded, enveloping the entire Immortal Realm. It flew beyond the domain, radiating a terrifying aura. Even more shocking was that the halted three thousand small worlds twisted, and even the Immortal Realm itself was absorbed into the golden book. Neither the people of the Immortal Realm nor the small worlds knew anything about it.

"Recovery..."

"Luo Tian succeeded. The Dao was destroyed!" People wept, the darkness having no concept of time or space.

"Success, but at a great cost. The Ancient Ancestor died, the Master of Breaking Heaven died, and Elder Yin passed away..." The people of Tianyuan wept.

"Luo Tian..." The entire Immortal Realm and Hell were immersed in joy and sorrow. Joy because they had survived this catastrophe, sorrow because it was bought with countless lives and blood.

Chapter 2814: The Great Conclusion

A peaceful era arrived. All beings in Hell and the Immortal Realm lost their cultivation, becoming ordinary people. No desire for conflict remained among them, but sects still existed, and people continued to cultivate diligently. The names of Luo Tian, Gu Tianshu, Long Que, and others were celebrated, with tales of this world-shaking battle spreading everywhere. The entire world erected statues of Luo Tian and his companions, who had become deities in the hearts of all. Perhaps future generations might cultivate to become emperors, but none would reach Luo Tian's height unless a new Dao order arose like now. But then, how many years would pass before strong beings emerged? No one knew what the Dao order would evolve into; it all depended on the Immortal Realm, Hell, and the three thousand small worlds.

A golden palace stood deep in the stars. A figure stood within, eyes enlightened, holding a golden book. If anyone from the Immortal Realm saw this figure, they would exclaim—this was their deity, Luo Tian!

"One page, one world..." Luo Tian murmured. He had previously unleashed the Ten Thousand Demon Techniques, shattering himself entirely. Luo Tian knew he succeeded; his consciousness was now the Dao's will. He remained in a hazy state, controlling the three thousand small worlds and halting them. After that, he lost consciousness but could clearly sense changes in the Immortal Realm and Hell. He understood the function of the Book of Epochs. Then, with his final will, he forcibly sent the soul fragments of Gu Tianshu and other masters into the Six Paths of Reincarnation.

Afterward, Luo Tian was guided by a wave of energy into this palace. Beside him was the Book of Epochs, through which he could still sense changes in every corner of the Immortal Realm and track anyone's movements.

"Haha, brother, welcome to the Honghuang Palace. Congratulations on becoming the ninth deity of the entire Honghuang realm!" A loud laugh echoed, and eight figures appeared in the palace, interrupting Luo Tian's daze.

"Who are you?" Luo Tian gazed at the eight, his eyes filled with confusion. Yet their auras made him realize their power.

"Long time no see new arrivals; we were lonely!" A burly man chuckled, his eyes smiling.

"I'll introduce you. This is the first deity of our Honghuang realm, Honghun. This one's called Hongjun..." The man spoke continuously, finally introducing himself as Pangu.

"Deities?" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with understanding. Above the Immortal Emperor came deities, and the mark of becoming a deity was defying the Dao, mastering a world.

"Good brothers!" Luo Tian quickly bowed, greeting them. In his view, their strength definitely surpassed him; compared to these people, he was still one level behind—though this gap would shrink over time.

"We've finally gathered the nine of us. We were waiting for you..." The burly man spoke, his eyes filled with emotion.

"Indeed. You are the last deity of our Honghuang realm. Each realm may only have nine deities..."

"Honghuang realm?" Luo Tian asked, sensing their words implied other realms.

"I don't know about other realms, but our Honghuang realm is vast. It has nine world-trees, and your previous Immortal Realm was the trunk. The three thousand small worlds are its fruits..."

"And this book in your hands is one of nine across the Honghuang realm. It's an artifact of Honghun, capable of absorbing world-trees' existence!"

"Perhaps we can explore later. The universe is vast beyond our imagination; maybe other realms exist too. All depends on you, little brother. Since you've just become a deity, you might still miss your homeland. Once you stabilize as a deity, you can return to your former world!" Pangu spoke.

"Thank you, elder brothers!" Luo Tian quickly clasped his fists. He truly missed home.

"Alright, there's no restraint here. Just these few people; when you have time, you can visit our realms too!" They began chatting. Luo Tian was a generous man and quickly became familiar with them.

Time flowed slowly. Luo Tian's strength gradually stabilized. With excitement, he opened the Book of Epochs, his consciousness plunging into it.

At the same time, Luo Tian's will encompassed the entire Immortal Realm. Using Dao power, he condensed a space without time—mountains rose from the ground, resembling the Five Elements Mountain of his former Tianyuan Continent. A figure solidified on the mountain's peak, Luo Tian's face showing a smile.

"This... eternal life!" Luo Tian spoke. This space was the Eternal Life Realm; anyone entering it would never age.

... In the Immortal Realm, Tianyuan Sect.

Tianyuan Sect had become the ruler of the Immortal Realm, though it rarely interfered with worldly matters.

"Five hundred years since Tian'er shattered the Dao. It seems Tian'er truly vanished..." In a quiet courtyard of Tianyuan Sect, Luo Nantian and his wife sat, whispering.

Five hundred years passed like a blink. The Immortal Realm had new strong individuals—many had reached the stage of Immortal King.

"Father, mother, grandfather..." As they spoke, a voice echoed in Luo Nantian's and his wife's ears, as well as the ears of their white-haired Luo Xiong. The three were startled.

"Did I hear wrong?" Luo Nantian shook his head; he often had hallucinations recently.

But as they questioned, the void twisted, emitting an irresistible pull that dragged them in.

"Tian'er!" In a moment, the three appeared in the space Luo Tian created, gazing at Luo Tian before them with disbelief.

"I must be dreaming!" Luo Xiong slapped Luo Nantian's head, the slap echoing. Luo Nantian cried out.

"Dad... I'm your real son..." Luo Nantian felt dizzy but immediately looked at Luo Tian with excitement.

"Tian'er, is it you?" Luo Nantian rushed forward, embracing Luo Tian.

"Dad, let's talk later. I'll find the others first," Luo Tian spoke, supporting Luo Nantian.

Luo Tian waved his hand. Five exquisite women appeared before him—his five beautiful wives.

"Dearest, I've missed you all!" Luo Tian laughed, splitting into five and embracing the women.

"You..." The five women wept instantly, feeling warmth in their arms, unwilling to let go—though this dream had become a habit for them.

After embracing and comforting them, Luo Tian gathered people one by one. All his old friends and relatives were brought into this space, making it lively.

"Those bastards! You all ignored my last words!" When he noticed Sun Kemin and Diao Dezhu, among others, he couldn't help but curse. Yet his face showed a smile.

Luo Tian observed: a small group of people searched for opportunities in an Immortal King's late-stage tomb.

Sun Kemin, Diao Dezhu, Sima Tuo, Zhang Chenglong—these four were no good. Zheng Xin and Xu Lizi益 were acceptable. What infuriated Luo Tian was that Luo Li, Luo Su, and Gu Guanyu were also among them.

"Damn bastards! I'll teach you!" Luo Tian gritted his teeth, feeling Sun Kemin and Diao Dezhu had corrupted his son. Corrupting one was bad enough, but corrupting another was unbearable.

"I'll teach you!" Luo Tian cursed, waving his hand...

Luo Tian's antics didn't go unnoticed. Diao Dezhu and Sun Kemin's group suffered: pills turned into hard stones, breaking their teeth; they were chased by monsters; treasures seemed to appear but revealed piles of excrement. Diao Dezhu's group fled the tomb, staring at its entrance with twitching mouths.

Crash... As they just emerged, thunderstorms erupted in the sky, repeatedly striking them. They were scorched and smoking.

"Damn weird!" Sun Kemin cursed, his head swollen. He wiped the pile of excrement he'd dug up onto Diao Dezhu's body.

"Son of a bitch, where are you wiping? I'll kill you, Diao Dezhu!" Diao Dezhu was smoking, now being smeared with that excrement by Sun Kemin. Diao Dezhu was furious.

At this moment, Luo Tian had finished teasing them and grabbed them with an invisible hand.

"Done! Done! Only five hundred years, how could there be such a strong person!" Sun Kemin cursed as he was pulled into the space where Luo Tian and others were.

"Luo... Luo Tian..." The group fell to the ground, seeing smiling faces. A familiar face appeared in Sun Kemin's view, making them jump up and rush toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian, upon everyone's arrival, recounted his experiences. The group was stunned.

"This is the Eternal Life Realm... you can live forever here. It doesn't matter; I am now the master of this world. However, I won't interfere with your lives. You can continue living as you wish..." Luo Tian spoke. If he forced changes, their lives would lose joy.

The group celebrated on the Five Elements Mountain, jubilant. Luo Tian's survival was enough to make them happy for days.

Under the night, Luo Tian walked to the back of the Five Elements Mountain. He waved his hand, and a black spear appeared on the ground. He buried it with earth.

"Finally, this karmic debt is settled," Luo Tian sighed. He didn't erect a tomb for it, turning away.

In the following time, Luo Tian found Long Que, the Master of the Demon and God, and the Master of Breaking Heaven's reincarnations. He briefly restored their memories, asking if they wished to remember—but all chose to continue living in reincarnation. Luo Tian didn't insist, erasing their memories and returning them to the right path.

The only mystery was that Luo Tian couldn't find Gu Tianshu's presence. Even when he asked other deities to search their realms, they found nothing.

Moreover, one person remained missing—Dongbo Xin. After their parting in the Ghost Swamp, Luo Tian had never met Dongbo Xin again, not even during the Immortal Realm's turmoil.

"Search! No matter where, I'll find them!" Luo Tian was resolute. They wouldn't die.

"Little Brother, we have a new discovery. Ten million miles away in the Honghuang realm lies an altar. If we repair it, perhaps we can leave the Honghuang realm!"

"Moreover, on this altar, we found traces of reincarnation. It has the energy of those two people!" Pangu's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

Luo Tian slightly smiled. "If they're not in the Honghuang realm, I'll search other realms!"

... The End.

Author's Note: This concludes the story. Thank you for subscribing to my book over three years. It's neither long nor short; many may no longer read it, whether they criticized or encouraged me. Without you, I couldn't have persisted for three years. Sincerely thank you all. I left a small mystery—Gu Tianshu is my favorite character in this book, even surpassing the protagonist at times. I don't want him to be inferior to Luo Tian; please forgive me, haha. Finally, thank you all again. Farewell, and I can finally rest.
