Chapter 656: Nine-Level Formation

The Xian Gu Continent's Questioning Cliff was teeming with energy, radiant lights flashing, and the sound of breaking through the sky echoing ceaselessly. At this moment, the geniuses from the Tian Yuan Continent who had been separated were once again gathered together.

Yet, these individuals radiated powerful fluctuations; the weakest among them had reached the peak of Yuan Ling, while most were Soul-Annihilation Realm masters. Clearly, on this vast Xian Gu Continent, the people from Tian Yuan had enhanced their strength to an astonishing degree.

Luo Tian and his companions walked among the crowd, faces filled with surprise, silently nodding in approval. This force, if returned to Tian Yuan, would certainly sweep through all sects and even rule the continent without difficulty.

"Luotian!" People saw Luo Tian's group, their faces filled with disbelief.
"How did these top-tier geniuses gather together?" Their gazes held astonishment. Though Luo Tian's appearance was ordinary, he was instantly recognized. Moreover, before him stood Zhou Ziyang and Jin Wulong—both renowned figures in the Southern Region.

The gathering place of the Northern Region, Luo Tian saw many familiar faces. All those connected to him had assembled here, including people from the Eastern and Southern Regions. As for the Western Region's few individuals, Luo Tian had yet to spot any trace of them.

When Luo Tian stood before these people, their faces all bore smiles. Chen Changsheng and Ying Hongtu had already reached the peak of Soul-Annihilation Realm.

Cold Autumn Cicada and Gu Qianxue were also at the Soul-Annihilation peak, their auras formidable. At this moment, the number of strong individuals surrounding Luo Tian accounted for nearly a third of those present.

Seeing Luo Tian's formidable force, others' faces bore shock as they gazed at him, surprised that after traversing the Xian Gu Ruins, Luo Tian had gathered such a powerful force.

"Luotian!" Jiang Nanxuan remained his usual composed demeanor, standing before Luo Tian with a faint smile.
"Senior Jiang!" The enhancement of his strength made Luo Tian feel that Jiang Nanxuan was even more extraordinary. Even Tian Luo, who had been joking with Zheng Xin, narrowed his eyes slightly upon seeing Jiang Nanxuan. Upon realizing Jiang Nanxuan was a friend of Luo Tian, he returned to normal.

"Senior Brother Tian, I must say, Jiang Nanxuan was my first true confidant! Luotian is the second. The third is that sly-looking Xu Liyi! I'll introduce him to you later; we can chat for days!" Zheng Xin was genuinely delighted, surprised that those he connected with had all arrived.

"Great Formation..." Luo Tian gazed at the towering cliff before him, his expression darkened.

Though he felt no fluctuation of a formation, Luo Tian knew entering the Questioning Cliff was no simple task. He could clearly sense that all the surrounding energy was flowing purposefully toward the cliff's summit.

"Senior Jiang, can this formation be broken?" Luo Tian approached Jiang Nanxuan, his face filled with anticipation. He knew Jiang Nanxuan had a unique talent for formations.

"A nine-level formation? It's not that easy to break!" Jiang Nanxuan's face remained calm, sighing.

Upon hearing Jiang Nanxuan's words, Cold Autumn Cicada and others bore a hint of disappointment. They had known there was an incredible inheritance within, yet they could only watch helplessly, unable to enter.

"Don't worry; if my guess is correct, since it's a formation, there must be a way to break it!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke, rekindling hope in those with despair. They awaited his next words eagerly.

"The key to entering the Questioning Cliff is the Xian Gu Dao Ling. This must be the inheritance left by this World Sovereign to find those worthy of inheriting!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke, continuously fiddling with the Xian Gu Dao Ling in his hand. To Luo Tian's shock, Jiang Nanxuan held the main Xian Gu Dao Ling.

"Twelve main Xian Gu Dao Lings, plus ten thousand subsidiary ones, would prevent this great formation from attacking us—The Heavenly诛魔 Formation!" Jiang Nanxuan explained to the group.

Upon hearing Jiang Nanxuan's words, Luo Tian and others all took out their Xian Gu Dao Lings, their gazes filled with confusion.

Seeing Luo Tian's group taking out the Xian Gu Dao Lings, others followed suit, also retrieving theirs.

"Let's go! With the Xian Gu Dao Lings, this formation won't harm us!" Jiang Nanxuan smiled, taking Meng Yao's hand and walking calmly toward the Questioning Cliff.

"Senior Jiang, be careful!" Cold Autumn Cicada and others looked on with anxiety as Jiang Nanxuan walked calmly.

Previously, someone had approached the Questioning Cliff like this and was instantly crushed by violent energy within a breath, which is why no one dared to enter. They remained in place instead.

"Who is this? Why does he seem like an ordinary person, seeking death?" People's faces bore astonishment as they watched Jiang Nanxuan approach the cliff.

But in an instant, their faces turned to shock. Jiang Nanxuan and Meng Yao glowed with a soft light, vanishing from sight as if the Xian Gu Dao Gate had opened again.

"Xian Gu Dao Ling! Again, Xian Gu Dao Ling! Damned!" Those without Xian Gu Dao Lings looked frenzied, their gazes turning凶残 toward those around them.

The inheritance of a World Sovereign was enough to stir anyone's desire. At this moment, people began searching for those with Xian Gu Dao Lings.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian sighed, not bothering to care about the chaos already beginning. He led his group forward, knowing that against a World Sovereign's inheritance, no words of persuasion would help.

After sighing at the further depletion of Tian Yuan Continent's strength, Luo Tian led his group into the Questioning Cliff.

No one dared to target this group; it would be suicide. Those without Xian Gu Dao Lings but similar to Luo Tian stayed outside, trusting Luo Tian's instructions to avoid conflicts and preserve their strength.

As Luo Tian's group entered the Questioning Cliff, others sighed in relief. Soon after, the scene turned chaotic. Those with Xian Gu Dao Lings became targets of pursuit. Thunderous roars echoed, various martial arts swirling above the remaining three thousand people, darkening the sky.

Chapter 657: The Inheritance of the World Sovereign

The Xian Gu Continent's Questioning Cliff was stained red with blood. Three thousand Soul-Annihilation and Yuan Ling peak warriors were locked in a fierce battle, with people constantly rushing into the cliff and falling to the ground, their eyes filled with regret. The area before the Questioning Cliff was brutal.

Those close to Luo Tian bore relief, about five thousand people standing there, relieved they hadn't joined the bloody fight.

"What do you think these people are after? With Luo Tian, Tian Luo, and others like this group, what could they possibly achieve?"

"For power, for strength. Even with a chance, they wouldn't let it slip away! This is the cultivation world! But how many years have Tian Yuan and Xian Gu Continents existed? Though they've become World Sovereigns, who truly reached the peak and achieved immortality?" People murmured, their gazes filled with admiration.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian's group entered the Questioning Cliff, their faces filled with apprehension. A World Sovereign was beyond their level; they couldn't help but be wary.

"Where is Jiang Nanxuan?" Zheng Xin asked, not seeing Jiang Nanxuan's figure upon entering. His face bore concern.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, first observing the surroundings. This place was completely different from what they saw outside—no longer a towering cliff, but a vast cave with countless entrances before them.

Not seeing Jiang Nanxuan's presence made Luo Tian feel strange. His instinct told him Jiang Nanxuan was fine; that man had means to make anyone wary.

"So many caves, how do we proceed?" Zheng Xin looked at Luo Tian with confusion, others also awaiting his decision.

"Split up! So many caves must be the tests given by the World Sovereign. As for what they are, we'll know after entering!" Luo Tian smiled, said goodbye to the group, then stepped into a random cave entrance.

Luo Tian walked along the black passage, endless darkness instantly enveloping him. Then the Xian Gu Dao Ling emitted radiant light, making Luo Tian vanish from his original spot.

In an instant, he appeared in a place that left him astonished, his face filled with admiration.

Before him, it seemed he stood in the void, countless stars surrounding him. He felt as if he were the master of this world.

"Roar..." A deep roar echoed in Luo Tian's ears. Next moment, he found himself in an endless space filled with various strange creatures, their strength around the Body-Refining and Bone-Transformation realms.

"Unleash your full power, use only one strike to kill the creatures before you. The more you kill, the higher your score. The top twelve will have a chance to inherit my legacy!" An old voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears, shaking his spirit.

"Is this the World Sovereign Jiang Hongsheng?" Luo Tian's brows furrowed, unsure of what this great being was up to.

At the same time, others encountered the same situation, all frowning at the dense horde of creatures.

"Never mind!" Zheng Xin wore an indifferent expression, his hands moving swiftly, forming a powerful fluctuation. A wind-element palm gradually formed in the sky, slowly descending toward the creatures before him, which were at most Bone-Transformation realm.

Other cave entrances also roared with thunder, a storm formed by Xiu, wreaking havoc among the beast horde. Tian Luo's eyes flashed with brilliance; a spiritual energy hand slowly descended toward the ground, others also unleashing their strongest martial arts to attack the beast horde. After all, entering the Questioning Cliff meant following the World Sovereign's rules.

"Previously, the Xian Gu Ruins had opened before, but no one ever obtained this coveted World Sovereign inheritance. I suppose the World Sovereign's test isn't simple!" Luo Tian muttered, lightly stretching his body.

"An illusion!" Luo Tian instantly felt the scene before him was an illusion. So many creatures couldn't fit in such a small Questioning Cliff. Plus, he had entered countless illusions before, so he was certain this was an illusion—just one that was incredibly lifelike.

"A nine-level formation master's World Sovereign, his methods are truly astonishing!" Luo Tian's lips curled slightly.

"My strongest attack is the three-element fusion seal infused with chaotic energy!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, his hands moving swiftly. Two seals quickly hovered above his head.

But just as the two seals were about to fuse, Luo Tian's eyes flashed with brilliance.

"The three-element fusion seal is indeed terrifying, but it's unsuitable for mass attacks! I think I've found a better method here!" Luo Tian smiled, as his body emitted thunderous sounds.

Originally, Luo Tian's slender frame began to swell gradually, a powerful aura forming within his body. Yet, his face bore a smile.

"Self-explosion!" Luo Tian roared, and his body exploded like a balloon, but the terrifying power was billions of times stronger than a balloon's explosion.

Invisible waves spread from Luo Tian's self-explosion, sweeping through the area. The creatures fell in droves, like crops trampled underfoot, vanishing into the vast space.

Apocalyptic destruction—The power of a Soul-Annihilation peak's self-explosion, though weaker than that of a魂凝境 (Soul-Consolidation) master, was still beyond the capacity of these Bone-Transformation level creatures.

"Three thousand feet... ten thousand feet... thirty thousand feet..." All the creatures within a three-mile radius vanished from space.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian's figure instantly appeared at the cave entrance, his face filled with a smile.

"Who could have thought of such a method?" Luo Tian spoke softly, as Cold Autumn Cicada and others also appeared at the cave entrance, waiting for others to emerge and see what other challenges the Questioning Cliff held.

Chapter 658: Ten Thousand to One Hundred

Seeing Luo Tian's emergence, people bore a look of joy, surrounding him.

Initially, they thought Luo Tian, being the first to enter, would be the first to exit. Yet he not only didn't come out first but was last, causing Gu Qianxue and others to feel joy.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian emerged, a massive light screen appeared at the cave's ceiling, with one hundred names appearing on it, followed by a series of numbers.

"Zheng Xin: ten thousand?" Zheng Xin's face bore excitement, looking at others. But soon he noticed others gazed at Luo Tian as if seeing a monster.

"Luo Tian! One million one hundred thousand!" Tian Luo's calm face also bore a hint of shock, gazing at Luo Tian. He couldn't fathom what method he used to kill one million one hundred thousand Bone-Transformation level creatures.

"Is this guy even human?" People's gazes held doubt, looking at Luo Tian.

"Damn it, Luo Tian, you're too fierce! You killed one million one hundred thousand! What method did you use? Even self-explosion isn't this strong!" Xu Liyi spoke without restraint, shouting.

Chen Zhanbao's face bore a gloomy expression, standing before Xu Liyi, as his name wasn't even on the sky.

Chen Zhanbao was skilled in hand-to-hand combat, with no spiritual energy. Compared to others with martial arts, he suffered a significant disadvantage.

"Indeed, it was self-explosion!" Luo Tian's lips curled slightly, nodding to Xu Liyi.

"What?" Xu Liyi was about to continue speaking but was choked by Luo Tian's words.

Others hearing Luo Tian's words also bore shock, gazing at him in disbelief. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to use such a method.

"Self-explosion, his courage is truly bold!" People murmured, some guessing the place was an illusion but no one dared to gamble. After all, if it were real and he self-explosed, he'd die too painfully.

"This is cheating, right?" Soon after, people's faces bore a defiant spirit.

"The top twelve who killed the most will have a chance to inherit my legacy, while the remaining eighty-eight can vie for the twelve Emperor positions under my rule!" An old voice echoed in people's minds, causing their bodies to tremble.

"One hundred thousand people, only most were eliminated in the first phase, leaving over a hundred!" Many faces bore regret, their gazes filled with envy as they looked at the one hundred names on the light screen.

Luo Tian gazed at the sky's light screen, himself ranked first, Tian Luo second, Xiu third, Zhou Ziyang fourth, Duan Xingchen fifth, and sixth was Shangguan Hongtu, which surprised Luo Tian.

Cold Autumn Cicada, Xu Liyi, Luo Han, and two others he didn't recognize were also on the list. Yet, he was certain these two were top talents from the Southern Region and ranked highly there. Chen Changsheng was at the twelfth position.

Luo Tian saw the names, feeling a slight sigh. The Northern Region was indeed much weaker than other regions; only Chen Changsheng ranked twelfth among the top twelve.

Although others' scores were good, entering the top hundred, they still lagged behind other regions.

However, seeing the top twelve names, Luo Tian's face bore a faint smile. Among these people, except for Shangguan Hongtu and two others, the rest had some connection with him. Thus, no matter who obtained the inheritance, it would be good news for him.

"Others, go out!" A deep voice echoed, sending the nine thousand eliminated people out of the Questioning Cliff.

"Damn it, this is a waste!" People cursed repeatedly, their faces filled with anger. Thinking about how they had barely obtained the chance to enter the Questioning Cliff from a sea of corpses, they felt deep regret.

"Buzz..." After these people were sent out, others were transported to the outside of the Questioning Cliff and merged with those without Xian Gu Dao Lings.

Before them, another hundred cave entrances appeared, making Luo Tian and others' lips twitch slightly.

"Is this World Sovereign a rat?" A Soul-Annihilation mid-level genius sneered, speaking softly.

"Boom..." In an instant, this Soul-Annihilation mid-level youth turned into a mist of blood under people's terrified gazes.

"Those who insult the master shall die!" A cold voice made everyone's hearts jump, and they finally清醒. This was the tomb of a World Sovereign—care must be taken; even one word must be carefully chosen, or else there would be a death sentence.

"You may choose the cave entrance yourself! As before, just pick one. Those who pass will have the qualification to receive the inheritance of the twelve Emperors. If you wish to vie for the master's inheritance, there will be further tests—though those will concern life and death!" The cold voice spoke sternly, no longer the previous gentle and aged image.

"This must be the guardian spirit of this cave!" Luo Tian thought, continuously observing the cave, his face filled with contemplation.

"Let's go!" After greeting Gu Qianxue and others, others also walked toward the cave entrances.

As soon as they entered the entrance, Luo Tian's eyes brightened; golden light made him momentarily unaccustomed.

After regaining his composure, Luo Tian found himself in a grand hall, which appeared vast and empty, devoid of any life. Yet, thousands of feet away, a middle-aged man sat cross-legged, his face serene, as if the sun itself.

Though the middle-aged man seemed calm, Luo Tian felt he was like a sword not yet drawn from its sheath. A powerful pressure emanated from him, making Luo Tian feel waves of oppression.

"A cultivator who has grasped a fragment of chaotic energy!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, his gaze cautious.

Though he had encountered countless cultivators who grasped a fragment of chaotic energy in the Xian Gu world, those had no ill intent toward him, like Sichu Chen or Jiang Bailuan.

But this didn't mean Luo Tian feared a Soul-Consolidation peak cultivator who had grasped chaotic energy. Though he was strong, against such a master, he was akin to an ant.

Moreover, Luo Tian could sense the pressure from this middle-aged man's physical body was even stronger than Sichu Chen and others.

As Luo Tian pondered, the middle-aged man's eyes slowly opened. Two wisps of gray energy emerged before him, then re-entered his slightly parted mouth.

With the energy's entry, a series of thunderous sounds echoed from the middle-aged man's body, making Luo Tian's heart more cautious.

"Crack... crack..." The middle-aged man slowly stood up, his eyes no longer filled with gray but instead a profound gaze, scanning Luo Tian.

"The main Xian Gu Dao Ling has the qualifications to inherit my legacy!" The middle-aged man smiled, speaking to Luo Tian.

"Greetings, elder!" Luo Tian bowed slightly, clasping his fists toward the middle-aged man.

"Defeat me, and you shall inherit my legacy!" The middle-aged man spoke, his gaze filled with a faint smile.

"Damn it! No one has ever obtained this inheritance in so many years! How can a Soul-Annihilation peak cultivator defeat one who has grasped chaotic energy and is at the Soul-Consolidation peak? This is impossible!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly, yet his face bore respect.

"Respectful elder, I dare not challenge you!" As he spoke, Luo Tian bowed again.

"Interesting little fellow. Don't worry; I am merely a fragment of a soul. Even my ability to possess is nonexistent. You need not fear; since you call me elder, I won't let you call in vain. I'll seal my cultivation to the Soul-Consolidation peak initial stage. If you still can't defeat me, then there's truly no chance!"

"Also, this fragment of my soul only has one minute. That means you must defeat me within a minute to pass! If you fail, I'll have to wait a thousand years until my soul solidifies!" The middle-aged man spoke, his gaze filled with a faint smile.

"Boom..." Before the middle-aged man's words finished, Luo Tian's voice appeared before him. A punch of destruction struck the middle-aged man.

"One minute? That's enough!" Hearing the middle-aged man's words, Luo Tian's face bore confidence. He stood calmly before the middle-aged man.

"Good kid!" Seeing Luo Tian's sneak attack, the middle-aged man showed no anger but instead admiration.

At the same time, Luo Tian's next punch of轮回 (Cyclic) struck the middle-aged man.

"Boom..." The middle-aged man remained calm, striking a single punch. Invisible waves rose between them, echoing thunderous sounds.

"This space is reinforced by a formation. Indeed, the nine-level formation master's work! A Soul-Annihilation peak attack has no fluctuation at all!" Luo Tian expressed admiration, his gaze more cautious.

"This middle-aged man is clearly no ordinary person. Even at the Soul-Consolidation peak initial stage, I can't defeat him now! Let alone defeating him within a minute!" Through the two punches, Luo Tian felt his gap with this middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man said no more, his hands flashing gold light, leaving a residual image. Within less than a breath, a golden hand appeared in the air, striking Luo Tian.

"Good thing it's a single-element gold body!" Luo Tian sighed, his hands moving swiftly. He unleashed the Kai Tian Seal immediately.

The golden seal collided with the middle-aged man's spiritual energy hand, vanishing into the heavens.

"Little fellow, your martial arts are good, but this alone won't beat me!" The middle-aged man's face bore a playful expression, transforming into a golden streak.

Luo Tian didn't dare to confront directly; this man had sealed his cultivation to the Soul-Consolidation peak initial stage, but his physical body couldn't be sealed. Though confident in his own physique, Luo Tian wasn't foolish enough to test it.

"No choice but to do this!" Luo Tian stepped with the Fengtian Step, vanishing from his original spot. His seven souls began to burn slowly.

"Seventh Soul!" Luo Tian roared, his body's aura rising sharply. His cultivation level, which had been at the Soul-Annihilation peak, rapidly ascended. A series of cracks echoed from his body.

"Secret technique? A good secret technique!" The middle-aged man halted, waiting for Luo Tian's technique to complete.

Within tens of breaths, sweat appeared on Luo Tian's face. His cultivation level remained at the Soul-Consolidation peak initial stage, boosting his confidence.

"Crack..." Luo Tian flexed his fists slightly. The space around him began to twist, making Luo Tian's face bear a smile. He was certain that if he were outside, this punch would tear through space.

"Soul-Consolidation peak truly powerful! Though I haven't凝聚 (concentrated) the three souls of a Soul-Consolidation peak, I should now be fearless against most Soul-Consolidation peak initial stage masters!" Luo Tian smiled, his body moving swiftly to the middle-aged man's front. He unleashed Cyclic and Destruction punches.

Seeing Luo Tian's state, the middle-aged man's eyes narrowed slightly, his usual calm face showing a hint of seriousness.

Golden light flashed again; the middle-aged man's body was enveloped in golden spiritual energy, forming a golden armor that covered him. He looked like a war god, striking a punch that shook the heavens.

"Boom..." The two punches collided, shaking the hall three times. Luo Tian's body was sent flying backward, colliding with the wall reinforced by the formation, emitting a series of resonant sounds.

The middle-aged man wasn't faring much better; his golden spiritual energy armor shattered under Luo Tian's two punches, and he continuously retreated.

"Soul-Consolidation peak truly formidable!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, his face showing excitement. His hands moved swiftly, fusing the King's Seal and Soul-Stealing Seal.

"Seal fusion!" The middle-aged man's eyes flashed with brilliance, then his hands also moved.

"Huangji Seal!" Luo Tian roared, the golden Huangji Seal already formed in his hand. It carried the aura of an emperor, striking toward the middle-aged man.

"Huangquan Tiannu" (Hades' Wrath), at the same time, the middle-aged man's martial arts gradually formed. Golden waves with overwhelming power surged from his hands.

"Rippling..." The golden seal and golden waves collided, creating a powerful fluctuation that sent both Luo Tian and the middle-aged man retreating.

Chapter 659: Mountain-Crushing Scripture

Luo Tian's figure was instantly submerged by the golden waves, while the Huangji Seal pierced through the golden waves' layers of resistance, striking the middle-aged man.

"Boom..." Both collided with the hall's wall. Luo Tian's lips bled, his face filled with shock—unbelieving that he still couldn't defeat the middle-aged man.

"Shortage of martial arts!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, feeling his current martial arts were insufficient. Though his techniques were powerful enough to crush any Soul-Annihilation peak master, compared to the martial arts of a true Soul-Consolidation peak master, they were still one level behind.

"Little fellow, you're quite good!" The middle-aged man also wiped his lips, his face showing satisfaction as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"Again!" Luo Tian's face bore an indomitable spirit, his hands moving swiftly again.

"Good, little fellow. I'll consider you passed if you withstand this technique!" The middle-aged man's face showed satisfaction, gazing at Luo Tian. His hands flashed golden light.

"Three Seals United!" Luo Tian roared, the Five Elements' Life-Generating Seal and Soul-Stealing Seal appearing in his hands again.

"Little fellow, I warn you—my next technique is my ultimate secret. If you use the previous two seals to fuse, you won't be able to withstand it!" The middle-aged man's brows furrowed slightly, but his hands didn't stop. A heavy aura emanated from him.

"Kai Tian!" Luo Tian seemed not to hear the middle-aged man's words, roaring again. A golden seal sliced through the void above their heads.

Luo Tian's current strength was only slightly inferior to a true Soul-Consolidation peak master. If not for the middle-aged man's numerous techniques, he might have already won.

Kai Tian Seal was Luo Tian's current strongest technique besides fused martial arts and the ultimate power of Lili Fire. His current Kai Tian Seal was comparable to a Heaven-Level martial art.

"Merge!" Luo Tian roared, the three seals slowly fusing together under the middle-aged man's gaze.

"Genius!" The middle-aged man's eyes shone with brilliance, watching Luo Tian fuse three martial arts together. He couldn't find words to describe Luo Tian.

Seeing the middle-aged man's admiring gaze, Luo Tian smiled inwardly. He wanted to see what the middle-aged man would look like if he saw him fusing a fragment of chaotic energy into these three seals.

But Luo Tian ultimately restrained himself; even in his current state, he wasn't sure if he could survive under the destructive power of that.

"It's enough!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, the three seals slowly fusing together above the sky. The void became blurred under the terrifying pressure of the seals, with black cracks forming around them.

"Mountain-Crushing Scripture!" The middle-aged man's gaze held admiration, looking at the seals above. His fluctuations became even more terrifying.

"Buzz..." A golden mountain formed, like a meteor from the void, striking Luo Tian's seal. The terrifying pressure was no less than that of Luo Tian's three seals fused together.

"High-Level Heaven-Level Martial Art!" Luo Tian's eyes showed admiration, surprised the middle-aged man had a High-Level Heaven-Level martial art.

"Go!" The golden mountain, under the middle-aged man's command, transformed into a streak of gold, striking Luo Tian's seal.

Luo Tian showed no fear at all; he was fully confident that his current fused three-seal technique could withstand a High-Level Heaven-Level martial art.

"Explosion..." Just as the seals and golden mountain collided, the middle-aged man roared.

"Boom..." Thunderous sounds echoed. Under Luo Tian's astonished gaze, the golden mountain shattered violently, and the terrifying fluctuation tore off the hall's roof.

Luo Tian's three-seal fusion also shattered under this explosion's pull, collapsing half of the void.

The powerful fluctuation nearly made Luo Tian kneel on the ground, his face filled with admiration.

After the fluctuation faded, a vast starry sky appeared in Luo Tian and the middle-aged man's view. Moonlight fell on the middle-aged man's body.

"Excellent! Time was just right!" The middle-aged man's face bore a faint smile, his aura soaring. He snapped his fingers, and Luo Tian's figure appeared before him.

"My name is Jin Leiren; I am the Golden Emperor under World Sovereign Jiang Hongsheng. Since you've passed, I'll entrust my inheritance to you!" The middle-aged man spoke, revealing his name, which made Luo Tian's spirit tremble.

"Xian Gu Twelve Emperors! Golden Emperor!" Luo Tian whispered, his gaze filled with reverence.
