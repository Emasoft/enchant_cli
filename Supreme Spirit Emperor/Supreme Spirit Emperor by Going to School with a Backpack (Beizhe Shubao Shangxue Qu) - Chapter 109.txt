Luo Tian cast a wary glance around the room before stepping inside.

As Luo Tian entered the chamber, his expression darkened with contemplation. He sighed inwardly: "These past few days, I should remain low-key. I must find a way to advance. If I can reach the Middle Nascent Soul stage, or even the Late Nascent Soul stage, my strength will surely improve significantly!"

With that, Luo Tian retrieved a pill from his storage ring. A fierce glint flickered across his face. As the pill touched his palm, the surrounding primordial energy trembled, swirling toward it in a frenzy.

"Seventh-Rank Pill—One-Mind Pill!" Luo Tian murmured softly.

This pill had been seized by Luo Tian from Dan Yuyan during the Wind-Blade Valley incident, when she had attempted to heal Zheng Xin. By chance, Luo Tian had forgotten to return it, and Dan Yuyan never dared to demand its return.

"Forgive you two for this," Luo Tian said without hesitation, placing the pill into his mouth.

Chapter 533: Advancing to the Late Nascent Soul Stage

Chapter 533: Advancing to the Late Nascent Soul Stage

At the very moment Luo Tian swallowed the pill, the main branch of the Luo family's current leadership grew solemn.

In a vast hall, an elder sat at the center, radiating authority. His gaze fell upon Li Xingfa, who had fallen to his knees in fear.

"Who gave you this information?" the elder asked, his voice sharp.

"A senior," Li Xingfa replied respectfully. "I don't know his name, but I felt fear at his presence. He told me this information could fetch twenty million primordial energy stones from the Ice Extreme Island."

The elder nodded slightly, then waved his hand. Twenty million primordial energy stones materialized before Li Xingfa, causing his eyes to gleam.

Without hesitation, Li Xingfa scooped up the stones, his face alight with excitement as he thanked the elder profusely.

"No need for thanks," the elder said. "This is your due. However, there's another matter to settle: were you among the four who caused trouble in Xuanbing City?" His eyes flashed like lightning, piercing Li Xingfa's mind.

The gaze sent a shudder through Li Xingfa, who paled in terror. But before he could react, his body dissolved into nothingness, leaving no trace of blood.

After finishing this, the elder retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve—a fragment sent by Xuanbing City's people.

He tossed the jade slip onto the floor, where it unfolded. "These four caused chaos in Xuanbing City. Go and find them. Bring them to the Ice Extreme Island. I wish to see who dares challenge our authority!"

The hall's occupants lowered their gazes to the jade slip, which displayed images of Luo Tian, Xu Liyi, and Chen Zhanbiao. The fourth figure, Li Xingfa, was already dead.

The elder nodded to several elders at the hall's edge, who immediately departed.

"Word has it that Luo Xiong's grandson, Luo Tian, has returned," the elder said to the remaining elders.

Hearing this and sensing the killer intent in his eyes, a middle-aged man stepped forward. "Third Uncle, it's true. According to our subordinates, Li Xingfa was with Luo Tian when they arrived at the Ice Extreme Island. Should we..."

"Hmph... Not yet. Their branch has declined; they pose no threat. Though the younger generation is strong, to Han'er, they are merely stepping stones!"

"However, we must watch the other branches closely. They've coveted my position for years. I believe the family's grand competition will erupt soon." The elder's face bore a cold expression, his gaze distant.

Seeing the elder's icy demeanor, the hall's occupants exchanged astonished glances. The elder was none other than Luo Tai, the current leader of the Ice Extreme Island.

It was Luo Tai's ruthless strength that had secured their branch's dominance, granting them the island's prime resources.

"As for this Luo Tian fellow," Luo Tai continued, "dispatch a few of our younger members to test him. If he shows potential, then..." His voice trailed off, but his eyes gleamed with cold intent.

"Yes," the elders replied in unison as Luo Tai's orders were carried out. The hall emptied, leaving only Luo Tai behind.

"Luo Xiong... I wonder if your deceased grandson possesses even a fraction of your brilliance," Luo Tai murmured, sighing before falling silent. His voice echoed through the empty hall.

...

Luo Tian remained unaware that his return had drawn the attention of the Luo family's current leadership. At this moment, his eyes blazed with intensity, sweat glistening on his brow as his formidable physique seemed to surge by threefold.

"Roar..." His overwhelming aura shook the entire room.

Meanwhile, Xu Liyi smiled as he held a pill—Luo Tian's gift of a Sixth-Rank Pill.

"You've advanced; I can't lag behind!" Xu Liyi mused, placing the pill in his mouth and beginning to refine it.

"Starving... so hungry..." Chen Zhanbiao sat idly in the courtyard, aware that his elder and Luo Tian were training. He dared not move freely, fearing interruption, so he remained to guard them, though his stomach growled loudly.

Primordial energy, imbued with icy coldness, surged into Luo Tian's body, causing him to open his eyes.

The upheaval of a Nascent Soul breakthrough was immense. As Luo Tian ascended, the dense primordial energy atop Ice Extreme Island's peaks was forcibly siphoned away—three-tenths of it vanished.

"Middle Nascent Soul... not enough! The pill's power remains; I shall push to the Late Nascent Soul stage!" Luo Tian murmured, clenching his fists. His gaze darkened as he stared at the sky.

With a flick of his hand, the lingering primordial energy above him coalesced into an actualized vortex, spiraling toward his body.

At the same time, he activated the Five Elements Primordial Energy Art to refine the volatile medicinal energy within him. His body, once calm, roared with renewed intensity.

As Luo Tian achieved the Middle Nascent Soul stage, every soul on Ice Extreme Island turned their gaze toward Luo Zhan's branch, pondering who had caused such a commotion.

"Good! Our branch finally has hope!" Luo Zhan laughed heartily in his room, tears of joy streaming down his face.

"Is it my younger brother?" A young woman sat atop an ice mountain, her expression puzzled before she vanished from sight.

"Who? It must be someone from Luo Zhan's branch! The commotion is so great—could it be Luo Qingqing has advanced again?" Another figure on a distant ice mountain mused, his expression skeptical. He resumed meditation, his body radiating power.

Chapter 534: Ice Dragon Roar

Chapter 534: Ice Dragon Roar

"Ugh... what's the point of advancing? You dared strike my father! Today, I'll let you taste the sting of being slapped!" Two figures with icy gazes approached Luo Tian's residence. They were Lu Wu and Lu Zhen, the sons of the two men Luo Tian had previously knocked out.

Both were prodigies within Luo Zhan's branch, second only to Luo Qingqing. They could not abide their father being humiliated by a boy before the family elders.

Their prowess was undeniable; they had surpassed even some of the Luo family's elders, having reached the Late Nascent Soul stage.

Not long after, they arrived at Luo Tian's courtyard and kicked open the door, only to find Chen Zhanbiao seated within.

"Starving... are you here to bring food?" Chen Zhanbiao, seeing them, his eyes glowed with hunger as he asked.

The two men were startled by Chen Zhanbiao's massive frame, their expressions filled with disbelief. They had never seen a human grow so robust.

"Bringing food?" The two men chuckled at Chen Zhanbiao's dazed expression.

"We're here to find Luo Tian! Let him come out!" Lu Zhen smiled as he addressed Chen Zhanbiao.

"Luo大哥 and my elder are training. Wait a moment! Why not find some food? We can eat while we wait!" Chen Zhanbiao spoke, his eyes filled with longing for sustenance.

Hearing this, the two men laughed again: "You move aside; we're here to fight him, not negotiate."

Chen Zhanbiao's brow furrowed as he asked: "So you're here to fight?"

"Er... yes!" Lu Zhen and Lu Wu found themselves liking the dazed youth, unwilling to harm a soulless Chen Zhanbiao. They explained gently.

"Then you're here to fight," Chen Zhanbiao said, refusing to let them in. He charged at Lu Zhen like a gorilla, throwing a punch.

Seeing Chen Zhanbiao's figure approaching, the two men smiled. To them, Chen Zhanbiao was merely a human—insignificant to two Late Nascent Soul masters. They scoffed at the idea of a "ant" daring to strike them.

Lu Zhen stood with arms crossed, waiting for Chen Zhanbiao's attack, even moving forward a few steps to meet him.

As Chen Zhanbiao's fist struck Lu Zhen's body, a sound of bones breaking echoed.

Lu Wu, who had been watching with amusement, gaped in disbelief, rubbing his eyes.

To his horror, Lu Zhen—already a Late Nascent Soul master—had been shattered by Chen Zhanbiao's single punch, blood spewing from his mouth. His expression of amusement had not yet faded when he was sent flying, colliding with the courtyard's gate.

"Damn it!" Lu Wu stared in shock, rushing to Lu Zhen's side to examine his injuries.

"Cough... it's fine..." Lu Zhen rose, his face a mix of emotions. Though for a Late Nascent Soul master, losing both arms was trivial—recovery would take mere moments—it was humiliating to be felled by a soulless human. Who would believe such a tale?

"You're not ordinary," Lu Wu's expression turned serious as he studied Chen Zhanbiao.

"Ugh... I'm so hungry, I lack the strength to fight. If I had energy, he wouldn't have moved!" Chen Zhanbiao looked disappointed, patting his now-empty stomach.

"Rest first; I'll deal with this monster!" Luo Tai stepped aside, his aura surging as he rushed toward Chen Zhanbiao.

Chen Zhanbiao saw Lu Wu approaching, clearly intending to fight. Yet due to his hunger, the usually battle-hungry Chen Zhanbiao lacked interest. But with Luo Tian and Xu Liyi's training behind him, he had no choice but to reluctantly charge at Lu Wu.

"Boom..." Chen Zhanbiao's fist met Lu Wu's, the collision sending both staggering back.

"Is this even human?" Lu Wu and Lu Zhen, recovering their arms, were stunned.

Chen Zhanbiao stepped back, his eyes burning with anger: "You're cheating! Dare to fight when I'm not hungry!" He roared, his voice like thunder in their ears.

"Damn it! I've met a monster! This is too troublesome!" Lu Wu turned to Lu Zhen. "Let's finish this quickly!"

"Right, end it swiftly!" Lu Zhen moved his hands, sending waves of pressure toward Chen Zhanbiao.

Instinctively, Chen Zhanbiao knew he could not let this youth's technique form—otherwise, he would suffer a major loss.

Thinking this, Chen Zhanbiao surged forward like a mountain, but Lu Wu blocked his path.

"Big guy, your opponent is me!" Lu Wu smiled and struck Chen Zhanbiao's body with a punch.

This punch carried primordial energy, its icy chill swirling around Lu Wu's fist.

Ice-type constitution—this was the reason most on Ice Extreme Island possessed it, granting them their strength.

"Boom..." Chen Zhanbiao countered with a punch, colliding with Lu Wu's.

Though Chen Zhanbiao did not fall behind, Lu Wu's obstruction allowed Lu Zhen's technique to form.

The cold chill made Chen Zhanbiao shiver, his expression turning serious as he gazed at the sky.

"Ice Dragon Roar!" Lu Zhen bellowed, his voice filled with anger as he unleashed his top-tier technique—Earth-Level Initial.

"Roar..." As Lu Zhen's words echoed, an ice dragon formed from the cold air, roaring above Luo Tian's courtyard.

Chapter 535: Same as Before

Chapter 535: Same as Before

The ice dragon circled above the courtyard, turning its warm spring-like atmosphere into a layer of frost. Chen Zhanbiao instinctively shivered, and his hunger only deepened after this chill.

Snowflakes drifted down from the courtyard's sky, and the ice dragon roared, locking onto Chen Zhanbiao before diving at him.

"Starving... if I were full, it would be better!" Chen Zhanbiao mumbled, patting his stomach as he waited for the ice dragon's attack.

At a hundred feet away, the dragon's aura surged toward Chen Zhanbiao.

"Done for... done for..." Chen Zhanbiao punched the ice dragon.

Though his physique was massive, he seemed like a tiny ant before the cold.

Seeing Chen Zhanbiao dare to resist, Lu Wu and Lu Zhen sneered.

"Let it disintegrate..." As they awaited the ice dragon's cold embrace, a cold voice echoed from Luo Tian's room.

"Crack..." The imposing ice dragon halted mid-air, emitting a crisp sound.

"Break it!" Chen Zhanbiao seized the opportunity, punching the ice dragon's body.

"Crack..." Under Chen Zhanbiao's punch, the now-powerless ice dragon cracked and shattered.

"Boom..." The fragments of ice and snow fell, carrying a chill that touched Chen Zhanbiao's body.

"Phew..." Chen Zhanbiao looked relieved, glancing at Luo Tian's room.

Lu Zhen and Lu Wu were also stunned, their gazes following Chen Zhanbiao to Luo Tian's room.

"Luo Tian Brother!" Chen Zhanbiao's face lit up with joy as he saw Luo Tian stepping out of the room, his gaze calm.

Luo Tian smiled and approached Chen Zhanbiao, placing a pill into his mouth. "Are you alright? Fill your stomach; I'll take you to a big meal later!"

After taking Luo Tian's pill, Chen Zhanbiao felt some strength return. The mention of a "big meal" made his eyes sparkle.

"You're looking for me?" Luo Tian's gaze was cold as he addressed Lu Wu and Lu Zhen. He secretly approved of the younger generation's strength—unlike the elders he had seen in the hall, these two bore fierce eyes.

"Indeed, we're here to reclaim our father's honor. Since you've emerged, come with me to apologize to him. This matter will be settled; otherwise, don't blame us for lacking kinship!" Lu Zhen spoke.

Lu Wu stood beside him, his expression filled with battle-readiness as he looked at Luo Tian.

"You're too weak!" Luo Tian shook his head, scrutinizing the two with a cold gaze.

"You're no more than a Late Nascent Soul, and even that just now! What's there to be arrogant about?" Lu Wu sneered but his eyes were wary.

Lu Wu sensed that the ice dragon's destruction was linked to Luo Tian, who had halted his famed technique.

"Hmph..." Luo Tian's figure moved like lightning, unwilling to waste words. He activated the Six Steps of Sealing Heaven and appeared before Lu Wu in an instant, raising his hand.

Luo Tian had once withstood a Late Nascent Soul while in the Early Nascent Soul stage. Now, having surged into the Late Nascent Soul with unstoppable momentum, his strength had surpassed ordinary Late Nascent Souls.

Though his punch seemed simple, it struck Lu Wu's face, sending him flying a hundred feet and breaking through several walls before stopping.

After defeating Lu Wu, Luo Tian did not pause. He activated the Six Steps of Sealing Heaven again and appeared before Lu Zhen.

"Return!" As Lu Zhen felt a chill, he struck out with his fist.

"No use!" Luo Tian sneered and swung his hand again, striking Lu Zhen's outstretched arm.

"Crack... Snap..." Two sharp sounds echoed as Lu Zhen's arm, like a branch, snapped under Luo Tian's palm. Yet it did not stop Luo Tian's hand, which landed a second slap on Lu Zhen's face.

"Boom..." Soon after, Lu Zhen's body fell onto Lu Wu, who had just risen.

"Cough..." The two men looked in disbelief. Both were Late Nascent Soul masters, yet they could not withstand a single slap from Luo Tian, who was also at the Late Nascent Soul stage. How变态 was this Luo Tian?

"Zhanbiao... bind them! Wait for your elder to return; he'll have ideas. His tricks are endless!" Luo Tian said, then unleashed a series of seals. Green flames erupted, flying toward the stunned men and entering their bodies through pores, swirling around their dantians.

"Ugh..." The two men were startled by the sudden flames, feeling that if they moved an inch downward, their cultivation would vanish. They dared not act rashly.

"Haha... no need to wait for me!" A wild laugh echoed in their ears, and the surrounding primordial energy surged again, shaking Ice Extreme Island's Luo family.

"Another breakthrough! Could Luo Zhan's branch be rising? Two people breaking through in a day!" People murmured, their gazes turning to Luo Zhan's branch.

In Ice Extreme Island's depths, a man sitting on an ice mountain opened his eyes again, frowning as he murmured: "Could it be that Luo Qingqing's branch has changed?"

"Middle Nascent Soul?" Luo Tian subtly sensed Xu Liyi's condition, smiling as he saw him exit the room.

"Wow... Luo Tian, how could you be stronger than me? You've reached the Late Nascent Soul! What did you eat? Give me a hundred or so to enter the Soul-Subjugation Stage!" Xu Liyi's face was full of disbelief, surprised that Luo Tian had truly advanced to the Late Nascent Soul.

"Big brother, they're bound!" Chen Zhanbiao smiled at Luo Tian, recalling what Luo Tian had said about waiting for his elder to return and then eating. He was overjoyed.

Chapter 536: Eating the Dragon

Chapter 536: Eating the Dragon

"Smack..." Seeing Chen Zhanbiao's eyes burning with hunger, staring at Luo Tian as if he hadn't noticed him, Luo Tian grew angry and smacked his head.

"Idiot... your elder has advanced! Are you not happy?" Xu Liyi shouted.

After being smacked, Chen Zhanbiao snapped back to reality and glanced at Xu Liyi before patting his head. "Congratulations, Big Brother! Luo Tian Brother, what are we eating later? Will it be enough to fill me?"

But Chen Zhanbiao only glanced at Xu Liyi before drooling over Luo Tian.

Seeing Chen Zhanbiao's unrefined behavior, Xu Liyi's nose nearly twisted. He turned to Lu Wu and Lu Zhen, his lips curling: "You two欺负 my brother?"

"No... no..." Lu Wu and Lu Zhen spoke softly, instinctively trembling.

But to their surprise, Xu Liyi approached them without attacking, instead crossing his arms and taking a deep breath. His voice thundered in their ears: "You bastard, what are you? You dare欺负 my brother... your ancestors..."

Lu Wu and Lu Zhen stared in shock at Xu Liyi's endless curses, their faces pale. If not for the seals preventing them from moving and the fact that they were bound, they would have fought Xu Liyi to the death. His curses were too harsh.

Luo Tian was speechless at Xu Liyi's display, unable to fathom how a seemingly cultured person could curse so... so eloquently.

"Luo Tian Brother, what are we eating? What?" Chen Zhanbiao seemed accustomed to this and looked at Luo Tian with a calm expression.

Hearing Chen Zhanbiao's words, Luo Tian's lips curled slightly as he said: "Today, I'll treat you to a good meal. We're eating dragons!"

Luo Tian waved his hand, and an icy chill filled their hearts. A hundred-foot-long water dragon appeared before them.

"Boom..." The massive dragon's body fell into Luo Tian's courtyard, instantly filling it with a sense of crowding.

The dragon's aura filled their hearts, leaving them stunned.

"Luo Tian Brother, can this be eaten? It's raw!" Chen Zhanbiao gently patted the cold dragon's body, asking with a foodie-like expression.

"This..." Xu Liyi, who had been cursing, stopped mid-sentence as the water dragon appeared. His face was filled with awe at its massive body.

Though the dragon was dead, its aura remained strong, leaving them in awe.

"Earth-Level Final Dragon?" Lu Zhen and Lu Wu were also stunned, staring at Luo Tian in disbelief. They hadn't expected him to possess even an Earth-Level Final dragon.

"Zhanbiao, how much can you eat?" Luo Tian smiled at Chen Zhanbiao.

"Haha... I really don't know!" Chen Zhanbiao smiled awkwardly, answering honestly.

"Did you dare eat this?" Lu Zhen and Lu Wu looked at Chen Zhanbiao as if he were a monster.

An Earth-Level Final dragon, intact and alive—though its essence was gone, the blood and flesh were still preserved. Such a meal could not be digested by ordinary people; even those at the Body-Subjugation or Bone-Melting stages would burst if they ate a single bite.

"Alright," Luo Tian sighed, retrieving an advanced high-grade sword and flashing golden light. He slashed at the dragon's tail.

"Boom..." The blade met the dragon's tail, sparks flying. But to their shock, the dragon remained unharmed, while the high-grade sword emitted a slight sound and its blade curved slightly.

"Hmph... even a dead Earth-Level Final dragon is not something a mere Nascent Soul can desecrate! You're a country bumpkin!" Lu Zhen sneered.

"Exactly, you really think you're something! In front of an Earth-Level Final dragon, what are Nascent Souls?" Lu Wu echoed.

Luo Tian ignored them and smiled as he approached the dragon, running his hand over its icy blue scales.

"Even a dead Earth-Level Final dragon... I don't believe I can't handle you!" He moved his hand, surrounding it with seven-colored primordial energy. He grabbed a palm-sized scale and tore it off.

The scale fell, revealing a block of white dragon meat before their eyes.

"Snort..." Lu Wu and Lu Zhen's faces were filled with disbelief, surprised that Luo Tian had such strength to tear off a dragon scale.

"I'll try too..." Chen Zhanbiao, clearly impatient, had just eaten Luo Tian's pill and regained some strength. He approached the dragon, gripping it with his massive hand and tearing off a scale.

"Alas..." Xu Liyi's face was filled with helplessness, joining the two to assist.

Lu Zhen and Lu Wu were completely stunned; they hadn't expected three people to be able to tear off an Earth-Level Final dragon's scale. After all, dragon scales protected the dragons' bodies and were naturally tough—yet they were rapidly disappearing under their hands.

Soon, the dragon's tail was completely stripped of scales, revealing its crystalline flesh.

Luo Tian raised his sword and unleashed all his strength, seven-colored primordial energy enveloping it. He slashed at the dragon's tail.

"Seven-Element Constitution!"

"My god, it's even more变态 than Luo Han's four-element one!" Lu Wu and Lu Zhen stared in shock at the seven-colored primordial energy.

"Pop..." The dragon, without its scales, could not withstand Luo Tian's full-force strike.

With a single slash, the dragon's tail fell off. Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao, who had been waiting nearby, grabbed it immediately.

"Haha... Brother Luo, can we start now? This is my first time eating such a thing!" Chen Zhanbiao drooled, his eyes burning with desire for the tail.

Xu Liyi was also excited; eating an Earth-Level Final dragon after so many years must be rare.

"Start roasting!" Luo Tian slashed again, dividing the dragon meat into pieces. At the same time, a series of high-grade long spears and halberds appeared in his hands.

Chapter 537: Luo Qingqing

Chapter 537: Luo Qingqing

After this, Luo Tian waved his hand, and a small cauldron the size of a palm flew from his hands. He closed the lid, and the cauldron gradually grew larger, landing on the ground with a heavy thud.

The dragon meat was arranged in rows atop the cauldron's mouth.

It seemed to sense what Luo Tian intended, as the cauldron emitted a series of discontented emotions into his mind.

"High-Level Earth-Grade Cauldron!"

"Roast dragon meat!" Lu Zhen and Lu Wu stared in shock at the bronze cauldron, surprised that Luo Tian was so extravagant. A High-Level Earth-Grade treasure had become a barbecue grill!

"Hiss..." Flames erupted from Luo Tian's hands, and he placed his palm on the fire hole. A thunderous sound echoed within the cauldron, and soon after, flames leapt onto the dragon meat.

But then, the dragon meat showed no change, still lying there as if unaffected by temperature.

"Hmph... dragons are not that simple!" Lu Wu sneered, looking at the still crystalline dragon meat.

"Troublesome," Luo Tian muttered internally and withdrew his hand from the fire hole.

"Give up! Haha, you're delusional!" Seeing Luo Tian withdraw his hand, the two men sneered, their mockery more evident.

But soon after, they were stunned again as the air's temperature suddenly surged. A green flame flew from Luo Tian's hands, directly landing in the cauldron.

Seeing this green flame, Lu Wu and Lu Zhen felt as if they had eaten a fly. Their dantians still held a green flame, and their expressions were speechless.

As the Blue-Glass Luminous Flame entered, the dragon meat could no longer resist and soon emitted a sizzling sound. The aroma filled the air, making Chen Zhanbiao drool.

Luo Tian flew into the sky, scattering a mist-like substance.

"Grass! He brought seasoning with him!" Xu Liyi widened his eyes, staring at Luo Tian in the sky.

An hour passed quickly. Under the terrifying temperature of the Blue-Glass Luminous Flame, the dragon meat was finally cooked, glowing with radiant light.

"Eat!" Luo Tian landed on the ground and told Chen Zhanbiao, who had been waiting impatiently.

"Roar..." Chen Zhanbiao howled in hunger, leaping high and grabbing a spear to bite into the oil-drenched dragon meat.

"Delicious!" Chen Zhanbiao said only one sentence before continuing to fight.

Luo Tian and Xu Liyi exchanged smiles, each taking a piece from the cauldron and eating.

"Uh?" As Luo Tian took one bite, his expression changed dramatically, filled with disbelief.

The dragon meat had just entered his stomach when he felt a pure primordial energy radiating with a cold chill into his dantian.

"Indeed, an Earth-Level Final dragon! One bite is almost equivalent to three days of cultivation!" Luo Tian was internally delighted, looking at Xu Liyi.

Xu Liyi's face also showed joy as he looked at Luo Tian, exchanging a glance before continuing to eat.

Not that they wanted to talk; they needed time to refine the terrifying essence within the dragon meat.

"Grass, they actually ate it!" Lu Zhen and Lu Wu's faces were filled with disbelief as they watched Luo Tian and the others.

Luo Tian and Xu Liyi were fine, eating slowly, but Chen Zhanbiao had redefined their perception of humans.

Chen Zhanbiao seemed unaffected by the terrifying blood and flesh essence within the dragon meat, swallowing it bite after bite. His mouth was oily, and he had already finished one piece and grabbed the second.

"Say, if we ate a single piece, would it make us reach the Late Nascent Soul?" Lu Wu's eyes were filled with longing as he looked at the dragon meat on the cauldron.

"It should," Lu Zhen replied, his gaze filled with admiration.

"Whoosh..." A sound of breaking air echoed as a blue figure appeared above Luo Tian's courtyard, his face puzzled as he looked at the dragon's body still remaining.

When Luo Tian and Xu Liyi sensed someone in the sky, they put down their half-eaten dragon meat, frowning slightly as they looked up.

"You're Luo Tian?" The blue-cloaked woman asked, her face puzzled as she looked at Luo Tian.

"Yes," Luo Tian answered, already suspecting who the woman was.

"You little brat, you've finally survived!" The blue-cloaked woman smiled with relief and flew toward Luo Tian, grabbing him to examine him closely.

"Qingqing Sister?" Luo Tian smiled gently, bowing slightly.

"You little brat, you scared me to death!" Luo Qingqing hugged Luo Tian tightly, tears streaming down her cheeks.

Luo Qingqing had been old enough to remember when she saw her young brother die, crying desperately. Later, it was her grandfather who told her Luo Tian would return, and she gradually recovered.

Now, decades had passed, and Luo Qingqing had become a young woman, indicating she had entered the Nascent Soul stage in her twenties.
