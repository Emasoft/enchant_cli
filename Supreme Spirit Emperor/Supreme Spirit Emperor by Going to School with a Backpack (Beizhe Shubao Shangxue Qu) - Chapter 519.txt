“Go!” Luo Tian sighed softly, extending his hand to push. A seven-colored flame lotus emerged from his palm, slowly drifting toward the storm of blade qi that filled the sky.

The next moment, people trembled with terror. That tiny seven-colored flame lotus—wherever it passed, the void shattered as if yielding to its path.

“Destroy Heaven and Earth!” At that moment, people’s minds could only grasp those four words. No other adjectives existed.

This was the life-saving relic left by the sparrow before its departure—a mark, a flame lotus’s imprint. As long as Luo Tian filled the fire of Xiao Qi into this mark and compressed it to its peak, he could unleash it. Yet the power’s extent remained unknown to him.

In an instant, the small seven-colored flame lotus reached the massive storm of blade qi conjured by Guan Hongseng.

Boom! Boom! Boom...

Thunderous roars echoed across heaven and earth. The tiny lotus stood no match for the colossal storm of blade qi, yet each gust of sword energy disintegrated before it, dissolving into waves that spiraled outward. The air grew scorching with heat.

“Sizzling…!” As the blade qi disintegrated, it fell into the blood-red幻天海 (Huan Tian Sea), and the sea’s waters violently vaporized.

Within ten breaths, thousands of blade qi vanished entirely. Smoke rose, and the Huan Tian Sea roiled like boiling water, its surface visibly descending. All felt the tremors of this cataclysmic force.

“Apocalypse Crimson Lotus! That’s the bird’s doing!” A seed hovered, shouting in fear.

“Still, the lotus remains!” People gasped, watching the seven-colored flame lotus suspended in mist, flying toward Guan Hongseng.

“Damn it!” Guan Hongseng roared, his voice laced with madness. A deathly crisis surged within him, echoing the day he faced the ultimate immortal tribulation on Luantian Mountain.

“Come… come… come!” Guan Hongseng bellowed skyward, his robes flaring. As he spoke, the three zombies locked in battle with Zang Yunfei and others abruptly broke free from combat, flying toward Guan Hongseng.

“Buzz…” At the same time, the seven-colored flame lotus imprinted itself upon the three zombies. Yet it pierced through them instantly, leaving hollow blossoms on their bodies. The three massive zombies crumbled to ash, falling from the sky.

“What power is this? Those were True Immortals at their peak!” All instinctively shivered, gazing at the relentless lotus. Their eyes reflected terror—especially those who had once aimed to ambush Luo Tian, realizing even they were insufficient for this seven-colored lotus’s wrath.

“Ah…!” Guan Hongseng roared, his demonic sword swelling. His body’s immortal energy surged into the blade.

The seven-colored lotus collided with the sword, but though its power was immense, it had been obstructed repeatedly. Its might diminished significantly, yet it still shook the heavens.

The swelling demonic sword was gradually eroded by the lotus, even as Guan Hongseng emptied his immortal energy. Still, he could not halt it.

“Boom…” The lotus finally shattered the sword and struck Guan Hongseng’s body. His form was hurled backward, the seven-colored mark seared into his chest. A pungent scent of charred flesh filled the air.

“Finally over!” All sighed deeply, their chests heaving. The lotus had pressed upon them with such unbearable pressure it felt like the end of the world.

As the oppressive force faded, the heavens began to mend slowly. The realm fell silent. Those who had halted their attacks under its weight stared in shock.

“Our宗主 (Master) is dead!” All disciples wore expressions of terror, stunned that so many had fallen so easily.

“This time, you won’t escape!” Luo Tian panted, surprised by the lotus’s might. His estimation of Longque’s strength rose further.

Luo Tian coldly spoke, the Rending Sky Spear returning to his grasp. He leapt into motion, charging toward Guan Hongseng, who had been severely wounded.

“Damn it!” Guan Hongseng’s eyes flashed madness. That blow had nearly taken him to the brink of death, draining all his immortal energy and leaving his body battered. His condition was at its worst.

“Demon Seeds!” Guan Hongseng bellowed, snatching one of the ten demon seeds he had sealed within his ship.

Chapter 1993: He Knows the Mind-Seed Demon Art

Ten demon seeds hovered around Guan Hongseng. Without hesitation, he seized one and swallowed it. Black energy gradually thickened around his body.

“Buzz…” As Guan Hongseng swallowed the seed, the golden Rending Sky Spear thundered downward, striking him fiercely.

“Boom…” Guan Hongseng grinned wickedly, meeting the spear with his bare hands.

The scene froze—Guan Hongseng’s palm bled, and Luo Tian’s expression shifted slightly as he gazed at him.

“Die!” Guan Hongseng kicked forward, aiming at Luo Tian. Though wounded, Luo Tian was no better; his immortal energy barely sustained flight. That spear had been wielded by sheer physical strength.

Luo Tian was struck in the chest, flying backward. He even dropped the spear but grabbed one of Guan Hongseng’s demon seeds.

“Plop…” Luo Tian was kicked into the Huan Tian Sea, sending waves crashing.

“Luo Tian!” Zang Yunfei and others roared, wanting to aid him. But their prior battle with the three zombies had drained them completely, leaving them powerless.

“Puh…” Luo Tian returned swiftly, drenched and wild-eyed.

“You think only you can devour demon seeds?” Luo Tian coldly spoke, clutching the seed and swallowing it.

“Boom…” Instantly, Luo Tian’s aura surged again. Black energy swirled around him as he charged toward Guan Hongseng.

“Today, you must die!” Guan Hongseng roared, inhaling the remaining seeds toward himself.

“I’ll inhale too!” Luo Tian’s eyes turned crimson, inhaling desperately. He had no choice; if Guan Hongseng devoured all the seeds, he’d have no path to survival. He gritted his teeth and fought for them.

In an instant, the ten seeds were divided—Guan Hongseng seized six, Luo Tian four.

They clashed repeatedly with their bodies alone, simultaneously refining the seeds within them.

Fortuitously, Guan Hongseng’s relentless combat did not hinder Luo Tian from refining the seeds. He knew Luo Tian could evade his attempts, as before.

He didn’t realize that if he had stopped Luo Tian, it would have caused him great trouble.

“Boom…!” Their bodies clashed endlessly, thunderous sounds echoing within them. Luo Tian’s withered golden-black immortal pill began to swell again, black immortal energy flooding it.

“Crack…” A fissure rose from the pill, elevating Luo Tian’s strength to a new level.

Second crack… Third crack…

Time passed slowly, nine fissures appearing on the pill—signifying Luo Tian’s strength had surged to a half-True Immortal level, and it showed no signs of stopping.

On the other hand, Guan Hongseng recovered swiftly as well, his cultivation restoring and growing rapidly.

Their attacks grew heavier, their bodies wreathed in black energy, resembling two demonic kings clashing.

Both knew their strength wasn’t genuine but stemmed from the ten demon seeds. If they had focused on refining them normally, these seeds would have become their strength. Yet now, neither wished to grant the other an opportunity; whoever delayed would pay a heavy price.

“Boom…” Finally, four seeds were exhausted. Luo Tian’s aura stabilized at the early True Immortal stage.

“Mind-Seed Demon Art—truly a heaven-defying technique! It shouldn’t exist in this world!” People marveled, gazing at Luo Tian’s overwhelming aura.

“Previously, that boy was at the peak of Heavenly Immortal—already terrifying. Now, briefly entering the early True Immortal stage, how变态 (abnormal) must he be?” Yet their eyes gleamed with anticipation, treating Luo Tian as an equal.

“True Immortal Mid-stage!” However, people noticed Guan Hongseng had briefly reached the mid-stage as well, drawing gasps.

“I don’t believe you can still summon that lotus! Now without that sparrow, what do you have to fight me with?” Guan Hongseng punched Luo Tian away, standing atop the sky. He gazed at Luo Tian before stepping into the void toward him.

“I still have four supreme immortal artifacts!” Luo Tian roared, unleashing the Eighteen Thunder Techniques. The Bow of Shooting the Sun materialized in his grasp, its spear resting upon it.

“Battle阵列 (Array) of the Invincible!” Seven massive characters thundered downward, radiating overwhelming might. Each character could fully annihilate a True Immortal Early-stage.

“Trivial tricks! If the calligraphy immortal himself at the early True Immortal stage performed it, I’d be wary. But you’re just an ant in my eyes!” Guan Hongseng coldly spoke, his fists flashing. Seven resounding booms echoed before him.

“Crack…” A streak of light shot across the sky toward Guan Hongseng.

“Can you fire how many arrows?” A sense of crisis surged within Guan Hongseng. Though his voice was dismissive, his eyes were grave.

“Puh…” Yet in the next moment, Guan Hongseng widened his eyes. A golden spear pierced his shoulder, creating a blood hole that drained his life force.

“Cough… cough…” Guan Hongseng’s face paled, his gaze filled with disbelief as the Rending Sky Spear returned to Luo Tian’s grasp, stained with blood.

“How is this possible!” Guan Hongseng’s face paled. If he hadn’t evaded at the last moment, the spear would have pierced his heart.

“The end is decided! Luo Tian previously used the Bow of Shooting the Sun and that spear to kill even True Immortal Peak. This Guan Hongseng, though equally terrifying, has no counter to the Bow of Shooting the Sun. He’s sentenced!” People marveled, their voices filled with awe.

Luo Tian had given them an immense surprise, surpassing even their understanding of Heavenly Immortal Peak. Though some relied on external forces, it was ultimately Luo Tian’s skill.

“Let’s see how many arrows he can fire!” People gazed at Luo Tian, who once again drew the bow. The Rending Sky Spear vanished from his grasp.

“Puh…” A copper mirror shattered before Guan Hongseng, blood spewing from his body. This arrow pierced his abdomen, leaving him pale.

“Hmph… managing to survive two arrows—impressive!” People murmured, watching Guan Hongseng’s pale face.

“This arrow will end you!” Luo Tian spoke softly, and as two arrows were fired, his cultivation returned to Heavenly Immortal Peak.

As he spoke, the third arrow was shot forth. The Rending Sky Spear appeared before Guan Hongseng, brimming with Luo Tian’s intense killing intent.

“Flee!” Guan Hongseng roared, but the final arrow was unstoppable. He swung a black sword toward the spear, then turned and fled into the Huan Tian Sea.

“Crack… crack…” The Rending Sky Spear shattered the sword, pursuing Guan Hongseng.

Guan Hongseng’s speed reached its peak. From afar, he left afterimages, vanishing into the depths of the Huan Tian Sea.

“Pursue!” Zang Yunfei, Sima Xiu, and three others regained some strength, leaping into the sky toward Guan Hongseng.

Guan Hongseng was a major threat; they knew he couldn’t be left alive. If he escaped this time, he might stir up chaos again.

“Damn it…” Guan Hongseng roared repeatedly, sensing the Rending Sky Spear drawing closer. He pushed his strength beyond limits, surpassing most True Immortal Mid-stage beings—but still couldn’t escape the spear.

“Old Ancestor, bring back his corpse!” Luo Tian shouted at Zang Yunfei and the others. The Chronology Book was still in Guan Hongseng’s grasp; Luo Tian needed it back.

As he spoke, Luo Tian soared toward the sky, joining the crowd of Shenglong Sect disciples. He gazed at Zang Yunfei’s disappearing figures.

“Don’t you all surrender?” Luo Tian addressed the remaining disciples still clashing with soul fragments and ghosts, his voice authoritative.

At this moment, these disciples were dazed. Their initial confidence had vanished after their sect’s master was taken by Guan Hongseng and drowned in the Huan Tian Sea. They died absurdly.

Then Guan Hongseng was shot away by Luo Tian’s three arrows, leaving them leaderless. Their prior battle with soul fragments and ghosts had cost them heavily; now they were at a loss.

“Kill!” Shenglong Sect disciples roared, regaining some strength after time. Their eyes turned cold as they stared at the other sect disciples, radiating iron-blooded resolve that made the opposing sects feel immense pressure.

Though they outnumbered Shenglong Sect disciples slightly, they felt no match for them—perhaps not even enough to withstand one wave of attack.

“I surrender!” A crowd dropped their weapons, shouting.

“I surrender too!” One voice initiated a chain reaction; all lowered their arms and stood in the sky.

“Stop!” Luo Tian spoke softly, pointing his finger. The soul fragments and ghosts halted, then growled before vanishing into the Huan Tian Sea.

“Master, go to the Hall of Ancestors and lift the restrictions. Eliminate all disciples from the Blood Dragon Sect!” Luo Tian coldly ordered Li Changfeng and others. He was too exhausted to do much else.

“Good!” Li Changfeng and the others flew up, casting restrictions into the other sect disciples’ bodies. The Blood Dragon Sect’s disciples were mercilessly killed by them.

“This time, he must have reached his limit!” People gazed at Luo Tian, pale-faced and standing among Shenglong Sect disciples.

“This kid is truly heaven-defying!”

“He knows the Mind-Seed Demon Art—this evil method must not be allowed to live!” Huang Tiande roared, his voice laced with coldness.

Hearing Huang Tiande’s words, all eyes turned toward Luo Tian standing among the crowd.

Chapter 1994: Limitations

“Indeed!” Hearing Huang Tiande’s words, all paused slightly. Their gazes turned toward Luo Tian, eyes cold as they spoke.

Mind-Seed Demon Art—every sect in the immortal realm desired it. This technique allowed one’s cultivation to surge rapidly, reaching its peak. The Mind-Seed Demon Master had once caused chaos across the immortal realm with it, making it a forbidden art. Yet everyone yearned to touch this taboo, as it was too tempting.

Ninety-plus sects erupted in chaos. Most shouted to kill Luo Tian, while only a few remained silent. Some sects were allied with Xinghe Fu, and others were successful contenders in the struggle for supremacy.

“Kill him! If left alive, he’ll become a祸害 (menace) in the immortal realm!” Huang Tiande and five others shouted loudest, their gazes fierce toward Luo Tian.

Yet despite their loud cries, no one spoke up. Before, Ye Wudao had protected Luo Tian; they were waiting to test Ye Wudao’s limits, unwilling to be the first to offend Xinghe Fu.

“Why…” Li Changfeng and others, after casting restrictions on the surrendering disciples, saw the loud cries of the middle three realms’ sect leaders.

“Protect the Young Master!” Shenglong Sect disciples looked grim but still shielded Luo Tian. No matter what, after the Struggle for Supremacy, Luo Tian was their Young Master—no one could replace him.

“Who wants to kill me? Step forward!” Luo Tian coldly spoke, stepping out again. His gaze held mockery as he stared at the middle three realms’ sect leaders shouting.

“Buzz…” As people shouted, golden light flashed. The blood-stained Rending Sky Spear sliced through the sky, returning to Luo Tian’s grasp.

“Is he dead?” Luo Tian muttered softly, a hint of joy in his eyes. The spear had sent feedback—Luo Tian knew Guan Hongseng was dead.

“Does he still have strength? He was at his limit!” All gazed at the blood-stained spear, trembling. This weapon had slain many strong beings, especially the True Immortal Peak elder of Guiguan Sect and Guan Hongseng.

As people marveled, Zang Yunfei and three others returned pale-faced, their bodies stained with blood. Guan Hongseng’s desperate struggle had cost them dearly.

“This is Guan Hongseng’s head!” Zang Yunfei waved his hand, revealing a blood-red head.

Sima Xiu also tossed a storage pouch to Luo Tian’s front, which made him smile. He could clearly sense the Chronology Book within it.

“Kill Luo Tian! Eliminate this immortal realm’s menace!” Huang Tiande and five others shouted again, snapping people back to reality. Their gazes turned toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian stared at the middle three realms’ people, memorizing their faces. If anyone dared to act, he’d make them regret it—especially now that the Chronology Book had returned. His confidence was greater than ever.

“Luo Tian, commit suicide! If you defy execution, Shenglong Sect will perish!” Huang Tiande roared, his voice laced with triumph.

“You might kill a few of us, but can you destroy them all? If one of us dies, do you think Shenglong Sect will survive? Our sects behind us will eradicate Shenglong Sect without mercy!” Huang Tiande sneered, gazing at Luo Tian.

Hearing Huang Tiande’s words, Luo Tian’s gaze darkened further. Yet he slowly lowered the Bow of Shooting the Sun, gazing at Huang Tiande and the determined Shenglong Sect disciples.

Though Huang Tiande’s words made sense, Luo Tian wasn’t afraid. But if he clashed with these middle three realms’ sects, Shenglong Sect would be destroyed.

These people from the middle three realms were all influential figures in their sects. If Luo Tian killed them, it would be an eternal enmity—Shenglong Sect couldn’t afford that.

“Young Master, we don’t fear!” Shenglong Sect disciples roared. Without Luo Tian, they might have already been killed by Guiguan Sect.

“Kid, you are my Shenglong Sect’s Young Master—forever!” Zang Yunfei and three others smiled.

“Wait, if a fight breaks out, you should escape. You still have hope in Shenglong Sect!” Sima Xiu and Peng Tiande transmitted mentally.

Luo Tian had done enough in this war, even surpassing them three. They would never abandon Luo Tian.

“Shenglong Sect disciples, form the Giant God Array!” Zuo Qiu Ming roared, his figure towering. His gaze was resolute.

“Yes!” Disciples flew up, and in an instant, two giants thousands of zhang tall stood. Their aura surged skyward.

“Everyone, stop!” Luo Tian spoke, causing all to pause slightly, their gazes confused.

“Young Master!” Within the array, Shenglong Sect disciples gazed at Luo Tian. As long as he spoke, they would charge toward the middle three realms’ people—no matter how quickly they were crushed.

“I, Luo Tian, today renounce Shenglong Sect and am no longer its Young Master. According to the Struggle for Supremacy rules, the middle three realms’ sects cannot attack Shenglong Sect!” Luo Tian spoke softly, stepping to the front. His face was pale as he gazed at the middle three realms’ people.

“Luo Tian!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Zang Yunfei and three others’ faces changed abruptly. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to say this.

Luo Tian was attempting to shoulder all the middle three realms’ wrath alone. As he said, if Luo Tian left Shenglong Sect, the middle three realms’ sects would break the nine immortal mountains’ rules by attacking Shenglong Sect.

“Everyone, don’t speak. I’ve already caused your relatives to die. You mustn’t lose more lives! The Young Master of Shenglong Sect is now Zuo Qiu Ming. He’s more suitable than me!” Luo Tian addressed Shenglong Sect disciples.

“Luo Tian!” Zuo Qiu Ming stood there, gazing at Luo Tian. He hadn’t forgotten Luo Tian’s words before.

“Kid, I’ll accompany you!” Xue Changshan felt a surge of guilt. He had secretly ordered people to attack Luo Tian before.

“Xue Elder, I said I hope Shenglong Sect won’t lose more lives!” Luo Tian shook his head.

“Three elders, speak! Expel me from the sect!” Luo Tian again addressed Zang Yunfei and three others.

“You…” Zang Yunfei and three others couldn’t speak, gazing at Luo Tian. They knew he was doing this for Shenglong Sect’s sake, but they couldn’t say it.

“Buzz…” The Rending Sky Spear glowed coldly, resting on Luo Tian’s throat. His eyes smiled.

“Speak! Don’t worry; no one in this world can kill me but myself!” Luo Tian chuckled softly, gazing at Zang Yunfei.

“Good!” Zang Yunfei nodded, then gritted his teeth and spoke word by word.

“Luo Tian, from now on, you are no longer my Shenglong Sect’s Young Master. Disciple Luo Tian is expelled from Shenglong Sect. Zuo Qiu Ming is my Shenglong Sect’s Young Master, the next sect leader!” Zang Yunfei spoke as if drained of strength.

“Hail the Young Master!” A low voice murmured, then a thunderous roar echoed across heaven and earth. All Shenglong Sect disciples bowed respectfully to the ground.

“Alright, now I’m alone. Who wants to kill me? Come on!” Luo Tian nodded, gazing at the middle three realms’ people. He held the Rending Sky Spear, with a yin fish hovering above his head.

Luo Tian knew their reasons for wanting to kill him were numerous—Mind-Seed Demon Art was one. His previous display of strength, if he grew further, would be a threat to all sects.

“We wouldn’t dare threaten like this if we were top sects of the middle three realms!” Zang Yunfei and three others gazed at Luo Tian alone facing the middle three realms’ people. Their hearts burned with fire.

Not just them, all Shenglong Sect disciples glared with fury. They knew Luo Tian had made this choice to protect them.

“Father, help speak up! If you don’t say anything, I’ll also renounce the sect!” Ye Liangchen shouted at Ye Wudao.

“I know what to do. Don’t speak!”

“Also, don’t cause trouble!” Ye Wudao slapped Ye Liangchen’s head, addressing him and the others who were eager to act.

“Master, protect Luo Tian! We’re from the same village!” Man Hun addressed the War God Sect’s sect leader.

“Master, at this critical moment, please protect Luo Tian. He shouldn’t die like this!” Jin Xiyang also addressed the Jin Yang Sect’s sect leader.

“Let’s see… he has angered everyone. Just one sect can’t protect him!” The two sect leaders responded to Jin Xiyang and Man Hun.

“I don’t believe you still have strength. Everyone, wait and see if I eliminate the middle three realms!” A purple figure rushed toward Luo Tian—Chang Ziyang’s elder, Chang Qingshan.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian raised the Bow of Shooting the Sun, drawing an arrow and aiming at Chang Qingshan. His gaze held mockery.

“Crack…” The Rending Sky Spear became a streak of light, vanishing from Luo Tian’s grasp. A scream echoed in the sky, shaking people’s hearts.

“Old man, living so long and still not learning to hold back?” Luo Tian sighed deeply. His body was slightly withered, gazing at Chang Qingshan’s pierced throat, convulsing.

“Sss…” A gasp of shock echoed among the middle three realms’ crowd, their faces filled with disbelief as they gazed at Luo Tian standing there.

“He consumed his life force to fire this arrow!” People gasped, surprised Luo Tian could still draw the Bow of Shooting the Sun.

“Everyone, attack him!” Huang Tiande shouted in the crowd, but no one responded.

Huang Tiande shouted again, yet no one moved. Who wanted to be the next Chang Qingshan? Even though Luo Tian seemed near death, he had still killed Chang Qingshan.

Chapter 1995: You Talk Too Much

Huang Tiande gazed around, no one moving. His face showed embarrassment as he looked at the crowd’s gazes—those eyes meant, “Why don’t you go?”

“One man against nearly a hundred sects—Luo Tian is the first to do so!” Zang Yunfei and others gazed with admiration.

If these people truly didn’t dare to act, Luo Tian might have a chance at survival.

“I don’t believe you can still draw it!” Huang Tiande’s eyes struggled, gazing at Luo Tian who barely held the bow. He gritted his teeth and rushed out of the crowd toward Luo Tian.

“Die!” Huang Tiande flew, summoning a mountain that crashed toward Luo Tian.

But as Huang Tiande moved, Ye Wudao also did. He transformed into a streak of light, surpassing Huang Tiande and descending like a meteor onto the mountain he had summoned.

“Crack…” The golden mountain thundered and shattered, releasing a surge of immortal energy that swept outward.

“Just you talk too much!” Ye Wudao sneered, taking a step forward and instantly appearing before Huang Tiande. He slapped him.

“Smack!” Huang Tiande’s body came fast and went fast, emitting a crackling sound. He was hurled back, spitting blood uncontrollably.

“True Immortal Peak!” The middle three realms’ sect leaders gasped, gazing at Ye Wudao standing there.

“Did you take my words as nonsense? I said I’d protect this kid, and I did. You still dare to act?” Ye Wudao roared, his voice laced with霸气 (might). His gaze swept over the crowd.

“Buzz…” At the same time, a ghostly figure appeared beside Luo Tian who had lowered the Bow of Shooting the Sun. Cold eyes gazed at him.

“You’re good!” Ye Tian spoke, then grabbed Luo Tian and returned to Xinghe Fu’s crowd.

“Hmph… Third Uncle, you’ve praised someone twice!” Ye Liangchen smiled, watching Ye Tian return Luo Tian.

“Ye Wudao has reached True Immortal Peak!” People marveled, gazing at Ye Wudao standing there without speaking.

“Ye Wudao, he’s practiced the Mind-Seed Demon Art. You still protect him?” Huang Tiande, battered and standing up, gazed at Ye Wudao.

“Kid, swear not to use the Mind-Seed Demon Art on innocent people!” Ye Wudao smiled coldly, addressing Luo Tian.

“I swear: if I use the Mind-Seed Demon Art on innocent people, may heaven and earth destroy me!” Luo Tian quickly spoke. He knew Ye Wudao was protecting him.

“Is that enough?” Ye Wudao chuckled softly, gazing at the middle three realms’ people.

“Not enough!” Huang Tiande roared, knowing the middle three realms’ people still wanted Luo Tian dead. Yet no one had spoken up.

“Wudao, this kid is truly worth killing!” The middle three realms’ people also spoke, but their tones were gentler.

“If that’s the case, he is my Xinghe Fu disciple!” Ye Wudao sneered, then addressed Luo Tian.

“Kid, now you have no sect. Will you join me as my义子 (adoptive son), becoming one of Xinghe Fu’s three Dao Sons?” Ye Wudao’s voice echoed across heaven and earth, leaving everyone stunned.

No one expected Ye Wudao to protect Luo Tian by adopting him as his son. This proved how determined Ye Wudao was to protect Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly, but he glanced at Nan Gong Yuching and others. Then, kneeling on one knee: “Father, accept my bow!”

Luo Tian had no choice. Though he had reserves, if he fought to the end, Nan Gong Yuching and others would also fight to the end. If conflict arose, they’d surely die.

Also, Ye Wudao was Ye Liangchen’s father. Though Ye Liangchen was a spoiled brat, he had been warm toward Luo Tian. Calling him “Tian” repeatedly, Ye Wudao’s support was genuine. This gratitude made Luo Tian worthy of this bow.

“Luo Tian!” Nan Gong Yuching and others gazed in shock, watching Luo Tian kneeling on one knee. Today was the most he had ever knelt before them.

“Good, good, good!” Ye Wudao laughed heartily, extending his hand to lift Luo Tian. He highly valued Luo Tian.

He believed his son’s judgment was sound. He also knew Ye Liangchen’s character—though Ye Liangchen had joked before, if Luo Tian clashed with the middle three realms’ people, he’d definitely charge forward.

Ye Wudao also valued Luo Tian’s character—willing to face the middle three realms alone, protecting Shenglong Sect. His integrity was beyond question. Whether in strength or character, Luo Tian was top-tier.

“Is that enough? Do you still want to kill him?”

“From today, Luo Tian is my adopted son, one of Xinghe Fu’s three Dao Sons. Whoever dares to attack him will face my wrath!” Ye Wudao spoke again, his gaze colder.

“Master of Xinghe Fu, this is somewhat inappropriate!” Huang Tiande spoke, his eyes filled with intense resentment.

“Huang Tiede!” Ye Wudao roared, his voice like thunder, shaking everyone’s heads. Killing intent surged in Ye Wudao’s eyes.

“Plop…” Blood flashed, and Ye Tian appeared like a ghost beside Huang Tiande. A bloodied dagger sliced his throat, spilling blood. Huang Tiande’s eyes widened in disbelief.

“Ugh… ugh…” Huang Tiande gurgled, but no words came out. He collapsed to the ground with a thud.

“Huang Elder!” The sect leader of Huangshan Sect shouted, gazing at the fallen Huang Tiande.

“Previously, I gave him chances to talk endlessly. I ignored him. He didn’t know his limits!” Ye Wudao spoke softly.

“Master of Xinghe Fu, this kid killed my Ziyu Sect elder. His death is forgivable, but his punishment is unavoidable! We don’t demand much—just have him return our bow, and we’ll let it go!” A middle-aged man in purple robes stepped forward, speaking loudly.

“Oh? Not to be punished?”

“You previously attacked my Xinghe Fu’s three Dao Sons. I haven’t confronted you yet. Now, you’re asking for compensation?”

“If I don’t want to compensate?” Ye Wudao gazed at the man, his voice playful.

Hearing Ye Wudao’s words, people’s mouths twitched. They felt he was somewhat shameless but said nothing—no one dared argue with a madman.

“We are small sects, Xinghe Fu is large. But everyone knows Master of Xinghe Fu Ye Wudao is reasonable. Your actions are somewhat ungracious.”

“We aren’t your match, so we can’t control you. But someone else can,” the man said, his voice solemn.

“Correct! I Huangshan Sect will also report this to the Nine Immortal Mountains!” The Huangshan Sect leader also spoke loudly.

Hearing their words, people’s hearts tightened. They all knew Xinghe Fu was a family of madmen but secretly mocked their naivety.

“Since you said that, it’s not good to leave no reply. One month later, Xinghe Fu will fully declare war on Ziyu Sect—no mercy!” Ye Wudao spoke coldly, gazing at the two men.

“Use this month to prepare well,” Ye Wudao said, his gaze at the two men. “One month later, Xinghe Fu disciples will hunt your sects relentlessly. You’d better not come out; kill one, and I’ll kill ten!”

“Is this reply satisfactory?” Ye Wudao chuckled softly, gazing at the two men.

“Master of Xinghe Fu, this is a misunderstanding. I didn’t mean it like that. Huang Youshan’s pursuit of your adopted son was deserved. I’ll personally exterminate his clan to vent your anger!” The two men’s faces changed drastically. They dared not confront Xinghe Fu directly.

“I’ll do the same!” The Ziyu Sect leader also quickly affirmed, this matter was no small thing. Everyone knew Ye Wudao was a madman and might truly do it.

“No interest!” Ye Wudao shook his head, then gazed at other sects with a deep gaze—those who dared to provoke him would face his wrath.
