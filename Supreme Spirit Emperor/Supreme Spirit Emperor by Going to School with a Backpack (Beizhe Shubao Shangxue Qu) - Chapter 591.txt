Luo Tian felt that a vast scheme was targeting Xinghe Mansion, with Shenglong Sect merely a part of it. He himself was now entangled in the scheme, and there was no way to extricate himself.

Chapter 2241: The Beginning()

In the grand hall, Luo Tian and others sat there. Ye Liangchen's face bore a joyous expression as he gazed at Luo Tian and the others, repeatedly toasting them. As time passed, the gathering grew lively. Ye Liangchen set down his cup and spoke softly: "Senior Brother, do you think Feishen Sect intends to destroy Shenglong Sect?"

"How did I not know this? I've never received any news about it!" Ye Liangchen's face bore an innocent expression as he gazed at Luo Tian, knowing they might have misunderstood.

"Senior Brother, my eldest uncle has encountered some issues recently. Therefore, my father and uncle have been preoccupied with his affairs. Thus..." Ye Liangchen's expression slightly changed, sensing that the situation might have exceeded his expectations. Though they were preoccupied with Ye Sheng's matters, the fact that Shenglong Sect was under siege and they knew nothing about it suggested that someone had secretly suppressed the news. To suppress such vital information and deceive Xinghe Mansion's Lord Ye Wudao, the person must hold a high position within Xinghe Mansion.

"Encountered issues?" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly. Though he had not been in Xinghe Mansion for long, he knew its strength was formidable but divided into many branches. Ye Liangchen's branch relied on Ye Sheng, an Immortal King. If Ye Sheng encountered any issues, it might indeed shake Ye Liangchen's branch.

"It's all over now," Luo Tian lightly shook his head. "Ye Liangchen and the others are not in good shape either."

"Senior Brother, these days Xinghe Mansion seems tranquil but is actually chaotic. I feel something big will happen!"

"My eldest uncle's situation stems from his cultivation method; every century, he enters a month-long period of weakness. Therefore, my father and uncle, along with Chen Ge, have been by his side constantly."

"This matter is known only to the four of us. Senior Brother, please don't spread it!" Ye Liangchen transmitted his thoughts to Luo Tian, as the matter was too critical. He could only convey it mentally.

"Rest assured; nothing will happen!" Luo Tian softly comforted him. Though Ye Liangchen appeared decadent, this was all an act. He was meticulous and had hidden his strength, a fact Luo Tian knew well.

"Additionally, many city lords under Xinghe Mansion have arrived here recently. Clearly, someone has ordered them to come!" Ye Liangchen sighed deeply.

"Indeed, we received news that Xinghe Mansion was in trouble and your name was mentioned!"

"Moreover, the four sects must have known what would happen. That's why they dared to attack Shenglong Sect. Perhaps only you and your group are unaware of this!" Nan Gong Yuqing's brows furrowed.

"Power struggles—seems your Ye family's other branches are vying for control!" Luo Tian let out a light laugh. Considering Ye Fu and others' attempts to kill Ye Liangchen and Ye Chen, it was clear other branches had grown impatient.

"Damn! My eldest uncle is currently in his period of weakness. If something happens, we'll be in grave danger!" Ye Liangchen's face darkened.

"Endure. Once my eldest uncle passes through his weakness, he can subdue everything!" Ye Liangchen realized the key point.

"Right now, those people haven't revealed their true colors. It seems they are also wary of your eldest uncle!"

"So, never let others know about my eldest uncle's weakness. If they do, it might erupt instantly!" Luo Tian transmitted his thoughts to Ye Liangchen.

"Let's observe the situation. Secretly gather your branch's forces!" Luo Tian continued transmitting, his gaze fixed on Ye Liangchen.

"Luotian!" As they conversed, a figure entered. His eyes carried complex emotions but his aura was no less than those in the hall.

"Ye Chen, it's been a while!" Luo Tian smiled at Ye Chen and met his gaze.

Ye Chen had matured after his journey through Hell, losing his former sharpness and becoming more composed.

"Rubbish. We just met recently..." Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Ye Chen inwardly cursed, recalling the days in Hell.

"Since you've returned, stay put. Xinghe Mansion is chaotic these days!"

"Liangchen, let's go. There's something to do!" Ye Chen addressed Ye Liangchen and cast a deep glance at Luo Tian before leaving the hall with him.

"Luotian, what do we do?" Nan Gong Yuqing asked, sensing the unusual nature of the situation.

"Stay put. Don't forget, I am Ye Wudao's adopted son. Our current position owes much to his support. Ye Liangchen is my brother; he searched for me in Hell for eight years. If they have issues, I can't ignore them!" Luo Tian spoke softly and stepped out of the hall. As Xinghe Mansion's Daozi, Luo Tian naturally had his own residence, large enough to accommodate them all without issue.

Days passed like this. Luo Tian remained low-key, visiting Ye Wudao twice in between and returning with a furrowed brow. No one knew what he was thinking.

On the seventh day of their stay in Xinghe Mansion, a major event finally occurred.

"City Lord of Xinglong presents himself to Lord Ye Wudao with urgent matters!"

"City Lord of Youyun reports to Lord Ye Wudao with significant news!"

Numerous figures gathered outside Ye Wudao's courtyard, shouting loudly. In a dim room, a thin figure lay motionless, his life force barely perceptible, resembling a withered stone. His body was rigid.

Four figures stood by the bed—Ye Wudao, Ye Tian, Ye Liangchen, and Ye Chen. The one lying there was Ye Sheng, the pillar of their branch, an Immortal King. Yet his current state was poor.

"I'll see who dares to step forward!" Ye Wudao's face darkened, his gaze profound. He led Ye Liangchen and Ye Tian out of the room. As they left, only Ye Sheng remained in the room, his body beginning to twist and vanish into thin air.

Luo Tian and others stood among the crowd, recognizing many old acquaintances—Qiu Qian Di, Ye Die, and some unassuming figures like Ye Hong. Several elders radiated powerful auras, their eyes filled with mockery as they gazed at Ye Wudao's courtyard. These were the elders from other branches of the Ye family.

Thousands of powerful figures stood there, representing thousands of city lords. Each lord controlled a city, illustrating Xinghe Mansion's immense power.

"Comparable to the strength of Tian Gui Wang City!" Luo Tian mused, comparing Xinghe Mansion's might to Hell's Eight Heavenly Kings.

"In Hell, the strong survive. The laws are cruel, hence more powerful individuals."

"However, the Xian realm has more people than Hell but fewer true masters. Yet, Hell possesses infinite ghosts; if a conflict arose, Hell would likely prevail over the Xian realm!" Luo Tian mused, sensing Hell would not remain peaceful.

"Watch the show. See what these elders can do!" Luo Tian crossed his arms, observing the elders.

"Luotian!" Someone noticed him. Though much time had passed, Luo Tian's image of being unbeatable at his level, even defeating Qiu Qian Di, remained vivid.

"Then let's deal with him as well!" Several elders sneered internally, their gazes disdainful yet excited.

"Ye Sheng's branch will be erased from Xinghe Mansion today!" The elders felt a strange tension at the thought.

Under people's expectant gazes, Ye Wudao and his group emerged. Ye Wudao's face was dark as he appeared before the crowd.

"What's going on?" Ye Wudao spoke coldly, his aura overwhelming. The elders and city lords immediately calmed.

"Who sent you to Xinghe Mansion?" Seeing the crowd quieten, Ye Wudao sneered and addressed the city lords like they were clowns. Behind him, Ye Tian radiated a cold killing intent. After years of cultivation, Ye Tian had reached the threshold of an Immortal King, his killing aura more intense.

Two glares from them made everyone shudder, even the elders.

"Did you send them here?"

"Speak up. What's your business?" Ye Wudao sneered, taking a seat.

"Lord, we have doubts about Ye Liangchen as Daozi!" A city lord of the late-stage True Immortal stepped forward, immediately drawing everyone's attention to Ye Liangchen. The man was Pan Yuexing, Lord of Youyun City, possessing late-stage True Immortal strength sufficient to control a large city.

"I too... I too..." As the man spoke, others echoed with anger.

"Recently, Ye Liangchen visited my Youyun City and acted recklessly. I didn't say anything since he was Xinghe Mansion's Daozi, but Ye Liangchen acted recklessly and stole my concubine and daughter. I demand an explanation from Lord Ye!"

"Yes, Lord Ye! Ye Liangchen visited my Xinglong City and caused a massacre..." Voices rose, each accusing Ye Liangchen of monstrous deeds.

"What's that to me?" Ye Liangchen shouted, his decadence having limits. These people were clearly slandering him.

"Interesting!" Luo Tian smiled, watching the city lords' performance. It was truly well-acted.

"This is just the beginning!" The elders sneered internally, watching the city lords' lamentations and gazing at Ye Wudao.

Chapter 2242: Challenging Ye Liangchen

Ye Wudao listened to the city lords' accounts, his face dark. He knew Ye Liangchen well; since returning from Hell's Gate of Death, Ye Liangchen had remained by his side in Xinghe Mansion without leaving. He naturally knew these people were fabricating excuses.

Ye Wudao did not intervene but listened to their accounts, scanning the elders. He wanted to see how many would stir trouble.

As Ye Wudao was Xinghe Mansion's Lord, he understood the branches' thoughts. Over the years, he had learned much about the elders but hadn't fully grasped them yet.

The city lords spoke for half an hour before turning their gazes to Ye Wudao.

"Have you finished?" Ye Wudao smiled lightly, tapping the chair's arm. His gaze swept over the city lords.

"Finished! Lord, this matter must be addressed. Don't let Ye Liangchen's status as your son shield him. I suggest removing his Daozi title, stripping his cultivation, and appointing another!" A city lord spoke, but upon seeing Ye Wudao's cold gaze, his voice grew quieter.

"Understood. Nothing more—go back. I have other matters!" Ye Wudao smiled lightly, answering briefly.

"This..." The city lords were at a loss for words, gazing at Ye Wudao.

"Brilliant! Truly brilliant!" Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuqing praised Ye Wudao's handling. A few words had silenced the city lords.

The elders also furrowed their brows, expecting Ye Wudao to lash out in anger. They had prepared arguments but instead found him dismissing them with a few words, leaving the city lords speechless.

This left the elders and city lords feeling like they had struck a sponge—no leverage to apply.

"Lord, this matter is being brushed aside too easily. Isn't that inappropriate?" One elder finally stood up and addressed Ye Wudao.

"Ye Xiao?" Ye Wudao instantly recognized the elder, his expression neutral. This Ye Xiao was one of those he knew, an elder from Ye Sheng's era with True Immortal peak strength.

"What do you suggest, Elder Ye Xiao?" Ye Wudao smiled lightly, directing his gaze to Ye Xiao.

"Ye Liangchen has been Daozi for years. We elders have seen his actions—his strength is poor, and his character worse. Now he's committed these people-against crimes. This isn't trivial!"

"But Ye Liangchen is your son, the blood of your branch. I suggest removing his Daozi title, stripping his cultivation, and imprisoning him for a century to punish him slightly!" Ye Xiao spoke calmly.

"Ugh, these old men are clearly restless. I estimate they'll lose badly this time!" Nan Gong Yuqing muttered.

They had been concerned before, but now it seemed Ye Wudao was prepared. Who would win in the end?

"Master, what's your intention?" Ye Xiao shouted, gazing at Ye Tian. They had chosen to reveal their true colors, so they must have their reasons.

"Nothing in particular. Just preventing some villains from escaping!" Ye Tian chuckled, his smile chilling. He then stood behind Ye Wudao.

"Lord, since the younger generation has grown, perhaps it's time to decide the next Lord. Also, since Ye Liangchen is no longer Daozi, shouldn't another be chosen?" Another elder, also of True Immortal peak strength, stood up.

"Agreed!"

"But let them challenge Ye Liangchen. Whoever defeats him shall become Daozi. As for the next Lord, we'll decide after selecting the final Daozi!" Ye Wudao smiled lightly and addressed everyone.

"What?" The crowd's faces showed disbelief. They didn't know what Ye Wudao was up to. Everyone knew Ye Liangchen's nature.

"Father, is this to expose those people's chosen Daozi?" Luo Tian immediately understood, crossing his arms and watching the spectacle.

When the Star Pool opened, one of those people's chosen Daozi had emerged but vanished. That was Ye Wudao's main goal—to eliminate them all.

"Indeed, the Lord is wise. Since the Lord spoke, we naturally dare not disobey!" Ye Xiao spoke softly, though he knew Ye Wudao would not easily concede.

"It's time to unveil that piece of the puzzle. If it becomes Lord, it would save us much trouble!" Ye Xiao exchanged thoughts with other elders.

Everyone felt today's Ye Wudao was different from their usual image. In the past, they had no right to speak; today, they could say anything.

"This is clearly a compromise, a concession!" Several elders murmured, confirming the truth of their information and feeling reassured.

"Ye Liangchen shall face challenges. Whoever defeats Ye Liangchen shall be one of Xinghe's three Daozi!" Ye Wudao announced loudly.

Ye Liangchen maintained his arrogant demeanor, gazing at Qiu Qian Di and others—those who could threaten him.

"Let's go to the Starry Terrace!" Ye Wudao spoke, flying into the air toward Xinghe Mansion's contest area.

"What if this kid can do it? I've never seen him fight!" Diao Dezhu and others gazed at Ye Liangchen standing there.

"Rest assured. A father knows his son best; it's fine. Besides, Ye Liangchen isn't someone to be trifled with. Have you ever seen him lose?" Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Ye Liangchen.

As Ye Wudao rose, others followed. The city lords naturally trailed behind, each with their own thoughts, flying to a high platform where over a thousand stood without crowding.

"Who dares challenge me!" Ye Liangchen stepped forward, shouting at the crowd with anger.

"Qiu Qian Di wishes to test!" As Ye Liangchen's words barely finished, Qiu Qian Di stepped out of the crowd, his gaze filled with amusement.

"What's going on?" Ye Liangchen and Qiu Qian Di's words immediately drew the crowd's curiosity, rushing toward the Starry Terrace.

"Lord Ye Wudao! Elders!"

"Why so many city lords? We noticed some had arrived before, but upon counting, it's not few!" Disciples murmured, unsure of the situation.

"Ye Liangchen Daozi versus Qiu Qian Di?" Soon, people saw Ye Liangchen and Qiu Qian Di standing at the terrace's center, surrounded by people.

"This is absurd. Ye Liangchen has some strength, but who is Qiu Qian Di? No one in Xinghe Mansion can control him except Ye Chen and Luo Tian!" The crowd murmured.

"Challenging Daozi? Why? Ye Liangchen is already good enough!" One disciple recalled, "I was bullied before; Ye Liangchen stood up for me!"

"Though Ye Liangchen is a bit unconventional, he's genuinely good to us!" Disciples understood the situation and became angry.

"Strongly seizing your concubine, stealing your daughter—do you think yourself a person? Our Ye Liangchen is who he is; even if your daughter rushed to him, our Daozi wouldn't glance at her!" Disciples cursed the city lords.

"Begin!" As disciples stirred, Ye Wudao announced the start of their battle.

"Nine Heavens' Moon!" As Ye Wudao's words barely finished, Qiu Qian Di moved. His first move was formidable.

A jade moon hovered above his head, and Qiu Qian Di had once stayed in Buxian City. He knew Ye Liangchen was not as simple as he appeared, otherwise he wouldn't have stayed there for eight years. Ye Liangchen remained calm, watching Qiu Qian Di charge toward him and waving his hand, sending out a series of seals.

"Ten... thousand... ten thousand..." In an instant, the sky seemed to rain with seals, transforming into powerful martial arts that crashed toward Qiu Qian Di.

"This is the seal purchased in Buxian City!" Ye Die trembled, gazing at the seals exploding.

"Damn! Where did this kid get so many seals? So many high-level ones. I've never seen this before!" Everyone's faces bore disbelief, except Luo Tian, who smiled and pitied Qiu Qian Di. Such a number of explosions would overwhelm even Luo Tian, and though Qiu Qian Di was strong, he'd have to be cautious against these seals.

Chapter 2243: The True Ye Liangchen

As the barrier formed, a series of thunderous sounds echoed constantly. The wild energy surged against the barrier.

The chaotic atmosphere enveloped the barrier, and the deafening explosion echoed even through it. Luo Tian and others bore pity as they gazed at the expanding barrier.

After half an hour of thundering, the energy calmed. The scene within the barrier revealed Ye Liangchen standing arrogantly, and beside him was a figure charred black, unrecognizable. Yet everyone knew it was Qiu Qian Di.

"Is this Qiu Qian Di? He didn't look like this when he dueled with Luo Tian and Ye Chen!" Disciples murmured.

If it were usual times, Xinghe Mansion's disciples would have cursed the person who injured Qiu Qian Di. But this time, no one spoke because it was Ye Liangchen. Ye Liangchen's unconventional nature had deeply rooted in the disciples' minds; if he won, any method was acceptable.

"Defeating Qiu Qian Di means no one can be Daozi!" Disciples gazed at Ye Liangchen.

Ye Liangchen was protective of his people in Xinghe Mansion, so he had high popularity.

"Cough... cough..." Qiu Qian Di stood up, his body charred black. He spat out two clots of black smoke and slowly returned to Ye Die's side.

"Useless!" Elders muttered internally. Losing to Luo Tian was one thing, but now losing to Ye Liangchen was another.

Yet with so many seals, even these True Immortal peak elders couldn't remain unscathed. They could only grumble internally.

"Who else?" Ye Liangchen shouted, his gaze sweeping over the crowd.

"Think you defeated Qiu Qian Di and it's all over?" Ye Xiao's eyes held disdain. Qiu Qian Di was merely a pawn in their plan.

"No one else?" Ye Liangchen shouted, but no one stepped forward. He smiled and walked toward Ye Wudao.

However, as Ye Liangchen took a step, a figure appeared before him, smiling.

Dressed in rough cloth, looking ragged and ordinary, his appearance was平淡.

"Ye Hong wishes to challenge!" A calm voice echoed. His black eyes flashed with cold light, gazing at Ye Liangchen standing there.

"Ye Hong?"

"Don't be ridiculous. Can he beat Daozi Ye Liangchen?" Seeing Ye Hong step forward, Xinghe Mansion's disciples scoffed.

Ye Hong was a bastard son in Xinghe Mansion, despised and long bullied. Though Ye Liangchen was not well-regarded, he was the Daozi and Ye Wudao's son. Rooted in righteousness.

"This person is desperate for recognition!" Everyone shouted, their voices filled with disdain.

"Unusual," Luo Tian stood there, his eyes slightly narrowing. He sensed a familiar aura on Ye Hong.

"Is it him?" Ye Wudao and Ye Tian also gazed at Ye Hong, their eyes flickering with thought.

"Hidden well. We didn't expect this unassuming Ye Hong to be the one they cultivated as a Daozi candidate!"

"Perhaps it was him who dueled Luo Tian in the Star Pool with a mask!" Ye Wudao mused internally.

Ye Liangchen was initially stunned but soon felt a threat from Ye Hong, his expression slightly shaken.

"Are you the one they cultivated as Daozi?"

"You didn't recognize me? I remember, I once stood up for you when you were bullied!" Ye Hong spoke softly, scrutinizing Ye Hong.

"Indeed. So I won't kill you this time! I just want the Daozi position!" Ye Hong gazed at Ye Liangchen, his voice filled with excitement.

"I've waited for this day a long time!" Ye Hong sighed, then waved his hand. A golden brush appeared in his grasp.

"Buzz..." On the other side, Ye Hong waved his hand. Golden light flashed as seals flew from his grasp. He began to draw rapidly, leaving trails of afterimages.

A seal shot toward Ye Liangchen, causing people's faces to show shock.

In an instant, nearly a hundred seals flew out. The weakest was middle-stage Immortal Seal, their speed unbelievable.

"Too fast! I've never seen anyone draw seals this quickly!" Disciples exclaimed, gazing at Ye Hong drawing rapidly.

"Strange familiarity. I remember! It was Ye Hong who dueled Luo Tian in the Star Pool!" Some disciples recalled, their faces filled with disbelief as they gazed at Ye Hong.

"He's been patient. His talent shouldn't have been bullied, but he remained patient. Even in the Star Pool, he didn't reveal his true face!" Xinghe Mansion's disciples gazed at Ye Hong drawing seals, admiration in their eyes.

"Earlier you blew people up so nicely. Now taste the feeling of being hit by thousands of seals!" Ye Hong smiled, his speed increasing.

Thunderous sounds echoed again, but this time it was reversed.

"Always I've been the one to blast people. This is the first time someone dares to do this to me!" Ye Liangchen shouted, waving his hand. Seals flew from his grasp.

"Does he have more?" Seeing Ye Liangchen unleash seals, people gasped in disbelief.

"But Ye Liangchen's seals aren't many either!" Luo Tian mused, but he wasn't worried. After all, the ten billion battle merits weren't for ordinary people; Ye Liangchen had taken many of the items.

Boom, boom, boom...

Both continuously unleashed seals. Each seal transformed into martial arts, colliding in people's sight.

Time passed. After an hour, Ye Liangchen unleashed nearly ten thousand seals and finally ran out. Ye Hong's face showed a slight smile.

"Enough. I won't toy with you anymore!" Ye Liangchen shook his head, then formed hand signs. A series of glowing lights flew from his hands and hovered above his head.

"So many immortals..." Disciples' faces showed shock again, gazing at the immortals hovering above Ye Liangchen's head. Some were even top-grade immortal weapons.

"How rich is this kid?" Ye Tian's face bore shock. Top-grade immortals—he only had two, but Ye Liangchen had several.

"Explosive..." As people were shocked, Ye Liangchen's cold voice broke their awe.

"Boom...!"

The sky cracked, winds reversed. Thousands of immortal weapons exploded, forming a terrifying storm that rushed toward Ye Hong's seals.

"Open!" Ye Hong's face changed, his speed increasing. He unleashed thousands of seals, which exploded and formed a storm that surged forward. Thunder clashed; the two storms fought for half an hour before vanishing from sight.

"What else do you have?" After the dust settled, Ye Hong panted heavily. He gazed at Ye Liangchen, who also panted heavily. Both had expended much.

"Many more skills, but I won't use them!" Ye Liangchen smiled, gazing at Ye Hong. He waved his hand, and a green long sword appeared in his grasp. The blade seemed light, as if composed of starlight, but its surrounding space twisted.

As Ye Liangchen gripped the sword, his aura changed dramatically. A towering霸气 emerged from him.

"This is Star Sword, Lord Ye Wudao's personal sword. He gifted it to Daozi Ye Liangchen!" People gasped, recognizing the blade in Ye Liangchen's hand.

"Interesting. You've also been hiding!" Ye Hong's brows furrowed slightly, his gaze turning serious. He stepped on the ground and flew toward Ye Liangchen.

"Indeed, I've been waiting for you to appear!" Ye Liangchen sneered and slashed. The sky darkened.

"Buzz..." The heavens trembled. A beam of light shot down from the dark sky, forming a massive blade that slashed toward Ye Hong. Ye Hong's body froze. His golden brush expanded and swung to meet Ye Liangchen's blade.

"Crack..." A thunderous sound echoed within the barrier. Both Ye Liangchen and Ye Hong retreated, their eyes filled with seriousness.

"Good skill. Try again!" Ye Hong smiled and flew upward. Ye Liangchen, undeterred, continuously slashed with the Star Sword, clashing with the golden brush. They fought in people's awe.

"Is Daozi Ye Liangchen really this strong?"

"If Ye Hong was the masked man in the Star Pool, and Ye Liangchen could match him, even slightly overpowering him, it shows Ye Liangchen's strength is formidable!"

"The masked man once made Luo Tian look awkward!" Xinghe Mansion's disciples stirred, watching Ye Liangchen transform into a different person.

"Daozi Ye Liangchen isn't a decadent person. He's truly an outstanding talent!" Xinghe Mansion's disciples became excited.

"Damn! Hiding so deep. We were all deceived!" Ye Xiao and other elders muttered internally but showed no emotion.

"Both men have been patient for years, enduring bullying. One feigned decadence while the other hid his strength. Both are outstanding talents!" Nan Gong Yuqing and others sighed.

Not only others, but even Luo Tian, who had prepared for it, was startled by Ye Liangchen's transformation. At this moment, every slash carried terrifying power. Even Luo Tian would have to be cautious.

Chapter 2244: Slaying Ye Hong

On the Starry Terrace, two figures continuously clashed. The green Star Sword in Ye Liangchen's grasp constantly flickered. Each slash caused Ye Hong to spit blood and retreat.

Ye Wudao and Ye Tian's faces bore satisfaction as they watched Ye Liangchen's fearless performance. This was his first display of full strength, which had stunned everyone and shattered the image of Ye Liangchen as a decadent person.

They clashed for nearly a hundred rounds, both wounded and battered.

"Crack..." The collision sound echoed. Both Ye Liangchen and Ye Hong retreated, spitting blood. Ye Liangchen's Star Sword shattered in his hand but instantly reformed.

"Phantom Stars!" Ye Liangchen roared, gripping the sword. The green blade slashed through the black sky. The dark heavens shimmered with stars, which began to move and emit light toward Ye Liangchen's Star Sword.

"Grudge Dance!" Ye Hong also roared, his golden brush dancing. The black sky twisted, a crimson hand with cold aura emerged from the vortex, similar to Luo Tian's Infernal Ghost Claws. However, this crimson hand was human-like, formed from blood. It grabbed the golden brush.

At the same time, the brush transformed into a crimson hue. The blood hand waved, drawing with the crimson brush.

Next moment, a crimson mountain was drawn by the blood hand. It was lifelike but radiated terrifying power, rushing toward Ye Liangchen's blade.

"Boom..." The thunderous sound shook the eight directions. The Starry Terrace trembled as both martial arts clashed, and the barrier also shook.

"This Ye Hong's technique is sinister!"

"It's a blood hand born from resentment!" Ye Tian gazed at the crimson hand, his voice heavy.

"Resentment. Alone, he couldn't produce such a blood hand. Clearly, Ye Hong has killed many people. Their deaths must have been cruel to generate resentment!" Ye Tian spoke softly, gazing at Ye Hong's blood-covered body.

"Unexpectedly, our Xinghe Mansion has had disciples die. I didn't expect a traitor among us!" Ye Wudao sneered, his eyes flashing with killing intent. Yet he had no evidence.

"I think those city lords didn't falsely accuse Ye Liangchen!" Luo Tian muttered, gazing at the city lords. He could still see anger in their eyes.

"Nan Gong, did you say that the one who reported to your place was Ye Liangchen?" Luo Tian asked Nan Gong Yuqing.

"Indeed. According to our subordinates, it was Ye Liangchen. However, he left after reporting and didn't stay long." Nan Gong Yuqing replied. He had known something was off.

"It must have been a fake. The city lords' experiences might be real, but the prime suspect is this Ye Hong who seemed invisible before!" Luo Tian's gaze held suspicion.
