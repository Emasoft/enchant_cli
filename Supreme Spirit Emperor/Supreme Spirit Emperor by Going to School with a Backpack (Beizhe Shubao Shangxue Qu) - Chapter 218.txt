“Don’t be reckless!” Lu Hantian yanked Xu Liziye back. Though the Demon Domain had two captives in their grasp, they remained overwhelmingly powerful—far superior to their side.

“Haha, kid. Still want revenge? That’s deserved! Offending the Eight Sacred Clans of the Demon Domain, what are you? Daring to swear blood vengeance? You’re not even worthy. If it were outside, you’d have been crushed already!” Hu Chengyang sneered at Xu Liziye and the others.

“Smack… What the hell do you think you are, daring to represent the Eight Sacred Clans?” Diao Dedu’s face was icy as he glared at the group, his speed so sharp he slapped Hu Chengyang across the face.

“Diao… De… Tu…” Hu Chengyang gritted his teeth, eyes burning with hatred at Diao Dedu, wishing to devour him.

Yet Hu Chengyang dared not retaliate. Diao Dedu was no pushover; he feared retaliation from Diao Dedu more than the wrath of Lu Hantian’s group.

“Give back our two disciples!” A disciple of the Demon Domain, a novice Sage, coldly glared at Lu Hantian’s group.

“Not giving it back! What can you do?” Long Jie finally snapped, stepping forward with a chilling voice. Though he didn’t unleash the Dragon Ancestor’s aura, his piercing gaze made the Demon Domain members tremble instinctively.

“Who are you, kid?” The凤族 (Feng Clan) novice Sage’s face bore deep suspicion as he stared at Long Jie.

“Who I am doesn’t matter. What matters is that you’ve offended me, my brother, and my friends—there’s no reason for you to exist!” Long Jie coldly replied, a domineering aura radiating from him.

“Arrogant! I’ll teach you a lesson today, though I can’t kill you. Beating you half-dead is acceptable!” The Feng Clan’s novice Sage elder flashed toward Long Jie.

“You dare! If you touch him, my grandfather will eradicate your Feng Clan!” Diao Dedu stepped in front of Long Jie, issuing a threat.

“Within this ancient temple, who do you think you’re threatening?” The Feng Clan elder sneered, unimpressed by Diao Dedu’s threat. His speed was near-instant.

“Dong…” Just as the Feng Clan elder spoke, a deep bell sound echoed through the grand hall, halting him. His gaze lifted to the sky.

“The Era Bell has rung!” As the bell’s sound rang out, all turned their eyes skyward, eager to know who had struck the first bell.

“It’s Luo Tian!” Long Jie and his group wore smiles, gazing at the figure beside the massive Era Bell.

Feng Jiutian’s face darkened as he watched Luo Tian, who was just five zhang (a traditional Chinese unit) away from touching the Era Bell.

“Worthless! All of you are worthless!” Feng Jiutian seethed internally. He hadn’t expected to be intercepted twice, yet Luo Tian had still reached the Era Bell first.

Five zhang—Feng Jiutian had believed himself destined to be the first to strike the Era Bell, basking in the spotlight. He was confident that with thirty more breaths, he could cross those five zhang.

But as his confidence soared, Luo Tian—flung by Chen Zhanbiao—sliced past him. Though slight in frame, Luo Tian’s body collided forcefully with the Era Bell.

Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes. The collision had pulled him from his “oneness with heaven and man” state, leaving a brief haze. He soon realized he stood before the Era Bell, his eyes flickering with amusement.

Yet as his gaze fell upon Chen Zhanbiao—his body weakened to the brink, scarred and battered—especially as his aura continued to wane, Luo Tian’s eyes turned cold. His killing intent was unhidden as he scanned Feng Jiutian, then Sun Feiwen and Zhou Wei, and finally Nan Gong Feibai.

Chapter 965: You Go First ( )

In the grand hall, beside the massive Era Bell, Luo Tian’s eyes were icy as he gazed at Feng Jiutian and others still striving to reach the Era Bell. His aura radiated death.

“Who did it?” Luo Tian’s low voice sent shivers through the group.

Feng Jiutian’s face darkened, standing just five zhang away from Luo Tian. He could feel the tyrannical aura radiating from Luo Tian, though his cultivation was still at the threshold of Sage. Yet he exuded an aura that made Feng Jiutian’s heart tremble.

Feng Jiutian clenched his teeth, eyes flashing with battle intent. Previously, he had deemed himself no match for Luo Tian at Sage level. But now, with Luo Tian’s cultivation reduced to the threshold of Sage, Feng Jiutian was a prodigy who had fought against novice Sages. If he feared now, his mindset would shatter, hindering future cultivation.

Yet Feng Jiutian didn’t rashly approach the Era Bell. The bell was paramount.

As Luo Tian’s words echoed, Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen caught up with Feng Jiutian. Their bodies shimmered with golden light, yet they dared not advance. Luo Tian’s aura was too intimidating—any step forward would invite a storm of attacks.

Luo Tian remained calm, standing before the Era Bell’s body, waiting for Nan Gong Feibai and Zhou Wei to arrive.

Under Luo Tian’s chilling gaze, Nan Gong Feibai and Zhou Wei stood before Feng Jiutian and others.

“Nine regions’ top prodigies! Such a scene is rare!” Those on the ground watched the figures in the sky, who could be called the pinnacle of nine regions’ youth.

“Is a prodigy battle about to erupt?” People were thrilled, eager for such a clash.

“Who did it?” Luo Tian stood calmly beside the Era Bell’s body, his face calm with a hint of amusement. His words seemed casual, yet they struck deep into the hearts of the group. Except for Sun Mengru, Feng Jiutian and others grew solemn.

At that moment, Luo Tian was like a sword sheathed—sharp and deadly. Once drawn, his strike would be fatal.

“I did it! What’s your problem, Luo Tian? You’re now at the threshold of Sage. I don’t see what’s so arrogant about you!” Feng Jiutian finally stepped forward, his eyes burning with battle intent. He held a crimson long sword.

“Hmph. Indeed, the Eight Sacred Clans still bully a Nine Source Supreme Emperor. That’s quite a feat for the Eight Sacred Clans!” Luo Tian sneered, his gaze fixed on Feng Jiutian.

“Still, your courage is commendable. You go first; I have matters to attend to!” Luo Tian addressed Sun Mengru and others, then moved away from the Era Bell, believing avenging Chen Zhanbiao was more important than the bell.

“Once struck, it cannot be stopped. To stop is to forfeit!” As Luo Tian summoned his spear and approached Feng Jiutian, a voice echoed through the grand hall. Luo Tian halted, his expression dark.

“暂且饶你一命!” Luo Tian’s cold face touched the massive Era Bell. This was a chance Chen Zhanbiao had given with his life; Luo Tian would not abandon it.

“Harnessing cultivation power to strike the Era Bell?” Luo Tian muttered, his dantian (cultivation core) roaring. Golden light surged as he unleashed his power, striking the Era Bell with full force.

“Dong…” A heavy sound echoed through the hall. The resounding bell rang, shaking people’s ears.

An invisible wave struck their minds, leaving them pale. Especially those nearby felt the terrifying aura, their faces changing with greed.

“This is a pseudo-Era Treasure. Luo Tian’s initial strike already made my blood tremble!” Zhou Wei marveled, gazing at the golden Era Bell, its runes flowing like declaring its might.

Sun Mengru and others were also stunned. They watched the golden Era Bell, its runes flowing with power.

Yet Luo Tian was shaken. When he used his cultivation to strike the Era Bell, he unleashed half his power. But the bell’s counterattack surged instantly, striking his dantian and causing it to churn with holy power.

Luo Tian’s face broke into cold sweat. This was clearly a rebound of his own cultivation, striking the most vital part—his dantian.

“Something’s wrong!” Luo Tian frowned, not rushing to strike again. He carefully observed his dantian, sensing a change.

“Dantian… expanded!” After careful analysis, Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with light. A smile spread across his face.

The self-destruction power had not only reduced Luo Tian’s cultivation but also shrunk his dantian from an ocean to a lake. Yet after the Era Bell’s feedback, it had slightly expanded. Though not obvious, Luo Tian noticed it through careful meditation.

“Unsurpassed! This Era Treasure has such effects!” Luo Tian’s face lit with joy. Once his dantian returned to ocean size, he could recover to novice Sage level.

“Once back to novice Sage, these people are like chickens and dogs!” Luo Tian’s eyes swept over the group, including the novice Sages on the ground.

“What benefit does striking the first Era Bell bring?” The group’s minds puzzled, watching Luo Tian’s unhidden joy. Their eyes turned to the intricate runes of the Era Bell.

“Again!” Luo Tian laughed, unleashing all his cultivation power into a golden hammer. His anticipation surged as he smashed it against the Era Bell.

“Dong…” The heavy bell sound echoed again, a wave of destruction spreading from the Era Bell. It surged into Luo Tian’s dantian.

“Crack…” A crackling sound echoed as Luo Tian’s dantian emitted a series of cracks. Blood trickled from his lips, his face flushed with an unusual redness.

Feng Jiutian and others saw Luo Tian clearly wounded, their faces puzzled. They didn’t understand why Luo Tian was so desperate—this bell’s sound was far stronger than the first.

“Braving injury to strike! What opportunity is this!” Sun Feiwen’s eyes gleamed, watching Luo Tian’s body again radiating holy light.

“Third strike!” People silently counted the number of times Luo Tian struck the bell, unsure how many he could manage.

Luo Tian laughed again. Though wounded, he felt his dantian had expanded slightly.

“Again!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with endless light. His cultivation power transformed into a massive hammer, smashing against the golden bell.

“Dong… Dong…” The heavy bell sounds kept ringing. Fourth, fifth—each strike sent terrifying waves into Luo Tian’s dantian.

Luo Tian spat blood, his face pale to the extreme. His dantian felt like it could explode at any moment, yet his eyes grew more resolute.

“Joy and pain!” Luo Tian wiped the blood from his lips, having struck seven times. His dantian was now riddled with cracks, its size restored to that of a novice Sage. Golden holy power surged against the nearly shattered dantian, causing Luo Tian excruciating pain.

Yet he was also elated. A decision formed in his mind: “Wealth and risk go hand in hand. This Era Bell may not belong to me, but after this, I’ll never have another chance to expand my dantian. If I can expand it further—to the size of a novice Sage—my strength will undergo a qualitative leap, unafraid of novice Sages!”

Luo Tian’s resolve was firm. Yet he knew that continuing would likely shatter his dantian, rendering all efforts futile.

“Nine regions will soon be in chaos. I cannot miss any chance to enhance my strength!” Luo Tian recalled Diao Yuanshan’s words, his eyes flashing with ruthless intent. This was self-ruthlessness, reminiscent of the Luo Tian who had fought for cultivation with nine lives.

“Again!” Luo Tian laughed, thunderous roars echoing from his dantian. His holy power surged violently, golden lightning crackling within it.

Luo Tian’s hands formed a seal. His face was resolute, holding nothing back. A wild holy power surged from his hands toward the golden Era Bell.

“Dong…” The deafening sound echoed, divine words spreading. As Luo Tian’s holy power struck the golden Era Bell, a powerful roar surged into everyone’s minds. Sun Mengru and others nearly fell from the sky.

At the same time, the golden holy power rebounded, pulling back into Luo Tian’s dantian.

“Ah…” The pain made Luo Tian howl, his long hair flying. He seemed to have gone mad, blood spewing from his mouth.

Chapter 966: Nine is the Peak, Nine Regions in Turmoil

Within the ancient temple, the golden Era Bell rang out with a thunderous sound. Divine words echoed outward, leaving people in awe. All gazed at the agonized Luo Tian in the sky, their faces filled with fear.

The bell’s sound was like a massive hammer striking people's minds, leaving them pale to the core.

Not only that, but the bell’s sound spread throughout the ancient temple. All creatures within it felt their minds tremble.

In a sacred palace, eighteen figures sat in meditation on the ground. A sacred altar stood before them. All had their eyes closed, emitting calm energy. Yet beneath this tranquility was a terrifying power. If anyone entered the hall, they would be astonished.

These people were no ordinary beings. All radiated divine light; the weakest was a novice Sage, their blood and qi strong. Their ages varied greatly—some ancient with the weight of years, others appearing as middle-aged men.

Such a force could rival any sect or clan. As the bell rang, all opened their eyes, divine light flashing like lightning across the hall.

“Eight strikes! It seems the ancient temple has opened again. I wonder if anyone will strike nine,” a novice Sage elder with an aged face said, his voice filled with nostalgia.

“Eight strikes already place one among the greatest prodigies. I wonder if he can obtain what no one has—this Era Bell!” Another elder, also aged, spoke with admiration.

Others among the novice Sages also bore curiosity. They listened intently to know if the one striking the Era Bell could strike nine.

“Ah…” Luo Tian’s long hair flew as he grimaced, blood and sweat pouring from his mouth. His dantian felt like it would explode, holy power surging against the cracks in his dantian. Each impact made him agonize.

“Crack…” Cracks spread across Luo Tian’s dantian, appearing at a glance. It felt like it could shatter at any moment.

“Good opportunity!” Feng Jiutian’s eyes flashed with coldness. Seeing Luo Tian so weak and in agony, his killing intent surged.

Though he didn’t know what striking eight Era Bells meant, the fact that it made Luo Tian so painful indicated this was no easy task.

“Seize the moment!” Feng Jiutian took a step forward, his voice echoing with phoenix cries. A red flame formed into a phoenix’s image, striking toward Luo Tian, whose face was pale.

“Despicable!” Xu Liziye and others on the ground glared, cursing Feng Jiutian.

Sun Feiwen and others also bore disdain. Though Feng Jiutian was no weakling, he was no longer their match. This narrow-mindedness made him unworthy of being a prodigy.

“Indeed, the Demon Domain has declined!” Zhou Wei shook his head, moving to help Luo Tian. A black long sword appeared in his hand.

But as Zhou Wei prepared to intervene, the Era Bell emitted a deep hum. A figure emerged from it, his face cold. He waved his hand, golden light striking Feng Jiutian’s technique and dispersing it—this was the elder who had previously spoken against killing.

“During striking the Era Bell, no one may interfere!” The elder coldly spoke. His hand struck again, a terrifying pressure pinning Feng Jiutian.

“Peng…” Golden holy power surged across Feng Jiutian, leaving him stunned. Blood spewed from his mouth as he fell.

“Ten zhang… a hundred zhang…” Feng Jiutian finally stopped after falling a hundred zhang. Blood gushed from his mouth.

“Punished for falling a hundred zhang. If you repeat, I’ll destroy you!” The elder coldly spoke, his authority absolute. Golden light flashed before he vanished.

“Grandpa, you’re amazing! This scum should be crushed with one hand!” Xu Liziye and others laughed, speaking.

Feng Jiutian’s face bore surprise. He felt the immense pressure around him, his eyes flashing with hatred.

Falling a hundred zhang was difficult for Feng Jiutian. Previously, reaching there had cost him much. And the elder’s strike had wounded him. When he returned, he would be last.

Within the Era Bell, the elder’s face bore anger. “Hmph! These years I’ve cultivated in seclusion. Otherwise, you’d be dead already. It’s rare to find someone with potential to strike nine. You dare kill him! You’re really against me!”

The elder cursed within the Era Bell, abandoning his solemn image.

Luo Tian seemed unaware of what had happened. His dantian finally stopped cracking, allowing him to breathe a sigh of relief. He gazed at the Era Bell with renewed caution.

“One more strike—my limit, but with great risk!” Luo Tian’s pale face turned resolute.

“Only a little more! My dantian will be like that of a novice Sage!” Luo Tian clenched his fists, his body roaring with thunder. Golden holy power slowly emerged from him.

“Terrifying! Such pain, yet he still wants to strike again!” People marveled at Luo Tian in the sky. They felt his pain was terrifying.

“Prodigies need not only talent but also luck, effort, and the courage to gamble!” People’s eyes held admiration as they gazed at Luo Tian, their respect deep.

“Ninth strike!” Luo Tian roared, his body radiating powerful waves. His dantian’s golden holy power surged violently, filling the sky and even overshadowing the Era Bell’s light. It seemed to drown the bell.

“Go!” Luo Tian formed a seal, golden waves enveloping the Era Bell.

The deafening sound echoed. The entire hall trembled. Feng Jiutian, who had just climbed thirty zhang, fell with a crash, his body descending dozens of zhang. His eyes held disbelief, his face pale.

Sun Mengru and Sun Feiwen’s faces were also shocked. This ninth strike caused them to fall dozens of zhang before stabilizing.

The powerful bell sound left people on the ground pale. Some overexerted superhuman beings collapsed.

“Ninth strike!” In another hall, eighteen divine figures with radiant holy power bore shock. Even the two novice Sage elders were filled with disbelief.

The bell sound spread, igniting some fate’s connection. The long bell echoed through the ancient temple, golden light blazing. Those guarding the temple outside looked on in surprise.

“Is this the Era Bell!” In Sheng Cheng, Diao Yuanshan’s face bore a hint of fear. He muttered, sighing deeply.

The long bell sound soon spread through the Demon Domain and beyond, echoing throughout the nine regions.

The bell’s echo reached all elders of the nine regions. They opened their eyes, sighing deeply and transmitting messages to their descendants.

The bell’s echo reached the mysterious冥域 (Mingyu), where a novice Sage elder who had nearly crushed Luo Tian with one hand bore shock.

“Nine is the peak, nine regions in chaos! Who struck nine Era Bells!” The elder’s face bore沧桑 (sorrow), his eyes piercing through space toward the eight continents nearby.

“Finally, someone struck the Era Bell. This might be our great opportunity! You all must come out soon!” The elder’s eyes flashed with excitement.

Yet Luo Tian in the temple was unaware of how震撼 (shocking) his ninth strike had been. At that moment, he was surrounded by endless pain, in unbearable agony.

“Crack…” Cracking sounds echoed within Luo Tian’s dantian. The dantian kept cracking, spreading outward. It was unstoppable.

“Intention is thought; thought becomes form. Yin and Yang merge in the dantian…” As Luo Tian trembled, a string of words echoed into his mind—this was the elder’s transmission.

The elder’s face bore endless excitement, transmitting to Luo Tian without hiding his joy.

Chapter 967: Resounding Through Nine Regions

In the ancient temple’s grand hall, Luo Tian’s mind roared with the elder’s excited transmission.

Luo Tian’s heart trembled. He resisted the urge to faint, continuously maneuvering his dantian’s wild golden ocean as per the elder’s transmission.

Outside, people looked puzzled. They watched Luo Tian gradually shift from pain to a furrowed brow, then to calmness—unsure what he was experiencing.

Yet they knew Luo Tian might have encountered a great opportunity. Their eyes held envy as they watched the calmed Luo Tian.

On the ground, Xu Liziye and Long Jie wore smiles. They gazed at Luo Tian. Though they didn’t know what striking the ninth Era Bell meant, it was clear that this strike wasn’t easy.

“Girl! You come. I see your talent is good!” The elder’s voice echoed from the sky, his gaze on Sun Mengru. His tone held a hint of amusement.

Sun Mengru was stunned. She hadn’t expected an opportunity to strike the Era Bell. Her eyes held joy as she gazed at the Era Bell, bowing before flying toward it. She unleashed her cultivation power, striking the bell.

The bell echoed again, mirroring Luo Tian’s experience. People’s faces bore hope, expecting someone to surpass Luo Tian.

“Ah! I see now!” Sun Mengru’s eyes lit with understanding. She felt her dantian expand, then gazed at Luo Tian with admiration.

At that moment, she realized what Luo Tian had endured and the pain he had faced.

“I can too!” Sun Mengru’s eyes flashed with defiance. Her cultivation power surged, divine light radiating. The overwhelming holy power was no less than Luo Tian’s.

“Such a terrifying woman! No wonder she’s the Divine Clan’s divine daughter!” People murmured, their faces filled with disbelief.

Even Xu Liziye and others wore shock. They knew Luo Tian’s strength was clear—his holy power stemmed from his original novice Sage level.

But what was Sun Mengru’s cultivation? She was at the threshold of Sage. Her age seemed much younger than Luo Tian, and people knew she was Chen Yunting’s reincarnation. Her age was definitely under twenty.

“Damn! I’m scared Luo Tian might marry this woman and be dominated by her!” Diao Dedu’s face bore shock, gazing at Sun Mengru.

“Her youth is a threshold Sage. What terrifying talent! She’s surely the next Divine King of the Divine Clan!” Others from different regions bore shock, gazing at Sun Mengru.

Sun Feiwen’s face held a hint of reverence. He stood before Sun Mengru, guarding her. The only one who truly knew Sun Mengru was the Divine Clan’s Sun He Feng, followed by Sun Feiwen.

The “Primordial Body” was a rare body in the Divine Clan, appearing once every thousand years. When Sun Mengru was born, the entire Divine Clan erupted in celebration, accompanied by countless miracles.

The Primordial Body’s power was so great it caused Sun Mengru’s mother to die shortly after giving birth. Her father also died due to bloodline ties.

The Divine Clan’s Divine King, Sun Shengtian, personally emerged from seclusion to lay a solid foundation for Sun Mengru. He named her the Divine Clan’s divine daughter, passing on the legacy of the previous divine daughter through blood.

In the Divine Clan, it was recorded that the Primordial Body was powerful but always isolated its loved ones. It led to a life of solitude and strength.

Sun Mengru was raised by Sun He Feng. Her personality was somewhat reclusive. Though her cultivation speed was unparalleled, no one in the Divine Clan could match her—only Sun Feiwen occasionally spoke a few words to her.

“Alas… pitiful!” Sun Feiwen’s face bore a faint smile. He gazed at the radiant Sun Mengru, knowing she hadn’t been reclusive in her childhood.

“Dong…” The heavy bell sound interrupted Sun Feiwen’s memories, returning his face to pride. He gazed at Sun Mengru with endless admiration.

“One… two…” The bell’s sound echoed, and Sun Mengru no longer held her previous calmness. Her face was drenched in sweat, determination in her eyes as her dantian cracked open.

“Eight strikes!” Sun Mengru’s face was grim. She gritted her teeth, gazing at the Era Bell with unyielding determination. She knew eight strikes were her limit, but she refused to yield.

“Eight strikes! This time’s entrant is good. Another eight, but it’s still just that. Nine strikes are so difficult—no one in the same era can achieve two!” In another hall, eighteen seated sages bore a hint of admiration. They murmured.

“Eight strikes! Just one more to match Luo Tian!” People’s faces bore anticipation, gazing at Sun Mengru in the sky.

“Monstrous! I’ve finally seen someone more monstrous than Luo Tian!” Xu Liziye and others had wide eyes, gazing at the proud woman.

“Huff…,” Sun Mengru’s heavy breathing echoed. The intense tearing sensation in her dantian made her face pale, blood gushing from her mouth like a spring.

“I… won’t… yield…” Sun Mengru seemed to vent, ignoring her dantian’s ongoing cracks. Her face bore endless madness. Her white robe fluttered, her pale face beautiful enough to break hearts.

Her cultivation power surged violently, rushing toward the Era Bell. People’s faces bore disbelief.

“Don’t…” Sun Feiwen and Divine Clan members shouted, their faces shocked. They felt Sun Mengru’s madness—like suicide—but no one could stop her.

“Dong…” The heavy bell sound echoed. The grand hall fell silent, all eyes on the woman who had struck the ninth strike and plummeted.

“Ninth strike!” After Sun Mengru struck the ninth, another hall saw eighteen seated sages open their eyes. Their faces bore disbelief.

“Impossible!” The eighteenth spoke in unison, their faces filled with shock. They gazed into the void, trying to see who had struck nine again.

“This time’s entrant in the ancient temple… what monstrous being is this?” The eighteenth murmured, the hall suddenly chaotic.

“Interesting. A new era is coming!” Two novice Sage elders smiled, sitting down.

“Wait. This prodigy will surely reach us!” The eighteenth’s faces were excited, no longer seated but standing, waiting for the entrants’ arrival.

Outside the ancient temple, it was also chaotic. All sects and clans’ elders bore confusion, gazing through space toward the Demon Domain.

“Strange. Not sure if it’s good or bad. Something changed, obscuring fate!” In the Star-Weaving Region, an old man with a weathered face stood with his hands behind him. His aged eyes gazed at the stars, confusion on his face.

“Why did it ring twice?” All sects and clans’ elders began to calculate, but found no results.

“Primordial Body! Almost achieved!” In a vast hall of the Divine Clan, a man in golden imperial robes bore a hint of joy. His eyes flashed with golden runes as he held a green bamboo in his hand, its vitality merging into his body.

Mysteriously, behind him, a pool of blood roared. A youth floated in the blood pool, golden runes flowing over his body. As the bell echoed, the youth slowly opened his eyes. A blood-red aura flickered before golden light surged from him, causing the entire pool to swirl into a vortex, merging into the youth’s body.

Golden light illuminated the hall. Contrary to its previous eerie aura, the youth now radiated a strong golden light, like an invincible warrior emerging from a withered blood pool. He approached the man in golden robes.

“Father!” The youth knelt, his face respectful.

“Good. You’ve not only survived but reached novice Sage level. I haven’t wasted these years in vain!” The man’s face bore a smile, his eyes filled with satisfaction as he gazed at the youth radiating golden light.

“Rest well. With this immortal bamboo, I’ve saved a divine daughter. The Primordial Body… I’m quite reluctant to kill her. Let her be your consort. You’re an immortal body—what strength will your offspring possess?” The man smiled, addressing the youth.

“The Primordial Body? Not bad!” The youth smiled, licking his lips. His eyes bore anticipation.

As the nine regions again trembled and the Era Bell rang, Luo Tian was also shaken by the bell. He slowly opened his eyes, his aura rising again, fully recovering to novice Sage level.

At the moment he opened his eyes, he saw Sun Mengru falling. Her pale face made him feel心疼 (pain). He flashed forward, a streak of light, arriving before Sun Feiwen.
