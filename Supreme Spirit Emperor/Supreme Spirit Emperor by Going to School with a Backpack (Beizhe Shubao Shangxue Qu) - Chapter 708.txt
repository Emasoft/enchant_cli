“Father!” In an instant, Blood Saint Fei saw the same illusory Blood Lord, his eyes filled with disbelief before transforming into excitement.

“Shengfei, it’s over!” The Blood Lord’s face bore a rare smile as he flew toward Tu Shengfei, never imagining their reunion would occur this way—two weakened souls.

“Father, flee! This opponent is too powerful! Luotian, take my father away quickly—he’s about to awaken!” Tu Shengfei shouted desperately at Luotian.

“Flee? I’ll take you with me; the elder won’t leave without you!” Luotian replied with a bitter smile, watching Tu Shengfei still connected to the soul.

“Greedy scoundrel!” Luotian sighed, raising his hand and sending a soul force into the Emperor’s Soul.

“Luotian!” Tu Shengfei gasped as Luotian’s soul merged with his, eyes brimming with gratitude.

Tu Shengfei was also stunned; he hadn’t expected Luotian to sacrifice his soul to save him, despite their past enmity.

*Buzz…*

As Luotian’s soul force merged into the Emperor’s Soul, it trembled slightly, startling the three.

“What’s happening?” Luotian rubbed his eyes, gazing at the Blood Lord and Tu Shengfei.

“Did he just move?” Luotian asked, disbelieving his own eyes.

“You saw it too?” The Blood Lord and son spoke in unison, their bodies trembling involuntarily.

What surprised Luotian further was that his soul force had caused no disturbance—only a faint soul force seeped back into Tu Shengfei’s soul.

“Not releasing yet?” Luotian’s face darkened, sensing the Emperor’s Soul was insatiable. Even if he let Tu Shengfei go, Luotian would accept it; with his methods, restoring them was merely a matter of time.

“If you don’t release him, I swear I’ll torment you in every way possible!” Luotian growled, his voice laced with madness.

“Do you think you’re谁?” Luotian’s words were met with a cold voice in his mind, striking him like lightning.

Chapter 2664: The Supreme Evil Emperor of Eternity ()

“Who are you?” Luotian’s body went numb upon hearing the voice, his gaze fixed on the soul bound by nine chains.

“It’s me—the Supreme Evil Emperor of Eternity, Ren Wujie!” The cold voice echoed in Luotian’s mind, radiating immense pressure from the soul.

“The Supreme Evil Emperor of Eternity…” Luotian’s lips twitched, staring at the soul, sensing this title was no ordinary foe.

“Boy, let’s make a deal: surrender your soul to me, and I’ll free this boy!” Before Luotian could respond, the voice spoke again, its tone domineering.

“You’re dreaming! Though you’re strong, you’re trapped here. Want my soul? Dream on!” Luotian retorted coldly, detecting Ren Wujie’s greed.

He also realized his soul merging with Ren Wujie’s might have awakened him.

“Then he’ll never leave!” Ren Wujie’s voice echoed in Luotian’s mind.

“Is that so? I don’t believe it!” Luotian snorted, unleashing ten-colored flames from his hands to engulf Ren Wujie’s soul, beginning to refine it.

“Haha! Can a tiny human flame defeat me? Even the great fire of Ye had no effect on me, and I eventually subdued it. What use is this tiny flame?”

“You’re too foolish!”

“I don’t demand much—eighty percent of your soul to exchange for this boy’s freedom. It’s a fair deal!” Ren Wujie sneered.

“Luotian, what’s happening?” The Blood Lord turned to Luotian, unable to hear their exchange, his worry evident.

“Nothing serious—just a minor trouble. Elder, rest assured!” Luotian replied, his eyes thoughtful.

Luotian puzzled over why the man wanted his soul; clearly, his soul held something special that Ren Wujie craved.

“My blood and soul conceal secrets!” Luotian recalled when the Black and White Officials had demanded a drop of his blood, leading to his breakthrough into the Immortal King peak.

“Good things shouldn’t be given away!” Luotian muttered, patting the Evil Obstacle Mirror. Annihilation Light erupted from it, shooting toward Ren Wujie.

The annihilating light struck Ren Wujie immediately but only stirred faint gray soul forces, making Luotian smirk.

“This bastard is too strong…” Luotian cursed inwardly, though prepared; after all, Ren Wujie’s soul had even defeated the Yellow Springs. Though time had weakened it, Luotian hadn’t expected annihilating light to fail against him.

“Think I’m still a fragmented soul? Even if you bring an Immortal King peak, destroying me is impossible!” Ren Wujie sneered, clearly aware of the fragmented soul ordeal.

Soul Blade!

Luotian roared, clenching his hands and slicing toward the connection between Ren Wujie and Tu Shengfei.

*Crack…*

Yet, no destruction occurred; the soul blade shattered before Luotian.

“How to proceed?” Luotian felt helpless but kept his composure, strategizing.

“Haha! You’re no match for your father!” The sneering voice echoed in Luotian’s mind, making him start.

“My father?” Luotian didn’t know what Ren Wujie meant; his father was Luonantian, currently on the Tianyuan Continent. How could he know Ren Wujie, a superpower from ancient times?

“Oh right! You still don’t remember!” Ren Wujie’s voice carried mockery, deepening Luotian’s confusion.

“What are you talking about?” Luotian replied, this matter involving Luonantian demanded his attention.

“Do you know where you came from? If I’m not mistaken, you’ve reincarnated nine times, becoming a Reincarnation Body. But do you know what you were before your first life?” Ren Wujie’s voice echoed, making Luotian start. He only knew his first life was Luonantian’s son.

“Want to know? Your father was immensely powerful! Give me eighty percent of your soul, and I’ll tell you!” Ren Wujie coaxed, his voice laced with hypnotic power, making Luotian’s mind fuzzy as he glimpsed a towering figure.

“Ugh…” As Luotian was confused, mournful cries echoed in his mind, snapping him back.

Luotian’s eyes brightened, a glint of realization: “I almost forgot about these two!”

He waved his hand, waves rippling from his wrist. Two black dogs materialized—one with two heads, the other with three, their five eyes glowing with resentment, staring at Luotian.

“Alright, see if you can devour him!” Luotian pointed at Ren Wujie.

“Woof…!” Upon seeing Ren Wujie, the two black dogs drooled.

“Three-Headed Dogs!” Ren Wujie gasped, dread rising.

“I am the Emperor, a sovereign of nine heavens! You dare eat me?”

“Woof…!”

“What Emperor? You’re a ghost, a soul—belong to us two!” The dogs projected their thoughts, confronting Ren Wujie.

“I am a sovereign! I’m stronger than your master!” Ren Wujie retorted.

“Enough talk—devour him!” The dogs howled, drooling as they lunged at Ren Wujie’s soul.

Bladed teeth pierced Ren Wujie’s soul, nearly driving him mad.

“I, the ancient Emperor, am bitten by two dogs!” Ren Wujie seethed; in his era, three-headed dogs were legendary beasts, akin to hellish totems. He knew they specialized in devouring souls—against them, he had no confidence.

The two black dogs gnawed hungrily, biting a chunk from Ren Wujie’s soul. Though small, it thrilled Luotian.

“Bite here first!” Luotian directed the dogs toward the connection between Ren Wujie and Tu Shengfei. Severing it would free Tu Shengfei; as for after, Luotian had many methods to strengthen his soul.

“Woof…!” Before Luotian’s words faded, the dogs lunged at his指示.

Chapter 2665: The Reincarnation Child ()

*Crunch…*
The sharp teeth sank into the gray soul connection, creating two small gaps. Gray mist seeped into the dogs’ bodies with a thunderous roar.

As the two dogs devoured the soul forces, their power surged rapidly. These creatures had ascended by devouring souls and ghosts; an Emperor’s soul was a rare delicacy.

“Back then, that fellow raised three-headed dogs!”
“Damn it, why didn’t I think of this? This kid has two!” Ren Wujie cursed mentally, recalling something.

“Stop!” Ren Wujie roared, sensing danger. He knew even if these dogs devoured his soul for millennia, it wouldn’t finish him—but it would weaken him. If Luotian stayed here to fight for millennia, the dogs’ strength would grow rapidly, and their consumption would accelerate.

But the three-headed dogs ignored him, hungrily gnawing at the connection between Ren Wujie and Tu Shengfei.

“Approximately seven days to sever,” Luotian sighed, though it cost some time, he could endure it.

“Boy, I’ll let him go—make these dogs stop!” Ren Wujie’s voice echoed in Luotian’s mind, his gaze fierce.

“I’ll consider it,” Luotian smiled, finally holding the upper hand.

Time passed slowly; after three days, Ren Wujie was nearly broken. The thought of being bitten by two dogs for three days made him want to scream.

“Open!” On the fourth day, Ren Wujie gritted his teeth, severing the connection. Tu Shengfei’s soul floated free, immediately snatched by Luotian.

“Boy, leave! Don’t push me—unless you want to die!” Ren Wujie raged, his voice laced with fury. If he had a body, Luotian would feel him trembling.

But the response was a black tongue licking Ren Wujie’s face and a blood-red maw biting his head.

“Big Black, Second Black, don’t go too far!” Luotian scolded the two dogs as they lunged at Ren Wujie’s head.

Luotian feared Ren Wujie would go mad; after all, he was an ancient Emperor. Though only a soul, his power was boundless—perhaps some restraint kept him from attacking.

The two black dogs had grown plump, approaching Luotian with greedy eyes toward Ren Wujie.

“Boy, that’s fair—go!” Ren Wujie, regaining his dignity after Luotian recalled the dogs, spoke.

“Go? I won’t leave without a profit!” Luotian smiled, gazing at Ren Wujie. He ordered the dogs: “Go—bite his legs!”

“Woof…!” The dogs lunged again.

“Damn you!” Ren Wujie cursed, but the dogs nipped his legs repeatedly. Though a soul, he felt chills; several times, he sensed coldness near his groin, nearly biting his vital spot.

“Boy, what are you doing?” Ren Wujie groaned, vowing to kill this kid and the dogs if he ever escaped.

“Just borrowing your soul—no other intent!” Luotian shook his head, wary of Ren Wujie’s cunning.

“You…” Ren Wujie glared at Luotian, speechless. Even as an ancient Emperor, he was trapped here—no way to retaliate unless he risked everything. The standoff continued; Luotian watched Ren Wujie, the dogs devouring his soul. Though calm, he was tense, fearing Ren Wujie’s desperation. He was testing the Emperor’s limits.

“Strength is key—this fellow must be eliminated, or he’ll remain a threat!” Luotian mused, watching the dogs.

Time passed; seven days later, Luotian and the Blood Lord saw Ren Wujie’s legs missing chunks. The dogs had returned to balls, lying on the ground, too exhausted to move.

“Unsurpassed Emperor’s soul—this is enough for Big Black and Second Black!” Luotian gazed at Ren Wujie standing there.

“Full?” Luotian watched the dogs, feeling they’d undergo a qualitative leap if they devoured Ren Wujie.

“Finally finished…” For Ren Wujie, these days were torment; he’d never been so humiliated.

“Boy, don’t let me escape—when I do, I’ll torment you and these dogs with ten thousand methods!” Ren Wujie’s voice echoed in Luotian’s mind. Now that the dogs were full, he no longer feared Luotian.

“Ah…” Luotian started at Ren Wujie’s words, having planned to leave. But Ren Wujie was no pushover.

“Then I won’t go—wait for me to die, let the dogs digest first, then eat more!” Luotian waved his hand, releasing the two black dogs again.

“You…”

“Too arrogant!” Ren Wujie’s voice echoed, terrified. He didn’t know when the three-headed dogs would finish digesting.

“Answer my question, and I’ll leave!” Luotian spoke, gazing at Ren Wujie. He patted the dogs’ heads; he had many questions for Ren Wujie.

“Speak!” Ren Wujie, forced to answer to avoid being bitten, replied.

“Who is my father?” Luotian asked directly, his greatest mystery.

“Reincarnation!” Ren Wujie replied, making Luotian start. He recalled the Black and White Officials’ exclamation about being a Reincarnation Child. Initially, he thought it was his体质 (constitution), but now it seemed true.

Chapter 2666: Escape ()

“Reincarnation—again, who?” Luotian asked again. Though he had no memory of Reincarnation, his only father was Luonantian, and other lives were vague—only nine years old.

“Reincarnation Immortal Emperor, ruler of Reincarnation, one of the three ancient Immortal Emperors. He was a sovereign of this world!” Ren Wujie spoke with reverence.

Luotian was stunned; the Reincarnation Immortal Emperor’s origin was so grand. Ren Wujie, the Supreme Evil Emperor of Eternity, was strong—yet he revered this Reincarnation Emperor. How powerful must the latter be?

“As for why you’re like this, I don’t know. Perhaps it’s because of your connection to the Reincarnation Emperor!”

“Because he rules Reincarnation!” Ren Wujie added, his voice also puzzled.

He had been destroyed by the Yellow Springs and trapped here; he hadn’t experienced the era of Emperors’ demise or Immortal Kings’ bloodshed. He didn’t know why the Reincarnation Child, Luotian, was like this—thought the Reincarnation Emperor had perished, and his lineage weakened over time.

“This fellow might be the only living Emperor!” Luotian sighed internally; if there were Emperors, they’d have unified the Hellish Immortal Realm.

If Ren Wujie escaped, though only a soul, he’d be unmatched—anybody he possessed would be invincible.

“Regardless of what happened, I am Luotian!” Luotian muttered internally, his eyes resolute.

“Hmm, how to exit this small world? Don’t tell me you, an Emperor, can’t!” Luotian asked again. Though he could open the Reincarnation Passage to leave, he didn’t want to yet.

“The center of this small world is the only exit. I don’t know its current state, but that’s all I know!” Ren Wujie replied.

“One last request—give me some soul energy!” Luotian spoke softly, gazing at Ren Wujie. He knew this fellow’s soul was precious.

“Boy, you’re overstepping!” Ren Wujie roared at Luotian’s words. Soul energy was his life; how could he give it?

“Then I won’t leave!” Luotian crossed his arms, refusing to go.

“You dare defy me?” Ren Wujie’s cold voice echoed in Luotian’s mind.

“Try me!” Luotian smirked, watching Ren Wujie. He couldn’t yet discern the Emperor’s limits.

“Impossible!” Ren Wujie finally lost control, his black-eyed soul emitting overwhelming pressure, spreading imperial qi. Luotian was startled.

Pressure descended; nine black dragons appeared, roaring—those nine chains binding Ren Wujie.

Ren Wujie’s eyes opened, revealing two gray ones in Luotian and the Blood Lord’s view.

“Farewell!” Luotian quickly recalled the dogs, grabbed the Blood Lord’s soul, and fled the barrier without hesitation.

“Boy, be brave—don’t run!” The Emperor’s voice echoed in Luotian’s ears. The overwhelming pressure nearly made him fall from the sky.

Luotian shivered, sensing this pressure could crush him.

In an instant, he burst through the barrier, grabbed Tu Shengfei’s body, and dashed into the forest depths to find a way to restore the Blood Lord and Tu Shengfei, then escape.

As Luotian left, Ren Wujie’s aura calmed, his gray eyes burning with fury.

“Thankfully, I was smart; otherwise, this kid would’ve trapped me!” Ren Wujie sighed internally. Though he seemed powerful, it was a bluff to scare Luotian away.

“But what’s the situation now? The Reincarnation Emperor’s son is still alive? How many years have passed!” Ren Wujie pondered, his information outdated. He didn’t know the ancient era had collapsed.

Luotian fled into the forest depths, relieved when no one pursued. He sighed deeply.

“Too terrifying—when an Immortal Emperor is angry, the pressure is overwhelming!” Luotian landed on a mountain peak, placing Tu Shengfei’s body down. He waved his hand, releasing the Blood Lord and Tu Shengfei’s souls.

He merged Tu Shengfei’s soul into his body; the latter opened his eyes, pale-faced.

“Boy, thank you!” Tu Shengfei’s eyes held gratitude, gazing at Luotian. Without him, they might’ve perished here.

“Elder, you’ve helped me much. Don’t mention it; I’ll restore your souls!” Luotian shook his head, ignoring the thanks. He took out the Void Heaven Cauldron and began crafting soul-repairing pills.

A roar echoed; for days, Luotian crafted pills to heal souls, which Tu Shengfei and the Blood Lord took.

After seven days, Tu Shengfei’s soul recovered five percent; the Blood Lord’s three. The latter returned to his sword, and Luotian didn’t ask for the sword.

“Lu Xiong, about past matters…”

“Tu Xiong, let bygones be bygones. The Blood Lord helped me; we both come from the Nine Domains!” Luotian interrupted, cutting off Tu Shengfei’s words.

They took flight toward the small world’s center. Though vast, their Immortal King strength let them reach it quickly.

During the journey, Tu Shengfei recounted his years. He had also descended into Hell but was unlucky, falling into the Yellow Springs’ tomb and entering this small world.

In this ancient relic, he’d survived, seizing most opportunities. His strength rose to Immortal King mid-level. Finally, he tried entering the barrier trapping Ren Wujie and was caught.

“Originally, you took them…” Luotian realized, recalling he’d found some places searched before.

“Haha, someone finally came!” As they reached the center, a loud laugh echoed.

Chapter 2667: Xu Liyi ()

“Who!” Luotian and Tu Shengfei’s faces changed, gazing around. Except for a mountain at the center, they saw no one.

“Who? I am who! This mountain is mine; this path is mine. To pass, pay the toll!” A bold voice echoed in their ears, making Luotian start.

“This voice…” Luotian frowned, gazing at the mountain’s peak—a figure stood there, holding an axe.

Luotian felt this voice was familiar, especially the bandit’s rhetoric, reminding him of someone.

“Can’t be…” Luotian’s eyes narrowed, golden light flashing as he saw the figure.

“How is this possible? I’ve been here three thousand years and never seen anyone!” Tu Shengfei gaped.

“Xu Liyi!” Luotian exclaimed, eyes alight with excitement as his Lei Yang Eye opened.

A roar—Luotian flew down, rushing toward the mountain.

Excited, he never expected to meet Xu Liyi here. When he ascended to the Immortal Realm, Xu Liyi had stayed behind due to family matters; Luotian hadn’t let him follow. In his mind, Xu Liyi should be in the Nine Domains.

In an instant, Luotian landed on the peak. Though years had passed and their appearances changed, he immediately recognized Xu Liyi.

“Why are you here?” Luotian shouted, gazing at the middle-aged Xu Liyi, eyes alight with joy.

“Who are you?” But Xu Liyi’s reply was a question and his axe slicing toward Luotian.

*Crack…*
The green axe descended, making Luotian’s face change. He didn’t hesitate, gripping his Rupture Spear to meet Xu Liyi’s axe.

*Crack!* Luotian stood firm; Xu Liyi was thrown back, eyes surprised.

“Good kid, a tough nut! To leave, you must surrender your treasures!” Xu Liyi roared, pretending not to know Luotian.

“Brother, I’m Luotian!” Luotian shouted, helpless as Xu Liyi seemed normal but didn’t recognize him.

“Who’s your brother? Pay or die!” Xu Liyi roared, lifting his axe again.

“What’s going on?” Luotian was confused, but Xu Liyi’s attack, though strong, was manageable for his Immortal King late-stage strength. He’d sensed Xu Liyi’s cultivation was only True Immortal mid-level, making it easy to counter.

Clashes echoed; spear and axe clashed repeatedly. Soon, Luotian swept his spear at Xu Liyi’s back, subduing him.

“Idiot, don’t you recognize me?” Luotian cursed, observing Xu Liyi’s condition. His brows furrowed.

*Smack!*
Luotian struck Xu Liyi’s butt with his spear, making him yell: “Idiot, let me go—let’s fight three hundred rounds!”

“Fight your grandma!” Luotian kept striking Xu Liyi.

“I swear, Luotian, you’re playing for real!” After a while, Xu Liyi relented, cursing.

“I just wanted to have fun—I’ve waited years for someone! I was bored!” Xu Liyi shouted, making Luotian stop.

Luotian blinked; he hadn’t expected Xu Liyi to be faking it. He stopped beating him, helping Xu Liyi up.

“Brother!” They hugged fiercely, eyes brimming with joy.

“What happened? Why are you here? How’s the Nine Domains?” Luotian released Xu Liyi, asking directly.

“The Nine Domains are in trouble!” Upon hearing Luotian’s question, Xu Liyi’s expression changed, his eyes filled with urgency.

Hearing this, Luotian’s heart dropped; he’d sensed the Nine Domains’ trouble before dying.

“Tell me!” Luotian urged, as Tu Shengfei also focused on Xu Liyi—Nine Domains were his home.

“You left, and the Nine Domains underwent a massive transformation!”

“Did you return to warn them about trouble?” Xu Liyi replied, his gaze questioning Luotian.

“Did you hear my call?” Luotian’s eyes flickered, surprised this was real.

“Yes! Fortunately, you warned us; otherwise, we’d have been unprepared!” Xu Liyi sighed, recalling the catastrophe.

“You said there was a catastrophe; we’ve been on edge ever since. Master Ji Jiuyou awakened, and he left the Nine Domains’ limits to find a star domain approaching the Nine Domains.

We fought hard to delay it, but that star domain was two or three times larger and stronger. Though we delayed for a while to let the Nine Domains develop, two star domains collided two hundred years ago.

That collision wasn’t just a catastrophe for the Nine Domains but also for the other star domain!”

“Countless lives were lost; both star domains turned blood-red. If we hadn’t prepared, the Nine Domains would’ve been destroyed!” Xu Liyi’s eyes were sorrowful as he recounted.

Luotian and Tu Shengfei listened intently, feeling the bloodshed of the star domain collision.

“Afterward, both domains rested for a couple centuries. Then came conflict; that collision left Luoli and Xiting revived, leaving no choice but to face the end. Both star domains suffered trauma!”

“Then how was the battle?” Luotian’s eyes showed anxiety. He could imagine the brutality of two star domains’ fight, worrying about his loved ones.

“Fairly well? But some old friends are dead—like Dong Sansi, who was killed by a纪元之主 (Epoch Lord) from the other domain!” Xu Liyi replied.

“Epoch Lord? How is that possible?” Luotian and Tu Shengfei gasped, stunned.

Chapter 2668: Tianyang Domain ()

“Exactly, an Epoch Lord. But don’t worry—after that collision, it seems anyone could become one,” Xu Liyi smiled at Luotian and Tu Shengfei’s shocked expressions.

Luotian furrowed his brows, sensing the star domain collision was just beginning—something bigger awaited.

At the same time, he felt sorrow for many old friends who might have died.

“What’s the current situation?”

“And how did you end up in the Immortal Realm?” Luotian asked, gazing at Xu Liyi.

“I’ve been here nearly a hundred years. Is this the Immortal Realm?” Upon hearing Luotian’s words, Xu Liyi widened his eyes in disbelief.

“More accurately, it’s Hell—a tomb of a great immortal!” Luotian briefly explained.

“Became an Immortal? I’ve become one?” Xu Liyi’s eyes were shocked. Though he felt stronger, he didn’t know he was now an Immortal in the Nine Domains.

“What are you?” Xu Liyi asked, puzzled, feeling small before Luotian and Tu Shengfei.

“Immortal King…” Luotian replied, recounting the Immortal Realm and Hell’s affairs.

“Ah, I’m still weak!” Xu Liyi sighed but felt no defeat; he and his companions like Diao Dezhu were always optimistic.

“He came from the star domain that collided with the Nine Domains—Yongyang Domain. After the collision, a deadly zone emerged as their battlefield. I fought with a strong figure from Yongyang Domain; we clashed, and a Dao Platform opened. The platform flew out of the domain, traveling for unknown time until I arrived here!” Xu Liyi explained.

Luotian furrowed his brows, learning Xu Liyi had flown on the platform for over a decade to reach here.

“Does it take ten years from the Nine Domains to the Immortal Realm?” Luotian muttered, unsure of the platform’s speed. He asked: “Do you remember the route?”

“No, the platform was too fast; my strength at that time couldn’t track it,” Xu Liyi sighed.

“Where is the platform?” Luotian asked, gazing around. Before Xu Liyi could answer, he saw the massive platform atop the mountain.

The platform spanned a thousand zhang (approx. 300 meters), etched with Dao laws, but its aura was faint yet powerful.

Xu Liyi blushed, addressing Luotian: “When I arrived here, I sensed strong aura on the platform and tried to refine it. Finding it boosted my strength, so I’ve been refining it ever since!”

“Xu! Get out here—my world-shattering martial arts are complete! I’ll kill you today!” As the three conversed, a roar echoed. A figure appeared, also radiating True Immortal aura.

“Another one came!” The figure approached Luotian and Tu Shengfei, blinking.

“Idiot! Come on—fight me! My brother’s here; I’ll kill you today!” Seeing the newcomer, Xu Liyi’s eyes flashed with light, gazing at the rugged middle-aged man.

“Who is he?” Tu Shengfei blinked, puzzled. He’d spent more time in this world than Xu Liyi but hadn’t met them before. This made him suspicious; he knew the small world was as dangerous as a perilous place.

But Tu Shengfei didn’t speak, as two True Immortals posed no threat to him and Luotian.

As Tu Shengfei pondered, Xu Liyi and the middle-aged man clashed, both using blades. They fought evenly, neither gaining an edge.
