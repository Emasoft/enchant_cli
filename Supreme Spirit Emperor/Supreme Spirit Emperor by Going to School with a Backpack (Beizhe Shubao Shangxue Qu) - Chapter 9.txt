Though Yang Huanyu initially repelled Zhang Dao Yi with a few steps, the disparity in strength was too great. Eventually, Yang Huanyu employed an unknown martial technique to send Zhang Dao Yi sprawling over ten paces before declaring the match concluded.

"Yang Huanyu, would you like to join my Tian Du Sect as my sole disciple?" Wu Ping'an spoke first, attempting to recruit him.

"Yang Huanyu, would you like to join my Thick Earth Sect?" Huang Jingshan's voice echoed.

"Another peak leader, and one who is the sole disciple of Tian Du Sect! That means he might become the future peak leader of Tian Du Sect!" The crowd marveled at Yang Huanyu's remarkable status.

Wu Ping'an's eyes gleamed with determination, convinced no one could resist the temptation of becoming the future peak leader of Tian Du Sect.

Huang Jingshan observed Wu Ping'an's smug expression but said nothing, his gaze flickering with a hint of mockery.

"Disciple chooses the Thick Earth Sect!" Yang Huanyu's calm voice echoed.

When Yang Huanyu's calm words rang out, a wave of astonishment swept through the crowd. Especially Wu Ping'an, who had already assumed victory, was taken aback by Yang Huanyu's choice of the Thick Earth Sect.

"Ha! Old toxin, sorry, this time you'll leave empty-handed!" Huang Jingshan chuckled triumphantly, stepping beside Yang Huanyu. Surprisingly, he didn't make Yang Huanyu kneel to swear allegiance but merely patted his shoulder lightly.

"Hmph!" Wu Ping'an snorted, turning back to his seat. He reached for a teacup but shattered it instantly in his grip, clearly furious.

"Next is Luo Tian!" Zhang Dao Yi's voice echoed into Luo Tian's ears.

The crowd perked up, eager to see if the Five Elements Body who had shone on the Ascending Stairs could still astonish them.

"Next is Luo Tian!" Zhang Dao Yi murmured, his expression tinged with tension.

Luo Tian nodded to Gu Qianxue before leaping onto the arena, bowing respectfully to Zhang Dao Yi: "Please instruct me, Senior Brother!"

Zhang Dao Yi nodded inwardly, approving Luo Tian's character. Yet he sighed internally: "If only you hadn't stirred up trouble in Xuantian City!"

"He harbors murderous intent!" Luo Tian's mind jolted. Though Zhang Dao Yi masked his hostility well, only Luo Tian's habit of extending his spiritual awareness would have revealed it. He puzzled over when he had offended such a figure.

"Little brother, please!" Zhang Dao Yi's voice interrupted Luo Tian's thoughts.

Luo Tian lifted his head, eyes narrowing as a name surfaced in his mind: "Zhang Xuantian!"

Chapter 38: Battle Against Zhang Dao Yi

Luo Tian's mind involuntarily recalled the name of Xuantian City's lord, Zhang Xuantian. Zhang Dao Yi bore a striking resemblance to him, and both shared the same surname. Luo Tian suddenly understood the situation.

"Dan Sect has already publicly announced their acceptance of me as a disciple. He dares not attack me openly; doing so would insult Dan Sect's honor. The only chance is to tamper with the exam. If he accidentally kills or cripples me during the match, Dan Sect may be angry but cannot retaliate too harshly!" Luo Tian mused.

Luo Tian's guess was nearly accurate, except he misjudged Dan Sect's overprotectiveness. If Zhang Dao Yi accidentally killed Luo Tian, the punishment would be far graver than mere reprimand.

Yet no one knew Zhang Dao Yi's other identity: he was Zhang Xuantian's illegitimate son. Even Zhang Qǐ didn't know, otherwise Zhang Dao Yi's talent wouldn't have allowed him to reach the Refining Body Nine Stages so young.

After hearing Zhang Qǐ's account of Xuantian City and Luo Tian's feud, Zhang Dao Yi realized that if Luo Tian grew strong, he would threaten Zhang Xuantian. As a son, Zhang Dao Yi couldn't allow Luo Tian to confront his father. The only solution was to eradicate the threat.

Thus, Zhang Dao Yi devised this plan: becoming an exam candidate and accidentally crippling or killing Luo Tian during the match. Even if he died, Xuantian City and Zhang Xuantian would remain—worth the risk.

Luo Tian scoffed internally. Though the exam was imminent, even if he exposed Zhang Dao Yi's intent, without his admission, his words would sound absurd. People would mock him as a coward who dared not face the exam, disgracing Dan Sect—something Luo Tian would never allow.

"So I'll have to fight step by step! Damn it, Refining Body Nine Stages!" Luo Tian sighed bitterly.

Yet Luo Tian had his own advantage. Zhang Dao Yi would likely fight as before, feigning restraint before striking suddenly. Moreover, Luo Tian had already fought four matches and taken pills to recover, though his strength was still diminished.

Realizing this, Luo Tian no longer held back. He launched a Blazing Dragon Hand immediately. The Refining Body Six Stages Luo Tian was no longer comparable to his former Refining Body Four Stages.

The fire dragon materialized as a tangible force, radiating terrifying heat. It lunged at Zhang Dao Yi with feral intent.

Zhang Dao Yi hadn't expected Luo Tian to use a Yellow-Rank Martial Art so early. He hesitated, and in that moment, the fire dragon reached him.

"Whoosh..." The fire dragon collided with Zhang Dao Yi's body, sending him stumbling back two steps.

A scent of charred hair filled the air. Though Zhang Dao Yi suffered no fatal injuries, his head was now entirely blackened from not guarding his hair in time.

"Ha! Ha!" A laugh erupted from the crowd below.

The people laughed while secretly marveling at Luo Tian's audacity. He'd used a Yellow-Rank Martial Art right from the start, giving Zhang Dao Yi no chance to close in.

Zhang Dao Yi's face flushed with anger—whether feigned or genuine, he howled and rushed toward Luo Tian.

But before reaching Luo Tian's side, a radiant golden seal descended from Zhang Dao Yi's head and smashed down.

Zhang Dao Yi sneered: "Hmph! The first time I was caught off guard; I won't let you succeed again!"

A golden spiritual energy shield materialized instantly above Zhang Dao Yi's head, attempting to block Luo Tian's Human King Seal.

"Crash... Crack..." The sound of breaking echoed. Though the shield didn't fully block the Human King Seal, its remaining power posed no threat to Zhang Dao Yi.

Luo Tian sighed inwardly at the strength of Refining Body Nine Stages but kept adjusting his strategy. A series of terrifying spiritual energy fluctuations emanated from his hands—Luo Tian's secret technique, the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Human King Seal.

Finally, a colorless spiritual energy seal vanished from Luo Tian's hands, reappearing instantly above Zhang Dao Yi.

Feeling the terrifying power, Zhang Dao Yi halted mid-charge and barked: "Four Golden Palms!"

Four palms met the Human King Seal head-on. To ensure safety, Zhang Dao Yi conjured three more spiritual energy shields above his head.

"Boom..." The seal crashed down. Luo Tian's Five Elements Mutual Generation Human King Seal, at Refining Body Six Stages, now posed a significant threat to Refining Body Nine Stages. The cost was nearly half his spiritual energy, no longer leaving him depleted as before.

After the deafening sound, dust swirled into the air. Cracks spread across the arena.

The crowd watched Luo Tian with fervor. To see a Refining Body Six Stages disciple so thoroughly defeat a Refining Body Nine Stages opponent was unprecedented.

" I want to bear his child!" A bold female disciple shouted.

"Fool! Show some restraint. Your hips are so small, how can you bear a child?" Her companion mocked.

After mocking her companion, she shouted again in the crowd's stunned gaze: "Luo Tian, my hips are big! I want to bear your child!"

The crowd glanced at the two women's hips, swallowing hard: "They really are big!"

Gu Qianxue overheard their shouts and muttered a curse, thinking them shameless. Yet she subconsciously touched her hips, feeling their firmness before relaxing and watching the match.

"Five Elements Body! Truly terrifying. If this boy grows strong, he'll ensure our Five Elements Sect's safety for a millennium!" Fire Peak Leader Si Tuan'le murmured.

Other peak leaders nodded in agreement, clearly approving of Si Tuan'le's assessment.

"Still stronger than me!" Zhang Hongyun sighed, his confidence shaken after being outmatched by Luo Tian. The consecutive defeats had left him with a hint of inferiority.

"Don't let this defeat rob you of confidence. If you lose it now, you'll forever be a mere background character!" Gold Light Peak Leader said calmly.

Zhang Hongyun's body jolted. After pondering, his confidence returned to his eyes as he bowed respectfully to the Gold Light Peak Leader.

"From now on, your opponent is you!" Feng Qianyu gazed at Luo Tian with fervor, as if finding a new toy.

Water and Fire Peak Leaders had returned to the viewing platform unnoticed. They seemed to have reached an agreement, obviously deciding Feng Qianyu's fate. Upon hearing Feng Qianyu's words, their eyes showed relief.

"Indeed, I've long wanted to test you!" Yang Huanyu, clad in black, stood beside Huang Jingshan of the Thick Earth Sect.

Hearing Yang Huanyu's words, Huang Jingshan was stunned. He hadn't expected this person to regard Luo Tian as a rival—this signified high praise for Luo Tian!

"Truly, you've outmatched me, little brother!" Zhang Dao Yi sneered, emphasizing the "little brother" part.

Luo Tian feigned innocence: "Senior Brother, your strength is formidable. I admire you deeply!"

The dust cleared, revealing Zhang Dao Yi's battered form—no longer the confident figure he'd been. He looked worse than a beggar on the street.

"Guess you've no spiritual energy left, Five Elements Body. Using so many martial arts and still having energy!" Zhang Dao Yi's cold voice echoed, his slight remorse now gone. He decided to fight with all his might.

With that thought, Zhang Dao Yi's form flickered toward Luo Tian again. His golden fist, fueled by anger, smashed toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 39: Zhang Dao Yi's Death

"Rupture Sky Spear!" Luo Tian murmured, and a dark spear materialized in his hand.

Without hesitation, the glinting spear tip stabbed toward Zhang Dao Yi's fist.

A piercing sound echoed, causing the crowd's ears to ring.

"What is this spear? It wounded me!" Zhang Dao Yi felt his fist's pain, exclaiming in shock.

"A spear capable of wounding a Refining Body Nine Stages opponent! This spear must be at least Yellow-Rank!" The crowd marveled at Luo Tian holding the spear.

Luo Tian had consistently surprised them. First, his Human King Seal forced Zhang Dao Yi into such a desperate state and even wounded him. Then came this spear, seemingly superior to Yellow-Rank.

From the moment Luo Tian fought, he'd never been at a disadvantage. In contrast, Zhang Dao Yi, despite his Refining Body Nine Stages strength, had been constantly on the defensive.

Though people still doubted Luo Tian's chances, to defeat a Refining Body Nine Stages opponent with his Refining Body Six Stages was unprecedented.

"Yet it's only a wound. The result remains unchanged!" Zhang Dao Yi wiped the blood from his fist, murmuring.

"Seven Stars Golden Dragon Fist!" Zhang Dao Yi roared, his form shifting. Shadows dispersed from his body.

Instantly, seven Zhang Dao Yis appeared as if real, raising their fists to strike Luo Tian.

Luo Tian realized Zhang Dao Yi had now fought seriously. His eyes flashed with madness: "Golden Snake Wild Dance!"

A flurry of spear shadows transformed into golden snakes, their jaws wide as they coiled around the seven Zhang Dao Yis. Luo Tian decided to fight with all his might, no longer holding back—otherwise, he'd suffer greatly. The Five Elements Mutual Generation power subtly activated; the golden snakes lunged violently, their fangs clearly visible.

"Crash... Crash... Crash!" Seven resounding explosions echoed.

"Defeated! He actually defeated Zhang Dao Yi's Seven Stars Golden Dragon Fist?" Kong Deming couldn't believe it. He hadn't expected even himself to handle this technique, yet Luo Tian had.

Zhang Dao Yi also hadn't anticipated Luo Tian's strength. He'd planned to "accidentally" kill him with this move, but his eyes showed disbelief.

Yet seeing the swirling dust and Luo Tian's weakened state, Zhang Dao Yi's face twisted with cruelty. He rushed to Luo Tian's side and aimed a palm at his dantian.

"Die!" From the depths of Dan Sect, Zhang Ziping's eyes flashed with murder. He flicked a fingernail-sized stone like a meteor toward the arena.

Luo Tian sensed Zhang Dao Yi's approach and felt an ominous premonition. He knew Zhang Dao Yi was about to abandon subtlety and strike directly.

"Stop!" Kong Deming shouted, rushing toward the arena. At that moment, Zhang Dao Yi's palm was nearly at Luo Tian's dantian.

"Idiot!" Lei Yonghua transformed into lightning, rushing toward the arena. Yet he was too late.

In an instant, a faint whistling sound pierced through the air and reached Zhang Dao Yi's front.

Zhang Dao Yi felt a chill at his forehead before losing consciousness. Yet he remained in the position of striking Luo Tian's dantian, his eyes filled with intense regret. Just a little more—only a little more—and he would have succeeded!

The dust cleared, and Lei Yonghua reached Luo Tian's side, helping him up. Kong Deming was drenched in sweat. If anything happened to Luo Tian, no one in Five Elements Sect could withstand Dan Sect's wrath.

"Ah..." Meanwhile, a figure rushed onto another arena. Seeing Zhang Dao Yi's corpse, he howled toward the back of Dan Sect: "Dan Sect! Zhang Ziping! I want an explanation!"

"Huang Tianxiao, you truly deserve your name. All you do is howl at the sky. An explanation? I'll give you one!" Lei Yonghua's cold voice echoed.

Ji Chen also stared at the old man with icy eyes, a wave of killing intent radiating from his body.

"Explanation! I'll give you an explanation! Do you want me to explain it to you?!" Lei Yonghua suddenly rushed toward Huang Tianxiao, a streak of lightning surrounding his fist as he smashed it into Huang Tianxiao's face. Ji Chen transformed into a wisp of black smoke, approaching Huang Tianxiao as well.

Huang Tianxiao, though also in the Bone-Refining Stage, was only at the middle stage due to his old age. Lei Yonghua, though also Bone-Refining Middle Stage, had a rare lightning attribute—no match for Huang Tianxiao.

Huang Tianxiao was knocked back several feet by Lei Yonghua's punch. Lei Yonghua had clearly lost his temper. Fortunately, Zhang Ziping arrived in time; otherwise, Luo Tian would have died under his nose, and how could he face his master?

Similarly, Ji Chen was furious. His fists wrapped in black spiritual energy struck Huang Tianxiao relentlessly, with wisps of black mist seeping into his skin with each hit.

Huang Tianxiao was stunned. He hadn't expected two people to dare beat another peak's elder, especially since he was the brother of Thick Earth Sect Leader.

"Stop!" Huang Jingshan finally couldn't bear it, his face darkened. His spiritual power of the Soul-Formation Stage pressed upon Lei Yonghua and Ji Chen.

Seeing Huang Jingshan's words, Lei Yonghua and Ji Chen stopped. Yet they still glared at Huang Tianxiao.

"Tianxiao, what's going on? What relationship do you have with this Zhang Dao Yi?" Huang Jingshan glared at his unambitious brother.

"He's my disciple! My only one!" Huang Tianxiao cried, speaking for a long time despite being beaten. Though battered, he spoke clearly—people marveled at the strength of Bone-Refining Stage; being beaten so severely yet still speaking was impressive.

At that moment, the crowd had stopped the exam. Everyone focused on this arena. Actually, everything happened in an instant. Even those watching the match hadn't noticed anything until Huang Jingshan's cry for Zhang Ziping to explain, then seeing Lei Yonghua and Ji Chen beating Huang Tianxiao.

Hearing it involved Zhang Dao Yi, their eyes swept to the already dead Zhang Dao Yi. They were shocked—unbelievable that Zhang Dao Yi was dead, and when he died wasn't known. However, linking Huang Tianxiao's call to Zhang Ziping, they guessed who had acted.

As people figured out who had acted, Huang Tianxiao explained his relationship with Zhang Dao Yi. People then understood.

Originally, when Zhang Dao Yi entered Five Elements Sect's outer sect, Huang Tianxiao had noticed him. Since Huang Tianxiao was in Thick Earth Sect and most of his sect's disciples had earth attributes, but he himself had a gold attribute. Thus, he sought disciples from the outer sect and found Zhang Dao Yi.

Zhang Dao Yi agreed willingly. He promised to become Huang Tianxiao's disciple after entering the inner sect. However, he encountered Luo Tian and was killed by Zhang Ziping.

"Brother! I've lived half my life, and finally found a disciple. But Zhang Ziping killed him! You must help me!" Huang Tianxiao, an old man, cried like a child, making people laugh.

Huang Jingshan frowned. This matter was Zhang Dao Yi's fault, but Lei Yonghua and Ji Chen had beaten his brother in front of him. That was too embarrassing.

"You Dan Sect is arrogant, but you must be reasonable. Lei Yonghua and Ji Chen, you beat another peak's elder in public. That's too disrespectful of the sect rules. Today I, as peak leader, will discipline Zhang Ziping's disciple!" Huang Jingshan coldly stared at Lei Yonghua and Ji Chen.

"Ah, you can't beat us? So you use sect rules to suppress us? I'll see who dares touch us today!" Lei Yonghua chuckled, challenging Huang Jingshan.

Chapter 40: Enmity

"Hmph. You Dan Sect is so arrogant!" Huang Jingshan's dissatisfaction grew, his eyes turning cold. He was the Thick Earth Sect Leader, a Soul-Formation Stage powerhouse. Yet he had been rebuked by a Bone-Refining Stage disciple, which was unbearable for Thick Earth Sect's dignity.

"Whether you're arrogant or not, I know you can't touch them!" Zhang Ziping's voice echoed, accompanied by the aura of Soul-Formation Stage, arriving before Luo Tian and his companions.

"Zhang Ziping, don't forget your seniority. You spoke to me like that?" Huang Jingshan's face darkened.

"Senior? Do you have a single bit of seniority? I'd rather not have such shameless seniors!" Zhang Ziping didn't even glance at Huang Jingshan, extending his spiritual energy to replenish Luo Tian's weakened state.

"You!" Huang Jingshan was speechless.

"I'll teach you both as well!" Huang Jingshan's face darkened, his anger fully ignited by Zhang Ziping's disregard.

"Good! If you want to fight, fight!" Zhang Ziping calmly smiled but unleashed a surge of power toward Huang Jingshan.

"Soul-Formation Late Stage!" When Zhang Ziping's aura spread, the peak leaders' faces showed disbelief. They hadn't expected Zhang Ziping to be so powerful, catching up with them.

"How did he cultivate?" They wondered in their hearts.

"Soul-Formation Late Stage!" Huang Jingshan's eyes widened. He was only at Soul-Formation Middle Stage, yet Zhang Ziping, just thirty-two years old, had reached Soul-Formation Late Stage. He'd last seen him two years ago at Soul-Formation Early Stage—only two years! What a person!

"Are you still determined to discipline me?" Zhang Ziping teased, his eyes flicking up at Huang Jingshan.

Huang Jingshan was in a difficult position. Being confronted by a junior like this, he'd assumed Zhang Ziping was still at Soul-Formation Early Stage. Even if he couldn't defeat him, he could suppress him. Who would have thought this变态 had become Soul-Formation Late Stage! Now it was likely himself who'd be beaten.

"You beat my Thick Earth Sect's elder, violating the sect rules. Don't you owe me an explanation?" Huang Jingshan switched tactics after failing to fight.

"Disciple, today is your first day in Dan Sect. I'll teach you how to deal with such shameless seniors. Only by being stronger can they stop calling you names. If you忍气吞声, they'll call even louder!" Zhang Ziping smiled at Luo Tian.

After speaking, he turned back to Huang Jingshan with a deep gaze: "You can't fight? Now you're talking about rules again. If you want an explanation, I'll give it! From now on, for ten years, no Dan Sect alchemists will provide a single pill to Thick Earth Sect! Huang Jingshan, this is my explanation!"

"You! Zhang Ziping, don't be too overbearing. Dan Sect isn't yours alone! You have no right to do this!" Huang Jingshan scoffed.

"Twenty years!" Zhang Ziping ignored Huang Jingshan's scoff, coldly extending the ten years to twenty.

Huang Jingshan crossed his arms, mocking Zhang Ziping's boldness. Cutting off a sect's pills was only the Dan Sect Master's authority. The old Dan Sect Master hadn't been in Five Elements Sect for years, and Zhang Ziping had no right to do this. Yet the scene that followed made him want to slap himself.

Huang Jingshan saw Zhang Ziping holding a white jade-like pill token in his hand, which he hadn't noticed before. He tossed it into the air, emitting a brilliant light.

At the same time, all eight thousand Dan Sect disciples on the mountain heard Zhang Ziping's authoritative voice.

"Respect the Master's decree!" All eight thousand disciples bowed slightly, their voices echoing across Five Elements Sect.

"Dan Master's Token!" The peak leaders' faces darkened, watching Zhang Ziping. They hadn't expected the old Dan Sect Master to entrust this token to Zhang Ziping. The Dan Master's Token represented the Dan Sect Master's identity, and now it was on Zhang Ziping—making him the de facto Dan Sect Master.

Huang Jingshan's face paled. He knew that with the Dan Master's Token, Dan Sect disciples must obey the Dan Sect Master. From now on, Thick Earth Sect would lose pill support, inevitably declining.

Luo Tian watched Zhang Ziping's boldness and smiled: this was his brother, willing to fight with a sect over a disciple who hadn't even joined Dan Sect yet. At this moment, Luo Tian felt a sense of belonging to Dan Sect.

"My explanation is given. Now tell me what you'll give me in return. My disciple was nearly killed by this man, and he's about to join your Thick Earth Sect? What explanation do you give me? Don't you think Dan Sect has no one?" Zhang Ziping's voice carried a slight aura toward Huang Jingshan and Huang Tianxiao.

Hearing Zhang Ziping's words, the peak leaders' mouths twitched. Who didn't know Five Elements Sect's Dan Sect was most special, protective, and arrogant? Huang Jingshan had only wanted to regain face by cutting off their pills for twenty years. Twenty years! They could already imagine Thick Earth Sect becoming the weakest among the peaks.

"What are you two causing trouble for?" The Grandmaster Wei Mingxuan's voice echoed, his face dark as he arrived at the arena.

"Grandmaster!" Everyone on the square, including Zhang Ziping, bowed respectfully.

"Trouble! Go do your own things!" Wei Mingxuan looked at Zhang Ziping's Soul-Formation Late Stage aura, his eyes showing no reprimand but rather satisfaction.

The peak leaders sighed. The Grandmaster was too lenient toward Dan Sect, even if the mistake was on Thick Earth Sect. Cutting off their pills for twenty years was indeed excessive.

Huang Jingshan saw the Grandmaster arrive but didn't mention Thick Earth Sect's pill cut. He clearly intended to ignore it.

Huang Jingshan's eyes flashed with resentment, glancing at Luo Tian and his three companions before leaving the crowd with Yang Huanyu. Gold Light Peak Leader also led Zhang Hongyun out, while Water and Fire Peaks' leaders took Feng Qianyu out.

"Let's go too!" Mu Nianqing called to Gu Qianxue.

"Luo Tian, I'm leaving. Take care! Remember to visit me at Qingmu Sect. If you don't, you're dead!" Gu Qianxue waved her fist at Luo Tian, eyes filled with reluctance as she followed Mu Nianqing out of the crowd.

Luo Tian smiled helplessly, waving to Gu Qianxue.

As peak leaders left, people snapped out of their stupor.

Everyone gazed at Luo Tian with admiration. The first to ascend the 999th level of the Ascending Stairs, defeating a Refining Body Nine Stages opponent with his Refining Body Six Stages, forcing the opponent to reveal all strategies yet still failing. Because of him, Thick Earth Sect lost twenty years of pills, nearly causing two peak leaders to clash. Consecutive days had seen the Grandmaster intervene—this was Luo Tian's achievement.

"Ah... Dan Sect is one变态 after another!" People marveled at Dan Sect's strength and overprotectiveness, fantasizing about joining it. Who wouldn't want to join such a secure sect? Immediately, the recruitment officers for Dan Sect's outer disciples were busy.

Chapter 41: Gu Lei's Initiation

After the peak leaders left, only Luo Tian and his three companions remained at the arena's edge.

Besides Luo Tian and his three companions, Wu Ping'an stood with a grim face. Watching all peak leaders leave with success, he had no disciple to recruit—Huang Jingshan had effortlessly lured Yang Huanyu away. He felt a bit闷, but thinking of Huang Jingshan's later situation, Wu Ping'an felt slightly better.

"Let's go too! Senior Brother will take you for the final exam!" Zhang Ziping's voice echoed, addressing Luo Tian and his three companions.

"Ha! Luo Tian, I'm now a Five Elements Sect outer disciple too. From now on, look up to me!" Gu Lei's loud laughter approached Luo Tian, his gaze filled with admiration toward Zhang Ziping.

Luo Tian smiled, watching Gu Lei's plump figure. He felt a touch of nostalgia; they had spent the most time together, and their bond was strongest.

"Decided which sect to join?" Luo Tian smiled.

"Of course Dan Sect's outer disciples! My dream was becoming a renowned alchemist across the continent. With you in Dan Sect, I can walk proudly!" Gu Lei patted Luo Tian's shoulder.

Luo Tian nodded inwardly. Gu Lei had remarkable talent in alchemy, already at the third-grade alchemist level—not too brilliant but a standout. He was also glad they hadn't been separated much.

"Hmm?" Wu Pingan let out a soft sound, wrinkling his nose. He looked at Gu Lei with interest.

"Boy? Have you ever been poisoned by the Seven-Stage Devouring Poison?" Wu Pingan asked softly.

Gu Lei, seeing this old man was a peak leader, dared not be disrespectful. He bowed: "Disciple indeed has been poisoned by it."

After speaking, Gu Lei looked at Luo Tian, recalling how he had risked everything to enter Xuantian City for him. His eyes showed gratitude.

"Strange, strange. Though he took a bone-refining pill, the Seven-Stage Devouring Poison's toxicity is so fierce. This young man seems unaffected at all?" Wu Pingan pondered.

Soon, Wu Pingan's face brightened. He thought of a possibility, his eyes flashing with excitement as he stared at Gu Lei.

Gu Lei felt uneasy under the old man's gaze. If not for his status as a Soul-Formation powerhouse, he would have cursed: "What the hell are you staring at? I don't find you attractive."

But Gu Lei only thought it internally, his body instinctively moving closer to Zhang Ziping.

"Boy, would you like to be my disciple?" Wu Pingan's eyes burned with intensity toward Gu Lei.

Gu Lei was stunned, his mind filled with dread: "Um... if I join your sect, can I learn alchemy?"

"Alchemy? What's the use of learning it? I'll teach you my secret techniques, making you one of the top warriors in the world!" Wu Pingan confidently said.

"No! I just want to be an alchemist!" Gu Lei showed no interest, bowing slightly.

"What?

Wu Pingan had expected Gu Lei to respectfully kneel and accept him as a master. But after hearing Gu Lei's words, he was furious.

"Damn it! What day is this? Why am I being rejected by two young men!" Wu Pingan was furious, truly angry. He was the Tian Du Sect's peak leader, a renowned figure in the Northern Region. Anyone who opened their mouth to recruit would come running. Today, two young men had rejected him in a row.

"Boy! You have to accept me today! Zhang Ziping, this favor you must give me!" Wu Pingan said, his face twisted as he grabbed Gu Lei and flew off the arena with wings spread.

"I just want to be an alchemist!" Gu Lei's lament echoed from afar.

"Hmph! From now on, you're my sole disciple. Don't think about alchemy again. If you do, I'll erase your spiritual awareness!" Zhang Ziping's voice followed, leaving Luo Tian and his two brothers stunned.

"This!" Luo Tian's eyes showed worry, watching the distant figure.

"Don't worry. This boy's body type is special; it suits being Wu Pingan's disciple." Zhang Ziping smiled, reassuring Luo Tian.

Hearing Zhang Ziping's words, Luo Tian's heart relaxed. He sighed inwardly, realizing his strength was still insufficient. Otherwise, none of these events would have happened. He yearned for power more than ever.

If he had strength, he wouldn't have to sneak out of Xuantian City carefully. He wouldn't have nearly been killed by Zhang Dao Yi on the arena. His brother wouldn't have offended Thick Earth Sect. He wouldn't have watched Gu Lei be forcibly taken and made a disciple, though it was beneficial for Gu Lei. Yet Luo Tian wished Gu Lei could choose his own path.

"Strength! Strength! One day, I'll no longer need protection but protect those I care about and live happily. From now on, this is my dream!" Luo Tian clenched his fist, vowing inwardly.

Hearing Zhang Ziping's call, Luo Tian followed his three brothers toward the next exam location, the Questioning Heart Hall.

With this, all peak leaders had selected their desired disciples. The remaining nearly a thousand participants were no longer their concern.

...

Luo Tian followed Zhang Ziping, marveling at how vast Five Elements Sect was. He had stayed in Feiyun and lived in Tianyuan City, but neither place combined was as large as one of Five Elements Sect's main peaks.

At the Questioning Heart Hall, the group arrived at a grand hall. Zhang Ziping greeted Luo Tian and Lei Yonghua before leaving.

This third test had no difficulty, no life-threatening danger. It merely verified if the disciples had any hidden hostility toward the sect and their character. Zhang Ziping didn't worry about Luo Tian's safety.

After all, as a true disciple, strict checks were necessary. As for outer and inner disciples, Five Elements Sect didn't care. After all, such a large sect couldn't avoid having one or two disloyal individuals—though they weren't in important positions.

Luo Tian nodded to Lei Yonghua and walked into the Questioning Heart Hall.

"Unknown what my little brother truly desires," Gu Lei mused, watching Luo Tian's back as he entered the hall. He recalled his own experience entering the Questioning Heart Hall.

As soon as Luo Tian entered, darkness enveloped him. He instinctively extended his spiritual awareness outward but could only reach a few feet—far less than the hundreds of feet he was used to. The spiritual awareness consumption was massive, and even that short distance revealed only darkness.

Luo Tian sighed, relying on his vision to move forward cautiously. Though he knew the Questioning Heart Hall posed no danger, facing endless darkness made him instinctively alert.

Chapter 42: Illusion

Luo Tian had no idea how long he walked. He saw what seemed to be a bridge ahead but couldn't see the other side.

As he stepped onto the wooden bridge, he felt a pressure. A strange sound echoed. He listened carefully; though odd, it wasn't unpleasant. But after a while, his expression changed—too late.

Luo Tian felt a wave of weakness, a hint of fatigue. His eyes grew hazy, and his eyelids felt like weights. He struggled to keep them open but succumbed as the strange sound reached his ears, collapsing on the bridge in this dark space.

Luo Tian felt as if he had entered another world, existing as a soul in this realm.
