But this background-rich young man clearly lacked such awareness. Once he started speaking, it was impossible to stop him.

"Uncle Zheng, why didn't you come with your sect's people? Why did you come alone to this Storm and Thunder Platform?" Luo Tian finally understood Zheng Xin's true nature. This man truly had no fear of being interrupted; no matter what question you asked, he could always weave his own story to answer.

"Ah... why did I come alone? It's a long story, really. It's all because of my old man..." Zheng Xin began recounting his tale with vivid enthusiasm, explaining why he had come to the Storm and Thunder Platform.

Luo Tian forced himself to endure the torment of his ears, extracting key points from Zheng Xin's endless chatter.

It turned out that all sects' recruitment processes included their masters' children as well, who had to undergo the same trials. This was a test for them, after all; these masters' offspring would inevitably hold high positions within their sects. To earn the respect of others, they had to compete on equal footing with ordinary disciples—some even faced stricter standards than common initiates.

Luo Tian stopped listening here, but Zheng Xin remained indifferent. He felt an inexplicable connection with this young man, especially since the latter's eyes were always filled with smiles. Listening to him speak felt like encountering a soulmate.

If Luo Tian had known Zheng Xin's thoughts, he would have cursed aloud: "Who the hell are you to call me a soulmate? I'd have slapped you into next week if I wasn't wary of your connection to the Wind-Blade Valley!"

Luo Tian maintained a stiff smile as Zheng Xin's ceaseless chatter led them to the thousand-zhang-high, thousand-zhang-long Storm and Thunder Platform—the destination of Luo Tian's journey.

At that moment, the platform was already crowded with people. Yet anyone who encountered Zheng Xin kept their distance.

Given Zheng Xin's status, these people should have been eager to flatter him—but no one dared approach. They all seemed to avoid a grim reaper, watching him with wary eyes. Clearly, Zheng Xin's notorious reputation had already spread among them.

"Zheng Xin, it's been over a year since we last met. You're still as unconventional as ever!" A teasing voice rang out from the crowd, drawing both Zheng Xin and Luo Tian's attention.

Chapter 343: Cold Autumn Cicada Arrives

Chapter 343: Cold Autumn Cicada Arrives

"Ah... Duan Xingchen? It's been a long time! I remember our last meeting was..." Upon hearing the voice, Zheng Xin lit up like he'd found a new world. His eyes gleamed as he approached a young man behind whom was a long sword.

Luo Tian exhaled softly, his body trembling involuntarily. He silently cursed Zheng Xin's terrifying loquacity; he felt certain that if this continued, he'd go mad.

Seeing someone rescue him from Zheng Xin's chatter, Luo Tian wore an expression of relief. His gaze followed the direction Zheng Xin had gone.

A youth in gray robes, carrying a long sword on his back, wore an amused expression as he watched Zheng Xin.

"Sky-Sword Sect?" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly, deducing the youth was a disciple of the Sky-Sword Sect from his attire.

Luo Tian's face bore a cautious expression. He had previously clashed with the Sky-Sword Sect, and this youth clearly held status within it—perhaps even on par with Zheng Xin. That meant he could be the son of the Sky-Sword Sect's master or another important figure.

"Stop... Zheng Xin, I don't know you well. I just came over to greet you. We've only met a few times, right?" Duan Xingchen naturally knew Zheng Xin's most terrifying trait and quickly interrupted him.

"Ahh... Brother Xingchen, one meeting makes two acquaintances, right? After all, we're old friends. Let's find a place to sit and chat for three days and nights—wouldn't that be delightful!" Zheng Xin, however, seemed to have no limits, moving closer.

Duan Xingchen saw Zheng Xin approaching and instinctively drew his sword from his back. The last time he met Zheng Xin, he hadn't known his nature and was dragged into a conversation that turned into an agonizing half-day.

Now, seeing Zheng Xin again, Duan Xingchen couldn't tolerate him. As Zheng Xin approached, he unleashed his mid-stage Bone Transcendence cultivation and drew his sword threateningly: "Zheng Xin, if you come any closer, I'll attack!"

"Whirr..." The sword emitted a faint white light in Duan Xingchen's hand, radiating an overwhelming aura toward Zheng Xin.

"Ahh... Brother Xingchen, why so violent? If you have any grievances with me, just say it. Let's sit down and talk!" Zheng Xin halted mid-step, wearing an indifferent expression as he took another cautious step forward.

Luo Tian's face tensed slightly when Duan Xingchen drew his sword. He could sense the terrifying aura within this seemingly ordinary blade.

It wasn't just Luo Tian who noticed the sword's simplicity; almost everyone on the Storm and Thunder Platform blinked in surprise, turning their gazes toward Duan Xingchen and Zheng Xin.

"That's Duan Xingchen, the son of the Sky-Sword Sect's master!" someone exclaimed.

"It really is Duan Xingchen! Legends say he was born with falling stars, granting him the rare Starry Body. His sword, the Starry Sword, was crafted by the Sky-Sword Sect's master using meteorites from across the Eastern Lands!" people murmured, their faces filled with admiration.

"Zheng Xin shows no fear of Duan Xingchen's aura, continuing to walk forward—clearly another audacious soul!" Luo Tian marveled at the murmurs, silently praising how talent flourished in the Eastern Lands.

Starry Body—Luo Tian had never heard of it in the Northern Lands, yet here he saw it.

"This Zheng Xin may be a bit eccentric, but his Wind Attribute Body is rare and exceptional!" people loudly commented, their words reaching Luo Tian's ears.

Though these details weren't a secret in the Eastern Lands' Kunlun Mountains, they were new to Luo Tian.

"Looks like these two are about to fight here!" a young man in the crowd mused, watching the approaching figures.

"Roar..." A piercing wolf howl echoed in their ears, followed by a terrifying aura that drew everyone's attention to the distance.

"Both of you, fight far away—don't disgrace this place!" a cold voice rang out from the crowd.

A figure cloaked in black silk emerged, her elegant form moving through the crowd with an icy aura.

A blue wolf-shaped beast, its eyes glowing fiercely and white fangs bared, sent shivers down the spine. No one doubted that even a Bone Transcendence Stage Nine powerhouse would be shredded in an instant by those fangs.

Luo Tian saw the black-cloaked figure and smiled faintly, that smile one of reunion.

"Ahh... Autumn Cicada sister, it's been a long time! Do you remember me? I'm Zheng Xin—we met at our last gathering..." Upon hearing the cold voice, Zheng Xin finally halted, his face wearing a habitual smile as he turned to greet her, once again unleashing his unstoppable chatter.

"Go away..." Cold Autumn Cicada's voice echoed, even Zheng Xin hesitated slightly before falling silent.

"Autumn Cicada, it's been a while!" Duan Xingchen smiled warmly, sheathing his Starry Sword and approaching Cold Autumn Cicada.

"Stop..." When Duan Xingchen was two zhang away, Cold Autumn Cicada spoke, causing his smile to stiffen.

The atmosphere grew awkward as Cold Autumn Cicada's arrival instantly darkened the Storm and Thunder Platform.

"Such a long time without seeing you, this girl is still as cold as ever! But her cultivation has definitely improved—she's now at the mid-stage Bone Transcendence!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, remaining among the crowd. His appearance had changed, so Cold Autumn Cicada couldn't recognize him.

But just because she didn't recognize him didn't mean others wouldn't.

At that moment, Cold Autumn Cicada's blue wolf-shaped beast sniffed the air, its face showing a human-like suspicion. Its cold gaze turned toward Luo Tian's direction, slowly approaching him.

"Trouble!"

Luo Tian's heart lurched. The wolf-shaped beast was none other than the blue little wolf he'd found in a cave's spatial realm. He hadn't expected it to have grown so large, and its strength had already reached the early stage of Bone Transcendence.

But Luo Tian suddenly realized something: beasts' senses and olfactory abilities were far superior to humans. This little wolf, still not fully awakened in intelligence, might instantly expose him.

"Don't come closer... don't come closer..." Luo Tian's eyes trembled as the little wolf approached.

"Hmm?" Cold Autumn Cicada's beautiful eyes flickered with interest, gazing toward the little wolf.

Chapter 344: Kick Him Away

Chapter 344: Kick Him Away

"Little wolf, what's wrong?" Cold Autumn Cicada's voice echoed in her mind, a series of strange words emerging from beneath her black veil.

Hearing Cold Autumn Cicada's question, the blue little wolf halted its steps and growled softly in response.

Luo Tian heard this human-beast conversation, his heart drumming. Right now in Kunlun Mountains, if he exposed his identity, the Sky-Sword Sect would immediately descend upon him. He had no chance of escape.

But what eased his mind was that Cold Autumn Cicada merely blinked, her face still puzzled, and didn't stop the little wolf from moving forward.

As Cold Autumn Cicada's gaze fell, people turned their eyes toward the little wolf, curious about what this beast was up to.

Pushing through the crowd, the little wolf finally saw Luo Tian's presence. Its eyes showed confusion, as if pondering something, hesitating to approach.

Luo Tian felt a sense of relief; it seemed this little wolf might not recognize him either. When he first met it, the little wolf was just born. Thinking this, Luo Tian relaxed.

People's gazes finally landed on Luo Tian. Seeing the blue wolf-shaped beast stop before him, they speculated who this youth was and what made Cold Autumn Cicada's little wolf so interested in him.

"Roar..." The little wolf seemed to have made a decision, leaping forward with a powerful kick toward Luo Tian.

"Be careful!" Zheng Xin's face showed concern; he truly cared for this new friend.

Zheng Xin naturally sensed Luo Tian was only at the Bone Transcendence Stage Nine, though his body's fluctuations were stronger than most. But he didn't believe Luo Tian could escape the wolf-shaped beast's claws.

"Quickly, I'll block the blue little wolf!" Zheng Xin rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Whirr..." An energy fluctuation emerged from Cold Autumn Cicada's feet, and the Sealing Heaven Step immediately activated, blocking Zheng Xin.

"Nothing's wrong!" Cold Autumn Cicada coldly spoke to Zheng Xin.

"Hmm?" Zheng Xin's eyes narrowed slightly, glancing at Cold Autumn Cicada. He knew his own speed—being a Wind Attribute Body and with reinforced bone marrow, he was faster than most. Yet Cold Autumn Cicada had blocked him effortlessly, leaving him astonished.

"The Sealing Heaven Step's fourth stage?" Duan Xingchen's eyes narrowed, his face showing excitement as he recognized Cold Autumn Cicada's martial art.

Duan Xingchen was the son of the Sky-Sword Sect's master, blessed with unique advantages within his sect. He had been captivated by Cold Autumn Cicada two years ago and repeatedly begged his father to propose to the Yuleng Sect.

When Duan Chenfeng saw his son was truly infatuated with Cold Autumn Cicada, he agreed. Cold Autumn Cicada's talent was no less than Duan Xingchen's—her dual attributes of darkness and wood made her a perfect match. With the Yuleng Sect's strength and heritage, it was stronger than the Sky-Sword Sect by a slight margin. Duan Chenfeng naturally agreed wholeheartedly.

But he hadn't expected that when they went to propose, the Yuleng Sect's master didn't refuse but also didn't accept. He valued Cold Autumn Cicada's opinion, so he wanted them to spend time together. However, Cold Autumn Cicada had run away instead.

"The Sealing Heaven Step's fourth stage? Ah, Autumn Cicada sister truly has outstanding talent! I remember the last time..." Zheng Xin was momentarily stunned before resuming his endless chatter.

"The Sealing Heaven Step's fourth stage—this is a grade-level martial art of the Yuleng Sect. I didn't expect Autumn Cicada, so young, to have reached the fourth stage. Such talent is truly terrifying!" people marveled at Cold Autumn Cicada.

"Go away..." Cold Autumn Cicada's brows furrowed slightly, clearly having experienced Zheng Xin's endless chatter. She retreated, gazing toward Luo Tian.

Cold Autumn Cicada didn't know why, but she was certain she had never met this man. Yet an indescribable feeling lingered in her heart, especially after hearing the little wolf's hint that it felt familiar with Luo Tian. She now wanted to know who this youth was.

"Roar..." Luo Tian saw the little wolf rushing toward him and sighed inwardly: "Sorry, little one. I'll make it up to you later!"

With a swift kick, Luo Tian struck the little wolf's abdomen. The beast flew backward like a blue lightning bolt, howling in pain before landing on the ground—though it suffered no real harm.

Luo Tian's kick was perfectly timed, within the little wolf's tolerance. After all, he knew Cold Autumn Cicada's terrifying strength and that this was Kunlun Mountains. He couldn't afford to offend her.

"Whirr..." A strong energy fluctuation radiated from Cold Autumn Cicada, a cold aura locking onto Luo Tian.

"Ha ha... Autumn Cicada sister, I forgot to introduce you! This is my new brother, Luolei. You should look after him from now on! Let me tell you, I've never met such a compatible brother in my life. We hit it off instantly... no, the first was your Yuleng Sect's Jiang Nanxuan..." Zheng Xin stepped forward, patting Luo Tian's shoulder.

Seeing Zheng Xin's action, Luo Tian felt a warmth in his heart. He could tell Zheng Xin was trying to protect him; after all, he had just kicked Cold Autumn Cicada's little wolf. If someone more arrogant had done this, they'd have been dealt with.

In Zheng Xin's eyes, Cold Autumn Cicada was clearly that kind of person. He didn't want his new friend to be beaten up by her, and if it were worse, even killed.

"Grr..." The little wolf approached Cold Autumn Cicada, emitting a whining sound.

At that moment, everyone's gaze was on Cold Autumn Cicada, eager to see how the Yuleng Sect's genius girl would handle this situation. After all, in their eyes, the wolf-shaped beast had clearly intended to attack Luo Tian.

Cold Autumn Cicada's brows furrowed tightly, sensing the little wolf had approached Luo Tian with fondness. Yet it hadn't expected this youth to kick it away.

"Luolei?" Cold Autumn Cicada's brows furrowed, as if pondering how to handle this. A tense atmosphere rose again on the Storm and Thunder Platform.

"Apologize, or die!" Duan Xingchen's voice rang out from behind Cold Autumn Cicada, his face carrying a cold expression. His overwhelming aura swept toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 345: Arrival

Chapter 345: Arrival

"Hmm?" Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly, gazing at Duan Xingchen. He understood the reason from his eyes.

"Beauty's curse!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, feeling unlucky. It seemed every trouble he encountered was tied to a woman's admirer.

"Brother Xingchen, you can't say that! Everyone saw it—this beast wanted to attack my brother. My brother did nothing wrong. If he hadn't reacted quickly, it might have been him who was injured! Let me tell you..." Zheng Xin began patiently explaining to Duan Xingchen.

"Stop!" Cold Autumn Cicada and Duan Xingchen spoke in unison, interrupting Zheng Xin. Cold Autumn Cicada's furrowed brows slightly softened. Though she knew the little wolf had no ill intent, others might see it as an attack. She could sense the youth's power was well-controlled, so she decided not to pursue it.

But before Cold Autumn Cicada could speak, Duan Xingchen's voice rang out again: "Brother Zheng, he must apologize. If it weren't for your favor today, it wouldn't just be an apology—he'd lose a leg!"

Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly. He knew now wasn't the time to clash, but Duan Xingchen's tone irked him. If he weren't wary of the Sky-Sword Sect's strength nearby, he'd have wanted to test this Starry Body's abilities.

"Brother Xingchen, if I say today this friend is under my protection, what will you do?" Zheng Xin's eyes narrowed, no longer appearing indifferent. His gaze was deep and resolute toward Duan Xingchen.

"Ah..." The crowd's eyes showed curiosity, gazing at Luo Tian. They hadn't expected the children of three sects' masters to fight over such a common youth.

"If I must, then I'll have no choice!" Duan Xingchen again drew his Starry Sword, his face showing determination.

"Trying to flatter Autumn Cicada sister by stepping on my head?" Zheng Xin saw Duan Xingchen's intent to fight and smiled coldly, a hammer appearing in his hand.

The hammer in Zheng Xin's grasp radiated a heavy aura.

"That's the Flying Cloud Hammer? I didn't expect Zheng Xin could activate this!" The crowd saw the hammer, their faces showing shock.

"Legend says the Flying Cloud Hammer is a treasure of the Wind-Blade Valley, weighing nine thousand eight hundred catties. This must be an imitation; otherwise, a Bone Transcendence Stage wouldn't be able to control it. Even Brother Zheng's older brothers used imitations, right?"

"But even an imitation is impressive! I heard the Flying Cloud Hammer's imitation weighs two thousand catties!" The crowd murmured, their eyes filled with admiration as they gazed at Zheng Xin.

"Good, Brother Zheng, today I'll test your Flying Cloud Hammer's strength!" Duan Xingchen smiled, his Starry Sword in hand as he stepped toward Zheng Xin.

Cold Autumn Cicada ignored their fight, her eyes fixed on Luo Tian, making him uneasy. But he quickly realized she was testing him.

A cold spiritual sense fell upon Luo Tian's mind: "Speak, what relationship do you have with Luo Tian?"

"Uh..." Luo Tian hadn't expected Cold Autumn Cicada to communicate via spiritual sense. His face momentarily froze.

"Miss, sorry, I don't know this Luo Tian!" Luo Tian dared not reveal himself. He knew some strong cultivators could hear spiritual transmissions, so he hadn't told Cold Autumn Cicada his identity. He knew their friendship meant she wouldn't betray him.

"Ridiculous! The only one who could make the little wolf feel this way is me. There's another person—Luo Tian! The genius of the Northern Lands' Five Elements Sect!" Cold Autumn Cicada's cold voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Sorry, miss, I really don't know this Luo Tian. Maybe it's because I'm too handsome—so handsome that even wolves like me!" Luo Tian, seeing Cold Autumn Cicada wouldn't stop, decided to fabricate nonsense.

"Hmph..." Cold Autumn Cicada let out a cold snort, hearing Luo Tian's words. Her eyes showed slight disdain.

Her gaze fell on Luo Tian adjusting his hair, making her uncertain. After all, in her memory, Luo Tian was sometimes eccentric but had never been so self-absorbed.

"Clash..." The sound of weapons colliding pulled Cold Autumn Cicada back to reality, her gaze turning toward Zheng Xin and Duan Xingchen.

"Stomp... stomp... stomp..." As Luo Tian and Cold Autumn Cicada communicated spiritually, Zheng Xin and Duan Xingchen had already completed their first clash.

A sword against a hammer, they collided fiercely, sending nearby Body Tempering Stage cultivators flying backward.

Their figures also retreated, leaving a trail of footprints beneath them.

"Wonderful!" The crowd marveled at Duan Xingchen and Zheng Xin, their faces filled with admiration.

Though they had only fought once, the power radiated by them made even Bone Transcendence Stage One cultivators tremble. They felt that their ordinary attacks would instantly kill a Bone Transcendence Stage One.

"Again!" Duan Xingchen, seeing he had matched Zheng Xin's strength, showed dissatisfaction. Starlight radiated from his body as he wore a determined expression.

"Brother Xingchen, why fight so violently? There's nothing we can't talk about!" A blue energy ring surrounded the Flying Cloud Hammer, Zheng Xin smiling as he tried to persuade.

"Then have this youth kneel and apologize to Autumn Cicada!" Duan Xingchen looked at Luo Tian with arrogance.

"If you don't kneel and apologize to Autumn Cicada now, this Zheng Xin won't protect you forever!" Duan Xingchen knew today with Zheng Xin's interference, he couldn't harm Luo Tian.

"Whoosh..." Everyone's gazes turned to Luo Tian, eager to see this youth who had just kicked Cold Autumn Cicada's beast face the pressure from the Sky-Sword Sect's Duan Xingchen.

"It's impossible!" Luo Tian's face turned cold; he couldn't do what Duan Xingchen asked.

"Rumors..." The crowd stirred, surprised Luo Tian's Body Tempering Stage Nine strength could still be so defiant.

"Good... you've got guts! You're truly my friend, Brother Luo! Don't worry, as long as I'm here, no one will ride over your head!" Zheng Xin was satisfied with Luo Tian's words, patting his shoulder and laughing loudly.

"Die!" Duan Xingchen coldly snorted, his eyes like a lightning strike in the night. For years, besides Cold Autumn Cicada and Zheng Xin, no one of their age had dared speak to him like this. And this youth was a Body Tempering Stage Nine nobody with no background.

Luo Tian realized today he had to fight, his face showing a fierce expression. This was the first time in years he'd been forced into such a situation.

A long sword appeared in his hand, his eyes cold: "What do you want?"

"Boom..." The crowd was stunned. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to actually draw a weapon against Duan Xingchen.

Chapter 346: The Joint Recruitment Begins

Chapter 346: The Joint Recruitment Begins

"Die!" Duan Xingchen didn't hesitate, a streak of sword energy slicing toward Luo Tian.

"Crack..." Luo Tian raised his sword high, but it was useless; the sword snapped in two, falling to the ground.

"Hmph..." After cutting Luo Tian's sword into two pieces, Duan Xingchen coldly snorted and rushed toward him.

Luo Tian's eyes narrowed, scattering golden and fiery energy around his body as he dodged and charged toward Duan Xingchen.

"Stop!" Zheng Xin's face darkened, surprised Duan Xingchen had actually dared to fight in front of him.

"A dual-attribute body? I didn't expect this youth to be so arrogant!" The crowd marveled, seeing Luo Tian's dual-attribute energy and murmuring.

"What good is a dual-attribute body?" Duan Xingchen's lips curled, his face showing disdain. His body moved like a meteor toward Luo Tian.

In an instant, wind surged; just as their bodies were about to collide, the Storm and Thunder Platform's center suddenly rose a hundred-zhang-high platform.

"Whirr..." Energy fluctuations spread, and just as they were about to collide, dozens of powerful auras descended from the sky. The overwhelming pressure made Luo Tian and Duan Xingchen pause.

"Immortal Soul Stage! All of them are at the Immortal Soul Stage!" Someone shouted, their face filled with shock and excitement as they gazed at the sky.

Luo Tian followed the crowd's gaze upward, his face showing solemnity. He hadn't expected the Eastern Lands to be so strong; while Immortal Soul Stage was common in the Northern Lands, he had seen at most twenty during the campaign against the Corpse-Devouring Sect.

He hadn't expected that even for a joint recruitment, the Eastern Lands had dozens of Immortal Soul Stage masters. These people were clearly leaders from various sects in the Kunlun Mountains. Their strength was far greater than that of the Northern Lands.

Three figures flew ahead, their faces carrying a bold aura, with Immortal Soul Peak energy surrounding them.

Thousands of people on the Storm and Thunder Platform trembled, their bodies shaking under the immense pressure from the sky. Even Luo Tian felt overwhelmed by the terrifying pressure and forced himself to straighten his slightly bent legs.

The dozens of masters showed no emotion, landing on the suddenly raised platform. Their eyes swept over the crowd on the Storm and Thunder Platform.

"Today is our Kunlun Mountains' joint recruitment day. Whether you can soar into the sects depends entirely on your own strength!" A clear voice rang out among the crowd.

"Did you see that? That's my father, how impressive he is! My father was..." Zheng Xin approached Luo Tian, his face filled with pride as he introduced his father Zheng Hongsheng.

"Enough talk. I'll now announce the first round's rules!" Zheng Hongsheng smiled, pointing his hand. The Storm and Thunder Platform changed again, with energy patterns rising beneath it.

"Boom..." A dizzying sensation filled the crowd's minds.

The Storm and Thunder Platform seemed to vanish, transporting them into another space. The dozens of Immortal Soul Stage masters' auras vanished as well, leaving only the dense crowd.

Before them were two wide roads stretching to a hundred-zhang-high platform at the end. The platforms bore the words "Body Tempering" and "Bone Transcendence."

"You've seen those two platforms, right? The first round is standing on one of these platforms. They can only hold a hundred people, no more. Standing on the platform means passing the first round!"

"Of course, whether you become one of those hundred depends entirely on your strength. Body Tempering Stage disciples should compete for the 'Body Tempering' platform, and Bone Transcendence Stage disciples for the 'Bone Transcendence' one. The methods are unrestricted!" Zheng Hongsheng's voice echoed in the vast space.

"By the way, I should explain—when I said methods are unrestricted, it means killing is allowed. Each of you will have a jade tablet on your body. If you want to quit, say 'surrender' into the tablet and you'll be transported out. Of course, that means failure. If you don't reach the platform, but perform well or have more jade tablets, there's still a chance to be selected by the sects. No more talk—let's begin!" Zheng Hongsheng finished speaking and fell silent.

"Wow..." Luo Tian inhaled sharply, stunned by Zheng Hongsheng's words. There were thousands of people here; to eliminate so many in the first round was brutal, more bloody than the Five Elements Sect's recruitment.

The Storm and Thunder Platform briefly fell silent before erupting into murmurs.

"Brother, I'm going to the Bone Transcendence platform. We'll have to part for a while. After it's over, we can chat for three days and nights! Remember to stay safe—even if you fail, I'll ask my father to let you enter the Wind-Blade Valley!" Zheng Xin patted Luo Tian's shoulder.

Luo Tian felt warmth in his heart, replying: "Don't worry, I'm fine!"

After a brief commotion, the crowd scattered. People rushed toward the two platforms like madmen.

Luo Tian estimated that there were about four thousand Body Tempering Stage disciples and two thousand Bone Transcendence Stage ones.

"The Wind-Blade Valley is a good choice, but my goal is the Yuleng Sect, which specializes in seal arts!" Luo Tian smiled, clearly confident he was invincible at the Body Tempering Stage. This first round would be easy!

Luo Tian strode toward the Body Tempering platform, but after taking a few steps, he suddenly turned back. His golden light flashed beneath his feet as he returned to the starting point.

"The Yuleng Sect is clearly a major sect in Kunlun Mountains. Even if I have no opponents at the Body Tempering Stage, there's a chance I might not be selected. It's better to take a risk!" Luo Tian's face showed determination, his gaze turning toward the Bone Transcendence platform.

"Invisible under these conditions, I can't use much of my power. But now my physical state has reached the mid-stage Bone Transcendence, and even though my energy is sealed, it's enough to match the early stage of Bone Transcendence! I still have a chance!" Luo Tian muttered, his eyes flashing with determination as he stepped onto the Bone Transcendence road.

Chapter 347: The Killing Begins

Chapter 347: The Killing Begins

Kunlun Mountains, Storm and Thunder Platform.

Outside, not only had dozens of Immortal Soul Stage masters arrived, but also some onlookers and disciples from other sects had quietly come.

Outside, a vast water curtain formed, clearly reflecting the scene within their spatial realm. Dozens of Immortal Soul Stage masters wore interested expressions, watching the images.

"Ah... a Body Tempering Stage youth dares to enter the Bone Transcendence road—this is interesting!" The Yuleng Sect's master, Ling Hongcai, smiled as he watched Luo Tian's figure.

"Indeed, this youth has guts!" The Sky-Sword Sect's master, Duan Chenfeng, also blinked slightly, following Ling Hongcai's gaze.

"This youth is either seeking death or trying to draw our attention. This action is like a sheep falling into a tiger's den!" Other Immortal Soul Stage masters murmured.

"Let's see what happens!" Zheng Hongsheng, Ling Hongcai, and Duan Chenfeng all wore smiles.

Luo Tian didn't know his actions had already caught the attention of dozens of Immortal Soul Stage masters outside. Now he walked along the road, surprised no one had targeted him yet.

"Ha ha... How's that? I beat you in speed!" Zheng Xin smiled proudly, instantly standing on the platform. His eyes gleamed as he watched people rushing toward it.

"Damn!" Zheng Xin's gaze fell on Luo Tian walking slowly at the back of the crowd. His mouth gaped open, his face filled with disbelief.

Zheng Xin instinctively rubbed his eyes, confirming it was indeed Luo Tian. His confusion stemmed from not knowing why Luo Tian had chosen to enter the Bone Transcendence battlefield.

Zheng Xin knew Luo Tian was extremely strong—just by withstanding Duan Xingchen's sword energy at Body Tempering Stage Nine, he could see it. Plus, his dual-attribute body made him a top contender in the Body Tempering Stage. Zheng Xin couldn't fathom why Luo Tian had chosen this self-destructive path.

Meanwhile, people were gradually standing on the Bone Transcendence platform. They eyed it cautiously, knowing they could only stay there by virtue of their speed. To remain on the platform required sufficient strength.

Cold Autumn Cicada moved, accompanied by her little wolf, standing on the platform. Her eyes glanced downward, and when she saw Luo Tian in the crowd, her brows furrowed slightly.

"Dead man walking—this fool is doomed. No one's attacking him now, but when the killing begins, he'll definitely be dead!" Duan Xingchen's face showed cold mockery as he stood before Cold Autumn Cicada, laughing.

Huo Zhiyong, Ding Xiaoyan, and Su Yewu were also in the crowd. Though they came from the secular world, they were geniuses who had become part of the group standing on the platform.

Luo Tian walked at the edge of the crowd, feeling relaxed. He knew no one was attacking him now because everyone wanted to seize the platform's qualification.

When no one dared to attack the platform, to draw the attention of major sects, those below would instantly fight over others' jade tablets. At that time, he would inevitably become a target of everyone's desire.
