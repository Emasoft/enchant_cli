Luo Tian was expelled from the Sealing Soul Cauldron at that very moment. He immediately clamped his mouth shut, not because he lacked the desire to curse, but due to his body's abysmal condition. He could feel his physical functions had deteriorated far beyond their state from a day prior. Even a Bone-Subjugation Stage cultivator would be impossible for him to escape from alive.

The reason Luo Tian fell silent was not his own strength, but the surrounding environment. At that moment, he sensed a series of cracks forming around him, with gusts of wind howling from the fissures, sweeping across his body.

Though the winds were not fierce, Luo Tian could feel the terrifying pressure emanating from within the cracks. If he touched them, he would certainly perish without a chance of survival.

Where was this place? A deep confusion arose within Luo Tian, preventing him from acting recklessly. He even dared not retrieve the Sealing Soul Cauldron, fearing some unexpected occurrence.

However, after extending his spiritual awareness, Luo Tian's face lit up with joy. Having previously consumed the Explosive Spirit Pill, his spiritual awareness had temporarily risen to the Mid-Refining Void Stage.

After using his spiritual awareness, he discovered that it had not reverted to the Early-Refining Void Stage as expected. Instead, it remained stabilized at the Mid-Refining Void Stage.

Luo Tian's gaze flickered with surprise as he glanced at the Sealing Soul Cauldron before him, his face contorted with anger. "You say no fate, but I have a great deal of connection with you! A mere regional-grade treasure—how dare you think I cannot subdue it!"

His eyes gleamed with determination. He gritted his teeth, staring at the Sealing Soul Cauldron before slamming his palm onto its surface. A deep resonance echoed, shaking Luo Tian's hand numbly.

"First priority: I must heal my wounds. Also, the three hundred years of vitality—this is a problem. If Jiang Nanxuan were here, it would be ideal!" Luo Tian sighed internally, clearly admiring Jiang Nanxuan's miraculous method of replenishing vitality.

After musing, Luo Tian took out a pill and placed it in his hand. His vitality had been severely depleted, and his injuries were grave—though he hadn't had time to focus on them before.

With vitality lost and unable to replenish it in the short term, he could only focus on healing his wounds.

Luo Tian dared not venture far; the spatial fissures filled him with fear. He sat cross-legged beneath the Sealing Soul Cauldron, beginning his healing process.

Meanwhile, three thousand zhang away, a young man sat with a solemn expression on the ground. His face was equally pale, covered in wounds of varying sizes. An ordinary person would have been writhing in pain, but the black-cloaked man seemed unaffected. His body was shrouded in dark qi, his face etched with concentration. Two black swords were planted beside him, radiating a dark glow that formed a barrier before him. This young man was the one who had previously attempted to assassinate Luo Tian.

"Ah, these two are quite formidable... both possess strong physical bodies. Which one should I choose?" A deep, aged voice echoed from an unassuming spatial fissure. Two cold eyes seemed to scan over their prey, lingering on Luo Tian and the assassin.

At that moment, both Luo Tian and the assassin opened their eyes simultaneously, gazing toward the distant fissure. Yet to them, everything appeared normal, with no discernible difference.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly; he felt as though he were being watched, seated under another's gaze.

This place was too strange. Luo Tian murmured softly before closing his eyes again, commencing the refinement of the healing pill with his spiritual energy.

"Excellent... truly excellent. It's difficult to choose between them. I must decide who to possess, and then escape this cursed place!"

Time passed. Luo Tian's wounds gradually healed under the nourishment of the pill, yet his vitality remained unchanged.

"Boom... boom..." A series of thunderous sounds startled Luo Tian awake.

"Someone?" Luo Tian's mind puzzled, his spiritual awareness instantly expanding outward.

Since he could hear the sound, his spiritual awareness only reached several thousand zhang before discovering the source.

Within his spiritual perception, several young men were chasing a robust youth, their martial techniques raining down upon him like rain.

Though the robust youth was at the Late-Bone-Subjugation Stage, those pursuing him were clearly no ordinary foes. His escape was fraught with difficulty, as he dodged spatial fissures while evading their attacks.

"Haha! Zheng Boxue, you never imagined that one day you'd be chased like a stray dog!" The pursuer laughed loudly.

"Hmph, if you think I'll let you kill me, you're mistaken! Remember, this is the Wind-Blade Valley!" Zheng Boxue sneered, spitting out blood as he retorted.

"Last gasp!" The pursuers' faces bore mockery, yet their eyes held deep apprehension. Had they not feared Zheng Boxue's final retaliation, they would have already struck him down.

Moreover, Zheng Boxue's identity was uniquely significant; they had employed numerous strategies to lure him into the Wind-Blade Valley, giving them this opportunity for an ambush. Otherwise, their strength would have been no match for Zheng Boxue at his peak.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly, unsure why the name Zheng Boxue felt familiar. Yet he could not recall having met such a person before.

"Never mind, with my current state, even if I wished to help, I would not be a match for these Bone-Subjugation Mid-stage cultivators," Luo Tian sighed, resuming his healing.

Yet as he closed his eyes again, his brows furrowed slightly. Within his spiritual awareness, the robust youth moved like lightning toward his direction. If not for avoiding spatial fissures, he would have reached Luo Tian within a moment.

"Troublesome," Luo Tian muttered, rising to retrieve the Sealing Soul Cauldron. After all, with his current condition, exposing it would leave him vulnerable.

"Half my injuries have healed, but I've lost three hundred years of vitality. I should escape," Luo Tian sighed, taking a step forward.

Yet as he lifted his foot, Zheng Boxue's figure suddenly surged forth, appearing before Luo Tian in mere breaths.

Chapter 407: Zheng Boxue

Zheng Boxue's face was pale as he materialized before Luo Tian. He had never imagined that the depths of the Wind-Blade Valley would hold another person's presence.

Upon seeing Luo Tian, Zheng Boxue's eyes flickered with surprise before settling into a bitter expression. His pale face bore a trace of guilt as he spoke softly, "Brother, you should flee. I've dragged you into this!"

Luo Tian was speechless, cursing his misfortune while placing a pill in Zheng Boxue's mouth.

"Kid, you dare to save him?" A mocking voice echoed from behind Luo Tian at that moment.

A series of whooshing sounds followed, and five young men appeared behind him.

Luo Tian's brows furrowed tightly without a word, pushing Zheng Boxue aside. He had intended to give him a pill and leave him to his fate, not wishing to involve himself further.

In the cultivation world, such scenarios were common; every day saw countless assassinations. Giving him a pill was already commendable.

Yet Luo Tian hadn't anticipated such an overreaction from them merely for giving a pill.

"Brother, you should run!" Zheng Boxue spoke weakly.

Zheng Boxue knew these people would not let Luo Tian leave alive. His identity was too significant; they would never allow him to escape.

Indeed, as Zheng Boxue had predicted, the five young men slowly surrounded Luo Tian and Zheng Boxue, their faces carrying a faint mockery.

"Are you trying to kill me?" Luo Tian's expression turned solemn, his aura abruptly shifting. His eyes gleamed with sharpness as he gazed at the five young men.

The five, upon seeing his gaze, trembled slightly. Such an expression had only ever been felt from one type of person—those who viewed them as mere insects. Only someone at the Nascent Soul Stage or higher could regard them so contemptuously.

"Boom..." As if confirming their thoughts, Luo Tian's aura shifted again, his eyes taking on a touch of沧桑 (wornness).

"This..." The five men's eyes widened in shock, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Late-Bone-Subjugation... Early-Nascent Soul... Mid-Nascent Soul... Late-Nascent Soul..."

"Late-Nascent Soul..." Under the five's hesitant gazes, Luo Tian's aura solidified at the Late-Nascent Soul Stage.

"Ah... returning to the Late-Nascent Soul stage, it's not bad," his gaze swept over them, the overwhelming aura causing their legs to tremble slightly. His eyes carried a touch of沧桑.

This gaze shook them profoundly, their faces etched with fear. Such an aura was only possessed by ancient monsters who had lived for centuries. Coupled with Luo Tian's words and his terrifying Late-Nascent Soul aura, they suspected a possibility.

Some elder cultivators preferred to appear as commoners or low-level cultivators, wandering the world. The five young men's eyes clearly saw Luo Tian as such. Otherwise, no one would dare enter the depths of the Wind-Blade Valley alone at the Bone-Subjugation Stage.

"O... elder..." The leader of the group stammered, his face filled with fear as he gazed at Luo Tian's youthful appearance.

"Want to kill me?" Luo Tian's voice remained the same, yet his eyes carried more沧桑. His aura exuded an ancient presence.

"N... no..." The youth's face was drenched in cold sweat, his mind sighing inwardly. He hadn't expected to encounter such a monster here.

"Then why do you still want to kill him?" Luo Tian pointed at Zheng Boxue, a cruel smile revealing his white teeth.

"This..." The youth hesitated, his face displaying embarrassment.

If Zheng Boxue survived, they would not live long either. Yet their current actions had clearly angered this elder.

As the five hesitated, Luo Tian extended his hand, pointing at the leader. A surge of grey spiritual energy instantly enveloped him.

"Go..." After his command, Luo Tian's voice echoed like a frigid wind from the abyss, slicing through their hearts.

The leader initially felt fear, dreading this powerful elder would kill him instantly. But as his finger touched the youth, he felt no pain. The youth's face relaxed slightly, confusion flickering across his expression.

Unfortunately, as Luo Tian uttered the word "go," the youth's face turned pale like a sheet of paper, his eyes filled with reverence. He bowed deeply.

"Thank you, elder. I shall take my leave!" The youth stammered, his face filled with respect as he took a step back.

"Go, and remember not to bother me again. Though my temper has improved over the years, I am not averse to crushing a few pests!" Luo Tian's eyes carried more沧桑 as he waved his hand.

"Respectfully, elder, I shall remember!" The youth nodded to the others before dashing away.

Watching them vanish, Luo Tian did not immediately return to his original state. He waited until they disappeared from his spiritual awareness, then took a deep breath, sweat trickling down his forehead.

"Damn it, I'm lucky I used to act arrogant; otherwise, those bastards would have caught on!" Luo Tian sighed softly.

Zheng Boxue, too, was stunned. He hadn't expected to encounter a cultivator at least at the Soul-Formation Stage. For a moment, he dared not speak. Yet when he heard Luo Tian's words and saw his aura drop, his lips twitched.

"Big brother, are we really leaving like this? What will the leader say if we let Zheng Boxue go?"

"Yes, Big Brother, is this elder truly a master? I don't think he's as strong as he claims!" The other youths murmured.

"Smack..." The leader, called Big Brother, slapped the one who doubted Luo Tian's strength.

He glanced警惕 (cautiously) around, ensuring the elder hadn't appeared before speaking gravely: "You know nothing. Do you realize what I lost when he pointed at me?" His face bore fear, his eyes lingering on Luo Tian's direction.

"What?" The other youths looked puzzled, awaiting his answer.

"Vitality—forty years of it!" His eyes were filled with fear. That single finger had taken forty years of vitality from him. He couldn't fathom what would happen if Luo Tian used his full strength. Would he die instantly?

Chapter 408: Second Son of the Wind-Blade Valley

Hearing this, the others inhaled sharply, their gazes filled with reverence toward Luo Tian's direction. They had now fully confirmed that Luo Tian was definitely someone they could not provoke.

"Big Brother, what should we do? If Zheng Boxue escapes, our fate will be grim!" One youth looked at Zheng Boxue and spoke softly.

Hearing this, the others' faces darkened, their gazes turning to the leader.

The leader, called Big Brother, frowned deeply, his brows knitting as he pondered for a moment before speaking solemnly: "Wait. I'll wait at the exit. I don't believe Zheng Boxue will not come out!"

"Zheng Boxue has been poisoned with the Ten-Day Spirit-Subjugation Toxin. He cannot escape; within ten days, his spiritual energy will wither. Plus, he's injured. Not only can he not escape the spatial fissures, but even the Wind-Blade Valley's winds could blow him away. He must come out!" Big Brother's face bore a sinister expression as he spoke.

"Yes, we'll wait ten days!" The other four youths echoed in agreement.

Big Brother's face broke into a smile, but his mind was reluctant. He knew the elder's temperament was capricious; he couldn't be certain if Luo Tian would interfere. If so, they'd have no hope at all.

Yet he soon relented; this was their only option. After a short journey, the five sat on the ground. This path led to the Wind-Blade Valley's entrance and was the only route back to their sect.

...

Luo Tian took a breath, watching Zheng Boxue's wide-eyed gaze at him. He sighed, "Alright, go. Stop staring at me; I still need to heal."

"Ah, thank you, Brother. If it's not a bother, please share your name so I may repay this kindness in the future!" Zheng Boxue's face bore gratitude.

Luo Tian nodded slightly, recognizing Zheng Boxue's spiritual energy gradually fading. Despite this, he still wished to repay the favor. This gesture significantly improved Luo Tian's opinion of him.

"Luolei!" Luo Tian hesitated before revealing the name he had used previously.

Zheng Boxue's face flickered with suspicion, as if he'd heard this name before. Yet after a moment of thought, he couldn't recall where.

"Luolei Brother, take this jade token. When you find me in the Wind-Blade Valley, if I'm not there or have died, someone will surely repay this favor!" Zheng Boxue retrieved a jade token from his storage pouch, smiling as he handed it to Luo Tian.

"Wind-Blade Valley... Zheng?" Luo Tian mused internally, wondering if this man had any connection to Zheng Xin. If so, he'd truly saved the right person today.

"May I ask, Brother, do you know Zheng Xin of the Wind-Blade Valley?" Luo Tian asked without hesitation.

Hearing Zheng Xin's name, Zheng Boxue's face lit up with excitement, though it faded quickly. He scrutinized Luo Tian carefully; if he were Zheng Xin's enemy, that would be problematic.

"Know him? Naturally! I ask, Luolei Brother, what's your relationship with Zheng Xin?" Zheng Boxue spoke softly, his voice restrained as he asked.

Though Zheng Boxue masked it well, Luo Tian's sharp eyes saw through his thoughts. Having endured years of trials, his mind was no less cunning than ancient monsters. He immediately discerned Zheng Boxue's thoughts.

"We are sworn brothers!" Luo Tian's face bore sincerity, recalling Zheng Xin's talkative nature.

"Sworn brothers?" Zheng Boxue's face bore disbelief, his gaze scrutinizing Luo Tian again.

"Truthfully, our relationship is very close. Yet I've never met any of Zheng Xin's friends!" Zheng Boxue spoke, knowing his brother well. With Zheng Xin's mouth, he had few friends.

"Haha! If I'm not mistaken, you must be Zheng Xin's elder brother!" Luo Tian suddenly realized, recalling how Zheng Xin had once mentioned his eldest brother, Zheng Tianxiao, and second brother, Zheng Boxue. Though time had passed, and Zheng Xin's chatter was endless, he'd largely ignored it.

Through his conversation with Zheng Boxue, Luo Tian suddenly recalled—this man was likely Zheng Xin's second brother, Zheng Boxue.

"You are?" Hearing Luo Tian's words, Zheng Boxue was stunned, his confusion deepening.

"Big Brother Zheng, sorry for my deception earlier. I am Luo Tian, who met Zheng Xin during the joint recruitment. You may not know me!" Luo Tian smiled softly, speaking gently.

"Zhang Bing?" Hearing Luo Tian's name, Zheng Boxue was stunned, his eyes filled with shock.

Luo Tian's name had spread across the Eastern Region recently. His spectacular performance during joint recruitment, his role in eliminating the Tianshi Sect, and especially his recent act of killing two Nascent Soul Stage elders from the Yuling Sect had made him a household name.

Yet Zheng Boxue could not have imagined this pale-faced youth was the renowned Luo Tian.

"Without a doubt!" Luo Tian sighed helplessly, explaining.

Hearing Luo Tian confirm again, Zheng Boxue's face lit up with joy. He had long heard his father mention that Zheng Xin and Luo Tian were close friends. Now, encountering Luo Tian here was a blessing. With Luo Tian's help, he could escape and solve all problems, including the poison in his body.

However, upon seeing Luo Tian's pale face, no better than his own, Zheng Boxue felt disappointment.

"Luo Tian Brother, how did you enter the Wind-Blade Valley? This place isn't exactly the deepest part of the Wind-Blade Valley, but to enter here, you should have passed our sect's checks. Also, I noticed your injuries are severe." Zheng Boxue asked.

Hearing this, Luo Tian smiled bitterly, recounting how he had separated from Zheng Xin and been carried here by a storm.

Hearing Luo Tian's survival in the storm, Zheng Boxue was impressed: "Luo Tian Brother truly possesses formidable strength. Even Nascent Soul Stage elders would perish in such a storm. With your Late-Bone-Subjugation Stage cultivation, you've survived unscathed—truly admirable!"

Chapter 409: Purple-Crested Wind-Thunder Branch

Within the Wind-Blade Valley, spatial fissures drifted like black feathers across the sky. Though they resembled feathers, all knew their terrifying tearing power beneath their ordinary appearance.

At that moment, both Luo Tian and Zheng Boxue had pale faces, carefully dodging the feather-like spatial fissures as they struggled toward the valley's depths.

After Luo Tian recounted how he had entered the Wind-Blade Valley, Zheng Boxue briefly explained why he had come here and been ambushed.

It turned out Zheng Boxue had entered the Wind-Blade Valley for a rare treasure—the Purple-Crested Wind-Thunder Tree. Some people had informed him of this, giving Zheng Boxue an ancient map.

The three sons of Zheng Hongsheng all possessed exceptional wind-elemental constitutions. The Purple-Crested Wind-Thunder Tree's branches and leaves were of immense benefit to wind-elemental cultivators. Its leaves could be used in medicine or help wind-elemental cultivators grasp the essence of wind, enabling them to advance to the Nascent Soul Stage.

Upon hearing this, Zheng Boxue had been eager and rushed in without even greeting his father, taking the people who gave him the map into the Wind-Blade Valley to find the Purple-Crested Wind-Thunder Tree and collect some leaves for his brothers to study.

Zheng Boxue hadn't anticipated this was a trap—a plot to eliminate him. Just one day after entering the Wind-Blade Valley, they had poisoned him with Ten-Day Spirit-Subjugation Toxin and ambushed him. The rest was what Luo Tian had witnessed.

However, after Zheng Boxue and Luo Tian carefully examined the map given to Zheng Boxue by the others, they discovered it was genuine. The ancient aura alone could not be faked.

At this point, both men's situations were suicidal if they tried to escape. Moreover, the Wind-Blade Valley had an unknown reason—identity tokens' transmission failed within it. This was known to all Wind-Blade Valley disciples, which was one of the reasons they had lured Zheng Boxue here.

"Ahem..." Zheng Boxue coughed lightly. They had been walking through the Wind-Blade Valley for two days now, and Zheng Boxue's condition had deteriorated. His spiritual energy was dwindling, his body growing weaker.

In contrast, Luo Tian had improved significantly compared to Zheng Boxue. Though his face was pale, his injuries were completely healed, and his spiritual energy had largely recovered—only lacking three hundred years of vitality.

"Brother Luo Tian, perhaps we should give up? According to the map's location, it'll take at least four or five days with our speed. Plus, the deeper we go, the denser the spatial fissures become—harder to avoid! You should escape on your own. I'm sure you can break through those people's blockade!" Zheng Boxue spoke with a bitter smile.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly. He could sense Zheng Boxue's condition worsening. If he left him here, not only would it be hard to explain to Zheng Xin, but his conscience would also feel guilty.

The reason they hadn't gone out was because they had calculated these people would never let Zheng Boxue go. Thus, they decided to take a risk and seek the Purple-Crested Wind-Thunder Tree. Luo Tian knew this tree's leaves had a special function—hiding one's spiritual energy. This was why they sought the tree: to escape the group's encirclement and leave the Wind-Blade Valley. Once out, they'd have a chance to recover. Then who would be the one being hunted?

"Big Brother Zheng, I have a plan—though it may inconvenience you slightly," Luo Tian said, his gaze questioning.

"Brother Luo Tian, what are you saying? A man of valor must be flexible! In this situation, we can't afford to care about such things. Speak up; I'll fully cooperate!" Zheng Boxue's face bore a bitter smile.

"Then it's only委屈 (discomfort) for Big Brother Zheng. You'll have to stay inside the Soul-Containment Bag for a while. I'll release you once I find the location," Luo Tian said, somewhat embarrassed. After all, the Soul-Containment Bag was a tool used by Yuling Sect to imprison beasts.

Hearing this, Zheng Boxue's face changed. He had certainly heard of the Yuling Sect's Soul-Containment Bags, even possessing one himself but never using it. Now hearing Luo Tian wanted him to enter the bag, he felt some resistance. Yet after a moment, he relented: "Alright, there's no other choice now!"

Hearing Zheng Boxue agree, Luo Tian didn't hesitate. Time was critical. He took out the Soul-Containment Bag and, with a thought, sealed Zheng Boxue inside.

After sealing Zheng Boxue, Luo Tian stretched his limbs slightly, forcing his weakened body to dodge and vanish from the spot.

"Purple-Crested Wind-Thunder Tree? Excellent, it suits me well. Once I find it, I'll deal with you too!" A weak voice echoed after Luo Tian disappeared. A ghostly figure followed him, drifting like a feather.

"Five-Element Body—there he is! But this isn't the best timing. When these two are weakened, I'll possess them and fully revive! Ha!" An aged voice echoed from a fissure.

Neither Luo Tian nor the assassin noticed an unassuming spatial fissure drifting behind them like a feather.

Meanwhile, Zheng Xin, Long Baobao, and Leng Qiuchan had also stabilized. Upon returning to Yuling Sect, they heard a storm had flown in from afar without warning, causing significant damage. It was only after the Patriarch of the Soul-Formation Stage intervened that the storm had been redirected to the Wind-Blade Valley.

After hearing this, Leng Qiuchan immediately decided to enter the Wind-Blade Valley to find Luo Tian. After all, when Luo Tian had exited the Sealing Soul Cauldron, Long Baobao could sense his aura again—this time in the Wind-Blade Valley's direction.

On another front, a white-cloaked woman appeared on the North Sea connecting the Eastern and Northern Regions. Her face bore a smile; she could now sense Luo Tian's aura, which delighted her immensely.

At昆仑 Mountain (Kunlun Mountain), Yuling Sect had received several special guests that day.

Zhang Ziping, the Pill Hall Master of the Northern Region's Five-Element Sect, and two tall men with dark skin arrived at Yuling Sect. They sat on the back mountain of Yuling Sect, their faces grim.

Three Soul-Formation Stage elders accompanied them, their expressions also solemn.

Chapter 410: Perilous Situation

"Unclear, what business do you have with my Yuling Sect?" A Soul-Formation Stage elder spoke softly, his gaze wary as he looked at the two men. Zhang Ziping was completely ignored.

Though Zhang Ziping had reached the Nascent Soul Stage and was young, in the eyes of these Soul-Formation Stage elders, he was still insignificant. Though it was said that Nascent Soul Stage cultivators were stronger than those below, in the eyes of Soul-Formation Stage elders, they were merely stronger insects.

"We're here to find a boy named Luo Tian and bring him back!" The man transformed into a black tiger spoke loudly, his aura exuding imperial authority.

"Indeed, hurry up! We're in a rush!" The man transformed into a black bear added, his voice deep and gruff.

Zhang Ziping remained silent, seated there. This was not the time for him to speak; he had no desire to.

"Luo Tian isn't at Yuling Sect—he's gone to the Wind-Blade Valley!" The Yuling Sect's Soul-Formation Stage Patriarch spoke.

"Not at Yuling Sect? Then how did he die? You're still playing dumb with us. Do you think we don't know Luo Tian is dead?"

"Produce his corpse! Don’t say you didn’t even leave a body. If that's the case, don't blame us for tearing down your Wind-Blade Valley!" The black bear growled, his face showing impatience. His aura surged violently.

"Old Black, calm down!" The black tiger smacked the black bear's head.

"Smack..." After the black tiger's slap, the black bear's aura faltered slightly. His face bore a pained expression.

The three Yuling Sect Soul-Formation Stage elders and Leng Hongcai were stunned by the two men's words. They couldn't fathom Luo Tian had died. Previously, Luo Tian had arrived at Yuling Sect in a rush without leaving a soul inscription, and was caught up with various matters. Thus, they had thought he had safely reached the Wind-Blade Valley.

"Hmph! We said he's not at Yuling Sect, and he isn't. If you don’t believe it, go search with your spiritual awareness. Want to tear down our Wind-Blade Valley? See if you have the ability! Two Soul-Formation Stage beasts, dare to run wild in our Wind-Blade Valley? That's a joke!" One of the elders with a short temper glared, shouting.

Hearing this elder's rebuke, the black tiger and bear both bore anger. Their powerful, defiant auras surged forth, pressing against the three Soul-Formation Stage elders.

The three elders were undeterred; their auras rose sharply, clashing against the two men's fierce energy.

"Boom..." The sound of collision echoed as invisible waves formed between the five, pushing Zhang Ziping and Leng Hongcai—both Nascent Soul Stage elders— far away. The entire room shattered under this power, leaving a deep crack from the middle to halfway down the back mountain.

"Though our Great An Forest is far away from your Eastern Region, I can only say that Luo Tian has done us a favor. If he suffers any misfortune, you'll prepare to bear the wrath of our Great An Leader!" The black tiger and bear stepped back slightly.

After all, the Yuling Sect's three elders were of equal strength to them; they had a slight disadvantage.

Hearing the black tiger's words, the three Yuling Sect elders' faces shifted slightly. Though they weren't afraid of the Five-Element Sect, they had heard of Great An Forest's reputation. Moreover, they had previously interacted with the dragon sword from Great An Forest; after all, Yuling Sect's sect had close ties to beasts.

"We said he went to the Wind-Blade Valley, and that's where he is. If you don’t believe it, go ask the Wind-Blade Valley yourself. If you still don't believe us, we can’t help it. Yuling Sect isn’t a soft target; if both sides fight to the end, you can try!" The three elders spoke solemnly. Though they feared Great An Forest, they couldn’t lose Yuling Sect’s dignity.

"Master Black Tiger, let's go to the Wind-Blade Valley first. The priority is finding Luo Tian—whether it’s a corpse or not, he must return to his roots!" Zhang Ziping's face bore sorrow as he spoke to the black tiger and bear.

Zhang Ziping had originally come alone to Yuling Sect, but on the way through the teleportation array, he met the black tiger and bear. He had previously sent Luo Tian to Great An Forest, so he recognized them. Thus, they traveled together to Yuling Sect.

Hearing Zhang Ziping's words, the black tiger and bear thought for a moment. Though they were high-level cultivators, they had been out of the world for too long and were beasts. They knew Zhang Ziping was more thorough in his thinking, so they followed his arrangements throughout the journey.

However, upon arriving at Yuling Sect, they were Soul-Formation Stage elders, and the ones they spoke to were also Soul-Formation Stage. If Zhang Ziping had spoken, it would have been disrespectful.

Hearing Zhang Ziping's words, the two men thought for a moment before nodding and sneering at the three Yuling Sect Soul-Formation elders: "Hmph, we'll go to the Wind-Blade Valley and check. If there's no one, then you’ll wait!"

"I'll go with you. If he’s alive, you must apologize to us three!" The elder who had once picked up even a single spiritual stone spoke, his two eyebrows raised as he was clearly angered by the two men.

"Hmph..." The black tiger and bear sneered, stepping out of the hall.

Zhang Ziping sighed, bowing to Leng Hongcai before following them out.

"I'll be back soon. Luo Tian is our sect's young master; this matter needs to be clarified!" The elder spoke, his body flickering as he followed Zhang Ziping and the others.

...

At that moment, Luo Tian was unaware that several Soul-Formation Stage elders had nearly fought over him and were now heading toward the Wind-Blade Valley.

Luo Tian's body was now covered in wounds, his steps slow and labored. After three days of travel, he fully understood the Wind-Blade Valley's terror. The deeper he went, the more frightened he became; his pace slowed further.

The wind grew stronger as he ventured deeper, even challenging Luo Tian's endurance. The powerful winds made him feel like every step was a struggle.
