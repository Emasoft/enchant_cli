“Though an Epoch Initial, this great formation relies not on individual strength but on overall coordination. With a single thought, it is as if commanding one’s own body. However, Mengchen is a newcomer who has never mastered it before; achieving this level is already quite remarkable!” Fu Xingyue spoke softly, gazing at the Star Moon Guards who fell from the formation.

Chapter 1307: I Am Here, So It Is Not a Defeat

Thunderous roars that reach the heavens echoed through the Star Moon Divine Realm, as three colossal entities clashed repeatedly, radiating terrifying waves that instilled fear in all who witnessed them. The entire Star Moon Divine Realm watched as the three armies collided, their forces plummeting from the battlefield.

“One hundred… two hundred…” The giants forged by the Star Moon Guards were gradually devoured by the opposing armies, their limbs vanishing from sight until the entire figure became translucent.

“Hah! Mengchen, even if you’ve ascended to the Epoch Initial, against our two armies of two thousand elite warriors, you still must fall!” Fu Xingchen’s face bore a triumphant smirk as he stood at the heart of his forces, addressing Luotian.

Kou Tiande’s gaze remained solemn as he stood within the wolfhead formation, continuously striking at the giants formed by the Star Moon Guards.

“We should have coordinated earlier. Even with both armies united, we would not have been their match!” The Star Moon Guards who had been expelled from the battlefield spoke with pale faces, watching their comrades still fighting against the two armies. Their voices carried a tone of frustration.

Numerous figures fell from the battlefield with each strike, though both Star Yang Army and Celestial Army also suffered losses. Yet their injuries were far less severe than those of the Star Moon Guards.

“Eldest brother, even if you are an Epoch Initial commander, winning this battle seems difficult,” Fu Xingyang said softly, his eyes fixed on Luotian’s position at the heart of the giant.

“Not yet decided! It is too early to be triumphant!” Fu Xingyue smiled, gazing at Luotian. She knew that as long as Luotian remained, the Star Moon Guards would not be defeated.

“Hah! Let us wait and see,” Fu Xingyang smiled as well. Though Luotian was an Epoch Initial, both the formations led by Fu Xingchen and Fu Xingyang were comparable to an Epoch Initial, even surpassing the average in strength.

The thunderous clashes continued until the Star Moon Guards dwindled to fewer than two hundred, their formation collapsing with a resounding crash. Luotian and the remaining Star Moon Guards scattered into view.

“Fu Mengchen, you have lost!” Kou Tiande smiled as he stood within the wolfhead formation, addressing Luotian.

Compared to the Star Moon Guards, the Celestial and Star Yang Guards fared much better. Though their strength had diminished slightly, they still maintained the formation’s state.

“Commander!” One thousand Star Moon Guards bore expressions of sorrow, some even weeping.

For years, the myth of the undefeated Star Moon Guards had been shattered by their hands, filling them with guilt.

“Why cry? I am still here!” Luotian gazed at the Star Moon Guards who looked like wilted cabbages, a faint smile on his face.

“Rest assured; I will not let us lose!” Luotian slowly stepped beside the blood wolf, his figure small yet radiating an overwhelming battle spirit.

“Though I do not wish to draw too much attention, I must act now,” Luotian mused internally, contemplating how to face the current situation. It was not fear that held him back but a careful consideration of what could and could not be used.

“Must I still hide? How annoying!” Luotian chuckled internally, standing before the two battle formations.

“Yes! We still have our commander. He is an Epoch Initial, and there is still a chance!” The Star Moon Guards, seeing Luotian’s battle spirit, gradually regained their glimmer of hope.

“Come then!” Luotian addressed Kou Tiande and Fu Xingchen, his voice carrying a hint of nonchalance.

“You seek death!” Fu Xingchen’s eyes flashed with murderous intent as he saw Luotian’s indifferent gaze, commanding the blue stars to crush Luotian.

“Then I shall not be courteous. Though I owe you a favor, I must still claim victory in this contest,” Kou Tiande sighed softly, commanding the blood wolf to howl at Luotian.

“Such a conceited youth!” Onlookers scoffed, watching Luotian singlehandedly face two formations. As the direct lineage of the Star Moon Divine Clan, they knew the strength of the two armies’ battle formations. Though slightly weakened from prior battles, their power remained formidable.

“I shall test it!” Luotian’s figure soared into the sky, transforming into a golden streak. Free from the formation’s constraints, his speed surged dramatically, instantly reaching Fu Xingchen’s blue stars. Two Reincarnation Immortal Bodies unleashed a furious Epoch power, instantly channeled into Luotian’s fists.

“You seek death. Let me crush you!” Fu Xingchen’s eyes gleamed with cruelty as he saw Luotian charging toward them, commanding the blue stars to crush him.

“Crack…!” A thunderous sound echoed like a lightning strike, invisible waves instantly spreading outward, forming a terrifying storm that expanded around the battlefield.

“Blocked!” After the storm passed,一道道 blue lights appeared in people’s sight, like meteors scattering outward.

“One hundred… two hundred… three hundred…” The Star Moon Guards gazed in awe at the blue lights. These were no meteors but Star Soldiers.

“Boom… boom…” Figures fell to the ground, kicking up clouds of dust. Each Star Soldier spat blood, some even fainting.

“Cough… cough…” The blue stars still stood, but Fu Xingchen and nearly four hundred Star Soldiers within the formation bore pale faces, their mouths bleeding.

“Damn! How strong he is!” Fu Xingchen’s mind was filled with shock, his eyes wide with disbelief. He had not expected Luotian’s single punch to nearly break their formation.

Everyone was stunned by Luotian’s punch. Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang on the stands also bore expressions of disbelief.

They were prodigies of the royal family, renowned throughout the Origin Domain. Yet they did not believe themselves capable of breaking a formation with one punch.

“Mengchen is so strong!” Fu Xingyue’s face bore shock. The Luotian before her seemed like a different person, his growth too rapid.

“Do not let him live!” Fu Xingyang’s eyes flashed with killing intent. Among the three brothers, Fu Xingyang feared Fu Xingyue most; his cultivation was slightly higher. As for Fu Xingchen, Fu Xingyang had no regard for him.

Luotian’s emergence could change the balance of power within Fu Xingyue. If no mishaps occurred, Luotian would inevitably become a great power based on his current display.

“Have someone investigate this boy’s background, including all three generations!” Fu Tianba’s eyes gleamed as he spoke into the void.

“Hum…” Waves rose around Fu Tianba, unnoticed by anyone.

Luotian stood atop the sky, gazing at the blue star formation. His heart was filled with joy: “The power of Reincarnation Immortal Body!”

Luotian had not expected his punch to be so formidable. He had not even used the ‘One Force Breaks All’ technique or the ‘Buddha’s Attack’, yet it had achieved such results.

“I should unleash two great techniques. How strong would that be?” Luotian clenched his fists, eyes filled with anticipation.

“Roar…” As Luotian pondered, a roar rose behind him. The blood-red wolf opened its maw, as if devouring the heavens, lunging at Luotian, disproportionate to his size.

“Star Array Technique!” Luotian instantly turned, two Reincarnation Immortal Bodies in his dantian constantly forming seals. In an instant, pure Epoch power shot from Luotian’s hands like a flash.

A white hand, radiating overwhelming might, descended from the sky. It seemed like the hand of heaven itself, capable of plucking stars, reaching for the wolf formation.

“Final strike!” Fu Xingchen roared, his eyes wild with madness. He activated the stars, instantly appearing above Luotian to crush him.

“Let you feel despair!” Luotian did not resist. He ceased punching and ignored the approaching wolf, raising his hands to bear the star formation’s attack.

“Crush!” Fu Xingchen now fought with all his might, spitting blood. Simultaneously, all Star Soldiers also spat blood. The blue stars instantly turned crimson, their power intensifying further.

Fu Xingchen knew that even if he defeated Luotian, defeating Star Yang Guards would still be difficult. At this moment, Fu Xingchen hated Luotian more than ever and had resolved to kill him.

“Bloodthirsty Star Array! Is my third brother mad?” Fu Xingyue’s eyes flickered, his body moving to descend toward the ground. But as he took a step, Fu Tianba’s voice echoed in his mind.

“Nothing to worry about. I wish to see how far this boy can go!” Fu Tianba’s eyes gleamed with depth, halting Fu Xingyue.

“Roar…” At the same time, Luotian’s Star Array Technique struck the wolf formation.

The roar shook the heavens. The warriors within the wolf formation howled in pain, their cries echoing as they were halted by the white hand. Many of them fell from the sky.

“Bloodthirsty Star Array?” Luotian gazed at the crimson stars above, his eyes filled with killing intent. He could sense this attack’s might was overwhelming, as if even the elusive Dao would yield before it.

“Want to kill me? See if you have that strength!” Luotian maintained his stance, unwavering in confidence.

Chapter 1308: Turning the Tide

The crimson stars, radiating immense power, crashed toward Luotian. Fu Xingchen’s face bore a mad grin; he had truly resolved to kill Luotian.

In Fu Xingchen’s view, Luotian’s current strength was entirely due to the Reincarnation Scripture. That powerful technique had originally belonged to him.

The Bloodthirsty Star Array was a formation forged by the Star Soldiers through their blood, used to crush countless enemies throughout history. Yet this was the first time it had been employed in the Three Armies Competition, and its target was Luotian, the commander of the Star Moon Divine Clan.

In an instant, the crimson stars collided with Luotian’s hands. Thunderous clashes echoed as the crimson stars crushed Luotian, sending him plummeting to the ground with a resounding crash.

“Mengchen!” Fu Xingyue’s face darkened, his eyes red with fury. He watched the violent waves rise, even erasing one’s spiritual awareness.

“Alas… he is doomed,” people sighed. They knew this commander, though not dead, would suffer irreparable injuries.

“Alas…” Kou Tiande sighed deeply within the wolfhead formation, his voice laced with helplessness.

As a commander, Kou Tiande knew this was fate. One could not be too outstanding; excessive excellence would invite suspicion from the master.

“Commander!” The Star Moon Guards bore expressions of sorrow. They too had methods to fight with their lives, but they had not used them. After all, the Three Armies Competition had an unspoken rule: to avoid casualties as much as possible.

Blood erupted from the terrifying storm, instantly staining the ground red. People were awestruck.

“Hah! Want to kill me? You’ll need several thousand years of cultivation!” A cold laugh echoed through the crimson storm.

Sacred energy surged instantly. In the next moment, a white light shot from the crimson storm, revealing Luotian’s figure.

“No one is dead!” People gasped. Even Fu Tianba bore an expression of disbelief, gazing at the figure standing proudly in the sky.

“Who is he holding?” People soon noticed Luotian holding a person, both drenched in blood, their faces indistinct.

“Divine Emperor, I apologize. I had to fight back for my survival!” Luotian waved his hand, throwing the person onto the platform.

“Boom…” The bloodied figure fell before everyone. Upon recognizing his face, a collective gasp echoed through the Star Moon Divine Realm.

“Third Prince!” Someone spoke. Immediately, people rushed to his side to begin treatment.

“Hmph!” Fu Tianba sneered, watching Luotian’s defiant gaze. Their eyes met.

Luotian did not avert his gaze, locking eyes with Fu Tianba for several breaths before Fu Tianba finally withdrew his gaze.

“Continue!” Fu Tianba spoke softly, pointing a finger. Epoch energy shot from his hand into Fu Xingchen’s body, who was barely alive.

“This…!” Fu Xingyang was stunned for the first time. He had not expected Fu Xingchen to be so severely injured, yet Fu Tianba did not pursue it.

“How can we fight?” Many Star Yang Guards trembled, watching the wounded Star Soldiers on the ground. After that attack, many Star Soldiers had died or been severely injured, their limbs scattered.

“Surrender!” Fu Xingyang sighed deeply, transmitting to Kou Tiande. He did not wish for the Star Yang Guards to follow the same fate as the Star Soldiers.

“Star Yang Army surrenders!” Hearing Fu Xingyang’s words, Kou Tiande sighed in relief. His deep voice rang out.

“Hah!” Upon hearing Fu Tianba’s words, the one thousand Star Moon Guards erupted in cheers. Their eyes burned with fervor as they gazed at Luotian, drenched in blood.

“Hard work!” Fu Xingyue flew to Luotian’s side, her voice filled with surprise.

“Cough… cough…” Upon hearing the result, Luotian coughed up two mouthfuls of blood. His eyes rolled back as he fell to the ground.

Fu Xingyue swiftly caught Luotian, her eyes filled with worry. She then addressed Fu Tianba: “Your Majesty, the Star Moon Guards’ commander has suffered severe injuries. I shall take Mengchen back to recover!”

“Go ahead!” Fu Tianba waved his hand, gazing deeply at Luotian who was feigning unconsciousness. He spoke softly.

Fu Xingyue nodded, disappearing into the Star Moon Divine Realm with the support of her guards.

“Return to your posts. Star Yang, come with me!” Fu Tianba lifted Fu Xingchen and addressed Fu Xingyang.

“Yes!” Everyone bowed in reverence. Naturally, someone would clean the blood on the ground. Fu Xingyang bore a respectful expression as he followed Fu Tianba out of sight.

The entire Star Moon Divine Realm soon buzzed with discussion about the Three Armies Competition. The result was so unexpected; no one had imagined that two armies would be defeated by a single person. Since the inception of the Three Armies Competition, this was the first time such an outcome had occurred.

Fu Xingyue led Luotian and the pale but elated Star Moon Guards back to the Star Moon Pavilion. Immediately, all Star Moon Guards learned of Luotian’s victory, causing a frenzy among them.

As people returned from the Star Moon Divine Realm, everyone in the Star Moon City learned of the Three Armies Competition’s result. Though people had expected another victory for the Star Moon Guards, they had not anticipated this method—solely relying on their commander, Fu Mengchen, to turn the tide.

In an instant, Fu Mengchen’s name became the focus of attention in the Star Moon City. Singlehandedly defeating two armies, his strength was now spoken of as legendary.

“Did you hear? The Star Moon City’s commander singlehandedly shattered the Third Prince’s star formation with one punch!”

“You just found out? I heard Fu Commander roared and shattered the wolf formation, making Kou Commander surrender!”

“Fu Commander could be called the strongest commander in Star Moon Divine Clan history!” People gossiped, praising Luotian’s strength.

At the same time, Fu Xingyue’s name rose with this battle. Rumors of Luotian possibly betraying Fu Xingyue were also dispelled by this battle.

Meanwhile, Luotian stood in his courtyard. His injuries were all feigned.

“Alas…” Luotian stood in the courtyard, listening to the rumors spreading through the Star Moon City. His face bore a wry smile; he had become too noticeable again.

On the other hand, in Fu Tianba’s palace, Fu Tianba sat with a stern expression. Before him stood Fu Xingyang, his face filled with respect. Fu Xingchen lay pale and lifeless beside him, his eyes brimming with hatred.

“Both of you—do you now accept it?” Fu Tianba spoke softly, his voice laced with a smile.

“Not at all! If I had entered the Epoch Initial, this boy would be nothing!” Fu Xingchen lay there, shouting.

Hearing Fu Xingchen’s words, Fu Xingyang’s eyes flickered with disdain before he addressed Fu Tianba: “Father, why did you summon us? Let’s not beat around the bush!”

Seeing Fu Xingyang’s composure, Fu Tianba nodded. Among his three sons, Fu Xingyang was the most satisfactory. Yet Fu Xingyang was too deep; sometimes Fu Tianba could not fathom what his son was thinking, giving him a sense of being out of control.

“I’ll give you one last chance to compete,” Fu Tianba spoke softly, his voice laced with a smile.

Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingchen, hearing Fu Tianba’s words, both trembled. Their gazes turned serious as they looked at Fu Tianba.

“Wait until Star Yang’s injuries heal. Open the Thundering Palace. This time, it is not about who collects more moonstone; I will place the Star Moon Divine Emperor’s Seal within the Thundering Palace. Whoever obtains the Star Moon Divine Emperor’s Seal will replace me!” Fu Tianba smiled, addressing them.

Hearing Fu Tianba’s words, Fu Xingyang and Fu Xingchen’s breaths quickened. The Star Moon Divine Emperor’s Seal was the symbol of the entire Star Moon Divine Clan.

Since the time when the King led the Star Moon Divine Clan to become a royal family, they had forged one Star Moon Divine Emperor’s Seal. It was passed down through generations. Possessing the Star Moon Divine Emperor’s Seal meant possessing control over the entire Star Moon Divine Clan.

Because the Star Moon Divine Emperor’s Seal had a miraculous effect, it could unleash the potential of the Star Moon Divine Clan, increasing their combat power by thirty percent. Moreover, anyone within the Star Moon Divine Clan would have their strength reduced by thirty percent before the one holding the Star Moon Divine Emperor’s Seal.

“Since both of you failed in this competition, I will give you a chance. This news will be announced three days later to the Star Moon City. How you seize it is up to yourselves!” Fu Tianba spoke softly.

“Yes!” Fu Xingyang and the pale Fu Xingchen bowed, their eyes gleaming with intensity. They rose to leave.

As soon as they left Fu Tianba’s residence, they exchanged glances before their figures vanished toward the Merit Hall.

“Entering the Thundering Palace requires one million merits! I must gather as many people with one million merits as possible during this time. This time in the Thundering Palace, I will kill that Fu Mengchen!” Fu Xingchen’s mind roared.

Chapter 1309: The Fertilizer Commander

In the Star Moon City, three days had passed since the Three Armies Competition. The most discussed topic was Fu Mengchen, the commander of the Star Moon Guards. Yet for these three days, this so-called strongest commander had vanished from people’s sight.

In the Alchemy Hall, Luotian stood with a grim expression, holding a bucket of green liquid. He muttered continuously, his eyes filled with bitterness.

“I am the commander of the Star Moon Guards! I am even a disciple of the previous Star Moon Divine Emperor!” Luotian felt the pungent odor from the green liquid, his heart crying out.

“Fu Xingxuan, I’ve never endured such humiliation in my life. One day, I’ll make you carry two buckets!” Luotian’s mind roared as he approached a medicinal herb field, pouring the bucket of fertilizer into it.

The day after feigning his recovery, Fu Xingxuan had found him and dragged him to the Alchemy Hall.

Luotian had considered resisting, but upon seeing Fu Xingxuan’s hundreds of followers and her status, he could only endure the humiliation.

Luotian knew that by defeating Fu Xingchen in the Three Armies Competition, he had already drawn Fu Tianba’s suspicion. If he further offended this treasure of the Star Moon Divine Clan, he would truly provoke everyone’s anger.

Reluctantly, Luotian chose to endure. After being summoned to the Alchemy Hall, Fu Xingxuan assigned him the task of watering medicinal herbs with fertilizer and left. She also forbade him from using his cultivation, claiming it was to hone his patience under her title of elder sister.

“Fu Xingxuan, you are a devil! My alchemy skills are better than yours even with my eyes closed!” Luotian muttered, approaching the manure pit again. He carefully scooped up the bucket.

“Plop…” As Luotian just placed the bucket into the pit, a large stone fell from the sky, splashing manure everywhere. Luotian was beside the pit.

“Who!” Luotian’s eyes flashed with anger, his figure vanishing instantly before he gazed at the sky.

“I!” Fu Xingxuan stood in the sky, a triumphant smile on her face. Her purple eyes scrutinized Luotian.

“Ah! My beautiful elder sister!” Luotian’s angry expression turned into a smile, gazing at Fu Xingxuan who was perfect in the sky.

“Hmm, how about you didn’t slack off?” Fu Xingxuan smiled seductively as she approached Luotian.

“No, elder sister’s orders—how could I slack off! Fertilizer Commander!” Luotian patted his chest. Over these two days, he had figured out the girl’s temperament—she needed to be flattered. The more he resisted, the more she would find ways to torment him.

At first, Luotian had been assigned weeding. But his initial reaction was refusal. Fu Xingxuan then summoned Fu Tianqing, and naturally, Luotian lost, changing from weeding to carrying fertilizer.

“Witch! One day I’ll crush you under this manure pit! Crush it for a hundred years!” Luotian’s mind cursed, but his face wore an obsequious smile.

“Elder sister, why did you have time to supervise your younger brother? I thought the sun was so bright today!” Luotian addressed Fu Xingxuan, constantly fawning.

“Hmm, I just had nothing to do today. So I came to check if you were slacking off! Also, stop carrying fertilizer. I have another task for you!” Fu Xingxuan crossed her arms, her arms pressing against her chest, making Luotian momentarily dazed.

“Where are you looking!” Seeing Luotian’s gaze, Fu Xingxuan glared, her face turning angry. Her cheeks were slightly red, whether from anger or other reasons was unclear.

Fu Xingxuan then appeared beside Luotian. Her jade hand reached out, twisting his ear. This action reminded Luotian of the four women—Gu Qianxue, and he did not resist. His eyes showed a softness.

“Hmm?” Fu Xingxuan, seeing no reaction from Luotian, looked puzzled. She then gazed at him and saw the softness in his eyes. She tightened her grip, but Luotian still showed no reaction.

“What’s wrong with you?” Fu Xingxuan released Luotian, asking him in confusion.

“Nothing. It’s my fault. Elder sister is too beautiful; I couldn’t help but be distracted. Please forgive me, elder sister!” Luotian felt somewhat uncomfortable, yet his words were still flattering.

“Alas… it’s been two or three years since I left the Nine Realms. I wonder how my family is doing! Has Luoli grown taller? Did Guzu take Xiting back yet? Do they know I’m still alive?” Luotian felt a wistful sorrow, sighing deeply.

“Hmph! Alright, I’ll forgive you this time!” Fu Xingxuan, unsure why she felt pity for Luotian’s distracted expression, did not harshly reprimand him.

“Who is that? Isn’t that the commander of the Star Moon Guards Fu Mengchen? How come he’s here in the Alchemy Hall?” Fu Xingxuan’s words had just finished when a group of figures appeared in Luotian and Fu Xingxuan’s sight, their eyes filled with curiosity.

“Ah! These past days, Fu Commander was here in the Alchemy Hall?” People looked at Luotian and Fu Xingxuan with understanding.

“Why are you staring? Haven’t you seen an elder sister reprimanding her younger brother before?” Fu Xingxuan, seeing the people in the sky with impatience, scolded them. These were her admirers, always like flies following her.

“What? Younger brother? Fu Commander has become a disciple of the old Divine Emperor?” Hearing Fu Xingxuan’s words, people gasped. Their eyes turned surprised.

“Oops! I slipped up!” Fu Xingxuan playfully made a face at Luotian before straightening her expression.

“Yes, the old Divine Emperor is my grandfather. He took your Fu Commander as a disciple. As his elder sister, I naturally can reprimand him!” Fu Xingxuan’s eyes gleamed with triumph.

“My heavens! There is no justice in this world. Why didn’t I think of it? Becoming a disciple of the old Divine Emperor naturally gives you opportunities to get close to Princess Xingxuan!” Upon hearing Fu Xingxuan’s words, people erupted in chatter. Their eyes turned respectful toward Luotian, not expecting him to have thought of such a method.

“Damn it!” Luotian muttered under his breath, not expecting people to be so absurd.

“Alright, let’s go!” Fu Xingxuan was also speechless at these people. She addressed Luotian, swaying her tiny waist as she walked into the inner hall of the Alchemy Hall.

“I’ll go to be a disciple! The Alchemy Hall is currently cold. I think the old Divine Emperor will accept me. After all, I know a little about alchemy!”

“Hmph! Just because you can’t even compare to me, I am a first-rate alchemist. The old Divine Emperor will definitely accept me!” People immediately clamored, rushing toward the main hall of alchemy.

“Don’t dream it! If the commander has already acted, do you think you can beat him?” A Star Moon Guard bore admiration on his face as he watched Luotian and Fu Xingxuan disappear.

Hearing the Star Moon Guard’s words, people fell silent for a moment. But soon their faces turned resolute: “It's not about status or strength, but character!”

“Yes! I’ve liked Princess Xingxuan for years. How could I give up now!” Each admirer found their confidence again, shouting.

“I don’t even expect the princess to choose me. Even seeing her from afar for a few glances would satisfy me!” A young man shouted, his figure darting toward the lifeless Fu Tianqing before kneeling at his feet.

“Old Divine Emperor, I wish to cultivate alchemy. Please accept me as your disciple!” The young man shouted loudly, his voice thunderous enough to startle Fu Tianqing.

“Old Divine Emperor, I also wish to cultivate alchemy. Accept me!” Immediately, over a thousand people knelt on the ground before Fu Tianqing, begging him to accept them as disciples.

“Damn! Is it Xingxuan’s idea again!” Fu Tianqing looked at the dense crowd of people kneeling on the ground, his mouth twitching. The number of people kept increasing, leaving Fu Tianqing speechless.

“Who came up with this idea!” Fu Tianqing sat upright, his gaze scanning the people kneeling before him. He spoke coldly.

“It’s the commander of the Star Moon Guards! Old Divine Emperor, please accept me. My strength is not as good as the commander’s, but I also yearn for alchemy!” A young man shouted.

“Fu Mengchen!” Fu Tianqing gritted his teeth, watching the increasing number of people. He felt a headache and scanned through the crowd.

“Nonsense! You think I let this Alchemy Hall be a place for you!” Fu Tianqing’s aura rose gradually, his voice cold as he addressed these people who did not take alchemy seriously and had other intentions.

Fu Tianqing’s cultivation was such that no one in the Star Moon Divine Clan could withstand his anger. His pressure was beyond what these aristocrats could endure, causing them to tremble in fear.

“However, you do have a chance. I’ve never cleaned this Alchemy Hall for years. Some herbs are also neglected,” Fu Tianqing sighed, addressing the crowd.

Upon hearing Fu Tianqing’s words, these aristocrats immediately felt energized. They scattered to clean the Alchemy Hall.

“Xiao Ding, do you have any news?” As soon as they entered the inner hall, Fu Xingxuan asked Luotian.

“Ah… my elder sister, it’s truly not there!” Luotian bore a respectful expression. He had not expected Fu Xingxuan to be so persistent.

“Hmm, then you don’t need to carry fertilizer. Go find him for me. When you find Xiao Ding, come back!” Fu Xingxuan thought for a moment. Though she found Luotian amusing, she was more determined to find the annoying Xiao Ding who had ignored her.

“Dear little sister, this time he might not be able to help you find people!” Fu Xingxuan’s words had just finished when Fu Xingyue entered with a serious expression.

Chapter 1310: Competing for Merits

“Why? You promised me, after the Three Armies Competition, I would handle this commander!” Fu Xingxuan’s face bore annoyance. She had already planned to torment these two after Luotian found Xiao Ding.

“I just returned from my father!” Fu Xingyue sighed deeply, gazing at Fu Xingxuan.

“What’s wrong? Is there something important?” Fu Xingxuan also sensed the sigh in Fu Xingyue’s voice, her face turning serious.

“His expression changed so quickly! Your acting is second only to mine!” Luotian gazed at Fu Xingxuan, sighing deeply. His gaze also turned to Fu Xingyue.

“The Thundering Palace is opening!” Fu Xingyue spoke softly. Upon hearing this, her heart was filled with joy.

The Thundering Palace—the greatest purpose of Luotian’s arrival in the Star Moon Divine Clan was to enter it, to see how the entrance to the Nine Realms was sealed.

“Ah, this time the Thundering Palace opens, it will finally decide who sits in that position!” Fu Xingyue sighed deeply, her voice laced with bitterness.

“What’s wrong? It seems good! Considering strength, our current strength is definitely stronger than the eldest and second prince!” Luotian’s eyes showed confusion, gazing at Fu Xingyue.

“Indeed! Brother, you should be gentle with me!” Fu Xingxuan smiled, addressing Fu Xingyue.

“You should also know that the Thundering Palace opens with one million merits to enter. I arrived at the Thundering Palace immediately after receiving the news, first to see how many people exceeded one million merits and second to try to recruit those with over one million merits.”

“Isn’t that good?” Luotian and Fu Xingxuan were confused by Fu Xingyue’s expression.

“Throughout the Star Moon Divine Clan, merits over one million have inexplicably surged to more than twenty! Half of these twenty people are new, and their strength is at least half-step Epoch Initial.”

“I also tried to approach these people but received an answer: they were all recruited by my eldest and third brother!” Fu Xingyue’s face bore bitterness.

“Such a lot?” Hearing Fu Xingyue’s words, Luotian felt his heart sink. He understood the severity of the situation.

“Why is this so? It’s unfair for brother!” Fu Xingxuan’s face also changed, gazing at Fu Xingyue before continuing.

“I’ll go find my father and change the rules!” Fu Xingxuan’s face was puffed up. Though she did not want her three brothers to compete, there was no choice but to make the competition as fair as possible.

“No use. I already went and asked!” Fu Xingyue sighed, recalling what Fu Tianba had said to her.

“This is your test. As a royal, you must find solutions for any difficulties and should not complain about the unfairness of rules. That is the behavior of a weakling!” Fu Tianba had harshly sent Fu Xingyue away.
