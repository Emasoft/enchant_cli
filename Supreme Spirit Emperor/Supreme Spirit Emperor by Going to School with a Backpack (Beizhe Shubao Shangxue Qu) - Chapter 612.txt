Amidst the towering mountains and steep ridges, Zhou Zhiwen and his five companions moved swiftly, continuously weaving through the terrain. At times, they would halt to let Zhou Zhiwen consult the map, steadily advancing deeper into Huanmo Ridge.

After two hours of travel, the sky gradually darkened, and they paused within a dense forest where towering trees surrounded them.

“Assuming this map is correct, we may encounter some ferocious beasts ahead. Once we break through this forest, it will be only an hour’s journey to Elder Xinmo’s cave!” Zhou Zhiwen addressed the group.

Gu Qianxue felt no abnormalities on her body, while Buxian Shi (Supplemental Heaven Stone) was currently attached to her shoulder. Luotian stood there, his face marked by solemnity.

“It’s not right; the demonic energy here is very dense!” Luotian muttered internally, recalling his past encounters with demon dens. Though the demonic energy here was not as thick as in the world of the Demon Realm, if prolonged exposure occurred, these ferocious beasts might have already been corrupted.

“Roar……” As Luotian grew concerned, a series of guttural roars echoed from the forest’s depths. Though daylight had not fully faded, the trees in Huanmo Ridge were so tall they blocked even the last slivers of sunlight, plunging the entire forest into darkness.

The roars deepened the group’s apprehension; the sounds were extremely harrowing, sending shivers down their spines.

“Be careful! Follow me!” Zhou Zhiwen urged, stepping forward into the forest’s depths.

“Wum……” Just as they began moving, a black divine light suddenly shot out, swiftly appearing beside Zhou Zhiwen. Three streaks of cold light flashed toward his chest.

“What is this!” Zhou Zhiwen’s heart raced, but his reflexes were quick; divine light radiated from his body, illuminating him entirely.

“Zhi……” A piercing sound echoed at Zhou Zhiwen’s chest, three bloodstreaks appearing on his torso. A flash of black light vanished, leaving Zhou Zhiwen wiping sweat from his face, his gaze fixed on the forest’s depths. That moment had nearly cost him dearly if he had reacted even a fraction slower.

“Did you see what it was?” Zhou Zhiwen quickly gathered with Gu Qianxue and the others, eyes cautious as they scanned their surroundings.

“It was a cat! If I’m not mistaken, it’s a Fascinating Cat—likely corrupted by demonic energy!” Gu Qianxue replied, her tone heavy with concern.

“Fascinating Cats aren’t creatures of the Underworld? How come they’re here?” Upon hearing Gu Qianxue’s words, Zhou Zhiwen and the others shuddered slightly.

“Who said only the Underworld has ghostly beings? The Celestial Realm also harbors many!” Gu Qianxue spoke softly.

“Roar……” As Gu Qianxue’s words faded, another black light shot toward them—this time targeting Gu Qianxue.

“Die!” Luotian muttered internally, his Yugui Yin (Ghost-Controlling Seal) energy surging from his body toward the dark light.

The rapid black light halted abruptly, and Gu Qianxue extended her hand, dark energy swirling as her pristine palm, now covered in scales, grasped the approaching black light.

A harrowing scream echoed among them as a dark figure materialized in Gu Qianxue’s grip.

The black ghost claws glowed faintly, revealing a two-foot-long black feline, its neck clutched by Gu Qianxue as it writhed.

“The Fascinating Cat, one of the four ghostly beings—Fascination, Darkness, Illusion, and Fear. It excels in speed and attacks with sharp claws,” Gu Qianxue explained softly, clearly well-versed in the creature.

Gu Qianxue furrowed her brows; she had clearly sensed the Fascinating Cat’s speed falter, as if it had collided with her hand.

“Someone is secretly interfering!” Gu Qianxue’s gaze swept the surroundings, landing on Fu Bei.

Fu Bei, noticing Gu Qianxue’s gaze, smiled gently, giving her the impression that he was aiding her.

“Idiotic wife!” Luotian cursed internally, feeling that Gu Qianxue’s intellect had declined during their separation. Could Fu Bei truly possess such strength?

“Puff…” Gu Qianxue said nothing, crushing the Fascinating Cat in her grasp. Black ghost energy enveloped her body as a black inner pearl materialized in her hand.

“This inner pearl of a ghostly being is a great nourishment for other ghosts!” Gu Qianxue spoke softly, storing the pearl.

“Master Gu, please hand over this inner pearl to me; it is a most malevolent object!” Jie Du (Buddhist Monk) requested softly, his gaze on Gu Qianxue.

“Indeed, there are ghostly beings here! But where do they originate?” Luotian mused internally, his gaze fixed on the forest’s depths, occasionally hearing ghostly cries.

“Let’s go; be cautious!” Zhou Zhiwen sighed internally, regretting bringing Gu Qianxue, the ghost cultivator. Indeed, without her ability to sense the Fascinating Cat’s presence, though it wouldn’t harm them, it would have been a thorn in their side. The speed of the Fascinating Cat had even made it difficult for Zhou Zhiwen to intercept.

As for Jie Du’s request, Gu Qianxue ignored it entirely, instead standing beside Fu Bei and walking alongside him.

The group re-entered the forest, advancing toward Huanmo Ridge’s depths. As they walked, they spotted a river in the forest’s heart, its waters flowing ceaselessly. The river’s color was black, with occasional wisps of dark mist rising from its surface.

On the river’s opposite bank stood a black plant, radiating a faint glow. The plant was no shorter than trees; it had three leaves, with the rest resembling a trunk, yet its branches were covered in countless tiny flowers.

“Feng Huanzi (Wind Illusion Grass)! It can induce illusions!” Yin Xiu’s eyes gleamed with joy, gazing at the black plant and shouting.

“Feng Huanzi is the main ingredient for the Illusion Heart Pill! With this, I can craft the Heaven-Defying Pill. Though it is a five-star elixir, it has miraculous effects—placing the user in their own illusion!” Yin Xiu spoke, leaping into action toward Feng Huanzi.

“Rippling….” However, as Yin Xiu moved, the black river emitted a series of water sounds. A massive black serpent burst from the stream, lunging toward Yin Xiu.

As the black serpent emerged, the river’s water reverted to its original color, surprising Luotian.

Ten zhang… one hundred zhang…
Over two hundred zhang in length, the serpent’s massive body surpassed even Long Jie’s size. Its maw yawned wide, sharp fangs glistening with cold light—Luotian doubted Yin Xiu’s frail body could withstand a single bite.

Yin Xiu’s face contorted in panic, gazing at the approaching maw and tossing out a pill from his hand. It exploded violently.

“Boom…” The black elixir transformed into a terrifying explosion, tearing through the serpent’s maw and sending gouts of blood flying.

“Seven-Defeat Ghost Snake!” Gu Qianxue gasped, watching the colossal serpent’s body and eyes wide with disbelief.

“Is this the Underworld? So many ghostly beings!” Fu Bei shouted, stepping in front of Gu Qianxue. His golden divine sword radiated a blinding light, slicing toward the serpent’s tail.

“Crack…” Sparks flew as Fu Bei’s golden sword carved a bloodstreak on the serpent’s tail. However, Fu Bei was thrown back by the snake’s strike, colliding with and breaking numerous trees.

A gust of wind swept through, agitating Feng Huanzi’s flowers. Black petals drifted into the air, enveloping a vast area in darkness.

“Don’t inhale the petals; they’ll draw you into an illusion!” Yin Xiu’s face darkened, dodging the black serpent as it lunged again.

Though his words were swift, he was still too slow—except for Yin Xiu, Zhou Zhiwen and Fu Bei inhaled copious amounts of the petals.

In an instant, Zhou Zhiwen and Gu Qianxue froze, their bodies rigid, eyes turning black.

“Damn it!” Yin Xiu cursed internally, forming hand seals while a green great cauldron emerged from his control. It expanded violently, crushing the black serpent.

A green hand extended, grasping for the ghost snake’s vital point.

“Wum…” However, the thick serpent tail lashed through space, sweeping toward Yin Xiu again.

Yin Xiu brandished another long sword in his other hand, meeting the serpent’s tail. He was thrown back again, landing awkwardly on the ground.

“Boom… boom…” Meanwhile, the green hand clamped onto the ghost snake’s vital point. The serpent writhed violently, its massive body colliding wildly and turning the surrounding hundred zhang into ruins.

“Wum…” In its chaotic flailing, the black serpent tail finally struck the group.

Zhou Zhiwen, Jie Du, and Fu Bei were hit in succession, spitting blood as their bodies cracked. Yet they showed no signs of regaining consciousness.

“Stop it!” Yin Xiu roared, enduring the pain and maintaining his grip on the ghost snake’s vital point.

“Boom… boom…” But the serpent’s tail repeatedly struck Yin Xiu, causing him to spit blood profusely.

After over a dozen strikes, Yin Xiu could no longer endure; the green hand shattered violently, and he staggered back.

“I can’t hold it! Forgive me!” Yin Xiu spoke, spitting out blood. His body radiated green energy as he闪动 (shimmered) toward Huanmo Ridge’s depths.

Yin Xiu’s speed was swift; the ghost snake, seeing him flee, did not pursue but instead coiled toward Gu Qianxue, who had remained untouched. Its maw lunged toward her.

“Such a useless person!” Luotian cursed internally, instantly donning his Thousand-Image Mask. His appearance shifted wildly as he materialized beside Gu Qianxue.

Chapter 2313: Break Out ()

As Luotian appeared, the massive black serpent materialized before him. Its maw exuded a foul stench.

Yet the ghost snake seemed startled by Luotian’s sudden appearance, its body pausing slightly.

“Die!” Luotian punched forward, a black fist striking the serpent’s head with a crisp crack. The serpent roared, its massive head recoiling.

“Boom…” Luotian stomped the ground, sending shards flying as he leapt onto the serpent’s head. His foot crushed down on its skull, driving it into the earth.

“Who dares!” Luotian spoke coldly, his wrist flashing black light as two large dogs emerged.

“Woof… woof…” The two dogs, Dahei and Erhei, were the pair Luotian had not summoned in a while.

Upon their emergence, an overwhelming pressure radiated from them. The black ghost snake trembled.

“Eat this serpent!” Luotian commanded the two dogs, ignoring the ghost snake and leaping toward the river’s opposite bank. He materialized before the towering Feng Huanzi.

“Induces illusions, even Gu Qianxue and the others were caught!” Luotian mused internally, observing Feng Huanzi. He formed hand seals, divine patterns etching onto the plant’s massive trunk.

“Wum…” The vibrations from Feng Huanzi rippled outward, gradually diminishing under Luotian’s gaze. He stored it away.

“Keep it; it’s rare. Perhaps it’ll be useful later!” Luotian mused, his gaze turning to Dahei and Erhei, who had already torn apart the Seven-Defeat Ghost Snake.

Golden light radiated from Jie Du’s body as he recited Buddhist scriptures, his eyes gradually trembling.

“Don’t eat it; let’s go!” Luotian waved his hand, recalling Dahei and Erhei. He returned to Buxian Shi, landing on Gu Qianxue’s shoulder.

“Huff…” As Luotian landed, Jie Du opened his eyes, his gaze now clear.

“Close call!” Jie Du muttered softly, his expression filled with caution—a first for Luotian to see such a look in Jie Du’s eyes.

“Is this man not supposed to be free of desires? Why was he ensnared by the illusion?” Luotian mused coldly.

Gu Qianxue’s body trembled violently before relaxing, relieving Luotian.

“What happened?” Gu Qianxue mused internally, her eyes puzzled as she recalled the illusion’s scenes.

“How did I encounter that little person?” Gu Qianxue puzzled, having experienced much in the illusion. Yet what surprised her most was encountering Luotian and doing many things with him—she had always despised Luotian.

“Qianxue, are you alright?” As Gu Qianxue blushed with shame, Fu Bei also awoke and approached her, placing his hand on her shoulder.

“I’m fine…” Gu Qianxue’s body shivered slightly, resisting Fu Bei’s hand and shaking her head.

“Everyone alright? That was terrifying!” Zhou Zhiwen and Hunxuan awoke in succession, their brows drenched in sweat.

“Useless bunch! We haven’t even reached Elder Xinmo’s cave yet, just the outer perimeter. We almost got wiped out! If I hadn’t been here, you useless ones would’ve dragged Qianxue down!” Luotian cursed internally, wanting to rip Fu Bei’s hands off.

“What happened? Where is the Seven-Defeat Ghost Snake?” They soon realized, observing the chaos on the ground and the black blood staining it.

“Feng Huanzi and Yin Xiu are gone!” Hunxuan gasped, gazing at the spot where Feng Huanzi had been.

“Did Yin Xiu kill the Seven-Defeat Ghost Snake and take Feng Huanzi alone?” Zhou Zhiwen’s face darkened.

“Perhaps something unexpected happened!” Gu Qianxue shook her head, gazing at the Seven-Defeat Ghost Snake’s scales.

“Shall we continue? We haven’t even reached Elder Xinmo’s cave yet, and already faced such danger. If we go deeper, it might be even more perilous!” Fu Bei spoke, gazing at Zhou Zhiwen.

“Earlier we were careless; if we’re careful now, it should be fine!” Zhou Zhiwen replied. He knew Gu Qianxue and the others would continue, as they were all prodigies with pride.

Yet Zhou Zhiwen felt regret for expelling Luotian from the group; with him, they would have had a stronger ally.

They regrouped, proceeding cautiously into the forest’s depths. They encountered two more corrupted ghostly beings but managed to defeat them, no longer as chaotic as before.

Time passed; they walked another hour in the forest without encountering any ghostly beings, yet a heavy atmosphere grew denser, like the calm before a storm. Gu Qianxue and the others felt their apprehension deepen.

“Did you sense anything wrong?” Zhou Zhiwen halted, gazing at the forest’s edge. Though they were about to exit it, a sense of danger lingered outside.

“Indeed; I felt it too. We can still retreat!” Fu Bei spoke softly, though they were all prodigies with hidden cards. Yet the Seven-Defeat Ghost Snake had left them deeply shaken, nearly costing them their lives.

“Yin Xiu should have escaped; if he could, we should be fine!” Zhou Zhiwen spoke, determined to claim the Huanmo Stone.

“Let’s go; let’s see what demons or ghosts await!” Gu Qianxue spoke coldly, stepping forward first toward the forest’s edge.

“Qianxue, wait for me! I’ll go with you!” Fu Bei shouted, following Gu Qianxue. Hunxuan glanced at Fu Bei but said nothing.

“I’ve smelled demonic energy…” Jie Du spoke softly, his eyes resolute as he recited scriptures and followed the group.

“Rustle… rustle…” As they stepped out of the forest’s edge, a series of rustling sounds echoed from outside.

“What is it?” Hunxuan’s eyes widened in disbelief, exclaiming.

“Crack…” As Hunxuan’s words faded, a three-foot-long black creature crawled into the forest.

“This… is a Corpse-Eater Ghost?” Gu Qianxue paused, gazing at the ghostly creature shrouded in black mist. Her eyes narrowed slightly.

“No, it’s a corrupted Corpse-Eater Ghost—far stronger than normal ones!” Gu Qianxue spoke in disbelief, staring at its mouth full of teeth, capable of tearing anything apart.

“This thing is weak!” Fu Bei’s eyes flashed with disdain as his golden divine sword radiated a brilliant light, slicing toward the Corpse-Eater Ghost.

“Puff…” The black ghost was instantly severed in two, its dark demonic blood splattering the ground. Though corrupted, it was much stronger than a normal Corpse-Eater Ghost; however, Fu Bei’s strength as a True Immortal Peak was enough to kill it effortlessly.

As the ghost died, the rustling sounds grew more urgent—one… ten… countless Corpse-Eater Ghosts crawled into the forest, devouring the corpse instantly.

“So many…” Their faces paled; layers of Corpse-Eater Ghosts swarmed toward Gu Qianxue and the others.

“Retreat!” Zhou Zhiwen shouted, leaping back along their path.

“But there’s also something behind!” Zhou Zhiwen halted as earth-shaking sounds echoed, black Corpse-Eater Ghosts bursting from the ground. They surrounded Zhou Zhiwen and the others.

“Break out!” Hunxuan roared, brandishing two gray long swords and rushing toward the Corpse-Eater Ghosts outside.

“Puff… puff…” The gray swords whirled with wind, instantly cutting down many Corpse-Eater Ghosts. Yet Hunxuan’s steps were halted.

Others also launched attacks; with no escape, they could only break out or retreat. But the countless Corpse-Eater Ghosts were overwhelming, leaving them stuck.

“This won’t work!” Fu Bei shouted, standing beside Gu Qianxue. He noticed her pressure was lighter.

“What did you all come for!” Luotian sighed internally, watching Zhou Zhiwen and the others trapped. They were truly exasperating.

“Alas…” Luotian sighed, seeing everyone gather around Gu Qianxue, increasing her pressure. He felt exasperated and released Yugui Yin’s energy.

“Roar…” As Yugui Yin’s energy spread, the Corpse-Eater Ghosts abruptly halted, as if encountering something terrifying. They avoided Gu Qianxue, leaving a vacuum wherever she went.

“This…” Gu Qianxue’s eyes widened in confusion, while the others’ faces lit up with joy.

“Master Gu, lead us out!” Zhou Zhiwen shouted at Gu Qianxue. She snapped back to reality, gazing at Fu Bei’s smiling face and stepping toward the forest’s edge.

“Idiot, you’ve finally thought of that bastard!” Luotian cursed internally, also scolding Fu Bei for taking credit.

Numerous Corpse-Eater Ghosts dared not approach Gu Qianxue, as if honoring a sovereign. They cleared a path for her and the others to escape toward the forest’s depths.

Chapter 2314: Dream ()

Breaking free from the Corpse-Eater Ghosts’ encirclement, a black cave appeared before Gu Qianxue and the others. Their faces lit up with joy.

A black mountain cave, its interior emitting roaring sounds and cold winds. Their expressions slightly faltered.

“Huanmo Cave—this must be the entrance! Once we pass through Huanmo Cave, we’ll find Elder Xinmo’s cave!” Zhou Zhiwen addressed the group, his eyes filled with excitement.

He knew that entering Huanmo Cave would plunge them into an illusion; the Huanmo Stone was within it. Once they found it, they could escape the illusion.

“Another illusion! Elder Xinmo truly excels in illusions!” The group murmured, their faces filled with admiration.

“Indeed; this Huanmo Cave must be more terrifying than Feng Huanzi’s illusion!” Zhou Zhiwen’s gaze was heavy.

“Everyone, once we retrieve the Huanmo Stone, I promise not to disappoint you. Please follow me into this cave!” Zhou Zhiwen urged the group.

“Good!” Hunxuan nodded, having come this far; they wouldn’t stop without rewards.

Luotian stood on Gu Qianxue’s shoulder, gazing at the dark cave. He finally felt a sense of danger.

“The entrance to Elder Xinmo’s cave is truly no simple matter!” Luotian mused internally. If he had been alone, he might have stopped here due to the danger. But with Gu Qianxue entering, he could only follow and protect her safety.

As Luotian pondered, Zhou Zhiwen and the others stepped into the dark cave. Luotian’s vision dimmed accordingly.

As Gu Qianxue and the others stepped into the cave, a downward force pressed upon Luotian’s body. It was pressure—uncontrollable, as if an invisible hand pressed upon their bodies, including Luotian even while on Buxian Shi.

“It’s the Heavenly and Earthly Momentum! A natural formation!” Luotian was stunned internally. Natural formations like this were the most formidable.

Endless darkness enveloped Luotian, obscuring Gu Qianxue’s presence and causing him to feel anxious.

“Buxian Shi, what’s happening?” Luotian shouted internally, trying to contact Buxian Shi but receiving no response.

Luotian’s body continued descending, enveloped by darkness and solitude. Simultaneously, he worried about Gu Qianxue.

“Open!” After what felt like an eternity, Luotian still had no sense of time. He finally couldn’t endure and launched attacks repeatedly—various martial arts from his hands, attempting to shatter the void.

Yet he found that even this space could not be disturbed.

“How is this possible? I am a True Immortal Peak powerhouse; even if the Celestial Realm’s rules are strong, I should be able to shatter space. Why can’t I stir even a ripple here?” Luotian mused internally, gazing at the endless darkness.

“With Heavenly and Earthly Momentum combined with illusions, it can achieve such terrifying power! Even an Immortal King would fall for it. These people are truly reckless!” Luotian cursed internally, continuing to attack with martial arts, attempting to break the dark space.

Time passed slowly; Luotian didn’t know how long he had been falling, but he gradually felt weak and his head heavy. His eyelids closed involuntarily.

As Luotian closed his eyes, a sharp pain surged in his head as if something was stirring within it. He let out loud cries, and waves of memories flooded his mind.

“Chen Tianxin, sixteen years old, son of the Master of Zhongtian’s Illusion Sect. A prodigy, but at fifteen, he was struck by a black lightning bolt and thereafter fell ill!” A stream of information flooded Luotian’s mind.

“Hmph…” Dazed, Luotian didn’t know how long it had been until he heard voices calling. His body gradually regained sensation, and he slowly opened his eyes.

Upon opening them, he saw a clean room, his face bewildered. A man and woman smiled warmly at him.

“Tianxin, you’ve finally awakened! How do you feel?” The woman’s face was gentle, familiar to Luotian.

“Who are you?” Luotian asked, gazing at the woman with a sense of familiarity.

“Am I not your mother? Tianxin, you don’t recognize me?” The woman spoke again, her eyes filled with disbelief.

“Xiao Xin, don’t panic; Tianxin has done this before. Give him some time and he’ll be fine!” The man sighed, addressing the woman.

“Chen Badian, Master of the Illusion Sect, an Immortal Early Peak!” Luotian’s mind automatically generated this information.

“Father and mother…” Luotian gazed at the two, speaking softly. It wasn’t that they were unkind; it was just their appearance was too similar to Luonantian’s.

“Tianxin, do you know us?” The woman, hearing Luotian’s words, looked excited and pulled his hand.

“I…?” Luotian glanced around, noticing his clothes had changed, his storage ring too. Even his appearance had altered slightly, as if he were another person entirely.

“Am I being possessed?” Luotian suddenly stood up, gazing around and at his reflection in the mirror.

Round face, high hair bun, dark eyes with sharpness, and his body radiated True Immortal power. Yet his cultivation was True Immortal Late Stage.

“Where are Dahei and Erhei? Where is Buxian Shi? Where is Longyuan Sword?” Luotian’s heart panicked, but he suddenly remembered his previous situation.

“An illusion! This must be my illusion!” Luotian immediately recalled, gazing at the man and woman who looked extremely like Luonantian.

“Tianxin, did you dream again?” Seeing his son’s dazed expression, Chen Badian sighed.

“How to escape? The Huanmo Stone! Yes, finding the Huanmo Stone will restore normalcy!” Luotian recalled Zhou Zhiwen’s words.

“This is too extreme; even I fell for it!” Luotian mused internally, having expected to be unaffected by the illusion while on Buxian Shi. Yet he hadn’t anticipated falling for it.

“You are Chen Tianxin, my son, Chen Badian! A hundred years ago, you were struck by a lightning bolt and have been in a deep sleep ever since! You sleep for ten years, and during that time, your cultivation advances by a small step!”

“Sleeping for ten years, waking for one year, then another lightning strike to send you back into sleep. However, each time you seem to have a dream, imagining yourself as another person. Tell me, who are you this time? What’s your name?” Chen Badian smiled slightly, addressing Luotian.

“But no matter who you are, I am your father! Did you hear that?” Chen Badian shouted with authority, causing Luotian’s body to tremble slightly.

Luotian gazed at Chen Badian’s serious eyes, a hint of doubt stirred within him. Yet recalling his years in the Nine Realms and Celestial Realm, experiencing countless illusions, he naturally adapted.

“Father, where is the Huanmo Stone?” Luotian asked Chen Badian directly.

“The Huanmo Stone, kid, what do you need it for?” Chen Badian’s eyes widened with confusion, gazing at his son.

“The Huanmo Stone is a treasure of the Illusion Sect, always guarded by our sect’s ancestor. If you wish to see it, I’ll beg the ancestor for you. However, since you’ve just awakened, your body is still weak. Also, I heard that each time you sleep, the dreams you have are very real, like being in an illusion. Why do you want to see the Huanmo Stone?” Chen Badian asked, his tone puzzled.

“This… I’m a bit tired; I need to rest!” Luotian spoke softly, his head hurting.

“You old fool! Your son wants to see the Huanmo Stone; you should find a way! You’re the sect’s master!” The woman, resembling Zhang Qiuyue, glared at Chen Badian before turning back with a smile.

“Son, rest well; you’ve just awakened. We know it’s hard for you to accept, but believe soon you’ll adapt!” The woman spoke softly, pulling Chen Badian out of the room.

Luotian didn’t stop them but watched as they exited. As soon as they left, voices echoed outside the room.

“Has Tianxin大哥 (elder) awakened?”

“Ha! I was right; my memory is the best!” As Chen Badian and the woman exited, a figure pushed open the door and entered, smiling.

“Ha! Tianxin大哥, I’ve missed you so much! I calculated the days and knew today would be your awakening. I waited for you specifically! I’ll tell you, during these years of sleep, many things have happened. We can talk for three days and nights!” The man spoke nonstop, his words flowing like a torrent, causing Luotian to tremble.

“Zheng Xin!” Luotian couldn’t help but speak, gazing at the young man who looked extremely similar to Zheng Xin.

“Ha! Zheng Xin, that’s a good name! Tianxin大哥, this is the tenth name you’ve given me. My name is Kuang Fenghua! Whenever I say my name, it’s impossible not to mention my father, Kuang Dezheng! He gave me such a great name!” Kuang Fenghua spoke to Luotian, causing him to be momentarily stunned.

“Is it…?”
“This is truly an illusion!” Luotian gazed at the incessant talking Kuang Fenghua, feeling as if this place were real while his previous experiences in the Nine Realms were dreams.

Chapter 2315: Huanmo Stone ()

Luotian was completely bewildered, unsure which experiences were real. His mind had conjured countless memories, including those of Chen Tianxin’s dreams.

“What is happening?” Luotian felt a headache, gazing at the incessant talking Kuang Fenghua.

“Tianxin, what’s wrong? Don’t worry; this is how you always are. So don’t take it too seriously!” Kuang Fenghua smiled.

“Do you remember when we were ten years old and sneaked to watch Chen Liu Shizi (Master Chen’s disciple) bathe?” Kuang Fenghua returned to his talkative nature, continuously recounting.

“Zheng Xin couldn’t be in the Celestial Realm! That means this Kuang Fenghua is truly another person!” Luotian mused internally. He decided not to dwell on other matters; finding the Huanmo Stone would clarify everything.

“If so, I’ll continue living under Chen Tianxin’s identity here. Even if it is an illusion, it seems there is no immediate danger. As long as I remember my true self and don’t lose myself in desires or become confused, I’ll find a way to regain clarity!” Luotian mused internally, gazing at Kuang Fenghua with a sense of familiarity.

“I’ve missed the people from the Nine Realms for many years!” Luotian mused, if it weren’t an illusion, he would have truly liked to stay here longer.

“Tianxin, you’ve awakened!” As Luotian pondered, someone else entered the room. This time, it was a group of people.

“This….” Luotian gazed at the familiar faces—Diao Dezu, Long Jie, Chen Zhanbiao, Xu Liyi, Jiang Nanxuan, and more—all resembling these people closely. Even their mannerisms and characteristics were almost identical.

“My god…” Luotian felt a headache, truly feeling like he had been dreaming all along, with these people being the dream’s characters.

“Ha! You guys are such useless people; none of you have good memory! Look at me, I was the first to come!” Kuang Fenghua laughed loudly, his eyes filled with pride.

“Don’t talk so much; Tianxin just woke up, and you’re confusing him again!” The young man resembling Diao Dezu mocked.

“Elder Brother…” Two young men resembling Long Jie and Chen Zhanbiao stood beside Luotian, addressing him.

“Let’s go drink!” The group pulled the dazed Luotian out of the room.

The sunlight was blinding, and Luotian gazed at his surroundings with admiration. Green mountains stood tall, grand halls erected around them, and the air was filled with spiritual energy. A group of disciples in green robes looked at Luotian and the others with respect.

“Tianxin Senior has awakened! He’s now at True Immortal Late Stage! I envy you; ten years will advance a small level! Sleeping and waking up, your strength increases significantly. If you keep sleeping for another hundred years, will Tianxin Senior advance to True Immortal Late Stage?” Disciples murmured among themselves.

“….” Luotian felt speechless, watching the disciples. If it were truly like that, this Chen Tianxin would be too extraordinary.

“Huanmo Stone!” Luotian mused on how to obtain it, returning to normal. If he remained in this illusion, his physical body might face danger.

Luotian followed Kuang Fenghua and the others with laughter, seemingly integrating into this world. They gathered until late at night, and Luotian returned to his room the next day.

The following morning, he rose and headed toward Chen Badian’s residence, as the Master of the Illusion Sect would naturally be in the central part of the sect.
