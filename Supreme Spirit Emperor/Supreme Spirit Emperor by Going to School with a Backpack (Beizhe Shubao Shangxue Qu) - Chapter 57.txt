“Boom...” When Luo Tian was at Body Refinement Level Eight, he could already withstand Bone Transformation Initial Stage. Now that he had reached Body Refinement Level Nine, and the opponent was merely a Bone Transformation Initial Stage corpse—comparatively even inferior to a Bone Transformation Initial Stage automaton.

The Cracking Heaven Spear erupted with a thunderous roar, and the golden dragon tore the corpse apart, transforming it into a sky full of crimson mist.

With effortless precision, Luo Tian shattered the corpse. He did not pause, casting a glance toward Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu’s battle. At that moment, the Sky Corpse Sect’s elder was also being driven back in retreat by their combined assaults.

Luo Tian suddenly accelerated, his steps shifting into the Sealing Heaven Step. In an instant, he materialized before the middle-aged man struggling to hold his ground. The Cracking Heaven Spear transformed again into a golden dragon, and with a furious thrust, it lunged toward the man.

Seeing Luo Tian’s sudden burst of power, Zhang Hongyun no longer held back. Two elemental forces surged forth, and a ten-zhang-long aura hand, imbued with withering energy, slammed toward the man. This was Zhang Hongyun’s newly领悟武技—Wood Element, typically imbued with life energy. Yet he had woven the principle of “excess leads to decline” into his technique, where the peak of life was also the beginning of decay.

At that moment, Feng Qianyu erupted as well. A massive Taiji pattern rose beneath the surrounded man, merging water’s gentleness with fire’s ferocity. The opposing forces clashed upon his body.

The middle-aged man had no time to react, still preoccupied with Luo Tian’s Golden Snake Madness. The two techniques struck simultaneously.

The thunderous explosions echoed endlessly, the immense fluctuations toppling nearby buildings. This was the power of a Bone Transformation Mid-Stage elder, leagues stronger than Body Refinement.

As the dust settled, the middle-aged man lay battered on the ground, his face aged decades overnight. His skin withered and gaunt, he exhaled a faint breath through his nose.

“Even this won’t kill him? Not bad for a Bone Transformation Mid-Stage elder,” Zhang Hongyun mused.

Luo Tian and the others nodded. A Bone Transformation Initial Stage opponent, struck by three overwhelming attacks, would have been instantly annihilated. Luo Tian’s Golden Snake Madness was manageable, but Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu’s techniques were monstrous—so much so that even Luo Tian felt a shiver of unease.

“Buzz…” The Cracking Heaven Spear, brimming with destructive power, pierced the man’s throat. A Bone Transformation Mid-Stage elder was a senior sect leader, yet now he lay slain by three attackers.

Meanwhile, another middle-aged man from the Sky Corpse Sect, locked in combat with Baihu, sensed his companion’s death. His face twisted with grief. The two had fought together for years, as close as brothers. Though the Sky Corpse Sect rarely harbored emotions, they were an exception—those who knew them understood their bond was one of mutual sacrifice.

“Ha!” The middle-aged man laughed wildly, ignoring Baihu’s tail sweeping across his body. His face contorted with ferocity as he stared at the three.

“You three killed him! Today, you’ll all die with him!” The man was swept away by Baihu’s strike but rose again, roaring at Luo Tian. In his hand was a crimson pearl.

“You sons of bitches from the Sky Corpse Sect should all die!” Feng Qianyu roared, his aura surging toward the man. But Luo Tian intercepted him in a fit of rage.

“Luo Tian!” Feng Qianyu turned, eyes blazing.

“Danger!” Luo Tian’s gaze was grave as he locked onto the middle-aged man clutching the Soul-Refining Pearl. He had heard of it before while seeking vengeance against Feiyun, but never seen it firsthand. Now, witnessing its malevolent aura, he could not afford to be careless.

“This Soul-Refining Pearl was meant for the sect, but since my second brother is dead… what’s the point of living? I’ll take you all with me!” The middle-aged man’s face twisted with resolve, gazing at his fallen comrade.

“Spit!” He hurled a mouthful of blood onto the pearl, his face contorted with madness. Then he slammed his palm against his chest.

“One… two…” He struck over a dozen times before stopping. Each strike sent another gush of blood onto the pearl, including his Bone Transformation Mid-Stage essence.

The Soul-Refining Pearl devoured the blood like a child who never knew satiety. After consuming the man’s essence, it descended upon the corpse slain by Luo Tian’s trio, absorbing blood through its wounds.

Within a breath, it landed on the last remaining Bone Transformation Mid-Stage elder.

“You won’t die! You’ll live in agony!” The man roared, slapping the pearl with all his might.

“Crack…” A glass-shattering sound echoed as the pearl shattered under his furious strike. The event lasted less than two breaths.

As the pearl burst, a sky of blood mist spilled forth, engulfing the town in crimson. From afar, it appeared as a sea of blood, obscuring all details.

Chapter 278: Sky Corpse Sect’s Assault ()

Chapter 278: Sky Corpse Sect’s Assault

The sound of surprise made Luo Tian and the others’ gazes sharpen, their faces etched with shock.

Above, a black-cloaked elder bore an intense joy, his body trailing two crimson aura wings that trembled slightly.

“Soul-Refining Stage!” Luo Tian and the others murmured, their gazes cautious as they watched the elder.

“Luo Tian, come with me willingly. You can’t resist my grip!” The elder’s face held a mocking tone as he extended an aura hand to seize Luo Tian.

“Want to touch him? Prove you have the strength!” Zhang Ziping’s voice echoed as he materialized from afar, striking the crimson aura hand with a punch that shattered it.

“Ah, so you’re Zhang Ziping? Good—capture you both!” The black-cloaked elder observed Zhang Ziping’s arrival without much concern. After all, the Sky Corpse Sect had already dispatched many elders, and he himself was at Bone Transformation Late Stage. He could not care less about Zhang Ziping’s Soul-Refining Early Stage.

“Senior Brother, you came just in time!” Luo Tian sighed, knowing the battle ahead was beyond their interference.

A rustling of wind filled the air as numerous black silhouettes appeared in Luo Tian’s vision. Body Refinement, Bone Transformation—most striking was the black-cloaked figures above, their pressure radiating ominously. They were clearly Soul-Refining Stage elders.

Luo Tian’s face darkened slightly as he saw the approaching Sky Corpse Sect forces, sighing. Today would be a bloodbath—Soul-Refining Stage elders might even fall.

“Senior Grandmaster!” Five Soul-Refining Stage black-cloaked figures flew toward the first elder, their faces respectful.

The Sky Corpse Sect’s main force arrived in unison, their uniforms marked by a crescent moon emblem on the collars.

“With such strength, without deploying Ritual Soul Stage elders, this sect rivals any faction in the Northern Domain!” Zhang Hongyun mused.

“Unexpected! Zhang Ziping, to capture this one Five Elements Body Luo Tian, we’ve mobilized such strength!” The elder’s face bore a triumphant grin as he eyed Luo Tian with insatiable greed.

“Is he coveting something of mine?” Luo Tian pondered silently.

“Indeed unexpected! You Sky Corpse Sect have grown so powerful in the Northern Domain!” A calm voice echoed, accompanied by a chilling killing intent from afar.

“Wei Mingxuan?” The black-cloaked elder’s face darkened as five colorful figures appeared before them.

“Roar…” Three earth-shaking dragon roars stunned the ears of all present. A colossal dragon soared from afar, its body obscuring the sky as it carried a horde of Five Elements Sect disciples.

“You?” The black-cloaked elder’s face twisted in disbelief. He hadn’t expected the Five Elements Sect to mobilize so swiftly, arriving mere moments after them.

“Did you think we didn’t know your Sky Corpse Sect’s intent to capture Luo Tian? How could we let this child go out alone, accompanied only by two Bone Transformation Initial Stage disciples?” Wei Mingxuan’s tone carried a faint mockery.

“Had you not been as elusive as rats, we wouldn’t have resorted to this plan!”

Wei Mingxuan ignored the elder’s expression, continuing.

“Indeed a setup by you all! But do you think your Five Elements Sect废物 could stop us?” The black-cloaked elder sneered.

“Ha! Add our Thunder Sect!”
“And the Hundred Forge Sect!”
“And me, the Soul-Refining Sect, Feiyun Sect, Shadow Flow Sect, and Wild Blade Sect!” More figures appeared in the sky, with over a dozen Soul-Refining Stage elders. Ground forces also arrived, their roars shaking the heavens.

Luo Tian observed the shifting figures in sky and ground, his face awed. He could confirm these forces had gathered every faction in the Northern Domain. His mind marveled at how the Sky Corpse Sect had become such a toxic thorn.

Among the crowd, he spotted familiar faces—Ying Hongtu, Rong Da, Bai Zhantian, even Wang Tianxiang. A smile tugged at his lips; he hadn’t expected to fight alongside them again.

“Uncle!” Wang Tianxiang approached Luo Tian, shouting as he had ascended to Bone Transformation Stage.

Numerous sects’ Body Refinement Stage disciples gazed at the standing figures with reverence. Witnessing so many prodigies together was a rare sight in centuries.

All eyes turned to the surrounded Luo Tian, puzzled why so many Bone Transformation Stage elders stood around a Body Refinement Level Nine.

Luo Tian gazed at the sky, knowing the main battle would be among the Soul-Refining Stage elders. The Sky Corpse Sect had only seven or eight such forces, while the Northern Domain’s side boasted over twenty. Moreover, several top sects’ masters were at Soul-Refining Late Stage—two sides were vastly mismatched.

“Many people indeed! Do you think we’ve already won?” The black-cloaked elder paused briefly before recovering, his face laced with contempt.

“Whether we’ve won or not is uncertain, but at least we’ll make you waste time!” Wei Mingxuan’s tone carried a hint of doubt as he chuckled.

“Then it’s not certain,” the black-cloaked elder replied coldly, his gaze sweeping over the Soul-Refining Stage elders in the sky.

“Kill!” The elder’s voice was cold, yet he did not move.

“Screams…” A chorus of cries echoed from sky and ground, laced with disbelief.

Chapter 279: Chaos ()

Chapter 279: Chaos

The black-cloaked elder’s voice had barely faded when Wei Mingxuan felt a gust of wind before him—a yellowish hand striking his chest.

His lips curled into a sneer as he met the attack with a punch, shattering it.

“Huang Jingshan! Finally emerged?” Wei Mingxuan’s face bore anger as he barked.

As the attack was thwarted, the Five Elements Sect’s peak masters realized who had attacked Wei Mingxuan—this happened in an instant.

Huang Jingshan’s face bore disbelief; he hadn’t expected Wei Mingxuan to have already seen through him.

“Soul-Refining Mid-Stage—your time in the Five Elements Sect was not wasted. You’ve even reached Soul-Refining Mid-Stage!”

Wei Mingxuan’s face carried disdain as he spoke.

“How did you know?” Huang Jingshan asked, his voice low. He believed himself hidden well in the Five Elements Sect but hadn’t expected Wei Mingxuan to know his identity.

“Do you think your concealment was good? It was, but you forgot the elders’ habit of periodically scanning the sect with their spiritual senses!” Wei Mingxuan’s tone was calm as he explained, now that the truth had been revealed.

Huang Jingshan’s body trembled at Wei Mingxuan’s words, his mind swirling with confusion.

“Why did we let you live this long? Simply to observe the purpose of that Yang surname boy’s arrival in the Northern Domain. I was right—his goal must be the aura rain event two years ago in Dahan Forest, wasn’t it?” Wei Mingxuan ignored Huang Jingshan’s darkening face, his gaze filled with contempt.

While they spoke, other sects were also attacked—unlike Wei Mingxuan, who had been warned beforehand. They could only helplessly watch as traitors among them struck.

“Senior Grandmaster!” The Thunder Sect’s master stared at the elder who had attacked him, disbelief etched on his face. He hadn’t expected a lifelong companion to be a Sky Corpse Sect spy.

This scene unfolded across multiple sects, causing chaos. Not only did Soul-Refining Stage elders face betrayal, but even disciples below were caught in uprisings. The Five Elements Sect’s Thick Earth Peak was the worst—over three-quarters of its disciples rebelled, killing their comrades with blades or punches before they could comprehend.

The Sky Corpse Sect elders watched the chaos, a smile on their faces as they called out: “How many chances do you think you have now?”

Nearly ten Soul-Refining Stage figures appeared behind the black-cloaked elder—those who had attacked earlier. Their expressions were emotionless as they withdrew, balancing the numbers between both sides. Though the sects had a slight edge, the Sky Corpse Sect’s forces were still formidable.

Though numbers were equal, several top sects’ masters were at Soul-Refining Late Stage. Plus, the presence of a few dragons added to their strength—none could match the Sky Corpse Sect.

Yet, ten Soul-Refining Stage forces were no easy task. Their faces darkened as they faced the opposing ten, some of whom were their sect’s pillars or former comrades. Now, these people had betrayed them.

The Northern Domain sects’ side erupted into chaos as disciples clashed, but Luo Tian’s group of twenty remained orderly. They were core disciples from various sects and would never betray their masters.

Only Yang Huanyu moved forward, killing several opponents before approaching the Sky Corpse Sect’s black-cloaked figures.

Seeing Yang Huanyu, the Sky Corpse Sect elders all knelt in reverence—regardless of their cultivation. Even Soul-Refining Stage figures gazed at the gray-cloaked figure standing proudly.

Luo Tian’s gaze swept over Yang Huanyu, a faint smile on his face. He had long suspected Yang Huanyu’s identity. When Yang Huanyu reached Bone Transformation Stage, Luo Tian had felt a strange alertness—this youth bore the same aura as the three black-cloaked men he had met in Xuantian City’s teahouse. Plus, his Chronological Book reacted strongly.

Yang Huanyu glanced at Luo Tian; they were a hundred zhang apart, yet their gazes met. Both felt an odd sense of enmity—rivals.

Luo Tian had never underestimated Yang Huanyu’s strength or seen him fight, so he remained mysterious. Now, seeing the over ten thousand Sky Corpse Sect elders bowing to him, Luo Tian’s curiosity deepened. What was Yang Huanyu’s identity? Even the Sky Corpse Sect’s Grandmaster’s son couldn’t command such reverence.

Chaos lasted only a while. After all, the traitors were few compared to the tens of thousands from the Northern Domain sects. It was but a drop in the ocean.

“Kill!” The Sky Corpse Sect’s elders waved their hands, each summoning a figure with Soul-Refining Stage aura.

“Are these Soul-Refining Stage corpses? Unexpectedly, the Sky Corpse Sect can cultivate such beings!” Zhang Ziping’s face bore concern but he ignored it, his gaze fixed on Huang Jingshan.

“Zhang Ziping! I’ve told you—someday, you’ll kneel at my feet and beg for mercy! I’ve waited long enough. Today is your death!” Huang Jingshan wasted no words, his Soul-Refining Mid-Stage power surging as he rushed toward Zhang Ziping.

Chapter 280: Reencountering Li Xiuping ()

Chapter 280: Reencountering Li Xiuping

Seeing Huang Jingshan charge toward him, Zhang Ziping smiled. Though Huang Jingshan was Soul-Refining Mid-Stage, he had never feared him. His three-element wings fluttered, and he shot forward like an arrow toward Huang Jingshan.

“Ha! Wei Xuanming, let me test how strong your Five Elements Sect Grandmaster truly is!” The Sky Corpse Sect’s leader sneered, his soul-reflecting corpse accompanying him as it attacked Wei Xuanming.

“Die!” Wei Xuanming roared, his Bone Transformation Late Stage power surging as he attacked the leader.

The Sky Corpse Sect’s forces glared coldly, choosing their opponents as red aura surged forth toward the Northern Domain.

“Sky Corpse Sect bastards! You all deserve death!” The Thunder Sect’s master roared, swinging his sword toward the approaching Sky Corpse Sect elder.

“Long time since I fought! Today, let’s stretch!” The Hundred Forge Sect’s master displayed his muscular frame as he charged toward the black-cloaked Sky Corpse Sect elder.

The Water Source Temple’s abbot bore a killing intent, his staff moving like the void itself as he appeared before a Sky Corpse Sect elder.

All Soul-Refining Stage elders maintained distance from the battlefield, as their clashes could harm Body Refinement disciples.

“Little Brother, stay here and don’t move. I’ll see who can harm you today!” Lei Yong’s body crackled with lightning, his Bone Transformation Late Stage power radiating.

“Who dares touch you! Who dies!” Ji Chen’s eyes flashed coldly as he roared.

Hearing their words, Luo Tian felt a warmth but soon sighed. In such chaos, who could help whom? He knew that if anyone was caught in the crossfire, no one would care. Fortunately, the Northern Domain’s advantage in Bone Transformation Stage was more than double that of the Sky Corpse Sect.

“Kill!” Ying Hongtu struck first, his body emitting thunderous roars as he charged into the chaos with bloodshot eyes.

“Luo Tian, if I don’t die today, I’ll treat you to a drink. You were the one I most admired!” Rong Da’s eyes flashed with coldness as he entered the battle.

“If you truly reach Bone Transformation Stage, I’ll challenge you!” Pei Letian laughed as he rushed into the crowd.

“Kid, remember—your debt of a challenge remains! I’ll prove his judgment was sometimes wrong!” Ji Yunhai laughed, blue light surging as he entered the fray.

“Luo Tian! We’re going too!” Zhang Hongyun’s face bore a reluctant smile as he entered the chaos.

One by one, figures bid Luo Tian farewell, entering the battle. Each addition strengthened the Five Elements Sect’s side.

Luo Tian watched familiar faces enter the crowd, smiling. He knew after this battle, relations between sects would ease.

Yet he found it strange that the Water Source Temple’s abbot had arrived but no sign of Chen Changsheng or Tu Yu Zheng.

Though he remained still, his gaze never left Yang Huanyu. But when he noticed a black-cloaked figure beside Yang Huanyu, his eyes filled with blood. His fists clenched tightly as he whispered a name—
A name he would remember for life, one that had changed his fate: Li Xiuping.

“Hm?” Hearing Luo Tian utter Li Xiuping’s name, Lei Yong and Ji Chen’s faces shifted slightly. They knew Luo Tian’s resolve to kill Li Xiuping was absolute.

“Seems he has a grudge against you, doesn’t he? Why not greet your old friend?” Yang Huanyu’s voice was calm as he addressed Li Xiuping beside him.

“I’ll go greet him then. I’ve heard he’s stuck in Bone Transformation Stage—whether it’s true or not?” Li Xiuping muttered, watching Luo Tian charge at him like a madman. His face bore amusement.

Lei Yong and Ji Chen feared Luo Tian’s safety, following him into the crowd.

Behind them, an unassuming figure with a softly humming short knife trailed after them.

“Dong Sansi?” Lei Yong and Ji Chen were surprised, watching the figure behind them.

To their shock, Dong Sansi’s aura now radiated Bone Transformation Stage Early—though unstable, it was unmistakably Bone Transformation.

“I’ve finally been able to help you!” Dong Sansi’s face bore determination as his nameless blade became a weapon of strength, trailing behind the three.

These four men, with Luo Tian at their head, pierced into the Sky Corpse Sect’s forces like a nail.

Around them, Ying Hongtu and Bai Zhantian bore confusion—why was Luo Tian so desperate? They too converged toward him, knowing the Sky Corpse Sect’s primary target was Luo Tian. If he were captured, the Sky Corpse Sect would scatter. But the crowd was too dense—tens of thousands clashing in a battle between cultivators.

The town was reduced to rubble during the conflict, its ground scraped three feet deep.

Blood flowed endlessly; bodies fell constantly. Luo Tian pushed forward, his eyes only on Li Xiuping. Anyone blocking him was slain by a single strike or pushed back. When facing Bone Transformation Mid- to Late Stage opponents, Lei Yong and Ji Chen took over, repelling them.

Li Xiuping moved like a ghost toward Luo Tian, his body now radiating crimson blood aura—unlike others, his was more vivid.

“One breath… two breaths…” As time passed, the distance between Luo Tian and Li Xiuping narrowed. Luo Tian’s group grew stronger.

“Luo Tian!” Li Xiuping saw his figure and smiled.

At that moment, Ying Hongtu and Bai Zhantian joined Luo Tian, their combined strength killing Sky Corpse Sect disciples at every step. Even Bone Transformation Late Stage opponents were slain by them.

Too strong! The Sky Corpse Sect’s forces, though cold-blooded, were shaken by Luo Tian’s twenty-something men. Their surrounding space was cleared of anyone daring to approach them.

After an hour of battle, Luo Tian and Li Xiuping finally met.

Seeing Li Xiuping, Luo Tian’s eyes turned blood-red. His wounds from the battle felt no pain as he roared, his blood-stained Cracking Heaven Spear sweeping toward Li Xiuping.

Chapter 281: Reencountering Li Xiuping ()

Chapter 281: Reencountering Li Xiuping

Luo Tian’s approach, like a reaper, made the surrounding crowd hesitate to attack. They expanded his space cautiously, watching for any sudden attacks on Luo Tian.

Seeing Luo Tian charge toward him, Li Xiuping sneered: “You, at Body Refinement Level Nine—how dare you challenge me?”

The thunderous clash of power echoed as Li Xiuping struck down the Cracking Heaven Spear, his gaze filled with contempt.

“Is this enough?” Luo Tian’s face twisted in ferocity, his Dragon Emperor Reverse Scales appearing in hand. He placed it on his forearm’s Nirvana Dragon Seal without hesitation.

“Roar…” A golden light illuminated the battlefield, revealing the Dragon Baby’s figure.

“Big Brother…” The Dragon Baby wore a red diaper, his face showing fear as he saw the sea of people. He ran toward Luo Tian.

“Dragon Baby, be brave. Go play with those two brothers and the cat. Protect them!” Luo Tian handed him a pill, pointing to Lei Yong and Ji Chen.

“I’m scared!” The Dragon Baby clung to Luo Tian’s pants, staring at Lei Yong and Ji Chen—bloodied and fierce. Not only them, but everyone around was drenched in blood. This was the Dragon Baby’s first time seeing such a bloody scene.

“Roar…” A tiger’s roar echoed, forcing Luo Tian to release Baihu. He knew only Baihu could calm the Dragon Baby.

Seeing the Dragon Baby’s fear, even Ying Hongtu and Bai Zhantian felt a pang of amusement. They had witnessed the Dragon Baby’s terrifying power—his ability to toy with Bone Transformation Mid-Stage automata. They believed even a Bone Transformation Late Stage opponent would be helpless against him. Yet this boy’s face showed fear.

Baihu appeared, and the Dragon Baby seemed to find home, leaping onto Baihu’s back. His small body lay there.

The newly appeared Baihu blinked in confusion, his eyes narrowing as a mountainous weight fell on his back. He nearly collapsed.

Then he heard the voice he never wanted to hear: “Little Cat, protect me!”

Understanding who was on his back, Baihu glared at Luo Tian. He left a deep footprint beneath him before moving slightly away from Luo Tian and Li Xiuping, knowing this was a duel. Otherwise, Luo Tian wouldn’t have released the Dragon Baby.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s aura surged like a flood, climbing rapidly within three breaths to Bone Transformation Mid-Stage.

“Is this enough?” Luo Tian’s gaze held contempt as he stared at Li Xiuping.

Li Xiuping’s face bore shock, his eyes filled with awe as he stared at Luo Tian. He hadn’t expected him to reach Bone Transformation Mid-Stage.

Not only Li Xiuping, but Yang Huanyu behind the Sky Corpse Sect also shifted slightly. His fists clenched and unclenched before relaxing. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to reach Bone Transformation Mid-Stage.

“This must be the Dragon Emperor’s Reverse Scales. I never thought this Luo Tian would have such luck, linking with the Dragon Emperor in Dahan Forest!” Yang Huanyu’s gaze on Luo Tian grew firmer.

“Deeply hidden…”
Li Xiuping’s shock faded, but he showed no fear. His crimson aura thickened.

“Kill!” Luo Tian had nothing to say about Li Xiuping. His killing intent reached its peak, and Bone Transformation Mid-Stage power surged forth. He took a step with the Sealing Heaven Step, appearing before Li Xiuping in an instant. His fist struck fiercely, carrying all his resolve—no chance for Li Xiuping to escape.

Bone Transformation Mid-Stage Luo Tian was formidable, his physical strength and aura power leagues ahead of ordinary cultivators. His punch equaled a High-Grade Martial Art.

The Sealing Heaven Step rushed forward, and Li Xiuping had no time to react. He was struck directly, his body emitting a crackling sound as he flew backward.

A mouthful of blood spewed from his lips, Li Xiuping’s eyes filled with intense fear. He marveled at Luo Tian’s strength but suddenly transformed into a blood mist, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“I can defeat you once; I can defeat you twice, thrice! You are nothing to me now!” Luo Tian sneered, his frail body surging with power again. He rushed toward Li Xiuping.

The thunderous explosions echoed endlessly around them, drowning out the surrounding chaos.

Those near their battlefield hesitated to fight, watching the clash.

The Feiyun Sect’s disciples watched Li Xiuping battling Luo Tian, their faces filled with complex emotions. They couldn’t believe this was the once-revered Li Xiuping.

Luo Tian fought with increasing vigor, but his heart was anxious—his time was only one breath. Though it wasn’t long, he knew Li Xiuping had hidden cards.

“End this quickly!” Luo Tian resolved, today he would end Li Xiuping—no chance of him escaping.

“Cracking Heaven Spear!” The spear appeared in his hand, and the Five Elements’ Mutual Generation technique—Golden Snake Madness—was unleashed.

At Bone Transformation Mid-Stage, the Golden Snake Madness was leagues stronger than when he was at Body Refinement Level Nine. Five golden dragons converged, forming a resplendent dragon that roared, lifting dust and rushing toward Li Xiuping. The crowd could see the scales on its body and the terrifying aura of destruction it carried.

Li Xiuping dared not underestimate Luo Tian, his body radiating crimson blood aura. He had switched to a crimson sword, its entire blade glowing red with countless runes.

“Is that the Blood Demon Sword? How did Li Xiuping obtain it?” A Sky Corpse Sect elder beside Yang Huanyu was stunned.

Seeing Li Xiuping brandish the Blood Demon Sword, Yang Huanyu was also surprised but soon smiled. “This is more interesting! Otherwise, Li Xiuping would have been a waste of my resources!”

Yang Huanyu’s words had barely finished when Li Xiuping raised his crimson sword. A wave of blood scent filled the air.

Chapter 282: Blood Transformation Art ()

Chapter 282: Blood Transformation Art

Lei Yong and Ji Chen felt the overwhelming blood scent, their faces grim. The battlefield’s blood scent was already thick, but they hadn’t expected Li Xiuping’s crimson sword to match it.

In an instant, Li Xiuping’s lips curled like a devil from hell. His crimson sword slashed downward toward the golden dragon.

The blood-red blade, like a crescent moon, cut through the golden dragon’s body.

“This is the Heavenly Slaughter Blood Demon Cut! The legendary technique of the Sky Corpse Sect’s Blood Demon Elder. Has Li Xiuping inherited his legacy?” A Sky Corpse Sect elder beside Yang Huanyu marveled.

“Yes, he has inherited the Blood Demon Elder’s legacy!” Yang Huanyu smiled, explaining.

“Senior Master, this Blood Demon Legacy was prepared for you by the Sect Leader. Why did you give it to him?” The elder’s face bore disbelief as he stared at Yang Huanyu.

The Blood Demon Elder, a sect elder from three thousand years ago, reached Ritual Soul Peak but never entered the Soul Stage. He died in regret. His legacy was meant for Yang Huanyu, but the elder hadn’t expected it to be given to Li Xiuping.
