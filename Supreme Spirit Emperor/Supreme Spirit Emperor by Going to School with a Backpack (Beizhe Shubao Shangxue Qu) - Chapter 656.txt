"Ten Thousand Seals!" From the deepest peaks of one hundred and eight mountains, a solemn voice echoed. Golden divine script chains seemed embedded within the fissures, as if attempting to stitch together the heavens.

"The heavens are collapsing..." Long Que murmured softly before suddenly awakening, his mind more puzzled than ever, bewildered by why he had spoken such words.

One hundred and eight individuals bore solemn expressions, their hands moving in unison as divine scripts burst forth with overwhelming power. One hundred and eight divine script chains formed a vast net, sealing the heavens. Luo Tian's face bore awe as he gazed upon the shattered sky, a strange sensation stirring within him. His hands began to weave endlessly.

At that moment, no one paid attention to Luo Tian; all focus was on the fissures in the heavens.

After another hour, the thunderous roar that had shaken heaven and earth gradually fell silent. The fissures faded away, leaving one hundred and eight people, including Gu Tian Shu, pale as they gazed at the heavens.

"It's becoming increasingly unstable!" An elder spoke, his voice heavy with concern.

"Indeed, it's been frequent lately. How long has it been?" Others spoke in unison, their expressions grave.

"There's nothing we can do. The worst outcome would be..." One person began, but trailed off without finishing.

"Buzz..." As people discussed, a tremor of immense power rose from one mountain peak.

A black divine light flickered, drawing everyone's attention to Luo Tian seated in meditation.

"How is this possible?" Their eyes widened with disbelief upon sensing Luo Tian's aura.

"Respected elder, please assist me in testing the technique I've deduced!" Luo Tian opened his eyes slowly, gazing at the grotesque elder before him.

"Very well. Let me see your progress!" The elder nodded, unafraid of Luo Tian's attack.

Before the elder could finish speaking, Luo Tian vanished in a blur, appearing before the elder in an instant and launching a punch.

The thunderous impact echoed. A simple punch, devoid of the chaotic flurry, yet its power surpassed Luo Tian's previous punches by several times.

"This..." The elder's face shifted slightly, his hand reaching out to grasp Luo Tian's punch.

"Boom..." A dull sound echoed. The elder took a step back, dust swirling as the scene froze. The elder's hand had caught Luo Tian's fist.

"Ah..." A gasp of astonishment spread across the peaks. People's faces bore shock as they watched Luo Tian retract his fist.

"How is this possible? That elder is at the late stage of Immortal King. How can a novice at the middle stage of Immortal King shake him?" People exclaimed in disbelief.

"What is this technique called?" The elder's gaze turned to Luo Tian, drawing everyone's attention.

They recalled, realizing that Luo Tian's ability to shake an elder at the late stage of Immortal King must stem from his newly领悟 technique.

"This technique is 'Ten Thousand Domains Supreme!'" Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice carrying an aura of dominance.

Chapter 2460: Return to the Immortal Realm

Luo Tian stood there, his expression filled with joy as the black demonic patterns gradually vanished from his body.

"Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!" Gu Tian Shu laughed heartily, uttering three "excellent" words. His eyes held satisfaction as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"This kid's talent is unparalleled. In half a year, he's mastered his own technique—far faster than us!" People smiled.

"Grand Elder, what was that earlier?" Luo Tian asked, recalling the terrifying scene.

"That's why we can't leave here. If no one guards this place, terrible changes will occur!"

"We don't know what it is, but we do know these one hundred and eight peaks form a great array. Only by activating the array can we seal that energy. We don't know when it might burst forth!"

"If it breaks through the seal, it will bring catastrophic destruction to the Immortal Realm. As for what's sealed, no one knows!"

"You can tell that so-called immortal to kill you. We'll unseal Gu Tian Court's seal, causing chaos in the Immortal Realm. No one will be safe!" The grotesque elder spoke.

"Indeed," Luo Tian nodded lightly, his gaze respectful toward the group.

"There's still a month left. There's enough time!" Gu Tian Shu looked at Luo Tian.

"You have another question: are you certain you'll use this sword forever?" Gu Tian Shu addressed Luo Tian.

"Actually, I still prefer the Rupture Heaven Spear. However, its rank is too low now," Luo Tian sighed deeply, for the Rupture Heaven Spear had accompanied him for so long.

"I'll help you refine it!" A strong individual spoke, revealing a golden tooth that stood out prominently.

"Master Jin's forging skills are still good. Go ahead!" Gu Tian Shu addressed Luo Tian.

"Thank you, Master!" Luo Tian extended his hand, retrieving the Rupture Heaven Spear. He gently caressed its shaft before tossing it toward the elder with golden teeth.

"Buzz..." A black light appeared in the elder's hand. Upon touching it, the spear trembled violently.

"Good spear!" The elder with golden teeth smiled, his hand pressing down. The Rupture Heaven Spear ceased trembling.

"Wait... three or five days!" The elder with golden teeth took the spear and entered a stone chamber.

"Thank you, Master!" Luo Tian's eyes showed gratitude. He secretly marveled at the talents within Gu Tian Court. The elder who had previously adjusted his medicinal elixir clearly possessed unique abilities.

"Your weapon issue is resolved. Since you've decided to use the spear, try to use it less," Gu Tian Shu advised Luo Tian.

"I'll try my best!" Luo Tian's face showed a bitter smile.

"The time is too short. Otherwise, you could have waited until the late stage of Immortal King before leaving. That would give you a greater chance," Gu Tian Shu sighed deeply.

"Don't worry, Grand Elder. I'll be fine!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his heart already indifferent to life and death.

"Go to the First Peak. Try to enhance your strength further. Then you can leave!" Gu Tian Shu spoke softly.

"Understood," Luo Tian nodded, descending from the peak where Gu Tian Shu resided. He traversed through peaks toward the deepest ones.

The grand mountains exuded an ancient aura. Luo Tian ascended to the summit, where he saw a seated elder. The elder possessed an immortal aura and bore a smile—Yuan Tiansheng, one of the peak-stage Immortal Kings.

"Respectful greeting to Elder Yuan!" Luo Tian knew the elder's name but had never visited Yuan Tiansheng's peak. Enhancing his strength had always been done by others.

"Display your domain!" Yuan Tiansheng spoke, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Howl..." Upon hearing Yuan Tiansheng's words, Luo Tian didn't refuse. A roar erupted from his body, spreading a gray domain covering five thousand zhang.

The elder's eyes narrowed slightly, satisfaction in his gaze. "You haven't fallen behind!"

"That saved us a lot of trouble!" Yuan Tiansheng chuckled, standing up slowly. He led Luo Tian toward a dilapidated building.

"Those who can come here are mostly people not recognized by the Dao. Because their domains are all self-created," Yuan Tiansheng spoke.

"Ah, I see!" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed sharply. He suddenly recalled that Gu Tian Shu's name hadn't appeared on the King's Monument.

"Domains. I have a method left by the Heavenly Court to make your domain even stronger," Yuan Tiansheng said.

"The method is simple. With your insight, you can learn it in three or five days," Yuan Tiansheng said. He entered the dilapidated building.

"Here, when you display your domain, you'll feel pressure. Then through special methods, refine your domain."

"When your domain is refined to four thousand zhang, come out!" Yuan Tiansheng smiled, exiting the empty hall.

"Displaying a domain can refine it?" Luo Tian stood there. The Reincarnation Domain slowly opened.

"Buzz..." Almost instantly, the hall trembled with waves of power. Supreme pressure descended upon it.

Divine lights also rose around the old hall, with hand seals appearing in Luo Tian's vision.

"Howl..." A roar echoed. Numerous soul faces howled desperately, emitting a painful aura.

"This is the aura of an Emperor. Could this be the domain of an Immortal Emperor?" Luo Tian was instantly shocked, feeling his domain crack with a crunching sound.

"Boom..." After a while, Luo Tian could no longer endure. His domain shattered violently, scattering as wind through the hall.

"Again!" Luo Tian barked, opening his Reincarnation Domain again. His hands moved, evoking the hand seals on the walls. Waves of power radiated from his body, merging with the Reincarnation Domain to withstand the ancient pressure.

An hour later, the domain shattered again. Luo Tian's face showed a slight smile.

"It's really simple!" Luo Tian muttered, opening his domain again and evoking the hand seals on the walls.

One hour... one day...

Time flowed slowly. Three days passed, and Luo Tian's domain finally compressed to four thousand zhang as Yuan Tiansheng had instructed. Though it was four thousand zhang, Luo Tian could sense its strength—definitely surpassing that of an Immortal King at the middle stage.

"Truly, I must leave!" Luo Tian murmured, exiting the hall to find Yuan Tiansheng smiling.

"What if I can't fight?" Luo Tian gazed at Yuan Tiansheng, secretly pondering the strength of the immortal emperor. Luo Tian could roughly assess it.

"Go..." Yuan Tiansheng smiled, standing outside the hall as he addressed Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian just stepped out of the hall, his back's Long Yuan Sword emitted a radiant light.

Black light flowed. A dark spear sliced through the heavens, instantly appearing before Luo Tian's body.

"Buzz..." Long Yuan flew out of its crimson sheath, two black lights colliding before Luo Tian. Crack...

Thunder rose before Luo Tian. His brows furrowed slightly. He extended his hand, grasping Long Yuan with one hand and the black Rupture Heaven Spear with the other.

Long Yuan returned to its sheath. Luo Tian's eyes held joy, gazing at the refined Rupture Heaven Spear. Even after colliding with Long Yuan, it bore no traces.

"An极品仙器!" Luo Tian gently caressed the spear's shaft, muttering. He could sense the Rupture Heaven Spear's aura was nearly equal to Long Yuan.

"There's also an issue with the characters on your back," Yuan Tiansheng gazed at the "Gui Gu" (Ghost Valley) on Luo Tian's back. He waved his hand, and the mountain beneath them trembled again. A golden divine script flew from Yuan Tiansheng's hand, imprinting itself on Luo Tian's back.

The script imprinted. The "Gui Gu" characters gradually dimmed, causing Luo Tian's eyes to widen in shock. These two characters had troubled him for a long time. If not for them, Luo Tian wouldn't have ended up in such a situation.

"It can only be sealed for three months. After that, it will appear again," Yuan Tiansheng addressed Luo Tian, causing Luo Tian to tug at his lips.

"Three months is enough!" Luo Tian muttered in his heart. After he left, he would immediately head to Eternal Life Mountain. Thus, it was sufficient.

"Little one, take these treasures and elixirs..." Strong individuals on each peak spoke, giving Luo Tian many treasures. They still hoped Luo Tian would return. The more people there were, the more secure the Ten Thousand Seals array became. Previously, they had fewer people; if not for Gu Tian Shu's arrival, the seal might have already broken.

"Thank you all!" Luo Tian bowed. During this time, although painful, he had improved significantly and learned much. These people were all extraordinary individuals with expertise in various fields.

"Go!" Gu Tian Shu spoke softly. Luo Tian stepped onto an altar, the place where the transmission array to the Immortal Realm was located. Divine scripts flowed; Luo Tian's figure vanished from people's sight, leaving the place once again in tranquility.

"This kid has left. I actually feel a bit reluctant. Now, it'll be boring again!" The God of Ferocity's face bore a wistful expression. They could only move within their own peaks and couldn't act freely.

"Hope this kid remains safe!" People's faces bore smiles. Buzz...

...As people discussed, the heavens changed. A figure appeared in the sky, causing people's faces to pause slightly.

"What's going on? Another person has entered the Trial Ground?" People were stunned, gazing at the scene in the sky with disbelief.

White robes, holding a green lightning sword. He gave off an icy feeling, his body radiating coldness—Luo Tian's elder brother Zhang Ziping.

Chapter 2461: Journey to Eternal Life Mountain

"Zhang Ziping..." Gu Tian Shu's brows slightly lifted. He naturally recognized Zhang Ziping. He hadn't expected Zhang Ziping to end up here like Luo Tian.

"Another from the Nine Domains?" Upon hearing Gu Tian Shu's words, people around were surprised.

"Hope he succeeds. If he does, one of us might also be able to leave!" People immediately regained their interest, watching Zhang Ziping's trial in the scene.

...Luo Tian didn't know what had happened after leaving Gu Tian Court. In a thunderous roar, the scenery around him changed. A vast expanse of stars appeared in his vision, rapidly flowing.

The heavens tore open. Next moment, Luo Tian saw the earth, his body smoothly appearing on the heavens.

"Finally, a relatively smooth transmission!" Luo Tian muttered in his heart, gazing at the vast heavens. Mountains and rivers appeared in his vision.

"Upper Three Realms!" Luo Tian muttered softly, instantly sensing he wasn't in the Immortal Mountain but in the Upper Three Realms.

"People must not have expected me to return," Luo Tian's eyes showed a slight smile. His figure darted, heading toward Eternal Life Mountain.

Without the "Gui Gu" characters, Luo Tian's movements were much easier. His middle stage of Immortal King made it hard for anyone to detect his presence, as the strength of an Immortal King at the middle stage was top-tier in the Immortal Realm.

After flying for seven days, Luo Tian finally reached a thousand zhang away from Eternal Life Mountain. He didn't directly head to Eternal Life Mountain. Knowing his current strength, he might be killed by the Immortal Emperor before even finding Zhang Daotian's other half of his soul. Thus, Luo Tian had already planned a strategy: to try and infiltrate Eternal Life Mountain. If Long Yuan's strength recovered somewhat, it might save his life. The Heaven-Repelling Stone was also a means of escape.

Luo Tian landed on a large mountain, continuously thinking about how to escape safely. After pondering for a while, he found no perfect plan—only one dead end.

"I can die, but I must find my master's soul and ensure his safety. He has suffered too much in this life!" Luo Tian's face showed determination.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian pondered, a streak of light passed over his head. A green robe with a flower on the sleeve, an old man's face with authority.

"Someone?"

"Never mind. With such proximity to Eternal Life Mountain, it's impossible here!" The old man, at the half-Immortal King stage, glanced at Luo Tian's mountain and shook his head lightly before flying away.

"Eternal Life Mountain?" As the old man was about to leave, a cold voice echoed in his ear. The old man's body froze, as if struck by lightning. A violent pressure directly pressed upon him, sending him like a meteor crashing onto Luo Tian's mountain.

"You..." The old man hurriedly stood up, kneeling on the ground in reverence. He bowed repeatedly.

"Respected elder, I didn't mean to offend you. Please consider me as nothing!" The old man continuously spoke, not even looking at Luo Tian before begging for mercy.

...Luo Tian observed the old man. Upon confirming he wore Eternal Life Mountain's attire, Luo Tian's gaze held a strange expression. In his mind, Eternal Life Mountain people were always aloof and arrogant.

"Too timid!" Luo Tian hadn't expected the old man to be so timid. After such a plea, Luo Tian felt reluctant to kill him.

"Speak up. What's your name? What position do you hold in Eternal Life Mountain?" Luo Tian spoke softly.

"I am Zhou Xiong, the 'Zhou' in 'One Zhou', and 'Xiong' meaning dominance. I am an outer gate elder of Eternal Life Mountain, tasked by the Immortal Emperor to search for强者 who entered the Immortal Mountain a year ago—Luo Tian!" The old man spoke directly, naturally explaining his purpose to Luo Tian.

"Still searching for me?" Luo Tian's brows slightly furrowed, gazing at the old man.

"You..." The old man trembled as he lifted his head. Upon seeing Luo Tian's face, he immediately lowered it.

"Dead... dead! I truly am doomed!" The old man mentally cursed himself for being blind. He hadn't expected to meet Luo Tian's true self.

"What kind of fate do I have? I never thought I'd encounter Luo Tian!" Zhou Xiong's thoughts differed from others. He knew Luo Tian's ferocity well. The task assigned by the Immortal Emperor was merely symbolic. Zhou Xiong never expected that the more he avoided finding Luo Tian, the more he encountered him—right near Eternal Life Mountain.

"I saw his face. This time I'm definitely dead!" Zhou Xiong's heart trembled, repeatedly bowing to Luo Tian without thinking of reporting his encounter with Luo Tian back to Eternal Life Mountain.

Boom... Boom... Boom...

Luo Tian's mountain constantly roared, causing Luo Tian to show a reluctant expression. He hadn't expected to meet such an oddity after leaving Gu Tian Court.

"Stand up first. I have some questions for you!" Luo Tian spoke softly, stopping Zhou Xiong from bowing but not daring to lift his head.

"Respected elder, I understand the rules. This is my life's savings. I absolutely won't look at your face. If you're not satisfied, you can erase my memory!"

"I swear, I won't reveal meeting the elder. If I break this oath, may heaven and earth destroy me!" Zhou Xiong spoke loudly, spitting blood as he made a blood oath.

"I won't kill you... Stand up. I have some questions for you!" Luo Tian no longer wanted to kill this man.

"Yes, respected elder!" Zhou Xiong trembled as he lifted his head. His heart sighed; he had saved a small life.

"Go change your pants..." Luo Tian slightly furrowed his brows, addressing Zhou Xiong. This frown made the wet mark on the ground larger.

"Respected elder, I'd rather not. If I change, maybe your aura will intimidate me. Changing would be in vain..." Zhou Xiong's face showed reverence, but he didn't want to do it. He couldn't control himself.

"Alright!" Luo Tian felt a headache, stepping back slightly.

"Still searching for me? They've been looking all along?" Luo Tian asked, feeling relieved he hadn't come out of the Immortal Mountain. If he had, he might have been hunted again.

"Not entirely. After you stormed into the Immortal Mountain, several strong individuals from other mountains left because they didn't believe you could come out. Only a few scattered cultivators, lured by the inheritance of the Fallen Heaven Emperor, followed you into the Immortal Mountain."

"We only recently received the Immortal Emperor's command to search for you!" Zhou Xiong revealed all he knew.

"Ah, then I'll委屈 myself a bit. Borrow something from you!" Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Zhou Xiong with a plan in mind.

"What do you need? Take it freely!" Zhou Xiong quickly spoke. To survive, he would exchange anything.

"Your body!" Luo Tian spoke softly, extending his hand to grab Zhou Xiong and pressing it on top of Zhou Xiong's head.

"Dead... I've lost my virtue..." Zhou Xiong's eyes rolled back. This was his last thought.

Soul-searching, Luo Tian directly searched Zhou Xiong's mind. All of Zhou Xiong's past appeared in Luo Tian's mind.

After an hour, Luo Tian transformed into Zhou Xiong's appearance. After confirming no differences, Luo Tian showed a satisfied expression.

"Master Qian's transformation technique is truly unique!" Luo Tian muttered. The reason for changing into Zhou Xiong's appearance wasn't due to the Thousand Faces Mask but a method from an elder of Gu Tian Court, Master Qian. This method didn't need to hide; ordinary people would definitely not detect the flaw, being more reliable than the Thousand Faces Mask.

Luo Tian's cultivation also dropped to the half-Immortal King level. This method was from Master Qian.

After confirming multiple times, Luo Tian took flight, heading toward Eternal Life Mountain. Half a day later, he reached the mountain's base, his face showing admiration.

"Less than a month left. I must find my master's other half of his soul and take it with me!" Luo Tian muttered, stepping onto the entrance of Eternal Life Mountain.

A mighty mountain exuded an ancient aura. Two True Immortal Stage disciples stood there, their eyes vacant, obviously not believing anyone would dare attack Eternal Life Mountain.

"Master Zhou!" Two disciples saw it was Zhou Xiong and quickly bowed, but the disdain in their eyes vanished briefly.

"Ah!" Luo Tian nodded, not acknowledging the two guards. Following Zhou Xiong's memories, he entered Eternal Life Mountain, feeling some tension.

Zhou Xiong was at the half-Immortal King level. As an outer gate elder, his position in Eternal Life Mountain wasn't top-tier but was still good. Thus, he had his own courtyard.

"This old man is truly a peculiar one!" Luo Tian muttered, recalling Zhou Xiong's memories.

In his memories, Zhou Xiong was a timid person. Everyone in Eternal Life Mountain, from elders to disciples, knew this. The most famous incident was when a half-Immortal King elder ordered Zhou Xiong to kneel, and he did. From then on, Zhou Xiong became a laughingstock in Eternal Life Mountain. However, disciples only mocked him secretly; publicly, Zhou Xiong was still an outer gate elder. No one wanted to offend him.

Luo Tian walked through, following Zhou Xiong's memories to find his courtyard. Though not large, it was still a decent one, about a thousand zhang in size.

"Master, you've returned!" As Luo Tian just entered the courtyard, a hesitant voice echoed in his ears. He slightly startled.

In front of him stood a young man, his face showing reverence. The youth was handsome but bore some bruises.

Chapter 2462: Plan

Zhou Yuanhao, an infant Zhou Xiong had adopted early on and taken as a disciple. Eternal Life Mountain's outer gate elder could take many disciples. If one of them had exceptional talent, the outer gate elder would eventually ascend to inner gate status without needing exams. Once at that level, they could become core members of Eternal Life Mountain.

Outer gate elders had hundreds in Eternal Life Mountain. Half-Immortal King-level outer gate elders were rare, with only a dozen or so, even some at True Immortal Stage. Each outer gate elder had many disciples. Zhou Xiong was an exception, having only one disciple. The reason was that Zhou Xiong was too timid. Previously, disciples had joined Zhou Xiong's group because of his half-Immortal King level but later betrayed him, switching to other True Immortal Stage elders. Because these disciples were bullied outside and Zhou Xiong didn't help them, instead ordering them to apologize to the others. This spread, and no one wanted to join Zhou Xiong's group.

The most important thing for outer gate elders was disciples. Besides resources from the sect, they also received gifts from their disciples. This was a significant income. Without this, Zhou Xiong and his disciple Zhou Yuanhao lived poorly, even worse than other True Immortal Stage elders and disciples.

"What's wrong?" Luo Tian looked at Zhou Yuanhao's bruises, smiling slightly.

"Nothing. Master, why did you return so quickly? Didn't you hear the sect's command to search for the Ghost Valley disciple?" Zhou Yuanhao asked, eyes full of confusion.

"I don't search; others will. Didn't I tell you before? Survival is most important!" Luo Tian spoke softly, not needing to act. He was naturally this age.

"Zhou... Master Zhou!" The voices of several young people echoed outside the courtyard. Several young figures appeared at the gate.

Luo Tian's brows slightly furrowed, turning to look at them. Several young people at the True Immortal Stage stood there, their faces arrogant.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian asked, gazing at Zhou Yuanhao. He knew this was related to Zhou Yuanhao.

"Master, our place has relatively rich spiritual energy. So after you left, they planned to drive me out. I definitely won't let that happen! This is our only place to stay!" Zhou Yuanhao spoke, lowering his head.

"Oh?" Luo Tian's eyes slightly narrowed. He gazed at the young people, causing their faces to change.

"Master Zhou! This is a misunderstanding!"

"We'll have our master come to apologize!" The young people quickly spoke. Zhou Xiong was an outer gate elder, half-Immortal King level. In the outer gate elders, he was top-tier. Though timid, they couldn't afford to provoke him.

"Go away! If you do it again, I won't forgive!" Luo Tian was too tired to argue with these True Immortal Stage youths. He turned toward the courtyard's depths.

"Yes!" The young people quickly bowed and left through the gate.

"Master Zhou really is so timid! He didn't even punish us!" After they left, they whispered, their voices filled with disdain.

Luo Tian walked slowly toward Zhou Xiong's room. Zhou Yuanhao followed behind, his face showing reverence.

"If you feel oppressed, you can transfer to another elder's group!" Luo Tian spoke softly, thinking this disciple of Zhou Xiong was a burden.

"Master, your kindness is great. You raised me. I won't leave Master!" Zhou Yuanhao quickly knelt before Luo Tian, speaking loudly.

"I made a mistake. I shouldn't have fought with them!" Zhou Yuanhao quickly knelt before Luo Tian, speaking loudly.

"An excellent disciple who repays kindness!" Luo Tian thought. Zhou Xiong was timid, but this disciple, Zhou Yuanhao, was a good candidate.

"Unfortunately, I have no time to take disciples!" Luo Tian muttered. He glanced at Zhou Yuanhao and spoke softly, "Alright, go do your duties. This pill can heal your injuries!"

Luo Tian extended his hand, sending a pill to Zhou Yuanhao's body. He stepped into the room.

Luo Tian entered the room, pondering what to do next. Time was truly short—only twenty days left.

"Only inner gate elders can access Eternal Life Mountain's core. How to become an inner gate elder?" Luo Tian muttered, his mind constantly forming plans.

"Directly becoming an inner gate elder by strength would be too noticeable!"

"Perhaps I can become an inner gate elder through Zhou Yuanhao. If his disciples enter the inner gate, then with Zhou Xiong's half-Immortal King level, he can become an inner gate elder without issue!" Luo Tian quickly formed a plan.

"Supreme Heaven Stone, go out. Search the entire Eternal Life Mountain thoroughly, not missing a single detail. But don't touch the treasure vaults; avoid drawing attention!"

"If you do, I won't forgive you. Try to find my master's whereabouts. If possible, bring him out directly; it would save trouble!" Luo Tian communicated with the Supreme Heaven Stone and sent it out.

Zhou Yuanhao had just swallowed the pill Luo Tian gave him. His injuries were instantly healed, still in awe of Luo Tian's elixir. Luo Tian's voice echoed in Zhou Yuanhao's mind.

Zhou Yuanhao didn't delay, quickly rising and appearing outside Luo Tian's room. He was confused—just met him before, didn't know why his master wanted to see him again.

"I observe that you're only a little away from the True Immortal Stage!"

"This pill, take it. Let me see your talent!" Luo Tian addressed Zhou Yuanhao.

Zhou Xiong had always raised Zhou Yuanhao freely, not investing much effort. Time was pressing; Luo Tian needed to know if Zhou Yuanhao had the talent. If he did, he could quickly enhance his strength. If not, Luo Tian would have to find other methods.

"Yes!" Zhou Yuanhao trusted Zhou Xiong completely. He swallowed the pill immediately.

... Waves flowed, Zhou Yuanhao's face changed instantly. A sensation flowed through his body, spreading to his limbs and joints. Then the sensation expanded violently, attacking Zhou Yuanhao's meridians.

Crackling sounds echoed. Zhou Yuanhao's face showed pain, sweat instantly flowing down.

Luo Tian lit a stick of incense, his gaze filled with smiles as he watched Zhou Yuanhao endure. Time flowed slowly. Zhou Yuanhao's face turned red, his body trembling constantly. His veins could be clearly seen, appearing ready to burst.

After a stick of incense passed, Luo Tian's eyes showed surprise. He could clearly feel Zhou Yuanhao was about to give out, with several meridians burst. This pain wasn't something ordinary people could endure.

Yet Zhou Yuanhao didn't utter a single sound. This made Luo Tian's eyes show admiration.

"His talent is average, but his endurance is remarkable. He can achieve something in the future!" Luo Tian made a decision. He extended his hand, sending out an attraction force that landed on Zhou Yuanhao's body. The terrifying medicinal power was drawn out by half.

"Boom..." As the medicinal power was drawn out, Zhou Yuanhao's face improved significantly. His body emitted a series of booming sounds.

"This..." Zhou Yuanhao's eyes showed shock, not daring to delay. He immediately started cultivating his power, refining the澎湃 medicinal energy within his body.

After half a day passed, Zhou Yuanhao's aura finally rose to the True Immortal Stage. His eyes showed wild joy.

"Thank you, Master!" Zhou Yuanhao quickly addressed Zhou Xiong, his voice filled with reverence.

"Yes. In ten days, reach the True Immortal Stage and enter the inner gate. You must prepare for a life beyond human limits!" Luo Tian smiled slightly, addressing Zhou Yuanhao. This made Zhou Yuanhao's body tremble.

"Ten days, True Immortal Stage! Master, you're not..." Zhou Yuanhao felt his master had gone mad after going out. Ten days to reach the True Immortal Stage—who could do that?

But Zhou Yuanhao had just reached the True Immortal Stage, already very excited. This stage had held him back for a long time.

"Rest well tonight. Tomorrow, start officially. Let you reach the True Immortal Stage in ten days!" Luo Tian's gaze held a slight smile. He knew Zhou Yuanhao didn't believe it.

Zhou Yuanhao bowed to Luo Tian, returning to his room. His heart was filled with excitement.

"Master, what did you experience during your trip? You've produced such a useful elixir!" Zhou Yuanhao muttered, sitting in meditation.

The next morning, as the sun rose, Luo Tian's voice echoed in Zhou Yuanhao's mind. He gave a start and quickly got up, leaving the room.

A large pot was set in the courtyard. The liquid inside boiled, bubbling with a green color that gave an unpleasant feeling.

"Enter!" Luo Tian extended his hand, grabbing Zhou Yuanhao and throwing him into the pot.

Zhou Yuanhao felt his master had a sadistic joy. He was immediately invaded by a stench, almost vomiting.

"Buzz..." A powerful aura pressed down, directly submerging Zhou Yuanhao under the surface. This elixir was what Luo Tian had drunk daily in Gu Tian Court's ruins, though diluted a hundredfold.

Chapter 2463: Duel
