When Jiang Sxi pointed at him, the young man’s face twisted with struggle. He knew his life no longer belonged to himself. With a grit of his teeth, he swallowed the floating elixir in front of him.

“Hum…” Like the previous young man, this one’s face was drenched in cold sweat. His body slowly cracked apart, on the verge of exploding from within.

“Return to me!” The young man roared, as if expending all his strength. His aura surged abruptly, causing those in the Concentration Soul Realm to instinctively retreat two steps.

“Half-step World Lord!” The crowd’s faces reflected disbelief, their gazes filled with a touch of envy.

“Just one elixir—yet it elevated a Concentration Soul Peak adept who had grasped a fragment of chaos power into Half-step World Lord. Even ninth-rank elixirs would struggle to achieve this!” Luotian marveled, his face aglow with radiant light.

“Beyond World Lord lies Supreme Lord. Then what rank lies beyond ninth-rank elixirs?” Luotian’s eyes gleamed with intense interest.

“This elixir doesn’t just take lives—it also greatly enhances strength if one survives!” Several people’s faces showed awe, their gazes turning to Jiang Sxi.

“Do you understand elixirs?” Sensing the light in Luotian’s eyes, Jiang Sxi shifted her gaze to him—the only World Lord among them.

“Slightly. I am a ninth-rank alchemist,” Luotian replied calmly, his lips curling into a faint smile as he addressed Jiang Sxi without bowing.

“Ninth-rank alchemist!” The dozen attendants around her faces showed shock, their gazes now fixed on Luotian. Even in the Blue Dragon Continent, a ninth-rank alchemist was considered highly skilled. To think Luotian, an unaffiliated cultivator and so young, was one of such caliber.

“Good. Then take this elixir,” Jiang Sxi said, tossing a pill before Luotian without regard for his status as a ninth-rank alchemist.

Luotian knew he couldn’t evade. Not only was that cursed headband above him, but three-source Supreme Lords were beyond his capacity to oppose.

“Eat it! Hope this woman doesn’t deceive me!” Luotian felt his inadequacy, a hint of resignation on his face as he placed the elixir into his mouth.

“Hum…” Upon ingestion, the elixir’s violent medicinal energy instantly invaded Luotian’s body, causing him to tremble involuntarily.

“Damn it!” Luotian’s forehead glistened with sweat, his face flushed red then purple. His entire body felt agonizing—alternately scorched by fire or frozen by ice. Even his formidable physique couldn’t withstand the elixir’s power.

“Five Elements Transformation Art!” Forced to employ this technique and his robust body, Luotian began refining the elixir’s chaotic energy.

“Interesting,” Jiang Sxi observed the nine-colored light radiating from Luotian, her face displaying surprise. She nodded slightly, as if discovering a precious treasure.

With the Five Elements Transformation Art refining the elixir’s energy, Luotian’s complexion gradually improved. After about an hour of refinement, he completed the process and opened his eyes, revealing sharp glimmers.

A thunderous rumble echoed within his body, filling Luotian with exhilaration. He could sense the elixir’s torment was immense but its medicinal power was colossal. Luotian was certain this elixir had been crafted from countless rare herbs. As a ninth-rank alchemist, he was certain of this.

“Waste!” Luotian shook his head, a disappointed expression on his face. Jiang Sxi’s gaze narrowed slightly.

“Describe your feelings,” Jiang Sxi spoke, still imperious.

“Firstly, the elixir’s temperature is definitely insufficient. The heat needs to be elevated further. If I’m not mistaken, this elixir contains Starfruit—a rare treasure of the world. Yet its terrifying star energy was severely lost. This waste of Starfruit’s properties—perhaps using Starbranch instead would be better,” Luotian mused, offering his insights.

The attendants’ faces showed confusion, but as Jiang Sxi’s gaze brightened, their looks toward Luotian shifted.

“Good. From today on, you’ll reside here. Each day, spend an hour with me to study the elixir formula,” Jiang Sxi said, a hint of satisfaction on her face before vanishing from the spot.

“Hello, I’m Zhang Qingsheng. Brother, look after us well from now on!” A young man spoke, smiling at Luotian. Others also greeted him with flattery.

Chapter 747: Killing

Feeling the gazes of a dozen people, Luotian smiled in return. As he had just entered the Blue Dragon Sect and was merely an attendant, making a few friends was beneficial. Though these people were only in the Concentration Soul Realm, their talents were undoubtedly outstanding—otherwise, those three-source Supreme Lords wouldn’t have chosen them as the first-tier geniuses’ attendants.

“Boom!” Just as Luotian and others were in a harmonious atmosphere, the courtyard’s door was kicked open by someone. A dozen figures filed in, entering Luotian’s view.

“Newcomer?” A young man with an air of arrogance, a World Lord-level cultivator, looked at Luotian and others.

Luotian’s group furrowed their brows. Though they were unaffiliated, they had grown accustomed to freedom; otherwise, these people’s talents wouldn’t have allowed them to lack a sect.

“Do you need something?” Zhang Qingsheng’s face showed impatience, looking at the young man. The latter also wore a golden headband, clearly an attendant.

“Newcomers don’t know the rules? Hand over your resources. We’re here to collect them for our master. You might ask who our master is—listen carefully!”

“Our master is Sun Shaohui, the second-ranked genius of Blue Dragon Sect, and his younger brother, Sun Shaowen!” The young man’s face showed arrogance as he commanded Luotian and others.

“Idiot!” Luotian mentally sighed. With such an idiotic attendant, the master was likely no smarter. He had ventured into Jiang Sxi’s territory to collect resources.

Yet the young attendant was formidable, a World Lord-level cultivator—reason enough for his arrogance.

“No!” Zhang Qingsheng and others showed coldness. Though their strength was vastly inferior, these resources were earned through countless perilous trials and sacrifices; they wouldn’t hand them over.

“Hmph. Seems you don’t know my methods!” The young man’s face showed disdain, vanishing from sight. A massive pressure instantly pressed upon Luotian and others. In the next moment, he appeared before Zhang Qingsheng, his palm swiftly slapping toward Zhang Qingsheng’s face.

Zhang Qingsheng, though only at the Concentration Soul Peak with a fragment of chaos power, had experienced countless near-death situations. He had his own methods against danger. Plus, the World Lord-level young man didn’t intend to kill outright, holding back his strength and landing the slap on Zhang Qingsheng’s shoulder instead.

“Crack…” The sound of bone breaking echoed in people’s ears, causing their hearts to tremble.

Zhang Qingsheng was sent flying, crashing onto the ground with his shoulder awkwardly drooping.

“This!” Luotian hadn’t expected the young man to act so swiftly, ignoring their status as Jiang Sxi’s attendants.

“Don’t you know we’re Jiang Sxi’s attendants? Dare to attack us?” One young man shouted, his face filled with indignation.

“Haha!” Hearing the shout, those who had entered showed disdain, scanning Luotian and others.

“Jiang Xianzi’s status is so high she wouldn’t care about these ant-like attendants!” The young man spoke loudly, his voice brimming with arrogance.

Luotian and others remained silent. Indeed, as the young man said, Jiang Sxi was aloof and didn’t care about their lives. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have used them to test elixirs.

“Take that World Lord—your valuable items must be many. Hand them over to our master. With his protection, you’ll remain safe in the Blue Dragon Sect!” The young man shifted his gaze to Luotian, his face showing greed. Each time he collected for his master, he always gained some profit. Over the years, he had accumulated much.

“Leave!” Luotian coldly spoke, his gaze on the young man, his face icy.

“You really think you’re someone important!” Seeing Luotian tell him to leave, the young man’s face showed a hint of cold killing intent.

Though killing was troublesome for him, with a little maneuvering, it wouldn’t be a problem.

“Die first!” Luotian had been suppressing himself since entering this star domain. Though not entirely desperate, he had reached his limit. If it weren’t for enhancing his strength and preserving his life, he wouldn’t have yielded to those three-source Supreme Lords earlier.

Now, a mere World Lord attendant dared to lord over him. Luotian could no longer contain himself. His face was filled with intense killing intent, his gaze like a thousand-year frost. His body seemed to transform into a golden-winged great peng, instantly appearing before the young man. Destruction Fist—his fist struck the young man’s body.

The arrogant young man was merely a World Lord. Though Luotian had dispersed some strength through his clone, he still had the upper hand against a World Lord.

The young man’s face showed fear. Luotian’s attack had been too swift, leaving him no time to react. He was struck solidly.

“Crack…” The sound of bones breaking echoed within the young man’s body. He vanished from sight, appearing high above in the sky, spitting blood profusely.

Luotian didn’t stop after knocking him away. He pushed off the ground, instantly appearing above the young man and kicking down with his foot, landing on the young man’s face. Like a mountain, he crashed onto the ground.

“Boom…” A thunderous sound echoed, causing the courtyard floor to rise in waves. A deep pit appeared before people’s eyes, making the surrounding attendants’ gazes narrow slightly, their faces filled with fear.

Blood splattered, wetting Luotian’s pants. Three soul essences emerged from the young man’s body, their faces filled with terror. In an instant, Luotian grabbed them in his hand, his face displaying endless coldness: “I told you to leave. You didn’t. Now can you still leave?”

“I’ll go… I’ll go…” The three soul essences’ faces showed endless terror, looking at Luotian as if he were the Yan Luo. They cried out for mercy.

“Destroy two of your soul essences. If you provoke me again, I’ll destroy all three!” Luotian grabbed one of the soul essences and released it. The moment it escaped, it flew away rapidly. Its face showed endless resentment: “You little bastard, what’s your name? I’ll never forgive this!”

“Die!” Luotian’s eyes flashed with killing intent. He flicked his finger, and a green flame instantly appeared, attaching to the remaining soul essence.

A scream echoed. A black smoke appeared before people’s eyes, causing those accompanying the young man to look at Luotian with fear.

“You killed Song Liguó!” The attendants accompanying the young man exclaimed, their gazes on Luotian. They hadn’t expected this newcomer attendant to dare kill so soon. Though attendants’ lives were unvalued, Song Liguó had thrived in the Blue Dragon Sect for years. Even some disciples were inferior to him. People knew Song Liguó was Sun Shaowen’s favored attendant, with Sun Shaohui, the second-ranked genius of Blue Dragon Sect, behind him.

“Leave… take this man’s corpse out!” Luotian scanned the noisy disciples, his gaze filled with determination. Since he had already killed, he didn’t mind adding a few more corpses.

“Yes… yes…” The attendants, heads bowed as if crushed, carried Song Liguó’s corpse and left the courtyard.

“Luotian, you killed him. There will be endless trouble afterward!” A young attendant, his face showing fear, spoke to Luotian.

“Don’t worry. Someone will handle it for us. Isn’t that right?” Luotian narrowed his eyes, his deep gaze looking toward a distant mountain peak.

“Interesting,” Jiang Sxi sat cross-legged on the mountain’s summit, her face showing a faint smile. Her gaze turned toward Luotian and others’ courtyard, her lips curving slightly.

“Want to prove your value? Killing a World Lord isn’t enough!” Jiang Sxi murmured, then closed her eyes again.

Seeing Luotian act as if nothing had happened, the other attendants intentionally kept their distance. Though Luotian was a World Lord-level strength, the Blue Dragon Sect’s depths were profound. They didn’t believe Luotian would be so bold, fearing he might drag them down.

Only Zhang Qingsheng, who had been injured by Song Liguó, showed respect toward Luotian—whether out of gratitude for avenging his broken arm or due to Luotian’s strength.

In the following days, Luotian didn’t encounter Song Liguó’s master. This puzzled him secretly.

Jiang Sxi, however, delivered a poison elixir daily, making Luotian suffer immensely while his strength rapidly ascended. Within days, he reached the Half-Step World Lord realm, filling Luotian with immense joy.

“If my clone returns, I could fully enter a Source Supreme Lord!” Luotian’s face showed confidence.

“I still need to wait. To enter a Supreme Lord, I must make it earth-shattering! A single-source Supreme Lord isn’t my goal. I aim for at least a two-source Supreme Lord!” Luotian sat in the courtyard, his face showing contemplation.

Luotian didn’t rush to recall his clone. Instead, he let the clone absorb enough dark attribute energy before remaining on the Black Rock Continent. In the underground of the Black Rock Continent, he found several Tongming Stones and began cultivating space之道.

Meanwhile, Luotian’s main body continuously trained while also cultivating his inner碧晶琉璃火 (Blue Crystal Glaze Fire), knowing it was a treasure of the world, beneficial for cultivating fire之道.

After Luotian calmly passed a month, Jiang Sxi’s clear voice echoed in his ears: “Come to the main peak! Blue Dragon Arena!”

Chapter 748: Blue Dragon Arena

Luotian sat in the courtyard, his brows furrowed. A month had passed, and he fully understood life within the Blue Dragon Sect. As an attendant, it was relatively easy—except for his master’s needs, other times were free. Especially as a World Lord-level cultivator, he held some status within the Blue Dragon Sect. Others at the Concentration Soul Peak were often at the mercy of their lives, unlike Luotian. In recent days, of the nineteen attendants who had entered with him, only ten remained. Some had offended other disciples accidentally; others had died while testing elixirs for Jiang Sxi.

Zhang Qingsheng, perhaps due to his closeness with Luotian, had been spared by Jiang Sxi from testing elixirs. Of course, Luotian was forced to eat two more.

At this moment, hearing Jiang Sxi’s mental call, the command was unmistakable. Though Luotian felt some annoyance, he obeyed due to his strength and stepped out of the courtyard.

Along the way, the golden headband on his head was unusually eye-catching, earning disdainful glances from disciples.

Those attendants who met him along the way had their gazes changed. Though Song Liguó wasn’t among the highest-ranked attendants, he was somewhat famous. Luotian’s killing of him naturally drew attention from the attendants, and Luotian’s name spread among them.

Luotian wore an indifferent expression as he walked to the main peak. A towering arena, its air heavy with bloodiness, made Luotian frown slightly.

The Blue Dragon Arena was a place where Blue Dragon Sect disciples thrilled. Especially the geniuses and descendants of old masters loved coming here, as it was not only a place for disciples to compete but also a battleground where attendants feared.

The Blue Dragon Arena had an animal arena and a human arena. Some纨绔 disciples liked to have their attendants fight here. Naturally, these disciples never cared about the attendants’ lives, and fights were often one death, one survival. Though disciples found it exciting, for the attendants on stage, it was a test of life and death.

Luotian furrowed his brows. His spiritual sense spread, quickly finding Jiang Sxi’s position. Before her stood a man with an icy expression, gazing at the arena.

Two attendants with golden headbands were fighting on the stage. The battle had reached its end. A Concentration Soul Peak warrior stood, grabbing another and tearing him apart with a mighty roar.

The surrounding disciples watched the bloody scene with wild expressions, shouting approval.

“Monster!” Luotian mentally cursed as he passed through the crowd and stood behind Jiang Sxi.

“Sxi, this is that attendant who recently gained some fame?” As Luotian stood behind Jiang Sxi, Sun Shaohui spoke, his face calm but voice soft.

“Kid, you killed my man. Think it’s over?” Sun Shaohui’s companion, a youth resembling him by 40%, looked at Luotian with mockery.

“Not over. What else can you do?” With Jiang Sxi’s support, Luotian smiled and spoke without treating himself as an attendant. His gaze even showed amusement toward Sun Shaowen.

“An attendant dares to challenge me? Though the Blue Dragon Sect has some attendants who are quite strong, even I can’t easily move against them. But you aren’t among them!” Sun Shaowen’s status was clear; Luotian’s words had clearly angered him.

“Jiang Senior, I suppose you won’t object if I punish this attendant?” Sun Shaowen changed his expression and spoke to Jiang Sxi.

Before Jiang Sxi could respond, Sun Shaowen moved his hands. A strange fluctuation formed in his hands, leaving Luotian puzzled.

But the next moment, Luotian felt what Sun Shaowen was doing. The intense pain nearly made him pass out.

The golden headband on his head emitted radiant gold light, illuminating the entire Blue Dragon Arena.

“Who? Activated the punishment headband!” Seeing the golden light, Blue Dragon Sect disciples showed excitement, turning their gazes toward its source.

The golden headband attendants also looked curiously at Luotian, sensing the long time since anyone had activated the binding headband. Only a few people in the Blue Dragon Sect knew how to activate it, and Sun Shaohui was one of them. He had taught this method to his younger brother, Sun Shaowen.

“Die!” As Sun Shaowen’s hand sign completed, Jiang Sxi’s face darkened. She moved like a gust of fragrance and instantly appeared before Sun Shaowen, kicking him.

“Crack…” Sun Shaowen’s arm, still forming the hand sign, was completely crushed by Jiang Sxi’s kick. His face changed from confidence to pain.

“Release!” After this, Jiang Sxi pointed her finger. A series of seals flew from her hand and landed on Luotian’s head. The golden light faded, revealing Luotian with a pale face.

“Drip… drip…” Cold sweat flowed down Luotian’s face, wetting the ground. Though only a moment had passed, he felt it stretched for countless days.

The feeling of having his life controlled by others and the excruciating pain that felt like his head would explode—despite Luotian’s strong will, he was shaken. That feeling couldn’t be described in words.

“This cursed headband must be removed; otherwise, I’ll always be under the Blue Dragon Sect’s control!” Luotian felt a storm within. He hadn’t expected this headband to be so powerful, regretting his hasty decision to come.

“Sxi, you used a slave-like thing to attack my brother!” Sun Shaohui’s face showed dissatisfaction but his eyes were filled with shock.

Sun Shaohui, the second-ranked genius of Blue Dragon Sect and a two-source Supreme Lord, had thought he was on par with Jiang Sxi. However, Jiang Sxi’s attack left him no time to stop it, shocking Sun Shaohui.

“Brother, I want this attendant dead!” Sun Shaowen couldn’t anger Jiang Sxi but took it out on Luotian.

Sun Shaohui nodded slightly. His aura transformed into a mountain, pressing heavily toward Luotian.

“Crack…” Though Luotian could withstand the pressure of a two-source Supreme Lord, he wasn’t calm. After all, it was a Supreme Lord—higher by one life level than the World Lord.

Supreme Lord Nine Heavens, each step a leap to heaven. People often used this phrase to describe the gap between Supreme Lord realms. Luotian and Sun Shaohui’s difference was immense, spanning a whole level.

“Sun Shaohui, don’t be so reckless or I’ll no longer give you face!” Jiang Sxi’s face darkened, her eyes flashing with light. She gazed at Sun Shaohui.

Seeing Jiang Sxi truly angry, Sun Shaohui’s face changed. He spoke softly: “Sxi, the situation is already this way. There’s no room for compromise. To avoid harming our relationship, let’s have a life-or-death battle between attendants!”

“Stop talking nonsense. You’ve called me here for this attendant, so if you say life-or-death battle, then let it be a life-or-death battle. I can dominate over you in every aspect!” Jiang Sxi showed impatience.

“Good! Best of three?” Sun Shaohui smiled upon Jiang Sxi’s agreement. Luotian was a target for Sun Shaohui, who had a million ways to silently kill him. Whether in status or strength, Sun Shaohui was far superior to Luotian—there was no comparison.

But Sun Shaohui’s intention in proposing this battle had another purpose. His gaze turned to a young man standing behind Jiang Sxi, whose face was resolute.

Li Naiyang, the seventh-ranked genius of Blue Dragon Sect. He was relatively low-key but renowned. A one-source Supreme Lord who had once fought a two-source Supreme Lord without falling behind.

But two years ago, Li Naiyang did something that caused a huge uproar in the Blue Dragon Sect. He challenged Jiang Sxi and lost, yet voluntarily wore the golden headband symbolizing an attendant, becoming Jiang Sxi’s attendant. Whether he was enchanted by Jiang Sxi or had some prior agreement, it remained unclear.

Li Naiyang became Jiang Sxi’s attendant. The entire Blue Dragon Sect was shocked, even the sect elders were furious. It was easy to wear the golden headband but nearly impossible to remove it.

Later, several elders combined their efforts to alter Li Naiyang’s headband, making only Jiang Sxi able to command it. This incident was resolved.

This time, Sun Shaohui’s true goal was Li Naiyang. Jiang Sxi’s strength was already terrifying; now with Li Naiyang, the sixth-ranked genius, others had no chance to rival Jiang Sxi. Thus, Sun Shaohui wanted to use this opportunity to eliminate Li Naiyang and weaken Jiang Sxi’s strength.

“You don’t care about your purpose with Jiang Sxi, but you must die!” Sun Shaohui thought coldly. His gaze met Li Naiang’s, forgetting about Luotian entirely.

Chapter 749: The Strongest Attendant

Feeling Sun Shaohui’s gaze, Jiang Sxi’s lips slightly curled. She knew the worth of Sun Shaohui’s attendants.

“Enough, let’s get this over with!” Jiang Sxi showed impatience, frowning slightly. She wanted a swift resolution.

With the second-ranked genius present, Blue Dragon Sect disciples naturally cleared the arena for Jiang Sxi and Sun Shaohui. The news of their attendants’ life-or-death battle spread quickly, drawing more disciples to the arena. They placed bets on the outcome.

“This is a no-brainer. Bet on Jiang Senior’s side! Jiang Senior has Li Naiyang as her attendant. Unless that legendary figure appears, no one can match Li Naiyang!”
“Hmph, let’s wait. Sun Shaohui isn’t a fool. Though attendants are easy to find, strong ones are hard to come by. He wouldn’t be so reckless!” People chattered, their gazes filled with anticipation. The Blue Dragon Sect hadn’t seen such high-level conflicts in a long time. This development had them excited.

“Luotian, this started because of you. You must go. Li Naiyang, I entrust you with this. Also, Zhao Tianming, you must go too. Remember, in the Blue Dragon Arena, anything can happen. Don’t underestimate any enemy!” Jiang Sxi instructed Luotian and the two others.

Luotian slowly stepped forward, standing behind Li Naiyang and Zhao Tianming. He remained unusually low-key.

Li Naiyang was a one-source Supreme Lord, while Luotian and Zhao Tianming were Half-Step Supreme Lords. Their levels were roughly equivalent, but Luotian was confident he could defeat Zhao Tianming in a minute.

Seeing Luotian step forward, Sun Shaowen, who had just recovered, showed a sinister expression. He coldly spoke: “Kid, you’re dead. You insulted me and still want to live? That’s pure fantasy!”

“Damn annoying!” Luotian ignored Sun Shaowen’s words, feeling he was like a fly, irritating him.

At the same time, Sun Shaohui called three attendants with golden headbands to his side. His face showed mockery.

Upon seeing the three, the crowd in the arena and below erupted with noise. Their gazes turned to one of them—a young man with a calm face and ordinary appearance.

“Kong Mingzi!” Jiang Sxi’s gaze also darkened, her eyes on the young man with a headband. His appearance was too ordinary; no one had noticed him before. Now, his presence made people excited.

Kong Mingzi was the strongest attendant of Blue Dragon Sect—without a doubt. Kong Mingzi had once emerged from the Blue Dragon Arena, killing and advancing through countless battles daily. He had set a record of fighting 300 matches in one day, with all opponents slain by him. Even Jiang Sxi would be wary of Kong Mingzi.

Kong Mingzi, a one-source Supreme Lord, was considered invincible at his level by the sect elders.

Behind Kong Mingzi stood two Half-Step Supreme Lords, their auras radiating powerful fluctuations. They were no less formidable than Zhao Tianming.

“Is that Jin Wuming? Another top-tier attendant of Sun Shaohui!” People chattered, their gazes filled with admiration as they looked at the three calm young men before Sun Shaohui.

“This is going to be interesting. The strongest attendants of Blue Dragon Sect are about to fight in a life-or-death battle. Truly exciting!” People looked at the six of them, excluding Luotian. The other five were considered the strongest attendants in Blue Dragon Sect and held status comparable to true disciples.

Though Luotian was a Half-Step Supreme Lord, people didn’t believe he could match the five. Especially Li Naiyang and Kong Mingzi—compared to Luotian, they were like heaven and earth. People’s gazes toward Luotian showed pity.

“Trouble,” Jiang Sxi furrowed her brows, a contemplative expression on her face. She hadn’t expected Sun Shaohui to ally with Kong Mingzi.

“Can we start?” Sun Shaohui smiled, addressing Jiang Sxi.

Jiang Sxi’s face darkened at his expression. She gazed thoughtfully before nodding slightly.

“I’ll go first!” After their agreement, one of Sun Shaohui’s attendants showed a fierce battle spirit. He leaped onto the arena, his gaze filled with killing intent toward Luotian and others.

Jiang Sxi furrowed her brows, scanning the three. She finally focused on Zhao Tianming.

“You go,” Jiang Sxi encouraged Zhao Tianming with a slight smile.

“Yes!” As an attendant who had followed Jiang Sxi for years, Zhao Tianming never disobeyed her. Her decisions had never led him to failure.

Zhao Tianming’s feet glowed with light, his face showing battle spirit. A green staff appeared in his hand.

“Zhao Tianming?” The attendant’s face showed fierce battle spirit, his eyes gleaming with bloodlust. Without hesitation, he drew his sword and instantly appeared before Zhao Tianming.

The battle of a Half-Step Supreme Lord was earth-shattering. If not for the Blue Dragon Continent’s stable space compared to Tianyuan Continent, one slash could have torn open vast voids.

The Blue Dragon Arena had been reinforced with special arrays, so the slash’s power didn’t damage surrounding space or the arena.

Seeing the young man attack, Zhao Tianming smiled. His aura surged abruptly, and he swung his staff to meet the young man’s sword.

“Crack…” A terrifying fluctuation echoed. Invisible waves swirled beneath them as both retreated, their gazes filled with seriousness.

But after retreating, they both shot toward each other like arrows, becoming streaks of light.

“Both have four-element body types!” Luotian observed the glowing auras on them, his mind shocked. Indeed, these were Blue Dragon Sect’s most talented attendants—their talent was terrifying.

“Come on, everyone stop watching and place your bets! Jiang Senior wins with six to one odds. Sun Senior’s win is four to one!” A young disciple stood among the crowd, a table before him. He shouted loudly.

The surrounding disciples showed confusion, then observed Luotian and Li Naiyang. They all bet on Sun Shaohui’s victory.

“Haha, Sima Qiong, you’re still the same. Always love gambling! This amount of money, do you care?” Seeing the young man shouting in the crowd, Sun Shaohui smiled.

“Sima Qiong?” Luotian turned his gaze to the young man with gleaming eyes, a glint of light in his own. Sima Qiong was also one of Blue Dragon Sect’s geniuses, ranked third. Luotian knew this man loved gambling and had long set up matches at the Blue Dragon Arena, betting on who would win.

Some disciples were happy to gamble, enhancing their excitement. Sima Qiong had excellent gambling ethics; even if he lost everything, he would repay his debts by selling treasures.

“Jiang Senior, let’s gamble too!” Sun Shaohui smiled, waving his hand. A golden sword appeared in his hand.

The moment the sword appeared, it illuminated the sky. Dragon roars surrounded it, causing people to gasp in admiration.

“Dragon Roar Sword! This is a big gamble. This sword was said to be a gift from Sun Shaohui’s seven-source Supreme Lord elder when he entered the one-source Supreme Lord. Now, Sun Senior has taken it as a bet!” The disciples chattered, their faces filled with envy as they looked at Sun Shaohui’s golden sword.

“Do you really think you’ve already won? I’ll bet,” Jiang Sxi didn’t hesitate. She produced a jade bottle floating before her.

“Imperial-grade elixir!” Upon seeing the bottle, Luotian felt its grade. After these days of an hour’s exchange with Jiang Sxi on elixir knowledge, he knew that ninth-rank elixirs were followed by Imperial-grade.

“Big gamble! A historic big gamble!” The Blue Dragon Sect disciples erupted in excitement. As both sides revealed their treasures, the disciples were like ignited, cheering loudly.

Just as people erupted in excitement, a powerful rumble and terrifying fluctuations echoed from the arena. People were startled, their gazes turning to Zhao Tianming. He swung his staff and smashed the young man who was in disarray, killing him instantly.

Blood splattered everywhere. One strike and the young man’s soul essence didn’t even escape, dying with his body on the Blue Dragon Arena.
