“Ha ha... I claim this... all of it!” Long Baobao, like a golden whirlwind, began ravaging the entire Lishui City.

Luotian, burdened with the task of paying for Long Baobao’s antics, discovered he had no funds left upon touching his storage ring.

Suddenly recalling the time in Kunlun Mountain’s Yuling Sect, when he had expended two hundred million Qi stones to break through the Bone-Consuming Peak, Luotian now found himself once again destitute.

Fortunately, Zheng Xin, the second son of the Wind-Blade Valley, was present; otherwise, Luotian would have been humiliated today.

Long Baobao’s body was once again laden with storage bags, his face beaming as he stood at the city governor’s mansion entrance. A bashful expression adorned his small face, evidently recalling his past stay there and feeling embarrassed to enter.

Yet soon after, a golden light rose from within the city governor’s mansion, which Long Baobao mistook for a “treasure”’s radiance. With a kick of his legs, he dashed into the mansion’s gates, invisible winds sending two body-tempering ninth-rank guards flying.

Luotian and Zheng Xin each appeared instantly before the two guards, supporting them as they fell.

Long Baobao laughed heartily, rushing toward the golden light.

A radiant golden beam surged from the mansion’s backyard into the sky, causing Luotian and Zheng Xin to furrow their brows.

“This is a Qi fluctuation of the Golden Element! Someone’s troubling Ding Yuanshan?” Luotian frowned, unwilling to involve Ding Yuanshan but now confronted with an intruder in the city governor’s mansion.

Recalling Ding Yuanshan’s kindness, Luotian resolved to aid him through this crisis.

After helping the guards up, the two vanished in three breaths, arriving at the mansion’s backyard.

Upon entering, their expressions darkened: Ding Yuanshan stood battered, while his daughter Ding Xiaoyan was also present, blood trickling from her lips, eyes burning with hatred.

Opposite them stood an elderly man in gray robes, his back bearing a long sword, eyes sinister as he glared at Ding Yuanshan and his daughter.

What shocked Luotian and Zheng Xin was the elder’s cultivation—Soul-Realm Initial Stage.

Feeling their presence, all eyes turned to Luotian and Zheng Xin. The elder lifted Long Baobao in his grasp, a mocking smile on his face.

“Lu…” Ding Xiaoyan froze upon seeing Long Baobao burst into the backyard, instantly recognizing the child as the one who shadowed Luotian.

As she prepared to call out Luotian’s name, she abruptly clamped her mouth shut.

Luotian observed the scene, his face hardening upon seeing Long Baobao in the elder’s grip: “Release him!”

Seeing Luotian and Zheng Xin arrive in Lishui City, the elder’s face flickered with surprise. He knew Zheng Xin but had only seen Luotian’s portrait in Kunlun Mountain, not his true form.

“You are Luotian! You killed my disciple Dong Xingxie?” The elder’s eyes burned with icy hatred.

“Luotian! I never expected you to come here yourself!” Dong Zimmo sneered, his gaze seething.

Dong Zimmo’s eyes blazed with fury; Dong Xingjian and Dong Xingxie, his two sons, had perished at Luotian’s hands. The agony of such a fate nearly broke him.

Since learning of his sons’ deaths, Dong Zimmo had relentlessly sought the killer—Luotian’s name was the most damning. With Dong Xingxie’s master Lin Changqing’s arrival, this suspicion was confirmed: Luotian had slain his sons.

Chapter 431: Battle Against a Soul-Realm Initial Stage

Luotian furrowed his brows, watching Long Baobao thrash in Lin Changqing’s grip. With a kick of his feet, he unleashed the fourth step of Fengtian Step and launched Mist Destruction Fist toward Lin Changqing.

“This…” Lin Changqing, a Soul-Realm Initial Stage powerhouse, had not anticipated Luotian’s audacity.

At his current strength, Mist Destruction Fist could wound a Soul-Realm powerhouse significantly.

Feeling the fist’s potency, Lin Changqing’s expression shifted; he attempted to dodge but was blindsided by Long Baobao’s sudden attack. The child bit into Lin Changqing’s arm with ferocious teeth.

“Hmph…” Lin Changqing sneered, dismissing the child’s act. He was a Soul-Realm powerhouse; his body strength far surpassed that of Bone-Consuming Stage.

But as a searing pain shot through his arm, Lin Changqing gasped, his face flushing red. Instinctively, he loosened his grip on Long Baobao.

Long Baobao vanished as a golden streak, reappearing before Zheng Xin.

In that split second, Luotian’s Mist Destruction Fist struck. His strength had surpassed Bone-Consuming Peak by leaps and bounds.

Seven-colored fists, imbued with Mist Destruction’s power, roared toward Lin Changqing, colliding with thunderous force.

“Pang…” Lin Changqing staggered backward, his face etched with shock. He could not fathom a Bone-Consuming Peak powerhouse repelling him.

Five hundred years of vitality vanished from Lin Changqing, shaking his spirit.

Ding Yuanshan and Ding Xiaoyan gaped in disbelief at Luotian’s feat.

When Luotian had left Lishui City, his external cultivation had merely been Body-Tempering Ninth Stage. After unsealing his restrictions, he reached Bone-Consuming Mid-Stage. Within half a year, he ascended to Bone-Consuming Peak—surpassing even the lofty Soul-Realm. This talent was nothing short of monstrous.

Ding Xiaoyan’s face twisted with complex emotions; though she had reached Bone-Consuming Late Stage, she now lagged far behind Luotian.

Her eyes snapped open as a memory resurfaced: the legend of “Bending the Bow to Kill a Soul-Realm” at Kunlun Mountain. An elder of Yuling Sect had perished under Luotian’s fist.

This legend was not unique to Ding Xiaoyan; Lin Changqing too recalled Luotian’s terror. Coupled with his recent defeat, his gaze toward Luotian brimmed with fear.

Long Baobao growled, baring his tiny fangs, and lunged at Lin Changqing. The child had clearly suffered enough humiliation and sought vengeance.

Luotian snatched him back, his face grim. He knew his limits—surviving a Soul-Realm Initial Stage was possible, but defeating one remained distant.

“You killed my only disciple. Even if you are Yuling Sect’s junior master, I will not let you live!” Lin Changqing hissed, drawing his sword.

The blade gleamed emerald, radiating waves of killing intent as it slashed toward Luotian.

“Perfect—test my strength against this Lin Changqing!” Luotian’s battle spirit surged. He had no idea his current power, but Bone-Consuming Peak opponents were trivial. With Lin Changqing here, he could gauge his true potential.

To ensure safety, Luotian sealed Long Baobao and Zheng Xin within his Naling Bag, fearing for their lives.

“You dare?” Luotian sneered, launching Fengtian Step and striking Dong Zimmo.

“Crack…” Dong Zimmo barely comprehended the attack before his chest caved in, blood spewing as he was hurled back.

“Pang…” Dong Zimmo’s eyes still held shock as Luotian’s fist left him battered.

“Die!” Lin Changqing snarled, enraged by Luotian’s audacity. His sword slashed toward Luotian with fury.

This strike bore Lin Changqing’s wrath and the might of a Soul-Realm Initial Stage, crashing down.

“Rip Sky Spear!” Luotian roared, summoning his spear. Seven-colored Qi coalesced into a dragon, clashing with the sword’s energy.

The city governor’s mansion trembled under their clash, nearby structures collapsing under Ding Yuanshan and Ding Xiaoyan’s stunned gaze.

“Can Luotian truly fight a Soul-Realm?” Ding Yuanshan murmured, seeking confirmation from his daughter.

“Legends say a Soul-Realm Initial Stage elder perished at Luotian’s hands!” Ding Xiaoyan sighed, bitterness in her voice.

Hearing this, Ding Yuanshan’s face paled, his emotions a whirlwind as he stared at Luotian.

Before they could speak further, Luotian appeared before them, sealing both into the Naling Bag—his gratitude for Ding Yuanshan’s past kindness.

“Youngling, you are formidable… truly formidable. In Bone-Consuming Stage, you are unmatched; even Soul-Realm masters struggle against you. But remember, I am a sword cultivator—my strength lies in attack!” Lin Changqing’s shock flickered, his body moving like lightning as sword energy surged.

“Bilin Qingjian!” Lin Changqing bellowed, green sword energy spewing forth—a serpentine blade of emerald.

“Wood Element’s essence!” Luotian grimaced, watching the serpent grow toward him. He knew the life force it carried concealed deadly power.

“Mist Destruction!” Luotian roared, unleashing two fists of Mist Destruction. These were his peak strikes, capable of erasing Bone-Consuming Stage life and wounding Soul-Realm.

The gray mist clashed with the green serpent, hissing as they merged.

As Luotian’s fists pressed against the serpent, it shrank, becoming ethereal before striking him.

“Pang…” Luotian staggered back, toppling walls before halting. Yet as he stopped, his hair lengthened visibly, cascading past his waist.

“Mist Destruction!” Luotian barked, striking himself. Under Lin Changqing’s gaze, his hair reverted to its original length.

“Unbelievable—he has mastered the Wood Element’s essence at Bone-Consuming Peak!” Lin Changqing marveled, his admiration for Luotian’s talent tempered by fear. His sword danced, launching another assault.

“Come on!” Luotian sneered. He feared no Soul-Realm melee combat; while other aspects might lag, his body strength rivaled ordinary Soul-Realm Initial Stage.

With a kick of his feet, cracks splintered beneath him as Rip Sky Spear hummed back into his grasp.

Luotian and Lin Changqing clashed like lightning, their collisions sending shockwaves that toppled parts of the city governor’s mansion.

The entire Lishui City trembled, its people cowering as the mansion’s aura repelled them. Some fled the city entirely.

Dong Zimmo, rescued by Lin Changqing earlier, now bore a pale face. Seeing Luotian and Lin Changqing’s clash without falling behind, his eyes darkened with fury.

“I will kill you! You killed my sons!” Dong Zimmo hissed, lighting a stick of incense from his storage ring.

As the incense burned, green smoke spiraled skyward, drifting toward Bichang County—the prison-like region of the Eastern Domain.

Luotian panted heavily, his body bearing wounds from the clash. Lin Changqing fared better but was equally battered, his mind awestruck by Luotian’s strength.

Their clash ended with a separation. Lin Changqing’s eyes gleamed as green Qi surged behind him, his wings unfurling to lift him a thousand feet into the sky.

“Kid! What else do you have?” Lin Changqing taunted, his sword slashing downward.

“Damn it, he’s flying again!” Luotian cursed internally, evading the sword energy with Fengtian Step.

“Boom… boom…” The mansion echoed with explosions.

This time, Luotian could only endure the onslaught, unable to retaliate. His frustration mounted; while Fengtian Step’s fourth stage was no longer taxing, prolonged use would drain him.

The gap between Bone-Consuming and Soul-Realm was evident—Soul-Realm masters never ran out of Qi, unlike Bone-Consuming Stage cultivators who needed cultivation and pills to recover.

“Fool! Let me fly!” Luotian roared, his Qi凝聚 into a seven-colored bow in his hands. This bow consumed half his Qi.

“Bending the Bow to Kill a Soul-Realm!” Lin Changqing recalled Luotian’s past feat, his fear palpable. He halted his attack, wings flaring skyward.

“Hmph!” Luotian sneered, Rip Sky Spear nocked on the bow. He aimed at Lin Changqing’s ascending form.

As Lin Changqing ascended, a shiver ran through him. Then he felt an ominous wind.

Luotian’s lips curled, releasing the bowstring. Rip Sky Spear vanished from his grasp, streaking skyward like a rainbow.

“Wow… so beautiful… a rainbow!” Some commoners, fleeing the mansion’s chaos, marveled at the sky’s spectacle.

Yet cultivators trembled; they knew this beauty concealed terrifying power.

Rip Sky Spear struck Lin Changqing, tearing through his body with a scream of anguish.

“Puo…” Lin Changqing’s body plummeted from two thousand feet, his face ashen.

The fall’s gravity could have killed a Soul-Realm Initial Stage master.

Boom echoed as Lin Changqing’s body crushed half the mansion.

Dong Zimmo, bloodied and wounded, stared at Lin Changqing with dread. His comprehension shattered—how could a Bone-Consuming Peak cultivator kill a Soul-Realm?

Though Lin Changqing remained alive, his injuries—both soul and body—would take time to heal.

Lin Changqing regretted his arrogance, flying skyward instead of fighting on the ground where he might have won.

But it was too late; his overconfidence led to defeat.

Lin Changqing felt his strength dwindle to less than ten percent of its former might. Though Rip Sky Spear was manageable, the soul-technique’s damage was immense. He never imagined Luotian’s soul strength could be so formidable.

Luotian observed Lin Changqing, now helpless and wounded. He nodded in respect for the Soul-Realm’s might—such a fall had not killed him.

“Just delayed death,” Luotian mused, gripping Rip Sky Spear as he approached Lin Changqing.

Lin Changqing’s expression shifted from arrogance to fear, his eyes wide as he stared at Luotian.

Rip Sky Spear’s tip dripped with Lin Changqing’s blood, its cold light gleaming.

“You cannot kill me! I am a Yuntian Sect elder!” Lin Changqing pleaded, his voice trembling.

“Yuling Sect elders I’ve killed—what makes you different?” Luotian scoffed.

Hearing this, Lin Changqing’s soul quaked. He had left Kunlun Mountain on his own accord; after Duan Xingchen’s rescue, the Yuntian Sect had ordered no contact with Luotian. Lin Changqing’s hatred blinded him, but now death loomed.

“Buzz…” Luotian’s feet propelled him forward as Rip Sky Spear hummed, streaking toward Lin Changqing.

But before he reached him, a golden sword materialized beneath his feet.

“Stop!” The blade embedded itself in the ground, its hilt visible. Cracks splintered the earth around it.

Luotian halted, his face grim as he gazed skyward.

“Grandfather!” Dong Zimmo’s face lit up, shouting toward the figure above.

At the city governor’s mansion, an elderly man in his sixties furrowed his brows, his expression stern as he gazed at Luotian.

“Dong Zimmo… what is it? You’ve used the Tian Can Incense!” The elder glared at the wounded Dong Zimmo.

“Grandfather, this concerns Jinjin City’s survival. I had no choice but to summon you!” Dong Zimmo wept, recounting the tale of his sons’ deaths and Luotian’s strength.

Upon hearing of Dong Xingxie and Dong Xingjian’s demise, the elder’s face darkened. They were his favored disciples—Jinjin City’s hope for rising to Kunlun Mountain. Yet this boy had slain them all.

Fury radiated from the elder, his gaze sharp as he locked onto Luotian.

“Soul-Realm Late Stage!” Luotian’s face darkened, recognizing the elder’s power. He doubted this Soul-Realm Late Stage master had come to chat.

“Good, even if you are Yuling Sect’s junior master, I will kill you today!” The elder sneered, his Soul-Realm Late Stage aura surging.

The ground trembled as the sword quivered, its hum resonating with his wrath.

“Pang…” The blade flashed like lightning, slicing toward Luotian with the Dragon-Slaying Sword Technique.

This technique surpassed Dong Xingxie’s by leaps, rivaling a Grade-A Martial Art.

The golden sword radiated brilliance, its edges carving rifts in the air as Luotian knew it could sever reality itself.

“Old fool!” Luotian’s eyes burned with madness, stunned the elder had attacked without mercy.

Luotian understood that against a Soul-Realm Late Stage, even escape was uncertain.

“Zhenhun Ding!” Luotian roared, summoning his Zhenhun Ding. The lid lifted slightly as he vanished into it, escaping the elder’s strike.

“Crack…” The lid closed behind him.

As the Zhenhun Ding sealed, the elder’s Dragon-Slaying Sword Energy struck it.

“Boom…” Thunder cracked like a midday lightning strike, shaking all of Lishui City. Even those who had fled the city felt their mouths and eyes bleed.

“Flee!” Panic spread among cultivators and commoners alike, their fear driving them from the city.

Chapter 432: Using the Soul-Stealing Seal Again

The golden sword energy collided with Zhenhun Ding, embedding it into the ground. Luotian, within the ding, felt a shiver of relief.

At this moment, Zhenhun Ding had accepted him as its master; the void was now a space several zhang wide, devoid of anything.

“Can’t fight directly—must hide. Soul-Realm Late Stage is terrifying!” Luotian sighed, aware he was no match for the elder.

“Hmph…” The elder’s gaze flickered with surprise, his eyes narrowing at the Zhenhun Ding. His Dragon-Slaying Sword Energy had been formidable, having slain a dragon near Soul-Realm Initial Stage.

Though the dragon was only Soul-Realm Initial, its beastly body defied ordinary sword energy.

Yet now, the Zhenhun Ding bore no mark but a faint white imprint, restoring itself within half a breath. This ignited the elder’s greed.

“Pang…” Luotian felt the silence outside and, with his soul sense, lifted the Zhenhun Ding’s lid. He burst out like a firecracker, retrieving the ding and fleeing into Lishui City’s outskirts.

“Trying to escape?” The elder sneered, his golden wings fluttering as he gave chase.

“This kid is full of treasures!” The elder mused, his gaze greedy as he watched Luotian darting ahead.

Sword energy clashed; the elder materialized before Luotian, blocking his path: “Kid, you can’t run. Hand over that ding!”

“Get lost…” Luotian roared, unleashing Mist Destruction Fist toward the elder.

“Fruitless effort!” The elder scoffed, slicing through the gray mist. The energy still surged toward Luotian.

“Damn it!” Luotian’s face twisted with fury; a Soul-Realm Late Stage was beyond his reach. The sword energy struck him, sending him staggering back with a gash on his chest.

Ignoring the wound, Luotian’s feet propelled him forward, leaving a phantom behind.

“Hmph…” The elder’s face flickered with surprise at Luotian’s speed, his lips curling.

“Fengtian Step Fifth Stage!” Luotian’s eyes widened, recalling the near-instantaneous speed. He was elated.

At this moment, Luotian’s form exited the city governor’s mansion, entering Lishui City’s streets. No one remained; all had fled, fearing the mansion’s power.

“Not sure if that elder’s shop is still open…” Luotian murmured, sensing a sword energy slicing through the sky. He gritted his teeth and unleashed Fengtian Step Fifth Stage, vanishing from sight.

“Buzz…” Luotian’s form appeared three hundred zhang away from the shop he once inhabited, his face filled with anticipation.

“Kid… where are you running?” The elder’s voice echoed, his impatience growing. Luotian evaded him like a eel, frustrating the elder.

Due to his status, the elder could not linger long. His impatience grew; he transformed into a sword, his speed skyrocketing as he materialized before Luotian.

Luotian heard the elder’s voice and knew trouble was near. Ignoring his wounds from Fengtian Step, he kicked off the ground, activating the step again and vanishing.

Sword energy raged; the elder unleashed five Dragon-Slaying Sword Energies, as if connecting with heaven and earth. They chased Luotian’s phantom.

Luotian’s face bore urgency; his only hope was that the elder still resided in the inn. He needed time to hide there.

Feeling the approaching sword energy, Luotian gritted his teeth, spitting a drop of blood to amplify his Qi. His speed doubled, and he appeared in the inn’s courtyard with a roar: “Check-in!”

Luotian entered the inn and spotted the white-haired elder he had once known. The young attendant was absent.

Seeing the elder, Luotian felt relief—his suspicion that this man was a hidden elder had been correct.

The elder, upon seeing Luotian burst in, trembled and halted his escape, turning to face him. He was visibly terrified, unsure how to respond.

Luotian stood awkwardly; this elder was a master of the hidden arts, and he dared not address him rudely.

But the awkwardness lasted only a moment as Luotian sensed five powerful Qi presences approaching the inn. They were mere tens of zhang away.

“Idiot!” Luotian sneered, gazing at the elder with disdain. He waited for the elder’s move.

“End… end!” The elder’s face paled, his fear palpable as he clutched his head, muttering prayers.

“Acting… so convincing,” Luotian sighed internally, sitting on a chair.

“Ten zhang… eight zhang… five zhang…” The five Dragon-Slaying Sword Energies closed in, their proximity to the inn growing.

Chapter 433: The Elder of the Dong Clan

As Luotian’s awe faded, the sword energies were mere hairbreadth from striking the inn. A single scratch would obliterate it.

Luotian’s composure shattered; he prepared to flee, too terrified.

The innkeeper remained motionless, his head bowed as he chanted prayers.

“Damn it!” Luotian cursed, rushing toward the inn’s back wall to escape. He had no time for the elder and was testing him.

As he collided with the wall, the five sword energies were but a hairbreadth from striking.

“Buzz…” At that moment, a powerful Qi fluctuation spread across the inn, a pale blue barrier forming like a bubble. It enveloped the humble inn.

Though fragile, it repelled Luotian’s escape and absorbed the five sword energies. The energies vanished like pebbles in the sea, creating no ripples.

“Hmph…” The elder’s face turned pale with shock, his disbelief evident as he stared at the blue barrier. He felt an indescribable terror within the inn, hesitating to approach.

Meanwhile, in the Southern Domain, an elderly man resembling a drunkard lay sprawled in a corner, his hat covering his face.

He removed the hat, unfastened his gourd, and took a swig of wine. His eyes glinted with amusement: “It must be that troublemaker. I’m glad I left quickly—otherwise, I’d have been his free bodyguard again!”
