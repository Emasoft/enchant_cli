Gu Qianxue slowly approached Luo Tian and embraced his frail frame, her eyes brimming with profound reluctance.

Luo Tian extended his arms and gently pulled Gu Qianxue's slender body into his embrace.

At that moment, time seemed to halt; no one dared disturb the lovers' farewell.

Gu Yun had just been released by Shangguan Qingyu. He gazed at Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei, his face pale. As a father, he could not shield his children from the storm but instead used their futures to secure his family's survival. What could be more agonizing for a father than this?

Watching the two reluctant to part, Shangguan Fei's face finally showed impatience. He muttered, "Have you had enough? Stop dragging your feet!"

Hearing Shangguan Fei interrupt them, the Gu family's eyes burned with fury and helplessness. Trading Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei for their family's survival was an indelible disgrace.

Gu Qianxue softly wiped the tears from her eyes, her face returning to its icy demeanor as if she were a different person. "Take care of yourself."

She turned and addressed Gu Yun, "Father, take care of yourself."

Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei bowed deeply to Gu Yun, their faces filled with sorrow, before standing behind Shangguan Fei.

Seeing them obediently position themselves behind him, Shangguan Fei nodded in satisfaction and addressed the Gu family. "Rest assured; they are my junior relatives. I will take care of them in the Yellower Sect!"

"Go!" Shangguan Fei and his two companions, eyes filled with contempt, left the Gu family's presence under their fiery glares.

Luo Tian watched them depart, a cold killing intent swirling in his eyes. His fists clenched tightly, emitting a crisp sound. With the Refining Body Nine Stages, his body bled from the palm as he exerted himself.

At that moment, Luo Tian's heart felt dead; his eyes stared blankly at their retreating figures. He roared, "Power! Power! I need power!"

His eyes flickered with a faint crimson hue. However, Gu Yun swiftly noticed Luo Tian's abnormality and, with his last strength, struck Luo Tian's neck.

Luo Tian's already wounded body, under this force, rolled his eyes and fainted.

After expending his final strength, Gu Yun felt a tightness in his chest and spat blood onto the ground before collapsing unconscious.

As Luo Tian, Gu Yun, and Tiantai fell to the ground, the Gu family rushed to lift them and headed toward their ancestral home.

...

Night fell deep within the Dian'an Forest, a radiant beam of light piercing the sky. Dense spiritual energy radiated from the glow, nurturing nearby trees that grew at an astonishing rate. Beasts sensing this tangible spiritual energy howled wildly, rushing toward the light.

A horde of beasts, thousands in number, gathered like a tide beside the luminous barrier. Since the spiritual energy had rained down a year ago, scattered beasts had regrouped at the barrier's edge, growling.

"Great Dian'an Forest has a treasure appearing!" On Feiyun Mountain, the old tomb guardian's face lit up with divine light as he gazed at the beam piercing the sky.

Nan Gong Xiu had also noticed the changes in Dian'an Forest, his face alight with joy. This situation clearly indicated a rare treasure's emergence. As the closest sect to Dian'an Forest, Feiyun Sect would gain the greatest advantage.

At the same time, other sects in the Northern Region sensed Dian'an Forest's transformation. Even city lords from the secular world wore joyous expressions, watching the radiant beam and dispatching their subordinates to Dian'an Forest.

Yet in Tianyuan City's Gu family, they paid no heed to why the outside was so bright. All members of the Gu family anxiously watched the two lying on their beds.

These two were Luo Tian and Tiantai. Gu Yun had already regained consciousness on the way back.

As a family of alchemists, the Gu family naturally stored medicinal pills, far superior to common ones on the market.

Gu Yun had ordered the family's finest healing pills for them, but they showed no signs of waking. If one of them died, it would be a severe blow to the Gu family.

Luo Tian was relatively better; though severely injured, it wasn't fatal. The most worrying was Tiantai, who had improved after taking the pills but whose body was already beyond repair. It was like a drop of water in a bucket, and it would not be long before he passed away.

"A cough..." A soft cough echoed as Luo Tian, pale-faced, opened his eyes and gazed at Gu Yun and the anxious family members. He smiled bitterly.

"How long have I been unconscious?" Luo Tian asked softly.

"More than three days," Gu Yun sighed, marveling at the Five Elements Body's remarkable recovery ability while a hint of joy surfaced on his face.

Luo Tian slowly sat up, feeling no major issues with his body. His gaze swept to Tiantai's side.

He stood up, approached Tiantai, whose condition was dire, and extended his hand, channeling gentle wood-element spiritual energy through his consciousness into Tiantai's body.

Seeing Luo Tian examining Tiantai's injuries, the Gu family members dared not interrupt but waited silently.

After a while, Luo Tian opened his eyes, his face grave. He sighed softly.

Hearing Luo Tian's sigh, Gu Yun felt a bad premonition and asked, "How is it?"

"Very bad. His meridians are nearly all destroyed and clotted, preventing spiritual energy from flowing. It roams uncontrollably within his body. Tiantai's resilience is astonishing; an ordinary person would have already died. But it's just a matter of time!" Luo Tian sighed softly, recalling the "Ten Thousand Grasses and Herbs" tome to search for any rare herbs or treasures to resolve this crisis.

Chapter 122: Molding Body Pills ()

Chapter 122: Molding Body Pills

Hearing Luo Tian's somber words, the Gu family, including Gu Yun, wore expressions of despair. A normal person would have been crippled by such meridian damage;更何况 Tiantai had a pre-existing illness and reached the peak of bone-fragmentation through secret methods. Under these aftereffects, there was no hope of saving him.

Seeing the family's sorrowful faces and some members already weeping, recalling this kind old man who had tirelessly protected the Gu family's interests until his last moment, people felt a deep pang in their hearts.

"Is there any chance to save him? Even without cultivation, just save him!" Gu Yun cautiously asked, hoping for an answer from Luo Tian. Though he did not want to face reality, he still asked because he was the head of the Gu family and could not collapse or weep.

Luo Tian, who deeply respected this old man who had devoted his life to the Gu family, felt admiration. His mind flashed with nearly two million kinds of herbs and countless elixir formulas.

"Refining Body Pills!" Luo Tian's expression hardened as he uttered the name.

"Refining Body Pills?" Gu Yun repeated the name of this elixir, though his family was an alchemy sect and he considered himself familiar with many herbs and elixirs, he had never heard of this Refining Body Pills.

"Refining Body Pills," Luo Tian said solemnly, "rebuild meridians, restore the body. As long as there's a breath left, it can be restored to its prime state!"

Hearing Luo Tian's explanation, the Gu family members' faces lit up with joy. They had never imagined such a miraculous elixir existed, its effects bordering on the supernatural.

However, Luo Tian's next words were like cold water, dousing the Gu family's joy.

"Refining Body Pills are sixth-grade elixirs, requiring rare herbs like Dragon's Blood Essence, Thousand-Year Demon Heart Grass, and Blue Cloud Herb..." Luo Tian's face showed bitterness as he listed the required herbs.

The Gu family members had never heard of these herbs, but a sixth-grade alchemist was already enough to make them tremble. Even the Gu family could not afford a sixth-grade alchemist.

Luo Tian took out a bottle of his own healing elixir from his sleeve. Though he had given all the pills in his storage ring to Feiyun Sect, he had kept some for self-preservation.

He placed the elixir into Tiantai's mouth. The seven parts of herbal power in Tiantai's body were far superior to the Gu family's elixirs, and Tiantai's face regained some color. However, this was only a temporary fix.

"Think of ways to help him. I estimate Tiantai can last about a month. Try your best to find solutions within this month," Luo Tian sighed.

"A sixth-grade alchemist, our sect's Grand Elder is likely one. That shouldn't be a problem. But the issue of herbs is棘手. Although Five Elements Sect is the top sect in the Northern Region, it's impossible for them to have every herb!" Luo Tian sighed again.

"Yes, Five Elements Sect! The Five Elements Sect must have a solution!" The Gu family members' faces brightened again upon hearing Luo Tian mention the Five Elements Sect.

"I'll return to the Five Elements Sect in two days. After all, I need to inform the two峰 masters about Qianxue and Gu Lei's situation. Also, I'll try to gather as many herbs as possible. You all should also try your best to collect them, even if it means selling everything or resorting to any means within a month!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with cold determination.

In the past, Luo Tian would never have said words like "steal" or "plunder," but after these days' experiences, he knew this was a world of the strong devouring the weak. If one lacked strength and was killed, no one would pity them.

Seeing Luo Tian seemingly transformed into another person, Gu Yun's eyes showed bitterness. He did not know whether this change was good or bad for Luo Tian, and he softly replied, "Alright."

As the Gu family members prepared to continue discussing how to treat Tiantai, a disciple entered the room respectfully. He glanced at the gathered Gu family members and, upon seeing Luo Tian, his face showed a fervent expression. He whispered, "Lord of the family, Wang Pengtian from the Wang family has arrived and wishes to speak with you about something!"

Hearing the disciple's report, Gu Yun furrowed his brows. The Gu family was currently in a precarious situation; he did not know Wang Pengtian's purpose. However, recalling their long-standing friendly relations with the Wang family, he exchanged a glance with Luo Tian and strode out.

Behind Gu Yun, Luo Tian followed him toward the reception hall.

Upon entering the reception hall, they saw Wang Pengtian, dressed as a scholar, sipping tea. Behind him stood a young man with sharp eyes.

"Uncle Wang, what business do you have at my Gu family?" Before Gu Lei entered, his voice reached Wang Pengtian's ears.

Hearing Gu Yun's voice, Wang Pengtian quickly rose to greet him. He had always respected the Gu family; during the battle with the Li family, the Gu family's strength was beyond his Wang family's reach.

Wang Pengtian stood up and saw Luo Tian and Gu Yun approaching from outside. Upon seeing Luo Tian's figure, Wang Pengtian showed a brief surprise but quickly concealed it.

At that moment, Luo Tian's face was pale, and Gu Lei's complexion was not healthy. They entered the reception hall, where Gu Yun and Wang Pengtian exchanged a brief greeting.

Seeing Luo Tian and Gu Lei's grim faces, Wang Pengtian thought of the terrifying fluctuation in the sky over Tianyuan City the previous night and secretly speculated it was related to the Gu family.

"Uncle Luo, when did you return? Why didn't you inform me earlier? I would have come to welcome you!" Wang Pengtian smiled, elevating Luo Tian to an equal level.

But this statement made the young man behind Wang Pengtian frown tightly. This young man was Wang Pengtian's son, Wang Tianxiang, a disciple of the second-tier sect, Crazy Blade Sect. He had come to investigate Dian'an Forest's situation and returned home for a visit.

Hearing his father address this young man so politely, even on equal terms, Wang Tianxiang felt uncomfortable. If they were to be considered as brothers, then he would be this young man's nephew. Seeing this young man was younger than him, how could Wang Tianxiang feel at ease?

"Uncle Wang is too kind. It was my mistake not to visit earlier. Please don't take it personally!" Luo Tian, seeing Wang Pengtian's politeness, responded politely.

"Really? You're so full of yourself! Calling me uncle, and you dare to accept it!" Wang Tianxiang saw Luo Tian's boldness and smiled coldly.

In Wang Tianxiang's view, a mere disciple of the Tianyuan City family could not be worthy of his father addressing him as an equal.

However, hearing Wang Tianxiang's words, Wang Pengtian's face turned red, and even Gu Yun's expression changed.

Chapter 123: You Disagree? ()

Chapter 123: You Disagree?

Wang Tianxiang stepped forward with arrogance, his Refining Body Seven Stages power pressing toward Luo Tian and Gu Yun.

Hearing his son's words, Wang Pengtian's face turned red. He knew Luo Tian's terrifying strength; even when he was at Refining Body Four Stages, he had defeated Li Feihong at Refining Body Six. Over the past year, he doubted Luo Tian had made no progress.

Moreover, rumors said that the Gu family's two children and Luo Tian had all joined the Five Elements Sect. Thinking of the Five Elements Sect disciples seen in Tianyuan City recently and the news of nearly a thousand Feiyun Sect disciples dying, Wang Pengtian, who knew Luo Tian had a grudge with Li Xiuping, could easily guess this matter was related to the young man before him.

Seeing Wang Tianxiang press his power toward Luo Tian and Gu Yun, Wang Pengtian shouted, "Stop!"

Although Wang Pengtian had reached Refining Body Six after a year of training, he was clearly no match for his son. He wanted to intervene but could not stop Wang Tianxiang's pressure, which continued toward Luo Tian and Gu Yun.

Seeing Luo Tian's gradually darkening face, Wang Tianxiang secretly regretted not informing his son of Luo Tian's identity.

At that moment, Luo Tian was in a foul mood due to Chen Yunting and Gu Qianxue's matters, feeling an indescribable anger with nowhere to vent. Seeing Wang Pengtian's son dare to attack him, Luo Tian's lips curled in mockery but thought that since Wang Pengtian had helped him and the Gu family before, even if part of it was to prevent the Li family from encroaching on the Wang family, for Luo Tian this was help. So he closed his eyes and ignored it, letting the pressure pass over him.

Seeing Luo Tian easily block his power, Wang Tianxiang felt embarrassed and took two more steps forward. But Wang Pengtian, who had already succeeded once, would not let him do it again. He quickly stepped in front of Wang Tianxiang and blocked him.

"Get back!" Wang Pengtian shouted, raising his hand high and slapping Wang Tianxiang's face.

"Smack!" The crisp sound of the slap echoed! Wang Pengtian was truly angry, using a bit of his strength. Wang Tianxiang's face clearly bore five red handprints.

Wang Tianxiang was stunned by Wang Pengtian's slap. In his memory, Wang Pengtian had never truly hit him before; he only pretended to for outsiders.

"Here, it's not your place to speak! Get back!" Wang Pengtian glared at Wang Tianxiang and shouted again.

Wang Tianxiang saw his father's eyes signaling him, understanding immediately. Remembering today's purpose of coming to the Gu family, he muttered, "Yes!"

Seeing his son seemingly understand his eyes, Wang Pengtian smiled and said, "Sorry, my family education is poor. He left me early to learn arts and I didn't manage him well. Please don't take it personally, Uncle Luo!"

"Nothing's wrong! He's just a young man, full of youthful arrogance!" Luo Tian opened his eyes and spoke in an elder's tone.

This statement made Wang Tianxiang's face change again. He suppressed his anger and muttered, "Let you be so bold now; I'll show you when I get to Dian'an Forest!"

"Uncle Wang, what business do you have at my Gu family?" Gu Yun's face was dark, clearly不满 with Wang Tianxiang's actions.

Hearing Gu Yun's question, Wang Pengtian wore a serious expression and said softly, "Uncle Gu, did you notice the white light rising from Dian'an Forest yesterday?"

Hearing Wang Pengtian's words, Gu Yun nodded. Naturally, he knew about that white light; Tianyuan City was not far from Dian'an Forest. Not seeing it would make one blind. However, the Gu family had been preoccupied with Luo Tian and Tiantai's lives and hadn't cared about those things.

Luo Tian, hearing Wang Pengtian mention Dian'an Forest, felt his mind stir. Though Dian'an Forest was notorious for its dangers, it had countless herbs and opportunities. He had obtained the Epoch Book there himself. He thought of the few herbs needed to heal Tiantai, which were said to be in the northern part of Tianyuan Continent. It was highly likely they were in Dian'an Forest.

At the same time, Gu Yun also thought of this and exchanged a glance with Luo Tian, waiting for Wang Pengtian's next words.

"Rumors say that a precious treasure has emerged in Dian'an Forest. Now, all sects have mobilized to head toward Dian'an Forest. My son's second-tier sect, Crazy Blade Sect, arrived in Tianyuan City last night and plans to enter Dian'an Forest to investigate. They also asked me to contact the forces in Tianyuan City to help Crazy Blade Sect seize the treasure within the forest!" Wang Pengtian continued.

When Wang Pengtian mentioned Crazy Blade Sect, Wang Tianxiang's face showed a hint of pride. He looked at Luo Tian, obviously thinking that Luo Tian was just a family disciple and would be terrified upon hearing of Crazy Blade Sect.

But Wang Tianxiang saw Luo Tian's calm gaze, as if Crazy Blade Sect were just a common secular family. He inwardly sneered, "Rustic fellow, really rustic! Don't even know what a second-tier sect is!"

"So I came to the Gu family, hoping they would also help Crazy Blade Sect. In return, Crazy Blade Sect will surely not forget us!" Wang Pengtian continued softly, directly stating his intention.

Gu Yun's face showed contemplation, then he turned to Luo Tian, obviously hoping this matter would be decided by Luo Tian. After all, now the Gu family had no one else who could stand out besides himself. Given the current situation of the Gu family, he must stay here to stabilize their emotions.

"I'm sorry, Uncle Wang, our Gu family doesn't plan to get involved in this mess. This treasure's emergence is a big deal, but our Gu family is just a small clan. Compared to these sects, we can't afford it!" Luo Tian bowed respectfully and answered solemnly.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Wang Pengtian showed a hint of understanding. If it weren't for his son being in Crazy Blade Sect, he would also have declined this matter. However, since his son had already arrived, if they truly united the forces of Tianyuan City and helped Crazy Blade Sect, his son would gain a great achievement.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Wang Tianxiang was completely enraged. He hadn't expected Luo Tian and Gu Yun to be so ungrateful. Luo Tian didn't know about second-tier sects, but Gu Yun, as the head of the Gu family, couldn't have heard of Crazy Blade Sect. In his view, he had already lowered his pride to ask the Gu family, so they should have happily agreed.

Wang Tianxiang hadn't expected that Luo Tian first addressed his father as an equal, taking advantage of him. He had already忍 it, but now Luo Tian and Gu Yun were so ungrateful.

"Your meaning is that you disagree?" Wang Tianxiang could no longer hold back and asked coldly.

Chapter 124: Self-Inflicted Suffering ()

Chapter 124: Self-Inflicted Suffering

Wang Tianxiang's voice echoed again, asking Luo Tian and Gu Yun coldly without releasing his Refining Body Seven Stages power. He simply gazed at Luo Tian and Gu Yun with a cold expression, plunging the reception hall into silence again.

Luo Tian saw Wang Tianxiang's intent and coldly smiled, "How come we have to agree?"

"Hmph. Today you must agree, whether you want to or not. This matter isn't up to you. Becoming an affiliate of Crazy Blade Sect is already a great honor. How could you, these families, dare to argue?" Wang Tianxiang's face showed arrogance, a pride in his identity.

Not only Luo Tian but even Wang Pengtian felt displeased at Wang Tianxiang's words, his contempt for the family evident.

"Hmph. Then tell me, where did you come from without your Wang family? A traitor! Even if I cooperate with others, I won't partner with Crazy Blade Sect. Uncle Wang, today I give you face; if your son isn't sensible, I don't suggest he follows Li Feihong's fate!" Luo Tian finally lost his temper.

Luo Tian had reached the limit of his patience with Wang Tianxiang, but he had endured until now due to Wang Pengtian.

"Today I'll see what ability you have, making me follow Li Feihong's fate! Thinking defeating Li Feihong makes you arrogant? That Li Feihong isn't even worthy to tie your shoes! What's your name!"

"I'm Luo Tian!" Luo Tian coldly looked at Wang Tianxiang's provocation and said softly.

"Originally, you don't bear the Gu surname. The Gu family has Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei; have them come out. You're not worthy of my fight!" Wang Tianxiang, hearing Luo Tian's name, continued to shout with disdain.

"Boom..." The temperature in the air suddenly dropped. The teacup in Luo Tian's hand turned into white powder and fell to the ground.

Wang Pengtian saw his son's arrogance and his face turned red, wanting to stop him but it was too late. He shouted, "Stop!"

He rushed in front of Wang Tianxiang and raised his hand high to stop Wang Tianxiang's provocation.

However, as his hand fell, a figure like lightning appeared in front of Wang Tianxiang.

A fist with five colors struck Wang Tianxiang's chest.

"Crack..." The sound of broken bones echoed in the Gu family's reception hall.

Wang Tianxiang, about to continue his provocation, was forced back into his stomach. He spat blood and flew backward, crashing against the wall of the reception hall with a dull sound.

Wang Pengtian's hand hadn't fallen yet when he heard a gust of wind and felt a fierce aura pushing him away.

Luo Tian was completely furious; Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei's names were now his taboo. Anyone who insulted Gu Qianxue would pay a heavy price.

"You insult me, Luo Tian, I can overlook it, but you shouldn't have insulted Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei. Who insults them, dies!" Luo Tian didn't stop but approached Wang Tianxiang and coldly said, his voice filled with icy killing intent.

Wang Tianxiang was merely Refining Body Seven Stages, and although Luo Tian had been injured, he wasn't someone Wang Tianxiang could resist.

Luo Tian approached Wang Tianxiang and grabbed his neck, lifting him up.

Wang Tianxiang, lifted by Luo Tian, showed disbelief on his face. He hadn't expected this young man to be so terrifying; he had no chance to react before being subdued.

Wang Pengtian was also shocked, not expecting Luo Tian's strength to be so terrifying in a year. His aura alone made him unable to resist, and he was pushed away. His son's Refining Body Seven Stages had been subdued instantly.

"Luo, Luo Tian, show mercy!" Wang Pengtian heard Luo Tian's cold words and felt the intense killing intent. He immediately pleaded.

Seeing his old friend in such a pitiful state, Gu Yun sighed and walked up to Wang Pengtian, helping him up. He whispered, "Your son's mistake was insulting Gu Qianxue and Lei!"

"Uncle Gu, I have only one son. Please beg for mercy on my behalf!" Wang Pengtian's face showed a pleading expression as he said to Gu Yun.

"I'll try my best, but honestly, if it weren't for your plea, I might have killed him myself!" Gu Yun coldly replied.

"Uncle Luo, let him go. After all, Uncle Wang once helped us. For Uncle Wang's sake, at least spare his life!" Gu Yun said with a bitter smile.

Luo Tian heard Gu Yun's words and slowly loosened his grip on Wang Pengtian's neck, throwing Wang Tianxiang in front of Wang Pengtian.

Seeing that Wang Tianxiang had only broken a few bones and was otherwise fine, Wang Pengtian sighed in relief. His face showed gratitude: "Luo Tian, today I was wrong! Please don't hold it against me!"

Seeing Wang Pengtian's sincere apology, Luo Tian's eyes softened: "Today I give Uncle Wang a face. If he does this again, don't blame me for being ruthless!"

"Luo Tian, you're done. I am a core disciple of Crazy Blade Sect. You hit me, which equals hitting Crazy Blade Sect's face. Wait for Crazy Blade Sect's retaliation! Then not only you, but even the Gu family will be affected by your actions!" However, Wang Tianxiang did not accept the apology and brought up Crazy Blade Sect.

Hearing Wang Tianxiang mention Crazy Blade Sect, Luo Tian smiled coldly, and even Gu Yun chuckled.

"Oh? Then let Crazy Blade Sect send people to find me. Anyone at the Refining Body stage I will accept. Of course, if Crazy Blade Sect's people are shameless and bring up the Bone-Fragmentation stage, I won't mind Crazy Blade Sect becoming the next Feiyun Sect!" Luo Tian's face showed indifference as he said softly.

"Ah!
Hearing Luo Tian mention Feiyun Sect, Wang Pengtian, so intelligent, had already guessed that Feiyun Sect's incident was related to Luo Tian. But upon hearing Luo Tian confirm it, he still took a deep breath.

Wang Tianxiang had also heard of Feiyun Sect's incident. At this moment, even if he was dull, he understood Luo Tian's meaning and stared at him in shock. How could he have imagined that the deaths of nearly a thousand Feiyun Sect disciples were all related to this pale-faced Luo Tian?

For Feiyun Sect, Wang Tianxiang knew it was a top-tier sect. Although Crazy Blade Sect was also a second-tier sect, it was much weaker than Feiyun Sect. And this young man had done such a big thing to Feiyun Sect and was still alive, so his background must be terrifying.

Chapter 125: Uncle? ()

Wang Tianxiang suddenly remembered something, the legend of Feiyun Sect's tragedy. It was said that the incident was done by a genius of Five Elements Sect, with a five-element body. Wang Tianxiang suddenly realized that the fist Luo Tian had used to strike him was five-colored spiritual energy.

He trembled again, unable to speak, as he stared at Luo Tian. How could a disciple of Crazy Blade Sect dare to oppress a disciple of Five Elements Sect?

Five Elements Sect could send any peak master, and Crazy Blade Sect would be unable to withstand it. Thinking of this, Wang Tianxiang's face broke out in cold sweat. His arrogance vanished, and he stared at Luo Tian with trembling eyes.

"Go! Be careful in the future. Crazy Blade Sect is not a powerful sect! Don't be so arrogant and overbearing again in the future. This is my advice!" Luo Tian gazed deeply at Wang Tianxiang and said softly.

"Yes!" Wang Tianxiang, feeling ashamed, lowered his head. He wasn't stupid; Luo Tian's talent and identity were so low-key. How could he, a disciple of Crazy Blade Sect, be so arrogant? If it were anyone else today, he might not have just been injured.

Seeing his son's change of heart, Wang Pengtian wore a satisfied expression and looked at Luo Tian with gratitude. He knew that Luo Tian's punishment had removed Wang Tianxiang's arrogance, and although he was injured, Wang Pengtian had no complaints.

"Luo brother, today I owe you a favor!" Wang Pengtian bowed to Luo Tian and helped the injured Wang Tianxiang out of the Gu family's main gate.

Before leaving, Wang Tianxiang reminded Luo Tian: "Today you refused my proposal, but Crazy Blade Sect has more than just me. I'm sure many disciples will come to persuade the Gu family in the future. I believe other sects will do the same! Uncle Luo, be careful!"

Hearing Wang Tianxiang call him "Uncle Luo," Gu Yun's face showed a strange expression, looking at Wang Pengtian and Luo Tian.

Wang Pengtian hit Wang Tianxiang's head again, scolding: "You little bastard, still trying to take advantage of your father. You call Luo Tian 'uncle,' but what about me, your father!"

"What if I don't call him uncle?" Wang Tianxiang's face showed委屈, his heart troubled. It was hard for him to call someone two years younger than himself "uncle."

"Don't you dare! What if I don't call him uncle?" Wang Pengtian hit Wang Tianxiang's head again.

"Call it or not!"

Luo Tian and Gu Yun were speechless watching this lively father-son duo, both smiling lightly.

"Uncle!" Finally, under Wang Pengtian's pressure and persuasion, Wang Tianxiang, face red, squeezed out the two words from his teeth.

"Yes, that's good!" Wang Pengtian smiled in satisfaction and turned to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian saw Wang Pengtian's gaze and knew his intention. He pointed at Wang Pengtian, shaking his head with a bitter smile: "I'm really scared of you!"

He sighed deeply and took out two jade bottles from his sleeve. Now, Luo Tian's pills were truly scarce.

"Take them!" Luo Tian handed the bottles to Wang Tianxiang.

"Now take one, and save the rest for when you're about to break through Bone-Fragmentation. Consider it a gift!" Luo Tian said with a bitter smile to Wang Tianxiang.

Wang Pengtian smiled like a fox.

Wang Tianxiang held the bottles, thinking to himself: "It's just two pills. Why did my father let his son lower a generation?"

Reluctantly, he opened the bottles and smelled a faint fragrance.

"These pills really smell good! The Gu family truly is an alchemy family. Even our Crazy Blade Sect's alchemists rarely make such high-level pills!" Wang Tianxiang sighed slightly and took a healing pill.

The pill entered his mouth, and his face immediately changed. His eyes showed disbelief as he looked at Luo Tian but couldn't speak. The powerful medicinal energy had already spread throughout his body.

"What kind of pills are these? Why do they feel so much stronger than the ones our sect's alchemists make?" Wang Tianxiang was shocked and began to refine the medicinal energy.

Wang Pengtian watched his son refining the pills with curiosity.

Under Wang Pengtian's shocked gaze, Wang Tianxiang's wounds healed at an astonishing rate. In a moment, they were completely healed. However, Wang Tianxiang didn't open his eyes.

After a while, Wang Tianxiang suddenly opened his eyes, sweeping the surrounding spiritual energy away. His body exuded the aura of Refining Body Eight Stages, his face showing joy.

Wang Tianxiang hadn't expected that just one pill could let him break through. Although he knew he was at the edge of breaking through, it would take two months to break through Refining Body Eight Stages. But one pill had saved him two months of hard training. How could he not be excited?

Now, it was the time to head for Dian'an Forest. Dian'an Forest was notorious for its dangers, but now having more strength meant more protection. This made Wang Tianxiang unable to help being excited.

"Uncle! My dear uncle!" Wang Tianxiang shouted, looking at this man who was only a couple of years younger.

Seeing Wang Tianxiang's natural call after being unwilling to call him uncle before, Wang Pengtian suddenly felt that making Wang Tianxiang call Luo Tian "uncle" was not a correct decision. It was too shameless. Wang Pengtian saw how quickly Wang Tianxiang's face changed and felt a bit helpless, patting his forehead.

Luo Tian and Gu Yun were also shocked by Wang Tianxiang's affectionate behavior, as he was completely different from his previous demeanor.

"Uncle, are there more of these pills? Give me some more!" Wang Tianxiang, as if addicted to calling him uncle, asked Luo Tian again, forgetting the previous unpleasantness.

"None left!" Luo Tian's skin was covered in goosebumps, his lips curling.

"Little bastard, go back and get lost!" Wang Pengtian saw Wang Tianxiang had recovered and without hesitation kicked him out of the Gu family's main gate.

Chapter 126: The Strongest Refining Body ()

Tianyuan City, Gu family.

After that day, Luo Tian and Gu Yun stood in the courtyard where he had previously lived, beginning a frenzied alchemy process. They had decided to enter Dian'an Forest first to try their luck, as the treasure's emergence was well-known. The Five Elements Sect would certainly know and send people. Luo Tian decided to wait for the Five Elements Sect's arrival again, then go together to Dian'an Forest. This would increase their chances.
