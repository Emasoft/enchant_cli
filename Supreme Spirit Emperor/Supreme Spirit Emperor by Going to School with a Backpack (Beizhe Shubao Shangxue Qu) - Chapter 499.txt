“Just what kind of monster is this? Last time it devoured demon seeds, and now it's devouring Jiang Taibai’s wine—it's utterly abnormal!” Luo Tian grew even more curious about the sparrow’s identity.

When Luo Tian was intrigued, outside the scene erupted in shock, watching as Luo Tian continued to drink heavily without pause.

“Eighteen breaths…”
“This kid can endure so long!” The group’s eyes were filled with astonishment, especially Jiang Taibai, who hadn’t expected Luo Tian to hold out for so long.

“Truly remarkable—no wonder he’s the descendant of Gu Tian.” Jiang Taibai nodded, his gaze revealing surprise.

“Senior, if you keep doing this, I won’t drink anymore!” Luo Tian’s eyes turned red; he hadn’t expected the sparrow to be so insatiable.

“Kid, if you dare to let go, I’ll kill you! If I wanted to end you, even that man outside couldn’t save you!” The sparrow shouted threats.

“This kid’s eyes are red—he must be near his limit! It’s already twenty-three breaths!” The group murmured softly.

“Senior, you’re a supreme sage; your might is unmatched. Please show some mercy and give me a little! Once my strength rises, I can properly cultivate the Beast Taming Seal!” Luo Tian surrendered, pleading with desperate words.

“Senior, I’ve always respected you; my reverence for you is like the endless river…”
“Senior…” Luo Tian kept speaking, spouting flattery.

“Stop… I’ll give you some! Just shut up!” The sparrow finally relented, and a single drop of wine fell into Luo Tian’s mouth.

“One… two…” Drops trickled into his mouth, and though it was just a few drops, Luo Tian felt satisfied. Too much would’ve been unbearable; this slow drip reduced his suffering significantly.

“Sixty breaths!” As Luo Tian began refining the wine, the crowd outside erupted in chaos.

“My heavens! What kind of monster is this? He’s endured so long!” Jiang Taibai’s eyes widened in disbelief.

“No wonder he’s the ‘Sky-Devouring’—he’s endured this long!” Ye Liangchen laughed, his voice laced with pride.

“This kid is truly…” Jiang Taibai shook his head, believing Luo Tian wouldn’t last long.

“Gulp… Gulp…” Everyone remained calm, counting the time for Luo Tian to see how long he could endure.

Time passed slowly until a incense-burning period had elapsed, yet Luo Tian still hadn’t stopped.

“Monstrous! Doesn’t he fear bursting?” The group stared wide-eyed, watching Luo Tian guzzle wine.

Jiang Taibai’s lips twitched; his expression changed, watching Luo Tian refuse to put down the wine flask.

“Pleasant…” At that moment, Luo Tian’s mind held only one word: his golden-black immortal pill in the dantian radiated a steady aura, growing gradually.

Another tea-brewing period passed; except for Jiang Taibai, the others had grown numb.

Jiang Taibai’s face darkened; his forehead broke out in sweat, his heart feeling like it was bleeding. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to drink so much without pause.

At that moment, Jiang Taibai regretted his actions—regretted meddling and letting Luo Tian drink his wine. He longed to snatch the flask back but knew that would invite mockery.

“He won’t last much longer! He won’t last much longer!” Jiang Taibai repeatedly reassured himself, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

Yet after a quarter-hour, Luo Tian still hadn’t stopped; the dantian roared endlessly.

Jiang Taibai was nearly crying, his gaze shifting to Jiang Huatian, who he mentally communicated with. Now he understood: this kid had no limits; if not stopped, he’d drain the flask entirely.

Seeing Jiang Taibai’s twisted face, Jiang Huatian didn’t need to be told what he meant. He coughed lightly and approached Luo Tian: “Kid, do you want to drink yourself to death?”

“Almost enough…” Luo Tian muttered internally, glancing at Jiang Taibai, feeling it was about time.

“Kid, don’t stop—keep going! If you stop, I’ll kill you!” The sparrow’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, making his face grimace.

“Kid, if you keep drinking, I’ll kill you!” Seeing Luo Tian’s lack of movement, Jiang Taibai finally couldn’t hold back and mentally communicated with him, deepening Luo Tian’s grimace.

“Damn it! I’ve messed up both sides!” Luo Tian cursed internally.

“You and that old man, ‘Heaven and Earth’s Primordial Sect, the Root of Ten Thousand Qi, Broad Cultivation Through Eons, Forging My Divine Powers…’”

“Old man heard that and wouldn’t stop you!” The sparrow sneered, mentally transmitting the words to Luo Tian.

“Really?” Luo Tian doubted it; his life depended on this, so he couldn’t be careless.

“Let you—just do it!” The sparrow finished speaking and said no more, resuming its devouring.

“‘Heaven and Earth’s Primordial Sect…’” Luo Tian chose to trust the sparrow, gritting his teeth and mentally transmitting to Jiang Taibai.

“Hmph?” Jiang Taibai heard the transmission, his brows furrowed before his eyes flashed with radiant light, drawing everyone’s attention.

“Kid, haven’t you had enough?” Jiang Huatian saw Jiang Taibai’s gaze and thought he was furious, also feeling Luo Tian had been disrespectful. He raised his hand to strike Luo Tian.

“Stop!” Jiang Taibai extended a hand, golden light flashing as he halted Jiang Huatian. He gazed deeply at Luo Tian: “This wine is yours!”

“Truly, ‘Broad Cultivation Through Eons, Forging My Divine Powers!’” Jiang Taibai laughed aloud, took out another wine flask, drank deeply, then soared into the sky, leaving with a carefree demeanor.

“What’s going on?” The crowd looked puzzled, unsure why Jiang Taibai suddenly left and gifted his beloved wine flask to Luo Tian.

“Envy!” Everyone’s hearts were filled with envy; the value of that flask was immeasurable.

Time passed slowly, and after half an hour, Luo Tian drank the last drop into his mouth, his face showing admiration.

“Crack…” Faint cracks rose from Luo Tian’s golden-black immortal pill, as if it might shatter at any moment.

“Dao Marks—three marks mean the peak of a celestial immortal; nine marks signify a step toward true immortality! If fully cracked, it’s the beginning of true immortality!” Luo Tian muttered internally, his voice filled with excitement. If he had cultivated alone, it would’ve taken years to form a single Dao Mark!

“Sky-Devouring, you truly are my Sky-Devouring! You’ve drunk so much!” Ye Liangchen shouted, pulling Luo Tian back.

Chapter 1925: A Major Change in the Dragon City ()

“Luo Tian, from today on, Fan Tian Island is always open to you. If any trouble arises that you can’t resolve, come to Fan Tian Island and find me!” Jiang Huatian addressed Luo Tian.

If before Jiang Huatian had been polite due to Jiang Yuzhe, now his politeness stemmed from Jiang Taibai.

Moreover, Jiang Huatian’s attitude was even more courteous; he knew Jiang Yuzhe’s status was high, but it paled in comparison to Jiang Taibai.

“Sky-Devouring, what’s your plan next? Come back with us to Star River Prefecture; I’ll ensure you eat well and drink richly!” After the group’s shock, Ye Liangchen addressed Luo Tian.

“No, brother, let’s part ways here. I need to return to the Heavenly Dragon Sect!” Luo Tian replied to Ye Liangchen, his voice laced with a smile. Chen Zhanbiao and Xuan Dan were still in the Heavenly Dragon Sect; how could Luo Tian not return?

“Heavenly Dragon Sect disciple?” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the three sect elders finally noticed his tattered Heavenly Dragon Sect attire.

“Haha! No wonder you’re the sect’s genius—kid, I’m Zang Yunfei; the next sect leader will be yours!” A senior shouted, his voice filled with joy.

“Luo Tian, join our Earth Dragon Sect! We’re better than theirs; in the Heavenly War, we’ll surely break into the Middle Heavens and establish a foothold!” Another elder spoke confidently.

“Still, my Iron Dragon Sect is better! Those two old men are all heartless!” The Iron Dragon Sect elder also spoke loudly, his voice laced with disdain.

“Rubbish! All of you Iron Dragon Sect are just sticks!” Hearing the Iron Dragon Sect elder’s words, the Heavenly and Earth Dragon Sect elders immediately retaliated.

“Again! Outstanding people are always so dazzling!” Luo Tian muttered quietly, but his eyes flickered.

“Haha! Truly amusing—do you think a late-stage celestial immortal can compete in the Heavenly War?” Ye Liangchen laughed at the three elders’ quarrel.

“Sky-Devouring, just come with me to Star River Prefecture; they have no chance at all!” Ye Liangchen shook his head, knowing the brutal nature of the Heavenly War. He feared Luo Tian might face misfortune.

Moreover, Ye Liangchen knew that none of the three lower-heaven sects could match Guanyuan Sect. Even if Guanyuan Sect had been devastated by an immortal sage, it still wasn’t a late-stage celestial immortal with several early-stage ones.

“…”

Hearing Ye Liangchen’s unhidden mockery, the three elders’ faces darkened. Though his words were hurtful, they knew Ye Liangchen was absolutely right. As a Star River Prefecture resident, he understood Guanyuan Sect’s current strength better than them.

“Enough! No matter how you argue, Luo Tian is my brother. If anything happens to him, no matter which sect enters the Middle Heavens, they’ll face annihilation!” Ye Liangchen shouted.

“Luo Tian哥哥…” As Luo Tian and the others conversed, Long Youran’s group called out. They hadn’t left yet.

“Liangchen, how did it go?” A dozen aristocrats wore expressions of lingering fear as they addressed Ye Liangchen. They had only felt the battle’s fluctuations, and even that was enough to shake their minds.

“Nothing serious; after all, I’m a great genius—nothing is beyond my control! Haha!” Ye Liangchen glanced at Long Youran, approached Luo Tian, and pulled Zheng Tiande to Long Youran’s side.

“Long Youran, this is the person you were looking for, right? I and Sky-Devouring saved him!” Ye Liangchen addressed Long Youran, handing Zheng Tiande to her. His hand discreetly touched hers.

“Thank you!” Long Youran’s face lit up with joy, but she soon noticed Zheng Tiande’s cultivation level, her expression slightly changing.

“Surviving is already a miracle!” Zheng Tiande patted Long Youran’s head, his face showing a kind smile.

“Alright, everything is resolved. I’m leaving!”

“Would you like to come back with me?” Jiang Huatian shouted, his gaze shifting toward Ye Liangchen and the others. The Heavenly War meant nothing to him.

“Then we’ll go with you, Master Jiang!” Ye Liangchen nodded lightly; he needed to return Star River Prefecture.

“Luo Tian, Long Youran, take care! Don’t bother with the Heavenly War—just leave!” Ye Liangchen bid farewell to Luo Tian and Long Youran, then led a group with Jiang Huatian toward Fan Tian Island.

“Long Youran, go back to Long Yin City with Zheng Tiande and tell your father the crisis has been resolved. From now on, there’s no more Endless Forest!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, gazing at the howling moon heavenly wolves, unsure of what to do with them.

“Okay!” Long Youran nodded and led Zheng Tiande toward Long Yin City. The sky was left with only Luo Tian and the three sect elders.

“Kid, come with me back to the Heavenly Dragon Sect!” The Heavenly Dragon Sect elder smiled and addressed Luo Tian.

“Elders, I have something to say—do you think it’s appropriate?” Luo Tian’s gaze flickered as he looked at the three old men. Now, he wasn’t afraid of them; with Fan Tian Island behind him, they wouldn’t dare touch him.

“Speak freely!” The three elders smiled warmly, their gazes on Luo Tian, making him feel a layer of goosebumps.

“If you wish to win the Heavenly War, there’s only one path—unification. Other sects are just chickens and dogs, unworthy of great use!” Luo Tian spoke softly, causing the three elders to pause.

“I am a Heavenly Dragon Sect disciple and will return there. However, if the Heavenly War fails, I’ll enter the Middle Heavens alone!” Luo Tian spoke softly. Though joining Star River Prefecture would mean starting from scratch, if the three sects didn’t unite, they couldn’t establish a foothold in the Middle Heavens.

Luo Tian finished speaking and ignored the three sect elders’ choices; it was their decision.

“Indeed, that’s true!” The Heavenly Dragon Sect elder spoke, exchanging glances with the other two.

“This matter needs further research!” The Earth Dragon Sect elder’s face was solemn; they knew unification was good, but it was too complex or perhaps impossible.

“Perhaps this kid is a turning point! But whether he can withstand it remains to be seen!” The Earth Dragon Sect elder smiled, his eyes flashing with sharpness.

Luo Tian flew back to Long Yin City and immediately saw several figures in his view, their eyes filled with gratitude.

“Crash… Crash…” Seeing Luo Tian return, Long Li, Sun Luoshan, and Zhang Wangfeng led the way, kneeling before Luo Tian.

Behind them stood ten thousand elite soldiers from the Five Great Cities, also kneeling in unison, their voices roaring like waves.

“Luo Tian…” A deep roar echoed, its sound piercing the sky, shaking the heavens and earth, making Luo Tian slightly startled.

“Uncle, what are you doing?” Luo Tian’s face shifted slightly as he rushed to Long Li’s side and helped him up.

“Luo Tian, if it weren’t for you, my Five Great Cities might have been destroyed. Dozens of thousands of residents from the Five Great Cities might’ve been killed!”

“You deserve this bow!” Long Li shouted, his voice filled with deep gratitude.

“Senior, it’s nothing; let them get up! Senior, you’re killing me!” Luo Tian quickly spoke.

“Everyone, rise!” Long Li smiled and addressed the crowd behind him. The ten thousand people stood up in an instant.

“Uncle, I’m returning to the Heavenly Dragon Sect; let Long Youran stay with you for a few days!” Luo Tian addressed Long Li. He wanted to know the current state of the Heavenly Dragon Sect.

“Hmph, since you have important matters, I won’t keep you!” Long Li nodded. They were no longer on the same level as Luo Tian.

“Then, Uncle, we’ll meet again later. If anything happens, just find me!” Luo Tian took out his identity token and gave Long Li a piece.

Afterward, he instructed Long Li on how to handle the group of howling moon heavenly wolves. After all, so many of them were a terrifying force!

“Designate the former Endless Forest area for planting trees and medicinal herbs. That’s where the howling moon heavenly wolves belong!”

“On one hand, it allows the howling moon heavenly wolves to protect the herbs; on another, it prevents ghosts from escaping through the seal, giving the Five Great Cities time to prepare!” Luo Tian spoke softly. Then he mounted the howling moon heavenly wolf king’s back, flying toward the Heavenly Dragon Sect under the people of the Five Great Cities’ reverent gazes.

“Alright, everyone go home and prepare for work! These howling moon heavenly wolves won’t attack us anymore!” Long Li sighed deeply and addressed the crowd.

Seven days passed in a blink, and Luo Tian sat on the howling moon heavenly wolf king’s back, returning to the outskirts of Dragon City. Once he flew over Dragon City, he would return to the Heavenly Dragon Sect.

As he flew over Dragon City’s sky, Luo Tian wore a slight smile, suddenly thinking of one person—Long Zaitian. He extended his spiritual sense to check how Long Zaitian had been doing these days.

“Buzz…” His vast spiritual sense spread out, instantly covering a quarter of Dragon City.

The entire Dragon City remained harmonious, but when Luo Tian’s gaze fell on the city governor’s mansion, his face slightly changed.

Inside the grand hall of the city governor’s mansion, several figures sat in the main seat: Long Zaitian sat on the governor’s throne, but his eyes were lifeless.

On either side of Long Zaitian stood two men: one bare-chested with scars all over, the other with eyes filled with malevolence.

“Governor, the Zhao family of Dragon City has dared to provoke the governor’s authority; I suggest exterminating them!” The man beside Long Zaitian spoke, his voice devoid of any respect.

“Governor, please issue the order to exterminate them!” Others in the hall also stood up, except for a few who remained seated, their faces grim.

“You…!” Long Zaitian looked at them, his face dark as if about to drip water.

A while ago, a large group arrived in Dragon City with Xuandan’s personal letter, requesting to reside there.

Xuandan’s personal letter was something Long Zaitian couldn’t ignore; he had accommodated them all, providing good food and drink. Moreover, these people were powerful, so Long Zaitian had taken pity on them, assigning them to Dragon City.

At first, they were well-behaved, but as time passed, they became overbearing, gradually usurping Long Zaitian’s loyalists.

“Governor, your words make us feel disheartened!” The middle-aged man beside Long Zaitian smiled slightly, patting Long Zaitian’s shoulder.

“When did Dragon City become your domain?” As Long Zaitian’s face darkened, a cold voice echoed through the hall. A white-cloaked Luo Tian stepped into the hall, his icy aura instantly causing the people in the hall to hesitate.

“Daring… who dares to cause trouble in Dragon City? Do you think you’re challenging the Heavenly Dragon Sect…?” Hearing Luo Tian’s rebuke, many people turned and shouted at him. However, before their words finished, they fell silent.

“Luo Tian!” The people in the hall recognized Luo Tian. They had heard of his name when he and Xuandan arrived in Dragon City from Fan Tian Island.

“A bunch of ungrateful people!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly, walking slowly through the hall. His steps were slow, and his face was dark as if about to drip water.

He had sent these people to seek refuge in Dragon City, thinking they were a powerful force. But he hadn’t expected them to be so bold—instead of being grateful, they had overpowered Long Zaitian.

“Benefactor!” Seeing Luo Tian, Long Zaitian’s face showed excitement but quickly turned to shame.

“This is my fault for not being grateful!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly, approaching Long Zaitian. He glanced at the two men standing beside him.

“Get down!” Luo Tian’s cold voice made the two men shudder.

“You were personally selected by Master Xuandan to enter Dragon City!” The man with malevolent eyes looked anxious.

“Buzz…” Before the man’s words had finished, a golden hand materialized from above the hall and smashed into his body.

“Boom…” The man had no time to react, instantly turning into a mist of blood that splattered onto Luo Tian and Long Zaitian and the other man.

“Late-stage celestial immortal!” The people in the hall fell silent upon sensing Luo Tian’s cultivation. They remembered that when he was on Fan Tian Island, his cultivation had only been mid-stage celestial immortal. How long had it taken for him to reach late-stage?

“If it weren’t for me, would you be so carefree in Dragon City?”

“I hadn’t expected you to dare challenge Dragon City!” Luo Tian spoke coldly, scanning the people in the hall.

“Get down!” Luo Tian addressed the man who had stood there, making him tremble violently.

The man was terrified; seeing Luo Tian’s gaze, he knew that if he spoke, he would die.

“Die!” But Luo Tian didn’t give him a chance and struck again, the man’s scream echoing as he followed the other’s fate.

“Is there anyone who dares defy your authority?” Luo Tian addressed Long Zaitian, whose eyes were filled with excitement.

“This…!” Long Zaitian hesitated, scanning the people in the hall.

“He…” Long Zaitian pointed with his hand toward a middle-aged man wearing blue clothes in the crowd.

“Boom…” A golden hand descended, blood mist erupting among the crowd. Blood splattered everywhere, some even landing on people’s faces, making the hall’s people pale.

“This is a killer who doesn’t ask for reasons and kills without hesitation!” The crowd trembled, recalling what they had done to Long Zaitian. Many felt guilty and lowered their heads.

Some people’s faces showed relief, relieved they hadn’t participated in overpowered Long Zaitian.

“Is there another?” Long Zaitian kept pointing, and with each finger movement, more blood mist rose.

Within a quarter-hour, ten people were killed by Luo Tian’s hands; Long Zaitian stopped pointing.

The hall was filled with a bloodstained aroma, and the remaining twenty people trembled in place. Their eyes looked at Luo Tian with fear.

“Are there no more?” Luo Tian addressed Long Zaitian, inwardly praising him. He knew there were definitely others, but Long Zaitian hadn’t killed them all.

“Hmph, no more!” Long Zaitian nodded, gazing at the remaining twenty people. The twenty trembled.

“I hope you handle it yourself next time! Strength is the fundamental!” Luo Tian addressed Long Zaitian.

“Also, you—this time I’ll let it slide for Long Zaitian’s sake. I brought you to Dragon City not to be masters!”

“This city has only one governor—Long Zaitian. If you don’t want to stay in Dragon City, you can leave anytime and return to Fan Tian Island!” Luo Tian turned his back on the remaining twenty people.

“Yes, yes…” The twenty people trembled and nodded immediately, almost kneeling.

“I’ll help you three more times!” Luo Tian addressed Long Zaitian and stepped out of the hall.

“Heavenly Dragon Sect disciples, listen! From today on, our sect’s next leader is the genius disciple Luo Tian. From now on, Luo Tian shall be the Young Sect Leader. When the current sect leader has ruled for two hundred years, Luo Tian shall become the sect master!” A solemn voice echoed across Heavenly Dragon Sect, spreading throughout.

“What?” The people in the hall were stunned, gazing at Luo Tian who was also dazed. Their eyes showed disbelief.

“This… this…” The twenty people’s eyes completely changed; some still had the will to fight, but it was extinguished.

Within Heavenly Dragon Sect, all peak masters were shocked, their faces filled with disbelief. This voice was familiar to them—it was the Patriarch Zang Yunfei of Heavenly Dragon Sect.

“Why would the Patriarch not interfere with sect matters and just suddenly do this without even a greeting!” Several peak elders’ faces were also shocked.

The entire Heavenly Dragon Sect was in uproar; every disciple and elder looked bewildered, never expecting Luo Tian to become the Young Sect Leader so quickly.

“What’s going on!”
“Isn’t it supposed to be a competition for sect master before becoming one?” The disciples began murmuring.

“Luo Tian has become the next sect master!” On He Feng, Zuo Qiu Ming stood up abruptly, his eyes filled with complexity.

“I don’t accept it!”
“If Li Changfeng were the next sect master, I’d be satisfied. Even if it was Zuo Qiu Ming or any of the eight elders, I’d accept it. But what is Luo Tian? Why should he be our sect master!” Other peak elders all roared internally.

A while ago, Xuandan had returned alone from the Middle Heavens; those who went there were all annihilated. Three peak elders and three elders remained, with only Luo Tian and Xuandan left.

Li Changfeng and Duan Chengfeng had died, leaving only four of the eight elders. This made the remaining few elders reconsider their ambitions.

But no one expected Luo Tian to appear out of nowhere, a person who was supposedly impossible, yet the Patriarch had personally selected him as the next sect master.

“This kid!” On Dan Feng, Xuandan smiled, standing on a peak with a strong figure behind him.

“Big brother, big brother, when did you return!” Chen Zhanbiao spoke in a deep voice, his aura unusually intense.

“Who dares defy my big brother, I’ll kill them!” Chen Zhanbiao spoke fiercely, his voice laced with madness.

“Becoming sect master is good!”
“But there must be those who don’t accept it. Zhanbiao, first clear the obstacles for my big brother!” Xuandan smiled and addressed Chen Zhanbiao.

“If there are those who don’t accept it, they can challenge Luo Tian. If they defeat Luo Tian, the matter will be settled!” Xuandan’s words had just finished when the Patriarch of Dragon City echoed again.

“Ah, I see!” Upon hearing the Patriarch’s words, Heavenly Dragon Sect disciples and elders felt slightly better.

“One kid isn’t worthy of being our sect master!” Several peak masters stood up, their eyes cold.

“Who dares defy me? I’ll kill them!” A bold voice echoed, making the Heavenly Dragon Sect people surprised. They didn’t know who spoke.

“Three old men, truly ruthless! Using me as a means!” Luo Tian stood in Dragon City, his gaze thoughtful before a smile appeared.

“If so, I’ll be used once! Be their killing sword!” Luo Tian’s body shimmered, and he soared into the sky toward Heavenly Dragon Sect.

Meanwhile, almost at the same time, in the Earth Dragon Sect and Iron Dragon Sect, their patriarchs’ voices also echoed.

Chapter 1927: The True Master Has Returned ()

Dan Feng of the Dragon Sect
It had been a long time since anything happened at Dan Feng, but now it echoed with thunderous sounds. The usual Dan Competition platform was transformed into a combat arena.

“Boom!” A robust figure hurled a peak disciple off the platform.
“Who’s next?” The deep voice echoed, and the robust figure stood on the platform, his eyes fierce as he gazed at those below. The sheer pressure from his body was more than double the normal strength, and even more so with his late-stage celestial immortal aura.

“This eighth one!” The crowd murmured, gazing at the figure standing there.
“Even stronger than the previous ones!” They whispered among themselves, their eyes on the figure.

The crowd had long been focused on Dan Feng, and now it naturally became the center of all combat.

“Wow! So strong! A late-stage celestial immortal—Luo brother never mentioned this before. Perhaps only the Dragon Ranking could match him!”
“Unfortunately, Cen Xiong was already at late-stage celestial immortal. Ruan Xinghe and Zhu Fenghuo, Zhao Ri, but they were annihilated. If they were alive, they could have competed with him!” They whispered among themselves.

Half an hour passed, and the robust figure had defeated eight opponents. These eight were all renowned names in the Dragon Sect, ranking fifth to tenth on the list. Yet none had changed their fate; they were thrown down after a short struggle.

“I feel like Luo brother is even stronger than Luo!” They had never seen Luo’s true strength before and knew he hadn’t fought against Ruan Xinghe or Zhu Fenghuo. The Dragon Sect’s pride had been given to Luo, but now it was clear that this kid was truly a threat.

“Kid, what are you boasting about? You’ve never had peace since Luo came!” A senior elder stepped forward, his face dark and angry.

The crowd erupted in murmurs as they looked at the elder.
“Peak Master Li!” The disciples of the Dragon Sect gasped, realizing that the next sect master would be chosen among the eight elders. But Luo’s sudden intrusion made it hard for the elders to accept.

“Huh? A senior elder?” The crowd stared at Li, who hadn’t shown any respect for him.

“He should be able to handle it! This kid is strong, but he’s still an elder. Although he’s at late-stage celestial immortal, the peak elders should be stronger than this kid!” The disciples whispered.

“Kid, die! Since Luo came, we’ve never had peace! First kill you, then kill Luo!” Li sneered and moved toward him.

“Kill me? You want to kill me too? I’ll tear you apart!” Luo Tian’s face turned red as he rushed toward Li.

“Boom!” The robust figure, like a mountain, each step caused the platform to tremble.

“Terrifying flesh!” Li dodged mid-flight, his face slightly distorted as he evaded the attack. He summoned a golden mountain and hurled it toward Luo Tian.

“Roar!” Luo Tian didn’t fear the golden mountain at all, lifting his hands to block it.

“Boom!” A deep sound echoed as an invisible wave spread outward, shaking the entire platform.

The robust figure’s hands held thick arms with bulging veins like coiled dragons, and one could feel an explosive power radiating.

“Open up!” Luo Tian roared, lifting his hands to smash the mountain. The golden mountain shattered instantly.

“Boom!” Luo Tian’s fist smashed Li’s attack, and he launched himself into the air toward Li.

“Damn it!” Li’s face changed slightly, but he was too late to dodge. He raised a hand to form a golden barrier in front of him.

“Crack!” The barrier barely formed before it shattered into a massive dragon-like form, radiating fierce energy.

The golden mountain shattered, and the robust figure collided with Li’s body.

“Truly strong!” The crowd gasped, then watched the robust figure carrying Li into the air.

It wasn’t until they collided with the platform’s barrier that another deep sound echoed, and Li’s face turned pale. A crackling sound was heard as he felt his body being shattered.

“Die!” Luo Tian roared, his head slightly dizzy as he swung his hand toward Li’s neck.

“Die!” Li saw Luo Tian’s massive hand and, in desperation, raised his hand to summon a golden sword. He thrust it toward Luo Tian.

“Roar!” Luo Tian, in a frenzy, sent the golden sword flying and smashed it with his fist. Then he rushed toward Li again.

“Let’s fight!” Li, now in a desperate situation, his hair was disheveled and his hands were broken. He chanted martial arts techniques from his hands to block Luo Tian’s path, knowing he couldn’t let him get close. This was the most变态 he had ever seen in his years of experience.

“This Luo brother is simple!” The crowd watched as several figures stood at the front—senior elders of the Dragon Sect, including peak masters and some sect leaders.

“Just a simple-minded fool! Nothing if he’s not mistaken, but Luo should be at mid-stage celestial immortal. How could the Patriarch choose such a kid as sect master!” One elder spoke, and others like Zeng Qiong and Du Chengshi also nodded.

“Maybe this kid offended the Patriarch, but it’s a death trap!” Hearing Cai Wenzhou’s words, another middle-aged elder spoke. This was Zhang Jinghuan, a disciple of the Feng Peak and Sheng Guozhi, who had also died. With Du Chengshi and Zhang Jinghuan’s deaths, their peaks were now weak, making them more eager to become the next sect master.

“Qiu Ming, I feel guilty; this sect master position should have been yours!” Xue Changfeng addressed Qiu Ming, who stood there with a complex expression.

“But Luo Tian has done me good! I wouldn’t dare to fight him!” Qiu Ming spoke bitterly. This situation was beyond his control.

“Ah, father! If Luo Tian is our child, would your life still be uncertain?” Xue Yushan softly spoke to her husband and father-in-law, gently touching her slightly swollen belly with a soft gaze.

“Hmph.” Xue Changshan nodded silently. He, too, knew his daughter-in-law; he believed Qiu Ming was the most suitable for sect master. He had talent, strategy, and vision but lacked one weakness—his loyalty to his friends.

“So I’ll do it!” Xue Changshan muttered internally, his eyes flashing with a hint of cruelty.

“Boom! Boom!” The thunderous sounds echoed from the platform as the robust figure clashed with martial arts techniques, his body streaming with blood.

“Monstrous! So many martial arts techniques and he still endured them all with his flesh!” The crowd was stunned, gazing at the figure standing there.

Li’s face was pale; within a short time, he had already used countless martial arts techniques. Although they blocked his attacks, the toll on him was immense; his celestial energy had nearly run out.

“Roar!” As Li pondered how to counter, he suddenly roared with rage, his speed increasing dramatically. His body emitted a series of beast-like roars and appeared before Li.

“Crash!” A sandpot fist smashed into Li’s chest, producing a clear crackling sound that echoed through the barrier.

Li’s body was hurled backward, spitting blood and colliding with the barrier before falling to the ground.

“Roar!” Luo Tian roared again, his body moving like lightning toward Li’s side and stomping down.

“Stop!” Seeing Luo Tian still attacking, the crowd threw him off the platform but this time allowed it since the sect was in a dire state.

Several true celestial energy formations凝聚 into long dragons, flying toward Luo Tian to stop him.
