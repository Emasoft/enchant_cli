"Luo Tian! He is the Ghost Valley Disciple!" The people instantly connected it to the previous incident of the Ghost Valley Disciple's appearance.

Numerous formidable cultivators burst forth from the Nine Immortal Mountains, except for Mount Xumi, all other mountains flew towards the Mirage Heaven Sea. Each of their auras was extremely powerful, they were all Immortal Kings. At this moment, Luo Tian had no idea he had already become renowned throughout the Upper Three Heavens. His speed was astonishing, flying towards Mount Supreme Sky.

However, Luo Tian had already sensed something amiss during his flight. He encountered several True Immortal level masters, all disciples of the Nine Immortal Mountains, but they hadn't noticed him.

At first, Luo Tian didn't care much about it. But unintentionally, he overheard a conversation between several people.

"The Nine Immortal Mountains' Killing Edict—Ghost Valley Disciple's secret has been exposed!" Luo Tian was stunned, never expecting his identity as a Ghost Valley Disciple would have such an impact.

"Damned!" Luo Tian cursed under his breath, no longer rushing towards Mount Supreme Sky. He was only half a day's journey away from it, but he had already heard the discussions in Mount Supreme Sky.

"Even Mount Supreme Sky has joined in!" A bad premonition arose in Luo Tian's heart. Perhaps releasing Fu Tianliang was a colossal mistake, one that would plunge him into eternal ruin.

"Everyone in the Immortal World is hunting me. Even several peak Immortal Kings are personally coming to kill me!" Luo Tian's spirit trembled. If those peak Immortal Kings encountered him, one palm would be enough to crush him.

Luo Tian stopped on a mountain peak and directly landed at the Supreme Sky Stone, beginning to ponder his situation with growing anxiety.

"It's truly a death sentence!" Luo Tian stood on the crimson earth, muttering to himself.

"Bad luck! Why did I end up with such a master!" The Supreme Sky Stone's bitter voice echoed, sensing that the days ahead would be turbulent. It might often get beaten.

"This earth-moving technique must have been left by the Ghost Valley Master, who knew that being a Ghost Valley Disciple meant constantly running away!" Luo Tian let out a bitter laugh.

"From what those people said, the Mirage Heaven Sea has been sealed off. I can't go to the Central Three Heavens, even if I could, I couldn't. I mustn't bring this trouble to the Tianyuan Sect!"

"Only hell!" Luo Tian's brows furrowed, thinking about where he might be safest. In hell, perhaps it wouldn't be affected by the Ghost Valley Mandate. His identity would naturally be safe.

"Only less than a year remains before my master's soul can't endure it!" Luo Tian sighed deeply. No matter what, he had to ensure Zhang Daotian's safety.

Originally, Luo Tian planned to meet Gu Tianshu first and then go to the Eternal Life Mountain to retrieve Zhang Daotian. But he hadn't expected to obtain a Ghost Valley Mandate, which led to so many events.

"Come to Supreme Sky Mountain!" As Luo Tian was at a loss, the identity token on his waist suddenly emitted waves. A hurried voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Senior Brother!" Luo Tian exclaimed, having no intention of going to Supreme Sky Mountain anymore. Besides people like Nan Gong Yuqing and Diao Dezhu, he trusted no one.

Zhang Ziping was the only one Luo Tian would believe in. Therefore, Luo Tian waved his hand and put on the Thousand Transformations Mask, which could avoid a lot of trouble.

After thinking, Luo Tian flew out from the Supreme Sky Stone again, transforming into a fierce and terrifying middle-aged man, flying towards Mount Supreme Sky. However, upon appearing, Luo Tian was speechless again. Even with the Thousand Transformations Mask on, it couldn't block the two characters "Ghost Valley" on his back.

"Damned! If I had known being a Ghost Valley Disciple was so difficult, I wouldn't have become one. This is clearly trying to kill me!" Luo Tian cursed in his heart, but there was nothing he could do. He decided not to hide his appearance anymore. The two characters "Ghost Valley" on his back were the mark, so he had to fly towards Mount Supreme Sky. He felt that was where his last chance of survival lay.

Luo Tian was an Immortal King, and his speed was astonishing. In a desperate flight, he reached the outskirts of Mount Supreme Sky in just over two hours.

"Who!" Two mountain guards immediately showed a serious expression, looking at Luo Tian who had appeared nearby.

"Luo Tian!" The two saw Luo Tian and were stunned, instantly recognizing him. Their eyes showed tension, immediately sending a message to Mount Supreme Sky.

As the two disciples sent out their message, the entire Mount Supreme Sky trembled. A series of figures appeared.

"Luo Tian! He still dares to show his face!"

"Previously, how many times did Mount Supreme Sky help him? He returned to establish his sect. Finally, he didn't join us Mount Supreme Sky but chose to set up his own sect!"

"Treacherous dog! Now that he's in trouble, he comes back to Mount Supreme Sky. Even if the Nine Immortal Mountains unite to kill him, we can't protect him!" Numerous elders of Mount Supreme Sky appeared outside the mountain, glaring at Luo Tian with contempt.

Luo Tian felt some guilt and stood at the mountain gate without moving, gazing at those disciples of Mount Supreme Sky with disdain in their eyes.

"Come forward!" A dignified voice echoed from the summit of Mount Supreme Sky. A displacement force acted upon Luo Tian's body.

Luo Tian's figure appeared in a grand hall. The Supreme Sky Immortal King sat upright with authority, and beside him were several old men. These old men had never met Luo Tian before, obviously his appearance had already stirred up the entire Mount Supreme Sky.

"You little scoundrel, you really know how to stir things up!" The Supreme Sky Immortal King smiled slightly, gazing at Luo Tian.

"What else do you want to say? Kill him!" One old man stood up, his white hair fluttering wildly. His eyes glared at Luo Tian with the aura of an Immortal King in the middle stage.

"Sixth Brother, when will you change your temper!" Another old man spoke. This old man had met Luo Tian before, the number one alchemist in the Immortal World, Jiang Yuexiong.

Luo Tian instantly guessed the identities of these old men—brothers of the Supreme Sky Immortal King.

The Supreme Sky Immortal King had nine brothers. Luo Tian had met two of them, Jiang Taibai and Jiang Yuexiong. He had only known about these people before when he was at Mount Supreme Sky, but had never seen them.

"Yes, Sixth Brother, let him speak!" Jiang Taibai also spoke, his voice carrying a lazy tone and even took two sips of wine.

"A family of nine Immortal Kings, truly formidable!" Luo Tian sighed in admiration. Since he had come here, he had already bet everything on Mount Supreme Sky.

"Little fellow, what do you want to say? Speak!" The Supreme Sky Immortal King spoke, gazing at Luo Tian. It was impossible to guess what the Supreme Sky Immortal King was thinking.

"I want to meet Gu Tianshu!" Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Jiang Taibai. Jiang Taibai's body slightly trembled.

Chapter 2427: The Ruins of the Ancient Heaven Court

"Gu Tianshu!" Upon hearing Luo Tian say this name, people in the hall were slightly stunned. They had never heard of such a person before.

Jiang Taibai's brows furrowed slightly, gazing at Luo Tian and speaking softly: "Are you sure?"

"Yes!" Luo Tian nodded, gazing at Jiang Taibai.

"Little Nine, what's going on? Who is Gu Tianshu?" People looked with confusion at Jiang Taibai.

"Ruins of the Ancient Heaven Court!" Jiang Taibai spoke softly. Upon his words, people in the hall slightly paused.

"Heaven Court!" One old man exclaimed, even the Supreme Sky Immortal King showed an expression of surprise.

The Heaven Court represented power. It was an era older than the Ghost Valley Master, a more ancient world.

It was an age of强者 (strong individuals), where Immortal Kings were everywhere. The supreme ruler governing this world was the Heaven Court.

The Heaven Court had countless strong individuals, but how powerful it was—no one knew. It was said to exist beyond the Immortal World, even the ancient Dao itself was under its control.

However, for unknown reasons, the great Dao collapsed, and the Heaven Court also perished. The Immortal World experienced a catastrophe, almost leading to its extinction.

From that time on, the Immortal World was divided into nine heavens, chaotic and disordered. A great cultivator, the Ghost Valley Master, rose in the chaos, establishing the Nine Immortal Mountains and controlling the Immortal World.

"Little Nine, do you know where the ruins of the Heaven Court are?" People in the hall became excited, gazing at Jiang Taibai. They hadn't expected Jiang Taibai had once visited the ruins of the Heaven Court.

"It does exist. I once experienced a terrifying trial in Mount Wubie, and it was there that I met Gu Tianshu. Finally, I entered the ruins of the Heaven Court!"

"But I was ultimately eliminated!" Jiang Taibai's eyes showed a hint of bitterness.

"Immortal World's forbidden area, Mount Wubie!" Upon hearing Jiang Taibai's words, people exclaimed again, waiting for his next words.

"The ruins of the Heaven Court also have strong individuals. To be precise, it's like hell, possessing the power to destroy the entire Immortal World!"

"But these people seem unable to leave the ruins of the Heaven Court, so they haven't appeared in the Immortal World!"

"There are only 108 people there, but each one is so powerful that they inspire awe!" Jiang Taibai spoke, his eyes filled with admiration. It was a period he didn't want to recall.

"One hundred and eight people, capable of overturning the entire Immortal World. Little Nine, are you joking?" One old man spoke, his cultivation at the late stage of Immortal King, clearly not believing.

How vast was the Immortal World. Not to mention the Nine Immortal Mountains, even the hidden strong individuals in the Upper Three Heavens were a staggering number. One hundred and eight people could threaten the Immortal World, which was hard for them to believe.

"Third Brother, don't doubt it. I think those people aren't humans, they're gods!"

"My talent is clear to you all. But at that time, those who participated in the trial with me were three people. One of them was Gu Tianshu. At that time, I was at the half-step Immortal King stage, but I couldn't withstand three strikes from Gu Tianshu!"

"And Gu Tianshu had just entered the ruins of the Heaven Court, becoming one of the 108 people!" Jiang Taibai spoke, causing the hall to fall silent.

Jiang Taibai was their youngest brother. They knew his talent well. Although he was the youngest, it must be said that besides the Supreme Sky Immortal King, Jiang Taibai had the best talent and was their most optimistic candidate to reach the peak of Immortal King.

Jiang Taibai's personality was very arrogant, and to have someone make Jiang Taibai like this was rare.

"Humanity has its limits, the heavens have their boundaries!"

"I never expected Mount Wubie to conceal the entrance of the Heaven Court!" People in the hall sighed softly.

"Why didn't you say it earlier? We could enter the ruins of the Heaven Court. There must be ancient treasures from the Heaven Court! If we obtain them, Mount Supreme Sky will surely rise to the top of the Immortal World!" People in the hall became excited.

"Don't think about it. Mount Wubie is very dangerous! I once entered it, and with my strength, I didn't even reach the end of Mount Wubie!"

"Little Nine, how did you enter Mount Wubie?" The Supreme Sky Immortal King frowned slightly, gazing at Jiang Taibai.

"Because I was young and arrogant!"

"Back then, I dueled with a senior of the Eternal Life Mountain. We were fighting and ended up entering Mount Wubie. Finally, I mysteriously entered a barrier and was transported to the trial ground!" Jiang Taibai smiled lightly, shaking his head without explaining why.

However, Jiang Taibai's words made his brothers laugh lightly. In his youth, Jiang Taibai was very arrogant and believed himself unbeatable in his rank.

"Little fellow, think carefully. If you secretly stay here at Mount Supreme Sky, you might be safer!"

"But once you enter Mount Wubie, it's possible you won't return. You might die before even meeting Gu Tianshu. It's better to stay at Mount Supreme Sky!"

"That's why I didn't tell you Gu Tianshu's whereabouts. But I hadn't expected you to reach the Immortal King stage so quickly!" Jiang Taibai spoke, gazing at Luo Tian with admiration.

"Indeed, the speed of this little fellow's growth is something I've never seen before!" Jiang Yuexiong also spoke softly. When he met Luo Tian back then, he was very weak. Now, he had to face Luo Tian seriously.

"Speaking of which, I'm afraid to go!" Luo Tian muttered in his heart and started thinking. Mount Wubie had been mentioned before, but he had never thought of entering it.

"Whether you go or not is up to you. If you do, I can send you into Mount Wubie!" The Supreme Sky Immortal King finally spoke.

"Big Brother, are you sure to protect this little fellow?" As the Supreme Sky Immortal King's words fell, several people in the hall were unwilling.

Luo Tian was now a hot potato. Anyone who touched him would cause great trouble. Mainly, it was Luo Tian's actions that made them dislike him.

"Traitor!" Most people in Mount Supreme Sky now saw Luo Tian as a traitor.

"Buzz..." As everyone was speaking in the hall, a black cloud appeared over Mount Supreme Sky. A heavy pressure made all people of Mount Supreme Sky shocked.

"Covering the Heaven!" The Supreme Sky Immortal King's eyes flashed with coldness, and his body vanished from the hall.

"Stay here. Don't move!" The Supreme Sky Immortal King's voice echoed in the hall.

"Who dares to cover my Mount Supreme Sky!" Jiang Yuexiong and others showed cold glares, also vanishing from their original positions.

The black clouds radiated a cold aura, as if countless ghosts were roaring within them. They blocked the sun, plunging Mount Supreme Sky into darkness.

Covering Heaven was a unique technique of several peak Immortal Kings. An Immortal King at the peak stage, domain power had reached its pinnacle and could influence heavenly forces, forming a Covering Heaven.

This action was an act of provocation, a humiliation for the one being covered.

"Ghost King, what do you mean by this?" Gray clouds rose. The Supreme Sky Immortal King's eyes were cold, appearing in the sky above. The black clouds began to oppose each other with a thunderous sound.

" I heard that Luo Tian is here. I came to see if you've killed him!" A black figure stood in the dark clouds, speaking coldly.

The Ghost Valley Disciple, bearing the Ghost Valley Mandate, cultivated the Ghost Sealing Seal. He was extremely effective against ghosts and ghost cultivators. The Ghost King Sect was the number one ghost sect in the Immortal World, naturally not allowing anyone to undermine their position. Therefore, the Ghost King was the one most eager to kill those with the Ghost Valley Mandate.

"I don't need you to care about whether I've killed him or not!" The Supreme Sky Immortal King responded strongly. With a thunderous sound, the black ghost clouds were compressed to a thousand zhang in range. In their place was gray clouds, obviously the Supreme Sky Immortal King had gained the upper hand.

Peak Immortal Kings also differed in strength. The Supreme Sky Immortal King was an Immortal King who had existed before the Ghost King arrived in the Immortal World. His strength was slightly stronger than that of the Ghost King.

"Then what about me?" The Supreme Sky Immortal King's words had just fallen when another authoritative voice echoed again. Green clouds drifted over.

"Supreme Sky, are you trying to defy the Nine Immortal Mountains' Killing Edict? According to the agreement, if anyone defies it, they won't have a good outcome!" The Eternal Life Immortal King stood in the green clouds.

As the Eternal Life Immortal King appeared, the gray clouds of the Supreme Sky became unstable, and his face also turned serious.

"Take him away and go to Mount Wubie!" The Supreme Sky Immortal King transmitted a thought to Jiang Yuexiong and others. He felt something was unusual.

Jiang Yuexiong and Jiang Taibai's hearts slightly stirred, but they still quietly returned to the hall where Luo Tian and others had been.

"Go!" Jiang Yuexiong didn't speak, directly addressing Luo Tian.

The three of them walked out of the hall and followed Jiang Yuexiong and Jiang Taibai towards another hall.

"Is there a big problem?" Luo Tian quickly transmitted thoughts to Jiang Taibai, looking at the three-colored clouds in the sky. The powerful pressure made Luo Tian's heart tremble.

"Don't ask so much, just go!" Jiang Taibai replied, leading Luo Tian to quickly walk through Mount Supreme Sky.

"Did that brother give him medicine? Why is he so determined to protect this little fellow?"

"I don't know. Brother's actions have always been mysterious. Perhaps he foresaw something!" The other brothers of the Supreme Sky Immortal King felt puzzled but suppressed their doubts. Now Mount Supreme Sky was facing a crisis, two peak Immortal Kings had come to cover the heaven, obviously with ill intentions.

"The Eternal Life Immortal King, that bastard, is definitely going to take this opportunity to attack!" The elders of Mount Supreme Sky spoke. Two sects, originally had friction.

Clouds rolled, as the Supreme Sky Immortal King was confronting them. A woman stepped through the sky with cold eyes.

The Medicine King and the Soul Mountain's peak Immortal King also appeared. Several peak Immortal Kings gathered again shortly after.

"Supreme Sky, quickly hand over the Ghost Valley Disciple. Otherwise, don't blame me for not valuing our years of friendship!" The Soul Mountain's peak Immortal King spoke, his voice filled with anger.

"Supreme Sky, are you really going to protect this little fellow?" The Medicine King also spoke at the same time.

"He's not in our Supreme Sky. Why are you so determined to provoke us?" The Supreme Sky Immortal King coldly replied.

"Then fight, why find excuses!" The Supreme Sky Immortal King directly pushed aside the issue.

While several peak Immortal Kings were confronting each other, Jiang Taibai and Jiang Yuexiong led Luo Tian into a hall.

The hall was very spacious, with no other things inside except for a teleportation array.

"Go. This is the teleportation array to Nine Heavens City. Here's a map to Mount Wubie. From now on, it's all up to you!" Jiang Taibai spoke to Luo Tian and handed him a map.

"This..." Luo Tian felt touched, took the map, but was worried about Mount Supreme Sky's situation.

"Don't waste time. The longer you stay here, the more dangerous it is for us. We'll be fine!" Jiang Taibai spoke and kicked Luo Tian onto the teleportation array.

"This debt, I'll never forget!" Luo Tian muttered in his heart and stepped onto the teleportation array. He looked at the Supreme Sky Immortal King standing proudly above the hall.

"Buzz..." The teleportation array activated, and Luo Tian's figure disappeared from the hall.

"I hope you have a smooth journey!" Jiang Taibai whispered, and he and Jiang Yuexiong stepped out of the hall.

At the moment Luo Tian teleported, several peak Immortal Kings' faces suddenly changed.

"There's a teleportation fluctuation!" The Eternal Life Immortal King's face darkened. He clapped his hands, and the green door suddenly expanded. An immense pressure was released, thundering towards the void.

Almost immediately after the Eternal Life Immortal King acted, the Supreme Sky Immortal King had already prepared for him and activated his ancient wooden sword.

Light flashed, the ancient wooden sword's divine laws flowed. It instantly transformed into a heaven-opening sword and slashed towards the green door.

Boom...

In an instant, two supreme divine weapons disappeared from people's sight. They collided in the void.

The sky collapsed, a deafening thunderous sound followed the opened sky, spreading to Mount Supreme Sky's people, making their faces pale.

"He escaped!" The Eternal Life Immortal King's face was grim. He pressed his hand to his forehead, and a green eye opened, gazing into the void.

"Nine Heavens City!" In an instant, the Eternal Life Immortal King stepped forward to head for Nine Heavens City.

Crash... As the Eternal Life Immortal King stepped forward, a hundred streams of light flew out from the void. They surrounded the Eternal Life Immortal King.

Kill intent surged, making the Eternal Life Immortal King stop. He gazed at the hundred streams of light.

"Supreme Sky's Sword Array!" The Eternal Life Immortal King spoke solemnly. Those hundred streams of light were all Supreme Sky swords.

"You've moved your hand, and you still want to leave?" The Supreme Sky Immortal King's face showed anger. He pointed his finger, controlling the massive sword array to attack the Eternal Life Immortal King.

Sword qi like dragons, the ancient wooden sword instantly roared and slashed towards the Eternal Life Immortal King.

Boom Boom Boom...

The green door flew out from the void, blocking in front of the Eternal Life Immortal King. It collided with those towering swords.

"Supreme Sky has truly moved to the extreme, even using the Supreme Sky Sword Array!" Other peak Immortal Kings showed admiration.

"You all still watching? Don't you go after him?" The Eternal Life Immortal King shouted, controlling the Eternal Life Door to fight against the Supreme Sky Sword Array while also shouting at others. At this moment, he couldn't break through the sword array.

Hearing the Supreme Sky Immortal King's words, other peak Immortal Kings were surprised for a moment but then got up and flew towards Nine Heavens City.

"Come in!" The Supreme Sky Immortal King laughed. A hundred long swords expanded, surrounding the peak Immortal Kings. At the same time, the massive Mount Supreme Sky emitted a series of thunderous sounds. A gray dragon flew out from Mount Supreme Sky.

"Blind Heaven Technique, you've really used the essence of Mount Supreme Sky!" Seeing that gray dragon emitting a destructive and annihilating aura, several peak Immortal Kings' faces slightly changed.

"Using Mount Supreme Sky's essence to trap you for an hour is still possible!" The Supreme Sky Immortal King laughed, and the gray dragon transformed into a hundred, engraved on the ancient Supreme Sky sword. The power again shocked the heavens.

"This is the technique of peak immortals!" Mount Supreme Sky's disciples, with eyes full of shock, looked at the hundred swords hovering in the sky and spoke.

"The essence power, Supreme Sky Immortal King's master has truly mastered the Blind Heaven Technique. He can even draw Mount Supreme Sky's essence to attack enemies!" The disciples of Mount Supreme Sky discussed.

"But that is a hundred years' worth of essence!" Then everyone felt心疼 (painful). Essence was elusive, and people were born with it. Mount Supreme Sky pursued the Blind Heaven Technique. Once mastered, it could avoid misfortune and seek good fortune.

Mount Supreme Sky's people valued essence. The Supreme Sky Immortal King had drawn Mount Supreme Sky's hundred years' worth of essence, which seemed not much. But the disciples of Mount Supreme Sky still felt painful.

"This can block us?" The Eternal Life Immortal King coldly laughed. While fighting against the Supreme Sky Sword Array, he also transmitted thoughts to the Eternal Life Sect's elders.

Other peak Immortal Kings also sent messages, ordering their subordinates to intercept Luo Tian. At this moment, the situation was turbulent.

"Your fate is in your hands!" The Supreme Sky Immortal King muttered to himself. He had done all he could.

...

Nine Heavens City, as the only city in the Upper Three Heavens, was naturally bustling. Especially these days, Luo Tian's incident spread. Not only the disciples but also the strong individuals from the Nine Immortal Mountains had come out, so now Nine Heavens City was deeper in water.

Buzz... A massive vortex appeared over the sky of Nine Heavens City. A figure fell from above, crashing heavily into the ground of Nine Heavens City.

Boom... The entire ground trembled. A large number of blue stone slabs were also lifted and shattered by the powerful impact, attracting the attention of people in Nine Heavens City.

"What is it?" People showed confusion, gazing at the location of the incident. They looked towards the dust that had risen.

Luo Tian's head was dizzy and disoriented. The Eternal Life Door from the Eternal Life Immortal King hadn't injured him, but it had affected the teleportation, causing Luo Tian to fall into Nine Heavens City.

"Boom..." Luo Tian staggered up, coughing twice. His eyes looked around.

As Luo Tian stood up, the two characters "Ghost Valley" on his back also appeared. Although there was dust blocking it, it was still clearly visible.

"Ghost Valley!" People saw the golden "Ghost Valley" characters through the dust.

"Oh no!" Luo Tian cursed, and he immediately jumped out of the dust towards the outside of Nine Heavens City.

"Chase!" As Luo Tian took off, several figures flew out from Nine Heavens City towards the direction of Luo Tian.

These people were stationed at Nine Heavens City's teleportation array, preventing Luo Tian from escaping to the Central Three Heavens. Therefore, as soon as Luo Tian appeared, they chased after him.

Four figures, one Immortal King in the middle stage and four in the early stage, chased after Luo Tian's direction.

"Damn it! If I had an Immortal King in the middle stage, I would kill you!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly. He knew he couldn't linger; if he did, it wouldn't just be four people.

Huangquan Step combined with the earth-moving technique made his speed extremely fast. In an instant, he created a distance, making the several strong individuals behind him look shocked.

"How fast!"

"You follow after him. I'll go ahead first!" The Immortal King in the middle stage spoke to the three, and his body flashed. His speed increased significantly, chasing after Luo Tian.

However, even with the increase in speed, the Immortal King in the middle stage still couldn't catch up to Luo Tian. The distance between them gradually increased.

"Luo Tian is heading towards Ma Ping Mountain!" The Immortal King in the middle stage estimated the approximate direction and transmitted thoughts to his people. At the same time, other Immortal King-level strong individuals also quickly combined together like a large net, beginning to surround.

"I can't shake them off!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly. The Immortal King in the middle stage was like a piece of chewing gum stuck to him.

"If this continues, he'll definitely report his position to others. If I'm really surrounded, I truly have no way out!"

"The Supreme Sky Immortal King must have spent a great deal to let me escape. I can't let the Supreme Sky Immortal King's effort be in vain!" Luo Tian's eyes showed madness. He bit his teeth and took out a pill, not thinking twice before putting it in his mouth—this was the nine-star immortal pill from the black market.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian took the immortal pill, a block of black clouds enveloped him. A series of thunderstorms roamed within the dark clouds, beginning to fly with Luo Tian.

"Transcending Heaven?" Seeing the thunderclouds over Luo Tian's head, the Immortal King who had been chasing him showed an expression of disbelief.

"Crack..." In shock, a bolt of lightning struck from the thunderclouds and hit Luo Tian's body.

The lightning power shattered, entering Luo Tian's dantian and striking the black magic platform.

Chapter 2429: Entering

The terrifying medicinal power spread throughout Luo Tian's body. His entire body turned into a fat man, and the lightning power striking the magic platform also made Luo Tian extremely painful.

"Ah..."

"Let it burn!" Luo Tian roared, his eyes showing madness. Nine-color flames began to burn. That which should have gathered in Luo Tian's dantian was directly swept away by the nine-color flames, forming a shocking wave. The thunderous sound made Luo Tian's speed increase again, flying towards the distance.

"Damned!" The Immortal King in the middle stage who had been chasing Luo Tian looked grim. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to still increase his speed.

"Is he really an Immortal King in the early stage?" The middle-aged man muttered to himself, biting his teeth and beginning to burn his own cultivation to track Luo Tian. He also continuously reported Luo Tian's position to the elders in the Upper Three Heavens.

The net was gradually tightening. Luo Tian's head had thunderclouds, and after flying for a full day, the sky's lightning had finally dissipated. Luo Tian had digested half of the nine-star immortal pill's medicinal power and was finally approaching Mount Wubie according to the map.

The net that had been hunting Luo Tian also finally tightened, and in front of him were three Immortal Kings in the early stage.

"It's Luo Tian!" The three exclaimed, their eyes showing joy. As soon as they saw Luo Tian, they immediately attacked.

"Boom..." With a thunderous sound, three powerful martial arts techniques pushed forward, making Luo Tian's face extremely grim.

"Kill..." Luo Tian's eyes turned blood-red. The Dragon Abyss Sword emitted a dazzling divine light and slashed towards the three martial arts techniques.

Boom Boom Boom

The sky exploded, the world thundered. The three martial arts techniques were directly shattered by Luo Tian's single strike. Luo Tian's body also disappeared from the three's sight.

"Where is he?" The three were surprised, looking at the shattered sky.

"Did he die?" One of them spoke, his voice filled with joy.

"You died!" The three's words hadn't finished when a cold voice echoed in their ears. A streak of light rushed to their vicinity, causing the three's bodies to pause.

A sharp blade sliced through one of the Immortal Kings' necks, and his head rolled. Blood spilled from Luo Tian's lips as he appeared in front of the three.

After killing one, Luo Tian didn't linger. He flew again towards the distance.

"Kid, where are you running!" Just a moment later, the Immortal King in the middle stage who had been chasing Luo Tian also looked pale and chased after Luo Tian.

Luo Tian didn't respond, continuing to digest the medicinal power and burning his cultivation, becoming a streak of light flying towards Mount Wubie.

"One hour left. The last hour!" Luo Tian shouted in his heart, his body was weary.

The combined attack of three Immortal Kings in the early stage had made Luo Tian's body pay a price. Plus, he had been struck by lightning for a day.

"He's heading towards Mount Wubie! He wants to enter Mount Wubie!" Seeing Luo Tian's direction of flight, the Immortal King in the middle stage reported his position again.

"Mount Wubie!"

"Yes, only Mount Wubie can give him a chance of survival!" The elders in the Upper Three Heavens immediately erupted, and a series of figures converged towards Mount Wubie.

"Mount Wubie? Supreme Sky, you've really given him a good place!" The Eternal Life Immortal King stood in the sky. After being trapped for an hour, he immediately flew towards Luo Tian's direction.

"Let's go to Mount Wubie!" The Ghost King's face was also dark, taking a step forward towards the direction of Mount Wubie.

"Kid, it's all up to your fate!" The Supreme Sky Immortal King's old eyes showed a hint of exhaustion.

"Big Brother, why are you helping this kid so much?" An old man in the late stage of Immortal King spoke, looking at the Supreme Sky Immortal King with confusion.

"Immortal Road collapsed, fate ended. Recently, three thousand small worlds collided with the Immortal World. Various signs indicate that the catastrophe of the Heaven Court era might appear again!"

"And the Ghost Valley Disciple is a variable in the Immortal World. I bet on it, this variable might be beneficial to the Immortal World!"

"The Ghost Valley Master was so brilliant. Perhaps he foresaw this catastrophe in the Immortal World and left behind the Ghost Valley Mandate, giving the Immortal World a hope—a hope for the Immortal World to continue existing and for us to continue existing!" The Supreme Sky Immortal King spoke softly, causing his brothers to fall silent.

"The Ghost Valley Disciple has appeared several times before, but none of them escaped being killed. Can this kid escape?" Jiang Yuexiong spoke.

"The Ghost Valley Disciple is all people with extraordinary fate. I can't see this kid's fate!" The Supreme Sky Immortal King spoke, causing the faces of his brothers to show disbelief.

"The Nine Immortal Mountains have existed for too long. Those peak Immortal Kings don't want anyone who can shake the Nine Immortal Mountains!"

"Therefore, it's said that the Ghost Valley Disciple is a variable in the Immortal World, one who can destroy it!" The Supreme Sky Immortal King spoke softly and sighed.

"This kid is far more complicated than you imagine. Though it seems like a dead end, there's still a chance of survival—that is Mount Wubie. I once entered Mount Wubie, and I could feel a terrifying fluctuation in its depths!" The Supreme Sky Immortal King whispered softly, his hands forming seals and beginning to calculate.

...

"Almost there. Almost there!" Luo Tian was still running at this moment, having flown for half an hour.

After flying another half an hour, Luo Tian finally saw the vast mountain range. Even from a distance, he could feel the immense and continuous pressure of the mountains, giving him a strong sense of oppression.

"Luo Tian!" However, as Luo Tian flew closer again, his face suddenly changed.

Beyond the endless mountains, dozens of figures stood there, wearing clothes of various colors. The only thing they had in common was that each one radiated a powerful aura.

"Luo Tian, you want to enter Mount Wubie? Dream on!" A series of shouts echoed. Dozens of people stood there like a chasm, their faces filled with mockery.

"Kill!" In an instant, divine light spread. A series of martial arts techniques rose up, emitting a powerful fluctuation that made the sky tremble.

"What to do?" Luo Tian's face was grim. Dozens of Immortal Kings, among whom he even saw an Immortal King in the late stage. He couldn't break through.

The thunderous sound was overwhelming. As Luo Tian thought, dozens of martial arts techniques came down upon him.

A path of destruction, violent martial arts techniques that shook the sky and earth. The destructive atmosphere made Luo Tian not even think, turning around to flee.

...
