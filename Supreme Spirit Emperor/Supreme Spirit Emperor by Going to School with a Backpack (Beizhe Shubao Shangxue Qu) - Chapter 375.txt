“Whether alive or dead, no one knows. Some say the Master of Breaking Heaven's flesh and blood resides deep within the Underworld, suppressing the fortune of all tribes. Others claim he ascended to immortality! That radiant light must be the guiding beam of salvation!” The group murmured among themselves.

Lu Tian listened to their whispers, his heart surging with waves of astonishment. As one of the oldest royal clans, their lineage preserved ancient scrolls. Yet Lu Tian had once dwelled among the Star Moon Clan and never heard of such a legend—evidently, the clan wished to keep this humiliating history hidden from its people.

The noble clans had always regarded humanity as mere insects, yet a single era's sovereign had slain countless of their elites. It was a sorrowful truth.

“Who knows if we’ll find that sovereign who crushed so many royal clans?” The group sighed softly, their gazes fixed on the depths of the Underworld.

Just as all tribes doubted the death of a royal sovereign, so too did they refuse to believe that humanity’s era sovereign had perished. After all, such a power could not easily die—two eras of life span meant their contemporaries had long since passed. Who could confirm that such a sage had already attained Nirvana?

Yet as they debated, a black altar emerged before their eyes. The altar emitted a continuous hum, its aura making them grimace.

A withered figure sat atop the altar, exuding a decaying aura yet devoid of life. Its body was cloaked in gray dust, obscuring its face and making it impossible to discern the elder’s features.

“Clearly, this person was once a sage of great power! His flesh still endures!” The group hesitated to approach, for the altar’s divine laws flowed ceaselessly into the corpse beneath.

“Wait… why does this black altar feel so familiar?” Tu Feiyang’s eyes narrowed, scrutinizing the altar with confusion.

“Another Soul Summoning Stone!” Fan Jingyu suddenly gasped, his gaze fixed on the altar with disbelief.

Fan’s words struck like a hammer against Lu Tian’s group, their breaths quickening with shock.

“Such a massive Soul Summoning Stone exists!” Jin Ziyang murmured, his voice trembling. Lu Tian had once possessed a fragment of such a stone, which had already stirred envy—now this mountain-sized relic appeared before them, enough to ignite anyone’s greed.

“Legend has it the Underworld’s King’s Palace was forged from Soul Summoning Stones. Though this size cannot craft a Soul Summoning Palace, it could certainly forge an ultimate treasure!” Tu Feiyang’s eyes gleamed with fervor as he lunged toward the altar.

The others followed suit, even Fu Xingyue and Fu Xinyang.

“This artifact cannot be claimed by one alone!” Lu Tian stood still, watching them rush toward the altar. Such a divine object would inevitably be divided unless true death occurred—yet in that case, Fu Xingyue’s royal weapon would surely sweep them all aside.

“First, break the divine laws on the altar!” They exchanged glances before unleashing martial techniques toward the black altar.

“Boom… boom…” The powerful techniques struck the altar, sending tremors into the sky. Dazed by the Soul Summoning Stone’s allure, they had forgotten this was the Underworld.

“Crack… crack… crack…” The divine chains of inscriptions shattered under their relentless strikes.

“Who arranged this altar? Even after so many years, these inscriptions still hold such power!” They marveled, yet continued their assault.

The thunderous noise echoed through the heavens as the seemingly decayed corpse atop the altar was battered by their attacks. Gray dust scattered, gradually revealing its true form. Lu Tian scrutinized it closely.

“Boom!” The final divine chain shattered, and the group’s faces lit with joy as they leapt onto the altar.

“Regardless of who you were in life, your obstruction of our treasure is unforgivable!” Tu Feiyang smiled, raising his hand to strike the decayed corpse.

“It’s him!”

“Stop!” As Tu Feiyang’s hand lifted, Lu Tian finally recognized the corpse’s identity and shouted urgently.

“Boom!” Yet his words came too late. Even if they had arrived sooner, Tu Feiyang would have ignored them—this colossal Soul Summoning Stone was too tempting.

The decayed corpse could not withstand Tu Feiyang’s strike, disintegrating into dust upon the altar.

“What’s wrong?” Tu Feiyang and the others looked at Lu Tian, puzzled by his sudden outburst.

“Get down!” Lu Tian’s face contorted with alarm, shouting at Fu Xingyue as he stared intently at the black altar.

“It’s the Seventh Soul Sealing Master, Qiu Jingming!” Lu Tian observed their stunned expressions before addressing Fu Xingyue again.

“Boom… boom…” The ground trembled as the black altar began to violently shake, emitting thick black mist. Fu Xingyue’s group paled instantly.

“Roar…” A deep growl echoed from beneath the altar, sending shockwaves through Fu Xingyue’s group.

Even a fool would now realize the altar concealed something formidable. They swiftly retreated to Lu Tian and Fu Xingxuan’s side.

“Boom!” As they landed, the mountain-sized black altar suddenly burst open, releasing a torrent of thick black mist as if tearing open hell’s gates.

“Thank you for not disappointing me—your greed was evident the moment you saw the Soul Summoning Stone!” A deep, weathered voice echoed, sending shivers through Lu Tian’s group.

“Crack… crack…” The gray ground cracked violently, black energy rising in waves.

“Retreat!” Their默契 was unprecedented as they instantly leapt back a thousand feet.

As they landed, a mountain of black energy erupted from the ground, rising like a colossal demon mountain before their eyes.

“My heavens! What have I seen!” Tu Feiyang’s face was filled with disbelief, rubbing his eyes in shock.

“I finally understand why the Underworld holds so many souls!” Jin Ziyang trembled, his voice laced with awe.

“Don’t ponder—focus on surviving this crisis!” Fu Xingyue snapped, his gaze fixed on the black figure atop the mountain.

Chapter 1496: Soul Sealing Master vs. Soul Sealing Master

The mountain thundered, leaving Lu Tian’s group speechless with amazement.

“This is a mountain entirely forged from Soul Summoning Stones!” They stammered, unable to speak as they gazed at the black mountain.

At that moment, Lu Tian finally understood why the Underworld held so many souls—such a Soul Summoning Mountain existed, making it impossible to avoid.

Yet soon, they ceased thinking about the Soul Summoning Mountain and instead stared at the black figure atop it with terror.

“An Ascendant-level soul!” Their faces paled as they gazed at the solid black figure, their eyes wide with disbelief.

“How did he achieve this? So long after, yet still so powerful!” Lu Tian’s mind was puzzled.

Though his knowledge was vast, he had seen only withered souls surviving beyond one era—each reduced to a shadow of their former selves. None had retained the vigor and peak state of their original souls as Qiu Jingming did.

“Is it due to the Underworld?” Lu Tian mused, thinking of the endless souls here—clearly not accumulated over a single era.

“Thanks for breaking his flesh and altar; I might have taken longer to emerge!” Qiu Jingming’s black soul stood atop the mountain, his gaze filled with a faint gratitude before scanning Lu Tian’s group.

“As a token of appreciation, I’ll preserve your flesh and claim it for eternal life!” Qiu Jingming chuckled softly.

“Madness!” Their faces shifted as they realized Qiu Jingming’s terrifying method of immortality.

“Soul Cultivation!” Lu Tian suddenly recalled the secret of Soul Sealing Masters—absorbing other souls to nourish their own. And in the Underworld, souls were abundant!

“Why did you become like this?” Fu Xingyue asked, his face puzzled as he gazed at Qiu Jingming atop the mountain.

An Ascendant-level sage, one who could rival an era’s sovereign—none had ever seen such a being radiate pure evil, as if it were the embodiment of all malevolence.

“Sage? I sacrificed everything, yet failed to become an era’s sovereign because Master of Breaking Heaven still lived. I couldn’t bear it—I was left isolated in the Underworld, bound to my soul for eternity!” Qiu Jingming’s eyes burned with madness, his body radiating black mist as his face contorted.

“His mind has twisted!” Lu Tian sighed, pitying the grotesque Qiu Jingming.

“But why did he seal his own soul with flesh?” Fu Xingyue inquired.

“Perhaps when he was still sane, he foresaw this fate—more accurately, he sealed his soul himself!” Lu Tian sighed deeply, a hint of sorrow in his eyes.

What was meant to be the suppression of heaven and earth’s greatest sage had become a soul filled with resentment, ultimately sealed by its own hand.

“Could he have foreseen his fate? Soul Sealing Masters are truly terrifying!” Jin Ziyang and the others marveled. This Qiu Jingming must have been immeasurably powerful—only an era’s sovereign could have subdued him.

“Though not at its peak, I can still deal with you! Let my children play with you first—they’ve been sealed for too long!” Qiu Jingming smiled, his black hands moving swiftly. Black mist surged from his body.

The altar hummed as a divine seal was etched onto it, sending out a piercing resonance.

As the seal took hold, mournful cries echoed from beneath the ground, black mist rising in waves.

“Boom… boom…” The Soul Summoning Mountain erupted, as if opening hell’s gates. Waves of terrifying energy radiated from the ground, black clouds engulfing the heavens.

“Roar!” A massive black qilin emerged from the swirling mist, its roar filled with madness.

A piercing cry followed as a black three-legged golden crow appeared before Lu Tian’s group.

From the mist, eight ancient tribes’ soul warriors materialized—each radiating an aura of era’s peak.

“Damn! These are my clan’s ancestral souls!” Fu Xingyue’s group glared with fury, their teeth clenched.

“You have no idea how difficult it was to gather these ancient souls! I’ve only managed eight so far. Enjoy your fate—killing you would let your ancestors rest in peace, and I’d be doing humanity a favor!” Qiu Jingming smiled, addressing Lu Tian’s group.

“Wail…” More black残魂凝聚 into the sky, filling the heavens as they lunged at Lu Tian’s group with a deafening roar.

“Damn it!” Jin Ziyang grimaced, spitting out golden flames to incinerate the残魂.

Golden fire surged from Jin Ziyang’s control, instantly engulfing vast numbers of souls and surrounding Lu Tian’s group.

Yet the残魂 showed no will, attacking like suicide bombers without fear of death.

The golden flames were swiftly extinguished by the endless waves of black souls.

Lu Tian’s group felt as if they had plunged into an endless night, unable to see each other.

These souls were clearly cultivated by Qiu Jingming, even devouring their external soul senses.

“Fight!” Jin Ziyang roared, his body engulfed in golden flames as he plunged into the black souls. Countless souls were devoured by his fire.

Golden feathers transformed into sharp swords, slicing through the black souls as Fan Jingyu’s face turned grave.

The others also unleashed their attacks, eliminating the endless black souls. Though it seemed they were safe for now, they knew these残魂 were merely appetizers—eight era’s peak souls and Qiu Jingming atop the mountain were the true threats.

Lu Tian’s eyes glowed with violet light, piercing through the darkness to gaze at Qiu Jingming atop the mountain. He was puzzled—despite knowing he was a Soul Sealing Master, his soul was as insignificant as an ant before him. Even the eight era’s peak souls could not harm him. Yet why had he used his soul to attack them?

Lu Tian vanished like a ghost from their sight. If they saw this, they would be shocked—those souls had become docile after touching him.

“Soul Control!” Lu Tian’s hands moved, his gaze fierce as waves of invisible energy surged from him. A vast net of soul power erupted, enveloping the black souls.

“Buzz…” As the waves spread, the souls before him froze, then turned on their companions with a roar.

“What’s happening?” Jin Ziyang and the others, not far away, noticed the残魂’s change. The shift spread rapidly, reaching their vicinity within moments.

“Do we not need to fight?” Jin Ziyang and the others were stunned, unsure what to do. Yet they soon saw eight era’s peak souls charging toward them.

“Damn it! You forced us to kill our ancestors!” Fu Xingyue and Tu Feiyang glared with fury, but had no choice but to charge toward one of the peak souls.

“Soul Control—this is my old technique!” Qiu Jingming smiled atop the Soul Summoning Mountain, his hands moving swiftly. Invisible waves surged outward, submerging the black souls.

“Roar!” After Qiu Jingming’s soul power spread, the battling souls surged forward again, attacking Lu Tian’s group.

Moreover, after some time, the eight ancient tribes’ peak souls reached Fu Xingyue’s group.

“Don’t play like this!” Tu Feiyang shouted, caught off guard by the残魂 and wounded his soul.

“Kill…” Their faces turned grim, regrouping after the brief chaos.

“Soul Sealing Master vs. Soul Sealing Master?” Lu Tian stood behind them, his hands moving again.

Chapter 1497: Qiu Jingming Strikes

“Since I can’t control these souls, what about these?” Lu Tian’s eyes burned with battle intent as his hands moved swiftly. He pressed them onto the ground.

“Boom… boom…” The earth cracked, gray mist rising as it surrounded Lu Tian’s group.

“Damn! You’re giving us no escape!” Tu Feiyang and the others stared in shock at being flanked.

“Buzz…” The Star Moon Spear radiated brilliant light, protected by Fu Xingyue. The eight era’s peak souls and endless black残魂 surrounded it.

“Boom… boom…” The soul attacks were annihilated by the Star Moon Spear’s light, Fu Xingyue’s group stunned.

“Use the Star Moon Spear to destroy these!” Jin Ziyang murmured, watching the eight figures approach. They knew without it, they couldn’t withstand these souls.

“Wait a moment!” Fu Xingyue gazed at Lu Tian, his eyes filled with anticipation.

“Him?” Tu Feiyang and the others frowned, disbelieving. Though Lu Tian had once defeated an era’s peak soul with Fu Xingyue, they didn’t believe a mere early-era soul could match eight era’s peak.

Lu Tian ignored them, stepping out of the Star Moon Spear’s barrier. His gaze fierce.

“You have the残魂 of all tribes, and I have the残魂 of nine domains!” Lu Tian’s hands moved, waves spreading over the approaching gray残魂.

As the waves spread, nine domain’s残魂 surged with energy, attacking the black souls. Two bone-headed souls stepped forward, smashing into two era’s peak souls with their bone clubs.

“He can control these残魂!” Tu Feiyang and the others stared in awe at Lu Tian amidst the gray残魂, their eyes wide with shock. They hadn’t realized these残魂 were controlled by Qiu Jingming.

“Don’t just watch—take on the remaining peak souls!” Lu Tian knew this was critical. The remaining souls could change the battle’s outcome.

“Taking one should be manageable!” Fu Xingyue darted toward the Star Moon Clan’s peak soul.

Jin Ziyang and Tu Feiyang also found their targets, each facing an era’s peak soul. Fu Xingxuan remained by the Star Moon Spear, observing the battlefield to assist if anyone faltered.

“This is the real battle!” Lu Tian’s hands moved, his vast soul awareness spreading over countless残魂, clashing with the black tribes’ souls.

“Good!” Qiu Jingming smiled, his expression briefly tense before sending out invisible waves.

Two massive soul currents—black and gray—raced toward each other, colliding with a deafening roar.

One clash annihilated countless残魂, their cruelty leaving Lu Tian stunned.

“Forgive me—if I win, I’ll grant you peace!” Lu Tian whispered before fully commanding the endless残魂 to duel Qiu Jingming in an unconventional manner.

Soul Control, as its name suggests, involves commanding souls to fight for you. The cost is immense soul power—only Soul Sealing Masters with formidable souls can wield this soul-draining technique.

Lu Tian and Qiu Jingming stood amidst the soul horde, seemingly safe but both aware that a single defeat would leave their souls severely wounded.

“Match my soul power, and you’re still too young!” Qiu Jingming smiled, watching Lu Tian’s grim face.

Lu Tian’s soul was stronger than his peers, but against Qiu Jingming, the master of Soul Sealing, it was no match. The number of残魂 he controlled was double his own, leaving him at a severe disadvantage.

“I need to find a way out!” Lu Tian thought frantically, sensing countless gray残魂 being devoured by black ones. Though each loss was minor, the battlefield felt like a never-ending war, making him anxious.

“Yuan Ci Mountain!” Lu Tian’s eyes lit up, recalling the Yuan Ci Mountain—a treasure he had never used.

“You have a Soul Summoning Mountain, I have the Yuan Ci Mountain!” Lu Tian smiled, knowing Qiu Jingming’s methods couldn’t harm him.

The next moment, a black mountain appeared in Lu Tian’s hands, which he gently tossed into the sky.

“Boom… boom…” The mountain expanded under his control, becoming a colossal black mountain with radiant light from the Yuan Ci Spirit Light left by Lu Tian, Leng Qiuchan, and Jiang Sixi.

“I won’t be defeated by you!” Lu Tian smiled, commanding the残魂 to retreat.

“What is that?” Qiu Jingming’s face changed instantly upon seeing the Yuan Ci Mountain, his soul sensing a pull as if it could be devoured by the mountain.

“Go!” Lu Tian leapt onto the Yuan Ci Mountain, surrounded by white light.

“Buzz…” He pointed his finger, and a pure white light burst from the Yuan Ci Mountain, sweeping across the endless souls.

The white light radiated ultimate purification, annihilating vast numbers of black souls in an instant.

“Amazing!” Lu Tian was surprised—just one Yuan Ci Spirit Light had such power, destroying nearly a tenth of the black souls.

“Die!” Lu Tian, seeing success, moved his fingers rapidly, sending nine more Yuan Ci Spirit Lights toward the endless black souls.

“Damn it!” Qiu Jingming’s face darkened as he quickly withdrew his soul control over the black残魂. He knew these souls couldn’t resist the light’s power.

Nine Yuan Ci Spirit Lights illuminated the battlefield, like nine lightning bolts, instantly annihilating the remaining black souls.

“Roar…” The残魂 from nine domains howled, though soulless, they gazed at Lu Tian as if he were their master.

“This is a great treasure! I wish I hadn’t refined so many!” Lu Tian sighed, observing the remaining twenty Yuan Ci Spirit Lights on the black mountain.

With the black souls destroyed, only eight era’s peak souls and the black Soul Summoning Mountain remained.

“Kill!” Fu Xingyue held a crescent moon in his arms, striking the Star Moon Clan’s peak soul.

Tu Feiyang and the others fought desperately, unleashing their strongest techniques against the eight peak souls.

“Boom… boom… boom…” The earth trembled as powerful martial arts struck the massive souls.

“Leave it to me!” Lu Tian smiled, pointing his finger. The endless残魂 surged toward the eight peak souls.

Numerous ants can kill an elephant—countless gray残魂 overwhelmed the eight black peak souls, their cries echoing through the heavens.

Fu Xingyue’s group panted heavily, watching the eight peak souls being torn apart. Their eyes reflected admiration.

“Truly, one overcomes another—our attacks barely harm these eight souls, but these残魂 do!” Fu Xingyue marveled, watching the peak souls’ energy wane.

Though these残魂 could harm the eight peak souls, they were still era’s peak—despite their consciousness being taken by Qiu Jingming, they remained formidable. Each strike eliminated countless残魂.

“If this continues, even these残魂 could exhaust the eight peak souls—but we’d be left with nothing!” Lu Tian muttered, his face showing guilt. He moved his hands.

“Buzz…” The Yuan Ci Mountain thundered, its immense suction power pulling the eight souls.

The powerful suction twisted the eight peak souls, which resisted fiercely.

“You dare defy me!” Qiu Jingming’s eyes flashed with coldness, his body radiating an era’s sovereign aura. Fu Xingyue’s group paled.

“Soul Sealing Hand!” Qiu Jingming roared, his black hand凝聚 and striking toward Lu Tian’s group.

“Boom… boom…” Though a soul-formed hand, its power rivaled true martial arts, even surpassing them.

Chapter 1498: Supreme Power

The overwhelming aura made Fu Xingyue’s group tremble with fear, a feeling of being crushed. Only by activating the Star Moon Spear could they withstand it.

Lu Tian’s face was grim as he rushed in front of them, shouting: “Activate the Royal Weapon! I can’t hold it!”

No need for Lu Tian to speak. As he appeared beside them, Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingxuan, and Fu Xinyang unleashed radiant light into the Star Moon Spear.

The hum returned, as if stars descended, and divine light rained down, surrounding Lu Tian’s group.

“Crack…” As the barrier formed, Qiu Jingming’s black hand struck it.

The thunderous sound echoed through the heavens, shaking the Underworld. Lu Tian’s group stood pale and bloodied beneath the Star Moon Spear, their eyes filled with fear.

“Too strong!” Fu Xingyue wiped his bloodied lips, a sense of helplessness rising in their hearts. Even with the Star Moon Spear, they could barely protect themselves.

“If a single soul is this powerful, what would he be like with flesh? He might even surpass the three top sages of humanity!” Fu Xingyue’s group stared at Qiu Jingming above them, fear in their eyes.

“Royal Weapon!” Qiu Jingming smiled, gazing at the Star Moon Spear hovering above them. He moved his hands again.

“Unite to activate the weapon and kill him!” Fu Xingyue shouted, channeling his era power into the Star Moon Spear. They knew an Ascendant-level soul could not be matched.

Jin Ziyang and Tu Feiyang also poured their era power into the Star Moon Spear.

The hum returned, and under Fu Xingyue’s group’s combined effort, brilliant light erupted from the Star Moon Spear. It seemed like a supreme ruler awakening.

A golden figure, bathed in golden light, appeared before the Star Moon Spear, gripping it and illuminating the entire Underworld.

“Is this the revived Royal Weapon?” Qiu Jingming’s face turned serious, clearly wary of an era treasure.

The golden figure wasted no time, swinging the Star Moon Spear toward Qiu Jingming with a mighty strike.

“This figure must be the Star Moon Clan’s ruler!” Lu Tian was stunned, realizing that a revived Royal Weapon and an era treasure equaled the peak of a ruler or an era sovereign. This was why royal clans and figures like Gu Tianshi avoided using era treasures in battle.

Fu Xingyue’s group, now at the end of their era, could still fully revive the Royal Weapon.

“Boom… boom…” The thunderous sound shook the Underworld again, and the Star Moon Spear radiated with light, its power overwhelming. It struck Qiu Jingming like a ruler’s arm.

“Final Kill! Even if you’re an Ascendant, your fate is sealed before my clan’s supreme Royal Weapon!” Fu Xingyue sneered, gazing at Qiu Jingming, who radiated black mist.

The golden spear, loaded with pressure, swept across the heavens and appeared above Qiu Jingming in an instant.

“Ruler! You too had this power back then!” Qiu Jingming trembled under the overwhelming aura, his soul unable to resist.

Though trembling, Qiu Jingming had once been on the brink of enlightenment. Facing this overwhelming strike, he displayed madness.

“I’ll see how many times you can activate it!” Qiu Jingming moved his hands, and the Soul Summoning Mountain thundered. It instantly appeared above him.

“Soul Confinement of Ten Thousand Souls!” Qiu Jingming roared, etching divine seals onto the black Soul Summoning Mountain.

“Roar…” A deep growl echoed from the mountain, as black souls drifted out and fought among themselves, forming chains of divine inscriptions around it.

“His soul still survives!” Fu Xingyue’s group stared in disbelief, watching the souls emerge and feeling a bad premonition.

“This is his nurturing soul!” Lu Tian’s brow furrowed, observing the orderly souls forming divine chains.

“He’s invested heavily—these souls are carefully selected to nourish his soul!” Lu Tian murmured, gazing at Qiu Jingming with a darkened heart.

“Crack…” As they marveled, Qiu Jingming’s attack coalesced and collided with the Star Moon Spear.

The Underworld trembled, as if the heavens had shattered. Cracks spread from their collision, instantly sending Lu Tian’s group flying.

The world seemed to freeze, leaving only the violent震荡. The overwhelming waves annihilated all living beings around them, including the eight era’s peak souls that had been nearly devoured by残魂.

Annihilation—both the Star Moon Spear and Soul Summoning Mountain’s collision waves annihilated everything around them, including Qiu Jingming. He was reduced to a cloud of black mist, drifting in the heavens.

Lu Tian’s group stood pale, their eyes filled with shock. They hadn’t expected Qiu Jingming to dare withstand a ruler’s strike.

“Do you think he’s dead?” Fu Xinyang trembled, his voice filled with disbelief. Though they had seen Qiu Jingming turned into mist, they still doubted—his power and methods were unprecedented.

“Probably dead!” Jin Ziyang’s group looked at the Soul Summoning Mountain colliding with the Star Moon Spear, murmuring.

“Haha… The might of a royal ruler’s final strike is no more than this!” As they focused, a raspy voice echoed in their ears, causing their faces to change.

“He’s still alive!” Their eyes widened—how could he survive such a collision?

“Buzz…” The black Soul Summoning Mountain emitted more black mist, making Fu Xingyue’s group pale.

After the relentless battles and the Star Moon Spear’s strike, they were exhausted. They weren’t royal heirs, so using a Royal Weapon was not effortless—therefore, they couldn’t sustain another strike.
