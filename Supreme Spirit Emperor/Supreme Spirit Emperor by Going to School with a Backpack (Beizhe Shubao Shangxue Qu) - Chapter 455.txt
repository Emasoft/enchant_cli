“Indeed…” the crowd nodded in unison. Long You Ran’s words greatly inspired them, for she was the Lord of Long Yin City.

Time passed slowly. In the blink of an eye, Luo Tian had been in seclusion for ten days. Meanwhile, the people of the Tianyuan Sect continued their daily lives, though a shadow now loomed over them—the matter of Zhu Fenghuo’s elder brother. If the timeline was accurate, by the time the Tianmen Sect reached here, a Heavenly Immortal would be arriving.

“What is the Tianyuan Sect? Just a brash youth!” At that moment, five middle-aged men with overwhelming aura appeared beyond ten thousand feet of the Tianyuan Sect.

Their faces bore icy coldness, and oppressive pressure radiated from them—these were the lords of five major cities across ten thousand miles.

“Indeed, a band of robbers. How dare they call themselves a sect!” A burly man with a gleaming bald head, glaring under the sun, spoke coldly.

“Sun Luocheng, I heard those robbers stole your belongings,” a tall middle-aged man said with a smile, gazing at the bald-headed man.

“Yes. I’ll skin that kid alive!” Sun Luocheng’s eyes flashed with coldness. Even Zhu Fenghuo, with his connections, had not dared to openly rob Sun Luocheng.

“Stay calm. First, assess the situation. If he’s a disciple of some sect, he must know about Zhu Fenghuo’s elder brother. If he dares to openly claim this mountain, either he’s a fool or has someone behind him. Either way, we must tread carefully,” another voice cautioned.

“But if he dares to harm my daughter, I’ll fight him to the death!” Long Li muttered, his eyes sharp with coldness.

Zheng Tiande had returned some time ago, bringing news. Long Li also used special methods to contact friends along the way to Tianmen Sect, but none had heard of Long You Ran passing through. This convinced Long Li that she was still with Luo Tian.

As they spoke, the five city lords arrived at the borders of the Tianyuan Sect. The lords of ten thousand miles—none were unaware of their presence. Soon, the robbers on watch reported to the Tianyuan Sect.

“Second Lord, what should we do?” The robbers’ leaders, who had just left, regrouped in the hall. Their eyes turned to Long You Ran seated there.

“Long Yin City, Long Li, Luoshan City Sun Luocheng, Xiulong City Li XiuLong, Kuanglong City Zhang Kuanglong, Lieyang City Zhang Lie!” Long You Ran whispered the five names, her face etched with worry. She had no fear of Long Yin City, but the other four lords were no triflers. Their alliance to come here was surely not for peaceful reasons.

“Let’s go see,” Long You Ran donned the Thousand Illusions Mask, concealing her face. She adopted a cold demeanor, resembling a demon.

Long You Ran led the group to the mountain stronghold’s gate. Long Li and the five lords stood there, their faces grim.

“Ladies and gentlemen, what brings you to my Tianyuan Sect?” Long You Ran addressed the five lords. Though facing five masters, her heart trembled slightly, yet her expression remained calm.

“Mother Demon?” The lords’ faces darkened further. In their view, the mysterious Tianyuan Sect Master Luo Tian should have personally greeted them.

“Still playing enigmatic?” Sun Luocheng sneered internally. He took a step forward: “We’ve come to find your robbers’ leader. Let your master come out and meet us!”

“Our sect master is in the critical phase of seclusion. Please wait a few days,” Long You Ran replied.

“Where is my daughter?” Long Li spoke coldly, his gaze locked on Long You Ran. Though his tone was icy, upon seeing her, he could not summon anger.

“Lord Long, your daughter is indeed not within the Tianyuan Sect,” Long You Ran replied respectfully. After all, she was his daughter.

“Such a big attitude! Let that kid come out and meet us. Also, return the stolen goods. Otherwise, we’ll ‘cleanse’ you today!” Long You Ran’s words, heard by others, seemed to show weakness.

“Hearing that the second lord of the Tianyuan Sect, Mother Demon, is a heroine, today’s encounter confirms her reputation,” a soft voice chimed in. The speaker wore a blue robe, had an elegant bun, and was slender yet youthful. A scholarly aura radiated from her.

“Hand over that kid. Otherwise, we’ll tear down your sect!” a brash voice barked—Zhang Lie, who seemed more like a bandit than a lord.

“Our sect master is indeed in seclusion. As for the goods we’ve acquired, sorry—we’ve already consumed them,” Long You Ran shook her head gently, gazing at the four men.

“Do you think defeating Zhu Fenghuo grants you freedom?”

“Now, you have two choices: either let that Luo Tian come out and return the goods, and we’ll part amicably. Or we’ll destroy you!” Zhang Kuanglong’s eyes glinted with threat.

“You…” Long You Ran’s face changed instantly. This was a blatant threat.

Long You Ran was still just a girl, her strength lacking. Faced with the pressure of five men, she felt flustered.

“You what? I’ll count to ten. If that kid doesn’t come out, we’ll strike!” Zhang Lie barked.

“Ten…” Zhang Lie began counting. His gaze was icy, locking onto Long You Ran. Originally intending to probe the situation, they now had no restraint. Even if Luo Tian had connections, a strong dragon doesn’t dominate the local area. These city lords were no pushovers.

Long You Ran’s palms grew sweaty. She hadn’t expected them to be so bold, showing no intention of negotiation.

“Nine… eight… seven…” Sun Luocheng took over Zhang Lie’s count.

“Boom!” As Sun Luocheng’s words trailed off, a thunderous roar echoed overhead. Black storm clouds enveloped the entire mountain.

“Is this a heavenly tribulation?” The crowd gazed at the ominous clouds, eyes filled with confusion.

“Hum…” As they pondered, a golden sun rose atop the mountain, hovering in their sight.

“An elixir!” They soon recognized what the golden sun was.

“The Tianyuan Sect houses an alchemist!” The five lords’ faces shifted. Their gazes turned to the mountain’s peak.

“Crack!” A golden lightning dragon struck the elixir, creating waves. The radiant elixir’s light remained undimmed, as if bathed in golden thunder.

“This elixir still holds such power under the alchemical tribulation. It’s a Second Grade Immortal Rank Elixir!” Zhang Lie’s face bore disbelief, gazing at the elixir amidst thunder.

“Second Grade Immortal Rank Alchemist!” Long Li and the others’ faces shifted. They regretted their earlier harsh words. A Second Grade Immortal Rank Alchemist could change much—like Li XiuLong, the strongest among them. His city was their most powerful.

Li XiuLong’s face bore contemplation, his smile fading. His eyes turned serious.

“Not… could it be the Grand Master?” Not only did Long Li and the others shift, but even the Tianyuan Sect’s people, including Long You Ran, wore expressions of disbelief.

“Is our Grand Master a prodigy? Just days ago, he could only craft First Grade Immortal Rank Elixirs. Now, in a few days, he’s already making Second Grade!” The Tianyuan Sect’s people murmured.

“Crack!” As they marveled, the second alchemical tribulation struck the elixir.

A purple lightning dragon failed to move the golden elixir. In an instant, it vanished from sight.

“Two alchemical tribulations—confirmed! This is a Second Grade Elixir!” Long Li and the others’ eyes gleamed, gazing at the hovering elixir.

A flash of gold—Luo Tian appeared before the elixir, a smile on his face. He grabbed the golden elixir.

Chapter 1768: Misunderstanding

Luo Tian grasped the elixir, his gaze turning toward Long Li and the others. Then he plummeted to the ground—Luo Tian was still not a Heavenly Immortal.

Yet, his seclusion had yielded much. His body felt more complete, fully adapted to the Immortal Realm’s rules. A radiant aura flowed through him. He had emerged from seclusion because his cultivation had reached a plateau, and he had crafted this Second Grade Elixir—Breakthrough Elixir.

“Is that the Tianyuan Sect’s Grand Master?” Long Li and the others marveled, gazing at the brief appearance of Luo Tian. They admired his youth, unaware that this young man was a monster who had lived longer than them.

“What’s going on?” As Luo Tian landed, he approached Long You Ran and the others. His gaze held a hint of coldness—he sensed Long You Ran’s tension, realizing these old men had not come for tea.

“Lord Luo! Renowned in name, but even more so in person. I didn’t expect the Grand Master to be so young!” Li XiuLong smiled, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Grand Master!” Long You Ran sighed deeply. Upon seeing Luo Tian, her heart steadied. She recounted the events to him.

“You continue. I’ll see how you plan to destroy my Tianyuan Sect!” Luo Tian’s lips curled in mockery. He crossed his arms, gazing at Sun Lie and the others.

“Hmph…” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Sun Lie and the others’ faces darkened. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so bold. For a moment, they were speechless.

Previously, their strength was due to not considering Luo Tian’s alchemist identity. Now, seeing him with their own eyes, and his strength—when he gazed at them, they felt a chill and a strong sense of danger.

“Indeed, one who could defeat Zhu Fenghuo. So young with such achievements—there must be a major sect behind him!” They deduced, unable to fathom which clan could cultivate such a prodigy.

“Lord Luo, my daughter Long You Ran is in your sect. Please, for my sake, release her!” After a brief silence, Long Li spoke solemnly.

“Hmph…” Upon hearing Long Li’s words, Luo Tian’s expression froze. He gazed at Long You Ran—why hadn’t she revealed her identity? If she had, Long Li would have stood by her side.

Seeing Luo Tian gaze at her, Long You Ran shook her head. Her eyes held entreaty.

“Lord Long, my daughter is indeed here. However, I need to speak with you alone,” Luo Tian mused before addressing Long Li.

“Indeed here!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s confirmation, Long Li’s face darkened. His eyes flashed with murderous intent.

“I must see You Ran now!” Long Li barked, his voice resolute. His aura surged skyward, pressing toward Luo Tian.

Seeing Long Li confront Luo Tian, the other lords did not attack but stood by, waiting for developments. They had now seen Luo Tian’s strength.

“Lord Long… don’t misunderstand. I assure you, my daughter is unharmed and living well. Within three days, she will return safely to Long Yin City!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing Long Li.

“Living well!” Upon hearing this, Long Li’s eyes flashed with murderous intent. Though Luo Tian had said it casually, Long Li took it as an implication—this was a bandit’s den. To him, “living well” suggested his daughter had been defiled.

“I’ll fight you to the death!” Long Li’s eyes turned blood-red. He pushed off the ground, transforming into a whirlwind toward Luo Tian.

“Dragon Ascends to Heaven!” As he ran, Long Li’s hands formed seals. A dragon’s roar echoed as his aura surged.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian cursed, realizing his words had caused misunderstanding.

But before he could explain, Long Li was already at his side. A golden dragon enveloped Long Li, roaring toward Luo Tian.

“Divine Seal of the Dao!” Luo Tian had no choice. A golden fist shot out, colliding with the golden dragon.

“Roar…” Next moment, winds swirled. The golden dragon’s image shattered, and Long Li was hurled backward, his mouth bleeding.

As Long Li flew back, the other four lords’ eyes narrowed. They gazed at Luo Tian, who remained unmoved.

“Grand Master has grown stronger again. Is he about to ascend to Heavenly Immortal?” The Tianyuan Sect’s people bore reverence, unsurprised by Luo Tian’s victory. Their surprise was that he had remained unmoved.

“Lord Long, this is all a misunderstanding. Let me explain!” Luo Tian shouted. He knew Long Li was enraged; if he didn’t reveal Long You Ran, Long Li would keep fighting. If he were in Long Li’s position, he’d fight too.

“Is she your daughter, Long You Ran!” Luo Tian pointed at the stunned Long You Ran.

Long Li’s speed had been too fast. Even Luo Tian hadn’t time to explain. Long You Ran couldn’t either, watching Long Li and Luo Tian clash.

“Wha—!” Long Li halted mid-charge. His gaze turned to Long You Ran, who had removed the Thousand Illusions Mask.

“Nonsense!” Long Li cursed, his chest heaving. He spat out old blood—his daughter had truly angered him.

“Father…” Long You Ran licked her lips, stepping toward Long Li. She felt remorse for playing and causing him injury.

Luo Tian smiled. That punch had been held back—after all, she was his daughter.

“You… you…” Long Li gazed at Long You Ran, speechless. He pointed at her.

“Father, I’m sorry!” Long You Ran stood there, no longer the mischievous girl but a obedient daughter.

“Unexpectedly, the prodigy of Long Yin City is none other than the famed Mother Demon!” Zhang Lie sneered, his tone mocking.

“Respectful elder, don’t be angry,” Luo Tian stepped toward Long Li, placing an elixir in his mouth.

“Hmph…” Long Li glanced at Luo Tian before exhaling deeply. He bowed to Luo Tian: “Lord Luo, this was my recklessness. I apologize!”

“Lord Long, you’re too kind. We are friends. My daughter has helped greatly these days. I should be thanking you!” Luo Tian smiled, intercepting Long Li.

“Indeed, I’ve helped him a lot!” Long You Ran muttered beside Long Li.

“Nonsense!” Long Li glared at her, silencing her immediately.

“Respectful elder, don’t scold You Ran. In the future, if you need anything, just say so!” Luo Tian smiled at Long Li, though inwardly sighed—his work was far from over.

Though mischievous, Long You Ran had managed the hundreds of people in the Tianyuan Sect well.

Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Long Li’s eyes brightened. Luo Tian’s strength and alchemist status were worth befriending.

“Then I’ll visit often. When you have time, come to Long Yin City!” Long Li was skilled at socializing, calling Luo Tian “younger brother” to bridge their gap.

“Father…” Hearing Long Li’s words, Long You Ran protested. She disliked being a generation lower. But Long Li’s glare silenced her.

“Haha, Lord Luo, it’s a pleasure to meet. Since this was a misunderstanding, we’ll take our leave!” Zhang Lie and the others chuckled, rising to go.

“Did I say you could leave?” Before they turned, Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed in their ears. Their bodies halted.

“Lord Luo, what else do you need?” The four men asked, their gazes on Luo Tian.

“Who said they’d destroy my Tianyuan Sect? You may continue now!” Luo Tian’s eyes held mockery. They had dared to attack, and he wouldn’t let it slide.

“Lord Luo, what do you mean?” Li XiuLong smiled. Others feared Luo Tian’s alchemist status, but he didn’t care—his city had a Second Grade Immortal Rank Alchemist.

“Look at your men. They were frightened by you, affecting their cultivation. In the Immortal Realm, what matters most? Cultivation! If your men were harmed, would you not demand compensation?” Luo Tian gazed at the four.

“Damn it! You scared us. We did nothing!” They cursed internally but smiled outwardly.

“Lord Luo, I left in a hurry and had no gifts. When I return to Xiulong City, I’ll send something for you!” Li XiuLong smiled, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Playing games with me?” Seeing Li XiuLong’s demeanor, Luo Tian sneered inwardly.

Chapter 1769: The Shaking Heaven Brush

“Hmph. Lord Luo still wants to detain us?” Li XiuLong smiled, gazing at Luo Tian. He thought Luo Tian’s courage was limited—daring to attack five men.

“Then you’re mistaken!” Before Li XiuLong’s words ended, Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed behind him. Everyone was startled.

“Damn it!” Li XiuLong’s face darkened. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to break the rules, striking without warning.

Hastily, Li XiuLong punched. The clash with Luo Tian was inevitable. Yet the result was clear—his face twisted, feeling as if he’d struck iron. He was thrown backward.

“No compensation? Then stay!” Luo Tian sneered, his form like a ghost. He reappeared before Li XiuLong and grabbed him.

“You still want to play games?” Seeing Li XiuLong’s expression, Luo Tian sneered.

Chapter 1770: Fame Across Five Cities

“Why? Lord Luo still wants to detain us?” Li XiuLong smiled, gazing at Luo Tian. He thought Luo Tian’s courage was limited—daring to attack five men.

“Then you’re mistaken!” Before Li XiuLong’s words ended, Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed behind him. Everyone was startled.

“Damn it!” Li XiuLong’s face darkened. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to break the rules, striking without warning.

Hastily, Li XiuLong punched. The clash with Luo Tian was inevitable. Yet the result was clear—his face twisted, feeling as if he’d struck iron. He was thrown backward.

“You still want to play games?” Seeing Li XiuLong’s expression, Luo Tian sneered.
