“Damn it, I won’t come back unless I reach the Immortal King!” Sun Keinian shouted, his eyes filled with regret.

“Meng Xue, Ran Hao, you two follow them carefully. These young men are clearly troublemakers; prioritize your lives!” Meng Wushuang addressed Meng Xue and Ran Hao.

Ran Hao had become Meng Wushuang’s disciple. The Burial Palace in the desert was set up by Meng Wushuang to select disciples, and the coffin contained a Half-Step Immortal King he had once slain.

“Don’t worry, Father. You know my abilities!” Meng Xue said with excitement. She was also restless; if not for seeing Meng Wushuang alone in the Death Desert’s loneliness, she would have left long ago. Now that Gu Qianxue had stayed behind, she could go out and explore.

“Hmph,” Meng Wushuang nodded. He turned to Luo Tian, his voice cold: “If anything happens to my daughter, I won’t let you live.”

“Respectfully, as long as I’m alive, Meng Xue will be safe!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully.

“Go!” Meng Wushuang waved his hand, activating the transmission array. Luo Tian and the others vanished from sight.

……

The Desert Sea King City was bustling with activity. The vast city teemed with people, many of whom were sect disciples and elders. All sought one person—the killer of their sect’s ancestral descendants.

Yet the city's major factions ignored it, as it was none of their concern. However, the Zhao and Jiao families were furious. The Zhao family had once arranged a marriage with the Jiao family, but recently, Zhao Chenglong, Zhao’s genius, had been crushed to death.

This incident ignited Zhao’s anger, prompting them to send numerous strong warriors to hunt the killer. The perpetrator had entered the Death Desert with his forces, and no one had seen him since.

This incident left Zhao humiliated, and even Jiao felt the sting. But there was nothing they could do; entering the Death Desert, even a True Immortal Late Stage cultivator would struggle to find someone. Only an Immortal King could navigate it unscathed.

The Desert Sea King City had only one Immortal King—the founder of the Sand King Palace, Meng Wushuang.

At that moment, in the central hall of the Desert Sea King City stood a towering stone statue. It depicted a middle-aged man—Meng Wushuang himself.

This was the strongest faction in the city, ruling over the four major families. The Sand King Palace.

Outside the hall, two disciples stood idly, yawning as they guarded it. It was a轻松 job (easy task), for Meng Wushuang would contact the Sand King Palace’s elders through the statue when he had business.

Over the years, Meng Wushuang had only communicated with these elders five times. The disciples’ duty was to notify the Sand King Palace’s elders when the hall emitted fluctuations.

“Hum…” As the two disciples’ eyes drooped, about to fall asleep, a wave of fluctuations suddenly emanated from the hall. Wind howled, sweeping through the hall’s doors.

“Why is the wind so strong?” One disciple muttered, his gaze lazy.

“Is it a sandstorm? No… I feel some fluctuations coming from the hall. The wind is also blowing out of it!” The other disciple shrugged, his words trailing off as both suddenly realized something.

“Fluctuations in the hall! Oh my god!” They shouted in unison, then grabbed their jade talismans and crushed them.

At the moment of crushing the talisman, all the Sand King Palace’s strength trembled. Their eyes widened in disbelief as they rose from their quarters.

In an instant, a group of figures leapt forth. Three elders stood at the forefront, their eyes sharp with intensity.

These three were the strongest in the Desert Sea King City—True Immortal Peak cultivators Shao Honglang, Xu Yongshan, and Chen Zhenhai.

Behind them stood dozens of figures. The weakest among them was a True Immortal Mid-Stage, nearly fifty in total.

“Respect the Deputy Sect Leader! Greetings to all elders!” The two disciples immediately knelt, their gazes respectful and avoiding direct eye contact.

“What’s going on?” Shao Honglang addressed the two disciples, his gaze turning to the hall.

“Just now, there were fluctuations in the hall. And wind sounds!” One disciple stammered.

“Where did the fluctuations come from? Are you playing with us?” Another True Immortal Peak elder snapped, his gaze turning to the hall.

At that moment, the hall was eerily calm. There were no fluctuations—unlike when Meng Wushuang had given instructions before.

“Disciples dare not lie. There were definitely fluctuations!” The two disciples broke out in cold sweat, defending themselves loudly.

“We’ll go check. If there are no fluctuations, you two will face punishment!” Shao Honglang’s group spoke, their voices laced with impatience.

“Don’t worry. No one dares to harm you in the Desert Sea King City. I’ll take you for a ride and show you around. In the Death Desert, I was really stifled!” Just as they were about to enter the hall, a voice echoed from within.

“Ran Hao, you are at least my father’s disciple. What the hell is this Jiao family? I’ll send people to snatch that Jiao Lu for you right now!” A bold female voice made Shao Honglang’s group pale.

“Who dares to cause trouble in my Sand King Palace!” Shao Honglang’s face darkened as he strode to the hall’s entrance, pushing open the heavy doors.

“Clang…” The heavy door slammed open in his anger.

“Damn it… who the hell is this!” As the door opened, two shouts echoed clearly in their ears.

As the door swung open, Shao Honglang’s group saw the scene inside. Their brows twitched, and their mouths twitched.

Two figures lay on the ground—one plump, one thin. Both clutched their noses, tears streaming down their faces. A sturdy figure stood behind them, carrying a large sword, his short hair giving him the look of a tomboy.

The woman’s figure was already strong, but beside her stood an even more robust giant. His sheer physique exuded pressure, like a black tower. Luo Tian and Ran Hao looked relatively normal.

“Uncle Shao, Uncle Chen, Uncle Xu. Long time no see!” Meng Xue smiled as she stepped forward toward Shao Honglang’s group.

“Little Xue!” Seeing Meng Xue, the three elders sighed in relief, their eyes softening.

The people behind them also smiled slightly. Though Meng Wushuang rarely appeared, Meng Xue often visited the Desert Sea King City.

“Ugh, what’s with this girl? You’re back again?” Xu Yongshan smiled indulgently at Meng Xue.

“I guess my father doesn’t want me anymore. He kicked me out, hahaha!” Meng Xue laughed loudly before turning to introduce the three elders to Luo Tian.

“Uncle Shao, this is my friend, Luo Tian!”

“These three are my father’s brothers—life-and-death companions. You must flatter them well; the Desert Sea King City is under their control!” Meng Xue addressed Shao Honglang’s group and Luo Tian.

Chapter 1970: Thunderous Lightning (Jiao Lei)

The Desert Sea King City—Jiao Family.

As one of the four major families, the Jiao family’s power was considerable. Yet everyone in the Desert Sea King City knew their plight: no outstanding geniuses among their descendants.

Jiao Lei, the Jiao family’s patriarch and a True Immortal Late Stage cultivator, held high status in the city. However, his offspring were all failures. He had three sons, but they were all纨绔 (luxurious and idle). The eldest was still a Half-Step True Immortal, achieving nothing. Jiao Lei was deeply disappointed.

Disappointed, he placed his hopes on his grandchildren. Yet he had five grandsons—each as lazy and unambitious as their fathers, even worse than his sons.

Fathers were heroes; sons were cowards. Though people didn’t say it openly, they whispered behind his back, making the Jiao family a laughingstock.

The only thing that gave Jiao Lei some comfort was his granddaughter, Jiao Lu. She was intelligent and had reached the Heavenly Immortal Late Stage at a young age.

But being female, she couldn’t lead the family without resistance. Thus, Jiao Lei sought marriage alliances. Unlike the Jiao family, the other three families had young geniuses. He approached them to arrange marriages—children would take the Jiao surname, essentially seeking a son-in-law.

The Lin and Chen families rejected it outright. The Zhao family agreed, marrying Zhao Chenglong into the Jiao family. Though a son-in-law was humiliating, Zhao Chenglong remained part of the Zhao family—benefiting both families. The Jiao and Zhao families were weaker among the four major families.

But who could have imagined that Zhao Chenglong was crushed to death by a few kicks? Both the Zhao and Jiao families were furious.

At that moment, in the Zhao family’s hall, an elder and a middle-aged man sat. One was Jiao Lei, the other Zhao Tianping, the Zhao family’s patriarch.

“Elder Jiao, my Zhao family can find another genius to marry into the Jiao family!” The middle-aged man spoke respectfully, his rank lower than Jiao Lei by one generation.

“Let’s discuss it carefully,” Jiao Lei shook his head gently, gazing at Zhao Tianping with a sigh. He envied the son who had achieved something; he wouldn’t be having this conversation with Zhao Tianping.

The Zhao family’s descendants had only two notable ones: Zhao Chenglong and Zhao Chengfeng. Zhao Chenglong was decent, but Zhao Chengfeng surpassed him vastly. Even among the four major families of the Desert Sea King City, Zhao Chengfeng was a prodigy, called a prodigy.

The Zhao family could have married Zhao Chenglong into the Jiao family because of Zhao Chengfeng. Without Zhao Chengfeng, they wouldn’t have agreed to the marriage.

“Alright, Elder Jiao, consider it carefully,” Zhao Tianping smiled slightly, addressing Jiao Lei. His eyes held confidence; everyone knew the Jiao family’s sons and grandsons.

If the Jiao family were truly entrusted to those weaklings, it would be erased from the Desert Sea King City within a decade. He was certain Jiao Lei would eventually give in.

……

At that moment, Luo Tian and the others stood at the Jiao family’s gate, their faces filled with admiration.

“Hmph… is this Jiao family so grand?” Sun Keinian spoke, gazing at the imposing gate.

“Ran Hao, don’t be nervous. I’ll protect you,” Meng Xue patted Ran Hao’s shoulder with boldness.

Luo Tian, however, was filled with admiration as he looked at Ran Hao. They had come without Shao Honglang’s group, hoping to get a genuine answer from Ran Hao.

“Announce that we seek an audience with your family’s patriarch!” Sima Tuo shouted, his eyes gleaming.

“Smack…” Sun Keinian slapped Sima Tuo’s head, shouting, “What are you thinking? This might be one of our own. Don’t act so foolish!”

“But if they aren’t, we could plan something,” Sima Tuo’s words made Luo Tian and the others’ mouths twitch.

“Who are you?” Two Jiao family youths asked, their auras strong enough to make the two cautious.

“Him. You don’t know him?” Sun Keinian pointed at Ran Hao, addressing the two gatekeepers.

“Ran Hao!” The two youths scrutinized Ran Hao and gasped. They hadn’t expected him to appear here.

Ran Hao had been expelled from the Jiao family for seducing the daughter. Everyone in the Jiao family knew about it.

“Ran Hao, why are you back?” One gatekeeper shouted, clearly having a good relationship with Ran Hao before.

“Liu Tian, report it!” Ran Hao clenched his fists, responding to the youth. Now that he was higher than Jiao Lei’s status, his mindset had changed slightly.

“Hmph. You really think you’re something? Just bring a few people and dare to cause trouble in the Jiao family?” The other gatekeeper sneered, mocking him.

“You’re nothing!” Sun Keinian shouted. They had a protector now; they wouldn’t fear anyone, so he pulled out a shovel and swung it at the youth’s head.

“Smack…” The clear sound echoed. The youth was sent flying, crashing into the Jiao family’s gate.

“You… you…” The youth fell to the ground, his head cracked open, blood spewing as he pointed at Sun Keinian incoherently.

“Liu Tian, report it!” Ran Hao ordered Liu Tian, his voice now calmer.

“Okay…” Liu Tian didn’t dare to delay. He felt something big was about to happen and hurriedly stepped out of the gate.

As Luo Tian’s group caused a commotion, people on the street turned their eyes to the Jiao family, puzzled.

“Who are these people? They’re so bold in causing trouble at the Jiao family’s gate. This isn’t giving the Jiao family any face, is it?”

“You don’t know? That person is named Ran Hao. He was once a servant in the Jiao family, with good talent but seduced the daughter and was expelled!” People whispered.

“But who are those young men with him? Are they disciples from a major sect?” Then people turned their eyes to Luo Tian’s group, assuming Ran Hao had found protection.

“That big guy… that big guy isn’t the one who crushed Zhao Chenglong and was being chased?” Chen Zhanbiao’s towering figure immediately caught people’s attention, shouting loudly.

“He returned and was so showy. Who gave him the guts? And where are Zhao family’s strong warriors?”

“No one returned!” People quickly realized the scene of Zhao family’s massive pursuit of Chen Zhanbiao, their eyes filled with disbelief.

“Ah, it’s Ran Hao. How dare you return?” A lazy voice echoed from the gate as five youths with playful eyes stepped out.

These were Jiao family’s descendants—Jiao Lu’s brothers. Their steps were light, and they stepped outside the gate.

“You servant! You haven’t suffered enough yet? What do you want? Guards, seize him!” One youth shouted, and three True Immortal Peak disciples and over a dozen True Immortal Late Stage disciples emerged.

“Yes!” A group of guards surrounded Luo Tian’s group. Some had complex expressions, others mocked him. Ran Hao had once been one of them; now he was in this situation.

“Don’t fight. You’re the star today. Leave it to us!” Luo Tian patted Ran Hao’s shoulder, smiling at him.

“Three True Immortal Peak disciples are mine. The rest are yours. How about that?” Luo Tian addressed them.

“Don’t move, leave it to me. I’ve been stifled!” Before Sun Keinian and others could speak, Meng Xue stepped forward, drawing her sword and rushing toward the Jiao family’s guards.

“Boom…” A thunderous sound echoed. Meng Xue ran like a fierce dragon, shaking the ground.

“Smack…” Before people could react, Meng Xue’s body crashed into a True Immortal Late Stage guard.

“Yelp…” A scream echoed, and then another. That guard was sent flying with several others, collapsing on the ground without getting up.

“Is this even a person?”

“Only Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao’s flesh-and-blood could match her!” Sun Keinian trembled as he watched Meng Xue, who was swinging her sword and attacking a True Immortal Peak disciple.

“Go… find your grandfather…” Several of Jiao Lu’s brothers nearly wet themselves, fleeing into the courtyard.

No need for the youths to find them; Jiao Lei and Zhao Tianping also arrived at the gate, hearing the thunderous sounds. Jiao Lei’s brows furrowed.

“Elder Jiao, it seems the Jiao family has trouble,” Zhao Tianping smiled slightly.

“It’s just a small problem. I’ll deal with it!” Jiao Lei’s eyes deepened, gazing at Meng Xue’s fierce aura. His eyes flickered slightly.

“Smack…” A clear sound echoed as the broad sword back struck a True Immortal Peak disciple’s back.

“Spit…” That disciple spat blood, being smashed into the ground by overwhelming force.

“Stop!” Jiao Lei shouted, his True Immortal Late Stage aura exploding. His face darkened as he saw his grandsons running toward him, terrified.

“Grandfather, kill them! That’s Ran Hao. He came to cause trouble!” One youth shouted, his voice trembling.

“An absolute gem…” Luo Tian and the others twitched their mouths as they watched Jiao Lei’s grandsons, then turned their eyes to Jiao Lei.

Chapter 1971: You Truly Don’t Know ()

“Ran Hao?” Hearing his useless grandson’s words, Jiao Lei furrowed his brows slightly. He had heard of Ran Hao’s story; he hadn’t expected a servant to stir up such a storm.

“Who are you? What do you want at my Jiao family? If you don’t explain clearly, I won’t be kind!” Jiao Lei shouted, his voice filled with authority.

“We just want to see Jiao Lu and ask her some questions!” Luo Tian stepped forward, addressing Jiao Lei.

“Indeed, it’s for Jiao Lu!” Jiao Lei sighed inwardly. If not for the marriage alliance, he wouldn’t have interfered with Jiao Lu’s marriage. But there was no choice; for the sake of the entire Jiao family, he had to sacrifice Jiao Lu.

“Ran Hao, you still haven’t given up?” Jiao Lei’s eyes were deep as he addressed Ran Hao standing there.

“Correct, I haven’t. For the past few months in the Desert Sea King City, I’ve lived like a dog, surviving by guiding people into the dangerous Death Desert. I did this to one day become strong enough and personally visit her, asking her!” Ran Hao’s eyes showed determination, his fists clenched as he gazed at Jiao Lei.

“You’ve insulted me and oppressed me. That’s fine, I just want to see Jiao Lu myself and have her tell me she abandoned me. Only then will I give up!” Ran Hao trembled, recalling his recent experiences.

“Insulted you? Oppressed you?”

“When did that happen? I only had you expelled from the Jiao family. I didn’t trouble you too much!” Jiao Lei’s face darkened, his gaze turning to the Jiao family members who had emerged.

Among those seen by Jiao Lei were several people who lowered their heads, including his useless grandson.

“Hmph. This old man is actually quite upright,” Sun Keinian muttered, looking at Jiao Lei.

Luo Tian also nodded. They hadn’t needed to intimidate him; it seemed Jiao Lei was quite reasonable. If Jiao Lu truly wanted to be with Ran Hao, then revealing Meng Wushuang’s disciple status would solve everything.

“Elder Jiao, please have Jiao Lu come out. I just want to ask her a few questions. No matter the result, we’ll apologize to you!” Luo Tian shouted. Since Jiao Lei was reasonable, they had to give him the respect he deserved; their commotion at the gate was indeed their fault.

“Let me say, find those uncles and just snatch her!” Meng Xue shouldered her sword, scoffing.

“Indeed, they have a background,” hearing Meng Xue’s words, Jiao Lei felt puzzled. He looked at Luo Tian’s group; after all, the Desert Sea King City was a time of unrest with sect disciples and elders present.

“Alright, then let you give up!” Jiao Lei shook his head slightly, instructing the clan: “Bring out Lu.”

“Grandfather!” As Jiao Lei’s words finished, a figure hurriedly stepped out from the crowd, breathing heavily.

A pointed face, yellow long dress, a slender figure with black hair cascading over her shoulders. She wore light makeup, her eyes flashing with anxiety. When she saw Ran Hao, her gaze flickered slightly, but Luo Tian noticed the woman exhaling relief.

“She has some beauty, but she still falls short compared to your wife!” Sun Keinian and Sima Tuo sneered.

“Jiao Lu!” Seeing the woman, Ran Hao’s face immediately tensed, but his eyes never left her.

“Lu, Ran Hao has something to say. He’ll leave after that!” Jiao Lei’s eyes showed affection as he addressed Jiao Lu.

“Ran Hao, what do you want to say?” Jiao Lu didn’t dare meet Ran Hao’s gaze, her eyes looking elsewhere.

“Do you like me?” Ran Hao asked directly, gazing at Jiao Lu with a hint of nervousness.

“Just ask that?” Hearing Jiao Lei’s words, people around laughed, looking at Ran Hao as if he were a fool.

“You…” Jiao Lu hadn’t expected Ran Hao to ask this question. There was no scolding, no anger.

“Correct, I want to ask that. Answer honestly—do you like me or not? If you do, today I’ll take you away. No one can stop us!” Ran Hao gazed at Jiao Lu with unwavering confidence, an aura of self-assurance surrounding him.

“Young man, don’t be arrogant. The Jiao family in the Desert Sea King City isn’t someone you can just cause trouble with!” Hearing Ran Hao’s words, Jiao Lei’s face turned angry.

“You can’t decide whether to cause trouble or not. If I want to, I could pierce the sky of the Desert Sea King City!”

“No, for you, I am the sky of the Desert Sea King City!”

“And from today on, my younger brother Ran Hao will also be an unreachable existence for you!” Meng Xue replied boldly, her voice making the surrounding people gasp.

“Arrogant!”

“Pretentious!”

“Who are these young men?” Hearing Meng Xue’s words, the surrounding people erupted in chatter.

“Ha! It’s been years since I met such arrogant young men. Are you from the Nine Immortal Mountains?” Zhao Tianping laughed loudly, his eyes filled with disdain. He was simply fed up.

“Don’t like!” Jiao Lu hesitated, glanced at Ran Hao’s group, then spoke softly.

“Go away. I was just deceived by you before!” Cold words came from Jiao Lu’s mouth, instantly making Ran Hao pale.

Luo Tian also felt a shock. He thought of Chen Yunting in Feiyun, who had been equally cold and indifferent, as if she had changed completely.

“Cough… cough…” Ran Hao coughed violently, blood flowing from his mouth. His entire body seemed to lose its soul.

“Haha! Did you hear that? Don’t delude yourself!” The Jiao family’s people saw Ran Hao coughing blood and laughed loudly.

“Louse dreaming of swan meat. Thinking you found some prodigies to back you up, you think you can run wild? This is Elder Jiao’s generosity. If it were anyone else, they would have been beaten to death!” The surrounding crowd also sneered.

Jiao Lei’s face showed satisfaction. He looked at Jiao Lu; others didn’t know, but he did. During the days Ran Hao was expelled, Jiao Lu had been憔悴 (worn out) for many days.

But Jiao Lei knew that Jiao Lu was responsible. For the family, she would choose sacrifice.

“Damn it! Don’t take it for granted. You don’t even like my younger brother. Wait until tomorrow, I’ll bring people to destroy you! I’m so angry!” Meng Xue shouted loudly, pulling Ran Hao away.

“Wait!” As Meng Xue pulled Ran Hao to leave, Luo Tian stopped her.

“Ran Hao, this isn’t what you think. Jiao Lu probably fears for your safety!” Luo Tian’s face was complex. He had a 70% chance that Jiao Lu, like Chen Yunting before, chose this way to protect Luo Tian’s safety.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Ran Hao was momentarily stunned. Jiao Lei’s face also changed slightly, his gaze turning to Luo Tian. He realized now that this young man was the leader.

“Rude! I want to see how you’ll destroy us!” Jiao Lei shouted, his eyes cold.

“Where? Where is the killer who killed my son Zhao Chenglong!” Before Jiao Lei’s words finished, people in the crowd became chaotic. A group of figures rushed out.

“Why are you here?” Zhao Tianping frowned slightly, this was the Jiao family’s gate. If things went wrong, it would be hard to handle.

“Elder Brother, that tower-like big guy is the killer who killed my son Zhao Chenglong!” A middle-aged man, resembling Zhao Chengping, stepped out of the crowd. His gaze turned to Chen Zhanbiao, who had said little.

“What!” Hearing the man’s words, Jiao Lei and Zhao Tianping’s faces changed instantly into endless anger.

“You’ve got guts. Truly, truly! I didn’t expect you to dare come to my Jiao family!” Jiao Lei shouted angrily.

“Elder Jiao, I’ll take them. I want to catch them and dismember them!” Zhao Tianping’s face darkened.

“Don’t, Grandfather. Let go of Ran Hao!” But Jiao Lu, who had been silent, suddenly shouted and stepped in front of Jiao Lei.

“Lu, move aside. Even if I let them go, the Zhao family won’t!” Jiao Lei addressed Jiao Lu.

“Correct. No one has ever killed a Zhao family member without paying the price. Even if you are sect disciples, it won’t help. This is the Desert Sea King City. Unless you’re from the Sand King Palace, no one can save you!” Zhao Tianping’s aura surged, pressing toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Did you hear? I was right. She did it to protect you!” Luo Tian sighed, addressing Ran Hao.

“We are indeed from the Sand King Palace!”

“Ran Hao, he is the Desert Sea King City’s ruler and the Sand King Palace’s sect leader, Meng Wushuang. This is his daughter!” Luo Tian saw Zhao Tianping about to attack and shouted loudly.

“Haha, the Sand King Palace. My Zhao family has been in the Desert Sea King City for years, serving the Sand King Palace. How could we not know who is in it!” Zhao Tieping and his people scoffed.

“Boom…” Zhao Tieping directly attacked, a hand of True Immortal power凝聚 (concentrated), pressing toward Luo Tian’s group.

“You truly don’t know!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly, feeling waves in the void.

Chapter 1972: The Hope of Guiyuan Sect

“Boom…” A hand of True Immortal power pressed toward Luo Tian’s group, causing people around to be surprised.

“Dare to kill!”

“These young men clearly have a sect behind them. Zhao family’s patriarch didn’t care at all!”

“What if they do? Unless it's one of the Nine Immortal Mountains, no sect in the Middle Heaven would dare to cause trouble in the Desert Sea King City. If those sects retaliate, the Sand King Palace will handle it!” People whispered.

“Elder, should we stop them?” In the crowd stood three figures. Two middle-aged men looked anxious.

“Not yet. This is the Desert Sea King City; it’s not good to quarrel with Zhao family!” The elder spoke.

“But if that boy is killed, our efforts would be in vain. We spent a lot to have the Seer calculate his whereabouts! We wanted one chance for Guiyuan Sect!” The two men looked anxious.

They were from the Guiyuan Sect, coming for Luo Tian. The Struggle for Heaven War was approaching, and the Guiyuan Sect was tense. Their high-level strength had been nearly wiped out.

To save the Guiyuan Sect in the Struggle for Heaven War, they had thought of the sect elders who had chased Luo Tian. If they could help them find and capture Luo Tian, those sects would be grateful. Then, with one or two True Immortal Peaks helping in the Struggle for Heaven War, the Middle Heaven sects would surely lose.

Thus, the Guiyuan Sect had spent everything to get the Seer’s five-year life in exchange for Luo Tian’s accurate information. They had sent one True Immortal Late Stage and two True Immortal Initials to kill Luo Tian.

“Who dares to harm our Sand King Palace’s young master?” Just as the golden True Immortal power hand pressed down, a cold and authoritative voice echoed in the world.

The voice caused Zhao Tianping’s hand to shatter instantly. At the same time, a powerful pressure spread through the void. A massive rift appeared, and three elders stepped out.

The three elders’ auras were overwhelming. Their eyes coldly gazed at Zhao Tianping and Jiao Lei, and as they appeared, a group of onlookers and members from the Zhao and Jiao families trembled. Even Jiao Lei and Zhao Tianping were included.

“Who dares to harm our Sand King Palace’s young master?” The three elders hadn’t finished speaking when another voice echoed from the void. A group of figures stepped out, their auras strong and eyes cold. Though their voices seemed casual, everyone heard the powerful killing intent.

“Grandfather… who are they…” Jiao Lei’s grandsons fell to the ground, trembling as they asked Jiao Lei. Three of them even wet their pants.

“Respect the three deputy sect leaders!” Jiao Lei and Zhao Tianping spoke simultaneously, their voices respectful. The four major families were strong in the Desert Sea King City, even looking down on other sects. This was because the Sand King Palace was their support.

The four major families’ relationship with the Sand King Palace was one of dependence. The Sand King Palace would still be the Sand King Palace without the four major families, but if the Sand King Palace fell, the four major families would also suffer.

“Deputy sect leaders! The deputy sect leaders of the Sand King Palace!”

“They are behind the Sand King Palace’s strength. My god, True Immortal Peak—three deputy sect leaders of such high status appeared here?”

“Almost all the Sand King Palace’s elders were present. Is that the刑堂 elder (Disciplinary Hall Elder)?” The onlookers trembled, their hearts surging with waves. They gazed at the people standing in the sky.

“Wait, the deputy sect leader just said ‘young master’! Those young men are truly from the Sand King Palace!” Soon, people saw Luo Tian’s group standing calmly.

“Uncle Shao, Uncle Chen, why are you here?” Meng Xue frowned slightly. She hadn’t told Shao Honglang to follow.

Luo Tian also looked at the people standing in the sky with disbelief. This force could scare anyone to death.

Luo Tian knew Shao Honglang’s group would be worried about Meng Xue’s safety and secretly follow or send strong warriors. After all, although Meng Xue was powerful, the Desert Sea King City had mixed elements; conflicts might arise. No one knew Meng Xue’s identity except the Sand King Palace, and if an accident happened, they might not arrive in time to rescue.

But Luo Tian hadn’t expected them to make such a big scene, almost sending everyone out.

“To let all the people in the Desert Sea King City know Meng Xue’s identity!” But then Luo Tian realized their intention—that was to intimidate, to show the entire Desert Sea King City’s forces that the Sand King Palace valued Meng Xue. Anyone who harmed Meng Xue would be doomed, making everyone know that Meng Xue was untouchable.

“Backed by a big tree, it’s easy to rest. Our old man just left us alone! People are jealous!” Sun Keinian and Sima Tuo looked enviously at Meng Xue.

“Ah-choo…” In the crowd, an elder sneezed, his gaze turning to Sun Keinian and Sima Tuo with anger.
