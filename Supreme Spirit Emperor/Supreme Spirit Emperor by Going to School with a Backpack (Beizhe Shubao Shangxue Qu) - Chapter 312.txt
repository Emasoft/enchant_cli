“Luo Xiong, please visit my First Island to chat for three days and nights. I heard you defeated Hu Tianzong, let’s discuss cultivation matters!” Guan Xingjian extended the invitation.

“Guan Xiong, I have other matters to attend to. I must leave for a while, so this time is not possible!” Luo Tian’s face showed reluctance as he directly refused.

“If that’s the case, I won’t disturb you further. But after returning, Luo Xiong must visit me at the First Island!” Guan Xingjian’s expression turned solemn, then he departed.

Luo Tian’s lips curled as he watched Guan Xingjian leave. He wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, inwardly sighing: “This Qixing Island must be left. I’m certain Guan Xingjian will uncover the truth within a day. If he realizes, he’ll definitely seek revenge!”

Luo Tian recalled Guan Xingjian’s sudden prostration. If it hadn’t happened, things would’ve been manageable. But with that bow, the enmity had truly deepened.

“Those old men—Tong Yangjian and others—are meddling!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly. They were old enough, yet still lacked foresight.

“This kid really knows how to play the part. If I hadn’t known about the past, I might’ve taken him for a selfless man!” Tong Yangjian sighed. He hadn’t anticipated the situation spiraling further into chaos.

Luo Tian wasted no time, entering Shen Gongfu’s courtyard under the respectful gazes of disciples from the Third Island.

“Island Master, I’ve left this sword here. I must leave the Third Island for a while. I’ll find Shen Gongfei!” Luo Tian appeared above Shen Gongfu’s courtyard, waved his hand, and instantly sent the Starry Sword into the courtyard. Before he finished speaking, Luo Tian’s figure had already appeared at the edge of the Third Island—the very place he’d just landed.

Luo Tian grabbed a green jade pendant, which emitted a soft emerald glow to shield him as he plunged into the array brimming with killing intent.

“Damn that kid!” Shen Gongfu’s face paled upon seeing the Starry Sword in his courtyard. After hearing Luo Tian’s words, he coldly smiled: “My nephew, I’ll find him myself. Do you think I need your help!”

Shen Gongfu naturally couldn’t leave the Starry Sword as a hot potato. He immediately sent it to Tong Yangjian, who also vanished from the Third Island with the jade pendant.

As for Shen Gongfu’s actions, Luo Tian didn’t know. But he could already imagine the scene of Guan Xingjian seeking revenge after discovering the truth.

Luo Tian wasn’t afraid of Guan Xingjian, but he had already planned to leave Qixing Island. He preferred to avoid unnecessary conflicts, unwilling to waste time on futile battles.

Through the array’s overwhelming killing intent and illusions, Luo Tian finally emerged onto the sea surface of Qixing Island, his face filled with admiration.

Instead of searching for beasts in the Seven Star Sea, he directly appeared on the land of the蛮族 (Barbarian Clan). Upon landing, he took off the Thousand Mirage Mask and placed it on his face.

As soon as the mask merged with his face, Luo Tian’s aura changed. The mask made his face appear extraordinarily handsome, especially his eyes—one like a full moon, the other like stars. To outsiders, he resembled an authentic Star-Moon Clan member, and his bloodline power was identical to that of the Star-Moon Clan.

“Truly amazing mask! Now no one will recognize me, right?” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with amusement as he examined his reflection. He strode toward the direction of the Wilderness City.

Luo Tian had planned to disguise himself as a Star-Moon Clan member. Since the Star-Moon Clan’s eyes were their only distinguishing feature, he decided to imitate them.

Luo Tian wore a look of anticipation, hoping for gains in the Wilder City. More importantly, he hoped to use the city’s gateway to the Nine Domains to return to the Nine Domains and find Shen Gongfei.

The Wilder City was the heart of the Barbarian Clan’s land. It was vast, not only inhabited by the Barbarians but also other Ancient Kings who had stationed there. Luo Tian’s speed allowed him to reach the city’s outskirts within a day.

As he gazed at the imposing Wilder City, observing the towering Barbarian giants around him and realizing none had detected his disguise as a Star-Moon Clan member, he smiled and stepped into the city.

The Wilder City surpassed South Ridge Stone寨 (Stone寨) in grandeur. Though built entirely of stone, it was exquisitely crafted with intricate patterns on its walls and buildings. A strange aura permeated the structures, giving an impression of unshakable strength.

Luo Tian walked along the impossibly wide streets, observing the grand hall at the city’s center radiating overwhelming power. The Barbarians around it showed reverence, and Luo Tian deduced this must be the core of the Wilder City—the Sacred God Hall.

“Who are you serving? Who sent you to wander through the Wilder City?” As Luo Tian marveled, several massive figures blocked his path. Their eyes bore authority as they scrutinized him, causing the surrounding Barbarians to respectfully gaze at them.

“Old friend!” Luo Tian turned, inwardly chuckling but outwardly showing deference: “I am a humble Star-Moon Clan member who accidentally entered an abyss and was teleported here.”

Chapter 1284: The Conflict Among Ancient Kings

Because of the Thousand Mirage Mask, Luo Tian’s displayed cultivation was merely late-stage Sage. In the Barbarian Clan’s land, this wasn’t remarkable—Luo Tian had planned it this way. Early in the era, standing out would draw too much attention; being a Sage avoided that.

Luo Tian observed the two massive figures before him. They were none other than his previous encounter, Ban Jiang and Ban Hai. Behind them stood several Barbarian warriors, their gazes scanning Luo Tian.

“Oh, although the Ancient Kings have an agreement allowing free entry into each other’s lands, some areas of the Wilder City aren’t accessible to you. Come with me; I’ll take you to meet your Star-Moon Clan representatives. By the way, your Star-Moon Clan’s Fu Xingyue is also here. You can pay your respects!” Ban Jiang smiled, finding nothing unusual about Luo Tian.

“Truly hospitable!” Luo Tian observed Ban Jiang and Ban Hai, inwardly sighing. He maintained a respectful demeanor: “Thank you!”

“Thanks? We’re all allies! Let’s go. I also have business with Fu Xingyue!” Ban Hai waved his hand, leading Luo Tian along the road toward the Sacred God Hall.

Luo Tian thanked again, following Ban Jiang’s group without further conversation. He observed the surroundings with curiosity, feigning the air of a first-time visitor.

“Big brother, what happened to that fat man who broke into the void?” Ban Hai asked, his tone carrying a hint of admiration and causing Luo Tian to subtly tense. He listened attentively.

“Who the hell knows? That bastard was worse than that damned Luo Tian. If I caught him, I’d rip his sinews and flay his skin! The Blood-Devouring Killing Legacy is truly formidable. They killed so many of us, yet he still escaped!” Ban Jiang’s face showed anger as he recalled the blood-soaked massacre in the void.

They had thought entering the void ensured safety. Yet, a blood-cloaked fat man had forced his way in, killing over ten thousand before escaping with severe injuries under Ban Hun’s command.

“Such heavy losses… we can’t underestimate the human race!” Ban Hai mused, recalling Luo Tian’s might and Hu Tianzong and Yang Jinghua.

“Indeed. Who could’ve imagined that the human race lost a Guan Xingjian but gained a Luo Tian? Where did this monster come from?” Ban Jiang replied, his gaze filled with helplessness.

The two marveled at Luo Tian’s rapid growth. When they first met him, he was merely a half-step into the era; now he had leapt to its early stages.

“Shen Gongfei fled?” Luo Tian’s eyes lit up, inwardly thrilled. He hadn’t expected to hear of Shen Gongfei so soon after entering the Wilder City.

“Fled is good!” Luo Tian sighed in relief. If Shen Gongfei had escaped, with his cowardly nature, there would be no problem.

After walking for a while, the group arrived at the Star-Moon Clan’s residence. The Barbarians had allocated a section near the Sacred God Hall for the Star-Moon Clan and other Ancient Kings.

“Fu Xingyue, come out!” Ban Jiang called to the small building, unable to enter but shouting inside.

“What’s wrong?” Fu Xingyue emerged from the grand courtyard, his face pale and a faint gray aura swirling over him.

“Your injury hasn’t healed?” Ban Jiang’s face showed confusion, sensing Fu Xingyue’s lingering wounds.

“A minor issue. Speak up—what is it?” Fu Xingyue cut to the chase.

“Our Sa Man hasn’t agreed to your conditions. I’ve come to inform you: we’ll handle the human race on Qixing Island ourselves. No need for your help!” Ban Jiang conveyed their intent.

“Hah, how arrogant the Barbarians are! The Origin Domain now only has your Barbarian Clan and the human race. You’ve even grown this far. Now we kindly offer to send strong warriors to aid you, yet you refuse!” Fu Xingyue’s face darkened.

“This is Sa Man’s decision. Don’t insult us Barbarians. This is the Wilder City of the Barbarian Clan, not your Star-Moon City!” Ban Jiang detected Fu Xingyue’s disdain and rebuke of Sa Man, his eyes flashing. He scolded.

“This is a Star-Moon Clan member I saw in the Wilder City, mistakenly entering it. Deal with it yourself! I must go to Tu Feiyang; I won’t stay long!” Ban Jiang finished, grabbed Luo Tian with one hand, and tossed him before Fu Xingyue.

Luo Tian listened to their conversation, then feigned helplessness, falling to the ground. He looked up at Fu Xingyue with reverence and slowly rose.

“Don’t send him off!” Fu Xingyue snorted, watching Ban Jiang’s group leave. He gritted his teeth: “Damn barbarians! One day, you’ll suffer like the humans!”

“How did you get here?” Fu Xingyue observed Luo Tian, noting his late-stage Sage appearance. He asked.

“Your Majesty, I don’t know. I was searching for an opportunity in a perilous place when I accidentally stepped into a teleportation array. I was immediately here, entering the Wilder City to use its gateway back to the Star-Moon Clan. Upon arriving, I met them and was brought here!” Luo Tian quickly recited his prepared story.

“Did they capture you?” Fu Xingyue’s expression darkened upon hearing Luo Tian’s account.

“Yes, they did. But they didn’t mistreat me much!” Luo Tian thought quickly, responding. He noticed the Ancient Kings’ internal discord from their conversation.

“Damn it! How dare they capture a Star-Moon Clan member!” Fu Xingyue’s anger intensified upon hearing Luo Tian’s words.

“Hearing that the Star-Moon Clan is proud, I never thought they’d be so arrogant!” Luo Tian inwardly sneered.

“They also said…” Luo Tian decided to add fuel to the fire, feigning hesitation.

“What did they say? Stop hesitating!” Fu Xingyue clearly saw Luo Tian’s hesitation and demanded.

“They also said Fu Xingyue isn’t much better. You were injured by a human who had just ascended to the era, and if he faced Luo Tian, he might’ve been crushed by him!” Luo Tian whispered, gazing at Fu Xingyue.

“Ban Hun? What’s he got to do with it? He even lost to Luo Tian! How dare he mock me!” Fu Xingyue’s chest rose and fell violently.

“They also said your Star-Moon Clan is all looks, no substance…”

“They also said…” Luo Tian seemed to find support, continuously speaking, making Fu Xingyue’s face turn dark. His long fingers clenched into fists, producing a creaking sound.

“Damn barbarians!” Fu Xingyue roared, frustration making him want to vomit. His eyes turned red.

“Your Majesty, calm down. Don’t take it personally. I obtained this elixir from that perilous place. I hope it helps your injury!” Luo Tian quickly spoke, offering a jade vial to Fu Xingyue.

“Elixir?” Fu Xingyue’s eyes showed surprise. He looked at Luo Tian, who clearly was a true Star-Moon Clan member. Though surprised by the elixir’s origin, he still took it.

“You’re good. From now on, follow me!” Fu Xingyue’s eyes showed satisfaction. He opened the vial, checked it, then his brows twitched.

“A late-stage Sage-grade elixir. You’re lucky, kid! Even I would need effort to obtain such an elixir!” Fu Xingyue nodded, satisfied. With this elixir, he saved considerable time in recovery.

“It’s my honor to assist Your Majesty!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully. Internally, he had a plan.

“Come on,” Fu Xingyue led Luo Tian into the Star-Moon Clan’s territory.

Though called a “territory,” the Star-Moon Clan had few people. Besides Fu Xingyue, only a hundred guards lived there.

“Fu Tianong! Arrange a place for him. When I recover, we’ll return to the Star-Moon Continent together!” Fu Xingyue spoke softly to a young man who was equally handsome.

“Yes,” Fu Tianong bowed, leading Luo Tian out of Fu Xingyue’s courtyard.

“What’s your name?” Fu Tianong asked as they walked, his eyes showing disdain. He had clearly seen Luo Tian’s fawning behavior.

“Respectfully, I am Xiao Mengchen!” Luo Tian showed deference, taking out a jade vial containing a late-stage Sage-grade elixir and offering it to Fu Tianong: “This is a gift for the Grand Commander. I hope you won’t find it lacking!”

“Hmph?” Fu Tianong’s face changed, grabbing the vial. His eyes flashed with joy before he nodded.

“Did you find this elixir in that perilous place?” Fu Tianong asked casually, but Luo Tian noticed a fleeting glint of killing intent in his eyes.

“Yes!” Luo Tian’s gaze showed reverence, answering. Internally, he sneered: “Don’t provoke me!”

Chapter 1285: Sneaking into the Sacred God Hall

Night, moonlight glistened over the Star-Moon Clan’s territory. The entire clan was silent. A shadowy figure slipped out of the Star-Moon Clan’s domain, Luo Tian in black attire. His aura was suppressed to its lowest, blending with the night as he appeared on the wide roads of the Barbarian Clan.

As Luo Tian vanished, Fu Tianong sat in his luxurious room, a cold glint on his face: “He still dares to leave. Well, it’s convenient for me to act. The elixir on you is destined to be mine!”

Fu Tianong’s half-epoch cultivation radiated, his body vanishing into the room. Silently following Luo Tian, he wouldn’t be detected by a late-stage Sage.

“Guess I was right. Then it’s your bad luck!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed coldness, his figure darting toward the Sacred God Hall.

“His speed is incredible. No wonder he entered that perilous place and obtained a late-stage Sage-grade elixir!” Fu Tianong’s eyes flashed with surprise, chasing after him.

The Wilder City didn’t sleep at night. Thunderous snoring filled the air. Luo Tian’s speed was astonishing, yet he maintained a distance from Fu Tianong behind him.

“I wonder what scheme you’re up to. If you have ill intentions, I might gain a great achievement by catching you in the act!” Fu Tianong wasn’t hasty, following Luo Tian.

Two figures moved with their own thoughts. After an hour, they finally reached the imposing Sacred God Hall.

Luo Tian paused, gazing at the massive hall. A sense of awe and fear filled him as a mysterious aura from its depths reached his soul, making him wary.

“I’ll just check the perimeter. There shouldn’t be a problem!” Luo Tian’s confidence in the Thousand Mirage Mask allowed him to bypass the Sage-level guards. He slipped into the Sacred God Hall like a black wind.

“Why is he here?” Fu Tianong was puzzled but also suppressed his aura, evading the Sage-level guards’ perception. He followed Luo Tian.

“Huh? I feel something…” As they entered the Sacred God Hall, two massive figures began to speak.

“Not possible. It was just a breeze. No big deal!” Another guard replied.

“Ugh, I don’t know when the guards will come. Who dares to enter our Sacred God Hall!” They chatted loudly.

Luo Tian smiled, appearing at the outermost part of the Sacred God Hall. The central area was where the Barbarian Clan’s supreme leader, Sa Man, resided.

Luo Tian’s spiritual sense spread outward cautiously. He noticed some areas where even his spiritual sense dared not approach.

“Where to?” Luo Tian hid under the night, his eyes glowing as he pondered. This was his first time entering the Sacred God Hall.

Fu Tianong also remained hidden, watching Luo Tian. He waited for Luo Tian’s next move to see what he intended.

“Haha, kid. If you find any treasure, I’ll snatch it and expose you. Then I’ll escape, leaving you to be crushed by the Barbarians!” Fu Tianong thought of how to kill Luo Tian as soon as he entered the Sacred God Hall.

“Huh?” As Luo Tian didn’t know where to go, a massive figure appeared in his line of sight. He hadn’t noticed Luo Tian.

“Ban Long!” Luo Tian’s eyes lit up, spotting the second-ranked prodigy of the Sacred God Hall. He followed Ban Long.

If it were another prodigy, Luo Tian might’ve hesitated. But the Barbarians had weak spiritual senses. His aura was suppressed to its peak, confident he wouldn’t be detected by Ban Long.

Fu Tianong, however, was more troubled. He hadn’t expected to meet Ban Long immediately upon entering. He dared not even breathe, fearing Ban Long would detect him.

“Huh?” Ban Long furrowed his brows. His sharp sense made him feel something was off, but thinking it was the Sacred God Hall, he didn’t dwell on it. He strode forward.

Luo Tian sighed in relief, stealthily following Ban Long without knowing where he was headed.

Throughout the journey, Ban Long said nothing. His steps were large. Soon, they arrived at a stone house.

The stone house was vast, and Ban Long stepped inside. Luo Tian crouched by the window, not daring to follow further but using his spiritual sense to probe inside.

Inside the stone house, Ban Long sat on a massive stone chair. To Luo Tian’s surprise, another person was there—a human.

“What? Ban Long dares to secretly keep a human in the Sacred God Hall! If discovered, it’s a death sentence!” Luo Tian was shocked. He hadn’t expected Ban Long to have ties with the human race.

Upon closer inspection of the human, Luo Tian’s heart shrank.

Spiritual sense revealed an old man with ragged clothes, holding a broken sail. His eyes were white, and he wore a faint smile, gazing toward Luo Tian’s location.

“The blind man!” Luo Tian was stunned. Next moment, without hesitation, he fled toward the Sacred God Hall’s entrance.

At that moment, Luo Tian fully understood. This blind man wasn’t ordinary; being able to walk freely in the Sacred God Hall, he was clearly a great power.

“Damn it! Why did I misjudge him!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly, wishing he had two more legs.

“Good disciple, why are you leaving so soon!” A voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind. It startled him.

“Who’s your disciple!” Luo Tian roared inwardly, ignoring the old man’s voice. He dashed toward the entrance.

“Someone…!” As Luo Tian moved, Ban Long’s roar echoed through the silent Sacred God Hall.

His loud voice sounded like a thunderclap in the quiet night, instantly stirring the entire Sacred God Hall.

“Buzz…” A series of powerful figures rose abruptly, causing Luo Tian’s face to sweat coldly.

“Boom…” A series of deep roars echoed. A massive figure appeared behind Luo Tian—Ban Hun, the first-ranked prodigy of the Barbarian Clan.

“Who dares to cause trouble in our Sacred God Hall!” Ban Hun roared, as if imbued with invisible power. His speed surged, instantly blocking the Sacred God Hall’s entrance.

“Want to catch me? You’re dreaming!” Ban Hun’s speed was fast, but Luo Tian’s was faster. They nearly exited together. Before Ban Hun’s foot landed, Luo Tian had already escaped the Sacred God Hall.

“Fu Tianong wanted to ambush me. I’ll see who’s the one being ambushed!” As Luo Tian passed Fu Tianong, he pointed his finger. A surge of Dao power erupted, instantly entangling Fu Tianong hiding in a corner.

“This…!” Fu Tianong was stunned. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to detect him. By the time he reacted, Fu Tianong’s figure was already in Ban Hun’s view.

Everything happened in an instant. Luo Tian didn’t stop. Though he hadn’t gathered any information, his other goal was achieved: to kill Fu Tianong.

“Fu Tianong!” Ban Hun’s face changed instantly upon seeing Fu Tianong. He naturally recognized him. In the Wilder City, anyone from other Ancient Kings was known to Ban Hun.

“Everyone, listen to me. I came with a Star-Moon Clan member. He wanted to harm you!” Fu Tianong, seeing Ban Hun’s dark face, nearly wet his pants.

“Rubbish! I just visited your place yesterday. It must be Fu Xingyue’s bastard who sent you! Speak up, does your Star-Moon Clan plan to harm us!” Ban Jiang and Ban Hai’s faces showed anger as they addressed Fu Tianong.

“Enough. Bring him to me!” As a group of Barbarian warriors prepared to tear Fu Tianong apart, a deep voice echoed in their ears. Ban Hun and others immediately showed respect.

Ban Long stepped out of the crowd, grabbed Fu Tianong who had been subdued by Ban Hun, and held him like a chicken. He led Fu Tianong into the stone house where Luo Tian had been discovered.

Luo Tian didn’t know what Fu Tianong faced, but his heart trembled. He was awestruck by the blind old man’s ability to move unnoticed, his power reaching everywhere. He had not only entered Qixing Island but also the Barbarian Clan.

“Who is he?” Luo Tian pondered endlessly, even considering returning to the Star-Moon Clan’s territory. After all, the blind old man must’ve recognized him; otherwise, he wouldn’t have said that.

“Calling me his disciple. Great powers’ minds are impossible to guess! What’s Ban Long’s relationship with the blind old man!” Luo Tian thought endlessly but decided to gamble. He bet the blind old man wouldn’t expose his identity, as he was also a human.

Luo Tian returned to his residence, waiting for dawn. He meditated with inner turmoil.

Chapter 1286: Conflict Between Clans

Time passed swiftly. Under Luo Tian’s anxious cultivation, the next day finally arrived. As the sun rose, a furious roar shattered Luo Tian’s meditation.

“Fu Xingyue! Come out!” The Barbarian clan’s unique loud voice echoed through the Star-Moon Clan’s territory, making Luo Tian tense and step out of his room.

“Boom…” Several massive figures descended from the sky. Though flight was forbidden in the Wilder City, Ban Hun, as the first-ranked prodigy of the Sacred God Hall, was exempt.

“What’s happening!” The entire Wilder City trembled. The Barbarian giants looked at the Star-Moon Clan’s direction with confusion.

“You haven’t heard? Last night, the Star-Moon Clan’s Grand Commander sneaked into the Sacred God Hall and was caught by us!”

“Truly deserved! Daring to target the Sacred God Hall, they’re just begging for death!” The families living in the Wilder City showed coldness. They spontaneously surrounded the Star-Moon Clan’s territory, preventing even a fly from escaping.

“Ban Hun, why are you so early in the morning? What’s wrong with you?” Fu Xingyue, still pale-faced and handsome, stepped out of his courtyard. His eyes glared at the气势汹涌 (overwhelming) Ban Hun and other prodigies.

Because of Luo Tian’s provocation, Fu Xingyue had already been angry at the Barbarians.

“Haha! You are who? The Star-Moon Clan’s prince. Looking down on us Barbarians, always acting high and mighty. I never thought you’d be a thief!” Ban Hun stared at Fu Xingyue, his eyes deep with anger.

“Star-Moon Guard!” Fu Xingyue turned and called to the hundred men behind him. Though pale, his face was still fierce.

“Fu Tianong!” Fu Xingyue instinctively called out the Grand Commander’s name, scanning over his guards.

But immediately after, there was no response. He turned and scanned the crowd: “Where is Fu Tianong!”

“This, the Grand Commander isn’t in the territory!” Luo Tian quickly spoke, gazing at Fu Xingyue.

“What? That bastard! When he returns, I’ll flay his skin!” Fu Xingyue gritted his teeth. He pointed at Luo Tian.

“You! Take charge of these hundred men!” Fu Xingyue spoke to Luo Tian, his tone casual.

Seeing Fu Xingyue so quickly appointing Luo Tian to command them, the hundred guards showed envy. Yet no one dared question.

“Fu Xingyue, are you looking for your Grand Commander Fu Tianong? Want to flay his skin and rip out his sinews? I have a dead man here, but no flaying or sinew removal. Look, do you recognize him!” Ban Hun sneered at Fu Xingyue, thinking Fu Xingyue was acting.

“Ban Hun, don’t play with words. Why do you call me a thief? Produce evidence! If you can’t, don’t blame me for being unkind. Though this is in the Wilder City, I Fu Xingyue am not someone to be trifled with!” Fu Xingyue’s eyes flashed coldly, his voice sharp.

“Haha! Evidence? Then look who this is!” Ban Hun didn’t want to argue further. He waved his hand, and a figure was thrown onto the ground.

“A corpse!” Fu Xingyue’s face showed confusion, gazing at the body. His eyes were soon replaced by anger.

“Grand Commander!” Luo Tian shouted, his expression shocked.

A murmur spread. The Star-Moon Guards’ faces changed, their eyes filled with killing intent toward the Barbarians.

“Ban Hun, what do you mean? Why did you kill my Star-Moon Clan Grand Commander without reason! If you don’t give me an explanation, it’s not over!” Fu Xingyue glared at Ban Hun.

“Haha! You want an explanation? Fu Xingyue, your Grand Commander sneaked into my Sacred God Hall at night. You want me to give you an explanation? I’d like to ask for one too! Killing without reason in the Sacred God Hall, do you want to provoke a war between our clans!” Ban Hun’s face darkened. His voice thundered, outmatching Fu Xingyue by ten times.

“Hiss…” Luo Tian stood behind Fu Xingyue, his head ringing from Ban Hun’s loud voice. Seeing no one targeted him, he gradually relaxed, thinking about how to further ignite the conflict.

“Ban Hun, don’t push too hard!” Fu Xingyue panted. Though furious, he remained rational, knowing he was in the Barbarian Clan’s territory.

“Your Majesty, calm down. We’re currently weak. You have an injury; it’s not wise to fight. Since the Barbarians are bullying us, let’s temporarily endure and pacify them!” Luo Tian spoke to Fu Xingyue, his tone showing patience.

“Why? We’ve lost a man. They came to our doorstep and demanded an explanation. Why should I endure!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Fu Xingyue didn’t calm down but felt more insulted.

“When have I ever endured such humiliation!” Fu Xingyue’s chest rose and fell violently. His eyes stared fiercely at Ban Hun.

“Staring at what?” Ban Hun saw Fu Xingyue’s gaze and felt anger. It was the other side that was wrong, yet they acted as if insulted.

“Staring at you! What can you do about it!” Fu Xingyue shouted, summoning his Star-Moon spear. His eyes showed madness.

“Damn it! You really think you’re something! Looks good but no substance!” Ban Hun saw Fu Xingyue draw a weapon. His anger flared, and the impulsive Ban Hun immediately extended his foot toward Fu Xingyue.

“Damn it! The Barbarians are too bullying!” Luo Tian hid among the crowd, changing his voice. His voice echoed in the Star-Moon Guards’ ears.

“Hey! You guys really want to turn over!” Ban Jiang and Ban Hai’s faces showed displeasure. Their massive bodies rushed toward the Star-Moon Guards.

“Crack…” At the same time, Ban Hun’s foot crashed onto Fu Xingyue’s spear.

With their clash, the Star-Moon Clan’s territory turned into a battlefield. Both sides clashed immediately.

The sound of explosions echoed constantly. Though the Star-Moon Guards were strong, all at Sage level, they couldn’t withstand the Barbarian giants. After all, this was the Wilder City. Who lived here wasn’t someone without strength. Plus, Ban Jiang and Ban Hai, the top prodigies of the Sacred God Hall.

Luo Tian dodged left and right, avoiding massive fists. His spiritual sense observed the battlefield.

“Pure domination!” Luo Tian inwardly sighed. These hundred Star-Moon Guards were like children fighting adults.

On the other side, Fu Xingyue and Ban Hun’s battle was also dire. Fu Xingyue had an injury, but he had taken Luo Tian’s elixir and recovered somewhat. Still, the injury remained.

Ban Hun, however, was different. He had fought Yang Jinghua in the Sea’s Edge battlefield and subdued him without a scratch. Returning to the Barbarian Clan, he had rested briefly and fully recovered his peak strength.
