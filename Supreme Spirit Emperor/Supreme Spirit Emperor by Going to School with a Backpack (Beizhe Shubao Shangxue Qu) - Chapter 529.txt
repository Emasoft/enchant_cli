“Not done yet! What's a prodigy? I'll suppress you all!” Ye Liangchen hurled talismans while shouting. “Who dares use martial arts within the military camp? Don’t you know the regulations?” As talismans and martial techniques exploded, deafening thunderous sounds echoed across Bountiful Heaven City. “It’s from the Eighth Army!” People quickly identified the source of the tremors and rushed toward the Eighth Army. “Ye Liangchen, you’ve gone too far! If I don’t make you unrecognizable as your father, I’ll never forgive myself!” Zhou Cang, battered and desperate, finally retaliated with martial arts. “Buzz…” A golden fist descended from the sky, colliding with a star and detonating with earth-shaking force. Seeing Zhou Cang fight back, others joined the fray, unleashing powerful martial arts. “You dare resist?!” Ye Liangchen roared, startled but his eyes gleamed fiercer. If they hadn’t resisted, he’d have trouble explaining to superiors. But now their defiance made it impossible to clarify. “Hah! What use is resistance? I’ve a mountain of talismans—your trash will be crushed by me! I am the Heavenly Prodigy, and defeating you is but a flick of my fingers!” Ye Liangchen boasted, yet hurled talismans more vigorously. “Ye Liangchen, I don’t believe your talismans never end! When they run out, I’ll finish you—no one can save you!” They howled in frustration. Having arrived earlier, they hesitated to use their talismans, fearing they might save their lives. To them, Ye Liangchen was a fool; wasting talismans seemed absurd. “Hah! When I run out, these talismans will be used as toilet paper—how could they ever end!” Ye Liangchen retorted, secretly anxious. He cursed Luo Tian for not emerging from cultivation and Ke Duanshan for hearing the commotion. Time passed slowly; though the courtyard had a barrier, it lay in ruins with smoke rising everywhere. People arrived, surprised by Zhou Cang’s battle. “Hmph, no one will intervene?” They murmured, watching the spectacle without stopping it. Normally, they fought only to slay ghosts, rarely using martial arts openly. This blatant violation of military rules was unprecedented; the rarity made them reluctant to interfere. “Damn… out!” Ye Liangchen instinctively checked his storage ring, but his face turned embarrassed. He’d used many talismans against ghosts and more now, leaving him empty-handed. “Ye Liangchen, come here!” Smoke cleared, revealing Zhou Cang’s battered form, eyes burning with hatred as he lunged. Chapter 2027: Arms Too Long “Ye Liangchen, you’re done! No talismans left—I’ll imprison you in the latrine for a thousand years!” Zhou Cang bellowed, charging with hatred. “Ye Liangchen, you’ve reached your end!” Jiang Xuan and others shouted, scheming how to torment Ye Liangchen. “Buzz…” As they moved, radiant light shot from Ye Liangchen’s hands toward Zhou Cang. “Flying swords!” Zhou Cang halted, snatching the blades. “With just a few lower-grade immortal weapons, do you think you can stop us?” Jiang Xuan sneered, fiddling with the sword. “Of course not!” Ye Liangchen laughed, poking his finger—mid-grade weapons trembled violently. “Explode!” Ye Liangchen roared, and thunderous detonations echoed again. They clutched the weapons, intending to mock Ye Liangchen, but his explosion shattered their confidence. “No talismans? I’ve immortal weapons to blow up! Let’s see how many rounds you can endure!” Ye Liangchen laughed, watching them blackened and scorched. Had they reacted slower, they’d have been severely wounded. “Buzz…” Ye Liangchen waved again, mid-grade weapons flying toward Zhou Cang. New explosions erupted. “Damn it! So many self-destructing immortal weapons—don’t you care?” Zhou Cang howled, finally submitting. “Truly a prodigy of Star River Mansion! How wealthy he is—these must be from his mansion. Those talismans were costly, and now mid-grade weapons!” People murmured, gazing at Ye Liangchen’s relentless throws. “Truly exhilarating! Fought six prodigies alone—I’m invincible!” Ye Liangchen cackled, his voice霸道. Time passed; people watched him unrelentingly, their mouths twitching as he continuously detonated mid-grade weapons. “Three hundred and more! How many mid-grade weapons does he have? My god!” They were stunned by his wealth. “Puke…” Zhou Cang’s group was dazed, spitting blood; even with defenses, they were wounded. “Mid-grade immortal weapons!” But soon, Ye Liangchen’s next throw left them gasping—six objects hurtled toward them. Mid-grade weapons’ self-destruction rivaled early-stage True Immortals, surpassing it. They’d already been injured; another hit would cost them their lives. “Mid-grade weapons! Fifty thousand battle merits each—unattainable! This Ye Liangchen is truly reckless, tossing six at once—he’s a true wastrel!” People were speechless, elevating his reputation. “Ye Liangchen, stop! We yield!” They shouted desperately. “Too late!” Ye Liangchen’s eyes gleamed coldly; their arrival to find Luo Tian was no good. Worse, they’d dared utter Ye Wudao’s name disrespectfully—unforgivable in his eyes. He was certain even if it spread, their faction wouldn’t dare offend Star River Mansion. Killing intent brewed when Zhou Cang’s group insulted Ye Wudao, dismissing him. Their defeat and threats had hardened Ye Liangchen’s resolve; years of feigning a wastrel had bred his vengeful nature. “Destruction Spear!” “Five Emperor Palms!” Zhou Cang and Jiang Xuan’s faces twisted madly, seeing Ye Liangchen not retrieve the mid-grade weapons. Six thunderous explosions shattered the sky, annihilating everything, forcing onlookers back. “Not dead?” Ye Liangchen’s eyes flickered; he hadn’t expected them to survive. “Time to reveal some secrets!” Ye Liangchen clenched his fists, gazing at Zhou Cang’s group emerging from smoke—rags, bloodstained, their power diminished. “Ye Liangchen, I’ll kill you! Do you still have mid-grade weapons?” Zhou Cang roared, brandishing a golden spear. Their battle cries echoed; Ye Liangchen had ignited their killing intent. Originally, they’d meant to teach him a lesson, but now bloodthirsty, they cared not for Star River Mansion. “Buzz…” As they prepared to strike, the camp’s spiritual energy vanished abruptly. Once spiritual and ghostly energies clashed, this void left ghosts dominant, surging as black entities from the sky. “What’s happening? Spiritual energy vanished so much—did someone ascend to True Immortal?” People gasped, such a drain only occurred at ascension. “Go back!” A cold voice echoed; the descending ghosts halted, vanishing into black mist under stunned gazes. “Crack… crack…” Two sharp cracks echoed, like thunderclaps. “Boom!” A wave surged as a youth strode from the courtyard, eyes icy toward Zhou Cang’s group. “What do you want?” Luo Tian’s cold gaze made people shiver. “N-nothing…” Zhou Cang stammered, overwhelmed by Luo Tian’s aura. “Then you’re here to cause trouble?” Luo Tian’s face darkened. “Ah…” “No, Luo Tian! Hand over the Ghost Valley Mandate or else… else…” A youth shouted but faltered under Luo Tian’s gaze. “Ghost Valley Mandate!” People understood immediately. Though Zhou Cang’s faction had no mandate, they could gift it to others—like Nie Yuntian. “Ah! So that’s the plan!” People nodded, eyes gleaming at Luo Tian. They could also demand the mandate, exchanging favors. “Boom!” A thunderous collision echoed; a scene unfolded—Luo Tian’s foot crushed Zhou Cang, his gaze sweeping the others. “What do you want?” Luo Tian turned to Jiang Xuan’s group. “Who dares use martial arts in the camp?” As Luo Tian prepared to punish Jiang Xuan, a stern voice echoed. The sky trembled; a blue figure materialized above, cold eyes scanning Luo Tian’s group. “Respect the Sixth Army Commander!” People bowed respectfully. “Sixth Army, Blue Sky Military Commander Wang Changqing!” Luo Tian was startled, sensing a plot. “This time should be when ghosts attack,” he mused, eyes darkening. “Dare use martial arts in the camp! Though I’m Sixth Army Commander, I am a Bountiful Heaven City general. Seize these boys!” Wang Changqing coldly ordered, eyes on Luo Tian. “Wang Changqing, your reach is too long!” As Wang’s words ended, Ke Duanshan returned from the battlefield, his eyes flashing. Chapter 2028: Purpose “Ke Duanshan!” Wang Changqing was stunned; Ke had returned during the ghost attack. “What’s happening?” Ke scrutinized Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen, having heard the commotion. Though he wanted to return, leaving the battlefield was a grave mistake. Yet, eighth army spiritual energy hinted at another commander’s plot—only Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen were there. If others targeted Luo Tian, Ke would struggle to retrieve him. But if a commander took Luo Tian, it’d be complicated. Thus, Ke returned. “Ke Duanshan, this man used martial arts in the camp—serious offense!” Wang ordered, eyes on Ke. “I’ll handle it.” Ke coldly glanced at Wang. “Fine, if you take charge, I won’t interfere.” Wang grabbed the terrified men, anger in his eyes. “Commander, this can’t be overlooked! They trashed our eighth army, attacked me, and used martial arts—vile villains!” “We didn’t use martial arts!” Ye Liangchen protested, having lost many talismans and weapons. “Buzz…” Sword energy cut the men mid-air, sending them crashing. “Ye Liangchen, don’t lie! You used talismans first—we fought back!” Zhou Cang spat blood but retorted. “Nonsense! If I weren’t so strong, you’d have killed me! Are talismans martial arts?” Ye Liangchen roared. “Spit!” Jiang Xuan’s group coughed blood; they’d been dominated. “Commander, I was in cultivation when these men stormed the camp. If not for Ye Liangchen’s sacrifice, I’d be dead from qi backlash!” “Commander, we’re your soldiers. If these men aren’t punished, it’ll undermine our eighth army’s morale!” “They came to insult us!” Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen chanted, appearing as heroes. Onlookers twitched, almost swayed by their lies. Ke’s veins throbbed; Wang’s face was pale. “You two could act more convincingly! Who’s seen such orderly battles?” “Commander, he lies!” Zhou Cang, battered, could only spit blood. Jiang Xuan’s group cursed. “Then why did you come? Did you stroll here? Why attack me?” Ye Liangchen deflected. “We came to find Luo Tian about something!” Jiang Xuan shouted but faltered under Ke’s gaze. “Enough! Be quiet!” Ke and Wang barked, silencing Ye Liangchen’s chatter. “This acting is unmatched! Why are there such actors around me?” Luo Tian sighed, mirroring Ye Liangchen’s pitiful gaze. “You’re at fault first; you’re wounded. This ends here, but compensate for the camp’s damage and receive thirty lashes at the military office.” Ke ordered. “We…” Their faces turned crimson; they’d done nothing but be beaten, yet faced punishment. Yet Ke’s orders were military law—only Bountiful Heaven City’s commander could override it. “Ke Duanshan, how about these two?” Wang glared, his plan to lure Luo Tian into giving the Ghost Valley Mandate. If he refused, Wang would seize him under military rules. But Ke’s return surprised him. “Punish them! Three months’ confinement, no leaving; copy military rules three thousand times.” Ke smiled, pleased with Luo Tian’s half-True Immortal progress. “Is this punishment?” People murmured, understanding it was their fault. The eight armies belonged to Bountiful Heaven City but competed; this rivalry benefited the city. “Commander, I’m a hero! I protected our eighth army! I lost much—talismans and weapons!” Ye Liangchen cried. “Yes, a hero. Award one million battle merits! Also, let them compensate together.” Ke nodded, indifferent. “What!” People gasped; even Jiang Xuan’s group turned pale. “Thank you, Commander!” Ye Liangchen laughed, approaching Zhou Cang’s group. “Hand over! I used fifteen thousand talismans—twelve thousand mid-grade, three thousand high-grade; three hundred fifty lower-grade weapons, six mid-grade!” Ye Liangchen shrugged. Ke and Wang were stunned. “Did this kid bring Star River Mansion’s treasury?” Wang thought, as did Ke. “Everyone saw it—no lies!” Ye Liangchen insisted. “Fine.” Ke waved, agreeing. Though he’d regret it, Zhou Cang’s group had no choice. The incident ended; Ye Liangchen collected their storage rings, returning to Luo Tian. Wang begrudged but couldn’t stop it, snorting and leaving. “Disperse!” Ke ordered, returning to the battlefield. Though resolved, Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen’s names burned in Bountiful Heaven City. No one dared challenge Luo Tian after Zhou Cang’s defeat—both wounded and bankrupt. Though confined three months, Luo Tian had no plans to leave; he aimed to refine Ghost-Repelling Pills for battle merits. “Unsure if feasible.” Luo Tian stood, focused on the Heji Flame Cauldron. Previously, he could refine three pills by draining spiritual energy, but three were insufficient. He aimed to target the Treasure Refining Hall’s items—seen many treasures, even upper-grade immortal weapons. He planned to exchange them for himself, Ye Liangchen, and Huo Zhen. Luo Tian chose not to hunt ghosts outside Bountiful Heaven City, despite the Ghost-Tracking Seal. It was too dangerous; even Hell’s forces watched him. He couldn’t risk it. Ghost-Repelling Pills were his best bet, hence his focus. “Buzz…” Luo Tian pointed, the Ghost-Tracking Seal flew into the Heji Flame Cauldron. “Huff…” As he activated it, the seal’s suction drew massive ghost energy. Chapter 2029: Vast Quantity of Ghost-Repelling Pills The colossal ghost energy surged into the cauldron, thundering louder than before—hundredfold more than his previous draws. The cauldron’s ghost energy reached terrifying levels, almost凝聚成鬼物. “Refine…” Luo Tian chanted, flames engulfing the cauldron. Thunderous collisions echoed within. “Boom… boom…” The explosions shook the courtyard, echoing across the camp. Anyone familiar would be shocked; Luo Tian’s method was unprecedented. Time passed slowly; even as a half-True Immortal, Luo Tian’s face paled—this refinement was too much. He didn’t know his limits, so he tested incrementally, reducing ghost energy to gauge. Three hours later, Luo Tian’s face was pale as paper; the cauldron trembled violently. “Big Brother… what are you doing?” Ye Liangchen stammered, watching the cauldron’s chaos. “Run!” Luo Tian calmly ordered, flying off with Ye Liangchen as a streak of light. They didn’t flee to open ground but directly to the battlefield, panting. “Huh? Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen were confined—how are they here?” People wondered, during the ceasefire. “Commander, return to the camp—its going to explode!” Luo Tian shouted, gazing at Ke Duanshan on the wall. “Hmph?” Ke frowned but saw the camp’s chaos, then flew up. As he arrived, a deafening sound echoed—sky trembled, Bountiful Heaven City shook like an earthquake. “Buzz…” A black pillar shot skyward, radiating immense power. “Damn it! What did you do, Luo Tian?” Ke roared, casting six印记 to stabilize the chaos. The cauldron’s tremors eased. “Buzz…” Ke channeled black True Immortal energy, forming a head to swallow the pillar. “Huff…” Ke exhaled, wiping sweat, gazing at Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen. “Want to die?” Ke returned to the battlefield, glaring at Luo Tian. Ye Liangchen was a nuisance; Luo Tian wasn’t kind. They caused trouble despite no provocation—exasperating. The explosion could’ve destroyed the eighth army’s camp, capable of killing a late-stage True Immortal. Even with barriers, it wouldn’t hold unless Bountiful Heaven’s barriers were used. “Commander, mistake! All mistakes!” Luo Tian awkwardly smiled, surprised by the explosion. He aimed to refine five hundred pills but miscalculated—ghost energy was enough, yet he couldn’t control it. “If there’s another time, I’ll expel you two from Bountiful Heaven City to feed ghosts!” Ke snarled, shaking his head. “Commander, you’re too kind to Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen!” People marveled they weren’t punished, though some envied. “Commander, these two cause trouble for our eighth army—deeming them dead would uphold military discipline. Otherwise, frontline soldiers won’t accept!” A soldier, Ye Fu, spoke angrily. His words sparked others’ discontent. “Why are they unpunished while we are? Sometimes executed!” People argued, mostly fellow prodigies. Veterans stayed silent. “Who questions my decision?” Ke smiled, scanning the murmurers. Their gazes froze them into silence. “Remember what I told you on your first day here?” “Seems you’ve wasted months! Perhaps I was too kind.” Ke sighed, pointing. “Him, expelled from Bountiful Heaven City!” He ordered; two thousand-commanders grabbed Ye Fu, throwing him over the wall. “Him, and him…” Ke continued, dragging others out. “Commander, I’m a Star River Mansion disciple!” Ye Fu pleaded. Others also begged, shocked by Ke’s cruelty. Exile meant death in Bountiful Heaven’s ghost-infested outskirts. “You’ll stay fifteen days outside; if you return, I won’t kill you.” Ke ordered. “Commander…” Ye Fu’s cries echoed as they were thrown out, barriers sealing them. They begged but Ke ignored. Finally, Ye Fu’s group glared at Ke and Luo Tian before rushing into the black mist. “All done? No objections?” Ke ordered, watching trembling prodigies. “Yes!” The eighth army roared, each returning to their tasks, despair in their eyes as Ye Fu’s group vanished. “Cold-blooded!” Ye Liangchen and Luo Tian returned, sighing. “Disobeying command is a grave mistake. If Ye Fu’s group defied the commander during war, consequences would be dire. Hence, he punished them but not us—because their presence undermines morale.” Luo Tian explained, understanding the reason. Ye Fu’s group hadn’t adapted to their roles; even Ye Wudao would’ve been killed. “I see.” Ye Liangchen shivered, recalling his past recklessness. “You’re safe because you’re a scoundrel—everyone knows.” Luo Tian smiled but didn’t say more. “Big Brother, what next?” Ye Liangchen asked, ignoring Luo Tian’s odd gaze. “Refining pills, of course!” Luo Tian gleamed, but shook his head at the previous explosion. Ke had warned against another blast. “Relax, I’ve experience now!” Luo Tian smiled, sighing. He’d start small—ten pills first, then twenty, gradually finding his limit. “Okay.” Ye Liangchen hesitated but nodded. “Start with ten!” Luo Tian smiled, recovering. Three hours later, the Heji Flame Cauldron buzzed again. Refining ten was smoother; an hour later, ten Ghost-Repelling Pills appeared. Ye Liangchen beamed. “My god! Ten pills—Big Brother, we’re rich!” “Next, fifteen!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered; his plan worked. “Ten… fifteen…” He added five each time, cautious not to overdo it. Chapter 2030: Blast the Furnace for Fun Time passed; the month-long rotation ended, and eighth army soldiers returned battered.
