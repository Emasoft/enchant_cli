These individuals held immense influence throughout the Lower Three Heavens, standing at the pinnacle of its hierarchy. Even within the Middle Three Heavens, they remained formidable forces.

"Some people simply have reservations about the past decision!" an elder spoke, his gaze lingering on Zuo Qiuming.

"Indeed, they had doubts. Zuo Qiuming was originally a disciple of the Dragon Path. Even after being stationed in Tianlong City, his cultivation had not declined; he had ascended to the late-stage Celestial Immortal realm. I believe his direct disciple status should be restored, granting him the right to vie for the sect leader position!" another elder declared.

"Ridiculous! How did you act back then? Now that your disciple isn't up to the task, you're selling out to Master Xue's favor? There's no such luck!" As the elder's words faded, another elder immediately protested.

"Ah, so Tianlong City Lord truly has such a powerful background! No wonder he disregards everyone's face!" As the crowd listened to these Lower Three Heavens' top-tier experts arguing, they finally understood.

"Enough! Stop bickering!" Li Changfeng felt his head throb. These people had failed to challenge him before, and now their disciples were vying for the position.

"Let's stick to tradition—vote!" Li Changfeng spoke softly, his gaze sweeping over the assembly before resorting to their usual method of resolving disputes.

Everyone was stunned, including Luo Tian. What day was this? Not the disciple recruitment day—why had it suddenly turned into a leadership contest?

"Truly..." Luo Tian shook his head in disbelief. Seven True Immortals now casting votes like commoners.

"Three to three!" As people marveled, the old men concluded their vote. The result left Li Changfeng neutral—half supported Zuo Qiuming's right to vie for leadership, the other half opposed.

"You!" Zhang Jinghuan glared at the two elders beside Master Xue, who had once stood alongside them. Now they'd abruptly reneged.

"Years of service, Master Xue," Li Changfeng's brow furrowed slightly as he glanced at Xue Changshan with calculated intent.

"That's my son-in-law!" Master Xue snorted, though his eyes carried a bitter edge. After all, two stood on their side now—but Li Changfeng still held one vote.

"Li Changfeng, make your choice already! This is tedious!" Zhang Jinghuan's gaze held amusement. To him, Ke Zhenghao was the most likely successor. Li Changfeng wouldn't allow Zuo Qiuming to interfere again, especially since Zuo had once overshadowed Ke.

"Master Li, if you refuse, I'll have to choose another sect!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze on Li Changfeng.

"Ha! Master Li, hurry up—we've waited long enough!" Zhao Tiancheng and Song Lao exchanged glances upon hearing Luo Tian's words, their eyes gleaming. Their opportunity had returned.

"Child, where do you get the right to speak?" Zhang Jinghuan's gaze turned cold as he extended his hand, slamming it toward Luo Tian.

"Stop!" Zuo Qiuming's expression shifted instantly upon sensing Zhang Jinghuan's aura. He could feel Zhang's strike would crush Luo Tian without a chance. A late-stage Celestial Immortal would be obliterated, even if Luo Tian's body was extraordinary.

"Damn!" Luo Tian's eyes darkened. He hadn't expected Zhang Jinghuan to be so capricious, striking him outright.

Chapter 1809: Xuandan's Elixir

Overwhelming pressure caused Luo Tian to tremble violently, his eyes filled with resentment as he stared at the massive hand descending upon him.

Too fast. No one expected Tianlong Sect's Grand Elder to suddenly attack this candidate for admission.

"Damn!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly, regretting exposing Zuo Qiuming's matter too soon—now he faced this fate.

"Old fool!" Luo Tian seethed, his blood seemingly freezing under the pressure.

Yet Luo Tian wasn't passive. As he recovered slightly, golden light erupted from his body.

In an instant, when people assumed Luo Tian was doomed, a streak of light flashed. Zuo Qiuming, nearest to Luo Tian, appeared before him, his shoulder struck by a golden palm.

"Spit...!" Zuo Qiuming's mouth erupted with blood, his body colliding with Luo Tian as he was hurled backward.

"Qiuming!" Xue Changshan roared, his eyes blazing with fury as he rushed forward to catch Luo Tian and Zuo Qiuming.

"A True Immortal, one strike reduced the City Lord to this!" The crowd shuddered involuntarily, imagining their own fates should they be struck.

"Zhang Jinghuan, you seek death!" Xue Changshan's eyes flashed cold as he glared at Zhang Jinghuan, who stood bewildered. He hadn't expected Zuo Qiuming to suddenly block for the boy.

"Glug...glug..." Blood gushed from Zuo Qiuming's mouth, instantly staining his chest.

"Ah...ah..." Luo Tian coughed violently, feeling as if struck by a mountain. His bones had surely fractured.

"Truly strong..." Luo Tian's eyes held a bitter smile. If Zuo Qiuming hadn't blocked, he'd likely be a pile of flesh.

"Big brother!" Immediately after, Luo Tian sensed Zuo Qiuming's injuries were worse than his own. His eyes shifted.

Though Luo Tian had always appeared affectionate toward Zuo Qiuming, he'd maintained some vigilance. He knew Zuo's help had its own purpose. Yet now, seeing Zuo near death, Luo Tian's barriers crumbled.

"Qiuming... hold on!" Xue Changshan furrowed his brow, pressing his palm against Zuo Qiuming's body. Radiant light emanated from Xue's hands, gradually mending Zuo Qiuming's wounds. Yet Xue's expression darkened increasingly.

After Zuo Qiuming's injuries healed, Xue Changshan retrieved a pill, placing it in his mouth.

"How is he?" Xue Yushan asked, gazing at the unconscious Zuo Qiuming.

"Unknown. His injuries are severe—his internal organs nearly shattered!" Xue Changshan slowly lifted his head, gazing at Zhang Jinghuan.

"Zhang Jinghuan, for a junior, you struck so harshly?" Xue Changshan spoke coldly, his aura surging.

"I didn't mean to. You saw it yourself—your son-in-law deliberately charged into my attack!" Zhang Jinghuan, seeing Xue's murderous gaze, quickly explained. He didn't want to clash with this monster.

"Regardless, the result is clear. You injured my junior— I'll destroy your family!" Xue Changshan's face bore coldness. He soared into the air, rushing toward Zhang Jinghuan with a golden fist like an ascending sun.

"Fool!" Zhang Jinghuan's face shifted as he saw Xue charging. In Tianlong Sect, the two people not to offend were not the sect leader Li Changfeng but Xue Changshan and Xuandan. Xue was known as a monster—his strength was unparalleled, and his actions reckless. Xuandan was revered as a deity among healers, holding immense prestige.

"Boom..." The next moment, Xue's furious strike descended. Zhang Jinghuan could only grit his teeth and counter with a palm.

"Crack..." Like thunder in clear skies, the sound made everyone's faces pale.

Above, Zhang Jinghuan was repelled violently while Xue relentlessly pressed forward. Li Changfeng and the others could only watch helplessly—no one dared intervene, knowing Xue was unstoppable.

"Xue Changshan, you fool! Your son-in-law isn't dead yet—why are you fighting like this?" Zhang Jinghuan cursed repeatedly, barely catching his breath against Xue's madness. Yet he knew this Xue wasn't the most terrifying.

"Master Xue, we must save your son-in-law. It's better than you fighting like this! These years, why have you grown more reckless?" Li Changfeng shouted at Xue, glancing at the flushed Zuo Qiuming.

"Dad, come down. Qiuming is barely alive!" Xue Yushan's face showed anxiety as she sensed Zuo Qiuming's worsening state, shouting at Xue.

"If my son-in-law suffers any harm, and my daughter becomes a widow, this isn't over. I'll make you wish for death!" Xue Changshan heard Xue Yushan's plea, his eyes regaining clarity. He coldly snorted and halted, flying to Zuo Qiuming's side.

Luo Tian, pale-faced, watched Zuo Qiuming. Though wounded, he felt Zuo's condition was far worse—internal organs shattered, his life force fading.

"Get out of the way!" Xue Changshan found Luo Tian annoying. If not for blocking that killing strike, Zuo wouldn't be in this state.

"Respectful elder, don't move! If you do, it'll be too late!" Luo Tian, despite being scolded, spoke loudly.

"Out! My son-in-law isn't your concern!" Xue Changshan's face darkened at Luo Tian's obstruction.

"Elder, I know some healing arts. Let me examine him!" Luo Tian firmly gazed at Xue Changshan, his aura radiating. He stepped forward, blocking Xue's path with a pale face.

"Hmm?" After three breaths, Xue Changshan felt Luo Tian's resolve. Xue Yushan also softly explained to Xue Changshan how Luo Tian had treated Zuo Qiuming's poison, prompting Xue to nod slightly: "Go!"

Xue Changshan sighed deeply before suddenly shouting toward Tianlong Mountain: "Xuandan, you old bastard—come out! I owe you a favor!"

Hearing Xue's words, everyone's mouths twitched. Only Xue dared call Xuandan "old bastard" in the entire Tianlong Mountain.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian's eyes were grave as he retrieved silver needles, staring intently at Zuo Qiuming lying there.

"No mistakes!" Luo Tian muttered internally. His confidence in his acupuncture wasn't absolute, but Zuo Qiuming couldn't afford any mishaps. Luo Tian had no choice but to first stabilize his life force with healing arts, then find a way to concoct pills for Zuo Qiuming's recovery.

"Must succeed!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with violet light, forgetting his surroundings. He adjusted his state, recalling every time he'd performed acupuncture on others.

"Buzz..." As Xue Changshan grew impatient, Luo Tian moved. His silver needles flashed, the first plunging into Xue Changshan's forehead.

"What is he doing?" People murmured, questioning. But as they glanced at Xue Changshan's icy gaze, they wisely fell silent.

Silence. Even Li Changfeng held his breath, watching Luo Tian's silver needles strike Zuo Qiuming's body. No one dared speak, fearing interruption would provoke Xue Changshan's fury.

At that moment, Luo Tian seemed to enter a unique state—like unity with heaven and earth. His eyes focused solely on Zuo Qiuming's acupoints.

Time passed slowly. After nearly half an hour, Luo Tian exhaled longingly, collapsing to the ground with a pale face.

"Help me up!" Luo Tian finally smiled, addressing Long Youlan. She didn't hesitate, supporting him.

The crackling spear emitted cold light, slicing Luo Tian's wrist. Blood imbued with divine essence and vitality flowed from his wrist, dripping onto Zuo Qiuming's pale lips.

"Big sister, open大哥's mouth!" Luo Tian gazed at Xue Yushan, addressing Xue Changshan.

Xue Yushan looked at Luo Tian's pale face before biting her lip, forcibly opening Zuo Qiuming's mouth.

Golden divine blood dripped into his mouth. Suddenly, an astonishing sight occurred: each drop caused a thunderous sound within Zuo Qiuming's body, while his fading life force gradually regenerated.

"Excellent—golden acupuncture stabilizing meridians, divine blood reviving vitality!" As Luo Tian withdrew his wrist, a aged voice with admiration echoed from the crowd. An elder stepped forward, gazing at Luo Tian with admiration.

The elder was thin, his white hair and rosy cheeks contrasting with sharp eyes. His white beard fluttered in the wind.

"Xuandan, you've finally arrived! Check if my son-in-law still has a chance!" Seeing Xuandan, Xue Changshan's eyes lit up, grabbing the frail elder.

Chapter 1810: The Exam Concludes

Xuandan, the most revered figure in Tianlong Sect, was respected for both his character and strength. Even Li Changfeng, a peer, held him in high regard.

Xuandan was the highest-ranking alchemist in the Lower Three Heavens. Six-grade immortal elixir master, known to all in the Lower Three Heavens. Only Xue Changshan, a lawless madman, dared address him so casually.

"Old madman, don't吵. Your precious son-in-law isn't dead yet!" Xuandan smiled, pulled by Xue Changshan to Zuo Qiuming's side.

"Rubbish! Look at this kid—half-dead. Last time you couldn't cure his poison, arriving too late. This time, why aren't you worried?" Xue Changshan immediately retorted.

"Young man, you're truly remarkable!" Xuandan ignored Xue's outburst, gazing at Luo Tian, who was barely supported by Long Youlan.

"In front of the elder, I've shown my clumsiness. I can only do this much!" Luo Tian weakly replied. He knew he couldn't concoct pills to save Zuo Qiuming—only Xuandan could.

"You've mastered a technique I've never seen. If not for stabilizing his life force, even I couldn't help!" Xuandan spoke softly, his admiration evident.

Everyone's eyes held disbelief. Who would have thought Luo Tian could earn such praise from Xuandan? Even the top four-grade elixir master among Xuandan's disciples hadn't received such acclaim.

"Enough. Leave it to me!" Xuandan smiled, waving his hand. A golden elixir appeared in his palm, instantly enveloping the Tianlong battlefield with powerful vitality.

"Five-grade immortal elixir!" Everyone involuntarily swallowed, their mouths watering. Five-grade elixirs were rare—few in the Lower Three Heavens could craft them.

"Administer it to him. Take him to my place for recovery, and I'll return you a lively son-in-law!" Xuandan spoke softly, handing the elixir to Xue Changshan.

"Old...Xuandan...I'll remember this favor!" Xue Changshan's eyes held gratitude. Though he was reckless, he valued fairness. Earlier, when Xue brought Zuo Qiuming to Xuandan for poison treatment, Xuandan couldn't help. Hence Xue had long called him "old bastard."

"Alright, we've all known each other for years!" Xuandan spoke softly, then gazed at Li Changfeng.

"Things are resolved. Now we can discuss this kid's future!" Xuandan turned, gazing at Li Changfeng.

"What do you think, Xuandan?" Hearing Xuandan's words, Li Changfeng's eyes flickered. He had no clue, but Xuandan, by right, held decision-making power—though he hadn't participated in years.

"I'll take him as my disciple!" Xuandan gazed at Luo Tian, causing Li Changfeng's eyes to flicker.

"Not a record disciple—direct one. No need for inner sect exams. Go directly to my place. This favor, Li Changfeng, you should grant me!" Xuandan smiled.

Hearing this, people's faces shifted, gazing at the wobbly Luo Tian. Their envy was palpable.

"That's Xuandan, the elixir master—Tianlong Sect's most esteemed figure!" Everyone's faces showed envy, secretly envying Luo Tian's fortune.

Xuandan's other intention was clear to Li Changfeng. After exchanging glances, he nodded: "Good."

"I agree to restore Zuo Qiuming's right to vie for leadership!" Li Changfeng spoke loudly, gazing at Zhang Jinghuan and others.

Hearing Li Changfeng's words, Zhang Jinghuan's face shifted. With Xuandan and Li Changfeng's support, the result was five to three—clearly their defeat.

Ke Zhenghao's face flickered with resentment, clenching his fists before regaining composure, bowing respectfully to Li Changfeng and others.

"Luo Tian, are you sure about this?" Hearing Li Changfeng's words, Zhao Tiancheng and Song Lao's faces showed reluctance, addressing Luo Tian again.

"Two elders, my decision is final. I don't wish to change it!" Luo Tian smiled, declining Zhao and Song.

"Alas..." Zhao Tiancheng sighed longingly. Though he had recruited a youth with a blood mask, he still hoped Luo Tian would join the Earth Sect.

Song Lao's frustration was greater. The Earth Sect had a youth with a blood mask, but he'd gained nothing among the twenty-plus ordinary geniuses.

"Child, will you be my disciple?" Xuandan smiled, gazing at Luo Tian. But Luo Tian's eyes rolled back, collapsing.

"Ha ha... the rest is up to you. Old monster, I'll take him for treatment first!" Xuandan smiled, extending his withered hand. He grabbed Luo Tian and Zuo Qiuming, flying toward Tianlong Mountain.

"Zhang Jinghuan, though my son-in-law lives, this isn't over!" Xue Changshan spoke. Their suspicions lingered—why had Zhang Jinghuan attacked Luo Tian?

"Alright, if no one has doubts, this disciple recruitment concludes!" Li Changfeng, though puzzled, knew it wasn't the time to discuss this.

"Master, I also choose to join Tianlong Sect!"

"Me too..." Zhang Xing and Qian Luofeng spoke up, having yet to choose a sect. They feared these elders would forget them.

"Hmm?" Hearing Zhang Xing and Qian Luofeng's words, Song Lao's face lit up. Though they weren't as outstanding as Luo Tian, they were still notable.

"You two, follow me to the Iron Sect!" Song Lao addressed them, then gazed at Li Changfeng and Zhao Tiancheng.

"Um... Master Song, I chose Tianlong Sect..." Zhang Xing cautiously observed Song Lao before speaking.

"Ridiculous! We Iron Sects have nothing, but you two are our only hope. If I don't return, it'll be hard to explain!" Song Lao didn't hesitate, grabbing them with both hands as if lifting chickens. He flew toward Tianlong Mountain's base, fearing Li Changfeng wouldn't agree.

"Remaining disciples, go to the Iron Sect!" Song Lao's voice echoed in their ears, making the twenty who chose the Iron Sect grimace. They suddenly regretted their choice.

"Let me go! I must follow my master to dominate the immortal realm!"

"Master, remember your loyal follower. Remember to rescue me at the Iron Sect!" Zhang Xing and Qian Luofeng's voices echoed down Tianlong Mountain.

"I bid farewell. Until our next meeting, the battle for heavenly qualifications—there I'll compete with all of you!" Zhao Tiancheng bowed to Li Changfeng.

"Good!" Li Changfeng nodded, watching Zhao and the other Iron Sect disciples depart.

"Close the mountain!" Seeing Zhao's group leave, Li Changfeng spoke loudly. Waves spread from his hands, enveloping the Tianlong battlefield. The massive battlefield slowly ascended toward Tianlong Mountain's peak.

Other Grand Elders also had their own thoughts, leading their disciples back to their respective peaks. The bustling selection process of Tianlong Sect had finally concluded.

"Alas... I was so close. If only my luck were better, I might have entered the three major sects!" Watching Tianlong Battlefield depart, someone lamented, cursing their bad luck.

Yet more discussions centered on Luo Tian—the youth who shone so brightly in this selection.

Luo Tian closed his eyes, allowing Xuandan to carry him into Tianlong Mountain. The massive dragon-shaped mountain's belly housed a peak, where Xuandan resided—Tianlong Sect's sacred place for alchemists and the most renowned in the Lower Three Heavens.

In truth, Luo Tian hadn't truly fainted but feigned it. First, he didn't want to hastily accept Xuandan as a master—Luo's age was considerable, and he didn't want to be taken advantage of. Second, he didn't fully know Xuandan's character. Though he'd heard stories, Luo wanted to personally assess whether Xuandan deserved being his master.

A simple courtyard, yet brimming with vitality. Xuandan led Luo Tian and Zuo Qiuming into the courtyard, then into a quiet room.

Upon entering, Xuandan placed them there. His gaze held surprise as he looked at Luo Tian.

"Truly astonishing physique—so quickly recovered!"

"Strange child. His blood also contains such strong vitality, capable of saving others!" Xuandan's eyes gleamed as he muttered.

"Buzz..." Xuandan waved his hand, a pill appearing in it. Another five-grade immortal elixir was placed into Luo Tian's mouth.

"Finally, someone worthy to inherit my teachings!" Xuandan muttered, swallowing the elixir before closing his eyes in meditation.

"Boom..." Vitality rapidly spread through Luo Tian's body. The overwhelming vitality left him awestruck—this was his first time feeling such dense vitality.

"Truly astonishing elixir!" Luo Tian muttered internally. He let the powerful vitality spread through his meridians, while his wounded body recovered at a terrifying speed.

Chapter 1811: Consideration

"Did you hear? Xuandan Master has taken a disciple!" As Luo Tian recovered, the entire Tianlong Sect—and even the Lower Three Heavens—spoke of this event.

Cities and major sects swiftly spread Luo Tian's name, reminding their disciples and elders not to oppose him.

Luo Tian's name became a sensation in the Lower Three Heavens. Those with influence knew of his existence.

"Xuandan Sect, Luo Tian! Brother! Is it your brother?" In a forest in the northern part of the Lower Three Heavens, a tall figure stood. He punched to death a beast, his body radiating fierce energy as he dragged the creature onto fire for roasting.

"Ha ha! I have a feeling this person is Luo Tian. He's become famous so quickly after entering the immortal realm!" Purple lightning flashed, a purple fox darting through the forest toward Tianlong Sect.

"Roar..." In the Chaos Sect, a golden dragon lay in a hundred-zhang-long iron cage. Hearing discussions about Luo Tian, the dragon roared violently, thrashing against the bars.

"Crack..." After fierce collisions, green lightning descended from the cage, striking the golden dragon repeatedly.

"Ha ha! Big lizard, stop resisting. This cage is forged from thunderstone—stay here quietly!" The guard saw this and laughed.

Golden scales fell, the dragon's eyes showing exhaustion before it lay down again.

"Master Yao is truly skilled. He immediately recognized the youth's true form as a dragon, capturing him!"

"Indeed! This is a Five-Claw Golden Dragon—equal to an Emperor Dragon!" The disciples marveled, discussing again.

Meanwhile, other parts of the Lower Three Heavens saw several people excitedly rising, heading toward Tianlong Sect.

Time passed slowly. Seven days later, Luo Tian's injuries had fully recovered thanks to Xuandan's elixirs.

"Good?" As Luo Tian opened his eyes, a gentle voice echoed in his ears, prompting a smile on his face.

"Thank you, Master Xuandan!" Luo Tian stood slowly, bowing respectfully to Xuandan, his eyes filled with gratitude.

"Still call me Master Xuandan?" Xuandan smiled, gazing at Luo Tian. His meaning was clear—Luo Tian should perform the拜师 ceremony.

"Master, I still need to consider this matter!" Luo Tian bowed slightly, politely declining. But recalling Xuandan's reputation as a kind-hearted old man who disliked hypocrisy, he directly refused.

"Hmm?" Hearing Luo Tian's words, even Xuandan's good nature was slightly annoyed. Who was he? The most respected in the Lower Three Heavens. To take a disciple, yet being refused.

And he had saved Luo Tian's life and treated his injuries. Even Xuandan's patience was tested.

"What do you want? Become an outer sect disciple?" Xuandan, though angry, still smiled. If Luo Tian changed his mind and knelt, he'd have a way out.

"Master, I should now be an inner sect disciple. Brother Zuo will recommend me to the inner sect under his City Lord identity." As a being older than Xuandan, Luo Tian saw Xuandan's slight annoyance. He nodded inwardly—Xuandan's temper was indeed good. If it were anyone else, they'd have exploded.

"Did you know how many people wish to be my disciple? If you become my disciple, no one in the Lower Three Heavens would dare oppose you. Your future is limitless. Even if you win the Heavenly Qualification Battle, with my six-grade alchemy reputation in the Middle Three Heavens, you'd have a promising future!" Xuandan spoke loudly, gazing at Luo Tian to discern his thoughts.

"I know, Master. You've saved my life. But I already have a master. Joining Tianlong Sect was accidental! Without my master's approval, I dare not rashly take another!" Luo Tian met Xuandan's gaze.

"Are you referring to your master from Star River Sect?" Xuandan furrowed his brow. In Luo Tian's eyes, he saw nothing—Xuandan had already seen the Star River Sect token on Luo Tian's waist, naturally guessing he was a disciple of Star River Sect.

But Xuandan didn't mind. His focus was Luo Tian's spiritual awareness, wanting to pass his alchemy skills to him—unrelated to Luo Tian's Star River Sect master.

Luo Tian said nothing, letting Xuandan guess. After all, Luo Tian would never say: "I'll test you to see if you're worthy of being my master!"

If Luo Tian said that, even Xuandan's good nature might have killed him.

"Good. Since you insist, let's make a bet? How?" Xuandan saw Luo Tian was unmoved. His eyes flickered, addressing Luo Tian.

"Provocation?" Luo Tian smiled internally, but outwardly displayed arrogance: "Master Elder, please!"

"Give you one year. In that year, study alchemy at Dan Peak. If you reach second-grade immortal elixir master status, I'll abandon taking you as a disciple. If not, be my disciple!" Xuandan saw Luo Tian's attitude and knew he'd been provoked.

"Um..."

"I'm sorry, I can't accept your bet..." Luo Tian's expression shifted, gazing at Xuandan.

"Why? Are you afraid?" Xuandan thought Luo Tian was scared. "Second-grade elixir master is nothing. You might achieve it with effort!"

"What? A three-time champion genius can't even accept this bet?" Xuandan's eyes showed disdain.

"I'm not saying that. I simply don't want to take advantage of your favor. Raise the stakes—third-grade elixir master, how about that?" Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Xuandan.

"What?" Xuandan was about to provoke Luo Tian further but was cut off by his third-grade elixir master claim.

Yet when Xuandan saw Luo Tian's eyes, he understood. In his view, Luo Tian's gaze held contempt for his bet. His anger flared.

"Child, do you think elixir masters are so easy? Second-grade immortal elixir master isn't something you achieve..." Xuandan spoke loudly, displaying all alchemists' pride—no one could belittle the elixir master profession.

"I don't mean that. I truly can achieve it, and this is a conservative estimate!" Luo Tian spoke softly, finding amusement in teasing this kind-hearted old man.

"You're lying. Even conservative—what do you think of yourself? If you become fourth-grade immortal elixir master, I've lived in vain these years!" Xuandan cursed.

"Master Elder, don't get angry. I mean, I'm already a second-grade immortal elixir master..." Luo Tian saw Xuandan's rage and quickly spoke.

"You...!"

"What?" Hearing Luo Tian's words, Xuandan stopped abruptly, gazing at him.

"You... are a second-grade immortal elixir master?" Xuandan couldn't believe his ears, thinking he'd misheard.

"Indeed. I've just ascended to it..." Luo Tian spoke softly.

"Second-grade immortal elixir master..." Xuandan's voice held disbelief. Gazing at Luo Tian, who was barely in his twenties, he couldn't believe it. At twenty, he himself had only been an apprentice.

Yet this youth was already a second-grade immortal elixir master. This stunned Xuandan.

"This is the elixir I crafted..." Luo Tian waved his hand, sending a second-grade elixir to Xuandan. Xuandan took it, eyes narrowing.

"The medicinal power is nearly condensed to the limit. Each herb's potency was perfectly refined. This technique..." Xuandan was stunned. Though it was only a second-grade elixir, his alchemy expertise wasn't exaggerated. He immediately discerned Luo Tian's refined techniques. Only someone who'd immersed in alchemy for years could create this. Even Xuandan himself would have a six or seven percent chance of failure.

"Is this really your elixir?" Xuandan's gaze held doubt. How old was Luo Tian? Even if he'd studied alchemy since birth, it had only been twenty years.

"Indeed, this is my elixir..." Luo Tian bowed slightly. In alchemy, he was always confident—especially after entering the immortal realm, knowing his goal to reach the pinnacle of alchemy in the immortal realm wouldn't be difficult.

"Fake..." Xuandan's face turned cold. He believed Luo Tian was faking, using others' elixirs to pretend they were his. After all, Luo Tian's waist bore a Star River Sect token.

"Continue the bet. Three months later, I'll host an alchemy competition. If you can still craft such elixirs, I'll lose..." Xuandan coldly snorted. At this point, Luo Tian's status in his eyes had plummeted. This deception made Xuandan look down on him.

Chapter 1812: Who Did He Offend?

After speaking, Xuandan coldly snorted and waved his sleeve, leaving the room. He left Luo Tian and Zuo Qiuming there.

"Truly... he doesn't believe a word!" Luo Tian sighed, watching Xuandan's angry back. He knew his status in Xuandan's eyes had dropped.
