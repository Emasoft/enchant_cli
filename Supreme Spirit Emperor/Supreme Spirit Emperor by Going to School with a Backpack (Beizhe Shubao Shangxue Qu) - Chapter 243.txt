“Puh…” As Luotian's power surged, hundreds more demonic shadows were annihilated by his attack, causing Nangong Liang to spit blood, his face filled with shock.

“Impossible! The myriad paths of the Dao are unbreakable. How could you annihilate so many!” Nangong Liang thought, recalling his invincible martial techniques. Two thousand Great Dao Shadows had been slain by more than half—should this continue, he would truly be wounded at his core.

“There are no absolute things in the world!” Luotian's face bore a faint smile, his eyes flashing with radiant light. He ceased attacking, his body seeming like an endless abyss as he gazed at the remaining thousand Great Dao Shadows.

“Dao gives rise to one, one gives rise to two, two to three, and three to myriad things… the three thousand paths of the Dao are but one path’s evolution!” Luotian's eyes snapped shut, and in an instant he attained profound enlightenment.

“I have suffered for a reason; all things are governed by cause and effect, and these can be called Dao!” Luotian spoke aloud, his mouth opening wide as if a black hole, sending out invisible waves.

Though none felt the disturbance, the thousand dark shadows seemed drawn by an unseen force, sucked into Luotian’s body.

“Wujie gives rise to Taiji, Taiji to Yin-Yang, Yin-Yang to the Three Powers, Three Powers to Four Symbols….” Luotian murmured softly, his eyes clearer than before, a sense of calculation flickering within them.

“Sudden enlightenment! This brat is too reckless! He’s entered sudden enlightenment—how many great sages in history have yearned for such a moment? The benefits of sudden enlightenment are indescribable. If he unlocks something transcendent, his future achievements would be boundless.”

“Ah…” As Luotian absorbed the thousand shadows into his body, Nangong Liang howled in agony from above, clutching his head as blood gushed forth.

Luotian’s face bore a faint smile. At this moment, his entire being seemed to undergo a miraculous transformation; every movement carried the essence of Dao and principle.

He clenched his fists, golden Daoic resonance flowing over them. Glowing runes naturally emerged from his body, intertwining with the essence of Dao and principle.

He leapt into motion, appearing silently before Nangong Liang, who clutched his head in anguish. Luotian struck with a single fist.

Though unassuming, the punch carried the aura of Dao—its overwhelming presence made even the heart tremble.

Two thousand shadows devoured by Luotian had inflicted massive damage on Nangong Liang, but as a late-stage Sage, he suppressed his pain and struck back with a punch. The clash between Luotian’s unassuming strike and Nangong Liang’s power sent shockwaves through the sky.

“Crack…” Thunder erupted, the black heavens shattering under their collision. Nangong Liang’s aged arm crumbled into fragments, spreading across his body.

“Stop!” Nangong Liang roared, watching his arm turn to flesh and bone, reduced to pulp as if crushed by a meat grinder.

Nangong Liang now trembled in terror, realizing he could not resist the Dao’s corruption. He helplessly watched his body disintegrate.

Three heartbeats passed. Under the terrified gazes of all, Nangong Liang’s aged body crumbled completely, vanishing from sight.

“One punch, shattering a late-stage Sage!” The Demon Clan gasped, their faces etched with awe. They stared at Luotian, stunned by his terrifying power after sudden enlightenment.

“Indeed, a prodigy who attained sudden enlightenment! He’s grasped the aura of Dao. Though not fully mastered, his power is staggering. If he masters it entirely, combined with the Reincarnation Body, how formidable would Luotian be!” Nangong Bo’s face bore admiration as he gazed at Luotian, knowing he was likely no match for him now.

Zheng Xin, Gu Lei, and Nangong Yuqing, the young ones, also bore expressions of admiration. Even with his cultivation blocked, Luotian remained astonishingly powerful.

“This move was cultivated within the Demon Clan—it shall be called the Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist!” Luotian smiled, watching the slowly coalescing blood of Nangong Liang, on the verge of regenerating.

“Want to regenerate with blood?” Luotian’s eyes flashed, his hands weaving golden rune chains that swiftly covered the flesh.

“Sizzle…” White smoke rose from the flesh, as if a gray shadow writhed beneath the rune chains, howling in agony.

“Stop!” Several late-stage Sage elders soared forward, their bodies radiating fierce energy. One elder brandished a pseudo-Era Relic.

Nangong Liang was their leader; if he died, they would lose their anchor, possibly crumbling like the followers of Nangong De after his death.

“Get lost!” Luotian coldly spoke, lightning flashing in his eyes as he glared at them. His golden Dao Bow reappeared, arrows凝聚 at the tip.

At the same time, Nangong Bo soared into battle, standing like an eagle before Luotian. His sharp eyes scanned the elders.

Nangong Kai and another elder also leapt forward, standing beside Nangong Bo and Luotian. Clearly, they would not stand by if conflict arose.

The elders halted, their faces grim. Two of them showed hesitation—Luotian’s past victories were too terrifying; even Nangong Liang’s fate was so grim. With Nangong Bo and Nangong Kai, two late-stage Sages, at his side, they had no chance.

“No chance!” The elders communicated telepathically, attempting to discuss a plan against Nangong Bo. But after a brief exchange, they found no solution.

“Who dares challenge me?” Luotian spoke slowly, his gaze sweeping over the elders.

“Challenging your mother!” The elders mentally cursed. Even Nangong Liang, who wielded two Sage Relics, had perished at Luotian’s hands. What chance did they have? To kill Luotian, three late-stage Sages would need to attack without regard for their lives—otherwise, no opportunity.

The Demon Clan’s disciples fell silent but knew this was none of their concern. Regardless of who led the clan, life would continue normally. Yet seeing an outsider subdue the elders left them uneasy but powerless; with three late-stage Sage ancestors silent, they had no say.

Chapter 1050: Resolution

On the Demon Clan’s arena, tension thickened as disciples watched the confrontation.

“Have you decided? If no one challenges us, we’ll be leaving!” Luotian extended his hand into the void. Nangong Liang’s flesh finally turned to white smoke, vanishing from sight.

The Demon Clan leader had perished at Luotian’s hands. If this spread, it would be a major disgrace for the Demon Clan—three disciples and a clan leader all slain by Luotian.

“Boom…” The Thousand Mechanism Heaven Umbrella and the Demon Emperor Tower fell to the ground, thundering. The elders snapped back to reality.

“Pseudo-Era Relic!” Their gazes fell on the two relics, eyes gleaming.

The third elder waved his hand, recalling the Demon Emperor Tower to his grasp. Seeing the elders’ intense stares, he coldly snorted, directing them to avert their eyes. He then focused on the Thousand Mechanism Heaven Umbrella.

With Nangong Liang’s death, it had become leaderless, stirring ambition among the disciples.

“Clan Leader, if you hand over the Thousand Mechanism Heaven Umbrella to us, we’ll fully obey you. We promise no trouble for this boy!” One elder spoke, his tone laced with threat.

“Dreaming too high!” Luotian sneered, snatching the umbrella and handing it to Nangong Bo.

Nangong Bo accepted without hesitation. He knew seizing the clan would not be simple; he’d face endless troubles. He needed a pseudo-Era Relic.

“Do you dare rebel? You must wait for the clan ceremony to challenge me!” Nangong Bo’s eyes flashed confidence. He was certain he could suppress these late-stage elders.

Hearing Nangong Bo’s words, the elders’ faces darkened—truthfully, it was so. With three ancestors speaking, no one could object.

“Clan Leader, be wise!” The elders glared at Nangong Bo before departing.

Some neutral elders bore enigmatic expressions, bowing to Nangong Bo before vanishing from Luotian’s group. They would wait for the clan leader’s final decision.

“Everyone, disperse! All returns to normal!” Nangong Bo smiled, dismissing the Demon Clan disciples. He sighed deeply; half of Nangong De’s revenge was complete.

“Divine Clan!” Nangong Bo murmured, gazing at the void. Now that Nangong Liang was dead, he would eradicate Nangong Liang’s faction. Then only the Divine Clan remained—those who had conspired against Nangong De.

“Resolved!” Zheng Xin’s group bore relief, though some troubles remained. With Nangong Bo and Nangong Yuqing’s strength, they could likely handle it.

Though resolved, the entire Demon Clan buzzed with talk of this major upheaval. The clan leader’s change was a significant event for the Divine and Demon Realm.

Three days passed, and the Divine and Demon Realm erupted in a storm. The news of the Demon Clan’s leader change spread widely, prompting many sects to approach the Demon Clan—first to forge ties with the new clan leader, second to gauge their next move. After all, Nangong Liang had commanded many loyal sects.

For three days, Nangong Bo and Nangong Yuqing, the new clan leader and disciple, were overwhelmed, leaving no time to bother Luotian’s group. This left them bored; the Demon Clan disciples regarded them like plague carriers, their hostility making it hard for Luotian’s group to stay.

Yet during these three days, Luotian’s group thoroughly studied the Demon Clan’s ancient texts. After all, Luotian had another pressing matter: crafting a Reincarnation Elixir for Sun Mengru to regain her past-life memories.

After scouring the texts, they found a clue—pointing to one of the Nine Absolute Wastes: the Divine and Demon Ancient Cave.

“Damn! How could a sacred herb be in the Divine and Demon Cave? How am I supposed to pluck it!” Zheng Xin cursed.

Luotian smiled wryly but soon bore a determined look: “No matter how dangerous, I must check. I’ll try!”

Luotian’s group stayed three more days until Nangong Bo and Yuqing fully adapted to their roles. They then departed, telling them they’d return for the ancestral rites to ensure Nangong Bo solidified his position.

As they left, Jiang Nanxuan and Wan Lingkong handed Nangong Yuqing and Nangong Bo the remaining main flags of the Ten Thousand Heavens Punishment Array, leaving them a final card.

Under the cautious gazes of the Demon Clan disciples, Luotian’s group strode confidently out of the Demon Realm.

A day or two after their departure, Luotian’s presence in the Divine and Demon Realm spread. The realm’s inhabitants were stunned; many sects formed plans, especially those with late-stage Sage masters.

But as the sects plotted, the new Demon Clan leader issued a statement: “Luotian is our guest. Who dares harm him, they defy the Demon Clan!”

This statement silenced many sects. The Demon Clan was second only to the Divine Clan in power, a top-tier force despite recent decline. Their three late-stage Sages ensured surrounding sects were terrified, daring no open defiance.

The Divine and Demon Cave lay at the boundary between the two forces, acting as a natural divide. Since ancient times, both factions had designated it as their border.

Even with Luotian’s group’s speed, reaching the Divine and Demon Cave would take days.

Yet Luotian had another plan: to visit the Divine Clan’s territory, hoping to chance upon Sun Mengru. Even if he failed, gathering news of her was possible.

The group wasn’t in a hurry, leisurely traveling through the Demon Clan’s domain. No one dared trouble them; Luotian’s fame was known—many late-stage Sages had perished at his hands. Without a late-stage Sage’s strength, who would dare attack?

They admired the Demon Clan’s scenery while heading toward the Divine and Demon Cave. Yet along the way, Luotian felt an inexplicable pull from his Daoic enlightenment, a faint yet persistent thread around them. This made him wary.

“Who is it?” Luotian furrowed his brow, recalling those he’d offended. But upon reflection, he was speechless—too many to count.

Yet the opponent clearly feared Luotian’s strength, refraining from action. The faint thread followed him relentlessly.

That day, as Luotian’s group exited a continent and entered the star domain, they saw a streak of light approaching.

“Powerful! Late-stage Sage!” Zheng Xin’s group tensed, but soon relaxed—evidently no attack. The streak passed over their heads, flying away.

Luotian furrowed his brow. Upon seeing the streak, he felt an intense familiarity. He stood still, extending his spiritual sense to identify who it was.

“Luotian!” Before he could confirm, a sweet voice echoed in his ears, making his face light up with joy.

How could he forget that voice? At the same time, his spiritual sense revealed the figure within the streak—his face lit with excitement.

The streak flashed, returning to Luotian’s group. A graceful figure appeared before them.

Her dark hair flowed, a few strands drifting across her pale forehead. Her face was pallid, exuding an otherworldly beauty.

“Sun Mengru!” Luotian recognized her by voice alone—his longed-for Divine Clan goddess, Sun Mengru, reborn as Chen Yunting.

Luotian never expected to meet her here. Yet his face turned icy in an instant.

Sun Mengru was in dire straits, her lips stained with dried blood. Her robes were torn, her face deathly pale—clearly severely wounded. Her breath was unstable, sweat constantly dripping from her forehead.

“How come you’re here!” They both spoke in unison, their voices laced with confusion. Neither expected to meet the other here.

“Wait for later—let’s go!” Sun Mengru’s face shifted, urging them as her voice carried urgency. Her eyes also held fierce determination.

“Hey, little beauty, where do you think you’re going? No one can save you today. You’ll never escape my grasp!” As Sun Mengru’s words faded, a shrill voice echoed in their ears.

Chapter 1051: The Hepian Sect

In the Demon Clan’s domain, under endless stars, Luotian gazed at Sun Mengru’s pitiful state, his eyes brimming with killing intent.

“Sun Mengru?” Wan Lingkong and Gu Lei, seeing her pitiful state, recognized her. Though they hadn’t entered the Ancient Palace of the Ancients, they knew Sun Mengru—the Divine Clan’s goddess. How could she be so pitiful? In the Divine and Demon Realm, who dared attack her? This boldness astounded them.

“Go! Not the place to talk!” Sun Mengru’s eyes flickered, though she’d heard of Luotian’s strength. Yet she still worried he might not be the one to chase her enemies.

Luotian’s eyes bore pity, watching her speak—each word brought blood from her lips. His killing intent deepened; Sun Mengru was his taboo. Who dared harm her, he would fight to the death.

“Hey, little beauty, where do you think you’re going? No one can save you today. You’ll never escape my grasp!” As Sun Mengru’s words faded, a shrill voice echoed in their ears.

Three figures appeared before Luotian’s group.

“Chased them?” Sun Mengru’s face paled, clenching her fists and unleashing the River of Mountains and Rivers. But as she opened it, she coughed blood—before activating the Heavenly Mechanism Diagram, her face grew even paler.

“You’re poisoned?” Luotian sensed her abnormal state and grabbed her, his spiritual sense entering her body.

In an instant, his spiritual sense reached her dantian, where it seemed devoured by something—a black worm continuously devouring her sacred energy.

“Ah! If not poisoned, I wouldn’t be so pitiful!” Sun Mengru nodded slightly, her eyes cold as she gazed at the three figures before them.

“Damn!” Zheng Xin and Gu Lei, upon seeing the three, cursed loudly, their eyes wide with shock.

Luotian handed Sun Mengru a pill—though it couldn’t fully neutralize the poison, it could suppress it.

Sun Mengru didn’t refuse; if she didn’t control the black worm, her cultivation might be entirely devoured.

After Sun Mengru took the pill and her complexion improved slightly, Luotian turned, his gaze cold as he faced the three who had chased her.

But upon turning, he felt nausea and instinctively averted his gaze.

“Vomit…” Zheng Xin, Wan Lingkong, and Gu Lei grimaced, unable to hold back their nausea. Jiang Nanxuan’s face was pale, clearly restraining himself.

“What the hell is this!” Luotian felt that sense upon seeing the leader.

He was too ugly—though the other two were somewhat better, the leader’s face was unbearable.

From his general shape, he resembled a humanoid, but upon seeing his face, one would doubt if he was human or a beast.

His ears were large, like pig ears, drooping on either side of his head. His nose was like a dog’s, and his mouth hung out, drooling uncontrollably. His face was covered with unkempt fur.

“Monster, what are you?” Zheng Xin asked, his voice laced with curiosity.

The leader glared at them, his black eyes flashing coldly. He hated being called a monster and despised those who vomited upon seeing him—those people had all been killed by him.

“Hmph…” The monster grunted, perhaps not wanting to sound like a pig but unable to help it. He glared at Zheng Xin and spoke coldly: “Who are you? Don’t interfere, or you’ll suffer.”

“Indeed, hand over the girl to our prince. Otherwise, you’ll die painfully!” The two subordinates shouted, their eyes greedy as they gazed at Sun Mengru.

“Prince? You’re a prince? Which sect are you from? Daring to abduct the Divine Clan’s goddess!” Zheng Xin forced down his nausea, asking. He had already smelled a foul odor entering his nose, making his stomach churn again.

“Damn! How long haven’t you bathed!” Gu Lei cursed, never expecting such a “person” to exist.

“I’m not important which sect I’m from. The Divine Clan’s goddess? I’ve bedded many women, but never the Divine Clan’s goddess! And today, it’s her!” The monster’s face bore hatred as he gazed at Sun Mengru.

“I’ll not only take her, but all the Divine Clan! I’ll harvest their essence to refine my cultivation!” The monster extended his tongue, drooling uncontrollably.

Luotian furrowed his brow, sensing the three’s cultivation levels. His eyes showed surprise—the monster, though grotesque, had formidable strength. This surprised Luotian.

The two subordinates also possessed late-stage Sage cultivation, which stunned Luotian. He had met many princes and princesses, but none with late-stage Sage strength—this was his first encounter.

“Is he the ‘waiting by the wall for red apricot’?” Wan Lingkong’s eyes bore recollection, then shifted to disbelief.

“Haha! You’ve heard of our prince’s name? Then hand over the goddess quickly, or you’ll know your fate!” The subordinates saw Luotian’s group was at most late-stage Sage, so they were unafraid.

“Waiting by the wall for red apricot? What a name!” Zheng Xin and others wondered, looking at Wan Lingkong. He was a native of the Divine and Demon Realm, his ancestors once glorious—clearly he knew something.

“Waiting by the wall for red apricot is his nickname. He’s a notorious flower-hunter who rose to fame in the Divine and Demon Realm. People suspect he’s a descendant of the Hepian Sect! Do you know what the Hepian Sect is?” Wan Lingkong’s face bore disgust.

“Hepian Sect?” Luotian’s group grimaced, having read about it in the Demon Clan’s ancient texts.

The Hepian Sect was chaotic—its members were all flower-hunters, skilled in dual-cultivation. They targeted sects’ princes and princesses, stealing their essence to strengthen themselves. Their audacity was unmatched; no one could control them.

As the sect grew, so did their ambitions. A generation’s princess dared to target the Divine Clan’s prince and nearly succeeded.

If not for the Divine Clan’s old king foreseeing it, they would have suffered a major setback.

This enraged the Divine Clan’s king, who unleashed a massacre of millions. The old king personally summoned great powers from the Star Realm to expose all Hepian Sect bases. With his own hands, he eradicated this repulsive sect.

Yet the king didn’t stop there; he captured the princess who attacked his prince, then had a group of lustful pigs and dogs maul her, stripping her cultivation. He left her to their mercy without further care.

No one knew if the princess survived—people assumed she couldn’t.

But years ago, a flower-hunter rose to fame across the Divine and Demon Realm under the nickname “Waiting by the wall for red apricot.” His methods mirrored those of the Hepian Sect, yet no one could catch him. No one knew his real name—only that he was grotesque, like a monster.

Luotian, Gu Lei, Zheng Xin, and Jiang Nanxuan grimaced at the monster’s appearance—pig ears, dog nose, eyes filled with disbelief.

“Is this the one who was the Hepian Sect’s princess…? No way!” Zheng Xin and others raised goosebumps. Sun Mengru was pale-faced.

“You’ll die!” The monster’s face bore ferocity, his grotesque mouth making it even more terrifying.

“It seems about right—angry and defensive. My god, I’ve learned something new! What a thing!” Zheng Xin’s group couldn’t bear it. They never expected such a thing to exist.

“Kill them!” The monster, having had his wound exposed, was enraged. He roared at Wan Lingkong, charging forward.

“Kill!” The subordinates also grimaced, their bodies moving to attack Luotian’s group. They knew this master was mentally unstable—after such a background, his personality would be twisted. Anyone daring to mention it would be tortured to death. And Wan Lingkong had fully exposed his past.

Luotian’s killing intent surged. The thought of Sun Mengru falling into their hands made him shudder, unable to continue thinking.

“You’ll all die! The Divine Clan’s king eradicated your Hepian Sect; today, I, Luotian, will eradicate this repulsive sect!” Luotian raged, his blood boiling. His crackling spear hummed as he charged at the monster.

Chapter 1052: Corrosion

In the Demon Clan’s domain, under endless stars, Luotian transformed into a golden streak, charging at the half-pig, half-dog, half-human monster.

“Kid, what are you? A late-stage Sage? Daring to be arrogant before me!” The monster’s face twisted with rage, gazing at Luotian charging toward him. His body radiated green energy, a foul odor filling the stars.

At the same time, the monster transformed into a streak of light, not using weapons. His fur-covered fists thundered toward Luotian.

“Boom…” In an instant, Luotian collided with the monster. His golden spear tip met the monster’s fist, sending shockwaves outward.

“Hmm?” Luotian retreated, his eyes wary. He gazed at the fur-covered fist struck by his spear—unscathed. His surprise was immense.

“Strong physique!” Everyone shivered. This monster, though neither human nor beast, had undeniable strength. Luotian’s spear struck it—yet it remained unharmed. This was the first time anyone had seen such a thing.

Luotian’s strength was known—late-stage Sages died at his hands. Yet this monster remained unscathed. Such a physique could match Luotian.

“Buzz…” The crackling spear hummed, its tip bearing a spot of blood—a nauseating sensation permeated Luotian’s mind.

Luotian was speechless; the spear had become sentient, and even a drop of the monster’s blood made it feel nauseous. Its mind was不满.

The monster sensed Luotian’s difference, having clashed with him without injury. It knew its physique was formidable. This time, a regular late-stage Sage would have been severely injured—but Luotian stood unharmed. Though he used a weapon, it was not something ordinary. This made the monster’s black eyes scrutinize Luotian closely.

“You’re Luotian!” The monster’s eyes flashed with light, shifting from shock to joy.

“Haha! After searching endlessly, I found you—possessing the body of a Divine Clan goddess and encountering the Reincarnation Body’s Luotian. Heaven has been kind! If I capture you and give you to my mother, she’ll be delighted. No wonder your aura is so strong, your physique so powerful!” The monster laughed, his eyes filled with greed.

“Go to hell!” Luotian shivered, moving forward again.

This time, he no longer tested; he didn’t use his spear. His fists glowed with golden light, Dao and principle intertwining within them. The Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist struck the monster.

Though Luotian loathed the monster, he had no choice—relying solely on his spear, he knew he couldn’t defeat this monster.

“Soul of the Dead!” The monster, seeing Luotian’s overwhelming aura, showed concern. After all, Luotian was renowned across the nine realms—stronger than most late-stage Sages.

Green energy radiated from the monster’s body, enveloping it and making it more terrifying—like a demon from hell. Especially the drooling saliva, which made people shudder.

In an instant, two streaks collided—golden and green. Their fists clashed, thunderous explosions shaking the void. Lightning erupted from the sky, striking around them.

Sun Mengru stood pale, worry etched on her face as she watched the battle. Zheng Xin and Gu Lei fought against the monster’s two subordinates, but their situation was dire—opponents were late-stage Sages. They were only early-stage Sages; without Luotian’s prior gift of the Era Bell and Spirit Transport Vessel, they might have already lost.

Sun Mengru, poisoned, had weakened—she was no match for a late-stage Sage. If not for her unique Divine Clan body, she might have already fallen into the monster’s grasp.

Dao energy spread rapidly, instantly corroding the monster’s arm. Two streaks retreated tens of thousands of feet apart, gazing at each other.

“Ah…” A pig-like scream echoed through the stars as the monster’s entire arm crumbled.

“Truly strong physique!” Cracks appeared on Luotian’s arm, his entire limb losing sensation. He silently marveled at the monster’s strength.

Luotian had unleashed his full power—late-stage Sages like Nangong Liang were shattered by this punch. Yet the monster had only lost an arm. This astonished Luotian.

“You’ve grown stronger!” Sun Mengru gazed at Luotian standing proudly in the stars, her face bearing admiration.

The monster’s physique was formidable—she had felt it before. Even she admitted slight inferiority. Yet Luotian had shattered the monster’s arm with one punch, proving his strength had increased tenfold since their meeting in the Ancient Palace of the Ancients.

“Kill!” Luotian gave no time to breathe, his other fist clenching. The Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist danced again, and the Buddha’s Heaven Attack was infused into it. This was Luotian’s peak punch—five times the Dao energy, shaking the entire starfield as it attacked the monster.

“Indeed, a prodigy renowned across the nine realms! You have skill, but do you think I’m called ‘Waiting by the wall for red apricot’ in vain? For years, many sects have tried to kill me—none succeeded. Do you think I have no other methods?” The monster’s eyes flashed with ferocity, his mouth opening wide. He spat a stream of green saliva, a foul odor spreading through the stars instantly. In an instant, it flowed like a river, covering the starfield.

The saliva’s corrosive power radiated, as if devouring the entire starfield, revealing vast gray areas.

“Damn! What is this!” Zheng Xin and others, even protected by the Era Bell and Spirit Transport Vessel, smelled the foul odor. Their stomachs churned uncontrollably.

“Fool! You’ll never escape!” The monster roared, his hands weaving green runes into the saliva. It surged instantly, filling the starfield. Even Zheng Xin and others in battle were affected, quickly using the Era Bell and Spirit Transport Vessel to protect themselves.

“Damn! What is this!” Zheng Xin’s group, even protected by the Era Bell and Spirit Transport Vessel, smelled the foul odor. Their stomachs churned uncontrollably.
