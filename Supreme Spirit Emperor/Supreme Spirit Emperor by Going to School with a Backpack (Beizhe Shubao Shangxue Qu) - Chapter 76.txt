Jiang Nanxuan sat cross-legged on a cushion, while Jiang Nanxuan held an array of metal-gleaming banners in his hands. He continuously inserted them into the four directions, scattering them across the bamboo grove.

Jiang Nanxuan was merely an ordinary person, so inserting the array banners took him considerably longer. After about an hour, he finally placed one hundred and seven banners at various corners of the bamboo grove. One banner remained in his hand.

He took a deep breath, signaling Luo Tian and the others to retreat from the bamboo grove into the courtyard. Jiang Nanxuan's eyes gleamed with a faint smile as he gently inserted the final banner into the ground.

"Replenish Life and Return Qi Array! Open!" Jiang Nanxuan's voice carried a calm tone.

Chapter 372: Meng Yao's Origin (Meng Yao)

Chapter 372: Meng Yao's Origin

As Jiang Nanxuan's words and the array banners fell simultaneously, the entire bamboo grove suddenly became lush with greenery. A gentle breeze swept through, causing the tall bamboo stalks to sway slightly as if imbued with life.

"Forgive me, everyone. I must borrow some of your vitality to save my friend!" Jiang Nanxuan's face bore a faint expression of guilt as he murmured softly.

"Rustle... rustle..." As if understanding Jiang Nanxuan's words, the bamboo grove emitted a crisp sound.

A steady flow of green vitality continuously withdrew from the bamboo stalks, flowing toward Duan Xingchen who sat cross-legged on the cushion.

Luo Tian's gaze carried a touch of admiration, his mind marveling at the array's profound intricacy. Having mastered the essence of wood energy, he could clearly perceive that this array was siphoning the vitality of the entire bamboo grove to nourish Duan Xingchen.

Though each bamboo contributed only a small amount of vitality, the grove contained tens of thousands of stalks. Combined with the life energy from the grass and other living things on the ground, this collective vitality was substantial.

"Let's go. After seven days, Duan Xingchen will naturally regain his vitality. Next, let's examine your Nirvana Dragon Seal!" Jiang Nanxuan's eyes gleamed with excitement as he gazed at Luo Tian's wrist.

For some reason, Luo Tian felt uneasy under Jiang Nanxuan's gaze, who possessed no energy. He instinctively shrank his neck.

The group slowly entered the bamboo house. Though small, the courtyard had several rooms. Jiang Nanxuan arranged for Meng Yao to settle Zheng Xin and Leng Qiuchan, while he led Luo Tian into a small room.

"If I'm not mistaken, you have a close connection with the dragon clan, right? This is my first time hearing that the Dragon Emperor's reverse scale was given to a human. I never expected you to know the current Dragon Emperor!" Jiang Nanxuan smiled lightly as he spoke.

Hearing Jiang Nanxuan's words, Luo Tian's gaze slightly narrowed. He knew Jiang Nanxuan was intelligent but hadn't expected him to deduce the Dragon Sword's existence.

"Don't worry. I just need your help with something. After you break the seal, when you return to Dian'an Forest, I ask you to beg for a drop of the Dragon Emperor's blood. I have great use for it—no need for refined blood, just ordinary blood will do!" Jiang Nanxuan's face showed a rare trace of anxiety.

"Jiang Xiong, could you explain what this great use is?" Luo Tian hadn't expected Jiang Nanxuan to deduce the Dragon Sword's location in Dian'an Forest. Cautious as he was, Luo Tian wouldn't casually seek the Dragon Emperor's blood without reason. If someone obtained this drop of blood, they could achieve much through it.

"Frankly speaking, you've also seen Meng Yao, right? I'm doing this for her..." Jiang Nanxuan's face bore a bitter expression as he explained why he sought that drop of dragon blood, leaving Luo Tian stunned.

It turned out Meng Yao was no ordinary person. Her identity was the granddaughter of an ancient master from Yuling Sect who had reached the soul-fragment stage. At one year old, this ancient master had obtained a strange egg from somewhere.

The old man mistakenly believed it was an egg of a divine bird and, in a sudden whim, used Yuling Sect's special sealing techniques to imprison the egg within Meng Yao. This was a symbiotic seal similar to the Nirvana Dragon Seal, but unlike the Nirvana Dragon Seal, Meng Yao's was a master-subordinate relationship.

After being imprisoned within Meng Yao, the egg remained peaceful for years. Her cultivation speed was astonishingly fast, especially her control over fire energy, which reached an extreme level. By fifteen, she had already attained the initial stage of bone-formation. Her progress was truly astonishing.

At eighteen, Meng Yao had reached the peak of bone-formation, which greatly pleased her grandfather. However, on her eighteenth birthday—the eighteenth year since the egg was sealed within her—something unexpected happened.

That day, Meng Yao's body became scorching hot, as if roasted by fire. Her body radiated terrifying heat, and faintly, one could hear the sound of a call within her seal.

Her grandfather realized that the egg had changed, and he decided to break the seal immediately to see what was happening.

When the seal broke, her grandfather was completely stunned. The egg indeed contained a divine bird—but one that exceeded his expectations.

"Shadow Phoenix..." Her grandfather had never imagined the egg contained a legendary Shadow Phoenix, a race that rivaled the dragon clan.

Legends say that when a Shadow Phoenix is born, it burns everything around it. Her grandfather had no choice but to burn his entire soul-fragment stage cultivation to reseal the Shadow Phoenix within Meng Yao, preventing it from escaping.

However, this act cost him his cultivation and effectively ended his lifespan. He passed away shortly after.

In recent years, Meng Yao had no major issues, but Jiang Nanxuan noticed that the seal on her body was beginning to break on its own. Especially when she fought, it became even more apparent. To ensure safety, Jiang Nanxuan used his knowledge of seals to imprison all of Meng Yao's cultivation.

"So, the thing that needs to break Meng Yao's crisis is Dragon Emperor's blood?" Luo Tian's eyes showed confusion as he asked.

"Indeed, after extensive research, only blood of the same level as a true dragon can do this. With some special methods, I'm confident I can completely eliminate the crisis within Meng Yao's body!" Jiang Nanxuan's face showed hope as he looked at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian pondered for a moment before saying, "Jiang Da Ge, if what you said is true, I can help. Even more, I could help you obtain blood from a dragon clan higher than the Dragon Emperor in Dian'an Forest. However, since this is significant, I need you to swear an oath of blood. Otherwise, I can't help with this. Even if you don't open the Nirvana Dragon Seal for me, I won't let my friend suffer harm without reason!"

Hearing Luo Tian's answer, Jiang Nanxuan was stunned. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to have blood even higher than the Dragon Emperor's. For something as critical as Meng Yao's life, a simple blood oath was nothing!

"But Jiang Xiong, you need to break the seal first. Otherwise, if you want blood, it'll take about twenty days. After all, the blood comes from that little creature within my seal!" Luo Tian chuckled lightly.

Chapter 373: Who is the Young Master?

Chapter 373: Who is the Young Master?

In the bamboo grove courtyard, within the wooden house.

Luo Tian sat cross-legged on a cushion, his body surrounded by various inscriptions carved into the wooden floor. A fragrant aroma emanated from the countless symbols.

Luo Tian extended one hand, and his Nirvana Dragon Seal was vividly imprinted on his wrist. Strangely, Luo Tian's entire body was covered with countless silver needles. His energy fluctuations continuously converged from all directions.

Jiang Nanxuan stood at the door, whispering to Luo Tian who sat cross-legged with his eyes closed: "Using the method of acupuncture, I've fully activated your potential. Through the power of the symbols, I'll tear apart the Dragon Seal. I've done everything I could. The rest is up to you. If successful, after being suppressed for so long, your cultivation might even surge another level!"

After speaking, Jiang Nanxuan didn't leave immediately. Instead, he sat cross-legged at the door because there was still one task left: when the Dragon Seal tore apart, he would help Luo Tian cover the Dragon Emperor's reverse scale over the torn gap. Only then could it be considered complete, and the dragon baby sealed within Luo Tian would be fully released. Through the connection of the symbols on the seal, it could continue to survive.

Luo Tian sat cross-legged, naturally hearing Jiang Nanxuan's words. Earlier, Jiang Nanxuan had roughly explained how to break the seal. The only thing Luo Tian needed to do was to absorb the surrounding energy through his cultivation method and break the seal. Once he succeeded, it would be complete.

Thinking this through, Luo Tian's Five Elements Transcendent Cultivation method surged into action. The surrounding energy rushed toward him like a flood, and through the stimulation of acupuncture, his ability to absorb energy had reached an astonishing level. The already denser energy in this region poured into Luo Tian's body like a tide.

Jiang Nanxuan sighed with admiration at the speed of Luo Tian's energy absorption before sitting cross-legged on the ground, waiting for Luo Tian's breakthrough.

...

At the moment when Luo Tian was fully pushing against the Nirvana Dragon Seal, Leng Hongcai sat in a grand hall with a grim expression. Below him stood over a dozen elders of the soul-fragment stage, and behind them were dozens of young people. The atmosphere was somewhat cold.

"Leng Zongzhu, before you went to unite disciples, we discussed with you about the matter. Have you considered it?" After a moment of silence, an elderly man with white hair looked at Leng Hongcai and asked.

"Consider what? You've heard the news so quickly, do I need to tell you?" Leng Hongcai's eyes flashed like lightning across the dozen elders.

"Indeed, I've heard some news. That's why I came to confirm it personally!" Another elder smiled lightly and said.

"Indeed, the news you heard is true. I've betrothed Qiuchan to Luo Tian of the Northern Five Elements Sect. Since you've all arrived today, I'll announce it now—Luo Tian is our Yuling Sect's Young Master! Once I reach the soul-fragment stage, the position of Zongzhu will be his!" Leng Hongcai's gaze was cold and unyielding, no longer the amiable old man he had been. His voice carried a dominant tone.

"Zongzhu, allowing someone from the Northern Five Elements Sect to be our Young Master? This might not be appropriate!"

"Yes, although the Five Elements Sect is known as the top sect of Tianyuan, everyone knows it's just because they have more people. In terms of strength, they still fall short of our Yuling Sect!" After Leng Hongcai's words, the grand hall immediately erupted in chaos. All the elders began to criticize Leng Hongcai.

"Hmph! I've already decided this. Also, you all know that I've verbally betrothed Qiuchan to Luo Tian. So Luo Tian is already half a Yuling Sect member! You shouldn't covet this position anymore!" Leng Hongcai's face flashed with coldness, his gaze fierce as he looked at them.

The elders' faces showed fear. Leng Hongcai had always been seen as kind and forgiving, rarely punishing those who made major mistakes. This had led them to not take Leng Hongcai seriously.

The elders had never seen Leng Hongcai so强势 before. Suddenly, they remembered that he was just one step away from reaching the soul-fragment peak.

"Also, this is the elders' opinion. If you have any objections, go discuss it with them instead of complaining to me!" Leng Hongcai saw the elders staring blankly and waved his sleeve fiercely, walking out of the hall.

"Elders!"

"Did Leng Hongcai mean those reclusive old masters?" Leng Hongcai's words echoed in the elders' hearts, causing them to be shocked.

"This matter needs further consideration," the eldest elder said softly and then stepped out of the hall.

As this elder left, others also glanced at each other with thoughts and slowly exited the hall.

After the elders left, only a group of young people remained staring at each other in confusion. They were the sons or grandsons of these elders.

"What's going on?"

"Qiuchan is to marry that Luo Tian?"

"No way, it's absolutely not allowed!" Several young men showed anger in their eyes. To have Qiuchan marry someone they considered an outsider was hard for them to accept.

"Where is Luo Tian? He's been named Young Master! I want to see what qualifications he has to be the Young Master!"

"Yes, defeat him and see what face he has left in Yuling Sect!"

"He's just had some good performance during the joint recruitment, and now he's being so valued!" Dozens of young men shouted loudly.

"Find him, drive Luo Tian out of Yuling Sect!" Dozens of young men with battle intent stepped out of the hall, beginning to use their connections to find Luo Tian's whereabouts.

Luo Tian didn't know that he had become a thorn in the eyes of Yuling Sect's young elders without realizing it.

Even if Luo Tian knew these people were searching for him, he had no time to care.

At this moment, Luo Tian's energy points were all open, and a swirling vortex of energy hovered above his head in the wooden house.

The black symbols previously carved by Jiang Nanxuan on the ground flowed slowly, gathering toward Luo Tian's body.

Luo Tian's face was covered in sweat, dripping onto the wooden floor with a clear sound.

Jiang Nanxuan was already somewhat exhausted, as he had no energy and wasn't a cultivator. After being replaced by Zheng Xin, he went to rest nearby. As long as Luo Tian tore open the Nirvana Dragon Seal, Jiang Nanxuan would use the Dragon Emperor's reverse scale to repair the damaged seal.

Chapter 374: What to Do?

Chapter 374: What to Do?

A week passed.

During this time, Luo Tian absorbed an immense amount of energy without limits. He had never felt so exhilarated before. His mind was secretly amazed at Jiang Nanxuan's method, as he had never seen such a technique before. His ability to absorb energy was at least ten times stronger than before.

On the other hand, Duan Xingchen emerged from the bamboo grove after seven days and was completely restored. His youthful face returned, and he thanked Jiang Nanxuan before giving the wooden house a deep glance. Then he turned and left.

Cold Qiuchan looked at Duan Xingchen with a sense of apology. She knew Duan Xingchen loved her genuinely, but her heart was not with him. Her gaze then turned worriedly toward the wooden house where Luo Tian was.

"Little girl, is that your heart's desire inside? Now he's famous throughout Yuling Sect! All the elders and disciples are looking for him. I believe they'll find this place within two days!" Meng Yao smiled lightly.

"Where is that?" Cold Qiuchan's face blushed slightly under her veil, but she couldn't help thinking of the woman standing beside Luo Tian on the Wind and Thunder Platform. Her heart felt a bit disappointed.

Cold Qiuchan didn't know what feelings she had toward Luo Tian. She just felt happy and relaxed when with him. Previously, she thought it was friendship.

But when she heard her father publicly announce that he would betroth her to Luo Tian, she felt no aversion. Instead, there was a hint of anticipation in her heart. Unlike other men, she didn't even bother to look at them.

"What's wrong?" Meng Yao noticed Cold Qiuchan was lost in thought and asked.

"Nothing, nothing... By the way, Meng Yao, when are you and Jiang Nanxuan getting married? I'm waiting for the wedding banquet!" Cold Qiuchan, rare to show her childish side in front of others, pulled Meng Yao's hands and asked.

Hearing Cold Qiuchan's words, Meng Yao's ethereal aura remained unchanged, but her face showed a bitter smile.

Cold Qiuchan realized she had said the wrong thing upon seeing Meng Yao's expression and felt apologetic. Before she could speak, a green python coiled around their feet.

"Hiss... hiss..." The red tongue of the green snake flicked out, making strange sounds.

Meng Yao and Cold Qiuchan's eyes narrowed slightly. Cold Qiuchan's gaze flashed with coldness, and her voice came out from under the black veil: "They're here?"

Three miles away in the bamboo grove, over a hundred Yuling Sect disciples marched toward the small bamboo courtyard. The leader was those dozens of elders' descendants.

"Meng Yao, you don't need to fight. I want to see who dares to step into this bamboo grove!" Cold Qiuchan sneered and released a cold aura, appearing at the edge of the bamboo grove.

Meng Yao smiled slightly and walked out of the bamboo grove like an ordinary person, standing in front of Cold Qiuchan.

As Cold Qiuchan stepped outside the bamboo grove, she saw over a hundred figures approaching. Her gaze was cautious.

"Qiuchan sister, it's been a while!" A white-clothed youth smiled and approached the front of the group, greeting Cold Qiuchan.

"Dongbo Yongsi? Fang Junming, Chen Yuhe..." Cold Qiuchan recited each name, and with every name she spoke, her gaze grew colder.

"What are you doing here?" Cold Qiuchan coldly asked, her black qi swirling and her sword drawn. Her gaze was icy as she looked at the over a hundred people.

"Qiuchan sister, we heard our Young Master is here with Jiang Xiong. We just want to see his appearance! I believe our Young Master would grant us this favor. These people are the elite of Yuling Sect's younger generation. Only our Young Master could have this favor!" The white-clothed youth, Dongbo Yongsi, saw Cold Qiuchan and his eyes lit up. He spoke calmly.

"He's in seclusion! He doesn't have time to see you!" Cold Qiuchan spoke slowly, scanning each person's face and memorizing their appearances to deal with them later.

"Qiuchan sister, is he afraid to come out and see us?" Fang Junming, standing beside Dongbo Yongsi, smiled coldly. His voice was like a rolling thunderstorm that rushed into the bamboo grove.

Meng Yao's face remained calm, and she lightly waved her white jade hand behind her. The bamboo grove gently swayed, making a rustling sound.

Strangely, Fang Junming's voice abruptly stopped and disappeared into the bamboo grove.

Seeing this situation, over a hundred people's faces showed some fear. They had long heard that although Jiang Nanxuan had no cultivation, his expertise in arrays and seals was even superior to the sect's master.

"Qiuchan sister, you should call out this Young Master. We just want to see him and then leave! Otherwise, although this is Jiang Xiong's territory, you two women can't stop us!" Someone in the crowd shouted.

"I said he's in seclusion and isn't available. Once he finishes his seclusion, I'll have them visit you one by one!" Cold Qiuchan coldly replied.

"In seclusion, does that mean he's afraid to see us? I don't think this Young Master is anything special. He's just hiding behind women! And Jiang Nanxuan too, pretending to be mysterious. We came here but he didn't even show up. Instead, two women came out. What a cowardly thing!" Someone in the crowd shouted.

"Poof..." Before that disciple finished speaking, a green light flashed and a bamboo leaf turned into a green beam of light, slicing across his face.

"If you talk too much, it won't just be a scratch on your face!" Meng Yao's calm face remained as she held a bamboo leaf between her two fingers, speaking lightly.

"Hiss..." The people gasped in fear and looked at Meng Yao, who radiated an ethereal aura.

"Meng Shixiong, I'm sorry!" The disciple with a wounded face suddenly remembered Meng Yao's terrifying legend and quickly apologized.

"I don't want to argue with you. If you dare to step into this bamboo grove, I won't be polite!" Meng Yao's white robe fluttered as she pulled Cold Qiuchan and slowly disappeared into the bamboo grove, leaving the people stunned.

"What to do?" They looked at each other and finally turned their gaze toward the three young men in front.

Feeling the others' gazes, the three young men inwardly cursed: "We don't know either!"

Chapter 375: Transmutation

The three men, Dongbo Yongsi and the others, looked grim. They stood there for a moment before biting their lips: "Wait. After seven days, we'll go in. I don't believe over a hundred people can't handle two women!"

Hearing Dongbo Yongsi's decision, the others had no choice but to comply, hoping not to provoke Meng Yao.

Thus, over a hundred people stood outside the bamboo grove waiting for Luo Tian to emerge from seclusion.

"This kid has become a public enemy," Meng Yao and Cold Qiuchan walked back into the bamboo grove, and Meng Yao spoke lightly.

"He's always like this. There's nothing to do but be outstanding and provoke jealousy," Cold Qiuchan's face showed a touch of pride.

"Stop being so proud! Those three aren't easy to deal with!" Meng Yao smiled and sat at the stone table.

"Don't worry, these trash can't beat him," Meng Yao said with a smile. "Meng Yao, you just now used your power. Is your body okay?" Cold Qiuchan asked with concern.

Meng Yao was only two years older than Cold Qiuchan, and they had grown up together. Cold Qiuchan didn't want anything to happen to Meng Yao.

"I'm fine, it's not like I actually fought. Don't worry, I still want to live a few more days!" Meng Yao looked at the wooden house with a hint of longing.

Meanwhile, in the wooden house, the three people—Zheng Xin had stopped her chatter and looked at Luo Tian with a serious expression.

At this moment, Luo Tian seemed to have gained some weight, and sweat dripped from his forehead. His body was wrapped in black symbols.

Jiang Nanxuan stood in front of Luo Tian, ready to act at any moment and cover the Dragon Emperor's reverse scale over the Nirvana Dragon Seal.

"I'll press it!" Luo Tian roared, and the energy he had absorbed over these two days continuously converged and flowed toward the Nirvana Dragon Seal on his wrist.

"One hour... two hours..."

Time passed slowly, and Luo Tian's body gradually became thinner. His energy in the meridians was more solid, having been compressed to its limit.

"Almost there!" Luo Tian mentally calculated, sensing that the compressed energy had reached the edge of the Nirvana Dragon Seal. His face showed a fierce expression.

"This is the moment of success! Break it!" Luo Tian roared, and the energy rushed like a storm against the Nirvana Dragon Seal.

A thunderous sound echoed in Luo Tian's body, and he trembled violently. His hands emitted a series of cracking sounds as he knew his bones had broken from the immense energy impact.

But now was not the time to think about other things. Luo Tian's mind focused entirely on the Nirvana Dragon Seal.

"Crack..." Fine cracks appeared on the Nirvana Dragon Seal, causing Luo Tian's heart to rejoice.

Jiang Nanxuan's face also showed a hint of joy, but it quickly turned to disappointment.

Although the Nirvana Dragon Seal on Luo Tian's wrist was filled with cracks, it still had a long way to go before being completely destroyed.

At this moment, Luo Tian was wrapped in black symbols, and his face looked grim. However, since he was wrapped in the black symbols, Jiang Nanxuan and Zheng Xin couldn't see it.

"Luo Tian, this is your only chance. Try your best! If you fail this time, you'll have to wait three months before using the acupuncture method again!" Jiang Nanxuan's voice carried a strange power that echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Three months!" Luo Tian whispered to himself, not even wanting to wait three days. He had been suppressed by the Nirvana Dragon Seal for so long and was truly tired of it.

"Take a risk!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness, and he waved his hand covered in symbols. A fierce killing aura immediately spread throughout the wooden house.

"Stomp... stomp..." Jiang Nanxuan took a few steps back, his body lifted by this massive killing aura.

Zheng Xin was quick to act and caught Jiang Nanxuan with a whirlwind-like movement. Her face showed a serious expression.

"What is that thing Luo Tian holds? The killing aura is so dense it's terrifying!" Zheng Xin carried Jiang Nanxuan out of the wooden house, her face showing disbelief as she looked at the wooden house emitting continuous killing auras.

"If I'm not mistaken, it's the Killing Pearl. I never expected Luo Tian to have such a terrifying item!" Jiang Nanxuan's calm face also showed a trace of amazement.

"Killing Pearl!" Zheng Xin, as the third prince of the Wind Speed Valley, naturally knew what a Killing Pearl was. Her face showed concern.

"Protect me! If Luo Tian can absorb this Killing Pearl, then his seal should be broken. After that, we'll need the reverse scale."

"I'll do it. Your body has no energy; entering and being eroded by the killing aura would be too dangerous!" Zheng Xin's eyes showed concern as she advised.

"No problem, just protect me," Jiang Nanxuan remained calm.

Seeing Jiang Nanxuan's stubborn expression, Zheng Xin nodded seriously and unleashed her cultivation of bone-formation intermediate stage. A pale green energy spread out, protecting both herself and Jiang Nanxuan as they slowly walked into the wooden house.

"Roar..." At this moment, Luo Tian's eyes were blood-red and his face was twisted. Although he had previously fused with a Killing Pearl, he thought it would be easy.

But Luo Tian realized he was wrong and had made a serious mistake. Although his current strength was strong, the Killing Pearl just fused had attracted the hidden killing aura within him for over two years. The two kinds of killing intent merged and attacked Luo Tian's mind.

"Damn it, I don't believe I can't defeat you today! I defeated you once, I can do it again!" Luo Tian's Five Elements Transcendent Cultivation method surged into action, refining the killing aura. A fierce energy again gathered in Luo Tian's meridians.

When Jiang Nanxuan and Zheng Xin entered, they saw Luo Tian with blood-red eyes and a twisted face. They were concerned because they could clearly feel that Luo Tian's current state was very bad.

"Luo Tian, use the Greenwood Emperor's Scripture!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke again, his voice echoing in Luo Tian's mind.

"Greenwood Emperor's Scripture?" Luo Tian's remaining sanity suddenly awoke. After Jiang Nanxuan reminded him, he suddenly remembered the Greenwood Emperor's Scripture he had感悟 in the stone tablet.

"Yes! The emperor's aura produced by the Greenwood Emperor's Scripture is exactly the enemy of this killing aura!" Luo Tian stopped his Five Elements Transcendent Cultivation method and green energy surged from his body, emitting a faint vitality that seemed to weaken the killing aura in the wooden house.

Chapter 376: Seal Broken

Yuling Sect, Jiang Nanxuan's residence.

A week passed again. After refining the killing aura with the Greenwood Emperor's Scripture, Luo Tian's killing aura finally calmed down. His entire body radiated a new vitality.

On the other hand, outside the bamboo grove, Dongbo Yongsi and others finally grew impatient. They decided to enter the bamboo grove and drag out that Young Master.

"Let's go. He keeps avoiding us, we can't wait for him forever!" Fang Junming spoke with determination.

"Let's go!"

"Does he need to seclude for a year? We have to wait a year?" People also became impatient. Although Meng Yao's strength was terrifying, they were over a hundred people—this was the elite of Yuling Sect's younger generation. If they fought, they truly didn't believe Meng Yao could knock them all down.

They muttered and walked into the bamboo grove, but as they stepped in, all the green bamboos suddenly began to sway and rustle.

"Retreat..." The hundred people felt the bamboo grove's complexity and immediately retreated from it.

But as they withdrew, the bamboo grove didn't stop swaying. Instead, it became more intense, as if a happy child was welcoming its parents.

"Greenwood Emperor's Scripture!" The bamboo grove's depths, Cold Qiuchan and Meng Yao showed a touch of surprise. They could clearly feel the intense vitality radiating from the wooden house where Luo Tian and the others were.

"I never expected Luo Tian to have more of the Greenwood Emperor's Scripture than me!" Cold Qiuchan's lips curled.

"His talent, in every aspect, is unmatched by anyone of his age!" Meng Yao lightly sipped tea and spoke calmly.

In the wooden house, Luo Tian's face under the black symbols showed a hint of joy. After seven days of refinement, he had finally completed refining his last Killing Pearl into his cultivation. Although this cultivation was still not yet his.

"This time, I'll see if you can break!" Luo Tian's lips slightly curled as he roared and again slammed his massive energy against the Nirvana Dragon Seal.

"Crack..." A clear sound echoed on Luo Tian's wrist, but it wasn't the sound of broken fingers. It was the true sound of the Nirvana Dragon Seal breaking.

"Success!" Zheng Xin and Jiang Nanxuan's faces showed great joy as they looked at Luo Tian's wrist.

Golden light slowly flowed from the Nirvana Dragon Seal, illuminating the entire wooden house and shooting into the sky.

"Ah..." A lazy yawn echoed in their ears, a child appearing within the golden light. His face showed confusion.

"Dragon Baby!" Luo Tian whispered, his face showing a hint of joy as he looked at the dragon baby in the sky.

"Big brother? How could I come out?" The dragon baby seemed to not recognize the man with black symbols on his body. He sniffed his nose and then asked in confusion.

"Go wait a little while, after that, big brother will let you not sleep anymore!" Luo Tian's face showed excitement as he called out to the dragon baby.

"Okay!" The dragon baby's face also showed excitement. To him, not sleeping meant he could play outside.

The golden light fell, and the dragon baby wearing a diaper stood on the corner of the wall.

"Luo Tian, you can relax now. The rest is up to me!" Jiang Nanxuan smiled and stepped forward, holding the Dragon Emperor's reverse scale in his hand.

"Thank you!" Luo Tian showed a touch of gratitude, feeling clearly that the Nirvana Dragon Seal was slowly healing itself. If it healed successfully, all his previous efforts would be wasted.

Jiang Nanxuan said nothing and gently placed the Dragon Emperor's reverse scale on Luo Tian's wrist. He touched his finger, letting a drop of blood fall onto the dragon scale and then continuously carved on it.

As Jiang Nanxuan continued carving, the black symbols on Luo Tian's body moved like snakes, slowly gathering and shrinking toward the seal on his wrist.

Jiang Nanxuan only carved for a moment, and sweat appeared on his forehead. His entire body trembled slightly, showing that the carving was difficult for him to bear.

"Ugh..." After another moment, Jiang Nanxuan sighed in relief and showed a happy expression.

"I've finished!" As Jiang Nanxuan's words fell, the black symbols on Luo Tian's body finally shrank to the size of tadpoles. They slowly gathered into the Nirvana Dragon Seal, covering it with the Dragon Emperor's reverse scale.

"Seal..." Jiang Nanxuan whispered lowly.

"Buzz..." A powerful energy fluctuation spread from the wooden house, directly blowing off its roof.

After the fluctuation passed, Luo Tian's face showed a strong joy. His aura suddenly surged and his cultivation sprang out like a flood.

"Bone-formation initial stage... bone-formation intermediate stage..." In an instant, Luo Tian's cultivation returned to the bone-formation intermediate stage.

He clenched his fist and smiled: "Finally, I don't have to stay in the body-transformation stage anymore. Bone-formation intermediate stage? Not enough, I've been busy for half a year!"

He whispered to himself and signaled Zheng Xin and Jiang Nanxuan to take the dragon baby away. He wanted to push for another breakthrough.

Zheng Xin supported Jiang Nanxuan, who was somewhat exhausted, and took the dragon baby. Her gaze showed a touch of anticipation as she looked at Luo Tian before leaving the door.

Watching the three leave, Luo Tian's lips slightly curled: "I want to see what level I can reach after six months of sealing and absorbing the Killing Pearl, plus seven days of intense energy absorption!"

Luo Tian sat cross-legged on the ground. As soon as he sat down, his body emitted a clear sound—this was a sign of an upgrade.

In the bamboo grove courtyard, Cold Qiuchan and Meng Yao showed worried expressions. At the moment the roof was blown off, Cold Qiuchan even felt an urge to rush into the wooden house but was forcibly pulled back by Meng Yao.
