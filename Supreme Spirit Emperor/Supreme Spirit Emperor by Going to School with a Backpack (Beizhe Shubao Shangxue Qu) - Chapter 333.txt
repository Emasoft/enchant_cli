“Some I’ve slain below—now it’s your turn!” Shen Gong Feichi’s lips curled into a smirk as his body flickered, surging toward Tu Le Kang who wielded the Sovereign’s Weapon.

“Die!” Tu Le Kang sneered at the mere Epoch Prime novice daring to challenge him, his contempt evident. Such a wretch could be crushed with one hand—especially now that he held the Blood Clan’s Sacred Treasure, the Crimson Lotus Lamp.

“Quake Kill!” Tu Le Kang’s laughter rang out as he gestured, and the suspended Crimson Lotus Lamp blazed with crimson light. A blood-red lotus erupted from it, hurtling toward Shen Gong Feichi with apocalyptic force.

“Fly!” Luo Tian’s body flickered, and Shen Gong Fu’s face twisted with urgency as he rushed toward Shen Gong Feichi.

“Return to your grave!” Shen Gong Feichi scoffed at the world-ending lotus, his hand slamming into empty air.

“Buzz…” A heart-stopping spectacle unfolded—those apocalyptic lotuses reversed course, turning to crush Tu Le Kang himself.

“What?” Tu Le Kang’s eyes widened in disbelief as the lotus image loomed larger, its quaking force colliding with his body.

“Crack…” A sharp sound echoed as Tu Le Kang, a prime Epoch powerhouse, was crushed by the Sovereign’s Weapon.

“Who is your true master?” Shen Gong Feichi’s face contorted with a savage grin, his gaze fixed on the supreme Red Lotus Ancient Lamp hovering in the starry void. He extended his hand to grasp it.

“Buzz…” The ancient lotus lamp hummed, its crimson light pulsing as it descended upon Shen Gong Feichi’s head, showering his body with radiant red light.

“Ah! Feichi has inherited the Blood Lord’s legacy!” Luo Tian’s face lit with realization, his eyes wide as Shen Gong Feichi’s blood surged violently.

“Kill!” As Shen Gong Feichi struck, the battlefield erupted into chaos. Luo Tian’s eyes flashed cold as he lunged at a mid-Epoch powerhouse.

Chapter 1354: Blood Battle Against Mid-Epoch

“Kill! Escape and be free—fail, and your bones shall rot in the stars!” Xuan Bing Shou knew flight was futile; only a desperate fight remained.

“Kid, even if the Crimson Lotus Lamp is yours, what good is it? You’re still Epoch Prime—no match for me!” Tu Le Kang sneered, his eyes dark with malice as he lunged at Shen Gong Feichi.

“Everyone must die!” Shen Gong Feichi brandished the Crimson Lotus Lamp, his eyes burning with bloodlust as he charged.

“Xuan Bing, it’s been too long—let me test your skills!” Qi Hongyun’s body crackled with black energy as he locked eyes with Xuan Bing Old Ancestor, charging him.

“Sky-Devouring Fan!” Hun Xuefeng’s face twisted with cruelty. Though the Qilin Bell had subdued the heavens, the Crimson Lotus Lamp’s theft by a human child was infuriating—yet his Sky-Devouring Fan alone sufficed.

Hun Xuefeng’s confidence was unshakable; with the Sky-Devouring Fan, he could slaughter these foes like butchering chickens.

“Spatial Warship!” As Hun Xuefeng activated his fan, the Seven Star Island’s forces erupted with madness. Nearly ten million warriors surged into the spatial warship, their combined power triggering a metamorphosis. The colossal ship roared toward Hun Xuefeng.

“Damn it!” Hun Xuefeng felt the ship’s might, matching his Sky-Devouring Fan. He had no choice but to unleash it against the warship.

The clash of titans thundered, shaking the heavens as the spatial warship collided with the fan.

“Without a Sovereign’s Weapon, what good is it? I’m Epoch Late—utterly crushing you all!” Hun Xuefeng’s face darkened as he dodged Luo Tian’s attack.

“Elders, hold his assault—leave the rest to us!” Guan Xingjian brandished his seven-foot green wind sword, charging a mid-Epoch foe.

“Kill! I’ll see if mid-Epoch can withstand me!” Yang Jinghua and Hu Tianzong seized a mid-Epoch target, charging forward.

“Seven Star Sword Array!” The Seven Star Island’s lords’ faces were frenzied as seven swords ignited, forming a lethal array to trap six early-Epoch clan warriors.

“Kid, last time you escaped—this time no one will save you!” Luo Tian’s target, a mid-Epoch warrior, sneered. Though Luo Tian pressured him, he doubted the human’s strength.

“Last time you three fought—this time no luck!” Luo Tian’s face hardened, abandoning curses. If he failed, human forces would collapse.

“Remember—my name is Hun Qiu. All humans shall die… you’ll just die later!” The middle-aged man smiled, charging Luo Tian with a gray longsword.

“Fool! You’ve earned your name! Why not call yourself an idiot!” Luo Tian activated his demonic state, his power peaking. A black demon sword materialized in his grip, and the first of Seven Demon Blades slashed downward.

“Crack…” The two swords clashed—Luo Tian’s black blade shattered, leaving him sighing. Mid-Epoch power was indeed formidable.

The endless void thundered as the battlefield teetered between equality. Yet all knew this was just beginning—when either the spatial warship or Guan Xingjian’s forces fell, balance would shatter.

The three clan warriors understood this, each striking with all their might to end opponents swiftly.

“Second strike… seventh strike…” Luo Tian relentlessly slashed, his black demon sword shattering repeatedly.

Hun Qiu, though battered, kept his gray longsword intact and suffered fewer wounds than Luo Tian.

“Mid-Epoch truly outmatches Seven Demon Blades!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, his eyes darkening as he lunged again.

“Kid, die!” Hun Qiu marveled at Luo Tian’s tenacity—most Epoch Prime or prodigies would’ve been crippled by his earlier strikes. Yet Luo Tian merely spat blood, unscathed.

“Bamboo Seven Stomp!” Luo Tian seized the moment, launching his first step of Bamboo Seven.

Bamboo Heaven’s Attack and One Force Shattering Ten Thousand Methods combined with Luo Tian’s monstrous physique made the stomp terrifying. With one word, it was brute force.

“This…” Hun Qiu’s face paled—unaware of Luo Tian’s Bamboo Seven Stomp display in the Star Moon Clan. The colossal black foot stunned him.

“Crack!” Hun Qiu’s momentary distraction allowed the black foot to crush his body, leaving him pale and falling.

“Bamboo God’s Second Stomp—Shatter Stars… Bamboo God’s Fifth Stomp Shakes the World!” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate, launching steps two through five. Each step shattered vast starfields, crushing Hun Qiu.

“Primordial Holy Sword!” Hun Qiu, a mid-Epoch powerhouse, recovered quickly. Though stunned by the first stomp, he deflected the remaining steps.

“Boom… boom… boom…” The thunderous clashes echoed as monstrous feet obliterated before Hun Qiu, violent waves sweeping starfields and shattering stars.

“End his sword!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered, darkening as he launched his fifth step.

“Useless!” Hun Qiu, though unharmed, was pale. The Bamboo Seven Stomp had wounded him severely. He glared at Luo Tian’s descending foot.

As he spoke, Hun Qiu raised his sword to slash downward, gray light cleaving stars.

“Eight Directions of Treasure Retrieval!” Luo Tian roared, his hand snatching at the void. Invisible waves surged into Hun Qiu’s sword.

“Buzz…” The gray blade, about to strike Luo Tian’s foot, reversed and shattered.

“This…” Hun Qiu was stunned again—his powerful attack self-destructed.

“Boom!” Luo Tian’s fifth stomp crushed Hun Qiu’s body, this time solidly.

“Puke…” Hun Qiu’s body cracked, blood spewing as he fell into the void.

“Still alive?” Luo Tian frowned, his demon sword reformed, seventh strike of Seven Demon Blades descending.

Luo Tian’s fifth stomp could’ve crippled a mid-Epoch—had Hun Qiu not possessed a trace of Sovereign blood, he’d have been reborn in blood. Yet it didn’t change the outcome. The black demon sword sliced Hun Qiu in two, blood mist scattering into the void.

“Ah…” Luo Tian howled again, his soul now bearing three gray flames, entwining it. His body trembled from the excruciating pain.

Luo Tian had always endured pain—this added torment made him struggle.

“Kid, how does it feel to bear a curse?” Hun Qiu’s pale face reformed, his awe at Luo Tian’s strength mixed with a snarl. He brandished the gray sword, flying toward Luo Tian.

“Bamboo God’s Fifth Stomp Shakes the World!” Luo Tian’s low, beast-like roar echoed as his black foot descended again, crushing Hun Qiu’s weakened body.

“Boom…” Hun Qiu’s form, just reformed, exploded again under the black foot.

“Primordial Law Seals Demons!” Luo Tian pointed, Primordial Power spreading over the blood mist, beginning to refine it.

“Buzz…” A surge of blue smoke rose—sacred blood, refined by Primordial Power, vanished into the void.

“Roar…” Luo Tian howled, invisible waves forming around him. His gray soul flared with three flames, his soul being refined within them.

“Get out…” Luo Tian’s blood roared skyward, forming a blood-colored dragon that circled his body, countering the terrifying flames.

Chapter 1355: Shifting the Balance

The low roar was agonizing, halting the battlefield. Fighters paused, turning their gaze to Luo Tian.

“What’s wrong with副岛主 Luo? Why the pain?” The spatial warship’s crew looked puzzled at Luo Tian, who howled.

“It’s a curse!” Shi Tianming’s feet probed as he and Yun Wuya fought Hun Xuefeng.

“The mid-Epoch warrior is dead!” People paused, seeing the rising white smoke beneath Luo Tian—Hun Qiu’s form vanished.

“Fast! He killed a mid-Epoch!” People marveled, Luo Tian’s victory boosting the Seven Star Island’s morale.

“Haha! Xuan Bing, don’t be too happy—this kid bears the Curse of the God-Devouring Pill, forged by the Barbarian Clan’s Sa Man. Even if he survives, he won’t live long!” Qi Hongyun sneered as he fought Xuan Bing Old Ancestor, pushing back.

“Hmph!” Xuan Bing Old Ancestor ignored him, cold waves erupting from his hands, each strike leaving Qi Hongyun battered.

“Curse!” Others saw Luo Tian’s agony, their hearts jolted—knowing the Barbarian Clan’s curse was terrifying. Recall Yang Jinghua and Guan Xingjian’s fates.

Luo Tian’s curse was worse than theirs, leaving him helpless.

“Immortal Herb! Why don’t we use Purple Apex Divine Lotus?” The Seven Star Island’s crew murmured.

“Purple Apex Divine Lotus!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed, his hand snatching at the spatial warship. Purple lightning surged, and the lotus appeared in his grip.

“Subdue it!” Luo Tian inhaled, absorbing purple energy into his body.

“Boom…” Purple lightning and boundless vitality flooded Luo Tian’s body, clashing with the gray flames.

With Purple Apex Divine Lotus’ vitality suppressing the three gray flames, they weakened.

Time passed—Purple Apex Divine Lotus’ vitality waned, struggling in Luo Tian’s grip. The gray flames vanished.

“Huff…” Luo Tian sighed, relief in his eyes as his wounds healed. He was back to peak condition.

“No pain—wonderful!” Luo Tian felt lighter, his gaze apologetic toward the lotus.

“Sorry…” He shook his head—using Purple Apex Divine Lotus’ vitality to suppress the gray flames was a one-time act. Its vitality wasn’t infinite; it took an epoch for Primordial Lords to cultivate a complete immortal herb.

Luo Tian waved his hand, storing the lotus, then surveyed the battlefield, deciding whom to aid.

“Suppress!” The battlefield saw Xuan Bing Old Ancestor压制 Qi Hongyun, Shen Gong Feichi’s Sovereign Weapon Red Lotus Lamp clashing evenly with Tu Le Kang. Four elders fought Hun Xuefeng in stalemate. Surprisingly, Guan Xingjian held his own with the Sword Nation.

Only Yang Jinghua and Hu Tianzong struggled, their combined strength temporarily holding back the Blood Clan’s mid-Epoch warrior.

“Hah!” Yang Jinghua unleashed a grand strike, his body battered as he slashed the Blood Clan’s middle-aged man. Hu Tianzong darted, his gray spear striking like a snake.

“Die!” Luo Tian refused to waste time—longer the battle, worse for his side.

He launched Bamboo Seven Stomp again, fifth step thundering toward the Blood Clan’s warrior.

“Crack…” The Blood Clan’s middle-aged man, previously压制 Yang Jinghua and Hu Tianzong, grimaced. He knew Luo Tian’s foot was terrifying—his strength matched Hun Qiu’s. If Luo Tian killed Hun Qiu, he could kill him too.

A massive pressure swept over the Blood Clan’s man, who felt destruction. He wanted to flee but was trapped by Yang and Hu.

“Crack…” The black foot crushed the Blood Clan’s man, blood splattering as his body cracked.

“Leave it to you!” Luo Tian smiled at Yang and Hu, unwilling to bear the curse. His foot hadn’t reborn the Blood Clan’s man but had wounded him severely—Luo Tian trusted their strength to kill a mid-Epoch.

“Got it!” Yang and Hu replied, streaking toward the Blood Clan’s man.

“Next, deal with another!” Luo Tian turned, eyes smiling toward Guan Xingjian’s battle.

“No need for you, Luo Tian—see my ninth strike! Can you withstand it?” Guan Xingjian stood in the Sword Nation, his eyes gleaming. He seemed a sword drawn from its sheath.

“Backed by Dao,锋 by virtue,气 by yin-yang,柄 by stars—cut heaven’s light, slay mortals!” Guan Xingjian’s hands formed seals. A golden sword materialized, its aura terrifying Luo Tian.

“Buzz…” The buzz echoed in Guan Xingjian’s body as the golden sword extracted Epoch power.

Guan Xingjian’s face paled, his body twisting in Luo Tian’s view.

“Xuan Tian Nine Swords—Heaven’s Sword!” Guan Xingjian raised his hands, the golden sword roaring down on the Qilin Clan’s middle-aged man.

“Damn it!” The man grimaced, sensing danger.

“Roar…” Green energy surged, his true form—a four-legged beast—racing away.

“Can’t escape!” Guan Xingjian’s body thinned, his hands summoning green wind swords. A storm formed, trapping the Qilin.

The golden sword struck the beast’s body—green blood spattered, Heaven’s Sword splitting it. The beast deflated into a corpse.

“Strong!” Luo Tian marveled, watching the corpse—no rebirth. He spoke aloud.

“How about that? Can you withstand it?” Guan Xingjian panted, his body pale.

“Can’t.” Luo Tian shook his head, honestly.

Hearing this, the Sword Nation collapsed. Guan Xingjian’s eyes rolled back as he fell.

Luo Tian moved, catching him. He waved his hand, retrieving Guan Xingjian’s sword, then sent him to the spatial warship battling the Qilin Bell.

“Luo Tian!” People cheered, gazing at him with reverence.

Now the human side had an advantage—Luo Tian’s initial kill of Hun Qiu and aiding Yang and Hu to gain the upper hand.

“Die!” Laughter echoed as a sword and spear killed the Blood Clan’s man—three mid-Epoch warriors eliminated.

Human forces cheered, excitement in their eyes. Victory seemed near.

“Annihilate!” Meanwhile, seven star swords roared, unleashing a deadly attack that crushed six early-Epoch warriors in the array.

“Qi Hongyun, see? This is human strength!” Xuan Bing Old Ancestor’s icy palm struck, forcing Qi Hongyun to spit blood.

“Damn it!” Qi Hongyun, Hun Xuefeng, and Tu Le Kang’s faces darkened. Now only three late-Epoch warriors remained.

“No choice—Qi Hongyun, summon the Qilin Bell and destroy them all!” Hun Xuefeng pushed back Yun Wuya, ordering Qi Hongyun. He knew if they continued, all might perish—Xuan Bing Old Ancestor’s strength was superior.

“Fine.” Qi Hongyun had no choice, his cold gaze as he grabbed the black Qilin Bell.

“Die!” He roared, slamming it downward.

Chapter 1356: Last Hope

“Flee!” As Qi Hongyun retrieved the Qilin Bell, Xuan Bing Old Ancestor’s face darkened. He barked at the spatial warship’s crew.

“Flee!” Luo Tian’s face changed instantly, channeling Epoch Power into the ship’s altar.

“Buzz…” The massive warship vanished into the void, disappearing from the stars.

“Boom…” As the ship retreated, a heavy bell sound echoed across the void.

Invisible waves spread, hitting Luo Tian’s minds—his and others’ faces paled.

“Regroup!” Xuan Bing Old Ancestor transformed, rushing into the Seven Star Array to control it against the terror.

No need for Xuan Bing’s command—Luo Tian and others rushed into the array, activating it to resist.

Invisible patterns bloomed, waves spreading—stars turned gray, vacuum forming. Time seemed frozen. Only the bell’s echo remained.

“Damn it!” Xuan Bing and Yun Wuya’s faces showed madness as they activated their Seven Stars.

“Woo…” The swords hummed, sensing danger. They erupted with brilliant light, like stars hovering over Luo Tian’s heads—sword intent everywhere.

Soon, the invisible waves reached the array.

“Boom… boom… boom…” The Seven Star Array held for a moment before breaking—each sword shattered.

“Buzz…” Waves hit Luo Tian’s group, their bodies trembling. Even Xuan Bing Old Ancestor spat blood.

“Sky-Devouring Fan!” Without the spatial warship’s hindrance, Hun Xuefeng controlled his fan. A gray chaos storm, destroying the heavens, surged toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Done!” All, including Luo Tian, saw the apocalyptic storm—despair rose. The previous Qilin Bell attack had been partially blocked by the array, but now—Sovereign Weapons’ attacks would annihilate them.

“Guard!” A blood-red figure appeared before Luo Tian’s group—Shen Gong Feichi, his Red Lotus Ancient Lamp glowing. He activated it fiercely, a blood-red lotus surrounding them.

“Eight Directions of Treasure Retrieval!” Luo Tian grabbed, sending invisible waves to the lotus.

“Buzz…” With Eight Directions of Treasure Retrieval added, the blood-red lotus solidified, shielding them.

Next, the gray storm struck—thunderous sound, shaking Luo Tian’s group pale, their blood churning.

But the Red Lotus Lamp was a Sovereign Weapon—stronger than the Seven Star Array, preventing further injuries.

“Two Sovereign Weapons combined—I’ll see how you block!” Qi Hongyun sneered, exchanging glances with Hun Xuefeng. The bell rang again.

“Boom…”

“Buzz…” The bell rang, a destructive storm rising from the Sky-Devouring Fan. The storm seemed to blow the entire void away, only the bell’s echo remaining.

Worse still, combined attacks were stronger—three times more powerful than individual strikes. Even Epoch Prime could be killed.

“Impossible!”

“Hope the spatial warship has escaped far enough! Regret—human prodigies, only Xing Jian left!” Xuan Bing Old Ancestor’s face bore resentment.

“Let me see what the Nine Realms are like!” Yun Wuya and Bai Ze’s faces were bitter. Two Sovereign Weapons’ combined attack left no escape—despite the Red Lotus Lamp, they were doomed. This was the terror of Sovereign Weapons.

“There’s still hope! I’ll pour all my cultivation into the Red Lotus Lamp—young ones, escape quickly!” Xuan Bing Old Ancestor urgently transmitted to Luo Tian’s group.

“Only one last gamble!” Yun Wuya’s group nodded, determination in their eyes as they looked at Luo Tian, Hu Tianzong, Guan Xingjian, and Shen Gong Feichi.

“Feichi, take care of yourself!” Shen Gong Fu smiled at his bloodied son.

“There’s still a chance!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, madness in his eyes as he spoke.

“What chance?” Their confusion was evident—what plan did Luo Tian have?

“The Epoch Book!” Luo Tian’s face showed madness, his mind surging as he attacked the Epoch Book.

“Come out!” Luo Tian’s long hair flew, his mind roaring as he assaulted the book.

“Buzz…” Golden light radiated from Luo Tian, his aura overwhelming—Xuan Bing Old Ancestor’s group was stunned.

The golden Epoch Book emerged from Luo Tian’s mind, lighting the void—its aura overshadowing even the Red Lotus Lamp.

“What is this?”

“The Epoch Book! A sacred artifact of the Epoch Lords!” Xuan Bing Old Ancestor’s group gasped, eyes wide at the book’s dominance.

“That! The Epoch Book! Damn it—it was ours in ancient times, stolen by the Traitor Lord!” Hun Xuefeng, Qi Hongyun, and Tu Le Kang’s eyes turned blood-red.

The Epoch Book was legendary among ancient clans—every Sovereign had once possessed it. Capturing it would be worth losing a Sovereign Weapon.

“Big brother, give me strength—crush them all!” Luo Tian addressed the book, pouring his Epoch Power into it.

But next moment, he was stunned—his power was nearly drained by the book, yet it emitted no reaction.

“Damn!” Luo Tian cursed under his breath—this big brother was letting him down at a crucial moment.

Xuan Bing Old Ancestor’s group also gaped, watching the floating Epoch Book. Though its aura was overwhelming, it had no effect.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian activated the book, Tu Le Kang and Hun Xuefeng’s Sovereign Weapons attacked the blood-red lotus.

“Cough… cough…” The group spat blood, weakness in their eyes.

But the Red Lotus Lamp endured, its lotus humming with refinement.

Four island lords, at half-Epoch, were obliterated by the attack—vaporized into mist.

Too strong—their aura was beyond half-Epoch’s capacity. The four lords didn’t even react, dying instantly without a chance to rebirth.

“Old Four!” Tong Yangjian’s group looked furious, eyes blood-red at the lords’ deaths.

Luo Tian felt his heart bleeding—remembering when he first arrived at the Seven Star Island, Old Four’s awkwardness inviting him. Old Five’s iron-like kindness to him—now they were dead.

“Asshole!” Luo Tian trembled, cursing. His two Shrouds of Immortality collapsed into Epoch Power, injected into the book.

But the book remained unresponsive, leaving Luo Tian bitter.

“We’ll try too! A last gamble!” Xuan Bing Old Ancestor’s group turned desperate, their Epoch Power surged into the book.

“Open!” Luo Tian roared, his hand sweeping—gray stone tablet, the Wheel of Rebirth from Jie Tian Lord, emerged. It thundered toward the book.

This tablet was equally terrifying.

“Crack…” The gray tablet smashed the book, thunderous sound echoing.

“Buzz…” Next moment, the book seemed pulled—its pages slightly trembled.

“Again!” Luo Tian went mad, repeatedly smashing the tablet into the book.

“One… two…” Each hit made the book stir—until finally, it glowed golden.

“Boom…” The red lotus finally shattered, despair sweeping over Luo Tian’s group.

“Buzz…” As the group despaired, the golden Epoch Book absorbed all their Epoch Power, glowing brilliantly. It seemed awakened, radiating overwhelming aura.

Chapter 1357: Into the Void

Its power swept, overwhelming the three Sovereign Weapons. A pure white light emerged from the book, spreading across the group.

Though gentle, this light contained infinite terror—spreading into the void.

In an instant, the white light met the two Sovereign Weapons’ attacks—eerie buzzing echoed across the stars. The void trembled.

“Shout!” All in the void screamed, blood gushing from their orifices.

The two Sovereign Weapons’ attacks were repelled, vanishing instantly.

Though the white light moved slowly, it reached Tu Le Kang, Hun Xuefeng, and Qi Hongyun in an instant.

“Defend!” Fear surged—seeing the light like sunlight, their eyes widened in terror. They activated their weapons, surrounding themselves with radiant barriers—exhaling relief.

“Buzz…” The buzzing continued—their defenses were sliced apart like tofu by the white light.
