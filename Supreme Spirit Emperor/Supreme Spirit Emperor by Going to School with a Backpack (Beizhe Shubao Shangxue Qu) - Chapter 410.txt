As he spoke, Luo Tian burst out of the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword's domain and charged toward the massive figure. The three-headed dog moved swiftly, but Luo Tian was no slower; before his words had even finished echoing, the two clashed.

"Boom... Boom..." The thunderous sound erupted across the boundless and dark fourth chamber, and almost instantly after Luo Tian leapt forward, Sun Mengru and the others retreated far away with the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword.

Moments later, their mouths formed an "O" shape, eyes wide with disbelief as they watched Luo Tian retreating and the three-headed dog flying backward.

"My god, what kind of monster is this? It can withstand Luo Tian's physical attacks and even repel him!" Their faces bore expressions of astonishment.

At present, Luo Tian's physical body was invincible; no one could match him in combat unless a Grand Epoch Master personally intervened. His physical form had become his greatest weapon, yet they hadn't expected another entity—unrelated to the Grand Epoch Masters—to withstand his might.

"Roar..." The three-headed dog's eyes flared crimson with fury, and it lunged forward again. Its maw opened wide, emitting a powerful suction force from the central head.

"Beast!" Luo Tian let out a cold snort, golden spiritual energy surged upward as he darted forward again toward the three-headed dog.

Chapter 1614: Hell's Three-Headed Dog

The roar echoed in Luo Tian's ears, an invisible wave radiating outward. Their expressions darkened as the black three-headed dog lunged again, its central head devouring Luo Tian.

Infinite suction force gripped Luo Tian's body, pulling him toward the bloodstained maw.

"Get out..." Luo Tian's spiritual energy surged, a towering aura rising from his body like a golden-armored war god. Rather than resisting, he let the violent suction pull him in.

"Buzz..." In an instant, Luo Tian vanished from his spot, his speed seemingly breaking all limits. He appeared before the maw in a flash.

"Want to swallow me? Let's see if your fangs are strong enough!" Luo Tian's face was cold, spiritual energy channeled as he halted beside the three-headed dog's maw. While resisting the violent suction, his golden fist glowed with radiant light and smashed toward the icy fangs.

"Crack..." The thunderous sound echoed as Luo Tian's golden fist struck the fangs.

"Roar..." The three-headed dog let out a pained roar, its massive heads swaying violently.

A wave of putrid stench erupted from the maw, instantly causing Luo Tian to feel dizzy. His face changed abruptly.

"It has poison!" Luo Tian's body flickered, instantly vanishing from beside the three-headed dog's maw and reappearing before Sun Mengru. His face had a green tinge.

"Luo Tian..." Seeing his expression, Diao Dezhu and the others showed concern. They hadn't expected anything to change Luo Tian's color.

Seven-colored flames erupted from Luo Tian's body, instantly dispersing the toxic gas within him.

"Roar..." As Luo Tian purified the poison, the three-headed dog let out another roar. Its three massive heads howled skyward; one head unleashed black lightning, another emitted icy coldness, and the central head was surrounded by green mist, filling the entire chamber.

Three overwhelming attacks devastated everything in their path, instantly enveloping Luo Tian and his companions. Sun Mengru and the others stood under the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, their faces filled with shock as they felt an immense crisis. Even they had to be cautious in facing this threat.

"What the hell is this thing? Dog, do you know what it is?" Black lightning crackled on the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, absorbed by it. Zheng Xin and others spoke, their eyes turning to Diao Dezhu—the only one among them who was a beast.

"I don't know what the hell this thing is! What kind of monster has three heads and strength comparable to a Grand Epoch Master!" Diao Dezhu shouted back, his gaze fixed on the three-headed dog, his voice filled with disbelief.

Luo Tian stood beneath the black lightning, his body radiating ten thousand feet of light while the endless icy coldness continuously eroded him. It seemed to freeze his body, slowing his movements.

"God damn it's cold! No matter what, I have to finish this beast!" Luo Tian shivered, his spiritual energy surging as he stomped the ground with a heavy sound and charged toward the three-headed dog's massive body again.

With thunderous claps, Luo Tian was wrapped in seven-colored flames and appeared before the three-headed dog. At the same time, his Dao Sealing Fist rotated outward, smashing toward the beast.

At that moment, the three-headed dog's massive paws also descended, aiming to crush Luo Tian's tiny form.

"Boom..." The thunderous sound roared as the three-headed dog's massive body flew backward, vanishing into the black night.

"Boom... Boom..." The deafening collision echoed like thunder, clearly indicating that the three-headed dog had collided with something.

Beneath Luo Tian's feet, the road of accumulated bones made a crisp sound as his feet sank deep into the bone-covered ground, shattering vast amounts of bones.

"What in hell is this beast!" Luo Tian's face darkened as he pulled his hands out of the bone pile, his body emitting thick smoke from the black lightning.

Though the collision seemed to have given Luo Tian the upper hand, he knew the three-headed dog was unharmed.

"Ha ha, kid, how's my pet doing?" As Luo Tian pondered, that seductive voice echoed again in his mind, causing his face to change.

"My pet is called the Hell's Three-Headed Dog. It feeds on the bones of this Holy Bone Palace daily, and its physical form has reached peak mastery. Just surrender and die!" The cold voice made Luo Tian shudder.

"Who the hell are you? Do you want to possess me? Why don't you show yourself?" Luo Tian's voice carried a hint of disdain, echoing through the chamber.

Though his words were dismissive, Luo Tian's mind was more alert. Whoever raised such a pet could not be an easy opponent.

"It's not the time yet! I'll deal with you after I've played enough, but rest assured—everything about you is mine!" The seductive voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, causing a wave of irritation.

"Treacherous coward! I'll see how you possess me!" Luo Tian let out a cold snort, his body flickering as he rushed toward the three-headed dog emerging from the darkness.

"Manifesting the Dao!" As he ran, Luo Tian's hands formed a seal, his body radiating divine light. His figure began to expand rapidly.

"Ten zhang... Hundred zhang..." In an instant, Luo Tian's body had grown to a hundred zhang in height, his aura overwhelming.

Though Luo Tian could normally expand to a thousand zhang, this chamber had a special suppressing force that limited his growth.

"We should go help him and finish off this beast!" Sun Mengru spoke coldly, her golden divine sword in hand as she stepped out from under the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword.

"Right! I'm starving, I love grilled chicken wings and dog meat hotpot!" Chen Zhanbiao also stepped forward with a thunderous sound, his body rapidly growing to a hundred zhang. His muscles were like iron-forged steel as he stomped down toward the black three-headed dog.

Others also launched their attacks, and brilliant martial arts lit up the darkness, each strike crashing toward the three-headed dog.

"Sealing the Heaven's Seal!" Luo Tian channeled his power, a golden seal rising from the darkness with overwhelming aura, smashing toward the three-headed dog.

"Roar..." The three-headed dog shuddered as it saw Luo Tian's martial arts. It let out a furious roar, and the violent suction force returned from its three bloodstained mouths.

"Buzz..." The humming sound reverberated, and the immense suction twisted space itself, creating a powerful storm. White bones were sucked into the three-headed dog's maw.

At the same time, this immense suction force struck Luo Tian and his companions' martial arts. Their faces were filled with shock as they watched their powerful attacks—enough to make even Grand Epoch Masters cautious—dissipate instantly, merging into a terrifying vortex that the three heads swallowed.

"My god, what kind of monster is this? It can even eat that..." Diao Dezhu's body trembled as he watched the vortex of martial arts being swallowed by the three-headed dog, his voice filled with disbelief.

"This is really troublesome!" Luo Tian's lips twitched as he hadn't expected the three-headed dog to be so tenacious, possessing such an ability. After all, their combined attack would have killed even a Grand Epoch Master.

But before Luo Tian and his companions could recover from their shock, the three-headed dog's stomach emitted a series of thunderous sounds as if preparing something terrifying. Its crimson eyes stared at Luo Tian and his companions.

"Buzz..." The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword hovered above their heads again, while Luo Tian's gaze was cautious toward the three-headed dog.

As the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword formed a barrier, the three-headed dog let out another roar. Its three heads faced Luo Tian and his companions as three waves of destruction erupted from its mouths, devastatingly pushing toward them.

The three-colored light intertwined and merged into a gray dragon that instantly reached Luo Tian's group, its aura suffocating.

"Boom... Boom..." In an instant, the gray dragon collided with the thunderous barrier, and the dual-colored lightning barrier cracked under the immense impact. Luo Tian's group stood within the barrier, their spiritual energy shaking.

"This is terrifying! If it weren't for this barrier, I feel like I'd be reduced to nothing..."

"His attack has transformed our martial arts!" Sun Kemin's celestial eye cracked open, his voice addressing Luo Tian and the others.

"How is that possible? How can there be such a monster in this world!" Hearing Sun Kemin's words, Luo Tian and his companions' hearts clenched, their breaths catching.

Chapter 1615: The Possession Begins

"What do we do? Our martial arts are useless, and his physical form is变态. Even Luo Tian can't harm these three heads!" Their minds were heavy as they stood under the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword.

"I don't believe he can eat everything!" Luo Tian's face was grim as the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword suddenly expanded, landing in his massive body. He took a step forward and instantly appeared before the three-headed dog.

"Let me see if you can swallow this sword!" Luo Tian roared, then swung the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword toward the Hell's Three-Headed Dog.

"Buzz..." The Wheel of Reincarnation in Luo Tian's dantian hummed, and he poured his Grand Epoch power into the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword.

"Crack..." Golden and blue divine lightning intertwined within the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, a brilliant light instantly illuminating the endless darkness. For a moment, Diao Dezhu and others saw the entire chamber's scene.

The divine power was overwhelming, and the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword was fully activated, its aura capable of annihilating any Grand Epoch peak. Luo Tian held the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword as if he were a true immortal controlling lightning.

In an instant, the expanded sword struck the three-headed dog's body.

A piercing scream echoed through the chamber as black blood gushed from the three-headed dog's neck. At the same time, the head emitting coldness fell off.

The massive black body convulsed continuously, clearly having suffered a fundamental injury. Its aura had also weakened significantly.

"Endless Sword!" Luo Tian panted, his cold voice echoing through the chamber.

The second strike was again activated by Luo Tian, and lightning energy surged from the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword. The overwhelming power swept across, striking the three-headed dog that was now weakened.

"Roar..." The two remaining heads of the three-headed dog roared skyward, fully inciting its ferocity. Its body was drenched in black blood as it stared at the powerful lightning energy, rushing toward Luo Tian.

But the sword technique activated by Luo Tian was terrifying; even a Grand Epoch Master would be bloodied under this strike.

The lightning energy instantly struck the head spewing black lightning, and without any surprise, the second head fell off as if cutting tofu.

At the same time, the massive body instantly appeared before Luo Tian's front, and the remaining head bit down on Luo Tian's body.

"Crack..." Though Luo Tian's physical form was strong, under the three-headed dog's desperate attack, it still managed to bite through. The coldness from the silver fangs entered Luo Tian's body, and at the same time, a large amount of the previous dizziness-inducing poison entered his body.

"Boom..." Seven-colored flames surged within Luo Tian's body, countering the green poison. At the same time, Luo Tian punched the three-headed dog's body.

"Boom..." A heavy sound echoed as the three-headed dog's massive body flew backward, but this time, the remaining head took a large amount of Luo Tian's flesh.

"Snort..." Luo Tian couldn't help but inhale sharply, the pain making him even more dizzy. The white bones exuded a powerful divine law around Luo Tian's body.

The three-headed dog was no better off, having lost two heads and suffering a fundamental injury. It had also been struck by Luo Tian's full power punch, lying on the ground and convulsing violently. Its bloodshot eyes showed signs of weakness.

"Again!" Luo Tian growled, having used the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword twice and feeling some exhaustion. However, he could still activate it once more.

"Let us help you wield it!" Before Luo Tian could lift the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, Sun Mengru's voice echoed in his ears.

"Good!" Luo Tian nodded. His current state was indeed poor, and the flesh torn off by the three-headed dog hadn't recovered yet. It was quite troublesome.

As they spoke, Luo Tian retreated behind his companions and handed the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword to Sun Mengru. He then sat cross-legged on the bone-covered ground, beginning his recovery.

The three-headed dog, having lost two heads, swayed unsteadily and stood up. Its bloodshot eyes looked at the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword hovering above Sun Mengru's group, continuously drawing their Grand Epoch power. Its eyes showed fear.

However, the item wrapped around its neck like a collar emitted radiant light, causing the three-headed dog to become frenzied again. The two heads it had lost began to regrow slowly.

"We can't let him recover; if he does, we'll have to expend a lot of effort!" Sun Kemin's eyes were serious as he shouted at Sun Mengru and the others.

"Crack..." Thunder crackled, and upon hearing Sun Kemin's words, Sun Mengru and the others immediately began to fully activate the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword. The blue sword body expanded again, smashing toward the three-headed dog's massive body.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian watched the expanding Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword and let out a long breath. At this moment, the three-headed dog had been severely wounded. With Sun Mengru's group and the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, they should be able to eliminate this three-headed dog.

"Kid, now that you're without the sword's protection, it's time to finish you off!" As Luo Tian prepared to fully recover, that seductive voice echoed in his mind.

At the same time, the mark on Luo Tian's neck began to flicker again, strange symbols spreading out from it. The symbols slowly transformed into incomprehensible runes, spreading across Luo Tian's body and entering his body.

"Is it coming?" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness as he muttered to himself. He knew the opponent wanted to possess him while he was weak, which would increase his chances of success.

However, even though Luo Tian was currently weakened and in poor condition, he still had his confidence. Possession relied on a battle of spiritual souls; his spiritual soul was far stronger than others, and in front of himself, its strength was also suppressed. A spiritual soul at the same level would be a worm in front of him.

"Buzz..." A series of humming sounds echoed within Luo Tian's body, and a set of golden runes condensed into a golden shadow. The shadow immediately began to seize Luo Tian's entire body, attempting to take control of his physical form. A wave of rejection force filled Luo Tian's entire body.

"I'll see what you're capable of!" Luo Tian muttered coldly, and a gray spiritual soul appeared within his body.

"Unexpectedly, your spiritual soul is so strong!" After Luo Tian's spiritual soul condensed into his body, that seductive voice echoed in his mind.

"Finally revealing your true form, huh!" Luo Tian's gray eyes showed a look of mockery as he gazed at the golden spiritual soul-like entity before him.

"How strong!" Though Luo Tian's words carried mockery, his mind was in turmoil.

The entity before him had an aura that made Luo Tian feel oppressed. If he weren't a Soul-Subduing Master, he would have been crushed by this spiritual soul and unable to resist.

Luo Tian knew it was the aura of a仙 (immortal), different from the Nine Domains. However, this immortal's aura was slightly weak. Though it was supreme, Luo Tian was confident that if he fought desperately, the opponent wouldn't gain any advantage.

"In front of me, you still maintain this state—good work!" The immortal didn't care about Luo Tian's words, his voice calm.

"If I consume you, I'll become a complete human. Then who in this world would be my opponent!" The immortal's voice was filled with excitement as he rushed toward Luo Tian.

"If I consume you, my spiritual soul would also become extraordinary!" Luo Tian muttered to himself. Though there was a great danger, it also contained a significant opportunity.

"Seal the Soul!" Luo Tian's gray fingers pointed, and an invisible wave instantly enveloped the immortal rushing toward him.

"Kid, you know a lot, but your methods are sufficient to deal with the spiritual souls of this world. However, they're not enough for me!" The immortal's thoughts entered Luo Tian's mind as the entity rushed toward him. It was only slightly restrained by Luo Tian's method before instantly breaking free, forming a golden mouth to swallow Luo Tian.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly but didn't dare to be careless against the immortal. His gray spiritual soul swung a punch, combining the梵天攻杀 (Bodhi Heaven's Attack) and 一力破万法 (One Force to Break All Methods), striking the golden mouth.

"Boom..." The gray fist instantly struck the golden mouth, and the immortal's body trembled. It then bit down on Luo Tian's spiritual soul, tearing off one of his shoulders.

"What a beautiful feeling!" The seductive voice echoed as the immortal absorbed Luo Tian's spiritual soul power, gradually forming into a golden figure that appeared before Luo Tian. However, its face was unclear.

"This is the feeling of a human's spiritual soul! Not bad, kid. Don't resist; let me consume you. Let me also experience what it's like to be a human. Your partner is quite good; I have a dual-cultivation technique in my memory. If it's perfected, I guarantee she'll be overwhelmed with ecstasy!" The golden figure immortal took a step forward and rushed toward Luo Tian again.

"Die!" Luo Tian's heart filled with coldness, but the loss of spiritual soul power wasn't significant to him.

Chapter 1616: Finished

In the fourth chamber of the Holy Bone Palace, Sun Mengru and Diao Dezhu continuously attacked the three-headed dog. Meanwhile, Luo Tian, seemingly calm and recovering his injuries and cultivation, was also engaged in a difficult battle.

"Boom..." Thunderous sounds kept echoing within Luo Tian's body as two spiritual souls—gold and gray—collided, vying for control of Luo Tian's body. They continuously devoured each other.

Luo Tian himself was the owner of this physical form, obviously holding an advantage. However, the immortal was incredibly powerful, connected to true immortals. It was likely a residual consciousness of that true immortal, growing into a powerful entity within the Holy Bone Forest.

Luo Tian and the immortal continuously fought, both devouring each other's spiritual soul power. As they devoured more of Luo Tian's spiritual soul, the immortal's appearance gradually became clearer, its facial features resembling Luo Tian's by seven out of ten.

"Sealing the Heaven's Seal..." Luo Tian's gray hands moved, and powerful spiritual soul power condensed into a gray seal. It radiated overwhelming aura as it pressed down toward the immortal.

"Excellent technique, but all of this will belong to me!" The immortal's face, similar to Luo Tian's, showed admiration. It was becoming increasingly excited. If it consumed Luo Tian completely, it would become the true Luo Tian. It wasn't just about possession; it wanted to merge with Luo Tian completely, fully integrating with him.

"Buzz..." A golden seal flew from the immortal's hands, equally powerful and matching Luo Tian's "Sealing the Heaven's Seal," even more potent than his.

"Boom... Boom..." The thunderous sound returned as the two spiritual soul seals collided, making Luo Tian's face turn dark.

"Damn it, I didn't expect that absorbing part of my spiritual soul would also allow it to absorb some of my memories!" Luo Tian muttered, his gray face showing a grim expression. He had been suppressing the immortal for most of their battle, but as time passed, the immortal gradually fought back and even had a turning point.

"Can't continue being devoured by it; I'll have no chance of victory!" Luo Tian muttered, having also devoured a lot of the immortal. However, this immortal only contained some memories, which weren't significant to Luo Tian. Moreover, performing the immortal's techniques wasn't something Luo Tian could do now.

As Luo Tian pondered, the two seals shattered, forming a powerful spiritual soul gust that swept toward both Luo Tian and the immortal.

The immortal watched the sweeping gust, opened its mouth, and began to absorb it. This was spiritual soul power from both Luo Tian and the immortal; absorbing it would enhance itself.

Luo Tian didn't dare to be careless, his body flickering as he rushed toward the gust and competed with the immortal for it.

After both devoured the powerful spiritual soul gust, they rushed toward each other.

"Dao Sealing Fist!" The immortal's voice echoed as runes appeared on its golden arms, striking toward Luo Tian.

"Die!" Luo Tian had no choice but to face it head-on, otherwise he would be in a worse position. With a thunderous sound, Luo Tian also swung a punch, colliding with the immortal again.

Time passed slowly as Luo Tian and the immortal collided repeatedly. The immortal's appearance became increasingly clear, eventually resembling Luo Tian's by nine out of ten. Its techniques were basically the same as Luo Tian's.

As Luo Tian continuously devoured the immortal, his gray spiritual soul gained a golden layer. A strange aura spread from Luo Tian's spiritual soul, and he knew it was the aura of an immortal.

"If I consume this immortal, my spiritual soul will definitely undergo a transformation!" Luo Tian muttered to himself, his eyes glowing with light.

However, as they continued to devour each other, the rejection force of Luo Tian's physical form toward the immortal gradually disappeared. The immortal slowly began to suppress Luo Tian. If he weren't a Soul-Subduing Master, he would have been completely consumed by the immortal.

"Kid, give me your spiritual soul!" The immortal's face bore a sinister expression as it tore off another large chunk of Luo Tian's spiritual soul.

"Dream on! Today I won't let you kill me!" Luo Tian's hands moved, and an invisible wave shot out from his. He discovered a phenomenon: while the immortal could perform other techniques, it had never used the Soul-Subduing Master's methods. And only these methods could harm the immortal significantly.

"Buzz..." Gray soul threads instantly burst from Luo Tian's hands, wrapping around the immortal and attempting to strangle it.

"Damn it..." The immortal cursed inwardly, surprised by Luo Tian's difficulty. It had intended to consume and possess Luo Tian with a crushing force, but it hadn't expected Luo Tian to be so tenacious. He had also devoured a lot of the immortal's spiritual soul power, strengthening himself.

"Get out..." The immortal let out a cold snort, its body glowing with intense light.

"Kid, it's over!" The immortal felt he had enough strength to completely consume Luo Tian. As he spoke, his face turned serious.

"Crack..." The gray soul threads began to break one by one on the immortal's body. At the same time, a powerful aura was gradually being formed within the immortal.

An invisible aura was gathering in the immortal's hands, making Luo Tian's face change wildly.

"Immortal Power!" The next moment, Luo Tian realized what the immortal was gathering—it was about to extract all of its immortal energy and make a final, desperate attack to annihilate him!

Realizing this, Luo Tian didn't dare to be careless. His hands continuously moved, and he evolved the Bodhi Heaven's Attack repeatedly. This was the strongest technique he could think of now. If he couldn't resist it, he might be successfully possessed by the opponent.

"Buzz..." A single opportunity formed in the immortal's hands, more pure than the one that had previously wounded the蛮族准王. Luo Tian's face turned pale, doubting if he could withstand the immortal's attack.

But Luo Tian didn't want to give up. His gray spiritual soul continuously evolved, and powerful spiritual soul energy shot out from his hands. A golden ancient palace gradually formed from his hands, evolving into existence.

Both Luo Tian and the immortal stared at each other's attacks, their hearts filled with intense shock. They both knew this was the final strike—victory meant life, defeat meant death!

"Die!" The immortal roared and unleashed the aura he had gathered. As his immortal energy was extracted, his entire spiritual soul turned gray, and he no longer appeared as powerful as before. He looked like a regular spiritual soul.

"Go..." Luo Tian watched the aura the immortal had pushed out, his heart filled with fear. He felt he couldn't resist it under this aura.

"Boom... Boom..." A golden ancient palace flew from Luo Tian's hands, pressing toward the immortal's aura.

"It's useless! Any technique from the Nine Domains is a chicken and dog under my aura, it can't resist!" The immortal's face showed contempt. Though the ancient palace Luo Tian had evolved made him feel a tremor, he was confident that under his immortal aura, Luo Tian couldn't resist.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian's gray spiritual soul also weakened, his gaze on the evolved ancient palace.

This was the first time Luo Tian had evolved an ancient palace through his spiritual soul, and its power was weaker than one evolved by Grand Epoch energy. Plus, the immortal's aura seemed to fundamentally suppress anything from the Nine Domains. Luo Tian felt that the ancient palace might not withstand this immortal aura.

But he had no other choice, so he prayed it could withstand the attack—it was his strongest technique.

Their attacks instantly rushed toward each other, but Luo Tian's face turned wild. The Eight Directions Falling Treasure Technique was suddenly used as the ancient palace and immortal aura were about to collide. The ancient palace's trajectory changed instantly.

"Since I'm not his match, there's still a chance for mutual destruction!" Luo Tian shouted and controlled the ancient palace to not collide with the immortal aura but instead strike toward the immortal. He also met the immortal's devastating immortal aura head-on.

"Kid, you..." The immortal's face turned pale instantly. Though he was confident his aura could destroy Luo Tian's ancient palace and severely injure him, then consume him, he hadn't expected Luo Tian to pull this move at the crucial moment.

At this point, both the immortal and Luo Tian were weak. If they met head-on with the ancient palace, even if they didn't die, they would be severely injured.

"I might not die, but you'll definitely die!" The immortal's face turned ruthless, his teeth gritted.

"Mutual destruction—though I die, I won't let you harm my friends and family!" Luo Tian's face was filled with madness. Though he knew facing this immortal aura meant certain death, he still didn't give up resisting.

"Buzz..." The soul-shaking aura instantly appeared before Luo Tian's spiritual soul, and before it touched him, his spiritual soul became unstable. It instinctively trembled under this aura.

"This is really over!" Luo Tian's heart was bitter, his body filled with gray energy as he created a barrier to resist this terrifying aura.

Chapter 1617: The Opportunity to Become an Immortal

Immortal power was overwhelming, making anyone or anything seem insignificant before it. Though Luo Tian struggled to resist, he still appeared tiny under this aura.

"Who can withstand this!" Luo Tian muttered lowly, watching the aura approaching him.

"Ah... kid, see who dies!" On the other side, the immortal kept shouting, his voice filled with madness. He felt considerable pressure from Luo Tian's evolved ancient palace.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian felt he could barely hold on, a humming sound arose from his dantian. Golden light burst forth from his dantian, instantly enveloping his entire body.

The powerful light transformed into a pure divine beam, instantly appearing before Luo Tian's spiritual soul and colliding with the aura about to touch his barrier.

"Boom..." A heavy sound echoed within Luo Tian's body, and he wore a look of great joy. His gaze turned to the golden divine beam, almost crying.

"Uncle, you finally responded!" Luo Tian longed to shout into the sky but couldn't due to his spiritual soul state.

Externally, Diao Dezhu and others wore expressions of joy, taking deep breaths as they watched the three-headed dog with its last head severed and lying on the ground.

They had fought the three-headed dog for a quarter of an hour, finally cutting off its third head. At this moment, the three-headed dog had no life left and lay there.

"Ha ha, now I can have dog meat hotpot!" Chen Zhanbiao wiped his forehead, drooling as he rushed toward the bleeding three-headed dog's body. He took out the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword and instantly sliced it.

Large pieces of bloodied flesh fell from the sword, making Diao Dezhu and others' mouths twitch as they watched Chen Zhanbiao skillfully take out a large pot, lighting a fire. He cut the flesh into pieces and threw them into the pot while adding various seasonings from somewhere.

"Using a divine artifact to cut meat—only Zhanbiao and Luo Tian could do this!" Diao Dezhu's face twitched as he muttered.

"This is a glutton, carrying these things everywhere! But it really smells good!" Sun Kemin and others smiled as they looked at the fierce Chen Zhanbiao.

"Alas... why isn't my brother waking up? My fire is not so good..." Chen Zhanbiao drooled, looking at the seated Luo Tian with anticipation.
