The surge of energy spread out, three blue water dragons swaying their massive bodies outside a black fissure.

Luo Tian stood atop the water dragons, his face displaying admiration. He had not expected that beneath the ocean depths there would be such a perilous place. Luo Tian could clearly sense the terrifying aura emanating from within the black fissure.

As his spiritual awareness probed further, Luo Tian's expression turned even more astonished. The black fissure was not a natural phenomenon at all—it was actually the gap of an immense clam.

"Enough talk," Xiang Tianming said, addressing Luo Tian. "There's nothing to be cautious about inside. Every time someone enters, the situation changes, so there are no prior experiences to rely on. Enter!"

Luo Tian nodded. Time was pressing upon him. He took the token made from the water dragon's scales given by Xiang Tianming and, with a flicker of movement, rushed into the black fissure.

"Wait for us!" Chen Hai, Chen Qing, and Chen Bei followed Luo Tian with cold killing intent on their faces.

Four figures rushed into the black fissure under the astonished gazes of the people, but to onlookers, their movements looked as if one was fleeing while three chased.

"Buzz..." As the three entered the black fissure, the massive clam slowly closed, and the black fissure vanished from sight.

Seeing the fissure disappear, Xiang Tianming let out a sigh of admiration and soared toward the clam's body.

"Roar..." Xiang Tianming let out a low growl, his body gradually expanding.

"Is the Grand Master about to reveal his true form?" The surrounding people displayed surprise, their gazes turning toward Xiang Tianming above.

"Roar..." Xiang Tianming roared again, transforming into a colossal beast before the astonished eyes of the Dragon Palace disciples.

Though the water dragons were already massive, and the clam itself was enormous, they appeared like children compared to Xiang Tianming's body.

"The Kunpeng clan truly has unparalleled blessings!" The Dragon Palace disciples' faces bore expressions of awe as they gazed upon Xiang Tianming's true form, a massive creature with a whale's body and an eagle's wings.

"Yes, it is no wonder that the Kunpeng appears only once every thousand years. His vitality is beyond our comprehension. If there were any beast that could rival him, it would only be the Dragon Ancestor," people marveled, their gazes filled with doubt.

"Roar..." Xiang Tianming let out a mighty roar, and the skies over the Northern Sea trembled with towering waves. The Dragon Palace itself shook three times, and gray energy spewed from Xiang Tianming's mouth, enveloping the massive clam.

"By the name of the Kunpeng clan, I reverse yin and yang, lock heaven and earth!" Xiang Tianming's deep voice echoed as he spat out a mouthful of crimson blood mixed with gray energy, covering the entire clam.

"Buzz..." The space around the clam twisted as if distorted, and violent fluctuations surged forth.

Xiang Tianming took a deep breath and transformed back into human form, gazing intently at the clam. "Inside, fifteen days equate to one day outside. I can only help you so much, kid!"

Chapter 730: The Nine Dragon Sons ( )

After completing this, Xiang Tianming vanished from sight. There was only one day left, and he feared for the safety of Dong Yichen and Dong Yan'er. He needed to protect them instead.

Seeing Xiang Tianming disappear, the Dragon Palace disciples sighed in relief. His oppressive presence was too overwhelming, especially when he revealed his true form—his indomitable aura left people gasping for breath.

"Hmph, Xiang Tianming will eventually realize that everything he did was in vain. That strange old man won't come out!"

"Back then, we took over the Dragon Palace. We will reclaim it one day!" The old man's face bore sorrow, his mind cursing as he recalled his brother's death.

"Crack!" Before the old man could continue, a sharp sound made him turn his head in alarm.

The jade pendant with Chen Bei's name on it had shattered, turning into fine powder that scattered with the water.

"This!" The old man's face showed disbelief as he watched the crystalline powder drift away, shouting in alarm.

These three pendants were given to Chen Hai and the others when they entered the Ancestral Dragon Tomb, meant to protect them in case of danger.

But the old man never expected that just after entering, one of their pendants had already shattered—indicating Chen Bei was dead within the tomb.

"This is too fast!" People marveled, surprised that the three had already lost one so quickly.

Most people, however, wore expressions of glee. The water dragon clan's strength was too great. Though Xiang Tianming kept them in check, he wasn't always present at the Dragon Palace. When he was absent, the water dragon clan ruled unchallenged in the Northern Sea.

"Encircle this place! I want to see if it's that old man who killed our water dragon clan!" The old man's face turned cold as he ordered his people.

"Roar..." A dragon's roar echoed, and water dragon clan members rushed to surround the tomb, sealing it completely.

...

Luo Tian was unaware of what happened outside. Chen Bei had indeed been killed by Luo Tian, and it was just bad luck for Chen Bei—his soul had been transported to a place nearly ten thousand zhang away from Luo Tian.

Chen Bei, eager for revenge against Luo Tian, didn't even bother to explain and immediately engaged in a life-or-death battle.

Luo Tian, of course, didn't want to waste time on Chen Bei. Though he had no spiritual energy, his soul was at the peak of魂境 (Soul Ascension), still not a match for Luo Tian's soul.

On the entire Tianyuan Continent, there were only a few Realm-尊 (Realm-Respect) masters. With billions of people, only a handful achieved this level. Their strength was no ordinary feat. Even without spiritual energy, Luo Tian remained a Realm-尊. A Realm-Respect master was inviolable—it wasn't decided by anyone but the laws of heaven. A Realm-Respect master stood above all, and even a wounded one's body was beyond commoners'侮辱 (insult).

Like Jiang Nanxuan's physical form, if not for his appearance, most of the disciples who entered the Xiangu Relic Ground would have perished.

Thus, a Soul Ascension-level master was still no match for Luo Tian unless they had mastered a fragment of chaos power and used advanced martial arts infused with it.

"Fifteen days? That should be enough," Luo Tian grabbed Chen Bei's storage pouch and muttered, then vanished from the spot.

Upon entering the tomb, Luo Tian felt some discomfort but it was only slight. He sensed that besides himself and Chen Hai, there were no living beings inside the tomb.

"Roar..." A deep roar echoed, making Luo Tian turn his head in surprise. Then he was stunned.

Nine golden lights shot into the sky, brightening the already darkened heavens.

Within these golden lights were nine unknown fierce beasts roaring, radiating an overwhelming aura of superiority that filled the entire world.

"The Nine Dragon Sons! That's the offspring of the Dragon Ancestor!" Chen Hai and Chen Qing exclaimed, their faces filled with shock before turning to joy.

"Roar..." The nine golden lights seemed to trigger some kind of array or seal, and the space trembled with roaring dragon sounds. A column of gray energy rose from the ground, forming into serpentine shapes that coiled around the heavens.

"Ten... a hundred... ten thousand..." Countless gray dragon spirits continuously formed, leaving Luo Tian in awe.

"Dragon souls!" Luo Tian could clearly sense the immense soul power contained within these gray dragon spirits.

Chen Hai and Chen Qing also felt the tremendous soul energy in the dragon souls, their faces showing greed.

"Since you've entered, it's fate. You all have dragon blood; absorb it. These dragon spirits have been dead for years, surviving only because of the tomb. You can unleash your dragon blood to attract these souls and devour them, strengthening yourselves." An ancient voice echoed, making the three tremble slightly.

"What's going on? That old man also has dragon blood? How is that possible?" Chen Hai and Chen Qing's faces showed disbelief.

Luo Tian furrowed his brow but then recalled his connection with the Dragon Sword family. The Dragon Sword family was truly a dragon clan, especially Dragon Baby—Dragon Baby's bloodline was so pure and intense that even the Dragon Sword couldn't match it.

Thinking of this, Luo Tian's face showed a playful expression. He hadn't expected such a great opportunity upon entering the tomb.

Now that his soul had reached Realm-Respect, Luo Tian couldn't imagine how much it would elevate after absorbing so many dragon souls.

"Even if you have dragon blood, how can a human surpass us water dragons?" Chen Hai and Chen Qing sneered, sitting cross-legged on the ground as dragon roars erupted from their mouths.

At the same time, two drops of blood flew from their hands into the sky, emitting a terrifying aura.

"Roar..." A moment later, as if stimulated, the roaming dragon souls seemed to sense their kin and rushed toward Chen Hai and Chen Qing.

"Hmph..." Seeing most of the dragon souls heading their way, Chen Hai and Chen Qing sneered and began devouring the surrounding souls.

"Try it!" Luo Tian, unsure of how many dragon souls he could summon, sat cross-legged on the ground. He released a drop of blood, accompanied by roaring dragon sounds into the sky. The dragon souls heading toward Chen Hai and Qing hesitated slightly, with about half of them slowly moving toward Luo Tian.

"What?" Seeing half the dragon souls heading elsewhere, Chen Hai and Qing didn't need to guess—they knew it was Luo Tian's location.

What shocked them even more was that half of the dragon souls were heading toward Luo Tian, while they had two people to summon so many.

Luo Tian was just one person, yet the dragon souls were drawn to him. This was something they couldn't accept—Luo Tian's dragon blood was purer and denser than theirs.

"Damn it, who the hell is this old man? Why does his dragon blood have such intensity!" They cursed as they devoured the souls.

"It's not enough!" Luo Tian's ancient eyes flashed with intensity. Half of the dragon souls, though many, offered no real enhancement for a Realm-Respect master.

He raised his hand and revealed the Nirvana Dragon Seal on his arm, a look of determination on his face.

"The reverse scales of the Dragon Emperor!" Luo Tian roared, and a scale fell from his arm onto his palm.

"Buzz..." Golden light radiated, no less intense than the nine golden pillars.

At the moment the Dragon Emperor's reverse scales detached, all the dragon souls in the tomb let out a roar and rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Enough!" Luo Tian smiled, watching the gray dragon souls forming a storm and rushing toward him.

"What's going on!" Chen Hai and Qing were enjoying the expansion of their soul power when they noticed that the dragon souls gathering around them suddenly turned and rushed toward Luo Tian.

"I feel my father's aura! I felt it!" One of the nine golden lights, a beast with a bull's head and dragon's body, showed excitement.

"So do I! That's my father's aura! My father has successfully reincarnated!" The nine golden lights' images showed excitement as they shouted.

As the roars echoed from the nine lights, the dim space trembled, and countless dragon souls surged into the sky, rushing toward Luo Tian like mad.

Luo Tian's eyes showed a smile as he gazed at the Nirvana Dragon Seal on his arm. The seal's power was now negligible for both him and Dragon Baby, but he hadn't expected it to help so much at this moment.

"Come on, come on!" Luo Tian welcomed the dragon souls without hesitation, as devouring soul energy had become second nature to him. The gray, tangible soul energy formed a massive mouth, allowing the dragon souls to rush in.

"Damn it! Daring to steal our fortune! We haven't settled the score yet, and now you've added another!" Chen Hai and Qing's faces turned dark as they watched the dragon souls around them weaken. They transformed into two streaks of light toward Luo Tian's direction.

Chapter 731: Luo Tian's Secret Weapon ( )

On the Northern Sea floor of the Tianyuan Continent, in the Dragon Tomb, Luo Tian smiled as he absorbed the gray dragon souls rushing toward him.

"Ten thousand... a million... ten million..." Within just one quarter of an hour, Luo Tian had absorbed nearly nine-tenths of the gray dragon souls in the space.

At the same time, he felt his soul had undergone a qualitative leap. Though he still looked old and sensed his lifespan was short, his spiritual awareness had become so powerful it felt like he could see through everything. Even the smallest traces of energy were detectable.

"Unlimited Realm!" Luo Tian muttered, a smile on his face. He could now sense every corner of the Dragon Tomb with his spiritual awareness, including the two streaks of light rushing toward him.

"My dear grandson, you're getting angry," Luo Tian muttered, his eyes filled with amusement. He no longer cared about the remaining ten percent of dragon souls and sat cross-legged, his aura rising into the sky.

"Old man! Stay here!" Qing's face bore intense killing intent. Luo Tian had insulted them in front of the Dragon Palace disciples, killed Chen Bei before, and now absorbed eight-tenths of the dragon souls. Three offenses—each was enough to ignite their rage.

Without hesitation, Qing's water-element spiritual energy, accompanied by the sound of waves, wrapped around his fist and smashed toward Luo Tian.

"My dear grandson, I've left you two-tenths of the dragon souls!" Luo Tian smiled and stood up, his ancient face showing no fear. Though he had no spiritual energy, he was undaunted and punched out.

The collision of fists echoed with thunderous sound, countless dragon souls shattering in the clash and turning into wisps of gray energy floating through the air.

Qing's face showed disbelief, his body emitting a series of cracks as he was sent flying backward and shattered the void.

"Damn it! How is this old man's body stronger than mine!" Qing's face showed terror. The dragon clan had always been confident in their bodies, but now a mere old man had sent him flying.

Hai's face also showed disbelief—his brother had been sent flying by Luo Tian and suffered serious injuries.

They had previously thought that Luo Tian's victory over Chen Bei was due to Xiang Tianming giving him a life-preserving item. Now it seemed they were wrong.

Luo Tian's eyes flickered and he didn't give Qing any chance, as there was still Chen Hai, who had mastered a fragment of chaos power. His current body, though strong, was still vulnerable against an opponent who had mastered a fragment of soul power.

In the moment they were stunned, Luo Tian pushed off the ground with his legs and, relying solely on his body's strength, became a streak of light rushing toward Qing. He channeled all tenfold power into his punch, and the fist of a Realm-Respect body struck Qing's head.

"Crack..." The sound of bones breaking echoed, and Qing felt his head throb with pain. In the next moment, he lost consciousness.

Blood splattered as Qing's head exploded in Hai's shocked gaze, three gray dragon souls flying out of his body and toward the eyes, filled with endless hatred.

"My brother! I want him dead! Help me avenge!" The low growl of the three gray dragon souls echoed, not fleeing but rushing toward Hai.

"You should die first!"

"Blue Crystal Luminous Fire!" Luo Tian's aged voice echoed in the void. The blue-green flames formed a vast sea of fire, enveloping the three dragon souls and burning them to ashes.

"Roar..." The dragon souls that had been gathering toward Luo Tian scattered like avoiding a plague upon the appearance of Blue Crystal Luminous Fire.

Blue Crystal Luminous Fire had fully recovered with Luo Tian's return, becoming his greatest asset.

"You!" Seeing his brother vanish in less than a breath, Hai's face was dark with anger.

"Boom..." At the moment Qing died, the jade pendant on the old man's waist remaining from the water dragon clan also shattered with a loud sound, turning into blue-green powder and vanishing in the water.

"Damn it! Qing is dead!" The old man's face was dark with anger, his gaze fixed on the Dragon Tomb as he longed to enter himself.

Other water dragon clan members were also shocked, not expecting their clan's genius to be lost so quickly.

"Haier, please don't get hurt!" The old man gently took the last jade pendant on his waist and spoke with trembling hands. At this moment, he no longer wanted to kill Luo Tian but only hoped that the last genius of the water dragon clan would not be in trouble.

...

"Boom..."

A powerful fluctuation continued to echo within the Dragon Tomb, and Luo Tian's aged eyes bore deep concentration.

"I've truly declined too much!" Luo Tian muttered, gazing at the vigorously energetic Hai.

"Old man! No wonder, it's a body-bound Realm-Respect master. I never thought there would be such an odd person in the world!" Hai took a deep breath.

After several试探 (testing) exchanges, Hai had confirmed that Luo Tian was a body-bound Realm-Respect master.

"What's the use of being a body-bound Realm-Respect? I've suppressed it before!" Hai's face showed disdain, his deep roar echoing from his mouth.

At that moment, a dragon dozens of zhang long appeared before Luo Tian, its two eyes like twin suns, radiating cold killing intent toward Luo Tian.

Looking at the massive water dragon that seemed like a mountain, if measured by volume alone, Luo Tian's body looked like an ant.

"This is my water dragon clan's strongest form. I wonder what you'll use to fight me!" Hai, transformed into a water dragon, said coldly. His massive tail swept through the void toward Luo Tian.

"Good, it's within my range!" Luo Tian secretly assessed Hai's body strength and showed no fear. His withered body rushed toward the massive tail.

"Boom..." Two bodies of unequal size collided violently, and the entire space trembled.

Luo Tian's face turned pale as he felt the icy scales on Hai's tail, and he was sent flying backward.

Hai also suffered greatly; his tail felt as if it had been broken, and his massive body rolled over, crushing a vast expanse of void before stopping after flying thousands of zhang.

Luo Tian stepped out from the void, a faint smile on his face: "My dear grandson, you're being disrespectful!"

As the words fell, Luo Tian's aged body transformed into a streak of light and rushed toward Hai.

"Can't fight directly, the Realm-Respect body is stronger than my current state. If I clash head-on, I'll still be at a disadvantage!" Hai calculated in his mind, his dragon eyes flashing with intelligence. He thought of Luo Tian's lack of spiritual energy.

Thinking this, Hai opened his mouth and a sound like waves echoed out, accompanied by echoing sounds.

"Roar..." Blue spiritual energy spewed from Hai's mouth, like a wave of the ocean, carrying immense power toward Luo Tian. Then, a gray mist entered the waves, causing the sea dragon to tremble again. The blue waves turned gray and rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Dragon breath!" Luo Tian stopped, his face showing concern. If he had spiritual energy, he could suppress this simple dragon breath with a single hand.

But now, not only did he lack spiritual energy, but the vast chaos power within his body had also been taken by the Book of Epochs, leaving only a fragment.

"Can't fight directly!" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed as his hands quickly changed, using the only martial art he could now perform.

"The human who has my father's blood seems a bit strange. This water dragon clan's boy is indeed strong!" Nine golden lights' images discussed among themselves, their gazes on the battle between Luo Tian and Hai.

"Rest assured, one who has signed a Nirvana contract with my father's reincarnation is no ordinary person. He must have had great fortune and opportunity, so he won't lose so easily!" The first golden light's image of a bull-headed dragon said softly.

"Hey... you two, fight hard! Whoever wins will get our nine's fortune!" To prevent their battle from ending too quickly, the other eight golden lights' images spoke with thunderous voices that echoed into Luo Tian and Hai's ears.

Hearing the nine golden lights' voices, Luo Tian and Hai were both shocked. The fortune of the nine dragon sons was enough to move anyone's heart, even a half-step Realm-Respect master wouldn't give it up.

"I'll take it! The inheritance of the nine dragon sons, if I obtain it, I will be the next Dragon Ancestor!" Hai's mind roared as he poured all his gray chaos power into the gray waves.

"Rippling..." The gray waves, carrying overwhelming might, broke through the void and rushed toward Luo Tian.

"I must get it! After obtaining it, my strength will be stronger!" Luo Tian's aged eyes were bloodshot as his hands quickly changed, and a powerful fluctuation radiated from his hands.

"Buzz..." A massive gray seal formed in Luo Tian's hands, the Soul-Stealing Seal he hadn't used for a long time. It was the only martial art Luo Tian could now perform without spiritual energy.

Luo Tian's soul had become so powerful it surpassed the Realm-Respect level, and the Soul-Stealing Seal's power was now overwhelming.

Luo Tian also put all his strength into it, converting all his spiritual awareness into the Soul-Stealing Seal. Its power was enough to kill a Realm-Respect master, and it was his last resort and only secret weapon.

Chapter 732: The Nine Dragon Sons' Meridians ( )

Northern Sea Dragon Tomb.

Luo Tian stood in the sky, his face showing endless coldness as he gazed at the massive Hai.

"Shocked!" At this moment, Hai's heart was completely taken over by shock. His massive body trembled in the sky as he looked at Luo Tian's front, though invisible to the eye. However, his strong dragon perception could sense that the fluctuation in Luo Tian's hands was something he couldn't withstand.

In front of this aura, Hai knew he was an ant. This aura could destroy a Realm-Respect master, let alone himself at the peak of魂境 (Soul Ascension).

"Buzz..." A wild aura spread out, and Luo Tian pushed his hands forward. The invisible Soul-Stealing Seal emitted a buzzing sound and rushed toward Hai.

At the same time, Hai's dragon breath also let out a thunderous roar and rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Boom..." However, when the two martial arts met, Hai's massive dragon breath shattered instantly and turned into a shower of water droplets filling the sky.

"Run!" Hai didn't hesitate, his only thought was to escape. His massive tail swept through the void and dove into it.

"Want to run? Can you escape?" Luo Tian's aged mouth slightly curled, his face showing disdain as he looked at the massive water dragon's body that had already entered halfway.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian's words fell, the Soul-Stealing Seal struck Hai's body with overwhelming might and emitted a dull sound.

It was as if thunder had sounded on the ground, and the sky shattered, revealing patches of void.

More terrifying was that Hai's massive body disappeared segment by segment within thirty breaths, and even the three souls were not left behind. There was no chance for them to escape as soul fragments.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian took a deep breath, feeling exhausted. He looked toward the nine golden lights in the distance as if on the horizon.

"Boom..." Luo Tian's body slowly fell to the ground. Though it seemed calm, that one Soul-Stealing Seal had drained all his spiritual awareness. His body also suffered damage from the collision with Hai, and his already aged body reached its limit, causing him to faint.

"The old man is really tough!" The nine golden lights' beasts showed a strange expression, clearly sensing the abnormality in Luo Tian's body and his dwindling lifespan.

"Never mind, let it be what it is. Since he won, we'll help him!" The first golden light's bull-headed dragon spoke.

"Good! This old man has a connection with our father, so we'll help him!" The second golden light's beast spoke. At the same time, Luo Tian's body emitted a teleportation force, and in an instant, he appeared before the nine golden lights.

"Old man, today I'll give you a great fortune because of your connection with our father!" The voice echoed from the nine lights.

Instead of a single golden light, it was nine different colors. While people knew the strength of the Dragon Ancestor's nine sons, they didn't know that each had a single element. Though it was just one element, they had mastered it to the extreme.

"By my残躯 (frail body), I'll become a golden meridian to help you grasp the true essence of gold!" The eldest son of the Dragon Ancestor, Chou Niu, roared and transformed into a golden light that rushed into Luo Tian's body.

"By my残躯 (frail body), I'll become a wooden meridian to help you grasp the true essence of wood!" After Chou Niu, Pi Xiu roared and transformed into a green light that rushed into Luo Tian's body.

The roaring continued, each time followed by a streak of light rushing into Luo Tian's body.

Gold, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, thunder, light, and darkness—nine streaks of elemental lights rushed into Luo Tian's body. He trembled, slowly opening his eyes with confusion.

"A great fortune!" As Luo Tian regained consciousness, he realized he had encountered a great fortune. He clearly felt nine thick meridians in his body spreading out and radiating light.

"Nine elements!" Luo Tian muttered, his eyes filled with contemplation.

"Kid, remember to take good care of our father!" The nine voices entered Luo Tian's mind, making him frown slightly.

"Dragon Baby?" Luo Tian couldn't think of any dragon clan that would make these half-step Realm-Respect nine dragon sons speak like this.

"Unexpectedly, I've benefited from Dragon Baby here!" Luo Tian's corner of his eye showed a smile as he closed his eyes to feel the restoration of his meridians.

At this moment, nine meridians in Luo Tian's body continuously branched out, flowing through his body. He felt comfortable and let out a hum.

Luo Tian seemed to have forgotten the passage of time, forgetting everything as he closed his eyes and felt the gradual restoration of his spiritual energy.

"One day... three days..." Time passed slowly, and ten days had slipped away under Luo Tian's closed eyes.

Meanwhile, in the Northern Sea, the water dragon clan's people were watching closely from outside the tomb, their faces filled with cold killing intent as they gazed into the tomb.

"Damn it! That old man must be the one who killed Chen Hai and the others!" The leader's face was clenched with teeth.

"Kill him! Even if he is Xiang Tianming's friend, it doesn't matter. Killing our three geniuses—this isn't over! He'll be dismembered!" The surrounding water dragon clan members shouted, waiting for the tomb to open. Even if Luo Tian didn't come out, they would enter the tomb and kill him.

The loss of three geniuses had deeply hurt the water dragon clan, their future hopes and aspirations to replace Xiang Tianming. Now they had died in the tomb under their watch, and the water dragon clan didn't believe it was the ancestors of the tomb causing this.

"Buzz..." A fluctuation of spiritual energy spread out, and as the water dragon clan's people spoke, the seals arranged by Xiang Tianming on the massive clam broke one after another.

"Boom... boom..." The seals shattered into wisps of gray energy, dispersing in the sky and leaving the water dragon clan people shocked.

"Is this because Xiang Tianming's seal has expired, or did something happen inside the tomb to break it?" The water dragon clan people looked at the shattered seals, their voices filled with confusion.

"Crack..." A clear sound echoed as the golden seals shattered, and the massive clam slowly opened. Nine streaks of light shot into the sky, causing a stormy wave in the Northern Sea's skies. Finally, the spiritual energy formed a massive spiritual vortex, lifting waves and creating a fierce water whirlpool that extended to the depths of the sea, entering the slowly opening massive clam.

"What kind of person has broken through to cause such a commotion? Could it be that old man Luo? Impossible, he's already at the end of his life!" The water dragon clan people showed madness on their faces, disbelieving their suspicions.

On the other hand, inside the tomb, Luo Tian transformed like a beast of prey, hungrily absorbing spiritual energy into his body. The nine main meridians in his body had spiritual energy like rivers, continuously rolling and finally gathering into his dantian. This caused a series of booming sounds within his body.

The massive spiritual energy entered Luo Tian's body, and his aura gradually rose from the cultivation stage to a sudden leap into Realm-Respect.

"Supreme!" Luo Tian muttered, sensing his strength and whispering in a daze with an enlightened look. He knew that with the enhancement of his strength, he had finally understood what realm existed beyond Realm-Respect.

"Realm-Respect, the master of a world. There are no more than ten in the entire Tianyuan Continent!" Luo Tian's mind imprinted some names, including Zhang Daotian, Yin Tianxiong, the Demon尊 (Demon Lord), Xiang Tianming, and others.

Beyond Realm-Respect was the Supreme Realm. If Realm-Respect was the ultimate cultivation level of the Tianyuan Continent, then the Supreme Realm was entirely beyond the scope of the Tianyuan Continent. That's how the rules of the Tianyuan Continent were set.

Thus, no one on the entire Tianyuan Continent could enter the Supreme Realm. It was only possible to reach a half-step Supreme Realm, like himself now with his spiritual awareness entering the Supreme Realm.

The Supreme Realm also had varying strengths. If his body and spiritual energy fully entered the Supreme Realm, he would be a single-source Supreme Master. If he truly entered the Supreme Realm, even a single-source Supreme Master would have the power to destroy one domain of the Tianyuan Continent.

"A half-step Supreme Realm should be enough!" Luo Tian muttered, and as he spoke, the wild aura within the tomb gradually stabilized.

Outside, in the Western Regions, one day had passed since the battle. One day had turned the Western Regions into a river of blood, with countless disciples and wandering cultivators from various sects on the Tianyuan Continent dying in that massive battlefield like a meat grinder.

"Buzz..." A golden dragon over a hundred zhang long let out a thunderous roar, its golden scales glimmering with cold light. Long Jie's golden dragon eyes showed disbelief as he gazed toward the Northern Sea, a massive aura spreading through the void.

"Advancement? Long Jie has entered Realm-Respect?" People showed disbelief, their faces filled with shock as they watched Long Jie's body grow even larger.

Chapter 733: Journey to the Western Battlefield ( )
