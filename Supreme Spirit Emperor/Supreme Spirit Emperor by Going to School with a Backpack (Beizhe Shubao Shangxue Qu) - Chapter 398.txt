“Warrior Spear, from now on you'll reside in the Divine Clan. Believe it or not, after ten or twenty years here, this entire Divine Clan might be bankrupted by your appetite!” Zheng Xin and the others smiled, their eyes gazing at the large cauldrons before Chen Zhanbiao. As his power grew, Chen's hunger became even more insatiable; Zheng Xin and the others called it brutal.

The Divine Clan's people watched Chen Zhanbiao, their lips twitching. Upon hearing Zheng Xin's words, a thought of the entire Divine Clan being devoured by Chen Zhanbiao's gluttony arose in their hearts.

"Everyone has recovered, right?" Luo Tian smiled as he stepped into the hall, causing a wave of joy on everyone's faces.

"Luotian, you've recovered!" Everyone stood up in unison, their eyes filled with smiles as they gazed at Luo Tian.

"Big Brother!" Chen Zhanbiao, now restored to his robust physique, approached Luo Tian and spoke in a deep voice.

"Good, just recover," Luo Tian habitually patted Chen Zhanbiao's shoulder before speaking softly: "Since everyone has recovered, let's visit the old Divine King and then leave!"

"Luotian..." As Luo Tian's words faded, a voice echoed through the hall. A figure stood outside the hall, gazing at Luo Tian and his companions.

"Sun Feiwen, you bastard! You once teamed up with Luotian to knock me out!" Upon seeing Sun Feiwen, Sun Kemin recalled old memories.

"Sun Kemin, you damn fool! What have you done in our Divine Clan these days? Hand over the stolen items from the Divine King's tomb immediately, or I'll fight you to death!" Upon seeing Sun Kemin, Sun Feiwen seemed to see an enemy. He had heard everything about the Divine Clan's recent events.

"Rubbish! If it weren't for me saving you, you'd have been incinerated in the Slaughter Prison! As a reward, can't you pay some price?" Sun Kemin retorted fiercely, his face filled with contempt.

"Who said it was your doing? It was Luo Tian and the others who saved me!" Sun Feiwen clearly wasn't one to back down, and he began arguing with Sun Kemin.

"Right, I also feel that Sun Kemin isn't very honorable. Should we all attack this glutton and strip him again?" Diao Dezhu and the others, always eager for trouble, eyed Sun Kemin with ill intent.

"What are you planning?" Sun Kemin noticed the group approaching him, his eyes turning cautious. He knew these bastards were capable of anything.

"Nothing much, my little brother's just a bit short on funds. I wanted to borrow some from you, Brother Sun!" The group surrounded Sun Kemin, rubbing their hands in anticipation of the first strike.

"Enough fooling around. How's the old Divine King?" Luo Tian sighed, feeling a headache as he looked at the troublemakers. He turned to Sun Feiwen.

"He's recovered and has been waiting for you to emerge from seclusion!" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Sun Feiwen and the others straightened their faces. Sun Feiwen addressed Luo Tian.

"Let's go. Take me to see him!" Luo Tian sighed deeply; he needed an explicit stance from Sun Shengtian.

"No need. I'm here!" As Luo Tian's words finished, the old Divine King Sun Shengtian appeared at the hall's entrance.

Yet, Sun Shengtian was no longer as sharp as before. His entire being seemed like that of an old man, though his cultivation had returned. However, a fatigue lingered on his face.

"Respectful elder!" Luo Tian bowed slightly, gazing at Sun Shengtian. His heart gave a slight jolt; he couldn't explain why, but Sun Shengtian felt different. Though the latter looked like an old man now, a sense of apprehension stirred within Luo Tian.

"Thank you for this time!" Sun Shengtian smiled, bowing to Luo Tian. Now both were at the same cultivation level, they could now address each other as equals.

"Elder, why did you end up in such a state? And where is Brother Sun Miechen now?" Luo Tian asked directly, voicing the question on everyone's mind. Even the Divine Clan people looked puzzled at Sun Shengtian, wondering why he had appeared in the Slaughter Prison.

"Ah, it was just a betrayal. As for Miechen, he might no longer be alive!" Sun Shengtian spoke, his eyes carrying a hint of sorrow.

"That's not right. I was severely injured before, but I saw Sun Miechen leave that cell!" Chen Zhanbiao spoke up, recalling the scene.

"Reincarnation!" Sun Feiwen interjected, his eyes filled with hatred. He took over Chen Zhanbiao's words.

"We were betrayed because we opposed the union of the Divine and Demon Clans. After all, their feud had lasted for a long time. If they merged, it would inevitably collapse and perhaps even ignite a war between the two clans!"

"However, after that, Sun Hengyang and Nan Gong Wuai attacked us. And there was a very powerful entity secretly aiding them. To this day, we still don't know who it is. But later in the Slaughter Prison, we felt a powerful divine soul!"

"My talent was good but ordinary. Therefore, the entity didn't target me or the old Divine King."

"If I'm not mistaken, it first aimed to reincarnate Chen Zhanbiao but failed. At that time, when trying to reincarnate Chen Zhanbiao, it apparently triggered something within his body. It then screamed and fled from Chen Zhanbiao's body!" Sun Feiwen spoke, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao.

"It must be a life-preserving item left by the King of the蛮族 for his descendants!" People then understood. After all, Chen Zhanbiao was the son of an ancient king but placed among humans. It was impossible for him to be left without anything, let alone abandoned.

"So that powerful divine soul had no choice but to target Miechen!" Sun Shengtian, clearly aware of the situation, spoke with a touch of sorrow. After all, Sun Miechen was his son.

"Everything fits! It must have been when we attacked the Divine Clan, that entity was trying to reincarnate Miechen. Therefore, it didn't act. When we defeated Sun Hengyang and Nan Gong Wuai along with the strong warriors of both clans, that entity had just finished reincarnating Miechen and hadn't had time to kill Chen Zhanbiao and the others. It escaped from the Slaughter Prison!"

Luo Tian muttered quietly, his gaze heavy with thought. He recalled the sense of crisis he had felt during his previous conversation with Xuanyu Qiong, which must have come from that hidden divine soul. It was likely the Soul-Subduing Master.

"So, it's possible that Sun Miechen is no longer Sun Miechen now? He might have become that Soul-Subduing Master who attacked before?" Diao Dezhu and the others looked enlightened.

"A terrifying Soul-Subduing Master, capable of reincarnating Sun Miechen!" People were awed by the Soul-Subduing Master's power.

"Who exactly is it?" Everyone felt a shadow over their hearts, sensing this enemy was formidable.

At once, everyone pitied Sun Shengtian. A son with such extraordinary talent had been taken over like this, a parent losing their child.

"Elder, I hope you'll find comfort. Perhaps Brother Miechen still has a chance!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, never expecting his former powerful opponent to end up like this. He felt a pang of sorrow for Sun Miechen.

The Eternal Immortal Body was equally extraordinary. Among peers, it could also aspire to enlightenment, matching the level of a Chronological Lord or a King's Son. Yet it was wasted on others.

Luo Tian merely offered words of comfort. As a Soul-Subduing Master, he knew the power of such entities. If truly reincarnated by a Soul-Subduing Master, there was almost no chance of recovery.

"Let's just say Miechen had bad luck!" Sun Shengtian sighed softly, then gazed at Luo Tian: "No matter what, I thank you. If it weren't for your help, I might have been erased in the Slaughter Prison."

"My promise still holds. As long as I am the Divine King, the Divine Clan will never be at odds with the Four Sacred Star Domains!" Sun Shengtian spoke softly, making a promise.

"Then we'll take our leave. Thank you for your hospitality!" Luo Tian spoke softly, standing up and bowing to Sun Shengtian and Sun Feiwen. He had done his part well. If it were anyone else, they might have taken advantage of the situation and killed Sun Shengtian and Sun Feiwen, possibly seizing control of the Divine Clan.

"Then I won't keep you. The Divine Clan might now be entering a period of turmoil!" Sun Shengtian spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian nodded, addressing Diao Dezhu and the others. His voice echoed through the Divine Clan's sacred mountains: "Monkey, it's time to go!"

Chapter 1574: I'll Take You There()

"Got it!" Yao Chen's face glowed with divine light. His figure darted, chasing after Luo Tian and the others.

"Finally gone!" A golden puppet rose from the ground, following Yao Chen's path and flying away from the Divine Clan.

"Finally gone!" The Divine Clan people watched the golden lights, their faces filled with excitement.

"Finally gone! These pests, these locusts!" As Luo Tian and the others left the Divine Clan's land, the people cheered, collapsing onto the ground as if drained of energy.

However, after the cheers, the Divine Clan people fell into silence. The Divine Clan was now in a dire state.

With the overall strength of the Nine Domains having increased significantly, the Divine and Demon Clans as the first domain among them had other sects with formidable strength. Some sects even possessed Chronological Peak-level beings.

At present, the Divine Clan had only Sun Shengtian and Sun Feiwen at the Chronological Peak. The people of the Divine Clan feared these two might not be able to control the sects.

Although Luo Tian and his group had caused anger among the Divine Clan people, their presence as a金字招牌 (golden reputation) ensured no one dared to defy the Divine Clan. Now that Luo Tian and his group had left, their fear of them naturally disappeared.

"Alright, everyone go do your own things. From today on, Sun Feiwen will be the new Divine King of our clan!"

"Throughout the years that our Divine Clan has stood in the Nine Domains, we've faced worse situations. But we always overcame them. Don't lose heart; regain our former pride!" Sun Shengtian's voice echoed across the Divine Clan land, still carrying a commanding tone.

"Yes!" Upon hearing Sun Shengtian's words, the Divine Clan people slightly regained confidence. Though their clan was now in ruins, it was still their root. If the Divine Clan were destroyed, their fate wouldn't be much better.

...

Luo Tian and his group weren't too concerned. They had done their part, and whether the Divine Clan survived or not was no longer their problem.

However, Luo Tian had left a large number of elixirs for Sun Feiwen. After all, they had some history together. Luo Tian still hoped that Sun Feiwan would live well.

"Sun Feiwen has finally taken the throne, right?" Diao Dezhu and the others followed Luo Tian, whispering among themselves.

"The Demon Clan shouldn't be too much of a concern. After all, the Demon Clan's strength has lost half but is still far stronger than the Divine Clan. Plus, Li Tianzhi and Ren Hongzhe have returned to the Demon Clan with a Chronological Treasure. I'm sure no one would dare to act!" Luo Tian muttered quietly, not planning to go back to the Demon Clan. They had spent too long in the Beast and Divine-Demon Domains.

"Little Master, I'm sorry. Please let me return to a divine soul! I haven't had enough of you!" However, as they flew, Gu Yongkang continuously begged Luo Tian.

"What's wrong?" Luo Tian smiled. He knew that during this time, Gu Yongkang must have suffered a lot from being fused with the puppet.

"I..." Gu Yongkang wanted to speak but glanced at Yao Chen and shook his head slightly.

"I just want to follow the Little Master. I can't bear to part from the Little Master! I thought I could still serve the Little Master as a puppet, but I didn't expect..."

"In truth, my heart still belongs to the Little Master!" Gu Yongkang transmitted his thoughts to Luo Tian. He dared not say it in front of Yao Chen. These past months had been the most tormenting mentally for Gu Yongkang.

"There's nothing to be done. You've already fused with the puppet and can't separate!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, trying to convince Gu Yongkang to give up this hope.

"What did I do in my past life to deserve this?" Gu Yongkang mentally cried out. But since Luo Tian said there was no way, it truly was impossible.

After flying for three days, they finally crossed the Divine-Demon Domain and entered the Slaughter Domain.

"This is the Slaughter Domain!" Upon entering, everyone marveled, their eyes filled with admiration.

Luo Tian and his group were visiting the Slaughter Domain for the first time. As soon as they entered, they smelled a scent of blood and felt a battle nearby. Two people at the Saint level were clashing, shaking this starry sky.

The entire Slaughter Domain's starry sky was a dark red, different from the fiery red of the Fire Domain. It resembled blood.

"This is the survival rule of the Slaughter Domain: only the strong survive! The weak can only be oppressed!" Luo Tian's vast divine sense spread out, instantly sensing a wave of killing intent around them.

"A cruel star domain!" Luo Tian sighed deeply and then his face lit up with a glow. His Chronological Peak-level aura spread out instantly, making the hidden killing intent disappear.

"This star domain also suits me!" Yao Chen licked his lips. He felt that coming out with Luo Tian was definitely the right choice. He had already enjoyed fighting in the Divine-Demon Domain, and now entering this Slaughter Domain made him even more excited.

Then Yao Chen dashed like a wild horse, disappearing from the sight of Luo Tian and his group.

"Find the Bone Forest for me. Let me know when you do, I'll come right away!" Yao Chen's voice echoed in Luo Tian and his group's ears.

"A real monkey, can't stay still for a moment!" Seeing Yao Chen's behavior, Luo Tian was speechless.

"What do we do next? We know the Bone Forest is in the Slaughter Domain, but we don't know which direction it's in!" Diao Dezhu and the others looked troubled.

"It's not hard," Zheng Xin smiled, his figure flickered out of sight and appeared tens of thousands of feet away. He reached into the void.

"A low-level Chronological Initial, daring to have killing intent towards us!" Zheng Xin's face showed disdain. He pulled out a short-statured young man.

Though called a youth, one who had reached the Chronological Initial level was certainly not in his twenties. Just like Luo Tian and his group, now hundreds of years old but still appearing young. This youth might be even older than Luo Tian's age.

But compared to those who were tens of thousands of years old, Luo Tian and his group could still be considered young.

"Master, I'm sorry. I was just passing by!" The youth, caught by Zheng Xin, turned pale instantly.

"Don't play dumb. Tell me where the Bone Forest is in the Slaughter Domain!" Zheng Xin spoke softly, his tone indifferent. He didn't really intend to harm the youth.

"The Bone Forest! Master, you mean the Bone Forest!" Upon hearing Zheng Xin's words, the youth's face turned pale. The Nine Domains' most dangerous places—Luo Tian and his group would avoid them unless desperate. Even a Chronological Initial-level person wouldn't dare to enter.

"Master, I'm not unwilling. It's just that I don't know where the Bone Forest is!" The youth smiled bitterly, addressing Zheng Xin. At this moment, he finally recognized Luo Tian and his group's faces. He immediately identified them, especially looking at Luo Tian with a fervent gaze as if seeing a deity.

"You're not a native of the Slaughter Domain, so how come you don't know where the Bone Forest is?" Zheng Xin's face darkened, sensing the youth was lying.

"Master, in the Slaughter Domain there are two places most mysterious. One is the Slaughter City, also the core of the Slaughter Domain. No one can find where the Slaughter City is located!"

"The other is this Bone Forest, which is called a dangerous place. However, the Bone Forest appears in different places of the Slaughter Domain at times. As for when it appears and where, there's no pattern!" The youth spoke respectfully to Luo Tian and his group.

"Ah, I see!" Upon hearing the youth's words, Luo Tian and his group sighed deeply. They then erased the youth's memories during this time and tossed him back.

"This is really troublesome! What do we do next?" Diao Dezhu and the others looked troubled, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Search!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He hadn't expected the Bone Forest to be so strange.

"Should we split up and search? If someone is lucky, they might find it!" Zheng Xin and the others spoke. This was their only idea.

Luo Tian's brow furrowed slightly. Though this method was the best they could think of, Luo Tian didn't want to split up. Although their strength had increased significantly and they were among the top of the Nine Domains, the incident with Chen Zhanbiao had sounded a warning bell for Luo Tian.

"We should find the Slaughter City first. Maybe Yan Hongtao has some ideas to locate the Bone Forest!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, though he didn't want to contact the Slaughter Domain people. But this was his only idea now. Relying on luck alone, he couldn't afford it.

After Luo Tian spoke, he reached out again. The youth Zheng Xin had sent back appeared in front of them.

"Master!" The youth forgot the previous incident with Zheng Xin and spoke nervously again.

"When will the Slaughter City appear to recruit fresh blood?" Luo Tian asked, his face showing a slight smile.

"No need to wait. I can take you into the Slaughter City right now!" As Luo Tian's words finished, a mocking voice echoed in his ears. A blood-red light suddenly appeared behind him.

Chapter 1575: Slaughter City()

The blood-red light, like icy fangs, appeared behind Luo Tian and lunged toward his back.

"Truly..." Luo Tian smiled, twisting his body in an impossible direction. He then reached out and grabbed the blood-red light.

"What?" The attacker let out an astonished sound. It was because Luo Tian's body movement was too strange.

"Crackling..." A piercing sound echoed from Luo Tian's hand. A blood-red sword burst into red light in his grip.

"Yan Hongtao, it's been years. You're using this method to greet me?" Luo Tian smiled, looking at the figure holding the blood-red sword. He spoke softly.

"Yan Hongtao!" Diao Dezhu and the others immediately recognized Yan Hongtao. They hadn't expected to meet him here.

"A terrifying fellow, I didn't sense his presence at all!" Diao Dezhu and the others looked serious. They gazed at Yan Hongtao, feeling that if he wanted to kill them, even if they could withstand it, they might still be severely injured.

"Everyone, long time no see!" Yan Hongtao sheathed his blood-red sword and gazed at Diao Dezhu, Zheng Xin, and the others with a look of admiration.

"Yan Hongtao, you just appeared and wanted to kill us?" Diao Dezhu and the others teased.

"You once stole my Chronological Scripture, causing me to be chased by the Divine Clan. I haven't settled that score with you yet! Now you're coming to our Slaughter Domain, do you think I'm invisible?" Yan Hongtao's face showed coldness as he glanced at Diao Dezhu.

"Stop acting tough. You used to be beaten half-dead by Luo Tian. Now you're coming after Luo Tian? Are you brave enough?" Diao Dezhu showed contempt, not taking Yan Hongtao seriously at all.

"Damn it!" Yan Hongtao's face turned dark, feeling as if bitten by a mad dog. He glared at Diao Dezhu.

"Diao Dezhu, shut up!" Luo Tian's face darkened. They had matters to ask him, and this guy was already arguing with him.

"Exactly, Diao Dezhu, don't say more. Who's the one who's short-sighted? You're not rubbing salt into his wounds?" Zheng Xin spoke up, his eyes showing satisfaction.

"Short-sighted..." Upon hearing Zheng Xin's words, Yan Hongtao almost spat out old blood. He gazed at Zheng Xin: "You're the one who's short-sighted! Your whole family is short-sighted!"

"Everyone just shut up!" Luo Tian felt a headache, shouting at Zheng Xin and the others.

Upon hearing Luo Tian's shout, Diao Dezhu and Zheng Xin fell silent. They gazed at Luo Tian, waiting for his next words.

"Yan Brother, how did you know we came to the Slaughter Domain?" Luo Tian's face showed confusion. He couldn't understand why Yan Hongtao had found them so quickly.

"You still underestimate our Slaughter Domain. Though we aren't the top in overall strength, we are unrivaled in assassination or killing. Our intelligence network has spread across the Nine Domains. I knew about you as soon as you entered the Slaughter Domain!" Yan Hongtao smiled, gazing at Luo Tian.

"You made quite a commotion in the Divine-Demon Domain!" Yan Hongtao's face showed admiration. He gazed at Luo Tian, who could never have imagined that the one he once had to flee from was now so accomplished.

"Yan Brother, I just want to ask if your Slaughter Domain has found a way to locate the Bone Forest!" Luo Tian gazed at Yan Hongtao, his eyes filled with admiration. He hadn't expected the Slaughter Domain's intelligence to be so strong, so maybe the Slaughter City did have a way to locate the Bone Forest.

"I can take you into the Slaughter City. As for whether there's a way, I'll check it out for you!" Yan Hongtao smiled, addressing Luo Tian and the others.

"Thank you. If we truly find it, I'll definitely reward you generously!" Luo Tian's eyes showed gratitude as he spoke to Yan Hongtao.

They had no real friendship, and they had even clashed before. But now Yan Hongtao was leading them into the Slaughter City and actively helping to find the Bone Forest. This made Luo Tian feel indebted.

"Alright, you've done a lot for humanity over the years. Helping you isn't a big deal. Moreover, we've also had some interest in this Bone Forest!" Yan Hongtao's eyes showed indifference. He led Luo Tian and the others toward the depths of the Slaughter Domain.

Along the way, Luo Tian once again experienced the cruelty of the Slaughter Domain. After flying for a day, he and his group saw hundreds of battles—life-and-death fights that were extremely brutal.

"In our Slaughter City, we release a kill list at intervals. If you can assassinate the people on the kill list, you'll receive a generous reward from the employer. This is our survival rule in the Slaughter Domain!" Yan Hongtao introduced the Slaughter Domain to Luo Tian and his group along the way.

Yan Hongtao had come out for an assassination mission, targeting a sect leader in the Divine-Demon Domain. Upon returning, he received news that Luo Tian was heading to the Slaughter Domain. Therefore, Yan Hongtao had waited at the entrance.

"You're also on our Slaughter City's kill list... and the bounty is absurd!" Yan Hongtao smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

"Oh? What's the bounty?" Luo Tian and his group showed interest, gazing at Yan Hongtao.

"A seed of an immortal herb that never dies!" Yan Hongtao spoke, recounting the bounty for assassinating Luo Tian. This made Luo Tian and his group gasp.

"Who is it? Who would spend so much to get your life?" Diao Dezhu and the others asked, wanting to know who was willing to spend so much to get Luo Tian's life.

"Don't try to pry into my secrets. We have rules; we can't reveal the employer's information. But don't worry, no one would dare to take this task. This mission has been on our Slaughter City for decades!" Yan Hongtao showed contempt, addressing Luo Tian.

"When you run out of money, just send Luo Tian to the Slaughter Domain!" Sun Kemin's face showed greed as he gazed at Luo Tian, as if seeing a treasure. This gaze only appeared when Sun Kemin encountered a big tomb.

"Get lost..." Luo Tian kicked Sun Kemin away. Everyone was lively, following Yan Hongtao.

After flying for another day, Yan Hongtao led Luo Tian and his group to a deserted continent. They appeared before an unremarkable mountain.

The mountain was ordinary, and from the outside, there was no special feature. A dark cave appeared in front of Luo Tian's group.

"Let's go!" Yan Hongtao spoke softly, stepping into the cave first. It was no different from an ordinary cave.

Though the cave was dark, it wasn't a problem for Luo Tian and his group. After about an hour of walking, they saw an altar ten feet wide and long with flowing symbols.

"Teleportation array?" They immediately recognized the symbols on the altar as a teleportation array.

"It's a one-time teleportation array!" Wan Lingkong spoke softly. As an expert in formations, he naturally understood formations. Almost instantly upon seeing the teleportation array, he recognized it as a one-time teleportation array.

"Correct. Our Slaughter City people always carry such an altar when they go out. After returning, we place it in a hidden spot for future use to return to the Slaughter City!" Yan Hongtao spoke softly.

"Really cautious!" Upon hearing Yan Hongtao's words, Diao Dezhu and the others showed contempt.

"We Slaughter Domain people are all killers. We basically only trust ourselves. This is our tradition in the Slaughter City. To become an excellent killer, first ensure your base isn't discovered!" Yan Hongtao didn't take Diao Dezhu and the others' words seriously.

"Let's go!" Yan Hongtao spoke softly, stepping onto the altar.

"No problems!" Wan Lingkong transmitted to them. They all stepped onto the altar. Now, they could go anywhere.

"Buzz..." Upon seeing Luo Tian and his group step onto the teleportation array, Yan Hongtao activated it.

Teleportation energy acted on their bodies. Their figures instantly vanished from the cave, and as they left, the altar crumbled into dust, spreading across the cave.

After a while, Luo Tian and his group finally landed on solid ground. They appeared on the other side of the teleportation array, their faces filled with curiosity.

"Welcome to the Slaughter City!" Yan Hongtao's voice echoed in Luo Tian and his group's ears.

Luo Tian and his group stood on the teleportation array, their eyes scanning around immediately. Their hearts gave a slight jolt as they felt actual killing intent hidden in the void.

The teleportation array's surroundings were bustling with people. Each one wore blood-red robes, constantly stepping onto the teleportation array of the Slaughter City.

Some concealed their faces; others revealed them. However, everyone had a sense of killing intent about them.

"Respect the City Lord!" Upon seeing Yan Hongtao, people bowed slightly and greeted respectfully.

"Who are the ones following the City Lord? Why do they look so familiar?" Soon, people in the Slaughter City noticed Luo Tian and his group following Yan Hongtao.

"That's Luo Tian!" After a brief hesitation, someone recognized them.

Chapter 1576: Yan Haobo()

A wave of astonishment arose. Everyone's faces showed disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian standing beside Yan Hongtao.

Unlike people from other domains who felt reverence upon seeing Luo Tian, the Slaughter City people showed a sense of greed when they saw him. However, it was quickly suppressed.

"Rules remain the same. If anyone wants to assassinate him, they can still do so. After all, there's an employer!" Yan Hongtao smiled, addressing the people around him.

"Son of a bitch!" Upon hearing Yan Hongtao's words, Luo Tian mentally cursed. But he didn't take it too seriously. After all, his strength was there. Even Yan Hongtao, a killer, couldn't kill him. How could these Slaughter City people?

"Alright, let's go. Let me meet my father!" Yan Hongtao addressed Luo Tian and his group, not taking it too seriously. He had just been joking. Then he led Luo Tian and the others toward the central blood-colored palace of the Slaughter City.

"This is where I, my father, and people with status in the Slaughter City live!" Yan Hongtao introduced to Luo Tian and his group, then stepped into the palace.

Another wave of energy swept over them. The next moment, Luo Tian and his group felt as if they had entered another city. However, the energy here was much stronger than outside.

"A city within a city! You really have something!" Diao Dezhu and the others showed admiration.

"Let's go!" Yan Hongtao continued leading them. After walking for a while, he led Luo Tian and his group to an open courtyard.

"City Lord's Mansion!" Three big characters hung high outside the gate. Inside the courtyard, people were bustling about. However, it wasn't filled with killing intent but instead had maids and attendants walking around.

Luo Tian and his group walked through, feeling several powerful auras within the city. Their faces showed slight caution.

"Yan Hongtao, won't your people attack us?" Diao Dezhu and the others were uneasy, asking.

"Who knows? After all, a seed of an immortal herb is too tempting!" Yan Hongtao smiled.

"You... I should have known we wouldn't come. You're the City Lord, how can you not have any authority!" Upon hearing Yan Hongtao's answer, Diao Dezhu and the others immediately became discontent.

"Just a joke. Don't worry; no one will attack you with my presence!" Yan Hongtao shook his head lightly, leading them into the courtyard.

"Go meet my father. Then you can stay here and wait for my news!" Yan Hongtao led Luo Tian and his group, with the attendants' respectful gazes, into the depths of the courtyard.

"Father, Luo Tian and his group have arrived!" Yan Hongtao smiled, leading Luo Tian and his group to an unremarkable courtyard outside. Standing at the gate, he called into the courtyard.

"Ha! Luo Tian, I never expected you to come to the Slaughter Domain!" Before Yan Hongtao's words finished, Yan Xiuluo's aged figure stepped out of the courtyard. His eyes gazed at Luo Tian.

With a dragon-like stride and tiger's steps, Yan Xiuluo had not appeared for many years. Yet his cultivation hadn't declined at all. Though both were at the Chronological Peak, his aura was more stable and had no trace of previous killing intent.

"Respectful elder!" Luo Tian smiled slightly. He had a certain fondness for Yan Xiuluo, as he hadn't taken advantage of him when Luo Tian had single-handedly ascended the sacred mountain.

"Enough with the formalities. You wouldn't have come to the Slaughter Domain if there wasn't something!" Yan Xiuluo smiled. Now, Luo Tian had fully matured into a domain lord-level figure at the peak of his power. Yan Xiuluo no longer saw him as that naive youth.

"Dad, Luo Tian has entered the Slaughter Domain. He wants to find the Bone Forest. We came here to see if we could gather some information!" Yan Hongtao took over, explaining Luo Tian's purpose.

"The Bone Forest?" Upon hearing Yan Hongtao's words, Yan Xiuluo furrowed his brow and sighed deeply: "Let us activate our intelligence network to investigate!"

"Ah..." Upon hearing Yan Xiuluo's words, Luo Tian and his group showed disappointment. They hadn't expected Yan Xiuluo to not know how to find the Bone Forest.

"Don't worry. There must be traces, but we've never thoroughly pursued it before. Just stay here and wait. When I get news, I'll let Hongtao tell you!" Yan Xiuluo smiled, his aged eyes showing confidence.

"Then I'll trouble you, Elder!" Luo Tian bowed slightly. He knew that having the Slaughter Domain investigate was much better than waiting blindly!

Yan Hongtao first hosted a banquet for Luo Tian and his group, with the father and son personally accompanying them. After all, Luo Tian's current status was there.

The banquet was pleasant, and Luo Tian and his group were accommodated in the City Lord's Mansion. They waited for Yan Hongtao's news.
