“Moreover, it continues. Could this brat truly have mastered the Sword Array of the Destroying Heaven?” A wave of astonishment surged through their minds, yet a bitter sorrow lingered. They had lived countless years, deciphering the Sword Array of the Destroying Heaven multiple times.

As their strength grew, so did the intensity of the array they perceived. Thus, grasping its essence became increasingly arduous.

“I don’t believe it! How could this brat comprehend the Sword Array of the Destroying Heaven?” An elder spoke, his eyes fixated on Luo Tian moving through the array.

One... ten...

Time flowed slowly. Another quarter-hour passed, and Luo Tian had endured countless attacks. His body was filled with terrifying sword qi.

After paying the price, Luo Tian finally understood the three thousand six hundred positions of the Sword Array of the Destroying Heaven.

“This sword intent!” Luo Tian’s heart trembled, his entire body a bloodied mess. His being was saturated with sword intent, as if he had become a blade drawn from its sheath.

“Sword Realm!” A thunderous roar echoed, and Luo Tian seemed to undergo a transformation. The Reincarnation Realm expanded—but this time, it was not the spirit soul.

Chapter 2559: Defeating the Corpse King

A gray domain unfurled, a cacophony of souls wailing. Faces materialized around Luo Tian before shifting into countless gray spirit souls, transforming into myriad sword beams that drifted through his domain.

“What is this domain? Is it the Sword Realm?” The village elders’ faces bore disbelief. Among them were those who had wielded the Sword Realm before, yet this manifestation was unprecedented.

“Success!” Luo Tian’s heart surged with joy, sensing his domain had strengthened considerably.

“The next step is to unleash the sword qi!” Luo Tian held the broken sword Zhu Xian, repeatedly recalling the sword beam the figure had unleashed.

“Woo…” The sword intent roared to heaven, a towering blade凝聚 from Luo Tian’s hand. It clashed with another sword beam.

One... two...

Luo Tian continuously swung his long sword, but he encountered the same dilemma as before—unable to memorize the three thousand six hundred sword beams’ formations.

“Open!” At the fourth level of sword mastery, Luo Tian’s control over the sword qi had improved significantly. His body expelled the sword qi outward.

“Is he truly about to succeed? It’s been two hours already!” The village elders’ faces bore awe, watching Luo Tian still within the array.

Compared to before, Luo Tian’s condition had improved markedly. Though he was still pierced by sword qi, it no longer left him in disarray. However, Luo Tian had reached his limit; every part of his body was riddled with sword wounds.

“Does he not care about his life? He’s still persisting!” The healer spoke, his gaze filled with awe.

“Everyone, act! Bring him out!” The village elder could no longer watch. If this continued, Luo Tian would be flayed by the sword qi.

As the village elder’s words faded, five elders moved. Five beams of divine light shot from their hands into Luo Tian’s array.

Upon entering the array, these five beams of light attracted a swarm of sword qi, which rushed toward them.

Seizing the opportunity, the village elder’s aged body vanished from his spot, as if teleporting, and appeared beside Luo Tian. He seized the bloodied Luo Tian and pulled him out of the array.

“This brat, yet again wounded so severely!” The healer shook his head and retrieved a mortar, grinding herbs continuously.

A torrent of medicinal herbs was crushed and applied to Luo Tian’s body. He transformed into a man wrapped in medicine, leaving only his eyes visible—eyes filled with excitement.

“Da Niu and Er Niu, take him down. Once his wounds heal, the two of you will follow him out. Remember to learn more; outsiders are all villains. For instance, this brat is certainly no good!”

“Still, you two must obey this brat. If danger arises at critical moments, fight if you can; flee if not. Don’t worry about this brat—he’s cunning and won’t die!” The five elders spoke in turn, giving instructions to Da Niu and Er Niu.

The two youths carried Luo Tian back to the village elder’s courtyard. Hearing the old men’s words, Luo Tian inwardly rolled his eyes but his gaze held excitement.

Though he had not fully mastered the Sword Array of the Destroying Heaven, Luo Tian could now wield a portion of its power. He had memorized six hundred sword beams’ movements, enabling him to unleash part of its might.

“From now on, I must rely solely on my own deductions!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. He had decided to leave the Spirit and Ghost Marsh, as he had spent too long within it.

After spending years in the space devoured by Xing Tian and other periods, Luo Tian had remained in the Spirit and Ghost Marsh for eight years.

Moreover, he had not seen Fu Xingxuan here. Going deeper was something even the village elders dared not do, let alone him.

Even if he wished to find Fu Xingxuan, Luo Tian would have to wait until after exiting the marsh and then re-enter from another direction.

“This Spirit and Ghost Marsh is truly dangerous!” Luo Tian’s heart sighed, acknowledging the marsh’s danger exceeded all he had encountered. If not for his luck, countless lives would have been lost.

Time flowed slowly. Seven days passed. Luo Tian’s medicinal herbs had dried, and his wounds were nearly healed—though scars remained, they no longer hindered his strength.

Outside the Spirit Hiding Village, Luo Tian bowed respectfully to the five elders: “Thank you for your care these past days. I will ensure Da Niu and Er Niu are well looked after!”

“Go, we’ll see you off. That corpse king is still a threat!” The village elder nodded slightly. Five elders followed Luo Tian as they headed toward the black forest.

Luo Tian’s heart surged with excitement. Previously, he had been chased like a desperate dog by the Corpse King; now, with five old men backing him, he could return to avenge himself.

Eight people soon reached the forest’s edge. Da Niu and Er Niu’s faces bore excitement, like curious children—this was their first time leaving.

They walked through the mountains for a quarter-hour until they reached the row of coffins.

Yet this time, the coffins remained still, tightly sealed. Luo Tian was puzzled.

“Elders, it was that man who chased me relentlessly. The other half of the Zhu Xian Sword is also in his possession!” Luo Tian addressed the village elder.

“Corpse King, come out!” Luo Tian leapt onto a coffin and shouted toward the central one.

“Is he hiding like a turtle? Ha!” Luo Tian heard no response and cursed.

Inside the massive coffin, the Corpse King lay, cursing inwardly. Recently, he had chased Luo Tian and seen Seven Absolute Sect’s statue, which terrified him.

Back then, the Seven Absolute Sect had been a great power. The entire world knew of his fame, and he was a pillar in the Heavenly Court.

But he had been merely a lowly thug under Xing Tian. The Seven Absolute Sect had aimed to slay Xing Tian but accidentally killed him, and he was merely unlucky—struck by the tip of Zhu Xian Sword. The two were too far apart.

A statue had terrified the Corpse King to such an extent that he fled, remaining cautious. He never expected there would be something related to the Seven Absolute Sect here.

“Come out! You said you wanted to kill me, didn’t you? Little thug, a corpse—today I’ll burn you!” Luo Tian cursed, his hands swirling with ten-colored flames that surged toward the Corpse King’s coffin.

“I won’t come out. What can you do to me?” Though the Corpse King was inside his coffin, he sensed the five elders’ immense power. Each of them was no less than himself.

The ten-colored flames swept over the coffin but only scorched its surface, causing no real damage.

“This coffin is no ordinary thing!” The village elder’s brow furrowed slightly. He leapt into the air, and the five elders approached the Corpse King’s coffin.

“Elders, can you open it? This is a threat we cannot leave!” Luo Tian addressed the village elders.

“Corpse King, stop pretending to be dead. If you don’t come out, we’ll pry open your coffin!” Luo Tian shouted again, his blood-red sword appearing in hand. He slashed at the coffin with a fierce swing.

Crack! The blood sword left an imprint on the coffin’s surface, and Luo Tian was sent flying backward.

“Damn… what kind of coffin is this?” Luo Tian was stunned, wiping blood from his lips. He hadn’t expected the coffin to be so tough.

“This is what he treasures most!” Luo Tian muttered, his gaze turning toward the five elders.

“Fight! If you can open this coffin, I’ll admit defeat!” The Corpse King sneered. He knew the coffin’s power was beyond what Luo Tian and his group could break, so he felt absolutely safe within it.

“I’ll try!” One elder’s eyes widened with surprise. He kicked toward the coffin with a powerful leg.

“Woo…”

The wind from his kick could have killed an early-stage Immortal King, even a mid-stage one. Luo Tian’s face bore shock.

“Boom…”

The next moment, a thunderous sound echoed as the elder’s leg slammed into the massive coffin. The enormous casket was kicked away by his force.

Boom, boom, boom…

The massive coffin collided with smaller ones, shattering them. The zombies inside also crumbled. However, the Corpse King’s coffin merely flew out ten zhang before landing on the ground.

“Hmph, what in the world is this thing?” The healer and others bore astonishment. They knew the power of that kick but hadn’t expected it to have no effect on the coffin.

“Let’s all attack together!” The village elder frowned, brandishing a long sword that radiated brilliant divine light. He slashed toward the coffin with an overwhelming sword intent.

The other four also unleashed their attacks, four formidable blows that shook the entire forest. The overwhelming pressure made Luo Tian’s heart tremble.

“Is this the strength of the Spirit Hiding Village?” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, watching each attack capable of ending him strike the coffin.

Boom, boom, boom…

The thunderous sound echoed through heaven and earth. Invisible power swept across the land, shattering coffins into dust that scattered in the air.

“This is terrifying!” Luo Tian watched the five elders’ attacks, sighing inwardly. Their combined strength was more than enough to deal with the Black and White Judges.

As the dust settled, Luo Tian was stunned. The Corpse King’s coffin still lay there, its surface merely rippling with faint Daoic patterns.

“What in the world is this coffin?” Luo Tian’s jaw dropped, staring at the unassuming coffin.

Though the coffin remained untouched, the Corpse King inside was not faring well. His towering body trembled violently, his skin riddled with cracks, and yellowish thick liquid oozed out.

“We truly can’t deal with him. Healer, the two of you carry this fellow to the village. I won’t let him escape!” The village elder spoke softly. The healer and another elder who had previously tested Da Niu and Er Niu lifted the coffin toward the Spirit Hiding Village. Luo Tian and the others continued heading toward the edge of the Spirit and Ghost Marsh.

Chapter 2560: Leaving the Spirit and Ghost Marsh

The group exited the marsh, continuing toward the icy plains. Only the village elder and two other elders remained.

“This place was once sealed by our ancestors with a powerful being!” The village elder spoke, gazing at the vast icy plain. Though they hadn’t experienced that era, their lineage was complete, and every event was recorded.

“Yin Xuanbing once dominated a region. Our ancestors sealed him, and it was this very seal that saved Yin Xuanbing’s life, allowing him to survive until now!” The village elder spoke, his eyes filled with nostalgia. Some things were truly unpredictable.

Fate and fortune—each felt the sigh of destiny as they walked across the icy plain. Passing by Yin Xuanbing’s ice mountain, they exchanged glances with him.

“Is he a descendant of that man? I can sense your bloodline!” Yin Xuanbing’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears.

“Can’t move. The seal by our ancestors is too strong. Even after so many years, breaking it completely is impossible. Moreover, our ancestors chose to seal him without killing him—there must have been a reason!” The village elder shook his head gently, not intending to confront Yin Xuanbing.

Since the village elders did not attack Yin Xuanbing, he dared not retaliate. He had no chance of victory; it was like an egg against a stone.

Luo Tian said nothing, as Yin Xuanbing had previously shielded him from the Corpse King’s attack—though it was unintentional.

The group traversed the icy plain and entered a desolate city, spending half a month on the journey.

Black mist appeared in Luo Tian’s vision. A damp atmosphere filled the air. Finally, he saw the marshland he had crossed before. If he could exit this marsh, he would be free.

Unforgettable—Luo Tian could only use these four words to describe this journey through the Spirit and Ghost Marsh. Surviving was purely due to luck.

“Da Niu, Er Niu, try flying and see. This marsh has a binding effect on us!” The village elder addressed Da Niu and Er Niu.

“Got it!” Excited, Da Niu and Er Niu leapt into the air toward the marsh.

They were instantly suppressed to five hundred zhang in height, their faces filled with curiosity as they looked back at the village elders.

“Good!” Seeing no harm to them, the three elders bore surprise. They hadn’t expected Da Niu and Er Niu to be unaffected by the binding.

“We can only escort you this far. Da Niu and Er Niu are now under your care!” The village elder addressed Luo Tian.

“Elders, I will do my best!” Luo Tian bowed to the three elders, his eyes filled with gratitude.

“Elder…” Da Niu and Er Niu returned, kneeling three times before the village elders.

“Go. Young eagles must eventually fly out. Remember what we told you two—once outside, obey Luo Tian!” The village elder reiterated, his face more aged.

“Elders, farewell!” Luo Tian leapt into the air with Da Niu and Er Niu, flying toward the marsh.

Watching Luo Tian’s group depart, the three elders seemed even older, their gazes filled with sorrow.

“This parting—whether we’ll meet again is unknown!”

“Yes, it’s truly just us old men left!” The three elders’ gazes bore sorrow.

“Let’s go back!” The three elders, hunched over, turned toward the Spirit Hiding Village.

Loneliness awaited them. The three elders knew their fate was to die in the Spirit Hiding Village.

For countless years, five old men had watched many villagers pass away. They did not want Da Niu and Er Niu to suffer the same fate, so they had sent them with Luo Tian.

...

Luo Tian and his companions maintained a height of five hundred zhang, flying over the marsh. Luo Tian’s face bore caution; he hadn’t spotted the massive crocodile or its horde.

Yet, Luo Tian remained vigilant. Though he was nearly out, one day outside meant he could not relax.

“Big Brother Tian, what good food is there outside… Big Brother, are all people as strong as you?” Two days after leaving the Spirit Hiding Village, Da Niu and Er Niu’s initial sadness faded. They became lively, constantly asking Luo Tian questions.

Luo Tian felt his head throb; these two boys asked everything, leaving him unsure how to respond.

Time flowed slowly. The three flew calmly, Luo Tian following the route he remembered toward the marsh’s edge.

What puzzled Luo Tian was that after several days in the marsh, they encountered nothing. The entire marsh was unusually quiet.

“Did I get lost again?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, observing the surroundings. He moved toward where pressure was lighter, as before.

“Woo…”

As Luo Tian and his companions flew for seven days, waves of energy appeared in Luo Tian’s perception. The black mist trembled; he sensed several figures approaching from his direction.

“Such a strong aura!” Luo Tian’s heart tensed. Though the figures were far away, their presence caused the black mist to tremble.

“Da Niu, Er Niu, conceal your forms!” Luo Tian ordered the two. His spiritual awareness covered all three, instantly concealing their figures.

For a moment of incense, three figures appeared in Luo Tian’s view.

Black robes obscured their faces. What stunned Luo Tian was that these three were not flying at five hundred zhang but walking, the marsh frozen. They walked across the ice.

“Who are these people?” Luo Tian wondered. Their auras were extremely strong, even making him sense an Immortal King peak aura.

Luo Tian secretly activated his Lei Yang Eye, gazing at the three. Upon seeing their faces, his expression changed instantly.

“Huang Tian’s Grand Master!” Luo Tian almost gasped. He recognized the imposing elder leading them.

“Why is Huang Tian’s Grand Master here in the Spirit and Ghost Marsh at this time?” Luo Tian felt puzzled.

As he pondered, Huang Tian’s Grand Master and his two subordinates stopped. Their gazes bore curiosity as they scanned the surroundings.

“I feel someone is watching us,” Huang Tian’s Grand Master spoke, carefully observing before shaking his head.

Hearing Huang Tian’s Grand Master’s words, Luo Tian quickly deactivated his Lei Yang Eye and signaled Da Niu and Er Niu to stay still.

“Let’s go!” As Luo Tian deactivated his eye, Huang Tian’s Grand Master spoke softly and led his two subordinates deeper into the marsh.

Luo Tian and his companions held their breath, concealing themselves until the ice melted before revealing their forms.

“Why is Huang Tian’s Grand Master here? Also, his attire isn’t that of Huang Tian!” Luo Tian felt puzzled. He didn’t understand why Huang Tian’s Grand Master had appeared here.

But these matters weren’t for Luo Tian to ponder. These were the affairs of high-ranking figures; right now, he only wanted to exit and escape from the Spirit and Ghost Marsh.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian ordered Da Niu and Er Niu, leaping into the air toward the marsh’s edge.

After seven days of flight, Luo Tian encountered no danger. The three finally reached the marsh’s shore, and Luo Tian let out a long sigh.

Luo Tian felt relieved. If he had met the crocodile horde, it would have been troublesome.

“Slight deviation in position, but no problem!” Luo Tian’s face bore a slight smile. He looked toward the distance, knowing his location.

“Let’s return to the Turn Wheel Temple first. Then I’ll show you around!” Luo Tian addressed Da Niu and Er Niu, leaping into the air with them. They became three streaks of light toward the Turn Wheel Temple.

After a day’s flight, Luo Tian and his companions passed by the Spirit and Ghost King City. Luo Tian led Da Niu and Er Niu to descend into the city, wanting to inquire if Mo Tian had returned.

“Hmm?” As Luo Tian entered the Spirit and Ghost King City, he sensed a change. The city was no longer as prosperous as before; even the ghostly qi wasn’t as thick.

“What happened?” Luo Tian’s heart trembled. He had been away for eight years, and it seemed something had changed in Hell.

Da Niu and Er Niu were very excited. They wandered around the city, their faces filled with curiosity—everything was new to them.

Luo Tian didn’t interfere with the two boys. These two were Immortal King early-stage masters, capable of walking unchallenged in Hell. Plus, he had a connection with Mo Tian and wasn’t worried about anything.

Luo Tian quickly reached the city’s palace. The sight of it was completely different from before—brand new, as if rebuilt.

“Please inform the Spirit and Ghost King that Luo Tian wishes to pay his respects!” Luo Tian straightened his posture as he addressed the two guards at the gate.

“Spirit and Ghost King? There is no such thing anymore!” One guard sneered, looking at Luo Tian as if he were a barbarian. Everyone knew the Spirit and Ghost King City was gone now.

“What’s going on?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, emitting a wave of pressure. He looked at the two guards.

“Immortal King!” Sensing Luo Tian’s pressure, the two guards trembled instantly.

“M… Master, eight years ago, the Spirit and Ghost King City was destroyed. Now it’s no longer the Spirit and Ghost King City; the Spirit and Ghost King has been gone for six years!”

“Now our city’s ruler is Shen Gong Tu!” The two guards stammered, recounting what they knew.

“Then go in and tell him that the Turn Wheel Temple’s Grand Disciple Luo Tian has come to pay his respects!” Luo Tian spoke softly, feeling he had missed much during these eight years. Also, Mo Tian had returned but disappeared again—this was suspicious.

“Turn Wheel Temple’s Grand Disciple!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the two guards didn’t dare to delay. They hurried into the city palace.

Chapter 2561: Shen Gong Tu

The Spirit and Ghost King City had once been prosperous, but now it was weak. The entire lineage of the Spirit and Ghost King had been wiped out overnight. Old Spirit and Ghost King Mo Du had taken the city’s strength away, disappearing without a trace. The new Spirit and Ghost King returned five years later but vanished again.

No one knew where he was. Now the Spirit and Ghost King City had changed hands. Three years ago, a powerful figure arrived, rebuilding it. The city was renamed Yongyang City!

Yongyang City’s ruler, Shen Gong Tu, was ruthless. In three years, he had restored peace to Yongyang City. Though it wasn’t as renowned as the Eight Heavenly Kings’ Cities, it had gained some fame.

As for who Shen Gong Tu was and where he came from, no one knew. However, in three years, he had seized control of the Spirit and Ghost King City—this alone indicated Shen Gong Tu was no ordinary person.

At this moment, in the newly renamed Yongyang City’s palace, a middle-aged man sat calmly. His aura was steady, with several attendants by his side. He had a thick beard, giving him a rugged appearance.

“Report, Grand Disciple of the Turn Wheel Temple is requesting an audience outside!” A young man rushed in, bowing to Shen Gong Tu.

“Who?” Hearing the report, Shen Gong Tu straightened his posture. He looked at the young man.

“Grand Disciple of the Turn Wheel Temple?” Shen Gong Tu’s eyes darkened, as if pondering something. He took out a token and transmitted his thoughts to it before rising and heading toward the palace’s entrance.

Soon, Shen Gong Tu reached the palace’s entrance and saw Luo Tian waiting there.

“Respectful greetings to Grand Disciple of the Turn Wheel Temple. I regret my absence in welcoming you. Please forgive me!” Shen Gong Tu greeted Luo Tian, his face smiling.

“Hm.” Luo Tian’s expression was neutral. He observed Shen Gong Tu, his heart slightly startled.

“This is a person of note!” Luo Tian thought to himself. He looked at Shen Gong Tu, whose beard was thick but eyes sharp.

During his wait, Luo Tian had spoken with the two guards at the palace and learned some of Shen Gong Tu’s past.

“Grand Disciple, please come in!” Shen Gong Tu smiled and invited Luo Tian into the palace.

“Apologies for the intrusion!” Luo Tian smiled but felt some unease, glancing at the palace.

“There’s a sense of danger!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed slightly but he didn’t dwell on it. After all, this was Hell, not the Spirit and Ghost Marsh.

Both men smiled, exchanging polite words as they entered the palace. Shen Gong Tu had already ordered his subordinates to prepare a banquet.

“Grand Disciple, what brings you to Yongyang City? Is there anything I can assist with?” Shen Gong Tu smiled, addressing Luo Tian as “Grand Disciple” repeatedly to elevate his status.

“I have no specific matter. I just wish to inquire about Mo Tian’s whereabouts!” Luo Tian replied, causing Shen Gong Tu to slightly frown. After all, this place was once the Spirit and Ghost King’s domain.

“Grand Disciple, I truly don’t know. I arrived here three years ago!” Shen Gong Tu replied.

“Ah?”

“If that’s the case, then I’ll take my leave. I have other matters to attend to!” Luo Tian smiled slightly and rose, heading toward the room’s exit.

“Grand Disciple, why leave so soon? This is your first visit to Yongyang City. At least let me show my hospitality as a host!” Shen Gong Tu quickly rose, positioning himself just right—blocking Luo Tian’s exit but leaving space. If Luo Tian forced his way out, he could.

“I must go. The Grand Master has assigned me an important task. If I delay, he’ll be angry!” Luo Tian maintained his smile.

Hearing Luo Tian mention the Black and White Judges, Shen Gong Tu’s expression slightly paused. He moved aside to let Luo Tian pass.

“Then I won’t detain Grand Disciple any longer!” Shen Gong Tu didn’t continue to escort Luo Tian but watched him leave the palace before entering it himself.

As soon as he entered, Shen Gong Tu’s face darkened. He quickly retreated to his bedroom and waved his hand, covering himself in a black robe. The sleeve of the robe bore a crescent moon.

Shen Gong Tu’s body flickered, vanishing from his room like a ghost. He flew out of the palace toward Luo Tian’s direction.

“Da Niu, Er Niu, gather at the city gate quickly!” Luo Tian’s face darkened as he transmitted to Da Niu and Er Niu.

“This Shen Gong Tu is suspicious!” Luo Tian thought. Though their conversation was brief, he sensed a killing intent from Shen Gong Tu—though faint, it was clear to him.

Luo Tian and Shen Gong Tu had only met once. Luo Tian was the Grand Disciple of the Turn Wheel Temple, and Shen Gong Tu still dared to have a killing intent. This was worth pondering.

People in Hell couldn’t be judged by common sense; murder and theft were common. Thus, Luo Tian didn’t want to stay in the palace any longer—this was Shen Gong Tu’s stronghold.

Luo Tian flickered, appearing outside the city gate immediately. He waited for Da Niu and Er Niu to emerge.

“Just a Shen Gong Tu, not too scary. I wonder who’s behind him—there must be someone!” Luo Tian waited and pondered.

Boom…

As Luo Tian waited, a thunderous sound echoed through the city. A streak of light shot into the sky.

“Brat, you drank our tea and slept with our girls. You think you can leave without paying?” A furious voice echoed.

“We didn’t!” An angry voice replied, like a thunderous rumble. Luo Tian was momentarily stunned—this voice was clearly Da Niu and Er Niu’s.

Luo Tian flickered, returning to the city. He appeared at the scene and saw Da Niu and Er Niu.

“Big Brother!” Da Niu and Er Niu rushed to Luo Tian’s side. Around them lay numerous figures, groaning.

“What happened?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He naturally knew what “Xuan Yue Building” was.

“We were wandering around the city and passed by here. They forcibly pulled us in, saying they wanted to treat us to tea…” Da Niu spoke continuously, recounting the incident.

“Riffraff! You ate and slept for free and now want to leave?” As Da Niu spoke, a figure appeared. His aura was fierce, his eyes glowing with menace.

The man was a middle-aged man wearing an embroidered robe. His eyes were like wolves, and the most noticeable feature was a scar running from his eye to his jaw.

“Master Zhu, you must protect our girls!” Upon seeing the middle-aged man arrive, the brothel owner immediately felt a sense of security.

Zhu Wanli, the boss of Xuan Yue Building. Zhu Wanli’s other identity was a bandit from the Heavenly Mountain, with power just short of an Immortal King. No one dared to provoke him; his subordinates were also strong.

With the Spirit and Ghost King City destroyed, Zhu Wanli knew his opportunity had come. He didn’t want to be a bandit forever and thus chose to settle in the Spirit and Ghost King City, becoming one of its major families. Xuan Yue Building was one of his businesses. He often visited to find entertainment.

“This time, these three brats are in trouble!” People murmured. They knew who Zhu Wanli was and understood the methods of Xuan Yue Building—polite invitations to enter, but leaving would be difficult.

“How much?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He didn’t want to argue but wanted to leave this city quickly with the group.

“Those two brats were very energetic. They slept with over two hundred girls. We won’t ask for much—just leave your sword behind!” Zhu Wanli smiled, looking at the blood sword on Luo Tian’s back.

“Two hundred…” Hearing Zhu Wanli’s words, Luo Tian guessed that Da Niu and Er Niu had been tricked. These two boys were simple-minded, with no experience—like blank sheets.

“Here’s your sword!” Luo Tian sneered and took off the blood sword, slashing it toward Zhu Wanli.

Plop…

Everyone’s eyes flickered. A mist of blood appeared in their vision. Zhu Wanli fell to the ground, his leg missing.

“Da Niu and Er Niu, this is how the outside world works. When others bully you, fight back until they dare not bully you again. This is the first lesson I taught you!” Luo Tian addressed Da Niu and Er Niu, not even looking at Zhu Wanli. He turned toward the city gate.

“Hmph, okay!” Da Niu nodded slightly, understanding. He took a step forward, his aura radiating outward. He approached the trembling brothel owner.

“Smack!” Da Niu slapped her, sending her flying. Her teeth fell out.

“Next time, don’t deceive us. You’re too bad!” Da Niu spoke, his voice still simple.

“Immortal King! Definitely an Immortal King!” People murmured. They watched Luo Tian’s group leave and also saw Zhu Wanli missing a leg and the brothel owner.

This incident was trivial for Luo Tian. Even if Da Niu and Er Niu had truly found girls, it wasn’t a big deal to him.

However, this delay caused Luo Tian’s group to leave later than planned.

After exiting the city gate, Luo Tian led them toward the Turn Wheel Temple. After a while, Luo Tian suddenly felt a wave of anxiety.

“Big Brother Tian, what’s wrong?” Da Niu and Er Niu asked, confused. They saw Luo Tian stop and looked at him.

“We’ve been followed!” Luo Tian’s gaze swept the surroundings. They were in a mountainous area, and to reach the Turn Wheel Temple, this was the only path. On both sides were low hills. Crossing them would be straightforward; taking a detour would be much longer.

Chapter 2562: Returning to the Turn Wheel Temple

As Luo Tian’s words finished, waves of energy echoed from the surrounding hills, enveloping Luo Tian and Da Niu and Er Niu.

Five figures appeared around them, their auras fierce. Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly.

Black robes obscured their faces. What surprised Luo Tian was that these five wore the same attire as Huang Tian’s Grand Master had in the Spirit and Ghost Marsh.

“Shen Tu, you’ve come again so soon to see me?”

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with golden patterns. He looked at a figure in black robes. Though his face was obscured, Luo Tian’s Lei Yang Eye recognized Shen Gong Tu.

Recognized by Luo Tian, Shen Gong Tu hesitated slightly. The black mist dispersed, revealing his grim face.

“Who are you?” Luo Tian spoke softly. He felt these people were part of a formidable force, and he suspected Huang Tian’s Grand Master might be one of them.

“You don’t need to know who we are. What matters is that you stay here today!” Shen Gong Tu’s face was grim. According to their rules, he couldn’t be recognized; if he were, he would face punishment.

“Since when have Immortal Kings become so cheap?” Luo Tian thought. He hadn’t expected five Immortal Kings to appear at once.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian pondered, a thunderous sound fell from the sky. A lightning attack descended, imbued with heavenly authority, striking Luo Tian.

“Ah! It was a temporary enhancement via an array to reach early-stage Immortal King!” Luo Tian slightly startled, understanding. He wore a sneer.

“Da Niu and Er Niu, let me test your strength. These people are for you to handle!” Luo Tian addressed Da Niu and Er Niu.
