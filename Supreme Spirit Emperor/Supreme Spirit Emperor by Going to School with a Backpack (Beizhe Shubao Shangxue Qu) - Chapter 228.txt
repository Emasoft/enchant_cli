The crowd sighed for a long time before finally regaining their composure, directing their gazes toward Luo Tian, who stood bewildered.

"It's you!" The elder's face bore a trace of satisfaction; the essence blood of the Cyclic Body had left both him and the three subordinate spirit-essences thoroughly pleased.

Luo Tian too recovered from his shock, guiding the golden essence blood toward the half-body within the jade coffin.

"You need not worry about losing your essence blood," the elder addressed Zhou Wei and the others. "It will certainly not leave you at a disadvantage—any of the medicinal herbs within the Celestial Silkworm Jade Coffin may be taken freely, their worth sufficient to offset the value of your single drop of essence blood."

Yet Zhou Wei and the others seemed deaf, their eyes fixed on the half-body absorbing the golden essence blood.

"Buzz..." The golden essence blood surged into the half-body, amplifying its oppressive aura. The surrounding medicinal herbs trembled under invisible waves.

Though Luo Tian's essence blood was formidable, it stirred no ripples upon entering the body; it remained lifeless, in stark contrast to the vibrant vitality of the surrounding herbs.

"Ah..." Zhou Wei and Feng Jiutian exhaled long, weary breaths. Failure meant the ancient palace would remain leaderless. They would return to their clan and inform the saintly tribe's powerhouses to attempt retrieval using epoch relics.

"It's not enough!" The elder's expression darkened as he addressed Luo Tian, clearly unwilling to concede. "Continue supplying the essence blood."

"Alright," Luo Tian replied without hesitation, extending his hand to release three more drops of essence blood. His face paled further.

"Hmph, is the Epoch Lord so easily awakened?" Feng Jiutian mused coldly, his gaze on Luo Tian's three essence blood droplets. He felt both mockery and exhilaration.

Three drops of essence blood could wound Luo Tian's core, leaving him unable to recover for some time.

Yet even after the three drops entered Meng Lingyun's half-body, no signs of life emerged. The primary spirit-essence's expression shifted slightly.

"It's not enough! Give three more drops—though it fails, I'll find a way to compensate you!" The primary spirit-essence spoke resolutely.

Luo Tian gritted his teeth, resolve hardening in his eyes—not for the compensation but because of Meng Lingyun's presence within the Epoch Book. He knew this gamble was worth it.

Three drops of essence blood hummed as Luo Tian's face turned pale, his core wounded.

The three drops merged into Meng Lingyun's half-body, yet still no life stirred. The primary and three subordinate spirit-essences' eyes flickered with despair, their murmurs barely audible: "It still won't work. Even the strongest body's essence blood fails... How can we awaken him?"

"Again!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed violet as he extended his hand, releasing three more drops into Meng Lingyun's half-body.

"Idiot! Even the spirit-essences said it wouldn't work—go on, exhaust yourself!" Feng Jiutian sneered inwardly, watching Luo Tian's relentless determination.

Nine drops of essence blood left Luo Tian near death, yet his eyes gleamed with a hint of joy. He had glimpsed the truth: the ten drops of essence blood he'd unleashed now flowed through Meng Lingyun's vast meridians, seeping into his long-dormant heart. A faint, imperceptible spark of life flickered across Meng Lingyun's form—unnoticed by the four spirit-essences, but not by Luo Tian's violet eyes.

"Ten drops—enough. Your essence blood is exhausted," the spirit-essence murmured, shaking his head. Though he doubted Luo Tian's success, he was moved by the young man's persistence.

Luo Tian, weakened to the brink, sweat dripped from his face as he clung to resolve.

"Buzz..." His mind's eye stirred, and Meng Lingyun's soul fragment emerged from the Epoch Book, gratitude etched on its face.

"I still have essence blood to give!" Luo Tian roared, striking his chest with a fist.

"Boom..." A low sound echoed through Luo Tian's body, and a single drop of essence blood erupted from his mouth. The overwhelming aura left everyone stunned—far surpassing the previous drops.

"Saint's heart blood! Luo Tian is risking his life!" Zhou Wei and Sun Mengru marveled, baffled by Luo Tian's desperation.

"Saint's heart blood—only three drops exist. To exhaust all three means the saint's core is spent, and he'll need most of his time to recover. If he dies, it's over!" Feng Jiutian's joy was unrestrained; he'd never expected Luo Tian to resort to saint's heart blood.

"Kid, it's no use! Give up! Take back your heart blood, and I'll grant you this ancient palace as a sanctuary for you and your kin. You may enter anytime," the primary spirit-essence spoke gently, his voice tinged with emotion.

"Let me try!" Luo Tian grabbed a medicinal herb from the jade coffin, cramming it into his mouth to chew. He seemed to be regaining strength.

"Boom..." Luo Tian struck his chest again, coughing up another golden drop of blood. His body swayed perilously on the jade coffin; had Long Jie not caught him, he would have fallen into the Celestial Silkworm Jade Coffin.

Chapter 999: Master and Servant ()

In the ancient palace beneath the stars, Luo Tian's face was pale. Before him floated two drops of golden saint's heart blood—two radiant suns illuminating the cosmos.

Saint's heart blood, the most precious essence of a saintly realm, lay deep within the heart. Its value was incalculable; if a transcendent power obtained and refined it, their cultivation would surge, potentially breaking through to the early saintly realm.

To exhaust three drops of heart blood meant a saint's core was spent, requiring most of their time to recover. In extreme cases, the saint might perish from core depletion.

"Is it worth this?" Sun Mengru sighed softly, gazing at Luo Tian.

The four spirit-essences bore expressions of admiration and emotion. Few could match Luo Tian's resolve; this was a gamble with life itself. Though he had one drop left, the core depletion was immeasurable.

Luo Tian's eyes burned with determination. Though uncertain of success, he deemed the risk worth it. If successful, the Four Saintly Domains' Fire Domain would gain a foundation; if not, the primary spirit-essence's words ensured the ancient palace would become his kin's sanctuary.

He wasn't certain if he could break the Dao's suppression, but he felt their impending battle would be fierce. With his early saintly realm cultivation, could he protect his kin? This ancient palace would be his last defense.

Plus, Meng Lingyun had aided him; reviving even a half-body would be a great asset. The Epoch Lord could not be insulted; without epoch-level strength, Meng Lingyun's body would remain unscathed.

"It's worth it!" Luo Tian formed hand seals, infusing the two golden drops into Meng Lingyun's half-body.

"Buzz..." A hum resonated from Meng Lingyun's body as the two drops transformed into golden dragons, weaving through his form before converging on his withered heart.

"Failed?" The four spirit-essences bore disappointment, their despair deepened by the failure to awaken even a Cyclic Body's heart blood.

"Ha! You've lost both your wife and your life, haven't you?" Feng Jiutian's joy was palpable, though he dared not mock aloud. His mind seethed with contempt for Luo Tian's folly.

"Alas..." Zhou Wei and Sun Mengru sighed, pitying Luo Tian.

Long Jie supported Luo Tian, summoning a roar as three drops of dragon essence blood surged from his palm into Luo Tian's body. The two, bound by blood ties, felt no resistance; the three drops flowed through Luo Tian's meridians, instantly revitalizing him. Yet Long Jie's face paled.

"A touching brotherly bond!" The three subordinate spirit-essences marveled, watching Luo Tian and Long Jie stand together.

Luo Tian's eyes still flashed violet lightning, his gaze fixed on Meng Lingyun's half-body.

The primary spirit-essence sighed deeply, summoning four sacred herbs from the Celestial Silkworm Jade Coffin. They landed in Sun Mengru, Zhou Wei, and Feng Jiutian's hands.

Feng Jiutian smiled in satisfaction; though he'd lost a drop of essence blood, the herbs' value easily offset it. He also had his plans—after exiting the ancient palace, he'd inform the demon domain's secluded powerhouses to retrieve the relic and claim the ancient palace. If he could obtain Meng Lingyun's finger, forging it into a pseudo-epoch relic would be within reach.

Zhou Wei and Sun Mengru exchanged glances, their thoughts unreadable.

"Boom..." Just as hope seemed lost, a heavy sound echoed through the cosmos, shaking it. The thunderous noise felt like a lightning strike in their ears, drawing all eyes to Meng Lingyun's half-body.

Golden light flowed from his heart, gradually enveloping his body.

"There's hope!" The four spirit-essences' faces lit with boundless excitement, their eyes fixed on Meng Lingyun's body as they spoke in trembling voices.

Feng Jiutian watched the golden light, his heart lurching—Luo Tian had truly succeeded.

The golden light flowed for a full hour before fading, and the cosmos stilled. Meng Lingyun's half-body stood revealed, restored to its original state.

"Nothing changed!" Feng Jiutian exclaimed joyfully, his voice trembling with excitement.

"Alas..." The four spirit-essences sighed again, gazing at Luo Tian before speaking softly: "It failed. Still, thank you! From now on, you are our friend. This ancient palace welcomes you anytime!"

The primary spirit-essence extended his hand, a weathered token appearing in Luo Tian's grasp. "This palace seal is yours. With it, you may open the ancient palace. When in need, you'll sense its location!"

"Among the herbs in this Celestial Silkworm Jade Coffin, you may take any except the medicinal king. It's for your survival," the primary spirit-essence said, his voice weary yet concealing a flicker of joy.

Luo Tian's lips curled slightly as he accepted the token, plucking three sacred herbs and bowing to the spirit-essence.

"Respected elder, I have something private to say—may I?" Luo Tian addressed the spirit-essence, his gaze flicking toward Feng Jiutian, Zhou Wei, even Sun Mengru and the three subordinate spirit-essences.

"Hmm?" The primary spirit-essence furrowed his brow, puzzled by Luo Tian's intent. Yet recalling his desperation, he waved a hand, teleporting Sun Mengru, Feng Jiutian, and Zhou Wei back to the previous hall.

The three spirit-essences discreetly vanished into the cosmos, leaving only Luo Tian, Long Jie, and the primary spirit-essence alongside the vast Celestial Silkworm Jade Coffin.

"Speak," the elder said, shaking his head. "If it's not too much, I'll grant your request. Of course, if you ask me to break the Dao's suppression, I can't."

"Respected elder overestimates," Luo Tian smiled, loosening Long Jie's support. He stood beneath the stars, his hands emitting strange waves.

"Come out!" Luo Tian roared, and golden light erupted across the cosmos. His mind's eye surged with terrifying waves, colliding against the golden Epoch Book.

The golden light illuminated the cosmos again as the Epoch Book slowly emerged from Luo Tian's mind, leaving the primary spirit-essence stunned.

"What... is this?" The spirit-essence's voice trembled, his eyes wide with shock.

"How do you possess the Epoch Book? When your master fell, it was scattered! Yet this one is nearly complete. How did you achieve it?" The spirit-essence's voice shook; he knew who possessed the Epoch Book would have infinite potential to become an Epoch Lord. His master, Meng Lingyun, had achieved that very status.

"As for how I did it, elder need not inquire. I'm not here to show you the Epoch Book but to reveal a soul fragment!" Luo Tian smiled, bowing respectfully toward the book.

"Master Meng, no one else is here. Won't you emerge? I'm sure your body suits you better!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice respectful.

"Buzz..." A titanic aura surged from the primary spirit-essence, his body trembling as he listened. His eyes locked onto Luo Tian before a glimmer of hope flickered across his face, gazing at the Epoch Book in the cosmos.

Long Jie stood beside Luo Tian, his face awestruck and expectant. He hadn't known Luo Tian harbored such a secret—hiding an epoch lord, an invincible being for a million years. Who wouldn't wish to witness such a figure?

"Kid, do you know the consequences of deceiving me?" The Epoch Book remained motionless despite its golden glow, leaving the primary spirit-essence impatient.

As a primary spirit-essence, he was imprinted with loyalty. Thus, anyone daring to mention Meng Lingyun would face his wrath.

"Alas... Xiao Xiao, you're still so hot-tempered. How many years have passed? You haven't changed!" A weathered voice echoed from the Epoch Book, causing the primary spirit-essence to pause. His aged body trembled slightly; if he could weep, this old man would be drenched in tears.

"Master! Is it you?" The primary spirit-essence, disbelief etched on his face, addressed the Epoch Book. Though he already knew, for only one person could call him Xiao Xiao—his master's name, Meng Yunxiao.

"It's not me; who else?" The weathered voice replied, golden light cascading as Meng Lingyun's aged, translucent figure appeared before the three.

Chapter 1000: Half a Master ()

Under the stars of the ancient palace, a translucent elder wore a gentle smile, gazing at his spirit-essence.

The primary spirit-essence also bore excitement as he gazed at the translucent elder hovering above. He knelt, "Master! I never thought I'd see you again!"

"Enough. My time here is limited. We're both old now—no more sentimentalities. I'm but a soul fragment; reviving me is near impossible. Yet you've preserved my body so intact over the years, giving me a chance to return. This body has a spark of life, and with that medicinal king, it can nourish my body and soul fragment!"

"I'll now enter the body. This boy is your disciple. The ancient palace may also be his!" The elder spoke, then his translucent form surged into the half-body, settling in.

"Yes!" Meng Yunxiao, the primary spirit-essence, bore reverence as he knelt before the Celestial Silkworm Jade Coffin, closing its lid. He felt Meng Lingyun's soul fragment merging with his body, a spark of life in the heart slowly reviving. Though this was a long process, it would go unnoticed without close observation.

Meng Yunxiao buried the Celestial Silkworm Jade Coffin in the cosmos, turning to Luo Tian with gratitude and reverence. "From now on, you are this palace's junior master. In this palace, anyone and anything is under your command!"

Luo Tian's eyes glimmered with a smile, exhaling deeply. The rewards matched his sacrifices.

Meng Yunxiao's face bore solemnity as he formed intricate golden waves from his hands, condensing them into a key-like object. He pushed it into Luo Tian's body.

"Buzz..." Waves surged, and Luo Tian floated mid-air, his eyes still calm. He felt the entire ancient palace at his command, as if he were its sovereign.

"Respect for the new master!" Meng Yunxiao bowed respectfully to Luo Tian, honoring him. Now, Luo Tian's status had soared in his eyes, second only to Meng Lingyun. With Meng Lingyun needing years to recover—or perhaps never—Luo Tian was the de facto master of the ancient palace.

Luo Tian helped Meng Yunxiao up, speaking softly: "Elder need not perform such grand gestures. First, tell me about the ancient palace's situation."

Under Luo Tian's inquiry, Meng Yunxiao recounted the ancient palace's details—its restrictions, activation methods, etc.

"Let's go! It's time to leave!" Luo Tian placed three medicinal herbs that replenished essence blood into his mouth, preparing to exit the ancient palace.

"Buzz..." Waves surged as Luo Tian, Long Jie, and Meng Yunxiao appeared in the previous hall.

"Boom..." Upon arrival, Luo Tian heard a thunderous sound. A blackened staff slammed toward him.

Meng Yunxiao's reflexes were swift; he caught the staff, his face darkening. The hall grew cold.

Luo Tian quickly addressed Meng Yunxiao: "Elder, I'm sorry. This is my brother's weapon!"

As Meng Yunxiao and the three appeared, the hall gradually fell silent. Everyone's faces bore anticipation toward Luo Tian.

Especially the four saintly domains and fire domain people, their faces brimming with expectation. Before, when Sun Mengru and Feng Jiutian exited, only Luo Tian and Long Jie remained. Their hearts had surged with excitement; they knew that leaving two meant something.

Everyone's gaze fell on Luo Tian, locking eyes with him. Seeing his bitter shake of the head and pale face, they felt disappointment.

"Alas..." Though prepared, seeing Luo Tian's head shake left them disheartened. After all, Luo Tian had always created miracles, but now he clearly hadn't succeeded.

Others sighed, relieved that Luo Tian had failed—meaning they still had a chance, albeit with harsher methods.

Luo Tian and spirit-essence Meng Yunxiao had already planned to feign failure. If Luo Tian's ancient palace news spread, it would endanger him. Treasure entices hearts; especially epoch relics that even epoch lords covet.

Meng Yunxiao nodded in agreement, his face still cold—this was all prearranged. He handed the blackened staff to Luo Tian, addressing everyone coldly: "The ancient palace didn't choose a master this time. If you wish to leave, you may stand on the altar anytime. Let those three send you out. If you still wish to vie for the epoch mark, continue!" Meng Yunxiao spoke coldly, his face showing sorrow—playing the role to the end.

Meng Yunxiao pointed, and the three subordinate spirit-essences vanished, their faces showing displeasure.

"Alas... it seems the master can't be revived. This old man's efforts were all for nothing!" The three spirit-essences, still in the dark, bore sorrowful expressions.

Luo Tian's face was pale; the three herbs slowly digested within him, his essence blood recovering at a terrifying speed.

He approached Chen Zhanbiao, handing the blackened staff to him with a smile: "What's wrong?"

"Nothing. They told me to fight, so I did! But this old man's strong!" Chen Zhanbiao scratched his head, addressing Luo Tian.

Luo Tian glanced at Ding Wenxing across from him, unsure of the situation. Other factions' people had also been wounded—except those who exited before Luo Tian.

Through explanations, Luo Tian understood: after he and his group entered the cosmos, everyone had begun a challenge to vie for the epoch mark's qualification.

Others had targeted opponents—Diao Dezhu and others were cunning, choosing Ding Wenxing. They'd challenged him in groups, leaving him tormented. Now, Ding Wenxing looked like a beggar, no longer resembling a saintly mid-level.

"Enough! No more challenges. We're leaving!" Luo Tian addressed the group, unwilling to let them sense the epoch mark.

Though they could deliberately avoid sensing it, it would still harm their future cultivation—others' insights would inevitably affect them.

"But!" People's faces bore disappointment; that was the epoch mark. Once this chance passed, it would never return.

People watched Du Hongtao and Lu Hantian sit on the altar, beginning to sense it. Their faces showed anxiety.

"Never mind. Let two elders sense it!" Luo Tian shrugged, for he was now effectively the palace's master. He could enter anytime without obstacles.

People couldn't persuade Luo Tian; they knew he wouldn't let them suffer, so they nodded and stood behind him, waiting for Du Hongtao and Lu Hantian to finish sensing.

Other factions had people seated on the altar, sensing the epoch mark's imprint. They weren't like Luo Tian, a prodigy confident in breaking through their limits to become an epoch lord. For them, it was too difficult.

After instructing everyone to guard him, Luo Tian sat on the ground, refining the three herbs to recover his strength. He also attempted to use their explosive medicinal power to冲击 the Dao's suppression on his back.

Long Jie communicated with eighteen people, discussing their future—whether they should leave or stay. Though the eighteen came from different domains, after long years, they were like family. After brief discussions and Long Jie's persuasion, the eighteen decided to stay in the palace, stating Luo Tian could always enter.

Time passed slowly; after three days, Luo Tian finally refined the herbs' power. His essence blood recovered significantly, though his core was still depleted. It had nearly returned to normal, but the herbs' immense power couldn't affect the Dao's suppression. He'd tried several times to冲击 it, but no ripples emerged.

"Alas..." Luo Tian sighed deeply; though he knew it wouldn't be simple, disappointment lingered.

"Need to think of another way!" Luo Tian mentally sighed, pondering how to break the Dao's suppression and what path lay ahead.

"Buzz..." After seven more days of waiting, the altar finally emitted waves. Several powerful auras emerged from it, drawing everyone's attention to the altar.

"The epoch mark is truly terrifying; even without full sensing, it has brought several into the saintly mid-level!" People's faces bore envy, though it faded quickly.

Du Hongtao and Lu Hantian exchanged glances, stood up, and approached Luo Tian's group with smiles.

"In the future, if you can avoid using this sensing to advance, do so. Better yet, break through the epoch realm on your own!" Luo Tian spoke softly. Though it would be difficult for them to achieve the epoch realm, he hoped they could do so independently and go further.

"Ha! Don't say more; we're already satisfied with entering the epoch realm!" Lu Hantian was pragmatic, addressing everyone.

Others from different factions also bore joy, imagining taking this sensing back to their clans. They'd let the old masters nearing death sense it and enter the epoch realm—those elders would surely thank them.

"Alright, since you've all finished, those who wish to leave may go to the altar. This is the first time the ancient palace has actively let people depart; you should feel fortunate!" The three subordinate spirit-essences spoke impatiently to the crowd.

Chapter 1001: Leaving the Ancient Palace ()

In the demon domain, under endless stars, the ancient palace's emergence had stirred excitement. A massive palace stood in the cosmos, surrounded by figures gazing at it with awe.

It had been nearly half a year since Luo Tian and his group entered the ancient palace. Factions eventually lost patience, leaving some to wait for news while others returned to the saint city.

Yet some cultivators remained curious about who would emerge from the ancient palace—each exit made one a renowned prodigy across nine domains.

"Legends say at most only one person could emerge each time. Alas, how many geniuses will perish in the palace!" People murmured, waiting for the prodigy to emerge.

"Buzz..." As people discussed, the ancient palace—silent for half a year—finally emitted waves. The palace glowed again with immense power, and a vast transmission force surged within it.

"Is it coming out?" People's faces bore excitement and curiosity, their gazes fixed on the ancient palace.

Golden light filled the air as figures emerged into view, leaving people stunned.

"One... two..." People were bewildered, counting the emerging figures.

"Twenty-four! Oh my god, so many!" A cultivator exclaimed, his voice filled with disbelief.

"How can there be so many? It was said only one or two people would emerge each time!" People murmured, watching Luo Tian and his group.

"Buzz..." After the ancient palace expelled Luo Tian's group, it glowed again before fading into the cosmos.

"Leaving!" Luo Tian smiled slightly, sensing an invisible connection as the ancient palace grew distant.

"Demon domain's aura!" Luo Tian smiled, sensing the familiar surroundings, his face filled with nostalgia.

Others sighed deeply, gazing at the endless cosmos. Half a year had felt like a dream; recalling their experiences within the ancient palace, thousands of people remained only twenty-four—breaking past records.

"Luo Xiong, we must part ways. Take care! If you have the chance, visit our Star-Seeking Domain!" Surrounding people smiled, scanning their gazes over the crowd. They knew the real test had begun.

Luo Tian furrowed his brow, then gazed at the intense stares around him. He understood roughly and bowed to Zhou Wei: "Safe travels!"

Zhou Wei greeted Sun Mengru, then led Star-Seeking Domain people away. Meanwhile, Luo Tian felt several figures secretly following the Star-Seeking Domain group.

Luo Tian's brow furrowed slightly, worrying about Sun Mengru's safety. He addressed her: "You're returning to the divine clan?"

"Yes! Our Grand Elder is coming toward the demon domain, waiting for us to regroup!" Sun Mengru's face bore a complex expression. In the ancient palace, they could cooperate, but outside it, Luo Tian was an enemy of the divine clan.

"Take care! I'll bring the Reincarnation Pills to visit your clan. When that time comes, I hope you'll take them!" Luo Tian transmitted his words to Sun Mengru, not wanting others to hear.

"Yes," Sun Mengru nodded slightly, her aura surging. Her cold gaze swept over the crowd.

"Go!" Sun Mengru showed no fear, and as they exited the ancient palace, the divine clan's people had grown stronger. Three saintly mid-level masters could deter many.

As Star-Seeking Domain and divine clan people left, only Luo Tian's group and Feng Jiutian remained. Feng Jiutian's face was grim, gazing at Luo Tian before heading toward the saint city with demon domain people.

"Alas..." Luo Tian knew his pseudo-epoch relic's secret could not be hidden; someone powerful might attack him. Who it was, or which faction, remained uncertain.

Luo Tian wanted to leave immediately but had to inform Gu Lei and Du Yuying of the Rhino Clan.

He gazed at everyone, but with Diao Dezhu by his side, he knew in the demon domain, no saintly peak power could harm him.

Eight people had survived without death, and their strength had significantly improved. Luo Tian was satisfied with this ancient palace journey, especially since the ancient palace now served as a foundation for the Fire Domain and Four Saintly Domains.

Due to Luo Tian, the Fire Domain and Four Saintly Domains were now one family—stranded together.

"We should go too; this is a dangerous place to linger!" Luo Tian addressed the group, heading toward the saint city.

The demon domain's saint city was lively. Within half a day, Luo Tian and his group arrived. On the way, Luo Tian felt several spiritual senses locking onto them, secretly following behind.

When they reached the saint city, news of their emergence from the ancient palace spread throughout the demon domain.

"Did you hear? The Demon Clan and Thunder Domain both perished in the ancient palace!"

"Yes, I heard. Even our demon domain's eight saintly clans suffered heavy losses. It seems related to that man from the Four Saintly Domains. Who knew the Fire Domain and Four Saintly Domains were so strong!" Luo Tian's group had barely entered when they overheard the city's chatter, with some unintentionally attributing the major factions' losses to Luo Tian.

"You know what? I heard the ancient palace had three pseudo-epoch relics. One was taken by the divine clan, another by Star-Seeking Domain, and the third—Epoch Bell was taken by Luo Tian. Truly remarkable!" Various rumors reached Luo Tian's ears, thrusting him into the spotlight and causing Xu Liyi and others to frown.

"Damn it, it must be Feng Jiutian's doing! He dares not offend the divine clan and Star-Seeking Domain, so he blames everything on us, slandering us!" Xu Liyi and others cursed as Luo Tian's group arrived at the Rhino Clan's territory.

Luo Tian furrowed his brow; he wasn't afraid of common cultivators causing trouble but feared saintly peak power. In this era without epoch lords, saintly peak was a godlike presence.

As they entered the Rhino Clan's territory, Luo Tian sensed changes—few people remained, only a few young masters hurriedly heading toward the Rhino Clan's training ground.

"Luo Tian Senior, you're back?" A Rhino Clan disciple from Jiuyuan saw Luo Tian's group and changed his expression, greeting them.

"Yes, we're back. What happened?" As Luo Tian spoke, he extended his spiritual sense across the Rhino Clan's territory.

Du Hongtao and Lu Hantian, now saintly mid-level masters, also extended their spiritual senses. Their expressions shifted slightly, eyes flashing coldness as they vanished from the spot.

At the Rhino Clan's training ground, a vast arena stood filled with clan members. The clan leader, Xiu Hongda, bore a smile as he gazed at several haughty youths and elders.
