After two months of alchemy refinement, even Luo Tian felt the strain. Today marked the completion of all his debts. He extended a storage bag to Dong Sansi, who had been waiting outside, instructing him to distribute the elixirs among those who had assisted.

Dong Sansi accepted the bag without hesitation, then departed toward other peaks, leaving Luo Tian alone at the site.

Watching Dong Sansi's distant figure vanish into the horizon, Luo Tian reflected on recent events. Within months, so much had transpired—so much that he felt unprepared, even before fully recovering from the sorrow of Chen Yunting's death, Gu Qianshi and Gu Le had been taken.

"Unknown to me, how are you both faring?" Luo Tian murmured softly, his face etched with longing.

"Though I am now invincible in the Body-Transformation Realm, even against a Bone-Transformation Initial Stage powerhouse I could fight, it's still not enough. Against true masters, I remain as insignificant as an ant!" Luo Tian sat cross-legged on the ground, mentally calculating.

"Half of my Nascent Soul liquid has formed. To convert all my energy into Nascent Soul droplets, I need an opportunity—alone, it would take years. The Washing Spirit Pool won't open for another three months; I can't enter immediately!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, clearly disliking the monotony of cultivation.

A faint energy fluctuation emanated from Luo Tian's storage ring. Curious, he opened it to locate the source.

A crystalline jade tablet appeared in his hand, flickering with light as a voice echoed into his mind.

"Luo Xiong, have you been well? I possess an opportunity—do you find it intriguing?" Chen Changsheng's voice resonated.

Hearing the word "opportunity," Luo Tian's eyes brightened. He had been troubled by his slow progress; now, a solution seemed to arrive as if summoned.

Luo Tian swiftly replied, transmitting his thoughts through the jade tablet.

Chapter 192: Departure

The Five Elements Sect's Alchemy Hall, Zhang Ziping and others sat upon the grand hall's throne. Luo Tian stood humbly in its center.

"You're leaving again? You've only returned a few days—can't you stay and rest in the Alchemy Hall?" Lu Kunpeng's discontented voice rang out.

Zhang Ziping and other elders, observing Lu Kunpeng's anger, exchanged wry smiles, pitying Luo Tian.

Luo Tian stood awkwardly, his heart bitter yet strategizing how to persuade this stubborn elder.

"Do you know the Tianshi Sect has appeared in the Northern Region? Even your older brother's last mission found no clues. If you go now and encounter Tianshi Sect masters, what then?"

Lu Kunpeng continued bellowing.

Hearing the Tianshi Sect's name, the hall grew solemn. Even Zhang Ziping furrowed his brows.

After receiving Luo Tian's report, he led a group of Bone-Transformation Realm masters to search the Northern Region. They found only small cities slaughtered, arriving too late to find the Tianshi Sect's traces.

Despite relentless pursuit, no valuable clues emerged—yet it was certain the Tianshi Sect had resurfaced. This news spread among Northern Region's top sects, with major factions urging their disciples to avoid unnecessary travel. Even second-tier sects kept their precious disciples indoors.

Few in the hall supported Luo Tian's departure; after all, he was a treasure within the Alchemy Hall. If anything befell him, the elders would be devastated.

"Let me accompany your younger brother!" Lei Yong tentatively proposed.

"You may go or stay as you wish, but Luo Tian cannot!" The elders led by Lu Kunpeng replied sharply.

Lei Yong and other disciples of the elders, observing their intense reactions, wore expressions of surprise. Their elders' responses seemed overly harsh.

"Truly, people compare themselves to death, goods to being discarded!" Lei Yong sighed, patting his head before returning behind Zhang Ziping.

"I must go," Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with determination, gazing at the elders. A chance to enhance his strength was one he could not ignore.

"I support him. If he cannot overcome this challenge, he is unworthy of being our Alchemy Hall's disciple!" Zhang Ziping spoke up, clearly confident in his younger brother.

Lu Kunpeng would not disregard others' faces, but he could not ignore Zhang Ziping's authority as the Alchemy Hall's head. Yet, he feared Luo Tian's safety—such a loss would be devastating for the Alchemy Hall.

Seeing Zhang Ziping speak, other elders fell silent, realizing this was now a dialogue between Zhang and Lu Kunpeng. They could not interject.

"Agreed, but only if you can withstand my three strikes! This will prove your ability to escape even from a Bone-Transformation Peak master. If you fail, then stay here and wait until the Tianshi Sect matter is resolved!" Lu Kunpeng set his final condition.

"Ah," Zhang Ziping had no reply to Lu Kunpeng's words.

Others were equally astonished. Though Luo Tian was strong, he still lagged behind Lu Kunpeng's Bone-Transformation Peak level. Not even one strike would he survive, they thought.

Zhang Ziping glanced at Luo Tian, his eyes filled with helplessness. This was the last chance he could secure for Luo Tian. If he spoke further, Lu Kunpeng's stubbornness would surely reject his face.

Luo Tian surveyed the elders, a contemplative expression on his face before he nodded slightly: "Fine."

As Luo Tian's words fell, the entire hall turned their gaze to him, wondering what confidence he had to withstand Lu Kunpeng's three strikes.

"Hmph! Arrogant!" Lu Kunpeng snorted, leading the way out of the hall toward the Alchemy Hall's training ground.

Others followed closely, and soon, news of Luo Tian facing Lu Kunpeng's three strikes spread throughout the Alchemy Hall. This quiet place stirred once more.

"Did you hear? Luo Tian is facing the Senior Elder's three strikes!"
"Yes, I heard. Unexpectedly, Luo Tian has grown so strong he dares challenge the Senior Elder! The Senior Elder is a Bone-Transformation Peak master!" People murmured, rushing toward the training ground.

At that moment, Luo Tian and Lu Kunpeng stood near each other, Luo Tian's face solemn.

Never before had he witnessed Lu Kunpeng's combat prowess, but having fought alongside him against a thunderstorm, Luo Tian knew Lu Kunpeng was among the top in Bone-Transformation Peak.

"Kid, don't think your abilities make you so arrogant!" Lu Kunpeng scolded.

"Senior Elder, please show mercy!" Luo Tian's lips curled into a grimace.

"Enough talk—prepare for the first strike!" Lu Kunpeng, uninterested in replying, clenched his fist. His figure vanished before Luo Tian's eyes, striking with a punch.

Luo Tian's spiritual awareness had already spread out; sensing Lu Kunpeng's presence before him, he quickly activated his arms to block.

A deep furrow formed beneath Luo Tian's feet as he spat blood, standing several paces away.

"He blocked it! Luo Tian truly is Luo Tian—how could he withstand the Senior Elder's attack!" The Alchemy Hall disciples marveled.

Lu Kunpeng's eyes flickered with surprise; he had expected this punch to incapacitate Luo Tian, but instead, the latter had only spat blood.

Luo Tian felt unwell; his arms felt foreign, unable to lift. If another strike came, he would be severely injured and unable to flee. He had an appointment with Chen Changsheng three days later.

"Kid, good! The next strike won't be so easy!" Lu Kunpeng ignored Luo Tian's injuries.

A fierce fire-elemental energy coalesced again, its power easily double that of the first strike.

"Block it! I must block it!" Luo Tian gritted his teeth, roaring as he moved his numb arms. His liquid Nascent Soul surged through his body, gathering into his arms.

Chapter 193: Yongyang Town

"Crash!" The sharp sound echoed again.

Yet this time, Luo Tian was far more battered. His entire body flew backward, and a clear crack echoed from his arms.

"Spit! Spitting blood," Luo Tian coughed, closing his eyes as wood-elemental energy surged into his arms to mend the broken bones.

"Kid, are you continuing? If so, you may not even walk for a month!" Lu Kunpeng observed Luo Tian lying motionless, his voice soft but with a hint of pity.

The onlookers gazed at Luo Tian, who lay coughing blood, their faces filled with admiration. They could clearly sense the power of Lu Kunpeng's two punches.

The first punch was unblockable for a Body-Transformation Realm disciple; the second could not be withstood by even a Bone-Transformation Initial Stage master. Luo Tian, though his body was extraordinary, had still blocked it.

Luo Tian felt unbearable pain; his hands, now recovered slightly, pressed against the ground. Yet chest pains made breathing difficult, and his consciousness wavered.

"I await you!" Luo Tian recalled Gu Qianshi's farewell that night, and Chen Yunting's pale figure in Feiyun Sect.

"Roar!" He roared, standing unsteadily amidst the astonished onlookers.

Zhang Ziping observed Luo Tian's relentless effort, his brows furrowed. He clearly saw that Luo Tian was now at his limit; even Lu Kunpeng's casual punch would be unblockable.

"Enough, kid. Return to the Alchemy Hall and cultivate! With its resources, you'll reach the Nascent Soul Realm within a decade. Why risk your life?" Lu Kunpeng sighed softly.

Luo Tian wished for a peaceful life, but Chen Changsheng's mention of an ancient tomb belonging to a Nascent Soul Realm master was irresistible. He couldn't wait ten years.

"Come on!" Luo Tian panted, speaking again.

"You! Truly ungrateful!" Lu Kunpeng's face flushed with anger as he gathered energy into his fist, slowly approaching Luo Tian five paces ahead.

"Be warned—this punch may leave you unable to even exit the sect gates!" Lu Kunpeng spoke softly.

"Come on!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with determination, gazing at Lu Kunpeng.

Lu Kunpeng furrowed his brows, reducing the energy in his fist before striking toward Luo Tian.

"Boom..." The deep sound echoed.

No one saw Luo Tian flying backward; instead, Lu Kunpeng took several steps back, his eyes filled with anger as he roared: "You cheated!"

The onlookers' mouths twitched. A bronze cauldron appeared before Luo Tian, faint thunder echoing within it.

Most Alchemy Hall disciples recognized this cauldron—it was the one Lu Kunpeng had used to block a thunderstorm. They had assumed it belonged to Lu Kunpeng, but now they realized it was Luo Tian's. This cauldron could withstand thunderstorms; naturally, it easily blocked Lu Kunpeng's strike.

"Senior Elder, you never said using an object was forbidden!" Luo Tian smiled bitterly, retracting the bronze cauldron into his storage ring.

"You! You!" Lu Kunpeng's hands, which had struck the cauldron, trembled. The backlash from the cauldron left him numb.

"Senior Elder, are you失信?" Luo Tian produced a healing pill, swallowed it to regain strength, and spoke.

"Go! Go!" Lu Kunpeng's beard twitched as he walked away, his back turned, under the amused glances of others.

As Lu Kunpeng left, Alchemy Hall disciples, seeing no further spectacle, departed one by one. Lei Yong and Ji Chen helped Luo Tian back, confirming he was unharmed. With his alchemy skills, he would recover fully, and they exited his courtyard.

Time passed swiftly; two days later, Luo Tian's injuries were minor. With his alchemy skills, he quickly recovered.

Luo Tian stood in his room, gathering items for the journey—common necessities were essential.

As he tidied up, Lu Kunpeng entered through the door without knocking, his face dark. Seeing Luo Tian packing, his expression grew even darker.

Luo Tian greeted Lu Kunpeng with a smile, inviting him to sit and apologizing.

"Hmph! Take these elixirs; don't disgrace our Alchemy Hall!" Lu Kunpeng snorted, waving his sleeve and leaving.

Luo Tian saw several elixirs on the table, radiating intense energy—clearly not common. All were top-tier five-star elixirs, with several six-star ones.

A smile tugged at his lips; warmth filled him. He knew Lu Kunpeng was a tough exterior with a soft heart. If it weren't for the Nascent Soul Realm tomb's allure, Luo Tian wouldn't have dared defy Lu Kunpeng.

...

Yongyang Town was a small town but renowned in the Northern Region for being a transportation hub. Compared to ordinary towns, it was more prosperous due to its strategic location. Frequent travelers made it bustling.

At this moment, four young men walked along Yongyang Town's streets, their faces brimming with arrogance. Anyone could tell they were not ordinary.

"Chen Xiong, when will that Luo Tian arrive? We've waited a day—must we wait longer?" A blue-cloaked youth, impatient, whispered to another in Daoist robes.

"Yes! His fame is exaggerated!"
"Indeed! Though a prodigy, he's not worthy of our wait!" The other two youths echoed with impatience.

"Three of you, stay calm. I set a three-day meeting; there's still half a day left. The Five Elements Sect is far, so wait longer!" Chen Changsheng softly advised.

"Hmph! I'll see what this renowned Luo Tian has to offer. If he lacks true talent, Chen Xiong, don't blame me for not giving you face!" The blue-cloaked youth snorted and fell silent.

The others ceased speaking, the atmosphere tense.

Just as their words faded, a raggedly dressed Luo Tian approached from afar, smiling softly: "Chen Xiong, sorry for keeping you waiting!"

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Chen Changsheng's face lit up with joy. "No problem; it was us who arrived early!"

Chapter 194: The Eternal Life Daoist Temple's Examination

Seeing Luo Tian arrive, the three youths beside Chen Changsheng turned their gaze toward him, curious and assessing this person praised by Chen Changsheng. However, upon discovering he was merely at the Body-Transformation Eighth Stage, their faces showed disdain.

"Chen Xiong, who are these three?" Luo Tian asked as he observed them.

"Now that everyone's here, I'll introduce the four of you!" Chen Changsheng spoke, introducing the three to Luo Tian.

"These three are not from the Northern Region; they're prodigies of Southern Sects!" When Chen Changsheng mentioned "Southern," the three youths' faces showed pride, clearly looking down on Northern Region people.

This was a common trait among Southern Sects; if it weren't for Chen Changsheng's strength and the Nascent Soul Realm tomb's allure, they wouldn't have traveled so far to assist him.

Hearing "Southern," Luo Tian's mind stirred—he had only heard of the Yellowneck Sect in the South, but other sects were unknown to him.

"This is the Young Master of the Heavenly Xuan Sect, Jing Boran!" Chen Changsheng pointed to the blue-cloaked youth.

"This is a prodigy of the Sky Apex Cliff, Chai Xiangming!" Chen Changsheng pointed to another white-cloaked youth.

"Fuxia Sect, Feng Tianxiong!" Without waiting for Chen Changsheng to introduce, the black-cloaked youth spoke.

"From the Five Elements Sect, Luo Tian. Please look after me!" Luo Tian smiled warmly, speaking softly.

"Rest assured! For Chen Xiong's sake, we'll look after you. Chen Xiong, I don't know what you were thinking—only Body-Transformation Eighth Stage, yet you value him so highly!" Jing Boran spoke coldly.

"Indeed! Why would the Northern Region have no one? A Body-Transformation Eighth Stage, yet he's spoken of so highly. I don't know what to say!" Chai Xiangming echoed.

Chen Changsheng had noticed Luo Tian's rank dropped to Body-Transformation Eighth Stage, but recalling his former strength at Body-Transformation Ninth Stage, he knew Luo Tian was no ordinary person. Though unsure why his rank had dropped, he trusted Luo Tian's strength.

Hearing their cold remarks, Chen Changsheng felt awkward. He glanced at Luo Tian, his face showing apology: "Luo Xiong, these three are prodigies of top Southern Sects; they're naturally arrogant. Please bear with them!"

Luo Tian heard their words and Chen Changsheng's, frowning slightly. He clearly felt these three were inferior to Shangguan Hongtu; he had no fear of them. However, with his current standards, he didn't bother explaining. If they pushed too far, he wouldn't mind giving them an unforgettable lesson.

"Rest assured; I won't take it to heart!" Luo Tian smiled, sending his thoughts into Chen Changsheng's mind. Yet he added silently: "Don't provoke me."

After sending his thoughts, Chen Changsheng also sent reassuring words to the three.

Though they could disregard Luo Tian, they had to respect Chen Changsheng; after all, his strength was slightly superior.

The three youths glanced at Luo Tian coldly. Jing Boran spoke: "As a prodigy of the Five Elements Sect, you should protect yourself. If conflict arises, we may not be able to assist; take care of yourself!"

"Rest assured; if I've come here, I have the means to survive!" Luo Tian spoke calmly. If they wouldn't give him a good face, he had no need to use his warm side to meet their coldness.

"Haha! Enough! We're all companions; we should support each other!" Chen Changsheng played mediator.

"Now that Luo Tian has arrived, let's find a place to sit and I'll explain the location of this cave!" Chen Changsheng, seeing all four standing awkwardly, spoke.

This was challenging for Chen Changsheng; he wasn't naturally talkative, so he struggled to ease the tension. He focused on explaining their mission.

The four had no objections; under Chen Changsheng's guidance, they found a teahouse and took a private room.

Not long after the server placed the last dish, Chen Changsheng closed the door and began explaining their mission's location and precautions.

Hearing Chen Changsheng's account, Luo Tian understood why he had sought help.

This mission wasn't just a treasure hunt but also an exam for the Water Source Daoist Temple's disciples. The winner would become the next temple master and gain more resources.

This Nascent Soul Realm tomb was discovered by a Nascent Soul Realm master of the Water Source Daoist Temple. The era of this Nascent Soul Realm master was unknown, but the entire tomb had been controlled by the Water Source Daoist Temple. When the three examinees and their companions arrived, it would open for them to enter.

These three examinees could each invite four assistants—this tested their connections. As a temple master, one must be strong and have extensive networks.

"Additionally, the other two examinees are roughly my level; if it were a prolonged fight, I could suppress one but only barely. Letting them suffer light injuries would be the best outcome!" Chen Changsheng sighed, looking at the four.

"Chen Xiong, rest assured! We'll do our best to assist you!" The three youths spoke softly, promising.

"Then I entrust the four of you! I'll only take the final token; as for other items, I won't share with you. After success, I'll gift each of you three million energy stones as thanks!" Chen Changsheng spoke softly, stating his conditions.

Hearing Chen Changsheng's promise, the three youths' faces lit up—three million energy stones were a significant temptation.

"So do you know who they've invited?" Luo Tian asked without promising anything.

"I'm not sure," Chen Changsheng shook his head slightly.

"Hmph! If you're afraid, leave now! It's still timely to replace someone. Chen Xiong, should I call another from the sect?" Hearing Luo Tian's words, Chai Xiangming sneered.

Chapter 195: Pang Haoran Arrives

Hearing Chai Xiangming's words, Luo Tian's face flashed with a cold glint. His spiritual awareness spread out, his eyes suddenly locking onto Chai Xiangming speaking.

Chai Xiangming felt a pressure, instinctively looking up—his eyes met Luo Tian's cold gaze. His body shivered involuntarily, and his words halted mid-sentence.

"Don't try to provoke me!" Luo Tian spoke coldly.

Luo Tian hadn't intended to quarrel with these three, but their repeated dismissals and sarcastic remarks had pushed him. In the past, he might have exploded in anger, but after much experience, he had become more composed. He didn't want to clash with anyone now.

But this did not mean he was weak. If his non-confrontation led to them overstepping, he would have no choice but to crush the nuisance, preventing it from becoming a persistent annoyance.

"You!" Seemingly stunned by Luo Tian's gaze, Chai Xiangming felt his pride wounded. His face darkened.

"Chen Xiong, it's not that I don't give you face; today, I'll let him know what 'there are people beyond' and 'heavens above' mean. If he thinks his fame in the Northern Region is enough, then..." Chai Xiangming spoke to Chen Changsheng while his aura surged.

"Chen Xiong, we should be harmonious!" Chen Changsheng saw Chai Xiangming's impending outburst and intervened.

"Chen Xiong, don't interfere! We want to see what this Northern Region prodigy has. After all, it's a Nascent Soul Realm tomb. If he can withstand Chai Xiong's attack for a minute, we'll let him join. Otherwise, we'll take our leave!" Jing Boran stopped Chen Changsheng, whispering to calm him.

Feng Tianxiong folded his arms, watching the scene with amusement—clearly agreeing with their actions.

"Luo Xiong! This..." Chen Changsheng looked at Luo Tian, his face troubled. He didn't know what to do.

"Luo Xiong, since they want to play, I'll join them! A minute is enough!" Luo Tian smiled, knowing this fight was unavoidable. Without strength, it would be hard to gain the respect of these arrogant prodigies.

As he spoke, Luo Tian's aura surged rapidly, his energy circulating swiftly in his body, awaiting Chai Xiangming's attack.

"Haha! Chen Shidi, you arrived early!" A cheerful voice echoed from the teahouse's entrance.

The door opened, five figures appearing outside. Like Chen Changsheng and the others, their attire varied but one common trait: youthfulness.

Hearing someone arrive, Luo Tian and Chai Xiangming's auras gradually lowered as they turned their gaze to the entrance.

"Ying Hongtu?" Luo Tian saw the five people outside, recognizing a familiar face among them—the disciple of Lei Ming Sect who had clashed with him in the Dian Forest. Ying Hongtu stood at the back, while a tall youth led them. This youth wore the Water Source Daoist Temple's robe—without doubt, this was one of Chen Changsheng's rivals.

As for the other three, Luo Tian didn't know their identities. Observing their positions, Ying Hongtu stood at the back—only someone truly formidable could make such an arrogant person stand behind.

Feeling their auras, Luo Tian was slightly surprised; he sensed these three were no less than Chai Xiangming's group, even slightly stronger. Their eyes held infinite arrogance.

"Master Pang, you arrived early too!" Chen Changsheng saw the five people at the door, a faint smile on his face. He also noticed these three and wore a slight frown—intuitively, he felt they were no less than himself.

"Gu Zhengye!" As Chen Changsheng's words ended, Chai Xiangming gasped softly.

"Chai Xiong, it's been a while!" A youth heard Chai Xiangming's gasp and smiled playfully, clearly someone acquainted with him.

"Tuobayeh, Zhuang Shengjie, you?" Chai Xiangming didn't answer Gu Zhengye's greeting but called out the names of the other two youths.

Jing Boran and Feng Tianxiong, standing with Chen Changsheng, wore solemn faces—clearly acquainted with these three. Their sects were renowned in the Southern Region, and their strength was slightly superior to theirs.

"Unexpectedly, you're here too! Then we are competitors!" The three youths looked at Chai Xiangming's group, smiling. Luo Tian, a Body-Transformation Eighth Stage disciple, was excluded.

Ying Hongtu stood behind the three, naturally seeing Luo Tian. His eyes turned fierce, sensing Luo Tian had dropped to Body-Transformation Eighth Stage—his heart rejoiced, eyes flashing a hint of killing intent.

Chen Changsheng's face was solemn as he observed Pang Haoran's group, his mind surprised. If Luo Tian were excluded, their side was clearly weaker than Pang Haoran's. For Luo Tian, Chen Changsheng had no confidence.

At that time, he had defeated Luo Tian; then, Luo Tian was at Body-Transformation Ninth Stage. Now, his rank had dropped to Eighth—this confused Chen Changsheng.

"Chen Shidi, who is this?" Pang Haoran noticed Luo Tian's Body-Transformation Eighth Stage and sneered.

"From the Five Elements Sect, Luo Tian!" Before Chen Changsheng could speak, Ying Hongtu's voice echoed from behind Pang Haoran, laced with resentment.

Hearing Ying Hongtu's words, Pang Haoran glanced at Luo Tian for a moment. Upon confirming he was truly Body-Transformation Eighth Stage, he shook his head slightly. He knew that with Luo Tian's inclusion, Chen Changsheng's side was significantly weaker than his.

"He is the one you Northern Region spoke so highly of, isn't he?" Gu Zhengye spoke, his face carrying mockery.

"The Northern Region truly has no one worthy of mention! That Wang Suyuan was also a fool, dying at his hands. I have no words!" Zhuang Shengjie's face was kind but his tone carried disdain.

"He was truly strong, but I don't know why his rank dropped to Body-Transformation Eighth. Perhaps it's related to the conflict with the Xuan Yin Sect a few days ago!" Ying Hongtu spoke, his body radiating battle intent—clearly wanting to avenge the clash in Dian Forest.

Chapter 196: Arrival at the Tomb

Feeling Ying Hongtu's battle intent, Luo Tian remained calm. After all, this was to help Chen Changsheng; external matters were better left uninvolved.

"Luo Tian, dare you fight?" Ying Hongtu shouted, his body radiating lightning as he stood above.

"Then fight!" Being named so directly, Luo Tian could not remain silent.

A powerful fluctuation emanated from Luo Tian's body, shaking the teacups on the table.

"Hmm?" Sensing Luo Tian's formidable aura, they all glanced at him with curiosity—ordinary Body-Transformation Eighth Stage disciples could not generate such an aura.

Yet, it was only curiosity; the gap in levels couldn't be bridged by sheer aura.

"Ying Hongtu! What are you doing?" Chen Changsheng worried Luo Tian would lose, standing before him and scolding softly.

"If we finish them here, why bother fighting in the tomb?" Gu Zhengye's face bore disdain. Now their side was slightly stronger than Chen Changsheng's.

Pang Haoran and his group, hearing Gu Zhengye's words, wore contemplative expressions. Chen Changsheng's side turned solemn.

Chen Changsheng stared at Pang Haoran, who appeared robust but was clearly a cunning man. He knew that among the three, Pang Haoran was the most skilled at calculation.

Pang Haoran looked at Chen Changsheng and his group, his face calm but internally weighing whether it was worth fighting here.

The teahouse fell silent, everyone watching Pang Haoran's decision. If he gave the order, this teahouse would be instantly destroyed.

"Haha! We are all fellow disciples; why fight now? Let's not harm our harmony!" Pang Haoran laughed, speaking.

Hearing Pang Haoran's words, except for Luo Tian, Chen Changsheng's side sighed in relief. They believed they were currently at a disadvantage and it was better not to fight now.

Pang Haoran's side, however, wore disappointment—especially Ying Hongtu, who longed to crush Luo Tian immediately.

But since Pang Haoran had spoken, Ying Hongtu, the weakest among them, had little say. He could only give up, his face dark as he returned to the group's back.

Pang Haoran also didn't want to finish Chen Changsheng now, but he thought if they did so, their side would suffer losses. Then, encountering the elder brother in the tomb would be problematic.

"Then we won't disturb you here!" Pang Haoran waved his hand, leading the four out of the teahouse and toward the town's outskirts.

Watching Pang Haoran leave, Chen Changsheng's face darkened.

"Chen Xiong, you've seen the situation. It's still timely to replace Luo Tian!" Jing Boran spoke loudly, wanting to swap Luo Tian out.

Hearing Jing Boran's words, Chen Changsheng's face darkened as he looked at Luo Tian. At this moment, his hesitation was clear—Pang Haoran's side had impressed him deeply.

He gazed at Luo Tian, who was also quietly watching Chen Changsheng. Their eyes met for a moment; Chen Changsheng saw that flicker of confidence in Luo Tian's gaze, reminiscent of when they had competed for the Nascent Soul Vein.

Chen Changsheng spoke: "Let's go! Even if we fail, my promise still holds."

Jing Boran and the others wore disappointed expressions. They were upset that Luo Tian wasn't replaced, but since Chen Changsheng had spoken, they couldn't press further. At least, they would gain three million energy stones, which wasn't a loss for them.

The group had no desire to stay and drink tea; they all left the teahouse, exiting Yongyang Town. As soon as they stepped out of the town, they unleashed their speed toward a distant high mountain.

...

Tianmang Mountain was a small hill one hundred miles from Yongyang Town. Yet, recently, it had emitted intense array fluctuations, discovered by a Water Source Daoist Temple disciple. The discovery was reported to the sect.

Initially, the Water Source Daoist Temple thought it was a common hermit's cave. However, an investigation by a Nascent Soul Realm master revealed it was the secluded retreat of an ancient Nascent Soul Realm master.

At this moment, the entire hill was guarded by Water Source Daoist Temple disciples; no one else was allowed to pass.

A gust of wind blew, and Chen Changsheng's group arrived at the mountain's base.
