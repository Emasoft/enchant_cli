“Too much Soul Spirit has been drained!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed a bitter smile, feeling his current Soul Spirit state was less than half of its peak.

“Careless! This lotus can read the heart’s deepest desires and, when caught off guard, infiltrates!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed intense fear. He hadn’t expected this Soul Seed to possess such a function after growing.

“What should I do? I must escape quickly; if I linger, my condition will worsen. This isn’t a game!” Luo Tian’s heart grew anxious, feeling his Soul Spirit drained constantly.

“This must be a self-preservation function. The Soul Seed itself likely holds no offensive power,” Luo Tian continuously resisted the absorbing force while strategizing an escape.

“Since I entered, I’ve always shown strong hostility. If I hadn’t, would this lotus have let me go?” Luo Tian mused, then closed his eyes again, calming his aura to avoid thinking of Chen Zhanbiao.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian relaxed his mind, recalling other matters, the gray soul threads around him gradually loosened.

Chapter 1689: Resolution

“Hum…” A single gray soul thread slowly loosened from Luo Tian, allowing him a sigh of relief.

“One… ten… a hundred…” Each thread retracted into the lotus’s vast form.

“It actually worked!” Luo Tian’s gray eyes gleamed with joy, yet his mind remained alert, striving to reduce his hostility toward the lotus.

“Hum…” But as Luo Tian’s joy barely surfaced, a crimson mark on the gray lotus flickered. The soul threads instantly constricted again.

“Damn…” Luo Tian’s face darkened. As the threads tightened, his gray body shot forward; he couldn’t afford to be caught again.

With all his might, Luo Tian transformed into a streak of gray light, instantly breaking free from the soul threads’ grasp.

After surging past ten zhangs, Luo Tian’s Soul Spirit halted, still entangled by several gray threads.

“Break!” Luo Tian waved his hand, and the Soul Blade reformed in his grip, slicing at the gray threads.

“Pang…” The thin gray lines were severed by Luo Tian’s Soul Blade, and his body vanished from the spot, appearing a hundred zhang away from the lotus.

“Tenacious opponent!” Luo Tian observed the dense soul threads not pursuing him, exhaling a long breath with wary eyes.

“My current state is poor; if caught again, I’d be helpless!” Luo Tian muttered, strategizing how to resolve this predicament.

“It must be the mark. The lotus had already relaxed before, but after that mark flickered, it resumed its attack! All this is due to that strange mark!” Luo Tian recalled the crimson mark on the lotus.

“Who could have left such a technique? Is it Seventh-Generation Guardian Qiu Jingming? I distinctly remember he was dead!” Luo Tian couldn’t fathom who else could orchestrate such a sequence.

“Was that voice from Zhanbiao?” He then recalled the voice that had awakened him, his eyes deep in thought.

“First, I need to restore my Soul Spirit! I’m no match for this lotus now!” Luo Tian’s mind shifted, allowing the repulsion from Zhanbiao’s physical form to act upon him, transporting him into the hall.

The hum resonated; Luo Tian’s Soul Spirit returned to his body, merging with it. His face bore a pale hue as he slowly opened his eyes.

Without hesitation, Luo Tian retrieved a Soul Spirit-recovery pill, swallowed it, and resumed meditation to refine it.

Time flowed slowly. Three days later, Luo Tian opened his eyes again. His gray Soul Spirit materialized outside his body, re-entering Zhanbiao’s form.

“Zhanbiao…” Luo Tian stood a hundred zhang away from the gray lotus, attempting to call out. Yet there was no response, leaving him puzzled.

“This time, I’ll see how you ensnare me!” His face turned cold. He waved his hand, and a gray long sword materialized in his grip, slowly approaching the lotus.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian reached fifty zhang, the surroundings shifted again. He found himself in a room, where a slender figure stood before him.

“Luo Tian…” Fu Xingxuan turned slowly, smiling as she approached.

“Still the same old trick!” Luo Tian muttered, his hands moving swiftly. A golden seal formed in his grasp, shattering the scene as his perception returned.

The hum echoed; hundreds of gray soul threads emerged like venomous snakes before Luo Tian.

Luo Tian smirked, his Soul Blade expanding violently as he slashed at a thread.

“Puff…” In an instant, the serpentine thread was severed, dispersing into gray Soul Spirit energy around him.

“Seize the moment and finish you!” Luo Tian wielded his gray long sword, slicing through each thread as he advanced toward the lotus.

“Twenty zhang… ten zhang…” Soon, Luo Tian stood before the lotus housing Zhanbiao’s Soul Spirit. He spotted the crimson mark, his face darkening as he pointed.

“Soul Refining!” A surge of gray Soul Spirit energy erupted from his finger, a force uniquely suppressing souls. It struck the crimson mark.

“Ah…” A harrowing, piercing cry echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. Wisps of blue smoke rose from the gray lotus.

“It’s done!” Luo Tian smiled, watching the crimson mark vanish under his strike. His gaze turned to Zhanbiao on the lotus.

“Zhanbiao, wake up!” Luo Tian’s voice rang out with authority, its waves penetrating Zhanbiao’s Soul Spirit.

“Ah…” Soon after Luo Tian’s voice, a long yawn echoed in his ears. A smile spread across Luo Tian’s face.

“Finally awake!” Luo Tian sighed, then his gray Soul Spirit floated up to match Zhanbiao’s height.

“Huh?… Where am I? Why is this like this? What is this thing? Did I die?” Zhanbiao’s gray face bore confusion, seeing the threads around him. He panicked.

“Big brother, why are you here too? Is this the Underworld? I never did anything bad in life; why are they binding me?” Zhanbiao looked at Luo Tian.

“Idiot, you’ve got a big opportunity. Forge this lotus with your Soul Spirit; remember to refine it!” Luo Tian, seeing Zhanbiao still dazed, smiled and taught him how to absorb the lotus.

“Ah… Big brother, you forge it! I don’t want to refine this thing!” Zhanbiao smiled awkwardly, sensing the lotus was extraordinary and wanted to give it to Luo Tian.

“Idiot, only you can refine this Soul Seed. Stay here and wait until it’s done; your strength will surge significantly!” Luo Tian smiled, issuing a strict command.

“Okay, I’ll listen to big brother’s advice!” Zhanbiao grumbled, his face showing a bitter expression. He felt the time needed to fully refine the lotus would be long, an ordeal for him.

“Don’t leave until it’s done!” Luo Tian noticed Zhanbiao’s impatience and reiterated the command. He conveyed every detail he could think of to Zhanbiao before exiting Zhanbiao’s body.

“Hum…” Luo Tian opened his eyes again, a smile on his face. He stepped out of the hall.

“How was it?” As he exited, Man Hun’s tall figure appeared before him, his face filled with anticipation.

“Nothing major. However, Zhanbiao has a big opportunity; he needs to sleep for a while. When he awakens, his Soul Spirit will reach an terrifying level—perhaps even reaching the King’s realm!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice laced with anticipation.

“What?” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Man Hun’s face turned pale. He hadn’t expected Zhanbiao to have such a fortune. If Luo Tian’s words were true, Zhanbiao would become the top among Kings.

“I only said it might. Even if he doesn’t reach King’s realm, it won’t be far!” Luo Tian smiled, the gray lotus itself felt formidable. If he had absorbed it, his Soul Spirit would have surged a level.

“Finally, you’ve come out!” As Luo Tian and Man Hun conversed, a commanding voice echoed in his ears. A tall figure approached from afar—white-haired and shoulder-length, an old man’s appearance, yet his aura made Luo Tian’s eyes narrow with caution.

“Ah! The legendary Second-Life蛮族准王!” Luo Tian instantly recognized the old man’s identity.

“Unexpectedly, the renowned Luo Tian still remembers me!” Man Zhan smiled coldly, approaching Luo Tian. His heart slightly tensed; the current Luo Tian was terrifying compared to his peak era. Even with a second life, encountering Luo Tian still triggered an instinctual sense of danger.

“Congratulations, elder. You’ve lived a second life!” Luo Tian smiled politely and bowed respectfully.

“Don’t play games. Don’t try to flatter me, kid. According to the rules, I should kill you. But since you’ve helped our蛮族 greatly this time, I’ll let you go once. As for before, Sa Man’s agreement is erased!” Man Zhan scoffed, speaking to Luo Tian. Luo Tian’s face darkened.

Chapter 1690: Battle with the蛮王

“What?” Hearing Man Zhan’s words, Luo Tian’s face darkened. He hadn’t expected to be met with such a twist after preparing to leave.

“I said we won’t ally with you!” Man Zhan sneered, speaking coldly to Luo Tian.

“Elder, your words lack sense. We had already agreed with Sa Man. Why are you reneging? I have no hostility toward the蛮族, and my brother is a King’s son of the蛮族. He grew up among humans. Do you think he’ll lead the蛮族 to attack our Four Sacred Starfields?” Luo Tian’s face turned cold, his gaze on Man Zhan.

He had already been polite enough. Though Man Zhan had nearly killed him before, Luo Tian had also almost died in that battle. He was still polite to Man Zhan, which was already generous.

“Kid, stop the nonsense. Anyway, I won’t agree to what happened before. Do you think many in our蛮族 would accept it?” Man Zhan remained cold.

“Elder, this needs careful consideration. For our蛮族, it’s not a bad thing. Right now, the Four Sacred Starfields are thriving…” Man Hun saw Luo Tian and Man Zhan’s conversation growing tense, interjected to advise.

“Indeed, let’s discuss it carefully!” Old Sa Man approached from afar, his face troubled. He had already agreed, but Man Zhan’s reversal made him feel guilty toward Luo Tian.

“You two must be brainwashed by this kid. Now, the Ancient Clans are strong. There are eight great beings who’ve lived a second life alone. Do we fear this tiny human race?” Man Zhan smiled confidently.

“Haha, the Ancient Clans were also strong. There were many peaks and Kings then. But what happened?” Luo Tian sneered, despising the Ancient Clans’ arrogance.

“Perhaps when they attack again, humans might produce more great beings. Even a peak master could emerge!” Luo Tian mocked, his confidence evident.

“You…” Luo Tian’s mention of the last battle made Man Zhan recall the pressure Luo Tian and his companions had brought. His eyes flashed with coldness toward Luo Tian.

“Kid, I won’t give you another chance. If you want an alliance, fight me and win. Otherwise, no deal!” Man Zhan’s eyes shifted, then spoke to Luo Tian.

Hearing Man Zhan’s words, Sa Man and Man Hun’s faces turned red. Man Zhan was a great being who had lived a second life. Though Luo Tian was strong, they didn’t believe he could defeat Man Zhan. Even if Luo Tian had escaped from Qi Hongrui and others, it didn’t mean he could match a second-life great being.

“This is too much!” Sa Man muttered, his gaze on Man Zhan, feeling embarrassed.

“I’m not bullying him. A hundred blows—just survive a hundred against me, and I’ll agree!” Man Zhan said after considering.

“Our蛮族 has always valued strength. Only by winning our respect through martial power can you speak to us!” Man Zhan, after Sa Man’s words, thought for a moment before gazing at Luo Tian.

“A hundred blows!” Though it seemed like a concession, both Sa Man and Man Hun knew it was no different from none. At their level, victory or defeat happened in an instant. If one lost a single blow, it was hard to recover.

“Fine!” However, soon after, Luo Tian’s voice resolutely agreed. His tone was full of confidence.

“Did you really dare to agree?” Man Hun, hearing Luo Tian’s words, showed shock. He didn’t know where Luo Tian got such confidence.

But if Qi Hongrui and others were here, they wouldn’t think Luo Tian was arrogant. They knew Luo Tian’s battle strength was terrifying.

“Brave kid!” Man Zhan, seeing Luo Tian had no hesitation in agreeing, showed admiration. Indeed, Luo Tian was a peerless talent from any perspective.

“Let’s go!” Man Zhan then spoke, his body flickering into the蛮神殿. Their battle couldn’t be in the蛮族 continent, as it would cause too much damage.

“Hmph!” Luo Tian nodded. Since he had agreed, there was nothing more to say. He followed Man Zhan toward the蛮神殿.

“Sigh…” Sa Man sighed deeply, his eyes filled with nostalgia. He recalled the battle of the蛮 King and human reincarnate on Duan Shen Cliff, still recorded in the蛮族.

“Unexpectedly, I can now witness a human reincarnate battling our蛮族’s great being!” Old Sa Man spoke softly, then followed Man Hun into the depths of the蛮神殿.

The four entered the蛮神殿, reaching a large hall’s door. Man Zhan pushed it open and stepped inside. Luo Tian and the others followed closely, their presence causing a ripple.

“Come on! Let me see what you’ve got!” Man Zhan stood in the starry void, his battle spirit rising. He gazed at Luo Tian’s powerful aura, pressing it toward him.

“Not much to boast about. But a hundred blows for me aren’t too hard!” Luo Tian’s aura rose as well, clashing with Man Zhan’s.

“Hum…” The two invisible auras collided, emitting continuous humming. As the auras clashed, waves of wind blew against their bodies.

“Good!” Man Zhan took a step forward. His overwhelming aura became stronger, like waves of storm after wave, pressing toward Luo Tian.

“Manifesting the World!” Luo Tian’s hands formed a seal. His body expanded violently, glowing golden. He adjusted his state to the peak and took a step forward. Invisible waves continuously resisted Man Zhan’s pressing aura.

“Boom… Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed. Though they hadn’t attacked yet, they had already started their contest.

Their distance grew closer, speed faster. Each step caused the starry void to tremble. The stars began to shake around them, as if two supreme warriors, making the entire void dim.

“Truly strong!” Sa Man and Man Hun’s faces showed amazement. They watched Luo Tian, who was solemnly approaching Man Zhan, and were amazed that he hadn’t lost to Man Zhan in the battle of will.

“Kill…” As Sa Man and Man Hun were amazed, both Luo Tian and Man Zhan spoke at the same time. Their massive bodies surged forward, instantly becoming two streaks of light. Even Sa Man and Man Hun were momentarily stunned.

“Crack…” A thunderous sound echoed in the starry void. Two golden fists collided, black stars cracked.

After the thunder, both Luo Tian and Man Zhan’s figures retreated. Man Zhan’s face finally showed a hint of seriousness, sensing Luo Tian’s difficulty.

“This is the first blow!” Luo Tian smiled, feeling his arm numb. He spoke to Man Zhan.

“Brave kid!” Man Zhan laughed loudly, then took another step forward. His body rushed toward Luo Tian.

The thunderous sound echoed again. The two clashed another fist, their figures retreating again. This time, however, Luo Tian retreated further. He sighed inwardly.

“Great beings who’ve lived a second life are truly powerful. Fortunately, the蛮族 excels in physical strength, and my body is also变态!”

“This is the second blow!” However, Luo Tian’s face still showed a smile. He clenched his fists and rushed toward Man Zhan.

“Good!” Man Zhan, seeing Luo Tian rushing toward him, showed a hint of excitement. His feet moved slightly, meeting the rising aura of Luo Tian.

The thunderous sound echoed endlessly. The next moment, both clashed in the starry void, their sounds of collision echoing throughout it, as if they would shatter the entire small world.

“Third… fifth…” Old Sa Man and Man Hun stood in the trembling starry void, counting their clash. The wild winds continuously swept over them.

Golden fist shadows danced around Luo Tian and Man Zhan, dazzling the eyes. Even Sa Man and Man Hun found it hard to keep up.

“This kid… after so many years, he’s become this strong!” Old Sa Man sighed. Though he had known Luo Tian would be strong, seeing it with his own eyes still shocked him.

“Fifty…” Luo Tian roared, clashing another fist with Man Zhan. His body retreated, his arms covered in cracks. He stood in the starry void, wiping blood from his mouth.

“Kid, you’re really good!” Man Zhan’s hands were also covered in cracks. His gaze toward Luo Tian changed slightly. The previous clash had shown no signs of weakness. He was a second-life great being, and ordinary kings would be crushed by him.

“Continue!” Luo Tian spoke calmly. While talking, he quickly recovered his state. He knew the real battle was coming.

“Good!” Man Zhan smiled slightly, not caring about Luo Tian’s thoughts. His aura rose again, his body expanding.

“God of the蛮神 Stomping Nine Heavens!” Man Zhan’s deep voice echoed. At the same time, a golden foot stomped through all realms, pressing toward Luo Tian.

“Is this the seventh stomp of the蛮?” Luo Tian smiled, watching the golden foot pressing toward him. His face showed no fear. He took another step forward.

Chapter 1691: A Hundred Blows

In the small world of the蛮神殿, two golden feet collided with a thunderous sound. The golden leg shadows collapsed into terrifying winds that swept outward.

Luo Tian’s body trembled violently, retreating. His body rapidly healed the fine cracks on it.

“God of the蛮神 Stomping Again! Shattering Stars!” Man Zhan stood still, his aura swallowing the heavens. He took another step forward, pressing toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian stopped his body, watching the earth-shaking golden foot. His eyes flashed with seriousness. He marveled at the strength of a second-life great being. He took another step forward, clashing with the seventh stomp.

The thunderous sound echoed again. Two golden feet collided in Sa Man and old Man Hun’s sight.

The vast starry void began to collapse. Golden epoch power transformed into a powerful aura, submerging the vast starry void. Luo Tian’s figure retreated again, blood spilling from his mouth. His massive body shattered several stars before stopping.

“God of the蛮神 Third Stomp, Scaring Gods!” Without giving Luo Tian a chance to catch his breath, Man Zhan’s golden foot took another step. He didn’t give Luo Tian any breathing space. The golden foot, covered with complex蛮 patterns, pressed toward the blood-spitting Luo Tian.

“Kid, you’re really strong. But you still live too short a time. Though you’ve mastered the seventh stomp well, it’s not enough against absolute strength!” Man Zhan looked down from above, his body glowing. He watched Luo Tian’s pitiful state.

“This is the fifty-third blow!” Luo Tian roared, taking his third step. He clashed with Man Zhan’s golden foot again.

“Crack…” No surprise, Luo Tian’s body retreated again. His flesh emitted a crackling sound. His massive body looked like a bloodied man, shrinking in Sa Man’s eyes.

“Still not enough. Though Luo Tian is strong, he still can’t handle the old ancestor!” Man Hun sighed, watching the bloodied Luo Tian return to view.

“This kid’s strength, if he met a second-life great being, could escape easily. But in real combat, it’s still insufficient!”

“However, it’s not over yet. Don’t judge too soon; this kid has many tricks!” Old Sa Man spoke softly, his gaze on Luo Tian’s rising aura.

“Truly tenacious kid. But I must warn you, the next one could be life-threatening. It’s still not too late to surrender!” Man Zhan, with admiration in his eyes, looked at Luo Tian. If it weren’t for prejudice, this kid was worth respecting. After all, few could face him with a King’s realm cultivation.

Moreover, Man Zhan had heard the most about Luo Tian recently. He had escaped from Qi Hongrui and others’ pursuit, even killing one. In such a desperate situation, even he would find it hard to escape.

“Again!” But the answer was another golden foot and a determined voice.

“Good!” Man Zhan roared, taking the fourth step forward. He clashed with Luo Tian again.

“Fifth… sixth…” Three thunderous sounds echoed throughout the small world, stars swirling into chaos.

Three clashes left Luo Tian severely wounded. Yet each time, he rebounded like an indestructible superpower, clashing with Man Zhan again.

“This is the final step. Kid, are you sure to accept it?” Man Zhan’s body was also covered in fine cracks. Though he was better than Luo Tian, Luo Tian’s attacks had cost him too.

“Luo Tian, let’s call it a day!” Sa Man and Man Hun urged Luo Tian. Their voices carried persuasion. They knew if the seventh stomp of the蛮 was fully unleashed, the final step would be the most terrifying. They feared Man Zhan and Luo Tian might accidentally injure each other, which would be a loss.

“God of the蛮神 Seven Stomps, Shattering Eternity!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed. The梵天攻杀术 and the one-force-over-all-methods were added to his golden foot, carrying a world-destroying aura. It shattered the path of time, pressing toward Man Zhan.

“Good, I’ll grant you. If you die, don’t blame me!” Man Zhan’s face changed upon seeing the world-destroying aura. His eyes showed intense fear, sensing a strong threat from the golden foot.

“This…” Sa Man and Man Hun’s faces were filled with shock. They saw a golden mountain-like foot, feeling they would be crushed if stepped on.

The hum echoed. Man Zhan, facing Luo Tian’s strongest attack, didn’t dare to be careless. He also used his full strength, taking the seventh stomp of the蛮.

“Boom…” The next moment, two golden feet collided. A thunderous sound echoed in Sa Man and Man Hun’s ears, making them instantly lose hearing. Their faces turned pale.

Time seemed to stop. In Sa Man and Man Hun’s shocked gaze, two golden feet continuously destroyed each other. Infinite power spread out, sweeping through the vast starry void.

The entire starry void dimmed. Under this power’s sweep, stars turned into fragments, annihilated by the collision’s afterglow.

Vast gray void currents surged from the shattered starry void, dispersing waves. A massive figure stood there, drenched in blood, trembling violently. His eyes showed shock.

“Where is Luo Tian?” Sa Man and Man Hun stood within a conjured barrier. They immediately recognized the massive figure as Man Zhan, but didn’t see Luo Tian’s presence.

“There!” They then saw a smaller figure compared to Man Zhan, floating in the starry void. Blood continuously flowed from its tiny body.

“Kid, you’ve no more strength left, right?” Man Zhan’s eyes showed fatigue. He looked at the small figure and spoke softly.

“This is the fifty-seventh blow!” Luo Tian, his face pale, looked at Man Zhan. His voice was hoarse. He felt his current state was extremely poor, with his body on the verge of collapse.

“Hum…” Waves spread from Luo Tian’s body. Green vitality surrounded his grotesque wounds.

“You! Still want to continue? You should know your current state. If you keep fighting, you’ll die!” Man Zhan’s face changed upon hearing Luo Tian’s words. He could feel Luo Tian’s current state was extremely weak.

But soon, Man Zhan’s eyes narrowed. Under this green vitality, Luo Tian’s grotesque wounds were rapidly healing.

“What? It healed so fast!” Man Zhan and the others showed surprise. They couldn’t believe Luo Tian’s body was so变态, its recovery speed terrifying.

“It’s the Life-Reviving Ice Spirit Powder!” Sa Man and Man Hun showed realization. They recalled Luo Tian had previously taken an immortal herb.

“Again!” Luo Tian roared, his hands moving swiftly. A golden vortex formed above his head. Golden seals continuously drew in unknown power, spreading a terrifying pressure.

“Hum…” The next moment, the golden seal collapsed space, pressing toward Man Zhan.

“Then again!” Man Zhan’s face showed seriousness. His injuries were severe, but he still rushed toward the golden seal with his feet.

A golden fist rose suddenly. Simple as it was, it carried a massive aura.

“Pang…” A dull sound echoed again. The golden seal shattered in Luo Tian’s slightly weakened gaze, dispersing into divine laws that swept over Man Zhan.

“Divine King’s Nine Heavens Map!” Luo Tian moved his hands, and the golden divine map fell again with heavy energy. It didn’t let Man Zhan catch his breath.

“Kid, there’s no use in resisting!” Man Zhan spat blood but his eyes glowed with intense light. He raised his hands to block the Divine King’s Nine Heavens Map.

“Exactly what I wanted!” Seeing Man Zhan’s move, Luo Tian’s pale lips slightly curled. He pointed his finger.

“Eight Directions of Treasure Falling!” A wave surged from his finger, invisible divine laws wrapping around the massive divine map.

At the same time, the golden map, like a blazing sun, smashed onto Man Zhan’s hands. A crackling sound echoed again in the starry void.

“Crack… Crack…” Man Zhan roared, his white hair flying. His massive body dragged the Divine King’s Nine Heavens Map, creating a breathtaking scene.

“Crack… Crack…” But crackling sounds echoed from Man Zhan’s arms. The massive map, with Man Zhan’s body, continuously fell.

“Pang…” A thick arm, like two heavenly pillars, finally couldn’t withstand the pressure. It was destroyed by the massive map, turning into two clouds of blood floating in the starry void.

Without arm support, the Divine King’s Nine Heavens Map’s power decreased. But it still smashed onto Man Zhan’s head, making him feel dizzy.

“Manifesting the World!” Luo Tian saw Man Zhan wounded and smiled. His body expanded again.

“King’s Battle Technique!” Luo Tian bent his body, then overturned the starry void. He rushed toward Man Zhan.

Chapter 1692: I’ve Lived Long Enough

“Ah…” Seeing Luo Tian rushing toward him, Man Zhan’s face turned extremely grim. His anger was intense. His arms had just started regenerating.

“Embarrassing!” Man Zhan’s first feeling was embarrassment. He hadn’t expected his first battle after living a second life to be so desperate, and it was Luo Tian who had made him so. Most infuriating of all, his cultivation was clearly higher than Luo Tian’s.

Originally, Man Zhan had thought he would dominate this kid. Though Luo Tian felt dangerous, from his heart, he had underestimated him. He hadn’t expected to be pushed into such a situation by his carelessness.

Before Man Zhan’s arms could regenerate, Luo Tian’s powerful figure rushed toward him. The Dao of Sealing Magic combined with the梵天攻杀 and One Force Over All Methods struck Man Zhan’s body repeatedly.

“Damn!” Man Zhan felt his arm regeneration speed. His face darkened, then he bit his teeth and stopped one arm from regenerating. His right hand quickly regenerated, colliding with Luo Tian before his fist landed on him.

“This is the sixtieth blow!” Luo Tian punched, then didn’t care about the result. He couldn’t relax; this was his only chance to survive a hundred blows against Man Zhan.

“Pang… Pang… Pang…” Thus, Luo Tian used all his strength. He pushed his speed and power to the limit, repeatedly striking Man Zhan with one arm.

The determined Luo Tian was terrifying. Combined with the King’s Battle Technique and two great arts, his strength could inflict serious damage on a second-life powerhouse.

Man Zhan was furious but couldn’t resist Luo Tian’s speed. His wounded body also struggled to defend.

“Has the old ancestor been suppressed!” Man Hun’s face showed disbelief. He watched Luo Tian striking repeatedly, never expecting such a result.

“Just temporary suppression,” Sa Man said with a sigh. He spoke softly.

Hearing Sa Man’s words, Man Hun stared at the punches Luo Tian threw. He couldn’t help but take a deep breath.

Though Luo Tian temporarily suppressed Man Zhan, he also felt extremely uncomfortable. After all, Man Zhan’s body wasn’t easily broken. He felt like he was hitting an iron plate.

Blood flowed from Luo Tian’s fists, but he didn’t stop. If he did, giving Man Zhan a chance to recover would mean his defeat.

“Sixty-first… sixty-fifth…” Luo Tian’s voice echoed in the starry void. Man Zhan’s body continuously retreated, hearing Luo Tian count each move. His heart grew anxious.
