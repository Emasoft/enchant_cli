Not only Long Jie but every disciple of the Tongtian Sect was panting heavily, collapsing to the ground with cold sweat streaming down their faces, their gazes filled with relief. Even Luo Tian was no different; his eyes revealed a hint of relief. The matter had been resolved perfectly, and Luo Tian felt much better.

The next step was to absorb the forces of the Golden Toad Sect under Tongtian's control, allowing him to traverse the entire Fire Domain in search of Chen Yunting. Luo Tian quickly set his course of action.

After catching their breath, they looked at one another, then burst into laughter, gradually rising to their feet. Their gazes turned toward Luo Tian, who stood atop the sky, awaiting his words.

"Good, everyone. You remained with Tongtian during its most desperate time. Trust in me, Luo Tian. Trust the Grand Master. Trust the Senior Elder. Since we've overcome this trial, it's now time to reap the fruits of our victory. For now, rest yourselves. Tomorrow at dawn, we shall march toward the Golden Toad Sect. From today forward, the Fire Domain's three great sects will include Tongtian!" Luo Tian's voice rang out, echoing through the heavens and resounding across the world.

"Hah! Finally, we can hold our heads high. I wonder what those scum who refused to join Tongtian will say now!" The crowd laughed heartily, their eyes brimming with boundless reverence and excitement.

The Three Great Sects! Among the attendees, most were unaware of how Gu Tian had once ruled the Fire Domain. Yet they knew the unparalleled status these three sects held within it.

That night, every disciple of Tongtian was lost in exhilaration, awaiting the dawn.

At sunrise the next day, disciples of Tongtian appeared in the sky with clear minds and refreshed spirits, waiting for Luo Tian's arrival.

"Let's go!" After a night of recovery and the restoration provided by sacred pills, Luo Tian had regained his strength. He led the disciples of Tongtian toward the former Three Great Sects—the Golden Toad Sect.

Half a day later, an announcement spread across the Fire Domain: Tongtian's forces had launched a preemptive attack on the Golden Toad Sect.

This news was met with scorn. After all, how could the Golden Toad Sect, one of the Three Great Sects, be comparable to a mere sect like Tongtian?

Yet three days later, an explosive revelation spread across the Fire Domain. Lu Han and the disciples of the Flame Observance Sect, along with Du Hongtao's forces from the Sea-Storm Pavilion, had arrived to aid Tongtian in attacking the Golden Toad Sect. In the end, the Golden Toad Sect was completely overthrown, and all its forces were absorbed by Tongtian. From that moment on, Tongtian officially became the third great sect of the Fire Domain.

Yet at this point, Luo Tian was leisurely strolling through the Fire Domain with Long Jie aboard an ancient warship, wandering without purpose.

After conquering the Golden Toad Sect, Luo Tian took a hands-off approach, no longer concerning himself with Tongtian's affairs. He continued his search for Chen Yunting, even scouring the Sea-Storm Pavilion and Flame Observance Sect without success.

"Ah..." Luo Tian sighed, rubbing his head in frustration. He gazed at the final continent before him. Though he had prepared for this, disappointment still lingered.

"Alright, since the Fire Domain has no more traces of her, let's first return to the Four Sacred Stars and bring back the Gu family to reunite with their ancestors," Luo Tian said with a light laugh, his gaze turning toward the Four Sacred Stars.

"Buzz..." At the moment Luo Tian made this decision, his token at his waist emitted a series of tremors, causing his eyes to flash with intense light.

"Beast Domain!" Luo Tian spoke only two words, and Long Jie's expression turned slightly uneasy.

Chapter 920: Departing for the Beast Domain

In the Hall of Tongtian Sect, the atmosphere was solemn. New Grand Master Wang Xuanyang and Senior Elder Song Yongkang of the Super-Immortal realm sat together with other high-ranking disciples of Tongtian.

Lu Tianyu of the Flame Observance Sect sat calmly on a luxurious chair, exuding an air of detachment. Wang Xuanyang and Song Yongkang exchanged glances in silent approval. Indeed, Lu Tianyu was the prodigy of the Flame Observance Sect and the current top talent of the Fire Domain.

However, Lu Tianyu was referred to as the top talent of the Fire Domain only because Luo Tian's strength had surpassed even the Grand Masters of the Three Great Sects. Comparing himself to Luo Tian was akin to bullying, and in people's hearts, Luo Tian had long ceased to be considered a youth.

"Uncle Lu, when will you return? This incident in the Beast Domain must surely interest you!" Lu Tianyu smiled, sipping tea with a touch of excitement.

"Very soon. We've already informed Luo Tian; he's on his way back. He should arrive at the Tongtian Continent today. Whether he comes or not, though, is up to his decision," Wang Xuanyang said solemnly, gazing at Lu Tianyu.

Three days ago, Lu Tianyu had delivered a significant message to Tongtian on behalf of the Flame Observance Sect and Sea-Storm Pavilion. This news had shaken all nine domains, as a place once thought to be legend had appeared in the Beast Domain. This made the Beast Domain the center of attention.

As a neighboring domain to the Fire Domain, the Fire Domain was ranked second-to-last in strength. However, they received the news not too late. Upon receiving it, Lu Han and Du Hongtao had hastily discussed.

Yet as a newly established great sect, Tongtian had been consolidating its strength and received no news until Lu Tianyu's arrival. Wang Xuanyang and Song Yongkang only then learned of the massive event in the Beast Domain.

The Ancient Palace, also known as the Tomb of Sages, had appeared within the Beast Domain's Holy City. This revelation was explosive.

Among the nine domains, except for the Four Sacred Stars, all others knew of the Ancient Palace's name. This was because legends spoke of a secret to ascending to the Epoch Realm hidden within it, causing countless Sages to go mad with desire.

Yet every time the Ancient Palace appeared, nine domains' Sage-level warriors flooded in. Yet none had ever emerged. Over time, the Ancient Palace became infamous with the saying "Ancient Palace Traps Sages; Sages' Tombs." However, each time the Ancient Palace opened, only those at the Sage-beginner or Super-Immortal levels could enter. Those with higher cultivation who touched its restrictions would be either severely injured or crushed to death.

Even Sages at the peak of their power could not approach it. The moment they did, they were repelled and unable to enter. It was quite sinister.

Yet despite this, every time the Ancient Palace opened, countless Sage-beginners and Super-Immortals flocked to it, lured by the chance of a meteoric rise.

"Buzz..." A tremor spread as a black ancient warship appeared outside the Tongtian Continent. Standing on it were Luo Tian and Long Jie.

Luo Tian had intended to return to the Four Sacred Stars to fetch the Gu family and reunite with Gu Tianshu, but upon arriving, he received a message from Wang Xuanyang and Song Yongkang.

Luo Tian had spent considerable time in the Fire Domain. He was well aware of the legendary Ancient Palace, and such an opportunity to enhance his strength naturally intrigued him. After all, Gu Tianshu had once said that if Luo Tian reached the Epoch Realm, he could combine with the Buddha's Attack to break through Gu Tianshu's restrictions and the barrier beneath Tongtian Mountain.

Additionally, it was for Long Jie. Luo Tian felt that Long Jie could gain significant benefits in the Beast Domain, benefits so immense they bordered on miraculous.

Thus, Luo Tian delayed his journey, intending to first visit the Ancient Palace. Yet he was no fool; he knew the Ancient Palace's long-standing reputation. Though he was a Sage-beginner prodigy, he had no certainty of success. If the Ancient Palace proved too dangerous, Luo Tian believed his life was more important.

Moreover, since there were no traces of Chen Yunting in the Fire Domain, Luo Tian's next destination was the Beast Domain to the south of the Fire Domain. Thus, regardless of perspective, he had to go to the Beast Domain—only his departure was earlier than planned.

He stowed the black warship and smiled, gently patting Long Jie's head as he pondered. They shared a mutual understanding; Luo Tian knew what Long Jie was thinking: "Don't overthink it. Everything will be clear once we reach the Beast Domain."

With that, he and Long Jie transformed into a streak of light, plunging into the Tongtian Continent and appearing at the base of Tongtian Mountain.

Seeing Luo Tian and Long Jie, the disciples of Tongtian would not block them. They quickly informed Luo Tian of Lu Tianyu's arrival and led him to the grand hall where Wang Xuanyang and others awaited.

"Luo Tian!" Upon seeing Luo Tian, the people in the hall stood up. Though they called his name aloud, their eyes were filled with reverence. Even Lu Tianyu bore a look of admiration and respect.

"Luo Xiong, I'm late. Apologies!" Luo Tian bowed to Lu Tianyu, speaking softly without looking down on him despite his higher cultivation. He knew Lu Tianyu's talent was nearly equal to his own, though his luck had been slightly worse.

"Luo Xiong, since you've arrived, it's settled. Do you wish to join us from the Flame Observance Sect and Sea-Storm Pavilion in heading to the Beast Domain?" Lu Tianyu spoke directly, his intent clear—to invite Luo Tian to accompany their sects.

Hearing Lu Tianyu's words, Luo Tian pondered for a moment before nodding. After all, he had never visited the Beast Domain before, and Tongtian was a newly risen sect with no knowledge of it. Traveling together with the Sea-Storm Pavilion and Flame Observance Sect was a good opportunity.

"Good, then I'll trouble you!" Luo Tian smiled and bowed to Lu Tianyu.

"Good. Then I'll return and inform my master. We'll depart for the Beast Domain in three days. However, Luo Xiong, I must warn you: the Beast Domain is unlike the Fire Domain. Beasts' strength is unfathomable, and there are other domain's warriors as well. We should try to stay low-key. Other domains do look down on the Fire Domain and Four Sacred Stars," Lu Tianyu said with a bitter expression, addressing Luo Tian. Though he had spent little time with Luo Tian, he understood his temperament.

Seeing the look in Luo Tian's eyes, Lu Tianyu knew Luo Tian likely took his words as nonsense.

This left Lu Tianyu helpless. He could only smile and depart from Tongtian Sect, as preparations for the Beast Domain were still needed.

"You two should stay and handle matters at Tongtian. The sect has just been established, and there are many tasks to complete," Luo Tian mused for a moment before deciding that Long Jie and he would go.

Though Wang Xuanyang and Song Yongkang were concerned, they knew that even if the two went, they would be of little help. Moreover, there were too many tasks to handle at Tongtian.

After speaking with everyone, Luo Tian took flight and descended into the underground of Tongtian Sect, respectfully standing before Gu Tianshu.

"You're going to the Beast Domain and the Ancient Palace?" Gu Tianshu's aged face bore a trace of nostalgia as he addressed Luo Tian.

"Yes, Grandfather. Do you have any information about the Ancient Palace?" Luo Tian bowed respectfully and asked softly.

"Be careful. If you can't match them, return. When the Ancient Palace appeared, I was already at the Sage-peak level and thus could not enter. However, legends do have some falsehoods. I know that someone once entered the palace and emerged alive," Gu Tianshu said with a touch of reverence, his gaze tracing back to ancient times.

Hearing Gu Tianshu's words, Luo Tian was stunned. His gaze now carried deep reverence for Gu Tianshu. To be revered by the ancestor who had once looked down on Heaven's Path, one must be truly extraordinary. Luo Tian's curiosity was instantly piqued.

"Haha, you might not believe it, but the person who entered the palace and returned alive may be closely related to you. Far away yet near, it's right here—your companion, the little dragon! I don't know if it's true, but he truly resembles that ancient dragon very closely!" Gu Tianshu spoke softly, causing a tidal wave of emotions to rise within Luo Tian.

"Long Jie!" Luo Tian had never imagined that the person Gu Tianshu referred to was Long Jie. Yet Long Jie was only a few years old—how could he be an ancient strength from Gu Tianshu's era?

"Though I don't know what this little dragon has experienced over the years, my instincts are clear. Even if he's not that ancient dragon, he is closely related to it!" Gu Tianshu explained again.

"Alright, going or not, it's all up to you. Cultivation is cultivation of the heart; follow your heart," Gu Tianshu's aged voice echoed before he closed his eyes again.

Luo Tian said nothing, his eyes glowing with light. He bowed respectfully to Gu Tianshu: "With Long Jie, my chances are greater. What reason is there to not go? Cultivation requires courage; only those who shrink back can't become true masters of the era!"

Chapter 921: Arrival at the Beast Domain

Beyond the Sea-Storm Pavilion's starry sky, Luo Tian and Long Jie stood calmly, waiting for the disciples of the Sea-Storm Pavilion and Flame Observance Sect to arrive.

Three days had passed since they arrived at Tongtian. They had only stayed for a day before departing to the Sea-Storm Pavilion, where they were to meet with Lu Tianyu as agreed.

They had barely arrived when tremors rippled through the void. Lu Han and his disciple, Lu Tianyu, appeared before Luo Tian and Long Jie.

"Respect for the elder!" Luo Tian bowed to Lu Han, who was a disciple of Eastern纵横. In terms of hierarchy, Lu Han held a higher position than Luo Tian.

"Luo Tian, forget the elder titles. We're all family now; don't be formal!" Lu Han smiled warmly, helping Luo Tian up with admiration.

"Apologies. It seems we arrived the latest!" Du Hongtao's voice echoed, and behind him was Du Yuying with a solemn face. Her gaze turned to Luo Tian and Long Jie, flashing her small fangs with a desire to devour Long Jie.

Long Jie was no less defiant, letting out a cold snort and challenging: "Hmph. What's there to be proud of? Your father isn't even a match for my brother!"

"Who said your father isn't a match for me? My father is invincible!" Du Yuying, unaware of the incident where three Grand Masters had attacked Tongtian, scolded Long Jie loudly.

"Haha!" Long Jie laughed and said no more, turning his gaze to Du Hongtao with a playful expression.

Du Hongtao's face turned red, clearly touched by Long Jie's words. He looked at his daughter and was at a loss for what to say.

Du Yuying noticed Du Hongtao's expression, her face changing. She suddenly realized that a few days ago, when Du Hongtao returned with the Supreme Master of Sea-Storm Pavilion, his cultivation had plummeted and he looked pale—clearly wounded.

Since Du Hongtao's return, it had been announced that Jin Jingtian of the Golden Toad Sect was killed by Luo Tian, and Tongtian had entered the Three Great Sects.

Du Yuying wasn't foolish. She now fully understood that her father was not a match for Luo Tian, and her face turned red in embarrassment.

The atmosphere grew awkward. Seeing this, Luo Tian glared at Long Jie: "Don't speak nonsense. My fight with Du Elder was just a sparring match. We both ended up injured!"

"Haha, enough. Let's move on before we arrive too late and the Ancient Palace closes, making this trip a waste!" Lu Han quickly intervened to ease the tension, playing the role of a good-natured mediator.

Lu Tianyu stood still, his face carrying a bitter expression. Though Du Yuying was unaware of the incident, Lu Tianyu knew everything because Lu Han had recounted it all to him. He felt deep admiration for Luo Tian's evaluation of him.

Though Lu Han had mediated, the group was awkwardly on their way. Each group had not brought many people—after all, it was the Ancient Palace, a domain considered the strongest of nine.

Six people traveled swiftly. In just three days, they reached the southernmost end of the Fire Domain—the border with the Beast Domain.

A vast golden barrier appeared before them. Even Luo Tian, upon facing this powerful barrier, felt a sense of helplessness.

"This barrier was set by an unknown sage. It isolates the Beast Domain's northern Fire Domain and southern Thunder Domain, preventing others from entering the Beast Domain."

"The Beast Domain is unlike other domains. It's a paradise for beasts, where humans have no chance of survival. Even Supreme-level humans would be mercilessly slaughtered by beasts unless they are at the Super-Immortal level, who can survive in the Beast Domain. The Beast Domain respects strength; if you're a Super-Immortal and don't attack beasts, you'll be safe."

"But once you attack a beast, the entire clan will hunt you relentlessly until death!" Du Hongtao explained to them about the Beast Domain's rules.

"Additionally, the Beast Domain is unlike other domains. It's divided into factions. The entire Beast Domain has only one ruler—the Holy City of the Beasts, the capital of the beast clan! The Holy City is governed by eight great clans. It's said these eight clans are united without any discord," Lu Han added, his gaze turning to Long Jie beside Luo Tian.

"Which clans are the eight great Beast Clans?" Luo Tian asked, his voice soft as he noticed Lu Tianyu's hesitation.

"Dragon Clan, Phoenix Clan, Peng Clan, Tiger Clan, Bear Clan..." Lu Tianyu listed the eight great Beast Clans of the Beast Domain, placing the Dragon Clan at the forefront.

"You're this dragon's younger brother. His dragon blood is so rich; he might be a member of the Beast Domain's Dragon Clan. I'm confused—how did you end up with him?" Lu Tianyu asked, his face showing some confusion.

Luo Tian's brows furrowed deeply. Upon hearing Lu Tianyu's account, he too felt deep doubts. The eight great Beast Clans Lu Tianyu described were clearly an expansion of the Great An Forest, as the Great An Forest also had these races as its rulers. The only difference was that the Phoenix Clan wasn't present in the Great An Forest.

"Seems the problem might lie with the Phoenix Clan," Luo Tian mused, gently rubbing his lower lip.

Long Jie's eyes were filled with confusion but also anticipation. He had a feeling this trip to the Beast Domain would resolve all his doubts.

"Enough thinking. Elders, how do we enter this Beast Domain?" Luo Tian patted Long Jie's shoulder and asked Du Hongtao and Lu Han.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, the four of them—Du Hongtao, Lu Han, and their companions—exchanged glances with admiration. Lu Han spoke softly: "This is thanks to Grandmaster Gu Tianshu!"

"Grandmaster Gu Tianshu, as the first in the Fire Domain to reach Sage-peak level, was full of ambition. A single Fire Domain could not satisfy Grandmaster Gu Tianshu. As a neighboring domain, the Beast Domain was his top choice. With unparalleled power, he shattered part of this barrier and opened a passage between the Beast Domain and Fire Domain. This truly shocked the beasts' Holy City. To show respect for a strong warrior, the beast clan decided not to repair this entrance and allowed Fire Domain's Super-Immortals and above to enter the Beast Domain," Lu Han said, causing Luo Tian's heart to tremble again. Gu Tianshu was truly astonishing.

Under Lu Han's guidance, they quickly found the entrance Grandmaster Gu Tianshu had opened. A passage capable of accommodating a thousand people appeared before them, starkly contrasting with the golden barrier. The surrounding area still bore faint cracks, revealing Grandmaster Gu Tianshu's immense power.

"Let's go. Enter the Beast Domain, and we should stay low-key. If we meet other domain's warriors, try not to offend them," Lu Han reiterated before rushing in first.

Du Hongtao and the others followed closely. Luo Tian and Long Jie, their faces filled with anticipation, walked behind them into the third-ranked domain of nine—the Beast Domain.

"Buzz..." Tremors spread. Luo Tian felt a brief dizziness, then a refreshing sensation flooded his mind, making him feel refreshed.

However, immediately after, a strong beastly aura locked onto them. Four glimmers of light made Luo Tian's group tense.

"You're from the Fire Domain, really rare guests. The Fire Domain hasn't had anyone come to our Beast Domain in a long time!" A deep voice echoed in their ears.

Before them stood two men with upper bodies, both identical in appearance. Their muscles were bulging, each holding a massive wolf-tooth club and scrutinizing Luo Tian's group.

"Three Sages!" One of the men saw that Luo Tian's group were at the Sage-beginner level and showed no fear.

"Super-Immortals?" Luo Tian frowned, surprised that the two gatekeepers were at the Super-Immortal level.

But soon after, Luo Tian noticed the piles of white bones and skulls scattered behind them, forming a mountain-like heap.

"Haha, these are people from the Fire Domain and Four Sacred Stars who didn't know their place. They dared to sneak into our Beast Domain without weighing their worth. Tiny Supreme-level warriors dare to come here!" The two men spoke in unison, their voices overlapping as if one person had spoken.

Though aware that the Beast Domain looked down on the Fire Domain, Luo Tian hadn't expected it to this extent. Simply entering the Beast Domain had resulted in being killed, and Luo Tian felt slightly annoyed.

"Alright, your strength is acceptable. You may enter our Beast Domain, but you must not harm our companions or show disrespect to the Holy City. Otherwise, you'll face the wrath of our beast clan's masters. I advise you not to seek the Ancient Palace; don't risk your lives!" The two men spoke in unison, warning Luo Tian's group.

"Thank you," Lu Han said. Though he felt some irritation, these two men were merely people he could easily kill. However, Lu Han couldn't risk it; if he killed them, it would be like poking a wasp's nest.

The two men nodded and allowed Luo Tian's group to enter. However, Luo Tian felt a tremor behind him, causing his face to slightly surprise.

The entire Fire Domain only knew about the Ancient Palace's news through Luo Tian and his group. Yet, there were clearly people arriving at the Beast Domain behind them—this made Luo Tian cautious.

Figures appeared before the two men, and their eyes flashed with a bloodthirsty gleam: "Haha! The Nine-Origin Supreme Sage, finally able to kill again!"

Luo Tian saw the newcomers and wore a mix of surprise and joy, instantly rushing toward them.

"Luo Tian! Haha, we've missed you so much! I want to tell you something..." The group was startled by Luo Tian's rush, then exclaimed with joy upon seeing it was Luo Tian.

Chapter 922: Headache

At the Beast Domain's entrance, Luo Tian wore a mix of surprise and joy, his eyes filled with smiles as he gazed at the familiar figures before him.

"Luo Tian! We've missed you so much! Did you miss us? Haha, I never thought we'd meet here!" A deep voice echoed before a robust figure appeared in front of Luo Tian.

"Haha, what a coincidence! This time, we should talk for three days and nights!" A playful voice echoed as well, causing Luo Tian's head to throb.

"Exactly! Without you, we were really bored!" The figures surrounded Luo Tian, speaking in unison with joy.

But Luo Tian's face turned grim. Seeing the people rushing toward him, he sighed and patted his head.

"Stop... stop... stop..." Luo Tian said repeatedly. The group finally stopped talking, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Why did you come to the Beast Domain?" Luo Tian asked with a helpless expression, looking at the group before him. These people were none other than Gu Lei, Zheng Xin, Xu Liyi, Tian Luo, Chen Zhanbiao, and Shao Luo, along with other top talents from the Four Sacred Stars who were close to Luo Tian. Also present was Nan Gong Yuqing, leader of the Star River Four Thieves, and Li Tianzhi, as well as Wan Lingkong.

Luo Tian never expected to meet these familiar faces at the Beast Domain's entrance, which filled him with immense joy.

"Haha, let's find a place to talk. This isn't the right spot!" Gu Lei smiled and patted Luo Tian's shoulder.

The group spoke in unison, though it wasn't the right place to talk. They still kept talking, making Luo Tian's head throb.

"Alright, let's go!" Luo Tian sighed again, knowing if these talkative people started talking, they wouldn't stop.

Luo Tian spoke and led Zheng Xin and Gu Lei toward Du Hongtao's group, intending to enter the Beast Domain for further discussion.

But as Luo Tian took a step forward, a rough voice echoed: "Nine-Origin Supreme Sage? You dare to enter the Beast Domain? Die!" Two beastly men guarding the entrance appeared before them, their wolf-tooth clubs aimed at Chen Zhanbiao and Wan Lingkong.

The two guards were at the Super-Immortal level, their speed and power immense. The clubs instantly reached Chen Zhanbiao and Wan Lingkong's heads, causing them to tense.

Though the two guards were at the Super-Immortal level, they couldn't harm Chen Zhanbiao and Wan Lingkong in front of Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's face changed, his eyes instantly sharp. Like two lightning bolts, he rushed into the minds of the two guards, causing them to stop abruptly.

"You dare interfere with our Beast Domain!" They both spoke at once, their voices filled with anger. They didn't regard Luo Tian's Sage-beginner level as anything and demanded an explanation.

Though the two guards were stopped by Luo Tian's aura, Chen Zhanbiao didn't care. Over the years, Chen Zhanbiao's body had become even more robust. His massive physique was no different from the two beastly men in human form, a living humanoid beast.

Chen Zhanbiao's mind was somewhat stubborn. Over the years, he had obtained a cultivation manual and managed to reach the Nine-Origin Supreme Sage level. Though his speed was fast, he had only reached this level due to short cultivation time.

Seeing someone attack him, Chen Zhanbiao's deep voice echoed like a thunderclap: "You want to hit me? I'll tear you apart!"

His words were followed by a heavy footstep, and he appeared before one of the guards. His hand shot out, grabbing the guard's arm.

"Ai..." Chen Zhanbiao growled, his thick arms bulging with veins. His arm was even thicker than Luo Tian's thigh. He exerted force, producing a series of cracking sounds.

"Luo Tian's eyes flashed with intense light. He looked at Chen Zhanbiao, filled with disbelief. Though he had known Chen Zhanbiao's body was strong, now it seemed even his own strength was a bit embarrassing.

"Clang..." The wolf-tooth club fell to the ground with a heavy sound. The guard, who was at the Super-Immortal level and even an animal of the Rhino Clan, had his face drenched in cold sweat. He was equally shocked by Chen Zhanbiao.

He was a Super-Immortal beast, his body naturally strong. He was also a Rhino Clan warrior known for strength.

Luo Tian was stunned, his aura instantly relaxed. The guard regained freedom.

"Kid, you're looking for death!" The guard who had been grabbed by Chen Zhanbiao felt his overwhelming aura vanish. His entire body was relieved, and he wore a fierce expression. With one hand, he launched a punch at Chen Zhanbiao's head.

"Haha! Good, good, good. Seems I can have fun again. It's been a long time since I had fun! Great!" Chen Zhanbiao remained calm, smiling with a foolish expression. He also swung his other hand.

"Boom..." A loud explosion echoed in the void, two black fists colliding.

Chen Zhanbiao took two steps back, his face filled with excitement. He looked at the guard and laughed loudly: "Good! You have strength!"

The guard took more than ten steps back. The ground had deep footprints, and cracks surrounded them. His gaze was filled with disbelief.

"Is this a human's body? How could it be stronger than me!" The guard was shocked, his entire arm losing sensation.

"You dare to cause trouble in the Beast Domain!" The other guard, identical in appearance, also looked shocked and shouted.

"Who is this friend of Luo Tian's? His body is how strong! It can withstand a Super-Immortal's body!" Du Hongtao and Lu Han looked at Chen Zhanbiao, who had tensed his muscles.

"Don't worry about your companion. Worry about yourself!" Wan Lingkong smiled and lightly flicked his hand, sending dozens of array flags into the air. They transformed into golden lights surrounding another guard.

"Array!" The guard's face showed a hint of surprise. He looked at Wan Lingkong with disdain.

The Beast Domain valued strength, and it had some contempt for arrays. This was due to the strong bodies of beasts and their lack of understanding of arrays.

"Let's have you too!" Wan Lingkong didn't care about the guard's disdain. He moved his hand, and nine sources of power instantly shot out from his hands. A series of source symbols rushed into the array flags.

"Roar..." A golden dragon instantly roared, and in a flash, it flew out of the array flags. It formed a golden net that instantly wrapped around the guard.

"Haha, what strength can Nine-Origin Supreme Sage arrays have!" The guard spoke coldly and showed no concern for the array covering him. He forcefully struggled to break free.

"Ah?" But in the next moment, the guard's face showed a hint of surprise. His eyes were filled with shock; no matter how he moved, the golden net that seemed ready to break at any moment could not be broken.

"Damn it! What array is this!" The guard's inner shock was immense. He felt the array embedded in his body, even able to destroy his soul. His heart was terrified.

"Haha! It's exhilarating!" Chen Zhanbiao's deep voice echoed in the sky, like a series of thunderclaps. His voice was filled with excitement.

Their eyes were drawn to the two men in the sky, their expressions filled with admiration. It was truly震撼ing—body against body combat was the most thrilling.

Even Luo Tian, Du Hongtao, and Lu Han, three Sage-beginner level warriors, showed expressions of admiration. The collision between the two bodies was violent to the extreme.

Though Chen Zhanbiao's cultivation level was low, his body had managed to suppress the Super-Immortal beast. Each collision caused blood to spurt from the guard's Rhino Clan mouth, falling to the ground.

Chen Zhanbiao was exhausted and pale. His lips continuously dripped blood, but his eyes were increasingly excited, like a wild bull charging forward.

"Mu..." Finally, the guard couldn't withstand it and revealed his true form. His massive rhino body instantly filled the sky, rushing toward Chen Zhanbiao.

The powerful pressure and beastly aura did not make Chen Zhanbiao fear at all. Instead, it made him even more excited: "Ah? There's food! Haha, I never thought you were a beast. Seems I can have a hearty meal tonight! Brother, can we eat beef in the evening?"

Chen Zhanbiao's mouth watered as he looked at the rhino beside him, addressing Xu Liyi with a begging look.

"Good, good!" Xu Liyi knew Chen Zhanbiao's appetite well. His face showed a bitter expression as he nodded to Chen Zhanbiao in helplessness.

"Brother, I really miss you. These years I haven't saved a single coin!" Xu Liyi looked at Luo Tian with a pitiful expression, thinking Luo Tian must have saved a lot of money over the years.

"Get lost..." Luo Tian kicked Xu Liyi away with one foot, smiling. He had experienced much with Chen Zhanbiao and knew his strong body was built through eating.

"Seems everyone has grown!" Luo Tian's face showed a sense of admiration, gazing at Gu Lei and the others who stood calmly. He felt happy for them and for the future of the Four Sacred Stars.

"About enough. Since we're just arriving in the Beast Domain, it's better to stay low-key!" Luo Tian looked at Chen Zhanbiao colliding with the rhino guard and spoke softly: "Chen Zhanbiao, stop!"

The text continues with further details about the journey into the Beast Domain and interactions with other characters, but due to length constraints, this concludes the translation.
