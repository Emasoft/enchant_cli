“Don’t know! Have the disciples within the sect strengthen their vigilance. Though the Nine Realms seem tranquil now, the Four Sacred Star Realms have become a cauldron of turmoil. Our strength has increased considerably, but compared to the true holy sects of the sacred realms, we still fall short. Be prepared at all times to contact both the Four Sacred Star Realms and the Demon Realm!” Lu Tianyu spoke softly, drawing out his identification token to issue commands.

“Indeed,” Luo Tian nodded silently in approval. He no longer paid attention to the two men, flying alongside Sun Kainian toward the teleportation array.

With the Nine Realms now unified, each realm possessed a teleportation array, making travel between star realms convenient. Many frequently journeyed to other star realms to glimpse their appearances.

The three formed a line and quickly stood upon the teleportation array. The transmission force enveloped them, instantly transporting them into the Divine and Demon Realm.

“Divine and Demon Realm!” Upon landing, Luo Tian and Sun Kainian immediately transformed into three long streaks of light, rushing toward the Yin Yang Sect.

“Faster! But not as fast as my Uncle Long or Uncle Jiang!” Luo Li felt their unparalleled speed, his mind trembling. He gazed at Luo Tian and Sun Kainian, sensing their immense power before letting out a cold snort.

After the chaos of the Mortal Realm, the entire Nine Realms experienced a period of decline. However, with time passing, the Divine and Demon Realm gradually recovered.

Many sects rose rapidly after the turbulence. The Yin Yang Sect was one such example. Once, it had been immensely powerful. After the Mortal Realm’s calamity, it had retreated under the protection of the Divine Race, preserving its strength intact. Over these years, for unknown reasons, the Divine Race seemed to deliberately support the Yin Yang Sect, enabling it to ascend further. It now subtly threatened to become the third major power within the Divine and Demon Realm.

At this moment, the Yin Yang Sect was bustling. On its vast continent, a mountain of stark black and white occupied one-third of the landmass.

“Go intercept Dong Yichen!”
“Also, go kill Zi Mo. As for Zheng Xin, we’ll handle them ourselves. If they dare to leave the Tianyuan Continent, strike!” In the Yin Yang Sect’s grand hall, former Yin Yang Holy Prince Lin Yangquan and Lin Yinming issued commands with icy expressions.

“Where are the two who attempted to kill Luo Li? They haven’t returned yet,” the pair inquired next.

“Report, my lords. Their soul-lanterns have gone out—meaning they failed,” a subordinate replied swiftly.

For many years, Lin Yangquan and Lin Yinming had become the sect’s leaders. Yet for unknown reasons, they had begun targeting the Four Sacred Star Realms shortly after assuming leadership, constantly assassinating its prodigies.

Though their operations had been discreet over the years, they remained in constant fear. If discovered to be responsible, they would openly defy the entire Nine Realms.

Luo Tian was a celebrated hero across the Nine Realms. Even the former Divine King Sun Shengtian of the Divine Race had sworn that as long as he remained in power, he would not attack the Four Sacred Star Realms.

Yet now, the Yin Yang Sect dared to act against Luo Tian’s descendants. How could one not fear them? Over the years, the Yin Yang Sect had attempted to kill Zi Mo and Dong Yichen’s siblings, as well as Luo Li multiple times. Yet each time, they had failed.

“Fools! Two early-stage Nascent Souls couldn’t even eliminate a mere Transcendent. But the Four Sacred Star Realms’ people know who attacked them yet dare not retaliate. Without Luo Tian, the Four Sacred Star Realms’ people are truly cowards. If that person were still alive, they would have marched with a spear to attack those holy sects!” Lin Yangquan’s face bore an expression of sorrowful sigh.

Though the Yin Yang Sect was formidable, without external guidance, they wouldn’t dare act so boldly. After all, the Four Sacred Star Realms’ strength was no longer something the Yin Yang Sect could match.

Yet the Four Sacred Star Realms perhaps did not wish to reignite war, so they had remained patient. However, these people had grown even more brazen.

“Enough. Continue observing. If there are any updates, inform us,” Lin Yinming shook his head and waved to the several individuals in the hall. These were those involved in assassinating the Four Sacred Star Realms’ people—even among the Yin Yang Sect, few knew of their involvement.

“Rumbling…” Just as they were about to depart, Luo Tian and Sun Kainian appeared above the Yin Yang Sect with Luo Li. Gazing at the massive mountain defense array, Luo Tian’s eyes brimmed with killing intent. Slowly lifting his foot, he stomped down upon the Yin Yang Sect’s mountain defense array.

“Crack…” One step landed, and the Yin Yang Sect’s mountain defense array shattered beneath Luo Tian’s foot. The entire Yin Yang Mountain trembled violently.

“What is this!” Lin Yinming and Lin Yangquan’s faces changed. Their bodies vanished, instantly appearing outside the Yin Yang Mountain to see Luo Tian, Sun Kainian, and Luo Li.

With a flicker of movement, numerous Yin Yang Sect disciples appeared in the sky, their faces filled with fury. Their gazes contained killing intent as they stared at Luo Tian and his companions.

“Who are you? How dare you attack our Yin Yang Sect’s mountain defense array!” Lin Yinming and Lin Yangquan shouted, their voices carrying authority.

“You’ve grown stronger. You’ve reached the early stage of the Epoch,” Luo Tian’s eyes showed coldness as he surveyed them.

“These two are formidable. Combined, they can rival the middle stage of the Epoch. However, compared to Sun Miechen and your Uncle Long, they still fall short,” Sun Kainian spoke, clearly familiar with them.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian nodded. He had never trusted the two initially, though their strength was considerable, they still fell short of theirs.

“The Yin Yang Sect truly has great power,” Luo Tian’s face bore mockery as he gazed at Lin Yinming and Lin Yangquan.

“Who are you exactly?” Lin Yinming and Lin Yangquan felt the danger Luo Tian brought, asking again.

“I am merely a minor figure. I’ve come to demand an explanation for your actions,” Luo Tian stood there, speaking softly.

“Do you know what offense we have committed against you? This hatred is immense. The Yin Yang Sect isn’t a place where you can come and go as you please. If there’s no explanation, even if you are at the early stage of the Epoch, you will spill blood here!” Lin Yangquan spoke coldly, his voice carrying dominance.

“Who is Luo Tian? You should know. Why have you repeatedly attacked Luo Tian’s descendants?” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness, his aura rising gradually.

“What? When did the Yin Yang Sect attack Luo Tian’s descendants?”
“Previously, I heard that someone had attacked Luo Tian’s disciples and son. Could it be us?” Some of the Yin Yang Sect’s disciples and elders looked puzzled, gazing at Lin Yinming and Lin Yangquan as they whispered among themselves.

“Nonsense. Don’t fabricate an excuse to blame us. I think you’re merely provoking the Yin Yang Sect. Yin Yang Sect disciples, follow me in striking down this enemy who dares to provoke us!” Lin Yangquan and Lin Yinming, upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, spoke with killing intent. They rushed toward the Yin Yang Sect disciples.

“Furious and embarrassed? I’ve come to destroy your Yin Yang Sect this year. What can you do about it?” Luo Tian laughed loudly, his voice cold. He took another step forward, his golden foot overshadowing the sky as it descended upon Lin Yangquan and Lin Yinming.

“Extremely powerful!” Luo Li, watching Luo Tian’s overwhelming presence, felt a brief daze.

“Boy, watch closely. He truly is your father!” Sun Kainian shielded Luo Li, his eyes filled with excitement as he gazed at the back of the Yin Yang Sect’s mountain. That was where the sect’s past masters lay in eternal slumber.

Chapter 1378: One Step Shatters the Sect

“Ferocious God Stomps Through Stars!” The second step descended, thundering. Luo Tian’s golden foot pressed down upon Lin Yinming and Lin Yangquan.

Lin Yinming and Lin Yangquan’s minds trembled. They gazed at the foot radiating overwhelming power, a technique they had never before witnessed. The wild aura flowed upon the foot, and at that moment, Luo Tian seemed like a giant.

“Yin Yang Great Seal!” Lin Yinming and Lin Yangquan’s hands formed seals, merging into one. A black-and-white seal emerged in their grasp, emitting a continuous hum as it flew toward Luo Tian’s golden foot.

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s current strength was at the middle stage of the Epoch, easily capable of withstanding it. The early-stage Epoch was utterly crushed by him.

The golden foot collided with the black-and-white seal. After the collision, the seal shattered violently, transforming into a surge of Epoch energy that swept across the black-and-white mountain.

“Puk!” Numerous Yin Yang Sect disciples were震 to吐血, their eyes filled with fear.

“Withstand it!” Lin Yinming and Lin Yangquan roared, their bodies radiating formidable waves. They endured the foot’s power, which had been weakened by the Yin Yang Seal.

Their bodies were thrown back, their eyes filled with disbelief as they gazed at Luo Tian standing tall in the sky. They pondered when in the Nine Realms such a figure had emerged.

“Who are you?” Both spoke simultaneously, their eyes fixated on Luo Tian as if trying to discern his true identity. However, they soon became disappointed, for no matter how hard they looked, Luo Tian appeared as a common man.

“I am merely an unknown minor. There’s no need to know who I am. You only need to understand that today, the Yin Yang Sect will cease to exist!” Luo Tian chuckled softly. He surveyed them before extending his hand, as if capable of plucking stars from the heavens, and struck toward them.

“Die!” Lin Yinming and Lin Yangquan’s faces bore coldness. They exchanged glances before their hands flew forward, colliding with each other.

“Yin Yang Life Curse!” Lin Yinming and Lin Yangquan rapidly merged into one, a secret technique exclusive to the Yin Yang Sect. Only they could perform it.

One black and one white, merging into a single figure. Their aura surged dramatically, climbing to the middle stage of the Epoch with overwhelming might.

“Again this trick? Besides their cultivation, they’ve made no progress!” Luo Tian scoffed internally. He took another step toward them, the third stomp of his Ferocious Seven Steps.

“Kid, now I want to see what you can use to resist us!” A low voice emerged from the merged pair. Black and white energy surrounded them as they formed seals, sending another black-and-white seal toward Luo Tian.

The middle stage of the Epoch was rare across the Nine Realms. Their current strength had vastly improved, and it was due to the Yin Yang Life Curse that the Yin Yang Sect had become formidable within the Divine and Demon Realm.

“Back then, I could subdue you both. Now I still can!” Luo Tian scoffed internally as he watched the third stomp be dismantled by them. He took a fourth step.

The thunderous sound echoed, three reincarnated immortal bodies in Luo Tian’s dantian emitted a continuous hum. His golden foot descended again, like a god descending from the heavens, crushing down upon the merged pair.

A powerful pressure instantly struck their bodies. Their expressions changed in shock. This stomp had fully utilized two great techniques, and even the middle stage of the Epoch would be annihilated under it.

“Yin Yang Convergence Seal!” Their eyes flashed with madness. The Taijitu diagram surged under their control, emitting a thunderous sound as it flew toward Luo Tian’s fourth stomp.

Turbulent waves, thunderous vibrations. The black-and-white holy mountain trembled under their collision, deep cracks spreading across its massive body.

“Puk!” After one stomp, two figures were thrown apart in the turbulent waves, their faces filled with disbelief.

“They’ve separated!” The Yin Yang Sect disciples’ faces bore astonishment. They knew the power of the Yin Yang Life Curse, and how few had ever mastered it across the years. Only six individuals in the entire sect had achieved success.

Lin Yinming and Lin Yangquan, through this secret technique, had subdued countless enemies. It was due to this technique that they felt confident in assassinating Zheng Xin and others.

Yet now, their invincible secret technique had crumbled before this man. One stomp had shattered it.

“Over the years, only one person has ever broken through both masters’ Yin Yang Life Curse. That was Luo Tian, the绝代天骄 who had once subdued all peers in the Nine Realms and eventually perished,”

“Unexpectedly, there is now a second!” The two old masters of the Yin Yang Sect sighed softly. Their eyes gazed at Luo Tian, who stood in the sky as a man. Their gazes were deep and profound. At this moment, they had both reached the early stage of the Epoch.

“Yin Yang Sect disciples, activate the Reverse Chaos Array!” The two masters flew into the air and addressed their three million disciples and elders.

“Yes!” Upon hearing the old masters’ shouts, people finally regained their senses after Lin Yinming and Lin Yangquan’s defeat. They shouted in unison.

Though the Yin Yang Sect disciples were shocked by Luo Tian’s strength, they knew it was not a time for shock. This man clearly bore great hostility toward the Yin Yang Sect.

“Kill!” Three million people swiftly gathered, black and white energy rapidly circulating. A continuous hum resonated from the many Yin Yang Sect disciples.

In an instant, a Yin Yang Array appeared before Luo Tian’s eyes. The overwhelming pressure made him frown slightly.

“Sun, help me out!” Luo Tian turned around. Facing such an array, if he miscalculated, he might suffer serious injuries. However, with Sun Kainian’s help, together they could easily destroy the array without harm.

“Damn!” However, soon after, Luo Tian discovered that his back was empty. Where was Sun Kainian’s figure?

“You mother!” His vast spiritual awareness swept out, instantly discovering Sun Kainian. He was with Luo Li in the back of Yin Yang Mountain, stealthily carving on a tomb’s entrance.

“Thieves! Are you entering the Yin Yang Sect’s great tomb?” Luo Li couldn’t speak, but he could transmit thoughts to Sun Kainian.

“Of course. Boy, today I’ll let you see what it means to have no tomb that my Sun大爷 can’t enter. I can sense there’s something extraordinary within this great tomb. Do you want to come in with me? This should be a tomb of the Epoch peak!” Sun Kainian rubbed his hands, excitement in his eyes.

Upon hearing Sun Kainian’s words, Luo Li’s eyes also sparkled. He nodded slightly, clearly curious.

“However, don’t you want to stop him? I feel that some of the Yin Yang Sect people seem ready to fight!” Luo Li then felt the terrifying waves. He gazed at Luo Tian, who appeared isolated and vulnerable. After all, he had come to help him avenge.

“Ha ha! Good boy, don’t worry. No one will die. He is who he is—your father!”
“Come on, let me see if you have talent. If you do, I’ll take you as my disciple!” Sun Kainian laughed loudly, confidence in his eyes. He grabbed Luo Li and rushed into the opened tomb entrance.

“Your mother!” Luo Tian couldn’t help but curse. A bad premonition suddenly arose in his heart, feeling that entrusting Luo Li to Sun Kainian was a mistake. He felt regret and fear, fearing that Luo Li would be corrupted by Sun Kainian.

“Rumbling…” As Luo Tian pondered, the black-and-white array also activated. Thunderous sounds echoed as it seemed to subdue heaven and earth, pressing toward Luo Tian.

“I’ll do it myself!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth. He took the fifth step of Ferocious Seven Steps, thunderous sound echoing through the sky. Facing the Yin Yang Sect’s entire array, Luo Tian clearly fought with all his might.

“Boom…” One reincarnated immortal body in Luo Tian’s dantian shattered violently, transforming into pure Epoch energy. The梵天攻杀 technique instantly transferred to Luo Tian’s right leg.

“Ferocious God Five Steps Shake the World!” A low roar echoed from Luo Tian’s mouth. This was his first time fully unleashing his strength. A terrifying aura rose from Luo Tian’s feet.

A massive phantom emerged behind Luo Tian, wild energy flowing through it. It was like a king ruling over the heavens, lonely and powerful. If any蛮族 people were here, they would be astonished beyond measure, for the phantom’s appearance was exactly that of the蛮族 god worshipped in the蛮神殿, the king of the蛮族.

The golden foot slowly stepped forward, colliding with the black-and-white array. A powerful thunderous sound echoed.

“Boom… Boom…” Explosions rose amidst the swirling waves, forming blood mist that rained down upon the black-and-white holy mountain. The mountain was stained red.

Numerous Yin Yang Sect disciples perished in this collision. Luo Tian’s eyes turned blood-red, his body filled with blood. His body was covered in cracks, and blood continuously flowed from them.

“I said you must die! You must die!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness. The reincarnated immortal bodies continuously worked to heal his injuries while Luo Tian’s figure moved like a ghost into the disarrayed Yin Yang Sect disciples.

Lin Yinming’s face bore disbelief. He couldn’t fathom that there was such a strong person in the Nine Realms who could break through the Yin Yang Sect’s array. One strike had wounded them all, and in that one strike, countless Yin Yang Sect disciples and elders had perished.

As Lin Yinming was stunned in thought, a figure with overwhelming blood energy appeared behind him. Two powerful hands grabbed Lin Yinming and lifted him.

Chapter 1379: Destroying the Sect

“Boom…” Luo Tian’s arms swelled with power. He forcefully tore Lin Yinming apart beneath the sky.

“Xiaoqi!” The seven-color flame mark on Luo Tian’s forehead pulsed, radiating waves. The seven-color flames erupted from Luo Tian’s hands.

“Roar…” The seven-color fire dragon, dazzling and brilliant, instantly devoured Lin Yinming’s scattered flesh. It turned into a cloud of smoke that drifted into the sky.

One of the Yin Yang Sect’s new masters, Lin Yinming, was slain!

Numerous severely wounded Yin Yang Sect disciples bore expressions of shock. They gazed at the fierce fire dragon in the sky, their eyes filled with disbelief.

“Ah…” Lin Yangquan roared, rushing toward Luo Tian in a frenzy. Since birth, they had been like one person. Now that Lin Yinming was dead, how could he bear it?

“Now it’s your turn!” Luo Tian gazed at Lin Yangquan rushing toward him. He let out a cold snort and ascended into the sky, throwing a punch that pierced through space. It struck Lin Yangquan’s body instantly.

“Boom…” Blood mist rose again. Lin Yangquan soon followed Lin Yinming’s fate, being devoured by the seven-color flames and perishing completely.

“You all must die!” Luo Tian’s eyes bore coldness as he gazed at the remaining Yin Yang Sect disciples.

Regardless of whether they knew Lin Yinming and Lin Yangquan had attacked his descendants, since they did it, they must bear the consequences.

Thinking of his descendants being repeatedly assassinated, Luo Tian’s heart bled. His entire body was somewhat mad.

If he hadn’t returned in time, Luo Li’s life might have been lost. Moreover, Luo Tian wasn’t sure if others had suffered injuries. If so, he would never forgive himself.

“Everyone must die! Who dares to harm my family, I will annihilate their entire clan!” Dragons have a reverse scale; Luo Tian’s reverse scale was his family. Who dared to harm them, Luo Tian would never let them go—no one left alive.

With a low roar, Luo Tian’s hands rapidly changed. A series of seven-color fire dragons erupted from his hands. At the same time, Xiaoqi’s figure appeared beside Luo Tian. Feeling Luo Tian’s anger and killing intent, it continuously emitted seven-color flames, instantly engulfing a large number of Yin Yang Sect disciples.

“Ah…” screams rose from the seven-color flames. Any disciple who touched those flames was instantly killed, with only a few able to withstand it.

“Fen Tian Li Fire Array!” Luo Tian grabbed his hands, thundering. The terrifying temperature instantly burned through space, submerging the entire black-and-white holy mountain. The whole world was filled with seven-color flames.

“Ten thousand… a million…” People died every moment. Luo Tian’s eyes remained cold, gazing at the countless Yin Yang Sect disciples dying in his hands. He softly sighed: “If you must blame, it’s because you were born into the Yin Yang Sect. If you must blame, it’s because your masters shouldn’t have attacked my descendants!”

“Ah…” a wave of gray mist rose from the flames, fleeing toward all directions. These were the Yin Yang Sect’s strong individuals whose bodies had been burned but who relied on their soul to escape.

“I am a Soul-Subduing Master!” Luo Tian’s eyes bore mockery. His hands continuously moved, and the轮回天功 technique was activated. Strange waves formed in his hands.

“Return!” Luo Tian shouted, and those who tried to flee immediately stopped. Their eyes showed fear, including the two old masters of the Yin Yang Sect, who also trembled in their hearts.

Invisible waves pulled upon numerous souls. They could not resist, as it was an instinctive submission.

“Everything is born and transformed!” Luo Tian activated again. The power of grass and trees surged from his hands, rushing into the raging fire.

The fire roared. Adding the power of grass and trees, the seven-color flames became even more terrifying, as if bringing the entire fire domain’s flame. The terrifying temperature made people on the Yin Yang Continent feel fear.

“Where is the Yin Yang Sect!” People on the Yin Yang Continent bore expressions of fear, gazing at the seven-color flames that had submerged the entire massive Yin Yang Holy Mountain. Their hearts were filled with terror.

“What’s happening? Has someone attacked the Yin Yang Sect and burned it all away!” People felt fear.

“Who has such power? Could it be a holy sect?” Fearful, people also guessed which holy sect had attacked the Yin Yang Sect with such a bold move.

The flames soared, turning the entire Yin Yang Mountain into scorched earth. The hot air continuously radiated from the massive mountain.

“This is only the first!” Luo Tian’s hands moved, his eyes flashing with coldness. A line of large characters was imprinted on the slowly healing sky, never to fade.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian called out to Sun Kainian and Luo Li, taking a long breath. His face was also pale, clearly the battle had greatly drained him.

“Roar…” Just as Luo Tian called for Sun Kainian and Luo Li to leave, a low roar echoed from the scorched mountain.

“Hm?” Luo Tian’s eyebrows slightly furrowed. His gaze became deep, looking at an exit hole. That was where Sun Kainian and Luo Li had entered.

“Run!” Next moment, a disheveled figure flew out of the hole. His body was surrounded by gray mist, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“What’s happening!” Luo Tian grabbed Sun Kainian and spoke seriously. His eyes showed anxiety because he hadn’t seen Luo Li’s figure.

“There are two souls at the peak of the Epoch!” Sun Kainian spoke anxiously, his body instinctively trembling.

“Where is Luo Li?” Upon hearing Sun Kainian’s words, Luo Tian’s heart trembled and he asked.

“Ah… I forgot…” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s question, Sun Kainian instinctively slapped his head.

“Damn it, I’ll deal with you later!” Luo Tian kicked Sun Kainian away. His body moved swiftly toward the black hole.

Before he could fly in, a low roar echoed from the hole. Two overwhelming presences immediately appeared before Luo Tian’s eyes.

“Who are you? Why have you come here! Disturbing our brothers’ eternal slumber!” Two soul forms radiated immense authority. Their gray eyes gazed at Luo Tian.

“Where is the boy?” Luo Tian’s eyes brimmed with killing intent. He pointed his hand toward the two souls, sending an invisible wave toward them.

“Die! How dare you attack us!” The two soul forms instantly turned fierce, their gray souls radiating powerful killing intent.

“Soul Subdue!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with a wave of gray mist. An invisible pressure radiated from his body. This pressure had no harm to humans, even ordinary people without cultivation would not be harmed.

However, this pressure was a powerful deterrent to souls. It was the unique restraint of the Soul-Subduing Master against souls.

“Roar…” As soon as Luo Tian’s words were spoken, the two powerful soul forms immediately froze. Their gray eyes showed intense fear. They stood still as if bound by something.

“Who are you?” The two soul forms spoke softly. They felt Luo Tian’s indomitable power, which made them despair.

“Where is the boy?” Luo Tian spoke softly. Before the two great souls, he seemed like an emperor.

“He ran away, fleeing into the void!” The two soul forms, powerful as they were, would have no fear against a middle-stage Epoch or even later. However, before Luo Tian, they could only choose to submit and spoke to him.

“Damn kid!” Luo Tian sighed longingly. He extended his hand, the sky instantly formed a rift. His vast spiritual awareness rushed into the void and quickly found Luo Li’s escape route.

“Return to me!” Luo Tian roared, his white Epoch hand rushing into the void. He grabbed the fleeing Luo Li and brought him before himself.

“Let me go!” Luo Li shouted, his voice still unchanged. The young woman’s voice echoed, making Luo Tian somewhat uncomfortable.

“Little bastard! You wanted to run? Come back with me. It’s too dangerous for you to go alone. Who let you run out like that!” Luo Tian slapped Luo Li’s head, speaking angrily.

Luo Li’s eyes flashed with anger but he was powerless. Before the early stage of the Epoch, he truly was a child.

“Boy, give me the treasures in this tomb!” Sun Kainian, seeing no danger, shamelessly approached. He rubbed his hands.

“You damned bastard! Get lost!” Luo Tian kicked Sun Kainian away again. When danger arose, he had run off first, leaving his son behind. Only Sun Kainian could do such a thing.

“Hmph…” Luo Li also gazed at Sun Kainian, his face filled with resentment. He hadn’t expected this bastard to abandon him at the crucial moment, fleeing faster than anyone else. If it weren’t for his secret escape and breaking Luo Tian’s seal, slipping into the void, those two souls would have killed him immediately.

“Alright, alright. Don’t be angry. I’ll just give it up!” Sun Kainian licked his lips and returned, eyes flashing with light.

“Boy, want to be my disciple? Your body type is a waste not doing this!” Sun Kainian looked at Luo Li, as if gazing at an unpolished jade.

“Sun… Kainian…” Luo Tian gritted his teeth, his eyes flashing with killing intent.

“Go…” However, soon after, Luo Tian deeply gazed at the domain beyond. He collected the two powerful souls he had subdued and pulled Luo Li, tearing through space to enter it.

“Hum…” As soon as the three of them left, a golden-clad youth flew in from beyond the domain. His eyes gazed at the large characters Luo Tian had written in the sky, his eyes flashing with cold light.

Chapter 1380: Who Is It?

“This is only the first!” The youth’s body shimmered with golden light. His eyes gazed at the large characters Luo Tian had written in the sky. He waved his hand, and a series of images appeared in his mind.

This youth was the current Divine King of the Divine Race, Sun Miechen.

The images showed Luo Tian’s battle against the entire Yin Yang Sect. When the youth saw Luo Tian’s final step, shattering the Yin Yang Sect’s array, Sun Miechen’s eyebrows slightly furrowed. His eyes flashed with golden light.

“Interesting. When did the Nine Realms produce such a person?” Sun Miechen’s face bore an interested expression. His eyes became deep.

“I wonder who the next one will be,” Sun Miechen’s aura surged. His body flickered and vanished from the Yin Yang Continent.

……

“Hum…” Luo Tian and Sun Kainian appeared in the Divine and Demon Realm. Their faces showed no expression. The three still hadn’t recovered their identities, flying toward the teleportation array of the Divine and Demon Realm with Luo Li.

“Luo Tian, you’re really fierce. You’ve destroyed the Yin Yang Sect outright. This will cause a big incident!” Sun Kainian looked at Luo Tian, who remained calm. His eyes flashed with excitement.

“If they attacked my descendants, how could I not retaliate? If they want to play dirty, I’ll match them,” Luo Tian gently touched his face’s illusion mask and spoke coldly. A plan had already formed in his mind.

“What are your plans?” Sun Kainian’s eyes flashed with excitement. He still remembered the ambush on him and Sima Tuo, who had done nothing but been forced into the void. To this day, Sima Tuo was still unknown whether he was alive or dead.

“If they assassinate my descendants, I’ll assassinate theirs. I want to see who can escape my pursuit!” Luo Tian clenched his fists. He didn’t go to the Demon Realm to find Nan Gong Yuqing at that moment. He really wanted to return to the Four Sacred Star Realms and reunite with his family.

“Stop calling yourself by my name, it’s annoying!” Luo Li still looked like a beautiful young woman. He spoke coldly to Luo Tian.

“Don’t talk! If you speak, it’s more annoying!”

“But, boy, what about considering becoming my disciple?” Sun Kainian’s face bore temptation as he spoke to Luo Li.

“Get lost…” This time, before Luo Li could speak, Luo Tian kicked Sun Kainian onto the teleportation array.

“Go! Once we reach the Four Sacred Star Realms, I’ll prove I’m your father!” Luo Tian sneered. He grabbed Luo Li and threw him onto the teleportation array, then stepped on it himself.

The hum echoed. The three figures vanished from the teleportation array.

Just as they left, a command was issued from the Divine King’s residence in the Divine Race of the Divine and Demon Realm.

“Search for these three people with all our strength. No matter which realm, we must find them!” Sun Miechen’s voice echoed across the divine mountain. At the same time, the appearances of Luo Tian, Sun Kainian, and the girl-like Luo Li were shown on the divine mountain.

“Who are these three? The Divine King hasn’t issued such a serious command in a long time. And it’s about finding people!” Murmurs arose across the divine mountain.

The next day after Luo Tian and his companions left the Divine and Demon Realm, a sensational news spread throughout the entire realm.

The once-flourishing Yin Yang Sect was destroyed in one day. As for who had done it, no trace was found—meaning the perpetrator remained unknown.

However, people knew that only a few in the Nine Realms could destroy such a powerful sect. Immediately, people speculated about those holy sects.

This news soon spread across the Nine Realms, causing unease among forces comparable to the Yin Yang Sect. The Yin Yang Sect’s destruction left a message, indicating it was only the first, and more might follow.

“Who is it?” People speculated. The Yin Yang Sect had many enemies in recent years, so no clear clues emerged.

However, the three people being searched for by the Divine Race became the focus of attention. Everyone knew that the Yin Yang Sect’s previous strength was closely tied to the Divine Race’s support. Now, its destruction was a direct slap in the face of the Divine Race.

The Divine Race remained a colossal force within the Nine Realms. The Divine King Sun Miechen, with his middle-stage Epoch cultivation, was terrifying. No one knew what kind of combat power he possessed now.

While people discussed the Yin Yang Sect’s destruction, Luo Tian and his companions appeared in the Four Sacred Star Realms they had long awaited.

“I’m back!” Luo Tian’s eyes were filled with excitement. He felt the familiar aura of the Four Sacred Star Realms, gazing toward the Tianyuan Continent and speaking softly.

“Hum…” Upon Luo Tian’s appearance in the Four Sacred Star Realms, the golden ancient palace on the Five Elements Mountain of the Tianyuan Continent emitted a thunderous sound. Four spirit guardians stood within the ancient palace, their faces also showing excitement.

“Luo Tian has returned!” The main spirit guardian Meng Yunxiao spoke in disbelief. He quickly relayed the news to Jiang Nanxuan.

In a bamboo forest, Jiang Nanxuan’s face was calm. He gently played his purple zither, appearing even more transcendent. Nothing could disturb his composure.

However, when Meng Yunxiao relayed the news to Jiang Nanxuan, the music clearly faltered.

“Has he returned?” Jiang Nanxuan smiled faintly. His eyes sparkled, and he slowly stood up, flying out of the Tianyuan Continent.

Because of the ancient palace’s existence, apart from Gu Qianshi and four other women, as well as Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian’s couple, Jiang Nanxuan was the only one who believed Luo Tian had not died.

“Ha ha! That kid has returned!” In another grand hall, Yin Yu spirit guardian also sensed Luo Tian’s return.
