"Xue Sheng Fei!" The human race's people bore expressions of fury, gazing at the crimson figure.

"Charge forward—we shall claim this Era's Mark!" Several royal offspring, their faces etched with murderous intent, disregarded protocol entirely. Their sole purpose was to attain the Dao.

"Without you, we can still charge forward!" A powerful being of the blood clan, having lived a second life, bore an icy expression. His form flickered as he surged toward Luo Tian.

"Repel him!" The people's faces bore wrath; Jiang Nanxuan's injury had ignited their fury.

"Kill..." Yao Chen, Long Jie, Wang Wang and others launched themselves, charging toward the powerful beings who had lived a second life.

Others also blocked the prodigies of the Ancient Kings' race, but this time the human race had fallen behind. Several powerful beings who had lived a second life slaughtered Zheng Xin and others with ease, causing them to cough up blood.

Cries of battle echoed through the sky. Time passed slowly; the human race's people could no longer endure, their faces pale.

"Hah... leave!" Xue Sheng Fei's form flickered. His crimson head transformed into a fleeting shadow, piercing Diao Dezhù's heart. He kicked Diao Dezhù away, appearing beneath the stars of Xing Luo Domain.

"Body Transference!" Xue Sheng Fei's hands moved, crimson seals flashing forth. They surged toward Luo Tian.

"Die!" Diao Dezhù's face paled, blood gushing from his mouth. Froth mixed with the blood, flowing down.

"Luo Tian, I've done my best—hold on!" Diao Dezhù's eyes bore weakness. His voice carried guilt.

"Die!" Xue Sheng Fei's form, through Body Transference, materialized before Luo Tian. His face bore fervor; his crimson head lunged toward Luo Tian's heart.

"Ah..." The human race's people roared, attempting to break free from their opponents. However, several powerful beings who had lived a second life crushed them completely, leaving no chance for the group.

"Finished..." Time seemed to freeze. All faces bore despair as the crimson head transformed into a fleeting shadow, appearing over Luo Tian's heart.

"Leave..." But just as the crimson head was about to touch Luo Tian's heart, Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes. A cold voice emerged from Luo Tian.

Chapter 1747: Overwhelming All Enemies

Xue Sheng Fei's face still bore excitement, as if he saw himself obtaining the Dao Mark. However, that cold aura carried immense pressure, instantly awakening Xue Sheng Fei. The crimson head halted at Luo Tian's chest. Xue Sheng Fei saw a pair of icy eyes.

"Luo... Luo Tian..." Xue Sheng Fei's voice trembled. He felt as if wrapped in ten thousand years of ice, his body trembling involuntarily.

"Leave..." A dignified voice emerged from Luo Tian. The crimson head, resting on his chest, shattered with a thunderous explosion, dispersing into blood mist before Luo Tian.

Xue Sheng Fei's body was suddenly hurled backward, as if struck by an invisible hand. Blood spewed from his mouth; his eyes bore disbelief.

"Luo Tian..." Everyone halted their actions, watching Luo Tian rise slowly. They forgot the battle.

"Has he attained the Dao?" The human race's people cried out, their eyes filled with excitement. Their faces bore a ragged expression; the powerful beings who had lived a second life had pressed them so hard, they were constantly on the defensive. Only Wang Wang and Long Jie, among the prodigies, could match them.

"Something's wrong. His aura isn't right—it's not yet complete!" However, the royal clan's people soon spoke. Although Luo Tian's aura was supreme, it wasn't as strong as the kings' in their memories.

"Right. How easy is it to refine a Dao Mark!" The royal clan's people's eyes gleamed again. They gazed at Luo Tian.

"Hah, I'm right here. If you have the courage, come and take it!" Luo Tian stood beneath the stars, gazing at his life-and-death brothers who had suffered heavy injuries. His eyes bore wild fury.

The royal clan's people were correct—Luo Tian had not yet fully refined the Dao Mark. However, he had refined it nearly completely. While refining, he also kept part of his mind focused on the outside.

Seeing his loved ones and friends risking their lives to block the royal clan's people, Luo Tian could no longer sit still.

"I'll take it. Everyone rest!" Luo Tian addressed the human race's people, his voice icy. Then, his golden body vanished from their sight.

"Buzz..." A ripple spread. In the next moment, Luo Tian appeared before Xue Sheng Fei, who was flying backward. Golden seals spread across his arms, striking toward Xue Sheng Fei.

A simple punch—yet it made Xue Sheng Fei's face pale. On Luo Tian's golden fist, Xue Sheng Fei felt a strong sense of crisis—death itself.

"Ah..." Xue Sheng Fei roared, attempting to unleash his speed to evade Luo Tian's strike. However, at the moment he moved, a powerful force struck his body, halting him.

"Boom..." Blood mist surged. Xue Sheng Fei's body was reduced to a blood mist by Luo Tian's simple punch, floating in the starry sky.

"One punch—just one punch. Xue Sheng Fei was shattered!" Everyone's hearts trembled, watching Luo Tian standing there.

"Out of respect for your father's past kindness in the Sea's Corner, I'll let you go this time!" Luo Tian sneered, grabbing Xue Sheng Fei's soul with his hand.

Luo Tian waved his hand, sending Xue Sheng Fei to the blood clan's people. Then he took a step forward, appearing before the human race's people. His hands emitted waves of divine laws, enveloping the human race.

A stream of immortal energy burst from Luo Tian's hands, protecting them. At the same time, their injuries healed at an astonishing speed.

"Reviving the dead, mending bones!" The people were shocked. They hadn't expected Luo Tian's power to be so strong. They knew the severity of their injuries; with their current strength, they would have healed long ago.

"Attack!" However, the royal clan's people were still reluctant. Though Luo Tian's display had frightened them, they still had powerful beings who had lived a second life. As long as Luo Tian hadn't attained the Dao, they still had a chance.

"Boom... Boom..." Thunderous sounds echoed. A golden three-legged crow transformed into its true form, bathed in golden flames, radiating intense heat. It surged toward Luo Tian.

Flames roared skyward. In the next moment, golden flames swept over Luo Tian's front, surrounding him.

Luo Tian bore a smile. He gazed at the flames capable of burning through everything, then inhaled, creating a golden vortex in his mouth. It seemed to devour the heavens and earth. The golden flames were directly sucked into his mouth.

"Playing with fire against Luo Tian—this being who had lived a second life is truly... foolish..." Meng Xue held her giant sword, eyes filled with contempt. She spoke softly.

Not only was Luo Tian's strength vastly increased, but even the original Luo Tian could not have done anything against these flames.

The golden flames were completely devoured by Luo Tian, causing no disturbance. Then, Luo Tian exhaled, and seven-colored flames spread across the sky, instantly annihilating vast stretches of space. They flew toward the massive three-legged crow.

"Flame of Annihilation!" Luo Tian's hands formed seals. Waves of immortal energy burst from his hands, filling the seven-colored flames.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." In the next moment, the seven-colored flames surged skyward, instantly enveloping the three-legged crow.

"Ah..." A piercing caw echoed within the fiery atmosphere. The scent of charred flesh spread through space. In an instant, the three-legged crow's massive body seemed to boil.

"Still you!" Luo Tian didn't concern himself with the three-legged crow's refinement. He turned his gaze toward the remaining royal clan beings who had lived a second life and the royal offspring.

"Kill..." Luo Tian moved. No one saw how he moved. When people regained their senses, Luo Tian had already appeared before the being of the Hun Tian clan. He struck with a single palm.

"Boom..." Another simple palm strike landed on the elder of the Hun Tian clan. A crackling sound echoed through space.

Under the people's terrified gaze, that being who had lived a second life was reduced to blood mist. It almost died from Luo Tian's single palm strike.

"Too strong! That was a being who had lived a second life!" Diao Dezhù and others stood beneath the immortal energy, their eyes filled with exhilaration as they gazed at Luo Tian standing proudly.

"Buzz..." A ripple rose beneath Luo Tian's feet. At this moment, Luo Tian was invincible. With a single step forward, he appeared before the elder of the blood clan.

A powerful pressure made the blood clan's elder tremble instantly. He gazed at Luo Tian, as if looking upon a god. He felt no desire to resist and turned to flee.

"Return!" Luo Tian extended his hand, a stream of gray soul threads flying from it. They wrapped around the blood clan's elder, forcibly pulling his soul out and placing it before Luo Tian.

"Defeated! We blood clan submit!" Tu Feiyang's mind trembled. He gazed at Luo Tian, whose eyes were icy, and roared.

"Too late!" Luo Tian's eyes were cold. He extended his hand, a stream of gray energy flowing from it. The blood clan's elder was annihilated in Luo Tian's hands.

"How could he be so strong? He hasn't even fully attained the Dao, yet how can he be this powerful!" Everyone trembled. Their eyes gazed at Luo Tian, who was unstoppable.

"It must be because of his reincarnation body. After all, Luo Tian's physique is very special!" Sun Mengru and others bore a slight smile. It seemed that Luo Tian's attainment of the Dao had become inevitable, no one could stop it.

Saman, Man Zhan, and Fu Cangshan's eyes bore relief. They felt fortunate for having allied with Luo Tian in the past, leaving this backdoor for their clan. They felt it was their wisest choice.

"Ultimately, it was him who took that step!" The human race's people gazed at Luo Tian. Zhuge Qingtian, Wang Wang, Jun Wulei and others bore a bitter expression. Originally, they had planned to compete with Luo Tian after resolving the royal clan's matter. But now it was impossible.

"Use the kings' weapons to kill him!" The remaining royal clan people roared. They then summoned their clan's kings' weapons. Each weapon radiated a brilliant light, striking toward Luo Tian.

This was the royal clan's last attack. At this moment, no one could match Luo Tian. Unless the evil spirit who had emerged from the burial coffin acted, but that evil spirit was currently restrained by Zhang Daotian and others.

"Boom... Boom..." Thunderous sounds echoed. Several kings' weapons appeared above Luo Tian, causing his brow to furrow slightly. However, he soon bore a smile.

"Kings' weapons?" Luo Tian clenched his fists. His eyes brimmed with battle spirit. He decided to confront them with his body alone, without using any weapons.

"Suicide!" Seeing Luo Tian's boldness, the royal clan people felt joy. The kings' weapons they had activated were absolutely comparable to a king's strike.

"Crack..." Thunderous sounds echoed. The royal clan's weapon, the Mortal King's Palace, was shattered by Luo Tian's punch. It collapsed space and was hurled into the void, vanishing somewhere.

"Boom... Boom..." Luo Tian continued to punch. Divine laws flowed. He was like an undefeated war god, and each kings' weapon was shattered by his punches. In a moment, only Luo Tian stood there.

"Despair?" Golden divine blood spilled from Luo Tian's fists. He coldly gazed at the ancient clans.

Chapter 1748: Killing to Attain the Dao

"Subduing kings' weapons with bare hands—this is something only a Dao Master could do!" Zheng Xin and others watched Luo Tian standing there. Their eyes bore joy. As Luo Tian's life-and-death brothers, the stronger Luo Tian was, the happier they felt.

As for competing with Luo Tian, they hadn't even considered it. As they put it, who could compete with a prodigy?

"Almost there!" Luo Tian muttered softly. He felt the remaining faint Dao Mark in his dantian, a smile on his face.

"Boom... Boom..." Luo Tian struck again with a palm. A golden hand, vast and mighty, pressed down on the heavens and earth, surging toward the ancient clans.

The golden hand radiated divine might. The pressure caused the ancient clans' people to tremble in fear, their bodies shaking. Some with low cultivation bent their knees and knelt beneath the starry sky.

It was instinctive. At this moment, Luo Tian's aura was no different from that of the kings of the ancient clans.

"Ah..." The remaining beings who had lived a second life and prodigies bore resentment. They roared desperately, trying to break free from the immense pressure. But no matter how powerful they were, against the golden hand, they were helpless. They knew Luo Tian's rise was unstoppable.

Any means would be as useless as a chicken against the might of Luo Tian. After all, even combined efforts with the Era's Treasure had only caused him to bleed slightly.

"Boom... Boom..." Blood mist surged. Clusters of blood mist rose among the ancient clans' people.

It lasted for a quarter of an hour before the explosions finally ceased. With that single palm strike, Luo Tian had killed and wounded countless of the ancient clans.

"Didn't kill them all!" Jiang Nanxuan and others gazed at the direction of the ancient clans, their eyes filled with confusion.

"Correct. Those who died were all Luo Tian's enemies and those who had attacked us, nearly killing us!" Jiang Sxi bore a slight smile. She gazed at Luo Tian.

"Having great power but not being bloodthirsty—this is Luo Tian!" The human race's people bore admiration.

"I'm not dead!" Tu Feiyang and the nine princes of the Golden Crow clan, among other prodigies, bore disbelief. They gazed at Luo Tian standing there, surprised he hadn't killed them.

"This battle is over!" A dignified voice echoed. Luo Tian gazed at the remaining ancient clans' people and spoke aloud.

Indeed, Luo Tian had held back slightly in that palm strike. His perspective had changed now. He knew the ancient clans couldn't be exterminated. If he destroyed them all, it would affect his Dao heart. Moreover, a mysterious feeling told him that if he did so, something terrible might happen.

"This must be the reason why the kings of ancient times didn't destroy the human race, even when they were weak," Luo Tian sighed longingly.

Although Luo Tian hadn't killed all the royal clan people, that palm strike had eliminated all of his enemies. Now, among the ancient clans, only the Star Moon Clan and the蛮族 had beings who had lived a second life. The royal offspring were only left in the Golden Crow clan, Star Moon Clan, and蛮族.

"From now on, all clans will coexist. You'll still live in the雷域 and冥域, three star domains. Do you have any objections?" Luo Tian addressed the ancient clans.

"No!" The ancient clans dared not object. In the next era, they had suffered heavy losses; the human race was destined to rise.

"Boom..." As the ancient clans' people spoke, a thunderous explosion echoed in space. A powerful energy surged outward.

Luo Tian's eyes were serious. Even he felt a sense of fear before this overwhelming power—completely surpassing the nine domains.

Luo Tian's hands moved. Waves of energy descended upon the human race and ancient clans before the power swept over them, teleporting everyone out of Xing Luo Domain.

"Buzz..." As everyone disappeared, a cataclysmic wave surged outward. Space was annihilated and spread rapidly.

"Xing Luo Domain and Shui Luo Domain are gone!" Thousands of figures appeared in the Divine Beast Domain. Their faces bore fear, gazing at Shui Luo Domain turned into a gray expanse.

"Damn it! Our Shui Luo City!" Yan Hongtao and the people of Shui Luo Domain bore sorrow, watching their entire domain annihilated. They howled in despair.

They didn't believe Shui Luo City would remain intact.

"Be grateful. You're lucky you weren't in Shui Luo Domain!" The people bore admiration, watching the annihilated star domain.

"Now comes the real battle—Luo Tian's battle. If he wins, nine domains will enter a peaceful era. If he loses, that evil spirit might annihilate the entire nine domains!" The people bore worry, gazing at Luo Tian standing in that wave of power.

"Alas..." The ancient clans' people bore bitterness. They felt regret for opening the burial coffin. If Luo Tian truly lost, with that evil spirit's coldness, it might indeed annihilate the nine domains' life.

"Pu..." A golden barrier. Zhang Daotian spat out blood, his face pale as paper. His eyes bore a weak expression.

After the thunderous explosion, five figures flew out of the center in disarray. Luo Tian's heart tensed.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian waved his hand, a golden hand catching the five disheveled figures.

"What about coexistence among clans? Did I agree to that? I'll make this small world no longer exist!" A cold and evil voice echoed. A withered body appeared in Luo Tian's vision, dark blood flowing from the evil spirit's lips. His eyes were fierce as he gazed at the five disheveled figures and Luo Tian.

The five weren't others. They were Yaozun, Gutianshi, and others who had previously attacked the evil spirit. However, now these five no longer bore their former invincible aura. Their bodies were covered with fierce wounds; their energy was extremely weak.

"Kid, now it's your turn!" Yanzun spoke. His eyes gazed at Luo Tian, flashing with light. He had once been invincible and could sense that Luo Tian's aura was no weaker than his own.

"You've finally reached this point!" Gutianshi and others coughed up blood, their eyes filled with satisfaction. They had watched Luo Tian grow to this point and regarded him as their junior.

"Always you protected me. Now it's my turn to shield you!" Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Zhang Daotian and others. They were the people he respected most. Previously, his strength wasn't enough, but now he had the qualifications to say this.

"Arrogant kid. What do you have to shield them?" The evil spirit bore a mocking expression. Though Luo Tian felt strong, the evil spirit was confident his body could crush anything.

"Kill you and attain the Dao!" Luo Tian sent Zhang Daotian and others out of Xing Luo Domain. He gazed at the evil spirit, his battle spirit rising.

"Buzz..." A golden Rending Sky Spear appeared in Luo Tian's hand, radiating cold sharpness. The Heaven's Will Thunder Sword hovered above his head, with waves of lightning falling. He looked like a true god, gazing at the evil spirit.

An invisible wave rose before Luo Tian and the evil spirit. The sound of collision echoed between them, but they hadn't yet struck.

"Does Luo Tian have a chance?" Gutianshi and others stood in the Divine Beast Domain, their eyes filled with deep concern.

"If it's impossible, I have another move. My disciple won't die!" Zhang Daotian's eyes bore depth.

"Can't kill the immortal realm, can't personally slaughter that old bastard of eternal life!" Zhang Daotian muttered to himself.

On the other side, Luo Tian and the evil spirit continued to stare at each other. The Xing Luo Domain fell silent, as if time had stopped. Only the sound of collision echoed between them.

Time passed slowly. The two stood for nearly an hour, their auras rising to the peak. In默契 (mutual understanding), they both moved simultaneously.

"Buzz..." A black small sword fell into the evil spirit's hand. In the next moment, the evil spirit vanished from his spot and appeared before Luo Tian. The black sword's light surged, slicing downward toward Luo Tian.

"Crack..." Luo Tian held the Rending Sky Spear in his hands, lifting it to block. The collision of sharp edges echoed again. A firelight rose from the Rending Sky Spear, and Luo Tian's body was pushed downward. His palm felt a series of divine patterns.

The ultimate collision— the evil spirit's body was also hurled backward. His crimson eyes bore a hint of surprise, then turned serious.

"His body is strong, but still one level below that old immortal's!" The evil spirit took another step. His body moved like a ghost, appearing before the descending Luo Tian again. The black small sword sliced downward.

"Open!" Luo Tian felt the evil spirit's difficulty in the first collision. He secretly admired how Yanzun and others had resisted for so long against the evil spirit.

At the same time, Luo Tian again raised his hand. The golden Rending Sky Spear collided with the black small sword.

"Cough... Cough..." This time, Luo Tian's body retreated again. Golden blood flowed from his mouth. The Rending Sky Spear had a slight mark.

Chapter 1749: Suicide

"Again!" Luo Tian's face bore a look of frustration. He didn't retreat but charged toward the evil spirit. However, the evil spirit hadn't noticed that a glint of light flashed in Luo Tian's eyes.

"Suicide!" The evil spirit wouldn't fear Luo Tian. Though they had only clashed twice, the evil spirit now knew Luo Tian's strength—his body was strong and his power great. But compared to the evil spirit, he still fell short. If it weren't for Yanzun and others injuring the evil spirit, the evil spirit was confident he could kill Luo Tian in a few strikes.

As they spoke, the two clashed again. Luo Tian continuously swung his Rending Sky Spear, using it as a long staff to strike the evil spirit.

The thunderous sound of collision echoed. A powerful energy constantly swept out, causing those in the Divine Beast Domain to feel fear. Except for Zhang Daotian and others who had lived a second life, no one could see the battle between Luo Tian and the evil spirit. They only felt a terrifying energy sweeping out, surpassing the nine domains' capacity.

"Crack..." The sound of breaking continued. In a moment, Luo Tian and the evil spirit clashed several times. Each collision sent Luo Tian flying backward, but he seemed to grow stronger with each battle. Even as he was hurled back, he continued to charge toward the evil spirit.

"One strike... two strikes..."

Time passed slowly. In a moment, Luo Tian had struck 108 times. The evil spirit's body only retreated several steps.

In contrast, Luo Tian's face was pale; his arms had cracked multiple times. The Rending Sky Spear, due to continuous collisions, had lost its luster. After all, the Rending Sky Spear was still within the realm of Era Treasures, while the evil spirit's black small sword surpassed Era Treasures and was comparable to a lower-grade immortal weapon.

"Kid, what other moves do you have? Use them!" The evil spirit bore contempt. He gazed at Luo Tian, whose face was pale.

"If you don't have any more moves, then you can die!" The evil spirit spoke coldly. His black small sword was raised before him, emitting an invisible wave.

"Bursting Heaven's Eight Swords!" The evil spirit roared. A surge of blood energy erupted from his hand, and a black sword energy burst forth from the evil spirit's small sword.

"Bursting Heaven's Eight Swords!" Zhang Daotian's face changed. He watched the black sword energy sweeping across the sky, shouting at Luo Tian: "Be careful! This was my martial art!"

"Feeling like fighting your master again!" Luo Tian watched the black sword energy, his mouth curling. He put away the Rending Sky Spear and took up the Heaven's Will Thunder Sword.

"Buzz..." Immortal energy rushed into the Heaven's Will Thunder Sword. A humming sound rose from it.

"Dao has no limits!" He roared, and waves of lightning swords burst forth. They carried a tremendous wave, sweeping toward the black sword energy.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." Waves of swords collided between Luo Tian and the evil spirit, their waves spreading before them.

"Second sword!" The evil spirit bore a cold face. He didn't care that his attack was blocked by Luo Tian. At the same time, another black sword energy burst forth from the evil spirit's small sword. This time, it wasn't sweeping toward Luo Tian but merging together to form a Heaven-Splitting Sword.

Black mist spread from the sword energy, surpassing rules. It carried a tremendous wave and sliced toward Luo Tian.

"Blade has no limits!" Luo Tian felt the black sword energy carried an annihilating intent. His heart trembled slightly. Even he felt a strong sense of crisis, but he could only grit his teeth and endure. Four-colored lightning burst from the Heaven's Will Thunder Sword, then merged together to form a four-color sword energy. Luo Tian moved with the sword and vanished from his spot.

In the next moment, the collision sound echoed again. In Zhang Daotian's group's sight, Luo Tian held the four-color Heaven's Will Thunder Sword and collided with the Heaven-Splitting black sword energy. Two ultimate attacks clashed, divine laws spreading outward.

"So变态!" Everyone's hearts trembled. They felt a power so strong it made them feel despair. After all, Luo Tian had been so强势 (strong), killing beings who had lived a second life like slaughtering chickens.

But now he was being suppressed by the evil spirit. From their battle, the evil spirit's body hadn't moved much. However, Luo Tian now bore wounds.

Two massive sword energies clashed and destroyed each other. But Luo Tian's body was sent flying by the powerful wave, bearing several black wounds from the residual impact.

"Third sword!" The evil spirit didn't give Luo Tian any chance to catch his breath. His black small sword emitted a powerful wave, its dark light flashing. It surged from the evil spirit's hand and was stronger than the previous second sword.

"God-Forged Wrath, Trampling Nine Heavens!" Luo Tian roared. His hands formed seals. His body surged and expanded, opening the Law of the Universe. His massive body instantly grew to a thousand zhang. With one step forward, complex seals appeared on his thighs—Buddha's Attack and One Force to Break All.

Luo Tian's current strength, when he unleashed the God-Forged Trample, was terrifying. It was as if a god of the蛮族 had returned, stomping through stars and galaxies, his hands grasping suns and moons. His entire body radiated a powerful aura.

The golden foot collided with the black sword energy, blood splattering. Even with his strongest state open, the golden foot was shattered by the black sword energy. Luo Tian's body was sent flying backward.

"Too strong! This cursed mark—when will it be fully refined!" Luo Tian's heart ached as he flew backward. He felt his body was slow to refine the last bit of the Dao Mark.

In fact, Luo Tian had noticed during his battle with the ancient clans' people that the Dao Mark in his dantian, though only a bit, was being refined slowly. However, after clashing with the evil spirit, he had discovered that the last bit of the Dao Mark was refining faster.

As he continued to fly backward, his shattered right leg rapidly healed. However, a powerful sense of crisis made Luo Tian's heart tremble.

"Ugh..." A groaning sound echoed. As Luo Tian's heart shook, the black sword energy sliced toward him again.

"God-Forged Sixth Trample Shatters Stars!" Luo Tian quickly stabilized his body. He took the second step forward, and with it, his aura increased slightly.

"Boom..." It was like a replay of the previous scene. Luo Tian's body flew backward again, his face pale this time.

"Seventh sword..." The evil spirit continuously swung his sword. Luo Tian took the sixth step forward, but each time he was wounded more severely.

"Eighth sword..."

"God-Forged Fifth Trample Over the World!" Luo Tian and the evil spirit spoke simultaneously. Under Zhang Daotian's group's concern, Luo Tian collided with the evil spirit's seventh sword.

"Boom..." Luo Tian's body flew backward, deep wounds appearing on his body. This strike almost split him in two.

"It's over!" The evil spirit sneered, watching Luo Tian's body falling toward the starry sky. This time, he didn't revive.

"Annihilation!" The evil spirit roared. His black sword energy pierced through the chaotic starry sky, aiming to cut everything down. The entire gray starry sky trembled suddenly. Those two crimson Dao eyes opened again through the gray mist, people could clearly feel a sense of fear in those crimson eyes.

"God-Forged Sixth Trample Moves the Universe!" As that black sword energy flew out, Luo Tian's body finally recovered. His entire body seemed to be on fire. He roared and took the sixth step forward, without any fear, stepping toward that black sword energy.

"Is Luo Tian crazy!" Everyone's faces bore shock. They watched the battered Luo Tian, who still stepped toward that black sword energy.

"Boom..." Blood mist surged. The massive body was shattered by the black sword energy, golden divine blood spilling across space, appearing extremely eye-catching.

"Finished..." Everyone watched the blood mist of Luo Tian and felt despair. Even the strongest Luo Tian couldn't defeat the evil spirit. Who else could stop the evil spirit?

"Come with me, die!" The evil spirit's eyes bore coldness. He gazed at the golden blood, slowly gathering together. He waved his black small sword.

"Ultimately, it's still time to take that step!" Zhang Daotian watched the evil spirit had started. He muttered, then waved his hand. A golden sword energy appeared in Zhang Daotian's hands.

"Want to harm my disciple? First ask me!" Zhang Daotian's body flew upward. He spoke coldly, emitting a powerful aura.

"Unfortunately, I just came back to life and now have to die again! Truly regretful!" Zhang Daotian's sword energy surged.

"What are you doing?" The evil spirit stopped. He gazed at Zhang Daotian's flying body, a sudden bad feeling in his heart.

"Suicide!" Zhang Daotian's face bore a smile. The golden sword energy surged toward his body.

"What!" Hearing Zhang Daotian's words, everyone's faces bore disbelief. They gazed at Zhang Daotian, whose eyes held determination. They hadn't expected Zhang Daotian to commit suicide.

"I see now! This evil spirit is originally from the same source as Zhang Daotian. It's a manifestation of Zhang Daotian's body. If Zhang Daotian dies, this evil spirit might also not survive," Dongbo Xin's face bore shock as he spoke.

Chapter 1750: Attaining the Dao

"Indeed!" Everyone's faces bore shock. They watched Zhang Daotian, who had already moved the golden sword energy toward himself.

"Zhang Daotian, are you willing to die? You still have a grudge to settle. Are you truly content? If I devour you, I'll definitely avenge your grudge in the immortal realm!" The evil spirit roared. He watched the golden sword energy approaching himself, his bad feeling stronger.

"My disciple will definitely avenge me!" Zhang Daotian's face bore a smile. He gazed at the golden sword energy approaching his chest, his voice filled with relief.

Zhang Daotian's speed was too fast. No one expected him to pull this move suddenly.

In an instant, the golden sword energy pierced Zhang Daotian's chest. Everyone's faces bore despair. Even the evil spirit's face was filled with madness, his body flying toward Zhang Daotian to stop him.

"Buzz..." However, just as the golden sword energy pierced Zhang Daotian's chest, waves rose from the direction of Luo Tian's blood.

Time froze. The entire world was still. Everyone's faces bore shock, standing there without moving. They couldn't move their bodies.

Although they stopped moving, their eyes could still see the direction of Luo Tian.

In the golden divine blood, a tiny mark burst open. An invisible wave flowed over the golden blood. In an instant, a tremendous pressure surged across space.
