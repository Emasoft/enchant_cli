“你……” Huang Youshan’s face darkened further, his gaze fixed intently on Luotian. At this moment, he realized that Luotian had acted deliberately; his true goal was to obtain the Jade Slip. Though he had borrowed five million spiritual stones from the auction hall, Huang Youshan knew Luotian could do the same—especially with Ye Liangchen’s help.

“130 million times!” The old man’s hammer fell, as if striking Huang Youshan’s heart.

“Good! Good! Good!” Huang Youshan repeated the word three times, nodding. He extended his hand, and the Jade Slip he had just acquired transformed into a streak of light, flying toward Luotian.

“Thank you!” Luotian laughed, catching the Jade Slip and tossing his storage bag to Huang Youshan.

Chapter 1899: Dragon Egg

“Barbarian God’s Battle Song!” Without hesitation, Luotian imprinted the Jade Slip onto his forehead. His eyes closed as he sat cross-legged on a soft sofa.

“Can he actually read the Jade Slip?” Seeing Luotian’s action, the纨绔 in the private room—Ye Liangchen included—wore expressions of shock.

“Five million spiritual stones for a high-level martial art or technique—it’s a huge profit!” Ye Liangchen displayed admiration.

“Haha, if Huang Youshan knew, he’d spit blood!” The other纨绔 laughed as well. Luotian’s guess was correct; these aristocrats were divided into factions. Ye Liangchen was their leader.

Huang Youshan and the others were more amicable with another faction, whose leader was Wan Yushe. However, Wan Yushe hadn’t attended this auction.

“Barbarian, conquering the eight directions… unyielding…” A deep voice echoed in Luotian’s mind. He felt as if he had entered another world, where towering barbarian giants roared and marched through the heavens. Their passage shattered stars, while a middle-aged giant stood at their center, reciting the same deep voice. This resonated with Luotian’s mind, radiating an invisible wave over the surrounding giants.

“Boom… boom… boom…” As Luotian marveled, Ye Liangchen and the others widened their eyes. They gazed at Luotian, who was now covered in intricate seals. Their senses detected his power growing steadily, waves of energy radiating outward.

“Damn it… Tiange, can you not train here!” Ye Liangchen and the others cried out. Under this power, they felt as if in a brutal battlefield, facing millions of ironclad soldiers. How could these aristocrats withstand it?

“Barbarian, lifting mountains…” Luotian recited in his mind, awestruck by the images in his head.

Luotian had seen war before and experienced countless battles. He was familiar with the battlefield, but he had never witnessed such an ironclad army in his mind. The barbarians were born for war.

“Barbarian God’s Battle Song—this was my eighth battle’s inspiration. It recalls the days I led my people in war. Regrettably, now only one remains. May this song ensure our tribe’s eternal prosperity. Though the tribe may perish, its soul, will, and spirit shall never die!” A deep voice echoed in Luotian’s mind. He slowly opened his eyes.

“Barbarian God, truly a master! If this battle song were spread across the Nine Domains and performed for our tribe, it would elevate them to a new level!” Luotian mused, understanding the song’s purpose.

“Boosting morale and battle spirit, converting it into boundless combat power. In a narrow encounter, the bold prevail!” Luotian murmured, realizing this battle song enhanced not only his strength but also that of allies within a ten-mile radius.

“This technique itself is nothing special, but in battle, its effect would be terrifying!” Luotian mused. He then withdrew his thoughts and noticed Ye Liangchen staring at him as if he were a monster, pale and trembling in the corner.

“What’s wrong?” Luotian asked, puzzled by their stares.

“Tiange… you were truly terrifying just now. It felt like facing a million soldiers!” Ye Liangchen said, trembling as he stood up.

“Sorry… I didn’t expect it to be so loud. I scared you…” Luotian showed a hint of apology.

“130 million times!” As Ye Liangchen prepared to speak again, the auctioneer’s voice echoed in their ears. Their faces shifted slightly.

At that moment, when Luotian had just sat cross-legged, the auction had revealed its final item. Its price had soared to 130 million.

“140 million!” Ye Liangchen quickly shouted. If they delayed, the dragon egg would belong to another. Returning to his sect, his father might kill him.

“Damn it, Ye Liangchen, you’ve been silent for so long. I thought you didn’t want it!” The crowd was startled.

Since the dragon egg had been unveiled, this private room had remained silent. People didn’t know what happened inside. They assumed Ye Liangchen had suddenly lost interest or been enchanted by the red-robed attendant.

“Rubbish! Could I not want it? I just didn’t feel like speaking earlier!” Ye Liangchen wouldn’t back down, shouting in return.

“Let’s continue!” The other aristocrats resumed their bidding. This time it was even more ruthless, each increment causing people to gasp. These men were adding one million spiritual stones at a time.

“True wealth!” Luotian now understood what true wealth meant. Within an hour, the price skyrocketed to two hundred million spiritual stones. Ye Liangchen still stood there, unyielding, staring at the others. Only two remained in contention.

“I advise you not to challenge me… I might just abandon it!” Ye Liangchen declared, raising the price to two hundred and ten million. His heart trembled; he feared others might deliberately overbid, like Huang Youshan had done.

“Two hundred and ten million!” Ye Liangchen said, adding another ten million. He gazed at the other two aristocrats.

Seeing Ye Liangchen’s determination, the two men hesitated. Though the dragon egg was rare, two hundred and ten million spiritual stones were a staggering sum. Even if they won it, nurturing the egg would cost much. Whether it could be cultivated was uncertain. Moreover, their spiritual stones were nearly depleted.

“Two hundred and ten million! Two hundred and ten million!” The auctioneer cleared his throat, declaring the dragon egg’s ownership.

A golden dragon egg, as large as a millstone, was carried into the private room. Ye Liangchen’s face lit up with joy. His gaze turned to the dragon egg, as did Luotian’s.

“Big brother, this dragon shares my blood!” Long Jie’s voice echoed in Luotian’s mind. His face shifted slightly.

“Dragon Emperor blood!” Luotian gazed at the dragon egg, knowing that Star River Sect had gained a fortune. If this dragon matured, it would become a formidable power.

“However, this dragon seems to have encountered misfortune. Its aura is extremely weak. If mishandled, it might perish!” Long Jie’s voice returned.

“What should I do?” Luotian detected sorrow in Long Jie’s tone. Bloodlines as rich as his were rare. Meeting one was already exceptional. Long Jie didn’t want this dragon to die.

“Big brother, drip a drop of your essence blood onto the egg. Our bloodlines are connected; it could save its life!” Long Jie’s voice echoed in Luotian’s mind.

“Good!” Luotian nodded, stepping toward the golden dragon egg. He extended a finger, and a drop of golden essence blood fell onto it.

“Tiange, what are you doing? This is my money!” Ye Liangchen gasped at Luotian’s action. But the drop of life-giving blood had already merged into the egg, instantly absorbed.

“Roar…” As the essence blood entered the egg, a series of roars echoed within. A powerful suction arose from the egg, instantly devouring all spiritual energy in the room. The suction extended outward.

The entire auction hall… the entire Huan Tian Island…

A crack appeared on the dragon egg. Spiritual energy, drawn by the fissure, flowed into it.

“Not… not about to emerge?” Ye Liangchen stared at the crack, excitement on his face. He imagined riding a true dragon in the future—how formidable!

Yet he soon became disappointed. The egg had only cracked slightly, not fully. However, people sensed a powerful vitality reviving, stronger than before. They could see an image of a dragon within the egg, moving about.

“Haha, Tiange, I don’t know what you did, but thank you! Give me another two drops!” Ye Liangchen grinned at Luotian.

“Go to hell…” Luotian’s face was pale. He kicked Ye Liangchen away, then smiled: “The auction is over. I’ll be leaving now. Ye Liangchen, when you reach the Middle Heavens, take care of me!”

“Don’t worry, Tiange. If anyone dares to harm you, just say my name Ye Liangchen—surely it’ll work!” Ye Liangchen made another promise. He carefully stored the dragon egg, hurriedly heading to the teleportation site. After all, it had cost a fortune; if anything went wrong, his father wouldn’t forgive him.

Luotian also smiled as he exited the auction hall. He saw Huang Youshan walking out with a dark face, his killing intent unhidden. Though he dared not touch Ye Liangchen, Luotian was no threat here—though not on Huan Tian Island.

“Haha, chase me if you dare!” Luotian thought coldly. He actually hoped Huang Youshan would chase him, as he preferred that bow.

Luotian waited a while. Cen Weihong emerged from the auction hall, his legs trembling, face pale and drained.

“Nephew, you must be moderate. After all, health is the foundation of revolution!” Luotian patted Cen Weihong’s shoulder. He felt Cen Weihong’s resentment and pressure had lessened.

Chapter 1900: Entering the Middle Heavens

The Immortal Realm was vast. To enter the Middle Heavens from the Lower Heavens, one had to cross the Huan Tian Sea. But this sea was boundless; even a Celestial Immortal would take five months to fly across. Huan Tian Island forbade Lower Heavens people from entering the Middle Heavens unless under special circumstances.

Huan Tian Island’s center had a massive altar. This was the only way for Lower Heavens people to enter the Middle Heavens.

At this moment, Luotian and Xuan Dan stood with nine others at the altar. They gazed at it, Luotian’s heart trembling. He still had a deep fear of teleportation arrays—this fear never left him, even when he became the Epoch Lord in the Nine Domains.

“Alright, everyone. I hope your next visit to Huan Tian Island is pleasant. I’ll now activate the teleportation array!” Liu Yueming smiled, indicating Luotian and Xuan Dan could step onto the array.

After yesterday’s auction, Ye Liangchen and other aristocrats had taken the teleportation array to the Middle Heavens. Luotian’s group chose today.

“Let’s go, entering the Middle Heavens. Everyone must be sincere in their words and actions!” Xuan Dan reiterated, especially looking at Luotian. After these days together, he knew this kid was a troublemaker. Once his limits were touched, Luotian wouldn’t care who they were—he’d hit them all.

Luotian smirked, following Xuan Dan. The group stepped onto the altar, waiting for Liu Yueming to activate it.

“Xuan Dan, safe travels!” Liu Yueming smiled, then waved his hands. Golden light flew from his hands. The ancient altar activated, and the teleportation force took effect on Luotian’s group.

“Finally in the Middle Heavens. That grudge is about to be settled!” Luotian sneered, glancing at Zhang Jinghuan and Du Chengshi.

Zhang Jinghuan and Du Chengshi also wore smirks. Their eyes flashed with killing intent, clearly their goal was to eliminate Luotian in the Middle Heavens.

“Buzz…” The teleportation’s waves affected Luotian and his group. Space twisted, and they vanished from the altar.

Dizziness overtook Luotian. A moment later, the feeling of solid ground returned, restoring his awareness.

“Who invented teleportation arrays? Can’t they fix this problem?” Luotian cursed inwardly, but his gaze swept the surroundings.

“Welcome to the Middle Heavens. This is Huan Tian City. Hope you enjoy your stay!” As Luotian and the group regained their senses, a gentle voice echoed in their ears.

“Seems Huan Tian City is also under Huan Tian Island’s control!” Luotian smiled, relieved that his teleportation had no issues.

But as soon as they landed, several figures vanished around the altar. Luotian’s brows furrowed slightly; Xuan Dan also grew serious.

“So many?” Luotian hadn’t expected so many to target him. He thought only two or three factions would.

“As long as it’s not a group of True Immortals, I have a chance!” Luotian smirked. He and Xuan Dan exchanged glances, then nodded.

“Transporting ascended individuals is more important. Let’s just move on!” Xuan Dan spoke, taking out a map. The map had various marks indicating sect names—this was the distribution of sects in the Middle Heavens.

“We want to go to Star River Sect. At our pace, it’ll take about half a month. Along the way, we might pass some sects. Try not to engage with them!” Xuan Dan warned again, then led Luotian out of Huan Tian City.

Luotian examined the map. His gaze locked on a location named Yingchou Gully. To reach Star River Sect, they took the shortest path. This gully was a necessary route. Luotian was certain that if ambushed, it would be here.

They didn’t linger in Huan Tian City. As soon as they exited, they followed the map toward Star River Sect.

“Kid, really bold not to go with Ye Liangchen into the Middle Heavens. These Lower Heavens dirtbags are really bold!” As Luotian’s group took off, several figures appeared outside Huan Tian City. They watched the group leave and activated their tokens to contact others.

No words were exchanged on the journey. Seven days passed without incident. Luotian’s group hadn’t drawn attention in the Middle Heavens. Though Xuan Dan and others were True Immortals, True Immortal beginners were common in the Middle Heavens. Often, sects sent True Immortal elders with disciples for training.

Yingchou Gully—vast mountains appeared in Luotian’s group’s view. Their faces slightly shifted, sensing an odd magic from these mountains, a strange atmosphere, and oppressive air.

“Be careful. This is likely a good ambush spot. Spiritual senses are suppressed,” Xuan Dan warned Luotian.

Xuan Dan led the group into Yingchou Gully. Soon, they reached its center.

“Won’t you strike?” Luotian gazed around. At this moment, the group was surrounded by mountains stretching endlessly. Even Luotian’s spiritual senses were significantly suppressed.

“Buzz…” As Luotian pondered, Zhang Jinghuan’s eyes flashed with cruelty. Unnoticed, he stood behind Xuan Dan.

“Master beware!” Seeing Zhang Jinghuan’s move, Luotian frowned and transmitted a warning to Xuan Dan.

“Huh?” Xuan Dan looked puzzled but detected no anomaly.

“Buzz…” As Xuan Dan was confused, Zhang Jinghuan moved. After long preparation, he struck with a palm toward Xuan Dan’s back. This strike was confident—though Xuan Dan wouldn’t die, he’d be severely injured. Zhang Jinghuan believed Xuan Dan was a cultivator who excelled in alchemy, not combat.

“Master beware!” Cen Weihong shouted. But before his voice could leave, Zhang Jinghuan’s palm struck Xuan Dan’s back.

“Boom…” A heavy sound echoed. The golden palm struck Xuan Dan’s back solidly.

Though Luotian wanted to rescue, he was only a True Immortal intermediate. In that moment, Xuan Dan spat blood and turned with anger.

“Zhang Jinghuan!” Xuan Dan flew dozens of feet, bloodstained robes. He turned to Zhang Jinghuan with teeth gritted.

“Xuan Dan, blame yourself for being too prominent. You shouldn’t have involved in sect affairs. If you had stayed quiet, this wouldn’t have happened!” Zhang Jinghuan’s face was grotesque. He gazed at Xuan Dan.

“Master!” Cen Weihong moved toward Xuan Dan. But before he could act, a figure blocked his path and slashed with a long sword.

“Burst…” The sword was fast, but Luotian was faster. He stepped through space and appeared before Cen Weihong, punching the golden sword.

“Ke Zhenghao!” Cen Weihong gazed at the one who attacked him—Ke Zhenghao. Meanwhile, Du Chengshi stood behind Xuan Dan, eyes filled with killing intent.

“Xuan Dan, now swear allegiance to me. I might let you live. Otherwise, this gully will be your grave!” Zhang Jinghuan smiled. He believed the situation was entirely under his control.

Xuan Dan was wounded, and Luotian and Cen Weihong were only True Immortal beginners. Zhang Jinghuan saw them as ants to crush.

“Are you trying to keep us here?” Xuan Dan’s pale face gazed at Zhang Jinghuan and Du Chengshi, his eyes cold.

“Haha, there’s nothing left to say. We must eliminate you. This kid is too annoying!” Zhang Jinghuan’s face was resolute, gazing at Luotian and Xuan Dan.

“Why are you two conspiring together?” Xuan Dan’s pale face gazed at Du Chengshi and Zhang Jinghuan. Ke Zhenghao stood beside them.

“Does it matter? Today, you both are doomed!” Zhang Jinghuan’s face was cold. His aura rose.

“Do you think I have no precautions? Haha, thinking you hit my back and I’m dead?” Xuan Dan smiled. He took out a pill, placed it in his mouth.

“Old man, I’m different from commoners. My heart is on the left!” Xuan Dan smiled, gazing at Zhang Jinghuan and three others.

“What!” Hearing Xuan Dan’s words, Zhang Jinghuan was stunned. But he soon returned to normal.

“What does it matter? We are two True Immortal beginners. Killing you is easy!” Zhang Jinghuan’s face was confident.

“Still so confident?” Luotian spoke, gazing around. He rebuked: “The sects of the Middle Heavens are all cowards, aren’t they? Who wants my life, come out!”

“Haha, kid, do you remember me? I didn’t kill you in Huan Tian City. Now I have the chance!” The void trembled. Huang Youshan’s face was grotesque, with two True Immortal beginners behind him.

Huang Yousuan’s words had just finished when waves spread. Several figures appeared around Luotian’s group, some concealing their faces.

“Kid, hand over the Jade Slip you obtained. Translate it for me, and we’ll leave immediately!” A cold voice echoed.

Chapter 1901: Battle with Ke Zhenghao

Endless mountains. A figure stood in the sky. Luotian and two others stood there, surrounded by many powerful figures.

“Those people must be with Ye Liangchen’s aristocrats. I wonder how many there are!” Luotian mused, thinking about how to handle the situation. Though he guessed Nan Gong Yuqing would ambush here, what if there was no ambush?

“Fifteen True Immortal beginners. This could destroy three sects. What grudge? What hatred? Just for a Barbarian God’s Battle Song, they want me dead?” Luotian sneered. His eyes were filled with killing intent. Though he was now a True Immortal intermediate, Luotian was confident in handling some crises. He wasn’t the soft target he once was.

“Unexpectedly, you Lower Heavens scum started fighting among yourselves!” The fifteen people wore disdain. As Middle Heavens sects, they looked down on Lower Heavens people.

“Kill…” Xuan Dan’s face returned to normal. His eyes were angry at Zhang Jinghuan for the ambush.

Xuan Dan’s aura surged, charging toward Zhang Jinghuan with killing intent.

“Haha, Xuan Dan, so many surrounding you. You still want to resist!” Zhang Jinghuan laughed, unafraid of Xuan Dan.

“Boom… boom… boom…”

In an instant, the two clashed. Each strike shook the surroundings.

“Good, unexpectedly Lower Heavens have such a strong warrior. This strength is formidable in the Middle Heavens!” The fifteen surrounding True Immortals smiled, watching Xuan Dan and Zhang Jinghuan fight.

“Xuan Dan…” Zhang Jinghuan’s face darkened. He hadn’t expected Xuan Dan to be so strong. The green fire enveloping Xuan Dan’s body made each attack leave Zhang Jinghuan in disarray.

“Du Chengshi! Come help. Ke Zhenghao, kill Luotian and Cen Weihong!” Zhang Jinghuan shouted, quickly assigning tasks.

“Good!” Du Chengshi moved toward Xuan Dan. Cen Weihong’s face darkened.

“Stupid kid, don’t be impulsive. Your master is here; don’t fear!” Luotian grabbed Cen Weihong, gazing at Ke Zhenghao who approached with a long sword.

“Won’t you act?” Luotian gazed at Huang Youshan’s group. If they joined, he would immediately reveal all his secrets.

“Haha, you’re not worthy. We just want to watch the show. See how it feels to be killed by your peers. Don’t worry, we won’t let you die easily!” Huang Youshan smiled, gazing at Ke Zhenghao who had reached Luotian.

“Ke Zhenghao, True Immortal peak?” Luotian’s eyes gleamed with excitement. His strength had grown again. He wanted to see if he could defeat a True Immortal peak. Others clearly intended to watch them fight among themselves, which suited Luotian’s plan.

“Idiot, go guard those two bastards. The rest are mine!” Luotian told Cen Weihong, his aura surging. He stepped toward Ke Zhenghao.

“Die!” Ke Zhenghao’s face turned colder seeing Luotian approach. He had long noticed Luotian’s uniqueness. Today, with the Dragon Gate gradually rising, much of it was due to Luotian’s presence. So when Zhang Jinghuan said to kill Luotian and Xuan Dan, Ke Zhenghao didn’t hesitate. Killing Luotian was like cutting off Zuo Qiuming’s arms.

“Buzz…” A golden fist struck, colliding with the golden sword. The collision echoed.

Meanwhile, Xuan Dan felt significant pressure. Fighting two opponents of the same level left him in disarray.

“Master, can’t hold out? I’ll use my secret technique!” Luotian collided with Ke Zhenghao, stepping back. He transmitted to Xuan Dan.

“Good!” Xuan Dan was struck by Du Chengshi’s palm, spitting blood. But he still transmitted to Luotian, knowing Luotian had a plan.

“Master!” Seeing Xuan Dan spitting blood, Luotian felt moved. His eyes turned ruthless.

“Ghost-Controlling Seal!” Luotian waved his hands, the Ghost-Controlling Seal flying out. Though it was daytime, it still gave a sinister feeling. The澎湃 ghost energy enveloped everyone, making them shiver.

“Roar…” A black humanoid ghost appeared. Everyone’s faces changed abruptly.

“A spirit creature that appears during the day is a True Immortal ghost!” Someone spoke, voice filled with awe.

“Unexpectedly, this kid has such a thing!” Everyone’s eyes showed greed. They gazed at the Ghost-Controlling Seal hovering over Luotian.

A raspy voice echoed. The ghost’s form moved, gazing at the sun above. Its black eyes glowed with reluctance. Daytime greatly suppressed it, but the ghost still obeyed Luotian’s request, rushing toward Xuan Dan’s battlefield.

“Kid, I didn’t expect you to have this!” Ke Zhenghao frowned, as if recalling something.

“Did you recall something? Yes, the rumors about the Dragon Gate were true!” Luotian soared upward, hands forming seals. He instantly transformed into a hundred-foot giant, charging toward Ke Zhenghao.

“What!” Ke Zhenghao’s face showed disbelief. He hadn’t expected the Dragon Gate’s rumors to be true.

“Hence, Duan Chengfeng refused to cooperate. He must have known Luotian’s strength when he went with him to the Dragon Gate!” Ke Zhenghao instantly understood. He realized why Duan Chengfeng had refused to cooperate.

“Kill this kid! I can’t kill him, but others can!” Duan Chengfeng’s face was frenzied. He hated Luotian more than anyone, for if not for Luotian, he wouldn’t have been planted with a heart demon by Guan Hongsheng.

“Get out of the way…” Ke Zhenghao, though he had raised Luotian’s danger level significantly, saw Luotian’s massive foot and sneered. He swung his sword, emitting golden divine light. He slashed at Luotian’s foot.

“Boom…” Red light flashed. The golden foot collapsed. Luotian’s right leg had a deep wound.

“True Immortal peak is indeed powerful!” Luotian sighed, gazing at Ke Zhenghao. Then he took the seventh step of the Barbarian God’s March.

“Get out…” Ke Zhenghao saw the golden foot. His face finally changed, feeling he faced a true giant. That overwhelming battle spirit terrified him.

Under the opportunity, Ke Zhenghao struck with his sword repeatedly. Golden sword energy swept through the heavens, attacking Luotian.

Boom… boom… boom…

Each sword strike shattered under the golden foot. With each shattering, Luotian’s body released blood mist.

“Cough… cough…” The golden giant collapsed. Luotian returned to normal size, his body covered in wounds. Yet his face was excited, still covered with barbarian patterns. An invisible wave spread around him, enveloping Xuan Dan and the ghost.

“Kill… kill… kill…” Xuan Dan’s face shifted. He felt that with this wave, his spiritual energy became violent, as if he had endless strength.

The ghost was the same. Its black eyes glowed with divine light. Terrorizing black mist enveloped the sky, making even daytime’s suppression of the ghost minimal.

“Narrow encounter—boldness wins!” Luotian roared. He activated the King’s Battle Technique and took up the Immortal Pen. His body vanished, appearing before Ke Zhenghao. The pen’s rod spun, striking down.

“Supreme-grade immortal artifact!” Ke Zhenghao’s face slightly changed. He felt the heavy aura from the pen and became serious. He raised his sword, meeting it.

“Crack…” Next moment, Ke Zhenghao’s body suddenly sank. He fell like a meteor from the sky.

“Boom…” Ke Zhenghao’s body crashed into a mountain, his face pale. His eyes still held disbelief.

Rocks flew, and the thousand-foot mountain was riddled with cracks. From the peak to the base, Ke Zhenghao’s body was embedded in the mountain top. He felt his bones were about to break.

Chapter 1902: I Am the Bird in the Bush

“How could this kid be so strong!” The people of the Middle Heavens were shocked. They hadn’t expected a mere True Immortal intermediate to make a True Immortal peak so desperate.

“It’s because of that pen. It’s the Immortal Pen of Calligraphy!” Some people exclaimed, eyes filled with unhidden greed. Luotian’s treasures exceeded their expectations.

“Not right. A supreme-grade immortal artifact alone couldn’t achieve such power. His strength must surpass True Immortal late-stage!” People discussed again.

“Genius! Such a genius is rare in the Middle Heavens. Even among the Nine Great Immortal Mountains of the Upper Heavens, they would be rare—only a prodigy could reach this level!” People marveled. They hadn’t expected such a person to appear in the Lower Heavens.

“Very satisfied!” Luotian held the Immortal Pen. That strike was his full power—terrific physical strength,梵天攻杀 (Buddha Heaven’s Attack), one force defeating all others. Combined with the Barbarian God’s Battle Song and King’s Battle Technique, it gave him the strength to fight a True Immortal peak.

“Buzz…” The immortal pen waved. Golden spiritual energy flowed, humming as it gathered toward the Immortal Pen.

“Ah…” Ke Zhenghao roared. His eyes turned blood-red, feeling endless shame. A True Immortal peak had been defeated by a True Immortal intermediate. And it was just one strike—he had previously dominated Luotian.

“Buzz…” But as Ke Zhenghao trembled and stood up, the roar of ten thousand soldiers echoed in the heavens.

The golden character “兵” (soldier) thundered down, crushing Ke Zhenghao’s body. The mountain couldn’t withstand it and collapsed, turning into a pile of rubble that buried Ke Zhenghao.

Luotian ignored it. He held the Immortal Pen, his body resembling a calligrapher painting the world. His hands continuously traced, making him appear unusually ethereal.

“Unity of Heaven and Man!” Luotian hadn’t entered this state for a long time. Now, with the intact Immortal Pen in hand, he entered the Unity of Heaven and Man state. The pen became part of his body. Each stroke was naturally smooth.

“Lin… Dou… Zhe…” Three big characters thundered down, striking the pile of rubble.

The thunderous sound shook the heavens. After four booms, the rubble completely turned to dust. Ke Zhenghao’s body was also gone.

“Killed…” A True Immortal intermediate defeating a True Immortal peak. Luotian’s face showed satisfaction.

“Who else wants to die?” Luotian gazed at Huang Youshan and others. His battle spirit hadn’t faded.

“Kid, with your strength, you can’t defeat us. Your strength is good. If you were a True Immortal, even if you were a half-True Immortal, we wouldn’t be your match. But the problem is, you’re just a True Immortal intermediate. We kill you like crushing an ant!”

“Is that so?” Luotian’s face was mocking. He gazed at each True Immortal beginner. After this long, no one had appeared. Luotian now knew the answer.
