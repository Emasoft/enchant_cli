Thinking of this, Luo Tian's battle spirit surged. Golden light radiated from his body, forming into long dragons covering his arms. Without the slightest fear, he charged forward and smashed into the golden staff.

"Boom...!" The thunderous roar echoed beneath the crimson starry sky, invisible waves of energy radiating from Luo Tian and blowing Xu Lizi and Diao Dezhu back.

"Damn..." The two were thrown backward by the shockwave, cursing involuntarily. The collision between Provisional Epoch Lords was too much for them to bear.

"Rrrr..." Seeing Luo Tian under attack, the Three-Headed Dog howled fiercely. Its black body suddenly expanded to dozens of zhang in size, six cold glows erupting from its eyes. The three massive heads seemed to prepare a world-destroying attack.

"Little Black, friend!" Luo Tian smiled and gently patted the Three-Headed Dog's body.

"Little Black..." Hearing Luo Tian name his companion, Diao Dezhu and Xu Lizi blanched. A legendary beast of Provisional Epoch Lord level, even a young one with boundless potential—perhaps surpassing Luo Tian himself—was named like an ordinary dog.

"Luo Tian, where have you been for so long? You didn't contact me!" As Luo Tian's words finished, three figures emerged from the starry void. The leader was Yao Chen.

"Luo Tian?" The two figures behind Yao Chen, upon seeing Luo Tian, their faces slightly changed before showing a hint of joy.

"Come, let me introduce you to my friends from the Shura Domain—this one is Xiu, and this one is Tian Luo. The legendary Shura of the Shura Domain is them!" Yao Chen's eyes flashed with gold as he pointed to his companions.

"Long time no see!" Luo Tian smiled warmly at Xiu's cold expression and Tian Luo's carefree demeanor.

They had once traveled together to the Shura Domain, but Luo Tian hadn't contacted them since. They only met briefly during the invasion of the Ancient Clan.

"Did you know each other?" Yao Chen's face turned puzzled as he looked at Luo Tian.

"Ha! Brother Monkey, we've known each other since long ago—when you were still sleeping!" Diao Dezhu and Xu Lizi flew forward, clapping their chests with Xiu and Tian Luo. Their eyes held smiles.

"Xiu, still so cold-hearted! Can't you at least smile?" Xu Lizi teased Xiu's icy face.

Hearing Xu Lizi, Xiu cracked his lips and smiled at him—but the others shivered involuntarily.

"Brother, don't smile anymore—it's too terrifying!" Xu Lizi watched Xiu's grin and spoke again.

"Ah, so you two are from the Four Sacred Star Domains!" Yao Chen's face lit up as he looked at Luo Tian and his group.

The Four Sacred Star Domains were unknown to Yao Chen, but from the people around Luo Tian, they were clearly no pushovers. Their presence sparked intense curiosity in Yao Chen about what the Four Sacred Star Domains truly were, producing so many prodigies.

"How did you meet?" Diao Dezhu then asked Tian Luo, who was as talkative as Zheng Xin.

"Stop talking! We've been in the Shura Domain all this time, establishing a sect and also a killing organization. We took a contract to assassinate Brother Monkey, so we went to kill him. But we didn't fight—we became friends!"

"Why didn't you tell us when you arrived in the Shura Domain? We would have hosted you!" Tian Luo kept talking, his habit of breaking down around acquaintances resurfacing.

"We're entering the White Bone Forest and don't want you to follow and risk your lives!" Luo Tian smiled at Yao Chen.

"Brother Monkey has ascended to Provisional Epoch Lord?" Luo Tian smiled, but inwardly marveled. He had barely survived the White Bone Forest to reach Provisional Epoch Lord, while Yao Chen in the Shura Domain had also ascended at the same time. His cultivation hadn't lagged behind—Luo Tian couldn't help but admire the terrifying talent and speed of Provisional Epoch Lords.

"I ascended to Epoch Lord because of your two!" Yao Chen smiled at Luo Tian and his companions. "I had been fighting constantly in the Shura Domain, feeling close to breaking through to Provisional Epoch Lord. But I lacked one final opportunity. These two showed up, and in the battle for survival, I broke through!"

"After he became a Provisional Epoch Lord, we two were doomed—beaten repeatedly and chased for a month!" Tian Luo's face showed bitterness.

Even Xiu's expression darkened, recalling that month of torment—his darkest time.

"A month! He didn't kill us, just beat us half-dead and made us rest before beating us again..." Tian Luo nearly cried.

"I was just looking out for you!" Yao Chen shrugged, arms crossed behind his head.

"Thankfully, he sent a message to us. Otherwise, we'd still be suffering!" Tian Luo looked at Luo Tian with gratitude.

Hearing Tian Luo's words, Xu Lizi and Diao Dezhu smiled, especially Diao Dezhu, who had suffered almost as much as Tian Luo and Xiu.

"Little Diao, come on! Your energy seems complete now—close to becoming a Provisional Epoch Lord. Let's spar so you find the breakthrough!" Yao Chen stretched his limbs, eyes on Diao Dezhu.

"Ha ha..." Xu Lizi smiled with relief, looking at Diao Dezhu.

"Don't smile—there's you too, kid! Join in!" Before Xu Lizi could finish speaking, Yao Chen's voice rang out again, making Xu Lizi's face fall.

"Brother Monkey, we're not that close! Don't drag me in!" Xu Lizi frowned at Yao Chen.

"Right, Brother Monkey, since you and Luo Tian are now Provisional Epoch Lords, why don't you two spar?" Diao Dezhu's eyes gleamed, looking at Luo Tian.

Diao Dezhu's words were effective—immediately shifting Yao Chen's attention to Luo Tian, his eyes flashing with excitement.

"Luo Tian, let's fight once. Since we met, I've never fought you!" Yao Chen's face burned with battle spirit, eyes on Luo Tian.

"Likewise!" Luo Tian's battle spirit surged as well, his aura towering, eyes sharp.

Both had just entered Provisional Epoch Lord—this battle would hone their skills and solidify their cultivation.

"Everyone, step back!" Yao Chen ordered the others. Their battle was beyond what they could withstand; if injured, it would be a loss.

Yao Chen's words had barely finished when his golden staff swung out, as if subduing heaven and earth. The heavy aura pressed toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian didn't want to use the Thunder Sword, as using an Epoch Treasure would negate the sparring. But he couldn't ignore Yao Chen's attack. Now, his body itself was his weapon—golden light radiated from him as his invincible flesh and blood roared, clashing with the golden staff.

"Crack..." The thunderous sound echoed as golden lightning rose from their collision, radiating outward.

Their bodies spun around, the starry void shattering under their clash, cracks spreading across the cosmos.

The waves of energy blew against Diao Dezhu's group, their faces changing—earlier collisions were just small skirmishes, but now they fought seriously. The power was even more terrifying.

"Those two are top-tier in Provisional Epoch Lord—this fight, whoever wins, their path to enlightenment will be smoother!" The group murmured, watching Luo Tian and Yao Chen charge at each other again.

"Again! It's been so long since I felt this exhilarating!" Yao Chen laughed, his golden body expanding to thousands of zhang. Standing in the starry void, his staff also expanded, smashing toward Luo Tian. The moves were simple but profound.

Yet this simplicity held countless variations in Luo Tian's eyes, with divine laws flowing through the golden staff as if it were a third hand. The path was unfathomable.

"Brother Monkey, I'm going serious now!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with violet light as he punched repeatedly at the descending staff.

"Buzz..." Golden fists appeared before Luo Tian, colliding with the golden staff repeatedly.

"Haha..." Yao Chen laughed, his body expanding into a thousand zhang, standing in the starry void. His staff swung down with terrifying power.

"Manifesting the Universe!" Luo Tian showed no fear, his hands forming seals as he expanded in size. The two giants seemed to support the cosmos itself, making it tremble before them.

Chapter 1625: Departure ()

The thunderous sound echoed, the entrance to the Shura Domain and the Divine Beast Domain trembled with powerful waves. The collision of Provisional Epoch Lords was described as world-destroying, especially between Luo Tian and Yao Chen. Even the observers Diao Dezhu and others showed awe at the power.

"My god, what do these two eat to be so变态!" Diao Dezhu's group trembled, watching the two massive figures clash and the starry void in ruins.

"Who's fighting? How could there be such terrifying waves? Is it an Ancient Clan Provisional Lord?" The people of the Divine Beast and Shura Domains were stunned, fear in their eyes as they gazed at the entrance.

Yet some bold souls flew toward the battle's direction to find out what was happening.

"Boom... boom... boom..." The starry void kept shattering as Luo Tian and Yao Chen's massive bodies clashed.

"Unmatched, the Battle Saint Ape! Even as a Provisional Epoch Lord, you're so变态 that you can match my flesh without losing!" Luo Tian was awestruck, watching Yao Chen's growing power. His eyes were full of amazement.

Yao Chen was equally amazed by Luo Tian's strength. His flesh was well-known—being the only Battle Saint Ape in the Nine Domains, his bloodline power was formidable. His father was an Epoch Lord, making few in the Nine Domains capable of matching him.

"Unmatched, the human's Reincarnation Body!" Yet Yao Chen felt more exhilaration. A natural lover of battle, he had faced many opponents in his growth. The most exhilarating was the last fight with Chen Zhanbiao. Now, this battle surpassed that one in exhilaration.

"Exhilarating..." Yao Chen said only one word before fully immersing in the battle. His staff movements became even more overwhelming, making Luo Tian feel difficulty in countering.

Luo Tian was equally exhilarated—his opponents had always been either crushing others or being crushed. Never before had he met an equal.

Their bodies bore injuries over time, but it didn't hinder their power.

"Over there! In the Shura Domain!" As they clashed, a clamor arose, making Luo Tian and Yao Chen stop instinctively, exchanging glances.

"Divine Beast's Wrath Shatters the Heavens!" Luo Tian's massive body radiated supreme power, golden seals flowing on his thighs. His golden foot smashed down toward Yao Chen.

Yao Chen immediately understood Luo Tian's intent—Luo Tian used the "Divine Beast's Footstep" to end the battle. If they continued like before, even three days and nights wouldn't decide a winner.

As Yao Chen pondered, Luo Tian's golden foot was already before him. The overwhelming aura from the foot made Yao Chen's face turn serious.

"Staff Sweeps the World!" Yao Chen gripped his staff, his body swaying as if rotating endlessly. A terrifying storm formed, sweeping the stars and colliding with Luo Tian's first step.

The thunderous sound echoed repeatedly as Luo Tian's foot met the storm, gradually eroded by it.

"Divine Beast's Second Step Shatters Stars!" Luo Tian, seeing his foot eroded, took the second step immediately, smashing toward Yao Chen.

"Boom..." Yao Chen's eyes flashed with golden light as a long dragon of seals burst from his staff, covering it. The supreme aura radiated from the staff, even Yao Chen felt strained.

"What is that staff? I feel it could kill me instantly!" Xu Lizi stared at Yao Chen's rotating staff, exclaiming in fear.

"That is a relic left by the Divine Ape Emperor to Yao Chen. It has accompanied him since childhood. It must be no ordinary item!" Diao Dezhu spoke softly, clearly knowing something about Yao Chen.

"Boom..." As the group discussed, Luo Tian and Yao Chen's attacks collided again. This time, both bodies retreated, their massive forms collapsing the stars, vast gray currents from the void crashing onto them.

"Again!" The two spoke simultaneously after stopping, preparing powerful attacks.

"Third Step... Fourth Step... Fifth Step..." Luo Tian kept advancing, each step doubling his power. When he took the fifth step, his aura made Diao Dezhu's group feel immense pressure.

Yao Chen was the same—his golden staff swung endlessly, colliding with Luo Tian's foot. Each time he blocked Luo Tian's attack.

Though both blocked each other's attacks, they were also injured by the battle's aftereffects, with streaks of blood flowing from their bodies.

"Divine Beast's Sixth Step Shatters the Cosmos!" Luo Tian's blood surged, his body wild with fury. The sixth step of the Divine Beast's Footstep was unleashed, smashing toward Yao Chen who stood panting.

"Rrrr..." Yao Chen watched Luo Tian's massive foot, his eyes blazing with battle spirit. Though the sixth step pressed heavily on him, Yao Chen was no stranger to backing down—since birth, he had never retreated from battle. Even against stronger opponents, he had never backed down.

The golden staff radiated terrifying pressure, its heavy aura rising to the heavens. Even an Epoch Peak powerhouse would be crushed by it.

"Staff Shatters the River of Death!" Yao Chen's massive body gripped his heavy staff, veins bulging as he swung it toward Luo Tian's sixth step.

"Buzz..." The next moment, Diao Dezhu's group felt a ringing in their ears and lost hearing. They watched the collision of martial arts, the world-destroying waves enveloping both bodies.

The sea of energy surged skyward, invisible waves radiating outward in all directions.

"My god..." Those who had flown toward the battlefield were blown back by this wave.

"Who!" In the Divine Beast Domain, Sun Shengtian, Sun Feiwen, Nan Gong Yuqing, and Yan Xiu Luo of the Shura Domain's city all changed faces. They stepped out of their sanctuaries, rushing toward Luo Tian and Yao Chen's battle. Such waves were enough to draw their attention, as they felt a strong crisis beneath them.

"Did the Ancient Clan's Provisional Lord come?" The people were puzzled, their eyes filled with concern.

In the Divine Beast Domain, a figure in red robes had an interested look. Her short hair reached her shoulders, and she carried a massive sword disproportionate to her body. If not for careful observation, one would think she was male—but from her figure, she was a woman.

"Shura Domain's entrance? This power should be interesting!" Her clear voice echoed as she transformed into a red light, flying toward the Shura Domain's entrance.

"Again!" Yao Chen roared into the sky, his battle spirit fully ignited by Luo Tian. His body moved, rushing toward Luo Tian again.

"I'm done!" Luo Tian felt several powerful waves approaching their direction, knowing his sparring with Yao Chen had definitely caught the attention of both domains' sanctuaries.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian didn't want to waste time, knowing Yao Chen had entered his zone. If they continued, it would no longer be sparring but a bloodbath.

A powerful spiritual force carried Luo Tian's voice into Yao Chen's mind, making his body tremble slightly.

"Go..." As Luo Tian's voice echoed in Yao Chen's mind, his body stopped, eyes regaining clarity. He also felt several powerful waves approaching them. Though they weren't in top condition, they didn't fear anyone but avoided unnecessary trouble.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian and Yao Chen moved, taking Diao Dezhu and others with them as they vanished into the healing starry void.

Just as Luo Tian's group disappeared, several figures appeared at their previous location.

"Who?" Yan Xiu Luo and Yan Hongtao's faces were grim, looking at the shattered starry void. Their brows furrowed tightly.

"Yan Xiu Luo, who is fighting in your Shura Domain?" Yan Xiu Luo and Yan Hongtao's eyes were filled with disdain. The Divine Clan had long since lost its former prestige, and Yan Hongtao never held much regard for them.

"Nothing... we just came to check!" Sun Shengtian, since his son Sun Miechen disappeared, looked older and grayer but still held immense power. His eyes gazed at Yan Xiu Luo and his son.

"What? Are you planning to fight us?" Yan Xiu Luo's face showed contempt. The Divine Clan was no longer what it once was in terms of prestige and strength.

"No need. The Ancient Clan is our true enemy!" Sun Shengtian shook his head, no longer as sharp as before. His demeanor was more subdued.

"We're leaving!" Sun Shengtian saw nothing and ordered Sun Feiwen to leave. They flew toward the Divine Beast Domain, while Yan Xiu Luo and Yan Hongtao didn't stop them.

"Ah, it's the Divine King and Shura Domain!" However, as Sun Shengtian and Sun Feiwen left, onlookers saw them and showed respect.

"I said it! Who else could cause such a commotion? It's the Divine King!" People murmured, showing respect as they watched Sun Shengtian and Sun Feiwen leave.

"But why did they fight here? Is it another clash between the two sanctuaries?" People then thought of a conclusion, their eyes filled with worry.

"This power wasn't from us!" Yan Xiu Luo spoke, looking at the crowd before ignoring their amazement and vanishing with Yan Hongtao.

"Who is it?" However, as Yan Xiu Luo and Yan Hongtao left, a red figure appeared at the Shura Domain's entrance. The red light blocked Yan Xiu Luo and his son's path.

"Who are you?" Yan Xiu Luo and his son stopped instantly, gazing at the girl-like figure. If not for her feminine features, one would never guess she was a woman. Yet Yan Xiu Luo and Yan Hongtao's eyes held seriousness.

"I don't matter, what matters is I know who you are. You're Yan Hongtao, right?" The girl with short hair and a massive sword on her shoulder looked at Yan Hongtao with provocation.

"Why are you blocking us?" Yan Hongtao scrutinized the girl, then his eyes showed disbelief.

"You're Meng Xue!" Yan Hongtao exclaimed in shock. The Shura Domain's intelligence network was formidable; after recalling, he recognized her.

"Fire Domain's former Epoch Lord's child, Meng Xue?" Yan Xiu Luo's face slightly changed as he looked at Meng Xue.

"Isn't it obvious? The one named Luo Tian is in the Shura Domain, right?" Meng Xue smiled, scanning Yan Xiu Luo and his son.

"What do you want with Luo Tian?" Yan Hongtao asked, puzzled. At the moment, they were on good terms with Luo Tian, and he didn't know that Luo Tian's group had already left the White Bone Forest. Thus, Yan Hongtao wouldn't reveal Luo Tian's whereabouts before knowing her intentions.

"To retrieve what belongs to me!" Meng Xue smiled, then waved her massive sword at Yan Hongtao.

"We don't know where he is!" Yan Hongtao shook his head, guessing this person had no good intentions toward Luo Tian.

"Then I'll find it myself!" Meng Xue's face turned impatient, raising her sword and rushing toward Yan Hongtao and Yan Xiu Luo.

"Die!" Seeing this girl dare to attack them, Yan Xiu Luo and Yan Hongtao's faces turned cold. Their hands flashed with red light, rushing toward Meng Xue.

"Another fight!" People who had been drawn to the battle between Luo Tian and Yao Chen just left, but were now caught by three people's fight. A Provisional Epoch Lord battle wasn't something one could easily witness.

The thunderous sound echoed again in the starry void, but Luo Tian's group didn't know this fight was due to Luo Tian.

At that moment, they transformed into streaks of light flying through the Divine Beast Domain's starry void toward the Fire Domain.

"Another fight!" As they flew, they felt waves from the Shura Domain's entrance constantly transmitting.

"Never mind! Let them fight; we shouldn't get involved!" Luo Tian shook his head, now only wanting to return to the Fire Domain quickly. He needed to deliver the White Bone Bamboo to Ji Jiu You and save Fu Xingyue.

"But Tian Luo, your faces are grim!" Though they flew swiftly, they could still converse normally. Diao Dezhu and Xu Lizi looked at Tian Luo and Xiu's solemn faces, asking.

While Xiu's cold face was acceptable, Tian Luo's state indicated something was wrong.

"Nothing!" Tian Luo shook his head, as if Diao Dezhu and Xu Lizi had touched on a sensitive topic. His eyes flashed with sorrow and intense killing intent.

"Your sect was destroyed, by who?" Yao Chen didn't care, directly revealing the reason for their expressions.

"Don't worry; after I finish my task, I'll go with you to find out who did it. If they included me, they're asking for death!" Yao Chen's face was cold as he spoke to Xiu and Tian Luo.

Hearing Yao Chen, Luo Tian's group flying swiftly paused slightly, their hearts heavy.

Xiu and Tian Luo were now at the Epoch Peak level. Though this wasn't a major power in the Nine Domains, they were top-tier within it. With their strength, they could easily support a sect.

But both were killers—killers' strongholds were hidden, hard to find. Yet they were still destroyed. Few in the Nine Domains could do this.

"Did you find out who did it?" Luo Tian's brows furrowed, looking at Xiu and Tian Luo.

"No, it was premeditated. They took advantage of our absence to destroy the sect completely!" Xiu and Tian Luo's voices were icy.

This sect was their life's work, and now it was gone—most people would have gone mad.

"Could it be the Shura City? After all, your forces were considerable. You also had trouble with them because of Luo Tian!" Diao Dezhu spoke softly.

"No, Yan Xiu Luo and Yan Hongtao are now Provisional Epoch Lords. Our sect was hidden, but with Shura City's intelligence, finding our location wasn't hard. With their strength, they didn't need to lure us away!" Tian Luo shook his head.

"Correct. The Shura Domain is different from other domains—might is right. Shura City doesn't interfere with its people. If you could trouble them, it meant you had the strength!" Xiu's voice was hoarse.

"After I finish my task, we'll return to the Four Sacred Star Domains and help you find out who did it!" Luo Tian's face was also cold. Though he rarely contacted Xiu and Tian Luo, their bond hadn't changed. If they had problems, Luo Tian couldn't ignore it.

Time passed slowly. With their current speed, they arrived at the Fire Domain's starry void in a day, rushing toward the Endless Flame Sea.

After passing through the fire sea, Luo Tian's group finally arrived at their small world. They saw the gray Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda hovering in the starry void. A figure in white robes sat there, and when Luo Tian's group appeared, the figure stood up.

"Grandmaster!" Luo Tian's group looked puzzled at the standing Grandmaster Gu Tianshu, not seeing Ji Jiu You and Dongbo Xin.

"Back already?" Grandmaster Gu Tianshu smiled, scanning Luo Tian with satisfaction in his eyes.

"You didn't waste your trip! You've become a Provisional Epoch Lord. Even I might not be your match now. Finally, you've grown up!" Grandmaster Gu Tianshu spoke softly.

"Grandmaster, where are Master Ji and Master Dongbo?" Luo Tian respectfully asked but was still worried about Fu Xingyue's safety.

"Luotian!" As Luo Tian's words finished, a surprised voice echoed from the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda. Fu Xingyue, holding a small Qiankun Shenghun Tree, stepped out of the pagoda.

"Xing... Xingyue..." Luo Tian's body froze, staring at Fu Xingyue with disbelief, even rubbing his eyes.

Luo Tian was completely stunned—he had left Fu Xingyue as a soul about to vanish, but now she was alive and lively.

"It's all Master Ji's plan. He didn't want you to be too idle, fearing your cultivation wouldn't progress!" Grandmaster Gu Tianshu sighed, explaining.

Three months after Luo Tian's group left, Ji Jiu You, Dongbo Xin, and Grandmaster Gu Tianshu had combined their efforts to revive Fu Xingyue.

"This..." Luo Tian was speechless, not expecting his trip to the White Bone Forest had been in vain. Then his face turned angry.

"I almost died in the White Bone Forest! Master Ji was too high on me, that's the White Bone Forest!" Luo Tian's face showed bitterness. He wanted to curse but Fu Xingyue had finally come back alive.

"Luotian, you should thank Master Ji!" Fu Xingyue understood Luo Tian's thoughts and spoke, but her voice carried a hint of sorrow.

Chapter 1627: Ji Jiu You's Seat-Submersion ()

"What's wrong?" Luo Tian sensed Fu Xingyue's sorrowful tone and furrowed his brows, a bad premonition rising.

"Master Ji has lived for 8.51 million years, and by all rights, he should have reached his limit!" Grandmaster Gu Tianshu sighed softly.

"8.51 million years!" Yao Chen inhaled sharply, his eyes filled with disbelief.

"Yes, Master Ji lived to the third million years and achieved a second life, hence reaching eight million years!" Grandmaster Gu Tianshu sighed.

"But this second life has also reached its limit, so he now..." Grandmaster Gu Tianshu didn't finish his sentence. Luo Tian's group understood the implication and fell silent.

"What about Master Ji now?" Luo Tian looked at Grandmaster Gu Tianshu, his heart sinking.

"Master Ji's cultivation reached the Dao's peak. He had consumed a lot to save me, so he seated himself in submersion one month ago!" Fu Xingyue's eyes were filled with sorrow, her purple eyes misted. If it weren't for saving her, Master Ji might have lasted longer.

"What!" Hearing Fu Xingyue's words, Luo Tian's heart felt as if struck by something heavy. His body swayed slightly.

Others also showed disbelief, looking at Fu Xingyue. They were all young; to them, Ji Jiu You's strength was the most unfathomable among Grandmaster Gu Tianshu and Dongbo Xin. He had once captured many clan's peak warriors alone—such a powerhouse was supposed to be immortal, yet he had submered.

They hadn't been away for long but found him submered. A powerhouse had silently perished.

"Everyone has their end. No one is immune unless they reach the ultimate level and transcend, becoming immortal. That's why everyone strives for cultivation—to achieve immortality!" Grandmaster Gu Tianshu spoke softly, looking at Luo Tian.

"How could it be!" Luo Tian still couldn't believe it. That old blind man who had always wanted to take him as an apprentice was gone like that.

"The Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda has something Master Ji left for you. He said it was for you. Since you're back, go check!" Fu Xingyue approached Luo Tian, still hesitant as their relationship wasn't confirmed.

"Okay!" Luo Tian nodded gently. His anger was replaced with guilt.

"Go on," Grandmaster Gu Tianshu spoke softly, indicating Luo Tian to enter the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda.

"Wait here!" Luo Tian told Diao Dezhu's group and stepped into the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Pagoda.

A wave of energy spread as Luo Tian entered the pagoda for the first time, quickly reaching its top.

This place was clearly carefully arranged by Fu Xingyue—a statue of a man carrying a broken sail stood in a grand hall. Beneath the statue, a stone tablet was erected with just a few characters: "Ji Jiu You's Tomb." No records of Ji Jiu You's life. Others might think it was just a regular tomb, not realizing it was the grave of an immortal who had achieved a second life.

"Master!" Luo Tian stood before the statue, then knelt on the ground with solemnity.

"I have never kneeled to heaven or earth, only my parents and master. But today, Master's deeds for me deserve this knee!" Luo Tian bowed respectfully to Ji Jiu You's statue.

The humming echoed, waves of energy radiated from the statue, then light condensed before Luo Tian.

"Back already!" An old voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears. A white light condensed into Ji Jiu You's figure, appearing before Luo Tian.

"Master!" Luo Tian looked at the light, knowing it was Ji Jiu You's remnant, not his true body or even a soul.
