"you!" Luo Tian's spirit trembled, his eyes narrowing as he gazed upon Fu Tianqing, pinned beneath the earth with blood trickling from his lips. His gaze turned icy.

A thunderous uproar echoed as members of the Star Moon Divine Clan, their faces contorted with fury, turned their eyes toward the mighty Golden Crow perched in the heavens.

Yet Fu Wenbin remained oblivious, his gaze fixed upon Luo Tian: "Eat it. Once you do, everything will be over!"

"Rest assured, the Curse God Pill bears no adverse effects. As long as you do not slay a royal clan member, you shall remain unharmed. But should you kill even a single transcendent-level royal, you will fall under the curse's grasp—its strength merely depends on your victim's might. The stronger the royal you kill, the fiercer the curse shall be," Old Sa Man spoke softly, explaining to Luo Tian.

"I'll eat it!" Luo Tian nodded, swallowing the gray Curse God Pill with a flick of his hand.

Luo Tian had no choice; he was at their mercy. His gaze locked with the Golden Crow's, his voice resolute: "One day, I shall reclaim my master's slap!"

"Hah! I welcome you anytime. But you'll have to wait a few million years!" The Golden Crow laughed heartily, his gaze filled with disdain as he regarded Luo Tian.

The Golden Crow spoke truth. Upon entering the Epoch Realm, progress was agonizingly slow. Many spent their entire lives trapped in the early stages of the Epoch, while even prodigies often lingered for years.

"Yet I can still defeat your disciple!" Luo Tian's heart stirred with a flicker of murder, the sensation of being controlled repugnant to him.

"Zhu..." As this murderous intent flared, a wisp of gray mist coiled within Luo Tian's dantian, wrapping around his soul like a serpent.

"Damned curse!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly, suppressing the urge to kill. The gray mist dissipated in tandem with his resolve.

"Are you satisfied?" Fu Wenbin's lips curled into a smile, clearly pleased with Luo Tian's acceptance of the Curse God Pill.

"Then there's nothing more to say. From now on, he is a prodigy of the Star Moon Divine Clan," Old Sa Man spoke softly.

"But I must reclaim 'Man Qi Ta'! It is our clan's secret, not to be shared with outsiders," Old Sa Man added, his tone resolute.

"Very well. I'll grant you this favor," the Golden Crow relented, his expression softening. Though the Golden Crow was powerful, the Star Moon Divine Clan was no weakling—unlike the royal clan they had once eradicated, which lacked an Epoch Peak presence.

"But 'Man Qi Ta' has already been mastered by this boy. How can I reclaim it? Old Sa Man, grant me some courtesy. I'll compensate your clan appropriately and guarantee he won't reveal it," Fu Wenbin replied.

"Simply erase his memory! Trust me, if we remove only the memory of 'Man Qi Ta,' it won't harm him greatly. He should endure it without issue," Old Sa Man suggested.

"Impossible!" Fu Wenbin refused outright. Though erasing memory seemed harmless, he knew that stripping one's soul of completeness would hinder future cultivation—effectively dooming him from attaining the Epoch Realm. And Luo Tian's potential was undeniable; he could very well ascend to become the Star Moon Divine Clan's ruler. Fu Wenbin would never allow that.

"Old Fu, what if I asked you to hand over your Star Moon Divine Scripture? Would you?" Old Sa Man's voice carried no room for negotiation.

"No," Fu Wenbin sighed, his frustration mounting. Another problem had arisen after solving one.

"Senior, I swear an oath of blood—this secret will never leave me!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice resolute.

"Impossible! Our clan's secrets are irreplaceable!" Old Sa Man's tone hardened, his gaze piercing Luo Tian.

"Don't push me!" Luo Tian's suppressed anger flared again, his eyes burning with contempt toward Old Sa Man.

"Push you? What do you think I am?" Old Sa Man smiled coldly, his eyes filled with disdain.

"I've already yielded this far. Do you think I fear death? If I did, I wouldn't be here!" Luo Tian stepped back, his pale face contrasting with his powerful voice.

"I wouldn't have fought for Star Moon Emperor!" Luo Tian added, his tone laced with madness.

"And yet you've been pressured at every turn—first against the clan's prodigies, then by ten warriors. Now you're forced to swallow the Curse God Pill, and now they demand I erase my memory, blocking my path to enlightenment!" Luo Tian's voice carried fury.

"Great Commander!" The Star Moon Divine Clan members, witnessing Luo Tian's solitude, felt their hearts tremble.

Luo Tian spoke truth. Even if he were human, his presence within the Star Moon Divine Clan would have gone unnoticed.

"I believe in the Great Commander!" The Star Moon Guards' faces bore determination as they supported Luo Tian, recalling his deeds within the clan and among the Star Moon Guards.

"What do you mean? Think you can escape just because you're far away?" Old Sa Man's face held mockery, ignoring Luo Tian's distance.

"You are a master of the Epoch Peak, leader of the蛮族. But don't underestimate a 'louse' in your eyes. If pushed, even lice can cause you great loss! Old man, do you dare bet? See if your time to kill me is faster than my time to spread 'Man Qi Ta' across the Origin Domain!" Luo Tian's voice rang out, his eyes locked on Old Sa Man.

Chapter 1341: Have You Ever Been Moved?

"What did you say?" Old Sa Man's eyes flashed with fury, yet he held back. His gaze bore into Luo Tian.

"I said, if you press me further, I'll spread 'Man Qi Ta' across the entire Origin Domain! I know you could kill me easily, but even a mud man has three sparks of anger. And I am no ordinary man!"

"Even if I die, I'll do it! You, a master of the Epoch Peak, dare to gamble? See if your time to kill me is faster than my time to transmit this through my spirit to those in Star Moon City!" Luo Tian's voice carried a threat.

"You dare!" Old Sa Man's eyes narrowed, his voice sharp as he unleashed pressure toward Luo Tian.

"Man, with the might of invincibility, gather beneath your feet..." As Luo Tian felt the pressure, he instantly transmitted his voice into everyone's minds, including Man Hun's.

"Boom..." The Star Moon City erupted in chaos, its people staring at Luo Tian with excitement.

"Continue!" They shouted, their voices filled with exhilaration. Even the royal clan members watched Luo Tian eagerly.

Old Sa Man's face darkened, his expression as stormy as a river. He withdrew his pressure, gazing at Luo Tian—knowing he could no longer push him.

"Ah..." Luo Tian exhaled, his gaze on Sa Man. The tension in his chest finally eased.

"Kill him!" Someone shouted, their voice filled with excitement. They coveted 'Man Qi Ta,' especially after witnessing Luo Tian's devastating kick that shattered a Golden Crow.

"Enough, Old Man. Let me grant you this favor. As compensation, I'll gift your clan half of the Star Moon Divine Scripture," Fu Wenbin said, stepping in front of Luo Tian.

"Hmph..." Old Sa Man's face remained cold, his breath heavy. He had never been threatened by a boy before.

"Enough, enough. Calm down. Don't argue with a youth," Fu Wenbin quickly reassured, his smile genuine.

"Kid, you did well. I've grown fond of you," the Golden Crow chuckled, pleased to see Old Sa Man outmaneuvered.

Luo Tian exhaled deeply, scanning the Golden Crow. He cursed inwardly: "You're no better. I'll beat you one day, old fool!"

"Old Fu, I grant you this favor. Let him swear blood oaths; it's settled," Old Sa Man, unwilling to gamble, knew that killing Luo Tian would take but a moment—provided Fu Wenbin didn't interfere. If he did, Luo Tian had time to spread 'Man Qi Ta' across Star Moon City.

"Alas..." The people sighed, disappointed but resigned. There was nothing they could do.

Fu Wenbin and Old Sa Man exchanged thoughts, with Fu Wenbin handing over the upper half of the Star Moon Divine Scripture. Seeing Luo Tian's oath, Old Sa Man relented.

"We won't linger," Old Sa Man coldly said, gazing at Luo Tian before grabbing Man Hun and tearing through space, vanishing from sight.

"Old friend, I'm leaving. Visit my Golden Crow clan sometime," the Golden Crow grinned, lifting his ten disciples and vanishing.

"Everyone who wishes to stay in the Star Moon Divine Clan will be welcomed. I'll not linger," Fu Wenbin addressed them, grabbing Luo Tian and vanishing with two other attendants.

Fu Tianqing and Fu Tianbao led Fu Xingxuan, Fu Xingyang, and Fu Xingyue, disappearing from sight.

"Let's go," Qi Rongxiu said coldly to Qi Ziyang, heading toward the teleportation array.

Others, lacking a master of the Epoch Peak, chose either the teleportation array or to traverse starfields.

"Unexpectedly, Luo Tian," Tu Feiyang's eyes gleamed with admiration as he followed a blood clan master of the Epoch Late Stage, choosing to traverse space.

After a day of chaos in Star Moon City, as the ancient clans departed, it returned to calm. Yet the excitement of the Emperor's coronation remained undiminished—unparalleled in Star Moon City history.

The first female emperor, Fu Xingxuan, ascended. Then came the pressure from ancient clans to marry. Next, Star Moon Guard's Great Commander faced off against clan prodigies, defeating a Golden Crow with one step. His invincibility stunned all.

Most were shocked to learn the Great Commander was human, despite Fu Wenbin's denial. Yet people weren't blind; after time passed, eighty percent believed Luo Tian was indeed human.

"How did he become part of the Star Moon Divine Clan? Even attendants didn't notice," they murmured.

"Indeed. But after swallowing the Curse God Pill, he's bound to us," they added.

"Regardless, his battle against clan prodigies alone earns my acceptance as Star Moon Guard's Great Commander," the city's people debated, most accepting Luo Tian.

Yet some still couldn't accept. The ancient clans' hatred for humans was deeply ingrained.

Time passed, and seven days had elapsed since Fu Xingxuan's coronation. In the innermost chamber of the Emperor's Palace, Fu Wenbin and others sat, with Fu Tianbao and Fu Tianqing seated below.

Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingyang, and Fu Xingxuan stood beside them, gazing at Luo Tian, who smiled.

"Your wounds are healed?" Fu Wenbin asked softly, his voice inquiring.

"Yes," Luo Tian nodded. He was grateful for Fu Wenbin's use of half the Star Moon Divine Scripture to calm Old Sa Man, even if Fu Wenbin had his own motives.

"Good. Prepare for the wedding with Starxuan in a month," Fu Wenbin said, as if forgetting their previous conversation.

"What!" The group's surprise was palpable. Fu Xingxuan turned crimson, her gaze at Fu Wenbin but she said nothing.

"Ah..." Luo Tian was stunned by Fu Wenbin's words, yet a bitter smile formed on his face. He sighed inwardly at Fu Wenbin's effort to keep him.

"I cannot accept. I already have four wives and will not marry anyone else," Luo Tian bowed respectfully, his voice polite.

"Moreover, you once said to save me. I can choose to leave. I'll always remember your kindness. I promise, if the Star Moon Divine Clan needs me, I'll face fire and water."

"I'm not heartless. I miss my parents, my wives, my home," Luo Tian's words rang with conviction.

Hearing this, Fu Xingxuan's face paled. Her body trembled as she felt something block her heart, speechless.

The courtyard grew heavy. Their gazes turned hostile, especially Fu Tianbao and Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang's eyes filled with anger.

"Kid, don't be ungrateful. We saved you from the clan. We've lost much. Yet you still insist on leaving? What do you think of our Star Moon Divine Clan?" An elder spoke, his voice filled with anger as he unleashed pressure toward Luo Tian.

"Boom..." Luo Tian couldn't withstand the Epoch Peak master's pressure, kneeling on one knee. Cracks spread beneath his knees.

"Indeed! Luo Tian, we've treated you so well. Can't keep you?" Fu Tianbao shouted, his hand swinging toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian knelt on the ground without retaliation. He knew the Star Moon Divine Clan had done him good, so he wouldn't dodge this slap.

"Father!" A figure blocked Fu Tianbao's path—Fu Xingxuan, who stopped him.

"Xingxuan, what are you doing?" Fu Tianbao's eyes held confusion. Why did she stop him?

"I want to ask him one question," Fu Xingxuan shook her head, turning toward Luo Tian. Her eyes held tears.

"Do you like me? Or have you ever felt something for me?" Fu Xingxuan's gaze was scrutinizing.

Fu Xingxuan didn't know why. Initially, she had been curious about Fu Mengchen, wanting to tease him. Later, discovering he was the same as Xiao Ding, she grew annoyed with Luo Tian, wanting to challenge him constantly. Yet Luo Tian's excellence in strength and alchemy, his presence at the Thundering Palace, had stirred her heart. Yet she wasn't sure what it was.

Today, Luo Tian's exposure to protect her from clan prodigies made Fu Xingxuan realize she had fallen for this man she once despised.

Chapter 1342: Departure

Luo Tian gazed at Fu Xingxuan, his eyes flickering. He couldn't define his feelings for her—only that he didn't dislike her past challenges. Perhaps a little fondness, but not the kind of love.

Luo Tian sighed deeply, gazing at Fu Xingxuan. He wouldn't lie to her.

"I'm sorry," he said softly.

Hearing this, Fu Xingxuan took two steps back. Her pale face and purple eyes glistened with tears, which she quickly wiped away.

"I'm fine," Fu Xingxuan said softly, turning back to Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang.

"Luo Tian!" Fu Xingyue glared at Luo Tian, calling him by his name. Her eyes burned with anger.

"I did nothing for my sister! You dare treat her like this!" Fu Xingyue shouted, flying toward Luo Tian and slapping his face.

"Smack!" The sound echoed. Fu Xingyue's eyes changed—this was her first slap at Luo Tian, and she hadn't expected him to dodge.

Fu Xingyang also arrived, kicking Luo Tian's body. He was thrown backward, collapsing a wall.

"Damn it! My sister is not good enough for you? A human marrying the Star Moon Divine Emperor—this is your great fortune. You choose to refuse!" Fu Xingyang cursed, his feet repeatedly stomping on Luo Tian's body.

"Big brother, little brother! Enough!" Fu Xingxuan's cold voice echoed in the courtyard. Her tone carried a hint of authority, surprising Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang but stopping their actions.

"Are you sure to leave?" Fu Wenbin's gaze was calm as he addressed Luo Tian.

"Cough... a thread of blood escaped Luo Tian's lips. He slowly stood, gazing at Fu Wenbin with determination.

"Alas... go then. If so, I'll honor my promise and not trouble you. But from now on, if you fall into our hands again, it won't be so simple," Fu Wenbin shook his head, his eyes cold.

"Yes!" Luo Tian bowed respectfully, walking out of the courtyard step by step.

Watching Luo Tian leave, two attendants looked puzzled: "Old man, let this kid go?"

"Go. If he stays, I can't keep him," Fu Wenbin smiled.

"This kid staying would mean he's heartless!" Fu Wenbin sighed, his gaze complex.

"He resisted the Star Moon Divine Clan's temptation and chose to return to humanity. That shows he's not heartless. Even if he becomes a peak master, he won't forget our clan's kindness," Fu Wenbin explained to the others.

"But leaving won't be simple either," Fu Wenbin said softly, gazing into the distance as if seeing Luo Tian's journey through endless stars.

"Enough. Don't bother with this kid anymore," Fu Wenbin ordered, signaling them to leave.

"Yes!" Fu Tianqing and others bowed respectfully, bidding farewell to Fu Wenbin before heading to their quarters.

Luo Tian walked on, seeing Star Moon Divine Clan members gazing at him with reverence. He smiled inwardly.

Soon, Luo Tian returned to Star Moon Pavilion, gazing at its familiar structures. He felt a pang of sadness. He reached his quarters where attendants stood respectfully, ready to obey his commands—though he hadn't given any in over two years.

"Summon everyone. I have something to say," Luo Tian smiled, addressing the head attendant.

"Yes!" The attendant was startled but quickly left. They had heard of Luo Tian's story and now revered him more.

Soon, a hundred attendants and hundreds of guards gathered outside his room, their faces respectful. This was the first time they had been summoned since he lived there.

"Click..." The door opened, and Luo Tian stepped out. He surveyed the five hundred people.

"I've lived here for a long time. Thank you all for your care. I've decided to reward you," Luo Tian said softly, his hand waving as arrays flew from it, enveloping the courtyard.

Though he wasn't skilled in array formations, he could create a simple one to gather energy.

These attendants and guards were at most Transcendent Realm. This array would help them train faster.

"Also, these energy stones—take and distribute them," Luo Tian smiled, handing half his energy stones to the group.

"Thank you, Great Commander!" The attendants and guards were excited, kneeling before Luo Tian with joy. With these resources, their strength would rise significantly.

How to distribute them was handled by others; Luo Tian didn't need to worry. Under their respectful gazes, he walked out of his quarters toward the military field.

The Star Moon Guards erupted in chaos as Luo Tian arrived. Their faces bore reverence, gazing at the man standing there.

"Respect the Great Commander!" The Star Moon Guards bowed in unison, their voices echoing to the heavens.

"Brothers, I may have to leave for a while. Don't slacken during my absence. All matters must follow the deputy commander," Luo Tian's gaze swept over each upright Star Moon Guard, his voice resolute.

"Boom..." Hearing this, the Star Moon Guards erupted in discussion.

"Great Commander, where are you going?" Fu Zhiming asked, his gaze on Luo Tian, concern in his voice. He thought something was wrong with the Star Moon Divine Clan.

"Nothing serious. Just to clear my mind. Don't worry," Luo Tian patted Fu Zhiming's shoulder.

"However, I hope you remember what I said. When faced with problems, don't back down. If anything happens, I'll protect you. If I can't, then the second prince will. If he can't, then the Emperor. You are Star Moon Guards, the symbol of the entire Star Moon Divine Clan," Luo Tian spoke loudly. His hands moved, and a golden mountain flew from his grasp.

"Boom..." The sound of thunder echoed in the military field as the golden mountain landed on the ground.

"This is a gift for you. You can study some martial arts within it—excellent techniques. As to how, follow the deputy commander," Luo Tian smiled at Fu Zhiming.

"Did I get a gift too?" As Luo Tian's words ended, Fu Xingyue appeared from the sky, smiling as she addressed Luo Tian.

"Respect the Second Prince!" The Star Moon Guards bowed respectfully, gazing at Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue on the platform.

Luo Tian bowed slightly but was stopped by Fu Xingyue, who spoke softly: "Go. Let's talk at my place."

"Okay!" Luo Tian smiled, following Fu Xingyue as the Star Moon Guards watched with respect.

"How does it feel, Great Commander? Something's off," the Star Moon Guards whispered after they left.

"Enough. Don't think too much," Fu Zhiming scolded, then gazed at the golden mountain with anticipation.

After a brief meditation, Fu Zhiming's face changed abruptly. His eyes were filled with excitement.

...

"Have a drink?" Fu Xingyue's handsome face bore calm as he addressed Luo Tian.

"Good!" Luo Tian didn't refuse, lifting his cup and clinking it with Fu Xingyue.

"When do you plan to leave?" Fu Xingyue sighed, gazing at Luo Tian.

"As soon as we finish this drink," Luo Tian said softly, drinking the cup and standing up.

"So urgent!" Fu Xingyue was startled but shook his head, tossing a token into Luo Tian's hand.

"Star Moon Token?" Luo Tian's eyes showed confusion, gazing at Fu Xingyue. He had returned the token to Fu Xingyue after leaving the Thundering Palace.

"Keep it. It was always yours. Also, someone might be after you. This token may help protect your identity. It's a Star Moon Divine Clan envoy token, allowing you to visit any clan," Fu Xingyue said, tossing another jade tablet into Luo Tian's hand. He knew Luo Tian could change his appearance.

"Someone after me?" Luo Tian frowned, taking the token without hesitation. After all, he had already owed too much to the Star Moon Divine Clan.

"Alright, go. Don't take the teleportation array. Remember the last lesson!" Fu Xingyue sighed, waving goodbye.

"I'll go then," Luo Tian took out a jade slip, carefully handing it to Fu Xingyue. The slip contained the complete轮回 Tian Gong (Reincarnation Heaven Art).

Before Fu Xingyue could speak, Luo Tian stepped out of his door and vanished from Fu Xingyue's sight.

"Come out. He left!" Fu Xingyue called softly, and Fu Xingxuan's figure appeared behind him.

"Forgive me. Goodbye! Star Moon Divine Clan!" Luo Tian stepped out of the city's gate, took flight, and gazed at Star Moon City one last time before soaring into the stars toward the domain's outskirts.

Chapter 1343: The Intercept by Ancient Clan

In the starry expanse of Origin Domain, on Star Moon Divine Clan's land, a flash of light appeared. Luo Tian transformed into an old man, appearing in Origin Domain's starfield.

This was his first time in Origin Domain's starfield. As soon as he arrived, he felt the immense pressure. If not for his Epoch Early Stage status, he would have been crushed back to Star Moon Continent by the powerful rules and seals.

"Master of Intercepting Heaven's methods is truly extraordinary. Even the Dao has been affected!" Luo Tian mused.

"Fu Xingyue said someone would attack me. Which clan is it?" Luo Tian pondered, gazing at the endless stars. He felt an invisible pull guiding him.

Yet after sensing that his appearance and aura differed from those they sought, the invisible pull dissipated.

"Indeed, the Thousand Faces Mask is effective. If I left as Fu Mengchen, I might have been killed upon arrival!" Luo Tian mused. His form shifted into a white light, heading toward the蛮族's continent.

"A suspicious Epoch Early Stage. Not Fu Mengchen!" A voice echoed in the void, and the stars fell silent.

Time passed. On the second day after Luo Tian's departure, news spread in Star Moon City. The Emperor issued a statement that the Great Commander was on a secret mission, but those with status knew it was merely to calm the Star Moon Guards and city dwellers. As for Fu Mengchen's whereabouts, some might have guessed.

"Hmph. He finally left," Fu Yunpeng's face bore cruelty, his eyes dark. His hands moved, and a jade slip was crushed in his grasp. An invisible wave surged out of Star Moon City toward the starfields.

"Fu Mengchen left one day ago?" When the wave reached the starfields, murmurs arose.

"Since yesterday, no teleportation waves have occurred. The entire Star Moon Continent only had one Epoch Early Stage leave," they murmured.

"He's the one. He changed his appearance! That old man is Fu Mengchen!" Waves spread, heading toward the distance.

Yet as these voices echoed, an old man emerged from Star Moon Continent, his eyes smiling. His aura radiated an invisible might.

"He is my disciple. As a master, I can only do this for him," Fu Tianqing sighed softly, appearing beyond the starfields.

"Leave them all!" Fu Tianqing's hand extended. A green palm formed, slamming toward the direction of the wave.

The void cracked. Six figures emerged from the void, their faces obscured by mist, preventing Fu Tianqing from seeing their true forms.

Yet upon seeing the six figures, Fu Tianqing's aged eyes narrowed. His gaze bore an intimidating light.

"Three Epoch Late Stages, three Epoch Mid Stages. You truly respect my disciple!" Fu Tianqing spoke softly, his voice cold.

"Fu Tianqing. You wish to protect him?" A deep voice echoed from a cloaked figure.

"Yes!" Fu Tianqing spoke, his hand summoning a Star Moon Divine Spear. It shimmered with light, surpassing the one Fu Xingyue had used. Clearly, it was beyond a pseudo-Epoch Treasure and had the potential to evolve into an actual Epoch Treasure.

"Fu Tianqing, though your cultivation is slightly higher than ours, we are three. Can you stop us? Return. Don't lose your life over one human!" Golden light flashed, a deep voice echoed.

"He is my disciple!" Fu Tianqing said nothing. His gaze locked on the six, his voice resolute.

"Then we'll take our leave!"

"You three, go after that kid!" Three Epoch Late Stages ordered their clan's Mid Stage warriors.

"Yes!" The three Mid Stages bowed, transforming into three streaks of light, chasing after Luo Tian's direction.

"Return!" Fu Tianqing sneered. He couldn't let three go. His form shifted, chasing the three Mid Stages.

"Your opponent is us!" But as Fu Tianqing moved, a figure blocked his path.

"Leave. This is beyond the Star Moon Continent. You dare attack me?" Fu Tianqing waved his Star Moon Divine Spear, unleashing a storm of power toward the three.

"Three Epoch Peak masters. They didn't protect him, so they don't care about his life. We'll just injure you," the three said without concern, their hands flashing with light as they unleashed powerful martial arts toward Fu Tianqing.

"Seems I haven't fought in a while. You, recent Epoch Late Stages, don't respect me," Fu Tianqing spoke loudly, his hunched body unleashing infinite power. He charged toward the three with his Star Moon Divine Spear.

"How could we not respect you? Otherwise, we wouldn't have stayed here!" The three figures moved swiftly, their attacks colliding with Fu Tianqing.

Thunderous explosions echoed in the starfield. The stars were annihilated by their collisions.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian didn't slacken. His two Reincarnation Immortal Bodies surged with power, his speed reaching its peak. He moved like a ghost through the void, heading toward the蛮族's continent.

After seven days of flight, Luo Tian finally saw the vast land radiating a wild aura. His heart sighed in relief.

"Finally!" Luo Tian took a deep breath, then his body turned abruptly. He vanished from the spot.

At that moment, a black ripple passed by Luo Tian before disappearing.

"Good reflexes!" A soft laugh echoed in the starfield. Two figures appeared in Luo Tian's vision.

"Is it you?" Luo Tian gazed at the two young figures, his eyes filled with disdain. He chuckled.

The first was a man in black robes—Qi Ziyang, the麒麟 clan's prodigy who had lost to Luo Tian in the Star Moon Divine Clan. The second was a young man Luo Tian hadn't fought but knew was the Hun Tian clan's prodigy, Hun Tiance.

"Only you two to intercept me?" Luo Tian's disdain deepened. His gaze locked on Qi Ziyang and Hun Tiance.

"We don't want to intercept you. But we can delay you for a while," Qi Ziyang's face bore coldness, recalling his previous defeat.
