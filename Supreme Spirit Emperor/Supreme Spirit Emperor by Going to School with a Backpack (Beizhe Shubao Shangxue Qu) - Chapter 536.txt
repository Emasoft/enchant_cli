“Foe. Always foe. Never can be friends!” Luo Tian muttered in his heart. At first, when he saw Yang Huanyu, he truly did not wish to be his enemy.

But from Yang Huanyu’s initial strike, Luo Tian knew he had been mistaken. Yang Huanyu was always his enemy—though years ago, he had aided the Tianyuan Continent, it was only because Yang Huanyu’s heart had already been broken.

“His path has not changed!” Luo Tian instantly understood Yang Huanyu’s current state.

Chapter 2054: His Path Has Never Changed

“His path has never changed!” Luo Tian gazed at Yang Huanyu, whose eyes gleamed with a sinister allure. He knew Yang Huanyu’s old obsession had never wavered.

Eternal life—Yang Huanyu had once chased it, even becoming a seal. He never expected to return after death, reborn in another form.

“Eternal life!” After his resurrection, Yang Huanyu’s resolve deepened. Having died once, he now craved eternal existence, unyielding immortality!

Thunderous clashes echoed as Luo Tian pondered. Yang Huanyu’s Mysterious Darkness War Halberd descended with overwhelming force, now reinforced by a thousand ghostly entities—equivalent to a thousand Heaven-Realm ghosts attacking Luo Tian simultaneously.

This strike was daunting even for Luo Tian, yet he still gripped his Split Sky Spear with both hands. To him, their current state was no longer enmity but rivalry.

Yang Huanyu truly was a formidable opponent, one Luo Tian respected. Yang Huanyu’s unyielding willpower was unparalleled in Luo Tian’s experience.

Tremendous震荡 (tremors) erupted above Luo Tian, shattering the icy ground. His hands trembled; even his Split Sky Spear wavered in his grasp.

“End of the game! Now it’s my turn!” Luo Tian spat blood, his chest heaving. He leapt into the air, his voice resounding with a primal chant as he swung the golden Split Sky Spear.

The clash of weapons never ceased. The Split Sky Spear, meeting its old adversary, radiated a fierce golden light, pressing downward with overwhelming might.

“Just warming up!” Yang Huanyu’s eyes blazed with battlelust, his body radiating an immense aura. His form was thick with ghostly qi, reinforced by a thousand ghosts. He swung the Mysterious Darkness War Halberd, clashing with Luo Tian’s spear.

“Crack…!” Thunder roared as the two legendary weapons, wielded by their masters with full power, collided. A deafening thunderous sound filled the air.

The ice cracked, winds howled backward, and a chilling coldness radiated from Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu’s surroundings.

“These two youths are quite intriguing,” Tianfu mused, his eyes alight with surprise as he clashed with Xue Mian. Their battle’s power was immense, and Tianfu felt their strength. Yet he welcomed the conflict—no one would dare touch the treasures now.

“Damn, Xue Mian is too tenacious! Even wounded, he still possesses such combat power!” Tianfu mused, pondering how to make Xue Mian stop.

“Xue Mian, must we fight here?”

“Don’t forget—this is the Yama King’s Palace. Someone might enter at any moment. Why not ally and eliminate others?” Tianfu mused, realizing he could not subdue Xue Mian.

“Let’s split the treasures,” Tianfu declared, addressing Xue Mian. “I know your lifespan is short. You choose first; the remaining nine are mine.”

Xue Mian’s eyes flickered, and Tianfu’s words made sense. After a moment of contemplation, Xue Mian nodded.

“I’ll count to three—let’s both exert force!” Tianfu exclaimed, his voice echoing through the hall.

“One… two… three…” The count reverberated like thunder in the chamber.

As the words faded, the cold air began to descend, and Tianfu’s axe slowed.

“Cough… cough…” At the same time, both Xue Mian and Tianfu spat blood. Their gazes met, but their eyes remained cautious.

“I’ll take the treasures,” Xue Mian said with a light laugh, his eyes turning toward Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu’s clash.

“Fine. I’ll deal with these two youths,” Tianfu declared, his voice laced with disdain.

“No!” But as Tianfu moved, Xue Mian’s voice echoed in his ear, causing all three—Tianfu, Luo Tian, and Yang Huanyu—to startle.

“These two youths are intriguing.”

“I wish to watch a bit longer; after all, this hall needs some entertainment,” Xue Mian said with a light laugh. He flew toward the Ultimate Dao Immortal Soul, pressing his hands to form seals.

“Very well,” Tianfu conceded, acknowledging Xue Mian’s demand. He had now witnessed Xue Mian’s peculiar nature; he could not risk ruining their fragile alliance over a minor issue.

Terror now gripped Tianfu—Xue Mian’s power was undeniable. Their alliance benefited them; if they fought further, others would profit.

“You dare!” Yang Huanyu roared as he saw Xue Mian about to break the Ultimate Dao Immortal Soul’s seal. His eyes darkened, pupils turning black with no white.

“Don’t be angry—staring won’t help. This thing is useless to me. Continue fighting, and whoever wins shall claim the Ultimate Dao Immortal Soul!” Xue Mian extended a finger, sending an ice blade to slice through the approaching black divine light.

“What?” Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu both froze, their gazes locking onto Xue Mian in disbelief.

“Truly…” Tianfu’s eyes were equally astonished, speechless at Xue Mian’s casual treatment of the Ultimate Dao Immortal Soul.

“Don’t doubt me—there’s no need to deceive you two,” Xue Mian said, breaking the seal and seizing the Ultimate Dao Immortal Soul. He assessed it with confidence.

Xue Mian believed Luo Tian would win, and for now, he needed to continue the charade to keep Luo Tian hidden.

“I’ll trust you once—those who deceive me never end well, no matter their identity or power. Even an Ultimate Dao Immortal Soul’s peak would pay the price!” Yang Huanyu coldly replied, raising his Mysterious Darkness War Halberd to strike Luo Tian again.

“Crazy!” Luo Tian could only sigh at Xue Mian and Yang Huanyu’s antics. Yet he had no time to ponder, as his golden Split Sky Spear became a storm sweeping toward Yang Huanyu.

“Once foes, now again—this world is truly intriguing. His return after death was unexpected,” Xue Mian mused, diverting a fraction of his attention to the battlefield before returning to the black flower radiating immortality.

Two storms clashed endlessly—golden and black—as Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu fought under Tianfu’s astonished gaze.

Luo Tian was at the Heaven-Realm peak, the strongest among Heaven-Realm cultivators. Yang Huanyu was but a step away from becoming an Ultimate Dao Immortal, their power nearly equal. Their clashes shook the hall.

“Ten Thousand Ghosts!” Yang Huanyu roared, his Mysterious Darkness War Halberd expanding dramatically. A torrent of ghostly qi filled the hall, manifesting as countless ghosts within the halberd.

A thousand Heaven-Realm ghostly entities reinforced the Mysterious Darkness War Halberd, its weight pressing down with overwhelming pressure. Even Tianfu was stunned by the force.

“Who is this man? Why has our Bountiful Heaven City no record of him?”

“He could become a major threat to Bountiful Heaven City if he continues growing,” Tianfu’s eyes flashed with killing intent. He now viewed Yang Huanyu as a target.

Yet Tianfu did not act; he was unsure of Xue Mian’s intentions, allowing the two to fight.

“Eight Methods of Shocking Immortals!” Luo Tian waved his hand, and six golden characters descended. They did not suppress Yang Huanyu but instead turned against Luo Tian himself.

“Buzz…” The six golden characters shrank upon nearing Luo Tian, transforming into the Six Character Mantra. They imprinted onto his head, limbs, and dantian, their divine laws coursing through his body.

After this, Luo Tian did not relax but gripped the Split Sky Spear, clashing with Yang Huanyu’s halberd.

Two blurs flashed—converging into one strike. Two times his physical strength, combined with the Six Character Mantra’s blessing, made Luo Tian seem like a celestial being. He clashed head-on with the Mysterious Darkness War Halberd.

Both bodies recoiled, a thousand ghosts howling in pain as their totems twisted. Yang Huanyu spat blood, his eyes glowing with divine light.

Crack… Crack… Crack…

The Six Character Mantra on Luo Tian’s body also shattered, its divine laws dispersing into his form.

“Kingdom-Subduing Battle Technique!” Luo Tian reversed, activating the technique. His body moved with his spear like a meteor streaking toward Yang Huanyu.

“Ghost Army!” Yang Huanyu clenched his fists, planting the Mysterious Darkness War Halberd into the ground. He pressed his hands to the earth, and a cascade of black divine seals spread outward.

“Borrowing the Path!” Yang Huanyu’s cold voice echoed through the hall, causing Tianfu to frown. Xue Mian, who had already retrieved the black flower with immortality’s essence, narrowed his eyes. His ice blade behind his back exhaled faint mist.

“Boom…” A deep sound echoed beneath the earth, a colossal battle spirit filling the hall instantly.

A black figure emerged from the ground—its body clad in tattered armor, headless yet gripping a rusted spear. Though decayed, its presence made Luo Tian’s eyes narrow with caution.

“Who is he in Hell?” Tianfu’s killing intent deepened; he knew only those of high rank in Hell could command ghost armies.

Chapter 2055: Borrowing the Ghost Army

Legends say Hell is a vast prison, housing the most wicked. Even those who die may suffer punishment if their sins are great.

The guardians of the Eighteen Hells are the ghost armies—neither fully ghosts nor humans, their power immense. They were forged by the Ten Kings of Yama at great cost and obey only the Ten Kings’ commands.

Now, Yang Huanyu could command them—evidently a high-ranking figure in Hell with ties to the Ten Kings.

“This youth must be captured—perhaps he’s a big fish!” Tianfu’s eyes gleamed with resolve.

“But Xue Mian is problematic. If I act independently, it might anger him. Our alliance was hard-earned; we can’t lose it now.”

“So let Luo Tian win. Then I’ll act, seizing this Hell youth.” Tianfu’s mind raced with strategies to aid Luo Tian.

Thunderous sounds echoed as ghost armies emerged from the black seals, standing in formation with a divine aura.

“One Ultimate Dao Immortal, nine early-stage ones—plus me. How will you resist?” Yang Huanyu smiled, confident of victory.

“You still enjoy meddling with corpses!” Luo Tian shook his head, as if greeting an old friend.

“Don’t care what it is—victory is all that matters! Who opposes me, I’ll kill them! Give me the Ultimate Dao Immortal Soul, and I’ll stop!” Yang Huanyu declared.

“Impossible!” Luo Tian refused; the Ultimate Dao Immortal Soul was vital to him.

As he dashed, spear shadows surrounded him. He plunged into the ten ghost armies.

“Squeak… squeak…” The ghosts raised their weapons, attacking Luo Tian from ten directions.

“Buzz…” A spearstorm formed, Luo Tian at its center, swirling outward.

Clashes echoed as golden spear shadows met the ghosts’ weapons. Sparks flew from the storm.

“Truly impressive, Luo Tian—ten ghost armies can’t subdue you!” Yang Huanyu watched from outside the storm, admiration in his eyes.

“This youth truly is the fastest rising captain. He has skill!” Tianfu marveled, watching Luo Tian wield his Split Sky Spear.

Tianfu had seen countless half-Immortals, but this was the first time he witnessed such a formidable one.

“Your turn!” As Tianfu praised, a cold voice echoed in his ear, snapping him back to reality. His eyes flared with excitement.

“Understood!” Tianfu nodded, rushing toward the nine remaining treasures. The ones he had already claimed were real.

Xue Mian stood with a smile, observing Luo Tian and Yang Huanyu’s battle.

“If you defeat this foe, you’ll be qualified—fusing the Ultimate Dao Immortal Soul will transform your strength entirely!” Xue Mian mused, his eyes alight with anticipation.

No matter what, Xue Mian would gift the Ultimate Dao Immortal Soul to Luo Tian. He had already decided: if Luo Tian won, he would reveal his true face; if not, he’d continue hiding until Luo Tian grew strong enough.

Luo Tian in the open, Xue Mian in the shadows—now all of Bountiful Heaven City knew their feud. This would ease Luo Tian’s future actions in the city.

“Soul Burial!” Yang Huanyu saw Luo Tian battling ten ghosts, a smile on his face. His hands moved swiftly, the Mysterious Darkness War Halberd radiating waves of ghostly qi.

“This is no good—I’m too passive. If his technique solidifies, I might lose!” Luo Tian mused.

Yet the ten ghosts attacked relentlessly, giving him no respite. One misstep and he’d face a storm of attacks.

“Ghost Sealing Seal!” Luo Tian roared, a black moon rising behind him. Ten thousand ghosts howled as the seal appeared in the hall.

“Subdue!” Luo Tian swung his spear and pressed a hand into the void, crushing two ghosts with the seal.

Though ghostly in nature, these were souls refined by the Ten Kings—possessing ghostly traits. The Ghost Sealing Seal couldn’t fully suppress them, but it disrupted their movements.

As the seal appeared, the ten ghosts hesitated—Luo Tian seized the chance to crush them.

“Boom…” The seal expanded, shattering two early-stage ghost armies. Dust swirled, a decayed scent emanating from the broken ghosts.

With two eliminated, it felt like a wound had been torn open—Luo Tian broke free.

“Indeed effective!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed, driving the Ghost Sealing Seal forward while his Split Sky Spear created残影 (residual images). The remaining eight ghosts were all slain, their bones and flesh exuding black qi but no blood—eerie.

“Only one remains!” Luo Tian roared, drawing the震仙笔 (Shocking Immortal Brush). Six characters surged toward the last ghost army.

Though the ghost’s strength seemed formidable, it was still weaker than a true Immortal. The Eight Methods of Shocking Immortals struck with overwhelming power, crushing the mid-stage ghost army.

“Boom…” The giant body was shattered by the six characters, and Luo Tian received a slash to his abdomen, leaving a bloodstain.

“No use!” As Luo Tian caught his breath, Yang Huanyu’s voice echoed in his ear. A black cloud descended over Luo Tian’s head.

A black ancient coffin plummeted from the sky, covering Luo Tian instantly.

“Boom…” The dark coffin appeared in the hall, its lid slamming shut with a thunderous sound.

“Crash… crash…” The scattered ghost flesh rapidly healed, reassembling into ten ghosts. Nine early-stage and one mid-stage carried the coffin.

“Truly formidable!” Xue Mian’s eyes gleamed, watching Luo Tian sealed within the coffin—his aura was now undetectable.

“End of the game. Please honor your promise and give me that Ultimate Dao Immortal Soul!” Yang Huanyu smiled at Xue Mian.

“You speak too soon,” Xue Mian lightly shook his head, gazing at the nine ghosts carrying the black coffin.

“He’s destined to never emerge!”

Soul Burial was an ultimate technique from Hell, derived from Yama King’s burial methods. Though not as powerful as Burial of Heaven, it was beyond Luo Tian’s current ability to break.

“Your appearance shook me—even injuring you, you still fought back. Are you also a cultivator from the Tianyuan Continent?” Yang Huanyu’s eyes held amusement, scanning Xue Mian.

“Correct!” Xue Mian nodded. He knew his actions had raised suspicion, and he also knew Luo Tian would speculate.

But Yang Huanyu’s return was unexpected—had it not been for his deep impression years ago, he might have forgotten about him.

“I don’t care who you are. Since you were once a cultivator of the Tianyuan Continent, you must know my past and methods!”

“Give me that soul!” Yang Huanyu waved his hand, addressing Xue Mian—just as the Yama King who once terrorized the Tianyuan Continent.

“But you’ve forgotten—who stopped your plan?”

“And now, before me, you have no right to threaten me!” Xue Mian smiled, gazing at the black coffin.

“Ha! Brother Xue Mian, shall I help you kill this youth?” Tianfu approached with his axe, eyes unkind toward Yang Huanyu.

“The game isn’t over yet!” Xue Mian shook his head, eyes fixed on the black coffin.

“Boom… boom… boom…” A deep sound echoed within the coffin, and the nine ghosts carrying it began to tremble. The black lid lifted slightly, emitting wisps of dark qi.

Darkness enveloped Luo Tian, his vision lost in endless ghostly qi seeking to bind and assimilate him.

Luo Tian repeatedly punched, dispersing the ghostly qi—yet it endlessly regenerated.

Chapter 2056: Doubt

“This won’t work!” Luo Tian stood in the dark space, his face grim. If he lingered too long, even he would succumb to the ghostly qi’s erosion.

He took out the Shiyi Bow, his eyes glowing with divine light as it凝聚 (concentrated)仙气 (divine energy) into a golden arrow, illuminating the dark space.

He shot the arrow, following it with flight.

The golden arrow acted as a beacon, guiding Luo Tian through the swirling dark qi. Each black ghostly qi was annihilated by the arrow.

After what felt like an eternity, the golden arrow exploded before Luo Tian, releasing a surge of divine energy.

Luo Tian hadn’t reacted in time and collided with it, a deep sound echoing as he felt like hitting a mountain. His head spun, his face pale.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian cursed internally, stars flashing before his eyes. He steadied himself, gradually regaining clarity.

“Breaking this must let me out!” Luo Tian mused, then punched forward—shattering the ghostly qi approaching him. He also struck the invisible barrier.

“Boom…” Next moment, Luo Tian was violently thrown back, his face pale and eyes wide with shock.

“Boom… boom…” At the same time, the black coffin’s lid trembled violently. The ghost carrying it let out low growls.

“You’re still as annoying as ever!” Yang Huanyu smiled, his hands forming seals. Black characters flew from his palms.

“Roar…” The ten ghosts howled, spewing black snakes from their mouths—wrapping around the black coffin.

“Luo Tian, wait patiently for your assimilation!” Yang Huanyu smiled, his voice echoing in the dark space.

“Dream on!” Luo Tian roared, unleashing two times his physical strength. His divine energy converged into a fist, striking with maximum power.

“Boom…” The thunderous impact sent Luo Tian flying back, but his bloodied mouth showed glimmers of light—confirming his guess was correct.

“I’ll have to kill you then!” Yang Huanyu’s face darkened, his killing intent surrounding him. He pointed a finger, sending a black blade into the coffin.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian felt an immense life-threatening danger. Almost instantly, he tilted his head—his cheek bore a bloodstain as a black qi severed several strands of hair, vanishing into the endless darkness.

“He can still attack here from outside!” Luo Tian was astonished; he was now blind, unable to see his surroundings. His previous evasion had been luck.

“Indeed impressive—evading one! What about ten? A hundred?” Yang Huanyu spoke softly, gazing at Xue Mian. His hands moved, and a hundred black blades hovered around him.

“This…” Tianfu saw the hundreds of blades and the coffin, his eyes widening. Though large, if a hundred blades struck, Luo Tian would be pierced like a hedgehog or torn to shreds.

Xue Mian’s eyes flickered, uncertainty creeping in. He wanted Luo Tian to grow stronger in adversity but not at the cost of his life.

“Indeed!” Yang Huanyu’s lips curled, his hands clapping—hundred blades instantly flew toward the black coffin.

“Buzz…” Just as they neared, a cold aura swept over them, instantly freezing the black blades.

“Crash… crash…” Icicles fell to the ground, Tianfu’s eyes widening in surprise.

“You don’t want him dead—give me the Ultimate Dao Immortal Soul!” Yang Huanyu smiled, leaping to the coffin’s side.

“You’re threatening me?” Xue Mian’s cold voice echoed, but his eyes admired Yang Huanyu. He now understood that Yang Huanyu had likely known from the start their relationship was complex.

Thus, he had planned ahead—this move was a test of Xue Mian’s resolve.

Xue Mian dared not gamble; though confident in Luo Tian, Yang Huanyu was the only one who had inflicted significant damage on him.

“It’s not a threat—just reclaiming what is mine!”

“Please honor your promise. I only want the Ultimate Dao Immortal Soul!” Yang Huanyu smiled, addressing Xue Mian.

Their exchange left Tianfu bewildered, but Luo Tian in the black coffin couldn’t hear their words.

“If I don’t?” Xue Mian spoke gravely, white mist rising from his body. The ground began to freeze again.

“Then he dies!” Yang Huanyu waved his hand, two blades piercing the black coffin. The spreading ice halted.

“I fear you won’t live to enjoy it!” Xue Mian smiled, pointing his finger—The Ultimate Dao Immortal Soul’s vial appeared in his hand.

“It’s none of your concern!”

“I don’t like words—take the soul or let him live. You have one choice!” Yang Huanyu’s brows furrowed, his aura sharpening.

“Take it!” Xue Mian waved his hand, the vial flying toward Yang Huanyu.

Yang Huanyu grabbed it, his eyes gleaming with joy. He licked his lips—fusing this soul would make him an Ultimate Dao Immortal. With his strength, he’d gain a massive power boost.

“Boom…” But just as Yang Huanyu reached for the vial, a deafening explosion echoed behind him.

The sudden blast startled Tianfu; it was too abrupt.

“Puke…” Yang Huanyu spat blood, his face filled with shock as he turned.

Eight-colored flames surged outward, filling the hall. The terrifying heat made Tianfu and Xue Mian’s faces change.

“Seems you haven’t won yet!” Xue Mian smiled, the vial reversing and returning to his hand.

The black coffin and ten ghosts vanished, replaced by the eight-colored flames. Luo Tian stepped out, instantly appearing beside Yang Huanyu, three fist shadows before him.

“Triple Physical Strength!” Luo Tian roared, his punch striking with the power of heaven and earth. Waves radiated around his fist.

“Ten Thousand Ghosts!” Yang Huanyu roared, retrieving his Mysterious Darkness War Halberd. It hummed as it struck Luo Tian.

“Crazy!” Tianfu, seeing both men show no intent to stop each other, was stunned.

“This is a final clash!” Xue Mian’s eyes gleamed with excitement, his hands tense.

“Boom…”

“Boom…” In an instant, Luo Tian’s fist struck Xue Mian’s body. Xue Mian’s Mysterious Darkness War Halberd collided with Luo Tian’s chest.

“Puke…” Both spat blood, their bodies recoiling and flying backward—life forces plummeting.

Luo Tian’s chest caved in, his eyes weak and exhausted. He slammed into the hall’s wall, shaking it violently—seeming embedded within it.

Yang Huanyu fared no better; he closed his eyes, sliding down from the hall. Blood flowed from his wounds.

“I’ve won!” Luo Tian slowly stood, gazing at Yang Huanyu’s blood-spitting form. His eyes turned to Xue Mian.

Luo Tian was in dire condition; Yang Huanyu had been too strong. If not for Xiao Qi’s breakthrough and his mastery of the second layer of the Wild Hammer Technique, yielding triple physical strength, this battle’s outcome might have been uncertain.

Luo Tian wanted to collapse but dared not—Xue Mian was still a threat, the one he feared most.

“Alright, this Ultimate Dao Immortal Soul is yours!” Xue Mian smiled, waving his hand and carelessly tossing the vial to Luo Tian.

“What?” Luo Tian was astonished—truly stunned. He remembered their feud.

This was the second Ultimate Dao Immortal Soul he’d obtained from his brothers. If not for their rift, he would have loudly thanked him.

“Something’s off!”

“Who are you?” Luo Tian suddenly realized, recalling seeing Yang Huanyu and Xue Mian’s shock after being struck by Tianfu.

“He knows Yang Huanyu—definitely! Those who know Yang Huanyu are surely from the Tianyuan Continent. No one from the Nine Domains would recognize Yang Huanyu!”

“Coldness, lightning, darkness!” Luo Tian whispered, his mind forming an answer. His eyes widened in disbelief.

“Kill this Hell youth!” As Luo Tian gained clarity, Tianfu roared, swinging his axe toward Yang Huanyu.

Chapter 2057: Misfortune
