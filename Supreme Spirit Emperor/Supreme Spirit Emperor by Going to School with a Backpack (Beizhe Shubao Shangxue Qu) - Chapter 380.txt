“Ah…” However, when Luotian’s Daoic power swept over the gray blood, a gray soul quickly emerged, gazing at Luotian with an expression of disbelief.

“What method did Qiu Tianchi employ? How could he weaken the second form of the Soul-Cutting Blade to such an extent!”

“Slaying Lu Feizhou, the second-ranked prodigy of the Sky-Soaring Rankings, and with the strength of a late-stage Sage—henceforth, Qiu Tianchi’s name shall surely be renowned across the Sky-Soaring Continent!” The crowd murmured, their gazes toward Luotian now altered.

“Soul-Cutting Blade’s Third Form: A Single Strike to Annihilate All Souls!” Yet, as Lu Feizhou transformed into a soul state, his eyes flared with madness. The gray soul waved its hands, and a streak of gray blade energy flickered above his head.

“Soul-energy-formed longsword!” The onlookers gasped, watching Lu Feizhou’s unyielding resolve, their faces marked with admiration.

“Third strike—enough to obliterate Qiu Tianchi’s soul, for this is a blade specifically crafted to sever souls. None could evade it,” Shizhen mused, his face etched with awe. He knew the third form’s terror; he had once fallen to it, securing his third place.

“Indeed…” Luotian smiled within himself, his gray soul emerging from his body as a small figure. He spat out a gray soul-sword, which flew toward the streak of gray blade energy.

“Boom…” As the gray soul-sword erupted from his mouth, it instantly expanded in size. A furious gust swept outward, and an overwhelming aura radiated from the sword.

If the ultimate cultivation realm was an Epoch Master, then a Soul-Subduing Master stood as a being akin to an Epoch Master—perhaps even greater, for no soul could withstand the pressure of a Soul-Subduing Master.

“Buzz…” The streak of gray blade energy trembled again, causing Lu Feizhou’s face to contort in shock.

At this moment, Lu Feizhou’s soul quaked; he felt the aura of annihilation within that gray sword. Before it, he was but a humble ant—any contact would mean instant destruction.

“Soul! I fear no soul!” Luotian returned to his normal state, his gaze mocking Lu Feizhou’s soul.

“Pf!” Under the crowd’s astonished gazes, the gray sword pierced through the streak of blade energy and descended upon Lu Feizhou’s head.

“Now, with but a thought, you shall perish!” Luotian spoke softly, his gaze laced with mockery.

“Rumors…” The murmurs returned, the crowd’s eyes wide with disbelief as they gazed at Luotian standing there and Lu Feizhou in his gray soul state.

“How could it be! Lu Feizhou has lost! My heavens!” The crowd gasped, even Shizhen’s face paled. He had not expected the formidable Lu Feizhou to fall at the hands of an obscure Qiu Tianchi.

“Buzz…” As Luotian pondered how to deal with Lu Feizhou, a series of buzzing sounds echoed through the void. A venerable elder tore open space and appeared before them.

“Respect the Leader!” The reverent voice echoed through heaven and earth, all faces alight with fervor as they gazed at the elder standing in the sky.

“Approximate Epoch Master!” Luotian’s spirit trembled, sensing this elder’s terrifying might.

The elder indeed possessed the cultivation of an Approximate Epoch Master, and was one of the three Approximate Epoch Masters of the Sky-Soaring Continent.

“Qiu Tianchi, for defeating Lu Feizhou, this shall be rewarded. From now on, your resources will triple, and you shall receive the Falling Star Sword and the Thousand-Image Mask,” the elder spoke softly, his gaze filled with admiration as he addressed the crowd.

“Did I hear correctly? This leader is Lu Feizhou’s master! When a disciple suffers such humiliation, he still grants rewards!” All minds shuddered, their gazes turning to admiration toward the elder in the sky—Luotian was no exception.

Luotian had encountered many masters who were titanic powers, yet when their disciples or juniors suffered harm, they would turn into another face.

“Humanity once had such a leader—how could it not flourish!” Luotian mused internally, bowing respectfully before the elder.

“Take these two treasures,” the elder smiled, nodding to Luotian. He extended his hand, retrieving Lu Feizhou from his soul state—though the latter’s face remained pale.

“Yes!” Luotian bowed, accepting the shimmering starlight sword and the blood-red mask. Only now did he learn that the Thousand-Image Mask of the Soul-Cutting Master had been gifted by Qiu Tianchi to Wang Duantian.

“Enough, all of you—Humanity has just risen; the most vital thing is talent. If any among you can reach Qiu Tianchi’s level, we shall reward accordingly!” The elder spoke again, his gaze sweeping over the crowd.

“Buzz…” Before the elder’s words had finished, Luotian’s surroundings twisted again, and he exhaled a long breath.

“Has the second trial ended?” Luotian mused internally, allowing space to twist as he awaited the next trial.

Meanwhile, others progressed at their own pace—some had passed the first stage, while others, like Luotian, had cleared their trials.

“Boom…” Yet one was an exception: Tu Feiyang and Man Hun, who were repeatedly slain and expelled from the Soul-Subduing Tower.

“Damn this thing!” Tu Feiyang slumped on the ground, gazing at the gray Qi-Subduing Tower and muttering.

“Indeed! What is this? Letting us pass or not? I’ve died over forty times!” Man Hun muttered, their misfortunes nearly identical. Neither had cleared the first trial.

“I won’t accept defeat! If there is a flaw in this test, I’ll find it!” Tu Feiyang’s face bore madness, his eyes bloodshot as he charged toward the Qi-Subduing Tower again.

“Right!” Man Hun nodded, following Tu Feiyang into the tower.

“Buzz…” The buzzing echoed again as Luotian’s surroundings clarified, yet no sign of the Soul-Cutting Master remained. From this memory, it was clear that the Soul-Cutting Master had departed Humanity, and Qiu Tianchi had gifted the Thousand-Image Mask to Wang Duantian.

The third trial required leading a Human prodigy to repel the attacks of the Ancient Clans. After all, the Ancient Clans would never allow Humanity to flourish and thus sought to exterminate them.

Luotian led his forces, slaying nearly ten thousand Ancient Clans’ peers to complete the trial. He received a commendable technique, though it was of little use for Luotian at the late-stage Epoch level.

In the following period, Luotian continuously passed the trials of the Qi-Subduing Tower—slaying Ancient Clans’ prodigies or leading Humanity to repel assaults.

At the same time, Luotian experienced another life as Qiu Tianchi, witnessing his formidable strength.

However, from the third trial onward, Luotian never saw the Soul-Cutting Master again—vanished as if from the world.

Qiu Tianchi’s strength, whether among Humanity or the Ancient Clans, was legendary—seeming invincible.

Of course, with each trial completed, Luotian also received benefits—be it martial arts or techniques, all once Qiu Tianchi’s secret teachings.

“Transmission—this is an indirect acceptance of transmission!” Luotian now understood the purpose of these trials.

“I wonder how others are faring,” Luotian mused, punching down a late-stage Epoch Master of the Ancient Clans. He gazed at the familiar distortion in space around him.

“Eighth trial?” Luotian murmured, a smile on his face. At this moment, Qiu Tianchi’s physical body had reached the late-stage Epoch level; if more trials remained, his cultivation might ascend to Approximate King.

“If I truly sense the strength of an Approximate King, it would be a great boon for me!” Luotian mused softly, watching space stabilize.

“This…” As space stabilized, Luotian’s face was stunned with joy.

Chapter 1513: Approximate King Approaches

Beneath the vast cosmos, Luotian stood as Qiu Tianchi, his eyes alight with joy. He gazed at the stars, feeling like a true giant, surveying heaven and earth.

“Approximate Epoch Master’s cultivation!” Luotian’s spirit roared, feeling he could pluck stars and moon. A unprecedented power filled his mind, filling him with exhilaration.

To anticipate the strength of an Approximate Epoch Master was a rare opportunity for cultivators—even Approximate Epoch Masters could not achieve this.

“Magnificent Soul-Cutting Master! Even the Epoch Treasures are so astonishing!” Luotian mused softly, then wandered aimlessly beneath the stars. After all, as an Approximate Epoch Master, he had no fear of others—Luotian even longed for someone to challenge him now.

“Glory of the Age!” Luotian continued walking, digesting Qiu Tianchi’s memories.

As time passed, battles raged until the end of this glorious age. Though Humanity had produced four or five Approximate Kings, so too had the Ancient Clans—this did not include the Ancient Clan Kings, who were at their zenith and cared little for Humanity.

“Approximate Epoch Masters and Approximate Kings are so numerous!” Luotian mused, flying toward the Sky-Soaring Continent with contemplation.

“Let this trial appear soon—once completed, it shall be the ninth!” Luotian was overjoyed. He felt he was the fastest among them, and if so, his chance of obtaining the Qi-Subduing Tower would be much greater.

“Humanity’s Approximate Epoch Master, Qiu Tianchi?” As Luotian flew, a cold voice echoed from the void. A middle-aged man clad in violet lightning emerged from space, his gaze filled with scrutiny.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed as the man’s words had barely finished, three streaks of violet lightning shot from space. Luotian furrowed his brows.

With the initial man, four figures now surrounded him, sealing space and trapping all escape routes. Even with his current state, Luotian could not break free.

“Are they Ancient Clan Kings?” Luotian furrowed his brows, gazing at the four. A middle-aged man, two elders, and a youth of Qiu Tianchi’s age—clearly an exceptional prodigy.

“Ancient Clan Kings, the Purple Frost Clan!” Luotian instantly recognized their origin, his face marked with confusion.

“Qiu Tianchi, finally caught you alone!” The Purple Frost Clan youth smiled, gazing at Luotian with battle intent. Lightning crackled around him, surging toward Luotian.

“Looking for me?” Luotian furrowed his brows, recalling in Qiu Tianchi’s memories that he had no prior connection with the Purple Frost Clan.

“No choice but to kill you,” the four spoke, their voices cold. “You’ve slain too many Ancient Clans over these years.”

“Then stop talking and fight!” Luotian was fearless, for this was merely an illusion. How could he submit?

“Die!” Seeing Luotian’s defiance, the four erupted in fury. The youth swung his hands, summoning a streak of violet lightning dragon that surged toward Luotian.

The other three also attacked—two elders transformed into streaks of violet light, appearing before Luotian. Their aged fists bore overwhelming might, striking toward him.

The initial middle-aged man unleashed a net of violet lightning, instantly appearing above Luotian’s head.

Each attack was an execution—each a late-stage Approximate King’s strike, their might terrifying.

“Damn!” Luotian gritted his teeth, a battle spirit igniting as he punched toward the two Approximate Kings who had closed in.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed, splitting the cosmos as gray mist spilled from space.

“Pf!” Luotian’s body was hurled back, spitting blood as his eyes showed weakness. Yet he dared not relax—violet lightning dragon and net had already reached him.

“Break the Heavens!” Luotian roared, a white blade slicing through the sky’s violet lightning net.

“Dao Sealing Demon!” White seals wrapped Luotian’s fist, combining the techniques of ‘Fangtian’ and ‘Wanfa’, clashing with the violet lightning.

The cosmos dimmed under their clash, and Luotian immediately fell behind. Though he had experience battling late-stage Approximate Kings, this body was not his own. His true strength was not an Approximate King—though he had passed through the late-stage Epoch transition in this illusion, it was too short to be his own.

Each of the four was a master with astonishing techniques, but Luotian’s were also remarkable—his survival depended on near-death escapes and constant blood.

“Hearing that Qiu Tianchi was invincible across the Sky-Soaring Continent, now it seems he’s no better!” The Purple Frost Clan youth sneered, watching Luotian cough blood under their attacks.

“If you were alone, I’d have you not recognizing your mother!” Luotian retorted, but was nearly punched through the heart by an elder.

“Damn it!” Luotian’s fury reached its peak, unleashing all his strength—space itself shattered under their battle.

“This won’t work! It’s too embarrassing!” Luotian mused, feeling his first defeat—within an illusion. This left him with a bitter taste; though the opponent was strong, he still felt reluctant.

“Formation of the World!” Luotian roared, his golden body expanding to thousands of feet. His mastery over the Formation of the World had deepened through countless battles.

“Finally, there’s some worth!” The Purple Frost Clan youth mused, sensing Luotian now as the true Qiu Tianchi.

“Boom…” The golden hand, brimming with overwhelming might, struck toward the four. An immense aura radiated from Luotian’s body.

“Kill him!” The leading middle-aged man spoke softly, his hand emitting violet mist toward Luotian.

“Don’t let anything go wrong,” the other three nodded, their hands glowing violet as powerful auras rose. The mist enveloped Luotian’s massive form.

Two streaks of violet lightning flashed in Luotian’s eyes, and he spotted the Purple Frost Clan youth. His gaze turned cold.

“Even if I die, I’ll take one down!” Luotian’s eyes turned icy. He took a golden step forward, employing the蛮族 (Barbarian Clan) technique of ‘Seven Steps of the Barbarian.’

The golden foot crushed a vast expanse of violet mist, instantly appearing above the Purple Frost Clan youth.

“Barbarian technique! How did he learn it?” The four Approximate Kings gazed at the golden foot, their faces marked with surprise.

“Don’t mind me—focus on killing him! I can withstand it!” The youth shouted to the three, then waved his hands. A violet figure emerged behind him, forming a seal toward Luotian’s golden foot.

“Boom…” The violet mist churned, clashing with the golden foot—vast waves of power swept through the mist.

Yet Luotian’s face still showed no improvement, for he knew three Approximate Kings were watching. He could not let them fight alone.

“Buzz…” As Luotian prepared his second step, a series of buzzing sounds echoed through the cosmos. A frigid aura spread into Luotian’s mind, causing his face to change drastically.

Luotian was now an Approximate Epoch Master—his body immune to cold. To feel it was unthinkable.

“Crack…” Purple frost began forming on Luotian’s body, and he realized the violet mist was abnormal.

Cold energy spread through his entire body, as if sealed—his flowing Epoch power became thickened.

“Haha! Qiu Tianchi, how does it feel in the Purple Frost? Do you feel sealed?” A wild laugh echoed through the cold mist, and Luotian searched for the source.

“Barbarian God’s Third Step Shatters Stars!” Luotian knew that under the four Approximate Kings’ combined setup, his escape chance was slim. His goal was to kill one at least—otherwise, it would be a waste of this rare Approximate King state.

Chapter 1514: Battle to the Death

The thunderous sound echoed, and within the Purple Frost mist, Luotian’s blood surged. His golden foot struck down upon the Purple Frost Clan youth with a resounding crash.

“Buzz…” The buzzing echoed as violet energy surged from the youth’s hands, forming a beast of cold mist that lunged toward Luotian’s golden foot.

“Crack…” Purple crystals formed on the golden foot, instantly freezing it.

“One human—yet he knows Barbarian techniques! I never expected this!” The youth’s voice echoed through the violet frost, and he pointed his hand.

“Boom…” As the frozen foot descended upon the youth’s head, it shattered into pieces of violet ice, scattering through space.

“Barbarian God’s Third Step Shatters Ghosts and Gods!” Luotian sighed, his third step now unleashed.

“Kid, you’re dead today!” As Luotian’s third step struck, two elders appeared before him—front and back—and attacked.

“Get out!” Luotian roared, feeling his blood and Epoch power slow. He punched toward the two elders.

“Pf!” The punches clashed, and Luotian spat blood, his body cracking as a mist of blood rose before him.

The buzzing echoed again as Luotian’s body fell toward space, a single red leaf drifting above his head.

The frost leaf was only palm-sized, but Luotian had no doubt it contained power capable of annihilating any late-stage Epoch Master.

Luotian spat blood, his eyes weak—cursing himself for this rare chance as an Approximate Epoch Master, now brutally defeated.

“Sealing Heaven’s Seal!” A golden vortex spanned the cosmos, absorbing vast celestial power into a golden seal.

The second Epoch Master of Humanity’s techniques were formidable—especially now that Luotian was an Approximate Epoch Master. The Seal of Heaven’s Power was no less powerful than the seventh step of the Barbarian Seven Steps.

In an instant, the Seal clashed with the red frost leaf—vast waves of power engulfed space. The shockwaves swept outward, striking the bodies of all involved.

“This frost power cannot be dispersed!” Luotian gazed at the violet mist, which showed no signs of breaking. His mind was filled with awe.

“Kill!” Luotian’s eyes flashed cold, and he vanished from his spot, rushing toward the youth.

“Damn it! You think me a soft target!” The youth roared, his aura rising within the violet frost. He clashed with Luotian again.

Meanwhile, the other three Approximate Kings bore cold expressions and attacked toward Luotian, their blows constantly striking his body.

“Ah…” Yet Luotian seemed unaffected, blood gushing from him with each strike.

But he was determined to target the youth, and his techniques were beyond what the Purple Frost Clan youth could withstand.

Logically, Luotian’s strength was the weakest among Approximate Epoch Masters and Approximate Kings. Yet his techniques were so astonishing that any one of them could crush equals.

Time passed slowly, and an hour slipped by. Luotian’s body bore grievous wounds—unhealable, clearly wounded severely by the four.

Though Luotian was in agony, the Purple Frost Clan youth fared worse—his head crushed by a single kick.

“Let’s end this!” Luotian roared, his state at its worst. He transformed into a streak of light, no longer using techniques—his body alone struck the youth.

“Fear me? I’ll see who dies!” The Purple Frost Clan youth, having reached this level at such a young age, was naturally arrogant. Luotian’s treatment of him as a soft target had enraged him beyond reason. Facing such an attack, he could not withstand it—his body radiated violet light and charged toward Luotian.

“Don’t be reckless! Let’s wear him down!” The other three Approximate Kings shouted, but their words were too late.

“Crack…” Before they could finish speaking, Luotian and the youth collided—thunder roared, and the shockwaves were deafening. Their bodies exploded into two clouds of blood, scattering in space.

“Buzz…” From the golden blood mist, Luotian’s soul quickly emerged, sacrificing everything to rush toward the violet blood mist.

“Roar…” The violet blood mist also produced a purple soul—this was the Purple Frost Clan youth.

“Die!” An overwhelming aura radiated from Luotian’s soul, and he pointed his finger at the purple soul.

An invisible wave erupted from his hand, striking the youth’s soul.

“No…” As Luotian pointed, the youth’s soul froze mid-flight, its purple eyes filled with terror. It gazed at Luotian and screamed in agony.

“What’s happening!” The three Approximate Kings gazed at the sudden result, stunned—this battle had been too fast.

“Boom…” As they were shocked, the Purple Frost Clan youth’s soul exploded into a series of violet mist, dispersing within the frost.

With the soul’s disappearance, the violet blood also lost vitality, scattering into space.

“How is this possible!” The three Approximate Kings gazed at the drifting violet blood, disbelief in their eyes. They could not believe their clan’s youth had died like this.

“You dare!” But soon, they realized the truth and glared at Luotian’s soul with cold eyes.

“Boom…” The three moved swiftly, attacking toward Luotian immediately—overwhelming auras sweeping over him.

“Go to hell, I’m not playing anymore!” Luotian stood still, his body weak and unable to withstand three Approximate Kings. Killing one was enough for him.

“Boom…” Three auras struck Luotian’s soul, instantly annihilating it in space.

“Ah…” Extreme pain surged through Luotian’s body, and he felt death again.

Yet, as his soul was annihilated, he did not return to his body but instead took another form, observing the events. This left Luotian in bitter self-mockery.

“I never expected Humanity’s Approximate Kings to be so formidable. It seems these years of the clan ignoring us have allowed Humanity to flourish. Return and contact other clans—exterminate these Humans!” The three Purple Frost Clan Approximate Kings exchanged glances, then moved swiftly, collecting the youth’s blood and vanishing into space.

As the three left, the cosmos gradually fell silent. Luotian was puzzled about his current state.

“Am I dead?” He thought, heart pounding—his mind was unsure of what death felt like.

“Damn it! What does this mean, Omen Master? Give me a clear answer!” Luotian’s mind cried out, fear spreading through his soul. He was terrified of truly dying.

“Buzz…” As Luotian’s fear deepened, the starry space was torn again. A young figure appeared beneath the stars.

“Ah…” A desperate scream echoed through space, and the strong figure rushed toward where Luotian’s blood had fallen.

“Soul-Cutting Master!” Luotian’s spirit trembled, recognizing the figure and continuing to observe.

“Indeed, he has ascended to the Approximate Epoch Master level!” Luotian smiled internally. He naturally knew the Soul-Cutting Master would have a massive power boost.

“Big Brother Tianchi, I’ve returned too late!” As Luotian smiled, Wang Duantian’s figure appeared from space. A lifeless blood droplet hovered in his hand, and Wang Duantian collected it with a sorrowful expression.

“Big Brother Qiu, I’ll avenge you with the Purple Frost Clan!” Wang Duantian spoke softly, gazing into space before moving swiftly toward the Sky-Soaring Continent.

“Exactly what has the Soul-Cutting Master endured? The Epoch Book must now be with him!” Luotian mused, the scene changing again to reveal the Sky-Soaring Continent.

“Boom…” The vast cosmos exploded, and a series of powerful figures filled space, causing Luotian’s spirit to tremble.

“The Ancient Clans!” Luotian’s spirit jolted, gazing at the overwhelming forces. He felt immense awe.

The Nine Ancient Clan Kings stood at the forefront, each sending two Approximate Kings. Behind these eighteen, dozens of other clan’s Approximate Kings stood—these were top-tier clans within the Ancient Clans.

Chapter 1515: The Soul-Cutting Master

“The Ancient Clans are truly formidable!” Luotian mused, gazing at the titanic figures. He knew that without an Epoch Master’s presence, the Sky-Soaring Continent could not withstand them.

The Sky-Soaring Continent had developed rapidly over the years, producing three Approximate Epoch Masters—Luotian’s opponent Lu Feizhou was one. Another was the top prodigy of the Sky-Soaring Rankings, who had become Qiu Tianchi. Yet this one was slain by the Purple Frost Clan.

“Humanity, who gave you the courage to defy the Ancient Clans?” The clan’s dozens of Approximate Kings roared, their eyes cold as they gazed at the Sky-Soaring Continent.

“Humanity is a race too! Why should we be oppressed like beasts?” A low voice echoed from the Sky-Soaring Continent, and five figures emerged.

Five Human Approximate Epoch Masters stood at the front, their eyes filled with anger as they gazed at the Ancient Clans.

“Haha! Humanity, a lowly race—how dare you challenge the Ancient Clans? Without our permission, do you think you could reach this level?” The dozens of clan Approximate Kings sneered at the furious crowd.

“Now, give you a chance—disband the Sky-Soaring Continent and return to your rightful place. Otherwise, exterminate your race!”

“Additionally, the Epoch Book was stolen—our suspicions fall on you Humanity. Hand over the Epoch Book!” A cold voice echoed through space, commanding dominance and dismissing Humanity entirely.

“Impossible! Humanity no longer wishes to be under the Ancient Clans—living like this is meaningless!” The Human Approximate Epoch Masters spoke firmly, addressing the Ancient Clans.

“Haha! Then we shall strike!” The Ancient Clans’ Approximate Kings spoke coldly, their auras reaching the heavens.

“Rather die than live in submission!” The Human Approximate Epoch Masters roared, their voices filled with madness.

“Exterminate them!” The Ancient Clans’ Approximate Kings spoke softly, and the twenty-plus kings moved their hands. A terrifying aura surged from their palms.

The Ancient Clans’ forces stood behind the Approximate Kings, needing no direct combat—twenty-plus kings could crush this small Sky-Soaring Continent.

A sense of oppression filled the Humans’ hearts, a feeling of helplessness rising within them.

“Do not fight!” The five Approximate Epoch Masters stood at the front, gazing at the twenty-plus kings. Their bodies radiated a terrifying aura.

“You seek death! If you submit, you may live on—but you do not cherish this chance!” The Ancient Clans’ kings spoke loudly, as if preparing a devastating attack to annihilate the Sky-Soaring Continent and its people.

Yet, as the Ancient Clans’ kings gathered their power, preparing to strike and destroy the Sky-Soaring Continent’s people, a supreme aura emerged from the continent.

“Boom…” As this aura spread, the Ancient Clans’ kings’ rapidly gathered techniques instantly collapsed. They scattered into terrifying power, drifting through space.

“What’s happening!” All gazes shifted in shock—this aura had surpassed the twenty-plus kings’ might.

“Kingly aura!” The clan’s Approximate Kings’ faces changed, gazing at the Sky-Soaring Continent with disbelief.

“How could Humanity produce such a being!” The Ancient Clans gasped in unison.

Not only were the Ancient Clans stunned, but Humanity’s side also bore disbelief—how could Humanity have someone who had ascended to the Epoch Master level?

“Epoch Master!” The five Human Approximate Kings bore excitement, having predicted that their next level was a King equivalent to the clan. Hence, they named themselves Approximate Epoch Masters.

“Boom…” After the twenty-plus kings’ techniques collapsed, they carried terrifying power and were drawn toward the Sky-Soaring Continent.

The cosmos darkened, filled with this supreme aura—stars flickered in and out of existence.

“Do you seek to flatten our Sky-Soaring Continent?” A deep voice echoed from the continent. Simultaneously, a golden hand emerged from it, slowly flying outward.

The golden hand expanded as it flew, and in an instant, it exited the continent and appeared before everyone.

“Epoch Power—achieving Epoch Master!” Luotian’s spirit trembled, gazing at the boundless power of the golden hand. Even without experiencing it himself, he could sense its world-destroying aura—far surpassing his attacks at the Approximate King level.
