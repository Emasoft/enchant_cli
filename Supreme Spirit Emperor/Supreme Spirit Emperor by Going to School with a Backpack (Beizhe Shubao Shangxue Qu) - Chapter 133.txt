Afterward, Luo Tian was somewhat surprised. It was already nightfall, yet Jin Wulong's Nascent Soul had not vanished; instead, it rushed toward him at breakneck speed without employing any concealment techniques. His presence remained invisible to the naked eye, but only Luo Tian's extraordinary spiritual awareness allowed him to perceive it.

"Why can't I detect Jin Wulong's presence?!" Zheng Xin frowned, gazing into the void.

"South Domain's top-tier talent ranks third—Jin Wulong's power has exceeded our expectations. Though I'm ranked fifth, the gap between us is immense!" Zhou Ziyang sighed, recalling their previous confrontation.

"Jin Wulong possesses dual attributes of darkness and light. Whether in night or day, environmental factors grant him a terrifying enhancement. Especially during the transition between black and white, his strength is unmatched even by Convergence Soul Initial Stage!" Zhou Ziyang's sigh continued as he explained to Zheng Xin.

"Boom..." As they spoke, thunderous roars echoed from the sky, accompanied by bursts of sparks visible to their eyes—resulting from the clash between the Rupture Spear and Jin Wulong's long sword.

Chapter 651: I Have Lost

"Haha..." Jin Wulong laughed, his face alight with excitement. He placed his black long sword before him, discarding his weapon. His body no longer merged with the void but radiated brilliant light, like a sun illuminating the entire sky.

"Ah..." Luo Tian exhaled deeply, his face bearing a faint smile. Though Jin Wulong was immensely powerful, Luo Tian knew he still lagged slightly behind him after their fight.

Jin Wulong realized this, abandoning his weapon. Though his long sword was a treasure, it paled in comparison to Luo Tian's Heaven-Level Rupture Spear.

"Body refinement?" Luo Tian smiled, confident in his physical prowess. He transformed into a dazzling array of seven colors, streaking toward Jin Wulong.

"Boom..." Under Zheng Xin and Zhou Ziyang's astonished gazes, the two clashed. Invisible waves tore through the black sky, revealing a clear spectacle under blinding light.

Wind surged, rustling Zheng Xin and Zhou Ziyang's robes, leaving them in awe.

"Evenly matched!" Zheng Xin and Zhou Ziyang exchanged glances, their eyes filled with disbelief.

"Unexpectedly, someone's body refinement could match Zhou Ziyang's!"
"Unexpectedly, someone's body refinement could rival Luo Tian's!" They spoke in unison, their tones identical.

"Uh..." They exchanged glances, then chuckled lightly.

"Again!" Jin Wulong laughed heartily, his body emitting roaring dragon cries. His joints cracked with resounding sounds, as if he had activated some special method to enhance his strength.

"Rising Dragon Transformation! I never thought Luo Tian would force Jin Wulong to use it!" Zhou Ziyang remarked, his gaze filled with admiration.

"Secret techniques?" Luo Tian furrowed his brow, marveling at the South Domain's abundance of hidden methods.

Luo Han's Four Symbols Collapse, Yue Rong's Blue Lotus Transformation—now Jin Wulong was also employing secret techniques to amplify his strength.

Luo Tian understood that if he advanced past the Six Steps of Sealing Heaven, his overwhelming冲击 could match Jin Wulong's. However, such a clash would leave both severely wounded—unwise for a mere sparring match.

As for the Soul-Consuming Technique, Luo Tian would never reveal it unless desperate. His mind raced as he observed Jin Wulong's escalating aura.

At that moment, Jin Wulong's power had reached its peak, nearly attaining the Convergence Soul Stage. More alarming was his body refinement—Luo Tian believed Jin Wulong's physique had already achieved Convergence Soul.

"Alright, I'll have to resort to some tricks," Luo Tian's lips curled slightly. He channeled his energy, merging the Five Elements Mutual Generation Imperial Seal with the Soul-Stealing Seal.

"Technique fusion?" Jin Wulong sensed a threat as the two techniques merged in the sky.

Luo Tian's energy and spiritual awareness were now colossal, and the resulting Imperial Seal rivaled Heaven-Level techniques. Compared to his previous performance in the Immortal Ancient World, its power had ascended another tier.

"Break Heaven!" Luo Tian roared, a golden seal slicing through the dark sky, visible to all.

"Three Seals as One!" Ignoring Luo Tian's and Jin Wulong's astonishment, Luo Tian smiled.

"Damn it, Luo Tian! Are you really going to do this?!" Zheng Xin's face turned red with anger, instinctively flying away.

"Run!" Zheng Xin shouted at Zhou Ziyang and Jin Wulong, his expression anxious. He recalled how Luo Tian had nearly destroyed the Heart-Testing Sect with the same method.

With no Sima Chen or Xu De Shui—those who had glimpsed the chaos power—to withstand another attack like that, no one could endure Luo Tian's assault. Moreover, his strength had grown immensely, from Soul-Consuming Intermediate to Soul-Consuming Peak.

Zhou Ziyang and Jin Wulong exchanged puzzled glances at Zheng Xin's frantic escape. Though the three-seal fusion was astonishing, it warranted a Soul-Consuming Late Stage's retreat.

"Buzz..." A powerful surge formed in the sky, a golden seal radiating overwhelming might as Luo Tian fused it into view.

"Terrifying!" Jin Wulong's first reaction was terror—this was a Heaven-Level High-Grade technique, one he could not withstand.

"Damn it!" Zheng Xin cursed, gazing at the fused seal with a pained expression. Though the golden seal was fearsome, it did not warrant his escape. What terrified him was Luo Tian's previous gray seal—its terror was unbearable, making this golden one seem like a child's firecracker.

Luo Tian would never use the seal infused with chaos power—it was a mutual destruction tactic, and he had learned his lesson once. This three-seal fusion was far more conventional, merely combining the power of three seals without any changes.

"Sky, Earth, Humanity!" The three characters appeared on the seal, hovering above Jin Wulong's head. Jin Wulong dared not move an inch.

"I yield!" Jin Wulong smiled bitterly, addressing Luo Tian.

"Haha, my apologies, Jin Xiong!" Luo Tian waved his hand, and the seal dissipated into dense spiritual energy, dispersing into the air.

"For ten years, if Luo Xiong needs my help, I will not refuse!" Jin Wulong clasped his fists, his expression solemn.

"Don't worry, Jin Xiong. I'll only ask for your help against the Corpse Sect. Otherwise, you remain free!" Luo Tian felt a surge of joy. Though their fight was brief, Jin Wulong's strength was undeniable, especially with his backing faction and influence.

"..."

Zhou Ziyang stood speechless, cursing inwardly—what the hell was I supposed to do?

Zheng Xin flew back from afar, his face flushed with embarrassment. He recalled his earlier actions, feeling a slight blush. Yet Zheng Xin's skin was thick; he chuckled and addressed the group: "Everyone, we're now allies. How about we sit down and chat for three days and nights?"

"Buzz..." As Zheng Xin's words faded, the Dark Palace beneath them erupted with overwhelming black energy.

Chapter 652: Choice

Chapter 652: Choice

Prolific black energy radiated from the group, forming strange symbols above Qichen's head. Luo Tian and others narrowed their eyes.

"Has it begun?" Luo Tian murmured, gazing at Qichen with hope that he would claim the greatest boon of the Dark Palace.

Yet Luo Tian knew Qichen's path to securing the ultimate inheritance was daunting. The existence of a cultivator loomed like a mountain over all, especially with Shangguan Hongtu.

"Buzz..." The strange symbols were not immediately obvious in the night but clearly circled above those seated on the ground.

Suddenly, dark attribute spiritual energy surged from the sky, brightening the heavens as if drawn by the black symbols above.

"Terrifying suction! So dense with dark attribute spiritual energy!" Jin Wulong's eyes gleamed with envy, watching the seated group enveloped in black spiritual energy.

Jin Wulong himself possessed half a dark attribute physique, giving him an innate sensitivity to darkness. The dense spiritual energy even stirred his desire.

"Black symbols coiled with dark spiritual energy, forming a black dragon that snarled lowly, its eyes like real pupils scanning Qichen and others as if facing a choice."

"Is this the Dark Palace's inheritance?" Zhou Ziyang frowned, gazing at the dragon below. If chosen by it, one's strength would soar significantly.

"I think the dragon is more likely to choose Shangguan Hongtu. After all, he obtained the main command of the Immortal Ancient Road—his advantage is overwhelming!" Jin Wulong spoke softly.

Besides Luo Tian, Zheng Xin and Zhou Ziyang nodded in agreement. In the Immortal Ancient Expanse, the main command of the Immortal Ancient Road was akin to a cheat code. Luo Tian's experience in the Immortal Ancient World's Dao Sect illustrated this clearly.

"In fact, Qichen has a good chance too. He's mysterious; without Tianluo's interference, he's undeniably the top of the South Domain!" The three debated.

Luo Tian remained calm, watching Qichen in meditation. He genuinely hoped Qichen would obtain the inheritance.

"Roar..." After scanning everyone, the black spiritual energy dragon dove downward, rushing toward those seated on the ground. It paused briefly before snarling toward Qichen, whose face bore a sorrowful expression. Black symbols wrapped around him, and the densest dark spiritual energy enveloped him.

"Who is this man?"
"He seems familiar!" Zhou Ziyang and Jin Wulong's faces showed disbelief, gazing at Qichen with contemplation.

"He is my elder brother!" Luo Tian was slightly surprised, then his lips curled.

"Dayum! You two are both变态!" To be chosen by the Dark Palace's inheritance, Jin Wulong and others did not consider Qichen ordinary.

Ten seconds passed swiftly; Qichen's body emitted thunderous roars, and spiritual energy from the world converged toward him.

Shangguan Hongtu and others opened their eyes, their gazes sharp, finally settling on Qichen.

Shangguan Hongtu's eyes flashed with killing intent before turning complex, settling into silence. When he revealed his intent, a colder aura locked onto him instantly, ready to unleash a terrifying attack should he act.

"Luo Tian!" Shangguan Hongtu gazed at the source of the killing intent, his face complex. He truly feared Luo Tian.

Each time Shangguan Hongtu believed he would win, he was crushed by Luo Tian's feet. This left him devoid of any desire to retaliate against Luo Tian.

Meanwhile, Xiu gazed calmly at Qichen absorbing spiritual energy before his eyes narrowed slightly toward Luo Tian in the sky.

"Buzz..." A faint vibration echoed, and Xiu's figure vanished from sight, tightening Luo Tian's mind. His body was surrounded by powerful killing intent.

"Buzz..." The Rupture Spear returned to his hand, his gaze cautious as he extended his spiritual awareness.

"You have a grudge with Xiu the monster?" Jin Wulong's face showed alarm upon seeing Luo Tian's actions. He sensed Xiu's cultivation was nearing Convergence Soul.

"A little, I almost died at his hands!" Luo Tian's lips curled slightly before he sheathed the Rupture Spear in Zheng Xin and others' sight.

"What are you doing, Luo Tian?!" Zheng Xin's face turned anxious as he flew in front of Luo Tian.

Jin Wulong and others were also bewildered by Luo Tian's actions. Xiu's killing intent was formidable, which they felt; yet Luo Tian made no resistance, leaving them astounded.

"Haha! This kid's gone mad!" Shangguan Hongtu grinned, delightedly watching Luo Tian's actions.

Xiu's strength was well-known to Shangguan Hongtu, the strongest assassin of the Yeluo Sect. None could escape Xiu's assassination in his rank.

Now, Xiu had taken an interest in Luo Tian, thrilling Shangguan Hongtu.

As people were astonished, Xiu's figure slowly appeared before Luo Tian, his black head resting on Luo Tian's neck, causing Zheng Xin to gasp.

"Good!" Shangguan Hongtu's face lit with excitement, watching Xiu await the head's fall.

Yet the following scene left everyone wide-eyed: Xiu's gaze held amusement, his voice calm in the air. "Do you believe I'll kill you?"

"No!" Luo Tian's lips curled, recalling their meeting in the Wind Valley.

"Alright, you've won! Besides that guy, you're my second person I acknowledge!" Xiu sighed, vanishing again and reappearing before Shangguan Hongtu.

"What's going on? Aren't they enemies?" Shangguan Hongtu gazed at Xiu standing beside him, his face filled with disbelief. He never expected the cold-blooded Xiu to show such a side.

"Ah..." Zheng Xin exhaled lightly, realizing it was too dangerous. He hadn't sensed Xiu's presence at all. When had he arrived?

Chapter 653: Gathering of the Celestial Prodigies

Chapter 653: Gathering of the Celestial Prodigies

Luo Tian's face remained calm, his gaze playful toward Shangguan Hongtu. It wasn't that he couldn't react; he realized the killing intent Xiu released was identical to when he repelled Yue Rong.

Thus, Luo Tian was certain Xiu wouldn't kill him. Otherwise, when he was still an ordinary person, Xiu could have killed him effortlessly without waiting until now.

"Boom..." A deep sound echoed in people's ears, drawing their attention to Qichen.

"He's advanced to Soul-Consuming Peak!" Luo Tian's face lit with excitement, amazed the Dark Palace's inheritance was so powerful it elevated Qichen from Soul-Consuming Intermediate to Peak.

"Damn! If I had obtained this inheritance, I could have entered Convergence Soul!" Shangguan Hongtu gritted his teeth, wishing to kill Qichen.

Shangguan Hongtu knew that with Luo Tian around, he'd be lucky not to trouble him. As for Xiu? Nonsense—though his status in Yeluo Sect was prestigious, Shangguan Hongtu knew even his father, the current sect leader, would consult Xiu with a polite tone.

"Roar..." Qichen's black hair floated as dark spiritual energy swirled around him.

At this moment, Qichen was霸道, his presence akin to a king of the night. Though he stood still, his aura intimidated Luo Tian.

Ning Qingzhu smiled gently, her usual liveliness replaced by warmth as she gazed at Qichen.

After several tens of seconds, Qichen finally calmed down, his aura stabilizing as he opened his eyes—two stars glowing in the night.

"Corpse Sect!" Qichen spoke, his voice filled with endless hatred, emitting cold waves.

"Senior Brother? What's wrong?" Luo Tian frowned, gazing at Qichen.

"Nothing... just recalling some things!" Qichen turned, his stiff face forcing a smile toward Luo Tian.

Seeing Qichen's smile, Luo Tian felt warmth, approaching him and bowing slightly.

As they spoke, both abruptly halted, exchanging glances with solemn expressions, their bodies tensed as if facing an enemy.

Not only Luo Tian and his elder brother, but Xiu and Jin Wulong also bore tense expressions.

"What's wrong?" Some Soul-Consuming Initial Stage prodigies of the Tianyuan Continent looked puzzled at the group's tense demeanor, failing to notice any anomaly.

"Come out! You're playing tricks!" Xiu's face turned calm, shouting into the void. His voice wasn't loud but carried far.

"Xiu, I didn't expect your strength to have improved again!" A cold voice echoed, making Luo Tian's heart tremble.

"Convergence Soul Stage!" Upon hearing the voice, Luo Tian sighed. He sensed the opponent's strength and murmured.

He had thought he had no rivals in this Immortal Ancient Expanse, but now a Convergence Soul Stage powerhouse appeared. The voice was young and familiar with Xiu.

"Who is it?" Luo Tian asked, gazing at Xiu for an answer.

"Tianluo!" Xiu's lips curled slightly, his expression devoid of emotion, even crossing his arms behind his back.

Hearing Xiu's calm words, others gasped in disbelief, exchanging glances.

Tianluo was a legend among the younger generation of the South Domain, ranking first in talent. Few had seen his true face; no one knew his sect. Legends claimed Tianluo was a wandering cultivator, but people never believed a wandering cultivator could reach such heights. If he were truly a wanderer, his talent would be unparalleled.

"Still recognize me?" A calm voice echoed again, a figure silently appearing in Luo Tian's group.

Young—Luo Tian's first thought was this youth's youth, followed by his face being unremarkable. Like Xiu.

"Don't be deceived by his appearance; this guy never shows his true face. Every time I see him, he takes a new form!" Xiu's lazy voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Why are you so leisurely today?" Xiu clenched his fists, his gaze fierce despite the opponent being Convergence Soul.

"You mean he's the one you acknowledged?" Luo Tian smiled, his words echoing in Xiu's mind.

Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Xiu's body trembled slightly before nodding.

Seeing Xiu's nod, Luo Tian's eyes sparkled with interest as he gazed at Tianluo. Xiu was peculiar; few people could earn his acknowledgment.

"Many old friends are here, I've come to join the fun. Also, put away those two broken heads; fighting all the time is pointless. We've known each other for years, can't we sit down and chat? I don't often find someone who understands me. Let's talk about the last time..." Tianluo spoke, a string of words leaving everyone speechless.

"Uh..." Luo Tian was also stunned, gazing at Tianluo. He never expected the formidable Tianluo to be a chatterbox like Zheng Xin.

Zheng Xin's face glowed slightly, his eyes filled with the joy of finding a kindred spirit. He secretly marveled at how this trip to the Immortal Ancient Expanse hadn't been in vain, meeting both Xu Liyi and now this.

Zheng Xin was about to enthusiastically greet Tianluo but forgot Tianluo's cultivation and personality. He only knew he was Zheng Xin's kindred spirit.

But before Zheng Xin could speak, an unsympathetic voice echoed from the ground, interrupting him.

"Xiu! Do you remember the Dragon Poison Sect you annihilated?" A young voice echoed from afar, rolling like thunder, making Luo Tian's group tense again.

"This is the South Domain's top-tier talent ranked fourth, Xu Heping!" Zhou Ziyang furrowed his brows, gazing at the figures arriving from afar.

"The top five of the South Domain's talents have all arrived—this is rare!" Luo Tian smiled upon hearing Zhou Ziyang's words, sighing in admiration.

Chapter 654: Tianluo's Might

Chapter 654: Tianluo's Might!

"Xiu!" Xu Heping and his companions instantly appeared before the group, their eyes locked on Tianluo with intense hatred.

"Get lost... I'm talking, you dare interrupt!" Tianluo sneered, his gaze icy. The temperature around the world seemed to shift as he waved his hand, sending gusts of wind.

Xu Heping's face darkened instantly; he was flung back thousands of feet, his hair disheveled and a clear red handprint on his face.

"Uh..." Zheng Xin, about to greet Tianluo, felt a chill. He had taken a step forward but stopped before speaking. If he had spoken, Zheng Xin wasn't sure if he would have been the one flung away.

Though Luo Tian was powerful, he was only at Soul-Consuming Peak. Zheng Xin didn't believe Luo Tian could stop an enraged Tianluo.

Thinking this, Zheng Xin felt gratitude toward Xu Heping for his timely interruption.

"Dragon Poison Sect? You annihilated it?" Xiu's face was calm, knowing Tianluo's nature. If he approved of someone, he'd become a chatterbox; if not, he was cold and merciless.

"Dragon Poison Sect? Let me think... I suppose so. I can't remember clearly; I've annihilated so many, how could I recall them all? You know my memory's bad. I even forgot how many people I killed when I annihilated the Flame Fire Sect!" Tianluo spoke carelessly, ignoring others' gazes as he rambled.

The surrounding people's mouths twitched involuntarily. The Dragon Poison Sect was a minor but renowned sect in the South Domain. Three years ago, it was bloodily annihilated—no one knew who did it.

Today hearing Tianluo's admission, they were stunned to learn it was this man. From his words, it seemed he had forgotten how many sects he'd annihilated.

"A strange fellow!" Luo Tian's gaze turned odd, labeling Tianluo as extremely dangerous.

At the same time, Luo Tian admired Xiu's resilience; Tianluo's peculiar temperament left Xiu always eager to fight. In Luo Tian's mind, Xiu was also labeled a monster.

Luo Tian had no idea he himself was labeled a monster in others' eyes.

As the group marveled, Xu Heping and his companions returned, their red handprint clearly visible. Zheng Xin instinctively shivered.

"Xiu! You annihilated my Dragon Poison Sect, today I'll make you repay with blood!" Xu Heping's face twisted with hatred. His companions also bore resentment, gazing at Tianluo.

"Since you're not dead, why aren't you being good? You still come to avenge!" Tianluo's voice turned icy, his previous joviality replaced by a hellish demon.

"You're indeed powerful, but do you think I've made no preparations for revenge over these years?" Xu Heping spoke coldly, raising his hand.

Seeing Xu Heping raise his hand, his companions' eyes flashed with coldness as they moved to surround him.

"Everyone disperse! This is between us and Xiu—nothing to do with you!" Xu Heping's eyes glowed bloodily, scanning Luo Tian and others.

"I see I made a mistake not killing you all back then!" Tianluo shook his head, his voice carrying a hint of regret. He appeared in the sky, allowing them to surround him.

"This fellow, though peculiar, has principles—he never kills a good person. Thus, he's quite kind, even more so than you! Over the years, the sects he annihilated were all villains!" Xiu's lips curled slightly, showing no concern for Tianluo as he conveyed to Luo Tian.

Hearing Xiu's words, Luo Tian's interest deepened further; he longed to witness Tianluo's abilities.

"Deploy the Heaven-World Bloodlust Array!" Xu Heping spoke, his body moving to face Tianluo.

"Roar..." Upon hearing Xu Heping's words, his companions roared, their bodies awash with blood. Terrifying energy radiated from them.

Under Luo Tian's astonished gaze, they expanded, transforming into a sea of blood mist swirling through the heavens.

"Absorb..." Xu Heping's face twisted with madness, his body absorbing the spiritual energy of over a dozen Soul-Consuming Stage cultivators.

"Crack..." As Luo Tian and others marveled, Xu Heping's aura surged, his body emitting crackling sounds. The sight of cracks sent shivers down their spines.

"Convergence Soul Initial Stage?" Tianluo's eyes flashed with contempt, gazing at Xu Heping now at Convergence Soul Initial Stage.

A red long sword appeared in Xu Heping's hand. His body resembled a bloodied man, transforming into a streak of blood that roared toward Tianluo.

"Annoying—using secret techniques to reach Convergence Soul Initial Stage, yet you dare fight me?" Tianluo's eyes flashed with coldness. His body became intangible, showing no fear as he rushed toward Xu Heping without even drawing a weapon. He met Xu Heping's blood sword with his bare fist.

"Buzz..." A piercing buzz echoed in people's ears, even making Luo Tian feel a shiver.

In the next moment, Luo Tian's eyes widened in disbelief at the scene above.

Tianluo and Xu Heping's blood sword clashed violently. In an instant, Xu Heping's sword was thrown away into the void, and his half-arm was severed.

"Convergence Soul Initial Stage—truly formidable!" Luo Tian and others sighed, sensing their gap with the Convergence Soul Stage.

"Do you think this is over?" Xu Heping spoke, his body emitting thunderous roars as if preparing something.

"Self-Explosion!"
"Retreat!" Luo Tian and others gasped, transforming into streaks of light to flee.

Luo Tian had witnessed the self-explosion of a Convergence Soul Stage powerhouse; even ten of him couldn't withstand it. Though Xu Heping had reached Convergence Soul Stage through special methods, his self-explosion's power was beyond their capacity.

"Self-Explosion? You're not worthy of it in front of me!" Tianluo sneered, pointing his finger. A thin thread of gray energy shot from his fingertip, making Luo Tian and others widen their eyes.

Chapter 655: The Tomb of the World Lord

Chapter 655: The Tomb of the World Lord

Luo Tian and others stared at that thread of gray energy, their minds shaking. They couldn't help but be astonished—though the thread seemed ordinary, it made Xu Heping tremble instantly upon appearance.

"Chaos power! This fellow also has chaos power!" Luo Tian's heart surged with waves. He never expected to meet someone like himself—without reaching Convergence Soul Peak, yet possessing chaos power. Moreover, this thread of chaos power was far greater than the one Sima Chen had placed in his body.

"Who is this fellow?"
"Chaos power! How many Convergence Soul Peak masters lack chaos power! Tianluo has it!" People murmured.

As they spoke, the thread of chaos power shot from Tianluo's hand, wrapping around Xu Heping.

"You people's talent—ascending to Soul-Consuming Stage—how many lives have you残害? Ah, I shouldn't have been merciful back then! Now you can die!" Tianluo's eyes turned cold, his hands clenching.

"Pu..." Xu Heping's shocked gaze watched the gray thread slice him in two, scattering into a shower of blood. Blood splattered on Tianluo's face, making him look grotesque.

"Dead?" Zhou Ziyang's eyes trembled as he gazed at Tianluo, stunned that the South Domain's fourth-ranked talent, Xu Heping, was so easily killed.

Tianluo wiped the blood from his face, then smiled again. He appeared before Xiu and began speaking as if he had just crushed an ant.

Xiu felt his head ache, gazing at Luo Tian's joy. His lips curled slightly: "Tianluo, I'll introduce someone to you—believe you'll find him quite interesting!"

"Who? Someone who could catch your eye is definitely worth meeting!" Tianluo's face showed interest, following Xiu's gaze to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian was still watching Xiu's antics but hadn't expected Xiu to shift his attention to himself.

"Ah! Not bad, no wonder Xiu found you appealing!" Tianluo spoke, his eyes flashing with intense light.

Seeing Tianluo's interested gaze, Luo Tian inwardly winced but smiled outwardly, engaging in small talk with Tianluo.

Tianluo, however, seemed to know Luo Tian instantly, shifting his gaze from Xiu to Luo Tian. He spoke increasingly excitedly.

People were stunned, watching Tianluo. Some young talents from the Tianyuan Continent who hadn't met Tianluo before couldn't believe their eyes. They never expected the mysterious Tianluo to be so approachable, lacking any aura of a master.

Yet they dared not underestimate Tianluo—his effortless annihilation of Xu Heping left a deep impression. Even Jin Wulong hesitated to speak, fearing Tianluo might turn on him next.

Finally, Luo Tian couldn't bear Tianluo's enthusiasm and grabbed Zheng Xin, who had his eyes glowing with intensity but dared not speak due to his strength.

"Hey, Tianluo Senior Brother, let me introduce you—this is my brother Zheng Xin. I'm sure the two of you will have much in common!" Luo Tian smiled at Tianluo.

Tianluo shifted his gaze to Zheng Xin, initially sensing his strength was unimpressive. After exchanging glances with Zheng Xin, he furrowed his brows slightly.

With Luo Tian's introduction, Zheng Xin finally mustered courage, his face filled with excitement as he spoke softly, reverting to his chatterbox nature.

"Kindred spirit!" Tianluo immediately showed mutual understanding, a look of 'you understand me' in his eyes. The two began chatting loudly in the sky, leaving those around them speechless.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian stared wordlessly at the two, his storage talisman emitted a glow. Lei Yong's voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears.

Not only Luo Tian, but others' talismans also buzzed, their faces lighting up with surprise.

"Little Brother, come quickly! I've discovered the tomb of the World Lord!" Lei Yong's words were straightforward but stirred waves in Luo Tian's heart.

World Lord—Luo Tian knew it was the highest cultivation realm. Achieving World Lord status meant sweeping across the entire Tianyuan Continent and the Xianyuan Continent. World Lords were legendary figures, nearly extinct in current times.
