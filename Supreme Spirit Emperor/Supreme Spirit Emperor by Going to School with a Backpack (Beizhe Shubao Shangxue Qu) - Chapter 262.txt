“Petals of the Heavenly Mirage Divine Flower! By the heavens, the petals of the Eternally Immortal Life-Death Bamboo! How did Luo Tian obtain them!” The people’s eyes reflected terror, gazing at the petals floating in the sky. Though it was but a single petal, its vitality surpassed that of the Eternally Immortal Life-Death Bamboo.

“The blood of the Dragon Ancestor and Phoenix Ancestor, the Eternally Immortal Life-Death Bamboo, the petals of the Heavenly Mirage Divine Flower—each is a treasure sought after by the world. How did Luo Tian manage to gather these rare items?” The people’s faces bore awe.

“Four legendary treasures, all for a single alchemical furnace! I truly wish to see what extraordinary elixir Luo Tian will craft!” The people were astounded by Luo Tian’s audacity. None had left, and even the sages who had departed earlier returned to the gates of the Divine Clan, their eyes gleaming with intensity as they gazed upon Luo Tian.

At that moment, Luo Tian’s face was drenched in cold sweat. This was his first attempt at refining such a difficult elixir. His formidable spiritual awareness remained undivided, meticulously observing the transformation of the medicinal liquid. He had no surplus herbs, so success was imperative.

“Refinement of the elixir complete!” After half a day of arduous refinement, Luo Tian finally condensed the Eternally Immortal Life-Death Bamboo and the petals of the Heavenly Mirage Divine Flower. This was only possible due to the advancement of his Blue Crystal Jade Fire; if it had remained at its former level, he estimated it would have taken a full day.

“Now! The final stage of elixir formation!” Luo Tian’s face lit with joy. He extended his hand, and his spiritual awareness enveloped the elixir, compressing it into the final phase of alchemy.

“Woo—” A resonant hum echoed, and powerful fluctuations emanated from the Soul-Subduing Cauldron. The cries of dragons and phoenixes intertwined, black and white qi merged, and the elixir soared forth, stirring excitement among the onlookers.

“Elixir formation has begun! I wonder if it will succeed… I can sense that if it does, it will be unparalleled!” Sun Feiwen’s eyes gleamed with anticipation as he spoke aloud. Others also stared intently at Luo Tian, eager to witness his success.

“Don’t let it succeed! How could such rare herbs yield results so easily!” Yin Yang’s Saint Son’s eyes flashed with resentment, his mind cursing furiously.

“Boom—” Thunderous roars echoed as lightning crackled around the Soul-Subduing Cauldron, striking the ground and raising clouds of dust.

“Crack—” The black Soul-Subduing Cauldron developed fissures, causing the people’s faces to pale abruptly.

“Has it failed? The legendary elixir is failing!” The people’s eyes reflected regret as the cracks on the cauldron widened.

“Failure is unacceptable!” Luo Tian, too, felt the cauldron’s transformation. Not only would failure mean the elixir was lost, but if it exploded, Zhao Fengshan and his wife would vanish entirely.

Four supreme forces clashed violently, each refusing to yield, producing thunderous roars that darkened Luo Tian’s expression.

“It cannot be harmonized!” Luo Tian’s heart sank as he pondered solutions frantically.

“A bridge—only something more dominant than the four can neutralize them!” Luo Tian’s mind stirred with resolve, his eyes flashing with brilliance.

“Let’s try!” Luo Tian extended a hand, and three drops of blood erupted from his fingers. The blood transformed into radiant streams, entering the Soul-Subduing Cauldron.

“Reincarnation Body’s blood!” The people’s gazes turned to Luo Tian’s actions, their eyes wide with astonishment. They had not expected him to employ such a method.

“Woo—” The three drops of blood instantly surged into the cauldron, and a thunderous roar erupted within it.

“There’s hope!” Luo Tian’s eyes glimmered with a hint of joy. He felt the medicinal liquid, once wild and volatile, now calmed, gradually coalescing into a golden elixir.

“The blood of the Reincarnation Body is itself an extraordinary treasure. When added to the elixir, it neutralized the potent energies of the Eternally Immortal Life-Death Bamboo and the Heavenly Mirage Divine Flower!” An elder skilled in alchemy murmured, admiration flashing across his face as he observed Luo Tian’s intense focus.

“Boom—” Thunder rumbled, and black clouds coalesced in an instant, golden lightning dragons swirling within the storm.

Time passed slowly. After an hour, under the expectant gazes of all, Luo Tian, pale-faced, struck the cauldron’s lid.

“Open!” Luo Tian bellowed, his voice barely trailing off before the cauldron’s lid lifted. Thunderous lightning erupted from within, a terrifying aura instantly sweeping over the onlookers’ minds.

“What has Luo Tian refined? Even I feel its overwhelming aura!” Yan Hongtao and others gazed in shock, their eyes fixed on the thunderous Soul-Subduing Cauldron.

The thunder gradually subsided, and a beam of light pierced the sky. The golden elixir, like the sun itself, appeared in the onlookers’ sight.

“It’s done!” Luo Tian spoke, his voice tinged with joy as he gazed at the elixir he had crafted. It ascended into the sky, and only after surviving the heavenly tribulation would it be fully refined.

“Crack—” Golden heavenly thunder, imbued with the authority of heaven, descended upon the Reincarnation Elixir.

The thunderous roars never ceased; the tribulation’s power could obliterate a sage at the initial stage. Yet, it inflicted no harm upon the golden Reincarnation Elixir.

“It seems there’s no major issue!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with satisfaction, pleased with his Reincarnation Elixir.

“This elixir must be of Saint-grade high rank or even higher!” The people murmured, their gazes turning to Luo Tian.

Across the Nine Realms, countless Saint-grade alchemists existed, but those capable of refining high-rank Saint-grade elixirs were rare. Luo Tian’s achievement was exceptional.

Five-colored lightning tribulations and heavenly power continuously struck the Reincarnation Elixir, yet it remained impervious, like a sovereign ruler. No matter how the tribulations descended, they could not harm it.

The tribulation lasted an hour before gradually subsiding. The golden Reincarnation Elixir, like a bottomless abyss, began absorbing the surrounding qi of the world.

FAD

Chapter 1114: Sun Miechen ( )

Outside the Divine Clan’s gates, the golden elixir floated like a blazing sun above the crowd. The storm clouds dissipated from view, and the elixir continuously absorbed the qi of the Divine Clan’s sacred mountain. In an instant, it drained the entire mountain’s vitality, leaving the people in awe.

“Success!” Luo Tian laughed aloud, leaping into the air to stand before the Reincarnation Elixir. After countless hardships, he had finally refined it. His entire being was exhilarated.

He swiftly retrieved the elixir into a jade vial, then gazed around, speaking solemnly: “This is my gift for the Divine Clan’s daughter’s wedding. However, I shall personally deliver it to her on the day of the ceremony.”

“What? Such a precious elixir, truly given to the Divine Clan?” The people’s eyes widened in disbelief. They had not expected Luo Tian to gift such a rare elixir to the Divine Clan.

“The Divine Clan has truly gained immensely! The value of this elixir surpasses even a pseudo-epoch relic!” An elder murmured, his eyes filled with envy.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the Divine Clan’s people also displayed joyous expressions. Though they did not know the elixir’s exact function, its rarity was evident from the materials Luo Tian had used.

“Ah, Yin Yang Sect’s Saint Son… I have a question—what is your sect’s gift for the Divine Clan?” Sun Feiwen, with an amused expression, addressed Yin Yang Sect’s Saint Son.

“This….” The Yin Yang Saint Son’s faces darkened instantly. Previously, they had mocked Luo Tian for lacking a gift, but now, seeing him present such an invaluable elixir as a gift, it was like a slap across their faces.

Though Yin Yang Sect was a major sect of the Divine-Mortal Realms, even a pseudo-epoch relic would be reluctant to part with. How much more so for an elixir surpassing pseudo-epoch relics?

“Get out! You lowly creatures, thinking yourselves important. What are you anyway!” Zhu Ge Huangchao’s face was cold as he sneered at the Yin Yang Saint Son.

“Leave!” The Yin Yang Saint Son’s faces were equally grim, his eyes dark with resentment as he glared at Luo Tian. Under the people’s disdainful gazes, they entered the sacred mountain of the Divine Clan.

Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with a hint of joy, retrieving the Reincarnation Elixir and returning to where Nan Gong Yuqing and others stood. He bowed respectfully to Yan Hongtao and Zhu Ge Huangchao: “Thank you both!”

“Don’t be so polite. It was merely because I couldn’t stand seeing someone like you insulted by two petty figures. If you survive this, I’ll personally assassinate you!” Yan Hongtao shook his head lightly and entered the Divine Clan’s domain. Zhu Ge Huangchao’s eyes also brimmed with battle intent as he vanished from view.

“Alright, everyone—disperse! Go about your tasks!” Sun Feiwen addressed the crowd. The Divine Clan’s prince’s authority radiated, and he led Luo Tian and Nan Gong Yuting into the sacred mountain of the Divine Clan.

“Strange… wasn’t Luo Tian here to disrupt the Divine Clan? The Divine Clan’s daughter is about to marry the prince. Why is Sun Feiwen so enthusiastic toward Luo Tian and even aided him?” The people were bewildered by Sun Feiwen’s attitude, yet no one dared to inquire.

As Luo Tian and the others entered the Divine Clan, the line outside the gates resumed orderly.

Night had arrived after Luo Tian’s commotion; it was now deep into the night, with only half a day remaining until the wedding.

In a grand hall, Nan Gong Yuqing sat with Luo Tian, while Sun Feiwen, wearing a forced smile, sat beside them.

“Luo Tian, are you truly confident?” Nan Gong Yuqing’s face bore deep concern. As a demon clan member, he knew the demon clan’s terror; that the Divine Clan could subdue them showed how formidable they were.

“No… but some things must be done.” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with determination. No matter what, he had reached this point; if he did not continue, he would betray himself and those who had sacrificed for him.

“Sigh…” Sun Feiwen let out a long sigh, his eyes filled with bitterness. He knew Luo Tian’s chances were grim, yet he was also a Divine Clan member. Though he was the prince, even he could do nothing before the Divine King.

Time passed swiftly; sunlight illuminated Luo Tian’s face as he sat cross-legged in the hall, having reached his peak state.

“Dawn has come,” Luo Tian murmured, rising to don a clean robe. After speaking with Sun Feiwen and Nan Gong Yuqing the previous day, they had left his quarters.

He stepped out of the door, and the entire Divine Clan was joyous. Though they knew Luo Tian had arrived, none believed he would stir up any trouble before the vast Divine Clan.

Soon, Luo Tian reached the square of the Divine Clan, where a sea of people gathered. Yet as he arrived, it stirred considerable commotion.

“Luo Tian has come!” The people saw Luo Tian and automatically cleared a path, leading him to the forefront.

Above, several domain masters sat, their gazes scanning the sea of people below. When they saw Luo Tian, their eyes flickered with amusement.

“The time is nearly here,” the Divine King said to his attendant, casting a single glance at Luo Tian before no longer paying attention.

The Divine King’s command was obeyed without question by the clan leader, who slowly ascended into the sky. His deep voice echoed: “Everyone, today is our Divine Clan’s joyous day. My clan’s daughter and prince are to be united in marriage today. Thank you all for coming!”

The clan leader’s words had barely finished when a wave of applause erupted like a tidal surge, their gazes filled with reverence as they looked at the Divine King.

“Enough of the talk. Now, let us welcome our main attraction—my clan’s prince!” The clan leader spoke no more and called out, his gaze turning to the distance.

The people followed the clan leader’s gaze, and a murmur of confusion arose.

A streak of light shot from the horizon, radiating immense pressure. A young figure, like a warrior bathed in golden light, appeared before the crowd.

“Who is he? Isn’t the prince Sun Feiwen of the Divine Clan? Why has another appeared?” The people’s faces bore confusion, their voices rising in chaos.

Luo Tian also gazed at the figure above, his brows furrowing slightly. From Sun Feiwen’s words, he knew this young man was Sun Miechen, the son of the Divine King and one of the Nine Body Types—Eternal Immortal Body.

With a face as refined as jade, his features bore seven parts of resemblance to the Divine King. His aura was even more dominant, radiating powerful energy that made Luo Tian feel apprehensive.

“This is Sun Miechen? I’ve heard of him before, but now I see the living one!” Yan Hongtao’s eyes bore deep concern. Instinctively, he felt this man was no ordinary opponent.

“This is a formidable enemy—perhaps even surpassing Luo Tian! I am not his match; perhaps only my elder brother could balance him!” Zhu Ge Huangchao spoke solemnly. Since his previous defeat at Luo Tian’s hands, he had lost his former arrogance.

“Everyone is unfamiliar with him. Let me introduce him: this is my clan’s Divine King’s son, one of the Nine Body Types—Eternal Immortal Body, Sun Miechen!” The clan leader’s face bore pride as he introduced Sun Miechen to the crowd, causing a wave of shock. They had not expected the Divine Clan to possess another body type besides the daughter, and this one was of such high status—son of the Divine King.

Under the people’s astonished gazes, Sun Miechen surveyed the crowd with his eyes. Finally, he spotted Luo Tian and smirked slightly: “Don’t be foolish; I’ve claimed the Primordial Body!”

Sun Miechen’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind like thunder, deepening his resolve.

“Don’t think you can!” Luo Tian responded without hesitation, his voice carrying the power of the Dao, echoing into Sun Miechen’s mind.

“Hmph?” Sun Miechen’s face paled, his mind ringing with thunderous echoes. He gazed at Luo Tian and met his eyes.

“Opposition has begun! So quickly!” The people were excited, watching the silent confrontation between Luo Tian and Sun Miechen.

“It’s not yet time; I haven’t seen Sun Mengru, so I can’t act!” Hearing the people’s murmurs, Luo Tian gradually withdrew his gaze.

Seeing Luo Tian withdraw his eyes, the clan leader’s face bore a hint of disdain as he spoke again: “Since the groom has arrived, let us now welcome our bride!”

A phoenix’s cry echoed as a golden phoenix flew from the distance. A senior held Sun Mengru, clad in red robes, appearing before the crowd.

“She’s here!” Luo Tian clenched his fists, his body tense with anticipation as he watched Sun Mengru flying toward him. At this moment, Luo Tian’s eyes were only for Sun Mengru.

“禁制?” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with violet light; he could sense that Sun Mengru and Sun Hexi were under restrictions, clearly the Divine Clan feared any changes in the wedding.

“Go forth, groom! Welcome your bride!” The clan leader called to Sun Miechen beside him.

Sun Miechen’s eyes gleamed with a hint of joy, transforming into a golden dragon and flying toward Sun Mengru.

“Attack!” As Sun Miechen moved, Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with a golden light. He rushed forward alone, transforming into a streak of light toward Sun Mengru.

“Finally, he can’t hold back!” The people’s faces bore excitement as they watched Luo Tian burst out of the crowd.

Chapter 1115: Consuming the Reincarnation Elixir

“Attack!” Luo Tian watched Sun Miechen flying toward Sun Mengru, his gaze resolute.

“Finally, he can’t hold back!” The people saw Luo Tian’s figure and wore excitement. All wished to see how Luo Tian would disrupt this wedding.

“Has he arrived?” Sun Miechen paused, gazing at Luo Tian behind him. His eyes bore a hint of battle intent.

“The Reincarnation Body, ranked first among the Nine Body Types—let me see what ability you have to claim one I’ve set my sights on!” Sun Miechen sneered, his body radiating golden light. A streak of golden dragons coiled around him as he punched toward Luo Tian.

“Only because the Divine King supports you! Otherwise, why would you self-restrict? It was fear of not attaining the Dao!” Luo Tian saw Sun Miechen’s punch and showed no fear. Golden sacred power surged like an ocean as he punched back.

“Hmph…” The Divine King’s face remained cold, sneering without action—evidently confident in Sun Miechen.

“Crack…” Golden lightning surged between them, and invisible waves instantly scattered the golden phoenix beneath Sun Mengru and Sun Hexi.

“He has arrived!” Sun Mengru’s eyes reflected emotion, gazing at Luo Tian like a legendary warrior. Her heart was stirred again.

“This kid is truly someone!” Sun Hexi’s face bore a hint of excitement, gazing at Luo Tian. He felt some discomfort as he saw Luo Tian risking everything for Sun Mengru against the entire Divine Clan.

“This child, I fear he will not return alive!” Sun Hexi’s face bore a hint of pity as he spoke softly.

“Why did you come? Was your past so important?” Though she knew Luo Tian had come for her past, Sun Mengru felt immense emotion.

Yet she also knew that Luo Tian would not survive this time. No one had ever offended the Divine Clan and lived to tell the tale, especially not over such a major event. If Luo Tian survived, the Divine Clan would suffer a massive setback.

Thunderous roars echoed as people discussed. Luo Tian and Sun Miechen instantly separated, gazing at each other with lightning flashing in their eyes.

“Luo Tian, what do you mean?” The clan leader’s face bore anger as he rebuked Luo Tian for his impoliteness.

“Nothing in particular—just giving the Divine Clan’s daughter a gift!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with a hint of joy, showing no tension. Yet his mind was heavy.

Though they had only exchanged a punch, Luo Tian felt the opponent’s strength was no match for his. To win, he would have to pay a heavy price.

Luo Tian flicked his finger, and the golden Reincarnation Elixir flew from his hand, instantly appearing before Sun Mengru.

“Success! He truly refined the Reincarnation Elixir!” Sun Mengru’s eyes reflected emotion. At this moment, she truly wished to know what her past was like—what made this man risk everything for her.

“Eat it! Everything will return to you! You may choose not to, but I’ll still help you escape the Divine Clan. No one can force you to marry—not even the Divine Clan!” Luo Tian’s voice rang out, resolute.

Luo Tian did not use telepathy but spoke aloud, his voice echoing across the realm. The entire Divine Clan heard Luo Tian’s resolute words.

“Truly… bold!” The people’s faces bore awe, gazing at Luo Tian in the sky. A saint-level prodigy speaking thus within the Divine Clan clearly opposed the entire clan.

“Truly arrogant! I’ll see how he dies here today!” The Yin Yang Saint Son’s face bore coldness as he spoke.

“Smack—” Before they could continue, Yan Hongtao and others arrived before the Yin Yang Saint Son. They slapped them across the face with open palms.

“Do you have a right to speak here? Stay put!” Yan Hongtao’s face was cold, and he stepped on Yang Zilin and Yang Quan’s faces.

“What a piece of trash!” Sun Feiwen’s face bore coldness. If it weren’t for the Yin Yang Sect elders present, he would have killed them on the spot.

Yet people did not focus on Yan Hongtao’s incident but turned their gazes to the Divine King, wanting to know his stance. However, they found the Divine King showed no intention of acting.

The golden Reincarnation Elixir floated before Sun Mengru, illuminating her beautiful face and making her appear like a fairy.

Sun Mengru hesitated briefly, then grabbed the elixir and placed it in her mouth.

“Woo…” As Sun Mengru swallowed the elixir, furious fluctuations appeared in people’s perceptions.

Sun Mengru’s eyes reflected shock before she closed them, sitting cross-legged in the sky.

“Roar…” Golden dragon and phoenix shadows emerged from her body, circling around her.

Intense vitality filled the sky, but Sun Mengru was unaware, as if entering a strange state. Strange fluctuations radiated from her body—sometimes intangible, sometimes solid. Reincarnation power instantly enveloped Sun Mengru.

A series of fragments appeared in Sun Mengru’s mind, like a dream yet real—experiencing a cycle of rebirth. Past scenes appeared in her mind.

All watched Sun Mengru, eager to see what benefits this miraculous elixir would grant her.

Sun Mengru sat cross-legged in the sky, and her aura gradually rose, her cultivation steadily climbing.

After thirty breaths, Sun Mengru opened her eyes, radiating the aura of a saint-level late stage. It continued to climb.

“Squeak…” However, as Sun Mengru’s aura neared the saint-level peak, a small creature on her ears slowly awakened. Its eyes gleamed with greed, transforming into a streak of light and rushing into Sun Mengru’s body.

“Soul-Eating Silkworm!” Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly; he recognized the creature.

“I remember now!” Sun Mengru’s eyes glistened with tears, gazing at Luo Tian. Her voice trembled as she flew toward him.

“Yun Ting!” Luo Tian’s heart also surged with emotion, gazing at Sun Mengru and flying toward her. The two had been separated for an era but now met again.

They gazed at each other, as if no one else existed—only the two of them.

Their figures instantly embraced each other, under the eyes of the nine realms’ domain masters and all major sects.

“I’m sorry I came late!” Luo Tian’s face bore self-reproach as he embraced Sun Mengru, his eyes filled with endless tenderness.

“It’s not late! I never thought I’d see you again, and in such a form!” Sun Mengru’s eyes gleamed with happiness.

Recalling her past, Sun Mengru was now the combination of Chen Yunting and Sun Meng, possessing both their memories.

“I’m sorry I misunderstood you!” Luo Tian’s eyes glistened with tears, having paid a great price for years. Finally, he spoke the long-anticipated apology.

Countless nights had haunted him like a demon, waking in fear. Today, his wish was fulfilled—saying what he had long wished to say.

“I don’t blame you!” Sun Mengru’s face bore happiness, feeling she was the happiest person. Who could achieve what Luo Tian had?

“Those two truly endured much!” Nan Gong Yuqing, knowing some of Luo Tian’s past, bore a sigh of admiration, his gaze filled with blessings.

Luo Tian and Sun Mengru embraced each other, making people reluctant to disturb them—feeling they were a perfect match.

“Hmph!” Yet, a cold sound broke this serenity. Sun Miechen stood there with a grim face, his eyes filled with killing intent—unconcealed, like a child whose toy had been taken.

“Luo Tian! Come fight!” Sun Miechen, filled with killing intent, called to Luo Tian. His aura surged violently.

“Wait for me! I’ll kill him!” Luo Tian released Sun Mengru, adjusting her disheveled hair with a hint of joy, as if speaking about something trivial.

“Be careful!” Sun Mengru’s eyes bore a hint of worry. Though she had never met Sun Miechen, her body sense told her he was strong.

“Today, I’ll kill gods who block me and Buddhas who hinder me! No one can stop me—no one!” Luo Tian’s voice was resolute, gazing at the Divine King.

After speaking, Luo Tian extended his hand, and two streaks of emerald fire surged into Sun Mengru and Sun Hexi’s bodies.

“Come then! I’ll test your strength, the prodigy hidden by the Divine Clan!” Luo Tian’s aura brimmed with battle intent. He habitually summoned his Cracked Heaven Spear.

“Reincarnation Body! My first battle is against a Reincarnation Body—this is quite exciting!” Sun Miechen’s eyes gleamed with fervor. A golden sword appeared in his hand.

“Woo…” Luo Tian slowly sheathed the Cracked Heaven Spear, knowing it was no longer sufficient. His fists alone could withstand a saint-level weapon.

“Kill!” The two figures, like human tigers, surged forward with whirlwinds of wind, charging at each other.

FAD

Chapter 1116: The Divine King’s Intervention

On the Divine Clan’s sacred mountain, two golden lights collided. Lightning swords slashed across the sky as Sun Miechen wielded a golden sword, striking toward Luo Tian. His eyes bore intense killing intent as he rushed to Luo Tian’s side in an instant.

Luo Tian, like an undefeated warrior, sheathed the Cracked Heaven Spear and launched a golden fist. His fist could pierce through heaven itself, facing Sun Miechen’s high-grade golden sword without fear. The power of the Dao spread around him.

“Boom—” In an instant, they collided. Strange phenomena erupted; the sky above the Divine Clan cracked repeatedly under their clash.

They retreated, Sun Miechen gazing at his golden sword with cracks on it, his eyes gleaming with excitement.

“Indeed, the Reincarnation Body is formidable! I’ll see if your flesh and blood are stronger than mine!” Sun Miechen sheathed his golden sword, then soared into the sky again toward Luo Tian.

“Are they going to fight with their flesh and blood?” The people’s eyes gleamed with excitement. Who in the Nine Realms did not know Luo Tian’s name? He had never lost a battle.

Sun Miechen was equally formidable, the Eternal Immortal Body ranked just below the Reincarnation Body. As the Divine King’s son, he had been hidden for years, accumulating power to a terrifying degree. This era’s emergence would make him a true ruler.

“The Reincarnation Body and the Eternal Immortal Body—both renowned for their flesh and blood strength. This might be their first clash!” Yan Xiuluo’s face bore admiration as he murmured.

Other domain masters also wore excitement, eager to witness such a legendary clash. Even for their ranks, it was significant.

Nine Body Types—how often did one appear? Now, several had emerged, proving this era’s uniqueness.

“Kill!” As people murmured, Luo Tian and Sun Miechen clashed repeatedly.

Both radiated golden light, like warriors clad in gold armor. They punched each other relentlessly, and with every collision, the sky cracked violently. Tremendous fluctuations radiated from their clash, making low-level sect disciples feel suffocated.

The Dao’s Binding Magic—Luo Tian had mastered it perfectly, his punches constantly unleashed. As he understood more of the Dao’s power, his Binding Magic Punch grew stronger. Combined with the Buddha-Devouring Attack and the Dao’s Binding Magic, it could annihilate a saint-level late-stage opponent.

Sun Miechen, however, remained fearless, using the Divine King’s Regeneration Technique to heal his body. Even if injured, he recovered instantly without hesitation.

They clashed endlessly, each using their full strength—dangerous yet with some restraint, seeking an opportunity to deliver a fatal blow.

Even so, cracks formed on their bodies. The Divine King’s Regeneration Technique was miraculous, but its healing speed was limited. Luo Tian’s attack speed was terrifying; the regeneration could not keep up with his assaults.

“Fearsome! I never expected the Reincarnation Body to be so formidable!” Sun Miechen, having been sealed for years, was unaccustomed to this battle. Facing Luo Tian, the reigning prodigy of the Nine Realms, he had no respite.

“Opportunity!” Luo Tian noticed Sun Miechen’s momentary distraction, his eyes flashing with light. He seized the chance and unleashed a Binding Magic Punch.

“Force to the extreme! One force overcomes all!” Luo Tian roared, finally seizing his chance. He combined the Buddha-Devouring Attack and the Dao’s Binding Magic into one punch—the strongest he had ever delivered.

“Woo…” A hum echoed, and the fist pierced through space, instantly striking Sun Miechen’s chest.

Sun Miechen’s face turned pale; he knew he could not dodge Luo Tian’s overwhelming punch. He bit his teeth and did not retreat, choosing to exchange injury for injury, life for life.

“Eternal Immortal Punch!” As Luo Tian’s Binding Magic Punch touched Sun Miechen’s chest, Sun Miechen also unleashed his powerful punch.

However, due to the haste, Sun Miechen’s fist struck Luo Tian’s shoulder instead of his vital point.

“Boom—” Another explosion echoed as the people watched in tension. Sun Miechen’s body exploded into a mist of blood, floating in the sky.

Luo Tian’s entire shoulder was also shattered by Sun Miechen’s punch, blood misting and his body uncontrollably retreating.

“Has the victor been decided?” The people’s faces bore shock, gazing at Sun Miechen’s blood mist.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness, ignoring his severe shoulder wound. With one hand remaining, he extended it, and Dao seals surged forth, enveloping Sun Miechen’s blood mist.

“Eternal Immortal Body! Divine King Regeneration Technique!” Just as the Dao seals left Luo Tian’s hand, a deep roar echoed in the sky.

In an instant, the blood mist coalesced into Sun Miechen’s form, his aura still formidable and his cultivation unchanged.

“The Eternal Immortal Body combined with my Divine Clan’s Regeneration Technique—this is a perfect match. No matter how severe the injury, even if death were to come, it would recover instantly and never lose!” The Divine King Sun Shengtian smiled as he addressed the domain masters.

“Terrifying! Your son, the Eternal Immortal Body, is truly terrifying!” Yan Hongtao and others bore fear, imagining how terrifying Sun Miechen would be when he reached their level.

“I am an immortal and unkillable being. No one can kill me!” Sun Miechen’s eyes gleamed with joy, his hands moving swiftly. He knew that in flesh and blood strength, he was no match for Luo Tian.

“Divine King’s Nine Heavens Diagram!” Sun Miechen murmured, and the Nine Heavens Diagram flew from his hands. A powerful pressure instantly swept over Luo Tian’s mind.

“The Divine Clan’s Three Sacred Arts—Divine King’s Nine Heavens Diagram.” Luo Tian’s eyes bore deep concern. He had previously witnessed Sun Mengru use it in the Ancient Heaven Palace, achieving four major continents’ power. It had left him awestruck.

Now, with Sun Miechen wielding it, its power surpassed that of when Sun Mengru had used it at the early saint-level stage. It was three levels stronger, generating seven major continents’ pressure—enough to trouble even Luo Tian.

“Is it the Divine King’s Nine Heavens Diagram!” Among the onlookers were saint-level masters. Seeing the diagram in the sky, their faces bore shock; they could sense that Sun Miechen’s Nine Heavens Diagram posed a threat to them.

“Luo Tian is at a disadvantage. Though he’s strong, his martial arts are still lacking.” Yan Hongtao furrowed his brows, gazing at Luo Tian to see what method he would use to counter the Divine King’s Nine Heavens Diagram.

“Enter the Demon Realm!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice filled with endless coldness. Sacred power oceans reversed, and black demonic energy surged forth, eventually rushing into Luo Tian’s body.

“Reversal Seven Demon Blades!” Luo Tian’s black hair flew, like a demon king. His eyes flashed with cold light. Now at saint-level late-stage, his Reversal Seven Demon Blades were unleashed, their power reaching terrifying levels.

Black blades surged forth, enhanced by the Buddha-Devouring Attack and Dao power, their might earth-shattering. They sliced through the sky instantly colliding with the Divine King’s Nine Heavens Diagram.
