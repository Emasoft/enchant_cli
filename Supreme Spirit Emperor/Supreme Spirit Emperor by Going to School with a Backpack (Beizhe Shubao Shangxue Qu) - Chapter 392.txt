“Young man, be careful. This is the Annihilation Cataclysm. You must emerge quickly!” Long Xiao’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, as waves of displacement force struck Luo Tian’s body.

Luo Tian had no time to ponder, swiftly retrieving the Seven Star Trembling Demon Cauldron and vanishing from the room, appearing atop a mountain peak.

Black storm clouds obscured the sky, brewing an ominous strike that pressed heavily upon Luo Tian’s spirit.

“Annihilation Cataclysm?” Luo Tian murmured in his heart, the term unfamiliar to him. He turned toward Long Xiao, who floated beside him.

“The herbal formula was never meant to exist; it defied the Dao’s will, akin to a cosmic calamity. Though there is a sliver of chance, it remains exceedingly slim.”

“If the elixir can withstand this trial, then it deserves to persist. But if it cannot endure, future attempts will become exponentially more difficult,” Long Xiao said, his expression tinged with sorrow as he gazed at Luo Tian.

As Long Xiao’s words faded, a crimson light emerged from the storm clouds, rising slowly yet radiating apocalyptic power.

Chapter 1553: Annihilation Cataclysm

The crimson light surged with immense power, causing Luo Tian’s brows to furrow. His gaze fell upon an unassuming hut nearby—his former site for crafting the Reverse Blood Pill.

“If you survive this Annihilation Cataclysm, your formula will be deemed complete,” Long Xiao murmured, his eyes alight with anticipation. These days, he had sensed the uniqueness of Luo Tian’s elixirs.

After all, Long Xiao himself had once created a herbal formula of Sage-Grade High Rank. He understood the Annihilation Cataclysm well.

“Hum…” As Long Xiao’s words faded, a blood-red light shot forth from the storm clouds, instantly penetrating the room where Luo Tian had previously stood.

No explosion or tremors followed—nothing seemed to have occurred—but an oppressive atmosphere lingered in the air.

“How is it going?” Luo Tian’s face bore anxiety; this elixir had consumed nearly a year of his effort. He could not bear to lose it.

From Long Xiao’s explanation, Luo Tian knew that if his Reverse Blood Pill failed this trial, subsequent attempts would face far greater trials. Yet, if it endured, future elixir trials would mirror those of a standard Sage-Grade Intermediate.

As Luo Tian and Long Xiao waited anxiously, an hour passed. The suffocating pressure gradually dissipated, and the dark clouds overhead slowly receded.

“Has it ended?” Luo Tian’s heart leapt as he turned to Long Xiao, his expression filled with anticipation. He could not yet enter the room for the inheritance.

“Let’s go in and see. I wish to know if your elixir succeeded,” Long Xiao said softly, then waved his hand. The two vanished from the spot and appeared in the room where Luo Tian had crafted the elixir.

As they entered, golden light flooded their vision, accompanied by a formidable aura that resonated within their senses.

Amidst the golden glow stood a pill resembling a blazing sun, suspended in midair. Luo Tian and Long Xiao exchanged joyous glances.

“It succeeded!” Luo Tian laughed aloud, leaping forward to grasp the pill and placing it before Long Xiao.

“Master, has I passed the third trial?” Luo Tian smiled, then etched his compiled herbal formula and its effects onto a jade slip before presenting it to Long Xiao’s spectral form.

“Reverse Blood Pill, Sage-Grade Intermediate. Upon consumption, it unleashes one’s potential, enhancing the user’s strength—how much depends on their innate power and blood energy.”

“However, its aftereffects are equally severe. After consumption, the user will regress to an ordinary being for seven days, regaining one rank daily until reaching their peak.” Long Xiao’s eyes widened as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“To craft a Sage-Grade Intermediate elixir within a year is already astonishing. Your Reverse Blood Pill stands among the rarest of Sage-Grade Intermediate elixirs! Your alchemical mastery rivals even my prime!” Long Xiao sighed in admiration.

“Indeed, the younger generation surpasses the old,” he continued. “You have passed the third trial and earned my inheritance.”

“But now, could you explain why I cannot craft an immortal elixir?” Long Xiao asked, clearly intrigued by Luo Tian’s earlier words.

“You lack the heart of a true master,” Luo Tian replied softly, his gaze meeting Long Xiao’s.

“Though I am human, I have long allied with the dragon clan. Yet you repeatedly obstructed me.”

“Alchemy is the Dao; it demands inclusivity, like merged medicinal liquids. Yet your fixation on my identity reveals a lack of tolerance.”

“Master, consider this: when Fire Lord Meng Yixian took you as a disciple, did he care about your dragon lineage?” Luo Tian persisted, his words causing Long Xiao’s spectral form to tremble.

“Master…” Luo Tian watched the trembling figure, his voice hushed in fear of its dissolution.

“You are right. My heart was insufficient. For years, I obsessed with alchemy but neglected inner cultivation.”

“Master Meng Yixian never questioned my lineage. He accepted me without bias, teaching me as he did his other disciples.” Long Xiao sighed softly, a bitter smile on his face.

“Thank you for your guidance! Though I have perished, I still appreciate your help.” Long Xiao bowed to Luo Tian, a faint smile in his eyes.

“Truly, convincing an old immortal is rewarding—more so than persuading a battle-hardened warrior,” Luo Tian mused, smiling inwardly. He had merely guessed; he knew nothing of how Meng Yixian had taken Long Xiao as a disciple.

“You need not be polite, Master. Your alchemical mastery is unparalleled in my life,” Luo Tian returned the bow, adding a compliment he truly meant. Long Xiao’s alchemical prowess was unmatched in his experience.

“Enough. You have passed the third trial; now claim my entire inheritance,” Long Xiao waved his hand, and a green storage ring flew toward Luo Tian.

“This ring holds my life’s wealth—numerous herbs, including Sage-Grade treasures.”

“It also contains my decades of alchemical insights and some elixirs I crafted over the years. I do not know how many remain.”

“Of course, it holds countless formulas—my own creations,” Long Xiao continued, introducing the ring’s contents.

“This is true treasure!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly. The wealth of a master on the brink of crafting an immortal elixir was unimaginable.

“Boom…” A thunderous sound echoed as a crimson cauldron appeared before Luo Tian, radiating intense heat.

“This was my alchemical cauldron, forged by my Master based on his own. Though not a cosmic relic, it surpasses pseudo-cosmic relics,” Long Xiao said, nostalgia in his voice.

“Tianji Flame Dragon Cauldron—crafted from foreign divine iron. Like spatial treasures, it was my graduation gift, accompanying me through life,” Long Xiao explained.

Luo Tian’s face lit up with joy. Though he still used the Seven Star Trembling Demon Cauldron, he had not forgotten it was borrowed from Shen Gongfu.

This Tianji Flame Dragon Cauldron surpassed the Seven Star in quality and was crafted by Fire Lord Meng Yixian—perfect for Luo Tian’s tastes.

“Additionally, I have one crucial matter: my insights into crafting an immortal elixir,” Long Xiao smiled, then leapt forward.

“Hum…” The next moment, Long Xiao’s spectral form surged into Luo Tian’s body, and a vision filled Luo Tian’s mind.

In the image, Long Xiao stood atop a mountain peak, his expression resolute. The Tianji Flame Dragon Cauldron loomed beside him, and he radiated unwavering confidence.

“I, Long Xiao, shall craft the ultimate immortal elixir!” he declared, his voice fervent. He waved his hand, and crimson flames erupted from it, plunging into the cauldron.

Numerous herbs flew from his hands into the cauldron, and Luo Tian sensed Long Xiao’s speed surpassed even his own.

“Crafting an immortal elixir!” Luo Tian’s face paled, finally understanding the most precious part of this inheritance: Long Xiao’s process of crafting an immortal elixir.

Numerous rare herbs emerged from Long Xiao’s hands—nine hundred and ninety-nine in total, including many Sage-Grade treasures. Among them, Luo Tian recognized three immortal herbs’ essences, causing him to gasp in awe at Long Xiao’s wealth.

“Hum…” Within half an hour, Long Xiao extracted the medicinal essences, and a powerful hum resonated within the cauldron, as if refining nine hundred and ninety-nine dragons.

Luo Tian marveled at Long Xiao’s alchemical prowess while carefully observing the vision, knowing this might be his only chance.

Thunderous echoes filled the scene as Long Xiao repeatedly refined the elixir, dedicating his life to this endeavor.

Nine hundred and ninety-nine essences were gradually merged, and Long Xiao’s aged face bore sweat, yet his expression was fervent.

“The final essence…” Long Xiao laughed aloud, his body trembling as he fused the last elixir.

“Roar…” A roar echoed from the Tianji Flame Dragon Cauldron, intensifying Long Xiao’s excitement.

But as he rejoiced, radiant light surged from the sky, a formidable pressure descending upon him. A beam of immortal energy descended from the heavens, piercing into the cauldron.

Chapter 1554: Departing the Dragon Tomb

“That is immortal energy!” Luo Tian’s face shifted slightly. He recognized this light—having once absorbed remnants of an immortal elixir, his dantian held three threads of immortal energy.

Yet he had only called them “immortal energy” before, unsure if they truly belonged to the immortal realm.

But now, witnessing Long Xiao’s elixir drawing in this immortal light, he confirmed that the remnants of the elixir he and others had consumed were indeed immortal.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian marveled, Long Xiao’s expression darkened in the vision. The immortal light had exceeded his expectations.

“Absorb it!” Yet Long Xiao, a master of alchemy, remained composed despite the unexpected turn.

“Immortal energy has descended—this confirms my formula is correct!” Long Xiao roared, spitting blood into the cauldron.

As his blood entered, the Tianji Flame Dragon Cauldron calmed, but before he could catch his breath, another beam of immortal energy struck the cauldron.

The hum returned with greater ferocity, and even Long Xiao, a cosmic peak master, broke into cold sweat.

Yet he seemed entranced, his eyes wild with madness. A drop of heart’s blood emerged from him, rushing into the cauldron.

“If I can craft this immortal elixir, even death is no matter!” Long Xiao roared, and the cauldron stilled.

But fate refused to grant Long Xiao his triumph. A third beam of immortal energy descended, plunging into the cauldron.

The third wave overwhelmed Long Xiao, leaving him desperate. His state was at its limit; fusing two immortal energies had already pushed his limits. After all, immortal energy could even wound a pseudo-cosmic master. That Long Xiao achieved this was proof of his unparalleled talent.

“Hum…” After the third beam entered, Long Xiao could no longer control himself, his madness giving way to clarity.

“Damn it!” His face paled as he growled, attempting to flee but too late. A terrifying power erupted from the cauldron, annihilating everything in its path.

Destruction and apocalypse raged across the nameless continent where Long Xiao had crafted his elixir, obliterating it and himself in the explosion.

When dragon clan warriors arrived, only the Tianji Flame Dragon Cauldron hovered in space, and Long Xiao’s residual soul was sealed within it. The dragon clan took him to their tomb, preserving his soul in a special manner.

Luo Tian sighed deeply; he now understood how difficult it was to craft an immortal elixir. Perhaps only when he reached the cosmic peak would he succeed.

Three beams of immortal energy fused with countless Sage-Grade herbs—this explosion could destroy a pseudo-cosmic master. Though Luo Tian was at the cosmic peak, his body strong, he doubted he could withstand such an explosion when reaching a pseudo-cosmic master.

“Young man, your talent is remarkable. I hope you complete my unfinished task—craft an immortal elixir,” Long Xiao’s voice grew faint, his purpose fulfilled. He had found a worthy heir to pass on the memory of crafting an immortal elixir.

“I will do my best,” Luo Tian sighed, knowing Long Xiao would vanish forever.

“Don’t disappoint me,” Long Xiao’s voice faded, and the great alchemy master vanished.

Luo Tian gazed with admiration, retrieving the Tianji Flame Dragon Cauldron and issuing hand signs to seal the unassuming hut.

“Thank you, Master. When I have the strength, I will craft an immortal elixir and present it at your tomb,” Luo Tian murmured.

He then entered the storage ring, his expression shifting in awe. Within it lay countless jade boxes—each containing alchemical formulas and Sage-Grade elixirs.

“Every high-grade alchemist is a mobile treasure trove,” Luo Tian mused, scanning for the Dragon Mist Ice.

“I found it!” He grasped a jade box, though sealed, its touch sent a chill through him.

He opened it, and icy mist burst forth, obscuring his vision. Amid the fog, he saw a translucent dragon-shaped ice—Dragon Mist Ice.

“At last!” Luo Tian exhaled, vanishing from the mountain peak and appearing at Long Xiao’s tomb.

“Luo Tian…” As he emerged, Cao Dezu and others’ voices echoed in his ears.

They sought power enhancements, unlike Luo Tian’s complex path. Their progress was swifter.

“Everyone is here?” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Sun Mengru and Cao Dezu.

“You’ve gained much benefit, I assume?” Luo Tian asked softly. He had spent nearly two years in the dragon tomb, an unexpected duration. Yet it was worthwhile; his alchemy skills were now among the nine domains’ best.

“They returned half a year ago,” Long Jie chuckled, accustomed to the dragon tomb. He wandered briefly before waiting for Luo Tian.

“Where is Yao Chen?” Luo Tian asked softly, not seeing Yao Chen.

“He’s had a good time these past two years, challenging pseudo-cosmic masters’ tombs in the depths,” Cao Dezu smiled.

“Master Cao isn’t here either? No issues?” Luo Tian thought of Cao Yuanshan, his expression hopeful.

“Indeed, I visited Master Cao’s secluded chamber during your inheritance. He’s currently unavailable but claims progress toward a pseudo-cosmic master,” Long Jie said, his voice tinged with excitement.

“Hmph! I wonder who’d dare bother me once my grandfather becomes a pseudo-cosmic master!” Cao Dezu boasted.

“…You really are impressive,” Yan Jun muttered, eyeing Cao Dezu with disdain.

“Enough, let’s go,” Luo Tian said, sensing the two about to argue. He had spent two years in the demon realm, exceeding his expectations.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian’s words faded, thunderous sounds echoed from the tomb’s depths, causing their expressions to shift.

“Hah! I’m not playing anymore!” A golden light flashed, and Yao Chen transformed into a monkey-like form, his eyes blazing with gold.

“Yao Chen, leave!” Long Jie glared at him, anger in his gaze.

“I’m not leaving! This place is great. I’ll stay until I’ve traversed all pseudo-cosmic masters’ tombs!”

“Are you leaving?” Yao Chen asked Long Jie, his face content.

“You should go!” Long Jie’s expression darkened, his gaze unkind.

“What’s wrong?” The others looked puzzled; they remembered Yao Chen had initially wished to stay in the tomb, and Long Jie had agreed.

“You don’t know that this monkey destroyed two pseudo-cosmic masters’ tombs in these past two years!” Long Jie sighed, his gaze at Yao Chen turning fierce.

The tombs of pseudo-cosmic masters were crucial to the demon realm, each a rare treasure. In two years, Yao Chen had ruined two—had it not been for his lineage as the son of a cosmic master, Long Jie might have fought him. If Yao Chen stayed longer, the tomb might be overturned entirely.

“Truly a troublemaker!” Luo Tian felt regret for letting Yao Chen visit the Four Sacred Star Domains.

“I’m not leaving! If I go, who’ll keep me company? This place is better!” Yao Chen scoffed, then turned back into the tomb’s depths.

“Old Long, come on! Uncle Monkey is back—let’s fight three hundred rounds!” Yao Chen called as he walked.

“Yao Chen, follow my elder brother. He’s never lacked opponents!” Long Jie sighed, resorting to Luo Tian.

“Huh?” Hearing Long Jie’s words, Yao Chen paused, his golden eyes scanning Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian, let’s fight?” Yao Chen shouted, clearly interested in Luo Tian.

“Monkey, don’t always want to fight my elder brother. When you beat me, then he’ll step in. I can’t even beat him—how dare you fight my elder brother?” Chen Zhanbao interjected, stepping forward with a booming voice.

Chapter 1555: Entering the Divine and Demon Realm

“I don’t want to fight. Fighting with you is fun, but it’s too intense!” Yao Chen shook his head, still eyeing Luo Tian.

“Stupid kid!” Luo Tian glared at Long Jie, blaming him for this trouble.

“I don’t have time; I’ll fight you after finishing my tasks!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing Long Jie: “Let’s go.”

“You’re not fighting?” Yao Chen waved his hand, and a black staff reappeared in his grasp. His eyes burned with battle intent toward Luo Tian.

“Don’t provoke my elder brother!” Chen Zhanbao stepped forward, his eyes cautious as he watched Yao Chen.

“Let’s go first; you really want to tear the tomb apart?” Long Jie sighed, pulling out a dragon-shaped token. His hands emitted runes that wrapped the token, sending waves of energy around Luo Tian and others.

Instantly, their forms vanished from the tomb, appearing before two dragon statues.

As they materialized, several dragon clan elders emerged outside the tomb, their faces anxious as they gazed at Long Jie.

“Dragon Emperor, what’s happening? Why were two pseudo-cosmic masters’ tombs destroyed?” The elders asked, confusion in their eyes.

“Uh…” Long Jie’s face faltered as he glanced at Yao Chen, who stood beside him with an awkward expression.

“Ask him!” Long Jie pointed at the elders, his eyes conveying understanding.

“This…” The dragon elders looked at Yao Chen and immediately understood. Their beards bristled with anger, but they said nothing.

“This monkey must be the least favored among cosmic masters and ancient kings,” Luo Tian mused.

“Haha… it was an accident, just two pseudo-cosmic masters’ tombs. Don’t take it so seriously; I’ve gained them!” Yao Chen laughed, scratching his yellow hair.

“Two pseudo-cosmic masters’ tombs…” The elders roared, their gazes on Yao Chen.

“We have only eight pseudo-cosmic masters’ tombs in total. You’ve destroyed two, and they can’t be restored—completely lost!” The elders’ faces bore sorrow as they gazed at Yao Chen.

“Alright, when I become a pseudo-cosmic master, I’ll bring you two royal clan pseudo-kings!” Yao Chen, though awkward, showed no sign of embarrassment.

“Luo Tian, did you obtain what you wanted?” The elders knew arguing with Yao Chen was futile. They calmed their tempers and turned to Luo Tian.

“Thank you, elders! I have indeed received Master Long Xiao’s inheritance!” Luo Tian bowed to the elders.

“Really obtained it?” The elders, though prepared for this, had their lips twitch. Long Xiao’s wealth was well-known to the dragon clan; now Luo Tian possessed it, meaning all of Long Xiao’s life savings were in his hands.

“Congratulations…” The elders’ hearts ached as they had expected Luo Tian to gain Long Xiao’s inheritance. Yet the monkey’s destruction of two tombs added to their pain.

“Haha, elders, Master Long Xiao’s inheritance does contain what I need. But I remember the dragon clan’s kindness. This is Master Long Xiao’s storage ring!” Luo Tian waved his hand, sending the ring to their hands. Yet he took what he needed; the ring now held only a pile of herbs.

“This…” The elders’ faces shifted slightly, their bodies trembling as they felt the jade boxes of herbs within. Their eyes lit with joy.

“Thank you!” The elders smiled, knowing Luo Tian did this for Long Jie’s sake.

“I’ll take my leave today; I’ve stayed too long in the demon realm, exceeding my expectations!” Luo Tian bowed to the elders and patted Long Jie’s shoulder.

“Elder brother, I’ll follow you!” Long Jie’s face bore sorrow, wanting to accompany Luo Tian.

“Improve your strength in the demon realm; future battles await us!” Luo Tian shook his head, refusing Long Jie’s company.

“Luo Tian, we’ll follow you!” Cao Dezu and Yan Jun glanced at Yao Chen, not wanting to be trapped by him in the demon realm. They rushed to Luo Tian.

“Good!” Luo Tian didn’t object, as their strength was evident.

“I’ll go too! Staying in the demon realm is too boring!” As Luo Tian agreed, Yao Chen spoke up, also joining.

“Ah… that’s great!” The elders’ faces lit with joy upon hearing Yao Chen’s words.

“Go, go! As a cosmic master’s heir, you should battle with the nine domains’ elites!” The elders nodded in agreement.

“Trouble for you, Luo Tian!” The elders didn’t give Luo Tian a chance to refuse, persistently speaking.

“Alright… fine…” Luo Tian sighed, sensing the elders’ pleading gazes. He felt that having Yao Chen along would bring much trouble.

Under the elders’ joyous glances, Luo Tian and others flew out of the demon realm’s capital city, accompanied by Yao Chen, Cao Dezu, and Yan Jun.

“I don’t want to go!” As they flew out of the city, Cao Dezu and Yan Jun regretted it. Yet Yao Chen had coerced them into coming.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian smiled, and they flew toward the Divine and Demon Realm’s entrance. Without a transport array, reaching the Shura Domain required passing through the Divine and Demon Realm.

“Yao Chen left!” As they flew a short distance, cheers erupted from the demon realm’s capital city, echoing through its skies.

“Haha! Finally gone! I haven’t dared to go out for years!”

“Yes, the city will return to its former liveliness!”

“Plague has left? Plague has gone!” Cheers echoed.

“Did you see? My prestige here is so high; everyone misses me!” Yao Chen smiled, scratching his head.

Hearing Yao Chen’s self-congratulatory words, Luo Tian and others grimaced. They called him a plague, yet he boasted like this.

“You’re shameless… I thought Cao Dezu was the most shameless, but now…” Yan Jun muttered, not finishing his sentence.

“Rubbish! When did I ever act shamelessly?” Cao Dezu immediately retorted.

“Little ant, who’s shameless? I’ll beat you!” Yao Chen brandished his staff and swung it toward Yan Jun.

“Monkey, I’ll help you!” Cao Dezu immediately perked up and lunged at Yan Jun.

They bickered all day, eventually entering the Divine and Demon Realm, leaving Luo Tian in awe.

“Divine and Demon Realm, I’ll conquer you!” As they entered the demon realm, Yao Chen roared, his body radiating battle intent.

“How about it, Luo Tian? Want to check on Nan Gong’s kid?” Cao Dezu smiled, ignoring Yao Chen’s yelling.

“Let it be,” Luo Tian glanced at Yao Chen’s wild behavior, shaking his head. If Yao Chen sought out Nan Gong Yuching, he might stir up trouble.

Luo Tian sighed at Yao Chen’s antics; originally, it would take half a day to exit the demon realm but had stretched into a full day. Along the way, Yao Chen encountered several seemingly strong individuals and sealed his cultivation to challenge them.

Yao Chen was a cosmic peak master—such a being’s challenge would not be refused. Yet all those he faced left with bruises and swelling.

“Let’s go directly to the Shura Domain!” Luo Tian sighed, watching Yao Chen intercept others. He moved toward the Shura Domain.

“Huh? A strong one is coming this way!” As Luo Tian and others moved, Yao Chen’s eyes glowed with gold, piercing through space.

“Monkey, don’t talk nonsense. Are you itching for a fight again?” Cao Dezu sneered but wrinkled his nose.

“Huh, someone is coming—his scent is familiar!” Cao Dezu frowned slightly, confusion in his eyes.

As Cao Dezu’s words faded, a long rainbow streaked across the sky toward the entrance of the demon realm.

The figure seemed unaware of Luo Tian and others, heading straight for the demon realm.

“Stop!” Yao Chen’s eyes glowed with gold as he bared his teeth, and his black staff surged forward. It expanded rapidly, stirring the stars as it swung toward the streak.

“Don’t harm him!” As Yao Chen attacked, Luo Tian’s voice echoed through the stars. His brows furrowed slightly.

“Don’t worry!” Yao Chen smiled confidently, striking the streak with his staff.

The flying figure hadn’t expected an attack and couldn’t stop, frowning as he saw Luo Tian’s group. His eyes lit with joy.

Chapter 1556: Chaos

The black staff struck the figure’s body, causing it to curse and plummet toward Luo Tian’s group.

Luo Tian waved his hand, a white hand catching the figure and placing it before them. They recognized the figure, their brows furrowing slightly.

“Ren Hongzhe?” Cao Dezu and others murmured, confusion at encountering an old acquaintance here.

Yet Ren Hongzhe was in disarray, his body riddled with wounds and his clothes tattered like a beggar.

“Luo Tian!” Ren Hongzhe sighed in relief upon seeing him, catching his breath. He took the elixir Luo Tian offered without hesitation.

“How did you end up here? And so disheveled?” Cao Dezu asked, confusion at Ren Hongzhe’s injuries.

Luo Tian and others had previously rescued Li Tianzhi and Ren Hongzhe from the Thunder Sea Marsh, then instructed them to unify the Thunder Domain. However, the ancient tribes arrived too quickly. They used a cosmic relic to take the Snow Dragon Mountain and sent its people to the Four Sacred Star Domains before heading to the Demon Realm to find Nan Gong Yuching, staying with the demon clan.

“Kid, I thought you’d be thriving in the Divine and Demon Realm. Instead, you’re this pitiful!” Cao Dezu smiled, offering Ren Hongzhe his help.

“Rubbish! I was betrayed!” Ren Hongzhe retorted, hatred in his eyes.

“Betrayed?” Luo Tian and others furrowed their brows, sensing the gravity of Ren Hongzhe’s situation. His progress had been astonishing—reaching cosmic peak. Who could betray him to such a state?

“Who betrayed you?” Luo Tian frowned, sensing something serious.

“Don’t know.”
