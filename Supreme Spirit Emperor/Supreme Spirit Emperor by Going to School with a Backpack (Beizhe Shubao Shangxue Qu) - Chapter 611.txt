"Qianxue, I'm telling you, every corner of Jiutian City has delicious food. The most famous is 'Butterfly in a Plate.' Want to try it? After we finish, we can go on an excursion through Jiutian Mountain. I've heard it's a blessed land that aids cultivation and has breathtaking scenery!" Fu Bei extended the invitation, making Gu Qianxue feel somewhat unaccustomed.

"Son of a bitch!" Luo Tian followed behind the two, hearing Fu Bei's words and mentally cursing him.

"Handsome bastard! Stop right there!" As Fu Bei kept speaking, Luo Tian finally couldn't hold back and barked at Fu Bei, taking a step forward to block his path.

Fu Bei and Gu Qianxue both paused slightly, their gazes turning toward Luo Tian's imposing figure with rugged features and a face full of coarse muscles.

"Handsome bastard! Last time at our place, you found three girls and didn't pay, letting you escape. Pay up now!" Luo Tian spoke coldly.

"Uh? Are you talking about me?" Fu Bei looked left and right, noticing no one around him. He was confused as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"What are you staring at? I'm talking about you, handsome bastard! Do you think those girls from our place are so easily deceived?" Luo Tian spoke with disdain.

"I don't understand what you're saying!" Fu Bei's eyes showed confusion. He secretly sighed, recalling that he always paid when going to such places and had never owed money. Moreover, with Gu Qianxue by his side, Fu Bei couldn't admit it. Even if there was truth to it, he wouldn't acknowledge it, fearing it would damage his image in Gu Qianxue's eyes.

Gu Qianxue halted her movement, gazing at Luo Tian through the black veil. This made Luo Tian feel uncomfortable, sensing something was off.

"Damn it! Either give me the money or I'll break one of your legs. Choose!" Luo Tian cursed loudly, his voice filled with anger as he stepped forward and grabbed Fu Bei's collar.

"Although Luo Tian's appearance seems quite intimidating, to Fu Bei he was just a small thug with no combat power. Naturally, he didn't dodge. 'You're asking for death!'" Fu Bei sneered and grabbed Luo Tian's wrist, but his expression immediately changed upon contact. However, when Luo Tian grabbed him by the collar, Fu Bei also caught Luo Tian's wrist, attempting to push him away.

"Fall down!" Luo Tian exerted his strength, lifting Fu Bei and turning to perform a shoulder throw, sending Fu Bei crashing into the ground.

"Thud..." A heavy sound echoed. Fu Bei was smashed into the earth, instantly creating a large pit with flying stones.

"What's going on?" Passersby gathered around, faces filled with confusion.

"You..." Fu Bei was lifted again by Luo Tian. The previous strike had stunned Fu Bei, who hadn't expected this seemingly流氓-like giant to be a powerhouse.

"What do you mean? Give me the money quickly!" Luo Tian lifted Fu Bei again, throwing him to the ground once more. However, this time a patch of black clouds caught Fu Bei's body. Gu Qianxue extended her hand, and a black flying sword shot out, rushing toward Luo Tian. Luo Tian swiftly turned around and grabbed the hilt of the black sword with his hand, gazing at Gu Qianxue.

"This is our matter. A woman should stay out of it. If you interfere further, I'll fight you too!" Luo Tian spoke coldly, his jealousy intensifying. He took a step forward and rushed toward Fu Bei who had just been thrown.

"You're asking for death!" Fu Bei roared, feeling embarrassed. His eyes flashed with madness as he waved a golden long spear into his hand.

"Whirr..." Fu Bei held the spear with both hands, appearing before Luo Tian and slashing downward toward him.

Chapter 2309: All Gathered()

"Finishing with the girls without paying, then beating me!" Luo Tian muttered as he saw the golden spear rushing toward him. He extended a fist.

"Thud..." The demonic energy was concealed by the thousand-illusion mask. Luo Tian's thick fist collided with the long spear's handle, causing Fu Bei's golden spear to fly out of his hands.

Using the Yellow Spring Step, Luo Tian moved like lightning before Fu Bei's face. He stepped forward and unleashed the Heavenly Human Dao Method, causing Fu Bei to freeze momentarily. This momentary pause was enough for Luo Tian to stomp Fu Bei under his foot, the sound of a crack echoing from Fu Bei's chest. The cold demonic sword pointed at Fu Bei.

"Don't move, or I'll cut you!" Luo Tian shouted loudly, making Fu Bei's face pale.

"Fu Bei was subdued by that big man!" The crowd gasped, watching Fu Bei trampled under Luo Tian's foot.

This all happened in an instant. Even Gu Qianxue hadn't reacted, and by the time she did, Fu Bei was already lying there.

"Death!" Gu Qianxue sneered and suddenly unleashed her black ghost sword. The ghostly qi surged, splitting the black sword into a long black dragon that rushed toward Luo Tian. Seeing the black dragon, Luo Tian remained calm. He grabbed Fu Bei and held him in front of himself, stopping the black sword dragon abruptly.

"I..." Fu Bei was stunned. He hadn't expected this big man to be so strong, having no ability to resist at all. Seeing the black sword nearly piercing him, Fu Bei was terrified. If it had advanced a little more, his life would have been lost.

"Big brother, I'll give you the money already!" Fu Bei immediately softened, addressing Luo Tian. He had no strength to fight, so he could only submit.

"That's better!" Luo Tian didn't hesitate. He snatched Fu Bei's storage ring, erased its mark, and took it.

"Big brother, I don't know where you're from. Leave your name!" Fu Bei knew he had met trouble today, clearly someone was after him.

"My name isn't something you need to know. I'll tell you this: next time you find girls, remember to pay!" Luo Tian sneered and gazed at Gu Qianxue.

"Miss, this handsome bastard isn't worth it. He's no good. I advise you to be careful; people who can't pay their debts have poor character," Luo Tian spoke to Gu Qianxue, then put the ring away and walked away. Gu Qianxue watched Luo Tian leave, her eyes filled with disdain. Two dark glows flickered beneath the veil, and she smiled coldly.

After this incident, Fu Bei and Gu Qianxue naturally had no desire to go anywhere else. Gu Qianxue supported Fu Bei as they walked toward the city governor's mansion.

"Ah, Fu Xiong, what happened to you?" As they just arrived at the city governor's mansion entrance, Luo Tian's figure appeared in Fu Bei and Gu Qianxue's sight.

"Son of a bitch!" Luo Tian saw Fu Bei's hand on Gu Qianxue's shoulder and mentally cursed. He quickly approached the two, saying nothing and pulling Fu Bei in front of himself.

"Ugh..."

"Luo Xiong, be gentle. I'm seriously injured!" Fu Bei mentally cursed Luo Tian for meddling but smiled on his face.

"What happened? Who did this to Fu Xiong? If I find out, I'll definitely avenge him!" Luo Tian spoke with anger.

"Encountered some trouble. I was tricked!" Fu Bei's face showed a bitter smile. He had originally thought he could get closer to Gu Qianxue, at least seeing one of the top ten immortal beauties in the celestial realm. But who knew a strange thing would suddenly appear.

"Ah, Fu Xiong with such strength was tricked. But why?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, speaking as if serious.

"Ah... I don't know. Please, Luo Xiong, help me in!" Fu Bei sighed deeply.

"Is Miss Gu Qianxue alright?" Then Luo Tian turned to Gu Qianxue, speaking with concern. Gu Qianxue only sneered and walked toward her residence without responding to Luo Tian. As Luo Tian heard Fu Bei's thanks, he helped him into his residence and walked out with a smile, feeling quite relieved.

As Luo Tian was somewhat triumphant, a black ghostly figure appeared before him, sending cold chills down his spine.

"Unexpectedly, you're such a despicable person!" The icy voice made Luo Tian shiver. He gazed at Gu Qianxue, who was wrapped in ghostly qi.

"You think you did it perfectly? Fu Bei considered you a friend, but you treated him like this. You're the most despicable person I've met. What's your intention?" Gu Qianxue spoke coldly, her icy gaze through the veil also making Luo Tian feel cold.

"I..." Luo Tian had no words. Obviously, Gu Qianxue had recognized everything he did but hadn't exposed it yet.

"Something's wrong..." Luo Tian felt Gu Qianxue's disdain. Although she had lost her memory and become another person, she still retained some of her old habits.

Luo Tian saw Gu Qianxue clenching her fists tightly. He knew she hated him and despised him deeply, which was not what Luo Tian wanted to see.

"I won't tell Fu Bei about this. But I hope you take care of yourself!" Gu Qianxue sneered and walked past Luo Tian, leaving him stunned.

"I did this for you!" Luo Tian mentally shouted but didn't show it. He knew the more he explained, the more Gu Qianxue would resent him. A strange emotion rose in Luo Tian's heart, although he knew Gu Qianxue was like this because she didn't recognize him. Still, Luo Tian felt very uncomfortable.

With a look of loneliness, Luo Tian returned to his room. As soon as he entered, his breathing became heavy and he struggled to catch his breath. After a full quarter of an hour, Luo Tian finally recovered and muttered, "What should I do?" This was the first time Luo Tian felt defeated. However, his eyes soon showed cruelty: "My wife will never allow anyone else to touch her! Even if I have to kill him!"

For the next two days, Luo Tian didn't go out. Fu Bei also spent his time recovering. Jie Du seemed to be in meditation within his room, remaining calm. On the third day, Zhou Zhiwen sent someone to invite Luo Tian and others. Luo Tian knew that the two people Zhou Zhiwen had invited must have arrived.

In the grand hall with a powerful atmosphere, Luo Tian and others sat there. Gu Qianxue still maintained her cold demeanor. Fu Bei had also recovered and was sitting beside Gu Qianxue, constantly speaking to her with great enthusiasm, as if forgetting the previous embarrassment.

Luo Tian sat there, watching Fu Bei's insidious actions but didn't act. He knew if he made any more moves, it would only make Gu Qianxue resent him further.

"I'll endure!" Luo Tian repeatedly comforted himself, pouring wine into his mouth constantly.

"Monk, you seem to have inner troubles. Have you encountered a spiritual demon? I have a set of Clear Mind Sutra; you can recite it every morning to eliminate spiritual demons," Jie Du noticed Luo Tian's state and transmitted his thoughts.

Luo Tian had no desire to respond to Jie Du at the moment. He kept staring at Gu Qianxue, drinking wine constantly and waiting for Zhou Zhiwen's two additional people to arrive. Meanwhile, Zhou Zhiwen noticed the strange atmosphere in the hall and understood it after seeing Fu Bei's enthusiasm around Gu Qianxue. He pitied Luo Tian and then lowered his head to think.

After a quarter of an hour, a figure walked into the hall. Dressed in green robes and with jet-black hair shining, as soon as he appeared, Zhou Zhiwen's face showed a smile.

"Welcome, Brother Yin!" Zhou Zhiwen stood up and approached the young man, addressing him.

"Brother Zhou invited me; how could I not come?" The youth smiled and, under Zhou Zhiwen's guidance, sat down.

"Brother Zhou, did I arrive late?" Just as the youth sat down, a hoarse voice echoed in people's ears. A gray figure silently appeared outside the hall.

"Brother Hun didn't arrive late!" Zhou Zhiwen smiled and stood up again, leading the figure wrapped in gray clothes into the seat.

"No one is normal..." Luo Tian looked at these people sitting here and felt somewhat speechless.

He was a demon cultivator, Jie Du was a monk, Gu Qianxue was a ghost cultivator. The previous youth seemed relatively normal but Luo Tian sensed the aroma of medicinal herbs on him and a sense of arrogance. This aura was very familiar to Luo Tian, it was the aura of an alchemist. Fu Bei was a handsome bastard; this person wrapped in gray clothes, Luo Tian guessed he must be a soul cultivator.

"Brother Yin from the Medicine King Mountain. Brother Hun, a genius disciple of the Heaven Soul Mountain..." Zhou Zhiwen introduced to Luo Tian and others. He then introduced Luo Tian and the two others.

"From the Heaven-Heaven Mountain?" Yin looked at Luo Tian, his eyes showing hostility, making Luo Tian feel confused.

"You really make me dislike you without knowing why!" Hun's gaze was also on Luo Tian, his voice hoarse, making Luo Tian uncomfortable. Luo Tian naturally knew why Hun looked at him with discomfort; after all, he had another identity as a Soul-Subduing Master, which was somewhat of a restriction against soul cultivators.

"Haha, everyone is here. Let's have a small gathering tonight and rest for the night. Tomorrow we'll depart to the Mirage Mountain," Zhou Zhiwen laughed.

"A small gathering is enough. I want to see everyone's strength and whether they are worthy of accompanying me!" Zhou Zhiwen's words had just finished when Hun immediately spoke with battle intent, extending his hand and attacking Gu Qianxue.

Chapter 2310: Exclusion()

Hun's attack surprised everyone in the hall. In an instant, a gray hand rushed toward Gu Qianxue, making Luo Tian react immediately.

"Whirr..." Luo Tian's eyes showed icy coldness. However, he was far from Gu Qianxue and couldn't move immediately. He could only use the Heavenly Human Dao Method and the压制 power of the Soul-Subduing Master against soul cultivators.

"Hmm?" Hun's face slightly changed, his body momentarily pausing. However, only Hun felt the powerful pressure.

"Qianxue, be careful!" Fu Bei's eyes flashed with intense light. At that moment, he was closest to Gu Qianxue and instantly appeared in front of her.

Gu Qianxue's reaction was quick. She also extended a palm, striking the gray hand with a thunderous sound.

"Thud... Thud..." Two heavy sounds echoed. Gu Qianxue and Hun both struck Fu Bei's body.

Blood spewed from Fu Bei's mouth, his entire body collapsing to the ground. His gaze showed weakness.

"You..." Gu Qianxue's heart trembled, watching Fu Bei lying on the ground in a weakened state. She hadn't expected Fu Bei to suddenly appear.

"Qianxue, I'm fine. I won't let you be in danger!" Fu Bei's eyes showed tenderness, gazing at Gu Qianxue with deep feelings.

"Since I first met you, I've loved you. Even if I had to die for you, I would have no regrets!" Fu Bei spoke tenderly, gazing at Gu Qianxue.

"I..." Gu Qianxue looked at Fu Bei, her heart being touched by a string she couldn't explain.

"Dammit, it's a套路!" Luo Tian watched Fu Bei's fake death-like state and mentally cursed. He also noticed the light in Fu Bei's eyes, while Hun stood there without continuing his attack.

"Those two know each other!" Luo Tian mentally cursed, realizing that Hun and Fu Bei had a brief moment of eye contact.

"Green grassy plains are your home!" The voice of the Heaven-Heaven Stone echoed in Luo Tian's mind, making his forehead veins pulse.

The previous strike from Hun would have seriously injured Gu Qianxue if it had hit her. Obviously, Hun and Fu Bei knew that only a real attack could deceive Gu Qianxue. Killing intent brewed in Luo Tian's eyes. He didn't know how many people Fu Bei had used this trick on, but using it against Gu Qianxue had angered Luo Tian.

"Qianxue, may I see your face?" Fu Bei's face showed tenderness as he spoke to Gu Qianxue, extending his hand toward the black veil.

"Come on, show me your strength. Attack sneakily!" As Fu Bei's hand was about to touch the black veil, Luo Tian shouted loudly, his voice like thunder, causing the hall to tremble.

"Whirr..." Luo Tian's body moved like lightning. The Heavenly Human Dao Method and the power of the Soul-Subduing Master were instantly unleashed, pressing a powerful pressure on Hun.

"You!" Hun's face changed dramatically. He immediately realized the pressure from before and tried to escape, but in an instant, a black demon shadow with cold eyes filled with killing intent was imprinted into Hun's pupils.

"Whirr..." A black fist pressed down, breaking the void. Filled with Luo Tian's overwhelming anger, four fists converged and struck Hun's chest.

"Crack..." A clear sound echoed in the hall. Hun spat blood, his chest caved in. His eyes showed disbelief as he gazed at Luo Tian standing there before being thrown back.

"Boom..." The entire hall trembled. Hun's body was pressed against the hall.

"Woah!" Yin's eyes showed shock, watching Luo Tian as a demon. He hadn't expected the elder of the Heaven-Heaven Mountain to be so strong. His regret was evident, as he had previously held some hostility toward Luo Tian.

The Medicine King Mountain was almost entirely alchemists, becoming one of the nine immortal mountains due to their status as a medicinal arts sanctuary. However, the Medicine King Mountain had a disgrace: Jiang Yuanxiong of the Heaven-Heaven Mountain was known as the number one alchemist in the immortal realm. Therefore, people from the Medicine King Mountain had no good feelings toward disciples and elders of the Heaven-Heaven Mountain, even harboring some hostility.

"Treacherous person!" Luo Tian flew forward. His eyes showed more intense killing intent. The aura of the Dragon's Abyss Sword and the demonic energy within his body had taken advantage of Luo Tian's momentary loss of control, beginning to infiltrate his mind.

"Luo Monks, it seems you're about to fall into the demon path!" Jie Du's face showed concern. His hands struck a wooden fish, and his body radiated waves of light. Invisible fluctuations spread from Jie Du's body toward Luo Tian.

"Ah..." Luo Tian roared, being enveloped by the Buddha light. His eyes showed a touch of pain as he gazed at Jie Du.

"Monk, don't recite anymore. Don't make me regret it!" Luo Tian spoke coldly and rushed toward Jie Du.

"Everyone, stop him!" Zhou Zhiwen shouted, watching Luo Tian's wild state. His hands emitted waves of energy, and a golden mountain flew from his hands toward Luo Tian.

"Get out... I'm not crazy..." As Luo Tian stood beside Jie Du, he saw the golden mountain above him and extended a palm.

"Boom..." The golden mountain turned into waves of energy, shattering above Luo Tian's head. Luo Tian stood there, his robes fluttering. He gazed at Hun.

"Are you okay?" Gu Qianxue extended her hand, and a black medicinal pill fell into Fu Bei's mouth.

"Cough... Cough..." Luo Tian spat out two mouths of black blood. He looked at Fu Bei's triumphant expression, his killing intent increasing.

"Boom..." The hall trembled again. Luo Tian, like a wounded beast, rushed toward Fu Bei.

At this moment, Luo Tian didn't care anymore. He couldn't watch his wife be gradually taken by others in this way.

"Kill Fu Bei, and the matter will be over!" Luo Tian's mind had only one thought: kill Fu Bei, even if it meant Gu Qianxue would hate him. Luo Tian rarely had such a moment, but when it came to his most beloved person, he was completely mad. Even if there were consequences he couldn't bear.

"Boom..." In an instant, Luo Tian appeared before Fu Bei, who was already severely injured. He punched toward the lying Fu Bei.

"Get out..." However, Luo Tian had forgotten that Gu Qianxue was still by Fu Bei's side. Previously, Fu Bei had saved Gu Qianxue, and there was the incident with the Nirvana Flower. Gu Qianxue naturally felt touched and wouldn't let Fu Bei be killed by Luo Tian.

"Luo Xiong, what are you doing!" Zhou Zhiwen shouted, watching Luo Tian's wild state.

"Om mani padme hum!" Jie Du recited a mantra, his body radiating holy light. He appeared before Luo Tian.

At the same time, Gu Qianxue also stood by Fu Bei's side. Her cold gaze was directed at Luo Tian, and her white hands wrapped in black qi struck toward Luo Tian without hesitation.

"Thud... Thud..." Two heavy sounds echoed. Luo Tian's body retreated, and Jie Du also spat blood before flying back.

Blood spewed from Luo Tian's mouth. He had just received a solid strike from Gu Qianxue. Although he could have completely blocked it, Luo Tian couldn't bear to hurt Gu Qianxue.

"Luo Xiong, what's your intention? Why did you attack me?" Fu Bei showed a weak expression, gazing at the blood-spitting Luo Tian.

"Despicable person. That big man on the street was him. He doesn't know when to stop!" Gu Qianxue spoke coldly, making Fu Bei's face slightly change.

"Luo Tian, we have no grudge. I treated you as a friend. Why did you attack me?" Fu Bei's face darkened, seemingly realizing something and understanding why Luo Tian had attacked him.

"Why did I attack you? Don't you know?" Luo Tian spoke coldly, his eyes fixed on Fu Bei.

"Because of Qianxue?" Fu Bei understood. He had previously felt Luo Tian's interest in Gu Qianxue, but hadn't expected Luo Tian to be so mad. He had first injured Fu Bei and now wanted to kill him.

"Luo Xiong, let's talk calmly. You are both guests I invited. I can't watch you be harmed!" Zhou Zhiwen spoke, and a group of figures rushed into the hall.

"Master!" The Eight Shades of Darkness immediately stood around Luo Tian, cautiously watching Zhou Zhiwen and others.

"Little Master!" More figures appeared. Two more early-stage immortal kings entered the hall, standing by Zhou Zhiwen.

"Monk, the sea of suffering is endless. Turn back before it's too late!" Jie Du spoke while spitting blood, his body radiating waves of energy. Others also gazed at Luo Tian.

"Luo Tian, this isn't over. I Fu Bei will remember this!" Fu Bei's face darkened as he shouted at Luo Tian.

"It's indeed not over. Now I'll kill you!" Luo Tian spoke coldly and took a step forward, rushing toward Fu Bei again.

"Only you?" Gu Qianxue stood in front of Fu Bei, her hands moving. Black ghostly figures appeared behind her and rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Ah..." Luo Tian was at his wit's end, watching the black ghostly figures. He suddenly stopped and gazed at Gu Qianxue, allowing the black ghosts to bite him.

"Crack..." The black ghostly figures bit Luo Tian's body, and blood flowed from his body. This ghost was extremely powerful because it differed from Gu Qianxue's usual conjured ghosts; it was a soul of her own blood. If Luo Tian injured this ghost, Gu Qianxue would also be harmed.

Luo Tian stepped back. He gazed at Gu Qianxue, unsure of what to say. His heart was bleeding.

"Brother Zhou, this person is so crazy. If he joins us on the journey to the Heart Demon Elder's cave, I'm afraid it would be dangerous. If he joins us, I definitely won't go in!" Hun's hoarse voice echoed, his eyes filled with killing intent as he gazed at Luo Tian.

Chapter 2311: Mirage Mountain()

"This..." Hearing Hun's words, Zhou Zhiwen was stunned. He hadn't expected Hun to say such a thing. Luo Tian's combat power, which Zhou Zhiwen had just seen, was the strongest among them. Such a formidable combat power was very necessary for Zhou Zhiwen. Additionally, he knew Luo Tian could plant the demon seed of the Dao, and in the Heart Demon Elder's cave, it might have a miraculous effect. However, Hun, Gu Qianxue and others were chosen by Zhou Zhiwen because they were special, each coming from one of the nine immortal mountains.

"I also don't think this person is suitable to go with us. Without me, there's no him!" Fu Bei spoke coldly, gazing at Luo Tian with a glint of killing intent.

"I also agree!" Gu Qianxue spoke softly, gazing at Zhou Zhiwen. Yin remained silent, obviously maintaining neutrality.

"Monks, it's better to be merciful. This monk's actions were unintentional!" Jie Du spoke to everyone, being the only one who supported Luo Tian.

Luo Tian gazed at Gu Qianxue, his heart feeling like it was being cut. He also looked at Fu Bei and Hun, his killing intent surging. However, he knew that he had missed the best opportunity to kill them earlier. Now it was impossible because those two early-stage immortal kings stood by Zhou Zhiwen's side and wouldn't let him kill Fu Bei and Hun.

"Alright!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, gazing at Zhou Zhiwen. If Zhou Zhiwen didn't let him stay, he had no choice. But Luo Tian wouldn't give up; he would secretly follow Gu Qianxue and it would be easier to act in secret. He had already planned to completely eliminate Fu Bei and Hun.

Zhou Zhiwen's eyes showed contemplation, weighing the pros and cons. Finally, he looked at Luo Tian with regret: "Luo Xiong, I hope you don't hold it against me. You are my friend, Zhou Zhiwen, but for this journey to the Heart Demon Elder's cave, I hope you withdraw!"

"Good!" Luo Tian had already prepared himself and didn't refuse. Although he didn't consider these three important, they were more significant to Zhou Zhiwen than the three of them combined.

"Take care of yourself!"

"But as long as I'm here, no one will harm you!" Luo Tian didn't respond to others. He deeply gazed at Gu Qianxue, spoke to her, and seemed to be talking to himself. He led the Eight Shades of Darkness out of the hall, his background looking unusually desolate.

Watching Luo Tian's desolate back and that deep gaze before leaving, Gu Qianxue's body slightly trembled. A vague figure appeared in her mind. This figure often appeared in Gu Qianxue's dreams but had never revealed its true form.

"I need to find another body quickly and merge with it. That should allow me to reach the early-stage immortal king level!" Gu Qianxue muttered internally. Luo Tian's strength made her uncomfortable.

"I won't let this go. He attacked me without reason!" Fu Bei spoke, watching Luo Tian's departing figure. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

Hun's gaze was also icy, but thinking of Luo Tian's previous strength, a hint of fear surfaced in his heart.

"Alas... When will this cycle of hatred end? Monks, your hearts need to be broader!" Jie Du spoke softly. Fu Bei and Hun felt speechless. The three of them had been injured by the mad Luo Tian, yet now Jie Du spoke like this.

"Alright everyone, rest. Once your injuries heal, we'll depart!" Zhou Zhiwen sighed deeply, not expecting the situation to turn out this way. He stepped out of the hall.

Luo Tian had no face left in the city governor's mansion. Although Zhou Zhiwen hadn't kicked him out, Luo Tian had no choice but to leave the city governor's mansion because he planned to secretly monitor Fu Bei's every move. As soon as he left the city governor's mansion, Luo Tian led the Eight Shades of Darkness to a inn and arranged for them. He then summoned the Heaven-Heaven Stone again, heading back toward the city governor's mansion.

Soon, one person and one stone returned to the city governor's mansion. The Heaven-Heaven Stone floated gently into Fu Bei's room.

"Rest well," Gu Qianxue sighed and waved to a purple-cloaked attendant, handing her three medicinal pills.

"These three pills, give one each at morning, noon, and night. If you neglect it, I won't forgive you!" Gu Qianxue spoke to the purple-cloaked attendant.

"Yes!" The purple-cloaked attendant felt Gu Qianxue's cold aura and quickly nodded in agreement.

"Miss Gu, are you leaving?" Fu Bei lay in bed, watching Gu Qianxue leave after giving instructions. He spoke weakly.

"Wait until your injuries heal," Gu Qianxue lightly shook her head and stepped out of the door.

Luo Tian saw all this, although it hurt, he couldn't help but watch.

"Master, how did you get so injured?" The purple-cloaked attendant saw Gu Qianxue leave and approached Fu Bei's bed, looking at him.

"It's not too serious..." Fu Bei raised his hand to rub his forehead and then opened his eyes.

"Give me a massage!" Fu Bei spoke to the purple-cloaked attendant, his voice carrying some impatience.

"Master was pursuing that lady just now. Although I couldn't see her face, she must be a beautiful beauty. Master isn't going to abandon me for that lady, right?" The purple-cloaked attendant started unfastening Fu Bei's clothes and spoke continuously.

"Ugh..." Fu Bei muttered softly, watching the purple-cloaked attendant: "Don't worry. Once I get her, I won't forget you. I'll take you as my concubine!"

"Really?" The purple-cloaked attendant's eyes brightened slightly, and she worked harder.

"Son of a bitch!" Luo Tian watched Fu Bei lying in bed and the attendant working tirelessly, mentally cursing. He also took out a crystal ball to record their actions.

However, as soon as Luo Tian picked up the crystal ball, a long scream echoed in his ears, making him speechless.

"This... was too fast..." Luo Tian felt speechless watching Fu Bei. He hadn't expected Fu Bei to be so weak, only a little while...

"Master is getting stronger!" The purple-cloaked attendant's eyes briefly showed contempt, then spoke vaguely.

"Ah, go on. Master needs to rest. Once I recover, I'll have a good time with you..." Fu Bei spoke satisfiedly to the purple-cloaked attendant. The purple-cloaked attendant put on her clothes, bowed slightly, and left the room. Now only Fu Bei remained in the room, with Luo Tian hiding in the shadows.

"Truly... I thought it would be interesting. This Heaven-Heaven Stone's effort was wasted!" The Heaven-Heaven Stone spoke impatiently in Luo Tian's ear.

"Although the time was short, those last few images were enough. Fu Bei, wait for me, I've never lost so much before!" Luo Tian mentally cursed and waited patiently. Although he really wanted to slap Fu Bei to death, he didn't. In Luo Tian's eyes, Fu Bei was already a dead man; it was just a matter of when he took his life.

Luo Tian wanted both Fu Bei's life and Gu Qianxue's heart. He needed an opportunity, a chance to turn things around. If Fu Bei attacked Gu Qianxue, Luo Tian wouldn't advise killing him early. At this moment, Luo Tian was in the shadows while Fu Bei was in the open; naturally, the advantage was with Luo Tian.

Time passed slowly. Three days later, Fu Bei's injuries gradually healed. During these three days, Gu Qianxue visited Fu Bei once a day. Although Fu Bei spoke eloquently, Gu Qianxue remained indifferent and cold, leaving Fu Bei unsure of what she was thinking. However, Luo Tian in the shadows felt somewhat anxious and almost couldn't resist killing Fu Bei but held back.

Two more days passed. Fu Bei, Hun, and the monk's injuries were all healed. Zhou Zhiwen's face showed joy as he gathered them together.

This time, their meeting was much smoother. Six people walked out of the city governor's mansion and quickly left Jiutian City, heading south. Luo Tian naturally followed them.

"Brother Zhou, don't worry. Even without that Lu person, with us, it's the same," Hun spoke to Zhou Zhiwen, his voice filled with confidence.

"Blessed monk, the truth is not spoken. Brother Hun's words are slightly off. Although Lu Tian has fallen into demon path, his strength is still formidable. I estimate that even if we all combined, perhaps we wouldn't be able to match Lu Tian's strength!" Jie Du spoke softly, making Hun's face slightly embarrassed.

"Qianxue, don't worry. After this Mirage Mountain journey ends, I'll strive to cultivate and definitely kill that Lu Tian!" Fu Bei constantly followed Gu Qianxue, speaking to her with great enthusiasm.

They flew for half a day and finally arrived at the Mirage Mountain, which Zhou Zhiwen had described. A vast mountain range appeared in their sight.

"Everyone, this is the Mirage Mountain. The Heart Demon Elder's cave is here in the Mirage Mountain. However, this is a natural illusion array. Therefore, we need to find it together!" Zhou Zhiwen introduced to everyone.

"Follow me closely. I have a fragment of the Mirage Mountain map, which will allow us to be more precise. However, whether we can find it depends on our luck. Remember this Mirage Mountain is extremely dangerous. I know everyone's skills are high, but there will be life-threatening dangers. Don't get lost!" Zhou Zhiwen gave a few instructions and led the way into the mountain range.

Luo Tian also followed behind everyone, rushing into the Mirage Mountain. He even had the Heaven-Heaven Stone attached to Gu Qianxue's body, fearing she might get lost.
