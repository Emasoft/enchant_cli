“Not even my grandfather knows about this! The matter is too significant to discuss with anyone else but you!” Diao Dezhu refused vehemently, transmitting his thoughts again to Luo Tian.

Chapter 951: What Will You Do?

Upon hearing Diao Dezhu’s words, Luo Tian realized the latter might indeed have something important. His expression shifted, and he extended his hand, releasing a surge of golden divine power that instantly restored Diao Dezhu’s battered appearance.

“Speak, then!” Luo Tian transmitted his thoughts, his voice laced with suspicion. The moment he considered his suspicions, a surge of excitement coursed through him.

Seeing the shock in Luo Tian’s eyes, Diao Dezhu displayed a flicker of pride. He rose to his feet, standing tall with an air of defiance as he gazed at Luo Tian. “Hmph! I’m going to give this golden paper to my grandfather. He’ll surely reward me greatly. I treated you as a brother, yet you beat me without reason!”

“Hmph…” Luo Tian’s heart swelled with exhilaration, his eyes wide with astonishment as he stared at Diao Dezhu.

Seeing the awe in Luo Tian’s gaze, Diao Dezhu’s expression turned triumphant. He stood up straighter, his eyes gleaming with self-importance. “Hmph! I’m going to my grandfather now!”

“Wait, no—Diao Brother!” Luo Tian’s face bore urgency as he grabbed Diao Dezhu, his expression carrying a hint of regret. He mentally cursed himself for having beaten the boy.

The onlookers exchanged puzzled glances, their eyes flicking between Luo Tian and Diao Dezhu. Initially, Luo Tian had assaulted Diao Dezhu without hesitation, but now it seemed the latter held the upper hand. Luo Tian appeared to be in the wrong.

As for Diao Dezhu’s mention of seeking his grandfather, no one questioned it. They simply assumed he was going to confront his grandfather for retribution after being beaten—a common occurrence, especially for Long Yongfu, who had long grown accustomed to such scenarios.

“What’s going on? I’m a bit confused. Who’s right and who’s wrong?” Gu Lei asked, his voice booming. Though he seemed to be addressing others, it was clearly directed at Luo Tian.

“Hmph! Nothing’s wrong. I don’t fight with people, but I let Luo Tian off easy! If I had truly fought him, that boy wouldn’t have stood a chance against me. Even the Saint-level middle-tier master from Shiluo Domain was no match for my skill!” Diao Dezhu’s face bore an air of arrogance as he lifted his head once more. He had now fully concluded that the golden page was crucial to Luo Tian.

“Indeed!” Upon hearing Diao Dezhu’s words, Luo Tian felt reassured. Though Diao Dezhu hadn’t explicitly named the Shiluo Domain’s powerful figure, Luo Tian knew it was Yan Hongtao, the Saint-level middle-tier master.

“Good brother!” Though Luo Tian didn’t know how Diao Dezhu had obtained the fragment of the Epoch Book, he could imagine how difficult it must have been for a half-Saint to retrieve it from a Saint-level middle-tier master—even one who had suffered heavy injuries.

“You really don’t use your brain. You just went at him head-on! Learn to think, okay, little Luo!” After confirming that Luo Tian wouldn’t challenge him, Diao Dezhu resumed his self-aggrandizing tone. He lightly tapped Luo Tian’s head with a condescending air.

Luo Tian’s expression stiffened, but recalling that Diao Dezhu had returned the Epoch Book fragment and his own prior beating of the boy, he wore a wry smile and nodded in agreement.

“Haha! Young man, learn from me in the future! Understand? Learn more from Uncle Diao! Without breaking a sweat, I—” Diao Dezhu’s face radiated pride. Seeing Luo Tian didn’t object, he continued boasting.

In no time, Diao Dezhu returned to his self-satisfied demeanor, forgetting the earlier resentment from being beaten. He gestured wildly, boasting loudly before the crowd.

Luo Tian nodded in agreement constantly, occasionally praising Diao Dezhu’s achievements. The onlookers were bewildered, watching Diao Dezhu boast and flatter himself.

After boasting for an hour, Diao Dezhu’s words flew like spittle. The crowd grew impatient.

“Enough!” Long Jie’s face turned ashen, watching Diao Dezhu’s self-satisfied demeanor. He could no longer endure it—especially seeing Diao Dezhu scold Luo Tian, who was his elder. However, since Luo Tian seemed to have willingly accepted it, Long Jie hadn’t intervened. Now, seeing Diao Dezhu show no signs of stopping, he finally interrupted.

Long Jie’s command caused Diao Dezhu to immediately cease. He feared Long Jie more than anyone else in his life, even more than his grandfather. Diao Dezhu knew Long Jie’s status within his grandfather’s heart was far greater than his own.

“Speak! What is it!” Long Jie’s face bore impatience as he barked at Diao Dezhu, nearly making Diao Dezhu speak out.

“Wan Xiong, please set up a formation to isolate this place!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with solemnity as he addressed Wan Lingkong, knowing his mastery of formations was unparalleled.

Seeing the gravity in Luo Tian’s eyes, Wan Lingkong understood there was something significant to say. He waved his hand, and the formation flags scattered, surrounding Luo Tian and others.

“This formation can block a Saint-level late-tier master’s detection!” Wan Lingkong smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

“Not enough! I need a formation that even a Saint-level peak master cannot detect!” Luo Tian shook his head, addressing Wan Lingkong.

“Hmph?” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the crowd’s brows furrowed slightly, their expressions shifting.

“Alright!” Wan Lingkong wore a bitter smile, his expression now solemn. His hands glowed with golden light as he launched more formation flags. This time, he took it seriously, soaring into the sky to carefully measure positions, placing each flag with meticulous care.

After an hour, Wan Lingkong finally descended from the sky. He tossed the last main formation flag into the air, and an invisible barrier enveloped them all.

“Wan Xiong’s mastery of formations is truly unparalleled in my life!” Luo Tian sighed with admiration. He hadn’t expected Wan Lingkong to actually create a formation that even a Saint-level peak master couldn’t detect.

Others also wore expressions of admiration. Though Wan Lingkong’s cultivation was merely Nine Source Celestial Sovereign, his formation mastery was undeniably among the best in the Nine Domains.

“Only blocking detection, though. My ancestor once set up a formation to trap a Saint-level peak master—now that was true mastery! I still have a long way to go!” Wan Lingkong wore a bitter smile, knowing the crowd had misunderstood.

“Enough. Speak now—there are no outsiders here!” Luo Tian’s face bore excitement as he addressed Diao Dezhu.

Diao Dezhu discarded his annoying demeanor, raising a brocade box. Golden light seeped from the gaps in the box.

“Is this—!” Everyone’s gaze was drawn to Diao Dezhu’s brocade box, their faces filled with shock.

They had all attended the auction. They knew this was the very box that had been taken by a Shiluo Domain master during the auction, humiliating the eight great demonic clans. Everything had revolved around the contents of this box.

Seeing their stunned expressions, Diao Dezhu’s face bore pride. He extended his hand and opened the box. Golden light surged forth, revealing a golden sheet of paper within it. Flowing inscriptions radiated an immense aura from the golden sheet.

“Indeed, the Epoch Book!” Luo Tian laughed aloud. He hadn’t survived nine deaths to obtain the Epoch Book, yet Diao Dezhu had. Luo Tian now found Diao Dezhu increasingly endearing, longing to kiss his face.

“Hmph! A mere Saint-level middle-tier master from Shiluo Domain—wasn’t I able to outwit him?!” Diao Dezhu’s face bore pride as he addressed the crowd.

Luo Tian didn’t question how Diao Dezhu had obtained the Epoch Book. As long as he had it, that was a great achievement in Luo Tian’s eyes.

Thinking of Yan Hongtao returning to Shiluo Domain and discovering he had wasted his efforts, Luo Tian could imagine the latter’s expression.

In truth, Yan Hongtao was far worse off than Luo Tian had imagined. In the Divine-Monster Domain, he was enduring a life-or-death battle, being hunted by the divine clan. He had fled for miles, still far from Shiluo Domain.

“Damn it! I told you the Epoch Book isn’t in my hands. You divine clan scum, when I return to Shiluo Domain, I’ll kill you all!” Yan Hongtao raged at the relentless divine clan warriors.

Yan Hongtao was on the verge of tears. He had just entered the Divine-Monster Domain, and things had been relatively smooth. He found a place to recover his injuries by about seventy percent, intending to glance at the Epoch Book. But when he retrieved it, he was stunned—his carefully preserved Epoch Book had vanished, and he didn’t even know when it disappeared.

Misfortune struck again. Yan Hongtao planned to return to Shiluo Domain first, but the divine clan had launched an assassination against him. They even calculated his position.

“Damn it! If I find out who stole my Epoch Book, I’ll skin them alive!” Yan Hongtao’s face bore a cruel expression. His pale complexion turned into a red streak, flying toward Shiluo Domain.

“Ah-choo!” Diao Dezhu’s boasting was interrupted by a sudden sneeze.

“Hmph, kid! I risked my life for you, fought a Saint-level middle-tier master, and finally stole the Epoch Book. You didn’t even let me explain before beating me! How do we settle this?!” Diao Dezhu sneered at Luo Tian.

“Then how do you want to settle it? You’ve grown up, haven’t you? What’s so important that you kept it from me?” Diao Dezhu’s words were cut short as a massive invisible hand slammed him to the ground. Diao Yuanshan’s figure appeared in their sight, his eyes filled with anger.

“Kid, you’ve really grown bold. How could you keep such a big secret from me!” Diao Yuanshan sneered, holding the golden Epoch Book.

“Grandfather…” Diao Dezhu hung his head. Even a formation that could block a Saint-level peak master had been discovered by his grandfather. His mind was certain he couldn’t boast before Luo Tian again—boasting had only led to another beating.

Luo Tian and the others wore awkward expressions, their gazes on Diao Yuanshan’s furious face. Their minds were shaken—Diao Yuanshan’s cultivation was astonishingly powerful, capable of detecting a formation that even a Saint-level peak master couldn’t. This meant Diao Yuanshan’s cultivation had surpassed the Saint-level peak.

“Don’t overthink it. I’m not yet a Epoch Master, just a step toward it. Achieving the Epoch Realm is so difficult. If Longzu hadn’t perished, there might have been a chance. Alas!” Diao Yuanshan sighed, finally turning his gaze to Long Jie.

“Do you want the fragment of the Epoch Book?” Diao Yuanshan didn’t dwell on this topic but instead scrutinized Luo Tian.

Luo Tian wore a wry smile, bowing respectfully. “Indeed, I do need this page of the Epoch Book. As for why, I can’t reveal it.”

Diao Yuanshan nodded slightly. After all, anyone who had reached the Saint-level had their secrets. Thus, he didn’t press further.

“The Nine Domains are about to erupt. Good! Since this boy obtained it, and you have a bloodline connection with Longzu—perhaps even a symbiotic one—the Epoch Book belongs to you without issue.”

“However, I hope you’ll protect Longzu’s safety in the future,” Diao Yuanshan said with a sigh.

Hearing Diao Yuanshan’s words, Luo Tian and the others were stunned. What was Diao Yuanshan’s cultivation? A step toward the Epoch Realm. How many in the Nine Domains had such a level? Such power would have made him a domain’s ruler in the past. Even Diao Yuanshan said he couldn’t guarantee Long Jie’s safety—clearly, he lacked confidence.

“Master, what exactly is going to happen in the Nine Domains?” Luo Tian asked, a sense of urgency rising within him.

“I have a feeling the Nether Domain will emerge. Legends say every time the Nether Nine Saints appear, it’s a massacre of corpses and chaos across the Nine Domains! This isn’t a secret among domain masters!”

“The Nether Nine Saints are called that because they’re all Saint-level peak. The last time they caused chaos, they were at the Saint-level peak. Though they were nearing their end, they had absorbed countless souls to prolong their lives. Their lifespans and cultivation were unaffected. Thus, no one knows how strong they’ve become over the years!” Diao Yuanshan’s face bore bitterness. He recalled Longzu’s battle against the Nether Nine Saints, when he himself was merely a Saint-level late-tier master, following Longzu.

After so many years, even he had reached the step toward the Epoch Realm. How much more so for those legendary Nether Nine Saints who had survived countless years.

Hearing Diao Yuanshan’s account, Luo Tian’s face shifted violently. He had thought the Nether Nine Saints were merely Saint-level peak, but now he realized his naivety. If he advanced, so did they. How terrifying their current strength must be—Luo Tian couldn’t even imagine.

Back then, Gu Tianshu had been at the Saint-level peak and was suppressed by Heaven. Even with that, Gu Tianshu had surpassed the Saint-level peak. How much more so for the Nether Nine Saints, who were naturally gifted?

“Looks like the old one I beat to death was the weakest among the Nether Nine Saints!” Luo Tian muttered inwardly. His previously relaxed mood snapped back into tension.

“Master, do you know when the Nether Nine Saints will emerge?” Luo Tian’s face bore solemnity as he asked Diao Yuanshan, wanting to know when the Nether Domain would appear.

“Don’t know. But it should be soon. Legends say before the Nether Nine Saints appear, the Nine Domains will plunge into chaos!”

“Currently, the Nine Domains are already showing signs of chaos. The emergence of the Ancient Palace has drawn all domain forces to the Demon Domain—this is a sign of chaos. Don’t even mention the conflicts within the Ancient Palace. Just consider these recent conflicts: you killed the head of Lei Domain’s representative sect, Leiming Sect. That sect won’t let it go easily!”

“Shiluo Domain has also provoked us. They caused a ruckus at the Demon Domain’s Holy City auction. The seven other clans’ elders have decided to mobilize the entire Demon Domain’s strength to attack Shiluo Domain. Though Shiluo Domain’s core city, Shiluo Holy City, is hard to find, with time it will be discovered. War is about to ignite!” Diao Yuanshan sighed as he spoke.

Hearing Diao Yuanshan’s words, the crowd’s hearts trembled. They hadn’t expected an ancient palace to have such far-reaching implications.

“When the Nine Domains erupt, that’s when the Nether Domain will emerge!” Diao Yuanshan sighed deeply and handed the Epoch Book to Luo Tian.

“I don’t know your secrets, but this Epoch Book holds great mysteries. If you unlock it, it might greatly enhance your strength. This book has existed in the Demon Domain for countless years, yet no one has deciphered it. Perhaps my beast clan’s wisdom is low, or perhaps the Epoch Book simply doesn’t suit our beast lineage!” Diao Yuanshan said and sighed deeply.

Luo Tian and the others fell silent. Beast clans had unique advantages, their bloodline power formidable. Generally, beasts could surpass human peers of the same level with their physical strength and long lifespans. However, their high-level combat power wasn’t as evident. Especially at the Saint-level, progress was arduous. Since Long Zhan Tian’s era, Diao Yuanshan had been the first to reach a step toward the Epoch Realm. This was due to his clan’s talent for finding treasures and receiving countless blessings.

“You desire the Inexorable Life-Death Bamboo. When you exit the Ancient Palace, I’ll take you there. With my current strength, I should be able to protect you!” Diao Yuanshan sighed, recalling the place where he had obtained the Inexorable Life-Death Bamboo.

“Demon Domain’s forbidden zone!” Luo Tian wore a grateful expression. He had given nothing, yet Diao Yuanshan had helped him without hesitation, even gifting the Epoch Book. Though Diao Yuanshan said that place could protect him, it was a place of great danger—perhaps even more perilous than the Ancient Palace. With his current strength, he would surely die.

“Yinlong Valley!” Diao Dezhu’s face turned solemn upon hearing his grandfather was taking Luo Tian to find the Inexorable Life-Death Bamboo. His eyes bore endless concern.

Hearing Diao Dezhu’s words, people’s faces changed. They had spent enough time in the Demon Domain to know of Yinlong Valley’s name.

“Exactly. That’s Yinlong Valley. Since the Demon Domain existed, it has been its greatest forbidden zone. Longzu himself perished there! I once explored Yinlong Valley to uncover the truth of Longzu’s demise. I discovered the Inexorable Life-Death Bamboo there. It was also in Yinlong Valley that I learned Longzu’s death had ties to the eight clans, even with the Dragon Clan!” Diao Yuanshan’s face bore a faint smile as he glanced at Long Yongfu and Jin Tianshu.

Long Yongfu and Jin Tianshu were stunned. They knew Diao Yuanshan had spoken these words in front of them, clearly not considering them outsiders.

“Master, rest assured. We’ll keep this secret!” They quickly spoke, vowing to never reveal it. Diao Yuanshan then turned his gaze away.

“Enough. These matters are too distant. Your current task is to enhance your strength, striving to the utmost. Otherwise, when the Nine Domains erupt, your loved ones will perish!” Diao Yuanshan surveyed Luo Tian and the others. Their talents were commendable, so he had spoken at length.

“Thank you, Master!” Luo Tian and the others respectfully nodded, their eyes filled with determination as they bowed to Diao Yuanshan.

“I’ll leave first. You can retrieve the barrier. This formation is indeed intriguing. Other clans’ elders probably won’t sense it!” Diao Yuanshan praised Wan Lingkong.

As Diao Yuanshan’s words ended, the entire Holy City trembled violently, as if an earthquake had occurred. Intense golden light illuminated the city, causing everyone to frown slightly.

Diao Yuanshan’s eyes narrowed. He gazed into the void and spoke softly: “The Ancient Palace has opened!”

Hearing Diao Yuanshan’s words, Luo Tian and the others’ brows twitched. They gazed into the void as a golden palace, radiating immense pressure, appeared outside the Holy City’s starry sky.

“Haha! Finally出来了. I’ve waited so long. I must survive the Ancient Palace and ascend to Saint-level!” A chorus of laughter echoed through the Holy City, followed by streams of light flying out toward the city’s exterior.

“Go. The Ancient Palace holds great treasures. I hope you remember something within it!” Diao Yuanshan gazed at Long Jie, addressing the group.

Chapter 952: The Saint’s Demise

Outside the Demon Domain’s Holy City, beneath endless starry skies, the entire cosmos trembled violently. Golden light illuminated the sky, and space fractured as a radiant palace emerged from the fissures. Though no one knew where it had come from, its overwhelming aura sent shivers through even Saint-level masters.

The palace was entirely golden, radiant and pure. Outside the palace, golden mist formed into roaring dragons circling it, amplifying its awe-inspiring presence.

“Buzz…” A wave of energy radiated from the palace, enveloping it in a golden barrier that made it appear more ethereal and sacred.

Not long after its emergence, streams of light arrived instantly. Figures gathered densely, surrounding the palace with countless people.

Though the palace was vast, spanning nearly ten thousand feet, the dense crowd completely surrounded it. Each person’s face bore reverence as they gazed at the sacred palace.

“Ancient Palace! This is the Ancient Palace. A few days ago, it briefly appeared in our Demon Domain. I never thought it would truly appear outside the Demon Domain’s Holy City!” A high-level beast of the Demon Domain, with a reverent expression, spoke.

“Yes. Whether it’s good or bad remains to be seen. The Ancient Palace is a tomb for Saints, infamous across the Nine Domains. Countless high-level masters have entered it, but few returned. Yet those who did would surely achieve greatness!” Others murmured, yet no one dared to rush into the legendary Ancient Palace immediately. Once inside, escaping was truly difficult.

The eight great demonic clans of the Demon Domain appeared first in people’s sight, causing surrounding beasts to revere them. The leader was Feng Clan’s patriarch, Feng Hongzhi.

“Alright, since the Ancient Palace has appeared, we won’t hinder you. If anyone wishes to enter, be our guest!” Feng Hongzhi smiled and addressed the crowd.

Among the eight great demonic clans, young generations also moved. Except for the Shadow-Devil Fox Clan, each clan had figures emerging from their respective clans—some at the half-Saint level, others at the Saint-level early stage. None were in the High-Level Beast realm. Feng Jiutian, Shi Hongtu, and Hu Xiangyang stood among these sixteen people. The rest were other clans’ prodigies and elders.

“Wow, the Demon Domain has so many people entering the Ancient Palace?” People marveled at the Demon Domain’s boldness, surprised by how many it had mobilized—sixteen people.

“Hmph. The Demon Domain is really confident. That’s the Ancient Palace, yet they’re willing to send these people to die!” As people marveled, another group appeared in their sight.

One black, one golden—two contrasting colors of attire, as if fire and water were incompatible. Yet they stood together: the divine clan and demon clan of the Divine-Monster Domain.

Compared to the Demon Domain, the divine and demon clans were more cautious. Behind Divine Saintess Sun Mengru stood two early-stage Saint elders, and two young figures. Sun Feiwen was also among them. Additionally, the demon clan’s saint son, a young man shrouded in black mist, stood among the two clans’ group.

“Haha! Fellow cultivators, you arrived quite early!” A loud laugh echoed. Starlight flickered as the Star-Scattering Domain’s people appeared, their faces smiling.

At the same time, lightning surged as the Thunder Domain’s people arrived. However, their expressions were grim. The death of Grandmaster Li Xingteng had deeply affected them.

People wore expressions of awe, watching the young people emerging from each domain and great clan. They were all the sons and daughters of major clans, their faces reflecting the determination of each family’s prodigies. They marveled at how each domain's major clan was willing to risk their young prodigies.

“I’ll remind all Saint-level early-stage and above masters first. Don’t force it. Even if you seal your cultivation to the Saint-level early stage, you still can’t enter this Ancient Palace. It will definitely kill you!” Feng Jiutian smiled and addressed the crowd, offering a kind warning.

Feng Hongzhi’s words had barely finished when several high-level Saint and middle-stage hermits frowned slightly, their faces solemn. Some quietly hid within the crowd.

“Haha! I refuse to accept it. Cultivators must embrace nine deaths and one life. I’ll see what this infamous Ancient Palace can do to me, preventing my ascent to the Epoch Realm!” Despite his arrogance, a hermit from the Divine-Monster Domain, with middle-stage Saint cultivation, laughed and rushed toward the Ancient Palace.

“Ah! It’s hermit Miao Deyi. I never thought he would come to the Demon Domain! The divine clan’s patriarch once tried to recruit him but failed. He’s always independent, preferring to seek opportunities in dangerous places. Besides the Divine-Monster Domain’s divine and demon palaces, he hasn’t entered any other dangerous zones. He’s truly a ruthless person!” The divine and demon clans of the Divine-Monster Domain immediately recognized him, their faces showing surprise as they watched Miao Deyi rush toward the Ancient Palace.

Though Miao Deyi’s words were arrogant, his years of entering dangerous zones had made him cautious. He hadn’t sealed his cultivation but instead exploded into a mist of blood, striking the Ancient Palace’s barrier.

The explosion of a middle-stage Saint was terrifying. A powerful roar echoed across the starry sky, shaking the Ancient Palace’s barrier three times but leaving it unscathed.

Blood slowly coalesced, and Miao Deyi reformed, his face pale. His cultivation dropped to the early-stage Saint level.

“Too ruthless! He sacrificed himself just to enter the Ancient Palace, causing his cultivation to drop!” People were stunned by Miao Deyi’s actions.

At the same time, Luo Tian and others appeared in the crowd. Seeing Miao Deyi’s actions, their faces bore intense shock.

“Hmph! This man is really ruthless. Few in the Nine Domains dare to be this harsh on themselves! No wonder he’s reached middle-stage Saint!” Gu Lei and others murmured, watching Miao Deyi’s drop in cultivation.

“Haha! My cultivation dropped to early-stage Saint. I’ll see if it still lets me in!” Miao Deyi laughed, his body surging forward with a fierce aura toward the Ancient Palace.

“Dropped cultivation? Can he enter?” People’s faces bore anticipation, watching Miao Deyi to see if this method was viable.

Under people’s expectant gazes, Miao Deyi reached the Ancient Palace’s barrier in an instant. Without hesitation, he rushed into it.

Suddenly, waves of energy radiated from the barrier. Golden light swept over Miao Deyi’s body as if scanning his cultivation.

At the same time, half of Miao Deyi’s body was engulfed by the barrier. People were startled, and Miao Deyi wore a triumphant expression.

“可行?” (Feasible?) People murmured, watching Miao Deyi who had entered the barrier halfway and wore a triumphant expression.

As people discussed, Miao Deyi’s body had four-thirds entered the barrier. People were stunned—self-explosion to enter the Ancient Palace was truly effective. Some hermits at the Saint-level middle-stage in the crowd felt a stir of desire, as they lacked resources compared to those in sects. They preferred this sense of self-reliance.

As people were stunned, the barrier outside the Ancient Palace emitted waves. Golden light illuminated the sky. Miao Deyi’s face was filled with disbelief as an invisible hand pulled him out, his eyes full of terror.

“No…” Miao Deyi roared, his body writhing in agony. His early-stage Saint cultivation, post-explosion, erupted violently, as if resisting something.

“Roar…” Golden dragons surged from the barrier, instantly wrapping around Miao Deyi and transforming into golden inscriptions that bound him.

“Boom…” Under people’s stunned gazes, Miao Deyi was destroyed within a breath. His soul and body were annihilated, blood mist spewing out and spreading across the golden barrier. The barrier absorbed it instantly.

People were stunned, then instinctively trembled. Their gazes turned to the golden sacred palace, their faces filled with disbelief.

“Within a breath, Miao Deyi was annihilated. Even self-explosion couldn’t save him!” People murmured, causing those at the Saint-level middle-stage to abandon their thoughts of entering the Ancient Palace.

“Not going in. No matter what, I’m not going in! It’s too terrifying!” Some High-Level Beasts and early-stage Saint people, who had planned to enter the Ancient Palace, now saw Miao Deyi’s death and the rumors of ten deaths for one life. They felt as if cold water had been poured over their heads. Before even entering, a middle-stage Saint had died—what terrifying thing was inside? No one could say.

Yet some still dared to enter, seeking opportunities before these sacred prodigies. They transformed into dragons and rushed toward the barrier.

However, no one at the early-stage Saint level or above dared. Miao Deyi’s bloody lesson was still fresh.

Waves continued to radiate, no longer as before. The massive barrier appeared calm like a still pond, with countless figures entering it without hindrance.

“We’re going too!” Feng Jiutian’s face bore a killing intent. He glanced at Luo Tian and others before rushing toward the barrier with two early-stage Saint elders from the Feng Clan.

Chapter 953: Don’t Go

In the Demon Domain’s Holy City, beneath starry skies, waves radiated from the Ancient Palace’s golden barrier. Countless figures rushed into it. The waves quickly subsided, as the Ancient Palace was a forbidden zone. Many were cautious, and within moments, only thousands had entered.

Thousands sounded like many, but compared to the Nine Domains’ massive population, it was nothing more than a fraction.

The barrier’s calmness left only the elites of each domain and great clan unentered. They exchanged glances, but aside from Star-Scattering Domain’s people, others bore hostility toward Luo Tian and his group.

Luo Tian rubbed his nose, scanning the crowd. He memorized their appearances, mentally scoffing: “With these people, you think you can harm me!”

“Hmph! Luo Tian, we’ve become the enemy of all!” Gu Lei and others smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

“An undefeated path for prodigies is like this—everyone against you. How could people like you understand?” Diao Dezhu crossed his arms, a lonely aura forming on his small frame. He gazed at Luo Tian as if they were confidants.

“Go away…” This self-aggrandizing behavior naturally earned them white eyes, but due to the crowd’s presence, they gave Diao Dezhu some face.

“Hmph! Luo Tian, think you’re strong. You have Diao Yuanshan protecting you outside the Ancient Palace. Once inside, do you think I can’t get you?” Feng Jiutian sneered and rushed toward the barrier with a early-stage Saint from the Feng Clan.

The demon clan’s people also bore endless hostility, scanning Luo Tian, Nan Gong Yuqing, and Wan Lingkong. They transformed into a black mist and rushed into the barrier.

The divine clan, due to Sun Hexi’s departure, now had a middle-stage Saint elder leading. However, a graceful figure stood at the front of the crowd. Even that middle-stage Saint elder wore respect, standing behind her.

“Luo Tian, you insulted us. Once inside the Ancient Palace, I’ll capture you and return you to the divine clan!” Sun Mengru’s face bore coldness as she gazed at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian had placed his spiritual sense on Sun Mengru since arriving. Seeing her gaze directed at him, he wore a smile and intended to respond, but upon seeing her cold eyes, his heart trembled.

“Divine clan. You scum must have said countless bad things about me. I need to find a chance to explain to Yunting, otherwise the misunderstanding will deepen—it’s not good!” Luo Tian gently looked at Sun Mengru before glaring coldly at the divine clan.

“Hmph! Whether you know me or not, I’ll make you suffer for offending the divine clan!” Sun Mengru sneered and rushed toward the barrier with Sun Feiwen.

“Haha! Brother Luo, be careful in the Ancient Palace!” Zhou Wei smiled, his eyes sparkling with wisdom. The Star-Scattering Domain’s people all shone with intelligence as they addressed Luo Tian.

“Star-Scattering Domain?” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly. He had briefly interacted with the Star-Scattering Domain during the auction. Because of items he had purchased, they had withdrawn from competition. He felt good about the Star-Scattering Domain’s people.

“Zhou Brother still needs your help!” Luo Tian smiled, as the other party had shown goodwill. He wouldn’t be aloof and bowed to the Star-Scattering Domain’s people.

“Ugh, I wonder why the Chaos Domain hasn’t arrived yet. It’s really annoying!” Zhou Wei looked around, his face showing disappointment.
