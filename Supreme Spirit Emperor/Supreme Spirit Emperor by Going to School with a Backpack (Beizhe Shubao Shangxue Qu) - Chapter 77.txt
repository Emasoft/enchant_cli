Under the concerned gazes of two people, Zheng Xin supported Jiang Nanxuan, who was weak, as they exited the bamboo hut.

With a gesture of reassurance to Leng Qiuchan and Meng Yao, Zheng Xin helped Jiang Nanxuan sit down, then recounted Luotian's situation to the two.

After listening to Zheng Xin's account, Leng Qiuchan's gaze carried an expectant expression as she looked toward the bamboo hut.

"Luotian, you cowardly turtle! Dare to come out? Hiding inside like a man?" Just as Leng Qiuchan and the others spoke, a series of curses echoed into their ears.

Chapter 377: Advancing to the Late Bone-Transformation Stage

Chapter 377: Advancing to the Late Bone-Transformation Stage

Outside the bamboo forest, Dongbo Yongsi and his companions wore expressions of helplessness. Behind them, over a hundred people's curses roared like thunder, crashing into the courtyard.

Hearing the shouting, Leng Qiuchan and the others furrowed their brows, gazing toward the bamboo forest.

Meng Yao's face bore a faint smile as she subtly moved her fingers, causing the bamboo forest to rustle again, muffling the sound outside.

"Who are these people?" Zheng Xin's face showed interest as he asked.

"Troublemakers. They dare not enter, so they just shout outside!" Leng Qiuchan's eyes flashed coldly; this was her first time being confronted so openly.

"I'll go check!" Zheng Xin's words had barely finished when his body vanished like the wind.

"Dongbo, what do we do? The bamboo forest has isolated our voices!" Fang Junming's face twisted with a bitter smile.

"What if we try to flatten this bamboo forest together?" Chen Yuhe stepped forward from the side, addressing the two.

"Are you seeking death? You know well Meng Yao's strength; angering her would mean we all suffer!" Dongbo Yongsi and Fang Junming shouted in protest.

"I didn't expect it to be you, Dongbo Senior and Fang Senior! Everyone, it's been a while since we last met, about three years ago. Oh, Chen Senior is also here—what a coincidence! Last time our conversation was incomplete; this time we must talk for three days and nights..." Zheng Xin's eyes gleamed as he began speaking without pause.

"Zheng... Zheng Xin... How come you're here!" The hundred people's faces twitched as they stared at Zheng Xin.

"Haha... it's been a while, everyone! Let's go celebrate our reunion with a feast!" Zheng Xin laughed as he approached the crowd.

"Uncle Dongbo, I have some matters to attend to; I'll come tomorrow!"

"Fang Senior, I just received a message from my father telling me to return home..."

"Chen Senior, I've been feeling a bit unwell lately; I need to go to the restroom..." As Zheng Xin's words finished, over half of the hundred people found excuses and prepared to leave.

Dongbo Yongsi and Fang Junming's faces darkened; with half the group leaving, their gazes toward Zheng Xin burned with resentment.

Leng Qiuchan, Jiang Nanxuan, and Meng Yao, fearing Zheng Xin might be harmed, summoned Qingshe and the parrot to care for Longbao before heading outside the bamboo forest.

As they exited, they witnessed a spectacular scene: Zheng Xin's saliva flying as he spoke to Dongbo Yongsi and the others.

Behind Dongbo Yongsi's group, people kept decreasing until fewer than fifty remained.

"Unexpectedly, Zheng Xin has such use!" Meng Yao smiled lightly.

"So, people's characteristics—whether they're virtues or vices—are useful in certain situations!" Jiang Nanxuan's face had returned to calmness, his gaze slightly directed toward Zheng Xin, who was speaking fervently.

"Only the two of you can tolerate Zheng Xin; I haven't found anyone else who could endure him!" Leng Qiuchan looked at Jiang Nanxuan and Meng Yao as if seeing a monster.

Leng Qiuchan had always admired Jiang Nanxuan and Meng Yao, not because of Jiang Nanxuan's mastery of formations and seals or Meng Yao's terrifying strength, but because when Zheng Xin spoke to them, both listened attentively without the slightest expression of disdain.

"Go away..." Dongbo Yongsi and his companions breathed heavily, having experienced Zheng Xin's tongue before. They shouted loudly but dared not act, as Zheng Xin was from the Wind-Quick Valley, not the Lingzong Sect. If they injured him, it would be a bad reputation for both outside and the Wind-Quick Valley.

"Senior Dongbo, why so hasty? Let's..." Zheng Xin seemed to ignore them, smiling as he continued speaking.

"Jiang Nanxuan... you finally came out!" Fang Junyong spotted Jiang Nanxuan and shouted.

"Did you need something from me?" Jiang Nanxuan's face remained calm as he spoke softly.

"Hand over Luotian, or we won't be polite today!"

"Yes! Let Luotian come out to meet us!" The forty-plus people behind them shouted loudly, clearly at their limit.

After waiting so many days without seeing Luotian's face, Zheng Xin's constant talking had made them increasingly annoyed. If they didn't see Luotian, they would definitely charge in and drag him out without hesitation.

At the moment of confrontation between both sides, Luotian sat alone in the bamboo hut, sweat beading on his face as it fell to the ground. His body emitted a crackling sound, with five primordial bones radiating light as primordial energy continuously gathered into them.

"Crack..." As if something had broken, Luotian's five primordial bones burst with infinite light. Wisps of primordial energy drifted from the bones, returning to his expanded cultivation core at the late Bone-Transformation stage.

Not long after, a vortex of primordial energy formed in the sky, continuously rushing into Luotian's cultivation core. Then it flowed out to his bones. After several cycles, Luotian slowly opened his eyes.

"Late Bone-Transformation stage? Not enough! I'll break through to the peak of Bone-Transformation at once!" Luotian whispered, and the bamboo hut roared again.

With a wave of his hand, a large amount of primordial energy stones filled the bamboo hut. A few pills fell into his hand, which he immediately swallowed.

"Five five-star pills, two million primordial energy stones. With my previous accumulation, it's enough to reach the peak of Bone-Transformation!" Luotian sighed softly and sat cross-legged again, beginning to fervently refine the pills' power and absorb the energy from the scattered primordial energy stones.

"Jiang Nanxuan... I'll count to three; if you don't let Luotian out, we'll charge in!" Dongbo Yongsi saw the massive vortex of primordial energy above the bamboo forest, his face showing a hint of surprise before he bypassed Zheng Xin and addressed Jiang Nanxuan.

"Are you daring? Whoever dares to step into this bamboo forest, I Leng Qiuchan swear to erase their cultivation!" Leng Qiuchan's face bore coldness, her gaze scanning the remaining forty-plus people.

"Little Qiuchan! This has nothing to do with you; it's a matter between men. Since the Sect Leader has acknowledged this Luotian as the Young Sect Master, he must prove his worth in cultivation or else he'll be helpless within Lingzong."

"Yes, we also want to know what qualifications he has to marry you. If he's a failure, we won't accept it!" The forty-plus people spoke.

"Stop talking nonsense; I said, either wait outside or there's no deal!" Leng Qiuchan coldly replied.

"Little Qiuchan, then I'll take my leave!" Dongbo Yongsi finally showed impatience, waving to the forty-plus people behind him!

Chapter 378: Are You Looking for Me?

Chapter 378: Are You Looking for Me?

Under Dongbo Yongsi's signal, the thirty-plus young masters of Bone-Transformation instantly surrounded Leng Qiuchan and Meng Yao.

Swords hummed, Leng Qiuchan's face bore coldness as she surveyed the forty-plus Bone-Transformation masters.

Dongbo Yongsi and his companions exchanged glances before their bodies sprang forward like leopards into the bamboo forest.

"Stop!" Leng Qiuchan coldly snorted, taking a step with the Heaven-Blocking Step to block their path.

"Block Little Qiuchan for me!" Dongbo Yongsi shouted.

As his words finished, the forty-plus Bone-Transformation masters erupted in power, blocking Leng Qiuchan's path. Their bodies radiated energy, and a formidable aura burst from their forms.

"Go!" Dongbo Yongsi coldly snorted, his body again rushing toward the bamboo forest. The three of them created strong fluctuations of energy beneath their feet, the sect's Heaven-Blocking Step.

In an instant, their figures appeared deep within the bamboo forest, faces showing a hint of joy.

A crisp sound echoed as Jiang Nanxuan was surrounded by the forty-plus people, his face still calm. He raised a hand toward the sky and gave a sharp whistle; the bamboo forest trembled slightly again.

"Let's fight! No matter what schemes they have, absolute strength makes them nothing!" Fang Junming coldly snorted, his fists glowing with golden light as he punched the bamboo in front of him.

On the other side, Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin also began fighting the forty-plus Bone-Transformation masters. Neither side held back, as they were all sect disciples; if they truly killed someone, the situation would become serious.

The sound of explosions echoed in both the bamboo forest's exterior and interior. Dongbo Yongsi kept smashing the bamboo in front of him, his face showing surprise; they hadn't expected Jiang Nanxuan's formation mastery to be so high, making them feel like they couldn't move forward with just a few bamboo trees.

Among the young generation of Lingzong, they were also top-tier talents with late Bone-Transformation and dual-element body types. Now, they were struggling against a few bamboo trees.

"Shall I intervene?" Meng Yao stood in front of Jiang Nanxuan, her face showing concern.

"It's fine... this formation will keep them occupied for enough time!" Jiang Nanxuan smiled slightly, gazing toward the bamboo forest's depths.

At this moment, Luotian's face turned red again; the mountain of primordial energy stones in his room had been completely absorbed, shattered within the room. His five-star pills were also fully refined.

Sweat dripped steadily to the ground, his face unusually solemn. A sky-high aura radiated from his seemingly frail body, and a vortex of primordial energy formed above his head, ten times larger than before.

Not only did the bamboo forest's primordial energy gather toward Luotian, but all of Lingzong's sky seemed to converge toward him.

A sense of exhilaration arose in Luotian's heart; his five primordial bones seemed to transform into ravenous beasts, each forming a vortex of primordial energy that passed through his bones, refining them while gathering into his cultivation core.

Meanwhile, the battle outside the bamboo forest continued; Jiang Nanxuan and Meng Yao stood calmly watching.

At this moment, Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xin had fallen behind; although they were extraordinary, being surrounded by forty-plus Bone-Transformation initiates—among them several late Bone-Transformation masters—made it difficult for them to endure. This was even before they had unleashed their full power; if they did, they would have already been obliterated.

"Senior Brother, can't we talk this over? Calmly discuss it instead of fighting... we're all from the same sect..." Even under attack, Zheng Xin hadn't changed his old habit. His hammer moved like lightning among the crowd, occasionally striking one but mostly enduring punches and kicks himself.

Leng Qiuchan was somewhat better; as a girl and the sect leader's daughter, she had high popularity within Lingzong. If it weren't for targeting Luotian, these people might have defected to help Leng Qiuchan block Dongbo Yongsi. Thus, they only surrounded but didn't attack her.

Leng Qiuchan panted heavily, gazing toward the bamboo forest, her coldness more intense.

Dongbo Yongsi's group also panted slightly; they didn't know how many bamboo trees they had broken, but their bodies slowly pushed forward.

Hundreds of bamboo trees were shattered under their attacks; after half an hour, they finally reached the courtyard.

"Here we are!" The three took a deep breath, their faces showing excitement.

But when they looked into the courtyard, their faces showed a hint of shock; in the bamboo hut where Luotian sat, a massive vortex of primordial energy hovered above it, slowly flowing into the hut that had no roof.

In the courtyard stood a boy who looked only five or six years old, currently riding a green dragon snake. His hands held a colorful parrot, and his small hands flapped up and down, scattering colorful feathers across the ground.

The three were stunned; naturally, they could sense that the snake and bird were beasts comparable to late Bone-Transformation. Yet, under a child's control, they had no resistance and were being tormented by the boy.

Seeming to sense someone's arrival, Longbao showed a naive expression and looked at Dongbo Yongsi: "Who are you?"

"Uh..." The three stood awkwardly, unsure how to respond. The situation before them was truly strange.

"Little... little boy, have you seen a person named Luotian?" Chen Yuhe spoke first, his face showing what he thought was a kind smile.

"You... your brother?" The three were completely stunned; if the younger sibling was so terrifying, what would the older one be like?

Looking at the massive vortex of primordial energy above the sky, they felt some regret.

"You're looking for trouble, right?" Longbao got up from the flattened green dragon snake and walked toward the three, looking at them while flexing his fists.

"No... no..." The three were Bone-Transformation masters, naturally sensing the explosive power within Longbao's body. They didn't know how to speak at that moment.

"Buzz..." As the three were unsure of what to say, the massive vortex of primordial energy suddenly surged toward the bamboo hut.

"Boom..." The sound of explosions echoed, and the bamboo hut could not withstand the primordial energy's impact, collapsing completely. A young man sat on the ground was revealed.

A cold voice echoed in their ears: "You? Are you looking for me?"

Chapter 379: Establishing Authority

Chapter 379: Establishing Authority

Wind howled, and the cold voice echoed like a frigid wind from the nine hells in their hearts, making them shiver involuntarily.

They instinctively looked at Luotian sitting on the ground, their minds suddenly shaking with fear. They felt as if facing a beast of blood and waves.

Luotian suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze like lightning, causing their minds to tremble again.

This glance was like a bolt of lightning in the darkness, striking them fiercely.

"Did you need something?" Luotian smiled lightly, gently caressing the Nirvana Dragon Seal on his hand.

He stood up, and a crisp sound echoed from his body as he looked at the three with contempt, slowly walking toward them.

Their bodies trembled slightly; looking at Luotian, but their eyes showed a hint of struggle. Chen Yuhe spoke first: "Yes, we're looking for you!"

"Luotian!" Leng Qiuchan's joyful voice reached Luotian's ears, and she appeared like lightning in front of him.

Zheng Xin and the others also slowly walked out from the crowd. When Jiang Nanxuan and Meng Yao saw the crushed green dragon snake and parrot, their lips twitched slightly. Their eyes unintentionally swept toward Longbao, who was clinging to Luotian's pants.

Upon seeing Longbao, Jiang Nanxuan's calm face was filled with shock, then his calm gaze flashed with brilliant light as he looked at Longbao. He hadn't noticed the boy before, but now he was paying attention, vaguely guessing Longbao's identity.

Feeling someone looking at him, Longbao instinctively looked toward Jiang Nanxuan. When he saw Jiang Nanxuan's gaze, the fearless Longbao seemed to see something terrifying and instinctively tightened his grip on Luotian's pants.

Behind them, over forty Bone-Transformation masters from Lingzong also followed, standing behind Dongbo Yongsi's group. Their eyes carried fear as they looked at Luotian.

At this moment, everyone felt that Luotian was unfathomable; although he was alone, his aura was no less than the combined strength of them all.

"Everyone, what's your business?" Luotian looked at the forty-plus people without the slightest tension. If it were past, he might have been cautious, but now he had enough confidence to face them.

Although these people felt Luotian was unusual, some still didn't know their place, thinking that since they were in the majority, even if this person was extraordinary, he couldn't do much to them.

"Yes, we're looking for you! Get out of Lingzong and give up the Young Sect Master position!" Someone in the crowd shouted.

"Hmph..." Luotian coldly snorted, his body vanishing instantly and appearing in front of the young man who spoke. His fist was wrapped with five-color primordial energy, and he launched a punch.

"Spit... crack..." The young man hadn't finished speaking when he felt someone flash by, as if hit by something. He spat blood and flew backward, his face showing intense disbelief.

"Ah..." The people gasped involuntarily. They recognized the young man; he was famous within Lingzong, and what shocked them more was that this youth was a Bone-Transformation middle-stage master with his primordial bone being the chest bone.

Dongbo Yongsi's group showed a hint of fear; they hadn't reacted to Luotian's speed, and the punch had shattered a primordial bone. This was already an extraordinary feat in their eyes.

"Late Bone-Transformation..." Someone in the crowd spoke tremblingly, his face showing intense disbelief.

"How is that possible!"

"He's so young, yet already at the peak of Bone-Transformation!" Their eyes carried shock as they looked at Luotian.

Indeed, Luotian was now at the peak of Bone-Transformation after months of suppression; this full release had brought him to the Late Bone-Transformation stage.

At this moment, Luotian was absolutely a senior-level figure in some sects of the Northern Region. The terrifying nature of his Five-Element Body was evident; after all, Luotian was only twenty-two years old.

Luotian punched the young man and didn't stop, appearing again in front of him. He grabbed the half-dead youth and threw him at Jiang Nanxuan's feet.

"Senior Nanxuan, you're the host here; how should we handle this?" Luotian's face remained calm as he returned to his original spot.

"I need a drop of blood, one for each person; this matter will be settled!" Jiang Nanxuan's face remained calm.

"Did you hear that?" Luotian smiled calmly, scanning the forty-plus Bone-Transformation disciples of Lingzong.

"Daydreaming!"

"What right do you have to say that!"

"Let's fight; we're forty people, and we won't be afraid of you!" The crowd immediately erupted in chaos, with many shouting.

"Boom... boom... boom..." Hearing the people's shouts, Luotian's lips slightly curled. His body vanished again, and the sound of bones breaking echoed throughout the crowd. Each Lingzong disciple was thrown in front of Jiang Nanxuan and others like dead dogs.

"Ah..." Dongbo Yongsi's group looked extremely grim; they hadn't expected Luotian to be so strong, at the peak of Bone-Transformation with a terrifying body type. This made them feel powerless.

But when they saw the Lingzong disciples thrown there, like dead dogs, everyone felt fear.

They knew Luotian was establishing authority; they were certain that even if they had said those words, their treatment would be no better than these people, perhaps even worse, since they were the leaders.

"A drop of blood, I see you're not willing, right?"

"In fact, my habit is three drops!" Luotian calmly spoke under the crowd's shock.

Leng Qiuchan heard Luotian's words, her lips slightly curled under her veil. Her eyes showed a nostalgic look, recalling the scene in Dian Forest where Luotian had forced Ying Hongtu and Tu Yu Zheng to give blood. At that time, he was even more霸道.

Hearing Luotian's words, the people's faces showed a sense of委屈 (resentment). A single drop of blood was acceptable, but three drops would be a major injury, enough for them to recover for a long time.

"However, since you're all disciples of Lingzong, I, the Young Sect Master, won't be unkind. Two drops! Bring them yourself and you can leave." Luotian didn't heed the crowd's noise, speaking again.

"Daydreaming! You really think you're someone special!" Chen Yuhe's face showed a sinister expression; he couldn't bear Luotian's tone. This was what they had anticipated, but now it was reversed.

"Hmph... others can leave with two drops of blood, but you three! No!" Luotian's eyes flashed coldly as his body vanished again.

Chapter 380: Crushing

Chapter 380: Crushing

"Let's fight!" Seeing Luotian rushing toward them, the three men's faces showed fierce expressions. Their bodies radiated energy as their late Bone-Transformation cultivation fully erupted.

Behind them, the people watched with anticipation, looking at Dongbo Yongsi and his group. They were their last hope; if they lost, there would be no chance left.

"Sky-Blocking Step!" Chen Yuhe's face showed struggle as he felt Luotian's fist wind. He dared not confront it directly and activated the Sky-Blocking Step, vanishing from his spot to appear a hundred feet away.

"Sky-Blocking Step?" Luotian's lips slightly curled, golden light flashing under his feet as he instantly appeared in front of Chen Yuhe. His fist smashed into Chen Yuhe's chest.

"Sky-Blocking Step, fourth step! How does he know the fourth step of Sky-Blocking Step? He's only been in Lingzong for a few days!" Someone in the crowd gasped.

Chen Yuhe, who had dual-element water and wood attributes, was knocked away like a kite by Luotian's punch.

"So strong! Chen Yuhe is a late Bone-Transformation master with dual-element attributes, yet he couldn't even withstand one punch from Luotian! Is this person human?"

"听说 Chen Yuhe once fought with a late Bone-Transformation master. Why now, when facing Luotian who is also at the peak of Bone-Transformation, does he seem like a chicken, getting knocked away with one punch?" The people's faces showed confusion as they looked at Luotian, who seemed like a warrior.

"Die! Splitting Emperor's Claws!" Dongbo Yongsi saw Luotian's back facing him and quickly formed his hands, summoning a翠绿色 (emerald green) hand claw that shot toward Luotian's back.

"Splitting Emperor's Claws! Dongbo Yongsi, you despicable and shameless person! Using an advanced technique of the Xuan grade while sneaking attack!" Leng Qiuchan shouted.

"Crack..." Luotian's back was grabbed by the green hand claw, his clothes torn apart, revealing his fit back.

Dongbo Yongsi's face showed a hint of joy; he hadn't expected Luotian to be so careless, leaving his back exposed for his technique.

"Zhi zhi..." A terrible sound came from Luotian's back, and several white marks appeared on his fit back.

"Impossible!" Zheng Xin's face showed intense disbelief as he looked at Luotian's back. Besides the torn clothes, there were only a few white marks on his back.

Not just Zheng Xin, everyone's faces showed disbelief; they hadn't expected Luotian's body to be so strong.

"This is the terrifying nature of the Five-Element Body! The longer one cultivates, the higher their level becomes; they are more terrifying than ordinary warriors!" Jiang Nanxuan calmly spoke.

"This kid's body alone is already invincible at the Bone-Transformation stage!" Meng Yao smiled lightly.

Dongbo Yongsi was completely stunned; he knew his technique's power well. Although it wasn't his strongest, it was an advanced Xuan grade technique. It was also his dual-element cultivation that made it stronger than ordinary high-grade Xuan techniques.

Yet, his prideful technique had done nothing to Luotian, leaving him with a sense of helplessness.

Under everyone's gaze, Luotian slowly turned around, his face showing mockery as he took advantage of Dongbo Yongsi's momentary hesitation. His foot shot out, his body like lightning as he kicked Dongbo Yongsi's abdomen.

Dongbo Yongsi barely regained his senses when he spat blood and followed Chen Yuhe's path.

"You still want to come?" Luotian turned around abruptly, looking at the remaining Fang Junming with a playful smile. His eyes showed amusement.

Fang Junming, seeing that Luotian had knocked down Dongbo Yongsi and Chen Yuhe in two breaths, had lost all confidence to resist. Unless he fought with his last strength and burned blood, there was no chance left.

"Is there anyone else who doesn't accept me as the Young Sect Master? Come forward!" Luotian's lips slightly curled, his gaze sweeping over the remaining thirty-plus people.

Wherever his eyes passed, everyone lowered their heads. Although some still felt resentment, they had to bow under the roof; their leaders were already crushed by him. They weren't even as good as Dongbo Yongsi's group.

"If you've accepted it, then take one drop of blood as Jiang Senior said. For this first meeting, I'll give you two drops as a gift from the Young Sect Master!" Luotian waved his hand generously.

"Damn it!"

"Don't be shameless!" Everyone's hearts shouted, but they only dared to curse mentally. Their faces didn't show it; some even wore respectful smiles, cutting their wrists and taking a drop of blood to give to Luotian.

Seeing the first person, others followed suit, taking their drops of blood and giving them to Luotian. Luotian took them all without hesitation, passing them to Jiang Nanxuan.

"Thank you!" Jiang Nanxuan's calm face finally showed a hint of joy, his eyes full of gratitude toward Luotian.

Seeing Jiang Nanxuan's expression, Luotian smiled lightly: "It should be me thanking you. If it weren't for you, I would have remained imprisoned forever; it was really painful!"

"Longbao, come quickly and thank this big brother. From now on, you can sleep whenever you want or play whenever you want; no longer need to return to that imprisonment!" Luotian picked up Longbao, his face showing indulgence.

At this moment, Luotian was already at the peak of Bone-Transformation and could completely lift Longbao. Not only Longbao, but even a mountain could be easily lifted by Luotian.

"Thank you, big brother!" Longbao's face showed innocence as he spoke softly.

"Haha, Longbao, look at how hard Jiang Senior worked to help us; we should be grateful, right?" Luotian smiled.

"Yes!" Longbao nodded earnestly.

Before Luotian could speak further, the forty-plus people who had been standing there spoke: "Um... Young Sect Master, if there's nothing else, we'll take our leave!"

The forty-plus people spoke in confusion, expressing their intention to leave. They didn't want to stay a moment longer here; they had lost one drop of blood and needed to recover quickly.

"Go, remember not to bother me anymore!" Luotian waved his hand, as if shooing flies.

"Goodbye!" Dongbo Yongsi and the others took out a drop of blood, feeling extremely委屈 (resentment), their faces flushed red as they spoke to Luotian.

"Wait! They can go, but you three still can't leave!" Luotian's playful voice echoed in their ears.

"Luotian, don't push it too far; don't force us. If we're desperate, we'll burn our blood. Even if we can't beat you, you'll be injured!" Chen Yuhe hissed lowly, his eyes red as he looked at Luotian.

Chapter 381: Planting Bamboo

Chapter 381: Planting Bamboo

Ignoring their angry gazes, Luotian smiled and continued: "You've destroyed the bamboo forest; don't you think you should make amends? Just walk away like that?"

After saying this, Luotian looked toward Jiang Nanxuan and Meng Yao, who remained calm.

At this moment, Jiang Nanxuan was fiddling with the blood on the stone table, while Meng Yao held a bamboo pole. The leaves gently fell into her hand, and although she didn't emit any aura, the more calm she was, the more intimidated the three felt.

"They forgot this auntie!" The three thought bitterly in their hearts; they knew Meng Yao was even more terrifying than Luotian.

They were aware of what was sealed within Meng Yao's body—something that even a master at the Reincarnation stage had to burn their entire cultivation to seal.

"Meng Yao Senior, we'll compensate for the destroyed bamboo forest. Look at this... this..." Dongbo Yongsi smiled nervously, looking at Meng Yao.

"I planted these bamboo; you decide what to do!" Meng Yao's face was calm, her two fingers gently pinching a bamboo leaf. Green light flickered.

"Sky... Sky Bamboo..." Dongbo Yongsi and the others were stunned; they knew of Sky Bamboo. According to records, this bamboo could grow for a thousand years, one zhang per year, and the tallest could reach ten thousand zhang. A bamboo of ten thousand zhang was no longer called bamboo but a treasure, and with Sky Bamboo's rarity, it became even more precious.

Although this bamboo forest hadn't reached the legendary ten thousand zhang, only dozens of zhang high, it was still beyond their means to compensate. How could they pay?

"This..." The three were at a loss for words; they hadn't expected this unassuming bamboo to be Sky Bamboo.

"Pick up the broken bamboo poles and place them aside. Then plant these seeds, and every day use your primordial energy to catalyze it. Once the bamboo grows ten zhang high, you can leave. Any objections?" Meng Yao's voice was calm as she held the bamboo leaf.

"No... no!" The three dared not delay; people had already left most of the crowd, but some remained. Seeing their punishment, they felt slightly better.

Dongbo Yongsi and the others' faces looked like they had eaten dirt; they had intended to defeat Luotian strongly, but instead were crushed by him. Not only did they lose blood, but they had to plant bamboo for him. Planting bamboo was one thing, but every day they had to use their hard-earned primordial energy to catalyze the seemingly useless bamboo. Their faces were in disarray.

After this, they would definitely be disgraced within Lingzong, while Luotian's reputation would soar. The Young Sect Master position was solid; although some might still be不服 (discontent), they wouldn't dare to provoke Luotian.

Under the smiles of Luotian and others, Dongbo Yongsi and the three left to tidy up the broken Sky Bamboo.

"Haha... everything's resolved; can we have a chat now?" Zheng Xin laughed loudly.

"Kick!" Luotian kicked Zheng Xin, who landed right in front of Dongbo Yongsi and the others.

Zheng Xin knew that Luotian and Jiang Nanxuan might have important matters, but he couldn't help. Seeing Dongbo Yongsi, Zheng Xin's eyes lit up and began to chat with them, making their already pale faces even more grim.

"Longbao, come here..." Luotian smiled slightly, placing Longbao on his lap.

Jiang Nanxuan's eyes also sparkled as he looked at Longbao; the fact that Jiang Nanxuan, who was usually calm, showed such an expression made Leng Qiuchan and Meng Yao feel surprised. Their eyes unintentionally turned to the boy.

Everyone had seen Longbao for the first time, even Leng Qiuchan, who was familiar with Luotian, had never seen Longbao before.

Feeling everyone's gaze on him, Longbao instinctively shivered; especially the looks from Luotian and Jiang Nanxuan made him hesitant to approach Luotian.

"Longbao, you said earlier that you wanted to repay Jiang Nanxuan Senior; do you remember?" Luotian guided Longbao forward.

Seeming to instinctively trust Luotian, Longbao returned to his innocence and nodded at Luotian.

"So now it's like this: Jiang Nanxuan Senior needs a drop of your blood; to repay his kindness, we should give it to him, right?" Luotian finally revealed the purpose.

"No..." Longbao's lips slightly curled.

"I'll give you candy..."

"No..."

"I'll take you to play..."

"..."
