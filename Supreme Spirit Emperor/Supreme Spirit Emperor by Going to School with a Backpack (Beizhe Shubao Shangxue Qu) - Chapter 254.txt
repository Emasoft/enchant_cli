“Dammit, these blue lightning bolts each have the power to slay a late-stage Saint! What kind of monster is that guy from the Zhu Ge Imperial Court? How could he possess such a formidable martial technique!” Zheng Xin and Wan Lingkong cursed, their eyes filled with solemnity as they did not leave the arena for a single moment.

“Don’t worry, Luo Tian Senior won’t be harmed. His physical body is the strongest I’ve ever seen!” Chen Zhanbiao shook his head gently, clearly confident in Luo Tian.

“Exactly! A mere Zhu Ge Imperial Court—among equals, Luo Tian is invincible!” Zheng Xin and the others regained their confidence. Luo Tian had never let them down.

As everyone was discussing, Luo Tian clashed with the six blue lightning bolts. The thunderous impact echoed, streaks of azure light flashed, striking the arena.

Luo Tian’s body was shrouded in black qi. The Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist continuously struck, each punch colliding with the lightning imbued with heavenly laws. From afar, Luo Tian seemed like a divine being descending from heaven, bathed in lightning.

“This time he’ll surely lose!” Zhu Ge Huangchao fell to the ground, utterly drained of strength. His eyes watched Luo Tian fiercely resisting the blue lightning.

“Great Dao Sealing Demon!” Luo Tian’s black aura flared, his fists striking like a madman.

Shattered stones pierced the sky; within the solid barrier, broken rocks surged endlessly. Dust rose as Luo Tian vanished beneath the thunder and dust, disappearing from sight.

The thunderous echoes continued. All could only hear the resounding booms within the barrier, sending shivers down people’s spines. Probing with their spiritual awareness was instantly obliterated by the wild fluctuations.

After a full quarter of an hour, the thunderous echoes gradually faded. People’s eyes gleamed with anticipation. Even the six half-step Era masters seated there gazed at the barrier, their eyes filled with admiration.

“This boy truly deserves to be a reincarnation body. His blood and qi are formidable, his physical form unyielding—such an attack could still be endured!” Yan Xiuluo of the Shura Domain, his eyes gleamed with wonder. His profound gaze seemed to pierce through everything.

“Hum…” A wave of energy spread as a black figure appeared in people’s sight. His body bore faint cracks, and streaks of blue lightning danced across the fissures.

“How could this be!” Upon the black figure’s emergence, Zhu Ge Huangchao’s face showed disbelief.

“Do you have any more techniques?” Luo Tian appeared above Zhu Ge Huangchao’s head, his foot extending to crush Zhu Ge Huangchao’s head.

“Boom…” Still in shock, Zhu Ge Huangchao was crushed by a single footstep. Blood splattered across the arena.

Luo Tian did not stop. He seized Zhu Ge Huangchao’s body, waiting for his head to regenerate.

After a moment, Zhu Ge Huangchao appeared before Luo Tian with a pale face, his eyes filled with terror.

“Smack!” Luo Tian’s massive hand swung, delivering a slap across Zhu Ge Huangchao’s face. His cold voice echoed in Zhu Ge Huangchao’s ears: “You wanted to stomp me underfoot, didn’t you?”

“You sought to eliminate my future enemies by crushing them, didn’t you?”

“Didn’t you boast of your superiority, looking down on everyone?” Luo Tian showed no intention to stop. He controlled his strength carefully, keeping Zhu Ge Huangchao conscious but not killing him.

A murmur spread. People watched Luo Tian’s slaps fall one after another, their mouths twitching as they silently marveled. Who dared to strike a saint’s heir in front of their domain master?

“Boom…” Luo Tian felt he had delivered enough. He flung Zhu Ge Huangchao onto the lightning platform and stood before him: “Have you submitted?”

Zhu Ge Huangchao felt his head throb. Never before had he suffered such humiliation; the psychological blow was heavier than any physical one.

“Haha! Zhu Ge Huangchao, keep being arrogant. Earlier I was the number one under heaven; now you’ve been beaten into a pig’s head. I’m dying laughing!” Zheng Xin and the others spoke without restraint, their voices filled with strong mockery. Each word pierced Zhu Ge Huangchao’s heart.

“Spit…” Zhu Ge Huangchao, enraged and desperate, spat out black blood. His eyes were lifeless as he sat on the arena, gazing at people’s mocking glances.

“His character is insufficient. This child has never faced adversity, always sailing smoothly. If he can learn from this setback, it might be a good thing. If not, then he’s ruined!” Han Dun Domain Master Zhu Ge Haotian sighed, his hand waving as he pulled Zhu Ge Huangchao to him. Some things needed self-realization.

“Hum…” Under people’s reverent gazes, Luo Tian exited the barrier and walked toward Zheng Xin and the others. His face was expressionless; such events had become too common.

“Excellent job, Luo Tian!” Zheng Xin and the others surrounded him, chattering endlessly.

“Luo Tian truly ended the battle first!” People murmured, their eyes turning to the other two ongoing battles.

Luo Tian’s gaze also turned toward the two battlefields, his eyes flickering with a hint of amusement.

“After awakening his bloodline power, Long Jie is terrifying. He had long subtly suppressed Zhou Wei!” Zheng Xin and the others observed all three battles, explaining to Luo Tian.

“Even I might not be his match. Zhou Wei’s strength is undeniable; even if I faced him, winning would be a challenge!” Luo Tian saw the two’s battle, which was no less intense than his clash with Zhu Ge Huangchao.

His eyes watched Long Jie, whose aura of imperial dragon law was everywhere. Even without revealing his true form, the imperial dragon law he unleashed was terrifying. Awakening his bloodline power, Long Jie could now fully unleash his strength without needing to reveal his true form.

Chapter 1087: Even Match ()

On the demon clan’s arena, thunderous echoes continued. Though quieter than before, people had marveled at Luo Tian’s victory. Their attention returned to the arena as the other two battles were equally thrilling, leaving them exhilarated.

Long Jie, a rising star of the Beast Domain, had bloodline power so intense it rivaled that of Dragon Ancestor Long Zhan Tian. Even Feng Jiutian of the Phoenix Clan, a major clan in the Beast Domain, could not match Long Jie. He was undeniably the top talent of the Beast Domain.

Zhou Wei, a mysterious prodigy of the Starry Sky Domain, always appeared composed. Even against Long Jie, Zhou Wei’s face bore a smile.

Ferocious martial arts continuously clashed between them. Since they had previously been on good terms, they did not fight as fiercely as Luo Tian and Zhu Ge Huangchao. Still, their strength was enough to rival the one Luo Tian had severely beaten earlier—perhaps even stronger.

On another side, Sun Feiwen of the Divine Clan and Yan Hongtao’s battle was equally spectacular. Though Sun Feiwen’s brilliance had been overshadowed by Sun Mengru, his current strength was formidable. His invincibility left the Divine and Demon Domains in awe.

The Shura Domain excelled at assassination, but this direct battle was disadvantageous for Yan Hongtao. Yet, as a late-stage Saint, he skillfully countered Sun Feiwen’s divine arts.

Time passed slowly. The four combatants’ martial arts grew stronger, their eyes gleaming with excitement.

After an hour, the four were all battered but their eyes sparkled with light.

“Let’s decide the victor!” Sun Feiwen panted, looking at Yan Hongtao, whose body was nearly shattered.

Sun Feiwen’s condition wasn’t great either. His two arms had been torn off by Yan Hongtao but regrew instantly.

“Divine King Regeneration Art!” People gasped, seeing Sun Feiwen’s arms regrow.

Divine King Regeneration Art was one of the Divine Clan’s divine arts. Alongside Divine King Seal and Divine King Nine Heavens Map, it was one of the three divine arts. Among them, Divine King Regeneration Art was the most difficult to master.

“Unsurpassed! The Divine Clan’s prodigy has mastered the Divine King Regeneration Art!” People inhaled sharply, gazing at Sun Feiwen whose hands glowed with divine light.

“You have more than the two great divine bodies. You also have such a prodigy!” Several domain masters sighed, looking at Sun Feiwen with admiration. They hadn’t expected this unassuming figure to be so powerful.

Yan Hongtao’s eyes narrowed. As a Shura Domain prodigy, he had heard of the Divine Clan’s three divine arts and their terrifying power.

“Shura Immortal Body!” Yan Hongtao moved his hands, gathering blood qi into his body. His form instantly returned to full strength. A crimson dragon of blood coalesced in his hands, as if emerging from hell.

“Divine King Nine Heavens Map!”

“Shura Slash!” Sun Feiwen and Yan Hongtao spoke in unison. A nine-tiered heavenly diagram burst from Sun Feiwen’s hands, pressing down with the weight of four great continents. Yan Hongtao conjured a blood-red sickle, slicing through the diagram.

The thunderous collision of two ultimate forces echoed. The explosive power surged outward, shaking the surrounding barriers with a humming sound.

“Cough… cough…” Sun Feiwen spat blood, his eyes filled with shock. He had never expected the Divine King Nine Heavens Map to be blocked by Yan Hongtao.

“Kid, fighting while divided is no good!” As Sun Feiwen was stunned, Yan Hongtao’s cold voice echoed within the barrier.

His ghostly form appeared behind Sun Feiwen, a blood-red sickle pressed against his neck. The bloody scent invaded Sun Feiwen’s nose, causing his face to change instantly. But in the next moment, a cold chill surged into his hands.

“If it were real combat, you’d already be dead!” Yan Hongtao stood behind Sun Feiwen, retracting the sickle and wiping blood from his lips.

“Still, you’re strong. In my eyes, you’re better than that useless Zhu Ge Huangchao! If it were a direct clash at the same level, I might not have beaten you!” Yan Hongtao continued.

“Losing is losing. I can accept it!” Sun Feiwen expelled the cold chill from his body and spoke to Yan Hongtao.

After saying that, Sun Feiwen returned to the crowd. Though he had lost, people still regarded him with respect. To battle Yan Hongtao for so long was proof of his strength. Plus, the Divine Clan had Sun Mengru; as long as she didn’t act recklessly, the Divine Clan would not lose.

“Good work. I almost died at his hands back then!” Luo Tian patted Sun Feiwen’s shoulder, his eyes filled with encouragement. He hadn’t expected Sun Feiwen to be this strong.

“Nothing serious, I just lost.” Sun Feiwen shook his head. He had decided to seek Yan Hongtao again when he reached late-stage Saint.

“There’s only one battle left—Long Jie and Zhou Wei!” People resumed their chatter, turning their eyes to the final battle.

“Even match!” Luo Tian’s gaze flickered with surprise as he watched Long Jie and Zhou Wei’s battle, a single thought rising in his mind.

At that moment, both were battered and bloodied. The aura of imperial dragon law clashed with the power of celestial phenomena, each collision making their faces pale.

After another two hours of battle, both were pale and unsteady on their feet.

“Final move! If you can withstand it, I’ll admit defeat. This is the only technique I can unleash at this moment!” Long Jie spoke softly, sensing his spiritual power.

“I’m about the same,” Zhou Wei smiled slightly. His smile was no longer natural, as he felt his spiritual power could only sustain one technique.

“Is this the moment to decide?” People watched the two standing opposite each other, gathering spiritual power. Their aura gradually rose.

“Starlight Illuminates the Blue Sky!” Zhou Wei spoke softly, and starry power interwove in his hands. It was Zhou Wei’s signature technique, one he had never used before because it consumed much and its power was hard to control. He feared hurting Long Jie.

But after battling Long Jie, Zhou Wei realized he had underestimated him. Even with Starlight Illuminates the Blue Sky, Long Jie might not be able to withstand it.

“True Dragon Battles Nine Heavens!” Facing Zhou Wei’s Starlight Illuminates the Blue Sky, Long Jie’s face showed solemnity. He roared, his dragon aura spreading.

“Dragon Battle Heaven’s technique?” When Long Jie spoke, the six domain masters’ faces slightly changed. They had all interacted with Dragon Battle Heaven before and knew his ultimate technique.

Long Jie’s hands formed nine true dragons, intertwining to form a force capable of devouring heaven and earth. They roared toward Zhou Wei.

“Block it!” Both men chose not to clash their techniques but instead to endure them with their physical bodies.

Starlight shimmered, the sky darkened. Stars fell, and strange phenomena arose. Starlight enveloped Zhou Wei.

Long Jie’s body emitted roaring dragon auras, protecting him with imperial dragon law.

In an instant, the two met their techniques. Strange energy wrapped Long Jie, as if he were caught in an invisible net that contracted relentlessly. If he couldn’t withstand it, his flesh and blood would be shattered.

“Roar…” Each imperial dragon aura roared, pushing back the invisible net.

“Boom… Boom…” But under this strange force, each imperial dragon aura shattered violently, turning into golden energy that spread around Long Jie.

Zhou Wei was no better off. Nine dragons instantly struck his body, dispersing his starry power.

The nine dragons continuously attacked Zhou Wei’s body. Each strike made him spit out large amounts of blood, his body showing cracks as if it could break at any moment.

“Block it!” The invisible net finally wrapped around Long Jie, turning him into a bloodied figure.

People’s eyes showed shock as they watched the two in their worst state. They hadn’t expected the most unassuming pair to be the bloodiest.

“Both are in big trouble!” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, watching the two suffering on the arena. He turned his gaze to the six domain masters above; only they had the strength to intervene.

“Enough. If they continue, these two kids will be seriously injured!” Biao Yuanshan spoke, his voice heavy with concern.

“Yes. Stop them!” Starry Sky Domain Master spoke, both of them acting in unison. Each conjured two streams of light to break the chains around the two.

“Huff…” Long Jie and Zhou Wei both sighed deeply. They looked at each other, then fell onto the arena.

Zheng Xin and others were quick to act. As soon as the two fell, they rushed onto the arena, pulling them back into the crowd and giving them pills.

“Excellent!” People cheered for Zhou Wei, their eyes burning with admiration as they watched Long Jie and Zhou Wei.

After cheering for a while, people pulled themselves out of the battle’s excitement. Their eyes turned to Luo Tian and Yan Hongtao.

Chapter 1088: Re-fighting Yan Hongtao ()

On the demon clan’s mountain, millions of people seemed to be boiling. Three battles between prodigies were all exceptionally thrilling. Luo Tian had utterly crushed Zhu Ge Huangchao with his overwhelming strength, Yan Hongtao had finally defeated Sun Feiwen, and Long Jie and Zhou Wei had evenly matched.

People gradually shifted their attention from Long Jie and Zhou Wei to Luo Tian and Yan Hongtao.

At this point, it was clear that Long Jie and Zhou Wei had no more strength. Their previous exhaustion was immense; if not for the domain masters’ intervention, they might have ended up as mutual destruction. Though they wouldn’t die, they would need a long time to recover.

Luo Tian and Yan Hongtao had some exhaustion, but after this period of recovery, they clearly still had the strength to fight again.

“Luo Tian, Yan Hongtao. Do you two still want to continue? You can choose to stop; after all, it’s just a friendly exchange. Whether to fight or not is up to you two!” The Demon Lord himself spoke, his gaze on Yan Hongtao and Luo Tian, waiting for their response.

Luo Tian turned to face Yan Hongtao. He felt the latter’s battle spirit and his aura gradually rose. Then he clenched his fists.

They said nothing, but their feet stirred with wind, both stepping onto the vast arena. Their meaning was clear.

“Hush…” As the two stood on the arena, the entire demon clan boiled with excitement. Murmurs arose as people’s eyes burned with eagerness, watching the two on the arena.

“Whoever wins this battle could be called the top prodigy of their generation!”

“Even if not, they would definitely rank in the top three within the nine domains!” People murmured, their eyes filled with intense anticipation. They wanted to witness the clash between two prodigies who had hopes of attaining the Era Master title, seeing who was stronger.

“Your progress is truly remarkable. I have no idea at all now!” Yan Hongtao smiled slightly, his blood-red sickle dancing in his hands. Those familiar with Yan Hongtao knew he was truly serious now.

“Back then, I almost died at your hands. Now I’m not the same person. I also want to avenge that grudge, so I stepped onto this arena!” Luo Tian spoke softly, summoning his spear and gazing at Yan Hongtao.

They had a grudge. Though Zhu Ge Huangchao’s appearance had slightly eased their tension, they were still enemies. Luo Tian had almost died at Yan Hongtao’s hands before, and Yan Hongtao had been hunted like a stray dog by the Divine Clan because of Luo Tian.

“Kill!” They didn’t speak much. Their bodies moved, and golden spears clashed with blood-red sickles.

“Begin!” People’s faces were filled with excitement, all guessing who would win the final victory.

“Shura Shadow Kill!” After a brief clash, Yan Hongtao’s figure vanished from Luo Tian’s sight, disappearing into the void.

Purple light burst in Luo Tian’s eyes. He saw through the void to find Yan Hongtao, but as his Purple Extreme Demon Eyes opened, Luo Tian’s feet stirred with wind. His Infernal Ghost Step activated, and he vanished from the arena.

Just after Luo Tian left his spot, the blood-red sickle appeared beneath him. People’s faces showed shock.

“Too fast! Their speed is too fast; I can’t keep up!” Some people gasped, their eyes wide but still unable to track their movements.

“Boom… Boom…” People could only hear the resounding booms, streaks of lightning flashing across the sky from the void.

As the thunderous echoes gradually faded, Luo Tian and Yan Hongtao’s figures appeared in people’s sight.

Both were battered, with minor injuries. For their incredibly strong bodies, it was no problem at all.

“Unexpectedly, your progress is so great. You can now match my speed. It seems I’ll have to show you my true strength!” Yan Hongtao licked his lips, blood trickling down. His eyes glowed red.

“Soul Severing Technique!” Yan Hongtao roared, his body moving toward Luo Tian. At the same time, a red light shot from Yan Hongtao’s forehead, forming his image.

Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed. He then leapt into the air, his hands moving swiftly. Seven destructive demon swords erupted from his hands, slicing toward Yan Hongtao’s body.

But just after Luo Tian finished his attack, his face suddenly changed. Golden light rose from his back.

Luo Tian’s body slightly bent. On his back, a golden “罪” character slowly glowed. An immense pressure rose from the character, causing people to gasp in shock. Even the six domain masters were moved.

“Why did the heavenly law suddenly appear?” Zheng Xin and others showed strong shock. They couldn’t understand why Luo Tian’s heavenly law, which had never caused trouble before, suddenly erupted now.

“Damn! It’s Zhu Ge Huangchao!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed. After a brief thought, he figured out the situation.

Though Zhu Ge Huangchao had been defeated by him, the heavenly law within those blue lightning bolts remained in his body. Now that he was using martial arts, the heavenly law also moved with it, resonating with the “罪” character on his back.

Yan Hongtao stopped moving. His blood-red figure stood before him, face filled with confusion but he didn’t attack. This match was not one of unfairness; if it were usual assassination, he would have attacked without hesitation. After all, assassins only cared about results.

The golden “罪” character was clearly missing a stroke. But with the heavenly law from the blue lightning added, it became complete. The immense pressure made Luo Tian’s face pale.

“Get out of the way!” Luo Tian shouted, his voice booming. The Great Dao power spread to resist the heavenly law’s suppression.

“Hum…” Though the Great Dao power was rebellious, it was still no match for heavenly law. It only lasted a moment before being completely shattered by the golden “罪” character.

“Hum…” The golden character slowly fell, imprinting itself on Luo Tian’s back again. This made Luo Tian’s face pale slightly.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian hadn’t suffered any real damage. After all, the seal of the Era Book was still in place. However, due to the torn corner of the heavenly law seal being resealed, Luo Tian could no longer sense any spiritual energy.

Recently, Luo Tian’s cultivation had been slowly rising. Though it was slow, it was steadily increasing. With the “罪” character becoming complete again, Luo Tian returned to his previous state. If there were no other methods, he would forever remain at the late-stage Saint level.

“Unfortunately!” The six domain masters showed admiration, watching Luo Tian gradually recover. They knew if Luo Tian had no extraordinary opportunities, he would never have a chance to rise.

“Continue!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. His gaze turned to Yan Hongtao, his voice calm. This was the best outcome he could think of, within his acceptance range.

Yan Hongtao showed a hint of admiration. He couldn’t imagine if he were in Luo Tian’s position, whether he would have a chance to survive. The impact of the golden “罪” character was too great.

People around also showed sympathy, but admiration as well. They gazed at Luo Tian, though they had heard before that he was suppressed by heavenly law, now seeing the golden “罪” character’s immense pressure, they couldn’t help but admire Luo Tian’s mindset.

“After a hundred years, Luo Tian will still be at the late-stage Saint. These peers might have already reached the peak of saints!” People sighed inwardly, regretful. A prodigy who should have been the brightest in this era ended up like this.

“Don’t worry. I won’t take advantage of you. Since you’re suppressed by heavenly law, your body and spiritual power are definitely not at their peak. But your soul is!” Yan Hongtao’s eyes gleamed, his blood-red figure moving his hands.

“Shura Hell!” Yan Hongtao’s voice echoed, and the blood-red figure radiated strange energy, filling the entire barrier.

A chilling sensation immediately spread into people’s minds. Cold air, even through the barrier, could be felt.

Roars echoed to the heavens. Blood-red creatures flew out from Yan Hongtao’s body, like demons emerging from hell. They stood around the barrier, their bloodlight flashing and enveloping it.

At the same time, Yan Hongtao’s body released a grey soul. It combined with the blood-red figure to form a blood-red Yan Hongtao. Yan Hongtao’s physical body, however, stood still with his eyes closed.

Luo Tian’s eyes flickered. When Yan Hongtao unleashed his technique, Luo Tian felt his soul wanted to escape from his body uncontrollably. But he firmly suppressed it within himself.

“Come on, let’s fight with souls alone! No need for bodies or spiritual power!” The blood-red Yan Hongtao looked at Luo Tian.

“Good!” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate. He released his suppressed soul, golden in color, contrasting sharply with the black qi around him.

“Shura Hell? Yan Hongtao is confident in his soul!” The six domain masters showed admiration, gazing at Yan Hongtao.

“Luo Tian’s soul is also strong. Looking at both of them, it seems this match will end in a draw! Soul battles are dangerous. We mustn’t be careless; if someone dies, it would be bad!” Biao Yuanshan spoke, his eyes filled with concern.

Chapter 1089: An Unusual Battle ()

On the demon clan’s arena, two souls—golden and red—appeared in people’s sight. On the ground, Luo Tian and Yan Hongtao’s physical bodies stood motionless, as if in a trance.

“Fighting with souls is fair, isn’t it?” Yan Hongtao spoke, his voice filled with confidence.

“Fair enough,” Luo Tian replied. Yan Hongtao didn’t know that heavenly law’s suppression affected both body and soul. But Luo Tian didn’t mention it, as he believed it was the same for both.

“Kill!” Under people’s astonished gazes, Yan Hongtao’s blood-red soul rushed toward Luo Tian. His speed was even faster than before, his hands moving with immense spiritual power to attack Luo Tian.

Luo Tian remained fearless. He had never feared anyone in soul battles. His golden hands moved, pushing forth fierce spiritual power. The Soul Sealing Seal flew from his hands.

“Soul technique?” Yan Hongtao showed a hint of surprise but quickly regained composure. His blood-red fist struck, colliding with the Soul Sealing Seal.

The thunderous impact echoed. The wild fluctuations were no less intense than their previous physical clashes, and even more dangerous. A single mistake could result in death.

“Soul Severing Technique!” Yan Hongtao roared, his spiritual power forming a blood-red sword. It sliced toward Luo Tian’s soul.

This sword was terrifying, as if it could sever everything. If Luo Tian were struck, even his powerful soul would be split in two, and the outcome would be decided.

“Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist, Heaven-Devouring Attack!” Luo Tian’s spiritual power spread. A golden figure formed into an indestructible warrior, using the Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist and Heaven-Devouring Attack to clash with Yan Hongtao.

The thunderous impact echoed. Golden fists collided with blood-red swords, sending invisible fluctuations beyond their souls.

A trickle of blood flowed from both men’s mouths. Obviously, their souls were wounded; their physical bodies also suffered injuries.

“Kill!” Yan Hongtao roared, his blood-red soul sword continuously moving. It sliced toward Luo Tian without end.

Luo Tian was equally fierce, using the Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist and Invincibility Against All Techniques. No matter how terrifying Yan Hongtao’s blood-red sword was, Luo Tian would break it with a single punch.

“I feel like these two are fighting for their lives!” People were shocked by the danger of their battle. Each collision sent shivers down their spines. Their physical bodies also trembled, injuries growing heavier.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” Under Luo Tian’s Great Dao Sealing Demon Fist and Heaven-Devouring Attack, Yan Hongtao gradually couldn’t withstand. His blood-red soul dimmed, his eyes showing fatigue.

“Final move: Shura Exile!” Yan Hongtao’s face twisted. He used an ultimate secret technique. His blood-red figure moved his hands, and a streak of bloodlight shot from his hands. It tore through the sky, as if connecting to another world. Blood qi poured out from the spatial rift, and ghostly cries echoed.

“This is a Shura Domain secret technique. It seals people into another space!” Someone gasped, recognizing Yan Hongtao’s method.

The six domain masters showed shock. Biao Yuanshan slightly moved his body, locking his gaze on Luo Tian. If anything unexpected happened, he would intervene immediately.

“Earlier when I fought him, Yan Hongtao held back!” Sun Feiwen showed bitterness. He watched the spatial rift that connected to hell, speaking softly.

“I’m damned! Luo Tian is in danger now. Unless his soul returns to his body, this space will be fatal!” People murmured, their eyes filled with strong shock as they watched Yan Hongtao.

The blood-red soul dimmed further. Obviously, maintaining the spatial rift was a great strain on Yan Hongtao.

“Enter!” Yan Hongtao roared, ignoring his dimming soul. He pressed his hands to emit blood-red seals, wrapping Luo Tian.

“Hum…” The blood-red seals imprinted onto Luo Tian’s soul. In the next moment, Luo Tian’s soul seemed uncontrollable, rushing toward the spatial rift.

“Don’t enter!” Luo Tian’s heart trembled. He felt the immense danger from the spatial rift. His soul power surged.

“Return!” Luo Tian continuously swung his fists to resist the massive pull, but he soon realized it was futile. The pull came from his soul itself; there was no way to break free.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian watched his soul approaching the blood-filled spatial rift. His heart grew more anxious.

“Hundred feet… Ten feet…” In an instant, Luo Tian was only ten feet away from the spatial rift.

“I’ll definitely come out!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cold determination. He spoke to Yan Hongtao, his voice filled with absolute resolve. He stopped resisting and flew into the chaotic space.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian no longer resisted, his soul instantly vanished from people’s sight.

“He entered!” People gasped, watching Luo Tian enter the spatial rift.

“Grandpa, hurry and help!” Biao Dezhu shouted at Biao Yuanshan. Only the six of them could save Luo Tian now.

“Wait a bit longer!” Biao Yuanshan transmitted to Biao Dezhu and the others. His gaze was fixed on the spatial rift that had already closed.

“Done! Luo Tian is done!” People watched the closing spatial rift. They knew Luo Tian was doomed unless the six above intervened.

“There’s still some time; I can still sense this space!” Biao Yuanshan showed a serious expression, his gaze on the void.

“Ended!” Yan Hongtao smiled slightly. He felt his opened space gradually disappearing, speaking softly.

“Why hasn’t Biao Yuanshan intervened?” People showed confusion, their eyes on Biao Yuanshan.

“Biao Yuanshan, why haven’t you intervened? If not, I’ll act. It’s simple—just the Era Book from the Beast Domain!” Yan Hongtao smiled, speaking to Biao Yuanshan.

Yan Hongtao naturally didn’t believe the Era Book was with Luo Tian. He knew Luo Tian couldn’t protect it; such an item would definitely be on Biao Yuanshan.

“No need for your trouble!” Biao Yuanshan coldly replied. His gaze remained fixed on the void, fearing that even a moment’s distraction would make him lose track of Luo Tian’s space.

At this time, Luo Tian was in an unknown space. His eyes showed solemnity as he felt his soul seemed to be drifting away.

But soon, Luo Tian suddenly widened his eyes. He could clearly feel he was moving further from his physical body.

“Go!” Thinking of this, Luo Tian transformed into golden light. He flew toward his physical body using their connection.

“Roar…” But just as Luo Tian hadn’t flown far, a low roar echoed. It seemed another soul trapped in this space had discovered Luo Tian’s presence and rushed toward him, roaring.

“Kid, you’re new?” Thoughts echoed in the bloodspace. Luo Tian’s nerves tensed instantly.
