When Luo Tian saw the three great seals fused together into one massive seal in Luotian's hand, his heart surged with waves of astonishment.

At that moment, everyone could feel the immense power radiating from both men's seals above them. If they collided, without the protection of the Qinxin Sect's mountain-restraining array, the sect would be reduced to ruins! Even the residual shockwaves from their collision would affect many nearby people.

"Hmm?" Luo Tian's eyes flashed like lightning, his gaze fixed on the power of Luotian's celestial-level martial technique. He was surprised to find it nearly matched his own. A bold idea suddenly surfaced in his mind.

Luo Tian had always acted on impulse, and upon conceiving this audacious plan, his eyes gleamed with curiosity.

Seeing Luo Tian remain motionless, Luotian stood atop the sky, his head crowned with the "Concave Seal," waiting for Luo Tian's next move.

"What is he planning now?" Jiang Yuansheng observed Luo Tian's excited expression, a sense of unease creeping into his mind.

Luo Tian wore a smile as his formidable spiritual awareness concentrated on a faint wisp of gray gas within his golden soul.

"I wonder if adding a touch of chaos power would enhance its strength further," Luo Tian mused, his powerful spiritual awareness solidifying into an actual blade of spiritual essence. He slashed at the minuscule chaos power atop his golden soul.

Seeming to sense it was Luo Tian's spiritual awareness, the infinitesimal chaos power offered no resistance and was severed effortlessly.

"Did it work?" Luo Tian's mind reeled in disbelief, stunned by the sudden success. This left him unprepared for a prolonged battle.

Yet he did not hesitate, swiftly enveloping the invisible chaos power with his spiritual awareness and guiding it through his meridians until it materialized in his hand.

The moment the gray mist appeared, both Luo Tian and Luotian's seals trembled slightly, as if subjects encountering their sovereign.

"What is this kid doing?" Ren Hongzhi and the others wore puzzled expressions, their gazes fixed on Luo Tian. Only the four elders of the sect noticed the gray mist on his hand.

"Is that—!"
"Chaos power!" Jiang Yuansheng and the others were stunned, their previously calm gazes now filled with shock. They stared at Luo Tian in disbelief.

Chaos power—none of the four elders possessed it. Yet this young Zhang Daotian now held a fragment, albeit far less than masters like Sichu Chen or Murong Cheng. Still, this was enough to leave Jiang Yuansheng and the others in awe.

As Jiang Yuansheng's group remained stunned, Luo Tian let out a light laugh and infused the fragment of chaos power into the massive seal formed by the fusion of three martial arts techniques in the sky.

In an instant, the infinitesimal chaos power surged into the seal, as if igniting something. The entire seal turned gray, radiating an overwhelming aura that darkened the sky.

Luotian's seal trembled under this terrifying fluctuation, nearly collapsing if not for his desperate efforts. Even before Luo Tian's gray seal, it seemed on the verge of breaking apart.

"What is this thing!" The disciples of Qinxin Sect trembled with fear, their legs shaking as they felt the terrifying pressure from the gray seal. They longed to flee but felt an overwhelming helplessness.

"I've gone too far!" Luo Tian's heart quaked with fear as the gray seal exuded wild, uncontrollable energy. It had surpassed his control, leaving him trembling in awe.

Jiang Yuansheng and the other four elders—masters at the魂凝 (Soul Consolidation) realm—possessed superior perception.

"Zhang Daotian, you little bastard! Stop this right now!"
"You damn fool, stop immediately! I'll agree to your marriage with Biyue!" Jiang Yuansheng and the others shouted desperately, their faces etched with anxiety.

Even Jiang Yuansheng felt the terrifying aura. If this seal manifested fully, he would suffer severe damage.

"Boom..." The overwhelming pressure intensified. Under this force, Luotian's "Concave Seal" finally crumbled like a clown, disintegrating into swirling spiritual energy that rushed toward Luo Tian's gray seal.

"Zhang Daotian, you little bastard! You're not here to duel—you're trying to annihilate the sect!" Jiang Yuansheng wept bitterly, watching the increasingly terrifying seal. He regretted his decision to agree to this marriage.

He knew that even if he could withstand the seal, it would obliterate Qinxin Sect entirely.

"I wish I could stop!" Luo Tian's mind screamed desperately, but he found himself powerless to halt the apocalyptic seal.

"What in hell did I create!" Luo Tian cursed inwardly, discovering to his horror that his own spiritual energy was also draining into the seal at an alarming rate.

The disciples of Qinxin Sect and Ren Hongzhi finally realized the danger. Seeing Luo Tian's bitter smile, they understood: Zhang Daotian had gone too far.

"Run! Get as far away as you can!" Jiang Yuansheng's voice echoed through Qinxin Sect, laced with urgency.

As Jiang Yuansheng bellowed, the four elders behind him unleashed一道道 formidable barriers, encircling Qinxin Sect.

"Senior, if you don't come out soon, Qinxin Sect will be destroyed!" Jiang Yuansheng shouted toward the sect's depths.

Chapter 632: Mutual Destruction

Hearing Jiang Yuansheng's roar, Qinxin Sect's disciples panicked, scrambling to flee. Yet their legs refused to move beneath the gray seal's oppressive presence.

Luo Tian broke out in cold sweat, his heart trembling as the gray seal continuously drained his spiritual energy.

"Stop staring and run!" Luo Tian weakly urged Zheng Xin and Ren Zhiyuan, his face etched with regret.

He never imagined that a simple inspiration would unleash such catastrophic consequences. The gray seal clearly disobeyed him; if it exploded, not only would he die, but Gu Qianshui and Zheng Xin—entire Qinxin Sect—would perish with him.

"What the hell is this thing? I just added a bit of chaos power, why is it so intense!" Luo Tian's mind seethed. His spiritual energy was finally drained, leaving him powerless as he plummeted toward the ground.

"You little bastard! You and your disciple are both bastards!" Jiang Yuansheng nearly wept, cursing repeatedly while emitting intense fluctuations. He unleashed wave after wave of barriers to protect Qinxin Sect.

"Ten... a hundred... a thousand..." Jiang Yuansheng and the other three elders broke out in cold sweat, having conjured over a thousand barriers within moments.

At the same time, three more figures soared from Qinxin Sect—venerable elders at魂凝 (Soul Consolidation) realm. Cursing, they flew toward Jiang Yuansheng's group, joining his four elders.

"Boom..." Luo Tian landed awkwardly on the ground, his face twisted in bitterness. He had no strength left, only watching helplessly as the gray seal absorbed spiritual energy from the heavens.

A massive vortex of spiritual energy rose again over Qinxin Sect, far more intense than the previous "Concave Seal" from Luotian.

The wind howled over Tian Dao Sect, nearly sucking Luo Tian into it. Others swayed unsteadily.

"It's over! You've doomed us, Luo Tian! You monster!" Zheng Xin's face contorted in pain as he gazed at Luo Tian, who had fallen to the ground. He longed to fly toward him but found his movements agonizingly slow.

Gu Qianshui, exerting all her strength, flew to Luo Tian's side, her face softening as she transferred spiritual energy into him.

"Forgive me, Qianshui!" Luo Tian smiled bitterly after absorbing her energy, his eyes filled with deep regret.

"It's okay. Being with you in death is enough for me," Gu Qianshui replied, her face serene. She leaned into Luo Tian's embrace without fear, instead finding peace.

Cold Qiuchan, still unconscious, saw Gu Qianshui in Luo Tian's arms. A bewildered ache stirred within her heart, growing stronger with each moment. She felt an inexplicable sense of jealousy she couldn't explain.

The seal above ignored the group's emotions, continuing to devour spiritual energy from the heavens with insatiable hunger. It drained all spiritual energy within a thousand miles of Qinxin Sect.

"Buzz..." A piercing hum echoed in people's ears, though the barriers muffled it slightly. Some disciples at the spiritual essence realm felt their minds shaken, with some even spitting blood.

"It's about to explode!" Jiang Yuansheng's face paled, his eyes filled with terror as he gazed at the gray seal.

Under people's terrified gazes, the gray seal slowly pressed down on Qinxin Sect's towering mountain. Its target was clearly Luotian's position.

Luotian now regretted his actions deeply, wishing he hadn't provoked this madman. His regret deepened as the seal's terrifying pressure bore down on him.

"Damn it!" Luotian cursed inwardly, spitting blood as the overwhelming pressure crushed him. His body emitted a series of cracking sounds.

"Senior, if you don't come out soon, Qinxin Sect will be destroyed!" Jiang Yuansheng and the seven other魂凝 (Soul Consolidation) elders shouted desperately toward Qinxin Sect's depths.

In an instant, the gray seal collided with the nearly two thousand barriers they had set up.

"Boom!" The deafening explosion echoed through the heavens, breaking through the barriers. The massive mushroom cloud engulfed Jiang Yuansheng and others outside the barriers.

The barriers, however, shattered like paper—layer after layer—leaving Qinxin Sect's disciples in despair.

The mere explosion had already caused Luo Tian and others to spit blood, their faces pale. Some disciples collapsed on the ground, vomiting blood mixed with internal organs.

"This is really over!" Luo Tian could feel death approaching. The two thousand barriers had dwindled to eight hundred, and they were still breaking at a terrifying rate.

"You bastard! I'll haunt you in hell!" Jiang Lerong's face turned pale, her eyes burning with hatred toward Luo Tian.

In this world, Jiang Lerong had lived happily as Qinxin Sect's first genius. Her appearance, once unattractive in this world, had improved—though not stunningly beautiful, it was enough for her.

But all of this was destroyed by Luo Tian. Not only did he destroy it, but now she would die with him. This hatred for Luo Tian had reached its peak.

Luo Tian tightly held Gu Qianshui, his face calm as he sighed: "I'm sorry!"

He said that and closed his eyes, savoring the warmth in his arms as if trying to preserve it.

"Wife... I'm sorry! I'll go first, okay? Luo Tian, you bastard, you've really ruined me! I wonder if my soul will be annihilated in this explosion? Father, I'm not filial... Mother..." Zheng Xin no longer cared about revealing his identity, muttering endlessly.

"Shut up! You're annoying me!" Yu Mingxue's transformed form kicked Zheng Xin, her face equally grim.

"Ten layers... eight layers..." Under people's complex gazes, the fragile barriers finally shattered to eight layers, signaling death's arrival.

"Si Tuchen, your disciple caused this mess—won't you come out to fix it?" At this critical moment, a voice echoed in their ears, bringing hope to Qinxin Sect's disciples.

Chapter 633: The Deterrent Luo Tian

"Ha! I thought you wouldn't show up!" The old voice echoed, followed by another familiar voice that made Luo Tian and Ren Hongzhi's faces light up. They gazed at the barriers' exterior.

But the massive mushroom cloud obscured their vision, even rendering spiritual awareness useless.

As two voices echoed, the explosion's force slightly paused. Si Tuchen appeared before Luo Tian, his face showing approval and satisfaction. Another old figure also emerged into view.

"Senior Ancestor!" Qinxin Sect's disciples' faces lit up with joy, but they couldn't bow.

Si Tuchen and the Qinxin Sect's elder both moved their hands, creating a terrifying suction force.

At the same time, the seven Qinxin Sect elders' barriers shattered, and the explosion's force surged toward Luo Tian.

But what stunned Luo Tian was that this destructive energy had no effect on Si Tuchen and the elder. Instead, it seemed to become a docile lamb under their suction force, converging toward them.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian finally regained his composure, wiping blood from his lips as he stared in awe at Si Tuchen and the elder.

"Is this what it means to grasp a fragment of chaos power?" Luo Tian mused, his eyes filled with envy.

"Too变态! Such a terrifying explosion was so easily neutralized by two elders!" Zheng Xin and others were equally stunned.

Qinxin Sect's disciples gazed at their sect's elder with admiration, shouting loudly.

An hour passed quietly. Under Si Tuchen and the Qinxin Sect elder's absorption, the terrifying fluctuation finally condensed in their hands.

Then, Luo Tian and others' vision cleared, and they all gasped at the sight above.

The sky over Qinxin Sect was filled with an endless expanse of blackness, people knew it was due to the void being torn open.

As Si Tuchen and the elder absorbed, the endless void began to slowly heal, though at a painfully slow pace.

Si Tuchen and the elder sent the condensed terrifying energy into the void, then moved their hands slightly. Two wisps of gray gas emerged from their hands, swirling around the black void like thin threads.

With the gray gas's emergence, the torn void rapidly healed under Luo Tian and others' astonished gazes.

Tian Dao Sect's disciples collapsed in droves, even Meng Cheng was no exception. The explosion had been so terrifying it felt like death's approach, leaving people desperate.

Then, people's gazes turned wary toward Luo Tian, their hearts aching as they couldn't fathom that this youth had created such an explosion.

"You little bastard, always causing trouble for me!" Si Tuchen's face showed anger as he smacked Luo Tian's head, but his eyes held a hint of joy.

"Cough... cough..." As Si Tuchen scolded Luo Tian, a series of violent coughs echoed from the sky.

The void tore open, revealing Jiang Yuansheng and others' figures, causing Qinxin Sect's disciples to twitch even more.

At this moment, Jiang Yuansheng and the seven elders wore blackened faces, their robes torn and ragged. They were in a pitiful state.

Their figures appeared in the sky, their gazes toward Luo Tian and Si Tuchen filled with resentment.

They had been at the top of Qinxin Sect for thousands of years, never before so pitiful. Now, due to Luo Tian's actions, their image was ruined. Though they weren't physically harmed, the humiliation was unbearable.

Especially when looking at Si Tuchen and their sect's leader, they cursed inwardly: "You could have come earlier. Why let us fight? You scared us half to death and made us look foolish!"

Qinxin Sect's disciples, seeing Jiang Yuansheng's group, wore expressions of disbelief. Their gazes toward Luo Tian were filled with awe—only someone as powerful as this could make the elders so pitiful.

Luo Tian, seeing the fearful gazes around him, shook his head. That explosion had indeed been massive, but he couldn't unleash it again; otherwise, his life would be over.

"Ha! Jiang Xiong, you've worked hard!" Si Baishan wore an apology but his eyes gleamed with pride as he looked at Jiang Baiyuan, clearly delighted.

Seeing Si Tuchen's gaze, Jiang Baiyuan's lungs nearly exploded with anger, but recalling his previous words and Luo Tian's displayed strength, he could only gasp heavily without speaking.

"Xu Xiong, it's been years! Your strength has increased significantly!" Si Tuchen smiled and addressed Qinxin Sect's first elder.

"Where? Your strength is what truly astonishes me! Now you've become a master who grasps a fragment of chaos power!" Qinxin Sect's first elder Xu Dewei expressed admiration.

"Fortuitous," Si Tuchen replied politely, then turned his gaze to Jiang Yuansheng.

"Old Jiang, you have no objections now that the two kids' matter is settled, right?" Si Tuchen approached Jiang Yuansheng and waved his hand. Jiang Yuansheng immediately returned to his previous state, leaving everyone in awe.

"Hmph!" Jiang Yuansheng was stunned by Si Tuchen's technique but let out a cold snort, then nodded slightly.

"Jiang Ancestor, you said that Zhang Daotian must defeat Qinxin Sect's geniuses to agree to this marriage. Did you forget about me?" As Jiang Yuansheng nodded, Jiang Lerong smiled and gazed coldly at Luo Tian.

"Hmm?" Si Tuchen's gaze turned slightly cold, turning to Jiang Lerong and frowning.

"What?" Jiang Yuansheng hadn't expected that after Luo Tian's display, someone would still dare to challenge him.

"Interesting!" Xu Dewei had already healed all of Tian Dao Sect's disciples. Hearing Jiang Lerong's words, he wore a curious expression and looked at his disciple Li Menglian.

Xu Dewei smiled, gazing at Li Menglian. He knew his disciple, though outwardly a woman, possessed an indomitable spirit no less than men.

Chapter 634: Battle Against Jiang Lerong

Si Tuchen frowned at Jiang Lerong, snorting, "Your elder has already agreed. What qualification do you have as a junior to speak here?"

"Senior, your words are mistaken. I merely saw Zhang Senior's overwhelming strength and wished to spar a bit. If Zhang Senior dares not, it's no problem; I have no complaints!" Jiang Lerong smiled at Luo Tian but her eyes held coldness, even a hint of killing intent.

"Good!"
"It's truly worthy of Li Senior Sister!" Qinxin Sect's disciples cheered, their gazes filled with fervor as they looked at the plain-faced Jiang Lerong.

Qinxin Sect's disciples felt bitter, their sect's genius had been trampled one by one. Even the entire sect nearly destroyed by Luo Tian.

If it weren't for Xu Dewei's intervention, that explosion would have caused massive losses, even the annihilation of Qinxin Sect. No one below魂凝 (Soul Consolidation) would have survived.

Thus, Qinxin Sect's disciples were angry at Luo Tian but constrained by his strength. No one in the sect could match him now.

But Jiang Lerong had stepped forward. In Qinxin Sect, she was hailed as the first genius with no defeats. This rekindled the disciples' hopes.

Luo Tian would definitely not unleash that terrifying technique again; it was suicidal. In the disciples' eyes, Luo Tian was strong but still lagged behind Li Menglian's level without that terrifying martial art.

"Zhang Daotian, dare you?" Qinxin Sect's disciples roared, their gazes challenging Luo Tian.

Luo Tian ignored others' mockery and stared directly at Jiang Lerong. His condition was slightly poor, but with the fragment of chaos power Si Tuchen had planted on his golden soul, he recovered at an absurd speed.

"Who's afraid?" Luo Tian spoke loudly, giving Si Tuchen and Zheng Xin a reassuring glance. He smiled at Jiang Lerong.

"Good, I'll teach you for blocking us before!" Luo Tian inwardly sneered. Killing Jiang Lerong was impossible, but teaching her a lesson was no problem.

"Indeed bold! I don't know how you've improved so quickly, but it's fitting your genius title!" Jiang Lerong's battle spirit flared. She also knew they couldn't decide life or death here, but she simply couldn't stand Luo Tian's success.

"Enough, you young people, don't harm your relations!" Si Tuchen shook his head, not wanting to interfere with his disciple's decision. He waved his hand, and a circular barrier appeared, transporting Luo Tian and Jiang Lerong into it.

"Alright, there's no need for polite words between us! Begin!" Jiang Lerong's face showed coldness. Her aura surged instantly, emitting a spirit-embodiment stage energy that pressed against Luo Tian.

"You really are an annoying woman!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed coldly, launching a four-color rainbow streak toward Jiang Lerong.

They were enemies, and soon clashed under people's gazes. Luo Tian was no longer the soul-peak stage Luo Tian, and Jiang Lerong had also improved to spirit-embodiment stage. However, she was only slightly stronger in terms of cultivation. Other aspects didn't give her an advantage.

Jiang Lerong had prepared, but she was still stunned by Luo Tian's strength. She hadn't expected him to grow so much in such a short time.

They clashed like water and fire, their attacks ruthless. If they couldn't block each other's strikes, both would end up severely injured.

"Are they acquainted? Why do I feel like they're mortal enemies?" People wore puzzled expressions, watching their relentless combat.

Luo Tian and Jiang Lerong ignored others' gazes, punches colliding. Luo Tian unleashed a "Destruction" and "Rebirth" punch repeatedly toward Jiang Lerong.

Jiang Lerong, however, remained calm. Her fists radiated strange fluctuations that unaffected by Luo Tian's "Destruction" and "Rebirth" powers. She moved effortlessly, leaving Luo Tian astonished.

"This damned woman is really a thorn in my side!" Luo Tian was startled but grinned with excitement. He hadn't faced an equal opponent in a long time, and fighting Jiang Lerong was exhilarating.

"Unity with Heaven and Humanity!" Luo Tian, excited, closed his eyes, emitting a calm aura like still water. He launched a punch.

"Hmm? Why did Daotian close his eyes?" Ren Hongzhi and others wore expressions of disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian with closed eyes.

"Is he entering Unity with Heaven and Humanity?" Si Tuchen's lips curled slightly, his gaze filled with satisfaction toward Luo Tian.

No one had entered the Unity with Heaven and Humanity stage, not even Si Tuchen. Only those with profound understanding of martial arts could achieve it.

"He won't enter Unity with Heaven and Humanity, will he?" Jiang Yuansheng and the other elders speculated. They were ancient beings with vast experience, so they guessed Luo Tian's reason for closing his eyes.

"Yes, it is Unity with Heaven and Humanity!" Si Tuchen's face showed pride as he looked at Jiang Yuansheng and Xu Dewei.

Hearing Si Tuchen's confirmation, the Qinxin Sect elders wore surprise, then admiration as they gazed at Si Tuchen. They envied his outstanding disciple.

"Idiot!" Jiang Lerong ignored everything, mocking Luo Tian's closed eyes and striking harder.

"Boom..." A shocking sight appeared, even leaving Si Tuchen's lips twitching as he watched their battle.

A dull sound echoed from Luo Tian's shoulder, Jiang Lerong's fist had smashed into it, sending him flying backward. Blood splattered in the sky as Luo Tian collided with Si Tuchen's barrier.

"Damn it, I didn't enter!" Luo Tian cursed loudly, his wood-element spiritual energy repairing the fractured bones and wounds on his shoulder. He used "Fengtian Step" to narrowly dodge Jiang Lerong's foot.

"Boom..." Jiang Lerong's kick missed, slamming into the barrier and shaking it violently.

"Li Senior Sister is invincible!" Most Qinxin Sect disciples hadn't seen how they fought, but the result was clear—Luo Tian had collided with the barrier and clearly lost. They cheered loudly.

"Daotian, what's wrong? You could have held your ground but why do this?" Ren Hongzhi and others wore puzzled expressions.

"Ha..." Si Tuchen was speechless, watching his disciple. His confidence in showing off had been shattered by Luo Tian's failure to enter Unity with Heaven and Humanity, leaving his old face embarrassed.

"Ha... it's normal, no one can enter immediately!" Si Tuchen chuckled lightly, his face calm.

"Boom..." But as soon as Si Tuchen's words finished, Luo Tian's figure collided with the barrier again. Blood trickled from his lips, causing Qinxin Sect disciples to cheer loudly once more.

"Senior Tuchen's outstanding disciple truly has exceptional talent!" Jiang Yuansheng and the other elders smiled, gazing at Si Tuchen.

"Little bastard! If you don't enter Unity with Heaven and Humanity today, your master's face will be ruined!" Si Tuchen saw their mocking gazes at Luo Tian's closed eyes and muttered inwardly.

Though Si Tuchen was anxious, he didn't transmit to Luo Tian because he knew Unity with Heaven and Humanity was a stage. The more pressure, the harder it was to enter.

"Boom..." Luo Tian's figure collided with the barrier again, his eyes filled with confusion—uncertain if he could enter.

"Maybe I can only enter once on the Rebirth Bridge?" Luo Tian opened his eyes, thinking. He blocked Jiang Lerong's attack with a punch.

At this moment, Luo Tian had sustained some minor injuries and was unrecognizable.

"Idiot! Unity with Heaven and Humanity isn't that easy to enter. If it were, the world would be full of martial arts geniuses!" Jiang Lerong sneered, her voice filled with endless mockery.

"I won't believe it!" Luo Tian closed his eyes again, rushing toward Jiang Lerong's mocking face.

"One... two..." Luo Tian repeatedly rushed forward, repeatedly closed his eyes, but each time was more pitiful. His wounds increased under Jiang Lerong's attacks.

"Ha... Senior Tuchen, your outstanding disciple's determination is truly admirable. It reminds me of your style!"
"Yes! You were also a stubborn person back then!" The Qinxin Sect elders no longer believed Luo Tian could enter Unity with Heaven and Humanity. They mocked Si Tuchen, their gazes filled with mockery.

Si Tuchen's face was silent. Seeing Luo Tian's wounds, he felt both pain and admiration, as if seeing his younger self.

"Hmph! My disciple isn't like me. In less than a century, my disciple will definitely become a Soul Consolidation master!" Si Tuchen coldly replied.

The Qinxin Sect elders, seeing Si Tuchen's silence, stopped talking. After all, Luo Tian's previous strength was there. Si Tuchen's words weren't false. But like the Qinxin Sect disciples, they felt some resentment. Seeing the master and disciple suffer, they couldn't help but mock.

"Ha! Li Senior Sister is truly invincible!" Qinxin Sect disciples cheered, watching Luo Tian repeatedly get knocked back.

"Alas..." Gu Qianshui stood behind the elders, her face showing concern. She sighed, gazing intently at Luo Tian being knocked back repeatedly.

Yu Mingxue's face was puzzled. Each time Luo Tian was knocked back, her heart inexplicably tightened.

"What's wrong with me?" Yu Mingxue's face was grim, gazing at Luo Tian. She wanted to look away but couldn't help being drawn by his determined eyes each time he opened them.

Gu Qianshui sensed Yu Mingxue's unease, her face showing concern: "Senior Sister? What's wrong?"

"Ah... nothing..." Yu Mingxue quickly shook her head, hiding her panic and embarrassment.

"This is my senior sister's man! Why am I..." Yu Mingxue couldn't meet Gu Qianshui's gaze, repeatedly reminding herself.

"I'm feeling unwell, I'll go back first!" Yu Mingxue informed Gu Qianshui before hurriedly flying toward her pavilion.

Gu Qianshui furrowed her brows, sensing something from her senior sister. Intuitively, she felt that her senior sister might have had a connection with Luo Tian on the Tianyuan Continent.

"Hmph! If that's true, I'll deal with you!" Gu Qianshui sneered, gazing at Luo Tian within the barrier.

Luo Tian's condition was terrible, his face pale. Though Jiang Lerong's attacks didn't harm him fundamentally, he had been hit over a hundred times in a short while. Though his body was strong, Jiang Lerong wasn't harmless. The hundred punches had caused him significant injuries.

"I was wrong. Unity with Heaven and Humanity emphasizes following nature, stillness, and sensing!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with brilliance, showing enlightenment.

Finally, Luo Tian stopped attacking and stood still in the sky, his eyes slightly closed, his face calm. His entire being radiated a tranquil aura, like a still lake.

"Ha..." Jiang Lerong sneered, then appeared before Luo Tian. Her fist radiated powerful fluctuations, aiming for his abdomen.

"Ah?" Seeing Jiang Lerong's target, Si Tuchen's brows furrowed slightly.

The abdomen was a critical area for cultivators, as the elixir field—most important to them—was located there. Though Jiang Lerong's attack seemed accidental, it was a direct strike at Luo Tian's elixir field. This made Si Tuchen anxious.

"Hundred zhang... forty zhang..." Jiang Lerong, seeing Luo Tian motionless, felt joy.

After battling for so long, she had prepared this punch to destroy Luo Tian's cultivation. She was confident that this strike would appear accidental, given the previous hundred attacks.

Jiang Lerong instantly arrived before Luo Tian and launched her punch.

But soon, she was startled. Her plot was about to succeed; even her fist felt contact with Luo Tian when a strong hand seized it.

In an instant, a powerful foot kicked Jiang Lerong's chest, showing no regard for her being a woman.
