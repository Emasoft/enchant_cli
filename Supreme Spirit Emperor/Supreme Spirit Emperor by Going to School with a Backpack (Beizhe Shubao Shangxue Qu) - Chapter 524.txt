“Ye Sheng!” However, it was better not to have heard Ye Liangchen’s words. Upon hearing the name Ye Sheng, the old man’s eyes immediately flashed with a brilliant light.

“Ye Sheng, that little bastard! Damn it, I was about to find him. Since you’ve come to me, I’ll beat his grandson first!” The old man immediately cursed, showing no regard for his image as a senior cultivator.

“Senior, you are an Immortal King powerhouse. To fight against us mere Celestial Immortals is hardly appropriate, is it?” Luo Tian slowly straightened his posture, his gaze filled with coldness.

“Hum…”, a low hum resonated. The Yin Fish hovered above Luo Tian’s head, and the Shooting Sun Bow and Splitting Heaven Spear were once again grasped by him.

“What is this?” Upon seeing the Yin Fish above Luo Tian’s head, the old man’s eyes narrowed slightly, his expression one of contemplation.

“What is your relationship with the old man? Why do you possess his belongings?” The old man extended a hand, snatching the Yin Fish into his grasp, his expression one of contemplation.

“Luo Tian…” The sharp voice of the Yin Fish echoed in people’s ears, filled with resolve.

“Master, I—I wish to betray my master! I will follow you instead. I’ve had enough of this brat; he’s tricked me for thousands of years!” The Yin Fish’s voice echoed in people’s ears, causing their faces to twist with odd expressions.

Luo Tian’s lips twitched as he listened to the Yin Fish’s voice, his face flushing red. He had not expected the Yin Fish to pull such a move at this moment.

“From now on, you are my master. No one can change my will!” The Yin Fish continued shouting, but the old man’s expression of oddity vanished in an instant.

“Truly despicable!” The old man waved his hand, silencing the Yin Fish’s voice. He then waved his hand again, tossing the Yin Fish back to Luo Tian’s front.

“Go away. Today I’m in a good mood, so I’ll let you off!” The old man spoke softly, then closed his eyes again.

“After so long, why haven’t the people from Huantian City arrived?” People soon became curious. According to past customs, if someone caused trouble in Huantian City, strong cultivators would have arrived long ago. Yet since Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen had fought, no one had come.

“Is this the Luo Tian you were looking for?” The old man addressed Long Youran, causing Luo Tian to startle slightly.

“Ugh…” Long Youran nodded, then gazed at Luo Tian with a nod.

“Since we’ve met, come with me. If you’re disobedient, be careful—I might sell you off!” The old man pointed his finger, and Long Youran immediately regained her freedom.

“Luo Tian!” Long Youran regained her freedom, shouting loudly and rushing toward Luo Tian’s front, her eyes filled with excitement.

“You ran, what's going on?”

“Don’t be afraid. I’m here; no one can bully you, not even an Immortal King!” Luo Tian gently patted Long Youran’s head.

“I wasn’t at home, was I? When I returned to Shenglong Sect, I found it had been destroyed. I tried to teleport to Zhong San Tian to find you, but met this old man who insisted on taking me as his disciple. I refused, and he wore me down with persistence. Eventually, I had no choice but to find you. He said I could wait for you here!” Long Youran spoke loudly, her voice filled with委屈 (sorrow).

“This girl must be crazy!” Upon hearing Long Youran’s words, people around her looked at her as if she were a fool.

An Immortal King powerhouse actively taking you in as a disciple—refusing such an offer would surely cause a stir.

Immortal Kings are all renowned figures. A master from Zhong San Tian would be welcomed as a guest of honor in any sect, even securing a place among the Nine Immortal Mountains.

Yet this Immortal King seemed too pitiful, looking nothing like an Immortal King.

“Ha! Fu Laomo, how have you sunk so low? Chatting with these juniors!” As people murmured低声 (lowly), a loud laugh echoed through the heavens and earth.

“You iron hammer, why haven’t you died yet? Damn it, old bastard!” Upon hearing this cheerful laugh, the old man’s body trembled slightly. He cursed loudly, causing people around him to gape again.

“Hum…” Several figures descended from the sky, standing within people’s sight.

“Elder Brother!”

“Luo Tian!” A deep voice echoed as a tower-like figure approached Luo Tian, his eyes filled with excitement.

“Zhan Biao!” Luo Tian’s eyes lit up. He had not expected Lu Chong to arrive so quickly. At the moment the old man blocked his Splitting Heaven Spear, Luo Tian had known he was no match for the elder. Immediately after, he sent a message to Chen Zhanbiao in Huantian City.

Luo Tian knew Lu Chong’s strength—formidable beyond measure. Though he might not defeat this old beggar, he would certainly reclaim Long Youran.

“You old bastard!”

“You old bastard!” Lu Chong and the old beggar seemed like sworn enemies, rushing toward each other. Both swung their fists at one another.

“Run! An Immortal King is fighting!” People around them turned pale, fleeing in all directions.

“Crack…” A thunderous sound echoed in people’s ears. The two fists collided, causing everyone’s faces to pale.

“Ha!” However, after exchanging a single punch, Lu Chong and the old beggar did not continue fighting. Instead, they clasped hands and laughed heartily.

“Come on, let’s go drink!” Lu Chong laughed loudly, grabbing the old beggar and flying away from people’s sight.

“What in the world is going on?” Everyone stared at them, bewildered. Even Luo Tian’s lips twitched. He had not expected the two to know each other.

“Come here, you young ones!” Lu Chong’s voice echoed in people’s ears, bringing them back to their senses.

“Those were just the ones who recognized Lu Chong. Hurry and chase after him! Lu Chong is elusive, but this chance to meet him was rare. We must beg the master to forge us some weapons!” People shouted loudly, but by the time they realized, Luo Tian and others had already vanished.

……

In Lu’s Ironworks courtyard, two old men sat with large bowls of wine. The aroma of alcohol filled the air as they drank heartily, occasionally laughing loudly.

“Blacksmith! Among us, you’ve done the best. You’ve become the top weapon forge in the Immortal world! Even the Nine Immortal Mountains have to bow to you!” The old beggar grabbed a roasted chicken with his greasy hand and took a few bites, then spoke to Lu Chong.

“Cut the crap. I’m just a blacksmith. Back when we were all fighting on the battlefield, guarding hell, it was more fun. Unfortunately, we’ve grown old. Only Xiao Liu and Xiao Ba remain young!” Lu Chong’s face bore a sigh.

“Don’t talk about it. I heard this hell uprising has started. Xiao Liu’s situation seems bad. I plan to go check on him.” The old beggar’s tone turned serious, his voice filled with sorrow.

“I also heard about it. Be careful. I won’t go. You know why, but tell Xiao Liu hello for me.” Lu Chong spoke softly.

Luo Tian and the others stood behind them, listening to their conversation. They understood the depth of their friendship.

They had all once been generals guarding hell, eight in total. They had fought on the battlefield, instilling fear into countless ghost kings and generals. Later, for unknown reasons, they had gone their separate ways.

“This is my new disciple. You old bastard has so many good things. Give her a high-grade Immortal weapon to protect her!” The old beggar glanced at Long Youran, then spoke to Lu Chong.

“No problem. These are my new disciples; give them some pills!” Lu Chong’s face showed a sly grin as he spoke to the old beggar.

“Damn it, you old bastard. Why did you take in so many disciples?” The old beggar immediately widened his eyes.

“Come on, Zhan Biao, Xue Er. Why are you still standing there? Greet your Uncle Chen! He’s known as the top alchemist in the Immortal world. Just a few pills from him and your strength will improve!” Lu Chong addressed Chen Zhanbiao and Meng Xue.

“Top alchemist in the Immortal world, Jiang Yuansheng!” Upon hearing Lu Chong’s words, Ye Liangchen’s face changed drastically. He immediately rushed to the old beggar’s side and fell to his knees.

“This kid must be crazy. He kneels before anyone…” Diao Dezhu stood beside Luo Tian, slightly sneering.

“Maybe he is…” Luo Tian also smirked. He had experienced the same situation when meeting Jiang Taibai.

Chapter 2010: Heading to Butian City()

“Uncle Chen, my father often mentions you. You are his benefactor. If it weren’t for you, he wouldn’t be where he is now. We are family!”

“Also, Uncle Lu, my father often mentions you. He always talks about you two. You saved his life; we are family too!” Ye Liangchen spoke loudly, his face filled with flattery.

Upon hearing Ye Liangchen’s words, Lu Chong and Jiang Yuansheng’s faces turned grim. Their foreheads twitched with anger, their teeth clenched.

“Ye Sheng, that bastard! It’s strange we two would be so fortunate!” Lu Chong spoke solemnly, his gaze fixed on Ye Liangchen, who he found increasingly distasteful.

“Damn it. That bastard once stole my pills with Jiang Taibai, treating them like candy and nearly devouring all of them. I’ll go find this bastard now!” Jiang Yuansheng also clenched his teeth, his eyes filled with regret.

“Good. I’ve seen him now. This bastard isn’t a good one. He’s just like Ye Sheng!” Jiang Yuansheng spoke loudly, gazing at the kneeling Ye Liangchen.

“Two elders, it’s all a misunderstanding. A complete misunderstanding! I am truly good. In the entire Star River Prefecture, I’m the most kind!” Seeing Lu Chong and Jiang Yuansheng’s fierce eyes as if they wanted to devour him, Ye Liangchen quickly stood up and retreated, smiling at them.

“…” Luo Tian felt speechless. Watching the two furious old men, he sighed inwardly. Ye Liangchen’s uncle must be a real oddity to have driven them into such a state.

Yet Luo Tian hadn’t expected Jiang Taibai, who appeared so upright, to have engaged in such underhanded activities with Ye Sheng.

Time flowed slowly. Lu Chong and Jiang Yuansheng continued recalling the past, occasionally laughing loudly. Luo Tian and others stood by, listening to their stories with admiration.

“Being called the top alchemist in the Immortal world is truly humbling. If that person were still alive, I might not have a place here. Alas!” Jiang Yuansheng spoke with regret.

“Everything has passed. You only lost once. Now that person is gone, there’s no need to dwell on it.” Lu Chong comforted him softly.

“No, some people are always number one!”

“If that person were still alive, perhaps…” Jiang Yuansheng spoke, but was cut off by Lu Chong.

Night fell. Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen left the courtyard, returning to Star River Prefecture. Long Jie, Diao Dezhu, and Long Youran were left behind by Luo Tian.

Under Lu Chong’s repeated assurances, Luo Tian agreed to Long Youran being taken under Jiang Yuansheng’s tutelage. He didn’t know what had drawn Jiang Yuansheng to Long Youran, but being protected by him was surely beneficial for her.

They returned to Star River Prefecture. The seven-day tournament had finally ended, selecting five disciples.

With one day remaining until heading to Butian City, Star River Prefecture’s prodigy Ye Chen emerged from his cultivation retreat. With Ye Chen’s emergence, the ten men guarding hell fully appeared.

These ten were Star River Prefecture’s strongest. However, one person's appearance surprised everyone—Yelang, a name not well known.

Yelang had always been the victim of his family’s bullying. Yet this tournament saw him qualify unexpectedly.

What people envied was that Yelang's tournament seemed always lucky. Either his opponent fell ill and couldn’t participate in the trials, or they were too weak. In any case, he won each match with luck.

Time flowed slowly until the day of heading to Butian City arrived. One by one, Star River Prefecture’s disciples watched the ten people standing on a high platform.

These ten were Star River Prefecture's strongest young talents. As they watched, the ten also exchanged glances.

Dressed in black robes, his eyes like stars, he exuded an air of arrogance. He stood behind Ye Liangchen, gazing at Luo Tian and others.

Ye Chen, Star River Prefecture’s recognized prodigy, was hailed as Ye Tian's successor. No one in Star River Prefecture could match Ye Chen. Even Qiu Qianti had fought him to a draw. However, after Ye Chen’s emergence, his cultivation was at the threshold of an Immortal King. If they fought again, the result would be uncertain.

Ye Chen surveyed everyone before his gaze finally landed on Luo Tian. His brows slightly furrowed, then he smiled at Luo Tian.

Though it was a smile, it still felt stiff. Luo Tian also smiled slightly and nodded in return.

“Everyone, the prodigies, guarding hell. I hope all of Star River Prefecture’s talents will unite and return safely, with no deaths or injuries!” Ye Wudao addressed Luo Tian and others.

The ten then took flight, heading toward Huantian City. They vanished from the sight of Star River Prefecture’s disciples.

“Hope this trial will allow these children to improve!” Ye Wudao murmured softly, then gazed at the old men.

“After three years of guarding hell, if they survive, they’ll be stronger!”

“They are Star River Prefecture’s prodigies. They will surely return safely!” Star River Prefecture’s disciples watched with envy, murmuring among themselves.

……

In Huantian City, it was lively. A multitude of figures walked through the city, mostly young people.

At the center of Huantian City’s governor's mansion stood a massive platform covered in patterns. A young figure stood beneath it, his eyes filled with tension and excitement.

This platform was a teleportation array. It had never been activated before, only opening when someone journeyed to hell.

One thousand disciples from Zhong San Tian stood there. Each radiated a powerful aura, exchanging glances with mutual combativeness but no one attacked—this was Huantian City.

Luo Tian also spotted familiar faces in the crowd: Manhun and Jin Xiyang. Both were prodigies from their respective sects, naturally participating.

What surprised Luo Tian was encountering several other familiar faces—Yao Ming’s Eight Guards.

Back in the Death Desert, a sandstorm had scattered them all. Yao Ming’s Eight Guards had also disappeared. Luo Tian hadn’t expected to meet them here.

“Truly lively, ha!” Ye Liangchen laughed as he walked through the crowd, greeting other disciples.

These people naturally knew him. However, their eyes flickered with disdain but they smiled and responded politely to Ye Liangchen. What they thought remained known only to themselves.

“Everyone has arrived. Let’s begin! Wishing you good luck!” Jiang Yuzhe spoke softly, standing behind several strong figures. The governor of Huantian City, Jiang Wuxin, stood with a suppressed expression behind Jiang Yuzhe. It was clear that Jiang Yuzhe had made his life difficult these past days.

“Activate it!” As Jiang Yuzhe’s words ended, the massive teleportation array activated. One thousand people vanished from sight, beginning a three-year military service.

The long teleportation was longer than any Luo Tian had taken before. After nearly a quarter of an hour, the one thousand people finally landed safely, feeling their heads heavy.

But as soon as they landed, a sense of danger spread through their minds. They immediately stood alert and looked around.

Dark skies with no sun, moon, or stars. Endless clouds hovered above them, a chilling atmosphere spreading across the heavens and earth.

“Welcome to Butian City!” A cold, authoritative voice echoed in their ears. Everyone’s bodies trembled slightly.

A middle-aged man stood there, his face square, wearing black armor. His eyes were sharp and bright, his body straight as a spear.

Behind him stood more soldiers in black armor. Their aura was overwhelming, surrounding Luo Tian and others with a massive pressure.

“Welcome!” A unified voice echoed. Their eyes, like hawks and wolves, gazed at Luo Tian with iron will.

“Mother of heaven!” The overwhelming pressure caused some prodigies to tremble in their legs, others even collapsing on the ground.

“Tian Ge, Chen Ge… help me! My legs are weak!” Ye Liangchen addressed Luo Tian and Ye Chen, his legs trembling.

“Such a powerful pressure!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, helping Ye Liangchen up. Even he felt startled by the pressure.

“Welcome!” Seeing only a hundred people had collapsed, the soldiers roared again. Their pressure became even more overwhelming, darkening the sky and pressing upon everyone.

“Another few hundred collapsed. These people’s pressure is too overwhelming. Even if they are prodigies, they couldn’t withstand this iron will of battle.”

Moreover, these prodigies had never experienced the battlefield. They were like flowers in a greenhouse, only fighting among themselves.

“Good, this batch is better than usual!” The middle-aged man’s face showed satisfaction. He gazed at those still standing, then slowly raised his hand.

“Boom…” As the middle-aged man lifted his hand, the overwhelming pressure pressing on them vanished.

“I am Jiang Ming. Commander of the Black Armor Army in Butian City’s Eight Armies. From now on, for the next three years or longer, you will live here in Butian City!”

“I don’t care who your sects are. Once you’re in Butian City, you are soldiers—lowest rank soldiers. Here, put aside your sect’s ways. In my eyes, you are all trash. If anyone disobeys, step forward! Here, the most worthless thing is a life!” Jiang Ming spoke again, causing everyone to be stunned.

Chapter 2011: The Cruel Hell()

“Here, I can kill you without any reason. If I say you live, you live; if I say you die, you die. Don’t defy my will. Of course, right now, you are nothing!”

“Disobeying orders is death! Defying superiors is death! Even a hundred-man commander will be your superior. Here, all battles are measured by battle merits. A Celestial Immortal early stage ghost is one merit point, a middle-stage is ten points, an advanced-stage is a hundred points…”

“Merit points are the most direct way here. The more merits you have, the higher your rank—lieutenant, hundred-man commander… thousand-man commander… ten-thousand-man commander… even I, the army commander, can reach that level!” The middle-aged man spoke, explaining Butian City’s rules.

“I’m just telling you the basics. Now that I’ve personally led the Black Armor Army to welcome you, it’s your fortune. Later, you’ll be assigned to various barracks. There, they will explain the barracks’ rules!” Jiang Ming spoke again before flying into the air and vanishing from sight.

Everyone stood in stunned silence, unsure of what to do. They gazed at the black-armored soldiers surrounding them.

“Go on, you people are really good. In past batches, almost everyone collapsed from fear. I’ll lead you to your place!” A black-armored soldier stepped forward, addressing them. The other soldiers wore expressions of disdain and left in unison.

“That’s right! Don’t you see who I am? My father is the Star River Prefecture Lord Ye Wudao. My uncle is Ye Tian. My elder is Ye Sheng…” The pressure vanished, and Ye Liangchen immediately returned to his brash self. He habitually announced his background to the black-armored soldier.

“Even Star River Prefecture Lord Ye Wudao must obey the army commander!”

“I advise you to speak less here. The more you talk, the faster you die!” The black-armored soldier showed disdain.

“You are ten to a team. In one quarter of an hour, line up properly. If anyone isn’t lined up correctly, I’ll throw you outside the city to feed ghosts!” The black-armored soldier spoke again. His voice was cold, his gaze on them.

This black-armored soldier had a cultivation level of the threshold of an Immortal King. Yet his voice was unusually commanding, scolding Luo Tian and others as if they were commoners.

“Hmph! A soldier dares to scold us like this? Any one of us could subdue you!” Though they had been intimidated by the black-armored soldiers’ pressure, these prodigies were now defiant.

“Better to line up quickly! Didn’t you hear the army commander’s words? I am a hundred-man commander. I have the power to decide life and death for one hundred people!” The black-armored soldier sneered, crossing his arms and gazing at the person who had spoken.

“Line up!” Luo Tian slightly raised his brows, addressing Ye Liangchen and others. He stood there, with Ye Liangchen and Ye Chen standing at the front, while others followed behind.

Others also moved. Though they were prodigies and proud, they all understood the saying “when under a roof, one must bow.”

In one quarter of an hour, one hundred teams of ten people stood there. Their eyes carried a sense of委屈 (resentment).

“That’s more like it! Come on!” The black-armored soldier showed satisfaction. He then stepped forward, leading Luo Tian out of the teleportation array.

Tall city walls stretched endlessly. Every hundred feet, a soldier stood there, gazing beyond the wall. These soldiers wore plain clothes instead of black armor.

Black earth was covered with dark mist, and a roar echoed from the dark fog. A cold atmosphere spread across the heavens and earth.

On the black earth, faintly visible were piles of bones. This atmosphere made people shiver with cold.

Seeing the black-armored soldiers, those stationed on the city walls showed reverence.

“That is the entrance to hell—the Kan Gate of the Eight Gates. Our task is to prevent ghosts from crossing Butian City!” The black-armored soldier spoke.

“You, come out!” The black-armored soldier pointed at a young man in purple robes.

“Me?” The youth looked puzzled but stepped forward to the black-armored soldier’s side.

The young man had a cultivation level of Celestial Immortal advanced stage. As a prodigy, his strength was much stronger than ordinary Celestial Immortal advanced-stage.

“Correct. It’s you!” The black-armored soldier spoke coldly, then suddenly grabbed the young man's neck.

“You…” The youth’s face changed. He reached out to grab the black-armored soldier, but was immediately caught by the neck.

“Fast!” Everyone was slightly stunned. Though the black-armored soldier had a surprise element, this Celestial Immortal advanced-stage prodigy should have no trouble defending.

“Life Gate!” Luo Tian, Qiu Qianti, and Ye Chen all spoke at the same time. Their eyes flickered slightly.

The young man caught by the neck seemed paralyzed, his hand reaching out at the black-armored soldier trembling slightly.

“Steady. Accurate. Ruthless!” Luo Tian could only describe this black-armored soldier with three words. His attack was lightning-fast, seizing the young man’s life gate without giving him a chance to resist.

“Terrifying combat!” Others also marveled. Those who had previously looked down on the black-armored soldiers now wore expressions of seriousness.

“Earlier, you said anyone could subdue me? Disobedient?” The black-armored soldier’s demeanor changed. He gazed at the young man.

“Ugh… ugh…” The youth made a sound but couldn’t speak, as if his strength had been drained completely.

The black-armored soldier stepped toward the city wall’s edge and then threw the young man out beyond it.

“Ah…” The youth roared but couldn’t move, falling into the black earth below.

The city wall was a hundred feet high. Moments later, the youth landed on the ground, coughing up blood.

“Roar…” As soon as he landed, dark mist rose from the ground. Several black ghosts emerged and lunged at him.

In an instant, a heart-wrenching scream echoed from beneath the city wall. The ghosts devoured the young man, leaving a pile of bones in sight.

“See? These are flesh-eating ghosts. The lowest level of hell’s creatures. They’re everywhere outside Butian City. Once you leave Butian City, they’ll attack!” The black-armored soldier spoke to Luo Tian and others.

“You…” One of the young man’s companions watched their comrade turn into bones, his face changing.

“Disobedient?” The black-armored soldier showed indifference. He gazed at the remaining nine, his eyes revealing danger.

“Disobedient? Come on. According to military rank, I am a hundred-man commander. I don’t command others, but we are under Jiang Ming’s army!”

“A hundred-man commander. As the name suggests, it means one against a hundred! Each of us has a million battle merits!” The black-armored soldier showed pride.

“A million merits. That means you’ve killed a million Celestial Immortal early-stage ghosts!” People gasped.

“Roar…” As people were stunned, a thunderous roar echoed through the heavens and earth. The dark ghost mist thickened to the point of overwhelming, drifting toward Butian City.

“Another outbreak!” A multitude of soldiers on the city wall shouted. They simultaneously threw a talisman into the sky.

“Boom… boom…” Thunderous sounds echoed, one hundred lightning bolts rising from the sky.

“A million merits. No need to worry!” The black-armored soldier smiled, clearly this was a common occurrence.

“Boom… boom…” Heavy sounds echoed, striking the black earth. The dark ghost mist gradually approached Butian City. In the fog, ten massive figures of a hundred feet appeared in sight.

“Brothers, follow me to fight!” A series of roars echoed. A multitude of figures rushed out of the city gates, ten to a team, hundred to a squad, thousand to a division. They rushed toward the ghosts.

“Roar…” In an instant, countless ghosts—many even Luo Tian couldn’t recognize—began fighting with soldiers wearing various clothes. Several True Immortal masters also targeted the ten massive ghost figures.

“Ten True Immortal early-stage giant ghosts. It seems no one will be promoted to ten-thousand-man commander this time!” The black-armored soldier shook his head slightly.

“Go on. Don’t watch. Tomorrow at this time, you’ll be out there fighting. Ghost attacks happen three times a day. Whether you survive or not depends on your own!”

“However, these people are new here. You can choose to stay in Butian City for three months. But only three months! After that, you must participate in combat. That’s the rule!” The black-armored soldier spoke before walking forward.

“Three times a day. This is the least of it! And there’s more!” Everyone felt heavy-hearted, gazing at soldiers fighting with ghosts.

“Here, perhaps this is my treasure!” Luo Tian’s eyes were bright. He thought of the Ghost-Subduing Seal and the Three-Headed Black Dog—both ghosts’ weaknesses.

Time passed. The black-armored soldier led the group down from the city wall, onto the ground. Vast open land was filled with people. Each group lounged idly, chatting in small groups.

Battle raged outside the city walls, but inside Butian City, it was a stark contrast. Butian City was similar to a normal city but much larger than most, even surpassing some sects in size.

The people inside radiated powerful auras. Compared to Luo Tian and others, they had an added sense of experience.

Chapter 2012: Ghost-Repelling Pills()

“Hmph, new people have arrived!” The people in the city gazed at Luo Tian and others with mockery.

“Truly young. When we arrived, it was the same!” People murmured lowly, gazing at Luo Tian and others.

“These people have some ghost aura on them. Their bodies radiate a sinister energy!” Luo Tian’s gaze was slightly puzzled.

After mastering the Ghost-Subduing Seal, Luo Tian was highly sensitive to ghost aura. At first, he hadn’t noticed it, but after some time, he realized these soldiers were different. Even the black-armored soldier had a faint ghost aura within his body.

“Though this ghost aura seems harmless, it becomes a隐患 (hazard) over time if not removed!” Luo Tian thought to himself.

The black-armored soldier led Luo Tian and others to a large courtyard. Though it was called an “enclosure,” it was actually a vast area surrounded by fences, about tens of thousands of feet in size.

Inside the fence, it seemed divided into levels. Outside were some people, then small grass houses in the middle, and inside were courtyards, even more luxurious palaces further within.

“You people will stay here temporarily. I’ll imprint the military rules into jade slips later. These wristbands are for accumulating battle merits. Each ghost you kill will convert to merits, imprinted on these wristbands!” The black-armored soldier spoke before tossing a pile of jade slips and wristbands to the group.

“Ah? Where am I staying? Which house is mine?” As the black-armored soldier finished speaking, someone immediately asked.

“Stay? Ha! Seems these kids really don’t understand the rules!” The people around laughed at this.

“Kid, those rooms are for the thousand-man commanders and hundred-man commanders. If your merits are enough, you can challenge them. If you win the challenge, you’ll be able to live there. Of course, if you don’t succeed, then you’ll sleep on the ground like us!” A young man spoke.

“I’ve been sleeping on the ground for two years. I’ve challenged thirty times and never succeeded!” The young man’s face showed disdain.

“Sleeping on the ground. I’ve never slept there in my life!” Ye Liangchen immediately protested, shouting loudly. However, when the black-armored soldier’s cold gaze fell on him, Ye Liangchen closed his mouth.

“Hope you’re lucky! Tomorrow, you can go out to hunt ghosts. Of course, if you act alone, your safety isn’t guaranteed. I still recommend waiting for the ghost attacks on the city gates and joining the main force to block them!”

“Normally, the city is quite quiet. You can get anything you want, but only if you have merits. In Butian City, merits are the only currency!” The black-armored soldier spoke before walking into the courtyard’s depths.

“We’re not guarding hell, we’re just living in it!” People muttered after the black-armored soldier disappeared.

Luo Tian grabbed a jade slip and a wristband, which landed in his hand. A series of information also appeared in his mind, including detailed military rules.

“Rest!” Luo Tian sighed longingly. He gazed at the people around him, all with discontented faces. He found a place to sit down.

“Tian Ge, we can’t stay here forever, can we?” Seeing Luo Tian’s easygoing attitude, Ye Liangchen approached him.

“Indeed!” Qiu Qianti showed a flicker of admiration in his eyes, watching Luo Tian sit cross-legged.

“What else can we do? Without merits, we can’t challenge those inside. The immediate priority is to accumulate merits!” Luo Tian spoke, his voice filled with helplessness.

“Alright, come here. Let’s discuss how we’ll live from now on. I think it’s better to cooperate with each other than with others!” Ye Chen spoke coldly, gazing at Ye Fu and Qiu Qianti.

“Good!” Qiu Qianti spoke first, leading Ye Die to sit beside Luo Tian and Ye Chen.

“What about you?” Ye Chen gazed at the others, a slight smile on his face.

“We’ll follow Ye Chen’s lead!” The others immediately spoke. In their minds, Ye Chen and Luo Tian were the strongest among them. They had seen hell’s cruelty and realized that sticking together was safer than going alone.

Ye Fu slightly frowned but also walked to Luo Tian and Ye Chen’s side.

“Since no one has any objections, we’ve formed a small team. I’ll say this first—regardless of our past conflicts, for the next three years, we must unite!” Ye Chen spoke loudly, clearly taking charge.

“Everything is under Ye Chen’s leadership!” The disciples immediately shouted. Compared to Luo Tian, Ye Chen was deeply rooted in their minds.
