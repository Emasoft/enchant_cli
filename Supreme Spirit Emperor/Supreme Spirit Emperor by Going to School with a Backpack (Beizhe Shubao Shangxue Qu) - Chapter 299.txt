“Hmph, you really can't take a joke. It's fine to tell you—the method was taught by that kid just now. Remember to owe someone a favor!” Long Jing addressed the snow-white fierce beast, revealing the method of transformation.

At that moment, Luo Tian returned to his courtyard on the Third Island, waiting for Shen Gong Fei Chi's arrival.

Luo Tian and Shen Gong Fu had just returned to the Third Island when they parted ways. Shen Gong Fu informed Luo Tian that he would announce his appointment as Deputy Island Master the next day, and would arrange a new dwelling for him. For now, he was to endure some hardship. Luo Tian naturally didn't mind.

But after half an hour of waiting, Shen Gong Fei Chi's rotund figure still hadn't appeared. Luo Tian grew impatient.

“Luo… Elder Brother!” As Luo Tian's impatience deepened, a Superhuman-grade disciple rushed toward him from afar, appearing at his side with an anxious expression.

“Hm?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, recognizing the man. This was one of those who had intercepted him when he first arrived on the island, alongside Shen Gong Fei Chi.

“What's wrong?” Luo Tian asked the disciple, extending a hand to stabilize the chaotic Superhuman energy within him.

“Shen Gong Fei Chi was captured by the Second Instructor! He specifically ordered you to come and retrieve him. I went to the Island Master's quarters, but he wasn't there, so I came looking for you!” The disciple sighed deeply.

“Hmph, it seems we need to send a warning,” Luo Tian's eyes flashed with cold determination. He quickly deduced who was behind this.

Only Ge Yuanzheng had offended him since arriving on the Third Island, so Luo Tian didn't need to guess—this was surely Ge Yuanzheng's doing.

His vast spiritual awareness swept across the Third Island, unimpeded by any restrictions. In an instant, he located Shen Gong Fei Chi's position.

“Die!” Luo Tian snarled, vanishing in an instant before the disciple's eyes.

“This…!” The disciple was stunned by Luo Tian's speed, then his expression turned anxious.

“I'll go check with the Island Master again,” the disciple said, his face etched with worry. He sensed Luo Tian's formidable nature but also knew the Second Instructor was no pushover—after years of authority, the disciple's mind had been imprinted with that fear.

“Hum…” Luo Tian appeared in an instant within a courtyard, seeing Shen Gong Fei Chi bound and suspended.

At this moment, Shen Gong Fei Chi was beyond description—his plump body was riddled with wounds, flesh torn open from whippings.

Chapter 1240: Together to Clean Up ()

Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness. He extended a hand, grasping Shen Gong Fei Chi who was bound. Five golden lights shot from his palm, severing the sacred energy chains binding Shen Gong Fei Chi. The latter's massive body plummeted to the ground.

A golden hand凝聚, lifting Shen Gong Fei Chi into Luo Tian's presence.

“Is it you?” As Shen Gong Fei Chi's body appeared beside Luo Tian, a weathered voice echoed in his ear. A white whisk swept toward him.

“Indeed!” Luo Tian snorted, pressing a hand against Shen Gong Fei Chi's back to heal his wounds while the other hand snatched at the whisk.

“Hmph, you really are seeking death. This whisk is a pseudo-era treasure—dare to face it with your bare hands!” The voice of a senior echoed, as a green-clad elder materialized before Luo Tian's gaze. He stood nearby, his eyes filled with mockery.

“Pseudo-era treasure? You dare to suppress me?” Luo Tian spoke without fear, forming his palm into a fist and striking the whisk.

“Boom…” A shockwave erupted. The pseudo-era treasure's whisk flipped violently, crashing toward the elder.

“An ordinary Sage Peak—dare to wield a pseudo-era treasure before me? You're seeking death!” Luo Tian spoke, ignoring the elder. Sacred energy surged into Shen Gong Fei Chi's body, instantly healing most of his wounds.

“Crack…” As Luo Tian healed Shen Gong Fei Chi, the whisk struck the elder's chest, shattering bones.

“Spit…!” The elder coughed up old blood, his eyes wide with shock as he was hurled backward into a hall.

“Crash…” The hall collapsed, revealing countless astonished figures staring at Luo Tian in disbelief.

“Attack together! I'll take responsibility!” The elder, coughing blood, ordered the crowd.

“Yes!” The people shivered at Luo Tian's presence. They hadn't expected such a young man to be so强势, his power so formidable that he had already felled the Second Instructor.

The Second Instructor was a Sage Peak—yet he'd been felled by this youth in one strike. Though they were confused, they had no choice but to attack. Several Sage Peak End and Sage Peak Middle disciples rushed forward with martial techniques toward Luo Tian.

“Luo Elder Brother!” Shen Gong Fei Chi stirred, feeling warmth within his body. Seeing Luo Tian beside him, he gazed with gratitude.

“Rest well,” Luo Tian said, sensing Shen Gong Fei Chi's injuries weren't severe—though he looked battered, there was no life-threatening danger. After all, Shen Gong Fei Chi had some relation to Shen Gong Fu; they wouldn't kill him outright. But this still enraged Luo Tian.

Luo Tian placed Shen Gong Fei Chi aside, then formed a barrier to protect him before turning his gaze toward the various martial techniques attacking him. His lips curled slightly.

“Go!” Luo Tian roared, a wave of invisible energy bursting from his mouth, thunderous in the crowd's ears.

“Boom…” The powerful martial techniques shattered into multicolored sacred energy, dispersing before Luo Tian.

At the same time, those who had attacked him spat blood and fell like broken kites to the ground.

“Old fool, you really have nerve—using your seniority to oppress a junior!” Luo Tian stepped onto the ground, walking toward the elder who had just risen but was knocked down again.

“What are you doing? I am the Second Instructor of this island, Hu Jianhua. My nephew is Hu Tianzong; if you harm me, he won't forgive you!” The elder, finally realizing his mistake, declared his identity.

“Hmph, your nephew is Hu Tianzong—the second-ranked genius of the Seven Star Island? Half-Era cultivation?” Luo Tian smiled, approaching Hu Jianhua.

“Yes! My elder brother is the Grand Instructor, Hu Jian’an! If you harm me, you won’t be able to stay on this Third Island!” Hu Jianhua shouted.

“You really have guts, relying on your nephew to back you up. You’ve lived long enough to be so shameless!” Luo Tian extended a foot, stomping Hu Jianhua's face into the earth. Dust exploded, and the elder's head was deeply embedded in the soil. A shockwave rippled outward, toppling buildings and drawing a crowd.

“What's going on? Who is this youth?” Figures appeared in Luo Tian’s vision, their eyes scanning him without recognition.

Luo Tian's foot had been carefully controlled—no life was taken, but Hu Jianhua’s skull was fractured.

“Cough…!” Hu Jianhua staggered up, his face twisted with hatred as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“Hush…” A murmur spread through the crowd, their eyes filled with shock as they watched Hu Jianhua nearly crushed by Luo Tian.

“Boom…” Before Hu Jianhua could react, Luo Tian struck him again with a palm, sending him flying. His expression was cold.

“Don’t mention your position—whether it’s your useless nephew or your elder brother himself, if the three of you come together, I’ll still beat you, old turtle!” Luo Tian's form reappeared before Hu Jianhua, his foot repeatedly stomping onto the elder’s body.

“This man… who dares to treat the Second Instructor like this!” The crowd was stunned, their eyes filled with disbelief. For years, no one had dared to treat the Second Instructor this way.

“Stop!” As the crowd was shocked, another weathered voice echoed. A senior elder descended from the sky, striking Luo Tian with a palm.

“Grand Instructor!” The crowd bowed respectfully, their eyes filled with reverence.

“Another one? Perfect—let’s deal with them all!” Luo Tian stomped Hu Jianhua underfoot, ignoring the Grand Instructor’s attack. The powerful palm struck Luo Tian's body without effect, while golden hands凝聚, sweeping toward Hu Jian’an.

“You damned fool—get down!” Luo Tian snorted, his body glowing with golden light as if clad in gold. Hu Jian’an’s palm struck him without harm, and his foot still pressed onto Hu Jianhua.

“Boom…” Invisible waves rose from Luo Tian, pushing the surrounding crowd back.

At the same time, the golden hand凝聚 by Luo Tian struck Hu Jian’an, imprinting a seal on the ground. Hu Jian’an met the same fate as Hu Jianhua, spitting blood and collapsing to the ground in disbelief.

Luo Tian finally lifted his foot from Hu Jianhua’s face, placing it instead on Hu Jian’an’s. Cracks splintered across the elder’s head.

“Grand Instructor… also stepped on?” The crowd was speechless, staring at Luo Tian who stood with overwhelming authority. They hadn’t expected anyone to dare step on both the Grand and Second Instructors in this Third Island.

“Ah…” Shen Gong Fei Chi’s heart trembled, watching Luo Tian with awe. He had never imagined that this man would dare to treat the two instructors so harshly.

“This is a big mess!” Shen Gong Fei Chi thought, trembling as he rose slowly. He needed to find Shen Gong Fu quickly to resolve this matter.

“All disciples of the Third Island, listen! I issue the Grand Instructor’s command—kill this enemy who invaded our island!” Hu Jian’an, still under Luo Tian’s foot, barked orders to the crowd. As he spoke, two mouthfuls of dirt entered his mouth.

“Yes!” The Grand Instructor’s words fell, and the crowd’s gaze toward Luo Tian shifted. They now saw him as an enemy, instantly surrounding him with nearly a thousand disciples, their eyes filled with hostility.

“Release the Grand Instructor!” The crowd shouted, brandishing weapons.

Luo Tian furrowed his brow. These people were nothing to him, even if there were more. But considering he needed to live here in the Third Island, he had no intention of attacking them.

“Attack! The one who attacks will be rewarded with a Saint-Grade初级 pill!” Seeing the crowd merely surrounding him without attacking, Hu Jian’an could no longer endure. Being stepped on by Luo Tian was an unbearable torment.

“Kill!” Upon hearing Hu Jian’an’s words, the crowd roared in unison.

“Hum…” However, Luo Tian extended a hand, and a green token flew from his palm. It glowed with emerald light, expanding into a stone tablet under his control.

“What is this?” The crowd looked at the token hovering above Luo Tian’s head, confusion etched on their faces. When they saw the three characters engraved in silver script on it, they halted and bowed deeply.

“This is the token of the Deputy Island Master—how could it be in his hands!” Their shock was indescribable, staring at the token. They dared not attack Luo Tian anymore.

Chapter 1241: Announcement ()

The green token hovered like a stone tablet above Luo Tian, radiating an imposing aura. The nearly thousand disciples surrounding him now wore expressions of respect, gazing at the token and knowing what it represented.

“You are the Grand Instructor; I am the Deputy Island Master!” Luo Tian stomped Hu Jian’an’s face again, his eyes filled with disdain.

“Is it true?” The crowd was bewildered, staring at Luo Tian in disbelief. They hadn’t expected this young man to be their Third Island’s Deputy Island Master.

“Deputy… Deputy Island Master!” Shen Gong Fei Chi, who had just risen, fell back to the ground in shock. He hadn’t expected his Elder Brother Luo Tian to become a Deputy Island Master overnight.

“Impossible! How could you be the Deputy Island Master? I am the Grand Instructor—I didn’t know!” Hu Jian’an was stunned, his eyes filled with disbelief.

“You don’t know a lot of things!” Luo Tian continued stomping, his footprints covering both Hu Jianhua and Hu Jian’an. The two elders howled in pain, their suffering unbearable as more onlookers gathered, making them feel utterly humiliated.

“Boom…” Finally, Luo Tian seemed to tire, kicking both men like dogs into the air. They landed on the ground, their bodies marked with Luo Tian’s footprints.

“Dare to leave your name? This isn’t over!” Hu Jian’an, after catching his breath for half a day, glared at Luo Tian with hatred.

“Luo Tian!” Luo Tian spoke boldly, his gaze unyielding as he stared at the two elders.

“Ah… this is a big mess!” Shen Gong Fei Chi sighed deeply, knowing that Hu Tianzong was the grandson of these two men. The thought of the terrifying Hu Tianzong made his heart tremble.

“My grandson is Hu Tianzong, currently in seclusion. When he emerges, he will surely come for you! Wait and see—today’s humiliation I’ll return tenfold!” Hu Jianhua spat blood, his face twisted with hatred. Whether it was anger or the pain from Luo Tian’s attack, it was unclear.

“The Deputy Island Master position isn’t easy to hold!” Hu Jian’an spoke bitterly, his gaze filled with hatred toward Luo Tian.

This position had been meticulously planned for Hu Tianzong by him and his brother. After all, among the Third Island’s disciples, only Hu Tianzong matched Shen Gong Fu in strength.

As Grand Instructor, his power wasn’t in combat but in alchemy. Eighty percent of the island’s alchemists obeyed him—a terrifying strength. It was clear that Hu Tianzong would soon become Deputy Island Master.

But Hu Jian’an and his brother never expected a man like Luo Tian to appear out of nowhere, producing the Deputy Island Master’s token.

“Whether it’s easy or not is up to you! Now I am the Deputy Island Master, and my position is higher than yours. What do you plan to do?” Luo Tian crossed his arms, a playful expression on his face as he gazed at the two elders.

“Go!” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed, his intent clear—should they speak again, he wouldn’t hesitate to teach them another lesson.

Luo Tian now understood why Shen Gong Fu had made him Deputy Island Master. It was because of his Half-Era cultivation, aiming to balance the three generations of the Hu family.

Luo Tian knew he had been slightly used by Shen Gong Fu, but there was no choice. To survive in the Third Island, he needed a position—Deputy Island Master was undoubtedly the most advantageous.

“What’s going on? Why are you all gathered here?” As the crowd marveled at Luo Tian, a stern voice echoed. Shen Gong Fu’s rotund figure appeared before them.

“Respect the Island Master!” The crowd bowed immediately, their eyes flicking to the battered Hu Jian’an and his brother, a slight smirk on their faces.

“Too harsh! This kid is too brutal!” Shen Gong Fu sighed inwardly, watching the two men whose brains seemed nearly crushed by Luo Tian.

“Island Master, please protect us! This kid doesn’t know why he attacked us with his Half-Era cultivation. If you hadn’t arrived in time, we might have been killed!” Seeing Shen Gong Fu arrive, Hu Jian’an instantly shifted to the victim’s role. Luo Tian secretly marveled at this old man's acting skills.

“Hmph, you’ve miscalculated!” Luo Tian thought coldly. He didn’t believe Shen Gong Fu was unaware of what had happened.

If he knew, why wait until after the incident to arrive? Luo Tian could easily guess Shen Gong Fu’s intention—to let him establish authority.

“Island Master, why does this kid have the Deputy Island Master’s token?” Before Shen Gong Fu could answer, Hu Jian’an spoke again, his gaze on Shen Gong Fu with a tone of complaint.

“It must be stolen!” Hu Jian’an shouted, ordering the crowd: “Capture this kid!”

“Smack…” Luo Tian looked at Hu Jian’an’s face, unable to resist slapping him again—nearly knocking the old man out.

“Old fool, the Island Master is here. Do you have the right to speak?” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed, his gaze on Shen Gong Fu.

One elder and one youth locked eyes. After a moment, Shen Gong Fu nodded slightly: “Alright, everyone is family—don’t make it too tense!”

“I had planned to announce tomorrow. Since this kid revealed it today, let’s just announce it now! From today onward, Luo Tian is the Deputy Island Master of my Third Island. When I’m not here, he will fully represent me!” Shen Gong Fu spoke loudly, a smile on his face as he gazed at the crowd.

“Hush…” The murmurs returned, then silence fell. Their eyes turned to Luo Tian—unfamiliar with him, they didn’t believe he could胜任 this position. Everything was fleeting; if Hu Tianzong emerged, Luo Tian’s reputation would plummet instantly, and Hu Tianzong would easily overturn the situation. After all, Hu Tianzong’s strength was deeply ingrained in their minds.

Moreover, most of those present were alchemists; their pride wasn’t earned by high cultivation.

Even if Luo Tian was the Deputy Island Master, the Grand Instructor Hu Jian’an remained their revered figure. His alchemical skills had earned them all respect.

“Respect the Deputy Island Master!” Shen Gong Fei Chi, clearly skilled in socializing, noticed the crowd’s silence and immediately led the bow, his eyes filled with awe. To him, Luo Tian was now a godlike figure.

Shen Gong Fei Chi never expected Luo Tian to become the Third Island’s second-in-command overnight, ranking just below Shen Gong Fu.

“Respect the Deputy Island Master!” With one person leading, others reluctantly bowed to Luo Tian despite their reservations. After all, he was officially the Deputy Island Master now.

“Alright, no important ceremony—just inform each other!” Shen Gong Fu smiled, dismissing the crowd.

“The biggest test is still with Hu Tianzong. Your troubles will continue; be careful!” Shen Gong Fu patted Luo Tian’s shoulder, smiling as he left.

“Old fox!” Luo Tian muttered under his breath but smiled: “Respect the Island Master!”

“Go, your injuries should be healed by now!” Luo Tian smiled, gently patting Shen Gong Fei Chi’s shoulder. He ignored the crowd’s gazes, especially the bloodshot faces of Hu Jian’an and his brother.

Under the crowd’s complex gazes, Luo Tian and Shen Gong Fei Chi disappeared from view, heading toward the island’s drug market.

“Elder Brother!” Hu Jianhua spoke, gazing at Hu Jian’an. He was completely stunned by Luo Tian’s actions, his mind devoid of any strategy.

“Follow this kid; I want to see what chaos he can stir up! This Deputy Island Master position is always Hu Tianzong’s. A kid like this dares to steal it? Dream on!” Hu Jianhua ordered the crowd, his voice icy.

“Yes!” As Hu Jianhua’s words fell, two disciples stepped out of the crowd to track Luo Tian and Shen Gong Fei Chi.

Soon, the Third Island erupted in chaos. Luo Tian’s name spread throughout the island and even to the Seven Star Island.

“A Half-Era cultivation, Deputy Island Master of the Third Island—has the Seven Star Island gained another Half-Era genius?”

“You don’t know? This is a ruthless character. His origins are unknown, but on his first day, he nearly crushed the Third Island’s Instructors Hu Jian’an and Hu Jianhua!”

“Ha! This is going to be interesting. If Hu Tianzong emerges, will this Luo Tian still be so bold?” The crowd murmured, waiting for the Seven Star Island’s legendary genius Hu Tianzong to emerge.

“Deputy Island Master, I should tell you that this Third Island is the one with the most herbs in the entire Seven Star Island. This is the trading market for the whole Seven Star Island!” Shen Gong Fei Chi, his face beaming, looked at the bustling market and spoke to Luo Tian.

Chapter 1242: Thunder-Shaking Pills ()

The Seven Star Trading Market, the largest trading hub in the Seven Star Island. Here, treasures, herbs, and everything else were available.

Luo Tian and Shen Gong Fei Chi walked through the bustling market, their eyes scanning the stalls.

“This trading market is quite good. However, the herbs here are ordinary,” Luo Tian shook his head. The herbs in this market were all common, and he hadn’t found anything worth his attention. He bought some healing herbs for Shen Gong Fei Chi and a few Saint-Grade pills, as he had promised.

The only thing that made Luo Tian feel relieved was the herbs being much cheaper here than in the Nine Domains—ten times cheaper. This made him feel that Long Jing’s one hundred million spiritual stones were a huge sum.

“Deputy Island Master, this trading market is full of people from various places—not just our Third Island but others too. We should stay low,” Shen Gong Fei Chi said, watching the crowd. He feared this fearless Luo Tian would provoke someone.

“Don’t worry; I know my limits. If they don’t bother me, I won’t provoke them,” Luo Tian patted Shen Gong Fei Chi’s shoulder. His gaze was constantly scanning for valuable items, even using his Purple Extreme Demon Eyes.

“By the way, from now on, don’t call me Deputy Island Master. If close friends do it, I’m still not used to it,” Luo Tian said again to Shen Gong Fei Chi.

“Yes, Deputy Island Master!” Shen Gong Fei Chi replied immediately, his voice respectful. He felt honored to have a connection with the Deputy Island Master.

“Hm?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, stopping at a stall. His purple eyes flashed with interest as he gazed at an unremarkable stone on the stall.

“Old man, how much for this broken rock?” Luo Tian picked up the stone and weighed it in his hand.

“This stone isn’t for sale; you need to exchange it with pills or herbs,” the old stall owner, a Superhuman-grade cultivator, said.

“What kind of pills?” Luo Tian raised an eyebrow. He didn’t have any pills to craft at the moment; if it wasn’t too difficult, he might finish them soon.

“Life-Sustaining Pills!” The stall owner announced his price directly, making Luo Tian’s heart sink slightly.

Luo Tian knew of Life-Sustaining Pills—they could extend one’s life by a hundred years, a Saint-Grade初级 pill. Though not high-level, it was rare.

“What is Life-Sustaining Pill? I’ve never heard of it,” Shen Gong Fei Chi, born on the Third Island, had some knowledge of pills but hadn’t heard of this one.

“Old man, I have a single Root of Rebirth; it can extend life by eighty years. Let’s exchange this for the stone, okay?” A cold voice echoed from behind Luo Tian. A young man stepped beside him, extending a hand to offer the old stall owner a gray herb.

The young man carried a long sword on his back, clearly no ordinary weapon. His entire presence was imposing, but he radiated a cold aura despite his efforts to suppress it.

“Yang Jinghua!” Shen Gong Fei Chi’s fat face twitched involuntarily, and he hid behind Luo Tian.

“Who is he?” Luo Tian sensed Yang Jinghua’s aura—Sage Peak End, but his energy was denser than usual. Clearly a genius.

“In the Seven Star Island, there are seven geniuses. The most famous are Guan Xingjian and Hu Tianzong. Yang Jinghua ranks second, but in the蛮族 (Barbarian Clan), his name is legendary—more feared than Guan Xingjian and Hu Tianzong!”

“Around the Seven Star Island’s seas, there is a special place called Sea’s Edge. It's a battlefield between humans and the Barbarian Clan, opening every ten years. During this time, both sides send armies to fight the Barbarians!”

“Over the past thirty years, every battle, Yang Jinghua has led many humans to fight bloodily. His name was forged on the battlefield of Sea’s Edge, built with Barbarian blood!” Shen Gong Fei Chi said respectfully, gazing at Yang Jinghua.

Luo Tian envisioned Yang Jinghua slashing the sky with his sword, fighting the Barbarian masters. His eyes showed admiration, recalling the battle between the Nine Domains and the Mortal Domain.

“Stay away!” Yang Jinghua’s face didn’t have these words, but his aura conveyed it. Everyone around him looked at him with reverence.

“Friend, I saw this stone first. I hope you won’t compete!” Luo Tian bowed slightly, gazing at Yang Jinghua. Though he admired the man, he wouldn’t give up this stone. After all, it was crucial to him.

“You saw it first—then produce the Life-Sustaining Pills, and I’ll let you have it!” Yang Jinghua looked at Luo Tian, his brow furrowed. Though he was impressed, he remained强势.

“Old man, let me have an hour. I’ll bring the Life-Sustaining Pills in one hour!” Luo Tian bowed to the stall owner.

“Fine, I’m near my end; I can’t gamble!” The old man said and threw the stone to Yang Jinghua, taking the Root of Rebirth from his hand. His face was satisfied.

Luo Tian watched the stone go to Yang Jinghua, his eyes flashing with a glint. He turned to Yang Jinghua: “Brother, would you be willing to part with this stone?”

“No, I need it!” Yang Jinghua said and turned to leave the trading market without looking back at Luo Tian.

“No, I must get it!” Luo Tian resolved, for the stone was precious. Through his Purple Extreme Demon Eyes, he saw it contained a few drops of milky liquid inside.

“Stalactite of Stone!” Luo Tian confirmed it was Stalactite of Stone, a material for Thunder-Shaking Pills. The effect of these pills was to shield the one facing heavenly punishment from a single divine judgment. How could Luo Tian not be excited? He was now Half-Era and needed to withstand the terrifying Era Judgment.

He had previously set up a divine punishment array to kill people, and Ming Yongzhi had used the divine punishment array to summon an Era-level heavenly judgment. Luo Tian had witnessed its devastating power and never forgot it.

Luo Tian knew his heavenly judgment was different from others—perhaps even more terrifying than Ming Yongzhi’s. There was a risk of falling. How could he not prepare?

“Brother, do you feel headaches every midnight and want to go mad?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed urgency as he transmitted his thoughts to Yang Jinghua, who was leaving.

“Hm?” Yang Jinghua stopped, his breath heavy. He turned to Luo Tian and asked softly: “How did you know?”

“Just answer—yes or no!” Luo Tian smiled, walking beside Yang Jinghua.

“Yes! Do you have a solution?” Yang Jinghua nodded and asked again, his eyes turning blood-red, glowing with an intimidating light.

“Yes!” Luo Tian nodded and crossed his arms. He ignored Yang Jinghua’s intimidating gaze.

“Three days later, I’ll find you!” Yang Jinghua waved his hand, throwing the stone into Luo Tian’s hands. He turned and left the trading market without looking back.

“Don’t play tricks; even if you’re Half-Era and Deputy Island Master, I won’t let your anger subside!” Yang Jinghua’s voice echoed in the market, startling the crowd.

“Who is this man?” The crowd turned their eyes to Luo Tian, confusion on their faces.

“Shen Gong Fei Chi, he’s from the Third Island. His cultivation is Half-Era. He’s this island’s new Deputy Island Master! Unexpectedly young!” Someone recognized Luo Tian, their eyes filled with curiosity.

“Is he trying to build a relationship with Yang Jinghua? If he has Yang Jinghua’s protection, Hu Tianzong won’t dare to touch him!” The crowd murmured.

Luo Tian was delighted, placing the stone in his storage bag without acknowledging the crowd’s strange glances.

“Let’s go, look for more!” Luo Tian said to Shen Gong Fei Chi, who stood straight. He felt this trading market was worth the visit.

They continued deeper into the market, where the herbs and treasures became better with each step, their prices rising.

“Tongling Grass? How much?” Luo Tian stopped at a stall, his face showing joy as he asked the vendor.

“Fifty million spiritual stones!” The vendor immediately quoted the price, making Luo Tian sigh inwardly. It was too cheap—if he still had his spiritual stones, he would have made a fortune.

“I’ll take it!” As Luo Tian was about to pay, a young man threw a storage bag and took the Tongling Grass.

“Hm?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow again, annoyed. Two times in a row, someone had stolen his items, making him angry.

“I paid first; it’s mine! Sorry!” A middle-aged man looked at Luo Tian, his eyes filled with mockery.

“Fine, don’t be too arrogant. It’s just a Tongling Grass; I’ll let it go,” Luo Tian sighed, continuing forward with Shen Gong Fei Chi.

“Eight-Transcendence Snow Lotus?” Luo Tian saw the herb he needed and asked the vendor again. But before the vendor could quote a price, another middle-aged man threw spiritual stones and bought it.

“Hmph! It seems someone is coming to find trouble for me. They really don’t learn from their mistakes!” Luo Tian’s face showed a cold smile, turning to look at the middle-aged man who had stolen his herb.

Chapter 1243: The Blind Old Man ()

“Smack…” Luo Tian turned, slapping the middle-aged man’s face with a smile.

“Boom…” The man fell to the ground, spitting out teeth, his eyes filled with disbelief.

“It seems I bought it first!” Luo Tian snorted, grabbing the storage bag the man had just handed over and tossing it to the vendor. “Sell it to me!”

“You dare!” The middle-aged man stood up, glaring at the vendor with a threatening look.

“This!” The vendor hesitated, looking at the middle-aged man. He had been here for years and recognized the man who had been knocked down by Luo Tian.
