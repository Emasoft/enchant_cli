Luo Tian had practiced these two steps hundreds of times over the past few days, naturally becoming thoroughly familiar. His vast spiritual awareness enveloped the medicinal liquid and condensed it into an elixir in an instant. Yet Luo Tian did not rush, a light smile playing on his lips as he controlled the elixir with his spiritual awareness, pressing it repeatedly before finally nodding in satisfaction and slapping the lid of the Zhen Hun Cauldron.

“Peng…” The thunderous sound resounded again, the black elixir flying into the sky as usual. A thick aura emanated from the elixir, hungrily absorbing the dense spiritual energy hovering above Ice Extreme Island.

At the very moment the elixir soared into the sky, Xu Lizi yi, who had been meditating with his eyes closed, suddenly opened them and gazed at the elixir in the sky.

“This time, it must succeed!” Luo Tian roared lowly, spitting blood that merged with the elixir.

“Gonglong…” Golden lightning dragons, as if impatient, surged forward and touched the elixir.

“Nine Heavens Xuanming! Reversing Heaven and Earth!” Luo Tian whispered, watching the two forces collide.

The black elixir flared with a brilliant darkness, its overwhelming aura erupting instantly, as if mocking the lightning tribulation. It spun rapidly.

An eerie spectacle unfolded: upon contact with the Nine Heavens Xuanming Elixir, the golden lightning tribulation twisted abruptly, bending back into the sky.

“Success!” Xu Lizi yi’s face lit up with joy, watching as the lightning tribulation dissipated slowly.

Chapter 543: Luo Zhan’s Seclusion

After the sky’s tribulation clouds dispersed, only the Nine Heavens Xuanming Elixir remained in the sky, radiating a steady black glow as if declaring its sovereignty.

Luo Tian let out a long laugh, his feet swirling with wind as he leapt into the sky and seized the black elixir, sealing it in a jade vial.

“Congratulations! You’ve ascended to the seventh rank of alchemy masters. From now on, you can go anywhere on Tianyuan Continent. Remember to look after your brothers!” Xu Lizi yi smiled, approaching Luo Tian who had landed.

“Luo Tian, you succeeded?” A voice echoed through the air as several figures flew toward them, their faces filled with surprise.

These were young men with youthful faces—Luo Qingqing had gathered them over the past days. They all hoped their lineage would rise again.

“Ha ha… No wonder you’re the son of my elder brother!” After Luo Qingqing spoke, Luo Zhan appeared before them, his gaze filled with emotion.

“Respect the clan leader!” Luo Tian and others bowed respectfully to Luo Zhan.

Luo Zhan gazed at Luo Tian, his expression touched. With Luo Tian now an alchemy master of the seventh rank, their lineage truly had a chance to rise. The power and energy of a seventh-rank alchemist surpassed that of a Soul Severance Realm powerhouse.

“Second Grandfather! Take this elixir,” Luo Tian said, handing the Nine Heavens Xuanming Elixir to Luo Zhan. “With this elixir, you should be able to enter the Soul Severance Realm. Without entering it, our lineage will never truly intimidate the other branches.”

Seeing Luo Tian’s gesture, those who had arrived gradually wore expressions of shock, their gazes toward Luo Tian shifting.

Especially the young men—their eyes gleamed with excitement. With a seventh-rank alchemist like Luo Tian, if he agreed to craft elixirs for them, their progression would match others.

In the main lineage, Luo Tai’s brows furrowed slightly. He could sense Luo Tian had truly succeeded, his mind growing solemn. He muttered lowly: “No wonder he’s the grandson of Luo Xiong; he truly isn’t someone to be trifled with!”

“Alchemy is but a minor art. Strength is the true king!” Luo Han stood behind Luo Tai, his face sneering.

“Strength? What about Luo Xing’an? That kid hasn’t returned yet. How strong is he?” Luo Tai, seeing Luo Han’s sneer, sighed softly.

Hearing Luo Tai’s words, Luo Han’s expression turned solemn. His battle spirit surged instantly, his gaze deep as he murmured: “I’ll go fetch him. It’s no good being caught like this!”

“Go, but be careful. Don’t let yourself get trapped again; that would be a major embarrassment!” Luo Tai said.

“Hmph! Who do you think he is? He hasn’t got the claws to hold me!” Luo Han said, his face showing arrogance as he strode toward the palace’s entrance.

Seeing Luo Han’s distant figure, Luo Tai sighed softly, his face filled with worry.

At that moment, the courtyard of Luo Tian was filled with joy. After seeing off everyone else, only Luo Tai and Luo Qingqing remained.

Luo Tai held the jade vial containing the Nine Heavens Xuanming Elixir and spoke softly: “I’ll go into seclusion now. With the dragon meat and this elixir, I have an 80% chance of entering the Soul Severance Realm. If all goes well, I’ll emerge in seven days. For these few days, the clan’s affairs will be under your care, you two!”

“Grandfather, rest assured. I’m sure the old men in the clan will still respect me Luo Qingqing. With your brother’s help, it’ll be even more secure!” Luo Qingqing said softly, his face showing a hint of pride.

After exchanging words, Luo Zhan set off toward the depths of Ice Extreme Island with excitement. After all, ascending to the Soul Severance Realm was too grand a display to remain in the clan.

After chatting with Luo Qingqing for a while, she also departed, leaving only Luo Tian, Xu Lizi yi, and Chen Zhanbiao.

After dismissing the two, Luo Tian resumed his elixir crafting. He intended to elevate the clan’s overall strength, making their preparations for the clan competition more secure.

As for entering the depths of Ice Extreme Island, Luo Tian had already thoroughly inquired with Luo Qingqing and Luo Zhan. He could only sigh bitterly; to enter the island’s depths, one had to obtain the main lineage position.

Because the deepest part of Ice Extreme Island was sealed by a formation, completely preventing even Soul Severance Realm masters from entering. The formation’s flags were always controlled by the main lineage.

When they spoke of these matters, Luo Tian could only sigh bitterly. He had made up his mind to enter the island’s depths at all costs, seeking the Qianshan Xuanbing Su (Thousand Mountains Ice髓) to heal Lu Kunpeng.

The thunderous sounds echoed again; five days passed in the blink of an eye. Luo Tian continuously crafted elixirs in his courtyard, and each time he completed one, it was taken away by Luo Zhen and Luo Wu to distribute among the clan.

That day, after finishing his elixir crafting, Luo Tian wore a faint look of fatigue, wiping sweat from his brow and intending to rest.

But in the next moment, the courtyard’s door was suddenly smashed open by a group of young men with arrogant faces. The leader was Luo Han.

Luo Tian stepped out of the courtyard, his face slightly startled as he gazed at the group before him. His brows furrowed slightly.

At the same time, Xu Lizi yi and Chen Zhanbiao also stepped out of their rooms. Their gazes carried annoyance as they looked at the group at the door. When they saw these young men with hostile expressions, their eyes flashed with light, as if a child had spotted a toy.

These past days, Luo Tian had been crafting elixirs constantly; they couldn’t interrupt him. In the Luo family, they dared not wander freely but had to stay in this courtyard, guarding Lu Xing’an.

Two men who were naturally prone to trouble had been almost driven mad by boredom these past days. Now, seeing someone coming to cause trouble, they were delighted and gazed at the group approaching.

As the three of them stepped out, Luo Han and his young men wore expressions of surprise. One of them exclaimed: “It’s you!”

“Han Ge, these three are the ones who caused trouble in Xuantian City. I never thought they’d be here!” The young men behind Luo Han gasped.

“Ah, I see!” Luo Han smiled lightly, his gaze scanning the three with depth.

“Are you here to fight?” Chen Zhanbiao’s face lit up as he looked at Luo Han and his group.

“Who is Luo Tian? Come out and greet your Han Lord, your master!” The young men behind Luo Han shouted.

Chapter 544: Release the Prisoner

Luo Tian ignored the shouts of Luo Han’s group and gazed at Luo Han, nodding inwardly. Indeed, the younger generation of Ice Extreme Island was formidable. Not only Luo Han but even his group of young men were all Soul Soul Realm masters, their strength terrifying enough to dominate any sect in the Northern Region.

“Hand over Lu Xing’an, and this matter will be settled. I’ll settle it with you during the clan competition,” Luo Han said calmly, his gaze on Luo Tian.

“Do you want him?” Before Luo Tian could speak, Xu Lizi yi waved his hand and released Lu Xing’an.

Lu Xing’an had lost half his weight, his face pale and lifeless, appearing before everyone.

“Ugh…” Seeing Lu Xing’an so pitiful and soulless, Luo Tian was momentarily stunned. His gaze shifted to Xu Lizi yi and Chen Zhanbiao.

If Luo Tian hadn’t known their sexual orientation was normal, he would have thought they had done something to Lu Xing’an.

Seeing Luo Tian’s strange gaze, Xu Lizi yi and Chen Zhanbiao blushed slightly.

During the two days Luo Tian had been crafting elixirs, they had nothing to do and were bored out of their minds. Their only entertainment was tormenting Lu Xing’an.

When Chen Zhanbiao was bored, he would release Lu Xing’an to fight; when Xu Lizi yi was bored, he would curse him verbally, mentally and physically torturing Lu Xing’an into a living hell.

“You’ve gone too far!”

Seeing Lu Xing’an so wretched, the young men behind Luo Han wore expressions of anger. If it weren’t for Luo Han standing before them, they would have rushed forward.

Luo Han’s brows furrowed tightly as he scanned Xu Lizi yi and Chen Zhanbiao with a deep gaze, his cold killing intent unhidden as it surged toward them.

“Um… do you want him?” Xu Lizi yi seemed completely unaffected by Luo Han’s cold killing intent, his face showing a playful smile as he looked at Luo Han.

“What?” Luo Han laughed bitterly, his gaze coldly looking at Xu Lizi yi.

“Want him? Five million spiritual stones!” Xu Lizi yi rubbed his fingers, his gaze playful as he revealed his bandit-like nature.

“Gong…” Hearing Xu Lizi yi dare to threaten, Luo Han’s aura suddenly changed. The temperature of the entire world seemed to drop by three degrees, his cold energy rushing toward Xu Lizi yi.

“Luo Han! What are you doing? Do you really think this lineage is a soft target?” Luo Qingqing’s voice echoed from the sky, sending out waves of terror.

“Luo Qingqing?” Luo Han’s brows furrowed slightly as he looked up at the people in the sky.

In his view, over a dozen Soul Soul Realm masters followed Luo Qingqing’s later stage. Their gazes carried powerful coldness, their auras towering as they pressed toward Luo Han and his group.

These past days, the younger generation of Luo Zhan’s lineage had improved significantly with Luo Tian’s elixirs. In terms of talent, their group was no worse than other lineages; the only difference was resources.

Luo Qingqing now carried strong confidence, his Soul Soul peak realm’s power bursting forth, his powerful battle spirit pressing toward Luo Han.

“Luo Han, do you want to fight?” Luo Qingqing’s eyes carried mockery as he looked at Luo Han.

Luo Qingqing was certain that Luo Han would not dare to clash with them now. The clan competition was approaching, and although their lineage was the weakest, with Luo Tian, Xu Lizi yi, Chen Zhanbiao, and their enhanced strength, they were no worse than any other lineage.

If a fight broke out now, it would definitely result in mutual destruction, affecting their ranking in the clan competition. It might even impact their lineage’s position.

“Rustle…” Indeed, after Luo Han thought for three minutes, he waved his hand and placed five million spiritual stones before Xu Lizi yi.

Seeing Luo Han do this, the young men behind him wore expressions of surprise. They had never seen Luo Han yield before; this was the first time they witnessed his submission.

People hadn’t seen Luo Han submit for years, and their gazes naturally turned to Luo Tian and Xu Lizi yi.

Luo Qingqing’s group wore expressions of joy, for the first time in years they felt triumphant. This feeling made them feel exhilarated.

After placing the spiritual stones, Luo Han slowly walked past Luo Tian and Luo Qingqing’s group without any expression.

“Don’t do something you can’t handle; otherwise, you’ll bear the consequences. That was true back then and still holds now!” Luo Han’s voice, like a cold wind, echoed in Luo Tian’s heart.

“I am Luo Tian; I do what I want because my name is Luo Tian!” Luo Tian’s spiritual awareness transformed into a voice, resonating in Luo Han’s mind.

Luo Han said nothing but let out a light laugh, grabbing Lu Xing’an and returning to the group. His four-colored wings suddenly spread open, vanishing into the sky.

“Kid! You’ll die soon! For years, many have angered Luo Han’s elder brother, but none ended up well!” The young men who came with Luo Han said harsh words after seeing Luo Han leave, then stood up and departed.

Seeing Luo Han’s group leave in a huff, the young men accompanying Luo Qingqing wore expressions of joy. They were familiar with Luo Qingqing but had never seen Luo Tian before. However, they knew that the Luo Tian who died decades ago had returned to life and that these past days’ elixirs were given by this young man. Their faces naturally showed gratitude, greeting Luo Tian warmly.

Luo Zhen and Luo Wu stood at the front of the crowd, their faces filled with complex emotions. They felt deep gratitude and awe toward Luo Tian for giving them elixirs and dragon meat, and they revered his strength, seeing hope for their lineage’s rise.

At the same time, they didn’t know how to face Luo Tian. After all, he had slapped their father a few days ago. Even if their father was wrong, they were his sons and should avenge him.

“Everyone, don’t just stand outside; come in!” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the young men of his lineage.

Luo Qingqing led the way into the courtyard, and with her leading, others also smiled warmly, greeting Luo Tian as they entered his courtyard.

Chapter 545: The Competition Begins

On a thousand-zhang-high ice mountain of Ice Extreme Island, the place was bustling with people. This was where the clan competition took place on Ice Extreme Island, and today was the most important day for the entire island.

The clan competition occurred once every hundred years, serving as the sole means to vie for power on Ice Extreme Island. Success in it would make one the island’s leader, known as the direct lineage, while other lineages were auxiliary.

For years, ten Luo families had fought head-on over this position. Once seated on it, as long as the clan members weren’t complete fools, the position would remain with that lineage.

The direct lineage held vast power and resources; thus, becoming the direct lineage meant one could stay there indefinitely.

Back then, Luo Tian’s grandfather, Luo Xiong, had followed this path. However, after Luo Xiong’s grandfather left and Luo Nantian departed, their lineage lacked successors. Only Luo Zhan remained to resist the other lineages’ attacks, eventually being kicked off the direct lineage seat after years of struggle.

Among these, Luo Tai’s lineage had kicked them off the hardest. Today, they were the direct lineage. Luo Tai’s lineage had been patient and waiting for years until Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian left, then erupted in the clan competition.

At this moment, people from all lineages had gradually emerged from their families, arriving at their seats with excitement.

“Ha ha! Everyone is early!” Luo Tai smiled and greeted the people from various lineages.

“Island leader, greetings!” People bowed respectfully, as the competition hadn’t started yet; Luo Tai was still the island leader and deserved respect.

But everyone’s hearts were filled with mockery, looking at Luo Tai, hoping to dethrone him today. After all, Luo Tai’s lineage had only held the position for less than a hundred years; their foundation wasn’t deep. If they stayed for thousands of years, it would be difficult.

Thus, this clan competition was the best opportunity. If Luo Tai’s lineage remained in power, it would become increasingly difficult each time unless they had two strong warriors like Luo Xiong before.

“Alright, everyone seems to have arrived. Should we send a message to the ancestors?” Luo Tai smiled and looked around at the other lineages, but inwardly he sneered.

“Hmm…” After exchanging greetings with each other, the other lineages nodded slightly and didn’t want to waste more time.

“Seems Luo Zhan’s lineage hasn’t arrived yet!” Someone in the crowd shouted, their face filled with amusement.

Hearing this person’s call, people wore smiles. Now, Luo Zhan’s lineage had almost been forgotten. They only knew that a few days ago, Luo Xiong’s grandson returned and caused quite a stir. But they thought he was just a little kid, nothing special.

“I think we don’t need to wait. Whether they come or not, it’s the same. If their lineage still finishes last this year, they’ll be expelled from Ice Extreme Island and have to deal with outside matters!” A senior from an auxiliary lineage spoke, his face filled with nostalgia.

“Yes, give them some dignity!” Others also looked with nostalgia, recalling how powerful Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian had been. Now they were reduced to this.

Hearing people’s murmurs, Luo Tai nodded slightly and took out a token from his sleeve. This token was the Island Leader’s Token, the only way to contact the ancestors of Ice Extreme Island.

“Wait!” Just as Luo Tai was about to activate the token, a young voice echoed from afar. The sound of breaking air spread out, and figures flew toward them.

“Finally, they’ve come!” Luo Tai’s brows furrowed slightly as he looked at the figure who had landed and approached. He muttered softly.

“Huh? Where is Luo Zhan?” People looked at the newcomers with confusion.

Luo Tian and Luo Qingqing led their lineage’s people from afar, followed by Luo Qingqing and the younger members of the Luo family. Some middle-aged people also trailed behind them, their gazes filled with a hint of evasion.

“Kid, you’re Luo Tian, right? The one who caused trouble in Xuanbing City?” Seeing Luo Tian, Luo Tai smiled.

Luo Tian said nothing, his face showing a smile: “This junior is Luo Tian! I’m sure the elder won’t hold any grudges over trivial matters!”

“Ah, of course not!” Seeing Luo Tian had made it clear, Luo Tai smiled but his eyes flickered slightly.

“Kid, where is Luo Zhan? Why did you send this child instead?” A loud voice echoed out. An elder spoke, his face filled with impatience.

“This is the second-ranking lineage from last competition. His name is Luo Bao, and he’s the biggest threat to Luo Tai’s lineage this time!” Luo Qingqing spoke, informing Luo Tian of the person’s identity.

Luo Tian didn’t answer Luo Bao but surveyed around, his expression slightly tense and serious.

His spiritual awareness sensed the presence of Luo family members, their auras powerful. The weakest was even at the Spirit Soul Initial Stage. Clearly, Ice Extreme Island’s strength had been formidable; Luo Tian calculated in his mind that this force could easily dominate all sects in the Northern Region.

“You guys came here to humiliate us? Your elders didn’t come, so your lineage really has no one left. Sending a child to represent you—Luo Zhan must be getting more active!” People wore mocking expressions, looking at Luo Tian and Luo Qingqing’s group.

“Yes! Without Luo Zhan, how can you participate in the clan competition?” Luo Tai also looked puzzled and asked.

“Ha ha… I’m sorry for keeping you waiting! Did I arrive late?” Just as people were discussing, a loud laugh echoed out. Before the words finished, Luo Zhan’s figure appeared in their view.

“Luo Zhan!”

“Soul Severance Realm!” Seeing Luo Zhan, people furrowed their brows slightly, gazing at the powerful aura radiating from Luo Zhan in the sky.

“Unexpectedly, even this lineage has reached such a low point, yet he’s managed to break into the Soul Severance Realm!” People murmured again.

With Luo Zhan entering the Soul Severance Realm, the brows of those ranked lower in the clan leaders furrowed slightly. These leaders were all at the Soul Severance Realm, and now Luo Zhan’s entry posed a significant threat to them.

This plot is something I dreamed of, do you believe it?

Chapter 546: The Ancestors Arrive

Seeing Luo Zhan arrive, Luo Tian and Luo Qingqing sighed in relief. If Luo Zhan hadn’t come, Luo Tian wouldn’t have had the confidence to win first place in the clan competition.

These past days, Luo Tian had listened to Luo Qingqing’s introduction of the competition rules. The competition consisted of three rounds: the first and second were individual battles, one between Soul Severance Realm and Spirit Soul Realm.

Each lineage would select a young warrior of the Spirit Soul Realm to fight, and the one who won first place in this round would be the winner of the first stage. The second round was a Soul Severance Realm battle, i.e., each lineage’s Soul Severance Realm combat.

The third round was a chaotic battle among the younger generation, with each family sending ten young disciples. Their cultivation level didn’t matter, but their age had to be under a hundred years. They would fight in waves, and the team that won first place in this round would be the third stage’s winner.

Those who won two rounds would be the first place of this clan competition. If no one managed to win two rounds, the ancestors would decide based on each lineage’s situation and potential.

Luo Zhan entering the Soul Severance Realm meant Luo Tian was confident he wouldn’t be the weakest. Even if Luo Zhan couldn’t match those few, he wasn’t the bottom. After all, Luo Zhan had once entered the Soul Severance Realm battle with Spirit Soul Peak and now truly entered it, his combat power would surely rise to the point of terrifying others.

Plus with himself, Luo Tian was confident he could win the Spirit Soul Realm’s first place. Thus, this time, Luo Zhan’s lineage would definitely not be the weakest. However, Luo Tian’s goal wasn’t just to prevent their lineage from being expelled but to win first place and obtain the flag to enter Ice Extreme Island’s depths, seeking the Qianshan Xuanbing Su.

Luo Zhan smiled as he approached Luo Tian and Luo Qingqing, speaking softly: “Today is the day our lineage rises!”

“Ah… entering the Soul Severance Realm and thinking yourself important. You really follow your lineage’s tradition, like that kid who thought Ice Extreme Island was his backyard and acted recklessly!” Luo Zhan’s words had just finished when an unharmonious voice echoed out.

“Luo Hu! You’re insulting our lineage; do you dare to fight me now?” Luo Zhan’s face turned cold as he looked toward the speaker.

“Whether fish die or not, I don’t know, but I do know the net won’t break!” Luo Hu’s face showed a hint of disdain.

Luo Hu was the third-ranking lineage from last competition, also one of Luo Tai’s supporters. It was due to this lineage’s support that Luo Tai’s lineage had won first place in the initial competition.

Luo Tian also looked at the elder who spoke, and Luo Qingqing had already conveyed all ten lineage’s information through spiritual awareness to Luo Tian.

“Hmph! Then do you want to try?” Luo Zhan sneered, his aura pressing toward Luo Hu.

“Then I’ll see what strength you have to dare act so arrogantly here! Your family has no one left except Luo Xiong and that kid, Lu Nantian!” Luo Hu countered sharply, his gaze still filled with disdain.

“Ah… when my elder brother Luo Xiong and Lu Nantian were around, did you dare speak to me like this? You’re a dog with no sense!” Luo Zhan sneered.

Five forms of energy waves formed before the two, even causing Luo Tian and others to wobble slightly.

“Soul Severance Realm masters are truly powerful!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He was confident he could crush even a Spirit Soul Peak master, but against a Soul Severance Realm master, he had no chance at all. Not even the courage to flee.

Soul Severance Realm transcended Spirit Soul Realm; even in the Northern Region’s sects, they would be considered a foundation.

“Weng…” Just as the two’s auras were about to collide, several stronger fluctuations suddenly appeared in the sky. Several elders gazed at the people below with authority.

As the elders arrived, Luo Zhan and Luo Hu quickly suppressed their auras, their gazes filled with respect as they looked at the people in the sky.

“Respect the ancestors!” Everyone knelt on the ground, their gazes filled with respect as they spoke loudly.

“Hmph… get up,” the elders said softly, then sat on seats already prepared for them.

“Luo Tai, start the competition!” One elder spoke, his gaze filled with a gentle expression as he looked at everyone below.

“Spirit Soul Realm, no less than the aura of my mother!” Luo Tian looked at the elders, his gaze filled with admiration.

As he gazed at them, the elders also looked at Luo Tian briefly before their gazes carried a hint of joy.

Indeed, the current direct lineage of Ice Extreme Island were all descendants of these elders. However, with time passing, the bloodline strength had gradually thinned. Whenever a lineage produced an extraordinary genius, these elders would notice it.

Back then, Luo Tian’s Five Elements Body had been highly valued by the elders, who even decided to unite and personally teach Luo Tian when he grew up. But they hadn’t expected such an event.

“This kid, looks good. He seems more promising than his grandfather and father!” One elder spoke, his gaze filled with satisfaction.

Luo Xiong and Luo Nantian had been the elders’ favored ones, so they paid more attention. Later, with Luo Tian’s Five Elements Body appearing, the elders had focused even more on Luo Xiong’s lineage.

“Unfortunately, Luo Xiong has been missing for years; where did he go? Luo Nantian, that little bastard, went to guard the ice mountain! If they were here, I’m sure the elders from the Southern Region wouldn’t have stayed hidden; Ice Extreme Island would definitely be the top sect!” Another elder spoke, his gaze filled with nostalgia.

“Yes, a few days ago I went to check on that kid; his aura was no less than us old-timers! I don’t know how he cultivated it!” The elders murmured, their gazes filled with nostalgia as they looked toward the depths of Ice Extreme Island.

At this moment, Luo Nantian and his wife’s gazes were filled with excitement as they watched the clan competition. They believed their son could lead their fallen family to reclaim Ice Extreme Island’s position.

“Alright, I’ll announce the competition has begun. The first and second rounds will be held simultaneously!” An elder spoke.

As the words finished, several elders raised their hands, and a towering aura burst from them, forming a barrier that enclosed the entire Ice Extreme Island. Even the ground was protected.

Chapter 547: Spirit Soul Battle

Under everyone’s gaze, the nearly two-zhang-long square was divided into two parts by several elders, each enclosed in a barrier.

“First round is an individual battle; each family should send their disciples forward!” An elder spoke, his voice filled with authority.

With people’s expectant gazes, ten families each had disciples step forward to the top of their respective groups.

Luo Zhan’s lineage, Luo Qingqing wore a smile and took two steps back, letting Luo Tian step forward.

Seeing Luo Qingqing’s action, Luo Tian didn’t hesitate but strode confidently to the front of the crowd.

“Is that Luo Tian? I never thought his lineage would send him to compete so soon!”

“Yes! Why didn’t they send Luo Qingqing? Has their lineage given up?” Seeing Luo Zhan’s lineage not sending Luo Tian, people wore expressions of confusion.

Last year’s Spirit Soul battle had been won by Luo Qingqing, who placed third and saved their lineage from expulsion. Today, they sent a Luo Tian who had only returned for less than a month to compete, leaving people astonished.

Luo Han stood at the front of Luo Tai’s lineage, his gaze deep as he looked at Luo Tian. His finger lightly waved toward him.

Luo Han’s status in Ice Extreme Island was high; he was the top of the younger generation, undefeated. In the entire Southern Region, he could rank in the top ten and naturally received much attention.

When people saw Luo Han waving his finger toward Luo Tian, they were even more confused, looking at the thin but calm-faced Luo Tian.

“Weng…” A spiritual energy fluctuation spread from the ten disciples’ feet, and in an instant, they appeared on the battlefield before everyone. These ten people stood opposite each other, facing a young man from another lineage.

Luo Tian was no exception; he faced a strong young man with an arrogant expression.

“This must be my first opponent!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, looking at the young man opposite him.

“Kid, you’re unlucky!” The strong young man shouted.

“Unlucky? I’ve met Luo Feihong!” Luo Zhan’s lineage young men wore expressions of anxiety, seeing Luo Tian face this opponent.

They only knew that Luo Tian was a powerful seventh-rank alchemist but didn’t know his strength. When Lu Xing’an was captured, it was Chen Zhanbiao who had done it; they hadn’t seen Luo Tian fight.

“Fang Xin, no problem!” Luo Zhen and Luo Wu wore smiles; they had been knocked away by Luo Tian’s slap before, so they knew his power. However, due to face, they didn’t dare say it out loud.

“Luo Feihong?” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, looking at the elders on the high platform. This was clearly testing him.

From Luo Tian’s understanding, this Luo Feihong was the strongest young disciple of Luo Hu’s lineage and ranked fourth in strength. Now that Luo Qingqing and Lu Xing’an weren’t participating, he was considered second only to Luo Han in people’s minds.

“Haha! Luo Zhan, your luck isn’t good!” Luo Hu smiled and mocked.

“Hmph! Don’t be too happy before the result is out!” Luo Zhan sneered, responding.

“Alright, I won’t argue with you. Once the result is out, you’ll regret coming here today!” Luo Hu didn’t say more but took a step forward.

At the same time, Luo Tai and other clan leaders were transported to another square, standing opposite each other. Strangely, Luo Zhan and Luo Hu also stood on opposing sides.

People looked at the elders high above, clearly this was their intention. People secretly wondered what these elders were thinking.

After Luo Tian and others stood in place, the elders waved their hands again, forming barriers to isolate them.

“Begin!” Before Luo Tian could react, the old voice echoed in everyone’s ears.

“Die!” Luo Feihong laughed and grabbed his axes, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Just you?” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly. His feet swirled with wind, and he took a step forward using the Sealing Steps, appearing before Luo Feihong. He launched a punch with the Destruction of Life.

Luo Feihong saw Luo Tian vanish before his eyes and his face changed, quickly using his axe to block his chest.

“Peng…” In an instant, the strong young man’s body was sent flying backward, and with his flight, a thousand years of vitality vanished.

“An earth-grade initial axe? Not bad!” Luo Tian sighed, looking at the axe in Luo Feihong’s hand. He felt regret; otherwise, this punch would have broken his bones and torn his tendons.

The crowd watching the fight wore expressions of surprise, gazing at Luo Tian. They hadn’t expected that Luo Tian had knocked out the formidable Luo Feihong with just one punch.
