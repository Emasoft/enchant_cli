Brilliant light flared up, as Ma Tianyang's hand now held a long halberd, while Jin Tianlu's grip tightened around a long sword. Two golden beams of light surged forward, charging at Luo Tian with murderous intent.

"What are they doing? How dare they attack during the Grand Competition of the Mountain-Sea Pavilion!" The crowd gasped, their voices rising in alarm as they beheld the lethal aura radiating from the two combatants.

"Ah?" Du Hongtao's brows furrowed slightly, his gaze shifting to Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu. A flicker of displeasure crossed his face, and he was about to intervene when Ma Feiyang stepped forward with a respectful demeanor.

"Master, if we cannot eliminate this boy today, I shall no longer target him," Ma Feiyang said, his eyes pleading as he met Du Hongtao's gaze.

"Children are merely playing; do not take it so seriously!" Jin Jingtian smiled, raising a hand to block Du Hongtao's movement.

Du Hongtao cast a long glance at Luo Tian, who stood calmly. He gave a single nod: "This once; if there is a next time, he shall be executed without mercy."

"What's going on? Master Du hasn't stopped them. Does he intend to let the marriage competition be ruined?" The crowd murmured, watching Du Hongtao seated in silence.

"Shameful!" Dou Yuying's face flushed with anger, her small fists clenching as she glared at Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu. She was clearly upset, even showing eagerness to intervene.

Lu Tianyu frowned slightly, puzzled by why Dou Yuying had spoken to Luo Tian. He reached out and pulled her back.

"What are you doing?" Lu Tianyu's voice carried a hint of indulgence as he gently patted Dou Yuying's head, calming her.

"Big Brother Lu, they're fighting one against two. That youth is clearly in the process of refining his elixir; how can he face both? Please help!" Dou Yuying lifted her face, eyes pleading.

"Enough. You don't need to interfere. Master Du hasn't stopped them for a reason. Let's not get involved. I've already cast a fortune for this boy—he won't die soon," Lu Tianyu lied, addressing Dou Yuying.

Dou Yuying's brows furrowed slightly but she trusted Lu Tianyu implicitly, their relationship clearly close.

"Big Brother Lu, help me check—will he be my future husband?" Dou Yuying blushed unexpectedly, addressing Lu Tianyu.

Lu Tianyu felt a headache coming on as he patted her head: "You're still young; don't think about such things..."

As they spoke, Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu had already closed in on Luo Tian. Their eyes gleamed with murderous intent, but instead of attacking Luo Tian directly, they aimed for the golden elixir hovering above.

They knew defeating Luo Tian would take time. It was wiser to first eliminate the elixir.

A hundred zhang distance—mere blink of an eye for them. Yet, the gray-cloaked Luo Tian wore a faint smile as he stood before them.

"Die!" Luo Tian sneered, his golden elixir radiating brilliant light. Two fists shot forth, splitting the void and striking the two men.

"Fast!" The sudden appearance of Luo Tian left Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu stunned.

In their momentary hesitation, Luo Tian's fists struck them squarely, sending shockwaves through their minds.

Yet these two were disciples of the three great sects. Their half-step Saint strength was no ordinary feat. They raised their halberd and sword, blocking Luo Tian's punches.

The thunderous clash echoed. Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu lost the initiative, their bodies flying backward with grim expressions.

"Destroy my elixir—first I'll destroy you!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with cold determination. His body shimmered like a golden phoenix, his Saintly power radiating as he materialized before Jin Tianlu.

With a hand gesture, a golden seal formed in Luo Tian's palm. It shot forth with an aura of destruction, crushing Jin Tianlu.

"I am also a half-step Saint. To injure me—dream on!" Jin Tianlu's face twisted with madness. Having lost to Luo Tian in alchemy, he refused to lose in strength. He launched his attack with all his might.

"You and I have no grudge, yet you provoke me repeatedly. First mocking my alchemy, then disrupting it. Today, if you don't shed skin, I am not Luo Tian!" Luo Tian's hands moved swiftly, forming new seals.

Jin Tianlu's eyes burned with madness. His sword slashed downward, instantly shattering Luo Tian's opening strike. A golden toad shadow materialized above Jin Tianlu, its tongue flicking out toward Luo Tian.

"Golden Toad Devours Heaven!" Jin Tianlu sneered, his voice carrying an odd resonance. The golden toad solidified in the sky, leaping toward Luo Tian with its tongue.

"Five Seals United—Crush Heaven!" Luo Tian's hands glowed, the power of destruction radiating as five seals converged, crushing down on the golden toad.

"Kid, don't forget I'm here. Today you die!" A cold voice echoed as a purple mountain thundered forth, splitting the void with an aura of annihilation.

"Today I'll show you what true talent is. What it means to be invincible at your level!" Luo Tian's voice was cold as he faced the purple mountain, unafraid.

Lightning crackled around Luo Tian's body. His golden aura blazed like the sun, his eyes burning with battle spirit. This was his first fight in Fire Domain against its top talents. He wanted to win utterly, leaving them with an indelible fear of his might.

Faced with the purple mountain, Luo Tian stood firm. His overwhelming aura radiated outward as his long arms formed a heaven-lifting stance, awaiting the mountain's descent.

"Is he mad? To face Ma Tianyang's technique with his body!" The crowd below was stunned, watching Luo Tian single-handedly withstand two disciples. Their minds were shaken.

"Die!" Ma Tianyang's face was cold. He knew even a half-step Saint would suffer grievous wounds from this technique.

"Boom..." Like the end of days, the purple mountain crashed onto Luo Tian's hands. The Mountain-Sea Pavilion's platform, once a hundred zhang high with intricate formations, now sank dozens of zhang under the immense pressure.

The sky above saw the golden Heaven-Shaking Seal clash with Jin Tianlu's Golden Toad technique. A thunderous roar echoed through the sky, the golden toad crying out before disintegrating. The Heaven-Shaking Seal pressed on toward Jin Tianlu.

Though the seal's power remained overwhelming, it was partially blocked by the golden toad. Jin Tianlu merely slashed once, shattering the seal.

"Ha! Kid, how's my technique?" Ma Tianyang smiled, sensing life within the purple mountain. He knew Luo Tian hadn't died.

Yet Ma Tianyang was confident. Even if Luo Tian survived, enduring his full power would leave him severely wounded. Then, under their combined attack, Luo Tian was doomed.

Silence fell as all watched the purple mountain. The heavy aura made people tremble.

"Uh, Luo Xiong, is there no problem?" Xu Zhengwen asked his companion Long Jie, voice trembling.

When Xu Zhengwen looked at Long Jie, he found his eyes dazed. He sighed inwardly—Luo Tian might truly be in trouble.

"Is that elixir tasty? It looks delicious. If it's refined, I'll have my brother make it for me every day! Hehe!" Long Jie's eyes gleamed with greed, his gaze fixed on the dazzling elixir.

"Ugh!" Xu Zhengwen nearly spat blood. His brother was fighting disciples, yet this boy was thinking about eating an elixir—truly absurd.

"Hey, did you hear me?" Xu Zhengwen prodded Long Jie gently.

"Hmm." Long Jie swallowed, nodded at Xu Zhengwen. He patted Xu Zhengwen's shoulder with a mature air: "Don't worry. If I reached half-step Saint, I could take them down too. Let alone my brother!"

Xu Zhengwen's lips curled. He sighed at these brothers, treating disciples as if they were easy prey.

"Make way!" A low roar echoed beneath the purple mountain, drawing Xu Zhengwen's gaze back to the platform.

Lightning crackled. A deep dragon roar echoed from beneath the mountain. In people's stunned view, a figure proportionally mismatched with the purple mountain emerged.

Kneeling on one knee, Luo Tian pushed hard. The solid platform cracked again. Simultaneously, his body straightened, eyes cold as he lifted the purple mountain with both hands.

"Crush!" Luo Tian sneered, his arms bulging. He gritted his teeth and in an instant, the massive purple mountain soared into the air.

With a light step, Luo Tian's body became a golden blur. A deep dragon roar echoed from within him.

"Crack..." A punch shot out, embodying a supreme warrior's might. The golden fist collided with the purple mountain, splitting the heavens like breaking glass. A thunderous sound echoed in people's ears.

The purple mountain shattered under Luo Tian's full power, dispersing into swirling violet mist across the sky.

"It's my turn!" Luo Tian exhaled, his eyes playful as he gazed at Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu. His hands glowed again.

Golden light flared, the Heaven-Shaking Seal forming once more in Luo Tian's palm. It shot forth toward the two men.

"Ha! With this seal technique, you think you can harm us? How naive!" Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu sneered.

Luo Tian's Heaven-Shaking Seal was formidable against one opponent, but two? It was insufficient.

"Indeed, it's not enough," Luo Tian muttered, his hands unceasing. Golden script transformed into a golden dragon, bursting forth from his palm.

"Vajra Attack!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with confidence. The golden script dragon roared, entwining the Heaven-Shaking Seal.

"Boom..." A heavy sound echoed. The golden seal, now swollen in size, radiated terrifying pressure, overwhelming everyone's minds.

"Three times?" Luo Tian shook his head slightly, unimpressed with the Vajra Attack he'd unleashed. Ancient Tianshu had once launched five times the power, crushing his enemies.

Though unimpressed, the Heaven-Shaking Seal had tripled in attack power, leaving people stunned. Especially Du Hongtao, Lu Han Tian, and Jin Jingtian—eyes wide as they watched Luo Tian's Vajra Attack.

All three were at the early Saint stage, easily overpowering half-step Saints. Yet they felt a hint of danger from the Heaven-Shaking Seal enhanced by Vajra Attack.

"This... attack has tripled!" Du Hongtao's eyes flashed with intensity, shifting to contemplation.

"Vajra Attack! This kid truly obtained Tianshu's inheritance!" Jin Jingtian gasped, disbelief in his eyes.

"This journey was worth it. I've witnessed both the legendary Heaven-Shaking Alchemy and Vajra Attack!" Lu Han Tian's face bore a wistful expression.

"Reckless! What is this kid's origin? He's so reckless, boosting attack power threefold. It's terrifying!" The elders behind the three sect masters bore expressions of disbelief.

"What in the world is this?" Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu stared at the massive seal, fear etched on their faces.

Standing beneath it, they felt its immense pressure. Even as half-step Saints, they struggled to breathe.

"Block it!" They both roared, their dan fields thundering. No longer holding back, they unleashed their sacred artifacts.

Golden light flared as a red banner with flame patterns materialized in Ma Tianyang's hand. He waved it, releasing golden flames that surged toward the Heaven-Shaking Seal.

On the other side, Jin Tianlu unleashed his might. Golden light radiated from his palm. The toad's croak echoed again as it appeared before the crowd, its mouth opening to spit a golden coin-like object. The toad disintegrated into the coin.

"Buzz..." Jin Tianlu's hands moved slightly. The golden coin cleaved through the sky, rushing toward the golden seal.

"Flies dare to challenge a tree! You truly think I'm targeting you? How high you overestimate yourselves!" Luo Tian's eyes sneered, gazing at the swirling storm clouds above.

A ripple spread. A golden hand formed, a power equivalent to a Saint's strike descending from the sky toward the platform.

"That's an elixir's heavenly trial!" People gazed at the golden hand, realization dawning. They'd been so engrossed in the three's battle they'd forgotten Luo Tian hadn't yet passed his elixir trial.

In an instant, Luo Tian guided the Heaven-Shaking Seal upward, pressing against the descending golden hand.

Meanwhile, Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu's faces darkened. They hadn't expected Luo Tian's target to be the golden hand from the elixir trial.

Even more infuriating, their attacks had already been launched and locked onto Luo Tian's Heaven-Shaking Seal. Thus, the golden flames and sacred coin followed the seal toward the golden hand.

In a flash, the golden hand collided with the three attacks.

"Crack..." Thunderous explosions erupted. The sky above shattered, revealing endless stars. The Mountain-Sea Pavilion trembled three times, as if the world had ended. The sky darkened, and waves of gray energy swept over everyone. Those with low cultivation were crushed to the ground by this terrifying force.

"Blocked!" People's eyes lit up with relief, watching the golden hand shatter from the Heaven-Shaking Seal. It was then consumed by flames and finally shattered by the sacred coin.

"Is it about to be refined as a Sacred-grade Intermediate Elixir?" The crowd roared, witnessing the rare event of a Sacred-grade Intermediate Elixir being refined.

Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu's faces were grim. They hadn't expected their full-power strike to become a tool for Luo Tian.

"Thanks! Though you didn't help much, at least you tried!" Luo Tian smiled, not missing the chance to mock them.

"Kid, a Sacred-grade Intermediate Elixir isn't easy to refine. Be serious!" Lu Han Tian's laughter echoed, drawing people's attention back to the sky.

The platform of the Mountain-Sea Pavilion was now unrecognizable. Once a hundred zhang high with intricate formations, it had sunk dozens of zhang under the immense pressure. People's eyes widened in awe.

"Still not over?" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed, understanding that the previous golden hand was merely comparable to the power of a Saint-grade elixir. His Sacred-grade Intermediate Elixir would be more challenging.

"Kid, we've already blocked the first strike. Let's see how you block the second heavenly trial!" Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu sneered, their bodies surging forward.

"Rubbish!" Luo Tian's hands moved swiftly. The Heaven-Shaking Seal, enhanced by the Vajra Attack, formed again. His eyes flashed with cold determination as he pushed the seal into the sky.

"Ha! Alone, you still can't shake that Saint-level attack!" Ma Tianyang's face was triumphant. He seized every opportunity to mock Luo Tian.

"Who said so? This is for blocking the heavenly trial!" Luo Tian's eyes sneered. He pressed his hands into the void.

"Buzz..." A ripple spread. The golden seal, like a star, descended with overwhelming pressure toward Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu.

"Damn!" Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu, still mocking Luo Tian, hadn't expected this time his target was them. The immense pressure instantly fell upon their bodies.

They knew the Heaven-Shaking Seal's terror and didn't dare to delay. The red banner flared again, and the golden coin was unleashed.

But their haste weakened the attack's power compared to before.

After unleashing the Heaven-Shaking Seal, Luo Tian ignored Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu. His eyes glowed with intensity as he watched the golden hand descend toward the Nine-Revolution Flame Elixir.

The golden hand's pressure was even stronger than Luo Tian's Heaven-Shaking Seal. It descended with a wave of destruction.

"Shake the Heavens!" Luo Tian pointed his finger, golden Saintly power surged into the elixir.

"Ugh..." A mournful sound echoed. The golden Nine-Revolution Flame Elixir spun rapidly, radiating golden Saintly power that formed a "Heaven" character. The golden hand moved toward it.

Thunderous explosions echoed again, shaking people's minds like thunderclaps. The Heaven-Shaking Seal shattered the fire sea, crushing the sacred coin and descending upon Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu's heads. Their bodies were crushed, unknown if they lived or died.

Meanwhile, the "Heaven" character collided with the golden hand. The character shattered instantly.

"It's shattered! It seems this elixir will be destroyed!" People's faces bore disappointment. They hadn't expected it to fail, but if not for Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu's interference, Luo Tian might have succeeded by focusing all his strength on the heavenly trial.

"Cough... cough..." Two weakened figures rose from the dust, their faces pale. They spat blood, clearly suffering heavy injuries.

"Kid, you've failed!" Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu, in their wretched state, gazed at the golden hand that hadn't lessened. Their eyes gleamed with satisfaction.

Luo Tian watched the shattered character, his face devoid of emotion. Hearing them rise so quickly, he raised an eyebrow: "Eat and forget!"

He moved swiftly, appearing before them. His foot shot out, stomping Jin Tianlu underfoot. His other hand lifted Ma Tianyang.

Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu, severely injured, had no chance to resist. They were subdued by Luo Tian.

"What are you doing?" Ma Tianyang, confident in Du Hongtao and Jin Jingtian's protection, knew they wouldn't let anything happen to the disciples of the three great sects.

"Beating you!" Luo Tian swung his hand, slapping Ma Tianyang's face.

Teeth fell out. The invincible half-step Saint body, under Luo Tian's slap, swelled significantly.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian's foot crushed Jin Tianlu's head. Stones burst out, driving Jin Tianlu's head into the platform.

People stared at Luo Tian in awe. To openly humiliate disciples before the three sect masters was unprecedented since the three sects controlled Fire Domain.

Yet people felt a flicker of satisfaction. They weren't pleased with the disciples' actions.

"Good job!" Dou Yuying's eyes sparkled as she watched Luo Tian's overwhelming power. Lu Tianyu sighed again, at a loss with this girl. She was clapping while beating their sect's disciples—how could he explain that?

Indeed, Du Hongtao and Jin Jingtian's faces darkened. A strong killing intent locked onto Luo Tian, especially Jin Jingtian. His early Saint-level pressure instantly pressed toward Luo Tian.

Feeling their change, Luo Tian's body slightly sank but didn't loosen his grip on Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu.

"Kid, release them. Otherwise, you won't bear the consequences!" Jin Jingtian soared into the air, descending onto the platform.

At the same time, Du Hongtao stood on the platform with a grim face. His gaze fell on Luo Tian: "Young man, don't overstep. You have some talent, but the Mountain-Sea Pavilion isn't a place for you to run wild!"

"Pf!" Luo Tian sneered, not loosening Ma Tianyang. He twisted Ma Tianyang's head.

"Open your dog eyes and see how I refine this elixir!" Luo Tian's voice carried confidence, redirecting people's attention to the sky.

"This..." People were stunned. Their eyes held intense disbelief.

Above, the "Heaven" character shattered by the golden hand had, at some point, transformed into golden dragons. They wrapped around the golden hand.

"This is the true Heaven-Shaking Alchemy Method!" Luo Tian's voice echoed, causing Du Hongtao and Jin Jingtian to shudder. Their eyes held intense shock.

Luo Tian's words had barely finished when the sky erupted with brilliant light. The script chains instantly contracted, shattering the golden hand that had nearly killed a half-step Saint. It scattered into golden light across the sky.

The golden elixir spun rapidly, gathering golden light. It radiated terrifying pressure, like a king of the heavens and earth.

The heavy storm clouds dissipated after the second strike. People were awestruck.

"It's successful!" The crowd erupted in excitement, watching the golden elixir glowing. Witnessing a Sacred-grade elixir's refinement was enough to stir their souls.

Luo Tian waved his hand, seizing the sacred elixir and sealing it. He tossed it toward Du Hongtao.

"Master Du, did I win this Grand Competition? Can you give me the golden book now?" Luo Tian spoke seriously.

Du Hongtao's brows furrowed slightly. He would honor his promise. Golden light flickered, and the golden chronicle fragment was sent to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's eyes flashed with joy, but he quickly hid it. Now wasn't the time to ponder.

Yet his expression and actions were noticed by people. His eagerness to obtain the golden fragment suggested he knew its use.

"Alright, now let's discuss how to handle these two. They've troubled me repeatedly. I'm sure you can see clearly, so please give me an explanation!" Luo Tian smiled, patting Ma Tianyang.

"Gasps..." People gazed at Luo Tian in disbelief. They hadn't expected him to demand an explanation from the three sects after everything was done.

The three sects had always ruled Fire Domain. Now, a disciple was humiliated before all Fire Domain sects and even the three masters. This was unprecedented. Now this boy demanded an explanation from the three sects' masters. If not for Luo Tian's previous performance proving his talent, people would have thought him a fool.

"What did you say?" Jin Jingtian's eyes flashed with danger. He seemed to have misheard.

"I said I want an explanation. Didn't you hear?" Luo Tian's face still held a smile, then he stomped Jin Tianlu's head again. His foot sank deeper into the ground.

"Die!" Jin Jingtian's face flashed with killing intent. He extended his hand, pressing toward Luo Tian with overwhelming power—no less than the heavenly trial.

Du Hongtao remained motionless, watching Jin Jingtian's hand descend. Luo Tian's talent had crossed his line.

Feeling Jin Jingtian's palm, Luo Tian showed no fear: "You'd better retract your claws. Otherwise, you'll regret it. Have you heard of Gu Tianshu?"

"Rippling wind..." The breeze blew Luo Tian's robe, but Jin Jingtian's hand halted. His eyes flashed with intense light as he gazed at Luo Tian.

The platform of the Mountain-Sea Pavilion was now unrecognizable. Once a hundred zhang high with intricate formations, it had sunk dozens of zhang under the immense pressure. People's eyes widened in awe.

"Have you heard of Gu Tianshu?" Luo Tian's calm voice echoed, still standing there. His hand held Ma Tianyang, his foot stepped on Jin Tianlu.

Luo Tian's words made Jin Jingtian halt his hand, surprise in his eyes.

"Who... who did you say?" Jin Jingtian's voice trembled with question.

Du Hongtao, hearing Gu Tianshu's name, changed expression. He recognized the techniques Luo Tian had used as those of Gu Tianshu's legendary skills. They thought Luo Tian had obtained his inheritance.

Now, by invoking Gu Tianshu's name, the situation was more complex than they'd imagined.

"Gu Tianshu. You've surely heard of him, right?" Luo Tian's voice echoed again. He sighed inwardly—Gu Tianshu had truly been extraordinary. Even after so many years, invoking his name still intimidated a master at the early Saint stage.

"Gu Tianshu. We've heard of him, but what does it have to do with you? You've merely inherited Gu Tianshu's sect master's legacy. How long has he been in seclusion? Do you think invoking his name today will save your life?" Jin Jingtian's voice carried disdain but he didn't continue his attack.

The crowd below was confused. Hearing Gu Tianshu's name, they were puzzled—how could Fire Domain have such a power? Just by invoking his name, even a master at the early Saint stage was wary.

As Luo Tian's voice echoed, Gu Tianshu's name spread. Eventually, someone's eyes widened as they recounted Gu Tianshu's legendary feats.

"Gu Tianshu. I didn't expect Fire Domain to have such a power! It's a pity he's been in seclusion for so long!" People sighed, gazing at Luo Tian. They wondered why he invoked Gu Tianshu's name.

"Who said he was in seclusion? Have you seen it?" Luo Tian sneered at Jin Jingtian, his voice proud. He was clearly someone who knew much.

"What proof do you have?" Jin Jingtian, seeing Luo Tian's confidence, thought of the previous techniques Gu Tianshu had used and Luo Tian's past. Fire Domain seemed to have suddenly appeared with this name, with no prior history.

Such extraordinary power—how could he reach it without a deep background?

Doubt formed in Jin Jingtian and Du Hongtao's eyes. They watched Luo Tian cautiously.

"Gu Tianshu is my master. What proof do you want? The Heaven-Shaking Alchemy Method and Vajra Attack are enough, right?" Luo Tian, sensing their doubt, spoke loudly.

Luo Tian had noticed Du Hongtao and Jin Jingtian's reactions when he used the Heaven-Shaking Alchemy Method and Vajra Attack. He had planned to use Gu Tianshu's name to intimidate the three sect masters, ensuring his safety.

Du Hongtao and Jin Jingtian fell silent. Though unsure if Luo Tian's words were true, they knew today they couldn't harm him. They needed to investigate whether Gu Tianshu was still alive. If he was, the news would be shocking—possibly alarming the top masters of the three sects.

"What explanation do you want?" Jin Jingtian spoke seriously. Since he couldn't act, only to compromise. If Luo Tian was truly Gu Tianshu's disciple, even if he killed Jin Tianlu, they could only endure.

"I don't want an explanation. Now I just want to see how solid the face of these so-called disciples is!" Luo Tian smiled, knowing Du Hongtao and Jin Jingtian's hesitation. His foot stomped again on Jin Tianlu's head, while his hand swung repeatedly, slapping Ma Tianyang's face. Thunderous sounds echoed across the platform.

People watched this arrogant Luo Tian, their mouths twitching. They sighed inwardly—this master was truly lawless.

Jin Jingtian and Du Hongtao's faces were grim as they watched Luo Tian beating Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu. Yet, they dared not act. The high-and-mighty masters had never felt so oppressed.

Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu were furious. Who could endure being beaten in front of most Fire Domain sects? Especially as high-ranking disciples.

Xu Zhengwen and others from the Piercing Cloud Sect had expressions of amazement. Xu Zhengwen hadn't expected Luo Tian to have such a deep background.

Ding Pengzu and Xie Zizhen were shocked. They also regretted their earlier arrogance. If they had built a good relationship with Luo Tian through Xu Zhengwen, the benefits in the future would have been immeasurable.

Among the crowd, only Long Jie wore a look of regret. Regretting that Luo Tian had given the Nine-Revolution Flame Elixir to Du Hongtao. He'd wanted to taste it himself.

Luo Tian beat the two for a full hour, leaving people stunned. They watched his performance for an hour.

"Boom... boom..." Two battered figures were tossed before Jin Jingtian and Du Hongtao.

Luo Tian hadn't killed them. After all, he was still in the Mountain-Sea Pavilion. If he truly killed the disciples of two sects, he feared Du Hongtao and Jin Jingtian would break their pact.

But Luo Tian knew how to most effectively humiliate them. For such talents as Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu, it was tormenting their minds—more painful than physical harm.

Thus, for an hour, he had been striking their faces. Though his blows were heavy, he maintained control to keep them conscious. Thus, everyone below saw their expressions.

Feeling Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu had no life-threatening injuries, Du Hongtao and Jin Jingtian sighed in relief. They didn't know what to do if Luo Tian truly killed them before their eyes. After all, if Luo Tian's words were true, they would risk disaster for their sects.

As masters of the three great sects, they knew how terrifying Gu Tianshu had been. More so than rumors. After so many years, who knew what level this living fossil had reached? Even the heavens hadn't killed him—how extraordinary.

"Alright, everyone. I've vented my anger. I'll take my leave now! I'll visit Jinchuan Sect and Chongxiao Observatory later. Hope the two elders will welcome me!" Luo Tian smiled, addressing Jin Jingtian and the silent Lu Han Tian.

"Uh..." Du Hongtao and Jin Jingtian were stunned. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to leave so abruptly.
