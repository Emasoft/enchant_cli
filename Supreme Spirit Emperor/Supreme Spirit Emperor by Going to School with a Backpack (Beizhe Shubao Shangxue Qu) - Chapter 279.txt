Several martial arts techniques clashed in the sky, stirring boundless clouds and winds that coalesced into storm waves of the five elements, sweeping toward the surrounding barriers.

As these techniques collided, Luo Tian closed in with a thunderous roar, his golden fist swinging wildly toward Yin Yang's Holy Son.

Luo Tian's attack was terrifying; even Feng Jiutian, a prodigy at the peak of the Holy realm, could not withstand it. How much more so for Yin Yang's Holy Son?

"Crack..." In an instant, the fist imbued with terrifying power struck Yin Yang's Holy Son, and the sound of bones shattering echoed within the barrier. The fused pair spat blood and were hurled backward, separating gradually during their flight, eyes filled with terror.

"Terrible power! A peak Holy realm cultivator possesses such might—how did he achieve it?" People's faces bore expressions of shock, realizing Luo Tian's attack was unusually formidable. Even several domain lords felt a surge of crisis under his terrifying assault.

"Fan Tian's attack, breaking through all laws with one force, combined with understanding the three thousand great paths—such power is unsurprising!" Cao Yuanshan smiled slightly, speaking softly before turning his gaze to Sun Shengtian.

Yin Yang Sect and Ten Thousand Pavilion were pillars of the Demon-Fire Domain. If their sect elders and Holy Sons perished now, it would weaken the domain's strength. Cao Yuanshan did not believe Sun Shengtian could remain indifferent; these sects were direct descendants of the Divine Race, unlike Li Feichen's Thunder Domain.

After shattering Yin Yang's Holy Son, Luo Tian turned, like a god of war, charging toward the black-cloaked elder of Yin Yang Sect.

"Damn it!" The clan member targeted by Luo Tian turned pale, realizing instantly he was no match for Luo Tian.

"Block him!" Another white-cloaked elder, twin to the black-cloaked one, sensed his brother's peril and rushed to his side, striking a fist.

"No use!" Luo Tian scoffed, dismissing their combined attack entirely. Even a half-step纪元 (Epoch) cultivator would suffer if caught by Luo Tian, let alone these elders.

"Crack..." Thunder crackled as two more splintering sounds echoed, and the two elders of Yin Yang Sect met the same fate as their Holy Son. Their aged bodies were hurled backward, colliding with the barrier on the verge of disintegration.

"Crushing! Absolute crushing! A peak Holy realm cultivator caught in Luo Tian's grasp is absolute crushing!" People marveled, watching the golden-clad Luo Tian, exclaiming in awe.

"Still you!" Luo Tian refused to grant them respite, charging toward the elder of Ten Thousand Pavilion still stunned by his attack.

"Boom..." The thunderous sound echoed, and soon the elder of Ten Thousand Pavilion was also hurled back, joining the four elders in death.

The barrier reeked of blood and qi; five figures, faces ashen, gazed at Luo Tian. Now powerless to fight, they were like fish on a chopping block, eyes pleading for help toward Sun Shengtian.

"Die!" Luo Tian's eyes held no mercy, his figure flashing toward Yin Yang's Holy Son. His golden hand descended with terrifying power—should it land, the Holy Son would be dead for sure.

"Death!" All eyes turned to Sun Shengtian, knowing if he did not act, no one could save the four within the barrier.

Meanwhile, the several peak Holy realm cultivators who had previously attacked Long Jie secretly sighed with relief. They were glad they hadn't clashed with Luo Tian's group; otherwise, their fate would be worse than these Yin Yang Sect and Ten Thousand Pavilion figures. They doubted they could match the elders of Yin Yang Sect.

"Enough!" At last, under everyone's gaze, Sun Shengtian appeared within the barrier with a solemn face. His golden hand struck simultaneously against Luo Tian's.

"Boom..." Two golden hands, like two mountains of gold, collided, shaking the entire Holy Mountain. Even Cao Yuanshan's barrier, woven by several masters, trembled.

Luo Tian took a few steps back, his gaze turning serious as he addressed Sun Shengtian: "Divine King, what is your intent?"

People's faces shifted when they saw Luo Tian had only taken a few steps back. They hadn't expected Sun Shengtian's attack could be so easily deflected by Luo Tian. After all, Sun Shengtian was a Divine King of the Divine Race, a half-step Epoch cultivator. Though it was just a casual strike, even a peak Holy realm cultivator would not survive.

"Yin Yang Sect and Ten Thousand Pavilion are pillars of the Demon-Fire Domain, resisting the Shadow Domain. If they die now, it would hinder our resistance against the Shadow Domain. Thus, they must not perish!" Sun Shengtian smiled faintly, speaking with a solemn tone.

"Rubbish! Posturing so seriously!" Yan Xiuluo sat there, snorting. He despised Sun Shengtian's self-righteousness, knowing he was a hypocrite with ulterior motives.

The Chaos Domain Lord nodded in agreement; while the Chaos people were proud, they valued directness. If one had sufficient strength, they would earn their respect.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, locking eyes with Sun Shengtian. At this moment, he was within a hundred paces of Sun Shengtian—close enough for him to act in an instant. Luo Tian longed to test the gap between himself and Sun Shengtian, his heart stirring with eagerness.

"Don't attack! Sun Shengtian may have entered the Epoch's initial stage!" Just as Luo Tian's thoughts raced, Cao Yuanshan's voice echoed in his mind, subduing his urge to test.

"Epoch initial stage!" Luo Tian's heart jolted, gazing at Sun Shengtian whose smile remained. At this moment, Sun Shengtian was not attacking him to uphold his previous words of abandoning enmity. If Luo Tian attacked, it would give Sun Shengtian a reason to kill him.

Perhaps Sun Shengtian had been concealing his entry into the Epoch initial stage, waiting for Luo Tian's impulsiveness to eliminate him. After all, he was an old master who had lived countless years and was deeply scheming.

Though protected by Cao Yuanshan, if Luo Tian continued to attack, it might again escalate into a bloodbath like before. This time without Gu Tian's help or the Ancient Heaven Palace, if another revelation of the Divine Race's depth occurred, Luo Tian might not have a chance to escape.

"Ah, since the Divine King has spoken, I'll grant him this favor!" Luo Tian thought this through, a smile spreading across his face as he bowed to Sun Shengtian. He did not attack, standing there as if nothing had happened, releasing his aura.

Seeing Luo Tian hold back, Sun Shengtian nodded slightly, a flicker of disappointment in his eyes before he smiled: "Ah, I believe everyone witnessed Luo Tian's strength. There is no need for further proof. Now let us discuss the joint efforts of several domains!"

Hearing Sun Shengtian's words, Yan Xiuluo and Zhou Tianxing nodded. They waved their hands, dispersing the barrier. The scene returned to its previous state, but the Thunder Domain had no one to hold the line.

"Does your Thunder Domain have anyone who can represent it?" Sun Shengtian surveyed the Thunder Domain's people, finally setting his gaze on Li Tianzhi at the front.

Not only Sun Shengtian, but the Thunder Domain's people also focused on Li Tianzhi, a peak Holy realm cultivator. Now the Thunder Domain had become the weakest among the eight domains, lacking even a peak Holy realm cultivator. Li Tianzhi was the Thunder Domain's Holy Son, though some harbored resentment, his status remained undeniable.

"Respectfully, I am the Holy Son of the Thunder Domain. I dare to represent it in discussions with the elders!" Li Tianzhi's eyes gleamed with joy. Now, with a little maneuvering, he could control the entire Thunder Domain. After returning, eliminating all of Li Feichen and Li Cheng'en's lineage, he would become the true Thunder Domain Lord.

"Good!" Sun Shengtian said no more, now viewing the Thunder Domain with disdain. It was pitifully weak.

Luo Tian waved his hand, and a chair materialized in the sky. He surveyed the crowd of domain lords with a gaze before sitting down, joining several domain lords.

Li Tianzhi sat beside Luo Tian, representing the Thunder Domain at this joint assembly. However, he knew he was merely a token presence here, holding no real influence.

"Alright, everyone, let's now discuss how to counter the Shadow Domain's upheaval!" Seeing all had taken their seats, organizer Sun Shengtian spoke again.

Chapter 1172: War Begins ()

On the True Martial Continent, above the Supreme Lord, besides the Shadow Domain, eight domains' powerhouses gathered together. The entire Holy Mountain was packed with people; above the sky, domain lords of the eight domains continuously discussed how to counter the Shadow Domain's upheaval.

Yet, as these people debated how to resist the Shadow Domain, distant in the Shadow Domain, figures flickered. A host of gray silhouettes, eyes ablaze with fanaticism, continuously emerged outside the first major land of the Shadow Domain.

"Three million... thirty million..." A total of three million Shadow Domain warriors emerged, each radiating black qi. These were the accumulated forces of the entire Shadow Domain over the years—arrayed with terrifying might, capable of annihilating any star domain.

"Converging together to plan against us? How naive! Our Shadow Domain reigns over all, having already sacrificed the nine domains' living beings in ritual. This long-term accumulation cannot be stopped by them!" An elder at the Epoch's initial stage smiled faintly, murmuring.

"You've gathered together; that's perfect for us to attack!" The elder took action, followed by the nine Shadow Domain Holy Sons and peak Holy realm cultivators. With three million troops, they marched toward the entrance of the Four Sacred Star Domains.

"First attack the weakest three domains—Four Sacred Star, Fire Domain, and Thunder Domain—and then strike the others with one momentum!" The elder spoke, his voice filled with excitement as he led the Shadow Domain's forces to merge with those who had previously occupied the Four Sacred Star Domains.

Time passed slowly, three days vanished in an instant as Luo Tian and other domain lords continuously discussed strategies to resist the Shadow Domain's army.

Numerous commands were issued under their discussions, and the eight domains sprang into action accordingly.

"This is going to be exhausting!" Wan Lingkong was the first assigned a task, his mission being to collaborate with numerous array masters in constructing an immense transmission array. This would connect the entire eight domains, allowing other domains to respond swiftly if any domain was attacked.

The eight domains immediately became bustling with activity. Facing the Shadow Domain's crisis, no one dared to be lax; they all knew this was a matter of life and death. No sect would shirk their duty, for it was the plan decided by eight domain lords.

After seven days of discussions, the joint assembly on Holy Mountain concluded. Luo Tian, Cao Yuanshan, Yan Xiuluo, and others hurried to their respective star domains. This was because Zhou Tianxing of the Star-Weaving Domain had used celestial mechanisms to predict the Shadow Domain's upheaval would begin soon, though he hadn't calculated the exact time.

Beneath the starry sky of the Demon-Fire Domain, Cao Yuanshan and Luo Tian's forces flew swiftly, a sense of unease in their hearts. Especially after learning the Shadow Domain would attack soon, they were all tense. Even Zheng Xin, usually fond of mischief, was solemn, and the journey was silent without any playfulness.

Time passed slowly; three days vanished in an instant, and they finally reached the Beast Domain. Cao Yuanshan led Diao De and seven elders of the eight major Holy Cities toward the capital city, while Luo Tian's group headed again toward the Fire Domain.

As the Beast Domain people departed, only Luo Tian's close companions remained on the warship. Long Jie did not return to the Beast Domain, though his status was high there. Now, the Four Sacred Star Domains were Long Jie's home; Long Jian and his wife, along with the凶兽 (ferocious beasts) of Dian'an Forest, still resided at Tongtianshan in the Fire Domain.

"Luo Tian, we killed Feng Jiutian. If the Phoenix Clan's elder learns of it, he will surely not let this go. I fear the Phoenix Clan may turn against us!" Zheng Xin and others walked through the Beast Domain, recalling Feng Jiutian's death. Their eyes remained solemn.

Hearing their words, Long Jie was stunned. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to have killed Feng Jiutian. Previously, he had lived in the Beast Domain and knew Feng Jiutian's strength. Though he could suppress him, killing him was difficult. He also knew Feng Jiutian's status within the Phoenix Clan—this prodigy, destined to become a Epoch Master, was killed. That would be an eternal enmity.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, a serious expression on his face as he pondered how to deal with the Phoenix Clan's retaliation. Though the Divine Race had shown friendliness at the assembly, their hatred remained.

"Fight fire with fire! If they want to kill me Luo Tian, they must pay the price!" Luo Tian's eyes darkened, a cold glint in them. He was no longer an easy target.

As Luo Tian's group journeyed through the Beast Domain, a wail echoed from the Phoenix Clan's territory in the capital city. The sound was so loud it shook the entire city.

"Luo Tian, you've crushed my clan's hopes for ascension. No matter how the Shadow Domain's upheaval unfolds, I will destroy you!" The Phoenix Clan elder stood in his palace, shouting lowly. His eyes were blood-red, and a wild killing intent radiated from him.

"Grand Elder, please calm down. Now that Luo Tian's wings are fully grown, even a peak Holy realm cultivator like Jiutian couldn't match him. If we rashly attack, we might not be his match either!" A peak Holy realm elder's face showed reverence as he gazed at the Phoenix Clan elder.

"Yes, this kid is now a peak Holy realm cultivator. Even I can't match him. To kill him, we must summon the Phoenix Mirror and awaken our clan's depth. He must die; otherwise, it won't satisfy my clan's hatred!" The Phoenix Clan elder spoke coldly, determined to kill Luo Tian at any cost.

"Go! Hurry and summon the other clan elders, conceal it from Cao Yuanshan. If he finds out, he'll definitely stop us!" The Phoenix Clan elder ordered.

"Yes!" The Phoenix Clan's people showed madness in their eyes. Killing a prodigy like Feng Jiutian would drive any major clan into frenzy.

Not long after, several clan elders close to the Phoenix Clan arrived at their territory, faces showing sympathy. Feng Jiutian's death had spread throughout the Beast Domain; they had just returned to the capital city when they heard of it.

"Phoenix Elder, my condolences. Please let us know what you need!" The Peng Clan elder spoke, his eyes filled with hatred. The Phoenix and Peng Clans were closely allied, even to the point of intermarriage; they were one family.

"Yes! This Luo Tian was too arrogant, even daring to attack our eight major clan's Holy Sons!" Other elders also spoke indignantly. Not only Feng Jiutian had died at Luo Tian's hands.

"We'll conceal it from Cao Yuanshan, summon the Phoenix Mirror and intercept Luo Tian. If we can intercept him, he'll be safe from the Phoenix Mirror's power. You must protect your lives; take this opportunity to summon one of our clan's depth and destroy him completely!" The Phoenix Clan elder's face showed madness.

"Good!" They quickly discussed, and一道道 light emerged from their hands. The Phoenix Mirror, dormant beneath the capital city, began to tremble again, appearing in their palace. However, it was concealed by some means, unnoticed even by the Beast Domain's people.

"Go!" The clan elders carried the Phoenix Mirror and vanished silently from the palace.

"My clan's ancestors, my most outstanding descendant was killed. I beg our ancestors to rise and avenge us, proving our clan's might!" The Phoenix Clan elder cried out, his name echoing in a strange vibration into an ancient altar beneath the clan's territory.

In the貂 Clan (Mink Clan), Cao Yuanshan's face was dark, his gaze deep. He had also received the news of Feng Jiutian's death. Upon hearing it, he knew the Phoenix Clan would not hold back. If he were in their position, he'd be furious too.

As the clan elders set out, Cao Yuanshan sensed their fluctuations immediately. Though slight, they escaped his perception as he had been watching them closely.

"Ah! This kid is really a troublemaker!" Cao Yuanshan sighed deeply, his figure vanishing from his residence.

Luo Tian's group did not delay in the Beast Domain, flying at maximum speed. Soon they entered the Fire Domain.

After entering the Fire Domain, their hearts relaxed slightly; after all, it was a place they were familiar with. Their feelings differed.

Yet their hearts still felt heavy, worrying about home. They continued flying at high speed toward Tongtianshan.

Time passed slowly; as they were still a day's journey from Tongtianshan, they were stunned by the scene before them.

A massive array over a hundred miles in size appeared in their view, fully carved on an uninhabited star. Countless array flags filled the space.

"Transmission array built?" Luo Tian's eyes showed a hint of joy. Earlier, the domain lords had decided to construct transmission arrays first in the Fire and Thunder Domains, as these two were the weakest and likely targets for the Shadow Domain.

"Luo Tian? You're back?" On the star, Wan Lingkong with several domain array masters appeared in the星空 (starry sky), greeting Luo Tian's group.

"How do you like it? This super array can transmit a hundred thousand people at once!" Wan Lingkong's face showed pride. Building such an array would make any array master proud.

"Indeed! It's powerful!" Luo Tian nodded slightly, his gaze filled with awe.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian's group marveled at the array's power, the star's massive transmission array began to emit waves. Wan Lingkong's face changed.

"Why did someone activate it so soon after its completion?" Wan Lingkong's expression showed confusion, gazing at the array with suspicion.

Chapter 1173: Six Great Ancestors ()

In the Fire Domain, Luo Tian's group looked at the uninhabited star with confusion. They felt the complex transmission array on the star emitting waves, unable to fathom why it was activated so soon after construction.

"Beast Domain?" Wan Lingkong spoke softly, as the array's creator, he was most familiar with it. He sensed the fluctuation and knew which direction it came from.

"Beast Domain!" Hearing Wan Lingkong's words, Luo Tian's group furrowed their brows. Knowing now that someone from the Beast Domain had transmitted to the Fire Domain, it was certainly not good news.

"Prepare! Perhaps we'll have to fight!" Luo Tian spoke softly, waiting for the Beast Domain's people to emerge from the transmission array.

The buzz sound echoed as the massive transmission array activated, golden symbols carrying transmission power filling the starry sky. Under Luo Tian's group's watchful eyes, six aged figures appeared in their view.

"Indeed!" Luo Tian muttered as the figures emerged, his spear roaring and waiting for the Beast Domain's elders to step out of the transmission array.

"Luo Tian! You killed my Beast Domain's Holy City Holy Son! You're really bold!" The Dragon Clan elder spoke, his peak Holy realm aura radiating. Dragon qi surrounded him, and he scolded Luo Tian.

"Get out!" Before Luo Tian could speak, Long Jie's eyes showed contempt, standing beside Luo Tian. His aura凝聚 (concentrated), and he spoke.

Long Jie's current strength was peak Holy realm, nearing the peak with just a little more. Especially with the imperial aura he radiated, even against a peak Holy realm beast, Long Jie was fearless. Facing the Dragon Clan elder, he spoke confidently.

Zheng Xin, Gu Lei, Xu Liyi, Chen Zhanbiao, and others stood behind Luo Tian, their powerful aura forming a group. They gazed at the six peak Holy realm Beast Domain elders.

"Long Jie? You were once part of the Beast Domain, yet you shamelessly allied with Luo Tian to oppose us. What is your Beast Domain's Holy City to you?" The Golden-Winged Great Peng Clan elder spoke, his voice filled with accusation.

"What are you? Dare to speak to me like that!" Long Jie replied, his powerful bloodline aura making the six peak Holy realm elders frown.

"Dragon Clan's old man, it's still timely to regret. I once considered you a clan member. If you persist in your folly, when I reach peak Holy realm, I'll make you regret!" Long Jie's voice carried a powerful aura. His words echoed through the starry sky, confronting the Dragon Clan elder.

The Dragon Clan elder heard Long Jie's words and furrowed his brows, recalling Long Jie's terrifying strength. Feng Jiutian was extraordinary but still one level below Long Jie. In the same rank, Feng Jiutian would be suppressed by Long Jie. If Long Jie truly returned to the Dragon Clan, the clan's revival was imminent.

But now the Dragon Clan in the Beast Domain was weak; openly offending the Phoenix Clan would bring significant pressure.

"Long Elder! Think carefully—what's more important, a Dragon Clan prodigy or the harmony of the Holy City!" The Golden-Winged Great Peng Clan elder saw the Dragon Clan elder's hesitation and spoke softly, threatening him with the Holy City's harmony. Obviously, if the Dragon Clan elder stood with Long Jie, other clans would also turn against them.

The Dragon Clan had long held a high position in the Holy City, always second to the Phoenix Clan. Long Jie's strength was evident to all clans; they did not want the Dragon Clan to dominate the Beast Domain again, as that would leave them no chance for redemption.

"Long Jie, this is a test for you and your friends. If you survive this, you'll be the future Dragon Lord of the Dragon Clan—no one can replace you!" The Dragon Clan elder, hearing the Golden-Winged Great Peng Clan elder's words, had a cold glint in his eyes. If it weren't for the united clans, the Dragon Clan wouldn't be where they were now. In the past, the Dragon Clan ruled the entire Holy City, with all creatures submitting. The Dragon Clan's people wanted to revive their former glory. However, time passed, and the Dragon Clan declined. Except for the legendary Long Zhan Tian, no one could achieve it.

"Looks like you really want to fight us! Dragon Clan Lord, I don't care for your title. Luo Tian is my elder brother; if you attack him, I'll fight with you to the death!" Long Jie's eyes flashed coldly. The Dragon Emperor Seal radiated golden light, descending upon him.

"Kill!" Since they couldn't negotiate, only a battle remained. The six peak Holy realm elders were no match for Luo Tian's strength. He moved swiftly, charging toward the six elders with a cold killing intent. They wanted to kill him; he would not show mercy.

"Luo Tian, your strength is indeed formidable, but do you truly think no one can control you?" The Peng Clan elder saw Luo Tian near him, his eyes cold. His hands moved swiftly, light flashing, illuminating the starry sky.

"Buzz..." The buzz echoed as the six clan elders had prepared beforehand. They knew Luo Tian's strength was formidable; alone, no one could match him. Feng Jiutian's intention was to hold Luo Tian back, not kill him. So as soon as they started fighting, they activated the Epoch Treasure—Phoenix Mirror.

The ultimate power descended, and under the elders' control, a scorching light hovered above their heads. Divine light rained down, protecting the elders while a supreme light surged upward, striking Luo Tian with devastating force.

The buzz echoed again as the ultimate power descended. The powerful light, like a divine sword, severed the stars. Where it passed, stars were destroyed, turning into dust floating in the starry sky.

"Old fool!" Luo Tian's body halted mid-flight, gazing at the ultimate power light that swept toward him. His face darkened; he hadn't expected them to attack so ruthlessly, giving no chance for retaliation.

The six peak Holy realm elders could now unleash some of the Epoch Treasure's power, unlike Feng Jiutian who couldn't even activate it. They relied on the Phoenix Mirror's functions for combat.

The light pierced through the sky, sweeping toward Luo Tian in an instant, its destructive power making even him tremble.

"Roar..." The dragon roared; before Luo Tian could act, Long Jie activated the Dragon Emperor Seal, unleashing imperial dragon qi toward Luo Tian.

The imperial aura surrounded him, and the golden Dragon Emperor Seal pressed against the ultimate light, instantly blocking it.

"Boom..." The next moment, the pseudo-Epoch Treasure Dragon Emperor Seal flew like a meteor, colliding with the light. The seal was riddled with cracks; if not for the imperial dragon qi surrounding it, it would have turned to dust like those stars.

"Damn!" Long Jie's face paled slightly, cursing under his breath. He retrieved the Dragon Emperor Seal, knowing against an Epoch Treasure, a pseudo-Epoch Treasure was like a child—no chance of victory.

"What to do?" Long Jie spoke softly. If he could reach peak Holy realm, he might use the Beast Domain's secret methods to activate a fraction of the Phoenix Mirror and stop it. But now he was still peak Holy realm, and stopping that ultimate Epoch power was impossible.

"Ah, you think you've got me? If you want to play with Epoch Treasures and kill me, don't blame me for taking your Phoenix Mirror. I'll see where you cry when that happens!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed coldly, not hesitating. He directly summoned the Yin Fish, black light descending, and the demon sun rose, also containing Epoch power. He pressed it against the ultimate light.

"What is that?" Seeing Luo Tian summoning the Yin Fish, the Beast Domain elders' faces changed abruptly. They had left in a hurry and hadn't thoroughly questioned the Beast Domain people, unaware that Feng Jiutian had perished under Luo Tian's Yin Fish.

As people marveled at the ordinary turtle shell's immense Epoch power, black shells collided with the terrifying light.

To their amazement, no sound was heard. When the light met the shell, it seemed to encounter an endless black hole and was instantly devoured into the shell.

"Damn!" When the ultimate light entered the shell, the Yin Fish's spirit cursed loudly because the light had pushed several million miles and annihilated vast stretches of Epoch bones before stopping.

"Epoch Treasure, it's been a while since I've faced a true Epoch Treasure. It's quite exciting!" As the spirit, it could sense the light's Epoch power was a unique aura of an Epoch Treasure.

"What is that thing? It can even devour the Phoenix Mirror's attack!" The elders were completely stunned, not expecting any treasure to devour the Phoenix Mirror's attack. That was an attack capable of erasing even a peak Epoch cultivator!

"What else do you have? Hurry and use it!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed coldly, activating the shell to withstand the Phoenix Mirror's immense pressure. He flew forward, charging toward the elders beneath the Phoenix Mirror.

"Damn it! I don't believe the Beast Domain's Phoenix Mirror can't kill you!" Seeing Luo Tian charge, they changed faces. They remembered how Luo Tian had killed peak Holy realm cultivators on the True Martial Continent, and they activated the Phoenix Mirror again to strike Luo Tian.

"Hey, since you're not the true master of the Epoch Treasure, you haven't awakened the Phoenix Mirror's spirit. You still want to hurt me? You're really naive!" The Yin Fish's spirit echoed in Luo Tian's mind, calming his heart. He swung his spear, attacking the six elders.

Chapter 1174: Ultimate Power Collision ()

In the Fire Domain, under the starry sky, Luo Tian transformed into a divine warrior. The Yin Fish atop his head, depicting the Divine and Demon Dao Map, attacked the Beast Domain's elders. He faced the Epoch power of the Phoenix Mirror without fear.

"Kill him!" The Peng Clan elder's face darkened. They knew they couldn't let Luo Tian get close; although they were beasts with stronger bodies than humans, Luo Tian's terrifying attack had been witnessed before. A peak Holy realm cultivator could not withstand three punches from Luo Tian.

Plus, the crackling spear was now incredibly powerful, raising Luo Tian's attack to another level. Even a half-step Epoch cultivator would suffer if they underestimated him.

Flying, Luo Tian wielded his golden crackling spear, three thousand spears forming a storm of the three thousand great paths, sweeping toward the Phoenix Mirror.

"Buzz..." The buzz echoed as the Beast Domain's people didn't delay, immediately combining their power to activate the Phoenix Mirror and emit a light of Epoch power toward the terrifying spear technique.

"Boom..." The thunderous sound echoed as the Phoenix Mirror, an Epoch Treasure, could withstand Luo Tian's storm technique even with only part of its power.

However, although Luo Tian's spear technique was blocked, his figure appeared beneath the Phoenix Mirror, flying toward its protective barrier. His eyes held amusement.

"Come out!" Luo Tian shouted loudly, swinging his Dao Sealing Fist to strike the barrier imbued with Epoch power.

"Die!" Seeing Luo Tian's actions, the Beast Domain elders beneath the Phoenix Mirror wore a mocking expression.

What was the Phoenix Mirror? It was an Epoch Treasure crafted by the legendary Emperor of Beasts. If it could be easily broken by Luo Tian, it wouldn't deserve the title of Epoch Treasure.

Luo Tian's full-force fist struck the white barrier of the Phoenix Mirror, and a thunderous sound echoed. Next moment, Luo Tian's figure was hurled backward, his body emitting a thunderous sound, leaving him pale-faced.

"Timid turtle!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed coldly as he gazed at the Beast Domain elders, speaking softly.

The Beast Domain elders suffered no real harm but felt their minds thundering as if hearing countless thunderclaps, making them uncomfortable.

"Come out! You're not the elders of the Beast Domain? How could you be so weak, letting a junior approach your Epoch Treasure and not show yourself?" Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi cursed the Beast Domain elders who stood motionless beneath the Phoenix Mirror.

"You!" The Beast Domain elders' faces turned dark at Zheng Xin's curses, but they could do nothing. Luo Tian was watching them closely; if they stepped out, some would be killed by Luo Tian. They didn't want to see that, as their goal was only to delay Luo Tian.

"Think you can't handle me?" Luo Tian's eyes showed amusement, his hands forming golden symbols that merged into the black Yin Fish hovering above his head.

The buzz sound echoed again, and the black shell suddenly expanded, becoming a black demon sun radiating dark light. At the same time, heavy pressure spread from the shell.

The powerful pressure instantly rose around everyone, making Zheng Xin and others marvel before gazing at the Beast Domain elders hiding within the Phoenix Mirror.

The Beast Domain people's faces changed abruptly upon seeing the black demon sun in the starry sky. They could feel it, though not as powerful as the Phoenix Mirror, it contained immense power. Under the black demon sun's pressure, even a peak Epoch cultivator would suffer severe damage; a half-step Epoch would be crushed to dust.

"What is this thing? How did this kid obtain it!" The Beast Domain elders were completely panicked, their eyes filled with fear as they gazed at the Yin Fish, whose black qi surrounded it.

"Don't think about how this thing came to be. Now we must think about how to withstand this terrifying shell!" The Dragon Clan elder scolded, his eyes deep. Green holy power flowed from him, seemingly endless, pouring into the Phoenix Mirror.

The other elders also continuously poured holy power into the Phoenix Mirror. They knew Luo Tian's next attack would be apocalyptic; if they couldn't withstand it, they might be annihilated.

Luo Tian indeed did so; the black demon sun continuously drained Luo Tian's holy power, even with his holy power being several times more than ordinary. He felt strained.

"Using holy power to activate an Epoch Treasure is too consuming!" Luo Tian sighed in his heart, feeling his divine sea of holy power seemed to be drained.
