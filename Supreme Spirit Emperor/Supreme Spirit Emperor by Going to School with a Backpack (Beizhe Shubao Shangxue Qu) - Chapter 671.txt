The snake’s head writhed, its cold fangs emitting a sinister glow as it lunged at Luo Tian. The eagle’s head, its eyes cold and unyielding, unleashed bolts of lightning that struck at Luo Tian. From the fish’s head burst a towering column of water.

Each of these attacks could wound an Immortal King at the early stage, and even one at the middle stage would demand caution. Luo Tian moved like lightning, his feet pressing into the Yellow River Step, his bloodstained sword dancing in his grip. He engaged in another bloody battle. The crimson blade slashed repeatedly, its radiant edges cleaving through the forms of Hun and Ying. Yet their attacks also struck Luo Tian, forcing him to spit blood repeatedly.

Time passed slowly. After an hour, Luo Tian finally severed one of the snake’s heads at the cost of being struck by lightning. The Hun and Ying howled in pain, sensing Luo Tian’s formidable nature—just like the True Soul Beasts before. As the snake head fell, the city’s spiritual energy surged intensely, invigorating Luo Tian. He shook his body, expelling the thunderous power and charging forward again.

After an hour, the second city grew quiet. Luo Tian sat cross-legged once more, and the forms of Hun and Ying had vanished. A vast vortex hovered above his head, continuously channeling spiritual energy into him.

Boom... Boom... The thunderous sounds echoed within Luo Tian’s body. After two hours, he finally rose to his feet, eyes alight with fierce joy.

"I estimate I can break through to the sixth city and enter the middle stage of Immortal King!" Luo Tian stood, then strode toward the second city’s gate.

As soon as he left, the disciples of Fengdu Hall entered. Their eyes held confusion before turning to shock.

"If my guess is correct, the pattern at the gate must be Hun and Ying. How quickly he has slain it?" they gasped, though most of the spiritual energy had been absorbed by Luo Tian, leaving them with a still potent residue.

"We must hurry. If we fall behind and the third city’s ghosts regroup, it will be trouble!" They resumed absorbing the remaining spiritual energy.

Third city... Fourth city... Luo Tian endured bloody battles, slaying two ghostly beasts and passing through two cities. At last, he stood before the fifth city.

At this moment, Luo Tian’s aura was formidable. Though wounded, he felt himself on the brink of breakthrough—either fifth or sixth city.

A bird-like pattern appeared above the gate: a sharp beak, a body like a chicken, yet with a phoenix’s tail.

"Chongming!" Luo Tian narrowed his eyes, recognizing the entity within. His gaze held shock.

The Chongming Bird, a creature with twin eyes, resembled a chicken but possessed an exceptionally bright and melodious voice. It was one of the legendary beasts from the Primordial Era. That Avici Hell could manifest such a creature was beyond Luo Tian’s expectations, and he now understood why so many Fengdu Hall disciples had failed at the fifth city.

The Chongming Bird’s name was legendary, even dating back to ancient times when the true Chongming itself had been a powerhouse.

Yet Luo Tian knew this version was merely spiritual energy condensed, vastly different from the true Chongming Bird.

He stepped through the gate into the fifth city, his face grim. He was but a step away from the middle stage of Immortal King and could not waste this chance.

As he walked, a melodious cry echoed in his ears. The sound was unusually enchanting, as if imbued with magic, causing Luo Tian’s mind to waver slightly. Just that momentary lapse saw a mass of gray clouds appear above his head, and a cold glint descended toward his skull.

"Clash!" The crimson blade shot up instantly, sparks flying as Luo Tian’s cold sweat drenched his forehead. He cursed inwardly; if he had reacted a moment later, it would have been over.

Above his head stood a beak stretching ten feet long, clashing with the bloodstained sword. The massive body obscured the sky, its overwhelming pressure leaving Luo Tian no time to think of anything else.

"Whooosh..." Wind roared as the massive body soared into the sky, its wings flapping slowly. The cold gaze of the bird fixed on Luo Tian.

Another melodious cry, and Luo Tian’s lips curled. He quickly sealed his ears, but the sound still caused him to waver.

"Snarrr..." Pain jolted Luo Tian back to his senses. Two talons pierced his indomitable flesh but failed to penetrate.

Luo Tian felt himself lifted into the air, carried by the gray bird.

"Buzz..." A cold wind rose again above his head, and Luo Tian wore a bitter smile.

"Manifesting the Dao!" With a roar, Luo Tian activated his Manifesting the Dao. His shoulders were gripped by talons, leaving him powerless. The only thing he could do was shift the cold glint slightly.

Luo Tian’s body swelled rapidly, expanding to a hundred feet. The cold glint shifted slightly and struck his shoulder instead of his head.

Chapter 2512: The Sixth City

Within the gray city, a man and bird clashed repeatedly. This time, however, Luo Tian was at a disadvantage.

Blood gushed from his shoulder, creating a hole. This was the strength of Luo Tian’s flesh; an ordinary Immortal King at the early stage would have died instantly from this strike.

"Get down here!" Luo Tian roared, raising one hand with difficulty and reaching for the Chongming Bird. But as his body expanded, the bird could no longer grasp him and abandoned its pursuit, flying away instead.

"You bastard! If I saw your true form, I’d cook you!" Luo Tian cursed under his breath and took a bold step forward. Another melodious cry echoed, causing Luo Tian’s body to shudder slightly.

"Roar..." A gray domain expanded, and waves of spiritual energy howled within it, enveloping Luo Tian. He attempted to use the domain’s power to resist the piercing cries but found it ineffective.

"Damn!" Luo Tian cursed, and the Chongming Bird’s attack descended again.

Six bloodstains appeared on Luo Tian’s body, the wounds gushing blood like those carved by a blade.

"This isn’t working. His cry renders me immobile. I must find a way to solve this, or I’ll be at a severe disadvantage!" Luo Tian’s mind was anxious. He gazed at the Chongming Bird, now retreating to a distance.

As Luo Tian pondered, the bird cried out again, causing his lips to twitch.

Plop... Plop...

The cries continued, and the wounds on Luo Tian’s body multiplied. He relied solely on instinct to dodge fatal attacks.

Within half an hour, dozens of deep wounds covered his body. Each gaped open, blood flowing freely.

"Does my blood have no value?" Luo Tian cursed, his face pale. He could think of no way to resist the Chongming Bird’s cries.

"Chongming! Its eyes are twin pupils!" Luo Tian suddenly noticed the bird’s eyes, a hint of confusion in his mind.

"It resembles Mo Tian’s lunar eclipse eye!" Luo Tian mused, his hands moving swiftly as ten-colored flames enveloped him.

Crack... The gray domain could not withstand the Chongming Bird’s talons and was torn apart. The flames were pierced through, striking Luo Tian’s massive shoulder.

Boom...

Finally, Luo Tian could not endure. His colossal body shattered with a thunderous crash, and he stood on the ground in disarray.

"I see now. This sound is just a ruse! The Chongming Bird is using an illusion!" Luo Tian suddenly understood.

"In the midst of casting the illusion, it cries to mask it. It embeds the illusion within the sound, making those ensnared by the illusion mistakenly believe it is the sound that unsettles their minds!" Luo Tian whispered, his eyes alight with joy.

Close your eyes!

Luo Tian’s first reaction was to close his eyes, sealing his senses and attempting to resist the illusion. Yet another cry in his mind caused his lips to convulse violently.

"Nothing works! What else do you want from me!" Luo Tian cursed, opening his eyes to gaze at a wound on his arm.

"I can’t run anymore!" Luo Tian smiled bitterly. He had faced many illusions before, but this was the first time he felt utterly clueless. With a flash of Yellow River Step, he vanished from the spot.

No effect. No matter where Luo Tian fled within the city, he could still hear the Chongming Bird’s cries and was attacked immediately.

"Have the guts to fight a fair battle!" Luo Tian shouted, fleeing through the fifth city. He could not escape the bird’s attacks.

As Luo Tian was in disarray, the disciples of Fengdu Hall had finished absorbing the remaining spiritual energy from the fourth city and arrived at the fifth.

"The fifth city. His speed is too fast! He passed through the third and fourth cities in less than a day!"

"The fifth city. We can witness it now!" The disciples murmured, entering the fifth city.

As they entered, a melodious cry echoed in their ears. They were momentarily stunned and frozen.

"Chongming Bird, your grandfather!" A shout broke their trance. They saw Luo Tian being chased by the Chongming Bird.

"This... is too pitiful! Can’t even break through the fifth city?" They gazed at Luo Tian, now covered in blood, and chaos erupted.

"What kind of bird is that? I’ve never seen or heard of it!" They turned their eyes to the gray bird.

"It must be a rare one. Unfortunately, we won’t see what the sixth city looks like!" The disciples of Fengdu Hall discussed. Their bodies then straightened as they were overwhelmed by the magical sound.

"What should I do?" Luo Tian cursed inwardly, finding no solution. He felt he could not endure for long; within half an hour, he would surely be killed by the Chongming Bird.

"You’re forcing me!" Luo Tian cursed, unwilling to use it but having no choice now.

"Souls come! Join me in battle!" As he spoke, Luo Tian’s aura changed abruptly. His hands moved swiftly.

"Roar..." As Luo Tian growled, the countless spiritual souls drifting in the sky began to tremble. Waves of spiritual energy filled the sky, gathering toward Luo Tian.

With a roar, these souls tightly wrapped around Luo Tian. They coalesced and attached to his barrier.

The Chongming Bird cried, but this time, the multitude of souls blocked its cry. Luo Tian could no longer hear it. The bird’s gray eyes showed confusion, unable to see Luo Tian. It circled around his domain.

"Ah..." Luo Tian sighed deeply, finally able to recover. This was the last plan he had. If it failed, he would have no choice but to give up.

A wave of energy spread outward. Luo Tian now held a gray long sword, formed from spiritual soul power.

"One Strike to Heaven!" Cold words escaped Luo Tian’s lips. With a thunderous roar, the gray soul sword expanded dramatically, emitting an overwhelming aura. The surrounding souls immediately showed fear and parted to allow passage.

Luo Tian had no choice; he knew his attack was one shot. He must strike with all his might.

As the souls parted, the Chongming Bird cried out again. But it was too late. A sword of extinction shot forth, slicing toward the bird.

The world fell silent. The disciples of Fengdu Hall were stunned. When they recovered, they saw a devastating gray sword beam strike the Chongming Bird in midair.

Boom...

The bird cried out, its body exploding into a swirling mass of gray mist that drifted through the heavens.

"Damn it! Finally done!" Luo Tian panted heavily, collapsing to the ground. Without hesitation, he began absorbing the spiritual energy from the Chongming Bird.

Luo Tian knew this was a narrow victory. The countless souls had saved him; otherwise, he would have been unable to break the Chongming Bird’s technique.

"Struck... Struck!" One hundred disciples of Fengdu Hall stared in awe, watching Luo Tian sit cross-legged and covered in blood.

"The fifth city. Most of our elders and disciples have failed here. He passed through!" They erupted in chaos, eyes filled with disbelief.

Under their astonished gazes, Luo Tian absorbed the spiritual energy for an hour before rising slowly.

"Almost there!" Luo Tian’s aura surged. His eyes also held excitement; he could feel himself just a step away from the middle stage of Immortal King.

"The sixth city will definitely let me enter the middle stage of Immortal King!" Luo Tian whispered to himself, stepping out of the fifth city.

"Quickly absorb it. Let’s see what the sixth city is like!" The disciples of Fengdu Hall hurried to sit and absorb the remaining spiritual energy.

"The fifth city nearly cost me my life. How difficult will the sixth be?" Luo Tian mused, knowing he had an advantage here due to the souls.

"Advantage!" Luo Tian suddenly recalled a detail—the endless souls, though individually weak, formed a powerful tactic when combined.

"Perhaps by using these souls, I can have some chance of winning!" Luo Tian mused as he walked across the land without rushing to the sixth city, for his injuries were still fresh.

Time passed slowly. After half a day of walking, Luo Tian’s wounds finally healed. He reached the gate of the sixth city.

"What is this?" Luo Tian saw the image on the sixth city’s gate, his eyes narrowing slightly.

The sixth city's gate was not a beast but a human figure. It held a black long sword, wearing a black robe. Perhaps few could reach the sixth city, so the image was unusually clear.

"Who is this?" Luo Tian gazed at the lifelike image, feeling a sense of authority from it.

"Never mind. I’ll see for myself!" Luo Tian pushed the gate open and entered, observing the sixth city’s scene.

The entire sixth city was empty. Only a few hundred spiritual souls lay on the ground, unable to stand, their power weak.

Luo Tian walked slowly. In the gray mist, a figure stood proudly, radiating pressure and holding a long gray sword.

"Unexpectedly, someone has broken through the fifth city to reach me here!" The cold voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears.

"Respected elder, greetings!" Luo Tian bowed quickly. He knew the figure was definitely a powerhouse; even from a thousand feet away, he could not see its face.

Chapter 2513: Shentu

"Come, defeat me and you may proceed to the seventh city. There lies an opportunity beyond your imagination!" The gray figure spoke, its eyes also gray.

"Respected elder, I am but a humble disciple. I do not dare to challenge you!" Luo Tian spoke directly, complimenting the elder.

"Little one speaks well. But I won’t be swayed!"

"I am Shentu. Naturally, this is not my true form; I may have already died!" The gray figure chuckled.

"Damn it!" Hearing the phantom’s words, Luo Tian’s body trembled involuntarily, his mind cursing.

"No fight!" Luo Tian knew he couldn’t fight this phantom. Not only was its strength beyond his, but the name itself was legendary in ancient times.

Shentu, one of the creators of Avici Hell, the first headmaster of Fengdu Hall, an Emperor-level powerhouse known as the Fengdu Great Emperor. His name was renowned in ancient times.

Luo Tian had read about this history of Avici Hell in the Wheel Palace. It detailed the origin of hell and the names of its creators. How could he fight such a legendary figure? It was absurd.

"Who can pass through this sixth city?" Luo Tian mused, not rushing to fight but gazing at Shentu.

"Come on. The last one who passed through me was a long time ago, so long I’ve forgotten his name. He was called Ye Fengdu!" Shentu spoke, lifting his long sword.

"I won’t fight my nature!" Though Luo Tian knew he was no match, he did not give up. He still had the right to fight; after all, this Shentu was merely spiritual energy condensed and not even a residual soul.

"Boom..." The bloodstained sword appeared in Luo Tian’s hand. He stepped on the ground, leaping into the air and rushing toward Shentu.

Like lightning, Luo Tian instantly appeared before Shentu. The crimson sword slashed downward, cutting through the dim sky and hovering over Shentu’s head.

Shentu remained calm. He raised his gray long sword and blocked Luo Tian’s bloodstained blade.

Crack... Thunderous sound echoed. The crimson sword collided with the gray one, and Luo Tian felt a powerful rebound force on his body. His arm went numb, nearly losing the sword.

Luo Tian was thrown back but did not despair. He stepped on the ground again, rushing toward Shentu who remained still.

Seven punches converged, a flurry of blows that shattered the void and struck Shentu’s head.

Shentu’s gray face always wore a smile. He let Luo Tian’s punches hit him and then swung his long sword toward Luo Tian.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed, seeing the overwhelming power of the sword beam. He knew if his punches hit Shentu, he wouldn’t know what would happen. But one thing was certain: Luo Tian would be split in two by Shentu’s sword.

In an instant, Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with determination. He extended his other hand and sent out an invisible wave, grabbing the gray sword beam.

"Boom..." Seven punches converged, striking Shentu’s body and causing his face to show surprise.

"Pu..." The gray sword simultaneously cut into Luo Tian’s left hand, penetrating half an inch. Blood flowed down his palm.

Shentu took two steps back, and the sword was pulled out of Luo Tian’s hand, still stained with his blood.

"Too strong. The Eight Directions Falling Treasure technique could not change the sword’s trajectory. This is the first time in years!" Luo Tian was shocked, gazing at Shentu standing there.

"Manifesting the Dao!" Luo Tian roared and his body expanded dramatically. He took a powerful step, charging toward Shentu.

Boom... Boom...

But Shentu slashed seven times in succession, violently breaking through the Seven Steps of蛮. The seventh strike shattered Luo Tian’s manifested body.

"Cough... Cough..."

"Is this even human!" Luo Tian coughed blood, his body falling to the ground in disarray. He gazed at Shentu still standing there.

"You’re strong, but to defeat me, you need some time. The Immortal King stage is one step higher than the heavens. My strength is comparable to the middle stage of Immortal King, but it’s still too far. And you’re not in full condition!" Shentu spoke softly.

"I won’t believe it!" Luo Tian gathered his soul sword again. A wild aura radiated from the gray soul sword, the one he had used to defeat enemies repeatedly.

"This is interesting!" Shentu’s gray eyes narrowed slightly, finally showing interest. He gazed at the gray long sword in Luo Tian’s hand, which also radiated an overwhelming aura.

"One Strike to Heaven!"

"Blade of the Yellow River!" Luo Tian and Shentu spoke simultaneously. Two overwhelming sword beams shot from their hands.

Crash...

The two sword beams collided above their heads. The humming sound continued, and the beams kept eroding each other for a hundred breaths. Luo Tian’s face turned pale instantly.

The one-sided "One Strike to Heaven" was shattered by Shentu’s sword beam and continued to strike Luo Tian.

"Pu..." In an instant, a wound appeared on Luo Tian’s chest. His body was thrown back with a thunderous crash, his ribs severed by the sword beam.

Boom...

Luo Tian fell to the ground again. His eyes held disbelief. This was his strongest strike, yet it still failed against Shentu.

"I only remember two martial arts. This is one of them!" Shentu spoke, his voice filled with admiration.

"So变态! Even ancient emperors are this变态? He’s even a residual soul of an emperor!"

"If he were alive, who in the entire celestial realm and hell could withstand his gaze alone!" Luo Tian was shocked to the core.

"You’ve forced me to use my martial art. You’re quite good, similar to Ye Fengdu!" Shentu spoke, lifting his long sword again, which emitted a series of resonant sounds.

"Master of Fengdu Hall, you only forced Shentu to use his martial art. How did he pass through?" Luo Tian’s eyes sparkled, catching the flaw in Shentu’s words.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian pondered, a gray sword beam slowly gathered, bringing him back to his senses.

"Soul come!" Luo Tian shouted loudly. He knew his current state could not withstand Shentu, so he relied on the souls.

Soul cries echoed. Countless souls swept across the heavens, rushing toward Luo Tian and enveloping him.

"Hmm?" Shentu’s expression finally changed. He gazed at the gray souls surrounding Luo Tian, his eyes showing surprise. His sword beam gradually calmed.

"Stop!" Luo Tian stood among the souls, instantly feeling Shentu’s sword beam had calmed. His eyes showed joy.

"He dares not attack these souls? Impossible!" Luo Tian was puzzled. With Shentu’s current strength, he could easily destroy these souls to attack him.

"Little one, come out!" Shentu spoke, standing a hundred feet away. His brows furrowed. The rules prevented him from harming the souls.

"I won’t come out. If I do, you’ll kill me!" Luo Tian smiled, looking like he was staying put.

He could feel Shentu seemed very wary of him now. Luo Tian would not miss this opportunity.

"Little one, are you not a man? A real man would come out and fight!" Shentu shouted loudly, the scene similar to when Luo Tian faced Chongming Bird in the fifth city. This time, however, it was Shentu shouting.

"How can this be fair? You’re at the middle stage of Immortal King, and I’m only at the early stage. This isn’t fair!" Luo Tian cursed, his voice filled with disdain.

"You’re being a cheat! Do you know that!" Shentu roared, recalling how Ye Fengdu had passed through using a similar trick.

"Then let me pass. I won’t be a cheat!" Luo Tian took a step forward toward the exit of the sixth city, his face showing a smile.

"You bastard!" Shentu watched Luo Tian move to the gate. He saw Luo Tian surrounded by countless souls approaching the gate.

"Come and fight me, elder! I’m out!" Luo Tian said in a provocative manner. Though he wanted to destroy Shentu and absorb him, he knew it was impossible with his current strength. He only wanted to see what awaited in the seventh city, to gain some experience.

"You..." Shentu didn’t know how to respond. He watched the gate slowly open, a crack forming.

"One chance. That is when he exits the city, there will be an opening!" Shentu whispered lowly. His gray long sword radiated an overwhelming aura.

"Go!" Luo Tian cautiously opened the gate, waiting until it was wide enough for one person to pass. He then flashed out toward the exit.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian exited the gate, a sense of crisis filled his mind. His face turned grim.

A gray sword beam annihilated the void, appearing behind him and giving Luo Tian a life-threatening sense.

"Block it for me!" Luo Tian roared, rushing out of the gate. He suddenly turned around and spread his Eight Directions Falling Treasure technique to block Shentu’s final sword beam.

"Little one, it's your luck! If you survive this strike, I’ll let you pass!" Shentu’s voice echoed in the city. The gate slowly closed.

"Pu..." Blood spewed out, and Luo Tian’s entire right arm was severed by the gray sword beam. His face turned pale.

"One arm is nothing. I can afford it!" Luo Tian panted heavily, laughing as he looked at the slowly closing gate. His eyes were heavy, and his body fell to the ground.

Chapter 2514: The Call at the End of Reincarnation

"The sixth city! We’ve reached the sixth city!" One hundred disciples of Fengdu Hall wore joy on their faces as they entered the sixth city, gazing at its empty expanse.

After passing through the first five cities, these one hundred disciples had significantly improved their strength. Two of them were at the threshold of Immortal King, and most had climbed a small step.

"Where is Luo Tian? There was a battle’s fluctuation, but we didn’t see him. Did the battle end? Did he succeed or fail?" They murmured, moving toward the city’s center.

After a while, they saw Shentu standing at the center. Their eyes widened in shock.

"This is our ancestor!" They gasped, having all been taught to worship Shentu’s statue before entering Fengdu Hall. They knew him well.

"Respect our ancestor!" They immediately knelt, faces filled with reverence as they gazed at Shentu standing there.

Shentu’s mood was clearly bad. He could feel his strike had not killed Luo Tian, though this was not the true Shentu. It still bore his features. For Shentu, it was an indescribable humiliation.

"Defeat me and you may pass through the sixth city!" Shentu spoke, his voice cold.

"What...?" Hearing Shentu’s words, the disciples of Fengdu Hall erupted in chaos. They hadn’t expected the sixth city to be so difficult.

"Disciples dare not!" They knew that even if they combined their strength, it would still be no match for Shentu. Thus, they didn’t dare to resist.

"Perhaps Luo Tian left before the battle ended. This city is too difficult!" The disciples of Fengdu Hall thought inwardly, but they felt it was worth it to see Shentu. After all, they had passed through the fifth city.

"Sorry!" Shentu spoke and swung his long sword. A gray sword beam directly struck the one hundred disciples.

Boom... Boom...

The sword beam swept across, and each disciple’s eyes showed shock. Blood mist rose as the one hundred disciples, including those at the threshold of Immortal King, could not withstand the beam. They were instantly cut down.

Buzz...

Outside the hall, the one hundred disciples suddenly appeared on Fengdu Hall’s mountain peak. Their faces still showed fear.

"They’ve come out!" Ye Fengdu and others smiled as they watched the disciples emerge. However, they didn’t see Luo Tian’s presence.

"They’ve come out together. That kid must still be struggling!" A senior with Immortal King late stage spoke.

"Only three days, and he couldn’t endure. He must be stuck in the fifth city!" Many had entered Avici Hell before and knew its nature.

"Indeed, the Chongming Bird’s power is strong. The most terrifying part is its illusion, almost impossible to counter!" They sighed.

"What’s going on inside?" Ye Fengdu asked the disciples, as they were the ones who knew.

The one hundred disciples heard Ye Fengdu’s question and regained their senses. They looked at Ye Fengdu and others, then one of them gasped: "Luo Tian didn’t come out!"

"My god!" The one hundred disciples inhaled sharply. They clearly remembered that they hadn’t seen Luo Tian’s figure in the sixth city.

"Ah?" Hearing their gasps, Ye Fengdu furrowed his brows. He felt something was wrong.

"Report to the Grandmaster, Luo Tian passed through the fifth city. We didn’t find his figure in the sixth city and were immediately cut out by Master Shentu!" They looked puzzled, their faces confused as they gazed at Ye Fengdu.

According to the rules, only those who defeated the city’s guardian could proceed. Since Shentu was still present in the sixth city, Luo Tian hadn’t technically passed it.

"What? Luo Tian has passed through the fifth city!" Hearing the disciples’ report, everyone’s faces showed disbelief.

"And he may have already passed through the sixth city!" Ye Fengdu spoke, recalling how he had passed through the sixth city without defeating Shentu.

Ye Fengdu’s words fell silent, and the hall outside became quiet. The people looked at each other in confusion. This was the first time they had heard of anyone passing through the sixth city besides Ye Fengdu.

"Wait, and when he comes out, it will all be clear!" Ye Fengdu spoke softly without surprise.

"Grandmaster doesn’t care? I heard the seventh city contains a great opportunity. It’s one of those rare chances!" Many elders and disciples looked at Ye Fengdu with surprise.

...

At this moment, Luo Tian was lying on the ground with his eyes closed, his body dazed. His severed right arm slowly grew back.

"You’ve finally come... I’ve waited for you a long time!" A soft whisper echoed in Luo Tian’s mind amidst the chaos.

"Once you become strong, remember to save me..." The whisper repeated. Luo Tian was dazed, his body radiating golden light.

After half a day, Luo Tian finally sat up. He gazed at his newly grown arm with confusion.

"I must have had a dream!" Luo Tian whispered, but he couldn’t recall what the dream was. His brows furrowed.

"Save you!" Luo Tian thought for a while, only recalling those two words. His mind was more confused.

"Save who? How to save?" Luo Tian slowly stood up and walked toward the distant city.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian had no idea how long he had been here, as he didn’t know how long he had been unconscious.

After half an hour of walking, Luo Tian finally reached the city gate. His eyes held anticipation. He knew he was no match for the people inside this city, but he just wanted to see it.

The gate had nothing but emptiness. Luo Tian pushed the door open and stepped in. As he entered, he was stunned.

Before his eyes were six massive channels. Spiritual souls were absorbed by the six channels.

"Human Path, Demon Path, Animal Path, Hell Path, Ghost Path, and Outer Path!" Luo Tian gazed at the six massive channels. His eyes showed shock.

"This can’t be... the Six Paths of Reincarnation!" Luo Tian spoke aloud, overwhelmed by the sight.

"Ye Fengdu had also come here. The Six Paths of Reincarnation Sword might have been领悟 from this place and then passed to Ye Qiu!" Luo Tian understood.

"This is the power of the Six Paths of Reincarnation. If I can comprehend it, my strength will surely increase!"

"And this place has the most concentrated spiritual energy. If I have enough time, I will definitely reach the middle stage of Immortal King!" Luo Tian’s eyes showed joy. He immediately sat cross-legged on the ground, beginning to cultivate and comprehend the terrifying Six Paths of Reincarnation power.

"Reincarnation... what is reincarnation!" Luo Tian’s mind was confused. He felt this reincarnation power seemed not to belong to this world, giving him a sense of reverence.

"Reincarnation Body... my Reincarnation Body... what connection does it have with this reincarnation power!" Luo Tian’s vast spiritual awareness spread out, instantly plunging into the six massive channels.

In an instant, Luo Tian’s mind was shocked. His thoughts were flooded with many images, as if he had transformed into all things in the world.

Luo Tian felt his soul was divided into countless parts, reborn and transformed into all things in the world—humans, plants, fierce beasts.

"Vast and boundless heaven and earth!" This was the only feeling Luo Tian had. The entire world was simply too vast.

Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes. In an instant, he felt a profound understanding. It was as if he had passed through countless years. This feeling was strange for Luo Tian.

"Reincarnation power!"

"Heaven and earth cycle, the Six Paths of Reincarnation!" Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with intense light. His mind seemed to understand much.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian pondered, waves of energy acted upon his body. His face slightly changed.
