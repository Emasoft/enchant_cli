"Ugh..." Ding Pengzu was momentarily stunned, looking at Du Yuying who seemed somewhat defiant. He couldn't seem to get angry at her.

Seeing Ding Pengzu staring blankly, Du Yuying furrowed her brow and lifted her jade-like foot, kicking Ding Pengzu down from the platform.

"Let's start!" After doing this, Du Yuying wore a determined expression on her face and addressed Du Hongtao who was sitting there.

"Ah... let's start!" Du Hongtao sighed helplessly and announced the beginning of the Dan competition.

As soon as Du Hongtao's words had barely faded, a number of disciples from the Shanhai Sect appeared before those participating in the Dan competition with expressions of respect, handing out the Dan formulas and spiritual herbs to everyone.

"Supreme-grade elixir!" Lu Tian's eyebrows slightly furrowed as he looked at the three Dan formulas in the jade slip. One was an Imperial-grade elixir, another was a beginning-level Supreme-grade formula, and the third was an advanced-level Supreme-grade formula.

Chapter 889: Nine Turn Flame Elixir

On the square of the Shanhai Sect, everyone's faces were filled with joy as they looked at the three elixir formulas. They couldn't help but feel excited.

Supreme-grade elixir formulas were rare even in the Fire Region, where Dan cultivation was prevalent. Especially since one of these three formulas was a middle-level Supreme-grade formula, which was truly precious. It could be said that even if the one thousand people failed to produce an elixir, just obtaining this Supreme-grade formula would be enough to cover their costs.

Lu Tian's face remained calm and expressionless. It wasn't that he didn't like Supreme-grade elixir formulas; if it had been before meeting Gu Tianshu, Lu Tian would have laughed for a long time upon encountering an initial-level Supreme-grade formula. However, after meeting Gu Tianshu, the former regional master of the Fire Region and the first Supreme-grade alchemist in the Fire Region, he had little regard for middle-level Supreme-grade formulas.

With Gu Tianshu's inheritance, Lu Tian now had hundreds of Supreme-grade elixir formulas in his mind. This initial-level Supreme-grade formula was already present within Gu Tianshu's inheritance, but the middle-level one wasn't. This intrigued Lu Tian.

"Ha! A bumpkin, you've never seen a Supreme-grade elixir formula before, have you? I advise you to just stick with the Imperial-grade elixir and don't disgrace the spiritual herbs for the Shanhai Sect!" Ma Tianyang sneered at Lu Tian, who was standing there in a daze.

Faced with Ma Tianyang's mockery, Lu Tian ignored him. He had met too many self-important prodigies like this.

"Nine Turn Flame Elixir!" Lu Tian whispered to himself, trying to figure out why the Shanhai Sect's test would use this elixir.

"Maybe it was just randomly chosen," Lu Tian sighed inwardly.

As he sighed, someone had already ignited flames and started to refine the elixir. Instantly, the temperature of the entire Shanhai Sect quietly rose.

Lu Tian habitually sat cross-legged and adjusted his state. He had previously refined a Supreme-grade initial-level elixir in the Tongtian Sect, but the success rate was extremely low due to the short time.

Now that the Shanhai Sect had presented a middle-level Supreme-grade elixir, it was clearly believed that someone among these people could have the strength to refine a Supreme-grade elixir. If Lu Tian wanted to win, he had to refine a middle-level Supreme-grade one to increase his chances. As for how the winner would be judged, that was not something Lu Tian could consider. His goal was the Book of Epochs; even if he failed in the competition, he would take the fragment of the Book of Epochs by force, even if it meant being pursued by the three great sects.

Time slowly passed. Lu Tian sat cross-legged for an hour, finally adjusting his state to its peak before standing up and scanning around. He noticed that many people had already entered the stage of refining the medicinal liquid.

"Indeed, it's no wonder that the Fire Region is known for Dan cultivation. These one thousand alchemists would surely cause a stir in the Four Holy Star Regions!" Lu Tian said with a hint of admiration, his gaze finally settling on Lu Tianyu and Ma Tianyang, the three great sects' princes.

"Supreme-grade Sacred Vessel!" Lu Tian's eyebrows slightly furrowed as he looked at the large cauldrons before them, clearly of a higher grade. He was once again impressed by the depth of the three great sects, who even had a Supreme-grade sacred vessel.

With a wave of his hand, the Zhenhun Cauldron appeared before Lu Tian. A heavy atmosphere radiated from it.

"Let's try, do our best!" Lu Tian moved his hands slightly, and a series of residual images appeared before him. His expression also became serious.

"This kid is actually quite good, his movements are steady and it's clear he isn't just an ordinary method!" Lu Han Tian looked at Lu Tian with a hint of surprise.

"He does have some talent, but without a Supreme-grade sacred vessel, I think this kid can only refine an initial-level Supreme-grade elixir. It's difficult to refine a middle-level one!" Jin Chan Sect Master Jin Jingtian shook his head lightly.

Thunderous sounds erupted as Lu Tian placed each spiritual herb into the Zhenhun Cauldron. At the same time, thunderous sounds echoed around him as young disciples looked at their cauldrons with disappointment.

"Failed... Ah..." A series of sighs echoed from the platform.

Although these people were skilled in Dan cultivation, they still had a significant gap when it came to refining middle-level Supreme-grade elixirs. They were only trying because the herbs and formulas were already available, and it would be a pity not to try.

"Maybe I should refine an Imperial-grade elixir instead!" Some people had given up on refining Supreme-grade elixirs and switched to Imperial-grade ones.

Of course, some people didn't give up, confident in themselves. They turned to the initial-level Supreme-grade formula.

A few people hadn't exploded their cauldrons, still looking serious. Their cauldrons were the ones of Lu Tianyu and Ma Tianyang, as well as several other prodigies from sects with strength comparable to the Tongtian Sect, and Lu Tian himself made up nine people.

However, Lu Tian was naturally excluded from the group because he was still continuously throwing herbs into his cauldron at a slower pace. The other people's cauldrons had already begun to emit faint fragrances.

"Boom..." But it was indeed difficult to refine a Supreme-grade elixir. Soon after, one of the young disciples' cauldrons emitted thunderous sounds, obviously exploding.

It seemed like a chain reaction. After that disciple's cauldron exploded, the nine people who were still persisting also began to emit thunderous sounds one after another. The cauldrons emitted thick smoke, and the medicinal liquid inside turned to ashes.

"Ah... failed! A middle-level Supreme-grade elixir is indeed difficult!" Lu Tianyu smiled indifferently. He had come here just to have fun. If it hadn't been for Du Yuying's persistent enticement, he wouldn't have participated in this competition.

"Hmph! What kind of elixir is so difficult!" Du Yuying pouted slightly, looking at Du Hongtao who was sitting high up with a hint of resentment.

"Cut it out! This kid is just starting to refine the medicinal liquid. He's doing it on purpose, trying to draw attention, right?" Ma Tianyang looked at Lu Tian who had just entered the stage of refining medicinal liquid and sneered again.

"Ha! I'll add some ingredients to him. It's better if he doesn't act like he's on par with us. He really thinks he's someone special!" Jin Tianlu smiled, looking at Lu Tian and sending out a massive spiritual awareness into his Zhenhun Cauldron.

At that moment, Lu Tian was carefully refining each spiritual herb. The herbs needed for a middle-level Supreme-grade elixir were numerous, and even Lu Tian was careful.

However, as Jin Tianlu's spiritual awareness entered the Zhenhun Cauldron, Lu Tian suddenly froze and quickly sent out a thread of spiritual awareness to block Jin Tianlu's spiritual awareness.

Although he blocked Jin Tianlu's spiritual awareness, due to his distraction, the Zhenhun Cauldron also emitted a thunderous sound. Thick black smoke emerged from the lid of the cauldron.

"Die!" Lu Tian's eyes flashed with killing intent. He looked at Jin Tianlu and clearly, Jin Tianlu's actions had completely ignited Lu Tian's desire to kill.

That was Lu Tian. If it were another alchemist, they would have been injured in the spiritual sea by Jin Tianlu's spiritual attack without warning.

Thinking of this, Lu Tian released a massive spiritual awareness that formed an invisible storm and rushed toward Jin Tianlu. Obviously, he didn't want to let Jin Tianlu escape.

"Hmph..." Just as Lu Tian's spiritual awareness was about to touch Jin Tianlu, a cold sound echoed in Lu Tian's ears. His face turned pale immediately. He looked up and saw Jin Jingtian's eyes gradually turning cold.

"Everyone, don't deliberately interfere with others' elixir refining. If you do so, I will cancel their qualifications and expel them from the Shanhai Sect!" Du Hongtao's voice carried a hint of authority as it echoed in everyone's ears.

But Lu Tian seemed to have not heard Du Hongtao's words. His eyes met Jin Jingtian's golden eyes, but eventually he withdrew his powerful spiritual awareness and took a long breath.

"Another frustrating feeling! My strength is still not enough!" Lu Tian sighed inwardly and closed his eyes again to adjust his state.

"Ha! Kid, just stick with refining that Imperial-grade elixir. Maybe you can save your life!" Ma Tianyang sneered at Lu Tian with a cold smile.

"Go to hell..." Lu Tian responded coldly, clearly angry at the provocation.

No one knew what had happened to these people. No one understood why Du Hongtao said that, but no one dared to ask and continued refining their elixirs.

Lu Tianyu still wore a calm smile on his face, gently patting the sacred vessel before him. Du Yuying's small face was filled with confusion as she looked at Lu Tian, wondering why Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu were targeting this young man named Lu Tian.

Du Yuying, the beloved of the Shanhai Sect, was somewhat naive but not foolish. Suddenly she remembered the rumors about Tongtian Sect's Ma Tongsun being killed by a young man. She figured out the reason and became even more interested in Lu Tian.

After this small incident, the platform once again emitted a terrifying temperature. People started another round of elixir refining.

Lu Tian slowly opened his eyes, returning to his previous state. He looked at Jin Tianlu and Ma Tianyang with a slight smile on his lips: "Since you want to play, today I'll play with you!"

Lu Tian slapped the Zhenhun Cauldron and his hands once again formed a series of residual images. His eyes were closed, entering the state of unity with heaven and man. A spiritual herb was sequentially placed into the Zhenhun Cauldron by Lu Tian.

"Faster! Entering the state of unity with heaven and man to refine elixirs. This kid really thought of it!" Lu Han Tian exclaimed, watching Lu Tian with his eyes closed. He hadn't expected Lu Tian to come up with such a method.

Chapter 890: The Method of Completing the Elixir

On the platform of the Shanhai Sect, a thousand young prodigies from various sects in the Fire Region wore expressions of concentration as they looked at their cauldrons. The rich aroma of herbs spread throughout the Shanhai Sect, entering the noses of everyone below the platform and making people look enchanted.

"Little brother, do you think Lu Tian can win?" Xu Zhengwen looked at Lu Tian with admiration and spoke respectfully to Long Jie.

"I don't know. However, I have confidence in my brother. Whether it's elixir refining or fighting, he has never let anyone down!" Long Jie smiled, thinking back to the first time he met Lu Tian. It was because of an elixir that he had developed a slight liking for Lu Tian, leading to the events that followed.

"..." Xu Zhengwen was speechless at Long Jie's confidence. This young man really thought that the prodigies and princesses of the three great sects were given for free.

Everyone held their breath, watching the people on the platform waiting for the moment when they would complete their elixirs. A thousand or more Imperial-grade alchemists completing their elixirs at the same time would be an impressive scene.

"Boom... Boom..." A deep thunderous sound echoed, drawing people's attention to the source of the noise.

Indeed, a disciple from an unknown sect had his elixir overflowing with spiritual energy. The sky above was filled with thunder, and lightning struck the cauldron before the young man.

As the young man's cauldron emitted a sound, it seemed to have ignited a fuse. Immediately, the entire platform roared with thunderous sounds. However, it was no longer an explosion but a true completion of the elixir. The sky above the Shanhai Sect suddenly darkened, thick clouds blocking all light and making it seem like night. Colorful lightning fell from the sky towards each elixir that flew out of the cauldrons.

Numerous golden elixirs soared into the sky, clashing with the lightning. People were stunned by this magnificent scene. Even Du Hongtao, Jin Jingtian, and Lu Han Tian of the three great sects had their eyes shining with admiration.

"How long has it been since we've seen such a scene?" Du Hongtao looked at the platform of the Shanhai Sect, which seemed to have become a sea of thunder.

"Yes, it's been a long time since the Fire Region has held such an elixir competition!" Jin Jingtian's face also showed a sense of nostalgia.

The thunderous sound lasted for an hour. The square finally regained some calmness. A total of eight hundred and fifty people chose to refine Imperial-grade elixirs, but not all of them successfully completed the elixirs. However, nearly six hundred people managed to refine Imperial-grade elixirs with an extremely high success rate.

The clouds in the sky grew thicker and heavier, as if they knew there were still people to complete their elixirs. They didn't leave but instead brought a more terrifying pressure, creating an oppressive atmosphere in people's hearts.

"This pressure... there must be a Supreme-grade elixir about to emerge!" Du Hongtao and the other two looked surprised, their eyes fixed on the more than one hundred people still refining their elixirs.

Light and color spread everywhere. Among the remaining more than one hundred people, as people watched with anticipation, light and color spread from their cauldrons. A sound of waves echoed, shaking people's hearts.

"Supreme-grade elixir!" Someone shouted excitedly. The emergence of a Supreme-grade elixir was more dramatic than the previous Imperial-grade ones, and the entire platform shook with a series of thunderous sounds.

"Buzz..." Finally, one disciple's cauldron lid lifted. A streak of golden light slowly emerged from the elixir cauldron, like a rising sun.

At the same time, other disciples' cauldrons were also influenced and emitted golden light, lighting up the entire sky.

However, in an instant, thick clouds released a pressure. A massive hand that seemed to cover the sky gradually formed within the clouds, spreading an oppressive atmosphere throughout the world. It felt as if it could suppress everything.

"This hand is truly terrifying. Why do I feel that there's no ability to resist under this hand!" People felt the terror of the golden hand and spoke in a trembling voice.

"This is the only trial for refining a Supreme-grade elixir. The Supreme-grade level is completely unacceptable to heaven and earth. Any Supreme-grade treasure that emerges will face the suppression of heavenly forces!" Du Hongtao and the other two looked solemn. Even with their initial-level saintly cultivation, they had to be careful against this heavenly hand.

"Boom..." At the moment the golden hand was formed, someone's elixir could not withstand it and was crushed by the terrifying pressure.

Those who had refined Supreme-grade elixirs looked shocked, their faces filled with despair. They gazed at the golden hand in the sky without any will to resist.

"Boom... Boom..." It was as if fireworks were being set off in the sky. The golden hand fell heavily, and those elixirs that looked like the sun were all annihilated. A storm swept across the platform.

"Failed!" The faces of those alchemists showed despair, their pale faces and blood spitting indicated they had suffered a severe backlash.

After eliminating those elixirs, the golden hand did not stop. It seemed to have been provoked and pressed toward those pale-faced alchemists.

Despair, covered by the golden hand. Those people's faces showed a look of despair. Among them were at most nine-source heavenly emperors, and they could not resist the hand that required careful attention from a saintly level. How could they fight back?

"Is this to kill those who refined Supreme-grade elixirs?" People's eyes showed disbelief. They hadn't expected that these alchemists would not only fail to refine their elixirs but also lose their lives.

However, the scene people saw did not appear. The golden hand stopped just before touching those people and seemed to sense their nine-source heavenly emperor cultivation, then it shattered with a terrifying storm that swept across the platform again.

Those one hundred and fifty people who had refined Supreme-grade elixirs were all swept by the storm, their bodies shattered and injured. However, they weren't killed; after some rest, they would fully recover. But this incident planted a shadow in their hearts. Without strength, refining Supreme-grade elixirs was dangerous. Only saints could refine them.

"Unfortunately!" People showed a sense of nostalgia, not expecting that refining Supreme-grade elixirs would have such an incident.

After this storm, only nine people remained on the platform: the top young prodigies of the Fire Region.

"These nine people truly deserve to be the princes and princesses of the Fire Region. They were unaffected by the terrifying energy, and it seems they had also refined Supreme-grade elixirs. It's unclear whether they had refined the initial-level or middle-level Supreme-grade elixir."

"However, no matter who refined an initial-level or a middle-level Supreme-grade elixir, it was already amazing. Their fame would spread throughout the entire Fire Region!" People looked at these nine people on the platform with a sense of expectation, their eyes looking at them and whispering among themselves.

Time passed slowly. It had been nearly three hours when the increasingly dense and difficult-to-breathe atmosphere in the sky finally caused one of the nine people on the platform to emit a wave.

Again, light and color spread everywhere. A powerful holy atmosphere rose from the cauldron before a young man.

"Nine Turn Flame Elixir! Completed!" The young man shouted, and the sun rose. Light spread everywhere, as if a dominant figure had appeared in the entire world. The golden elixir flew out of the cauldron, beginning to draw in the surrounding spiritual energy from the grass and trees.

An invisible windstorm formed on people's bodies, making them feel as if all the spiritual energy from the surrounding grass and trees had been instantly drained.

The young man's face showed a hint of joy. He looked at the elixir that satisfied him in the sky, his eyes showing a hint of expectation.

At the same time, other people's cauldrons also emitted waves. One elixir appeared in people's sight.

"A Single Thought to Complete the Elixir!" A low shout rose from the platform. Ma Tianyang slowly opened his eyes and pointed with one hand, golden spiritual power forming a series of seals that flew from his fingers. They gradually shrank and wrapped around the elixir he had refined.

"This is the 'Single Thought to Complete the Elixir' method of the Shanhai Sect. I didn't expect Ma Tianyang to have mastered it. He truly deserves being the prince of the Shanhai Sect. It seems he had prepared well for this marriage competition!"

"Yes, after all, Ma Tianyang was originally the prince of the Shanhai Sect and was destined to be with Princess Du Yuying. I suppose he must not have felt good about this elixir competition!" People discussed among themselves, looking at Ma Tianyang on the platform who seemed like a king.

"I wonder if I can witness the other two great sects' methods of completing elixirs. If I do, it would be worth the trip!" People's faces showed a sense of expectation as they looked at Lu Tianyu and Jin Tianlu.

The two did not disappoint people. They opened their eyes, and a powerful aura rose from them. A golden toad was formed by Jin Tianlu, who smiled and controlled the golden toad to swallow the golden spiritual elixir into its body.

On the other side, Lu Tianyu also smiled faintly. Golden spiritual power surged like an ocean and struck the golden elixir, as if a full moon floating in a golden sea.

"The Golden Toad Sect's Golden Toad Emerges, the Qichao Temple's Moon Rises from the Sea. Indeed, the methods of completing elixirs passed down for countless generations by the three great sects have been mastered by these princes!" People became completely excited. They hadn't expected to witness such a rare method of completing elixirs during this marriage competition.

"Country bumpkin, you're still refining the elixir?" When you complete it, all the spiritual energy from the surrounding grass and trees would have been drained. Then I'll see how you complete it.

Eight sun-like elixirs continuously absorbed the spiritual energy from the surrounding grass and trees. However, it was clearly impractical for eight Supreme-grade elixirs to be completed at the same time.

hah2

Chapter 891: Shaking Heaven ()

The square of the Shanhai Sect was filled with dark clouds, as if it had plunged into endless darkness. Beneath the dark clouds were eight elixirs radiating a holy brilliance, continuously absorbing spiritual energy from the surrounding grass and trees.

In just a moment, eight elixirs had drained all the spiritual energy from the surrounding grass and trees, causing the faces of the eight people to slightly frown.

"Still not enough!" Ma Tianyang whispered, his gaze sweeping over the people who had previously refined Imperial-grade elixirs.

The others also wore thoughtful expressions, their eyes looking at the eight hundred people and showing a hint of smiles.

"Let me borrow your elixirs for a moment!" Jin Tianlu was the first to speak. He pointed his finger, and the golden elixir on top of him glowed again with a terrifying pressure that swept toward the eight hundred people.

"Boom... Boom..." The eight hundred elixirs, which had just been stored in jade bottles, directly turned into powder and transformed into a thick spiritual energy that rushed toward Ma Tianyang's elixir.

The eight hundred people looked unhappy. Although it was not a big loss if they had truly refined a Supreme-grade elixir, the feeling of having their carefully crafted elixirs shattered and merged was somewhat uncomfortable.

Seeing Ma Tianyang's actions, the others also followed suit, beginning to plunder the spiritual energy that was extremely concentrated. Only Lu Han Tian and Du Yuying did not act.

After plundering the eight hundred Imperial-grade elixirs, Ma Tianyang and others still frowned. The elixirs were indeed impressive but clearly not enough to withstand the elixir trial of a Supreme-grade.

"Still not enough!" The eight people looked at each other, and finally Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu's faces flashed with coldness.

"You don't want to be destroyed, so explode your elixirs!" Ma Tianyang's face was cold as he looked at those young prodigies, showing a hint of coldness. Jin Tianlu also had an aura of killing intent as he looked at the four people.

"This..." Hearing Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu's words, the four people's faces turned extremely deep. They hadn't expected Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu to be so shameless.

"Why don't you want to? You have three breaths. If you don't explode your elixirs, I'll destroy your sect!" The two spoke solemnly, their killing intent gradually gathering.

"Explosion..." The four people's faces were dark and almost dripping with water, but the three great sects' princes weren't people they could afford to offend. This was the strength of the three great sects.

As the four people complied, four golden lights exploded in the sky, forming a torrent of spiritual energy that rushed toward Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu's elixirs as four long dragons.

Du Yuying and Lu Han Tian remained calm, watching Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu's actions. When the four long dragons rushed toward their elixirs, both of them had sharp eyes and pointed their fingers. The two long dragons were forcibly pulled out by the two of them, rushing into their elixirs.

"You!" Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu's faces turned dark. They hadn't expected to be the villains, but they had been robbed of their fruits by the two.

After absorbing the spiritual energy from four Supreme-grade elixirs, only four people's elixirs remained in the sky, radiating a golden glow.

"Damn it, still not enough! Not complete!" Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu's faces were dark. They looked at each other, then turned their eyes to Lu Han Tian.

Lu Han Tian nodded slightly. His aura suddenly rose. A terrifying golden spiritual power rushed toward Lu Han Tian's elixir.

"Haha, you two are going to attack me?" Lu Han Tian smiled, looking at the two of them. His body also emitted a sound like flowing water and thunder, with golden spiritual power bursting out. It collided with the two spiritual powers of Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu.

"Boom..." When the three spiritual powers collided, an explosion sound echoed in people's ears. Du Yuying pouted and showed a look of anger, watching her elixir explode in the sky. She stomped her foot in frustration.

The spiritual energy immediately poured out, making Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu's faces show great joy. They rushed to plunder Du Yuying's spiritual energy.

"Still, you have to go through me first!" Lu Tianyu laughed and waved his hand. He joined Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu in plundering Du Yuying's spiritual energy.

"Really a great performance!" People watching the three on the platform showed admiration, forgetting about Lu Tian's existence. Obviously, in people's eyes, although Lu Tian was extraordinary, he still had a significant gap compared to Ma Tianyang and others.

"Boom... Boom..." Golden light radiated everywhere. While Ma Tianyang and the three were fighting over spiritual energy, the overlooked Lu Tian emitted a series of booming sounds. Golden light was like before.

The golden elixir slowly rose from the Zhenhun Cauldron. At the same time, Lu Tian's eyes slowly opened with a hint of joy: "Good luck!"

Lu Tian wiped the sweat from his forehead. For Lu Tian, who was refining a middle-level Supreme-grade elixir for the first time, it had been exhausting. There were several times when he almost failed but managed to push through.

"Is it Lu Tian from the Tongtian Sect!" People saw another golden light rising and were momentarily shocked, then remembered Lu Tian's existence.

Lu Tian felt that Ma Tianyang and the others were fighting over spiritual energy. His face was also momentarily shocked, his eyes showing a golden light, and a mischievous smile appeared on his lips.

"Kid, explode your elixir or the Tongtian Sect will be destroyed soon!" Ma Tianyang sneered and shouted at Lu Tian, as he had done with those people before.

Hearing Ma Tianyang's lofty words, the four disciples from sects that were on par with Tongtian Sect looked slightly embarrassed.

"Idiot!" Lu Tian shook his head lightly. He wouldn't care about Ma Tianyang's threat. It was a rare opportunity to successfully refine a middle-level Supreme-grade elixir, and Lu Tian wouldn't give it up.

"Shaking Heaven!" Lu Tian's hands formed a gesture, ignoring Ma Tianyang's threat. His eyes showed joy and complex seals flew out from his hands.

A series of seals formed into golden marks that flew from Lu Tian's hands, carrying his spiritual power and rushing toward the golden elixir.

"What is this..." Seeing Lu Tian's method, Du Hongtao and Jin Jingtian and Lu Han Tian's faces changed. They suddenly stood up, their faces showing a hint of disbelief.

"Shaking Heaven's Method to Complete the Elixir! The method of completing elixirs used by the former regional master, Gu Tianshu!" Du Hongtao's voice trembled as he looked at the seals flying out from Lu Tian's hands.

"How could it be? It was said that Gu Tianshu had been suppressed by the heavenly forces and marked with a crime, eventually becoming a recluse. From then on, the Gu family declined and went into exile beyond the region. The Shaking Heaven Method of completing elixirs was also lost. How could it be! What is the relationship between this young man and Gu Tianshu!" Lu Han Tian also spoke loudly, clearly not believing what he saw.

"It's definitely correct. This method is even more complex than the methods of our three great sects, and the momentum is definitely not wrong. The feeling of dissatisfaction with heaven and earth is absolutely the Shaking Heaven Method of completing elixirs. It's amazing that this method, which had been lost for so long, has reappeared!" Jin Jingtian's eyes were hot as he looked at Lu Tian.

The people around showed confusion, not knowing why the three sect masters were so excited. The era of Gu Tianshu had passed for a long time, and obviously the people didn't know about this figure.

While people were shocked, Lu Tian's seals were finally completed. They formed a spiritual power net that slowly gathered and wrapped around the golden elixir.

"Buzz..." A series of buzzing sounds formed in the sky. A terrifying suction force immediately came from Lu Tian's elixir, causing Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu to pause. They looked at Lu Tian's elixir.

Golden light shone brightly, lighting up the entire sky. If the three people's elixirs were stars, then Lu Tian's elixir was a true sun. In the dark sky, it illuminated the entire Shanhai Sect like daylight.

"Come to me!" Lu Tian's face showed a hint of confidence. He waved his hand, and an invisible windstorm immediately absorbed the spiritual energy that Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu were fighting over, merging it into his elixir.

"You!" Seeing Lu Tian's actions, the three people's faces changed. They were clearly angered by Lu Tian's strength. Even Lu Tianyu frowned slightly, and a hint of battle spirit arose.

"You dare to do this!" Ma Tianyang's face showed an icy killing intent. Without Du Yuying's spiritual energy, his elixir was still not complete.

"You're looking for death!" Jin Tianlu also had a killing intent, his eyes showing an extreme coldness. Finally, Ma Tianyang looked at him and nodded slightly.

"Break it!" Both of them shouted and controlled their elixirs to collide with Lu Tian's elixir on top.

"Fireflies' light, also wants to compete with the moon!" Lu Tian showed contempt. His long hair flowed as he faced their elixirs without any retreat.

"I, Lu Tian, have never feared anyone of my level. My elixir is also like this. In my eyes, you two are trash! The status of a prince means nothing to me!" Lu Tian spoke loudly. His voice carried strong confidence, and his hands formed a gesture. Golden light spread everywhere. The golden elixir, like a meteor, collided with their elixirs.

Lu Tian's words were not transmitted through sound but echoed like a rolling thunder in people's ears, causing the crowd to become chaotic.

"Wow, so cool!" Du Yuying heard Lu Tian's bold words and his expression like a king. Her two lively eyes shone with light.

"For so many years, no one has dared to scold the princes of the three great sects like this. This Lu Tian is the first!" People discussed among themselves, looking at Lu Tian with admiration and deep respect.

hah2

Chapter 892: Battle Against the Princes ()

On the platform of the Shanhai Sect, three golden lights collided with each other under everyone's eyes.

Lu Tian stood there with endless confidence. His eyes showed contempt as he looked at Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu, who had repeatedly provoked him. It was clear that this had made Lu Tian extremely annoyed. For such arrogant prodigies, defeating them in front of everyone was the best way.

Thunderous sounds filled the air as three golden elixirs collided. The sky was filled with thunder, and although the three elixirs had not truly become middle-level Supreme-grade elixirs, they were only one step away. The collision force of the three elixirs was enough to match a normal initial-level saint's attack.

The void cracked, and terrifying spiritual energy transformed into a terrifying storm that swept across the platform. This made those nine-source heavenly emperors' elixir refiners look pale again.

The storm lasted for several seconds before it calmed down. A terrifying suction force was felt on the platform again, making people look forward with anticipation.

"How is it? Who won?" Everyone held their breath and looked at the golden light absorbing a rich spiritual energy. It seemed like a king, emitting a holy atmosphere from the platform.

"Pu..." Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu's faces showed strong disbelief. They spat out blood, looking at Lu Tian.

"Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu are spitting blood! My god, the princes of the three great sects have lost!" People were in a uproar. They looked at Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu, who had spat out blood.

Lu Tian stood in place without any expression. Everything was as he expected, and his heart was impressed by the power of Gu Tianshu's Shaking Heaven Method. If he had refined an elixir, it would not have achieved this.

"Defeated by the Shaking Heaven Method of completing elixirs, it's not a disgrace!" Du Hongtao showed satisfaction on his face as he looked at Lu Tian. At this moment, Du Hongtao's attitude towards Lu Tian had changed.

Ma Feiyang felt the change in Du Hongtao's attitude. His eyes showed a hint of coldness: "No matter how the sect master protects you, you will die!"

Lu Tian's face was neither sad nor happy. He looked at Lu Tianyu with a hint of amusement: "Are you still continuing?"

"Let me give it to you!" Lu Tianyu felt he had been defeated. He could not believe that someone of his level would lose to a peer in elixir refining, which was something he had never thought of before.

At this moment, seeing Lu Tian, Lu Tianyu finally understood the truth that there are always people beyond one's understanding. The sudden emergence of Lu Tian had completely shattered his previous pride.

With a wave of his hand, the golden elixir exploded with a thunderous sound. It transformed into spiritual energy and converged toward Lu Tian's elixir.

After absorbing the spiritual energy of Lu Tianyu's elixir, Lu Tian felt that his Nine Turn Flame Elixir had finally become complete.

"Below is the real opponent!" Lu Tian looked at the gathering storm clouds in the sky, his face showing a hint of seriousness. He knew that the true test for the elixir was about to come.

"The final step is to refine a middle-level Supreme-grade elixir!" People became excited again. If Lu Tian managed to complete the elixir, it was clear that he would be the winner of this marriage competition.

" I want you to die!" Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu both filled with killing intent, looking at Lu Tian. Their auras rose to the sky.
