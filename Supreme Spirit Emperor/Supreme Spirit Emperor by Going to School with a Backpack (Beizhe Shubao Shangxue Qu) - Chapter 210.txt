“Damn it, you dare to look down on my noble Yinming Ghost Fox? If you’re talking about a bet, I’ll accept it!” Diao Dezhu’s eyes flashed with madness, as if he had been provoked again.

“Three Sacred Artifacts, one hundred middle-grade Sacred Pills, and five hundred low-grade Sacred Pills! Also, the loser must call the winner grandpa three times!” Feng Jiutian smiled lightly, raising his hand. Three golden Sacred Artifacts materialized before the onlookers’ eyes.

“Qishui Sword, Fenghuang Bell, Huanyan Hammer!” Upon seeing the three Sacred Artifacts, Diao Dezhu clenched his teeth in fury. These very artifacts had once been lost to Feng Jiutian.

The onlookers collectively inhaled sharply, murmuring that the stakes were impossibly high. Not only were the three Sacred Artifacts priceless, but even the one hundred middle-grade and five hundred low-grade Sacred Pills were immeasurable in value.

“Fine, Feng Jiutian. If you want to play, I’ll match you. Raise the stakes—five Sacred Artifacts, three hundred middle-grade Sacred Pills, and one thousand low-grade Sacred Pills! Are you brave enough to gamble?” Diao Dezhu’s eyes turned blood-red, his voice cold like a gambler’s.

“Uh…” Feng Jiutian hesitated slightly before his gaze darkened. He noticed Diao Dezhu was truly provoked and smiled again, nodding slightly.

A ripple of astonishment spread through the crowd. Both humans and beasts took sharp breaths, their faces filled with awe as they gazed at Feng Jiutian and Diao Dezhu. They hadn’t expected such a high-stakes gamble—each Sacred Pill was an unattainable treasure, yet both treated them like trash, wagering a thousand in one go.

Luo Tian observed silently. Though the Demon Realm claimed unity against external beast races, it was clear that the Eight Sacred Clans were far from harmonious. The mutual hostility between Feng Jiutian’s group and Diao Dezhu’s was evident.

Moreover, Luo Tian noticed that the Feng Clan had ties to the Divine Race. Though Feng Jiutian appeared to seek trouble with Diao Dezhu, it could also be interpreted as Feng Jiutian coming to aid the Divine Race. Otherwise, why would he arrive so swiftly?

“Deep waters,” Luo Tian sighed inwardly, his gaze shifting to the three from the Thunder Domain.

Luo Tian recognized the three—earlier, he had met them outside Sacred City. The leader was a young man named Li Maode; the other two were unfamiliar to him, remembered only through Du Hongtao’s accounts. Li Maode was the son of Li Xingteng, headmaster of the Thunder Clan.

As Luo Tian observed the three from the Thunder Domain, their expressions were equally disdainful. They scrutinized Luo Tian with contempt.

“Bet!” Feng Jiutian’s face flickered with madness. Unlike Diao Dezhu, the Feng Clan was a vast lineage; he couldn’t decide alone. He needed to match Diao Dezhu’s stakes.

Indeed, the entire Demon Realm’s youth considered Diao Dezhu the richest—his Yinming Ghost Fox Clan had only two members.

After finalizing their plans, they transformed into streaks of light toward the Sacred City’s arena. It was a place for settling personal disputes.

Beast races were naturally belligerent, so the arena was always bustling. Waves of terrifying energy constantly emanated from it, sending shivers through onlookers as blood qi surged into their senses.

Streaks of light zipped past. No one would miss this legendary gamble. Within moments, the news spread across the Sacred City. Countless beasts and humans flocked to witness who would win this monumental bet.

Six of the Eight Sacred Clans’ young leaders arrived. The arena made no delay, swiftly arranging a space for Diao Dezhu’s group.

“Go on, Luo Tian. Beat him! A mere Thunder Domain scum—kill him without a problem. If anything happens, I’ll cover for you!” Diao Dezhu sneered, now that the stakes were set. Feng Jiutian couldn’t back out now.

On the other side, Feng Jiutian also told Li Maode to kill Luo Tian on stage.

“Feng Brother, this is trivial. I can handle it myself. A mere Transcendent—kill him and that’s it!” A thin youth beside Li Maode spoke coldly, attempting to ingratiate himself with Feng Jiutian.

“Good! Decide among yourselves who will go. Just kill the kid. Whoever does it gets a hundred middle-grade Sacred Pills! Let’s share the wealth!” Feng Jiutian shrugged, unconcerned. To him, a Transcendent defeating a Half-Saint was as impossible as climbing the sky.

After deliberating, the thin youth stepped onto the platform. His eyes held disdain as he beckoned Luo Tian.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian inwardly sneered. A Half-Saint? He had no interest in such a weak opponent.

Luo Tian leapt onto the platform without striking, standing firm like a mountain. A heavy aura radiated from him.

“Kid, I’m Wang Jiuyang, heir of the Thunder Clan. Remember my name—then you can die!” Wang Jiuyang’s voice echoed, and a streak of golden lightning appeared. In an instant, he materialized before Luo Tian.

Golden Sacred Power interwoven with lightning enveloped his gaunt fist, striking toward Luo Tian.

“Too fast!” Onlookers marveled at the Thunder Clan’s speed, even Feng Jiutian’s gaze narrowed in approval.

“Hmph. Speed? I almost couldn’t escape Luo Tian’s grip before. Still talking about speed?” Diao Dezhu sneered internally, his eyes filled with disdain.

Chapter 937: Feng Clan’s Ancestral Blood

“Haha… Diao Dezhu, it seems you’ve lost. This kid’s giving up!” Feng Jiutian laughed loudly, his gaze on Luo Tian’s calm face before turning to Diao Dezhu.

“Feng Jiutian, it’s too early to say that!” Diao Dezhu retorted, his voice laced with confidence.

“Still stubborn? I’ll see…” Feng Jiutian was about to mock further when a crisp crack echoed in the crowd, startling them.

An invisible wave spread outward. Thunderous light gradually dissipated around Luo Tian and Wang Jiuyang.

Visually, Wang Jiuyang’s face was filled with disbelief. His body remained in the motion of striking, but his golden fist was clutched tightly by Luo Tian.

“You actually wanted to kill me!” Luo Tian’s cold voice sent a shiver through Wang Jiuyang, who snapped back to reality.

“Speed’s decent. But your power isn’t enough. To kill me, you’re not ready yet!” Luo Tian smiled, his grip on Wang Jiuyang’s fist causing a crackling sound.

“Ah…” Wang Jiuyang roared, feeling his fist crack. If it lasted longer, it would be crushed. He struggled to pull free.

But in the next moment, Wang Jiuyang felt no progress despite his effort. Even the ground cracked under his feet, yet he couldn’t budge.

“Tsk tsk. You think you can trample me, Luo Tian? You’re all trash wanting to step on me. The Thunder Domain is only second to the Flame Domain—what right do you have to look down on it?” Luo Tian mocked, grabbing Wang Jiuyang and hurling him onto the platform.

Rocks flew up. The arena, blessed by the Eight Sacred Clans’ elders, cracked under the impact. Wang Jiuyang spat blood, his face filled with disbelief as his body seemed to disintegrate.

“You’re not a Transcendent—definitely not!” Wang Jiuyang shouted, his eyes filled with resentment.

“Since when did I say I was a Transcendent?” Luo Tian smiled, soaring into the sky. Golden light radiated from him as he looked down on Wang Jiuyang.

“Thunder Domain, hah! You’re nothing!” Luo Tian sneered, scanning Feng Jiutian and Li Maode before plummeting like a meteor toward Wang Jiuyang.

A golden-clad foot descended heavily, blood mist rising. In an instant, Wang Jiuyang was reduced to a mist of blood, scattering across the arena as a fallen soul.

“You…” Feng Jiutian’s face darkened. It wasn’t Wang Jiuyang’s death he cared about, but the staggering stakes.

“Luo Tian!” Li Maode and another Thunder Domain prodigy glared at Luo Tian, their eyes filled with killing intent. Luo Tian’s words had publicly humiliated the Thunder Domain, an insult no proud youth could bear.

“Haha, brother, I was wrong. You don’t curse me! You’re my good luck charm!” Diao Dezhu leaped joyfully, shouting.

Long Yongfu and Jin Tianshu were equally stunned. They hadn’t expected Diao Dezhu’s new friend to be so fierce—killing a Half-Saint with one kick, even a Thunder Domain prodigy.

“Come on, Jiutian. Let’s settle this!” Diao Dezhu flew to Feng Jiutian, his face brimming with triumph. For years, Diao Dezhu’s group had lost more than won. Now, for the first time, they felt triumphant—Diao Dezhu nearly floated off the ground.

“Diao Dezhu, you’re despicable! This kid definitely isn’t a Transcendent—he’s a Saint!” Feng Jiutian’s face was filled with resentment. He had intended to say Luo Tian was a Half-Saint, but recalling his earlier claim that Transcendents and Half-Saints were the same rank, he raised his suspicion another level.

“You…?” Feng Jiutian’s face reddened, a hint of ferocity. He glanced at the crowd’s stares and reluctantly handed Diao Dezhu a storage ring.

“Haha, thanks!” Diao Dezhu’s face bloomed with joy. He held the ring and returned to Long Yongfu and Jin Tianshu.

“Come on, share the spoils! We’re all brothers!” Diao Dezhu announced loudly, distributing the loot before Feng Jiutian.

Seeing Diao Dezhu’s smugness, Feng Jiutian felt his heart bleed. He now understood Diao Dezhu had been scheming from the start. There was no way he didn’t know Luo Tian was a Half-Saint or early Saint. His earlier fear and concern were all for show.

Realizing this, Feng Jiutian’s face darkened further. He had always outwitted Diao Dezhu, but now he was outwitted in return. How could he tolerate it?

“Diao Dezhu, are you still gambling?” Feng Jiutian’s face was wild as he gazed at Diao Dezhu.

“No,” Diao Dezhu replied calmly, nearly causing Feng Jiutian to explode. He hadn’t expected Diao Dezhu—so proud and haughty—to answer like this. For a moment, he was speechless.

Hu Xiangyang and Shi Hongtu’s faces were filled with disbelief. They couldn’t fathom how Diao Dezhu, usually quick to anger, had suddenly changed his demeanor.

“Alas, not only am I undefeated in cultivation, but also in gambling. Loneliness… Feng Jiutian, don’t you see? I just wanted to let you lose less. You understand, right?” Diao Dezhu sighed, adopting a sage-like posture as he addressed Feng Jiutian—opposite his earlier arrogance.

“Damn it, I forgot about this. Diao Dezhu always boasts after winning. This time, he’ll be bragging for years!” Feng Jiutian and his companions grimaced, recalling Diao Dezhu’s habit.

“Alright, let’s wrap it up. This legendary gamble will become a legend in the Demon Realm. Feng Jiutian, you’re honored—future generations might remember your name!” Diao Dezhu grandly pontificated, his eyes more filled with melancholy.

“You motherf***er, it’s your own fault for boasting! If you hadn’t said it, who the hell would know!” Feng Jiutian and his companions mentally cursed but held their tongues. They knew one retort would make Diao Dezhu even more unbearable.

Long Yongfu and Jin Tianshu wore forced smiles. Diao Dezhu had many virtues, but his boasting was unbearable.

Luo Tian was also speechless. His initial irritation eased slightly due to Diao Dezhu’s antics, and he smiled waiting for Diao Dezhu’s next move.

“Alas… loneliness…” Diao Dezhu saw the crowd watching him eagerly, his joy deepened. He adopted a masterful posture and prepared to leave.

Seeing Diao Dezhu about to depart, Feng Jiutian knew the act was over. He sneered at Diao Dezhu: “Diao Dezhu, I think you’re too scared. Fine, it’s just a little thing. I can afford it. Consider it a gift!”

“What did you say? Never mind, I won’t argue with you. We’re no longer on the same level. Tell your elders to talk to me!” Diao Dezhu smiled, looking at Feng Jiutian as if he were a junior.

“You motherf***er!” Feng Jiutian mentally cursed, his face more scornful: “Haha, undefeated? You won’t even accept my bet. How embarrassing to say it aloud!”

Diao Dezhu’s brow furrowed slightly as he scanned Feng Jiutian and his group. Though Diao Dezhu loved to boast, he wasn’t a fool. He noticed Feng Jiutian and his group were also Half-Saints, and sighed: “Do you still have stakes? If I’m not mistaken, those were all pieced together!”

“Diao Dezhu, what do you want? It’s not about what I have—it’s about what I choose!” Feng Jiutian’s face was wild as he addressed Diao Dezhu, mirroring Diao Dezhu’s earlier demeanor. But Diao Dezhu had faked it; Feng Jiutian was genuine.

“Hmph, speak. What do you want?” Diao Dezhu smiled as he addressed Feng Jiutian.

“One drop of the Feng Clan’s Ancestral Blood!” Feng Jiutian spoke solemnly, his voice heavy with gravity as he gazed at Diao Dezhu.

“Sss…” The entire arena echoed with gasps. Even Diao Dezhu’s group was stunned, staring at Feng Jiutian in disbelief.

“The Feng Clan’s Ancestral Blood—truly a priceless treasure. How could Feng Jiutian be so desperate?” Long Yongfu and Jin Tianshu were stunned, gazing at Feng Jiutian.

Luo Tian was also shocked. This was the blood of the Feng Clan’s ancestor, a figure older than Gu Tianxi and Long Zhan tian. It was an unparalleled powerhouse. Yet the Feng Clan still preserved this blood.

After speaking, Feng Jiutian feared Diao Dezhu wouldn’t believe him. He waved his hand, and a droplet of blue blood floated from his front, ascending into the sky. The entire sky darkened in response. Even the beasts in the arena cowered, trembling without moving. Diao Dezhu’s group also shuddered, their hearts filled with a desire to kneel. The bloodline suppression was the best restraint for beasts.

Chapter 938: Battle Against Li Xingteng

Above the Demon Realm’s arena, a droplet of blue blood floated in the sky. Just one drop was enough to shake hearts, its bloodline pressure making all beasts on the arena kneel in reverence.

“How about it, Diao Dezhu? Is this bet acceptable?” Feng Jiutian’s face was fierce, his voice trembling slightly. This droplet of blood was too precious.

This blood was the last three drops remaining in the Feng Clan. One had been given to Feng Jiutian, awaiting his ascension to early Saint, where he would fuse the blood and leap to mid-Saint, subduing his era.

Now, Feng Jiutian had taken a massive risk, using it as a bet. If he lost, he would face severe punishment from the Feng Clan.

“Good! Take it back!” Diao Dezhu addressed Luo Tian’s group, reclaiming what he had distributed. He weighed it in his hand: “I bet!”

Another wave of astonishment rippled through the crowd. Their faces were stunned, gazing at the two. The previous stakes had already been legendary, but now they seemed like children playing.

“According to value, your things aren’t worth my one drop of ancestral blood,” Feng Jiutian smiled, looking at Diao Dezhu with disdain.

Diao Dezhu was momentarily stunned. Feng Jiutian’s words were indeed reasonable—ancestral blood couldn’t be measured in money, it was priceless.

“What do you want? Say it!” Diao Dezhu knew Feng Jiutian must have something in mind; otherwise, he wouldn’t have proposed ancestral blood as a bet.

“Haha, Diao Dezhu is truly Diao Dezhu. Your courage deserves admiration!”

“Good, then I’ll say it: I want you to submit to my Feng Clan!” Feng Jiutian’s lips curled slightly, his words laced with mockery.

“Boom…” Upon hearing Feng Jiutian’s words, the crowd erupted in chaos. Their faces were stunned, gazing at Feng Jiutian, silently marveling he had made Diao Dezhu the bet.

“Impossible!” Before Diao Dezhu could speak, Long Yongfu and Jin Tianshu’s faces were filled with anger as they glared at Feng Jiutian.

The Fox Clan was sensitive within the Eight Clans. Everyone knew Diao Dezhu was a thorn in the side of the Fox Clan’s ancestor, Cao Yuan Shan. Though the Fox Clan seemed isolated, Cao Yuan Shan’s strength was among the strongest in the Demon Realm. Even across the Nine Realms, few dared to challenge him. If Diao Dezhu truly lost, it would inevitably involve Cao Yuan Shan—this was a cunning move.

Diao Dezhu couldn’t gamble, meaning he had backed down. From now on, Feng Jiutian’s group would mock him at every encounter. If he gambled and lost, it would be a two-for-one deal, with the prize being a grand gift—changing the entire Demon Realm.

“Feng Clan’s Ancestral Blood! Truly precious!” Luo Tian sighed, gazing at the ancestral blood in the sky. His eyes gleamed with excitement.

“Unexpectedly found a rare ingredient for the Reincarnation Pill so quickly!” Luo Tian mentally rejoiced, clenching his fists.

Since meeting Sun Mengru, who was Su Chenyting’s reincarnation, Luo Tian had pondered how to make her remember him. Finally, from Gu Tianxi’s pills and the Hundred Chapters of Medicine in the Era Book, he discovered a method: the Reincarnation Pill.

The Reincarnation Pill was a high-grade Sacred Pill. Its effect was simple—reincarnated people would recall their past lives. Though the effect was extraordinary, it was also somewhat trivial. The required ingredients were of genius-level treasure rarity, making them unattainable for most.

Diao Dezhu stood red-faced, his face thoughtful. He was now in a difficult spot. Diao Dezhu wasn’t foolish; he knew what Feng Jiutian was scheming.

“Buzz…” As Diao Dezhu hesitated, a droplet of golden blood slowly ascended into the sky.

“Roar…” A terrifying pressure shook the beasts, their hearts trembling. A golden dragon-shaped illusion coiled in the sky, sending shivers through all.

Feng Jiutian’s earlier ancestral blood hadn’t faded yet. Now, this golden droplet of blood seemed like a blazing sun against the blue ancestral blood, unaffected by its pressure. It floated into the sky.

Feng’s cry echoed, as if stimulated by the golden blood, a crimson phoenix slowly formed. It intertwined with the golden dragon illusion, as if vying for dominance.

“This is Dragon Ancestral Blood!” Long Yongfu was stunned. As a dragon clan member, he could sense the bloodline pressure from the golden droplet. He was certain that if he absorbed it, his bloodline would undergo a profound transformation, becoming purer.

“Good thing I took one earlier from Long Jie; otherwise, this would’ve been tricky!” Luo Tian smiled, recalling how he had coerced and tricked Long Jie into giving him a droplet of blood, which had left Long Jie郁闷 for a long time.

“Is this enough?” Luo Tian smiled, addressing Feng Jiutian.

Feng Jiutian and his group’s breaths quickened. Their eyes were filled with greed, gazing at the golden blood. Their lips were dry.

“It’s enough. Though it isn’t as powerful as Feng Clan’s blood, it is truly concentrated Dragon Ancestral Blood!” Feng Jiutian spoke softly, retrieving the blue ancestral blood and addressing Luo Tian. He couldn’t fathom how Luo Tian had obtained such concentrated Dragon Clan blood.

“Good, let’s start!” Luo Tian smiled, retrieving Long Jie’s blood and handing it to Diao Dezhu.

Diao Dezhu naturally knew where this droplet of blood came from. His eyes were filled with gratitude as he accepted it.

“Who will go?” Luo Tian leapt onto the platform, his gaze filled with disdain as he looked at Feng Jiutian’s group. After all, they were just Half-Saints—come all at once, and he wouldn’t even notice them.

“Haha, who said it was us? Li Zongzhu should be arriving soon!” Feng Jiutian laughed, addressing Li Maode.

“Ah, he should be coming soon,” Li Maode smiled, knowing Luo Tian was no easy opponent. Killing Wang Jiuyang so easily proved Luo Tian had early Saint strength.

Li Maode’s words hadn’t finished when spatial waves rippled. Lightning tore through the void, and a middle-aged man clad in lightning appeared before the crowd.

“Li Zongzhu!” Feng Jiutian smiled, greeting the man with a fist bump but no grand ceremony.

“Latecomers from the Thunder Domain have troubled the Feng Clan,” Li Xingteng smiled, also giving a fist bump.

“Latecomers from the Thunder Domain have troubled me. Wang Brother’s death was indeed tragic,” Feng Jiutian said with a mournful face.

“Damn it, this acting is so fake!” Diao Dezhu sneered internally, his eyes on Li Xingteng.

Luo Tian had previously transmitted to Diao Dezhu that he feared no one of early Saint strength, which gave Diao Dezhu confidence. However, Li Xingteng was clearly no pushover. Though his cultivation was also early Saint, he was the head of the Thunder Domain’s top sect. His strength couldn’t be measured by common sense. Diao Dezhu felt a chill, gazing at Luo Tian, who remained calm.

“Alas, I still lack something. Even with such an enemy before me, he shows no fear—how could I match that?” Diao Dezhu admired Luo Tian, considering him a comrade.

Li Xingteng had received Li Maode’s transmission. He knew Wang Jiuyang was killed by Luo Tian. Upon arriving in the Demon Realm, he found a Thunder Domain member dead—this made him郁闷. His cold killing intent materialized, striking Luo Tian’s body.

He transformed into lightning and appeared on the platform before Luo Tian, beginning to scrutinize him.

Luo Tian’s name had recently become renowned in the Demon Realm. Even the Divine Race had suffered losses against him. Initially, Li Xingteng thought Luo Tian relied on cunning. Now he realized Luo Tian’s strength was undeniable.

Wang Jiuyang’s strength Li Xingteng knew well. As a prodigy, he couldn’t withstand even one kick from Luo Tian. This proved Luo Tian’s strength—though not yet a Saint, he was no match for early Saints.

“Killing my Thunder Domain prodigy. The Flame Domain is truly arrogant! How many domains have you offended?” Li Xingteng spoke coldly.

“Just the Thunder Domain. We’ve even dared to defy the Divine Race. What makes you think the Thunder Domain is strong? To me, it’s nothing. Today seeing your Thunder Domain’s greatest sect headmaster, I’m even more certain—Thunder Domain is trash!” Luo Tian smiled, his words echoing.

“Little one, you seek death!” Li Xingteng’s status was clear. Hearing Luo Tian’s words, he couldn’t bear it. Killing intent surged as he transformed into lightning and rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Knowing I’m a junior, yet still attacking me. Thunder Domain people are truly shameless! Today I’ll make you remember—trash is always trash!” Luo Tian showed no fear, throwing out a golden array banner from his sleeve. His aura surged as he transformed into a storm and rushed toward Li Xingteng.

“Indeed, an early Saint!” The crowd was stunned. They gasped in awe at Luo Tian’s cultivation. To be an early Saint so young was unfathomable.

A sense of defeat spread among the crowd, especially among Feng Jiutian and other young prodigies from the Demon and Thunder Domains. Guessing was one thing, but seeing it with their own eyes was another. Now they understood that their prodigies were nothing compared to Luo Tian.

Chapter 939: Heavenly Mechanism Thunder Step

In the Demon Realm’s arena, as people were still stunned by Luo Tian’s formidable strength, Li Xingteng and Luo Tian had already clashed.

Golden lightning collided with golden storms, producing a deafening sound. Both figures retreated simultaneously, their terrifying waves striking the arena’s sturdy barrier.

“Evenly matched!” Diao Dezhu was excited, gazing at Luo Tian. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be evenly matched with Li Xingteng, a formidable opponent.

Feng Jiutian and others were equally stunned. They had thought Li Xingteng’s arrival would be foolproof, but Luo Tian was so powerful it exceeded their comprehension.

The onlookers wore expressions of admiration. They gazed at Luo Tian standing proudly, able to battle an elder who had reached early Saint for years. This proved Luo Tian’s strength.

Li Xingteng’s face was filled with caution. Though they had only fought briefly, his lightning attacks numbered dozens. Yet Luo Tian blocked each one—this was truly astonishing.

“Speed and power are decent. Better than that waste, Wang Jiuyang!” Luo Tian smiled lazily, having assessed Li Xingteng’s strength. This man was stronger than Du Hongtao, roughly matching Lu Han Tian’s strength.

“Is this what you call the head of the Thunder Domain’s strongest sect?” Luo Tian sneered, clenching his fists. He didn’t retreat but advanced, emitting a green dragon-shaped illusion. It resembled a humanoid beast as he rushed toward Li Xingteng.

Assessing Li Xingteng’s strength, Luo Tian no longer held back. He launched a punch toward Li Xingteng’s chest with terrifying Sacred Power.

“Little one, you seek death!” Hearing Luo Tian’s mockery, Li Xingteng’s eyes flashed with madness. He no longer held back, gathering Sacred Power and clashing with Luo Tian again.

The deafening sound returned. This time, however, it wasn’t both figures retreating—Li Xingteng was stunned and took a few steps back, while Luo Tian stood unmoved.

Luo Tian didn’t give Li Xingteng a moment to recover. He transformed into a streak of golden light, appearing before Li Xingteng again. One punch, two punches, three…

Luo Tian’s fists radiated terrifying Sacred Power, each strike carrying overwhelming might toward Li Xingteng.

Li Xingteng’s eyes flickered with fear. Luo Tian’s fists were like raindrops, leaving him no time to react. He could only strike back with each punch.

“Subdued!” Diao Dezhu shouted excitedly, his eyes filled with admiration as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“Damn it, Thunder Domain people are all trash. One Luo Tian can’t even subdue!” Feng Jiutian’s face darkened, gazing at Li Xingteng subdued by Luo Tian. He spoke bitterly, thinking about the Feng Clan’s ancestral blood he had risked.

Time passed slowly. Under the crowd’s awe, Li Xingteng finally couldn’t hold on. His face was pale, blood trickled from his lips as he collided with the surrounding green barrier.

“Alas, I’m undefeated in my rank. My friend is also undefeated in his rank. Loneliness…” Diao Dezhu returned to his nature, gazing at Feng Jiutian.

“Damn it!” Feng Jiutian’s face was fierce, gazing at Luo Tian and Li Xingteng within the barrier. He looked at Diao Dezhu’s smug face and wished to strangle him.

“Cough… cough…” Li Xingteng slowly stood up, his sunken chest radiating lightning as he healed his injuries.

Luo Tian remained standing. He knew this attack wouldn’t kill Li Xingteng. His reason for using such a method was purely to vent.

Since arriving in the Demon Realm, Luo Tian had been insulted. Though he eventually resolved it, it still left him annoyed. Especially after finding Chen Yunting, he couldn’t meet or recognize her, leaving his heart in turmoil. Wang Jiuyang was too weak before. Now this Li Xingteng was perfect—a free sandbag to vent on.

“Hmph… I feel better now. Then you can die,” Luo Tian’s hands changed, releasing a thunderous print with overwhelming pressure and the梵天 attack. It left no chance for resistance.

“What technique is this? So powerful!” Li Xingteng’s face was filled with fear, gazing at the thunderous print that had already wounded him. His expression was terrified.

“Kid, though you subdued me, your power isn’t enough to kill me. You’re not ready yet!” Li Xingteng’s eyes also showed desperation, his hands forming a seal. Golden lightning radiated from him, creating a sea of thunder.

“Buzz…” A humming sound echoed. Countless lightning bolts formed a golden bridge, its power formidable.

“Thunder Bridge!” Li Maode’s face lit up with excitement. He gazed at the lightning bridge on the platform, his expression filled with joy.

“There’s a chance! This is my Thunder Domain’s treasure. It might subdue this kid!” Li Maode spoke solemnly, his voice reaching Feng Jiutian’s ears. This made Feng Jiutian’s heart stir. He had heard elders speak of the Thunder Bridge, a treasure passed down through generations in the Thunder Domain. It was undoubtedly an elite Sacred Artifact.

One bridge, one print—terrifying pressure instantly struck Luo Tian and Li Xingteng. Their robes flapped wildly, and Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed as he gazed at the lightning bridge.

“Not enough with just one thunderous print!” Luo Tian had seen this Thunder Bridge before outside Sacred City, thinking it was merely a tool for the Thunder Domain to travel.

Golden lightning transformed into countless thunder serpents, slithering along the bridge. This increased its power by threefold.

“Subdue!” Li Xingteng’s face was filled with killing intent. He formed a seal, commanding the Thunder Bridge to crush Luo Tian.

“Go!” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate. Drawn by the Thunder Bridge, he controlled the golden print in the sky to strike the bridge.

“Crackling Spear!” Luo Tian’s hands moved, and a golden spear appeared. A storm of spears surrounded him, rushing toward the Thunder Bridge.

“Boom… boom…” The deafening sound echoed. The entire platform’s sky resounded with powerful thunder, shaking the arena three times under the crowd’s fear. The Thunder Bridge clashed violently with Luo Tian’s two techniques.

Visually, the Thunder Bridge dimmed significantly. Its massive body had cracks, and Luo Tian’s techniques were neutralized, creating a powerful wind that struck the barrier.

“What technique is this? Its attack is terrifying! It even cracked my Thunder Bridge!” Li Xingteng was stunned, gazing at Luo Tian. This was his first time seeing the Thunder Bridge damaged.

His face paled, but before he could think further, he felt a sharp sensation in his perception.

Golden light spread. A humming sound echoed in Li Xingteng’s ears. A cold, sharp edge pierced his shoulder, startling him.

This was only because Li Xingteng reacted quickly. If not for his years of instinct, this cold sensation would have pierced his heart.

“Pf…” Blood mist scattered. The golden spear tip was stained with golden Sacred Blood. Luo Tian smiled playfully, holding the crackling spear and gazing at Li Xingteng.

“Daring to show speed in front of me? You don’t know how to write ‘death’!” Li Xingteng sneered, his face pale but eyes filled with disdain. He moved like lightning, a thunderous sword materializing in his hand.

“Fast!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed slightly. Even his spiritual sense could barely match Li Xingteng’s speed.
