The black whip, made of unknown material, instantly fragmented into pieces and fell to the ground. Luo Tian's figure appeared before Chu Chen and Black Snake.

"How is this possible!" Black Snake was utterly stunned. This whip had been discovered by him in an ancient ruin, even Xuan She, the leader of Furious Sand, could not break it. How could this dwarf-like man possess such immense power?

"Send you to the afterlife!" At that moment, Luo Tian had gained confidence. Recalling the scene he just remembered, he realized he must have been incredibly powerful before. With a step on the earth, he instantly appeared before Black Snake.

A straightforward punch struck Black Snake's massive body, producing a crisp crackling sound. Though Black Snake was at the early Saint stage, stronger than his subordinates, it was only slightly so. Under Luo Tian's full power punch, Black Snake's flesh gradually cracked and spread across his entire body.

"Was one punch not enough?" Luo Tian mused, immediately delivering another punch, turning Black Snake's massive body into a cloud of blood.

"Too fierce!" Chu Chen watched Luo Tian, realizing he had found a treasure. He never imagined that this small figure contained such immense energy—Saint rank! Two punches and Black Snake was dead!

Blood slowly coalesced, forming Black Snake's figure before Luo Tian and Chu Chen. His cultivation had dropped to just beyond the Saint stage. Black Snake's eyes were filled with terror, staring at Luo Tian, utterly shaken by him.

"Grandfather, mercy! Grandfather, mercy!" Seeing Luo Tian approach again, Black Snake immediately knelt on the ground, bowing and pleading for mercy. His massive head repeatedly struck the earth with a thunderous sound.

Chapter 1223: Regardless of Circumstances

"Boom... boom..." The thunderous sound echoed as Black Snake's large head repeatedly struck the ground, begging Luo Tian for mercy.

"Go on, lead the way!" Luo Tian spoke, commanding Black Snake to stop. He stood on the ground, gazing at the much larger Black Snake.

"Lead where?" Black Snake's face showed confusion upon hearing Luo Tian's words, momentarily failing to grasp what Luo Tian meant. Even Chu Chen was puzzled.

"To your Furious Sand's stronghold!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with a faint smile, his voice cold. Yet it made Black Snake tremble. Looking at Luo Tian, he displayed disbelief.

South Ridge Furious Sand—everyone knew of them. Even Qinghe City could do nothing against them. This slender youth, yet immensely powerful, sought to enter their stronghold alone. Such a claim would be dismissed by anyone.

"Luo... brother! Let's return to discuss it first. South Ridge Furious Sand is renowned across the region. Their leader, Xuan She, is at the middle Saint stage—one of the strongest in South Ridge!" Chu Chen, upon hearing Luo Tian's words, quickly stood up and spoke.

"Very well!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly. He desperately wanted to recover his memories. The battle with the thirty-plus Furious Sand bandits had given him fragments of memory. Luo Tian was certain those were memories from before he lost his mind. Since combat had proven useful, he intended to keep fighting to recover his memories.

For some reason, Luo Tian felt a sense of panic, as if failing to recover his memories would cause him to lose something vital.

Yet he could not ignore Chu Chen's words. After all, he still didn't know his true strength. He only knew he was at the Saint stage; what level it was, he could not yet confirm.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian spoke to Black Snake, his voice calm. He led Black Snake toward the stone fortress.

On their return journey, Chu Chen no longer dared to carry Luo Tian on his shoulders. His gaze toward Luo Tian had changed.

Seeming to notice the reverence in Chu Chen's eyes, Luo Tian shook his head and smiled. He leaped onto Chu Chen's shoulders.

"Relax, I haven't changed!" Luo Tian spoke softly, returning to his former self. His eyes held a smile as he lightly patted Chu Chen's shoulder.

"Ah!" Chu Chen smiled awkwardly, nodding heavily as he marched forward.

"No matter what, you are my savior. You are my brother, Luo Tian!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his mind recalling vague faces as he said the word "brother."

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Chu Chen felt a warmth in his heart. The word "brother" was something he had only known within the stone fortress. Even his half-brothers had tried to kill him. Yet Luo Tian, a man he'd known for only three days, called him brother. He could sense that Luo Tian meant it sincerely.

"What if I regain my memories, and my hands are stained with blood? What if we end up opposing each other for some reason—will you still acknowledge me as your brother?" Luo Tian gazed at his hands, as if seeing countless bloodstains and souls.

"Never. Even if you were once a merciless demon, you are still my brother, Chu Chen. No matter what you become, I will never be your enemy!" Chu Chen's expression turned solemn as he gazed into the distance, his tall figure appearing unusually upright.

Black Snake followed behind them, listening to their conversation with a hint of envy, recalling his own perilous life within Furious Sand.

Since they hadn't traveled far, Luo Tian and Chu Chen soon returned to the stone fortress with Black Snake.

As they entered the fortress, its men and women immediately saw Black Snake behind Chu Chen. They rushed home to grab weapons, surrounding Chu Chen and Black Snake.

"Free Chu Chen! How long has it been? Are you already breaking your word?" The fortress people shouted at Black Snake, thinking he had kidnapped Chu Chen.

"Don't worry! I wasn't taken hostage—he was captured by me!" Chu Chen, seeing the people of the fortress, felt a warmth in his chest and spoke.

"What? Black Snake was captured by Chu Chen!" The people of the fortress displayed disbelief, gazing at Chu Chen with admiration.

"Everyone, settle your grudges and attack! But don't kill him—there's still use for him!" Chu Chen spoke to the crowd.

"Hit him!"
"Kill him!" The fortress people, hearing Chu Chen's words, grabbed their stone weapons and hurled them at Black Snake.

Black Snake glanced at Luo Tian on Chu Chen's shoulders, daring not to resist. He stood there, allowing the heavy stone weapons to strike his body.

"Chu Chen, you're back?" An old man called "Second Grandfather" stepped forward from the crowd, addressing Chu Chen.

"Yes! The thirty-plus attackers who came to besiege the fortress have been dealt with!" Chu Chen pointed at Black Snake, who was being beaten repeatedly.

"The clan leader has emerged from his retreat and wishes to see you!" The old man addressed Chu Chen, glancing at Luo Tian on his shoulders.

"You go. I'll watch over this one to prevent him from escaping!" Luo Tian chuckled, leaping off Chu Chen's shoulders and sitting on a wide stone chair.

"Right, I'll be back soon!" Chu Chen nodded and didn't think much of it, disappearing from Luo Tian's sight with the old man.

"Alas," Luo Tian softly shook his head, gazing at the people of the fortress beating Black Snake. His eyes held a hint of sorrow.

"It seems I must leave," Luo Tian's gaze carried a bitter edge. Though he had lived in the fortress for only a few days, its people and their simple lifestyle had made him reluctant to depart.

The clan leader of the fortress, whom Luo Tian had heard Chu Chen mention before, was a formidable cultivator who had been in seclusion to break through the Saint stage. It was said he had once spent time in the Wild City.

This clan leader's emergence would inevitably learn of Luo Tian's story. According to Zidian Bird's words, if the clan leader had spent time in the Wild City, he would know Luo Tian was human. To protect the fortress's safety, he might expel Luo Tian without hesitation.

Time passed slowly. The people of the fortress beat Black Snake for an hour before finally stopping.

Looking at Black Snake, he no longer resembled a human. His already massive body had grown even larger. Every part of him was injured, his bones shattered. If not for Chu Chen's prior instruction to leave Black Snake alive, he would have been killed by the fortress people.

"You are Luo Tian?" As Luo Tian had nothing to do, a deep voice echoed in the crowd's ears. Everyone immediately displayed reverence and stood still.

Then three figures emerged from the fortress depths—Chu Chen, the old man called "Second Grandfather," and the leader of the fortress. The latter was obviously the clan leader, respected by all.

The old man's body was also imposing, wearing a simple robe. His eyes flashed with radiant light as he surveyed Luo Tian sitting up.

Their gazes met, and finally, Luo Tian stood up respectfully: "Junior Luo Tian, greetings, clan leader!"

"Human! Why have you come to my South Ridge Stone Fortress?" As Luo Tian's words ended, the old man's eyes turned fierce. His voice carried authority as he questioned Luo Tian.

"Junior came here unintentionally, but I've lost my previous memories. I was偶然 rescued by Chu Chen!" Luo Tian maintained a respectful demeanor as he addressed the clan leader.

"Yes, clan leader! Let Luo Tian stay. He truly has no ill intent toward the fortress! Those thirty-plus Furious Sand bandits were all defeated by him!" Chu Chen quickly interjected.

"Chu Chen, you know that harboring a human is a crime among the蛮族 (barbarians), right? Even if he's good, he cannot stay in our fortress. If something goes wrong, it would be a catastrophe for us!" The clan leader's face turned serious as he spoke to Chu Chen.

"Junior will not trouble the fortress. However, I have a question: Elder, you once spent time in the Wild City and are well-traveled. Do you know of any method to restore one's memory?" Luo Tian asked, hoping to find a way to recover his memories from the old man. He had indeed recalled some images after killing thirty-plus Furious Sand bandits, but killing was not the solution. He couldn't kill everyone he met.

"Restoring memory?" The clan leader's brows furrowed slightly, his old eyes showing contemplation.

"You must have suffered a severe injury, damaging your soul and spirit, causing you to lose memory. Our fortress has an ancient formula that can aid in restoring the soul and spirit, though it takes time. I need to prepare for it. You must promise me that no matter if it works or not, you will leave the fortress!" The clan leader spoke with determination.

"Really?" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with excitement. He hadn't expected the fortress to have a method for restoring memory.

"Good! Junior agrees to your request!" Luo Tian's intention was to leave the fortress anyway. He didn't want to trouble the small fortress or disrupt its peace.

"Brother, you!" Chu Chen approached Luo Tian, his eyes filled with reluctance.

"Don't worry. I'm fine. Even if I leave, we might meet again someday!" Luo Tian patted Chu Chen's shoulder and comforted him.

Chapter 1224: Eliminating the Aftermath

"What's happening? Master Luo Tian, are you leaving?" The children of the fortress surrounded Luo Tian, asking.

"Ah, he's not one of us! I wondered why he was so small!" The people of the fortress murmured, looking at Luo Tian. They had learned from the clan leader's words that Luo Tian was not a member of the barbarian race and would be expelled from the fortress.

"Alas, it's better to stay! Our fortress doesn't lack one person. Luo Tian eats little!" The children were reluctant, speaking out.

"Children, what do you know? Go back to your parents!" Some adults pulled the children away, their eyes showing a hint of apology toward Luo Tian.

"Go on, before you leave, help settle the fortress's problems!" Luo Tian habitually sat on Chu Chen's shoulders, gazing at Black Snake.

"Lead the way! To your Furious Sand stronghold!" Luo Tian addressed Black Snake, making his face pale. Slowly standing up, he walked out of the fortress. Black Snake knew that Furious Sand was doomed. This human was a pestilence; none of Furious Sand could match Luo Tian.

"Human! This is what humans are like? I've heard of them before, but never seen one. Unexpectedly, humans are so strong! So small a body, yet containing such terrifying power!" Black Snake thought to himself as he led Luo Tian out of the fortress, heading toward the distance.

Only five people in the entire South Ridge could find Furious Sand's stronghold, and Black Snake was one of them. Leading Luo Tian and Chu Chen through twists and turns, they soon left the South Ridge and entered a desolate land.

The land was barren, scorched by the sun. Cracks spread across it, making Luo Tian marvel at its desolation—completely different from the South Ridge.

"Boom..." Black Snake and Chu Chen's heavy steps landed on the ground, leaving deep footprints. The air grew drier as they walked.

After an hour of travel, with Black Snake and Chu Chen's speed, they finally reached the edge of a desert.

"Ah..." A gust of wind swept through, scattering yellow sand across the sky and earth, obscuring their vision. The entire world turned into a sea of yellow.

"Just a few more steps, and we'll reach our Furious Sand stronghold!" Black Snake turned to Luo Tian and Chu Chen.

"Go on, don't try any tricks; otherwise, it'll be you who suffers!" Luo Tian gazed at the swirling yellow sand, addressing Black Snake. His mind already vaguely saw figures moving.

"Of course not! Of course not!" Black Snake, seeing Luo Tian's determined gaze, immediately suppressed his thoughts of escape. His eyes were filled with reverence.

"Better to live a miserable life than die! Why did I get caught up in this? Raiding a small fortress of two hundred people, and I met a pestilence!" Black Snake cursed himself repeatedly, leading Luo Tian toward the desert's depths.

"Master Xuan She, don't blame me! I'm doing this to save my life. Who could have known you weren't kind to me!" Black Snake comforted himself, nearing Furious Sand's stronghold.

The desert world, within the furious sandstorm, a fortress made of sand appeared in Luo Tian's view.

"This... this is it!" Black Snake spoke, his eyes filled with reverence as he addressed Luo Tian. If anyone else had not known the correct path, they would surely be lost in this vast desert.

Luo Tian gazed at the massive fortress, his eyes filled with admiration. Its style was completely different from the stone fortress. Even Chu Chen had never entered a desert before, as many had been lost in this very desert.

"Unexpectedly, Furious Sand built their stronghold here!" Chu Chen spoke softly, gazing at the sand fortress with determination. He could sense several strong auras within it, pressing heavily on him.

"Little grandfather, I've brought you here. This is my way of atoning for my sins. Will you spare my life?" Black Snake, with a fawning expression, addressed Luo Tian.

"Live a good life in your next reincarnation! I won't spare you!" Luo Tian delivered a punch, ending Black Snake's life. However, he didn't use much strength.

After killing Black Snake, Luo Tian gazed at the sand fortress under the wind, his eyes filled with a hint of killing intent. This was what he decided to do before leaving the fortress—repay its kindness by eliminating this threat.

"You stay here!" Luo Tian addressed Chu Chen, not wanting him to take risks. After all, the enemy had a Saint-level giant.

"Right!" Chu Chen nodded without hesitation. Then he said, "Be careful!"

"Just as I thought," Luo Tian mused, recalling his earlier words. "If my hands are stained with blood, will you still consider me your brother?" Chu Chen now realized he truly didn't know Luo Tian. Even without his memories, Luo Tian was still like this—his aura seemed innate, and killing was as natural to him as breathing.

"Yes!" Chu Chen remained still, allowing the blood-colored wind and sand to strike his sturdy body.

Luo Tian walked through the sand fortress like a death god emerging from hell, continuously harvesting the lives of Furious Sand bandits. No one could withstand Luo Tian's punch.

"Who are you?"
"A demon!" A scream echoed in Luo Tian's ears, but he seemed not to hear it. Everything felt natural.

"One hundred... five hundred..." Each barbarian giant fell under Luo Tian's hands, and familiar faces appeared in his mind—scenes even bloodier than the present.

"Who are you? Why do you massacre my Furious Sand?" A deep voice echoed, the massive body exuding a heavy pressure that made Luo Tian's eyes narrow slightly.

"Luotian!" Luo Tian surveyed the giant before him, his high body wrapped with a gray snake. Cold fangs made one shiver; the gray snake's eyes gazed at Luo Tian.

"You are the leader of Furious Sand, Xuan She!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with a faint smile as he gazed at the giant. There was no fear in his eyes. He could sense that Xuan She would be dead within three punches.

"Kill!" Xuan She felt Luo Tian's terrifying presence, his eyes deep and heavy. His massive body stomped on the ground, rushing toward Luo Tian with a bone-made wolf spear, which he slammed down.

"Crack..." Without hesitation, Luo Tian saw Xuan She's attack was too slow in his eyes. He raised his hand and punched, instantly shattering the sturdy wolf spear. Then he kicked Xuan She's thigh.

"Boom..." With one kick, Xuan She's massive body flew backward, his thick legs disappearing from his body.

"Hiss... hiss..." Seeing his master wounded, the gray snake merged into the ground and shot out from under Luo Tian's feet. It opened its mouth wide, rushing to bite Luo Tian.

"Beast!" Luo Tian roared, his voice carrying a strong pressure. He grabbed the gray snake's fangs with his hand and exerted strength, blood splattering as he tore the snake in half.

"You!" Xuan She's heart trembled, his eyes filled with disbelief. He knew he was defeated; Luo Tian hadn't even blocked one punch, and now he felt despair.

"I know, you are human!" Xuan She's eyes widened, his gaze filled with disbelief.

"I am a barbarian! You dare to kill me!" Xuan She shouted, his voice carrying a hint of hope.

"Boom..." But before Xuan She could finish speaking, Luo Tian's fist crashed down on his body.

"Why not! The mistake was yours for attacking the people of the fortress!" Luo Tian ignored Xuan She's words, punching repeatedly without giving him a chance to speak. He smashed the giant into a pile of meat, gradually regaining his memories.

"Buzz..." Blood-rebirth, the massive body slowly formed before Luo Tian's eyes. But before Xuan She could speak again, Luo Tian delivered another punch.

After killing Xuan She three times, he never reborn again. Luo Tian, covered in blood, walked out of the sand fortress.

"Let's go!" Seeing Chu Chen still waiting for him, Luo Tian sighed deeply. After the massacre, he seemed to recall some things. He leaped onto Chu Chen's shoulders.

Chu Chen was stunned; he hadn't expected Luo Tian to eliminate Furious Sand so quickly. This was a bandit group that had dominated the South Ridge, and no one could handle them.

The massive body disappeared into the blood-colored desert. No one knew that South Ridge's renowned Furious Sand was eradicated by Luo Tian in such a short time.

Wind and sand swept, and after about an hour, a figure emerged from the wind and sand. It smelled the blood in the air, frowning slightly.

"Who destroyed our Furious Sand? Even my brother didn't escape the poison!" Cold eyes flashed with icy intent.

"Rest easy, I'll avenge you!" The wind blew the black robe, its eyes filled with killing intent as it disappeared into the sand.

Chapter 1225: The Stone Fortress Crisis

Chu Chen and Luo Tian returned to the stone fortress at night. It was unusually quiet, with faint snoring sounds heard, making Luo Tian slightly uncomfortable.

Luo Tian cleaned the bloodstains on his body and lay down on a wide stone chair. His eyes showed confusion, pondering what path to take next, but still blank.

"Never mind, I'll wait for my memories to return," Luo Tian sighed deeply and closed his eyes.

A series of images like solid matter appeared in Luo Tian's dreams, faces of men and women, old and young. When he tried to grasp the images, he awoke again.

"Brother, you're awake!" As Luo Tian opened his eyes, he saw a pair of large eyes like copper bells staring at him. His eyes showed curiosity.

"Yes! Let's go, I suppose the clan leader has already prepared everything!" Luo Tian slowly got up and stretched his body.

"Yes," Chu Chen's thoughts were complex, placing Luo Tian on his shoulders. His eyes showed a hint of reluctance. Though they had only spent a few days together, Chu Chen had already considered Luo Tian his brother.

In the depths of the stone fortress, a tall altar stood with a stone pot on it. The clan leader stood solemnly before the pot, holding a stone book with complex characters, as if worn by time. The clan leader would read a passage and then throw several herbs into the pot.

Below the altar, the people of the fortress stood with solemn expressions, as if performing a grand ritual.

"Boom..." Heavy footsteps echoed as Luo Tian sat on Chu Chen's shoulders, appearing in the crowd's view.

"Chu Chen! Luo Tian!" Seeing Chu Chen and Luo Tian arrive, the people of the fortress stirred. They had known about Chu Chen and Luo Tian's mission yesterday. Now seeing them return, their minds were shaken.

"Furious Sand is destroyed!" Chu Chen spoke softly, his voice filled with admiration as he looked at Luo Tian on his shoulders.

"What? You really did it?" The people of the fortress displayed a hint of shock, gazing at Luo Tian. They hadn't expected this seemingly harmless human to destroy the entire Furious Sand, which had over a thousand people in the South Ridge.

"Keep this secret; no one must reveal it!" The clan leader, hearing Chu Chen's words, his old body trembled slightly. His gaze toward Luo Tian changed but then he spoke.

Though Furious Sand was destroyed, there might still be remnants. If they traced back to the stone fortress, it would be a huge trouble.

"Yes!" The people of the fortress bowed and spoke, their eyes showing joy. Furious Sand was destroyed; they no longer had to worry about them coming back to trouble the fortress. Unconsciously, their gaze toward Luo Tian turned grateful.

"Come forward!" The clan leader threw the last herb into the pot, which then boiled violently, emitting a fragrant aroma that drifted through the fortress.

"Yes!" Luo Tian's face showed excitement but he still bowed to the clan leader, stepping onto the altar.

"Enter it! I'm not sure if it will restore your memories, but you did say something before. I hope you'll keep your promise!" The clan leader's voice was resolute as he spoke to Luo Tian.

"I will!" Luo Tian nodded and leaped into the pot, allowing the boiling liquid to冲击 his body.

"O Great Barbarian God, let the child who has wandered far find his way home!" The clan leader watched Luo Tian jump in, placing his hands on his shoulders and closing his eyes to pray.

As the clan leader spoke, all the men and women of the fortress joined their hands in prayer, closing their eyes devoutly.

"Drip..." The clan leader took a bone knife and cut his palm, letting a drop of blood fall into the pot.

"Roar..." A blood-colored shadow surged upward, a massive body like a barbarian giant appearing in the crowd's view. It then dove downward toward Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." An invisible wave instantly swept over Luo Tian's body, a sense of fatigue rising in his entire being. He slowly closed his eyes.

"Whether it restores or how much depends on your own efforts!" The clan leader, who had jumped down from the altar, spoke softly.

"It's done. It will take three days. On that day, we'll know the result. That is also when he must leave the fortress!" The old man spoke to everyone.

"Grandfather of the clan, can't we keep him? After all, he has done us a favor. He destroyed Furious Sand! Driving Luo Tian away seems unjust!" Chu Chen still hadn't given up, speaking to the clan leader.

"Yes! After all, he did us a favor. I don't think Luo Tian is a bad person! What's wrong with being human!" Others also nodded in agreement. The stone fortress was clear about debts and favors. Luo Tian had destroyed Furious Sand, so he was a benefactor. Driving away a benefactor made them feel uneasy.

"Don't say more! My decision is final!" The clan leader's face showed determination. He had spent some time in the Wild City and knew how much the Wild Palace hated humans.

"Yes..." Hearing the clan leader's resolute gaze, the people of the fortress had no more words. They each hung their heads, glanced at the stone pot on the altar, and returned to their homes.

Luo Tian fell into a deep sleep, as if he had entered some special environment. He could feel the invisible power flowing into his body, making him gradually complete. A series of memories like waves surged into Luo Tian's mind.

On the other hand, in Qinghe City's official residence, Man Lie smashed a delicate stone cup with his hands. He shouted at a middle-aged man in black standing before him.

"Useless! All of you are useless! How could Furious Sand, a group so strong, fail to take down even a small fortress? What use are you?" Man Lie shouted angrily.

"Report, Young Master! I don't know why the entire Furious Sand, including my elder brother, was wiped out in less than a night. I suspect it was the work of someone at the late Saint stage, or even peak!" The black-cloaked middle-aged man showed respect. Though he was at the middle Saint stage and Man Lie was at the Supreme Rank, he dared not be reckless.

Because Man Lie's father, Man Zhen, was the governor of Qinghe City. Furious Sand had been able to be so arrogant for years because of Man Zhen's protection. If Man Zhen had truly wanted to destroy Furious Sand, it wouldn't have developed this far.

However, most of the wealth accumulated by Furious Sand over the years had flowed into Man Zhen's hands. This was why Black Snake chose to wait when he heard the fortress could produce three thousand yuan energy stones.

"Seems we have no choice but to break the seal! If the fortress can withstand my father's anger, then it's fine. But Chu Chen—this time I wonder if he'll live or die!" Man Lie's face showed a hint of killing intent as he spoke coldly. His massive body walked out of the hall toward Man Zhen's residence.

"Did you say it was true?" A middle-aged giant looked at the kneeling Man Lie, his voice filled with excitement.

"Yes, it's true! I discovered it after returning to the official residence and checking the records. The opponent was a human. That's why I wanted to use Furious Sand to capture him and present him to my father!" Man Lie showed respect, addressing the middle-aged giant.

"Hmph! If what you said is true, I won't hold it against you for using Furious Sand!" Man Zhen sneered, looking at his useless son.

But Man Zhen was secretly delighted. As the governor of Qinghe City, though it wasn't large, it was under the Wild Palace's jurisdiction. He didn't know about humans. Any barbarian who captured a human and delivered them to the Wild Palace would receive great rewards. Man Lie said this human had wiped out all of Furious Sand, and his strength was at least peak Saint. If captured, it would be a major achievement.

"Deploy troops and destroy the fortress! To secretly harbor humans is a capital crime!" Man Zhen ordered Man Lie, his voice resolute.

"Yes!" Man Lie's eyes lit up. If his father saw Chu Chen and this human being close, he would certainly be upset. In a fit of anger, he might even kill Chu Chen.

"Boom... boom..." Man Zhen's order caused the entire Qinghe City to move. A group of over two hundred warriors in armor appeared at the official residence, each with a powerful aura.

"Go!" Man Zhen led the way, flying into the sky. His massive body soared upward toward the fortress's direction.

"Yes!" The warriors, filled with battle spirit, roared and flew into the sky, following Man Zhen.

"Chu Chen! This time I wonder if you'll live or die!" Man Lie followed behind Man Zhen, his heart cold.

Chapter 1226: Awakening Memories
