“you really haven’t changed! But now you don’t have the right to be arrogant in front of me!” Shangguan Hongtu’s face bore an icy expression, his aura rising to the heavens. His gaze carried a sense of invincibility as he looked at Luotian.

“Back then I could kill you once, and I can do it again!” Luotian’s battle spirit flared. His cultivation had reached the peak of Yuanling, and he was on the verge of entering the Soul-Annihilation Realm. He met Shangguan Hongtu’s power head-on.

Yet Luotian’s aura was vastly inferior to Shangguan Hongtu’s. The disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect felt a pang of worry for Zhang Daotian.

“Kill…” Both men roared in unison, transforming into two streaks of light that rushed toward each other.

“Boom…!” A flash of brilliance erupted, and a thunderous roar echoed in people’s ears. In the next moment, Luotian’s body was sent flying backward like an arrow.

“Hmph! You haven’t even reached the Soul-Annihilation Realm. How dare you challenge me? I’m no longer the Shangguan Hongtu of before!” Shangguan Hongtu’s lips curled into a cold smile. Golden, light, and wooden primordial energies surged around him as he slammed toward Luotian.

“Tricky. My body is still too weak,” Luotian muttered, blood trickling from his lips as fine cracks formed across his body.

“Huangji Seal!” Luotian’s hands moved slightly, and the Huangji Seal fused instantly. He pushed it toward Shangguan Hongtu while his body halted and rushed forward again.

“Trivial tricks!” Shangguan Hongtu’s lips twitched upward, a mocking expression on his face. He felt how powerful he had become—stronger even than when he first entered the Ancient Immortal Ruins.

“I’ll crush you!” Luotian’s eyes flashed with cruelty. He activated the Fengtian Six Steps, charging at Shangguan Hongtu like a primordial beast with immense collision power.

“Since when did Daotian become this strong?” The offspring of eight elders stared at Luotian, who moved like a meteor. They looked at him as if they didn’t recognize him. Since Luotian’s last trial by thunder, they had noticed a change in Zhang Daotian.

As the elders pondered, Luotian and Shangguan Hongtu clashed again. With the Huangji Seal added, their power was evenly matched. They both shot apart and collided with several elders’ spontaneously arranged barriers.

Yet Luotian was more severely wounded, his bones cracked and his chest’s soul bone bearing thin cracks that made him agonize.

Compared to Luotian, Shangguan Hongtu fared much better—only a slight bloodstain on his lips and a pale face.

“Flesh-Annihilation Soul?” Shangguan Hongtu sneered. “Let’s see how you dodge my martial art!”

He quickly changed his hands, and waves of terrifying energy radiated from them. Luotian’s eyes narrowed.

Chapter 607: To Kill or Not to Kill

Chapter 607: To Kill or Not to Kill

“Martial art!” Luotian observed Shangguan Hongtu’s rapidly moving hands, his expression dark. A Soul-Annihilation Realm master’s martial art was beyond his current body’s strength to withstand.

Back then, Feiyan City Lord Taehong was only a single-element Soul-Annihilation Realm master, yet he had suffered considerable losses. Now Shangguan Hongtu possessed three elements—his strength was incomparable to Taehong’s.

A humming sound echoed from the sky. Under Shangguan Hongtu’s control, a brilliant light hand, a verdant hand, and a golden hand tore through the void, appearing before people’s eyes.

“An Earth-level High-Grade Martial Art!” The disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect gasped as three hands covered the sky.

“Marshall Xuexie is indeed a prodigy. If our sect had such talent, we would be invincible for tens of thousands of years. Regretfully…” Several elders sighed.

The Heavenly Dao Sect was powerful but lacked successors. Originally, Zhang Daotian had been a four-element prodigy, yet he was spoiled and never focused on cultivation.

“Xuan Guang Three Hands!” Shangguan Hongtu roared, and the three hands collided under his voice.

“Martial art fusion?” People’s faces showed shock as they watched the three-element hands colliding.

“Not quite. Martial art fusion combines two arts perfectly, but he’s generating immense power through continuous collisions!” A seal master elder murmured.

“Though not true fusion, its power is still immense. How will Daotian withstand it?” Several elders looked worried.

Zhang Daotian was a disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect. If he lost too badly, it would greatly affect the sect. In people’s eyes, Zhang Daotian had already achieved a miracle by matching Marshall Xuexie in body strength. To defeat him was impossible.

“Let me show you true martial art fusion!” Luotian’s lips curled. The Human King Seal and Soul-Stealing Seal appeared in the sky.

“Four-element Human King Seal is one level weaker than five-element,” Luotian sighed, observing the flowing four-element seal.

“Huangji Seal!” Luotian roared. Two seals converged under people’s astonished gazes.

Luotian had used the Huangji Seal before, but it was a hasty use with only one element and the Soul-Stealing Seal hadn’t been fully utilized. People had not paid much attention then.

But now, people stared in shock as the Huangji Seal slowly fused.

“This is true martial art fusion!” Situdchen’s eyes gleamed, his gaze filled with excitement as he watched Luotian standing there.

“Unexpectedly, someone can fuse martial arts!” Several elders were stunned, their eyes filled with disbelief as they watched the Huangji Seal forming.

“In my eyes, you’re just an ant!” Shangguan Hongtu’s face flickered with surprise before his lips curved. He slammed his hands into the void.

With Shangguan Hongtu’s action, thunderous sounds erupted. The three-color hands collided repeatedly, radiating terrifying waves and overwhelming pressure—leaving no room for resistance.

“Huangji Seal, go!” Luotian’s face turned wild. He pushed the Huangji Seal forward while his hands quickly changed.

“Kai Tian!” Suddenly, the void split open. The Kai Tian Seal emerged from the void.

“Two seals! I won’t let you get away with this!” Luotian roared. The Huangji Seal and Kai Tian Seal, accompanied by thunderous sounds, attacked Shangguan Hongtu’s hands.

“Crack…” The void shattered. The entire Heavenly Dao Mountain trembled under the three martial arts’ influence.

The collision of three martial arts generated powerful waves, which were gradually absorbed by the shattered void.

“Huff…” Luotian’s face turned pale. Using two martial arts so quickly was a great drain on him.

“Haha!” A cold laugh echoed. In an instant, Shangguan Hongtu vanished from his spot and appeared before Luotian. A fierce punch struck Luotian’s back.

At Shangguan Hongtu’s laugh, Luotian felt something was wrong. He suddenly recalled the strange movement of the Yamen Sect.

“Spit…!” A punch struck his back, causing Luotian’s face to flush red. Next moment, he spat blood and was sent flying, colliding with a massive barrier. Blood stained the barrier.

“How about it? Surrender!” Shangguan Hongtu laughed, his figure flashing again. A cold expression filled his face as he kicked toward Luotian’s face.

Shangguan Hongtu was excited. He had dreamed of this moment for a year, surviving nine deaths in the Yamen Sect’s trial to finally crush Luotian.

For years, Luotian had been his nightmare. Shangguan Hongtu never stopped thinking of revenge against Luotian. Today, his long-cherished dream had finally come true.

“First Soul!” But as Shangguan Hongtu flew, Luotian’s eyes narrowed. He suddenly opened them, like lightning in the night, piercing Shangguan Hongtu’s eyes. Shangguan Hongtu’s body paused.

As Luotian spoke, his aura surged to the heavens. His lips curled slightly, revealing endless coldness.

“Wanting to crush me? You’re still far from it! Second Soul!” Luotian stepped on the Fengtian Steps, roaring. His body emitted a series of cracks.

“Secret technique! What is this secret technique? I’ve never seen it!” Situdchen’s eyes flashed with intense light. He felt his disciple was hiding something.

“Third Soul… Fourth Soul… Seventh Soul…” Luotian didn’t hesitate. He activated the Burn-Soul Method, directly burning seven souls.

“Boom…” An invisible wave formed around Luotian. The ground beneath him couldn’t withstand the powerful impact, and stone blocks lifted one by one before floating in front of Luotian.

With seven souls activated, Luotian’s aura and cultivation soared. Finally, he reached the Soul-Annihilation Mid-phase.

“Do you think I should kill you or not?” Luotian smiled, his consciousness forming a voice in Shangguan Hongtu’s mind.

Chapter 608: Soul Extraction

Chapter 608: Soul Extraction

The disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect stared in awe at Luotian, now at the Soul-Annihilation Mid-phase. They couldn’t believe their eyes as they watched him standing proudly, albeit somewhat battered.

“Daotian’s a hidden gem!” The nine elders of the Heavenly Dao Sect, except Situdchen, wore expressions of admiration. They looked at Situdchen with envy.

“Situdchen, you and your disciple have hidden well. We almost fell for it!” Murong Cheng spoke with a smile.

At this moment, Zhang Daotian’s image had completely changed. He was now a genius hiding behind a spoiled exterior.

“Little bastard!” Situdchen’s face showed no emotion, but he mentally cursed. As Zhang Daotian’s master, he hadn’t known his disciple could have such a mindset.

Huang Xiande and two other elders of the Dark Palace watched Zhang Daotian’s overwhelming aura, their faces showing bitterness. They hadn’t expected the notorious Zhang Daotian of the Ancient Immortal Continent to turn into a genius.

“Damn! Soul-Annihilation Mid-phase!” Shangguan Hongtu gritted his teeth, his face dark as he watched Zhang Daotian walking toward him. He cursed inwardly.

In the Soul-Annihilation Realm, each minor phase difference was like a chasm. Without special methods, even a slight phase gap meant an insurmountable distance.

Though Shangguan Hongtu was self-confident, he was only at the Soul-Annihilation Initial phase. Against a regular Soul-Annihilation Mid-phase, he still had confidence to fight. But against Zhang Daotian, his confidence vanished instantly—this was the psychological shadow caused by being killed before. It could be called fear of Zhang Daotian.

For years, Shangguan Hongtu had lived under this shadow. Though he never admitted it outwardly, deep down, he still feared Zhang Daotian.

Zhang Daotian walked toward Shangguan Hongtu step by step. Though he seemed to have no pressure, each step made Shangguan Hongtu feel closer to death.

“Kill!” Under this overwhelming pressure, Shangguan Hongtu finally couldn’t control himself. His face turned wild as he felt if he didn’t act, he would lose his chance.

He punched forward. A void crack appeared before him. Without hesitation, Shangguan Hongtu dove into it and vanished from people’s sight.

“Does this Marshall Xuexie want to die? He dares to enter the void!” The disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect were shocked, watching Marshall Xuexie vanish into the void crack.

“Same old trick. You’ve made no progress in years!” Seeing Shangguan Hongtu enter the void, Luotian showed no tension.

After seven souls transformed into cultivation, Luotian had entered the Soul-Annihilation Mid-phase. A unprecedented strength made him confident he outclassed Shangguan Hongtu in all aspects.

“Yamen Killing!” A low roar echoed from the void. A black sword split the void, appearing behind Luotian.

“Beware!” Several elders were stunned. A Soul-Annihilation Realm master couldn’t escape this without notice.

The disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect felt nothing of Shangguan Hongtu’s presence. They only saw a void crack open, like an abyssal mouth ready to swallow Luotian.

“Hmph…” Luotian sneered. At the same time, he moved his feet slightly and shot a punch.

Miesheng Fist. With Luotian’s current state, it could cause significant damage to Shangguan Hongtu. He was certain even Shangguan Hongtu couldn’t withstand five punches.

Originally, Shangguan Hongtu had a fierce expression with bloodshot eyes. Luotian’s action startled him, but he was too late to retreat. His body flew like a meteor toward Luotian. The black sword passed by Luotian’s front, while Shangguan Hongtu himself collided with Luotian’s Miesheng Fist.

“Crack…”

Luotian’s fist and Shangguan Hongtu’s face collided. The face, which had been restored by the Dark Palace elders’ treatment, swelled again. Under people’s eyes, it lost infinite vitality.

Shangguan Hongtu came fast and left just as quickly. His body was sent flying into the void under Luotian’s punch.

“Fengtian Steps!” Luotian’s eyes flashed with coldness. He stepped into the void without hesitation, following Shangguan Hongtu’s figure.

“Master! Borrow the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword!” Luotian called to Situdchen, whose eyes were filled with excitement.

“Good!” Situdchen didn’t say a word. Under the eight elders’ twitching gazes, he tossed out the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword.

The clashing sound returned. The sword unsheathed on its way, thunderous sounds filled the air, lightning crossed the sky. The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword pierced through the barrier under the disciples’ reverent gaze and landed in Luotian’s hands.

“Boom…” As soon as Luotian held the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, he felt like holding a strand of lightning. His entire body echoed with thunderous sounds.

“Open…” Luotian held the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword and lightly slashed into the void. The sky was as fragile as paper under the sword’s power.

Without hesitation, Luotian rushed into the void with the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword. As soon as he entered, the sword radiated bright light, illuminating the black space. His vast spiritual sense spread out and found Shangguan Hongtu’s fleeing figure.

Kill intent flashed in Luotian’s eyes. He instantly appeared before Shangguan Hongtu, and a powerful suction force was exerted on his soul.

“Ah…” Shangguan Hongtu screamed. Under the suction force, his gray soul slowly exited his body.

“Rascals!” Huang Xiande stood on the sky, his face twisted with anger. He saw Luotian’s actions clearly—intending to kill Shangguan Hongtu.

“Reincarnation!” Luotian ignored him. The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword floated before him. One hand emitted suction force, while the other fist launched a Reincarnation Punch.

The Reincarnation Channel appeared in the black void, causing Shangguan Hongtu’s soul to panic.

With the Reincarnation Channel appearing, Shangguan Hongtu’s soul exited his body faster.

“Hmph!” A cold sound echoed through the void. A primordial energy hand rushed toward Luotian and slammed down.

Chapter 609: Cultivation Drop

Chapter 609: Cultivation Drop

Though the primordial energy hand was overwhelming, making Luotian feel that if it hit him, he would be shattered into pieces, it stopped at his head without continuing to descend.

“Huang Xiande!” Luotian was surprised. He sighed, acknowledging the strength of a Soul-Annihilation Realm master who could find him from outside the void and attack.

“Seems I can’t kill him!” Luotian sighed inwardly, his face showing disappointment. With Huang Xiande present, he couldn’t kill Shangguan Hongtu.

Moreover, the elders of the Heavenly Dao Sect wouldn’t allow him to kill Shangguan Hongtu. Luotian could see that Marshall Xuexie’s status in the Dark Palace was equivalent to his own position in the Heavenly Dao Sect. If he truly killed him, it would surely trigger a bloodbath between the two sects.

“But I can’t let him go either!” Luotian’s face showed cruelty. The Reincarnation Channel and suction force disappeared.

As the suction force vanished, Shangguan Hongtu’s soul slowly returned to his body. The primordial energy hand hovering above Luotian also gradually dissipated.

But in the next moment, Luotian suddenly grabbed the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword floating beside him and slashed toward Shangguan Hongtu’s soul.

“Ah…” A piercing scream echoed through the empty space again.

Lightning descended. Shangguan Hongtu’s soul, which hadn’t fully returned to his body and was only one-third exposed, was cut open by the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword.

“Suck…” Luotian’s hands emitted more suction force, drawing the one-third of Shangguan Hongtu’s soul into his hands. It turned into a gray mist.

Luotian didn’t hesitate. He took out a jade bottle, poured the gray mist into it, and sent seals with binding power to imprison Shangguan Hongtu’s fragmented soul inside the bottle.

This action made Huang Xiande furious. His face turned dark, his eyes filled with killing intent. He flicked his finger, sending a sword qi from his hand that sliced through the void and rushed toward Luotian.

“Die!” Originally calm, Situdchen’s face turned icy with killing intent. “Go…” Situdchen coldly sneered, and a thunderous sound erupted from his mouth. Just the word “go” carried heavenly authority, shattering the sword qi mid-flight.

“Huang Xiande, don’t be so bold!” Situdchen’s eyes were filled with killing intent. A wild aura rose from his body, surrounding a hundred miles and startling the elders.

“Situdchen!” Huang Xiande’s eyes showed surprise, looking at Situdchen who had always been low-key.

Situdchen was renowned in the Heavenly Dao Sect, but he rarely left. People on the Ancient Immortal Continent knew that Situdchen was the Dan Sect elder of the Heavenly Dao Sect, but few knew his true strength.

In Huang Xiande’s view, since Situdchen was the Dan Sect elder of the Heavenly Dao Sect, his strength wouldn’t be poor. But he didn’t think Situdchen was stronger than himself. In fact, Huang Xiande thought Situdchen was far inferior to him.

But now, Situdchen gave Huang Xiande a terrifying feeling. He felt like an ordinary person standing before a primordial beast.

“Situdchen has领悟ed a bit of chaos power!” Murong Cheng and others showed surprise, looking at Situdchen.

Chaos power was considered mysterious. A Soul-Annihilation Realm master who领悟ed a bit of it would be a qualitative leap, becoming a semi-Immortal Lord.

The Heavenly Dao Sect’s nine elders had only Murong Cheng, the first elder, who领悟ed a bit. The other eight were just Soul-Annihilation Realm masters.

A Soul-Annihilation Realm master was like an ant before one who had领悟ed chaos power.

At this moment, Situdchen terrified the three elders of the Dark Palace. His overwhelming aura pressed down on them.

“Come here!” A cold and authoritative voice echoed in Huang Xiande’s ears. In the next moment, his body was uncontrollably pulled toward Situdchen.

Huang Xiande felt fear. He sensed intense killing intent in Situdchen’s eyes. He wanted to struggle but his body felt like it wasn’t his own, landing in Situdchen’s hands.

Situdchen’s eyes flashed like lightning. He coldly spoke: “Huang, you shouldn’t have provoked me. But you shouldn’t have touched my disciple or harbored killing intent toward him! He is my Situdchen’s disciple, not someone from the Dark Palace who can touch him. Even if the first elder of the Dark Palace, Ximen Tu, came, he couldn’t save you!”

“Situdchen, don’t you fear a sect war?” Huang Xiande, though captured, was a Soul-Annihilation Realm master. He didn’t want to lose his composure.

“Threaten me? Huang, I’ll tell you. My lifespan is nearly over. You can try. If it comes to that, I’ll leave the Heavenly Dao Sect and go to your Dark Palace to challenge. I want to see how many people in your Dark Palace can stop me when I’m desperate!”

Situdchen coldly replied, his powerful aura echoing before everyone.

“Situdchen!” Murong Cheng and other elders felt a pang of sorrow. The nine elders of the Heavenly Dao Sect had guarded their sect for tens of thousands of years. Now, hearing Situdchen’s words, they all felt sorrow.

“Today, I’ll let you live. But I’ll take half your cultivation as compensation!” Situdchen ignored others and pointed three fingers at Huang Xiande.

Each time Situdchen’s finger fell, a gray aura emerged from his fingers and entered Huang Xiande’s dantian.

The gray aura looked thin, but it carried supreme power. As soon as it appeared, the world’s primordial energy surged violently, like a child finding its mother, rushing into Huang Xiande’s body.

Three fingers. Huang Xiande’s cultivation dropped from the Soul-Annihilation Realm peak to the mid-phase, each finger taking away one phase.

“This!” Huang Xiande’s face was extremely dark. He felt his cultivation drop and spat blood.

Chapter 610: Leaving in Disgrace

Chapter 610: Leaving in Disgrace

Everyone’s eyes were on Situdchen, who stood霸道ly. Their faces showed respect.

At this moment, Situdchen was the supreme ruler of the world, as if he could control others’ lives.

“Pang…” Situdchen then tossed the pale-faced Huang Xiande to two other elders of the Dark Palace who had come, his eyes coldly watching them.

White light gathered people’s attention on the other side of the sky. The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword cut through the void, and Luotian dragged a defeated Shangguan Hongtu out of the void. His face showed confusion.

“Speak up! How do you unlock their seals? Don’t speak, and you’ll die! Don’t think your Dark Palace backing gives you protection. I won’t hesitate to act against you. You should know my nature!” Luotian’s cold voice echoed in Shangguan Hongtu’s mind, making his pale face tremble.

His soul had been taken one-third by Luotian. Shangguan Hongtu felt unusually weak. Though his cultivation hadn’t dropped, he sensed his injuries wouldn’t recover quickly.

Looking up at Luotian’s cold gaze, he remembered the eyes that had killed him in the Five Elements Sect. The same eyes were back again.

Shangguan Hongtu was thoroughly terrified. He knew if he didn’t speak, Luotian would mercilessly kill him—this was his understanding of Luotian.

“Cough cough…” Shangguan Hongtu weakly took out a jade slip from his storage bag and handed it to Luotian.

“From now on, I’ll never provoke this ancestor again!” Shangguan Hongtu had made a vow in his heart. This time, he was truly terrified. Having died once before, Shangguan Hongtu cherished his life more than anyone else. The last time he had been saved by his elder, but in this Ancient Immortal Ruins, if he died, no one would collect his soul. How could he be reborn?

Luotian took the jade slip, knowing it was genuine from Shangguan Hongtu’s fear.

Like Situdchen, he casually tossed Shangguan Hongtu to the Dark Palace’s group. He walked respectfully toward Situdchen.

People saw Luotian’s action, their mouths twitching. They secretly sighed that this master and disciple were indeed alike—both so霸道.

“Go! Next time you come to the Heavenly Dao Sect, remember to wash your face. Attacking a junior like this really brings honor to your Dark Palace!” Situdchen sneered at Huang Xiande and others.

Hearing Situdchen’s words and the mockery on the Heavenly Dao Sect disciples’ faces, the Dark Palace felt bitter. They hadn’t expected to simply come to the Heavenly Dao Sect to show off, trying to use the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword as a bargaining chip for more treasures. But they ended up in this situation.

They hadn’t obtained any treasures, and had even lost the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword. Marshall Xuexie’s soul was cut one-third, and he wouldn’t recover quickly. The worst loss was Huang Xiande, whose cultivation had dropped to the Soul-Annihilation Mid-phase. This was a heavy loss for the Dark Palace.

No more words, the Dark Palace elders took Huang Xiande and his disciple, tore through the void, and left in disgrace.

“Huff…” Luotian sighed deeply after seeing the Dark Palace leave. His mood was great—he had found a way to unlock Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei’s seals. He also fulfilled his master Zhang Daotian’s wish.

After this day, Luotian was certain that Zhang Daotian’s name would rise in the Heavenly Dao Sect, replacing his spoiled reputation.

Indeed, people’s gazes toward Luotian had changed. Situdchen was in high spirits and laughed aloud: “From now on, who dares to say my disciple is a failure or a spoiled brat!”

Zheng Junfeng saw Luotian standing in the sky, his face showing emotion. His eyes were clear and confused, a painful expression on his face—but no one noticed this small change.

“Go…” Situdchen laughed and took Luotian back to his cave. People gradually dispersed, the square becoming empty again. Zheng Junfeng remained standing there with confusion.

……

“Hum…” The displacement power accompanied the primordial energy waves. Luotian and Situdchen landed in Situdchen’s cave.

As soon as they arrived, Luotian’s aura rapidly dropped. Finally, under Situdchen’s surprised gaze, he turned into an ordinary person.

“Speak up! Where did you get all these techniques?” Situdchen’s face showed joy. He didn’t doubt Luotian’s identity, certain that the person before him was indeed Zhang Daotian and hadn’t been possessed.

“Master, can you keep it a secret?” Luotian smiled, speaking to Situdchen.

“Get out!” Situdchen was about to kick Luotian out but suddenly remembered Zhang Daotian’s current state—just an ordinary person. He withdrew his foot.

“Stay here for these days. Don’t go out. Anyone can kill you now!” Situdchen showed concern, speaking to Luotian.

“Ugh…” Luotian inwardly rolled his eyes. He couldn’t sit still here for days.

“Master, with you around, I won’t have any problems in the Heavenly Dao Sect. Also, your conditions are too poor. I’m not saying this to you, master. You’re the Dan Sect elder of the Heavenly Dao Sect, but your accommodation is no better than an outer disciple. Should I have someone fix it tomorrow? Also, when will you get me my nine-star elixirs and top-tier treasures? The Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword is good, I use it well. Master…”

Luotian quickly spoke, his words like a continuous barrage that left Situdchen stunned.

“Get out of my way!” Situdchen felt his ears were like a fly, shouting at Luotian. He waved his hand and displaced Luotian to the outside of his original residence.

After displacing Luotian, Situdchen wore a thinking expression. He murmured: “I really need to give this kid some life-saving things!”

“Huff…” Luotian sighed deeply, thinking he was lucky to have stayed with Zheng Xin for so long. His speech speed was unmatched.

He instructed the Yuanling-level servants to get him some food and then comfortably lay on his soft bed.

“His power was so overwhelming! But for forty-nine days, how can I survive as an ordinary person?” Luotian sighed bitterly.

“Zhang… Dao… Tian… Come out, you bastard!” Just as Luotian had lain down for a moment, an angry voice echoed outside.

From now on, there will be two updates daily. The stock is insufficient, so I can’t make it to the recommendation list. The爆发 will be delayed a bit. Sorry, everyone.

Chapter 611: Marriage Proposal

Chapter 611: Marriage Proposal

Hearing this voice, Luotian’s eyebrows slightly furrowed. This voice was familiar but he couldn’t recall who it was.

“Damn, I’ll see who dares to talk to me like this now!” Luotian got up and walked outside.

“Pang…” As soon as he stepped out, he saw his door had been smashed off by someone. Several Yuanling-level servants watched the门口 carefully.

“Damn! I’m not here!” Luotian shouted at the servants and then walked back into his room.

“This kid must have regained consciousness!” Luotian thought inwardly, his lips twitching. He remembered Zheng Xin’s previous encounter with himself when he had scared her to her knees.

“Zhang Daotian! You bastard, come out!” Zheng Xin stood at the door of Luotian’s house and cursed loudly.

“Can’t go out. My current state can’t fight him!” Luotian lay on his soft bed, waiting for Zheng Xin to leave before going out.

But Luotian had underestimated Zheng Xin’s combat power. She cursed from noon until night, like a fly.

“Ah…” Luotian yawned and opened his drowsy eyes. He looked outside at the darkening sky, still hearing Zheng Xin’s voice.

“Damn! No end!” Luotian showed helplessness and had to grit his teeth, stepping out of the room. He saw a crowd had gathered at the door, pointing and commenting on Zheng Xin.

“Who is this guy? Daring to curse Zhang Daotian, the little ancestor!”
“Doesn’t he know he’s risking his life?” People murmured, watching Zheng Xin curse at the door. Their faces showed shock. For years, no one had dared to curse Zhang Daotian at his door.

More astonishingly, the little ancestor Zhang Daotian had no response. He seemed to be avoiding it. The servants were on high alert, blocking Zheng Xin at the door.

As people gathered more, Fengzong’s name, Zheng Junfeng, gradually spread. This was the person who dared to curse Zhang Daotian.

“Let him in!” Luotian sighed, patting his forehead. He told the servants at the door.

“Yes!” Hearing Luotian’s words, the servants sighed in relief. They had been the most tormented all afternoon. Now that Luotian spoke, they let Zheng Xin in.

“Hmph…” Zheng Xin sneered and rushed through the door like a breeze.

“Ugh… Luotian! You bastard, you made me kneel for you. You…” Zheng Xin kicked the door open and cursed immediately but stopped instantly, stunned by the luxury before her.

“Cough cough… You’re awake!” Luotian walked toward Zheng Xin and gently patted her shoulder.

“Get out… You made me kneel for you!” Zheng Xin pushed Luotian’s hand away and regained her composure, ready to curse again.

But in the next moment, Luotian was sent flying backward and collided with a wall.

“Cough cough…” Luotian spat blood, his face pale.

“Damn! You want to kill me!” Luotian shouted at Zheng Xin.

“You didn’t use strength. What’s your condition? Why are you so weak?” Zheng Xin asked, no longer cursing but showing concern.
