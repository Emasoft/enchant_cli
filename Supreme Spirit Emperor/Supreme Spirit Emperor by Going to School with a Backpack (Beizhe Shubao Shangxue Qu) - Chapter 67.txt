Luo Tian exhaled softly, his heart eased. He calculated the time remaining—about half a bell. A light smile spread across his face: "It's rare to come out, brother will take you for a tour later. How about that?"

The others stared in terror at the two oddities, the tall and small one. They dared not speak. Su Yewu's eyes gleamed with inner light, lost in thought.

Luo Tian stepped toward Dong Xingjian, a smile on his face. At this moment, Dong Xingjian was at the brink of weakness after his Longxuan Sword had been shattered. His face brimmed with resentment as he glared at Luo Tian.

"I almost forgot, there's still one leg left to break!" Luo Tian crouched down and gently patted Dong Xingjian's handsome face.

"My father won't... let you live!" Dong Xingjian spoke weakly.

"Crack..." A crisp sound echoed, like a giant hammer striking deep into people's hearts. Luo Tian's heavy foot pressed firmly onto Dong Xingjian's right leg.

But just as Luo Tian lifted his thigh, a green long sword sliced through the air and plunged into the spot where he had stood.

"Bone-Devouring Peak!" Luo Tian's figure appeared before Long Baobao, his eyes grave as he gazed at the several middle-aged men not far away.

A golden figure flickered, like a meteor, and arrived before Dong Xingjian. His face was cold.

"Jian'er!" Dong Zimmo stared at his severely wounded son, a look of anxiety on his face. His gaze swept over the broken Longxuan Sword.

As Dong Xingjian's father, he knew well that his son had carved the Yuan Bone onto the Longxuan Sword. Now that the sword was broken, his son had clearly suffered heavy injuries.

"Father... avenge me!" Dong Xingjian's face bore endless resentment as he gazed at Luo Tian.

A pill fell into Dong Zimmo's hand and was placed into his son's mouth. While secretly lamenting Luo Tian's strength, Dong Zimmo's face turned icy. The temperature of the entire city lord's mansion seemed to drop sharply: "Ding Xiong, it's not that I don't give you face. Today, no matter who this kid is, he must pay the price!"

Ding Yuanshan and others followed closely. Seeing Dong Xingjian lying injured on the ground, their faces showed shock. They gazed at Luo Tian standing proudly and felt disbelief.

They knew Dong Xingjian's strength. To have reduced him to such a state, this youth was comparable to a sect disciple.

"Bone-Devouring Mid-phase! Indeed, it's the prodigy of Yuling Sect!" Ding Yuanshan sighed inwardly while his lips twitched. He approached his daughter, Ding Xiaoyan, and found she was not severely injured. His face eased somewhat.

"Dad, I want him dead!" Ding Xiaoyan's face bore a sinister expression as she gazed at Luo Tian.

"Rascal! You must have sent people to trouble him, right? I warned you not to bother him. You didn't listen. Now you've suffered a loss and want to blame your father?" Ding Yuanshan's face turned furious as he barked.

"Kid, you're dead!" Dong Zimmo's face bore cold killing intent as he pulled his sword from the ground and spoke coldly.

"Then see if you have the ability!" Long Letian's spear was shouldered, his eyes filled with gravity. This was his first encounter with a Bone-Devouring Peak powerhouse.

"Let it be exposed!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. Facing a Bone-Devouring Peak powerhouse, he had no chance of victory. Even if all his secrets were revealed, it was uncertain whether he could defeat him. This was considering Long Baobao's help as well. Alone, he would have to flee—though even that was uncertain.

"Brave!" Dong Zimmo's eyes showed a flicker of admiration.

"But you still must die!" His tone shifted, and Dong Zimmo's figure flickered. The aura of Bone-Devouring Peak surged like a golden lightning bolt, and his sword sliced through the void toward Luo Tian.

"Don't hurt my brother!" Long Baobao's innocent face lost its innocence. Her feet pushed off the ground, and cracks spread under her steps. Her white fists glowed with golden light as they clashed against the sword.

"Boom..." The collision echoed. Long Baobao's small body flew backward and collided into Luo Tian's arms.

"Ouch... it hurts!" Long Baobao gritted her teeth and cried out.

"Wow... this kid is only a few years old, yet he withstood a Bone-Devouring Peak strike! And he's unharmed!" Ding Yuanshan and others showed shock, gazing at Long Baobao.

"Is he really just a child? I feel like I've wasted my years!" Huo Zhiyong's face was bitter as he gazed at Long Baobao.

The other young people also wore bitter expressions. They had thought that among the youths of this Eastern Region, aside from those sect disciples, they were the strongest.

Even among those sect disciples, they had some resentment, believing it was merely because of their birth in the sect. Given the same conditions, they were confident they could be better than those sect disciples.

But today, Luo Tian and Long Baobao had completely crushed their arrogance. Facing a Bone-Devouring Peak powerhouse, they dared to fight back—something they couldn't do.

"Dong Xiong, stop! Don't bring great calamity upon your family!" Ding Yuanshan's face was anxious as he stood before Luo Tian. He couldn't let Luo Tian be harmed. Seeing Dong Zimmo's stance earlier, it was clear he wanted Luo Tian dead.

"Dad, why do you always protect this guy?" Ding Xiaoyan's face bore madness as she gazed at her father, unable to fathom who could make her father act this way.

"Ding Xiong, it's not that I don't give you face. Your daughter was also injured by this kid. Can you bear it? Who is this kid, that you protect him so much? If you don't clarify today, I won't recognize you!" Dong Zimmo stood with his sword, his face filled with endless authority as he demanded.

He was also puzzled. He hadn't expected Ding Yuanshan to risk a fight with him just to protect this youth. That made Dong Zimmo think deeply.

"Ha! You, Dong, if you dare to attack me, I'll kill your useless son! Do you believe it?" Luo Tian's face bore a sneer. His eyes caught sight of the half-dead Dong Xingjian lying there.

"You!" Dong Zimmo's face turned furious upon hearing Luo Tian's words. Though he had the upper hand in their previous clash,

that formidable little boy could still block him. If Luo Tian seized this opportunity to kill Dong Xingjian, it was possible. And seeing Ding Yuanshan's situation clearly showed he wanted to protect this kid.

Chapter 329: Five Cities ()

Chapter 329: Five Cities

"Ding Yuanshan, are you really going to tear us apart over this kid?" Dong Zimmo's face showed a flicker of hesitation as he asked.

"Lao Dong, believe me, you really can't touch this kid! If you do, it will bring great trouble!" Ding Yuanshan loudly refused, pretending to be concerned for Dong Zimmo.

Though the relationships among the five cities weren't particularly good, they were also not bad. Their surface relations remained quite good.

Dong Zimmo's face hesitated as he looked at the other city lords, clearly not wanting to get involved. He wore an indifferent expression.

"No, tell us his identity. Otherwise, even if you block me, I'll make him pay the price!" Dong Zimmo gazed at his severely wounded son, a look of pain on his face. He revealed his final card.

The other city lords and youths also gazed curiously at Ding Yuanshan, their faces showing confusion. They didn't understand why Ding Yuanshan was so protective of Luo Tian.

"Alright, now that it's come to this, I can only tell you. He is a disciple of Yuling Sect. Now do you understand why I protect him? If anything happens to him, even we who are unrelated will face Yuling Sect's wrath!" Ding Yuanshan looked at everyone with a helpless expression.

"Yuling Sect!" The five city lords exclaimed in surprise, their faces filled with disbelief.

Yuling Sect was an emperor-like presence in the Eastern Region. It was like Wuxing Sect's position in the Northern Region, but even higher. It was one of the few major sects in the Eastern Region.

"Old fox!" The other city lords thought coldly. If Ding Yuanshan had told Dong Zimmo earlier, Dong Zimmo wouldn't have acted.

But now he had told Dong Zimmo. Previously, Dong Zimmo had already offended Luo Tian. Now, if he revealed Luo Tian's identity, his actions would win Luo Tian's favor.

Though the five city lords had some background and connections with sects in the Eastern Region, their sects were still inferior to Yuling Sect.

The Dong family's background was rumored to be connected with the first-tier sect, Tianjian Sect. But even Tianjian Sect was slightly inferior to Yuling Sect.

At this moment, if Luo Tian were just an ordinary disciple, even if Dong Zimmo killed or crippled him, with the Dong family's background, they could easily settle this matter by paying a price.

But now, even the blind could see Luo Tian was no ordinary person. Even among major sects, he was a prodigy. If they moved against him, the entire Dong family would suffer.

"Crack!" Dong Zimmo's face showed intense inner struggle. His hand clutched the sword tightly, his eyes fixed on Luo Tian.

"Hmph!" Luo Tian's face showed indifference. His heart, however, was drumming. After the previous commotion, his time with the Nai Pian Dragon Seal had run out. He hoped Dong Xingjian had some sense; otherwise, he would have to fight to the end.

"Fine! Yuling Sect, I, Dong Zimmo, can't afford to provoke. Today's matter ends here!" Dong Zimmo spoke as if pulling the words from his teeth. He seemed to have aged years in an instant, and he approached Dong Xingjian.

"Ah..." Hearing Dong Zimmo's words, the city lords including Ding Yuanshan all exhaled softly, their faces showing relief.

After Ding Yuanshan's introduction, their gaze toward Luo Tian changed, and they wore warm smiles.

"Ah, he's a disciple of Yuling Sect! No wonder he's so变态!" Huo Zhiyong and his brother Huo Zhiwu sighed softly, feeling somewhat better.

Su Yewu's face gleamed with inner light as she gazed at Luo Tian, her eyes showing a strange expression.

Ding Xiaoyan's face bore resentment and didn't show the same feelings as others, a sense of humiliation making her extremely angry.

As she watched Dong Zimmo carry Dong Xingjian away, Luo Tian sighed deeply in relief. He thought: "It's still better to be under a big tree! If I weren't pretending to be a Yuling Sect disciple, I would have had to fight to the end today!"

"Little brother, my name is Huo Chengye. I'm the lord of Ronghuo City. If you have time, come visit my Ronghuo City!" A middle-aged man with a thick beard greeted Luo Tian cheerfully.

"I am Su Anran, the lord of Tuyuan City. Little brother, come visit my Tuyuan City often. Yewu, you should get to know Luo Xiao Xiong more closely!" Su Anran smiled at Su Yewu.

"Luo Xiong, please guide me often!" Su Yewu spoke with a seductive tone.

"Uh... that's fine, that's fine!" Luo Tian rubbed his nose awkwardly.

"Old Su, you're so quick to marry off your daughter! My Cold Fei hasn't even married yet. How about we discuss it?" A middle-aged man in blue clothes smiled and teased Su Anran.

Upon hearing their conversation, Ding Yuanshan's face showed a moment of thought as he gazed at Ding Xiaoyan.

Seeing his father's deep gaze and recalling the previous jests, Ding Xiaoyan knew what her father meant. She snorted: "Dream on!"

Ding Yuanshan sighed and patted his forehead: "Alright, everyone stop standing here. The servants have prepared the food and wine. Let's eat and chat later!"

"Buzz..." A fluctuation spread, and Luo Tian's cultivation returned to the ninth level of Body Tempering. Long Baobao's figure vanished from sight, leaving only a trail of golden light.

Seeing that Luo Tian had seals on him, the others were more convinced he was a disciple of Yuling Sect.

After all, Yuling Sect's sealing techniques were renowned far and wide. They didn't believe anyone else could perform such an extraordinary seal, capable of sealing a Bone-Devouring level into the ninth level of Body Tempering.

Under the enthusiastic invitations, Luo Tian had no choice but to follow them for a meal. The atmosphere at the banquet was very harmonious, except for the Dong family's father and son who didn't come.

During the banquet, Luo Tian gathered a lot of useful information, such as the names of these five cities. The Dong family's city was called Lianjin City, the Cold family's was Qingmu City, the Ding family's was Lishui City, the Fire family's was Ronghuo City, and the Su family's was Tuyuan City. These names subtly connected with the Five Elements.

But Luo Tian wasn't curious about these; he was more interested in how these five cities' names were similar to the Five Peaks of the Five Elements.

Whether the five cities had any connection with the Five Elements remained unknown to Luo Tian. The city lords said these names had existed since long ago, and no matter which family became the lord of the city, they never changed these five major cities' names.

Chapter 330: Journey to Kunlun Mountain ()

Chapter 330: Journey to Kunlun Mountain

Luo Tian couldn't figure out the connection between these five cities and the Five Elements Sect, so he gave up thinking. The city lords had already warmly welcomed him with wine.

Luo Tian rarely spoke, and when asked about Yuling Sect, he simply smiled past it. He was afraid they would discover he was a fake disciple, which would make things complicated.

After the banquet, servants removed the tableware and brought out tea sets. The five city lords sat in their respective positions, but Luo Tian was uncomfortable as Ding Yuanshan placed him at the head position while others sat below.

After much reluctance, Luo Tian had to sit there awkwardly, watching the city lords talk.

"Lao Ding, it's the first time in years that we didn't fight for this spot!" Su Anran spoke, his face filled with deep nostalgia.

"Indeed! I don't know what changes the sects have undergone, but now five families can enter together for trade!" Cold Qingfeng smiled.

"That's great! If five of us go in together, it means each family gets an extra spot. Let the young people go together!" Ding Yuanshan was clearly excited, thinking about the news he received yesterday.

Yesterday, after arranging Luo Tian, Ding Yuanshan had received a message that this year's trade with the sects changed from one family to five. He was so excited he couldn't sleep for half the night.

In fact, what these city lords cared about wasn't the annual trade with the sects but another matter: every three years, the sects' recruitment day was held at this time.

As the strongest five cities outside the sects, these sects naturally gave them opportunities. It was decided that those who went for trade could also participate in the sects' recruitment.

Previously, only one person from these five cities was selected each year—the strongest youth among the five cities. For example, three years ago, it was Dong Xingxie, Dong Xingjian's older brother. Others had to wait for the next chance.

This year, each family had one spot—meaning these young people all had a chance to enter the sects.

After their disciples entered the sects, these city lords felt more secure.

The young people naturally heard about this and wore faint excitement on their faces. Being able to enter a sect would greatly enhance their strength.

Luo Tian understood this from their conversation and wore an enlightened expression, speaking softly: "Respected elders, I also plan to return to the sect. If convenient, I can go with you all."

"Haha, Luo Xiong is too polite. Entering Kunlun Mountain, I hope you'll look after our unqualified children!" Su Anran smiled and said loudly.

Upon hearing Su Anran's words, the other city lords also showed understanding, exchanging greetings. They thought Luo Tian must be of high status in Yuling Sect. If they could get his help, it would definitely benefit their children.

"Of course! I will certainly look after them a little!" Luo Tian smiled, but his heart was twitching. He thought: "I just wanted to sneak in! Who knows who will look after whom!"

Under the pleasant atmosphere, everyone returned to their respective accommodations.

From the start of the banquet, Ding Xiaoyan had been frowning, watching Luo Tian and the five city lords happily chatting. When they were halfway through the meal, she left angrily.

Luo Tian returned to his accommodation and patted his stiffly smiling face, taking a deep breath. His eyes turned profound: "Finally, I'm going to that legendary place where sects gather!"

...

Three days passed. During these three days, Luo Tian hadn't stepped out of his room at all. He was only invited once by Huo Zhiyong and Huo Zhiwu to a small gathering with the young people. To his surprise, Dong Xingjian and Ding Xiaoyan also attended, and Dong Xingjian even showed a friendly attitude toward him, as if wanting to turn swords into plowshares.

Luo Tian was puzzled by Dong Xingjian's sudden change of attitude but knew they wouldn't give up so easily. He simply smiled and acted as if a great person doesn't hold grudges against small people.

He stretched his body lightly, smiled, and placed a jade slip into his storage ring while murmuring: "This Flame-Devouring Fire Array is indeed mysterious. It's worth it being a level one technique. Compared to the Soul-Stealing Seal, it's much stronger! In three days, I've only grasped the basics. Well, if I can master it on the way, it'll be another secret weapon when I reach Kunlun Mountain!"

He adjusted his clothes and walked toward the main gate of Ding's mansion. He saw the five city lords already waiting at the entrance for Luo Tian and the other youths.

"Sorry, I kept you all waiting!" Luo Tian bowed respectfully, smiling.

"Where's the problem? We arrived early!" Huo Chengye laughed and replied.

"When do we depart?" Luo Tian looked puzzled, noticing that the other city lords and their children had already arrived. Only Dong Zimmo and his son were missing. He asked softly:

"Haha, sorry for keeping you waiting!" Dong Zimmo's voice echoed. He and Dong Xingjian walked over from the distance.

Although they had rested for three days, Dong Xingjian's arms and legs were already reattached. However, the injury from losing his Yuan Bone hadn't recovered so quickly. But to Luo Tian's eyes, Dong Xingjian looked much better than before when they met.

Dong Xingjian smiled and greeted Luo Tian and others, his eyes no longer showing the previous resentment.

"Since everyone has arrived, you should depart now. Remember to listen to Luo Tian in Kunlun Mountain!" The city lords gave final instructions again.

As the strongest cities outside the sects in the Eastern Region, they didn't have flying beasts like Long Dragon. But they could still afford a spacious carriage.

"Roar..." A fierce beast's roar echoed from the distance.

Luo Tian looked up, his eyes slightly tightening. A beast several zhang long and massive walked over from the distance.

It had two fierce horns on its head, making people shiver. Its head resembled a dragon, but its thick limbs were like a horse—though much larger than a horse. Its back pulled something like a carriage, and it radiated a calm aura.

"Luo Xiong, our city isn't as good as the sects. We can only have this dragon horse to pull the carriage. Please bear with it!" Ding Yuanshan smiled and spoke to Luo Tian.

Chapter 331: Journey ()

Chapter 331: Journey

"Ding Elder, you're too kind!" Although Ding Yuanshan had asked Luo Tian to call him "Uncle Ding" several times, Luo Tian thought about it. Since he was in front of so many people, and Ding Yuanshan was a city lord, he had to maintain face.

"Alright, you all get in!" Ding Yuanshan smiled and told the young people.

Six people sat in the carriage, while Huo Zhiwu stayed behind because he was one year younger than Huo Zhiyong. He still had a chance later.

Though it was called a carriage, its space was much larger than the rooms Luo Tian had lived in before. Six people sitting inside didn't feel crowded.

The beast pulling the carriage was called a Dragon Horse, very docile and intelligent. Its strength equaled that of a human at the ninth level of Body Tempering. It often transported people to Kunlun Mountain and was familiar with the route, needing no management. It smoothly traveled on the road.

"Luo大哥, when you get to Kunlun Mountain, please take care of me!" As soon as they entered the carriage, Su Yewu sat in front of Luo Tian and leaned closer. Her body exuded a seductive aura, her breath like a gentle breeze on Luo Tian's face.

"Ah... take care! Take care!" Luo Tian's face showed awkwardness, and he pushed Su Yewu aside absentmindedly.

"Haha, Luo Xiong, don't be afraid. Yewu is like this. The more you avoid her, the more she takes advantage!" Huo Zhiyong smiled, surprised that even a monster like Luo Tian could show shyness.

"Hmph!" Ding Xiaoyan looked coldly at Luo Tian and Su Yewu, sneering. She sat beside Dong Xingjian.

"Dong Ge, how's your injury?" Ding Xiaoyan showed concern and asked softly.

"Nothing serious. I think it'll heal by the time we reach Kunlun Mountain!" Dong Xingjian's eyes showed a smile as he gazed at Luo Tian, making Luo Tian glance at him.

Their eyes met in the air. Dong Xingjian's face showed a friendly expression, but Luo Tian felt an inexplicable sense of danger.

"Hope you don't go too far," Luo Tian thought coldly, smiling slightly and then closed his eyes to rest.

"Although this journey won't expose me, I'll definitely be exposed when I reach Kunlun Mountain. I don't even know where Kunlun Mountain is!" He closed his eyes and thought about how to enter Kunlun Mountain. Obviously, going in with these people was absolutely impossible.

After thinking for a while, he still couldn't find an answer. He sighed inwardly: "Well, when it's time, I'll just make an excuse to leave. Then I'll figure out how to get in."

Two days passed quickly, and the six of them walked two days under a surface harmony.

"Let's go out for a walk. Once we enter Kunlun Mountain, I don't know when we'll come out. My father said it's a separate small world, and the entrance and exit are very complicated," Huo Zhiyong said.

Everyone nodded in agreement, finding it annoying to stay inside the carriage all the time.

Luo Tian opened his eyes and nodded slightly, following everyone out of the carriage. The group walked forward slowly, and a high cliff appeared before them.

"Ah... it's already at Duanyouya? There should be two more days until Kunlun Mountain. This Dragon Horse's speed is really impressive!" Huo Zhiyong looked at the high cliff and sighed.

"Roar..." The Dragon Horse showed a human-like pride on its face, following the group.

"Hey... it can even understand me!" Huo Zhiyong smiled and stroked the Dragon Horse's head.

Dong Xingjian's complexion had clearly improved over these two days, his injuries mostly healed with the help of pills. He looked at the high Duanyou Cliff with a sense of excitement, glancing at Luo Tian and showing a fleeting cold light in his eyes.

...

On the high peak of Duanyou Cliff, four young men stood proudly, their faces cold. They wore black veils covering their faces, eyes sharp and cold as they gazed at the six people chatting below.

"I didn't expect that Yumen Sect only sent two young men. I wonder if they're capable!" A black-cloaked man's eyes flashed like lightning, gazing at the two veiled young men sitting opposite.

"Don't be foolish. These two aren't ordinary people. It's said they caused a storm in Yumen Sect right after joining. They've never failed when they fought! So we can rest easy!" The man standing beside him, also veiled, looked at the two young men with a strong sense of fear.

"This time is mainly about secrecy. If it's exposed, we'll all have no good outcome. That kid is a disciple of Yuling Sect. If even a hint of his identity is leaked, even if we die, the sect will be affected!" The man who spoke first said solemnly.

"Thank you for your help, Wang Ge!" The man behind him respectfully spoke.

"If it weren't for your conditions being too tempting, I wouldn't have taken this risk. This is about life and death!" He sneered and said no more.

"Sister, we seem to be looked down upon," a young man in a veil spoke softly to the girl beside him.

"Looked down upon? Let's just finish the mission and go back to cultivate. We're still weak now. At least we need to reach Yuanling Phase before we can rescue our mother from that cold place!" The girl's face showed a hint of illness.

Hearing the mention of her mother, the man's body trembled and his eyes showed determination.

"They're coming!" The girl spoke, her gaze filled with confusion as she looked at the six people below. When her eyes fell on Luo Tian, a strange familiarity stirred in her heart.

"Two of you, remember to take the kid's life. Others can be spared without revealing your identities!" The black-cloaked man pointed at Luo Tian's figure.

"Okay," the black-cloaked woman nodded, pushing away that strange feeling in her mind.

"Alright, let's fight!" The black-cloaked man spoke and jumped down from the height like a hunting eagle.

Upon seeing the black-cloaked man jump, the other three followed behind and dove down.

At this moment, Luo Tian and the others were walking at the base of the mountain. The atmosphere was very harmonious, and Luo Tian walked forward confidently. But after taking a single step, he suddenly looked up, his expression turning grave.

"Get out of the way!" Luo Tian's figure flickered and vanished from his spot.

The others heard Luo Tian's words and didn't hesitate, vanishing like agile leopards.

"Boom..." Four heavy thuds echoed in the ears of those who had just escaped.

Four black figures, like four spears, plunged into the ground with powerful auras radiating from them. The cold killing intent was like an actual mist, surrounding the six people who had hidden.

Luo Tian felt this cold killing intent and was startled, his face showing gravity.

"Three Bone-Devouring Mid-phase, one Bone-Devouring Late-phase!" Huo Zhiyong exclaimed in shock, his face filled with strong amazement.

"Who are you?" Ding Xiaoyan stared at the four black-cloaked people, her voice filled with questioning.

"Your reaction is good! We're the ones who want your lives!" A cold voice came from the black-cloaked man in the Bone-Devouring Late-phase.

"Who do you think you are to kill us?" Su Yewu's face showed disbelief as she gazed at the four black-cloaked people.

They were all children of city lords, and in this world where sects rarely appeared, their status was extremely high. No one dared to attack them.

"Kill!" The answer to Su Yewu was only a cold word.

Although they were four people, the group had more numbers and could fight to the end. Luo Tian saw their obvious killing intent but couldn't determine if they were after him or these city lords' disciples.

"But I have no combat power now. My injuries haven't healed yet!" Dong Xingjian looked innocent, gazing at everyone.

"I'll take care of Dong Ge!" Ding Xiaoyan's face showed a fierce expression, standing beside Dong Xingjian with her twin whips in hand. Her eyes were cautious as she watched the four people rushing toward them.

"Let's try! If it doesn't work, at least we can escape and report back!" Huo Zhiyong shouted loudly. His fire attribute Yuan Qi surged, showing some confidence. He had fought a Bone-Devouring Mid-phase powerhouse before and although he lost, it wasn't too bad.

The others' situations were similar, but Luo Tian was awkwardly in a difficult position. He was just a ninth-level Body Tempering youth, how could he fight against a Bone-Devouring Late-phase powerhouse?

The group clearly saw Luo Tian as their strongest and assigned the Bone-Devouring Mid-phase powerhouse to him.

Luo Tian's lips slightly lifted, a humming sound rang out, and his spear appeared in his hand. His face showed hesitation as he rushed toward the Bone-Devouring Late-phase powerhouse.

"Crack Heaven's Spear!" As Luo Tian ran, two of the four people stopped abruptly. Their voices carried surprise as they gazed at Luo Tian's spear.

"Say, where did you get this Crack Heaven's Spear? Where is its master?" A cold voice came from the woman among the four.

Seeing the woman stop, the two men behind her looked at the target man with confusion.

"Say... where did you get this spear? If you don't tell us, I'll skin your hide today!" The man beside the woman's body trembled and his voice carried cold killing intent as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"Boom..." Upon hearing the two voices, Luo Tian was stunned and stood there in shock. His mind buzzed, and his running body felt like struck by lightning. His spear slipped from his hand and fell to the ground with a crisp sound.

"You... you..." Luo Tian choked, trying to speak but couldn't. His mind echoed with the two cold voices.

These two voices were familiar to Luo Tian, even though it had been nearly two years. These voices remained etched in his memory and would never be forgotten.

"Say! Where is its master!" The woman's body trembled and she shouted loudly.

"I... I am the master of this spear!" Luo Tian's eyes blurred, and two tears flowed from his corners.

"You... you..." The man shouted loudly but didn't finish the word, feeling something was wrong. He sensed this voice was familiar and was thinking when the woman rushed toward Luo Tian like a black whirlwind.

Everyone looked at the veiled woman with confusion.

"Be careful!" Huo Zhiyong and others shouted, warning Luo Tian.

Seeing the black-cloaked woman rushing toward Luo Tian, Dong Xingjian's face showed joy. He knew these four people well because it was all his arrangement. One of the four black-cloaked people was his brother, and the remaining three he guessed were help from his brother.

"Dong Ge, do you know these people?" Ding Xiaoyan noticed the flicker of joy in Dong Xingjian's eyes and used her mental imprint to enter his mind.

Upon hearing Ding Xiaoyan's telepathic message, Dong Xingjian's body trembled. His face was grim as he looked at Ding Xiaoyan, who was scrutinizing him with a questioning gaze.

"Yes, I know them. I didn't tell you before because I was afraid the news would leak out. You know, killing a disciple of Yuling Sect is a crime we can't bear. But if you offend me, Dong Xingjian, no matter who it is, they must die!" Dong Xingjian's voice carried a touch of madness.

Ding Xiaoyan remained silent, saying nothing. She felt that the Dong Xingjian before her had changed into a different person. He was no longer the elegant and outstanding Dong Xingjian but more like a despicable petty person.

She also hated Luo Tian, but she had never thought of sending others to assassinate him. The previous time when her father was supposed to kill Luo Tian, it had been a momentary outburst. She, Ding Xiaoyan, was also a dual-element genius with her own pride. She had decided to defeat Luo Tian openly and have him kneel at her feet.

While they were exchanging thoughts, the distance between Luo Tian and the black-cloaked woman was getting closer.

"Ten zhang... eight zhang... two zhang..."

"It's over!" Seeing their close distance, Luo Tian stood there in a daze. His face showed a gentle expression. At this moment, if the woman attacked him, even gods couldn't save him.

But soon everyone's eyes widened in disbelief, their jaws nearly dropping.

The woman who had previously threatened to kill Luo Tian now rushed into his arms like a little swallow.

"What the hell is this?" Huo Zhiyong rubbed his eyes and instinctively shouted.

The two black-cloaked men, the Bone-Devouring Late-phase and Mid-phase, also shouted in their minds: "We want to know what this is! This is the killer we hired!"

"Ha... brother!" The woman's companion's eyes were also filled with tears. He knew that the only person who could be so close to his older sister was one person—Luo Tian!
