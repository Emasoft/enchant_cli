“Once I traversed this sea of fire, but at that time I must have been fortunate to enter the Fire Domain without encountering any peril. We can try again—my memory of the path I took before remains, and with our combined strength and hidden cards, we should be able to manage it!” Luotian’s face bore a solemn expression as he gazed upon the familiar flames, speaking softly.

“Let’s go back—this path is bound to cause trouble. We’ll proceed carefully; it shouldn’t be a problem!” Jiang Nanxuan concurred with Luotian’s assessment. The two exchanged glances before stepping into the sea of fire.

The flames pierced through the void, engulfing the two in a vast expanse of fire. This was merely the outer layer; for Luotian and Jiang Nanxuan, though the flames radiated immense power, they inflicted no harm.

They walked through an endless sea of fire, the sky and stars shrouded entirely in flames. No living creatures remained—only the sound of swirling fire echoed around them.

“Rustle… rustle…” The two moved swiftly, but as Luotian entered, he realized the path he had taken before was now indistinguishable. The fire seemed identical everywhere. As they ventured deeper, the temperature of the flames grew increasingly intense.

A day passed in silence. Luotian and Jiang Nanxuan moved swiftly; based on Luotian’s estimation, they would reach the Fire Domain in another two days—far swifter than his previous journey.

Yet, as time passed, both felt an unsettling shift. The flames’ temperature rose further, a normal occurrence, but it pressed upon them with an oppressive weight. Their bodies felt scorched.

“This is strange!” Luotian’s expression darkened. His former Sage-level strength had sensed the fire’s terror, but now as a peak Sage, he still felt its menace—this was most unusual. Normally, such flames should have no effect on them at all.

“Did we take the wrong path?” Jiang Nanxuan’s gaze deepened, his eyes scanning the endless fire. His voice carried a note of concern.

“Let’s press on. If something feels off, we’ll turn back immediately!” Luotian sighed, unable to think of a better plan. He and Jiang Nanxuan stepped deeper into the fire.

“Sizzle…” After walking for an hour, they halted abruptly—before them, the flames had changed color, and both felt a rising mist of white smoke from their bodies.

“Purple!” Jiang Nanxuan murmured, his eyes fixed on the deep purple flames before them.

Chapter 1151: Unsealing ( )

In the endless sea of fire, Luotian and Jiang Nanxuan stared grimly at the now-purple flames. Their expressions were heavy; they knew they had taken a wrong turn, for Luotian had never encountered such purple flames before.

The terrifying heat made even Luotian feel uneasy, his mind recalling how he had avoided entering during his Sage-level days—otherwise, he would have been reduced to ashes.

“Should we advance or retreat?” Jiang Nanxuan let out a bitter laugh. Though the purple flames still couldn’t harm them, they had clearly strayed from their original path.

“Let’s try another direction!” Luotian’s eyes flickered with reluctance. They had walked so far; people in the Fire Domain must be worried by now. Luotian feared that an impulsive person might rush into the Four Saints Star Domain, causing trouble.

“Fine,” Jiang Nanxuan replied without protest. He too believed their strength could overcome this fire.

“Hum…” As the two turned, their expressions abruptly shifted—around them, the red flames had suddenly transformed into deep purple, surging toward Luotian and Jiang Nanxuan.

“What’s going on?” Luotian furrowed his brow, sensing trouble and losing direction.

“It’s an illusionary array!” Jiang Nanxuan’s gaze sharpened as he observed the purple flames. His eyes then lit with understanding.

“If I’m not mistaken, this entire endless sea of fire is a natural and massive illusionary array! We’ve truly run into trouble!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face bore a bitter expression, his mind regretting not learning the teleportation array from Wan Lingkong. At that time, he had only assisted in setting it up but hadn’t studied the intricate diagram thoroughly before returning to the Four Saints Star Domain with Luotian.

If they had possessed a teleportation array, there would’ve been no need to risk entering the fire. They could have simply set up a teleportation array in the Four Saints Star Domain to return to the Fire Domain.

“What do we do?” Luotian had no say in matters of arrays, so he turned to Jiang Nanxuan with a hint of anxiety.

“I’ll try my best. This natural array is highly profound; I’m unsure if we can escape,” Jiang Nanxuan’s eyes were grave. He extended a hand, and black and white qi surged forth, gathering at his forehead.

“Hum…” A moment later, Jiang Nanxuan’s forehead split open, revealing the pattern of the Tian Huan Shenmo Flower. Luotian felt a stir in his heart.

“It’s just an opportunity. The Tian Huan Shenmo Flower excels at illusions, so we still have a great chance of escaping!” Jiang Nanxuan smiled and took a step forward.

Hearing Jiang Nanxuan’s words, Luotian finally calmed. He knew Jiang Nanxuan’s nature—his confidence meant at least a 90% chance of escaping this fire illusion.

“Eight hundred zhang ahead,” Jiang Nanxuan took a step and instantly appeared eight hundred zhang away. Luotian followed closely.

“Rustle… rustle…” The fire surged, as if sensing their threat. Purple fire dragons roared and charged toward the two.

“Boom!” Luotian swung his fist, shattering the fire dragons. He didn’t want external factors to hinder Jiang Nanxuan’s thoughts and insights.

“Move!” Jiang Nanxuan ignored Luotian, fully focused on navigating the fire. Luotian guarded Jiang Nanxuan’s side, constantly striking to scatter the fire dragons converging on them.

As time passed, Luotian felt they had ventured deeper; the pressure from the flames grew stronger. The color shifted from purple to gray, even making Luotian feel slightly uncomfortable.

Jiang Nanxuan’s body emitted rising white smoke, his face grim—evidently struggling and unable to endure long.

“Hum…” The ancient heavenly palace reappeared in Luotian’s hands, shielding the two.

“Almost there. However, what follows may be extremely perilous. The flames might become even more terrifying—perhaps something unknown will emerge!” Jiang Nanxuan caught his breath, standing beneath the ancient heavenly palace. His gaze bore deep apprehension toward the gray flames striking the barrier.

“This terrifying temperature could kill even a Sage at its peak! Even I can’t endure long!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, his gaze now more solemn as he watched the gray flames repeatedly battering the golden barrier.

“Let’s go—something feels off. It’s better to exit quickly!” Luotian felt an inexplicable sense of urgency, urging Jiang Nanxuan.

Jiang Nanxuan said nothing and nodded, continuing to walk through the fire. With the ancient heavenly palace’s protection, their safety was momentarily assured.

Time passed again. Jiang Nanxuan and Luotian had walked nearly half a day when the towering flames changed once more, turning into an inky black. It seemed to emerge from hell itself, striking the golden barrier with a terrifying heat that even through the shield, Luotian and Jiang Nanxuan felt. This black fire could burn any Sage at its peak, and even Luotian would not last long within it.

“What is this fire? I feel it’s even more terrifying than your Bijing Lilu Fire!” Jiang Nanxuan exclaimed, his calm demeanor finally shifting.

“This is…” Luotian’s eyes flashed with purple light as he felt an eerie sentience within the flames—like the Bijing Lilu Fire had evolved.

“Roar…” A deep roar echoed as Jiang Nanxuan and Luotian gazed in shock. The black flames coalesced, forming a humanoid shape—though it had no face, its form was distinct with limbs and a head.

“It has taken on human shape! If given another few hundred years, it might even evolve into a fire spirit!” Jiang Nanxuan murmured, watching the humanoid flames repeatedly crash against the golden barrier before disintegrating and reforming endlessly.

“Almost there—once we break through this black fire zone, we should escape the fire illusion!” Jiang Nanxuan sighed deeply. Facing such black flames, anyone would be terrified. Without the ancient heavenly palace’s presence, he and Luotian wouldn’t have lasted ten breaths.

“Terrifying—too terrifying! This Fire Domain is an absolute death trap. Unless one possesses a Chronos Relic, even a Chronos-beginner powerhouse would be unable to withstand this black fire!” Luotian’s gaze held a contemplative edge.

“Are you eyeing this black fire?” Jiang Nanxuan noticed the glint in Luotian’s eyes and shook his head.

“Other than a Chronos Relic, what could withstand such flames? Don’t even think about it!” Jiang Nanxuan cautioned Luotian.

“The ancient heavenly palace definitely can’t be taken, but I still have another relic on me—perhaps we can try it. Let’s see if this black fire can unlock its seal!” Luotian smiled, raising his hand to summon a black tortoise shell.

“What is this?” Jiang Nanxuan furrowed his brows, observing the tortoise shell before Luotian. He couldn’t discern any special features about it.

“Let’s try. I don’t know why, but I feel this fire can unlock the tortoise shell’s seal!” Luotian shrugged indifferently. If it could break the seal, that was great; if not, no harm done.

With this thought, Luotian extended his hand, launching the tortoise shell beyond the ancient heavenly palace’s barrier. It instantly appeared within the humanoid fire.

“Roar…” The black humanoid flames, sensing something approaching, instinctively rushed forward and enveloped the tortoise shell.

“It withstood!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face shifted, watching the tortoise shell absorbed into the black flames without a scratch. He now understood this shell was no ordinary object.

After all, it had withstood the black humanoid flames—flames capable of burning even a peak Sage or Chronos-level powerhouse! This shell was clearly extraordinary.

“Hum…” The black flames, sensing the tortoise shell’s defiance, seemed provoked. Numerous black figures surged toward it.

Yet the tortoise shell remained motionless, like a rock, enduring the black flames’ attacks without moving.

“I’ll help!” Luotian smiled and extended his hand, releasing a streak of emerald fire toward the shell.

“Boom!” The emerald Bijing Lilu Fire and black flames merged, enveloping the tortoise shell. They continuously scorched it.

As the Bijing Lilu Fire joined, two colors of flames formed serpentine dragons circling around the shell, burning it relentlessly.

“Hum…” With the Bijing Lilu Fire’s addition, the black tortoise shell finally reacted. Black energy radiated from it, forming black runes that spread outward.

“There’s hope!” Luotian’s eyes lit with joy, watching the runes spreading. He knew these were the seal forces within the tortoise shell, gradually being melted by the two flames’ extreme temperatures.

Jiang Nanxuan’s face also bore anticipation, eager to see what this seemingly ordinary shell—yet capable of withstanding two extreme flames—was truly.

Black runes spread across the sky, obscuring Luotian and Jiang Nanxuan’s vision. Yet this was the endless fire sea; under the terrifying heat, these black runes were constantly annihilated.

Black light surged forth, like a demonic sun rising. Under Luotian and Jiang Nanxuan’s expectant gazes, the shell began to tremble within the combined emerald and black flames.

“It’s done!” Luotian spoke softly, his voice filled with anticipation. His purple eyes glowed as he gazed at the shell beneath the black and green flames.

Chapter 1152: Yin Fish Eye ()

In the endless fire sea, black light descended. The black tortoise shell floated above the combined emerald and black flames, its ancient patterns flowing across it—clearly crafted by a master’s hand. It contained the Dao and principles, even leaving Luotian, who had mastered multiple paths of truth, awestruck by its complexity.

“This is a Chronos Relic! Only a Chronos Master could carve such intricate patterns!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face lit with joy. He hadn’t expected Luotian’s claim to be true—this unassuming shell was indeed a Chronos Relic.

Luotian’s eyes were equally excited. He had always known it was a Chronos Relic but hadn’t understood how to break its seal. Moreover, this relic might be closely tied to Sun Kenuan’s Chronos Relic.

“Hum…” As the two marveled, the black tortoise shell changed again—transforming into a small black fish that swam within the emerald and black flames.

“Suck…” The fish opened its mouth, releasing a powerful suction force. The fire that could burn anything trembled under this pull, transforming into humanoid forms and fleeing in all directions.

Yet the black fire’s speed was no match for the fish. One by one, humanoid flames were swallowed into its mouth.

“Return!” Luotian’s face darkened, quickly extending his hand to prevent the black fish from swallowing his Bijing Lilu Fire. He had no place to cry if that happened.

“Hum…” The black flames surged endlessly, fleeing in all directions. But the fish seemed like a bottomless pit, absorbing vast amounts of black fire.

Vacuum—this black tortoise shell expelled the formidable black flames, creating a vacuum around it. It floated there independently.

“I feel this shell is familiar…” Jiang Nanxuan furrowed his brows, gazing at the black tortoise shell. A sense of familiarity stirred in his mind—where had he seen this before?

Luotian’s face lit with joy. He stepped out of the ancient heavenly palace’s protection and approached the black tortoise shell, extending his hand to grasp the small fish.

“Hum…” The black tortoise shell sensed Luotian’s presence, as if he intended to claim it. It radiated black light.

The small fish emitted a powerful suction force, rushing toward Luotian as if to devour him.

“Even people are devoured! Nothing is beyond its grasp!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face shifted in shock. As a fusion of the Tian Huan Shenmo Flower, he had once followed the Lord of Gods and Demons. His knowledge was unparalleled; few could match him in this world.

“Luotian, that’s the Yin Fish Eye of the Lord of Gods and Demons’ Dao Diagram. Nothing is beyond its grasp. Be careful! The only way to subdue it is to be sucked into the Yin Fish Eye and gain the artifact spirit’s approval. However, this artifact spirit seems to be in slumber; otherwise, its suction would be stronger. The Lord of Gods and Demons once used the complete Dao Diagram to unleash a powerful suction force, devouring dozens of Chronos Peak masters!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face was stunned as he spoke, revealing the terrifying origin of this gray tortoise shell.

As Luotian heard Jiang Nanxuan’s words, his mind stirred—this was the most astonishing Chronos Master of all. The Lord of Gods and Demons, a being who cultivated both gods and demons, was revered across the Nine Realms. Even other Chronos Masters held deep respect for him. Cultivating both gods and demons to the level of a Chronos Master was an unparalleled feat, even for his two descendants who had specialized in gods and demons. This demonstrated the Lord of Gods and Demons’ extraordinary power.

“Fortune favors the bold!” Luotian’s expression hardened. He knew the Yin Fish Eye was fraught with danger; one misstep could cost his life.

But he had no choice—four saints’ star domain was too weak now. The ancient heavenly palace, though powerful, he could not fully control with his current strength.

This Yin Fish Eye was only a part of the Lord of Gods and Demons’ Dao Diagram. If he could master it, it might become his most powerful secret weapon at this moment.

“Never mind!” Luotian’s expression shifted, abandoning resistance to the fierce suction force. He was enveloped in black runes and gradually shrank, being sucked into the small fish’s belly.

“This…” Jiang Nanxuan’s face shifted. He finally bit his lip and rushed out of the ancient heavenly palace, also being sucked into the fish’s belly.

Jiang Nanxuan knew Luotian entering the Yin Fish Eye was a death sentence. However, he was the Tian Huan Shenmo Flower, carrying the aura of a Chronos Master. After all, this fish was an artifact of the Lord of Gods and Demons; perhaps he could assist Luotian.

“Hum…” Luotian felt the immense suction force and was instantly transported to a place of darkness.

The entire space was pitch-black, as if no light existed at all. Even with his Purple Extreme Demon Eyes activated, he could not see a single glimmer. When Luotian extended his spiritual awareness, his face shifted—his spiritual senses were instantly annihilated by the surrounding chaotic energy.

“This is the interior of the Yin Fish Eye. Everywhere is chaos. We must find the slumbering artifact spirit and subdue it to escape!” Jiang Nanxuan appeared beside Luotian, speaking softly.

“Senior Jiang!” Hearing Jiang Nanxuan’s voice, Luotian turned to look at him. His face suddenly shifted.

Before him, Jiang Nanxuan had become a shadow. Luotian could clearly see a blooming Tian Huan Shenmo Flower within Jiang Nanxuan’s body.

“No need to be surprised. This place has a strange power that returns one to their essence. I am the Tian Huan Shenmo Flower; the flower is me, so what you see is the Tian Huan Shenmo Flower!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke, gazing at Luotian. Yet his heart was stunned.

He saw Luotian and felt as if he gazed at an endless starry sky, his heart stunned by the mystery of Luotian’s essence.

“Let’s go—this path is dangerous. I carry the aura of the Lord of Gods and Demons; perhaps it will help in subduing the artifact spirit. Also, I can sense its general location!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, leading Luotian into the endless darkness. His body emitted glowing light, illuminating a hundred zhang around them.

“I wonder how Sun Kenuan obtained the approval of the Yang Fish Eye. This person must have had an extraordinary opportunity!” Luotian followed Jiang Nanxuan, his mind filled with admiration. If they could combine both eyes and find the Lord of Gods and Demons’ Dao Diagram, restoring it completely, what astonishing power would they unleash?

“Cough… cough…” As Luotian muttered Sun Kenuan’s name, in the distant Lord of Gods and Demons’ domain, Sun Kenuan and Sima Tuo were fleeing desperately. Behind them followed four elders, chasing after them.

“Damn it! The demon clan—why are you so harsh? We didn’t get anything at all!” Sun Kenuan and Sima Tuo shouted, fleeing through the starry void of the Lord of Gods and Demons’ domain.

“Hmph! Your courage is remarkable—daring to enter my demon clan’s hidden domain!” One elder in black robes, his aura of demonic energy fierce, glared at them.

“I swear! We just entered and were repelled by your old ones’ aura!” Sun Kenuan and Sima Tuo were in a desperate state. If not for the white tortoise shell protecting them, they would have already perished.

After their previous encounter with Luotian and Sun Mengru, they had seen the demon clan’s Southern Palace Bo use their pseudo-chronos relic. They wanted revenge.

With their current strength, they wouldn’t dare confront the demon clan head-on—no matter how many of them there were, they would be crushed. One person’s spit could kill them all.

But they had their own methods—stealing and robbing. Naturally, they targeted the demon clan’s ancestral tomb. Though they had luck entering when no one was around and found a pseudo-chronos relic, they were unlucky—stumbling upon the demon clan’s hidden domain and nearly awakening it. They were expelled by its overwhelming aura.

Naturally, they exposed themselves. The demon clan wouldn’t let them off easily for digging up their ancestor’s tomb. The Demon Lord personally led three peak sages to chase after Sun Kenuan and Sima Tuo. Though they had extraordinary skills, they barely escaped the demon clan’s grasp.

“Damn it! I’ll return this pseudo-chronos relic to you!” Sun Kenuan and Sima Tuo cursed, using the white tortoise shell to block the Demon Lord’s furious attacks.

“No! You both must die!” The Demon Lord was enraged. If they weren’t killed, the demon clan’s reputation would be ruined.

“Hum…” As Sun Kenuan and Sima Tuo ran, the white tortoise shell above them emitted a series of hums. Their faces shifted instantly.

“The Yin Fish Eye has appeared!” They both spoke, their voices filled with joy as they gazed at the distance.

“Toward the Four Saints Star Domain!” Using the Yang Fish Eye’s感应, they sensed the Yin Fish Eye’s location. Without hesitation, they flew toward the Demon Domain.

“I’ll move my sect! One day, when I return, I will shake the Lord of Gods and Demons’ domain!” Sun Kenuan shouted loudly, his voice filled with authority. He and Sima Tuo reactivated the tortoise shell, their speed increasing as they vanished from the Demon Lord’s and his four elders’ sight.

“Spit! You’re shameless, returning the sect! The entire Sect of Skillful Hands is just you two left—this counts as moving the sect?” One of the Demon Lord’s peak sages scoffed, his voice filled with disdain. He followed the Demon Lord as they chased after Sun Kenuan and Sima Tuo.

Chapter 1153: Entering the Tortoise Shell ()

In the endless fire sea, the black tortoise shell floated in space. Within a hundred li around it, like a vacuum, the immense aura of a Chronos Relic radiated outward. The surrounding black flames dared not approach, fearing being devoured by the black tortoise shell.

Inside the shell, Luotian and Jiang Nanxuan walked solemnly through the dark space. The surrounding chaos energy swept over them.

They wandered through the black space for an unknown duration, feeling no sense of time. This made them cautious.

“I can feel the slumbering artifact spirit is near!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face lit with a slight smile as he spoke to Luotian.

Luotian tensed, his eyes also showing solemnity. He knew that an artifact spirit of a Chronos Relic was no simple matter. Like the artifact spirit Meng Lingxiao in the ancient heavenly palace, it had been a god-like presence within.

“Hum…” As they were tense, a golden light surged toward them. Due to Jiang Nanxuan’s Tian Huan Shenmo Flower on his forehead, it could only illuminate a hundred zhang. Thus, when they sensed danger, the golden light had already reached their front.

Luotian moved swiftly and instantly appeared in front of Jiang Nanxuan, raising a radiant barrier with his golden sage power.

“Crack!” The next moment, Luotian’s barrier shattered under the golden light’s impact. It rushed toward them.

“What is this?” Luotian furrowed his brow, throwing a punch at the golden light. He felt its immense pressure and didn’t dare to be careless, using his full strength—Fana’s attack combined with the principle of breaking all. He clashed with the golden light.

“Boom…” Luotian’s face shifted instantly, a wave of extreme energy entering his body. He was blasted back, colliding with Jiang Nanxuan and retreating a hundred zhang.

“Crack…” Luotian’s body continuously cracked, and before his eyes appeared a golden bone. This caused him to spit blood profusely.

“This is! A Chronos Mid-level bone!” Jiang Nanxuan felt the aura of a Chronos-level entity on the bone and exclaimed, helping Luotian up.

“How could there be such things!” Luotian’s face was grim, his blood pressure surging. If not for his strong body, a regular peak sage would have been severely injured or even killed by this strike.

“If I’m not mistaken, this is the bone of a Chronos Mid-level master absorbed into the Lord of Gods and Demons’ Dao Diagram. Its flesh and essence have been refined by this black tortoise shell, leaving only these bones—still unrefined and full of divine essence. However, it’s weaker than a true Chronos Mid-level bone. Obviously, if time passes longer, it will be completely refined!” Jiang Nanxuan’s eyes were grave.

“A Chronos Mid-level master’s bone could subdue any peak sage. Fortunately, this bone’s divine essence has been largely refined by the dark space; otherwise, we would have truly been in danger!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face was grim as he spoke to Luotian. He hadn’t expected their first crisis to be so powerful.

A single Lord of Gods and Demons, with his boundless power, had once annihilated countless people. Who could count how many were killed? Jiang Nanxuan knew that several Chronos Peak masters had been devoured by the Lord of Gods and Demons’ Dao Diagram. If a Chronos Peak bone had met them, they would have been in real trouble.

Now, a single Chronos Mid-level bone had left Luotian so battered. If it were a Chronos Late or Peak level bone, they would have surely perished.

“However, now we’ve entered, there’s no other way out—only to continue forward. There is no alternative!” Luotian’s face was also grave, but his resolve was firm. He didn’t want to spend a lifetime in this endless darkness, dying alone. Moreover, he felt a sense of refinement energy filling his body.

Jiang Nanxuan, however, showed no signs of reaction. He seemed unaffected by the refinement energy, his eyes only filled with intense caution—caution over how to deal with a Chronos Peak bone.

Luotian and Jiang Nanxuan both knew they had no path back; only by finding the slumbering artifact spirit and subduing it could they escape this endless darkness.

Luotian collected the Chronos Mid-level bone, as it was rare now—should they encounter an enemy, throwing this bone might yield surprising results.

They exchanged a glance and moved more slowly, unsure when another bone would strike them.

“Boom…” As time passed, Luotian and Jiang Nanxuan had no idea how long they had wandered through the dark space. They moved like snails, encountering several crystalline Chronos bones. Fortunately, Luotian’s strong body had resisted the danger multiple times. Perhaps their luck was extraordinary, as they hadn’t encountered any Chronos Late-level bones—only a few Chronos Mid and Early-level remains. Each time, Luotian had paid the price of coughing blood to collect them.

Yet as time passed, Jiang Nanxuan felt they were approaching the slumbering artifact spirit. Their luck seemed to have run out.

“Hum…” A thunderous sound echoed as a crystalline rib bone surged toward them, appearing in their line of sight.

The rib bone moved at lightning speed, radiating immense pressure. Even though its divine essence had been refined by the refinement energy, it still carried a terrifying aura. The pressure made both of them feel their breaths were difficult to regulate.

“A Chronos Peak master’s rib bone!” Luotian exclaimed, staring at the bone radiating overwhelming pressure. His eyes trembled slightly.

The immense pressure swept over them, rendering both unable to move an inch—like a sovereign of the world pressing down upon them.

“Move!” Luotian roared, his eyes glowing with light as he unleashed the Dao Seal Demon Fist. He aimed to break free from this terrifying pressure, allowing them to move. If they faced it directly, both would be crushed into oblivion without any chance of survival. The only advantage was that this rib bone had no mind, acting blindly in the dark space without any pattern.

Luotian continuously swung his fists while Jiang Nanxuan unleashed a martial technique. They knew if they were struck by this Chronos Peak bone, both would be annihilated—Chronos Peak masters were among the top-tier individuals in the Nine Realms. They could pluck stars with their hands, being incredibly powerful.

“Hum…” The golden rib bone instantly reached them. At the critical moment, with Luotian and Jiang Nanxuan’s combined efforts, they finally broke free from the immense pressure. They moved their bodies and appeared a hundred zhang away.

“Boom…” The next moment, Luotian and Jiang Nanxuan felt their hair stand on end—narrowly escaping death.

The golden Chronos bone vanished from their sight, and they both sighed in relief.

“This is too dangerous!” Luotian cursed loudly, watching the vanished Chronos Peak bone and feeling amazed.

“Let’s go—since we’ve chosen to enter, prepare yourself!” Jiang Nanxuan also let out a bitter laugh and continued forward.

They walked cautiously through the dark space, narrowly avoiding bones. Time passed slowly, and Jiang Nanxuan’s face finally showed a look of joy.

“We’ve arrived!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, his voice filled with excitement. He gazed ahead, sensing the slumbering artifact spirit was within five hundred zhang.

Five hundred zhang—normally, for them it would take only a thought to reach. But now, moving at their snail’s pace, it would consume half a day.

Yet, perhaps sensing their difficulty, they hadn’t encountered any danger after narrowly avoiding two Chronos Peak bones. However, Luotian’s spiritual energy was nearly depleted in this dark space where no spiritual energy existed. Only the extreme refinement energy remained, making Luotian feel his entire body boiling—on the verge of transformation.

“We’ve arrived!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face was filled with excitement, the light illuminating a hundred zhang ahead. A crystalline bone sat in meditation, its head filled with flickering black flames—exactly the fire that had been devoured by the Yin Fish Eye.

What stunned them most was the crystalline bone’s immense Chronos aura, making their hearts heavy. Though it wasn’t as strong as the ancient heavenly palace, it was a level higher than Meng Shen.

“A Chronos Peak’s complete bone!” Jiang Nanxuan exclaimed, his eyes filled with solemnity as he spoke to Luotian.

“This is absurd! How can we subdue it if even a complete Chronos Peak bone is beyond our power?” Luotian shook his head, sighing. He cursed the Lord of Gods and Demons’ skill—even the artifact spirit was this powerful, hiding within a Chronos Peak bone. No one could subdue it.

“Let’s try releasing Dongbo Xin. His strength should be able to subdue it!” Jiang Nanxuan shook his head lightly, the only plan he could think of.

“Regardless, we should first awaken it!” Luotian didn’t argue with Jiang Nanxuan’s words but wanted to improvise.

Chapter 1154: Chronos Bones Forge a Cage ()

In the dark space, Luotian and Jiang Nanxuan stared grimly at the Chronos Peak bone less than a hundred zhang away. Even after countless years, it still radiated destruction and world-ending power, leaving both with no desire to resist.

They decided first to awaken the artifact spirit within the Chronos Peak bone before making a decision. If they couldn’t, they would have no choice but to release Dongbo Xin to resolve the current trouble.

However, they would only do so if forced into a corner. Jiang Nanxuan’s chance of awakening Dongbo Xin was high, but if he failed, it would be a disaster for them.

Thinking this through, Jiang Nanxuan didn’t hesitate. His hand glowed with golden spiritual energy, forming the shape of a divine flower. Though its power wasn’t great, it carried strange waves as it struck the golden bone.

“Hum…” The golden divine flower seemed to possess some magic, imprinting itself onto the golden bone.
