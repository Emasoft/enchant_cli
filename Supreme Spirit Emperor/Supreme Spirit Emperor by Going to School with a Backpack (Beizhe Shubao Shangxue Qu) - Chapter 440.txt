“Blazing Heaven Sword, Burning Sword Severing the Heavens!” Meng Xue whispered, then transformed into a stance with both hands gripping her sword. Her feet pressed against the earth as she leapt skyward, raising a seven-colored great sword amidst the seven-colored flames. With a mighty swing, she brought it crashing down upon Luo Tian.

At that moment, Meng Xue seemed like a divine warrior goddess, wielding the Celestial Sword of Creation. She carved a seven-colored fissure through the crimson heavens, and her overwhelming aura sent shivers down the spines of all present.

“Spear Master of the Heavens!” Luo Tian had no choice but to parry. To be outmatched by a woman would ruin his pride.

Golden light surged forth, and the Vajra Attack of the Buddha’s Heaven clashed against his spear. One force shattered a thousand methods, while the Eight Directions Falling Treasure Technique was also imbued into his Rending Heaven Spear. This spear was Luo Tian’s ultimate technique, the strongest he could unleash.

As for the Heavenly Dao Thunder Sword, Luo Tian chose not to use it. After all, there were too many people here—someone might recognize the sword and cause unnecessary trouble.

The golden spear cleaved through the sky, becoming a streak of light. Luo Tian too leapt into the air and thrust his spear forward.

The crimson heavens were torn open by their collision. Their attacks met in an instant.

“Crack…” The heavens exploded, and the golden spear tip clashed against the seven-colored sword. Upon contact, thunderous sounds erupted, and invisible waves radiated outward.

“Burst!” The golden spear suddenly bent before returning to its original form. Luo Tian and Meng Xue were both hurled backward, leaving deep imprints on the ground before retreating hundreds of paces.

“Excellent!” Meng Xue roared, then gazed at the scorched edge of her massive sword. She sheathed it after catching her breath, then strode toward Luo Tian.

“Hmph…” Seeing Meng Xue’s lack of further combat, Luo Tian sighed. If they continued fighting, it would be hard to determine a victor unless it was a life-or-death duel. He then sheathed his trembling Rending Heaven Spear.

“How much of your strength did you use?” Meng Xue asked, her voice carrying inquiry.

“Four or five tenths,” Luo Tian replied honestly. Since even Sun Mengru, Jiang Sxi, and Leng Qiuchan hadn’t sensed her killing intent, how could he have fought with full strength?

“Four or five tenths!” Meng Xue was slightly taken aback, then a smile of admiration appeared on her face. She had used six tenths of her strength and fought evenly with Luo Tian, instantly gauging their strengths.

“Let’s stop. We need to go in,” Luo Tian said, noticing the smile on Meng Xue’s face and speaking softly. He no longer wanted to deal with this woman who felt formidable.

“Wait!” But as Luo Tian turned, Meng Xue called him back. She stepped before him and said, “Did you marry me?”

“Cough! Cough!” Luo Tian nearly choked on his own spit, his face showing disbelief. He gazed at Meng Xue.

“What?” Luo Tian blinked in confusion, puzzled by this violent woman’s sudden words.

“I told you to marry me. Did you not hear?” Meng Xue said boldly, her expression fierce.

“Damn!” Luo Tian finally understood. He took a step back and rushed to the side of Jiang Sxi, his face innocent as he looked at them.

“This isn’t my fault. My three wives, let’s go quickly!” Luo Tian didn’t want to get involved with anyone else. This Meng Xue, he felt he couldn’t control.

Jiang Sxi, Leng Qiuchan, and Sun Mengru glared at Meng Xue with hostility. Though they believed Luo Tian wouldn’t accept her, she was still a threat. Although Meng Xue’s beauty paled in comparison to theirs, her figure was undeniably outstanding.

“Ah… Miss, we just met today. Saying such things isn’t good. Besides, I am already married. You should find someone else. I’m not one to be taken lightly!” Luo Tian said, trying to show loyalty as he glanced at the three women’s dark faces.

“Liar! I am one to be taken lightly? Do you feel that seven-colored flame on your body?” Meng Xue’s face turned angry.

“Yes… yes!” Luo Tian seemed to understand, his face flushed with embarrassment. He touched the seven-colored mark on his forehead, and Xiao Qi appeared before them.

“This flame is what my father left for me. Tell me, should I reclaim it?” Meng Xue smiled, her mind astonished—she hadn’t expected the item left by her father to have grown so much.

“My father gave this flame as my dowry. Tell me, shouldn’t you marry me?” Meng Xue didn’t wait for Luo Tian to respond and spoke again, causing his face to change.

“Ugh…” Luo Tian was stunned. He hadn’t expected the Flame Master to have such a move. However, Xiao Qi was his life-flame and could not be separated from him. If forcibly torn apart, it would harm both himself and Xiao Qi greatly.

“Of course, my man must be under my control. If you can’t defeat me, what right do you have to be my man?” Meng Xue said again, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Damn! Why didn’t you say that earlier? If you had, I would have lost to you!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly. He hadn’t expected a simple fight to cause such trouble.

“Ah… let’s forget it. I’ll give you something else as compensation. As for marrying you, I truly can’t!” Luo Tian shook his head gently, having no other choice but to refuse directly.

“No way. You’ve already accepted the dowry. Do you think you can back out? There’s no such luck!” Meng Xue shook her head.

“Sorry, this is our husband. You should find someone else. We can compensate you with a single immortal herb!” Jiang Sxi spoke softly, as the three women discussed how to handle this.

“Immortal herb?” Meng Xue’s face showed surprise, but she shook her head.

“Although immortal herbs are precious, I have one too. It’s unnecessary for me. Besides, he was chosen by my father. I can’t defy my father’s will!” Meng Xue spoke softly, as if commanding him.

“Impossible. This matter is not to be discussed again. It’s absolutely impossible!” Luo Tian said firmly, unwilling to waste time further. He stepped forward into the battlefield.

Jiang Sxi, Leng Qiuchan, and Sun Mengru smiled as they followed Luo Tian toward the Xian Tide.

“What are you doing?” But when Luo Tian and his group reached the battlefield’s edge, a group of people blocked their path, eyes filled with danger.

“Enter the Xian Tide!” Luo Tian coldly said, ignoring them and gazing at Diao Dezhu and others in the Xian Tide.

“Let them through!” Diao Dezhu cleared his throat, speaking with authority. Instantly, the people blocking Luo Tian’s path dispersed, creating a path through the vast battlefield for him and his group.

“This works?” Luo Tian was puzzled, unsure what Diao Dezhu had done to make these strong individuals obey him.

But Luo Tian didn’t waste the opportunity. His body flickered, and he rushed with Jiang Sxi and the others toward the Xian Tide. Meng Xue gritted her teeth but followed behind Luo Tian.

“Hey, sister, why are you following us? If you’re refining the Xian Qi, then it’s just repaying your father’s favor. We’ll be even!” Luo Tian spoke quickly, trying to find an opportunity to repay the debt of the Flame Master.

Chapter 1717: You’ve Been Fooled

The wide road opened up, and Luo Tian’s group felt intense tension, fearing the遗民 might suddenly attack them.

“Don’t think I don’t know you’re lying. If you don’t let me in, I’ll shout it out!” Meng Xue transmitted her thoughts to Luo Tian, smiling as she followed behind him.

Meng Xue didn’t know how those people in the Xian Tide had entered, but she also knew their strength. If it were purely by strength, those people wouldn’t have obeyed the former trial participants.

“You…” Hearing Meng Xue’s transmission, Luo Tian gritted his teeth. But it was indeed true—Luo Tian had also guessed that Diao Dezhu and others must have used some method. If it were exposed, it would cause a backlash from the former trial participants, which would be problematic.

They passed without incident under the envious glances of others and entered the Xian Tide, their eyes filled with infinite joy.

“Luo Tian…” As soon as Luo Tian entered, Diao Dezhu and Zheng Xin stood up, gazing at him with joy.

“Long time no see!” Luo Tian smiled at the group. Some had been his enemies, others his brothers. Now, due to the invasion of countless tribes, they were all from the Nine Domains and pillars for the great battle.

“Hurry up and absorb it. We don’t know when it will be exposed. If it is, that’ll be trouble!” However, Jiang Nanxuan transmitted to Luo Tian and the others, urging them to act quickly. After all, it wasn’t a time for nostalgia.

“Okay!” Luo Tian nodded and ignored Meng Xue, leading his three wives to sit on the altar. He activated his cultivation technique and began absorbing and refining the furious Xian Qi.

Numerous spirit beasts formed from Xian Qi circled above their heads, and waves of Xian Qi surrounded them. Luo Tian was thrilled.

“If I absorb all this Xian Qi, my轮回通道 (Cyclic Channel) might turn into one forged from Xian Qi. Then I might be able to attain the Heavenly Dao Realm!” Luo Tian thought, but he wasn’t greedy. He wouldn’t leave nothing for others.

“Hum…” The Wheel of Heaven Technique activated, and in an instant, fine threads of Xian Qi were absorbed into his body. The technique refined it and stored it within the Cyclic Channel in his dantian.

“Slowly. I hope those outside won’t find out too soon!” Luo Tian whispered, although the Xian Qi was vast. Even for him, refining it took time. Let alone others.

Time flowed slowly. The Xian Tide and its surroundings formed a strange scene. People from the Nine Domains within the Xian Tide focused on refining the Xian Qi, while a fierce battle erupted outside.

“Boom…” The collision sound echoed. Nan Gong Wu Bei, Sun Zhangyang, and Fu Tu were beaten back by Du Hongxi’s group.

Though they were strong, four against three was no match. Around them were many watching with intent, and among these people were strong individuals. Their group was also powerful but had suffered losses after this long battle, leaving them in disarray.

“Great one, I killed one!” A strong man had torn apart a warrior from Nan Gong Wu Bei’s group and smiled, approaching the Xian Tide to report.

“Hmph. Kill two more. You may enter!” Diao Dezhu nodded, encouraging the strong man.

“Ah… okay…” The strong man nodded and then looked at Nan Gong Wu Bei’s group, who were in disarray.

“Hum…” A powerful pressure rose. Nan Gong Wu Bei and Sun Zhangyang finally couldn’t hold out, summoning the Emperor Sword and Demon Emperor’s Blade. Fu Tu also summoned the Star Moon Divine Spear, and golden light descended, hovering above their heads.

The young man in the embroidered robe also had a cold expression. His hands flashed with divine laws, and a golden divine mace hovered above their heads.

“Four!” Seeing the four Epoch Treasures hovering over Nan Gong Wu Bei’s group, Du Hongxi and others’ faces changed. They hadn’t expected that Nan Gong Wu Bei’s group, who were in disarray under their attack, also possessed treasures forged by Heavenly Dao Realm masters.

“Although I don’t know why you obey those bastards, if you want to destroy us, let’s see your ability!” As Nan Gong Wu Bei and others summoned the four Epoch Treasures, the battlefield temporarily stopped. Nan Gong Wu Bei’s group looked at Du Hongxi with hatred.

“Having treasures forged by Heavenly Dao Realm masters is impressive. I didn’t want to use Xian Qi, but it seems I can’t avoid it!” Du Hongxi’s face was cold. He waved his hands, and green gas flew out of them, instantly covering everyone’s heads. Nan Gong Wu Bei’s group could feel the terrifying poison within the green gas, corroding even the crimson sky above them.

“Since you’re going to fight, could you explain why you obey those bastards?” The young man in the embroidered robe asked with confusion, looking at Du Hongxi. Obviously, they had felt the greatest pressure from them.

“Heavenly Dao Realm. One of you is in the Heavenly Dao Realm. Blame it on your lack of a Heavenly Dao Realm master!” Guan Yuxin said with admiration, his hands moving. Black clouds descended, and a terrifying pressure fell upon them. Golden divine beams flashed within the black clouds.

Ma Xiuzhen waved his hand, gathering chaotic energy. A terrifying power凝聚 in his hands.

“What?” Hearing Guan Yuxin’s words, Nan Gong Wu Bei and others were stunned. Their eyes showed disbelief as they looked at Luo Tian’s group sitting in the Xian Tide, unable to understand how they had become Heavenly Dao Realm masters. They knew that a Heavenly Dao Realm master was an Epoch Lord in the Nine Domains. If someone truly attained the Heavenly Dao Realm, how could they play?

“Impossible!” Nan Gong Wu Bei, Fu Tu, Sun Zhangyang, and the young man in the embroidered robe all spoke at once.

But before they could react, Du Hongxi and Guan Yuxin had already attacked. They launched their martial arts toward Nan Gong Wu Bei’s group.

Green poison clouds surged, and Du Hongxi’s hands were filled with Xian Qi. He infused it into the poison clouds, instantly increasing their power and corroding the sky toward them.

“Crash…” Black clouds released countless divine swords, each radiating an ancient might.

Chaotic energy凝聚, and invisible waves were released from Ma Xiuzhen’s hands. Other遗民 also launched their martial arts, each carrying a destructive aura. Sun Zhangyang’s group immediately looked grim.

“Damn you!” They thought they had been tricked by Luo Tian’s group, but before they could speak, a series of martial arts capable of killing an准王 (near-king) were launched at them, giving no time to speak.

“Damn!” Their faces were grim. They had no choice but to endure, channeling their Epoch Power into the four supreme weapons.

“Hum…” The four supreme weapons surged with light. Under Nan Gong Wu Bei’s group’s full power, they released an ultimate aura. The powerful energy shook the heavens.

Epoch Treasures, fully activated, equaled a single attack from an Epoch Lord or King. The four weapons radiated brilliant light and clashed with the martial arts launched by Du Hongxi’s group.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” A series of explosions echoed beneath the crimson sky. The crimson heavens exploded, and a terrifying storm swept outward with each collision.

“Spit…” Several figures spat blood, their bodies flying backward. Many of the遗民 with Epoch Peak strength were crushed into blood mist by the storm and vanished within it.

“Truly impressive!” Luo Tian’s group felt admiration. They hadn’t expected such a result, watching the terrifying explosion. Even Luo Tian’s spiritual sense couldn’t penetrate it. But they were relieved that this terrifying explosion was blocked by the Xian Tide, preventing it from causing chaos.

“Truly satisfying. Watching two groups fight is quite enjoyable!” Zheng Xin and others also felt admiration, watching the terrifying storm sweeping endlessly.

“Just a small trick, I’ve wiped out so many enemies!” Diao Dezhu smiled proudly. His eyes glowed with power, standing there with an aura of loneliness and invincibility.

“Today’s performance was great. I won’t hit you!” Xu Liyi and others felt good, for the first time not mocking Diao Dezhu’s show-off. They even showed some support.

“Great fortune, great fortune! Everyone, keep going!” Gu Lei transmitted to everyone and then sat down again, continuing to refine the澎湃 (surging) Xian Qi.

Dust settled. The area around the Xian Tide became a vacuum, with the crimson earth torn open to reveal red stone.

Numerous disheveled figures appeared in Luo Tian’s group’s perception, their bodies battered and wounded. None were spared.

“Such residual power from the collision still has survivors?” Luo Tian allocated part of his mind to observe the battle, then felt amazed.

“You guys were tricked…!” Sun Zhangyang spoke weakly, spitting blood continuously. His voice was weak.

Chapter 1718: Confrontation

“What?” Du Hongxi, Guan Yuxin, and Ma Xiuzhen heard Sun Zhangyang’s words. Their faces showed confusion. Bloodied and battered, they slowly stood up, gazing at Sun Zhangyang with heavy breaths.

“I said you were tricked. They don’t have a Heavenly Dao Realm master! You stupid bastards!” Sun Zhangyang cursed, spitting blood. The previous clash had not only caused heavy losses among the遗民 but also among their side.

At this moment, besides Sun Zhangyang, Nan Gong Wu Bei, Fu Tu, and the young man in the embroidered robe, their group had fewer than ten people left. All were wounded.

This made Sun Zhangyang and others feel extremely depressed, their mouths spitting blood continuously. Whether it was anger or actual injuries, they couldn’t tell. If they had been able to fight against Luo Tian’s group before, now they had no chance of victory. Even they were severely wounded.

“Impossible!” Du Hongxi and others showed disbelief, still not fully understanding Sun Zhangyang’s words.

“They just wanted to delay time. Do you think we wouldn’t act?” Guan Yuxin coughed up blood, stood up, and his aura rose again.

“Idiot! A Heavenly Dao Realm master is so easily attained? We come from the same world. We know them well. Their leader, Luo Tian, is the strongest among them. He hasn’t achieved it yet. How could others?”

“We are enemies. Do you think they would let us go if they had a Heavenly Dao Realm master?” Nan Gong Wu Bei roared, his face red with anger.

“Which one of them is a Heavenly Dao Realm master?” Fu Tu roared, his voice filled with resentment.

“Isn’t it that one in the purple robe?” Ma Xiuzhen looked at Fu Tu’s group with a grim face, sensing something strange.

“Ha… cough…” Seeing Ma Xiuzhen pointing at Diao Dezhu sitting there, Sun Zhangyang and Nan Gong Wu Bei laughed. But that laughter was more like crying.

“Him? A Heavenly Dao Realm master?” Sun Zhangyang showed disdain, gazing at Diao Dezhu. He was trembling with anger, unable to believe he had been tricked into such a pitiful state.

“Liar! I can beat him ten times over. How dare he be a Heavenly Dao Realm master?” Fu Tu’s face was also dark.

“Why are you still looking? Don’t you want to enter the Xian Tide? Hurry up and attack!” Diao Dezhu, hearing their conversation, slowly stood up. His authoritative voice rang out, and his aura rose again.

“This…!” Hearing Diao Dezhu’s words, Du Hongxi and others hesitated. They didn’t know who to believe. If Sun Zhangyang’s words were true, they had suffered a heavy loss.

But Diao Dezhu’s aura was indeed Heavenly Dao Realm. However, seeing Sun Zhangyang’s wild expression, they also believed his words.

“Now that they are injured, kill them quickly. You can then enter the Xian Tide!” Diao Dezhu spoke again, his brows slightly furrowed. His aura rose, and he looked at Sun Zhangyang with a stern gaze.

“Probably couldn’t hold it this time!” Luo Tian guessed as he watched Du Hongxi’s group.

“Show-off, I only respect Diao Dezhu. If I didn’t know his appearance, I would have believed he was a great immortal. I really want to know how he did it!” Zheng Xin and others discussed, gazing at Diao Dezhu standing there.

“Sir, we are severely injured and cannot fight!” Ma Xiuzhen turned his eyes, then spat out blood. His face was pale.

“Damn! You’re showing off in front of me. Don’t you know what I do?” Diao Dezhu saw Ma Xiuzhen’s exaggerated performance and shook his head. The level of show-off was far below his.

“Yes, sir, we are also injured and cannot fight!” Du Hongxi and others quickly responded. They spat out blood, their faces pale as they gazed at Diao Dezhu.

“Damn you, Diao Dezhu! Now that it’s come to this, are you still showing off? Heavenly Dao Realm! If you dare, I’ll beat you so badly your mother wouldn’t recognize you!” Sun Zhangyang shouted, spitting out blood again. He was extremely unwilling to have been tricked by Diao Dezhu.

“Sun Zhangyang,不服气?” Diao Dezhu’s face still carried authority. He gazed at Sun Zhangyang, his voice filled with disdain.

“Sir, these young men are too much for you to handle!” As Diao Dezhu was about to continue showing off, Luo Tian smiled and spoke to him. He cooperated with Diao Dezhu’s show-off. After all, today Diao Dezhu had done a great deed. Luo Tian was also generous in satisfying his vanity.

“Indeed, sir, you should just continue to cultivate here. The rest is ours!” Yao Chen stood up slowly, his body glowing with golden light.

“Ha! Sir, we’ll take care of him!” Others also stood up. Especially Zhou Wei and his son, their faces filled with hatred. They had attacked the Star Palace before.

With a rustle, Long Jie, Xu Liyi, Zhu Ge Qingtian, and Zhu Ge Jie, Run Hongyu, etc., also stood up. Their eyes held smiles as they gazed at Nan Gong Wu Bei.

“Damn!” Seeing Luo Tian’s group, Nan Gong Wu Bei and others’ faces turned grim. Now they were injured and couldn’t fight Luo Tian’s group.

“Kill…” But then, they thought of a plan. If these former trial participants joined forces with them, there would still be a chance to fight back.

To get these former trial participants to join forces with them, they just needed to prove that Diao Dezhu wasn’t a Heavenly Dao Realm master. Then, without needing them to act, these former trial participants would immediately become enraged and attack Luo Tian’s group.

“Hum…” The four supreme treasures were activated again, radiating a terrifying aura. They clashed toward Diao Dezhu in the Xian Tide.

“Damn!” Diao Dezhu felt his heart tremble. He sensed the four supreme treasures attacking him. His heart trembled, nearly losing control. After all, the pressure from four Epoch Treasures was immense—enough to kill a second-life immortal.

“Don’t expose it!” Luo Tian transmitted to Diao Dezhu and spoke to Nan Gong Wu Bei’s group.

“Daring to attack the master, you don’t want to live?” Luo Tian roared and launched his Rending Heaven Spear toward the Emperor Sword. At the same time, Long Jie activated the Divine Beast Mirror. The mirror radiated ultimate power. The Shura Domain’s Shura Blade, the Starry Sky Domain’s Star Tower, and the Chaos Domain’s Chaos Bell all rose up. They clashed with the four treasures heading toward the Xian Tide.

“Crack…” A loud explosion echoed again. The earth-shattering waves swept outward, causing Du Hongxi’s group to change faces and retreat further away from the storm.

Sun Zhangyang’s group also retreated. They were relieved that the crimson battlefield’s rules had suppressed them, otherwise they would have been swept by the residual waves. That would mean their deaths or being slaughtered by Luo Tian’s group.

The storm swept for about thirty breaths before finally calming. Sun Zhangyang’s group just caught their breath when they saw figures rising from the dust, rushing toward them.

“Sun Zhangyang, you really enjoyed chasing us before. Now I’ll see what skills you have!” Xu Liyi and Zheng Xin, Gu Lei, etc., cursed. They had suffered a lot from Sun Zhangyang’s group before and were chased like dogs, leaving them extremely frustrated. Now was the perfect time to vent.

“Alliance of Ten Thousand Realms, who do you want to destroy?” Luo Tian led the charge and appeared before Sun Zhangyang. He punched forward, aiming at Sun Zhangyang.

“Damn!” Sun Zhangyang’s face was grim. But Luo Tian’s attack had already reached him. Although he was injured, he could only choose to parry.

After thinking, Sun Zhangyang’s face turned wild. He thought of his hatred toward Luo Tian. Their previous battles had all ended in defeat. If it weren’t for Luo Tian, he and Nan Gong Wu Bei would have already unified the Demon Realm.

“Ah…” Sun Zhangyang roared and punched forward, clashing with Luo Tian’s fist.

“Crack…” The next moment, a crackling sound echoed. Sun Zhangyang’s body flew backward like a broken kite.

“You really haven’t improved at all!” Luo Tian smiled, watching Sun Zhangyang flying backward. He then stepped forward again toward Sun Zhangyang.

Sun Zhangyang had suffered serious injuries, but Luo Tian hadn’t been harmed after his battle with Meng Xue. He had only lost some Epoch Power, but after refining the Xian Qi, his dantian now contained a thick thread of Xian Qi. This made his strength rise again. In this case, he was confident in defeating Sun Zhangyang who had been injured.

On the other side, Yao Chen faced Nan Gong Wu Bei. Zhu Ge Qingtian fought Fu Tu. Run Hongyu confronted the young man in the embroidered robe.

Others attacked the black-cloaked warriors in groups, constantly suppressing them. Killing them was just a matter of time.

Crushing victory—when the two groups met, it was an immediate one-sided battle. Only Nan Gong Wu Bei and Fu Tu could resist a little, while others were completely dominated.

Chapter 1719: Sun Zhangyang’s Pride

“Boom…” A heavy sound echoed. Luo Tian’s fists fell like rain, and Sun Zhangyang’s body kept retreating. Each punch from Luo Tian made Sun Zhangyang’s face pale, his heart filled with rage.

“Back then, the two of you couldn’t match me. Now what right do you have to oppose me?” Luo Tian shouted, his aura radiant. His golden foot suddenly stepped forward, crushing Sun Zhangyang’s body.

“Boom…” Sun Zhangyang fell to the ground in a pitiful state, his face pale. Many of his bones were exposed, and he had no good place on his body.

No chance to fight back, Sun Zhangyang was crushed under Luo Tian’s foot. He kept roaring but felt his body’s power seemed sealed, as if a mountain had been pressed on his back.

“How strong he is!” Sun Zhangyang roared in his heart. Over the years, he had made progress, but he hadn’t expected Luo Tian’s growth to be so massive. Back then, they had a chance against Luo Tian, but now he was crushed under his feet in such a short time.

Sun Zhangyang didn’t know that while they had made progress over the years, Luo Tian hadn’t lagged behind. Sun Zhangyang was injured, and Luo Tian had refined some Xian Qi, making his strength stronger.

“Over the years, you’ve been jumping around. Did you really think you were important?” Luo Tian took another step forward, causing Sun Zhangyang’s chest to cave in. His whole body seemed deflated.

“Even the son of the Demon Emperor is no match for this!” On another side, Yao Chen held a golden staff and swept it over Nan Gong Wu Bei’s head. Nan Gong Wu Bei flew like a meteor into the ground, with a crackling sound.

“Chaos Produces Thunder!” A green lightning bolt descended from the sky, striking Fu Tu. The smell of charred flesh rose from Fu Tu’s body.

“A primordial clan member, yet you’ve come to our human domain to defecate!” Zhu Ge Qingtian’s face was cold as he watched Fu Tu, who had lost his previous handsome appearance.

“Cough… cough…” On another side, Run Hongyu also unleashed power. His golden hand turned into a knife and repeatedly slashed the young man in the embroidered robe.

“Spit… spit…” Blood mist rose as the black-cloaked warriors were turned into blood mist by Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi. They disappeared from sight, and whether they chose to revive or leave was beyond Luo Tian’s group.

“Luo Tian, do you think this is over? Don’t worry. Even if you kill me, as long as I live one day, I’ll wait for an opportunity in the shadows until you die!” Sun Zhangyang’s face was pale, crushed under Luo Tian’s foot. But he still spoke harshly.

“These people are strong. At first, I didn’t feel much, but after refining some Xian Qi, they are no match for us!” Du Hongxi said with admiration, gazing at Sun Zhangyang’s group being crushed by Luo Tian.

“If there are such people as subordinates, then he must be a Heavenly Dao Realm master!” Guan Yuxin looked at Diao Dezhu sitting on the altar with reverence.

“Almost deceived by them. That spear-wielding youth and that staff-wielding monkey gave me a sense of fear, no less than us!” Ma Xiuzhen’s face was dark as he spoke. They hadn’t fought, but instead recovered their injuries while observing the one-sided battle. As Luo Tian’s group attacked, they also believed Diao Dezhu was a Heavenly Dao Realm master and secretly felt relieved about their decision.

“Hmm…” Diao Dezhu sat on the altar, his face showing a hint of satisfaction. His gaze swept over Luo Tian’s group. This look was like looking at subordinates, and it made those who had participated in the trials more certain of their guess.

“Even in this state, you still talk back! If you choose to revive here on the crimson battlefield, I’ll keep you permanently!” Luo Tian sneered and didn’t want to waste words. He placed his Rending Heaven Spear in hand, its sharp tip aiming at Sun Zhangyang.

“Emperor Sword!” Sun Zhangyang saw the cold light of Luo Tian’s Rending Heaven Spear. His eyes showed fear, and a sense of death immediately passed through his mind. He roared wildly.

“Hum…” The divine light flashed, and the Emperor Sword radiated waves of divine beams. It instantly flew toward Luo Tian and Sun Zhangyang.

At the moment Luo Tian’s Rending Heaven Spear pierced Sun Zhangyang, the Emperor Sword also arrived at Luo Tian’s front, aiming for his back.

“Mutual destruction?” Luo Tian frowned slightly. He ultimately gave up and vanished from the spot.

“Come on, fight back!” Sun Zhangyang stood up pitifully, his clothes in disarray. His eyes showed madness as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“Originally, you were afraid of death too!” Sun Zhangyang’s eyes showed mockery as he gazed at Luo Tian. The Emperor Sword had missed, and it was now in Sun Zhangyang’s hand.

“You’re not worthy of dying with me!” Luo Tian’s eyes glowed cold. He then moved again, his Rending Heaven Spear becoming a streak of light as he rushed toward Sun Zhangyang.

“God! Destroying the Nine Heavens!” But Sun Zhangyang didn’t care. His face was cold, and his aura rose. Divine patterns burst out from his body. In an instant, Sun Zhangyang’s broken flesh recovered at a visible rate.

“Divine clan’s forbidden technique?” Luo Tian thought, surprised that Sun Zhangyang used a divine clan’s forbidden technique at this moment.

Although the crimson battlefield allowed one death, who knew what consequences would arise after using a forbidden technique?

“Kill!” But at this moment, Luo Tian had no time to think about other things. The cold spear tip was already near Sun Zhangyang.

“Hum…” The long sword soared across the sky. Sun Zhangyang held the Emperor Sword’s hilt with one hand and supported it with the other.
