The disciples of the Water Source Sect who were assigned to guard the location, upon seeing Chen Changsheng, naturally let him pass. Five people walked briskly towards a cave.

Outside the cave's entrance, many disciples of the Water Source Sect in their sect robes stood anxiously, eyes filled with eagerness as they gazed at the dark cave.

The leader, an old man, radiated a formidable aura. He gazed at the cave's entrance and sensed someone approaching behind him, his face breaking into a smile.

"Junior Chen Changsheng greets the Grand Elder!" Chen Changsheng, his face filled with reverence, bowed respectfully to the old man.

"Hmph. Go ahead. Once your elder brother arrives, you may enter." The old man's face showed satisfaction.

Chen Changsheng exchanged greetings with the disciples of the Water Source Sect and then led Luo Tian and the others to stand beside Pang Haoran, who had arrived earlier.

Upon seeing Chen Changsheng's arrival, Pang Haoran did not approach him first. His four companions also ignored Luo Tian and the others who had just arrived, except for Ying Hongtu, who opened his eyes, a hint of amusement in his gaze as he glanced at Luo Tian before resuming meditation.

Not long after Chen Changsheng and his group arrived, the wind stirred again, carrying a fierce aura from afar.

Five figures drew everyone's attention. The calm Pang Haoran and his group all turned their gazes toward the five figures.

"Unexpectedly, we were the last to arrive. Apologies for the delay; there was some business on the way," a voice said, its tone gentle and entering everyone's ears.

A tall young man in the same sect robe appeared before them. Behind him stood four figures clad in black, their faces obscured by veils. An ominous aura radiated from them, making people feel fear.

Most striking was the fact that they dragged a twenty-zhang-long azure serpent behind them. Though dead, its body still emitted a fresh blood scent, indicating it had died only moments ago.

"Thud..." The five figures threw the serpent to the ground, producing a heavy sound.

Chapter 197: Rules

Chapter 197: Rules

Luo Tian saw the serpent. Perhaps due to his long time spent with fierce beasts in Dian Forest, he had no particular aversion towards them and regarded them as equals. Seeing this fierce beast was already dead, it made Luo Tian feel uneasy. His gaze turned to the leader of the group, his eyes filled with hostility.

"Word has it that Grand Elder enjoys crafting artifacts. This Azure Mirage Emperor Snake was encountered by me on the way and I killed it, offering it to Grand Elder. I hope Grand Elder will like it!" The young man shouted loudly, respectfully gazing at the old man.

"Azure Mirage Emperor Snake!" Upon hearing this name, the disciples of the Water Source Sect inhaled sharply.

Even Chen Changsheng and Pang Haoran's groups looked solemnly at the figure standing proudly before them.

The Azure Mirage Emperor Snake was a Yellow-ranked high-level fierce beast, its strength comparable to the initial stage of Bone Forging. Due to its nature as a fierce beast, it was slightly stronger than an average Bone Forging initial-stage human.

Their elder brother Tu Yu Zheng had killed them so easily. What was the strength of these people?

"Grand Elder's might!" The disciples of the Water Source Sect all shouted loudly.

But Luo Tian did not look at the sect's elder brother. Instead, he gazed at the four veiled figures behind them, a strong pressure rising from his heart. His eyes showed caution.

Luo Tian observed the four figures' cold and ominous aura, feeling an inexplicable familiarity. He glanced at them twice.

Tu Yu Zheng's four figures seemed to sense Luo Tian's gaze. Four eyes flashed like lightning, gazing at Luo Tian. Upon realizing he was only at the Body Tempering Stage Eight, they showed contempt and withdrew their gazes.

When the four figures looked at him, Luo Tian suddenly felt a sense of danger. In the Body Tempering Stage, few people could make him feel this way. Yet these four did so, and he resolved to be cautious against them when entering the cave.

"Haha! You have my gratitude, Grand Elder. Once I refine this Azure Mirage Emperor Snake, I will craft an inner armor for you!" The Grand Elder laughed twice and spoke.

"Then I shall thank the Grand Elder in advance," Tu Yu Zheng bowed respectfully.

"Enough. You should also greet Changsheng and Haoran," the Grand Elder said kindly, then instructed disciples to carry away the serpent's corpse.

Tu Yu Zheng led his four figures before Chen Changsheng and Pang Haoran's groups: "You arrived quite early."

Feeling the pressure from Tu Yu Zheng's group, Pang Haoran, Chen Changsheng and their people, including Luo Tian, all flashed a hint of caution.

"Senior Brother, who are these four?" Pang Haoran asked first, trying to uncover their identities for a better chance in future encounters.

"They are just four friends I met while wandering. Solitary cultivators, no sect or clan," Tu Yu Zheng naturally understood Pang Haoran's implication and smiled.

"Senior Brother's luck is truly good. How fortunate to meet four strong individuals during your wandering!" Pang Haoran knew asking was futile, so he sighed and said no more.

Three groups maintained silence, observing each other with intense hostility.

"Enough. Now that everyone has arrived, this tomb of a Revenant Master can be opened!" The Grand Elder's voice echoed in everyone's ears.

Each of the three groups led their four invited people to the Grand Elder. The disciples of the Water Source Sect, who were among the strongest in Body Tempering Stage, looked with eagerness and shouted their support for each of the three.

The Grand Elder raised his hand slightly, then spoke: "Once inside, whoever obtains the震天鉴 in the tomb's depths will be considered successful. That person shall become your sect's young master."

"Zhen Tian Jian?" People heard this unfamiliar name, not knowing what it was. However, Luo Tian and others knew that even if it were a precious treasure, it would never reach their hands. Helping was helping, but the Water Source Sect would never let a treasure fall into others' hands.

"Also, as for those who came to help, I don't care how you fight. If one of my sect's three disciples dies, no matter your sect or background, you must pay with your lives for my sect's disciple!" The Grand Elder's cold gaze swept over Luo Tian and the others.

When his gaze fell on Luo Tian, it paused slightly. As the Grand Elder of the Water Source Sect, he could sense that although Luo Tian was only at Body Tempering Stage Eight, his aura was far stronger than others.

Hearing the Grand Elder's blatant threat, their faces darkened. The Grand Elder's meaning was clear: they could not kill the Water Source Sect disciples, but the sect's disciples could kill them. This would make them cautious when facing the Water Source Sect disciples.

At their level, even a slight mistake could be seized by opponents. Yet they did not express any dissatisfaction. Before the tomb of a Revenant Master, this injustice was acceptable.

Ignoring their reactions, the Grand Elder held a whisk in his hand, which he had apparently acquired at some point. His face showed solemnity.

"Is this the sect's sacred treasure, the Celestial and Profound Dust?" Jing Bolan looked with admiration at the whisk in the Grand Elder's hand.

"Just an imitation. Its rank is equivalent to a High-Grade Artifact. This must be the Grand Elder's own imitation. The Grand Elder is renowned in our sect for his artifact crafting skills!" Chen Changsheng explained to everyone.

"I see. How precious this treasure is, yet it's on a Grand Elder. But your Grand Elder is truly gifted, able to imitate such an artifact and it's even a High-Grade one!" Chai Xiangming also sighed in admiration.

As everyone marveled, the Grand Elder cast his whisk into the air, which emitted a gentle aura.

"Buzz..." A wave spread. The whisk landed at the cave's entrance, and a formation suddenly activated, revealing a dark cave mouth.

"Enter! This formation was set by the sect's Soul-Link Stage disciples. I can only activate it for a moment. Once inside, your fate is in your own hands!" The Grand Elder looked meaningfully at the three: Chen Changsheng, Pang Haoran and Tu Yu Zheng.

Chapter 198: Alone

Chapter 198: Alone

As the Grand Elder's words faded, Tu Yu Zheng immediately rushed forward with his four black-cloaked figures and plunged into the cave entrance without hesitation.

Seeing Tu Yu Zheng had taken the lead, Pang Haoran's eyes flashed with anger. He pushed off the ground and disappeared from the disciples' sight.

Chen Changsheng's eyes showed a hint of anxiety. He said to Luo Tian and the others: "Let's go in too!"

Before he finished speaking, Chen Changsheng had already reached the cave entrance and rushed inside without hesitation.

Chai Xueming and the others exchanged glances, then moved swiftly into the cave entrance. Obviously, they did not want to be burdened by Luo Tian, whom they considered a liability.

Luo Tian chuckled lightly and his body became a blur, vanishing from everyone's sight instantly.

"Fast! How come this Body Tempering Stage eighth-level youth is so much faster than others?" A disciple of the Water Source Sect muttered in admiration.

"Yes, he's so fast. If he were to ambush me, I wouldn't react in time. Is he really only at Body Tempering Stage Eight?" Another disciple of the Water Source Sect, also at Body Tempering Stage Eight, sighed in admiration.

After everyone had entered the cave, the Grand Elder clapped his hands. The whisk in the sky slowly returned to his hand. At the same time, the formation covering the cave entrance closed again.

"Disciples of the Water Source Sect! Anyone who dares to enter within five miles of this cave, and refuses to heed advice, shall be killed without mercy!" The Grand Elder's cold voice echoed.

After the Grand Elder's command, the disciples of the Water Source Sect moved into action. They scattered in groups to all directions.

...

Luo Tian was slightly late, but as soon as he entered the cave, he was engulfed by darkness.

Instinctively, he extended his spiritual sense and found no one nearby. Before he could withdraw it, a powerful pulling force dragged him in.

Luo Tian was familiar with this feeling. He had been transported to the depths of Dian Forest by Long Jian before, but this cave's transportation force was much more brutal.

A heart-wrenching pain formed on Luo Tian, and after a dizzy spell, he fell onto the ground.

Feeling the solid ground beneath him, Luo Tian patted his head, which felt heavy. He looked around.

Luo Tian found himself in an open space stretching endlessly. He extended his spiritual sense, but still could not see the horizon. Mountains and forests were present, yet it was clearly not a cave but much larger than that mountain.

"Unknown what the others' experiences were!"

Luo Tian muttered quietly and walked aimlessly forward.

Although Chen Changsheng had entered the cave first, his experience was similar to Luo Tian's. In fact, it was even more painful than Luo Tian's because their physical bodies were not as strong as Luo Tian's. Thus, they endured more pain.

Fifteen people wandered aimlessly in this open space.

"Little ones! Although I don't know how you entered, being here is your opportunity. If you truly pass the test, a great opportunity awaits you!" A voice filled with mockery echoed in everyone's ears.

"Boom..." At the same time, the scenery changed. The towering mountains and forests disappeared, and a golden tower rose from the ground, standing before everyone's eyes.

Luo Tian gazed at the towering golden tower and sighed in admiration. The Zhen Hun Ding in his storage ring emitted a heavy hum, as if it had met an old friend.

"Hmm?" Sensing Zhen Hun Ding's reaction, Luo Tian's face slightly changed. Since obtaining the Zhen Hun Ding, it had acted like a master. Now that this golden tower appeared, it reacted.

Others also looked at the tower with intense eyes, their faces showing strong greed.

"Alright, tell us your purpose for this journey. The first trial is to see who can reach the tower's front and pass it."

"So simple?" Everyone showed disbelief.

"You must be thinking this is too easy, but I can tell you it's really that simple! Ha ha. I hope you still say this after a day! Alright, run, little ones!" The voice ended without further sound.

Everyone stared at the golden tower reaching for the sky, their eyes burning with desire. They pushed off the ground with all their strength, trying to maximize their speed. They didn't know how fast others were, so they pushed themselves to the limit, rushing toward the tower.

Luo Tian did the same. He couldn't find any problems in this, but as soon as he ran into a forest, he discovered the issue.

He was surprised to find that when running, his spiritual energy wasn't replenished by the Five Elements Transformation Art.

He stopped and carefully felt. His face darkened. Perhaps he was too tense to notice the space's peculiarities, but now that he had calmed down, he finally discovered the problem.

"No spiritual energy!" The fifteen people were not foolish. They all stopped, realizing the space's issue and their faces showed bitterness.

Spiritual energy was like food and water for cultivators. Without it, they were only stronger than ordinary people, and could not use powerful martial arts.

Everyone stopped moving forward. They dared not continue using spiritual energy, relying instead on their physical strength to walk.

"Without spiritual energy? Then my advantage is huge!" Luo Tian smiled.

He had already transformed his body into Bone Forging, making his physical strength far superior to others. Also, his spiritual sense was an important attack and survival tool, something others didn't have.

He looked at the distance to the tower. Everyone's faces showed bitterness. In the past, this distance would take only half a day to reach, but now they had to walk step by step.

Although this didn't consume spiritual energy, remember that they hadn't eaten much before and relied on spiritual energy to sustain themselves. Now they had to find food by themselves, which was a torment for them.

They were all used to being served in their sects. They had never known how to cook or eat!

Luo Tian guessed others' situations were similar, so he wasn't too worried. After passing through a long forest, using his physical advantage, he caught a wild chicken and built a fire to cook dinner.

Chapter 199: Black-Cloaked Woman

Chapter 199: Black-Cloaked Woman

Luo Tian looked at the roasted chicken, his face showing a hint of nostalgia. He thought of a woman in his memories, Chen Yunting.

Back when he was an assistant at Feiyun Sect, he often took Chen Yunting to the back mountain to catch wild game. So, Luo Tian was quite skilled at this and easily caught a chicken in the forest, then started roasting it.

Several months ago, when Luo Tian paid respects to Chen Yunting and sorted through her belongings, he found the tools he had used before. Even the seasonings hadn't been discarded.

Sizzle, sizzle—The chicken emitted a continuous sound. Luo Tian skillfully sprinkled the seasoning evenly over the oily chicken, releasing an aromatic scent.

"Yunting. One day I will break through to the peak of martial arts and revive you! Even if you've entered reincarnation, I'll find you to say sorry!" Luo Tian muttered quietly.

"Drink..." The sound of fighting entered Luo Tian's ears.

Luo Tian didn't extend his spiritual sense because if he could hear it, it wasn't far. Also, Luo Tian felt that the fighting sound was getting closer.

Luo Tian didn't care. He was confident against anyone left. Especially without spiritual energy, he was definitely the strongest among them. So he ignored the fighting sound and focused on turning the chicken.

But fate was against him. Perhaps because of the fire smoke, the fighters seemed to be attracted and the fighting sound got closer.

His brows slightly furrowed. Luo Tian packed up his chicken.

"Don't let her escape..." A noisy voice came from the forest.

Luo Tian felt a woman's fragrance in his nose. A black figure ran to his front, her face obscured by a veil.

Luo Tian's eyes showed interest. This attire was familiar to him—exactly one of the four figures that Tu Yu Zheng had invited. However, he hadn't expected there was also a woman among them.

"Here she is!" Before Luo Tian could recover, more than ten figures rushed out of the forest. Seeing Luo Tian, they were momentarily stunned. Upon seeing the black figure, their faces showed anger.

Luo Tian saw the more than ten figures. His face slightly twitched. These people's clothing and appearance were strange, all wearing animal skins with strange tiger head tattoos on their chests.

"Are there others here?" Luo Tian's face showed confusion. He couldn't recognize these people wearing animal skins.

"Are you his accomplice?" Before Luo Tian could speak, the leader of a man in his thirties asked.

"Yes!"

"No!" A male and female voice spoke simultaneously.

The male's voice was Luo Tian's. The female's voice came from the veiled woman.

Upon hearing the woman's words, Luo Tian's eyes turned cold. She clearly wanted to use him as a shield, which made him angry.

"Your clothes are similar. You must be accomplices. He went to steal, and you were here to cover for him. The fire is already lit!" The leader shouted.

"Capture her! Capture her!" The men's companions all raised their weapons and shouted loudly.

"Capture!" Upon the leader's command, more than ten people rushed at Luo Tian like tigers.

The veiled woman showed a hint of brightness, blinking at Luo Tian. Her expression was one of triumph, no longer showing the cold and ominous aura she had outside the cave.

Before Luo Tian could comment on how quickly this woman changed her expression, a thick stick smashed down onto his head.

Luo Tian's eyes showed surprise. He didn't use spiritual energy and punched the stick directly.

"Boom..." Luo Tian felt a numbness in his hand, becoming more surprised.

"Such great strength!" His current body was at Bone Forging Stage. This stick could still make him feel pain, showing how strong this person was.

Seeing Luo Tian punch the stick away, the veiled woman showed shock. She had just experienced the stick's terrifying attack. That attack was comparable to a Bone Forging Stage Nine attack. Yet this boy at only Body Tempering Stage Eight had blocked it.

"What is this boy's body made of!" The woman couldn't help but exclaim.

As the woman marveled, Luo Tian fought with these more than ten people. The sound of impact echoed in the small forest.

The woman was increasingly amazed at Luo Tian's strong body. She couldn't understand how this seemingly weak body could be so resilient.

Although Luo Tian's body was at Bone Forging Stage, he still got hit by many sticks. His body showed bruises.

Luo Tian also marveled at these people's physical strength and power, which were much stronger than Bone Forging Stage Nine. His punches landed solidly, but these people only showed bruises.

At the same time, Luo Tian was also annoyed. He just wanted to eat a chicken quietly but got involved in this trouble. These people were too straightforward, only attacking him.

Looking at the veiled woman resting, Luo Tian felt a surge of anger. His punches became slightly harder.

"Boom... Boom..." The heavy sound echoed repeatedly, and the people wearing animal skins who had attacked Luo Tian fell to the ground.

"Boom..." He also knocked the leader flying. Luo Tian took a deep breath.

He turned around, his eyes flashing coldly, and walked toward the woman.

Seeing Luo Tian approaching her, the woman's eyes flashed with fear. But it was only a momentary flicker before disappearing. Her eyes were cold as she looked at Luo Tian.

Ignoring the taboo of men and women not touching, Luo Tian's big hand grabbed her neck to lift her.

The woman had just regained some strength and quickly stepped back, trying to dodge Luo Tian's big hand. But she couldn't escape. She had only taken a step back, and Luo Tian's big hand was already at her front.

It was just this one step that made the hand, which should have grabbed her neck, slightly shift downward.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian felt a softness in his hands. A pleasant feeling arose from his heart, and he gently rubbed it.

"Ah..." A sharp female voice pulled Luo Tian back to reality.

Luo Tian stared at his hands, his face instinctively turning red. He mentally cursed himself.

Chapter 200: Eat

Chapter 200: Eat

"I'll kill you!" The woman's cold voice echoed again.

Luo Tian was still regretting his action when a black figure suddenly appeared beside him. Like a black leopard, she punched his stomach.

"Boom..." Luo Tian hadn't expected this woman to be so desperate. She hadn't used spiritual energy when being chased, but now she had used her precious spiritual energy against him.

Luo Tian was knocked back, breaking several trees before stopping.

"Cough... Cough..." Luo Tian spat out two mouthfuls of blood and stood up.

The people who had previously chased the woman, looking at this woman, were shocked. They couldn't understand why she could suddenly unleash such a powerful force.

At the same time, they secretly guessed what kind of mistake this partner had made with her to make her so angry. Some of them naturally saw the scene, but in their view, it was quite normal. They often did this with their wives.

The black-cloaked woman, seeing that Luo Tian had only coughed up some blood and was otherwise fine, summoned her spiritual energy. Her figure appeared before Luo Tian again with strong elasticity. Her long legs kicked toward his back.

Luo Tian, knowing he was at fault, could only let her attack. He felt the strong wave on his back and smiled slightly. If she had landed that kick, he wouldn't just have coughed up blood.

While thinking, the woman's foot landed on Luo Tian's back.

"Boom..." The heavy sound echoed again.

A human-shaped imprint formed under the woman's foot.

The woman took a breath, her anger slightly subsiding. She looked at Luo Tian lying spread-eagled on the ground. Her eyes flashed with fierce intent. Since childhood, no man had touched her hand except for her father. She never expected this man to have taken such advantage of her.

The people around who wore animal skins, seeing the woman's fierce strength, thought she was so strong. The man who had beaten them wasn't even her opponent. They all dared not stand up.

"Pu..." Luo Tian lifted his face, spitting out some dirt. He looked at the woman.

"Enough! If you keep hitting me, I'll fight back!" Luo Tian said with a bitter smile.

"Not enough!" The woman said. She had, in her hand, a long sword that glowed with a cold light.

"Hey, are you serious? I'll fight back for real!" Luo Tian's face turned slightly dark.

This sword was definitely not a low-grade item. It could definitely injure him. Although he felt guilty, if it really cost him his life, then his life was too cheap.

A humming sound echoed. The sword rushed toward Luo Tian's chest.

Luo Tian didn't dare to be careless. He slightly summoned spiritual energy to his feet and continuously dodged, starting a chase with the woman in the forest.

After half an hour, the woman finally felt reluctant to waste spiritual energy. She knew she couldn't catch Luo Tian. If this continued, it would be a battle of spiritual energy strength.

During the chase, the woman was slightly surprised. If it were an ordinary Body Tempering Stage Eight person, he wouldn't have lasted this long under her attack. But now it seemed the boy hadn't used much spiritual energy.

"Stop chasing?" Luo Tian was also uncomfortable. Letting her waste one-tenth of his spiritual energy made him feel annoyed.

"Eventually, I'll kill you!" The woman's cold voice echoed.

"Why don't we make a temporary truce? Look, this place is so dangerous. Let's team up, okay?" Luo Tian didn't know if everyone had been scattered to a place. At the moment, he only saw this woman.

The woman remained silent, thinking over Luo Tian's words.

"Hey, come here!" Luo Tian pointed at the man who seemed to be the leader of the animal skin-wearing people and whispered.

Seeing Luo Tian call him, the man didn't dare to be careless. His eyes showed respect. Luo Tian's strength had exceeded his imagination. They were a people who respected strong individuals.

"Master, what are your commands?" The middle-aged man walked toward Luo Tian and punched his shoulder with one hand.

This was the highest respect of their tribe for someone they admired. However, Luo Tian didn't understand these things well. He pointed at the woman and asked: "What's your name? Why did she steal from you? Why do you chase her?"

Hearing Luo Tian's question, the middle-aged man and his people looked at the woman with strange expressions.

The woman's face turned hot. However, her face was covered by a veil. If it weren't for the veil, Luo Tian would have seen her face turning red.

"Respected strength, I am Hu Xiu Cheng. This lady stole some food from our tribe!" Hu Xiu Cheng's face showed a hint of confusion. He didn't know why this strong woman would steal from their tribe.

"Cough... Cough..." Luo Tian looked at the woman with a playful expression, smiling slightly.

"Smile what smile!" The cold voice came from the woman. However, Luo Tian could hear a hint of embarrassment in her voice.

"Ah, it's normal. Hunger is something everyone experiences!" Luo Tian took out the roasted chicken he had just made from his storage ring and offered it to the woman.

"Gurgle..." A strange sound came from the woman's body, making Luo Tian laugh uncontrollably.

The black-cloaked woman had used spiritual energy to attack Luo Tian, but now they weren't fighting. Naturally, she couldn't waste spiritual energy. The hunger that had disappeared for an hour returned to her body.

"Take it and eat!" Storage rings were indeed magical. After an hour, the chicken still emitted heat.

Smelling the aroma of the roasted chicken, the woman's hand seemed to move on its own and took it. She lifted her veil slightly, revealing a cherry-like mouth. Under Luo Tian's gaze, she opened her mouth and started eating.

The chicken had just entered her mouth. Perhaps she hadn't eaten for a long time, or it was because of hunger. It felt like the most delicious thing in the world. She started eating without regard for her image.

"Cough..." Within a quarter of an hour, the chicken was completely devoured, leaving only bones.

Luo Tian and Hu Xiu Cheng stared in amazement at the black-cloaked woman. They couldn't imagine how hungry she must have been to finish a chicken so quickly.

"Say no, but your body is honest!" Luo Tian smiled lightly.

Chapter 201: Tiger Clan

Chapter 201: Tiger Clan

Hearing Luo Tian's joke, the black-cloaked woman lowered her veil again, saying coldly: "For now, I won't kill you. But that doesn't mean we are friends! If provoked, we'll fight to the death. Don't test my limits!"

Luo Tian's lips slightly curled, and he said softly: "Since we are allies, let's introduce ourselves. I'm Luo Tian. The Northern Domain's Five Elements Sect should be familiar with it!"

"Are you Luo Tian?" The black-cloaked woman asked softly, her voice filled with strong disbelief.

From their previous fight, the black-cloaked woman knew Luo Tian's body was very strong. His spiritual energy was also much stronger than an ordinary Body Tempering Stage person. However, thinking about the fact that before in the cave's exterior, Luo Tian had only been at Body Tempering Stage Eight, she was still doubtful.

Due to her identity, the black-cloaked woman had heard of events in the Southern Domain's Yellowness Sect. She knew that Yellowness Sect's Shangguan Hongtu had died at the hands of a man named Luo Tian. She couldn't connect this seemingly harmless youth with that person who had killed Shangguan Hongtu.

"Without a doubt!" Luo Tian shrugged, not giving much explanation.

"Cold Qiu Chan!" The black-cloaked woman said her name coldly.

"Indeed, it's like her name!" Luo Tian curled his lips and sighed inwardly but didn't say it out loud. He didn't know what reaction this woman would have if he said it.

"Hu Xiu Cheng. Since she didn't succeed in stealing food, why do you chase her so much?" Luo Tian turned to Hu Xiu Cheng and whispered.

"Yes! It was our tribe's mistake. To express our apology, I would like to invite the two of you to visit our tribe! Hope that the two respected strength can allow us to make amends for this misunderstanding!" Hu Xiu Cheng punched his shoulder again and bowed slightly.

Luo Tian and Cold Qiu Chan exchanged glances, both nodding. Obviously, they weren't very familiar with this place. The best situation at the moment was to follow Hu Xiu Cheng and understand what this place was like by interacting with its native people, then proceed to the tower more carefully.

"Then I'll trouble you!"

Luo Tian bowed respectfully.

"It's our tribe's honor to host two strong individuals!" Hu Xiu Cheng and his group showed surprised expressions.

They led Luo Tian and Cold Qiu Chan like stars surrounding the moon, walking towards the forest's edge.

After about half an hour of walking, they arrived at a place resembling a tribe. During the journey, Hu Xiu Cheng also explained to Luo Tian about their tribe's general situation.

Luo Tian and Cold Qiu Chan slightly understood what this world was like.

It turned out that Hu Xiu Cheng's tribe was called the Tiger Clan. Most people had the surname Hu, and they worshipped the Tiger God, worshiping tigers as their faith. Tigers were their belief.

Also nearby were several tribes that worshipped other fierce beasts, with strength comparable to the Tiger Clan. These tribes had some friction but only minor conflicts. Because of the harsh conditions, tribe members mainly relied on hunting and farming.

Hearing Hu Xiu Cheng's explanation, Cold Qiu Chan's eyes showed a hint of longing. This peaceful life was something she had never experienced in her entire life.

Hu Xiu Cheng obviously held a high position within the tribe. As soon as they entered, people kept greeting him. Hu Xiu Cheng also greeted his tribespeople warmly.

At the same time, Hu Xiu Cheng introduced Luo Tian and Cold Qiu Chan to his tribespeople. Upon hearing how strong they were, the Tiger Clan people all looked at Luo Tian and Cold Qiu Chan with respect.

That night, Luo Tian and Cold Qiu Chan were treated with the highest standards by the Tiger Clan. They felt a different atmosphere.

The fire burned fiercely, and young men and women of the Tiger Clan danced around it. Luo Tian and Cold Qiu Chan were warmly pulled into the circle.

Luo Tian's mood was incredibly open, as if he had been cleansed by this primitive atmosphere.

To Luo Tian's surprise, Cold Qiu Chan, who was as cold as ice, also融入 into this atmosphere.

Late at night, the crowd dispersed. A full moon hung in the sky, and the entire Tiger Clan fell into peace.
