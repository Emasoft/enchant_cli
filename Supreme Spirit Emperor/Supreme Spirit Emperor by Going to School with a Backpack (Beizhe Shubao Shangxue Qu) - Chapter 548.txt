“Very well, I’ll make Luo Tian crawl back!” Zhang Tiantian hurriedly bowed to the crowd.

“Remember, you have only one quarter of an hour. If you fail, we’ll have no choice but to abandon the plan. And ensure Luo Tian is first—should he not be, none of us can bear the consequences!” Over thirty people simultaneously warned Zhang Tiantian.

Chapter 2095: Zhang Tiantian’s Revenge

“Understood!” Zhang Tiantian nodded, his eyes gleaming with a hint of amusement. A quarter of an hour was more than enough for him. Though Luo Tian’s strength had been formidable, Zhang Tiantian harbored his own confidence. If not for that black dog, Luo Tian would have been trapped in the twenty-second layer.

Luo Tian strolled leisurely through the barrier, and the thirty-six figures dared not obstruct him. Even their fear of Luo Tian summoning his dog made them pray silently.

Time passed slowly, layer after layer of barriers crumbling like paper beneath Luo Tian’s passage. At last, he breached the thirty-fifth barrier and stood before the thirty-sixth. Once he shattered this final barrier, the trial would end.

“Truly refreshing,” Luo Tian sighed deeply, though he had encountered minor obstacles—trivial matters to him.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian prepared to step beyond the black barrier, a tremor surged from the final layer. Black mist coiled upward, forming a face—Zhang Tiantian’s.

“Do you think leaving so soon is wise?” Zhang Tiantian smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

“Indeed, it’s rather dull. Being invincible is lonely,” Luo Tian replied with a grin upon seeing Zhang Tiantian’s face.

“Erhei, devour this barrier!” Luo Tian waved his hand, and the black dog materialized beside him.

“Impudent!” The three dozen figures atop the altar trembled, and Zhang Tiantian leapt off the platform.

Black mist surged; Zhang Tiantian’s face broke free from the barrier, as if draining it. His figure emerged before Luo Tian.

With Zhang Tiantian’s arrival, the black barrier turned nearly transparent.

“I knew it was you. I never thought your heart was so small!” Luo Tian observed Zhang Tiantian without surprise.

“Back then in the Luo family, I couldn’t touch you. Here, I’ll repay every humiliation you gave me—make you crawl out of this hall!” Zhang Tiantian’s face was cold as he transformed into a black eagle, soaring toward Luo Tian.

“Here too, you can’t touch me!” Luo Tian sneered, his foot striking the ground. He became a streak of black light, charging toward Zhang Tiantian without fear.

“Crack!” The crisp sound echoed between the barriers as their figures collided, then recoiled.

“Cough…!” Luo Tian spat blood, his eyes darkening with resolve. Zhang Tiantian, though also thrown back, bore no injuries—only a dizzying sensation.

“You’re strong, kid, but you’re nothing before me!” Zhang Tiantian took a step forward, lunging again.

“Is this your flesh?” Luo Tian’s battle spirit flared. He realized the reason—Zhang Tiantian’s aura mirrored Luo Bai’s. His body could fight True Immortal Intermediate; Zhang Tiantian was no match. Clearly, the hall’s barrier had granted Zhang Tiantian an advantage.

“Not bad for a brain,” Zhang Tiantian grunted, his fist colliding with Luo Tian’s. Again, Luo Tian was thrown back, blood spewing from his mouth.

“What good is an advantage? I don’t believe it has limits!” Luo Tian wiped his lips, spitting out black runes. They enveloped him, amplifying his aura—his ultimate technique, *The Battle Song of the Divine Beast*.

With a thunderous punch, three shadowy fists converged, colliding with Zhang Tiantian’s. The earth-shaking roar echoed between the barriers, shaking their very foundations.

Zhang Tiantian steadied himself, his qi trembling. He gazed at Luo Tian, who now appeared far stronger. A flicker of surprise crossed his eyes.

“Even with the barrier’s blessing, Zhang Tiantian couldn’t subdue him!”

“This man definitely deserves entry into the Reincarnation Hall!” Thirty-five Reincarnation Hall disciples gaped. They knew Zhang Tiantian’s strength with the barrier’s blessing—True Immortal Intermediate would fall to him. Yet this Luo Tian had clashed with Zhang Tiantian thrice, spitting only a little blood. This earned them his respect, elevating him to their level.

“Again!” Luo Tian laughed, activating *King’s Combat Technique* and *Yin Shadow Steps*. His speed reached its peak, becoming a blur that vanished from sight.

“Fear me?” Zhang Tiantian roared, his madness rising. He felt humiliated—despite the barrier’s blessing, he couldn’t subdue Luo Tian.

*Boom…* The two clashed within the barrier, their thunderous roars echoing endlessly. Each clash left fine cracks in the collision zone. Their speed was blinding; even the thirty-five figures could only see fleeting shadows, unable to discern their movements. Blood splattered onto the ground.

“This Luo Tian is formidable. If it were a one-on-one fight, we might not match him. But with the barrier’s blessing, we can definitely suppress him.”

“But Zhang Tiantian has a time limit—quarter of an hour. If he fails to subdue Luo Tian, his plan is doomed,” people murmured.

Time passed; half a incense stick had elapsed. Zhang Tiantian’s heart grew anxious.

“This body is too变态!” Zhang Tiantian marveled, his back retreating as his arms trembled. His lips bled.

“Come on, Zhang Tiantian! Have the guts to kill me today!”

“If you don’t kill me, once I enter the Reincarnation Hall, I’ll beat you so badly you won’t recognize your mother!”

“I don’t believe entering the Reincarnation Hall means you still have this barrier’s blessing!” Luo Tian, riddled with wounds and bloodstained, laughed wildly.

“Hum…” Zhang Tiantian’s face darkened. He grabbed a black long sword, its aura exploding.

“Destroy him. If he enters the Reincarnation Hall unscathed, his talent will surpass mine. Then what he said might come true!” Zhang Tiantian’s mind whispered, his black sword radiating overwhelming power.

“Swish…” The sword slashed, a hundred-foot blade forming a crescent moon, slicing toward Luo Tian.

The immense pressure overwhelmed Luo Tian. Zhang Tiantian’s strength was indeed greater, but Luo Tian remained confident. He had used secret techniques before, knowing their drawbacks—short-lived power boosts. Though Zhang Tiantian was blessed by the barrier, it wasn’t much different from a secret technique.

The *Dragon Soaring Sword* materialized in Luo Tian’s hand, its blade clashing with Zhang Tiantian’s.

“Crash…” Luo Tian was thrown back again, his sword trembling.

“An upper-tier ghostly artifact!”

“I didn’t expect such a surprise!” Zhang Tiantian gazed at Luo Tian’s sword, his eyes gleaming. His own long sword was a middle-tier ghostly artifact—blessed, temporarily wielding upper-tier divine weapon power.

Luo Tian said nothing, instead grabbing his hand. A black claw tore from the void, appearing above their heads. The overwhelming aura made Zhang Tiantian solemn.

“Cut the Yellow River!” Zhang Tiantian roared, his sword expanding again. He wielded it with both hands, slicing toward the black claw.

“Stop!” Luo Tian pressed his hand forward, an invisible wave emanating from it. It struck the expanding blade.

“Damn!” Zhang Tiantian’s face darkened. His sword felt as if gripped by a giant hand, though only for an instant. The black claw descended, piercing Zhang Tiantian’s body. Simultaneously, his sword struck the claw.

The claw shattered, and the powerful shockwave sent Zhang Tiantian flying backward, colliding with the barrier.

On the altar, thirty-five figures fell silent, staring at Zhang Tiantian with four blood holes. They hadn’t expected this outcome.

As the two clashed, less than a few breaths remained of the quarter-hour. Luo Tian stood pale, his soul drained by the *Eight Directions Soul-Stealing Technique*. Zhang Tiantian’s attack had been too strong.

“Chen Senior Brother, lend me your barrier power. Once out, I’ll surely reward you!” Zhang Tiantian stood up, shouting. He hadn’t anticipated Luo Tian being so tenacious, but now he was desperate.

“Good!” A figure on the altar stood, pressing a seal onto the altar.

The three currently assaulting the twenty-sixth barrier felt their front barrier weaken instantly. Their attacks pierced through it.

“What’s happening?” They didn’t hesitate, rushing into the barrier toward the twenty-seventh.

“A quarter-hour? I’ll see how many you have!” Luo Tian’s face curled into a sneer, gazing at Zhang Tiantian, now back to his peak.

Chapter 2096: I Haven’t Entered Yet

The thunderous clashes continued, Zhang Tiantian bleeding profusely, his mind frantic. The Reincarnation Hall disciples were even more awestruck.

“This kid—what is he made of? He’s still standing!” Watching Luo Tian clash with Zhang Tiantian, the quarter-hour felt neither long nor short. Yet their relentless battles saw Luo Tian as if indestructible, spitting blood but enduring.

“Again!”

“Is that all you’ve got?” Luo Tian spat blood, smiling as he gazed at Zhang Tiantian’s waning aura.

At this moment, Luo Tian was in dire condition, but he had discerned Zhang Tiantian’s limits. He had endured all of Zhang Tiantian’s techniques.

“Zhao Senior Brother, lend me your barrier power!” Zhang Tiantian roared, his voice wild.

A youth sat cross-legged, frowning. Wang Lie and others had already breached the twenty-ninth layer; if he lent Zhang Tiantian more power, it would cost him another. Yet he stood slowly, pressing a seal onto the altar. Zhang Tiantian’s aura surged again.

“Haha, thirty barriers! That Luo Tian must be hindered by something!”

“I still have a chance!” Wang Lie laughed, gazing at the transparent barrier. He punched it, his eyes weary.

“I’ll see how long you can endure!” Zhang Tiantian’s face twisted with menace, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Try it!”

“But I think this is the end! Your borrowed power won’t help!” Luo Tian smiled, his sword raised. Black light surged, filling the space. The immense pressure made Zhang Tiantian struggle to breathe.

“Luo Tian is exhausted, it seems he’s ready to fight for his life. He knows continuing will mean Zhang Tiantian has near-limitless blessings!” The altar’s figures watched Luo Tian, his bloodstained robes fluttering.

“Then let’s settle this!” Zhang Tiantian’s face twisted with menace, gazing at Luo Tian’s overwhelming aura.

“Two Senior Brothers, lend me your barrier power!” Zhang Tiantian shouted, his eyes wild.

“Good!” Two more stood, pressing seals onto the altar. Zhang Tiantian’s aura surged again, surpassing True Immortal Intermediate and nearing True Immortal Late.

“Boom…” Black mist churned; Zhang Tiantian howled, his body seeming on the verge of explosion. Cracks formed across his skin, emitting a crackling sound.

“Thirty-two… thirty-three… three more barriers, and I’ll break through the thirty-sixth! I’ll be first in this trial!”

“No matter what hinders Luo Tian, hold on! If I’m first, I’ll surely reward you after exiting!” Wang Lie roared, shattering the transparent barrier.

Yan Shu and Chen Tianzhou were equally elated, smashing their way toward the thirty-fourth barrier.

“Make it open!” Wang Lie’s body seemed mad, a black ghostly sword materializing in his hand. He slashed toward the thirty-fourth barrier.

Yan Shu and Chen Tianzhou also unleashed their power, no longer holding back. Their auras surged as they smashed the barrier.

Others in the trial also relentlessly attacked. People began to realize Luo Tian wasn’t as fast as expected to reach the thirty-sixth layer.

“Sword of Immortal Ascension!”

“Cut the Yellow River!” As everyone fought to break barriers, Luo Tian and Zhang Tiantian shouted in unison.

Two black divine beams shot from their hands, a sword and a blade colliding toward each other.

*Boom…* The earth-shaking roar echoed between the barriers, True Immortal power swirling. The transparent barrier swelled violently, as if about to burst.

“Who won?” On the altar, thirty-five figures stood, gazing at the curtain. Their spiritual senses couldn’t escape; they could only see thick black mist.

After nearly half a quarter-hour, the black mist finally dissipated. The transparent barrier remained unbroken.

The black mist in the thirty-fifth barrier had also lessened, clearly weakened by the collision. Two figures stood there, gazing at each other without attacking. Both were in terrible condition, trembling violently.

“Wang Senior Brother, lend me your barrier power!” Zhang Tiantian spoke, his voice barely a whisper. Yet his face was filled with excitement—he knew Luo Tian’s state. If he received another blessing, he’d crush Luo Tian.

“Impossible!” The thirty-five figures sighed deeply on the altar, gazing at the curtain. At this moment, Wang Lie, Yan Shu, and Chen Tianzhou had broken through the thirty-fourth barrier, entering the thirty-fifth.

“Luo Tian!” Wang Lie and others stood outside the barrier, seeing Luo Tian by it.

At this moment, Wang Lie’s group was within three feet of Luo Tian. If they broke the barrier, they’d see him.

“Damn!” Zhang Tiantian’s face paled. He hadn’t received the blessing, and he heard the thunderous sounds of Wang Lie’s group breaking the thirty-fifth barrier.

“It seems you’ll be lying here!”

“You’re such a waste! I helped you so much, yet you still didn’t make me crawl out!” Luo Tian’s mocking laughter made Zhang Tiantian’s heart tremble.

Luo Tian stepped forward, each step hammering into Zhang Tiantian’s heart.

“This kid’s body is stronger than Zhang Tiantian’s!”

“Prepare, it’s about to end!” The thirty-five figures on the altar shook their heads. They knew Zhang Tiantian had no chance now; they couldn’t abandon the Reincarnation Hall’s mission for him.

“Can you still hit me?” Luo Tian walked a while, approaching Zhang Tiantian. His blood-stained palm swung toward him.

Zhang Tiantian stood there, trying to raise his hand to block—but he had no strength. He could barely stand, watching Luo Tian’s palm descend.

“Smack…” The slap nearly shattered Zhang Tiantian’s head, sending him flying like a kite. He landed on the ground.

“They didn’t expect Luo Tian to keep fighting instead of exiting the barrier!” The thirty-five figures gasped.

“He’s approaching Zhang Tiantian again!”

“Retrieve Zhang Tiantian; if he keeps fighting, he might die!” The thirty-five figures couldn’t stay calm. They pressed seals onto the altar.

Black seals glowed, appearing in the sky. They lifted Zhang Tiantian, who had been knocked unconscious by Luo Tian’s slap, vanishing from his sight.

Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with weakness. He gazed at the hall’s ceiling, smiling before walking toward the transparent barrier.

“End!” The thirty-five figures sighed deeply. Though it had been tense, the outcome remained unchanged.

“Damn…” But as the thirty-five figures relaxed, Luo Tian approached the transparent barrier but didn’t exit. Instead, he sat cross-legged on the ground to recover.

“He tricked me—I haven’t even left yet!” Luo Tian’s inner voice sneered. He was indeed at his limit, but he was furious and wouldn’t let them feel comfortable.

“They must be thinking he’s recovering to exit with full strength!” The thirty-five figures guessed Luo Tian. After all, he was just one step from exiting the barrier. Once out, he’d leave the hall and appear before the Beast King’s crowd.

“Boom…” But as they guessed, a thunderous roar echoed within the barrier.

“Haha!” Wang Lie laughed, his face pale. He had paid a heavy price but finally broke through the thirty-fifth barrier.

“Luo Tian!” Wang Lie saw Luo Tian sitting there as he broke through, his face paling.

“Hello!” Luo Tian smiled at Wang Lie, but his eyes gazed toward the hall’s ceiling.

“What…?” Wang Lie was stunned, unsure why Luo Tian sat there. He didn’t dare move.

The thirty-five figures on the altar were equally stunned, unsure what Luo Tian was up to. Wang Lie had entered—why didn’t he exit?

“I’m injured and can’t stand!” Luo Tian smiled, making Wang Lie’s face light up.

“What?” Hearing this, Wang Lie didn’t hesitate. He leapt upward toward the transparent barrier. He was certain it wouldn’t withstand his strike.

“Damn!” The thirty-five figures’ faces darkened. A youth jumped from the altar, instantly appearing in Wang Lie’s path.

“Boom…” The youth struck a palm, blocking Wang Lie’s way.

“Who are you?”

“Move aside!” Wang Lie’s face shifted, striking a palm against the youth. His body turned but stopped immediately, then rushed toward the barrier again.

“Get out quickly!” The youth shouted at Luo Tian before blocking Wang Lie again.

“Tricked me? Today, I won’t let you bleed!” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the youth without moving.
