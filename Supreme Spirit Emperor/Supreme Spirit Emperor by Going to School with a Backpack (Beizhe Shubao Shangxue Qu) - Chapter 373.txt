“Wailing...” As Luo Tian and his companions gazed upon the grey mist, a mournful sound echoed into their ears, causing all faces to shift in expression.

“Again... every three days it happens. Today is the third day!” Their faces bore fear, eyes slightly unfocused.

“Rippling...” Under the wailing sound, the grey mist surged violently, rapidly spreading outward.

“Subdue!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cold light as he formed a hand seal, sending an invisible wave outward. Instantly, it surged into the bodies of those surrounding them.

After Luo Tian’s wave entered their bodies, their expressions gradually returned to normal, eyes regaining clarity.

“Flee! Don’t let the grey mist catch you!” They gazed at Luo Tian with gratitude, then shouted as they fled swiftly.

“Go!” Luo Tian exchanged a glance with Fu Xingyue and the others, his eyes showing concern. He then moved swiftly behind the crowd.

After fleeing over a hundred miles, the grey mist calmed, allowing everyone to exhale deeply.

“Each time this sound occurs, the mist expands a hundred miles. That’s why we summoned several royal clans—to prevent it from consuming all of the Mortal Domain. If that happens, we’ll have to abandon this place!” Their eyes turned toward Fu Xingyue and the others, hoping their arrival would resolve this issue.

“This is quite troublesome. I wonder how those others are doing!” Luo Tian and the others exchanged glances, but did not rush in. Though they carried Royal Armaments, they dared not be careless—this Mortal Domain was too strange.

As Luo Tian and the others pondered how to enter, a thunderous sound erupted from within the Mortal Domain. The grey mist roiled again, emitting an immense power wave.

“What’s happening? This is different from before! I’ve never felt such terrifying energy!” Their eyes turned toward the grey mist, filled with disbelief.

“Wavering...” A series of lights flickered within the grey mist, then rushed toward them. These lights radiated immense power, causing everyone to tremble instantly.

“This is the aura of an Epoch Realm master!” Luo Tian and Fu Xingyue’s eyes narrowed.

“Flee!” Fu Xingyue shouted at the crowd, knowing these ancient clans behind him could not withstand this power.

“Wavering...” Fu Xingyue raised his hand, and the Divine Diagram of Gods and Demons appeared above their heads. Black and white qi surged, enveloping them.

“Flee!” Hearing Fu Xingyue’s words, people scattered in all directions, streams of light flying outward.

“Plop…” Some were too slow and were struck by the power, turning into blood mist beneath the grey sky.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian ignored the fallen ancient clans, instead gazing at the grey mist with confusion.

Wind howled as several figures emerged from the grey mist, their forms battered and wounded.

“Tu Feiyang? Man Hun? Fan Jingyu?” Fu Xingyue and the others also looked puzzled, recognizing these figures.

“Fu Xingyue?” Seeing Fu Xingyue, they were momentarily stunned before their expressions darkened.

“Hey, you look so pitiful!” Fu Xingyang sneered, speaking loudly as he surveyed the battered figures.

They had previously planned to enter the Mortal Domain together, but due to Luo Tian’s interference, they had quarreled and decided to enter early. Now it seemed their situation within the Mortal Domain was dire.

“Fu Xingyue, you’re just in time! Let’s enter together—this will increase our chances. The Mortal Domain has changed; if we don’t handle it, we won’t be able to stay here!” Jin Ziyang addressed Fu Xingyue.

“We won’t go. You’re so strong, aren’t you?” Fu Xingyang knew they had to enter but couldn’t help mocking them.

“You…” Their anger flared toward Fu Xingyang, but they coldly replied: “This isn’t our problem. It’s the ancient clans’ issue, so whether we enter or not is up to you!”

“Tell us what’s happening inside,” Fu Xingyue frowned, his gaze serious. He knew Tu Feiyang’s strength; for them to be so battered, the Mortal Domain must be extraordinary.

Luo Tian stood behind them, his eyes tense as he watched Tu Feiyang’s group. His concern deepened—what were Gu Qianxue and Sun Mengru’s fates if they were truly here?

“Again, souls?” Luo Tian felt puzzled, his gaze heavy. Though he had instinctively sensed the connection between the Mortal Domain and souls, he hadn’t expected even Tu Feiyang’s group to be hindered so severely upon entry.

“Let’s go again; maybe it’s just two Epoch Realm souls at the perimeter!” Tu Feiyang said, his expression grave.

“Hmph,” Man Hun and the others nodded, unwilling to leave. After all, they were among the strongest in the ancient clans; even Epoch Realm and Provisional Kings couldn’t act, so they had to find a way to resolve the Mortal Domain crisis.

“However, why hasn’t the Death Clan come? They’re more skilled at dealing with souls. Also, the Mortal Domain was once occupied by their hidden forces—perhaps they know how to break this place!” Luo Tian asked, suspecting a connection between the Mortal Domain’s change and the Death Clan.

“Who are you?” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Tu Feiyang and the others frowned. To them, Luo Tian was merely a servant of Fu Xingyue’s—how could he speak with them?

“I am the Grand Commander of Star-Moon Guards!” Fu Xingyue replied softly, then addressed Luo Tian: “The Death Clan suffered heavy losses last time—two sons, one ancient king’s child, and an Epoch Realm master were killed. In the Mortal Domain, only two Epoch Realm masters remain; there’s no one truly formidable.”

Fu Xingyang’s eyes flickered oddly at Luo Tian. The deaths of these three top-tier figures were partly due to Luo Tian personally killing two, and another was slain by Luo Tian’s elder Gu Tian. Luo Tian should know this.

“Moreover, the Death Clan and our royal clans only cooperate during attacks on the Nine Domains. Our relationship isn’t great!” Fu Xingyue’s gaze was cold, recalling when he and his people were ambushed by the Death Clan’s masters upon returning from the蛮族 (Mán Zú).

“Never mind. Without the Death Clan, I don’t think we can’t enter! Fu Xingyue, did you bring the Royal Armaments?” Jin Ziyang asked, unwilling to waste words as the grey mist continued roiling.

“Yes,” Fu Xingyue replied without hesitation. Clearly, they needed the Royal Armaments to push deeper.

“If there are no more questions, let’s go in!” Tu Feiyang addressed Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang.

“Xuanshuan, go back. It’s too dangerous here; you mustn’t be harmed!” Fu Xingyue turned to Fu Xianshuan, who stood beside Luo Tian.

“Indeed, Xuanshuan, listen to your elder brother and go back! I’m speaking as your elder brother; you must obey!” Fu Xingyang added.

“Xuanshuan, they’re right. Go back!” Man Hun smiled awkwardly, addressing Fu Xianshuan.

“No, I must go in!” Fu Xianshuan shook her head gently, eyes resolute.

“Haha, Xuanshuan, you truly are the Emperor of Star-Moon Clan. Don’t worry; if there’s danger inside, Feiyang will protect you!” Tu Feiyang smiled, addressing Fu Xianshuan.

“Exactly! If you can’t even protect your own sister, you’re a coward!” Jin Ziyang sneered.

“You…” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang’s faces darkened, seeing the disdain in their eyes.

Luo Tian watched Jin Ziyang’s group coldly. Their intent was clear—they wanted Fu Xianshuan to enter, as she was the Emperor of Star-Moon Clan. If anything happened to her, it would be a major blow to the clan.

Or perhaps one of them truly wanted to protect Fu Xianshuan, but only to show off before her. If they won her heart, it would be a great gain. Except for the honest Man Hun, they all had selfish motives.

“Elder Brother, Second Elder Brother, don’t persuade me. I’ll obey you on everything else, but not this!” Fu Xianshuan firmly refused.

“Sigh…” Luo Tian sighed deeply. Normally, Fu Xianshuan’s strength was comparable to Tu Feiyang’s group; he didn’t want her to take the risk.

“Let’s go!” Tu Feiyang and the others showed impatience, urging them.

“Go!” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang sighed reluctantly, standing on either side of Fu Xianshuan. They joined the others as they rushed into the grey mist.

Luo Tian and the others didn’t pay much attention to them, as they were like cannon fodder. No need to care about them.

“Wavering…” A brilliant light flickered, and the Star-Moon Divine Spear hovered above their heads. Even the grey mist couldn’t block its dazzling light.

They stood beneath the Star-Moon Divine Spear, flying toward the grey land. Within a moment, they landed on the grey ground.

“Mortal Domain!” Luo Tian’s face changed instantly as he gazed at the grey earth, as if countless souls slumbered beneath it. The sight filled him with unease.

“Roar…” As they landed, a series of roars echoed in their ears. Soul forms surged from the ground, rushing toward Luo Tian’s group with snarls. Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang’s faces darkened.

“These souls… where are they from? Their wills were erased!” Fu Xingyang frowned, gazing at the soul forms filling the sky.

But with the Star-Moon Divine Spear, these willless souls seemed to fear it, not daring to approach Luo Tian’s group.

Luo Tian stood beneath the Star-Moon Divine Spear, his heart trembling. Why did he sense no hostility from these souls but instead a fervent zeal? This zeal was directed at himself.

“Soul-Subduing Master!” Luo Tian’s heart ached, but he didn’t act recklessly. He remained within the Star-Moon Divine Spear’s protection, waiting silently.

“Roar…” The roar echoed through the sky as powerful auras emerged from the Mortal Domain’s depths. Instantly, Fu Xingyue and the others’ faces changed.

“More!” Seeing these powerful auras approaching, Tu Feiyang’s group’s faces darkened.

To Luo Tian, these souls radiated fervor; to Tu Feiyang, they were terrifying. Especially the ones that had given them such immense pressure, making them fear deeply.

“How to break through? Let’s activate the Royal Armaments and eliminate these minor threats first; otherwise, we’ll have trouble facing those major ones!” Fu Xingyang spoke softly.

“Roar…” As they discussed, four powerful figures appeared before them.

These four formidable auras approached Luo Tian’s group, causing their faces to darken.

Their grey forms were as tall as mountains, with bull-like heads. As these four figures approached, the surrounding willless souls trembled, parting to let them through.

“Are these souls?” Fu Xingyue’s group looked surprised, feeling these beings weren’t like ordinary souls.

“We met two before. These seem solid but are seemingly immortal—techniques can wound them, but physical attacks are ineffective! Even my life-fire only caused injuries!” Jin Ziyang spoke softly, watching these four towering figures. He held a massive white bone club, swinging it fiercely at the Star-Moon Divine Spear’s group.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound shook Luo Tian’s group, causing their blood to stir.

“Damn it, activate it! We’ll have to face them eventually!” Tu Feiyang urged Fu Xingyue, his eyes anxious.

“Wavering…” As they were anxious, Luo Tian stood behind them, hands clasped in a seal. An invisible wave emerged from his hands, spreading beyond the Star-Moon Divine Spear’s protection and reaching these souls.

“Roar…” In an instant, the four figures that had given them immense pressure turned and retreated into the Mortal Domain’s depths.

The willless souls also sank gradually, sinking into the Mortal Domain’s ground.

“Useful!” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly. He now fully understood the power of a Soul-Subduing Master and the origin of these willless souls.

The Nine Domain Saints had repeatedly slaughtered people from the Nine Domains, converting their blood into vitality. However, souls were forcibly detained in the Mortal Domain, not entering reincarnation. They were mysteriously drawn into the Mortal Domain over time.

Years of mutual consumption accumulated, creating countless willless souls. As a ninth-generation Soul-Subduing Master, Luo Tian could restore these souls’ consciousness and guide them into true reincarnation. How could these willless souls not be frenzied?

“What’s happening?” Tu Feiyang and the others looked puzzled, also shocked. They hadn’t even acted yet, but these terrifying beings had retreated on their own, leaving them confused.

“Never mind. We’ve already entered; with the Royal Armaments, we might go further and explore this death trap. And since such changes have occurred, something must have changed in the Mortal Domain!” Tu Feiyang’s eyes gleamed. He felt his luck had returned—once inside the Mortal Domain, these souls had parted for him.

“Hmph,” everyone nodded, deciding to press deeper to uncover why these souls had suddenly appeared and why so many had erupted.

Without the endless souls, their vision was clearer, at least seeing a thousand zhang ahead.

The grey mist still lingered; in their view, a building appeared, but it was completely ruined. The entire world was grey, yet the Mortal Domain’s depths still gave a sense of unease.

They continued moving forward, stepping along a grey road toward the Mortal Domain’s depths.

“Where did those four terrifying beings go?” As they walked, no danger arose, so Tu Feiyang’s group gradually relaxed their vigilance, whispering to each other in hushed tones, fearing they might disturb the now-calmed souls.

“Don’t know. I think they received some command and returned to the Mortal Domain’s depths!” Jin Ziyang replied, but his gaze darkened.

“Boom…” As they walked, a series of thunderous sounds reached Luo Tian’s ears, causing their bodies to pause.

“There’s a battle aura!” Their minds were tense as they gazed into the grey mist, sensing several powerful auras.

“Is there someone else here?” They wondered, exchanging glances before advancing deeper into the Mortal Domain.

After walking dozens of miles, they finally found the source of the battle aura, their eyes filled with awe.

In their view stood four figures as tall as mountains, swinging bone clubs and attacking another colossal figure. The wild aura made Luo Tian’s group uneasy.

Four powerful souls attacked a soul shrouded in black mist, as if natural enemies. They roared constantly, striking the black soul.

The other figure was clearly much stronger than these four souls. A black soul knife formed in its hand, eyes glowing red with clarity. It clashed repeatedly with the four bull-headed souls.

“What should we do?” Seeing this, Fu Xingyue’s group exchanged glances, unsure of what to do. After all, both sides didn’t seem like good guys.

“Roar…” The four bull-headed souls noticed Luo Tian’s group and roared at them, their thoughts carrying a faint request.

“Are they asking for us?” Tu Feiyang spoke softly, understanding the four souls’ intent. He turned to Fu Xingyue’s group.

“Are they asking for me?” Luo Tian looked puzzled, gazing at the soul shrouded in black mist. His eyes glowed with light; he sensed an evil aura from it.

“Help! These bull-headed souls, although they attacked us earlier, eventually withdrew! And with these four here, our path ahead will be much easier!” Fu Xingyue spoke, moving toward the black soul.

“You… seek death!” The black soul looked at Fu Xingyue’s group, its low roar coming out in broken sentences.

“Just a soul! How arrogant!” Jin Ziyang’s face was cold as he spat out a golden fire dragon from his mouth, rushing toward the black soul.

“Wavering…” A blood-red spear emerged from Tu Feiyang’s hands, forming a streak of crimson light toward the black soul.

“Ah…” The black soul let out a long roar, its soul power spreading outward as if angered.

The four bull-headed souls, lacking consciousness, simply swung their white bone clubs at the black soul.

Mán Hun and others also launched attacks, light flashing as they unleashed powerful martial arts toward the black soul.

“Boom… Boom…” Each attack soared into the black soul, but it felt like hitting cotton, producing a dull sound. Black mist drifted from the black soul.

“Damn it! Martial arts have such little effect on him?” Fu Xingyue’s group changed faces, watching the black soul that had only lost some soul power.

“Roar…” The black soul then transformed into a massive black mouth, swallowing one of the bull-headed souls.

“Crack…” A crisp sound echoed; although the bull-headed soul lacked consciousness, it had a keen sense of danger. It retreated with a massive body, but its shoulder was torn off by the black mouth.

“Clang…” The white bone club clanged to the ground, producing a dull sound. The ground trembled three times from the impact of the bone club, kicking up dust.

“Roar…” As if provoked, the bull-headed soul let out a painful roar and bit at the black mouth.

The other three bull-headed souls then swung their bone clubs again, and on the clubs appeared waves of soul laws. Though simple, they radiated a terrifying aura as they swung at the black mouth.

“What should we do?” Fu Xingyue’s group frowned slightly; their attacks had been试探 (testing), yet they could have wounded an Epoch Realm late-stage soul. But the black soul only roared a few times.

“Martial arts are ineffective. I’ll try my life-fire!” Jin Ziyang sighed, thinking of no other option. He knew it would be the same as before because they had fought two bull-headed souls earlier, and his life-fire only caused them injuries, giving them time to escape.

“Epoch Realm masters are terrifying. I think this black soul is nearly at the Provisional King level; otherwise, it wouldn’t be so indifferent to our attacks. Also, it has consciousness!” Fu Xingyue’s eyes showed concern.

“Activate the Star-Moon Divine Spear and subdue it!” Fu Xingyang spoke next, since they had brought the Royal Armaments, they must use them.

“No, if we activate it, we might awaken something even more terrifying! This is our last resort!” Fu Xianshuan sighed softly.

“What should we do? Can’t we fight this black soul up close?” Tu Feiyang’s eyes showed helplessness.

“Roar…” As they discussed, the four bull-headed souls were broken by the black soul. They instinctively fought with the black soul, though it seemed no movement. However, Luo Tian’s group knew the danger; if they weren’t careful, these four top-tier bull-headed souls would be consumed.

“We can’t delay any longer; if these four bull-headed souls are devoured by that one, I suspect it will evolve into a Provisional King! Then we’ll have no chance at all!” Mán Hun spoke loudly, his voice filled with concern.

“This is just the beginning; we’ve already faced setbacks!” Fu Xingyue’s eyes showed a sigh.

“Rippling…” As they spoke, golden fire erupted from Jin Ziyang’s mouth. Then he spat out a stream of blood into the fire.

A terrifying temperature spread across the grey sky, and the fire had streaks of red, looking dazzling. Jin Ziyang’s face was pale; he extended his hand toward the battling black soul, and a golden fire dragon roared out, rushing toward it.

Faced with Jin Ziyang’s life-fire, the black soul finally changed. In the golden fire, it felt a threat and spat out dark mist, transforming into a black dragon that collided with the golden fire dragon.

Smoke rose as two long dragons, like enemies, collided. Though no thunderous sound, the collision was terrifying.

In just a moment, both dragons annihilated each other and vanished from Luo Tian’s group’s sight.

“This can also block it!” Seeing even Jin Ziyang’s life-fire was blocked, Fu Xingyue’s group’s faces darkened further.

“Soul-Subduing Master, go check if your body can harm it!” Tu Feiyang coldly spoke, gazing at Luo Tian behind them.

“Tu Feiyang, what do you mean!” Hearing Tu Feiyang’s words, Fu Xingyue and the others turned angry, gazing at Tu Feiyang.

“Fu Xingyue, don’t be angry. You brought him here to act as cannon fodder, right? Now that martial arts are ineffective against this one, only your body can try!” Tu Feiyang spoke softly, his voice indifferent.

“Indeed, there’s no other way now!” Jin Ziyang spoke softly, his gaze also on Luo Tian.

Fan Jingyu and Mán Hun didn’t speak, but clearly agreed with Tu Feiyang’s words. Their eyes surveyed Luo Tian.

“Go, if you die, I’ll take care of your family!” Tu Feiyang licked his lips and spoke to Luo Tian, his voice carrying a threat.

Luo Tian coldly watched Tu Feiyang’s group but said nothing. He had already planned to act earlier, but Tu Feiyang’s words made him stop his thoughts.

“Tu Feiyang, the matters of Star-Moon Clan don’t concern you! Why don’t you go yourself? He’s only at the early Epoch Realm stage. If he doesn’t come close, he might be killed by that black soul without a chance! This is a pointless sacrifice!” Fu Xianshuan’s eyes glowed with gold, staring at Tu Feiyang.

“I have a Blood-Lusting Pill; if he takes it, his strength will surge to the middle Epoch Realm. However…” Tu Feiyang waved his hand, and a blood-red pill fell into his palm. He addressed Fu Xingyue’s group but didn’t finish his sentence.

Chapter 1490: Effective ()

“Tu Feiyang, you’re making him go to his death?” Seeing Tu Feiyang’s Blood-Lusting Pill, Fu Xingyue’s group changed expressions.

The Blood-Lusting Pill was a unique elixir of the Blood Clan, its effect being to unleash all the blood power of the one who took it, granting an extraordinary combat strength. However, its side effects were terrifying—ultimately causing blood exhaustion and death, like using a forbidden martial art. It was powerful for a moment but short-lived.

“This Blood-Lusting Pill is precious; giving it to him is already a great favor!” Tu Feiyang’s eyes smiled as he addressed Fu Xingyue’s group.

“Fu Xingyue, since we chose to cooperate, we must trust each other. Are you really willing to risk our safety for a servant?” Jin Ziyang and the others looked serious, essentially not considering Luo Tian as a person.

“You…” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xianshuan’s group looked at Tu Feiyang, biting their teeth.

“We…” Fu Xianshuan was about to speak but felt Luo Tian’s voice in their minds, causing them to tremble.

“Fine, since you’ve said this much, there’s nothing more to say! We can choose to let him test it, but you must give him appropriate compensation. If not, we’ll have no choice but to withdraw!” Fu Xingyue spoke coldly, his voice firm.

Seeing Fu Xingyue’s determination, Jin Ziyang and the others’ faces changed. Tu Feiyang had secretly planned this—giving a Blood-Lusting Pill, they also needed to compensate Tu Feiyang. After all, the Blood-Lusting Pill was precious in the Blood Clan.

“Regarding compensation, its value must not be less than the Blood-Lusting Pill!” Fu Xingyang’s face also showed coldness, scanning their faces.

“Fu Xingyue, don’t be greedy! A贱命 (lowly life) is already given; giving him a Blood-Lusting Pill is already generous!” Tu Feiyang spoke softly, trying to intimidate one last time.

“We’re leaving!” Fu Xianshuan looked at Tu Feiyang’s group, sneered and immediately pulled Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang to leave.

Luo Tian feigned gratitude, turned behind them, and smiled.

“Really left?” Seeing the four of them leave without looking back, Tu Feiyang’s group’s faces darkened.

“Boom…” A thunderous sound echoed as Luo Tian and the others turned, a bull-headed soul exploded into gray mist, drifting in the sky. The black soul swallowed it, and its aura gradually rose.

“Wait!” Jin Ziyang’s group immediately changed faces, calling out to the four who had already taken a step toward the Mortal Domain’s exit.

Nine death traps, other places were entered before, but only the Mortal Domain was never entered. Though it was a death trap, there must be extraordinary treasures. They had chosen to go deeper partly to investigate the cause of the Mortal Domain’s eruption, and partly to obtain treasures within it.

At this moment, they could choose to return but were unwilling—unwilling to leave empty-handed. Fu Xingyue had brought the Royal Armaments, which was their reliance.

“Regretted?” Luo Tian also anticipated they would call them back, so the four of them walked slowly.

“Here is a talisman forged by the Feather Clan’s Provisional King. When released, it equals a Provisional King’s full power. Take it!” Fan Jingyu reluctantly gave Fu Xingyue a talisman.

“This Blood-Lusting Pill, take it!” Tu Feiyang returned the previously given Blood-Lusting Pill to Fu Xingyue.

“This is a feather from my clan’s Provisional King. It also equals one strike of a Provisional King!” Jin Ziyang reluctantly gave his treasure.

“By the way, Xuanshuan, you know we’re poor in the Mán Clan. Look at it!” Mán Hun looked embarrassed, addressing Fu Xianshuan since she was the one representing Star-Moon Clan.

“Hmph, it’s okay to owe it, but you must repay it. First teach him the seventh step of Mán Qi Treading!” Fu Xianshuan smiled, addressing Mán Hun.

“This…” Hearing Fu Xianshuan’s words, Mán Hun’s face turned dark. He hadn’t expected her to make such a request.

“Mán Hun, we’ve all given things; you don’t want to take it for free, do you?” Jin Ziyang, Tu Feiyang, and Fan Jingyu looked at Mán Hun with mockery.

“Okay!” Mán Hun saw their mocking eyes, then bit his teeth and nodded. He gave Luo Tian the seventh step of Mán Qi Treading’s incantation into his mind. After all, he thought Luo Tian would definitely die against the black soul, just to test it for them.

Luo Tian’s lips slightly curled; he knew Mán Qi Treading, but it was just an excuse to use it.

“Alright, Fu Xingyue, you’ve received the items. Is it time to do your job?” Tu Feiyang and the others smiled, addressing Fu Xingyue.

“Hmph,” Fu Xingyue handed the three items to Luo Tian, addressing him: “Brother, I’ll take care of your family.”

“Cough cough…” Fu Xingyang and Fu Xianshuan’s lips twitched, watching Fu Xingyue’s reluctant gaze. They sighed inwardly; Fu Xingyue was really good at acting.

“For the Emperor, for Star-Moon Clan, I, Gu Sansi, would die without regret!” Luo Tian naturally cooperated, his eyes showing determination. He took the Blood-Lusting Pill.

“Emperor, I know I’ll die for this, so I don’t need these things. I’ll leave them to Star-Moon Clan!” Luo Tian gave the golden feather and talisman to Fu Xianshuan, his eyes filled with solemnity.

“Truly a good subordinate!” Tu Feiyang and Jin Ziyang looked at Luo Tian’s solemn expression, their eyes showing admiration.

“Indeed, brother, for your loyalty, I’ll break my rule today and teach you all of Mán Qi Treading. Hope you return safely!” Mán Hun smiled, transmitting to Luo Tian.

“Thank you, Elder Mán!” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly, winking at Fu Xianshuan before turning to Mán Hun.

“Enough time wasted; go!” Tu Feiyang didn’t want to waste more time, as during their conversation, the black soul had swallowed another bull-headed soul. Its aura was nearly complete, and the other two bull-headed souls were also wounded, constantly being devoured by the black soul.

“I’m going!” Luo Tian soared into the air, his body flashing as he became a streak of light toward the black soul. He seemed determined to die.

Seeing Luo Tian approaching, the black soul didn’t take him seriously, spitting out a stream of dark mist toward Luo Tian. Then it turned to devour the remaining two bull-headed souls.

“Boom…” But Luo Tian wasn’t that easy to deal with; his invincible body broke through the dark mist, instantly reaching the black soul. He punched it.

The black soul was stunned; it hadn’t expected Luo Tian to break through its attack. In that moment, Luo Tian’s fist pierced the void and struck the black soul’s massive body.

“Hit it?” Tu Feiyang and the others watched Luo Tian punch into the black soul’s body, their eyes filled with hope.

They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to withstand the black soul’s attack, but soon they were disappointed.

The black soul hadn’t suffered any real damage; instead, it formed a massive black hand with terrifying power and slammed down on Luo Tian.

“Done…” Tu Feiyang’s group sighed, looking at Fu Xingyue.

Fu Xianshuan also looked tense; although Luo Tian had told them he was confident, the opponent was nearly a Provisional King.

“Prepare to use the Royal Armaments!” Jin Ziyang spoke softly; they had no other options.

“Roar…” As they were disappointed, a piercing scream echoed in their ears. The sound made their hearts tremble.

“Boom…” That terrifying hand hadn’t fully formed yet, but it exploded into a massive gust of wind, sweeping around and blowing against Fu Xingyue’s group.
