“Pang…” Luo Tian’s figure fell to the ground in a clumsy manner, yet his face bore an expression of great joy. His reverent gaze turned toward the trembling old man, who looked at him with bewilderment, as though unable to comprehend his words. Luo Tian let out a quiet laugh in his mind but kept his expression neutral, fearing the old man might expel him from the inn.

Upon emerging, Ding Yuanshan and Ding Xiaoyan exchanged glances, their faces flickering with surprise. They had not expected Luo Tian to have brought them into the inn.

But when Ding Yuanshan spotted the old man, his face paled. “Old Changtou, how did you end up here? Did you not escape from Lishui City?”

“Old Changtou!” Luo Tian’s lips twitched as Ding Yuanshan addressed the old man, a strange feeling stirring within him.

“I’m old and feeble. Before I could flee, this young man rushed in shouting he wanted to stay in the hall. I was so frightened I collapsed,” the old man stammered, sweat pouring down his face.

“Luo… Luo Tian. Did you mistake Old Changtou for that elder?” Ding Yuanshan turned, his face twisted with confusion.

“Ah…” Luo Tian finally understood. He had mistaken the old man for a cultivator—this was merely an ordinary human.

Luo Tian nearly cursed aloud but restrained himself, fearing the elder might still be nearby. His face flushed crimson as he caught Ding Xiaoyan’s smirk.

“Where is that elder?” After a moment, Luo Tian steadied himself and asked in a grave tone.

“He’s already left. Oh, that elder was the innkeeper. Only I and a few city lords knew his identity. We discovered his existence by chance.”

As Ding Yuanshan prepared to elaborate on how he met the elder, Luo Tian cut him off. “Ding Elder, we should focus on escaping now. There’s a late-stage Yuanling powerhouse outside. I can’t fight him. Even though Lin Changqing is wounded, Yuanling cultivators recover at terrifying speed. If they join forces, we’re doomed!”

Ding Yuanshan showed no anger at the interruption but instead gaped in shock upon hearing Lin Changqing had been wounded.

When he learned of the late-stage Yuanling elder outside, his face darkened. “If I’m not mistaken, this is Dong Zhiyuan, one of the five city guards of Beichang. I never thought he’d defy the Five Clans’ rules and venture beyond a hundred miles from Beichang!”

“Can city guards not leave Beichang?” Luo Tian asked, puzzled.

“Of course they can’t. If the five city guards abandon Beichang, who will guard it? The saying ‘only enter, never exit’ would be meaningless. Thus, the Five Clans decreed that city guards must not leave Beichang’s hundred-mile radius.”

After hearing this, Luo Tian nodded in understanding. “But our immediate concern is escaping from this old dog. This formation feels weaker now—can it withstand his next attack?”

“Since he defied the rules, we’ll defy them too. I’ll send a message to my uncle to rescue us,” Ding Yuanshan said, his face hardening. He lit a stick of incense and sent it soaring through the formation toward the horizon.

At that moment, Lin Changqing and Dong Zimou arrived at the inn’s entrance. They recounted to Dong Zhiyuan how a cultivator had once dwelled in the inn, deepening his grim expression.

Six chapters… Six chapters… The promised six chapters!

Chapter 436: Ding Hongfei

Chapter 436: Ding Hongfei

Seeing the blue smoke escape the formation, Luo Tian felt a flicker of surprise. He had personally tested this barrier—yet it allowed the smoke to pass.

Then his face darkened. “No good!”

“What’s wrong?” Zheng Xin and the others asked, puzzled.

“Originally, there was a cultivator here who terrified this old dog. With Dong Zimou’s words, he’d be even more cautious. But now that this smoke has escaped, it means we’ve sought help from Elder Ding Hongfei. Dong Zhiyuan will surely realize that!”

Luo Tian’s face grew solemn as he spoke. The others mirrored his concern, their minds sharp enough to grasp the implication instantly.

“What if I go out and reveal my identity? He won’t dare harm me!” Zheng Xin frowned.

“Even if you did, Dong’s people are now mad. Not even both of you together would fare well. Wait—where is Qiu Chan?” Luo Tian’s face tensed.

He suddenly remembered: Cold Qiu Chan had not joined them. A sigh escaped his lips. “Qiu Chan, don’t come here!”

A shadow fell over them all. A late-stage Yuanling and an injured early-stage Yuanling—no match for their group.

“Sitting idle isn’t my style. If they want to kill me, they’ll have to be ready to lose a piece of themselves!” Luo Tian’s face hardened.

Outside the inn, Dong Zhiyuan still hesitated, gazing at the unassuming building. Dong Zimou and Lin Changqing stood before him, their faces grim.

But then Dong Zhiyuan’s eyes lit up. A wisp of blue smoke drifted upward, heading toward Beichang.

“Hmph… Lin Elder, rest. We’ll break this formation together,” Dong Zhiyuan said with a smile.

“What about that elder?” Lin Changqing and Dong Zimou asked, confusion in their eyes.

“Haha… elder? If he were here, would we be standing safely now? And didn’t you notice that blue smoke? If I’m not mistaken, it’s Ding Family’s youth seeking help from Elder Ding Hongfei. That speaks volumes, doesn’t it?” Dong Zhiyuan said softly.

Upon hearing this, Lin Changqing and Dong Zimou nodded in understanding. Their lips curled into grim smiles as they gazed at the blue-aura inn.

Inside, Luo Tian’s face was solemn. He sat on the ground, his energy coalescing as he activated both the Five Elements Cultivation Technique and the Azure Wood Emperor Scripture, absorbing the surrounding yuan energy.

Zheng Xin and the others were sealed within his Nailing Spirit Bag. After all, this battle was beyond their capacity. Only Long Baobao remained outside—Luo Tian needed the yuan vein within his body.

As both Luo Tian and Lin Changqing recovered, Ding Hongfei of Beichang stood atop the city wall. He spotted a wisp of blue smoke drifting toward him and sighed softly. “Lishui City is in trouble? If it weren’t dire, Yuanshan wouldn’t have sought me.”

After murmuring, Ding Hongfei gazed deeply at Beichang before spreading his spiritual energy wings and vanishing from the city wall.

A day passed. The terrifying recovery speed of Yuanling cultivators, combined with pills, had restored Lin Changqing’s injuries to eight-tenths. He opened his eyes, his gaze venomous toward the inn as if he could see Luo Tian through the barrier.

“Alright. Let’s break this formation together!” Dong Zhiyuan, who had been silent, opened his eyes. His piercing gaze fell on the pale-blue barrier.

After a day’s toll, this formation no longer intimidated him. To him, breaking it was merely a matter of time.

Lin Changqing nodded and drew his sword. His face twisted with grim determination as he channeled yuan energy into the green blade.

Dong Zhiyuan also swung his sword, summoning five dragon-slaying energy blades that coalesced on his golden blade.

Eyes wide, Dong Zimou felt the moment the barrier would be shattered. Luo Tian and his group would surely be slain by the elder’s thunder strike, leaving no chance for escape.

But just as their energy blades formed, dark clouds gathered overhead, blotting out the sun. A heavy atmosphere formed in the sky.

Dong Zimou marveled at the power of Yuanling cultivators, who could even affect the weather.

Dong Zhiyuan and Lin Changqing frowned. Though confident in their strength, they hadn’t reached the level to control weather. The clouds stirred a strange familiarity but passed quickly as they focused on the pale-blue barrier.

“Hmph!” They both sneered, their energy blades surging toward the barrier.

The explosion echoed. The weakening barrier shattered under their combined might, and the inn collapsed in the aftermath, revealing Luo Tian and Long Baobao.

“Boom…!” Thunder rumbled across the sky as black clouds pressed lower.

Luo Tian’s gaze was solemn. His palm pressed against Long Baobao’s back, sweat beading on his forehead as he channeled immense power.

“I see. He’s trying to break into Yuanling!” Dong Zhiyuan and Lin Changqing’s faces paled, then twisted with mockery.

“Kid, your plan is good, but Yuanling isn’t so easily entered. If you just rush in, we old-timers would be eating dirt!” Lin Changqing sneered.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian’s yuan energy surged violently. His eyes snapped open, locking onto Lin Changqing.

That gaze struck like lightning, knocking Lin Changqing back several steps.

“Kid, who are you trying to scare?” Dong Zhiyuan’s face also twisted with mockery. He summoned another dragon-slaying energy blade.

“I’ll show you!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cold determination. He gazed at the darkening clouds above.

Chapter 437: Thunder Tribulation

As Luo Tian’s gaze met the sky, Dong Zhiyuan and Lin Changqing’s eyes narrowed. They turned to the sky, then paled.

“Thunder Tribulation! I never thought this kid would summon it!” Dong Zhiyuan’s face darkened, his eyes on the swirling thunderclouds.

“Kid! Before you face your tribulation, I’ll give you one!” Dong Zhiyuan sneered, his dragon-slaying energy blade slicing toward Luo Tian.

“I’ll join too!碧麟青剑!” Lin Changqing sneered, his emerald sword flashing as it slashed toward Luo Tian.

After striking, they didn’t hesitate. They retreated tens of thousands of feet, their spiritual senses probing the spot where Luo Tian stood.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly. He waved his hand, summoning the Zhenhun Ding to block.

The deafening sound echoed. The massive Zhenhun Ding blocked the two energy blades, emitting a thunderous roar.

“This cauldron is truly a treasure!” Dong Zhiyuan’s face darkened with greed, his eyes on the Zhenhun Ding. But he didn’t advance to seize it.

They knew that if they entered Luo Tian’s thousand-foot radius, the thunder tribulation would intensify several times over and even target them.

Though the Zhenhun Ding was a rare treasure, Luo Tian’s current cultivation—late-stage Hua Gu—prevented it from reaching its full potential.

Though the two energy blades were blocked, their immense force pushed the Zhenhun Ding backward.

Luo Tian saw danger and quickly sealed Long Baobao in his Nailing Spirit Bag to protect him.

At the moment he sealed Long Baobao, the Zhenhun Ding’s massive body had already reached his front.

“Stop!” Luo Tian raised his hands, his spiritual senses surging to halt the Zhenhun Ding.

But he had underestimated Dong Zhiyuan and Lin Changqing’s attack. The Zhenhun Ding, like a massive hammer, smashed into Luo Tian’s body.

Luo Tian felt a force surging through his arms and throughout his body, shaking his mind. He spat blood onto the Zhenhun Ding.

The massive cauldron, carrying Luo Tian’s body, smashed through several walls before stopping.

Luo Tian’s face showed weakness. He grabbed a five-star pill, Hui Chun Dan (Regeneration Pill), and swallowed it without hesitation. He knew now wasn’t the time to conserve pills.

As he swallowed, a thick lightning bolt descended from the sky, glowing white. It streaked toward Luo Tian’s pale face.

Luo Tian trembled but raised his fist, channeling all his wood-element energy into a swirling gray mist that weakened the lightning’s power by five parts. The remaining five parts struck Luo Tian, leaving him numb but unharmed.

“Haha… expected. The first thunder tribulation drained all my wood-element yuan energy. Next won’t be hard!” Luo Tian’s face showed confidence.

“Did he block it?” Dong Zimou’s face was stunned. He had never seen such a powerful thunder tribulation blocked.

“Normal. A late-stage Hua Gu with some preparation could block it. This kid’s success is natural,” Dong Zhiyuan said, his face calm as he watched the thunderclouds swirl again.

“How many tribulations will this kid face? I estimate his abnormal physique would at least face five!” Lin Changqing mused, admiration in his voice. He had only faced three tribulations when he cultivated, and now this late-stage Hua Gu made him feel inferior. Calling it five was a conservative estimate.

“Second tribulation is coming!” Lin Changqing’s face showed eagerness. Witnessing a genius’s demise was rare.

“Too bad for this abnormal physique. If he enters Yuanling, I’d have no chance against him!” Dong Zhiyuan said.

As they spoke, a thick lightning arc descended from the sky. Though it seemed slow, it reached Luo Tian in an instant.

“Huangji Seal!” Luo Tian’s hands trembled. He had prepared this technique all along, merging it into a terrifying aura that he hurled toward the lightning arc.

The Huangji Seal, Luo Tian’s strongest technique, had remained unused since he gained seven elements. Now it was unleashed with the authority of an emperor.

“Boom…!” The deep sound echoed again, traveling far. Even Dong Zhiyuan’s face darkened—he knew the tribulation’s destructive power. Yet Luo Tian had blocked it with this technique.

“Huangji Seal truly rivals heavenly might!” Luo Tian muttered, gazing at the sky. His yuan energy was now less than a third, and his spiritual senses were weakened. Combined with the Zhenhun Ding’s earlier attack, he was at least one level below his prime—equivalent to a single-element late-stage Hua Gu.

The only comfort was that the Huangji Seal had blocked the tribulation, giving him time to breathe. Pills were consumed like water as he stuffed them into his mouth.

“Come on! Come on! You old heaven, you can’t take my life. If I become Yuanling, the world will change. The future peak strength of Tianyuan Continent must include my name, Luo Tian!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with wild arrogance. His long hair blew as he faced the forming, water-tube-thick thunder tribulation.

Chapter 438: Purple Yuan Demon Thunder

Dong Zhiyuan and Lin Changqing’s faces were stunned as they watched the thunder tribulation form.

The tribulation seemed to understand Luo Tian’s words, enraged. A terrifying pressure radiated from the thunderclouds as lightning transformed into a green dragon, roaring at Luo Tian like an ant.

“This tribulation’s power rivals four!” Lin Changqing’s face was stunned. He recalled his own three tribulations, which paled in comparison to this pressure.

“Indeed, it rivals four!” Dong Zhiyuan’s face was solemn. He had faced four tribulations and entered Yuanling. Remembering his own desperation, he wore a look of lingering fear.

“Roar…” The thunder sea churned. The lightning dragon roared, circling toward Luo Tian, who stood defiant.

“Stop!” Luo Tian barked. From his storage ring, a burst of light erupted—numerous sharp and heavy weapons flew out like a meteor shower.

“Those are…!”

“They’re all Xuan-grade treasures!” Dong Zhiyuan and Lin Changqing’s faces were stunned, gazing at the weapons flying from Luo Tian’s hands. Their expressions were filled with disbelief.

Indeed, these were treasures Luo Tian had gathered over the years—now all unleashed toward the dragon.

“Rich!”

“I’ve lived this long and never seen a kid so rich!” Lin Changqing sighed, watching the Xuan-grade treasures approach the tribulation.

“But what’s the use? Though they’re Xuan-grade, they can’t withstand a moment under this three-tribulation!” Lin Changqing’s face showed confusion.

“If I’m not mistaken, he’s going to…” Dong Zhiyuan’s face was stunned, suspecting a possibility.

As his words ended, the first few Xuan-grade treasures were instantly devoured by the lightning, leaving no ash.

Seeing their disappearance, Luo Tian showed no regret. He barked: “Explosive…!”

His words ended, and the Xuan-grade treasures emitted a buzzing sound. One… two… five…

Hundreds of high-tier Xuan-grade treasures erupted in Luo Tian’s control, creating a deafening sound. A wave of overwhelming power formed above him.

The explosion was colossal. Under Luo Tian’s gaze, hundreds of Xuan-grade treasures exploded, colliding with the dragon.

Two apocalyptic forces collided. An invisible wave spread from the explosion, nearly toppling Luo Tian. The ground trembled thrice.

Entire Lishui City’s buildings collapsed, even those on the city’s outskirts were affected.

Countless people stood outside Lishui City, their faces filled with terror as they watched the mushroom cloud formed by the explosion. Their expressions were fearful.

Some commoners fell to their knees, bowing repeatedly toward the sky, believing heaven was angry.

Among them stood a black-clad woman with a veil. Her face showed concern as she gazed at the thunderclouds, sensing an unusual connection to Luo Tian.

This woman was Cold Qiu Chan. She had been resting in the inn when a clash of Yuanling-level power erupted from the city hall. She had hidden among the crowd, knowing her presence would only hinder Luo Tian. Unless she used forbidden powers.

Before Qiu Chan could enter the city hall, Luo Tian had activated his fifth step of the Sealing Steps and vanished in two breaths.

Qiu Chan tried to follow but didn’t know where Luo Tian was. She joined the chaotic crowd leaving Lishui City.

“Must be Luo Tian!” Qiu Chan’s face was resolute. She couldn’t think of anyone else who could withstand such an abnormal tribulation.

She vanished in a black whirlwind, rushing toward the direction of Luo Tian’s thunder tribulation.

“Not sure how many tribulations I’ll face,” Luo Tian sighed, hoping for more but also dreading it. The next tribulations would be his to endure.

“Fourth!” Luo Tian’s face was solemn as he gazed at the dragon now forming in the sky.

But this time, it wasn’t a green dragon. It had turned into a pale purple lightning snake, thinner than the previous water-tube-thick tribulation.

“This!”

“Purple Yuan Demon Thunder! He’s already summoned it at the fourth tribulation!” Lin Changqing and Dong Zhiyuan were stunned, gazing at the thirty-foot-long purple thunder.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed. He felt this purple tribulation wasn’t strong, but a deep sense of danger stirred within him.

“This tribulation can’t be resisted directly!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly.

“But now I have no choice. The tribulation shows no sign of stopping. If I can’t withstand this one, how will I face the rest?” Luo Tian’s eyes hardened.

“Buzz…” A powerful yuan energy surge rose from Luo Tian. The five-star pill he had taken restored his yuan to three-tenths.

“Sss…” The purple lightning snake, like a predator spotting its prey, shot toward Luo Tian. A brilliant violet light illuminated the sky.

Luo Tian’s battle spirit surged. He launched his Mie Sheng Fist and grabbed the Golden Spear, its golden blade radiating a tearing aura as it pierced the violet lightning.

“This kid is too abnormal. Even at the fourth tribulation, he’s summoned what people usually face at the sixth!” Dong Zhiyuan’s face was stunned, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Sixth!” Upon hearing Dong Zhiyuan’s words, Lin Changqing’s face was also shocked. As a senior of the Tianjian Sect, he had heard that their sect’s ancestor entered Yuanling after facing seven tribulations.

This Luo Tian faced the sixth tribulation at the fourth—was his talent higher than their sect’s ancestor?

As they marveled, the purple lightning collided with Luo Tian’s fist and the second form of the Golden Spear, “Jin Shi Wei Kai.”

Chapter 439: Five Elements Thunder Tribulation

The purple lightning snake collided with Luo Tian’s techniques, but what terrified him was that his two powerful techniques were fragile against the purple yuan lightning. They shattered instantly.

“He can’t withstand it!” Lin Changqing’s breath quickened, envisioning Luo Tian being obliterated by the purple lightning.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian sneered, no longer retreating. He surged upward like a golden phoenix.

“Is he mad?” Dong Zhiyuan and Lin Changqing’s faces trembled, gazing at Luo Tian as if he were heading to his death.

But at that moment, Luo Tian collided with the purple lightning.

The violet lightning instantly enveloped Luo Tian’s body, as if he wore a purple robe. Yet he felt excruciating pain, every inch of his body hurting.

“Roar…” Luo Tian roared in agony.

He had endured much pain before, but none compared to this Purple Yuan Demon Thunder.

Luo Tian’s body turned black under Dong Zhiyuan and Lin Changqing’s watch, smoke rising from his skin.

Luo Tian had reached the center of the Purple Yuan Demon Thunder but felt every inch of his skin penetrated by the lightning.

“One breath… two breaths…” After several breaths, Luo Tian’s body turned completely black, his face obscured.

“Pang…” The blackened body fell to the ground with a dull thud.

“Dead?” Dong Zhiyuan’s face showed relief. Even he would be cautious under such a powerful tribulation, risking his life.

Lin Changqing exhaled deeply. He no longer wanted to avenge his disciple. Luo Tian was too terrifying; if he entered Yuanling, he’d have no chance of resistance.

“Not dead! He won’t die!” Cold Qiu Chan, running toward the scene, showed fierce confidence. She had felt the destructive power of the purple lightning but inexplicably trusted Luo Tian.

“Pang…” Luo Tian’s body fell to the ground like a charcoal block, emitting smoke.

“Not right! He’s not dead. The thunderclouds haven’t dispersed!” Dong Zhiyuan was stunned, gazing at the swirling thunderclouds and then at Luo Tian’s charcoal-like body.

As Dong Zhiyuan and Lin Changqing turned their gaze to Luo Tian, green energy sprouted from his body. His blackened skin rapidly regenerated under the green light.

After ten breaths, Luo Tian’s body seemed to shed its skin. His blackened flesh peeled off in pieces.

Suddenly, Luo Tian opened his eyes, a glimmer of joy on his face as he gazed at the thunder tribulation like it was treasure.

“The essence of wood-element cultivation, I had forgotten!” Dong Zhiyuan and Lin Changqing suddenly recalled why Luo Tian had survived.

“Too abnormal. Surviving such a tribulation!” Lin Changqing trembled, watching Luo Tian rise again.

“Haha…” Luo Tian laughed aloud. He felt incredibly powerful now. Though the tribulation had nearly killed him, it had tempered his body into something stronger. Even his internal organs were more resilient.

“Indeed, crisis and opportunity coexist. Come on!” Luo Tian roared as a deep pressure returned to the sky.

“Another one? Fifth tribulation. I wonder what it’ll be like—will it rival the seventh of ordinary people?” Lin Changqing’s eyes trembled, gazing at Luo Tian, now more energetic.

Hearing Lin Changqing’s words, Dong Zhiyuan wore a look of anticipation. He too wanted to see what Luo Tian’s fifth tribulation would be.

“Boom…!” The deep sound echoed. The thunderclouds above seemed like a sea of lightning, constantly churning.

The pressure instantly fell on Luo Tian. It was the will of heaven itself, making resistance impossible.

“Is it coming?” Luo Tian’s face tensed.

“Crack…” A golden lightning bolt split the sky, instantly reaching Luo Tian’s head.

Luo Tian still punched forward, slightly reducing the tribulation’s power. He rushed into the thunder with no regard for his life.

The explosion echoed. After surviving the Purple Yuan Demon Thunder, Luo Tian wasn’t as worried about his life. He clearly felt this golden lightning tribulation was terrifying but not as powerful as the purple one.

In a moment, he blocked it. Though still battered and blackened, his eyes were bright.

“Boom…!” Before Luo Tian could catch his breath, a green lightning bolt struck him, making him even more battered.

But before he could block the green lightning, thunder roared again. A blue lightning snake, like a river, struck Luo Tian.

Red… brown… several tribulations surged toward him. Including the golden lightning he had already blocked, five tribulations formed five dragons, creating a thunder net. One after another, they struck Luo Tian.

“Pang…” At the second tribulation’s arrival, he was knocked to the ground again, turning into a blackened charcoal. The thunder struck him relentlessly without pause.

“Five Elements Yuan Thunder! I never thought I’d witness the legendary Five Elements Yuan Thunder!” Lin Changqing’s eyes were filled with fear, gazing at the five-colored tribulations.

“Five Elements Yuan Thunder?” Dong Zhiyuan’s face was puzzled. Though he was a late-stage Yuanling, his knowledge clearly lagged behind Lin Changqing’s position as a Tianjian Sect elder.

“Yuanling tribulations max out at nine. Legends say some rebellious people faced the fourth tribulation, then five thunderbolts appeared together, forming Five Elements Yuan Thunder to annihilate them. No mercy!” Lin Changqing explained.

Upon hearing this, Dong Zhiyuan’s face was stunned. His gaze was sympathetic toward Luo Tian, who was repeatedly struck by thunder.

“Should we leave?” Lin Changqing swayed his head slightly, a sigh on his face.

Chapter 440: Rebirth from Death

Seeing Lin Changqing’s desire to leave, Dong Zhiyuan shook his head. He had heard of the Five Elements Yuan Thunder—Luo Tian had no chance of survival.

Yet Dong Zhiyuan didn’t want to leave. The Five Elements Yuan Thunder was rare, and he still coveted the treasures on Luo Tian’s body, hoping to retain some after this tribulation.

Cold Qiu Chan arrived at Lishui City. She saw Luo Tian repeatedly struck by heavenly thunder, tears streaming down her face. Her feet moved slightly as she prepared to rush toward Luo Tian despite the danger, but she stopped herself.

She knew if she entered, it would trigger more thunder. Luo Tian had already summoned Five Elements Yuan Thunder; adding her presence might summon even more terrifying lightning, leaving no chance for Luo Tian to survive.

Thinking this, she stopped. Her gaze trembled as she watched Luo Tian.

“That woman must be the daughter of the Yuling Sect,” Lin Changqing observed, his eyes calculating. He knew if Luo Tian died in the heavenly tribulation, it wouldn’t be him who killed him. If he had, he’d have no escape.

But now Luo Tian was killed by the heavenly tribulation. If handled properly, no one would link his death to him. However, Cold Qiu Chan held a significant position in Yuling Sect; killing her would bring endless trouble.

After thinking, Lin Changqing’s eyes flashed with coldness. He gazed at Cold Qiu Chan and then hid, weighing the pros and cons. Finally, he decided to wait until Luo Tian died before making a decision.
