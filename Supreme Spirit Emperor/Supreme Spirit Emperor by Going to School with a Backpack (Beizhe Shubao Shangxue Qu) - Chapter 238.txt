“However, the Epoch Master can only produce one per epoch. How could it appear in the same epoch!” Luo Tian's mind was also deeply puzzled.

“That is a divine medicine!” Li Cheng'en’s face then showed a hint of great joy, gazing at a wobbly green divine medicine swaying beside the cliff wall. It radiated waves of vitality, drawing the attention of the three.

“The Medicine Sage should be atop the mountain!” Li Cheng'en’s eyes showed a flicker of hesitation, pondering whether to continue ascending the cliff.

After careful consideration, Li Cheng'en decided not to proceed further. After all, the blood of the Reincarnation Body was terrifying beyond comprehension; even such a powerful being had perished here. Compared to the Reincarnation Body at the peak of an epoch, they were no more than ants. A single spittle from it could pin them down.

“A rare divine medicine, not a loss!” Li Cheng'en’s face showed a smile as he gazed at the pressure on his bloodline, slowly approaching the divine medicine.

“Crack…” Even Li Cheng'en felt his physical body could no longer endure. The peak of an epoch, even after death, its aura remained formidable. Li Cheng'en’s body began to crack, and green blood continuously spilled from his form.

“Opportunity!” Luo Tian stood at a distance. He could sense Li Cheng'en’s strength was severely suppressed, his eyes flashing with sharp light. He reached out and took the Shangtian Bow.

“Old dog, today I’ll make you lose your chicken and miss the rice!” Luo Tian’s mind sneered. He instantly activated his demonic path, like a demon king, revealing an icy smile and drawing his bow to aim at Li Cheng'en.

“Burst…” A low sound echoed from Luo Tian’s hand, a black arrow lightning bolt instantly appearing at Li Cheng'en's back.

At that moment, Li Cheng'en bore the pressure of his bloodline. Blood continuously spilled from his body, but due to being at Broken Soul Cliff, he had remained tense. At the moment Luo Tian shot, Li Cheng'en sensed a wave of danger and instantly shifted his body sideways.

“Pf…” The black demonic arrow pierced Li Cheng'en’s body, which had begun to crack. It gave him a chill.

“Who…” Li Cheng'en’s face showed shock, his gaze scanning the cliff's summit. His eyes carried a hint of fear, dreading that someone terrifying might descend from the cliff.

“I!” The demonic aura surged. Luo Tian stepped on the幽冥鬼步 (Yanming Ghost Step), instantly appearing before Li Cheng'en. He was unaffected by the Reincarnation Blood, bypassing Li Cheng'en to stand before the rare divine medicine.

“Haha, old turtle, are you angry?” Luo Tian stood before the divine medicine, watching Li Cheng'en’s face break out in cold sweat.

“Who are you?” Li Cheng’en's face darkened, gazing at Luo Tian. He sensed Luo Tian was only at the early stage of a saint, his anger intensifying.

“His name is Luo Tian!” Two late-stage saints showed shock on their faces, eyes filled with disbelief.

“Luo Tian!” Li Cheng'en had felt Luo Tian was familiar. He suddenly recalled the image of Luo Tian in his memory, overlapping with this young man.

“How come you are not suppressed by the bloodline?” Li Cheng'en’s face showed a hint of shock, gazing at Luo Tian, seeing him lively and energetic.

“Seems your understanding of me is still insufficient. Have you forgotten what kind of body I have? I am of the same origin as this one! Do you think I would be suppressed?” Luo Tian’s face bore mockery. He grabbed the rare divine medicine in his hand.

“Dare you!” Li Cheng'en saw his painstakingly acquired divine medicine falling into Luo Tian’s hands. His face turned red with anger, shouting at Luo Tian.

“Haha, old fool, what else are you not daring to do? If I were timid, the saint at peak of Lei Domain wouldn’t have died!” Luo Tian grabbed the divine medicine and pulled it out, storing it. He looked at Li Cheng'en with a playful expression.

“I’ll kill you!” Li Cheng'en’s eyes turned bloodshot. His lifespan was nearly over, and this rare divine medicine was his means of prolonging life. Now it had been taken by Luo Tian, equivalent to taking his life.

“I don’t just want this divine medicine. I’ll take the lives of all three of you!” Luo Tian’s face showed a hint of smile. Black demonic arrows凝聚 (congregated) and he directly formed two, aiming at the two late-stage saints.

“This… Grandfather save me…” Two late-stage saints showed fear, gazing at Luo Tian. They could sense that this arrow would not kill them but would severely wound them.

Especially at the cliff wall of Reincarnation Blood, their strength was suppressed. Luo Tian, however, thrived.

“Damn it!” Li Cheng'en’s face darkened. He turned around to rescue but the heavy pressure made him too late.

“Haha, old dog, bury these two for you!” Luo Tian laughed as two black demonic arrows shot out.

“Pf… Pf…” No exception, the two late-stage saints of Lei Domain turned into two clouds of blood mist, floating in the grey Soul-Eating Mist.

“Roar…” But before they could regenerate blood, the cliff wall stained with Reincarnation Blood emitted a series of roars. A powerful suction formed an invisible vortex, absorbing the two late-stage saints’ blood into the cliff wall.

“This…” Li Cheng'en was completely terrified, gazing at the sinister cliff wall with a look of shock.

Luo Tian also felt a chill. He gazed at the cliff wall, recalling something: A saint at early stage could regenerate blood. But this cliff wall had the blood of a Reincarnation Body at the peak of an epoch. Why hadn’t this blood regenerated? Instead, it remained on the cliff wall.

“Too sinister. Can't shoot another arrow. I'll give this old man one more, then leave. Staying too long is dangerous!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed decisiveness. His black demonic arrow shot without hesitation toward Li Cheng'en.

This arrow used Luo Tian’s saintly power. He had already shot three arrows, completely exhausting the medicinal energy within his body.

Luo Tian didn’t even look at the result. The thought of collecting some Reincarnation Blood was also discarded. He instantly transformed into a black light, leaping upward toward the base of Broken Soul Cliff.

“Pf…” Li Cheng'en had retreated a distance. The blood pressure was no longer so intense, but he still received the arrow in his arm.

“Little scum! You’ll die!” After two arrows and the previous consumption of picking up the divine medicine, the old man’s body was severely wounded. Even his approaching lifespan had been advanced by fifty years.

“Disturbers of the master shall die!” As Li Cheng'en exited the pressure range and tried to chase Luo Tian, a cold voice echoed across Broken Soul Cliff.

Chapter 1033: The White-Cloaked Woman

In the Four Sacred Star Domains, at Broken Soul Cliff, after Luo Tian shot his final arrow, he transformed into a black light and flew downward.

“Little scum! You’ll die!” Li Cheng'en watched his arm slowly regenerate, face filled with anger. He had come to Broken Soul Cliff and suffered heavy losses, yet gained nothing. This made him even more resentful of Luo Tian.

After all, Li Cheng'en was a saint at the peak. He quickly exited the pressure range of Reincarnation Blood, his face showing a grim expression.

But at this moment, Luo Tian had already reached the base of Broken Soul Cliff. He looked back at Li Cheng'en with a smile: “Old dog, I’ll go first. I’ll wait for you on the Tianyuan Continent!”

“Disturbers of the master shall die!” Luo Tian’s words had barely finished when a cold voice echoed across Broken Soul Cliff. A furious aura instantly surged from the cliff’s top, pouring toward Li Cheng'en.

“This…” Li Cheng'en's eyes, which had been filled with murderous intent, suddenly widened. His face showed tension as he felt a terrifying fluctuation locking onto him.

Luo Tian’s purple eyes also widened, his gaze filled with disbelief. It was as if he had seen something terrifying, his body trembling slightly.

Luo Tian didn’t know why. At this moment, his vision was unaffected by the Soul-Eating Mist, allowing him to see the entire Broken Soul Cliff.

At the cliff’s summit stood a dilapidated temple. Every building seemed to have endured countless ages, ancient and broken, yet it radiated an aura that made Luo Tian’s heart tremble. He felt no desire to resist.

What shocked Luo Tian most was a gray beast soaring above the temple, its massive body and fierce fangs terrifying.

“That must be the Soul-Eating Beast!” Luo Tian mused, gazing at the massive beast. On its back sat a woman in white robes, holding a flower with nine-colored petals.

The petals were divided into nine pieces, each of different colors. Luo Tian’s face showed shock as he exclaimed: “Medicine Sage! Nine-Extinction Mortal Flower!”

The Nine-Extinction Mortal Flower was an immortal medicinal herb. Every million years, it grew one petal. After nine million years, it would be complete.

Like beasts of power, medicinal herbs focused on their lineage. Some herbs, even with long lifespans, could never become a Medicine Sage. Since ancient times, there had been only a few Medicine Sages, most of which were possessed by Epoch Masters. Few were unclaimed.

Luo Tian wanted to see the woman’s face but no matter how he tried, he could only discern her graceful figure. He couldn’t see her face.

“Holding a Medicine Sage! Could this woman be an Epoch Master!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed fear. If she were a living Epoch Master, it would be too terrifying.

“Alas…” A long sigh echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. Two eyes like full moons gazed at him, causing his mind to tremble.

“Destroy!” Luo Tian was certain that one glance from her would annihilate him. His heart filled with fear.

But after careful observation, Luo Tian relaxed. He could sense that this woman was not her true self.

“Not a true body, but it still gave me such great pressure!” Luo Tian’s heart trembled. He secretly marveled at how terrifying she would be if it were her true self.

Next to the woman stood a youth with confused eyes. His body radiated waves of divine light, but his vacant gaze suggested he had lost his mind.

“Another same origin!” Luo Tian was shocked, his face filled with disbelief. The youth next to the woman was also a Reincarnation Body!

“Is this Reincarnation Body the same as the one on the cliff wall?” Luo Tian was completely confused, his shock immeasurable.

The woman only glanced at him before vanishing with the Soul-Eating Beast and the Reincarnation Body’s flesh. A gray-furred humanoid creature emerged from the ancient temple, its massive killing intent locking onto Li Cheng'en. It instantly reached him, its sharp claws aiming at his chest.

One strike and the void trembled. The seemingly black fingers directly severed the void, appearing before Li Cheng'en.

Li Cheng'en was also chilled. He had never seen such a thing—neither human nor non-human, yet humanoid.

Regardless of its nature, the terrifying strength was undeniable. The sharp claws tore a piece of Li Cheng'en’s flesh.

“Haha…” A cold laugh echoed in Li Cheng'en’s ears, causing him to break out in sweat.

In an instant, the humanoid beast's attack descended again. Its thick fist smashed toward Li Cheng'en’s chest.

“This is the flesh of an Epoch-level powerhouse, refined over time to gain its own consciousness!” Luo Tian’s purple eyes saw the gray-furred monster, its body hollow. He couldn’t help but shiver.

“What in hell is this place? What terrifying presence lies within that temple!” Luo Tian finally understood the terror of the Nine Desolate Lands.

“Never again will I go to the Nine Desolate Lands. Too damned dangerous!” Luo Tian no longer observed Li Cheng'en’s battle, his cultivation fully unleashed as he transformed into a black line and vanished beyond Broken Soul Cliff.

People from the Lei Domain within a hundred miles of Broken Soul Cliff gradually returned. These were those who had fled into the void first.

Colorful lights flashed in the sky, and Luo Tian’s black line blended among them, going unnoticed by the Lei Domain's late-stage saints.

This attack on the Four Sacred Star Domains had brought six late-stage saints, nearly ten million superiors and supreme beings. Such a terrifying force could leave anyone in awe.

The remaining four late-stage saints continuously issued commands to their mid-level saint subordinates, gathering the returning people. They gazed at the mist-wrapped Broken Soul Cliff, feeling waves of terror in their minds. These waves made them tense, for it was a saint at the peak level—this one old ancestor was the core of this attack on the Four Sacred Star Domains, equivalent to all of them combined.

“Grandfather must not be harmed!” The people of the Lei Domain showed concern, praying for Li Cheng'en’s safe return.

Roars echoed through the sky. At the middle of Broken Soul Cliff, battles raged. The heavens themselves seemed to churn. Li Cheng'en, a saint at the peak level, wielded a pseudo-Epoch Treasure sword. It was like holding golden lightning, severely restraining the beast born from an Epoch-level powerhouse’s flesh. Each strike caused white smoke to rise and the beast to howl.

Luo Tian didn’t immediately leave. He remained hidden among the Lei Domain’s army, observing Li Cheng'en's battle with the gray-furred beast.

The distance from Broken Soul Cliff was too great. As the woman disappeared, Luo Tian’s vision dropped again. Even with his Purple Extreme Demon Eye, he couldn’t see Li Cheng'en's battle. He could only hear the thunderous sounds echoing in his mind.

The fluctuation lasted for an entire half-day. Finally, a battered figure emerged from the mist, causing the Lei Domain people to immediately tense.

Gray energy radiated from the old man’s body, falling into their sight. The pitiful and battered figure made people gasp.

“Grandfather!” But they recognized the old man as their Lei Domain’s Grandfather, Li Cheng'en.

“Old turtle! You still didn’t die!” Luo Tian’s face showed shock. Even the flesh of an Epoch-level powerhouse with consciousness couldn’t kill Li Cheng'en.

“I’m fine. I need to heal. Don’t disturb me! Once my injuries recover, I’ll destroy the Four Sacred Star Domains!” Li Cheng'en’s eyes flashed with murderous intent as he spoke. In an instant, he vanished from their sight.

“Grandfather! This injury is severe. We’ve never seen Grandfather so eager to heal. A saint at the peak level, injured like this!” The people of the Lei Domain showed a hint of admiration, gazing at Li Cheng'en’s vanished figure.

Luo Tian stood among the crowd. He sighed at the danger of Broken Soul Cliff, his eyes showing contemplation. Without a saint at the peak level, the Lei Domain’s power was no longer their greatest support. This was the best opportunity to attack.

Thinking this, Luo Tian couldn’t sit still. He vanished silently from the crowd, transforming into a streak of light and flying toward the Tianyuan Continent.

Along the way, Luo Tian took out his identity jade token to send a message to Wei Mingxuan and Sha Cangmang, ordering them to gather their forces and prepare for a preemptive strike against the Lei Domain.

On the Tianyuan Continent, Sha Cangmang, Wei Mingxuan, and Zhang Ziping all showed shock. Their faces bore a hint of joy.

“Order everyone to gather on the Tianyuan Continent! We’ll make the Lei Domain run away in disgrace!” Their eyes showed a hint of satisfaction, growling low.

“Haha! Finally, I can go out and fight them! Damn it, these days have really made me bored! The Lei Domain’s bastards think we’re easy prey. This time, if I don’t beat them so badly they don’t recognize their father, I won’t be Wang…”

“Yes! These bastards aren’t human. They even target commoners, trying to exterminate the Four Sacred Star Domains completely!” Roars echoed, people moving and gathering.

Chapter 1034: Two Domains' War

In the starry sky outside the Tianyuan Continent, figures continuously gathered. Their faces all bore strong battle intent. Under the organization of major sects, they stood orderly, their overwhelming battle spirit rising.

A total of fifteen million superiors and supreme beings. Saint-level warriors were not counted. This was the strongest force the Four Sacred Star Domains could gather at this moment. After all, most people hadn’t matured yet. Having such a number in just a few years was astonishing. If others knew, they would be shocked. The future of the Four Sacred Star Domains was terrifying.

Wei Mingxuan, Sha Cangmang, and Luo Xiong stood there. Their faces showed a grim determination, waiting for Luo Tian’s arrival.

“Finally, we can take revenge!” Zheng Xin, Wan Lingkong, and Nan Gong Yuqing showed coldness. The Lei Domain and the Four Sacred Star Domains were now enemies.

Since the Lei Domain attacked the Four Sacred Star Domains, the latter had suffered heavy losses. Countless continents and sects were destroyed by the Lei Domain. Their approach was so ruthless it could be described as “no grass grows.”

In the world of cultivators, wars were common. But the Lei Domain’s approach of not sparing even commoners was clearly to erase the Four Sacred Star Domains from the Nine Domains, leaving no chance for recovery. It was too cruel. Even the Yin Domain, which had once caused chaos in the Nine Domains, left some seeds for survival. Though it was to collect life essence later, the Four Sacred Star Domains still existed.

The overwhelming battle spirit and killing intent intertwined. Anyone facing this killing intent would retreat, even a late-stage saint.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian’s figure appeared in their sight. Everyone’s eyes briefly widened, then showed admiration.

Luo Tian was no longer just a symbol of the Tianyuan Continent. He had become a symbol of the entire Four Sacred Star Domains. Though his cultivation was only at the early stage of a saint, he had defeated several late-stage saints. One late-stage saint had even died at his hands in the Demon Domain.

“Luo Tian!” People roared, their voices filled with fanaticism.

Luo Tian smiled. Under the black sea of eyes from the Four Sacred Star Domains, he spoke softly: “Everyone, the Lei Domain’s peak-level ancestor is now severely wounded. I’ll handle the remaining late-stage saints of the Lei Domain. The rest of the battle will rely on you all. If we win, the Four Sacred Star Domains can continue to stand in the Nine Domains. If we lose, it will mean our destruction. Today is the Lei Domain; tomorrow could be another domain. To survive, we must kill our enemies!”

Luo Tian’s voice wasn’t loud but echoed in the silent starry sky, instantly stirring their emotions.

“Kill…” A low roar erupted from the 1.5 million people, echoing through the starry sky across the Four Sacred Star Domains. Almost every continent in the Four Sacred Star Domains heard this thunderous roar.

“Is the Four Sacred Star Domains attacking now?” Many of the Four Sacred Star Domains who hadn’t yet gathered felt excitement, gazing at the rolling heavens.

“Where is this? Has the Four Sacred Star Domains launched an attack?” Those from the Lei Domain who had just left Tongtian Cliff showed disbelief, sensing this overwhelming killing intent.

“It’s impossible. How could the Four Sacred Star Domains have such a strong killing intent? They were said to be weak!” The Lei Domain’s people felt anxious. This battle spirit far exceeded their expectations.

“Hmph, what does it matter? A domain without late-stage saints or peak-level saints is still weak. We four can definitely suppress these people!” Four late-stage saints spoke coldly, their voices filled with disdain.

“Indeed. It must be that the Four Sacred Star Domains heard about Grandfather’s injury and want to take advantage of it. They’re thinking too highly of themselves! We still have four late-stage saints as top elders. What do they have to fight against us?” The Lei Domain’s people saw the four late-stage saints and regained confidence. Four late-stage saints could change the entire battle.

“Let’s go. We’ll finish these Four Sacred Star Domains and save Grandfather the trouble! Let’s wipe them out completely!” The four late-stage saints’ top elders showed a hint of cruelty.

The sound of thunder echoed. The entire starry sky trembled as the Four Sacred Star Domains’ people surged like a flood toward Broken Soul Cliff.

On the other side, millions of Lei Domain disciples also roared back. Like a sea of lightning, they were filled with battle spirit and flew toward the Tianyuan Continent.

The distance between both sides gradually closed, a pressing atmosphere rising in their hearts.

This battle was the most difficult and largest one the Four Sacred Star Domains had ever experienced. Even the weakest combatants were at the supreme level, something unprecedented for the Four Sacred Star Domains.

Two floods of people, guided by fate, met each other after half a day. They stood facing each other.

“This…” The Lei Domain people were stunned, gazing at the Four Sacred Star Domains’ people who outnumbered them by almost double. Their eyes were red with rage, looking at them. They felt a hint of fear.

“Four Sacred Star Domains! Today is your day of extinction!” The four late-stage saints’ top elders felt a slight tension. They hadn’t expected the Four Sacred Star Domains to develop so quickly. A few years ago, they were weak and had no superiors. Now, they were filled with strong warriors.

Even so, the four late-stage saints’ top elders looked down on the Four Sacred Star Domains. They shouted loudly.

“Old dog, if you want to exterminate the Four Sacred Star Domains, see if your teeth are hard enough!” Luo Tian’s body was surrounded by demonic aura. He stood at the front of the crowd, his voice cold.

“Haha! Haha! A lowly early-stage saint dares to talk like this. The Four Sacred Star Domains really don’t have brains!” One of the late-stage saints showed disdain, speaking to Luo Tian.

“Haha! Though I’m at early-stage saint, though I am an ant, I can kill you like slaughtering a dog!” Luo Tian responded loudly. He threw a rare divine medicine into his mouth, crunching it.

“That’s a rare divine medicine!” The four late-stage saints saw Luo Tian wasting it, their faces showing shock. They hadn’t expected the Four Sacred Star Domains to have such a rare treasure.

“Kid, you won’t die. I’ll catch you and extract the medicine’s power from your body!” One of the late-stage saints showed a hot gaze, looking at Luo Tian as if he were a treasure.

“Let me kill you first!” Luo Tian didn’t want to waste words. He took out his back’s Shangtian Bow, drew his bow, and shot a black demonic arrow.

“Burst…” The string trembled. It was like the prelude to death, making the four late-stage saints instantly feel a strong sense of danger.

Especially the one who had wanted to refine Luo Tian, his face suddenly changed. He felt locked by that black light and hadn’t even had time to react before the black arrow appeared in front of his chest.

“Pf…” No surprise, this Lei Domain late-stage saint turned into a cloud of blood mist before the eyes of over two million people.

“Sigh…” A sound of drawing in cold air echoed through the starry sky. Both sides had different expressions, their faces filled with shock.

“That bow…” The Lei Domain people saw Luo Tian’s Shangtian Bow and suddenly realized something, their eyes locking onto Luo Tian.

“His name is Luo Tian!” Someone in the Lei Domain shouted, causing the entire Lei Domain to erupt.

“He’s Luo Tian! The rumors were true. One arrow and he blew up a late-stage saint!” The Lei Domain people showed fear.

“Haha! Luo Tian’s might!” In contrast, the Four Sacred Star Domains’ side roared in unison. Their eyes were filled with fanaticism. One arrow blowing up a late-stage saint was how mighty! The entire Four Sacred Star Domains’ side instantly ignited, their momentum surging through the stars.

The remaining three late-stage saints fell silent. Their eyes showed intense fear. They hadn’t expected it to be Luo Tian. How could they not have heard of him? The number of late-stage saints killed by Luo Tian was definitely over five.

“Kill!” Before the three late-stage saints could react, Luo Tian raised his Zhaitean Spear. His body radiated golden light. A golden Epoch Bell appeared before Luo Tian, its sound echoing like waves, announcing the start of the battle.

“Kill!” A unified voice rose from the Four Sacred Star Domains’ side, making the Lei Domain people’s minds tremble. An invisible fear arose in their hearts.

“Kill!” The three late-stage saints also roared, but now there was no other choice. They only hoped their peak-level ancestor would return quickly. Then the world would instantly turn around.

Previously, with four late-stage saints, they had some confidence. But now that Luo Tian was involved, the remaining three felt uncertain. The rumors of Luo Tian were too terrifying for them to ignore.

Two sides collided like two rivers, creating a thunderous fluctuation. The entire starry sky began to collapse in pieces. Brilliant martial arts clashed in the stars, and the terrifying fluctuation caused many supreme beings to die. Life was worthless before war.

Chapter 1035: Slaughter

In the starry sky of the Four Sacred Star Domains, the total number of combatants from both sides was nearly twenty million. Two floods collided.

As soon as they met, countless people died. War resembled a meat grinder, with lives dying every moment. The starry sky continuously collapsed, and severed limbs fell from the stars.

High-level combatants separated from the superior and supreme battlefields. Luo Tian led his group to clash with the Lei Domain’s saint-level warriors.

“Luo Tian!” The remaining three late-stage saints instantly locked onto Luo Tian, their eyes filled with endless killing intent. They transformed into three lightning beams and rushed toward Luo Tian.

Other Lei Domain saints also found their opponents, facing each other. Here was the key to winning the entire battle, especially the three late-stage saints who posed a massive threat.

“Three late-stage saints!” Luo Tian’s face showed seriousness. He grabbed the Shangtian Bow.

Three late-stage saints attacking simultaneously was deadly for Luo Tian. He could shoot one arrow to block a late-stage saint, but he would still face the other two. He couldn’t withstand it. The Epoch Bell and Spirit-Transportation Cauldron could block damage, but he would definitely be severely injured.

“Haha! Brother, I’ll hold one for you!” Zhang Ziping held the Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword. His face showed strong battle spirit, his eyes fearless like a god of war as he rushed toward a late-stage saint.

“Little brother, rely on yourself!” The other two, Lei Yong and Ji Chen, also radiated battle spirit. Their eyes showed encouragement as they gazed at Luo Tian.

Zhang Ziping, Lei Yong, and Ji Chen were Luo Tian’s older brothers. Their cultivation was naturally not poor. They had advanced to the middle stage of a saint, their strength was terrifying. Though they couldn’t match late-stage saints, they could hold one.

“Old brothers, I’ll help you!” Gu Qianxue, Leng Qiuchan, and Jiang Si three women also radiated momentum. Three elegant figures followed Zhang Ziping, surrounding the late-stage saint.

“We’ll help too!” Zheng Xin and Nan Gong Yuqing among other top talents roared, their eyes cold. A group of people completely surrounded the late-stage saint.

“Haha! Without a pseudo-Epoch Treasure, you little scum at the middle and early stages of saints think you can block me!” The Lei Domain’s late-stage saint saw the group surrounding him, his eyes slightly tense. But then he showed disdain.

The gap in levels was significant unless filled by a pseudo-Epoch Treasure or if one were an extraordinary talent with the potential of an Epoch Master. Otherwise, a single level difference was like a mountain.

The old man surrounded by the group showed no fear. He raised his hand, sending a sea of lightning toward Zhang Ziping’s group. The massive pressure instantly made them stop.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows. The best solution was for someone to block one and let him deal with the other two.

But these people were his closest relatives. Luo Tian was still afraid they might suffer an accident.

“Crack…” The Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword emitted ten thousand golden lights. Lei Yong and others also used martial arts, blocking the old man’s lightning sea. But it cost them a pale face.

“Brother, take this!” Luo Tian worried about their injuries. He sent the Spirit-Transportation Cauldron toward Zhang Ziping.

“Pseudo-Epoch Treasure!” The late-stage saint’s face slightly changed. He formed a hand seal, sending ten thousand lightning swords toward them.

Zhang Ziping didn’t hesitate. He knew how important these people were to Luo Tian. He slapped the Spirit-Transportation Cauldron, spilling ten thousand glows of light that enveloped them.

“Boom…” Thunder roared. Ten thousand lightning swords fell like rain on the Spirit-Transportation Cauldron, blocking the old man’s martial arts.

Luo Tian sighed deeply. Seeing them unharmed, his face showed a hint of killing intent. He grabbed the Shangtian Bow and shot an arrow. A rare divine medicine could support him to shoot five arrows, giving him confidence to kill the two late-stage saints.

“Die!” Luo Tian drew his bow and aimed at a late-stage saint hundreds of feet away.

The late-stage saint locked by Luo Tian suddenly stopped. His face slightly changed, a wave of death instantly invading his mind.

“Lightning Shield!” The old man’s face showed madness. He formed hand seals, sending lightning to surround himself. Lightning formed a light shield that covered him before he moved, his speed unchanged as he rushed toward Luo Tian.

The other old man also used the same defensive martial art, rushing toward Luo Tian. Obviously, they wanted to kill him in one strike, even if it meant heavy injury.

The black demonic arrow pierced the sky. It instantly reached the old man’s front, colliding with his lightning shield.

“Crack…” The lightning shield shattered like glass. It scattered into countless lightning, rushing outward.

At the same time, the arrow pierced the old man’s chest. His face turned pale immediately. But due to the lightning shield, he wasn’t blown up but severely injured.

“Little scum! Die!” The other old man, unharmed, showed fierce killing intent. Lightning formed a hammer and smashed toward Luo Tian. This strike could kill any middle-stage saint, even if they were top talents, they would inevitably die in this hammer.

The old man who was injured also gritted his teeth and launched his strongest strike.

Two thunderbolts, like a heavenly punishment, rushed toward Luo Tian. His face suddenly changed.

“Epoch Bell!” Luo Tian roared. If he relied on his own strength, he would definitely die. But with the Epoch Bell, he had a chance to fight against the two late-stage saints.

“Dong…” The heavy bell sound rang. Luo Tian stood under the bell, not caring about the two old men’s attacks and continued to draw his bow.

“Crack…” The golden lightning hammer smashed against the Epoch Bell. Two thunderbolts also fell, striking the bell’s surface.

Thunderbolts surged. The entire Epoch Bell was surrounded by a sea of lightning, its fierce energy even erasing the two old men’s spiritual senses.

“Little scum! Even with a pseudo-Epoch Treasure protecting you, in our two full attacks, you won’t die. But you’ll definitely be severely injured and unable to continue fighting!” The old man wounded by Luo Tian showed a sinister expression, gazing at the Epoch Bell immersed in lightning.

“Burst…” But in an instant, the old man’s face suddenly turned pale. His expression showed disbelief.
