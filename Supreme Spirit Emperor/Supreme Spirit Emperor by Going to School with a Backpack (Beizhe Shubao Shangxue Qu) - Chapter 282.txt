“Cough...” However, before Jiang Nanxuan could speak, Diaoyuanshan, standing beside the two, suddenly changed his expression. He let out a few soft coughs, and an old body began to emit faint divine pattern cracks. A stream of purple qi emerged from the fissures, continuously siphoning Diaoyuanshan's vitality.

“My time has come! From now on, I entrust my disciple Diaoyuanshan to you!” Diaoyuanshan panted heavily, cold sweat streaming down his forehead. His gaze fell upon Luotian.

“Master Diaoyuan!” Luotian's face shifted instantly, appearing at Diaoyuanshan’s side and supporting him. His expression bore deep concern, his heart filled with anxiety.

Diaoyuanshan was originally a powerhouse. Since encountering Diaoyuanshan, he had repeatedly risked his life to save Luotian and others. Luotian never forgot this debt of gratitude. This time, Diaoyuanshan had even used a forbidden technique to protect them—how could Luotian bear such guilt?

Longjie's face was cold. He extended his hand, and droplets of blood surged into Diaoyuanshan's body, reviving him with vitality.

Luotian also unleashed his reincarnation blood, which flowed into Diaoyuanshan's body. His complexion improved significantly.

Xinglongyiyanjun, too, did not hesitate. As a descendant of an epoch master's lineage, he directly released his blood into Diaoyuanshan’s body.

The three of them—Luotian, Longjie, and Xinglongyiyanjun—had blood imbued with divine power and vitality. Yet even their combined efforts could not halt the siphoning of Diaoyuanshan’s vitality by the surging purple qi.

Zheng Xin, Gu Lei, Xu Liyi, and others were frantic like ants on a hot pan. Though their talents were remarkable, they paled in comparison to Luotian’s three. Even their blood could only delay the inevitable, revealing how formidable Diaoyuanshan's forbidden technique was—enough to defy heaven and challenge an epoch mid-level master.

Diaoyuanshan had bestowed immense gratitude upon each of them, so all sought ways to save him.

“No use. Once a forbidden technique is unleashed, only an epoch master’s miraculous intervention can stop it. Otherwise, no one can withstand it,” Diaoyuanshan chuckled softly, his gaze tenderly resting on Luotian and Longjie. He stopped them from further draining their blood.

Jiang Nanxuan did not hesitate, releasing two petals of the divine demon flower from his body—black and white. They soared into Diaoyuanshan’s form.

The immortal herbs, each a boundless source of vitality, were akin to eternal life, cultivated by epoch masters. They could sustain two epochs but failed to alter Diaoyuanshan’s fate. Yet with the addition of the two petals, his complexion stabilized, and his breath steadied. The cracks on his body diminished significantly. Though vitality still faded, it had improved vastly—no immediate danger remained.

“Still no good! Vitality continues to drain. We must think of another way!” Luotian observed Diaoyuanshan’s lingering vitality, his mind racing.

“This is already remarkable. At this rate, I still have decades of life,” Diaoyuanshan smiled, shaking his head. He refused the desperate efforts of Luotian and others, not wanting them to overexert themselves. Overexertion would harm their future cultivation.

“No! There must be a way. Epoch Master! Epoch Master!” Luotian muttered, his eyes filled with determination. The only epoch master he had encountered was Meng Lingyun.

“Roar…” As Luotian and the others pondered how to save Diaoyuanshan, Dongbo Xin finally completed his massacre. A total of 15 million cultivators were slain—only a few saint-level masters escaped initially, and another million near the edge managed to flee. All others were obliterated by Dongbo Xin.

“Terrifying! An epoch late-stage powerhouse has reached such a level!” Their eyes reflected shock. A million lives had vanished in an instant, leaving Luotian deeply moved.

His crimson eyes flashed lightning, and he bathed in the blood sea, absorbing boundless blood qi into his body.

Then, Dongbo Xin turned his gaze toward Luotian and the others, making them feel as if plunged into ice. They were like commoners under the gaze of a ferocious beast, ready to end their lives at any moment.

“Ding…” Jiang Nanxuan’s face was pale. He had expended two divine demon petals, a heavy toll. But he had no choice—only he could possibly awaken or stop Dongbo Xin.

The melody of a zither echoed through the starry sky, entering Dongbo Xin’s ears. Simultaneously, Jiang Nanxuan’s body radiated waves of black and white qi, eventually transforming into the form of a divine demon flower. It soared toward Dongbo Xin’s towering figure.

The zither’s melody was elegant, and upon hearing it, Dongbo Xin’s crimson eyes gradually gained a touch of black and white qi. His mind cleared slightly, standing motionless without attacking Luotian’s group.

“Woo…” The illusion of the divine demon flower, formed from black and white qi, descended slowly. It finally imprinted itself on Dongbo Xin’s forehead, merging into his body.

“Roar…” As the divine demon flower vanished, the blood qi swirling around Dongbo Xin gradually calmed. Black and white qi began to slowly exit his body.

Black, white, red—three energies clashed outside Dongbo Xin’s form, vying for dominance.

“Ah…” Dongbo Xin clutched his head, and the black and white domain materialized around him. His overwhelming aura pushed Luotian’s group back a thousand feet, drawing blood from their mouths.

“Roar…” Ultimately, the three energies formed a balance around Dongbo Xin, restoring a glimmer of clarity to his face.

“I must leave! If I go mad, that altar cannot contain me!” Dongbo Xin addressed Jiang Nanxuan and Luotian before vanishing into the void.

“Gone, well!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke weakly, his body collapsing uncontrollably into the starry sky. Zheng Xin swiftly moved to support him.

“This powerhouse has left. Many sanctuaries will surely be restless. If he loses control, he could annihilate a sanctuary!” Luotian sighed deeply, unaware of Dongbo Xin’s destination. If he truly went mad in a domain, it would bring annihilation to that region.

Yet Luotian observed Dongbo Xin’s condition—three energies intertwined in a strange manner, suggesting he had some control over his mind.

Chapter 1182: Re-entering the Ancient Heaven Palace

Under the starry sky of the Fire Domain, Luotian and others watched Dongbo Xin vanish into the void. They sighed, unsure of his destination.

Dongbo Xin was a prodigy; Luotian and the others did not fear for his safety. Rather, they worried about the sanctuaries and clans. If Dongbo Xin lost control in a domain, it would be catastrophic.

The greatest concern was Diaoyuanshan’s condition. Having used a forbidden technique, if Jiang Nanxuan had not unleashed two immortal herbs, Diaoyuanshan would already be in the void. Even now, his vitality faded slowly. Without a solution, he would die within decades.

“Meng Lingyun!” Luotian could think of no other solution but Meng Lingyun. He recalled the residual soul of Meng Lingyun, who had once resided in the Epoch Book. As for the Epoch Book itself, Luotian had never considered it—since obtaining it, the book had acted like a lord, and he still hadn’t mastered its full power.

Yet Luotian knew that as the number of pages in the Epoch Book increased, its power grew stronger. If he could harness it, it would be his greatest life-saving ace, comparable to the Ancient Heaven Palace.

“Kill!” As Luotian pondered, a battle cry echoed in his ears, causing their expressions to shift slightly.

“Is the Mortal Domain returning?” Their minds trembled, eyes filled with tension. At this moment, they were exhausted—especially Luotian, Longjie, Yanjun, and Jiang Nanxuan. They had risked their lives to save Diaoyuanshan, leaving them at their weakest.

“Boom…” The starry sky trembled as cries of battle rose. A group appeared before them, and upon seeing the intruders, Luotian’s group sighed in relief, their faces lighting up.

The intruders were not from the Mortal Domain but reinforcements from the Four Sacred Domains and Fire Domain. Leading them was the headmasters of three great sects, along with Luo Xiong and Sha Cangmang.

“Luotian!” Upon seeing Luotian’s group, bloodied and exhausted, even Diaoyuanshan pale and standing there, along with the lingering blood river, they understood how fierce their battle had been.

“Nothing serious. Let’s return first!” Luotian waved, supported by Gu Qianxue and Leng Qiuchan. They followed the group toward Tongtianshan.

Seeing their disheveled state, the others did not inquire further but escorted them back to Tongtianshan. Upon arrival, Luotian’s group immediately retreated for healing, briefly recounting their battle.

As they healed, the Fire Domain grew tense again—no one knew when the Mortal Domain would strike.

On the third day of their healing, news spread across nine domains: the Mortal Domain had annihilated 15 million in the Fire Domain. This triumphant first strike was exhilarating.

The name “Dongbo Xin” spread across nine domains. An epoch late-stage powerhouse, with no saint-level masters in the nine domains except for clan resources, was unparalleled. Even if the Mortal Domain emerged, it could not handle Dongbo Xin. A thousand and five million annihilated by one man—such power made people feel the might of an epoch late-stage master.

The Mortal Domain, seemingly defeated, did not reappear in the Fire Domain, disappointing those who had come to aid. They returned to their own domains.

On the seventh day of Luotian’s retreat, a shocking revelation erupted again after news of the Fire Domain attack.

The Mortal Domain’s Nine Saints, led by Ming Yongzhi, along with nine saint princes and over a thousand saint-level masters, launched an attack on the Thunder Domain.

This news shook nine domains. The Thunder Domain ranked only below the Fire Domain, but with two saint elders deceased, its highest current cultivation was saint-level. Whether it harbored hidden power like Gu Tianshi or Dongbo Xin remained unknown.

People marveled at the Mortal Domain’s strength—after losing 15 million, it had regrouped with another 15 million. Such terrifying power could annihilate any of the other eight domains. If not for Dongbo Xin’s emergence, the Fire Domain might have already been destroyed.

People knew the Thunder Domain was in danger. Without hidden resources, it had no choice but to face annihilation. Its current strength was even weaker than the Fire Domain.

At the previous eight-domain alliance meeting, they had formed a pact to build a transmission array connecting all domains. If one domain was in trouble, the other seven would send aid. Thus, upon hearing of the Mortal Domain’s attack on the Thunder Domain, Starfield Domain, Chaos Domain, Revenant Domain, and God-Demon Domain dispatched aid.

The Fire Domain did not send help—after the previous attack, its elite forces were severely depleted and in retreat. Also, they feared the Mortal Domain might strike while they aided another domain.

Another domain that did not send aid was the Beast Domain, as its elders had returned injured. Even the Beast Domain’s treasure, the Emperor Mirror, returned two days after their elders’ return.

On the tenth day of his retreat, Luotian emerged from seclusion. His injuries had healed, but his face remained pale—loss of blood could not be recovered in days.

As Luotian stepped out, all domain leaders gathered to greet him—first to check his recovery, second to seek advice on whether to aid the Thunder Domain.

Luotian sat in the hall, pale-faced, listening to their accounts. His brows furrowed. He could imagine the storm the Thunder Domain faced.

Li Tianzhi’s strength was trustworthy, especially with Star River Four Thieves—elite warriors who could fight two against one. Yet the Mortal Domain was too powerful. Even with aid from other domains, the Thunder Domain’s elite forces were far behind.

“Support them, but I cannot go yet. I must enter the Ancient Heaven Palace with Master Diaoyuan. Once I return, I’ll decide!” Luotian said and headed toward Diaoyuanshan’s residence.

Under the reverent gaze of two domains, Luotian arrived at Diaoyuanshan’s residence. His expression was respectful as he stepped into the courtyard.

The courtyard was quiet, and Diaoyuanshan’s face was calm, as if he had transcended life and death. Though previously aged, his aura had been sharp—now it was tranquil.

He picked up a stone teacup, sipped tea, and saw Luotian enter. “I must leave. Though my strength has declined, those old men cannot harm me. I need to return and lay the path for Longzu and others!”

Diaoyuanshan’s eyes flashed cold, recalling the cruelty of several Beast Domain elders. He seemed to return to his former domineering self.

“Master, do not rush. I will take you somewhere—perhaps there is a solution to your injuries!” Luotian spoke softly, concern etched on his face.

“As for Diaoyuanshan, rest assured. Once I send you in, I’ll head to the Beast Domain. Those old men will be dealt with!” Luotian continued, assuring Diaoyuanshan to focus on healing.

“Ah?” Diaoyuanshan’s eyes brightened, gazing at Luotian. He knew Luotian had extraordinary opportunities, so upon hearing his words, his heart—once calm—stirred. Who wouldn’t want to live longer?

Luotian wasted no words, waved his hand, and the Ancient Heaven Palace materialized above him and Diaoyuanshan. Golden palace transformed into a house-sized form, radiating light.

Luotian’s hands moved, and a golden holy force key emerged from his palm, plunging into the Ancient Heaven Palace. The palace’s gate slowly opened.

“Come on, Master Diaoyuan—have you never entered the Ancient Heaven Palace before?” Luotian smiled, addressing Diaoyuanshan. At the same time, their figures ascended and entered the golden palace’s gate.

“Woo…” A transmission force activated, and Luotian and Diaoyuanshan appeared in the first level of the Ancient Heaven Palace.

The first level was empty, but Luotian had entered before—being the Ancient Heaven Palace’s master, he could go anywhere with a thought.

The hum returned, and their figures appeared beneath the starry sky—the same spot where Qiling Meng Lingxiao had buried Meng Lingyun’s jade coffin.

Upon appearing in the starry sky, Qiling Meng Lingxiao and three sub-qi spirits appeared beside Luotian. They bowed slightly, gazing at Luotian.

“Elders, I wish to open Master Meng’s jade coffin and seek his advice on an issue!” Luotian spoke respectfully.

“Hmm?” Upon hearing this, Qiling Meng Lingxiao’s brows furrowed slightly. He glanced at Diaoyuanshan, sensing his fading vitality. Though reluctant, he nodded—Luotian was their master now, and they could not defy him.

With Qiling Meng Lingxiao’s approval, Luotian led Diaoyuanshan into the starry sky, appearing beside the Tiancan Xuan Jade Coffin.

Chapter 1183: Meeting Meng Lingyun

Within the Ancient Heaven Palace, a green jade coffin hovered in the starry sky. Luotian and Diaoyuanshan stood before it, their gazes respectful—especially Diaoyuanshan, whose face was filled with reverence and excitement.

Epoch Masters were legendary figures, leaving countless tales across nine domains. Their power was unparalleled, yet their fates remained mysteries. Some said they ascended to immortality, others that they eventually succumbed to time, relying on immortal herbs for two epochs before dissolving. Diaoyuanshan never expected to witness such a mighty being—though not the true body of an Epoch Master, it was enough to excite him.

Qiling Meng Lingxiao and three sub-qi spirits bore respectful expressions, standing behind Luotian. They too wished to know how much Meng Lingyun had recovered.

“Respectful disciple Luotian seeks an audience. Today, I open the ancient coffin—please do not blame me!” Luotian spoke respectfully to Meng Lingyun, though unsure if he could hear.

Luotian waited, but the jade coffin showed no reaction. He extended his hand, pushing against its immense pressure to reach it. His arms strained—though now a saint-level master, his strength was vastly different from before.

“Open!” Luotian roared, veins bulging as he pushed the coffin lid with his formidable body.

Luotian was now the Ancient Heaven Palace’s master, and its power had greatly enhanced him. Even an epoch early-stage master would struggle to defeat him within it.

“Creak…” Under Luotian’s full effort, the green jade coffin’s lid finally opened in Diaoyuanshan’s excited gaze.

Light burst forth, vitality spread, and a surge of life energy erupted from the coffin, enveloping the area in green.

The boundless vitality filled this small starry sky, making Luotian and Diaoyuanshan’s faces flush with color.

“Indeed, the resting place of an Epoch Master!” Diaoyuanshan murmured in awe, his respect deepening. His body then sank slightly as the pressure from the coffin’s opening overwhelmed him, making his breath feel heavy. It was like a commoner standing before the heavens—uncomparable.

“Even an Epoch Master who has perished still holds such power! How terrifying would a true Epoch Master be!” Diaoyuanshan’s awe was boundless, and he spoke.

Diaoyuanshan did not know that if not for Luotian being the Ancient Heaven Palace’s master, reducing its pressure significantly, even a mid-epoch strength would find it difficult to approach this coffin.

“That’s right! Our master was once so mighty, known as the Lord of Lingyun, who subdued nine heavens and ten earths. His command was absolute—no domain dared defy him!” Qiling Meng Lingxiao spoke proudly, his gaze deep as he looked at the half-body of Meng Lingyun within the coffin.

Luotian and Diaoyuanshan also gazed at the coffin, having seen it before. Now, Luotian was curious about Meng Lingyun’s recovery state.

But upon looking, he felt disappointment—this half-body was no different from before. Golden runes flowed at the severed section, and Meng Lingyun’s solemn face had his eyes closed tightly. Unless one felt closely, the faintest breath was barely perceptible.

Seeing Meng Lingyun’s body, Qiling Meng Lingxiao also bore a hint of disappointment. Yet he sighed softly: “Master has already perished. Recovery will take years, and whether it happens is uncertain.”

Luotian nodded gently. He knew Meng Lingyun’s injuries were severe. If not for bringing his residual soul and using reincarnation blood to awaken the half-body’s faint vitality, along with immortal herbs and other sacred medicines, Meng Lingyun might have already died.

“Sigh… If Master Meng recovers, the nine domains’ crisis would be resolved!” Luotian sighed deeply. If Meng Lingyun recovered, who could oppose him? The Mortal Domain, external enemies—all would be crushed.

“Luotian, your thoughts are incorrect!” As Luotian’s words ended, a voice echoed. Meng Lingyun’s body released a faint illusion, his gaze filled with amusement as he looked at Luotian.

“Master!” Luotian immediately knelt in the starry sky, as did Diaoyuanshan. This was respect for an Epoch Master—regardless of Meng Lingyun’s current state, he had once been one. Qiling Meng Lingxiao and the three sub-qi spirits did not need to be told—they were overjoyed, speechless.

“Live in the present and conquer all enemies. You must have this unyielding belief to advance further in cultivation!” Meng Lingyun spoke, his spirit slightly more solid than before.

Though it was just a residual thought, the aura of an Epoch Master—unparalleled and lonely—remained.

“Respectfully noted!” Luotian bowed, then turned to Diaoyuanshan kneeling there.

“Respectful disciple came here for my elder—does Master have a method to heal those who used forbidden techniques?” Luotian asked again, his gaze filled with hope.

“Forbidden technique?” Meng Lingyun gazed at Diaoyuanshan kneeling there, observing the purple qi emanating from his body. His brows furrowed slightly but soon relaxed, a smile on his face.

“A minor issue. There are no forbidden techniques in the world—just bodies unable to withstand and retaliate. Let him stay here for a while. If he reached epoch early-stage in this era, his talent must be remarkable. As for when he recovers—depends on himself!” Meng Lingyun spoke softly, making Luotian overjoyed.

Diaoyuanshan’s face also bore excitement, his heart stunned by Meng Lingyun’s power. Even one who had used a forbidden technique could be healed—truly unparalleled.

“Thank you, Master!” Diaoyuanshan spoke respectfully, addressing Meng Lingyun. This was saving his life.

“No need to thank me. If not for this boy, I would not have recovered so much!” Meng Lingyun waved his hand dismissively, indicating Luotian and the others to rise.

“Master, how long until you fully recover?” Qiling Meng Lingxiao stood up, asking the question on everyone’s mind.

“How long? I don’t know. I was already dead, with only a thread of life and a fragment of spirit left. Whether I recover is uncertain. Don’t even mention full recovery—should I truly recover, I doubt I’ll reach the level of an Epoch Master. The era no longer belongs to me!” Meng Lingyun sighed softly.

Though Luotian had prepared for this, hearing Meng Lingyun could not recover to an Epoch Master left him sighing. The once-unstoppable being now lay in this state—perhaps Meng Lingyun himself felt the most pain.

“Rest easy, all past matters are but clouds. I am content with this state!” Meng Lingyun shook his head, and his illusory spirit waved a hand. Green qi spread, infinite vitality forming runes that enveloped Diaoyuanshan.

Diaoyuanshan did not resist, allowing the green vitality to envelop him and enter his body.

“Enter!” Meng Lingyun extended his hand, pulling the unresisting Diaoyuanshan into the jade coffin. He sat beside his half-body.

“Done. Tell me what happened recently!” Meng Lingyun smiled, speaking again. He knew that only a major event could have made an epoch early-stage master like Diaoyuanshan use a forbidden technique.

As Meng Lingyun spoke, he extended his hand again, and the small tree of immortal herbs rooted in the coffin flew out three leaves. They soared into Luotian’s body.

“Woo…” The leaves entered Luotian’s body, and his face suddenly turned red. His blood flow accelerated, his heart beat stronger—his lost blood gradually recovered.

“The Mortal Domain has stirred!” Luotian sighed deeply, gazing at Meng Lingyun.

As his words ended, the illusory Meng Lingyun’s face shifted. His eyes flashed cold, and Qiling Meng Lingxiao and the three sub-qi spirits bore intense killing intent. If not for the Nine Saints of the Mortal Domain, Meng Lingyun would not be in this state.

“Be careful. Those nine are no simple foes. Perhaps someone else is behind them!” Meng Lingyun furrowed his brows, recalling his own ordeal.

Once a mighty Epoch Master, Meng Lingyun had been defeated by the Nine Saints of the Mortal Domain. Though he was careless, it showed how formidable the Mortal Domain’s techniques were.

Hearing Meng Lingyun’s words, Luotian felt his pressure increase further.

“Master, have you ever entered the Nine Great Seals?” Luotian asked again, determined to ask all his doubts.

Chapter 1184: Dividing into Two Forces

“Undead creatures?” Upon hearing Luotian’s words, Meng Lingyun was stunned. His gaze turned deep as he looked at Luotian.

“Where did you encounter them?” Meng Lingyun asked, inquiring about the details of Luotian’s meeting with the undead creatures.

Luotian noticed Meng Lingyun’s solemnity—such a reaction from him meant the undead creatures were likely significant. Even the Mortal Domain’s chaos had not made Meng Lingyun so serious.

Luotian did not delay, recounting how he had entered the Fallen Dragon Valley and encountered those undead creatures. He also described the mysterious figure, Shu Feiyang, who claimed to be from the Blood Clan.

Meng Lingyun listened attentively before sighing softly: “Strive to cultivate. Future battles may be even more terrifying than the Mortal Domain’s chaos!”

“Master, could you elaborate on what kind of enemy it is?” Luotian’s eyes showed anxiety. He needed to know who could make Meng Lingyun so concerned.

“A group of terrifying creatures—legendary the Tenth Domain!” Meng Lingyun spoke slowly, gazing at Luotian with concern.

“Tenth Domain?” Luotian was stunned. Since his emergence, he had only known nine domains. None of the records mentioned a Tenth Domain.

“In ancient times, the nine domains were not ruled by humans but by primordial creatures. If I’m not mistaken, those undead creatures you encountered are one of these primordial beings. That young man claiming to be from the Blood Clan is a member of their royal family!” Meng Lingyun spoke, revealing an unknown secret.

“In ancient times, various races thrived, and humans were but a small faction—sometimes even沦为 food for others. It was only after the emergence of Epoch Masters that humans developed, gradually breaking free!”

“Other races never expected food to become so powerful. They felt threatened by the vast human population, but at that time, all primordial kings had already ascended.”

“Human Epoch Masters were as mighty as the primordial kings. One epoch had only one master or king—this was unchangeable. Thus, the first Epoch Master subdued all races, allowing humans to develop.”

“Humans developed rapidly after that. Without the threat of other races, they soon matched other races’ strength.”

Luotian marveled at this unknown history. He felt gratitude toward the first Epoch Master, for without his mighty subjugation, humans would not have thrived.

“Humans honored him as the ‘Breaker of Heaven’—meaning he severed the path to heaven, securing a sky for humans!” Meng Lingyun’s face bore admiration. Even he showed reverence in his gaze.

“Those kings would not accept former food equals to themselves. They remained silent for two epochs, waiting patiently until the Breaker of Heaven ascended. Then, they seized the opportunity to attack humans!”

“War raged endlessly. It was a world-ending battle. Humans, with their vast numbers, faced all races alone. Blood dyed the entire starry sky. The primordial kings never expected humans to develop so swiftly!”

“Yet, despite their strength, humans could not withstand the races’ attack. They retreated step by step, suffering heavy losses!”

“Unexpectedly, when humans were about to give up, a second Epoch Master emerged—‘Severer of Heaven’!”

“Severer of Heaven alone subdued the primordial races, transforming a vast domain into ten domains. He sealed the primordial races within one domain, creating an eternal seal. Thus, nine domains were formed. As for the Tenth Domain, after so many epochs, it has vanished from people’s sight!” Meng Lingyun spoke with deep emotion, recounting the two Epoch Masters who had achieved great feats for humans.

Luotian listened intently, his heart stirred by the two Epoch Masters’ feats—each alone subduing all races. That was truly awe-inspiring.

“The entrance to the Tenth Domain lies deep within the Nine Great Seals! Thus, what you saw in the seals might be those primordial races!” Meng Lingyun continued with a solemn gaze.

“After so many years, the primordial races are ten times more terrifying than the Mortal Domain. If they break free, it would be a disaster for humans in this epoch with few Epoch Masters!” Meng Lingyun gazed at Luotian.

“The world is about to change. These races will vie for the Epoch Master position, seeking their former glory. Especially the kings’ descendants—their bloodlines are extraordinary, each comparable to humans’ nine great cultivations. Be careful!” Meng Lingyun warned Luotian, giving him a sense of urgency.

“However, you still have time. Severer of Heaven’s seal is not easily broken. Even after years of erosion, it remains formidable!” As the last Epoch Master, Meng Lingyun knew best the power of an Epoch Master.

Luotian listened to Meng Lingyun’s words, which seemed light but weighed heavily on his heart. He envisioned the chaos of races emerging and endless battles.

“Enough. Your only task now is to achieve enlightenment. Once you do, you can subdue everything. But your enemies are many—contemporaries and the young heirs of races will all become obstacles on your path to enlightenment!” Meng Lingyun gazed at Luotian, setting high expectations for him.

Luotian smiled bitterly. Achieving enlightenment in this epoch was extremely difficult. If he truly became the strongest Epoch Master during this world-changing era, it might be unprecedented.

“You have the Epoch Book—a supreme sacred artifact. All human Epoch Masters throughout history possessed it. I know so much because of the Epoch Book!” Meng Lingyun spoke again, emphasizing the importance of the Epoch Book.

“Enough. I must return to recover. If I regain strength, I may become your guardian in the future!” Meng Lingyun said before his gray spirit merged into his half-body.

“Respectfully departing!” Luotian’s eyes showed reverence as the jade coffin closed, and he sighed deeply.

“The Mortal Domain has already been a headache. Now this primordial race!” Luotian sighed, his heart heavier than before.
