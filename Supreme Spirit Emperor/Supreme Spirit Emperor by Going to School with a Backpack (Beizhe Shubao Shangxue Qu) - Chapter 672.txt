“Has time truly passed so quickly?” Luo Tian’s eyes showed confusion, feeling he hadn’t been unconscious for long.

“Regretfully, if I had more time, perhaps I could have…” Luo Tian muttered低声, speaking as he vanished into the seventh city.

After the world spun around, Luo Tian appeared outside a grand hall, causing a stir among the people. They gazed at him, bewildered and standing there.

“Out!” A chorus of exclamations filled Luo Tian’s ears. Instantly, a crowd surrounded him.

“Kid, which city did you break through?” Ye Fengdu asked directly, voicing the thoughts of all.

“Seventh city,” Luo Tian replied with regret. “But the time I spent there was short.”

“Hiss…” The sound of people drawing in cold air rose, their gazes toward Luo Tian shifting.

“You saw what?” Bai He and Hei Chao knew some of the secrets of Fengdu Palace, asking this as it was what they had hoped for.

“Six Paths of Reincarnation!” Luo Tian declared, causing Ye Fengdu and the two ghosts’ faces to change, filled with horror.

“Haha, I’ve made a fortune!” Bai He and Hei Chao patted Luo Tian’s shoulder, laughing as if they had gained a great advantage.

“I said it! I guessed it was the Six Paths of Reincarnation, after all, you are…” Bai He laughed as if he had always known Luo Tian would witness the Six Paths of Reincarnation.

“What am I?” Luo Tian’s gaze met Bai He and Hei Chao, causing them to startle. They laughed awkwardly before turning to Ye Fengdu.

“Thank you, Ye Fengdu. We’ll take our leave!” Bai He and Hei Chao pulled Luo Tian out of Fengdu Palace under the eyes of its people.

“The Grand Master once saw the Six Paths of Reincarnation through special means. This kid saw it on his own!”

“Still, the time was short. I doubt he could have grasped much,” seeing Bai He and Luo Tian leave, the people of Fengdu Palace became a chaotic mess.

Chapter 2515: Failure

“Who knows what he experienced?” Ye Fengdu’s eyes flashed with a divine light. He showed no anger, only an enigmatic smile.

“Truly didn’t expect it. Otherwise I would have thought Bai He and Hei Chao were deceiving me!” Ye Fengdu muttered, leaving the elders and disciples of Fengdu Palace confused.

“Alright, Ye Qiu, prepare. Head to the Gate of Departure and launch the first battle!” Ye Fengdu ignored the bewildered crowd, shifting the topic to Ye Qiu.

“One million disciples, plus the ghosts and soldiers of the Gate of Departure, are enough for you to break into the Immortal Realm!” Ye Fengdu spoke.

“Yes! I obey!” Ye Qiu straightened his posture, a solemn expression in his eyes as he bowed to Ye Fengdu. At the same time, except for the Holy Sons of the Equal and Heaven-Yin Palaces, the other palaces’ Holy Sons were constantly urging their own.

Since the Equal and Yin Spirit Palaces ranked tenth and ninth in the Ten Palace Competition, they would not participate immediately. If any of the other eight palaces encountered trouble, these two would step in.

While the Ten Yama Palaces prepared for battle, Luo Tian and Bai He and Hei Chao finally returned to the Wheel Turning Palace, calming its disciples.

“Grand Master, my share of benefits—give it to me first. I was almost at the middle stage of Immortal King!” As soon as Luo Tian returned to the Wheel Turning Palace, he followed Bai He and Hei Chao constantly demanding things.

“You’re annoying! With the battle about to start, you still haggle with me? If we conquer the Immortal Realm, what do you lack!”

“Also, don’t think I don’t know about the last treasure vault incident. I haven’t finished counting with you yet! Damn it, where did those five percent of resources go!” Bai He and Hei Chao’s angry curses answered Luo Tian, then kicked him out of the ninety-eighth level Wheel Turning Palace.

“Sigh…”

“I suppose it’s not about being stingy!” Luo Tian sighed longingly, returning to his residence. Though Bai He and Hei Chao said they wouldn’t give him anything, they still symbolically gave Luo Tian a storage bag.

Luo Tian estimated the contents. The herbs and elixirs inside would allow him to reach the middle stage of Immortal King, though the rate at which he could refine them was much slower than in Fengdu Palace’s Avici Hell.

“Take it slow,” Luo Tian took out a medicinal herb, chewed it with crunching sounds, and walked toward the Ghost Feeding Pavilion. After all, he needed to meet Fu Xingxuan before the battle.

Under the respectful gazes of the Wheel Turning Palace disciples, Luo Tian arrived at the Ghost Feeding Pavilion. He greeted the ghosts and reached the last level of the Wheel Turning Palace.

However, on the grey bridge, it was empty. No sign of Fu Xingxuan. Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly.

“Little Ming!” Luo Tian called out to the Yellow River, and waves surged. A massive tortoise emerged from the Yellow River—Ming Gui.

“Roar…” Ming Gui opened its mouth, spitting out a jade slip before Luo Tian. Luo Tian furrowed his brows.

“Peng…” Luo Tian crushed the jade slip, and an image appeared in his vision. The exquisite beauty was only for Luo Tian to possess—Fu Xingxuan.

“I am in seclusion beneath the Yellow River. Nothing major, don’t wake me!”

“Remember, those people I told you about—don’t harm them. If you harm one, you’ll regret it for life!” The ghostly figure spoke to Luo Tian.

“Okay,” Luo Tian didn’t think much, sighed longingly. A sense of unease stirred in his heart but he had no suspicions. After all, Fu Xingxuan wouldn’t leave here.

Luo Tian stood on the grey bridge, his face complex. He waved his hand, and a ghostly soul appeared in his palm.

“Tian,” the grey soul smiled, gazing at Luo Tian with gentle eyes.

“Father, are you really leaving?” Luo Tian’s face bore sorrow. In his memory, Luo Shui was his father.

“Yes, I can’t watch you reach the peak.”

“But the great enmity has been avenged. You are the only one I worry about, but now you’ve grown, so there’s nothing to fear,” Luo Shui smiled, gazing at the rolling Yellow River.

Luo Tian formed hand seals. Waves of soul power flew from his hands, solidifying Luo Shui’s soul. He waved his hand, releasing Luo Shui’s soul and embedding it into a flourishing Nirvana Flower. He bowed before the flower, sorrowful.

“Father, may you travel well!” Luo Tian’s eyes welled with tears as he shouted to the Nirvana Flower.

“Little Ming, protect my father!” Luo Tian patted Ming Gui’s head and soared into the air. He returned to his residence, calming his emotions before sighing deeply.

“This girl suddenly went into seclusion. She should know I’m going to battle!” Luo Tian returned to his residence, a slight confusion in his heart.

Luo Tian sat cross-legged, refining the resources Bai He and Hei Chao had given him. He planned to use these days to try breaking through to the middle stage of Immortal King.

As Luo Tian entered seclusion, the disciples of the Wheel Turning Palace became busy. Some were assigned by Bai He and Hei Chao to other palaces for cultivation, a reward for Luo Tian healing those Holy Sons. Meanwhile, many disciples quickly gathered, unaware of their purpose due to secrecy.

Time passed slowly. Five days slipped by. On the peak of the Wheel Turning Palace’s main mountain, fifty thousand disciples stood there, making the summit unusually crowded. Eighty thousand Heaven-Realm and twenty thousand True-Realm disciples—each radiated a formidable aura. Though not the most elite of the Wheel Turning Palace, they were top-tier among their peers.

“Everyone, your time to make a name has come. Today we depart for the Gate of Departure!” Jueying Celestial Lord stood on a high platform, addressing the hundred thousand disciples. Time was nearly up; even if they sent messages here, it would take time to reach the Gate of Departure. No need to worry about leaks.

“Hua…” The hundred thousand disciples instantly erupted in chaos, faces filled with excitement. These people had never entered the Immortal Realm before.

“Correct! We must attack the Immortal Realm. Our hellish conditions are poor—now it’s time to change its masters! You will be the vanguard of our Wheel Turning Palace. Within half a year, you must break into ten thousand miles of the Immortal Realm!” Jueying Celestial Lord shouted.

“Yes!” The hundred thousand disciples answered in unison, their battle spirit soaring. Their voices echoed through the Wheel Turning Palace.

“What’s going on!” The entire area of the Wheel Turning Palace, all cities within millions of miles trembled. No one knew why the Wheel Turning Palace had suddenly become so active.

“This time, you will be led by our Wheel Turning Palace’s Holy Sons. Gather the Gate of Departure army and the Beast Ghost King’s forces, then strike into the Immortal Realm!”

“Meanwhile, Fengdu Palace and Shura Palace will also attack the Immortal Realm. Don’t disgrace us—those who are last to break into ten thousand miles will be mocked!” Jueying Celestial Lord’s voice was loud, filled with encouragement. The disciples of the Wheel Turning Palace were invigorated.

“Yes!” Another shout, the hundred thousand disciples’ faces showed excitement. They had long heard that the Immortal Realm was rich, far better than hell’s environment.

“Wu…” As their voices had just finished, waves of energy rose behind Jueying Celestial Lord. A ghostly vortex appeared and rushed into the Wheel Turning Palace.

“Who? Who broke through now? The movement seems like an Immortal King!” Four Celestial Lords showed shock, gazing at the Wheel Turning Palace.

“Only Luo Tian is missing. Did he break through to the middle stage of Immortal King?” One Celestial Lord spoke, his voice filled with disbelief.

In the Wheel Turning Palace’s residence of Luo Tian:

“Open!” Sweat poured from Luo Tian’s face. His dantian roared continuously. In five days, he had refined half of the resources Bai He and Hei Chao gave him. Luo Tian felt ready, attempting to break through to the middle stage of Immortal King.

Ghostly energy continuously rushed into Luo Tian’s body, refining his dantian. A series of ghostly dragon-like energy coils swept through him.

As it was a clone, this body wasn’t a demon cultivator but a genuine ghost cultivator.

Thousands of souls howled, the grey domain expanded slowly outward.

Four thousand one hundred feet… four thousand two hundred feet… until four thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine feet, the domain suddenly stopped. Luo Tian spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Failed!” Luo Tian muttered, the ghostly vortex on his head dissipating. His face was pale.

“What’s happening? Why wouldn’t it let me break through?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He had felt a fifty percent chance of breaking into the middle stage of Immortal King, but at the critical moment, something seemed to block him.

“Your soul is incomplete!” Bai He and Hei Chao appeared beside Luo Tian, sighing softly.

“Soul incomplete? Is it because of my amnesia?” Luo Tian spoke softly. He had thought restoring his memory wouldn’t affect him much.

“Correct. Unfortunately, there are no Immortal Realm alchemists in our hell!” Bai He and Hei Chao spoke, their voices filled with regret.

“First go to the Gate of Departure. If we can catch an alchemist, keep them!” Bai He and Hei Chao were also helpless, worried Luo Tian would remain stuck at the initial stage of Immortal King.

“Hmph!” Luo Tian nodded, then soared into the air. He saw the people of the Wheel Turning Palace waiting for him outside.

“Failed!” Seeing Luo Tian still radiating the initial stage of Immortal King, Jueying Celestial Lord and others sighed. If Luo Tian had reached the middle stage of Immortal King, it would have greatly boosted the Wheel Turning Palace’s morale.

“Is this not a bad omen?” The hundred thousand disciples shifted from excitement to slight discouragement.

“Even if I didn’t break through the middle stage of Immortal King, I’ve slain an Immortal King before!” Luo Tian spoke confidently.

Chapter 2516: Who’s不服, step forward!

“Hua…” Luo Tian’s words instantly raised the disciples’ battle spirit.

“Yes! Holy Son, you’ve slain the Heaven-Devil King. You already possess the strength of an Immortal King middle stage!” Some silent disciples, hearing his confident words, suddenly shouted.

Jueying Celestial Lord and others showed admiration upon hearing Luo Tian’s words. They hadn’t expected such a single sentence to boost morale again.

“Depart!” Luo Tian spoke, soared into the air. His body stood proudly in the sky. Five half-Immortal Kings followed him, landing on the front of the massive warship already prepared.

“I have nothing to say. No matter when, I, Luo Tian, will always stand with you!” Luo Tian shouted loudly, causing the Wheel Turning Palace disciples to shout in unison. No matter what identity Luo Tian had before, he was now their Holy Son, bringing many honors to the Wheel Turning Palace.

“Depart!” Luo Tian spoke, soared into the air. His body stood proudly in the sky. Five half-Immortal Kings followed him, landing on the front of the massive warship already prepared. One hundred thousand Wheel Turning Palace disciples soared into the air, landing on the massive warship, filling it completely.

“Go!” Luo Tian spoke. A large banner fluttered up, the words “Wheel Turning Palace” floating above it. The pole radiated waves, enveloping the entire warship. The massive ship soared into the sky.

The massive ship instantly flew out of the Wheel Turning Palace, heading toward the Gate of Departure. The banner swept through, flapping loudly. As the ship took off, various hellish forces watching over the Wheel Turning Palace trembled, gazing at the ship carrying a hundred thousand souls. They didn’t know why the Wheel Turning Palace had mobilized so heavily.

“Yama Ten Palaces are attacking the Immortal Realm!” The city lords received messages, all shocked.

At the same time, other palaces also departed. Massive warships flew toward the eight ghost gates of hell. That day, the entire hell trembled. Yama Ten Palaces and Eight Heavenly Kings attacked the Immortal Realm—no one expected the hell’s rulers to suddenly attack it.

“Immortal Realm, if successful, we can also enter!” The people of hell were invigorated.

“Every hell cultivator must attack the Immortal Realm. All Yama Ten Palaces and Eight Heavenly Kings’ forces must participate!” That day, all city lords of hell’s various factions received a joint message from the Yama Ten Palaces and Eight Heavenly Kings.

The entire hell moved, rushing toward the eight major ghost gates. The Yama Ten Palaces were the rulers of hell, so who dared disobey? Additionally, hellish ghost cultivators were cruel and warlike, so most forces rushed to the Yama Palaces and Eight Major Gates for orders.

Black warships soared through the sky, passing over cities. Each city welcomed them with shouts.

Half a month passed quickly. Black warships finally reached the Gate of Departure’s area. The Wheel Turning Palace disciples on board felt a massive battle spirit and the scent of blood.

Black earth stretched endlessly, obscured by black ghost mist. A black wall appeared in their view.

On the black wall stood figures, led by Wu Mian. Behind him stood legion leaders and iron-blooded generals of the Gate of Departure. Many generals bore cold expressions, for they knew their commander was their former enemy—Luo Tian, who had killed many of their soldiers.

“Past matters are over. He is now our Holy Son, our leader!” Wu Mian’s voice echoed in their ears.

“隆隆…” A massive warship appeared outside the wall. Luo Tian stood at its front, gazing at the generals with cold expressions. He knew why—though he had amnesia, he had heard of it.

“Respect the Holy Son!” Wu Mian’s voice rang out, bowing to Luo Tian. In terms of status, Luo Tian was higher than him.

Moreover, the Grand Masters of Bai He and Hei Chao had ordered Luo Tian’s arrival as the highest commander of the Gate of Departure.

“La la…” Wu Mian’s people knelt on one knee, but some still stood straight, gazing at Luo Tian with cold eyes. Among them were even two legion leaders.

“Do you want to rebel?” Wu Mian’s cold voice echoed, causing those people to flush red. Those who were angry but unwilling to bow finally did so.

“General Wu Mian, I hope you’ll look after me!” Luo Tian smiled as if he hadn’t seen them before, addressing Wu Mian.

“Please allow the Holy Son to rest inside!” Wu Mian bowed, guiding Luo Tian into the city.

Before Luo Tian could enter, a thunderous sound rose again in the sky. A warship flew from the horizon.

“Beast Flag! It’s the Beast Ghost King City!” People instantly recognized it. After all, the Beast Ghost King City was much closer to the Gate of Departure.

Wang Gang stood proudly at the front of the ship, seeing Luo Tian and Wu Mian on the wall. He bowed to them.

“Beast Ghost King City has arrived at the Gate of Departure!” Wang Gang shouted. Behind him, the ship was also filled with people—fifty thousand in total.

“Wang Brother, I hope you are well!” Luo Tian bowed to Wang Gang as he landed on the wall.

“Haha, your strength has improved again!” Wang Gang laughed, then greeted Wu Mian. The three entered the city.

The one hundred and fifty thousand from the Wheel Turning Palace and Beast Ghost King City naturally had arrangements. Luo Tian and Wang Gang followed Wu Mian into a grand hall. Wu Mian seated Luo Tian in the center, while he and Wang Gang sat on either side. Others were half-Immortal Kings—these people were high enough to enter.

“Holy Son, the Gate of Departure currently has two million Heaven-Realm and twenty-five thousand True-Realm disciples. As for the Heaven-Realm ghosts, I won’t mention them. There are about fifty thousand that can match True-Realm strength,” Wu Mian reported to Luo Tian immediately.

“Good. General Wu Mian, you are more familiar with this place. Though I am the highest commander, I’ll leave the command to you,” Luo Tian nodded. After all, Wu Mian had guarded this place for countless years and surely knew more about the Gate of Departure than him.

“I entrust my life and Wang Gang’s to General Wu Mian!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing Wu Mian.

“Subordinates obey!” Wu Mian quickly stood up. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to delegate so much power.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the generals who had previously guarded the Gate of Departure showed less coldness in their eyes.

“Also, everyone, I know you have doubts about me. In the future, we’ll work together. In hell, strength is supreme. If anyone among you不服 and wants revenge, feel free to come to me now. I’ll accept it all!”

“Of course, here you can take revenge. If anyone tries to sabotage on the battlefield or acts out of spite, causing losses for our Wheel Turning Palace, I won’t be so lenient!” Luo Tian addressed the half-Immortal Kings.

“I不服! You led the Immortal Realm people and killed so many of my men!” A burly man stood up immediately, gazing at Luo Tian with hatred.

“However, you are at the initial stage of Immortal King and a Holy Son. I know I’m not your match, but I still不服!” The man stood straight, his face and body marked with scars.

“Zhou Yuan, get down!” Seeing the man stand up, Wu Mian instantly became angry and shouted.

“Holy Son, don’t take it personally. He’s a brute. We’ll take him out!” Two legion leaders stood up, smiling and pulling Zhou Yuan to leave.

“Leave what? Defying superiors is a capital crime. Take him out and behead him!” Wu Mian roared, his voice cold. He knew Zhou Yuan’s character but this act clearly angered Luo Tian. Wu Mian said this to test Luo Tian’s attitude—whether he would kill Zhou Yuan, and if so, he’d try to save him.

“Enough. As a Holy Son, if I can’t speak, then I’m not worthy of being one!” Luo Tian smiled lightly, gazing at Zhou Yuan.

“I’ll fight you on equal terms. If I can kill me, I’ll repay your brothers’ lives. If I can’t, then you’ll just be a legion leader from now on!” Luo Tian spoke softly, sending waves of energy onto his body, lowering his aura.

“This…” Seeing Luo Tian’s actions, Zhou Yuan hesitated. Other legion leaders also showed surprise.

“Of course, you can all come at once!” Luo Tian gazed at the other legion leaders. He knew these people, except Du Changming, had resentment toward him.

Du Changming now wore a wistful expression, watching Luo Tian’s growth. He felt moved—unbelievable how fast Luo Tian had grown. When he first met Luo Tian, he was at True-Realm. In just a few years, he had reached the initial stage of Immortal King—similar to himself. Though Du Changming had already become a half-Immortal King, his promotion wasn’t surprising.

“Luo Shui has a good son!” Du Changming thought to himself, feeling happy for Luo Shui.

“Arrogant!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the other legion leaders’ faces turned red. They felt Luo Tian was mocking them.

“Good!” Zhou Yuan shouted, nodding in agreement. He clearly had no intention of backing down.

“Prepare!” Luo Tian addressed them, but the legion leaders looked at Wu Mian instead.

“Go ahead!” Wu Mian sighed in frustration. He knew Luo Tian was trying to establish authority. He understood Luo Tian’s strength.

The legion leaders left the hall, preparing for battle. Only Luo Tian and others remained in the hall to discuss military matters.

Chapter 2517: Battle Begins

Time passed slowly, and Luo Tian finally understood the situation at the Gate of Departure.

“Good. Now we just need to issue the attack order. Holy Son, Tian Gui Wang, do you have any comments?” Wu Mian addressed Luo Tian and Wang Gang.

“No. Good!” Luo Tian and Wang Gang nodded. There was nothing to discuss; their forces at the Gate of Departure could take over Buxian City without issue. The real discussion was about what to do after taking Buxian City, as the Immortal Realm would surely retaliate. That was when it would be most critical.

“General, we are ready!” A legion leader entered immediately after their discussion, addressing Wu Mian and others.

A massive platform stood in the center of the camp. A group of Gate of Departure soldiers gathered around it.

“Is the Holy Son going to suppress his strength to fight against Zhou’s legion leader?” People murmured, gazing at the burly man standing on the platform with reverence.

The crowd dispersed. Luo Tian and Wu Mian walked out, earning respect from the people—though this respect was only for Wu Mian.

“Indeed it’s him. He was ranked eighth on our kill list!” Many soldiers showed anger, but they dared not speak out.

“Now he’s become our Wheel Turning Palace Holy Son. Alas…” Many sighed, knowing their revenge was impossible.

Luo Tian soared onto the platform, smiling at Zhou Yuan’s red face. “Begin! Will you fight alone?”

“Enough!” Zhou Yuan roared, stepping forward and transforming into a tiger-like figure, rushing toward Luo Tian.

A large fist rose, carrying an impressive sound, striking Luo Tian.

“Zhou Yuan’s legion leader once shattered a True-Realm Buxian City commander!” People cheered, knowing Zhou Yuan’s strength.

“Peng…” But as people cheered, a deep sound echoed from the platform.

Luo Tian caught Zhou Yuan’s fist with one hand, smiling and standing still. His robes fluttered as he gazed at Zhou Yuan.

“Huh?” Zhou Yuan’s face changed. He felt like he had hit an iron plate and couldn’t pull his fist out.

“Open!” Zhou Yuan’s other hand struck Luo Tian, but still couldn’t move him at all.

“Are you defeated?” Luo Tian smiled lightly, flipping his hands and lifting Zhou Yuan before throwing him far away.

“Peng…” Zhou Yuan’s body crashed onto the platform, stones flying. People trembled.

“He has no fighting ability at all!” Everyone gasped, gazing at Luo Tian. Though he had suppressed his strength, Zhou Yuan was a legion leader of the Gate of Departure and had skills. Yet in Luo Tian’s presence, he had no ability to fight back.

“You can all come at once!” Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at the other legion leaders.

“Go!” Luo Tian’s words caused three more to rush onto the platform, attacking him.

Luo Tian remained calm, moving like a dragon. He struck three times with his fists, and three deep sounds followed. Again, three figures fell to the ground in a heap, their faces filled with shock as they gazed at Luo Tian. At that moment, he seemed like a mountain to them.

“I haven’t used my full strength yet. Why did you fall so quickly?” Luo Tian smiled, but his face suddenly changed from a smile to icy coldness. Zhou Yuan and the four legion leaders, as well as those watching from below, shivered.

“This time is over. If there’s a next time, I won’t be so lenient!”

“Worthless! You are worthless in my eyes. What about your experience? In the face of absolute strength, you’re nothing!” Luo Tian spoke, his voice filled with contempt.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the legion leaders’ faces turned red instantly. They glared at Luo Tian with madness.

“My words still hold: anyone, no matter how many, can challenge me at equal level anytime!” Luo Tian spoke coldly, gazing at the legion leaders and the soldiers and officers watching.

Luo Tian’s blatant humiliation completely ignited the soldiers’ and officers’ fighting spirit. Everyone felt a fire burning within them.

“Is it too harsh?” Wu Mian transmitted to Luo Tian, knowing his intention.

“With the battle approaching, the harsher the better. This way, they might survive in this anger during the war.”

“Reducing casualties—what’s wrong with being the villain!” Luo Tian replied, his eyes challenging. As he jumped off the platform, one by one of the soldiers and officers glared at Luo Tian. If looks could kill, they would have reduced him to ashes.

“Don’t look! What good are your eyes if they pop out? If I were you, I’d focus on cultivation now. Then, when you fight me again to wash away your disgrace!” Luo Tian walked through the crowd toward the residence Wu Mian had arranged for him.

“Roar…” One by one of the soldiers and officers roared, eyes filled with anger. They had experienced many wars here; some had remarkable battle records, but today they were completely crushed by Luo Tian.

“Don’t shout! Isn’t it enough to be embarrassed? Four people, equal level battle—yet you were beaten in four punches!” Wu Mian sneered, gazing at Zhou Yuan.

“This time is over. If there’s a next time, I’ll execute without mercy!” Wu Mian’s voice echoed in their ears. They heard Wu Mian’s anger, clearly his actions had embarrassed them.

Everyone lowered their heads in shame but suppressed the fire within. It was as if it accumulated, and when it erupted, it would be terrifying.

Wu Mian didn’t separate the Wheel Turning Palace and Beast Ghost King City forces. In his view, it was easier to manage them this way, as they needed time to integrate.

That night in the Gate of Departure’s camp, many chose to cultivate or find friends for combat.

Meanwhile, Bai He and Hei Chao sat in the Wheel Turning Palace, their faces filled with anticipation.

“Time should have arrived!” Bai He and Hei Chao spoke, extending their hands. A black token appeared in their hands.

In an instant, their spiritual awareness entered a strange space, forming the images of Bai He and Hei Chao. This space already had nine people standing there—other Yama Ten Palaces’ Grand Masters.

“How come you’re late? We’ve been waiting for ages!” Tianyu Old Ghost showed impatience.

“Sorry, something delayed me. Have your people arrived?” Bai He and Hei Chao smiled.

This space could only be entered by the ten of them. It was where they had prepared for this attack on the Immortal Realm.

Hell is vast, and the eight ghost gates are too far. They could command the entire battlefield here, supporting each other to prevent accidents and respond flexibly.

“Already arrived. We’ve been waiting for you!” Other Grand Masters spoke, their voices filled with excitement.

“Then can we… start the battle?” Bai He and Hei Chao spoke, their voices also filled with anticipation.

“Yes. Tomorrow morning, the eight ghost gates will attack the Immortal Realm!” They all spoke at once.

A day passed silently. The Gate of Departure still had no sunlight, but they knew the time.

Luo Tian wore black robes and slowly stood up. He wanted to consult Wu Mian about what to do next.

“Today is the battle!” As Luo Tian just stood up, his waist token emitted waves. Bai He and Hei Chao’s voices echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, causing his body to tremble slightly. His eyes showed seriousness.

This token was specially made. Only five in the Wheel Turning Palace had it, with one function: to transmit over long distances—ten times that of a regular token.

Luo Tian’s body flickered and vanished from the spot, appearing in the previous meeting hall. Wu Mian also appeared, this time sitting at the head.

“Commanders of all legions and thousand-man leaders, come to the meeting hall!” Wu Mian’s voice echoed throughout the Gate of Departure.

“Something big is about to happen!” Wu Mian’s voice echoed, causing the camp’s people to tremble slightly. Since Luo Tian and Wang Gang led a hundred and fifty thousand people here, the Gate of Departure’s soldiers felt something was about to happen.

In an instant, figures rushed into the hall. This time, the hall became crowded.

“Half an hour to assemble the army and attack Buxian City. Seven days, we must break into Buxian City!” Wu Mian spoke, issuing a death order.

“Luo Tian, left flank vanguard. Lead the Wheel Turning Palace disciples to attack from the left wing. Wang Gang, right flank vanguard. Lead the Beast Ghost King City’s forces to attack from the right wing. I, the Grand General, will personally lead the Gate of Departure’s soldiers to attack Buxian City directly!” Wu Mian didn’t waste words, stating the key points.

“Obey!” Commanders and thousand-man leaders stepped out of the hall, beginning to assemble their soldiers.

“Holy Son, if you meet any familiar faces in Buxian City, won’t you be too merciful?” Wu Mian spoke to Luo Tian, causing him to startle slightly.

“Familiar faces in Buxian City?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He truly didn’t remember having any familiar faces in Buxian City.

“No,” Luo Tian nodded. He was now a member of hell, the Wheel Turning Palace’s Holy Son.

“That’s good. But it’s not something you can control!” Wu Mian spoke again, his voice filled with strong confidence. They had always been stronger than Buxian City; they just hadn’t launched a full-scale attack before.

Half an hour passed. Commanders reported their legions had assembled, while the Wheel Turning Palace and Beast Ghost King City disciples were slightly delayed. This showed their overall quality.

Wu Mian, Luo Tian, and Wang Gang walked out of the hall. They gazed at the assembled army.

“March forth! Leave no grass growing!” Wu Mian’s cold voice echoed through the world.

Chapter 2518: Arrival at Buxian City

“Yes!” A thunderous shout echoed. Officers like they had been injected with energy rushed out of the Gate of Departure.

“Roar…” Howls echoed. Countless ghosts surged out of the Gate of Departure, like a flood. Hundreds of thousands and countless ghosts formed a black tide, rushing into the battlefield.

Luo Tian, Wu Mian, and Wang Gang stood at the back of the army. Luo Tian wore a contemplative expression, unsure how many would be buried in the battlefield.

But as Wu Mian said, he couldn’t change it. If he had memories, Luo Tian wouldn’t have chosen to enter the Gate of Departure but would have guarded the Ghost Gate at Yongsheng Mountain. Unfortunately, now Luo Tian, due to his time in hell, had a somewhat cold personality.

The army marched out quickly. It would take about four days to reach Buxian City from the Gate of Departure.
