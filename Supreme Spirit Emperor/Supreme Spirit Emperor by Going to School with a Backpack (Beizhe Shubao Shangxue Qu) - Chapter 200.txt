“Huh…” At three thousand zhang below Tongtian Mountain, Luo Tian and Long Jie appeared before Gu Tianshu, his face pale with a touch of reverence.

“In the end, it worked out. I never thought this page of the Epoch Scripture saved me; otherwise, today would have been quite troublesome!” Luo Tian’s eyes carried a bitter smile alongside a hint of relief.

Luo Tian had devised this plan based on the insights he gained from the fragment of the Epoch Scripture obtained in the Shanhai Pavilion two days prior.

This fragment of the Epoch Scripture eluded comprehension even for Du Hongtao and Wang Jianzhou, but for Luo Tian—the true master of the Epoch Scripture—it posed no great complexity.

Over two days, Luo Tian consumed early-stage Saintly-grade elixirs to recover his strength before delving into the fragment’s mysteries. At last, he succeeded in deciphering it.

Initially, Luo Tian had hoped this fragment might reveal a method to ascend to the Saintly Realm, just like the previous fragment from the Shangshen Continent. However, as he delved deeper, he realized his mistake: this fragment did not record the path to becoming a Saint but instead contained an extraordinary martial technique.

Void Space Traversal! The very art many yearn for—teleportation. With such a life-saving technique, Luo Tian naturally sought to master it, especially given the relentless pursuit by the Divine Clan elder.

Teleportation remains beyond most people’s grasp, even for those at the middle or late stages of Sainthood. The so-called “instant movement” perceived by commoners stems from their inability to detect the speed of true masters. However, within the same realm, such speed would no longer qualify as “instant.”

Long Jie’s face bore an odd expression. He had not expected Luo Tian to possess such a technique. Yet, upon spotting Gu Tianshu seated in the black space, his face paled instantly.

“Ghost!” Long Jie shouted, snapping out of his stupor and fleeing behind Luo Tian, fear etched on his face as he gazed at Gu Tianshu.

“Respectful greeting, Grandfather!” Luo Tian patted Long Jie’s shoulder to calm him, his face marked with reverence as he knelt before Gu Tianshu, offering the formal courtesy of a junior.

“You’ve arrived… those four people outside—should I intervene?” Gu Tianshu’s lifeless eyes slowly opened, his voice weak as he addressed Luo Tian.

“No need for Grandfather’s intervention. Let them fight among themselves first. Once my injuries heal, I’ll deal with them myself.” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed coldly as he gazed into the void.

“A mere early-stage Saint and four minor transcendent beings—hardly worth my life essence!” Gu Tianshu’s eyes darkened upon seeing Luo Tian’s severe wounds.

To Gu Tianshu, Luo Tian was his descendant; the rise of the Gu family depended on him. Now that Luo Tian had been gravely wounded, this world-shaking immortal’s fury was palpable.

“Grandfather need not act. I shall avenge my own grudge. This visit was to recover my injuries and test if I can ascend to the Saintly Realm. My current strength is still insufficient,” Luo Tian said, his face carrying a hint of resignation. He sighed inwardly—when would cultivation ever be enough? There were always stronger enemies, and the path of cultivation knew no end. Even after reaching the Saintly Realm, there were still mid-stage and late-stage realms, and legends of the Epoch Realm. It left Luo Tian speechless.

“Very well. Those four transcendent beings outside should hold out for a while. Try, then. Don’t heal your injuries—once you enter the Saintly Realm, these wounds will be trivial. The only thing to replenish is your essence blood.” Gu Tianshu’s weathered face bore a faint smile as he extended his hand, releasing a droplet of blue blood that flew into Luo Tian’s body.

The blue blood surged into Luo Tian, causing his pale face to tremble. His complexion, once drained of essence blood, instantly regained vitality, his expression filled with disbelief.

Yet Gu Tianshu’s already gaunt face grew even more haggard, his body resembling a withered corpse as he sat motionless.

Vibrant blood energy radiated from Luo Tian, and he bowed deeply to Gu Tianshu, gratitude in his eyes. He knew this was Gu Tianshu’s life essence—his very capital for enduring until now.

Chapter 903: Two Tigers Fighting ()

Beneath Tongtian Mountain, Gu Tianshu’s withered face watched Luo Tian kneeling before him. His aged visage bore a faint smile: “Enough, don’t be so formal. A single drop of essence is nothing to me—no harm done!”

“Yes,” Luo Tian replied, knowing this was not the time for pretense. He knelt on the ground below, his face marked with solemnity.

As Luo Tian sat in meditation, Gu Tianshu’s withered fingers waved again, and a cascade of talismanic characters flooded into Luo Tian’s mind—those he had previously deciphered on the mountain wall.

These characters were originally inscribed by Gu Tianshu for those with destiny, and now they would greatly aid Luo Tian’s ascent to the early-stage Saintly Realm.

“Refining essence into qi… refining qi into spirit… refining spirit into void… refining void into saint… Continuation of the Heart…” The incantations etched themselves in Luo Tian’s mind, granting him a sudden epiphany. His wounded body gradually calmed, entering meditation.

“Grandpa… do you think my brother can enter the Saintly Realm?” Long Jie, idle and fearful, asked Gu Tianshu.

“Haha, your dragon lineage is so rich—seems you’re a prodigy too! I’ve seen the dragons before, even the Dragon Emperor of the Beast Domain. I feel none possess such rich lineage as you—rare indeed!” Gu Tianshu’s gaze swept over Long Jie, admiration in his eyes.

Hearing this, Long Jie trembled inwardly, wondering how long the old man had lived to have seen the Dragon Emperor.

“Haha, you call Luo Tian ‘brother’—your bond must be very close!” Gu Tianshu smiled, noticing the Nirvana Dragon Seal on Luo Tian’s arm and nodding in approval.

“Indeed, I have a bit of dragon lineage here—perhaps it will aid you!” Gu Tianshu’s face softened, and he pressed his finger, sending a streak of blue talismanic characters into Long Jie’s mind.

“This… is the inheritance of a dragon saint?” Long Jie felt fragments in his mind, his face filled with astonishment. He hadn’t expected Gu Tianshu to possess such a treasure.

“An accidental acquisition back then—useless for me, but it should serve you well. It’s also fulfilling the old promise to the Dragon Clan!” Gu Tianshu’s voice echoed before he closed his eyes again, unwilling to speak further.

“Thank you, Grandfather!” Long Jie knelt before Gu Tianshu without hesitation. After all, he and Luo Tian were closer than brothers; to him, Gu Tianshu was the Grandfather, and he offered the same formal courtesy as Luo Tian.

“Meditate! I hope both of you ascend simultaneously!” Gu Tianshu’s voice echoed, and the underground space fell silent again. The three sat in meditation, but Luo Tian and Long Jie’s bodies radiated waves of energy.

…

Meanwhile, outside the Tongtian Continent, the Divine Clan elder and Wen Chongxiu, Han Guangxian, and two others clashed fiercely.

“This old man—why is he so formidable!” The four men cursed inwardly. Their opponent was an insufferable foe, and even their combined strength failed to subdue him, instead being dominated. Worse still, they sensed his injuries were severe. This revelation left them stunned.

While the four marveled at their opponent’s strength, the Divine Clan elder felt humiliation. He had once easily crushed transcendent beings in his prime, yet now he was held at bay by a single old man. The elder’s humiliation was palpable.

The Divine Clan elder had previously been wounded by Luo Tian and pursued him for two days. Though his injuries had partially healed, he was far from his prime. Now, reengaging battle, the wounds inflicted by Luo Tian’s demon sword worsened again.

“Damn it! You four little brats are really annoying! Die!” The Divine Clan elder’s face bore a mad killing intent, growing weary of their entanglement and ready to deliver a fatal blow.

“Divine Domain, All Under Heaven!” The elder roared, golden light surging again as he entered the same state he had used against Luo Tian. Clearly, attaining that realm was no simple feat.

“Divine Being!” The four men’s faces paled as they gazed at the elder, who now seemed like a god. A sense of submission stirred within them, slowing their movements.

“Truly transcendent beings dare to act recklessly before me? You four are the boldest in history!” The elder’s face glowed with divine light, and his spiritual vessel was also summoned. He held it in hand, eyes cold with killing intent.

“Saint… Saintly Realm!” The elder now radiated divine light, his power seemingly returned to its peak. This left the four men unable to muster resistance.

“Is it really a Saintly Realm? My heavens, we’ve been fighting a Saint!” The four men were stunned. They had assumed the elder was merely a half-step saint like Luo Tian, but now they realized he was an early-stage saint of the same caliber as the three sects’ masters.

“Die!” The elder coldly snorted, his voice echoing as golden rivers of stars surged toward the four men.

“Pardon us, Master!” The four shouted in unison, fear etched on their faces. The elder’s power was terrifying beyond comprehension, far exceeding their capacity to withstand.

“Too late!” The elder’s face bore coldness, his eyes filled with endless killing intent. He would not let them escape.

Golden rivers of stars surged down, as if to crush and melt the four men.

Though they begged for mercy, their hands moved swiftly—two saintly weapons materialized above them. The masters were Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian.

“Self-destruct!” They spoke in unison, their hearts aching. Though they were transcendent beings with saintly weapons from their sects’ generations, facing the elder’s attack left them no choice.

Explosions erupted as the two saintly weapons self-destructed, colliding with the golden rivers from the Divine Clan elder’s spiritual vessel. The clash shook Tongtian Continent, leaving Song Yongkang and Wang Xuanyang trembling in fear.

“This is terrifying! Why do I feel fear?” Song Yongkang shivered, having just entered the transcendent realm. He had never fought at this level before; now he realized how far he lagged behind these masters.

Explosions echoed as four figures plummeted from the sky. Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian coughed blood, their bodies shattered.

Lu Xingping and Mu Yulong fared even worse, their bodies on the brink of destruction. A single touch would reduce them to dust.

The Divine Clan elder’s face bore coldness as he instantly appeared before the unconscious Lu Xingping and Mu Yulong, his foot crushing them into blood mist. Their souls were also obliterated beneath his heel.

“Hmph, still injured—otherwise I wouldn’t have needed to use Divine Domain and saintly weapons!” The elder snorted, golden light surging as he rushed toward Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian.

“Master, please have mercy! We’ll be your dogs from now on—obey you completely!” Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian, terrified beyond reason, begged as the elder approached. They had no choice but to plead for mercy now.

“Hmph?” The Divine Clan elder paused mid-step upon hearing their words, his face showing confusion.

As an immortal who had lived countless years, he discerned the meaning in their words. They were begging for mercy—but why would they say they’d be his dogs? Clearly, they still intended to aid Luo Tian. No one with sense would beg like this.

“What did you say? Begging for mercy and still wanting to help that little beast?” The elder coldly snorted, grabbing the two by the neck and pulling them close.

“Master, weren’t you here to fight us with Luo Tian’s help? We tried to attack Tongtian Sect, but you returned—obviously preventing us!” Wen Chongxiu’s face bore desperation as he explained.

“Boom…” Upon hearing Wen Chongxiu’s words, the Divine Clan elder’s face turned crimson. His entire body trembled.

“Good, good—didn’t expect you to use this trick!” The elder spoke aloud, his body radiating a wild aura.

Even if the Divine Clan elder was foolish, he now understood Luo Tian had pitted his two enemies against each other, letting them fight while he reaped the benefits.

“Cunning plan! Clever plan!” The elder tossed Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian aside, his eyes filled with a faint smile as he gazed at them.

“Do you know who I am?” The elder spoke softly, pressing two pills into their mouths to restore their nearly shattered bodies.

“Am I not your enemy? I came to kill him—because you four fools blocked me, he escaped!” The elder’s face bore fury, his voice a storm that shook Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian’s hearts.

“What?” The two men stared wide-eyed, their jaws trembling as they gazed at the Divine Clan elder.

Chapter 904: Guilt ()

Outside Tongtian Continent’s stars, the Divine Clan elder and Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian stared at each other. Their initial shock gradually turned to embarrassment, then anger.

“Hmph!” The Divine Clan elder’s face bore coldness as he gazed at Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian without striking. He waited for their response.

“Master, our mistake was unwise—we fell into the little beast’s trap. We’ve offended you; please grant us a chance to atone!” Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian knelt before the elder, their faces marked with anger. Facing a saintly being, they had offended him deeply and now could only kneel to beg for forgiveness.

“Useless. Do you know who I am? The Divine Clan of the Demon Realm—shouldn’t you have heard of us? No one has ever treated me so disrespectfully, not even the Beasts Domain. You two minor transcendent beings dared to attack me while I was wounded—this would have meant annihilation in the past!” The elder’s voice roared, his gaze sweeping over them.

“However, since you seem sincere, submit to the Divine Clan. This matter is settled!” The elder’s body glowed with golden light, his face bearing a condescending air as he addressed Wen Chongxiu.

Seeing the elder’s expression, Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian felt some resentment but had no choice. They could not defy a saintly being, especially one from the second-ranked domain in the Nine Realms.

As for their submission to the Divine Clan, how the three sects would react was beyond their control. Naturally, the Divine Clan’s elders would handle it with the three sects—after all, openly subduing a major sect from another domain was clearly overstepping.

“Enough. Follow me into Tongtian Continent—I’ll see if this little beast can hide after I’ve cleansed it! Remember, my name is Sun Shengjie—senior of the Divine Clan!” The elder revealed his identity, his face bearing arrogance as he flashed toward Tongtian Continent.

Sun Shengjie’s words stirred Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian. They hadn’t expected a saintly elder to be merely a senior in the Divine Clan, not even a grand elder. After all, the three sects’ elders were only at the half-step saintly level. This revealed how much stronger the Demon Realm was than the Fire Domain.

Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian exchanged glances, gazing at Sun Shengjie’s golden light as he flew toward Tongtian Continent. Through the void, they saw Song Yongkang standing there with a shocked expression, their faces filled with murderous intent.

Song Yongkang was a transcendent being; sensing the three outside, his face paled. The elder’s previous one-hit kill of two transcendent beings had left a shadow in his heart, making him realize Tongtian Sect could not match them now. A bitter smile crossed his face.

Sun Shengjie’s face bore cold killing intent as he arrived above Tongtian Sect, gazing at the massive mountain of Tongtian Sect. His eyes narrowed upon seeing the eight characters carved into the mountain—those inscribed by Fire Domain’s former master, Gu Tianshu.

As a saintly being, he could sense the Daoic essence of those eight characters, his eyes filled with admiration: “This is the calligraphy Gu Tianshu carved? Indeed extraordinary. Even after so many years, its aura still makes me wary!”

“Master, after killing these people, let us spend some time meditating beneath this wall,” Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian said respectfully, their eyes burning with desire as they gazed at the characters Gu Tianshu had carved. This was their first time so close to them.

“This is indeed a great treasure. If we master it, we might reach the half-step saintly realm! A tremendous opportunity!” Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian’s hearts surged with excitement, waiting for the elder’s reply.

“It’s acceptable. This wall is indeed of great use to transcendent beings. Even I, if I fully comprehend it, would gain much. I wonder what Gu Tianshu’s strength would be if he hadn’t died—how does it compare to the Divine Clan’s old god?” Sun Shengjie’s face bore admiration as he gazed at Tongtian Mountain.

“Enough. Now, we must slaughter all of Luo Tian’s subordinates! Otherwise, I cannot quell my resentment!” Sun Shengjie coldly spoke, gazing at Song Yongkang and Wang Xuanyang standing before him.

“Done!” The entire Tongtian Sect’s disciples watched the three above, despair in their hearts. They had never imagined that Tongtian Sect, which hadn’t been destroyed by Luo Tian, would now face annihilation.

Sun Shengjie had no intention of lingering further; these people were but ants to him. Song Yongkang was somewhat worthy, but not in his eyes.

Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian’s faces bore grimaces as they followed the elder, charging toward Tongtian Sect disciples with murderous intent.

“Tongtian Array!” Song Yongkang, unwilling to give up, shouted at his disciples behind him.

But the disciples did not move; fear filled their faces as they gazed at Sun Shengjie, some even kneeling before him.

“Die!” The elder’s golden hand凝聚ed and struck toward the Tongtian Sect disciples, his face filled with contempt.

At the same time, Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian’s grim smiles emerged as they unleashed powerful martial arts, merging with the elder’s attack into a three-colored storm that swept toward Tongtian Mountain. It seemed like divine wrath, unstoppable.

Feeling the three’s attack, Tongtian Sect disciples’ faces turned desperate—this single strike would leave no survivors.

“Cough… cough…” But just as the three’s furious attack was about to descend on Tongtian Mountain, a light cough echoed in their minds, as if three heavy hammers had struck their hearts, causing them to tremble.

The entire Tongtian Mountain glowed with light; the eight characters on its surface radiated brilliant golden light, exuding a fierce aura. They slowly flew from the mountain, pressing down on the three’s combined attack with overwhelming power.

Golden light surged as the three men, in shock, saw their furious attack shattered by a single golden character.

The eight characters did not stop; they continued to radiate an aura capable of subduing heaven and earth, pressing down on Sun Shengjie and the others.

“Crack…” A crisp sound echoed as the three’s bodies began to crack under the characters’ terrifying pressure, even the Divine Clan elder was not spared.

“What is this? Did Gu Tianshu truly survive?” The Divine Clan elder’s mind was in turmoil, his face filled with fear as he gazed at the eight golden characters that seemed to subdue heaven itself.

The Tongtian Sect disciples were also stunned, never expecting the eight characters on their mountain to possess such power.

But just as the characters were about to subdue the three, the entire Tongtian Continent’s sky darkened. Countless gray vapors churned, as if plunging the continent into chaos.

Within the swirling gray vapors, a golden “guilt” character slowly formed, like the sun, radiating overwhelming power. It surged through the sky toward Tongtian Mountain’s surface.

“Alas…” A long sigh echoed in the heavens, and beneath Tongtian Mountain, Gu Tianshu’s face bore deep resentment as he gazed at the sky’s terrifying “guilt” character.

“Still not enough… Well, leave it to this little beast!” Gu Tianshu’s face bore a bitter smile as he waved his hand. The eight characters that had nearly killed Sun Shengjie and the others retreated, returning to Tongtian Mountain’s surface in silence.

“Boom…” The golden “guilt” character, however, seemed unaffected, crashing into the golden mountain wall as if subduing the eight characters.

“End… too terrifying! No one could resist it! It seems the rumors are true—Gu Tianshu offended Heaven, and even his calligraphy is now subdued by Heaven!” Sun Shengjie’s face bore trembling fear as he gazed at the golden “guilt” character on the mountain wall, reverence in his heart. Whether good or evil, one must respect strength.

“Yet with Heaven’s震慑, this Tongtian Mountain is now mine! With the “guilt” character inscribed by Heaven, I can meditate on Heaven’s will, giving me greater confidence in reaching the peak of the Saintly Realm!” Sun Shengjie’s face bore greed as he gazed at the “guilt” character inscribed by Heaven on the mountain wall.

“Unfortunately, your wish will be unfulfilled!” As Sun Shengjie muttered to himself, Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed from the heavens, causing everyone’s faces to tremble—especially Tongtian Sect disciples, whose despair slowly turned into hope.

“Luo Tian, I never thought you would finally emerge. I’ll see how you turn the tide!” Sun Shengjie’s face bore a faint smile; he did not believe Luo Tian could recover so quickly.

“Of course, it’s through strength! The Divine Clan is truly foolish—those I killed before were like this, even the Divine Clan’s saint!” Luo Tian coldly spoke, and as his words fell, Tongtian Mountain trembled.

Chapter 905: Refining Void into Saint ()

Tongtian Continent, the largest sect in the realm, now saw its entire mountain trembling under people’s eyes, as if an earthquake.

The sky, previously dim from suppressing Gu Tianshu’s eight characters, now violently churned again, as if preparing for a destructive attack.

“This is the prelude to ascending to the Saintly Realm!” Sun Shengjie’s face bore solemnity as he gazed at the golden hand, imbued with heavenly will, slowly forming in the sky.

“Saintly Realm—whom is it for? Is it Luo Tian!” Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian’s faces bore disbelief. They remembered Luo Tian’s state—how could he ascend while wounded?

Golden light surged as a figure rose, like a rising sun. His youthful face bore infinite confidence; his gaze did not look at Sun Shengjie but toward the sky.

“Refining Void into Saint, refining one’s body!” Luo Tian extended his hand, golden complex talismanic chains surging from his fingers. They wrapped around him, moving along his body.

“Pain!” As the talismanic chains moved, Luo Tian’s first sensation was pain. Yet he clearly felt each chain merging into his body, strengthening his already formidable physique.

Time passed slowly as more chains merged into Luo Tian’s body. In Sun Shengjie’s shock, the final chain also entered his body, making him glow with golden light—like a divine body. His presence rivaled Sun Shengjie’s, even surpassing it!

“Such a formidable physique—should I truly enter the Saintly Realm, I would be no match for him!” Sun Shengjie’s face bore tension as he gazed at Luo Tian, who seemed like a god.

“Roar…” Dragon roars echoed from Luo Tian’s body as his Blue Dragon Body matured, completing its transformation and achieving a qualitative leap.

“Not allowed! This young prodigy must be killed—otherwise, no one among the Nine Realms’ talents would match him. Even the Divine Clan’s princes would be crushed by him. Once Fire Domain produced Gu Tianshu, now the Four Sacred Realms have Luo Tian—both threaten the Divine Clan’s position. He must be eliminated before he grows!” Sun Shengjie’s face bore solemnity as he gazed at the sky, waiting for the Saintly Trial to descend. He knew that now, with his five wounds and seven injuries, he was no match for Luo Tian.

Sun Shengjie dared not act rashly; Wen Chongxiu and Han Guangxian also dared not move. They watched Luo Tian in the sky, envisioning his future dominance over Fire Domain.

“Big Brother Tianyu, is something happening in Tongtian Continent? Why do I sense Heaven’s aura!” Du Yuying and Lu Tianyu appeared slowly outside Tongtian Continent, gazing at the chaotic realm.

“Luo Tian is indeed a prodigy. Perhaps no one in Fire Domain has his talent, except for the former Fire Domain master,” Lu Tianyu’s eyes held admiration but also bitterness.

“Hmph, the Saintly Realm is nothing! Big Brother Tianyu can achieve it too. How could he surpass your talent? The Saintly Realm is a breeze for Big Brother Tianyu!” Du Yuying encouraged, sensing Lu Tianyu’s bitterness.

“Perhaps…” Lu Tianyu smiled faintly, gently patting the girl’s head. Though he knew his talent was not as good as Luo Tian’s, hearing her praise made him happy.

“Boom… boom…” A low rumble echoed in the sky as a golden hand slowly emerged from gray mist, pressing toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s eyes burned with battle spirit; a defiant aura radiated from him as he gazed at the golden hand descending.

“Go away…” Luo Tian coldly snorted, his resentment toward Heaven due to Gu Tianshu’s influence evident. His voice carried no respect as he launched a golden fist toward the sky’s golden hand.

“Crack…” Golden lightning formed in the sky, like a net of thunder, covering it before fading.

“This is only the first strike—his strength allows him to withstand it, which is normal! I await the second and third strikes!” Sun Shengjie’s eyes flashed coldly.

As a veteran of the Saintly Trial, Sun Shengjie knew each subsequent strike grew stronger. He had once used special methods in the Divine Clan to survive his own trial.

Saints, capable of threatening Heaven, must be eliminated by it. Now, Luo Tian was ascending to the Saintly Realm—this golden hand had merely been a test.

Lightning dragons roared as, under everyone’s awe, another golden fist formed within the gray chaos. Luo Tian’s face bore solemnity; he knew this fist posed a significant threat to him. If it struck, he would be severely wounded even if he survived.

“This is the moment!” Sun Shengjie’s face bore excitement, watching the golden fist that even he must approach cautiously. His eyes burned with killing intent as he summoned his spiritual vessel into the sky.

Brilliant light flared as the golden saintly energy, amplified by the spiritual vessel, flowed into the already formidable golden fist.

“Boom…” The void exploded as the enhanced fist solidified, forming countless black holes capable of annihilating any early-stage saint. It seemed to crush Luo Tian.

“Divine Clan’s strength is only this? Cowardly, taking advantage of others! Today I’ll show you what despair means!” Luo Tian’s face bore coldness as he gazed at Sun Shengjie, now seeing him as a dead man to be killed.

“Haha, little beast, think about how to face this Saintly Trial now. If you survive, I know I can’t escape, so I’ll add more difficulty!” Sun Shengjie’s face bore disdain as he mocked Luo Tian, unbothered by the taunts—victory was his.

“Hmph!” Luo Tian coldly snorted, his voice icy as he rapidly moved his hands. A roar of dragons echoed from his dantian, and a golden dragon emerged from his hands, forming into a golden seal.

“Seal of the Heavens! The Buddha’s Attack!” Luo Tian roared, launching the golden seal toward the fist capable of crushing everything.

“This seal could even withstand me—dare you to survive the Saintly Trial?” Sun Shengjie’s face bore disdain as he gazed at the golden seal.

Though Luo Tian’s current strength made his Seal of the Heavens more powerful, it was still insufficient against the fist imbued with Sun Shengjie’s saintly energy.

“Crack…” Thunder roared as golden lightning pierced the void, creating a storm of golden saintly energy that swept across the sky.

The golden fist, however, pressed on, instantly appearing above Luo Tian’s head, causing his legs to slightly bend.

“Great danger hides great opportunity!” Luo Tian recalled Gu Tianshu’s words when he first emerged and the latter’s actions during his own Saintly Trial.

“Though my physique is strong, it’s still not enough! To enter the early-stage Saintly Realm, I must be the strongest. Thus, I’ll learn from Gu Tianshu and use the Saintly Trial to refine my body!” Luo Tian’s face burned with battle spirit as he let the golden fist strike him.

“Die! Though you’re a prodigy, no one has ever succeeded using this method—among the ten thousand talents who tried, none succeeded. Even Gu Tianshu’s success was a coincidence!” Sun Shengjie sneered, watching Luo Tian deliberately let the Saintly Trial strike him.

Luo Tian had no time to respond before the golden fist, brimming with heavenly power, struck him.

“Spit…!” Luo Tian spat golden saintly blood, staining Tongtian Mountain’s wall.

“Crack…” After spitting blood, Luo Tian’s golden body emitted a sound of bones cracking.

“Hold on!” Luo Tian roared, his voice filled with defiance as he recalled Gu Tianshu’s method of refining his body.

Golden saintly energy flowed, wrapping the golden fist’s wild aura and surging into his dantian. It struck his dantian’s spring, causing a deafening explosion.

The explosion was overwhelming; after striking Luo Tian’s dantian, it cracked instantly.

“Let me merge!” Luo Tian forced himself to stay conscious, his face contorted with determination.

The golden fist, under the awe of all, crashed into Tongtian Continent, creating deep pits that were bottomless and terrifying.

Chapter 906: Entering the Saintly Realm ()

Tongtian Continent, people stared in awe at the bottomless pits. Their eyes twitched; they could sense the destruction of the golden fist, capable of annihilating any life.
