“Indeed!” Luo Tian nodded, sensing the disdain in the other’s eyes. There was no need to guess what they were thinking—after all, he had encountered countless offspring of the ancient kings. None of them ever held humans in high regard.

“Take this chance and leave,” Fu Tu spoke coldly, his voice devoid of warmth. “This time I shall let you go. The Star Moon Divine Clan does not need to ally with humans!”

“Hmph,” hearing Fu Tu’s words, Luo Tian furrowed his brows. Yet, he was currently within the Star Moon Divine Clan’s domain and had received their kindness. He merely nodded slightly.

“Very well, then I shall take my leave,” Luo Tian bowed respectfully to Fu Wenbin and the others before exchanging a glance with Fu Xingyue. He then rose and strode toward the palace’s entrance.

“This…” The people within the hall were taken aback. They all knew Luo Tian’s temperament; to not turn hostile was already a courtesy.

“Alas…” Fu Cangshan and Fu Wenbin sat there, letting out long sighs. They had not expected Fu Tu to escalate matters so drastically. Their efforts to draw Luo Tian into the Star Moon Divine Clan’s fold had been in vain, as Fu Tu had planted a seed of resentment within Luo Tian.

“I know what you are thinking,” Fu Tu’s face bore an air of confidence. “This life, I shall attain the Dao!”

“Truly a boastful fool!” Fu Xingxue thought, her expression laced with disdain. Though Fu Tu was an ancient king’s offspring and formidable, everyone knew this was a great era—no one could predict how many powerful adversaries would emerge during the Dao’s attainment.

Fu Xingxuan furrowed her brows slightly before bowing respectfully to Fu Wenbin and Fu Cangshan. “My thanks, esteemed guardians. I must take my leave; returning to the clan, there are still many matters awaiting my attention.”

“Ah, Xingxuan,” Fu Wenbin called out before she could depart. “The clan’s affairs can wait—there is something we must discuss with you.”

“What is it?” Fu Xingxuan’s brows furrowed again. Her gaze met Fu Tu’s, and an ominous premonition stirred within her.

“You see,” Fu Tu said with a smile, as if transformed. “I have just awakened and require a wife to attend me. But who could I, Fu Tu, deign to notice? Thus, I consulted with the guardians and wished for your union.”

“The guardians agreed. After all, it is beneficial for both parties,” Fu Tu gazed at Fu Xingxuan with admiration.

“Perfect!” From the moment he laid eyes on Fu Xingxuan, Fu Tu had resolved to claim her. Even among the ancient kings of yore, he had never encountered a woman as flawless as Fu Xingxuan.

Yet, as Fu Tu’s words settled, the atmosphere in the hall grew cold. Fu Xingxuan furrowed her brows and cast a glance toward Fu Cangshan and Fu Wenbin.

Fu Cangshan and Fu Wenbin exchanged a wry smile. They had not anticipated Fu Tu’s directness, nor his inclusion of them in the matter.

“Still, it is a good match,” Fu Cangshan and Fu Wenbin exchanged thoughts. After brief deliberation, they deemed Fu Tu’s reasoning sound.

“Xingxuan,” Fu Wenbin spoke softly, his gaze filled with concern. Though Fu Cangshan and Fu Tu were unaware of her thoughts, he knew well what she felt.

“Senior Guardian,” Fu Xingxuan shook her head gently. “You know well what I think. Moreover, I have no inclination toward such matters now. Let us drop this.”

“Hmph?” Hearing Fu Xingxuan’s immediate refusal, Fu Tu’s expression darkened. He had expected her to joyfully accept his proposal—after all, his bloodline was unparalleled. To unite with him would be a blessing for Fu Xingxuan.

“Do you dare defy me?” Fu Tu’s gaze locked onto Fu Xingxuan, his voice laced with coldness.

“Indeed, I do. I have no desire to marry now,” Fu Xingxuan replied resolutely.

Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang stood behind Fu Xingxuan, their gazes filled with admiration. They supported her decision.

“Lord Fu Tu,” Fu Tianqing, seeing the awkwardness, spoke softly. “Xingxuan has always been indulged; her judgment is lacking. Please grant her time to consider.”

“Smack!” Before Fu Tianqing could finish, a sharp slap echoed through the hall. Everyone was taken aback.

Fu Tianqing remained seated, but his aged face had shifted slightly, and a clear handprint marked it.

“Let me make one thing clear,” Fu Tu said coldly. “What I say is law. Without my father, would the Star Moon Divine Clan have achieved this power?”

“Who did you strike?” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang’s faces darkened as they shouted at Fu Tu.

Fu Tianqing was no ordinary figure in the Star Moon Divine Clan. He was their grandfather, and now a young man had struck him—this could not be tolerated, even for an ancient king’s offspring.

Fu Tianqing’s expression was grim. He had not expected Fu Tu to strike him in such a setting, and he had been caught off guard. Yet, he shook his head at Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang: “Silence.”

“Apologize to my grandfather!” Fu Xingxuan’s cold voice echoed through the hall.

“Apologize?” Fu Tu laughed as if hearing the funniest joke. He rose slowly from his seat, his gaze filled with arrogance.

“A mere epoch peak—what is the worth of such a person? I struck him, and that was it. Back then, even those formidable masters surrounded me like flies; I did not even bother to strike them.”

“And you, a woman—now I give you another chance. Join me, or the position of Star Moon Emperor shall not be yours,” Fu Tu said softly, his voice calm yet commanding.

“Xingxuan, do not overthink it. Fu Tu’s words are reasonable,” Fu Cangshan spoke after Fu Tu’s words, his voice laced with a hint of anger.

The air in the hall stilled. Luo Tian, who had just exited the palace, overheard the commotion and furrowed his brows.

Regardless of Fu Xingxuan’s situation, Fu Tu’s strike against Fu Tianqing was enough to ignite Luo Tian’s fury.

Fu Tianqing had shown him kindness, taught him the secrets of nature, and shielded him from many troubles. Especially after Luo Tian learned that Fu Tianqing had fought three equals to protect him, suffering heavy injuries and spending two years recovering in the Star Moon Divine Clan.

Luo Tian was a man of deep gratitude. He repaid every kindness he received, and Fu Tianqing had done much for him—Luo Tian would never forget.

As for Fu Xingxuan, Luo Tian felt guilt. Though he could not grant her happiness, he wished for her to live a fulfilling life.

“Impossible! My fate must be decided by myself!” Fu Xingxuan stood in the hall, declaring firmly.

“Xingxuan, I have chosen you. That is your fortune!” Fu Tu ascended with pride, slowly approaching her.

“Xingxuan, since ancient times, a daughter’s marriage is decided by the parents. As the elder of the Star Moon Divine Clan, I shall decide your fate,” Fu Cangshan spoke again, his voice laced with a hint of anger.

A准王’s wrath cast the hall into silence. Fu Wenbin furrowed his brows, for he favored Fu Xingxuan—she had grown under his care. Yet Fu Cangshan and Fu Tu, long dormant, had only recently awakened.

Yet Fu Cangshan’s words were reasonable. He had previously intended to marry Fu Xingxuan to Luo Tian, binding him to the Star Moon Divine Clan. But Luo Tian had clearly refused, leaving Fu Wenbin no grounds to defy the elder.

Though Fu Wenbin had also ascended to准王, he was still new and lagged behind Fu Cangshan in strength.

“If I refuse?” Fu Xingxuan countered defiantly, her purple eyes blazing with light as she met Fu Tu’s gaze.

Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang stood behind her, their eyes glowing with determination. Fu Tianqing also rose from his seat and joined them.

Two epoch peak guardians sat silently, neither moving nor speaking—uncertain of their stance.

“Hah! The young are formidable indeed. To defy me!” Fu Tu laughed, scanning the four of them.

“Do you dare rebel?” Fu Cangshan narrowed his eyes, his gaze scanning the four.

“Rebel? Elder, your words are harsh. The Star Moon Divine Clan has always been managed by us. How can we rebel?” Fu Xingyue replied.

“Then you mean the Star Moon Divine Clan is now yours? Are my elder and the ancient king’s offspring rebelling?” Fu Cangshan’s face darkened at Fu Xingyue’s words.

“You are the elder, and we shall respect you. But Xingxuan is a non-negotiable condition. She is not an object; she is our princess. We will not let her suffer any harm,” Fu Xingyang spoke with deep resolve.

“I grant you a chance. If the four of you can defeat me, I shall drop this matter. If not, she must marry me,” Fu Tu declared.

“Clang!” As Fu Tu’s words echoed, Luo Tian re-entered the hall, a smile on his face as he stepped behind Fu Xingxuan and her companions.

“Why have you returned?” The people in the hall, surprised to find someone outside the palace, glanced at Luo Tian.

“I am the Grand Commander of the Star Moon Guard. Naturally, I must obey the Emperor’s orders,” Luo Tian said with a smile.

“You are an human. How dare you involve yourself in the Star Moon Divine Clan’s affairs? You seek death! That I let you leave is my mercy. Yet, you still do not show gratitude?” Fu Tu’s face darkened with anger, his eyes flashing with killing intent.

“Fu Cangshan, kill this human!” Fu Tu turned to Fu Cangshan, who sat there.

“Impossible!” Hearing Fu Tu’s words, Fu Wenbin could no longer remain silent. Though Fu Tu did not know Luo Tian, Fu Wenbin knew the depth of his power.

“This matter requires careful consideration,” Fu Cangshan gazed at Luo Tian, recalling the terrifying strength of Gu Tianshu, Dongbo Xin, and Ji Jiuyou. He sighed deeply.

“Since you will not act, I shall do it myself,” Fu Tu’s anger had been fully ignited.

Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingxuan, and Fu Xingyang knew they could not act against him. Three of them held deep roots in the Star Moon Divine Clan, and now eight out of ten forces were under their control. If they moved against them, the clan would surely be in turmoil.

But Luo Tian was different. Though he had learned why the Star Moon Divine Clan sought his alliance, it did not matter to him. As an ancient king’s offspring, he was proud and confident in his invincibility at his level. He did not care for Luo Tian’s talent.

As for Luo Tian’s forces, Fu Tu also dismissed them. The royal clan was revered by all tribes; his support extended beyond the Star Moon Divine Clan to include the ancient tribes.

“Did your words still hold?” Luo Tian asked Fu Tu, his voice calm as he ignored the latter’s killing intent.

“Of course. But whether it holds or not, you are still dead,” Fu Tu ignored the location and raised his hand. A vast blue palm descended upon Luo Tian.

Luo Tian, however, remained smiling. He stood with his arms crossed. Now at the epoch peak, as a reincarnation body, he was confident that even against Fu Wenbin’s准王-level strength, he could withstand a few blows.

“Boom!” The blue palm, laden with immense pressure, struck Luo Tian’s body. His figure slightly sank under the impact. A violent gust of wind erupted from their collision, blowing Luo Tian and his companions’ robes.

“Indeed formidable!” Fu Tu’s eyes narrowed slightly before a deep interest surfaced.

“This matter shall proceed as discussed. If Fu Tu wins, Xingxuan will marry him. If any of you win, she shall marry Luo Tian,” Fu Cangshan spoke softly.

“Cunning old fox!” Luo Tian thought, his gaze locking onto Fu Cangshan. He immediately understood Fu Cangshan’s intention.

Fu Cangshan, as the elder of the Star Moon Divine Clan, sought to benefit the entire clan. If Fu Tu won, uniting with an ancient king’s offspring would strengthen the Star Moon Divine Clan. If Luo Tian won, Fu Xingxuan marrying him would forge an alliance with his forces—both scenarios were beneficial for the clan.

Luo Tian could have refused, but Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang would face a battle against Fu Tu. Their chances were slim, and that was not what Luo Tian desired.

“What to do?” Luo Tian found himself in a dilemma. He bit his teeth and nodded—no matter what, he would not let Fu Xingxuan marry someone she did not love. That was his limit.

“Arrogant fool!” Fu Tu’s face turned cold as he gazed at Luo Tian, his aura rising.

“Hum!” Fu Cangshan moved his hands, sending waves of energy that transported the four into a newly created small world.

“Begin!” Fu Cangshan addressed Luo Tian and Fu Tu. He was also curious about how strong they had become after disappearing for twenty years.

“Brother, rely on you!” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang transmitted their thoughts to Luo Tian, hoping he would win so the matter would simplify.

“An ancient king’s offspring—have I not fought one before?” Luo Tian took a step forward, standing beneath the stars as he gazed at Fu Tu.

“You seek death! No one else is to blame!” Fu Tu’s eyes gleamed like stars, radiating an intimidating light. His figure vanished from his spot and appeared before Luo Tian in an instant, launching a fist of starlight toward him.

“Who is the arrogant one? That remains to be seen!” Luo Tian replied coldly, his unparalleled body radiating divine light. He countered with a punch.

“Crack!” Thunder crackled as their fists collided instantly, and both figures were sent flying backward.

“Indeed an ancient king’s offspring! His body is stronger than even the魂!” Luo Tian muttered, observing the cracks on his fist as they gradually healed.

“His body is formidable. But it’s useless!” Fu Tu’s eyes darkened, but his battle spirit surged. He stepped through the stars and rushed toward Luo Tian again.

“Fear you? I do not!” Luo Tian roared, showing no fear. He launched another punch toward Fu Tu.

Chapter 1523: The Power of the Ancient King’s Offspring

In the small world beneath the stars, Luo Tian and Fu Tu clashed repeatedly. The thunderous sound of their collisions echoed constantly, sending waves of power outward.

Luo Tian’s body radiated divine light. His unparalleled body and bloodline made him fearless against the so-called strongest bloodline of an ancient king. He clashed with Fu Tu, even subtly suppressing him.

On the other hand, Fu Tu was astonished. He had initially looked down on Luo Tian but now felt a growing sense of respect and even fear as their battles continued.

“How strong!” Fu Tu was sent flying thousands of feet, his lips bleeding and his body riddled with cracks.

Luo Tian was also battered, his face pale but his aura still formidable. The sight of their battle left Fu Wenbin and Fu Cangshan, along with two peak guardians, in shock.

“This Luo Tian’s body is so strong! Even an ancient king’s offspring could not match him!” Fu Cangshan spoke softly, his voice laced with awe. Though he was a准王, he had been deeply impressed by Luo Tian.

“This is why we sought to ally with him. His talent was remarkable, and he stood behind three top human masters!” Fu Wenbin’s eyes glowed with admiration. The sight of Luo Tian after reaching the epoch peak had made him even more optimistic.

“Hum!” As they spoke, a piercing hum echoed through the stars. A blue moon emerged from Fu Tu’s hands, glowing with cold light and a chilling aura. It ascended to his head.

“Blue Ice Moon!” Fu Tu roared, then pointed his finger. The cold moon pierced through space and descended upon Luo Tian.

“Divine King’s Nine Heavens Map!” Luo Tian moved his hands, and nine great continents formed an ultimate divine map. It surged toward the cold moon with immense power.

Both techniques were formidable, and their clash sent shockwaves through the stars. Even Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang felt immense pressure.

“Boom!” The thunderous collision of the two techniques created a deafening explosion. Both Luo Tian and Fu Tu’s faces turned pale.

Especially the violent gusts that struck them sent both flying backward, revealing the intensity of their clash.

“Again!” Luo Tian roared, his aura surging as he rushed toward Fu Tu.

“Great Dao Sealing Demon!” Luo Tian’s fist struck the wild gusts, dispersing them before he slammed Fu Tu with a punch.

“Another body clash?” Fu Wenbin and the others exchanged puzzled glances, watching Luo Tian charge in with admiration.

“Get out…” Fu Tu roared again, clashing with Luo Tian. They exchanged blows repeatedly until Fu Tu was sent flying once more.

“Try this!” Fu Tu coughed blood, clearly wounded from their clash. Yet he raised his hand again and slashed through the void.

“Hum!” His finger glided, and a massive star, ten thousand feet in diameter, formed at his fingertips. It descended like a meteor toward Luo Tian.

“Fierce God’s Wrath, Trampling the Nine Heavens!” Luo Tian sneered and summoned a divine god’s shadow behind him. His thick foot stomped down on the star.

“Boom!” The thunderous collision shattered the massive star, and his golden foot sent waves of epoch power outward.

“Damn! This won’t work!” Fu Tu’s eyes flashed with coldness. He gritted his teeth.

“One won’t do, so nine! I’ll see how long you can endure!” Fu Tu’s eyes gleamed with madness. He could not accept losing his first battle after awakening, expecting to crush Luo Tian and win Fu Xingxuan.

But he had not anticipated Luo Tian’s strength. He was no less formidable than an ancient king’s offspring, surpassing Fu Tu’s expectations.

“One… two…” Stars fell from the sky, each radiating immense power as they descended upon Luo Tian.

“Fierce God’s Second Stomp, Shattering the Stars!”

“Fierce God’s Third Stomp, Scaring the Gods…”

“Fierce God’s Seventh Stomp, Shattering Eternity!” Luo Tian’s aura surged. The divine god’s figure became tangible, and his golden foot stomped repeatedly. Each step shattered a star.

The thunderous sound echoed endlessly, shaking the small world as if it would be torn apart. The power of epoch peak was evident, especially for such prodigies as Luo Tian and Fu Tu. Even Fu Wenbin, newly ascended to准王, was awestruck.

Nine stars shattered. Luo Tian’s divine god shadow faded slightly as he panted, standing beneath the stars with a smile toward Fu Tu.

“Now it’s my turn!” Luo Tian’s hands moved swiftly, his robes fluttering. A golden vortex spun rapidly above his head, emitting a mournful sound that filled the stars with an immense and terrifying aura.

“Why is his technique so strong?” Fu Tu’s eyes were heavy with awe. As an ancient king’s offspring, he knew every technique was a royal method. Yet he had not expected Luo Tian to possess such power, each move as terrifying as his own.

As Fu Tu was stunned, a golden interception seal formed in Luo Tian’s hands. It descended with immense power toward Fu Tu.

Under the overwhelming pressure, Fu Tu’s body emitted a series of cracks.

“Chaotic Time and Space!” Fu Tu moved his hands, summoning a golden hand that appeared above his head. It grabbed the stars with a sound like firecrackers, but ten thousand times louder.

“Hum…” After the explosion, the hum echoed. The stars above Fu Tu’s head began to twist and warp.

“Chaotic Time and Space! A technique of our clan’s kings. We have never seen it before!” The observers gasped, watching the twisted space.

“An ancient king’s offspring is truly powerful!” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang said, their faces filled with admiration as they watched Fu Tu’s overwhelming power.

Though Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang were confident, they knew from their battle with Luo Tian that they still had a gap compared to him and Fu Tu.

“Truly pitiful!” Fu Xingyue sighed. His talent had made him invincible, but first he met Luo Tian, then other ancient king’s offspring and epoch masters. Each was more formidable than the last, leaving them depressed.

“Ten thousand feet… a thousand feet…” The interception seal descended with immense power, striking Fu Tu’s head.

But the massive seal stopped at a hundred feet above Fu Tu’s head.

“Boom!” The powerful seal exploded in Luo Tian’s shock, dispersing into a surge of energy that spread outward.

“What technique is this!” Luo Tian was utterly stunned. He had never encountered such a situation before.

Though the interception seal was shattered, its powerful gusts still struck Fu Tu’s body, leaving wounds across his form. Yet Fu Tu seemed unaffected, extending his hands and emitting invisible waves that made Luo Tian’s face shift slightly.

In an instant, a star and a full moon formed above Fu Tu’s head. The entire small world's stars trembled, as an invisible aura converged on the star and moon.

“This…” Fu Wenbin and others gazed at the powerful star and moon above Fu Tu’s head, their eyes filled with awe.

“Star Moon Combined Technique!” Fu Cangshan’s face lit up with excitement. He watched the star and moon colliding in Fu Tu’s hands, exclaiming.

Ancient king’s offspring held high status partly due to their noble bloodline. Another reason was that upon awakening, they could display many kings’ techniques—benefiting both the clan and sacred places.

“Manifesting the Dao of Heaven and Earth!” Luo Tian’s eyes first showed concern. He felt a strong threat from the colliding star and moon but could not retreat, only to face it head-on.

Chapter 1524: I Still Have a Secret Card

“Manifesting the Dao of Heaven and Earth!” Facing Fu Tu’s apocalyptic attack, Luo Tian did not underestimate it. He immediately revealed his ultimate state.

“Ten feet… a hundred feet… a thousand feet…” In an instant, Luo Tian’s body surged and grew to a thousand feet tall. He stood beneath the stars.

Luo Tian was now at the epoch peak, having trained for years. In the tomb’s altar, he had not merely annihilated figures of epoch power but had practiced all his techniques.

“This is the technique of the human clan’s Gu Tianshu!” Fu Cangshan and Fu Wenbin shuddered instinctively. Their eyes blurred, recalling the battle twenty years ago—the white-cloaked figure who had made them feel despair.

Even the high-level kings of ancient tribes believed Gu Tianshu or Dongbo Xin might attain the Dao in this epoch. Their strength was simply too formidable.

“Boom!” As Luo Tian’s body grew, Fu Tu’s two powerful energies collided.

“Destroying Heaven and Earth!” An immense power spread across the stars. Fu Tu’s head saw space chaos, with stars and moons colliding and merging into a destructive force. Fu Tu pushed it toward Luo Tian’s massive body.

“Die!” Fu Tu’s eyes flashed with mockery. His face was pale, and he spat blood into the overwhelming aura.

At that moment, Fu Tu’s body seemed to shrink slightly. This technique had drained him significantly.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” After Fu Tu’s blood merged into the aura, thunderous sounds echoed through the stars. The space fractured, and the apocalyptic waves even made Fu Cangshan and Fu Wenbin feel a surge of fear.

“Hum…” The Star Moon Divine Spear flew from Fu Xingxuan’s hands, scattering divine laws and enveloping everyone.

“Roar!” Luo Tian roared to the sky. Though he felt the terror of that energy, he also felt his own immense power—capable of tearing through space. The entire world seemed to tremble beneath his feet.

“Fierce God’s Seventh Stomp, Shattering Eternity!” The fierce god’s figure reappeared and merged with Luo Tian. A golden foot stepped forward, its complex patterns flowing on his right leg instead of the divine marks—this was the梵天攻杀大术.

Luo Tian recited the Feathered Immortal Scripture, a technique that overcame all methods. It continuously infused into his body, making his aura even more supreme.

Under the expectant gazes of all, the golden foot collided with that terrifying energy. The thunderous sound shook space and instantly engulfed Luo Tian and Fu Tu, making the small world seem to boil.

The sea of energy surged. Under the divine laws of the Star Moon Divine Spear, Fu Xingyue and others gazed in awe. Even Fu Cangshan and Fu Wenbin, two准王-levels, were awestruck by the strength of Luo Tian and Fu Tu.

“Prepare to act!” Fu Cangshan addressed Fu Wenbin. He could sense that after this powerful collision, both Luo Tian and Fu Tu would surely be severely injured. If they continued fighting, one of them would certainly perish—this was not what they wanted.

Luo Tian had now truly earned Fu Cangshan’s respect, not because of his backing from Gu Tianshu and others.

After nearly an hour, the wild waves finally calmed. Luo Tian and Fu Tu appeared in their sight.

Yet both were in a terrible state, the stars in disarray. Fu Tu looked weak and hovered there.

Luo Tian was also bloodied, panting heavily. His body was riddled with fierce wounds. His massive form had returned to normal size, and his chest caved in, revealing white bones.

“Again!” Luo Tian roared to the sky. Though wounded, three of his nine immortal reincarnations had been destroyed.

Yet his eyes remained fixed on Fu Tu, who was still hovering with closed eyes. He rushed toward him despite his injuries.

“Come on!” Fu Tu slowly opened his eyes, adjusting himself. His voice was weak.

But before Fu Tu could finish speaking, Luo Tian appeared before him, bloodied and charging. He stepped on Fu Tu’s handsome face.

“Boom!” Fu Tu’s face deformed under Luo Tian’s foot. His body fell again, plummeting into the stars.

“Who dares strike my master?” Luo Tian gazed at Fu Tu’s falling body, his face cold. He followed and grabbed Fu Tu by the neck.

“Luo Tian!” Fu Cangshan and Fu Wenbin saw Fu Tu in Luo Tian’s grip. Their faces changed instantly, fearing Luo Tian might do something reckless. After all, he had a history of killing sacred sons and ancient king’s offspring.

“Don’t worry. I know what I’m doing,” Luo Tian took a deep breath, gazing at Fu Cangshan and Fu Wenbin.

“Smack!” As Luo Tian spoke, his hand swung again, striking Fu Tu’s face.

“Who dares strike my master? You are the first. If not for owing the Star Moon Divine Clan a favor, you would already be dead!” Luo Tian spoke again, repeatedly striking Fu Tu’s face.

“Alas…” Fu Tianqing sighed deeply. His eyes showed satisfaction. Though Luo Tian had struck a member of the Star Moon Divine Clan, Fu Tu’s actions had indeed embarrassed him.

“Deserved!” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang’s eyes also showed satisfaction. They watched Fu Tu, whose head seemed about to be split open by Luo Tian.

“Indeed, you are capable!” Fu Xingxuan clenched her fists. Her purple eyes glowed with light, gazing at Luo Tian with admiration.

“This must be his most attractive quality—his loyalty,” Fu Xingxuan thought. A decision formed in her heart, and with this thought, her eyes gradually brightened.

“Roar!” Fu Tu roared continuously but seemed to have his life thread caught by Luo Tian. He had no strength left, and the epoch power in his body was nearly depleted.

“Enough,” Luo Tian had no intention of killing Fu Tu. But to avenge Fu Tianqing and prevent Fu Xingxuan from marrying Fu Tu, he had no choice but to act.

“Indeed, the ancient king’s offspring is formidable. I used all my tricks to defeat him!” Luo Tian tossed Fu Tu aside, sighing.

Though Luo Tian had seemingly dominated Fu Tu in their battle, it was only because of himself. If others were in his place, they might have been crushed by Fu Tu as he had expected.

“Fu Tu is not weak. It’s just that Luo Tian is even more abnormal!” Fu Wenbin’s eyes also held a hint of amusement. This outcome was what he had hoped for—Luo Tian’s strength proved his judgment was correct.

“Indeed, I am old,” the other two epoch peak guardians sighed. They gazed at Luo Tian, Fu Xingxuan, and Fu Xingyue with admiration.
