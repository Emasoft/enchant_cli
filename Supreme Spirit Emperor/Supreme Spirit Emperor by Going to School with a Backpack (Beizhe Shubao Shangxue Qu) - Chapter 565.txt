Chapter 2151: The Enigma of the Tree Soul
Above the Rotating Palace, a colossal turtle shell floated in the air, its surface filled with ashen liquid that exuded an unsettling aura.
Thousands of people stood atop the shell, their eyes alight with anticipation as they gazed at the murky liquid within.
"Trusting one's wife was the right choice!" Luo Tian mused, watching Su Dan gently push him away. His eyes held a flicker of amusement; this time, he felt no fear but instead a predatory gaze directed at Su Dan.
"Ten days of this Looping Pool's trial have begun! All disciples, enter swiftly!" A resounding voice echoed, and instantly, the crowd leapt downward like falling dumplings into the ashen liquid.
"Little Brother Luo Chen, come on—remember to massage my back!" Su Dan's hand was warm as she pulled Luo Tian toward the pool.
"Plip..." The water surged, and in an instant, both Luo Tian and Su Dan plunged into the Looping Pool.
"Buzz..." Upon entering, waves of energy enveloped Luo Tian, an irresistible force that altered his surroundings. His vision turned gray.
Luo Tian's eyelids grew heavy, while Su Dan had already closed her eyes, as if asleep.
After an indeterminate time, Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, confusion etched on his face as he surveyed the surroundings.
The world was pitch-black, like a hellish landscape. Luo Tian lay on the cold ground, surrounded by dense black forests.
He shifted his body and noticed something soft in his hand. His eyes snapped open, and he quickly withdrew it.
A woman clad in black robes stood beside him, her snow-white skin exposed, radiating an intoxicating fragrance. Her presence was undeniably alluring.
As Luo Tian withdrew his hand, the woman stirred and opened her eyes.
"Persistent as ever!" Luo Tian sighed, glancing at his hand before looking at Su Dan lying beside him.
"Little Brother Luo Chen, why are you staring? Do you have ill intentions?" Su Dan opened her eyes and caught Luo Tian's gaze, a playful yet dismissive glint in her eyes.
Luo Tian's face flushed red, then he coughed lightly and stood up, scanning the dense forest.
"Where are we?" Luo Tian asked softly, his voice tinged with unease as he shifted the topic.
"This is the Looping Realm. If we find a suitable place to cultivate, ten years of training here will allow us to exit when the pool's water dries up!"
"Even if we die here, in reality, we'll simply be expelled from the Looping Pool. It's like a dream, but our strength will truly improve. Want to indulge? There's nothing to fear!" Su Dan's lips curled with temptation, her gaze flicking toward Luo Tian.
"I'll pass; I'm quite upright!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, declining swiftly.
"Ugh, a man with desire but no courage!" Su Dan shot him a glance before continuing.
"Of course, there might be opportunities to seize here. If we team up, no one can match us! You must protect your elder sister!" Su Dan smiled, approaching Luo Tian.
"Fine, fine," Luo Tian felt a headache. He would rather fight a hundred battles than be with Su Dan.
Though he knew she was faking it, this was unbearable for most people.
"Come on, I've entered the Looping Pool before, so I have more experience!" Su Dan grabbed his hand and led him out of the forest.
"By the way, there might be dangers here, but we can't rule out surprises. After all, this liquid's origin is unknown, so vigilance is necessary!" Su Dan warned, her tone more solemn.
"Right," Luo Tian nodded, allowing Su Dan to guide him through the forest.
The woods were vast; after half an hour, they hadn't exited and saw no one else.
"Strange... this forest is huge, yet we've walked so long without exiting," Su Dan frowned, halting.
She waved her hands, and black mist spilled from them, forming countless black butterflies that scattered in all directions.
Luo Tian extended his spiritual awareness, frowning as he sensed something peculiar about the forest.
"No exit! This is a natural maze!" Su Dan declared, her face darkening.
"Indeed," Luo Tian nodded, realizing his spiritual senses only reached a hundred feet before being blocked.
"Let's break through!" Su Dan murmured, her aura sharpening.
Luo Tian nodded; he had no good methods against natural mazes, even if Wan Lingkong were here.
"Buzz..." Luo Tian drew his sword, Long Yuan, and unleashed a black blade of energy toward the row of black trees.
"Crack..." The sound of splintering wood echoed as trees fell before them.
"Wonderful, Little Brother Luo Chen!" Su Dan leapt into the air, rushing toward the fallen trees.
"..."
Luo Tian was speechless, following Su Dan as he continuously slashed with his sword, becoming a woodcutter.
Another half hour passed; their speed was fast, yet they still hadn't exited the forest.
"Impossible! We can't leave unless we destroy this entire forest!" Luo Tian panted, standing still.
Around them, black trees lay scattered, yet they seemed endless.
"No problem; we can just cultivate here for ten years and leave!" Su Dan sighed, defeated. She hadn't expected to be trapped so soon.
"Buzz..." As their words faded, gray mist rose from the felled trees.
"What is this?" Luo Tian's face shifted; he sensed a hint of soul energy in the mist.
"Soul energy? Have these trees become sentient?" Su Dan's expression darkened.
As they marveled, a gray mist formed into a tree shadow before them, radiating immense power that made their faces tense.
"Ten... a hundred..." Soon, gray tree shadows surrounded Luo Tian and Su Dan.
"Bang!" The ground trembled as more gray tree souls emerged behind them.
The soul pressure made Su Dan's face pale, but Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with light.
"Buzz..." A thick gray branch swung like a giant hand toward them.
Su Dan flicked her fingers, forming a black blade that rushed toward the branch.
The black blade pierced through the gray branch but failed to stop it.
"Combat techniques and physical attacks are ineffective!" Su Dan gasped, her body swaying as she vanished.
"Done for! We won't be trapped here by these tree souls, will we? It's embarrassing to be expelled so soon!" Su Dan's voice carried resignation.
"Little Brother Luo Chen, don't just stand there!" Su Dan shouted as she saw Luo Tian frozen.
"Bang!" As Su Dan's words ended, countless massive tree souls surrounded them, their gray branches blocking the sky and pressing down.
"I think we can leave now!" As Su Dan grew anxious, Luo Tian's face broke into a smile.
"Indeed! We've exited the Looping Pool!" Su Dan unleashed soul energy from her hands, determined not to give up.
"Stop!" Just as Su Dan's soul energy dispersed, Luo Tian's voice echoed in her ear.
This voice was calm yet carried immense pressure, making Su Dan's face shift slightly. The gray branches halted mid-attack.
"This!" Su Dan's eyes flashed, gazing at Luo Tian beside her. She had also released soul energy and felt the pressure on her soul—unresistable.
"Rustle..." The tree souls trembled, retracting their branches without moving.
"Lead us out!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his tone commanding.
Hearing this, the tree souls walked toward the forest's depths.
"Come on; we can leave now!" Luo Tian smiled, following the trembling tree souls.
"Absolute control over soul energy!" Su Dan's mind roiled, gazing at Luo Tian's back. She recalled his feat of defeating Duan Boyang in the Immortal King's domain.

Chapter 2152: The Yin-Yang Tribe
"Perhaps this is why he became a saint's heir," Su Dan's eyes gleamed, finally sensing Luo Tian's uniqueness.
Su Dan had previously regarded Luo Tian with special interest because he had deciphered her small tricks when they first met, prompting her to tease him repeatedly. She aimed to test Luo Tian's resolve.
Su Dan sought his support because she had inherited the throne of King Zun Gui, but some resisted her. In this Rotating Palace, she needed allies to solidify her position.
Initially, she had approached Fu Xingxuan because she was the saintess and could be manipulated.
Yet Su Dan didn't reject women as men did; they became close friends after interacting.
With Luo Tian, Su Dan naturally used her advantages to win him over—herself. She aimed to conquer Luo Tian for her own use.
But Su Dan's repeated teasing left Luo Tian unmoved, fueling her determination to conquer him.
Su Dan's eyes flashed with resolve as she chased after Luo Tian, grabbing his arm.
Luo Tian didn't mind, allowing her to pull him as they followed the tree souls for half an hour until exiting the black forest.
Upon leaving, the view opened up; a black sun hung in the sky.
The demon sun radiated intense heat, cracking the earth beneath their feet with a crisp sound.
"Such heat!" Su Dan's eyes showed confusion, gazing at the demon sun. She wore little clothing, but their cultivation levels should have made them immune to ordinary heat.
Yet this world's heat felt oppressive, a stark contrast to the forest's cold.
After half an hour of walking, Luo Tian's head began to sweat. Fortunately, Long Yuan's cold aura eased his discomfort.
But Luo Tian had Long Yuan; Su Dan was less fortunate, her black robes soaked with sweat, revealing her perfect figure. Her forehead glistened with perspiration.
Despite their cultivation, they couldn't withstand the extreme heat.
"Strange... this Looping Pool wasn't like this before. Though it had dangers, there were no soul entities," Su Dan frowned.
"What kind of world is this?"
"If we're still in the Looping Pool, why does this happen?" Luo Tian marveled.
He surveyed the endless cracked earth, frowning as he took flight to scan the horizon. Yet all he saw was a vast expanse of dry land.
"Someone!" He then spotted two figures.
"Go..." Luo Tian called to Su Dan, but she swayed, her face flushed.
"How are you?" Luo Tian returned to Su Dan's side, pressing his hand against her forehead. He sensed a fever.
"Fire toxin?" Luo Tian immediately deduced Su Dan's condition, unsealing a part of Long Yuan's seal. A wave of cold energy surged into her body.
"Ugh..." Su Dan took a deep breath, her voice sultry as she smiled.
"Come on; I saw people. Let's check who they are!" Luo Tian spoke softly, heading toward the figures.
"I can't move!" Su Dan panted, her face grim.
"Only a little fire toxin? It shouldn't trouble you!" Luo Tian shook his head.
"Can't you be tender? I really can't move!" Su Dan frowned, sensing her condition was poor.
Though a bit of cold energy had eased it, the fire toxin seemed stubborn, requiring her to use cultivation to fight it.
"Can't I carry you?" Luo Tian shook his head, feeling hot himself. The thought of the seductive scene made him uncomfortable.
"Something's wrong!"
"I felt unwell before, but not this intense!" Luo Tian sensed something amiss.
Su Dan's face was flushed; her gaze toward Luo Tian softened, and she too was startled.
Both were not ordinary people; they exchanged a glance, immediately sensing the issue, their eyes turning to the demon sun.
"Damn! This isn't regular fire toxin!" They spoke simultaneously, their faces darkening.
"Not possible!" Luo Tian sighed bitterly, drawing Long Yuan, its cold aura enveloping them both. Their eyes regained clarity.
"Go!" Luo Tian ordered Su Dan, sensing the severity of the situation. He flew toward where he had seen the figures.
Su Dan's face had lost its former composure, following Luo Tian closely, her complexion improving with Long Yuan's cold aura.
Their speed was swift; after an hour, they finally saw the figures Luo Tian had seen.
Two youths stood before them, their faces still youthful, clad in gray robes, walking on the cracked ground.
"Hello!" Their sudden appearance startled the youths, who immediately assumed defensive postures, gazing at Luo Tian and Su Dan.
Their auras were formidable but no match for Luo Tian and Su Dan's strength.
"Saint-level!" Luo Tian's face shifted slightly, noting the youths weren't human but soul entities that had cultivated into this form—similar to魂修 (soul cultivators) from the Nine Domains.
"Who are you?" The youths asked, their voices wary as they sensed the strong danger from Luo Tian and Su Dan.
"How could there be Saint-level individuals?" Luo Tian wondered.
"Come here!" Luo Tian extended his hand, grabbing the two youths and ordering, "Don't resist!"
He immediately initiated a soul search. Even if they resisted, he could do so without harming their souls. Saint-level beings were weak before him.
Moments later, the youths' memories flooded Luo Tian's mind, causing his face to shift.
The Yin-Yang Tribe: the south was Yang, the north Yin. The southern region had heavy Yang energy, while the northern had intense Yin. These youths were from the southern faction.
The south was all males; the north, all females. The two tribes had fought for generations. Women in the south were treated as mere breeding tools, and vice versa. They captured each other's people for slavery to reproduce.
These two youths were Guan Yang and Guan Tai, with the demon sun above being their southern tribe's totem. They worshipped it devoutly.
"Strange tribe!" Luo Tian muttered, releasing the youths and frowning.
"Come on; take me to your tribe!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his tone authoritative.
"Yes! Yes!" The youths nodded quickly, sensing this man was stronger than their tribe's leader.
They didn't dare delay, leading Luo Tian and Su Dan toward their tribe.
After nearly an hour, Su Dan's face turned red again. Though Long Yuan's cold aura suppressed it, she was still heavily affected by the fire toxin. Luo Tian felt some impact but not as severely as Su Dan.
"Master, women here are very uncomfortable because of the demon sun. Those who come here become extremely eager for intimacy!"
"Our captured slaves are very chaste, but the demon sun makes them submit to us for offspring!" Guan Yang spoke respectfully, naturally revealing this wasn't a secret.
"Troublesome!" Luo Tian felt a headache, understanding why Su Dan was so severe.
"What a cursed place!" Su Dan cursed, grabbing Luo Tian's finger, gazing at him before biting her tongue to stay focused.
"Quickly!" Luo Tian didn't hesitate, lifting Su Dan onto his back and grabbing Guan Yang and Guan Tai. He flew toward the tribe's location as per their memories.
The hot body tightly wrapped around Luo Tian, Su Dan exhaled heat, her fragrance making Luo Tian struggle to stay focused.
After half an hour, the temperature slightly dropped, and Luo Tian finally saw the southern tribe's location.
An endless forest revealed a clan of nearly ten thousand people.
Luo Tian descended, landing outside the tribe's gate, immediately drawing attention.
"Guan Yang, Guan Tai! You returned so quickly? And brought someone back—was this your coming-of-age trial?" A gray figure surrounded them.
"Beautiful!"
"Too beautiful!" The crowd's exclamations echoed around Luo Tian, gazing at Su Dan on his back.

Chapter 2153: Suppressing the Fire Toxin
"You two boys are great! You brought such a fine slave!" Gray-robed figures surrounded Luo Tian, their eyes greedy as they stared at Su Dan on his back.
The coming-of-age trial of the southern tribe: upon adulthood, one must leave the tribe to capture northern women for their trial.
Guan Yang and Guan Tai were about to worship the demon sun before encountering Luo Tian.
At this moment, Su Dan's condition was dire; her face flushed, her body writhing on Luo Tian's back, radiating an alluring aura. No man could resist this temptation—especially these men of the tribe.
"Guan Tai, Guan Yang! I'll trade my two slaves for yours!" A big man stepped forward, eyeing Su Dan and licking his lips. He waved his hand, revealing two naked women who clung to him hungrily.
"Two? I'll offer four!" Hearing the big man, another shouted.
"This..." Guan Yang and Guan Tai looked troubled; along the way, they'd realized Luo Tian and Su Dan were different.
"Get lost!" Luo Tian sneered, an invisible wave radiating from him, making the crowd tremble.
"Who are you, kid?" The people noticed Luo Tian, their faces turning serious as they sensed his uniqueness.
"Bang..." As the crowd was stunned, Luo Tian's aura surged, blowing them away.
Luo Tian took a step forward, walking toward Guan Yang and Guan Tai's courtyard under the people's trembling gazes.
"Who is this man?"
"Why can't I resist!" The crowd's faces showed fear, watching Luo Tian leave. They felt like facing a deity in that moment.
Luo Tian became a breeze, instantly entering a dilapidated courtyard and rushing into the room. He waved his hand, creating a barrier to enclose it.
"Little Brother Chen, am I beautiful?" As she entered the room, Su Dan's face was flushed, asking Luo Tian with a voice full of allure.
"Ugh..." Luo Tian took a deep breath, gazing at Su Dan writhing toward him.
At this moment, Su Dan was barely in control, tearing her clothes off as she breathed heavily.
"Forgive me!" Luo Tian grabbed her, and her clothes turned to fragments, revealing her perfect body.
Luo Tian's nose felt a slight heat; his abdomen swelled, his tongue nearly bitten through to stay alert. He stepped toward Su Dan.
"Get lost..." Though Su Dan was dazed, her body moved toward Luo Tian, but she shouted.
"Luo Chen, you bastard..." Su Dan cursed repeatedly, yet her body rubbed against Luo Tian.
"Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed, pinning Su Dan and then throwing silver needles onto his hand.
"Luo Chen, come quickly!" Su Dan roared, her body howling as the fire toxin surged through her mind.
"Buzz..." Luo Tian waved his hand, a silver light flying into Su Dan's forehead.
"It worked!" Luo Tian smiled, then another needle flew toward her abdomen.
"Ah..." A cry echoed; Su Dan's forehead sweat flowed, but the intense pain eased her condition.
"Quickly, another one!" Su Dan roared, sensing the fire toxin gathering at her head's acupoints.
"Good!" Luo Tian nodded, resisting the seductive scene as he threw needles repeatedly.
"Ahh..." Cries echoed in the room, and outside the barrier, many southern tribe members gathered at Guan Yang and Guan Tai's courtyard.
They listened to the cries, their faces understanding.
"This man is really impatient; he started immediately upon arrival!" They murmured.
"But that slave is truly beautiful. If she were mine, I'd do the same!" They stood outside the barrier, discussing.
"I'll see what his strength is!" A youth stepped forward, gazing at the barrier and striking it with a palm.
"Boom..." The youth was only of heavenly sage level; he couldn't break Luo Tian's barrier, being blasted away.
"Wow..."
"The chief was blown away!" The southern tribe members' faces showed surprise.
"Go get my father; I don't believe he's stronger than my father!" The youth's face twisted, shouting to the crowd.
He had heard their discussions and learned of Su Dan's beauty, prompting him to desire her forcibly.
In the southern tribe, the number of slaves indicated status. This youth, as a junior chief, could claim any slave's possession.
Before long, a middle-aged man arrived outside the crowd, his face stern as he gazed at Luo Tian's barrier.
"True Sage Power!" The man's face shifted slightly, surprised to find someone using true sage power.
"Of course, you can't break it; it's a barrier of true sage initial level!" The man scoffed, approaching the barrier.
"Boom..." The man struck the barrier with his palm.
Just as his hand descended, a figure instantly appeared within the barrier and struck it from inside.
"Boom..." A dull sound echoed; two palms collided, and the chief felt as if he had struck a mountain. His face changed, blood spewing as he was blasted away.
"Anyone disturbing me will die!" Luo Tian's cold voice echoed, then he returned to the room.
"Chief was blown away!" Everyone was stunned, watching the bleeding man on the ground. They couldn't believe their strongest chief had lost to this youth.
"How much stronger is he? I felt immense suppression; how did he do it?" The chief stood up, his eyes filled with disbelief.
The crowd no longer dared to touch the barrier, waiting for Luo Tian to emerge.
"One hour... two hours..." Four hours passed, and the cries in the room never ceased.
"Indeed a divine being; four hours without emerging, can his body endure it?" Everyone's faces showed shock as they murmured.
Finally, after half an hour, Luo Tian emerged from the room, drenched in sweat.
"How to suppress the fire toxin?" Luo Tian's face darkened as he asked.
"It can't be suppressed unless you enter the northern female tribe and use Moyang's coldness to release it!" The middle-aged chief replied respectfully.
Luo Tian turned, re-entering the room where Su Dan had regained clarity, wearing one of his outer robes.
"I only gathered the fire toxin into your acupoints; I can't expel it externally. To cure it, I must take you to another place!" Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Su Dan.
Su Dan's face still had a flush; she nodded: "Then take me there. I can't move well now!"
"Forgive me!" Luo Tian sighed, approaching Su Dan and lifting her into his arms. He flew toward the female tribe's direction.
"The female tribe will be in trouble!" Seeing Luo Tian leave, the crowd's faces showed a hint of joy.
As they spoke, Luo Tian's figure vanished from their sight.
Flying for a while, the scenery beneath them faded, and the air's temperature gradually dropped, easing Su Dan's condition.
After two hours of flight through a vast forest, Luo Tian finally arrived at the female tribe's location.
Unlike the male tribe's domain, a black moon hung above it, radiating coldness.
"Strange place!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly but felt relieved as Su Dan's complexion improved.
After another hour of flight, Luo Tian finally sensed human presence—a tribe consisting entirely of women.
Without hesitation, he carried Su Dan toward the tribe, knowing that beyond it lay Moyang's domain, where coldness was intense.
"Stop!" As Luo Tian carried Su Dan and approached the tribe, a series of women's voices echoed in his ears. A pair of black arrows flew toward him.
Numerous gray-robed women blocked Luo Tian's path, their eyes filled with hostility.
"Dare to enter our female tribe!" A woman's voice rang out, stepping forward from the crowd. Her eyes gleamed with desire upon seeing Luo Tian.

Chapter 2154: A Place of Cultivation
"I claim this man; bring him to my residence!" The woman, clad in gray and with a fiery figure, gazed at Luo Tian with greed. Her eyes mirrored the men's gaze toward Su Dan.
"Who are these people?" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness, grabbing the two arrows and tossing them aside. Two streaks of light flew from his hand.
Two cries echoed as the two women who shot at him fell from the sky.
Luo Tian's aura surged, unimpeded as he rushed toward the women blocking his path.
An invisible pressure spread, knocking the women back and sending them flying outward.
"Strong!" The woman who seemed to be the leader's face grew more excited, launching a black hand toward Luo Tian.
"Leave! I don't want to kill!" Luo Tian sneered, his voice calm yet like a divine decree. The leader's hand shattered before him.
Under the women's shock, Luo Tian departed, heading toward the tribe's inner grounds.
"When did the southern tribe produce such a person?" The leader woman trembled, watching Luo Tian leave.
"It's impossible!"
"Let him in; even if he's ironclad, he'll be crushed by Moyang's power. He'll eventually come to us!" The leader woman's face then showed a smile.
The thought of this strong man kneeling before her made her heart race with excitement.
Luo Tian carried Su Dan, flying swiftly. Su Dan smiled, gazing at Luo Tian.
Thinking of the scene in that room, her heart raced uncontrollably. She truly feared this Looping Pool's danger.
She also felt grateful for meeting Luo Tian; if it were any other man, she might have lost herself.
Though losing oneself here didn't mean losing it in reality, the two were essentially the same.
Luo Tian's actions had made Su Dan see through her aversion to men, opening a crack.
She wrapped her arms around his neck, leaning on his chest. A strange feeling of safety enveloped her.
"Too cold!" Luo Tian flew on, exiting the female tribe's domain. The chill began to erode him.
