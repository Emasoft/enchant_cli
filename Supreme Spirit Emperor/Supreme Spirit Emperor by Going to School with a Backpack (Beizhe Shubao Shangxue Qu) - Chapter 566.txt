As the chill seeped into his body, Su Dan’s fire poison gradually dissipated under the influence of the cold energy, restoring her complexion to a normal hue.

Su Dan had improved significantly, but Lu Tian felt increasingly uncomfortable. The cold energy made him uneasy, and a thought began to form in his mind—especially after feeling Su Dan’s presence. That thought grew stronger with each passing moment.

“Damn, this cold poison is just like the fire poison—only it affects men!” Lu Tian suddenly understood, his expression darkening.

“This damn thing wants to kill me!” Lu Tian’s body trembled as he tightened his grip around Su Dan. Seeing that she hadn’t yet left his arms, he gritted his teeth and flew forward again.

Time passed. A quarter of an hour had elapsed, and Lu Tian’s face was slightly flushed—but not with heat. It was the chill that made his skin redden.

“How are you doing? Have you recovered some?” Lu Tian asked Su Dan, gritting his teeth as he gazed at the seductive beauty in his arms, resisting the urge to kiss her.

“I’m not fully recovered yet, but I’ll be soon!” Su Dan rested her cheek against Lu Tian’s chest, feeling his accelerated heartbeat. A sly smile crossed her lips as she replied.

In truth, Su Dan was nearly capable of flying on her own, but she hesitated to leave. She cherished the safety Lu Tian provided and lied to him.

“Damn…” Lu Tian cursed inwardly as eight-colored flames began to swirl within his body, countering the extreme cold.

The fire’s warmth improved Lu Tian’s condition slightly, but his urge remained undiminished. After another half-hour of flight, Lu Tian could no longer resist. One hand involuntarily roamed over Su Dan’s body.

“What are you doing?” Su Dan’s expression shifted slightly, and she immediately broke free from Lu Tian’s embrace. Her gaze turned icy as she stared at him.

But then, she noticed Lu Tian’s red face and bloodshot eyes—his expression was that of a starving wolf.

“You’re healed, so I’m leaving!” Lu Tian panted, forcing himself to suppress the urge to push her down. He turned and fled.

“Little Brother Lu Chen, do you want it?” Su Dan’s voice was teasing as she appeared before him, her eyes filled with flirtation.

“Move aside!” Lu Tian roared, his body’s flames surging as he glared at Su Dan.

Before he could finish speaking, a pair of lips pressed against his—only for an instant.

“Roar…” Lu Tian’s mind erupted with thoughts of Su Dan’s earlier appearance in the room. His restraint finally shattered.

But before he could act, Su Dan vanished before his eyes, a smile on her face.

“Hurry up and try to break through that Black Moon. If my guess is right, the moon must be a prime place for cultivation!” Lu Tian’s voice echoed in Su Dan’s ears as he disappeared.

“Thank you,” Su Dan’s eyes flashed with a glimmer of light, her voice soft as she watched Lu Tian vanish. Her lips curled slightly—she had no intention of following his advice. She couldn’t let Lu Tian go mad and encounter the women of the female tribe.

Lu Tian flew relentlessly, free from Su Dan’s temptation and aided by his swirling eight-colored flames. He wasn’t as vulnerable as Su Dan.

He flew with all his might, faster than before. In one hour, he reached the sky above the female tribe’s domain.

The moment he appeared, the middle-aged leader of the female tribe blocked his path, her aura radiating a True Immortal Intermediate level.

“Back already?” The female tribe leader smiled, gazing at Lu Tian before extending her hand to grab him.

“Get out of my way!” Lu Tian roared, showing no mercy as he slapped his hand forward to crush her.

“Boom…” A massive black hand descended, radiating overwhelming power as it crushed the middle-aged woman.

Her face contorted in shock—she hadn’t expected Lu Tian, infected by the Black Moon’s power, to still possess such strength. Especially the aura of a Soul-Subduing Master, which she couldn’t withstand. She had no will to fight and was instantly crushed by Lu Tian’s hand.

“Boom…” Her body crashed into the ground like a meteor.

Lu Tian didn’t check if she was dead, instead flying out of the female tribe’s domain.

“Damn it!” Lu Tian panted heavily, cursing repeatedly as he restrained the urge to return and slaughter everyone. He flew toward the southern tribe instead.

“What a monster is this?” The middle-aged woman coughed blood, standing up as her subordinates stared in disbelief. Never before had they seen their leader so battered.

“Who dared to think of her? You must be desperate for death!” As the group was stunned, Su Dan descended from the sky, appearing above the female tribe. She pointed her finger, and a massive black butterfly slowly flew toward the middle-aged leader.

…

An hour had passed for Lu Tian, who felt it had lasted forever. Yet he still managed to resist and reach the southern tribe’s sky.

“Back so soon?” The people of the southern tribe stared in shock at Lu Tian’s figure streaking across the horizon.

“His condition is off—he must have been infected by the Black Moon’s power!” The middle-aged leader of the southern tribe immediately noticed, her eyes gleaming with excitement.

“This is the best opportunity to kill him!” As the leader, she had made her decision. Lu Tian’s return threatened her position; she certainly didn’t want him to live.

“Kill!” The middle-aged man leapt into the air, his aura surging as he held a black staff. The staff was rough and crude, clearly carved from the trunk of a tree.

“Buzz…” The black staff radiated overwhelming power in the hands of the True Immortal Intermediate-level leader, smashing toward Lu Tian.

“Die!” Lu Tian’s eyes turned red as he summoned his sword, Longyuan, and slashed at the black staff.

A flash of divine light—Longyuan severed the black staff and its wielder in one strike.

“One move, one kill! We’ve lost our chieftain!” The tribe’s people were stunned, their eyes turning toward Lu Tian as he flew away.

“Father…” The young chieftain roared, but Lu Tian ignored him. His priority was to eliminate the damned cold energy within his body.

Another hour passed, and Lu Tian finally returned to the cracked earth. The icy power in his body gradually faded.

“Damn it, this is too tormenting! I’ve gone through this twice—this will end up breaking me!” Lu Tian cursed inwardly.

He sat cross-legged on the scorching earth, remaining still for an hour until the cold energy vanished.

“Huff…”

“Next, I’ll check the Black Sun,” Lu Tian gazed at the black sun above him, murmuring to himself.

Chapter 2155: Again, a Human-Shaped Flame

On the cracked earth, the black sun radiated overwhelming power, hovering in the sky. Lu Tian stood there, his eyes filled with contemplation.

After a moment of thought, he leapt into the air toward the black sun, quickly leaving the ground behind.

The Black Moon and Black Sun had existed long before the southern and northern tribes appeared. Though Lu Tian had been infected by the Black Moon’s power, he seemed to grasp something about this world.

Here, the Black Moon and Black Sun appeared as opposing forces—one representing ultimate yang for men, the other ultimate yin for women. They seemed to form a strange opposition, creating an innate formation.

These two were like the core points of the formation—each place must be a prime location. Lu Tian even suspected that this world’s soul essence was formed due to the relationship between the Black Moon and Black Sun.

Lu Tian’s distance from the ground increased rapidly, so fast that he was almost invisible to the naked eye.

Thousand zhang… ten thousand zhang… a hundred thousand zhang…

Lu Tian’s speed was astonishing, quickly pushing through the immense pressure to reach a hundred thousand zhang away from the Black Sun. The intense heat made his brows furrow slightly.

“What’s this temperature coming from?” Lu Tian muttered, wary of the heat but still flying toward the massive Black Sun.

Time passed slowly. After another hour, Lu Tian was only ten thousand zhang away from the scorching Black Sun.

The full appearance of the Black Sun was now visible to Lu Tian.

Entirely black, it resembled a round charcoal block, burning with dark flames that pierced through vast stretches of void. This was the image seen by the southern tribe, as they were too far to see the Black Sun’s true form.

At this moment, Lu Tian stood outside the burned void, about ten thousand zhang away from the massive Black Sun.

But this distance felt like an abyss—first, the burned void with its howling winds; then the black flames and the Black Sun itself, which gave Lu Tian a sense of unease. He felt the Black Sun must have a reason for its existence.

Yet, Lu Tian could clearly sense an immense pulling force from the Black Sun, with waves of ghostly qi constantly flowing toward it like fuel for the black flames.

This was definitely a prime location. The world’s soul essence must be due to the ghostly qi drawn toward this Black Sun.

Lu Tian muttered, quickly making a decision. The three challenges before him would be difficult for others, but Lu Tian had his powerful body and the eight-colored flames. He wasn’t afraid of the intense heat, but what troubled him most was the danger on the Black Sun.

At the same time, Su Dan faced a similar situation. She gazed at the black moon, her eyes filled with contemplation before biting her lip and summoning two black wings like a butterfly, flying toward the black moon.

“Go!” Lu Tian took a step forward, rushing into the void. As he appeared, waves of chaotic void currents swept over him, scraping his face painfully.

Besides avoiding major void currents, Lu Tian didn’t waste much time and quickly arrived at the edge of the black fire.

The eight-colored flames surrounded Lu Tian’s body as he leapt into the overwhelming sea of fire.

“Hmm?” Upon entering the fiery chaos, Lu Tian’s expression shifted slightly—because under the terrifying heat of the black flames, his eight-colored flames seemed to weaken slightly.

“What’s going on?” Lu Tian immediately communicated with Xiao Qi, now referred to as Xiao Ba. Though he still called it Xiao Qi, the response came instantly.

“This flame is no weaker than yours?” A moment later, Xiao Qi replied.

“How is that possible?” Lu Tian was stunned. He hadn’t encountered a flame that made Xiao Qi wary in a long time—this situation had only occurred once before, when the Long Que’s fire lotus was unleashed.

“Perhaps there is a great opportunity!” Lu Tian’s eyes gleamed with excitement as he stepped forward, heading deeper into the fire. This black flame resembled the endless fire sea of the Fire Domain but was far hotter than those flames.

With the eight-colored flames surrounding him, Lu Tian finally reached the massive Black Sun. His feet touched it, and waves of ghostly qi rose from beneath the Black Sun—yet they were instantly ignited by the black qi, turning into flames and vanishing from Lu Tian’s sight.

“Such concentrated ghostly qi!” Lu Tian observed the Black Sun beneath him, feeling its overwhelming density. It was the most intense he had ever encountered.

“This flame is annoying, but it won’t interfere with my absorption of the ghostly qi! We’ll keep to ourselves!” Lu Tian spoke softly, as if reassuring himself. He sat cross-legged on the Black Sun and began absorbing its surging ghostly qi.

At the same time, Su Dan sat cross-legged on the Black Moon and started her cultivation.

As both of them cultivated, all the disciples who had entered the Reincarnation Pool were searching for suitable places to train.

Wang Gang found a black mountain and sat cross-legged, while Mo Cheng found a water pool and immersed himself in it.

“What about this forest? Though not a prime location, it should allow us to cultivate for two or three years and reach the True Immortal Intermediate level!” Two young men stood in a peach forest, their eyes filled with excitement.

A figure walked along a mountain peak, smiling as he passed the two young men.

“Who are you?” The two young men immediately became alert, their eyes cautious as they looked at the stranger. They had found this place after struggling and even lost it before.

“Nothing, just passing through. Continue your cultivation!” The young man wore a black robe, his face handsome, and he carried a black spear on his back—Yang Huan Yu.

Though Yang Huan Yu was smiling and spoke politely, the two young men felt an inexplicable unease. His eyes looked like a hunter watching prey.

What eased their minds was that Yang Huan Yu didn’t attack them but walked away.

“Crazy, let’s cultivate here and improve our strength!” The two young men whispered to each other before sitting cross-legged.

“Fatten them up, and they’ll be delicious when I kill them!” Yang Huan Yu muttered quietly as he walked through the Reincarnation World, observing disciple after disciple. He didn’t attack but kept a smile on his face as he watched the disciples of the Turn-Transformation Hall.

Time passed. Half a year had gone by, and almost all disciples of the Turn-Transformation Hall found places to cultivate. Though some were better than others, even just cultivating here could elevate their strength significantly due to the time flow.

During these six months, Lu Tian remained seated on the Black Sun, and some disciples of the Turn-Transformation Hall had seen him but didn’t disturb him. They were afraid to compete with Lu Tian, and the same went for Su Dan.

Inside the Black Sun, Lu Tian sat cross-legged, his body wrapped in black ghostly qi. Waves of ghostly qi continuously entered his body.

“Great!” Lu Tian opened his eyes, feeling that his cultivation had grown rapidly over these six months. If he could fully refine the entire Black Sun, he was confident he could reach True Immortal Late Period and even attempt to break through to the Tremendous Immortal Peak!

“Roar…” But as Lu Tian absorbed more ghostly qi, a series of roars echoed in his ears.

The black flames violently surged, as if angry at Lu Tian’s absorption. A series of black fire dragons continuously rushed toward him.

“What does this mean?” Lu Tian’s expression shifted slightly as he stood up, gazing at the fire dragons rushing toward him.

“Boom…” Lu Tian punched forward, his fist wrapped in eight-colored flames, striking the black fire dragons.

Boom Boom Boom…

Each black fire dragon was instantly shattered by Lu Tian, turning into waves of fire that spread in all directions.

“Buzz…” As the fire waves dispersed, another wave of energy surged, and the massive Black Sun trembled again. The fiery sea roared.

The black flames engulfed heaven and earth, forming a massive black fire figure that stood before Lu Tian.

“Human-shaped flame!” Lu Tian’s expression shifted slightly, his voice filled with surprise.

Lu Tian rarely showed such an expression; he was truly stunned by the sight of this flame figure. Besides Xiao Qi, Lu Tian had never seen a human-shaped flame before.

He knew how Xiao Qi was formed—created by the Fire Lord. But this human-shaped flame clearly hadn’t developed high intelligence, yet it was self-formed.

At that moment, Lu Tian fully understood why Xiao Qi had been wary—because of the existence of this human-shaped flame.

“Opportunity!” Lu Tian’s eyes sparkled as he gazed at the black flames, instantly thinking this might be his opportunity. If Xiao Qi devoured it, perhaps Xiao Qi would undergo a terrifying evolution.

“Boom Boom…” As Lu Tian was stunned, a massive black hand, radiating terrifying heat, slammed down toward him.

“Kill…” Lu Tian grabbed Longyuan and leapt into the air, his red sword slicing toward the black hand.

In an instant, the fiery red sword collided with the hand, and Lu Tian was pushed back step by step. With each step, waves of black qi rose from beneath his feet.

Chapter 2156: The Time to Hunt Has Come

On the Black Sun, two figures clashed repeatedly, their thunderous collisions echoing from the sky. The southern tribe’s people looked up in awe at the Black Sun, knowing this fierce fluctuation came from their ancestral deity.

“Is the sky about to collapse?” People watched the Black Sun in the sky, aware that this wild fluctuation came from their long-revered deity.

“Boom…” The collision sound echoed, and Lu Tian retreated, his face showing fatigue as he gazed at the human-shaped flame approaching him again.

After clashing for a quarter of an hour, this human-shaped flame had taken humanoid form but attacked with singular simplicity—no understanding of martial arts.

Yet this single attack was enough to trouble Lu Tian. Unlike humans, who had levels to estimate strength, this flame left Lu Tian unsure of its true power.

Moreover, the terrifying temperature from the black fire figure made it difficult for Lu Tian to endure, even with Xiao Qi’s protection.

“Gotta force you to fight!” Lu Tian cursed, his hands moving as a gray soul knife flew from his forehead toward the fire figure.

The gray soul knife pierced through the black flames, slicing into the fire figure’s body. A series of roars echoed across the Black Sun.

The fire figure had a body made of flames, no flesh or blood—so it had no weaknesses. Unlike Xiao Qi, who was closely tied to Lu Tian and would weaken if he died, this human-shaped flame was hard to subdue. Especially after it had formed and gained intelligence, it was no different from a normal human.

But who understood human-shaped flames best? Besides the Fire Lord, it was Lu Tian. He knew that before a human-shaped flame fully formed, its greatest weakness was the soul.

This human-shaped flame’s soul hadn’t completely solidified—its soul was definitely its weakest point. If he could sever the soul, it would be much easier afterward!

“Roar…” Lu Tian’s soul was powerful. Though the terrifying temperature had weakened its power slightly, it still caused the human-shaped flame to let out a mournful cry as it pierced into its body.

“Crash…” The fire sea surged, and the black figure opened its mouth, spewing a massive wave of black flames toward Lu Tian.

Lu Tian moved his hands, and Longyuan’s sword radiated brilliant light as it sliced through the fire wave. The overwhelming sword light instantly split the incoming fire wave in two.

But Lu Tian’s body was still hit by the weakened flames, sending him flying backward.

“Again!” Lu Tian roared, and the gray soul knife erupted again. This time, its power was stronger. Lu Tian directly unleashed a fifth of his soul to unleash an immense pressure.

“Buzz…” The gray light flashed again, and the massive soul knife, carrying Lu Tian’s killing intent, sliced toward the black fire figure.

“Roar…” This time, a mournful cry echoed across the Black Sun, filled with extreme pain.

“Boom…” The black figure collapsed in a burst of flames, scattering into countless fire fragments before Lu Tian.

“Caw caw…” The black flames instantly transformed into dozens of black crows, flying toward Lu Tian.

“Xiao Qi, swallow it!” Lu Tian pressed his hand to his forehead, the eight-colored flame mark glowing. Xiao Qi appeared beside him.

The small figure looked at the countless fire crows, and with a single inhale, an invisible suction force pulled in many of the fire crows into its mouth. Xiao Qi’s face showed excitement.

Seeing Xiao Qi start to devour the fire crows, Lu Tian smiled slightly, watching as Xiao Qi’s head grew more hair.

The fire crows flew wildly, instantly breaking apart and reforming into a fiery sea that surged toward Lu Tian. But the flames were directly swallowed by Xiao Qi, making Lu Tian smile again.

“Go!” Lu Tian gently patted Xiao Qi’s head, his eyes filled with admiration.

Lu Tian didn’t care how Xiao Qi devoured the flames but sat cross-legged again on the Black Sun, continuing to absorb its swirling ghostly qi.

Xiao Qi transformed into a cheerful child, running across the vast Black Sun, capturing black flames everywhere.

After defeating the black flame, Lu Tian felt much more at ease and began to rapidly increase his cultivation.

Another year passed, and Xiao Qi finally devoured all the black flames of the Black Sun. As expected, Xiao Qi’s hair grew another color, now nine colors in total.

Xiao Qi’s height also increased significantly, reaching Lu Tian’s shoulder level. His childishness had faded somewhat.

During this year, Lu Tian’s cultivation also grew significantly. The Black Sun dimmed slightly, its surface turning from black to a grayish hue.

Cultivation was monotonous, but Lu Tian cherished this rare opportunity, sitting cross-legged every day.

One day, Yang Huan Yu’s figure finally reached the area where Lu Tian was. He looked up at the Black Sun, his eyes deep.

“Not bad, there’s a big one here!” Yang Huan Yu muttered quietly, gazing at the Black Sun in the sky as if he could see Lu Tian sitting on it.

“Hmm?” As Yang Huan Yu’s gaze fell upon the Black Sun, Lu Tian’s body trembled slightly as if sensing it. He opened his eyes, his gaze filled with a deep purple hue, looking down at the ground.

“It’s him!” The two of them locked eyes. Lu Tian’s eyes widened in disbelief.

“How could he find me?” Yang Huan Yu smiled, looking at Lu Tian and waving his hand.

“How did he end up here?” Lu Tian’s mind was in turmoil, his shock immense. Others didn’t recognize Yang Huan Yu, but Lu Tian could never mistake him.

Yet Yang Huan Yu only looked at Lu Tian for a moment before walking away, as if he didn’t want to attack him.

Lu Tian also didn’t move but sat cross-legged again on the Black Sun, his mind filled with questions.

“He’s also a True Immortal Intermediate! Where did he find the ultimate immortal soul? How did he enter the Reincarnation Pool?” These questions filled Lu Tian’s mind, and a bad premonition arose—Yang Huan Yu’s appearance might make the Reincarnation Pool extremely dangerous.

With this thought, Lu Tian accelerated his absorption of the Black Sun’s ghostly qi. He wasn’t sure if he could defeat a True Immortal Intermediate, but Yang Huan Yu was his top rival—far stronger than the Eight Heavenly Kings.

One year… two years…

Time passed quickly, and only one year remained until the Reincarnation Pool’s end.

In this year, all disciples of the Turn-Transformation Hall underwent significant changes. Everyone was on the verge of breaking through.

“Everyone’s fattened up! The hunting time has come!” Yang Huan Yu smiled, stepping toward a small mountain in his view.

Two young men sat cross-legged on the mountain, slowly opening their eyes with excitement.

“Half a year more, and I’ll break through to True Immortal Intermediate!” They both spoke simultaneously, feeling their cultivation.

“This Reincarnation Pool was worth our struggle to enter!” They sighed in admiration, their chosen place not the best but equivalent to the lower tiers of the Turn-Transformation Hall.

“Hard work for you!” As they were excited to continue meditating, Yang Huan Yu appeared like a ghost behind them.

A black Yanming spear transformed into a dark line, piercing through one young man’s chest. The youth’s life force vanished quickly, his eyes still filled with excitement from the breakthrough—too stunned to react.

“Ugh…”

The other young man barely had time to resist before Yang Huan Yu grabbed his neck, silencing him.

“Crack…” A crisp sound echoed as the youth’s neck was snapped, his life force vanishing.

Yang Huan Yu smiled and opened his mouth, instantly sucking the two youths’ bodies dry. Waves of black qi entered his mouth. Even more terrifying was that their souls were directly absorbed by the Yanming spear.

Soul destruction in this Reincarnation Pool meant complete death.

“What happened?”

“Why are two disciples’ life forces gone!” A senior master, who had been watching the Reincarnation Pool from outside, looked in disbelief. He immediately sent a mental message to the eight deputy hall masters.

At that moment, the gray water in the Reincarnation Pool was nearly gone. In one more day, these people would awaken—but at this critical moment, the two disciples’ bodies were still intact, but their souls had vanished.

“Nothing’s wrong; it might be an accident. Sometimes people die in the Reincarnation Pool!” The eight deputy hall masters said with a helpless expression.

Chapter 2157: Taking the Blame

Above the Turn-Transformation Hall, a massive tortoise pool floated there. Eight elders gazed at the two youths whose souls had vanished.

Although the Reincarnation Pool wasn’t dangerous, every opening would result in some disciples dying. The eight deputy hall masters weren’t too concerned.

But soon after, three more youths’ life forces vanished completely, their souls disappearing from their bodies. This made the eight deputy hall masters slightly uneasy.

“Previously, there were deaths too, but never so fast!” Du Jianxing frowned slightly, his eyes filled with confusion.

“Sometimes up to ten people die; this is only five—nothing too bad,” Yu Tian said with a dismissive expression. If people could die in such a safe place as the Reincarnation Pool, it showed their luck and strength were poor.

“Another two!” But as Yu Tian’s words finished, a senior master cried out in alarm, seeing two disciples without life forces.

“What’s going on?” Du Jianxing and the others felt something was off, their eyes fixed on the massive Reincarnation Pool.

Within dozens of breaths, another disciple’s life force vanished. Then, within an hour, over a hundred people died!

“Over a hundred dead—what happened in the Reincarnation Pool?” The eight deputy hall masters were furious.

But they dared not forcibly pull the disciples out of the Reincarnation Pool, as doing so would cause great harm to them—possibly even soul destruction.

“Even if they die in the Reincarnation Pool, they won’t truly die unless their souls are destroyed!”

“Who has such power to destroy a soul?” One elder spoke, his eyes filled with confusion.

But this elder’s words directed people’s attention to Lu Tian. They clearly remembered that Lu Tian had killed Duan Boyang before and extracted his soul, destroying it completely.

“It must be him! The only ones with the power to kill so many disciples are the Eight Heavenly Kings and Lu Chen. Among them, only Lu Chen can extract souls and destroy them!” Yu Tian shouted loudly, his voice filled with anger.

“Another three dead!” As the group discussed, another senior master cried out in alarm, his voice filled with shock.

“I suggest we forcibly extract this Lu Chen to prevent other disciples from being killed!” Yu Tian spoke, his voice cold.

“But why? He’s already a prince; why kill these people?” Du Jianxing responded.

“Du elder, he’s your disciple, but you can’t protect him like this. I’ve already sent a mental message to the hall master; he has supreme power and will extract him!” Yu Tian coldly replied.

“Fine, we’ll wait for the hall master’s decision!” Du Jianxing sneered; he didn’t believe Lu Tian would do this, even if he killed people, there must be a reason.

“Hall master, what are you doing? Why haven’t you appeared?” The group waited a while but didn’t see the Black and White Reapers.

Instead, they saw a figure—Fu Xingxuan, her eyes filled with a smile, appearing in their view.

“This isn’t Lu Chen’s doing!” Fu Xingxuan spoke softly, gazing at the eight hall masters.

“Holy Lady, you can’t decide this. We have our own decision!” Yu Tian’s face showed disdain. In his view, the Holy Lady was just a figurehead—only because she had merged with the mother of the Night-blooming Cereus did she hold this position. Originally, she was just a dying person.

“Reaper Hall Master sent me to tell you all: it’s not Lu Chen who did this. So, everyone mustn’t act!” Fu Xingxuan spoke softly, gazing at the group.

“Then we’ll just watch these disciples die?”

“If this continues, thousands of disciples might be wiped out!” Yu Tian roared, but another few disciples died immediately.

“Then we’ll wait; the hall master hasn’t said anything!” Fu Xingxuan spoke, saying “hall master” repeatedly and silencing Yu Tian.

…

In the Reincarnation World, Yang Huan Yu continued to kill, but only those with weak strength. His speed wasn’t fast, but after killing each person, their cultivation was directly absorbed by him, enhancing his own.

From weak to strong, Yang Huan Yu’s cultivation rapidly increased. After each kill, the person was immediately turned into a dry corpse and followed Yang Huan Yu as part of his army of dry corpses.

Others didn’t know that this “killing god” had started hunting them, and everyone was excitedly improving.

For the past nine years, Yang Huan Yu had traversed the Reincarnation World to understand these Turn-Transformation retreats, then killed them one by one.

“After absorbing the disciples in this Reincarnation Pool, I should reach True Immortal Peak!” Yang Huan Yu smiled as he led his army of dry corpses toward the next location.

…

On the Black Sun, Lu Tian sat cross-legged, his body’s aura constantly rising as if approaching a critical point.

“Boom…” Suddenly, the massive Black Sun beneath Lu Tian erupted, shattering into pieces and dust swirling around him.

The sky darkened immediately; the people of the southern tribe were shocked, their eyes turning toward the heavens before crying out in alarm.
