“Haha, fighting this little brat isn’t bad!” Yao Chen’s eyes gleamed with excitement; he hadn’t expected this day to come. In an instant, Yao Chen moved like lightning, his golden staff descending with overwhelming force. Luo Tian’s face shifted slightly as he raised his blood sword to meet the staff.

“Crack…” Both Luo Tian and Yao Chen retreated simultaneously. Luo Tian’s expression grew solemn; he could feel Yao Chen’s formidable strength.

“Roar…” A thunderous dragon’s cry echoed. A golden dragon’s shadow surged forth, encircling Luo Tian and wrapping around him.

“Big brother, I’m sorry, but I must take you back!” Chen Zhanbiao shouted, his hands now gripping a green hammer as he charged at Luo Tian.

“Break!” Luo Tian’s blood surged, sensing the formidable strength of Long Jie and the others. He felt no inferiority to other sects’ saint princes, his battle spirit soaring.

…The golden dragon was shattered by Luo Tian. Chen Zhanbiao’s green hammer struck Luo Tian, causing him to recoil slightly. He raised his blood sword in defense.

…The green hammer collided with the back of the blood sword, which struck Luo Tian’s chest.

“Pfth…” Luo Tian spat blood, his body flying backward. His eyes widened in shock at Chen Zhanbiao; he had never encountered such immense strength before.

“Why are they fighting? They know each other, why fight?” Jiang Chen and Ke Duanshan stared in disbelief. Five people suddenly fighting—what was the reason?

“Saint Prince is in danger! They are four Immortal Kings at the initial stage!” Wang Gang spoke, his eyes filled with concern.

“Dangerous, but we cannot help. If we do, Jiang Chen and Ke Duanshan will also fight. We are no match for them!” Wu Mian spoke darkly; he hadn’t expected the enemy to send four Immortal Kings at the initial stage.

“Retreat! Wait for reinforcements before attacking!” Wu Mian declared. If they truly attacked, four Immortal Kings at the initial stage would be difficult to handle; a direct assault would cost too much.

“Saint Prince, retreat! Let us withdraw!” Wu Mian’s voice echoed through the heavens, causing Luo Tian to tremble slightly.

“Retreat!” Luo Tian had no choice but to obey the orders, his body darting toward Hell.

But escaping was not so easy. A golden staff blocked Luo Tian’s path, forcing him to halt.

“Boom…” Another thunderous sound sent Luo Tian reeling, his face pale. The golden dragon coiled again, wrapping around Luo Tian with a sealing force that sent him plummeting from the sky.

“Haha, Luo Tian, your strength has declined so much!” Yao Chen laughed. Long Jie and the others also smiled; after all, Luo Tian was still alive—this was the happiest moment.

Chapter 2522: Retreat()

“Trying to escape? Not so easy!” Luo Tian muttered internally. His cultivation surged wildly, countering the sealing force while his arms strained to break free from the golden dragon.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian broke free, Run Hongyu finally struck. A hundred and eight silver glints instantly appeared before Luo Tian, sending a chill through him.

“Ugh…” A tingling sensation spread across Luo Tian’s body. He felt his entire being shudder, losing control and plummeting from the sky.

“Big brother, you should just come back with us. Let’s find a way to restore your memories!” Chen Zhanbiao laughed, raising his arms to catch Luo Tian.

One thousand zhang… five hundred zhang… In the blink of an eye, Luo Tian drew closer to Chen Zhanbiao. He was about to be caught.

“Dreaming!” Luo Tian coldly spoke, his body emitting a series of thunderous roars.

“Pfth pfth pfth…” Luo Tian’s body released a violent aura. The silver needles embedded in his body burst free.

“Boom boom boom…” At the same time, Luo Tian’s body exploded in size, a burst of explosive power radiating from him. The golden dragon surrounding him also grew with his body.

“Damn, Luo Tian truly isn’t easy to catch!” Run Hongyu extended his hand, drawing the silver glints back into his palm.

“Harder to catch is better. I didn’t finish yet!” Yao Chen’s eyes flashed with golden light, his body expanding into a thousand-zhang-tall giant ape. His staff also grew in size.

“Boom…” The golden dragon finally could not withstand the pressure, shattering before Luo Tian and freeing him.

“Furious Divine Beast’s Step Through the Heavens!” Luo Tian seized the opportunity, his massive foot sweeping forward to stomp at Chen Zhanbiao who stood waiting.

Chen Zhanbiao had no time to react, and Luo Tian’s thick foot landed squarely on the ground, shaking the earth.

“Saint Prince is so strong!” Wang Gang and Wu Mian, preparing to retreat, stared in awe at Luo Tian’s overwhelming aura.

“Take my staff!” The giant ape roared, its simple strike radiating destruction. Luo Tian’s face darkened as he raised his blood sword to meet the staff.

“Crack…” Thunder echoed through the heavens. Everyone felt their heads throb, and Luo Tian’s massive body sank slightly.

“Again!” Yao Chen laughed, his entire being radiating excitement. His golden staff descended again.

“Ahh…” As Luo Tian prepared to block Yao Chen’s attack, a loud roar erupted beneath him. Luo Tian’s massive body trembled as his foot sent out crackling sounds, and the earth began to fracture.

In shock, Luo Tian saw a tall figure lifting his feet, supporting Luo Tian’s legs with both hands.

“Big brother, are you really trying to stomp me to death?” Chen Zhanbiao shouted, his arms straining with effort. His voice carried a hint of委屈.

“Not bad at all, this black tower’s flesh body is really变态!” People gasped as Chen Zhanbiao emerged from under Luo Tian’s feet.

As soon as Chen Zhanbiao appeared, another thunderous collision echoed. Luo Tian’s massive body retreated, and the giant ape Yao Chen also took a few steps back.

“Add me!” Chen Zhanbiao roared, his body continuing to grow. He and Yao Chen formed a front and back block against Luo Tian.

“Thorny!” Luo Tian’s lips twitched as he wiped blood from his mouth. He had not faced such a formidable opponent in a long time.

Collisions echoed continuously as Luo Tian wielded his blood sword, striking fiercely against Yao Chen and Chen Zhanbiao.

“Too变态! These three’s flesh bodies are all at their peak. Their combat power is too strong; even I dare not get close!”

“Moreover, their techniques are also incredibly powerful!” Jiang Chen marveled at the battle.

“Saint Prince, fight on!” Hell’s ghost cultivators cheered Luo Tian as he single-handedly fought four Immortal Kings at the initial stage, their blood boiling with excitement.

“Furious Divine Beast’s Second Step Shattering Stars!” Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao struck simultaneously. Their massive feet collided, sending both reeling.

“You actually know it!” Luo Tian was shocked, seeing Chen Zhanbiao smiling foolishly. He hadn’t expected him to know the “Seven Steps of the Divine Beast.”

“I’m the son of a divine beast. This technique was created by my father!” Chen Zhanbiao grinned foolishly.

“Again!” Luo Tian frowned slightly. Now he finally believed that he was very familiar with these people, not just their techniques but also how they could anticipate his moves and block them.

Luo Tian took a step forward, instantly appearing before Chen Zhanbiao. Seven shadow fists converged, striking toward Chen Zhanbiao.

Chen Zhanbiao grinned foolishly and struck back with a single fist, but it contained an immense power—nine shadow fists.

“Crack…” The sound of breaking echoed. Luo Tian’s body kept retreating, his eyes filled with disbelief.

“This is my master’s ‘Wild Wind’!” Chen Zhanbiao shouted, his eyes gleaming with pride.

“I can’t fight anymore!” Luo Tian finally felt he couldn’t continue. He activated the Hades Step, darting toward Hell.

“Luo Tian, your speed has increased again. But you still can’t escape so easily!” Run Hongyu transformed into a blood light, appearing in Luo Tian’s path.

“Brother, come back with us. Once you regain your memories, you’ll be fine!” Long Jie spoke. From the start of the battle, the four had formed a surrounding formation, determined to bring Luo Tian back. They didn’t trust anyone else with him.

“I want to leave, no one can stop me!” Luo Tian activated the Hades Step, instantly appearing before Run Hongyu. He struck with a fist, but this time six whirlpools appeared on his fist, striking toward Run Hongyu.

“This!” Run Hongyu’s face changed. He felt a sense of danger from Luo Tian’s overwhelming fist.

“Sixfold轮回!” A cold voice echoed in Run Hongyu’s ears. The whirlpools emitted roaring sounds.

One fist struck, the heavens and earth shattered. Black fists directly hit Run Hongyu’s body. Run Hongyu was like a kite with broken strings, spitting blood wildly. His chest had caved in.

“I said I want to leave; no one can stop me!” Luo Tian activated the Hades Step, darting toward Hell.

“Damn it!” Long Jie and Yao Chen’s faces shifted slightly. That punch was too strong; even they would have been beaten up. Run Hongyu’s flesh body was still one level below theirs.

“Don’t chase! His speed is too fast for you to catch!” Run Hongyu spat blood, his body glowing with green light. His caved chest began to recover, but his face was pale.

“What do we do?” Yao Chen watched Luo Tian leave and return to Hell’s ranks, greeted by the cheers of Hell’s people.

“Saint Prince is mighty! Fighting four alone and still managing to wound one while escaping unscathed!” Hell’s people shouted, retreating into the distance.

The people of Tianhun City did not rush out; both sides were wary of each other, hesitant to attack rashly.

“Lord, let’s charge out! We have some advantage now!” Yao Zhengqing shouted excitedly. This was his chance to make a name for himself.

“Get out of here! Who asked you to speak!”

“You want to chase? Go ahead!” Jiang Chen coldly spoke, looking at Yao Zhengqing. Yao Zhengqing trembled slightly.

At the same time, Long Jie and the others returned to Tianhun City. Jiang Chen wore a smile.

“Indeed, the strength of Tianyuan Sect is amazing. Once reinforcements arrive, we can strike back at Bontian City!” Jiang Chen spoke. They had everything but people. If they attacked now, the four Immortal Kings could definitely retake Kamen, but with insufficient manpower, they couldn’t handle everything. Moreover, he wasn’t sure about Long Jie’s attitude.

“Four of you have worked hard. Please rest!” Jiang Chen addressed Long Jie and the others.

Long Jie nodded, returning with Yao Chen to their rest area. As soon as they entered, their faces darkened.

“Capturing Luo Tian is too hard. Unless an Immortal King at the late stage intervenes!”

“Earlier was the best chance to catch Luo Tian. Hell will surely send more reinforcements, making it even harder!” Run Hongyu spoke with a pale face. He could feel Luo Tian had held back; otherwise, he wouldn’t have just been wounded.

“What do we do? Do we really need to wait for our people to arrive and attack Kamen, fighting against the brother’s forces?” Long Jie frowned. Luo Tian had lost his memory, but they hadn’t. They couldn’t fight against Luo Tian and let the Tianyuan Sect’s people die at his hands.

“He lost his memory, but he can be saved! He held back earlier, whether for whatever reason, he definitely didn’t want to kill us. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have just been wounded!” Run Hongyu’s eyes showed contemplation.

“Find people. Also, let Diao Dezhu connect with Bontian Mountain and see if there’s any way. After all, Bontian Mountain has deep resources!” Run Hongyu kept thinking and finally spoke.

“No matter what, we must get Luo Tian to regain his memory first. Once he does, everything will be easy!” Run Hongyu stood up slowly and decided to personally visit Tianyuan Sect.

Chapter 2523: Tianyuan Sect()

The war spread, and the Eight Ghost Gates were all lost. Unlike Kamen, other gates had already advanced ten thousand miles into Hell, causing great excitement in Hell.

Unlike the joy of Hell, the people of the Immortal realm were heavy-hearted, especially the sects in Central Three Heavens. They all felt vulnerable but knew it was a matter of survival, rushing to support each gate.

In Tianhun City, Jiang Chen and others sat there, looking at Long Jie and Chen Zhanbiao.

“Long Elder, how long until the reinforcements from Tianyuan Sect arrive? It’s already been a day!” Jiang Chen asked. The reinforcements from Tianyuan Sect were his last hope.

“This, it should be coming soon. I just contacted them yesterday; they’re about two or three days away, but the road was delayed!” Long Jie replied, his expression serious.

“That’s good. That’s good!” Jiang Chen looked at Long Jie, unsure what he was thinking. He also wondered why they had suddenly fought Luo Tian on the battlefield.

Jiang Chen naturally suspected, but he had no other options. Bontian Mountain hadn’t sent any news either.

“Two or three days, it should be enough!” Jiang Chen muttered quietly. He was really worried about Hell’s reinforcements arriving and attacking Tianhun City again; then Tianhun would truly be defenseless.

Two days later…

“Long Elder, the reinforcements should have arrived by now!” In the hall, Jiang Chen asked Long Jie again.

“Alas, Lord Jiang, I’m sorry. Our people from Tianyuan Sect are coming for the first time to Hell’s Ghost Gates, and they got lost on the way. That’s why it took two days!” Long Jie replied, leaving Jiang Chen speechless.

“Okay…” Jiang Chen was angry but didn’t act out. After all, he still relied on Long Jie.

…On the other side, in Bontian City, Wu Mian and others sat in the hall, waiting for Hell’s reinforcements. After all, they had so many Immortal Kings now; they could only wait for Hell’s Immortal Kings to arrive.

“Saint Prince, what are those four people to you? You really don’t remember?” Wu Mian asked, looking at Luo Tian. He was also worried; if Luo Tian suddenly remembered and returned to the Immortal realm, it would be a major blow to their morale.

“I really don’t remember. According to the Sect Leader, it’s a miracle I survived!” Luo Tian shook his head gently.

“Haha, everyone, you waited long! We’re late!” As the people in the hall were discussing, a loud laugh echoed outside. Wu Mian and others smiled.

“Go!” They stepped out of the hall, just in time to see a group approaching.

“Fire Elder and Hunshe Tianzun!” Seeing the two leading figures, their faces instantly lit up with joy.

Fire Elder and Tianzun were very familiar to them. However, Hunshe Tianzun was rarely seen; even during major events of the Wheel Turning Sect, he seldom appeared. Hunshe Tianzun, Yang Wu, an Immortal King at the initial stage. Now that the Wheel Turning Sect had many strong people, there were also several Immortal Kings at the initial stage. Yang Wu could maintain his Tianzun position with an Immortal King at the initial stage, relying on his mastery of formations.

Hell had no alchemists but had formation masters. Yang Wu’s formation skills were renowned throughout Hell.

Behind the two stood an Immortal King at the initial stage, a senior of the Wheel Turning Sect. This person was also known to Luo Tian—Zhang Tiantian.

When Luo Tian first arrived at the Wheel Turning Sect, Zhang Tiantian had helped him run around. Later, returning to his family, he used Luo Tian’s connections to help the Zhang family develop. Now the Zhang family was a prominent one in Hell, and Zhang Tiantian had reached the Immortal King at the initial stage.

“Respect to the two Tianzuns!” Wu Mian bowed, his eyes showing respect. The arrival of Fire Elder and Hunshe Tianzun had completely solved their urgent problem.

“Wu Mian, you’re in charge here. We’ll just contribute our strength!”

“Additionally, we’ve brought two million people. They should arrive in about two days!” Fire Elder smiled and spoke to Wu Mian.

“Two million people!” Wu Mian slightly moved, though he couldn’t see his face. But he could feel Wu Mian’s excitement. With these two million people, they could free up manpower to attack Tianhun City and take it without much problem.

“Good, let the brothers prepare. Three days later, we’ll attack Tianhun City again!” Wu Mian spoke and led Fire Elder and others into the meeting hall.

The situation was tense. Although the Immortal realm had become chaotic, Tianyuan Sect seemed unaffected.

A streak of light fell on the gates of Tianyuan Sect. The person had a pale face and was still wearing blood-stained clothes.

“Master Run!” Two gatekeepers immediately recognized the visitor, their faces filled with shock. They quickly helped lift Master Run.

“Quickly take me to see the Sect Leader!” Master Run’s legs were weak. In three days, he had rushed back with injuries, and it was only a few days before he returned to Tianyuan Sect.

The two disciples didn’t delay, quickly sending messages and helping Master Run into the sect.

“What? Master Run returned alone?” A series of confused voices arose. A group of figures quickly gathered in the Tianyuan Sect’s meeting hall.

“What happened?” As Master Run entered the sect, a series of streaks rushed toward him. They saw his pale face and weak aura.

“Where are Long Jie and the others? Why is it just you?” Diao Dezhu and others saw Master Run, especially his injuries. They thought something serious had happened.

“Luo Tian is still alive!” Master Run saw the anxious looks of everyone and could guess their thoughts. He smiled slightly and spoke to them.

“What!” Hearing Master Run’s words, everyone’s bodies trembled slightly. They immediately surrounded Master Run.

“Do you want to strangle me?” Master Run weakly spoke to Diao Dezhu and others who grabbed him excitedly.

“Ugh…” Everyone quickly let go of Master Run, but it made his eyes roll back and he fainted.

“Damn it, Diao Dezhu, why did you use so much strength!” Wan Lingkong cursed and kicked Diao Dezhu’s butt.

“Fool, didn’t you grab him!” Diao Dezhu cursed back but his eyes were slightly moist.

“Is it you, kid? Why did you use so much strength!” Sun Ke nian also kicked Diao Dezhu.

“Is it you!” A group of people immediately started chaos, kicking Diao Dezhu’s body.

“You guys are beasts!” Diao Dezhu cried out, and the group carried Master Run into the hall.

“Quickly, give Master Run some pills. Ask what happened!” Everyone rushed to treat Master Run. Master Run was just exhausted, and his injuries were gradually recovering with the pills. He slowly opened his eyes.

“Luo Tian is still alive! I and Long Jie and Yao Chen saw Luo Tian at Kamen…” Master Run spoke, recounting the situation at Kamen to everyone.

“Haha! I said Luo Tian wasn’t that easy to die!” The hall immediately erupted in thunderous laughter, causing the disciples of Tianyuan Sect to be puzzled.

“Master Luo isn’t dead!” However, soon the disciples understood why everyone was laughing.

“Of course! The Sect Leaders were so excited!” The entire Tianyuan Sect immediately became lively, everyone discussing this matter.

In the meeting hall of Tianyuan Sect, Jiang Síxi had been seated in the center. Her face was filled with excitement. Since she became the Sect Leader of Tianyuan Sect, she rarely showed such an expression; this was after a long time of calm that she sat here. Below her were Diao Dezhu, Nan Gong Yuqing and others, all excited. The entire Tianyuan Sect was very excited.

“Sect Leader, since Luo Tian is at Kamen, we should go there too. We can’t be against Luo Tian!” Nan Gong Yuqing spoke.

“No, we can’t go. It’s not that easy to leave. With so many people, they’ll definitely be discovered by the Nine Immortal Mountains. If I’m not mistaken, they already know Luo Tian is alive and are deliberately keeping it from us.”

“Those old foxes want us to fight against Luo Tian!” Everyone quickly gritted their teeth. Those present, who were experienced, naturally knew what the Nine Immortal Mountains were planning.

“Now the only thing to do is get Luo Tian to regain his memory. Master Lu and Master Run should go personally to Bontian Mountain and contact Jiang Yuexiong, telling him about Luo Tian’s situation. See if there’s any way!”

“Also, if the Nine Immortal Mountains ask us to support them, we’ll support. But not for real fighting!”

“Sun Ke nian, Si Ma Tuo, Diao Dezhu, prepare. Regaining Luo Tian’s memory definitely needs elixirs or treasures. No matter if you steal or rob, make sure it’s ready!” Jiang Síxi calmly issued orders.

Everyone left the hall and started to busy themselves, thinking about how to restore Luo Tian’s memory. Once his memory was restored, that would be the top priority.

…At the same time, Hell’s second wave of reinforcements arrived at Bontian City. A total of two million people, but this time the people were quite chaotic, mostly families from Hell.

“Let’s go! We’ll continue to attack Tianhun City. We’ve already taken Bontian City, I don’t believe a small Tianhun City can’t be taken!” Wu Mian spoke authoritatively. He left the family forces stationed in Bontian City and led his main force toward Bontian City again, determined to take it this time.

As Wu Mian’s army set out, Jiang Chen’s scouts discovered it. The people of Tianhun City received the news and Jiang Chen frowned, looking at Long Jie.

“Elder Long, when will Tianyuan Sect’s reinforcements arrive?” Jiang Chen’s face was dark. It had already been five days, and Tianyuan Sect’s reinforcements hadn’t arrived yet. Every time he asked, Long Jie had an excuse.

“Um… they should arrive tomorrow. Maybe it’s because of the climate, our Tianyuan Sect people all had diarrhea!”

“Lord, don’t worry. We’re still here, right? Last time we defeated them thoroughly. This time will be the same!” Long Jie confidently spoke.

Chapter 2524: Fighting Yao Chen()

“Defeat them? Your ass!” Jiang Chen was furious. How could a cultivator have climate issues?

“Then we’ll wait!” However, Jiang Chen didn’t dare to show his anger. At the same time, he secretly decided to contact Bontian Mountain again.

“Can you think of a better excuse? This one is hard to believe!” Yao Chen transmitted thoughts to Long Jie.

“Think what, I’ve asked sixteen times in three days. How can I think? Do whatever you want!” Long Jie replied, making Yao Chen almost laugh out loud.

“Nobody respects you but me!” Yao Chen held back his laughter. After all, these things weren’t his idea; he just fought.

“What now? Hell’s army has already set out. Last time we retreated, but this time they are well-prepared. We won’t be able to resist this time and we’ve lost one Immortal King!” Ke Duanshan spoke seriously.

“See the situation. If it’s no good, we’ll have to retreat again!” Jiang Chen said with a headache.

Time passed slowly. One day slipped by, and the black army of Hell appeared again, surrounding Tianhun City.

“Tianhun City’s bastards! Who dares to fight us!” The Hell army shouted again, their voices echoing outside the city.

“Let’s check!” Jiang Chen’s face was dark because they had waited a day and Tianyuan Sect’s reinforcements still hadn’t arrived.

Standing on the city wall, the shouting voices entered everyone's ears. Yao Chen immediately felt like fighting and flew up to the battlefield.

With Yao Chen’s appearance, the Hell people fell silent. After all, they had seen his strength before.

“Come on! Who’s itching for a beating? I’ll give you one!” Yao Chen held his golden staff, scanning the Hell army. Even with thousands of troops, his aura remained undiminished.

Everyone focused on Luo Tian because he had fought four people before and was fearless.

“Immortal King at the middle stage. They’ve brought an Immortal King at the middle stage!” Ke Duanshan and Jiang Chen’s faces changed as they saw Yu Tian standing at the front of the Hell army.

“Three million people, more than a million compared to before. The Hell reinforcements have arrived!” Jiang Chen’s face darkened. Three million people surrounded Tianhun City, all over the place were Hell ghosts and ghost cultivators.

“This time, we can’t even retreat!” Ke Duanshan spoke. Now Tianhun City had become a complete island.

“They want us to die slowly, reducing their losses. We can only fight back; if we don’t fight back, Wu Mian will definitely issue an attack order!” Jiang Chen spoke seriously. He cursed Long Jie’s ancestors eighteen times in his heart.

If Tianyuan Sect's reinforcements arrived, they wouldn’t be so passive. They could have even attacked Kamen before. Now they were surrounded and to escape would definitely cost a lot.

“This is like acting for me!” Jiang Chen cursed inwardly, but he really had no one to rely on.

“Luo Tian, come out and fight! It’s not meaningful fighting others!” Yao Chen shouted loudly. He didn’t care about anyone else.

“Is this monkey crazy? It seems like he’s attacking us!” The Hell people were speechless after hearing Yao Chen's challenge.

“You don’t need to let the Saint Prince fight. I can handle it!” Zhang Tianhe flew up, respecting Luo Tian and wouldn’t let anyone insult him.

“Be careful. If you can't win, run!” Luo Tian watched Zhang Tianhe fly out and gave a warning. He had fought Yao Chen before, knowing his difficulty. Even he would need to put in a lot of effort and use all his tricks to beat Yao Chen.

Zhang Tianhe held his sword, flew up, and stepped out of the formation.

“Don’t call me a monkey!” Yao Chen heard Zhang Tianhe’s words, his eyes flashed golden light. His staff emitted a buzzing sound and he swung it without hesitation.

Zhang Tianhe’s face slightly changed. He raised his sword to meet the attack, and a collision sound echoed. Zhang Tianhe’s body sank a hundred zhang, his palm cracked, and blood spurted from his mouth.

“Good kid! You’ve got some moves!” Yao Chen looked at Zhang Tianhe, who was fine. He swung his staff again.

Zhang Tianhe saw the overwhelming staff’s aura and slightly changed his face. He hadn’t expected him to be so strong that he trembled.

“Don’t let the Saint Prince’s name be disgraced!” Zhang Tianhe gritted his teeth and his sword exploded in size, radiating a terrifying aura. He met Yao Chen’s attack.

“Crack…” Thunder echoed through the heavens. Zhang Tianhe's strong attack was still repelled, and he spat blood.

“Interesting! You can withstand my two attacks. That shows you are a top-tier Immortal King at the initial stage!” Yao Chen’s face showed amusement. He didn’t continue to fight, waiting for Zhang Tianhe to recover.

“Is this a person?” The Hell people saw Zhang Tianhe being beaten and blood spurted, their faces filled with shock looking at Yao Chen’s overwhelming aura.

“He isn’t a person. He's a monkey!” But then they suddenly realized, Yao Chen’s appearance was definitely not human.

“Our Saint Prince is the strongest. He defeated four people before, and now he can fight with this monkey. Obviously, his strength is comparable!” The Hell people then looked at Luo Tian with respect. To be able to escape from such a four-person attack, how terrifying must Luo Tian’s strength be?

Without comparison, people finally understood the terrifying combat power of Luo Tian.

Previously, they thought Yao Chen’s one staff almost killed Zhou Yuan. His strength was just ordinary Immortal King level, because if it were a top-tier Immortal King at the initial stage, Zhou Yuan would have died.

While people were shocked, Yao Chen struck again. His body radiated waves of energy and he swung another staff, his voice thunderous, making Zhang Tianhe’s face show shock.

“Next time, don’t call me a monkey. Otherwise, I’ll beat you so much that even your mother wouldn’t recognize you!” Yao Chen’s cold voice echoed in Zhang Tianhe's ears, making him tremble.

“Boom…” A golden afterimage appeared before Zhang Tianhe. It struck his sword, sending him flying back into the Hell side.

The people of Bontian City immediately cheered loudly. The Hell side fell silent, unable to say anything as Yao Chen’s strength left them speechless.

Luo Tian flew up and caught Zhang Tianhe. Checking, he found no life-threatening injuries. His heart eased slightly.

“We still have a chance to defend Tianhun City!” Jiang Chen and Ke Duanshan immediately felt hope. The enemy now had one less Immortal King at the initial stage, and their strength was weakened.

“Who else is coming? Can you bring someone stronger?” Yao Chen looked at Luo Tian, his eyes filled with battle spirit.

“As you wish!” Luo Tian coldly spoke. His blood sword appeared in his hand, and he stood a hundred zhang away from Yao Chen.

“Saint Prince, defeat him!” Seeing Luo Tian appear, the Hell people cheered again.

“You monkey! Daring to harm Hell’s people!” Luo Tian coldly looked at Yao Chen, determined to severely punish him. But he still followed Fu Xingxuan’s advice and didn’t want to kill Yao Chen. He felt he could only wound Yao Chen, but defeating him was still difficult.

“Your grandfather!” Yao Chen heard Luo Tian’s words and didn’t hesitate. He rushed toward Luo Tian with his staff, golden dragons swirling around it.

Luo Tian faced Yao Chen’s attack without fear. He raised his blood sword and rushed toward Yao Chen.

“Buzz…” The clash of swords and staffs echoed. Both instantly began fighting, with the sound of collisions constantly echoing. Many people only saw two streaks of light colliding and then a thunderous explosion.

The heavens cracked, the earth roared. People’s faces showed shock. Previously it was four people fighting one, but now it was a one-on-one battle.

“Saint Prince has some advantage!” Wu Mian and others watched the fight. They saw Luo Tian had the upper hand.

Their battle was simple, swords and staffs colliding repeatedly. Within a hundred exchanges, neither side had won.

“Get down!” Luo Tian held his sword with both hands and slashed downward. Yao Chen’s face darkened, raising his staff to block.

“Both of them used one hand. Obviously, they didn’t use their full strength. This monkey’s origin is unknown!” Wu Mian and others exclaimed.

“An ancient supernatural beast, the Battle Divine Ape!” Yu Tian spoke. His voice was heavy; he understood Luo Tian’s strength and also recognized Yao Chen's identity.

“Legend says the Nine Immortal Mountains’ Mount Mifan has a Battle Divine Buddha, who is the Battle Divine Ape. His combat power is legendary, known as invincible at his level!” Yu Tian, a senior of the Wheel Turning Sect, was well-informed. Hell also had some knowledge about the Nine Immortal Mountains.

“Luo Tian, you really mean it!” Yao Chen shouted. He felt Luo Tian had become serious and cursed.

“I won’t let anyone harm Hell’s people!” Luo Tian coldly spoke. He activated the Law of Heaven and Earth, his massive foot coming down.

“Good!” Yao Chen’s eyes showed no anger but excitement. His body transformed into a giant ape and he punched Luo Tian's foot.

“Boom…”

Luo Tian was pushed back, taking another step. The heavens roared, the winds reversed.

Yao Chen kept roaring and punching, fighting against Luo Tian’s Seven Steps of the Divine Beast. He managed to block all seven steps, but his feet were constantly cracking until the ground beneath him was shattered into a massive pit.

“Zhanbiao, prepare to fight. I’m afraid this monkey will go crazy!” Yao Chen saw his energy gradually becoming wild and knew his old problem was about to return.

“Don’t worry, big brother can handle it. I’m itching for a fight!”

“I’ll go fight too!” Chen Zhanbiao replied, flying up and rushing toward the battlefield.

Chapter 2525: Unbeatable()

“Zhanbiao, come back!” Long Jie shouted. But Chen Zhanbiao had already rushed out of Tianhun City, making Long Jie’s face dark.

“Those two bastards!” Long Jie cursed under his breath, feeling that bringing them was a mistake.

“Are they going to surround again?” Seeing Chen Zhanbiao rush out, he knew this big guy was no pushover. He had endured Luo Tian’s Seven Steps of the Divine Beast without a problem.
