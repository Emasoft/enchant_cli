Leng Qiuchan seemed to sense the cold gaze behind her. She turned and cast a glance at Lin Changqing and Dong Zhiyong, her eyes instantly turning icy upon seeing them. A furious wave of killing intent surged toward the two men without concealment.

"Hmph?" Dong Zhiyong and Lin Changqing felt Leng Qiuchan's unguarded killing intent, their brows furrowing slightly. Dong Zhiyong did not know Leng Qiuchan's identity, and after a cold snort, he thought it absurd for an early-stage Soul-Ember cultivator to dare unleash killing intent against him. How could he tolerate such an insult?

Seeing Dong Zhiyong about to strike, Lin Changqing quickly intercepted him. "She is the daughter of the Master of Yuling Sect—don't act rashly!"

Upon hearing Lin Changqing's words, Dong Zhiyong's face showed a moment of inner struggle before finally calming. He consoled himself with the principle of avoiding conflict with Yuling Sect if possible, knowing that if Leng Qiuchan and Luo Tian died, he would have no place left in the Eastern Region.

Leng Qiuchan merely glanced at them before returning her attention to Luo Tian. At this moment, the thunderous roars gradually faded, and the storm clouds above began to dissipate.

Looking at Luo Tian, he was in a pitiful state—no signs of life remained on his body. His form was indistinguishable from a pile of blackened flesh.

Five crystalline soul-bones emitted five-colored halos, but the glows were dim to the point of being obscured within the mangled flesh.

"Luo Tian!" Leng Qiuchan cried out, waiting for the storm clouds to fully vanish.

"Failure!" Seeing the storm clouds gradually dissipating, Lin Changqing and Dong Zhiyong's faces showed relief. They waited for the storm clouds to vanish, then planned to confirm Luo Tian's death and claim his treasures before leaving.

Under the three's gazes, the storm clouds slowly dispersed. The thunderclaps seemed to realize their target had perished and vanished into the void.

Even sunlight began seeping through, illuminating Luo Tian's flesh-like form.

An hour passed. As the storm clouds were about to vanish, Leng Qiuchan and the two men prepared to move when a thunderous roar erupted from Luo Tian's ruined body, causing them to frown in surprise.

After the thunderous roar faded, five-colored lightning surrounded Luo Tian's body. Then green vitality surged forth.

Yet the storm clouds above, which had already vanished, began to coalesce again under their stunned gazes.

"Impossible!"

"Not even the thunderclaps deemed him dead—how could he revive!" Lin Changqing and Dong Zhiyong exclaimed in disbelief, staring at Luo Tian's body crackling with thunder.

Leng Qiuchan smiled: "I said your life belongs to me. Even heaven cannot take it!"

"Thunderous roar..." As if responding to the thunderous roars from Luo Tian's body, a heavy atmosphere returned to the sky. Thunderous claps echoed again from the storm clouds above, as if preparing another lightning strike.

Thunderous roars, surging green vitality, and gusts of wind filled the three's ears.

Luo Tian's already ruined body inexplicably radiated boundless vitality, its power surging toward the heavens as if challenging the storm clouds.

Under their gazes, Luo Tian's body slowly healed. This evolution was more thorough than before, revealing white bones that continuously sprouted new flesh.

"One hour... two hours..." Time passed slowly. The storm clouds above seemed to wait for Luo Tian's rebirth, hesitating to unleash another thunderclap.

After an hour, under Leng Qiuchan's delighted gaze, Luo Tian finally restored to his original state. However, upon seeing him recover, Leng Qiuchan immediately turned away, her face burning beneath the black veil.

Though Luo Tian was wrapped in green vitality, Leng Qiuchan's eyes were sharp. She immediately noticed Luo Tian was naked.

After his body recovered, about an hour passed before Luo Tian suddenly opened his eyes. If one looked closely, his eyes seemed to contain lightning and thunder.

"Thankfully I had previously refined the Wind-Thunder Jade Heart! I've grasped the essence of lightning and wood attributes. Otherwise, I wouldn't have survived this thunderclap!" Luo Tian muttered, a smile on his face.

"The thunderclaps haven't fully vanished. I'm no longer afraid of their power now. You can only become my nourishment!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with a smile.

But then he noticed Leng Qiuchan had turned away. A chill ran up his legs—Luo Tian realized his clothes had all been destroyed by the thunderclaps.

Even with Luo Tian's thick skin, he turned red. He quickly waved his hand and retrieved a set of clothes from his storage ring, putting them on.

"Thunderous roar..." A deep thunderclap echoed above.

Luo Tian saw Leng Qiuchan and Dong Zhiyong nearby, a playful smile on his face. Thunderous roars echoed from his body as he activated the Fengtian Step, instantly appearing before Leng Qiuchan. He was now only hundreds of feet away from Dong Zhiyong.

Chapter 441: Using Others to Kill

Luo Tian arrived before Leng Qiuchan without waiting for her reaction, instantly placing her into his storage ring's Naling Bag.

Luo Tian had used wind, lightning, and gold attributes in his Fengtian Step. His speed reached its peak. Even Dong Zhiyong, an early-stage Soul-Ember cultivator, hadn't reacted. He only saw Luo Tian become a streak of lightning before vanishing from his sight, reappearing before Leng Qiuchan.

Dong Zhiyong and Lin Changqing stared at Luo Tian, speechless with shock.

After placing Leng Qiuchan in the Naling Bag, Luo Tian's face showed immense confidence. With such speed, he felt secure against an early-stage Soul-Ember cultivator. Even if it were a late-stage Soul-Ember, he could handle it with proper tactics.

He then looked at Dong Zhiyong and Lin Changqing with a playful expression, taking slow steps toward them.

"Thunderous roar..." The storm clouds above seemed to sense Dong Zhiyong and Lin Changqing's presence, violently churning.

Startled by the thunderous roars above, they showed fear. Dong Zhiyong no longer maintained his early-stage Soul-Ember demeanor.

"Damn it!"

"You dare defy me, Luo Tian!" They both cursed, their bodies retreating with all their might.

"Crack..." Two thick green lightning bolts seemed to target them, forming into serpentine dragons with overwhelming power. They struck the two men as they retreated.

The two men's faces showed grimaces. They both reached upward,凝聚 a surge of raw energy into an energy shield before them.

"Crack..." The green lightning struck the energy shield, instantly shattering it and striking the two men. Their bodies emitted faint smoke as they spat out blood, ignoring the pain and continuing to retreat.

"Indeed a Soul-Ember cultivator! Their body strength is far superior to that of an advanced Bone-Formation stage!" Luo Tian smiled, showing no concern for the green lightning striking him.

At this moment, Dong Zhiyong and Lin Changqing had retreated a thousand feet. They stared in shock as the green lightning struck Luo Tian's body, leaving no reaction—instead, it merged into his flesh as raw lightning energy.

"Brutal!"

Dong Zhiyong and Lin Changqing could no longer find words to describe Luo Tian.

Feeling Luo Tian was unharmed, the storm clouds churned again but did not unleash green lightning. Instead, they began to gather.

"Previously you struck me quite well. Now let's see what it feels like to be chased!" Luo Tian roared, activating the fifth step of Fengtian Step. He instantly appeared a hundred feet away from Lin Changqing and Dong Zhiyong.

"Luo Tian! I won't forgive you!" Dong Zhiyong and Lin Changqing, like a scalded cat, ran desperately. They even split up to escape.

But Luo Tian's speed had surpassed an early-stage Soul-Ember. His form flickered, instantly appearing before Lin Changqing: "Stay here!"

Luo Tian didn't attack. He simply smiled, waiting for the thunderclaps to fall.

"Thunderous roar..." As if enraged, the storm clouds emitted a deafening thunderclap.

Under Lin Changqing's terrified gaze, two thick black lightning bolts pierced through the sky, striking Luo Tian and Lin Changqing.

"Damn it!" Lin Changqing could clearly feel the black lightning's power. Even if he were hit, he would be instantly reduced to ashes.

"Pf!" Lin Changqing had no other options. This Luo Tian was like a leech, refusing to let go.

Lin Changqing spat out his essence blood, transforming it into a thick surge of power. He grasped a green sword, forming a towering blade of energy that surged toward the black lightning.

Luo Tian was stunned by the black lightning, his heart trembling again. He secretly marveled at how he had played too big.

"What the hell is this thing!" Luo Tian's face showed fear.

At that moment, Luo Tian had no time to think. He summoned the Zhenning Vessel and hurled it into the sky.

"I damn well want to know!" Lin Changqing was almost crying. His sword strike had been his strongest, even burning his essence blood.

But it was so fragile and powerless against the black lightning. In an instant, it was swallowed by the black lightning.

Luo Tian fared slightly better. The Zhenning Vessel, a supreme treasure, sealed the black lightning's path.

But it could only hold for a while before flying out of the thunderclap, emitting a continuous humming sound. Luo Tian could clearly feel the vessel's fear, as if it had met its nemesis.

As Luo Tian was stunned, the black lightning struck Lin Changqing.

Under Luo Tian's trembling gaze, Lin Changqing was pale to the core. That strike had burned several drops of his essence blood, leaving him greatly weakened. Now, being struck by the lightning made him even more helpless.

But to Luo Tian's surprise, that terrifying lightning had no effect on Lin Changqing's body. Lin Changqing remained frozen in the moment of impact, like a statue.

Luo Tian only glanced at Lin Changqing before he had no time to care about others. The black lightning still struck him.

At this moment, Dong Zhiyong, breathing heavily, appeared in the distance. He had never heard of such lightning.

"Thankfully I ran fast!" Dong Zhiyong wiped his forehead, watching Luo Tian seemingly bathed in the black lightning.

Luo Tian was not faring well. He had thought he no longer feared thunderclaps, but the black lightning struck his body directly into his soul.

"Ahh..." Luo Tian couldn't hold back, screaming loudly. His soul, comparable to a late-stage Soul-Ember, was constantly weakened by the black lightning.

"One... two..." The black lightning seemed to continuously wash Luo Tian's soul.

Chapter 442: Three Soul-Ember Trials

Luo Tian felt his soul constantly draining. He sighed at the black lightning's power while also being puzzled. They had passed four thunderclaps, plus the subsequent formless lightning, totaling nine. He didn't understand why this tenth thunderclap had appeared.

But after thinking for a moment, he focused on his soul. Under the terrifying power of the black lightning, his soul constantly drained.

Soul strength was still a mystery to him. He could only pray that his extraordinary soul could withstand the black lightning's drain.

"What the hell is this thing!" Dong Zhiyong cursed in his heart, watching Lin Changqing standing like a statue. He desperately wanted to know if Lin Changqing was alive or dead.

"Two... four... eight..." When Luo Tian's soul drained to eight, the black lightning stopped.

Luo Tian's face was completely pale. Yet his eyes showed joy. The storm clouds finally stopped churning, vanishing into the sky within moments, revealing golden sunlight.

"Finally over! If it were a normal Bone-Formation stage master, how many times would they have died!" Luo Tian sighed.

Dong Zhiyong saw the thunderclaps end. He wiped his face, unsure if he could survive another attack from Luo Tian.

But at this moment, Luo Tian merely stood palely without any major harm.

Luo Tian turned to Lin Changqing standing there, a light sigh on his face. He extended his powerful soul sense, feeling Lin Changqing's soul had been extinguished and his body destroyed by the lightning.

He slowly approached Lin Changqing, lightly tapping on his body with a finger.

"Boom..." Under Luo Tian's touch, Lin Changqing's body instantly turned to ash. In Dong Zhiyong's stunned gaze, it scattered into the air with the wind.

Luo Tian showed no expression. His eyes carried coldness as he looked at Dong Zhiyong nearby.

Dong Zhiyong's entire body felt like being struck by lightning. He felt as if a venomous snake had stared at him, his whole body cold.

"Hmph. Though your thunderclaps are quite unconventional, this is only the first step of the Soul-Ember trial. To enter the Soul-Ember realm, you still need two more trials. I wonder if you can survive!" Dong Zhiyong sneered, as if to bolster his courage. He thought about how a late-stage Soul-Ember master had been scared by an uninitiated youth, feeling some frustration.

"Thunderous roar..." A deep sound echoed from Luo Tian's feet. It drew his attention back.

To enter the Soul-Ember realm, one must endure three trials: sky trial, earth trial, and human trial! Among these, the sky trial was the most ruthless. The earth trial was relatively gentle. The human trial was the most difficult of the three.

Luo Tian had already passed the sky trial. Now, as the ground roared, it was clear he would face the earth trial of the three Soul-Ember trials.

"Boom..." Under Luo Tian's expectant gaze, after passing the sky trial, the ground suddenly erupted with massive stone pillars rising like mountains.

"One... ten... a hundred..." The booming sound echoed continuously. Nine hundred and ninety-nine pillars shot up from the ground within a moment, surrounding Luo Tian in the center.

After the nine hundred and ninety-nine pillars stood upright, each emitted a heavy aura. They converged together.

Luo Tian felt his feet like lead, unable to move an inch.

"Buzz..." But just as he was confused, a wave of movement came from under his feet. A dark fissure like a mouth appeared behind him, slowly approaching Luo Tian.

Luo Tian turned and saw the dark fissure. It was bottomless, as if falling into it would send one to hell.

"Damn it! They said the second trial was gentler, but I still feel like dying if I fall in!" Luo Tian cursed. He ran forward, feeling that breaking out of this cage-like place would mean he had passed the second trial.

"Fengtian Step!" Luo Tian roared, forcing himself to use the Fengtian Step to reach a hundred feet away from the pillars.

"Damn it!" But as he activated the Fengtian Step, Luo Tian's face turned grim. Using the fourth step of the Fengtian Step, his figure moved like a snail.

"What's the gravity here?" Dong Zhiyong wondered in his heart.

"Chen Hongfei! You secretly left Beichang County and destroyed my Lishui City. Where is my nephew!" Just as Dong Zhiyong was wondering, a cold voice entered his ears.

"Dong Hongfei!" Dong Zhiyong's body trembled, whispering lowly.

A sound of breaking through the air echoed. Chen Hongfei's figure, filled with rage, flew over from afar. His voice hadn't finished speaking before his body was already at Dong Zhiyong's side.

Chen Hongfei's face almost bled. He looked at the destroyed Lishui City and immediately launched a water-element energy fist toward Dong Zhiyong.

The sound of impact echoed. Dong Zhiyong's eyes showed a serious expression. His golden fist met Chen Hongfei's fist.

Dong Zhiyong's face was grim as he took a few steps back. His strength and Chen Hongfei's were evenly matched. Previously, he had chased Luo Tian and faced another thunderclap, which was a bit of a drain. Chen Hongfei was in full strength. After one strike, the result would be clear.

"Go!" Dong Zhiyong knew that with Chen Hongfei's return, he had no chance.

His energy wings flared behind him. He instantly appeared before the stunned Dong Zimou, grabbing him and flying into the sky. He took a long look at Chen Hongfei and Luo Tian in the distance before flying away.

"Think you can leave without paying a price?" Chen Hongfei knew he could suppress Dong Zhiyong now, but he couldn't stop him from escaping.

He lightly tapped his fingers. Two water-element energy dragons instantly emerged from his fingertips, appearing behind Dong Zhiyong who had already flown a thousand feet away.

"You killed my descendant. I'll destroy your炼金城!" Chen Hongfei's face was dark, growling.

"Pf! Boom..." One water-element dragon pierced through Dong Zimou's back, while the other贯穿ed Dong Zhiyong's leg.

Dong Zhiyong was a Soul-Ember master, so he didn't suffer as much as Dong Zimou. However, this water arrow still made his leg numb.

"Rippling..." The water arrows instantly turned into a stream, wetting Dong Zhiyong's leg.

"Hmph..." Chen Hongfei's lips curled into a smile, watching Dong Zhiyong's escape direction.

Chapter 443: Piercing the Cage with a Single Shot

At this moment, Luo Tian didn't know what was happening outside. He felt his space seemed like an independent one. Step by step, he walked toward the pillars that looked nearby.

"Rippling..." The sound of ground cracking echoed, making Luo Tian's heart tremble.

"I can't do this. At my current speed, I don't know how long it'll take to reach the pillars. But this ground cracking is going to reach my feet within half a moment!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly.

"Fengtian Step, fifth step!" Luo Tian roared, activating the fifth step of Fengtian Step. But his speed only slightly increased—still couldn't match the ground cracking's pace.

"It still won't work! I'll have to try the sixth step!" Luo Tian gritted his teeth, a fierce look on his face. He had no other options.

The sixth step of Fengtian Step—Luo Tian didn't know if his body could withstand its intense冲击. But now, he had no choice but to take the risk.

Golden, lightning, and wind elements surged beneath his feet. Thunderous sounds echoed from under Luo Tian's body. His entire body emitted a sound like firecrackers, and under this increased gravity, he vanished from his spot like the wind.

"Snort..." The next moment, Luo Tian's figure appeared a hundred feet away. His face showed pain.

"One hundred feet..." Luo Tian stared at the distance of the sixth step of Fengtian Step, his mouth twitching.

The sixth step of Fengtian Step cost Luo Tian a great deal. If it weren't for the previous thunderclap refining his body, he wouldn't have dared to use the sixth step. Even so, Luo Tian's already pale face became even paler. Just one step had left him covered in wounds, his body dyed red with blood.

"Rippling..." A sound like an earthquake echoed behind Luo Tian, making him want to cry.

"Damn it! I'll take the risk!" Luo Tian ignored his pain, moving again with the sixth step of Fengtian Step.

One step forward, Luo Tian's figure appeared another hundred feet away. At this moment, the distance to the pillars was only two hundred feet. But for Luo Tian, it was like the difference between heaven and earth.

"I don't have time! I've used the sixth step twice. My body's load has reached its limit. If I continue, it'll definitely damage my core. The soul I lost earlier hasn't recovered yet. If I add more injury, I won't be able to survive the human trial!"

Luo Tian thought this and showed determination. He didn't care about the cracks opening behind him. His spear, Lietian, appeared in his hand.

"It's time to try the third form. If this form is comparable to a level-graded martial art, it'll be my secret weapon!" Luo Tian roared, lifting his spear and rotating the five elements' energy within him.

"Five Elements in Harmony... Gold Sea Sand!" Luo Tian roared, filling the entire space with gold.

"Rippling..." The golden spear image became a golden ocean, like a towering wave that crashed toward the two hundred feet away pillars.

"Boom..." Countless spear tips collided with the pillars.

"One... ten... a hundred..." The pillars were instantly destroyed, collapsing one hundred in this strike. Dust flew everywhere, obscuring Chen Hongfei's vision.

"Success!" Chen Hongfei showed joy on his face, watching the destroyed Lishui City. He could easily guess how terrifying Luo Tian's thunderclaps had been.

At the moment the pillars collapsed, the cracks about to swallow Luo Tian suddenly stopped and closed instantly.

Luo Tian looked at the ground, now intact. If he had been swallowed in, he would have certainly been crushed into meat paste.

"Thankfully, this second trial was much better than the first!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He took out a pill and put it in his mouth to recover.

"Breath..." Luo Tian caught his breath, looking at Chen Hongfei standing a thousand feet away. A smile finally appeared on his face.

Chen Hongfei's arrival made Luo Tian feel relieved. Even if he hadn't passed the trial, Leng Qiuchan and Zheng Xinlong's safety should be fine.

"But wait—if I died in the thunderclaps, then Longbao would have escaped from the seal. But we are still bound together. If I died, then Longbao would definitely die too!" Luo Tian's gaze, which had just relaxed, turned serious again.

"Luo Tian! The third trial is the human trial. It should be fought against people. So you have plenty of time to recover to your peak state!" Chen Hongfei's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Breath..." Luo Tian took a deep breath and sat cross-legged, beginning to recover his cultivation. As for his soul, he didn't know how to repair it. He certainly wouldn't use Qianping's method.

Luo Tian could only activate the Xiu Hun Duo Po诀. To his surprise, it actually worked. His remaining two percent of soul was slowly repairing.

Chen Hongfei stood a thousand feet away, his face showing a sense of admiration. He remembered the first time he saw Luo Tian—this man had been known as Luo Lei, chased like a dog by several Bone-Formation stage masters in Beichang County.

Now, only less than two years had passed. This young man barely past twenty had already passed the second trial of the three Soul-Ember trials.

"Guess this kid would cause a commotion if he returned to Beichang County!" Chen Hongfei smiled. He had already told himself through his soul sense that the Ding family and daughter were safe, easing his dark expression.

As Luo Tian sat cross-legged to recover, in the center of Beichang County, it was also a mess. A young man in black robes, his mouth bleeding, looked at a gray mist forming into a figure before him. This young man was Yang Huanyu, who had escaped from Luo Tian's grasp through the Polar Light Wings and arrived in Beichang County.

If a Soul-Ember master were here, they would be shocked. Yang Huanyu was currently enduring the third trial of the three Soul-Ember trials—human trial.

"Unexpectedly, this third trial is you! Die!" Yang Huanyu's face showed weakness. He held his spear and attacked the gray mist figure.

...

A day passed. Luo Tian's body once again emitted a rolling thunderous sound.

Suddenly, Luo Tian opened his eyes. His gaze was deep as he looked at the sky. Although his soul and body were fully recovered, his entire body radiated a powerful aura.

"I feel I can pierce through the sky!" Luo Tian's face showed intense battle spirit. His Lietian spear was in his hand, radiating a self-assured aura.

Chapter 444: Human Trial

Feeling Luo Tian's body was now fully recovered, the sky once again echoed with thunderous roars. But no lightning fell.

A thick mist descended from the sky, as if it were raining fog.

Under Luo Tian's expectant gaze, the mist accumulated gradually and eventually formed a human shape.

This gray figure was what stunned Luo Tian. The gray person clearly resembled himself. If it had a living skin tone, it would be an exact duplicate.

Ding Hongfei's face was completely shocked. His mouth looked like he had eaten an egg, showing intense disbelief.

He knew what this gray figure represented. The third trial of the Soul-Ember trials—human trial. This gray figure was the strongest master of the Bone-Formation stage in history.

At this moment, this gray figure was Luo Tian. It meant that from ancient times, Luo Tian had replaced the previous strongest Bone-Formation master.

What an astonishing combat power! According to records, since the ancient times of immortals had mysteriously collapsed, no one had ever replaced this gray figure for the third trial.

"Too outrageous!" Ding Hongfei was overwhelmed with shock. At the same time, his face showed anticipation. He really wanted to see how strong Luo Tian would become after entering the Soul-Ember realm.

Under Luo Tian and Ding Hongfei's expectant gazes, the gray figure gradually solidified.

"Lietian Spear!" Luo Tian roared.

"Snort..." But as he shouted, his soul, just recovered, ached. The Lietian Spear seemed to ignore his call and remained in the storage ring.

"Can't use weapons?" Luo Tian muttered. He could feel his storage ring was sealed.

"Fine!" He would test how strong his newly refined body was. Luo Tian's feet surged with wind and thunder, his face showing battle spirit as he rushed toward the gray figure.

The gray figure also moved instantly toward Luo Tian. Wind and thunder surged from the gray figure's body.

A powerful explosion echoed as Luo Tian and the gray figure collided, then quickly separated. They kept retreating.

"Even our steps are the same?" Luo Tian's face showed seriousness. He now understood this gray figure was another version of himself.

Ding Hongfei's explanation echoed in Luo Tian's mind, making him feel energized. He thought about how everyone who endured the Soul-Ember trial would face this same challenge, his mouth slightly lifting.

"Defeat yourself!" Luo Tian roared and took the fifth step of Fengtian Step toward the gray figure.

The gray figure did the same as Luo Tian. It took the fifth step of Fengtian Step, its face showing a human-like smile as it rushed forward.

Explosions echoed continuously from around Luo Tian and the gray figure.

Luo Tian was increasingly shocked. He hadn't expected himself to be so strong, and this gray figure could do everything he could. Even his martial arts fusion with the gray figure seemed to be executed faster.

Luo Tian had many techniques. Even without the three spear skills of Lietian Spear, he could use many other martial arts.

The explosions were overwhelming. Luo Tian used all his techniques but couldn't defeat the gray figure. Instead, he was gradually suppressed and forced to defend passively.

Ding Hongfei showed admiration toward Luo Tian and the gray figure, silently mourning for those who would face this human trial in the future. He also secretly felt relieved that he had been born a few years earlier, otherwise encountering this变态 human trial would have kept him at the Bone-Formation stage forever.

"Can't continue like this. I'll definitely lose! Need to think of a way. But all my methods have already been used. Where else can I find another method!" Luo Tian's forehead was covered in sweat, his body gradually showing wounds.

One hour... two hours...

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian and the gray figure had fought for over an hour. With his energy running low, his face showed exhaustion.

"Since my things, he has them too. I need to think about our differences!" Luo Tian's face showed anxiety, his mind constantly thinking.

"纪元之书!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with gold. He thought of the "Book of Epochs," but his gaze darkened.

The Book of Epochs, he was certain this gray figure didn't have it. But the Book of Epochs had always been a stubborn one, never listening to him. How could he use it?

"Try!" Luo Tian sighed. At this moment, the Book of Epochs was his only option.

He immediately directed his spiritual sense into his mind. A powerful golden ocean surged toward the Book of Epochs.

The golden ocean struck the Book of Epochs, making it tremble slightly.

"Hope!" Luo Tian's face showed great joy. He suddenly realized he hadn't pushed the Book of Epochs since entering the peak of spiritual sense.

After thinking, his gaze became more intense. Thunderous sounds echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

Time passed another hour. Under Luo Tian's continuous pushing, the Book of Epochs finally responded. In Luo Tian's excited gaze, it slowly opened.

Luo Tian's soul felt like entering another space. He saw the familiar figure again.

To Ding Hongfei, Luo Tian had closed his eyes. His body was still fighting the gray figure but was at a disadvantage. However, his face showed increasing confidence.

An hour passed quickly. Ding Hongfei was increasingly worried about Luo Tian. His eyes were still tightly closed, and his wounds were increasing. He was already in a pitiful state.

Suddenly, Luo Tian's mouth slightly lifted. After an hour of closing his eyes, he suddenly opened them, two cold glares flashing.

Luo Tian felt himself return to his body. He felt the wounds on his body, a cold smile on his face: "I'll see if my new martial arts can be done by you or not!"

With that, Luo Tian took the fifth step of Fengtian Step and appeared a hundred feet away. His hands quickly changed.

Seeing Luo Tian's departure, the gray figure rushed after him like a leopard. It wouldn't give Luo Tian any chance to catch his breath.

"Really and truly like me! You don't even give me a moment to breathe!" Luo Tian was angry. His body disappeared again, but his hands didn't stop moving.

Chapter 445: Opening the Heaven's Seal

As Luo Tian's hands changed, a terrifying pressure formed in the sky. It seemed like the storm clouds had returned.

Luo Tian dodged while using a new martial art he learned from the Book of Epochs. As his hands changed, the pressure in the sky increased.

"What martial art is this? I feel it contains a hint of heavenly authority! It makes me feel threatened!" Ding Hongfei showed shock on his face, watching the pressure from the sky and exclaiming.
