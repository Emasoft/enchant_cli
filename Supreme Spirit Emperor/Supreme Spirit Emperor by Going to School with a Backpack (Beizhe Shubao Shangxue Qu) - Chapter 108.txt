Without a moment's hesitation, the Heaven-Opening Seal materialized instantly above the elder, halting his movement mid-step and causing him to display astonishment on his face.

Luo Tian's lips curled slightly, his spear "Rending Heaven" in hand, as he unleashed the three techniques of Rending Heaven. The spear pierced through the elder's spiritual energy palm.

"Damn!" The elder growled, his gaze dark as he barked at the hundred Luo family warriors in Bone-Devouring Stage beneath him: "Form the Heaven's Heart Ice Array!"

Chapter 528: Freezing ()

Chapter 528: Freezing

Upon hearing the elder's command, Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly, gazing at the hundred Bone-Devouring Stage warriors on the ground.

"Kill..." As the elder's words faded, the hundred Bone-Devouring Stage warriors let out a low roar. A chilling aura surged skyward, piercing the heavens. Each warrior's body glowed with a faint blue radiance.

In an instant, the Heaven-Opening Seal descended upon the elder, who was already restrained and moving sluggishly.

The elder's face contorted with fear as he swung his fists repeatedly, striking the golden seal.

Yet against this apocalyptic seal, his resistance was as futile as a mayfly challenging a tree.

"Crash..." Under the astonished gazes of all, the golden seal slammed onto the elder's body.

The elder resembled a fly struck by a flyswatter, his entire form hurtling downward toward the earth.

"This youth is truly audacious!" The onlookers' faces bore admiration as they gazed at Luo Tian standing proudly.

Behind Xu Liyi, three elemental forces surged, clashing with another elder. Upon the Heaven-Opening Seal's appearance, both men halted their fight instantly, exchanging glances of shock at the seal.

Meanwhile, Chen Zhanbiao merely glanced at the Heaven-Opening Seal before his face lit up with excitement. He lunged toward the elder he was battling.

"Crash..." Chen Zhanbiao's fist struck, the elder being in the Bone-Devouring Stage's middle realm. He had expected this elder to pause their fight, observing the Heaven-Opening Seal as Xu Liyi and the other elder had done. Yet he hadn't anticipated this youth's unpredictable tactics, leaving him stunned and struck by a punch.

"Spit..." The elder coughed up blood, his face brimming with fury, mirroring the elder struck by the Heaven-Opening Seal as he plummeted toward the earth.

"Three thousand feet... two thousand feet... one thousand foot..." The golden "Heaven's Character" seal carried the elder downward, descending steadily.

The hundred Bone-Devouring Stage warriors on the ground seemed oblivious to the sky's change, shouting "Kill" twice more.

"A hum..." As the third "kill" echoed, an overwhelming chill surged skyward. The hundred warriors began moving rhythmically across the ground.

Upon closer inspection, each warrior's eyes faintly shimmered with snowflakes.

The chill surged skyward, instantly engulfing the two elders and the golden Heaven-Opening Seal.

Their collision triggered a startling transformation that made Luo Tian's eyes narrow, his face etched with intense disbelief.

In his vision, the golden seal rapidly frosted over upon contact with the chilling aura, its descent slowing slightly.

The two elders, however, seemed unaffected, descending slowly toward the ground where they were caught by the hundred Bone-Devouring Stage warriors.

"Crack..." A series of cracking sounds echoed in the ears, and under Luo Tian's astonished gaze, the golden seal finally halted mid-air, losing all its might. It plummeted to the ground, shattering into fragments of ice.

Luo Tian hadn't expected his infallible Heaven-Opening Seal to be defeated by such a combined array. How terrifying must this chill be?

Yet, soon after, Luo Tian felt the chilling intensity's terror. A freezing aura instantly infiltrated his body.

"Damn!" Luo Tian shifted his feet, attempting to escape the chill's range, but was surprised to find his spiritual energy frozen, its circulation painfully slow.

Luo Tian wasn't the only one affected; Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao were also enveloped by this chill.

The frigid city of Xuanbing had plummeted another dozen degrees upon the Heaven's Heart Ice Array's activation, causing ordinary people to shout and flee toward their homes.

"Cough..." The elder struck by Luo Tian's Heaven-Opening Seal, supported by two Bone-Devouring Stage warriors, glared at Luo Tian in the sky with a cold expression.

"Kid, you're truly formidable—especially that seal; even I barely withstood it. But now, you and your two companions will perish from the cold!" The elder spoke, regaining his composure before personally directing the array. The elder struck by Chen Zhanbiao also joined the array with a sinister expression.

With two elders of the Late Stage of Yuanling joining, the world's temperature dropped further. Within the array, Luo Tian felt his spiritual energy frozen nine-tenths, even his surrounding spiritual energy locked in place.

"God, it's so cold!" Chen Zhanbiao shivered, his teeth chattering as he roared.

"Kid, do you feel your strength has dropped too much? Ha!" The remaining elder in the sky sneered at Xu Liyi.

"Damn!" Xu Liyi's face bore a flicker of anger. He had dominated the elder before, but now that the array was activated, though he wasn't at its center, his strength had been suppressed by about three-fifths. Now he was being dominated, barely defending himself. His spiritual energy's circulation had slowed increasingly—soon it would be entirely frozen.

"Kid, how do you feel?" A mocking voice echoed from within the array.

At this moment, Luo Tian's condition had deteriorated to its worst; his spiritual energy was completely frozen. His face bore frost, and a thin chill exhaled with each breath. His spiritual energy wings behind him were gradually encased in frost. If time prolonged, Luo Tian would surely plummet from the sky.

For a moment, the three found themselves in a deadlock—especially Chen Zhanbiao, who had been completely frozen into an ice statue and was slowly descending toward the ground.

"Refining Spirit..." Luo Tian channeled his last remaining unfrozen spiritual energy, flying toward Chen Zhanbiao and retrieving him into the Refining Spirit Bag.

"Son of a bitch!" Seeing Chen Zhanbiao frozen, Xu Liyi cursed loudly, his body radiating boundless power as he shouted profanities.

Strangely, with each of Xu Liyi's curses, his power surged incrementally, making the elder's movements more agile.

Chapter 529: Two Worlds of Ice and Fire ()

Chapter 529: Two Worlds of Ice and Fire

Seeing Xu Liyi's outburst, Luo Tian turned his gaze to him, a brief shock crossing his face.

"Triple-element体质?" Luo Tian's expression bore astonishment—Xu Liyi was a Triple-Element Body.

Even more astonishing was Xu Liyi's elements: wind, fire, and lightning—rare attributes.

The shock lasted only a moment; Luo Tian had no time to ponder further as his spiritual energy was completely frozen, transforming him into a glittering ice statue plummeting toward the ground.

"Luo Tian!" Xu Liyi's face darkened as he watched Luo Tian follow Chen Zhanbiao's fate. He longed to rescue him but was entangled by the Late Stage of Yuanling elder, unable to break free.

"He's falling!" The onlookers watched Luo Tian descending endlessly, their faces bearing admiration and pity for him.

If Luo Tian landed in the hands of the Luo family, considering his earlier assault on their Grand Elder, people could easily guess his fate.

"Hmph..." The Luo family's Grand Elder stood within the array, his face dark as he watched Luo Tian descend.

"Four thousand feet... three thousand feet... two thousand feet..."

Under the people's sighs, Luo Tian fell to two thousand feet. Yet their faces soon bore strange expressions.

Luo Tian, who had been descending endlessly, suddenly halted at two thousand feet above ground. His ice crystals shattered violently, revealing his body.

He opened his eyes; they flashed like lightning, his face radiating cold determination. His hands moved swiftly.

The onlookers were stunned—why had Luo Tian, seemingly frozen, broken free? And why did he appear unharmed?

"What?" The Luo family's Grand Elder also bore disbelief. He knew his Heaven's Heart Ice Array well—no one, not even a Yuanling Peak, had escaped its grasp.

Yet this Yuanling Initial Stage youth had merely been frozen for a moment before breaking free, leaving the three Luo elders in disbelief.

In the people's stunned silence, a green fire dragon erupted from Luo Tian's hands.

As the fire dragon appeared, the sky's temperature seemed less frigid. Wisps of moisture continuously drifted from the fire dragon's body.

"One... ten... a hundred..." Luo Tian released one fire dragon after another, sending them toward the Luo family members operating the array.

"This flame is peculiar!" The Luo Grand Elder's face bore a frown, watching the green fire dragons circling and attacking the Luo family members.

As a hundred fire dragons roared out, the world seemed divided—half frigid, half scorching. It was like ice and fire in two realms.

"Fire-Consuming Heaven's Array!" Luo Tian halted high above, his hands slamming into the void.

"Crash... crash..." The fire dragons exploded above the Luo family members, transforming into emerald sparks that drifted through the sky.

In an instant, a sea of fire consumed the heavens. Overwhelming flames roared forth, turning the sky into an emerald hue. The vast fire sea surged toward the Luo family members still circulating their array.

With the fire's arrival, the world's temperature returned to normal—perhaps even becoming scorching.

"Crash..." The fire sea finally collided with the array's continuous cold aura.

"Sizzle..." White vapor rose from their collision, obscuring the people's vision and even blocking their spiritual senses. The emerald flames isolated them.

One breath... two breaths...

Ten breaths passed in an instant. Luo Tian's face turned pale, ignoring the Luo family members under his Fire-Consuming Heaven's Array. He focused on Xu Liyi's side.

As the temperature fully returned, Xu Liyi regained his normal state. Yet his curses hadn't ceased; he attacked while continuously cursing, making Luo Tian silently pity the elder.

The elder was indeed exasperated—unable to fight and distracted by curses. Moreover, observing the opponent's speed of speech and attack, he was clearly not on the same level.

"Spit..." The elder finally couldn't endure, struck in the chest by Xu Liyi's palm. He spat out old blood—whether from being hit or infuriated by Xu Liyi, it was unclear.

Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with amusement as he flew toward Xu Liyi, smiling: "Alright, we should go now!"

"Right." Xu Liyi nodded slightly. He knew they couldn't truly kill the Luo family members. Killing Luo Haosiu was one thing, but if they killed these three elders, the Ice Pole Island would surely hunt them relentlessly.

Though they hadn't killed anyone, their commotion in Xuanbing City would certainly provoke Ice Pole Island.

Yet Xu Liyi had no regrets. He could sense Luo Tian was trustworthy, a friend he could rely on in life or death. Simply because when Xu Liyi had demanded to extort the Luo family, Luo Tian hadn't hesitated but stood by his side. Xu Liyi had already considered Luo Tian a friend.

That was why, after Luo Tian killed Luo Haosiu, Xu Liyi hadn't left with Chen Zhanbiao.

They clenched their fists and slammed them together, exchanging a glance before laughing wildly.

The people watching them laugh wildly bore admiration and reverence. They turned their gaze to the Luo family members who had revealed themselves.

To their sight, the three Luo elders and the hundred Bone-Devouring Stage warriors all had blood trickling from their mouths, their faces pale and collapsed on the ground.

"Did the Heaven's Heart Ice Array backfire, causing the Luo family to suffer retaliation?" People looked at the Luo family members with confusion before gazing reverently at the two in the sky.

"That old man, I'll return. Remember, you still owe us one million spiritual stones. I'll come back to collect them—prepare early; next time, if you don't give it, it won't be just a wound!" Luo Tian's voice rang out in everyone's ears with arrogance.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, the Luo family members' faces paled further. Since Xuanbing City was established, no one had suffered such heavy losses.

The three elders could foresee that this news would provoke the Ice Pole Island's Luo family direct line. It might even revoke their branch's power to station in Xuanbing City.

Chapter 530: Self-Imprisonment? ()

Chapter 530: Self-Imprisonment?

Thinking of this, the three elders' faces bore intense hatred toward Luo Tian and Xu Liyi. However, their current strength was entirely depleted.

"Kid, today's grudge we'll remember. We'll report this to Ice Pole Island; you'll wait for their endless pursuit!" The elder issued a threat, his face unkind as he gazed at Luo Tian and Xu Liyi.

"Idiot..." Xu Liyi sighed, his gaze looking at the elder like he was a fool.

The surrounding people also mocked the elder's naivety. Clearly, Luo Tian and Xu Liyi either had a massive background to fear Ice Pole Island's retaliation or had immense courage, ready for conflict with Ice Pole Island. If they cared about the elder's threat, they wouldn't have chosen to confront Ice Pole Island in the first place.

With their strength, it was true no one could stop them from leaving.

Seeming to sense his words had issues, seeing the surrounding people and Luo Tian and Xu Liyi's looks of disdain, his face turned red. He spat out another mouthful of blood.

"Alright, old dog, goodbye. Remember to prepare the money next time!" Luo Tian waved at the elder with a smile, exchanging glances with Xu Liyi before vanishing from the spot.

Watching their calm disappearance, the surrounding people sighed. With three people against three Yuanling Stage elders and a hundred Bone-Devouring Stage warriors, they had emerged unscathed. Their combat power was truly terrifying.

People were certain that this incident would spread within days, and when it did, the two would face Ice Pole Island's retaliation.

...

Luo Tian and Xu Liyi, however, were unaware of what the people were thinking. Even if they knew, they would smile slightly, for they had already set off toward Ice Pole Island.

At this moment, Luo Tian revealed his true self, regaining a youthful face and releasing Li Fugui and Chen Zhanbiao.

When Li Fugui heard they were heading toward Ice Pole Island, he nearly wet his pants. But recalling the one million spiritual stones and Luo Tian's assurance that he'd be safe, Li Fugui bit his teeth and trusted Luo Tian once more.

"Luo Tian, don't cheat me! My life isn't worth much!" Li Fugui didn't fully believe Luo Tian's words, asking this question over ten times during their journey.

Even the usually simple Chen Zhanbiao grew impatient with Li Fugui's questions, flying to his side and slapping him on the shoulder so hard he almost disintegrated.

"Can't you stop talking? They won't deceive us!" Chen Zhanbiao grumbled, his gaze on Xu Liyi and Luo Tian.

At this moment, in Chen Zhanbiao's eyes, Luo Tian was nearly at Xu Liyi's level.

Time passed swiftly; two days had gone by.

Luo Tian and his group were only two hours away from Ice Pole Island, but the weather grew increasingly cold as they approached it. Li Fugui could barely withstand the icy chill, shivering in the sky.

Luo Tian sighed and allocated a thread of Emerald Crystal Jade Fire to protect Li Fugui.

Two hours' journey passed quickly with their swift movement, and the four arrived at Ice Pole Island's mountain gate.

A towering ice mountain stood before them, leaving the four in awe. The entire ice emitted a strong chill, a cold aura permeating their hearts.

"This is Ice Pole Island!" Luo Tian's face gleamed with excitement, recalling memories of the Luo family.

"Stop..." As they walked, two voices echoed in Luo Tian's group ears, halting their steps.

In the blizzard, two young men descended from the ice mountain, eyes filled with vigilance as they gazed at Luo Tian's group.

"Who are you? What is your purpose here on Ice Pole Island?" One disciple asked, addressing Luo Tian's group.

Xu Liyi and the others instinctively turned their gazes to Luo Tian, having heard his explanation of their purpose in coming to Ice Pole Island.

Luo Tian smiled slightly, retrieving a token from his storage ring and tossing it to the disciple who appeared to be guarding: "Tell the Luo family members, Luo Tian has returned. I'm sure they'll come out soon!"

The two furrowed their brows, hearing Luo Tian's words—clearly a member of the Luo family. Yet their memories held no such name.

When they saw the token Luo Tian had thrown, their faces changed abruptly, eyes showing a trace of reverence as they bowed to Luo Tian: "Please wait. I'll go report!"

They hurriedly ascended the ice mountain, vanishing into the icy snow.

Seeing their respectful demeanor and attitude, Li Fugui felt at ease, his gaze showing admiration for Luo Tian. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to truly be a member of the Luo family, and his status seemed quite high.

Luo Tian watched their retreating figures, eyes deep with thought, whispering softly: "I wonder who still remembers the old Luo Tian!"

"A hum..." Soon after, spiritual energy fluctuations echoed. A cheerful laugh resounded from the mountain top, a senior elder descending with several people from the ice mountain.

"Is it you, Tian? I never thought you'd return from the dead! Ha!"
The elder's laughter was filled with excitement, shaking the entire mountain.

Seeing the descending elder, Luo Tian's eyes lit up, recalling who he was. He knelt respectfully before the elder.

"Luo Tian, greetings, Second Grandfather!" Luo Tian's face bore admiration, recalling the little girl who was this elder's granddaughter—his older sister.

Seeing Luo Tian's youthful appearance, the elder's eyes moistened. Due to certain reasons, he had once been cold toward Luo Tian, sending his underage granddaughter to protect him. Yet the young Luo Tian had eventually died, causing the elder great sorrow and a sense of guilt toward his older brother, Luo Xiong.

Now seeing Luo Tian recognize him and kneel before him, the elder pulled him up, face showing a trace of guilt: "You've suffered these years. Come, Second Grandfather will take you home!"

Seeing the elder's affectionate gaze, Luo Tian's eyes moistened. He knew this elder was his grandfather's younger brother, Luo Zhan.

For years, he had singlehandedly supported the Luo Xiong lineage. Without him, perhaps the Luo Xiong lineage would have already been expelled from Ice Pole Island.

Luo Tian also learned from his parents that the elder's coldness toward him had its unavoidable hardships. Luo Tian had never blamed this man.

Chapter 531: Genius Sister ()

Chapter 531: Genius Sister

Luo Tian was warmly welcomed onto Ice Pole Island by Luo Zhan, while Xu Liyi and the others followed behind him, observing Ice Pole Island's scenery.

As for those middle-aged men and youths led down by Luo Zhan, they gazed at Luo Tian with hostility and even resentment. These gazes did not escape Luo Tian's notice, but he said nothing, his eyes showing a trace of coldness.

Feeling Luo Tian's chill, Luo Zhan glanced at the people around him, understanding immediately. His inner heart sighed, transmitting to Luo Tian: "These are all our lineage people. For years, they've resented the fact that you left, causing our lineage to decline!"

"Hmph. People who only rely on others—when they fall, they blame others. Ha! Such people aren't worthy of being my Luo Tian's elders!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed cold, memorizing these people's faces.

Not long after, Luo Tian and his group reached the top of the ice mountain. To their surprise, there was no chill at all—instead, it was lush with greenery, leaving them amazed.

The surrounding Luo family disciples saw Luo Zhan and their faces slightly startled before bowing respectfully, but Luo Tian could tell they weren't sincere. They merely gave a token bow before returning to their tasks.

"Ah..." Seeing this, Luo Zhan's face bore a trace of bitterness, but it quickly faded.
This brief bitterness did not escape Luo Tian's eyes, making him sigh inwardly. He hadn't expected their lineage had reached such a state.

Luo Zhan was of the same generation as his grandfather. By lineage, he was extremely high-ranking. Yet these disciples treated him so disrespectfully. Luo Zhan was currently the leader of their lineage, yet he was treated this way—imagine what other members of their lineage endured.

After passing through numerous buildings, Luo Zhan and his group finally reached a secluded courtyard. Through Luo Zhan's introduction, this courtyard and surrounding areas were their lineage's residence.

Luo Tian glanced around briefly—only a few hundred rooms, meaning his lineage now had only hundreds remaining on Ice Pole Island. The rest were distributed across the southern regions, managing Ice Pole Island's industries.

A few hundred households was already sparse for a large family. Luo Tian hadn't expected their lineage had declined so much.

As Luo Zhan entered his residence's hall, a group of people awaited there. The atmosphere in the hall was somber. Upon Luo Zhan and his group entering, everyone turned their gaze to him.

"Family Head!" Everyone stood up, bowing respectfully, faces showing reverence toward Luo Zhan.

Luo Zhan had done much for their lineage over the years. People saw this, and even those with wolf-like hearts would respect this man who had singlehandedly supported the family.

"Sit down, everyone. I'm sure you've guessed who this young man is! Yes, he's the grandson of my older brother, the son of Nan Tian—Luo Tian!" Luo Zhan spoke to the people around him.

Upon hearing Luo Zhan's introduction, the surrounding people's gazes darkened. Some showed indifference as if they hadn't heard, others bore traces of resentment.

"For years, our lineage has had no young family head. Today, Luo Tian's return means he is suitable for the position of young family head. I hereby declare that from today, Luo Tian shall be our lineage's young family head!" Seeing the people's silence, Luo Zhan didn't mind and continued.

"Boom..." As Luo Zhan's words fell, the previously silent hall suddenly erupted into chaos. People gathered in groups, discussing loudly.

"Family Head, I think this is inappropriate. This child is still young and has just returned to the family—appointing him as young family head so quickly might cause the younger members to be不服!"

"Yes, it's too hasty!"

"This is definitely not feasible! If it weren't for their father and grandfather's departure, our lineage wouldn't have declined to this point!" Soon after, people erupted into a cacophony of opposition.

Hearing the loud opposition, Luo Zhan's face darkened. He slammed his hand on the table: "You just argue about this matter. How many years have they been away? How has our lineage survived these years? You always blame others—have you considered your own flaws?"

"I'm certain that even if they hadn't left, our lineage would have gradually declined!" Luo Zhan spoke loudly, clearly angry. The hall fell into silence immediately.

"Family Head, I think Qingqing should be the young family head instead. Her strength is outstanding within our family and even across Ice Pole Island—no one would object!" A senior spoke, his gaze solemn.

Hearing the elder's words, others nodded in agreement, their faces showing approval.

"Lu Qingqing?" Luo Tian's face bore a trace of smile, recalling the little girl who had once cried and stood before him to defend him.

Luo Tian hadn't expected this little girl had become a genius known by all.

"Second Grandfather, the elders are right. Returning home so soon and appointing me as young family head is indeed inappropriate. The elders' words are reasonable—let Qingqing's sister be the young family head!" Luo Tian smiled, bowing to Luo Zhan. Then he subtly sent a voice imprint into Luo Zhan's mind.

Luo Tian's body trembled slightly, then he glanced at Luo Zhan and nodded slightly: "Alright, since you don't desire the young family head position, we'll temporarily set it aside."

"Still has self-awareness!" A middle-aged man spoke, his face showing mockery.

"Smack..." But before the middle-aged man finished speaking, Luo Tian's figure appeared in front of him. He slapped him away.

"Crash..." The middle-aged man flew backward, his face showing disbelief as he gazed at Luo Tian standing there, eyes coldly watching him. He instinctively shivered.

"Rude! Since you don't consider me family, I won't regard you as such. Who dares to be disrespectful toward me will not just face a slap. Don't use elders to intimidate me—I don't accept this!" Luo Tian's voice was like a cold wind, stirring the hearts of all.

Chapter 532: Seclusion and Advancement ()

Chapter 532: Seclusion and Advancement

Luo Tian's action left the entire hall in an instant of silence, everyone's faces showing disbelief at Luo Tian.

"Disobedient!"
"Dare!" The people in the hall shouted, their gazes filled with hostility toward Luo Tian as if they had found his weakness.

Yet their hearts bore a trace of fear. Over the years, with their lineage's decline, their overall strength had plummeted to its lowest point. They relied solely on Luo Zhan's Yuanling Peak to hold it together. Others were merely Yuanling Initial or Middle Stage, with no one reaching Yuanling Late Stage.

Even in this hall, there was a person at Bone-Devouring Peak—showing how far Luo Xiong's lineage had declined.

Luo Tian's ability to slap a Yuanling Initial Stage middle-aged man away meant his strength was at least Yuanling Middle Stage or higher. This made them take him seriously.

"Who has an issue with this?" Luo Tian's gaze swept around, looking at the people glaring at him.

"Kid, don't overstep! Think you have some talent and dare to run wild on Ice Pole Island!" Someone in the crowd shouted again, their gaze filled with hostility.

"Smack..." In an instant, Luo Tian's figure appeared in front of the shouting middle-aged man. He slapped him again and returned to his original position.

Seeing Luo Tian's actions, Luo Zhan's eyes gleamed with pride. His thoughts were clear—this was indeed his older brother's grandson, but his eyes bore anger: "Alright, that's enough. Luo Tian, come with me to your residence and settle in first!"

"Yes..." Luo Tian bowed respectfully. His attitude made a complete 180-degree turn, as if nothing had happened. He wore the image of a well-behaved child.

Under the stunned gazes, Luo Tian followed Luo Zhan out of the hall.

As they exited, the hall erupted into discussions again. Everyone's faces bore admiration for Luo Tian's strength, matching that of his grandfather and father.

The two who had been slapped bore cold gazes toward Luo Tian's retreating back before leaving the hall in disgrace.

...

Luo Zhan and Luo Tian exited, accompanied by Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao who had been waiting outside impatiently. They headed toward other courtyards.

Li Fugui, upon entering Ice Pole Island, had gone to deliver news to the island.

Along the way, Luo family members gazed at Luo Zhan with respect, but they didn't know who these three young men were. They were confused, only a few recognizing that one of them was once Luo Tian and thus bore slight hostility.

"Hopeless!" Luo Zhan's face bore a trace of bitterness, seeing the Luo family like this. He sighed softly.

Seeing Luo Zhan's bitter expression, Luo Tian sighed as well. How could this family resemble a main branch? Even if they returned to Ice Pole Island, there was little hope.

"See this? This family has weakened over the years; these people have lost their will."
"Still, our next generation—this group of young people—has produced a few promising talents!" Luo Zhan spoke bitterly, then thought of Lu Qingqing and this generation's youth. His face bore a trace of hope.

Luo Tian nodded slightly, speaking softly: "The Luo family now needs spirit and morale—raising morale could revive the old pride of the Luo family!"

Hearing this, Luo Zhan's body trembled. He looked at Luo Tian, surprised that a young man had seen through the elders' issues more clearly. Yet he sighed and continued: "Although this is true, there's no one who can do it."

"Qingqing is good, but she's a girl. There are several promising talents, but they're merely good—still slightly behind true geniuses!" Luo Zhan spoke bitterly, leading Luo Tian to a relatively spacious courtyard.

"Alright, you'll stay here temporarily. If there's anything, come find me!" Luo Zhan spoke, his face showing affection as he gently patted Luo Tian's shoulder.

Luo Tian bowed respectfully, his face showing a faint sigh. His gaze was deep as he looked at Luo Zhan's hunched form.

Luo Zhan was a Yuanling Peak strength, yet he had already begun to hunch. This showed the immense pressure he had endured over these years.

"This old man is very strong!" Chen Zhanbiao grumbled, gazing at Luo Zhan's retreating figure with vigilance.

"Hmm?" Hearing Chen Zhanbiao speak, Luo Tian and Xu Liyi were puzzled. Especially Xu Liyi, who had never heard Chen Zhanbiao say someone was strong—only when he met Luo Tian did he not say he was strong.

"I just feel he's very strong, but I'm not sure!" Seeing their gazes on him, Chen Zhanbiao felt a bit embarrassed.

Luo Tian thought for a moment and nodded slightly. He also had a feeling that his second grandfather, Luo Zhan, was not as simple as he appeared. Yuanling Peak strength was powerful in the outside world, but on Ice Pole Island, it was unlikely to intimidate other lineage members.

"Regardless of his special methods, he's still my second grandfather and family. Since I've returned now, some things can't be left for him to bear alone!" Luo Tian's face bore determination. He turned into the room.

"Ah... this period will be very boring!" Xu Liyi's face showed a sigh, yawning as he entered another room.
