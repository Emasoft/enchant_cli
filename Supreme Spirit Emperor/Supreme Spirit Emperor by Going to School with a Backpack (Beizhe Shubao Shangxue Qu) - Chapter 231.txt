“Ah…” a pitiful cry echoed through the storm, as the lone cultivator had just formed a human shape but hadn’t yet reacted before being instantly annihilated by the storm, meeting his end.

Luo Tian’s combat prowess was unmatched. Though his cultivation had not advanced within the ancient celestial palace, his techniques were terrifyingly formidable—especially his "Buddha’s Heaven Attack Art," which he had mastered to perfection. Fivefold increased attack power made his martial arts devastating, allowing him to crush a saint in the middle stage who had suffered core damage.

“Kill!” Luo Tian ignored the lone cultivator torn apart by the spear storm and turned his gaze toward another saint in the late stage, who was slowly coalescing into form.

“Open Heaven!” His hands moved swiftly, golden light slicing through the starry void like a meteor, instantly crushing the lone cultivator before him.

“Crack…” A shattering sound echoed as the cultivator was reduced to a pile of flesh, scattered across the starry void.

If anyone had been present, they would have been stunned—three late-stage saints, one dead instantly, two severely wounded and on the verge of collapse.

“Over there! There’s a powerful martial technique!” As two lone cultivators were slowly forming their bodies, a voice echoed into Luo Tian’s perception, causing him to frown slightly as he prepared to strike.

“Their pursuit is surprisingly swift!” Luo Tian sighed, his gaze falling upon the two who had formed human shapes but whose cultivation had dropped to the early stage, their faces filled with terror.

“I’ll let you two off for now!” Luo Tian’s feet sent ripples through the air, and with a step of the Yin Yang Ghost Step, he vanished from sight.

“Terrifying…” The two cultivators with diminished power bore expressions of terror; Luo Tian’s strength had completely surpassed their understanding of early-stage saints.

“Stay calm and decisive!” Since the three late-stage saints had appeared, Luo Tian had single-handedly suppressed them with his bow alone, leaving no chance for retaliation. If not for the arrival of others, they would have surely perished.

“Where is he? Luo Tian, hand over the Epoch Bell!” A figure materialized as waves of power surged forth, appearing before the two lone cultivators.

“They’ve reborn through blood!” Observers noted the pale faces of the two lone cultivators and realized they had formed bodies through blood rebirth.

“They are the three late-stage saints who chased Luo Tian!” Someone finally recognized them, their faces filled with shock.

Three late-stage saints surrounding Luo Tian had been slain by him, and two were reduced to the early stage—how terrifying was Luo Tian?

“Damn it, he’s supposed to be in the early stage! How could he be this strong!” A middle-stage saint trembled with fear, shouting.

A crowd arrived in waves, drawn by the sight of three late-stage saints’ tragic forms. Each felt fear and halted their pursuit.

“He possesses a pseudo-epoch treasure, and it’s not just one!” One of the lone cultivators sighed, addressing the crowd.

“Moreover, he has a bow—the same pseudo-epoch treasure from the auction. With just three arrows, it nearly killed us all; we couldn’t even defend against it. And his saint energy seems endless, as if using the pseudo-epoch treasure cost him nothing. That’s the most critical factor!” Another lone cultivator spoke with bitterness, recalling Luo Tian’s terrifying power and vowing never to trouble him again.

“Hiss…” The crowd inhaled sharply, their faces filled with fear. Though they found it hard to believe, the facts were before them—three saints, one dead and two wounded. A saint in the early stage had slain them with a pseudo-epoch treasure.

Chapter 1009: Encirclement and Pursuit

Beneath the starry void, countless figures stirred, gazing at two pale-faced elders who dared not pursue further. Luo Tian’s bloodstained reality had informed them that seizing treasures required the cost of blood.

A saint in the early stage slaying a late-stage saint—such an achievement was beyond absurd. Without a saint in the peak stage, who could challenge Luo Tian with his Heaven-Striking Bow?

“Hearing that Luo Tian also possesses a defensive pseudo-epoch treasure, which is equally terrifying. A few days ago, Elder He of the Crane Clan had surrounded him within it, and Luo Tian killed him with two arrows, reducing him to the early stage before he bled out in their hands.”

“Enough. Life is still important; I’m just a middle-stage saint, so I’ll give up!” The crowd gradually dispersed, but some remained unwilling, chasing after Luo Tian’s path.

At that moment, Luo Tian walked through the starry void, once again assuming a Daoist’s appearance. The entire demon domain now buzzed with news of Luo Tian, making him known across the nine domains.

“Feng Jiutian, your suffering hasn’t ended yet!” Luo Tian overheard the murmurs of people, his eyes flashing coldly as he gazed toward the city of saints.

After several days of investigation, Luo Tian had fully understood that all his information was now known to others. There was no need to guess—Feng Jiutian must have spread the news upon returning to the city of saints.

With his speed, Luo Tian could have reached the entrance to the Fire Domain in days, but along the way, others inevitably discovered his trail. He fought relentlessly, pushing forward slowly toward the Fire Domain’s entrance.

As Luo Tian continued his bloodshed, people fully understood his terror—two more late-stage saints had fallen to his Heaven-Striking Bow, and several middle-stage saints were slain in battle.

Instantly, Luo Tian became an enemy of the world, and tales of his invincibility among peers spread wildly. Even major sanctuaries sent their disciples to kill Luo Tian—first, to seize his two pseudo-epoch treasures, and second, to prove their own strength as true masters.

“Want to kill me? Then be ready to be killed!” Luo Tian shouted into the void, challenging all major sanctuaries. His words incited madness among people, and more sought to kill Luo Tian, gathering in the demon domain to hunt him.

Luo Tian fought relentlessly, his prowess unmatched. His Yin Yang Ghost Step and teleportation techniques were perfected, but he was eventually cornered on an uninhabited planet.

His robes stained with blood, Luo Tian’s eyes showed exhaustion from relentless battles. Though his saint energy had not waned, his mind was drained. This was the result of reaching the pinnacle of his cultivation; a regular early-stage saint would have already broken under such relentless pursuit.

Luo Tian stood on an open land, gazing at the hundreds surrounding him—some in the early stage, some in the middle, and even a few daring superiors attempting to profit from chaos.

He planted his spear into the ground, eyes coldly smiling: “Come then! If you want to seize treasures, ask my crackling spear first!”

People took a step back, hesitating as they gazed at Luo Tian with solemnity. After all, his record was terrifying.

These days, three late-stage saints had died at Luo Tian’s hands, and three more had been reduced to the middle stage with their souls shattered.

“Luo Tian, hand over the two pseudo-epoch treasures and we’ll let you go. We’re lone cultivators, not sects; there’s no grudge between us!” A late-stage saint spoke from the crowd.

“Impossible! This boy has killed countless; he must be slain!” A hidden strength in the void spoke, its voice ethereal and indistinct.

Luo Tian’s eyes held contempt as he gazed into the void, sensing several formidable fluctuations. “All those from major sanctuaries and clans—do you dare hide your faces? How cowardly!”

“Boy, don’t be so mouthy. Today is your day of death!” Another voice from the void spoke, clearly a late-stage saint.

They truly dared not reveal their faces; after all, Cao Yuanshan had declared that anyone who attacked Luo Tian would not be spared.

Previously, some had tried to attack the Yin Yang Ghost Fox Clan to capture Gu Lei and force Luo Tian’s compliance, but all were crushed by Cao Yuanshan. From that moment on, people knew Cao Yuanshan truly wished to protect Luo Tian—a half-step epoch-stage powerhouse’s wrath was enough to make even major sanctuaries cautious, though it wouldn’t destroy them entirely. Still, it would cost their foundations dearly.

“Cowards!” Luo Tian’s face curled into a smile as he pulled his Heaven-Striking Bow from his back, eyes filled with ruthless intent. Now, Luo Tian could still unleash nine arrows; he needed to intimidate others. Only the Heaven-Striking Bow could instill fear in them.

“Crack…” Purple lightning flashed in Luo Tian’s eyes, his violet-tinged gaze scanning the void for the hidden figure.

“I’ve found you!” He drew his bow, aiming at a vague phoenix silhouette in the void.

“Then let’s start with your Feng Clan! Since Feng Jiutian isn’t here, I’ll kill one of your late-stage saints!” Luo Tian’s cold voice sent shivers through the crowd.

People retreated thousands of feet, for the Heaven-Striking Bow’s recent fame had made them wary. Even late-stage saints could bleed out under it; they feared Luo Tian might accidentally kill one, which would be too costly.

“Hmph! A rabble!” Luo Tian’s eyes sneered; these people had no courage. They hoped others would exhaust Luo Tian’s bow draws.

People weren’t foolish; though the Heaven-Striking Bow was terrifying, they knew Luo Tian couldn’t endlessly draw it. He must have used some secret method to limit the number of draws, relying on others to drain his strength. But no one wanted to be the target—death was certain.

“Buzz…” A flash of cold light, immense pressure swirling through the stars, vanished in Luo Tian’s hands. At the same time, a scream echoed from the void, followed by thunderous explosions that shattered the stars. A mist of blood appeared in their sight.

“Feng Clan’s scum! I’ll take your life!” Luo Tian shouted, revealing the opponent’s identity. His figure flickered as a golden storm burst from his hands, rushing toward the blood mist.

“Annihilation!” The blood mist hadn’t even fully recovered before it was annihilated by Luo Tian’s spear technique.

“Terrifying!” People trembled, their faces filled with fear as the superiors who had sought to profit fled from this uninhabited star.

“Come then! Kill me, and these two pseudo-epoch treasures will be yours!” Luo Tian radiated golden light, like an invincible god. His spear danced as he advanced without retreat, believing only bloodshed could intimidate this crowd. He flickered toward the hundreds of strongholds.

“He didn’t use the Heaven-Striking Bow; did he exhaust his saint energy?” People saw Luo Tian reattach the bow to his back, their faces lighting up with joy.

“His strength is waning!” They saw Luo Tian’s bloodied body and concluded he could no longer draw the bow. All raised their weapons, unleashing martial arts toward Luo Tian.

“Dong…” The bell’s sound echoed as a golden bell image enveloped Luo Tian. The terrifying martial arts of hundreds of late-stage saints struck the bell’s body.

“Boom…” The combined power of hundreds of late-stage saints was terrifying, shaking the land beneath them until it exploded into dust, forcing people to stand in the void.

“Puke…” The immense pressure, even blocked by the Epoch Bell, made Luo Tian spit blood.

The cost for people was that several early-stage saints were slain by Luo Tian’s close combat, torn apart.

The crowd erupted into chaos as the battle began. Their target was Luo Tian, protected by the Epoch Bell.

Luo Tian stood beneath the bell, impervious to all attacks. His spear continuously stirred the stars, his martial arts falling like rain. He danced through the void with Yin Yang Ghost Step, fighting relentlessly against them.

Blood fell from the sky as more late-stage saints were slain by Luo Tian. Some died instantly, while others reborn through blood but were annihilated by the collision of attacks in the void.

In the void, several late-stage saints hid, sensing Luo Tian’s ferocity. Their hearts trembled; these were all major sanctuaries who had hidden their true faces, sent to kill Luo Tian. But after Luo Tian killed that Feng Clan saint, people knew he still had the strength to draw the Heaven-Striking Bow.

Luo Tian was like a devil from hell, the Epoch Bell protecting him and greatly weakening their attacks. Yet his results were astonishing—each step forward killed a late-stage saint.

Bloodstained slaughter made people shiver, but for the pseudo-epoch treasures, it was worth the risk. After all, Luo Tian was alone, and even with the treasure’s protection, he would eventually fall.

“Enter madness!” Luo Tian roared, like a demon king reborn. His seven demonic blades slashed repeatedly, killing two more early-stage saints.

Time passed slowly; Luo Tian fought like a machine, tireless and relentless, taking countless lives.

Two fists against four legs—after three days of slaughter, Luo Tian was exhausted and once again surrounded.

Chapter 1010: Enemies Arrive

In the endless starry void of the demon domain, bloodstained aura continuously spread. Luo Tian stood within the Epoch Bell, mercilessly slaughtering those who sought to seize it and the Heaven-Striking Bow. His eyes were red with blood, his first time truly seeing red. If he didn’t kill them, he would become one of them.

Luo Tian did not want to die; there were still many things he needed to do. Violence was the fundamental solution, and now he deeply understood this truth.

Though his eyes were red with blood, others weren’t. Seeing Luo Tian like a god of war, they finally trembled and retreated, afraid of his black demonic blades.

“Come on!” As people fell back, Luo Tian instantly regained clarity, gazing at the remaining hundred or so who surrounded him. He shouted confidently.

With one person, he had slaughtered hundreds of late-stage saints. Today’s battle solidified Luo Tian’s fame and made these people give up chasing him, too terrified to continue.

Cracks slowly healed; even a pseudo-epoch treasure had cracks from this slaughter, showing how powerful their attacks were. Without the Epoch Bell, Luo Tian would have died countless times already.

“Buzz…” The Epoch Bell transformed into a bell hanging on Luo Tian’s body again. Bloodied and battered, he appeared in people’s sight.

Even with the Epoch Bell’s protection, Luo Tian had suffered severe injuries; no part of his body was unscathed. His blood was all his own.

“Still coming? If not, then leave!” Luo Tian sneered, his aura still unrelenting. He tightly gripped the crackling spear, blood dripping down its length.

People weren’t angry at Luo Tian’s words; instead, they showed reverence, having earned his respect through strength.

“Luo Tian, if you don’t die, I’ll pledge allegiance to you!” A middle-stage saint spoke loudly, his eyes filled with deep respect. He could sense that if Luo Tian lived, he might enter the epoch stage or even higher.

“No need!” Luo Tian coldly refused, his eyes filled with contempt. He gazed into the void, knowing that was his true enemy—late-stage saints from major sanctuaries and clans.

“Come out! Now that I’m like this, you still fear it?” Luo Tian’s face bore contempt. How could late-stage saints need others to drain him before seeking trouble?

“Boy, two pseudo-epoch treasures. You can’t protect them. Even if you return to the Fire Domain, you won’t save it; you’ll only bring endless disaster!” Five elders slowly appeared before the crowd, their bodies radiating late-stage saint energy.

“Haha, let me guess who you are from!” Luo Tian didn’t answer the elders’ words but scanned them with violet light.

People who had intended to leave stopped, their faces filled with disdain as they gazed at the five elders. They clearly looked down on these five, who were merely used as expendables to drain Luo Tian’s strength.

“You’re from the Divine Clan, aren’t you?” Luo Tian looked at an elder radiating divine light and spoke softly, making the elder’s face twitch slightly before he shook his head.

“You’re from the Demon Clan… You’re from the Shura Domain, you’re from the demon domain’s Dragon Clan!” Luo Tian identified each elder’s origin, making them all flinch.

“Hmph! You’re really… not… ashamed!” Luo Tian smiled carelessly, emphasizing the words “not ashamed.”

“Boy, who we are doesn’t matter. You’re already at your limit; hand over the Heaven-Striking Bow and Epoch Bell, and you might live. Otherwise, you won’t even leave the demon domain!” One elder, clearly angered by Luo Tian’s revelation of his identity, scolded him.

“Haha, are you sure I’m at my limit?” Luo Tian’s body radiated green light, healing his injuries as he gazed at the five elders.

“Those who don’t want to die, get far away! Today I’ll kill five late-stage saints!” Luo Tian shouted at the crowd, making their hearts freeze. They all flew away in panic.

“Boy, what other tricks do you have? The Heaven-Striking Bow is useful against ordinary late-stage saints, but it only threatens one of us. Do you think others will give you another chance?” The Dragon Clan’s late-stage saint elder spoke coldly, his voice laced with disdain.

“You don’t speak! Without using cultivation, I can kill you!” Luo Tian’s eyes held contempt as he spoke to the elder.

“Haha!” The Dragon Clan elder looked at Luo Tian like a fool, his eyes filled with mockery.

“Just because you’re a small fish, if not for the Heaven-Striking Bow and Epoch Bell, what are you? Daring to kill me!” The Dragon Clan’s late-stage saint elder scolded.

“I am your Dragon Ancestor Long Zhan’s brother. By rank, you should call me ancestor!” Luo Tian smiled playfully, gazing at the elder.

“Haha, Long Xuanyang, don’t let a junior provoke you. After all, he’s a late-stage saint. A junior wants to kill you without using the Heaven-Striking Bow and Epoch Bell; why not grant him his wish!” The Shura Domain elder smiled, addressing the Dragon Clan elder.

“Fine, I’ll grant you. Come on, let’s see what tricks you have!” The Dragon Clan elder showed impatience, gazing at Luo Tian.

“This is what you said; don’t regret it!” Luo Tian’s voice was playful as he gazed at the elder, his eyes flashing coldly.

“Haha, you’re giving me face and I’m taking it! Don’t talk nonsense. I’ll see what qualifications you have to be the brother of the Dragon Ancestor. The Reincarnation Body is indeed powerful, but before it grows, you’re nothing—just a small ant I can crush anytime!” The Dragon Clan elder looked down on Luo Tian, speaking loudly.

“Good!” Luo Tian flickered, his body emitting roaring dragon cries as he instantly appeared before the Dragon Clan elder.

“Hiss…” The surrounding people’s faces showed disbelief; they hadn’t expected Luo Tian to dare confront a late-stage saint of the Dragon Clan. After all, that was a late-stage saint from the Dragon Clan—far stronger than ordinary lone cultivators.

The other four late-stage saints showed interest but didn’t attack; if they did, Luo Tian would surely use the Heaven-Striking Bow. Letting the Dragon Clan elder deal with Luo Tian was their preference.

The Dragon Clan elder also felt joy; he hadn’t expected Luo Tian to dare attack him without using the pseudo-epoch treasures. If he killed Luo Tian now, both pseudo-epoch treasures would be his. Then, with his strength, he could escape the four’s pursuit. After all, this was the demon domain.

“Buzz…” But in an instant, a thunderous dragon roar made the Dragon Clan elder stunned.

Luo Tian flicked his finger, two beams of light—blue and red—rose into the air, instantly appearing above the Dragon Clan elder.

“Roar…” The sound of dragon and phoenix harmonized in the starry void, distant yet overwhelming. People’s hearts trembled at the powerful aura.

“Is it blood essence? Whose blood essence is so strong!” People’s faces showed disbelief as they gazed at the two droplets of blood manifesting dragon and phoenix shadows.

“Dragon Ancestor and Phoenix Ancestor’s blood essence!” The Dragon Clan elder was stunned, sensing the immense pressure. Though the Dragon Ancestor and Phoenix Ancestor had been dead for years, they were half-epoch-stage masters. Their blood essence was the essence of life; unless facing their final limit, it would be terrifying.

Just two droplets of blood had already overwhelmed the Dragon Clan elder, his eyes filled with fear.

At the same time, Luo Tian’s hands moved swiftly again, two droplets of golden saint blood flying from his hands and merging with the two droplets above.

“Buzz…” The light intensified; after merging with Luo Tian’s blood, the two droplets transformed again. A golden dragon appeared like Long Jie’s true form, roaring toward the Dragon Clan elder.

A phoenix named Fire Red also gradually solidified, flying toward the Dragon Clan elder.

A low sound echoed; in an instant, two blood holes appeared on the Dragon Clan elder’s forehead. His eyes were vacant, his gaze still frozen in that state.

“Puke… puke…” The two droplets of blood, as if alive, continuously moved through the Dragon Clan elder’s body. Each time they appeared, they took most of his life essence.

His vitality was vanishing; in a moment, the Dragon Clan elder turned into a pile of bones, which Luo Tian kicked with his foot, scattering them into the endless starry void.

“This is… Blood Cultivation!” The Shura Domain’s late-stage saint elder showed disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian.

“How do you have this technique!” The Shura Domain elder spoke angrily, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Oh, is this Blood Cultivation? I just found out. I’ll believe you if you say it’s something I picked up!” Luo Tian smiled, his voice filled with contempt as he gazed into the void.

“Come out then! Since you’ve arrived, don’t hide anymore. You’re at this point; what’s the use of hiding!” Luo Tian shouted into the void, his voice filled with impatience.

Chapter 1011: Celestial Punishment of All Realms

Beneath the endless starry void of the demon domain, Luo Tian was bloodied, his face smiling as he gazed into the void, his eyes filled with coldness.

“Boy, how do you have Blood Cultivation!” The Shura Domain’s late-stage saint elder showed disbelief, speaking to Luo Tian.

“My tricks are many; you’ll experience them soon!” Luo Tian stood beneath the starry void, smiling as he spoke into the void: “Familiar aura. Come out; since you’ve arrived, don’t hide anymore!”

“More people?” The crowd who had been stunned by Luo Tian’s slaughter looked into the void, surprised to find more hidden figures.

A sound of breaking through space echoed as four figures appeared before the crowd, their faces obscured by black veils. Their bodies radiated blood energy, eyes cold and merciless as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“They are the four late-stage saints who stole the Epoch Book fragment in the auction!” Someone recognized them, their faces filled with fear.

“They haven’t returned to the Shura Domain yet; how bold they are!” People murmured, their voices filled with admiration.

To openly hunt in the demon domain and remain there was no small feat.

“Luo Tian, hand over the Epoch Book fragment!” The cold voice showed no emotion, speaking to Luo Tian without even looking at the four late-stage saints.

The Shura Domain’s elder looked at the four with respect; he was a lone cultivator from the Shura Domain, while the four were true disciples of the Shura Domain’s main force. They had emerged from the mysterious Shura City.

Shura City, the most mysterious land in the Shura Domain, had never been found by anyone. Only at specific times would people from Shura City suddenly appear to find promising youths and bring them into the city.

The most powerful aspect of Shura City was its assassination and concealment techniques; no one could escape Shura City’s assassins. Once targeted by Shura City, a person was declared dead. Legends said that within Shura City was the skeleton of an epoch-stage master whose blood had been drained—this was the enemy slain by Shura City’s founder, who entered through killing.

That epoch was one of the darkest in the nine domains; people would shudder at the mention of the Shura Domain, which had reached its peak. Even the powerful冥域 (Nether Region) would avoid Shura City’s master.

The four faces were cold; Luo Tian had obtained the Epoch Book that Shura Domain had desperately sought. This news spread across the nine domains, and they had remained hidden in the demon domain, hearing it. Upon hearing this news, they hadn’t chosen to leave.

They had lost three of their own for the Epoch Book; how could they swallow this? They had waited for an opportunity to strike, but Luo Tian had discovered them.

“More people?” Luo Tian ignored their threats and gazed into the distance, his smile undiminished.

“Haha, Luo Tian, do you remember us?” A deep laugh echoed as thunderous sounds followed. A massive chariot crushed space, flying toward them from the distance.

“Scorpion!” Luo Tian’s eyes darkened as he gazed at three men on the ancient chariot, their eyes filled with killing intent—three of the Scorpion’s leaders who had almost been killed by Luo Tian.

Gray energy radiated from their bodies, and the ancient chariot carried overwhelming pressure, as if it could crush everything. Its might was terrifying.

“Indeed, the infamous marauders Scorpion!” Someone spoke, their voice filled with awe. They secretly marveled at Luo Tian’s enemies—truly reaching the point of being an enemy of the world.

But the three didn’t draw Luo Tian’s attention; though they had advanced to the middle stage, their threat was minimal. What made Luo Tian’s eyes tense was the old man behind them in gray robes.

At the moment the old man appeared, Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed sharply because he was too familiar—unforgettable.

“Nether Region Nine Saints!” Luo Tian softly spoke the words, gazing at the old man in gray robes, his eyes filled with fear.

“Boy, it’s been a long time. I didn’t expect you to survive; that old immortal truly had some skills!” The gray-robed elder smiled, radiating the aura of a peak-stage saint. Though he was smiling, the coldness in his aura made Luo Tian tremble.

“Peak-stage saint!” The crowd gasped, their eyes filled with fear as they gazed at the elder.

“Finally, a peak-stage saint has acted!”

“Wait… Luo Tian said he was from the Nether Region Nine Saints. Does that mean they’re from the Nether Region?” People murmured, gazing at the elder with shock.

“Is the Nether Region about to emerge again?” People’s eyes showed fear, recalling the chaos after each emergence of the Nether Region.

“Boy, hand over the Epoch Book to me; don’t make me do it myself! For the old immortal’s sake, I might let you die painlessly!” The elder smiled without changing expression, speaking to Luo Tian.

“Your mother!” Luo Tian’s heart trembled; he hadn’t expected to lure such a big fish, which was beyond his expectations.

“Wan Lingkong, don’t betray me!” Luo Tian’s heart trembled, recalling Wan Lingkong’s confident expression when he had entrusted him with a set of array flags.

“Luo Tian, don’t worry; this array was created by my ancestor. I’ve understood it these days. Once unleashed, it will kill gods and destroy Buddhas! Even a peak-stage saint won’t escape being turned to dust!” Wan Lingkong smiled confidently, patting Luo Tian’s shoulder and vowing.

Without this array, Luo Tian wouldn’t have dared to openly lure everyone here; he would have fled long ago.

But Luo Tian had wanted to lure all his enemies and destroy them at once, but he hadn’t expected to lure a peak-stage saint—specifically the ninth of the Nether Region Nine Saints.

Luo Tian clearly remembered the old man’s power; even though he had entered the early stage, he knew he couldn’t match one slap from him. Even a peak-stage saint wouldn’t be the old man’s opponent.

“Hmph? You’ve been suppressed by Heaven, unable to cultivate higher?” The old man, who had lived countless years, noticed Luo Tian’s condition and showed interest.

“Since you’ve been suppressed by Heaven, living is a waste. I heard you’re a Reincarnation Body; I didn’t expect that. My eyes are failing!”

“Give me your blood, and I’ll help you eliminate these people. Then I’ll go to the major sanctuaries and kill your enemies!” The elder’s eyes glowed with intensity, gazing at Luo Tian like a prey.

The old man had lived so long that he had reached his limit, surviving only by collecting the life essence of countless people during each chaos. This special body was what he loved.

“Old dog!” Luo Tian’s face darkened, gazing at the old man and cursing inwardly. But it wasn’t yet time to unleash the great array.

People gasped at the old man’s words, their faces filled with disbelief as they gazed at Luo Tian. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so extraordinary, surviving despite being suppressed by Heaven.

“Buzz…” Waves of energy echoed again as several figures appeared before the crowd, their bodies radiating intense blood energy and youthful vitality.

“Early-stage saint?” People saw the figures, their faces obscured by secret methods.

“Major sanctuaries’ disciples!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered, gazing at the young figures and smiling grimly.

“Most have arrived!” Luo Tian glanced around the crowd, especially deeply at the old man from the Nether Region. He silently prayed that Wan Lingkong was reliable.

People who had previously been killed by Luo Tian showed shock, gazing at those surrounding Luo Tian. The lineup was unparalleled.

Four late-stage saints, one peak-stage saint—Nether Region Nine Saints’ ninth, an ancient monster who had lived countless years. Seven middle-stage saints with powerful energy fluctuations, and some young early-stage saints who weren’t much weaker than the middle stage. Though their faces were obscured, they were clearly major sanctuaries’ disciples.

Each of these people would be renowned; now, they had all gathered in the demon domain for Luo Tian.

“Boy, what other tricks do you have? Use them!” The Scorpion’s leader, supported by the Nether Region Nine Saints, glared coldly. He wanted to devour Luo Tian alive; his brothers had been killed by him.

“Since everyone has arrived, those who didn’t come—may their luck be good! I’ll kill them next time!” Luo Tian’s bloodstained robes fluttered in the wind, his gaze falling on everyone.

Seeing people eager to fight, Luo Tian quickly spoke, holding a golden array flag. The golden light was weak.

“An array? Even against us, you still have one? How laughable!” The Scorpion laughed disdainfully. With a peak-stage saint present, they didn’t believe any array could withstand one strike from the peak-stage saint.

Luo Tian, however, didn’t care; his face showed seriousness as he slammed the golden array flag into the void beneath him. His hands moved swiftly, and as his hands changed, the stars around him glowed with gold. Array flags flew from the void, clearly prepared by Luo Tian beforehand.

“Celestial Punishment Array! Open!” Luo Tian coldly spoke, his voice like nine abyssal ices, making people instinctively shiver.

Chapter 1012: Ambush and Destruction
