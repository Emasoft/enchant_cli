"Damn it, why is it always me who gets hurt!" Xu Liyi's face was grim; the bloodstains on his back had drawn two more bloodthirsty mosquitoes toward him.

"Run for your life! Once we reach solid ground, we can unleash our Divine Power and no longer fear these Hunmeng Bloodthirsty Mosquitoes!" Luotian encouraged Xu Liyi, though his heart was heavy with worry.

"Boom... Boom..." Xu Liyi crushed two more mosquitoes, his face pale and body radiating a faint aura of weakness.

"Damn it! I, Xu Liyi, who once dominated the Nine Realms, now face death by mosquitoes? This is truly humiliating!" Xu Liyi cursed bitterly, his speed slowing.

Luotian's gaze sharpened as he noticed Xu Liyi's faltering pace, realizing the latter had lost much of his vitality and life force to three mosquitoes.

Thinking this, Luotian slowed his pace, leaped forward, and seized Xu Liyi.

"Luotian!" Xu Liyi's eyes flickered with understanding, gratitude flashing in his gaze.

"Stop pretending to be strong! You really want to feed the mosquitoes?" Before Xu Liyi could speak, Luotian snapped at him.

Carrying Xu Liyi, Luotian maintained his speed, closely following Diao Yuanshan toward the opposite shore.

As time passed, Luotian and Xu Liyi fell slightly behind Diao Yuanshan.

"Buzz..." The sound of mosquitoes echoed as Luotian was finally overtaken by two bloodthirsty mosquitoes—one landed on Xu Liyi's back, the other on Luotian's arm.

The mosquitoes moved strangely; their proboscises pierced both men immediately upon landing.

"Boom... Boom..." Xu Liyi reacted swiftly, slapping the mosquitoes to death, their blood splattering onto both men.

"Luotian! This won't work! Leave me behind and go!" Xu Liyi, seeing the gray vortex hundreds of zhang away, his face darkened as he shouted.

A thunderous sound echoed as Xu Liyi continued striking the mosquitoes relentlessly.

"Don't talk nonsense! As long as I'm here, you won't die!" Luotian's eyes burned crimson, his face pale as he stared at the vortex ahead, determination blazing in his gaze.

"Two masters, I'm here!" Just as Xu Liyi felt despair, a giant ant the size of a fingernail appeared beneath Luotian's feet, transforming into a black humanoid—Yan Jun of the Star Dragon Ant Clan.

In terms of power, Yan Jun surpassed Luotian significantly. He lifted both men effortlessly, sprinting to catch up with Diao Yuanshan.

"Ah..." Diao Yuanshan exhaled deeply, watching Yan Jun carrying the two men as he closed in. A flicker of admiration crossed his face.

With Yan Jun's aid, the four's speed increased again, finally reaching solid ground before the vortex caught up. They panted heavily.

"Buzz..." The gray vortex arrived instantly, surrounding the four men with its bloodthirsty aura.

"Damn it! I couldn't use Divine Power earlier, but now I'll kill you all!" Xu Liyi stood, golden light flashing as he faced the sky-darkening swarm of bloodthirsty mosquitoes. His hands moved swiftly, Divine Power surging like an ocean toward the vortex.

Diao Yuanshan's eyes burned with fury; it had been years since he felt such humiliation. His hands moved, violet energy erupting from his palms.

"Master, please don't fight!" Before Diao Yuanshan could act, Luotian blocked him, fearing the toxin in Diao Yuanshan's body.

"Rest easy; it's fine. We're nearly there, and the problem should be minimal!" Diao Yuanshan smiled but obeyed Luotian's command.

Blocking Diao Yuanshan, Luotian's eyes flashed with violet light, his gaze fixed on the endless swarm. A smirk tugged at his lips.

"It seems I can further evolve the碧晶琉璃火 (Emerald Crystal Jade Flame)!" Luotian's eyes gleamed, his hand striking the ground. A green flame erupted, engulfing the sky in searing heat that scorched the mosquitoes.

"Buzz..." As before, the endless Hunmeng Bloodthirsty Mosquitoes were instantly repelled by the Emerald Crystal Jade Flame. In moments, they were all incinerated, and the flame itself evolved, its form resembling a wiggling infant.

"This heavenly fire has such astonishing effects here! And it even evolves—this must be because the local creatures have absorbed immortal essence. Such a substance is undoubtedly a great nourishment for heavenly fire!" Xu Liyi marveled, watching the flame dance like an intelligent child.

"Immortal essence? It's not just beneficial for heavenly fire—it would be invaluable to anyone. If there were enough, it could rival a single immortal herb!" Diao Yuanshan's face showed admiration.

"Damn it, Luotian! Make that thing spit out the immortal herb!" Xu Liyi's face lit up, shouting at Luotian.

"Spit your mother! It's already been absorbed and refined by the Emerald Crystal Jade Flame—how can it spit it out?" Luotian sighed, exasperated by Xu Liyi's greed.

"Alright, masters, we've arrived at the location of the Star Dragon Ant Clan's Feather Transformation Immortal Pool!" Yan Jun's face was alight with excitement as he addressed Luotian and the others, their eyes reflecting similar joy.

"I wonder if the Immortal Pool still exists... According to clan records, it never dries out. So there shouldn't be much trouble."

"Our only concern is the danger here. We've reached the heart of the Dragon-Devouring Valley—this place must be even more perilous than before," Yan Jun's gaze darkened as he added.

"Let's go!" Xu Liyi patted Yan Jun's shoulder and strode toward the ruins.

"Interesting, truly the clan of an Epoch Master—why doesn't your Star Dragon Ant Clan possess any Epoch Treasures?" Xu Liyi walked through the ruins, questioning Yan Jun.

"Indeed, Epoch Masters usually leave an Epoch Treasure for their descendants. Why does your Star Dragon Ant Clan have nothing?" Luotian's eyes held confusion.

"I don't know either. From birth, our clan has been like this. I've never seen an Epoch Treasure... but I recall elders mentioning that our ancestors' pseudo-Epoch Treasure might be here, suppressing something."

"Suppressing what? What needs an Epoch Treasure to suppress?" Hearing this, Luotian and Xu Liyi's eyes widened in fear, Diao Yuanshan's face darkened.

"Once we find the Feather Transformation Immortal Pool and unlock my poison and your heavenly decree suppression, we'll leave immediately!" Diao Yuanshan's gaze was grave as he addressed the three.

Chapter 1104: Blood-Soaked ( )

Hearing Diao Yuanshan's words, Luotian and the others felt his intense dread. Though puzzled, they said nothing—Diao Yuanshan's fear suggested a grave matter.

"Legends say that in their later years, Epoch Masters would enter a forbidden zone. Some didn't even leave an Epoch Treasure for their descendants, seeking to suppress a seal within the forbidden zone. What that seal holds remains unknown to all but the Epoch Masters themselves."

"Currently, it seems the Dragon-Devouring Valley has suffered a change. I suspect these creatures are what the Epoch Masters sought to suppress. Perhaps the valley's seal has loosened, and something momentous may yet occur!" Diao Yuanshan explained to Luotian and the others, answering their curiosity.

Luotian, Xu Liyi, and Yan Jun listened in awe, their minds reeling.

"An object so fearsome that even Epoch Masters must suppress it! What could be more terrifying than an Epoch Master?" Luotian's eyes held deep confusion.

"Immortality has no bounds. I've heard that reaching the highest realm grants eternal life. Epoch Masters can live through two eras, relying on a single immortal herb to defy fate—yet they are not the ultimate realm. As for what lies beyond Epoch Masters, one must reach that stage to know," Diao Yuanshan spoke as he hurried through the ruins, answering their questions.

"Alas... An Epoch Master is the strongest in the Nine Realms. Perhaps no one has yet achieved true immortality, save for immortal herbs and Epoch Treasures," Xu Liyi sighed inwardly, his gaze filled with longing.

"It doesn't matter. Life is but a fleeting journey—live freely, unburdened by guilt. What's the point of immortality if all loved ones perish while you alone endure?" Luotian shook his head, having once harbored thoughts of immortality when he first joined the Feiyun Sect. But after truly embracing cultivation, those thoughts vanished.

As they conversed, the four traversed the ruins but found no trace of the Feather Transformation Immortal Pool.

"Where is it? Yan Jun, as a Star Dragon Ant Clan member, you must know where the Feather Transformation Immortal Pool is!" Xu Liyi patted Yan Jun's shoulder, questioning him.

"I... I don't know..." Yan Jun's gaze flickered nervously as he replied.

"Hope!"

"You're hiding something, aren't you? Spill it!" Xu Liyi lunged toward Yan Jun, his eyes flashing threats.

"I truly don't know!" Yan Jun shook his head quickly, gazing at Xu Liyi. Yet even Luotian and Diao Yuanshan noticed Yan Jun's furtiveness, especially Xu Liyi, who knew Yan Jun's weaknesses.

Xu Liyi knew Yan Jun was stubborn but also understood his weakness—his greed for pills. He waved a hand, five fragrant medicinal pills appearing in his palm.

"Kid, tell me the method!" Xu Liyi addressed Yan Jun.

As the pills appeared, Yan Jun's drool flowed, his eyes fixated on Xu Liyi with greed.

"Master, I can't say!" Yan Jun's face showed inner conflict, his desire warring with the consequences of revealing it.

"100 pills!" Xu Liyi gritted his teeth—though 100 pills weren't much, to him, it was a painful sacrifice.

"100!" Yan Jun's black eyes widened, his breath quickened as he stared at Luotian with intense longing.

"How about it?" Xu Liyi's eyes gleamed with confidence, believing he had Yan Jun cornered.

"Master, if it were anything else, I'd agree. But this... I can't!" Yan Jun clenched his teeth, shaking his head.

"Damn it, are you out of your mind!" Xu Liyi's eyes widened in disbelief, as if he'd never seen Yan Jun before. He patted Yan Jun's head.

When Xu Liyi first entered the Dragon-Devouring Valley, he'd nearly fought Yan Jun over three pills. Now, 100 seemed to have no effect on him.

"You're swelling up!" Xu Liyi narrowed his eyes, a dangerous glint in them as he stared at Yan Jun.

"Enough! Don't pressure Yan Jun," Luotian interjected. "Yan Jun, rest assured—no matter what, I'll gift your Star Dragon Ant Clan ten thousand low-tier and five thousand mid-tier sacred pills once we escape!"

"Wha—!" Luotian's words had barely finished when Yan Jun's eyes turned blood-red, his gaze on Luotian burning with fervor.

"Haha! Kid, I forgot to tell you—Luotian is one of the top alchemists among humans. The pills I gave you were all his work. As long as there's enough medicinal herbs, you can have as many as you want!" Xu Liyi looked at Yan Jun, his eyes filled with pride.

"Good! Since you're so generous, I'll take the risk!" Yan Jun's eyes flashed with determination as he addressed Luotian.

"No need. Let's search again. I gave you the pills not for any reason—since you called me master, I'll do my best to help you and your clan!" Luotian shook his head, gazing at Yan Jun with sincerity.

"Master, before I came, the Queen Ant told me that through my Star Dragon Ant Clan's bloodline guidance, I could find where the Feather Transformation Immortal Pool lies!" Yan Jun spoke resolutely.

"Blood? It's just a little, right?" Xu Liyi was puzzled by Yan Jun's reluctance. He'd always obeyed him before.

Diao Yuanshan and Luotian also looked confused, their gazes questioning Yan Jun—after all, a little blood wasn't a big deal.

"It's not a big deal... but to me..." Yan Jun's face turned red, his eyes filled with embarrassment as he looked at Luotian.

"Damn it... really?" Xu Liyi's eyes widened, disbelief etched on his face. Even Luotian and Diao Yuanshan stared at Yan Jun in shock—Yan Jun's weakness was fatal, and it was absurd.

"In the cultivation world, bloodshed is common—too many battles and fights. Yan Jun's weakness is truly deadly; it's just absurd."

"Since you're so generous, I won't disappoint you. Sacrificing a little blood is nothing! But after I faint, it's all up to you!" Yan Jun's face was flushed with shame as he addressed Luotian.

"Don't worry, brother—leave it to me!" Xu Liyi patted Yan Jun's shoulder. Knowing he'd revealed his greatest weakness, Yan Jun had truly become one of their closest allies.

"Also, don't tell anyone, it's too embarrassing!" Yan Jun's eyes held shame, his gaze pleading.

"Don't worry, I'm not a gossipmonger!" Xu Liyi patted Yan Jun's shoulder, vowing to keep it secret.

Luotian's lips twitched as he watched Xu Liyi, feeling the man was unreliable. Among their group, the third of Star River Four Thieves, Ren Hongzhe, was first for being talkative; Xu Liyi ranked second.

"Ah, I believe you, master!" Yan Jun's eyes glowed with gratitude before he said no more, extending his finger.

"Go ahead!" Yan Jun gritted his teeth, closing his eyes to signal Luotian and the others.

Luotian and Diao Yuanshan exchanged glances, finally directing their gaze at Xu Liyi.

"Damn it..." Xu Liyi muttered under his breath, his fingers slicing through Yan Jun's arm.

Yan Jun didn't resist, and a blood jet shot out immediately. Yan Jun winced slightly but glanced at it.

"Boom..." A moment later, Yan Jun's eyes rolled back, and he collapsed to the ground. His body emitted waves of energy, transforming into a tiny Star Dragon Ant.

"Really fast!" Luotian and the others were speechless; Yan Jun was truly a first in history for fainting from blood.

"Shoo..." But soon, their attention turned to Yan Jun's blood, which carried a greenish hue and emitted a buzzing sound. It seemed to have found its home, flying toward the sky under their gaze.

"Follow it!" Luotian leapt into the air, grabbing Yan Jun who had fallen into unconsciousness. He followed the blood jet, while Diao Yuanshan and Xu Liyi also moved to follow Luotian.

The blood jet flew swiftly, emitting a buzzing sound in the sky, circling like a child returning home.

After a moment, it circled over a ruin and slammed into the ground with a "plop."

"Splosh..." The blood splattered, seeping into the ground. But it only penetrated an inch before losing its vitality, appearing like ordinary blood.

"Here?" Luotian and the others' eyes flickered but felt no particular significance in the ground. Still, they activated golden light to protect their bodies and dove underground.

Chapter 1105: Feather Transformation Immortal Scripture

In a ruin of the Dragon-Devouring Valley, Luotian, Diao Yuanshan, and Xu Liyi plunged underground, traversing the earth.

"One thousand zhang... two thousand zhang..." In a blink, they'd descended three thousand zhang. Yet the surrounding earth still emitted an eerie aura, causing their brows to furrow slightly.

Luotian glanced at the Yan Jun who had transformed into his true form, his eyes filled with reluctance. He gritted his teeth and continued descending—only three thousand zhang so far.

"Ten thousand zhang... twenty thousand zhang..." As time passed, they descended another twenty thousand zhang. This time, their eyes lit up with joy; the surrounding earth no longer carried a decayed scent, and deathly energy was gradually repelled.

Luotian knew this was a good sign. He continued descending, reaching an astonishing depth of fifty thousand zhang before discovering a subterranean palace. Though lifeless, it bore traces of past inhabitants.

"Found it! I can sense a powerful aura—this must be the Feather Transformation Immortal Pool the Queen Ant spoke of!" Xu Liyi exclaimed, his voice filled with excitement.

"Don't get too excited yet—find it first before celebrating!" Diao Yuanshan spoke softly, but his furrowed brows eased slightly. The three cautiously approached the aura.

The surroundings still held some bones, but they lacked any divine essence—touching them turned to ash.

After another half-hour, they reached what appeared to be a pool. Their eyes reflected wistfulness.

Before them lay a hundred-zhang-long and wide pool, seemingly dried by time. Yet streams of clear spring water flowed from its source, obscuring their view of the pool's depth. Yet Luotian felt a profound chill from the spring water.

"What is this?" Diao Yuanshan's eyes held confusion as he gazed at the pool, then contemplation.

But Luotian's eyes widened in shock—this spring was familiar. He'd encountered it before, and it had changed his life.

"Yanhu潭 (Yanhu Spring)!" Luotian whispered, his eyes filled with disbelief. He never expected to find Yanhu Spring here.

He'd first seen it in the Great An Forest, and falling into it had granted him the Epoch Scripture and restored his former physique. He never thought he'd find it again after so many years.

At that time, his strength was low; now, he was vastly stronger. Yet gazing at Yanhu Spring still filled him with trepidation.

"The power of an Epoch Master is truly boundless—how could they have restrained Yanhu Spring to serve their clan's cultivation?"

"Words on both sides of the pool!" Xu Liyi, with sharp eyes, suddenly noticed golden characters inscribed on the pool's edges.

"Feather Transformation Immortal Scripture!" Yan Jun, who had just awakened, saw the small characters on the pool's edge and leaped from Luotian's arms.

"Feather Transformation Immortal Scripture! It's really the Feather Transformation Immortal Scripture, hahaha!" Yan Jun laughed like a child.

"Feather Transformation Immortal Scripture—what is it? But the name alone suggests it's mighty!" Xu Liyi, seeing Yan Jun's reaction, his eyes gleamed.

"The Feather Transformation Immortal Scripture is a supreme scripture created by our clan's Epoch Master, complementing the Feather Transformation Immortal Pool. It unlocks ultimate power—this journey into the Dragon-Devouring Valley's heart was worth it!" Yan Jun danced with joy, his black eyes filled with delight.

Hearing this, even Diao Yuanshan was stunned; if the Feather Transformation Immortal Scripture spread to the Nine Realms, it would ignite a fierce competition among sects and clans.

"Indeed, this risk was worth it!" Diao Yuanshan's eyes glowed with a smile as he scanned the golden characters.

However, Luotian and the others soon realized the Epoch Master's methods were truly extraordinary—these characters seemed to possess a mystical power, making them impossible to memorize.

"The Feather Transformation Immortal Scripture must be used with the Feather Transformation Immortal Pool—only by entering the pool can one grasp its true scripture!" Yan Jun's face was alight with excitement, yearning to leap into the pool.

"Let's go! Let's see what effects this Feather Transformation Immortal Pool has—unleashing my poison and your heavenly decree suppression!" Diao Yuanshan spoke softly, then leaped into the pool.

"Boom..." As Diao Yuanshan entered the spring, barely a few breaths passed before his body exploded, causing Luotian and the others to freeze in shock.

"Master Diao!"

"Old master!" Luotian and the others cried out, hovering above the pool with sorrowful eyes.

"How could Master Diao—half-step Epoch Master—fall like this!" Xu Liyi's voice trembled, his deep feelings for Diao Yuanshan evident.

Luotian's eyes reddened, tears welling as he stared in disbelief at Diao Yuanshan's death—only a few breaths had passed.

"Buzz..." As Luotian and the others mourned, waves of energy spread outward. The eerie spring water rippled, then Diao Yuanshan's shattered body reassembled before their astonished eyes.

"Boom..." Diao Yuanshan burst from the water, his eyes filled with fear as he spoke: "I'm fine. But it was terrifying!"

"Just now, I felt like I truly died. Yet I've come back to life!" Diao Yuanshan's voice trembled with lingering fear, his gaze heavy.

"Yet I gained much—my poison seems lighter, and my body has improved slightly. More surprisingly, during those few seconds of death, I heard a chorus of divine music—this must be the Feather Transformation Immortal Scripture's text!" Diao Yuanshan's eyes gleamed with anticipation, gazing at the seemingly dried but unfathomable Yanhu Spring.

"The Epoch Master's power is truly boundless—how could they have created such a place!" Luotian and the others marveled, in awe of the Epoch Master's abilities.

"Go in! The benefits are great for all of you!" Diao Yuanshan smiled, then leaped into the Feather Transformation Immortal Pool again.

"Plunk..." A moment later, Diao Yuanshan's body shattered and reassembled before their eyes.

"Damn it, this isn't something a human can endure! Did your ancestor's Epoch Master go mad!" Xu Liyi's lips twitched as he watched Diao Yuanshan reappear before them.

At this point, Diao Yuanshan had experienced two deaths but his body was stronger, radiating purple light and appearing younger.

"Let's go in!" Luotian's eyes glowed with a smile, his heart thrilled. If the heavenly decree suppression worked, rescuing Gu Tian would be imminent!

Thinking this, Luotian leaped into the Feather Transformation Immortal Pool. A bone-chilling cold instantly froze him.

"Familiar feeling!" Luotian smiled, sensing the ice that could freeze everything.

"Boom..." Next moment, his body exploded, and he floated in a state of soul separation, as if caught in reincarnation.

"Dao can be spoken, but it's not the eternal Dao; names can be named, but they're not eternal names..." As Luotian's body shattered and he seemed to fall into reincarnation, golden characters flowed through the channels of his mind.

"Feather Transformation Immortal Scripture!" Luotian's heart surged with joy, determined to memorize the scripture despite his body.

A string of divine music-like voices echoed in Luotian's perception, and he reached the peak of joy. He continuously absorbed the scripture, his soul seemingly ascending to a higher realm. This Feather Transformation Immortal Scripture was created by an Epoch Master—its benefits were boundless if fully grasped.

Luotian didn't know how long had passed outside, but he felt as if he existed in another form, forgetting time's passage and drifting through the river of time.

"Human!" A low growl echoed as something awakened, sensing Luotian's presence and appearing before him in an altered state.

At this moment, Luotian's form was golden, while the other soul before him was black. They seemed like ancient enemies in a different form, facing each other.

Hearing the voice, Luotian instantly regained consciousness. At the same time, his physical body reassembled outside, pulling his soul back.

Luotian slowly opened his eyes, a glimmer of gold in them. His body radiated explosive power; though he felt he'd drifted for a long time, outside it had only been several breaths.

"Qi energy!" Luotian's face lit up with joy, sensing some qi presence.

Chapter 1106: Future Enemies

In the heart of the Dragon-Devouring Valley, four figures continuously reassembled from the Star Dragon Ant Clan's Feather Transformation Immortal Pool. Each time they jumped into the icy water, Xu Liyi grimaced, clearly uncomfortable with the pain of death.

Though painful, the results were evident—Diao Yuanshan and Luotian felt stronger than before. Their bodies had ascended a level, easily overpowering peers.

Most exciting for Luotian was his ability to sense qi energy—each time he entered the pool and reassembled, the amount of qi he could sense increased.

If visible, one would notice that the "sin" character on Luotian's back was gradually disappearing.

"One power over all methods!" Yan Jun's black hair flew as his body emitted explosive strength, shouting into the sky.

"Success! I've finally grasped the Feather Transformation Immortal Scripture and understood the essence of power—unlimited strength, one power over all methods!" Yan Jun shouted joyfully. This was the dream of the Star Dragon Ant Clan for centuries; today, Yan Jun had achieved it. He now had a chance to retrace the path of his clan's Epoch Master.

Since Luotian first encountered that black shadow, he hadn't seen it again.

"Who was that black figure?" Luotian's mind filled with questions—where had it come from, and why did it feel so terrifying?

Time passed slowly. A week later, Xu Liyi could no longer endure and refused to jump into the Feather Transformation Immortal Pool.

"I've grasped half of the Feather Transformation Immortal Scripture—this is my limit. If I jump again, I'll go mad!" Xu Liyi sighed inwardly, watching Luotian and the others continue to jump into the pool like fools.

"Ah..." Yan Jun shouted, his voice filled with madness and determination. Three days after Xu Liyi stopped jumping into the pool, Yan Jun emerged from it, his body glowing with gold.

"Kid, you're amazing! I feel like you're only slightly behind me now!" Xu Liyi, who had been brooding for three days, smiled at Yan Jun's appearance. He could tell Yan Jun was also exhausted.

"Master, have you grasped the Feather Transformation Immortal Scripture?" Yan Jun's eyes glowed with admiration as he looked at Xu Liyi.

"Of course! Don't you know who I am? I'm the greatest genius in history!" Xu Liyi laughed, his voice filled with pride.

"Unbelievable! I've used so many talents to grasp this ancient scripture, but you mastered it three days earlier!" Yan Jun's admiration deepened as he looked at Xu Liyi, his voice filled with shame.

"Ugh... grass!" Xu Liyi's expression froze upon hearing Yan Jun's words, realizing Yan Jun had mastered the complete Feather Transformation Immortal Scripture while he'd only grasped half.

"Master, what's wrong?" Yan Jun, glowing with gold energy, looked at Xu Liyi's expression and asked in confusion.

"Ahem! Yan Jun, there are always higher realms beyond our understanding—stay humble!" Xu Liyi's eyes glowed with a hint of satisfaction, not wanting to reveal he'd only grasped half the scripture.

"Indeed! Indeed!" Yan Jun's eyes glowed with admiration, nodding heavily. He could feel how powerful he was now—unlimited strength, as if he could tear apart the heavens.

"I wish all Star Dragon Ant Clan members could enter here! Then our clan might once again flourish!" Yan Jun's eyes glowed with longing.

Unfortunately, this was just a dream—this place no longer belonged to the Star Dragon Ant Clan but had become a forbidden zone.

"Buzz..." As Xu Liyi and Yan Jun waited, two days later Diao Yuanshan laughed heartily, appearing in their sight. Purple energy surrounded him, filling the underground palace with a powerful aura that made Xu Liyi and Yan Jun tremble.

"Ha! This is truly a great place!" Diao Yuanshan's eyes gleamed with excitement.

"Master Diao, your poison is gone!" Xu Liyi and Yan Jun approached, sensing Diao Yuanshan's restored cultivation and his renewed vitality.

"Yes! Not only did I recover, but I've also refined the Queen Bee's entire cultivation. My current strength is just one step away from entering the Epoch Initial Stage!" Diao Yuanshan's face was filled with excitement as he spoke.

"Epoch Initial Stage—congratulations, Master Diao!" Xu Liyi's eyes glowed with excitement. If Diao Yuanshan entered the Epoch Initial Stage, their support would be formidable.

"Now is not the time to face the Epoch Trial. Additionally, we need the divine punishment array Luotian set up to summon the Epoch Trial before truly entering the Epoch Initial Stage," Diao Yuanshan's eyes glowed with confidence, certain he could enter the Epoch Initial Stage.

"Luotian's kid is truly determined. I wonder if this Feather Transformation Immortal Pool can fully lift the heavenly decree suppression on Luotian?" Xu Liyi's eyes glowed with anticipation, eager for Luotian to break the heavenly decree and conquer all enemies.

"Boom... Boom..." As Xu Liyi and Diao Yuanshan waited, Luotian's powerful body continuously reassembled.

"One day... two days..." A month had passed since Luotian and the others entered the Dragon-Devouring Valley.
