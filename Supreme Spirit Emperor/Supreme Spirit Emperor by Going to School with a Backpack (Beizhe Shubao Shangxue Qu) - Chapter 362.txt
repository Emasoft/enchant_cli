Luo Tian traversed the first step with ease, but this was only for him. If an ordinary person had attempted it, they would have suffered severe injuries on the first step; the second would have been crushed by flames, and the third would have frozen to death.

“Nascent Soul Mountain!” Luo Tian’s spirit returned, his face etched with awe as he gazed at the grey mountain. He finally understood why this mountain could absorb Nascent Soul Immortal Light.

Nascent Soul Mountain, an unparalleled resource with infinite suction power. It was said that someone had forged it into a powerful artifact, and their enemies would be sucked into their hands with a single gesture.

“If this Nascent Soul Mountain were forged into an artifact, it would surely become a decisive weapon!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with excitement. His gaze narrowed as he began to scheme about the Nascent Soul Mountain.

“Ah, that’s why it separated into thunder, fire, and ice—most likely because it absorbed too much chaotic energy, breaking down into various attributes,” Luo Tian murmured before stepping onto the fourth level.

“Hum…” Indeed, as Luo Tian landed on the fourth step, an impossibly sharp aura immediately surged into his perception. A golden sword pierced through space and flew toward him.

“Return!” Luo Tian extended his hand, using his supreme physical body to resist the sharp aura. He seized the golden sword in his grasp.

“Boom…” The golden divine sword shattered violently in Luo Tian’s hands, vanishing from his sight.

“Go!” Understanding the nature of this place, Luo Tian laughed and soared toward the summit of Nascent Soul Mountain.

As Luo Tian ascended, the ultimate forces of various attributes continuously manifested on each level.

“Eighth level!” Luo Tian’s face lit with a smile as he punched through the storm on the eighth step. His eyes reflected admiration at the ninth level, now only a thousand zhang away, with an altar to collect Nascent Soul Immortal Light at the summit.

“Ascend!” Luo Tian took a step and instantly stood on the ninth level’s peak, his face solemn. His gaze swept toward the altar that could absorb Nascent Soul Immortal Light.

“What is this?” A powerful aura surged into Luo Tian’s mind, and he felt an apocalyptic force within the era, leaving him in awe.

“Hum…” However, Luo Tian’s expression darkened immediately. He had been so focused on the massive altar that he’d forgotten the peril of this final level.

At that moment, Luo Tian clearly felt his body grow impossibly heavy, and all his cultivation was swiftly sealed, rendering him powerless.

“Hum…” Worse still, he sensed his cultivation power diminishing continuously. His five reincarnation bodies grew increasingly ethereal.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian muttered, activating his Reincarnation Heaven Art to resist the terrifying suction.

But as he just began to counter, a grey vortex above him rotated again, and an unparalleled light appeared in Luo Tian’s vision.

“This Nascent Soul Immortal Light only manifests three times. If you fail to collect it on the third occasion, you’ll have to wait half a year!” Jiang Sxi shouted at Luo Tian, her eyes filled with anxiety as she sensed his current state was off.

“Ah…” Luo Tian roared to the sky. He had come this far; how could he accept failure?

The white light illuminated the entire sky, causing Luo Tian’s face to sweat coldly.

An ultimate refining force acted upon him, and a white light emerged from the chaotic vortex, distorting Luo Tian’s vision.

Awe—Luo Tian’s first feeling was awe. This light seemed to belong to no world, so beautiful yet terrifyingly powerful. The most astonishing part was its might; under this light, Luo Tian felt insignificant.

“Ah…” Luo Tian’s blood surged as he pushed off the ground, rushing toward the light. No matter what, he had to grasp it.

“Sizzle…” Mist rose from Luo Tian’s body as his figure surged toward the dazzling light, his aura blazing with madness.

“Thousand zhang… hundred zhang…” Due to the loss of his cultivation, Luo Tian relied solely on his body to grasp it, using no power at all.

“Come here!” Luo Tian roared, blocking the trajectory of Nascent Soul Immortal Light and reaching for the dazzling light.

“Plop…” The radiant light pierced Luo Tian’s abdomen, continuing toward the massive altar.

“Return!” Luo Tian ignored his body’s severe damage, his eyes blood-red as he stared at the light piercing through him. He seized it with both hands.

Luo Tian’s hand grasped the light, which felt like a tangible entity. However, this light pulled his body toward the altar.

“Luo Tian!” Leng Qiuchan and Jiang Sxi’s faces darkened instantly. Through the light, they clearly saw Luo Tian’s abdomen wound.

Though they didn’t know what the altar was, they knew it was definitely no good place. After years of absorbing Nascent Soul Immortal Light, the altar had become strangely sinister.

“Stop!” Luo Tian panted heavily, his arms veined with strain. He finally halted before falling into the altar, collapsing onto the steps in a clumsy manner.

“Success!” Luo Tian spat blood, his hands moving rapidly to seal the light and store it away.

Luo Tian’s eyes were filled with excitement. His greatest goal had been achieved, and he let out a long sigh.

Chapter 1452: Doubt

“Go!” Luo Tian’s condition was at its worst. To save his life, he didn’t want to stay any longer on Nascent Soul Mountain and leaped down to the eighth level.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian just rose, his pale face leaping down to the eighth level, the grey vortex immediately emitted waves of light. The third Nascent Soul Immortal Light thundered down.

“Dared to touch my things, yet you wish to live?” A low voice echoed across the grey mountain, cold and merciless. Luo Tian’s face changed instantly.

“Who is it!” Luo Tian’s mind trembled, his gaze filled with disbelief as he tensed up.

“Such a strong body! Unfortunately, I’ve cultivated an even stronger one. Otherwise, I would have taken over your body!” A grey figure emerged from the era, his gaze filled with greed as he watched Luo Tian leaping toward the eighth level.

“Leave, and leave your Nascent Soul Immortal Light behind. Don’t disrupt my plans!” The grey figure smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

“Soul?” As Luo Tian ran, he heard the old man’s words and his face changed. His lips curled slightly; instead of fleeing, he turned back with a playful gaze.

“Hum…” A dazzling light fell into the altar. The old man’s face turned sinister as he looked at Luo Tian: “Hand it over!”

“Powerful!” Luo Tian felt a strong aura from this soul, indicating the person was definitely a great sage.

“Did you say you wanted to possess me?” Luo Tian smiled, utterly dismissing the old man.

Soul—perhaps a formidable threat in others’ eyes—but to Luo Tian, it was nothing.

“Possessing you? What does that matter!” The old man sneered, a great sage even in death. Though he had become a soul, he still possessed immense cultivation, having obtained Nascent Soul Mountain through special means and maintained his life in another form.

To continue living, Nascent Soul Immortal Light was essential. Though Luo Tian had only taken one light, he knew that Nascent Soul Immortal Light appeared only three times every half-year.

“Soul-Subduing!” Luo Tian had no patience for further words, pointing his finger. A霸道 aura immediately acted upon the old man’s soul, causing his body to tremble.

“You are…” The old man’s voice carried shock. It was an instinctual fear from his soul, beyond his ability to resist.

“Soul-Subduing Master? Have you heard of it?” Luo Tian’s face held amusement as he spoke, extending his hand to grasp the old man’s soul with immense suction.

“Soul-Subduing!” The old man stammered, recalling the great Master Jie Tian of the Soul-Subduing. His face turned pale instantly.

“I’ve truly had bad luck! Meeting a Soul-Subduing Master—this is even rarer than being hit by a meteor!” The old man cursed inwardly, allowing the powerful suction to take him.

It wasn’t that he didn’t resist; it was simply unnecessary. The old man knew that encountering a Soul-Subduing Master meant his misfortune, and his life or death was entirely in the other’s hands.

“What is your name?” Luo Tian’s eyes held a smile as he gazed at the old man, now restrained and fearful.

“Old Man Gu Yongkang!” The old man replied quickly, his gaze toward Luo Tian filled with reverence.

“Gu Yongkang?” Hearing the old man’s name, Luo Tian felt a slight chill. He had certainly heard of Gu Yongkang before.

“Young master, your talent is unparalleled; your cultivation is formidable. It’s the first time I’ve seen such a person in my life. With the inheritance of the Soul-Subduing Master from Jie Tian, I can already see another Jie Tian rising in the Chaos Abyss!” Gu Yongkang’s face was solemn as he spoke, his words filled with reverence.

“…” Luo Tian was speechless, watching the old man lavish praise upon him. He sighed deeply.

“Old Man Gu Yongkang!” Luo Tian interrupted the old man, not wanting him to continue praising. He was concerned about the situation in the Nine Realms and quickly sealed Gu Yongkang away, his face filled with joy as he stood on the altar.

“Hum…” As soon as he stepped onto the altar, Luo Tian felt a powerful aura surge into the sky.

He then activated his Purple Extreme Demon Eyes to gaze into the altar’s depths, his face instantly filled with horror.

In his vision stood a figure radiating overwhelming power, its body shimmering with flowing light. Luo Tian recognized it—this was a body formed by Nascent Soul Immortal Light.

“Hmph, I never thought Gu Yongkang had such an era and such ambition!” Luo Tian mused. There was no doubt that Gu Yongkang had aimed to forge a powerful body with Nascent Soul Immortal Light. If successful, Gu Yongkang’s revival could indeed be a formidable force.

“Still, it was fortunate for me!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with amusement as he sat cross-legged on the altar, his hands moving to imprint seals, erasing Gu Yongkang’s presence on Nascent Soul Mountain and claiming it entirely.

Time passed slowly, and seven days later, Luo Tian opened his eyes, his gaze filled with radiant light. He waved his hand, and a powerful suction arose from Nascent Soul Mountain, directly affecting Leng Qiuchan and Jiang Sxi waiting below.

“What’s happening?” Their faces changed instantly. Due to the chaotic mist, they didn’t know what had happened to Luo Tian. The last image they saw was him pierced through the abdomen by Nascent Soul Immortal Light.

Now, pulled by suction, they felt anxious. However, Luo Tian’s voice echoed in their minds, bringing a glimmer of joy to their eyes.

In an instant, they appeared before Luo Tian, their faces filled with confusion as they gazed at him smiling.

“Come on, let’s refine this Nascent Soul Immortal Light! I believe our strength will greatly improve. Then we’ll return to the Nine Realms!” Luo Tian addressed them, pointing toward the body radiating overwhelming power in the altar’s depths.

“Hiss…” Seeing the body, Leng Qiuchan and Jiang Sxi inhaled sharply, their eyes filled with surprise. They sat cross-legged together with Luo Tian, refining the light.

…

In the Nine Realms, as the Chaos Lord’s overwhelming intimidation subdued the ancient royal clans entering the Nine Realms, they no longer dared to be arrogant.

But as time passed, the ancient royal clans harbored deep suspicions—that since ancient times, a realm master could only live two eras with the Immortal Medicine. How had the Chaos Lord, the fifth realm master of humanity, survived until now?

Though they doubted, the ancient royal clans dared not be too reckless. However, some geniuses infiltrated the Nine Realms gradually, spreading into it.

Tuyang Feiyang, Fan Jingyu, Fu Xingyue, and other geniuses of the ancient royal clans also stepped out of Lei Domain, colliding with human realm’s geniuses.

Even more brazenly, they set up a massive arena outside Lei Domain, boasting that human geniuses were all useless and no one dared to step onto the arena. Whoever dared would be killed instantly!

This arrogance enraged the human geniuses of the Nine Realms, but elder warriors suppressed them to avoid disrupting the peace brought by the Chaos Lord.

“Haha! What human geniuses? All nonsense! Nine body types, yet even in front of the ancient royal clans, they’re like tofu—crushed with one step!” The ancient royal clan’s people constantly roared on the arena, their shouts echoing across the Nine Realms.

“Damn it!” Everyone in the Nine Realms was furious, but due to the ancient royal clans’ immense power, no one dared to challenge them on the arena.

“Humanity doesn’t have any holy domains? Have they become so weak that they can’t even raise a genius?”

“If our injuries have healed, and no human genius dares to come forward, then the ancient royal clans will surely invade the Nine Realms!” Finally, the ancient royal clan’s era peak elders spoke out, doubting that the Chaos Lord had already died. The previous attack was merely a tactic for future generations.

“Damn it! My clan’s Sun Miechen will go to Lei Domain and fight you!” Hearing the ancient royal clans’ elders, Sun Miechen could no longer remain seated and decided to go to Lei Domain.

“Good, if you win, perhaps we’ll consider not attacking your holy domains!” The ancient royal clan’s geniuses stood on the arena, laughing as they responded.

“Did you think we had no one?” Almost all of the holy domain geniuses spoke simultaneously, determined to go to Lei Domain and give these arrogant ancient royal clans a lesson.

Chapter 1453: Ten Thousand Clans Conference

In the Chaos Abyss, on the grey Nascent Soul Mountain, a man and two women sat together. A dazzling light surrounded them, their auras formidable.

A miniature wolf, its body blue and eyes green, lay before them, alertly watching over the three.

Ten days had passed since Luo Tian and his companions absorbed the body formed by Nascent Soul Immortal Light.

In ten days, their auras had changed drastically, with continuous thunderous sounds echoing from their bodies.

“My million-year accumulation!” A mournful cry echoed in Luo Tian’s storage ring.

At this moment, Gu Yongkang’s soul was bleeding internally, but since souls had no hearts, he could only lament.

“Why did I have such bad luck? Meeting a Soul-Subduing Master! Even an era peak elder, I wouldn’t fear. Why did I meet a Soul-Subduing Master!” Gu Yongkang was regretful, realizing he should have let Luo Tian leave after he took one Nascent Soul Immortal Light. He shouldn’t have boasted to keep Luo Tian and ended up having his base taken over.

“Hum…” Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, his body radiating waves of power. His face held a smile as he clenched his fists, his eyes filled with radiant light.

“Era peak!” Luo Tian murmured, feeling the thundering six reincarnation bodies within him. He was overjoyed.

“If I refine all this Nascent Soul Immortal Light, I should be able to form eight reincarnation bodies!” Luo Tian chuckled but didn’t continue refining. Cold Qiuchan and Jiang Sxi also needed to improve their strength, so he naturally wouldn’t compete with them. Entering the era peak made his confidence much stronger.

“Now, if I meet an era peak elder, I should be able to leave calmly!” Luo Tian murmured, clearly confident in his current self.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian spoke, the body formed by Nascent Soul Immortal Light in the altar finally disintegrated. Two white beams flew into Jiang Sxi and Leng Qiuchan’s bodies, and they slowly opened their eyes.

Their auras were overwhelming; the fortune of this refinement had allowed them to break into the era peak. Moreover, Luo Tian had only absorbed two percent, and the remaining eight were fully refined by them.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian smiled, taking each wife by the hand and descending from the grey Nascent Soul Mountain.

Upon reaching the ground, Luo Tian released them and waved his hands, sending a series of seals onto Nascent Soul Mountain.

“Boom…!” The massive mountain roared, and the nearly ten thousand zhang-high body collapsed into palm-sized size, landing in Luo Tian’s hand.

Luo Tian’s arm slightly trembled as he marveled at the Nascent Soul Mountain in his hand, addressing Gu Yongkang’s soul within his storage ring: “Thank you!”

“Ah… where, where? It is my honor to serve the Soul-Subduing Master!” Gu Yongkang’s aged soul cursed inwardly but wore a respectful expression as he spoke to Luo Tian.

“Let’s go! We should return. The ancient royal clans have emerged; I wonder what the situation is now!” Luo Tian gazed into the depths of the Chaos Abyss but didn’t proceed further.

Gaining Nascent Soul Immortal Light was Luo Tian’s greatest goal, and finding Leng Qiuchan and Jiang Sxi made him satisfied. If he continued deeper, he didn’t know what dangers awaited. Meeting Gu Yongkang was purely because he was a Soul-Subduing Master; if it were anyone else, the result would definitely not be this.

Luo Tian didn’t need to think about Gu Yongkang’s strength; the worst case was an era peak soul. Even encountering an era peak elder, he wouldn’t necessarily be Gu Yongkang’s match on Nascent Soul Mountain.

Luo Tian wasn’t greedy; this journey had already given him enough rewards, and he knew when to stop.

“Hmph!” Leng Qiuchan and Jiang Sxi naturally didn’t object; they had longed to return home, having been away from the Four Sacred Star Domains for over a decade.

After organizing themselves, they stored the wolf and cautiously walked toward the Chaos Abyss’s exit. They had come with someone guiding them, avoiding many dangers. Now, they were alone and had to be careful; they didn’t want to stay in the Chaos Abyss any longer.

After ten days of travel, Luo Tian and his companions finally emerged into the boundless starry sky, letting out long sighs of relief.

“Please, friends of the Chaos Domain, open the door to the small world so we can exit!” Luo Tian shouted into the void.

“Luo Tian!” Zhu Ge Chuhun’s face slightly changed, and he flew to the Chaos Holy Palace’s entrance. He waved his hand, opening the palace’s door.

A white light appeared in Luo Tian’s vision. Without hesitation, he rushed into the light with Leng Qiuchan and Jiang Sxi.

“Hum…” Waves of power passed through the three, instantly transporting them to the Chaos Holy Palace’s exterior.

“Out!” Luo Tian sighed in relief, then saw Zhu Ge Chuhun waiting for him.

“Luo Tian!” Upon seeing Luo Tian, Zhu Ge Chuhun immediately felt a strong sense of danger. His face changed instantly.

“Era peak!” Zhu Ge Chuhun felt Luo Tian’s cultivation and was filled with shock, which soon turned to bitterness.

Zhu Ge Chuhun had only one step left to reach the era peak but had yet to take it. Now, Luo Tian had entered the era peak, making him feel old.

“You young generation truly grew up; you’ve caught up with us old bones!” Zhu Ge Chuhun sighed softly, gazing at Luo Tian and the two women. He shook his head lightly.

“Master Zhu Ge, with the ten thousand clans entering the Nine Realms, how is the situation now?” Luo Tian gazed at Zhu Ge Chuhun and asked directly. Seeing that the Chaos Domain remained intact, Luo Tian’s heart gradually relaxed.

“Fairly well! There hasn’t been a large-scale invasion yet, but they’ve gradually infiltrated various star domains. Especially the ancient royal clans’ geniuses have set up arenas, trying to humiliate human geniuses!”

“Zhu Ge Qingtian, Zhu Ge Jie, and Zhu Ge Huangchao have already gone to Lei Domain to fight against those royal clans’ geniuses!”

“Other holy domains, the ones you know, also have people going to challenge the royal clans’ arrogance!” Zhu Ge Chuhun spoke softly, his voice filled with helplessness.

“Humanity is weak; without era peak elders, it’s always a major隐患. The Chaos Lord’s previous action only kept the royal clans calm for a while! I also plan to take the Chaos Bell to Lei Domain, fearing that the ten thousand clans might harm the geniuses!” Zhu Ge Chuhun sighed softly.

“I’ll go too!” Luo Tian nodded slightly, also worried about the few people from the Four Sacred Star Domains who couldn’t stay away.

“Hmph! Go then. It’s time for the ancient royal clans to see our Nine Realms’ strength. If we keep avoiding, they’ll become even more reckless!” Zhu Ge Chuhun nodded slightly. Luo Tian’s strength was unquestionable; besides the children of era masters, Luo Tian was definitely the strongest he had seen.

Luo Tian bid farewell to Zhu Ge Chuhun. Though their two domains had a long-standing feud, both knew that with the ancient royal clans’ arrival, they must set aside their grudges to survive this crisis in the Nine Realms.

Although it seemed that the ancient royal clans hadn’t yet attacked the Nine Realms, it was because they hadn’t yet assessed its overall strength. If they did, with the ancient royal clans’ hatred for humanity, they might launch a storm-like attack.

Luo Tian and the others directly took the transmission array, disappearing from the Chaos Domain and appearing under the Four Sacred Star Domains’ starry sky.

At this moment, the Four Sacred Star Domains were tense as well. Luo Tian and his companions flew through the vast starry sky, their eyes filled with excitement—after so many years away from home.

As soon as they returned to Tianyuan Continent, they were met by Luo Xiong and the elders of Five Elements Sect, their faces filled with joy as they gazed at Jiang Sxi and Leng Qiuchan.

“Zheng Xin, Gu Lei… where are they?” As soon as Luo Tian entered the Tianyuan Continent, he noticed those people weren’t there.

“They’ve gone to attend the Ten Thousand Clans’ Genius Conference!” Luo Xiong and others said with concern, informing Luo Tian of their whereabouts.

“Indeed!” Luo Tian nodded slightly, realizing that none of his peers were on the Tianyuan Continent. He guessed those people had gone to watch the spectacle.

“Still, don’t worry; Master Xuanbing and Old Man Diaolao have taken era treasures to secretly protect them. I think it should be fine!” Luo Xiong comforted Luo Tian.

“Hmph!” Luo Tian nodded slightly, his gaze deep and thoughtful, a smile on his lips.

“I wonder how those royal clans’ geniuses are doing now!” Luo Tian murmured, thinking of the geniuses he met in Origin Domain and sighed softly.

“I’ll go check!” Luo Tian smiled, his figure flickering as he left the Tianyuan Continent. Though Master Xuanbing was there, Luo Tian still worried about their safety. After all, those people were troublemakers; one misstep might lead to a major disaster. Especially with Sun Kienian, who could easily pierce the sky, and Gu Lei, Zheng Xin, Xu Liziyi—Luo Tian thought about them and felt a headache.

Chapter 1454: Bustling Scene

Outside the Lei Domain, a massive arena stood in the violent starry sky. Below it were countless figures with overwhelming auras, young and fierce.

However, the two sides of the arena were different; one side was entirely human, while the other had bizarre and strange forms.

“Truly bustling! How many years has it been since the Nine Realms had such a scene!” People murmured, gazing at those figures with overwhelming auras. Their eyes reflected admiration.

“Ten Realms’ Youth Gathering!” People discussed among themselves, but the two sides glared at each other with hatred.

“Haha! Come on, inferior humans—come fight me!” A tall figure leaped onto the arena, bare-chested with explosive power. His most noticeable feature was a fierce horn on his head, radiating golden light. He gazed at the young geniuses of the Nine Realms.

“Tianjiao Clan, a major clan among the ancient royal clans. Though not as strong as the royal clans, it has produced a great sage who reached near era peak!” People immediately recognized this young man’s origin.

“Maybe he’s around the same age as Luo Li and others!” Among the crowd, several figures with a somewhat sly appearance stood there. Their eyes held smiles as they whispered about the young man on the arena.

Though these figures seemed sly, their auras were no weaker—some at era mid-level, others at era peak. They were Sun Kienian, Gu Lei, Zheng Xin, and others.

“Wonder how those little bastards are doing? I wonder if Ming Huan has come yet. If he did, I’ll definitely skin him and pull out his sinews!” Zheng Xin waved his fists, eyes filled with killing intent.

“Who is it? Why hasn’t anyone from humanity come?” The young man on the arena looked at the human side with disdain.

“Humanity isn’t known for having nine body types? Come on, I’ll tear you apart!” The young man’s face held disdain, becoming even more arrogant.

“Hmph!” People immediately showed contempt. This young man was strong, but he wasn’t enough to be taken seriously. If he faced someone his age, he might have had the arrogance, but if it were Sun Miechen and others, one breath would crush him.

People knew that these young generations were just coming to watch the spectacle; the real battles would be between Sun Miechen’s generation.

“Who are you? Do you think humanity has no one?” Next, a streak of light cut through the stars and stood on the arena. His gaze was calm as he looked at the young man of Tianjiao Clan.

“Sun Junliang! The second son of Divine King Sun Miechen!” People immediately recognized the young man, their eyes filled with amazement. They gazed at Sun Junliang standing there calmly.

“Finally, a worthy opponent!” The young man of Tianjiao Clan saw someone from humanity and his face turned grim. He then pushed off the ground, golden horn radiating waves of power, rushing toward Sun Junliang.

“Hum…” A sound of battle echoed as a golden light flashed, like a meteor cutting through the stars. It appeared in people’s vision instantly.

Blood splattered, and people felt a flash before the young man who had boasted was split in two by the golden light.

“Too fast!” Everyone’s faces changed instantly, their eyes filled with amazement as they gazed at Sun Junliang standing there.

“Hmph, this kid is good. If it weren’t for Luo Li, Zimo, and Dong Yichen, this kid would be even more outstanding!” Diaolao spoke softly, his eyes filled with nostalgia as he thought of the kids who had been taken.

“Hmph, if my son were here, no one would be his match among the young generation!” Zheng Xin’s face held disdain as he watched Sun Junliang, now the center of attention.

The crowd murmured, and blood mist gradually merged. The young man of Tianjiao Clan appeared pale in people’s vision, his face filled with resentment.

“I’ll fight you!” The young man rushed toward Sun Junliang, shouting and his face filled with madness.

“Retreat!” Just as the young man moved, a cold voice echoed in his mind. Then, a youth with green aura appeared on the arena.

“Still not enough shame? The first battle already lost—go back!” The young man of Tianjiao Clan’s face was grim. When he turned and saw the youth in green robes, his face showed respect as he performed a strange gesture before leaping off the arena.

“Good show is about to begin!” Xu Lizi yi’s eyes held a smile as he gazed at the two young men on the arena.

“Ancient royal clan, Qilin Clan’s Qi Yuan!” The youth in green robes smiled proudly and bowed to Sun Junliang.

“Come on, I’ve long wanted to meet the ancient royal clans!” Compared to pride, the divine clan people in the Nine Realms were definitely proud.

“Kill!” Qi Yuan’s face held cold killing intent, transforming into a green light and rushing toward Sun Junliang.

“Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram!” Sun Junliang’s face held contempt as he waved his hands, and a massive diagram thundered from the stars. It carried heavy power and smashed toward Qi Yuan.

“Hmph, formidable! Six continents’ power!” Diaolao and others held amazement as they watched the massive diagram from the stars.

“Qilin Roar Heaven!” As Qi Yuan flew, his face slightly tensed and he stopped. He roared upward, then a series of green lightning erupted from his mouth, forming a green Qilin that roared toward the Divine King Nine Heavens Diagram.

“Boom…!” Thunderous sounds echoed on the massive arena, two martial arts colliding in the sky. The crowd watching was filled with amazement.

The two didn’t care about the martial arts colliding in the sky but rushed toward each other, engaging in close combat.

Figures crossed, and they collided repeatedly, evenly matched as if facing a formidable opponent. Each collision carried powerful waves, even making elder warriors moved.

“These two are indeed the representatives of their generation!” People stood there, discussing among themselves.

“Representatives? Did you forget the prodigies from the Four Sacred Star Domains? If they were here, the entire generation of ancient royal clans would be crushed!” Someone pointed out the prodigies from the Four Sacred Star Domains.

“Right! But it’s a pity those prodigies were all taken by Ming Huan!” People sighed in regret.

As people spoke, the two on the arena finally decided their fate. Qi Yuan transformed into his true form, a green foot crushing Sun Junliang’s body.

Though Sun Junliang was strong and his physique was good among peers, it wasn’t enough against the Qilin Clan’s physique comparable to dragons. He was immediately spitting blood and flying back, falling onto the arena.

“Die!” The massive body roared, green lightning rising from Qi Yuan’s horn, carrying powerful waves and smashing toward the wounded Sun Junliang.

“Is this going to kill him!” Next, people were stunned. Sun Junliang had already lost, but Qi Yuan didn’t stop; instead, he unleashed a stronger killing technique, causing people to be angry.

“Hmph!” Sun Miechen sneered and grabbed Sun Junliang with a golden hand, his face cold as he scanned the ancient royal clans.

“Haha! You dare to fight me while hiding behind your father? Come on, who else is there? I want to see what humanity has!” Qi Yuan wiped his mouth and sneered, standing on the arena.
