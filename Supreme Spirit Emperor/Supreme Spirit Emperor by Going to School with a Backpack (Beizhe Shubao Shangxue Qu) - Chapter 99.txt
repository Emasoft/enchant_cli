“Again, he has a habit of utterly destroying his opponent’s confidence!” Leng Qiuchan (Cold Autumn Cicada) said, his face bearing a look of sympathy as he gazed at Yang Hongguang (Yang Hongguang).

Upon hearing Leng Qiuchan’s words, Zheng Xin and Shan Yuyan (Single Speech Swallow) exchanged a glance. Both let out a quiet sigh, their hearts heavy with sorrow. Fortunately, they were friends of Luo Tian (Luo Tian), not his adversaries or enemies.

“Very well. Since the judges have announced the result, if neither of you has any objections, let us proceed to the third round—the final trial of today!” Zheng Hongsheng (Zheng Hongsheng) spoke aloud, his voice resolute.

The crowd watched Luo Tian with expressions of surprise. They had not expected such an outcome after the second round.

“Come on, Luo Dan Master!” The disciples of Jifeng Valley (Jifeng Valley) wore expressions of excitement, changing their address for Luo Tian.

“The third trial is alchemy. Rules are unrestricted—use your finest herbs to craft the most superior elixir, and we shall judge it!” An elder’s face lit up with anticipation as he announced the third trial's regulations.

Hearing this rule, Yang Hongguang’s eyes gleamed with excitement. He mused inwardly: “If I were to crush him utterly, he would have no face to claim a draw. After all, an alchemist must produce superior elixirs to be called such.”

Chapter 484: The One Qi Dragon Emperor Pill

When Luo Tian heard the rule about using his own herbs, a flicker of surprise crossed his gaze. A perceptive observer would have noticed this rule was slightly disadvantageous to him, for even as the Young Master of Yuling Sect (Yuling Sect), his resources in herbs and alchemy paled compared to Danzong’s (Danzong) deep-rooted heritage.

Moreover, outsiders had no idea that Luo Tian possessed the terrifying herbs from Dian’an Forest (Dian’an Forest) within his storage ring. They only perceived him as a young master of Yuling Sect.

Luo Tian knew precisely how many herbs he had in Yuling Sect. Since entering the sect, he had received no resources from it.

“Do you not wish me to win?” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed slightly. His gaze swept over the three sect masters and elders, but he found no clear clues.

“Whoever wishes me to lose—well, I shall prove it to you. The Bijin Lilu Fire (Bijin Lilu Fire) will change hands today!” Luo Tian’s lips curled into a cold smile.

Seeing the sneer on Luo Tian’s face, the three sect masters and elders exchanged glances, their expressions darkening. After a night of deliberation, they had aimed for a draw between the two contestants to avoid embarrassment. They had devised over ten rules to counter today’s developments.

Danzong (Danzong) was a major sect in the Eastern Region. To be humiliated by Jifeng Valley (Jifeng Valley) was a blow to their pride. In truth, they had initially sought ways to secure Luo Tian’s draw. However, one of them had raised the question: “What if Luo Tian wins?” To preempt this possibility, they had devised a plan.

“Hick! I wonder how you’ll win this round!” Yang Hongguang’s face lit up with excitement. The third trial was beneficial to him in more ways than one.

“Begin! The third trial has no time limit!” Elders spoke, aware that alchemy was not a task to be rushed. They had prepared for an extended contest.

“Suiyu Cauldron!” Yang Hongguang sneered, retrieving his alchemical cauldron. His eyes burned with fervor.

This Suiyu Cauldron (Suiyu Cauldron) was a relic of Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji). Though Yang Hongguang had gained fame, he had never possessed a suitable cauldron. Now that Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji) had agreed to let him claim Luo Tian’s Zhenhun Cauldron (Zhenhun Cauldron), he was overjoyed. This had driven Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji) into a frenzy.

“Yang Kaiji, you truly are willing to invest so heavily!” Leng Hongcai (Leng Hongcai) and others sneered, gazing at Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji).

“Does that boy not also have his own cauldron? There’s no question of fairness!” Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji) retorted coldly.

Seeing Yang Hongguang retrieve the Suiyu Cauldron (Suiyu Cauldron), Luo Tian marveled at Danzong’s (Danzong) deep-rooted heritage. He waved his hand, retrieving the Zhenhun Cauldron (Zhenhun Cauldron), a smile on his face. “Hehe, this is the first time I’ve used it so formally!”

Luo Tian gently caressed the cauldron’s surface, feeling a warm familiarity from it.

“Yang Hongguang has begun!” Danzong (Danzong) disciples watched as Yang Hongguang started alchemy, their faces alight with excitement.

Luo Tian observed Yang Hongguang’s figure, who had already begun placing herbs into the Suiyu Cauldron (Suiyu Cauldron). Yet he had not started alchemy, instead sitting cross-legged and closing his eyes in contemplation.

“What’s wrong with that kid? Has he gone mad?” Danzong (Danzong) disciples sneered.

Though Luo Tian had performed well in the first two rounds, it did not mean they favored him. Yang Hongguang’s alchemical prowess was deeply ingrained in their minds—five-star alchemist, an achievement beyond reach for his age.

“Yang Hongguang’s arrogance must have its basis. He must be at least a five-star alchemist. Five-star elixirs are no challenge for me now. Today, I shall attempt to break into six-star!” Luo Tian mused, opening his eyes as he decided what elixir to craft.

“One Qi Dragon Emperor Pill—this is it. A gift for Zheng Xin’s wedding! And Long Baobao (Long Baobao) would surely drool over it!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with resolve.

Luo Tian then began alchemy. The Thousand-Page Brush Technique (Thousand-Page Brush Technique) sprang into action, as he flung herbs radiating potent herbal energy into the Zhenhun Cauldron (Zhenhun Cauldron). His hands ignited a flame, which surged into the cauldron to begin refining the herbs.

“Three hundred herbs!” The five judges, closest to Luo Tian, bore expressions of astonishment. They had not expected him to produce three hundred herbs for an elixir.

Though Luo Tian had swiftly thrown them into the cauldron, the intense herbal energy still startled the five judges.

“Look! His flame—why has it turned purple!” The crowd observed Luo Tian, their faces filled with alarm.

“Thousand-Flame Inferno! Yuyan (Yuyan), you!” Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji) roared, his face contorted with anger as he gazed at Shan Yuyan (Single Speech Swallow) standing before Zheng Xin.

“Master Yang, you are willing to lend your Bijin Lilu Fire (Bijin Lilu Fire) to your grandson. Why not let me borrow the Thousand-Flame Inferno for my friend?” Shan Yuyan (Single Speech Swallow) replied coldly.

At this moment, Shan Yuyan (Single Speech Swallow) had fully discerned the true nature of this grandfather-grandson pair. Her disappointment in them reached its peak. If not for their interference, she and Zheng Xin might have already been blessed by the crowd’s good wishes. There would be no such complications.

Seeing Shan Yuyan (Single Speech Swallow) favoring Luo Tian over them, Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji) nearly lost his nose in anger. He only took a deep breath and glanced at her.

“Wait, why didn’t he use the Thousand-Flame Inferno in the second round?” A Danzong (Danzong) disciple spoke, his face filled with disbelief.

Hearing this disciple’s words, it was as if a firecracker had been lit in the crowd. Their faces reflected disbelief.

“Haha! My brother, you still think cheating is the way to win!” Zheng Xin’s gaze swept over the three sect masters and elders.

Hearing Zheng Xin’s sharp words, even Master Zheng Hongsheng (Zheng Hongsheng) felt a flush of embarrassment. He coughed twice to mask his awkwardness.

“This is the Luo Tian I remember! To humiliate, one must repeatedly strike!” Duan Xingchen (Duan Xingchen) bore a bitter smile.

“What kind of person is this kid? He had a great chance to win in the second round, yet he chose to enter the third!” The crowd was now thoroughly confused about Luo Tian’s true nature.

“Moreover, where did this kid get so many herbs?” The crowd wondered, their eyes turning to Leng Hongcai (Leng Hongcai).

Their gazes naturally fell upon Luo Tian, who had closed his eyes to refine the herbs. They could not fathom why he did so.

Chapter 485: The Elixir’s Trial

“What level of spiritual awareness does this kid possess, daring to refine so many herbs at once?” The crowd stared in awe at Luo Tian, who remained closed-eyed and refining the herbs.

In contrast, Yang Hongguang’s efforts were lackluster. He placed fifty herbs at a time into the cauldron, causing Danzong (Danzong) disciples to feel an ominous premonition.

Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji) watched Luo Tian, his initial unease deepening. He silently prayed: “Hongguang must not lose!”

Luo Tian and Yang Hongguang, however, were unaware of the external thoughts. Both were true prodigies of their time, and during alchemy, they remained calm and undisturbed by external distractions.

As Yang Huanyu (Yang Huanyu) placed the final fifty herbs into the Suiyu Cauldron (Suiyu Cauldron), both men bore expressions of solemnity, their eyes closed as they refined the herbs within their cauldrons.

The onlookers began an uneventful wait, their curiosity intensely stirred. They longed to see what elixirs the two would produce.

“One hour... Two hours…”

Time flowed slowly. Before long, half a day had passed. The time was approaching dusk, yet the crowd showed no impatience, their eyes fixed on the two.

At last, Yang Hongguang’s cauldron made a sound. A thunderous rumble echoed from the Suiyu Cauldron (Suiyu Cauldron), and waves of heat continuously emerged from it.

As the Suiyu Cauldron (Suiyu Cauldron) continued to rumble, the sky above the square gradually darkened. Dark clouds drifted toward the plaza.

“This is a trial cloud! Could Yang Hongguang have crafted a six-star elixir?” Danzong (Danzong) disciples’ faces lit up with joy. They had not expected Yang Hongguang to produce a six-star elixir, one accompanied by an elixir trial.

Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji) observed the trial clouds in the sky, his face displaying satisfaction. At this moment, his heart had finally calmed.

Now, Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji) no longer hoped to win Luo Tian’s Zhenhun Cauldron (Zhenhun Cauldron). He merely wished to preserve the Bijin Lilu Fire (Bijin Lilu Fire) he had brought.

Yang Hongguang, however, proved himself. Though aided by the Suiyu Cauldron (Suiyu Cauldron) and Bijin Lilu Fire (Bijin Lilu Fire), he had crafted a six-star elixir with trial clouds. This demonstrated his alchemical mastery, matching that of some Danzong (Danzong) elders.

Remember, Yang Hongguang was only twenty-seven years old. To be a six-star alchemist at this age was remarkable. In ten years, he would surely ascend to seven stars. Eight-star alchemy was within his reach.

Feeling the trial clouds above, the five senior judges waved their hands, creating a crimson barrier to enclose Luo Tian. This was to prevent him from being disturbed by Yang Hongguang’s lightning trial.

Yang Hongguang now bore an excited expression. He opened his eyes, staring intently at the Suiyu Cauldron (Suiyu Cauldron), his face drenched in sweat. Yet he seemed oblivious to it.

“Boom...” A thunderous sound echoed from both the sky’s trial clouds and Yang Hongguang’s cauldron.

“Now! Let it solidify!” Yang Hongguang roared, his face contorted with madness. He slammed both hands onto the cauldron’s lid.

“Pang!” The lid flew open with a crisp sound. A phoenix-like phantom emerged from the Suiyu Cauldron (Suiyu Cauldron), soaring into the sky. The surrounding air was filled with intense heat.

“Excellent! He has crafted the Nine Heavens Phoenix Xuan Elixir!” Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji) laughed, his face displaying satisfaction.

Danzong (Danzong) disciples bore expressions of fervor as they gazed at the phoenix phantom still lingering in the sky. As Danzong (Danzong) disciples, they understood the rarity of the Nine Heavens Phoenix Xuan Elixir.

Before the crowd could even express their admiration, Yang Hongguang’s back spread two wings—red and a deep shade of blue. His face was filled with fervor as he rushed toward the sky, grabbing the crimson elixir still ascending.

The phoenix phantom expanded under Yang Hongguang’s grasp, transforming into fire-elemental energy that dispersed into the air.

“After several attempts, I’ve finally succeeded! Luo Tian, I wonder what you’ll use to compete with me!” Yang Hongguang sneered at Luo Tian, who remained closed-eyed.

Then, the sky echoed with thunderous roars. A thick lightning bolt rolled through the dark clouds, charging toward Yang Hongguang with a roar.

“Hmph!” Yang Hongguang sneered, gazing at the lightning bolt. His spiritual energy of the initial stage surged forth as he punched.

The crimson fist, infused with wood-elemental spiritual energy, became even more ferocious. It collided with the blue lightning bolt.

The crimson fist and lightning bolt clashed, creating a burst of fireworks in the sky before vanishing into the void.

“This youth will surely become Danzong’s pillar!” The heads of several major sects bore expressions of admiration as they gazed at Yang Hongguang in the sky.

“Hmph! What is he? He’s nothing compared to Luo Tian!” Zheng Xin sneered, his lips curling in disdain.

“Not yet finished!”

“Is it a two-stage lightning trial?” The crowd, seeing the still-dense trial clouds, bore expressions of disbelief.

“This youth must be cultivated carefully. Do not offend him!” Besides the three sect masters, other sect heads bore expressions of shock as they gazed at Yang Hongguang standing proudly in the sky.

“The Danzong (Danzong) has produced a prodigy!” The five senior judges bore expressions of admiration as they gazed at Yang Hongguang in the sky.

“Still more?” Yang Hongguang’s face lit up with joy. He had not expected his first elixir to be a two-stage lightning trial.

“Two-stage lightning trial! I cannot withstand it directly. It seems I must use the Bijin Lilu Fire (Bijin Lilu Fire)!” Yang Hongguang mused, his翠green flame suddenly凝聚 from his palm.

“Boom...” A water-bucket thick lightning bolt, accompanied by thunderous roars, formed into a golden dragon and crashed toward Yang Hongguang.

Yang Hongguang extended his hand, the翠green flame enveloping the golden dragon and burning it away from sight.

“Haha! Luo Tian, I wonder what you’ll use to compete with me!” Yang Hongguang’s long hair fluttered as he gazed at Luo Tian on the ground, his eyes filled with supreme arrogance.

But as Yang Hongguang gazed at Luo Tian, his body trembled. His eyes bore expressions of disbelief.

“Thank you for shielding me from a lightning trial!” Luo Tian opened his eyes, smiling as he gazed at Yang Hongguang in the sky.

“Roar…” As Luo Tian’s words fell, he slammed both hands onto the Zhenhun Cauldron (Zhenhun Cauldron), and a mighty dragon roar echoed into the sky.

Ten chapters uploaded. Tomorrow is the first of the month. Can you all cast your free monthly votes for me? Tomorrow is the first, and I want to climb the monthly vote rankings. It’s only for one day. Just cast that vote on掌阅 (Zhangye)!

Chapter 486: Victory

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Yang Hongguang’s heart sank. His face bore confusion before his lips curled slightly: “Fooling around!”

“The trial clouds have not dispersed!” The crowd was utterly stunned, their faces filled with disbelief as they gazed at the sky’s trial clouds. They showed no signs of dispersing, instead becoming denser.

“What is this situation?”

“Yang Hongguang has crafted a three-stage lightning trial elixir?” Danzong (Danzong) disciples were now completely frenzied, their faces alight with fervor as they gazed at Yang Hongguang in the sky.

“No!” Yang Hongguang’s mind shook. He knew his own worth. A two-stage lightning trial had already surprised him. How could he have crafted a three-stage one?

A golden dragon suddenly rose, rushing toward Yang Hongguang’s front as if to devour him. Seven-colored wings sprouted from Luo Tian’s back, instantly appearing beside the dragon. Two golden elixirs resembling dragon eyes were swiftly snatched into a jade bottle by Luo Tian.

“Good man! Thank you!” Luo Tian’s face bore gratitude as he bowed to Yang Hongguang.

Yang Hongguang’s head momentarily went numb. He recalled Luo Tian had said the same thing before. Yet he could not fathom why Luo Tian’s attitude had changed so drastically.

“I hadn’t expected the elixir trial to descend before the elixir was even complete. Thank you for shielding me from one, otherwise my elixir might have been destroyed by the trial!” Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Yang Hongguang.

“Boom…” Though Luo Tian’s words were soft, they struck the crowd like thunder. Especially the five senior judges, who bore expressions of shock as they gazed at Luo Tian in the sky. They were momentarily speechless.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji) turned pale. At this moment, he finally understood—those elixir trials were not from Yang Hongguang’s elixir, but Luo Tian’s.

“Probably, Luo Tian’s trial descended early. After all, the previous trial had drawn it in,” the head judge spoke softly to explain for everyone.

“Haha!” The three Zheng brothers laughed without restraint, and soon the disciples of Jifeng Valley (Jifeng Valley) joined in laughter.

Danzong (Danzong) disciples, however, turned a pig’s liver color. They wished for a hole to dig themselves into. Previously, they had boasted about Yang Hongguang’s elixir being a two-stage lightning trial. Now, it had become an enormous joke.

Yang Hongguang stood in the sky, nearly spitting blood. His feelings were as if he had eaten excrement.

Thinking of his previous arrogant attitude and lofty demeanor, now he was the biggest joke. Worse still, he had even shielded his opponent from a lightning trial.

If not for his shielding, Luo Tian would have been disturbed while refining the elixir. Not only would the elixir be incomplete, but he might have suffered a backlash.

“Um… will you help me shield the next lightning trial too?” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Yang Hongguang’s face as if about to bleed.

“Shield your mother!” Yang Hongguang mentally cursed. Yet he dared not speak out. He could not be certain if Luo Tian would immediately turn on him, throwing him down before the many sects.

Yang Hongguang’s face turned red. He had no way to deal with Luo Tian, filled with regret. He flew back to the ground in a huff.

At this moment, only Luo Tian remained in the sky. His seven-colored wings fluttered gently behind him as he gazed at the rolling thunderclouds.

“Another lightning trial!” Luo Tian muttered softly, confident.

Now, Luo Tian had no fear of lightning trials. On the contrary, he hoped for them to strike him, refining his body.

“Boom...” Whether it was due to sensing Luo Tian’s strength or the elixir he had crafted being too unconventional, the thunderclouds refused to descend their lightning trial. It seemed they were preparing a fatal strike.

After several heartbeats, the heavy sky finally echoed with a powerful roar. A pale purple dragon lightning descended, carrying terrifying pressure and crashing down.

“Purple Yuan Demon Lightning!” The crowd’s faces bore intense fear as they gazed at the sky’s faintly purple-tinged lightning, shouting in alarm.

“What elixir has this kid crafted to summon Purple Yuan Demon Lightning!” Senior masters of the spiritual energy realm were familiar with Purple Yuan Demon Lightning. They knew its power.

Seeing it was Purple Yuan Demon Lightning, Luo Tian smiled. He clearly remembered the lightning trial that had left an indelible mark on him.

“It’s not as powerful as my previous spiritual energy trial. Do you think it can destroy the elixir I’ve crafted?” Luo Tian soared into the sky, transforming into a seven-colored rainbow and rushing toward the Purple Yuan Demon Lightning.

“What is he doing?”

“Is he going to withstand the lightning trial with his body!”

“He’s mad! Though he has reached spiritual energy stage, Purple Yuan Demon Lightning is not something one can withstand directly!” The crowd shouted in alarm as they watched Luo Tian’s bold move.

Under the crowd's astonished gaze, Luo Tian collided with the purple lightning trial. His body was covered in a faint purple hue.

Ten breaths.

Luo Tian remained within the lightning trial for ten breaths before it dispersed, revealing his somewhat battered figure.

“Nothing more than that!” Luo Tian radiated boundless power toward the sky, as if challenging heaven itself. A faint purple hue surrounded his body.

“Daring to challenge the heavens—this is true cultivation! This is a true prodigy!” Zheng Hongsheng (Zheng Hongsheng) mused, gazing at Luo Tian radiating overwhelming power.

At this moment, all eyes were on Luo Tian in the sky. A sense of helplessness filled their hearts.

“Buzz…” The trial clouds above did not heed Luo Tian. They slowly dispersed, revealing a sky filled with stars.

Silence. This moment was strangely quiet. The crowd stared at Luo Tian in the sky, momentarily speechless, unsure of what words to use to describe him.

“Respected elders, may you declare the result now?” Luo Tian’s calm voice echoed in their ears, bringing them back to reality.

“Do we need to say it?” The crowd sighed inwardly. At this point, anyone could see that Luo Tian had surely won.

“This…” The five senior judges hesitated. They naturally knew the sect masters had agreed to a draw between Luo Tian and Yang Hongguang. Yet they hadn’t expected Luo Tian to craft such an unconventional elixir, a two-stage lightning trial—let alone Purple Yuan Demon Lightning.

“This third round’s contest is won by Luo Tian!” The senior judges, reluctantly, announced the impartial result.

Chapter 487: You Won’t Give It, I’ll Take It

Hearing the senior judges’ announcement, Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji) and his grandson seemed struck by lightning. They were stunned, unable to speak. Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji) felt his mind go blank.

Yang Hongguang, on the other hand, turned pale. This result felt like a resounding slap across his face. It was harder to accept than the humiliation Luo Tian had given him days before. After all, alchemy was his specialty.

To be defeated in one’s most skilled field—this was an indelible disgrace for a prodigy.

“Luo Tian!” Zheng Xin and his brothers, along with Leng Qiuchan (Cold Autumn Cicada), appeared before Luo Tian who had returned to the ground, their faces filled with joy.

“Thank you!” Zheng Xin’s face bore gratitude as he gazed at Luo Tian, his eyes filled with excitement.

“Don’t mention it. Brothers don’t need thanks!” Luo Tian smiled faintly, gazing at Yang Hongguang who was stunned.

Everyone looked at Luo Tian with admiration. This included the heads of over a dozen sects, who also bore smiles.

No one had expected Luo Tian to truly defeat Danzong’s (Danzong) prodigy, especially under the circumstances where obstacles had been set.

Luo Tian carefully separated one of the One Qi Dragon Emperor Pills he had crafted, sealing it in a jade bottle before handing it to Zheng Xin. “This elixir is a gift for your wedding!” he said softly.

“This…” Shan Yuyan (Single Speech Swallow) bore a faint blush. As an alchemist, she knew the rarity of a six-star elixir. She herself had an eight-star elixir on her, a life-saving one left by Danzong (Danzong).

Shan Yuyan could clearly sense how extraordinary the elixir Luo Tian had crafted was. Though it wasn’t valuable to her, it was rare for other sects.

“Take it! One elixir and you think that’s enough? Don’t dream. I know you have more treasures. If I don’t make you part with some, it’ll be a missed opportunity!” Zheng Xin was unreserved. He grabbed the jade bottle and stuffed it into his robe.

Luo Tian bore a bitter smile, inwardly sighing. It seemed he would have to part with many treasures this time. Yet he felt no regret, for compared to the Bijin Lilu Fire (Bijin Lilu Fire) he was about to obtain, these treasures were insignificant.

“Master Yang, Master Genius. It’s time you honored your promise!” Luo Tian sneered at the pale-faced pair.

“Sss…”

“They really dare to confront Danzong!” The crowd bore expressions of shock. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to dare speak to Danzong (Danzong).

Those present were all prominent figures in the Eastern Region. Naturally, they knew the importance of ancestral fire to Danzong (Danzong). If Luo Tian truly obtained it, it meant he had prepared to clash with Danzong (Danzong).

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Leng Hongcai (Leng Hongcai) sighed in his heart. If anyone least wanted to clash with Danzong (Danzong), it was himself, the sect master of Yuling Sect. After all, Luo Tian’s identity was that of a young master of Yuling Sect and the future sect leader.

Compared to Danzong (Danzong), Yuling Sect’s strength was roughly equal. If they clashed, it would be uncertain who would win. However, one thing was certain: Yuling Sect would suffer heavy losses even if it won.

Leng Hongcai was about to speak when Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji)’s crazed voice rang out: “Kid, dare you give it to me?”

“Huh?” Luo Tian heard Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji)’s words. His brows furrowed slightly, and after a moment of contemplation, he understood the situation.

The crowd was stunned. They awaited Luo Tian’s response. If he answered poorly, it could lead to a clash between Danzong (Danzong) and Yuling Sect.

“Hmph… I’ve never let anyone take what is mine!” Luo Tian’s heart sneered.

“Please, Master Yang, honor your previous bet. I’m sure with so many people here, you won’t renege!” Luo Tian spoke coldly, his gaze piercing Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji).

Hearing Luo Tian’s calm words, people turned their gazes to the proud Luo Tian. They didn’t understand why he dared speak so boldly.

“Does he really not fear a clash between the two sects?” The crowd murmured.

“You can fulfill your bet with Hongguang, but I cannot give you the Bijin Lilu Fire (Bijin Lilu Fire). It is Danzong’s ancestral fire, not something I can decide!” Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji) played the role of a scoundrel.

“Playing the scoundrel? No one has ever taken what is mine!” Luo Tian sneered, his gaze cold as he looked at Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji).

“Disgracing Danzong! If I lose, will you renege? If Luo Tian loses and reneges, would you?” Zheng Xin mocked, his gaze filled with disdain as he looked at Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji).

The disciples of Jifeng Valley also laughed loudly, showing no regard for Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji)’s status as a Danzong elder.

Being mocked by so many, Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji)’s face turned red. Yet he had resolved to renege, standing there without speaking.

“Since you won’t give it, I’ll take it myself!” Luo Tian sneered. His feet stirred with wind as he took the sixth step of Fengtian Step (Fengtian Step), instantly appearing before Yang Hongguang, who was stunned. A spiritual energy hand formed and rushed toward him.

“You dare! Hongguang, run!” Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji) roared.

Luo Tian was too fast. Before anyone could react, he appeared before Yang Hongguang, who was stunned.

Zheng Hongsheng and others’ faces changed. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to act so swiftly. By the time they realized, he was already before Yang Hongguang.

“Flee!” Still dazed, Yang Hongguang felt a chill at his ear. He quickly regained his senses, realizing he was no match for Luo Tian. His feet moved slightly to escape.

But Luo Tian would not grant him the chance. A sneer crossed his face as he unleashed the Miesheng Fist (Miesheng Fist), striking Yang Hongguang.

Yang Hongguang spat blood, his appearance instantly aged to thirty. He was thrown backward.

Yet Luo Tian did not grant him the chance to flee. A spiritual energy hand stopped his momentum, grabbing Yang Hongguang in its grip.

Too fast—Luo Tian’s actions were too swift. Some bone-destroying stage disciples felt it was just a blink of an eye before the spiritual energy initial stage Yang Hongguang was captured by Luo Tian.

“Master Yang, now will you give it or not?” Luo Tian smiled playfully, scanning the blood-stained face of Yang Hongguang. He swung his hand and slapped Yang Hongguang’s pale face.

“Smack…” The crisp sound of the slap echoed in people’s ears, making Yang Hongguang’s face even paler.

Seeing Yang Hongguang captured by Luo Tian, so pitifully wounded, Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji)’s face darkened to the point of dripping water.

Chapter 488: Extraction

“This is the first slap. It’s part of our bet!” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji), whose face was dark with fury.

“Smack… smack…” Before anyone could react, Luo Tian delivered two more slaps. His face bore coldness as he gazed at Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji), then looked at the blood-stained face of Yang Hongguang.

“How does it feel? I’m sure you’ve done this countless times before. Want to slap my face? Don’t forget your own palm isn’t strong enough!” Luo Tian spoke boldly, his gaze cold.

“Luo Tian, let’s talk calmly. Release Yang Hongguang first, and everything can be resolved!” Zheng Hongsheng (Zheng Hongsheng) and others spoke, fearing the situation would escalate.

“Father, it’s already this far. There’s no point in talking now!” Zheng Bowen (Zheng Bowen) approached Zheng Hongsheng (Zheng Hongsheng), his face bearing a smile.

In contrast, the disciples of Yuling Sect who had come seemed to be infected by Luo Tian’s aura. They felt they were superior to disciples of other sects, their eyes burning with intensity as they gazed at Luo Tian standing there.

Leng Hongcai (Leng Hongcai) sighed in his heart, his face bearing contemplation. He had already prepared for the worst—clashing with Danzong (Danzong).

“Luo Tian, don’t push it too far. If you release Hongguang now, I’ll pretend nothing happened!” Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji)’s face darkened as he threatened.

“Haha… wanting the Bijin Lilu Fire (Bijin Lilu Fire)… you’re dreaming!” Yang Hongguang panted, his voice weak.

“Since you both refuse, I’ll have to take it myself!” Luo Tian ignored their words and pulled Yang Hongguang before him.

“Come out!” Luo Tian roared, and a powerful suction force emanated from his hands. The crowd was stunned.

“Buzz…” Yang Hongguang’s entire body was clutched by Luo Tian, his face contorted in pain. His robes fluttered violently.

As the suction force from Luo Tian’s hands grew stronger, a green flame slowly emerged from Yang Hongguang’s body.

A scorching heat radiated from Luo Tian, the green fire glowing ominously under the darkening night sky.

“Die!” Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji)’s face bore a sinister expression. At this point, he could no longer remain seated. His body moved like lightning toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian had been observing Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji)’s movements. Almost instantly after Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji) moved, Luo Tian grabbed Yang Hongguang and appeared in the sky.

“Old dog! If you truly are willing to let your grandson die, I’ll grant it!” Luo Tian’s gaze finally bore a killing intent as he looked at Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji), who was rushing toward him again.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji) stopped. His face was grim. If he had to choose between his grandson and the Bijin Lilu Fire (Bijin Lilu Fire), he would choose Yang Hongguang, even if it meant facing the sect’s anger upon returning.

Shan Yuyan (Single Speech Swallow) bore an expression of pity. After all, Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji) represented Danzong (Danzong), the one who had spoken for her father. Moreover, she had received kindness from Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji) in her childhood.

Luo Tian soared into the air. Seeing Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji) had stopped, he smiled and increased his suction force.

Yang Hongguang’s face was almost twisted. He felt his soul being uncontrollably pulled out, as if trying to escape his body. The Bijin Lilu Fire (Bijin Lilu Fire) within him, which was not originally his, rapidly flowed into Luo Tian’s front.

“Come out!” Luo Tian roared, his voice filled with boundless authority.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian’s words fell, the entire sky seemed to ignite. The green fire surged into the night sky, illuminating it.

Luo Tian ignored Yang Hongguang, who was weakened to the point of collapse. He smiled, gazing at the towering fire and tossed Yang Hongguang into his Naling Bag (Naling Bag).

“He really did extract the Bijin Lilu Fire!” The crowd bore expressions of fear as they gazed at the green fire in the sky.

“Hmph, do you think we Danzong’s ancestral fire is so easily taken?” Yang Kaiji (Yang Kaiji)’s face bore shock, but he dared not act rashly.

The towering Bijin Lilu Fire (Bijin Lilu Fire) burned slowly, its scorching heat even making Luo Tian feel a hint of fear.

“Luo Tian, quickly take it. If it’s left to develop freely, it will become a disaster!” Shan Yuyan spoke in a whisper, urging Luo Tian.

Zheng Hongsheng (Zheng Hongsheng) bore a bitter expression. He took out his jade token and began contacting Jifeng Valley’s (Jifeng Valley) resources. If the Bijin Lilu Fire (Bijin Lilu Fire) were to burn freely, no one in the crowd would be able to control it.
