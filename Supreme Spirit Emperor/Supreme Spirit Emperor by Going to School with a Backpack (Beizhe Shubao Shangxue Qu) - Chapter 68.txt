Everyone was watching the couple embracing, their faces displaying strange expressions.

Yet the two seemed utterly oblivious to the presence of others, hugging tightly as if the world around them had vanished, leaving no room for a third person.

Chapter 333: Exposure

Chapter 333: Exposure

Luo Tian clutched the person in his arms, greedily inhaling their familiar scent, a soft glow spreading across his face.

"Brother, it's been such a long time!" A cheerful voice finally rang out from behind him, shattering their quiet moment.

Hearing the voice, both of them slightly separated. Though their faces were obscured by veils, people could still clearly sense the redness beneath the fabric.

"Kid, it's been a while. Your strength has grown," Luo Tian patted the approaching man on the back, a light smile playing on his lips.

At that moment, Luo Tian's heart was filled with exhilaration. He had never imagined encountering the person he'd dreamed of seeing in his wildest fantasies here. Though their faces were hidden by veils, the moment he heard their voices, Luo Tian immediately recognized them as Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei.

Two years had passed, and Gu Lei now carried a touch of maturity, while Gu Qianxue's presence felt even more refined.

Gu Lei was also scrutinizing Luo Tian carefully. Two years had made Luo Tian significantly stronger, though his face wasn't the same as before, his voice remained unchanged.

Thus, Gu Qianxue had immediately recognized Luo Tian upon hearing his first words. However, both were puzzled—why was Luo Tian still stuck at the Ninth Stage of Body Tempering?

They knew Luo Tian's talent was extraordinary. At that moment, they had already reached the Mid-Formation Bone stage, yet Luo Tian remained at the Ninth Stage of Body Tempering. They recalled that two years ago, he had already been at this stage.

Nearly two years had passed, yet Luo Tian remained stagnant. Though his aura was formidable, the fact that his cultivation level hadn't advanced left them skeptical.

"Your strength has definitely grown, but what about you? Why are you still lingering at the Ninth Stage of Body Tempering? How did you end up in the Eastern Domain?" Gu Lei's voice, muffled by his black veil, rang out.

Hearing Gu Lei's words, Luo Tian felt a jolt of alarm. He realized his identity might have been exposed as he glanced at the curious stares around him.

"Brother Luo Tian, aren't you from the Eastern Domain?" Huo Zhiyong's face bore a questioning expression as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"Of course, you've been deceiving us all along! You're not from the Eastern Domain at all. You're not even a prodigy of Yuling Sect! Tell us who you are and why you infiltrated Yuling Sect!" Leng Fei's voice was cold as he stared at Luo Tian.

"Everyone, I'll explain everything later. For now, could you let me handle this matter first?" Luo Tian bowed respectfully to the group, his voice resolute as he turned toward the two others accompanying Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei.

Upon noticing Luo Tian's gaze upon them, the man at Mid-Formation Bone stage frowned and addressed Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei with a cold tone: "You two, don't forget I hired you. Do you really think I won't report this to your superiors?"

"Go to hell... You don't have the right to interfere!" Gu Lei's voice carried a domineering aura as he retorted loudly.

"You forget this is the Eastern Domain, not the Southern!" The other black-cloaked man's face twisted with anger as he issued a threat.

"So what?" Luo Tian turned to Huo Zhiyong and spoke resolutely: "Everyone, I'm not from the Eastern Domain. I hail from the Northern Domain!"

"The Northern Domain? Luo Tian! We should have realized it sooner. How foolish we were to believe this man was Yuling Sect's Luo Tian!" Huo Zhiyong sighed, his voice laced with admiration.

"Indeed, he's Luo Tian from the Northern Domain! All those tales about him in other regions are true! Oh my, I've actually seen Luo Tian himself—and even flirted with him!" Su Yewu clutched her chest, astonishment etched on her face.

In the Northern Domain, Luo Tian was a household name; even those with connections in other regions knew of his existence.

"Ah, so you're Luo Tian!" The man at Late-Formation Bone stage's face darkened as he regarded Luo Tian, clearly taking him seriously.

"Such a lowly cultivation level—Ninth Stage of Body Tempering—and yet he's been hyped up so much. I suppose the Northern Domain really has no talent!" Someone scoffed coldly.

Hearing that man's sneer, everyone turned their gaze toward him with expressions of disdain.

Huo Zhiyong and Su Yewu knew well the terrifying power Luo Tian could unleash. Even in the Governor's mansion of Lishui City, he had held back some techniques. Now that his identity was exposed, their eyes brimmed with anticipation as they watched the legendary figure from the Northern Domain.

"Of course, my arrival here in the Eastern Domain was purely coincidental. As for why I infiltrated your group, it's simply to enter Kunlun Mountain and access the portal back to the Northern Domain. Whether you believe it or not is your choice!" Luo Tian ignored the taunts, his expression indifferent as he explained to Huo Zhiyong and the others.

"Ah, so he's been hiding his identity all along—and perhaps even stronger!" Ding Xiaoyan's face finally showed a bitter expression. She had never imagined that the youth she'd been provoking was none other than Luo Tian, the legendary figure of the Northern Domain.

Dong Xingjian also felt regretful. If he had known the one he'd provoked was Luo Tian, he would never have treated him so harshly. This formidable young man had proven himself once again—but regret was fleeting, and soon his madness returned.

"We believe you're telling the truth. I've heard of your deeds in the Northern Domain. Rest assured, we won't reveal your name. As for the rest, we don't wish to get involved. How you return to the Northern Domain is your business," Huo Zhiyong spoke, his voice carrying weight as he was the eldest among them. Though not the strongest in cultivation, his words held authority.

"Thank you," Luo Tian bowed respectfully, casting a meaningful glance at the group.

"Haha, since you're not a disciple of Yuling Sect, this makes things easier! Killing him is as simple as that!" The man at Mid-Formation Bone stage smiled playfully, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Then how did you end up in the Eastern Domain?" Luo Tian ignored the man's taunts and turned to Gu Lei and Gu Qianxue.

"Nothing much—just a job. We were sent to kill you!" Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei's faces bore an odd expression as they replied.

"Uh..." Luo Tian was momentarily speechless at their words.

Dong Xingjian had regained his composure, realizing the plan might fail. His brother and the person he'd hired might not succeed in killing Luo Tian. He had witnessed Luo Tian's terrifying attack before; now, with the two men turning against him, it was like adding insult to injury.

Realizing this, Dong Xingjian quickly sent a mental message to the man at Mid-Formation Bone stage, urging him to leave.

Hearing his brother's mental call, Dong Xingxie's eyes flashed with disdain. His thoughts formed into a voice within Dong Xingjian's mind: "A mere Northern Domain prodigy. Don't take it seriously. Though there was an unexpected twist, the outcome remains unchanged."

Hearing his brother's words, Dong Xingjian's eyes brimmed with anxiety. He knew his brother's arrogance was insurmountable; convincing him would be impossible.

Chapter 334: Collision

Chapter 334: Collision

"Enough, let's deal with these two first. Then we can catch up!" Luo Tian smiled, his gaze dark as he looked at the other two black-cloaked men.

"Regardless of how famous you are in the Northern Domain, the Southern isn't yours!" The black-cloaked man brandished a long sword, his face twisted with menace as he glared at Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue.

"Since you're so stubborn, there's no need for further cooperation. I'll report your actions to your superiors!" The man at Late-Formation Bone stage glared at Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei, clearly angry at their sudden betrayal.

"I think... you won't have the chance!" Gu Qianxue's voice was calm as she spoke, her face cold with murderous intent.

Others watching the four black-cloaked men turn on each other were visibly surprised.

"Come on, it's been a while since I've fought seriously. Watch and enjoy!" Luo Tian smirked, gazing at the two men.

Hearing Luo Tian's boastful words, everyone wore strange expressions. They watched a Ninth Stage of Body Tempering youth dare to speak so boldly against two masters—one at Late-Formation Bone, the other at Mid-Formation Bone. The two black-cloaked men scrutinized Luo Tian carefully.

"Kid, don't be so foolish. It seems Northern Domain prodigies are all fools!" The man at Mid-Formation Bone stage sneered, laughing loudly.

"Despicable creature, even your face is hidden!" Luo Tian snorted, stepping forward toward the man.

"Be careful, this kid isn't simple!" The man at Late-Formation Bone stage frowned, addressing his companion.

"Be careful," Gu Qianxue's eyes, visible through her veil, carried a hint of concern. Yet she didn't intervene; she trusted Luo Tian's judgment. Even after two years, her trust in him had not wavered.

"Brother, if you can't handle it, just say so!" Gu Lei laughed, crossing his arms and standing aside.

Huo Zhiyong and the others saw Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei's confidence, their worries eased. Clearly, Luo Tian's relationship with them was extraordinary—any fool could see it.

"Phoenix Rebirth Dragon Seal!" Luo Tian barked out the incantation.

At this moment, his state was uncertain—whether he could even escape their pursuit was unclear. He activated the Phoenix Rebirth Dragon Seal, pushing himself to his absolute limit.

Golden light flared as Longbao's figure appeared in the crowd, his face cautious as he assessed the two black-cloaked men. His instincts told him they bore hostility toward Luo Tian.

"Longbao, stretch your legs and pick one!" Luo Tian smiled as he addressed Longbao.

"I'll take the big one. He looks tougher than that puppet!" Longbao, unable to judge cultivation levels by size alone, pointed at the man at Late-Formation Bone stage.

Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei, seeing the boy beside Luo Tian, wore solemn expressions. They were no longer the weaklings at a few stages of Body Tempering who once relied on Luo Tian's protection.

Now, both had earned reputations in the Southern Domain's faction-ridden lands; no one dared underestimate them. Their heightened senses immediately sensed the immense power within Longbao's tiny body.

"Boom..." A deep rumbling echoed from Luo Tian's body as, under Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei's astonished gazes, his cultivation surged to Mid-Formation Bone.

"Indeed, Luo Tian isn't at this level!" Gu Lei nodded with a confident expression.

Gu Qianxue also gave a slight nod. She knew Luo Tian could never be at Ninth Stage of Body Tempering; if someone told her he had reached the Yuanling stage, she would believe it. After all, his name was Luo Tian.

"Indeed, he's got some moves. But this isn't enough to take me down!" The man at Mid-Formation Bone stage sneered, brandishing his long sword toward Luo Tian.

The man at Late-Formation Bone stage also drew his sword, his gaze heavy with caution as he eyed Longbao.

"Both of them use swords. Could they be from Tianjian Sect?" Huo Zhiyong murmured, his eyes on Dong Xingjian. Rumors said the Dong family had significant ties to Tianjian Sect.

Dong Xingjian, seeing the group's gaze on him, felt his face darken. He knew even a fool could see the connection between these two and Tianjian Sect—after all, Tianjian Sect had recruited nearly every sword-wielding master in the Southern Domain.

Gu Lei and Gu Qianxue knew these two were from Tianjian Sect, but they couldn't inform Luo Tian. They had sworn blood oaths when accepting the mission not to reveal their employer's identity.

"Ah, Tianjian Sect," Luo Tian mused coldly, his gaze flicking toward Dong Xingjian in the corner.

"Then let's finish this!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, his spear—Lietian—surging with five-colored spiritual energy. He lunged at the man at Mid-Formation Bone stage without hesitation.

"Five-colored spiritual energy! He's definitely a Five Elements Body!"

"Yes, his speed is beyond my comprehension!" Huo Zhiyong and the others marveled as they watched Luo Tian.

"Haha, you're in for it now! I'm Longbao, and today you're done!" Longbao laughed, his tiny feet sprinting forward as he dashed toward the man at Late-Formation Bone stage.

Seeing Luo Tian and Longbao each find their opponents, Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei wore interested expressions. They wanted to see just how strong Luo Tian had become after two years.

"Boom..." The collision of fists between Luo Tian and the man at Mid-Formation Bone stage echoed loudly.

"Step back, both of them!" Luo Tian's face showed a hint of surprise; he hadn't expected someone at Mid-Formation Bone to block his punch.

The black-cloaked man, on the other hand, felt a shockwave through his body. He could sense the immense power within Luo Tian's body. His entire arm felt numb from the impact.

"Interesting. Use your sword, then. You're still no match for me!" Luo Tian's expression was playful as he pointed his spear at the man.

"As you wish," the black-cloaked man sneered, brandishing his sword. His aura seemed to change completely, radiating a sharp, sky-piercing edge of锋利.

Chapter 335: Dragon-Cutting

Chapter 335: Dragon-Cutting

"Finally, something worth my time!" Luo Tian's face was cold as golden serpents surged forth. The golden long snakes lunged at the black-cloaked man, biting hungrily.

"Lo Tian hasn't improved much in two years. His cultivation has increased, but his techniques are still the same! Maybe we should gift him a couple of Xuan-grade martial arts later!" Gu Lei frowned as he watched Luo Tian still use the Golden Snake Frenzy.

A humming sound echoed, and golden sword energy shot toward Luo Tian like a meteor.

"This sword energy is incredibly sharp! What kind of sword is this? I feel like I've seen it before!" Huo Zhiyong's face showed confusion as he gazed at the long sword radiating infinite golden light. A royal aura spread from the small mountain foot, filling the air.

"I remember now! It's the Wu Nian Royal Sword!" Su Yewu's alluring eyes widened, her face filled with disbelief.

"Wu Nian Royal Sword! Dong Xingxie!" Leng Fei's eyes darkened as he whispered the name.

"Dong Xingjian, if you don't explain clearly today, you won't leave!" Huo Zhiyong and the others shouted in unison, surrounding Dong Xingjian and Ding Xiaoyan.

"Correct, I sent my brother here. So what? My target was only Luo Tian. I never intended to kill you all. It was just a scare tactic, after all, Luo Tian's identity was that of Yuling Sect's prodigy!" Dong Xingjian explained.

"Despicable!"
"Shameless!" The group's faces bore disdain as they looked at Dong Xingjian, shocked he'd resort to hiring assassins.

"I'm shameless. I suppose none of you want this demon to exist in the world, do you? With his presence, we're all crushed under his shadow. Don't you want him dead?" Dong Xingjian's face was wild as he pointed at Luo Tian in the battle.

The thunderous sound of collisions echoed from Luo Tian and Dong Xingxie's bodies, a look of seriousness on Luo Tian's face. Though Dong Xingxie was weaker than Yang Huanyu and Li Xiuping, he still posed a challenge.

"Ah, so you're his brother!" Luo Tian's voice carried a cold edge of murder, his words like a winter wind that struck Dong Xingxie's heart.

"So what? You're strong, but to defeat me with this sword is still difficult. Let's compromise—let me and my brother go, and we'll never bother you again!" Dong Xingxie's face was fierce. His earlier contempt for Luo Tian had vanished, his tone now more resolute.

Luo Tian's pressure was too great for him; he knew defeat was only a matter of time. Not fighting Luo Tian meant never knowing his true strength.

"Unbelievable, even Dong Xingxie with the Wu Nian Royal Sword is subdued by Luo Tian. This fully unleashed Luo Tian truly is terrifying!" Huo Zhiyong's face was bitter.

"How about it, Huo Brother? You've seen Luo Tian's strength. Let's team up and take him down..." Dong Xingjian's face was fierce as he looked at Luo Tian.

"Go to hell..."
"Don't be so shameless..."
"Do you think we're like you, so despicable? We can't beat Luo Tian, but at least we won't use underhanded methods. We'll strive to surpass him!" Huo Zhiyong, Su Yewu, and the others scoffed.

Ding Xiaoyan's face showed disappointment upon hearing Dong Xingjian's words. Dong Xingjian had become unrecognizable to her. Her body instinctively moved slightly away from him.

Seeing their disdainful gazes, even Ding Xiaoyan had kept a distance, Dong Xingjian sneered and brandished his sword. Though not as strong as the previous Longxuan Sword, it was still an Xuan-grade初级 sword.

"You don't want to go? I'll go myself!" Dong Xingjian's face was fierce as he shouted, rushing toward Luo Tian and Dong Xingxie's battlefield.

"Kid, just stay still! Why bother? A trash like you wants to challenge Luo Tian?" Gu Lei's face was playful as he appeared before Dong Xingjian.

"Kill!" Dong Xingjian, furious at Gu Lei and Gu Qianxue's betrayal, had forgotten his injuries. He ignored that Gu Lei was at Mid-Formation Bone stage and lunged toward him with his sword.

"Die!" Gu Lei's face flashed coldly, his body radiating purple energy as he rushed toward Dong Xingjian.

The thunderous sound of their collision echoed constantly.

Yet people had no interest in watching their duel; they focused on Luo Tian and Dong Xingxie's battlefield, faces filled with awe.

Within a few breaths, Dong Xingxie was battered and wounded, his body covered in numerous injuries. Though not fatal, compared to Luo Tian, he looked like a beggar.

"Dragon-Cutting Sword Technique, Concentrated Blade Energy!" Dong Xingxie finally forced himself to use his martial art, his face wild.

Luo Tian sneered: "This Concentrated Blade Energy is clever, but it's useless against me. I heard you can perform the third move. Let's see it!"

Luo Tian's hands shifted, forming the Five Elements Rebirth Human King Seal. A terrifying wave of energy smashed through the blade energy formed in the sky.

"Strong! Why do I feel no desire to challenge him at all?" Huo Zhiyong's face was shocked as he watched the five-colored great seal in the sky, his voice trembling.

"Indeed, this seal is much stronger than the one Luo Tian used before!" Leng Fei's eyes glowed with admiration.

"I wish I could have a child with him!" Su Yewu's face was melancholic as she gazed at Luo Tian, then sighed while looking at Gu Qianxue standing there with a radiant expression.

"Indeed, you're still you!" Gu Qianxue's face was filled with relief. Though she had initially doubted Luo Tian at Ninth Stage of Body Tempering, thinking he'd fallen into despair after she and Gu Lei left, now it was clear she had been wrong.

"Since you want to see the third move, I'll grant it!" Seeing his Concentrated Blade Energy easily blocked by Luo Tian, Dong Xingxie's face was wild with desperation. He decided to fight for his life.

He slashed his palm, blood staining the golden sword red. The golden light surged again, and Dong Xingxie's face was wild with hatred: "This is what you forced me to do!"

Dong Xingxie wielded the Wu Nian Royal Sword, moving it with precision in the air. Golden sword energy radiated sharpness from the blade, as if it could pierce through everything.

"Dragon-Cutting!"
Dong Xingxie roared, swinging the golden sword energy toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 336: Accepting the Blow

Chapter 336: Accepting the Blow

The golden sword technique, imbued with terrifying pressure from Dong Xingxie's continuous movements, seemed to carve through space. Though its speed appeared slow, it suddenly appeared above Luo Tian's head and crashed down.

"Is this the third move of Dragon-Cutting?" Huo Zhiyong's face was filled with awe as he watched the golden sword energy that seemed to split the entire Duanyouya. His face was stunned.

"It's said that Dong Family's ancestor used this third move to kill a dragon clan member, hence the name Dragon-Cutting! The rumors were true—Dong Xingxie has indeed mastered this move!" Leng Fei's usually cold eyes glowed with admiration as he watched the golden sword energy image in the sky.

Feeling the pressure of the sword technique above him, Luo Tian's face finally showed a look of seriousness. Though he was at his maximum strength now.

But he could sense the sword technique's power and sharpness. The terrifying fluctuation meant that dodging was the only option; to fight it head-on would result in death or injury.

"Evade..."
Luo Tian's body moved, vanishing from the spot and appearing tens of feet away.

"Trying to run? Dream on! This sword technique has my blood infused into it, giving it a touch of sentience. Wherever you run, it will follow. Unless you sever my head, even if you flee to the ends of the earth, it will chase after you!" Dong Xingxie's face was pale; using a drop of blood had drained him.

"Can't escape?" Luo Tian, hearing Dong Xingxie's words, looked at the golden sword energy again and murmured softly.

"Since I can't escape, then I'll accept it!" Luo Tian sneered and gazed at the descending Dragon-Cutting sword technique.

"Next time, even against a Body Tempering stage opponent, I'll fight with all my might. I won't give them any chance to breathe! Otherwise, the trouble will be on me!" Luo Tian resolved in his heart. He waved his hand and summoned the Zhenhun Cauldron before him.

"What is this thing!" Huo Zhiyong and the others' faces showed shock as they gazed at the large cauldron with green patterns, radiating a heavy aura.

"This is definitely a Terracotta-grade item! Otherwise, I wouldn't feel even the slightest tremor!" Leng Fei's face was equally shocked.

As soon as the Zhenhun Cauldron appeared, Luo Tian didn't hesitate and dove into its bottom, smiling at everyone.

"This cauldron is quite good! It must be a high-grade Terracotta artifact!" Gu Lei punched back Dong Xingjian, his face showing admiration. He had intended to give Luo Tian something, but instead, Luo Tian produced the Zhenhun Cauldron. This item would be a treasure in the Yumen Sect.

Under the group's shocked gazes, the massive sword energy struck the Zhenhun Cauldron with a thunderous sound.

Even those at the Initial Bone stage were stunned by the impact, their ears ringing.

"This sword energy is strong enough to rival a Terracotta-grade martial art! Truly, it's no wonder this third move of the Dong Family's Dragon-Cutting Sword Technique has been mastered by so few! This is even more powerful when wielded at the Mid-Formation Bone stage. If it were mastered by a Yuanling stage master, its power would be even greater!" Huo Zhiyong marveled.

Seeing the sword energy's impact, the entire Duanyou Cliff trembled, rocks flying and scattering around the group. The group was amazed.

Gu Qianxue's brows furrowed slightly. She could sense the destructive, world-destroying nature of the Dragon-Cutting sword energy. Without using her secret weapon, even she wouldn't dare to face it head-on. Her heart was slightly worried about Luo Tian's safety.

Though the bronze cauldron gave a strange feeling, Luo Tian's situation clearly wasn't under control. Gu Qianxue was concerned.

A cloud of dust rose around the Zhenhun Cauldron, sparks flying everywhere, making Gu Qianxue anxious about Luo Tian's safety.

Under the people's expectant gazes, the dust gradually cleared, revealing the green cauldron standing steadily in their sight.

In awe, people watched the bronze cauldron standing proudly in the world, as if a king. A sense of disdain radiated from its body into people's hearts.

"Impossible, it has no damage at all?" Huo Zhiyong stared blankly at the cauldron, his face filled with disbelief.

"This attack was truly formidable!" Luo Tian's voice echoed from within the cauldron, resonating in Dong Xingxie's heart.

Seeing the cauldron withstand his Dragon-Cutting sword energy without a single scratch, Dong Xingxie's mouth twitched.

The Dragon-Cutting sword technique was Dong Xingxie's strongest move, even infused with a drop of blood. Yet it had done no harm to Luo Tian's hair.

"Terracotta-grade! Definitely Terracotta-high grade! This cauldron is rare even in top sects!" Leng Fei's face was shocked as he looked at the Zhenhun Cauldron.

"Dong Xingxie has trouble now! He was never a match for Luo Tian to begin with. Now, after losing a drop of blood, what does he have left to fight Luo Tian?" Su Yewu's eyes gleamed with excitement as she watched the man emerging from the bronze cauldron.

"Ah..." Gu Qianxue slightly raised her hand, then let it fall. If Luo Tian had suffered even a minor injury, she would have delivered a fatal blow to Dong Xingxie.

"Consume... Soul... Seal!" Luo Tian's lips curled slightly, his cold words echoing from his mouth.

In an instant, a spiritual awareness seal formed, radiating an invisible but terrifying pressure toward Dong Xingxie's pale face.

Feeling the invisible pressure, Dong Xingxie felt a bad premonition. Golden energy spread under his feet, golden bones on his legs radiating bright light.

His speed reached its peak. Dong Xingxie's face showed a struggle; he knew if he was hit, his fate would be dire.

"Trying to run? I enjoyed the chase earlier! Now you'll taste what it's like to be chased by a martial art!" Luo Tian's lips curled slightly, the Lietian spear humming as it rested in his hand.

"Five Elements Rebirth, Golden Snake Frenzy!" Luo Tian barked out the incantation. Five golden long snakes converged, forming a golden dragon that roared with power, rushing toward the path in front of Dong Xingxie.

"Dammit, the way is blocked!" Dong Xingxie cursed under his breath, his face showing struggle.

Before Dong Xingxie stood two choices: continue forward and be struck by the terrifying long snakes, or be hit from behind by the terrifying fluctuation.

"Brace yourself!" Dong Xingxie gritted his teeth, summoning another drop of blood. It surged through his body, strengthening him as he lunged toward the golden dragon ahead.

"Boom..." The golden dragon collided with Dong Xingxie's body, sending him flying backward and crashing into the mountain of Duanyou Cliff.

Chapter 337: The Reappearance of the Flame Dragon Hand

Chapter 337: The Reappearance of the Flame Dragon Hand

The thunderous sound echoed from all directions, shaking Duanyou Cliff's massive mountain three times. The deafening roar filled people's ears as the dust that had just cleared returned to their sight.

"Ah..." Huo Zhiyong and the others inhaled sharply, watching Luo Tian standing proudly with his Lietian spear.

"Is this the fully unleashed Luo Tian? This attack must have left Dong Xingxie severely injured!" Su Yewu marveled, her eyes fixed on Luo Tian.

"It should be over," Luo Tian smiled slightly.

Previously, Dong Xingxie had wasted a drop of blood to attack him. Now, after being struck by Luo Tian's Five Elements Rebirth Golden Snake Frenzy, he was certain Dong Xingxie would be severely wounded—perhaps even dead.

"Ugh, it hurts!" Just as people were in awe, Longbao's voice rang out, drawing their attention back to the battlefield between Longbao and the man at Late-Formation Bone stage.

At this moment, the man's veil had fallen off, revealing a face marked with bruises and dark circles. He looked about thirty years old.

Longbao was hopping left and right, his tiny fists swinging repeatedly. Each punch carried immense power, striking the young man with a resounding "thud."

The young man was filled with frustration. Longbao's speed was fast, and his punches were powerful enough to hit flesh. Even though he was at Late-Formation Bone stage, he had to dodge every punch and couldn't fight back.

"Is he even human?" The young man thought angrily.

He hadn't used a single martial art yet—not because he didn't want to, but because he had no opportunity. Longbao's speed was too fast; even if he wanted to use a martial art, it would take at least one breath.

But in that single breath, Longbao's tiny fists had already landed three or four times on his body.

Eventually, the young man gave up and decided to fight with brute force instead. After all, he had a high-grade Xuan-level sword and was at Late-Formation Bone stage. He should have the advantage.

But he miscalculated again. Longbao didn't fear his sword at all. A single strike from the sword only made the little creature cry out in pain, but it was unaffected and even more enraged. His punches became faster and fiercer.

"Annoying..." The young man felt the first time in his life that he was so annoyed. He couldn't fight back, forced to endure the blows. What infuriated him most was that this little bastard only hit his face!

"I'm at least a Late-Formation Bone master. In Tianjian Sect, I was one of the top prodigies. Could you at least show me some respect?" The young man's inner voice cried out, but he still swung his sword.

"Yah... this iron plate hurts!" Longbao was struck on the arm, leaving a white mark. He winced in pain.

Huo Zhiyong and the others watched Longbao's antics, their mouths twitching. That was a high-grade Xuan-level sword wielded by a Late-Formation Bone master. This little kid had no injuries at all—what was he made of?

Gu Qianxue, seeing Longbao calmly dealing with a Late-Formation Bone master, narrowed her eyes slightly. She wondered about the boy's true origin.

Luo Tian smiled, inwardly sighing: "The Dragon Clan truly has unique blessings. Even a Late-Formation Bone master or a Terracotta-grade martial art would struggle to harm Longbao!"

The man at Late-Formation Bone stage, seeing Luo Tian's battlefield had ended, naturally sensed Luo Tian's strength.

His lips twitched slightly as he sighed inwardly. These two were even more terrifying than expected. Dong Xingxie, a prodigy of Tianjian Sect, had been defeated by Luo Tian in less than half a minute.

At this moment, the young man had no desire to deal with Dong Xingjian. He knew if Luo Tian turned his attention to him, he might also end up here today. The thought made him decide to retreat.

"Trying to run?" Luo Tian's spiritual awareness sensed Dong Xingxie's movements, his eyes showing surprise.

Though Luo Tian knew the attack wouldn't kill Dong Xingxie, he hadn't expected him to have energy left for escape.

At this moment, Dong Xingxie had no desire to fight Luo Tian anymore. The loss of two drops of blood had severely wounded him. Without medicine, even a month wouldn't allow him to recover. He had truly realized the terror of Luo Tian.

In the dust, Dong Xingjian didn't hesitate. He transformed a drop of blood into energy, channeling it all into his golden-element bones beneath his feet. He knew this was the only chance to escape; otherwise, he wouldn't have any opportunity at all.

With a powerful kick off the ground, his Mid-Formation Bone cultivation surged fully. His lips bled as he transformed into a golden flash, escaping the dust.

Luo Tian's lips curled slightly. His hands quickly changed positions as he sighed: "Whether you escape or not depends on your luck!"

"Luo Tian, he's escaping!" Su Yewu and the others shouted urgently. They knew if Dong Xingxie escaped today, they would be targeted by him when entering Kunlun Mountain. They didn't want Dong Xingxie to escape.

On the other hand, since their homes were in the Eastern Domain, they couldn't attack Dong Xingxie. Tianjian Sect disciples weren't easy to kill; they could only hope Luo Tian would stop Dong Xingxie.

Luo Tian's face showed a hint of seriousness. He wasn't sure if this move would succeed, even though he had practiced it countless times in his mind.

"Flame Dragon Hand!" Luo Tian sneered, and the Flame Dragon Hand shot forward.

A red dragon roared as it flew toward Dong Xingxie, blocking his escape route.
