“Grrr…” The three-headed dog raised its three massive heads and roared skyward. Black lightning, boundless cold air, and toxic fumes erupted from its three mouths, filling the heavens and earth. The Ancient Clans’ people were instantly swept away in droves.

“Watch where you’re aiming—don’t harm your own people!” Luo Tian’s expression darkened as he watched the Ancient Clans fall. The Hell Dog was an active volcano; a single breath could clear a crowd.

“Let’s go, Xiaohei!” Luo Tian patted the massive head of his companion and spoke softly, watching the two escapees.

“Xiao… Xiaohei…” The people trembled as they gazed at the black figure. Even Fu Xingyang’s lips twitched in disbelief. Who could have imagined such a monstrous creature given such an ordinary name by Luo Tian?

“Grrr…” The three-headed dog ignored the murmurs, its form transforming into a bolt of black lightning. It vanished from sight with Luo Tian in tow.

“Damn it!” The middle-aged man of the Feather Clan turned pale. Who could remain unshaken when pursued by such a terrifying entity?

“Grrr…” As the warrior fled across Star Moon Clan territory, a deep growl echoed behind him, turning his face ashen.

In an instant, a malevolent aura seeped into his soul. A maw of blood loomed behind him, its silver eyes radiating cold as it lunged to tear him apart.

“Crunch…” Before the Feather Clan warrior could react, his body was seized by one of the three heads. Crimson tongue licked at the blood on its maw, and the Feather Clan’s epoch peak warrior never recovered. The three-headed dog moved on as if it had done nothing more than flick its tail.

“Good grief, he’s gone…” All watched the massive form turn, their faces pale. Some low-ranking Ancient Clans nobles soiled themselves. An epoch peak warrior—once a godlike presence in the Nine Realms—now lay dead, his life snuffed out without even a chance to fight back.

“Too brutal! I surrender!” A voice cried out, and the man discarded his weapon, shouting at Star Moon Clan warriors.

At that moment, the black beast seemed more terrifying than Luo Tian himself.

“Xiaohei, you shouldn’t eat random things. Remember not to eat raw food—those brutes are filthy. What if you get sick?” Luo Tian stood atop the three-headed dog, addressing it.

“Grrr…” The beast nodded and lunged after Tu Changsheng again.

“Game over!” Tu Changsheng, fleeing, wore a bitter smile before suddenly turning to Luo Tian.

“I surrender. Do as you wish!” Facing the three-headed dog, Tu Changsheng had no will to fight. He stood motionless, a man of resolve.

“Grrr…” The three-headed dog ignored his pleas and lunged for Tu Changsheng, turning his face ashen.

“Xiaohei!” But just as the bloodstained maw closed in on Tu Changsheng, Luo Tian’s voice rang out.

“Told you not to eat dirty things. Why won’t you listen?” Luo Tian stepped down from the beast’s head and smacked it.

“Ugh…” The three-headed dog halted, emitting a whining sound of委屈. A wave of thought entered Luo Tian’s mind.

“Habit? This habit needs changing!” Luo Tian smiled at the beast.

“Damn it, can you at least keep your mouth shut while we talk!” Tu Changsheng’s face was pale, sweat pouring down his face. He felt an urge to cry as he stared at the three-headed dog’s maw, even seeing the dried blood of the Feather Clan warrior it had devoured.

One more snap and he would be dead. Tu Changsheng felt one foot already in the gates of death.

“Buzz…” As Tu Changsheng trembled, a golden seal flew from Luo Tian’s hand, instantly binding him. Luo Tian waved his hand, collecting Tu Changsheng and commanding: “Return!”

“Buzz…” But as the three-headed dog turned, a humming sound echoed from Luo Tian’s body. His face paled instantly.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s expression twisted violently, his body trembling as cold sweat streamed down his face.

Gray flames coiled around his soul, burning it relentlessly. The gray soul was completely engulfed in the fire.

“Why did I forget about this?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed with a bitter smile. The furious gray flames were the curse’s power.

Luo Tian had unleashed the curse’s wrath by killing a Qilin Clan warrior. It had remained dormant, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. And now it dragged forth the curse that had bound Luo Tian since his battle with Run Hongyu. This gray soul fire could annihilate even epoch peak warriors, or those whose souls were weak.

“Roar!” Luo Tian howled in pain, his soul battling the gray flames while adapting to the excruciating agony.

“Ugh…” The three-headed dog seemed to sense Luo Tian’s pain, halting and emitting a low whine. It carefully licked Luo Tian’s body.

“Fine…” Luo Tian smiled, addressing the beast. Though the soul fire was formidable, he had changed—now a power on par with an epoch master. Though his cultivation had dropped, his soul remained invincible.

“Get back!” Luo Tian roared, and his soul began to resist. The fire was pushed back.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian and the soul fire clashed in a different way. The three-headed dog carried him back to the crowd, its massive form radiating an invisible威慑.

The three-headed dog eyed the Ancient Clans with caution, even scanning Star Moon Clan warriors. It sensed Luo Tian’s poor condition and vowed to protect its master.

The Ancient Clans gazed at the beast’s fierce eyes and oppressive aura. They dared not breathe, feeling a chill coursing through their bodies. Even Star Moon Clan warriors felt uneasy under its gaze.

“Curse power!” The three men, restrained by Fu Xingyang, realized the cause of Luo Tian’s pain.

“Grrr…” The three-headed dog growled at them, sending an invisible wave into their battlefield.

“Damn it…” The wave slowed their movements.

“Die!” Fu Xingyang, who had long disliked the three men, seized the opportunity. A brilliant light struck the already wounded Huntianuo, finishing him off.

“Boom!” The man, already battered, could not withstand the blow. He was shattered into blood mist.

“Die!” Fu Xingyang’s face remained cold as he extended a hand. A starlight seal flew from his palm, instantly consuming the blood.

“Will you continue?” Fu Xingyang addressed the warriors of the蛮族 and the Phoenix Clan. Their relations with Star Moon Clan were good, but he had a grudge against them.

“No more. Do as you wish!” They exchanged glances, smiling bitterly. They hadn’t expected this outcome.

They had merely come to observe the situation. They knew their clans were on good terms with Star Moon Clan, but they had targeted Luo Tian specifically. They hoped to kill him while he was weakened and gain great merit in their own clans.

But they hadn’t expected Luo Tian, even with his cultivation dropped, to be beyond their reach. Three punches had killed a Qilin Clan warrior, and that three-headed black dog was an unstoppable force.

“Alright, capture these prisoners. Star Moon Continent has been destroyed again. They’ll become laborers!” Fu Xingyang addressed the Star Moon Clan warriors, then turned to Luo Tian. In a way, he had saved Star Moon Clan again.

“You can leave too!” Fu Xingyang then收回 the golden banner in the sky, addressing those who had retreated.

“Thank you, Divine Emperor!” The Ancient Clans were relieved. They feared Fu Xingyang’s wrath and the black dog’s power, which could kill them with a few breaths.

Chapter 1652: Alliance ()

In recent days, Star Moon Clan had faced many major events. The prince of the Ancient Clans, Fu Tu, had rebelled, causing heavy losses. Just as they were beginning to recover, several clan leaders had arrived with part of the Ancient Clans, demanding Star Moon Clan hand over the human race. But they had angered Star Moon Clan and a battle ensued.

People had expected Star Moon Clan to yield after their heavy losses, but instead they fiercely clashed with the clan leaders. The result was shocking—Star Moon Clan had killed half of the clan leaders and Ancient Clans warriors, with the rest captured.

But as this battle unfolded, everyone had noticed Luo Tian. The entire Ancient Clans of the Mortal Domain knew of his existence. Who could doubt that Star Moon Clan had suddenly produced such a powerful leader? And there was even a Provisional King-level pet.

Yet no one dared to provoke Luo Tian. The Mortal Domain was currently empty, and Star Moon Clan protected him. Plus, his strength was evident—just one dog could outmatch them all.

“Bitter! My clan’s great elders, hurry back!” The Ancient Clans felt bitter. They had a powerful enemy but couldn’t fight it, forced to watch it live freely.

“Buzz…” At this moment, Luo Tian wasn’t doing well either. He sat in a grand hall, the three-headed dog transformed into a small dog and lay before him. Its six eyes still held dangerous glances, scanning for any movement. If nothing was found, it would turn its gaze back to Luo Tian.

“Huff…” Seven days had passed. Luo Tian used seven days to subdue the fierce soul fire and adapt to its excruciating pain.

Now, a gray flame ran through his soul, burning it relentlessly. His soul constantly fought against it.

“Better than before!” Luo Tian’s face was pale, exhaling heavily. This incident had prevented him from recovering to the Provisional King level.

“Still need to find a way to break this curse. Otherwise, it will be a problem!” Luo Tian smiled bitterly. He felt that if he killed two more Ancient Clans epoch peak warriors, the curse would become even stronger.

At present, he had two of the three required sacred herbs for refining the Soul-Eating Pills: Longwu Ice and Pixin Flower. But he still needed three more extremely cold sacred herbs, which made finding them a challenge.

“Let me go out and ask my brother-in-law for news!” Luo Tian muttered, leading the three-headed dog out of the hall.

Seven days had passed. The Star Moon Clan’s continent was largely restored, except for things that couldn’t be built with epoch power. It looked almost the same as before.

Luo Tian walked along the road, people of Star Moon Clan watching him with complex expressions. Though he was human, he had helped Star Moon Clan through this crisis.

When people saw the seemingly harmless black dog before him, their faces turned envious. If they had such a pet, they could walk proudly everywhere—unless surrounded by several Provisional King-level masters.

Luo Tian didn’t care about what Star Moon Clan people thought. He led the three-headed dog into Fu Xingyang’s luxurious palace.

“How are you?” Seeing Luo Tian enter, Fu Xingyang asked immediately.

“Nothing major for now,” Luo Tian shook his head. Though pale, he wore a smile.

“This time I thank you. If not for your arrival, Star Moon Clan might have faced a great disaster!” Fu Xingyang’s face showed gratitude. Without Luo Tian, he would have been killed by Fu Tu and the others. Star Moon Clan would have lost at least half its people. Even if Fu Xueyue and others returned, without Grand Elder Fu Cangshan’s second life, they would have been in danger against the three ancient clan princes.

“How did you and Starxuan return?” Fu Xingyang smiled, looking at Luo Tian. He had guessed some from Luo Tian’s previous address but wanted to hear it himself.

“I called you my brother-in-law. What do you think I came for?” Luo Tian shook his head.

“Now you know my sister’s worth? What took you so long? I tell you, marrying my sister isn’t easy. You didn’t want her before, but now it’s not so simple!” Fu Xingyang sneered, looking at Luo Tian with disdain.

“Huff…” Hearing Fu Xingyang’s words, Luo Tian hadn’t even spoken yet. The three-headed dog stood before him, emitting low growls. Its silver eyes held a dangerous glint, making Fu Xingyang shiver.

Though Fu Xingyang had recovered his cultivation recently, he still felt a chill in the presence of the three-headed dog.

“Xiaohei, it’s our people!” Luo Tian gently patted the beast’s head, smiling.

“What conditions do you have? I’ll try my best!” Luo Tian shook his head. He knew Fu Xingyang had already agreed, but he felt a little annoyed about the past. If it were him, he might have made things harder for the other party.

“Wait until Star Moon and my father return,” Fu Xingyang said softly, then looked at Luo Tian. “But you can’t stay here too long. If it’s too long, the old ones who have lived second lives will come back and cause you trouble!”

“Hmph. I came to the Mortal Domain to settle our matters with Starxuan, to pay respects to my master!”

“Another purpose is to form an alliance with Star Moon Clan!” Luo Tian said softly, his expression serious.

“Alliance?” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Fu Xingyang’s brows furrowed. He wasn’t stupid; he could sense the meaning behind Luo Tian’s words.

“With you and Starxuan, we are already allies!” Fu Xingyang smiled, looking at Luo Tian.

“I mean something else. I want to form an alliance with the entire human race!” Luo Tian looked at Fu Xingyang, his expression solemn.

“Impossible. The grudges are too deep. They’ve lasted since ancient times and continue to this day. I can only promise no hostility toward you from the Four Sacred Realms. As for others, don’t expect me to agree. The elders won’t either!”

“Besides, our close relationship has already caused dissatisfaction among other clan leaders. The recent incident is an example. There’s no such thing as a secret that doesn’t leak. If we defect from the Ancient Clans, several clan leaders will surely unite to eliminate us!” Fu Xingyang shook his head and refused Luo Tian outright.

“Alright,” Luo Tian sighed. He knew this was a wishful dream.

“By the way, I need three sacred herbs. Do you know if Star Moon Clan has them?” Luo Tian asked softly, explaining the three herbs he was missing to Fu Xingyang.

“I don’t know if Star Moon Clan has them. I’m not interested in sacred herbs, and they’ve always been under my grandfather’s control. I don’t know much! I’ll check for you later. Hopefully, Star Moon Clan has them!” Fu Xingyang’s face turned serious upon hearing about Luo Tian’s curse.

“How is Starxuan doing?” Luo Tian asked next. Though he would check on her later, he still wanted to ask first.

“Her cultivation is slowly improving. You know, becoming a Provisional King isn’t without danger, but it’s difficult!” Fu Xingyang smiled. If Starxuan entered the Provisional King level, Star Moon Clan would fear no clan. Even ancient clan princes wouldn’t be taken seriously.

“Okay. I’ll go back now. I need to find a way to temporarily suppress this curse, otherwise it will take longer for me to recover my cultivation!” Luo Tian nodded and spoke a few more words with Fu Xingyang. Then he entered the void to check Starxuan’s condition, finding she was always on the verge of a breakthrough. He returned to Fu Xingyang’s prepared residence.

“Needle technique!” Back in his residence, Luo Tian thought for a while before his face lit up with excitement.

“Last time, Run Hongyu helped me suppress the curse using a needle technique. I understand it slightly; maybe I can do it myself!”

“But Run Hongyu said this method only works once. The second time, it fails. I need to study the previous needle technique first!” Luo Tian muttered and took out the needle bag Run Hongyu had given him.

“Buzz…” Then, Luo Tian waved his hand, and two figures fell to the ground.

Chapter 1653: Resentment ()

“Luo Tian!” The two figures were the fourth and fifth of the Phoenix Clan. Their cultivation was sealed, sitting there with cautious eyes toward Luo Tian.

“Don’t worry. I have no hostility toward you. I just want to ask for your help!” Luo Tian smiled, scanning the two.

“What do you want?” Seeing Luo Tian’s gaze, they instinctively shivered. A bad feeling arose.

“You’re from the Phoenix Clan. Do you have some special preference?” Jin Tianpeng’s eyes held fear, looking at Luo Tian’s gaze. It was the look of those with special preferences.

“F***!” Luo Tian slapped Jin Tianpeng’s face, anger rising. How could this bastard imagine him like that?

“Don’t worry. After I use you, when your clan comes, I’ll release you. After all, I’m a good youth who wants harmony among the Nine Realms and coexistence of all tribes!” Luo Tian smiled, taking out a silver needle.

“Used… used up!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, they were more certain he had some preference. They’d heard of变态 who liked to use needles.

“Luo Tian, have the guts and kill us. We’d rather die than suffer such humiliation!” Jin Tianpeng’s face was terrified, struggling but unable to move.

“F***! Shut up!” Luo Tian’s mouth twitched. He grabbed the silver needle and plunged it into Jin Tianpeng’s neck.

“Ah…” The next moment, a scream echoed through the hall. Jin Tianpeng’s veins bulged.

“Don’t move! You’ve messed it up!” Luo Tian frowned, seeing Jin Tianpeng still screaming.

“Why are you screaming? You won’t get your voice back today!” Luo Tian smiled and pulled out the needle.

“Alright, let’s start!” Luo Tian ignored their terrified gazes. His hands glowed silver as he repeatedly pierced the two’s vital points.

In the following days, screams of agony echoed through the hall. The sound was unbearable, leaving Star Moon Clan people confused outside.

“What is the commander doing?” Two Star Moon Guards stood at the hall’s entrance, whispering. Though some people in Star Moon Clan felt uncomfortable toward Luo Tian, the guards were an exception. In their hearts, he was their commander, and even Fu Xingyang couldn’t change that.

“Maybe he’s practicing something. Using the Phoenix Clan’s top talents for training—only the commander could do this!” They looked at him with reverence.

“Bring over the other three clans’ warriors!” As they whispered, Luo Tian’s voice echoed in their ears. Their bodies trembled slightly; it was the first time he had spoken in days.

“Yes!” They didn’t dare to delay, their figures flashing toward Fu Xingyang’s residence.

In the hall, Luo Tian’s eyes were bloodshot but his face held a smile. For days, he hadn’t rested, immersed in the needle technique. He had gained much and finally made Jin Tianpeng and the other stop screaming.

“Though it’s just a small step, it’s a big one for me!” Luo Tian smiled, looking at the two who lay half-dead.

Needle techniques were equally dangerous. These days, Jin Tianpeng and the other felt they had entered hell. Now, they fully understood Luo Tian’s intention: to slowly torture them to death.

These days had been dark for the two. The pain of the needles was nothing compared to the times when they felt fire burning their bodies or ice piercing them. Sometimes, even that aspect was stimulated by Luo Tian without release. After days of torment, they had lost three sizes, their cheekbones visible.

“Commander, I’ve brought five!” As the two glared at Luo Tian with hatred, two Star Moon Guards arrived with five Ancient Clans warriors under Fu Xingyang’s control. They looked at Luo Tian respectfully.

But when they saw the emaciated Phoenix Clan’s third and fourth, their confusion deepened.

“Luo Tian, what are you doing?” Among the five brought were three from the蛮族, Blood Clan, and Phoenix Clan.

“Third, fourth! What are you doing here!” The Phoenix Clan warrior saw Jin Tianpeng and looked puzzled.

“Uncle, we…” Jin Tianpeng weakly lay there, smiling bitterly. He hadn’t expected his uncle to be captured too.

“Alright, we’re all old acquaintances. I won’t be formal!” Luo Tian smiled and signaled the two Star Moon Guards to leave, addressing the five.

“What are you doing…?”

“Ah…” Another scream echoed through the hall, spreading throughout Star Moon City. All Star Moon Clan people were confused.

Time passed slowly. Three months had gone by, and Luo Tian seemed mad, working day and night. He also knew his needle technique was lacking, but he believed diligence could make up for it. If he practiced enough, he would surely succeed in creating a needle technique to suppress the curse.

While Luo Tian researched, Ancient Clans warriors were replaced repeatedly. Each who came to Luo Tian was thinner and more exhausted, trembling as Star Moon Guards took them away.

“Commander, truly a commander!” Two guards watching over the hall looked with admiration. Though they didn’t know what Luo Tian was doing, for so long he had never rested. They knew why he hadn’t rested because the screams in the hall never stopped.

“Damn it, I can’t take it anymore!” Star Moon Clan people had a hard time recently. Though they felt nothing at first, after long periods, people inevitably needed rest.

But Luo Tian never rested. The screams echoed constantly in Star Moon Clan, like noise. Imagine the pain of hearing a ghostly sound while trying to rest.

Star Moon Clan people finally rebelled, gathering at Fu Xingyang’s residence. “Divine Emperor, control him! We can’t endure it anymore. If this continues, the prisoners won’t be affected, but we’ll die from his games!” A crowd of Star Moon Clan people surrounded Fu Xingyang’s residence, their faces filled with resentment.

“Everyone, just hold on a little longer. Three months—after that, if he still doesn’t stop, I’ll personally make him stop!” Fu Xingyang’s face also looked weary. For half a year, he had been tormented by the screams but endured it for Luo Tian’s curse suppression. He also suppressed the chaos caused by Luo Tian.

“Not doing it anymore, I’m going on a mission! This continent is no longer livable!”

“Right, I’ll go into seclusion…” Star Moon Clan people looked angry and left.

At once, the mission hall of Star Moon Clan was packed. People rushed to take missions, especially those far away.

“Almost there… almost there…” In the hall, Luo Tian smiled madly, repeatedly piercing Ancient Clans warriors. His body had also thinned slightly. After half a year, his cultivation recovered to the Provisional King level. Through constant practice, he had finally developed a silver needle technique to suppress the curse.

“Now comes the test!” Luo Tian’s eyes glowed with excitement. Though he had created it, his grasp of the acupoints wasn’t precise enough.

“Diligence makes up for lack of talent. I won’t let this small silver needle defeat me!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth and tested it on more Ancient Clans warriors.

Three months passed. Star Moon Clan seemed emptier, with fewer people. It wasn’t that the remaining didn’t want to leave; it was just that Star Moon Clan needed people to stay and maintain normal operations. Plus, except for those extremely dangerous missions that almost guaranteed death, others were all taken by people, leaving no mission to take.

“Boom!” That day, Luo Tian was practicing as usual. The hall’s door was kicked open by Fu Xingyang.

“Kid, what are you doing?!” Fu Xingyang’s face was pale. After half a year without proper rest, he could barely endure it.

Behind Fu Xingyang were many Star Moon Clan people. Their eyes glowed green, like wolves, staring at Luo Tian with intense anger.

“Uh…” Luo Tian was stunned. He had made a mistake again, piercing a Phoenix Clan warrior’s neck with the silver needle. Another scream of agony echoed.

Hearing this scream, Fu Xingyang and Star Moon Clan people shivered. It felt like their ears were violated.

“H-hello… everyone…” Luo Tian’s face was awkward. He knew this look well—when he had offended Starxuan and been surrounded by Star Moon Clan people for execution, it was the same look.

“Why are you doing this? You’ve made Star Moon Clan lose two-thirds of its people in half a year! Are you trying to make us all run away?!” Fu Xingyang shouted, looking at Luo Tian.

“Uh…” Hearing Fu Xingyang’s words, Luo Tian was momentarily stunned. He didn’t know he had made Star Moon Clan look like this. His awkwardness deepened.

“Sorry, I didn’t mean to…” Luo Tian looked at Fu Xingyang and Star Moon Clan people with a guilty expression. He knew he had caused them trouble these days.

“Want to hit you, but I can’t!” Fu Xingyang glared at Luo Tian’s smile and wanted to strangle him.

“You bastard, I’ve never seen such a shameless person!” Star Moon Clan people looked at Luo Tian. A Provisional King-level master didn’t know their situation? No one would believe it.

“What did you do for half a year? Any progress?” Fu Xingyang noticed Luo Tian’s poor condition and looked interested, asking him.

“Some progress. I estimate it’ll take about half a year to suppress it!” Luo Tian’s face was pale and weak.

“Damn it, still showing off!” Seeing Luo Tian’s state, Fu Xingyang muttered in anger.

“Half a year… I can’t live like this!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Star Moon Clan people cursed.

“Not a day longer. If you keep doing this, I’ll be driven to rebellion!” Fu Xingyang’s mouth twitched. His handsome face turned angry, roaring at Luo Tian.

“Uncle-in-law… I’m really suffering. Three months is enough, right?” Luo Tian spoke with a negotiating tone, looking at Fu Xingyang.

“Three months isn’t enough. I said no days—no! This is the Ice Flower! We found it this half year. Stop now!” Fu Xingyang looked at Luo Tian with a headache, handing him a crystalline flower.

“Buzz…” As Fu Xingyang produced the crystalline flower, the hall filled with coldness. Ice mist spread from the transparent flower.

“Did you really find it?” Luo Tian’s eyes brightened. He didn’t hesitate, sealing the crystalline flower and storing it in his storage ring.

“Uncle-in-law… even one month is okay!” But Luo Tian still didn’t give up, trying to negotiate.

“Go away… this is non-negotiable!” Hearing Luo Tian still being shameless, Fu Xingyang cursed.

“Fifteen days?” Luo Tian asked carefully. If looks could kill, he might have been torn apart by Star Moon Clan people’s angry gazes.

“I said no. Also, don’t call me uncle-in-law. You haven’t married my sister yet. Why do you call me that?” Fu Xingyang sneered at Luo Tian.

“Uncle-in-law?” At this moment, Star Moon Clan people realized and turned to Luo Tian. They wanted to devour him alive.

“Monster! You’ve taken Starxuan Princess!” Star Moon Clan people cursed loudly.

“Hey, we’re all family. Don’t look at me so worshipfully. Just bless me!” Luo Tian smiled awkwardly.

“Damn it, I don’t want to live anymore. I’ll go into monastic life!”

“I’m so handsome, yet I haven’t competed with a human!” Star Moon Clan people cursed.

“Everyone, go back! Did I say Starxuan would marry him? Do what you need to do!” Fu Xingyang shouted.

“Also, be careful. I’m taking these tribes’ people with me!” Fu Xingyang nodded to Star Moon Clan people behind him, lifting the half-dead tribespeople.

“Disperse!” Fu Xingyang then waved his robe and led Star Moon Clan people out of the hall. Only Luo Tian remained.

“Sigh…” Luo Tian sighed, watching them leave with a smile. He gently patted the three-headed dog’s head: “Who are these people? Always jealous of me!”

“No test subjects left. What to do?” Luo Tian looked at the three-headed dog, making it uncomfortable. But he shook his head.

“Damn it, I’ll try myself! If no test subjects, I’ll use myself!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth and glared.

Thinking it through, he sat cross-legged to recover. His mind had been highly focused for these months.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian recovered his state while organizing the achievements of these half years.
