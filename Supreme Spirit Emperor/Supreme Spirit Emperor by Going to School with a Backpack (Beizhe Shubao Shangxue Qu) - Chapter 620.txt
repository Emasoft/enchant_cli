"Someone is definitely coming after us. If there aren't too many of them, I could fight back and buy some more time for Fu Xingyue!" Luotian muttered to himself, calculating the remaining time before his Demon-Subjugation Technique would collapse. His speed slowed slightly.

"Kid, where do you think you're going?" Just as Luotian's pace slowed, a furious voice echoed through the heavens and earth. A middle-aged man with a gloomy face rushed after him, his lips stained with blood - clearly having unleashed an extraordinary speed through some secret method.

Chapter 2339: Battle Against the Immortal King

"Fu Tiankui, Third Elder of Donghuang Mountain, an Immortal King at the initial stage. He's also Fu Beis father!" Luotian's mind instantly recalled the man's information.

"Only one of them?" Luotian's thoughts immediately sharpened. With nearly an hour left until the Demon-Subjugation Technique collapsed, if it was only Fu Tiankui, Luotian could still try to fight back.

"Old bastard, what are you? You think I'll stop just because you tell me to?" Luotian increased his speed, simultaneously unleashing his physical cultivation. He was now only a thousand zhang away from Fu Tiankui, preventing himself from being trapped in the latter's domain.

"You can't escape. I'll chase you until the end of time, even to hell - today I will kill you and peel your skin!" Fu Tiankui's heart slightly trembled. He had already pushed his speed to the limit, yet he couldn't catch up with this kid.

"Going to hell? Do you think I don't know that?" Luotian's heart coldly laughed. If he went to hell, a single word from him would kill Fu Tiankui.

"Old fool, don't think I don't know you have allies. That Immortal King at the middle stage - come out and fight me!" Luotian shouted, his voice filled with contempt. Though he knew the opponent was alone, he remained extremely cautious.

"Killing you doesn't need my second brother. I can do it alone!" Fu Tiankui loudly replied, his voice also filled with contempt.

"Really?" Just as Fu Tiankui's words finished, Luotian suddenly turned around. He activated the Yellow River Step, his body expanding to a thousand zhang in size as he slammed towards Fu Tiankui.

Luotian's sudden turn startled Fu Tiankui. He hadn't expected the opponent to actually dare to confront him.

The thunderous collision echoed through the heavens and earth. As Fu Tiankui was stunned, Luotian's massive body had already reached his vicinity, like a mountain crashing towards Fu Tiankui.

"Die!" Fu Tiankui coldly laughed, his domain instantly enveloping him. A formidable pressure radiated from Fu Tiankui as he met Luotian's charge.

"What? It's not affected by the domain!" Fu Tiankui's heart immediately chilled as he activated his domain.

"Crack..." The next moment, the collision echoed through the world. A deafening explosion rang out as Luotian's massive body retreated, while Fu Tiankui spat blood. His eyes showed disbelief as he gazed at Luotian.

"Kill..." Luotian steadied his body, the Long Yuan Sword appearing in his hand. The black sword radiated power as he took another step forward towards Fu Tiankui.

Fu Tiankui naturally wasn't afraid. He was an Immortal King, and his domain instantly revealed that Luotian had grasped a fragment of the domain's essence. Thus, he wasn't affected by Fu Tiankui's domain.

"Even without the domain, I can still kill you!" Fu Tiankui coldly laughed. His golden sword appeared in his hand, radiating an awe-inspiring aura as he clashed with Luotian.

Black and gold swords collided repeatedly. Their bodies continuously retreated, each clash causing the heavens to collapse and the world to tremble.

"Amazing strength!" Luotian spat blood. This was his first time facing an Immortal King at the initial stage, and he realized how terrifying they were. Within just a few tens of breaths, Luotian's body was already covered in cracks, and he had spat out countless blood.

While Luotian marveled at the strength, Fu Tiankui's heart was filled with waves of shock. Immortal Kings were favored by the heavens, and he had never heard of anyone with a half-step Immortal King's strength daring to challenge an Immortal King.

"His physical body is comparable to the initial stage of an Immortal King. What about his cultivation?"

"Human Emperor's Six Strikes - Shatter the Six Realms!" Fu Tiankui roared, his golden sword suddenly radiating power. A phantom emerged from behind Fu Tiankui, holding a golden sword image that slashed towards Luotian.

An incredible pressure radiated from the phantom, making Luotian's heart slightly tense. He immediately activated his Seven Steps of the Barbarian and charged towards the golden sword image.

The sword image flickered, cutting through space. A series of roaring sounds echoed as it severed the six realms.

"Boom..." In an instant, the sword image collided with Luotian's massive body. Luotian's colossal form was violently thrown back, causing mountains to collapse and winds to swirl.

"Although your cultivation is strong, it's not much more than that!" Fu Tiankui took two steps back with a cold smile. However, his heart was impressed - Luotian's cultivation had become very close to the initial stage of an Immortal King. But seeing the two black demonic patterns wandering on Luotian's body, Fu Tiankui knew that Luotian had used a secret technique.

"Buzz..." As he spoke, Fu Tiankui's second sword slashed out. The phantom also raised its hand, gathering a powerful aura.

"Barbarian God's Sixth Step - Shake the Heavens!" Luotian roared. Using his sixth step of the Seven Steps of the Barbarian, this time he wasn't as haphazard as before. His strength had improved significantly.

"Boom..." The thunderous sound of the collision filled the sky. Six leg images clashed with a world-destroying sword aura. Luotian's divine body was violently shattered, and the phantom in front of Fu Tiankui also collapsed. Fu Tiankui spat blood, his eyes filled with intense shock.

The storm swept through the ruins, enveloping both of them. When the storm calmed down, Luotian slowly stood up, gazing at Fu Tiankui who had also risen with severe injuries. He wiped the blood from his face, revealing two eyes filled with madness that made Fu Tiankui's heart slightly tremble.

"Kill..." Luotian took a step forward, charging towards Fu Tiankui. He was certain that Fu Tiankui's condition was slightly better than his, but not by much. In a narrow encounter, only those who dared to fight for their lives could survive.

"Buzz..." Five fist images merged. One punch aimed at Fu Tiankui. Fu Tiankui's face slightly changed, raising his fist to meet the attack. The two of them fell into another fierce battle.

A series of fist images rose in front of both of them. The physical combat gave Luotian a chance to recover his cultivation quickly.

"This isn't working. I won't be able to kill him, but he might be able to kill me!" Luotian muttered to himself. At the moment, they seemed evenly matched, but Luotian knew he still had a significant disadvantage.

His recovery speed was slower than Fu Tiankui's. As an Immortal King, Fu Tiankui could recover using the power of the world, which would definitely be faster than Luotian's.

"Kid, I can even starve you to death!" Fu Tiankui's face was filled with mockery. Luotian had misunderstood - Immortal Kings could use the power of the world, almost endless. If it hadn't been for Luotian's attack, Fu Tiankui could have continued to destroy him with martial arts.

"I've decided to end this quickly!" Fu Tiankui coldly laughed, colliding with Luotian. His body flew back, and his hands quickly moved, summoning a series of runes from his hands.

"Human Emperor's Transformation!" Fu Tiankui roared. Golden runes flowed over his body, enhancing him.

Luotian moved swiftly, following closely behind and continuously throwing punches. However, he saw the mockery in Fu Tiankui's eyes as golden light filled his fists and he launched a punch.

"Crack..." A brittle sound rang out. Luotian's body flew back, his eyes filled with disbelief. His entire right arm began to seep blood.

One strike had wounded him, making him feel like a commoner hitting a stone. His entire right arm was numb.

"Souls like blades!" Luotian's eyes showed cruelty. He knew he no longer had an advantage in his physical body, so he had to find another way - the soul.

A gray soul blade appeared above Luotian's head, controlled by him as it slashed towards Fu Tiankui. Meanwhile, Fu Tiankui also moved swiftly, appearing in front of Luotian and swiping his hand towards Luotian's head.

"Smack..." Luotian threw a punch, but it had no effect. His entire body was violently thrown back by Fu Tiankui's golden hand, and the soul blade he had summoned also slashed onto Fu Tiankui's head.

"Ah..." Fu Tiankui immediately cried out in pain. Luotian's body also fell to the ground, spitting blood profusely.

"I can't take much more!" Luotian muttered to himself, considering retreating. He realized the gap between him and an Immortal King at the initial stage. He could walk through anyone below an Immortal King, but against someone like Fu Tiankui at the initial stage, he had to fight for his life - and even then, it wasn't guaranteed.

Earlier, Luotian had completely exchanged injuries, fighting for his life and severely wounding Fu Tiankui's soul. Immortal Kings were favored by the heavens, their physical bodies and cultivation vastly surpassing those below them. However, there were still weaknesses - the soul was a flaw for Immortal Kings. Luotian had accidentally guessed correctly.

Although an Immortal King's soul was stronger than a normal person's, it was still weaker than Luotian's abnormal soul.

"Who are you with the Tianhun Mountain?" Fu Tiankui trembled as he stood up, gazing at Luotian. In the entire immortal world, few people could attack with a soul. Only those from Tianhun Mountain could wound an Immortal King's soul.

"What business is that of yours?" Luotian's face showed contempt, his expression also grim. A gray soul blade reappeared as he summoned it again while calculating the time - the Demon-Subjugation Technique's dissolution was almost complete, and he would be taken by the补天石.

"Kid, I'm not playing anymore. Here's a big one!" Luotian spoke again, the soul blade凝聚 seven-tenths of his soul power as it slashed towards Fu Tiankui.

"Die..." Fu Tiankui looked at the powerful soul blade, his face changing. The previous strike had already hurt him; this soul blade would definitely kill or severely wound him, maybe even destroy his soul.

Chapter 2340: The Ambush from the Eternity Mountain

"Breath..." A fluctuation spread as Luotian appeared on the补天石, panting heavily while continuously placing pills into his mouth. At the same time, the soul blade that had taken seven-tenths of Luotian's soul power also slashed onto Fu Tiankui.

"Open!" Fu Tiankui roared, his hands summoning a gray soul sword. After all, soul attacks couldn't be blocked by ordinary means.

However, the soul sword Fu Tiankui had凝聚 was obviously inferior to Luotian's soul blade. After the collision, the gray soul sword directly shattered, and the long gray blade pierced into Fu Tiankui's body.

"Ah..." Fu Tiankui cried out again, his soul pain ten times stronger than physical pain. He grabbed his head with both hands, rolling on the ground, and large areas of the ground were shattered by him.

"Go... I think he won't get up for a while!" Luotian's face was also pale. Seven-tenths of his soul power had drained him greatly, and he now felt dizzy and exhausted. If he continued fighting with Fu Tiankui, he wouldn't be in good shape either.

However, Luotian now had a sense of where his gap with an Immortal King at the initial stage was. He could fight, but the chances of victory were slim.

The补天石 floated gently towards the Huantian Sea. After a while, Fu Tiankui finally stood up, his eyes filled with coldness.

"This kid must not be left alive!" Fu Tiankui muttered to himself. After fighting with Luotian, he had realized how terrifying he was. A half-step Immortal King had wounded him - this talent would be a big problem for Donghuang Mountain when he grew up, even if he reached the initial stage of an Immortal King.

"Earlier, he vanished into thin air and flew south. Where was he going?" Fu Tiankui became puzzled, taking out the Donghuang Mountain's token to send a message. He knew that by himself he couldn't take down Luotian.

"No matter who you are, as long as you're in the immortal world, there's no place for you to hide!" Fu Tiankui coldly laughed and flew towards the Jiutian City.

As Fu Tiankui returned, the entire Jiutian City began to stir. Killing Donghuang Mountain's genius Fu Bei, killing fifty or sixty disciples from the Nine Immortal Mountains outside Jiutian City, and Fu Tiankui returning wounded - each event was a major incident that could cause people to talk about it. This matter even reached the Nine Immortal Mountains, but their attitudes were different. The Ghost King Sect and Medicine King Mountain remained silent, while Donghuang Mountain was furious. Fu Han personally descended from the mountain to head back to Jiutian City.

What was more strange was that until now, no one knew who this person was. Even Zhou Zhiwen remained silent about the person who had done these things.

However, people still suspected Luotian. After all, only a few people had entered the Huamoli Ling with Fu Bei - Gu Qianxue, Hun Xuan, and Yin Xiu had already returned to their sects. Only Luotian's whereabouts were unknown.

The补天石 flew for three hours, and Luotian had recovered enough. The Demon-Subjugation Technique's state was already dissolved, and he appeared in the sky, flying towards the Huantian Sea. Time passed, Luotian flew for another hour and finally appeared at the edge of the Huantian Sea. Vast and endless, a silver warship floated there, with several figures standing on it. Fu Xingyue's eyes were filled with worry as she gazed at the Huantian Coast.

"Buzz..." A sound of breaking through the air rang out as Luotian's figure appeared in front of the ship, making Fu Xingyue's eyes show a hint of joy.

"Go quickly!" Luotian didn't hesitate. Although it seemed safe now, who knew what dangers there were? They had just started.

Luotian landed on the ship. Someone quickly activated the ship, rushing into the Huantian Sea and leaving a trail of water before disappearing from the spot.

"Breath..." The ship started, and Luotian let out a long breath. At least, things seemed to be going smoothly so far.

"Three months, in three months we can enter the Middle Heaven!" Luotian spoke to Fu Xingyue.

"Three months? That's so boring, isn't it?" Fu Xingyue sighed with helplessness. Just entering the immortal world and being chased like a lost dog wasn't a happy thing.

"The Huantian Sea has many fierce beasts, apparently in some agreement with the Nine Immortal Mountains. However, we still need to be careful. The Huantian Sea is vast and also has unknown dangers!" Luotian warned, sitting cross-legged at the bow to rest.

Time passed. The ship's speed was extremely fast, and they could no longer see the Huantian Coast. Around them was only an endless sea.

"Buzz..." Just as Luotian's heart had just relaxed, a series of breaking through the air sounds rose from afar, making Luotian's face become serious.

"Another one is coming after us?" Luotian wondered, watching the Huantian Sea's waves rise.

Light flickered. Seven figures appeared in front of the ship, their auras powerful and eyes cold as if they could freeze the Huantian Sea.

"Damn!" Luotian's face darkened. Seeing the clothes they wore, he recognized these people came from Eternity Mountain.

"Luotian!" The leader of the group shouted, his domain enveloping them. Instantly, the entire ship stopped and hovered on the surface of the Huantian Sea.

"Killing my son, you still want to run?" A middle-aged man radiated a furious aura. He was the eldest disciple of Eternity Immortal King, Nie Yuntian.

Previously, Nie Yuntian had been investigating who killed Nie Sheng. Although the Central Heaven Market was under the control of the Nine Immortal Mountains, it could still keep a secret. Until Luotian and others returned, people focused on the incident of Fu Bei's death, so many had forgotten that Luotian had previously killed Nie Sheng.

Others had forgotten, but those who were sealed by the Central Heaven Market hadn't. They immediately spread the news to Eternity Mountain.

Nie Yuntian had already found some clues. Nie Sheng's last known location was Jiutian City, so he rushed to Jiutian City and caught up with Luotian's group.

"Who else have you killed?" Fu Xingyue's lips twitched as he transmitted a thought to Luotian. How did it feel like leaving the Star Domain was a very wrong decision?

"Just two..." Luotian felt embarrassed, responding to Fu Xingyue. However, he was constantly thinking about how to get through this crisis.

Fighting directly would definitely be impossible. After all, the opponent wasn't someone easy to deal with. Nie Yuntian was an Immortal King at the initial stage, and he had four half-step Immortal Kings behind him, two True Immortals at the peak. Moreover, Luotian felt Nie Yuntian's aura was much more solid than the one he had just fought against Fu Tiankui, obviously having been in the initial stage of an Immortal King for many years.

"Kill them all, no survivors!" Nie Yuntian coldly ordered. They only had six people, but they could easily eliminate Luotian and his group.

"Can you fight four of them?" Luotian turned around, looking at Fu Xingyue. His words made Fu Xingyue tremble.

"Think everyone is as abnormal as you? Three, no more than three!" Fu Xingyue cursed. Obviously, he couldn't fight four of them.

"It's enough!" Luotian waved his hands, releasing Dahei and Erhei. The two had made significant progress in the Huamoli Ling and could now match a half-step Immortal King.

"Let them go first!" As he spoke, Luotian pressed his hands together and activated the Tianren Dao Method to enhance the ship.

"Buzz..." The ship transformed into a streak of light, breaking free from the domain's range and flying towards the depths of the Huantian Sea.

"Want to run? None of you can escape!" Nie Yuntian coldly laughed, his Immortal King aura spreading as he took a step forward towards Luotian and others. One step, and he instantly appeared in front of Luotian's two.

"Go back!" Luotian roared, throwing a punch towards Nie Yuntian's direction.

"Naive!" Nie Yuntian scoffed, throwing a punch as well. The two punches collided.

"Boom..." Luotian's body was violently thrown back, spitting blood. His body crashed into the Huantian Sea, creating a large wave.

"Roar..." At the same time, Dahei and Erhei returned to their true forms. Following Luotian's orders, they charged towards a half-step Immortal King with a roar.

"Damn it, I'll fight!" Fu Xingyue roared, blocking three half-step Immortal Kings. However, he was immediately smashed by their combined attack. Obviously, one person fighting three was too much for him.

"Although you have some skills, you're still an ant!" Nie Yuntian saw Luotian emerging from the Huantian Sea. His eyes flashed with surprise, but it was fleeting. He pressed his finger out.

The thunderous sound of the world's collapse, the entire world seemed to be reduced to just this single finger.

"Think you can kill me?" Luotian's eyes showed cruelty. He knew this was the time to fight for his life. If he didn't fight, he would be completely dead.

The sky was torn apart as black ghost claws appeared and grabbed towards that finger. A massive body wrapped in black scales emerged halfway, even able to sense the cold eyes outside the sky.

Boom... Boom...

The thunderous sound echoed, but the black demonic claws were directly crushed by that powerful finger. The finger continued to press down on Luotian.

Luotian's face was grim. He had just finished using the Demon-Subjugation Technique and hadn't been for long. If he used it again, the effect wouldn't be much, and it would strongly damage his body. After all, in this period, Luotian had used the Demon-Subjugation Technique too many times.

"Boom..." Luotian threw a punch, which was震退 by the finger that had been weakened by the ghost claws.

"Buzz..." As Luotian just steadied his body, Nie Yuntian instantly appeared in front of him. He pressed his hand towards Luotian.

The sword flew out of the red sheath, appearing in Luotian's hand. He slashed towards Nie Yuntian's hand. However, it still couldn't change the outcome. Luotian was thrown back, and his sword almost slipped from his hand. Nie Yuntian's hand also had a blood mark.

Chapter 2341: Sinking the Ship

"Many methods, but in front of absolute strength, they're still useless!" Nie Yuntian's face was calm as he looked at Luotian, always treating him like an ant. He took another step forward towards Luotian.

"Boom..." As Nie Yuntian walked toward Luotian, an invisible aura again enveloped Luotian like a mountain.

"Damn it, what should I do? Do I have to use the Epoch Book?" Luotian muttered in his heart. He could only think of his last secret weapon, the Epoch Book that hadn't been used for a long time.

"Buzz..." The next moment, a large green hand suddenly凝聚 and pressed down on Luotian.

Luotian's face was grim. Even with the Demon-Subjugation Technique, he had only fought evenly against Fu Tiankui. Finally, Luotian escaped. Now without the Demon-Subjugation Technique, he was brutally beaten by Nie Yuntian.

The sword cut through the air. It collided with the green hand, and Luotian's blood poured out like money.

"His physical body is quite good!" Nie Yuntian coldly laughed, watching the cracks on Luotian's body. He continuously attacked, making Luotian suffer.

But Luotian was also suffering. Fu Xingyue's situation wasn't much better, being surrounded by three half-step Immortal Kings. His body was quickly covered with wounds.

"Luotian, I can't take it much longer..." Fu Xingyue shouted. Before he could finish speaking, he took the opportunity to be thrown back and looked at Luotian's situation. His heart felt a twinge.

Wretchedness was the most fitting description for Luotian's situation these days. First, it was the怨婴, then Fu Tiankui, and finally Nie Yuntian. All were Immortal Kings. That Luotian had survived three of their hands was already a miracle.

"Figure it out yourself. If you can't fight, run!" Luotian shouted. He really wanted to run, but the ship had just left. Even if he escaped with the补天石, Nie Yuntian and others could definitely catch up with the ship.

Time passed. Luotian continuously fought, using various martial arts and even his Seven Steps of the Barbarian. However, Nie Yuntian showed no signs of panic, continuously breaking Luotian's techniques like a cat playing with a mouse before eating it.

Fu Xingyue's situation wasn't much better. At first, Fu Xingyue fought three alone and fell behind. Finally, Luotian couldn't bear to watch anymore and had the three dogs split up to help Fu Xingyue.

However, this division completely left these two and the three dogs without any advantage. Fu Xingyue could originally fight two alone, but he had been injured too much before and had almost died several times.

Around them, the seawater within tens of thousands of miles violently churned as if a tsunami had occurred. Even the water level on the coast began to fluctuate up and down.

"Damn it, I'll fight you!" Luotian finally couldn't hold back. He roared, his breaths coming in heavy gasps. The Mo Ming Sword appeared in his hand, and the demonic energy within his body rushed into the sword. A sharp aura radiated from Luotian's Mo Ming Sword.

"What is this?" Nie Yuntian looked at Luotian's suddenly expanded aura, his eyes showing a hint of surprise. He felt this aura was strangely familiar.

Luotian waved his hand, instantly sending Fu Xingyue and the three dogs to the补天石. Obviously, Luotian was now giving up on saving himself, at least letting Fu Xingyue and the three dogs live.

One Sword to Heaven! Luotian's intention was indeed One Sword to Heaven. He knew that once he used it, there would be no way back. The Tiandao Sect was destroyed by Eternity Mountain. Nie Yuntian was an elder disciple of Eternity Immortal King, so he definitely knew this sword technique.

A terrifying power gathered, shaking the heavens and even causing Nie Yuntian's domain to tremble. The four half-step Immortal Kings accompanying Nie Yuntian looked at Luotian's expanding Mo Ming Sword, their bodies instinctively trembling. They felt a destructive power that could crush them in Luotian's hand.

"Kid, it's been such a short time. Your brain has become dull?" Just as Luotian was preparing to use One Sword to Heaven, a playful voice rang out in the sky. The azure sky was torn apart, and several figures appeared from above.

Dressed in white, with a long sword on his back. The most eye-catching was the gourd of wine at his waist. His entire appearance seemed ethereal, and behind him stood several figures in blood-red robes, radiating a killing aura. These were Zhang Ziping, Lei Yong, Ji Chen, and Tianfu.

"Jiang Taibai!" As these people appeared, Nie Yuntian's face immediately changed. He waved his hands, and a green door exploded with thunderous power towards Luotian's direction. This was the same Eternity Door that Nie Sheng had used before.

However, this time it was Nie Yuntian who activated it. The power was overwhelming, as if truly a gateway to eternal life. A terrifying pressure spread, making Luotian's face even paler.

"Saved!" As soon as Luotian saw Jiang Taibai, his eyes showed wild joy. However, the thunderous Eternity Door that descended made his heart tighten.

"Die!" Nie Yuntian pressed his hands down on Luotian. The green door instantly descended upon Luotian's head, about to crush him.

Nie Yuntian also knew that Luotian was a senior of the Btian Sect. Jiang Taibai's arrival definitely wasn't good news. If Jiang Taibai fought, he wouldn't have a chance to kill Luotian.

"Block it! If I can block it, I'll live!" Luotian roared. He looked at the descending immortal door with endless madness. At this moment, only himself could save him. Even if Jiang Taibai fought, he wouldn't be able to arrive in time.

"Manifesting the World!" Luotian roared. His massive body suddenly expanded, his hands lifting the sky and resisting the green door.

"Boom..." A dull sound rang out on Luotian's back. His divine body was violently shattered, and his body directly fell into the Huantian Sea.

"Damn it..." Jiang Taibai's face finally changed. His companions' faces also changed, and they flew up towards the direction where Luotian fell into the Huantian Sea.

"Block them! I've already used one of my Eternity Doors. Even if he doesn't die, he'll lose a layer of skin and be trapped in the depths of the Huantian Sea. He won't have the strength to come out!" Nie Yuntian shouted, flying up and blocking Jiang Taibai's path.

"Get out of my way..." Lightning flashed, Lei Yong's eyes showed madness. He struck the half-step Immortal King who blocked him.

"Crack..." Cold air spread, freezing three thousand zhang. The entire Huantian Sea was frozen. Zhang Ziping's face was grim.

"No..." Zhang Ziping instantly withdrew the freezing power, and the Huantian Sea returned to churning. He had frozen several thousand zhang, but he hadn't found Luotian in the frozen area.

"Deeper!" Zhang Ziping didn't hesitate and rushed into the Huantian Sea. At this moment, he thought finding people was more important than killing.

However, as soon as Zhang Ziping entered the water, a beam of light slashed towards him. He had to respond.

At the same time, Tianfu, Ji Chen, and Lei Yong fought against the half-step Immortal Kings from Eternity Mountain.

"Nie Yuntian, let me go save him. Otherwise, it's not over!" Jiang Taibai also continuously fought, his long sword constantly emitting power as he slashed towards Nie Yuntian.

"Think you're so lucky. Killing my son, you have to pay the price!"

"I've heard of Jiang Taibai's name before. I haven't had a fight with him yet, which is my biggest regret. Today I'll see what abilities the wine sword saint has!" Nie Yuntian scoffed, showing no respect for Jiang Taibai at all.

"Junior!" Jiang Taibai's eyes showed coldness. A sword beam cut through space, radiating supreme power. Nie Yuntian's face immediately changed.

Experts can tell by their first move. Although both were at the initial stage of an Immortal King, Nie Yuntian was a genius who had entered the Immortal King stage earlier than Jiang Taibai. However, Jiang Taibai's sword strike brought a strong sense of crisis to Nie Yuntian, forcing him to fully concentrate on it.

"Boom..." The Eternity Door was summoned again. It collided with the sword beam, spreading a violent aura in all directions.

"Pu..." Nie Yuntian spat blood. His eyes showed disbelief as he saw Jiang Taibai rushing towards him again.

"Ah..." Just as Jiang Taibai moved, a scream rang out. The half-step Immortal King who had fought against Zhang Ziping was frozen by him and then turned into blood-colored ice, falling into the Huantian Sea and melting into blood water floating in it.

"Fast!" Nie Yuntian's eyes slightly narrowed. He hadn't expected Jiang Taibai's people to be so strong. In one move, they had killed a half-step Immortal King.

Zhang Ziping's face was pale. Obviously, that strike had greatly drained him. However, he didn't care and flew up, diving into the Huantian Sea to search for Luotian's whereabouts.

"Go..." Nie Yuntian shouted, his heart had a desire to retreat. He knew that Luotian hadn't surfaced yet and was definitely in trouble. He knew the depths of the Huantian Sea had many currents.

Zhang Ziping instantly descended ten thousand zhang, seeing strange fish in the sea water. However, he hadn't found Luotian's figure yet. His eyes were red.

Ten thousand zhang... twenty thousand zhang... Zhang Ziping continued to descend, but he still hadn't found Luotian's figure. Until his chest was pressed down and even slightly caved in, he continued to search deeper for Luotian's figure.

"Go!" As Zhang Ziping continued to descend, Jiang Taibai appeared beside him. He grabbed Zhang Ziping and rushed out of the Huantian Sea.

"Cough... cough..." Zhang Ziping coughed up blood. His eyes showed sorrow. Lei Yong and Ji Chen's eyes were also sad.

The four brothers, who had walked together, were like close brothers. Now seeing Luotian fall into the Huantian Sea and not being alive, and it was all witnessed by them. Guilt was inevitable.

Chapter 2342: Mermaid

Nie Yuntian was definitely a strong person. He wanted to leave, and Jiang Taibai couldn't stop him. The opponents of Lei Yong and Ji Chen also fled, leaving Zhang Ziping and others with sad expressions standing on the surface of the Huantian Sea.

"Good people have fate. This kid definitely has a strong life force; maybe he's still alive!" Jiang Taibai spoke softly. Although that was what he said, he also knew Luotian was probably dead. The Huantian Sea was extremely dangerous. Even if he was severely injured, maybe there was no way out.

"Little Tian, you won't die!" Zhang Ziping spoke softly. His voice was unusually firm. His eyes flashed with killing intent, but he didn't act recklessly. He flew towards Jiutian City.

...The Huantian Sea stretched across the entire immortal world. No one knew how big it was, where it came from, or where it flowed to. Even the Nine Immortal Kings hadn't stepped out of the Huantian Sea's range.

However, there was a faction within the Huantian Sea. Its strength was no less than one of the Nine Immortal Mountains, and even surpassed them - the Sea Monster Clan.

Called sea monsters, it was a general term given by the immortal world to the tribes in the Huantian Sea. In fact, the Sea Monster Clan included countless races, with species even surpassing those of hell's ghosts.

At the bottom of the Huantian Sea, a figure had its eyes closed. It looked like a corpse, perhaps because it had been in the water for too long and its body had become fat. Its wounds were slowly healing, even some rotting. This body was Luotian.

"Luotian, wake up!" The补天石 continuously called out to Luotian. Now only the补天 stone could communicate with him.

An Immortal King at the initial stage's full power strike could kill any half-step Immortal King. Especially Nie Yuntian, who was a genius at the initial stage of an Immortal King.

Luotian's physical body was abnormal, but it wasn't that strong. That Eternity Door had almost killed Luotian. It directly pressed him into the depths of the Huantian Sea, and he was drifting with the currents.

"Ugh..." Luotian slowly woke up. However, intense pain made him almost pass out again.

"补天石!" Luotian checked his body. His heart was bitter. At this moment, his entire body felt like it wasn't his own at all; he couldn't control it.

"You finally woke up. If you didn't wake up, something would have happened!" The补天 stone's voice was relieved in Luotian's mind.

"But now you're still dead..." The补天 stone communicated with Luotian, feeling his weakness.

"Move me onto you!" Luotian felt uncomfortable. If he continued like this, any sea monster could kill him.

"Can't do it. Your body is too weak. It can't withstand the effort. If you move to me, it might break your meridians!" The补天 stone replied. It had been preventing Luotian from inhaling the Huantian Sea water.

"Then let Fu Xingyue come down and give me some pills. I don't even have the strength to activate my storage ring!" Luotian replied again. He hadn't been injured this severely for a long time.

"Buzz..." As Luotian finished speaking, Fu Xingyue's battered body appeared in front of him. His condition wasn't much better than Luotian's.

"Luotian, how are you? You can't die!" Fu Xingyue immediately appeared and didn't care about the strong water pressure around him. He rushed towards Luotian.

His condition was no better than Luotian's. Previously, he had rested on the补天 stone and watched Luotian in the sea water. He could only watch helplessly, as he didn't know how deep it was in the Huantian Sea. The strong pressure might have crushed him to death at that time.

"Don't move him, the more you move him, the faster he'll die!"

"Medicine pills. Give him some to recover his injuries!" As Fu Xingyue rushed in, the补天 stone immediately stopped him and made Fu Xingyue stay still.
