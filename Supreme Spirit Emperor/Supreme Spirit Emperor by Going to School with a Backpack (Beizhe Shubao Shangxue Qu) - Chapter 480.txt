"Truly seeking death! This Thunder Cage is forged from lightning stones. Every time our sect's disciples undergo the Heavenly Tempest, they can absorb one-tenth of its power. Though small, it reaches terrifying levels. He's clearly seeking his own demise!" The members of the Chaos Heaven Sect sneered, watching Luo Tian wrapped in lightning.

"Open!" Luo Tian's consciousness grew numb. Smoke curled from his body, yet his eyes remained resolute. He knew this was his best chance. Though he didn't understand Hong Haosheng's intentions, even if it was a death trap, Luo Tian would still break through.

"Ah..." Luo Tian roared repeatedly. His golden elixir in the dantian spun rapidly, channeling surging spiritual energy through his body to counter the thunderous force.

"Crack..." As if space had shattered, the two iron rods of the cage suddenly snapped. The massive prison collapsed instantly.

Like an apocalypse, lightning surged in all directions, instantly enveloping Luo Tian and his companions.

"He actually shattered the thunder cage!" People's faces showed shock. They gazed at Luo Tian bathed in lightning. With the cage broken, the thunder dispersed, lessening its threat toward Luo Tian.

"Come!" Luo Tian's face softened. He gazed at Long Jie, his Nihilation Dragon Seal radiating waves that enveloped Long Jie. Long Jie's figure vanished from sight.

"Truly captured!" Everyone's faces showed shock. None expected the dragon, which even the Chaos Heaven Sect couldn't subdue, to be tamed by Luo Tian.

"Thank you, elder!" Luo Tian bowed respectfully to Hong Haosheng. This was genuine gratitude. Though he knew Hong Haosheng had ill intentions, at least it saved Long Jie.

The Chaos Heaven Sect members' faces darkened as if they'd eaten excrement. That was a dragon king - coveted even by the middle three realms' great sects.

"Haha, truly a prodigy!" Hong Haosheng laughed heartily. Unlike others' expressions, even Luo Tian saw joy in Hong Haosheng's eyes - though fleeting, it didn't escape Luo Tian's gaze.

Luo Tian said nothing. He secretly connected the Dragon Eye Crystal with the Nihilation Dragon Seal, knowing Long Jie needed its vast pure spiritual energy to recover.

"Good. This is fate!" Hong Haosheng chuckled, then turned his gaze toward Duan Chengfeng.

"Duan Senior, since today is so joyous, would you stay a while longer?" Hong Haosheng spoke, trying to retain Duan Chengfeng.

"Haha, since the sect leader has extended such kindness, I shall comply!" Duan Chengfeng laughed. He wanted to find an opportunity to incite the Chaos Heaven Sect against Luo Tian. If he left now, they'd surely fight on the way. Now Duan Chengfeng felt fear toward Luo Tian, though he wasn't afraid of him, he still didn't want conflict.

"Duan Senior, the sect's affairs are paramount. If you wish to stay longer, let me handle the mission," Luo Tian said solemnly.

"Posturing..." Duan Chengfeng knew immediately Luo Tian was posturing. He wasn't foolish enough to miss Hong Haosheng's apparent tolerance, but pigs are fattened before being slaughtered.

Luo Tian was now a pig in Hong Haosheng's eyes, to be fed before being led to the slaughter.

"Don't waste this night. Tomorrow I'll personally deliver the ascension candidates to you!" Hong Haosheng's face darkened, addressing Luo Tian and Duan Chengfeng.

"Good! Since the sect leader insists on retaining us, we dare not disobey!" Luo Tian nodded. His sense of crisis grew stronger, but he saw the threat in Hong Haosheng's eyes. If he insisted on leaving, Hong Haosheng would tear down the mask.

"If we tear it down, summoning true immortal elders would be more troublesome. Let's see what tricks he has up his sleeve - one step at a time!" Luo Tian thought.

"Come, let's return. I'll have a heart-to-heart chat with Duan Senior!" Hong Haosheng smiled again, addressing everyone.

"Luo Tian!" As they walked down the mountain, a group approached. Their voices echoed in the silent night.

"Trouble comes one after another!" Luo Tian thought, gazing at the approaching figures.

A round fat man walked toward them - Yao Qishui, who had left the gambling stone shop before. But this time he lacked his former arrogance, standing as a subordinate.

Chapter 1855: The Beginning

"Senior Brother, it's this kid. He tried to kill me and took my two king stones!" Yao Qishui shouted toward the leading youth. They reached Luo Tian and Hong Haosheng.

Luo Tian now clearly saw the leader's face - cold, radiating a killing aura. To his left stood Yao Qishui, whose face was red with wounds from losing the king stones. His grandfather had punished him severely, leaving him limping.

To his right stood a light-hearted youth. His eyes surveyed Luo Tian. Behind them, several young disciples glared at Luo Tian with hostile auras.

"Fan Yongning, what brings you here?" Hong Haosheng's eyes showed slight surprise before addressing the youth.

"Ah, Fan Yongning!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He had previously researched all the prodigies from the lower three realms' sects, and Fan Yongning was one of them.

"Greetings, Sect Leader. Nothing serious - just settling personal matters!" Fan Yongning bowed slightly to Hong Haosheng, but everyone could see his lack of respect.

"Personal matters? Who do you have personal issues with? Is it the Tianmen Sect's prodigy?" Hong Haosheng's gaze deepened, then turned to Luo Tian.

"Exactly. This Luo Tian tried to kill my brother and stole his belongings. As an elder, I must retrieve them!" Fan Yongning spoke softly.

"Among the Chaos Heaven Sect's three Grand Elders, Yao Qishui's grandfather is one. Fan Yongning's grandfather is another. The youth on his right, Mei Youbing, also has one of the three Grand Elders as his grandfather," Long Jie's weak voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Three Grand Elders, close allies. Their grandsons are also good friends!" Long Jie added, then fell silent again. He knew Luo Tian's experience would let him infer the rest.

"Ah, I see!" Luo Tian's thoughts raced. Especially with Fan Yongning's expression, he guessed some things.

Luo Tian said nothing, gazing at Hong Haosheng. If Fan Yongning's three Grand Elders appeared, he might be cautious. But these three, he didn't take them seriously.

"Haha, since it's personal matters, let the two of you settle it. But be careful not to hurt each other!" Before Hong Haosheng could speak, Duan Chengfeng laughed loudly. He longed for Luo Tian to be killed by Fan Yongning, emphasizing the words "good relations" heavily. His gaze held a hidden meaning toward Fan Yongning.

Duan Chengfeng knew much about Fan Yongning. Zhu Fenghuo and Ruan Xinghe were powerful in the Tianmen Sect, but they were crushed by Tianmen's top prodigy Cen Hongwei. Yet Fan Yongning had fought Cen Hongwei for an hour. Remember, Cen Hongwei was an extreme-level cultivator.

Even if Luo Tian won, Duan Chengfeng wouldn't lose much. If he could draw out the three Grand Elders to kill Luo Tian, it would be even better.

"Haha, since it's personal matters, let you two settle it!" Hong Haosheng's expression never changed. He smiled at Fan Yongning.

As Hong Haosheng's words ended, the surrounding people scattered, watching with interest. They were confident in Fan Yongning, for his strength was beyond ordinary people. Though he was a Heavenly Immortal at the middle stage, no one regarded him as such.

"Thank you, Senior Brother!" Fan Yongning's eyes showed a hint of smile. From the start, he had only glanced at Luo Tian.

"Such matters shouldn't trouble Senior Brother! I'll handle it myself!" Before Fan Yongning could speak further, Mei Youbing stepped forward.

"Senior Brother, this trash isn't worthy of you. Let me handle it!"

"Indeed, let us deal with this trash!" The young men accompanying Yao Qishui spoke loudly, their voices filled with arrogance and contempt.

"Luo Tian, you've truly found the path to heaven but chose hell. Didn't know this was Chaos Heaven Sect's territory!" Yao Qishui laughed wildly, eyes filled with satisfaction.

Luo Tian didn't even glance at Yao Qishui. Though it seemed careless, Luo Tian had been watching Hong Haosheng. When Yao Qishui said "Chaos Heaven Sect's territory," Luo Tian felt a fleeting glint of killing intent in Hong Haosheng's eyes, but it vanished quickly.

"Yao Qishui, I let you go before. Didn't expect you to keep coming back. I gave you face in the gambling stone shop, but now you're back? My dear grandson?" Luo Tian sneered. He knew from the start he couldn't leave Chaos Heaven Sect smoothly.

Now, Luo Tian considered whether to unleash a massacre and eliminate these people. If he did, the three Grand Elders behind them would surely appear. What were their strengths?

If only one was a True Immortal, he might escape. But if two, he might not have a chance.

"Enough! Let me crush this kid!" As Mei Youbing stepped forward from the crowd, he said.

"Kid, do you not know how to write 'death'?" Mei Youbing's face showed a cold smile.

"Actually, you could all come. For me, you're enough to crush a group!" Luo Tian's face showed indifference, his eyes sneering.

"Seeking death!" Mei Youbing's face turned cold. His figure vanished instantly, appearing before Luo Tian. A plum blossom seal appeared on his arm, seemingly a secret technique.

"It's Plum Blossom Triple Waves! This kid is doomed!" Seeing the plum blossom mark on Mei Youbing's arm, Yao Qishui's people erupted in laughter.

"Crack..." But the next moment, a crackling sound accompanied by a scream echoed in people's ears. Mei Youbing came fast and left just as fast, his body becoming a streak of light flying toward the crowd.

"Boom..." His battered figure fell before people. Mei Youbing's pale face showed his right arm had vanished. He gazed at Luo Tian as if looking at a monster.

Luo Tian stood indifferent, his feet in a pool of blood that looked like blooming plum blossoms - beautiful yet chilling.

"Excellent!" Hong Haosheng nodded, his eyes bright. He gazed at Luo Tian, a strange light flashing in his eyes.

"What did he just do?" Everyone's faces showed disbelief. Though they knew Luo Tian was strong, they hadn't expected him to break Mei Youbing's arm with one punch.

"Unexpected. Didn't expect Tianmen Sect to have another person like you besides Cen Hongwei and Ruan Xinghe!" Fan Yongning spoke softly, but a killing aura radiated from him.

"There are more things you didn't expect!" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed. Though he felt Fan Yongning was no ordinary person, he didn't take it seriously. Though strong, Luo Tian knew if Fan Yongning wasn't an extreme-level cultivator, he would be crushed. After all, his body was also a major weapon.

"Kill..." Fan Yongning didn't speak further. His hands moved, two ink-black swords appeared in his grasp, instantly merging with the dark sky.

"Nothing more than that!" Luo Tian chuckled. His powerful spiritual sense immediately found the swords' movement path. He swung his arms, charging toward the two black swords.

"Brutish! Using your body to fight weapons. Only Iron Gate Sect people do that!" Everyone looked at Luo Tian as if he were a fool.

"Clang, clang..." Next moment, people were stunned. Sparks and collision sounds appeared in their perception.

A black and golden figure continuously crossed before people's eyes. Luo Tian's fists radiated overwhelming energy, constantly battling the two black swords.

"Don't let him get close! His body is变态 strong. Even a Heavenly Immortal at the late stage would be suppressed. Use powerful martial arts! He's an extreme-level cultivator!" Duan Chengfeng shouted at Fan Yongning.

"Extreme-level! Tianmen Sect has another one besides Cen Hongwei!" People gasped, gazing at Luo Tian who gradually suppressed Fan Yongning.

"Boom..." Duan Chengfeng's words had just finished when Fan Yongning and Luo Tian collided again, appearing before people.

Fan Yongning's clothes were in disarray. His arms trembled. He could no longer withstand it, and the two black swords fell to the ground with a clatter.

Luo Tian stood there, shaking his arms. Blood dripped from them, obviously having suffered damage from fighting weapons with his bare hands. But for Luo Tian, it was acceptable.

"Truly strong!" Fan Yongning caught his breath, eyes showing intense fear. He had clearly felt Luo Tian's strength.

"Murder!" But Fan Yongning was also a prodigy. His arms were numb, and he formed seals with his hands. The two black swords flew up again but no longer in his grasp. They hovered above his head.

"Will you use your martial arts?" Luo Tian's eyes flickered. Facing the martial arts of an artifact sword, he still stood there calmly.

Chapter 1856: Earth Shattering

"Draw your weapon, or you'll have no chance!" Seeing Luo Tian still standing there, Fan Yongning sneered.

"Come on, I don't need to draw my weapon!" Luo Tian spoke softly. It wasn't that he didn't want to, but the Rupture Heaven Spear had already fallen behind his body's growth.

"I need to upgrade the Rupture Heaven Spear as well!" Luo Tian thought. Now he had many methods, but he still preferred the Rupture Heaven Spear. He'd used it for years.

But the Rupture Heaven Spear was now a Dao-level treasure, one level lower than Fan Yongning's Black Ink Sword. There was no need to draw it out.

"Good kid, you'll pay the price!" Fan Yongning was thoroughly enraged by Luo Tian's attitude. Even Cen Hongwei hadn't looked down on him like this.

At that moment, Fan Yongning formed seals with his hands. A surge of black energy burst out, flowing into the two Black Ink Swords.

"Buzz..." The two swords suddenly expanded. They split into four, then eight...

Not long after, a series of black large swords hovered above everyone's heads. Each carried immense power, filling the sky and covering the moonlight, as if the world had fallen into darkness.

"Ten Thousand Swords Piercing the Heart!" Fan Yongning sneered, pointing at Luo Tian's direction.

"Clatter..." Next moment, a series of black large swords, with supreme power, formed into a black dragon and rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Dead for sure!" Everyone felt cold chills, gazing at the sky-piercing dragon.

"Ten Thousand Swords Piercing the Heart? I'll see who's heart it pierces!" Luo Tian's hands quickly changed, and complex seals flew out from his hands, covering his body.

The "Manifesting the World" technique was immediately activated. Luo Tian's body suddenly expanded, transforming into a hundred-foot-tall giant. Though his appearance didn't change, his aura soared to the heavens.

"What?" Seeing Luo Tian's body expand, people could feel the explosive power radiating from him. It was their first time witnessing such a great technique.

"Is he from the same place as that person?" Next, people thought of someone they had seen before. That person also expanded their body and was even stronger.

"No, he's different from that person. That person had a bloodline issue, but this one has entered this state through technique. He'll return to his original form soon!" Guan Haosheng's brows relaxed as he watched the sky-piercing Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." Next, Luo Tian moved. A gray stick suddenly expanded in his hand.

"Blessing..." Luo Tian waved the震仙笔, though it had no bristles. Its aura still shocked everyone.

"Kill..." The cries of battle echoed, making people feel as if they were in a chaotic battlefield. Countless soldiers' cries of battle echoed in their ears, and the killing aura swept across heaven and earth.

The golden character "Bing" (military) was drawn with a thunderous sound, pressing toward the black swords forming the dragon.

"Boom... Boom..." Next moment, a deafening explosion echoed like two armies clashing. The golden "Bing" character carried the aura of warfare, continuously destroying each black large sword.

"Ten... One hundred... One thousand..." In a moment, the swords were destroyed by the "Bing" character. Only two remained, and the "Bing" character disappeared from sight.

The chaotic aura swept over people, making them snap back to reality. Their faces showed shock as they gazed at Luo Tian.

"It's the震仙 Sect's "Bing Eight Styles"! But I heard that the震仙 Sect was destroyed by a youth riding three dogs. Could it be him!" People immediately thought of the震仙 Sect destroyed days ago.

"What!" Hearing the chaos sect people's murmurs, Duan Chengfeng's face suddenly changed. He clearly remembered that Luo Tian had a three-dog pet, and he had injured the three dogs before.

"Unexpectedly him!" Guan Haosheng licked his lips, eyes becoming brighter. He waved his hand and whispered to a senior.

"Eight Directions Treasure Retrieval!" Luo Tian extended his hand. The two black large swords were suddenly reversed, flying toward Fan Yongning under everyone's astonished gaze.

"Damn!" Everyone's eyes widened. Some elders even cursed, looking at the two large swords flying back.

"What happened!" Fan Yongning's face showed disbelief. He had a momentary feeling that the two black swords had escaped his control.

"Idiot, when fighting others, are you distracted?" A cold voice echoed in Fan Yongning's ears, making his face change.

"Pu... Pu..." The black swords vanished. Two dark large swords pierced into Fan Yongning's shoulders, pinning him to the ground.

Silence. At this moment, everything was completely silent. Everyone gazed at the hundred-foot-tall Luo Tian. They hadn't expected this Tianmen Sect prodigy to be so bold.

"It's not bravery, it's definitely abnormal!" Everyone looked at Luo Tian. The elder who had previously attacked Luo Tian in the hall instinctively trembled.

"Yao Qishui! Now do you still want to kill me?" Luo Tian gazed down at Yao Qishui, who was trembling.

"What do you want!" Yao Qishui was completely stunned by Luo Tian's aura. At this moment, he saw Luo Tian as a giant. He even forgot that this was the Chaos Heaven Sect, and his grandfather was one of the three Grand Elders about to enter True Immortality.

"Luo Tian, though you're strong, don't forget this is whose place. This is the Chaos Heaven Sect!" A weak voice echoed. Fan Yongning stood up with a pale face, his two black swords covered in blood falling to the ground. Fan Yongning held a green token.

"Open!" Then Fan Yongning threw the green token into the sky with force, emitting a burst of green light.

A series of green lights spread from the token, flying toward all directions.

"It's a Beast Summoning Token. Master Fan has given this to his disciple!" The disciples accompanying Fan Yongning immediately became excited.

Green lights enveloped the entire mountain peak. Then, the cages imprisoning beasts instantly vanished. Various fierce beasts roared and rushed toward Luo Tian's group.

Duan Chengfeng immediately felt his scalp tingle. He looked at the massive creatures, their bodies radiating fierce energy. One of them was even a True Immortal at the late stage.

"Fan Yongning, are you crazy!" Guan Haosheng's face showed coldness as he addressed Fan Yongning.

"Kill him!" Fan Yongning ignored Guan Haosheng's words. His trembling hands held the token, addressing the beasts.

"Roar..." The beasts roared. Their fierce eyes locked onto Luo Tian, making Luo Tian's face show a smile.

"Truly don't know where you got this Beast Summoning Token's replica!" Luo Tian chuckled, gazing at the beasts filling the mountain peak. He waved his hands, and a green seal suddenly flew out from his mind.

"Buzz..." At the moment the Beast Summoning Token appeared, all beasts stopped their movements. Their green eyes showed confusion, looking at Fan Yongning and the Beast Summoning Token hovering over Luo Tian.

"Go!" Luo Tian spoke softly. He pointed his finger, and a series of green lights flew out from the token, instantly entering each beast's body.

"Roar..." Next moment, hot energy burst from the beasts' eyes. Even two tigers over ten zhang long that had rushed toward Luo Tian stopped their bodies, gazing at him with intense eyes as if they'd become cats.

"Ah..." However, one beast wasn't affected by the Beast Summoning Token. A figure over dozens of zhang tall broke through the beasts, its red eyes glowing and radiating explosive power. A蛮荒 aura burst from its tall body, making Luo Tian's eyes turn red.

"War Spear!" Seeing the tall figure, Luo Tian's heart filled with killing intent. He could clearly feel Chen Zhanbiao's state was wrong, as if he had no mind. Also, Luo Tian saw Chen Zhanbiao's two fangs - something Chen Zhanbiao had always possessed.

"Luo Tian, this is the ascension candidate we captured. Please subdue them!" Guan Haosheng addressed Luo Tian. He could feel the beasts no longer posed a threat to Luo Tian.

"Ah..." As he spoke, Chen Zhanbiao's massive body walked toward Luo Tian. Seeing Luo Tian's red eyes showed a moment of confusion, but he still punched toward Luo Tian.

"Kill them!" At this moment, Luo Tian was completely mad. First, Long Jie had his scales stripped. Then he saw Chen Zhanbiao transformed like this. Now, Luo Tian had only one thought - to avenge them both, no matter what, just revenge. He would make the entire Chaos Heaven Sect turn upside down.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian spoke, he extended his hand and grabbed Chen Zhanbiao's fist that had punched toward him.

"Roar..." Hearing Luo Tian's words, all the beasts on the mountain peak went mad, rushing toward people on the mountain.

"What's going on!" Everyone was stunned. In an instant, two disciples were decapitated by two leopards.

"Stop!" Fan Yongning was completely panicked. He hadn't expected such a change. The beasts he had controlled were now under Luo Tian's control.

But the beasts seemed to ignore Fan Yongning's green token, rushing toward people on the mountain peak.

Chapter 1858: Escape

"No way out!" Though Luo Tian had prepared, his heart still tightened.

This formation was a death trap for him. No chance of escape. But Luo Tian wasn't going to surrender.

"Roar..." As Luo Tian thought, cold energy swept through heaven and earth. Ghostly figures凝聚 in the sky, making the Chaos Heaven Sect people gasp again.

"What are these things? How come there are so many ghosts in our sect!" Everyone was stunned by the ghostly figures. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to have this move.

"Controlling beasts, even ghosts within a hundred li of the Chaos Heaven Sect!" Not only others, but also the three Grand Elders showed disbelief.

"It's a Beast Summoning Token! A real one!" One old man like the sun stood there, gazing at the Beast Summoning Token above Luo Tian's head. He spoke in disbelief.

"Kid, you tricked me out of two king stones?" The old man holding Yao Qishui showed intense killing intent, gazing at Luo Tian.

"Exactly. Are you sure you want to fight me to the end?" Luo Tian was surrounded by ghosts and beasts, his face showing cruelty. If Chen Zhanbiao were清醒, he'd know Luo Tian was completely mad. When Luo Tian went mad, the consequences were severe. It was a madness without regard for consequences. In the Nine Realms, Luo Tian had gone mad only a few times, but each time it meant a sea of corpses.

"Threatening us? Haha. Even the Tianmen Sect leader wouldn't dare threaten us. You're just a Tianmen Sect disciple, how dare you threaten us? It's a big joke. Think you can eliminate us just because of this commotion?" The old man holding Mei Youbing laughed loudly, looking at Luo Tian as if he were a clown.

"Brother, these three are called Fan Tianming, Mei Guoqi, and Yao Tiancheng. Be careful!" Long Jie's voice echoed again in Luo Tian's mind. Though he tried to hide it, Luo Tian could hear Long Jie's intense hatred. It showed that Long Jie had suffered greatly at their hands.

"Fish and net, let's fight to the end!" Luo Tian's eyes deepened. He gazed at the three, knowing whether he could escape was uncertain. But Luo Tian could fight to the death, at least making the Chaos Heaven Sect suffer heavy losses.

"Then see if you have that ability!" Fan Tianming sneered, his body instantly vanishing and appearing before Luo Tian.

"Kill... Kill wildly!" Luo Tian roared, his hands moving. His robe flapped, and the震仙 Pen was summoned again. With a wave, four big characters suddenly凝聚, pressing toward Fan Tianming.

"Roar..." Hearing Luo Tian's words, countless ghosts rushed wildly toward the Chaos Heaven Sect disciples and elders. Beasts also showed fierce eyes, blocking Fan Tianming's path. They formed a powerful beast tide, rushing toward the blocking elders.

"Kill..." All Chaos Heaven Sect disciples shouted loudly. They couldn't count the ghosts, and they didn't fear death.

In an instant, the entire Chaos Heaven Sect was in chaos, forming a massive battlefield. Humans, beasts, and ghosts clashed continuously. Chaos Heaven Sect disciples immediately suffered heavy casualties.

"Trickery!" Fan Tianming's body was like a flying mountain, rushing toward Luo Tian. Countless ghosts and beasts couldn't stop Fan Tianming for even a breath, instantly scattering into blood mist or black smoke.

"Boom... Boom..." The four characters Luo Tian had summoned were also instantly shattered by Fan Tianming. But it made Fan Tianming's body slightly hesitate.

"Go..." Luo Tian didn't hesitate. He no longer cared about the Chaos Heaven Sect's battle. He knew this fight would surely cause heavy losses for the Chaos Heaven Sect, even if it didn't kill any main figures. Some elders would definitely not escape.

"Where are you going?" As Luo Tian just moved, Fan Tianming reached his side. His body was like a mountain, carrying heavy pressure and atmosphere.

"Get out..." Luo Tian roared. His Seven-Foot Step was immediately taken, golden legs colliding with Fan Tianming.

"Boom..." The golden leg image instantly collapsed. Luo Tian's body directly collided with Fan Tianming's.

"Cough... Cough..." Luo Tian's body flew like a broken kite, coughing blood. His face turned pale.

"Go..." Luo Tian didn't hesitate. He dragged his wounded body in the opposite direction. At this moment, he no longer cared where he was going. Just escaping was his top priority.

"His body is good!" Mei Guoqi's face showed a hint of surprise, his face showing a smile. But he stepped into the void and chased after Luo Tian.

"Come out!" Luo Tian's face showed coldness. He spat blood into the Beast Summoning Token. As he spat, a cold and icy aura suddenly erupted from the token. A terrifying pressure radiated from it. Four tall figures flew out of the Beast Summoning Token, their bodies radiating half-step True Immortal energy, even approaching True Immortality.

"Unexpected. He dared to cause trouble in the Chaos Heaven Sect because he had support!" Fan Tianming's eyes narrowed. He gazed at the four powerful ghosts.

"Senior Brother, let me handle these four!" Mei Guoqi's face showed a smile. True Immortal energy suddenly erupted, his body moving toward the four powerful ghosts.

"What is this? Are we in hell?" Chaos Heaven Sect disciples and elders trembled, fighting against the ghosts and beasts. The entire Chaos Heaven Sect was stained with blood in a short time.

"What support do you have?" Fan Tianming sneered, taking a step toward Luo Tian.

"No support. How dare I cause such a commotion?" Luo Tian flew quickly, seeing Fan Tianming move. He spoke coldly. A drop of spiritual blood flew from his hand, re-entering the Beast Summoning Token.

"Buzz..." The buzzing sound returned. A black figure emerged from the Beast Summoning Token. At the moment the black figure appeared, countless ghosts trembled, emitting a fervent aura.

"Hmm?" At the moment the black figure appeared, Fan Tianming's steps slightly paused. He felt a cold aura locking onto him. If he moved, it would face a storm of attacks. He gazed at the black figure.

"Ghost King!" Fan Tianming's eyes showed surprise after a careful look. His eyes burst with disbelief.

"Stop him!" Luo Tian addressed the Ghost King, then didn't care about other battles. He continued to escape, this being his greatest secret - a True Immortal Ghost King, enough to trouble anyone.

The Ghost King's sinister gaze looked at Luo Tian's escape. His eyes showed complex feelings. Through the Beast Summoning Token's nourishment, the Ghost King had now fully upgraded to True Immortal early stage with complete consciousness.

"Buzz..." However, the Ghost King didn't disobey Luo Tian's command. His body moved, turning into a black mist that covered the heavens and earth, rushing toward Fan Tianming.

"Senior Third, go get this kid back. Make sure he's alive. There must be a big secret on him!" Fan Tianming addressed Yao Tiancheng, his eyes showing greed.

Having control over ghosts and a complete Beast Summoning Token - just these two things were enough to make anyone desire it.

"Good!" Yao Tiancheng sneered, his body moving toward Luo Tian. He naturally knew Luo Tian had a secret. And just the Dragon Eye Crystal was enough to make True Immortals go mad.

"Buzz..." Light flashed. No one could stop Luo Tian. In an instant, he broke through the Chaos Heaven Mountain range.

"Must escape!" Luo Tian's heart roared. He felt only Yao Tiancheng was chasing him, his mind flashing with intense killing intent.

"Old man, now it's just you. That makes it easier!" Luo Tian sneered in his heart but pushed his speed to the maximum.

"Kid, where are you running!" Yao Tiancheng roared. His heart was also shocked by Luo Tian's speed, but he knew Luo Tian wouldn't last long. His distance to Luo Tian was getting closer.

"Black, take me away!" Luo Tian felt Yao Tiancheng approaching him. He naturally knew the level was there.

"Roar..." The three-dog dog growled, appearing before Luo Tian. Its eyes showed confusion but followed Luo Tian.

Luo Tian didn't hesitate. He stood on the three-dog's body, turned to look at Yao Tiancheng who was less than ten thousand zhang away.

The three-dog's speed was slightly faster than Luo Tian. It carried him like a black lightning bolt, continuously running.

"Kid, it's no use. I'll make you suffer!" Yao Tiancheng sneered. If not an hour, he would catch Luo Tian.

"Black, find a place with no people. Let's kill this old man!" Luo Tian sat on the three-dog, took out pills to recover.
