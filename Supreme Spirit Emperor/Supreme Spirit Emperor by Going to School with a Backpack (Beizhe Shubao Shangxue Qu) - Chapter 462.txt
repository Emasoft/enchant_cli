“Why is it so quiet…?” However, soon after, Luo Tian looked around and found that as he wandered aimlessly, the surrounding shops were all closed, and passersby had vanished. Luo Tian's surroundings seemed to form a vacuum, with him standing alone on the street.

At that moment, several figures gradually appeared in Luo Tian’s line of sight. Their eyes gleamed with coldness, and the leader was an old man whose aura radiated outward. Each step he took sent invisible ripples rising beneath him, sweeping toward Luo Tian.

“Wang Wendou?” Luo Tian recognized the old man from a small booklet given by Long Zaitian, which detailed figures in Heavenly Dragon City.

Wang Wendou, a practitioner of the Initial Stage of the Nascent Soul, was the chief steward of the Heavenly Dragon City Lord’s mansion. No one in the city dared to defy Wang Wendou except for Zuo Qiuming. He was second only to the city lord himself, and he cherished his son Wang Quandan dearly.

“Are you Luo Tian?” Wang Wendou’s face bore a cold glint as he gazed at Luo Tian and spoke solemnly.

“Yes, move aside. I’m not in the mood to chat with you! Don’t block my path!” Luo Tian spoke softly, yet his steps did not slow. He advanced steadily.

“I’ll cripple your limbs to avenge my son, then slowly torment you to death!” Wang Wendou sneered. Though he sensed Luo Tian was no easy opponent, his eyes gleamed with delight upon seeing the blood hole on Luo Tian’s abdomen.

“Heavenly Dragon City forbids disturbances. Are you defying your master’s will?” Luo Tian spoke coldly, drawing closer to Wang Wendou and his group.

“It forbids disturbances, but who am I? In Heavenly Dragon City, there’s nothing I, Wang Wendou, cannot accomplish!” Wang Wendou declared proudly. He knew Zuo Qiuming had entered the Dragon Gate to discuss recruiting disciples, and now Heavenly Dragon City was under his control.

“Kill him!” Wang Wendou waved his hand, and a group of men rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Originally I wanted to stay low-key, but alas…” Luo Tian’s face paled as he advanced toward Wang Wendou step by step. His golden spear materialized in his hand.

“Luo Tian, today you are doomed!” As Luo Tian walked, several young figures appeared in his path. Their powerful auras radiated outward, causing Luo Tian to narrow his eyes.

“Indeed, a troublemaker!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly. The newcomers were Li Haoran and his seven senior disciples, all at the Nascent Soul stage.

“Luo Tian! Here he is!” Figures emerged behind Luo Tian, their eyes alight with excitement.

“Kid, blame yourself for meddling with the wrong people!” The crowd roared. Over thirty to forty figures surrounded the street, most at the Dao Stage, with a few at the Nascent Soul stage.

“Such numbers!” Luo Tian furrowed his brows. Without a doubt, these people were followers of someone. In Heavenly Dragon City, the only person he had offended was Wan Youlan.

Chapter 1791: Killing in the City

“This is a problem!” Luo Tian’s heart grew heavy. Facing so many Nascent Soul and Dao Stage practitioners, it was a death sentence.

Yet Luo Tian understood that among these people, only Li Haoran and Wang Wendou aimed to kill him. The rest were Wan Youlan’s followers, some of whom might merely wish to teach him a lesson to impress Wan Youlan.

“Haha, Luo Tian, you’re still so arrogant!” As Luo Tian pondered, a loud laugh echoed from above. Two figures appeared over the crowd.

Though only two people, one of them was a middle-aged man who sent Luo Tian into a spiral of pressure. He felt these people combined were no match for the middle-aged man above.

“Yao Qishui!” Luo Tian recognized the ball beside the middle-aged man and sighed inwardly. He had been careless; if he had returned to his lodging immediately after leaving the Snowy Inn, the number of people following him would have been minimal.

“A moment’s negligence led me into this trap. How long has it been since I was so foolish!” Luo Tian clenched his spear.

“Qishui, I’ll capture this kid for you,” the middle-aged man spoke softly. To him, capturing a Nascent Soul was effortless.

“Not yet. I want to see this kid’s despair and relive my own feelings when he chased me,” Yao Qishui said with a grimace, recalling the despair he felt when Luo Tian hunted him. If not for some reason, he might have already died.

“Once we’ve tortured this kid to death, we’ll deliver him to your door!” Li Haoran shouted at the middle-aged man beside Yao Qishui.

“Tianmen Sect! How many people has this kid offended to dare defy the Tianmen Sect!” Hearing Li Haoran’s words, some bold onlookers gaped in horror at Luo Tian surrounded.

“Buzz…” As the two spoke, Wang Wendou’s group had already rushed toward Luo Tian. A man wielding a long sword swung his blade downward.

Golden light flashed, and in the next moment, the man remained frozen mid-swing. A golden spear had pierced his heart, exiting through his back. Blood dripped from the spear tip.

With a single pull, Luo Tian swung the spear like a staff and struck two more Dao Stage practitioners.

“Crack!” Two sharp sounds echoed. The two Dao Stage warriors were thrown backward like mountains had collided with them, spitting blood uncontrollably. They fell to the ground, kicking up dust, their eyes rolling back and breathing shallowly—clearly not long for this world.

“Attack together!” Wang Wendou barked, brandishing a staff. His Nascent Soul Initial Stage power surged as he rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Father, today I avenge you!” Li Haoran moved swiftly, joining his seven senior disciples in charging toward Luo Tian.

“Too many of them. Even if this kid dies, it’s none of our concern!” The followers of Wan Youlan also roared, closing in on Luo Tian.

“If you want my life, see how many of you will die with me!” Luo Tian pierced two more Dao Stage warriors. His face bore a wild look. He knew he had to fight for his life; otherwise, he had no chance. Not only were there these warriors, but the middle-aged man above Yao Qishui would leave him no choice but to flee.

“Fengyun Spear Technique!” Luo Tian, now desperate, unleashed terrifying power. Combined with his countless battles throughout his life—many more desperate than this—these people could not capture him.

“Buzz…” Golden spear shadows erupted around Luo Tian, who stood at the eye of the storm. He planted his spear into the ground and waved his hands, sending golden seals flying toward Wang Wendou.

“Boom!” The golden seal descended with immense pressure, accompanied by the divine technique of ‘Fanning Heaven’ and the power to overcome all obstacles. It struck Wang Wendou’s head, causing his face to pale.

“Open!” Wang Wendou swung his staff, sending a golden shadow toward the golden seal.

“Qixi, burn them!” Luo Tian pressed his palm to his forehead. Seven-colored flames flared, and a boy appeared before him. He opened his mouth, and the world turned scorching.

“Roar!” A seven-colored fire dragon surged skyward, sweeping outward. Luo Tian slapped his palm, and the Fire-Annihilating Inferno Array erupted. The fire dragon exploded into a sea of flames, instantly engulfing everyone.

“Screams!” A cry echoed. Some Dao Stage warriors touched the seven-colored flames and turned blackened. The Fire-Annihilating Inferno Array, fueled by spiritual energy, seemed to burn the heavens. Its power was overwhelming enough to threaten Nascent Soul practitioners. Dao Stage warriors who were weaker would suffer heavy injuries or even die.

Black smoke rose, and within moments, over a dozen Dao Stage warriors lay lifeless on the ground.

“Qishui, be careful!” The middle-aged man beside Yao Qishui looked in shock at Luo Tian standing amidst the fire and the seven-colored flames of Qixi. He raised a green barrier to shield himself.

“Human-form fire! This kid has many treasures. If he nurtures this human-form fire, it would be a powerful tool for the Tianmen Sect. It’s a waste to have this fire in his hands! His strength alone cannot nurture it!” The middle-aged man spoke softly.

“Uncle Wang, let me take this human-form fire!” Yao Qishui’s eyes gleamed with greed upon hearing the middle-aged man.

“Good.” The middle-aged man smiled, then extended his hand. A green hand descended from the sky toward Qixi.

“Qixi, return!” Luo Tian was about to rush toward others when he sensed a great danger and called out.

“Ah…” Qixi nodded, transforming into seven-colored flames that imprinted onto Luo Tian’s forehead.

“I’ll test how strong the Nascent Soul Intermediate Stage is!” Luo Tian roared, his eyes filled with endless battle spirit. He struck a palm toward the middle-aged man’s golden hand.

“Boom!” A thunderous sound echoed before Luo Tian. His body bent abruptly, his legs sinking into the ground. Cracks spread beneath him.

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian spat two mouthfuls of blood, his face pale. Yet others gave him no chance to recover. With Qixi’s departure, the fire’s power diminished significantly. Nascent Soul practitioners broke through the flames and rushed toward Luo Tian.

“Such a strong body!” The middle-aged man looked surprised. His previous strike had seemed casual, yet this kid only spat blood.

“Buzz…” Sword energy swept. Two Nascent Soul practitioners appeared before Luo Tian, their faces marked with exhaustion from the seven-colored flames.

“Get out…” Luo Tian swept his spear, deflecting their attacks. His mind was awestruck by the strength of Nascent Soul Intermediate Stage. Though he seemed unharmed, that strike had wounded him significantly. Especially with his abdomen pierced by Gu Qianxue, blood trickled out again.

“Luo Tian, today you are doomed!” Luo Tian repelled two Nascent Soul practitioners. Behind him came the cold voice again: Li Haoran and his seven senior disciples launched a powerful attack toward Luo Tian.

Eight swords formed a sword net, leaving no space for Luo Tian to escape. Yet Luo Tian had no chance to block their attacks, as Wang Wendou and other Nascent Soul practitioners also attacked him.

“Martial God Seven Steps to Crush the Ancient!” Luo Tian roared, summoning a massive shadow of himself before Wang Wendou.

“I die, but you die first!” Luo Tian’s eyes turned blood-red, clearly enraged. He suddenly turned and rushed toward the descending sword net.

As he ran, two Dao Stage warriors were crushed. The crowd gasped in awe, eyes filled with shock.

“An outstanding genius!” People thought at that moment. In such a desperate situation, Luo Tian still had the strength to fight back, proving his power.

“If he participated in the exam, he would surely be a target for the three major sects. Unfortunately, he will die here!” However, they soon began to discuss because over a dozen Nascent Soul attacks had surrounded Luo Tian, leaving no escape.

“Boom… boom…” Muffled sounds echoed. A small tower over ten feet high crashed onto Luo Tian’s back, followed by a bell. Each attack struck his back, causing him to spit blood uncontrollably. Yet he seemed like a cockroach that couldn’t be killed, his speed increasing dramatically due to their attacks.

His shadow flashed. Luo Tian vanished from sight. When people saw him again, Li Haoran’s sword net had shattered. A blood-red figure rushed toward the eight of them—Luo Tian, his robes stained with blood.

“Want to kill me? Then you die first!” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed. His eyes had turned blood-red.

“Die!” Li Haoran’s eyes showed fear as he met Luo Tian’s blood-red gaze, feeling the stare of death.

Chapter 1792: Your Life is Short

Cold energy pierced Li Haoran. His eyes remained shocked, and a golden spear pierced his throat.

“Senior Nine!” Li Haoran’s senior disciples cried out in shock.

“Don’t rush. I’ll send you to your deaths slowly!” Before they could recover from their shock, a cold voice echoed again. Luo Tian appeared before two of Li Haoran’s disciples.

The Great Dao Sealing Fist swung, combined with the Banishing King Battle Technique. It struck a youth’s chest.

One fist pierced through space, and the youth’s eyes widened in terror as his chest was torn open by Luo Tian.

“Explosion…” Luo Tian clenched his hand, exploding the youth’s heart. His other hand formed a seal of the Divine King Nine Heavens, striking another youth.

Luo Tian’s attacks on both were simultaneous. As one youth died, the other was struck by the Nine Heavens technique.

Blood and flesh scattered. The youth had no time to react, being shattered by the nine major lands.

“Crash…” Nine major lands turned into a gust of wind, sweeping around. Luo Tian became a bloodied figure standing there, his body covered in wounds. A faint golden light emanated from the wounds. His spear, stained with blood, was in his hand.

“This…” The battlefield fell silent for a moment. Everyone’s eyes were filled with shock, watching Luo Tian who had killed three of Li Haoran in an instant.

“Those were three sect disciples! How could they die so quickly!” Everyone’s hearts trembled. At that moment, Luo Tian was a monster in their eyes.

Not a monster but a god of death. The battle had taken only moments, and over twenty Dao Stage warriors lay dead, along with five Nascent Soul practitioners.

Blood dyed the ground. The street was in ruins. People looked at Luo Tian, panting heavily, with reverence. Such a feat would be impossible for even the top geniuses of sects.

“Terrifying!” The middle-aged man beside Yao Qishui also showed shock. Even as an enemy, he couldn’t help but admire.

“Uncle Wang, what do you think? Can you do the same?” Yao Qishui looked puzzled.

“You don’t understand. I mean this kid’s combat awareness is terrifying. He was in a desperate situation but escaped with minimal cost and killed three Nascent Soul Initial Stage practitioners.”

“This combat awareness is beyond ordinary people! Even the long-time battle enthusiast of the Tianmen Sect, Qiu Tianba, couldn’t do it. This awareness is too terrifying!” The middle-aged man spoke softly, already sentencing Luo Tian to death in his mind. If this enemy grew stronger, it would be a major threat.

“Don’t come!” Seeing Luo Tian covered in blood, several Dao Stage warriors roared and fled. They were terrified of Luo Tian.

“I surrender!” One led the way, and other Dao Stage warriors followed suit. Even some Nascent Soul practitioners showed fear and retreated with the Dao Stage warriors.

They had only intended to teach Luo Tian a lesson, but things had escalated beyond their expectations. They thought killing one Nascent Soul was easy, but Luo Tian’s bloody reality had slapped them hard. Who knew if the next victim would be them.

Not only did these people tremble, but even Wang Wendou and Li Haoran’s group felt fear.

“Come on!” Luo Tian roared, his blood-red eyes scanning the crowd with disdain. His voice was arrogant.

“Is that so?” Luo Tian sneered, showing his white teeth, which looked eerie. Then, as if about to collapse, he slightly bent and vanished from sight.

“Buzz…” When he reappeared, he stood atop Wang Wendou’s head. A blood-red foot pressed down toward Wang Wendou.

“Invulnerable to All Techniques!” Wang Wendou’s face changed, but he could only grit his teeth and raise a barrier.

“Crack!” The barrier shattered under the blood-red foot. The Martial God’s form also collapsed, and a blood-stained spear appeared above Wang Wendou.

“Die!” Wang Wendou spat out old blood in the moment the barrier shattered but could only curse before his body fell.

Luo Tian’s feet crushed Wang Wendou’s hands. Wang Wendou’s arms cracked, and he collapsed on the ground.

“Old man, die!” Luo Tian roared. He gripped his blood-stained spear and raised it high, its cold light flashing as he aimed for Wang Wendou’s back.

“Ah…” Wang Wendou screamed desperately. In the face of death, he unleashed his full potential. His body writhed in desperation.

“Plop…” The spear was supposed to pierce Wang Wendou’s back but instead struck his shoulder, pinning him to the ground.

Everyone was stunned. Their eyes showed disbelief. No one expected that even wounded, Luo Tian still had the strength to fight back. Wang Wendou had previously claimed Luo Tian was powerless, but now Luo Tian had slapped his face again. Wang Wendou’s price would be his life.

The spear was pulled out, taking a large amount of blood with it. Luo Tian raised his spear again and aimed for Wang Wendou, who could no longer move.

“Stop!” At the moment the spear was about to pierce Wang Wendou’s heart, a powerful pressure descended from above. Zuo Qiuming appeared in the sky with a dark face, releasing his Nascent Soul Intermediate Stage pressure. A golden hand instantly appeared before Luo Tian’s spear, blocking his attack.

Luo Tian’s face changed. He knew he had no chance to kill Wang Wendou and leapt into the air, landing ten feet away from Wang Wendou.

“Master!” Wang Wendou could still speak despite his severe injuries. Seeing Zuo Qiuming arrive, he looked delighted and shouted.

“What happened!” Zuo Qiuming’s face darkened. He gazed at the bloodstained ground and the corpses, shouting.

“Master, you must avenge me! This kid caused trouble in our Heavenly Dragon City. I wanted to capture him, but he resisted and killed so many people!” Wang Wendou immediately blamed Luo Tian.

“Shameless!” People heard Wang Wendou’s lies and thought poorly of him but said nothing.

“Again you!” Zuo Qiuming looked at Luo Tian, his brows furrowed. After careful recognition, he finally identified the person as the one who had caused trouble outside Heavenly Dragon City.

“It was me!”

“But Master Zuo, your steward’s talent for twisting truth is truly remarkable!” Luo Tian secretly recovered his strength and mocked.

“Indeed, it was your servant who came to kill me. Yet you blame everything on me. In terms of shamelessness, I only respect your steward!” Luo Tian’s face bore disdain as he spoke.

“Even if there was a mistake, your servant shouldn’t be punished by you. Killing in Heavenly Dragon City is punishable by death!” Zuo Qiuming’s face bore coldness. He struck a palm toward Luo Tian.

A golden hand, filled with overwhelming power, flew toward Luo Tian. Though it seemed slow, it instantly arrived at his head.

Yet Luo Tian’s face remained calm, as if he hadn’t seen the golden hand that could kill him.

“Is he stunned?” People looked in surprise at Luo Tian standing still.

“He must have realized he couldn’t match Zuo Qiuming and gave up resistance!” Li Haoran’s remaining five disciples looked relieved.

“Let Zuo Qiuming kill him too!” Yao Qishui’s middle-aged man sighed softly.

“He should be grateful he didn’t fall into my hands!” Yao Qishui’s face bore a grimace, watching Luo Tian with a smile.

“Master Zuo, if I’m not mistaken, you won’t live three years either. Only I can save you in this world!” As people thought Luo Tian was doomed, he stood there and spoke confidently.

“Boom…” The golden hand shattered at a distance of one foot from Luo Tian’s head, turning into waves of terrifying spiritual energy that battered him.

“What did you say?” Zuo Qiuming’s face changed abruptly. His eyes stared intently at Luo Tian.

“Master Zuo, does your head, armpit, and second rib hurt every midnight?” Luo Tian smiled and gazed at Zuo Qiuming.

“Yes!” Zuo Qiuming nodded. In fact, when Luo Tian said he wouldn’t live three years, Zuo Qiuming had already believed eight out of ten. Because Luo Tian’s words matched what a respected alchemist from the Dragon Gate had said.

“Do you think you can cure me?” Zuo Qiuming looked at Luo Tian, his voice solemn. Yet everyone could hear the excitement in his tone.

“Buzz…” But before Luo Tian could answer, a cold glint descended from the sky toward Luo Tian. The attacker was the middle-aged man accompanying Yao Qishui.

“Here is my territory!” Zuo Qiuming sneered and waved his sleeve. A golden dragon flew from his hand.

Chapter 1793: Ink Frost Centipede Poison

“Boom…” The golden dragon collided with the green cold glint above Luo Tian, causing people to gasp in surprise.

The cold glint was shattered. Zuo Qiuming’s feet pushed off the ground, and he vanished from his spot, appearing above Luo Tian. He struck a palm.

“Boom!” A muffled sound echoed in the sky. Two figures suddenly retreated, appearing before people.

“Wang Tianlong, what is your intention?” Zuo Qiuming spoke coldly. His gaze was sharp at the middle-aged man who had clashed with him, who was Wang Tianlong, the one accompanying Yao Qishui to protect him.

“This kid has a grudge with our Tianmen Sect, so I wanted to kill him!” Wang Tianlong’s face bore tension. He looked at Zuo Qiuming.

“Tianmen Sect, scaring others is fine. This is Heavenly Dragon City. I have no control over it!” Zuo Qiuming’s face bore coldness, showing no respect for Tianmen Sect. His voice was霸道.

“Master Zuo truly believes this kid can cure your illness?” Wang Tianlong’s face bore disdain. He looked at Luo Tian.

“Whether it can be cured or not is my problem. You don’t have the right to interfere!” Zuo Qiuming’s eyes bore disdain. He gave no face to Wang Tianlong.

“Enough, disperse! This matter ends here. No one can touch this kid now!”

“If you want to stay in Heavenly Dragon City, be quiet. If not, leave!” Zuo Qiuming spoke loudly, his gaze authoritative as he looked at everyone. Finally, he turned to Wang Tianlong.

“Yes!” Everyone heard Zuo Qiuming’s words and bowed in respect. They couldn’t afford to offend him. Those who knew the truth understood that Zuo Qiuming had some say in the Dragon Gate.

“Master Zuo, be careful!” Wang Tianlong’s face was dark. They had suffered a loss, but this was Heavenly Dragon City. Zuo Qiuming now represented the Dragon Gate. Though Tianmen Sect was strong, they dared not offend Zuo Qiuming.

“Truly a twist of fate. I never thought Luo Tian would kill so many people and still have no trouble!” People sighed, stood up, and left.

“Kid, this matter we will remember. This isn’t over!” The one who suffered the most was the Shock Sect, with eight people killed three of them. It was truly embarrassing.

“See if you have the ability!” Luo Tian’s face was pale, but his eyes bore disdain. He looked at those who had retreated.

“Go back and tell Wan Youlan and Du Changtian. I, Luo Tian, remember this grudge. When I recover, I’ll settle the account slowly!” Luo Tian’s gaze turned to Wang Wendou, who was barely alive.

Wang Tianlong looked at Luo Tian. His eyes bore no concealment of killing intent. Luo Tian’s strength was truly terrifying. Wang Tianlong felt some regret, not having acted immediately as Yao Qishui suggested. If he had attacked at the beginning, Luo Tian would have died for sure. There was no need to wait for Zuo Qiuming.

“Kid, your master’s illness isn’t easy to cure!” Wang Tianlong knew that with Zuo Qiuming present, Luo Tian was temporarily safe. He couldn’t touch him.

“Whether it’s easy or not to cure, you don’t have the right to interfere!” Luo Tian sneered. At this point, both sides were at odds. There was no need for Luo Tian to be cautious. If it weren’t for Zuo Qiuming’s arrival, coincidentally he could heal Zuo Qiuming, he would have been killed by Wang Tianlong.

“Go!” Wang Tianlong heard Luo Tian’s words. His face showed no expression. He pulled the reluctant Yao Qishui out of the crowd. Others also left, leaving only Luo Tian, Zuo Qiuming, and Wang Wendou.

“Master Zuo, how do you plan to deal with this steward?” Luo Tian smiled and looked at Zuo Qiuming, clearly not wanting Wang Wendou to live.

“Kid, don’t push it. I’ve stopped so much trouble. Don’t overstep!” Zuo Qiuming furrowed his brows.

“You’ve broken my legs and sent people to kill me. I had no choice but to defend myself!” Luo Tian spoke, looking at Wang Wendou. This was a test for Zuo Qiuming. If he immediately killed Wang Wendou, it would prove he was heartless. Then, when treating Zuo Qiuming, Luo Tian would have to be careful.

“Moreover, from what I know, Wang’s family in Heavenly Dragon City has done many bad things behind your back!” Luo Tian smiled and spoke to Zuo Qiuming.

“He is my steward. He has been with me for years. No功劳, but he has hardships. I won’t interfere with your matters. However, this is conditional: you must heal me. If not, I don’t need to explain your fate!” Zuo Qiuming’s eyes bore a cold glint.

“Master Zuo, as a healer, you should have compassion. If you don’t trust me, then kill me with one palm!” Luo Tian sneered, clearly angry at Zuo Qiuming’s doubt.

“Haha, Master, don’t believe his lies!” Wang Wendou spoke tremblingly. If Zuo Qiuming didn’t protect him, how could he be a match for Luo Tian.

“Don’t resist!” But before Wang Wendou could continue mocking, Zuo Qiuming’s voice interrupted him. Wang Wendou felt a chill and involuntarily shivered.

“Buzz…” Cold air rose from Zuo Qiuming, instantly covering him in frost. The coldness spread outward, as if it could freeze everything.

“Open…” Zuo Qiuming roared. The frost melted instantly, and the three silver needles fell into his hand. Zuo Qiuming’s eyes showed excitement. In that brief moment, he felt the long-standing illness weakening.

“Luo brother, if you can heal my illness, I’ll protect you in the Dragon Gate!” Zuo Qiuming’s eyes showed excitement. He changed his address to Luo Tian.

“Master Zuo, I need rest now. Once I recover, I’ll treat you!” Luo Tian smiled, secretly sighing that this time he had accidentally hit Zuo Qiuming’s acupoint, doubling the effect.

“Good. Luo brother, come with me to the city lord’s mansion for rest!” Zuo Qiuming extended his hand, supporting Luo Tian who was swaying. He flew into the air with Luo Tian, disappearing from Wang Wendou’s sight.

“Damn!” The entire street was left to Wang Wendou alone. His face was pale as he watched Zuo Qiuming and Luo Tian vanish, his eyes filled with a dark expression.

Wang Wendou stood there, thinking for a while before walking away in a hasty manner toward the city lord’s mansion.

Zuo Qiuming was excited, flying with Luo Tian for a while before arriving at the grand city lord’s mansion. The mansion stood like a coiled dragon, echoing with the Dragon Gate.

“Luo brother, rest here. If you need anything, just tell the servants! You are a guest of my city lord’s mansion!” Zuo Qiuming smiled, leading Luo Tian to a luxurious room. Several maids stood respectfully, their eyes curious as they looked at the bloodied Luo Tian.

“Thank you, Master Zuo. Could you tell me how you were infected by this cold energy? It will help me prepare for the treatment!” Luo Tian lay on the bed, taking out a pill and placing it in his mouth to recover while speaking to Zuo Qiuming.

“This is a long story. At that time, I had just become the Heavenly Dragon City Lord and led people into a dangerous place. I encountered a Frost Centipede comparable to the Nascent Soul Intermediate Stage. Although I eventually killed the Frost Centipede, only I and my steward, Wang Wendou, remained.”

“The Frost Centipede’s final attack implanted its core into my body. It exploded later. I should have reached the Nascent Soul Late Stage by now, but due to this cold poison, my cultivation has been stagnant!” Zuo Qiuming sighed.

“Wang Wendou also suffered heavy injuries. That’s why I didn’t want you to kill him. Over the years, I’ve understood some of his actions in Heavenly Dragon City. But I’ll turn a blind eye for the sake of our past survival!” Zuo Qiuming sighed.

“Frost Centipede’s core poison, and it was comparable to the Nascent Soul Intermediate Stage!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed admiration. Zuo Qiuming must have been a genius back then.

“Do you think you can cure it? Don’t worry, Luo brother. I don’t expect you to fully recover, but just to delay my life by decades!” Zuo Qiuming looked at Luo Tian.

“Master Zuo, rest assured. I’ll do my best. After all, a healer’s heart is like a parent’s!” Luo Tian smiled.

Chapter 1795: Poisoning

Three days passed quickly. Luo Tian, Long Youlan, and Long Zaitian had fully settled into the city lord’s mansion.

In a quiet courtyard of the city lord’s mansion, Luo Tian sat there while Long Zaitian and Long Youlan sat beside him.

“Hero and benefactor, Gu Qianxue hasn’t shown any abnormalities recently. Other geniuses who visited also refused to see her, but Gu Qianxue’s strength surprised people. Previously, someone tried to forcibly enter the Snowy Inn but was thrown out without exception!”

“Also, your achievements have spread throughout Heavenly Dragon City. Now everyone knows that besides the sect geniuses, others regard you as the strongest!” Long Zaitian spoke at length, recounting the news he had gathered over two days to Luo Tian.

“Hmm. Have there been any movements from those people?” Luo Tian asked again, his eyes showing a cold glint.
