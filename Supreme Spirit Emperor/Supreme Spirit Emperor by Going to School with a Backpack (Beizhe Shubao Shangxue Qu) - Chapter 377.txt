“You’re all bad people!” The boy looked at the one chasing him, who had become two, and his clear voice rang out again.

“Catch him for me, Pidan, Ergou…” The boy’s voice called out names one by one, and at the same time, the entire forest erupted in a thunderous roar.

“What’s going on!” Fu Xingyue and the others, who were searching, looked at the iron tree that suddenly burst forth with confusion.

“Crash…!” A thick trunk swung toward Fu Xingyue, emitting a whistling wind that made Fu Xingyue frown.

“Crack…!” Fu Xingyue shattered the trunk, which was stronger than refined iron, with a punch. His arm felt numb, and then he heard the boy’s voice again. His face changed abruptly as two long streaks of light shot through the air, passing Fu Xingyue and chasing after the boy.

At the same time, others in the forest faced the same dilemma as Fu Xingyue. After hearing the boy’s voice, they saw two long streaks of light passing over their heads.

“Damn it… it’s an immortal herb that has taken human form!” Everyone became frantic and joined the chase for the immortal herb.

“Damn it, they all know now!” Tu Feiyang cursed in his heart, watching the figures behind him. He cursed Luotian; if it weren’t for Luotian’s sudden intrusion, he might have already captured the immortal herb in his desperate struggle.

“Everyone is bad…” The boy felt more people behind him and cried out, causing the entire forest to rage. Every blade of grass and tree seemed imbued with powerful spiritual awareness, blocking Luotian’s group.

However, the cultivation levels of Luotian and his companions were formidable. Though these ironwood trees and plants were strong, they could not withstand the group’s destruction. They smashed through branches and overturned the ground, as if tearing open the entire forest.

Though they all chased together, some moved faster than others. Luotian and Tu Feiyang led the group at the front, while Fan Jingyu and Jin Ziyang followed closely. Behind them were Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang, with Manhun at the rear.

“Damn it, you’re slowing me down!” Manhun’s face showed anger. As he flew, his body suddenly expanded into a giant of the Man tribe, and with each step, his speed increased. However, the trees suffered.

“Grandpa, save me!” The boy cried out as he saw the figures behind him with rising energy. His speed increased even more, and even Luotian felt a sense of alarm.

“Damn it, what’s the form of this immortal herb!” Tu Feiyang looked anxious. He had used a special method to achieve his current speed, but if they continued like this, it would be disadvantageous for him.

“Everyone, save me!” The boy’s voice echoed through the forest as his small body flew deeper into it.

Luotian and the others followed with heavy hearts, sensing that the boy had no limits. Luotian’s group was fast, but the boy was even faster.

As they delved deeper, the scent of plants became more intense, making Luotian reluctant to destroy this beautiful environment.

“Roar…” A low growl echoed, and a massive green mouth suddenly rose from the ground, swallowing Luotian and Tu Feiyang.

“Have these plants become sentient?” Tu Feiyang waved his hand, and a blood blade flew out to split the green mouth.

They had encountered such obstacles countless times on this journey. Though they caused no real harm, they severely hindered their speed.

As they delved deeper, the plants that had become sentient grew increasingly troublesome.

“Hum…” A pure light fell, and golden thorns instantly appeared before Luotian’s group.

“Plop…” Due to their speed, even Luotian didn’t react in time and was pierced by the golden thorns into his invincible body.

A white light flowed over his body as Luotian forced the golden thorns out of his shoulder, his eyes filled with deep concern. He felt a numbness on his shoulder.

Others were also hit, pierced by one or several thorns. Their faces changed as they couldn’t match Luotian’s strong body, and the golden thorns only penetrated half an inch before stopping.

“Boom…” Manhun was tall, so he was pierced the most. As he tried to remove the thorns, his body felt unresponsive and fell to the ground.

“What’s going on…” Fu Xingyue and others looked puzzled, watching Manhun fall to the ground. Their faces changed as they realized their bodies felt unresponsive and fell straight down.

“Be careful…” Luotian moved swiftly, rushing toward Fu Xingxuan who was falling and caught her in his arms.

As soon as he held her, a fresh scent entered Luotian’s nose. This was the first time he had been so close to Fu Xingxuan. He glanced at her purple eyes and then looked away.

Luotian inwardly sighed, believing that any man would lose control. Fu Xingxuan was too beautiful; even up close, there were no flaws.

Fu Xingxuan’s face turned red. Her body was numb, but her face pressed against Luotian’s chest, generating a strange sense of security.

“Plop… plop…” As for the others, Luotian didn’t care. They fell one by one in a clumsy manner.

Luotian also placed Fu Xingxuan on the ground, attempting to let her stand up. However, she remained weak and leaned against him.

“Truly…” Luotian grabbed the thorn on Fu Xingxuan’s shoulder and said softly, “Feeling any better? Try to circulate the Epoch Power!”

“I feel a little better. But I still need some time to recover. Please help me pull out the other two, I can’t move right now!” Fu Xingxuan’s face turned red as she spoke to Luotian.

“Uh…” Luotian was stunned for a moment, then his gaze swept over Fu Xingxuan’s delicate body. His mouth twitched slightly.

One thorn was piercing just six or seven inches below Fu Xingxuan’s neck, right above her prominent curve. It made Luotian hesitant to act.

The other thorn was embedded in Fu Xingxuan’s abdomen, causing Luotian to pause. After all, Fu Xingxuan was still a maiden; if he pulled out the thorns for her, it would be like taking advantage of her.

“Hurry up, don’t dawdle!” Seeing Luotian standing there, Fu Xingxuan guessed his thoughts. To ease the awkwardness, she shouted loudly, snapping Luotian out of his trance.

“Hmph…” Luotian inwardly scoffed at himself. If Fu Xingxuan wasn’t afraid, why should he be?

Thinking this through, Luotian waved his hand and pulled out the thorn from Fu Xingxuan’s abdomen. His other hand was not idle, directly pulling out the second thorn. Perhaps due to natural causes, this thorn was almost entirely embedded in Fu Xingxuan’s body. To pull it out, he had to touch that area.

Though only for a moment, the tingling sensation triggered Fu Xingxuan’s nerves. Her face turned red, but after removing the two thorns, her condition improved significantly, allowing her to stand up on her own.

“Damn it!” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang, though paralyzed, still had sharp eyes. Luotian’s speed was fast, but how could he escape their sight? They couldn’t help but curse.

“Coward!” Not only Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang cursed, but even Tu Feiyang and others couldn’t help cursing. Fu Xingxuan was someone they all had a fondness for, wanting to bring her into their own group.

“Sigh…” Luotian sighed deeply and approached Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang, pulling out the thorns from their bodies.

“Stop arguing; if you keep it up, you’ll just stay here!” Luotian heard Tu Feiyang and others cursing and then his eyes flashed with a cold glint.

“Uh…” Hearing Luotian’s icy voice, Tu Feiyang and Jin Ziyang felt a slight hesitation. They suddenly realized Luotian’s other identity: a human clan prodigy, and humans and the ancient royal clans were natural enemies.

At that moment, they four could not move. If Luotian took the opportunity to kill them, it would be a tragic death.

Luotian let out a cold snort and approached Tu Feiyang. His white hand swung fiercely, landing a slap on Tu Feiyang’s buttocks while simultaneously pulling out a thorn with his fingers.

“Damn it!” Tu Feiyang’s face turned red, feeling a strong humiliation. If his eyes could kill, Luotian would have been wiped out countless times.

Though he had considered killing them, it would definitely cause trouble for Fu Xingyue. However, Luotian had no intention of letting them go either. He pointed his finger, and a series of seals flew out from his hand, wrapping around the four.

Chapter 1503: Qiankun Soul Tree

“What are you doing, Luotian?” Tu Feiyang looked at the seals wrapping around his body and felt a sudden jolt. He even subconsciously called out Luotian’s name.

“Sorry, it’s a bit of a bother for you. Please endure for a while!” Luotian smiled, not waiting for Tu Feiyang to resist. A wave of sealing power spread through Tu Feiyang’s body.

“Damn it!” Jin Ziyang, Manhun, and Fan Jingyu also shouted in anger, their eyes filled with fury as they looked at Luotian.

“Hum…” Luotian waved his hand, and a black yin fish appeared above the four, like a massive mouth. It swallowed them into its space.

“Haha… welcome to my world!” The yin fish’s spirit stood beneath the black space, laughing lightly as it addressed Tu Feiyang and the others.

“Luotian, are you really going to kill them?” Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingyang, and Fu Xingxuan looked at Luotian with confusion, fearing he might do something reckless. After all, Luotian had already dared to act against the ancient royal clan’s prince and a high-level cultivator.

“Don’t worry, I won’t kill them. Just suppress them for a few days. Once I leave the Netherworld, I’ll release them back. Otherwise, when we exit the Netherland, if my identity is exposed, I might have trouble leaving!” Luotian spoke softly, reassuring them.

Although three great cultivators stood behind him, it was still the Netherworld. Luotian couldn’t risk his life by trusting Tu Feiyang and the others to not harm him after they left.

Luotian had long wanted to imprison them, but he hadn’t found a good opportunity. This time, their paralysis due to the thorns provided him with that chance.

Moreover, the immortal herb was extremely precious for Luotian and his group. Naturally, they didn’t want it to be taken by Tu Feiyang.

“Hmm, as long as the soul lamp doesn’t go out, they four won’t have any problems!” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang nodded in agreement. They then sat cross-legged to recover.

While they recovered, Luotian flew up again toward the source of the thorns.

“Hum…” A series of breaking sounds echoed, making Luotian’s face show a slight smile. He waved his hand, creating a white barrier to enclose himself.

“Plop… plop…” Golden thorns pierced the barrier, and Luotian’s eyes saw their source through it.

In his vision was a plant resembling a cactus. However, this plant was entirely golden, with each thorn emitting a cold glow and radiating intense vitality.

“Sacred medicine, Eight-Pronged Thorn!” Luotian was stunned. He looked at the golden sacred medicine with disbelief.

“Come here!” His white hand extended, and Luotian grabbed the thorn-covered Eight-Pronged Thorn, pulling it out by the roots.

“Hum…” The golden Eight-Pronged Thorn trembled in Luotian’s hand, as if possessing a bit of intelligence.

“This is strange!” Luotian was puzzled. As a master of alchemy, he was familiar with sacred medicines and had even consumed them before. He knew the Eight-Pronged Thorn well, but it was rare for it to evolve into a sacred medicine. This was the first time he had seen such an occurrence, leaving him in awe.

“What is that immortal herb? Could it be the one that followed Master Duan Tian?” Luotian’s mind stirred, recalling legends about Master Duan Tian.

“Qiankun Life-Soul Tree!” Luotian was shocked. Master Duan Tian, the only one remembered as a great ruler of an epoch, naturally knew about his immortal herb.

The Qiankun Life-Soul Tree had its own unique characteristics, just like other immortal herbs. Its feature was that the surrounding medicinal plants gradually developed some intelligence.

“There’s an 80% chance it is!” Luotian smiled, collecting the Eight-Pronged Thorn. A bold idea formed in his mind.

“How is it?” As soon as Luotian collected the thorn, Fu Xingyue and the others appeared at his side with serious expressions.

“If I’m not mistaken, that human-form immortal herb is the Qiankun Life-Soul Tree!” Luotian smiled, sharing his guess with them.

“Hiss…” Hearing Luotian’s words, Fu Xingyue and the others inhaled sharply. They clearly knew about the legendary Master Duan Tian.

“If we truly capture it, we’ll have a big gain!” Fu Xingyue and the others looked excited. They clearly understood the role of the Qiankun Life-Soul Tree.

“But that kid is too fast. After wasting so much time, where do we find it?” Fu Xingxuan spoke softly, looking at Luotian. She seemed to have forgotten the previous intimacy, but her slightly red face betrayed her.

“Continue searching. Be careful; this forest is no simple place. There might be some medicinal herbs that have evolved into sacred medicines, even developing a bit of intelligence. They might attack us under the Qiankun Life-Soul Tree’s orders!” Luotian spoke softly, but he didn’t take it seriously. After all, their strength was there; being careful should be fine.

“The key is how we find it. That immortal herb is too timid to be found. Don’t forget our main goal!” Fu Xingxuan looked at Luotian, her purple eyes showing a touch of melancholy.

“Finding that kid? There’s still hope!” Luotian smiled, pointing his finger. A wisp of gray mist landed on his palm.

“This is a fragment of the soul from that Eight-Pronged Thorn. I can find that kid through its soul!” Luotian smiled, then pointed his finger.

“Hum…” The gray soul trembled violently in Luotian’s hand before calming down and flying toward the distance.

“Follow it!” Luotian smiled, leaping into the air to follow the gray soul. Fu Xingyue and the others closely followed, their eyes filled with anticipation.

Throughout the journey, Luotian’s group encountered the terrifying power of the Qiankun Life-Soul Tree. Medicinal herbs constantly attacked them, blocking their path with fire-spitting petals, lightning-releasing herbs, and illusion-inducing plants. Though they were quite troublesome, they only delayed the group slightly before becoming treasures in their storage rings.

After an hour of traversing, they finally broke through the dense forest. As they took a deep breath, their faces suddenly changed.

“This…” Without the thick forest, it returned to its dead state. A gray tower stood before Luotian’s group.

The gray tower pierced through the gray mist, making it impossible for Luotian to see its top. A powerful pressure descended upon their bodies.

“This can’t be…” Fu Xingyue spoke in a trembling voice, looking at the tower blocking their path with disbelief.

“Qiankun Soul-Subduing Tower!” Fu Xingyang spoke in a trembling voice, his tone filled with excitement. He recalled the description of Master Duan Tian’s epoch treasure in the Star Moon Clan’s records.

“Hum…” A humming sound echoed from Fu Xingxuan’s storage ring, with brilliant light spreading. The Star Moon Divine Spear emitted a radiant glow and flew out on its own, radiating an overwhelming aura.

“It must be right. Let the Star Moon Divine Spear protect us on its own. This must have been due to our previous confrontation!” Fu Xingyue’s eyes were filled with admiration as he looked at the magnificent tower.

“Hum…” As Luotian and others stared in awe, the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Tower emitted a humming sound, clashing with the Star Moon Divine Spear’s aura.

“I’ve been waiting for you all a long time!” A deep voice echoed from the tower, and gray mist surged. The mist formed a ghostly old figure before Luotian’s group.

“Who are you?” Luotian and others stood under the Star Moon Divine Spear, their eyes filled with confusion as they looked at the ghostly old man.

“I am the spirit of this tower!” The old man spoke softly, his gaze directed at the Star Moon Divine Spear.

“Ah! I see. It’s the Star Moon Divine Spear of the Star Moon Clan. That’s why it felt familiar. I remember that my master once caught it with his bare hands!” The old man spoke softly, a nostalgic tone in his voice.

“You have no right to be so proud. It was only because Master Duan Tian was strong, not because of our battle. If my master were still alive, I might not have lost!” A low voice echoed, golden light radiating. From the Star Moon Divine Spear emerged a figure wrapped in gold.

“Respect the spirit!” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang bowed, even Fu Xingxuan showed respect, following them in paying homage to the old man.

Luotian stood stunned. He hadn’t expected two spirits to have such a connection. Then he suddenly remembered the old man’s words about Master Duan Tian once catching the Star Moon Divine Spear with his bare hands.

“Amazing!” Luotian didn’t need to guess. He knew how Master Duan Tian must have been at that time. After all, the ancient clans were so powerful back then. To activate the Star Moon Divine Spear, it must have been a high-level cultivator. And it wasn’t just one; the power of Master Duan Tian alone was terrifying.

“Enough talk. Do you want to fight again?” The spirit of the Star Moon Divine Spear spoke with disdain, looking at the gray mist’s ghostly figure.

“Still so aggressive. But if it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have been activated. Maybe I would still be asleep!” The Qiankun Soul-Subduing Tower’s spirit smiled slightly, his gaze sweeping over Luotian.

“Just one human?” The gray spirit sighed softly and spoke, “I’m not here to fight with you. Since I’ve awakened, as per my master’s words, I need to find a master!”

“Master!” Hearing the spirit’s words, Luotian was stunned. His gaze fell on the towering Qiankun Soul-Subduing Tower, his heart burning with excitement.

Fu Xingyue and the others also showed excitement on their faces. They knew Master Duan Tian was a human, while they were ancient royal clan members. So the most likely candidate among them was Luotian.

“Unexpectedly, this Netherworld holds such a great opportunity. An epoch treasure!” Fu Xingyang’s face showed envy as he looked at Luotian.

“You shouldn’t be jealous. Such treasures are about fate. No one said you don’t have a chance!” The spirit of the Star Moon Divine Spear spoke softly, his tone dismissive as he looked at the gray Qiankun Soul-Subduing Tower.

“Yes!” The spirit of the Star Moon Divine Spear’s words were like a thunderclap in Fu Xingyue and others’ minds, making their eyes brighten slightly.

“Exactly! As long as there’s a connection, everyone has a chance!” The gray figure smiled, his gaze scanning over Luotian and the others.

“Then, elder, please activate it!” Luotian bowed respectfully.

“Wait a moment. I mean everyone!” The gray figure spoke again, his gaze on Luotian, making Luotian frown slightly.

“Right! Now it’s just the four of us!” Fu Xingyang shouted, his tone confused.

“Hum…” The gray Qiankun Soul-Subduing Tower emitted a series of gray mist, forming into an arrow that shot toward Luotian.

“Be careful!” Fu Xingxuan shouted, her face changing instantly. She wanted to rescue him but the arrow was too fast.

Luotian’s expression turned serious. Fu Xingxuan could feel it, so how could he not? He moved swiftly, a white light rising from his palm as he reached for the gray arrow.

Then Luotian was surprised. The arrow didn’t harm him but flew into his storage ring.

Brilliant light rose from Luotian’s storage ring, and four clumsy figures fell onto the ground before them.

“Luotian!” As soon as they appeared, a series of angry shouts echoed in Luotian’s ears, making his face turn embarrassed.

“As per my master’s intention, anyone who reaches here can enter the tower for trial!” The gray figure spoke softly, a smile on his face.

“This…” Luotian was speechless. He couldn’t understand how Master Duan Tian had thought, allowing the ancient royal clan to have a chance at his epoch treasure.

“You dare to imprison us!” Tu Feiyang shouted, his voice filled with anger. Jin Ziyang, Manhun, and Fan Jingyu also looked at Luotian with anger.

“Not killing you is already good enough. How dare you shout at me?” Luotian kicked Jin Ziyang, who was closest to him, his face cold.

“You…” Jin Ziyang felt like vomiting. He was the top prodigy of the ancient clans, but now he was being kicked around like a ball by Luotian. And this was the second time.

“Boom…” Four wisps of gray mist burst out, entering Tu Feiyang and the others. Waves of energy spread, and they were free again.

“Luotian!” As soon as they stood up, their auras soared into the sky, looking like they wanted to fight Luotian.

“Perfect. I’ll deal with you here!” Luotian’s face showed disdain, facing the four without fear. His body radiated waves of divine light.

“Don’t you dare!” Jin Ziyang’s body glowed with golden flames. He didn’t believe Luotian could win against four.

“You all stopped fighting!” The old man’s face turned cold, scolding Jin Ziyang and the others.

The old man’s voice made Jin Ziyang and the others snap out of their anger. They looked at the gray Qiankun Soul-Subduing Tower.

“Stop fighting and enter. If you fight inside, no one will stop you!” The gray spirit spoke to Luotian and the others.

“Yes!” Luotian and the others quickly replied. After all, they could temporarily hold back their fight in front of an epoch treasure.

“Creak…” The gray door slowly opened, making Luotian and the others’ faces show excitement.

“Grandpa… they’re all bad people. Don’t let them in!” As Luotian and the others took their first steps inside, a childish voice echoed in their ears. Their faces changed slightly.

“Qiankun Life-Soul Tree!” Luotian and the others’ faces changed slightly. They hadn’t expected the Qiankun Life-Soul Tree to have escaped here, but they quickly understood. The Qiankun Life-Soul Tree and the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Tower had both accompanied Master Duan Tian. Their relationship was naturally close.

“Are you trying to catch it?” Hearing the boy’s words, the gray figure’s face turned slightly cold. His gray eyes scanned Luotian and the others.

“Ah, elder, it’s a misunderstanding. We just want to communicate with it!” Fu Xingyue looked embarrassed, speaking to the gray figure.

“Ah, good. Now you can communicate!” The gray figure smiled, looking at Luotian and the others.

“Uh…” Luotian and the others exchanged glances. They hadn’t expected this spirit to say that. Then they looked at the boy standing there.

They had no doubt about the spirit’s words, but they could imagine how difficult the challenge would be. After all, before a master was found, the spirit in an epoch treasure’s space was like a god.

“Persuade me? You’re dreaming! Wait and suffer inside!” The boy looked down with disdain, then lifted his chin.

“Ah… little friend, what’s your name?” Manhun smiled with what he thought was a friendly expression and approached the boy.

“Ah… too scary! Stay away from me!” The boy saw Manhun’s strong body and kicked his legs, instantly disappearing in front of Manhun.

Manhun glared at him, wanting to grab the boy. After all, it was an immortal herb worth as much as an epoch treasure.

“Go away! You scared them!” Tu Feiyang pushed Manhun aside and approached the boy.

“Little friend, I have candy. Want to eat a few? I was wrong before!” Tu Feiyang smiled, taking out two pills. However, combined with his sharp ears and the blood clan’s fangs, as well as his whole body of blood energy, he looked sinister.

“Only you’re bad! That’s not candy. It’s my friend’s corpse!” The boy disappeared in front of Tu Feiyang again, his eyes filled with fear.

“Little friend, I have something good for you!” Fan Jingyu smiled and spread his wings. A holy aura radiated from him, giving a kind appearance with a sacred voice that entered the boy’s ears.

“You…” The boy’s eyes gradually became hazy, taking a step toward Fan Jingyu.

“Fan clan’s temptation technique! Despicable!” Jin Ziyang spoke softly, looking at Fan Jingyu. This temptation was just a small trick of the Fan clan, effective only against commoners. They hadn’t expected it to work on an immortal herb.

However, Jin Ziyang’s words had just finished when the boy regained clarity. His eyes looked at Fan Jingyu: “You’re not a good person either. But your wings’ feathers are nice. If you give me some, I’ll consider it!”

“This…” Fan Jingyu’s face turned grim. The wings of the Fan clan symbolized noble status, and if feathers were pulled out, it was difficult to recover. The last time the clans attacked humans, Fan Jingyu had been cut down and it took a lot of resources for the clan to recover.

“For the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Tower, I’ll endure!” Fan Jingyu inwardly comforted himself. His face showed a slight smile.

“How many do you want?” Fan Jingyu asked the boy, his voice kind. After all, if he lowered the difficulty, it would increase his chances of obtaining the Qiankun Soul-Subduing Tower.

“First, six feathers! If I make a dress for the lady, she’ll definitely like it!” The boy pouted, his eyes showing greed. He was clearly interested in Fan Jingyu’s wings.

“Six… six…” Fan Jingyu’s mouth twitched. He nodded, biting his teeth and pulling out his wings.

“Truly, he’s investing a lot!” Luotian and the others also twitched their mouths. They knew how important wings were for the Fan clan, as they were a strong attack method.

Light flashed. A series of white feathers radiated divine light, falling in front of the boy.

“Okay, you’ve passed!” The boy waved his hand and collected the feathers. They disappeared from Luotian’s group’s sight, with a satisfied expression on his face.

“Hiss…” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang looked at Fan Jingyu, unable to help but sneer. At that moment, Fan Jingyu’s appearance was so funny; half holy and half bald.

Chapter 1505: Watch You Deal With It

Fan Jingyu’s face was grim. He quickly folded his wings and then looked at the laughing others with a cold snort: “Laugh, but you’ll cry later. I want to see what you can do!”

“Uh…” Hearing Fan Jingyu’s words, Fu Xingyue and the others hesitated slightly. Their faces showed difficulty.

They had realized that dealing with this little thing couldn’t follow common sense; they needed to lure it and use special methods.

“Hmm…” Manhun wasn’t giving up. He bit his teeth and spoke to the boy: “Little friend, I’ll teach you my Man clan’s secret art! In the future, I guarantee you’ll grow as strong as me!”

“You? My master could hit a hundred of them with one slap! Can you make me as strong as my master?” The boy looked down with disdain, making Manhun’s face sour.

“Jin Ziyang, you also have feathers, right? You can give some too!” Fu Xingyue smiled and spoke to Jin Ziyang.

“Right! Jin Ziyang, you also have feathers!” Fu Xingyang smiled and looked at Jin Ziyang.

Hearing Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang’s words, Jin Ziyang snorted. He looked at the boy standing there and then flew up. A hot energy radiated from Fu Xingyang, accompanied by a loud crowing sound in the ears of everyone.

“Too noisy! Too noisy!” The boy heard Jin Ziyang’s call and covered his ears, shouting repeatedly.

“Huh?” However, as he looked at Jin Ziyang’s true form, a three-legged golden crow, the boy’s eyes brightened slightly.

“Where do you want it? I’ll give it to you!” Fu Xingyang’s cold voice echoed in the sky, making Luotian and others almost fall over.

“Damn it!” Fu Xingyue first gave Jin Ziyang a look of disdain. She hadn’t expected Jin Ziyang, the top prodigy of Origin Domain, to also compromise. After all, Jin Ziyang was usually seen as upright.

“Not bad at all!” Fan Jingyu’s eyes showed mockery, laughing. He felt better knowing someone else had also been mocked.

“Feathers! Feathers!” The boy jumped and pointed at Jin Ziyang’s tail, where several long feathers radiating divine laws were.

“Here you go!” A voice of gritted teeth echoed in Luotian’s group ears. Nine tail feathers fell before the boy, who collected them.

The powerful three-legged golden crow turned into a bald sparrow. It appeared before Luotian’s group, making them laugh again.

“Hum…” The humming echoed. Jin Ziyang appeared before Luotian’s group with a grim face, looking at their sneering eyes. Especially Fan Jingyu’s contemptuous gaze made him want to bury his head in the ground, since he had mocked Fan Jingyu earlier.

“It’s your turn!” Jin Ziyang spoke coldly, then turned his gaze to Luotian and the others. His eyes showed mockery, wondering how they could win the boy’s favor.

Hearing Jin Ziyang’s words, Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingyang, and Fu Xingxuan looked embarrassed. They exchanged glances.

“I’ll try!” Fu Xingxuan took a step forward and approached the boy. She smiled with an enchanting smile, then pointed her finger.

“Sister, you’re so beautiful. More beautiful than my sister!” The boy saw Fu Xingxuan’s enchanting smile and immediately changed his expression. He even walked toward Fu Xingxuan.

“Hum…” A humming sound echoed, and a purple butterfly flew out from Fu Xingxuan’s hand. It hovered before the boy, radiating a bright light.

“What’s your name?” Fu Xingxuan smiled. Though the boy was mischievous, he was also very cute and radiated a fresh aura. Fu Xingxuan’s feelings for him increased.

“I’m Xiao Qian!” The boy looked interested, extending his white hand. The purple butterfly landed on the boy’s hand and transformed into a purple flower.

“This is our Star Moon Clan’s Butterfly Love Flower. Sister, I give it to you. Let the sister enter, okay?” Fu Xingxuan smiled and spoke to Xiao Qian.
