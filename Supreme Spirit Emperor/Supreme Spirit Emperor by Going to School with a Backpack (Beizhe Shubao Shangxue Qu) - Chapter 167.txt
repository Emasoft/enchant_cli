Within the ghost beast's body, it was as if the seas were churning. Luo Tian darted through its colossal form, his nose filled with a revolting stench that made him furrow his brows. Green liquid, resembling gastric acid, poured behind him in relentless streams, chasing him relentlessly.

At the same time, Luo Tian's body transformed into a nine-colored rainbow, weaving through the ghost beast's interior. He desperately pondered how to escape the nauseating gastric fluid and find a way out of this creature's body.

He had attempted attacks before, but they yielded no results. Even his upgraded "Crack the Heavens" spear, now at the Imperial level, struggled to penetrate the ghost beast's flesh.

"Damned beast!" Luo Tian cursed under his breath, but still had no solution. He could only dash blindly forward. As he momentarily lost focus, the green gastric fluid surged behind him, and despite his haste, a few droplets splashed onto his back.

"Hisss..." A cloud of white smoke rose as Luo Tian's back felt seared, forming blisters. Intense transmutation power surged through his back.

Luo Tian had no choice but to unleash the "Fengtian Step," dodging and weaving through the ghost beast's body. His vast spiritual awareness expanded outward.

"Thankfully, I can use my spiritual senses within this beast. Otherwise, I'd be doomed to be transmuted! I never expected the inside of this creature to be more dangerous than fighting it outside!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly.

Time passed swiftly. Even though the ghost beast's body was immense, Luo Tian's speed allowed him to traverse considerable distance.

"Hmm?" After weaving through twists and turns for a quarter of an hour, Luo Tian's face lit up with hope. His spiritual senses revealed a black hole-like passage within the ghost beast, emitting faint green light. A surge of Wood Attribute Source power entered his perception.

With no other options, Luo Tian rushed toward the black hole with a hopeful mindset.

Unbeknownst to him, as he approached the passage, the ghost beast outside, which had been leisurely moving, suddenly opened all eight heads with wild eyes.

At the same time, the green gastric fluid surged forward like a towering wave, its speed increasing dramatically as it rushed toward Luo Tian.

"It doesn't want me to enter!" Luo Tian's face showed confusion, but he didn't hesitate. He unleashed his full speed, becoming a sharp arrow that plunged into the black hole.

"Buzz..." A barrier-like force blocked Luo Tian's path, but it was pitifully weak. It seemed like a piece of paper to Luo Tian and offered no resistance.

"Crash..." A stench rose behind Luo Tian, but the barrier kept it at bay.

"Fascinating!" Luo Tian smiled. He hadn't expected this barrier, which had no effect on him, to block the gastric fluid that could even corrode his domain.

Without the gastric fluid chasing him, Luo Tian sighed in relief and followed the green light to its source.

In a moment, he found where the Wood Attribute Source was emanating. A green pearl the size of a basin floated in midair, illuminating the entire black hole with its glow. The cave exuded a faint, pleasant fragrance.

Around the pearl were gray vapors connecting it like meridians, continuously channeling the source power outward.

"So concentrated Wood Attribute Source. It's enough for a Supreme Master to ascend a level after absorbing it!" Luo Tian marveled, forming a hand gesture with his right hand. A massive hand of source power materialized and grabbed the pearl, pulling it forcefully.

The gray vapors surrounding it burst apart with a "Boom," vanishing from Luo Tian's sight.

"Excellent! Though I already have the Chaos Source, this pearl would still be valuable for others to cultivate!" Luo Tian smiled and placed the green pearl into his storage ring.

"Roar..." As Luo Tian removed the green pearl, the ghost beast's eight eyes widened in fury. Its body writhed violently within the River of Death, splashing waves.

"What's happening?" The Qinglong Sect disciples and attendants on the Supreme Bridge trembled, fearing this ghost beast would leap from the River of Death and devour them like insects.

"One of its heads is shrinking!" A sharp-eyed disciple finally noticed the change, his face filled with shock.

"What's going on? Why is the ghost beast's head changing like this! Could it be..." The Qinglong Sect disciples dared not imagine further, exchanging glances before dismissing their suspicions.

"How could someone survive being eaten by a ghost beast? Impossible!" They whispered, staring at the writhing ghost beast in the River of Death. Fortunately, even without one head, the beast seemed unwilling to leave the river, giving them some reassurance.

But Luo Tian was now in another crisis. As he removed the Wood Attribute Source pearl, the barrier that had blocked the green gastric fluid vanished. The violent liquid surged forward, rushing into the black hole.

"Trouble!" Luo Tian's face darkened. His expression turned grim, a fierce look in his eyes. He formed hand gestures, expanding his domain while sending out waves of inscriptions to strengthen his nine-colored domain.

Luo Tian had no choice but to gamble everything. Trapped in this black cave with no escape, he transformed into a rainbow and charged toward the revolting green gastric fluid.

Luo Tian was gambling. He wagered that his domain would hold long enough for him to find another black hole. If he failed, he'd be transmuted by this ghost beast.

In an instant, Luo Tian collided with the green gastric fluid. The liquid struck his nine-colored domain with a "Sizzle," making him wary, but he felt a hint of relief.

"The transmutation and corrosion power has weakened!" Luo Tian thought, but he rushed forward desperately. The hissing sound echoed around him as his domain weakened.

He expanded his spiritual awareness, calculating the distance to areas without gastric fluid. He even ignited his spatial and lightning source powers, reaching his peak speed.

"Crack..." His domain finally gave out, turning into smoke that merged with the gastric fluid. Luo Tian's heart tightened. At the same time, he appeared in a vacuum area, and the green liquid slammed against his back.

"Shh..." Luo Tian gasped. His back burned with excruciating pain, and much of his flesh had been eroded by the transmutation power.

Ignoring the pain, Luo Tian lunged again. The Chaos Source surged out, beginning to repair his transmuted back.

Soon, Luo Tian returned to the state of being chased. The green ocean continued churning behind him, chasing him as he weaved through the ghost beast's body.

After another half-hour, Luo Tian finally found another black hole glowing with light. Without hesitation, he rushed in.

Seeing the soft glow of the pearl before him, his face lit up with joy.

"Time Source!" Luo Tian whispered in surprise. His eyes flashed with intensity as he gazed at the pearl, but instead of immediately taking it, he paused to think. He sat cross-legged beneath the pearl, placing one hand on it.

"Human, I'll let you out. Release the pearl!" A thought entered Luo Tian's mind as he touched the pearl, making him smile.

"Impossible. Such concentrated Time Source... I'd never let it go!" Luo Tian's voice echoed in the cave.

"Say, what must I do to give up this Time Source?" The thought returned, showing a hint of submission and exhaustion.

"Submit to me!" Luo Tian replied, but he didn't stop cultivating the Time Source pearl.

"Impossible. My master is only the Lord of the Death Domain. Your strength is too weak to challenge my master, let alone fight him outside this place!" The ghost beast roared in defiance.

"Then there's nothing to discuss!" Luo Tian ignored the ghost beast, closing his eyes to cultivate the Time Source. A smile graced his face.

"Damn... that human!" The ghost beast roared, sending thoughts into Luo Tian's mind. But Luo Tian remained as calm as a monk in meditation.

Yet, a question formed in Luo Tian's mind. This ghost beast had a master—the Lord of the Death Domain. The name alone suggested an extremely powerful entity. It was likely this ghost beast had been raised by someone.

"Whoever raises such a heavenly beast must be terrifying!" Luo Tian mused, but he stopped thinking. Now that he was still inside the ghost beast's body, it was better to focus on cultivating the Time Source and ascending to Seven-Source Supreme Master to enhance his strength.

...

Chapter 791: Seven-Source ( )

In the River of Death, the ghost beast's massive body writhed and howled. Its eight heads' eyes showed pain. The river water was stirred up by the beast, crashing against the Supreme Bridge and frightening the Qinglong Sect disciples with their fearful expressions, staring at the beast's grotesque face.

"Did Luo Tian really die? Why is this ghost beast so painful?"

"Have you noticed, its one head is also shrinking slowly!" They discussed anxiously, their faces filled with shock as they gazed at the ghost beast's head emitting soft white light.

"Master, are you still alive?" His female disciple, a cultivator, felt her heart race with excitement, praying fervently.

Luo Tian sat in the black cave, eyes closed. His hand touched the pearl emitting soft light, and a wave of transmutation power radiated from it.

Three days had passed since Luo Tian cultivated this Time Source. Though the pearl still glowed, it was dim.

Luo Tian's surroundings emitted strange fluctuations—sometimes still, sometimes fast. If anyone saw this, they'd be shocked.

Suddenly, Luo Tian opened his eyes with a joyful expression. As he did, the Time Source pearl dimmed completely, transforming into waves of time power that scattered through the black cave.

Luo Tian inhaled deeply, absorbing the concentrated Time Source into his body. His dantian echoed with a familiar thunderous sound, and a soft white light settled within it.

With the addition of the Time Source, Luo Tian now controlled seven source powers, making him immensely powerful.

Luo Tian was certain that if he met someone like Dou Jiande or Jin Yonglin, a Seven-Source Supreme Master, in a normal contest, he'd crush them. Even against Jin Yongsi or Sha Cangmang, an Eight-Source Supreme Master, he was confident he could fight back, no longer at their mercy.

"Roar..." As Luo Tian successfully cultivated the Time Source, the ghost beast roared again in the River of Death. Its roar shook heaven and earth, shaking the Supreme Bridge violently.

"The ghost beast has lost another head!" The Qinglong Sect attendants watched the changes in the ghost beast, their faces filled with shock as they gazed at its painful form.

"What's going on? In just three days, the ghost beast has lost two heads! Did Luo Tian poison it!" One disciple's mouth twitched as he stared at the six-source Supreme Master ghost beast, speaking loudly.

The ghost beast now regretted its decision. It shouldn't have swallowed Luo Tian. At that time, Luo Tian's condition was clearly injured and no match for it. Especially in the River of Death, its combat power was invincible among eight-source masters.

Regretful as it was, Luo Tian's flesh had been too tempting. It was a rare Qinglong Holy Body that appeared once every thousand years, surpassing even nine-source Supreme Masters. The ghost beast was certain that if it transmuted Luo Tian's flesh, its ninth head would grow instantly.

But it had foolishly eaten this kid, losing two source powers and its strength greatly reduced. Thinking about the time it would take to regrow those heads, the ghost beast hated Luo Tian intensely.

Luo Tian stood in the black cave, smiling. He hadn't noticed the revolting green liquid approaching. He guessed the ghost beast's strength had dropped again, and now he no longer feared its reduced transmutation power.

"Damn human! Leave, I'll let you out!" The ghost beast's thoughts entered Luo Tian's mind, making his eyes flicker with light.

"Indeed, it's afraid!" Luo Tian thought secretly. His voice echoed again from the black cave.

"Why must I leave just because you say so? I won't go today!" Luo Tian lightly touched the black cave walls, feeling their strength had weakened compared to when he first entered. He smiled coldly.

"Come on, there's so much source power in your body. Not taking it would be a waste of my trip!" Luo Tian thought, walking calmly toward the cave's exit.

The ghost beast, having lived so long and devoured countless souls, was smarter than most humans. Its remaining six eyes showed fear.

"Human, leave quickly. I'll let you out!" The ghost beast truly feared him now. One of its heads opened its mouth, sending thoughts into Luo Tian's body.

"Buzz..." A weak suction pulled Luo Tian toward the exit.

"Don't go!" Luo Tian ignored it, walking calmly through the ghost beast's body like strolling in a garden.

"My master is the Lord of the Death Domain. You won't escape my wrath!"

"Useless. I won't go!"

"My master is the Lord of the Death Domain. You won't escape my wrath!"

"Useless. I won't go!"

"One beast, one human continued to confront each other. No matter how the ghost beast tried to persuade, Luo Tian only replied with two words."

"Damn it! This is your fault!" The ghost beast roared, shaking the Qinglong Sect disciples again.

"What's wrong now?" These people had nothing to do but watch the ghost beast's changes.

In their view, the head that had opened its mouth earlier showed a sinister expression and bit into its massive body.

"Crunch..." A bite, gray vapors spread. Countless souls seemed to fly out of the ghost beast's mouth, forming grotesque faces before merging into the River of Death.

Luo Tian felt surprised in the ghost beast's body, sensing his entire space had turned black again. A wave of impact struck him, and a light hole appeared in his vision.

In an instant, Luo Tian appeared before the Qinglong Sect disciples, causing them to exclaim in surprise.

"Good heavens! What is this Luo Tian made of? Swallowed by a ghost beast, yet he's alive and has even caused the beast to lose two heads!" One disciple's face showed shock, gazing at Luo Tian standing outside the Supreme Bridge.

As soon as Luo Tian appeared in the sky, he felt a heavy pressure pressing down on him, like the will of heaven itself. It pushed him toward the River of Death.

"Regrettable!" Luo Tian's eyes showed disappointment. He didn't dare to delay, as the pressure on his body was increasing. His feet flashed with light, appearing on the Supreme Bridge.

Luo Tian's female disciple, filled with excitement, appeared before him instantly. But she forgot where her feet were—four dry arms emerged from nowhere, grabbing her ankle.

The female disciple was only a one-source Supreme Master. How could she react to an attack from a six-source Supreme Master's corpse? Though these corpses were lifeless, in an instant, her ankle was grabbed by the dry hands. A powerful tearing force spread through her body.

"Done..." The female disciple's face showed despair. Thinking about being torn apart, she was terrified.

"Still..." At the moment of despair, even her legs and arms had cracks. A voice echoed in everyone's ears, making their minds stir.

The word "Still" was spoken. A strange fluctuation rose around the female disciple, stopping her cracks. In an instant, Luo Tian appeared before her and crushed the dry hands with one foot, saving her.

"Time Source!" People saw Luo Tian's technique and shouted in surprise. They clearly felt time had stopped for a moment, allowing Luo Tian to save the female disciple.

"Thank you, Master!" The female disciple was carried out by Luo Tian. Her body pressed tightly against his, a blush on her face as she bowed respectfully.

"Ah, stay here for now. I'll check that big guy!" Luo Tian walked calmly to the edge of the Supreme Bridge, smiling as he gazed at the ghost beast with six heads in the River of Death.

"Human, you're doomed. Come down and fight!" The ghost beast's thoughts roared in Luo Tian's mind.

The ghost beast was truly furious. It had thought it had the powerful flesh, but it flew away. Not only that, it was sent out by its own mouth. Moreover, it had sacrificed a large part of its flesh to send it away. It had also lost two source heads it had cultivated with effort, a complete loss of both wife and soldiers. The ghost beast was so upset it wanted to vomit.

"Want me to come in for a stroll again?" Luo Tian smiled. Going down was impossible, of course. He had felt that once he left the Supreme Bridge, the immense pressure would compress his strength to a third. Moreover, the ghost beast's power in the River of Death was unfathomable.

The ghost beast saw Luo Tian's expression and cursed inwardly. It had just lost a massive body to get him out, but letting him in again would make it too low. However, it was helpless against Luo Tian on the Supreme Bridge. Just like if Luo Tian left the bridge, there would be pressure; if the ghost beast left the River of Death, its strength would plummet. Unless it entered the Transcendent Realm, it couldn't.

Six massive eyes stared at Luo Tian: "You wait. Wait until I enter the Transcendent Realm or my master returns, and you'll be dead!"

After saying this, the ghost beast didn't waste words. Its massive body rolled and sank into the River of Death to heal.

...

Chapter 792: City Within ( )

Seeing the ghost beast sink into the riverbed, Luo Tian's eyes showed contemplation. From their conversation, he learned this ghost beast had a master—the Lord of the Death Domain—and that it would return.

"I wonder what relationship this Lord of the Death Domain has with the one that invaded the Four Sacred Star Domains!" Luo Tian felt a cloud of doubt, sighing lightly as he walked among the people.

He waved his hand, taking out the Wood Attribute Source pearl he had retrieved from the ghost beast and handing it to the female disciple: "You should cultivate this. It should allow you to ascend to a Two-Source Supreme Master!"

The female disciple accepted the pearl, her face showing gratitude but also sensing its preciousness. She spoke softly: "Master, this is too valuable for me to accept!"

"Take it. I've dragged you into this sealed world, and it's been hard on you. This is a small compensation! For me, this pearl isn't much!" Luo Tian pushed the pearl into her arms, sighing and turning to look at the other attendants and Qinglong Sect disciples.

"Everyone, you must know why the Qinglong Sect brought you in. Yes, it was as cannon fodder! If any of you swear blood oaths to follow me from now on, I can release your soul-binding bands. Also, I promise that once we escape, I won't let you down!" Luo Tian spoke with a sincere expression toward them.

The attendants didn't hesitate, swearing blood oaths and standing before Luo Tian with respectful expressions. After all, the Qinglong Sect's oppression on attendants was too great. No one wanted to spend their life without a chance of rising up. They knew they didn't have Luo Tian's strength, but Luo Tian could release their soul-binding bands. Plus, with Luo Tian's demonstrated talent, these attendants believed he would become the next giant of the Four Sacred Star Domains.

Luo Tian didn't waste words. He flicked his hand, sending out waves of source inscriptions to free the attendants' soul-binding bands and give them freedom.

The people sighed deeply, feeling unusually relieved. Their faces showed gratitude as they bowed to Luo Tian.

"Luo Senior Brother, from now on, my life is yours!"

"Yes, thank you, Luo Senior Brother. You've given us a normal life. These soul-binding bands are too annoying!" The attendants shouted loudly, addressing Luo Tian.

"Alright everyone. You've seen it. Your current strength is still weak. After I lead you out of the Supreme Bridge, stay here and wait for me. Once I come back, we'll find a place to gather strength!" Luo Tian spoke, and purple lightning source inscriptions again emerged from his body, entering his eyes.

Seeing Luo Tian use the Purple Extreme Eye, people were delighted. On this Supreme Bridge, no one dared to move a step, fearing being torn apart by the powerful Supreme Corpses. Now that they could leave the Supreme Bridge, it was a great relief for them.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian smiled and entered the Seven-Source Supreme Master rank, again activating the Purple Extreme Eye to lead them carefully down the Supreme Bridge.

After leaving the bridge, they sighed deeply, their faces showing lingering fear as they gazed at the straight Supreme Bridge, feeling admiration.

A stone tablet stood in their view, making Luo Tian's gaze slightly tighten.

"An elder of the Qinglong Sect, I walked here to cultivate the Life and Death Source Power, entering the Nine-Source Supreme Master. This tablet is erected to commemorate this! If any descendants come, they may cultivate the Life and Death Source Power on it!" A series of characters entered Luo Tian's view.

The tablet radiated waves of Life and Death Source Power, making people's faces show excitement.

"Life and Death Source. Excellent!" Luo Tian smiled lightly, taking out some water from the Life and Death Spring in his storage ring. He gave each person a bottle.

"You should cultivate the Life and Death Source here. After cultivating, don't wander off. Wait for me here!" Luo Tian spoke, gazing at the city shrouded in gray vapors ahead.

After leaving the Supreme Bridge, a road appeared under Luo Tian's Purple Extreme Eye. The residual souls on both sides were stronger, even making Luo Tian feel a sense of alarm.

Luo Tian instructed them not to move while he transformed into a streak of light, heading toward the city ahead.

Calling it a city was an understatement. As Luo Tian delved deeper, he felt closer to the powerful residual souls comparable to nine-source masters. In his view, a massive Supertranscendent Altar appeared.

He slowed down as he entered the city, smiling with a strange look in his purple eyes.

"Unexpectedly, I met him here!" Luo Tian's feet moved, heading toward the residual soul direction of the Tianyuan Continent.

"Damned!" These annoying residual souls, Jin Yonglin's face showed a grimace. His powerful source power continuously burst from his body to counter the approaching residual souls.

Jin Yonglin had entered the city with Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian. But without the Purple Extreme Eye guiding them, they couldn't find the right path. Soon, they were separated.

While separated, Jin Yonglin wanted to see if there were other opportunities in the city. After all, the Supertranscendent Altar wasn't very useful for seven-source masters. For Sha Cangmang's group, it was more tempting. They were eight-source masters; even if they couldn't enter the Supertranscendent Realm, with the altar's supertranscendent power, they could reach nine-source.

These seven-source masters also hoped to enter the Supertranscendent Altar, but for future supertranscendent aspirations. Now they were still a distance away from supertranscendence.

Jin Yonglin decided to go alone. Moreover, the souls in this city clearly differed from those outside, as if sensing Jin Yonglin was no easy opponent and didn't provoke him.

Jin Yonglin was delighted. He had indeed found it after half a day—his hand grabbed a black soul banner, and the surrounding powerful residual souls dared not enter it, forming a vacuum.

Jin Yonglin didn't hesitate. He grabbed the banner with joy. But as he pulled it out, he met his demise.

A powerful eight-source residual soul emerged from the banner instantly and attacked Jin Yonglin. At the same time, countless residual souls rushed toward him, making Jin Yonglin suffer greatly and constantly fight them.

Jin Yonglin was no ordinary seven-source master. He matched the eight-source residual soul evenly, not falling behind at all.

"Roar..." As Jin Yonglin continuously attacked, the eight-source residual soul let out a low roar. Its voice carried a gentle tone, as if looking at Jin Yonglin's back with the care of a relative. The surrounding residual souls also showed gentleness, looking at Jin Yonglin's back, making him confused.

"What's going on?" Jin Yonglin's face showed confusion. His old eyebrows furrowed deeply, unable to figure out why the residual souls that had just attacked him stopped. But this made Jin Yonglin secretly delighted.

"It seems I've defeated these residual souls! Ha!" Jin Yonglin waved the soul banner, a wild aura rising. It even made the residual souls except for the eight-source one waver.

"Collect..." Jin Yonglin's face showed joy. He used his source power to control the soul banner, trying to collect these residual souls. With them, his strength would be a qualitative improvement. Even against an eight-source master, Jin Yonglin wouldn't fear.

"Residual souls of the Tianyuan Continent. You're not worthy of possessing them!" A cold voice echoed, and in a flash, a purple light flickered. Thunderous sounds rang in Jin Yonglin's ears. Spatial power spread, and a figure instantly appeared before Jin Yonglin.

"Luo..." Jin Yonglin's face changed. He was still thinking about how powerful he would become, but Luo Tian's figure appeared before him. Before Jin Yonglin could even say Luo Tian's name, a fist filled with lightning power struck his chest.

"Crack..." Jin Yonglin's face still showed shock. His entire chest caved in, and he became a streak of light that collided with the wall behind him.

For some reason, Jin Yonglin's seven-source body was so strong. But after colliding with the seemingly fragile wall, it didn't even ripple. Not a single dust particle fell. Jin Yonglin's entire body was flattened three inches against the wall.

"Luo Tian!" Jin Yonglin's face showed shock. He hadn't expected to meet Luo Tian again, and now he had entered the Seven-Source Master rank.

Jin Yonglin fell from the wall. His source power continuously repaired his internal organs, and his eyes showed a wild look.

"I couldn't match him when he was six-source. Now at seven-source, how can I fight!" Jin Yonglin, upon falling from the wall, grabbed a jade tablet and smashed it. At the same time, his source power surged, waving the soul banner still in his hand. A powerful source storm rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Call for help?" Luo Tian's face showed mockery. His body was filled with lightning, like a thunder god. He displayed killing intent and rushed toward Jin Yonglin's storm.

...

Chapter 793: Ascending the Altar ( )

In the Sealed Divine Continent, within the Ghost City, Luo Tian's body flashed with lightning. He appeared like a thunder god, stepping on the Fengtian Step. His body moved swiftly, instantly appearing before Jin Yonglin's storm. He punched with seven source powers forming a powerful source vortex on his fist.

The thunderous sound echoed. As the two collided, the gray vapors in the world seemed to thin slightly. With their collision, countless residual souls cried out in pain.

"Residual souls, attack this kid!" Jin Yonglin saw Luo Tian's punch disperse his attack. He waved the soul banner, his face showing a grimace and attacking Luo Tian again.

"Roar..." As the soul banner moved, countless residual souls howled and converged toward it like they were uncontrollable. They formed a massive storm that rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Defying my Tianyuan residual souls, you should die!" Luo Tian formed hand gestures. A gray mountain soared from the sky like a meteor, instantly striking Jin Yonglin.

At the same time, facing the storm of residual souls, Luo Tian didn't fight directly. His face showed cold killing intent. His feet flashed with light, dodging the storm and instantly appearing before Jin Yonglin. He punched three times: one to destroy life, two for rebirth, and three to kill gods.

Jin Yonglin's eyes showed shock. He hadn't expected Luo Tian's speed to be this fast. He took three full punches, and his wounds hadn't even healed yet.

"Crack..." His wounds collapsed again. He spat out a torrent of blood, his hands trembling. He slammed against the wall behind him again. After three punches, Jin Yonglin had severely injured his source.

Luo Tian didn't give Jin Yonglin a chance. He transformed into lightning and appeared before Jin Yonglin, raising his foot to stomp on Jin Yonglin's head.

Jin Yonglin was severely injured, but he was still a seven-source master. His overall strength surpassed Dou Jiande and others. At the moment Luo Tian raised his foot, he activated his domain to dodge it.

"Crack..." Luo Tian's foot shattered Jin Yonglin's domain, but it only blocked for a moment. This brief moment saved Jin Yonglin's life.

"Boom..." Luo Tian's foot slammed onto the ground, causing it to tremble violently. One could see how strong his power was.

Jin Yonglin grabbed the soul banner, trying to use it to support his body. At the same time, Luo Tian's hand grabbed the soul banner and shouted: "Give it to me!"

He kicked Jin Yonglin's abdomen again. The kick made Jin Yonglin feel his dantian would shatter, and he spat out blood again. His internal organs flew out of his mouth.

"Run!" Jin Yonglin was truly terrified and no longer cared about anything. He had no hope of fighting Luo Tian anymore, so he flew toward the Supertranscendent Altar with his momentum.

"Want to run!" Luo Tian grabbed the soul banner, smiling coldly. At the same time, his "Bursting Mountain" technique descended onto him.

He channeled all his strength and kicked, turning a gray mountain into a dark light. It instantly appeared behind Jin Yonglin.

"Explosion..." Luo Tian's cold voice echoed, releasing a destructive force that burst with chaos source power.

Clouds rolled, thunder rumbled. The immense destruction power rose behind Jin Yonglin, making his face extremely grim.

"Damn it!" Jin Yonglin roared. He burned seven sources, forming a torrent of power and directing it to his feet, flying toward the distance.

Even so, he was still hit by the wild wave. His back cracked repeatedly, and he turned into a bloody mess before vanishing from sight.

"Seven-source masters are truly hard to kill!" Luo Tian grabbed the soul banner, his face showing coldness. He stepped on the Fengtian Seven Steps and vanished from sight, chasing Jin Yonglin's direction.

"Damn it, big brother, Ke Zhen Tian. Why aren't you coming!" Jin Yonglin's face was pale like a sheet of paper, his body weak but still gritting his teeth. He flew toward the altar, hoping to meet Jin Yongsi and Ke Zhen Tian.
