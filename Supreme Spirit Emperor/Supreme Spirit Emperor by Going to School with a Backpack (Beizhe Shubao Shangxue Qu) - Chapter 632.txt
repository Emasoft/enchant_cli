Even so, he and Huozhu together would not be a match for this great monk. Moreover, Huozhu was still in a half-dead state.

"Artificial Spirit, do you have any way?" Luo Tian roared. He would never submit; this Demon Shell was surely a great evil.

"Sealing, only sealing!" The Artificial Spirit shouted back. This Demon Shell was essentially a part of his former master, and though he was an Artificial Spirit, he could not do anything.

"Damn it! How could I seal it!" Luo Tian cursed under his breath. At this moment, the great monk's smile had vanished; his features were twisted, and his Buddhist radiance was shrouded in dark mist. His entire body exuded a violent aura, cold and evil.

"Non-submission means death!" The voice was icy, devoid of any emotion. The great monk struck with a palm, instantly collapsing the void and slamming toward Luo Tian and Huozhu.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian shouted, hurling the Butian Stone toward the black hand. He could think of no means to withstand a True Immortal Peak's flesh.

"Traitor! I don't know how to seal!" The Butian Stone cursed, but his crimson body erupted into a massive red sphere spanning ten thousand feet. Like a meteor, it collided with the black hand.

"Boom..." The explosion echoed instantly. The Butian Stone's massive form trembled violently, and red stars on it developed numerous cracks. It flew back at a visible speed, landing upon Luo Tian's feet.

"Death by pain! I can't go on!" The Butian Stone's weak voice echoed. His crimson cracks were slowly mending.

"Lead him to the Sarira and seal it!" Though weakened, the Butian Stone transmitted mentally to Luo Tian.

"How to lead? Another strike, and I don't know how to block!" Luo Tian cursed.

"I'll help you!" The Artificial Spirit's voice echoed, his old eyes filled with madness. At this moment, Huozhu was crippled; the only one in the Zhaotian Pagoda worth mentioning was Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." After the Artificial Spirit's mad voice, an invisible wave descended upon Luo Tian's body. This was the Artificial Spirit opening his authority, and this authority for Luo Tian was an enhancement, boosting his strength.

The same went for Huozhu; Luo Tian could clearly feel Huozhu's injuries mending rapidly.

"Go!" Without hesitation, Luo Tian roared and surged upward toward the heavens because he knew the Buddha's Sarira was at the top of the Zhaotian Pagoda.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian just rose, the void trembled. Though his strength had increased significantly, he still hadn't broken through to True Immortal Mid-Stage; he was merely at the peak of True Immortal Early Stage. The terrifying wave made Luo Tian's mind quiver, leaving no will to resist.

"Poison Needles!" Seeing the Buddha's Demon Shell raise its hand, Luo Tian didn't hesitate. One hundred and eight poison needles shot from his hands, piercing the void toward the Buddha.

The great monk seemed to ignore them and struck again with a palm. Sparks flared around the monk, but those lethal poison needles could not even pierce the monk's flesh.

Luo Tian instantly felt a life-threatening crisis, watching the black hand crush down on him. He spat blood, burning his essence to push the Huangquan Step to its limit, and his speed surged again.

"Boom..." The ninety-ninth level trembled, cracking extensively. Luo Tian dodged the great monk's attack, his face pale. With his increased speed, he finally broke through the shattered heavens beyond the ninety-ninth level.

Chapter 2380: The Buddha's Sarira

Luo Tian's speed was extraordinary; he burst through the vast expanse of the sky in an instant. As he emerged, a blazing sun hovered above his head, instantly darkening Luo Tian's expression.

A golden hall, radiating authority, had a golden pearl floating at its ceiling. The pearl exuded a holy aura that suppressed the demonic energy within Luo Tian, halting his cultivation instantly.

"A fragment of world power!" The Butian Stone's excited voice echoed, laced with greed. Without hesitation, it flew from Luo Tian's body toward the golden Sarira.

"You can't escape!" As Luo Tian was stunned, the Buddha's Demon Shell also appeared in the hall. His eyes glowed red as he gazed at the golden Sarira, his expression revealing fear.

"You're already dead. Once I kill this boy, I'll absorb your Sarira and become you!" The great monk spoke softly, his voice laced with madness.

"Buzz..." The great monk struck with a palm, unleashing an overwhelming force that made Luo Tian's face grim.

"Coward! How to seal, you dare to seal!" Luo Tian cursed. This was not sealing the Demon Shell but himself.

"Stay a little longer; I'll activate my master's method!" The Artificial Spirit's voice echoed, making Luo Tian's lips twitch.

"Go to hell..." Luo Tian cursed. At this moment, his cultivation was sealed; even if it weren't, he couldn't withstand this man. He was too far behind—True Immortal Late Stage might subdue him.

"Master Butian Stone, can you hold out a little longer!" Luo Tian spoke, hoping for the Butian Stone's support but received its confirmation.

"I hold your ass; if you keep this up, no one can endure!" The Butian Stone cursed.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian grew anxious, the great monk raised his hand. Instantly, cold sweat poured from Luo Tian's forehead.

"Roar..." Suddenly, Luo Tian let out a roar, his voice echoing with the Dragon's Cry. The dragon's aura surged, roaring sky-high.

Luo Tian's throat instantly felt torn; his formidable power erupted from his mouth, echoing throughout the hall.

The hall wasn't large, yet it trembled violently. The Dragon's Cry struck the hall, producing a resounding echo that made the roar even more formidable. The sound directly pierced through the great monk's robust flesh, striking his soul.

The Buddha's Demon Body was powerful, but its soul was weak compared to a True Immortal Peak's. It was even weaker than Luo Tian's, and the great monk immediately halted his crushing hand, roaring in pain.

"Soul like a blade!" Luo Tian felt joy; he hadn't expected his newly learned sound-based martial art to be so formidable. He seemed to have discovered the great monk's weakness—the soul.

A gray soul blade shot from Luo Tian's head, radiating immense power. Simultaneously, his domain enveloped him, with ten thousand souls howling, amplifying the soul blade.

"Cut..." Luo Tian pointed his finger; the soul blade, radiating terrifying power, shot from his head toward the Buddha's Demon Shell.

The great monk's eyes flashed red, but his body radiated holy light, a stark contrast. He struck toward Luo Tian with a palm.

"Die!" Luo Tian sneered, watching the great monk dare to counter his soul blade.

"Burst..." The next moment, collision sounds echoed. Luo Tian's face suddenly turned pale, his eyes filled with disbelief.

"What happened!" Luo Tian's heart trembled; he wanted to speak but had injured his throat from using the sound-based martial art.

In his vision, the soul blade he had launched was directly shattered by the great monk's palm. It hadn't even pierced through the great monk's flesh.

"True Immortal Peak's flesh; even a soul can't penetrate it?" Luo Tian's mind shook. He watched the great monk's hand shatter his soul blade, crushing him downward.

The pressure descended, instantly destroying Luo Tian's domain and pressing upon his body. Cracking sounds rose from his chest as he was sent flying backward.

"Boom..." The golden hall trembled violently; Luo Tian's chest caved in, his mouth spewing blood like a small fountain. His body lost strength.

His soul and flesh were both wounded, nearly knocking him out. Just one strike had left him so battered.

"Master Meng... are you alright?" Luo Tian sent his spiritual sense, transmitting to Meng Wushuang who was recovering.

"Whether it's feasible or not, we must push forward!" Meng Wushuang's bitter voice echoed as he appeared beside Luo Tian. His hands moved, emitting a scorching aura. A sea of fire erupted, turning into a purple dragon that swept toward the great monk.

The purple flame was exceptionally powerful. Luo Tian, weakened and lying there, gazed at it with shock. He hadn't expected Huozhu to still possess such a formidable flame; this purple fire felt even surpassing Qixi.

"This is my life-fire!" Huozhu sighed, explaining to Luo Tian that it was a flame cultivated for years within his dantian.

"I'll help you, Master!" Luo Tian struggled to raise his hand, pressing it gently on his forehead's nine-color flame mark. Qixi's figure appeared before Luo Tian, who spat out nine colors of fire that merged with Huozhu's purple flame.

"Boom..." A sea of fire erupted, filling the hall with overwhelming energy. The terrifying temperature twisted the hall's space, even making the great monk's crimson eyes show a hint of caution. He hadn't expected Huozhu to still possess such powerful attacks, feeling threatened.

"But the monk roared again, striking with a palm. He had no cultivation, so he relied solely on his flesh.

"Boom..." The thunderous sound echoed everywhere. The golden hand clashed with the fire dragon, this time completely halting the great monk's advance. The fiery dragon shattered as well.

Huozhu spat blood, and Qixi's nine-color braid rapidly wilted, returning as a flame mark to Luo Tian's forehead.

The hall returned to calmness. Luo Tian and Huozhu gazed at the still formidable Buddha's Demon Shell, their hearts filled with despair.

The great monk smiled slightly, raising his hand again, gathering power. This palm's aura was still enough to kill Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang.

"Buzz..." As the great monk raised his hand, the Sarira hanging above their heads suddenly erupted. Ten thousand feet of radiant light rose, enveloping the hall.

"Evil creature!" A solemn voice echoed, though no one was present. Yet this voice was louder than Luo Tian's Dragon Cry.

The Dao thundered, holy light spread everywhere. In the light, a phantom appeared—identical to the great monk. The Sarira floated above the phantom's head, like a sun of all realms.

"You!" Seeing the phantom, the Demon Shell's face changed drastically; his eyes showed fear. The Demon Shell's evil thoughts made it fearless, but the only thing it feared was the Buddha's true self.

"Namo Amitabha..." The golden phantom recited softly, causing Luo Tian and Huozhu's minds to tremble. The solemn voice made even them want to kneel.

The Demon Shell was stunned; golden spiritual light flowed, forming seals that enveloped the Demon Shell. The Demon Shell's body instantly let out a painful howl.

"Leave!"

"I can only seal him for a hundred years!" The Artificial Spirit's voice echoed in Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang's minds. At the same time, an invisible wave rose on their bodies.

"Roar..." The Demon Shell howled continuously; his body emitted an aura identical to the Buddha's, beginning to resist the seal.

"Boom... Boom..." The seals began to collapse, making Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang's faces turn pale.

"Namo Amitabha!" The Demon Shell and phantom both recited, their invisible waves clashing. The Demon Shell's front emitted a deafening explosion.

"Ritual!" The Artificial Spirit's mad voice echoed, burning his own spiritual energy to maintain the seal.

Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang's eyes showed disbelief, watching the Sarira, now dimmed, burst into radiant light again. They hadn't expected the Artificial Spirit to choose to sacrifice himself, maintaining the seal's power.

"My master, Buddha's name is Namo Amitabha!" The Artificial Spirit's voice echoed in the hall. His tone carried arrogance.

The golden phantom waved his hand, and one hundred and eight beams of spiritual light rose, forming a string of golden beads. They were forcibly placed around the Demon Shell's neck, making it roar again. This time, however, it couldn't break free; its hands were pressed together in prayer.

"Now it's my turn!"

"Kid, after a hundred years, I'll give you a big gift. Don't die!" The Butian Stone's voice echoed. One could see a red mark on the Sarira—this was the Butian Stone.

"This Zhaotian Pagoda and this Demon Body will all be crushed under my control once I absorb the Sarira!" The Butian Stone's bold voice echoed, a rare moment.

"Buzz..." As the Butian Stone's words ended, Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang, along with all those who had entered the Zhaotian Pagoda, were transported by an invisible force.

"Boom... Boom..." Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang appeared outside the Zhaotian Pagoda, falling into the sand. At the same time, several figures landed beside them.

"What's going on? Did someone become the master of this Zhaotian Pagoda?" Several monks looked surprised.

"Master, catch these baldheads!" Luo Tian saw the monks and his face changed instantly, rushing to speak to Meng Wushuang.

Chapter 2381: Heading to Moxun City

"Where is Master Zhihong?" Several monks were stunned, hearing Luo Tian's words. Their faces slightly changed and they took off running.

"Buzz..." However, as soon as they moved, a scorching aura enveloped thousands of feet around them. A figure stood before them.

"Fall down..." Huozhu sneered, though he was severely wounded, he could still subdue several half-True Immortals and True Immortal Peak-level beings.

A powerful aura instantly pressed upon their bodies, making them fall to the sand and eat a few mouthfuls of it.

"Great... Great Master..." One monk spoke, gazing at Luo Tian's chest, which was caving in but healing. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to have such a background; clearly, Master Zhihong was likely dead.

"Luo Tian, are you alright?" Gu Qianxue's eyes showed concern as she approached Luo Tian. She had followed his orders and stayed put, but there was a time limit; she was soon transported out. However, she had only reached the sixties of the levels before being sent out.

"I'm fine; I just need to rest!" Luo Tian smiled lightly, watching the several monks pressed down by Huozhu's aura. He pointed his finger, and spiritual marks appeared, enveloping the monks' bodies.

"My cultivation!" The monks' faces instantly turned grim; they felt their cultivation gradually slipping from their control. Their dantians transformed into demonic seeds, and their eyes showed fear toward Luo Tian.

"Master, let's head back to Shahuai King City first!" Luo Tian looked at the Zhaotian Pagoda standing there. He could feel a connection with it, one that came from the Butian Stone. Once the Butian Stone fully devoured the Sarira, this Zhaotian Pagoda would inevitably belong to him.

"Ah!" Meng Wushuang nodded, gazing at the endless desert, but his eyes carried a hint of bitterness.

"I can't find the way!" Meng Wushuang sighed softly. Even as a True Immortal Mid-Stage, in this endless death desert, he couldn't determine where they were.

Luo Tian's face was pale; his cultivation could be activated, restoring his caved chest. With Gu Qianxue's support, he stood up and looked around. His domain expanded; after all, he had entered alone and remembered the way back.

However, upon careful observation, his face turned grim; he couldn't find the path back.

"Why is this? I clearly knew the way, but it's different now?" Luo Tian exclaimed.

"A sandstorm must have occurred!" Meng Wushuang sighed softly. Once a sandstorm happened, the entire death desert would be turned upside down.

"What do we do? How can we get out?" Luo Tian's face darkened, gazing at the monks.

"We don't know either..." The monks acknowledged their situation without hiding, answering.

"It seems we'll have to rely on experience!" Huozhu spoke softly; he had lived in the desert before, so he had some understanding of the death desert.

Luo Tian didn't object but also didn't rush to move. At this moment, both Luo Tian and Huozhu were True Immortals; in the death desert, they had some self-preservation abilities. Thus, they decided to recover their strength.

Luo Tian took out pills; his supply of pills was now limited. The Zhaotian Pagoda had been through so many dangers over the years, and his pills had consumed a terrifying amount.

Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang spent seven days recovering, regaining eight-tenths of their strength.

The cold night passed; the sun scorched the earth. Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, and they all stood up, walking toward the sun. The weakest among them was a True Immortal Peak-level being; they didn't choose to walk but flew upward, heading east.

Meng Wushuang was indeed an old veteran; under his guidance, they flew for a month. Though they hadn't exited the death desert, they found several places to replenish their cultivation, maintaining their peak state.

Another month of flying, Meng Wushuang finally led Luo Tian and others out of the death desert, appearing at the eastern gate of Shahuai King City.

"Finally out!" Luo Tian and others, covered in dust, had cracked lips. Two months of time, they encountered several dangers, even being swept up by a small sandstorm. However, Meng Wushuang relied on his experience and strength to withstand the storm, finally exiting the death desert.

"It was too hard; Master, you should never live in the death desert again. It's too scary!" Luo Tian licked his cracked lips, speaking to Meng Wushuang, who was also covered in dust.

"Ah, I won't live there anymore. Go to your place!" Meng Wushuang smiled lightly, leading Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue into Shahuai King City.

They were very ragged, even the city guards didn't recognize them. Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue were the true masters of Shahuai King City, while Luo Tian had led it to resist three sects twenty years ago.

As they entered Shahuai King City, Meng Wushuang and Luo Tian's bodies trembled, shaking off a layer of sand.

The three were only slightly better; under the special care of Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang, they had accumulated a lot of sand but looked cleaner.

They rushed directly to the King's Palace, wanting to see how Shahuai King City was now. After all, Luo Tian had been away for twenty years.

Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang expanded their domain, listening to the surrounding murmurs as they entered the Shahuai Palace.

"Hmm?" When Luo Tian and Meng Wushuang appeared in the Shahuai Palace, a figure instantly appeared at the palace's entrance.

"Senior Brother Tian!" A surprised voice echoed, it was Ye Liangchen who had promised to guard Shahuai King City.

For twenty years, Ye Liangchen had stayed in Shahuai King City except for a few times returning to Xinghe Prefecture.

"Liangchen!" Luo Tian felt touched, never expecting that a promise would make Ye Liangchen guard for nearly twenty years.

"Hard work, my brother!" Luo Tian spoke loudly, hugging Ye Liangchen, his voice filled with gratitude.

"You've become an Immortal King!" Ye Liangchen carefully examined Luo Tian, his eyes filled with joy.

"Yes! From now on, Senior Brother will take you to fly and show off!" Luo Tian laughed loudly.

"Master!" Several figures appeared, including Shao Honglang and the remaining three families.

"Hmm." Meng Wushuang nodded, now he just wanted to rest well; these years had been too hard. Even Meng Wushuang felt exhausted, not because of anything else but his energy was running out.

Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue shared a room, while Meng Wushuang naturally had his place. The three didn't say much but greeted Ye Liangchen and others, learning that Shahuai King City had no major issues. They then rested.

After washing up, Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue lay on the big bed. Luo Tian gently held Gu Qianxue, recounting his experiences over the years.

"Madam, should we rest? I've been holding it for so long!" After saying this, Luo Tian was eager.

"Exhausted as we are, can you?" Gu Qianxue's face slightly reddened; they were old spouses now. Her words had become bolder.

"Men can't say no!" Luo Tian flipped over, starting to touch her.

Three days passed quietly; in the morning light, Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, a look of satisfaction on his face. He was quite wild the first night, but for the next two days, they had been sleeping soundly.

"Ha..." Gu Qianxue slowly sat up, yawning and stretching her arms. Her perfect figure was fully visible to Luo Tian.

"You sleep a little longer; I'll go greet Liangchen, and then we can head home!" Luo Tian smiled gently, speaking to Gu Qianxue. He put on his clothes and stepped out of the room.

As soon as he left the room, Luo Tian sighed deeply and walked toward Ye Liangchen's residence.

"Senior Brother Tian!" As Luo Tian had just taken a few steps, he coincidentally met Ye Liangchen walking toward him. The two collided.

"Something wrong?" Luo Tian noticed Ye Liangchen's urgency and asked.

"Yes, it concerns Nan Gong Yuqing and Diaode Zhu. When you returned, I wanted to tell you but didn't because you were exhausted!"

"Three and a half months ago, an event shook the heavens..." Ye Liangchen spoke, recounting to Luo Tian about the incident three and a half months ago when three thousand small worlds collided with the Immortal World.

"Until now, my father and others haven't returned. A few days ago, I received news that nine Immortal Kings had dispatched half-True Immortals into it because there were no more Immortal Kings to send!" Ye Liangchen spoke, making Luo Tian's face change.

"Three thousand small worlds colliding with the Immortal World?"

"The entire Immortal World's strongest warriors have all entered another small world? No news has come out, and Nan Gong Yuqing and others were forcibly sent into the void rift?" Luo Tian couldn't help but exclaim, recalling a scene where a small world was about to collide with the nine domains. If it were true, according to time, they should have already collided.

"Several Immortal Kings, the Ten Judges of Hell, and three masters from the Mirage Sea Palace are all waiting there?" Luo Tian then thought about Ye Liangchen's words, his heart more solemn. He hadn't expected the impact of a world heart to be so great.

"Let's go!" As Luo Tian was thinking, Meng Wushuang appeared before them.

Clearly, Meng Wushuang had overheard Luo Tian and Ye Liangchen's conversation; he didn't need to listen. Now, the entire Immortal World was discussing this matter. Meng Wushuang's aura was terrifying, stronger than three days ago.

"Hmm." Luo Tian didn't refuse; a True Immortal Mid-Stage Meng Wushuang was definitely a powerful combat force.

Meng Wushuang's return was like a calming pill for Shahuai King City. For three days, Meng Wushuang's return and his True Immortal Mid-Stage strength spread throughout Shahuai King City, making no one dare to provoke them.

The three didn't hesitate; Luo Tian transmitted mentally to Gu Qianxue, explaining the situation. They then flew upward toward Moxun City.

Chapter 2382: Meeting the Eternal Immortal King

The vast sky, a rift of void hung there. Three and a half months had passed since the collision between three thousand small worlds and the Immortal World.

Three and a half months, the massive hole that had previously spanned millions of miles had disappeared significantly, leaving only several thousand feet.

Below the fissure, a dozen figures sat in meditation within the void, radiating terrifying power—these were the peak Immortal Kings of the entire Immortal World, Hell, and Mirage Sea Palace.

On the ground, few people remained; many figures flew in from afar, their auras formidable—these were the strong ones from several major Immortal Mountains.

The Ten Judges of Hell wore a mocking expression, gazing at the dark-faced Immortal Kings of Butian. They had previously been anxious but now weren't so much, as the strong ones from several major Immortal Mountains and Mirage Sea Palace hadn't emerged yet. It seemed they had encountered an unexpected situation in that small world.

Compared to the Black and White Wuchang, the strong ones from several major Immortal Mountains and Mirage Sea Palace had darker expressions. Three and a half months, almost all the strong Immortal Kings of the central three realms had been sent into the void rift. However, they seemed to have vanished without a trace like a cow entering the sea.

They had originally thought that entering a small world would be easy, with all Immortal Kings easily subduing it. After all, the highest in a small world was only the Dao Stage; they were like ants before Immortal Kings.

Moreover, that collision had meant even the Dao Stage would perish; it was uncertain if anyone remained in that small world. Those who entered could find the world heart and take it, though there might be competition. According to time, a month would suffice.

The entire central three realms had almost all Immortal Kings entering it. If something unexpected happened, it would be a major blow to the Immortal World; the central three realms would surely go into chaos.

The Hell forces were watching closely, and if they attacked the Immortal World at this moment, it would be helpless. Thus, they could only keep sending people in, drawing from the nine major Immortal Mountains into the void rift.

"Hey hey, another group came? Are you sure they all go in?" The Ten Judges of Hell mocked, arms crossed, watching the show.

"Make sure to protect your lives!" Butian Immortal King spoke to the strong ones coming from Butian Mountain, including Jiang Taibai, Jiang Yuzhe, and Zhang Ziping. Others also gave advice, even personally leaving means of protection for them.

"Make sure to protect your lives; this rift will heal in three months, and you'll be trapped inside. So within three months, you must come out!" Eternal Immortal King spoke to the strong ones from Eternal Mountain.

"Ten years... ten years later, the world heart's protection will weaken; we can then tear through the void and enter there!" Duan Baihong spoke to his subordinates. As for Mirage Sea Palace, the three masters didn't continue sending people in but still watched the void rift.

"Alright, go!" The several Immortal Kings all spoke to their disciples, this being their last hope. If these people also fell in, they would have to wait ten years before tearing through the void and entering the domain beyond.

"Buzz..." As everyone prepared to enter, three streaks of light flashed across the sky, breaking through the heavens.

"Head of Butian Mountain's Disciplinary Elder, Luo Tian pays homage to the Butian Immortal King!" A loud voice echoed in people's ears.

"Shahuai King City's Lord Meng Wushuang pays homage to the Medicine Immortal King!" As Luo Tian's words ended, Meng Wushuang's voice echoed. Shahuai King City directly belonged to the Medicine Immortal Mountain of the nine major Immortal Mountains.

"Luo Tian!" People heard Luo Tian's name and were slightly stunned, but Jiang Taibai and Jiang Yuzhe's faces showed joy. They looked at Luo Tian appearing there.

"He's not dead!" Eternal Immortal King's disciple Nie Yuantian's face turned dark, gazing at Luo Tian now in the Butian Mountain camp. He had previously thought Luo Tian was dead; when Luo Tian became an Immortal King, Nie Yuantian had thought it was a coincidence.

"Immortal King Early Stage!" Upon seeing him, Nie Yuantian's face darkened further. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to have reached the Immortal King Early Stage.

"How did he do it?" Some who knew Luo Tian were surprised, especially the Immortal Kings. They all knew that Luo Tian's name had been erased from the Sealing Monument by Heaven, not recognized.

"He!" Eternal Immortal King's eyes flickered slightly; he gazed at Luo Tian, a hint of joy fleeting. However, his sleeve's fist was tightly clenched, forcing down the urge to attack. His gaze fell on Luo Tian.

"That's Eternal Immortal King!" Jiang Taibai spoke to Luo Tian, making Luo Tian's gaze fall on Eternal Immortal King.

Luo Tian followed Jiang Taibai's gaze and saw the Eternal Immortal King standing high above, but his face showed no emotion. He locked eyes with the Eternal Immortal King.

Looking at the Eternal Immortal King, Luo Tian's body slightly paused; the Eternal Immortal King wore a smile but his eyes were like whirlpools, as if drawing infinite suction. This made Luo Tian's mind tremble; his soul quivered with it.

"Luo Tian!" As Luo Tian locked eyes with the Eternal Immortal King, a hoarse voice echoed in his ears. He regained his senses and looked at the Butian Immortal King, eyes filled with gratitude.

"He is Luo Chen!" The Ten Judges of Hell directed their gaze to Black and White Wuchang. Previously, Luo Tian had used the alias Luo Chen in the Wheel Turning Palace to participate in the Ten Judges' Grand Competition. The Ten Judges of Hell, with their strength, could clearly see that Luo Tian had concealed his true identity.

"This kid, what's he doing here?" Black and White Wuchang thought bitterly; they hadn't expected Luo Tian to suddenly appear.

"I'll explain it when I return to Hell!" Black and White Wuchang communicated with several people, while transmitting mentally to Luo Tian.

"Little bastard, what are you doing here? Previous half-True Immortals entering were all not returning. Come over and follow me back to Hell!" Black and White Wuchang transmitted mentally.

"I have no choice but to enter!" Luo Tian replied; he knew there was danger inside, and people wanting his life were also present. But Luo Tian still had to enter; Nan Gong Yuqing, Long Jie, and Diaode Zhu were all inside.

"Luo Tian!"

"Give me back my son's life!" Nie Yuantian roared, his body flying upward but not attacking Luo Tian.

"Luo Tian, my nephew's life was also taken by you!" Before Nie Yuantian's words finished, another roar echoed. Two figures from Eastern Palace stood up.

...

People were speechless watching Luo Tian; even the Butian Immortal King's lips twitched. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to have caused so much trouble.

"This kid, wherever he goes, it's never peaceful. He'll eventually play himself to death..." Black and White Wuchang sighed, watching Luo Tian while preparing to act.

"Dear young man, I felt the aura of a disciple from my Xumi Mountain on you. Please release him!" As people marveled, an old monk standing before the Butian Immortal King spoke with a gentle smile. His gaze fell on Luo Tian.

"Gasps..." Hearing the old monk's words, people inhaled sharply; even Butian Immortal King's brows furrowed slightly.

"What's going on?" Butian Immortal King looked at Luo Tian, as Xumi Mountain disciples rarely appeared. The old monk had only come out due to the collision of small worlds; otherwise, even Butian Immortal King would have difficulty meeting him.

"Who can save this kid?" People looked at Luo Tian as if he were a god, having killed two major mountain disciples and captured a Xumi Mountain disciple. This was no longer about death but about how many times he would die.

"Amitabuddha, seeing our past connection, let me beg you to forgive this kid once!" Butian Immortal King was quite troubled, speaking to the old monk but still shielding Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's eyes slightly narrowed; he hadn't expected Butian Immortal King to protect him. He had thought his main support was Black and White Wuchang.

"Amitabuddha..." Luo Tian then heard Butian Immortal King's address to the old monk, his heart slightly shaking. He didn't know how high the old monk was, but just from every monk reciting Amitabuddha, he knew the old monk was a figure of faith in Xumi Mountain.

"Of course, monks are compassionate!" Amitabuddha smiled gently, his hands clasped in prayer, gazing at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian said nothing; he waved his hand and released Zhihong and several monks.

"Buddha!" Zhihong and others saw Amitabuddha, their faces showing joy. They immediately knelt down, eyes filled with reverence.

"The matter of Xumi Mountain is settled; now it's my turn, Eternal Mountain!" Eternal Immortal King's face darkened, gazing at Luo Tian. His heart was elated; at this moment, his thoughts were on Luo Tian, even ignoring the world heart. In his view, Luo Tian was more precious than the world heart.

"Also, my Eastern Palace people were killed by him; Butian, give me an explanation!" The one in the imperial robe smiled, gazing at Butian Immortal King. He stood before Butian Immortal King alongside Eternal Immortal King.

"What are you two planning? You know I don't!" Butian Immortal King turned aggressive.

"Blood debt must be repaid!" Eternal Immortal King had previously destroyed the Dao Stage Mountain, and he was used to being strong. He took a step forward toward Butian Immortal King.

"Indeed, blood debt must be repaid!" Eastern Palace sneered, gazing at Butian Immortal King.

"What are you two up to? You know I don't!" Butian Immortal King grabbed Luo Tian and pulled him forward, though he wanted to kill Luo Tian himself. But there were reasons for him to protect Luo Tian.
