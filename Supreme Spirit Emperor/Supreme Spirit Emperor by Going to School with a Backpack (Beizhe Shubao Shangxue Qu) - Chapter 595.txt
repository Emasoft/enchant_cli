"What is this? The city defense array was like paper... If it collided with a person, even an Immortal King at the peak would be pierced!" People murmured among themselves, their gazes cautious as they watched the silver flying boat.

"Star Cloud Boat of the same level as Star River Sect! It's people from Star River Sect!"

"Could it really be that the Star River Sect has arrived? It's only been an hour, and only a Star Cloud Boat could do this!" Seeing the silver flying boat, Jiang Dao's expression immediately changed.

"Star Cloud Boats are extremely fast, capable of traversing spatial turbulence in the void!" Jiang Dao instantly thought of many things, his eyes filled with disbelief as he gazed at Luo Tian standing opposite him.

"Buzz..." As people were still in shock, a group of figures appeared within their line of sight, emitting an overwhelming pressure.

"Jiang Wuxin, what do you mean by this!" Ye Wudao stood at the forefront of the crowd, his eyes like lightning as he gazed upon Jiang Dao and the others. Ye Tao and Ye Tian stood behind Ye Wudao, their gazes equally cold. Upon seeing Luo Tian standing there, the people understood the reason and sighed inwardly at this troublemaker, but said nothing. They merely watched Jiang Wuxin and the three men.

"An Immortal King..." Jiang Dao trembled instantly, gazing at an elder behind Ye Wudao—Yeheng, who had just entered the initial stage of Immortal King.

"One Immortal King and three half-Immortal Kings..." Jiang Wuxin trembled, even Jiang Dao's heart was shaken. Their gazes carried fear as they looked up at Ye Wudao and the others, who seemed ready to fight at a moment's notice.

"Damn it, do you think our Star River Sect has no one?" Ye Liangchen cursed loudly, his voice arrogant.

"Tiān, what's going on?" Ye Wudao turned to Luo Tian, his tone slightly calmer.

"Luo Tian, how do you say it now?" Luo Tian felt a warmth in his heart as he addressed Jiang Dao, who was trembling. He also conveyed the events to Ye Wudao through mental communication.

"I..." Jiang Dao's face shifted slightly, unsure how to respond. He never expected Luo Tian could actually bring Ye Wudao and the others, and the situation had become so overwhelming it was terrifying.

"Did you dare to bully us?" Ye Wudao let out a cold snort, understanding the cause and effect. He extended his hand, a massive green hand flying out toward Jiang Wuxin.

Jiang Wuxin was immediately seized by the massive hand, lifted up and dragged before Ye Wudao. He saw Ye Wudao's cold eyes.

"Master Jiang, we are the disciples of Third Master. Do you really want to be enemies with our Third Master over this foster son?" Jiang Dao shouted, his voice filled with frustration. But he could only watch as Ye Wudao seized Jiang Wuxin, unable to fight back because the opponent was Ye Wudao, the renowned Master of Star River Sect, accompanied by its powerful disciples.

"Give it or not?" Ye Wudao ignored Jiang Dao's words and looked at Jiang Wuxin with mockery.

"I'll give it..." Jiang Wuxin trembled as he spoke. How could he defy Ye Wudao's words? He immediately took out the Supreme Heaven Seal.

"That's better!" Ye Wudao let out a cold snort, waving his hand and throwing Jiang Wuxin to the ground.

"Boom..." Dust surged as Jiang Wuxin's previous injuries hadn't healed yet. He was thrown down again by Ye Wudao, and the broken bones cracked once more. Blood spewed from his mouth as he fainted instantly.

"Now it's your turn!" Ye Wudao's gaze turned to Jiang Dao, his eyes filled with amusement.

"Ye Wudao, don't be too overbearing. We've given you one Supreme Heaven Seal. Do you want another?" Jiang Dao's face darkened. He and Ye Wudao were of the same generation, and he knew Ye Wudao's terrifying power.

"Everyone is our peer. Don't let your face be embarrassed!" Ye Wudao coldly replied, his attitude unyielding from the start, giving no one any face.

Luo Tian watched Ye Wudao's actions with admiration. The previous resentment toward Star River Sect was completely gone. Ye Wudao wasn't just helping him out, but also clearly indicating Star River Sect's stance—that they stood with Jiang Yuzhe.

Although Ye Liangchen had a good relationship with Jiang Yuzhe, Ye Wudao hadn't explicitly stated Star River Sect's position. After all, Star River Sect held a crucial role in the Supreme Heaven Sect. Ye Wudao's statement would definitely benefit Jiang Yuzhe.

If someone else, like Jiang Yu or others, were to ascend to that position, they would definitely suppress Star River Sect and consolidate their power.

"Seems like Jiang Yuzhe must become the Supreme Heaven Sect's sect leader!" Luo Tian decided in his heart, vowing to do everything possible for Jiang Yuzhe to become the junior sect leader.

"I'll give it!" Jiang Dao looked at Ye Wudao and others, though extremely reluctant, he had no choice. Not only was there Yeheng the Immortal King, but even Ye Wudao alone he couldn't fight.

Jiang Dao waved his hand and threw his Supreme Heaven Seal toward Ye Wudao, who caught it in his hands.

"Thank you, foster father!" Luo Tian bowed deeply. He hadn't expected Ye Wudao to be so furious.

"Take it!" Ye Wudao let out a light laugh, handing the token to Luo Tian's hands.

Yi Huantian's eyes glowed with joy. He hadn't expected Ye Wudao to arrive so dramatically in Huantian City.

"Luo Tian is my son. Star River Sect doesn't care about how these disciples fight, but if you hurt my son, don't blame me for turning against you!" Ye Wudao spoke boldly to Jiang Dao. His words weren't just directed at Jiang Dao but also informed the Supreme Heaven Sect.

"I understand!" Jiang Dao nodded, but he didn't plan to tell others. One reason was the shame; another was to let others also face it. As for who would kill Luo Tian, that wasn't his concern.

Chapter 2255: Entering the Upper Three Heavens

"Alright, since you know now, we won't stay long. Remember, Luo Tian is my foster son, but I treat him as my own. No one can touch him!" Ye Wudao spoke coldly, waving his hand as the silver flying boat emitted a continuous hum.

"Tiān, you did well this time. Don't carry everything alone; your foster father and Star River Sect are behind you!" Ye Wudao addressed Luo Tian.

"Yes!" Luo Tian bowed, watching as Ye Wudao and the others entered the Star Cloud Boat. The silver boat pierced through space, rushing into it.

"Foster father, this flying boat is great. Can I borrow it for a few days?" Luo Tian shouted loudly, eyeing the Star Cloud Boat with envy.

"Go to hell..."

"When you return from the Upper Three Heavens, I'll have Master Lu Chong create one for you!" Ye Wudao cursed loudly but still agreed to Luo Tian's request.

Their conversation made everyone realize how much Ye Wudao valued Luo Tian. Their gazes toward Luo Tian also changed.

"Truly, they came and left in a rush..." Luo Tian watched Ye Wudao's group depart. From their arrival to departure, it was less than a quarter of an hour, yet they had resolved the trouble.

Space trembled as the Star Cloud Boat's fluctuations disappeared from people's perception, allowing Jiang Dao and others and the city officials to sigh in relief.

"The pressure was too much. Though it was only a hundred people, their aura crushed thousands of troops. Even though the Immortal King didn't release his domain, it made me feel suffocated!" The city officials' eyes were filled with fear as they immediately started discussing.

"According to Luo Tian, Star River Sect's pillar Ye Sheng has reached the middle stage of Immortal King. The current Star River Sect is truly powerful!" People instantly felt the terrifying strength of Star River Sect.

"Damn it!" Jiang Wuxin, Jiang Dao, and Tu Tian's faces darkened. They hadn't expected to lose two Supreme Heaven Seals in an instant.

"Master Jiang, let's go!" Luo Tian was satisfied with the two Supreme Heaven Seals and addressed Jiang Huantian.

"Yes! Master Jiang, do you want to come with us?" Jiang Huantian laughed loudly, gazing at Jiang Wuxin.

"No need. I want to be alone!" Jiang Wuxin weakly replied, watching Jiang Huantian's triumphant face. He really wanted to stomp on it. But even if he wasn't injured, Jiang Wuxin couldn't fight Jiang Huantian.

Jiang Huantian and the others took a step toward the teleportation array, leaving Jiang Dao and the other three with dark expressions.

"What should we do? We lost two Supreme Heaven Seals. What now?" Jiang Wuxin's eyes showed fear. He deeply knew Jiang Yuwen's fierce nature.

"There's nothing we can do. Even if the Third Master himself came, there was no way!" Jiang Dao sighed longingly. The three of them could only accept the punishment.

"I thought this time the Ninth Master was the weakest, but it turned out to be such a guy!"

"But it's good. Among the three masters, the Third Master and Ninth Master had the worst relationship. We've also tested their strength!"

"Jiang Huantian isn't that impressive. That Sima Feiying is only at the peak of True Immortal. But this Luo Tian is tricky; even you couldn't beat him!" Jiang Dao spoke, his voice filled with concern.

"Yes. The most important thing is Ye Wudao's intention. Their strength isn't that great! As for this Luo Tian, if it really comes to a fight, I'll handle him!"

"The real test—if someone dies, Ye Wudao won't care either!" Tu Tian's face showed cruelty.

"Yes! Everything depends on what the test is. For many years, Supreme Heaven Immortal King has been elusive and hasn't appeared for a long time..."

"Rest, once we're rested, we'll enter the Upper Three Heavens!" Jiang Dao spoke softly, his eyes filled with reverence.

...

Luo Tian and the others walked along the street, followed by the Youming Eight Guardians. Sima Feiying's face showed an awkward expression and finally couldn't hold back.

"Luo Xiong, I was too harsh before. I'm really sorry!" Sima Feiying addressed Luo Tian.

"It's fine, we're all on the same side. I'll need your help in entering the Upper Three Heavens!" Luo Tian naturally didn't mind. If he did, they wouldn't be walking together now.

"Luo Tian Xiong, if there's anything you need in the future, just find me. I'll definitely help!" Sima Feiying felt touched after Luo Tian forgave him and spoke again.

With Sima Feiying's apology, the three became more familiar. Jiang Huantian also introduced the Upper Three Heavens to Luo Tian and Sima Feiying.

"The Upper Three Heavens are different from the Middle and Lower Three Heavens. The nine immortal mountains in the Upper Three Heavens are complete rulers, with no other sects. The vast Upper Three Heavens only have the power of these nine immortal mountains! Not even cities exist!"

"So, if you meet people in the Upper Three Heavens, it's likely other sect disciples. Of course, there might also be people like us who entered the Upper Three Heavens for business."

"There's another possibility: hidden strong individuals. These people find a deep mountain and dangerous place to hide. Such people rarely appear, but when they do, they are strong. These individuals are mostly those who ascended from the world!"

"Ascendants in the three thousand small worlds live for too long, most of them becoming top-level strong individuals within their world!"

Therefore, they value power very lightly and prefer to cultivate themselves and be close to nature.

Jiang Huantian's face showed admiration.

Hearing Jiang Huantian's words, Luo Tian's eyes slightly narrowed, his heart filled with anticipation. Perhaps he would meet the former masters of the Nine Domains!

"Hope to meet the elders!" Luo Tian muttered in his heart, filled with anticipation for this journey into the Upper Three Heavens.

The three walked toward the teleportation array, which rarely opened. Only those with special permissions could enter. Upon their arrival, the guards immediately noticed them.

"Master Jiang!" The guard watching the teleportation array naturally recognized Jiang Huantian, a smile appearing on his face.

Only this teleportation array leading to the Upper Three Heavens was not under Jiang Wuxin's control. It was guarded by a strength dispatched from the Supreme Heaven Sect.

"We need to go to the Upper Three Heavens!" Jiang Huantian smiled slightly, handing a jade slip to the guard.

"Wait a moment. We'll send it to the Grand Elder!" One of the guards turned and walked toward an old, dilapidated courtyard.

"The Supreme Heaven Sect has a place called the Supreme Heaven Pavilion. The elders of the Supreme Heaven Sect reside there. It's said that only those with Immortal King strength can live in the Supreme Heaven Pavilion!" Jiang Huantian addressed Luo Tian and Sima Feiying.

"The Supreme Heaven Sect is also powerful!" Luo Tian felt a slight tension in his heart, sensing the strength of the Supreme Heaven Sect. He realized he had been narrow-minded before. Initially, Luo Tian thought the nine immortal mountains were no match for the Ten Palaces of Yama. But after hearing Jiang Huantian's introduction, he no longer thought so.

"But does the Supreme Heaven Sect have its own elders? The Ten Palaces of Yama don't either?" Luo Tian's mind was puzzled. He had been a prince in the Wheel Turning Palace but hadn't heard of any elders from Yama and Hades.

"Master Jiang, please come in. The Grand Elder has agreed!" The guard quickly returned and led Luo Tian and the others toward the old, dilapidated courtyard.

Upon entering the courtyard, a wave of fluctuations enveloped Luo Tian and the others. The ground was filled with divine laws.

"Go up, Master Jiang. We'll open the teleportation array for you!" The guard addressed Luo Tian and the others.

Luo Tian's eyebrows slightly furrowed, gazing at the divine laws flowing on the ground. He felt a sense of danger, but it wasn't strong. He sighed, realizing his long-standing issue with teleportation arrays hadn't changed.

Jiang Huantian and Sima Feiying stepped onto the teleportation array. Luo Tian had no choice but to take it, as he needed to enter the Upper Three Heavens.

"Buzz..." The teleportation array opened, and waves of space fluctuated, affecting Luo Tian's body. His body disappeared from the courtyard.

"Second Master, I've helped you out. This favor is repaid!" A long sigh echoed in people's rooms, but the two guards seemed to have not heard it.

The feeling of spinning and turning invaded Luo Tian, making him苦笑. Every time he took a teleportation array, he felt no safety and his mind was unsteady. He had also summarized that over the years, taking teleportation arrays often led to problems. Only three times out of ten was he safe. Especially with Wan Lingkong, who often sent them to the dead end.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian was lost in thought, a loud noise suddenly echoed in his ears. He felt his body constantly shaking and a sensation of being cut by knives.

"Something's wrong, right?" Luo Tian instantly felt something was off. But during the teleportation process, he couldn't stop it.

"Ah..." Intense pain spread throughout Luo Tian's body. He felt as if he were being flayed alive.

Just as Luo Tian was about to faint, the teleportation ended. Luo Tian, Jiang Huantian, and Sima Feiying appeared under a vast sky.

"Rippling..." The sound of water waves spread, allowing Luo Tian to regain a bit of clarity.

"What's going on!" Luo Tian opened his eyes, looking at his bloodied body and seeing Jiang Huantian and Sima Feiying falling continuously.

"Plump... Plump..." Three sounds of splashing into water echoed, a cold feeling instantly making Luo Tian fully regain his clarity. He moved his hands and surfaced from the water.

Jiang Huantian and Sima Feiying also appeared beside Luo Tian. At that moment, the three were extremely disheveled, their bodies covered in blood and several deep wounds.

"I swear I'll never take a teleportation array again!" Luo Tian shouted in his heart, the waves凝聚 on his body.

"Big brother, I was just playing around..." Luo Tian felt the vow's validity and couldn't help but shout.

"Rippling..." As Luo Tian spoke, he also saw the surrounding scenery and felt a tightness in his heart.

Chapter 2256: Dead Sea

The gray sea, like a mirror, stretched endlessly without any signs of life. The sky above was a clear blue, but the sea exuded an eerie silence, making Luo Tian and others' faces change slightly.

"Where are we?"

"This teleportation array should have taken us to the only city in the Upper Three Heavens, Jiutian City, right?" Sima Feiying's gaze was filled with concern as he looked at the gray sea.

The gray sea also flowed with blood that had just dripped from them. The Youming Eight Guardians' faces were grim, surrounding Luo Tian carefully and watching the surroundings.

"Why is this sea gray? Where should we go?" Luo Tian was also very cautious, gazing at Jiang Huantian, the only one who knew something about the Upper Three Heavens.

"Is this the Dead Sea..." Jiang Huantian couldn't help but speak, gazing at the endless gray ocean.

"Dead Sea?" Hearing Jiang Huantian's words, Sima Feiying and the Youming Eight Guardians' faces changed. Only Luo Tian looked puzzled, but he knew this name wasn't a good place.

"The Dead Sea is a famous forbidden area in the Upper Three Heavens. If you look from outside, it seems small, but once you enter the Dead Sea, it stretches endlessly. No one has ever left the Dead Sea..." Jiang Huantian spoke, his voice filled with bitterness.

"Can't be... I swear..." Luo Tian couldn't help but curse, sighing that the teleportation array was truly not safe.

"Did the Grand Elder do this on purpose?" Sima Feiying's face darkened. This situation clearly indicated the teleportation array had a problem.

"How to get out..."

"How can we get out? Without an Immortal King, we can't escape from this Dead Sea!" Jiang Huantian's face darkened. Even he was a bit confused now.

While the three were talking, the gray sea gradually changed color. A wave of black mist drifted out from the sea, spreading a foul smell throughout the world.

"Swish... Swish..." A cloud of black mist approached Luo Tian and others, making their faces change drastically. A sense of death immediately invaded them.

"Damn it..." At this moment, if Luo Tian didn't guess that the bastard Grand Elder had tampered with it, he would have lived in vain.

"What is this thing? Is it a fish?" Sima Feiying looked at the black cloud that was only ten thousand zhang away and asked Luo Tian.

"Devouring Immortal Fish..."

"Quickly fly to a higher place!" Jiang Huantian, after carefully observing, turned pale and flew up, dragging his wounded body toward the sky.

"What?" Luo Tian's face also changed. He had seen an introduction of Devouring Immortal Fish in the Classic of Mountains and Seas. Immediately, he flew up.

Devouring Immortal Fish are group-living fierce beasts but are dominant species. Any living creature with blood and flesh can be devoured by them.

In an instant, Luo Tian and the others flew up to ten thousand zhang high. They saw the black cloud moving toward their previous position, allowing them to see the full appearance of the Devouring Immortal Fish.

Numerous small black fish swam continuously, each about palm-sized. Their black scales emitted a faint glow, but their rows of teeth glowed with cold light.

Numerous black Devouring Immortal Fish were densely packed, layer upon layer. Luo Tian's scalp tingled; he didn't believe that if he fell into this school of fish, there would be no chance of survival. He felt like he'd be eaten to the bone in an instant.

As Luo Tian was expressing his admiration, those black Devouring Immortal Fish suddenly jumped into the air and rushed toward Luo Tian and others.

"My god..." The three couldn't help but gasp, instinctively flying upward again.

"Rippling..." Black waves surged, a wave of Devouring Immortal Fish rushing toward Luo Tian and others.

"Ten zhang... Thousand zhang... Ten thousand zhang..." In an instant, the Devouring Immortal Fish jumped up to ten thousand zhang high and continued to grow.

"Run quickly..." Jiang Huantian's face changed. Although they could kill many of them, the number of Devouring Immortal Fish was too large. They were overwhelming.

Luo Tian and the others flew upward again, but the Youming Eight Guardians' Gui Qi was slightly slower. A Devouring Immortal Fish bit his leg.

"Crack..." Large pieces of flesh immediately flowed from Gui Qi's leg. The Devouring Immortal Fish was still biting his thigh.

"Get out of here..." Gui Qi growled, the green sickle emitting a cold glow. The cold light slashed against the black Devouring Immortal Fish.

The Devouring Immortal Fish was instantly cut in two, but the head still bit Gui Qi's thigh. At that moment, more Devouring Immortal Fish caught up with Gui Qi, making his face look grim.

"Rippling..." A sea of fire enveloped Gui Qi, annihilating many Devouring Immortal Fish and bringing Gui Qi back to the group. Gui Qi took a long breath.

"Thank you, Master!" Gui Qi addressed Luo Tian, pulling the Devouring Immortal Fish off his leg. He also took a piece of flesh from Gui Qi's thigh, but Gui Qi only turned pale and showed no other expression.

The group continued to fly upward. However, the Devouring Immortal Fish also continuously ascended and chased after Luo Tian and others.

"Fly in a different direction..." Jiang Huantian's face changed. They had no other choice but to run.

"Stay together, don't get separated!" Luo Tian addressed the group and flew in a direction. Jiang Huantian, Sima Feiying, and the Youming Eight Guardians also followed Luo Tian's direction.

"Rippling..." The Devouring Immortal Fish formed a wave of black waves, chasing after Luo Tian and others. Their speed was extremely fast.

Time passed. Luo Tian and the group flew for nearly an hour without finding a direction, like a headless fly, darting around.

"Let's fly in one direction..." Jiang Huantian's face darkened, addressing the group. They had no good methods at this moment.

This time, they flew in one direction. The black waves still chased after Luo Tian and others. If the group slowed down even slightly, they would be devoured by the countless Devouring Immortal Fish.

"If there was an Immortal King who could unleash a domain, these Devouring Immortal Fish would be nothing!" Luo Tian sighed. An Immortal King's domain was definitely an extremely powerful thing.

Although Luo Tian had the Heavenly Human Dao Method, both its range and power were far behind a domain.

After flying for two more hours, the group's injuries had not healed yet. Plus, this desperate flight was exhausting. They couldn't fly indefinitely.

"Kid, you're lucky to have come to the Dead Sea!" The voice of the Supreme Heaven Stone echoed in Luo Tian's mind.

"Did you know? Do you know how to get out?" Luo Tian's face instantly lit up. At this moment, he didn't care about the Supreme Heaven Stone changing his name again. He communicated with it mentally.

The Youming Eight Guardians were about to give up, and if they didn't find a way out soon, the Youming Eight Guardians might die here. This wasn't what Luo Tian wanted to see.

"The Dead Sea is a dead zone condensed by the great forces of heaven and earth. Not only you, even an Immortal King would find it very difficult to escape. Unless it's someone like Yama and Hades at the peak, who could push their way out." The Supreme Heaven Stone communicated with Luo Tian mentally.

"Stop talking nonsense. Let's talk about the real thing!" Luo Tian interrupted the Supreme Heaven Stone, knowing if he let it continue talking, it might go on and on about boasting.

"The Dead Sea's center must have a spring. Find the position of the spring and go in, holding up the pressure to escape."

"This place can be understood as a spatial fracture. Once you break through the spatial fracture, you can escape the Dead Sea. That spring is both the exit and entrance. As for where it appears, I don't know!" The Supreme Heaven Stone quickly spoke.

"Also, the Dead Sea has demons. It's not just these Devouring Immortal Fish; there are other fierce beasts and monsters too. Be careful, Master!" Before Luo Tian could speak, the Supreme Heaven Stone added another sentence.

"Grand Elder, when I become an Immortal King, I'll be the first to take you down!" Luo Tian cursed in his heart but continued communicating with the Supreme Heaven Stone.

"I can't distinguish north, south, east, or west. How do I find the center spring?" Luo Tian asked, grabbing Gui Liu who was barely holding on.

The Youming Eight Guardians showed a sense of guilt. Although Luo Tian had accepted them, since they followed him, they hadn't truly helped Luo Tian much. It was always Luo Tian fighting alone.

"Don't say those useless things. First, escape is important!" Luo Tian scolded the group, which was the first time he had ever scolded them.

"I know how to find the spring!" The Supreme Heaven Stone's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, making his face light up.

"Follow me!" Luo Tian addressed Jiang Huantian and Sima Feiying, then moved quickly in the direction indicated by the Supreme Heaven Stone. Jiang Huantian and Sima Feiying, seeing Luo Tian's certainty, blinked their eyes slightly and followed behind him.

Thus, one chasing and the other fleeing. Another hour passed as the sky gradually became dark.

"Have you noticed that the Devouring Immortal Fish behind us are getting fewer?" Luo Tian's face showed confusion as he addressed Jiang Huantian and others.

"Yes, it's getting fewer!" Sima Feiying panted heavily, his brows furrowed.

"Have we left the domain of the Devouring Immortal Fish?" Luo Tian wondered, knowing that fierce beasts had strong territorial awareness.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian was confused, the Devouring Immortal Fish that had chased them for several hours suddenly turned around and stopped chasing. At the same time, a powerful suction force immediately descended, attracting those Devouring Immortal Fish that hadn't escaped yet.

"What is this..." Sima Feiying's eyes turned yellow, gazing at the distance with shock.

Gray waves surged, and a large amount of gray sea water rushed toward a gray whirlpool. The suction force also affected Luo Tian and the others.

Chapter 2257: Kunpeng

A powerful suction force swallowed the heavens and earth, a massive black mouth opening. A large amount of dead sea water and countless Devouring Immortal Fish began to rush toward the black mouth. Gray whirlpools appeared in Luo Tian's group's line of sight, and the powerful suction force also affected them.

With a massive body like a ten thousand zhang mountain, Kunpeng soared from the dead sea water. A powerful pressure made Luo Tian's group's faces change drastically.

"This is a divine beast, Kunpeng!" Jiang Huantian's face turned pale as he resisted the powerful suction force and gazed at this massive creature.

"Kunpeng!" Luo Tian's eyes also slightly narrowed, gazing at the massive creature devouring Devouring Immortal Fish.

"This is Master Xiang Tianming!" Luo Tian instantly recognized this Kunpeng, who was the former master of the North Sea on the Tianyuan Continent.

"Roar..." The massive Kunpeng soared out of the water, emitting a low roar. An invisible wave enveloped an area of ten thousand miles.

Its gray eyes gazed at Luo Tian's group. When the gaze swept over them, the gray eyes showed confusion but still let out a low roar. The suction force became even stronger, making Luo Tian's group feel they couldn't hold on.

"This is a Kunpeng comparable to an Immortal King. We are doomed!" Jiang Huantian shouted, his voice filled with despair.

"Master Xiang Tianming!" Luo Tian shouted. His clothes fluttered as his body was uncontrollably pulled toward the Kunpeng's mouth.

"Why has it become like this!" Luo Tian looked at the gray mist in the Kunpeng's eyes, feeling confused. At the same time, he formed a hand seal and used the Heavenly Human Dao Method to envelop everyone.

"This is..." Jiang Huantian and Sima Feiying's minds were shaken. They had just been about to give up, but now they felt the suction force had lessened significantly. Clearly, it was because of Luo Tian.

"Surely something went wrong. Master Xiang Tianming wouldn't recognize me!" Luo Tian looked at the massive Kunpeng, thinking to himself.

"Do you know this Kunpeng?" Jiang Huantian and Sima Feiying looked at Luo Tian, whose face was dark. If Luo Tian knew this Kunpeng, there might be a chance of survival.

"I do know it. But he doesn't recognize me!" Luo Tian confirmed that this Kunpeng was definitely Xiang Tianming, because on his body's wings there was a scar.

"He seems to have been corrupted by something!" Luo Tian felt that Xiang Tianming's soul was different, his eyes filled with contemplation.

"I need to check!" Luo Tian's eyes sparkled. He couldn't watch Xiang Tianming like this without his soul.

"Go!" Jiang Huantian addressed Luo Tian. At this moment, they couldn't hold on for long. If Luo Tian knew the Kunpeng and could help it recover, that was their only chance.

Luo Tian reinforced the Heavenly Human Dao Method again and flew up toward the black whirlpool.

The Yellow River Step was activated, combined with the powerful suction force. Luo Tian instantly reached the Kunpeng's mouth without hesitation and flew into it, as if he had been swallowed.

"See if he can come out. If he can, we still have hope. If he doesn't come out, we'll also go in!" Jiang Huantian sighed softly, watching Luo Tian disappear from their sight.

"Rippling..." Luo Tian followed the powerful dead sea water into the Kunpeng's body. In the darkness, it didn't affect Luo Tian's vision. As soon as he entered the Kunpeng's mouth, he didn't rush around but searched for the Kunpeng's soul sea. That was where Xiang Tianming's soul resided, and the problem must be there.

Although Luo Tian's intention was good, entering a fierce beast's stomach wasn't safe. Otherwise, the Devouring Immortal Fish wouldn't be so afraid.

As Luo Tian was about to turn and head toward the Kunpeng's soul sea, a force that couldn't be resisted immediately acted on him. It felt like an invisible hand grabbing and pulling him in a direction, rushing toward the dead sea water.

"Supreme Heaven Stone!" Luo Tian waved his hand, and a red stone appeared in his hands. An invisible wave acted on him, making him instantly land on the red earth.

"Master... your courage is truly great!" The Supreme Heaven Stone's voice was filled with solemnity, emitting a red glow to counter the wave. However, Luo Tian was too late; the red stone flowed quickly and instantly arrived at a vast space.

"Gurgle..." Gray liquid continuously stirred, and Devouring Immortal Fish fell into the gray liquid. In an instant, they turned into black smoke and disappeared from Luo Tian's sight.

Finally, when the Supreme Heaven Stone was about to fall into the gray liquid, it stopped. Luo Tian wiped his forehead's cold sweat. If it had truly fallen in, the Supreme Heaven Stone would be fine, but he would definitely be reduced to bones.

"Be nicer to me in the future!" The Supreme Heaven Stone's voice was slightly tired, obviously finding it difficult to resist that force.

"Sure, sure!" Luo Tian quickly replied. The Supreme Heaven Stone had saved his life more than once, and he naturally wouldn't mistreat it.

"Let's go. Let's check his soul sea!" Luo Tian addressed the Supreme Heaven Stone, and the red stone flew out of the Kunpeng's stomach. It roamed within the massive body.

The Supreme Heaven Stone was indeed a rare treasure of heaven and earth. It quickly found Xiang Tianming's soul sea. If it were Luo Tian himself, he might have searched for a long time.

In the gray space, waves of gray water rippled. Above the soul sea was a figure seated in meditation, wrapped with eight gray chains. Gray mist drifted around the figure's body. The gray figure was Xiang Tianming's appearance.

Luo Tian flew out from the Supreme Heaven Stone, gazing at Xiang Tianming. His eyes showed seriousness. As a soul master, he naturally felt Xiang Tianming's weakened soul. The gray chains seemed to constantly draw out Xiang Tianming's soul power.

Luo Tian moved his body and waved his hands. A gray soul knife flew out from above his head, slicing toward the gray chains.

"Crack..." A crisp sound echoed. The soul knife, which was invincible, didn't cut through the gray chains but instead was repelled. However, it did loosen the chains slightly, making Xiang Tianming open his eyes.

"Luo... Tian..." Xiang Tianming opened his eyes, gazing at the soul knife Luo Tian had just reactivated. His eyes showed a hint of joy, and he spoke weakly.

"Master Xiang, what's going on?" Luo Tian asked. He reactivated the soul knife and sliced toward the chains.

"Run away quickly!" Xiang Tianming spoke, his voice weak. He didn't know how Luo Tian had arrived here but knew what situation he was in.

When the initial immortal path collapsed, Xiang Tianming fell into the Dead Sea and became his body. He discovered he could absorb energy from the Dead Sea to cultivate, and devouring creatures in the Dead Sea could also enhance his cultivation. However, over time, Xiang Tianming found his mind becoming increasingly hazy until he felt stronger and stronger. His golden soul sea turned gray, and eight chains emerged from the soul sea, wrapping his soul and beginning to draw out his soul power.
