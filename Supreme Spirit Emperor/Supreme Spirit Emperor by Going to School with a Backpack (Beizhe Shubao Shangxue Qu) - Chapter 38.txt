“Boom……” A young man’s lifeless body fell to the ground.

“Good!” The Black Yin Sect erupted in cheers.

Meanwhile, the Five Elements Sect exuded a bleak atmosphere. The sect’s disciples gazed at the bloodied young man standing atop the arena, a sense of helplessness stirring within them.

The youth was drenched in blood—his sect’s, his peak’s most promising genius.

Of the ten men summoned by Wei Mingxuan, only four remained besides Luo Tian: Zhang Hongyun’s face was grim as he stared at Gao Jie atop the arena, knowing he could not match this youth and hesitating to act.

Yang Huanyu remained impassive, standing there as if none of it concerned him.

The remaining disciple was from the Earth Peak.

“Gao Jie’s a bit too bloodthirsty, but with his cultivation, he could’ve easily become the next sect leader!” Du Yongchang mused inwardly.

Wei Mingxuan’s face was dark as he watched his sect’s geniuses perish one by one on the arena. His heart felt like it was being torn apart.

“Who’s next?” Gao Jie spoke coldly, his face stained with blood, yet an unending arrogance radiated from him.

Silence. From the elders to the disciples of the Five Elements Sect, all remained silent. The consecutive defeats had sapped their willpower; Gao Jie’s image was now invincible in their eyes.

“I’ll fight you!” Zhang Hongyun knew retreat was no longer an option, his voice low and fierce.

Yet after Zhang’s cry, the Five Elements Sect disciples remained silent. None had faith in Zhang Hongyun; the previous challengers had been no match for Gao Jie, reduced to playthings without a fight. They could not fathom who among them could defeat this demon-like youth.

Zhang Hongyun let out a bitter laugh, rising to the arena’s edge and pushing off with his feet, attempting to leap onto the stage.

At the moment Zhang’s body launched upward, a firm hand yanked him down. A cold voice echoed in the crowd: “Let me do it.”

Chapter 181: Battle Against Gao Jie

Zhang Hongyun felt the powerful hand on his body and turned to see a familiar figure standing before him, eyes calm.

“Luo Tian!” Zhang Hongyun’s heart warmed; he knew Luo Tian had stepped up to protect him. If he couldn’t see this, he wasn’t worthy of being a genius.

Though Zhang knew Luo Tian was strong, he doubted whether the latter could best Gao Jie. He stood there, uncertain.

“Luo Tian!” The disciples of the Five Elements Sect, whose eyes had been numb, now glimmered with hope. Luo Tian’s name, long renowned within the sect, had ignited a flicker of optimism in their hearts.

Wei Mingxuan’s face softened; he was reassured by the Dantian faction of Zhang Ziping.

Other peak masters and elders wore expressions of guilt, as did all the disciples, who lowered their heads in shame.

Previously, they had harbored resentment toward Luo Tian, as the events stemmed from him. But after Gao Jie’s consecutive victories—killing and defeating several peak disciples—their desire for someone to crush this arrogant youth had grown desperate, yearning to erase the humiliation.

Luo Tian also felt resentment toward the other peaks’ disciples, though he had caused the trouble. They shouldn’t have dragged Dantian into it; that was why he hadn’t acted before.

But seeing Zhang Hongyun about to fight, and knowing their bond, Luo Tian realized Zhang wasn’t Gao Jie’s match. He couldn’t let Zhang die.

“Finally, you showed up!” Gao Jie smirked as he saw Luo Tian below the arena.

“Haha, kid, you had to come eventually. Why let so many from the Five Elements Sect die?” Du Yongchang sneered.

The remaining youth of the Black Yin Sect, seeing Luo Tian step forward, wore a smile, watching Luo Tian with interest.

At the Five Elements Sect’s side, only two remained from the Earth Peak. Yang Huanyu still wore a neutral expression, but his closed eyes slowly opened, murmuring: “Are you the one I’ve been searching for?”

“Luo Tian, fight!” Someone shouted, reigniting the previously lifeless atmosphere. Cheers erupted from the crowd; Luo Tian had become their last hope. If he lost, the Five Elements Sect’s younger generation would be utterly humiliated.

Luo Tian ignored the cheers, leaping onto the arena with a smile: “Five Elements Sect, Dantian, Luo Tian. Please teach me!”

“You’re the one who killed Wang Siyuan?” Unlike others, Gao Jie asked softly.

“Yes, he was my kill!” Luo Tian admitted.

“I should thank you for killing that waste who relied on his ancestor in the Black Yin Sect. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have had a chance to become the next sect leader. To show my gratitude, I’ll let you die swiftly!” Gao Jie clenched his fists, excitement in his eyes.

Luo Tian’s name was now infamous within the Black Yin Sect; the sect’s elders had decreed that whoever killed Luo Tian would receive immense rewards.

Gao Jie thought about killing Luo Tian and reaping the elders’ rewards, but it wasn’t enticing. However, this battle would prove his worth to the elders, securing his position as sect leader. To achieve all that, he first had to kill this seemingly frail youth.

“Don’t thank me; you won’t be the next sect leader, for you’ll soon meet Wang Siyuan!” Luo Tian ignored Gao Jie’s words, replying with a cold smile. Yet his eyes held an icy killing intent.

“Die!” Gao Jie sneered, vanishing again, using the same method he’d employed to kill his opponents.

“My techniques won’t work against you!” Luo Tian mocked, his spiritual sense spreading to locate Gao Jie. A fist filled with invisible energy smashed into Gao Jie’s chest.

“Boom……” a dull sound echoed.

Gao Jie reappeared, his face filled with disbelief—how could Luo Tian have found him?

Then he felt a searing heat in his chest, as if struck by something. He spat blood and was sent flying.

“Hiss……” gasps of shock rippled through the crowd.

The Five Elements Sect disciples stared in awe at Luo Tian, who stood calm. The once-proud Gao Jie was now battered and humiliated.

“Five-Element Constitution! Truly formidable!” Du Yongchang recognized Luo Tian’s abnormal trait, his eyes flashing with a fierce killing intent.

The Five Elements Sect elders and peak masters were equally stunned; they knew Luo Tian was strong, but not this strong. Gao Jie—this genius who had killed their peak disciples in mere moves—was now sent flying by Luo Tian’s single punch.

“His strength has increased significantly!” Feng Qianyu, who had taken pills and recovered, sighed.

“Yes, I feel like he’s pulling away from me,” Zhang Hongyun said with a bitter smile, the familiar helplessness returning.

“This is what they call Luo Tian? He’s got skills! I guess I’ll have to step in today!” The young man behind Du Yongchang spoke softly, his body radiating a fierce battle spirit.

“You’ve angered me! Truly! Luo Tian! I take back my words—I’ll make you suffer!” Gao Jie wiped his lips, snarling before vanishing again.

“Idiot! I’ve seen through your bone-fragmentation techniques, yet you dare use them before me!” Luo Tian sneered.

Though Gao Jie’s speed was fast, beyond the eyes’ perception, it still lagged behind Luo Tian’s spiritual sense at its peak.

Luo Tian strode forward, lifting his leg high and stomping down with a force that seemed to shatter the arena.

To some body-refinement disciples, Luo Tian’s foot appeared to land in midair.

But the Black Yin Sect’s elites turned pale, shouting: “Gao Jie! Be careful!”

Chapter 182: Heart-Refining Dagger

“Too late!” Luo Tian smirked.

“Boom……” Gao Jie’s body fell again onto the arena, and beneath him, cracks splintered across the stage.

“What cultivation level is your spiritual sense?”

Gao Jie slowly rose, his face filled with disbelief. He had pushed his speed to its limit; he was certain even a bone-fragmentation elder wouldn’t detect him. Yet Luo Tian had found him.

“Oh, I almost forgot—actually, I’m also a cultivator!” Luo Tian clenched his fists, a playful smirk on his face.

“Damn it!” Gao Jie cursed.

But before he could finish, his eyes were stung by a blinding white light. Distracted for a moment, he was met with a storm of attacks.

Every time Luo Tian’s fist fell, the Five Elements Sect disciples erupted in cheers, releasing their accumulated pressure.

“Boom……” Luo Tian’s foot slammed onto Gao Jie’s back, his face cold and terrifying.

“How does it feel to be abused?” Luo Tian asked.

“Ah…… I’ll kill you, Luo Tian!” Gao Jie went mad, pushing against the ground with both hands to shove Luo Tian’s foot off his back. He leaped far away.

How could Gao Jie endure such humiliation? For years, he had been the one on top, crushing others beneath him. This was his first time being trampled—how could he accept it?

“Crack!” Gao Jie’s hand held a dark blade.

Luo Tian knew most Black Yin Sect disciples used blades, but he could clearly sense this one was far stronger than the one Shi Yongfeng had wielded. It surpassed even a high-grade yellow-tier weapon.

Gao Jie sliced his hand with the blade, and a streak of blood appeared on it.

A strange scene unfolded: the blade seemed alive, emitting a desire for more blood, absorbing Gao Jie’s.

“Have your fill! Now do my bidding!” Gao Jie’s face twisted with grimace and pallor; the blood he’d fed the blade wasn’t ordinary—it was his essence.

At the moment the blade absorbed Gao Jie’s blood, Luo Tian felt a surge of danger. He couldn’t afford to be careless; his face turned serious, and the Rending Sky Spear materialized in his hand.

“Unexpectedly, Gao Jie has earned the Heart-Refining Blade’s approval!” Du Yongchang’s face lit up with joy.

“Heart-Refining Blade” was a renowned weapon in the Black Yin Sect, classified as high-grade yellow-tier but actually worth an abyss-tier. If it weren’t for its short length, it could be considered a low-grade abyss-tier weapon.

Unlike other yellow-tier weapons, Heart-Refining Blade possessed its own consciousness.

Holding the blade, Gao Jie seemed transformed into a reaper, his body becoming a blur as he attacked Luo Tian.

“Golden Snake Wild Dance!” Luo Tian roared, knowing now was not the time to be careless. He had already defeated a bone-fragmentation elder; Gao Jie was no match for him.

Though Gao Jie claimed he could assassinate bone-fragmentation elders and injure them, Luo Tian had actually killed one. However, he was slightly wary of the blade’s strange nature; if it weren’t for that, he wouldn’t have even drawn his spear.

A flurry of spear attacks forced Gao Jie into a desperate position, but as an elite disciple of the Black Yin Sect, he escaped through his agility. The Heart-Refining Blade glowed with a sinister red light, like a bloodthirsty beast opening its maw. It slashed across Luo Tian’s arm, leaving a shallow wound.

Luo Tian’s face changed; the moment the blade touched his arm, he felt a drop of his essence leave his body.

“Buzz……”

A piercing hum echoed from Gao Jie’s blade.

Red light radiated from the weapon, and a strong desire surged from the Heart-Refining Blade into Gao Jie’s mind. If he hadn’t restrained it, the blade might have flown out on its own.

Gao Jie smiled greedily at his Heart-Refining Blade, eyes filled with lust as he gazed at Luo Tian: “I didn’t expect your essence to contain so much vitality. If I drain all of it, my blade might reach abyss-tier!”

Luo Tian was also surprised; this blade could evolve by absorbing human blood, truly astonishing.

“Buzz……” The hum echoed from Luo Tian’s hand as the Rending Sky Spear radiated strong discontent, protesting Luo Tian’s focus on the blade.

“Enough! Enjoy slowly,” Gao Jie sneered, “I’ll let your blood vanish bit by bit until you’re a dry corpse!”

Because if Luo Tian was touched, he would weaken. In this way, Gao Jie planned to wear him down.

“How come Luo Tian’s face looks off?” Some bone-fragmentation elders felt a subtle pallor on Luo Tian’s face.

“It’s the blade!”

“The blade absorbed one drop of Luo Tian’s essence when it cut his arm! That’s the key issue!”

“That means, in the next battle, Luo Tian mustn’t let the blade touch him! If it does, his essence will be forcibly absorbed! How can he fight then?” The peak masters and elders whispered among themselves, their eyes finding the problem.

“Then I’ll end this early!” Luo Tian saw Gao Jie rushing toward him and sneered.

He raised the Rending Sky Spear, filling the arena with a flurry of spear attacks and the blade’s red light.

“Five Elements Mutual Generation, King’s Seal!” Luo Tian chanted while fighting, the Five Elements Mutual Generation King’s Seal.

Luo Tian had mastered this technique to perfection; his fingers moved swiftly, forming the seal in under three breaths.

A massive King’s Seal with a “兵” (soldier) character etched at its base appeared above Gao Jie’s head.

Feeling the terrifying energy, Gao Jie knew he couldn’t withstand it. He withdrew his attack and fled.

Chapter 183: Shangguan Hongtu

Seeing Gao Jie flee, Luo Tian sneered. His spiritual sense at its peak controlled the seal while locating Gao Jie’s running form. The seal crashed down with a thunderous boom.

“Boom……” A deafening explosion echoed, and a striking “兵” character appeared on the arena.

“Good!” The Five Elements Sect disciples erupted in excitement, their admiration for Luo Tian deepening. At this moment, he was like a deity to them.

The Black Yin Sect’s people turned pale, watching Gao Jie lying defeated on the ground. Their faces bore worry; Gao Jie clearly had no strength left.

Gao Jie was truly pitiful—his Heart-Refining Blade lay discarded, and he crouched on the ground like a large toad, trembling uncontrollably.

Luo Tian sneered, appearing before Gao Jie again and stomping his back with a foot, producing a crisp sound of bones breaking.

Though Gao Jie could barely move, his eyes glared at Luo Tian with hatred; if looks could kill, Luo Tian would have died countless times.

“You like killing? How does it feel to be at someone else’s mercy?” Luo Tian smiled, his voice almost kind.

“You can’t kill me; if you do, the feud between the Black Yin Sect and Five Elements Sect will never end!” Gao Jie gasped, his last strength. Though Luo Tian smiled, he felt the intense killing intent in his eyes.

“Why did you kill so many of my sect’s people?” Luo Tian’s voice lowered.

“Luo Tian! You’d better let him go! Otherwise, the Black Yin Sect will spare no effort to destroy you!” Du Yongchang shouted, his face dark.

“Senior Luo, kill him! Avenge our Five Elements Sect!” The disciples roared.

“You bastard Du, do you have any shame? When he killed our sect’s geniuses, what did we say? Now that he’s dead, you’re threatening us?” Wu Taiping sneered at Du Yongchang.

“Hmph! What are those dead people? Just trash. We were helping your Five Elements Sect clean up!” Du Yongchang’s senior elder sneered.

Hearing his elders’ words, Du Yongchang frowned and glanced at the elder before continuing: “Luo Tian, if you let Gao Jie go, I’ll promise no further contact with the Black Yin Sect!”

“Contact? Sorry, it’s already begun. There’s no turning back. If one of our sect’s disciples is killed by the Black Yin Sect after today, I’ll hunt every one of them!” Luo Tian coldly replied.

“Damn fool!” Du Yongchang cursed, his teeth gritted at Luo Tian’s stubbornness.

The Five Elements Sect disciples cheered upon hearing Luo Tian’s bold words, their resentment toward him vanishing. They roared his name in excitement.

Du Yongchang felt frustrated; this kid could’ve been crushed with one palm, saving Gao Jie. But he knew if he moved, it would trigger a full-scale war between the two sects—something Du Yongchang couldn’t allow.

“What conditions do you have?” Du Yongchang restrained his anger and asked.

“Death match, each to their fate. I believe if I were captured by him, he’d kill me without hesitation. Compared to him, I’ve been merciful, right?” Luo Tian stepped on Gao Jie, who lay like a dead dog.

Gao Jie gritted his teeth but was in such bad shape that Luo Tian’s Five Elements Mutual Generation King’s Seal had done too much damage.

“Enough! It’s time I send you to your grave!” Luo Tian sneered, raising the Rending Sky Spear high. Like a black lightning bolt, it plunged into Gao Jie’s back.

Luo Tian raised the spear, lifting Gao Jie high before throwing him onto the Black Yin Sect’s crowd.

“Ah!” Du Yongchang howled, his eyes fixed on Luo Tian as if he wanted to devour him alive.

“Good! Good! Good!” Du Yongchang gritted his teeth, saying the three words before falling silent.

“Good! You’re truly Luo Tian!” The Five Elements Sect disciples cheered, shouting his name.

At this moment, Luo Tian was the center of attention, shining like a sun.

The Black Yin Sect’s situation was dire; they had three sect leader candidates, and now two were dead at Luo Tian’s hands. Shi Fengyu was also severely injured.

“Good job! You’re truly our younger brother!” Lei Yong laughed, his face proud as he looked at the other peak masters.

Wei Mingxuan wore a faint smile, exhaling relief.

Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu stood among the crowd, their eyes filled with admiration for Luo Tian. He was too strong; his power made them feel immense pressure.

“You might just be the one I’ve been searching for,” Yang Huanyu said, a determined look on his face.

As the Black Yin Sect fell into sorrowful silence, an discordant voice rang out:

“Master, don’t worry. I’ll avenge Gao Jie for you!”

Hearing this, Du Yongchang’s body trembled. His face bore disbelief as he turned to the young man who spoke.

The Black Yin Sect disciples also heard the youth’s words, turning their eyes to this calm young man.

Luo Tian picked up Gao Jie’s Heart-Refining Blade, sensing its uniqueness. But now wasn’t the time to investigate; he placed it in his storage ring.

After finishing this, Luo Tian’s gaze turned to the Black Yin Sect’s final youth, his eyes finally showing a hint of seriousness. He could feel this young man was stronger than Gao Jie.

“Thank you,” Du Yongchang said unusually, then glared at Luo Tian with venom, believing Luo Tian was already doomed.

“You’re too kind; it’s my duty!” The youth smiled, like a neighborly boy.

Under Du Yongchang’s eager gaze, the youth stepped onto the arena and bowed to Luo Tian: “Black Yin Sect, Shangguan Hongtu. Please teach me!”

Chapter 184: The Final Opponent

Hearing the youth’s name, Luo Tian furrowed his brow. Perhaps due to his connection with the Yellownight Sect’s Shangguan family, he felt an inexplicable dislike toward anyone named Shangguan.

“Doesn’t that sound familiar?” Shangguan Hongtu smiled playfully, watching Luo Tian.

Hearing the playful expression on Shangguan Hongtu’s face, Luo Tian scrutinized his features. The more he looked, the more he felt this man resembled Shangguan Qingfeng and Shangguan Qingyu.

“Ah, I see! Yes, I am from the Shangguan family!” Shangguan Hongtu said with arrogance.

“Shangguan family!” Luo Tian’s face turned pale; he hadn’t expected to meet a member of the Shangguan family here. He knew this Shangguan Hongtu might have come for him.

“Qianxue and Gulei are in trouble with the Shangguan family?” Luo Tian thought anxiously, but his face remained calm.

“Are you here to find me?” Luo Tian asked.

“You could say that. But it’s worth it for you to enter the Five Elements Sect’s Purifying Pool. However, my main purpose is to kill you!” Shangguan Hongtu chuckled, but his smile carried a killing intent.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian sighed, relieved that if he was here to find him, it meant Qianxue and Gulei weren’t in trouble with the Yellownight Sect. It was likely Shangguan Fei feared his growth and potential threat to the Yellownight Sect or Shangguan family.

“Why did the Yellownight Sect send only a body-refinement ninth-stage disciple to kill me?” Luo Tian was puzzled and asked again.

“You’re too proud! You think the Yellownight Sect would send someone for you? You’re not even a flea to them! Believe me, I’ll erase your cultivation and keep you away from Qianxue. That woman isn’t for you to touch!” Shangguan Hongtu said, as if he were doing it for Luo Tian’s good.

Luo Tian suddenly understood the situation, sighing inwardly at the saying “beauty brings disaster.” This kid clearly liked Qianxue, or perhaps someone higher up in status did. They had sent him to trouble Luo Tian. But seeing his arrogant demeanor, Luo Tian leaned toward the former.

“Enough talk; let’s fight!” Luo Tian had no patience for such people.

“You’re bold! Then I’ll have to kill you here!” Shangguan Hongtu smiled confidently, rushing forward.

A fist filled with three elements’ energy smashed toward Luo Tian under the crowd’s eyes.

“Gold, Wood, Light! Three elements!” Luo Tian saw Shangguan Hongtu’s element and was shocked—Shangguan Hongtu had a three-element constitution, one of which was the rare Light element.

“His not from the Black Yin Sect!” Wei Mingxuan stood there, his face dark. As a northern region sect leader, he knew the Black Yin Sect’s young geniuses. This three-element constitution genius wasn’t in his memory.

“His likely a disciple of the Yellownight Sect’s Shangguan family. The rumors might be true; the Black Yin Sect could be a branch of the Yellownight Sect!” Si Tu Anle, from the Flame Peak, spoke.

Upon hearing this, the Five Elements Sect elders and peak masters were shocked. Though the Yellownight Sect was renowned in southern regions, their sect’s depth could easily match it. Yet they hadn’t expected the Black Yin Sect in the northern region to be a branch of the Yellownight Sect. How strong was the Yellownight Sect? This thought left Mu Nianqing and Wu Taiping with bitterness, as their disciples had been forcibly taken by the Yellownight Sect.

Du Yongchang saw Shangguan Hongtu reveal his identity but showed no surprise. The Black Yin Sect was indeed a branch of the Yellownight Sect; today, it was fitting to let Shangguan Hongtu officially declare this to boost the Black Yin Sect’s reputation.

As people pondered, the arena blazed with light. Shangguan Hongtu leaped into the sky, his foot smashing toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s face was serious; he couldn’t afford to be careless. His qi droplets rapidly converted into energy, filling his fists as he hurled them at the sky.

“Boom……” a dull sound echoed from the arena again.

The stone arena, just repaired, cracked once more with fine lines.

“Light Flash!” Shangguan Hongtu cried as he landed, transforming into a streak of light toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian was momentarily stunned by the sudden speed; Shangguan Hongtu’s speed was too fast, even surpassing his spiritual sense. It was comparable to the bone-fragmentation early-stage elder he had killed.

In that moment of hesitation, Luo Tian’s chest felt a sharp pain—his chest was struck by a white fist.

Luo Tian retreated, ignoring the pain and forming the King’s Seal with his hands. The seal smashed into the streak of light.

Being struck by the King’s Seal, Shangguan Hongtu’s form finally revealed itself. His face wore a playful smile: “Good, you can match my speed. You’re worthy of being the top in this northern region!”

Luo Tian said nothing, his Rending Sky Spear materializing in his hand. He also thought about his shortcomings; his constitution was strong, his body comparable to bone-fragmentation. But his only weakness was speed—though it was fast compared to some, it lagged behind those skilled in speed and martial arts.

If not for his spiritual sense and constitution surpassing body-refinement, he might have been severely injured in an instant.

“Warm-up over; now, welcome to your death!” Shangguan Hongtu spoke softly, his body transforming into a streak of light, circling Luo Tian.

Gradually, five Shangguan Hongtus appeared before Luo Tian, leaving him confused as he couldn’t distinguish the real one.

“This is too fast!” The Five Elements Sect disciples watched the five figures, concern in their eyes as they looked at Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian is strong everywhere, but his speed lags behind Shangguan Hongtu’s significantly!” Zhang Hongyun said quietly, worry on his face.

As people murmured, five Shangguan Hongtus attacked simultaneously, strange energy seals flying from his hands toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian knew these seals weren’t simple and pushed his speed to the limit, trying to dodge them.

Chapter 185: Outburst

“Trying to escape? Can you?” Shangguan Hongtu sneered, his hands speeding up. The energy seals flew faster from the five figures.

Though Luo Tian was fast, he was struck by the overwhelming energy seals.

The strange seals vanished upon touching Luo Tian’s body, as if they had no attack power.

Luo Tian furrowed his brow, confusion on his face—what was the danger of these strange seals?

The crowd also looked puzzled at Luo Tian, expecting a powerful martial art from Shangguan Hongtu. Yet they found Luo Tian still standing, leading to confusion.

The five figures merged into one; Shangguan Hongtu’s face wore a slight smile, his cold voice echoing: “Wood Seal! Explosion!”

“Boom! Boom!” Two cracks echoed from Luo Tian’s shoulders and legs, blood spattering his clothes.

Luo Tian was shocked; he felt the explosion’s location was where Shangguan Hongtu had struck him with those mysterious seals. Though these two hits weren’t fatal, he remembered having at least ten of these energy seals hit him.

“Gold Seal! Explosion!”

“Light Seal! Explosion!” Without waiting for Luo Tian to react, Shangguan Hongtu’s cold voice echoed again.

Explosions rang out repeatedly on Luo Tian, blood spattering with each sound. After several explosions, Luo Tian was drenched in blood, his face pale—these mysterious seals had caused serious damage.

“What is this martial art? It’s so strong! Even my body can be harmed!” Luo Tian was shocked, wiping his lips’ blood with a serious expression.

“Indeed, the Yellownight Sect’s prodigy! I think Luo Tian will be done after this attack!” Du Yongchang’s elder sighed.

“Luo Tian is indeed remarkable; he endured this attack and still has the strength to fight! If he continues growing, in ten years, the northern region will be his stage!” Du Yongchang’s face showed a hint of killing intent; to him, Luo Tian had become a potential threat.

Seeing Luo Tian hadn’t fallen but still fought, Shangguan Hongtu was also surprised. This martial art, called the Three-Elements Seal, he had found in a tomb of an exorcist elder. It could harm even bone-fragmentation elders, but Luo Tian, a mere body-refinement disciple, hadn’t fallen.

“I don’t believe you can withstand another!” Shangguan Hongtu’s lips curled, his body flashing again.

“Can’t let him continue; another hit and I’ll be severely injured, losing combat capability!” Luo Tian decided to counterattack. Otherwise, when Shangguan Hongtu formed five figures again, it would be hard to stop.

Wood-element energy moistened his wounds; golden-energy was infused into his feet, and he rushed toward the three figures Shangguan Hongtu had formed.

“Golden Snake Wild Dance!” Luo Tian raised the Rending Sky Spear, a flurry of spear attacks forming into a golden snake that smashed one figure.

“Five Elements Mutual Generation, King’s Seal!” Luo Tian didn’t stop his attack, his hands moving swiftly to launch the King’s Seal.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian himself flew toward another figure, his fists wrapped in five-element energy and stained with blood, smashing into the third figure.

The explosion shattered Shangguan Hongtu’s three figures.

As Luo Tian attacked the three figures, two more formed. Two figures’ hands moved swiftly, and familiar energy seals flew from their hands toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with coldness; he dodged, his body’s aura suddenly changing.

“Body-Refinement Stage Nine… Bone-Fragmentation Early… Mid…
Bone-Fragmentation Peak!”

His aura grew until it reached Bone-Fragmentation Peak, then stopped. It was the imitation skill he hadn’t used in a while—copying a higher-level technique.
