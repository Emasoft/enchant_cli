Jiang Le Rong was frozen in place, her vast divine awareness sweeping ceaselessly in all directions. Yet still, she detected no sign of anyone's presence.

"Who!" Jiang Le Rong growled lowly, her voice echoing through the surroundings.

"Hmm..." Dragon Baby's advancing form abruptly halted. Though he too sensed an ominous danger, it was not aimed at himself.

The silence that met Jiang Le Rong's cry was absolute. Yet the feeling of a blade pressed against her neck grew stronger.

Chapter 587: Retreat

Chapter 587: Retreat

Luo Tian's divine awareness still lingered. Faintly, he sensed someone hidden within the surrounding space, but he could not discern where this person concealed themselves.

Zhou Ziyan shared the same sensation. Among the three groups, only Luo Tian, Zhou Ziyan, and Dragon Baby perceived this danger. Jiang Le Rong's perception was even more acute.

"Retreat!" Under the looming threat of death, Jiang Le Rong made a decisive choice. She dispelled her terrifying lotus martial technique and vanished from the spot, appearing before her companions. Without hesitation, she led them southward.

Long Jie knew Jiang Le Rong intended to flee. He could not stop her, nor did he attempt to. Transforming into human form, he returned before Luo Tian, his gaze cautious as he observed Zhou Ziyan's group.

As Jiang Le Rong departed, the terrifying killing intent dissipated from Luo Tian and Zhou Ziyan's perception. Both exhaled a breath of relief.

"Unknown friend, thank you for aiding me!" Luo Tian bellowed toward the partially sealed void that Dragon Baby and Jiang Le Rong had pierced.

Yet no response came to Luo Tian's call, as if no one had ever existed.

Seeing no reply, Luo Tian's face bore disappointment. He then turned his gaze toward Zhou Ziyan.

"Laughing, Luo Xiong, do not worry. I bear no ill will. I am also an enemy of Jiang Le Rong. I hope to have a chance at cooperation within the Ancient Immortal Ruins!" Zhou Ziyan, seeing Luo Tian's caution, smiled kindly and spoke.

Perceiving the sincerity in Zhou Ziyan's eyes, Luo Tian returned a slight smile. Without Zhou Ziyan's presence, the initial encounter with Jiang Le Rong might have ended in a bloody clash.

"Brother Zhou, your courtesy is appreciated. If not for your aid, that woman would have been quite troublesome. Thank you for assisting us!" Luo Tian also laughed heartily, bowing respectfully to Zhou Ziyan.

Seeing that Luo Tian did not invite them onto Dragon Baby's back, Zhou Ziyan understood Luo Tian's reservations. He made no further attempt to stay, exchanging a few more polite words before vanishing from the spot. He too flew southward.

"Brother, who was that person? Why did they help us?" Long Jie approached Luo Tian, his youthful face revealing no hint of the golden dragon he had just clashed with a Soul-Annihilation Realm powerhouse.

"I don't know. If they aided us, they are certainly not our enemy," Luo Tian shook his head, his gaze deepening.

As the others heard this exchange, they vaguely suspected someone had assisted them. Otherwise, how could Jiang Le Rong have let them off so easily?

"Strength!" At this moment, besides Luo Tian and Long Jie, the other dozen individuals felt their own inadequacies. Though they were top-tier prodigies in the Northern Domain, compared to Jiang Le Rong's group, they still lagged significantly. This left the group feeling somewhat indignant.

"Let's go. We must speed up, or we might miss the Ruins' opening!" Luo Tian spoke, his gaze turning southward.

At the same time, Luo Tian's mind was deeply troubled. This was only their initial steps into the Southern Domain, yet already it had been so intense. If they entered the Ancient Immortal Ruins, it would be even more brutal.

"Roar..." The Soul-Embrace Realm dragon let out a thunderous roar, flying southward.

...

The Southern Domain stretched endlessly. At this moment, the very heart of the domain was filled with fierce winds. Across the entire Tianyuan Continent, countless cultivators converged upon this place.

The site of the Ancient Immortal Ruins' opening was bustling with activity. Cultivators moved about, gathering here without a single commoner in sight. Not only were there no commoners, but even those below the Soul-Embrace Realm could not be seen. Among this vast crowd, the weakest cultivators were at the Soul-Embrace Realm level, and most bore youthful faces.

People gathered in small groups on open ground, observing one another. Some familiar figures chatted idly, all waiting for the Ruins' opening.

This massive gathering split into three factions: those from the Eastern, Northern, and Southern Domains. The Southern Domain's group was the largest, while the Eastern Domain's was the smallest. They eyed each other cautiously.

"Buzz..." The vibrations of spiritual energy and the sound of breaking air continually echoed. Each new arrival drew everyone's attention.

"This is Chen Changsheng from the Northern Domain's Water Source Temple!" The Northern Domain group expressed admiration, watching three young men in Daoist robes appear before them.

"Ha!" Meanwhile, the two major groups from the Eastern and Southern Domains looked at Chen Changsheng in the sky with disdain.

Though the Northern Domain's territory was vast, compared to the other two domains, its spiritual energy was impoverished. Even the Five Elements Sect's spiritual concentration would be considered second-rate in the Southern Domain. Thus, the Northern Domain's overall strength lagged behind the other three domains. Others looked down on them, much like how Feng Tianxiong and others had once looked down on Luo Tian.

After Chen Changsheng, figures like Ying Hongtu and other Northern Domain prodigies arrived. Naturally, they did not suffer the Southern Domain's disdain.

After several years, Chen Changsheng and Ying Hongtu—those who had once been Luo Tian's contemporaries—had all grown significantly. Some even reached the Soul-Annihilation Realm.

Upon meeting, they were filled with nostalgia but also anger. Feeling the disdainful glances from the Eastern and Southern Domains, these prodigies were furious. Yet they restrained themselves, their gazes filled with hostility toward the other two groups.

"Changsheng Brother!" A voice of surprise echoed through the Southern Domain group. It was Feng Tianxiong from the Southern Domain's Subduing Demon Sect, who had once entered the cave space with Chen Changsheng. Now Feng Tianxiong had reached the peak of Soul-Embrace Realm, just a step away from the Soul-Annihilation Realm.

Hearing someone call him, Chen Changsheng turned his gaze toward the Southern Domain. Seeing it was Feng Tianxiong, he wore a slight smile. They had not met since their parting in the cave space; now meeting again, it was naturally heartwarming.

"Luotian has been quite successful recently. Where is he? Why hasn't he arrived yet?" Feng Tianxiong asked with a smile.

"He's been quite active these years. I haven't seen him since we last parted ways," Chen Changsheng said with a nostalgic tone.

"Hmph. A Northern Domain prodigy, that's all he is. He can only be famous in the North. Once here in the South, he'll inevitably be overshadowed by other prodigies!" The two spoke as a somewhat mocking voice echoed in their ears.

Chapter 588: Gathering of Prodigies

"Hmm?" Chen Changsheng heard this voice and furrowed his brows, turning to see the person approaching.

"Xu Kaicheng?" Feng Tianxiong frowned, speaking the name of the approaching figure.

Chen Changsheng naturally sensed Xu Kaicheng's strength. Simply by observing the respectful glances of the Southern Domain people, he knew Xu Kaicheng had some reputation here.

What made Chen Changsheng familiar was one of the group behind Xu Kaicheng—Chai Xiangming, the man who had once attacked Luo Tian to obtain the Locking Spirit Tower.

The Southern Domain prodigies dominated, with some even ranking them. Though not entirely comprehensive, the rankings were generally accurate. Those who made it into the top 100 were undoubtedly renowned in the Southern Domain's younger generation.

"Xu Kaicheng, the Young Master of the Southern Domain's Tianji Cliff, ranks in the top twenty within the domain. His strength is truly terrifying!" People hearing this name recalled information about Xu Kaicheng.

Chai Xiangming did not speak when he saw Chen Changsheng and Feng Tianxiong's gazes. He merely stood respectfully behind Xu Kaicheng.

"Xiangming, you were forced to lose three drops of essence blood in the North Domain. Was that due to conflict with these two?" Xu Kaicheng turned and asked Chai Xiangming.

The mention of this incident made Chai Xiangming's face change. He recalled the formidable man who had once been like a demon, his expression turning grim as he nodded slightly.

"Haha, has Luo Tian arrived yet?" Xu Kaicheng loudly asked, his voice like thunder echoing in the Northern Domain group's ears, causing people to startle slightly.

"Luo Tian hasn't arrived yet. If there's something you want to say, just tell me!" Chen Changsheng spoke, his gaze turning cold.

"You're not worthy. Besides that one named Luo Tian, I've never really looked down on anyone from the Northern Domain!" Xu Kaicheng's gaze was calm, looking down at the Northern Domain group with disdain.

"Arrogant!" Hearing Xu Kaicheng's arrogance, which had dismissed the entire Northern Domain, the group felt anger. All eyes turned hostile toward Xu Kaicheng, ready to rush forward if someone led the charge.

"What? Disagree? Whoever disagrees can just fight!" Xu Kaicheng laughed arrogantly, his gaze sweeping over the Northern Domain group.

"You're not worth it. I'll make sure to beat Luo Tian so thoroughly he doesn't recognize his ancestors!" Xu Kaicheng grew more emboldened.

"Water Source Temple, Chen Changsheng. I wish to test your strength!" Chen Changsheng's aura of water and wood energy spread, his staff falling into his hand as he spoke darkly to Xu Kaicheng.

"Thunder Sect's Ying Hongtu. Xu Kaicheng, are you brave enough to fight?" Ying Hongtu's body crackled with lightning energy as he appeared opposite Xu Kaicheng.

"Xuanyin Sect... Lian Shen Sect... Bai Lian Sect..." Other top Northern Domain sects' prodigies also stepped forward, their auras surging as they eyed Xu Kaicheng with hostility.

"Good! All of you come at once. I'll see what talent the Northern Domain truly has!" Xu Kaicheng's eyes flashed like lightning as he scanned over these people.

"Xu Kaicheng, why are you so arrogant? I thought I was the most arrogant, but now I see you're even more so!" A cheerful voice echoed from afar. Ten figures with powerful fluctuations appeared in people's sight.

"Senior Brother!" Feng Tianxiong, hearing the voice, wore a look of excitement as he called out.

Hearing the sound, people turned their gazes toward the sky. They were all stunned, even the Southern Domain group showed excitement.

"Jin Wulong! I didn't expect Jin Wulong to arrive so quickly. Are the other prodigies coming soon too?" People exclaimed, shifting their gazes from Xu Kaicheng's group to the sky. The man standing there radiated an endless arrogance.

"Subduing Demon Sect, Jin Wulong. His dual-element body type is legendary in the Southern Domain's prodigy rankings, placing third. His strength is极致, with legends claiming he received a transmission from the Ancient Immortal Dragon Clan, granting him the formidable physique of dragons!" People's gazes were filled with endless admiration as they watched the figure in the sky.

"Jin Wulong, I didn't expect you to arrive so early!" Xu Kaicheng's face darkened as he looked toward Jin Wulong in the sky. He hadn't expected him to arrive so early.

But he had previously intimidated Feng Tianxiong of the Subduing Demon Sect, which now made him regretful.

"Get lost... I knew you were just showing off against weaker people! If one of my disciples loses a single hair, I'll sever your arm!" Jin Wulong's face bore cold light as he muttered.

Seeing Jin Wulong not giving him any respect, Xu Kaicheng's face darkened to the point of fury. His gaze locked onto Jin Wulong, but ultimately he chose to give up. He knew his gap with Jin Wulong was too great; fighting would bring him no good.

As Xu Kaicheng struggled to save face, another sound of breaking air echoed. Thousands of figures appeared in people's sight, drawing their gazes back to the sky to see if the top three prodigies had arrived.

"Senior Brother Jin, you came early again!" As figures moved, people greeted Jin Wulong.

Yet among these figures were several with unusually powerful auras, causing people to show excitement.

"Yanming Sect's Shangguan Hongtu! It was said he once nearly died at the hands of the Five Elements Sect's Luo Tian, surviving only by a fragment of his soul. I wonder what would happen if he met Luo Tian now!" People marveled, watching the figure from Yanming Sect.

If Luo Tian were present, he would certainly recognize Shangguan Hongtu's group. Some of them he was familiar with.

Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei stood behind Wang Siyuan, their aura of Soul-Embrace Peak radiating from them. Especially Gu Qianxue, clearly having failed the soul trial but not perishing, her aura far stronger than a typical Soul-Embrace Peak.

Another figure was also familiar to Luo Tian—that was the man who had nearly taken his life in the Wind Valley, standing coldly behind Wang Siyuan.

On the other side, Jiang Le Rong of the Qionghua Sect and Zhou Ziyan of the Lingxiao Pavilion also appeared one after another in people's sight.

Then, a cold aura spread across the sky. The people from Ice Pole Island of the Southern Domain also arrived shortly after, standing in the sky.

Chapter 589: Servant

People gazed at the Southern Domain's prodigies with reverence. They had always held a sense of awe toward these individuals.

The crowd continued to gather, with more people on the ground and in the sky. Soon, all but the first mysterious Tian Luo among the Southern Domain's younger generation had arrived.

"Xiu! How is Jin Wulong stronger now? Do you have a chance against him?" Shangguan Hongtu turned to Xiu, whose expression was cold and indifferent.

The Southern Domain people also directed their gazes toward Xiu's calm face, even his unremarkable appearance. This was because Xiu currently ranked second among the younger generation. He had once killed a Soul-Annihilation Realm powerhouse with his Soul-Embrace Peak strength, securing his second-place position.

As for the first-ranked Tian Luo, he had never shown himself. Tian Luo was like a mountain pressing over all the younger generation of the Southern Domain.

Xiu had killed a Soul-Annihilation Realm powerhouse through ambush, but Tian Luo had done it by clashing head-on with a Soul-Annihilation Realm powerhouse at his Soul-Embrace Peak level, then killing him. This terrifying feat had never occurred since ancient times.

Hearing Shangguan Hongtu's question, Xiu did not answer. His face was emotionless as he scanned the crowd, leaving no one able to discern what Xiu was thinking.

"Roar..." A low dragon roar echoed, but it caused no stir. A Soul-Embrace Realm dragon was not enough to draw their attention.

Luo Tian and his group were currently on this dragon, listening to people marveling at the strength of these Southern Domain prodigies. This left Luo Tian and his group in awe, as well as admiration for the Southern Domain's might.

At the same time, Luo Tian saw Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei. Though he longed to meet them, his current state was not suitable.

"Eastern Domain has also arrived. It's the three major sects of Kunlun Mountain!" People murmured, as another sound of breaking air echoed. The Zheng family's three brothers from the Wind Valley, Leng Qiuchan, and Duan Xingchen also arrived with their groups, scanning the sky filled with people as if searching for someone.

Not only did the three major sects arrive, but other sects from Kunlun Mountain also had prodigies coming. For example, Dan Sect's prodigies and other renowned sects from Kunlun Mountain had all arrived to participate in this once-in-a-thousand-years Ancient Immortal Ruins.

"Eastern, Southern, and Northern Domains have all arrived. What about the Western Domain?" Luo Tian's gaze flickered, his vast divine awareness scanning through the crowd to see if the mysterious Western Domain had arrived.

Lu Kunpeng's venom was from the Western Domain. If it truly had a connection, Luo Tian wouldn't mind settling accounts with the Western Domain's people.

"Northern Domain people, has your Luo Tian arrived yet?" Shangguan Hongtu's face bore a cruel expression as he looked toward the Northern Domain group, his fierce gaze scanning repeatedly but failing to spot Luo Tian who was低调 in the sky.

"Luo Tian!"

"Yes! So many people have arrived, and the Ancient Immortal Ruins are about to open. Why hasn't Luo Tian come yet? Is he not going in?" People murmured, constantly scanning around.

"Shangguan Hongtu! What are you trying to do?" Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei's faces bore killing intent as they questioned.

"Haha, that Luo Tian has apparently become a broken man now. He can't even fly in the air; he's only riding this dragon!" Jiang Le Rong's face bore mockery as she glanced at Luo Tian's dragon.

As Jiang Le Rong spoke, people's gazes instantly focused on Luo Tian and his group. When they saw a commoner on the dragon, the entire crowd erupted in chaos.

"Stupid woman!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, cursing under his breath. Then his mind trembled, unsure of what had gone wrong.

Earlier, after he disguised himself and met Jiang Le Rong, his image had spread to Feiyan City. And when he encountered her before, she had apparently discovered him early on. She had also spotted him from the crowd just now. If Luo Tian didn't know what was making Jiang Le Rong find him, he would have lived in vain.

"Luo Tian!" Chen Changsheng and the Northern Domain group's faces showed a touch of excitement, watching the ordinary figure on the dragon.

Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei's gazes held excitement as they looked at Luo Tian, but for some reason, they did not fly toward him.

"One hour remains!" Luo Tian calculated the time in his mind. He stood on the dragon, smiling as he surveyed those looking at him.

When Luo Tian's gaze met Xiu's, they exchanged a glance. Luo Tian gave a slight start, his lips curling slightly.

"You are Luo Tian?" Jin Wulong's body carried a hint of battle intent as he looked at Luo Tian.

"Yes," Luo Tian nodded lightly. He patted the dragon's back and flew toward the Northern Domain group.

Luo Tian ignored the others' surprised expressions. He greeted Chen Changsheng and others, exchanging greetings.

"Can you fight?" As Luo Tian landed, a voice from the crowd shouted. It was particularly loud from Xu Kaicheng.

"Despicable!" Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei's faces bore coldness as they shouted back. Zhou Ziyan, Jin Wulong, and others also looked at Xu Kaicheng with disdain.

"Haha, you're not worthy!" Luo Tian coldly replied. His gaze was clear and calm. He had heard of Xu Kaicheng's constant mockery toward Northern Domain cultivators.

"Ah..." People inhaled sharply, their gazes filled with admiration as they looked at Luo Tian. Especially the Northern Domain cultivators hadn't expected Luo Tian to be so bold in this situation.

While Southern Domain cultivators some sighed at Xu Kaicheng's arrogance, they hadn't expected this ordinary prodigy to be even more arrogant.

"You're not worthy? Then dare you fight? Pick anyone you like. If you win, from now on I'll avoid you. If you lose, just produce three drops of essence blood and shout three times that Northern Domain cultivators are useless. How about it?" Xu Kaicheng's gaze carried a hint of mockery as he looked at the Northern Domain cultivators.

The Northern Domain people, seeing Xu Kaicheng's arrogance, glared at him with anger. They longed to rush forward and tear Xu Kaicheng apart.

"You truly aren't worthy. Your strength is inferior to my servant. And provoking me never requires avoiding, because I've always had the habit of leaving survivors!" Luo Tian coldly replied. His gaze swept over Jiang Le Rong and Shangguan Hongtu before finally settling on Ice Pole Island's Luo Han, his face filled with a smile.

Chapter 590: Those Who Insult Me Shall Die

People around wore expressions of confusion, unsure who Luo Tian's servant was. They followed Luo Tian's gaze toward Ice Pole Island.

"Luo Han! I didn't expect it to be true. Luo Tian really defeated Luo Han!" The Southern Domain people finally stirred, their gazes toward Luo Tian changing.

Yet some still doubted that Luo Tian had defeated Luo Han. They loudly mocked, "Luo Han is your servant? That's really shameless. If Luo Han is your servant, then the number one prodigy Tian Luo would be my older brother!"

"Haha..." The crowd erupted in laughter, looking at Luo Tian.

Xu Kaicheng's brows furrowed slightly. He looked toward Luo Han, who had remained silent since arriving, and spoke softly: "Luo Han, are you truly Luo Tian's servant?"

All eyes turned toward Ice Pole Island's Luo Han, waiting for his answer.

Feeling the fiery gazes of everyone, Luo Han's face darkened. His fists clenched tightly as he looked at Xu Kaicheng.

At this moment, Luo Han longed to flay Xu Kaicheng's skin and pull out his tendons. If it weren't for this person inciting the issue, Luo Tian wouldn't have mentioned it.

"Luo Han! Go and deal with this arrogant bastard!" Luo Tian stood on the dragon's back, speaking to Luo Han.

"Crack..." Luo Han gritted his teeth. However, with Lu Nan Tian's return, the Lu clan's battle line had become ascendant. Their lineage had turned into a secondary branch, and according to clan rules, they were required to obey the main branch's commands.

Though Luo Han was a prodigy, long-term family values had deeply imprinted in every member of the Lu clan. The principle was that internal conflicts were allowed, but when facing enemies, they must unite against them.

"Luo Han! Come here!" Luo Han roared, his gaze icy as he looked at Xu Kaicheng.

"Ah..." A gasp echoed through the crowd, their gazes filled with disbelief. They stepped back in fear, not expecting Luo Tian's words to be true. Even Xiu and Jin Wulong showed a hint of surprise, looking at Luo Tian and Luo Han.

As people stepped back, the area around Luo Han and Xu Kaicheng became a vacuum. No one wanted to be caught in the crossfire.

Luo Han's gaze bore killing intent. He stepped into the void, his form flashing as he appeared before Xu Kaicheng in an instant. Three-element spiritual energy erupted, and a punch struck toward Xu Kaicheng.

"Unexpectedly, Luo Han has also reached the Soul-Annihilation Realm!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He felt a sense of urgency, as he had yet to enter the Soul-Annihilation Realm and was already lagging behind his peers.

"Traversing the path of cultivation is like rowing upstream. If you don't advance, you'll fall behind," Luo Tian whispered to himself, feeling his current strength was clearly insufficient.

As Luo Tian murmured to himself, Luo Han and Xu Kaicheng clashed. The sound of explosions filled the air, and the surrounding void gradually became unstable.

Though Xu Kaicheng ranked in the top twenty of prodigies, compared to Luo Han, who ranked seventh among Southern Domain prodigies, he was significantly weaker in both attributes and combat strength.

Xu Kaicheng's face bore fear. He barely dodged Luo Han's attacks, regretting his decision. He hadn't expected Luo Han to actually obey Luo Tian's orders and deal with him.

"Damn it, where is your prodigy pride? Why are you really serving as a servant!" Xu Kaicheng mentally shouted. His martial techniques were constantly unleashed, but he was still pushed back by Luo Han.

"Snow Without Cold!" Luo Han roared. The temperature of the entire world abruptly changed, and snow began to fall within a hundred miles. Luo Han's surroundings became extremely cold.

"Damn it! Fire God's Incantation!" Xu Kaicheng, in a desperate situation, roared and unleashed fire-element spiritual energy seals from his hands. These seals landed on his body.

"Useless!" Luo Han pointed with a finger, and ice-element spiritual energy erupted again, surrounding Xu Kaicheng.

"Buzz..." As the seals vibrated, Xu Kaicheng's movements slowed. Finally, he couldn't withstand it, and the fire-element spiritual energy seals on his body shattered.

"Crack..." At the moment the seals broke, Luo Tian let out a cold snort. His hands clenched tightly.

"Absolute Zero!" Luo Han roared, and snowflakes within a hundred miles rushed toward the sluggish Xu Kaicheng, enveloping him.

"Go..." Luo Han let out a cold snort. He kicked with his foot, sending the ice-encased Xu Kaicheng—now a frozen statue—as if kicking a ball, sending it flying toward Xu Kaicheng's head.

"Buzz..." Xu Kaicheng, frozen in place, transformed into a beam of white light under the sun's rays and flew toward Luo Tian's group.

The battle between the two lasted only a moment, yet it left the onlookers stunned. Luo Han's strength had exceeded their expectations.

"Strong! The three-element body type truly is powerful!" Zhou Ziyan's face bore a hint of seriousness. He hadn't dueled with Luo Han, but now seeing his strength, he silently marveled at the Southern Domain's prodigy rankings, which had some discrepancies.

Luo Tian's companions, seeing Xu Kaicheng flying toward them, wore expressions of satisfaction.

"Three breaths... two breaths... one breath! Recovery!" Luo Tian's breathing was heavy, as if he hadn't noticed Xu Kaicheng approaching. He whispered lowly.

As his words ended, Luo Tian's aura surged into the sky. An invisible wave of energy radiated from him, his gaze filled with surprise.

"Body-Refining Realm... Bone-Melting Realm... Soul-Embrace Realm..." In an instant, Luo Tian's cultivation returned to its peak state. His gaze was cold as he looked at Xu Kaicheng flying toward him.

"Southern Domain prodigies! What of it? Offend me, Luo Tian, and you shall die!" Luo Tian coldly snorted. His hands released a碧晶琉璃火 (Bijing Lilu Fire), wrapping around Xu Kaicheng.

With the terrifying temperature of the Bijing Lilu Fire, Xu Kaicheng's ice began to melt gradually. Steam started to appear in the sky.

"Boom!" In an instant, Luo Tian's seven-color wings spread open. His form appeared before Xu Kaicheng, his eyes filled with intense killing intent.

"Die!" The spear of Sheliang struck in his hand. His second technique, "Gold and Stone Break," was thrust toward Xu Kaicheng's throat.

"Pu..." Though Xu Kaicheng was a Soul-Annihilation Realm powerhouse and had dual-element body type, the Sheliang spear was now a Heavenly-grade treasure. It could pierce through an injured and unguarded Soul-Annihilation Realm powerhouse.

The glinting spear tip, like piercing the ground, pierced into Xu Kaicheng's throat under the startled gazes of those around him.

The Sheliang spear's immense destructive power erupted within Xu Kaicheng's body. The formidable Soul-Annihilation Realm body was shattered under this force, blood splattering everywhere.

Chapter 591: Western Domain Appears

Xu Kaicheng's body, under the stunned gazes of people, exploded into a cloud of blood mist. The Bijing Lilu Fire instantly turned him to ashes, scattering in the world. This made the onlookers instinctively tremble.

"Dead? He's dead?" People couldn't believe their eyes, staring at Luo Tian in the sky. They couldn't believe that Luo Tian had so swiftly killed Xu Kaicheng.

"A madman! A real madman!" People's hearts shouted, their gazes toward Luo Tian now filled with fear.

Although Luo Tian had only delivered the final strike, Xu Kaicheng was ultimately killed by Luo Tian's hand.

The Tianji Cliff in the Southern Domain had some status. No one had ever dared to kill a Tianji Cliff person, let alone their Young Master.

Shangguan Hongtu's heart trembled. He recalled the moment Luo Tian had killed him, and he felt the terrifying nature of Luo Tian. His desire to seek revenge on Luo Tian began to waver.

Xiu and Jin Wulong, among those ranked high, wore a calm expression. Though Xu Kaicheng was somewhat strong, compared to them, he still had a significant gap. They weren't particularly concerned about Xu Kaicheng's death, except for Xiu. Others looked at Luo Tian with a surge of excitement.

"Luo Tian, I look forward to battling you when you enter the Soul-Annihilation Realm!" Jin Wulong spoke loudly. Others also felt a surge of battle intent, but as prodigies they naturally sensed Luo Tian hadn't yet entered the Soul-Annihilation Realm, so they weren't eager to fight him now.

"Always at your service!" Luo Tian held his spear, having been a commoner for over twenty days. This had made him extremely frustrated. Now his aura radiated supreme authority, his eyes resolute as he looked at the Southern Domain's prodigies.

"Luo Tian! Well done!" The Northern Domain cultivators, seeing Luo Tian's overwhelming aura, shouted loudly. Those who had long been suppressed by Luo Tian in the Northern Domain erupted into a thunderous cheer.

Though Jin Wulong and others didn't want to fight at different levels, it didn't mean others felt the same. Numerous prodigies ranked in the top twenty kept walking toward Luo Tian, declaring they wanted to fight him and reclaim some face for the Southern Domain.

After all, the Southern Domain people had never looked at the Northern Domain with respect. Now that a prodigy had been killed by Luo Tian, it left the Southern Domain people feeling embarrassed.

"Buzz..." Spiritual energy fluctuations echoed. The strength of the three major sects from the Eastern Domain and Dan Sect appeared before Luo Tian, their gazes resolute as they looked at those facing Luo Tian.

"Long time no see, brother!" Zheng Xin laughed and hugged Luo Tian tightly before standing behind him. His gaze held joy as he approached Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao, exchanging greetings with those behind Luo Tian.

"Long time no see!" Luo Tian smiled, looking at Leng Qiuchan with a black veil over her face. He spoke softly.

Leng Qiuchan looked at Luo Tian, her eyes filled with excitement but she said nothing. Her lips curled slightly under the black veil as she stepped behind Luo Tian, though her gaze was directed toward Gu Qianxue behind Shangguan Hongtu.

Gu Qianxue, who had been observing Luo Tian, saw Leng Qiuchan step behind Luo Tian. Her expression slightly changed as she exchanged glances with Leng Qiuchan.

"Sister, you seem to have a rival!" Gu Lei smiled as he appeared before Gu Qianxue.

"Get lost..." Gu Qianxue kicked Gu Lei away, her gaze toward Luo Tian filled with coldness.

"Ah..." Luo Tian felt a chill rising from his waist, continuously moving up his neck. Seeing Gu Qianxue's gaze, Luo Tian pondered.

Then his gaze settled on Shangguan Hongtu. His face bore a fresh wave of killing intent. Given Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei's personalities, if they hadn't had a compelling reason, they would have immediately come to him. Yet now they hadn't moved and remained by Shangguan Hongtu's side, clearly influenced by something.

"Long time no see, Luo Tian. You left without saying goodbye last time!" A calm voice echoed as Jiang Nanxuan and Meng Yao stood before Luo Tian, their faces filled with smiles.

"Senior Jiang, you've also arrived!" Luo Tian's face bore surprise as he looked at the two in white robes, appearing like celestial companions. He hadn't expected them to come to this Ancient Immortal Ruins.

Among the few people Luo Tian couldn't read in this world, Zhang Daotian, his master, was one. The figure from the轮回画面 (reincarnation picture), Yin Tianxiong, was another. And Jiang Nanxuan was the third.

Luo Tian didn't have time to chat with Jiang Nanxuan in detail. He exchanged greetings and then greeted Duan Xingchen as well, engaging in a brief conversation with Dan Sect's prodigy before turning his cold gaze toward the people shouting loudly above.

As the three major sects from the Eastern Domain stood behind Luo Tian, the Southern Domain people's faces slightly changed. Though they didn't care about the Northern Domain, they did care about the Eastern Domain people. Leng Qiuchan and others were treated especially by various sects in the Southern Domain, and they had a clear understanding of their information.

At this moment, the Northern Domain's forces combined with the Eastern Domain's three major sects and Dan Sect's strength had surpassed their分散 (dispersed) forces by one level. Simply having several Soul-Annihilation Realm cultivators was enough.

"Are you still going to fight?" Luo Tian's face bore mockery as he looked at the unfamiliar people before him, speaking softly.

"Buzz..." As people's gazes were filled with admiration, a sound of breaking air echoed again from the sky. Accompanying this sound was a series of insect cries.

"Buzz..." A vast swarm of black insects filled the sky, even obscuring sunlight as they slowly flew toward people.

Below this insect sea were a dozen young men with strange attire, their faces painted like oil. They walked toward the crowd from the sky.

What stunned people most was that these dozen individuals' auras were remarkably unified, all carrying the aura of the Soul-Annihilation Realm.
