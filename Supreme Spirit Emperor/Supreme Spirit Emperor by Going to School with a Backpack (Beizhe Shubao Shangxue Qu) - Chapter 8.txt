“Five Elements Body! Heh heh heh! I never thought I’d witness the legendary Five Elements Body in my final moments! It’s not a waste of these years waiting after all!” The spectral elder laughed heartily.

“Since it’s the Five Elements Body, there’s no question of suitability. Listen carefully now—old man is about to teach you a golden-element spear technique called Splitting Heaven Spear Technique. I created this myself in conjunction with my Splitting Heaven Spear, and it was the key to my dominance across the Tianyuan Road.” The elder spoke, but before Luo Tian could react, a string of complex incantations was forcibly implanted into his mind.

The spectral elder glanced at the Splitting Heaven Spear beside him and sighed, “Old comrade, this may be my last time holding you! Young master, watch closely—my time is truly limited!”

Chapter 33: Splitting Heaven Spear ()

After the elder spoke, his form seemed to solidify further. He gripped the dark spear and a supreme aura formed around him, as if he were the sole sovereign of heaven and earth. Luo Tian marveled at his power—just a fragmentary soul could radiate such dominance.

“First Form of the Splitting Heaven Spear Technique: Golden Snake’s Wild Dance!” The elder, undeterred by Luo Tian’s awe, spun his body. The spear in his hand transformed into a golden serpent, its maw wide open as it lunged forward with fangs.

“Second Form: Golden Stone Shatters! Third Form: Golden Sea Sifts Sand!” The elder shouted, thrusting two more spears.

“Hum…” The entire space turned into a sea of gold, swirling with golden spear shadows.

Luo Tian marveled repeatedly. He had never seen a technique beyond the Yellow Rank, though his Five Elements Generation Human King Seal could rival an玄-level technique. Yet now he realized these three spear forms were leagues beyond Yellow Rank techniques.

Luo Tian’s eyes fixed on the elder’s movements, fearing he might miss even a single detail.

“Fourth Form… I can’t perform it in my current state. You’ll have to grasp it yourself!” The elder’s weakened voice echoed.

“Master!” Luo Tian had completely lowered his guard now, for the elder’s form was nearly dissolving. He instinctively called out with concern.

“I have two things to ask of you. First, the Splitting Heaven Spear has lost its former might after time’s passage. I hope one day you’ll restore it to its peak glory!” The elder’s voice faded, his form growing even more ethereal, as if a breeze could scatter him.

“Secondly, when you travel across the continent in the future, be wary of any person with the surname Huang. Check if they have a black mole on their left forehead—should you find one, it may be my descendant. Please show them some care!” The elder finished, gazing tenderly at the Splitting Heaven Spear as if parting from an old friend. A gentle breeze swept through, and the elder’s form finally dissolved into this space.

Luo Tian gazed at the fading specter, a man who had never revered anyone before now feeling a surge of admiration.

He admired the elder’s devotion to the martial path, his bond with the Splitting Heaven Spear. If one could cherish a weapon so deeply, this man was undeniably worthy of respect. After years of waiting solely to ensure his Splitting Heaven Spear wouldn’t be buried in history’s river.

“Ugh…” As if sensing the elder had vanished completely, the Splitting Heaven Spear let out a mournful cry.

With the elder’s dissolution, the ninth hundred and ninety-ninth layer of space also vanished into the world. Luo Tian’s form reappeared atop the ninth hundred and ninety-ninth step.

Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei stood at the base of the Heaven-Ascending Stairs, their faces streaked with tears. Even when they saw Zhang Qi, they had no desire to confront him—because they were waiting for one person. They refused to believe Luo Tian would perish on the Heaven-Ascending Stairs.

Zhang Qi felt immense joy in his heart; his great threat had finally perished. With his cousin Zhang Daoyi watching over him in the Five Elements Sect, he would surely have everything he desired.

Lei Yong and Ji Chen also wore expressions of sorrow, unable to believe their master’s favored disciple—Luo Tian, their junior brother—would die on the Heaven-Ascending Stairs.

Meanwhile, people began to leave the base of the stairs, but all marveled at this brilliant figure who had yet to shine before perishing.

“Dead? Dead is better. I wonder if you’re the one I seek!” A black-cloaked youth stood at the base of the stairs, gazing up at the towering structure.

“Alas…” Hongyun Feng Qianyu and others sighed, exchanging glances. They secretly lamented the young man who had utterly defeated them.

“Perhaps such a genius was envied by heaven itself! Otherwise, if he lived, he would overshadow all others!” The peak masters of the Five Elements Sect also sighed.

“Hum…” A wave of energy radiated from the top of the Heaven-Ascending Stairs. Luo Tian’s form gradually emerged, a black spear standing before him. Sunlight struck the cold spear tip, emitting an intense glint.

Though it was daytime, the spear’s tip seemed like a sun, blinding people’s eyes.

“Huh? What is this? So glaring!” People followed the light and saw…

“Luo Tian!” Someone stammered, calling out. As the call spread, people kept gazing upward at Luo Tian’s slender figure. All eyes returned to the Heaven-Ascending Stairs.

“I knew you wouldn’t die so easily!” Gu Qianxue’s tears, which had just stopped, flowed again.

Luo Tian reached to lift the Splitting Heaven Spear, but it repelled him from his grasp.

“Splitting Heaven Spear, I know you cherished Master Huang’s feelings. Today, Luo Tian swears to promote your spear techniques and restore your former glory! Master Huang, I am indebted for teaching me this technique. Consider me your half-teacher. I’ve never knelt to anyone before, but today I shall bow to you—please accept this one prostration!” Luo Tian spoke, then fell to his knees, leaning forward and pressing a resounding headbutt into the ground.

“Ugh…” The Splitting Heaven Spear emitted a low hum, as if acknowledging Luo Tian or bidding farewell. It flew upward, its tip pricking Luo Tian’s wrist, staining it with a drop of blood that vanished instantly.

Luo Tian extended his hand again toward the Splitting Heaven Spear. This time, it no longer rejected him but rested firmly in his grasp.

As Luo Tian gripped the spear, he felt a connection as if it were part of his body.

Standing atop the ninth hundred and ninety-ninth step, Luo Tian held the long spear. A breeze swept through, lifting his long hair and radiating a confident aura from him.

People gazed at the radiant Luo Tian, knowing a genius was about to rise and dominate the Northern Region. If he grew strong enough, the Tianyuan Continent would surely have a place for him.

Luo Tian slowly descended the Heaven-Ascending Stairs, and wherever he went, people instinctively parted. He reached Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei.

“Are you okay?” Luo Tian smiled at them.

“Yes, fine,” Gu Qianxue replied gently.

“Sister! You…?” Gu Lei stared at Gu Qianxue’s demeanor, which was like that of a little girl. Where was her former fierce and spirited self?

“Shoo…” Gu Qianxue grabbed Gu Lei’s ear without hesitation.

“Luo Tian, congratulations on surviving! But I’ll definitely not lose to you in the second round!” Zhang Hongyun, shaking off his previous gloom, shouted at Luo Tian.

“I’ll wait for you!” Luo Tian smiled, his confidence evident in his words.

Chapter 34: Do You Have a Dream? ()

Seeing the reverent gazes around him, Luo Tian sighed inwardly: “This is what it feels like to have strength and talent. If only I had this talent back when I was at the Flying Cloud Sect… Ah…”

Luo Tian sighed, watching Ren Yong and Ji Chen approach.

“Boy, you truly are my junior brother! You’ve brought honor to us!” Ren Yong laughed, accompanied by Ji Chen in black.

Ji Chen said nothing but raised his thumb toward Luo Tian.

“Apologies for troubling the two senior brothers!” Luo Tian bowed respectfully to them.

Congratulatory voices filled his ears, though he didn’t know most of the people. Still, he smiled and responded to each one.

People marveled at Luo Tian’s abnormal physique and kind nature, praising him endlessly.

“That old man truly has good eyes!” The peak masters of the sects all sighed.

“Damn it, why did the Dan Sect take all the good prospects? I’m not happy!” Wu Ping’an of the Poison Peak grumbled.

“Then go challenge him directly! If you’re stronger, just snatch him away!” Sichuan Peak Master Si Tu Anle scoffed.

“Shoo… I’m not ready to die yet!” Hearing Si Tu Anle mention the Dan Sect’s master, he instinctively shivered at the memory of that elder’s terrifying presence. The crowd laughed.

As Luo Tian descended the Heaven-Ascending Stairs, the first round of evaluations officially concluded.

“Alright! Everyone, that’s it for today. Return to your quarters and rest. Come back tomorrow for the second round!” Kong Deming’s voice rang out.

Hearing Kong Deming, people gradually filed out of the mountain with admiration.

“Let’s go too! Senior brothers, see you tomorrow!” Luo Tian glanced at the sky and said to them.

“Right, rest well today! Tomorrow, fight hard and don’t disgrace our Dan Sect!” Ren Yong laughed.

“Hey… can Luo Tian stay a moment?” Gu Lei, having escaped from Gu Qianxue’s grip, whispered.

Gu Lei kept glancing around as if searching for someone. His eyes lit up and he ran in a direction, shouting, “Hey! You there! You—don’t run away!”

Not long after, Gu Lei dragged a body-refinement seventh-stage youth through the crowd. The youth was short and looked bitter, his face flushed with embarrassment. Gu Lei pulled him toward Luo Tian.

People were puzzled by how a body-refinement seventh-stage youth was being dragged by one of the fourth stage. Curious, they gathered around.

“Come on, what’s your name? What did you say before? Ask him if he’s my brother!” Gu Lei pointed at Luo Tian and said to the youth.

“I… I…” The youth’s face turned red, regretting his words as he stammered.

Ren Yong and Ji Chen also watched the youth with interest, unaware of their conflict.

“Didn’t you say if Luo Tian was my brother, you’d call me father? Come on, I’m right here. Say ‘father’!” Gu Lei stood proudly before the youth.

Everyone now understood, their interest piqued at how the youth would respond.

Under everyone’s gaze, the youth blushed as if bleeding. To run away? No way—Luo Tian was right there. If he tried to fight, it would be suicide! Even if he ignored Luo Tian, just one touch from Ren Yong and Ji Chen could break his small body.

Luo Tian chuckled, not expecting Gu Lei to play such a trick. Seeing the youth flustered, he recalled his own helplessness when mocked by Wang Fan at the Flying Cloud Sect.

“Enough, Gu Lei. Let him go!” Luo Tian said softly.

Gu Lei hadn’t truly wanted the youth to call him anything; he was just angry that the youth had underestimated him. He only wanted to teach a lesson. Seeing Luo Tian’s magnanimity, he waved his hand: “Alright, this time is enough. Next time, don’t underestimate others!”

Hearing Luo Tian plead for him, the youth looked grateful and bowed to Luo Tian: “I’m Dong Sansi. You can call me Dong San. I know my words were overreaching, but I still say: if you need help in the future, I’ll do my best!”

Luo Tian smiled but didn’t take it seriously. He waved his hand, signaling Dong Sansi to leave.

Dong Sansi glanced at Luo Tian again and bowed to the group before vanishing into the crowd.

“Ugh! I was the one who was magnanimous and let him go, why does he need to thank you! I’m not happy!” Gu Lei howled, trying to stop Dong Sansi but failing.

“Don’t you like it?” Gu Qianxue clenched her white hands, eyes unkind. Gu Lei’s wails resumed.

The Heaven-Ascending Stairs and the first round of evaluations for the Five Elements Sect ended amidst Gu Lei’s wails.

Luo Tian bid farewell to Ren Yong and Ji Chen again, walking down the mountain toward a inn under people’s reverent gazes.

Night…

Luo Tian and Gu Lei lay in the inn room.

“Luo Tian, do you have a dream?” Gu Lei’s voice echoed.

“Huh?” Luo Tian was surprised that Gu Lei, usually so carefree, would ask such a question.

“My dream is to become a renowned alchemist across the Tianyuan Continent, then protect my sister and father, and see my mother!” Gu Lei spoke on.

“Do you know? When I was little, my mother was taken away. Every time I and my sister asked our father about her, we saw his face show helplessness. At first, I didn’t understand. Now, I do!” Gu Lei’s voice was choked.

“I know what it is—helplessness. My sister has been training hard, hoping our father would tell her something. But every time she improved, the only thing she got was a sigh of helplessness from our father. From that moment on, I knew we might never see my mother again. But since you came, I’ve seen hope again. Luo Tian, the one thing I ask of you is: when you become renowned across the Tianyuan Continent, take me to find my mother!” Gu Lei mumbled before falling asleep.

“Dreams? I have one? If my initial dream was to defeat Li Xiuping, then now… obviously defeating him is just a matter of time. What after that? What should I do? Gu Lei has his mother to rely on, but I’m an orphan. I have no memories of my parents. What kind of dream should I have?” Luo Tian fell asleep, musing.

After a day’s exhaustion, Luo Tian had a dream—returning to his childhood, cradled in a warm embrace. Tears fell on his face, and he extended his tiny hand to wipe them away but could never reach that blurred face. All he heard was a continuous sigh.

Chapter 35: Second Round Evaluation ()

Morning, Luo Tian opened his eyes, feeling a dampness on his face. He chuckled self-deprecatingly: “It’s been a long time since I cried!”

“Hah…” Gu Lei stretched and stood up.

They both washed their faces, then stepped out of the room to find a beautiful figure standing leisurely outside. Luo Tian was momentarily stunned.

Today, Gu Qianxue wasn’t wearing her usual long emerald gown but a淡紫色 (light purple) one. Her hair was no longer piled high but let down, losing some of its sharpness and gaining a touch of softness.

“Have you had enough? Let’s go!” Gu Qianxue said softly, unaware that her eyes held a hint of triumph.

After eating some food, the three headed toward the Five Elements Sect.

Along the way, they met many people, but unlike yesterday’s anonymity, now everyone gazed at Luo Tian with reverence. Some girls even looked at him with flirtatious eyes.

Luo Tian felt awkward under their aggressive glances but soon sensed a chill from his neck.

Gu Qianxue noticed the girls’ glances and furrowed her brows, moving closer to Luo Tian as if claiming him.

Luo Tian smiled at Gu Qianxue’s childishness.

They soon reached the Five Elements Sect’s mountain gate, different from yesterday. Today, those who came for evaluations were led into the gates and into a vast open area with three platforms about hundreds of feet tall.

Today’s crowd was noticeably smaller, but Luo Tian estimated it at over a thousand people.

Not long after, Kong Deming led several outer sect disciples to the crowd of nearly a thousand. Then, more elders came from outside, emitting waves of terror.

Luo Tian was stunned by the group of nearly a hundred people, realizing even the weakest were body-refinement ninth stage. He felt deeper admiration for the Five Elements Sect’s strength.

Before he could finish being stunned, another scene made him gasp: a group of fifty people emerged from the hundred-person line.

“Bone-Refining Stage.” If seeing body-refinement ninth stage was manageable, the fifty Bone-Refining Stage people made some with weaker cultivation almost collapse.

Fifty Bone-Refining Stage individuals, even without deliberately emitting pressure, were unbearable for ordinary people.

But then, people’s hearts seemed to burst as several figures stepped forward and took their seats on the high platform—those were the peak masters of yesterday’s sects, experts at the Yuan灵 (Nascent Soul) stage.

Kong Deming was also tense, suppressing his fear as he pointed at the vast platforms: “Today’s evaluation is simple. Ten people per group, each with a disciple from the Five Elements Sect to evaluate you. If you perform well, someone will take you directly for the next round. The rest still have a chance but must start from the lowest-level disciples!”

“Shua… shua…” As Kong Deming’s words ended, nearly a hundred people stood on each platform. It was clear the first platform had about body-refinement seventh stage, the second had eighth stage, and the third had a few ninth-stage disciples.

“Those who stopped at two hundred steps yesterday go to the first platform, four hundred steps to the second, six hundred steps to the third! When you arrive, someone will issue your number card and proceed in order!” Kong Deming finished and waved his hand to signal people could move.

“Hu…” People dispersed, Gu Lei and Luo Tian said goodbye to Gu Qianxue before heading toward the second platform.

Luo Tian, Gu Qianxue, and Zhang Hongyun all headed toward the last platform.

Those who reached six hundred steps were already considered Five Elements Sect disciples, with many outstanding ones like Zhang Hongyun already pre-selected by the peak masters. The second round was just a formality, while the third was the true test.

Including Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue, only thirty people remained—these thirty were the most outstanding among this round’s disciples.

Luo Tian glanced around and found his group included Zhang Hongyun, Feng Qianyu, the black-cloaked youth, and Gu Qianxue—those who had ranked in the top five on the Heaven-Ascending Stairs yesterday.

The evaluator was Zhang Daoyi, a body-refinement ninth-stage disciple about to enter the Bone-Refining Stage.

The first to step up was Gu Qianxue, who had ranked fifth yesterday.

Zhang Daoyi saw her and felt a flicker of admiration, but it passed quickly. He knew this woman was beyond his reach.

Gu Qianxue stepped onto the platform and bowed respectfully to Zhang Daoyi: “Please be lenient, senior brother!”

“Junior sister, please fight freely!” Zhang Daoyi politely returned the bow.

“Then senior brother be ready!” Gu Qianxue said, then vanished in a blur toward Zhang Daoyi. Her fiery red fist was raised high and slammed toward him.

Zhang Daoyi, a body-refinement ninth-stage disciple about to enter Bone-Refining Stage, easily overpowered Gu Qianxue’s body-refinement fifth stage. However, he only defended without attacking.

After some time of Gu Qianxue’s attacks, her forehead was slightly sweaty and she retreated to the platform’s edge. She silently marveled at how strong body-refinement ninth stage was.

“Senior brother, be careful!” Gu Qianxue said softly, then summoned her fire and wood attributes. A red palm imbued with heat formed and flew toward Zhang Daoyi.

“Wood gives birth to fire, Great Sun Palm!” This was Gu Qianxue’s signature technique. She decided to use her final secret move, as it was just a formality.

The red palm slowly descended toward Zhang Daoyi. Zhang Daoyi didn’t dodge but simply extended a golden fist to strike it.

“Peng!”

Fireflies scattered, waves of heat radiated outward.

Gu Qianxue stood there, watching Zhang Daoyi’s single punch shatter her Great Sun Palm. Her face showed a hint of disappointment—she hadn’t expected body-refinement ninth stage to be so terrifying. Her current strength couldn’t even harm him.

“Don’t be disappointed. In a year, you’ll surpass him!” A woman’s voice echoed as she approached Gu Qianxue. Her face was gentle, looking at her with kindness.

“Respectful junior greets the elder!” Gu Qianxue bowed respectfully.

“Would you like to join my Green Wood Sect and become my disciple?” The woman smiled gently.

“Begin!” People who had finished their evaluations and were watching the spectacle all sighed.

“This!” Gu Qianxue hesitated, glancing at Luo Tian. She knew Luo Tian had joined the Dan Sect and wasn’t sure if she could be with him.

“Don’t worry, after joining the Wood Sect, you can still visit your little boyfriend anytime!” The Wood Sect’s master laughed.

“Ah!” Gu Qianxue felt as if her thoughts were guessed, her face instantly blushing. Hearing the Wood Sect master call him a little boyfriend made her want to find a hole to crawl into.

Gu Qianxue secretly glanced at Luo Tian, realizing he hadn’t heard the Wood Sect master’s words. She thought back and realized the Wood Sect master had directly imprinted her thoughts into her mind, so she sighed in relief.

Chapter 36: Each Has Their Master ()

She touched her hot cheeks, knowing the best choice was the Wood Sect. The Dan Sect had publicly announced they wouldn’t compete with other sects for disciples, so even if she wanted to join, it was impossible.

“Tianyuan City! Gu Qianxue, I pay my respects to you, Master!” Gu Qianxue hesitated slightly before kneeling and bowing.

The crowd looked with envy, especially male disciples. They heard the Wood Sect was the one with the most female disciples in the Five Elements Sect, so many wanted to join it.

“Congratulations you!” Peak masters of various sects all praised, as the Wood Sect’s master had good relations and no one challenged her.

The Wood Sect master smiled: “Good, you are now my third disciple. Come with me to the third round of evaluations!”

“Master, can we wait a little? After the second round finishes?” Gu Qianxue hesitated, her face blushing again. Her eyes unintentionally glanced toward Luo Tian.

The Wood Sect master chuckled: “Little girl! Go ahead! Seems my disciple is already taken by the Dan Sect!”

The Wood Sect master sighed, recalling his second disciple who also had a soft spot for a boy in the Dan Sect.

Gu Qianxue blushed and ran toward Luo Tian.

“Was she taken by the Wood Sect?” Luo Tian looked at Gu Qianxue approaching him and smiled. He was happy for her, thinking she was the best fit for the Wood Sect. But he felt a slight emptiness at parting from her.

“Yup!” Gu Qianxue nodded firmly, eyes showing a hint of reluctance. Though they hadn’t openly confessed their feelings, both had each other in their hearts.

“Train well. If anyone bullies you, even if it’s just a slight hurt, call me at the Dan Sect. I’ll make them suffer for you!” Luo Tian said softly.

“Hmph! Who dares bully me? They’re just tired of life!” Gu Qianxue heard Luo Tian’s words and felt a surge of sweetness. She instantly returned to her fierce self.

“Boom…” A strong tremor echoed, drawing their attention to the platform.

Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue looked toward the tremor, seeing Zhang Hongyun battling Zhang Daoyi. Intense energy waves radiated, stronger than Gu Qianxue’s Great Sun Palm by more than double.

“Zhang Hongyun used his secret move!” People watched Zhang Hongyun, who looked battered.

While Zhang Daoyi was lenient with Gu Qianxue, he wasn’t for Zhang Hongyun.

Zhang Hongyun’s white robe was covered in dust and torn in several places.

“Golden Demon Finger! Wood Emperor Fist!” Zhang Hongyun formed a finger with one hand and a fist with the other.

A green energy fist slowly formed, while a golden finger pointed forward.

Zhang Daoyi’s eyes showed slight concern. Though Zhang Hongyun was a dual-attribute talent at body-refinement seventh stage, his cultivation level was lower. But if he used techniques, Zhang Daoyi had to be careful—otherwise, he might still lose.

Zhang Daoyi summoned golden energy and formed two shields to block Zhang Hongyun’s technique.

“Crack…” A clear sound echoed, and the first shield shattered. The fist and finger paused briefly before colliding with the second shield.

“Peng…” A heavy sound echoed.

Zhang Daoyi’s face relaxed: “Junior brother, do you have any more techniques?”

“No!” Zhang Hongyun smiled and sighed at the strength of body-refinement ninth stage. But he soon regained confidence—after all, he had just joined the Five Elements Sect and was still behind this senior brother.

“Boy, would you like to become my disciple in the Golden Light Sect?” A deep voice echoed. It was the master of the Golden Light Sect.

“Respectful junior accepts!” Zhang Hongyun didn’t hesitate and immediately accepted, receiving envy from the crowd. He knelt and completed his拜师 (initiation) ceremony.

The Golden Light Sect master was confident in taking Zhang Hongyun, as the Wood Sect had already taken Gu Qianxue. Since Zhang Hongyun was a wood and gold attribute, the Wood Sect wouldn’t compete with him. Thus, he was suitable only for the Golden Light Sect.

Zhang Hongyun didn’t leave immediately but stayed before the master, watching the confrontation to see how much he differed from those ahead of him.

Feng Qianyu leaped onto the platform and bowed to Zhang Daoyi without saying a word.

“Junior brother, please!” Zhang Daoyi smiled and greeted Feng Qianyu.

Feng Qianyu didn’t speak but pushed off the ground and attacked Zhang Daoyi with an unsteady approach.

Luo Tian nodded repeatedly, appreciating Feng Qianyu’s precise angles and power. Compared to Zhang Hongyun, he was much stronger—his skill must have been honed through years of battles.

Though Feng Qianyu’s attacks were orderly, he still lagged behind Zhang Daoyi and looked more battered. This was because Zhang Daoyi had been unkind to Feng Qianyu for not even offering a greeting.

“Dual Elements Ice and Fire Palm!” Feng Qianyu finally decided to use his secret move.

Blue and red energy surged from his hands, merging into a Taijitu pattern that flew toward Zhang Daoyi.

Water and fire were naturally opposing elements. If they coexisted in one’s body, that person might not sense energy at all.

But Feng Qianyu could have both elements coexist in his body and reach body-refinement seventh stage. This showed how extraordinary he was.

Luo Tian marveled at Feng Qianyu’s strength. Even with his body-refinement sixth stage and abnormal physique, without using the Human King Seal or Splitting Heaven Spear, he wouldn’t be able to beat Feng Qianyu.

Zhang Hongyun watched Feng Qianyu with complex feelings. Among those present, no one knew him better than Zhang Hongyun. Their cities were close, so they often sparred. He knew Feng Qianyu’s training method was too harsh—this was why he, despite his arrogance, always saw Feng Qianyu as a rival.

When Feng Qianyu had surpassed him yesterday on the Heaven-Ascending Stairs, Zhang Hongyun finally realized he was now slightly behind Feng Qianyu.

The Taijitu pattern, radiating terrifying waves, flew toward Zhang Daoyi.

Zhang Daoyi’s face grew serious as he faced the pattern, finally no longer underestimating him. A body-refinement ninth-stage aura radiated from him—those familiar knew he had now become serious.

Zhang Daoyi’s hands rapidly changed, forming a golden hand that slowly emerged. He roared: “Four Directions Golden Hand!”

Chapter 37: Luo Tian Steps In ()

The golden hand slowly split into four identical energy hands, rushing toward the dual elements pattern from all directions.

“Peng!” The thunderous sound echoed through heaven and earth.

Zhang Daoyi felt his energy slightly depleted. He hadn’t expected a body-refinement seventh-stage Feng Qianyu to force him to use his technique.

Feng Qianyu still said nothing but bowed toward Zhang Daoyi.

“Boy, would you like to become my disciple in the Fire Sect?” The master of the Fire Sect, Si Tu Anle, spoke first and approached Feng Qianyu.

“He should be my disciple in the Water Moon Sect!” Before Si Tu Anle finished, Master Shui Man Tian of the Water Sect spoke loudly.

“Hiss!” A gasp echoed. Two sect masters both invited Feng Qianyu, showing how extraordinary he was.

Actually, it wasn’t because Feng Qianyu was so extraordinary but because no one else remained! There were only Luo Tian and the black-cloaked youth left. Luo Tian had already been pre-selected by the Dan Sect, and the black-cloaked youth’s energy clearly wasn’t suitable for either of them.

Feng Qianyu stood stunned, unsure how to choose.

The two sect masters began arguing and even escalated to the point of fighting, their wings spread wide before vanishing from sight. Feng Qianyu stood alone, his mouth twitching.

“Next: Yang Huanyu!” Zhang Daoyi’s voice echoed, and he took a pill from his sleeve, swallowing it. His depleted energy instantly returned to peak condition.

People marveled at the Five Elements Sect’s depth, having a pill that could instantly restore energy.

“Ah, so his name is Yang Huanyu!” Luo Tian muttered the name, recalling where he had seen him but still couldn’t remember.

“Shua…” Yang Huanyu’s form appeared on the platform, bowing like Feng Qianyu.

Zhang Daoyi grew even more annoyed, thinking: “Hmph, all of you act so arrogant. Though you are geniuses, you’re not yet! Let me teach you what respect for elders means today!”

But before he could react, Yang Huanyu’s form was already at Zhang Daoyi’s front. A fist with gray energy slammed toward him.

Zhang Daoyi sneered at Yang Huanyu’s overconfidence, bending his body and sending a golden fist forward to meet it.

“Peng…” Another strong wave echoed, stunning the crowd. From Gu Qianxue onward, these four people were each stronger than their level, far surpassing others of the same stage. If it were a body-refinement eighth-stage person, they might have struggled against Zhang Hongyun.

Zhang Daoyi took two steps back, his face full of shock—how could he be pushed back by a body-refinement seventh-stage person? Though the opponent had the first move and was more battered, he was about to enter the Bone-Refining Stage.

“This kid is really strong!” Luo Tian thought, knowing even if he used all his tricks, he wouldn’t be able to beat Yang Huanyu.

“I’ve got him!” Wu Ping’an of the Poison Sect’s face showed determination.

“Hmph, old poison guy, it’s not decided yet who he’ll join! Let’s see whose charisma wins!” A discordant voice echoed. The earth sect master, Huang Jingshan, who had been silent, finally spoke.

“Old Huang, are you still competing with me?” Wu Ping’an frowned slightly, asking.

“Yes, they’ve all competed. I haven’t yet, so I must!” Huang Jingshan chuckled.

“I owe you a favor—let me give him to you, okay?” Wu Ping’an’s eyes showed a hint of pleading. He had never taken a disciple before, spending years studying poisons and being reclusive. He had never asked for anything but now, seeing his ideal disciple, he opened his mouth to beg.

“Alas… old poison guy, it’s not that I don’t give you this face. But you know the situation in my Thick Earth Sect. Now, no one is lacking talent—only my Thick Earth Sect has nothing to show! This time, I can’t let it go!” Huang Jingshan said reluctantly, his eyes revealing an indiscernible expression.

“Boom…” A heavy sound echoed, interrupting their conversation.
