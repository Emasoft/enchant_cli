The Sky Corpse Sect differs from Tianyuan Continent and Xiangu Continent. On Tianyuan, cultivators harness Primordial Power, which governs creation, whereas the Sky Corpse Sect specializes in Destruction Power, devoted to annihilation and devastation.

Thus, all of Yang Huanyu's direct disciples within the Sky Corpse Sect are war enthusiasts, inherently bloodthirsty.

Upon hearing Yang Huanyu's words, thousands of disciples displayed grotesque smiles on their faces, roaring as they rushed out of the hall. Their eyes glowed with bloodlust, fixated on the dense crowd below Tianyuan Continent.

"Half-Realm Lord, thousands of them!" Observing the thousands emerging from the hall, Yāo Zūn and others bore solemn expressions.

Though their side numbered a million, only three to four thousand were at the Half-Realm Lord stage. Though superior in numbers, Yāo Zūn and his companions estimated their overall strength would be roughly equal. Moreover, Destruction Power countered Primordial Power—this battle's outcome remained uncertain.

Reflecting on this, Tianyuan cultivators secretly thanked their fortune; a month ago, the continent's interconnection had elevated their collective strength. Had this not occurred, Tianyuan would have surely suffered a crushing defeat.

"Only two days remain—deploy them all!" Yang Huanyu struck his chest, and more black figures continuously emerged from the Sky Corpse Sect's hall. Disciples at the Yuanling, Huagǔ, and even Lianti stages followed thousands of elites. Their eyes burned crimson, radiating fervent intensity as they charged toward the Sky Corpse Continent's forces.

These individuals comprised either native warriors of the Western Regions, brainwashed by Yang Huanyu's methods, or core sect disciples—yet all were expendables, pawns for Yang Huanyu and the thousands of Half-Realm Lords above.

"Sky Yuan disciples, kill!" Seeing the Sky Corpse Sect's full-scale assault, the three Realm Lords commanded their million disciples to launch a final offensive.

An early battle was precisely what the three Realm Lords desired; they feared Yang Huanyu's hidden strategies by moonrise.

"Kill..." After a day of respite, Yuanling and Huagǔ stage cultivators obeyed the three Realm Lords' orders, re-entering the battlefield. Millions of Lianti stage disciples also roared, charging into combat. They knew Tianyuan needed them; Yuanling and Huagǔ disciples had been exhausted by the skeleton army, lacking numerical superiority.

They relied on Lianti stage disciples to overwhelm opponents. Fortunately, Jiang Nanxuan, a ninth-tier array master, had taught them an array. Every million disciples formed a grand formation, its power rivaling several Jipao stage masters. The proverb "a multitude of ants can devour an elephant" manifested vividly on Tianyuan's side.

The Western Regions, once silent, transformed into a meat grinder, its brutality surpassing prior battles. Countless souls vanished daily, swallowed by the heavens and earth.

With the final battle ignited, Tianyuan Continent descended into chaos. Disciples across the continent trembled upon hearing the news—how could such a battlefield exist within their realm?

The rumor spread across Tianyuan, even reaching the humble fishing village of Beihai. All sects fought for their continent's survival.

"Kill! Why shouldn't we fight? We'll die anyway!" Bloodthirsty independent cultivators roared, rushing toward the Western Regions.

...

"Something's wrong! Yichen, your hand seal is incorrect! Yan'er, this Wang King Seal should be formed thus!" In a dilapidated courtyard of Beihai Fishing Village, an aged voice echoed.

Luotian's face bore solemnity as he corrected Dong Yichen and Dong Yan'er's cultivation techniques.

In two days, the siblings reached the Lianti stage, earning Luotian and Xiang Tianming's satisfaction. Their enthusiasm during lessons surpassed even Xiang Tianming's brutal training methods, making Luotian's teachings seem gentler.

Yet today, Dong Yichen appeared distracted; his Wang King Seal repeatedly faltered.

"Yichen, what's troubling you?" Luotian noticed Yichen's unease and inquired.

"Master, I heard all Tianyuan disciples have marched to the Western Regions. Even Wateryou Town's cultivators rushed there in outrage! Why haven't you and Master Xiang gone? With your strength..." Yichen's face held curiosity, cautiously observing Luotian.

Upon hearing this, Luotian's body trembled, his face etched with bitterness. He thought of his master, brothers, and friends.

"It's not yet time. I'm seeking strength. As for Master Xiang, he must have his reasons," Luotian sighed, gently patting Yichen's head.

After these days together, Luotian understood Xiang Tianming's nature—indifferent to others' plight. Even if all Tianyuan disciples perished, it meant nothing to him. This puzzled Luotian, yet he refrained from probing Xiang's motives.

"But Master, I wish to go! As a Tianyuan disciple, I must protect it!" Yichen's face bore longing.

"Yes, Master! I want to go too!" Dong Yan'er, eager and naive, tugged Luotian's sleeve.

"Impossible..." Luotian's face darkened, an unprecedented sternness in his gaze. The Western Regions' battlefield was merciless; Lianti stage disciples were mere insects. Yichen and Yan'er would perish in an instant.

Luotian relied on them to inherit his teachings. As children, he couldn't bear watching them die.

Seeing Luotian's severity, Yichen's face fell in disappointment; Yan'er remained indifferent, driven by curiosity and reliance on her brother.

Observing Yichen's despair, Luotian's gaze turned resolute: "I'll show you what a battlefield is."

Yichen lifted his head, meeting Luotian's eyes—then froze, lifeless.

Chapter 727: The Hope of Full Recovery

Chapter 727: The Hope of Full Recovery

Dong Yichen stood motionless, his eyes clouded with confusion. Dong Yan'er gazed curiously at her brother and master's mutual stare, sweat trickling down Yichen's face as fear gripped him.

Time passed slowly. After about a quarter-hour, Luotian withdrew his gaze, exhaustion etched on his face: "Did you sense the battlefield's aura?"

Yichen collapsed, gasping heavily, replaying the harrowing vision. Luotian had imprinted a memory of his battle against the Sky Corpse Sect in Yichen's mind via spiritual awareness.

Yichen, raised in comfort, had never faced true peril—his greatest turmoil was a previous ruckus at Wateryou Town. He'd never witnessed death, let alone endure such horrors. Luotian's spiritual power conjured an experience so vivid it felt real.

"Vomit..." Yichen paled, retching as he stared at Luotian.

"Still want to go? That was merely a battle of twenty thousand. The Western Regions' war involves nearly seventy percent of Tianyuan's disciples—hundreds of times more. At your Lianti stage, even a touch would kill you!" Luotian's face hardened.

"Master! I want to see too!" Yan'er eagerly approached, eager to witness.

Luotian affectionately patted her head: "Little girl, go away!"

"Good. Focus on cultivation. When you believe you can protect your sister, then go out and explore. I hope that day comes," Luotian sighed, his aged eyes brimming with regret.

"Why are you regretful, Master?" Yichen noticed Luotian's sorrow.

Luotian said nothing; Xiang Tianming's figure emerged before them, causing Yan'er to shrink behind Luotian.

"Bad master! You just fed us this morning, why again?" Yan'er eyed Xiang Tianming warily.

"Respected elder!" Luotian bowed, though his age made him appear older than Xiang Tianming, their hierarchy remained unchanged.

"Ah, found a solution?" Xiang Tianming smiled, addressing Luotian before eyeing Yan'er and Yichen: "Who let you slack off? Get back to training! I have matters to discuss with your master!" Xiang Tianming adopted a strict demeanor.

"Yes!" Yan'er nodded, joyfully fleeing like avoiding a plague, sitting cross-legged while stealing glances at Luotian and Xiang Tianming.

Yichen, naturally obedient to his teacher, sat before his sister, spiritual energy gathering around them.

"Are you going to the Western Regions?" Xiang Tianming directly asked Luotian.

Luotian nodded; with only one day until moonrise, though lacking spiritual energy, his body and spirit were at Realm Lord level—capable of matching a Jipao peak disciple.

"Ah, don't go. I'll protect you. Bring your family and friends here; I'll take you somewhere safe, avoiding this catastrophe!" Xiang Tianming smiled confidently.

"North Sea?" Luotian sighed, gazing at the turbulent North Sea through space.

Upon hearing this, Xiang Tianming's body trembled slightly, a smile forming: "Correct. You seem older, but your mind remains sharp!"

"No! The North Sea is a good refuge, yet it's not land. I can't abandon those connected to me!" Luotian shook his head.

After days of coexistence, Luotian knew Xiang Tianming was the elder from Eastern Region's inn. Two times, Xiang had chosen to stay near the North Sea—Luotian deduced he was the North Sea's ruler.

If Xiang's plan materialized, evacuating Yùlíng Sect's Ice Island and Wuxing Sect would devastate Tianyuan. Moreover, many were familiar to Luotian—like Chen Changsheng—and the凶兽 in Dahan Forest.

The North Sea might escape Sky Corpse Sect's wrath, but Luotian couldn't abandon those he cared for. He refused to let friends die.

Another critical factor: Chen Yunting's other soul fragment remained with Yang Huanyu; Luotian couldn't ignore this.

Seeing Luotian's refusal, Xiang Tianming wore a knowing smile: "Knew you'd refuse. We have a connection, though each meeting leaves me in poor spirits. Yet these days, I've pondered a way to heal you!"

"Ah?" Luotian's face lit up, his eyes filled with excitement as he gazed at Xiang Tianming.

Luotian knew his state; Xiang's words implied a method to restore him.

"Don't get excited yet—I'm not certain, but I'll try!" Xiang Tianming bit his lip, as if cutting into himself, his eyes showing regret.

"Respected elder, if I recover, my gratitude will be eternal!" Luotian bowed respectfully.

"You've guessed my identity. Correct, I am the North Sea's ruler—akin to the dragon in your Northern Region's Dahan Forest. To restore your strength, you must enter a secluded place in the North Sea—perhaps it holds your fortune. However, it's peculiar; even I face different challenges each time, once nearly trapped. Are you certain to go?" Xiang Tianming's gaze held amusement.

"Go!" Luotian hesitated not, recalling his current state—though possessing some strength, it was insufficient. If he regained Realm Lord status, with the Book of Epochs stripped, he'd fear no previous Wàngyuè Elder.

A Realm Lord and a body at that level differed by ten thousand miles. Moreover, Luotian refused to accept his fate; he had much left undone, many people—how could he abandon them? Even if it meant risk.

Yet after pondering, Luotian sighed deeply: "Forget it. The moon will rise in two days. If I choose to recover, and Tianyuan fails, I'll miss my family's final farewell—death would be regretful!"

"Kid, don't worry. I've prepared everything. Tonight, you'll be transported to the North Sea's depths. I guarantee your emergence won't exceed two days. Entering the underwater palace, no one dares mistreat you," Xiang Tianming smiled, placing a blue, icy token in Luotian's hand.

Luotian felt an icy chill upon touching it, clearing his mind.

"Water Dragon Scales?" Luotian recognized the token's material upon seeing it.

"Correct, kid. You have sharp eyes. This is indeed Water Dragon Scales. The guardians of this secluded place are the Water Dragons. They're stubborn; even I've barely subdued them. So, avoid conflicts with these eels!" Xiang Tianming warned.

Hearing this, Luotian felt reassured but recalled his past with Chen Zhanbiao eating Water Dragon meat. Though the Water Dragon Bow returned to the Northern Region with his storage ring, consuming Water Dragon flesh had caused trouble.

Luotian dared not conceal this, his face showing embarrassment as he recounted the incident to Xiang Tianming.

"What? That dragon was punished, sent to the deep waters—yet your mother killed it? You ate it?" Xiang Tianming's voice boomed, startling Yichen and Yan'er.

"Trouble! That dragon was punished; it was sent to the deep waters. Yet your mother killed it, and you ate it—this is problematic!" Xiang Tianming's face bore contemplation.

"Though punished, it was still a Water Dragon. Its death and your consumption left a Water Dragon aura—this insulted the dragon clan's pride."

"Though these eels aren't pure dragons, they possess dragon arrogance. If you descend, they'll surely retaliate. Even I can't intervene; if I favor you too much, other sea beasts would feel unfair," Xiang Tianming mused, stroking his beard.

Three thousand-word chapter.

Chapter 728: Entering the North Sea

Chapter 728: Entering the North Sea

Tianyuan Continent's vast North Sea, nearly equivalent to a domain, was entirely submerged in water with no land. Like Dahan Forest, it teemed with凶兽, its numbers surpassing those in Dahan due to its size.

However, sea beasts had a fatal flaw: upon reaching land, their strength halved or worse. Thus, none dared venture ashore—dying at the hands of weaker humans was a regrettable fate.

The North Sea's resources were abundant; sea beasts thrived here, making them reluctant to leave for land.

A sacred place existed within the North Sea: the Dragon Palace, founded by a dragon elder. Over time, it unified the entire North Sea, subjugating all凶兽 under its command.

At this moment, two aged figures appeared before the massive Dragon Palace, their faces etched with沧桑. One old man, wrinkled and aged, gazed in awe at the colossal crystal palace.

"Wow, impressed? Never seen one before?" Xiang Tianming boasted to Luotian.

Luotian nodded slightly, the immense pressure at the North Sea's depths making him uneasy. Yet two young guards at the palace, both at the Jipao stage, showed no discomfort.

"Respect the Palace Lord!" The two youths bowed respectfully to Xiang Tianming.

"Good, guard well," Xiang Tianming nodded, leading Luotian into the grand crystal palace.

Under the respectful gazes of aquatic beasts, Xiang Tianming guided Luotian through the crowd into a hall.

As they sat, Xiang Tianming called out: "Elders, I'm back. Come here!"

Luotian sat silently, sighing at the North Sea's might—capable of rivaling the entire Northern Region, perhaps even surpassing it.

Earlier, standing outside the palace, Luotian had extended his spiritual awareness to survey a hundred miles. Even within this radius, there were tens of thousands of beasts at the Yuanling stage—this was just the palace's vicinity.

How vast was the North Sea? Luotian dared not imagine. Such a power, if unleashed on Tianyuan, would cause chaos.

"Buzz..." A ripple spread; elders appeared before Luotian's eyes, their faces respectful.

Yet Luotian noticed some were genuinely respectful, others feigned it—some elders' eyes held disdain. Among them, a few youths bore hatred.

"Palace Lord, what brings you here?" An elder asked, gazing at Xiang Tianming.

Others wore confusion—Xiang Tianming rarely appeared.

Their gazes shifted to Luotian, hostility in their eyes.

"Nothing. This is my friend; he wishes to borrow our North Sea's Ancestral Dragon Tomb. I summoned you to inform you beforehand," Xiang Tianming shrugged, his eyes gleaming with intensity.

"Boom..." Upon hearing this, the crowd erupted in murmurs.

"No! The Ancestral Dragon Tomb is our Water Dragon clan's sacred site—how can an outsider, even a human, enter?" A voice echoed from the crowd.

"Yes! Palace Lord, you once promised it opens every thousand years—why now break your word?" Other elders joined the first, their voices echoing like dragon roars.

"Disagree!"
"Palace Lord, be cautious!" More voices rose, their hostility palpable.

Xiang Tianming said nothing, scanning the crowd with a smile, waiting for them to quiet.

After an hour of uproar, one-third supported the elder, while two-thirds remained neutral.

"Chen Long, you've gathered many supporters in my absence," Xiang Tianming smiled, patting his seat.

"Subservient!" The elder replied softly but straightened, pride in his eyes—clearly agreeing with Xiang Tianming.

"Boom..." Suddenly, a gray barrier encircled the hall. The elder, Chen Long, transformed into blood mist, staining the crystal palace's floor red.

Blood surged outward, even dyeing nearby people's robes. Yet Chen Long didn't utter a sound.

"What..." The crowd fell silent.

"Chen Long, accused of plotting against me—my execution is justified. Any objections?" Xiang Tianming's voice echoed, cold and commanding.

"No... no..." Those who supported Chen Long trembled, especially the youths whose eyes burned with fury.

Chen Long was a Half-Realm Lord in the North Sea—yet Xiang Tianming killed him instantly, leaving none to protest.

"What? I declare the Ancestral Dragon Tomb open—what's your stance?" Xiang Tianming ignored the youths' anger.

Silence followed. The neutral group smiled, bowing: "We support the Palace Lord's decision! The Ancestral Dragon Tomb belongs to all North Sea, and since it's the Palace Lord's, he decides!"

Xiang Tianming nodded in satisfaction, gazing at Luotian.

Luotian observed silently; before coming, Xiang Tianming had warned him: the North Sea was a hierarchy—big fish eat small.

Water Dragon clan held significant power, but Xiang Tianming's Realm Lord status prevented them from seizing control.

Unbeknownst to Luotian, the North Sea had once belonged entirely to Water Dragons. Though mighty, their power waned over time—especially after the Dragon Ancestor's death.

Xiang Tianming achieved Realm Lord status, seizing control of the Dragon Palace. Other clans had no power against a Realm Lord.

"Palace Lord, the Ancestral Dragon Tomb is perilous. I suggest sending our Water Dragon clan's young disciples to accompany your friend—first, to protect him; second, since we're dragons, our chances of aiding him are greater," another elder smiled, addressing Xiang Tianming.

Xiang Tianming's brow furrowed; he discerned the elder's intent—likely to kill Luotian in the Tomb to hurt him.

"Scared?" Xiang Tianming's voice echoed in Luotian's mind, prompting a smile.

Hearing this, Luotian shook his head; his spiritual awareness conveyed: "Can I kill them?"

"Allowed, but after exiting the Tomb, you'll be hunted by Water Dragons. Prepare yourself," Xiang Tianming smiled, their exchange occurring under everyone's watchful eyes.

"Good. Since your intentions are kind, I can't refuse," Xiang Tianming smiled, addressing the elder.

Hearing this, the crowd gasped—gazing at Luotian, they knew Water Dragons' meaning. None expected Xiang Tianming to agree; they pitied Luotian.

These people were at least Jipao peak—feeling Luotian's abnormality, no spiritual energy, yet his body was strong. How strong? They didn't know.

Yet even so, could he match凶兽—especially Water Dragons? And remember, this was underwater, granting sea beasts combat advantages.

"Then I'll trouble you," Luotian's aged voice echoed, causing further murmurs.

Even the elder who proposed this hadn't expected Xiang Tianming and his friend to accept—his body trembled, then smiled.

"Chen Qing, Chen Bei, Chen Hai—accompany this elder. Ensure his safety!" The elder smiled broadly, emphasizing the word "safety."

Apologies, everyone. Starting today, I'll post three thousand-word chapters for several days. The editor requires stockpiling; assuming no recommendation success, this book may end here. Originally planned to conclude these days, but it's my last chance—apologies.

Chapter 729: Ancestral Dragon Tomb

Chapter 729: Ancestral Dragon Tomb

Three youths stood before the elder, their faces brimming with arrogance. Their gazes fell on Luotian, disdain in their eyes.

Upon hearing the elder's names, the crowd's gazes turned more pitiful—these three were Water Dragon clan's young elites, at Jipao peak. Chen Hai had even grasped a fragment of Primordial Power.

To them, Xiang Tianming's accompanying elder was doomed.

Luotian observed the three youths, nodding inwardly—their strength was commendable, and their bodies were formidable.

"Though in poor condition, I fear no one," Luotian mused, gazing at the three with a serene expression.

"Thank you for your help, little ones!" Luotian patted their heads as if comforting grandchildren, causing the crowd's mouths to twitch.

"Crack..." The three youths' faces darkened, their fists clenching with a crunch.

Though Xiang Tianming was present, they restrained themselves, silently comforting: "He's already dead; don't argue with a corpse!"

"Ah, these little ones are truly talented. At such an age, reaching this level—this old man feels ashamed," Luotian continued patting their heads, his smile more tender.

"Perhaps we should form a bond? Master Xiang, what do you think?" Luotian ignored the crowd's twitching mouths, winking at Xiang Tianming.

"You're too old; we dare not be so bold!" Chen Hai's face was as dark as a storm, subtly dodging Luotian's hand. His body shivered at the withered palm.

"Such a polite youth—your respect for elders is rare," Luotian smiled, addressing the three.

"Crack..." A fissure formed beneath their feet; their faces flushed red, clearly furious.

"Ha! Elder Luotian, you're truly perceptive—these three are the North Sea's most promising youths!"

"Why linger? To have Elder Luotian as your grandfather is a blessing!" Xiang Tianming smiled, addressing the three.

"Gasps..." The crowd's faces bore shock—especially neutrals who now sneered.

"To have three proud dragons acknowledge a human as grandfather—that's more painful than death!" They mused.

All Water Dragons glared at Luotian and Xiang Tianming, their faces filled with anger.

"Better to die than be insulted!" Chen Hai's thoughts roared, fists clenching. Their unstable aura threatened to erupt if Luotian spoke another word.

"Good grandson, are you too excited to speak? Don't be upset—just kneel and pay respects!" Luotian, seeing the three on the verge of explosion, added fuel to their fire.

"Hmph! If you want to kill me, let me profit first. If you truly attack, Master Xiang will eliminate you—saving me effort!" Luotian inwardly sneered, patting his body as if seeking a gift.

"Boom..." The elder who named the three stepped forward, his aura pressing their fists down.

"You three still gawk? Obey Elder Luotian's order! To have a connection with the Palace Lord, this elder must be a great power. This is your fortune!" The elder smiled, but his heart brimmed with killing intent.

Today, if other Water Dragon youths had been chosen, he'd have risked everything to kill Luotian. But for Chen Hai's trio, he couldn't—neither the Water Dragons nor himself could bear their loss.

"Grandfather!" Chen Hai's trio gritted their teeth, gazing at the elder in confusion.

"Rebellious scum! Kneel!" The elder kicked them to the ground, shouting.

Seeing his grandfather's true anger, the trio's faces darkened; their chests heaved as they bowed to Luotian, shouting in unison: "Grandfather!"

"Ah... good grandsons... good grandsons..." Luotian smiled, patting their heads and helping them up.

The surrounding crowd wore disdainful expressions, murmuring: "Hmph, where's your pride? Why did you lose it upon meeting Xiang Tianming?"

Xiang Tianming smiled, allowing Luotian's antics and even tolerating his "Master Xiang" address.

"Time is short—let's go," Xiang Tianming reminded Luotian, signaling readiness.

Luotian nodded, indicating they could proceed.

"Let your new grandsons lead us," Xiang Tianming emphasized "grandson" sarcastically.

"Roar..." Chen Hai's trio growled, no longer arguing. Upon hearing "grandson," their hearts ached.

They also wished to enter the Ancestral Dragon Tomb swiftly, ending this profit-seeking old man. They'd planned how to torment and kill him.

Three massive dragon bodies filled the hall—Water Dragons, resembling those Luotian had seen before. Yet their colors were deeper than the one his mother gifted him.

"Let's go. You're such a good grandson! So filial, knowing my legs are weak!" Luotian leapt onto Chen Hai's back, smiling.

Others also jumped onto the three dragons' bodies.

"Roar..." Dragon roars echoed; Chen Hai's trio transformed into three blue lights, vanishing. The immense pressure of the sea didn't hinder them.

Due to Luotian's "grandson" remarks, they pushed their speed to the limit. In less than thirty breaths, they reached their destination.
