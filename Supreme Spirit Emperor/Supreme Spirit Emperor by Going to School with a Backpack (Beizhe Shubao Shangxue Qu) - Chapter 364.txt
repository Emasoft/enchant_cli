“Ah... You deserve death!” cried the immortal clan’s epoch peak powerhouse, his face contorted with madness as he surged forward, radiating a torrent of killing intent.

“Ha! You’ve truly forgotten my existence!” The gray soul, radiating immense pressure, intercepted the immortal clan’s epoch peak powerhouse. His eyes gleamed with arrogance; Gu Leikang seemed transformed, no longer the meek figure he had been before Luo Tian. His aura was formidable.

“Get out…!” The gray-clad elder, his body wreathed in ashen qi, glared at Gu Leikang, his eyes burning with murder. Had it not been for Gu Leikang’s interception, he would have had time to intercept Luo Tian when he killed the immortal clan’s Ming Chen.

“Let me leave? What are you, anyway? When I ruled the heavens with might, you were still nursing!” Even in his soul form, Gu Leikang showed no fear. A massive gray soul hand凝聚ed, colliding with the immortal clan’s elder.

“Boom…!” Terrifying waves erupted, sweeping outward in invisible gusts that swallowed vast stretches of starry space.

“A soul?” People gazed at Gu Leikang, who clashed with the immortal clan’s epoch peak powerhouse, their eyes wide with disbelief.

“How could Luo Tian obtain such a soul? It’s so powerful—facing an epoch peak, it doesn’t falter!” Long Jie and others frowned, unaware Luo Tian possessed such a hidden ace.

“The soul is the one thing our immortal clan fears most!”

“Ming Wang’s Devouring Heaven!” The immortal clan’s epoch peak powerhouse’s eyes turned icy. His hands moved, and a colossal maw rose from the elder’s back, its suction force pulling Gu Leikang toward it.

“Damn!” Gu Leikang’s eyes widened in fear as his body was drawn uncontrollably into the maw.

“Master of Soul Sealing, I can’t hold on!” Gu Leikang roared, his gaze locking onto Luo Tian before his body trembled.

“Roar…” A low growl echoed across the arena as Luo Tian’s face paled, sweat dripping from his brow. His body trembled, bent under the strain.

“What’s happening?” People stared at Luo Tian’s agonized expression, baffled by the sudden shift.

“Curse Divine Pill!” Luo Tian felt a streak of ashen qi on his soul, his mind reeling. He recalled the Curse Divine Pill he had taken from the Star Moon Clan. The curse’s power now coursed through his entire body.

“It’s a curse! Our蛮族’s curse—ah, I remember now! He took the Curse Divine Pill!” Manhun stood there, his voice hoarse.

“Ah! I see now! Luo Tian cannot attack the ancient clans; if he does, he’ll suffer a curse’s backlash!” A clan prodigy’s face lit with understanding as he gazed at Luo Tian, who writhed in agony. He then grinned triumphantly.

“Damn!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly, his blood roared skyward as six reincarnated immortal bodies activated to counter the curse.

Last time, he had relied on the arrival of the Decline Epoch to侥幸解除 three curses. The previous middle-aged man from the Celestial Angle Clan had died at Long Jie’s hands, so the curse hadn’t erupted. Now, after killing Ming Chen, the accumulated curse had finally manifested. Time had passed too long; Luo Tian had even forgotten about this hidden danger within him.

“Die!” The immortal clan’s epoch peak powerhouse sneered, his hands moving to drive the maw toward Gu Leikang. At the same time, he闪身 forward, rushing at Luo Tian.

“Freezing Three Thousand Miles!” As the immortal clan’s epoch peak powerhouse moved, a surge of cold air erupted in the void, enveloping the starry space. Xuanbing Elder appeared before Luo Tian, grabbing Gu Leikang’s soul and pulling him to safety. They vanished from the spot, reappearing before Long Jie’s group.

“Is that the pig from Seven Star Island?” The immortal clan’s epoch peak powerhouse, hindered by Xuanbing Elder, lost his target, his face dark.

“Backyard squabbles—do you dare interfere with an epoch peak?” Xuanbing Elder’s voice was icy as he addressed the immortal clan elder.

Xuanbing Elder had remained hidden, preventing casualties in the Four Sacred Star Domains. Now that Luo Tian was in danger, he could no longer stay passive and intervened to save him.

“Luo Tian!” Long Jie’s group quickly surrounded Luo Tian, their eyes filled with concern. They hadn’t expected the situation to turn so drastically.

“I’m fine!” Luo Tian’s face was pale, but he had finally repelled the immense curse. His current cultivation no longer matched his earlier epoch initial stage, so resisting the curse was easier now. Previously, it had been too sudden, leaving him unprepared.

After some time adapting, Luo Tian finally repelled the curse. Yet he knew he must be cautious now. One curse was manageable, but if more emerged, even his current epoch late stage might not survive.

“Hand him over!” The immortal clan elder’s face darkened as he glared at Xuanbing Elder, his eyes burning with murderous intent.

“Leave!” Xuanbing Elder countered fiercely. Though the human clan was weak, he still dared not yield to an immortal clan member.

“Saying it’s a youth’s fight, yet you interfere—do you have any shame?” Xuanbing Elder spoke, as the sole epoch peak of the human clan. He must now show strength to deter the ancient clans.

“You’re seeking death!” The immortal clan elder’s voice was cold as he locked eyes with Xuanbing Elder.

“Enough—let them continue!” Just as the immortal clan elder prepared to fight Xuanbing Elder, a voice echoed from the void. The immortal clan elder’s face darkened.

“Since it’s not your kin who died, you’re fine!” The elder spoke to the void, his voice laced with resentment.

“You wish to fight? Then go—no one will stop you!” The void echoed with cold snickers before falling silent.

“Damn it!” The elder’s face darkened. Though the immortal clan was strong, he didn’t want to fight alone against the human clan, letting other clans profit.

“Wait for me!” The elder gritted his teeth before his eyes flashed with coldness and he vanished into the void.

“Continue!” A voice from the void commanded, its tone authoritative—clearly a powerhouse.

Xuanbing Elder’s face was grim; he ignored the immortal clan elder’s departure, his gaze scanning the void. He knew many ancient clans’ powerhouses were hidden there.

“Luo Tian, come out—let’s fight!” Qi Zi’ang stepped onto the arena, his eyes wild. He knew Luo Tian had been cursed, so his strength would drop—this was his chance for revenge.

“Qi Zi’ang, go back and rest! Let me handle Luo Tian!” Others also stepped onto the arena, their eyes taunting as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“Do you think the human clan has only one Luo Tian?” The human clan erupted in a clamor, their young prodigies’ eyes burning with fierce battle spirit.

“Hmph! You’re only strong now. If Luo Tian had fought, you’d all lack the guts!” Diao Dezhu and others sneered at the clan prodigies, their voices dripping with mockery.

“Luo Tian, are you truly too afraid to come up?” The clan prodigies ignored the mockery, their eyes locking onto Luo Tian.

“Do you think the human clan has no one?” A gray figure leapt onto the arena, his eyes mocking as he faced the clan prodigies.

“Zhu Ge Dynasty?” People cheered upon seeing Zhu Ge Huangchao step onto the arena. To them, though he wasn’t as strong as Luo Tian, he was still one of the top prodigies in the Nine Domains.

“I have no interest! What about you?” Fan Jingyu glanced at Zhu Ge Huangchao, then snorted dismissively. The only human clan prodigy he respected was the Nine Body Types; he regarded Zhu Ge Huangchao and his group with disdain.

“Neither do I! Let the Nine Body Types come forward—your kind isn’t worthy!” The clan prodigies exchanged glances, their eyes filled with mockery.

“You!” Zhu Ge Huangchao’s face darkened—being ignored like this enraged him. He had accepted he was inferior to Sun Miechen, but being insulted like this was unbearable.

“My brother is the Primordial Body—kill me, and he’ll avenge me!” Zhu Ge Huangchao spoke coldly, his gaze scanning the clan prodigies.

“Ah? Then kill him!” The clan prodigies exchanged glances before extending their hands.

“Rock, Scissors, Paper!” They even played a childish game in front of Zhu Ge Huangchao to decide who would fight.

“Did you plan this together?” Qi Zi’ang clenched his fists, watching their hands with impatience.

“They’re not worth my effort!” Fan Jingyu and others smiled, then leapt off the arena. Their eyes scanned the human clan, lingering on Sun Miechen and others.

“Damn it!” Zhu Ge Huangchao was enraged by their disregard. Their attitude toward him was a stark contrast to how they treated Luo Tian, which he couldn’t bear.

A surge of ashen qi radiated from Zhu Ge Huangchao’s body as he闪身 forward, rushing toward Qi Zi’ang on the arena.

“Then I’ll kill you first, then your brother!” Qi Zi’ang regained his confidence. Besides Luo Tian, he feared no one in the human clan.

“Boom…!” His massive body expanded, transforming into a black qilin. His thick limbs slammed onto the arena, his colossal form rising skyward as he stomped toward Zhu Ge Huangchao.

“Kill!” Zhu Ge Huangchao’s face hardened as he punched forward.

“Boom…” The arena sank three inches; Zhu Ge Huangchao’s body bent under the collision with Qi Zi’ang’s massive form.

“Good strength, but still too weak!” Qi Zi’ang stepped forward again, pressing down on Zhu Ge Huangchao. His head unleashed black lightning, striking toward Zhu Ge Huangchao.

“Chaos-born Green Thunder!” A streak of green lightning emerged from the gray chaos, colliding with the black lightning. The arena was engulfed in wild energy.

“Zhu Ge, take your brother out! He’s no match for the qilin!” Luo Tian shook his head. He knew Qi Zi’ang’s strength and Zhu Ge Huangchao’s, so he doubted the latter.

“Wait a bit longer!” Zhu Ge’s face showed his brother’s disadvantage, but he knew his brother’s pride and resentment. He planned to intervene when Zhu Ge Huangchao could no longer endure.

“Let’s not waste time!” Fan Jingyu and others, seeing Zhu Ge Huangchao crushed by Qi Zi’ang, grew impatient. Their eyes scanned Sun Miechen’s group before their auras surged skyward.

“Human clan, don’t waste time—come out!” They leapt into the air, shouting toward the human clan.

“Good!” Sun Miechen’s face burned with fierce battle spirit. He hadn’t fought since the beginning, but now Luo Tian couldn’t continue, so they had to shoulder this.

“Soul Clan’s Sun Miechen?” The clan prodigies’ eyes lit up upon seeing Sun Miechen finally step out. If Luo Tian was the human clan’s top, then Sun Miechen was second.

“I’ll go!” Fan Jingyu smiled, his wings unfolding as he stood opposite Sun Miechen.

“Who will fight?” Hun Tiance scanned the human clan before locking onto Luo Tian’s group.

“Arrogant fool!” Diao Dezhu and others sneered at Hun Tiance, mocking him.

“You can fight anyone!” Hun Tiance clearly hated Luo Tian and wanted to kill his friends, making him suffer.

“Who do you think you are?” Long Jie’s aura surged skyward, his imperial dragon qi surrounding him as he rushed toward Hun Tiance.

“Let’s fight—First Prodigy of Seven Star Island!” Tu Feiyang glared at Guan Xingjian, who stood beside Luo Tian, licking his crimson lips.

“Buzz…” Guan Xingjian appeared like a drawn sword, his face cold as he faced Tu Feiyang.

Nan Gong Yuqing, Zhu Ge Jie, Yan Hongtao, and others also found their opponents, rushing toward them. The starry space became lively as everyone retreated to give room for the battle.

Whether human clan or ancient clans, all stepped back, their eyes alight with excitement—they knew this was the true battle of domain-level prodigies.

“Each is a talent beyond comprehension, with the potential to attain enlightenment. Yet they were born in the wrong era!” Several ancient clan powerhouses in the void watched the battle, their eyes filled with admiration.

“Human clan’s strength is truly terrifying!” They then turned cold, gazing at the distance. They knew the human clan had also sent strong figures like them, observing silently.

Luo Tian was surrounded by Diao Dezhu and others, his face pale with illness. His eyes were tense as he watched Long Jie, Nan Gong Yuqing, and Guan Xingjian. If they met any misfortune, he would risk another curse to intervene.

Yet Luo Tian knew their strength was formidable; defeating them required an epoch peak’s intervention. Even among epoch late stage, only powerful ancient clan princes or epoch masters’ offspring had a chance.

“Ming Huan, have you arrived?” Luo Tian gazed into the distance, his eyes filled with murderous intent.

“This might just be the beginning—how many ancient clan princes will appear?” Zhu Ge Qingtian stood beside Luo Tian, his face solemn as he addressed them.

Zhu Ge Qingtian had remained hidden, unaware of his existence to the clan. So he waited like Luo Tian.

“You mean ancient clan princes have also emerged?” Upon hearing Zhu Ge Qingtian’s words, Luo Tian and others frowned.

“I have a faint sense of it,” Zhu Ge Qingtian sighed, as the disciple of Primordial Lord. He and ancient clan princes were of similar rank, sharing an inexplicable connection.

“This is indeed a brilliant era!” Luo Tian and others sighed deeply, never expecting to witness such a clash of prodigies so soon.

Whether human clan or ancient clans, their faces bore admiration as they watched the ongoing battles.

The starry space continuously exploded, each battlefield radiating heart-stirring energy. The thunderous sounds echoed endlessly beneath the stars.

Time passed slowly, and the combatants gradually bore wounds, yet their auras remained skyward, unaffected by injuries.

However, one battlefield caught Luo Tian’s group’s attention—the clash between Zhu Ge Huangchao and Qi Zi’ang.

As time passed, Zhu Ge Huangchao gradually struggled, his body in disarray. He finally realized he was inferior to Qi Zi’ang from the start, always under his control.

“Leave!” Zhu Ge Huangchao felt his weakness and didn’t want to continue fighting. He knew if he persisted, he might truly perish. With a sudden turn, he flew toward the human clan.

“You think you can leave?” The black qilin loomed like a mountain, its black horns radiating lightning. It sealed the arena before rushing toward Zhu Ge Huangchao fleeing toward the human clan.

Though massive, its speed erupted in that moment, becoming a black whirlwind. It appeared behind Zhu Ge Huangchao, its black horns emitting dark light, piercing into his back.

“Puke…” Blood stained the black horn as Zhu Ge Huangchao’s eyes widened in disbelief, his body lifted by Qi Zi’ang.

“Ha!” Qi Zi’ang roared, then swung his head, flinging Zhu Ge Huangchao into the air. He swallowed him in his black maw.

“Damn it!” Zhu Ge Qingtian’s face changed, his body闪身 toward Qi Zi’ang.

“This was all planned by Qi Zi’ang!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, watching Zhu Ge Huangchao devoured. He knew Zhu Ge Huangchao was likely doomed.

“Crunch… crunch…” The black maw continuously chewed, blood flowing from it. The life force in the blood rapidly vanished, leaving people stunned.

“Dead!” People stared at the lifeless blood, their eyes wide with shock. They hadn’t expected the human clan to lose its first epoch late prodigy, a saint’s disciple from the Chaos Domain.

“Alas…” Luo Tian sighed deeply, watching Zhu Ge Huangchao’s death. He recalled their past conflicts; though he had once wanted to kill Zhu Ge Huangchao, various reasons prevented it.

But now seeing him killed by Qi Zi’ang, Luo Tian felt a pang of sorrow.

“Monster!” Zhu Ge Qingtian’s fury erupted, his body radiating fierce energy as he appeared before Qi Zi’ang. He punched forward, striking Qi Zi’ang’s massive body.

A gray fist radiated skyward waves, striking Qi Zi’ang’s colossal form. Zhu Ge Qingtian’s eyes burned with anger.

Zhu Ge Qingtian had closely watched Zhu Ge Huangchao’s battle. Essentially, Zhu Ge Huangchao was his junior. Now that his junior was killed before him, how could he bear it?

“Crack…” The sound of breaking echoed in the starry space. Qi Zi’ang’s massive body was shattered by Zhu Ge Qingtian’s punch, its sound of cracking resounding. Blood splattered across the stars.

“Who is he?” Everyone was stunned, their eyes wide with disbelief as they watched Qi Zi’ang’s massive body fly back.

“He must be a powerhouse from the Chaos Domain. But why hadn’t we seen him before?” People’s eyes lit with excitement, gazing at Zhu Ge Qingtian’s formidable aura.

Qi Zi’ang’s strength was undeniable, but no one had ever made him look so helpless.

“His aura carries an ancient essence and doesn’t belong to this epoch. A powerhouse with such aura can only be one of two: an epoch master’s offspring or disciple!” Someone finally noticed the anomaly in Zhu Ge Qingtian’s aura, exclaiming.

“Zhu Ge Qingtian! The disciple of the Primordial Lord!” A wave of shock swept through people. They hadn’t expected this Grand Assembly to awaken such a high-ranking figure.

“Damn it!” Qi Zi’ang’s heart trembled, shocked by Zhu Ge Qingtian’s power and identity. He hadn’t expected the human clan to awaken an epoch master’s disciple besides Luo Tian.

“Give him back!” Zhu Ge Qingtian waved his hands, gray energy enveloping both of them. The arena was shrouded in lightning within the gray mist as he stepped forward, seemingly slow but instantly appearing before Qi Zi’ang. He swung his fist again at Qi Zi’ang.

“Boom…” Qi Zi’ang’s massive eyes showed pain, his body pushed back by Zhu Ge Qingtian’s punch. His body emitted a thunderous sound, his blood spilling from the mouth.

“Powerful! The disciple of the Primordial Lord is truly terrifying!” The clans were terrified, their faces filled with awe. Even the human clan’s people bore expressions of shock.

“Besides Luo Tian, I’ve never seen a prodigy who could suppress Qi Zi’ang so completely!” Diao Dezhu and others were also awestruck, their eyes turning to Luo Tian.

“In my epoch mid-stage, I wasn’t his match! Now with all my techniques, we might be evenly matched!” Luo Tian shook his head, sighing at Zhu Ge Qingtian’s power. He had once fought against him in his epoch mid-stage and was suppressed. Now, with Luo Tian at epoch late stage, he wasn’t confident of defeating Zhu Ge Qingtian.

Under the blue sky, Zhu Ge Qingtian stood like a sovereign of ages, his face cold as he stepped onto Qi Zi’ang’s massive body. He grabbed Qi Zi’ang’s black horn with both hands.

“Qilin Clan, Black Horn Qilin!” Zhu Ge Qingtian exerted his strength, blood splattering as a black horn emerged from his grasp. He tossed it onto the arena.

“Give him back!” Zhu Ge Qingtian struck again, his body crashing onto the arena with Qi Zi’ang. The solid arena exploded into fragments, scattering outward.

“Boom…” The arena was shattered by Zhu Ge Qingtian’s impact, turning into pieces. At the same time, Qi Zi’ang’s body transformed into a blood mist, floating in the starry space. Black blood stained Zhu Ge Qingtian’s body, making his face more sinister.

“Damn it! You actually consumed him! You’re doomed!” Zhu Ge Qingtian’s eyes scanned the blood mist, sensing no trace of Zhu Ge Huangchao. He formed a hand seal, releasing terrifying waves from his hands.

The stars trembled; the entire space seemed to churn with Zhu Ge Qingtian’s fury. A blue sky descended, and a streak of thunder imbued with powerful heavenly laws struck down.

“Ah…” Qi Zi’ang’s flesh and soul cried out in agony within the blue thunder, rapidly vanishing.

“Stop!” A cold voice echoed, and a green-cloaked elder appeared in people’s sight.

“Only you are allowed to kill our chaos domain’s people, but we can’t let you destroy ours!” The sound of a bell echoed with cold words. Zhu Ge Chaos held the chaos ancient bell, his face icy as he appeared before them.

“Old fool! Though the ancient clans are strong, if they attack our chaos domain, I’ll make them pay a heavy price!” Zhu Ge Qingtian waved his hand, and the ancient bell’s staff soared into the air, appearing before the chaos bell. Together, they emitted waves that made people tremble.

“Two epoch treasures!” The qilin clan’s epoch peak powerhouse’s face darkened, gazing at the two terrifying treasures. His body halted.

One epoch treasure was already enough to make an epoch peak wary, but two? Not only did the qilin clan’s epoch peak feel shocked, but so did the ten or so ancient clan powerhouses in the void.

The chaos bell and its staff were clearly from one source. If combined, they would be a devastating strike. Zhu Ge Qingtian, as the true disciple of the Primordial Lord, could fully harness their power.

Epoch treasures were rare, passed down since ancient times. This was the first time anyone had seen two epoch treasures from one epoch master.

“Go back!” Zhu Ge Qingtian’s face was cold as he addressed the qilin clan’s powerhouse. As a disciple of the epoch master, he wouldn’t regard an epoch peak as anything. The Primordial Lord had annihilated countless before.

The qilin clan elder’s face darkened, then he sneered and vanished into the void. He knew no one behind him would help him unless the clan’s prodigies were half-destroyed.

“Another death?” The clans trembled; this was the second ancient clan prodigy to die.

“Are the ancient clans really no better?” The human clan’s people were more energized, their eyes filled with reverence for Zhu Ge Qingtian. This was the same gaze they had for Luo Tian.

“Regretful, this role should have been yours, but it was taken by another!” Diao Dezhu’s eyes bore a wistful look, sighing softly.

“Get out!” Luo Tian glared at Diao Dezhu, surprised he still thought about such things.

“Buzz…” A golden sword cut through the stars, drawing everyone’s attention. Then their faces turned shocked.

Behind them, Fan Jingyu was split in two by the golden sword’s light, blood splattering across the stars.

The bloodstained sword stood with Sun Miechen in golden robes, his sword raised as he waited for Fan Jingyu to revive, ready to kill him again.

“Boom…” The human clan was ignited by Zhu Ge Qingtian and Sun Miechen’s power, erupting in a powerful cheer. Their eyes burned with excitement as they watched the two men.

The ancient clans, however, seemed to freeze, their eyes turning toward the remaining prodigies still locked in battle. It would take time to determine a winner.

“Our ancient clans also have ancient clan princes, right? They should be on their way! If the ancient clan princes arrive, these human clan figures will surely be annihilated!” The clans murmured, their eyes filled with determination.

“Buzz…” Fan Jingyu’s pale face reformed, but before he could react, the golden sword struck again, rushing toward him. Fan Jingyu’s mind trembled.

“Return!” A strong suction force erupted from the void, pulling Fan Jingyu back before the sword could strike. However, the sword’s speed was fast; five pairs of wings were severed and fell into the stars.

“Ha! There’s more to eat!” Chen Zhanbiao laughed, ignoring others’ gazes. He rushed toward the wings with his mouth full of oil.

“Such a glutton!” Diao Dezhu and others blushed, watching Chen Zhanbiao eat even in such a situation. They felt embarrassed.

“My heavens, this big man is truly bold! What can he not eat?” People stared at Chen Zhanbiao, their eyes wide with awe.

“Tastes really good, big brother—try it!” Chen Zhanbiao approached Luo Tian’s group, skillfully stringing the white wings and waved to Luo Tian.

“Alas…” Luo Tian sighed deeply, waving his hand as seven-colored flames surged toward the wings.

“Puke…” Fan Jingyu spat blood, his eyes burning with fury as he watched his wings roasted on fire.

“Regretful that big black dog is gone; if made into hot pot, it would be delicious!” Chen Zhanbiao whispered, but his loud voice was clear to everyone.

“Ha! Ha!” The human clan laughed heartily, their eyes filled with deep respect for Chen Zhanbiao. Who else would dare treat the ancient clan as food? He was the first.

Seven-colored flames soared into the sky, rushing toward the wings Chen Zhanbiao had strung. But before they reached the white wings, a cold snort echoed from the distant stars, sending an invisible wave toward Chen Zhanbiao.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” The next moment, a series of explosions echoed before Chen Zhanbiao’s chest. The waves struck his robust chest, making him furious and eyes wide.

“Who? Show yourself!” His loud voice echoed through the stars as his body radiated fierce energy, gazing at the distance.

“Who do you think you are to eat our noble feather clan’s wings?” A cold voice echoed through the stars as a figure with an imposing aura stepped out from the void, his eyes coldly gazing at Chen Zhanbiao.

“This person has the same aura as me!” Zhu Ge Qingtian’s face turned solemn, his aura slowly rising as he gazed at the young man who had approached them.

“Feather Clan, Ancient Clan Prince, Yu Fanta!” Soon, the ancient clan people recognized the young man. Their eyes were filled with awe as they gazed at him.

Compared to the human clan’s epoch master, the ancient clans’ hierarchy was strict. Ancient clan princes held high status. Even epoch peak clan members would bow before them.

Luo Tian and the others’ faces changed, surprised by the quick emergence of an ancient clan prince.

The young man’s body radiated golden light, lacking the wings like Fan Jingyu but his aura was exceptionally powerful. This made Luo Tian’s heart wary.

“Did you almost kill one of our feather clan?” Yu Fanta turned, gazing at Sun Miechen who was also radiant with divine light. His eyes held a smile, but his aura exuded an upper-class authority.

“Then you must die!” The next moment, Yu Fanta vanished from sight, becoming a streak of light before Sun Miechen. His golden fist struck toward him.

“Want to kill me? See if you have the ability!” Sun Miechen’s eyes burned with fierce battle spirit. Even facing an ancient clan prince, he showed no fear. His golden sword rose before him.

“Crack…” The golden sword emitted a buzzing sound, bending as Yu Fanta’s fist struck it. Yet the fist still collided with Sun Miechen’s chest.

“Cough… cough…” Sun Miechen’s body was pushed back, his eyes wide with shock as blood flowed from his mouth.

“First kill you, then that glutton!” Yu Fanta’s face was cold as he stepped forward again, his body radiating energy. He rushed toward Sun Miechen, his fists striking one after another like an undefeated god.

“Fear you? No!” Sun Miechen’s eyes showed defiance, his aura rising as he planted his sword into the void. He engaged Yu Fanta in close combat, their battle echoing through the stars.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound of battle filled the void as they clashed again, shaking the stars.

“Ah…” Zhu Ge Jie went mad, his eyes blood-red as he fought with Jin Ziyan. Yet he was constantly suppressed.

Jin Ziyan, once the first prodigy of the ancient clan, was no match for Zhu Ge Jie. Even with his Primordial Body, Jin Ziyan showed no fear.

Zhu Ge Jie saw his brother killed and fell into a mad state. Each strike was filled with terrifying waves, his attacks growing stronger due to desperation.

But the more desperate he became, the more mistakes he made. Jin Ziyan was no ordinary opponent; even when Luo Tian fought him, he had to be careful. Only by revealing his identity did he defeat Jin Ziyan.

“Die!” Jin Ziyan struck Zhu Ge Jie with a fist, spewing golden flames that engulfed the stars. The intense heat spread across the void, setting Zhu Ge Jie’s body ablaze with golden flames.

“Ah…” A piercing scream echoed through the stars as Zhu Ge Jie struggled, his cold sweat flowing. Jin Ziyan’s flames had caused him significant damage.

After defeating Qi Zi’ang, Zhu Ge Qingtian had been observing Zhu Ge Jie. With his brother dead, he couldn’t allow another loss. If Zhu Ge Jie fell, it would be a major blow to the Chaos Domain.

“Return!” Zhu Ge Qingtian roared, rushing toward Zhu Ge Jie. A blue sky descended over his head as he pointed a finger, extinguishing the flames on Zhu Ge Jie. He then spoke to him.

“Ah…” Zhu Ge Jie roared, but seeing Zhu Ge Qingtian’s gaze, he dared not disobey. He flew back to the human clan’s forces, panting heavily.

“Kill!” Zhu Ge Qingtian saw Zhu Ge Jie return and rushed toward Jin Ziyan.
