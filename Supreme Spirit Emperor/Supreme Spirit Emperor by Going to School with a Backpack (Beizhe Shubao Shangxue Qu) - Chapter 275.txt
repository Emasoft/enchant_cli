The seven-colored flame appeared small at first glance, yet even from a distance, Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan could sense the world-shattering power contained within it. The terrifying heat made their blood boil as if ignited by an inferno.

"Seven-colored flame... I've never seen it before," Luo Tian murmured, his voice laced with awe.

"Indeed, no one has. What truly unsettles me is the aura it radiates—Epochal Power. This flame must have attained sentience, rivaling even the might of an Epoch Master. Perhaps it surpasses them!" Jiang Nanxuan's gaze held a rare solemnity as he stared at the seven-colored flame, his brows furrowing slightly.

"Fire Spirit! The soul of this entire fire sea!" Jiang Nanxuan suddenly recalled an ancient legend. When flame cultivation reaches its zenith, it becomes the progenitor of all flames. Even the mightiest celestial fire would bow before this seven-colored flame.

"嗡……" At that moment, a resonant hum echoed within Luo Tian's dantian. A verdant green flame burst forth from his body, surging toward the dancing seven-colored flame with fervent intensity.

"Return!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed as he issued a command, urging the Jade Crystal Luminous Flame back. The seven-colored flame's presence felt too terrifying—more so than the pressure from Dongbo Xin.

"If my suspicions are correct, this seven-colored flame must be a Fire Spirit who once ascended to become an Epoch Master," Luo Tian mused, recalling another legend.

Fire Domain had once produced an Epoch Master. That master, defying fate, wielded a celestial fire and cultivated a true spirit to ascend to the Epoch Master's rank. Legends say that upon achieving perfection, this fire spirit manifested in seven colors.

"But the aura of this fire spirit is formidable... yet it pales before an Epoch Master's terror," Jiang Nanxuan frowned. Having been nurtured by the Celestial Demon Flower, he understood the true magnitude of an Epoch Master's power.

"I feel it too," Luo Tian admitted, recalling a vision of Miaoyin. The aura of that apparition was far stronger than this seven-colored flame.

"Something must have transpired. Even celestial fire wouldn't endure so long without reason," Jiang Nanxuan's expression darkened.

As they spoke, the Jade Crystal Luminous Flame reached the seven-colored flame. It danced before it like a commoner encountering a sovereign, radiating reverence.

"Return!" Luo Tian repeatedly sent mental commands, but the flame ignored him entirely.

"Who am I... why am I here..." A low voice echoed through the dark星空, causing Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan to pale. Without hesitation, they turned back. Who knew what state this seven-colored flame was in? If it had become as deranged as Dongbo Xin, they might not survive.

The fire sea roared. Black flames surged like a mad beast, their violent energy rendering the星空 colorless.

More than that, the endless fire sea erupted in a cataclysmic explosion. The flames surged skyward.

At Fire Domain's periphery, alchemists who had been refining pills in the fire sea found their furnaces shatter violently. The explosive flames hurled them beyond the fire sea, leaving them stunned and bewildered.

"嗡……" A transmission force enveloped Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan, instantly transporting them from the星空.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian's face contorted with alarm. He desperately called for the Jade Crystal Luminous Flame, but it remained unresponsive. This flame was his lifeblood, a companion for years—now utterly unresponsive.

Yet the overwhelming transmission force swiftly propelled them out of the fire sea, depositing them beneath Fire Domain's星空. Their final sight was the seven-colored flame radiating brilliant hues, casting its light over the black星空.

"Luo Tian, are you alright?" Jiang Nanxuan asked anxiously upon emerging from the星空. He knew the deep bond between Luo Tian and the Jade Crystal Luminous Flame—fire's endurance meant Luo Tian's survival, and vice versa.

"I'm fine. But our connection has been severed completely," Luo Tian shook his head, a pang of loss in his heart. The Jade Crystal Luminous Flame had grown alongside him.

"Perhaps this was its fate," Jiang Nanxuan offered. "When it becomes strong enough, we may meet again."

"Boom..." The fire sea surged violently after Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan emerged. A crimson barrier materialized, sealing the fire sea.

"Regardless, we've returned to Fire Domain," Luo Tian gazed at the gathered figures, exhaling heavily.

Chapter 1158: Situation

Within Fire Domain, those expelled by the fire sea gaped in astonishment. Their eyes widened as they beheld the crimson barrier enclosing the fire sea.

"What's going on?" Some murmured. A half-epoch master attempted to breach the barrier but was repelled, spitting blood.

"This... the fire sea is sealed! No one can enter!" Luo Tian marveled, sensing the barrier's immense power.

"Master Luo!" As Luo Tian spoke, people turned their attention to him. His reputation across the Nine Realms was unparalleled.

"Everyone, the Nine Realms are on the brink of chaos. Return to your sects and heed the Three Daoist Sects' commands!" Luo Tian's gaze was resolute. He knew these people had been secluded in the fire sea, unaware of the recent chaos in the Mortal Domain.

"Yes!" No one dared doubt Luo Tian. His authority and power were undeniable, even to epoch masters.

"We should return," Luo Tian's eyes flickered with urgency. They'd lingered too long in the Four Saints Domain. He needed to know the current state of the Nine Realms.

Jiang Nanxuan said nothing, following Luo Tian as they became two streaks of light, vanishing from sight.

Their current cultivation allowed them to reach Tongtian Mountain in two days. Yet as they journeyed, they noticed changes in Fire Domain—vast lands devoid of life, sending a wave of tension through them.

"Did the fire sea suffer an incident? Did the Mortal Domain attack it?" Luo Tian pondered, but Fire Domain hadn't turned as bloodthirsty as the Four Saints Domain. This eased their worries slightly.

Time passed swiftly. In a day and a half, Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan neared Tongtian Mountain. Yet their pace slowed as they spotted numerous lands before them, each teeming with people.

"What is this?"

Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan halted on a land, approaching a cultivator to inquire. They learned Fire Domain's situation.

Since news of the Mortal Domain's chaos spread, Fire Domain had been in turmoil. Everyone knew the Mortal Domain's unrest threatened all Nine Realms. To ensure safety, people flocked to the Three Daoist Sects, obeying their orders.

The Three Daoist Sects had recently commanded Fire Domain's strength to relocate lands within Tongtian Mountain's vicinity. Unity was their only hope against the Mortal Domain's chaos.

Now, most sects and common lands in Fire Domain were gathered around Tongtian Gate. Each land radiated tension, prepared for the impending chaos.

Not just Fire Domain—news of the Mortal Domain's chaos spread across all Nine Realms. Each domain mobilized, drawing toward sacred lands and clans. Sacred clans possessed epochal treasures and formidable power, surviving past Mortal Domain chaos unscathed. Their神子神女 were trained like warriors, facing no real threat.

Luo Tian's brows furrowed as the cultivator spoke. Though sacred clans were powerful, he sensed this Mortal Domain chaos was different. If they clung to past strategies, they might suffer a major loss.

Past Mortal Domain chaos had left some survivors as seeds for future harvests. But this time, the Four Saints Domain's fate suggested a complete extermination—had Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan not returned promptly, the Four Saints Domain would have been wiped out entirely.

"We must return immediately to warn the Demon Race and Beast Domain!" Luo Tian's urgency grew. He and Jiang Nanxuan vanished before the bewildered cultivator.

Two streaks of light pierced the星空. In half a day, they arrived at Tongtian Mountain's outskirts. The mountain was overcrowded. Beside it stood a purple land—Shanhai Pavilion's Shanhai Domain.

Another vast land belonged to Lihuo Sect's Lihuo Domain. Three lands formed a triangular formation, surrounded by countless sects' lands.

Fire Domain's people and the Four Saints Domain's had been stationed at Tongtian Gate, deliberating on how to face the crisis.

"Luo Tian hasn't returned yet! It's been nearly two months, and no news!" In the hall, people wore worried expressions, murmuring.

Two months was but a blink for cultivators. Yet each second without Luo Tian's return felt agonizing. His role as the unifying force between two domains was irreplaceable.

"Luo Tian's fortune is great. With Jiang Nanxuan's composure and the Ancient Heaven Palace, he should be safe," Luo Xiong spoke solemnly, trying to comfort them. Yet all knew he was more anxious than anyone.

"If Luo Tian perishes in the Four Saints Domain, we'll retaliate. We'll fight to the death!" Someone rallied, and the hall erupted in chaos. The Four Saints Domain's people had been restless.

Luo Hongtao and Lu Han Tian's authority couldn't contain the Four Saints Domain's people. After several attempts to calm them, they managed to suppress the unrest.

"Everyone, we must think long-term," Luo Hongtao sighed, his voice laced with helplessness.

"Think long-term! We've been thinking for over a month!" Gu Lei scoffed, his impatience evident. The Gu family had risen to prominence; with Gu Tianshi as their patriarch, their strength was unparalleled. His words carried weight.

"Indeed!" Many Gu family disciples echoed, their loyalty to Luo Tian deep-rooted. Without him, the Gu family wouldn't have thrived.

Gu Yun and Tian Bo stood behind Gu Lei. The Gu family was now under Gu Lei's management; unless it was a major issue, they wouldn't interfere.

"Right! Let's fight back! Without epochal treasures, how can we resist the Mortal Domain? We'll die anyway. Better to strike first!" After the Gu family, Tian Dao Sect's Lei Yongjichen and others rallied.

The Tianyuan Domain's people erupted in chaos. They'd waited too long, and their deep affection for Luo Tian made them desperate.

"Let's gather our forces! The Tianyuan Domain has no cowards!" Gu Lei and others led the charge, exiting the hall. The elder generation—Luo Xiong, Long Jian—remained silent, their silence implying agreement.

"Quite lively," as Gu Lei and others reached the hall's entrance, Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan appeared at the door, confronting Gu Lei and Lei Yongjichen.

"Luo Tian!" People's faces shifted from gloom to joy, rushing out to surround him. His calm presence reassured them.

"You always do this! If you're going to die, at least let us know!" Elderly figures scolded him without restraint.

"Forgive me for worrying you all," Luo Tian felt touched, bowing respectfully to the elders.

"Never do this again. If you pull another stunt like this, Fire Domain and Four Saints Domain will have no hope," Luo Xiong shook his head, recalling the chaos these people had endured. Luo Tian's return gave them a leader.

"Gu Lei, apologize to Master Du and Master Lu," Luo Tian's expression hardened as he addressed Gu Lei.

Their previous outbursts had wounded Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian. Now, with the Four Saints Domain residing in Fire Domain, Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian had aided them greatly. Being scolded by Gu Lei's group, though unspoken, would leave a grudge.

Luo Tian didn't want the two domains to grow apart. The only way was to set an example, and Gu Lei was the ideal target. Others like Lei Yongjichen were his seniors; he couldn't confront them directly.

"This..." Gu Lei's face darkened. Seeing Luo Tian's stern gaze, he felt his anger flare. He stepped toward Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian.

"Apologies for my earlier disrespect. Please don't take it personally," Gu Lei bowed respectfully to Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian.

Chapter 1159: The Arrival of the Divine Clan

At Tongtian Mountain's Tongtian Gate, all top figures from Fire Domain and Four Saints Domain stood outside the hall. They watched Gu Lei bow respectfully to Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian, their faces filled with admiration for Luo Tian.

They were familiar with Gu Lei's character. Though he often acted carefree, they knew his stubbornness. Even Gu Yun struggled to manage him at times.

Yet now, this stubborn Gu Lei obeyed Luo Tian's command in front of everyone, showing such respect.

"Nothing to worry about. You were just concerned for Luo Tian," Du Hongtao and Lu Han Tian smiled, helping Gu Lei up. They felt gratitude toward Luo Tian for salvaging their dignity.

Others like Zheng Xin and Xu Liyi stood red-faced, grateful Luo Tian hadn't forced them to apologize.

"Authority—this is Luo Tian's authority!" People mused. Between the two domains, no one could be replaced—only Luo Tian could bind them together.

"A sacred herb," Luo Tian smiled, sending a mental message to Gu Lei. Gu Lei's brow twitched; he knew there was no way to regain face now. Accepting a sacred herb was the best option.

"Still, someone can discipline you," Xu Liyi approached Gu Lei, clapping his shoulder with a smug grin.

"Go to hell, bachelor! Trust me, I'll give you some medicine to keep your five-year-old girl busy tonight!" Gu Lei retorted.

Since Zheng Xin had mocked Xu Liyi for his bachelor status, Gu Lei joined her. Every time he was embarrassed, he'd use this to mock Xu Liyi's arrogance.

"Hmph!" Xu Liyi had no chance to respond, retreating to Chen Zhanbiao's side.

"Ha ha..." Someone lightened the mood, causing laughter to erupt. The atmosphere grew slightly relaxed.

Luo Tian's brow furrowed as he watched Xu Liyi still laughing with the group. Yet in that brief moment, he caught a flicker of loneliness in Xu Liyi's eyes—quickly gone but unmistakable.

Xu Liyi had once accompanied Luo Tian to the Ice Island, where he'd become infatuated with Luo Qingqing—Luo Zhan's granddaughter and Luo Tian's sister.

"Such a long time, yet this fool still hasn't succeeded. I should find an opportunity to help him," Luo Tian sighed, entering the hall amidst the crowd.

Everyone took their seats. Luo Tian still sat at the lower position, as his rank wasn't the highest among them.

"Luo Tian, tell us about the Four Saints Domain's situation," Luo Xiong and others asked immediately after sitting. All eyes turned to Luo Tian, their expressions tense.

"The Four Saints Domain was destroyed!" Luo Tian spoke softly. The hall fell silent. The Four Saints Domain's people stared at him in disbelief.

"Everyone, both commoners and cultivators, perished. Jiang Nanxuan and I saved about a hundred million commoners. Now, the Four Saints Domain has only a hundred million commoners and one million cultivators left," Jiang Nanxuan added, his face etched with sorrow.

"Boom..." The hall's atmosphere exploded. Everyone's eyes turned blood-red, their murderous intent piercing the sky. The hall was overturned as people gasped for breath.

"冥域's arrival was too sudden. If you hadn't come to rescue me, the Four Saints Domain would have suffered more," Luo Tian sighed, his voice echoing. Strange fluctuations in his words calmed the enraged crowd.

"Fight back! Take revenge for the Four Saints Domain's people!" Everyone roared, looking to Luo Tian. They'd follow his command without hesitation.

"Everyone, listen. The Mortal Domain is far stronger than we imagined. Their vanguard alone has a million troops, with several masters at the peak of their power. If we clash directly, we'll perish. The Four Saints Domain must survive—so long as we live, it exists!" Luo Tian urged.

"As long as we live, there's hope," Jiang Nanxuan murmured, his sigh deep.

"Our priority is to preserve our heritage. This Mortal Domain chaos is unprecedented—clearly, they aim for the entire Nine Realms to perish! We mustn't be careless," Luo Tian reiterated, calming the crowd.

Silence followed his words. Everyone's eyes reflected contemplation.

"Report! Someone has arrived in Fire Domain, seeking the Three Daoist Sects' masters!" A disciple appeared, his face respectful.

"Who is it?" Du Hongtao frowned, stepping forward to meet the Shanhai Pavilion disciple.

"The person claims to be from the Divine Clan," the disciple replied respectfully.

"Divine Clan?" Upon hearing this, people fell silent. Their gazes turned hostile toward Tongtian Mountain's outskirts.

"Unexpectedly, the Divine Clan dares to come here. They're seeking death!" Zheng Xin shouted, his voice cold.

The Four Saints Domain had a deep grudge with the Divine Clan. The latter likely sought to eliminate Luo Tian and his group. If not for fear of Gu Tianshi's power, they'd have acted already.

But with time passing, news of Gu Tianshi's departure would spread. People assumed the Divine Clan was about to make a move, rising to meet them at Tongtian Mountain's outskirts.

"Everyone, don't be alarmed. It's an old friend," Luo Tian smiled, gazing into the void to see two young figures outside Tongtian Mountain.

"Let's go. They're old friends. Let's greet them," Luo Tian smiled, following the crowd out of Tongtian Mountain.

"Feiyu Li, wait. Control your temper. These people are no pushovers. If a conflict arises, I can't protect you," A tall youth in golden robes repeatedly warned his younger companion.

"Understood. I just want to see what the one who defeated the Divine Clan looks like," the youth's eyes gleamed with battle fervor.

"Trouble," Sun Feiwen saw the youth's expression and his careless reply, knowing he'd made a mistake.

"Buzz..." As Sun Feiwen sighed, Luo Tian followed Luo Xiong and Du Hongtao, arriving in the星空.

Murderous intent surged. Everyone glared at Sun Feiwen and his companion as if they wanted to devour them.

"Luo Tian!" Sun Feiwen smiled, bowing to Luo Tian. Seeing his calm aura, even Sun Feiwen felt a flicker of fear.

Sun Feiwen knew Luo Tian had grown stronger. Though he didn't need to look up to him, he understood that his current self couldn't last three moves against Luo Tian.

"Luo Xiong! What brings you to our Four Saints Domain?" Luo Tian stepped forward, signaling everyone to calm down as he greeted Sun Feiwen.

Their relationship had always been good. Even during Luo Tian's outburst against the Divine Clan, Sun Feiwen hadn't attacked him.

"I've come to deliver my clan's Emperor's decree," Sun Feiwen looked at Luo Tian, his expression solemn.

"Oh?" Luo Tian raised an eyebrow. He wanted to see what the Divine Clan Emperor Sun Shengtian had in store.

"Speak. If it's suicide, I can't do it," Luo Tian chuckled, joking with Sun Feiwen.

"Divine Clan Emperor's decree is sacred. One must kneel in reverence," Before Sun Feiwen could speak, his companion spoke with the Divine Clan's typical arrogance.

The youth commanded with an air of superiority. Though he seemed carefree, his aura radiated late-stage Sage power. His eyes burned with battle intent.

"Who the hell are you?"

"Don't be foolish, or you'll die," As the youth's words fell, Zheng Xin and others sneered at him, mocking his ignorance.

Chapter 1160: The Divine Clan's Imperial Decree

Outside Tongtian Mountain's星空, the Four Saints Domain and Fire Domain gathered around Sun Feiwen and his companion, their faces filled with mockery.

"The Divine Clan's Emperor sounds impressive. But it means nothing here in the Four Saints Domain and Fire Domain. You'll kneel today, brothers! Let's fight!" Zheng Xin didn't hesitate, shouting at his group.

"Fight him! He came here to show off. I thought Diaodezhu was the worst at showing off, but now I've seen someone worse!" Gu Lei roared, his purple spiritual energy swirling. A vacuum formed around him, forcing everyone to retreat a hundred feet.

"Everyone, don't misunderstand. This is my younger brother, Sun Feili! He's been in seclusion for years. When Luo Tian caused chaos in the Divine Clan, he wasn't present. He's apologized for any offense. Please forgive him," Sun Feiwen quickly explained, looking to Luo Tian. He knew Luo Tian's opinion carried the most weight.

Luo Tian saw Sun Feiwen's pleading gaze and nodded. He turned to Sun Feili, asking softly, "What if I refuse to kneel?"

"Are you brave enough to fight? I'll make you kneel!" Sun Feili boasted.

"Feili, come back!" Sun Feiwen's face turned red. He scolded his arrogant brother for causing trouble, regretting bringing this troublemaker. Every time he caused issues, Sun Feiwen had to clean up the mess.

"Ah... youth," Zheng Xin and others sighed, watching Sun Feili's battle fervor.

"Fine. If you want to fight, then fight," Luo Tian smiled, observing Sun Feili's late-stage Sage aura.

Though Sun Feili seemed impulsive, his strength was undeniable. He matched Sun Feiwen's power and even surpassed him slightly. Sun Feiwen had been the Divine Clan's prince, but his many duties hindered his cultivation.

"听说 even Sun Miechen was defeated by you. If I defeat you, would that make me the Divine Clan's top talent?" Sun Feili's eyes burned with fervor. Though not a divine body, his flesh radiated divine light.

"You're right. Defeating me would make you stronger than Sun Miechen," Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with interest.

Luo Tian was now a Sage Peak master. A Sun Feili was no threat. If Sun Miechen had reached Sage Peak, he'd be cautious. But Sun Feili's talent was no match for him.

"Good! Then you accept?" Sun Feili's battle spirit reached its peak. He took a step forward, divine patterns rising beneath his feet, surging toward Luo Tian.

"Wow... this kid has some skill," Zheng Xin and others frowned, watching Sun Feili's radiant form. They were surprised by his strength, feeling a heavy pressure.

Divine patterns surged like waves, striking Luo Tian. Yet they didn't move him an inch. His white robes remained untouched. He smiled at Sun Feili.

"Let him suffer a little. Luo Xiong, please let me spare his life," Sun Feiwen sighed, pleading to Luo Tian. He was disappointed in Sun Feili's recklessness.

"Fine, I'll grant you this favor," Luo Tian smiled, addressing Sun Feiwen.

"No need for your favor!" Sun Feili heard Luo Tian's words, sensing his indifference. He grew angry and dashed toward Luo Tian.

"Boom..." Golden light erupted. Sun Feili, true to his name, didn't use any martial arts. His golden fist struck with a thunderous impact, piercing space and appearing beside Luo Tian. Divine patterns covered his fist, as if it were an unstoppable strike.

"Luo Tian, be careful!" Zheng Xin and others warned him. They felt Sun Feili's fist radiated terrifying fluctuations. Even they would suffer great damage, possibly being shattered by his punch.

"His power is decent," Luo Tian shook his head, lazily throwing a fist. It moved slowly but collided with Sun Feili's fist.

"Crack..." A crackling sound echoed. Sun Feili, who had looked like a warrior god, was sent flying back with a blood spurt. His entire arm turned to mist, his golden flesh riddled with cracks. He looked at Luo Tian in disbelief.

Sun Feiwen moved swiftly, catching Sun Feili mid-air. But the immense force also sent him flying into space.

They flew over a thousand feet before stopping, their eyes filled with fear.

"Again!" Sun Feili's Divine Clan Regeneration Art activated. His injuries vanished instantly, his eyes filled with resentment as he rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Enough," Luo Tian sighed. He pointed his fingers, divine light spreading. Dao patterns surged, forming a Dao prison that instantly enveloped Sun Feili.

"Boom..." Sun Feiwen was still moving forward. He hadn't expected to be trapped in the prison. Colliding with it, he and Sun Feili both spat blood, their flesh beginning to disintegrate.

"Enough?" Luo Tian smiled, his aura surging. The overwhelming power of a Sage Peak master spread across the星空, forming an invisible dragon that coiled around Sun Feili.

"Sage Peak!" People's faces showed shock. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to have reached Sage Peak.

Though Luo Tian had always seemed unfathomable, no one had guessed he'd achieved Sage Peak. His youth made it even more astonishing.

"How many years has it been? Our Four Saints Domain finally has a Sage Peak master!" Elderly masters laughed, their voices filled with excitement.

Sun Feiwen's face changed. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to reach Sage Peak so quickly. At such a young age, he was undoubtedly the first in their generation to achieve this.

"Sun Miechen is still in seclusion, aiming for Sage Peak. Yet Luo Tian has beaten him," Sun Feiwen muttered, his voice laced with bitterness. To live in this epoch was a sorrow.

"Is that enough?" Luo Tian asked Sun Feili, who was now speechless in the prison. His earlier actions had been foolish—challenging a Sage Peak master with his late-stage Sage power. He was indeed short-sighted.

"I yield... I yield!" Sun Feili looked at Luo Tian with respect, no longer struggling. He knew he couldn't match a Sage Peak master.

Luo Tian didn't press the issue. He'd promised Sun Feiwen, so he honored his word. He pointed a finger, the Dao prison shattered, freeing Sun Feili.

"Feiwen, what's your business?" Luo Tian asked as if nothing had happened, his aura returning to calm. He looked at Sun Feiwen.

"Indeed," Sun Feiwen snapped out of his shock. He waved his hand, and a ancient mirror flew from it, radiating golden light.

The mirror hummed. Patterns flowed, golden light illuminated the星空. A figure in imperial robes—Sun Shengtian's apparition—appeared.

Though it was just an illusion, Sun Shengtian radiated a profound aura. His gaze was deep and resolute.
