“Regardless, let us first overcome this immediate crisis. Who can predict the future? If I attain the Dao, all ancient tribes will kneel before me!” Luo Tian had now set his sights on becoming an Epoch Master.

After bidding farewell to Meng Lingxiao’s four spirit essences, Luo Tian’s figure appeared in the courtyard where Diao Yuanshan had once lived. Upon arrival, he was immediately surrounded by a group of people.

As time passed, Jiang Nanxuan, Xu Liyi, Zheng Xin, and others emerged from their cultivation retreats. Except for Long Jie, Yan Jun, and Jiang Nanxuan, the others had fully recovered. However, Long Jie and the others had lost their primordial essence, making recovery a matter of days.

“Luo Tian, the Thunder Domain has sent another distress signal to the other domains. The entire Thunder Domain is nearly annihilated, and those who rushed to support it are trapped in the domain’s last refuge. We must move quickly to assist!” Zheng Xin immediately spoke upon regaining composure, detailing the crisis in the Thunder Domain.

“So quickly!” Luo Tian had not expected the Thunder Domain and its reinforcements to be so swiftly overwhelmed.

“There was no choice. Ming Yongzhi is a powerhouse from the early Epoch, and with the Epoch Treasure, Runic Cauldron of Blood, no one could withstand him. If it weren’t for the Demon Lord and Starry Domain’s Master bringing two Epoch Treasures to support, the Thunder Domain would already be destroyed!” The others spoke, their gazes filled with concern.

“Support! You and your people go assist. I, Long Jie, and Yan Jun will head to the Beast Domain’s Holy City to ensure Diao Dezu’s safety!” Luo Tian made his decision swiftly, splitting forces: one group to aid the Thunder Domain, while he and Long Jie, Yan Jun journeyed toward the Beast Domain.

“Good!” Luo Xiong and other elder masters nodded, quickly organizing their forces. Nearly a million warriors from two domains departed via transmission arrays to reinforce the Thunder Domain.

Meanwhile, Fire Domain left around five hundred thousand warriors behind as its base could not be compromised.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian watched people depart hurriedly, then extended two leaves of Immortal Herbs into Long Jie, Yan Jun, and Jiang Nanxuan’s bodies. These leaves had been gifted to Luo Tian by Meng Lingyun before he left the Ancient Heaven Palace.

“Immortal Herb!” Jiang Nanxuan felt a familiar essence and smiled, immediately refining it into his body without hesitation.

Long Jie and Yan Jun also began refining the leaves, restoring their lost essence. Returning to the Beast Domain meant unknown dangers; losing their blood weakened their strength, preventing them from reaching peak potential.

After half an hour, the three fully refined the two leaves, regaining their completeness. Long Jie even showed a hint of breaking through to the next stage.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian was satisfied, leaving Jiang Nanxuan behind to guard Tongtian Mountain while he and Long Jie, Yan Jun appeared at the vast transmission array outside the domain.

Chapter 1185: The Wretched Diao Dezu

In the Beast Domain, due to the alliance of eight domains against the Demon Domain, a massive transmission network had been established. Thus, Luo Tian and his companions arrived at the Beast Domain in an instant.

As the third major domain among nine, the Beast Domain had not yet been touched by the Demon Domain’s war. Though the starfield remained tense, all forces gathered outside the Holy City. Beasts still roamed freely but avoided venturing too far from the city, fearing unexpected incidents.

Luo Tian and his companions walked beneath the Beast Domain’s starfield. The transmission array was not far from the Holy City, and with their speed, they reached it in just over an hour.

The Holy City remained vast, with the eight major clans’ territories clearly defined. Upon their arrival, they were immediately spotted by the locals.

“Luo Tian!” Most capable clans had gathered in the Holy City. Seeing Luo Tian, they exclaimed in surprise.

After their exclamation, they all glared at Luo Tian. Recently, he had slain Feng Jiutian, the leader of the eight major clans in the Holy City. This news had spread throughout the Beast Domain, and Feng Jiutian’s death was not just a disgrace to the Phoenix Clan but to the entire Beast Domain.

“Report to the Holy Ancestor. Say Luo Tian has arrived!” A series of beast-shaped figures, though glaring at Luo Tian, dared not approach him. After all, Luo Tian’s strength was formidable across the nine domains; even Feng Jiutian had perished at his hands. Yet, if the Holy Ancestors gave orders, they would surely attack Luo Tian.

Figures vanished into the crowd. One could guess their purpose: informing others.

Luo Tian ignored these informants, knowing this visit to the Beast Domain would be more difficult than before. These Holy Ancestors would not let him leave easily; they were now his enemies.

As the three walked toward Diao Dezu’s territory, Feng Zu immediately received news of Luo Tian and his companions’ arrival. Sitting in the hall, Feng Zu’s eyes flashed with endless killing intent.

“Three of them dare to come to the Beast Domain? They truly regard it as an ordinary domain!” Feng Zu sneered, his gaze deep.

“Diao Yuanshan has used forbidden arts; he will surely not survive. Gu Tianshu fled, I wonder who will support him!” Feng Zu muttered, taking out his identity token to transmit to other elders.

No need for Feng Zu’s call; the other elders also received Luo Tian’s news. However, unlike Feng Zu, their expressions varied.

They were genuinely terrified of Luo Tian. Previously in the Fire Domain, they had nearly lost their lives; escaping was a miracle.

When the Demon Domain’s army attacked, these elders had escaped under the protection of the Beast Mirror. After recovering from their injuries, they heard about the Demon Domain’s attack on the Fire Domain—1.5 million warriors annihilated. Though it was Eastbo Xin’s doing, they still marveled at Luo Tian’s powerful backing.

“Let’s go see this kid. What底气 does he have to come into our Holy City?” Feng Zu’s voice echoed in the elders’ minds, causing them a bitter expression.

Though reluctant, they could not refuse Feng Zu’s command. Yet, thinking of their clan’s formidable resources, they regained confidence.

“Where is Diao Dezu now?” Feng Zu asked the elders after transmitting, his gaze turning to the current Phoenix Clan leader.

“The barriers Diao Yuanshan set are formidable. The clan leaders have been attacking relentlessly, but breaking through is just a matter of time!” The Phoenix Clan leader spoke, his gaze respectful. Since Feng Jiutian’s death, he had lived in fear, as he had done nothing while Luo Tian left unchallenged.

“Good. That kid must have come to find Diao Dezu! Let’s go to the Diao Clan!” Feng Zu’s gaze bore authority, leading his clan toward Diao Dezu’s territory.

……
In the Diao Clan’s domain, vast and desolate, only Diao Yuanshan and his grandson Diao Dezu remained. Later, the Star Dragon Ant Clan moved in but did not change the emptiness; they numbered only two hundred.

Previously, Yan Jun had taken some Star Dragon Ant Clan members to rescue Luo Tian. Now, the Star Dragon Ant Clan was left with only the weak and infirm, standing alongside Diao Dezu in the territory of the Ghost Fang Clan.

In the Beast Domain, Diao Dezu had once been arrogant, even disregarding Feng Jiutian. He was the only one in the Beast Domain who could challenge Feng Jiutian, though slightly weaker. Yet no one dared to touch Diao Dezu because of Diao Yuanshan’s presence.

However, the Ghost Fang Clan’s territory was different from usual. The vast domain was wrapped in a purple barrier, with continuous explosions echoing above it. Various martial arts techniques radiated powerful fluctuations, constantly striking the purple barrier, shaking buildings and causing massive collapses.

Diao Dezu stood grimly in the domain, gazing at the clan leaders across. His gaze was deep, but without the barrier’s support, he would already be under attack.

“Diao Dezu! You boasted of being invincible at your level. Come out and fight us!” The Peng Clan leader spoke, gazing at Diao Dezu within the barrier, shouting with disdain.

“Yes! Come out. Your dead grandfather has already left before you. The Ghost Fang Clan now has only one person left; no one supports you. Are you scared?” The Elephant Clan leader shouted, his voice booming with pride.

“You damn fool!” Diao Dezu’s face turned red. He refused to accept the truth, cursing from within the barrier, wanting to step out and shut their mouths. But outside were not only clan leaders but also elders; he had no chance of survival.

“Haha, don’t delude yourself. Your dead grandfather used forbidden arts; there’s no chance of survival!” The clan leaders spoke again, trying to provoke Diao Dezu out.

Diao Dezu’s heart sank. He knew they might be right. Diao Dezu was not foolish; if Diao Yuanshan were alive, they would never dare to come here. And now, they wanted his life.

Thinking of this, Diao Dezu’s eyes moistened. That was his grandfather. He remembered all the things Diao Yuanshan had done for him. His black eyes flashed with cold determination, and he roared into the sky, unable to control himself. His figure vanished from the barrier, appearing beside the Peng Clan leader, his hand striking the latter’s face.

“You damn fool!” Diao Dezu seemed mad, his speed breaking all limits. Even the Peng Clan leader had no time to react, and Diao Dezu’s slap sent him flying.

“Diao Clan Leader!” The Star Dragon Ant Clan members inside the barrier looked anxious, wanting to call Diao Dezu back. After all, their enemies were numerous and overwhelming.

But Diao Dezu was blinded by hatred, caring nothing else. His sole thought was avenging Diao Yuanshan. His figure moved like a purple ghost, darting among the crowd, his hands striking several clan leaders.

Though Diao Dezu was somewhat spoiled, his talent was undeniable. No one in the Beast Domain could match him except Feng Jiutian and Long Jie.

“Finally, he’s out!” The clan elders smiled, watching Diao Dezu darting between the leaders. They waved their hands, and runes flashed in the air, enveloping the space.

A humming sound echoed as the runes flew into the sky, forming a barrier that enclosed everyone.

At the moment the rune barrier rose, heavy pressure pressed upon them. Diao Dezu’s figure paused, appearing in their sight.

“Knew it! You’re fast. Did you think we had no preparations?” The clan leaders smiled.

This barrier was specifically prepared for Diao Dezu. It had no other purpose but to increase tenfold the gravity within, preventing him from escaping due to his speed.

“Damn!” Diao Dezu paused, his gaze still filled with killing intent. Without his speed advantage, he was only slightly stronger than ordinary clan leaders. He could handle two at most but struggled against many.

“Seems you’ve had preparations for us, the Ghost Fang Clan!” Diao Dezu spoke solemnly. He hadn’t known about this barrier before, so the clans must have hidden it for Diao Yuanshan.

“Since ancient times, the eight Beast Clan tribes have had a rule against mutual slaughter. Are you really going to kill me?” Diao Dezu glared at them.

“Even if we killed Diao Yuanshan, what makes you think we wouldn’t kill you?” As Diao Dezu’s words finished, Feng Zu and other elders walked out from the distance, their powerful presence causing surrounding clan members to show respect.

Chapter 1186: The Dragon Clan’s Rebellion

In the Beast Domain’s Holy City, Diao Dezu stood grim. His mind cleared slightly, his gaze filled with hatred as he looked at the elders who had entered the barrier.

“You really attacked my grandfather?” Diao Dezu gritted his teeth, gazing at Feng Zu, his voice trembling.

“It wasn’t us. Diao Yuanshan was an early Epoch master; we couldn’t match him. It was our clan’s resources that killed him. Diao Yuanshan protected Luo Tian and used forbidden arts to die, we had no choice!” Feng Zu smiled annoyingly, gazing at Diao Dezu surrounded.

“Kill him!” As a clan leader, Diao Dezu knew the Beast Domain’s resources. The Ghost Fang Clan had its own resources, but Diao Dezu didn’t know how to summon them. If he did, he wouldn’t be so helpless now.

“Pity, the last Ghost Fang Clan will perish today!” Feng Zu shook his head gently, raising his hand to suppress Diao Yuanshan.

Other clan leaders also attacked, various martial arts techniques striking Diao Dezu’s head with thunderous explosions.

“Don’t worry, after you die, I’ll summon your clan’s resources to fight against the Demon Domain’s Nine Holy Bloods. This will end your lineage forever. From now on, the Beast Domain will choose a new clan!” Feng Zu spoke, causing some Phoenix Clan members to show excitement.

The eight major Beast Clans had never changed since the domain’s creation. Even if the Ghost Fang Clan was reduced to two people, it remained one of the eight clans, enjoying vast resources.

Now, the Phoenix Clan, which was at its peak in the Beast Domain, wanted to establish another clan. This would surely be chosen from their clans, becoming one of the eight major clans—every beast clan’s dream.

“Too much!” Some elders looked at Feng Zu, feeling a bit of resentment. No clan had ever exterminated another before. Not only did they destroy their lineage, but they also wanted them to fight the Demon Domain—this was too much.

“Purple Qi Eastward, Grand and Vast Three Thousand!” Diao Yuanshan was not passive. Though the martial arts above him were devastating, he refused to sit and die, seeking a chance for survival.

“Fight!” The Star Dragon Ant Clan members inside the barrier saw Diao Dezu in danger and stepped out. Though they were few, they knew the pain of extinction. Even if they were weak, they did not want their benefactor, the Ghost Fang Clan, to be destroyed.

“Riffraff. They’ll all be dealt with eventually,” Feng Zu spoke, his gaze filled with disdain, then attacked again. A sea of fire engulfed the sky, crushing Diao Dezu and the Star Dragon Ant Clan members.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” The explosions echoed. Diao Dezu coughed blood, barely resisting the clan leaders’ attacks and Feng Zu’s previous strike. In an instant, the endless fire surged toward him.

Diao Dezu turned pale. He knew this was a death trap with no chance of survival. Even Luo Tian in his later stage would have no escape.

“Luo Tian, Long Zu, I hope you avenge me!” Diao Dezu roared, his aura soaring. His feet flashed with purple qi, and his black eyes glowed with cold determination as he unleashed all his spiritual power toward Feng Zu.

“Go!” A flurry of golden light flashed, and the Star Dragon Ant Clan members, like meteors, continuously punched to block Feng Zu’s terrifying fire.

“Kill him!” Seeing Diao Dezu rushing toward him, Feng Zu didn’t fight directly but ordered his people.

“Die!” The clan leaders had long hated Diao Dezu. No need for Feng Zu’s command, they凝聚 their powerful martial arts to strike Diao Dezu as he rushed.

“Even if I die, I’ll take two with me! Diao’s Path of the World!” Diao Dezu spoke with madness, his purple qi slowly leaving his body.

“Return!” But just as Diao Dezu was about to fight, a solemn voice echoed. A powerful presence instantly appeared in their perception.

Diao Dezu’s face changed, a hint of joy in his eyes. This voice was too familiar.

“Luo Tian!” Diao Dezu couldn’t help but speak, quickly stopping his forbidden arts. He had almost used them.

“Crack… Crack…” Thunder flashed, three figures—two golden and one black—descended like gods of heaven, roaring down from the sky. Their feet directly stepped on the gravity barrier.

The Dao power spread from Luo Tian’s feet, and within a breath, the rune barrier shattered. The terrifying pressure on Diao Dezu vanished instantly.

“Ghost Fang Step!” Without pressure, Diao Dezu immediately disappeared from his spot, appearing before Luo Tian and the others.

“Come quickly!” Feng Zu’s face darkened as he looked at Luo Tian, who was blood-crazed. If not for his timely arrival, Diao Dezu would have been in danger.

“Yan Jun!” Seeing Yan Jun and the Star Dragon Ant Clan members who had blocked the fierce fire, the Star Dragon Ant Clan members smiled.

“Make way!” Yan Jun’s gaze was deep. Seeing the Star Dragon Ant Clan in such a desperate state, especially seeing the wisps of white smoke rising from the ground, his face turned furious. His black fist struck the overwhelming fire.

“Boom…” The fire surged but was dispelled by Yan Jun’s full power, turning into hot air that dissipated.

In just a moment, the Star Dragon Ant Clan lost ten members. Yan Jun’s face darkened. The Star Dragon Ant Clan was few, and losing ten seemed small but was a significant loss for them. With only two hundred members, each Star Dragon Ant had close ties with Yan Jun.

“Unexpectedly, you truly dared to come. Then stay here!” Feng Zu’s eyes flashed with coldness as he waved his hand, and the Beast Mirror hummed. It instantly enveloped everyone.

At the same time, Luo Tian summoned his Yin Fish spirit essence to counter the Beast Mirror’s Epoch power.

Luo Tian’s eyes showed confidence. His spear, Rupture Heaven, hummed and he dashed toward Feng Zu.

“Damn! Luo Tian, you don’t fear me summoning the Beast Domain’s resources to crush you?” Feng Zu’s face changed. He knew Luo Tian’s combat power was unmatched. Unless they used numbers, the elders couldn’t match Luo Tian.

It seemed like a replay of earlier events. The elders had no will to fight Luo Tian, planning to use their strongest resources—Beast Domain’s resources—to crush Luo Tian.

“Resources?” Luo Tian frowned slightly. His spear pierced Feng Zu, but it didn’t threaten Diao Dezu’s elder.

Then Luo Tian appeared before Diao Dezu and the others. He knew they had to leave; if the elders summoned Beast Domain’s resources, they couldn’t escape.

Thinking this, Luo Tian spoke to Diao Dezu and the others, preparing to evacuate the Beast Domain. They would settle accounts later.

“Want to leave?” Feng Zu’s face was grim. He had also forced himself under pressure, trying to summon resources. He knew the Beast Domain’s resources were good with each other; if they learned he attacked Diao Dezu’s descendant, the Phoenix Clan might kill him outright.

“Feng Zu, do you think the Beast Domain only has your resources?” Just as Feng Zu was about to summon resources, a deep voice echoed. Green dragon qi surrounded it; the Dragon Ancestor appeared in their sight.

“Huh?” Hearing the voice, people’s faces changed. They looked at the figure entering the crowd—Dragon Ancestor.

“Feng Zu, what do you mean?” Feng Zu’s face darkened as he looked at the green-cloaked Dragon Ancestor.

“Dragon Ancestor welcomes the Dragon Lord back!” The old man ignored Feng Zu’s words and stood before Long Jie, respectfully addressing him.

“What’s going on?” People were confused. They knew Long Jie, who had been staying in the Diao Clan and not in the Dragon Clan. They thought the Dragon Clan hadn’t accepted Long Jie.

This action by the Dragon Ancestor clearly indicated a situation: the Dragon Clan intended to welcome Long Jie back.

Luo Tian and others stared at the Dragon Ancestor, who showed respect. They didn’t know if it was genuine.

“Feng Zu, you once betrayed my Dragon Clan’s Lord. Earlier, you also wanted to kill me! My clan has been weak for years but always followed the ancestors’ teachings—no internal fighting among the eight major clans. We’ve been patient, but now you repeatedly want to destroy the Ghost Fang Clan and my Dragon Clan. This I cannot tolerate!” The Dragon Ancestor spoke, resolute.

“After years of patience, you think we’re easy targets? If you dare to harm the Dragon Ancestor and Diao Yuanshan’s grandson, don’t blame us for tearing our faces off and summoning the Dragon Tomb’s resources!” The Dragon Ancestor didn’t let Feng Zu respond but revealed their clan’s resources.

Resources. Among the eight major clans, the Dragon Clan was undoubtedly the strongest. However, if they truly summoned all resources, these elders wouldn’t fight since their relationships were good.

Chapter 1187: Mastering the Holy City

In the Beast Domain’s Holy City, two groups faced each other. Feng Zu’s face was grim as he looked at the Dragon Ancestor, surrounded by green qi. He hadn’t expected the Dragon Ancestor to betray them at this moment.

But who could blame him? The Phoenix Clan had indeed overstepped. They had plotted against Long Zhan Tian and, in the Fire Domain, wanted to kill the Dragon Ancestor. If successful, his strength would have declined again. Fortunately, Jiang Nanxuan arrived in time to break the crisis, allowing the Dragon Ancestor to safely return to the Beast Domain.

Feng Zu was now in a difficult position. If he didn’t summon resources, they wouldn’t match Luo Tian. If he did, and the Dragon Clan also summoned their resources, it would escalate. Ultimately, he might lose everything; if the elders learned of his actions, they might kill him outright.

Luo Tian and others stood there, their eyes showing a hint of amusement. They coldly looked at Feng Zu. In Luo Tian’s mind, this Phoenix Ancestor had to die. But for now, he didn’t want to escalate things; he needed further planning. In the future, Long Jie would certainly dominate the Beast Domain. Now that he had killed Feng Jiutian, if he also killed Feng Zu in front of many Beast Domain people, it would be bad for Long Jie’s future rule.

“Old fool! You must die today! Luo Tian, help me kill him to avenge my grandfather!” Diao Dezu spoke deeply, recalling the words of the other clans. He knew Luo Tian would help him.

“Avenging?” Luo Tian and others frowned slightly, then realized about Diao Yuanshan. They understood that Diao Dezu thought Diao Yuanshan was dead.

“Who said your master is dead?” Luo Tian spoke, his voice carrying a hint of amusement as he looked at Diao Dezu.

“Relax. Your master isn’t dead. If he were, would I be here arguing with them?” Luo Tian spoke softly, indicating Diao Yuanshan was still alive.

“Impossible! I saw my master use forbidden arts. How could he survive? It’s impossible!” Feng Zu, hearing Luo Tian’s words, showed disbelief.

Not only Feng Zu but other elders, including the Dragon Ancestor, also looked doubtful. After all, they had seen Diao Dezu use forbidden arts; how could there be a chance of survival?

“Hmph, a bunch of short-sighted fools. There’s no such thing as absolute!” Long Jie looked around at the elders, his bloodline pressure making them regain clarity.

“Not right. To survive after using forbidden arts, there’s only one possibility: the Epoch Master intervened!” One elder spoke, his voice filled with shock as he looked at Luo Tian.

Hearing this elder’s words, Luo Tian neither confirmed nor denied but gently patted Diao Dezu’s shoulder and whispered: “Don’t worry. Although your master isn’t dead, the revenge will be exacted. I’ll also avenge the thirteen Star Dragon Ants who died.”

Luo Tian’s silence stirred waves of shock. An Epoch Master, Luo Tian was protected by one. If true, no one in the nine domains would dare to challenge Luo Tian.

Thinking of Luo Tian’s strength and the previous figures like Gu Tianshu, Eastbo Xin—each appeared because of Luo Tian. Such a great power protected Luo Tian; people couldn’t help but believe that an Epoch Master truly stood behind him.

Luo Tian didn’t explain, letting people speculate. This was good; it served as a powerful deterrent.

“Which Epoch Master? How could there be one? The current era couldn’t have an Epoch Master. If so, why hasn’t he appeared?” Feng Zu still didn’t believe, his gaze on Luo Tian as he shouted.

“Crack…” But the answer was a golden hand striking him in the face, sending him flying and spitting blood.

“Old fool! Your words are too many. For the Beast Domain’s harmony, I could have killed you, but take back your old ancestor’s posture!” Luo Tian moved like lightning, his foot striking Feng Zu’s face, nearly crushing his head. Cracks appeared on Feng Zu’s head.

“You!” Seeing Luo Tian so强势, crushing him underfoot, he had always been the one to get everything in the Beast Domain. How could he have suffered such humiliation.

“Luo Tian!” Feng Zu’s heart cried out, looking at Luo Tian’s cold gaze. He trembled slightly; he felt if he resisted further, he might be killed here.

“Luo Tian, let’s talk. What conditions do you need? I’ll agree to them!” Feng Zu’s eyes flashed with coldness, suppressing his humiliation and speaking to Luo Tian.

“Oh? You’ve come to your senses?” Luo Tian noticed Feng Zu’s coldness and secretly sneered.

“Okay, from today on, the Phoenix Clan will surrender the Holy City’s ruling rights to the Dragon Clan. Can you do it?” Luo Tian smiled, looking at Feng Zu.

“What?” Feng Zu looked at Luo Tian, his heart filled with anger. The Phoenix Clan had ruled the Holy City for years; giving it up was something he couldn’t accept.

“Feng Zu, agree. A wise man doesn’t miss the opportunity!” Peng Zu whispered to Feng Zu, urging him to feign agreement. After all, Feng Zu had deep roots in the Holy City; it wasn’t easy to hand over.

“Okay! I agree. From now on, the Phoenix Clan will obey the Dragon Clan’s orders!” Feng Zu spoke with a trembling voice, his tone filled with hidden resentment.

Hearing Feng Zu’s words, the Dragon Ancestor was overjoyed. For years, the Dragon Clan’s greatest wish had been to regain control of the Holy City. Now, due to Luo Tian’s pressure, they had finally taken it back. This made the Dragon Ancestor extremely excited.

Though he knew the Dragon Clan still had difficulties in truly controlling the Holy City, this was a good beginning.

“Hmph!” Luo Tian threw Feng Zu away and stood beside Long Jie: “The rest is up to you!”

Long Jie frowned slightly, his gaze filled with authority. He stood before the Dragon Ancestor and sneered: “You once said I would be the Dragon Clan’s Lord?”

“Yes, remember when I was in the Fire Domain, you said if you didn’t die, you would be the Dragon Clan’s Lord. This still holds!” The Dragon Ancestor smiled gently at Long Jie, looking at this prodigy. The Dragon Clan’s rise was imminent.

“Sorry, I’m not interested!” But Long Jie’s words stunned the Dragon Ancestor. He hadn’t expected this prodigy to refuse the Dragon Clan’s Lord position, control of the Holy City, and even the entire Beast Domain.

People around were stunned. They didn’t know why Long Jie said this. Only Luo Tian knew what was on his mind.

Among these people, Long Jie looked the most innocent. He could easily be deceived by his appearance. But Long Jie was actually the most cunning. This boy had a special habit since childhood—loving shiny things. As he grew, this habit hadn’t disappeared but had become more intense; seeing good things made him want to possess them.

The Dragon Clan’s resources were vast, naturally containing many treasures. Long Jie would surely plunder them into his private vault before giving up.

Indeed, under people’s shock, Long Jie and the Dragon Ancestor began to exchange whispers. Long Jie’s initial disdain gradually turned into a smile, his lips curling as he nodded to the Dragon Ancestor: “Okay, I agree!”

The Dragon Ancestor sighed reluctantly. He comforted himself internally; these were all Long Jie’s future, after all, he was a prodigy. The Dragon Clan’s rise depended on him.

“Alright, let’s go. Let’s visit the Dragon Clan. I’ve never entered it since arriving in the Beast Domain!” Long Jie, hands behind his back, led Luo Tian and others confidently toward the Dragon Clan.

Watching their backs, Feng Zu stood up with a grim face. His gaze was dark and almost dripping water.

“What to do?” Peng Zu walked over, his gaze also deep. As a loyal supporter of the Phoenix Clan, he was tied to it.

“Hmph! Taking over the Holy City and Beast Domain isn’t that easy!” Feng Zu sneered. The Beast Domain’s forces were deeply entrenched; it wasn’t something that could be taken over in a day.

Luo Tian and others didn’t care about Feng Zu and Peng Zu’s plans to counter the Dragon Clan. They walked through the Beast Domain, entering the Dragon Clan under the respectful gazes of beasts—though this respect wasn’t for Luo Tian.

“Welcome to the Dragon Clan!” The Dragon Ancestor smiled, treating Luo Tian more kindly. Now that his strength was terrifying and behind him were figures like Gu Tianshu and Eastbo Xin, who were also fearsome.

They passed two golden dragon gates and entered the Dragon Clan. As soon as they arrived, the Dragon Ancestor’s voice echoed across the vast territory.

“Come out!” His authority spread. Every Dragon Clan member knew this voice. A group of figures appeared in Luo Tian’s sight.

“From today on, Long Jie is the Dragon Clan’s Lord. His status and power are equal to mine. Once I complete my cultivation, the Dragon Clan will be fully handed over to him!” The Dragon Ancestor announced after most people had arrived.

“What?” Hearing the Dragon Ancestor’s words, the Dragon Clan members’ faces changed. They looked at Long Jie.

Long Jie was known to the Dragon Clan, but a faction within it had always opposed his return. After all, the current Dragon Clan’s Lord was their faction. If Long Jie returned, his talent would be undeniable; the Lord position would naturally belong to him.

“You’ll see!” Luo Tian patted Long Jie’s shoulder, looking at the people’s expressions and speaking to him.
