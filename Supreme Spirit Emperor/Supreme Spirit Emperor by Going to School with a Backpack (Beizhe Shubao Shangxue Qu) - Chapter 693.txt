“Again!” Ye Liangchen roared, his hands sweeping through the air. Starlight trembled again, coalescing around him into a colossal scorpion.

“Crack…!” The massive pincers clamped down on the serpent’s body, slicing through it with a sharp edge of power.

Blade energy swept in all directions. The serpent’s body vanished from Luotian’s sight.

“Is this the strength of Liangchen?” Luotian stood there, watching Ye Liangchen clash with Su Tong. A sense of admiration flickered in Luotian’s eyes. Ye Liangchen’s power was undoubtedly among the top of the Immortal King early stage.

“Why didn’t Ye Sheng come?” At the same time, Luotian turned his gaze toward Ye Wudao and Ye Tian. The two were desperately fighting against Xutian Daoist, their endurance waning. Each attack from the four opponents left Ye Wudao and Ye Tian bleeding.

“Do you not believe in me?”

“But it’s not as if you’d let your father-in-law and others face danger!” Luotian muttered to himself, his heart filled with anxiety.

Ye Wudao, Ye Tian, and Ye Liangchen were clearly outmatched by these opponents. Luotian did not want them to die for him in vain.

As Luotian pondered, a thunderous explosion echoed. Ye Liangchen’s scorpion form shattered, and he flew backward with a pale face, landing before Luotian.

“Liangchen!” Luotian caught Ye Liangchen, watching him with a smile as Shen Suanszi approached.

“Tian Ge, can you move? If so, leave first!” Ye Liangchen wiped the blood from his lips, his body trembling. The two confrontations had left him severely wounded.

“I can’t!” Luotian spoke softly. Though Ye Tian had given him a pill, his injuries were too severe. Luotian estimated he needed about a quarter of an hour to recover.

“A quarter of an hour?” Ye Liangchen’s face hardened with determination. His hands moved swiftly, stars gathering again. He stepped on the stars and charged toward Su Tong once more.

Roar…

This time, stars enveloped Ye Liangchen, transforming him into a massive bull. Silver hooves slammed toward Su Tong.

Su Tong remained calm, his long sword surging outward. He gripped the blade with both hands and slashed downward.

The thunderous sound returned, a gray sword beam slicing through the bull. Yet this time, the bull shattered vast waves of divine light but still charged toward Su Tong.

“Hmph…” Su Tong’s expression shifted slightly. He hadn’t expected this outcome. Two gray hands materialized before him, grasping at the silver horns.

Boom… Boom…

The collision echoed. Su Tong was thrown backward, his mouth finally spitting blood. The silver bull shattered again.

“Again!”

“Haha! Shen Suanszi, what are you now?” Ye Liangchen’s face was pale but he laughed. The stars erupted, converging toward the charging Ye Liangchen—but this time, the starlight was dim.

“Indeed, you have some skill. I never expected that!” Su Tong wiped his lips, eyes filled with admiration.

“But this time, I won’t be so careless. I’ve had enough!” Su Tong’s smile deepened. His aura surged, a gray mist enveloping him and solidifying into form.

A thousand-zhang-tall figure of gray materialized, eyes cold. His body radiated an ancient aura. A massive pressure surged outward as he raised his fist, slamming it toward Ye Liangchen.

One punch shook the heavens. The overwhelming aura shattered the stars gathering toward Ye Liangchen, crushing him.

Ye Liangchen plummeted like a meteor, crashing into the ground. A deep pit formed beneath him.

Luotian clenched his fists, watching Ye Liangchen fall. His hands cracked audibly as he walked toward him.

“This sky is quite good!” Su Tong raised his hand, striking the dark heavens. His punch shattered the night sky, stars collapsing and revealing a deep blue one.

On another side, Ye Wudao and Ye Tian’s eyes were bloodshot. They struggled desperately, their forms battered beyond recognition.

“Die!” Shen Suanszi’s gaze turned toward Luotian. His sole purpose was to kill Luotian, so he ignored Ye Liangchen’s fate and launched a punch toward Luotian.

“Want to kill my elder brother? You’re dreaming!” Just as the punch flew toward Luotian, Ye Liangchen seemed to have a final burst of strength. He appeared before Luotian.

“Let’s end it together!” Shen Suanszi showed no reaction. This punch could obliterate the severely wounded Ye Liangchen and Luotian.

“Elder Brother, stand behind me!” Ye Liangchen roared. A destruction aura erupted from his body.

“Liangchen, don’t be reckless! Uncle is here!” Just as Ye Liangchen prepared to fight, a desperate voice echoed through the heavens.

The sky cracked open. A silver hand emerged from the heavens, grasping Su Tong’s fist.

Crack…

Thunderous sound echoed. The silver hand clamped onto the gray fist, shattering it instantly. A storm swept into the void, and a figure passed through the storm, appearing before Luotian and Ye Liangchen. It was Xinghe Fu, Ye Sheng.

Chapter 2591: Zhou Li()

A towering figure radiated an overwhelming aura. His eyes glowed with cold light, gazing at Su Tong from afar.

The number one strength of Xinghe Fu, Ye Sheng—Ye Wudao and Ye Tian’s elder brother, the pillar of Xinghe Fu.

Ye Sheng had met Su Tong before. The relationship between Xinghe Fu and Butian Mountain was too close, so Ye Sheng knew about Su Tong, the genius disciple of Butian Mountain.

Ye Sheng had originally not wanted to get involved. After all, Luotian was struggling in the Immortal realm. But Ye Wudao and Ye Tian, along with Ye Liangchen, insisted on interfering.

To this matter, Ye Sheng had even argued fiercely with the three. But in the end, they left.

Ye Sheng had no choice but to follow secretly. Though he was cold-hearted, these three were his blood relatives—especially Ye Liangchen, the sole heir of the Ye family. He could not allow Ye Liangchen to die. Thus, he stepped forward.

“Liangchen, take this boy and leave first!” Ye Sheng’s gaze was cautious as he addressed Ye Liangchen.

“Uncle, be careful!” Tears glistened in Ye Liangchen’s eyes. He grabbed Luotian, attempting to fly away.

“Split up! One of you block Ye Sheng!” Shen Suanszi frowned, addressing Zhao Gengxu and Tong Tieyi who were attacking Ye Tian.

“Good!” Tong Tieyi leaped into the air, standing beside Shen Suanszi. Ye Tian was already nearing his limit.

“Today, he must die. If you leave now, I won’t harm you!” Su Tong addressed Ye Sheng.

“Little one, what are you?” Ye Sheng coldly replied. Since he had stepped forward, there was nothing more to say.

An Immortal King mid-stage aura erupted. He raised his hand, a black sky pressing down on Shen Suanszi and Tong Tieyi.

“Want to leave? You can’t!” Shen Suanszi leaped into the air, his aura overwhelming. He charged toward the black sky.

“Little one, you are still a little one!” Tong Tieyi’s eyes showed disdain. Though Ye Sheng was an Immortal King mid-stage, he was who? A peer of the nine Immortal Kings. Though he was an early-stage Immortal King, he did not fear facing Ye Sheng alone.

Two thunderous roars echoed. Tong Tieyi and Shen Suanszi burst through the dark sky, appearing before Ye Sheng.

Tong Tieyi’s body was surrounded by green energy, forming a green armor that radiated cold light. His iron fist rose and smashed toward Ye Sheng.

Shen Suanszi rushed toward the fleeing Ye Liangchen and Luotian, slashing a sword beam.

“Get out of my way!” Ye Liangchen sensed the danger behind him and turned abruptly. Starlight coalesced into a long sword, clashing with Shen Suanszi’s blade.

“Come back!” Ye Sheng’s face darkened. He punched, colliding with Tong Tieyi’s iron fist. His body trembled and was thrown back but used the冲击 to charge toward Shen Suanszi.

“Old dog, are you really seeking death?” Shen Suanszi turned abruptly and slashed his sword toward Ye Sheng.

Ye Sheng formed a seal with one hand. A meteor fell from the sky, shattering Shen Suanszi’s blade and then turning to strike Tong Tieyi’s green hand.

However, Ye Sheng’s face was slightly purpled. His blood surged as he had sustained some injuries from Tong Tieyi’s punch.

On the other side, Ye Liangchen, needing to protect Luotian and suffering severe wounds himself, shattered his star sword before him. A gray blade slashed across Ye Liangchen’s body.

Blood spewed out. This strike nearly split Ye Liangchen in two, the wound deep and leaving him swaying before finally collapsing with Luotian from the sky.

The situation remained tense. The odds were still against Luotian’s group. Ye Wudao and Ye Tian could no longer endure, their bodies covered in blood with countless wounds.

Ye Sheng faced two opponents—Su Tong and Tong Tieyi, both formidable. They were capable of clashing with an Immortal King mid-stage.

“What to do? What to do?”

“I can’t watch them die!” Luotian’s heart was anxious, thinking of solutions.

Just as Luotian was desperate, a figure flew toward him and the others, carrying pressure.

“Another one has arrived. Definitely not my ally!” Luotian’s anxiety deepened, as no one else in the Immortal realm stood with him besides Xinghe Fu and Butian Mountain.

“I can help. I still have my soul!” Luotian’s eyes flashed with madness. His cultivation and body were ruined, but his soul remained intact.

Soul Blade!

He acted immediately. A gray soul blade appeared above Luotian, radiating waves of power. His gaze turned toward the battlefield.

Luotian pointed his finger. The gray soul blade vanished, piercing through space toward Ye Wudao.

“Soul!” Seeing Luotian’s soul blade, Xu Tian Daoist and Leng Wuxin’s expressions slightly shifted.

“But we are the strongest in soul power!” Xu Tian Daoist chuckled, forming a seal. A gray soul sword erupted, clashing with Luotian’s soul blade.

“Again!” Luotian didn’t care anymore. He knew this could relieve Ye Wudao’s pressure, as Ye Wudao looked ready to fall.

Powerful soul energy continuously formed into soul blades, slicing toward Xu Tian Daoist and Leng Wuxin.

Though Luotian’s soul attacks disturbed Xu Tian Daoist and Leng Wuxin, it was only a nuisance. They had lived too long; their soul power was formidable. Luotian’s soul, though strong, was only on par with theirs.

As they clashed repeatedly, the figure Luotian had sensed finally appeared. Seeing it, Luotian’s heart sank instantly.

“Zhou Li!” Luotian never expected to meet Zhou Li here, at this life-or-death moment.

“My beloved master, I’ve come specifically for you!” Zhou Li smiled, his hand sweeping. Black light flashed, and a black sword appeared in his grasp.

“Longyuan!” Luotian’s face darkened, watching Zhou Li with triumph. It was Zhou Li who had caused him to expose himself, forcing him to face the Immortal King of Eternal Life.

“Unexpectedly, you’ve reached this point. So pitiful!” Zhou Li saw Luotian’s state and sneered.

“Longyuan, come here!” Luotian barked. Though Longyuan was not in his hand, he could still feel that he remained the master of Longyuan.

Zhou Li’s black sword trembled violently, radiating waves of divine light. It wanted to fly toward Luotian.

Chapter 2592: Blood Lord Awakens()

“Return! Your current master is me!” Zhou Li roared, his hand sweeping. An invisible wave affected Longyuan, making it tremble again and hover in the air.

“Everything you have will belong to me!” Zhou Li’s eyes flashed with madness. Luotian was his obsession; without Luotian, he wouldn’t have reached this point. Zhou Li needed to kill Luotian to validate his path.

“My things are never easily taken!” Luotian’s face darkened. He was truly cornered now, his body and cultivation destroyed, even his soul drained.

“You have no right to say that!” Zhou Li stepped forward like a supreme ruler. He wanted to humiliate and crush Luotian, only finding joy in his suffering—a twisted psychology.

Each step Zhou Li took brought immense pressure upon Luotian, increasing the burden on him. Luotian stood on the ground, struggling to keep his body from trembling. He couldn’t lose face before Zhou Li.

But as Zhou Li approached, the pressure on Luotian grew. Cold sweat streamed down his forehead, yet his body remained upright like a mountain.

“Tian Ge!” Ye Liangchen, pale-faced, stood up and joined Luotian, sharing the pressure.

“Luotian, kneel! Beg for my mercy!” Zhou Li stopped ten zhang away. He held the Longyuan sword, gazing at Luotian with dominance.

“Dream on!” Luotian chuckled, his face filled with mockery. Though he was in a pitiful state, he wasn’t someone Zhou Li could insult.

“If you don’t kneel, I have many ways to make you!” Zhou Li’s eyes flickered. He turned his gaze toward Ye Liangchen, raising his sword.

A dark blade slashed out, instantly striking Ye Liangchen. His arm was severed by Zhou Li’s attack.

“Hmph…” Ye Liangchen’s face paled. His forehead veins trembled, and he let out a soft sound. He stared at Zhou Li with fierce eyes.

“You…” Luotian’s face darkened to the extreme. Seeing Ye Liangchen’s severed arm spilling blood, a furious killing intent gathered in his eyes. But he knew now was not the time to fight Zhou Li.

“Kneel, or I’ll chop off another arm and your legs one by one!” Zhou Li glared at Luotian, knowing his weakness.

“Tian Ge, don’t!” Ye Liangchen smiled, his lips devoid of color. He fell to the ground.

“Little bastard! If you have the guts, kill me. A small person wants to sit on our brothers’ backs? You can’t even dream of it!” Ye Liangchen laughed, his voice filled with contempt.

“Boom…” The answer was another arm severed. Ye Liangchen lay on the ground, blood staining the earth beneath him.

Two arms completely severed. Luotian watched Ye Liangchen’s pitiful state, his lips bleeding as he felt a lump in his chest.

“Don’t worry. It’s just two arms. Once I recover, I’ll definitely skin and flay this kid!” Ye Liangchen chuckled, gazing at Zhou Li.

“You reminded me!” Zhou Li heard Ye Liangchen’s words and raised his sword again. Ye Liangchen’s feet erupted with blood, his tendons severed by Zhou Li.

“Stop!” Luotian’s eyes turned red. He gazed at Zhou Li with a wild aura, his cold gaze making Zhou Li shiver. But upon seeing Luotian’s pitiful state, he smiled again.

“Do you want to kneel? It's too late. This time, you must also bow. One bow and I’ll spare one of his meridians!” Zhou Li spoke, and another flower of blood bloomed on Ye Liangchen.

“You dare to die!” Luotian roared, his red aura bursting out. Coldness filled him as he took out the blood knife.

Blood energy surrounded the blade, entering Luotian’s body. His entire appearance became terrifyingly brutal.

“How did I just wake up? You’ve already turned into this!” The voice of the Blood Lord echoed in Luotian’s mind.

“Help me!” Luotian said only two words. Blood seals surrounded him, etched into his body.

“Ah… I guess I have to sleep again!” A resigned voice echoed. The Blood Lord’s sword erupted with terrifying blood energy, pouring into Luotian’s body.

The Blood Lord, Tu Tian, awoke. As soon as Luotian felt Tu Tian’s awakening, he used the blood energy to perform the Heaven-Devil Body Break.

Pulsing blood energy instantly flooded Luotian’s body, replacing his original cultivation. A smile finally appeared on Luotian’s face.

This smile caught Zhou Li’s eye and the pressure from Luotian made him shiver.

Boom…

Blood waves surged. Luotian’s aura rapidly escalated, and he performed the Heaven-Devil Body Break again. He didn’t know what consequences it would bring, but he no longer cared.

True Immortal late stage… True Immortal peak…

“Kill!” Seeing Luotian’s aura increase, Zhou Li raised his Longyuan sword and slashed toward Luotian.

“It's too late!” A cold voice echoed from Luotian. His blood sword rose above his head.

Boom…

The earth trembled beneath Luotian, and his aura stabilized at the Immortal King early stage.

“Kill…” Luotian stepped on the ground, exploding with power. His body transformed into a streak of blood light, rushing toward Zhou Li.

“Waste!” As Luotian charged, Su Tong and others saw the situation. Su Tong cursed under his breath.

If Zhou Li had killed Luotian immediately, there would be no problem. Su Tong had calculated this opportunity to kill Luotian perfectly but hadn’t expected so many twists.

Crack…

Thunderous sound echoed through the heavens. The blood sword clashed with Longyuan, and Zhou Li was instantly thrown back, spitting out blood.

Though Zhou Li was strong, he was still far behind Luotian. He was completely crushed by Luotian.

While flying back, Zhou Li’s back emitted waves of energy. A black and white pair of wings unfolded, trembling slightly. They created a storm that devastated the heavens, rushing toward Luotian’s blood energy.

Luotian showed no concern. At this moment, he had only one thought: to make Zhou Li suffer and die. He raised his sword, slicing through the storm, breaking it apart and appearing before Zhou Li.

“Wum…” The blood sword slashed again, splitting the sky and descending upon Zhou Li’s head.

Chapter 2593: Battle Against Three Strong Opponents()

Zhou Li’s face was pale. Instinctively, he raised his Longyuan sword to block Luotian’s furious strike.

“Crack…” A thunderous sound rose from above Zhou Li. He was thrown to the ground, his Longyuan sword barely held and flew away.

“Boom…” Dust surged. Zhou Li crashed into the ground. Luotian stood in the sky, his hand sweeping. He performed the Eight Directions Falling Treasure Technique, and Longyuan sword emitted a sound of struggle, instantly returning to Luotian’s hand.

“Old comrade!” Luotian gripped Longyuan. He immediately felt it was sealed by an enchantment.

“Can such a seal hold you?” Luotian smiled slightly. He pointed his finger, and the sword emitted a humming sound, trembling.

The feeling of blood connection instantly appeared in Luotian’s perception. At the same time, his body flashed and became a streak of light, appearing above Zhou Li who had crashed into the ground.

“This thing isn’t yours!” Luotian raised his hand, grabbing the black wings with a blood-colored hand.

“Boom…” Blood spewed from Zhou Li’s back. The black wings fell into Luotian’s hand, still stained with blood.

“Ah…” Zhou Li screamed. He flew up, trying to escape. Facing such a Luotian, he had no will to fight.

“Can’t run!” Luotian raised his sword and slashed Zhou Li’s legs. At the same time, he waved his hand, summoning a great cauldron to crush Zhou Li.

Luotian’s face showed coldness. He spoke: “It's been years since I was so angry. Truly, it’s been a long time since I felt this anger!”

Luotian’s hand trembled. His eyes turned blood-red. He pulled out the other white wing.

“I’ll keep you for my brothers to deal with!” Luotian slashed, severing Zhou Li’s arms. He also unleashed divine laws to seal and capture Zhou Li.

“Doomed Wings, purify yourself. With your blood, I find it dirty!” Luotian coldly spoke. His gaze turned toward the battlefield where Su Tong and Ye Wudao were.

“Uncle!” Luotian’s eyes slightly trembled. He watched Ye Wudao and Ye Tian, both covered in blood and barely standing.

Their bodies revealed large bones. They were about to be killed. Xu Tian Daoist had raised his hand, reaching for Ye Wudao’s heart.

A blood vortex appeared beneath Luotian. He transformed into a streak of light, instantly appearing before Ye Wudao. His speed was unprecedented.

“Get out…” A blood sword slashed, precisely appearing before Xu Tian Daoist’s arm.

“Hmph?” Xu Tian Daoist’s eyes narrowed. He quickly withdrew his hand, and the blood sword barely passed by.

At the same time, Luotian appeared before Ye Wudao. His other hand held Longyuan, and he slashed a sword beam toward Cold Wuxin who appeared behind Ye Wudao.

Cold Wuxin retreated, his eyes filled with caution. Luotian escorted Ye Wudao to the ground.

“You’ve grown old!” Ye Wudao, covered in blood and with his head nearly severed, was pitiful.

“Uncle, rest. I’ll take over!” Luotian addressed Ye Tian, who was equally battered.

“Your goal wasn’t to kill me?” Luotian placed Ye Tian beside Ye Liangchen, addressing Xu Tian Daoist and Cold Wuxin.

Ye Sheng was temporarily safe. If Luotian eliminated these three, the balance would tip in their favor.

Xu Tian Daoist and Cold Wuxin had already suffered injuries from fighting each other. They had also fought against Su Tong, sustaining more damage. Then they clashed with Ye Wudao in a prolonged battle. Obviously, their energy was depleted. Only Zhao Gengxu remained.

Though Luotian had only recovered to the Immortal King early stage, he had some confidence. Normally, he might have avoided fighting, fearing unexpected events. But this time, Luotian was truly angry. Seeing Ye Liangchen, Ye Wudao, and Ye Tian’s pitiful state, if it weren’t for the Blood Lord awakening, his life would have already been lost. He would have also taken Ye Wudao and the others with him.

Body of the Universe!

Luotian immediately activated his divine body. Blood armor covered his massive form. He kicked toward Zhao Gengxu, who was attacking Ye Tian.

“Little one, what are you? An Immortal King early stage dare to fight us?” Zhao Gengxu didn’t take Luotian’s fierce kick seriously. His green sword turned, its blade oddly thin.

Zhao Gengxu’s state was still good. He wasn’t afraid of Luotian, as in their eyes, their enemies were only those from their own era.

The green sword was silent. Though weak, it struck Luotian’s outstretched foot.

Traces appeared on Luotian’s foot. Pain spread, and he retreated.

“Little one, you don’t respect us at all!” As Luotian retreated, his back was suddenly attacked. A figure appeared behind him, a blood-colored spear piercing Luotian’s back.

The spear was incredibly fast. Even faster than Luotian’s Yellow Spring Step, beyond what a cultivator could achieve.

The spear pierced through both Luotian’s blood-energy-enhanced Momo Armor and his divine body.

“Puff…” Blood spewed from Luotian’s shoulder. His face darkened. He took a second step, stomping toward Zhao Gengxu with his fierce kick. At the same time, his blood eyes glowed golden, activating the Golden Wheel Thunder Eye.

“They’re cooperating!” Luotian instantly realized it was Xu Tian Daoist and Cold Wuxin working together. One used the Void Path to enhance, while the other unleashed the Life-Devouring Technique. It was perfect.

Boom…

This time, Luotian retreated several steps and took his third step. As he moved, Cold Wuxin and Xu Tian Daoist’s attacks struck again, adding another flower of blood to Luotian’s shoulder.

“My Thunder Eye could only see a trace!” Luotian was shocked. He hadn’t expected these two to still threaten him after so many battles.

“I won’t believe it!” Luotian took steps again, stomping toward Zhao Gengxu. He knew if he could suppress Zhao Gengxu, he had a chance to win. As for Xu Tian Daoist and Cold Wuxin’s combined attack, Luotian could avoid the vital points with his Thunder Eye. Finally, Luotian reached his seventh step. Seven leg images made Zhao Gengxu’s face change, watching the crushing thigh. Zhao Gengxu felt immense pressure. Luotian’s body had several blood holes.

Chapter 2594: Killing()

A thick foot slammed down, making Zhao Gengxu’s face pale. He could feel the overwhelming pressure in this kick.

Green sword energy surged skyward, radiating immense divine power. It slashed toward the crushing foot.

Boom…

The thunderous sound echoed, dust swirling and shaking the heavens. Luotian and Zhao Gengxu’s figures were engulfed by the storm.

Luotian’s divine body shattered, blood spewing from his mouth. His body flew backward but he didn’t dare to be careless because an endless cold killing intent surrounded him.

The void tore open. Cold Wuxin held a blood spear stained with Luotian’s blood, piercing toward his back. The cold killing intent made Luotian feel like he was sinking into mud.

“Wandao Duzun!” Luotian roared, turning and punching with Wandao Duzun enhancing his fist. He countered Cold Wuxin’s Life-Devouring Technique.

Luotian naturally understood the Dao better than these people. Even with nine regions’ years of life, he hadn’t lived as long as them. But Wandao Duzun was a technique Luotian had领悟 from watching the heavenly court’s people sealing the sky. Its essence was higher than Cold Wuxin and Xu Tian Daoist’s Dao.

A fist pierced through the void, colliding with the blood spear. Luotian’s fist had a blood hole, and Cold Wuxin was also thrown back by his punch, spitting blood.

Boom Boom Boom…

At the same time, three void blades struck Luotian’s chest. Three blood marks appeared on his chest.

“Yi Jian Lingxian!” Longyuan surged. Luotian seemed to feel none of the three wounds, raising his hand and slashing a sword technique toward Zhao Gengxu who had just been crushed to the ground.

The sword energy was overwhelming, like splitting the sky. Black sword light appeared above Zhao Gengxu.

Crack…

Zhao Gengxu saw the black sword light and his face changed. He felt a strong danger in it.

“Damn fool, why didn’t you just kill him earlier!” Zhao Gengxu cursed in his mind. He spat blood onto the green sword, a sharp and fierce aura spreading. It collided with Luotian’s sword light.

Burst…

Blade energy and sword light clashed, shattering on Zhao Gengxu’s body. Zhao Gengxu spat blood again.

“Zhu Xian Jianzhen!” Luotian didn’t relax. He put away Longyuan and the blood sword, taking up the broken Zhu Xian Jian in his hand. His body continuously moved.

Six hundred sword lights appeared instantly. Luotian’s speed was so fast that Xu Tian Daoist couldn’t catch up. It was because Luotian’s movement was too strange, not following conventional methods.

Destructive and world-shaking waves came from the sky. Luotian stood in the sword array, surrounded by sword light, finally feeling safe.

The sword array fell from the sky. Its target was still Zhao Gengxu. Xu Tian Daoist and Cold Wuxin stood at a distance, watching the terrifying sword array.

“This is… Zhu Xian Jianzhen!” They had lived too long to not have heard of the legend of Zhu Xian Jianzhen. They had also heard about the top-tier immortal, Qijue Sani of the heavenly court.

“Help me!” Seeing these countless terrifying sword lights, Zhao Gengxu’s face turned pale. A feeling of helplessness arose in him.

“Can’t help. You block it for a while. We two are in bad shape and can’t last long!” Xu Tian Daoist and Cold Wuxin spoke but didn’t act.

“Die!” Luotian descended from the sky, like a sword out of its sheath. He crushed down with an overwhelming sword array.

“Wum…” The void trembled. Next, dozens of sword lights instantly swept toward Zhao Gengxu. Zhao Gengxu continuously swung his green sword, countering each sword light.

Burst… Burst…

Each sword light shattered before Zhao Gengxu, but four hands couldn’t fight against many. Each sword was incredibly strong.

In an instant, the sword lights pierced Zhao Gengxu’s body, gradually penetrating through his entire body.

“Ten Thousand Sword Penetrates the Heart!”

Zhao Gengxu’s face showed regret as he fell. His soul was also destroyed by the powerful Zhu Xian Jianzhen, and his body lay on the ground.

“Boom…” Blood splattered. The sight of blood stained the ground, and Zhao Gengxu disappeared entirely.

“This…” Xu Tian Daoist and Cold Wuxin stared in shock. They watched the sword array, which was weakened but still formidable.

“Run…” Without thinking, Xu Tian Daoist and Cold Wuxin fled with默契. They had only verbally agreed to follow Su Tong, without any oaths. Long life was good, but they didn’t believe Su Tong had real long-life secrets. Now their state couldn’t withstand such a terrifying Zhu Xian Jianzhen.

“Did they run?”

“Next time, you won’t have a chance to escape!” Luotian didn’t care about the fleeing Xu Tian Daoist and Cold Wuxin. He activated the sword array, rushing toward Ye Sheng’s group.

“Damn!” Shen Suanszi’s face was terrible. He hadn’t expected Luotian to turn the tables.

“Retreat!” Facing the array of myriad swords, Shen Suanszi and Tong Tieyi had no confidence. Plus there was Ye Sheng.

They pushed back Ye Sheng, flew up, and tried to leave. But Luotian wouldn’t let them go so easily.

The sword array poured down instantly, a terrifying wave. Ye Sheng’s face showed shock. He hadn’t expected Luotian to have such a powerful technique.

“I won’t stop you if I want to leave!” Shen Suanszi’s face showed a cold smile. Luotian was strong, he knew now he couldn’t kill Luotian because some chances were lost. But Luotian’s current state could not kill him.

“Turn the situation!” Shen Suanszi’s hands moved swiftly. Invisible waves flew from his hands.

Numerous divine seals emerged, like gray dragons. They surrounded Shen Suanszi’s body.

The heavens and earth energy condensed. A tall figure appeared, holding a gray sword. It slashed toward the Zhu Xian Jianzhen.

Boom Boom Boom…

The thunderous sound rose instantly. The sword light collided with the Zhu Xian Jianzhen, and sword energy spread everywhere.

Luotian’s eyes slightly narrowed. He took out the Wheel of Transcendence, scattering true divine light to protect himself and Ye Sheng.

The storm hit the barrier for dozens of breaths before calming. The ground was in ruins, and Shen Suanszi and Tong Tieyi disappeared from Luotian’s sight.

“Brave indeed!” Luotian sighed, watching the red bloodstains left at their previous position. He had to admit that Shen Suanszi was a terrifying enemy. This time, he almost failed.

“Your luck is tough!” Ye Sheng wiped his lips, watching Luotian with admiration.

Chapter 2595: Return to Tiantian Sect()

“Luck is just luck!” Luotian sighed, walking with Ye Sheng toward Ye Wudao and Ye Liangchen.

“You leave. They are severely wounded. I need to take them back!” Ye Sheng spoke softly, his resentment toward Luotian was strong. If it weren’t for Luotian, Ye Wudao and the others wouldn’t have been in this state.

“I won’t forget this great favor!” Luotian bowed to Ye Sheng. Regardless of Ye Sheng’s motives, he had helped Luotian.

“Tian Ge, don’t say such useless things!”
