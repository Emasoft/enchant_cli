Luo Tian showed no fear, his body vanishing from the spot in an instant before appearing before Sun Shaohui. He launched a punch with devastating force.

"Get out..." sensing Luo Tian's speed, Sun Shaohui's face shifted, but he remained unflustered. He had already known of Luo Tian's terrifying speed during his clash with Kong Mingzi, suspecting that Luo Tian had mastered the first Dao of space.

As the second-ranked prodigy of the Blue Dragon Sect, Sun Shaohui was no fool. A mocking smile played on his lips as he launched a punch in return.

"Crack..." The once-quiet Blue Dragon arena erupted with thunderous roars.

Luo Tian's body twisted, his face etched with grim determination. Earlier when he faced the second-origin supreme of the White Tiger Sect, he had realized his current strength still lagged behind that of a second-origin supreme.

"Can't let him attack!" As Luo Tian retreated, he suddenly halted, his frail body infused with spatial power before reappearing before Sun Shaohui.

"Speed is good, but power... isn't enough!" Sun Shaohui remained indifferent as he launched another punch. This time, he unleashed his full strength, stars swirling around him like a meteor colliding with Luo Tian's fist.

"Star attribute?" Luo Tian was sent flying again, crashing into the Blue Dragon Sect's barrier. This time, blood trickled from his lips.

"Imperial Seal!" Luo Tian moved his hands slightly, and the Imperial Seal materialized instantly, radiating imperial aura as it crushed toward Sun Shaohui.

"Trivial trick!" Sun Shaohui's face remained calm as he launched another punch imbued with star energy.

A sudden surge of blue light erupted, like a meteor streaking across the sky. The Blue Dragon barrier trembled as it collided with the Imperial Seal.

"Boom..." In one punch, the Imperial Seal shattered before everyone's eyes. The invisible shockwaves scattered Luo Tian and Sun Shaohui's robes.

"He's too far behind! Although Luo Tian is powerful, against a second-origin supreme like Sun Shaohui, he's still lacking!"

"A servant dares to trouble Senior Sun? Now he's lost his life!"

"Ah, Sun Shaohui has mastered both star and wind Dao. His body already contains two original sources. But Luo Tian only grasped one spatial Dao. This time, Luo Tian overestimated himself!" Sima Qiong stood among the crowd, his face showing a hint of regret.

"Luo Tian won't lose!" Zhang Qingsheng's face hardened with determination, a strange confidence rising within him.

"Hmph. How can you be so sure?" Sima Qiong's expression turned intrigued as he looked at Zhang Qingsheng.

"Feeling!" Zhang Qingsheng replied, leaving Sima Qiong speechless, nearly spitting blood.

"Master, would you like to bet again? If you win, you'll recoup. If you lose, you'll owe more debt!" Zhang Qingsheng looked at Sima Qiong with hope.

The two began whispering amidst the crowd, Sima Qiong's eyes flickering between excitement and furrowed brows.

"Bet! Damn it!" Finally, Sima Qiong gritted his teeth and stomped his foot, shouting loudly to the crowd.

"I'll continue as bookmaker. Bet Luo Tian wins at even odds. Bet Sima Qiong wins at two-to-one, no limit!" Sima Qiong bellowed, his eyes reflecting the madness of a gambler.

"What?" The Blue Dragon Sect disciples heard Sima Qiong's words, as if they hadn't caught it. They listened again, their faces lighting up with excitement.

After Zhang Qingsheng's persuasion, Sima Qiong decided to make a bold gamble. Upon hearing the odds, he knew he was betting on Luo Tian's victory.

Such tempting odds left no one unmoved. Sima Qiong was certain his bet would cause chaos within the Blue Dragon Sect.

"I bet on Senior Sun's victory... I wager one million on Senior Sun's win!" The disciples of the Blue Dragon Sect shouted as they rushed toward Sima Qiong, constantly placing storage bags before him.

Not only that, even disciples who hadn't come to watch the spectacle emerged from their courtyards to approach Sima Qiong. The Blue Dragon Sect disciples flocked toward him.

Sun Shaohui's lips twitched as he watched the crowd rushing to the Blue Dragon arena. He hadn't expected Sima Qiong's bold move, and what infuriated him was that Sima Qiong had even bet on his loss.

Sima Qiong's lips twitched as he summoned all his attendants to collect the bets, his heart trembling: "Luo Tian, you must win!"

The entire Blue Dragon Sect's wealth had gathered into Sima Qiong's hands, but he knew if Luo Tian lost, he couldn't escape the wrath of all Blue Dragon Sect disciples.

After an hour's duration, the Blue Dragon arena betting ended. All Blue Dragon Sect disciples looked at the two combatants with anticipation, none believing Luo Tian would win.

"Sima Qiong, you're known for your gambling. I didn't expect you to be so reckless. This time, you'll have to spend the next few thousand years repaying this massive debt!" Sun Shaohui's face bore mockery.

"Win or lose is my business. But you, don't trip up!" Others feared Sun Shaohui, but Sima Qiong didn't. Seeing Sun Shaohui's mockery, he coldly retaliated.

"Hmph!"

"Now it's my turn!" Sun Shaohui sneered, his cold gaze fixed on Luo Tian.

"Kill!" Before Luo Tian could respond, Sun Shaohui transformed into a golden meteor, his speed so extreme it caused the arena's stable space to crack.

Luo Tian's gaze darkened, his steps shifting into the Sealing Heaven Step, instantly appearing at a distance.

"Shadow!" Sun Shaohui launched a punch but only struck Luo Tian's shadow, leaving him astonished.

"Kid, you just run away? I'll see how long you can dodge here! Star-Quelling Seal!" Sun Shaohui moved his hands, and countless meteors rained from the sky, their heavy aura crushing down on the arena.

"Can't dodge!" Seeing the dense meteors filling the entire arena, each with terrifying power, Luo Tian's heart trembled.

Knowing he couldn't escape, Luo Tian's eyes flashed with coldness. His nine-colored meridians surged with chaotic energy as a nine-color domain formed before him.

"Nine-Attribute Body Type!" The Blue Dragon Sect disciples' faces showed shock. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to possess such a terrifying nine-attribute body.

"What? How could this talent be just a servant!" People murmured, unable to fathom such potential being confined as a mere attendant.

"Ah?" When Luo Tian's nine-color barrier flared, the Grand Master of the Blue Dragon Sect's cave suddenly opened. The elder master's eyes snapped open, his gaze fixed on the Blue Dragon arena.

"Nine-Attribute Body Type? What good is it? You've offended me. Today, you must die! Wind Origin!" Sun Shaohui's face twisted with cruelty, ignoring Luo Tian's body type. Countless blue auras burst from his body, rapidly attaching to the descending meteors.

"Ugh..." The already devastating meteors, now infused with wind attribute energy, seemed to gain fuel. They roared with thunderous sounds, rushing toward the Blue Dragon arena.

Chapter 754: The Peril of the Binding Soul Band

Chapter 754: The Peril of the Binding Soul Band

At the Blue Dragon Arena, countless meteors continuously descended, smashing against Luo Tian's nine-color barrier with deafening roars.

"Crack..." The clear sound echoed as Luo Tian's nine-color barrier, though powerful, could not withstand the meteors' impact.

"Boom..." Countless meteors filled the entire Blue Dragon Arena, forming a mountain that appeared before everyone's eyes.

"Pathetic! That's all you've got to challenge Senior Sun?" The Blue Dragon Sect disciples' faces showed contempt, their gazes on the buried Luo Tian.

"Did this kid even escape his soul?" One disciple murmured softly.

"He's tough. A normal first-origin supreme would have died already!"

Sun Shaohui's face showed contempt as he sighed.

"Roar..." A thunderous roar echoed, nine-color energy continuously gathering above the mountain. Nine colors of energy circled in the sky before coalescing into a nine-color, resplendent tiger with crimson eyes emitting bloodthirsty light.

"White Tiger Transformation!" A cold voice echoed from beneath the mountain, followed by terrifying waves emanating from its depths.

"Boom..." The meteor mountain exploded with a thunderous sound, debris scattering outward and colliding with the Blue Dragon Arena's surrounding barriers.

A battered figure appeared before everyone's eyes. Luo Tian slowly stood up, his gaze filled with endless battle spirit. His body emitted a series of cracking sounds as broken bones returned to their places.

"Roar..." The nine-color tiger circling the sky, upon seeing Luo Tian, seemed to find its host. Its crimson eyes flashed with red light before it let out a low growl and rushed toward Luo Tian.

"This is the White Tiger Sect's White Tiger Transformation. How could Luo Tian possess this technique!" The Blue Dragon Sect disciples' faces showed confusion, their gazes toward Luo Tian filled with hostility.

The four continents of the Four Sacred Star Domains had always been uneasy. Disciples often clashed, and now Luo Tian's use of the White Tiger Transformation suggested a deep connection with the White Tiger Sect. The White Tiger Transformation was only accessible to the sect's direct disciples.

At this moment, people connected Luo Tian's nine-attribute body and his astonishing wealth bet to suspect he was a wandering cultivator, but it seemed more like a genius from another sect.

Luo Tian, however, was unaware of the Blue Dragon Sect disciples' thoughts. The nine-color tiger flowed into his body, and Luo Tian's aura suddenly erupted with thunderous sounds from the nine-color energy surrounding him.

"Second-Origin Supreme! Just missing the understanding of original source Dao!" Jiang Sixi's face showed admiration as he gazed at Luo Tian. He hadn't expected such talent in Luo Tian. If Luo Tian had possessed this strength earlier, Jiang Sixi might not have abandoned him.

"Kill!" Luo Tian's aura was overwhelming. His nine-color halos shimmered, combining with the spatial Dao's Sealing Heaven Step to instantly appear before Sun Shaohui. He launched a devastating punch.

Luo Tian's speed was extreme, even Sun Shaohui couldn't react in time. He was struck by Luo Tian's punch, his mind shaken.

Luo Tian's previous attacks might have been dismissive to Sun Shaohui, but now his strength could truly harm him.

"Pu..." In the annihilating punch, Sun Shaohui's face paled slightly. He spat out blood and was sent flying, crashing into the barrier.

Before Sun Shaohui could recover, Luo Tian's second punch came roaring in, accompanied by a whistling sound. It struck Sun Shaohui's head.

Luo Tian moved like a phantom, punching repeatedly without giving Sun Shaohui even a moment to breathe.

"Ugh..." Feeling Sun Shaohui's weakness, Luo Tian let out a long sigh, his face filled with endless gloom.

"Chaos Seal!" Three great seals instantly formed and merged together, grey chaos energy emerging from Luo Tian's hands before rushing into the seals.

"Buzz..." A world-destroying aura radiated from the seal, causing the Blue Dragon Sect disciples to tremble slightly and their gazes flicker.

"Sky-Overwhelming!" Sensing the terrifying chaos seal, Sun Shaohui finally controlled himself and unleashed his strongest technique. His eyes also showed infinite madness.

Sun Shaohui's hands formed a seal, and his star-origin energy surged out into the void.

"Boom..." A deep sound echoed in the Blue Dragon Arena's sky, as if a massive star broke through space and appeared above the arena.

As meteors descended, the entire sky was obscured by this massive meteor. A heavy pressure rose in people's hearts.

"Go!" Feeling the pressure from the meteor, Luo Tian waved his hand. The massive chaos seal rushed toward the descending meteor.

"Boom..." The grey chaos seal collided with the massive meteor, unleashing a violent wave that instantly swept over Luo Tian and Sun Shaohui.

The entire Blue Dragon Arena shattered due to the collision of these two techniques, turning into a storm of dust that obscured people's vision.

"Crack..." The barriers surrounding the Blue Dragon Arena emitted a clear sound, with cracks spreading across them, leaving people stunned.

"Powerful... truly powerful!" One disciple stared at the scene where even the Grand Master's array was almost shattered. His gaze was dazed as he whispered.

After thirty seconds, the dust slowly settled under people's expectant gazes. But in an instant, a fierce explosion echoed again in their ears, startling the Blue Dragon Sect disciples.

"This hasn't decided the outcome yet!" Hearing the intense collision sounds within the barrier, the Blue Dragon Sect disciples' blood was ignited.

The dust cleared. Luo Tian and Sun Shaohui were both battered, but they continued clashing. In a short time, they had exchanged several blows.

"Damn it!" Sun Shaohui's face turned completely grim. He hadn't expected to burn his original source and still couldn't subdue this annoying kid, and now he was even at a disadvantage.

Luo Tian's eyes were closed. Though battered, he was in the upper hand, pressing Sun Shaohui to his limit.

"Who is this kid? How could he reach the realm of unity with heaven and self? I know all the White Tiger Sect's prodigies. Why have I never seen this person!" Sun Shaohui's face twisted with rage, his wounds increasing.

"Indeed, he has subdued Sun Shaohui!" Jiang Sixi and Sima Qiong's eyes flashed with intense light, gazing at Luo Tian in the realm of unity with heaven and self.

"Boom... boom... boom..." The sound of punches hitting flesh echoed on Sun Shaohui's body. With each punch, Sun Shaohui weakened slightly.

"One... two..." As time passed, under people's stunned gazes, Luo Tian delivered over a hundred punches. Finally, he subdued Sun Shaohui completely, leaving him as lifeless as a pile of mud on the ground. Three grey soul fragments flew from Sun Shaohui's lifeless body.

At the moment Sun Shaohui's soul fragments emerged, Luo Tian suddenly opened his eyes. His gaze flashed with an endless cold killing intent.

Luo Tian's current state wasn't good either. To describe it as five labors and seven injuries was no exaggeration. A strong sense of weakness invaded Luo Tian's nerves.

"Bamboo Crystal Luminous Flame!" Suppressing the urge to collapse, Luo Tian slapped his hand. A green flame shot into the sky, rushing toward Sun Shaohui's three soul fragments.

"Come back!" Sun Shaohui's three grey soul fragments showed boundless fear in their eyes. The feeling of approaching death made Sun Shaohui scream.

"Brother, use the Binding Soul Band!" Seeing his brother about to be killed by Luo Tian, Sun Shaowen shouted urgently.

"Right! Binding Soul Band!" Sun Shaohui's three grey soul fragments, as if struck by lightning, no longer fled. They rapidly transformed.

"Kid, in the end, you're the one who dies!" Sun Shaohui's grey face showed a sinister expression as he gazed at Luo Tian, his killing intent boundless.

How many years had it been since Sun Shaohui felt so helpless? Even when facing Jiang Sixi, he hadn't felt this desperate.

"Buzz..." A strange fluctuation echoed from Sun Shaohui's grey soul fragments, causing the Blue Dragon Sect disciples to slightly frown. Their gazes also carried a sense of pity.

At this moment, people had completely regarded Luo Tian as a prodigy. Even compared to Jiang Sixi, he was no less outstanding. But in the end, he died by the Binding Soul Band, a pitiful fate.

"Damn it! I forgot about this!" Sima Qiong's face showed anger as he looked at Sun Shaohui.

"Despicable!" The Blue Dragon Sect's attendants showed anger. They had been in a good mood after Luo Tian defeated Sun Shaohui, but they hadn't expected Sun Shaohui to be so despicable, using the Binding Soul Band.

"Roar..." But it was too late. Luo Tian had his head in pain, crouching down with a low growl. He couldn't even control the Bamboo Crystal Luminous Flame, which hovered in midair.

"Come here! Kneel down!" Sun Shaohui's three soul fragments, with a triumphant expression, converged into one. They floated in the sky like a tangible entity.

"Crack..." Luo Tian gritted his teeth, his head's Binding Soul Band emitting a brilliant light. Both soul and body endured unbearable pain under this immense pressure. His hands tightly clenched into fists, his fingers turning white.

"Don't resist. Come kneel down and bow to me. Then I'll let you die with less pain!" Sun Shaohui's face showed triumph as he spoke to Luo Tian.

Some people said the book had increased in price. Here, I'll explain: there's no increase in price. Each chapter now has 3000 words instead of the previous 2000, so there's no price increase!

Chapter 755: The Arrival of the White Tiger Sect

Chapter 755: The Arrival of the White Tiger Sect

On the Blue Dragon Continent, at the Blue Dragon Arena, it could no longer be called an arena. The original few-zhang-high platform had completely turned to dust, and the entire ground had sunk downward.

Luo Tian knelt on the ground with his head in his hands, in unbearable pain. His face was pale like a sheet of paper, even his gaze had become hazy.

Above the sky, the three soul fragments forming Sun Shaohui's figure showed a triumphant expression. He gazed at Luo Tian, waiting for him to kneel before him.

He couldn't resist. It seemed some force in the void was guiding Luo Tian, making his body instinctively obey Sun Shaohui's words.

Mechanically standing up, Luo Tian's eyes were hazy. He took a painful step forward toward Sun Shaohui.

"Damn Binding Soul Band!" Luo Tian's heart roared in anger, but the intense pain made him almost lose his mind. If it weren't for enduring so much hardship before, he might have already fainted.

"One... two..." Under people's watchful eyes, Luo Tian finally struggled to reach Sun Shaohui. His legs slightly bent as he used the last bit of his willpower to resist the soul's command.

"Ugh..." Jiang Sixi sighed, his gaze filled with pity as he looked at Luo Tian. He felt a sense of regret for not recognizing Luo Tian's value.

"Servant, servant. Even if you're powerful, your fate is still that of a servant!" Sun Shaohui's face showed triumph. His voice echoed like thunder across the Blue Dragon Arena.

"Despicable!" The Blue Dragon Sect's attendants showed sorrowful expressions. Today, everything Luo Tian endured might come to them tomorrow.

Some attendants even looked eager to act and save Luo Tian, but they ultimately remained in place. They knew their strength was like an ant within the Blue Dragon Sect. Any single thought from those disciples would turn them into the same fate as Luo Tian.

Anger surged within the attendants' hearts. They thought of their own fates. Half of the Blue Dragon Sect's attendants had been forcibly brought in, becoming servants before they were free. They had once been wandering cultivators or even masters of small sects, but now they were like slaves.

"Kneel down. After you kneel, I'll let you die quickly!" Sun Shaohui spoke softly, even standing triumphantly before Luo Tian.

"What are you?" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with red as he roared, gripping the Binding Soul Band tightly to ease his pain.

"Haha. It seems you truly don't know the power of the Binding Soul Band!" Sun Shaohui extended his grey hand and slightly grabbed.

Golden light flared. The Binding Soul Band on Luo Tian's head emitted more pressure, tightly squeezing his head to death.

"Ah..." Luo Tian let out a long scream. His long hair flew, his pain unbearable. His crimson eyes glared coldly at Sun Shaohui.

"Die first, you die!" Luo Tian's eyes showed infinite madness. It seemed he used his last strength to grasp the Binding Soul Band, freeing one hand to strike fiercely.

"Buzz..." A green flame shot into the sky, forming a long green dragon. It instantly appeared before Sun Shaohui, its terrifying temperature sweeping over his soul.

Sun Shaohui had been triumphant. His grey face still bore a triumphant expression, believing Luo Tian was bound by the Binding Soul Band and had no ability to resist. After all, the Binding Soul Band was a treasure of the Blue Dragon Sect, and no servant had ever endured its pain.

But in an instant, Sun Shaohui felt the terrifying temperature that could burn through space. It swept over his soul.

"Ah..." He only let out a scream before his soul was devoured by the Bamboo Crystal Luminous Flame, turning into a pile of ash floating in the world.

Luo Tian's sudden move shocked everyone. No one expected his willpower to be so astonishing, allowing him to endure the Binding Soul Band's pain and use a bit of his mind to control the Bamboo Crystal Luminous Flame, killing Sun Shaohui.

"Boom..." The Blue Dragon Sect disciples exploded with shock. Their faces showed amazement as they looked at Luo Tian, who was now sitting on the ground, breathing heavily. They hadn't expected Luo Tian to actually kill Sun Shaohui.

"Senior Sun died?" The Blue Dragon Sect disciples murmured, finally accepting the outcome. That was the second-ranked genius of the Blue Dragon Sect, Sun Shaohui, killed by a servant named Luo Tian.

"Good!" The Blue Dragon Sect's attendants showed excitement. Today, what Luo Tian did truly made the attendants proud.

"Brother died!" Sun Shaowen murmured, his eyes filled with endless sorrow. Thinking of his greatest support and the brother who loved him most, he now looked at Luo Tian with hatred in his eyes.

"You also come and join your brother!" Sun Shaowen, blinded by hatred, didn't think twice. His hands flashed with blue light as he sent out a string of runes toward Luo Tian.

"Die!" Sima Qiong's eyes were cold. As the third-ranked prodigy, he recognized the runes Sun Shaowen had launched—activation runes for the Binding Soul Band to kill servants.

At this point, the battle between Luo Tian and Sun Shaohui had ended. No one else could interfere. Moreover, Sima Qiong was in a good mood. The wealth of the entire sect's disciples had flowed into his pocket due to Luo Tian's victory.

Seeing Sun Shaowen about to kill Luo Tian, Sima Qiong felt indebted to Luo Tian. His eyes flashed with killing intent as he unleashed his second-origin supreme power fully.

The sun rose, and Sima Qiong transformed into a beam of sunlight. He instantly arrived, piercing Sun Shaowen's body and soul with golden light.

Sun Shaowen, in the middle of casting runes, was annihilated by this beam of light. He followed in Sun Shaohui's footsteps.

Without the Binding Soul Band's pain, Luo Tian's face regained a bit of color. His expression turned fierce: "This Binding Soul Band is a curse. I need to find a way to get rid of it soon, otherwise, my entire life will be controlled by the Blue Dragon Sect!"

Luo Tian made a decision in his heart, but he had no clue. Even the Grand Master of the sect had no solution for this Binding Soul Band.

Luo Tian slowly stood up, gazing at Jiang Sixi. He didn't speak further but silently walked behind her. After all, he was still Jiang Sixi's servant.

But his gaze was icy as he stood behind her. He continued to recover from the damage caused by the battle.

The surrounding strong cultivators of Jiang Sixi gradually stepped aside. At this point, people had completely defined Luo Tian as the first attendant of Jiang Sixi. Even Li Naiyang said nothing, slightly stepping aside to show respect for Luo Tian.

"Brother, this is the energy stones you won earlier. Take them!" Sima Qiong smiled as he approached Luo Tian, gently patting his shoulder. He tossed storage bags one by one before him.

The biggest winner of this Blue Dragon Arena life-and-death match was undoubtedly Luo Tian. The second biggest winner wasn't Jiang Sixi but Sima Qiong, who had collected all the sect disciples' energy stones into his pocket. He had made a fortune, and with Sun Shaohui's death, Sima Qiong's status would also rise significantly.

"Thank you for helping me earlier!" Luo Tian smiled, his gaze showing gratitude. If it weren't for Sima Qiong, he might have been killed by Sun Shaowen.

If that were the case, Luo Tian would be the most pitiful supreme-level cultivator to have died.

"No problem. It was a small favor!" Sima Qiong didn't mind Luo Tian calling him "Sima Brother." He smiled indifferently. As the third-ranked prodigy, he wasn't foolish. He knew Luo Tian's future was limitless.

As for the fact that Luo Tian used the White Tiger Transformation, Sima Qiong and other Blue Dragon Sect disciples thought about it for a while before understanding.

What was the Blue Dragon Sect? The Grand Master, an eight-origin heaven supreme. His cultivation was unparalleled. People didn't believe Luo Tian's use of the White Tiger Transformation and his massive commotion would be unknown to the Grand Master. Since the Grand Master hadn't said anything, what did they have to fear?

"Senior Sister Jiang, let me discuss something. Let you take Luo Tian too!" Sima Qiong eyed Luo Tian, addressing Jiang Sixi.

"Get out..." Jiang Sixi's gaze was cold. She had already regretted abandoning Luo Tian before. Now, Sima Qiong wanted to eye Luo Tian, making Jiang Sixi's gaze turn dark.

"I'll speak honestly. From now on, you are my strongest attendant, second only to me!" Jiang Sixi smiled at Luo Tian.

"Ah..." The Blue Dragon Sect disciples' faces showed admiration, then shock. Jiang Sixi, who was usually cold, had smiled at Luo Tian.

"Truly beautiful! I envy Luo Tian!" The Blue Dragon Sect disciples showed admiration, gazing at Luo Tian. No one now dared to regard Luo Tian as a mere attendant. Even they had begun to see him as a genius like Sima Qiong.

"No need!" Luo Tian smiled, taking out a jade slip from his storage ring and tossing it into the sky.

The Grand Master of the Blue Dragon Sect, seated in the back mountains, opened his eyes instantly. He reached out with his hand, and the jade slip appeared in his palm through space.

"Roar..." A low roar echoed in people's ears. A massive tiger's roar resounded in the sky above the vast Blue Dragon Mountain, sending a terrifying and fierce aura through people's hearts. A heavy pressure settled on their bodies.

"Sha Cangmang! Come out! Your Blue Dragon Sect disciples killed my White Tiger Sect disciple. Today, are you going to give me an explanation!" A霸道 voice echoed from the void, making Luo Tian's gaze slightly tense.

Chapter 756: Full of Doubts

Chapter 756: Full of Doubts!

On the Blue Dragon Continent, above the Blue Dragon Sect, tigers roared. The void was torn apart as several figures pierced through the sky and appeared above the Blue Dragon Sect.

"Sha Cangmang! Come out!" A senior's aura was extremely powerful. His voice echoed, shaking the heavens and earth like a thunderous roar.

The Blue Dragon Sect disciples were stunned. Each of his words sounded like a lightning bolt in their ears, even Jiang Sixi was momentarily stunned. Her face showed a hint of fear.

"White Tiger Sect's Grand Master! Why has he come to my Blue Dragon Sect?"

"Not only has the White Tiger Sect's Grand Master arrived, but also the four great supreme beings and eight earth supreme beings of the White Tiger Sect!" The Blue Dragon Sect disciples showed confusion, gazing at the several figures with formidable auras in the sky.

"Roar..." A blue dragon's image appeared in the sky, making the Blue Dragon Sect disciples show respect.

"Respect the Grand Master!" The Blue Dragon Sect disciples showed reverence, gazing at the blue-cloaked elder.

"Jin Yongsi! Why have you come to my Blue Dragon Sect with such a display?" The Grand Master of the Blue Dragon Sect, Sha Cangmang, spoke in his deep voice. His words echoed like thunder into the ears of the White Tiger Sect's strong cultivators.

The voice was grand, causing even the other eight-source supreme beings of the White Tiger Sect, including Jin Yongsi, to tremble slightly. Two seven-source supreme beings also shook.

Blue light flashed as several figures appeared in the vast Blue Dragon Mountain, letting out a low roar. They appeared before people's eyes. Their auras were no weaker than the White Tiger Sect's strong cultivators.

"What are you doing? Although our four continents have some friction, we haven't reached the point of killing each other's disciples. Your Blue Dragon Sect's servant killed my White Tiger Sect disciple. Tell me, why have you come? If you don't give me an explanation today, this won't end!" Jin Yongsi spoke coldly, gazing at Luo Tian.

An eight-source supreme being. At the moment Jin Yongsi appeared in the sky, he had already scanned the portrait taken by Long Haoyue.

After being scanned by Jin Yongsi, Luo Tian's mind trembled. The immense pressure again enveloped his body, making his legs slightly bend and cracks appear under his feet.

"Hmph?" Jin Yongsi looked at Luo Tian carefully, his eyes flashing with intense light. His gaze carried a hint of joy.

"Nine-Attribute Body Type?" Jin Yongsi was shocked, but his aura gradually receded.

Seeing Jin Yongsi had seen Luo Tian, the Grand Master of the Blue Dragon Sect, Sha Cangmang, furrowed his brows. He waved his hand, and a storage ring flew toward Jin Yongsi's hands.

"This contains enough resources to cultivate ten more disciples. This kid is now my disciple. If you harm him, I will surely fight with your White Tiger Sect!" Sha Cangmang's old voice carried an infinite霸道.

"Haha! This kid is your disciple? He even wears the Binding Soul Band. Kid, I'll give you a chance. Join my sect, and this Blue Dragon Sect won't stop you!" Jin Yongsi's face showed a smile. His previous fierce aura had disappeared, and he looked like a kind old man.

"What's going on?" The Blue Dragon Sect disciples were stunned, their faces showing disbelief as they gazed at Luo Tian.

"Two Grand Masters of the Four Sacred Star Domains are vying for Luo Tian as a disciple! I didn't hear wrong, did I!" The Blue Dragon Sect disciples stood on the ground, gazing at Luo Tian with changing expressions.

"It's not right. These two definitely aren't just trying to take me as a disciple!" Luo Tian felt confused, gazing at the two Grand Masters. But he kept his expression calm.

"Kid, how will you choose? Don't worry. If you truly choose my White Tiger Sect, then this Sha Cangmang won't stop you!" Seeing Luo Tian glance at the two Grand Masters, Jin Yongsi continued to persuade him, his eyes showing intense desire.

"Kid, if you stay in my Blue Dragon Sect, all the resources of the entire Blue Dragon Sect will be yours. Whatever you want, you can get it, including Jiang Sixi. If you desire her, I'll arrange for the two of you to get married tonight!" Sha Cangmang spoke, revealing his stakes. His eyes flashed with light.

"What? What is this Luo Tian's background that he has attracted such a huge offer from the Grand Master to stay in the Blue Dragon Sect!" The Blue Dragon Sect disciples were completely stunned.

Even Jiang Sixi was stunned, her face showing anger. This clearly meant she had been abandoned and Luo Tian was being kept.

Jiang Sixi's face turned extremely pale, her complexion turning purple. She had previously abandoned Luo Tian to fight with Kong Mingzi. Now it was her turn to be abandoned by the Grand Master, a sense of retribution rising in her heart.

"I'll stay in the Blue Dragon Sect. What about Senior Sister Jiang?" Luo Tian's face showed a hint of amusement as he gazed at the perfect Jiang Sixi.

Being looked at by Luo Tian's gaze, Jiang Sixi felt uncomfortable. Her eyes carried a cold expression.

"Put the Binding Soul Band on her and make her my servant!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a smile. Facing two eight-source supreme beings, he spoke loudly.
