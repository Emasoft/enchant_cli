"Swallow it! Make this old bastard cry—who let him cheat me!" Luo Tian shouted directly at the Supplementing Heaven Stone.

"Five immortal crystals!" At this moment, the old man had already begun negotiating with the customer, still insisting on five immortal crystals.

"That's too expensive. Eight thousand Immortal Qi Stones!" The man clearly was far more stingy than Luo Tian.

"Deal!" The old man still agreed instantly, leaving the customer astonished. However, Luo Tian could sense the customer's joy.

"This is eight thousand Immortal Qi Stones—I'm taking it!" The man waved his hand, sending a storage pouch to the old man's front. He immediately reached for the Moon and Sun Grass.

"Crack..." Before the man could grasp it, a withered hand slapped onto his hand.

"Guest, let me handle this better!" The vendor moved swiftly, directly plucking the Moon and Sun Grass down and handing it to the man's front.

"You..." The man, seeing this, clearly understood the vendor was setting a trap for him.

"You dare to provoke me? Take this broken stone as well!" The customer, unlike Luo Tian, was not easy to deceive. His temper flared.

A gust of wind radiated from the man, a half-step Immortal King's aura pressing down. The surrounding people's eyes showed shock.

"A half-step Immortal King!" People gasped. In this region, a half-step Immortal King was rare; most half-step Immortal Kings were traded in the Wolf's Head area.

"One hand pays, one hand exchanges. Do you think you can steal it?" However, the vendor was no pushover. His aura suddenly erupted, accompanied by an invisible fluctuation that enveloped the surroundings—Domain Power.

"Immortal King!" The customer gasped, stepping back and bowing respectfully to the vendor.

"Senior, it was my recklessness. Here is an immortal crystal—please don't be angry!" The man quickly addressed the vendor.

"Ah, you seem sincere. Go ahead," the vendor said with satisfaction.

"Thank you, senior!" The man's heart ached. He hadn't expected to meet an Immortal King here. Usually, Immortal Kings were in the Wolf's Head area—how could he have anticipated an Immortal King hiding in plain sight?

"Crack..." Just as the man was about to take a step away, a crisp crack echoed beneath their feet, causing both to startle.

"What's going on?" The vendor looked at the place where the sound came from and gasped. That stone he had relied on to make money had shattered, turning into a pile of powder.

"Give it back!" The vendor was furious. His hand grabbed the half-step Immortal King who was about to leave, pulling him forward. Two cold glows flashed from beneath the black veil.

Chapter 2420: A Precious Item

The vendor held the half-step Immortal King in his hand. Both trembled, their breaths heavy—though one was angry and the other terrified.

"Senior... it's not my fault!" The half-step Immortal King, caught in the vendor's grip, urinated and defecated uncontrollably. His voice trembled as he spoke. He knew people who came to the black market were no pushovers; his life might end here.

"It's not you? Who else could it be? Since the black market started, only two people have seen my Moon and Sun Grass!"

"Hand it over quickly, or today is your last day!" The vendor shouted, his anger evident.

"I swear on blood I didn't do it!" The half-step Immortal King cried out, struggling with difficulty, his eyes red.

"Also you!" The vendor's gaze turned to Luo Tian's direction, his eyes flashing with ferocity. Only two people had seen his stone, so Luo Tian was suspicious.

Domain Power enveloped Luo Tian. The overwhelming pressure overturned Luo Tian's stall.

"Did you dare to bully me?" Luo Tian's cold voice echoed. His roar resonated around him, and Domain Power spread out. Gray spiritual souls drifted within the domain, countless faces staring at the old man with roars.

"Another Immortal King!" People were shocked, watching Luo Tian's domain clash with the vendor's.

"What if he is an Immortal King? I've slain them before!" The vendor, seeing Luo Tian's domain, was momentarily stunned but still spoke boldly. Domain Power spread toward Luo Tian.

Crackling sounds echoed as the two domains collided, shattering. However, it was the old man's domain that cracked. Luo Tian's domain was self-contained and unapproved by Heaven, far stronger than a typical Immortal King's.

"Whirr..." A black long sword appeared in the vendor's hand. The sword swept, its blade rising to slash at Luo Tian.

"Roar..." A dragon's roar echoed as the Long Yuan Sword flew from its crimson sheath, like a roaring dragon. It emitted a dark aura and clashed with the blade.

"Crack..." Thunder flashed, and the vendor was repelled. His black veil revealed an expression of disbelief as he looked at his sword.

The blade's edge had a chipped section. This shocked the old man; his sword was an upper-grade immortal artifact, yet it had suffered such damage from one strike. This demonstrated the Long Yuan Sword's might.

"Friend, if it truly was you, I hope you'll compensate me at the price. Let this be a transaction, and I'll consider us friends!"

"This Moon and Sun Stone is an extraordinary treasure. I can't let it be damaged without a reckoning!" The vendor spoke, and everyone could sense his tone had softened from before.

The vendor had guessed it was likely Luo Tian who tampered with it. However, the brief clash showed Luo Tian's strength, and he didn't want to fight.

"Ah, so it was the Moon and Sun Stone! That's why this vendor fought so desperately!" People gasped, realizing the stone's value.

"I'll give you a reckoning!" Luo Tian took a step forward, and the Long Yuan Sword appeared in his hand. It instantly materialized before the vendor, its broad blade descending again.

"You!" The vendor's face changed. He immediately tossed the half-step Immortal King he was holding and raised his sword to meet it.

The collision sound returned. The swords clashed, and the vendor retreated again, blood flowing from his black veil.

"What reckoning do you want? This is my reckoning!" Luo Tian stood still, his aura overwhelming. He took another step forward and slashed again.

"Crack..." This time the vendor's sword was riddled with cracks. It seemed as if a slight touch would shatter it. The vendor's tiger's mouth even split, spreading along his entire arm.

"So strong... terrifying!"

"Three strikes wounded an Immortal King!" People who had stepped back gasped, looking at Luo Tian with reverence.

"You've slain Immortal Kings? I've slain more than you!" As people marveled, Luo Tian's fourth strike fell. The Long Yuan Sword expanded and pressed down.

The vendor's face changed. His hands glowed black, meeting the overwhelming sword aura. "Boom..."

...

The explosion spread, dust swept away, and two blood mists erupted from the dust. The vendor had his arms severed and lay there. His black veil was gone, revealing an old man's face.

"Bone-Eating Elder!" Recognizing the old man's appearance, people gasped and identified him.

A rogue cultivator, Bone-Eating Elder. He was ruthless, having slain nine sect disciples. He had been hunted by an Immortal King of the Heaven-Soul Sect but ultimately slain that sect's strength, earning his fame.

"You!"

"Do you still want a reckoning?" Luo Tian didn't continue attacking but held the Long Yuan Sword, its cold glint flashing from the demon qi. It imprinted itself in the vendor's eyes, causing him to show fear.

"Friend, this was a misunderstanding!" The Bone-Eating Elder spoke loudly, his voice weak. He stood up and walked toward the Wolf's Head Mountain, knowing his identity was exposed. His current situation was dangerous; if his enemies saw him, he would be in trouble. He just wanted to find a place to heal.

"My sword's withdrawal is costly. Each time I withdraw it, there's损耗!" Luo Tian coldly spoke, not finishing him off. After all, the opponent was an Immortal King; if he truly fought to the end, his identity would be exposed.

However, Luo Tian's words made the Bone-Eating Elder stop.

"Friend, this is my compensation. I hope you'll accept it. No fight, no friendship!" The Bone-Eating Elder spoke, knowing Luo Tian wanted compensation. He smiled bitterly and handed another storage pouch to Luo Tian.

"Another ten... this old man is really rich!" Luo Tian muttered, his breathing quickened as he looked at the Bone-Eating Elder.

"Go!" Luo Tian saw it was enough and spoke to the Bone-Eating Elder. The elder, relieved, hurriedly fled, his body flashing and disappearing into the night.

But as the Bone-Eating Elder left, several figures followed him. Obviously, they wanted to take advantage of his injury and see if they could gain something.

"Truly fearless people!" Luo Tian sighed inwardly, watching them leave.

"How?" Luo Tian stood there and communicated with the Supplementing Heaven Stone, quite expectant.

"It's not enough... burp..." The Supplementing Heaven Stone responded. However, Luo Tian heard a belch sound. Clearly, it had gained considerable benefits but still craved more.

"This place I like!" Luo Tian muttered to himself. If forced, he could easily seize it.

Under the people's reverent gazes, the Long Yuan Sword returned to its sheath. Luo Tian stepped forward toward the Wolf's Head Mountain, where precious items gathered.

After an hour of walking, Luo Tian bought more things. All were placed into the Supplementing Heaven Stone's mouth, leaving only what he needed.

The Wolf's Head Mountain had only a few dozen stalls. People gradually set up their stands, but the crowd was massive—twenty to thirty people. The weakest were at the peak of True Immortal, with several half-step Immortal Kings among them.

"Treasures!" Luo Tian's face showed admiration. He glanced at the stalls, sighing inwardly. The items here were basically what True Immortal peak and above needed.

"All mine!" The Supplementing Heaven Stone spoke loudly, but Luo Tian restrained it, fearing it would cause trouble.

"A seed of an immortal herb!" Luo Tian's gaze fell on a stall. He discovered a seed of an immortal herb, extremely precious.

The jade-like seed lay there, emitting green light. Its dense vitality filled the air, drawing a crowd with greedy eyes.

"Though precious, it has a crack. It was deliberately damaged, taking most of its vitality!" Luo Tian shook his head. Without special methods, this seed would not grow.

Luo Tian had a unique advantage over immortal herbs—his "Wan Wu Hua Sheng Jing" (Ten Thousand Life Transformation Scripture). Perhaps he could cultivate an immortal herb in his lifetime.

"How much for this seed?" Luo Tian sighed as someone asked the price. Even damaged, it was still rare.

"Just exchange for a Ghost Valley Token!" The stall owner spoke hoarsely, causing people to shake their heads.

"Just bring a Ghost Valley Token and this entire stall's items are yours!" The stall owner added, looking at the crowd.

Hearing "Ghost Valley Token," people became more disappointed. This black market had many treasures compared to previous ones, with many bringing precious items to exchange for Ghost Valley Tokens.

The Ghost Valley Master was a godlike figure in the immortal world. Whoever obtained a Ghost Valley Token became a disciple of the Ghost Valley, an identity that was very prestigious. After all, the Ghost Valley Master's strength had surpassed people's imagination.

"Never mind," Luo Tian shook his head. He had two Ghost Valley Tokens, but exchanging for the stall owner's items didn't seem worth it.

Luo Tian continued to walk through several stalls, finding most stall owners were after Ghost Valley Tokens.

"Whirr..." As Luo Tian was disappointed, a radiant light emitted from a stall, drawing people's attention. He walked over.

The divine laws flowed, directing most people's gazes to that stall. The stall owner had just arrived and set up his stand. What attracted people most was a jade-colored token before the old man.

The stall had only this one token. On the jade token, three big characters were carved—Ghost Valley Token!

"Ghost Valley Token!" People gasped. Someone's breath quickened, looking at the jade token—clearly not ordinary.

"This is the legendary Ghost Valley Token? A great immortal's legacy?" People whispered among themselves.

"Who wants to exchange for it?" Someone immediately asked, their eyes showing eagerness.

"Is this fake?" Luo Tian heard the people's gasps and saw those asking. He thought to himself.

Luo Tian wasn't like others; he had two Ghost Valley Tokens and knew these were fake.

"This person wants to deceive people!" Luo Tian understood the stall owner's intention. He sighed inwardly, thinking this black market was indeed mixed with good and bad people—first using the Moon and Sun Stone to deceive, then fake Ghost Valley Tokens.

"Whoever offers the highest price, I'll exchange with them!" The stall owner spoke directly.

"Ten large immortal crystals!" Someone said, their breath quickened. However, it immediately caused people to sneer. Immortal crystals were precious, but they couldn't compare to the Ghost Valley Token.

"I have this immortal herb seed and these!" The previous stall owner who had the immortal herb seed also spoke, collecting his items.

This stall owner's words immediately made most people stop bidding. After all, he had not only the immortal herb seed but also two upper-grade immortal artifacts and a rare eighth-tier elixir.

"I offer one ninth-tier immortal elixir!" However, someone still bid. At first, they were confused, but seeing everyone vying for it, one couldn't resist.

"Ninth-tier immortal elixir!" People's faces showed disbelief, looking at the stall owner who spoke.

"It's not a real ninth-tier immortal elixir. It's one that hasn't experienced the Heavenly Tempest!" That stall owner spoke, waving his hand to produce the elixir.

"Boom..." The world thundered. Dark clouds hovered above the dark sky, emitting an incredible aura that made True Immortal peak强者 shudder.

The bidder immediately sealed the elixir, looking at the person selling the fake Ghost Valley Token.

"This technique!" Luo Tian's eyes showed surprise. He was a seventh-tier immortal elixir master, not very familiar with ninth-tier elixirs. He hadn't expected a ninth-tier immortal elixir to be so magical, able to do this.

"Only one ninth-tier immortal elixir master exists in the world—Master Jiang Yuanxiong of Supplementing Heaven Mountain! However, it's said his success rate in refining ninth-tier immortal elixirs is very low!"

"Moreover, ninth-tier immortal elixirs require many rare herbs and even a single immortal herb!" People whispered among themselves, their eyes greedy.

Even Luo Tian felt envious. The Supplementing Heaven Stone also clamored to snatch it.

"However, to obtain this elixir, one must take it quickly. The body must endure the Heavenly Tempest!" Luo Tian muttered to himself. For him, it wasn't a problem; after all, he was used to being struck by lightning.

"You two's items combined, I might consider it!" The stall owner with the fake Ghost Valley Token spoke. Obviously, a ninth-tier elixir that wasn't completed couldn't fully entice him.

"Too greedy!" People whispered, but no one rushed in. After all, the person dared to put it out; they must have confidence in their strength.

Hearing the stall owner's words, the two bidders' faces slightly changed. They exchanged glances; if they obtained each other's items, they could exchange.

"Two of you can combine to exchange and then both study it!" Someone in the crowd spoke.

"This is a trick. They even teamed up to deceive us!" Luo Tian surveyed the crowd, his eyes showing a hint of amusement.

Hearing that person's words, the two bidders' aura slightly diminished. However, they ultimately shook their heads. Studying together would let the other see their faces; they didn't trust each other.

The situation stalled. Finally, the stall owner with the fake Ghost Valley Token became impatient because more people were coming, making him anxious.

"Nine-tier immortal elixir person, let's exchange!" He directly spoke. The one holding the ninth-tier immortal elixir was overjoyed.

"Good." He didn't even think and handed the ninth-tier immortal elixir's vial to the stall owner.

They exchanged, both satisfied. The person with the fake Ghost Valley Token took the ninth-tier immortal elixir and flew toward the Wolf's Head Mountain.

"Alas..." People sighed, finally directing their gaze to the one who obtained the fake Ghost Valley Token. Some followed the strong person who had taken the ninth-tier immortal elixir.

"I am a disciple of the Ghost Valley!" The excited voice echoed. The person who had obtained the Ghost Valley Token radiated a powerful aura, intimidating others. He stored the token and wanted to leave.

"Roar..." Just as he was about to leave, a thunderous roar echoed from afar.

"What is this Ghost Valley Token? What is mine?" Just as people marveled and some had already packed up, preparing to chase the one who obtained the fake Ghost Valley Token, a voice of disdain and mockery echoed from behind.

A robust figure walked down the mountain, approaching people. He held a black token in his hand.

"This is the real Ghost Valley Token!" A cold voice echoed, drawing people's gazes to the token in his hand.

The black token was surrounded by ghostly mist, as if suppressing many ghosts. It gave people a cold feeling.

Luo Tian's eyes slightly narrowed, gazing at the black token. He knew this was indeed a real Ghost Valley Token.

"This..." Everyone was confused, surprised by the sudden appearance of another Ghost Valley Token.

"What about mine?" The previous stall owner who had exchanged for the fake token suddenly panicked, raising his hand to show the token. This move didn't go well; the three characters "Ghost Valley Token" on it immediately lost their divine light, gradually fading until it became an ordinary jade stone in his hand.

"Damn!" His face changed. He crushed the jade stone and flew away into the night.

"There's something wrong!" The Supplementing Heaven Stone's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, making him slightly startled.

"This person with the real token and the previous fake token seller are one and the same!" The Supplementing Heaven Stone spoke, making Luo Tian's face puzzled.

"Brilliant!" Luo Tian thought quickly and understood.

On the Wolf's Head Mountain, there were four Immortal Kings, including Luo Tian himself—five in total. This was what Luo Tian had sensed before.

"This was a setup. The Ghost Valley Token was just a lure to draw people in. Those who came here were mostly drawn by the Ghost Valley Token, meaning someone with a Ghost Valley Token might be among them!" Luo Tian muttered to himself, his spirit tense because one Ghost Valley Token had already appeared. It was likely someone would act next.

"This trap was probably set by him!"

"What gives him confidence?"

"His two accomplices?" Luo Tian's gaze turned to the person holding the Ghost Valley Token.

"Friend, what do you need? Please speak freely!" A stall owner stood up, looking at the person's Ghost Valley Token.

"I want the Ghost Valley Token. Whoever can produce another one, I'll exchange!" The person with the token spoke.

Hearing his words, people fell silent. There were eight Ghost Valley Tokens in total, but whoever obtained one would treasure it and not easily show it.

"Nobody wants to exchange?"

"Then I'm leaving!" The person with the Ghost Valley Token smiled, storing the token and flying out toward the Wolf's Head Mountain. Some people's eyes glowed with greed, hiding their forms and following the strong person. Not few.

"Alas..." Luo Tian sighed longingly, knowing these people had been deceived. The person clearly wanted to shift the battlefield because whoever possessed a Ghost Valley Token would follow.

Two Immortal Kings, three half-step Immortal Kings, and even over a dozen True Immortal peaks flew up, chasing after him.

"I always have a feeling we'll get a bargain!" Luo Tian's face showed a hint of joy. If it came to hiding, the Supplementing Heaven Stone's presence could outmatch anyone.

Luo Tian leaped into the air. However, at the moment he flew up, the Supplementing Heaven Stone absorbed him, and in the chaos, no one noticed someone missing.

"Hey hey, Supplementing Heaven Stone, you've grown a lot!" Luo Tian stood on the red earth, gazing at the almost boundless land, his eyes showing admiration.

"Eating those things isn't free!" The Supplementing Heaven Stone spoke proudly, turning into dust and following the crowd behind.

The person with the Ghost Valley Token didn't fly fast. Soon, he flew out of the Wolf's Head Mountain range and headed north. Those following him were cautious, sensing danger but driven by greed for the Ghost Valley Token to follow.

After about half an hour of flying, the strong person landed on a large mountain. He smiled, looking around.

"Come out!" Disdainful voice echoed. Black mist dispersed, revealing an old man's face.

"Master Ghost Valley, Dong Boxing!" People gasped, and figures appeared around the old man.

"Did one miss?" Dong Boxing's eyebrows slightly furrowed, not noticing Luo Tian's presence.

"Dong Boxing, hand over the Ghost Valley Token!" The strong person who had the immortal herb seed spoke, his aura filled with killing intent.

Chapter 2421: Observing the Battle

On a towering mountain, several figures stood there. Their auras had already clashed. Each True Immortal peak and half-step Immortal King walked down the mountain. The war of an Immortal King was beyond their participation; they just hoped to snatch a bargain.

However, as people walked down the mountain, waves of fluctuation came from all directions, instantly enveloping the entire mountain.

"Boundless Heaven and Earth!" Dong Boxing shouted. Eight people appeared at eight positions on the mountain, each holding a golden command flag.

Golden barriers enveloped the entire mountain peak. A powerful pressure instantly fell on people's bodies.

"Want to leave? It won't be that simple!" Dong Boxing sneered, his body rising into the sky. Golden light erupted from the barrier, forming countless golden suns that fell toward people, pressing down.

"Such a strong aura!" People gasped. They had time to gasp once before several True Immortal peaks were crushed by the Taiji Diagram, turning into blood mist.

A old man walked out from outside the barrier. His body was thin, his eyes fierce. His aura was astonishingly powerful, clearly at the Immortal King level. Most noticeable was his arms.

Two arms—no flesh and bone, but two bony arms emitting Dao laws and divine light. People felt chilled.

"Bone-Eating Elder!" People gasped, surprised to meet the Bone-Eating Elder. Even Luo Tian was slightly stunned.

"It's not right—his appearance is the Bone-Eating Elder, but he's been possessed!" People saw the red light in the Bone-Eating Elder's eyes and realized he had lost his original consciousness.

"Posessed!" Luo Tian looked at the situation, realizing the Bone-Eating Elder was no longer his original aura. His body radiated violence, not possessed by a soul but by a ghost.

"Kill..." Next moment, the Bone-Eating Elder and Dong Boxing rushed toward two Immortal Kings. Meanwhile, those golden suns continuously fell, killing half-step Immortal Kings and True Immortal peaks. It was like a meteor shower with no place to hide.

The world trembled, and the clash of four Immortal Kings caused violent fluctuations. The chaos killed many True Immortal peaks.

In an instant, all True Immortal peaks were wiped out. Only two or three half-step Immortal Kings with better movement skills remained, desperately struggling.

"Let us out! We have no hostility!" Several half-step Immortal Kings cried, constantly speaking.

But the eight people surrounding the mountain showed no reaction. They remained expressionless, manipulating the array to continuously attack the remaining half-step Immortal Kings.

Four Immortal King powers clashed without being affected. The continuous clashing of thunder echoed.

Luo Tian watched the chaotic battle, his brows furrowed. Dong Boxing had brought these people here so boldly; he must have absolute confidence. Like the previous Bone-Eating Elder, he wasn't a pushover—everyone was controlled by ghosts. But now, Dong Boxing's side didn't have the advantage. The Bone-Eating Elder was possessed and just now defeated by Luo Tian, his combat power couldn't be used. He was almost passively beaten, with both bony arms sweeping and clashing against one Immortal King's long sword.

"Dong Boxing, is this all your ability?" The Immortal King of the initial stage spoke disdainfully. Obviously, he and another had briefly formed an alliance.

"Of course not!" Dong Boxing sneered. He watched the last two half-step Immortal Kings be crushed by the array's pressure, his body retreating. Two people retreated with thunderous sounds from Dong Boxing's body.

Ghostly qi spread, forming black seals covering Dong Boxing. At the same time, his aura rapidly increased, and his robust body expanded again.

"Roar..." Black ghostly qi seemed to roar with thousands of ghosts, constantly transforming.

"This..." Two Immortal Kings of the initial stage changed color. They looked at Dong Boxing's aura, which had grown to the middle stage of Immortal King.

"Run..." They didn't think twice, rushing toward the barrier's outside. An Immortal King of the middle stage was beyond their ability to confront.

"Damn, he had been suppressing his power all along to prevent us from escaping!" They roared. The barrier could trap half-step Immortal Kings, but it couldn't stop them.

"Such a meticulous calculation!" Luo Tian's eyes showed admiration. Everything was within Dong Boxing's plan. He had suppressed his power, intentionally appearing weak to prevent the two from escaping. Because those half-step Immortal Kings hadn't been completely eliminated, this was to ensure none were left behind.

"Now you want to run? It's too late!" Dong Boxing smiled coldly, with ghostly qi swirling around him.

Dong Boxing's hands formed seals. A series of ghostly seal marks instantly imprinted on the Bone-Eating Elder.

"Boom..." Next moment, the Bone-Eating Elder's body exploded. A black qi surged out from his body and merged into the barrier.

A thunderous explosion instantly turned the entire mountain into ruins. The Bone-Eating Elder's power after exploding rushed into the barrier.

This all happened in a flash. The two Immortal Kings had just reached the barrier's edge when it became strong.

"Boom..." Their bodies collided with the barrier, emitting a thunderous sound.

"Pu..." However, blood spewed from their mouths. Their bodies flew back. The barrier's surroundings began to tremble, like an earthquake.

"Maintaining a barrier with the full power of one Immortal King initial stage is enough to trap you two for half an hour!" Dong Boxing's aura was overwhelming. He struck with one palm.

An attack from an Immortal King middle stage could kill an initial-stage Immortal King. Once one reached the Immortal King level, each small step up meant a difference of ten thousand miles.

"Fight!" The two initial-stage Immortal Kings showed madness. People in the black market were all ruthless; they knew escape was impossible, so only a desperate fight offered a slim chance.

In an instant, both fought desperately. The longer they dragged on, the worse it was for them.

One person's hands continuously transformed, his blood energy rising. He spat out a mouthful of blood, forming a crimson dragon that roared toward Dong Boxing.

The blood dragon twisted through the void, seemingly draining the Immortal King's body and causing him to fall from the sky.

The other person held a green long sword. Ghostly figures flowed on its blade, and the sword's aura slashed his arm, creating tiny mouths that began to absorb the strong person's blood.

"It must be this one!"

"This technique is similar to sacrificing oneself to ghosts. Only in hell does it exist!"

"Those with Ghost Valley Tokens can cultivate faster than others!" Luo Tian watched the ghostly figures on the long sword, muttering. He felt this person had a high chance of possessing a Ghost Valley Token.

"Whirr..." As Luo Tian muttered, the long sword with ghostly figures was instantly thrown toward Dong Boxing.

Dong Boxing's face slightly changed. He hadn't underestimated them, though he didn't know their identities yet. However, he knew they weren't pushovers.

Especially with both of them using their full strength in one strike, it made Dong Boxing feel a strong threat.

"Ten Thousand Ghosts Devour the Moon!" Dong Boxing roared, his hands moving. Thunderous sounds erupted as ghostly qi surged, forming a grotesque ghost that enveloped Dong Boxing.

The ghost figure from the barrier also flew out, its fierce aura spreading in all directions. It roared toward the hand that Dong Boxing had just thrown.

Boom...

The thunderous sound was overwhelming. The entire barrier trembled violently, like the end of the world. If not for the barrier's protection, it would have turned several million miles into ruins.

The ghost figure disintegrated. The crimson dragon also collapsed, but a black long sword shattered the storm's winds. A black ghost stood within it.

Another thunderous sound echoed, and that black sword aura slashed the ghost figure.

"Must kill or severely injure him to succeed!" The two initial-stage Immortal Kings fell to the ground, watching the devastating sword aura. They prayed.

"Crack..." However, a crack sound followed, causing their hearts to sink instantly.

The ghost figure roared. The black sword shattered, turning into countless ghostly qi swirling within the barrier.

The thunderous sound spread. Dong Boxing spat blood, his face pale. However, the ghost figure was weakened but hadn't disintegrated.

"Good attack. Let me see who among you has the Ghost Valley Token!" Dong Boxing looked at the two fallen people, his eyes showing anticipation. The ghost figure dissipated but he struck again with a palm.

"Boom..." Two blood mists rose, directly killing the two and taking their storage rings into his possession.

"Not seriously injured!" Luo Tian's brows slightly furrowed. He looked at Dong Boxing and sat on the red earth, preparing for a full effort against him. He also needed to sneak attack; otherwise, it would be a bloodbath.

Black demon patterns flew from Luo Tian's hands and rapidly imprinted on his body. Luo Tian began preparing for the Heavenly Demon Dissolution, planning to launch a decisive strike when Dong Boxing was most careless.

Dong Boxing's eyes showed excitement. He crushed the two people's storage rings, and a pile of items scattered before him. Among them was the immortal herb seed from the previous stall owner.

"Very rich!" Dong Boxing didn't covet other items. His eyes scanned the disarrayed items, searching for the Ghost Valley Token.

Chapter 2423: The Ghost Valley Appears, the World Changes

Items scattered before Dong Boxing. His eyes flashed like lightning as he scanned them.

"I found it!" He laughed, grabbing a black token among the items—exactly the Ghost Valley Token.

"One strike!" Just as Dong Boxing was excited, a cold voice echoed behind him. It made him shiver.

"Who!" Dong Boxing shouted, turning around. However, he felt his entire body cold. A black sword aura instantly slashed down, a powerful pressure preventing him from moving.

"..."
