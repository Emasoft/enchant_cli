"Is that my older brother?" Shui Yunqian's eyes sparkled with excitement as she gazed upon the white-cloaked Shui Wuqing. When Shui Wuqing vanished, Shui Yunqian had just been born and held no deep memories of him.

"What is this?" The elder's brows furrowed slightly, his aura radiating authority and pressing upon the crowd.

"Clan War!" Bai Sha's face darkened as he faced the elder. Though he and Jingxiang would not fear the elder in a fight, their opponent was backed by Huanhai Tian Palace, the dominant force of Huantian Sea. Even when Bai Sha was weak, Huanhai Tian Palace had ruled unchallenged for ages, revealing its formidable foundation.

"Buzz..." Luotian, Fu Xingyue, and Shui Yunqian materialized, causing the crowd to gasp in shock.

"How did they vanish?" The onlookers bore expressions of disbelief. They had witnessed their mysterious disappearance, yet now they reappeared out of nowhere—beyond comprehension.

"Luotian..." Xiang Tianming spotted Luotian, his eyes widening in surprise. He had not expected to find him here.

"Uncle Xiang, please take my side! These people attacked me without reason! Look at the injuries I've sustained—nearly killed!" Luotian roared, his voice laced with anguish as he stepped before Xiang Tianming.

"Big brother..."

"This is too shameless! Did he forget that he had just slain an Immortal King's early stage?" The crowd watched Luotian's pitiful state, his tears streaking Xiang Tianming's pristine robes as he wiped them away with a wry smile.

"You..." Xiang Tianming observed Luotian's battered form but knew his nature. Few could have bested this boy.

"Respectful elder..." Fu Xingyue bowed to Xiang Tianming, aware this might be their lifeline.

"Wait and see..." Xiang Tianming murmured, knowing this was not his domain to command.

"Clan War. This matter is under Huanhai Tian Palace's jurisdiction. Shui Wuqing is our palace's prodigy; we shall protect his clan. I have come to select another genius from the Merfolk Clan for cultivation within Huanhai Tian Palace," the elder of the group declared, his voice unyielding.

"This..." Bai Sha and Jingxiang's expressions darkened. They had not expected Huanhai Tian Palace to take such interest in Shui Wuqing, sending an Immortal King's middle stage and two early stages.

"Shui Wuqing is our Grand Master's direct disciple. Do you dare to attack him?" The elder saw their hesitation and sneered.

"Never!" Bai Sha and Jingxiang replied hastily. Though they were masters, they could not defy Huanhai Tian Palace.

"Then settle it among yourselves," the elder coldly ordered, leaving Bai Sha and Jingxiang to speak.

"We accept our fate. We'll compensate!" Bai Sha and Jingxiang, devoid of their former arrogance, bore bitter expressions as they faced Shui Changkong.

Shui Changkong's face lit with exhilaration. He had not expected a reversal from hell to heaven, the situation shifting in an instant.

"Grandfather! Father, I've returned!" Shui Wuqing's eyes burned with killing intent as he gazed at Jingxiang and Bai Sha, yet he held back. He knew pressing too hard might provoke them into a desperate fight, and their side still lacked the upper hand.

"Only by leveraging Huanhai Tian Palace can we suppress them and extract maximum benefit," Shui Wuqing mused, his intellect unshaken despite rising from a humble Merfolk youth.

"Three elders, please escort my father and grandfather for treatment. I'll handle this," Shui Wuqing addressed the elders, his gaze sweeping over the Merfolk clan: "Everyone, I'm back. You'll be safe!"

Shui Wuqing took charge with precision, and Luotian nodded in approval, impressed by his measured approach.

"Ah?" Yet soon after, Luotian spotted a furtive figure—his arm severed—attempting to slip away unnoticed. It was Bao Long, the one-armed culprit.

"Uncle Xiang, capture that scoundrel! Don't let him escape!" Luotian barked, pointing at Bao Long.

"Got it!" Xiang Tianming extended a blue hand, snatching the pale Bao Long as if plucking a chick.

"Bao Long. I'll deal with you later! Our quarrel isn't over yet!" Shui Wuqing sneered, his eyes ablaze with hatred before resuming negotiations with Bai Sha and Jingxiang.

"Everyone, attend to your tasks. Clean this place! Distinguished guests of Huanhai Tian Palace, please follow me," Shui Changkong, an Immortal King's middle stage, recovered swiftly.

"Old brother, how did you end up in Huanhai Tian Palace? I told you to find me!" Luotian whispered to Xiang Tianming as they walked.

"I emerged from the Dead Sea and found myself in Huanhai. They caught me and insisted I join their palace. Seeing their strength and that they're Merfolk, I agreed," Xiang Tianming replied.

"But I also told them my situation. I can leave anytime, no hindrance," Xiang Tianming responded.

The group was led to a relatively intact palace for recovery. Luotian recounted his ordeal to Xiang Tianming, also mending his wounds.

Time passed slowly. After half a day, Luotian's injuries healed sufficiently, and Shui Wuqing entered the palace.

"Grandfather. Father!" Shui Wuqing bowed respectfully to Shui Li and Shui Changkong, recounting the gifts Bai Sha and Jingxiang had given.

"Return is all that matters. Return is all that matters!" Shui Changkong's eyes glimmered with joy. Though the Merfolk Clan suffered heavy losses, Shui Wuqing's return and Bai Sha and Jingxiang's gifts ensured their sacrifice was not in vain.

"I ventured to explore that trench, trapped by a great adept's domain. I couldn't escape until reaching the Immortal King's threshold, so I was imprisoned for a century. Upon emerging, I found myself in Huanhai Tian Palace, and the Grand Master immediately took me as a disciple," Shui Wuqing explained, leaving Luotian astounded by his luck.

"Bao Long. You pushed me into that trench, thinking I'd die there? Yes, I barely survived—just one step from death!" Shui Wuqing's gaze locked onto Bao Long, his eyes fierce.

"What?"

"Beast!" Shui Li and Shui Changkong's faces reddened as they glared at Bao Long.

"Uncle Wuqing, I didn't mean to... I..." Bao Long trembled under their stares. This was the secret he had kept, now exposed by Shui Wuqing.

"Shut up! Killing you won't ease my hatred, nor will it atone for the suffering I've endured!" Shui Wuqing roared, striking Bao Long's head with a palm. His skull cracked like a melon.

"This must be your sister!" Shui Wuqing turned to Shui Yunqian, noting her unfamiliar gaze.

"Two esteemed ones. Thank you for aiding us in our time of need. I, Shui Wuqing, will never refuse your requests," Shui Wuqing added, his gaze shifting to Luotian and Fu Xingyue. Shui Li and Shui Changkong also bore gratitude; without Luotian and Fu Xingyue holding off an Immortal King's early stage, they would have perished before Shui Wuqing arrived.

Chapter 2350: Blackmail and Extortion

Three figures soared across the boundless sea—two youths and an elder. They were Luotian, Fu Xingyue, and the one they had lured away—Xiang Tianming. After recovering, they left the Merfolk Clan, as tens of thousands in the Star Domain still lingered in Huanhai.

The Merfolk Clan gifted Luotian and Fu Xingyue ample resources, leaving them elated.

"Huanhai is a fine place. Infinite treasures. Even the Merfolk Clan's gifts, plus what we gained from Elder Xinmo's cave, are enough to establish a sect!" Luotian declared, feeling secure with Xiang Tianming by his side.

"Alas for my little Qian. When will I see her again?" Fu Xingyue sighed longingly.

"Once this is settled, you can come to Huanhai and be with your little Qian," Luotian rolled his eyes.

"First, we must find my brother!" Fu Xingyue interjected. He knew priorities.

The trio flew swiftly, meeting the warships after three days.

"Respect our Lord!" The Star Domain's people cried, their voices filled with reverence. Nearly ten thousand souls had pledged loyalty to Fu Xingyue and Luotian, for they had risked everything to save them.

"Rise, all of you," Fu Xingyue sighed, gazing at the ship's crew. He and Luotian landed on the deck.

"How are you all?" Fu Xingyue asked, scanning each face. His brows furrowed.

"What's wrong?" Fu Xingyue observed the Star Domain's people. Their exhaustion was evident, some even wounded.

"Nothing serious. We've been waiting here since your message. But it drew the attention of nearby sea tribes," a peak-stage True Immortal spoke.

"These sea tribes initially harmed us, then incessantly demanded resources. For days, our storage rings have been emptied!" another added.

"Thankfully, you've arrived. Now we can depart without trouble," the True Immortal spoke before Fu Xingyue could.

"Damn it, who dares harm my people!" Fu Xingyue roared. His status was no longer humble—Merfolk Clan's son-in-law, and his brother-in-law was the Grand Master's direct disciple. His voice carried weight now.

"Better to avoid trouble and leave swiftly," another urged.

"Indeed, Master. This place is too vast. Though they seem weak, strong dragons don't challenge local snakes," the Star Domain's people fretted. They had journeyed endlessly since leaving their domain, yearning for respite.

"Nothing to worry about. My status is now remarkable. They'll be lucky if they don't provoke me," Fu Xingyue smirked.

"Ha! Today's docking fee is due!" A loud laugh echoed.

"Rippling waves...," figures emerged from the water, surrounding the ship with countless heads.

"Everyone, we're leaving now!" The True Immortal commanded.

A clamor of splashing echoed as ten True Immortals stood on the deck, their forms grotesque.

"Today's departure requires payment," a crab-headed True Immortal sneered.

"We've paid for two days. There's nothing left to give. Please let us go," the True Immortal pleaded.

Luotian, Fu Xingyue, and Xiang Tianming said nothing, observing how the True Immortal would handle it. They anticipated these sea tribes had no intention of letting them go, merely delaying to avoid casualties and lost treasures.

"Since there's nothing, take their lives!" The crab-headed True Immortal raised his massive pincers, aiming for the True Immortal's neck.

"You..." The True Immortal hadn't expected this sea creature to strike so viciously, aiming for his death.

"Kill these useless ones. No value left," other True Immortals barked, their bodies glowing gold as they rammed the ship.

The ship shattered with a thunderous crash, leaving the Star Domain's people on the water.

"Stop!" Xiang Tianming roared, his azure domain enveloping them. The Immortal King's aura descended upon the sea creatures.

Time halted. Xiang Tianming, a Kunpeng, was rare among beasts, his bloodline overwhelming these sea creatures. They froze instantly.

"Immortal King..." The crab-headed True Immortal trembled, his pincers frozen. They had previously extorted easily but never expected an Immortal King's presence. If they knew, they'd have dared not.

"Great... Master..." The sea creatures quaked. Though numerous, they were no match for this Immortal King's slaughter.

"Damaged our ship. How do you intend to compensate?" Fu Xingyue smiled, approaching the crab-headed True Immortal. He seized its pincer and snapped it off.

"Ah..." The scream echoed as the True Immortal trembled uncontrollably.

"We'll compensate. We'll compensate!" The sea creatures cried, offering their storage rings without hesitation.

"Lao Liu, take them. Your current state isn't right. Don't be timid in the Celestial Realm!" Fu Xingyue ordered the previously oppressed True Immortal.

"Understood!" The group stirred, collecting storage rings.

"Something's missing," Luotian muttered, crushing a ring with his hand. His gaze held amusement.

"Indeed, we've given some to our clan, but we've also lost our own resources," the sea creatures cried.

"Clan? Brothers, go with them to their clan. Lead the way!" Luotian barked at the Star Domain's people. He recognized some of these tribes, including those that had tried to kill him and Fu Xingyue earlier.

"This..." The sea creatures hesitated. They knew visiting their clan wouldn't be pleasant. Yet, recalling their Grand Master was an Immortal King, they felt some courage. The crab-headed True Immortal who had lost a pincer flew ahead, guiding them to the Crab Clan's territory.

The Crab Clan was vast, one of Huanhai's numerous tribes. Their domain lay far from the Merfolk Clan. Three days prior, their Grand Master had returned, immediately preparing gifts for the Merfolk Clan. When the Shark and Whale Clans attacked, they had not aided them, assuming the Merfolk would perish. Yet now, with their resources and territory given, they feared retribution once the Merfolk recovered.

"How prepared are you?" The Crab Clan's Grand Master asked his subordinates, anxiety in his gaze.

At that moment, Luotian and the others arrived at the Crab Clan's domain. They shouted to two crab guards: "Tell your Grand Master to come out and meet me!"

Though in water, Fu Xingyue's voice carried far, startling the Crab Clan.

"Who dares to cause trouble in our Crab Clan!" The clan's voices echoed, several figures emerging, eyes burning with anger.

"What's happening?" The Crab Clan Grand Master frowned, irritation in his gaze. He appeared at the gate, spotting Luotian and Fu Xingyue. His eyes widened in fear.

"Grand Master, they've captured us and demand compensation for the destroyed ship!" The crab-headed True Immortal cried.

"Ha! You didn't expect us, did you? Our Grand Master is an Immortal King. We have countless warriors. See how you handle this!" The crab-headed True Immortal laughed.

"Out of my way!" The Crab Clan Grand Master, hearing the True Immortal's words and seeing Luotian and Fu Xingyue's amused glances, trembled. He struck the True Immortal with a palm.

"Unbelievable!" The crab-headed True Immortal gaped, stunned. He hadn't expected his Grand Master to strike him.

Chapter 2351: Arrival at the Lower Three Heavens

The Crab Clan's people were stunned. They couldn't fathom why their superior position led to their Grand Master chastising his own.

"Esteemed guests, my negligence is at fault. I'll compensate for your losses!" The Crab Clan Grand Master, an Immortal King's early stage, knew Luotian hadn't killed them—there was still room for negotiation.

The Grand Master cursed his subordinates silently. These troublemakers were hard to avoid, yet this fool had brought them to the clan.

"Smart move," Luotian mused, watching the Crab Clan Grand Master with a smile.

"Here's a token of my goodwill. Though it doesn't match your losses, I hope you'll overlook this," the Crab Clan Grand Master reluctantly offered a storage ring to Luotian. This was meant for the Merfolk Clan but hadn't been fully prepared yet.

The Grand Master wasn't swayed by Luotian and Fu Xingyue but by Xiang Tianming's presence. The Huanhai Tian Palace alone was worth the compensation.

Luotian accepted the ring, nodding without a word. He continued watching the Grand Master.

"Insufficient!" The Grand Master seethed, surprised Luotian hadn't even glanced at it. He could gauge if Luotian was satisfied.

"Greedy! This much is enough to buy a hundred warships!" The Grand Master cursed inwardly but smiled.

"Three esteemed guests, I've prepared a gift as well. A token of my respect!" The Grand Master smiled again, offering another ring.

"Ah!" Luotian took it, his gaze amused.

"I..." The Grand Master cursed inwardly but smiled again, offering another ring.

"Uncle Xiang, your birthday is coming up soon, isn't it?" Luotian took the ring, gazing at Xiang Tianming.

"Indeed," Xiang Tianming understood Luotian's intent and nodded.

"Ah, I see. The Grand Master is about to celebrate his birthday. We must show our respect!" The Crab Clan Grand Master nearly wept, barking orders to his subordinates.

Soon after, Luotian received another ring. His gaze met the Grand Master's, who was red-faced and breathing heavily. Though only four rings had been given, they equaled a decade's worth of the Crab Clan's resources.

"Not yet!" Luotian still said nothing, his gaze locked with the Grand Master. Their eyes met.

"Ungrateful!" The Grand Master, seeing Luotian hadn't left yet, felt his heart break.

"Who are these three?" The other sea tribes' captives, seeing the Crab Clan Grand Master's deference and compensation, trembled. If they had brought Luotian to their clan, would their Grand Master have punished them?

"Ah! I suddenly remember... Soon, the Huanhai Tian Palace's Grand Master will also celebrate his birthday. As subjects of Huanhai, we must show our respect!" The Crab Clan Grand Master stammered, nearly biting his teeth off.

Luotian was pleased with the Crab Clan Grand Master's self-initiated excuse, sighing in admiration at his cooperation.

Soon after, another Crab Clan member delivered a ring to Luotian's hand.

"Ha! The Grand Master of the Crab Clan truly is a subject of Huanhai! I'll ensure my old friend delivers this to him!" Luotian laughed, feeling it was enough.

"We shouldn't trouble you further. There are still many places to visit!" Luotian addressed the Crab Clan Grand Master.

"Then I won't see you off, esteemed guests!" The Grand Master sighed in relief, nearly losing his mind. He sent Luotian and the others away like a plague.

The Crab Clan Grand Master's gaze darkened at those who had brought Luotian to their clan, his anger palpable.

"Ah..." A guttural scream echoed through the Crab Clan's domain, causing those captured by Luotian to tremble. They felt their fate.

They'd certainly survive, but they'd endure the Grand Master's wrath. Their strength was evident; if they died, it would be a loss for the clan.

Luotian and his group began to plunder these tribes, extracting vast resources each time. The Star Domain's people were awestruck—Luotian's extortion was second nature, clearly a seasoned practitioner.

"Genius! This Luotian is so resourceful. Even for a son's coming-of-age, he finds excuses..." The Star Domain's people developed admiration for Luotian.

The golden warship soared through Huanhai, its speed far surpassing the previous one. This vessel was no ordinary craft but a mid-tier immortal artifact, seized by Luotian's extortion.

A month passed without incident. They traversed the Middle Three Heavens' coast but didn't stop, passing through another half-month to finally arrive at the Lower Three Heavens' Huanhai coast.

"Finally!" Luotian stood on the ship, gazing at the boundless Huanhai coast. Since the War of Striving for Heaven, he hadn't returned to the Lower Three Heavens.

"Is this the Celestial Realm?" Fu Xingyue sighed, his journey worth it.

"Boom!" The ship vanished, leaving the Star Domain's people elated as they appeared on Huanhai's coast.

A surge of powerful figures immediately caught the attention of those on Huanhai's coast, their gazes filled with awe.

"Who are these people? Could they be from the Middle Three Heavens' sects?" The crowd gasped, their reverence evident.

Not just Luotian and Fu Xingyue, but even the Star Domain's peak-stage True Immortals were top-tier in the Lower Three Heavens.

"Let's go to Shenglong Sect!" Luotian had already chosen the sect's location.

A streak of light, like a dark cloud, flew toward Shenglong Sect. Their presence caused the crowd to gasp.

Luotian's group was comparable to a Middle Three Heavens' sect. All were True Immortals, their aura alone overwhelming ordinary people.

"Are they planning to dominate the Lower Three Heavens?" One sect trembled, watching Luotian's group pass their gates without action.

After three days of flight, they reached Shenglong Sect's old site. A winding dragon appeared before them. Luotian sighed, gazing at the ruined Shenglong Sect—hard to imagine it was once the Lower Three Heavens' top sect.

The corpses of those who had destroyed it were long since collected by Shenglong Sect, leaving only scattered ruins. Luotian and his group landed in the old council hall, dust-covered. Perhaps it was reverence for Shenglong Sect's success in the War of Striving for Heaven, or perhaps no sect had occupied this place. Only a few figures searched the ruins for opportunities.

"From now on, this place shall be called Tianyuan Sect!" Luotian declared loudly, his voice echoing across the dragon.

"Tianyuan Sect!" As Luotian's voice rang out, those searching in the ruins trembled and retreated, overwhelmed by his aura.

"The Tianyuan Sect!" The Star Domain's people gazed with excitement. Though they didn't know why it was named so, it mattered little—they now had a home, no longer to perish in the Star Domain.

Xiang Tianming also sighed, gazing at Luotian standing there. He knew Luotian had waited for this moment too long.

Figures gathered from all directions—Lower Three Heavens' sect leaders, their eyes filled with horror as they watched Luotian's group.

"Buzz..." As the crowd marveled, a golden sun rose from Luotian's hand, sweeping across all directions. Blinding gold light forced everyone to close their eyes.

"Boom boom boom..." A heartbeat echoed, and the golden Time Heart slowly opened. Fu Xingyue watched it open, shouting:

"Star Domain, Tu Yangyang, come out quickly!" Fu Xingyue's voice echoed into the Star Domain, making Tu Yangyang's face twitch.

Previously, Tu Yangyang had followed Luotian from the Demon Realm. He'd made a pact with Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang, remaining in the Star Domain temporarily. Once he left, he'd be free.

"Go!" Tu Yangyang roared, flying up. He had been impatient for too long, rushing toward the golden gate first.

"This is the Celestial Realm!" Tu Yangyang instantly emerged from the World Heart, appearing in the sky.

As Tu Yangyang appeared, more figures followed, startling the Lower Three Heavens' sect leaders.

"One million... ten million... a hundred million... ten million..." Over a thousand people filled the sky, then landed around Luotian's group.

"From now on, this is our home!" Fu Xingyue declared to the Star Domain's people.

"Such numbers! Even Middle Three Heavens' sects rarely have this many..." The Lower Three Heavens'强者 gaped in disbelief. This number alone could rival several sects combined.

"One month later, my Tianyuan Sect will hold an opening ceremony. I hope you can attend," Luotian smiled, gazing at the Lower Three Heavens'强者.

"Who is he?" The crowd felt familiar but couldn't recall where they'd seen him.

"I am the Sect Master of Tianyuan Sect, Luotian," Luotian spoke softly, revealing his name.

Chapter 2352: Re-entering Shahuai City

"Luotian?" Hearing Luotian's name, the Lower Three Heavens' crowd was stunned. Then they seemed to recall something, their bodies trembling slightly.

"Shenglong Sect's Disciple!" One cried out, recalling Luotian's past. They couldn't fathom why Shenglong Sect's disciple had suddenly returned to the Lower Three Heavens and established such a massive sect.

"Are they trying to kill us?" The crowd groaned, overwhelmed by Tianyuan Sect's might. They could not match it.

"Madness! He's Shenglong Sect's disciple, yet he returned to the Lower Three Heavens to establish a sect!"

"Striving for Heaven!" They soon realized the possibility. The Middle Three Heavens had only 100 sects, an unchangeable fact. Luotian couldn't establish a sect there, so he came to the Lower Three Heavens instead. This would also mean Tianyuan Sect would vie for the Striving for Heaven Mandate, with only three remaining in the Lower Three Heavens' new sects. Tianyuan Sect's arrival would also shift resource distribution in the Lower Three Heavens.

"Still, we don't need to worry. We don't need to Strive for Heaven; it's the Lower Three Heavens' new sects we should fear," one said.

"Indeed. The other two sects are manageable, but Xuanwu Valley has been too arrogant since leaving Shenglong Sect. Many sects have been swallowed by it," a peak-stage True Immortal said, his eyes filled with anticipation.

"Indeed. Even the current three sects combined might not match Tianyuan Sect's strength," the crowd murmured.

"Leave the rest to you!" Luotian smiled, addressing Fu Xingyue. He wanted to delegate.

Luotian had named the sect Tianyuan Sect and claimed its master because "Tianyuan" was supreme in Nine Realms, known by all nine realms' cultivators.

"Rubbish! How can I manage so many people?" Fu Xingyue cursed, knowing Luotian's intent. He too had the same desire; neither enjoyed managing.

"I have more important matters!" Luotian gazed at Fu Xingyue meaningfully, his expression enigmatic.

"Go ahead and act like that!" Fu Xingyue scoffed, disbelieving Luotian's claim. How could he have anything more important than this? After all, Luotian had even become a sect elder of Bubu Mountain.

"I'll invite another master and fetch my wife! You have so many concubines, I can't live apart from my wife!" Luotian shot back, annoyed at Fu Xingyue's gaze.

"Ah..." Fu Xingyue felt awkward but then his eyes brightened, waving to those behind him.

"Son, grandson! Come and pay respects to your aunt's husband and grandfather!" Fu Xingyue barked, addressing the crowd.

A surge of figures appeared before Luotian—over a thousand people, both male and female. Some looked as old as Luotian, others teenagers with respectful expressions.

"Aunt's husband, grandfather..." The crowd roared, young men shouting as they gazed at Luotian.

"Grandfather, I grew up hearing your stories..." A youth spoke, his eyes filled with admiration.

"You damned fool!" Luotian glanced at Fu Xingyue's smug expression, his head aching. He waved his hand, sending treasures to the youths.

"This gift is too damned expensive..." Luotian cursed inwardly but handed it over anyway.

"Ha! Go, go. Pay respects to my sister-in-law and bring her a gift!" Fu Xingyue laughed, then turned his gaze to Xiang Tianming.

"Come on, come on. These children are even more remarkable..." Fu Xingyue addressed the descendants, his voice filled with excitement.

"I don't have that guy's wealth!" Xiang Tianming fled quickly, disappearing in an instant. Fu Xingyue's eyes flashed with annoyance.

"Despicable!" The Star Domain's people gazed at Fu Xingyue. They had thought Luotian was despicable, but Fu Xingyue surpassed him. This was their first time seeing Fu Xingyue's despicable side.

"Enough idle talk. First, tidy this place and rebuild the structures!" Fu Xingyue ordered the crowd, starting to work.

"I'll leave it to you. I'll return in a month!" Luotian told Fu Xingyue, confident in his management with Xiang Tianming's presence.

Luotian handed over all the resources he had extorted to Fu Xingyue, then took flight, vanishing atop the mountain.

Decades of silence returned to Shenglong Sect as figures flitted through its hills. But it had now been renamed Tianyuan Mountain.

With the establishment of Tianyuan Sect, this news spread across the Lower Three Heavens. All sects were stunned, for it was rumored that Tianyuan Sect was exceptionally powerful, with nearly a million people—its scale rivaling Middle Three Heavens' sects.
