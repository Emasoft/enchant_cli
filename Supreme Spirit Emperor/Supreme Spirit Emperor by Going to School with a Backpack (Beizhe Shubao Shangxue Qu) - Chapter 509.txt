“Why are you so full of divine energy?” Rakshasa’s eyes flashed with brilliant light, and he could not help but ask. But before his words had finished, Luo Tian once again surged forward with the might of thunder and lightning, attacking Rakshasa.

“Do you think I can’t deal with you?” Rakshasa sneered, and then dark mist spewed from his body, forming four strange ghostly figures etched onto his brow. His aura surged, and the overwhelming pressure caused Luo Tian’s punches to slow significantly, forcing him to spit blood repeatedly. Yet Luo Tian pressed on like an indestructible insect, retreating only to charge forward again.

Boom, boom, boom...

The heavy sounds rose between them as Luo Tian struck relentlessly, each blow repelled by Rakshasa. Yet Luo Tian’s persistence was unyielding.

“This fool!” Rakshasa fought alongside Luo Tian, his mind awestruck. Knowing many prodigies due to his status, he understood that these prodigies were no less skilled than himself. Yet they had restrained their cultivation to pursue higher goals.

Luo Tian, too, had achieved this—enduring so long under Rakshasa’s attacks. Rakshasa knew that the prodigies he had met were no worse than himself, but they had all reached the stage of half-Immortal.

What was Luo Tian’s current cultivation? Heavenly Immortal peak, just one step away from half-Immortal. Yet for some dull-witted individuals, that single step was an insurmountable chasm.

“Kill…” The two clashed relentlessly, Rakshao’s aura towering. But as time passed, his power waned—because neither he nor Luo Tian could replenish their divine energy or Immortal strength within the hall.

Gu Qianxue’s gaze fell upon the battling pair, her eyes widening at Luo Tian’s progress. She knew Rakshasa’s strength well; she had once suffered heavy wounds and been hunted by him.

Time passed slowly, and others began to emerge from the other entrances, witnessing Luo Tian’s battle with Rakshasa. Their eyes reflected shock.

“Who is that man? A Heavenly Immortal peak against an early-stage Immortal, yet he still holds on!” Their gazes were awestruck.

Chen Zhanbiao stepped forward, his large eyes like copper bells scanning the surroundings before spotting Luo Tian being repelled by Rakshasa’s palm.

“Roar!” Chen Zhanbiao roared, his massive body becoming a blur as he charged toward Rakshasa.

Chen Zhanbiao had always excelled in physical cultivation; even after expending his divine energy during the first trial, it had little impact on his strength.

“Damn it! Who’s your brother to mess with? Believe me, I’ll dig up your family’s grave!” Sun Keming and Sima Zhao emerged from two entrances, their voices rising in anger.

“Luo Tian, fight on! We support you spiritually!” But they did not attack; instead, they gathered together and shouted.

They weren’t unwilling to help—rather, their strength was insufficient. Their pitiful appearances revealed they had suffered greatly in the first trial, and now their divine energy was nearly depleted.

“Damn it, hurry up and help!” Luo Tian retreated, waved his hand, and two streaks of light flew toward Sun Keming and Sima Zhao.

Luo Tian had not expected Chen Zhanbiao, Sun Keming, and Sima Zhao to appear here. But now was not the time for hesitation; he knew why they hadn’t attacked and directly handed them pills.

“See? Having a disciple of the Alchemy Sect is great!” Sun Keming grinned, taking out two pills from a jade bottle. The pills were crystalline and exuded a rich aura, filling the hall with their scent.

“Those are pills!” The onlookers’ faces lit up with greed.

Within the Palace of the Earthly King, the importance of pills was evident. Now, everyone’s energy was weak because their own pills had been exhausted, leaving them in this state. It wasn’t that they didn’t want to; their pills had already run out, and the first trial required exhausting all divine energy to pass.

“Looking at what? You want it? Not giving!” Sun Keming gloated, swallowing the pills despite the greedy stares of those around him.

“Luo Tian, we’re here to help!” Soon after, Sun Keming and Sima Zhao shouted, rushing toward the battlefield with Luo Tian.

“Damn it!” Rakshasa cursed inwardly. As time passed, the pressure from Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao was immense. What infuriated Rakshasa most was that whenever Luo Tian seemed on the verge of collapse, he produced pills. The two devoured them like candy, while Rakshasa had none.

And Sun Keming and Sima Zhao joined in, increasing the pressure on Rakshasa.

Others watching also saw this and were stunned. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian’s group to have so many pills, as if they never ran out.

“Big guy! You’re the one who killed my master!” Suddenly, a voice cried out from the crowd. Some were early-stage Immortals, others Heavenly Immortals, as if recalling something, they shouted.

“Right! I almost forgot!” The crowd snapped out of their stupor, turning their eyes toward Chen Zhanbiao fighting alongside Luo Tian. Their gazes turned furious.

“No, this can’t go on—I’ll be worn down eventually!” Rakshasa muttered to himself, aware of the situation.

“Last chance!” Rakshasa’s eyes darkened with cruelty as his aura erupted, surging with all his Immortal strength.

“Ten Thousand Ghosts Devour Heaven!” Rakshasa roared, and dark mist shot from his hands, forming countless ghosts that howled toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Rakshasa! Today is your day of death!” Gu Qianxue rose, her ghostly sword in hand. Though the blade was disproportionate to her body, its black aura radiated destruction, slicing toward Rakshasa.

“Roar!” The ghosts were instantly destroyed by the black blade, dissolving into mist and being absorbed into its power.

“Blade of Killing Ghosts! You’re doomed!” Seeing Gu Qianxue’s black blade, Rakshasa paled. He hadn’t expected her to save this ultimate move for last.

“By my blood, I invoke the heavens!” Rakshasa spat blood, which turned black and formed a towering figure before Luo Tian’s group.

As the figure appeared, Rakshasa’s body withered significantly, his form resembling a desiccated corpse. If not for the faint breath, one would think he was dead.

The black figure’s face was grotesque, its fangs bared as it clutched a black dagger. Its eyes glowed red.

“Mara!” Gu Qianxue’s gaze flickered with shock, her eyes filled with terror as she stared at the black figure.

The figure gazed upon the world, its eyes scanning Luo Tian’s group before settling on him. That gaze sent a shiver through Luo Tian, an overwhelming pressure making his body tremble violently.

“His shadow has manifested Mara!”

“Kid, you’re in trouble. Even at my peak, I would have paid a price to kill him. Though it’s just his shadow, it still holds some of his power. That alone is enough to destroy a Heavenly Immortal peak!” Long Que’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

At the same time, Gu Qianxue’s black blade reached Rakshasa but suddenly halted. The blade trembled violently before exploding into fragments.

“Damn it, what the hell was that!” Sun Keming and Sima Zhao stood before Luo Tian, exclaiming.

“Dragon-Elephant Sealing Prison!” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed, his hands moving swiftly. Four dragons and four elephants凝聚, their golden-black aura roaring.

Chapter 1960: Seizing the Relic ()

“Roar!” The four dragons and elephants flew from Luo Tian’s hands, howling as they charged toward Mara’s shadow.

“Buzz…” Mara swung his dagger, its dark light slicing through the void toward the four dragons.

In an instant, the black aura struck the dragons’ bodies, and a collision sound echoed. Yet the four dragons remained unaffected, wrapping around Mara’s shadow.

“Dragon-Elephant Sealing Prison!” Gu Qianxue and Rakshasa both gaped in disbelief. Due to their cultivation methods, the technique’s pressure was immense, giving them a sense of helplessness.

“What kind of technique is this? It was supposed to be extinct!” Rakshasa’s face paled as he stared at Luo Tian.

“Buzz…” As Rakshasa and Gu Qianxue were stunned, the four dragons wrapped around Mara’s shadow. The four elephants also descended upon it.

“Boom!” A deafening sound filled the air as the dragons and elephants crushed Mara’s shadow, sending a powerful wave outward.

“Damn it…” Rakshasa’s face was pale as he watched the four golden divine elephants shatter Mara’s shadow. He tried to rise but had drained all his Immortal strength in summoning the shadow.

Moreover, the pressure from the four dragons and elephants was unbearable for Rakshasa, leaving him unable to resist.

“Boom…” Under the stunned gazes of the crowd, Rakshasa’s body was crushed into a mist of blood, scattered across the ground.

“Did he really kill an Immortal?” The crowd murmured in shock, their faces filled with awe as they looked at Luo Tian and his group panting heavily.

“Just an early-stage Immortal, yet we were so battered!” Sun Keming grinned.

“You guys are here?” Luo Tian distributed more pills, drawing the crowd’s greed again.

“We just had nothing to do and came to check out the Death Desert. We saw your wife being chased and Zhanbiao being hunted!” Sun Keming recalled their encounter outside the desert, speaking angrily.

“Who’s your wife?” Gu Qianxue sneered, her gaze locking onto Sun Keming. The chill in her eyes made him shiver before he chuckled nervously.

“There was an old man named Zhao and a guy called Jiao San who went to trouble Ran Hao’s house, wanting to tear it down and capture me. I stepped on them both!” Chen Zhanbiao recounted his ordeal, then glared at the crowd.

“Kid, hand over your pills and share them with everyone. We’ll overlook the fact that this big guy killed our master!” Before Luo Tian could speak, the crowd shouted.

“Overlook?” Luo Tian’s lips curled into a cold smile as he looked at the crowd, his eyes flashing with murder. If not for their numbers and the presence of a few early-stage Immortals, he might have already attacked them.

“Want pills? What are you people? Do you know of the Steal God Sect?” Sun Keming shouted. Now that the crowd had calmed, he knew the name of the Steal God Sect would震慑 them.

“Steal God Sect!” Hearing Sun Keming’s words, some people murmured excitedly, their gazes turning to Sun Keming and Sima Zhao.

“Is that the Steal God Sect that once stole from the Nine Immortal Mountains? The Master of Stealing Heaven?”

“Isn’t that sect only led by the one called the Master of Stealing Heaven?” The crowd whispered.

“Still, looking at this fat guy and that skinny one, they seem credible enough!” The crowd observed Sun Keming and Sima Zhao.

“Damn it!” Sun Keming and Sima Zhao cursed under their breath, surprised they were believed just by their appearance.

“Haha! Tomb Robber, you’re such a sly one. The people’s eyes are sharp!” Diaodezhu laughed from Luo Tian’s shoulder.

“The Steal God Sect, I’ve heard that the Master of Stealing Heaven has reached half-Immortal King status. He’s elusive, no one knows his whereabouts!”

“Liars! These two are definitely liars!” The crowd then murmured, their gazes turning to Sun Keming and Sima Zhao.

“Besides, this is the Death Desert. Even if we killed them, no one would find out!” Their eyes gleamed with greed as they looked at Luo Tian’s group again.

“Buzz…” As the crowd pondered, waves of energy spread again, and several figures emerged from the exits.

“Wang Qingping!” A shout echoed as these figures appeared—three early-stage Immortals from the Huantian City, the Yellower Eight Guards, and Wang Qingping, who possessed a relic.

However, Wang Qingping’s face was pale, his body tattered like a beggar, with wounds all over his body.

“Give me the relic! We’ll spare your life and even help you eliminate the Yellower Eight Guards!” The three early-stage Immortals transmitted their thoughts to Wang Qingping. Initially, they had sought Luo Tian’s whereabouts but changed their minds upon learning of Wang Qingping’s relic.

“Dream on! You’ve chased me for so long, and now you want my things?” Wang Qingping’s eyes flashed with light. His head was completely bald, with two scars on his crown.

Wang Qingping’s condition was dire, but the three early-stage Immortals were no better. The relentless chase had left them exhausted.

The Yellower Eight Guards gathered immediately, their cold gazes fixed on Wang Qingping.

“Wang Qingping, give it or not?” The Yellower Eight Guards shouted, avoiding mentioning the relic to prevent the onlookers from developing greed.

“Haha! What do you want?” Wang Qingping laughed, scanning the Yellower Eight Guards and the three early-stage Immortals.

“I’ll die before giving it to you!” Wang Qingping’s voice was filled with madness, his hands moving as a radiant sun emerged from his grasp, hovering above the crowd.

“Is that!” The crowd gasped in awe as the immense pressure made their minds tremble. In a haze, they seemed to see a high-ranking monk in robes standing above them, looking down.

“Treasure! Definitely a legendary treasure!” Though some couldn’t recognize the orb, they knew it was an ancient relic.

“That’s the relic?” Luo Tian’s face showed surprise, the aura evoking reverence.

“Who wants it? Go ahead and grab it!” Wang Qingping laughed, pushing the relic toward the crowd.

“My turn!” A early-stage Immortal shouted, leaping into the air and rushing toward the relic.

“You’re not worthy!” But before he could reach it, others also moved, rushing toward the glowing orb.

“Damn it! Wang Qingping, you’re dead!” The three early-stage Immortals and the Yellower Eight Guards looked grim. They hadn’t expected Wang Qingping to be so reckless, exposing the relic and throwing it out.

“Luo Tian, what do we do?” Sun Keming drooled, watching the crowd fight over it. The clash of martial arts filled the hall with deafening sounds that echoed endlessly.

“Wait a bit!” Luo Tian frowned, his gaze on Wang Qingping and the green ancient coffin at the hall’s center.

“Tomb Robber, look at that coffin. Is there anything special about it?” Luo Tian addressed Sun Keming, pulling him back to his senses.

“That coffin?” Sun Keming’s face showed confusion as he gazed at the glowing coffin, scrutinizing it.

“It’s too far; I need to get closer to confirm!” Sun Keming whispered, his interest in the relic diminished by the coffin.

As Sun Keming pondered, the battle for the relic had reached its peak, with deaths gradually increasing and blood staining the sand.

“That’s a Ghost-Reflecting Coffin!” Gu Qianxue and Sun Keming spoke simultaneously, their gazes on the bright green coffin.

“Crash…” As they finished speaking, the sand patterns on the ground slowly moved, their movement stained with blood, turning red.

“The Ghost-Reflecting Coffin! Once it receives enough blood, its seal will open, and whatever is sealed within will emerge!” Sun Keming shouted.

“Boom… boom…” Before Sun Keming’s words had finished, the bloodstained sand patterns began to collapse. The bright green coffin lid trembled.

“Damn it, stop fighting!” Sun Keming roared, looking at the bloodthirsty crowd. But it was no use.

Wind howled as the green coffin lid slowly lifted, emitting a foul scent.

“Roar…” A roar echoed as the pressure from the lid overwhelmed the crowd, causing those fighting over the relic to freeze. This aura was even more formidable than Rakshasa’s summoned Mara.

“Buzz…” A early-stage Immortal held the relic in his hand, but it was suddenly flung from his grasp, flying toward the coffin.

“That’s mine!” The early-stage Immortal shouted, trying to rush forward but was blown back by the wind.

“Boom…” A withered hand emerged, seizing the relic in its grasp. The hand was clearly not human; it was covered with white hair, as if moldy.

Chapter 1961: Seizing the Relic ()

The withered hand tightly clutched the white relic, and a supreme pressure spread from the coffin. Wind howled fiercely, as if blades were flying through the hall, scraping at Luo Tian’s group’s faces.

“What is that thing!” The crowd gasped, realizing they had encountered something terrifying and no longer dared to fight over the relic.

“Creak… creak…” A grating sound echoed, and a foul scent filled the hall. Wind howled, and a withered figure slowly sat up in the coffin, revealing what was inside. A corpse, as if drained of blood, with white hair covering its body and a terrifying appearance. Its face was gaunt, revealing no trace of its former self, but a dried blood hole on its chest.

“His heart was pierced in life; yet his body has remained intact until now. This corpse must have reached half-Immortal King status!”

“After death, his body remains incorruptible. In the Immortal Realm, only an Immortal King can achieve this. This corpse’s flesh has already begun to rot; it hasn’t reached Immortal King status yet!” Sun Keming spoke softly, his voice heavy with concern.

“Buzz…” The white relic floated above the corpse’s hands, surrounded by radiant light, as if purifying the corpse’s spiritual energy and removing its white hair, gradually revealing its withered skin. A powerful rumbling echoed from the corpse’s body.

“He’s absorbing the relic’s inheritance! We must stop him before he completes it; otherwise, who knows what will emerge. It might be an evil spirit!” Sima Zhao shouted. Though they didn’t know what would come out, they knew that if a spirit was born from a corpse, it wouldn’t be good.

“Before he fully absorbs the relic, we must seize it!” Sun Keming shouted, taking out a yellow scroll and biting his finger to draw blood on it. His face was grim as he worked.

After three breaths, Sun Keming pressed the scroll onto Luo Tian’s body and shouted, “Go quickly!”

“Sealing Soul Scroll!” Gu Qianxue’s eyes flickered, recognizing the talisman Sun Keming had drawn.

“Good!” Luo Tian nodded. As soon as the scroll was on his body, he felt the wind’s pressure vanish. He immediately rushed toward the coffin.

Luo Tian had taken a few steps when Sun Keming, Chen Zhanbiao, and Gu Qianxue also had the scroll placed on them. They followed Luo Tian toward the coffin.

“They’re unaffected by the wind!” The crowd’s faces changed as they saw Luo Tian and his group moving strangely.

Though the crowd was anxious, they couldn’t do anything. Even the early-stage Immortals had no solution; the wind was too strong, and they could only move a hundred paces before struggling.

Luo Tian’s group had the yellow scrolls on them, so they were free from the wind. However, the immense pressure still weighed heavily on them, limiting their speed.

“This corpse must have been incredibly powerful; it even mastered a fragment of domain power!” Sima Zhao exclaimed, gazing at the corpse sitting upright.

“Domain power!” Luo Tian was equally amazed. He remembered the feeling of absolute control over a hundred miles when Long Que used it. Later, he learned that was a domain—standard for entering the Immortal King level.

Before them, they were less than five hundred paces from the corpse. Luo Tian’s group felt the domain power, though it was weak compared to Long Que’s. Despite this, it still increased their pressure significantly, making movement difficult.

“Buzz…” The corpse’s body glowed with radiant light, and its thick white hair was completely purified. Its body gained a faint vitality, causing Luo Tian’s group to feel anxious.

“We must hurry!” Sun Keming spoke seriously, gazing at the corpse, sensing time was running out.

“I’ll do it!” Gu Qianxue’s hands formed a seal, and black runes flowed into her blade. A towering black mist enveloped Luo Tian’s group instantly. As the mist spread, the domain power vanished. The black blade hovered above them, dominating all directions.

“Thank you!” Luo Tian whispered, then rushed toward the coffin. In a few seconds, he and his group reached the coffin.

“I’m repaying your favor for saving me earlier. Though it’s not enough, I’ll repay you eventually. I don’t like owing others!” Gu Qianxue spoke coldly.

“Cut off its arm and seize the relic!” Sun Keming shouted, then took out a spade to strike at the withered arm.

“Crack…” Sparks flew as the spade struck the arm, but it only left a white mark. Sun Keming was repelled, his face pale and blood trickling from his mouth. The spade flew back.

“Not working! Its body is too strong; we can’t cut it!” Sima Zhao shouted, launching attacks but receiving no response.

“Boom…” Chen Zhanbiao roared and grabbed the white relic, his arms bulging as he tried to wrest it from the corpse.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian took out his震仙笔 (Thunder-Immortal Brush), unleashing the Eight Techniques of Thunder-Immortal. The deafening sound filled the hall, but it had no effect; their attacks only made the corpse tremble slightly.

“You… are… doomed…” A cold wave echoed through the hall, shaking Luo Tian’s group.

“Already born a spirit!” They gasped in disbelief.

“How is that possible!” The crowd at the hall’s corner also looked shocked.

“Whoa, this voice… it sounds familiar,” Luo Tian frowned slightly, his eyes flashing with violet light as he gazed at the hall’s corner. He saw a bald man standing there, eyes closed. Then he looked back at the corpse.

“Ah! It’s him!” Luo Tian’s eyes lit up with understanding, but his mind was stunned. He had underestimated Wang Qingping’s decisiveness and ruthlessness.

Luo Tian saw a soul within the corpse, dressed in white robes with hands clasped like a monk. Yet it radiated evil energy—Wang Qingping had taken the relic and was now using it to possess the corpse.

At this moment, Luo Tian fully understood: Wang Qingping had never intended to give up the relic. He had hidden his soul within it, and whoever obtained the relic would be possessed by him.

But Wang Qingping hadn’t expected the relic to be seized by the corpse. Luo Tian guessed that the corpse had indeed given birth to an evil spirit, but whether it had devoured Wang Qingping or vice versa, or if they were fused together, was unclear.

Regardless, whatever was inside the corpse was now Luo Tian’s enemy, as he could sense intense hostility and evil.

“Luo Tian, hold it! This spirit hasn’t fully formed yet; it’s still a fragment of a soul!” Sun Keming opened his third eye, seeing what was inside the corpse. He shouted to Luo Tian, who was a soul-sealing master.

“Soul like a blade!” Luo Tian’s body radiated waves, which the others couldn’t feel but were absolute碾压 for souls.

A gray soul blade凝聚, hovering above Luo Tian’s head. As the blade formed, a trembling sound echoed again.

“What are you doing!” The corpse’s voice trembled, and Wang Qingping’s soul suddenly opened its eyes. Its eyes glowed red.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian pointed his hand, and the soul blade闪动, slicing into the corpse’s body. It pierced Wang Qingping’s soul directly.

“Ah…” A sharp, piercing scream echoed from the corpse as Wang Qingping’s eyes opened, glowing red and contorted.

“You’ll die!” Wang Qingping roared. Luo Tian’s guess was correct—he had fused with the evil spirit, but he now dominated it, influenced by its corruption. Wang Qingping’s personality had twisted.

“Soul like a sword!” Luo Tian ignored it and unleashed another soul blade, striking at Wang Qingping.

“Use the彼岸花 (Biyanghua) — it can absorb all evil and ghostly energy!” Gu Qianxue shouted to Luo Tian.

“Roar…” Luo Tian waved his hand, and three dogs flew out, their massive bodies. They opened their mouths, spitting out a white flower bud that appeared in the crowd’s view.

Gu Qianxue had taken three petals before, and though the three dogs had nurtured it for a long time, they hadn’t yet bloomed.

“Buzz…” As the Biyanghua appeared, it flew up on its own, hovering above the corpse’s hands holding the relic. Waves of energy spread.

“Ah…” Wang Qingping, already wounded by Luo Tian, was now desperate as the Biyanghua appeared. He and the evil spirit had fused; his face contorted, and he was uncontrollable, flying toward the Biyanghua.

The corpse’s spiritual energy spread, and its body, which had gained a little vitality, began to slowly disintegrate. Along with the spiritual energy, it was absorbed by the white Biyanghua.

“What is that thing? Is it an immortal herb?" The crowd gazed at the white flower.

Time passed slowly, and after half a bell, the corpse released the relic and lay back down. Wang Qingping, along with the evil spirit, was also absorbed by the Biyanghua.

The white petals slowly opened, absorbing the spiritual energy and Wang Qingping’s fused evil spirit. The Biyanghua finally produced a single petal, making the three dogs’ eyes light up with joy.

“Buzz…” Without support, the relic fell from the sky. Sun Keming moved quickly and grabbed it in his hand.

Chapter 1962: Battle with the Eight Guards ()

As the half-Immortal King corpse lay down again, the hall’s wind calmed. The domain power also vanished completely, allowing everyone to breathe a sigh of relief.

“Relic!” They saw the relic glowing with radiant light in Sun Keming’s hand, their eyes filled with greed.

“Want to steal it?” Luo Tian’s face showed coldness, his eyes filled with murder as he looked at the greedy crowd.

“Pills, relic, that flower, and that black ghostly sword—those are all treasures!” Their breaths quickened as they gazed at Luo Tian’s group, seeing them like a treasure trove.

“Shameless! If it weren’t for us, the evil spirit would have already awakened. Then they’d all be dead!” Diaodezhu roared, gazing at the greedy crowd.

“Kid, hand over the relic!” Three early-stage Immortals shouted, their bodies in disarray.

“This relic belongs to the Central Heaven Guild; we don’t want anything else!” The Yellower Eight Guards shouted.

“Killed my master, hand over your pills! We won’t pursue it!” Others also shouted. They were just looking for an excuse.

“There are five early-stage Immortals and ten Heavenly Immortal peaks!” Luo Tian’s face was grim as he looked at the crowd surrounding them. As for other Heavenly Immortal peaks and mid-levels, he didn’t care.

Luo Tian knew that even if he handed over the relic, they wouldn’t let him go. Greed was too strong; what they had revealed was enough to make them fight for it, including early-stage Immortals who would risk everything.

Luo Tian’s gaze swept the hall, finding no exits—only one choice: to fight. He could hand over the relic but wouldn’t reveal anything else; those were his life-saving treasures.

“Though it seems impossible, there’s still a chance. Their conditions are poor! If I use that thing, I can definitely kill these five!” Luo Tian muttered to himself, his eyes flashing with madness. It was now or never; he had decided to reveal everything and fight to the death.

“Hurry up and absorb it! After that, help me!” Luo Tian shouted to Sun Keming and the others. Their strength still needed improvement; without it, they couldn’t withstand these people’s attacks.

“I’ll help you!” Gu Qianxue held her ghostly sword and stood beside Luo Tian. Due to her cultivation method, she couldn’t absorb the relic’s power.

“Just you two?” Seeing Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue standing before them, they sneered.

“Of course not!” Sun Keming smiled, taking out a yellow talisman and flying up to stand on the tall green coffin.

“Laozi (I) have spent my life dealing with ghosts and corpses, stealing all the great tombs. Do you think you can beat me here?” Sun Keming shouted, his eyes filled with confidence as he threw the talisman and spat blood.

“Buzz…” Waves spread, and the blood stained the yellow talisman, landing on the corpse’s body.

“Roar…” A roar echoed as the corpse, now lying in the coffin, slowly stood up. Its massive body rose from the coffin and stepped out into view.

“This…!” The crowd gasped, their faces trembling in shock as they saw the towering corpse radiating terrifying energy. Even Luo Tian was stunned.

“Hurry up! I can only control it for a minute. If we don’t find a way out in that time, it’s over! And since I control this corpse, it can only use a part of its former strength—about the level of an early-stage Immortal. I’ll handle these five; the rest is up to you!” Sun Keming quickly transmitted his thoughts to Luo Tian and the others.

“Yellower Eight Guards, and those two Heavenly Immortal peaks are mine!” Luo Tian shouted to Gu Qianxue before flying forward, rushing toward the crowd. The people stunned by the corpse’s presence rushed toward them.

“Buzz…” The “Battle” technique erupted, pressing down on a Heavenly Immortal peak’s body. That person was still stunned by the corpse and hadn’t recovered, being crushed instantly to the ground, spitting blood with a weak look.

“Damn it! That corpse wasn’t as strong before—it was controlled by that fat guy! Look at his pale face and trembling legs; he can’t last long. Let’s all attack and kill them!” Some early-stage Immortals regained their senses, looking at the corpse rushing toward them with madness.

“Roar…” The corpse roared, its body emitting a series of cracks as it swung its withered arms toward the five early-stage Immortals. The withered arms shattered space, and the overwhelming pressure made the five early-stage Immortals pale.

“Boom!” The five people formed seals, creating five barriers to shield themselves. But the withered arms struck them, and the barriers shattered instantly. The five were blown back.

“Damn it! Daring to mess with us, I won’t let you live! You guys were so arrogant before when you knocked me down. Try being arrogant again!” Sun Keming roared, his face red and body trembling violently.

“Why are you still staring? Hurry up and absorb that broken pearl! Once it’s done, we’ll help!” Sun Keming shouted at Chen Zhanbiao and Sima Zhao, who were still stunned.

“That bastard still cares about his image!” Sima Zhao smiled slightly, gazing at Sun Keming controlling the corpse.

“Hurry up and absorb it! Once you’re done, our strength will surge. Then we can help them!” Diaodezhu spoke, then sucked in a beam of light from the relic into his mouth.
