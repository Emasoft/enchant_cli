Luo Tian and the five elders had disappeared, leaving only the remaining high-level combat forces here. They were no match for the old woman, especially with her behind them being at Peak Concentration of Soul and others in the Concentration of Soul Realm.

Wei Mingxuan's face darkened upon hearing the old woman's words. His gaze fell on her before he spoke softly, "Jade Flower Palace?"

Luo Tian had already recounted to everyone the events that took place in the Ancient Immortal Ruins, including the killing of Jiang Lerong. He had told Wei Mingxuan and Zhang Ziping about it as well.

"Indeed! It's the Jade Flower Palace. That boy, Luo Tian, killed my disciple. You all of the Five Elements Sect must pay with your lives!" The old woman's face twisted into madness, her already aged visage appearing grotesque from the insanity.

Chapter 700: The Crisis of the Five Elements Sect

Chapter 700: The Crisis of the Five Elements Sect

Upon hearing the old woman's words, the disciples of the Five Elements Sect displayed anger. However, this was not directed at Luo Tian. They all understood who he was. If it hadn't been for desperation, Luo Tian would never have killed.

The old woman's arrogance and impoliteness were evident. Killing one of the Jade Flower Palace's prodigies, she demanded to annihilate the Five Elements Sect's hundreds of thousands. It was clear she had long been accustomed to such dominance.

"Senior, don't push us. The Five Elements Sect has endured until now; it's not something anyone can destroy at will. Although we've been weakened in recent years, one Jade Flower Palace cannot eradicate us," Wei Mingxuan said, his anger barely restrained as he eyed the old woman with hostility.

"Ah, if it were the Five Elements Sect of yore, I wouldn't dare act so boldly. Back then, the Five Elements Sect was mighty and unyielding. Now? The Five Elements Sect has declined! Do you think these few of you can block me? You're dreaming. What are you waiting for? Go and destroy this Five Elements Sect!" The old woman's face twisted with mockery as she addressed the ten Peak Concentration of Soul warriors accompanying her.

"Yes!" The十几 Peak Concentration of Soul warriors roared in unison before rushing toward the Five Elements Sect disciples.

"Ha! Jade Flower Palace! Even the Yellower宗 wouldn't dare touch Luo Tian, yet you do? You're truly seeking death!" Gu Lei laughed and transformed into a streak of violet light, charging toward one of the Jade Flower Palace's early Concentration of Soul warriors.

Gu Qianshui and Xu Liyi also displayed fierce determination, rushing toward the Jade Flower Palace's warriors. Instantly, a chaotic battle erupted in the skies above the Five Elements Sect.

However, Xu Liyi, Long Jie, and Tian Luo did not attack. Their gazes remained cautious as they watched the old woman hovering in the sky.

Among them, Xu Liyi was at mid-Concentration of Soul, Tian Luo at late Concentration of Soul. Only Long Jie was at Peak Concentration of Soul. However, Xu Liyi and Tian Luo possessed a touch of chaos power, making their combat strength far greater than their levels.

Even so, the battle remained unfavorable for the Five Elements Sect. The enemy had three Peak Concentration of Soul warriors, and they fought without hesitation or regard for the lives of disciples in the Yuanling and Cultivation realms.

Concentration of Soul battles were beyond what Yuanling and Bone-Breaking disciples could endure. The residual power alone caused heavy casualties among the Five Elements Sect's disciples, with each explosion felling countless warriors. Some were wounded, others perished.

"Everyone scatter!" Wei Mingxuan and Zhang Ziping jointly blocked a late Concentration of Soul Jade Flower Palace warrior. Seeing the Five Elements Sect disciples falling, Wei Mingxuan's heart felt like it was being cut.

"One thousand... ten thousand... one hundred thousand..." The battle in the sky lasted only a moment before one hundred thousand Five Elements Sect Cultivation disciples perished from the residual power of the combatants.

Those blocking the warriors struggled to hold on, especially Xu Liyi, Tian Luo, and Long Jie. The old woman's cultivation was too high; they had exhausted their greatest techniques just to barely hold on.

"Roar..." Long Jie transformed into a hundred-zhang-long dragon, darting through the void. His tail slammed toward the old woman.

"Dragon Emperor!" Seeing Long Jie's true form, the old woman displayed a flicker of surprise. She lightly pressed her palm outward, slightly reducing its power.

The old woman had lived for countless years and knew that the Da'an Forest housed the Dragon Emperor and numerous fierce beasts. She could destroy the Five Elements Sect, but she dared not provoke the Da'an Forest.

"Boom..." The old woman's withered palm collided with the golden dragon tail, producing a deafening explosion. The terrifying shockwave spread again across the Five Elements Mountains, killing another batch of Five Elements Sect disciples.

The entire Five Elements Sect was suddenly awash with blood, the square where the sect's disciples gathered instantly stained red. Gu Qianshui and others' eyes turned bloodshot, but they hesitated to unleash powerful martial arts for fear of increasing the casualties among their disciples.

"Luo Tian, elders! Come out quickly! The Five Elements Sect is about to be annihilated!" Wei Mingxuan's face bore a look of anxiety as he gazed at an unassuming rock garden in the Five Elements Sect's rear.

...

At that moment, Luo Tian and the five elders also wore solemn expressions as they surrounded the sect's first elder.

Five-colored rune dragons tightly encircled the sect's patriarch, while emerald flames made the narrow space unbearably hot.

"Come out!" The five elders roared, their hands swiftly manipulating runes that entered the sect's patriarch's body.

Moments later, a series of thunderous sounds echoed from within the sect's patriarch. His frail body suddenly expanded, crimson spiritual energy spewing from his orifices.

"Luo Tian, control the Emerald Crystal Jade Flame and burn away this spiritual energy. Remember, do not let it touch us. This spiritual energy is different from ordinary ones; it has dwelled within the elder for years, possessing a semblance of sentience. It's even become strong enough to infiltrate the patriarch's mind."

Luo Tian's eyes narrowed. He could sense this spiritual energy was unusual, as the Emerald Crystal Jade Flame, usually unyielding and victorious, now showed signs of tension, even retreating slightly.

"Go!" Luo Tian waved his hand, and the emerald flames surged skyward, forming an emerald dragon that roared toward a thread of spiritual energy.

"Hiss..." The spiritual energy and the fire dragon collided, seemingly neutralizing each other. The temperature in the stone chamber gradually dropped.

"Even match!" Luo Tian's expression darkened, surprised at how powerful this spiritual energy had become.

Feeling the threat of the Jade Flame, the sect's patriarch's spiritual energy surged even more. Under Luo Tian and the five elders' gaze, it transformed into a blood-red monkey with crimson fangs, snarling and lunging toward the Emerald Crystal Jade Flame.

"Again!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with determination. He knew there was no turning back now, so he forced the Emerald Crystal Jade Flame to charge toward the blood-red monkey.

"Count on you, Luo Tian!" The five elders' faces bore a touch of weakness as they gazed at Luo Tian, who was drenched in sweat. Clearly, the Emerald Crystal Jade Flame and Luo Tian were connected; if the fire did not perish, neither would he. Now that the Emerald Crystal Jade Flame was being consumed, so too was Luo Tian.

"Must succeed!" Luo Tian silently roared within himself. The flame in his dantian suddenly surged three times, and the stone chamber was filled with fire dragons swirling endlessly, repeatedly attacking the monkey formed from the sect's patriarch's spiritual energy.

Chapter 701: Father and Son

Chapter 701: Father and Son!

In the Northern Region, the Five Elements Sect, once the most glorious sect on Tianyuan Continent and now the one with the largest number of disciples, was currently facing a massive crisis.

Blood had dyed the main peak of the Five Elements Sect red. The sky above was in ruins, revealing endless darkness. The sect's disciples bore hatred as they gazed at the十几 Jade Flower Palace warriors in the sky.

At this moment, Gu Qianshui and others were also battered. Blood trickled from their mouths as they struggled to hold on. They no longer hoped for Luo Tian's appearance but instead wished he would never return.

So powerful was she, especially the old woman who had grasped a touch of chaos power and was at Peak Concentration of Soul. If it weren't for her regard for Long Jie, Tian Luo and Xu Liyi would have already been slain.

The old woman held back for Long Jie's sake, but she had no such courtesy toward Tian Luo and Xu Liyi. Each attack left them coughing blood.

At this moment, their bodies were riddled with cracks; even the flesh of a Concentration of Soul warrior was on the verge of shattering.

"Damn it, Luo Tian! You've really screwed me over. I told you I didn't want to join a sect, but now I have to die with this new sect! Old woman, I curse your grandmother!" Xu Liyi cursed repeatedly as he transformed into a meteor streaking toward the old woman.

Chen Zhanbiao, seeing his elder in trouble, roared and transformed into a human beast, following Xu Liyi.

Tian Luo's face bore an unyielding expression. His eyes held a touch of determination: "I've experienced countless near-death situations in my years. I don't believe I'll die today!"

"Roar..." Long Jie's dragon eyes held endless coldness as he burst from the void, spewing golden dragon breath toward the old woman.

"Even you dare to fight me?" The old woman's face bore a look of contempt as she faced the four attackers. She transformed into a storm, swirling in place.

Wei Mingxuan's face bore sorrow and anger. The Five Elements Sect had been gradually growing stronger, but with just a little more time, it would have no fear of the Jade Flower Palace's warriors. Yet this brief moment had been when the Jade Flower Palace found them, leaving Wei Mingxuan with a sense of despair.

"Even if it were two more months! Two months!" Wei Mingxuan's heart felt like it was being cut.

"Fight with me, you still hesitate? You're seeking death!" A mid-Concentration of Soul Jade Flower Palace warrior's face bore a cruel expression. He brandished his sword, transforming into a streak of blue light that stabbed toward Wei Mingxuan.

"Poof..." The sound of the sword piercing flesh echoed in Wei Mingxuan's ears, making him startled. However, he was momentarily stunned again because he didn't feel the expected pain.

"Boom..." A young figure slammed into Wei Mingxuan's body, carrying him backward.

"No!" Wei Mingxuan roared, catching the young figure. Tears flowed down his face.

"Cough... cough..." Zhang Ziping's eyes held a habitual smile as he coughed up blood, gazing at Wei Mingxuan.

"Ha! I've always hated you. You abandoned us, my mother and me, for the Five Elements Sect. But you were still my father. My mother told me not to hate you, that your actions had their reasons. Even after my mother's death, she told me not to hate you!"

"I can't do it. I still hate you. But you were still my father. Now, with my life, I'll repay your life. It's a debt settled! Goodbye, my father!" Zhang Ziping's face bore a look of relief as he gazed at Wei Mingxuan.

"No! You are my son, Wei Mingxuan. You cannot die. I will not let you die!" Wei Mingxuan's face bore a mad expression as he watched his son, who had fallen into his arms with blood gushing from his chest, shouting loudly.

"Roar..." Wei Mingxuan let out a long roar, his voice filled with endless hatred. His eyes turned blood red as he gazed at the mid-Concentration of Soul warrior.

"Ah, I didn't expect you two to be father and son. Don't worry; I'll let you meet your son soon!" The Jade Flower Palace's mid-Concentration of Soul warrior bore a cruel expression.

Wei Mingxuan and his son had previously held him, but now only Wei Mingxuan at early Concentration of Soul was left. He was no match for the warrior.

"I made a mistake once; I won't make it again. I will not let you die, I will not!" Wei Mingxuan murmured.

"By my life! Reverse the cycle of rebirth, exchange my life for my son's! Transcend and Exchange Soul!" Wei Mingxuan roared, his eyes filled with affection as he gazed at Zhang Ziping.

At the same time, Wei Mingxuan's hands swiftly manipulated, his face gradually becoming resolute.

"Buzz..." The cycle of rebirth reappeared. Wei Mingxuan, however, seemed to have lost his soul, standing motionless in the sky like a marionette.

From Wei Mingxuan's flesh emerged a gray soul, which immediately flew into the cycle of rebirth.

The Jade Flower Palace's mid-Concentration of Soul warrior bore a flicker of surprise. It was the first time he had seen someone use such a martial art.

"Buzz..." Three seconds passed. A gray soul fell, looking bewildered. If someone had looked closely, it was Zhang Ziping's soul.

The gray soul slowly flew toward Zhang Ziping's flesh and entered his body. Zhang Ziping's flesh miraculously recovered.

He opened his eyes, a touch of bewilderment in them. He immediately realized that his revival was likely connected to Wei Mingxuan.

With a wave of his hand, Zhang Ziping retrieved Wei Mingxuan's flesh. His face bore complex emotions as he gazed at the mid-Concentration of Soul warrior: "You must die!"

"Ha! Your father has a good martial art, one that exchanges life for life. But what's the use? It's just a matter of time!"

"Who do you think you are to kill me?" The mid-Concentration of Soul warrior, as if hearing a great joke, laughed aloud and raised his sword.

"Then add me!" A cold voice echoed in the mid-Concentration of Soul warrior's mind.

"Buzz..." In an instant, a golden spear pierced the void and rushed toward the mid-Concentration of Soul warrior's body.

"Luo Tian!" Zhang Ziping's face bore a look of excitement. Upon hearing the voice, he knew Luo Tian had arrived.

"Poof..." The spear's speed was极致. Even a Peak Concentration of Soul warrior could not evade it. How much more so for a mid-Concentration of Soul one? The spear pierced the warrior's shoulder instantly.

Chapter 702: Who Will Annihilate Whom

Chapter 702: Who Will Annihilate Whom!

In the Northern Region, the Five Elements Sect's skies were filled with Yuanling-level warriors clashing. However, the Five Elements Sect was at a clear disadvantage. Although Ji Chen, Lei Yong, and Gu Qianshui had reached mid or late Concentration of Soul, the enemy's several Peak Concentration of Soul warriors made it difficult for them to hold.

Tian Luo, Xu Liyi, and Long Jie were also battered by the old woman.

But a cold voice caused the Five Elements Sect's battlefield to tremble slightly. A golden dragon spear pierced the shoulder of a mid-Concentration of Soul warrior from the Jade Flower Palace.

The mid-Concentration of Soul warrior's face bore pain. His entire shoulder was pierced, and then his right arm holding the sword exploded in a burst of blood mist.

"Ah?" Seeing her companion injured, the Jade Flower Palace warriors who had been in control hesitated slightly.

"Ah, Luo Tian has arrived! Did you mean what you said?" Gu Lei's lips bled as he lay in Wang Yulan's arms, his face showing a gentle smile toward her.

Seeing Gu Lei, Wang Yulan's cold face finally showed warmth. She thought of how he had sacrificed himself to save her and the past events, so she nodded gently.

"Ha! I've finally succeeded!" Seeing Wang Yulan nod, Gu Lei laughed as if he had not been injured.

"Kid, you still have time to chat and flirt?" A deep voice echoed. Six figures transformed into streaks of light, appearing in people's sight from the Five Elements Sect's rear.

"Luo Tian and the elders have emerged!" The Five Elements Sect disciples' faces bore excitement as they gazed at Luo Tian and the five elders appearing in their sight.

"You all should die!" Luo Tian appeared before Zhang Ziping, gazing at Zhang Ziping and Gu Qianshui's battered forms. He saw nearly twenty thousand Five Elements Sect disciples dead, his face filled with cold killing intent.

The five elders' faces were also icy. For years, the Five Elements Sect had never been attacked like this, and now it was threatened with annihilation. This hatred was unyielding!

"Shen Qionghua, you really are bold! You came to our Five Elements Sect and killed so many of us!" Jin Feng Elder spoke coldly, his gaze fixed on the old woman.

"Ah, you've finally come out. I didn't expect you to still be the same as before. You really haven't improved at all!" The old woman's face bore mockery, gazing at the five elders.

"If our sect leader were here, would you dare act so boldly?" Mu Feng Elder spoke, his voice filled with disdain as he gazed at Shen Qionghua.

"Wouldn't dare! Unfortunately, he's not here. He's been dead for years!" Shen Qionghua's mockery deepened.

"Old dog, today I'll see who annihilates whom. Those you brought, they all must stay!" Luo Tian's voice echoed in Shen Qionghua's ears, making her gaze turn to Luo Tian.

"Poof..." As Luo Tian's words finished, the mid-Concentration of Soul warrior who had attacked Zhang Ziping suddenly shattered. Three gray souls appeared in people's sight.

"Come here!" Luo Tian extended his hand, and the three souls appeared in his hands. He pulled them toward Zhang Ziping's front.

"Senior, the rest is left to me!" Luo Tian's face bore a slight smile. He felt Zhang Ziping's current state was not good, his eyes showing a touch of concern.

Since the moment Zhang Ziping had entered the Five Elements Sect, he had always protected Luo Tian. He was so strong that he never let Luo Tian suffer any harm. But now, Zhang Ziping looked as if he had aged decades, his eyes lifeless as he gazed at Wei Mingxuan.

"Die!" Zhang Ziping did not hesitate. His spiritual energy hand凝聚, crushing the three souls and returning to Wei Mingxuan's flesh, as if forgetting it was still a battlefield.

"Die!" Luo Tian let out a cold snort, his body moving toward the old woman. The crackling spear of Rupture Heaven emitted a sound, and he vanished from people's sight.

"Jade Flower Palace! You've gone too far!" Jin Feng Elder's face bore a fierce expression. He brandished a golden sword, its light radiating endlessly as he rushed toward the old woman.

The other four elders also bore cold killing intent, rushing toward the other Peak Concentration of Soul warriors. The previously evenly matched situation instantly tilted in favor of the Five Elements Sect due to Luo Tian's group joining.

"Die!" The old woman's face bore a mocking expression as she faced the five people's attacks. She seemed to be the master of the world, her gaze filled with invincibility as she looked at the five rushing toward her.

"Rupture Heaven Spear!" Luo Tian's figure appeared behind the old woman, and his Rupture Heaven Spear stabbed into her body.

"Crack..." However, the next moment, Luo Tian's face turned grim. The top-tier spear Rupture Heaven had pierced the old woman, but it caused no damage. Instead, the spear took a terrifying arc and flung Luo Tian away.

"Boom..." The other attacks were also blocked by the old woman, and all of them bore heavy injuries.

An invisible wave spread from the old woman's body, causing more Five Elements Sect disciples to fall in the aftermath of her and the five people's clash.

Although Luo Tian's group fell behind against Shen Qionghua, other elders took the upper hand. Two mid-Concentration of Soul warriors were slain by Lei Yong and Ji Chen.

"Damn it! End this quickly. If we continue like this, my people might all perish here!" Shen Qionghua saw three mid-Concentration of Soul warriors had died, and she no longer wanted to delay.

"End it all with one move! Three Thousand Jade Flowers Fall!" Shen Qionghua's face bore a touch of killing intent. A vast amount of wood-element spiritual energy gathered from the heavens and earth toward her.

A series of green petals slowly drifted around Shen Qionghua. People were surprised to notice that, in this moment, the previously aged Shen Qionghua looked younger, as if a twenty-something beauty.

Pressure, terrifying pressure suddenly rose in Luo Tian's heart. The entire Five Elements Sect disciples felt a wave of despair.

"Why do I feel this old woman is much stronger than Jiang Yuanbai from the Ancient Immortal Ruins?" Luo Tian's heart trembled. He looked at Shen Qionghua in the sky, who now seemed like a sovereign to him. He was but a subject; if the sovereign commanded death, he had no choice but to die!

Chapter 703: The Demon Emperor

Chapter 703: The Demon Emperor

Above the Five Elements Sect, Shen Qionghua's face bore a cold expression. At this moment, the five people had all returned to the ground and stood among the Five Elements Sect disciples, protecting them.

"Damn it! Was she playing with us?" Xu Liyi's face bore a touch of anxiety. He hadn't expected Shen Qionghua to be this strong.

At the level Shen Qionghua currently displayed, she could have killed Xu Liyi and others easily.

Luo Tian also gazed at the Five Elements Sect's rear with a serious expression, his face showing anxiety: "I don't know if you can still come in time. Otherwise, the Five Elements Sect will truly be destroyed by this old woman!"

"Can't stay passive!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with determination. He forced himself to rise, bearing the heavy pressure and flying up a hundred zhang into the sky.

His hands also changed, with the King's Seal and Soul Seal slowly appearing above his head. However, they trembled slightly under Shen Qionghua's immense pressure.

"Good kid. You still can perform martial arts despite my intimidation. Rong compared to you, she's definitely not as good. But it doesn't matter; who gave you a powerful support? You still have to die today!" Shen Qionghua, seeing Luo Tian's resistance, smiled.

"Open the Heavens!" Luo Tian ignored Shen Qionghua's mockery and unleashed the Open the Heavens Seal. Three attributes' martial arts slowly merged.

Luo Tian was now at late Concentration of Soul, just a step away from Peak Concentration of Soul. Now that he had merged three attributes, the power was enough to annihilate any late Concentration of Soul warrior.

"Combining martial arts is indeed good. If I were a Peak Concentration of Soul with a touch of chaos power, I would have been wary!" Shen Qionghua smiled and spoke to Luo Tian.

"Is she not a Peak Concentration of Soul with a touch of chaos power? Could she be a World Lord!" Upon hearing Shen Qionghua's words, Xu Liyi and Tian Luo's faces turned pale with shock.

"Impossible!" Luo Tian internally calculated. A World Lord was an indomitable power, unlike this Shen Qionghua. Though she was much stronger than a regular Peak Concentration of Soul, compared to an actual World Lord, she was still far behind.

"Chaos power! Go!" Luo Tian finally revealed his secret weapon, a fierce expression on his face. His chaos power flew out and entered the merged three attributes' seal, creating a terrifying pressure that once again swept over the Five Elements Sect disciples.

"Good! Luo Tian, fight her. After all, it's better to die by your hand than live!" Xu Liyi shouted loudly. As he and Zheng Xin had no secrets, they knew Luo Tian possessed a terrifying seal technique but hadn't seen it yet.

"Is this Luo Tian's seal technique!" Tian Luo's face bore anticipation as he gazed at the gray seal in the sky.

"This is!" Shen Qionghua, who had always remained calm, finally reacted. She looked at the gray seal in the sky and felt a tremor of fear.

"Boom..." The Five Elements Mountains' buildings began to collapse under the pressure from Luo Tian's seal and Shen Qionghua's countless petals. The Five Elements Sect disciples struggled to endure.

"Unexpectedly, this kid still has such a powerful technique! With these two martial arts colliding, besides us, the entire Five Elements Sect would be destroyed!" Jin Feng Elder's lips twitched.

"Go..." However, Luo Tian and Shen Qionghua seemed to ignore people's comments. They were drawn by some force, throwing their martial arts toward each other.

"This is really over!" Xu Liyi spoke, his face finally showing despair.

Countless petals slowly formed a beautiful flower. Under people's desperate gaze, it tore through the void and collided with Luo Tian's gray chaos seal.

"Ah... I hope I made the right bet!" Luo Tian bore a hopeful expression, not paying attention to the two martial arts about to collide.

"Done for! Done for! I never thought I'd die so young. Zhanbiao, in the next life, I'll still be your elder!" Xu Liyi smiled as he spoke to Chen Zhanbiao.

The Five Elements Sect disciples also bore a sorrowful expression, gazing at their fellow disciples with longing. They had felt that under this terrifying fluctuation, no one among the soul-formation and spiritual energy disciples would survive.

"Still..." However, when the Five Elements Sect disciples were desperate, a slightly hoarse voice echoed in their ears. Luo Tian and the five elders' faces all showed joy.

"I made the right bet!" Luo Tian smiled lightly, gazing at the Five Elements Sect's rear that had become unrecognizable.

At this moment, as the two martial arts were about to collide, they suddenly stopped. It was as if they had received an order and hovered in the air.

Not only did the martial arts stop, but all disciples below soul-formation level were also frozen in place. Some still had expressions of shock from seeing the two martial arts about to collide.

Only Luo Tian and a few late Concentration of Soul disciples like Tian Luo and the elders could move slightly, but even then they felt as if trapped in mud.

"Go..." A deep voice echoed again. The martial arts of Luo Tian and Shen Qionghua, at this moment, transformed into a vast spiritual energy, dispersing throughout the heavens and earth.

"Buzz..." A powerful fluctuation echoed in the Five Elements Sect's rear. A golden column of light appeared in Luo Tian and others' sight.

Shen Qionghua was much better off than Luo Tian's group. Upon hearing that deep voice, her face rapidly changed, eyes filled with fear.

"Impossible! It's not said he was dead. How could..." Shen Qionghua muttered, gazing at the golden light emerging from the Five Elements Sect's rear. Her face was full of disbelief.

"Buzz..." The fluctuation echoed again, a brown barrier slowly enveloping the entire Five Elements Mountain. Within ten thousand zhang of the barrier, all heaven and earth were enclosed within it.

After being enclosed by the barrier, whether it was the mountain, water, trees, or even each small grass, they all emitted a joyous emotion, rushing toward the golden column of light piercing through heaven and earth.

"Shen Qionghua, I didn't expect you to be so arrogant. You've never beaten me with that stick before!" A deep voice echoed from the golden column of light, making Shen Qionghua instinctively shiver.

"Demon... Demon Emperor..." Shen Qionghua saw the monkey-like figure within the golden light, her face finally filled with fear and trembling.

Chapter 704: The Demon Emperor's Power

Chapter 704: The Demon Emperor's Power

"I didn't expect you to remember me," the voice of the Five Elements Sect's first elder echoed from within the golden column of light, making Shen Qionghua instinctively shiver.

The Five Elements Sect's first elder was the Demon Emperor, who had lived in the same era as the Dragon Emperor of Da'an Forest. Shen Qionghua was also a strong figure from that era.

However, the Demon Emperor had become famous, and Shen Qionghua was also renowned. She had once challenged the Demon Emperor but was eventually defeated by a single strike, making the Demon Emperor a nightmare for all young talents of the Tianyuan Continent. Now it was Luo Tian, an undefeated prodigy.

"Roar!" The golden light gradually condensed into a set of golden armor, covering the Demon Emperor's body. This made his already aged appearance appear more formidable.

"Ah, old comrade, return... it's been years. I'm sorry for leaving you!" The Demon Emperor smiled and reached toward a small hill in the Five Elements Sect.

"Boom..." The hill exploded, golden light again dazzling people's eyes.

"Buzz..." A golden storm suddenly formed, turning into a golden dragon whirlwind with roaring sounds. It seemed to break through some restraint, carrying overwhelming power toward the Demon Emperor.

"Dragon Stick!" Shen Qionghua's heart ached. She tried to flee but found a golden light suddenly staring at her.

This gaze pierced through the void, instantly seizing Shen Qionghua's soul. She could not move an inch.

"Boom..." The golden staff slowly stopped rotating, with a golden dragon imprint on it. Finally, it landed in the Demon Emperor's hands.

The Demon Emperor smiled and gently caressed his golden staff, as if looking at a child.

"Dragon Stick! Dragon Soul! I never thought it was real!" Long Jie's face bore disbelief as he gazed at the Dragon Stick in the Demon Emperor's hands, recalling a legend of the dragon clan.

"What's going on?" Xu Liyi and Tian Luo knew that once the Five Elements Sect's first elder appeared, there would be no danger. A sudden fire of curiosity formed in their eyes as they looked at Long Jie.

Other Five Elements Sect disciples and elders around Long Jie also gazed at him with confusion. After all, it was a secret they all wanted to know.

"I obtained this Dragon Stick's Dragon Soul inheritance in the Ancient Immortal Ruins! And it was said that this dragon soul was the Dragon Emperor of Da'an Forest. He had a close relationship with the Demon Emperor, being sworn brothers. When they faced the Yellower宗, the Dragon Emperor sacrificed himself to protect the Demon Emperor and eventually transformed into a soul sealed within the Dragon Stick, helping the Demon Emperor fight against the Yellower宗's World Lord!" Long Jie bore a sigh.

Long Jie didn't know that over time, it had been whispered that the Demon Emperor had schemed to trap the Dragon Emperor's soul within the Dragon Stick. Thus, for years, Long Jie had been doubtful about the Five Elements Sect and remained indifferent. Otherwise, with the close relationship between the Dragon Emperor and the Demon Emperor, the relationship between Da'an Forest and the Five Elements Sect would have been harmonious.

"Old comrade, this person wants to destroy my Five Elements Sect. What should we do?" The Demon Emperor smiled but his expression was filled with endless coldness.

"Roar..." A dragon's roar. The Demon Emperor held the golden Dragon Stick, clad in a golden armor. Though he was just a monkey, he seemed like a war god, carrying overwhelming power as he flew above Shen Qionghua. The staff stretched across the sky, striking down!

"Back then I spared your life; today I'll annihilate your entire clan!" Cold words, overwhelming power. The golden staff crashed down.

With the thunderous sound, Shen Qionghua and the other thirteen Peak Concentration of Soul warriors she had brought were stunned, unable to speak. They could not open their mouths.

"Boom..." A furious energy, carrying the Demon Emperor's years of resentment, instantly swept over Shen Qionghua and the Jade Flower Palace's Peak Concentration of Soul warriors.

Under the astonished gaze of Luo Tian and others, Shen Qionghua and those thirteen Peak Concentration of Soul warriors were annihilated instantly, vanishing into the heavens.

"Boom..." The entire Five Elements Sect trembled under the aftereffects of this strike, as if it were an earthquake.

"Too powerful! This Demon Emperor is definitely the strongest on the Tianyuan Continent! There's no one else who can match him!" Luo Tian and Tian Luo sighed in admiration.

"Roar... I'm back, Wang Yue Elder!" The Demon Emperor roared into the sky. His frail body formed a towering shadow behind him, his voice piercing through the void and echoing across the Tianyuan Continent.

This sound caused a stir among all sects of the Tianyuan Continent. All elders who had grasped a touch of chaos power opened their eyes, filled with joy and excitement.

"Demon Emperor! He's still alive. I never thought the Demon Emperor was still alive, hahaha! We have hope on the Tianyuan Continent!" Elders of various sects laughed heartily, gazing at the blood-red moon in the sky.

More people were stunned. They didn't know who this Demon Emperor was, but seeing their long-reclusive elders so excited and speechless, they knew the Demon Emperor must be a great figure.

In the Western Region, Yang Huanyu's face bore a sinister expression. His eyes held endless coldness: "I never expected you to still be alive. You're really a thorn in my side. Now, you must be old and weak. I wonder how much of your former power remains!"
