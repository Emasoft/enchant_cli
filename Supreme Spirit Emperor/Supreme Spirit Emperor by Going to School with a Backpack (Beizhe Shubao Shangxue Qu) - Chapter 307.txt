“Halfway through the Epoch Realm’s power is clearly insufficient. Today, I Luo Tian shall enter the Epoch Realm! Let us see if you can withstand me!” The collapse of the crimson mountain caused the restraining force that had bound them to vanish instantly.

Luo Tian stood atop the sky, holding the Purple Apex Divine Lotus, bathed in violet lightning. He appeared like a supreme war god, his gaze sweeping over the four opponents.

“Rumbling…!” Thunder roared as a golden lightning bolt struck Luo Tian, elevating his aura once more.

“He’s about to pass through the Heavenly Tempest!” Tu Feiyang and the others, upon sensing Luo Tian’s aura and seeing the black clouds above, displayed expressions of disbelief.

“Has he gone mad? We are within his Heavenly Tempest’s range; we’ll be counted as participants too!” Tu Feiyang shouted, his voice trembling.

“What of it? I’ll have you all perish here with me!” Luo Tian’s voice carried an icy chill as he surveyed the four, sending them shivers.

“Madman!” The four thought to themselves, but their eyes ignited with fierce battle spirit as they locked onto Luo Tian.

“Then let us play! A Heavenly Tempest of the early Epoch—hasn’t this been done before? Perhaps I can ascend to the early Epoch through your storm!” Tu Feiyang’s eyes gleamed with resolve, refusing to flee. He locked onto Luo Tian and lunged forward.

“Man’s Seven Steps of the Soul!” Man Hun extended his massive foot, stomping down upon Luo Tian.

Fan Jingyu and Fu Xingyue also chose not to retreat; if they fled, it would mean their Daoist resolve was inferior to Luo Tian and Man Hun’s. Future cultivation would be doomed.

“Crack!” As the four moved, golden lightning struck them all at once, unleashing supreme heavenly power and divine wrath across the Tiandu Mountains.

The storm of lightning reduced the entire mountain to ruins, leaving Hu Tianzong stunned.

“Someone is passing through a Heavenly Tempest—what kind of storm is this? Could it be Luo Tian?” Hu Tianzong exclaimed, his brows furrowed.

The terrifying lightning rained upon the five, causing them to tremble.

“Kill!” Luo Tian brandished the Purple Apex Divine Lotus, his expression indifferent as his body healed from the lightning strikes. He surged forward to attack.

“Man’s Seven Steps of the Soul, Ghosts Tremble!” Man Hun roared, his eyes blood-red. Due to his massive form, he bore the most heavenly lightning. His body exuded a charred scent as he stomped down with his golden foot, striking Luo Tian again.

“Die!” Luo Tian showed no fear, knowing the heavenly lightning drained them all. Without the Purple Apex Divine Lotus to replenish him, he held a massive advantage here. He ignited his body with supreme martial techniques and fought four opponents in the storm.

Chapter 1267: Who Chases Whom?

The Tiandu Mountains could no longer be called a mountain. Terrifying heavenly lightning, like an apocalyptic descent, rained upon them with supreme divine power, reducing the entire range to ruins. Five figures clashed amidst the storm.

Luo Tian stood as a supreme war god, wielding the Purple Apex Divine Lotus and battling Man Hun’s body with relentless punches. He ignored the other three’s attacks.

Man Hun grimaced, striking back with fists that left him spitting blood. Luo Tian fared no better, enduring the other three’s assaults. Without the Purple Apex Divine Lotus, he would have perished multiple times.

“Damn heavenly lightning! Damn the immortal herb!” Man Hun and his companions grimaced, eyeing Luo Tian’s lotus with envy. If not for the heavenly lightning’s suppression and the Purple Apex Divine Lotus, any one of them could have ended Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian!” As Luo Tian fought the four, Hu Tianzong appeared beside him with a grey spear, his eyes alight with battle.

“What do you want?” Luo Tian frowned, watching Hu Tianzong dodge the golden lightning with concern.

“I am human; I cannot let you steal all the glory!” Hu Tianzong’s eyes burned with defiance. He was a prodigy too, unwilling to lose to anyone.

“Good! Let us both enter the early Epoch and finish these royal prodigies!” Luo Tian laughed, tossing the Purple Apex Divine Lotus to Hu Tianzong.

“No need! Their target is you. I’ll hold off two!” Hu Tianzong declined, brandishing his spear and dodging heavenly lightning to attack Fan Jingyu.

“Take it! I’m fine!” Luo Tian’s tone left no room for argument, pulling Hu Tianzong back. He knew if Hu Tianzong were struck by the four, he’d be maimed. With the lotus, he had a chance to recover.

As for Luo Tian himself, his body was an immortal herb. He had targeted Man Hun, who lacked martial techniques; he wasn’t far behind.

“Good!” Hu Tianzong nodded, seizing the lotus and striking Fan Jingyu and Fu Xingyue with his spear.

“Dare you block us? A half-Epoch warrior!” Fan Jingyu and Fu Xingyue glared at Hu Tianzong’s attack, their faces dark.

“Now we can play!” Luo Tian turned to Man Hun and Tu Feiyang, dashing toward Man Hun.

“Fear me? Man’s Seven Steps of the Soul, All Gods Retreat!” Man Hun roared, his eyes red. He took his fourth step—his strongest.

His golden foot shattered the heavenly lightning, which cracked under its might. The overwhelming pressure struck Luo Tian immediately. This was Man Hun’s ultimate attack, capable of wounding even the middle Epoch.

“Blood Demon Chant!” Tu Feiyang’s eyes flared red, his blood energy spilling out as intricate seals formed around him. His body transformed into a demonic specter, his monstrous strength leaving Luo Tian shaken.

Luo Tian faced their peak forms with grim determination. He unleashed the Divine King’s Nine Heavens, pressing down on Tu Feiyang with terrifying power. Simultaneously, he swung the Dao-Defying Whip against Man Hun’s foot.

“Boom!” The clash echoed as Luo Tian’s golden body was crushed under Man Hun’s foot.

“Crack!” Luo Tian’s body plummeted, cracks forming as blood gushed out. His form was buried under Man Hun’s foot, vanishing from their sight.

“Still just a half-Epoch! Without the Purple Apex Divine Lotus, you’re nothing!” Man Hun sneered, staring at his foot.

“Your strength isn’t enough!” Luo Tian’s low growl echoed from the ground. Suddenly, Man Hun’s golden foot lifted as Luo Tian pushed up with both hands, his body surging out of the pressure. His massive form appeared before Man Hun’s head, delivering a punch that shattered bones and spread Dao seals.

Man Hun’s body collapsed, his head riddled with Dao cracks.

“Die!” At the same time, Tu Feiyang shattered the Divine King’s Nine Heavens with a punch, appearing beside Luo Tian. His blood-stained fist carried Dao power, striking Luo Tian.

“Get out!” Luo Tian roared, his body glowing green as he reinforced his fist against Tu Feiyang. The clash echoed, and Luo Tian was sent flying, spitting blood as his eyes turned red.

Tu Feiyang fared no better; though his body was reinforced, he too was wounded. His bloodied arm twisted as he flew back.

“Again!” Luo Tian swiftly healed his broken arm, his expression fearless as he charged Tu Feiyang.

“Still me!” Man Hun rose, clashing with Luo Tian again. The three fought with supreme bodies, blood spilling and being refined by golden lightning.

Meanwhile, Hu Tianzong fared no better; though he held off Fu Xingyue and Fan Jingyu, he too was heavily wounded. Yet the Purple Apex Divine Lotus replenished him endlessly.

Two battlefields raged with relentless clashes, echoing like thunder. The six combatants seemed to forget they faced a terrifying Heavenly Tempest.

As if angered by Luo Tian’s disregard, crimson eyes emerged from the black clouds, their cold aura sweeping across the Tiandu Mountains.

“Rumbling…!” The lightning grew fiercer, and golden mountains descended from the sky, their oppressive presence causing the battlefield to pause.

“Too soon!” Luo Tian spat blood, his pale face gazing at the mountains with divine power. He knew being struck would be disastrous, especially now in his weakened state.

“Damn it! Too many people must have angered the heavens; this is the second Heavenly Tempest, yet it’s already summoned divine mountains! They want to crush us all!” Man Hun and the others grimaced, feeling the overwhelming pressure.

Though terrified, they continued fighting, hoping to kill each other before the mountains arrived.

Yet none of the six were easy prey. Though Luo Tian and Hu Tianzong were battered, their recovery was terrifying—like an indestructible monster.

“Buzz…” A humming sound filled the air as lightning coalesced into figures holding golden spears, appearing before Luo Tian’s group.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian felt each figure’s strength rivaled Tu Feiyang’s.

“Damn it!” Tu Feiyang and the others’ faces changed, a hint of retreat in their eyes. They felt they faced an unprecedented catastrophe; this Heavenly Tempest was far worse than theirs, and it had just begun.

“Kill!” The spear-wielding lightning figures lunged at Luo Tian’s group.

“You! We’re leaving! This tempest is yours!” Tu Feiyang roared, seeing the figures attack. He and the others fled Tiandu Mountains, escaping the Heavenly Tempest’s range.

The four had no intention of fighting further; if they left, the figures would target Luo Tian and Hu Tianzong, who’d surely die.

They默契ly flew out of the mountains at maximum speed, making Luo Tian’s face cold.

“Leave? You think it’s your choice?” Luo Tian sneered, having no other option. If he faced this terrifying Heavenly Tempest alone, he had no chance. Since he’d drawn them in, he’d see it through.

“Tianzong! Give me the Purple Apex Divine Lotus!” Luo Tian shouted at Hu Tianzong, grabbing it and chasing the four.

Tu Feiyang and the others hadn’t escaped Tiandu Mountains when Luo Tian caught up, alongside the divine mountains crushing down on them.

Chapter 1268: Pursuing Man Hun

“Ah…” Man Hun and the others screamed, their faces wild as the divine mountains descended. Luo Tian’s speed was too fast; they hadn’t escaped the range yet.

They had no choice but to fight back, five figures clashing against the terrifying Heavenly Tempest.

Meanwhile, Hu Tianzong left the battlefield, becoming the only one unengaged. Yet the Heavenly Tempest meant for him shifted to Luo Tian, darkening his face.

“Fight!” Luo Tian moved, having no other choice but to confront it. If he failed, he’d die.

“I’m here!” Hu Tianzong appeared before Luo Tian, who had faced two Heavenly Tempests alone.

“Crack!” Luo Tian’s long hair flew as he punched the divine mountain, which didn’t break but recoiled.

“Not enough?” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed as he launched punch after punch, breaking the mountain.

“Boom!” His punches rained down until the mountain was destroyed, but his shoulder was pierced by a spear-wielding lightning figure, blood gushing.

Luo Tian had no time to catch his breath; he turned and clashed with the figures, pushing himself beyond limits in the Heavenly Tempest. His battle spirit was terrifying.

Not just Luo Tian, others fought the figures too. Hu Tianzong, surprisingly, was the weakest but first to finish his battle.

Hu Tianzong had previously reached the early Epoch and prepared well, so he handled the Heavenly Tempest without chaos.

Next were Man Hun and the others; they had faced their own Heavenly Tempests, so even this one was manageable.

The clashes lasted an hour until the figures were destroyed. The five panted, watching Luo Tian still fighting the figures while Man Hun and the others glared with killing intent.

But their intent faded as they saw crimson eyes above, watching them like insects. The heavenly power surged again from the black clouds.

Golden light outlined a golden “罪” (sin) character, radiating suppression that shook their hearts.

“Run! Split into four directions! Don’t let the sin character lock onto you; if it does, trouble will follow!” Man Hun and the others exchanged glances before fleeing in four directions.

“Luo Tian!” Hu Tianzong’s face darkened, worry in his eyes as he watched the sin character.

“Boom!” Luo Tian shattered a golden lightning figure, his whole shoulder numb from the attack.

“Did you learn?!” Luo Tian glanced at the golden sin character, his eyes cold as he looked toward Man Hun’s escape. He knew Man Hun was the slowest.

“Chase!” Luo Tian ignored the sin character, swallowed a pill, and chased Man Hun.

Hu Tianzong followed naturally; he too wanted to pass the Heavenly Tempest and reach the early Epoch.

Luo Tian flashed like two streaks of light toward Man Hun, while the black clouds followed him.

“Don’t chase me! Don’t!” Man Hun’s massive body, each step covering a hundred miles, prayed desperately. He knew the sin character’s terror; he had faced it before during his own Heavenly Tempest, saved by a蛮族 (Man tribe) elder. If it happened again here, there was no savior.

Man Hun regretted his decision; he had hoped to kill Luo Tian before the worst Heavenly Tempest arrived. Who could have known Luo Tian was so resilient?

“Where are you running, Man Hun?” Luo Tian roared, his voice laced with amusement as the black clouds followed him.

“Luo Tian!” Man Hun’s heart skipped, sensing the pressure behind him. He cursed his luck—why was Luo Tian chasing him?

“Ah…” Man Hun roared, not wanting to be caught in the Heavenly Tempest again. His massive body exerted all his strength, fleeing.

“You can’t escape!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed cold as he chased Man Hun through the blood-red sky.

Unconsciously, Man Hun fled toward his tribe’s territory. His massive form thundered with each step.

“What is that? A black cloud?” The Man tribe’s giants were preparing to fight the humans when they saw a black cloud approaching at breakneck speed.

“Someone!” Man Long and other Man tribe prodigies spotted Man Hun’s massive form fleeing.

“It’s Man Hun! He looks like he’s running away! Who chased him so badly?” A burly man asked, his eyes puzzled. This was Man Long, the second prodigy of the Man Temple.

“Prepare for battle!” Man Long’s face darkened, shouting to his tribe. The giants gathered instantly.

But a moment later, Man Long’s face turned grim as he saw the crimson eyes within the black clouds and the golden character forming.

“That’s a Heavenly Tempest! Run, you bastards!” Man Long roared, fleeing immediately.

Man Jiang and others’ faces changed instantly; their massive bodies fled, trembling with fear.

“Rustle…” The Man tribe’s ten thousand giants scattered after hearing Man Long’s shout. Who didn’t fear the Heavenly Tempest?

But the Man tribe’s base had ten thousand giants; they couldn’t flee fast enough. Man Hun, a true early Epoch warrior, was terrifying—his speed made him reach their sky in an instant.

At the same time, Luo Tian chased with divine power, his black clouds emitting heavy pressure that descended upon the fleeing Man tribe giants.

Luo Tian’s Heavenly Tempest was for the early Epoch; even the pressure alone was unbearable for these superhuman and saint-level giants.

Feeling the Man tribe’s presence, the Heavenly Tempest didn’t care; anyone within its range was seen as a challenge to heaven.

“Crack!” Golden lightning, like water buckets, struck the giants who hadn’t escaped, annihilating them instantly.

“Damn it!” Man Hun stopped abruptly, turning back with madness in his eyes. He cursed himself for bringing Luo Tian here.

“Haha, Man Hun! Thanks for the help—I won’t chase you anymore!” Luo Tian laughed, allowing golden lightning to strike him as he shouted at Man Hun.

“Ah…” The Man tribe giants’ faces showed despair and anger as they were annihilated by the golden lightning.

“Luo Tian, get out of here!” Man Hun roared, watching his tribe’s giants fall. His eyes turned blood-red; he wanted to rush into the Heavenly Tempest but stopped upon seeing Luo Tian’s completed sin character.

“Luo Tian! Who is he?” Man Jiang and others stared at the small figure in the Heavenly Tempest.

The Man tribe giants fell one by one, their massive bodies unable to withstand the wild lightning, turning into ashes.

“He’s him! He’s still alive!” Man Jiang, Man Hai, and Man Hong had met Luo Tian before. Their eyes widened in disbelief; they’d always considered him as Guan Xingjian.

“He’s not Guan Xingjian, right? Why does Man Hun call him Luo Tian?” They were puzzled.

“Luo Tian, what do you want from us!” Man Hun finally surrendered; in such a short time, his tribe had lost over twenty thousand.

But Man Hun knew if Luo Tian brought the Heavenly Tempest to his tribe, all ten thousand Man tribe giants would be annihilated except himself.

“I want the Seven Steps of the Soul!” Luo Tian coldly said, staring at Man Hun and stating his demand.

The Seven Steps of the Soul was too powerful—created for the Man tribe’s strong bodies. His own body was equally strong; if he mastered it, his power would rise further.

“Impossible!” Man Hun refused loudly. The Seven Steps of the Soul was a sacred secret of the Man tribe; how could it be given to humans?

“Then watch your tribe die!” Luo Tian coldly said, staring at Man Jiang and others.

“Damn it! You’re not Guan Xingjian!” Man Jiang and Man Hai shouted, their voices filled with anger.

“Luo Tian, we’re here!” Yang Jinghua’s voice echoed as human army appeared outside the Heavenly Tempest. The Man tribe’s massive commotion couldn’t be hidden from humans.

Chapter 1269: I Want the Seven Steps of the Soul

“Let me finish this first!” Luo Tian naturally sensed Yang Jinghua’s arrival and addressed him.

“Good!” Yang Jinghua knew this was a critical moment for Luo Tian, nodded, and looked at the golden sin character above.

“This is an early Epoch Heavenly Tempest; the third island’s deputy leader has entered the early Epoch!” Humans marveled.

“Good that Luo Tian’s lightning tempest is here; look there!” Yang Jinghua pointed to Man Long and others, his voice heavy.

“The nine prodigies of the Man Temple, plus Man Hun, the ten prodigies of the Man Temple have arrived!” Xiang Shaocuan’s face changed, realizing if they fought, the ten prodigies would be a devastating blow to humans. Even Man Hun was beyond their reach.

“Too terrifying! My god, so many people died!” Shen Gongfei trembled as he approached Yang Jinghua.

At this moment, Luo Tian seemed like a different person to Shen Gongfei; though he had always appeared solemn, Shen Gongfei felt a touch of gentleness in his character.

But now, seeing two thousand Man tribe giants annihilated by the Heavenly Tempest, he felt Luo Tian’s eyes didn’t even blink. It was normal to him.

“A tyrant!” To Shen Gongfei, Luo Tian now seemed like a tyrant; human lives were worthless to him. He was about to use the remaining Man tribe’s lives to demand the Seven Steps of the Soul.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian and Man Hun spoke, the sin character in the black clouds finally formed. It seemed to sense their provocation, and red light spread across its strokes, emitting supreme power.

“I’ll give you one last chance; if you don’t agree, there’s nothing to say!” Luo Tian’s eyes glared at Man Hun.

Man Hun wanted to cry, his mind racing for a solution to this crisis.

But before Luo Tian’s words finished, the sin character descended, crushing down on Luo Tian.

“Haha! I choose nothing; you’re about to die!” Man Hun laughed bitterly, his face twisted with joy as he roared at Luo Tian.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian dodged, his eyes filled with killing intent as he rushed toward Man Jiang and others. He pulled out the Thunder-Shaking Pill, hoping to escape this sin character.

“Leave it to me!” As Luo Tian was about to put the pill in his mouth, Hu Tianzong’s voice echoed in his mind. A gust of wind blew, and Hu Tianzong appeared behind Luo Tian instantly.

“Boom!” The golden sin character descended, striking Hu Tianzong’s back squarely. His body crashed into the ground, his face pale as he struggled to stand, his body emitting thunderous sounds.

“Good luck!” Luo Tian sighed deeply; he knew Hu Tianzong also wanted to enter the early Epoch.

After sighing, Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly as he looked at Man Hun, who was still laughing: “Now we can resume our discussion!”

Luo Tian glanced at the golden sin character reappearing in the black clouds, pulling Man Hun back to reality.

“Ugh…” Man Hun’s laughter abruptly stopped, his face flushed red. He hadn’t expected the situation to turn so quickly.

“You must change your demand; I can’t accept it!” Man Hun’s words were polite, but his eyes showed determination.

“Seems you still don’t understand me!” Luo Tian smiled, dashing into the sky above the Man tribe.

“Run!” The Man tribe giants cried out, fleeing in all directions. But thousands were struck by the Heavenly Tempest, turning to ashes and dying under it. Some of them were even saint-level prodigies.

This was because Luo Tian controlled the distance well; otherwise, it wouldn’t have been just thousands.

“Accept or not? I don’t have time to chat!” Luo Tian coldly demanded, his voice resolute.

“If you don’t accept, I’ll really go all out!” Luo Tian’s eyes locked onto Man Hun, his threat clear.

“Impossible!” Man Hun’s eyes turned red as he roared at the sky.

“Ah…” A chorus of screams echoed again. This time, Luo Tian showed no mercy, annihilating many Man tribe giants with the Heavenly Tempest before chasing those who fled.

“I accept!” Man Hun, seeing his tribe’s giants dying one by one, finally broke down. His eyes gritted as he roared at Luo Tian.

“That’s better!” Luo Tian stopped, looking at Man Hun, waiting for his transmission.

Man Hun’s face was red as he pointed a finger, sending images into Luo Tian’s mind. A smile appeared on Luo Tian’s face.

“Then today ends here!” Luo Tian was happy, returning to the Man tribe’s territory.

“Man Hun still lacks brains!” Tu Feiyang stood a thousand miles away, watching the black clouds above the Man tribe. He spoke softly.

“Can’t help it; they’re unenlightened beasts!” Fu Xingyue and Fan Jingyu appeared beside Tu Feiyang, their eyes filled with disdain.

Though they were also from the Ancient Royal Clans, they looked down on the Man tribe; their minds were sometimes too dull.

“This time I didn’t get the immortal herb and ended up in such a mess—it’s embarrassing!” Fu Xingyue’s face was cold, his eyes on the black clouds.

“Who is this Luo Tian? Why haven’t I heard of him before? It’s like he appeared out of nowhere!” Fan Jingyu’s face showed confusion.

“Maybe he’s a prodigy hidden on the Seven Star Island of this continent. The Man tribe’s beasts are now the only humans left in Origin Domain!” Tu Feiyang’s eyes gleamed with a smile, not wanting to let them know Luo Tian came from the Nine Domains.

“Once this is over, send messages to our clans; let the royal clans come and exterminate all humans in Origin Domain!” Fan Jingyu’s eyes were cold, speaking softly.

“Yeah, I thought the same,” Fu Xingyue nodded.

“Once this kid passes through the Heavenly Tempest, we’ll settle our score!” Tu Feiyang’s eyes glared; this was the second time he’d lost to Luo Tian.

With the Seven Steps of the Soul acquired, Luo Tian was satisfied. Now no one dared to disturb him during his Heavenly Tempest. His eyes gazed at the golden sin character above, placing the Thunder-Shaking Pill in his mouth.

At the same time, he glanced at Hu Tianzong, seeing him sweating profusely but clearly using a special method to resist it. His heart relaxed.

“Buzz…” The golden sin character descended, pressing down on Luo Tian’s back instantly.

As the sin character was imprinted, the Thunder-Shaking Pill activated, forming a white dragon that appeared on Luo Tian’s back. It clashed with the sin character carrying supreme heavenly power.

“Crush him! Crush him!” Man Hun stood outside the black clouds, praying desperately for Luo Tian to be crushed. That way, the Seven Steps of the Soul wouldn’t fall into human hands.

But soon, Man Hun was disappointed; after a short while, Luo Tian stood up slowly, his body glowing with green light as he healed the wounds from the fierce battles.

At the same time, Luo Tian handed the Purple Apex Divine Lotus to Hu Tianzong, hoping it would help him.

When the lotus landed before Hu Tianzong, his aura surged violently, as if breaking a balance. He opened his eyes, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Buzz…” A powerful vortex formed around Hu Tianzong instantly, spreading outward.

“He’s entered the early Epoch!” Yang Jinghua was shocked, watching Hu Tianzong standing with changing aura.

“Crack!” As if something broke, a powerful Epoch power radiated from Hu Tianzong, making his eyes filled with excitement.

“Haha!” Hu Tianzong laughed aloud, knowing from now on he was no longer a half-Epoch warrior but an early Epoch powerhouse. One of the few in the Seven Star Island and the entire Man tribe continent.

“Since it’s successful, go quickly!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed in Hu Tianzong’s ears, making his face change instantly. He appeared before Yang Jinghua immediately.

“Why hasn’t Luo Tian’s Heavenly Tempest finished?” Hu Tianzong’s eyes showed confusion, watching the black clouds with no intention of retreating.

Not just Hu Tianzong was curious; others were too, not knowing Luo Tian’s Heavenly Tempest wasn’t over.

“I knew it wasn’t simple!” Luo Tian cursed inwardly, his eyes filled with battle spirit as he stared at the crimson eyes above.

“Come on! Let’s see how much you can suppress me! One day I’ll overturn your heavenly power!” Luo Tian clenched his fists, shouting.

Chapter 1270: Three Fates of Heaven and Humanity

Luo Tian had passed through Heavenly Tempests multiple times. He knew his was different from others, and this one had changed so much; he wasn’t fully prepared. Thus, he was unsure if he could pass through it.

“Buzz…” The black clouds emitted a low hum, their oppressive atmosphere making Luo Tian struggle to breathe.

He had no choice but to recover his injuries as much as possible, striving for peak condition. Only then could he face any adversity.
