“Soul like a sword... Soul like a spear...” The gray soul continuously transformed, forming countless gray weapons in Luo Tian’s gray hands, launching toward Zhou Xueyi. Only those of True Immortal rank or higher could sense Luo Tian’s soul presence on Shenglong Mountain.

“What is this? Could it be a soul attack?” Nie Sheng furrowed his brows, eyes filled with disbelief. He could not fathom any attack so formless and soundless.

Countless gray weapons continuously slashed at Zhou Xueyi’s soul, causing the latter to wail in agony from the unbearable pain.

Luo Tian’s soul returned to his body, his face pale as he spat blood profusely. His heart resumed beating but bore a gaping wound, oozing blood relentlessly.

With a wave of his hand, a pill fell into Luo Tian’s grasp. He swallowed it, and potent vitality surged, shielding his heart.

“Thanks to the timely pill consumption; otherwise, you might have truly perished!” Luo Tian sighed deeply before gazing at Zhou Xueyi, whose face lacked all color.

“Dare to kill me? You lack the qualification!” Luo Tian sneered, his hands moving as golden palms struck again, sweeping across六合 (the six directions), with a golden dragon coiling around his arm.

“Boom...” A colossal golden hand descended from the heavens, pressing with immense force as if a dragon roared downward. It crushed Zhou Xueyi, who clutched his head in agony.

“Zhou Xueyi is finished…” All present believed he had no chance left.

“Luo Tian Senior Brother’s might!” Zhang Xiaoxing and Qian Luofeng led the Shenglong Sect disciples in shouting.

The disciples of Shenglong Sect were invigorated, their faith in Luo Tian’s power now absolute.

“Open!” Zhou Xueyi sensed impending doom, disregarding his seals as his aura surged. His True Immortal early stage strength erupted from him.

“Die!” Regaining his power, Zhou Xueyi’s eyes reddened with madness as he struck.

A crimson hand clashed against Luo Tian’s, the collision echoing across eight directions, violent waves sweeping outward.

“Shameless! He broke his seals and fights Luo Tian Senior Brother at True Immortal early stage!” The Shenglong Sect disciples cried out, anger in their eyes.

“Kill…” Regaining his strength, Zhou Xueyi showed no mercy, his blood-stained robe flaring as he lunged toward Luo Tian.

“Die!” Seeing Zhou Xueyi’s persistence, Zang Yunfei and the others instantly moved.

“Old bastard! You still dare to act!” The Shenglong Sect disciples’ faces turned pale, worry deep in their eyes.

A crimson light pierced the storm, appearing before Luo Tian instantly. Simultaneously, Zang Yunfei and the others materialized behind Zhou Xueyi, their True Immortal late stage pressure slowing his movements.

“You die!” Luo Tian stood still, a sneer on his face as he watched Zhou Xueyi.

“Fool! The pressure is too great, slowing my dagger!” Zhou Xueyi realized his weapon’s sluggishness.

“Let you die!” Their rapid exchange ended with Zhou Xueyi’s madness—knowing his fate was sealed, he had now provoked Shenglong Sect’s honor. No one would let him leave alive, and Zhou Xueyi had no intention of surviving.

“Blood Explosion!” Zhou Xueyi roared, his blood-stained robe swirling violently as he emitted thunderous sounds. Luo Tian’s face paled.

“Luo Tian, beware!”

“Boom…” A deafening explosion echoed above Shenglong Sect. The heavens cracked, blood qi surged like a crimson wave, swallowing all sight.

“What happened!” Shenglong Sect disciples turned pale; the explosion’s power was immense. Had it not been for twenty True Immortal masters erecting a barrier, they might have suffered heavy losses. Shenglong Mountain’s peak trembled.

“Let’s go; this attack was too strong for him to survive!” Nie Sheng rose, taking Wanyoulan’s hand as they descended the mountain.

“Don’t! I saw him die!” Wanyoulan insisted, her gaze fixed on the swirling blood mist.

“Mad! This Zhou Xueyi has gone mad. Sacrificing the Blood Dragon Sect, an opening attack where a sect leader was killed—such matters would never be overlooked by any sect, especially Shenglong Sect!” Sect leaders murmured, scanning the crowd for Blood Dragon Sect’s leader. Yet, where was he?

“How is it?” All turned to the dissipating blood mist, three figures standing atop the sky, their faces dark as rain. A shadowy figure hovered before them.

A chilling aura radiated from the three, turning the world icy.

“Zhou Xueyi of Blood Dragon Sect attempted to kill my Shenglong Sect’s young master. This is an insult to our sect. Today, at the opening ceremony, we declare our first battle: blood for blood to wash away Shenglong Sect’s disgrace!” Zang Yunfei proclaimed, his voice icy.

“Kill…” A thunderous roar echoed through Shenglong Sect as the heavens trembled, twenty True Immortal early stage attendants standing.

“Continue the opening ceremony; return to your places, disciples! Leave this to us!” Li Changfeng called out, calming the enraged sect members.

“Go…” Moments later, Zhao Tielong dispatched ten True Immortal early stage attendants to leave Shenglong Mountain.

“With the Patriarch personally leading, Blood Dragon Sect is doomed!”

“It seems the three elders are truly angry!”

“Still, Zhou Xueyi was too shameless!” People murmured, their eyes on the charred remains.

“Elder, how is Luo Tian?” A disciple asked, concern in his voice.

“He still has breath; continue! We’ll return to the back mountain to rescue him!” Zang Yunfei said, then flew with Peijianping.

“Those Blood Dragon Sect scum dared to provoke Shenglong Sect! They deserve death!” A disciple cursed.

“Master Li, we’ll take our leave!” With the situation escalated, sect leaders departed.

“Good, thank you for coming. In a year, Shenglong Sect will enter the Huantian Sea to compete in the Struggle for Heaven!” Li Changfeng and others announced, bidding farewell.

In Shenglong Sect’s back mountain, Zang Yunfei and Peijianping carried Luo Tian, his body charred black.

“Kid, enough!” Zang Yunfei scolded the charcoal-like Luo Tian, a sly grin on his face.

“Old Zang, I’m really hurt! So damned serious; if not for my thick skin, I’d be reduced to ashes! As elders, you should care and give me some immortal pills!” Luo Tian cursed.

A white tooth peeked from his charred body, then blackened skin peeled away, revealing a jade-like form before Zang Yunfei and Peijianping.

“Tsk tsk, thanks to the Hundred Forges Body Technique’s small success; otherwise, I wouldn’t have survived!” Luo Tian sighed, recalling the explosion’s terror.

“Fortune favors the bold; your fake death was brilliant! Now, Shenglong Sect unites against Blood Dragon Sect!” Zang Yunfei grinned.

“I’m a hero! Reward me with some top-tier immortal weapons and immortal pills!” Luo Tian demanded, knowing these three elders would give him whatever they could.

“Alas… with the three sects merged, resources are scarce. Wait a while; we’ll record your feat and reward you later!” Zang Yunfei smiled.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian shook his head, knowing it was futile. Yet Zang Yunfei’s words made sense; he’d grown stronger with them.

“Your thoughts on Blood Dragon Sect?” Zang Yunfei turned serious, addressing Luo Tian and Peijianping.

“Likely hatred; Blood Dragon Sect is ruthless, acting without consequence,” Peijianping murmured.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, sensing something amiss. He recalled Guan Hongsheng—due to the Epoch Book, he knew Guan was still alive.

“True Immortal peak, Pure Yang True Immortal!” Luo Tian mused, his eyes gleaming. His strength was formidable; even against True Immortal early stage, he could escape. He knew Guan Hongsheng would not relent; being targeted was no joy, especially by someone like Guan.

Luo Tian felt Zhou Xueyi’s incident hinted at Guan Hongsheng, and he spotted a familiar figure—Wanyoulan.

Chapter 1939: Meeting Zuo Qiu Ming

Luo Tian, Shenglong Sect’s young master, had become a legend. Now all of the Lower Heavens knew his name. Rumors of his strength were mere whispers, but this battle was witnessed by sect leaders and geniuses.

A True Immortal late stage could not defeat him; a True Immortal early stage with self-sealed power was no match. Even a True Immortal early stage using explosive techniques survived—such feats were rare, achieved only by the most brilliant geniuses.

“First among True Immortals!” The Lower Heavens hailed Luo Tian.

With Shenglong Sect’s opening ceremony concluded, another sect gained fame—Zhou Xueyi’s attempt to kill Luo Tian would not be overlooked.

Zhao Tielong led ten True Immortal early stage disciples to destroy Blood Dragon Sect. Killing them was trivial; their strongest, the Blood Dragon Patriarch, was only True Immortal mid-stage.

Yet when Zhao Tielong found Blood Dragon Sect, it was abandoned—only a few Heavenly Immortal mid-stage elders remained, left as pawns.

Arriving with fury, they caught only minor targets. This enraged Zhao Tielong further; after merging sects, such an insult was unacceptable. Shenglong Sect launched massive bounties for Blood Dragon Sect’s whereabouts.

Shenglong Sect disciples also scoured Shenglong Mountain, rewarded for any leads. Yet after half a month, no clues emerged—Blood Dragon Sect vanished like smoke.

“Usually others hunted me; now I’m the hunter!” Luo Tian stood in a grand hall, roaring internally. If alone, he’d weep.

Pursuit and bounty—these years had been relentless for Luo Tian, life and death. This hunt of Blood Dragon Sect was his own decree, a long-awaited triumph.

“Luo Tian Senior Brother, what are you doing? Laughing so lewdly?” In the hall, young figures stood, watching Luo Tian’s grin.

“Who knows? Perhaps thinking of something good!” They murmured, these being the former three sects’ geniuses.

Chen Zhanbiao, Zhao Tiecheng, Zhao Tiancheng, Zhang Xiaoxing, Qian Luofeng—fifteen youths, each a genius. Though no match for Luo Tian, they rivaled previous geniuses like Zhu Fenghuo and Ruan Xinghe. Zhao Tiecheng and Zhao Tiancheng even surpassed them.

These were Luo Tian’s disciplinary court, future pillars of Shenglong Sect, its fresh blood.

“Elder!” A booming voice echoed in the hall as Chen Zhanbiao addressed Luo Tian, shaking the hall.

“Hm… Ah…”

“Everyone, we’re no longer strangers. Our disciplinary court has just formed; I hope cooperation in the future!” Luo Tian addressed them, recovering from his injuries.

“One request: fairness! But don’t fear; I’ll be your strongest support!”

“Enough, go do your jobs. Recruit disciples!” Luo Tian ordered.

Hearing this, they hesitated, gazing at Luo Tian, making him slightly embarrassed.

“Great Elder, the great leader! Have you finished?” Zhang Xiaoxing asked, bewildered.

“Indeed, done! What else is there to do?” Luo Tian mirrored their confusion. Except Chen Zhanbiao, all wore blank expressions—Chen had been confused from the start.

“Knowing you’d be a lazy leader, but your laziness is too obvious! At least assign tasks—like who supervises which hall!” Diao Dedu leaned back, addressing Luo Tian.

“Zhang Xiaoxing, supervise the Dragon Hall… Qian Luofeng, supervise the Earth Hall…” Luo Tian’s face flushed awkwardly.

“Supreme Elder commands the disciplinary court!” Luo Tian declared solemnly, making their lips twitch.

“Go!” Luo Tian waved, becoming a lazy leader, giving them an encouraging glance.

“Yes!” Only Chen Zhanbiao remained as the others exited.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian sighed, rising slowly with Chen Zhanbiao to leave the disciplinary hall.

Walking on Shenglong Sect’s wide road, disciples bowed respectfully, greeting Luo Tian.

Luo Tian and Chen Zhanbiao reached the Dragon Hall, where chaos reigned—disciples bustled about. Zuo Qiu Ming stood there, directing them.

“Brother!” Seeing Luo Tian, Zuo Qiu Ming laughed heartily, approaching him.

“Elder!” Luo Tian smiled, stepping into the crowd.

“Why come to me? The halls just formed; aren’t you busy?” Zuo Qiu Ming asked, puzzled.

“Brothers haven’t spoken in a while; I came to visit you!” Luo Tian blushed, seeing Zuo Qiu Ming’s busyness.

“Come, let your sister-in-law cook a few dishes; we’ll drink!” Zuo Qiu Ming led Luo Tian into the inner courtyard.

“Xiaotian arrived!” Xue Yushan smiled, her belly swollen, stepping out.

“Sister-in-law well?” Luo Tian greeted Xue Yushan, then the four entered the living room.

“Thank you for your help; today, let’s chat!” Xue Yushan chuckled, leaving to order food.

Soon, a table of wine and dishes appeared. Luo Tian and Zuo Qiu Ming raised cups, smiling.

“Elder, I must accept this young master role!” Luo Tian said, gazing at Zuo Qiu Ming.

“Brothers need no formalities; regarding your father-in-law, I hope you don’t take it to heart!” Zuo Qiu Ming sighed.

Luo Tian’s image had shown him; he knew Du Chengshi and Xue Changshan were close, but Du had attacked Luo Tian mid-journey. Zuo Qiu Ming understood this tied to Xue Changshan.

“Elder, don’t mind; your father-in-law is my brother-in-law. I won’t hold it against him. But if this happens again, I’ll have no choice but to resist!” Luo Tian murmured, his voice cold.

Though he could kill Xue Changshan now, with Zang Yunfei and others supporting him, it wasn’t hard. Yet he chose not to—first, Xue had helped him; second, this visit aimed to gauge Zuo Qiu Ming’s stance. If Zuo changed, he’d eliminate Xue.

“Brother, I knew you weren’t ordinary; your future would be great. But I didn’t expect this speed!” Zuo Qiu Ming sighed, recalling their first meeting in Tianlong City.

“If not for you, I wouldn’t have become young master so fast. But elder, prepare yourself; soon, I’ll gift you a great present!” Luo Tian sighed.

No matter the reason, he knew he’d never be Shenglong Sect’s master—his lineage was Tiandao Sect, destined to oppose the Eternal Immortal King. His nature wasn’t fit for a master; also, killing Huang Youshan in the Middle Heavens was another trouble.

“Brother, what do you mean?” Zuo Qiu Ming was confused; he didn’t know what “great present” meant.

“Elder, improve your strength! Only then can you qualify; otherwise, it’s all for nothing!” Luo Tian shook his head, waving a hand. A series of vials flew from his grasp to Zuo Qiu Ming’s front.

“These elixirs are my niece’s gift. Here, I’ve crafted them; others were made by Master Xuan Dan. All are yin-type. If my guess is right, you’ll have a daughter. These herbs will let her reach Heavenly Immortal stage before thirty!” Luo Tian murmured.

“This…” Zuo Qiu Ming was stunned, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Originally, your Mo Shuang Spider Venom wasn’t fully removed; it transferred to your niece. Cold venom is yin-type, so eight chances she’s a daughter. Don’t worry; your niece won’t be affected and will have top-tier talent. Practicing cold-type techniques will double her progress!” Luo Tian explained.

“Ha! I won’t be formal; thank you, brother!” Zuo Qiu Ming laughed, storing the vials. No father would refuse his child’s gift.

“Taste my sister-in-law’s…” Zuo Qiu Ming smiled, gesturing Luo Tian to eat. But looking down, the table was empty—stacks of licked-clean plates were before Chen Zhanbiao.

Luo Tian, seeing Chen’s hungry expression, blushed awkwardly.

“Luo Tian! Come here! There’s something big!” Yunfei Elder’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

“Elder, Yunfei Elder needs me; I’ll go!” Luo Tian hurriedly said, no longer needing to stay. He grabbed Chen Zhanbiao and left the living room.

Chapter 1940: Nie Sheng Demands a Person

In Shenglong Mountain’s serene hall, Zang Yunfei, Zhao Tielong, and Peijianping sat with grim faces, brows furrowed.

Beside them, a youth sat, smiling. A slender woman stood behind him, her white hands gently resting on his shoulders.

“Three of you, have you decided?” The youth asked softly, scanning Zang Yunfei.

“Luo Tian is Shenglong Sect’s young master; this matter is too big. Give me time to think!” Zang Yunfei replied gently.

“Fine, I’ll give you three days. Return then; hope for a satisfactory answer!” The youth stood, his eyes flickering with displeasure. He strode out.

Luo Tian walked with Chen Zhanbiao, puzzled about the three elders’ purpose. Entering the back mountain, a man and woman met him.

“Wan Youlan!” Luo Tian was startled; Nie Sheng and Wan Youlan were equally surprised. Yet Nie’s face smiled, while Wan’s bore a sneer toward Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian! Never expected to meet you here!” Wan Youlan coldly gazed at him.

“Ah, it’s you! I thought it was a fly; came to find a leg here? How long has your husband been dead, and you’ve already lost control?” Luo Tian smirked.

“Don’t speak nonsense; I’m just a cousin!” Wan Youlan, seeing Nie’s darkening face, protested.

“Ha! Cousin? Then you’re inbreeding! I didn’t know your family had such traditions. If I were your cousin, the one in heaven would be restless! Your name is good—‘Ten Thousand’... ‘Play with Orchid’!” Luo Tian roared, relaying Diao Dedu’s whispers.

“Silence!” Nie and Wan Youlan both spoke, but Wan’s voice was quieter.

“You never told me you had a cousin!” Nie glared, slapping Wan Youlan’s face.

“Master…”

“Silence! Come to my room tonight!” Nie coldly ordered, his voice unyielding.

“You too, my woman isn’t for you to insult! I’ll make you suffer and die!” Nie declared, gazing at Luo Tian.

“You’re nothing!” Chen Zhanbiao stepped forward, roaring as he lunged at Nie. His fist surged with power, striking Nie’s head.

Nie smiled contemptuously, grabbing Chen Zhanbiao’s fist.

“Boom…” A dull sound echoed between them; both stood motionless, like statues.

“Crack….” Chen Zhanbiao’s thick arm bulged with veins, like an old tree. Nie’s face showed concern; his fingers whitened from force.

“Zhanbiao, return!” Luo Tian frowned, but his mind was grim—Chen Zhanbiao’s furious fist held immense power. This youth remained unmoved, matching him in strength. It proved his background was formidable.

“Elder…” Chen Zhanbiao’s eyes showed defiance, retracting his fist to Luo Tian’s side. Yet he glared at Nie, breathing heavily.

“Who are you?” Luo Tian asked softly. This youth’s arrival had allowed the three elders to let him leave—evidently, he was no ordinary person.

Moreover, the clash revealed his cultivation: Heavenly Immortal peak. To reach this stage at such youth was rare; Luo Tian knew his background was formidable.

“You’re nothing! You don’t deserve to know my master’s name!” Wan Youlan shouted, sneering at Luo Tian.

“Slut, don’t speak; I find it dirty!” Luo Tian coldly replied, but his gaze remained on Nie.

“You…”

“Listen: my master is Nie Sheng, the most beloved son of Master Nie Yuntian of the Nine Heavens’ Mountains, Eternal Immortal King!” Wan Youlan announced, her face distorted with hatred.

Nie Sheng’s identity was enough to make many kneel—even Zang Yunfei and others were stunned.

“Eternal Mountain, Eternal Immortal King!” Luo Tian’s heart trembled; he hadn’t expected to meet someone tied to the Eternal Mountain.

“How? Scared?” Wan Youlan sneered, waiting for Luo Tian to be shocked.

“Then what? You’ll suffer and die; in three days, your master will personally strip you of power!”

“How does it feel to be crushed by your so-called powerful support?” Nie Sheng’s face was icy.

“Ah…” Luo Tian felt a chill; if Nie Sheng’s words were true, he couldn’t escape. Yet his face showed no fear, a smile on it, making Wan Youlan feel trapped.

“Enough; nothing to do here. I don’t want to kill today!” Luo Tian said softly, ignoring Nie Sheng’s words.

“You don’t know what you’re saying! In the Middle or Upper Heavens, this sentence would kill you ten times!” Nie Sheng’s face darkened.

“Unfortunately, this is the Lower Heavens; if you act, I’ll accompany!” Luo Tian smiled.

“You’re unworthy! Killing you would soil my hands; I’ll wait for your master to deliver you!” Nie Sheng said, taking Wan Youlan and leaving.

Luo Tian didn’t act; he knew the three elders wouldn’t let him kill Nie Sheng.

“Elder, if there’s anything, can you protect me?” Luo Tian’s face darkened, standing still. He sent a mental message to the sparrow in his Beast Sealing Seal, preparing for the worst.

“No time; unless you agree to a condition, I’ll need food monthly!” The sparrow’s lazy voice echoed.

“Come in, kid!” As Luo Tian conversed with the sparrow, Zang Yunfei’s voice echoed.

“Yes!” Luo Tian adjusted his clothes and entered the elders’ courtyard, his face calm.

“Elder Zang, Elder Pei, Elder Zhao, what did you call me for?” Luo Tian asked upon entering.

“You’ve caused trouble!” They smiled bitterly, but admiration flickered in their eyes at his calmness.

“Elder Zang, what’s your plan?” Luo Tian stared intently, confident they wouldn’t betray him.

“They’re backed by the Eternal Mountain!”

“And they promised we’d win the Struggle for Heaven, entering the Middle Heavens; no sect would oppress Shenglong Sect!” Zang Yunfei said.

“Elders, are you planning to abandon me?” Luo Tian asked softly, disappointment in his voice.

“No; we don’t want to abandon you. We know you; if cornered, you wouldn’t drag us down!”

“So we ask: what’s your plan? As long as we three are here, we’ll protect you. You contributed to the sect merger; how could we hand you over? And handing you would hurt Shenglong Sect’s disciples!” Zhao Tielong roared.

Zhao was right; without Luo Tian, the three sects wouldn’t have merged so swiftly. Even between them, there had been gaps—only through teaching Luo Tian did they reconcile.

“Elders, dare to gamble once! If successful, Shenglong Sect will reach Nie Sheng’s claim. If failed, it’ll stay in the Lower Heavens!” Luo Tian murmured.

“Do you have a plan?” They tensed, intending to contact Jiang Taibai via the Huantian Island. If Jiang intervened, all problems would vanish.

Yet they didn’t know Jiang Taibai and Luo Tian were strangers; only a connection with Jiang Yuzhe.

“Elders, don’t interfere! Leave it to me; I’ll give you a satisfactory answer!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed coldly.

“No, your plan needs our help; success chances are higher!” Zang Yunfei shook his head.

“Fine, three days later, let Nie Sheng come for him. Once captured, the rest is mine!” Luo Tian said, but no matter their questions, he spoke no more.

Luo Tian bid farewell to the three elders, returning to the disciplinary court with Chen Zhanbiao. Though absent, it remained lively—Zhang Xiaoxing and Zhao Tiancheng busied themselves.

Everyone in Shenglong Sect knew the disciplinary court was the most prestigious, so many sought to join.

Chapter 1941: Cultivating Soul-Heart Seeding Demon

“Elder, don’t deceive me; this technique truly can’t be broken by even an Immortal King?” Luo Tian sat on his bed, conversing with the sparrow in his Beast Sealing Seal.

“Rest assured; this Soul-Heart Seeding Demon is no ordinary technique! Even Immortal Kings would covet it. It’s not from the Heavenly realm!” The sparrow replied confidently.

“Fine! I trust you!” Luo Tian nodded, then sat cross-legged on his bed, practicing the incantation given by the sparrow.

Luo Tian’s plan was to cultivate Soul-Heart Seeding Demon, implanting a demon seed in Nie Sheng to control him. Thus, Nie would be constrained by him.

Previously, the sparrow had wanted to teach Luo Tian this technique but was rejected—Luo Tian felt it too ruthless, against Heaven’s will.

But now, he had no choice; he’d requested the technique from the sparrow, paying a price: monthly, one hundred demon seeds of Heavenly Immortal mid-stage, or ten of late stage, five of peak stage, or one half-True Immortal.

“That’s it? Cultivators are all ruthless! How many bloodstains have you stained? What’s against Heaven’s will? As long as your soul is steady, killing many doesn’t matter! I once was severely wounded, chased for a century. Later, after escaping, my injuries recovered slightly. I returned and wiped out their clan, burning three million people!” The sparrow’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

“Elder, what are you?!” Hearing the sparrow’s words, Luo Tian was startled; this was the first time it revealed its identity.

“Kid, I’m not a thing! Don’t pry; my identity isn’t something you can grasp now!” The sparrow sneered.

“Elder, I can’t keep calling you ‘Sparrow’! After all, you’re so mighty!” Luo Tian quickly said, curiosity piqued.

“That’s right! I’m mighty; it’s an honor to be in your Beast Sealing Seal. So treat me well—benefits won’t lack! Your dragon inside is mighty, but it calls me ‘Grandfather’!” The sparrow heard his flattery.

“Impossible! Dragon Emperor is the king of fierce beasts; I don’t know any beast bloodline stronger than Longjie!” Luo Tian murmured, disdain in his voice. Yet the sparrow seemed provoked.

“Dragon Emperor? What’s that? Just a small eel! At most, an Immortal King! Not even worthy to tie my shoes!” The sparrow roared.

“Impossible, elder, don’t boast! Bloodline doesn’t equate to strength! Though your bloodline isn’t great, you’re still a master. Like the little fox beside me—his bloodline isn’t as strong as Dragon Emperor, but he’ll become a master like you!” Luo Tian’s eyes brightened, sensing the sparrow’s weakness.

“You damned fool! You compare me to those two little trash! In my eyes, they’re all dirt!” The sparrow’s feathers flared as it flew out of the Beast Sealing Seal.

“Come on, bring that little eel out; let him call me Grandfather!” The sparrow roared, fluffing its feathers.

“I won’t! What can you do?” Diao Dedu, perched on Luo Tian’s shoulder, retorted, his heart drumming with fear the ancestor might burn him and Luo Tian to ashes.
