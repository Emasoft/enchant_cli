Flames erupted wildly, a deep wound instantly appearing on the abdomen of the Three-Feet Golden Crow. Golden divine blood spilled forth continuously.

Luo Tian had unleashed his entire strength with this strike, a blade at the peak of his abilities. Even when Jin Zi Yang transformed into his true form, he could not withstand it.

Amidst the surging black demonic energy, it surged into Jin Zi Yang's body. Yet Jin Zi Yang was no ordinary talent of the Origin Domain's first-rate prodigies; in his agony, golden sharp claws ruthlessly raked across Luo Tian's body.

Like blades, the claws instantly pierced into Luo Tian's flesh, blood flowing down from the wounds.

"Open up!" Luo Tian roared, at this critical moment he had thrown everything into it. Two Reincarnation Immortal Bodies exploded in a burst of power, even the illusory one self-destructed. This granted Luo Tian a brief surge in strength, making him appear as if he had expanded in size.

Under the stunned gazes of onlookers, the claws that seemed to crush Luo Tian were gradually forced apart by him.

"Fall down as well!" Luo Tian seized one of Jin Zi Yang's legs with both hands, exerting all his strength to hurl Jin Zi Yang onto the arena.

"Boom..." Under the shock of the onlookers, the massive arena shattered with a thunderous crash. The surrounding barriers vanished instantly.

Chunks of stone flew out like meteors, scattering in all directions. Luo Tian and Jin Zi Yang's figures appeared within the onlookers' sight, with Luo Tian still holding Jin Zi Yang in his grasp.

"Underestimated these young men!" Fu Wenbin's face showed a faint smile. He extended his hand, as if freezing time itself. The flying debris instantly converged and slowly coalesced back together.

"Again!" Luo Tian roared, swinging Jin Zi Yang's massive body again and hurling it onto the recovering arena.

"Ah..." Jin Zi Yang had been thrown into disarray earlier. As he just regained consciousness, he was once again brutally hurled onto the arena.

Luo Tian gave him no chance to recover, swinging his massive body repeatedly and smashing it onto the newly formed solid arena.

The thunderous explosions and flying flesh, golden feathers continuously circled around Luo Tian before scattering outward.

"Too fierce! The mighty Jin Zi Yang is being tossed about like this!" People's mouths twitched as they watched Luo Tian relentlessly tossing Jin Zi Yang, their hearts trembling.

Though Jin Zi Yang was powerful, after being tossed several times he had completely lost his ability to resist, appearing like a dead dog.

"Supreme Commander! Glorious!" The Star Moon Guards shouted loudly, eyes filled with fanaticism as they watched the awe-inspiring Luo Tian.

"I said you wouldn't disappoint me!" Fu Xingxuan's purple eyes turned into a crescent moon, she spoke softly.

"Sigh..." Fu Xingyue watched the divine light in Fu Xingxuan's eyes, letting out a long sigh. A bitter expression flickered briefly in her gaze.

"Stop!" Seeing Jin Zi Yang barely drawing breath, his remaining nine brothers could no longer bear it. One by one they soared onto the arena with overwhelming aura.

"Are you going to fight together?" Luo Tian caught his breath, scanning the group with intense battle spirit in his eyes.

"The second eldest of the Ten Princes wore a deep expression, addressing Luo Tian. He transformed into a golden lightning bolt and launched an attack towards Luo Tian.

The other eight also dispersed, surrounding Luo Tian with cold glares. Especially when they saw Luo Tian holding Jin Zi Yang's bloodied body, their killing intent surged.

"Again! Killing intent!" Luo Tian felt exasperated. These prodigies all had killing intent towards him, and he had忍ed repeatedly but gained nothing.

"Don't push me! If you provoke me further, I'll let your blood stain Star Moon Divine City!" Luo Tian spoke lowly, his own killing intent now fully ignited by these people.

"Kid, fight with all your might. If anything happens, we'll take responsibility for you!" Just as Luo Tian's words finished, Fu Wenbin's voice echoed in his mind. This made Luo Tian pause momentarily.

"Haha, you really think you've hidden well? Do you take us for fools! We're not stupid. The蛮族's Maan Qi, over the years only one person has learned it - that was the human who forced Seven Star Island to subdue the蛮魂!" Fu Wenbin didn't wait for Luo Tian's response, his voice continued echoing in Luo Tian's mind.

"We'll save you, it's a karmic connection. But you must show us whether you're worth it!"

"If you die, then you die. However, if you win, we'll save you once - only once. And as long as you're within Star Moon Divine City, no one will be able to harm you!" Fu Wenbin didn't give Luo Tian any time to think, his voice kept coming.

"Old fox!" Luo Tian sighed internally. He hadn't expected to finally be exposed, and even more so by these old schemers.

Luo Tian had experienced countless storms; he understood Fu Wenbin's meaning perfectly. Just like Fu Xingyue, it was to keep him always as a Star Moon Divine Clan member.

Luo Tian's guess was correct. Fu Wenbin valued Luo Tian's talent. From Luo Tian's performance today, he was truly invincible. None of the young generation in the Origin Domain could match him. Such a person would be unstoppable in the future, even if he couldn't attain enlightenment, it would ensure Star Moon Divine Clan's longevity.

"Saving once is enough!" Luo Tian muttered to himself, his gaze turning to Fu Xingxuan. "Little girl, I really did wrong to offend you all, always being schemed by you. When I reach the peak of my era, I'll subdue all of you!" Luo Tian felt extremely frustrated.

Being caught in Luo Tian's gaze, Fu Xingxuan seemed to sense the resentment in his eyes. A hint of apology flashed across her, but she soon stuck out her tongue at Luo Tian.

While Luo Tian was lost in thought, the nine princes of the Golden Crow clan's attacks instantly reached his front, bringing Luo Tian's mind back to the arena.

Nine flames formed nine long dragons, controlled by the nine men as they rushed toward Luo Tian. A smile appeared on Luo Tian's face.

"He's smiling!" Seeing Luo Tian's smile, the nine men felt a sudden chill in their hearts. For some reason, they felt an ominous premonition.

But soon after, the nine men's faces turned grim. Watching Luo Tian's actions, they almost spat out blood.

In view, Luo Tian swung Jin Zi Yang's massive body again and smashed it toward the nine fire dragons.

"Using Jin Zi Yang as a weapon!" Others also gasped, surprised that Luo Tian had come up with such a method to deal with the situation.

"Despicable!" The nine men immediately showed anger, shouting loudly.

"Haha, despicable? You nine ganged up on me, and now you call me despicable? I think it's not you who are despicable but stupid!" Luo Tian fought boldly, using Jin Zi Yang's flesh to smash the nine fiery dragons.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, the nine men's faces turned red and pale alternately, then became grim.

"Haha, old golden crow, your ten descendants aren't very good," Maan Qi of the蛮族 said with a smile, not missing the chance to mock the old golden crow.

"Hmph. If he wins, it's fine. After all, together they are the strongest!" The old golden crow wore an indifferent expression, showing no shame at being ganged up on.

"Brave. Let go of our elder brother, we'll fight you one by one!" The second eldest of the golden crow clan finally spoke, his gaze turning to Luo Tian.

"Don't need to. Today I'll fight ten of you! Come on then!" Luo Tian coldly snorted, waving his hand to casually toss Jin Zi Yang toward the nine men.

"What!" Hearing Luo Tian's words, the entire Star Moon Divine City seemed to fall silent for a moment. Everyone had expressions of disbelief, watching the standing Luo Tian and took a deep breath.

"Brave!" The first reaction of people was bravery. Never before had anyone dared to speak like this to the ten princes of the golden crow. To fight ten alone, such an undefeated belief was not something ordinary people could have.

"Boom..." Jin Zi Yang, who had been unconscious, fell in front of the nine men, in a pitiful state. His whole body was blackened and severely injured.

"Cough... cough..." Under the treatment of the nine men, Jin Zi Yang slowly regained consciousness and stood up. Though he had seemed unconscious earlier, his mind was still alert.

Chapter 1338: One Step, One Golden Crow

"Single-handedly fighting the ten princes of the golden crow!" People looked at Luo Tian standing among the nine men with expressions of disbelief. The first feeling was arrogance.

One Jin Zi Yang had already been a challenge for Luo Tian, let alone ten of them - four early era prodigies.

"Fu Mengchen? Arrogant!" Jin Zi Yang trembled as he stood up, gazing at Luo Tian with an expression of defiance.

"Whether it's arrogant or not is not for you to decide! Come on!" Luo Tian smiled, his body surrounded by black energy. His blood and qi surged powerfully as he swept his eyes over the ten men, his gaze filled with battle spirit and confidence.

"Good. We'll grant you that!" Jin Zi Yang spoke slowly, connecting with his brothers mentally and surrounding Luo Tian.

"Kill!" Though Jin Zi Yang had suffered heavy injuries, his strength had dropped significantly. However, with nine brothers by his side, he was confident in making Luo Tian suffer a crushing defeat.

As the nine men rushed toward Luo Tian, Luo Tian's body suddenly soared into the air. His Reincarnation Immortal Body rapidly rotated within him.

"Crush him directly!" Jin Zi Yang shouted, addressing his nine brothers. His body soared into the air, and he launched a series of golden light towards the sky, which eventually converged together.

A humming sound rang out. A massive Three-Feet Golden Crow's phantom formed under the combined efforts of the ten men. Golden flames surrounded the golden crow phantom, eventually solidifying into a sun-like blaze that pressed down on Luo Tian.

Overwhelming pressure instantly enveloped Luo Tian, making his heart tremble. He felt the terror of the sun above and black demonic energy surged upwards, hands raised to desperately intercept that terrifying blaze.

"Epoch Power!" Luo Tian felt alarmed. He saw the golden light flowing within the sun, his eyes becoming even more serious.

"Indeed, it contains a thread of Epoch Power!" Fu Xingyue and others showed serious expressions. They hadn't expected the combined effort of ten men to be so terrifying.

Tremendous waves of energy instantly swept over Luo Tian's body, making his body slightly sink.

"Boom..." The next moment, the massive sun instantly descended upon Luo Tian's body, bringing his body down with a thunderous crash.

Dust surged, hot waves of energy blew against the bodies of Jin Zi Yang's ten men, making their faces show a hint of contempt.

"Such ability, yet you dare to fight us ten alone! Even an early epoch power holder wouldn't do that. Who gave you the courage to be so arrogant?" Jin Zi Yang spoke softly, relieved that Luo Tian hadn't died yet.

"Epoch Power? What good is it!" A light laugh echoed. Black demonic energy surged, a dark light burst out from the scattered dust and appeared in people's sight.

"Cough... cough..." Luo Tian was completely blackened, his body covered with terrifying wounds. Obviously, that blow had affected him badly.

"Now it's my turn!" Luo Tian ignored the shock of everyone, his cold voice like a demon's chant. He lifted his leg and took a step forward.

"Barbarian God's Wrath, Trampling Nine Heavens!" Like a mountain of demons, the black foot suddenly descended upon the fourth prince among the ten men. It seemed to carry Luo Tian's anger, able to subdue nine heavens and ten earths.

"What is that martial art!" People immediately felt shocked, widening their eyes as they watched the black foot.

"Boom..." In people's exclamations, the black foot landed on the fourth prince of the golden crow clan.

Blood mist scattered. Even Maan Qi, who was in the late epoch, would have felt his arms numb after being震 by Luo Tian's Barbarian Seven Steps. He had suffered some injuries. The fourth prince, who was weaker than Jin Zi Yang, couldn't withstand it and turned into a mist of blood on the arena.

In people's surprise, Luo Tian's second step also crashed down, directly targeting the third prince of the golden crow clan. The Barbarian God's Second Step Shattered Stars.

"Boom..." No surprise, the third prince of the golden crow clan also turned into a mist of blood.

The Third Step of the Barbarian God Shocked Gods, and the third step crashed down on the second prince of the golden crow clan. Another mist of blood rose.

"Your turn now! Barbarian God's Fourth Step, All Gods Retreat!" Luo Tian spoke proudly. The fourth step directly aimed at Jin Zi Yang.

The thunderous sound was overwhelming. The golden crow clan's prodigy, Jin Zi Yang, also turned into a mist of blood floating around the black foot.

Originally, Jin Zi Yang's strength could have withstood Luo Tian's fourth step. However, due to his severe injuries earlier, he only had three-quarters of his peak strength. He couldn't withstand Luo Tian's fourth step enhanced by two great techniques.

"Barbarian God's Fifth Step, Shaking the World!" Luo Tian spoke softly. The fifth step fell, and with a thunderous sound, it pressed down on the six half-epoch golden crow princes.

Blood mist continuously rose. The entire arena collapsed, filled with golden crow blood, making people shocked.

The entire Star Moon Divine City fell silent. People looked at the shocking bloodstains on the arena and the demonic flames blazing in the sky above Luo Tian, remaining speechless for a long time.

"Five steps down, the ten princes of the golden crow were all turned into blood mist. Such a terrifying achievement - if not seen with one's own eyes, no one would believe it!"

One step, one golden crow. Luo Tian finally revealed his terrifying strength to the ancient myriad races for the first time.

"This Barbarian Seven Steps was tailor-made for me!" Luo Tian's eyes showed a hint of smile, feeling his own strength.

"Barbarian Seven Steps!" Pan Jingyu and Maan Qi spoke in shock, looking at Luo Tian in the sky. The two finally realized why they felt so familiar with him.

"Old barbarian, you actually gave the Barbarian Seven Steps to a Star Moon Divine Clan member?" The old golden crow's eyes held mockery as he looked at Maan Qi.

"Only one person outside the barbarian clan can master the Barbarian Seven Steps!" The old Maan Qi didn't continue speaking but turned his gaze to Fu Wenbin.

"This... this kid is definitely secured!" Fu Wenzhi showed a satisfied expression, nodding slightly. He then exchanged glances with Maan Qi.

At this moment, Luo Tian was too dazzling. Such an astonishing achievement was only seen in the young kings of the royal families.

"Glory!" The people of Star Moon Divine Clan shouted passionately, their eyes filled with fanaticism. It was even more terrifying than when Fu Xingxuan became the divine emperor, their shouts shaking the heavens.

"Buzz..." Waves spread out. A group of blood凝聚ed together, Jin Zi Yang and his ten brothers, pale-faced,凝聚ed back. Their eyes looked at Luo Tian in the sky.

They had completely lost face today. Their ten brothers, who were always invincible, were crushed step by step by someone, making them feel uncomfortable and even wanting to commit suicide.

"We haven't lost yet. We still have one move!" Jin Zi Yang shouted loudly, his voice filled with madness.

"Yes! We still have our life essence fire!" The other nine also shouted loudly. This was the first time they had encountered such a disgrace.

The ten men exchanged glances, their bodies rising with ferocity. They surrounded Luo Tian in the sky again, faces filled with hostility. Their bodies suddenly expanded, transforming into their true forms and instantly filling the entire sky.

Ten golden fire dragons spewed from the mouths of the ten golden crows. At the same time, ten blood-colored dragons followed closely, merging into the golden flames.

"Boom..." The terrifying temperature instantly burned through the sky. An endless sea of fire surrounded Luo Tian, the extreme heat making Luo Tian's face instantly grim.

"Damn it!" As the flames enveloped his body, Luo Tian's face turned grim instantly.

Luo Tian felt a terrifying temperature instantly seeping into his body through every pore.

"Get out!" Luo Tian quickly activated his Reincarnation Immortal Body and used epoch power to resist the terrifying temperature.

"It's no use. This is our life essence fire, nothing can burn!" Jin Zi Yang and others saw Luo Tian's mistake of not avoiding and spoke coldly, their voices filled with mockery and satisfaction.

"Ah..." White smoke instantly rose from Luo Tian's body. Even Luo Tian, with his strong will, felt extreme pain and couldn't bear it.

"What..." The people around were stunned. They watched the previously awe-inspiring Luo Tian turn into such a pitiful state, finding it hard to adjust.

"He's done!" Fu Xingyue watched Luo Tian in the fire, sighing inwardly. He knew Luo Tian was done, completely and utterly.

"Dead is dead! Who cares if he's human!" Tu Yangfei, Pan Jingyu, and Maan Qi sighed slightly.

"How could this be!" Fu Xingxuan's eyes showed worry. She knew the terrifying nature of the golden crow clan's life essence fire, especially when fused with their blood. No one could withstand it.

Regret filled Fu Xingxuan at this moment. She regretted not letting Luo Tian help her out. Thinking of that, Fu Xingxuan knew only a few epoch peak powers could save Luo Tian. She quickly showed a begging expression and spoke to Fu Wenbin.

But just as she opened her mouth, Fu Xingyue stopped her with a slight shake of his head. Fu Xingyue knew Fu Wenbin would not save Luo Tian.

"Ha ha, kid, how's it feeling? Is it uncomfortable?" Ten golden crows bathed in golden flames spoke mockingly.

"Quickly beg for mercy, we can withdraw the fire!" Jin Zi Yang addressed Luo Tian struggling in the flames.

"Ha ha, if I'm not mistaken, your current state is also barely holding on!" Luo Tian's eyes turned blood-red. His entire body even gave off a meaty aroma as he looked at the golden crows Jin Zi Yang.

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Jin Zi Yang and his ten men's golden eyes slowly narrowed. However, they soon laughed: "So what? Can you still turn the tide now?"

"Then let's see who can endure the fire!" Luo Tian roared, forcing back the raging fire dragons within his body. He waved his hands, and light flashed, as if stars rose.

Chapter 1339: Every Grass and Tree Becomes an Army

"Kid, don't resist. Unless you're in the late epoch, even those in the middle epoch can't withstand our life essence fire! Don't let a moment's impulse cost your life!" Jin Zi Yang lightly flapped his wings, his voice filled with satisfaction. He had finally regained some face.

Luo Tian, however, seemed not to hear Jin Zi Yang's words. He endured the burning epoch power within his body and continuously waved his hands, sending out beams of light that looked like stars.

"What is he doing?" People's faces showed confusion as they watched Luo Tian, who looked seriously determined. They didn't know how Luo Tian could possibly turn the tide at this point.

Even several epoch peak powers showed interested expressions, wondering what Luo Tian would do next.

"About enough!" Luo Tian looked at the stars floating beside him, his eyes showing a fierce expression.

Luo Tian pressed his hands together in a gesture. The last Reincarnation Immortal Body within his dantian suddenly exploded, dispersing into his dantian.

The thunderous sound echoed. With the explosion of the Reincarnation Immortal Body, a furious epoch power instantly burst out from Luo Tian's body. In an instant, it enveloped the entire arena.

"It's no use. Epoch power can burn too!" Jin Zi Yang coldly spoke, his voice filled with more contempt.

"Everything is born from the earth! Grass and trees become an army!" Luo Tian roared, his hands moving as he pressed down into the void.

"Boom..." The thunderous sound echoed. Next, the stars Luo Tian had scattered earlier suddenly burst forth, spreading a dense vitality across the arena.

"This..." Then people saw a scene that shocked them. Amidst the golden fire, medicinal herbs rapidly grew.

"I see! He scattered medicinal herb seeds earlier!" Fu Tianba's eyes sparkled, instantly understanding his actions. His expression showed a hint of fear.

"Ten... one hundred... ten thousand..." Medicinal herbs rapidly grew under the influence of the "Everything is born from the earth" technique. Two sacred medicinal herbs swayed in the flames, as if bathing in golden fire. The dense vitality began to suppress the terrifying flames.

Medicinal herbs seemed alive, moving within the fire and being controlled by Luo Tian to suppress the terrifying flames.

"It's no use!" Jin Zi Yang and his brothers showed a cold expression, spitting out endless blood spirit symbols into the golden flames.

Blood energy was expelled. The bodies of the ten golden crows trembled, obviously the fire's consumption was significant for them.

The terrifying golden flames surged endlessly. Medicinal herbs were instantly scattered like small boats in a storm, being swallowed and destroyed by the golden flames.

"Crush..." Seeing this situation, Luo Tian showed no surprise. A smile appeared on his face as he grabbed his hands.

"Boom... boom..." Medicinal herbs swaying in the fire suddenly exploded, their vitality surging upwards.

"Have you given up resisting?" Jin Zi Yang's face showed a hint of smile. His golden eyes were weak, waiting for Luo Tian to be completely consumed by the fire.

"I said, let's see who can endure!" Luo Tian's face showed a cold glint. His voice carried a hint of madness.

As soon as Luo Tian's words finished, the next moment thunderous sound shook the heavens. The golden flames seemed to have been fueled again, suddenly surging and increasing in power several times.

"Damn it!" Jin Zi Yang and his ten brothers instantly became terrified. They discovered that the terrifying flames, with increased power, had completely escaped their control.

Explosion! The terrifying temperature instantly spread. Destructive flames thunderously expanded, swallowing Jin Zi Yang and the ten men into the fire.

People were stunned by this scene. In their sight, terrifying golden flames filled the entire arena, even the arena and barriers were burning.

Some Star Moon Divine Clan members with low cultivation felt their internal energy ignite as well, retreating to the distance.

"Using grass and tree vitality to enhance the fire's temperature!" Fu Tianqing spoke softly, his voice filled with admiration. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to use the "Everything is born from the earth" technique like this.

"But, by doing so, the fire's terrifying degree has exceeded control. Such fire, even I would be burned to death if I were inside!" Fu Tianba spoke softly, his voice filled with strong fear.

The fire sea was overwhelming. The entire sky turned golden. The void was pierced, revealing vast stretches of stars as the golden flames continuously spread outward.

Luo Tian and the ten golden crows had already disappeared from people's sight, as if swallowed by the golden fire. One could no longer sense their lives or deaths. The flames grew stronger, and the temperature became even more terrifying.

"End it! If this continues, the consequences might be beyond our ability to stop!" Fu Wenbin's face changed. He addressed the old golden crow sitting beside him.

The old golden crow's expression also slightly changed. Before Fu Wenbin could finish speaking, the old figure appeared before the golden flames, opening his mouth to suck in.

A terrifying suction force was emitted from the old golden crow's mouth. The golden flames were absorbed into his body.

Even those in the late epoch would fear it, and one might even be destroyed. The terrifying flames were continuously absorbed into the old golden crow's body.

After a full quarter of an hour, the last spark was absorbed into his body. The old golden crow also let out a long breath.

People were shocked by the old golden crow's strength. Their eyes turned to the sky, and they all took a deep breath.

On the sky, eleven charred bodies appeared in people's sight. Ten things that looked like birds were completely charred, unable to distinguish life or death. They no longer had any of the golden crow clan's majestic appearance.

The other figure, however, continuously spat out white smoke. His entire body was also completely charred, but his eyes were wide open. His body trembled violently.

"Disperse!" The old golden crow extended his hand, grabbing Jin Zi Yang and the ten men in front of him. A series of hot breaths radiated from their bodies.

At the same time, Fu Wenbin also acted, starting to remove the fire poison from Luo Tian's body. Meanwhile, the charred things on Luo Tian's body also fell off, revealing his white skin.

Luo Tian felt a sudden chill. He quickly took out a robe and put it on, his weak eyes showing embarrassment.

"This fire is terrifying!" Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang stood in front of Fu Xingxuan, blocking her view. They spoke awkwardly.

Fu Xingxuan's face turned red for a moment. Although it was only a brief moment, Fu Xingxuan had seen Luo Tian's white body.

"Supreme Commander has won!" People watched Luo Tian standing there, trembling weakly but still maintaining his stance. They shouted loudly.

"Applause..." The sound of applause rose immediately. Star Moon Divine Clan people cheered loudly, looking at Luo Tian with reverence.

One person fighting ten princes of the golden crow and finally winning. The ten princes of the golden crow were turned into blood mist, and they had been unconscious. Such a terrifying achievement - if someone had told them before, they wouldn't have believed it. But now the truth was in front of their eyes, watching such a world-shaking battle, how could they not be excited?

"Alas... so strong!" Tu Yangfei and others showed a hint of bitterness, looking at Luo Tian standing there and sighing softly.

"Now, let's talk about this kid's identity issue," Old Sa Man said with a smile, his gaze turning to Luo Tian.

"Did my barbarian steps work well? I must say, you've mastered the Barbarian Seven Steps to its peak. Even more powerful than how our clan uses it!"

"But you've completely exposed your identity today. So what confidence do you have to escape from us old guys in the epoch peak?" Old Sa Man's face showed a smile, his invisible authority scrutinizing Luo Tian.

"An astonishing human! If not eliminated, he'll be another Jie Tian Master!" The old golden crow's eyes showed a hint of admiration, addressing Luo Tian.

Luo Tian smiled, then lightly shook his head. His gaze turned to Fu Wenbin. He knew that what came next would depend on Fu Wenbin.

"What do you mean by that?" Fu Wenbin pretended to be clueless, addressing the two men.

"He's a human. The human prodigy who forced our蛮族's soul in Seven Star Island, Luo Tian!" Pan Jingyu spoke loudly, his gaze turning to Luo Tian.

"Yes, he is that human. The only one outside our蛮族 who has mastered and practiced the Barbarian Seven Steps!" Maan Qi also spoke loudly, his voice like thunder. His eyes showed anger towards Luo Tian.

"Boom..." Pan Jingyu and Maan Qi's words seemed to ignite the people, their gazes turning to Luo Tian standing beside Fu Wenbin in the sky.

"Supreme Commander... is a human?"

"How could that be?" People couldn't believe it, not believing their supreme commander was a human.

"It's impossible!" Fu Xingxuan's face turned pale, looking at Luo Tian. Her eyes flashed with coldness towards Pan Jingyu and Maan Qi.

Fu Tianba and Fu Tianqing also showed expressions of surprise, looking at Luo Tian in disbelief. However, Fu Tianba soon recalled the results of his previous investigation. Luo Tian's past was completely blank, and he had mobilized all his forces but couldn't find anything.

"Haha, you two kids, speak with evidence. What proof do you have that our Star Moon Divine Clan's prodigy is a human? Is it jealousy?" Fu Wenbin's face was calm, his gaze turning to Maan Qi and Pan Jingyu with authority.

"Yes! The Supreme Commander's appearance is a Star Moon Divine Clan member. His bloodline shows no abnormalities at all. He's clearly a Star Moon Divine Clan member. Why do they say the Supreme Commander is human!"

"They must be jealous of the Supreme Commander's talent and strength, trying to defame him!" Star Moon Divine Clan people, seeing Fu Wenbin say this, leaned more towards Fu Wenbin. They really didn't want to believe it.

"Old Fu, non-ethnic people have evil hearts. Are you really willing to gamble on this?" Old Sa Man looked at Fu Wenbin with a subtle gaze, flying towards him.

Chapter 1340: Curse God Pill

Hearing Old Sa Man's words, Fu Wenbin slightly furrowed his brows. He looked at Luo Tian, clearly Old Sa Man's words had made him hesitate.

"He is a Star Moon Divine Clan member!" However, Fu Wenbin's face soon became determined. He looked at Old Sa Man and the old golden crow.

"Old Fu, you trust him, but we don't!" The old golden crow spoke strongly, gazing at Luo Tian. He opened his mouth and spat out a spark of fire.

The spark was like a firefly's light, but it was overwhelmingly strong. Its power terrified the sky, even more so than the previous massive fire. Luo Tian was certain that if this spark touched him, it would be enough to crush him.

"Golden Crow Clan's actions are arrogant and domineering. They just had a conversation with the attendants, but now they want to crush the Supreme Commander!" People watched the overwhelming spark of fire and showed shock.

"Kill him!" Qi Zi Yang's face was dark as he looked at the pale Luo Tian, his heart constantly shouting.

"Haha, I didn't expect you to be a human. You've chosen death yourself. Just this one reason, you are definitely doomed. Even if protected by the attendants, other royal clans won't let you go!" Fu Yunpeng stood among the crowd. He was the only one in the Star Moon Divine Clan whose eyes showed a sinister expression.

"Old golden crow, I said he is my Star Moon Divine Clan member. He is my Star Moon Divine Clan member!" Before the spark reached Luo Tian, Fu Wenbin's old body stood in front of Luo Tian. He extended his hand and grabbed the spark.

"Zhi..." White smoke spread from Fu Wenbin's hands. At the same time, Fu Wenbin's hand slightly trembled, his eyes showing a hint of seriousness.

"Old Fu, we've been friends for many years. We don't want to trouble you! So, hand this kid over to me. I promise to return a Star Moon Divine Clan member to you in three months!" Old Sa Man saw the tension was getting tense. He smiled and spoke to Fu Wenbin.

"This..." Fu Wenbin's face slightly changed when he heard Old Sa Man's words. He looked at Old Sa Man, his brows furrowed again.

"If you're not confident, then let this kid take the pill!" Old Sa Man looked at Fu Wenbin and handed over a gray pill.

"Is this the Curse God Pill?" Fu Wenbin slightly furrowed his brows, showing a hint of hesitation. He then glanced at Luo Tian.

"Curse God Pill!" Luo Tian had stayed in the Star Moon Divine Clan for a long time. He understood various royal clans to some extent.

The Curse God Pill originated from the蛮族, as its name suggested. It had powerful curse power. When it took effect, although it wasn't as strong as a blood oath, it was also not much weaker.

The Curse God Pill was used by the蛮族 to subdue slaves. After taking it, one couldn't disobey the蛮族 at all. If they did, they would be devoured by powerful curse power.

"Relax, our royal clan is also reasonable. If you truly submit to the Star Moon Divine Clan, then nothing will happen. However, if you have any hidden intentions, this Curse God Pill will take effect immediately!" Old Sa Man spoke coldly, as if making his final concession.

To eat or not to eat! Luo Tian constantly thought. If he took it, from now on he would have to be careful and controlled by others. If he didn't eat it, there was a high chance that Old Golden Crow and Old Sa Man would turn hostile. Fu Wenbin might also change his mind.

"Why must I eat it!" Fu Tianqing's face was grim. He stood beside Fu Wenbin and spoke loudly.

Luo Tian was his disciple. Although his identity was suspicious now, he was still his disciple. Since Luo Tian had once knelt to him, he was Fu Tianqing's disciple. Now his disciple was being pressured, and as a master, he naturally had to speak up for his disciple.

"Smack..." But just as Fu Tianqing's words finished, a golden hand also pressed down and struck Fu Tianqing's body.

"Boom..." Fu Tianqing's figure was directly crushed to the ground, raising a large amount of dust.

"We're talking. What are you? A junior! Daring to interrupt!" The old golden crow spoke arrogantly, coldly.
