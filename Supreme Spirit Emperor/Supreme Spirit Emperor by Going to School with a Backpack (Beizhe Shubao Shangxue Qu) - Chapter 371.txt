“Hmph?” Luo Tian and Gu Tianshu exchanged a glance, their eyes filled with confusion before being overtaken by astonishment.

“Failure!” Luo Li shook his head lightly. Previously, when Gu Tianshu had taught Luo Tian, Luo Li had been eavesdropping from the void, grasping only a fragment of understanding. Now he sought to test it himself.

“Excellent!” Gu Tianshu and Luo Tian nodded, their admiration for Luo Li’s talent momentarily stunned. Eavesdropping from the void had yielded such results—had Gu Tianshu truly taught him, Luo Li would have mastered it effortlessly.

“Let nature take its course. For now, you still need refinement. Once you enter the Epoch Realm, I shall teach you further.” Gu Tianshu patted Luo Li’s head, his gaze soft with affection. He surveyed his juniors, each a raw gem awaiting polishing—future achievements would be boundless.

“Little Zixi, you truly are a prodigy. How can I, your elder brother, maintain my dignity?” Gu Tianyu clasped Luo Li in an embrace, then struck his shoulder with a fist.

“We lack your talent, but we shall strive harder,” Dong Yichen and Zimu affirmed, their expressions resolute.

“Grand Elder Gu, in this epoch, do you have a chance to Achieve Dao?” Luo Tian ignored his juniors’ thoughts. He waved a hand, erecting a barrier before them, then voiced his question.

“Achieving Dao?” Gu Tianshu’s body quivered slightly, shaking his head: “I do not know.”

“Perhaps there is a chance. Master Ji once said all may Achieve Dao—like the Sovereign of the Broken Sky, who succeeded even when the myriad races were at their peak.” Gu Tianshu shook his head again.

“Set your sights further—toward Immortality!” Gu Tianshu’s gaze met Luo Tian’s, laced with expectation.

“Immortality!” Luo Tian fell silent at Gu Tianshu’s words. Since antiquity, even the kings of the Royal Clans and the Epoch Sovereigns of Humanity had never confirmed if they had attained Immortality. The Nine Domains and the Origin Domain had never glimpsed an immortal’s presence.

“Do not regard Immortality as distant and intangible—man’s will shapes fate!” Gu Tianshu spoke again, leaving Luo Tian speechless. He recalled the Burial Coffin of the Immortal, which had left him with the feeling that an immortal truly lay within.

Once a disciple of the Five Elements Sect, Luo Tian had never imagined he would become one of the Nine Domains’ greatest.

“Master Ji, Master Dongbo, and our three—Master Ji has lived the longest, thus witnessed the most. He once said he had seen a corpse of an immortal; merely glimpsing it had left him trembling in awe.” Gu Tianshu’s gaze carried reverence as he addressed Luo Tian.

“To Achieve Immortality, one must defy Heaven itself!” Before Luo Tian could react, Gu Tianshu spoke again. His aura turned icy, his eyes burning with hatred, his voice ethereal.

Chapter 1482: Misunderstanding ()

“To Achieve Immortality, one must defy Heaven itself!” Luo Tian’s heart trembled. He gazed at the distant stars, a weighty sorrow settling within him.

“Indeed,” Gu Tianshu replied softly. He recalled the era when Heaven had suppressed him, his darkest days. Had he not risen from ruin to birth a second epoch, he might have already vanished into oblivion.

Luo Tian gazed at Gu Tianshu, sensing the trials he had endured. All stemmed from that enigmatic Heaven.

Luo Tian too had once been suppressed by Heaven, understanding its torment. Had it not been for an opportunity, he might have succumbed like Gu Tianshu once did.

“As to this Heaven, it may refer to the sky itself—or perhaps Heaven’s will. I still do not grasp its meaning,” Gu Tianshu shook his head gently.

“Live in the present. Perhaps when you ascend as an Epoch Sovereign, you shall glimpse worlds we cannot see.” Gu Tianshu sighed softly.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian had not considered so far. For now, the Ancient Race still pressed Humanity heavily; no matter what, he must strive to grow strong, subduing foes and protecting his companions from harm.

“Carve your own path! If this journey were not so perilous, I would not have withheld teachings from you,” Gu Tianshu gazed deeply at Luo Tian.

“Your path!” Hearing Gu Tianshu’s words, Luo Tian’s body quivered slightly before his mind darkened with doubt.

Luo Tian fell silent again, reflecting on his journey. Though he surpassed peers and sometimes fought beyond his rank, each strength had been another’s—Fang Tian’s attack from Gu Tianshu, Man Qi’s steps from the Beast Race, Seven Demon Blades from the Demon Race.

Compare to Epoch Sovereigns: the Reincarnation Emperor forged the Cycle of Heaven, the Beast Race’s Beast God created Man Qi’s steps… The Ant Dragon Race’s Epoch Sovereign birthed the Feathered Immortality Scripture.

“Thus, one must have their own path. Others’ are not yours—do not let others’ influence your own. Achieving Dao means forging your own!” Gu Tianshu discerned Luo Tian’s doubt and spoke softly.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian nodded firmly, realizing his greatest flaw—and that of prodigies: none had ever created something uniquely their own.

“Go,” Gu Tianshu addressed Luo Tian, “all I needed to say is said. Trust me with your family.”

Luo Tian bowed respectfully to Gu Tianshu, then surveyed his juniors: “All of you must heed Grand Elder Gu’s words!”

“Rest easy, uncle-in-law. Do you not trust me?” Gu Tianyu grinned.

*Crack!*

“You’re the most troublemaking kid. Who did you inherit that from?” Luo Tian, seeing Gu Tianyu, felt a headache. He shook his head and vanished into the stars.

Flying unburdened, Luo Tian knew with Gu Tianshu’s presence, no force could breach the Four Sacred Star Domains unless all Ancient Kings united to attack them.

Three days later, Luo Tian reached the domain’s edge, his face etched with admiration. The Nether Domain was now fully controlled by the Ancient Race; its depths remained obscured.

He retrieved the Mirage Mask, concealing his aura as he circled the Nether Domain, his presence now mimicking that of the Star Moon Clan.

After half an hour, Luo Tian finally found the Nether Domain’s entrance, spotting two familiar figures. A smile tugged at his lips.

The two were from the Four Sacred Star Domains, their cultivation at the Epoch’s initial stage—Luo Tian knew them well. One was Feng Qianyu, his old comrade from the Five Elements Sect; the other was Dong Sansi. Both eyed the two Epoch-level Ancient Kings with caution.

Opposite them stood the Star Moon Clan’s Grand Commander, Kou Tiande, and Deputy Commander Fu Zhiming—Luo Tian’s old acquaintances.

“Who?” Luo Tian’s arrival made Feng Qianyu and Dong Sansi wary, their gazes shifting upon recognizing his Star Moon Clan guise.

“Ancient Kings dare enter the Four Sacred Star Domains—death!” Dong Sansi’s black blade flashed, a thunderous slash aimed at Luo Tian.

“Truly…” Luo Tian gazed at Dong Sansi’s blade, speechless yet concealing his identity.

“Kill…” Luo Tian coldly exhaled, a fist striking the blade’s path. The slash shattered, and he surged toward Fu Zhiming and Kou Tiande.

“Who are you?” Kou Tiande and Fu Zhiming remained vigilant, suspecting Luo Tian’s presence. The Star Moon Clan had withdrawn from the Thunder Domain; this sudden appearance defied logic.

Both veterans, they would not let him in without verification. Though his form and aura matched the Star Moon Clan, they needed to confirm—should he be a human infiltrator, they could not allow entry into the Nether Domain.

The precedent of Luo Tian’s past infiltration lingered in their minds.

They conjured radiant moons and stars, pressing down upon Luo Tian.

“Roar…” A crimson dragon erupted from Feng Qianyu’s hands, its savage aura lunging toward Luo Tian.

Dong Sansi delivered a second slash, its might even more overwhelming, cleaving toward Luo Tian.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian grimaced at the four attacking him, then his body trembled as a radiant light enveloped him.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed around Luo Tian, who could not retaliate—four opponents he knew well.

Though unharmed, his body was battered as he stood amidst them.

“It’s me!” A voice echoed in their minds, causing the four to freeze, eyes wide with disbelief.

Dong Sansi and Feng Qianyu recognized the voice instantly, their gazes filled with doubt.

Kou Tiande and Fu Zhiming too bore confusion, the voice familiar yet unconnected to Luo Tian.

“Continue attacking me!” Luo Tian frowned, sensing powerful auras approaching from the Nether Domain’s entrance. He transmitted to Feng Qianyu and Dong Sansi.

“Boom…” Dong Sansi and Feng Qianyu obeyed without hesitation, unleashing two overwhelming martial arts toward Luo Tian.

“Pf!” Next moment, Luo Tian spun around, his back struck by their techniques. His back exposed, blood seeped from torn robes as he spat blood, using the force to propel himself toward Kou Tiande and Fu Zhiming.

Kou Tiande and Fu Zhiming, witnessing Luo Tian’s battered state, did not strike. He appeared as a Star Moon Clan member, and their ears still recalled his voice—seeming to wish to return to the Ancient Kings.

“Who are you?” Kou Tiande and Fu Zhiming caught Luo Tian, their expressions puzzled. Such strength would not go unnoticed in the Star Moon Clan.

“Return him! Have you forgotten the pact between our Ancient Kings and Human Elders? The Ancient Races must not enter other star domains. If they do, they shall be annihilated!” Feng Qianyu’s eyes glowed red as he addressed Kou Tiande and Fu Zhiming, his voice cold.

“Clever!” Luo Tian inwardly praised Feng Qianyu; he had guessed his intent.

Feng Qianyu’s words made Dong Sansi pause, but he did not object, standing before Feng Qianyu with his black blade, eyes coldly watching Kou Tiande and Fu Zhiming.

Kou Tiande and Fu Zhiming too were surprised; Feng Qianyu’s words made sense. Yet, if they handed Luo Tian over, they felt reluctant.

If they did not, and something happened, they could not bear responsibility—this was a pact between the Ancient Kings’ Grand Elders and Human Elders. They were merely guarding the Nether Domain’s entrance, preventing human infiltrators.

“Which eye saw him enter Humanity?” As Kou Tiande hesitated, a mocking voice echoed from the Nether Domain. Several powerful figures emerged, their gazes scanning Luo Tian.

“Respect the Commander!” Kou Tiande and Fu Zhiming sighed in relief, bowing to two of the newcomers.

“Indeed them!” Luo Tian was surprised at their arrival.

“Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingyang—your Star Moon Clan truly seeks trouble. How dare you appear at such a sensitive time in Humanity!” A disdainful voice echoed.

Feng Qianyu and Dong Sansi’s faces darkened, retrieving a token. Though they knew Luo Tian could easily defeat these Ancient Kings’ prodigies, they still played the part.

Chapter 1483: Re-entering Star Moon ()

“Which eye saw him enter Humanity? He is now with us!” Fu Xingyue smiled, gazing at Feng Qianyu and Dong Sansi.

“Also, do not think your alliance with the myriad races allows you to boss us around!” Fu Xingyang sneered, addressing others.

Accompanying Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang were Tu Feiyang and Fan Jingyu, who had recovered.

“Must we summon Humanity’s elders?” Dong Sansi and Feng Qianyu’s faces darkened, clenching their tokens.

“Do not be so tense! Let us question him first!” Fu Xingyue smiled, turning to Luo Tian.

“Speak—how did you appear here?” Fu Xingyue spoke softly, scanning Luo Tian with authority.

“Commander, you heard it—this is a misunderstanding. Please let them pass!” Fu Xingyue smiled, approaching Feng Qianyu and Dong Sansi. He waved a hand, sending two storage rings to their hands.

Due to Luo Tian’s presence, Fu Xingyue wished no major conflict with the Four Sacred Star Domains. His words softened.

“Hmph,” Feng Qianyu and Dong Sansi now understood Luo Tian’s intent, feigning a glance around before storing the rings.

“Only this time!” Feng Qianyu coldly spoke, scanning Luo Tian before returning to his post.

“Come with me,” Fu Xingyue smiled, leading Luo Tian into the Nether Domain.

Upon entering, Fu Xingyue stood beneath gray stars, addressing Tu Feiyang and others: “Let us discuss our matters later. I must return to the Star Moon Clan’s base.”

“Return? Fu Xingyue, do you think our time is wasted?” Jin Ziyang sneered.

“You may proceed ahead if confident!” Fu Xingyang replied, his gaze disdainful.

“Do you think we cannot enter without you? We had agreed beforehand—why change now?” Tu Feiyang questioned, scanning Luo Tian.

“Did you not see my subordinates injured? Who else but a compassionate commander would care?” Fu Xingyue spoke softly, his excuse obvious to all.

“Also, our Star Moon Clan’s affairs are none of your concern. If you have the ability, proceed ahead; if not, wait for us.” Fu Xingyue sneered, grabbing Luo Tian and flying into the Nether Domain’s depths.

Fu Xingyang, though unaware of his brother’s motives, stood by him publicly. He sneered and followed Fu Xingyue into the distance.

“Damn it…” Seeing them leave, Tu Feiyang’s group darkened.

“We’ll show you without them!” Jin Ziyang sneered, unsure why Fu Xingyue changed plans but certain it involved Luo Tian.

“Indeed! Let us go!” Tu Feiyang agreed, his confidence radiating—his belief in entering dangerous places was unshakable.

“Go!” They conferred, then flew another direction.

Beneath gray stars, Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang led Luo Tian forward. After an hour, Fu Xingyue halted, turning to place Luo Tian on the stars.

“Speak—what are you?” Fu Xingyue smiled, his aura radiating to lock Luo Tian down.

Hearing Fu Xingyue’s words, Fu Xingyang’s face shifted slightly, his aura surging to block Luo Tian’s escape.

“Commander, I truly am a Star Moon Guard!” Luo Tian was surprised but gazed at Fu Xingyue.

“Stop lying! Speak—what are you? I’ll give you one last chance to tell the truth!” Fu Xingyue waved a hand, conjuring an imitation of the Star Moon Clan’s divine spear.

“You lied earlier. I am the Star Moon Guard Commander. One hundred thousand personnel arrived in the Nine Domains; they remain one hundred thousand here. Where did you come from?”

“Also, though your aura matches the Star Moon Clan, your excuse is too flimsy. You are at the Epoch’s initial stage; our Star Moon Guard’s highest is not even a Saint Mid-stage. What opportunity allowed your rapid growth?”

“I let you in because you recognized Fu Zhiming and seemed familiar with the Star Moon Guard. If not, I would have killed you!” Fu Xingyue spoke softly.

“Truly, this one cannot be deceived!” Luo Tian shook his head, a bitter smile on his face.

“It’s me!” Luo Tian waved a hand, altering his appearance to that of Fu Mengchen from the Star Moon Clan.

“Luo…” Seeing Luo Tian’s form, Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang’s faces shifted, their minds reeling—unspoken words of “Heaven” on their lips.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian changed back in an instant, fearing someone might recognize him and cause trouble. Though the two races had a pact—Ancient Kings could not enter the Nine Domains, but no explicit rule barred Humanity from entering Nether and Thunder Domains. Yet none dared enter alone.

“You’ve come to seek death!” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang eyed the surroundings cautiously, scanning for threats. The Nether Domain now teemed with elders; though Ancient Kings and Epoch Peak figures did not emerge, their auras remained. If detected, Luo Tian would die.

“Rest easy—no one is scanning,” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang.

“I know the two races’ relations are tense, but some things I must do,” Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice resolute.

Luo Tian knew what he represented—if he perished in the Nether Domain, the Four Sacred Star Domains and Beast Race would go mad. The fragile peace would shatter.

“With a little care, nothing should be wrong. After all, I spent a long time in the Star Moon Clan,” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang.

“You…” Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang wore exasperation, watching Luo Tian’s carefree demeanor.

The Star Moon Clan now clearly favored friendship with Luo Tian, unless he killed Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang—then they would fully break.

“First, return to the Star Moon Clan’s base. Pay respects to the Grand Minister and our Prince,” Fu Xingyue gazed at Luo Tian’s resolve, a bitter smile on his face.

“Good.” Luo Tian knew he could not refuse; he wished to build relations with the Star Moon Clan, as the Ancient Races might yet attack the Nine Domains.

Fu Xingyang said nothing; he and Luo Tian had a history, but his shock at Luo Tian’s audacity—entering the Nether Domain alone—was undeniable.

The three became three streaks of light, flying toward the Star Moon Clan’s base.

The Nether Domain was now controlled by the Ancient Races, yet it remained gloomy and oppressive.

As they flew, Luo Tian sensed an unusual aura upon entering the Star Moon Clan’s occupied land—not the Nether Domain’s pressure, but a refreshing one.

“Hmph, truly worthy of the Star Moon Clan!” Luo Tian stood in the sky, gazing at the land below. Its transformation was evident—resembling the Star Moon Continent he once knew.

“This is truly to station in the Nine Domains!” Luo Tian mused, following Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang toward the land’s center.

In a blink, they landed on a mountain. Under the respectful gazes of surrounding attendants, they entered a luxurious palace.

“Announce to the Emperor: Star Yang Commander and Star Moon Commander seek an audience!” Fu Xingyue addressed a guard at the palace’s entrance.

“Star Moon Emperor?” Hearing Fu Xingyue, Luo Tian’s body tensed involuntarily. He knew who the Star Moon Emperor was—unexpectedly, Fu Xingxuan had arrived. Previously, during the races’ invasion of domains, Luo Tian hadn’t seen Fu Xingxuan’s presence; he’d assumed she was in the Origin Domain.

The Star Moon Clan’s Emperor was the one Luo Tian least wished to meet. He had once refused Fu Xingxuan’s proposal before Fu Wenbin and Fu Tianba, leaving her face slightly embarrassed.

“Hmph!” Seeing Luo Tian’s bitter smile, Fu Xingyang sneered, recalling Luo Tian’s refusal. His mind was unpleased.

Chapter 1484: Still a Commander ()

Not long after, the guard exited the palace, bowing to Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang.

“Come! It’s inevitable. First, assign you a position within the Star Moon Clan—this will ease your future endeavors,” Fu Xingyue smiled, addressing Luo Tian as he strode into the palace.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian nodded, knowing Fu Xingyue’s intent—this identity would aid him. The issue of his status naturally needed to be reported to the Star Moon Emperor.

“Respect the two Commanders!” A beautiful attendant greeted them, her gaze respectful.

“But who is this man? He seems unfamiliar,” the attendants wondered upon seeing Luo Tian behind them.

“Elder Brother, Second Elder!” As the three entered the grand hall, a fragrant breeze filled Luo Tian’s nose. A perfect face appeared before him—truly exquisite.

“Didn’t I tell you to announce? What’s this?” Fu Xingxuan smiled playfully, wrapping her imperial robe around Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang’s arms.

“Elder Brother, Second Elder!” Fu Xingyang spoke, his gaze indulgent toward Fu Xingxuan.

“Indeed!” Fu Xingxuan immediately noticed the three behind her, then straightened, releasing her grip. A regal aura radiated from her—years in power had imbued her with a sovereign’s dignity. Her sternness surprised Luo Tian.

“Who is he?” Fu Xingyue’s voice remained gentle, his demeanor unchanged before his brothers.

“He is no ordinary person!” Fu Xingyue smiled, addressing Fu Xingxuan.

“Xingxuan, when I reveal his identity, you must hold yourself together!” Fu Xingyang warned her, fearing she might lose control.

As Fu Xingxuan’s elder brother, they knew her feelings over the years. She only let down her guard before them, sharing her thoughts.

“Is he not just a subordinate? Why did you bring him to me?” Fu Xingxuan’s expression was puzzled, barely glancing at Luo Tian.

“Not just any position—this is the Star Moon Guard Commander!” Fu Xingyue spoke softly, but before he finished, Fu Xingxuan’s body trembled.

“Second Elder!” Fu Xingxuan turned abruptly, gazing at Fu Xingyue with confusion. Why would he request this position for an unrelated person?

The Star Moon Guard Commander’s post had remained vacant for years; Fu Xingxuan never allowed anyone else to hold it. Other positions were irrelevant, but this one had always been a longing for Fu Xingxuan.

Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang naturally knew her thoughts. Yet now, they had proposed this, causing Fu Xingxuan’s discontent and confusion—why would her brothers suddenly suggest this? Her gaze shifted to Luo Tian, who had not been given a proper glance.

Fu Xingxuan scrutinized the smiling Luo Tian, her body trembling as she recognized his smile.

“Who are you?” Though doubtful, she dismissed it immediately.

“It’s me!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice that of Fu Mengchen. He sighed deeply.

“Boom…” Fu Xingxuan’s body swayed violently, her eyes filled with disbelief. No longer the cold Star Moon Emperor of years past.

Fu Xingxuan’s purple eyes brimmed with shock—this voice, she could not recognize. Yet Fu Xingxuan never imagined Luo Tian would appear here.

Fu Xingxuan, a sovereign, had been stationed in the Origin Domain since the Ancient Races and Humanity’s war ended. Fu Tianba returned to the Origin Domain, and Fu Xingxuan inexplicably came to the Nether Domain. Why? Even she did not know.

“Long time no see!” Luo Tian, seeing Fu Xingxuan’s stunned state, spoke first.

“Long time no see! How did you come here? Are you seeking death?” Fu Xingxuan’s gaze was heavy.

“No, I’ve come to join you!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing Fu Xingxuan.

“You’re incorrigible!” Fu Xingxuan scolded, then furrowed her brows.

“Speak—why risk so much to enter the Nether Domain? Perhaps we can assist you!” Fu Xingyue spoke softly, directly questioning Luo Tian. They were not fools; they knew he had no intention of visiting for nostalgia.

“I must enter the Nether Soil!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered, avoiding further words to state his purpose: one of the Nine Perilous Lands, the Nether Domain’s Nether Soil.

“Do you wish to enter the Nether Soil?” Hearing Luo Tian, Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingyang, and Fu Xingxuan’s faces shifted slightly before turning solemn.

“Indeed! My wife may be trapped in the Nether Soil—thus, I must go!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his eyes resolute.

“Coincidence! We too intended to enter the Nether Soil, but coincidentally met you. Thus, we must delay our plan. However, the Nether Soil has been restless lately—frequent cries echo, as if demons from the abyss. The surrounding races are terrified!”

“Me and Tu Feiyang plan to unite and enter the Nether Soil, discovering what transpires,” Fu Xingyue spoke, his gaze solemn—Nine Perilous Lands were no laughing matter.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed, sensing the danger. A force that unsettled the Ancient Races must be formidable—especially one that alarmed Fu Xingyue and Tu Feiyang. The commotion must be significant.

Luo Tian’s concern deepened for Gu Qianshi and Sun Mengru—should they be trapped in the Nether Soil, would they face peril?

“Then I shall accompany you!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice anxious. He could not waste time.

“Don’t rush. First, meet the Grand Minister and our Prince,” Fu Xingyue shook his head, gesturing to Luo Tian with a token.

“Fine,” Luo Tian gazed at Fu Xingyue’s token, its waves pulsating. He wore a bitter smile before nodding.

“Empress, I shall take him for now. Let him serve as Star Moon Guard Commander—though his appearance must not revert to the original. We shall proceed together into the Nether Soil after he meets the Grand Minister and Prince.” Fu Xingyue addressed Fu Xingxuan.

“Hmph, Second Elder—handle it as you wish,” Fu Xingxuan nodded. Though she had much to say, she could not voice it—Luo Tian’s words of seeking his wife lingered.

“He came to find his wife!” Fu Xingxuan’s heart ached, sighing deeply without further words.

“Come,” seeing Fu Xingxuan’s state, Fu Xingyang glared at Luo Tian before dragging him toward the palace.

“Brother, I’m not saying this to mock you—men have multiple wives naturally. Look at me; I have so many wives, why burden yourself? You only have a few!” Fu Xingyue’s gaze held encouragement.

“People are different,” Luo Tian shook his head. At his status, marrying a hundred wives was feasible—but he would not. Not only would Gu Qianshi and others object, but himself too.

“Stubborn fool!” Fu Xingyang sneered, disapproving of Luo Tian’s actions. His sister was so noble—yet she seemed to be giving in, but he refused. The thought made Fu Xingyang want to vomit.

“Go,” Fu Xingyue addressed Fu Xingyang, “I’ll notify you when we enter the Nether Soil.”

“Hmph,” Fu Xingyang glared at Luo Tian again before heading to his quarters.

“Go, but you cannot reveal your true identity. If exposed, the Star Moon Guard might go mad. You don’t know how they reacted when you were in that state!” Fu Xingyue smiled.

The Ancient Kings valued strength, and Luo Tian had once been their commander. The Star Moon Guard was not foolish; they could guess his identity.

“These people are fine, but they killed many of us!” Luo Tian smiled as he followed Fu Xingyue into the Star Moon Guard’s training ground. The Star Moon Guard still guarded their clan, so half remained—some trained, others lounged.

“What are you doing?” Fu Xingyue sneered, ascending the platform. His voice echoed over the training ground.

Chapter 1485: Disobedient? ()

“Ah…” Upon Fu Xingyue’s words, Star Moon Guards stood up instantly. In three breaths, they formed a line, eyes respectful toward Fu Xingyue.

Yet, they noticed Fu Xingyue’s side—Luo Tian. Their gazes held confusion; they had never seen this man before.

“Hmph, the Star Moon Guard is truly more disciplined!” Luo Tian smiled at the sudden formation of Star Moon Guards, recognizing many familiar faces.

“Announce an event—this man shall now be your commander. His name is…” Fu Xingyue spoke loudly, then turned to Luo Tian, suddenly recalling he had no name.

“Gu Sansi!” Luo Tian fabricated a name, smiling at the Star Moon Guards.
