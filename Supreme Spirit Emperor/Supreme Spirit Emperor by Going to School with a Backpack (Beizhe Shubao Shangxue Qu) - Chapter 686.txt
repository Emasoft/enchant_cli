“Elder Brother, we’ve never killed anyone before!” Da Niu and Er Niu felt a flicker of fear. Though they often hunted in the Divine Stealth Village, they had never actually taken a life.

“Survival of the fittest. Treat them like pigs and dogs!” Luo Tian struck with a fist, shattering the descending thunder.

“Good!” Da Niu and Er Niu’s faces lit with a flicker of excitement, mixed with tension, as they charged toward Shen Gongtu and his five men.

As soon as the two moved, their speed surged. Like two bulls, they instantly appeared before Shen Gongtu’s group.

Da Niu raised his hand and struck a black-cloaked figure with a fist. The overwhelming aura caused the black-cloaked warrior to gasp in alarm.

Crack...

In an instant, two fists collided. The man facing Da Niu spat blood and was hurled backward.

“How is this possible?” people gasped, staring at Da Niu as if he were a monster.

Boom...

On the other side, a dull thud echoed. Er Niu shot a finger, sending a beam of divine light into a shadow’s body, piercing through its shoulder.

Luo Tian was momentarily stunned. He hadn’t expected these two seemingly simple-minded men to be so formidable in battle.

“The enemy is too strong. We should retreat!” Shen Gongtu shouted, having sent a message after Luo Tian left to summon his allies.

They had a method to elevate themselves to the Early Stage of the Immortal King. Shen Gongtu had originally believed he would achieve great success, defeating Luo Tian with five Early Stage Immortal Kings—how could that not be effortless? Yet he hadn’t anticipated Luo Tian’s companions being so powerful.

Roar...

But Shen Gongtu found escape difficult. In an instant, ten thousand souls howled, and the Reincarnation Domain descended upon them, enveloping Shen Gongtu’s group.

Howls echoed as divine souls transformed into gray sword qi, drifting through the domain. The overwhelming pressure made Shen Gongtu’s group pale.

“You think you can escape so easily?” Luo Tian chuckled. He had realized that Shen Gongtu alone was a true Early Stage Immortal King, while the others were merely elevated through a formation—no match for him.

Luo Tian stepped with the Yellow Springs Step, instantly appearing before Shen Gongtu. He clenched his fist and struck.

“Damn you!” Shen Gongtu cursed inwardly. At this moment, he couldn’t flee; Luo Tian’s domain pressed upon him like a mountain.

Yet Shen Gongtu had no choice but to defend. He raised his hand and met Luo Tian’s fist with a palm.

Flesh clashed. Among equals, Luo Tian feared no one. Moreover, he had strengthened significantly in the Ghost-Devil Marsh.

Crack...

A sharp sound echoed. Shen Gongtu’s arm was shattered by Luo Tian’s fist, vanishing before his eyes.

The other two unharmed men were also instantly pounded into the ground. Before the battle had even begun, it was over.

“Too weak!” Da Niu and Er Niu sneered, gazing at the four half-dead men. They had expected outsiders to be formidable.

“Even the big tiger in the back mountains is tougher!” The two looked down on the fallen men with disdain.

Luo Tian unleashed waves of divine laws, sealing the five. He and Da Niu and Er Niu landed before Shen Gongtu’s group.

At the same time, the formation power on Shen Gongtu’s group vanished. Their auras dropped, leaving only Shen Gongtu as an Early Stage Immortal King; the other four were merely Half-Step Immortal Kings.

“Still strong,” Luo Tian frowned, gazing at Shen Gongtu’s group. He then extended his hand, shattering their headscarves to reveal their faces.

“Speak up. Who are you? Why did you ambush me?” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at them.

Yet the five remained stubbornly silent, refusing to speak.

“You have only one chance. My patience is limited!” Seeing their determined faces, Luo Tian’s expression turned cold.

But Luo Tian received only silence. This made him impatient.

“I admire your kind!”

“Da Niu, kill one!” Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Da Niu.

“Uh…” Da Niu hesitated. He had thought they wouldn’t need to kill, but now it seemed they would.

In Da Niu and Er Niu’s minds, this was just a fight. In the Divine Stealth Village, they often fought凶兽 in the back mountains.

“Kill! If we hadn’t been stronger, it would’ve been us who died. And our situation is far worse!” Luo Tian spoke solemnly, teaching Da Niu and Er Niu.

Luo Tian allowed them to be kind, but not naive. This was a world of deceit and betrayal. He couldn’t always stay with them, so they had to survive. Though their strength was formidable, it wouldn’t save them from being outwitted.

“Alright, you’ll have to do this eventually. Da Niu, as the elder brother, you go first!” Luo Tian addressed Da Niu.

“Okay…” Da Niu gritted his teeth, stepping toward a Half-Step Immortal King and staring at him.

“Don’t come crying to me after you die! Who asked you to try to kill me!” Da Niu muttered, then raised his fist and struck the Half-Step Immortal King.

Boom…

Even an Early Stage Immortal King couldn’t withstand Da Niu’s attack. How much less a Half-Step one? The man was instantly shattered into blood mist, scattering across the ground.

Da Niu’s face turned red. He immediately spun around, muttering: “He’s a beast. He’s a beast!”

“Now will you talk?” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Shen Gongtu’s group. His smile made them shudder.

“I’ll speak…” a Half-Step Immortal King shouted, drawing Luo Tian’s attention.

Boom…

But before the man could finish speaking, his body exploded into a mist of blood, vanishing from Luo Tian’s group’s sight.

“Blood Oath!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, gazing at Shen Gongtu’s group. No need to guess—they had all sworn a blood oath.

“Er Niu, it’s your turn!” Luo Tian addressed Er Niu, who hesitated, glancing at Da Niu still muttering.

“Just slaughter livestock!” Er Niu gritted his teeth, stepping toward a Half-Step Immortal King and slapping him.

Another mist of blood rose. Er Niu’s face was red, but he fared better than Da Niu.

“Enough. Let them catch their breath,” Luo Tian extended his hand, lifting Shen Gongtu and the remaining two. He wouldn’t let them continue killing—some things required gradual steps.

“Back to the Reincarnation Palace!” Luo Tian led them into the sky, heading toward the Reincarnation Palace. He urgently needed to know what was happening: had Fu Xingxuan been taken out by Mo Tian? What were Shen Gongtu’s group up to? What about the Huangtian Palace Master? How was the attack on the Immortal Realm proceeding?

The three flew into the sky. Da Niu and Er Niu’s faces were red, but as natives of the Divine Stealth Village, they felt some discomfort yet no major harm. Their speed was astonishing.

Along the way, Luo Tian observed the Underworld’s state. The most obvious change was that the Underworld’s people had dwindled, even seeing many empty cities.

After seven days of flight, Luo Tian and his companions finally returned to the Reincarnation Palace, their faces showing admiration.

“Senior Disciple!” Upon arriving at the Reincarnation Palace, the guards’ faces lit with joy and disbelief.

Luo Tian had been missing for eight years. No one knew where he had gone until the Holy Maiden Fu Xingxuan returned, revealing he had gone to the Ghost-Devil Marsh.

“Luo Tian! You’re back!” In an instant, the news of Luo Tian’s return spread throughout the Reincarnation Palace.

A multitude of figures instantly flew out, eyes filled with excitement as they gazed at Luo Tian. Luo Tian’s own expression showed excitement—eight years had passed since he last returned to the Reincarnation Palace.

“Boy, you’ve finally come back. Hurry up—Master wants to see you!” Jueying Tianzun smiled, gazing at Luo Tian.

Chapter 2563: Situation()

In the grand hall of the Reincarnation Palace, Hei Bai Wu Chang sat there, gazing at Luo Tian standing before them.

“Boy, I didn’t think you could escape on your own. I thought I’d have to go myself!” Hei Bai Wu Chang smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

“Master, you knew I was trapped?” Luo Tian’s eyes brightened, gazing at Hei Bai Wu Chang.

His last message had been within Xingtian’s space. Only Mo Tian and Diaodezhu knew he was trapped. If Hei Bai Wu Chang also knew, it meant Mo Tian had visited the Reincarnation Palace.

“Of course I did!” Hei Bai Wu Chang smiled, gazing at the hall’s entrance.

“Luo Tian!” A clear voice echoed behind Luo Tian, making him tremble slightly before his body shuddered.

“Xingxuan!” Luo Tian turned abruptly, seeing Fu Xingxuan at the hall’s entrance—his long-sought Fu Xingxuan.

“Little girl!” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate, wrapping his arms around her.

“I’m sorry!” Fu Xingxuan felt Luo Tian’s excitement, her voice sweet as honey in his ear.

“Let me punish you!” Luo Tian spoke softly, only they could hear.

Luo Tian slowly released the blushing Fu Xingxuan, gazing at her carefully. He didn’t care how she had escaped—just that she had.

“Boy, enough! There are many old bachelors here!” Hei Bai Wu Chang interrupted, spoiling the mood.

“Boy, how did you escape?” Hei Bai Wu Chang looked at Luo Tian, his expression puzzled. Seeing Luo Tian still at the Early Stage of the Immortal King, he sighed deeply.

Luo Tian smiled, introducing Da Niu and Er Niu to the others. He also recounted his experiences in the Ghost-Devil Marsh.

“Indeed! I didn’t expect such a powerful person to exist in the Ghost-Devil Marsh!” People murmured, secretly admiring Luo Tian’s luck.

“Me and Qiu Chan almost became zombies. Fortunately, Diaodezhu saved us!” Fu Xingxuan spoke with a shudder, recalling the dangers in the Ghost-Devil Marsh.

“Master, what’s happening with the Underworld?” Luo Tian waved his hand, throwing Shen Gongtu and the others out.

“What?” Hei Bai Wu Chang’s eyes flickered, but he grabbed Shen Gongtu and the others.

“Let’s discuss this later!” Hei Bai Wu Chang’s solemn voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, making him slightly alert.

“How is the attack on the Immortal Realm?” Luo Tian ignored it, shifting the topic to the battle against the Immortal Realm.

“Senior Disciple, during your eight years away, our Reincarnation Palace advanced swiftly. We’ve pushed into the Immortal Realm’s million miles. Now our territory isn’t just the Reincarnation Palace!”

“Millions of miles into the Immortal Realm are now our territory. Your master, Jianzun, is currently stationed at the front.”

“But after pushing a million miles, we met resistance. We learned it was Tianyuan Sect!” Jueying Tianzun handed Luo Tian a scroll, detailing the battles at the Ghost Gate over these eight years.

Luo Tian unrolled the scroll, frowning as he quickly scanned it. He understood.

“From what Xingxuan said, this Tianyuan Sect was your former sect. We had a tacit understanding, fighting only a few times before ceasing,” he said.

“We’ve been waiting for your return to see your opinion!”

“Over these years, other sects have suffered heavy losses. Over thirty or forty Immortal Kings have fallen!”

“They’ve pushed deep into the Immortal Realm. We can’t keep dragging our feet. If you hadn’t returned, I was about to go find you in the Ghost-Devil Marsh!” Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke.

“Hmm. I’ll go to the Front Gate tomorrow and see what to do!” Luo Tian nodded. Regarding Tianyuan Sect, he was also troubled.

“Alright, everyone, leave. I need to speak with the Senior Disciple about the Ghost-Devil Marsh!” Hei Bai Wu Chang addressed everyone, arranging for Da Niu and Er Niu before dismissing the hall.

“Boy, where did you catch these three?” Once everyone left, Hei Bai Wu Chang tossed Shen Gongtu out.

“Reincarnation Palace Master!” Shen Gongtu and the others trembled. Though they had some strength, they rarely saw Hei Bai Wu Chang. They were terrified, trembling before him.

“Ghost-Devil King City, this is the city’s master Shen Gongtu. I don’t know the other two. There were five total; I killed two!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his first time seeing Hei Bai Wu Chang so solemn.

“Five years ago, this faction quietly rose. No one knows where it came from or who its leader is.”

“At the time, we were busy with the battle against the Immortal Realm and didn’t take it seriously. But by the time we did, it had already become a force.”

“This faction is extremely hidden. Unless on a mission, they never reveal themselves. If someone speaks against them, they face retaliation!” Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke softly.

“Moreover, this faction seems to be everywhere. It’s as if every sect and position has their people!” Hei Bai Wu Chang continued without waiting for Luo Tian’s response.

“Indeed!” Luo Tian, hearing Hei Bai Wu Chang’s words, felt his heart tighten. He had suspected Shen Gongtu’s faction was powerful but hadn’t expected it to reach this level, even making Hei Bai Wu Chang wary.

“It wasn’t just a few years of growth!”

“Only after the Ghost-Devil King City was destroyed did we notice. I didn’t mention it in front of the hall because I feared there might be members among them!” Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke softly.

“How is that possible?” Luo Tian’s eyes widened in disbelief. The people who had greeted him were all high-ranking figures of the Reincarnation Palace, each crucial. If they were infiltrated, it would be extremely dangerous for the Reincarnation Palace.

“First priority is to find these people within the Reincarnation Palace. Otherwise, they’ll remain a threat!” Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke.

“Also, be careful. Shen Gongtu’s group targeted you because they seem interested in every sect’s Senior Disciple. The Equal Sect’s Senior Disciple was severely injured and barely alive!” Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke.

Luo Tian grew more solemn. The enemy had chosen the perfect timing, right when the Ten Kings of Yama were attacking the Immortal Realm and stuck.

“Those eight years seemed short, but so much has happened. Even we are overwhelmed!” Hei Bai Wu Chang sighed.

“Master, Huangtian Palace Master might also be part of this faction!” Luo Tian suddenly recalled seeing the Huangtian Palace Master in the Ghost-Devil Marsh.

“What?” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Hei Bai Wu Chang’s eyes widened in disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian.

“I did see the Huangtian Palace Master wearing clothes similar to theirs, heading toward the Ghost-Devil Marsh. I don’t know what he was doing!” Luo Tian felt fear. If even the Ten Kings of Yama were part of this faction, it would be a disaster.

“Wait for me!” Hei Bai Wu Chang’s face darkened. He took out a token, sat cross-legged, and seemed to enter meditation.

After half a bell, Hei Bai Wu Chang opened his eyes. His black and white gaze was dark.

“He’s not in the Huangtian Palace!” Hei Bai Wu Chang spoke solemnly, still disbelieving. After all, they were masters now.

“Could the Huangtian Palace Master be this faction’s leader?” Luo Tian was also puzzled. He didn’t understand why the Huangtian Palace Master had joined this faction.

“Be more careful. I feel an invisible hand pushing the Underworld, even the Immortal Realm, toward a certain direction!”

“By the way, the Equal Sect’s Senior Disciple was severely injured. So we’ve decided to boost the Senior Disciples’ strength. Do you want to join?” Hei Bai Wu Chang gazed at Luo Tian.

“I don’t need it. You know my situation. If I could have advanced to the Middle Stage of the Immortal King, I would’ve!” Luo Tian smiled bitterly. He waved his hand, but then his face darkened.

“Where’s my Rebirth Grass?” Luo Tian gasped. He didn’t know when it disappeared.

“Gone?” Hei Bai Wu Chang was also startled. He knew what Rebirth Grass meant to Luo Tian.

“Go ahead, maybe you’ll find some unexpected gain!”

“This time, all ten of us old men have put our hearts into it!” Hei Bai Wu Chang saw Luo Tian had lost his Rebirth Grass, hoping he could find a chance to break through. Being stuck at the Early Stage of the Immortal King wasn’t good.

“Never mind, let Star Xingxuan take this chance. I’ll go to the Front Gate!” Luo Tian shook his head, not wanting to take this opportunity for strength enhancement.

After discussing with Hei Bai Wu Chang, Luo Tian left the hall. Outside, Da Niu and Er Niu waited anxiously.

“Senior Disciple Luo!” Da Niu and Er Niu, unfamiliar with the place, relied heavily on Luo Tian.

“Don’t worry. Get used to it slowly. You might have to stay here for a while!” Luo Tian smiled, leading Da Niu and Er Niu through the Reincarnation Palace, introducing them constantly.

“Hey, you! Come over. Show these two around. I have some matters to attend to!” After introducing for a while, Luo Tian felt bored and also missed Fu Xingxuan. He entrusted Da Niu and Er Niu to a Reincarnation Palace disciple, then flew toward the Ghost-Devil Pavilion.

Chapter 2564: Gathering()

Luo Tian rushed through the Yellow Springs, seeing Fu Xingxuan standing there. His heart raced; he grabbed her without hesitation.

“Little girl, you ran off! I’ll beat your bottom!” Luo Tian smiled, slapping her playfully.

Luo Tian sent out a barrier, sealing the two. They seemed like dry vegetables in a fierce fire.

Crash...

The Yellow Springs surged, gray water droplets falling on the white lotus. After half an hour, the barrier faded. Luo Tian smiled, embracing Fu Xingxuan.

“Did you find Leng Qiuchan?” Luo Tian asked Fu Xingxuan, his gaze puzzled.

“Found!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Fu Xingxuan sighed deeply, her gaze showing concern.

“We returned together. Her corpse qi was heavy. She stayed in the Yellow Springs for a year before fully purifying it!”

“But after recovering, Qiu Chan seemed like another person. She rarely spoke to anyone except me. Originally cold-hearted, she became even colder. Recently, she left again without saying goodbye. I don’t know where she went!” Fu Xingxuan spoke, eyes filled with blame and self-reproach.

“Good things happen to good people. Don’t worry!” Luo Tian comforted softly. He didn’t know how to face it.

“Regaining memories, but my Rebirth Grass is gone. There’s no Rebirth Grass in the Blood Wolf Valley!” Luo Tian sighed inwardly.

“The Master said there’s a joint enhancement for Senior Disciples. Go, I don’t need it now. Maybe you’ll protect me later!” Luo Tian smiled.

“Okay.” Fu Xingxuan nodded. She was still worried about Leng Qiuchan, but after the last incident, she wouldn’t leave again.

They talked all night. The next day, Luo Tian left the Ghost-Devil Pavilion, greeted Hei Bai Wu Chang, and exited the Reincarnation Palace. As for Da Niu and Er Niu, he left them there, letting them adapt to life in the Reincarnation Palace.

He entrusted Da Niu and Er Niu’s safety to Fu Xingxuan and Hei Bai Wu Chang. He wasn’t worried.

“Truly comfortable!” Luo Tian flew alone under the dark sky, leisurely. He sighed, comparing this to the Ghost-Devil Marsh—no longer needing to fear for his life every moment.

“That place, if it weren’t necessary, I’d never go back!” Luo Tian thought to himself, observing the Underworld’s state. Though conditions were harsh, he felt unusually comfortable.

“You only have a few days left. If we don’t attack the Immortal Realm soon, other sects will stop too. They might even unite against us!”

“Tianyuan Sect is our home. You’ve lost your memory, so you don’t know. But no matter what, you mustn’t fight against Tianyuan Sect or harm a single person!” Luo Tian recalled the words of Fu Xingxuan and Hei Bai Wu Chang before leaving.

“Troublesome,” Luo Tian thought to himself. This was a mess, but he had to solve it.

...

Tianlan Sect, one of the three-day百家 sects in the Immortal Realm. Its strength ranked at the bottom, which is why its position was remote, being the closest to the Front Gate.

When the Underworld attacked and pushed into the Immortal Realm’s million miles, Tianlan Sect was the first to face it.

At that moment, ten thousand miles away, black mist drifted. The Reincarnation Palace’s banner soared to the heavens. The Underworld’s Reincarnation Palace army was stationed there.

Since three years ago, both sides had been in this state. Though they often attacked each other, casualties were minimal.

At that moment, in Tianlan Sect’s council hall, figures sat there. The leader was Jiang Hongbing, a senior of the Bountiful Heaven Sect. He was one of Bountiful Heaven’s several younger brothers.

Jiang Hongbing sat beside Jiang Yuexiong. Then came Tianyuan Sect’s people, about seven or eight of them. Each had a formidable aura.

Tianlan Sect’s sect master sat at the lowest position, as his strength was only Half-Step Immortal King. Compared to those present, he was far behind.

“Other major sects have pressured us. If we don’t retaliate, they’ll attack us first!”

“Also, Tianyuan Sect has been watching closely recently,” Jiang Hongbing spoke softly, gazing at Tianyuan Sect’s people.

The hall was quiet. Everyone’s eyes were filled with concern—this wasn’t a small matter.

“Major sects have been pressuring us for a long time. If we keep delaying, it’s not good. Also, Tianyuan Sect reported that some disciples went out and were mysteriously killed!”

“Now we’re all in the same boat!” Run Hongyu spoke, gazing at Jiang Hongbing.

“So whether to fight or not, without Luo Tian, we can’t communicate with the Underworld. If we don’t fight soon, major sects might act directly and even destroy us. Tianyuan Sect has touched too many sects’ interests and dignity!” Jiang Hongbing frowned.

“How are your preparations at home?” Long Jie asked. They hadn’t been idle for years. Tianyuan Sect had half its people come here under the guise of support.

“Wan Lingkong said it needs more time!” A young man spoke, wearing black clothes and emitting a cold aura.

This was Xiu. For years, Tianyuan Sect had gained fame across the nine regions, drawing most people into it. Even Jin Xiyang and Manhun’s royal heirs had left their sects to join Tianyuan Sect.

Now, Tianyuan Sect was stronger by two or three times than when it first formed. If not for the top-tier Immortal Kings, its strength could rival the nine major sects.

“Damn it, we’ll rebel. Who dares to touch us!” Yaochen’s face showed anger. These people were all proud.

“What do we fight with? You think major sects can’t descend? It’s just the cost is high. If they personally descend, we can’t withstand one!” Run Hongyu snorted.

“I’ve also refined Rebirth Pills. I don’t know if the Underworld has rescued Luo Tian. If not, we’ll ask the Heavenly Court to come!” Jiang Yuexiong spoke softly. Their biggest card was the Ancient Heavenly Court.

“Unfortunately, only Ziping and Jichen can enter the Ancient Heavenly Court!” Everyone sighed deeply.

They had tried to send people for the Heavenly Court’s exams, but all failed—only two succeeded.

They discussed again, but no good solutions emerged. The only path was to fight and repel the Underworld.

Buzz...

As they discussed, waves fell on Sima Tuo. He was startled and took out a token to receive the message.

Now, Sima Tuo had a group of people responsible for gathering intelligence. This man was skilled in stealth and stealing.

“Everyone!”

“The scout reported that Luo Tian has arrived at the enemy’s camp!” Sima Tuo addressed them, making the hall instantly quiet.

“What?” After the silence, it turned chaotic. People’s eyes showed disbelief as they gazed at Sima Tuo.

“Is the information accurate?” They asked, fearing a mistake.

“It’s accurate. Several scouts reported it!” Sima Tuo replied, making their faces show joy.

“Damn it, this makes things easier. We can’t decide anymore. Let’s see if he fights or negotiates!” Yaochen laughed, passing the problem to Luo Tian.

“But what if this kid doesn’t recognize anyone and fights us?” They began discussing soon after.

Giving him pills would make him refuse to eat. Need a plan to get this kid to take the Rebirth Pills...

Tianlan Sect kept discussing. Meanwhile, the Underworld camp was also lively.

In the camp, Luo Tian stood in a spacious room, gazing at familiar figures—Wu Mian and Yu Tian were there.

Luo Tian had flown for eight days, finally reaching the camp and finding the Reincarnation Palace’s base.

“Respect your master!” Luo Tian bowed, gazing at the old man seated first—Du Jianxing, the Poison Sword Sect’s Tianzun.

“Back is good. Back is good. You really don’t let us rest!” Du Jianxing smiled.

“Respect the Senior Disciple!” Others also showed respect, bowing to Luo Tian.

“Boy, you’re here just in time. Tell us your thoughts!” After exchanging greetings, Du Jianxing addressed Luo Tian, calming the camp.

“Right now, we haven’t had a real battle. Once it starts, the consequences will be severe!” Wu Mian spoke. Though Du Jianxing was here, he mainly served as a deterrent. The main commander was Wu Mian—showing how crucial Wu Mian was.

“General, what’s your plan?” Luo Tian asked softly. He knew Wu Mian must have a strategy.

“Persuade them to surrender! If the Senior Disciple doesn’t want to fight, he must make them surrender!” Wu Mian spoke softly. This was also what he hoped for—since the enemy wasn’t easy, and Wu Mian valued soldiers’ lives.

“How to persuade? Just talking won’t make them surrender. Don’t forget, the nine major sects aren’t easy either. They won’t agree to surrender!” Yu Tian frowned, gazing at Wu Mian.

“I’ll go challenge them tomorrow and see the situation!” Luo Tian sighed deeply. This was indeed a thorny issue, with both sides opposing each other and too many problems.

They discussed all night. The next morning, as the sun rose, a horn sounded in the Underworld army’s camp. Soldiers stood up, gathering.

Chapter 2565: Ambush()

The assembly call!

Underworld soldiers showed surprise. They had been stationed here for three years, rarely hearing the assembly call. Yet they gathered uniformly.

“100,000 people, follow us!” Wu Mian’s voice echoed. Commanders and lieutenants began calling names.

An hour later, 100,000 people stood neatly outside the camp, eyes filled with excitement.

“Are we going to fight?” Everyone murmured. They were soldiers; if they didn’t fight, they felt uncomfortable.

Figures stood in the sky. Wu Mian was first, with Wang Gang and Du Tianming beside him.

But people focused on Luo Tian standing there, eyes filled with respect.

“Go!” Wu Mian spoke. Luo Tian, Wang Gang, Yu Tian, and others flew into the sky toward Tianlan Sect.

Banners waved. 100,000 people marched out of the camp, following Luo Tian’s group.

The heavens roared. Ten thousand miles was neither far nor near, but it took time for a hundred thousand to go.

As the Underworld forces just set out, scouts sent messages to Tianlan Sect’s position.

“How come Luo Tian returns and immediately attacks us?” Upon hearing the scout’s report, Long Jie and others were stunned.

At that moment, Tianlan Sect also gathered troops, preparing to attack the Underworld.

“Good timing. Follow the plan!” Run Hongyu spoke softly. Soon, figures flew from Tianlan Sect’s peak—led by Diaodezhu.

“These people have good information!” Wu Mian flew in the sky, listening to his subordinates’ reports.

The Underworld also had scouts outside Tianlan Sect. Thus, when Long Jie and others emerged, Wu Mian also received the news.

Two great forces rushed toward each other. Within half an hour, both sides saw each other and stopped.

They stood ten thousand feet apart, gazing at each other. This was the first large-scale movement between both sides in years.

“Many old acquaintances!” Luo Tian stood in the sky, seeing Diaodezhu, Long Jie, Yaochen, and others.

“Indeed it’s Luo Tian!” Long Jie and others were excited. They had been worried about Luo Tian being trapped.

“Now it’s your turn, Senior Disciple!” Wu Mian spoke. People’s eyes turned to Luo Tian. This was their purpose—to test him.

Luo Tian flew up, standing on the battlefield. He gazed at them: “Who will fight me!”

Luo Tian held his blood sword, eyes full of battle spirit as he gazed at Diaodezhu and others.

“This fool must’ve gone mad. He’s so arrogant!” Hearing Luo Tian’s challenge, Diaodezhu and others muttered.

Buzz...

Yaochen naturally stepped forward. He flew up with his golden staff, heading toward Luo Tian.

These past days had driven Yaochen crazy. No one to fight, so he had sealed his cultivation to spar with Tianyuan Sect soldiers.

Golden staff struck down. Luo Tian smiled, raising his blood sword to meet it.

The void trembled. Thunder rose from their collision. Both men retreated.

“His strength has increased a lot!” Luo Tian thought, recalling their fight eight years ago. He had known Yaochen’s strength then.

Now, after visiting the Ghost-Devil Marsh and strengthening himself, Luo Tian hadn’t expected Yaochen’s strength to have increased so much.

Both men retreated. Luo Tian stepped back a hundred feet, while Yaochen retreated a thousand.

“This bastard has grown stronger!” Seeing Luo Tian repelling Yaochen, Diaodezhu and others cursed.

“Follow the plan!” Run Hongyu spoke. Long Jie, Shiluo, Diaodezhu, and others vanished from sight.

“Again!” Yaochen laughed. But he was surprised, feeling the gap between him and Luo Tian widening.

“I need to break through!” Yaochen thought. Luo Tian was his best opponent. He moved, attacking Luo Tian again.

“Senior Disciple’s might!” Underworld soldiers were excited, watching Luo Tian and Yaochen battle without losing.

“What’s that? Once the Senior Disciple fought four at once, this monkey was no problem!” Underworld soldiers discussed.

Collisions echoed. Blood sword and golden staff clashed repeatedly, the sky swirling, winds reversing.

In a short while, they fought for hundreds of rounds. Yaochen’s blood surged, golden hair standing upright. His lips bled as he stared at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian smiled, gazing back at Yaochen. He shook his numb arm.
