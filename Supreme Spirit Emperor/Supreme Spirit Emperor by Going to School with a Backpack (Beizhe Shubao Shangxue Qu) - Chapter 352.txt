“Go!” Sun Kewnian repeatedly calculated, his eyes filled with solemnity as he walked through the tomb-like formation. Every few steps, he recalculated, clearly avoiding some forbidden presence.

Time slowly passed. Sun Kewnian’s face bore a look of great joy as he led Luo Tian and the others to a massive black coffin. He spoke softly, “We’ve arrived!”

A black coffin stood before Luo Tian and his companions, radiating an icy aura that sent shivers down their spines. Bloodstains, long dried, marked the coffin’s surface—each stain sent a wave of fear through them.

“Should we open the coffin? This one, which has made us all tremble, must contain treasures beyond compare!” Wan Lingkong spoke, his voice laced with admiration.

“Open it! In this line of work, encountering such a coffin, how can we not check? I’ve even dared to lift the coffin of an Epoch Master. Could this one hold an Epoch Master?” Sun Kewnian’s eyes flashed with a ruthless glint. After enduring so much to finally find the real thing, how could he not open it?

“Wait—look at this blood. Whose is it?” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered as he stared at the dried bloodstains on the coffin, his expression filled with unease.

“This isn’t human blood, nor from an ancient royal clan!” Luo Tian spoke solemnly, sensing a different aura in the blood.

“Eighty-one great tombs form a grand formation, guarding this place of extreme yin!”

“Burial of Immortals!” Sun Kewnian’s breath quickened, whispering the legend of his sect.

“What?” Hearing Sun Kewnian’s words, Luo Tian and the others froze in shock, their spirits trembling.

“This is the legendary Burial of Immortals coffin!” Sun Kewnian’s eyes burned with madness. Encountering such a rare coffin was the dream of their trade.

“Don’t open it! It’s too terrifying. If something terrible emerges, our lives will be lost!” Diaodezhu sighed softly, watching Sun Kewnian’s fervent gaze.

“What lies within? Could it truly be an immortal? Who placed this coffin here?” Their minds filled with questions.

“Open it! I must see, even if just once!” Sun Kewnian’s face bore a resolute expression, almost mad.

“Open it!” Luo Tian spoke solemnly, deciding the matter. He too was curious about what lay within.

“Do our best. If we fail, we’ll retreat!” Luo Tian said, his gaze heavy with concern as he looked at the specters and cracked tombs.

“Good!” Sun Kewnian nodded, taking another step toward the ancient black coffin.

Chapter 1418: Death Spirits

“Roar…” As Sun Kewnian took another step, the specters of the ghost city let out a deafening roar, transforming into their true forms and flying toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Crack…” Black mist spilled forth, the eighty-one tombs cracked open, emitting eerie laughter. Sun Kewnian halted.

“Don’t open it! Don’t risk your lives!” Diaodezhu pulled Sun Kewnian back. Just as they approached the coffin, these changes occurred—opening it could bring unknown consequences.

“Must open! Even if just to see!” Sun Kewnian’s face bore a determined look, almost mad.

“Open it!” Luo Tian spoke solemnly, settling the matter. He too was curious about what lay within.

“Do our best. If we fail, we’ll retreat!” Luo Tian said, his gaze heavy with concern as he looked at the specters and cracked tombs.

“Good!” Sun Kewnian nodded, taking another step toward the ancient black coffin.

Chapter 1419: Recently a bit fiery

“Roar…” As Sun Kewnian took another step, countless specters roared again, their forms slowly moving toward Luo Tian’s group.

The cracking sound returned, the eighty-one tombs cracked open again, making Sun Kewnian’s face grim.

Sun Kewnian hesitated. He could sense the specters’ intense hostility, as if they were servants guarding a master.

At that moment, if it were just Sun Kewnian alone, he would have opened the coffin without hesitation. But with Luo Tian and his companions present, he couldn’t ignore their safety.

“Open it!” As Sun Kewnian hesitated, Luo Tian’s voice echoed in his ears.

“Grave robbers! Do you plan to come back later and take all the treasures? Don’t dream, today we must open it!” Diaodezhu shouted at Sun Kewnian, his voice laced with impatience.

“Hmph…” Sun Kewnian sneered, then shouted loudly: “Who do you think I am? Would I do such a thing!”

His body moved swiftly, without hesitation. Sun Kewnian flew toward the ancient black coffin, his body trembling violently, eyes filled with fear. An overwhelming pressure fell upon him.

“Hum…” The Yang Fish appeared above Sun Kewnian’s head, restoring his rigid body to normal. His face showed excitement.

“Clatter…” Tools appeared before Sun Kewnian, each ancient and not ordinary.

“Such a lot of treasures!” Diaodezhu frowned but soon turned serious, his gaze deep.

“Roar…” A low roar rose, black figures surged forth, rushing toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Hold them off!” Luo Tian spoke to his companions as Sun Kewnian began to act.

“Boom… Boom…” Thunderous sounds rose, the eighty-one tombs shattered violently. Terroristic black mist surged forth, forming into countless black figures before Luo Tian’s group.

“Ah…” Eighty-one figures roared, their eyes glowing blood-red, locking onto Sun Kewnian.

“This is a death spirit born from an Epoch Master’s corpse. Be careful!” Sun Kewnian warned his companions, a hint of gratitude in his voice.

“Do your job!” Luo Tian moved swiftly, his Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword in hand. He slashed at a black figure.

Furious thunder, imbued with supreme yang power, appeared before the black figure. It sent shivers through the ghost city’s specters.

“Boom…” Wan Lingkong, Diaodezhu, and Ren Hongzhe also attacked simultaneously, striking a black figure with punches.

However, moments later, their faces showed shock. Their attacks had no effect on the black figure, passing through it harmlessly.

“Use the talismans, martial arts, and body techniques I gave you. These death spirits are immune to your attacks!” Sun Kewnian warned them, his long experience in tombs making him familiar with these spirits.

“Ah…” The death spirit roared lowly, emitting thick smoke from its body. This caused it some damage.

“Thunder Sword is effective!” Luo Tian felt, his sword movements weaving a net of thunder that crushed the countless specters.

White mist rose, annihilating many specters. Luo Tian sighed in relief—any effective attack was good.

“Sizzle…” Diaodezhu, Wan Lingkong, and Ren Hongzhe lit the talismans they had received from Sun Kewnian, throwing them at the death spirits and specters.

“Boom… Boom… Boom…” Thunderous sounds rose in the mass of specters.

Each talisman, once activated, either transformed into a sea of thunder or an apocalyptic fire, annihilating many specters.

“Ah…” The eighty-one black figures roared lowly, their blood-red eyes showing fear. They gazed at Luo Tian’s group but eventually roared madly, gathering together.

Luo Tian and his companions tried to stop them, but they were entangled by the relentless specters. These things attacked suicidally, ignoring Luo Tian’s attacks. They surged forward in waves of relentless assaults.

“Damn!” Luo Tian’s face darkened, watching the eighty-one figures merge into one. A powerful aura, so overwhelming it made Luo Tian’s spirit tremble, emerged.

These were not spirits. If they were, Luo Tian would have no fear. Though similar to a spirit’s state, there was an essential difference.

Spirits had thoughts; these things had none. They were powerful entities born from an Epoch Master’s corpse, and in this place of extreme yin, their power was amplified.

“Xiaoqi!” Luo Tian pressed his hands to his forehead. A seven-color flame leapt out, and Xiaoqi appeared beside him.

“Burn it! I want to burn through this place of extreme yin!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cruelty, speaking to Xiaoqi.

“Ah…” Xiaoqi opened her mouth, and a wave of flames erupted from it. They surged toward the sea-like specters.

The seven-color flame carried a supreme aura, warming this icy ghost city.

But the specters were too many. Even Xiaoqi’s flames could not exterminate them quickly, only matching the specters’ forces.

Thick gray mist rose, enveloping the ghost city. No one would have imagined that within the vast thunder swamp, such a massive battle erupted.

“Roar…” Under Luo Tian’s group’s anxious gaze, the eighty-one black figures finally merged into one, materializing as a middle-aged man.

“Who are you…” A low roar echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. An invisible pressure made their spirits tremble.

“Epoch Master! Damn, how can we fight this!” Diaodezhu’s eyes trembled. Before an Epoch Master, they could not resist. The immense pressure alone affected his strength. Moreover, the enemy was immune to martial arts and body attacks—only things of supreme yang could harm it.

“What do we do?” Diaodezhu, Wan Lingkong, and Ren Hongzhe turned their gazes to Luo Tian.

“I don’t know!” Luo Tian was also speechless. He looked at Sun Kewnian, who was fully focused on opening the ancient coffin and hadn’t noticed their situation.

“Fight! Wan, if it fails, set up the Heaven-Ordained Punishment Array!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with cruelty. He wielded his Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword, rushing toward the black death spirit amidst the seven-color fire.

“There’s still a chance. The death spirit isn’t fully intelligent!” Diaodezhu spoke softly, knowing they couldn’t help much.

“Heaven-Ordained Punishment Array!” Wan Lingkong spoke softly, flying up. Golden banners flew from his hands, spreading outward to encircle them.

“Hope it works!” Wan Lingkong muttered. Though the Heaven-Ordained Punishment Array was powerful, he wasn’t sure if it could withstand an Epoch Master’s death spirit.

“Fight!” Luo Tian activated his Heaven-Ordained Thunder Sword, stabbing it into the black death spirit’s body. Just an inch in, it felt like piercing iron, a wisp of white smoke rising from the spirit.

“Boom…” Thunderous sounds echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. A black hand, imbued with supreme power, descended upon him, striking his body.

“Puke…” Luo Tian felt as if struck by a mountain. Blood spewed from his mouth, and his body began to crack.

“Boom…” The reincarnation immortal body in his dantian shattered, replacing Luo Tian’s death.

Luo Tian’s eyes showed shock. He fell into the seven-color fire, carried back to his companions by Xiaoqi.

“Not enough! Too strong. The gap between us and an Epoch Master is too great. Even Luo Tian’s body couldn’t withstand one strike!” Diaodezhu trembled, despairing before an Epoch Master.

Luo Tian stopped the blood from his mouth. His face was pale as paper. Now he understood the gap between himself and an Epoch Master—even a soulless death spirit was beyond his current strength.

“I can’t hold on!” Xiaoqi’s face was covered in sweat, her eyes showing weakness. The addition of the Epoch Master death spirit had drained her significantly.

“Yin Fish!” Luo Tian waved his hand. The Yin Fish appeared above them, emitting a dark glow. He then spoke to Wan Lingkong.

“Activate the Heaven-Ordained Punishment Array!” As Luo Tian’s words finished, Wan Lingkong planted the array banners into the ground.

With the banners placed, a hum rose. Black storm clouds instantly enveloped the ghost city. A torrent of green thunder descended.

“Crack…” Water-trunk thick lightning fell from the sky, enveloping the ghost city.

“Roar…” The death spirits were annihilated by the apocalyptic thunder. A spine-chilling scream echoed in Luo Tian’s ears.

The black death spirit’s eyes glowed red. Struck by the thunder, it showed no sensation. It strode forward toward Luo Tian’s group under the Yin Fish.

Chapter 1420: Recently a bit fiery

“What do we do?” Diaodezhu and the others watched the death spirit approaching, its steps undeterred by the thunder. They spoke in trembling voices.

“I don’t know! Sun Kewnian, bastard, we told you to play with death. Think of a way quickly!” Diaodezhu shouted at Sun Kewnian, who stood focused.

“Crack…” Thunderous energy clashed against the Yin Fish’s barrier, emitting a series of booming sounds.

“Roar…” The thunder’s power increased. The ghost city became a world of lightning. Countless specters were annihilated by the apocalyptic thunder, leaving only the black Epoch Master death spirit.

As the thunder’s power grew, the massive death spirit was restrained. The lightning’s damage to it far exceeded what Luo Tian and his companions had imagined.

Black mist rose from the death spirit, resisting the lightning. In a moment, the black figure reached Luo Tian’s group, fighting against the thunder while its massive hand descended upon them.

“Boom…” Though the death spirit’s power was restrained by the thunder, its presence still made Luo Tian and his companions tremble.

“Epoch Master! Too strong. We can’t resist!” Their spirits shook, watching the apocalyptic hand descend upon their barrier.

“Boom…” A violent wave instantly swept over Luo Tian’s group, shaking their spirits.

“Damn! We can’t last long like this!” Diaodezhu watched the Yin Fish’s barrier, which wavered in their sight. He shouted loudly.

“Sun Kewnian! Think of a way quickly!” Diaodezhu roared, turning to Sun Kewnian, whose eyes were deeply focused.

“Got it!” As Diaodezhu’s words finished, Sun Kewnian’s body trembled. His eyes showed excitement as he shouted.

“Haha, I’m such a genius!” Sun Kewnian roared into the sky. He felt the terrifying thunder clashing against the Yang Fish’s barrier, so he shrank his head.

“Rude! You’re still laughing. What a rude person!” Diaodezhu’s face was angry, watching Sun Kewnian standing there.

“Damn! What is this thing? A ghost king? How did you bring it out!” Sun Kewnian shouted, his voice laced with fear.

“It’s not because of you. It’s the thing from the eighty-one tombs, merged together!” Diaodezhu cursed.

“Boom…” As thunder roared again, the black death spirit attacked. Luo Tian’s group trembled. The Yin Fish barrier had begun to crack.

Golden thunder continuously fell, striking the death spirit. It seemed to enter a frenzy, constantly punching at the Yin Fish barrier.

“What do we do, Sun Kewnian? You said you were professional!” Luo Tian also shouted anxiously.

“Use child’s urine!” But then, Sun Kewnian’s face turned serious as he spoke to Luo Tian and the others.

“What?” Hearing Sun Kewnian’s words, Luo Tian and his companions were stunned. They hadn’t heard correctly, their eyes filled with disbelief. They couldn’t believe Sun Kewnian had suggested such a method.

“Child’s urine? You…” Luo Tian looked at Wan Lingkong, Ren Hongzhe, and Diaodezhu.

“I… am…” Diaodezhu’s face turned red. He spoke to Luo Tian and the others, his voice carrying some embarrassment.

“I… am too!” Wan Lingkong, seeing someone start, also turned red and spoke. His eyes glared at Sun Kewnian.

“I… am…” Ren Hongzhe’s eyes showed some shyness. He nodded slightly.

“Haha…” Luo Tian watched the three with red faces. Though the situation was urgent, he couldn’t help laughing.

“Diaodezhu, I never thought this would happen. You once boasted about having several in one night! Now you’ve become a child? Haha!” Luo Tian couldn’t help mocking, recalling Diaodezhu’s past boasts. His eyes showed disdain.

“Haha…” Hearing Luo Tian shifted the topic to Diaodezhu, the other three also laughed. They mocked Diaodezhu.

“Don’t talk about me! Wan Lingkong, you once boasted too. And you, Ren Hongzhe, I remember you said you came for fun!” Diaodezhu retaliated.

“Enough! Don’t waste time. Urinate quickly!” Sun Kewnian flew back to Luo Tian’s group, throwing a large jar in front of them.

“This…” Diaodezhu and the others stared at each other, no one moved.

“Damn! What are you looking at? It’s about to break!” Sun Kewnian cursed, making them react instantly.

“Don’t care about face now. Brothers, life is important!” Luo Tian scolded them and then covered the soul-eating silkworm’s eyes.

“Urinate! We’re all men. Don’t be embarrassed!” Luo Tian spoke again, his voice filled with urgency.

“Give it up…” Diaodezhu’s face turned red. He began to undress and stood there.

Seeing someone take the lead, Wan Lingkong and Ren Hongzhe also showed determination. They surrounded the jar with Diaodezhu.

“Good thing I didn’t say I was a virgin! That would be too embarrassing!” Sun Kewnian thought, watching the four men staring at each other.

“Luo Tian… I… I can’t urinate!” Diaodezhu turned to Luo Tian, his voice filled with tension.

Wan Lingkong and Ren Hongzhe were the same. They stood there, faces red, but no drops fell. Their bodies even trembled, yet the more they hurried, the harder it was.

“Don’t be tense… relax…” Luo Tian sighed deeply and spoke to them.

“Shhh…” To ensure they urinated, Luo Tian even whistled. Diaodezhu and the others were speechless.

But the whistle’s power was strong. Three streams of urine appeared before them, emitting a sound of flowing water.

“What’s the smell… Diaodezhu, you’re too smelly! I swear!” Wan Lingkong and Ren Hongzhe looked at Diaodezhu with disgust and contempt, cursing him.

“Sorry, I’ve been a bit fiery recently!” Diaodezhu awkwardly lifted his pants and brought the jar to Sun Kewnian.

“Damn!” Sun Kewnian pinched his nose, almost vomiting. His eyes showed disdain as he looked at Diaodezhu.

“Crack…” Before Sun Kewnian could speak further, the barrier before Luo Tian’s group broke under the black death spirit’s attacks. It shattered into fragments, consumed by golden thunder.

At the same time, a massive hand, covering the sky, descended upon Luo Tian’s group with supreme heavenly power.

“Is it effective?” The four men trembled, looking at Sun Kewnian with disbelief.

Child’s urine—there was a saying in the human world that it could repel ghosts. But Luo Tian and his companions were cultivators. An Epoch Master’s death spirit defeated by child’s urine—this was something they deeply doubted.

As the black hand descended, Sun Kewnian performed a seal. A seven-foot-long sword appeared in his hands. He burned a yellow talisman and inserted it into the excrement of Diaodezhu and the others.

“Hum…” Waves of energy emerged. The talisman burned out, its ashes quickly forming a Taijitu pattern.

“One thing overcomes another. Do you understand?” Sun Kewnian looked at their disbelief and threw the jar toward the black hand.

“Boom…” As it flew, Sun Kewnian detonated it. A flash of yellow light appeared and scattered over the black death spirit’s massive body.

“Ah…” Next moment, a piercing scream echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. Their faces showed joy. It actually worked.

“Sizzle…” White smoke rose, the black death spirit seemed to be set on fire. Its body writhed and roared in pain, its voice filled with agony.

“Look! My hand waved, and the Epoch Master’s death spirit was annihilated!” Sun Kewnian’s eyes showed pride. He watched the stunned Luo Tian and his companions.

“This really worked! That was an Epoch Master, a death spirit that could weaken even martial arts and body attacks. Did it really die like this?” Luo Tian watched the death spirit roaring, its body glowing with green flames. Its power was gradually weakening.

“It’s because of my urine!” Diaodezhu looked at Sun Kewnian’s smug expression. He felt a bit annoyed—this was his chance to show off.

“Get lost…” Luo Tian and the others kicked Diaodezhu far away, recalling the strong smell just now.

“Roar…” As they spoke, the black death spirit’s massive form finally vanished. The ghost city fell silent again, only thunderous sounds echoing.

“Next, it’s this Burial of Immortals coffin!” Luo Tian and the others licked their lips. Their eyes showed intense desire.

“After studying so long, can we open it?” Diaodezhu asked Sun Kewnian, his voice filled with inquiry.

“It can’t be opened. This coffin is beyond my ability. It’s too complex. Even our sect’s ancestors couldn’t open it. Unless an immortal truly exists!” Sun Kewnian shook his head, making Luo Tian and the others disappointed.

Chapter 1421: Immortal Skin

“You said it can’t be opened?” Hearing Sun Kewnian’s words, Diaodezhu and the others were unpleased. Their eyes turned dangerous as they looked at Sun Kewnian.

“I nearly sacrificed my life for this! You say it can’t be opened?” Diaodezhu shouted, his voice laced with threat.

Luo Tian also looked at Sun Kewnian with glimmers in his eyes. But seeing the sorrow in Sun Kewnian’s eyes, he sighed deeply.

“Quickly compensate us!” Diaodezhu extended his hand, looking at Sun Kewnian with threat.

“Don’t talk so much! Let him finish speaking!” Sun Kewnian showed impatience on his face, looking at Diaodezhu.

“I mean it can’t be opened. But we can pry open a crack to see what’s inside!” Sun Kewnian said with a hint of pride to Luo Tian and the others.

“Damn! You didn’t say that earlier. Why wait?!” Diaodezhu slapped Sun Kewnian’s shoulder, his face filled with excitement as he looked at the black ancient coffin.

“Yeah, pry it open! But you mustn’t be careless. I don’t know what’s inside. If it truly holds an immortal, we might die!” Sun Kewnian said with caution to Luo Tian and the others.

“If it holds an immortal, it should be dead. I don’t believe a dead person we can’t handle!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed determination, looking at the ancient coffin radiating powerful energy. Thunder surged around it but could not move the coffin.

“Hum…” Wan Lingkong collected his golden banners, and the Heaven-Ordained Punishment Array vanished. The ghost city returned to calm.

After discussing, they approached the coffin and stood behind Sun Kewnian, preventing any unexpected incidents.

Sun Kewnian moved his hands, carving onto the ancient coffin. His eyes were solemn as he etched marks upon it. Each mark caused the coffin to emit a deep rumble.

“Open!” After carving for half an hour, Sun Kewnian finally slammed his hands onto the coffin’s lid. The black ancient coffin radiated a terrifying aura.

“Don’t open it!” The soul-eating silkworm’s face showed fear. She tightly grasped Luo Tian’s sleeve, her eyes filled with terror.

“What’s wrong?” Luo Tian pulled the soul-eating silkworm’s hand, looking at her.

“The one that frightened me lives here!” The soul-eating silkworm spoke tremblingly.

“Crack…” But the soul-eating silkworm’s words were too late. The black coffin lid trembled violently, unlike the eerie feeling. A crack slowly opened on the massive ancient coffin, and golden light spilled out—giving a sacred feeling.

“Is it really an immortal!” Luo Tian’s spirit trembled, watching the ultimate light. He felt immense awe.

“So powerful! What lies within this coffin!” Diaodezhu trembled, his body uncontrollably changing into his true form. His purple fur all shivered.

“Open…” Sun Kewnian roared again, his Epoch Master hand grabbing the coffin lid. His body trembled as the lid opened slightly.

Light spread everywhere, an overwhelming aura radiating from the ancient coffin. Luo Tian and his companions felt a sense of worship.

“Quickly look! What’s inside? I can’t last long!” Sun Kewnian shouted at Luo Tian, his voice laced with urgency.

“It’s not moving!” Diaodezhu and the others blinked, paralyzed by the immense pressure.

“Don’t fail now!” Luo Tian roared. The remaining two reincarnation immortal bodies in his dantian surged violently, blood and qi flowing. His body radiated white light as he leaped toward the coffin.

“Clap…” Luo Tian flew up, resisting the immense pressure. He struggled to rise, his hands gripping the coffin tightly. His arms bulged with veins as he slowly climbed into the crack of the lid, his eyes flashing purple.

“This…” When Luo Tian saw the scene inside the coffin through the crack, his spirit trembled. He almost fell from the coffin.

Inside the massive coffin lay a figure, peaceful and calm. It radiated powerful waves. The person’s appearance was exactly Luo Tian himself.

“How is this possible!” Luo Tian’s heart trembled. He saw himself lying still in the coffin, surrounded by powerful waves. Various treasures were piled there—like a small treasure vault. Pills, weapons, armor—all present.

“This isn’t right!” Luo Tian roared in his heart. He didn’t believe what he saw was real. After all, he stood alive here. How could he be dead?

“Sun Kewnian! Use the method that let us see specters on me!” Luo Tian shouted at Sun Kewnian.

“Sizzle…” Sun Kewnian waved his hand. Golden talismans burned, directly etched onto Luo Tian’s forehead.

“Third Eye of Heaven!” The golden eye appeared on Luo Tian’s forehead, allowing him to clearly see the contents within the ancient coffin.

“An immortal skin!” Next moment, Luo Tian’s heart was rocked. A human skin lay within the coffin, still intact and unshriveled.

“What!” Sun Kewnian’s face was drenched in cold sweat. The Yang Fish hovered above his head, forcing himself to Luo Tian’s height, looking at the coffin.

“It’s your master!” Sun Kewnian was stunned. His eyes showed disbelief, seeing something different from Luo Tian.

“It’s a human skin! Use your method to look!” Luo Tian spoke to Sun Kewnian, looking at the terrifying aura human skin.

“This is! An immortal skin!” Sun Kewnian’s forehead also showed golden light. He saw the same scene as Luo Tian, his voice trembling almost to close the coffin.

“What about these treasures? Are they all immortal artifacts!” Sun Kewnian’s eyes showed disbelief and greed.

“Quickly take them! Taking just one would make us rich!” Sun Kewnian shouted at Luo Tian, his voice urgent.

“Inside this ancient coffin, there truly lies an immortal!” Hearing the conversation between Luo Tian and Sun Kewnian, Diaodezhu and Wan Lingkong’s eyes were filled with shock. They wanted to approach but the overwhelming pressure was too great.

“Take it!” Luo Tian extended his hand into the ancient coffin, reaching for a long sword radiating supreme aura. He knew any item from the coffin would be priceless.

This human skin was definitely no ordinary thing. The person before must have been an Epoch Master. Luo Tian even suspected this skin was beyond the Epoch Master.

“Come!” Luo Tian grabbed the sword’s hilt, using his strength to pull it out.

“Hum…” But the sword emitted a strong repulsion force, sending Luo Tian flying backward instantly.

“Damn!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with madness. His reincarnation immortal bodies surged violently, returning to the coffin. He stared at the sword with determination.

“Hurry! I can’t last long!” Sun Kewnian roared. His eyes were bloodshot, his expression wild. His cultivation began to burn as he maintained the coffin lid from falling.

“I won’t give up!” Luo Tian attacked again. This time, he shattered one reincarnation immortal body and reached for the sword.

This time, there was no repulsion. But the sword emitted a series of hums. An invisible sword intent emerged from it.

The sharp sword intent carried supreme power, rushing toward Luo Tian. It instantly cut through his body.

Blood splattered. Blood spewed from Luo Tian’s body, nearly cutting him in half. His body fell from the coffin, pale and weak.

“Shatter!” The third reincarnation immortal body shattered instantly. Luo Tian’s wounded body healed, returning to the coffin.

“Not enough! Try another!” Luo Tian knew he couldn’t pull out that sword now.

“Pills!” He then saw the pills placed there. He reached for them.

Grabbing a jade bottle, it violently shook in his hand. Then it shattered, revealing a golden pill radiating light.

Luo Tian felt as if he had grabbed an ultimate sword. His palm ached, but it was much better than grabbing that sword. At least he could hold it.

It seemed to sense Luo Tian had grabbed something. Two red glows appeared, emitting a spine-chilling sound from the human skin.

“He… is coming out. That terrifying thing is about to come out!” The soul-eating silkworm stood on the ground, her small body trembling. Her eyes were wide with fear as she shouted at Luo Tian.

“I can’t last long!” At the same time, Sun Kewnian roared, reminding Luo Tian.

“Come out!” Luo Tian held the ultimate pill in his hand. He used his strength, pushing off the coffin and descending.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian’s hand just emerged, the black coffin lid slammed shut with a dull sound.
