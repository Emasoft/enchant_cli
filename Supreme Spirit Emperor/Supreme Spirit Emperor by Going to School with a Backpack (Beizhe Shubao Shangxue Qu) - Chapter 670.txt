Qiu did not dare to delay, casting the Jueyun Sword toward Luo Tian. As the long sword hummed with a resonant sound, it instantly appeared in Luo Tian's hand.

"One Sword to Sever the Immortals!" Luo Tian, having consumed the demon seed and regained his cultivation, unleashed his most formidable technique. The Jueyun Sword emitted a thunderous cry, its white sword qi transforming the dim sky into daylight. The sound was equally earth-shaking.

Demon energy surged, and under Wang Mie Tian's manipulation, it coalesced into a blade of creation, which crashed downward. In the blink of an eye, the white sword qi clashed with the black blade, and the world fell silent. A deafening explosion echoed over Tian Gui King City, unleashing a violent shockwave that swept across the land.

The entire Tian Gui King City began to collapse, with dust swirling and enveloping it completely. The chaos lasted for a quarter of an hour before finally subsiding.

Cough... cough...

As the dust settled, figures in disarray emerged from the ruins, their eyes filled with fear. They turned their gazes toward two figures standing there—Luo Tian and Wang Mie Tian. Luo Tian's face was pale, his chest marked by grotesque wounds as if torn apart by something. The sight made one's skin crawl. Wang Mie Tian was no better, his face as pale as paper and eyes filled with bitterness.

"Su Dan, kill him!" Luo Tian collapsed to his knees, shouting at Su Dan who stood frozen.

Su Dan leaped into the air, rushing toward Wang Mie Tian while his right hand transformed into a sharp claw, directly aiming for Wang Mie Tian.

"Ah..." Wang Mie Tian roared, attempting to resist but his body was numb, as if not his own.

"Poof..." Blood spurted from Wang Mie Tian's back, the black claw piercing his chest and causing him to fall slowly.

"I won't accept this!" Wang Mie Tian roared, his voice echoing through the sky. His plan was flawless—killing Luo Tian and subduing the Ten Palace Saints and Eight Heavenly Kings. When they seized power, he would become the true master of Hell.

Ten thousand miles away from Tian Gui King City, on a mountain peak, a figure stood there with several small figures made of clay-like material before him. Upon closer inspection, these figures were lifelike; one even bore an exact resemblance to Wang Mie Tian.

"Ah..." As Wang Mie Tian perished, the figure exploded into fragments, and a black crystal fell to the ground.

"Indeed, my opponent. You've devoured one of my pieces so quickly!" The youth reached out and collected the black crystal.

He also gathered the other figures, his eyes revealing a smile before he leaped into the air and vanished from the mountain peak.

Luo Tian collapsed to the ground, his finger tracing a circle as ten-colored flames engulfed Wang Mie Tian, annihilating him and his soul. The flames receded, but Luo Tian was puzzled—another black stone emitted a radiant glow and fell to the ground. Its surface bore divine laws, unmistakably an artifact of great power that made one's mind reel.

"What is this?" Su Dan took the stone, its radiance enveloping him. His expression suddenly changed, and he quickly unleashed a law to seal the stone.

"This stone records Dao Heart Seeding Demon!" Su Dan transmitted mentally to Luo Tian, aware that this artifact was no ordinary item. The stone's connection to Wang Mie Tian's rise was likely profound.

"Keep it safe!" Luo Tian felt a chill, unaware that this stone was the famed Huanmo Stone. If his memory remained, he would have recognized it as the very Huanmo Stone from Guan Hongsheng.

At Wang Mie Tian's death, Ye Qiu and the others' faces darkened as they noticed their own demon seeds beginning to wither.

"Luo Tian, hurry! You said you had a way to free us from this cursed thing!" Wang Xiu shouted, his voice laced with urgency. He felt his cultivation declining despite the ten-colored flames' suppression.

"I need time!" Luo Tian replied, observing the others' pale faces and their waning strength.

"What's happening?" As they fretted, a authoritative voice echoed in their ears. A figure appeared above Tian Gui King City.

"Yefengdu, the Lord of Fengdu!" The group's faces lit up with relief.

"Lord Yefengdu, we've been deceived! A secret technique has sapped our cultivation. Please save us!" They cried out, feeling like they'd found salvation.

"I'll check," Yefengdu's face slightly changed, his spiritual sense penetrating their bodies.

"Dao Heart Seeding Demon!" Yefengdu's face contorted in shock, his hands weaving divine laws that spread over Ye Qiu and the others.

"Even Lord Yefengdu couldn't free us?" The group's hearts sank, their gazes filled with suspicion toward Luo Tian. Yet at that moment, Luo Tian lay unconscious in Su Dan's arms.

"Go!" Yefengdu waved his hand, and they vanished into the sky above the ruined Tian Gui King City.

As they left, the news of Tian Gui King City's destruction spread through Hell. The entire underworld trembled; it had been centuries since the Eight Heavenly Kings' legacy ended. Even the Ten Palace Judges feared them. To witness such a long-standing power vanish was nothing short of a catastrophe.

"Old King Tian Gui, dead. The city reduced to ruins!"
"Could it be the Wheel Turning Palace's Saint Luo Tian? Impossible! He's only at the early Immortal stage. How could he destroy Tian Gui King City?"
"Perhaps it was the Wheel Turning Palace's doing. That must be it!" The underworld murmured in confusion.

Meanwhile, the Ten Palace Judges and old Heavenly Kings rushed to Fengdu Palace, the first of the ten.

Luo Tian vaguely felt he had dreamed of many people he didn't recognize, their presence oddly familiar. His body radiated warmth.

...

Luo Tian opened his eyes, exhaling deeply. Before him stood a face of black and white.

"Kid, you're awake," the Black and White Judges smiled, watching Luo Tian sit up.

"Thank goodness you're awake!" The murmurs of relief echoed in Luo Tian's ears, leaving him dazed.

In the vast hall, a dozen figures stood there, their presence exuding an ancient aura. Besides Su Dan, none were young. The Ten Palace Judges and old Heavenly Kings all stood in the hall, their gazes fixed on Luo Tian, making him uneasy.

"Kid, tell us how to free the Dao Heart Seeding Demon!" A senior demanded, the Lord of Kushen Palace.

"Who's rushing? You responsible for knocking him out?" The Black and White Judges scolded, making the Kushen Palace Lord's face flush with anger but he dared not retaliate.

"We've heard everything. Who knew a duel would lead to so much!"
"Kid, you claim you can free it? Don't lie. I've already made a deal with these guys!" The Black and White Judges transmitted to Luo Tian, clearly having secured great benefits. They valued this greatly, indicating these palace lords had bled heavily.

"An eight in ten chance," Luo Tian smiled, transmitting to the Black and White Judges.

"Lord of the Palace, five-five split?" Luo Tian's words made the Black and White Judges' mouths twitch.

"You're too greedy, kid. I've already prepared for a three-seven split. This time, those guys bled heavily!" The Black and White Judges replied.

"Fine, three-seven it is," Luo Tian said without much concern, agreeing.

"An eight in ten chance is enough!" A palace lord spoke, their confidence higher than theirs.

"Also, Fan Tianyin, Yi Jianren, and those two—no way I'm saving them. They wanted to kill me before! I can't save those who wish to kill me!"

"Reduce the payment for Wang Xiu," Luo Tian said, causing four palace lords' faces to shift.

"Kid, you're overstepping!" The Lords of Yinxian, Huangtian, and Kushen scolded.

Chapter 2509: Avici Hell ()

"Wouldn't have been so tragic if they weren't such poor teammates!" Luo Tian retorted loudly, calling Fan Tianyin and Yi Jianren pigs. Wang Xiu and Ye Qiu nodded in agreement, for if those four hadn't attacked Luo Tian, injuring him, he could have fought alongside Duan Zijue against Wang Mie Tian. But their delay nearly cost them all their lives.

"Old Yeyu, this isn't about favoritism. Their successors were too reckless!" The Black and White Judges smiled.

"I'll start with Ye Qiu first. I need a secret chamber," Luo Tian addressed the group, his gaze on Yefengdu.

"Good!" Yefengdu ignored the complaints of Old Yeyu and the four lords, prioritizing healing Ye Qiu. Soon, Yefengdu prepared a secret chamber for Luo Tian and Ye Qiu to enter.

"Can this kid do it? It's Dao Heart Seeding Demon!" The palace lords and Heavenly Kings doubted, watching the chamber door close.

"Ah..." Before their words finished, a piercing scream echoed from within the chamber, though its soundproofing was good, they still heard clearly.

"Black and White Judges, you're not lying about this Saint?" Their doubts deepened, for even they found it daunting.

"You don't believe me? Then don't heal!" The Black and White Judges smirked, looking at them.

"Black and White Judges, we're all ghosts. Be lenient!" Old Yeyu approached the Black and White Judges, negotiating with them.

"Indeed, Black and White Judges, now is the time to prioritize the greater good. If these four suffer an accident, it would be a loss for us too!" The other three lords spoke hurriedly, desperate to save them.

"Impossible..."
"I'll send ten thousand disciples of the Wheel Turning Palace to train in my Iron Tree Hell for a year!" Old Yeyu spoke, knowing the Black and White Judges were demanding too much.

"Ah, Old Yeyu really laid out the blood," others murmured, impressed by his sacrifice. A hell, especially one's own base, was crucial; no other palace disciples had the right to enter. Each hell was a sacred place for cultivation.

"Impossible..."
"Don't be too demanding, Black and White Judges!" The four lords shouted, surprised by the price.

Outside the chamber, the palace lords argued and haggled with the Black and White Judges. Inside, the screams of Ye Qiu echoed endlessly, creating chaos. Time passed slowly; after an hour, the Black and White Judges and Old Yeyu finally reached an agreement with their pale faces, waiting for Luo Tian and Ye Qiu to emerge.

After an hour, Ye Qiu's screams hadn't stopped, making people more doubtful.

Another half-hour passed, and Ye Qiu's voice was hoarse, but Luo Tian and Ye Qiu still hadn't come out.

Creak...

As people grew impatient, the chamber door opened, revealing Luo Tian and Ye Qiu.

"What did they do?" People saw them drenched in sweat, pale-faced and soaked through.

"It's successful!" But soon they felt Ye Qiu's normal state, though weak, the demon seed was gone.

"After half an hour, next!" Luo Tian sighed, sitting cross-legged to rest.

"Thank you, Brother Luo!" Ye Qiu bowed respectfully, believing any price was worth freeing the cursed restriction.

"Haha! See? I told you this kid's fine!" The Black and White Judges beamed, their pride evident.

The next three days passed smoothly; Luo Tian freed all the Saints and Heavenly Kings, leaving everyone satisfied. After all, cultivating a Saint was costly.

In Fengdu Palace, the group sat together—this was the first time since the last Ten Palace Competition.

But this time, one Heavenly King was missing, causing murmurs. These people were vital to Hell, holding power or future control over it.

"Who knew a figure like this would appear in Hell, nearly wiping out the Ten Palace Saints and Eight Heavenly Kings!" Yefengdu sighed. If Wang Mie Tian had grown, he might have become a force to reckon with.

"Thus, people are always outdone by others; the sky is always higher!"
"Back then, when our Wheel Turning Palace's Reincarnation Pool opened, a kid somehow entered it and nearly got wiped out!"
"To this day, we haven't found him. He must have become a strong one by now!" The Black and White Judges spoke, feeling this lesson was good for the Saints to learn.

"So, whether in Hell or the Immortal realm, there are strong ones we don't know. We must be careful in our actions!" Other palace lords warned.

"Also, Tian Gui King City is destroyed. Should we appoint a new Heavenly King? After all, the Eight Heavenly Kings have existed for so long. Sudden absence would unsettle Hell's people."

"A new Heavenly King is good too. After all, there are many powerful families and city lords in Hell. A Heavenly King position could boost their enthusiasm!" Other palace lords agreed.

The Eight Heavenly Kings also didn't object, as a weak Heavenly King posed no threat.

"Alright, time's about up. Less than ten days until the first battle begins. Let's proceed with the plan. Everyone, go prepare!"

"Selecting a Heavenly King and attacking the Immortal realm can happen simultaneously. Initially, it's just a试探 (probe)!" Yefengdu shifted the topic to the attack.

"Good, see who loses face then!" Ten palace lords laughed, their eyes filled with battle spirit. They rose and left Fengdu Palace with their disciples. The Heavenly Kings also stood, as attacking the Immortal realm was no small matter; they needed to participate.

After leaving, the Black and White Judges remained with Luo Tian. Their black and white eyes glinted with mischief, gazing at Yefengdu.

"Time to fulfill your promise?" The Black and White Judges addressed Yefengdu, recalling the deal for Ye Qiu's treatment.

"Already so eager?" Yefengdu looked at their expressions, unamused.

"The timing's just right. After all, we're going to war; this kid needs to boost his strength!" The Black and White Judges spoke.

"Fine," Yefengdu nodded, then led Luo Tian and the Black and White Judges out of Fengdu Palace's main hall.

They walked along Fengdu Palace's wide road, while Yefengdu was likely transmitting to someone.

After an hour, they finally reached a grand hall outside, but it was filled with figures.

"Respect the Lord and Saint!" Young figures bowed to Yefengdu and Ye Qiu.

"A senior of the Half-Immortal stage spoke, his voice filled with reverence.
"Good!" Yefengdu nodded, then looked at Luo Tian and the Black and White Judges.

"Kid, this opportunity was fought for by me. Avici Hell is much stronger than our Reincarnation Pool. Enter and cherish it; this chance isn't for everyone! Yefengdu's stingy!" The Black and White Judges spoke to Luo Tian.

"Avici Hell!" Hearing the Black and White Judges' transmission, Luo Tian's body slightly trembled. He knew the Eighteen Hells were all precious; for example, the Wheel Turning Palace's Reincarnation Pool was impossible for other palaces to enter. Luo Tian hadn't expected the Black and White Judges to secure such a benefit for him, but he also felt they had gained much from freeing the Dao Heart Seeding Demon.

"Alright, you can enter!" Yefengdu looked at the seemingly sinister hall, addressing Luo Tian and the hundred disciples.

The hundred were all True Immortals, their faces filled with excitement; they had just received news that the Lord of Fengdu Palace personally ordered them to train in Avici Hell.

"During this Avici Hell's opening, try to enhance your strength!" Yefengdu addressed the hundred, then his hands moved, and the black hall's door slowly opened.

"Go! These True Immortals won't trouble you. Yefengdu's really stingy, grabbing every bit of advantage!" The Black and White Judges scoffed.

"Rubbish! I call it waste utilization!"
"Just five days, then close it!" Yefengdu roared.

"Go!" The Black and White Judges kicked Luo Tian, sending him into the hall's door.

"This is an opportunity to reach Half-Immortal or even Early Immortal!" The hundred True Immortals shouted, rushing toward the hall's door.

Chapter 2510: Seven Cities ()

The transmission force descended on Luo Tian, making him shiver inexplicably but unsure why.

Time passed slowly; after an unknown duration, Luo Tian finally stood on solid ground.

Upon landing, he felt a cold sensation; the sound of howls echoed in his ears, familiar souls drifting above. As these souls drifted, waves of pure cultivation power enveloped the sky.

As Luo Tian was awestruck, the Fengdu Palace's elite disciples also descended from the sky, their eyes filled with excitement.

"Is this Avici Hell?"
"My god, this is the best place for cultivation!"
"The cultivation power comes from these souls above. This Avici Hell is the last of the eight, mainly absorbing the cultivation power of those reborn!"
"This isn't the best place. The best lies in those seven cities!" People erupted, their gazes turning to distant towering cities.

"Though the seven cities have more cultivation power, they also carry certain dangers. Once dead, one might never escape!" People whispered, looking at the grand cities.

"Rumors say no one has reached the last city; it's said to directly lead to the end of reincarnation!" Luo Tian listened to the murmurs, his eyes narrowing. This place was similar to the Wheel Turning Palace's Reincarnation Pool but with much stronger cultivation power.

"Indeed, there's a chance to try reaching the Middle Immortal stage!" Luo Tian muttered, watching the Fengdu Palace disciples rush toward the cities. He smiled slightly and vanished in a flash.

What was Luo Tian's cultivation? These True Immortals were no match for him; they hadn't noticed him passing by. Even with his speed, he flew for an hour before reaching the grand city gates.

The gate looked decayed, giving a sense of imminent collapse, but its walls were carved with a fierce beast.

"What is this?" Luo Tian frowned at the two fierce beasts, but he thought it was just the first city and wouldn't trouble him.

Gray souls drifted above, occasionally emitting piercing screams as if pulled into the city by an invisible force.

Luo Tian felt cautious, opening the gate and entering the city. At the same time, the Fengdu Palace's True Immortals arrived at the gate, watching Luo Tian enter and following him into the city.

...

As Luo Tian entered the city, a thick wave of cultivation power instantly reached his perception, making his eyes widen.

"Indeed stronger than outside the city!" Luo Tian muttered but noticed the pure cultivation power gathering toward the city's center.

Gray mist filled the entire city, with a mountain-like entity standing in the empty city's center. Meanwhile, souls walked through the city, their gray faces twisted painfully, as if burdened by a heavy weight.

"These souls must be those who committed evil in their past lives, imprisoned here to suffer punishment. Their bodies carry a mountain's weight, suppressing their souls and preventing rebirth until the term ends," one disciple said, his face filled with awe as he watched the drifting souls.

"This entity in the center must be the Soul-Subduing Beast!" People whispered, not daring to move forward. Their elders had instructed Luo Tian to lead the way.

At that moment, Luo Tian was only ten thousand feet away from the entity. He saw a beast over sixty feet tall, with two horns and a fat body, appearing clumsy but radiating explosive power.

"I was wrong!" Luo Tian thought, not waiting for his attack, the massive beast slowly stood up and rushed toward him. Its thick foot slammed down on Luo Tian.

Luo Tian formed a divine form, transforming into a hundred-foot giant and punched the thick foot.

... A闷 sound echoed, waves spreading outward, sweeping across the area and making the disciples at the city gate pale.

"This battle is beyond our participation. This is only the first city, yet it's so strong. How will we face the next cities?"

"Still, entering this city is a great fortune. Avici Hell allows only Saints and Immortal Elders to enter; past disciples merely drank the soup behind the Saints!" The Fengdu Palace disciples whispered.

The most primitive and violent battle began instantly, with the gray body repeatedly colliding, stomping the ground toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian showed no fear; his physical strength was always his forte, and he enjoyed such battles.

In an instant, the massive body reached Luo Tian's front. He punched again, six shadow fists merging to strike the Soul-Subduing Beast's massive body.

"Roar..." The Soul-Subduing Beast roared, its fat body wrapping around Luo Tian's fist. Its sharp horns pierced toward Luo Tian.

"Only a cry!" Luo Tian exclaimed, his punch's power was enough to kill or injure an Early Immortal. But after the punch, he felt as if hitting cotton, his power being converted by the Soul-Subduing Beast.

As Luo Tian was shocked, the beast's horns pierced his front. He didn't delay, quickly retracting his fist and grabbing the horns with both hands.

The massive body retreated, leaving deep imprints on the ground. Luo Tian stepped back a hundred feet before stopping.

"Return!" He fixed his body and began to wrestle with the Soul-Subduing Beast.

Pounding sounds echoed, Luo Tian's arms bulging as he pushed the Soul-Subduing Beast forward.

"Roar..." The Soul-Subduing Beast roared, its gray eyes filled with shock. It hadn't expected to be pushed back. The Soul-Subduing Beast was an immortal entity in this city, and even if killed, it would regenerate after absorbing the spilled cultivation power.

"Too变态 (too powerful)! I heard our Saint Ye Qiu once dared not fight the Soul-Subduing Beast with his body, but used sword techniques and Jueyun Sword to cut it!" Seeing Luo Tian's actions, the Fengdu Palace disciples were stunned.

"Indeed, a man who killed Tian Gui King Duan Zijue and dominated the Ten Palace Competition!" Their eyes turned to reverence.

"Raise it!" Luo Tian roared, slowly lifting his arms and, under people's shock, lifted the mountain-like body of the Soul-Subduing Beast.

... A crash followed. The massive body was thrown to the ground, making the Soul-Subduing Beast emit a painful roar. Dust swirled; people far away could hear the sound of bones breaking, making them instinctively shiver.

"Too terrifying! I feel like I'm not even worthy of his finger碾 (crushing)!" Someone exclaimed, watching Luo Tian battle the Soul-Subduing Beast.

"Again!" Luo Tian laughed, his arms exerting more force to lift the Soul-Subduing Beast again.

The Soul-Subduing Beast wasn't a pushover; it suddenly kicked, ignoring Luo Tian's grip and aiming at him.

Luo Tian remained calm, releasing the Soul-Subduing Beast to avoid being kicked and then punched it in the head.

Crack... Another clear sound, this time a solid punch. The Soul-Subduing Beast's massive body fell to the ground, roaring in pain and sliding thousands of feet before stopping.

Luo Tian took a step forward, his body radiating overwhelming energy. The Soul-Subduing Beast swayed and stood up, its skull cracked, watching Luo Tian rush toward it. Without hesitation, it turned and ran.

"Even knows to run!" Luo Tian smiled, increasing his speed to chase the Soul-Subduing Beast.

The Soul-Subduing Beast's size didn't match its speed, but it was fast. However, Luo Tian was faster. He caught up with the Soul-Subduing Beast in no time and unleashed a flurry of punches, each hitting the beast's body.

"Roar..." The Soul-Subduing Beast roared, and each punch from Luo Tian made it roar again. This city seemed vast, but for Luo Tian and the Soul-Subduing Beast, it was too small to escape.

After an hour of chasing, the Soul-Subduing Beast couldn't endure and was shattered by Luo Tian's punch. A闷 sound echoed, the Soul-Subduing Beast roaring as it turned into swirling gray mist like a dark cloud, vanishing under Luo Tian's fist.

Chapter 2511: Huimai Wangliang ()

In the spacious city, gray clouds swirled. Luo Tian's eyes brightened; he could feel the gray mist contained powerful cultivation power. If absorbed, his strength would significantly improve.

"Defeated!" People stared in awe at Luo Tian returning to normal size, feeling his ferocity. They'd never heard of anyone defeating the Soul-Subduing Beast.

"Buzz..." As people marveled, Luo Tian began absorbing the abundant gray mist.

"These are cultivation powers! If I absorb all of it, I'll definitely advance to the Late True Immortal stage, even Half-Immortal!" A disciple of Late True Immortal stage said, envious as Luo Tian freely absorbed the cultivation power.

"The Soul-Subduing Beast is defeated, and this city's cultivation power has become much denser. Let's absorb it now!" They all sat cross-legged, beginning to absorb.

Of course, they dared not compete with Luo Tian; he took most of the power, while they could only absorb a little.

Joyful, Luo Tian's sole feeling was joy. He clearly felt his cultivation constantly rising. If this happened a few more times, he truly had hope to reach the Middle Immortal stage.

Time passed slowly; three hours later, Luo Tian opened his eyes, his gaze filled with light.

"This is truly a good place!" Luo Tian looked at the gradually thinning cultivation power in the air. For him, it was no longer useful. He walked toward another city gate.

Seeing Luo Tian leave, the hundred True Immortal disciples were overjoyed. The remaining cultivation power was nothing to Luo Tian, but it was significant for them.

"Quickly absorb! We'll follow him and definitely gain much benefit. I wonder how far he can go. I remember Ye Qiu Saint once passed four cities!" People discussed, their eyes filled with anticipation, greedily absorbing the cultivation power.

Luo Tian strode forward, exiting the first city and seeing the second city's location immediately. Without hesitation, he walked toward it.

As he walked, he clearly felt the cultivation power along this path was much denser than before. It was comparable to the first city before he defeated the Soul-Subduing Beast.

After an hour, Luo Tian saw a black city with a corroded gate and a fierce monster. It had four heads, but due to the age, the painting was unclear; Luo Tian couldn't recognize it.

"Is this thing in this city?" Luo Tian muttered, recalling the monster on the first city's gate.

Luo Tian pushed open the gate again; dense cultivation power made him feel at ease. The second city's sky had more souls.

The city's souls were also many, but they appeared much more painful than the first city's. Evidently, the punishment in this second city was harsher.

"Each level is more severe?" Luo Tian muttered, gazing at the gray mist. Though there was a diagram on the gate, he still wanted to see what kind of creature this one was.

Luo Tian strode forward toward the second city's center. After a while, another massive entity appeared in his view.

Four heads—tiger head, snake head, fish head, and eagle head—seeming to represent four types. The gray body radiated powerful pressure, making Luo Tian's face slightly change.

"Huimai Wangliang!" The name popped into Luo Tian's mind. He hadn't expected to encounter such a being.

Legends said Huimai Wangliang were the ancestors of ghost creatures; most ghosts in Hell were descendants of these.

Huimai Wangliang sounded like four ghost creatures, but they were one entity. Their physical strength and techniques were top-tier in Hell, comparable to the Black and White Judges. However, it had been years since such creatures appeared in Hell.

This one was obviously not the real Huimai Wangliang but a powerful beast formed from cultivation power.

"Roar..." The four heads roared, rushing toward Luo Tian upon seeing him.

"Fight!" Luo Tian smiled inwardly; this creature was just cultivation power. Defeating it would enhance his strength.

He unsheathed a blood sword, becoming a streak of light and rushing toward Huimai Wangliang.

"Roar..." Huimai Wangliang roared, emitting four voices of roar toward Luo Tian.

In an instant, the massive body reached Luo Tian's front. The tiger head roared with a king's aura, filling Luo Tian's mind and paralyzing him.
