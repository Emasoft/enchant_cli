It was because there were fewer Immortal King Realm disciples on their side; once they acted, Jiang Chen and Ke Duanshan would inevitably fight. But now it was different; they were the ones taking the initiative. When Chen Zhanbiao appeared, Wang Gang rushed out immediately.

„Who...“ Chen Zhanbiao stood there with his black tower-like body, not participating in the battle between Luo Tian and Yao Chen, but instead gazing toward the Hell side. He bellowed, but before he could finish his cry, he saw Wang Gang rushing out.

„Ah! Someone has arrived!“ Chen Zhanbiao's eyes gleamed with excitement as he looked at Wang Gang, his large eyes radiating a fierce glow.

„This young man seems tough!“ Chen Zhanbiao assessed Wang Gang, sensing a threat from him.

„Kill!“ Wang Gang growled. A black shadow rose behind him, and without a word, he charged toward Chen Zhanbiao.

„Hoo...“ A tiger's roar echoed as Wang Gang instantly attacked, his fist smashing toward Chen Zhanbiao.

„Good lad!“ Chen Zhanbiao's eyes lit up with excitement, shouting as he also launched a punch. His pot-bellied fist radiated an earth-shaking aura.

„Peng...“ A dull sound rose between them. Chen Zhanbiao took two steps back, while Wang Gang was sent flying a hundred feet.

„This hurts!“ Chen Zhanbiao looked at his fist, which bore several neat blood marks. His gaze shifted to Wang Gang.

„This flesh-and-blood body is no worse than Luo Tian's!“ Wang Gang's face showed shock. Though he seemed unharmed, his fist was gloved, while Chen Zhanbiao fought barehanded. He had gained the advantage but was now at a disadvantage.

„Again!“ Chen Zhanbiao leapt into the sky, reappearing before Wang Gang and launching another punch.

„I won't back down!“ Wang Gang gritted his teeth, unwilling to surrender. He also launched a punch toward Chen Zhanbiao.

This time, the result remained unchanged, but Wang Gang's lips bled slightly.

„My heavens! The Heavenly King was also spitting blood!“ The Hell side's people were stunned. Though Zhang Tianhe's defeat was understandable, Wang Gang was the new Heavenly King of the Beast Ghosts, an Immortal King at the initial stage. Besides the Ten Palace Saints' disciples and the Eight Heavenly Kings, who could match him? He was definitely among the top of the Immortal King initial stage.

„Drive away ghosts!“ Wang Gang, while retreating, waved his hands. He had finally understood that these people's flesh-and-blood bodies were变态 to the extreme, and close combat would only lead to his defeat.

„Hoo...“ As he retreated, a roar echoed from Wang Gang's front. A black giant tiger flew out before him, roaring toward Chen Zhanbiao.

„Ten Thousand Beasts Unbound!“ Wang Gang growled, his hands moving rapidly. A surge of ghostly energy instantly transformed into thousands of ghostly creatures, roaring toward Chen Zhanbiao.

„Is this a ghost?“ Chen Zhanbiao's eyes showed confusion as he gazed at the ghostly creatures, each radiating immense power.

„The Beast Ghost King used such a powerful technique so quickly!“

„This Ten Thousand Beasts Unbound is a heritage technique of the Beast Ghost King lineage. Its power is immense; each of these thousands of creatures is formidable, making it a killing technique!“ The Hell side's people murmured, clearly knowing the origin of this technique.

„Hehe, I wonder if it can eat!“ Chen Zhanbiao's eyes gleamed with light. He leapt into the air, his towering body rushing toward the thousands of ghostly creatures.

„Crack...“ In a flash, Chen Zhanbiao launched a punch at the first charging giant tiger.

„Ugh...“ The black tiger let out a groan, its massive body flying back, appearing on the verge of shattering.

„Boom...“ In an instant, the remaining ghostly creatures surrounded Chen Zhanbiao, their eerie ghost energy obscuring everyone's view.

„Play slowly!“ Wang Gang panted, continuously striking to maintain the number of ghostly creatures.

„He's trapped!“

„No wonder the Beast Ghost King!“ The Hell side's people rallied, watching Chen Zhanbiao who hadn't emerged. Though they didn't know his condition, the fact that he hadn't come out meant he was in bad shape. If he could have emerged, he would have.

„This Ten Thousand Beasts Unbound is a technique to exhaust the enemy. That big fool seems strong, but he's too fierce. Wang Gang's methods perfectly counter him!“ Wu Mian spoke.

„Sweep the eight directions!“ As people discussed, a thunderous roar echoed in their ears. After battling for so long, Yao Chen and Luo Tian had reached a fever pitch.

„Waves of heavenly might!“ Yao Chen's body radiated blood energy, his every hair glowing with divine light. His golden staff carried the might of heaven, shaking the sky as it swept toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly. He clenched his fists, sending out an invisible wave. His fist shot forward—Six Paths of Reincarnation.

In an instant, his black fist collided with Yao Chen's staff, which radiated immense power. The thunderous sound rose.

„Boom...“ Waves shattered, making Luo Tian's expression change. Still, he gritted his teeth and met the attack.

„What kind of power!“ Yao Chen's eyes showed shock, feeling Luo Tian's fist's strength. Yet he still refused to yield.

„Yao Chen, stop!“ Long Jie shouted, sensing Luo Tian and Yao Chen had both unleashed their full strength. If they continued fighting, it would lead to catastrophe.

„Huh?“ Hearing Long Jie's shout, Yao Chen regained a bit of reason. He forced back some strength.

With Yao Chen's power reduced, the six swirling patterns on Luo Tian's fist no longer shattered. Three remained and struck Yao Chen directly.

„Puk...“ Yao Chen flew back, his body emitting a series of cracking sounds. His massive form shrank until he stood still.

„Did you hold back?“ Luo Tian frowned, gazing at Yao Chen.

„I had fun. Let's fight again another day!“ Yao Chen wiped the blood from his mouth, stretched his body. His sunken chest began to recover as he flew toward the Tianhun City, acting as if nothing had happened.

„Victory without honor!“ Luo Tian sighed softly, watching Yao Chen return to Tianhun City. At that moment, his entire right arm was covered in cracks.

„If he hadn't held back, he wouldn’t have been so embarrassed!“ Luo Tian turned toward the Hell side's forces.

„Damn it!“ Jiang Chen's face darkened. He had also noticed Yao Chen had held back one part of his strength. Otherwise, the final result would have been uncertain.

„Now is the perfect time to destroy him!“ Jiang Chen's eyes flickered slightly. He felt Luo Tian’s current state wasn’t good either.

„Long Jie Elder, are you also going to help Bu Tian City?“ Jiang Chen's gaze turned toward Long Jie. At this moment, their side had only Long Jie and Ke Duanshan as Immortal King initial stage disciples. He wouldn’t use Ke Duanshan, leaving only Long Jie. Though he knew Long Jie was playing him, he guessed Long Jie wouldn’t overdo it. At least, he could injure Luo Tian like Yao Chen did. That would give their side a chance to fight back.

„Ah, that’s fine!“ Long Jie naturally knew Jiang Chen's plan. He smiled coldly and flew into the battlefield.

„Hell side, is there anyone else who can fight? Come out!“ Long Jie shouted, his aura soaring. He acted as if he were the top of the world.

„Too arrogant!“ The Hell side's people immediately stirred, gazing at Long Jie.

„I'll go!“ Wu Mian's cold voice echoed. He took a step forward toward the battlefield, but just as he moved, a hand grabbed him.

„General, you are the commander. How can you fight so easily? Let me go instead!“ An old voice echoed. A withered man in black robes stood before Wu Mian.

„Tianzun!“ Wu Mian was slightly stunned. He hadn’t expected Yang Wu to fight. He knew the Wheel Turning Sect had sent Yang Wu to establish a city defense array for Bu Tian City and the captured cities.

„Old man, I haven’t fought in a long time. Let me stretch!“ Yang Wu smiled as he flew into the battlefield.

„Tianzun, be careful!“ Wu Mian shouted loudly, giving a warning. Yang Wu was extremely important to the Wheel Turning Sect.

„Tianzun, the Tianzun himself has personally joined the battle!“ Seeing Yang Wu go out, the Hell side's people immediately trembled. Their eyes showed excitement.

„The Tianzun himself has joined the battle! That’s guaranteed to succeed!“ People murmured. The Eight Heavenly Kings held an extremely special position within the Wheel Turning Sect.

„It's a Tianzun, Hunshi Tianzun Yang Wu. He is an expert in arrays. Elder Long, you must take this old man down; it's extremely important for us!“ Jiang Chen’s eyes gleamed as he shouted at Long Jie.

„Don’t worry, everything is under control!“ Long Jie turned back and nodded.

„Old fool, take your life!“ Next moment, Long Jie moved. His aura was overwhelming, a king's presence radiating from him.

„So strong an aura!“ Everyone watched Long Jie’s overwhelming aura and immediately began to worry about Yang Wu.

Yang Wu saw Long Jie rushing toward him. He remained calm, took out a golden command flag and slowly waved it.

„Wind!“ Yang Wu coldly spoke. A violent storm instantly burst from the command flag, sweeping across heaven and earth toward Long Jie.

„Saint Dragon's Seal!“ Long Jie shouted, his hands moving rapidly. A golden dragon instantly flew out, radiating overwhelming waves toward the violent storm.

„Boom...“ Thunder rolled. In an instant, the golden dragon's seal collided with the violent storm. After a brief contact, the golden dragon’s seal shattered.

„The storm didn’t stop!“ It struck Long Jie, directly sending him flying. His body became a streak of light, colliding with the Tianhun City's wall.

„Puk...“ Blood spewed from Long Jie’s mouth, leaving blood marks on the wall.

Chapter 2529: Chaos Battle()

„I’m injured. Who is this person? He’s so strong!“ Long Jie weakly spoke. If Luo Tian hadn’t lost his memory, he would have marveled at how Long Jie had learned evil over the years.

Besides the thunderous sounds from where Chen Zhanbiao was surrounded by thousands of ghostly creatures, there were no other sounds. People looked in disbelief at Long Jie returning to Tianhun City, looking like he was about to die.

„Is the Hell Tianzun so terrifying?“ Everyone was puzzled. They hadn’t expected Long Jie, who had previously appeared so powerful, to be defeated in one strike.

„Hmm...“ Even Yang Wu was slightly stunned. He had clearly felt the opponent’s technique was strong.

„Haha, trash仙界 are all trash! The Tianzun is mighty!“ No matter what, the Hell side’s people cheered loudly.

„You really have become bad!“ Yao Chen shook his head, approaching Long Jie. He naturally could see that Long Jie was faking it. He extended a hand, sending waves onto Long Jie’s body.

„Boom...“ As people were shocked, thunderous sounds echoed across the battlefield. Black figures exploded, releasing powerful ghostly energy that swept in all directions.

„Hehe, it's fun. But I'm getting bored. None of them can eat...“ A series of silly laughs echoed as a black tower-like figure rushed out, instantly reaching Wang Gang and swinging his fist.

„How is this possible!“ Wang Gang regained his senses, eyes filled with disbelief. But before he could think further, he also launched a punch.

„Ten Thousand Beasts Unbound was broken! How did you do it? In an instant, nearly ten thousand ghostly creatures shattered!“ People gasped, gazing at Chen Zhanbiao colliding with Wang Gang.

„Crack...“ Wang Gang's body flew back, his fists emitting a series of cracking sounds. In the thunderous collision, Wang Gang was sent flying back by Chen Zhanbiao’s punch. Though he hadn’t suffered serious injuries, he had wounds.

„Attack!“ Almost immediately after Wang Gang returned, Wu Mian shouted and issued the attack order.

Now on Bu Tian City’s side, Yao Chen and Long Jie seemed unable to fight. But their side had formidable combat power.

„Damn it, everyone retreat! Follow me through the northern gate!“ As Wu Mian issued his command, Jiang Chen also cursed and shouted at Tianhun City’s people.

„In an instant, the battle reignited. A number of soldiers stationed in Tianhun City rushed out through the northern gate, engaging with the Hell army surrounding Tianhun City.

„Damn it!“ Jiang Chen cursed in his heart, feeling that Long Jie and others were just playing him. Though they had put in some effort, it was hardly effective. Especially Long Jie, who played too obviously.

„Crash...“ The people of Bu Tian City began to charge. War reignited, with tens of thousands fighting desperately against the northern gate of Tianhun City. Only by breaking through could they have a chance at survival.

Shouting and fighting filled the air. Wu Mian and Luo Tian watched this coldly. To them, the tens of thousands inside the city were insignificant. Jiang Chen and Ke Duanshan were the important targets. If they could kill these two, then Kanmen would be completely victorious.

Jiang Chen extended his hand. The Bu Tian Sword emitted a thousand-mile divine light, slicing toward the ghostly creatures and ghost disciples surrounding Bu Tian City. Instantly, a vast amount of blood mist and ghost energy rose. The golden sword light cleared the northern gate, allowing Bu Tian City’s people to charge through.

„You are Jiang Chen? Want to leave?“ As Jiang Chen just opened the exit, a loud laugh echoed. A scorching aura descended from above—Yu Tian stood up, his entire body engulfed in red flames. Jiang Chen's face turned serious.

„Fire Tianzun Yu Tian!“

„It really is impressive. They sent two Tianzuns!“ Jiang Chen spoke seriously, not expecting Yu Tian to have come for support.

„Kill...“ As he spoke, Jiang Chen flew into the sky and slashed toward Yu Tian with his golden long sword.

Jiang Chen had no choice but to fight. If he didn’t, Yu Tian would be even more dangerous. None of Bu Tian City’s soldiers could escape.

Two Immortal King middle stage disciples instantly soared into the sky, tearing through the heavens. They clashed in the void, with continuous ruptures and violent waves bursting out.

„Go! Break through!“ Long Jie shouted, showing no signs of his previous injuries. Behind him were Yao Chen and Chen Zhanbiao. The three charged like a supreme killer, leading Bu Tian City’s soldiers out.

Bu Tian City was the force of Bu Tian Mountain. Bu Tian Mountain had been kind to Luo Tian and Tianyuan Sect, so Long Jie couldn’t watch Bu Tian City be completely destroyed. His goal was to protect as many of Bu Tian City’s people as possible, provided he didn’t clash with Luo Tian.

But Long Jie's intentions were good, but the Hell side didn't think so. Wang Gang, Yang Wu, Luo Tian, and Zhang Tianhe blocked Long Jie's group.

„Want to leave? It’s not that easy!“ Wu Mian smiled coldly, standing in the sky and appearing before Bu Tian City’s people.

„Ke Duanshan, take the people out first. The rest is left to us!“ Long Jie spoke to Ke Duanshan, then rushed toward Luo Tian with Yao Chen and Chen Zhanbiao.

„Three people dare to block us? Who gave them the courage!“ Seeing Long Jie’s group rushing toward them, Wu Mian and others were surprised.

They admitted that Yao Chen and Chen Zhanbiao were strong, but it was unlikely they could block them.

„Wang Gang, Zhang Tianhe, you two rest. The rest is left to us!“ Wu Mian instructed everyone.

Wang Gang and Zhang Tianhe had just finished a battle, with injuries. Facing Long Jie’s group, they were helpless.

„Good!“ Zhang Tianhe and Wang Gang didn’t object. They flew back to the rear of the Hell side’s forces.

With their departure, Luo Tian, Du Tianming, Wu Mian, and Yang Wu stood there.

„Elder brother, I’ll take care of him. The rest you two can split!“ Long Jie spoke to Yao Chen and Chen Zhanbiao, rushing toward Luo Tian.

„That faceless fellow is mine. Zhanbiao, you can handle two of them, right? Remember, don’t kill them!“ Yao Chen spoke to Chen Zhanbiao. He had fought Luo Tian before and was somewhat exhausted.

„No problem!“ Chen Zhanbiao laughed, rushing toward Du Tianming and Yang Wu.

„Arrogant!“ Du Tianming coldly smiled, his sword light flashing. A shocking sword aura swept toward Chen Zhanbiao.

Yang Wu, however, rushed toward the battlefield to try and keep Ke Duanshan. If they could keep Ke Duanshan, the Hell army would completely crush the tens of thousands.

„Old man, don’t run!“ Seeing Yang Wu trying to leave, Chen Zhanbiao laughed and ignored Du Tianming’s sword light. He appeared in Yang Wu's path, launching a punch.

„Huh?“ Yang Wu’s face slightly changed. He took out his command flag again, summoning a storm toward Chen Zhanbiao.

„Boom...“ But this time Yang Wu wasn’t as smooth. Chen Zhanbiao launched a punch, taking two steps back. His arm had several wounds, making Chen Zhanbiao’s eyes show surprise.

„Old man, you’re strong!“ Chen Zhanbiao spoke gruffly. He took out his green hammer and swung it.

„Crack...“ The black sword light shattered under the green hammer, making Du Tianming’s face slightly change.

„Fengyu Lei Dian!“ Yang Wu shouted. Four array flags flew out, summoning a storm again. Black lightning and rain swept toward Chen Zhanbiao.

Chen Zhanbiao widened his eyes. His muscles trembled instinctively, sensing this storm could threaten him. But Chen Zhanbiao was a fierce type; he wouldn’t avoid unless it was Luo Tian or Xu Lizi. Even if the attack was strong, he would face it.

„Hum...“ A sound rose from the green hammer. Chen Zhanbiao roared, gradually lifting his green hammer.

„Break it open!“ With a roar, Chen Zhanbiao retaliated. Ten green hammers fell from the sky.

One... five...

A total of ten hammer images smashed into the storm sweeping across heaven and earth.

„Boom...“ Thunder rose. Black raindrops fell from the sky, with several black lightning bolts appearing in the heavens.

Yang Wu’s face changed. He looked at Chen Zhanbiao holding a hammer, surprised that he was so strong.

„Tenfold flesh-and-blood strength!“ Luo Tian’s face also showed surprise. He naturally recognized that Chen Zhanbiao was using the chaotic wind, which he also could use. Luo Tian knew how difficult it was to unleash tenfold flesh-and-blood strength.

„Elder brother, come back with us. We’ll find a way to restore your memory. Someone from home is already on the way here!“ Long Jie spoke, interrupting Luo Tian’s shock.

„What are you people?“

„I don’t care who you are. I am the Heaven Wheel Sect’s Saint Prince!“ Luo Tian flew into the air, rushing toward Long Jie. He knew he had to quickly deal with Long Jie; Yang Wu wasn’t Chen Zhanbiao’s match.

„Elder brother, I’m sorry!“ Long Jie moved his hands. A golden dragon transformed into a golden seal, pressing toward Luo Tian.

„Hun...“ Blood knife crossed the sky and collided with the golden dragon seal, making Luo Tian’s body slightly sink.

„Dragon Transformation!“ Long Jie growled. Knowing he couldn’t match Luo Tian one-on-one, since they hadn’t fought for years.

„Hoo...“ A golden dragon swept up, radiating divine light. Dragon aura was overwhelming. The golden dragon’s tail smashed toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian didn’t hesitate and slashed with his fist. The blood-colored knife light collided with the golden dragon’s tail, instantly leaving a blood mark on the tail. Several dragon scales fell from the sky.

This injury was nothing to Long Jie, who didn’t care. The dragon roar echoed again. He opened his mouth and spat out a golden dragon breath toward Luo Tian.

Chapter 2530: Jiang Chen's Transformation()

The golden dragon breath carried an earth-shaking aura, rushing toward Luo Tian. It collided with Luo Tian’s fist.

The thunderous sound echoed. The golden dragon breath was shattered by Luo Tian’s punch, with violent waves sweeping around Luo Tian's body. Luo Tian took a step back.

„This dragon was deliberately losing against the Tianzun!“ The Hell side’s people saw the golden dragon breath sending Luo Tian back and immediately realized.

„Why? Why did he deliberately lose? Now he’s blocking the Saint Prince!“ The Hell side's people were puzzled.

„Come here!“ Luo Tian extended his hand. A black giant hand suddenly stretched out, grabbing Long Jie.

„Peng...“ In an instant, the black hand grabbed the dragon’s tail. Luo Tian swung his arm, trying to spin Long Jie's massive body.

„Elder brother! I don’t want to be your enemy!“ Long Jie transmitted his voice toward Luo Tian. His entire body radiated golden divine laws, as if containing a shocking aura.

„Peng...“ The massive dragon body was smashed into the ground. Stones flew, but the golden dragon body seemed unaffected.

„A strong flesh-and-blood body!“ Luo Tian’s eyes showed surprise. But he still tightly gripped Long Jie.

„Hoo...“ The golden dragon head roared, emitting a king’s aura. Dragon roar shook the nine heavens, forming an invisible wave that surged upward.

With the dragon roar echoing, both people and ghostly creatures on the battlefield were stunned. Even Luo Tian, Wu Mian, and Yang Wu were slightly startled.

The golden dragon tail withdrew from Luo Tian’s grasp. It rushed toward Luo Tian, but before it could hit him, Long Jie slightly reduced his strength.

„Peng...“ A dull sound rose in front of Luo Tian. Luo Tian’s body flew back, but he only had a mark on his body.

On the other side, Chen Zhanbiao and Yao Chen’s attack didn’t stop.

„Old man, go back!“ Chen Zhanbiao swung his hammer and struck Yang Wu. He directly sent Yang Wu flying out of the void, spitting blood.

„Hehe, it's enough. We should leave!“ Yao Chen laughed and extended his golden staff. It struck Wu Mian, sending him flying back.

„Go!“ Long Jie’s massive eyes saw that Bu Tian City's people had already evacuated Tianhun City under Ke Duanshan’s leadership. His massive body coiled and flew toward the distance.

„Luo Tian, next time you must be ready!“ Yao Chen laughed and walked away as if strolling.

Chen Zhanbiao didn’t care about Du Tianming’s sword light. He laughed and followed Yao Chen and Long Jie, the three leaving in a hurry.

„Chase!“ Du Tianming’s face darkened. He moved his body and chased after Yao Chen's group.

„Don’t chase!“ Luo Tian grabbed Du Tianming back and spoke to him.

„They want to leave, we can’t stop them!“ Luo Tian sighed softly. It must be said that Long Jie’s group was the strongest he had ever seen. Even the Ten Palace Saints couldn’t match them, and Luo Tian felt Long Jie’s group was slightly stronger than the Ten Palace Saints.

„We still have a big fish!“ Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with light, gazing at the thundering void.

„Yes! There's still Jiang Chen!“ Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Du Tianming’s eyes gleamed with light. He extended his hand and tore open the sky.

„Everyone, retreat! Hold Tianhun City!“ Du Tianming shouted and rushed into the void.

Luo Tian also leapt into the void. As he entered, he immediately felt the heat of the void.

In the gray void, two figures continuously exchanged blows. Jiang Chen held a golden divine sword and constantly slashed through waves of fire.

„Leave!“ Jiang Chen, although in the void, also felt that Bu Tian City’s people had evacuated. Therefore, he had no intention of fighting and wanted to leave.

„You think it's that simple?“ But as Jiang Chen tried to leave, Du Jianxing blocked his path. Holding a black long sword, he rushed toward Jiang Chen.

„Damn it!“ Jiang Chen’s face slightly changed. He also saw Luo Tian rushing into the void and rushed toward Du Jianxing. If he didn’t leave now, he wouldn’t be able to.

„Black and white!“ The two sword tips precisely touched. Du Tianming’s black long sword instantly bent.

„Crash...“ In an instant, the black long sword turned into fragments and shattered before Du Tianming. The golden long sword pierced Du Tianming’s shoulder.

„Die!“ Jiang Chen's eyes showed ferocity. He extended another hand, drawing a long knife toward Du Tianming.

In an instant, Luo Tian also moved. His body became a blur and appeared before Du Tianming. He raised both hands, clamping the long knife.

„Luo Tian!“ Jiang Chen saw Luo Tian and immediately became furious. He withdrew the long sword piercing Du Tianming’s shoulder because behind him, a wave of fire was already rushing toward him.

„Go!“ Jiang Chen wanted to withdraw the long knife but found that Luo Tian’s hands didn’t move at all.

„I should have slapped you to death back then in Bu Tian City!“ Jiang Chen cursed under his breath and directly let go of the long knife.

„But it's too late!“ As Jiang Chen was about to overtake Luo Tian and escape, Luo Tian suddenly launched a punch toward Jiang Chen.

Jiang Chen had no choice but to block. He knew Luo Tian’s fist wasn’t easy to catch.

„Peng...“ Two fists collided. Jiang Chen and Luo Tian both took a step back, but Luo Tian pulled Du Tianming out of the void.

„Uncle Du, go back first. The rest is left to me!“ Luo Tian extended his hand and sent Du Tianming out of the void.

As soon as Luo Tian had sent Du Tianming out of the void, Yu Tian also clashed with Jiang Chen again. Fire swept across eight directions, infinite and endless, wrapping Jiang Chen. The two clashed continuously without either gaining the upper hand.

Luo Tian’s hands moved rapidly, and black whirlwinds appeared above their heads. A beast roared, and black ghost claws shattered the whirlwinds, smashing toward Jiang Chen.

„Damn it!“ Jiang Chen cursed. A sword energy shot out from above, causing an explosion. Though he blocked Luo Tian’s hellish ghost claws, his chest was struck by Yu Tian's palm, making Jiang Chen spit blood.

„Jiang Chen, surrender! You’re not our match!“ Yu Tian laughed and didn’t plan to kill Jiang Chen. A middle-stage Immortal King’s value was far greater alive than dead.

„Dream on! Just you two? Don’t push me!“ Jiang Chen laughed coldly. He spread the Bu Tian Sword Array, sending waves of sword energy toward Luo Tian and Yu Tian. This move had once trapped Luo Tian’s group.

„You can try self-destructing!“ Yu Tian's face showed a cold smile. He and Luo Tian could leave the void before Jiang Chen self-destructed.

„Do you think I would self-destruct?“ Jiang Chen also smiled coldly, his eyes flashing red.

„This is what you forced me to do. I didn’t want to go this far!“ Jiang Chen roared, his aura beginning to change slowly. Originally, the Bu Tian Mountain’s cultivation method was more gentle, but Jiang Chen's aura now began to turn ruthless and cold.

„Kill him!“ Luo Tian and Yu Tian felt the danger and immediately made a decision. Luo Tian flew into the air, rushing toward Jiang Chen with ten colors of fire rising and forming ten-colored dragons that rushed toward Jiang Chen before him.

„Flame Devours the World!“

„Eight Directions Inferno Array!“ Both shouted, and a thunderous fire instantly engulfed Jiang Chen.

„Luosheng...“ Jiang Chen’s aura became even more furious. His eyes had turned crimson, and waves of energy surged, as if he hadn’t felt Luo Tian and Yu Tian’s attacks. A low whisper echoed from Jiang Chen's mouth.

„Ah...“ Jiang Chen screamed in pain, grabbing his head. He was instantly engulfed by Luo Tian and Yu Tian’s fire.

The thunderous fire clung to Jiang Chen's body. Luo Tian and Yu Tian immediately appeared before him, each striking with a punch and a palm.

„Peng...“ Two punches and palms pierced through the fire, but Luo Tian and Yu Tian’s faces changed. They still maintained their attack positions.

„Luosheng...“ A low growl echoed from the fire. As this sound continued to echo, a cold aura gradually spread and suppressed Luo Tian and Yu Tian’s fire.

Luo Tian and Yu Tian felt their wrists grabbed by a cold hand, trying to break free but being tightly bound.

The fire gradually faded. A white hand grabbed Luo Tian’s wrist, and Jiang Chen's face was pale with a crimson gaze showing a touch of pain.

„You deceived me...“ A voice echoed from Jiang Chen’s mouth, then fell silent.

„Jiang Chen was possessed!“ Luo Tian and Yu Tian immediately realized, their eyes showing disbelief. The Immortal King Realm rarely had possession cases since they were recognized by the heavens and could draw on some of heaven's power.

„This sky...“ Crimson eyes gazed at the void, whispering lowly.

„Six Paths of Reincarnation!“ Luo Tian didn’t want to sit and wait, sensing that this “Jiang Chen” was no easy opponent. He immediately launched the Six Paths of Reincarnation.

„The power of the Six Paths of Reincarnation...“ Jiang Chen released his hand. Crimson eyes showed a touch of caution, but still grabbed Luo Tian’s palm with five fingers, each bearing five marks.

„Excellent!“

„He has reached such a level and even mastered a bit of the Six Paths of Reincarnation!“ Jiang Chen muttered, his hand touching Luo Tian’s overwhelming fist.

„Peng...“ The six whirlwinds shattered. Luo Tian's fist was caught in Jiang Chen’s hand, a cold aura making Luo Tian shiver.

As Luo Tian was shocked, waves of energy spread from Jiang Chen’s hands. A suction force directly affected Luo Tian and Yu Tian.

Chapter 2531: Luosheng Gate()

As the suction force spread, Luo Tian and Yu Tian could clearly feel their cultivation levels flowing toward Jiang Chen.

„What kind of technique is this!“ Luo Tian and Yu Tian were terrified. They hadn’t expected Jiang Chen to become so terrifying, capable of possessing a middle-stage Immortal King. Clearly, there was a powerful person inside Jiang Chen's body.

As their cultivation levels flowed away, Jiang Chen’s aura gradually rose. At the same time, his white hair began to grow longer, falling out as black hair emerged.

„We can’t continue like this! We’ll be drained by him!“ Yu Tian shouted at Luo Tian, trying to break free but being bound there.

„He’s only a middle-stage Immortal King, close to the late stage. Why is he so strong!“ Yu Tian shouted, looking at Jiang Chen.

„No choice!“ Luo Tian’s face darkened. He continuously thought about how to get through this crisis.

„I wish I had let Jiang Chen leave!“ Luo Tian and Yu Tian regretted. They knew now wasn’t the time for regrets, continuously circulating their cultivation to resist.

„I won’t back down!“ Luo Tian suddenly thought of a scene.

„Hun...“ As Luo Tian was at a loss, waves rose from his back. Red light flashed and entered Luo Tian’s body.

„Protecting the blade?“ Seeing Luo Tian's back, Jiang Chen frowned slightly.

„Young master, let me handle it!“ A voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind—Xue Zhu Tu Tian.

„Master, you’ve awakened?“ Luo Tian was surprised. He hadn’t expected Tu Tian to awaken now.

„Don’t resist, I’ll deal with him. He’s not as terrifying as you imagine!“ The voice of Xue Zhu echoed, red divine light entering Luo Tian’s body.

Luo Tian didn’t resist. He felt his body was taken over by Xue Zhu, slowly opening his eyes.

„Boom...“ In an instant, Luo Tian’s aura changed. His eyes turned red. He spoke two words.

„Let go!“ As he spoke, a blood-colored long sword appeared in Luo Tian’s hand. Accurately, it was Xue Zhu's hand. The blade glowed with a fierce aura and slashed toward Jiang Chen’s arm.

„Huh?“ Jiang Chen frowned slightly. He immediately released Luo Tian and Yu Tian.

„Who are you?“

„Are you the same as me?“ Jiang Chen spoke coldly, appearing ten zhang away from Luo Tian.

„Xue Zhu, Tu Tian!“ Luo Tian coldly spoke. He held the blood sword and suddenly slashed toward Jiang Chen.

The sound of a blade echoed, and the blood-colored blade energy sliced through space. It revealed the vast starry sky. The blade energy instantly appeared before Jiang Chen.

„Just you?“ Jiang Chen’s voice carried contempt. His Bu Tian Sword returned to his hand, radiating a cold glow.

„Who are you?“ Xue Zhu spoke. The thunderous blood energy surged, suppressing Luo Tian’s ghostly cultivation. Luo Tian turned completely red.

„Luosheng Gate, Jing Wu Ye!“ Jiang Chen boasted. His gaze turned toward Luo Tian.

„I don’t know you!“ Xue Zhu laughed coldly. He stepped on the ground, holding the blood sword and rushing toward Jiang Chen.
