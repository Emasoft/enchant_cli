“This is the Nascent Soul, the first prodigy of the蛮神殿!” Upon seeing the scene, Hu Tianzong could not help but exclaim in astonishment.

“If my guess is correct, their gathering must not be for the Yuanling Vein within this corner of the sea,” Lu Tian said, voicing his thoughts.

“You mean the Immortal Herb! It truly exists within the Tian断 Mountains!” Hu Tianzong’s face lit up with excitement, his gaze fixed ahead.

“It's very likely!” Lu Tian felt a surge of exhilaration. Regardless of the circumstances, there was a high probability that the Tian断 Mountains housed the Immortal Herb.

“A thorn in our back!” Lu Tian frowned, sensing four formidable auras behind him, murmuring softly.

“Indeed,” Hu Tianzong sighed, the Seven Star Island being isolated yet aware of the first prodigy of the蛮族, the Nascent Soul.

“That one, Tu Feiyang, we once fought before—he was a thorn in our side!” Lu Tian sighed softly. Due to the distance, he could not gauge their strength, but they were at least half-Epoch and likely all within the early Epoch.

“Speed up! We cannot match them in a direct clash!” Hu Tianzong urged Lu Tian, activating the Instant Movement Technique and vanishing from Lu Tian’s sight in an instant.

“Very well!” Lu Tian had no desire to confront them directly. His vast spiritual awareness enveloped both of them, while he also deployed the幽冥鬼步 (Shadow Ghost Step), his speed slightly slower than Hu Tianzong’s but not far behind.

“Hmph! Two little insects running so fast. Have they been discovered? I didn’t expect the human race to have two such talents!” The Nascent Soul displayed curiosity, his massive foot taking a step forward, his speed surging again.

“They won’t escape!” The other three clan prodigies also bore cold expressions, their speed surging another level as they pursued Lu Tian and Hu Tianzong.

Before the two groups met, their footwork clashed. One group dashed deep into the mountains while the other pursued like ravenous beasts, chasing after Lu Tian and Hu Tianzong.

Though both groups moved swiftly, the four clan prodigies were not particularly adept at speed. Thus, their distance did not shrink much.

Thunderous roars echoed continuously through the mountains. After a day of relentless running, both Lu Tian and Hu Tianzong’s faces grew increasingly grim. They had exerted their utmost, yet still failed to shake off the four behind them.

“Finally!” Hu Tianzong and Lu Tian halted, gazing at the boundless mountain ahead. Their eyes flickered with joy but quickly turned solemn, for they knew that if they had found the place, it was likely to meet the four clan prodigies. That would inevitably lead to a battle.

“Never mind, let’s go up first!” Lu Tian felt the thunderous roars from the mountain top and gritted his teeth, rushing toward it alongside Hu Tianzong.

“Squeak squeak…” But just as they stepped onto the blood-red mountain, they suddenly reversed direction.

Their speed increased even more, as if they had summoned all their strength, fearing they lacked two legs.

“Damn it! What’s going on!” Lu Tian cursed aloud, sensing the terrifying energy behind him and his eyes widened in disbelief.

“What’s going on? Two humans want to die themselves? They’re even heading toward us!” The Nascent Soul displayed confusion, then his expression darkened abruptly.

“Damn it! It’s the Bloodthirsty Magic Bats!” The Nascent Soul’s face turned grim, as if hearing the buzzing sounds. His massive body reversed and fled.

The other three also turned pale at his words, their expressions filled with terror as they dashed away.

But they were slightly too slow. Lu Tian and Hu Tianzong’s speed was astonishingly fast, and before they could react, they had caught up with the four.

“Damn you humans!” The Nascent Soul and Tu Feiyang’s hearts roared, their feet moving swiftly as they fled.

“Rush rush…” A sea of blood spread out endlessly, like a stormy wave, following the two. Countless blood-red bats, countless in number, chased after Lu Tian and Hu Tianzong.

As the two groups met unexpectedly, the Bloodthirsty Magic Bats targeted them, emitting a buzzing sound that made the four feel dizzy.

Lu Tian went mad. He knew if he were surrounded by these endless bats, he would not survive; the numbers were simply too overwhelming.

“Damn it! How could there be such things in the Tian断 Mountains!” All of them roared internally, running with all their might.

“Don’t panic. Use your spiritual awareness to envelop yourself and try to keep your aura hidden, lower your body temperature!” Tu Feiyang shouted as he stopped abruptly, standing like a statue.

“Effective!” Lu Tian observed Tu Feiyang and noticed that the bats did not attack him. He then stopped, his technique ceasing.

The others followed suit, and in an instant, the six of them stood like statues, staring at each other.

“Is it him!” Tu Feiyang fixed his stance and saw Lu Tian standing there as well, his eyes filled with disbelief.

“How could it be!” Tu Feiyang’s heart surged with waves. He never expected to meet Lu Tian here.

At the same time, Lu Tian also saw Tu Feiyang and the other three clan prodigies. His heart trembled.

“Early Epoch!” Lu Tian sensed their cultivation and felt a chill, then saw Hu Tianzong standing there with a grim expression.

“Once the Bloodthirsty Magic Bats disperse, you use the Instant Movement Technique to escape!” Lu Tian transmitted mentally to Hu Tianzong, indicating he should flee first. They two could not match the four early Epoch prodigies.

“What about you?” Hu Tianzong responded, his eyes filled with concern. In the face of all races, personal grudges were nothing; this was a tradition ingrained in the human race of Seven Star Island since birth.

“Flee, wait for me at the mountain entrance!” Lu Tian transmitted mentally to Hu Tianzong, his voice leaving no room for argument.

“Kid, I didn’t expect you to come here. How did you get in?” Tu Feiyang’s face bore a cold glint, his gaze fixed on Lu Tian.

“You don’t have the right to ask. Come if you want!” Lu Tian transmitted back, his eyes filled with disdain as he looked at the countless Bloodthirsty Magic Bats flying past.

“Good timing. Last time in a spiritual clash, this time I’ll see what you’re capable of!” Tu Feiyang’s face bore a cold expression, recalling the spiritual clash in the Dragon Fall Valley where he had lost to Lu Tian. It was his first defeat, and it was against a human, which he regarded as an eternal disgrace.

Chapter 1264: Retreat ()

The Tian断 Mountains, from a distance, appeared as countless palm-sized Bloodthirsty Magic Bats, like waves of blood flowing endlessly through the mountains.

Six people stood motionless like statues, exchanging thoughts with their spiritual awareness. The four clan prodigies looked down on Lu Tian and Hu Tianzong with disdain.

“I didn’t expect it to be you. With Guan Xingjian dead, have you become the first of Seven Star Island?” The Nascent Soul stood tall, his eyes filled with disdain as he gazed at Hu Tianzong.

“Only two humans. How should we divide them?” The four clan prodigies exchanged thoughts, waiting for the bat swarm to disperse before killing Lu Tian.

“That one is mine. I’ve fought him before!” Tu Feiyang directly selected Lu Tian, causing the others’ gazes to shift toward him.

They didn’t know who Lu Tian was. Though he was a half-Epoch, to them he was still nothing. They thought he was just Hu Tianzong’s subordinate. But Tu Feiyang directly choosing Lu Tian made them take him seriously.

“Who is he?” The three clan prodigies looked puzzled, asking Tu Feiyang.

“A old friend!” Tu Feiyang did not reveal Lu Tian’s origin from the Nine Domains. He wanted to capture Lu Tian and return him to the Blood Clan, uncovering why he could enter the Origin Domain. That way, they could gain an advantage by entering the Nine Domains early.

“I’ll take Hu Tianzong. One step and he’s dead, ending Seven Star Island’s generation!” The Nascent Soul transmitted to the three, directly pointing at Hu Tianzong.

“Then it’s settled. Take them!” Fu Xingyue and Fan Jingyu smiled, accepting.

“Rush rush…” The Bloodthirsty Magic Bats hovered around them for a full hour before disappearing. Yet, they remained motionless, not wanting to provoke the bats again.

After another hour, Lu Tian sensed the bats’ departure and transmitted mentally: “Go!”

“Buzz…” Upon hearing Lu Tian’s transmission, Hu Tianzong’s feet emitted waves of energy. In an instant, his body vanished from sight.

Lu Tian also disappeared like a ghostly figure toward another direction.

“Where do you think you’re going!” The Nascent Soul, upon Hu Tianzong’s disappearance, extended his massive foot and took a step of hundreds of feet toward where Hu Tianzong had fled.

“Speed’s peak? That’s why they couldn’t catch us!” Seeing Hu Tianzong’s speed, Fu Xingyue and Fan Jingyu displayed surprise. They looked at Lu Tian: “Can both of them master the peak of speed?”

“Kid, you haven’t improved much in half-Epoch!” Lu Tian’s speed was fast, but a streak of crimson light did not lag behind him. It instantly blocked Lu Tian’s path, its scarlet and strange eyes looking at him with disdain.

“Back then I could beat you. Now I can too!” Lu Tian, seeing he couldn’t escape, displayed a fierce expression. He looked at the two from the Fei clan and Xingyue clan, but made no move to attack. His eyes flashed with a golden light.

“Dadao Fuming, Fan Tian Attack, one power breaks all!” A thunderous sound echoed as Lu Tian unleashed his ultimate technique. His powerful body, combined with two supreme techniques, charged toward Tu Feiyang.

Lu Tian knew if the three attacked together, he had no chance to escape. But if it was just Tu Feiyang, he had a great opportunity to flee.

“Hmph?” Seeing Lu Tian’s punch, Fu Xingyue and Fan Jingyu displayed shock. They felt a deep sense of crisis from Lu Tian’s punch.

Who were they? Top prodigies within their clans, early Epoch strength. Yet, a half-Epoch human had made them feel crisis—something that had never happened before.

“Not simple!” They looked at Lu Tian cautiously, also wanting to see how Tu Feiyang would deal with this punch.

“Die!” Tu Feiyang, obviously arrogant, his blood-red runes flowed like serpents on his arms. They entered his fist with a clear sound.

“Crack…” Thunder surged, the thunderous sound shook the mountains around them. Dust and smoke filled the air as wild gusts of wind spread outward.

“Go!” Lu Tian coughed up blood, his body moving away without hesitation.

“Want to run?” Tu Feiyang saw his entire arm covered in cracks, a streak of blood flowing from his mouth. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

“He doesn’t just have one power breaking all!” Tu Feiyang’s eyes turned fierce. He moved swiftly, charging toward Lu Tian again.

“An attack technique! The peak of offense, combined with his powerful body. That’s why he can threaten us!” Fu Xingyue’s eyes, one like a full moon and the other like stars, looked at Lu Tian. He seemed to have discerned Lu Tian’s two supreme techniques.

“Two techniques, both rare treasures. Capture him and force out the two techniques!” Fu Xingyue’s face turned fierce, his body vanishing from sight.

“Ah! I see now!” Fan Jingyu’s face also showed a smile. His six wings emitted golden light, chasing after Lu Tian.

“Banshen’s wrath steps into the nine heavens!” As Lu Tian ran, a massive foot descended upon him.

“Banshen’s Seven Steps!” Lu Tian felt a chill and avoided the attack, his speed surging another level.

“Boom…” A mountain shattered under the foot’s impact. Rocks flew in all directions.

“Banshen’s Second Step Shatters Stars!” Before Lu Tian could catch his breath, the Nascent Soul’s voice echoed again in his ears. Lu Tian felt a chill.

“Hu Tianzong has escaped!” Seeing the Nascent Soul’s furious expression, Lu Tian knew Hu Tianzong had likely escaped.

“Nascent Soul! He’s my prey!” The divine power spread throughout Tu Feiyang. A streak of red light flashed in his hand, and a blood-red dragon surged forth toward Lu Tian.

The blood-red dragon roared as it reached Lu Tian’s back, the immense pressure causing his face to change.

“I can fight early Epochs in close combat. But I cannot withstand their techniques!” Lu Tian sighed, feeling a strong sense of crisis.

“Seven Star Shocking Magic Cauldron!” Lu Tian waved his hand, and a black cauldron appeared behind him.

At the same time, Lu Tian struck another Dadao Fuming punch toward the massive foot that had landed on his head.

“Boom…” Dust rose again. At the same time, the blood-red dragon collided with the Seven Star Shocking Magic Cauldron, producing a thunderous sound.

“Spit…” Cracks spread across Lu Tian’s body. Blood flowed from each crack, and he spat out blood, his face pale as a sheet.

“Boom…” But before Lu Tian could catch his breath, the black cauldron slammed into his back.

“Not dead? This kid’s body is strong!” The Nascent Soul displayed confusion, his gaze toward Lu Tian changing slightly.

“This kid can withstand it!” Fan Jingyu and Fu Xingyue, who arrived later, showed a solemn expression. Surviving the attacks of Tu Feiyang and the Nascent Soul, especially as a half-Epoch, was enough to make them take him seriously.

“I see how long you can endure! Tu Xian!” Tu Feiyang’s face bore a cold glint. His hands formed seals, and a furious aura surged from his body. Not being able to defeat this half-Epoch made Tu Feiyang feel a bit embarrassed.

“Banshen’s Third Step Shatters Heaven and Earth!” The Nascent Soul also did so, his eyes filled with anger. His massive foot extended again, covering the sky and earth like a vast heaven pressing down. The overwhelming aura made one feel suffocated.

“Go!” Lu Tian, shaken by the Seven Star Shocking Magic Cauldron, spat out more blood. But he used that powerful force to fly far away. He knew if he were hit again, even if he didn’t die, his blood would regenerate and his cultivation would drop. He would become a piece of meat on the chopping block, at their mercy.

“Spit…” Thinking about this, Lu Tian fully unleashed his blood essence. His speed surged again and he vanished from their sight.

“Rush rush…” Mountains of blood collapsed as the Nascent Soul’s massive foot crushed them. The blood-red dragon also pushed several mountains before disappearing completely.

“Damn it! I don’t believe he can escape this corner of the sea!” Tu Feiyang’s face was grim. He hadn’t expected to be chased away like this.

“Ah, this kid is a slippery eel. Don’t worry, he’s severely injured. This corner of the sea won’t open for another month. We have plenty of time to play with him!” Fan Jingyu smiled, addressing Tu Feiyang and the others.

Even among the ancient kings’ clans, there was competition. But when facing humans, they would unite against them, just like Seven Star Island.

Lu Tian felt more vulnerable than ever. But he had no choice but to keep biting his tongue, staying alert in the Tian断 Mountains while burning his blood essence.

In a life-or-death situation, Lu Tian unleashed endless potential. His speed reached its peak, surprising even Tu Feiyang and the four.

“Damn it! He really escaped!” The Nascent Soul’s face was grim. His massive foot stomped the ground twice, producing a thunderous sound.

“Never mind. Since we can’t find him, let’s first find the Purple Sky Divine Lotus!” Fan Jingyu spoke, his voice carrying a hint of resignation. A half-Epoch human escaping from the four of them was truly embarrassing.

Chapter 1265: Purple Sky Divine Lotus ()

Lu Tian dashed through the mountains, unprecedentedly desperate. He didn’t care where he was going; he rushed into any path without hesitation. After an hour of running, his body felt too weak to move. He stopped and took deep breaths, spreading out his spiritual awareness. He found no trace of Tu Feiyang and the others. His eyes flashed with coldness.

“Damn it! When I reach the early Epoch, I’ll beat you all to death!” Lu Tian cursed mentally. His eyes burned with anger before he grabbed a pill and swallowed it.

“Crack…” Just as Lu Tian had swallowed the pill, intending to recover his severely injured body, a streak of purple lightning struck down. It hit directly in front of him, creating a large crater.

“Damn it!” Lu Tian stood up abruptly. His spiritual awareness spread again, his eyes turning serious.

His eyes narrowed slightly, and he trembled inwardly. He muttered softly: “How did I end up here!”

Lu Tian only now realized he stood on a mountain ridge. This mountain ridge was none other than the one he had just entered and been chased out of by the Bloodthirsty Magic Bats.

“By mistake, I’ve returned here again!” Lu Tian’s expression turned serious. He gazed at the towering mountain peak, which stretched endlessly and was wrapped in a layer of purple mist.

Purple lightning occasionally shot out from the mist, striking the blood-red mountain and producing thunderous sounds.

“Thankfully, those Bloodthirsty Magic Bats have gone somewhere and haven’t returned. Otherwise, I would be dead for sure!” Lu Tian shook his head lightly and walked toward the mountain peak.

Lu Tian had no choice but to go up. He had entered this corner of the sea to find the Immortal Herb. Now that he was here, there was no reason not to seek it out. Moreover, if he returned now, he wasn’t sure whether he would meet Tu Feiyang and the others. If he did, he wouldn’t be able to withstand them. So Lu Tian had no choice but to ascend.

As for his injuries, he could only recover while walking. There was no other way. Fortunately, Lu Tian’s body had an incredible recovery rate. In a short time, his face had regained some color.

Lu Tian walked while dodging the purple lightning. As he climbed higher, the lightning became denser and more oppressive.

“Thousand feet… ten thousand feet…” Lu Tian kept climbing. After walking nearly ten miles, he finally stopped.

He had to stop because a powerful pressure descended upon his body. The purple lightning was also becoming denser.

At this moment, Lu Tian finally saw the mountain peak. His eyes widened in awe and he took a deep breath.

Visually, the blood-red mountain peak was like any other. The summit seemed flattened, like a high platform.

The purple mist that he had previously thought was mist turned out to be lightning. A vast sea of purple lightning covered the entire summit. Lu Tian could only see a glimpse of the scene within the purple lightning through his Purple Extreme Magic Eyes.

Lu Tian stared intently at the vast summit. His face turned red as he saw a purple lotus standing on an altar, as if bathed in the purple lightning. But more importantly, he felt that the purple lightning was emanating from the lotus itself.

“Immortal Herb! Purple Sky Divine Lotus!” Lu Tian was overjoyed. He hadn’t expected to find the Immortal Herb, which had been rare since ancient times. Lu Tian naturally recognized it. He hadn’t expected the Purple Sky Divine Lotus to be a complete plant, but its abundant vitality was masked by the purple lightning. He knew it must be a protective measure of the Purple Sky Divine Lotus.

“Powerful!” Lu Tian gazed at the intense purple divine lightning on the summit, his eyes filled with admiration.

He knew that to pick up the Purple Sky Divine Lotus, he would inevitably be subjected to this purple divine lightning. But his current state was poor. He felt a sense of crisis from the purple lightning, which was no less than the Heavenly Dao Lightning.

“Indeed! There is a Purple Sky Divine Lotus here!” As Lu Tian was thinking, a sound like a gong echoed in his ears. This made him determined.

“Nascent Soul!” Lu Tian didn’t need to guess who it was. He had no other choice but to continue moving forward, even though it was extremely dangerous. If he left now and met the four clan prodigies, he would be doomed.

“Seven Star Shocking Magic Cauldron!” Lu Tian waved his hand, using the recovered holy power to summon the Seven Star Shocking Magic Cauldron above him.

“Buzz…” The humming echoed. Seven black dragons emerged, swirling around his head. Their eyes emitted stars of light, protecting Lu Tian.

“Go!” Lu Tian gritted his teeth and took a step forward. He had no choice but to continue.

At first, Lu Tian was careful as he climbed upward, dodging the purple lightning. But with time passing and his distance to the summit decreasing, the purple lightning became denser and more frequent. It collided with the shield of the Seven Star Shocking Magic Cauldron, making Lu Tian feel astonished.

“Fortunately, I rented this cauldron before leaving!” Lu Tian shook his head lightly. His speed was gradually slowing, as the pressure increased. Even through the Seven Star Shocking Magic Cauldron, he felt heavy.

When Lu Tian had walked a certain distance, the Nascent Soul and Tu Feiyang also arrived at the spot where Lu Tian had hesitated. They faced the same problem as him.

“What do we do?” The four exchanged glances, looking at the purple lightning sea on the summit. Then they became excited because they had also discovered the Purple Sky Divine Lotus within it.

“Someone!” A moment later, Fan Jingyu coldly spoke. He saw the human walking through the lightning sea, protected by the Seven Star Shocking Magic Cauldron.

“It’s that human kid!” Tu Feiyang immediately recognized Lu Tian’s figure. Killing intent flashed in his eyes.

“Go! That kid dared to come here. Why can’t we?” The Nascent Soul led the way, his eyes turning blood-red. His massive body seemed cast in gold as he chased after Lu Tian.

“Go!” The other three also slowly followed Lu Tian. This lightning was dangerous for the injured Lu Tian, but for the four who had entered the early Epoch and whose bodies were comparable to the nine human races’ prime cultivations, it couldn’t cause too much harm.

“Fast!” Lu Tian felt four figures appear behind him. His face darkened.

But as he climbed higher, the pressure increased, gradually slowing down the four’s speed. However, they were slowly closing in on Lu Tian.

“What else can I do?” Lu Tian’s mind raced. He knew if he continued like this, he would eventually be caught by the four behind him. He thought desperately for a solution but realized that besides the Seven Star Shocking Magic Cauldron, he had only one other means: a fragment of the Epoch Book.

“Fragment of the Epoch Book?” Lu Tian thought about his rusted fragment of the Epoch Book. His eyes showed contemplation.

“This lightning is a supreme yang force. Perhaps it could help with the rust!” Lu Tian sighed inwardly. He had no other choice. If he could restore the fragment of the Epoch Book, using the Eight Directions’ Treasure-Grabbing Technique would allow him to crush all enemies. This was Lu Tian’s confidence in the Epoch Book.

“Let me try! It's better than waiting to die!” Lu Tian grabbed the rusted fragment of the Epoch Book from his storage bag.

“Rush rush…” Lu Tian trembled as he watched the purple lightning striking the Seven Star Shocking Magic Cauldron. He carefully sent the fragment of the Epoch Book into the purple lightning.

In an instant, the purple lightning struck the golden fragment. White smoke rose from the Epoch Book.

“Roar…” Lu Tian felt as if something was howling. The dense purple lightning struck it, turning into white smoke that dispersed.

But the next moment, Lu Tian shook his head. He felt dizzy and as if he had a hallucination.

Then an astonishing scene occurred: the Epoch Book, under the refinement of the purple lightning, produced more and more white smoke. It quickly spread across the entire summit. The white mist turned black, completely obscuring Lu Tian’s vision. Even with his Purple Extreme Magic Eyes open, he couldn’t see the surroundings.

“What is this?” The Nascent Soul and Tu Feiyang also became enveloped by the black mist. Their eyes showed panic. This was their first time experiencing such a thing.

“Roar…” A low roar echoed, sending an icy chill through them. They instinctively shivered.

“I think I’ve done something wrong,” Lu Tian felt a chill in his body. He looked at the black mist, feeling it could swallow him.

“Buzz…” As Lu Tian felt cold all over, a streak of purple lightning struck down like the end of days. A purple lotus floated up slowly, appearing in Lu Tian and the four’s sight.

At the same time, a golden paper burst out with brilliant gold light. It rose slowly, no longer ordinary. It seemed to suppress everything. Golden light spread out from the golden paper.

Chapter 1266: Epoch’s Trial ()

The black mist enveloped the entire summit. A golden paper and a purple lotus rose from the mist. The golden light swept across, dispelling the black mist that had made them feel extremely cold.

“Boom boom…” Thunderous sounds echoed. Purple lightning surged from the purple lotus, forming a geyser of purple lightning that spread outward.

“Roar…” A terrifying roar echoed in Lu Tian and the four’s ears. Even the Nascent Soul and Tu Feiyang felt this sound was powerful, as if a demon had emerged from the endless abyss. It made them fear.

“What is this thing!” They stood stunned, watching the black mist being annihilated by the Epoch Book and purple lightning. Their minds were filled with great confusion.

“Buzz…” When the last bit of darkness disappeared, the summit seemed to return to normal. Lu Tian and the four sighed in relief.

Then their eyes turned unfriendly toward Lu Tian, charging at him through the purple lightning.

“Die!” The Nascent Soul roared and waved his hand. A white wolf staff appeared in his hands, which he swung toward Lu Tian.

Tu Feiyang summoned a strange curved sword. He waved his hand, and the sword spun rapidly, emitting divine light that slashed toward Lu Tian.

“Golden Feather Sword!” Fan Jingyu of the Fei clan also finally attacked. White feathers transformed into golden divine swords, merging into a sword of opening the heavens that charged toward Lu Tian.

“Star Moon Divine Spear!” A green spear was summoned by Fu Xingyue, charging toward Lu Tian.

Each of the four weapons was powerful. Each strike was a killing blow. They were beyond pseudo-Epoch treasures and had connections with the ancient kings. The ancient kings were as powerful as the human race’s Epoch Masters. Weapons connected to them had unimaginable power.

“Damn it!” Lu Tian’s face trembled instantly. He saw the four weapons, which had passed through the purple lightning, charging toward him. His eyes turned wild.

“Eight Directions’ Treasure-Grabbing Technique!” Lu Tian roared, each word spoken with intensity. His eyes turned blood-red. Veins bulged on his arms as he grabbed the air with both hands.

The sound of battle erupted. Strange waves formed invisible gusts from Lu Tian’s hands, rushing into the four supreme weapons with his powerful spiritual awareness.

Then an unforgettable scene occurred for Tu Feiyang and the four. The sight before them exceeded their comprehension.

The four supreme weapons, as if no longer under their control, emitted a sound of struggle. They crashed to the blood-red mountain with thunderous sounds.

“Cough cough…” Lu Tian coughed up more blood, breathing heavily. His eyes showed excitement as he looked at the four weapons that had fallen to the ground.

A dazed feeling returned to Lu Tian’s mind. He was exhausted from using so many techniques in a row.

“What is this martial art!” The four looked at him with disbelief. They had never imagined such a technique could stop the attacks of four supreme weapons.

“What does it matter? This astonishing martial art must have consumed a lot. With his frail body, he has become a weakling. I can crush him with one finger!” The Nascent Soul displayed disdain, looking at Lu Tian who stood trembling. His massive body took a step forward toward Lu Tian.

“Buzz…” But as the Nascent Soul moved, a streak of golden light flew up. It flashed and instantly appeared beside the Purple Sky Divine Lotus. Without the previous unity to suppress the black mist, it now aimed its sword at the Purple Sky Divine Lotus. The golden paper transformed into a sharp blade and slashed at the lotus’s stem.

Purple lightning struck again, even more furious. A streak of purple lightning formed a root and severed the Purple Sky Divine Lotus’s stem, causing it to float up from the altar.

“Don’t mind that kid. First, take the Purple Sky Divine Lotus. The herb is alive and it’s trying to escape!” Tu Feiyang and the others saw this situation. They no longer cared about Lu Tian, rushing toward the Purple Sky Divine Lotus.

But one figure was faster. Bathed in purple lightning, it instantly appeared beside the Purple Sky Divine Lotus. His pale hands grabbed the lotus before it could flee.

“Thank you!” Lu Tian spoke to the Epoch Book hovering on the altar. His pale face turned red as he grabbed the Purple Sky Divine Lotus, feeling a surge of vitality rushing into his body.

“You should die!” The Nascent Soul roared and launched another Ban Shen’s Seven Steps, crushing toward Lu Tian.

The other three also displayed wild killing intent. This Immortal Herb was priceless, comparable to an Epoch Treasure. It could allow the Epoch Master to live a second life. Precious beyond measure, it was right in front of them, within reach. How could they let go of Lu Tian? In an instant, their killing intent was everywhere as the four unleashed their ultimate techniques toward Lu Tian.

A single drop of purple liquid, glowing with a soft light, fell on Lu Tian’s body. His injuries healed instantly. His eyes showed coldness.

“Eight Directions’ Treasure-Grabbing Technique!” Lu Tian pointed his finger, and the golden fragment of the Epoch Book suddenly expanded. It stood before him.

“Boom boom…” The entire blood-red mountain, having lost the Purple Sky Divine Lotus, seemed to lose its former strength. It shattered into countless blood-red fragments, floating in their sight.

“Amazing! He has blocked it!” The four were astonished. They looked at the golden book fragment emitting brilliant gold light before Lu Tian. Though it seemed as thin as a cicada’s wing, they had never expected it to block their attacks.

“Since you are so aggressive, don’t blame me for being ruthless!” Lu Tian stood behind the Epoch Book. His face showed coldness as he surveyed the four, then his aura surged.

“I had planned to prepare more, but time seems insufficient!” Lu Tian looked at the blood-red sky. His eyes gradually became determined.

At the moment his aura rose, the blood-red sky was filled with dark clouds. A terrifying pressure instantly descended upon them.
