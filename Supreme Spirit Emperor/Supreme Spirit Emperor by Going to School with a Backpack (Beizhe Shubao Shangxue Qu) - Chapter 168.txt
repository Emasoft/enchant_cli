“Luo Tian... damned Luo Tian!” Jin Yonglin, fleeing, felt the thunderous roar behind him. His face showed a look of despair as he spat out blood, regaining his cultivation. His slowing speed suddenly surged again.

Jin Yonglin was severely wounded; even if he survived this time, his cultivation would drop to six sources or lower! But Jin Yonglin had no choice; the figure behind him, Luo Tian, was like a fierce tiger, forcing him to fight desperately.

“Three thousand zhang... two thousand zhang... one thousand zhang…” Jin Yonglin’s face lit up with joy. The Supreme Altar was getting closer, and he could already see the vague figures seated upon it. Yet Luo Tian’s distance was closing in.

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed coldly as he hurled the Splitting Heaven Spear. Original Power surged, and with a mighty throw, seven-colored original power imbued the spear. It emitted a resonant hum and instantly appeared behind Jin Yonglin.

Afraid Jin Yonglin might evade, Luo Tian cast a hand sign simultaneously. A terrifying force of heaven and earth surged forth, original power forming an arrow that followed the spear toward Jin Yonglin.

“Ah…” Jin Yonglin seemed to go mad, burning all his remaining blood and energy, leaving only two drops for survival. He unleashed them fully.

“Plop… plop…” Two sounds echoed from Jin Yonglin’s body as the original power arrow pierced his shoulder, and the Splitting Heaven Spear stabbed into his abdomen.

In the blink of an eye, Jin Yonglin’s body reached the Supreme Altar, pinned there by the spear. Blood splattered onto the vast altar.

“Roar…” Jin Yonglin roared, and as the spear pierced his abdomen and dantian, his entire cultivation vanished into nothingness.

At the same time, Luo Tian’s figure appeared before Jin Yonglin. His hands emitted a powerful suction, forcibly extracting Jin Yonglin’s three soul fragments and clutching them.

“You dare…” Jin Yousi, seated on the altar, coldly gazed at Luo Tian and shouted.

Jin Yousi had already received Jin Yonglin’s plea, but now he was on the Supreme Altar and couldn’t leave. Sha Cangmang had arrived earlier, and if Sha Cangmang entered the Nine Sources Supreme class beforehand, it would be detrimental to both Jin Yousi and Ke Zhen Tian.

Seeing his brother in such a pitiful state, Jin Yousi’s heart felt like it was being cut. His face showed madness as he glared at Luo Tian with icy killing intent.

As Jin Yousi shouted, Ke Zhen Tian, Sha Cangmang, and the other thirteen people brought by Sha Cangmang onto the Supreme Altar slowly opened their eyes. When they saw Luo Tian, their faces changed.

“Unexpectedly, even when facing two Nine Sources Supremes, this kid still found a chance to survive. Truly not simple!” Sha Cangmang was shocked, his eyes filled with astonishment as he watched Luo Tian standing beneath the altar, holding Jin Yonglin’s three soul fragments.

“His power surpasses ours!” The others’ faces were also shocked, gazing at Luo Tian.

Jin Yonglin’s strength was stronger than theirs. They couldn’t imagine what would happen if they met Luo Tian.

“Only a few years have passed, and he’s grown from an attendant of the World Rank to a Seven Sources Supreme. His original power is formidable. This kid is truly terrifying!” Ke Zhen Tian’s face showed a grim expression.

Hearing Jin Yousi’s words, Luo Tian smiled: “There is nothing I, Luo Tian, dare not do. Did you ever think of this day when you wanted to kill me!”

Luo Tian’s eyes flashed coldly. He scanned the dozens of people on the altar before tossing Jin Yonglin’s howling soul fragments into the air.

“Roar…” Several残魂 comparable to Eight Sources Supremes roared wildly, rushing toward Jin Yonglin’s soul fragments as if they were food.

A Seven Sources Supreme Master who once shook the Four Sacred Star Regions with a single roar, now lay defeated.

“You should die!” Jin Yonglin’s eyes nearly burst as he glared at Luo Tian, wanting to devour him alive.

“Why do you want to kill me? Come down and fight with me!” Luo Tian’s eyes burned with battle spirit, gazing at Jin Yousi with disdain.

Jin Yousi trembled all over. His aura fluctuated constantly. Jin Yousi was his younger brother, and after so long of cultivation, all their family had died. Only they two brothers remained. Moreover, Jin Yonglin was a spy in the Blue Dragon Sect. This made Jin Yousi feel guilty toward his brother. He had planned to return to the White Tiger Sect and make amends, but now Luo Tian had killed Jin Yonglin before his eyes.

If it weren’t for the temptation of the Supreme Altar, Jin Yousi would have descended from the altar to fight Luo Tian to the death.

“Yonglin, rest assured. Once I achieve Supreme, I will find a way to revive you!” Jin Yousi whispered to himself before closing his eyes again, beginning to cultivate.

At the same time, Luo Tian pulled out the Splitting Heaven Spear and burned Jin Yonglin’s body with a casual wave. A smile crossed his face as he leaped onto the Supreme Altar.

“Peng…” Heavy footsteps landed on the altar, its inscriptions glowing and flowing continuously.

“You’ve come up! How about it, Jin Yousi? Want to fight me on this Supreme Altar?” Luo Tian called out to Jin Yousi, but received only silence.

“Never mind. It’s not interesting!” Luo Tian found a spot, sat cross-legged, and closed his eyes. Suddenly, his eyes widened in shock as he muttered: “The Book of Epochs!”

Chapter 794: The Supreme Chapter()

On the Supreme Altar of the Divine Realm, a dozen figures sat around it, their faces solemn.

Luo Tian gazed at Sha Cangmang and others seated on the altar, his eyes filled with shock. As he had just closed his eyes to cultivate, a familiar fluctuation appeared in his perception. A string of information rushed into his mind, shaking him deeply.

“Supreme Chapter!” Messages flooded Luo Tian’s mind. The most shocking part was the source of that familiar feeling.

The Book of Epochs, this artifact had changed Luo Tian’s fate. He never imagined it would appear in the Divine Realm.

But Luo Tian knew this altar wasn’t the entire Book of Epochs, but merely a page from it.

“Could it be that the Book of Epochs in Tianyuan was incomplete, with more chapters to come?”

“It shouldn’t be wrong. But why is it here in the Divine Realm?” Luo Tian’s mind filled with confusion, unable to find an answer.

“Regardless, it's more important to enhance my strength now!” Luo Tian sighed, knowing it wasn’t the time for questions. He closed his eyes again and began to cultivate.

The altar remained quiet, and Luo Tian fell into cultivation. Everyone’s faces were calm, their bodies emitting slight fluctuations. The altar shimmered with light, and countless inscriptions flowed like serpents around them.

Time passed slowly. After five days, someone moved first—Sha Cangmang, the earliest to reach the Supreme Altar. He opened his eyes, and two lightning bolts seemed to ignite in the void.

The powerful残魂 surrounding the altar trembled, spreading waves of shock outward.

Sha Cangmang stood up, his face filled with joy. He gazed at the sky, and the entire world turned dark as heavenly power rushed into his body.

“Not bad. Just a few days of cultivation, and I’ve achieved Nine Sources!” Sha Cangmang’s face showed a hint of reluctance.

“Time is about up. If we don’t leave soon, we might not be able to escape!” Sha Cangmang muttered, looking at the others.

His gaze finally landed on Jin Yousi and Ke Zhen Tian. His eyes flashed with coldness, but he quickly suppressed it.

Feeling Sha Cangmang’s gaze, Jin Yousi and Ke Zhen Tian both opened their eyes. They stood up like Sha Cangmang, and the world trembled again with a powerful fluctuation. The heavenly power of the entire Divine Realm seemed to be drained, rushing into their bodies.

Nine-colored original power flowed around them.

“Sha Cangmang, want to spar?” Jin Yousi smiled, his voice filled with endless battle spirit.

“No interest!” Sha Cangmang shook his head. His strength had already surpassed Jin Yousi before, and even now at Nine Sources, he was confident Jin Yousi still couldn’t match him.

Seeing Sha Cangmang’s disdainful gaze, Jin Yousi gritted his teeth but didn’t act rashly. He stood on the altar, finally directing his gaze at Luo Tian with boundless killing intent.

The thunderous sound continued. The Blue Dragon Sect members seated on the altar also opened their eyes one by one, their faces showing regret. The time was too short; within five days, everyone had advanced by one source.

“Years of planning haven’t been in vain. Although I didn’t complete the cultivation, advancing to Eight Sources is already remarkable!”

“Next time we come, we should be able to reach Nine Sources!” Dou Jiande and others showed anticipation. Now that they knew the method, only waiting for their next chance to enter.

At the same time, people turned their eyes toward Sha Cangmang and the others. Their faces showed astonishment at seeing Nine Sources Supremes, the top of the Four Sacred Star Regions. For years, besides the Nine Sources Supreme of Xuanwu Sect, Dou Jiande and others had never seen a Nine Sources Supreme.

“Next time we enter, when the Sect Leader reaches the Supreme level, it will be our Blue Dragon Sect’s rise!” The Blue Dragon Sect members smiled, whispering among themselves.

Finally, everyone focused on Luo Tian seated cross-legged and calm. As people gazed at him, he slowly opened his eyes. Though his cultivation time was shorter than others, when he stood up, his aura radiated Eight Sources Supreme, leaving people in awe.

“Indeed a genius. In such a short time, he’s reached the eighth source of the Dao!” People marveled but didn’t show it.

Because as soon as Luo Tian opened his eyes, a sky-shattering rainbow shot toward him.

“Jin Yousi!” Luo Tian sat on the altar, watching the nine-source power forming a rainbow. He smiled coldly and pointed his finger.

“This kid is really crazy, daring to challenge Nine Sources with only Eight!” People showed a hint of surprise, gazing at Luo Tian’s calm face.

The thunderous sound echoed in their ears, shaking those who had just advanced to Seven Sources. Their minds rang with a continuous buzz.

“Kid, you must die!” Jin Yousi’s face showed surprise before understanding. Luo Tian's strength was truly terrifying—Blue Dragon Body combined with eight Dao sources, his power completely overpowered Jin Yousi’s previous Eight Sources.

“Advancing to Eight Sources, what good is it? I am now Nine Sources! Killing you is like killing a chicken!” Jin Yousi’s killing intent was unhidden. He pushed off the ground, his body instantly appearing before Luo Tian. A punch shot out, with a tiger’s roar echoing in the fist. The powerful fluctuation made Luo Tian, who had just stood up, show a grim expression.

“I’ll see if Nine Sources can do anything to me!” Luo Tian’s eyes burned with battle spirit. Just as Jin Yousi thought, Luo Tian's current strength was fearless of Nine Sources. Even if he couldn’t defeat Jin Yousi, he could escape easily.

He clenched his fist, eight original powers凝聚ing. His powerful body was surrounded by green qi. He punched out again, colliding with Jin Yousi.

Their fists collided fiercely. One strike caused the sky to twist, lightning flashing. A green dragon and a white tiger’s shadow clashed violently.

After the collision, both men retreated, becoming streaks of light at the altar’s edge.

“Old Ke, time is tight. Let’s finish this kid together!” Jin Yousi estimated the time and called out to Ke Zhen Tian.

“Good!” Ke Zhen Tian didn’t hesitate. They were now allies, and this favor had to be returned. Ke Zhen Tian made a hand sign, the sound of phoenix cries echoed, and a nine-source power-formed phoenix emerged from the void. It radiated an intense heat capable of burning everything, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Two of them?” Luo Tian’s face changed. Facing two attacks, he dared not fight directly. His feet sent out a fluctuation, and his body vanished from the Supreme Altar, appearing among the countless残魂 below.

“Chase!” Jin Yousi’s killing intent had reached its peak. Killing his brother was a grudge that couldn’t be forgiven. Without hesitation, he vanished from the arena.

At the same time, Ke Zhen Tian pointed his finger. The phoenix changed direction, let out a cry, and countless flames fell toward Luo Tian who had stopped. His body also rushed down from the Supreme Altar.

“Kid, I said you’d die no matter where you ran!” Jin Yousi didn’t think twice. His hands changed, and a silver spear appeared in his hand.

“Now it’s your turn to run!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with killing intent. In his hand, instead of the Splitting Heaven Spear, a soul banner appeared.

“Roar…” As Luo Tian revealed the soul banner, all the残魂 in the Divine Realm roared. They rushed toward him with wild excitement, even some残魂 were comparable to Nine Sources.

Countless残魂 surged into people’s vision, filling the world. Their faces showed warmth and wildness as they gazed at Luo Tian.

“What’s going on!” Jin Yousi and Ke Zhen Tian were shocked, staring at the rushing残魂.

Not only Jin Yousi and Ke Zhen Tian were shocked, but even Sha Cangmang and others on the Supreme Altar showed shock. They stared at the terrifying残魂.

“Go! My ancestors of Tianyuan, destroy these two!” Luo Tian’s face showed warmth. He waved his soul banner gently and coldly gazed at Jin Yousi and Ke Zhen Tian.

As Luo Tian’s words ended, countless残魂 roared. Filled with strong hostility, they rushed toward Jin Yousi and Ke Zhen Tian under the guidance of several Nine Sources残魂.

“Even these nine-source残魂 are troublesome. Imagine what would happen if there were hundreds or thousands of seven and eight-source残魂! It’s possible Jin Yousi and Ke Zhen Tian might die here!”

“Not only that, but countless Supreme-level残魂 are also rushing toward this place. Ordinary people couldn’t escape at all!” The Blue Dragon Sect members on the altar showed admiration, looking at Luo Tian in disbelief. They hadn’t expected him to have such a secret weapon.

Chapter 795: The Conditions for Leaving()

On the Supreme Altar, countless残魂 continuously roared toward Jin Yousi and Ke Zhen Tian. They seemed to have no regard for life, as if Luo Tian was their master.

Jin Yousi and Ke Zhen Tian’s faces were grim. Their bodies emitted powerful fluctuations, but the残魂 seemed unaffected. Even if they turned to ashes, they would reform instantly, proving they were the true masters of this Divine Realm.

“Why can he control these souls! How is this possible!” Jin Yousi’s face showed madness. Facing so many残魂, even with his Nine Sources strength and Ke Zhen Tian’s alliance, they were no match. They could only endure desperately.

Luo Tian showed a gentle expression: “Thank you,前辈 spirits. My promise will be fulfilled!”

After speaking, Luo Tian transformed into a thunderous sound and rushed toward Jin Yousi. Countless残魂 attached to his body, enhancing his strength to a level comparable to Nine Sources.

With thunderous power, Luo Tian’s fist slammed toward Jin Yousi. The sound of the collision was overwhelming, turning the sky into eight colors of original power.

Seeing Luo Tian rushing toward him, Jin Yousi’s face changed. His eyes were wild as he fought against several Nine Sources残魂 while making a hand sign. A white tiger’s image appeared, as real as flesh and blood, roaring toward Luo Tian.

“Get out…” Luo Tian didn’t stop. He raised his fist and collided with the real white tiger.

The sky twisted, and the stable space of the Divine Realm cracked under their collision. The cracks spread outward.

Luo Tian’s fist shattered the white tiger’s shadow, and his body instantly appeared before Jin Yousi. Without hesitation, he punched again.

“Roar…” Jin Yonglin was clearly pushed to his limits. Feeling the threat Luo Tian brought, he unleashed his original power, burning it for a brief enhancement. He punched out.

Lightning surged as Jin Yonglin’s face grimaced, his body uncontrollably retreating. His body collided with the Supreme Altar.

Luo Tian’s face showed a smile, a sense of joy rising in his heart. This was the first time he had injured Jin Yousi, giving him great confidence. Green light flashed as he rushed toward Jin Yousi again and punched... two punches... three punches...

In a short time, Luo Tian delivered eight punches. These were his full-force strikes. Even without the残魂’s attacks, Jin Yousi would have been wary of them. Now, with those powerful残魂 entangling him and leaving him in a pitiful state, it was unexpected that he had no time to deal with Luo Tian’s attacks.

“Peng… peng…” Punch after punch landed on Jin Yousi, causing him to spit blood. His body, just recovering slightly, collided again with the Supreme Altar, leaving those on the altar in awe.

Jin Yousi was one of the Four Great Bosses, a major power in the Four Sacred Star Regions. When had he ever suffered such a loss? When had he been defeated by a young man before? Except for the time when he dueled Sha Cangmang and received a minor injury, Jin Yousi had never been so pitiful.

“Not good. In the Divine Realm, I can’t match this kid. With so many残魂, there’s no need for him to act directly; I’ll be exhausted within half an hour!” Jin Yonglin’s face showed a fierce expression, his veins bulging. He had already planned to escape.

Ke Zhen Tian was also in a pitiful state. Seeing Jin Yousi, who was even more pitiful, Ke Zhen Tian’s mouth twitched. He also felt like retreating. In the Divine Realm, Luo Tian, who could control souls, was an unbeatable force. Even with Sha Cangmang’s help, three people together wouldn’t match Luo Tian.

Bitterness filled Jin Yousi and Ke Zhen Tian. They had never felt such bitterness before.

“Luo Tian… remember, as long as you appear in the Four Sacred Star Regions, you will die!” Jin Yousi forced down his injuries. He glared at Luo Tian and exchanged a glance with Ke Zhen Tian. His original power burned completely, and the two transformed into streaks of light, as if slicing through space toward the exit.

“Want to run? Even if I can’t kill you two today, I’ll leave something for you!” Luo Tian’s face was cold. The soul banner swirled, drawing a mass of gray qi into their bodies.

“Roar…” Countless gray qi and several Nine Sources残魂 dragged out the two souls, pulling them before Luo Tian.

The soul banner swirled and absorbed the two souls. Strangely, after absorbing their souls, the broken soul banner became dark and bright, covering the world in darkness.

At the same time, the seemingly broken soul banner slowly repaired itself. The blurred characters on it became clearer, though still indistinct, but they could be recognized as “Tianyuan.”

“That’s the command banner of Tianyuan!” Sha Cangmang, standing on the Supreme Altar, showed shock. He stared at Luo Tian’s black soul banner and spoke in astonishment.

“Roar…” The残魂 roared. A wild sense of connection appeared in Luo Tian’s mind. All the残魂 bowed to Luo Tian’s soul banner.

A sense of blood connection appeared in Luo Tian’s perception. He gently touched the weathered soul banner and showed a sigh, then slammed it into the ground.

“I, Luo Tian of Tianyuan, swear before these ancestors and heroes: one day I will become supreme, leading all the ancestors back to Tianyuan. Rebuild Tianyuan and let it dominate the Four Sacred Star Regions, even leading Tianyuan to conquer beyond the Four Sacred Star Regions and destroy the Demon Region! To avenge the destruction of Tianyuan!” Luo Tian knelt on one knee, speaking to the soul banner that moved without wind. His voice thundered into the sky.

“Roar…” Luo Tian’s words ended, and the残魂 roared again, bowing to him once more.

“Home…” Several Nine Sources Supremes looked at Luo Tian, their voices deep and filled with endless longing.

Sha Cangmang and the Blue Dragon Sect members watched Luo Tian standing there. Their faces showed admiration, their eyes complex. They seemed to see the rise of Tianyuan.

They knew Luo Tian had become a force to be reckoned with. Unless the two major bosses joined forces, no one in the Four Sacred Star Regions could control this young man.

“Master, time is short. Let’s go!” Dou Jiande spoke, breaking their thoughts.

“Yes… let’s go!” Sha Cangmang showed admiration and ordered the others to leave.

“Go?” Luo Tian’s face showed a mocking smile. His eyes were cold as he scanned the Blue Dragon Sect members without speaking.

When the Blue Dragon Sect members felt Luo Tian’s gaze, Sha Cangmang’s face changed. He stopped in place and spoke softly: “Do you want to block us?”

“I dare not, Master. I remember all of you took care of me before!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed a smile, emphasizing the word “take care” and spoke coldly.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the Blue Dragon Sect members’ faces changed. They thought of their past actions toward Luo Tian. He had never offended them, and he even helped the Blue Dragon Sect. If it weren’t for his extraordinary talent, he would have been dead many times.

“Do you want me to turn against you? You know Jin Yousi and Ke Zhen Tian might be waiting outside. If you offend me, you’ll be stuck in the Four Sacred Star Regions!”

“If you let us leave today, I can promise that outside this Divine Realm, you are still my disciple of the Blue Dragon Sect. Your status is second only to mine. I can also help you deal with those two outside!” Sha Cangmang spoke seriously, the first time anyone had dared to threaten him.

But Sha Cangmang was helpless. He could leave the Divine Realm, but those people who followed him couldn’t escape. The several powerful Nine Sources残魂 could not harm them, but they posed a great threat to those behind him. If he ignored their lives and left them here, the loss for the Blue Dragon Sect would be too great. He would become a leader with no subordinates, and Sha Cangmang couldn’t bear it.

“I won’t believe your words anymore. Compared to changing faces, I’m not as good as all of you!” Luo Tian showed mockery, gazing at Sha Cangmang and Dou Jiande.

“Don’t talk nonsense. Time is up. I have only one condition: you must swear blood oaths to prove that the Four Sects betrayed Tianyuan, delaying support and causing it to almost be destroyed!” Luo Tian spoke seriously, gazing at Sha Cangmang.

“No! You can change the condition. I can’t agree to this one!” Sha Cangmang shook his head. If he followed Luo Tian’s words, the Four Bosses’ status in the Four Sacred Star Regions would turn sharply.

“I want… all of Blue Dragon Sect’s attendants! And Tiger Prison Star!” Luo Tian knew Sha Cangmang would never agree to his request. He spoke again, his eyes dark as he gazed at Sha Cangmang, giving him the feeling that if he didn’t agree, Luo Tian would immediately turn against him.

Hearing Luo Tian’s conditions, Sha Cangmang furrowed his brows. The Blue Dragon Sect’s attendants numbered nearly a million people, and such a large number of people would be a massive expense. Sha Cangmang couldn’t imagine what Luo Tian wanted with these insignificant attendants.

Another thing that surprised Sha Cangmang was Luo Tian’s second condition—Tiger Prison Star.

Chapter 796: A Single Golden Letter Shakes the Heavens()

Tiger Prison Star, a place where all criminals of the Four Sacred Star Regions were imprisoned. Its environment was harsh, similar to the Divine Realm, and it was a special place in the Four Sacred Star Regions guarded jointly by the Four Sects.

Sha Cangmang and the Blue Dragon Sect members, hearing Luo Tian’s explanation, showed confusion. They didn’t know what Luo Tian wanted with Tiger Prison Star.

“The first condition I can agree to. As for the second, I can’t agree. Tiger Prison Star isn’t just under the Blue Dragon Sect; it’s jointly guarded by the Four Sects!” Sha Cangmang shook his head gently.

Seeing that Sha Cangmang wasn’t lying, Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly. The reason he wanted Tiger Prison Star was due to his own plan.

After leaving Tianyuan and entering the Four Sacred Star Regions, Luo Tian had learned a truth: even if one was strong, unless they were extremely powerful, without a faction, facing problems would be futile. Like the war between Tianyuan and Yang Huanyu before, if it were just himself, he would have lost. The importance of a faction was evident.

But within the Four Sacred Star Regions, there were many sects, but they all submitted to the authority of the Four Sects. They followed only the Four Sects.

Luo Tian wanted to establish his own faction, becoming the fifth major power in the Four Sacred Star Regions. That way, he could solidify his position there. Also, returning to Tianyuan and breaking the seal would give him a better chance if any unexpected situations arose.

The Blue Dragon Sect’s attendants were the best choice. First, they had lived in hardship for years. Second, his prestige within the Blue Dragon Sect was irreplaceable in their hearts.

Although the attendants’ strength wasn’t high, with enough resources, many of them could significantly improve their power and become comparable to Blue Dragon Sect disciples.

Another place was Tiger Prison Star. Although it was known as a prison for criminals of the Four Sacred Star Regions, Luo Tian knew that the darkness in the Four Sacred Star Regions was such that over 80% of those imprisoned were because they had offended the Four Sects. Only a small part were truly evil.

Thus, Luo Tian planned to gather these people who deeply resented the Four Sects and train them slightly. They would become a terrifying fighting force.

“Then there’s no deal!” Luo Tian smiled, standing calmly beneath the Supreme Altar. He believed Sha Cangmang would give him a satisfactory answer.

Sha Cangmang’s face was grim, his teeth clenched as he gazed at Luo Tian. Seeing no room for compromise, he nodded: “Okay, I agree!”

Sha Cangmang spoke. His heart was bleeding. He could already imagine the other three sects’ demands. Wanting to gain the entire Tiger Prison Star, the Blue Dragon Sect would pay a huge price.

“Then it’s settled!” Luo Tian smiled and didn’t speak further, waiting for Sha Cangmang to swear blood oaths. After all, Sha Cangmang’s credibility was almost zero in Luo Tian’s eyes.

Sha Cangmang naturally knew what Luo Tian meant. His face was dark as he swore blood oaths, agreeing to Luo Tian’s conditions and promising not to clash with him immediately after leaving. He spoke loudly: “Alright!”

Seeing Sha Cangmang’s extremely委屈 expression, the Blue Dragon Sect members’ faces were also grim. When had the Blue Dragon Sect ever suffered such humiliation? Their sect leader and elders being cornered to negotiate conditions.

Luo Tian nodded, waved his hand, and the残魂 around them seemed to sense Luo Tian’s will. They roared and flew toward the distance.

Sha Cangmang and others descended from the Supreme Altar, gazing at Luo Tian deeply before flying away.

But as they just jumped off the altar and took another step, the altar emitted a series of humming sounds. Golden light spread everywhere.

“Hmm?” Sha Cangmang turned around, gazing at the abnormal Supreme Altar without rushing to leave.

Luo Tian also directed his gaze toward the altar. But as he looked at it, his face changed drastically.

In everyone’s view, the massive Supreme Altar shimmered with light. Golden inscriptions flowed like golden dragons, emitting a continuous humming sound.

In the next moment, the altar’s surface slowly rose with golden inscriptions. It looked like a piece of paper, gently rising and changing. Golden light blinded people’s eyes.

“Roar…” The残魂 Luo Tian had calmed down roared again, rushing toward the Supreme Altar.

The golden light faded. A piece of golden paper appeared in people’s vision, making them shocked and filled with pressure. Even Luo Tian and Sha Cangmang felt a sense of awe.

“The Book of Epochs!” Luo Tian gazed at the familiar golden paper, his face showing a serious expression. He had already suspected that this golden paper was related to the Book of Epochs.

Now, seeing the altar’s transformation, Luo Tian finally understood. This golden paper was a page from the Book of Epochs. The Book of Epochs on Tianyuan wasn’t complete.

Wind rose, continuously beating against people’s bodies. A group of残魂 surrounded the golden paper, roaring lowly.

“Take that piece of paper. It must contain secrets about the Supreme!” People’s minds were filled with greed, shouting at the golden paper floating in the air.

But it seemed to sense the roar of a Seven Sources Supreme, and the surrounding残魂 roared toward that Seven Sources Supreme.

A scream echoed in people’s ears. The Seven Sources Supreme hadn’t even had time to resist, and his soul was devoured by the残魂.

“I understand!” Sha Cangmang muttered, gazing at the golden paper in the sky. His eyes showed enlightenment.

“This Divine Realm’s heavenly laws are suppressed by this golden paper. Thus, only here can one reach the Supreme level! Or, if you take this golden paper and bring it to the Blue Dragon Realm, let it suppress the heavenly laws of the Blue Dragon Realm. From now on, everyone in the Blue Dragon Realm might be able to reach the Supreme level!” Sha Cangmang’s face showed excitement, gazing at the golden paper in the sky.

“But what is this thing? Who placed it here? It can suppress heavenly laws! Truly terrifying!” Dou Jiande and others showed fear, thinking deeper. Their minds trembled.

From all signs, this Divine Realm was clearly intentionally cultivated by someone. That person’s cultivation had already reached the heavens. People believed that this great being was beyond Nine Sources, possibly even surpassing the Supreme level!

“Go…” Sha Cangmang, although wanting to obtain the golden paper, knew his current strength. He bit his teeth and saw the hostile残魂.

Not to mention all those残魂, Sha Cangmang felt even without them, obtaining the floating golden paper wasn’t simple.

“Hum…” A fluctuation sounded. The golden paper slowly grew larger, eventually covering the entire Supreme Altar. The altar shimmered with light again, and countless golden inscriptions flew out like meteors, eventually filling the entire Divine Realm’s sky with a strange rule force. Sha Cangmang and others marveled.

At the same time, Sha Cangmang and others moved their bodies, disappearing from the altar’s edge toward the exit.

Luo Tian’s eyes showed contemplation. He gazed at the vast altar, and for some reason, his mind conjured up the figure from the Book of Epochs who had taught him the King’s Seal, Soul-Stealing Seal, and other four seals. He had once tried to see that figure clearly but even after reaching the Soul-Formation stage, he still couldn’t discern its face.
