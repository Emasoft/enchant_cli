“Changtian Xuan Yin!” Du Changtian bellowed, his voice a growl of defiance. To surrender outright would be unbearable; now he had no choice but to unleash his full strength.

“Hum…” Du Changtian’s hands moved in a blur, and golden divine laws erupted from his palms, coalescing into a radiant golden seal.

“High-Level Daoist Martial Arts Technique!” Luo Tian murmured, his lips curling in amusement. After all, he had mastered many such techniques.

“Boom…!” A thunderous roar echoed as the golden seal plummeted from the heavens, descending upon Luo Tian with crushing force.

“Show me your strongest technique!” Luo Tian chuckled, his feet pressing into the earth. A torrent of golden light radiated from him as he charged toward the descending seal.

A storm of golden fists materialized above Luo Tian’s head, colliding with the golden seal. The seal shattered under his fists, scattering into whirlwinds that swept outward.

“Damn it!” Du Changtian’s face darkened as his technique was obliterated. He had known Luo Tian was formidable, but he hadn’t anticipated such utter vulnerability.

“Luo Tian, You Ran is in danger!” Just as Luo Tian shattered the seal, Zuo Qiuming’s voice echoed within his mind.

“Hm?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, scanning the battlefield. Others had already engaged in combat, clashing with resounding booms. Even he needed a moment to locate You Ran.

“I was caught cheating by Duan Chengfeng, who stopped me. He let You Ran accidentally face Yuan Tianjiao!” Zuo Qiuming’s voice explained the situation within Luo Tian’s mind.

“I can’t intervene; if I do, You Ran would be disqualified. But you can—given Master Changfeng’s regard for you, he’ll tolerate your actions and even test how far your strength extends!” Zuo Qiuming’s voice trembled with urgency.

As Zuo Qiuming relayed this, Luo Tian spotted You Ran’s battlefield. His eyes darkened.

In his view, You Ran was battered and bloodied, riddled with sword wounds. A Heavenly Dao Realm cultivator against Yuan Tianjiao, a Celestial Immortal Realm master and prodigy.

“Die!” As Luo Tian’s gaze darkened, Du Changtian’s face lit with triumph. Unaware of Luo Tian’s distraction, he hurled a golden sword toward him.

Lightning fast, the golden blade pierced Luo Tian’s chest. Du Changtian exulted.

“Hm?” Li Changfeng and Zhao Tiancheng furrowed their brows. Why had Luo Tian suddenly frozen? They didn’t want him to die so easily.

“Hah! What a prodigy—still a fool, dying at my hands!” Du Changtian laughed maniacally, certain of Luo Tian’s demise.

“Kill me? Your sword isn’t sharp enough!” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed in Du Changtian’s ears. The golden blade had pierced his chest but halted mere inches, gripped by a golden hand.

“Impossible!” Du Changtian gasped, disbelief etched on his face. Even Li Changfeng and the others watching were stunned.

“This boy’s flesh was prepared by our Earth Gate!” Song Lao’s face lit with excitement, his eyes gleaming as if beholding a treasure.

“Hum…” Luo Tian seized the golden blade, its tip stained with blood. He vanished from Du Changtian’s sight.

“Ah…” Du Changtian trembled, finally grasping the chasm between himself and Luo Tian. A suffocating sense of death gripped him.

“Hum…” A ghostly sound echoed, and Du Changtian felt a chill. The golden blade pierced his back, exiting through his heart.

“Thud…” Du Changtian’s body collapsed to the ground, eyes wide with madness and awe.

“Blame yourself for harboring murderous intent!” Luo Tian muttered, then strode toward You Ran and Yuan Tianjiao’s clash.

“Elder Brother!” Wan Youlan, having defeated her opponent, saw Du Changtian’s death.

On the other side, Yuan Tianjiao smiled faintly, gazing at You Ran, bloodied and helpless. She had no strength left, her eyes weak.

“You killed my brother; I’ll kill your sister!” Yuan Tianjiao spoke softly, her sword dripping blood as she advanced.

“Elder Brother, I’ve disgraced you!” You Ran’s face was pale, blood spilling from her lips. She knew Yuan Tianjiao sought to torment her; otherwise, she would already be dead.

“Yuran! I’m coming!” As You Ran nearly fainted, a familiar voice echoed in her ears.

“Hum…” Luo Tian materialized before You Ran, his killing intent unhidden. He lifted her, pressing a pill into her mouth.

“Rest well; I’ll avenge you!” Luo Tian spoke, then stood. Yuan Tianjiao’s sword was already aimed at him, a pale blue aura swirling like water but laced with frost.

“Hum…” Luo Tian’s golden blade blazed with divine light, and he surged forward.

“Crack!” The two blades clashed. Yuan Tianjiao and Luo Tian were thrown back, but they lunged again without pause.

“Finally a worthy opponent!” Luo Tian’s face darkened, gripping the sword he’d taken from Du Changtian as he charged Yuan Tianjiao.

“Disciples, today I avenge you. Wait for his soul on the轮回 path!” Yuan Tianjiao spoke softly, her blue sword dancing as she rushed Luo Tian.

“Master!” Ke Zhenghao’s gaze flickered toward Li Changfeng. Luo Tian’s actions were indeed against protocol.

“Don’t worry; if neither objects, let them proceed. Ultimately, one must prevail!” Li Changfeng smiled, his interest in Luo Tian growing.

“Crack!” The blades clashed again. Two figures were thrown back but surged forward without hesitation.

Chapter 1806: Battle Against Yuan Tianjiao

On the Sky Dragon Battlefield, figures clashed relentlessly. As time passed, the chaos waned. Winners rejoiced, securing their places as disciples of the Sky Dragon Sect; losers returned to their sects and cities.

Zhang Tianxing, Qian Luofeng, and Wan Youlan wore smiles. They knew their presence had drawn attention from those seated nearby.

“Luo Tian is still fighting!” Time passed, and all paused to watch the relentless clash between Luo Tian and Yuan Tianjiao.

“I thought Luo Tian’s opponent was a weakling. Why is he fighting Yuan Tianjiao now?” Zhang Xing and others wondered, watching Luo Tian.

“Crack!” A thunderous sound echoed as Luo Tian retreated, panting. Yuan Tianjiao was the strongest Celestial Immortal Realm beginner he’d faced.

Yet Yuan Tianjiao was equally battered, their collisions leaving him reeling.

“Autumn Water Sword Technique!” Yuan Tianjiao’s gaze sharpened, his blue sword humming with waves. He surged toward Luo Tian.

“Rippling…!” The next moment, Yuan Tianjiao seemed a tidal wave swallowing Luo Tian.

“High-Level Immortal Martial Arts!” Onlookers gaped. A sect like Zhenxian had such advanced techniques?

“After all, it was a major sect. Having one or two high-level immortal techniques is normal,” Li Changfeng murmured.

“High-Level Immortal Martial Arts? Indeed formidable!” Luo Tian’s face darkened, feeling dwarfed by the tidal wave.

“Boundless Sword!” Luo Tian brandished his golden blade, leaping into the air. Golden sword beams formed a storm, charging toward the waves.

The clash echoed endlessly, two colors of sword energy entwining. Yet against the tidal wave, the storm’s power was eroded.

“Rip!” A sword energy sliced Luo Tian’s shoulder, drawing blood.

“What does he use to block my attack?” All wondered how Luo Tian would withstand Yuan Tianjiao’s assault.

“Crack!” The golden blade in Luo Tian’s hand cracked under relentless collisions.

“Autumn Water Sword is an inferior immortal artifact. Though Luo Tian’s blade is good, it struggles against the Autumn Water Sword,” Zhao Tiancheng murmured. Though Luo Tian’s strength surpassed Yuan Tianjiao, Longyin City’s resources paled against Zhenxian Sect.

Sword energy rained onto the battlefield, leaving marks on the ground that quickly vanished. When the clash ended, Luo Tian stood amidst the chaos—disheveled, bloodied. It was the first time people saw him wounded.

“Truly Yuan Tianjiao!” All marveled, gazing at Yuan Tianjiao’s flowing robes.

“What good is a strong body or soul? Your combat power is trash. You’re just a waste of heaven’s favor, a talentless fool!” Yuan Tianjiao boasted, his blue robes fluttering without wind. His voice rang with confidence and arrogance.

“Crack!” Luo Tian’s golden blade shattered into fragments at his feet.

“Done? Continue then!” Luo Tian spoke softly, tossing the hilt to the ground. He gazed at Yuan Tianjiao.

“Hum…” Luo Tian’s hand grasped the Splitting Heaven Spear, his body bending as he activated the King’s Battle Technique. Golden runes flared, and he vanished from sight, charging toward Yuan Tianjiao.

“Just a brute!” Yuan Tianjiao sneered, raising his sword to form a curtain of energy.

Light flashed. Luo Tian appeared before Yuan Tianjiao, thrusting the spear.

“Hum…” The curtain of energy twisted instantly, ensnaring the Splitting Heaven Spear. Sword energies were ground down, but Luo Tian felt his attack’s power wane, as if striking cotton.

“Yuan Tianjiao’s Autumn Water Sword Technique embodies water—gentle yet all-encompassing, fierce yet earth-shaking. Luo Tian’s style is purely yang, hence his weakness!” Song Lao remarked, yet he found himself admiring Luo Tian’s resilience.

“Give up. You’re doomed to be crushed!” Yuan Tianjiao’s face was cold, his sword swirling with icy breath. A blue water sword surged toward Luo Tian, ensnared by the curtain.

“Move!” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed. He kicked off the ground, twisting his body—but at that moment, he hesitated.

The curtain of energy wrapped the spear, pulling it back. Luo Tian couldn’t retrieve it immediately.

“Can’t dodge!” Luo Tian muttered, golden runes flaring as he punched the curtain.

“No use! You’re just a brute!” Yuan Tianjiao sneered, his sword already before Luo Tian.

“Hah! Have you never heard of ‘might conquers all’?” Luo Tian smirked, striking the curtain.

“Boom!” Like a stone dropped into calm water, ripples spread. A wave of sword energy swept toward Luo Tian and Yuan Tianjiao.

At the same time, Luo Tian shattered the curtain. His golden fist collided with Yuan Tianjiao’s Autumn Water Sword.

Blood spattered as Yuan Tianjiao’s sword bent, then flew away.

“Brilliant! ‘Might conquers all’!” Song Lao clapped, admiration in his eyes. This was the very ideal of Iron Gate Sect—might overcomes all.

“Step back!” Yuan Tianjiao’s eyes widened in disbelief, pushed back by a massive force.

Golden blood dripped from Luo Tian’s fist. His bones were exposed, but he had shattered Yuan Tianjiao’s defense—though at a cost.

“Body withstands inferior immortal artifact!” All gasped, watching Luo Tian’s lowered arm. Who knew he was this strong?

“Reincarnation!” Luo Tian ignored his wounded arm, his other fist swung. The King’s Battle Technique flared again, appearing before Yuan Tianjiao, who had just been thrown back. He struck.

The Reincarnation Channel reappeared, pushing everything aside toward Yuan Tianjiao.

“This is the Reincarnation Channel. How did he achieve it?” All gaped, staring at the gray channel.

“Special体质!” Li Changfeng and others’ eyes gleamed. This was a rare body type.

“Some special bodies can unleash attacks suited to their nature, creating terrifying phenomena!”

“What kind of body is this?” Li Changfeng’s excitement was palpable. Such a body was rare, and they had found one.

“I’ll be his attendant!” Zhang Xing declared loudly. He envisioned Luo Tian toppling the three realms.

“You’re late. I’ve already decided to follow him!” Zhang Xing’s words were met with a counter from Qian Luofeng.

“Damn it, I was first!” Zhang Xing bristled at Qian Luofeng’s claim.

“Hah! Bite me!” Qian Luofeng smirked, his superiority evident.

“Fight! Winner becomes the top attendant!” Zhang Xing sneered at Qian Luofeng.

“Hah! Fight then. I’ve long wanted to!” Qian Luofeng sneered back.

“Two oddballs!” People sighed, watching the absurdity of Zhang Xing and Qian Luofeng’s rivalry.

“Damn it!” Wan Youlan stood among the crowd, her gaze on Luo Tian. Her eyes burned with hatred as she clutched Du Changfeng’s corpse, biting her lip. She knew revenge was impossible now. Even with her furnace body, three major sects would choose Luo Tian.

“I still have resources—my body!” Wan Youlan muttered, unnoticed as Luo Tian was the focus.

Numerous fists materialized before Yuan Tianjiao. The massive Reincarnation Channel collided with him, each impact causing him to spit blood.

“Boom!” The channel vanished, and Yuan Tianjiao collapsed, pale as a sheet. His eyes were weak, like a dog lying there, gasping and spitting blood.

Chapter 1807: Zhenxian’s Eight Styles

“Am I a trash? What does it mean to be like a dog?” Luo Tian’s cold gaze fell on Yuan Tianjiao.

“Cough…!” Yuan Tianjiao spat blood, trembling as he stood. His eyes held defiance.

“Hah! Yuan Tianjiao, give up! How can you match your great master?” Zhang Xing bellowed, clashing with Qian Luofeng.

“Exactly! My master is the radiant star in the sky, while you’re just a pebble!” Qian Luofeng retorted, and they clashed again.

“Puke…!” Yuan Tianjiao spat more blood. Whether from Zhang Xing and Qian Luofeng’s provocation or his injuries, it was unclear.

“I am Yuan Tianjiao. I am destined to be a prodigy!” Yuan Tianjiao roared, his blue immortal energy swirling. His Autumn Water Sword trembled, sensing his anger and returning to his hand.

“Now I’ll finish you!” Yuan Tianjiao’s face was frenzied. He spat blood onto his sword, and it glowed blue.

The sword’s tip traced a pattern in the air. A terrifying aura formed above Yuan Tianjiao.

“What is he doing? Still resisting?” All were puzzled. How could Yuan Tianjiao, so wounded, still fight?

“Familiar feeling…” Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He felt he had seen this before.

“It’s Zhenxian’s Eight Styles!” Li Changfeng’s face shifted. He saw the character ‘Bing’ (Soldier) above Yuan Tianjiao.

“Zhenxian’s Eight Styles. The sect’s secret art. A master of Zhenxian once carved eight characters, killing eight early-stage immortal masters and securing the sect’s status!” Zhao Tiancheng gasped.

“Ah! I remember now. When I was at Tianyuan Sect, Li Xiulong used Zhenxian’s brush to perform it. The characters were different,” Luo Tian recalled.

“Bing…” As Luo Tian was stunned, the character ‘Bing’ completed above Yuan Tianjiao. His face grew paler.

“Hum…” The character ‘Bing’ soared, pressing down on Luo Tian. A massive pressure made his face shift. Though just a character, it felt like millions of soldiers charging at him.

“I’ll try too!” Luo Tian spoke softly. He waved his hand, and the inferior immortal brush Zhenxian’s appeared in his grasp. He channeled spirit energy into it.

“Zhenxian Brush? How do you have our sect’s Zhenxian Brush!” Yuan Tianjiao’s face paled. He stared at the golden brush in Luo Tian’s hand.

“Of course, it was given by your brother!” Luo Tian smiled. He had sensed the brush’s uniqueness before; now, seeing Yuan Tianjiao, he felt it was no ordinary tool.

“Beast!” Yuan Tianjiao cursed. The Zhenxian Brush was a sacred artifact of Zhenxian Sect, yet it had been stolen by Li Haoran.

Indeed, Li Haoran had taken it from Zhenxian Sect. Li Xiulong had faked obtaining it in the Endless Forest.

“Hum…” As Yuan Tianjiao cursed, a wave of energy formed above Luo Tian. The golden ‘Bing’ character soared.

“Indeed…” Luo Tian’s face lit with a smile. When he activated the Zhenxian Brush, he felt a special trajectory in his mind, reducing his errors to near zero.

“Crack!” The two ‘Bing’ characters collided in the sky, like two armies clashing. People even heard faint sounds of war.

“Evenly matched!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed. His first attempt was this effective. Though the brush corrected his errors, his initial use was still awkward.

“Damn it!” Yuan Tianjiao’s frustration deepened. His confidence had vanished, his face grim.

“Hum…” Yet Yuan Tianjiao refused to give up. He spat more blood, and the energy surged again from his sword.

“Hum…” The energy rose. Yuan Tianjiao’s face was pale, eyes filled with resentment as he wielded his sword again. This time, people felt his immortal energy plummeting rapidly.

“Second style?” Luo Tian’s eyes lit with interest. He had long wondered how to learn the second style of Zhenxian’s Eight Styles. Yuan Tianjiao had gifted it to him.

Purple lightning flickered in Luo Tian’s eyes. Yuan Tianjiao appeared transparent, his immortal energy flow clear to Luo Tian.

Observing this, Luo Tian wielded the Zhenxian Brush, ready to counter Yuan Tianjiao.

“Already mastered!” All gaped. Their movements mirrored Yuan Tianjiao’s almost perfectly.

Two immense energies coalesced above Luo Tian and Yuan Tianjiao. A blue ‘Lin’ (Command) appeared over Yuan Tianjiao, pressing toward Luo Tian.

At the moment the ‘Lin’ character formed, Luo Tian’s golden character surged. His face shifted instantly; within moments, half his immortal energy was drained.

“Truly terrifying consumption!” Luo Tian muttered. He waved the golden character, colliding it with the blue ‘Lin’.

The thunderous clash echoed. Thunder roared as two characters vanished, forming a storm that swept outward. The Sky Dragon Battlefield trembled; Luo Tian and Yuan Tianjiao were engulfed in the storm.

“Stop!” As the storm swept, Li Changfeng moved. Others might not see it, but he could sense what was happening.

Luo Tian held the Splitting Heaven Spear, approaching Yuan Tianjiao, who had been drained of strength. He aimed the spear at Yuan Tianjiao’s throat.

“Luo Tian, show mercy! Yuan Tianjiao is also a prodigy. His cultivation was hard-won. Perhaps you’ll still be in the same sect!” Li Changfeng spoke softly, pleading for Yuan Tianjiao.

“Master, you’re mistaken. If he hadn’t intended to kill my sister, I might have let it go for your sake. But now? He must die—whether alive or dead!” Luo Tian’s voice was cold, gazing at You Ran who had recovered slightly.

“Luo Tian, you’re just a prodigy. Do you know who you’re talking to?” Ke Zhenghao rebuked Luo Tian for ignoring his master’s face.

“Sky Dragon Sect Master, Immortal Strength!” Luo Tian spoke softly. He gazed at Ke Zhenghao with a smile.

“Know it, yet defy?” Ke Zhenghao’s voice rang out. His aura pressed down on Luo Tian.

“You’d let your sister be killed and ask me to forgive him? Would you?” Luo Tian scoffed, countering. Though Ke Zhenghao was strong, this was Luo Tian’s principle. No one could sway his resolve to kill Yuan Tianjiao; he was no ordinary foe, and releasing him would be a future threat.

“You…” Ke Zhenghao’s face darkened. He had no words, his frustration evident.

“Zhenghao, stop!” Li Changfeng’s face was grim. Yet thinking of Luo Tian’s talent, he sighed.

Luo Tian’s talent was indeed remarkable, but Li Changfeng wasn’t sure if he would join the Earth Gate Sect. After all, Iron Gate and Earth Gate were vying.

But Yuan Tianjiao was different. If he saved him, Yuan Tianjiao would choose the Sky Dragon Sect. Otherwise, he’d be branded ungrateful and offend a major sect.

“Hah! Luo Tian, I didn’t misjudge you. How about joining the Earth Gate? There, you can do whatever you want!” Zhao Tiancheng laughed, approaching Luo Tian.

“Master Zhao!” Luo Tian smiled. He had a good impression of Zhao Tiancheng.

“How about it? Don’t think too long. Join the Earth Gate, and your soul will be perfected!” Zhao Tiancheng patted Luo Tian’s shoulder.

“Rubbish! Iron Gate is also suitable for you. Your flesh will progress further!” Song Lao scowled, approaching Luo Tian, eager to act before others.

“Luo Tian, if you join the Sky Dragon Sect, all conditions are acceptable!” Li Changfeng implied, glancing at Yuan Tianjiao. If he joined the Sky Dragon Sect, Yuan Tianjiao could be killed.

“Ah, when will I also be desired by three sects?” People murmured, gazing at others.

“Three masters, I’ll think it over, okay?” Luo Tian feigned contemplation, glancing at Gu Qianxue in the distance.

“Okay!” Li Changfeng smiled, then addressed the over a hundred who passed the test.

Chapter 1808: Supreme Elder

“Those who passed the trial may now freely choose their sect—whether Sky Dragon Sect, Earth Gate, or Iron Gate!” Li Changfeng announced loudly.

“ I choose the Sky Dragon Sect!” The words echoed, and people began choosing their sects.

Among the over a hundred, nearly fifty chose the Sky Dragon Sect. The rest split between Earth Gate and Iron Gate.

Only Luo Tian, Zhang Xing, and Qian Luofeng remained undecided, their gazes thoughtful.

“I choose the Earth Gate!” A youth with a crimson mask spoke softly, standing behind Zhao Tiancheng.

“Not simple,” Luo Tian furrowed his brows. His instinct told him this masked youth was stronger than Yuan Tianjiao.

“I choose the Sky Dragon Sect!” Gu Qianxue, clad in black, chose without hesitation.

“This…” Song Lao’s face darkened as Gu Qianxue and the masked youth chose Sky Dragon and Earth Gate.

As Gu Qianxue’s choice was made, only Luo Tian, Zhang Xing, and Qian Luofeng remained.

“Master, whichever you choose, your loyal attendant will follow!” Zhang Xing, bruised and battered, spoke to Luo Tian. Qian Luofeng followed suit, both in disarray after their fight.

All eyes turned to Luo Tian. After seeing Gu Qianxue choose the Sky Dragon Sect, he made his decision.

“I choose the Sky Dragon Sect!”

“But I have a condition!” Luo Tian spoke, prompting Li Changfeng’s smile.

“Accepted!” Li Changfeng didn’t hesitate. He struck, and Yuan Tianjiao’s body turned to blood mist at his feet. To Li Changfeng, a dozen Yuan Tianjiaos were worth nothing compared to Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian, reconsider. The Earth Gate is better for you!” Zhao Tiancheng’s face darkened at Luo Tian’s choice.

“Indeed, reconsider!” Song Lao urged.

“Two masters, my decision is final!” Luo Tian bowed to Zhao Tiancheng, his voice tinged with apology. He gazed at Li Changfeng.

“Master, my condition isn’t to kill Yuan Tianjiao!” Luo Tian spoke softly. He smirked inwardly: “You value me so much; killing Yuan Tianjiao is too easy for you!”

“Hah! Whatever I can do, I will!” Li Changfeng spoke boldly. This time, the Sky Dragon Sect had gained much.

“I wish to have my adopted elder brother, Zuo Qiuming, rejoin the Sky Dragon Sect and regain his right to vie for sect leader!” Luo Tian spoke softly, revealing his relationship with Zuo Qiuming.

“What?” Li Changfeng’s face shifted. He glanced at Zuo Qiuming.

“Master, Luo Tian is indeed my adopted brother!” Zuo Qiuming’s face was touched. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to reveal their bond.

“This….” Li Changfeng pondered. This matter involved several Supreme Elders, and he couldn’t decide alone.

“ I disagree!” A cold voice echoed from the sky. A figure strode forward, appearing before Luo Tian’s group. The elder wore gray robes, his white hair flowing. A black mole marked his forehead.

“Boy, do you think your talent allows you to act as you please?” The elder spoke coldly.

“Zhang Jinghuan, why have you come?” Li Changfeng’s face shifted. He gazed at the elder.

Zhang Jinghuan, a cultivator of early-stage immortal realm, was an equal to Li Changfeng. He was one of the seven remaining Supreme Elders of the Sky Dragon Sect.

“Nothing, just saw you hesitating. A prodigy? We need disciples, not ancestors!” Zhang Jinghuan sneered.

“Hah! Old Zhang, don’t be so cold!” The elder’s words had barely finished when a loud laugh echoed from the sky. Another elder in gray robes flew into view.

“Father!”
“岳丈大人!” (In-laws!)
At the elder’s appearance, Zuo Qiuming and Xue Yushan smiled, bowing to the elder.

“Xue Old Man!” Zhang Jinghuan and Li Changfeng’s faces shifted. They gazed at the elder with a smile.

“Good to have you back!” The elder smiled, looking at Zuo Qiuming and Xue Yushan.

“Master Li, why weren’t my daughter and son-in-law allowed to vie for the sect leader?” Xue Yushan’s father, Xue Changshan, spoke softly.

“Didn’t we all agree?” Li Changfeng furrowed his brows, gazing at Xue Changshan.

“Agreed? It was your group’s decision to deceive us, right?” Xue Changshan spoke coldly. “Long师兄 (Master Long), though he hasn’t returned for years, who can confirm he’s dead?”

Zuo Qiuming’s master was Long Dao, a cultivator of unfathomable strength. He and Xue Changshan were sworn brothers, hence Zuo Qiuming and Xue Yushan becoming a couple.

“Hah! Old Xue is right. I also regret my decision now!” Before Xue Changshan’s words ended, a wave of energy surged from the Sky Dragon Sect’s peak. Four elders appeared before everyone.

“Damn! Immortals… so many!” All were terrified, gazing at the eight elders with Li Changfeng.

Immortals were rare in the lower realms. Six appearing at once was unprecedented, leaving people to marvel at the Sky Dragon Sect’s might.

“Why have you all come?” Li Changfeng furrowed his brows, gazing at the six elders. He didn’t know why these old men had suddenly appeared.

“Respect Master!” Duan Chengfeng and the other elders who had overseen Luo Tian’s trial bowed to him.

“These are the Sky Dragon Sect’s Supreme Elders!” All gazed with reverence at the eight elders, including Li Changfeng.
