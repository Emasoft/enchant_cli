“Time to give you a name. There’s already a little black one, so from now on, the little black one will upgrade to big black. You’ll be number two!” Luo Tian’s face broke into a smile. He had recently heard about the incident of missing ghosts in the Luo family’s ghost-rearing area.

“Whimper…” The black dog whimpered, expressing its dissatisfaction. It gently licked Luo Tian’s palm, conveying a fawning intention.

“Next time, steal something else. Don’t take so many sheep. Just one sheep would be enough for you to fleece. You should change your tactics, like the Chen family or the Yan family,” Luo Tian said to the little dog.

“Woof!” The little black dog barked twice, its eyes gleaming with cunning. It understood Luo Tian’s words and its black little eyes darted around.

“Genius!” After scolding it, Luo Tian put away the jade slip and let out a long sigh. Even he had to admire Luo Chen’s talent. If Luo Chen could learn alchemy, he would surely become a master of the elixir arts.

“Chen’er, come quickly! There are guests visiting our Luo family!” Just as Luo Tian was sighing, Luoshui’s voice echoed in his mind. Luo Tian strode towards the Grand Hall of Discourse, and every step he took was met with reverence from the Luo family disciples. Over these two days, Luo Tian’s reputation had grown even stronger, especially after Zhang Menlie killed Wang Xiuxiang. His ruthless nature and fondness for torturing those who defied him had become widely known. Upon arriving at the Grand Hall of Discourse, he heard the sound of laughter from within.

“Ha ha! Ambassador, this is our family’s genius, Luo Chen!” Luoshui smiled proudly and addressed the young man sitting on the left side. The main seat was occupied by a youth, with Luoshui seated beside him. The high-ranking members of the Luo family sat on either side, smiling but with stiff expressions.

“Chen’er, come here. This is the envoy from the Wheel Turning Palace, Zhang Tiantian!” Luoshui smiled and addressed Luo Tian.

“Respectful greetings to the envoy!” Luo Tian bowed slightly towards the youth, his gaze scrutinizing him. The youth wore a blue robe and carried an air of arrogance. His aura was formidable, matching Luo Bai’s strength.

“You are the one who caused such a stir in the Beast King City—Luo Chen, the ruthless killer who even murdered his own brother? I heard you also enjoy torturing those who defy you?” Zhang Tiantian sneered, waving his hand as if dismissing a beggar. A streak of light shot towards Luo Tian.

“Peng…” Luo Tian caught the streak with his hand, his eyes darkening slightly. He had indeed caught it, but if he had reacted a moment later, the streak would have struck his face. That would have been embarrassing.

“Your strength is commendable, but your character isn’t great. Remember to take this item when entering the trial grounds; it will ensure you pass!” Zhang Tiantian, upon seeing Luo Tian catch it, flashed a brief surprise but spoke loudly. Luo Tian looked at the token in his hand; it bore the same pattern as Zhang Tiantian’s robe—a black sun.

“If you can’t pass with this, I can only say you’re a complete failure!” Zhang Tiantian’s voice was cold, his eyes filled with disdain. He knew the reason for this mission: the Wheel Turning Palace wanted to recruit a special talent, but it was merely a family heir. To them, this family heir was like a peasant, entering the Wheel Turning Palace through connections. To prevent other families from being upset, they even held a seemingly fair trial, but it was all staged. This had happened before in the Ten Courts of Yama. However, those who entered through connections were looked down upon and held low status. Only a few managed to carve out their own path through sheer strength.

“Hmph, I accept it!” Luo Tian nodded. Though the other party was high-ranking, he wouldn’t give them a good face.

“Hmph?” Zhang Tiantian’s eyes flickered, surprised that Luoshui treated him politely but this Luo Chen was indifferent.

“Luo Chen, do you know how much effort the Wheel Turning Palace has put in to let you enter?” Zhang Tiantian’s face was cold. He knew what he meant; the Luo family should understand, unless they were fools.

“Demands!” No one in the hall was a fool; they were all high-ranking members of the Luo family and understood Zhang Tiantian’s meaning.

“Ha ha, naturally we can’t let the Wheel Turning Palace waste resources. This…” Luoshui chuckled but was interrupted by Luo Tian.

“Father, how are your injuries? Have they improved?” Luo Tian smiled and addressed Luoshui. Although his father’s wounds had slightly healed, he was still weak. Behind him stood a middle-aged man carrying a long sword, who had been assigned by Du Tianming to protect Luoshui.

“Nothing serious. I’ll be fine after some more recovery!” Luoshui smiled, looking at Luo Tian.

“Tiantian, I’ve received the item. We won’t keep you for dinner; after all, our Luo family’s food isn’t as good as the Wheel Turning Palace’s,” Luo Tian smiled and addressed Zhang Tiantian. The hall fell silent after his words, as no one expected Luo Tian to issue such a dismissal.

“Luo Shui, is this how your family treats guests?” Zhang Tiantian’s face darkened. Before Luo Tian arrived, the hall had been respectful towards him, but this Luo Chen was ungrateful and immediately clashed with him. Now he even interrupted Luoshui from giving him the item.

“Apologies, my son is just too wild. Please don’t take it to heart!”

“Chen’er, go down. Come back later to find me!” Luoshui addressed Luo Tian, realizing that with Luo Chen there, it was impossible to have a good conversation. The hall’s people felt secretly pleased; before Luo Tian arrived, Zhang Tiantian had been arrogant, looking down on the Luo family. The Luo family had long been annoyed but held back due to his status. But now, Luo Tian gave no face to Zhang Tiantian and directly pushed him away.

“Father, I’ll stay here. To avoid you getting hurt again after recovering slightly, your mind might be a bit slow and get tricked!” Luo Tian didn’t move but addressed Luoshui. Zhang Tiantian’s strength wasn’t great; if the Wheel Turning Palace were as powerful as legends said, Zhang Tiantian would be low in status. He was just using his position to intimidate Luoshui and others. Such people, Luo Tian wouldn’t waste a penny on. They would never remember your kindness; even if you gave them more, Zhang Tiantian would share it with others and leave little for himself. He might even criticize the gifts as insufficient.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Zhang Tiantian’s face darkened. Luo Tian was right; he was indeed the lowest in strength within the Wheel Turning Palace. Otherwise, this envoy position wouldn’t have been given to him. And he had to share the benefits with many others. Normally, when an envoy arrived at a family through backdoors, that family would treat him like a god and give many treasures. But Zhang Tiantian hadn’t expected the Luo family to be so peculiar, especially this Luo Chen who was so clueless. After arriving, he hadn’t spoken two sentences before sending him away.

Chapter 2089: Stealing the Entire City

Zhang Tiantian stood there with a pale face, his eyes glaring at Luo Tian as if he wanted to devour him. However, since the Luo family didn’t offer benefits, Zhang Tiantian had no choice but to accept it. After all, the Luo family was a royal clan, and he couldn’t find fault without reason. Moreover, Zhang Tiantian had seen the man with a long sword behind Luoshui, who looked fierce and watched him. Du Tianming’s background also made Zhang Tiantian cautious. Luo Tian had taken this into account, so he wasn’t afraid of Zhang Tiantian. Du Tianming’s power had allowed the Wheel Turning Palace to open a special recruitment for him, indicating that Du Tianming held some status within the Wheel Turning Palace.

“Envoys, is there anything else?” Luo Tian smiled and looked at Zhang Tiantian, who was awkwardly standing. The Luo family members also watched Zhang Tiantian, making his face red.

“Nothing!” Zhang Tiantian gritted his teeth and addressed Luoshui: “I’ll take my leave then!”

After saying that, Zhang Tiantian left the hall reluctantly. However, to the Luo family members, it seemed he had no face to stay. Zhang Tiantian had made his intentions clear; he just needed benefits, but Luo Tian didn’t give them. Who could stay?

“Thick-skinned!” Luo Tian muttered, watching Zhang Tiantian leave and puckered his lips. This comment increased the Luo family’s favor towards him, as Zhang Tiantian had been extremely annoying.

“Don’t you know his status? If you get along with him, it’ll be easier for you to enter the Wheel Turning Palace. Although he’s not much in the Wheel Turning Palace, a small person can still play a big role sometimes,” Luoshui smiled and looked at Luo Tian.

“Yes!” Luo Tian listened to his father’s advice, showing respect.

“Alright, the trial will open in half a month. When it does, you just need to go through the motions. If nothing goes wrong, you’ll almost certainly enter the Wheel Turning Palace. That would be a great boon for our Luo family!” Luoshui said, and the people dispersed. He was still weak and needed to recover. If it weren’t for Zhang Tiantian’s status, he wouldn’t have personally received him. The people in the hall bowed slightly, and Luo Tian did too. However, he took his reward from the Grand Competition—a lotus of the other world.

Luo Tian returned to his courtyard, and Zhang Menlie had also become familiar with the place, managing it neatly like a steward.

“Hum…” Luo Tian waved his hand, and a white flower appeared in his palm. As soon as it appeared, a streak of black lightning instantly appeared before Luo Tian but didn’t fight for it. Instead, its eyes showed desire and looked at Luo Tian.

“Second Black, do you want it?” Luo Tian addressed the little black dog with a smile. Until now, he hadn’t known what Second Black was capable of—only that it ate a lot and returned full each day.

“Such an appetite, yet you haven’t changed. It’s a waste of food!” Luo Tian puckered his lips. He hadn’t stopped feeding Second Black with ghost pills these two days, but it still remained the same without any signs of progression.

“Woof!” Understanding Luo Tian’s dissatisfaction, Second Black barked twice as if angered. A wave of black mist surged from Second Black’s body, and in the next moment, its form became translucent, turning into a cloud of black mist. It gradually condensed, revealing a cold scythe, strong legs, and two wings on its back—this was the appearance of a death god.

“Roar…” The death god let out a roar, but it was filled with pride. It looked at Luo Tian in astonishment.

“Second… Second Black…” Luo Tian’s face showed disbelief. He hadn’t expected Second Black to have such abilities.

“Woof…” The black mist dispersed, and Second Black turned back into a cloud of black mist, then transformed into a little black dog.

“Do you mean to say you can transform?” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed, looking at the black puppy.

“Begin your performance!” Luo Tian addressed Second Black with excitement, as if he had an idea.

“Roar…” Next moment, Second Black started to perform enthusiastically, as if trying to gain Luo Tian’s approval and get the lotus of the other world. It kept changing forms.

“Ghost-eater, corpse ghost, bone ghost…” various ghostly forms appeared in Luo Tian’s vision, causing his shock.

“Ha… Ha…” For half an hour, Second Black kept changing forms, transforming into dozens of ghosts and exhaustedly sticking out its tongue. During this time, Luo Tian tested the abilities of each ghost Second Black transformed into.

“Do you mean to say that if you devour a ghost’s pearl, you can transform into that ghost?” Luo Tian asked Second Black with shining eyes.

“Woof…” Second Black nodded repeatedly, looking at the lotus of the other world in Luo Tian’s hand. If it weren’t for this lotus, Second Black wouldn’t have worked so hard.

“Ha ha, that’s interesting!” Luo Tian laughed and waved his hand, giving the lotus of the other world to Second Black.

The next day, Luo Tian led Second Black out of the Luo family and wandered through the Beast Ghost King City. This was his first time wandering in the Beast Ghost King City. Dressed in a brocade robe, holding a dog leash and leading Second Black, if people didn’t know Luo Tian, they would think he was a spoiled aristocrat. Zhang Menlie seemed like an attendant, following Luo Tian and introducing the places they passed by as if Luo Tian wanted to understand the city’s power structures.

“Did you see? That’s the second son of the Luo family, the ruthless killer who killed his own brother!”

“That’s nothing. I heard she had a maid who slightly offended her, and the lust ghost killed her!”

“Now Luo Chen’s name is enough to stop children from crying!”

“It’s really ruthless. Better not provoke it!” People whispered, watching Luo Tian stop at each gate. Each time he stopped, the family would tremble but still smiled to greet him. However, Luo Tian didn’t enter but only exchanged a few words before leaving, confusing people.

Zhang Tiantian stood among the crowd with a dark face. Since the trial hadn’t started yet, he couldn’t return to the Wheel Turning Palace. Therefore, Zhang Tiantian had no choice but to stay in the Beast Ghost King City. Normally, families who entered through backdoors would treat him with good food and drink, but the Luo family didn’t. They had even driven Zhang Tiantian out, forcing him to stay in an inn and wait for the Wheel Turning Palace’s people to return. With Zhang Tiantian’s status, if it were known, other families would take notice. However, since Zhang Tiantian had come to help Luo Tian cheat, he couldn’t openly act. Others were fine, but if other families found out the Wheel Turning Palace was just playing with them and damaged its reputation, Zhang Tiantian would be dead ten times over.

“Luo Chen, I don’t believe a small family’s disciple can’t control you. Although you can cheat, I won’t let you have it easy!” Zhang Tiantian gritted his teeth and glared with resentment. He was truly the most pitiful envoy of the Wheel Turning Palace.

A day passed, and Luo Tian finally wandered through the entire Beast Ghost King City. Except for the city’s main palace, he had stopped at every other place. That night, a black figure sneaked out of the Luo family with incredible speed, surpassing even the peak of True Immortal. Even Luo Tian couldn’t sense Second Black’s presence. This speed was from the death god.

“Terrifying! If Second Black devours all ghosts, what terrifying thing would it evolve into!” Luo Tian waved his hand, and a black figure appeared. It transformed into three-headed dogs with six big eyes filled with resentment—three-headed dogs.

Three-headed dogs had rarely been released by Luo Tian since arriving in Hell, as their three big heads were too noticeable. Unlike Second Black, Three-headed Dogs were very famous in Hell; there was only one of its kind. It would surely cause a commotion.

“You’re too noticeable, three big heads—too showy!” Luo Tian felt the Three-headed Dogs’ dissatisfaction and showed a helpless expression.

“Woof…” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the Three-headed Dogs barked twice. The three heads gradually merged into one.

Luo Tian was speechless, watching the Three-headed Dogs. He hadn’t expected this creature to go so far just to come out.

“Alright, go play. Take Second Black with you; after all, it’s your bloodline! You have experience with this…” Luo Tian addressed the Three-headed Dogs. The Three-headed Dogs growled and rushed out of the Luo family’s courtyard, its speed no slower than Second Black.

The next morning, two dark figures returned to Luo Tian’s courtyard. On the third day… fourth day… time passed, and people in the Beast Ghost King City felt something was wrong. All families’ ghost-rearing areas were mysteriously missing ghosts. At first, it was just a few, but with daily losses, the number became astonishing. When families realized, their ghosts had already lost half.

“Who? Who dared to steal my family’s ghosts!”

“My Yan family’s ghost-rearing area was also touched—dare to die!”

“My Luo family also lost many ghosts!” The three major families all spoke out, claiming their ghosts had been stolen. However, the Beast Ghost King City’s main palace was the only place without missing ghosts.

Chapter 2090: Reversing the Situation

While the entire Beast Ghost King City was discussing the ghost thief, Luo Tian had closed himself in. He was confident about the speed of Three-headed Dogs and Second Black; even a True Immortal peak couldn’t catch them unless it was an Immortal King, forming a domain to trap them. The only person in the Beast Ghost King City with such power was the Beast Ghost King, so Luo Tian had instructed them not to steal from his mansion. Luo Tian’s closure was to break through to become a ground-level ghost-rearing master, whose status in Hell was extremely high, comparable to a family head. Becoming an imperial-level ghost-rearing master would directly grant him kingship.

Because of his closure, Luo Tian was unaware of the events in the Beast Ghost King City. Meanwhile, Three-headed Dogs and Second Black felt the situation was serious but saw Luo Tian didn’t stop them. They continued stealing ghosts without restraint.

“Damn it, who is it?” As the two dogs devoured like big eaters, the entire Beast Ghost King City was filled with complaints. The two dogs took everything without discrimination, even leaving the Luo family untouched. Each day they returned proudly, appearing like two big black dogs, lazily lying outside Luo Tian’s room. No one could imagine that these two black dogs would stir up such a storm in the Beast Ghost King City.

Time passed, ten days had gone by. All families in the Beast Ghost King City were furious because their ghosts were now less than ten percent, and within three days they would be completely wiped out. Worse still, even with strict defenses, the ghost thief couldn’t be stopped. Even the three major families had to call on their semi-Immortal ancestors, but they still couldn’t catch them. Everyone’s attention turned to the Beast Ghost King. Since only he could do this under a semi-Immortal’s eyes, it was within the million-mile radius of the supreme Beast Ghost King. However, people only suspected but didn’t dare to say it aloud, for he was the Beast Ghost King. Yet people were also puzzled: what status did the Beast Ghost King have to do such a thing?

This incident surpassed people’s interest in the Wheel Turning Palace’s recruitment. Every day, it was discussed and guessed who had stolen the ghosts of all families. In the center of the Beast Ghost King City, a black statue stood in an imposing courtyard. The figure was a middle-aged man with his hands behind his back, gazing into the distance. Though it was just a statue, it gave an imposing sense. This statue was the founder of the Beast Ghost King City. The current fourth-generation Beast Ghost King had reached the Immortal King level, making him supreme in his domain.

“Who dares to smear dirt on my name!” In the grand hall, a middle-aged man coldly spoke. His voice was icy.

“Report to the King: it’s said that the ghost thief is extremely fast. Any ordinary barrier can’t restrain them. All barriers are as if non-existent before the thief!” A subordinate nervously spoke, his first time seeing the Beast Ghost King so angry.

“Enough. I’ll investigate this myself. Tell Lie’er to prepare for entering the Wheel Turning Palace. Although I don’t know who used backdoors, it’s still an opportunity for Lie’er!” The Beast Ghost King smiled and dismissed the subordinate. In another corner of the Beast Ghost King’s palace, a youth stood there with a smile, his eyes like two stars. Standing there, he radiated an aura. Wang Lie, the son of the Beast Ghost King, Wang Qingtian. In the Beast Ghost King City, he was like a god, for his father was Wang Qingtian, the ruler of the Beast Ghost King City. As the son of the Beast Ghost King, he naturally received countless favors.

“If I enter the Wheel Turning Palace through my own strength, it would surely please Father,” Wang Lie whispered to himself, gazing into the distance.

“If I enter the Wheel Turning Palace, would Xuan’er accept my proposal?” His coldness turned into tenderness. A perfect figure appeared in his mind.

Night… The Beast Ghost King silently left the Beast Ghost King City. He wanted to see who dared to steal and frame him. Who was the Beast Ghost King? An Immortal King could hide himself, but no one could find him. In a moment, the Beast Ghost King transformed into a breeze and flew to the Chen family’s ghost-rearing area. As soon as he left the city hall, two black figures appeared outside the city hall—Three-headed Dogs and Second Black. The two dogs had become addicted to stealing, having nearly stolen most of the families in the Beast Ghost King City. Finally, they targeted the Beast Ghost King’s city hall. It was already the second night; on the first night, Big Black and Second Black felt the Beast Ghost King’s aura and were cautious but didn’t enter. It was now the second night, and they had decided to give up. However, they hadn’t expected that the terrifying aura would disappear!

Eye contact, glinting eyes. The two dogs flew up instantly and couldn’t resist the temptation of the ghosts in the city hall, rushing into it.

The city hall was vast. However, Big Black and Second Black’s noses were extremely sensitive, especially for ghosts; finding them was simple. The city hall’s people never expected the ghost thief to dare enter and steal, giving the two dogs a perfect opportunity. They entered without resistance and reached the ghost-rearing area.

The Beast Ghost King’s aura spread, making the ghosts tremble and stay silent. The two black dogs devoured them freely.

One night passed, and the two black dogs proudly exited the city hall, returning to the Luo family. The Beast Ghost King also observed the Chen family for a night, his eyes filled with satisfaction: “Thief! If I catch you, I’ll make you suffer!”

The Beast Ghost King flew out of the Chen family. As soon as he left, his token emitted a wave. A trembling voice echoed in the Beast Ghost King’s mind.

“King, our city hall’s ghost-rearing garden has been emptied…” The trembling voice fell into the Beast Ghost King’s mind, making his face turn iron.

“What!” After hearing the voice, the Beast Ghost King immediately appeared in the city hall and arrived at the ghost-rearing garden.

“Nothing left… not even a single hair!” The Beast Ghost King whispered, looking at the empty ghost-rearing garden.

“Fifteen thousand ghosts, the weakest being True Immortal peak. There were five at True Immortal late stage and one at True Immortal peak—gone! Who!” His voice echoed through the heavens, making the people of the city and other families hear it. Everyone was shocked, their eyes filled with disbelief.

“The Beast Ghost King’s city hall… also stolen! And completely cleaned out!”

“My heavens, who dares to touch the Beast Ghost King’s things? Who is this person with such boldness!” The entire Beast Ghost King City was in upheaval. However, people felt some schadenfreude and a sense of balance because the thief had left them with one percent, while the Beast Ghost King City was completely cleaned out.

“Even the city hall was stolen! This thief is truly heartless!” People in the city discussed, wondering who this ghost thief was.

“Whoever you are, dare to touch my things. I’ll make you give it back!” The Beast Ghost King was truly angry. For years, no one had dared to challenge the Beast Ghost King’s authority. Even the Ten Courts of Yama gave him some respect. How could he not be angry!

An immense aura spread from the Beast Ghost King, changing the world. A wave of heavenly forces surged out, reversing time and space within ten thousand feet, as if time had reversed. Then the ghost-rearing garden’s scene transformed into night, and the scene from last night appeared before everyone. Reversing time was the power of an Immortal King domain. The people in the ghost-rearing garden trembled, feeling the Beast Ghost King was like heaven itself. However, after that, the Beast Ghost King’s face turned grim because he hadn’t caught the ghost thief. The ghost-rearing garden looked no different.

“Ghost!” Everyone’s faces showed shock, looking at the strange ghost-rearing garden with a chill.

The world reversed to normal. Even the Beast Ghost King’s face was grim, and his eyes showed fear.

“Someone who could remain undetected even after reversing time must be at least an Immortal King late stage!” The Beast Ghost King’s face was heavy.

“This matter must not be mentioned. Perhaps it was a great elder who came to our Beast Ghost King City!” The Beast Ghost King addressed everyone, his voice solemn.

“Yes!” Upon hearing the Beast Ghost King’s words, the city hall staff became shocked. They hadn’t expected a superpower to appear in the Beast Ghost King City.

At this time, Luo Tian was still unaware and stood in his spacious room, transforming into a black Tianji Flame Vessel. He continuously absorbed ghost energy, forming a black vortex.

“Ha ha! Finally succeeded! From now on, I am a ground-level ghost-rearing master!” Luo Tian laughed and slapped his hand, dropping a black elixir into his palm.

Chapter 2091: So Good

Luo Tian strode out of the room and saw Big Black and Second Black lying in the courtyard. Their bodies were plump, having grown two sizes, lazily lying there with black eyes barely visible.

“You two…” Luo Tian looked at the two fat dogs, his face showing surprise.

“Woof!” The two fat dogs immediately stood up upon seeing Luo Tian, their black little eyes darting around. Though their bodies were fat, their aura was astonishingly powerful, as if they had transformed. Even Luo Tian felt a sense of awe.

“Woof!” The two fat dogs showed pride, barking repeatedly to recount their glorious deeds to Luo Tian. Luo Tian’s mouth twitched as he listened, his eyes filled with a smile. He patted the two dogs’ heads.

“You two foolish dogs are really impressive! You even stole from the Beast Ghost King’s city hall and weren’t caught!” Luo Tian laughed, feeling speechless.

“Zhang Menlie!” Luo Tian called out. Zhang Menlie immediately arrived at his side.

“Master, you’ve closed your cultivation? How was it?” Zhang Menlie smiled and looked at Luo Tian expectantly.

“This is a seal. Keep it well!” Luo Tian chuckled, pointing his finger and imprinting the seal into Zhang Menlie’s mind. Zhang Menlie’s face showed joy.

“Whether it works or not depends on you. Tell me what happened in the Beast Ghost King City during these days,” Luo Tian addressed Zhang Menlie.

“Good, Master. The one with the most fame is definitely this ghost thief!”

“The master of this ghost thief is truly a genius. He stole from all families in the Beast Ghost King City, even the Beast Ghost King himself! The Beast Ghost King was furious and used his reversal of time to catch him, but he found no trace!”

“Moreover, there are rumors that this ghost thief is a great elder. His strength must be at least an Immortal King late stage, which is why the Beast Ghost King couldn’t find him,” Zhang Menlie addressed Luo Tian with respect. However, he didn’t notice that each time he spoke, the two fat dogs straightened their bodies slightly and showed pride.

“However, this is just a rumor. Now the families in the Beast Ghost King City have formed an alliance to find this ghost thief,” Zhang Menlie added, making Luo Tian sigh deeply.

“Sigh… better to wait for the Wheel Turning Palace’s trial. Let me put off becoming a ground-level ghost-rearing master for now!” Luo Tian muttered to himself. Originally, he wanted to become a ground-level ghost-rearing master and then become a king. But now he felt like being low-key, as becoming a king would require going to the city hall. He didn’t want any contact with the Beast Ghost King, and if he found out it was these two fat dogs who stole their ghosts, he might have him executed.

“Any news on the other two matters?” Luo Tian asked. These past days, he had been closed in, so tracking the mother of the lotus of the other world was assigned to Zhang Menlie.

“Master, there’s a clue, but I don’t know if it’s true!” Zhang Menlie smiled and looked proud. He had spent a lot of time investigating, finally finding some information about the mother of the lotus of the other world in the Luo family’s ancient texts.

“Hearing that the Ten Courts of Yama control the life and death of ghosts. At the end of the Yellow River, there is a Naihe Bridge (Bridge of Forgetfulness), and on it grows a lotus of the other world mother! All the hell’s lotuses flow from there along the Yellow River!”

“Master, the Wheel Turning Palace you’re entering mainly controls the end of the Yellow River. So Master can try to find it,” Zhang Menlie addressed Luo Tian.

“As for the girl, Fu Xingxuan, I couldn’t find any information. However, the Luo family isn’t good at intelligence gathering, so we don’t have enough records about other cities’ talents or new arrivals,” Zhang Menlie added.

“Alright, that’s enough!” Luo Tian said. The clue about the lotus of the other world was already good enough for him.

“It seems I must go to the Wheel Turning Palace!” Luo Tian muttered. At the same time, a guest arrived at the Beast Ghost King City’s city hall.

“Beast Ghost King, our Heavenly Ghost King said that if you hand over Luo family’s Luo Shui and his son to us, our Heavenly Ghost King is willing to give up two cities and owe you a favor!” A middle-aged man spoke, his face showing respect.

“Go back. The Luo family is under my jurisdiction; I naturally won’t use my Beast Ghost King City’s people to exchange for cities!”

“Also, go back and tell the Heavenly Ghost King not to overstep. This is my place, not the Heavenly Ghost King’s city!” The Beast Ghost King spoke solemnly. Two cities were tempting, but the Luo family was more important than two cities.

“Yes…” The middle-aged man sighed. The Heavenly Ghost King had ordered him to kill Luo Shui and Luo Chen at all costs.

The Beast Ghost King refused, so the middle-aged man could only find another way. He might even take matters into his own hands. The middle-aged man was merely an Immortal King late stage, making it almost impossible to kill Luo Shui. He had to turn his attention to Luo Tian.

Meanwhile, a group of people flew into the Beast Ghost King City. Their aura was intimidating, and their eyes showed pride. There were thirty-six people in total; each was an elite of the Wheel Turning Palace and a trial examiner for this recruitment.

“Zhang Tiantian, how did you end up so poor? Are you trying to beg for help?” The leader of the group, an old man, spoke. Behind him were all young men.

“Senior Brothers, I don’t hide the truth. When I came here, I didn’t get any benefits and had to stay in this inn. The family members didn’t treat me with respect!” Zhang Menlie immediately complained, recounting his experiences in the Beast Ghost King City.

“Zhang Tiantian, stop talking nonsense. Who would believe you? You’re just trying to keep the benefits for yourself!” Upon hearing Zhang Tiantian’s words, people became angry. According to past customs, Zhang Tiantian should have given them some of the benefits he received. However, since the Luo family didn’t give him anything, Zhang Tiantian wouldn’t want to spend his own money giving them benefits.

“Zhang Tiantian, you’re just doing this on purpose to keep the benefits for yourself!”

“Right! Give us the benefits, and we won’t bother you!” Others also became angry.

“Senior Brothers, I really didn’t get any benefits. Even this inn was paid for with my own yuanqi stones!” Zhang Tiantian almost cried, feeling his misfortune. He knew he couldn’t escape today. No matter if he got benefits or not, they would take their share. If he didn’t give them something, Zhang Tiantian wouldn’t have a good day today. He thought of this and felt more hatred towards Luo Tian, as if it weren’t for Luo Tian, he wouldn’t be so miserable.

“Senior Brothers, I really didn’t get any benefits. However, I’ll give you what’s due. But I’d like to ask Senior Brothers for a small favor during the trial!” Zhang Tiantian spoke firmly, and continuously distributed his accumulated treasures.

“Understood. Senior Brother, this matter is on us. Although we can’t cancel his qualification, we can make him suffer a little. After all, the trial is in our hands!” A young man smiled and took responsibility for Zhang Tiantian.

“Thank you, Senior Huang!” Zhang Tiantian smiled with strong gratitude. His heart was bleeding; the treasures he had distributed were at least his century’s worth.

“The Wheel Turning Palace selection trial will start early tomorrow!” At the same time, the old man leading the group took out a stone and spoke to it. The stone emitted a deep rumble, and everyone in the Beast Ghost King City heard the old man’s words.

“Finally started!” Almost everyone had an expectant look, gazing at the central direction of the Beast Ghost King City. All the city’s talents were ready to seize this chance for a leap.

“Tiring! I don’t know what the Heavenly Ghost King was thinking, sending me to the Beast Ghost King City. I can kill anyone, but I can only bully this Luo Chen!”

“This trial is also an opportunity. If handled properly, I could kill Luo Chen and escape,” the middle-aged man heard the old man’s words. His eyes flickered slightly.

“Father, I’ll prove myself. Xuan’er, wait for me! I’ll enter the Wheel Turning Palace!” Wang Lie stood in the courtyard and roared, flying towards the designated trial location. Meanwhile, other families and the city’s talents also left their homes and flew towards the trial site.

In the Luo family courtyard, Luoshui had recovered to normal after these days of rest. He was now walking with his hands behind his back, smiling.

“Chen’er, do you have confidence?” Luoshui spoke softly and turned around with a smile, looking at Luo Tian.

“If I can cheat and still lack confidence, then if I fail, I’ll be a complete failure as Zhang Tiantian said!” Luo Tian smiled.

“Unfortunately, if Chen’er truly succeeded, it would be great!” Luoshui’s eyes showed sorrow. His voice was calm but made Luo Tian shocked, his face pale.

Chapter 2093: Trial Begins

A black hall stood on the ground, with four fierce beasts making people gasp in awe.
