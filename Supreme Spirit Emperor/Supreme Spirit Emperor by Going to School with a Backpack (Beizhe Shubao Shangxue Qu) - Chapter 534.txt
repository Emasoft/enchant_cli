Though Luo Tian was somewhat battered, he was far stronger than Chen Tiansheng and Zhang Menlie. During this time, there were several instances where he narrowly escaped being killed by the Soul-Tearing Ghost Beast, but he managed to escape each time with sheer luck.

Throughout this journey, many people witnessed Luo Tian and his companions. Some were unfortunate enough to become food for the Soul-Tearing Ghost Beast, while others fled in panic.

"Damn it! I had nothing to do with this! Why did you drag me into it!" Sun Menlie groaned in frustration. He had already escaped, yet he was forcibly pulled back into the fray.

"Regret!" At this moment, Sun Menlie cursed Luo Tian and even more so Chen Tiansheng. If it weren't for Chen Tiansheng's relentless pursuit, he wouldn't be in this situation.

Sun Menlie was no saint either. He chose to head toward the light column, as hellish cultivators possessed a unique method to detect other ghost cultivators' locations.

In fact, no need for this technique—everyone could guess that the gathering point was clearly the light column.

With a thunderous roar, the three of them ran ahead and behind each other for half a day before finally reaching the battlefield with thousands of people.

"Boom... Boom..." The appearance of Luo Tian and his companions did not draw attention, but the emergence of the Soul-Tearing Ghost Beast immediately captured everyone's gaze.

"That's..." Almost instantly, people gasped in shock. As they gasped, three figures rushed into the crowd one after another.

"Rumbling..." Spines erupted, instantly claiming countless lives and causing everyone to gasp in horror.

"Roar..." The Soul-Tearing Ghost Beast let out a deafening roar, then sucked in a mass of corpses into its maw.

"Damn it! Who brought this thing here!" The people who had chased Luo Tian earlier were instantly terrified.

"It's Luo Tian!"

"Who is that middle-aged man?" Almost simultaneously, everyone's eyes turned to the running Luo Tian. However, hellish cultivators recognized Luo Tian's true identity, while the soldiers of Baitian City saw his transformed appearance.

"Roar..." As people were astonished, the Soul-Tearing Ghost Beast roared again, claiming twenty to thirty more lives.

"Let's all attack and kill it! Whoever kills it will be the one who killed the most!" In an instant, everyone reached a consensus and unleashed their martial techniques toward the ghost beast.

Everyone knew that the ghost beast was a killing machine. If they killed it, those who had been slain by it would automatically be counted as the killer's victims. It was certain that whoever killed it would be the one who had slain the most.

With thousands of people blocking his path, Luo Tian finally caught his breath. He felt the ghost beast had not broken through and, after running for a while, panted heavily. His gaze fell upon the ghost beast surrounded by thousands of people.

"Apologies, big guy. I had no choice. May you travel well!" Luo Tian sighed deeply. He knew the Soul-Tearing Ghost Beast was doomed—thousands of true immortal realm cultivators, even those at the late true immortal stage would perish.

However, those at the late true immortal stage wouldn't stay to fight; if they wanted to escape, no one could stop them. But the Soul-Tearing Ghost Beast couldn't—its speed was too slow.

Like Luo Tian, Chen Tiansheng and Zhang Menlie also chose not to get involved. As soon as the ghost beast was occupied, they split up and fled in different directions.

Chen Tiansheng and Zhang Menlie were now at their weakest, finding a relatively safe spot to recover.

"This is terrifying. I'll remember this grudge against Luo Tian. Once those cultivators kill the ghost beast, I'll shout your name—surely many will want to kill you!" Chen Tiansheng panted heavily, his eyes filled with madness. He had suffered too much recently.

As for Zhang Menlie, although Chen Tiansheng felt some guilt, he didn't care much. Whether in terms of status within the Hellish Army or their families' positions in hell, Chen Tiansheng was far superior to Sun Menlie. It was already a miracle that Zhang Menlie had survived this journey.

"Damn it! They all deserve to die! I want a title of nobility! Kill Chen Tiansheng!" Zhang Menlie's hatred was immense. Among the three, he had suffered the most—along the way, Zhang Menlie had exhausted all his strength and was now barely alive.

"Kill him!" The cries of battle echoed through the sky, as treasures and martial techniques clashed against the ghost beast.

Though the ghost beast was powerful, it fought back fiercely, but with each counterattack, more cultivators perished and were devoured.

Yet the ghost beast's fate remained unchanged; after wave upon wave of attacks, its massive body could no longer withstand the assault.

"Boom..." A thunderous explosion echoed as, under everyone's anticipation, the towering body of the Soul-Tearing Ghost Beast collapsed with a resounding crash, disintegrating into swirling black mist that scattered from people's sight.

"Crash..." As the Soul-Tearing Ghost Beast disintegrated, a series of dark lights shot toward the light column.

"That's... a ghost artifact!" Almost instantly, everyone's faces showed shock as they gazed at the scattered dark lights—hundreds of them in total.

"Ah, the treasure of this level was inside the Soul-Tearing Ghost Beast!" Someone exclaimed in shock.

A powerful aura immediately drew people's attention—a black sword that transformed into a streak of lightning, soaring over their heads toward the light column.

"High-grade ghost artifact!" Everyone's breath quickened as they stared at the black sword. High-grade divine artifacts were rare in the immortal realm, and high-grade ghost artifacts were equally scarce in hell.

"Crash..." However, the dark lights erupted too quickly; almost instantly, they vanished into the light column.

"Roar..." The black mist formed from the shattered ghost beast also rushed toward the light column, gathering into a grotesque head that took on the form of a totem.

"That was prepared for those who passed this trial!" A moment later, people's breaths quickened as they watched the treasures fall into the black palace within the light column.

"Buzz..." As the ghost beast's totem slowly coalesced, a black light flickered and formed a number in people's sight.

"Two thousand nine hundred and eighty-five? What is this?" People were puzzled, watching the black mist form a large character that floated over their heads.

"This must be the number of those who just died!" Soon, people guessed and their eyes gleamed with excitement.

"This number falls on whoever it is—this person will be the one who killed the most!" People immediately understood, their eyes burning with desire.

"It fell on me!" Almost everyone's hearts were filled with this thought, but the number drifted away from their sight and flew toward a small hill three thousand zhang away.

Chapter 2047: Can't Take It Anymore ()

"The seal has finally disappeared!" Luo Tian sighed deeply, sitting cross-legged with a joyful expression.

As the ghost beast was slain by everyone, the seal within Luo Tian's dantian naturally vanished. He could now summon the divine qi from his dantian.

Chen Tiansheng and Zhang Menlie also displayed intense joy, beginning to fervently refine the surrounding thick ghost qi to recover their injuries.

As Luo Tian stood up, his brows furrowed slightly. A streak of light appeared above his head, hovering there with no fluctuation—more like an emblem.

"What is this?" Luo Tian was momentarily stunned, reaching out to grasp the dark light but only caught empty air.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed, his body suddenly reversed and vanished into the small hill.

As soon as Luo Tian disappeared, a series of thunderous roars echoed through the sky. A golden great sword landed on the spot where Luo Tian had stood.

Boom, boom, boom...

The great sword fell and sliced into the small hill, instantly turning it into flat ground. But that was not all—numerous martial techniques rained down upon the location where Luo Tian had been.

The thunderous explosions shook the heavens, and a massive crater instantly appeared in people's sight. Luo Tian's face was grim as he stood outside the crater.

"Luo Tian!" Hellish ghost cultivators shouted, their voices filled with madness as they prepared another attack.

"Is he Luo Tian?" The Baitian City cultivators hesitated slightly, but they still gathered their strength and launched martial techniques toward Luo Tian.

"What's going on!" Luo Tian shouted, then took off again, fleeing toward the distance. He felt his scalp tingle as he sensed several thousand true immortal realm experts behind him.

"It must be the number's issue! Could it be..." Luo Tian guessed while fleeing, but there was no time to think. Even if he was as powerful as a half-true immortal, facing several true immortal early stage experts and one mid-stage expert was too much.

"Whoever kills Luo Tian will be the one who killed the most and receive a title of nobility!" The hellish people were completely frenzied, their eyes bloodshot as the temptation to kill Luo Tian was too great.

The Baitian City people were also excited. Although they saw a middle-aged man, at that moment, they viewed him as the treasure that had just flown out.

Since the hellish ghost cultivators all said this middle-aged man was Luo Tian, there was a 90% chance he was indeed Luo Tian. He had the Ghost Valley Seal!

"Kill!" Several thousand people began a wild pursuit of Luo Tian.

"I'm not involved in this!" Luo Tian didn't roar but fled desperately, and wherever he passed, people who had been consumed by greed instantly obliterated him.

"Haha! Luo Tian, you've come to this!" Chen Tiansheng laughed wildly, watching Luo Tian lead the group away. He was delighted to the core.

"Karma!" Zhang Menlie also exclaimed loudly, his eyes filled with hatred as he gazed toward Chen Tiansheng's direction.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian's speed was strange; in desperation, he even surpassed a true immortal early stage. Occasionally, he used the King's War Technique, allowing him to escape danger repeatedly.

Luo Tian's speed was not something everyone could match; gradually, the number of people behind him dwindled until only a few hundred remained.

"Damn it! Fight me one-on-one!" Luo Tian shouted furiously, but the few hundred behind him were strong—two of them were mid-stage true immortal experts.

However, Luo Tian was met with a barrage of attacks that left him vomiting blood. Since entering this palace, he had been constantly hunted.

"Damn it! I can't take it!" Luo Tian cursed, his speed surged again, becoming even faster and almost forming a straight line as he fled toward the distance.

As Luo Tian's speed increased again, more people were left behind, leaving only two mid-stage true immortal experts and three early-stage true immortal youths to follow.

"Five!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed as he sensed five people behind him. He felt his opportunity had arrived. If before he had a 50% chance, now it was 70%.

"Two mid-stage true immortal experts and three late-stage true immortal experts!" Luo Tian muttered, his eyes showing a ruthless glint. However, he did not turn back to fight; he feared the commotion would draw more attention.

"Let's circle around!" Luo Tian led the five people through the vast space again.

Meanwhile, those who had been left behind dispersed and formed temporary teams to search for Luo Tian.

Time passed slowly, a day slipped by unnoticed. As Luo Tian led the five people through flight, he felt it was about time and a cold expression appeared on his face.

"Now it's my turn!" Luo Tian leapt onto the peak of a black mountain, which was barren and devoid of life.

"Boom!" Luo Tian's feet landed on the mountain's summit, and without a word, he took out his Shiyi Bow. His eyes narrowed as he gazed at the five people flying toward him.

"Two mid-stage true immortal experts!" Luo Tian flexed his arms, placing a Mie Shen Arrow and a Lie Tian Spear on the Shiyi Bow. His arms began to exert force.

Divine qi surged from Luo Tian's dantian, continuously flowing into his arms.

"I must kill them with one shot!" Luo Tian shouted in his heart, unleashing two high-grade divine artifacts. He had never attempted this before.

"Crack..." A series of sounds echoed from Luo Tian's arms, and an abnormal terrifying aura emanated from the Shiyi Bow.

"Open!" Luo Tian roared, using all his strength—including divine qi—this shot nearly drained all of Luo Tian's divine qi. It was clear how terrifying these two arrows were.

"Crack..." Cracks spread from Luo Tian's feet, and the towering mountain began to crack bit by bit. Under the pressure emanating from Luo Tian's body, the massive mountain collapsed with a thunderous roar.

After Luo Tian's effort, the Shiyi Bow finally reached its full draw, emitting an apocalyptic aura that darkened the heavens and caused winds to swirl.

The gusts surged, and Luo Tian stood amidst the dust, his long hair flying as he gazed at the five people who were less than ten thousand zhang away. His eyes flashed with intense light.

"Die!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice not loud but causing the five flying people to instantly feel a chill.

The five people saw Luo Tian had stopped and wore expressions of joy, especially the two mid-stage true immortal experts. They eyed each other with hostility; in their minds, killing Luo Tian would be a contest between them.

However, as the five people prepared to accelerate toward Luo Tian, they heard Luo Tian's cold voice and instinctively stopped.

"What's going on? Why do I feel a life-threatening danger!" Almost instantly, the two mid-stage true immortal experts stopped, their bodies trembling involuntarily as if they had been locked onto by a venomous snake. A feeling of helplessness surged within them.

The three early-stage true immortal experts also felt the chill and looked at Luo Tian with disbelief. They saw the Shiyi Bow, Lie Tian Spear, and Mie Shen Arrow in Luo Tian's hands.

"Impossible!" The five people shouted as they gazed at Luo Tian, who was calmly releasing the bowstring.

"Boom!" The bowstring vibrated, and the entire world seemed to freeze. Above the black sky, two streaks of light appeared—only two lights remained.

As they flew, the heavens cracked, and although it seemed slow, in an instant, they reached the two mid-stage true immortal experts.

"Boom boom!" Blood mist erupted; the two mid-stage true immortal experts had no time to react and were instantly blown apart, becoming two blood mists.

But it wasn't over yet; the powerful force also sent the remaining three early-stage true immortal experts flying backward, their mouths spewing blood and eyes filled with terror.

"It worked!" Luo Tian panted heavily, his face showing joy. This was the first time he had truly killed a mid-stage true immortal with his own strength.

"Unfortunately, this was a secret technique; I can't use it often!" Luo Tian whispered lowly, feeling his dantian's divine qi was exhausted. If he forced himself to draw the Shiyi Bow again, it would drain his life essence.

"Just you three left!" Luo Tian sneered, vanishing from the spot like a ghost.

Fear spread among the three youths; the two mid-stage true immortal experts' deaths were too shocking. They hadn't even reacted before the two had turned into blood mists, and their residual power had sent them flying.

"Run!" The three immediately thought of fleeing; if Luo Tian shot another arrow, even their combined strength wouldn't withstand it.

"Buzz..." As the three just steadied themselves, Luo Tian's body suddenly appeared behind a green-robed youth. He held a golden brush and struck the void.

The green-robed youth's eyes instantly showed madness; this attack was astonishing, but it didn't give him a feeling of helplessness.

He raised his hand and summoned a green axe, swinging it to block Luo Tian's attack.

"Crack!" Thunderous sounds echoed; the sound of a thunderclap rang out. The green-robed youth's body flew like a meteor toward the ground.

"Boom!" A deep crater appeared, and the youth's body lay in the center of it. Black mist poured from his body.

Chapter 2048: Thorns ()

"Battle formations are all here!" Luo Tian struck the green-robed youth and did not continue chasing but continuously swung his brush. Six golden characters flew from Luo Tian's hands, instantly surrounding a ten-li radius and forming a golden barrier.

Seeing the golden barrier, the two youths who had been scared off looked grim; they could feel its uniqueness. To break it, they would need a long time.

The remaining three people included two hellish ghost cultivators and one thousand-man commander from Baitian City, but not the eighth army's commander.

The green-robed youth was this thousand-man commander, and the two black-cloaked figures standing in the sky were hellish ghost cultivators.

"He has also expended a lot; those two arrows could kill mid-stage true immortal experts, I don't believe he didn't pay a price!" The two ghost cultivators exchanged glances and immediately decided to team up.

Although Luo Tian was a half-true immortal, his combat power was extraordinary; the only safe way was to team up. Moreover, those two arrows had shocked them too much. If they didn't have to fight, they would choose to flee.

"Wang Daichuan, your defense is strong; you block his attacks!" A scarred-faced youth shouted at another round-faced youth.

"Fang Tianshuo, don't betray me!" The round-faced youth shouted back and summoned a black staff.

"Roar!" A roar echoed from the round-faced youth's staff, surrounding it with black mist. Complex patterns were inscribed on the staff, and two ghost faces occasionally appeared on either side of it.

"Stable! I didn't expect you to bring your family's treasure, the Ghost King Staff!" Seeing Wang Daichuan's staff, Fang Tianshuo's eyes lit up.

"High-grade ghost artifact!" Luo Tian's brows furrowed slightly, his eyes showing more caution. He could overpower early-stage true immortal experts with his half-true immortal strength, but it was due to having more high-grade divine artifacts.

"Show your true power; this kid is thorny!" Wang Daichuan roared, holding the staff and standing in the world. His eyes gazed at Luo Tian.

"You've brought the Ghost King Staff; I won't hold back either!" Fang Tianshuo laughed and waved his hand, sending two streaks of black mist.

The humming sound echoed as the two ghost creatures flew out, then transformed into two swords that landed in Fang Tianshuo's hands. The swords emitted a humming sound.

"Haha! I didn't expect it to be twin ghost swords!" Seeing the two black swords, Wang Daichuan laughed and then gazed at Luo Tian.

"Kid, you're dead now!" Wang Daichuan roared and swung his staff downward toward Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." Fang Tianshuo followed closely behind Wang Daichuan, and the two swords emitted a humming sound.

"Indeed thorny, but nothing too bad!" Luo Tian's brows slightly furrowed and he turned his brush, stepping into the void toward Wang Daichuan.

A single brush against a staff produced a series of explosive sounds, and in an instant, Luo Tian collided with Wang Daichuan.

Luo Tian and Wang Daichuan both retreated, but Fang Tianshuo's figure rushed out, two swords emitting a blinding cold light and stabbing toward Luo Tian.

As they retreated, Luo Tian swung his brush in front of him, and two streaks of cold light instantly struck the brush.

"Good move!" Luo Tian's eyes filled with battle spirit, and he shouted in a barbaric language. He punched forward.

"Boom!" The golden fist collided with Fang Tianshuo's sword, and the black sword did not block the golden fist. The blade bent and collided with Fang Tianshuo's chest, sending him flying backward.

Fang Tianshuo spat blood and showed shock; his body felt as if it had been hit by a mountain, and he flew backward.

"These two are much stronger than those before, like Chen Tiansheng!" Luo Tian immediately evaluated them. They were likely comparable to Bai Tian, Qin He Feng, and Ye Chen's strength.

Luo Tian had defeated Bai Tian before, but that was when neither of them used treasures or divine qi—only their bodies.

If they truly fought with all their strength, Luo Tian would have to spend a lot of effort to defeat Bai Tian.

Luo Tian steadied himself, his fists dripping with golden divine blood. He gazed at Wang Daichuan and Fang Tianshuo; the three of them had seemed slow, but their speed was actually astonishing. Either one's mistake would mean annihilation.

"He definitely expended a lot!"

"We have a chance!"

"Kill him, I want to be titled! The treasures in the Yizang Wang Palace are yours!" Their eyes gleamed with excitement, and they immediately reached an agreement.

"Kill him!" Wang Daichuan swung his black staff again toward Luo Tian, and Fang Tianshuo's body moved with incredible speed, leaving a trail of breaking air.

"Only you two?" Luo Tian's eyes showed disdain; he hadn't even started and they were already thinking about rewards.

Luo Tian held the golden Shiyi Brush, his aura overwhelming. Facing two opponents, he showed no fear, like a god descending from heaven, constantly meeting their attacks.

Within the golden barrier, three people continuously attacked; the entire barrier seemed like a world collapsing, with powerful fluctuations constantly spreading outward.

In the deep pit, the green-robed youth's face showed intense shock. He gazed at the three fighting and was a Baitian City cultivator who had only followed Luo Tian due to his unique movement. He wanted to take advantage of the chaos.

Moreover, one of the two mid-stage true immortal experts was close to him, but he hadn't expected Luo Tian to be so strong—killing two mid-stage true immortal experts with a single arrow.

At that moment, the youth was severely injured and regretted his greed in chasing Luo Tian. Now seeing their attacks, he felt like he had eaten excrement; he feared that if one of them missed and hit him, his life would be lost.

However, at this moment, the youth's bones felt like they were shattered; in this palace with almost no divine qi, it would take at least several days to recover.

"Splitting Heaven Spear!" Luo Tian continuously attacked, holding a Splitting Heaven Spear and the Shiyi Brush. Two high-grade divine artifacts were constantly driven by Luo Tian, but despite being outnumbered two to one, he did not fall behind. In fact, he subtly suppressed the two who also held high-grade ghost artifacts—Wang Daichuan and Fang Tianshuo.

Every time Luo Tian attacked, Wang Daichuan was better off; the Ghost King Staff swung with fierce momentum and had strong defense.

But Fang Tianshuo was not so lucky; every time he met Luo Tian, he would spit out several mouthfuls of blood.

Fortunately, Fang Tianshuo and Wang Daichuan had some默契 (mutual understanding) and their coordination was improving. The number of times Luo Tian hit Fang Tianshuo was gradually decreasing, which made Fang Tianshuo feel a bit better.

"This pair is truly thorny!" Luo Tian's face showed admiration; if they were alone, he would have no doubt.

Not only did Luo Tian admire them, but Wang Daichuan and Fang Tianshuo also hadn't expected their cooperation to be so effective.

"Haha! Luo Tian, you're definitely dead today!" Fang Tianshuo hid behind Wang Daichuan and merged his two swords to slash a black sword qi toward Luo Tian, his eyes showing confidence.

Wang Daichuan swung his staff to form a black shield and continuously blocked Luo Tian's attacks.

"Think of a way!" Luo Tian thought, although he had the upper hand, it would take time to defeat them. This was not what Luo Tian wanted.

"Two Extreme Immortal Soul Beasts!" Luo Tian quickly thought of the two extreme immortal soul beasts. If he fused them, he might instantly break through to true immortal and then completely crush Wang Daichuan and Fang Tianshuo.

However, this thought was immediately dismissed by Luo Tian because doing so would mean he had no chance to become an extreme immortal. He wouldn't take that step unless it was absolutely necessary.

"Got it!" Then Luo Tian's eyes flickered slightly, thinking of a powerful martial technique he had never dared to use.

While Luo Tian continuously fought against Wang Daichuan and Fang Tianshuo, the other 107 palaces also experienced similar scenes. However, compared to Luo Tian's palace, this one was bloodier.

Bloodstained and covered in blood, his shoulder had a wound exposing bone—this was from a late-stage true immortal expert who had sacrificed himself to strike Luo Tian's shoulder.

A number "5000" hovered above his head, a bright red number as if dyed with blood, appearing extremely sinister. His cold gaze under the blood mask looked at the trembling people around him.

"Who still wants to kill me?" The masked man showed disdain, speaking coldly at the trembling people.

"No one dares!" Whether Baitian City cultivators or hellish ghost cultivators, they all shouted loudly.

The masked man wiped his ice sword and looked at the fully formed monster totem on the light column. A wave of energy affected him, and his body twisted, being transported into the light column.

In another palace, a figure wrapped in black mist had eyes filled with bloodlust, holding a black axe. His head also hovered over the number "5000," and he laughed, vanishing from the trembling people's sight.

In each palace, when a person reached the number "5000," they were transported into the light column.

On the bloodstained earth, a youth with cold eyes stood in silence; the surrounding was deathly quiet. His deep eyes were profound, and unlike others, a number "9999" hovered above his head.

Nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine—this number represented that all cultivators in this space, whether from Baitian City or hellish ghost cultivators, had died. Only this youth remained alive.

No one knew who the youth was or whether he came from hell or Baitian City, as if he had appeared out of nowhere.

Luo Tian clashed with Wang Daichuan again, his body retreated and he reached out to grab a golden sword that appeared in his hand. This sword was one of the ten high-grade divine artifacts exchanged by Ye Liangchen—Youlong Sword!

Chapter 2050: Dao Palace Inheritance ()

Five thousand... It seemed like a critical point. As the number "5000" hovered above Luo Tian's head, the totem of the Soul-Tearing Ghost Beast on the black light column roared and a transmission force immediately affected Luo Tian's body.

"Hmm?" Luo Tian had intended to go out and find the person who framed him, but as he stepped out of the cave, he vanished from his spot and appeared in the light column.

These days, everyone in the space was terrified. At first, small groups were eliminated, but later, almost all Baitian City cultivators gathered together.

However, after gathering, people became more frightened because others still died—pierced through the throat.

Everyone was terrified, including hellish ghost cultivators who experienced the same situation. At this point, only about three thousand people remained in the space.

These people were extremely terrified; later, they discovered that death rates slowed near the light column. Thus, both hellish and Baitian City groups stood outside the light column.

The two groups were very peaceful at this moment, neither provoking each other; they stood trembling.

Hell and Baitian City had been at war for generations, but this was the first time they coexisted peacefully. All of it was because people believed in Luo Tian.

"Boom..." As people were listless, Luo Tian's body suddenly appeared within the light column, causing Baitian City and hellish people to be startled.

"It's Luo Tian!" People saw the man standing there with a bewildered expression, but their eyes showed no anger—instead, they displayed intense joy.

"Five thousand!"

"It's definitely him! A few days ago, it was two thousand nine hundred and something. These past days, it's five thousand—those who killed us were Luo Tian!"

"How terrifying! What method did he use?" People's faces showed shock as they whispered among themselves.

However, after Luo Tian entered the light column, people relaxed and gradually turned their eyes toward him with hatred.

"That... it's not me... you all misunderstood!" Luo Tian looked at the hostile eyes of everyone and immediately understood he had taken a big blame.

It was better for hell, but Baitian City was different; the person who had secretly attacked killed so many people and now it was all on him. If he returned to Baitian City, how would he survive?

But Luo Tian didn't think much; his eyes scanned the Baitian City cultivators and hellish ghost cultivators, sensing that the person was among them.

As Luo Tian's gaze swept over them, both groups instantly calmed down and cautiously watched him.

"It's him!" Luo Tian immediately saw a youth in the crowd. The youth was handsome, wearing white clothes with long hair. When Luo Tian looked at him, the youth also gazed back.

Their eyes met; the youth's eyes showed a flicker of crimson light, then transformed into a ghost mist and lightly licked his crimson tongue. His mouth curled slightly as he looked at Luo Tian.

This youth, Luo Tian had seen before—part of the three youths who had attacked the Soul-Tearing Ghost Beast. The other two companions were not seen, but this youth looked very suspicious and radiated evil vibes.

"Who is he!" Luo Tian's heart trembled; he felt a strong sense of danger from the youth. He took a step toward the light column to try and kill that youth.

"He's coming out!" Seeing Luo Tian walking toward the light column, people instinctively took a step back and showed fear.

"No, we don't need to be afraid of him! If he dares to come out, we'll all attack and kill him!" The two groups shouted. This time, they had an agreement, making Luo Tian's mouth twitch.

But Luo Tian tried to extend his hand toward the light column and found he couldn't leave it, so he gave up on leaving. He only remembered the youth's appearance and turned toward the black palace.

"Quickly mature!" The youth whispered to himself, his voice low; people around him didn't notice the words. They were all captivated by Luo Tian.

"He's gone!" Seeing Luo Tian enter the palace, people sighed deeply, as if they had sent away a plague, their eyes showing excitement.

After passing through the black mist-formed gate, Luo Tian entered the palace. As soon as he stepped in, a cold feeling enveloped his entire body.

The hall was the same as outside—entirely black buildings. The walls were carved with ghost figures.

Black mist swirled, and a ten-zhang-high altar stood in the center of the hall. Around it were treasures emitting divine laws.

What surprised Luo Tian was that the altar seemed to have a strange suction force, absorbing divine essence from surrounding treasures.

Cold winds blew; as Luo Tian appeared in the hall, the ghost mist on the altar surged violently, as if a thousand evil ghosts were howling.

Luo Tian did not rashly approach the altar, although he knew this place might hold inheritance of the Yizang Wang. But after experiencing so many dangerous places and receiving several inheritances, he knew some places looked like inheritance but were actually extremely perilous.

Time passed slowly; after an hour, the treasures surrounding the altar suddenly shattered with a thunderous crash. They turned into scraps and scattered on the ground.

"Ah..." The silent hall suddenly echoed with cold winds, and the ghost mist on the altar surged violently.

Divine laws flowed, instantly forming a black hand. This single hand made Luo Tian shiver; although it was just one hand, he could feel this hand could crush the world. Even figures like Ke Duanshan or Jiang Chen would be crushed by it.

"This..." Luo Tian took a step back, fearing the hand would fall and crush him. He even considered using the纪元之书 (Epoch Book).
