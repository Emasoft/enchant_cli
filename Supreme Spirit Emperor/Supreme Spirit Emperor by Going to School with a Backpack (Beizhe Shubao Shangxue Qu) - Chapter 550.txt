“Both sides have taken my benefits, so I can’t just accept them for free. How about this—fifteen minutes. After fifteen minutes, I’ll leave. What do you say?” Luo Tian’s face was slightly embarrassed as he looked at the two groups whose eyes were burning with fury.

“Good!” Wang Lie and his companions shouted. At last, they felt their money hadn’t been wasted, regaining some balance. The thirty or so disciples of the Turn-Revolution Hall sighed in relief; they had truly feared this bastard’s insatiable greed. If they hadn’t been able to resist, they would have had no choice but to accept the punishment from the Turn-Revolution Hall. They couldn’t risk their entire fortune for a mission.

“Open it up!” With motivation and hope, Wang Lie’s group launched relentless attacks. The Yellow River Water surged violently, being gradually worn down by their assaults.

Meanwhile, the Turn-Revolution Hall disciples continuously unleashed their divine power, pouring it into the Yellow River Water to counter the terrifying assaults.

Boom! Boom! Boom... The thunderous roars shook the heavens, but none of it concerned Luo Tian. He began to absorb the black spiritual crystals to recover.

Time passed slowly. The fifteen minutes were nearly up, and both sides seemed unharmed but exhausted.

At this moment, the larger group held an advantage. The Yellow River Water had been nearly worn down and no longer flowed, appearing like stagnant water. At this point, only a hundred heartbeats remained until the agreed time.

“Final move!” Wang Lie bit his finger, carving symbols onto the black ghost sword. Bloodstained runes appeared on the blade’s aura, causing it to radiate an overwhelming presence.

“Woo—” The black ghost sword split in Wang Lie’s hands into two, each radiating immense power. They slashed toward the yellow river.

Yan Shu’s eyes showed urgency as a withered branch appeared in his hand. Though withered, people could sense the immense vitality within it.

His blood also flew out from Yan Shu’s hand, landing on the withered branch. The branch immediately emitted a series of divine laws, expanding into a giant tree’s silhouette that swung toward the Yellow River Water.

Chen Tianzhou took out a shuttle and spat blood, which transformed into red threads that instantly wove into a blood-colored battle robe covering his body. He now looked like a god, charging toward the Yellow River Water with that blood-colored robe.

Dozens of people unleashed their ultimate techniques, and thunderous, world-destroying auras collided with the Yellow River Water.

“Let’s fight!” The Turn-Revolution Hall disciples felt the terror of these techniques and trembled. They exchanged glances, then spat blood. The Yellow River Water flowed again, suddenly turning crimson and forming a long river of blood that swept across the heavens.

In an instant, several techniques collided with the crimson river. The thunderous roars made Luo Tian’s face change, and a gust of wind nearly blew him out of the transparent barrier.

The thunderous roars spread, and chaotic energy engulfed everyone. Even Luo Tian couldn’t see what was happening.

However, several figures flew toward Luo Tian’s side—those were the thirty or so disciples of the Turn-Revolution Hall.

“Only thirty heartbeats left! The fifteen minutes are up!” Someone shouted. A streak of bloodlight burst through the smoke, eyes filled with madness as it rushed toward Luo Tian’s transparent barrier behind him.

“Only I have the right to enter the Turn-Revolution Hall!” Wang Lie roared, following closely and pushing his speed to its limit.

Yan Shu, pale-faced, also soared into the air toward the transparent barrier.

At this moment, the scene inside the hall was fully revealed to Luo Tian. Almost everyone had been injured in that collision.

“Haha, I’m first!” Chen Tianzhou wore a blood-colored robe, but it was more like a tattered mess. Bloodstained energy surrounded his body.

It was precisely because of this blood-colored robe that Chen Tianzhou suffered the least damage, allowing him to rise first. Now he stared at the transparent barrier with eyes filled with determination, believing that if his speed was sufficient, he would be the first to break through.

“Done! We’ve lost thirty barriers and failed the mission!” Thirty or so disciples of the Turn-Revolution Hall wore bitter expressions. They wanted to stop but had no strength left.

“Were we the most miserable group in this trial?” The thirty or so people lying there looked at Luo Tian simultaneously.

“Unfortunately!” But as Chen Tianzhou was only a few hundred feet away from the barrier, a sigh echoed in his ears. A figure appeared before him like a ghost, and a black shadow blocked his path.

The black brush with its dark bristles and handle struck Chen Tianzhou. It was the Zhenxian Brush, and the figure was Luo Tian.

The black shadow fell swiftly without giving Chen Tianzhou a chance to react, striking him directly and sending his body flying backward.

“Luo Chen, you broke your promise!” Wang Lie and Yan Shu shouted. Though their faces showed joy, two black lightning bolts appeared behind them, biting into their butts.

“Grrr…” Two agonizing cries echoed in the hall. Two large fat dogs bit their butts, stopping them from moving forward.

“Don’t you dare!” Yan Shu and Wang Lie roared, slapping their hands toward the two black fat dogs behind them.

“Plop! Plop!” Two dull sounds echoed. Their hands swelled up, feeling like they had hit iron. The two large fat dogs seemed unaffected and clung tightly to them, preventing movement. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t break free and felt as if they were carrying a mountain.

“Luo Chen!” The thirty or so disciples of the Turn-Revolution Hall, who had been desperate, now changed expressions. Their hearts couldn’t take it—unexpectedly, Luo Tian had stepped forward at the crucial moment.

“Disgraceful!” Others lying on the ground looked at Luo Tian and spat out old blood.

“Ten… nine… eight…” Luo Tian stood still, holding the black Zhenxian Brush. His gaze fell on Chen Tianzhou lying on the ground, who hadn’t gotten up yet.

“I really gave you a chance. It was your own fault.”

“The fifteen minutes are up. Sorry, I’ll go first!” Luo Tian spoke softly as he walked toward the transparent barrier amidst everyone’s furious gazes.

“Luo Chen, this isn’t over!” Wang Lie roared, continuously beating his backside while watching Luo Tian step toward the barrier.

“I said I’d leave after fifteen minutes, not that I wouldn’t block you. Blame me?” Luo Tian smiled as he walked toward the barrier, addressing them.

“Ancestors! Father! You damn well don’t talk nonsense. Just get out already, I can’t take it anymore!” The thirty or so disciples of the Turn-Revolution Hall looked at Luo Tian still having time to talk and cursed inwardly.

“I’ll end this trial!” Luo Tian waved at those who couldn’t get up and stepped out of the barrier.

“Finally over…” The thirty or so disciples of the Turn-Revolution Hall sighed deeply, collapsing onto the ground.

“Finished…” The remaining participants also collapsed on the ground, their eyes filled with despair. Outside the hall, it was still a sea of people. Their faces were full of anticipation as they watched the hall, constantly discussing who would win this trial.

“Probably about to end!”

“I think it’s Wang Lie, the son of the Beast Ghost King!”

“Yan Shu and Chen Tianzhou aren’t weak either!” People whispered, hoping their clan members would succeed.

“Woo…” As people discussed, the hall emitted waves of black energy.

“Ended!” Lin Dong opened his eyes and gazed at the black hall. Others heard Lin Dong’s words and looked toward the hall. Though he knew what the final outcome was, he still wanted to see what changes had occurred in the hall, reducing the four beast god laws by eight-tenths.

Black energy surged. A figure appeared in people’s sight, causing them to gasp.

“It’s him!”

“Luo Chen! How is that possible?” Everyone showed disbelief, gazing at Luo Tian who appeared in their sight. None of them expected Luo Chen to be first, even though he had some fame in the Beast Ghost City. Compared to Wang Lie and others, he was still lacking.

“Roar…” A roar echoed from the four statues above the hall. Black energy spewed out, and figures were expelled, causing people to be shocked.

Chapter 2100: Assassination()

Figures were expelled from the four statues, falling onto the ground. Each expulsion caused people to gasp.

“Is that Liu Family’s young master? How pitiful!”

“Not just the Liu Family’s young master. Everyone looked pitiful inside. What happened in there?” People whispered.

“Plop! Plop…” The sound of falling continued. Soon, dozens were expelled, all collapsing on the ground with weak expressions.

When thirty-six disciples of the Turn-Revolution Hall appeared, they too looked like they were about to die, leaving people stunned.

“What happened?” People stared at the thirty-six disciples of the Turn-Revolution Hall, even Zhang Tiantian was unconscious. They gasped.

“Didn’t they supervise the trial participants? Why are they like this?” People were confused.

The Turn-Revolution Hall had recruited disciples multiple times in the Beast Ghost King City, but this was the first time such a situation occurred.

Lin Dong’s face changed as he looked at the thirty-six disciples. A bad premonition arose in his heart.

“Woof… Woof…” Three figures appeared. Chen Tianzhou was awake, with a black mark on his chest.

Wang Lie and Yan Shu appeared. Their faces turned red as they beat their backsides repeatedly.

“Damn it, let go!” They roared but couldn’t get the two black dogs to release.

“Boom…” The crowd became chaotic. With Wang Lie and others appearing, the four statues stopped moving and returned to Lin Dong’s hands as a dark light.

“Wang Lie, the young master was bitten by dogs!”

“Yan Shu, the young master too…” People looked at Wang Lie and Yan Shu who were bitten by dogs. They couldn’t believe they would appear this way.

“Return!” Luo Tian addressed the two black dogs. The three dogs and the second black dog turned into a dark light, landing on Luo Tian’s wrist.

“What happened?” Everyone was confused. They looked at Luo Tian who stood fully dressed, the only one unharmed among over a hundred people.

“How many barriers are left?” Lin Dong held the black hall, now reduced to palm size. He glared at the thirty-six disciples of the Turn-Revolution Hall and shouted.

“It was Luo Chen. His dog swallowed the barriers…” One disciple spoke, voice trembling.

“Swallow your mother!” Lin Dong swung his hand and slapped the young man’s face, nearly killing him.

“Tell me… what exactly happened!” Lin Dong was furious. This massive mistake in the hall would make him face punishment upon returning to the Turn-Revolution Hall. How could he not be angry?

“It really was his black dog that swallowed them…” The thirty-six disciples of the Turn-Revolution Hall were almost crying as they spoke to Lin Dong.

“Nonsense. How could anything swallow the barriers!” Lin Dong didn’t believe it, but seeing their condition, he was doubtful.

“Master Lin, it was Luo Chen. He used his dogs to swallow the barriers. We tried our best to stop him, but he injured us with dishonorable means!” Zhang Tiantian’s voice echoed. He had just regained consciousness and saw Lin Dong’s angry face, immediately realizing the cause and shouting to blame Luo Tian.

“Luo Chen!” Wang Lie and Yan Shu looked at Luo Tian with teeth clenched, the biggest winner of this trial.

Not only did he win first place in the trial but also nearly stripped them of their treasures. How could people not hate Luo Tian?

“What did he do to make everyone hate him…” The people of the Beast Ghost King City looked at Luo Tian with admiration.

“He’s my master. To make these geniuses so angry, my master is truly a rare talent…” Zhang Menlie stood among the crowd, looking at Luo Tian.

“Um… it’s not my fault. You all volunteered…” Luo Tian quickly waved his hands to explain.

But before he finished speaking, a terrifying killing intent suddenly locked onto Luo Tian, causing his face to change instantly. The intensity of the killing intent was almost unprecedented in his life, making him feel a death threat. He couldn’t escape this final strike.

In an instant, Luo Tian entered combat mode. His hands formed a hundred and eight seals, and his one hundred and eight major acupoints emitted swirling energy—The Hundred Demons Sealing Technique.

“Explosions… explosions…” Explosions erupted from Luo Tian’s body. At the same time, that killing intent reached his vicinity. Everything happened in an instant; no one could react.

“Woo…” A golden sword was drawn by Chen Dao, his face darkened.

“Boom…” A thunderous explosion erupted from Luo Tian’s body. In the chaos, a middle-aged man appeared before Luo Tian. A black dagger transformed into a venomous snake and stabbed toward his back.

The middle-aged man was the one sent by the Heavenly Ghost King to retrieve the Beast Ghost King. He had been waiting for Luo Tian to exit the hall and strike him with a fatal blow.

The middle-aged man hadn’t expected Luo Tian to react so quickly, almost immediately after he moved.

A final strike from a late-stage True Immortal. Hidden in the shadows, even a late-stage True Immortal wouldn’t react as fast as Luo Tian.

Feeling the immense explosion power from Luo Tian, the middle-aged man still chose to strike. He only had one chance; Chen Dao’s sword intent had already captured his position.

The black dagger pierced Luo Tian’s back but was blocked by the explosion power, leaving only a two-inch wound without penetrating his heart. The middle-aged man spat blood and retreated immediately, though injured, it didn’t affect his speed.

“Die!” Chen Dao’s face darkened. He had known Luo Shui for a long time. They were once a team, and Luo Shui had saved him with his life. That was why Du Tianming kept Chen Dao; only Luo Shui could command him. And Luo Shui’s order was to protect his son, Luo Chen. But now someone was assassinating Luo Chen in front of him. How could he not be furious? He unleashed his peak True Immortal power and slashed into the sky without hesitation.

“Crack…” The sky was torn, blood spewed from it. That was where the middle-aged man fled.

“Take care of Luo Chen!” Chen Dao shouted to the Luo family members, then disappeared into the void.

The other person who reacted was Lin Dong. However, he was slightly slower than Chen Dao and didn’t hesitate. He waved his hand, and the four statues of the hall spat out dark energy, surrounding those lying on the ground. These people couldn’t withstand any impact.

Although this was slow, it happened quickly. People hadn’t reacted yet when the explosion energy before Luo Tian spread out.

“Rippling… rippling…” Black energy surged over the black barrier. After a hundred heartbeats, it calmed down.

People saw Luo Tian standing there, breathing heavily. Their eyes showed shock.

“What happened?” People were in a uproar, their eyes filled with strong shock. They hadn’t expected anyone to assassinate Luo Tian.

“Someone assassinated Luo Chen!” Someone shouted. The Luo family members immediately reacted, surrounding Luo Tian with pale faces and carefully watching the surroundings.

Luo Tian breathed heavily. His entire body felt like it had shattered. Although the Hundred Demons Sealing Technique was powerful, it also caused him significant damage.

“Thankfully, not fatal…” Luo Tian felt the cold chill on his back. If it had been anyone else, even a late-stage True Immortal, they would have bled to death. But Luo Tian had endured it.

“Super performance!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed relief. If he had reacted even a little slower, his life would have been lost.

“Master… your back injury!” The shouts of people made Luo Tian regain his senses. He looked at the shocked crowd around him.

“Not….” Before he could say “nothing,” Luo Tian’s face changed. He immediately formed the hundred and eight seals of the Hundred Demons Sealing Technique again, this time on himself. After sealing, he took out silver needles and repeatedly pierced his major acupoints.

“Carry me back to the Luo family. Hurry!” Luo Tian’s face was grim as he spoke to his family members. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to leave, but he couldn’t move now.

“Yes!” The Luo family members didn’t dare to delay. They quickly carried Luo Tian and rushed toward the Luo family.

“Who wanted to kill Luo Chen?” After the Luo family members left, people were in chaos.

“Terrifying. Even I couldn’t escape that assassination. He reacted first!” Lin Dong showed admiration, watching the Luo family leave.

“What?” Hearing Lin Dong’s words, people were even more shocked. Who was Lin Dong? A senior of the Turn-Revolution Hall, a late-stage True Immortal. If he couldn’t escape, Luo Tian had to be extraordinary.

“This bastard could escape. He’s dead!” Zhang Tiantian showed frustration, though he didn’t know who wanted to kill Luo Tian. He had hoped Luo Tian would die.

“You lost to him, it’s not a disgrace!” Lin Dong sighed deeply and turned toward the inn.

“Three days later, we’ll depart for the Turn-Revolution Hall. If you can’t come with us, he’ll have to go alone!” Lin Dong addressed the disciples of the Turn-Revolution Hall.

Chapter 2102: I’ll Do It Myself()

In the Luo family’s courtyard, Luo Shui looked worried. Luo Meng also frowned. Luo Tian had entered the Turn-Revolution Hall, which was a big event for the Luo family. But Luo Meng hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be poisoned by the Heavenly Net.

“Heavenly Net, Heaven’s Gate!” Luo Meng sighed deeply and looked at Luo Tian’s room.

“He won’t survive seven days. It has already been one day. Even if I left this place, it would take at least ten days to reach the Heavenly Ghost City. Plus, the Heavenly Ghost King definitely wouldn’t save him! Prepare for his funeral!” Luo Meng sighed deeply, voice filled with helplessness and anger.

It was a rare opportunity for a younger generation to enter the Turn-Revolution Hall, but it was useless. He would still die.

“It’s my fault. I’ve failed Shui’s expectations!” Chen Dao looked guilty, returning half a day ago with the head of a late-stage True Immortal.

“It’s not your fault. I know your character. It’s just that Chen’s fate is bad!” Luo Shui sighed.

After returning, Luo Tian didn’t let them in. He said he would find a solution himself. But everyone knew there was no way out.

However, Luo Shui still had hope that a miracle would happen. After all, Luo Tian had once broken the Burial Immortal Poison. Though it wasn’t as strong as the Heavenly Net Poison, it had made Luo Tian suffer for years.

“Elder, Xiao Dao, you two go. I’ll watch over him here!” Luo Shui addressed them and walked to the door of Luo Tian’s room, sitting down in meditation, waiting for Luo Tian to appear.

Time passed slowly. One day had slipped by without a sound from Luo Tian’s room, but the whole Beast Ghost King City was talking about Luo Tian.

First place in the Turn-Revolution Hall trial, leading the pack. Even the disciples of the Turn-Revolution Hall had suffered.

“Hearing that Luo Chen extorted everyone during the trial, even the disciples of the Turn-Revolution Hall weren’t spared. He’s really bold!”

“That’s nothing. Afterward, he even resisted a late-stage True Immortal’s assassination!” People whispered, now placing Luo Tian on the same level as Wang Lie and others. In fact, he had surpassed them.

“Unfortunately, it was all for nothing. He rose so quickly only to fall. The dagger of that late-stage True Immortal was coated with the Heavenly Net Poison, a poison crafted by the Heavenly Ghost King. No one in the world could cure it except the Heavenly Ghost King. Even the Beast Ghost King could only suppress and prolong his life!”

“Hearing that the Luo family’s elder and head went to beg the Beast Ghost King, but they came out empty-handed. The Beast Ghost King didn’t suppress the poison for Luo Tian!”

“I heard it was because Luo Tian wouldn’t part with those two dogs, so the Beast Ghost King refused to suppress the poison!”

“Luo Chen should have lived a few more days. What if there was a way?” People discussed, some pitying Luo Tian and others showing joy. After all, Luo Tian’s reputation was infamous—killing his own brother. Though such things happened in hell, they were rare.

In a luxurious inn, the entire place was occupied by the Turn-Revolution Hall. Lin Dong’s face showed anger as he looked at the thirty-six disciples of the Turn-Revolution Hall.

“You’ve really grown up. You’re such a disgrace!” Lin Dong cursed the thirty-six disciples, who lowered their heads.

They returned to the inn. Lin Dong used his methods to see what happened in the hall, witnessing the actions of the Turn-Revolution Hall disciples.

Normally, there were cases where Turn-Revolution Hall disciples extorted others. But Lin Dong hadn’t expected these bastards to be extorted, ending up injured.

Embarrassing, shameful. This would disgrace the Turn-Revolution Hall. If it spread, Lin Dong’s face and the hall’s reputation would be ruined.

“You wanted revenge. I understand. But you let them toy with you and were extorted completely! I’m ashamed to be associated with you!”

“I’ll take responsibility for the barrier issue. Return to the Turn-Revolution Hall and train hard!” Lin Dong roared, looking like he was angry at his own failure.

“His poison is the Heavenly Net. He won’t live seven days. We don’t need to wait for him. I’ll return to the Turn-Revolution Hall tomorrow morning…” Lin Dong spoke with helplessness. The situation had reached this point, and he had no solution.

In Lin Dong’s view, it was a pity for a promising talent. But their goal had already been achieved; they didn’t care about Luo Tian’s life or death.

“Deserved! Let those spiritual crystals and treasures buy his life!” The thirty-six disciples of the Turn-Revolution Hall showed joy, cheering inwardly.

At the same time, Yan Shu and Chen Tianzhou among other trial participants also cheered.

“Didn’t he get a bad fate? I wonder if the Turn-Revolution Hall will recruit again!” People showed some hope.

“Should we go mock that kid? He’s already in such a pitiful state. Why not make him suffer more?” After Lin Dong scolded the disciples, they showed their frustration.

“Good. I think we shouldn’t just do it ourselves. We should also invite the people of the Beast Ghost King!” Zhang Tiantian showed excitement. Though he heard Luo Tian wouldn’t live seven days, he still wanted to see his pitiful state to relieve his hatred.

……

In a luxurious room, Luo Tian’s face was serious. The roar of the dragon and elephant echoed, and his one hundred and eight major acupoints emitted swirling energy, forming black whirlpools.

“Next is the silver needle acupuncture!” Luo Tian’s lips twitched. Through the Dragon and Elephant Sealing Technique, he had regained mobility. But the Heavenly Net Poison was extremely fierce. Even this miraculous technique could only suppress it temporarily.

Luo Tian sighed deeply, his eyes filled with a bitter smile.

Silver needle acupuncture was a pain for Luo Tian. Even now, he still couldn’t find the right spot.

But at this moment, he had no choice but to take out the silver needles and insert them into his one hundred and eight acupoints opened by the Hundred Demons Sealing Technique.

“Ah…” A painful scream echoed in Luo Tian’s room. It made Luo Shui immediately stand up, looking at the door of Luo Tian’s room.

Because his one hundred and eight acupoints were open, he was more sensitive to pain. The pain exceeded before.

“Chen’er, what’s wrong?” Luo Shui shouted, voice filled with anxiety. He felt his “son” was becoming more and more mysterious to him.

“N-no… th-thing…” Luo Tian’s trembling voice echoed in the room, deepening Luo Shui’s concern. However, he didn’t enter Luo Tian’s room but watched the door anxiously, his spiritual awareness covering the entire room.

“Ah…” The agonizing scream echoed continuously in the room. Even with Luo Shui’s spiritual awareness covering it, it caught the attention of the Luo family members.

These two days had been like a rollercoaster for the Luo family. Luo Chen killed his brother, making the family uncomfortable.

But then, Luo Tian passed the Turn-Revolution Hall trial. All participants, including the disciples of the Turn-Revolution Hall, emerged in a collapsed state. This made the Luo family extremely excited.

Because Luo Tian had entered the Turn-Revolution Hall, the Luo family could surpass the other two families in the Beast Ghost King City.

But before they had time to celebrate, an assassination had made the Luo family fall from heaven to earth.

People knew that the Heavenly Net Poison was almost incurable. Even the Beast Ghost King could only suppress it, but no one could cure it except the Heavenly Ghost King.

Who was the Heavenly Ghost King? The father of Duan Peizhen. Duan Peizhen died at Luo Shui’s hands. He would never cure Luo Tian.

“This sound… it comes from the young master’s courtyard!” The Luo family members heard the agonizing scream and looked toward the direction of Luo Tian’s courtyard.

“It must be the Heavenly Net Poison acting up. Making the young master so painful!” The Luo family members whispered, eyes filled with pity.

“Ah… Ah…” That night, the screams continued. The hellish night had no light, only darkness. These screams made even the people of hell who were used to hearing ghostly cries feel uneasy.
