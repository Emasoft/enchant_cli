Jiang Sxi’s face bore an endless coldness. In these years, when had she ever suffered such treatment? Yet she had been outwitted by a mere Boundary Lord.

With a flick of her hand, four currents of Original Power burst forth from her fingers, transforming into sharp blades that instantly materialized before the four men’s eyes.

Not a moment's pause—each of their eyes instantly became crimson voids, crying out in ceaseless agony.

Luo Tian, witnessing Jiang Sxi’s technique, instinctively blinked and took a step back without uttering a word. These four men truly deserved death; perhaps even Gu Qianxue or Leng Qiuchan would have been more ruthless than Jiang Sxi.

As Luo Tian pondered, four currents of Original Power shot forth again from Jiang Sxi’s hands, forming four tempests that slashed endlessly across the four men's bodies. Shreds of flesh scattered in Luo Tian’s vision, and the cries of the four men summoned the attendants and servants who fled with expressions of terror.

“Go back!” Jiang Sxi’s face remained icy as she barked at the servants. If these four hadn’t been fully tortured yet, these attendants would have already faced Jiang Sxi’s wrath.

Each disciple and attendant dared not delay, bowing tremblingly before departing. Only Luo Tian, Jiang Sxi, and the four bloodied men—whose bodies were riddled with falling flesh—remained.

At this moment, the four men had no strength left to speak; their entire bodies were mere heaps of bone and blood, a sight so pitiful it was unbearable.

“Come forth!” Jiang Sxi extended her hand, and a soul manifested within Luo Tian and Jiang Sxi’s line of sight.

“Soul-Search!” Jiang Sxi sneered, snatching the soul with her hand. A cascade of memories flooded her mind, intensifying her murderous intent.

She did not spare the four men; four souls materialized in her grasp, revealing all their deeds within her mind.

“Coward!” Jiang Sxi sneered at Luo Tian, “Burn it with your ancestral fire. If you don’t complete the seven-seven-fourty-nine days, I’ll peel your skin off!”

Luo Tian’s brow furrowed slightly. He seized one of the four souls and initiated a soul-search, his eyes soon brimming with murderous intent. The碧green flames of his ancestral fire enveloped the four souls.

It transpired that over these years, Ding Hetong and his men had lived like emperors on the Eastern Peace Continent, forcibly seizing countless women. Worse still, Ding Hetong had变态ly killed each woman he captured.

The wails of anguish echoed ceaselessly within Jiang Sxi’s chamber, softening her gaze momentarily. She glanced at Luo Tian, but the next instant noticed Luo Tian’s eyes also fixed on her.

“Hmph…” Luo Tian exhaled deeply, his mind haunted by the image of Jiang Sxi’s torn clothing. Cursing his own weak will, he smiled slightly and prepared to speak to Jiang Sxi.

In an instant, he saw Jiang Sxi’s face flushed with redness, her gaze becoming hazy as she approached him.

“Love potion!” Luo Tian’s mind instantly conjured a dreadful thought, scanning the room until he spotted a pile of burned incense ash near Jiang Sxi’s window. A bitter smile crossed his face.

“Damn it, these four truly deserve death!” Jiang Sxi panted softly, wrapping her arms around Luo Tian and rubbing against him.

After the events of this night, Jiang Sxi was exhausted, her willpower clearly weakened.

Cultivators could dispel any poison with their qi, but this love potion was an exception—Luo Tian and Jiang Sxi both understood this.

If they had been poisoned for a little longer, their strong wills might have restrained it. But now, the time had passed too long; the love potion’s effects were fully unleashed.

“Damn it! What do I do?” Luo Tian roared低声.

“Take me…” Jiang Sxi’s gaze was hazy, her voice dripping with endless temptation as she addressed Luo Tian.

Even with his strong will, Luo Tian was a young man of fiery passion. How could he withstand it? He let out a low growl, lifting Jiang Sxi who was entwined around him and vanishing from Jiang Sxi’s chamber into his luxurious room.

Chapter 777: Sha Cangmang's Plan ()

Chapter 777: Sha Cangmang's Plan

At dawn, the golden sun slowly rose, piercing through the window slats to illuminate a luxurious bed. On it lay two bare bodies, breathing evenly as they slept.

A moment later, seemingly the sunlight had pierced their eyes or some part of them reacted, causing both to open their eyes simultaneously.

They stared at each other for a moment before both mouths formed an “O” shape, their shouts shattering the morning silence.

“Boom…” In an instant, a figure transformed into a streak of light, crashing violently against the pillar in the room. A pillar so thick that several people could not encircle it was instantly shattered into rubble, burying the figure.

“Luo… Tian…” Jiang Sxi’s teeth clenched as she spoke, her face contorted with madness. She gazed at the buried Luo Tian.

Quickly pulling on a robe, she闪身 to the broken pillar’s front, her face cold.

Though Jiang Sxi moved swiftly, Luo Tian was no slower. With a “boom,” the rubble scattered, and Luo Tian, his face filled with anger, stood up from the debris.

But Jiang Sxi and Luo Tian had forgotten one thing: Luo Tian was still naked.

“Boom…” Before Luo Tian could react, Jiang Sxi kicked him again, sending him flying. Her face flushed red as she turned away.

“Put on your clothes before coming to see me!” Jiang Sxi’s cold voice echoed, and her figure vanished from Luo Tian’s room.

“Pfah…” Jiang Sxi’s figure had just disappeared when Luo Tian leapt from the rubble, spitting out blood. He wanted to curse but didn’t know how to start.

“Sorry, Qianxue, Qiuchan, and Yunting!” Luo Tian smiled bitterly, gently touching the Nourishing Soul Jade at his waist. A deep sense of guilt filled his heart.

“My first time was so haphazard!” Luo Tian inwardly cursed, his face showing an unwilling expression.

“What the hell will I say when I meet those two girls later!” Luo Tian cursed, putting on his clothes and heading toward Jiang Sxi’s courtyard. No matter what, he had to face it. Luo Tian repeatedly encouraged himself, stepping into Jiang Sxi’s room slowly.

The bloodstains from the previous night in Jiang Sxi’s chamber had vanished, leaving only four balls of碧green flames burning the four screaming souls. Luo Tian’s face showed anger.

Jiang Sxi sat on a chair, her eyes meeting Luo Tian as he entered. An unusual atmosphere filled the room.

“Um…”

“You can rest easy; I’ll take responsibility. After all, I’m a man and won’t abandon my responsibilities. Though it was you who initiated it last night, I’ll still take full responsibility!” Luo Tian, being a man, calmed his emotions and spoke softly. His gaze met Jiang Sxi’s, now with a touch of tenderness.

Hearing Luo Tian’s words, Jiang Sxi blushed, cursing inwardly: “What do you mean by me initiating it? It sounds like you’re the one who suffered!”

Yet, for some reason, recalling last night’s frenzy made Jiang Sxi’s heart strangely stirred. If it were anyone else, she would have already killed them without hesitation, regardless of who they were.

After returning to her room and calming herself, Jiang Sxi had planned to kill Luo Tian the moment he arrived.

But when Luo Tian entered, she hesitated. Though angry, for some reason, she couldn’t bring herself to do it.

Jiang Sxi was the top genius of the Four Sacred Star Domains. After calming herself, her face turned cold: “Rest easy; I won’t hold you to it. After all, last night was unavoidable. From now on, don’t mention this again. My only wish is for you to leave the Eastern Peace Continent and never appear in my sight again!”

Hearing Jiang Sxi’s words, Luo Tian paused. Seeing the coldness in her eyes, he spoke softly: “I can’t. Whether you care or not, I do. From now on, you are one of my wives. Who dares to harm you, I’ll kill them!”

Luo Tian finished, his gaze filled with determination as he looked at Jiang Sxi.

Hearing the first part of Luo Tian’s words, Jiang Sxi was furious: “What do you mean by me not caring? And ‘one of my wives’?” But upon hearing his latter words, her expression softened slightly.

“With your current strength? Ha! You can’t even beat me. Wait until you gain strength, then come back!”

Jiang Sxi spoke, her hand grasping Ding Hetong’s soul. The gray soul bore a weary expression.

“Boom…” She crushed Ding Hetong’s soul, her gaze cold as she looked at Luo Tian. Furthermore, Jiang Sxi lightly flicked her fingers, sending currents of Original Power from her hands flying out into the air, scattering in all directions.

“Ah…” A scream echoed as more Qinglong Sect disciples and attendants were pierced by the Original Power, dying at Jiang Sxi’s hands.

Seeing Jiang Sxi’s actions, Luo Tian sighed. He knew these people were close to Ding Hetong and had aided him in wrongdoing.

“Fine, I’ll go. But remember: from today on, you are mine, Luo Tian. When my cultivation surpasses yours, I’ll return!” Luo Tian knew that to have Jiang Sxi accept him, his strength had to be formidable.

Jiang Sxi was a Six-Source Heavenly Lord; he was still a Five-Source. Though only one Original Power separated them, an insurmountable chasm remained. Jiang Sxi was also a genius; when he achieved Six-Source, she would progress as well.

“Go! I’m in a bad mood now!” Jiang Sxi, annoyed by Luo Tian’s words, spoke with impatience.

“Okay! Remember to protect yourself!” Luo Tian turned and stepped out of Jiang Sxi’s door.

Seeing Luo Tian vanish from his sight, Jiang Sxi seemed to lose all strength, slowly walking toward the chair.

“Woo…” A ripple spread as a strong arm suddenly embraced Jiang Sxi from behind, and a familiar voice echoed in her ear.

“Remember what I said!” The voice faded, leaving a mix of familiarity and unfamiliarity.

Jiang Sxi’s face bore a smile. From her storage ring, she took out a bedsheet with faint bloodstains, resembling a blooming plum blossom.

Then she saw the three souls wrapped in碧Jing琉璃fire, her face showing endless coldness: “Ke Xin Die, you brought this upon yourself. Don’t blame me!”

…

Luo Tian walked through the void, his face bearing a complex expression. He gently touched the Nourishing Soul Jade at his waist, whispering: “Ah, what should I do?”

“Boy, you’ve advanced to Five-Source Lord. Return to Qinglong Sect and accept your cultivation!” Sha Cangmang’s voice echoed in the Binding God Band, interrupting Luo Tian’s complex thoughts.

“Cultivation! I never expected my performance in the ranking battle would earn me such a gift from Sha Cangmang. He must be determined!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with endless coldness, his feet stepping through the void toward the Qinglong Continent.

The Eastern Peace Continent was under Qinglong Sect’s jurisdiction, though distant. Luo Tian returned to the Qinglong Sect within a day.

The Qinglong Sect disciples and attendants looked at Luo Tian with respect, constantly greeting him. Especially the attendants, seeing the golden headband on his head, showed immense reverence. At this moment, Luo Tian had become a faith-like figure for the Qinglong Sect’s attendants.

As soon as Luo Tian stepped into the Qinglong Sect, Sha Cangmang appeared before him, a smile on his face. No one noticed the complex expression in Sha Cangmang’s eyes.

“Supreme Lord!”

“Master!” Luo Tian and the disciples bowed to Sha Cangmang, their faces showing respect.

“Come.” Sha Cangmang spoke, leading Luo Tian deeper into the Qinglong Sect.

Luo Tian bore a respectful expression, but a strong sense of crisis stirred within him. This was the fifth time since his cultivation journey that he felt such a danger, each one a life-threatening crisis. He had barely escaped each time.

“Ah, well… fate is what it is.” Luo Tian sighed internally. He had considered fleeing but was trapped by the cursed Binding God Band, leaving no place to run within the Four Sacred Star Domains.

As they walked, Sha Cangmang led Luo Tian to a place resembling an altar. Countless runes enveloped the altar, emitting an ancient and solemn aura that shook Luo Tian’s mind.

The four Seven-Source Heavenly Lords of the Qinglong Sect sat in the four corners of the altar. When Luo Tian and Sha Cangmang approached, they all opened their eyes, expressions of joy.

On the altar stood a black cauldron covered in intricate patterns, seemingly capable of subduing the heavens. Compared to Luo Tian’s Pacifying Soul Cauldron, it was far heavier.

“Begin! Luo Tian, enter the cauldron and receive our Qinglong Sect’s greatest cultivation!” Sha Cangmang smiled, gazing at Luo Tian with excitement.

Luo Tian felt an immense frustration. His perception told him that once he entered the black cauldron, it would be ten deaths and no chance of survival. Yet facing Sha Cangmang and the four Seven-Source Lords, he knew he had no choice.

“If I don’t die, I’ll rebel against the Qinglong Sect!” Luo Tian roared internally. He stepped onto the altar, standing before the towering black cauldron, like a tiny ant.

Chapter 778: Cultivating the Body ()

Seeing Luo Tian obediently step onto the altar, the four Seven-Source Lords moved their hands rapidly. Powerful Original Power surged from each Lord’s hands, striking the black cauldron.

“Woo…” The lid of the cauldron lifted, darkening the sky. The entire Qinglong Sect’s skies seemed to turn dark, even the cauldron’s top had no light, as if devoured by it.

“Enter!” Sha Cangmang urged Luo Tian, who hesitated before biting his lip and stepping onto the black cauldron. A wave of fear filled Luo Tian’s mind, a feeling akin to a lamb entering a tiger’s mouth.

“Enter!” The four Seven-Source Lords struck their hands, and the black cauldron’s lid fell, as if crushing Luo Tian. They pushed him into the black cauldron.

Endless darkness filled Luo Tian’s vision. He extended his spiritual sense but found no special features in the cauldron, calming his mind.

“Begin!”

Sha Cangmang was excited, standing before the black cauldron and addressing the four Seven-Source Lords.

With Sha Cangmang’s command, the old men moved their hands again. Their Original Power flowed like water from their bodies, forming radiant runes that drifted across the altar.

“Woo…” The massive altar activated instantly, with countless runes forming long dragons that slithered across the altar. A heart-stirring aura spread from the altar.

Sha Cangmang remained still, his moment not yet arrived.

“Woo…” The rune dragons finally reached the Pacifying Soul Cauldron, sending out ripples that made Luo Tian feel it within.

Luo Tian raised his guard, his face serious and tense, guarding against any danger.

But in an instant, a terrifying sense of separation emerged from Luo Tian’s body, causing his face to change.

Luo Tian felt his soul being gradually pulled from his body, even as he resisted desperately, it was futile.

“Damn!” Luo Tian roared, watching his soul leave his body and drift in endless darkness.

At the moment Luo Tian’s soul left, his physical eyes closed, floating within the black cauldron.

At the moment Luo Tian’s soul and body separated, Sha Cangmang smiled slightly, extending his hand to throw a seven-colored Original Flame into the black cauldron.

At the same time, the four Seven-Source Lords stood up, lifting the cauldron’s lid again. They waved their sleeves, throwing precious herbs into it, causing the fire within to surge.

“Begin! Forge this body and refine Luo Tian’s flesh into an Eight-Source Lord. Once his physical strength is powerful, he can be guided!” Sha Cangmang’s voice carried an ancient tone. The four Seven-Source Lords also stood solemnly, their cultivation radiating to open Luo Tian’s pores.

A moment later, countless herbs turned into liquid under the flames, filling the cauldron completely. Under Sha Cangmang’s Original Flame, it boiled rapidly.

Countless herbal essences poured into Luo Tian’s flesh, refining his body.

Luo Tian could only watch this scene, even now facing a life-threatening crisis. Sha Cangmang’s Original Flame tormented him immensely, though he was far away, it still affected him.

Luo Tian’s soul endured endless torment, constantly weakening.

“Not good! If this continues, I’ll definitely be soul-destroyed!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed calculation. He thought of ways to save himself, realizing now that Sha Cangmang valued his body and nine-element体质.

“Possession!” A familiar word echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, causing his gray soul to tremble.

“Pacifying Soul Cauldron!” Luo Tian’s gray eyes flashed with madness, his mind rushing into his storage ring to summon the Pacifying Soul Cauldron. Without hesitation, his gray soul rushed into it. At this moment, Luo Tian had no other options but to gamble on the Pacifying Soul Cauldron to preserve his soul.

“Woo…” As Luo Tian’s soul entered the Pacifying Soul Cauldron, he saw two white figures—Zhao Fengshan and his wife.

“Luo Tian!” Seeing Luo Tian’s soul enter the Pacifying Soul Cauldron, Zhao Fengshan and his wife showed surprise.

“Master Zhao!” Luo Tian hadn’t expected to see Zhao Fengshan and his wife in this form.

Zhao Fengshan and his wife’s souls were more solid than when Luo Tian first met them. He could sense their soul’s strength.

“What happened?” Zhao Fengshan asked, his gaze filled with confusion.

“Master Zhao, I never expected to see you under these circumstances!” Luo Tian smiled bitterly, looking at Zhao Fengshan and recounting the events.

Hearing Luo Tian’s account, Zhao Fengshan and his wife were stunned. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to have reached such a level, even leaving the Xiantian and Tianyuan Continents.

Zhao Fengshan and his wife also knew that, including themselves, the three of them were now facing a life-threatening crisis.

“Ah… let’s see if the Pacifying Soul Cauldron can hold out! If it fails, we three will be completely soul-destroyed!” Zhao Fengshan spoke, his voice carrying concern.

Zhao Fengshan and his wife weren’t too concerned about their own lives; they had already died once. But they were worried about Luo Tian, who was their savior. They didn’t want to see him die so young.

“Six-Source Lord!” Sha Cangmang smiled, sensing the strength of Luo Tian’s flesh within the black cauldron. He increased his Original Power output, making the black cauldron’s temperature even more violent.

“Boom…” As Sha Cangmang intensified his fire, Luo Tian’s clothes gradually tore open. Even his storage ring on his body shattered, releasing countless treasures into the refining process.

Clinking sounds echoed as weapons from the storage ring fell into the cauldron. Countless qi stones melted under this terrifying temperature, turning into liquid and settling at the cauldron’s bottom.

Luo Tian and Zhao Fengshan’s souls sighed, the Pacifying Soul Cauldron now a top-tier treasure. There were no problems, and their lives were temporarily safe.

But in an instant, Luo Tian’s gray eyes showed endless terror. His perception detected a crystalline jade tablet melting slowly—Luo Tian’s Nourishing Soul Jade, worn for years.

“Yunting!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with madness. He could feel Chen Yuting’s half-soul in the Nourishing Soul Jade, showing extreme pain.

Without hesitation, Luo Tian’s face showed madness, ignoring Zhao Fengshan and his wife’s warnings. He rushed out of the Pacifying Soul Cauldron, his gray soul rushing toward the Nourishing Soul Jade.

“Ah…” At the moment Luo Tian’s soul appeared, he felt the terrifying temperature’s damage. Even he couldn’t withstand half an hour.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian was again in a dilemma. Chen Yuting’s soul wasn’t as strong as his, and it was only half a soul. Luo Tian knew that the moment Chen Yuting’s soul appeared, it would be evaporated by this terrifying temperature.

“I won’t let you die again!” His soul, filled with endless madness, fiercely punched in the herbal liquid.

“Reincarnation!” Luo Tian unleashed a series of reincarnation punches, his face showing intense sorrow. If souls could cry, Luo Tian would be weeping now.

“Woo…” Finally, after Luo Tian’s relentless efforts, a reincarnation passage appeared before him. A powerful suction pulled at his soul.

“I’ll find you!” Luo Tian’s eyes showed intense sorrow, watching the gray soul of Chen Yuting rush into the reincarnation passage.

This was Luo Tian’s only idea—sending Chen Yuting’s soul into reincarnation, otherwise she would be soul-destroyed in this cauldron.

Chen Yuting’s soul had already been half-annihilated by Yang Huanyu. If this half vanished, she would have no chance of survival.

The white soul showed a touch of sorrow and longing, gazing at Luo Tian for an instant before being absorbed into the reincarnation passage.

“Woo…” Luo Tian watched Chen Yuting’s soul enter the reincarnation passage, gradually returning to the Pacifying Soul Cauldron. His eyes carried a coldness.

Chen Yuting had been Luo Tian’s obsession for years. Now, she was fully in reincarnation, and even as a half-soul, it shattered Luo Tian’s obsession. And the mastermind behind this was Sha Cangmang and the Qinglong Sect’s four Lords.

“Wait… no matter your intentions, I won’t let you succeed!” Luo Tian whispered, his eyes flashing with murder.

Though Luo Tian was inside the Pacifying Soul Cauldron, he could feel his physical body growing stronger.

Zhao Fengshan and his wife watched Luo Tian standing coldly, not disturbing him. Zhao Fengshan could understand Luo Tian’s feelings; he had experienced this situation before.

Time passed slowly, and soon fifteen days had gone by. The herbal liquid in the cauldron was nearly dry, and Luo Tian’s body absorbed it endlessly.

Chapter 779: Nine-Source Heavenly Lord Body ()

In the Qinglong Sect, on the altar, the black cauldron continuously churned with herbal essences, pouring into Luo Tian’s body. The powerful aura caused the cauldron’s sky to tremble constantly.

“Seven-Source! This nine-element体质 is truly extraordinary. So many herbs only refined it to a Seven-Source Heavenly Lord body!” Sha Cangmang and the four Lords showed astonishment.

Having lived countless years, Sha Cangmang knew that the more herbal essences one absorbed, the greater their potential. Now Luo Tian had absorbed so many herbs and only reached a Seven-Source Heavenly Lord body, showing how terrifying his potential was.

“An arrow shot cannot be retrieved; since we’ve decided to abandon Luo Tian, we must continue!” Sha Cangmang’s eyes flickered with complex emotions before showing decisiveness.

“Don’t worry; our Qinglong Sect has infinite resources. The more he absorbs, the stronger he will become!” They spoke, their eyes showing no regret as they waved their hands again, throwing countless herbs into the cauldron.

With a roar, the herbal liquid rose again, filling the cauldron and submerging Luo Tian’s body. His body was like a bottomless hole, constantly absorbing the concentrated herbal essences, making his flesh stronger.

At the bottom of the black cauldron was a small black cauldron, barely noticeable—Luo Tian’s Pacifying Soul Cauldron.

At this moment, Luo Tian and Zhao Fengshan’s souls were inside the Pacifying Soul Cauldron. They watched, feeling the terrifying power of Luo Tian’s body and sighed lightly.

“Seven-Source Heavenly Lord body! Sha Cangmang wants to refine my body so strong. I wonder what their expressions will be when they realize all this effort was for me alone.” Luo Tian licked his lips, his gray eyes flashing with intense light.

Another month passed, and Luo Tian’s body had reached Eight-Source—reaching Sha Cangmang’s expected level.

“Still absorbing!” They had thought Luo Tian’s body could reach Eight-Source as the limit, but they hadn’t expected it to continue absorbing herbal essences after reaching Eight-Source.

“This is the刑天草 I cultivated for five thousand years; give it to him! Everything for transcendence!”

“This is the dragon horn of Qinglong Sect’s divine beast, Qinglong. I’ll give it to him! Hope that when the next Supreme Lord revives, he can directly break through to Nine-Source!”

Including Sha Cangmang, their faces were somewhat grim. Yet they showed flashes of light in their eyes. The stronger Luo Tian’s body, the more powerful the Qinglong Sect would become. They gritted their teeth and continued throwing treasures into the black cauldron, refining the miraculous herbal liquid to refine Luo Tian’s body.

“I won’t let it be that we’ve gathered all the resources of Qinglong Sect and still can’t refine a Nine-Source Heavenly Lord body!” Sha Cangmang gritted his teeth, watching the herbal liquid flow into Luo Tian’s body.

But time passed slowly for a month, and Luo Tian’s body still showed no signs of reaching Nine-Source. It continued absorbing the endless herbal liquid without reaction.

Sha Cangmang and the others’ faces finally turned grim. In this month, they had thrown all their treasures into the cauldron, but Luo Tian’s body showed no reaction.

“Damn it! Is a Nine-Source body really that hard to achieve!” Sha Cangmang’s eyes turned blood-red, his gaze filled with madness as he looked at Luo Tian floating in the cauldron.

“I feel like we’re filling a big pit!” One of the Seven-Source Lords spoke, his gaze filled with bitterness and exhaustion.

These days, countless herbs were not even mentioned; just their own cultivation had been drained to seven-eighths. Yet Luo Tian’s body showed no reaction.

Luo Tian stood inside the Pacifying Soul Cauldron, his gray eyes flashing with light. Though his soul was separated, he still had some connection to his body and could slightly control it.

At this moment, Luo Tian knew that if he wanted to, his body could become a Nine-Source Heavenly Lord.

But Luo Tian didn’t want to; he wanted to see how much potential his body had and also hold hatred for Sha Cangmang.

“Celestial Power!” The external Sha Cangmang and others finally used the celestial power only a Heavenly Lord could access, pouring it into Luo Tian’s body. This was their last resort since the Qinglong Sect and their own treasures were nearly exhausted.

As they moved, the entire Qinglong Sect and even the Qinglong Continent’s celestial power flowed into Luo Tian’s body under their control.

“Refine!” At the moment the celestial power entered his body, Luo Tian knew his body had transformed.

Luo Tian’s meridians were crushed and restructured after this celestial power entered, with each meridian and blood vessel reappearing. A heavy heartbeat echoed within the black cauldron.

With each of Luo Tian’s heartbeats, waves of herbal liquid surged in the cauldron. Luo Tian floated like a jade stone within the black cauldron, faintly emitting an ancient aura, as if a primordial beast was slowly awakening.

The sky churned; in the starry void outside the Qinglong Continent, clouds collided constantly. A twisted vortex appeared beyond the Qinglong Continent, continuously flowing toward it. The vortex’s end was at the Qinglong Sect’s altar.

“What’s happening!” The Qinglong Sect elders felt a tremor, gazing at the overwhelming power that could crush the entire Qinglong Mountain.

But the sect’s disciples felt nothing; only Heavenly Lords could sense this terrifying pressure and vortex.

Not just the Qinglong Sect was shaken, but Xuanwu’s old tortoise opened its eyes at this moment. Its eyes flashed with intense light, as if seeing the scene on the Qinglong Continent through infinite voids.

“Sha Cangmang, I hope you don’t regret it!” Xuanwu’s old tortoise whispered and then slowly closed its eyes, leisurely drifting through the void.

On the Zhuque Continent, Zhuque Sect’s Ke Zhen Tian showed a surprised expression, his gaze turning dark: “I never expected Sha Cangmang to act so early. I wonder if he chose to possess himself or…”

“Has it started? Damn it, once Sha Cangmang succeeds, the entire Four Sacred Star Domains will be under Qinglong Sect’s control!” Baihu Sect’s Jin Yongsi’s face was dark, his gaze piercing through the void toward the distance.

All the sect masters and ancestors across the Four Sacred Star Domains felt Qinglong Sect’s changes, their faces showing shock as they gazed toward the Qinglong Continent.

“It’s done! A Nine-Source Heavenly Lord body!” Sha Cangmang and others showed joy, their spiritual senses probing the black cauldron.

“Perfect!” Sha Cangmang and others were equally stunned, unable to find words to describe Luo Tian’s body in their spiritual senses.

“Luo Tian’s soul must have already vanished, a pity for such a good talent! Blame it on you being from the Tianyuan Continent!” Sha Cangmang sighed, then stopped speaking. He moved his hands, sending out a series of runes again.

At the same time, the herbal liquid within the cauldron was completely absorbed by Luo Tian’s body. His body had fully entered the Nine-Source Heavenly Lord realm, floating within the black cauldron.

Luo Tian stood inside the Pacifying Soul Cauldron, his gaze cold. If it weren’t for the Pacifying Soul Cauldron, he would have already died.

Countless runes flowed from Sha Cangmang’s hands into the black cauldron, wrapping Luo Tian’s body. The black cauldron’s surroundings lit up with flowing symbols, and a deep voice echoed within the empty cauldron.

“Qinglong… Holy Body… True Nine-Source!” The voice echoed, causing Luo Tian’s brows to furrow slightly. His gaze held confusion.

“Let the soul of the Supreme Lord awaken! This is the body we prepared for you. Lead the Qinglong Sect to glory! Lead us to transcend!” Sha Cangmang’s voice carried a deep tone, his words echoing.

“Qinglong Sect’s Supreme Lord!” Luo Tian remained calm, never expecting the Qinglong Sect, an ancient entity, still existed in this world.

“Woo…” The humming sound echoed within the black cauldron, illuminating the entire dark space with golden symbols. A gray figure appeared within the black cauldron, ancient and solemn, instantly invading Luo Tian’s and the three souls’ minds.

“It has appeared!” Sha Cangmang showed excitement, bowing respectfully. His years of planning had finally succeeded, finding a suitable body for the Supreme Lord and refining the legendary Qinglong Holy Body.

The Qinglong Holy Body, a body only a Supreme Lord could possess—Sha Cangmang hadn’t expected they would refine the legendary Qinglong Holy Body of a Supreme Lord.

Sha Cangmang’s powerful spiritual sense entered the cauldron, confirming there was no soul within Luo Tian’s body. He stood respectfully beside the cauldron.
