“Luo Brother, what ails you? Have you gone mad?” The barbarians’ faces bore confusion; they wished to investigate, but all were intercepted by Chu Chen.

What relieved Luo Tian was that his agonized cry had not, like in the Starlight Divine Clan, provoked resentment. After all, he was still an ordinary mortal; his voice lacked potency. Compared to Luo Tian’s wails, the barbarians’ thunderous snoring was far more formidable.

Time flowed steadily. The people of Nanling knew nothing of the events within the Barbarian God Palace, only that Chu Chen had entered the Early Epoch—a great joy. They continued their lives as usual.

For these days, Luo Tian had not appeared before the people except for meals. Each time he dined, his presence felt subtly different; his complexion grew increasingly ruddy, and his aura surged.

Days passed uneventfully until the twentieth day, when Luo Tian sat cross-legged in his chamber, sweat pouring from his brow. His eyes gleamed with joy as resounding booms echoed within him.

Through relentless study, Luo Tian had finally solidified his meridians. Though not fully restored to their former state, they were leagues stronger than when he was an ordinary mortal.

His cultivation ascended with unstoppable momentum, swiftly reaching the Epoch Stage.

“Early Epoch… Mid-Epoch… Late Epoch…” Yet when Luo Tian reached the Late Epoch, his cultivation stalled. He slowly opened his eyes.

“With this cultivation’s nourishment, my blood and qi will recover swiftly. Once my meridians are fully restored, the time shall be brief,” Luo Tian murmured, withdrawing his silver needles.

“Next, I must rely on cultivation to accelerate recovery. I hope to be fully restored within ten days,” Luo Tian smiled, then resumed his cross-legged meditation.

“Luo Brother…” Before Luo Tian could begin, a thunderous voice echoed outside his courtyard. A towering barbarian, face etched with anxiety, peered cautiously. Chu Chen had previously instructed not to disturb Luo Tian.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, stepping out with curiosity toward the youth. “Dog Sheng, what ails you?”

The visitor was familiar—Dog Sheng, now known as Shi Da Niu. Yet Luo Tian still called him Dog Sheng.

“Luo Brother, trouble! Da Li and another clashed!” Shi Da Niu, upon seeing Luo Tian emerge, bore a joyous expression as if finding his anchor. “What’s wrong?”

“Don’t panic—speak slowly.” Luo Tian’s spiritual awareness swept outward, encompassing the entire Nanling territory.

“Boom…” Collisions echoed within Nanling’s domain, two towering figures clashing repeatedly in his spiritual vision.

“Days ago, outsiders continually provoked us. We heeded Chu Brother’s words and did not retaliate.”

“But they grew bolder, shouting insults beyond our gates. Chu Brother is currently undergoing the Barbarian God Guard’s trial. The Elder Chief’s health is poor. I could think of no one but you, Luo Brother. Please advise us!” Shi Da Niu’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears.

“Stay calm—let me see.” Luo Tian sighed, sensing Shi Da Li was struggling. His opponent, also at Sage Peak, wielded superior techniques.

“Hah! You dare insult me? Calling you a fool is an honor! You’re worse than a fool!” The barbarian youth, locked in combat with Shi Da Li, sneered. Each clash sent Shi Da Li retreating, blood spilling from his lips.

“Ah…” Shi Da Li’s fury reached its peak. Both were of equal rank, yet his opponent seemed to overpower him with sheer strength.

“Da Li, stay calm! Do as I instruct!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed within Shi Da Li’s mind.

“Don’t rely solely on brute force—strike with seven parts of your strength!” Luo Tian stood within Nanling’s domain, transmitting instructions to Shi Da Li. He could not reveal himself but guided him through mental communication.

“Channel your Sage Energy to your feet, strike the Hundred Feet and Upper Hill points…” Luo Tian’s transmissions steadied Shi Da Li’s frenzied mind, prompting him to channel his Sage Energy.

“Boom…” Another clash—Shi Da Li was repelled again, but this time, he did not vomit blood. Instead, he kicked off the ground, leaping into the sky. His thick thighs radiated radiant light, with flowing barbarian patterns adorning them.

“What is he doing?” The onlookers exchanged puzzled glances, sensing Shi Da Li’s transformation.

“Foolish trickery! A village bumpkin—what skills could he possess?” The youth sneered, his fists glowing golden as he lunged at Shi Da Li.

“Buzz…” As the youth’s fist launched, a crushing pressure descended upon the sky.

“I’ll crush you!” Shi Da Li’s eyes burned with exhilaration, feeling unprecedented power. His right leg seemed capable of crushing all.

“What!” The onlookers gaped, stunned by Shi Da Li’s sudden strength.

The sky trembled as a golden foot descended, crushing the youth’s golden fist. The heavens shook; violent waves erupted from their collision, scattering blood mist across the ground.

“What? The boy who was dominated now turned the tables, crushing Meng Zhengyang into mist!”

“What martial art is this? It feels so familiar—like our barbarian’s Seven Stomps!” One murmured.

“It’s stomping a leg!” Shi Da Li beamed, triumphant after humiliating Meng Zhengyang.

“Nonsense! It’s clearly the Seven Stomps!” The blood mist coalesced, and Meng Zhengyang’s form gradually reformed.

“How did you obtain the Seven Stomps? Speak!” Meng Zhengyang’s face turned icy, his eyes gleaming with smugness despite his pallor.

“Without the Barbarian God Palace’s permission, studying the Seven Stomps is a capital offense!” The crowd murmured, suspecting Shi Da Li had stolen the technique.

Chapter 1676: Killing ()

“Seven Stomps? I’ve never heard of it! This is our clan’s martial art!” Shi Da Li, bewildered, protested. If he had stolen the Seven Stomps, it would be a death sentence.

“Nonsense! Do you think us fools? You clearly used the first stomp of the Seven Stomps. Don’t lie—come, let’s take this scoundrel to the Barbarian God Palace!” A cold-faced youth emerged from the crowd.

“Meng Jiayu!” The onlookers exchanged puzzled glances, staring at the youth.

Meng Jiayu, a member of the Meng Clan in the Wild Expanse, was at the Threshold of Epoch. In the Wild Expanse, he was a minor celebrity. His presence, flanked by Meng Clan members, suggested premeditated intent—seeking any flaw in Nanling’s people to strike.

“Stay quiet!” Meng Jiayu smiled, approaching Shi Da Li with arrogance. He knew Nanling’s strongest was Chu Chen, newly entered the Early Epoch. Others were mere scraps.

“Shi Da Li, a bumpkin’s name!” Meng Jiayu sneered, stepping forward with several Meng Clan members—each at Sage Peak, no weaker than the youth Shi Da Li had crushed.

“Boy, come with us!” Meng Jiayu looked down on Shi Da Li, sneering.

“I won’t go! Why do you arrest people?” Shi Da Li trembled, stepping back.

“Chu Chen Brother is a Barbarian God Guard—your arrest is unlawful!” The Nanling people looked anxious. Meng Jiayu’s group radiated fear.

“Hah… You mean your useless clan leader? He’s barely surviving! Don’t you know the Barbarian God Guard trials can be fatal?” Meng Jiayu’s face was cold.

“You scum! You dare call us ‘scum’? We were exiled from the Wild Expanse for colluding with humans. Now you’ve returned—did you ask our Meng Clan?” Meng Jiayu’s voice was icy, then he advanced on Shi Da Li, his hand shooting out to strike.

The colossal palm, pulsating with power, loomed over Shi Da Li’s head, turning his face pale.

Meng Jiayu was at the Threshold of Epoch; Shi Da Li could not withstand him. Yet he roared, striking Meng Jiayu’s hand with a fist.

“Done…”

“The boy will survive, but like Meng Zhengyang, he’ll regenerate from blood!” The onlookers sighed, murmuring.

“You dare oppose the Meng Clan? A mountain village dares to rise again. We’ve long sought the remnants of the Stone Clan—now you’ve come knocking!” Meng Zhengyang, pale but triumphant, felt resentment at his defeat.

“Boom…” Yet the next moment, blood mist rose. All sighed deeply.

“Da Li!” The Nanling people roared, watching the blood mist, their eyes reddening.

But soon, all gasped in disbelief—Stood there, frozen in his punch stance, was Shi Da Li.

“What’s happening…” All were stunned. The boy who should’ve been mist now stood unharmed, blood splattered on the ground, gray vapor swirling upward.

“Meng Jiayu! How could he be reduced to mist by a Sage Peak!” The crowd awoke, murmuring.

“What? When did I become so strong?” Shi Da Li stared at the blood on his fist, murmuring.

“I didn’t do anything!” Shi Da Li looked around, bewildered. He had merely thrown a punch—hadn’t even touched Meng Jiayu.

“Genius! At Sage Peak, he crushed a Threshold of Epoch into mist—such power even the legendary Barbarian Soul Prince couldn’t match!” The crowd erupted, gazing at Shi Da Li with reverence.

The Meng Clan’s accompanying members turned anxious but surrounded Shi Da Li.

“What are you doing? I’m strong! Didn’t you see his fate?” Shi Da Li, surrounded by several Sage Peaks, panicked, raising his fist.

“Boom…” As Shi Da Li raised his fist, the surrounding Meng Clan members mirrored his rhythm, retreating. They remembered how Meng Jiayu had been turned to mist by this seemingly weak punch.

“Why are you still here? Fight!” The humming echoed, and Meng Jiayu’s body coalesced. His face twisted with rage, staring at Shi Da Li.

“Alas…” Luo Tian sighed from the corner, surprised he had turned Meng Jiayu into mist without deterring them.

Luo Tian had no choice but to retrieve his Thousand Mirage Mask, placing it over his face. His body grew rapidly, towering dozens of feet high. He smiled, then stepped forward, vanishing from Shi Da Niu’s sight.

“Luo Brother, wait for me!” Shi Da Niu gaped as Luo Tian’s figure faded.

“Kill…” The towering barbarian giants, radiating Sage Peak energy, surged toward Shi Da Li.

“I’ll fight back!” Shi Da Li roared, fear gnawing at him, yet his recent victory over Meng Jiayu gave him a strange confidence.

“Don’t let Da Li face this alone! Help him!” The Nanling people, furious, shouted. Their unity was evident.

“Do you think you’re worthy of fighting us?” Meng Jiayu sneered, watching the group’s weakest at Sage Late. He moved swiftly toward them. Though he had regenerated from blood, his rank was still Sage Peak—enough to crush the Nanling group.

“Boom…” Yet as Meng Jiayu moved, a golden streak descended from the sky like a meteor, colliding with his body.

Blood mist rose again, splattering the ground. The onlookers gasped, staring at the towering figure standing atop Meng Jiayu’s blood.

“Again mist!” The crowd grimaced, sighing at Meng Jiayu’s misfortune. Once the strongest among them, he had been shattered twice in moments.

“Move aside!” A low voice echoed. A crushing pressure swept over the surrounding Meng Clan members.

Invisible waves emanated from Luo Tian’s mouth, like rolling thunder, shaking their minds. His Epoch Late aura radiated from his transformed barbarian giant.

“Boom… Boom…” Explosions echoed as the several Sage Peaks surrounding Shi Da Li were obliterated, turning into mist and staining the ground red.

“Epoch Late!” The crowd gasped in terror, gazing at Luo Tian with awe.

“How could a small Nanling hold an Epoch Late?” Their faces bore shock, their expressions shifting.

A roar shattered several Sage Peaks—such power left them speechless. Who was this stranger in the barbarian clan?

“Who called us scum?” Luo Tian’s hand grasped, waves surged. A stream of gray spiritual souls emerged from the coalescing blood, floating before him. Their gray eyes brimmed with terror.

“Who… are you?” Meng Jiayu and his men stared in fear, their fates now at the mercy of this Nanling giant.

“Who I am doesn’t matter. What matters is what you intend to do?” Luo Tian’s face was cold, his gaze deepening.

“Soul Extraction!” His voice echoed, and invisible waves surged into Meng Jiayu’s soul. Luo Tian glimpsed his memories.

“Damn!” Observing Meng Jiayu’s soul, Luo Tian’s face turned icy. Killing intent radiated from him. He grasped Meng Jiayu and the other Sage Peaks’ souls, which scattered before the barbarians.

“Dare he kill in the barbarian clan!” The crowd gaped, their expressions turning incredulous.

“Great news!” They surrounded Luo Tian, recalling the old rule: killing was forbidden in the Wild Expanse, decreed by the Barbarian God Palace and Elder Sa Man. No barbarian had dared defy it for years.

“I’ll be back soon—return to your territory and await my news!” Luo Tian spoke as if doing a trivial task, addressing Shi Da Niu and the others.

Chapter 1677: Charging into the Barbarian God Palace ()

“Don’t go! Come with us to the Barbarian God Palace!” Luo Tian had just spoken when two cold-eyed barbarians approached, holding gray ropes.

“Barbarian God Guards!” The crowd’s faces turned respectful. Most were mere onlookers, unaware the situation had escalated so drastically—killing in the Wild Expanse, especially Meng Clan members. This was no small matter.

Yet they admired Luo Tian for daring to kill in the Wild Expanse. For years, no one had dared—though the Barbarian Soul clan could kill there, they hadn’t. This stranger’s audacity was unprecedented.

“Come,” one Barbarian God Guard spoke softly, his gray rope entwined with barbarian patterns. It coiled toward Luo Tian like a dragon.

“Get lost! I’m going to the Barbarian God Palace, but not under your ropes. If you provoke me, I’ll tear down your palace!” Luo Tian grabbed the dragon-like rope, tearing it in two.

“He…” The crowd was stunned. Who dared defy the Barbarian God Guards, even threatening to destroy their palace?

“Dare you defy us?” The two Barbarian God Guards’ faces turned icy. Though they were at Early Epoch, who dared defy them? Only the Barbarian Soul clan.

“I told you to move!” Luo Tian had no patience for their words, pushing off the ground. His massive body soared toward the palace.

“Send a message to the Palace Lord!” One guard pulled out his identity token, while another appeared before Luo Tian. His golden foot descended like the first stomp of the Seven Stomps.

“Don’t blame me for being harsh!” Luo Tian had no time to argue, grabbing the foot with his golden hand.

“Boom…” A deep sound echoed in the Wild Expanse’s sky. The people gaped, staring at the sky.

“Return! This time I won’t kill you. If you block me again, don’t blame me!” Luo Tian swung his golden hand, hurling the guard to the ground.

“Boom…” The explosion echoed through the Wild Expanse. The guard’s massive body crashed into the ground, creating a crater and spitting blood. His eyes were wide with disbelief.

“Larva!” The guard felt himself a mere insect before Luo Tian, an experience he’d never had against Epoch Late.

Luo Tian ignored the wounded guard, transforming into a streak of light toward the Barbarian God Palace. His mind was urgent—Meng Jiayu’s soul extraction revealed their plan: to sabotage Chu Chen during his trial, secretly killing him.

“Since you couldn’t wait a month, I’ll grant your wish!” Luo Tian’s killing intent surged. He reached the palace’s entrance.

“Who are you?” The Barbarian God Palace Lord, Ban Cheng, appeared in the sky. His gaze was authoritative.

“Where is Chu Chen’s trial?” Luo Tian didn’t answer Ban Cheng but demanded.

“You first answer my question!” Ban Cheng, at Epoch Peak, felt a profound threat from Luo Tian. He felt inferior to this Epoch Late.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian exhaled, unwilling to waste time. “Your trial has been tampered with—someone plans to kill Chu Chen!”

“Who I am doesn’t matter. If Chu Chen dies, you’ll all die with him—your negligence!” Luo Tian continued without giving Ban Cheng a chance to speak.

“What!” Ban Cheng was stunned, unsure if Luo Tian’s words were true. But Chu Chen’s life was tied to the King’s child, a person the Barbarian Soul and Sa Man had specifically requested. He couldn’t ignore it.

“Wait here—I’ll check!” Ban Cheng spoke, then vanished into the palace.

But as soon as he moved, Luo Tian appeared beside him: “Sorry, I don’t trust you!”

“You…” Ban Cheng’s face turned icy. This unknown barbarian dared to enter the palace—unacceptable.

“Barbarian God’s heir, I’ll save him. Take me in!” Luo Tian spoke before Ban Cheng could react.

“Lord, let him in. I’ll accompany you!” As Ban Cheng hesitated, the Barbarian Soul appeared from the sky.

“Good,” Ban Cheng nodded. With the Barbarian Soul’s word, he had no choice but to let him in. After all, the Barbarian Soul was a near-king—his actions were limited.

The three entered the vast Barbarian God Palace, followed by several other barbarians, arriving too late.

“Go to the trial site!” Ban Cheng’s face was grim, leading them deeper into the hall. Soon, they reached a side chamber.

“This is Chu Chen’s trial site!” Ban Cheng addressed Luo Tian and the Barbarian Soul, then waved his hands. A stream of barbarian patterns flowed from him, etching the door.

“Creak…” The massive door slowly opened. A deafening explosion echoed from within, swirling winds sweeping over them.

“Go!” Ban Cheng’s face changed, stepping in with the group. Waves pressed upon their bodies.

In an instant, they entered a small world. The scene within was revealed to them.

“Ah…” Roars echoed, battle waves spreading across the stars. Luo Tian and the others immediately focused on the fight.

“Boom…” Before they could react, another explosion echoed in their ears.

“Damn!” Luo Tian saw the battle scene, his eyes turning crimson. He dashed toward the fight.

Blood mist filled the air. Two towering barbarian giants stood coldly, one saying: “Blame your family for not being worthy.”

“Meng Hu, keep your promise—don’t forget to fulfill it!” A scarred barbarian giant addressed another in purple robes, then stepped toward the blood mist.

“Rest assured, I’ll take over!” Meng Hu smiled, gazing at the blood mist.

“But this boy has skill. If I were alone, I might not have beaten him. He mastered the Fifth Stomp of the Seven Stomps—where did he learn it?” Meng Hu’s face showed interest.

“Keep the soul! Search to find the Seven Stomps!” Meng Hu told the scarred giant.

“Hmph,” the scarred giant nodded, clearly interested in the latter stomp of the Seven Stomps.

The Meng Clan planned to kill Chu Chen secretly, sending Meng Hu as their agent—his rank was Epoch Mid.

“Buzz…” Waves emanated from the scarred giant’s hands, his hand reaching into the blood mist.

“Die!” But before Chu Chen’s gray soul was captured, a cold voice echoed across the stars. The scarred giant’s face turned pale instantly.

“Who!” The scarred giant was startled, but it was his last word. Luo Tian’s body had already arrived, giving him no chance to resist. His powerful physique collided with the scarred giant’s body.

“Crack…” The sound of breaking echoed. How could a Mid-Epoch withstand Luo Tian’s relentless assault? Before the word ended, the scarred giant was shattered.

“Die!” Luo Tian’s crimson eyes glowed. His soul-annihilation technique, unique to the Soul Annihilator, was unleashed on the scarred giant’s soul, erasing it completely.

“Fast!” The Barbarian Soul and Ban Cheng appeared in the stars, their faces shocked. From Luo Tian’s attack to eliminating the scarred giant, it took less than a breath—far beyond ordinary Epoch Late capabilities. Even Ban Cheng, at Epoch Peak, would find it difficult.

Only the Barbarian Soul saw Luo Tian’s attack clearly. Upon seeing his soul annihilated, the Barbarian Soul’s eyes flickered.

“You…” Meng Hu stood stunned, unable to believe that the scarred giant—his ally in fighting Chu Chen—was now destroyed by this youth. His speed exceeded his imagination.

Chapter 1678: Taking You to Revenge ()

“You… who are you?” Meng Hu was stunned, then saw the Barbarian Soul and Ban Cheng. His face turned pale.

“Meng Hu, why are you here?” Ban Cheng’s cold gaze met Meng Hu’s. He had assigned one to guard Chu Chen—this was the scarred giant, now dead. The truth was clear.

Moreover, everyone saw the blood mist coalescing, Chu Chen’s pale face—understanding Meng Hu’s presence meant what.

“Lord… I…” Meng Hu trembled, trying to beg for mercy. But before he could finish, a pair of crimson eyes appeared before him. A golden fist, radiating wild power, struck his head.

“Boom…” His skull burst, and Meng Hu was killed in an instant. Another breath had not passed before Luo Tian eliminated him before the crowd’s eyes.

“You…” The crowd’s faces darkened, even the Barbarian Soul. They felt Luo Tian had gone too far—his arrogance was unbearable. A mere Epoch Late, he had first killed the Barbarian God Guards, then Meng Hu—disrespecting them all.

“Who are you? Though they’re guilty, it’s not your place to interfere with our Barbarian God Palace!” Ban Cheng coldly spoke, his aura radiating.

“Guilty? I don’t believe it! My brother’s revenge is mine to take. If I had arrived later, my brother would be dead. None of your lives are worth his!” Luo Tian coldly replied, unafraid even before the barbarian crowd.

If Chu Chen were safe, it would be fine. But this time, he had nearly died in the Barbarian God Palace—Luo Tian was enraged. He held no regard for Ban Cheng, who had failed to control his subordinates.

Who was Luo Tian? He saw clearly: the scarred giant must have been assigned to guard Chu Chen. Clearly, the Meng Clan had bribed him to kill Chu Chen in this world.

“I’ll not only kill them but Meng Yunlong as well!” Luo Tian’s gaze met Ban Cheng and the Barbarian Soul. His face was cold.

“Of course, you may stop me—kill me if you wish. But only I can awaken the King’s child!” He approached Chu Chen, handing him a pill. His gaze locked on Ban Cheng and the Barbarian Soul.

“Are you threatening us?” Ban Cheng’s voice turned icy, his aura pressing toward Luo Tian.

For years, no one had dared act so arrogantly in the barbarian clan—especially a mere Epoch Late. Even other royal clans had not done so.

“Curious, who gave you the courage to speak thus? Do you think your threat is effective? If caught, I have a thousand methods to make you talk!” Ban Cheng’s voice was cold.

“Hah, save your tricks. They’re useless against me. If you wanted to kill me, you wouldn’t have waited this long!” Luo Tian smiled coldly, standing still as Ban Cheng’s aura pressed upon him. His robes fluttered in the wind.

“Then today I’ll see what qualifications you have to be arrogant in my clan!” Ban Cheng, seeing Luo Tian’s coldness, sneered. His massive hand, covered in barbarian patterns, descended upon Luo Tian.

Cold air swept the starry sky of the small world. A sinister killing intent accompanied his blood-red hand, striking Luo Tian. This attack combined Ban Cheng’s power and years of killing experience. Most would lose their minds under such pressure.

“Epoch Peak? That’s all?” Luo Tian sneered, despite his current cultivation being only back to Epoch Late. He was not one to be insulted by an Epoch Peak.

As he spoke, Luo Tian’s aura surged skyward, a boundless killing intent radiating from him.

“Comparing who kills more? You’re not worthy!” Luo Tian’s face was cold, his hands moving. He struck a punch.

“Boom…” The punch shattered the stars, turning them blood-red. All shivered.

“Killing!” Luo Tian had spent years doing this—countless lives ended by his hands. In terms of killing intent, few in the Nine Realms could match him.

“Ugh…” A wailing sound echoed, as if countless souls mourned in the stars. They swept toward Ban Cheng.

“What…” Ban Cheng’s face turned pale, his body cold as if in a sea of corpses. Cold sweat dripped from him.

“Boom…” Ban Cheng’s momentary distraction allowed Luo Tian’s golden fist to clash with his hand.

The explosion echoed through the stars, Ban Cheng’s blood-red hand disintegrating into waves.

“Buzz…” Luo Tian stepped on the stars, bending slightly before becoming a streak of light. He appeared before Ban Cheng, striking him with another punch.

“Damn!” Ban Cheng’s eyes regained clarity but saw the golden fist striking him.

Like a thunderous sound, Luo Tian’s punch struck Ban Cheng, sending him back several steps.

“How is this possible!” The crowd gasped. An Epoch Late had repelled an Epoch Peak—beyond their comprehension. Even the Barbarian Soul’s face changed, his gaze different.

“Who is this man? When did the barbarian clan produce such a strength? Why does he feel familiar!” The Barbarian Soul’s eyes flashed with intensity.

As the crowd marveled, Luo Tian’s attacks came like a storm—golden fist images surrounded Ban Cheng. Meanwhile, Ban Cheng’s massive body kept retreating, his heart filled with resentment. He had only been distracted for a moment but was now at Luo Tian’s mercy.
