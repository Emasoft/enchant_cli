A disciple trembled with fear, his face pale as he gazed upon the grey dragon. He whispered, "Master Yang's destructive attribute is truly rare in this world. When his power manifests, I feel my inner energy being suppressed, as if trembling!"

"Of course it is! Master Yang's constitution must be the greatest in the world!" The disciple from Thick Earth Peak gazed at Yang Huan Yu with fervent admiration.

"Is it truly the greatest constitution? What about Luotian's?" A disciple from Greenwood Peak asked, his face filled with doubt.

"Hmph! Master Yang's strength is beyond your comprehension!" The disciple from Thick Earth Peak sneered, his expression filled with contempt. Even when mentioning Yang Huan Yu, his gaze toward Luotian was laced with disdain.

Luotian was currently refining the spiritual energy from the Purifying Spirit Pool, but a sudden wave of pressure interrupted him.

He opened his eyes and saw the grey dragon before Yang Huan Yu, as well as Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu etching bone structures.

But Luotian's attention was drawn to the grey dragon before Yang Huan Yu, his face darkening. He could clearly sense the pressure and danger it exerted upon his five elements.

Since first seeing Yang Huan Yu, Luotian had felt a strange familiarity, yet he could not recall Yang Huan Yu's face or remember seeing him fight. He only knew Yang Huan Yu was formidable, especially now that he was about to enter the Bone-Transformation Stage. This sense of danger grew stronger.

"Never mind, let's focus on advancing to the Bone-Transformation Stage first," Luotian sighed internally. "Without strength, words are meaningless!" He closed his eyes again to continue refining.

At that moment, Feng Qianyu's body had transformed the spiritual energy knife into flowing spiritual energy. It slowly seeped into his hands and chest, merging with the bone slots he had carved earlier.

Feng Qianyu's face was filled with excitement as he roared to the sky, his wild spiritual energy gathering around him. A unique aura of the Bone-Transformation Stage emerged from his body.

"Success!" Several disciples exclaimed, their faces alight with excitement.

"Not yet! The spiritual energy hasn't been fully absorbed!" One disciple interjected.

"Buzz..." As the disciples were still in awe, Zhang Hongyun's feet glowed with golden light while his hands radiated green vitality.

"Master Zhang has also advanced!" A disciple from Golden Light Peak exclaimed, his face alight with excitement as he gazed at Zhang Hongyun.

Before the disciples could recover from the two's ascension, Yang Huan Yu surpassed them, his aura of destruction spreading.

"Master Yang inscribed the bone structure on his skull! That's incredible!" Their faces bore shock.

It was well known that the skull is one of the most complex bones in the human body, housing the brain and consciousness. Yang Huan Yu's ability to carve spiritual energy into such a complex structure demonstrated his extraordinary talent.

"Boom..." Three powerful auras formed within the cave.

At that moment, Feng Qianyu, who was absorbing spiritual energy, sensed that the two had also reached this stage. His face bore a flicker of battle intent.

Zhang Hongyun opened his eyes, gazing at Feng Qianyu and Yang Huan Yu with a surge of battle intent.

Feeling their fiery gazes, Luotian opened his eyes with a faint smile. He understood their meaning.

"Let's fight! I've already lost to Luotian, but I won't lose to anyone in the Bone-Transformation Stage!" Feng Qianyu roared, spreading his arms. A red and blue energy swirled between them, generating a powerful suction that drew spiritual energy from the mountain's sky into his hands.

"Hmph! The genius of the Bone-Transformation Stage must bear my name, Zhang Hongyun!" Zhang Hongyun also activated his martial art, beginning to compete for the spiritual energy in the mountain's sky.

"Bone-Transformation Stage? You are destined to be supporting roles!" Yang Huan Yu's face bore confidence as he glanced at Luotian, his body enveloped in grey spiritual energy.

"They are vying for the spiritual energy above the mountain!" Several disciples exclaimed in unison.

"This must be their first battle upon entering the Bone-Transformation Stage. The victor advances to the Bone-Transformation Stage, while the loser must start over!" One disciple said with admiration.

"This is perhaps the pride of genius—none willing to yield or admit defeat, unwilling to be overshadowed by peers. Even with brief setbacks, they do not falter. These three are clearly such individuals! I cannot match their level of genius," the disciple from Greenwood Peak mused.

"Genius must possess such an unyielding belief in their superiority within the same rank," at that moment, the three had reached an elevated status in the disciples' eyes.

"Such a generation of disciples is quite remarkable," the elder master from Flame Peak mused.

At that moment, those outside the Purifying Spirit Pool felt a noticeable decrease in spiritual energy, their faces turning pale.

"Someone has broken through to the Bone-Transformation Stage! Who is it inside?" The three peak masters' faces bore a trace of concern, each hoping their disciples would enter the Bone-Transformation Stage.

"It's not one person entering the Bone-Transformation Stage, but three auras vying for this mountain!" Zhang Ziping's face bore anticipation. In his mind, Luotian would definitely be one of those who entered the Bone-Transformation Stage.

The three within the cave had now reached a fever pitch, spiritual energy from the air continuously gathering toward them. However, Yang Huan Yu clearly dominated, his body being flooded by a thick spiritual energy vortex. Feng Qianyu and Zhang Hongyun's vortices were substantial but far inferior to Yang Huan Yu's.

Their faces had never looked worse, though they had greatly respected Yang Huan Yu. Yet they hadn't expected such a gap between them.

Chapter 262: Absorption Complete

A smile graced Yang Huan Yu's face as he gazed down upon the two, his presence akin to a sovereign. The disciples' eyes now held reverence for Yang Huan Yu, as he had clearly prevailed in the contest. Thus, Yang Huan Yu entered the Bone-Transformation Stage while the other two might regress to the ninth stage of Body Transcendence or even suffer backlash.

"Insufficient spiritual energy!" Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu gazed at the towering Yang Huan Yu with resentment in their hearts.

"Bone-Transformation Stage, I arrive!" Yang Huan Yu roared, his voice imbued with a destructive aura. His grey spiritual energy surged into his body, merging with his greatly expanded dan tian.

"Master Yang has won! He has entered the Bone-Transformation Stage!" The disciples' faces were alight with excitement. Witnessing three geniuses vying for one Bone-Transformation Stage slot was an experience they felt was worth the journey.

"Then, Feng Qianyu and Zhang Hongyun!" The disciples saw the two still struggling and felt sympathy.

At that moment, the spiritual energy vortices above their heads had grown thin, clearly on the verge of depletion.

"Alas... these two are promising talents. Let's assist them a little," the elder master from Flame Peak sighed, his voice laced with sorrow. The other elders nodded in agreement.

With a wave of their hands, the spiritual energy from other peaks seemed to be driven toward this unassuming mountain. The spiritual energy here surged again, surpassing even its former abundance.

Feng Qianyu and Zhang Hongyun clearly felt the change in spiritual energy, their faces lighting up with joy. Though they had lost to Yang Huan Yu, it did not mean they would not enter the Bone-Transformation Stage. After all, they had reached the peak of Body Transcendence and had no more room for growth.

Feeling the denser spiritual energy, they wasted no time— their previously depleted vortices grew thick again.

A thunderous sound echoed within the cave, and both Feng Qianyu and Zhang Hongyun roared in unison.

This roar carried a fierce sense of resentment—resentment for losing to Luotian in Body Transcendence and for losing again to Yang Huan Yu.

"Success!" The disciples' faces bore excitement, astonished that they had witnessed three geniuses enter the Bone-Transformation Stage within an hour. This was a rare occurrence in centuries.

"Did it succeed?" The disciples outside the cave bore confusion, guessing who had entered the Bone-Transformation Stage. Clearly, it wasn't just one person.

"It must be Master Luotian! He's always strong, and entering the Bone-Transformation Stage should be no problem!" A disciple from the Dan Hall said with admiration, as Luotian's reputation had reached its peak within the Dan Hall.

"Feng Qianyu and Zhang Hongyun should have entered as well. They were already at the peak of Body Transcendence, and after this long time, they should have succeeded!" The people outside discussed who had entered the Bone-Transformation Stage. Among them, Luotian was the most anticipated figure in the Five Elements Sect.

Within the cave, after entering the Bone-Transformation Stage, the three did not leave but waited for one person—a young man who had crushed them in Body Transcendence. At that moment, this youth was seated within the Purifying Spirit Pool, his eyes closed, with terrifying fluctuations emanating from his body.

Luotian felt great, as his dan tian had been filled with spiritual energy from the Purifying Spirit Pool. The pool was now nearly dry.

The disciples saw the almost-dry pool and wore disappointed expressions, their desire to scavenge vanishing instantly.

The last drop of spiritual energy liquid fell into Luotian's dan tian, leaving no space for more. At that moment, the Purifying Spirit Pool was completely dry.

Luotian suddenly opened his eyes and saw three pairs of burning gazes upon him. He smiled faintly, "Congratulations on your entry into the Bone-Transformation Stage!"

"Enough of the nonsense. Let's see how spectacular it is when a Five Elements Body ascends to the Bone-Transformation Stage!" Zhang Hongyun impatiently said.

Luotian's eyes swept over the three, noting their battle intent. His heart surged with courage as his body emitted a series of thunderous sounds.

Five-colored spiritual energy radiated from his body, forming a five-color dragon that coiled and circled around him.

Luotian gazed at the five spiritual energy dragons with admiration, knowing that if he opened his mouth and inhaled them, he would enter the Bone-Transformation Stage. Upon entering it, his strength would soar again, enabling him to accomplish much. Otherwise, remaining in Body Transcendence meant the Dan Hall elders would never allow him to leave the Five Elements Sect under current conditions in the Northern Region.

The disciples also watched with anticipation, eager to witness how a Five Elements Body would ascend to the Bone-Transformation Stage.

Without hesitation, Luotian opened his mouth and inhaled the five dragons, which flowed into his body. Though he had endured countless pains before, this Bone-Transformation pain was the most excruciating—especially when five elements scraped his bones. Cold sweat drenched him.

Yet, as the five dragons dispersed into his body, a dragon's roar echoed from his back. A powerful pressure surged into his body.

"Roar..." Luotian's eyes widened in shock, sensing the warm energy on his back. A blood dragon composed of runes roared into his body.

The red dragon entered Luotian's body and charged toward the five spiritual energy dragons, which scattered like mice encountering a cat.

However, the red rune dragon surged forward as a torrent, forcing the spiritual energy dragons into a corner and tearing them apart like they were food.

Before long, in Luotian's shocked expression, the spiritual energy dragons were annihilated. The red rune dragon roared once more before returning to Luotian's back.

Including Yang Huan Yu and Zhang Hongyun, all were stunned by Luotian's display. At the moment the red rune appeared, they only heard a series of dragon roars before it ended. The process lasted less than one breath.

Luotian's face was grim, squeezing out a few words through his teeth: "Nirvana Dragon Seal!"

Chapter 263: The Eternal Body Transcendence Stage

Luotian's face darkened as he watched his spiritual energy dragons being shattered. His heart seethed with anger—this destruction meant his attempt to enter the Bone-Transformation Stage had failed.

A powerful sealing force surged again, making Luotian feel his Body Transcendence ninth stage unstable.

"Let me not enter the Bone-Transformation Stage, even if it means I can't advance to Body Transcendence ninth stage!" Luotian roared, his Five Elements Transformation Art surging as he fought against the sealing force from the Nirvana Dragon Seal on his back.

"Failed?" Zhang Hongyun saw no movement within Luotian's body and wore a puzzled expression.

"He failed!" Feng Qianyu and others also looked confused, unable to fathom that Luotian—unbeatable in Body Transcendence—had failed to enter the Bone-Transformation Stage. Seeing the five spiritual energy dragons' power, they had expected Luotian to be among the strongest in the Bone-Transformation Stage. Yet, within less than one breath, his ascension had failed.

Even more unexpected was that Luotian's failure caused his Body Transcendence ninth stage to become unstable, with a slight decline.

Yang Huan Yu's face bore a trace of surprise before he smiled gently, whispering to the disciple from Thick Earth Peak: "Let's go!"

Seeing Yang Huan Yu prepare to leave, Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu understood that Luotian's failure meant he no longer posed a threat.

However, Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu wore expressions of concern. Luotian was their admiration—unquestionably. Seeing his current state, they felt a deep worry, purely from the mutual respect between friends and geniuses.

"He's sealed by a powerful force. If it isn't broken, he may remain in Body Transcendence for life!" Yang Huan Yu's cold voice reached Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu.

Hearing Yang Huan Yu's words, Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu, along with the other disciples, wore expressions of shock. None knew what kind of sealing force was on Luotian's body!

Yet, their gazes toward Luotian bore pity. A genius with five elements, renowned even in the Southern Region, might be doomed to remain in Body Transcendence. This was a devastating blow for Luotian.

"What sealing force is this? Who placed it on this boy? Why didn't we sense it before?" The elder peak masters also bore a trace of anger.

To them, Luotian was the future pillar of the Five Elements Sect. Now, he had been sealed in Body Transcendence ninth stage, unable to enter the Bone-Transformation Stage. These elders could not help but be furious.

"Damn it! If I find out who, I'll settle accounts with them!" The elder master from Flame Peak's face bore a sinister expression.

"The priority is to find a way to break this seal!"

"What's the point? The sealing force's aura—you've felt it, right? Even we have no way to break it!" The elder master from Golden Light Peak wore a bitter expression.

At that moment, Luotian was unaware of the various emotions of those who had witnessed his breakthrough. His heart was bitter, having never expected this Nirvana Dragon Seal to be so霸道 (domineering), suppressing his ascension.

"Let's first stabilize in Body Transcendence ninth stage!" Luotian's eyes bore resentment, his heart roaring. His dan tian's spiritual energy surged fiercely to resist the sealing force.

Fortunately, Luotian had previously resisted this sealing force's aura and now handled it with ease. He wasn't in a panic.

Yang Huan Yu watched Luotian and shook his head gently. Due to his position, he could clearly sense the Nirvana Dragon Seal's power. He felt even a Reincarnation Stage elder would be helpless against it.

Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu's faces were complex as they gazed at Luotian, their eyes filled with sorrow. They did not want to see such a future genius stop here. Their feet hesitated, hoping Luotian would create another miracle for them.

But they were disappointed. At that moment, Luotian opened his eyes, his gaze filled with bitterness. Though his aura was formidable, it did not belong to the Bone-Transformation Stage.

Opening his eyes, Luotian saw their gazes and smiled faintly without further explanation. They must have understood his situation.

"Luotian! Keep going!" Zhang Hongyun stepped forward, patting Luotian's shoulder gently before heading toward the cave entrance.

"I believe in you. You can create another miracle!" Feng Qianyu also approached Luotian, his eyes filled with comfort as he spoke before following Zhang Hongyun out of the cave.

Yang Huan Yu watched Luotian and shook his head gently, leading the disciple from Thick Earth Peak out of the cave.

Luotian watched as they gradually left the cave, his face bearing a bitter expression and a sense of loneliness. Though he said nothing, his heart was deeply saddened by his failure to enter the Bone-Transformation Stage.

At that moment, Zhang Ziping and the other two peak masters waiting at the cave entrance also bore anticipation, eager to see their disciples' strength upon entering the Bone-Transformation Stage.

Other onlookers watched with anticipation, their eyes scanning the cave entrance, guessing who had entered the Bone-Transformation Stage.

"Out!" Someone whispered, directing their attention to the cave's entrance.

"It's Zhang Hongyun! He has entered the Bone-Transformation Stage!" A disciple from Golden Light Peak exclaimed, his face alight with excitement as he watched Zhang Hongyun slowly exit the cave.

" Feng Qianyu has also exited! He too has entered the Bone-Transformation Stage!" Disciples from Water Moon Peak and Flame Peak erupted in cheers.

"Yang Huan Yu has also entered the Bone-Transformation Stage!" A disciple from Thick Earth Peak exclaimed, his face filled with fervor as he watched Yang Huan Yu exit the cave.

The three, radiating powerful auras, appeared before the people's eyes. A few figures bore a bitter smile, watching the three like blazing suns. They knew standing beside them meant becoming mere support.

"Where is Luotian? Has he not completed his ascension yet?" A disciple from the Dan Hall whispered.

Hearing Luotian's name, everyone's gaze shifted from the three to the entrance, their eyes filled with anticipation, eager to see what power Luotian would unleash upon entering the Bone-Transformation Stage.

Chapter 264: Cold Mockery

Hearing people calling Luotian's name, those who had returned to their peaks wore strange expressions.

Zhang Ziping initially bore anticipation as he watched the cave entrance, but with Zhang Hongyun and others exiting and entering the Bone-Transformation Stage, a bad feeling arose in his heart.

As an Elder of the Reincarnation Stage, he naturally felt three auras becoming Bone-Transformation Stage. Now that they had exited the cave and were all in the Bone-Transformation Stage, it was likely Luotian had failed to ascend.

Yet Zhang Ziping could not fathom why, despite Luotian being the strongest in Body Transcendence, others had entered while he failed.

It was not just one person who felt Luotian's failure; Huang Jingshan from Thick Earth Peak also sensed something unusual about Luotian, his face curling into a mocking smile as he gazed at Zhang Ziping.

Under the people's expectant gazes, a somewhat desolate figure emerged from the cave entrance.

"Luotian!" The people shouted, erupting in a thunderous cheer.

But as Luotian appeared before them, the cheer abruptly ceased, their faces filled with disbelief.

Luotian walked out with a bitter smile, hearing the sudden thunderous cheer that stopped abruptly. His heart felt uneasy.

"Body Transcendence ninth stage!"

"Luotian, he... hasn't ascended!" The watching disciples exclaimed in shock, their faces filled with disbelief.

In their minds, since Zhang Hongyun and others had ascended, it was certain that the strongest in Body Transcendence—Luotian—would have ascended to Bone-Transformation Stage.

But what they could not believe was that Luotian had only ascended to Body Transcendence ninth stage, leaving them puzzled.

Zhang Ziping saw Luotian's bitter expression approaching him and his face bore a fleeting surprise before turning indifferent: "Why haven't you ascended yet?"

"Haha! Ascend? Perhaps he'll remain in Body Transcendence ninth stage for the rest of his life!" Huang Jingshan, having just heard Yang Huan Yu recount what happened inside the cave, laughed heartily and mocked.

At the same time, disciples from other peaks who had exited the Purifying Spirit Pool also recounted Luotian's sealing issue, causing people to look at him with pity and sorrow for a prodigy's tragedy.

Of course, some took pleasure in it. Though Luotian was popular and renowned, there were inevitably those who envied him. Others who had been defeated by Luotian before—like Ma Yigao and the disciples from Thick Earth Peak—were delighted to hear Luotian might remain in Body Transcendence ninth stage forever, mocking him loudly.

"What's going on?" Zhang Ziping also heard the murmurs and his face bore a trace of concern as he gazed at Luotian.

Luotian briefly shook his head and recounted the story of the Nirvana Dragon Seal.

Zhang Ziping's heart trembled upon hearing Luotian's account, never expecting a connection between Luotian and the master of Dahan Forest. At the same time, he felt a wave of helplessness.

"Let's go back. We'll have to disturb the old masters of the Dan Hall and see if there's a way!" Zhang Ziping patted Luotian's shoulder gently.

"Luotian, it's okay! There must be a way!"

"Yes, there must be a way!" Several disciples from the Dan Hall comforted Luotian.

"Hmph! There's a way? Even Reincarnation Stage elders couldn't break it. Do you think if it could be broken, those old masters wouldn't help Luotian? Naive!" Huang Jingshan's mood was unusually good, mocking loudly.

Other disciples who had conflicts with Luotian also felt delighted and let out low laughter, but none were as bold as Huang Jingshan.

"Get lost..." Zhang Ziping vanished from his spot, appearing before Huang Jingshan in an instant. His hand swung fiercely, sending the unsuspecting Huang Jingshan flying.

"Boom..." Huang Jingshan's body fell to the ground.

Other disciples from various peaks wore expressions of fear, watching Zhang Ziping's unstable aura and closing their mouths.

Huang Jingshan hadn't expected Zhang Ziping to actually strike him, and his face bore shock: "You... dare to hit me?"

The surrounding disciples wore expressions of looking at a fool, thinking that after the strike, his words were meaningless. At the same time, they bore admiration for Zhang Ziping.

In terms of status, both were peak masters, equal in rank. Yet Zhang Ziping was much younger. People had never expected that Huang Jingshan, a peak master himself, would be struck by Zhang Ziping and even face a public humiliation.

"What? Don't like it? I've been tolerating you for too long. Since you're a peak master, I gave you some face. But now you've overstepped!" Zhang Ziping's cold gaze met Huang Jingshan, his voice sharp.

"Unhappy? You can go report it wherever you want. I'll accept it!" He glared at those who had mocked Luotian before.

Seeing Zhang Ziping's gaze, they trembled. The pressure of a Reincarnation Stage elder was beyond their capacity to withstand, causing them to break out in cold sweat and lower their heads.

"Let's go!" Zhang Ziping turned back, his face returning to a calm expression as he gazed at Luotian.

Luotian's heart warmed, knowing Zhang Ziping had stood up for him. His previous brilliance was too glaring; if the news of his failure spread, others might take advantage to trouble him.

Under the watchful eyes of some trembling people, Zhang Ziping led Luotian out of the crowd.

Huang Jingshan's face was dark as he watched Zhang Ziping strike him, a young disciple publicly humiliating him. This was an unbearable disgrace for him, his eyes flashing with hatred: "Zhang Ziping, one day I'll make you kneel before me and beg like a dog!"

"Have the news of Luotian's failure spread beyond the Five Elements Sect, even to other sects!" Huang Jingshan's face bore a sinister expression as he ordered the disciples from Thick Earth Peak.

Zhang Hongyun and Feng Qianyu, still lingering, sighed as they returned to their peaks. They knew that in the coming days, Luotian would face endless troubles.

Chapter 265: The Era of Genius

With the Purifying Spirit Pool's activation complete, the Five Elements Sect returned to its previous atmosphere. The news of Luotian's failure to enter the Bone-Transformation Stage spread rapidly, soon becoming common knowledge throughout the Five Elements Sect.

Under Huang Jingshan's deliberate promotion, not only did the Five Elements Sect learn of it, but other sects in the Northern Region also became aware.

Although the Northern Region was currently in chaos due to the Tianshi Sect, this news spread like a storm.

For a month, Luotian remained secluded in the Dan Hall, during which Zhang Ziping led him to visit several elders of the Dan Hall. After a month in the back mountains, Luotian emerged with no change in his aura—still Body Transcendence. This left the Dan Hall in a heavy silence.

The disciples of the Dan Hall felt despair, but Luotian's unparalleled mastery of alchemy kept them regarding him as a genius.

At Water Moon Peak, Ji Yunhai had heard of Luotian's failure to enter the Bone-Transformation Stage a month ago. This disappointed him, as he had long intended to challenge Luotian before the Bone-Transformation Stage. He sighed: "You must have misjudged him!"

Pei Letian on Greenwood Peak wore a hint of satisfaction: "Hmph! Now, what qualifications do you have to stand before Gu Qianxue? Only I am worthy of him!"

Meanwhile, the others who had entered the Purifying Spirit Pool also gradually advanced to the Bone-Transformation Stage, causing their peak masters great joy.

Especially for Thick Earth Peak, three disciples advanced to the Bone-Transformation Stage's initial phase. Upon their breakthrough, they boldly declared their intention to challenge Luotian, the former top genius of the Five Elements Sect.

The Dan Hall's disciples were frustrated; if Lei Yongji and Ji Chen had been present, they would have fought the Thick Earth Peak disciples. However, at that time, the Five Elements Sect's young generation in the Bone-Transformation Stage had been dispatched to search for the Tianshi Sect, leaving few able to fight.

Not only did the Five Elements Sect's disciples break through, but other sects' geniuses also gradually advanced. The first to breakthrough was Chen Changsheng of the Water Source Sect, who had reached a terrifying level of resources. His breakthrough to the Bone-Transformation Stage was inevitable.

After Chen Changsheng's breakthrough, Tuyuan Zheng and Pang Haoran of the Water Source Sect also broke through. They loudly proclaimed their intention to challenge Luotian, but Chen Changsheng restrained them.

"Thunder Sect's Ying Hongtu has broken through to the Bone-Transformation Stage!"

"Burning Forge Sect's Rong Da has broken through to the Bone-Transformation Stage!"

"Refining Spirit Sect's Bai Zhantian has broken through to the Bone-Transformation Stage!" Several top sects in the Northern Region had their geniuses break through to the Bone-Transformation Stage. After breaking through, they all declared their intention to fight Luotian.

The sects that had suffered injuries in the Dahan Forest also gradually had their geniuses break through to the Bone-Transformation Stage, vowing to avenge the death of Wang Sichuan.

In the Dahan Forest, some second-rate sects who had previously suffered from Luotian's strength—like Lan Yichen and Leng Yulong—also broke through to the Bone-Transformation Stage. Though they did not loudly declare their intention to challenge Luotian, they still mocked him coldly.

People were more concerned about whether Luotian could enter the Bone-Transformation Stage. Zhang Ziping personally escorted Luotian into the Dahan Forest, but after returning from it, Luotian still bore Body Transcendence's aura. This confirmed the news of his failure to enter the Bone-Transformation Stage.

In the Dan Hall's grand hall...

At that moment, the Dan Hall was silent. Zhang Ziping sat at the center of the hall, while elders frowned as they watched Luotian standing in the middle.

Luotian had now emerged from the shadow of his failure, his face calm. Over two months, he had heard much about the outside world.

Yet Luotian did not care about these people's taunts. Two months had passed without his advancement to the Bone-Transformation Stage, but he was confident that even against a Bone-Transformation Stage beginner, he could fight. If anyone were to act shamelessly, Luotian would not hesitate to teach them a lesson. After all, these people had already seen him as an easy target—this was not what Luotian wanted to see.

At that moment, the people in the hall were not gathered for Luotian's issue but for another important person—Lu Kunpeng. At that moment, Lu Kunpeng sat pale-faced before Zhang Ziping.

Lei Yongji and Ji Chen had returned to the Dan Hall a few days ago, as it was now a time of crisis. If any Bone-Transformation Stage disciples came to challenge them, the Dan Hall had no one to handle it. They believed that although Luotian could fight Bone-Transformation Stage beginners, defeating them was difficult.

"Senior Grandmaster, what's going on?" Zhang Ziping's face darkened as he asked Lu Kunpeng.

"Tienshi Sect! I escorted my friends to Feiyan City and then returned alone. On the way, I coincidentally encountered two Tienshi Sect Bone-Transformation Stage masters who were slaughtering a city. I couldn't ignore it and intervened, but these two used Reincarnation Stage Tienshi to attack me. I couldn't resist and barely escaped being turned into a corpse!" Lu Kunpeng's face was serious as he spoke to the group.

Actually, Lu Kunpeng had returned days ago but immediately fell into a coma due to his injuries. He only regained consciousness today.

"The Tienshi Sect is truly audacious, daring to attack a Grandmaster! It seems we can't let them continue like this. If they keep going, the Northern Region will be ruined!" One elder sighed.

"It's certain. It's time to eradicate the Tienshi Sect. Grandmaster's injury must not be in vain; we must avenge!" The group shouted.

Soon, a decision was made under their shouts, and the Dan Hall began to fully target the Tienshi Sect.

Lu Kunpeng's prestige within the Dan Hall was immense. With his injury, the entire Dan Hall became enraged.

The next day, a Dan Order echoed throughout the Dan Hall. Zhang Ziping's voice rang in all the alchemists' ears: "All alchemists, use your abilities to fight against the Tienshi Sect. Grandmaster was injured and nearly killed by them. Alchemists must not be disgraced! Rise up!"

"Boom..." The Dan Hall's alchemists, upon hearing this voice, exploded like a bomb. They contacted powerful figures they owed favors to—ranging from Body Transcendence to Reincarnation Stage. Major sects' strong figures also moved at the news. The Dan Hall also issued an astonishing bounty.

Chapter 266: Wenti City
