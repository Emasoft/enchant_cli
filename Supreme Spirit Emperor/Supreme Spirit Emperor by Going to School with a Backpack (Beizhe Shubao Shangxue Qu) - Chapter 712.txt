Luo Tian flew back to Heaven Yuan Sect, delivering the news to its disciples. The entire Heaven Yuan Sect exploded into chaos.

"I'll go and destroy Supplement Heaven City right now! Damn it, a mere early-stage Immortal King dares to ride over us? He's given himself too much credit!" Diao Dezhu cursed, and the others also rose to their feet.

"Sit down first!" Luo Tian spoke, halting those about to rush out. His eyes showed confusion; they knew Luo Tian's temperament and understood he was also furious.

"Order the entire Heaven Yuan Sect's True Immortal Strength to mobilize! Anyone who sees Supplement Heaven City's people, kill them!"

"Deploy two million Heaven Yuan Sect disciples to surround Supplement Heaven City!"

"If they want to play, we'll play with them. It's convenient for us to gain time," Luo Tian said softly. Everyone could sense the coldness in his voice.

Once Luo Tian's orders were issued, the entire Heaven Yuan Sect surged with energy. Each disciple of Heaven Yuan Sect rushed out like men possessed, while many more began to gather rapidly.

Over these days, Heaven Yuan Sect had lost tens of thousands. Disciples on cultivation trips were slaughtered half to death; even when strong disciples were sent to rescue, they suffered heavy losses. The disciples knew the perpetrators were from Supplement Heaven City and that the Yama Ten Palaces stood behind them. Originally, they thought this matter would be swept under the rug; Heaven Yuan Sect was strong but couldn't afford to provoke them.

These past two days, the atmosphere in Heaven Yuan Sect had been terrible.

Coming from the Immortal Realm like a stray dog, now having to bow to the Yama Ten Palaces' faces—no one's mood would be good. It was also extremely humiliating; if they had attacked directly, Supplement Heaven City would have been wiped out in one wave. But that would mean openly clashing with the Yama Ten Palaces. How many disciples had died because they hesitated, fearing Supplement Heaven City's name?

"Damn it, finally we can vent our anger! Let those little city lords who dared to touch us suffer!" A loud cry echoed, filled with exhilaration.

"This is the Heaven Yuan Sect!" Luo Tian stood atop a mountain peak, smiling as he watched his disciples and elders mobilize.

Two hours later, two million furious disciples gathered under Nan Gong Yuqing's command and marched toward Supplement Heaven City.

At once, chaos erupted at the boundary between Hell and the Immortal Realm. The Heaven Yuan Sect disciples rushed forth like wild horses, hunting Supplement Heaven City's outer soldiers.

Even smaller cities involved in the conflict were swept up; many were completely annihilated, and Heaven Yuan Sect's reputation soared again.

"Has Heaven Yuan Sect gone mad? How dare they take such bold actions? Do they truly not fear the Yama Ten Palaces?" In Supplement Heaven City, Huang Tianxiang and others nearly collapsed upon hearing the news.

"Lord of the City, we've lost tens of thousands over these two days. The soldiers sent out were almost all killed; only a few escaped this disaster!" A half-Immortal King disciple reported.

"Quickly contact all the palaces; Heaven Yuan Sect is rebelling!" Huang Tianxiang's scalp prickled, and he shouted to the others.

Boom...

As Huang Tianxiang's words were still echoing, a series of thunderous noises erupted in their ears. The earth trembled, and Huang Tianxiang's face changed.

"Lord of the City, the city outside... it's surrounded by Heaven Yuan Sect disciples!" A disciple from Huang Tian Palace rushed into the hall, shouting desperately.

"What?!" Huang Tianxiang's face turned pale in shock; he hadn't expected Heaven Yuan Sect to dare rebel.

"Done... done..." The several palace elders inside the hall were like ants on a hot pan, but the half-Immortal King from the Turning Wheel Palace remained calm. After all, the Turning Wheel Palace had no involvement in this and suffered no losses.

"Lord of the City, Heaven Yuan Sect hasn't attacked but merely surrounded Supplement Heaven City!" Another messenger reported, causing Huang Tianxiang's eyes to gleam with determination. He stepped out of the hall and onto the city wall, gazing at the black clouds of deathly energy from Heaven Yuan Sect's disciples. Especially those standing in front, Huang Tianxiang and the other half-Immortal Kings nearly collapsed.

"Supplement Heaven City Lord, come out for a meeting!" Nan Gong Yuqing shouted at the city. His gaze met Huang Tianxiang atop the wall, his eyes filled with disdain.

"Friends of Heaven Yuan Sect, are we... having some misunderstanding?" Huang Tianxiang forced himself to step forward, standing a hundred zhang away.

"It's indeed some misunderstanding!" Nan Gong Yuqing smiled and waved his hand, a flash of divine light.

Crash...

Like raindrops, millions of crystalline stones piled up at Nan Gong Yuqing's feet, forming a small mountain.

"Lord Huang, my apologies; due to this misunderstanding, Heaven Yuan Sect has killed many of your Supplement Heaven City disciples. According to your price, this is two million Immortal Crystals—please accept them!" Nan Gong Yuqing chuckled and addressed Huang Tianxiang.

"You..." Huang Tianxiang's face darkened, surprised that the enemy had come for this reason.

"Relieving our anger and resentment!" The Heaven Yuan Sect disciples watched Huang Tianxiang's expression, their long-held frustration now eased.

"Of course, in the future, we Heaven Yuan Sect may also compensate you with many more Immortal Crystals and Ghost Crystals!" Nan Gong Yuqing chuckled, drawing his demon sword and holding it to his chest.

Chapter 2684: Re-entering the Immortal Realm ()

"Y... you..." Upon hearing Nan Gong Yuqing's words, Huang Tiancai's face changed drastically; he understood the meaning behind Nan Gong Yuqing's words.

"Nan Gong Elder, I accept these. This matter was indeed a misunderstanding; I hope Heaven Yuan Sect won't hold it against us!" Huang Tiancai forced a laugh, his gaze on Nan Gong Yuqing and the furious disciples behind him.

Huang Tiancai dared not gamble; although he also believed Heaven Yuan Sect wouldn't dare to openly defy the Ten Palaces, if he lost this gamble, it would cost him and all of Supplement Heaven City their lives.

"Haha, Lord Huang, what are you saying? We're just a small sect; how dare we provoke the Ten Palaces' authority? After all, Supplement Heaven City is their face!" Nan Gong Yuqing laughed loudly but didn't withdraw his forces.

"Lord Huang, return to your city; we're just training here. Won't this affect Supplement Heaven City?" Nan Gong Yuqing looked at Huang Tiancai, smiling gently.

"No, no; after all, we're both Hell forces—family!" Huang Tiancai inwardly cursed but spoke politely. He was relieved that they weren't attacking Supplement Heaven City.

"Damn it, who blocks the door? We'd rather die than be insulted! If you dare, kill us!" Huang Tiancai was timid but not everyone else.

Suddenly, two half-Immortal Kings shouted, and Supplement Heaven City's soldiers rushed out, shouting at Nan Gong Yuqing.

"Oh?" Nan Gong Yuqing's eyes flickered with interest, observing the two half-Immortal Kings. He didn't know which palaces they came from; Luo Tian had instructed that the Turning Wheel Palace's people must not be harmed.

"Which palace do these two belong to?" Nan Gong Yuqing asked with interest.

"Nameless and unrepentant, I am from the Wu Hua Palace, Cheng Tianzuo!"

"I am from the Huang Tian Palace, Zhang Tiansi!" The two shouted loudly, their gazes filled with disdain toward Nan Gong Yuqing.

"What a great name! You two should combine your names—Cheng Tianzuo and Zhang Tiansi!" Nan Gong Yuqing chuckled, his demon sword flashing.

Puff... Puff...

The blade's light pierced the sky, instantly cutting through the two. It killed them in one strike and didn't stop there; the ten thousand soldiers from Supplement Heaven City who had rushed out were also instantly beheaded by Nan Gong Yuqing's blade.

Blood mist rose, hundreds of people turned into corpses on the ground, their blood staining the earth.

"Lord Huang, this was still a misunderstanding; my sword is a demon sword—it sometimes doesn't obey me!" Nan Gong Yuqing acted as if nothing had happened, gazing at Huang Tiancai.

Huang Tiancai's face turned red with anger but his heart trembled; he hadn't expected Nan Gong Yuqing to kill two elders from the Huang Tian and Wu Hua Palaces.

"This is ten thousand Immortal Crystals; as per the usual practice, five thousand each!" Nan Gong Yuqing waved his hand again, throwing ten thousand Immortal Crystals before Huang Tiancai.

Others trembled; their gazes were fearful toward Nan Gong Yuqing, even though they had the Yama Ten Palaces behind them. Yet this killer seemed to fear no one, killing without hesitation.

"Alright, it was a misunderstanding; Lord Huang, please return!" Nan Gong Yuqing addressed Huang Tiancai, acting like he was sending a guest off.

"Good, then Lord Nan Gong may proceed!" Huang Tiancai inwardly cursed but smiled politely. He and the others turned back into Supplement Heaven City.

"Set up camp; from today, anyone who dares to leave the city will be killed!" Nan Gong Yuqing ordered his disciples.

"Yes!" The Heaven Yuan Sect soldiers shouted, their voices filled with excitement; each looked at Supplement Heaven City with fierce eyes.

"Damn it, they've been bullied!" Conversely, the soldiers of Supplement Heaven City were also extremely frustrated; their eyes burned with anger. They were Yama Ten Palaces' people, and even the three days of the Immortal Realm had been beaten down by the Ten Palaces. How could a small Heaven Yuan Sect dare to bully them?

...

On another front, Luo Tian and others received the news from Nan Gong Yuqing. Their anger was finally vented.

"I'll go to the Immortal Realm; during this time, whoever dares to touch us, kill them! No need to hold back. At least the frontline hasn't fallen; we're still safe!"

"The Yama Ten Palaces are currently preoccupied with the Luo Sheng Gate; they have no time to care about us!" Luo Tian addressed them.

"We'll go with you too!" Diao Dezhu and others spoke, knowing this trip to the Immortal Realm would be extremely dangerous.

"Don't; you should stay and guard home. The Hell palaces might come at any time!" Luo Tian replied. This journey was dangerous, and Luo Tian also had confidence; he was already in the late-stage Immortal King and even had the means to escape from an early-stage Immortal King.

Luo Tian acted immediately; he needed to reach the frontline quickly because only there could he enter Buzhao Mountain in the upper three realms. Under the vast sky, Luo Tian flew at full speed because he knew time was limited; he needed to check the frontline's situation. If the frontline was filled, Hell would take over the middle three realms, and when they returned to Hell, they'd definitely attack Heaven Yuan Sect. In that case, Luo Tian wouldn't be able to escape.

...

"What? Heaven Yuan Sect surrounded Supplement Heaven City, and anyone who dares to leave the city will be killed!" At the same time, several Yama Palaces in Hell also received news from Supplement Heaven City and were shocked.

"Bold, bold!" Several palace masters roared; Heaven Yuan Sect's actions had truly insulted the Ten Palaces.

"First it was Luo Sheng Gate, now a small Heaven Yuan Sect—do they want to rebel against the heavens?"

"Once we deal with Luo Sheng Gate, we'll crush Heaven Yuan Sect. Also, send word to the Immortal Realm's frontline; speed up the process—within a month, we must seize the frontline!" The palace masters discussed and shouted.

The palace masters' anger shook even Hell, as it was the first time in years they had seen such fury among the Ten Palaces.

In the dark space, the Ten Palace masters appeared, their faces as gloomy as ever.

"What's the situation with Luo Sheng Gate? The head of the Yin Shen Palace was killed!" The palace masters returned their focus to Luo Sheng Gate, as they considered it more challenging than Heaven Yuan Sect.

Heaven Yuan Sect was right there; if they had the chance, they could destroy it. But Luo Sheng Gate was everywhere and had captured their Holy Son and Immortal Lord.

"Half a ghost vein, we each only have one!" The palace masters felt the pain; ghost veins were a form of core strength.

"What else can we do? Should we really lose our Holy Sons and Immortal Lords?"

"I decide to surrender! First, rescue the late-stage Immortal Lord, and maybe we can trace Luo Sheng Gate through the exchange!" Huang Tian Palace Master spoke, his voice filled with reluctance.

"Good, then we'll surrender as well!" The other palace masters spoke, understanding Huang Tian Palace Master's situation; after all, Huang Tian Palace had lost its Holy Son. The silent Bai Hei and Cang Lan exchanged a glance, their lips slightly curled.

Chapter 2685: The Frontline ()

Outside the frontline, a black cloud of forces was stationed. The once-blue sky had turned dark and gloomy; countless black figures stood outside, rapidly striking ghost energy into the vast void rift.

For nearly two years, countless Hell ghosts had been pouring ghost energy into this void rift.

Originally boundless void rifts now only spanned several million miles, and their energy had become much more stable.

"Now, late-stage Immortal Kings can cross through!" Several late-stage Immortal Kings stood there, their eyes filled with excitement.

"I believe it won't take more than two months before the rift is completely filled; then, the entire upper three realms will be ours!"

"Then we'll attack from the Fan Tian Sea or through this frontline into the upper three realms!" The late-stage Immortal Kings chuckled.

"Full-scale attack! The Ten Palace Masters have ordered us to seize this frontline within a month!" A late-stage Immortal King shouted.

As the words fell, soldiers in the camp stepped out, standing outside the void rift and striking ghost energy to fill it.

For these two years, Hell's army had alternated between resting and filling the rift—seven days on rotation. After all, no one could avoid fatigue.

Now that everyone was out, the filling speed naturally increased by half.

Ten thousand zhang away from the camp, Luo Tian stood in the sky. With his full power flying, he had reached here within seven days, even though it was far away. He could see the dark camp from afar.

"A month or so..." Luo Tian muttered, gazing at the swirling ghost energy void rift, his brows furrowed. For Luo Tian, time was tight.

"Still, from here, it would take about a month to reach Heaven Yuan Sect; that means I must return within two months!" Luo Tian calculated the time.

"Go straight through!" Luo Tian's back shimmered with radiant light, and the words "Gui Gu" (Ghost Valley) were unusually prominent. He knew how to hide his presence but couldn't conceal these two words, so he had no choice but to force his way through.

"Whoever blocks me, I'll kill them!" Luo Tian spoke coldly; now they were enemies except for the Turning Wheel Palace's people. Thus, he wouldn't hold back.

The Rending Sky Spear was in Luo Tian's hand; he soared into the sky, becoming a streak of light toward the frontline.

Ten thousand zhang... eight thousand zhang...

Within a moment, Luo Tian reached the Hell army's camp outside. His aura was overwhelming.

"Who!" When Luo Tian was ten thousand zhang away, the Hell forces noticed him and turned their gazes to the sky.

" Heaven Yuan Sect's Luo Tian, I'm here to borrow a path through the frontline!" Luo Tian shouted loudly, gazing at the Hell forces.

"Luo Tian!" Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, several late-stage Immortal Kings were stunned; their gazes were heavy as they looked at Luo Tian in the sky.

Several late-stage Immortal Kings had met Luo Tian during the Ten Palaces' Grand Tournament, but he didn't know their names.

"Luo Tian, you still dare to come here!" A late-stage Immortal King shouted loudly, his gaze filled with excitement.

"Capture him!" Almost simultaneously, the late-stage Immortal Kings except for the Turning Wheel Palace's Jueying Tianzun made their decision.

Heaven Yuan Sect surrounding Supplement Heaven City was naturally known to them, as well as the Ten Palaces' masters ordering them to destroy Heaven Yuan Sect after finishing the frontline.

Luo Tian was the leader of Heaven Yuan Sect; capturing him would be a great achievement, cutting off one arm of Heaven Yuan Sect. From what they knew, Heaven Yuan Sect had only three late-stage Immortal Kings.

"Since you won't let me borrow a path, I'll carve one through blood!" Luo Tian's eyes turned cold; the Rending Sky Spear hummed. He stepped into the void, rushing toward the frontline.

Late-stage Immortal Kings; Luo Tian's speed was already extremely fast, leaving even early-stage Immortal Kings and late-stage True Immortals behind.

"Join forces, kill him!" As Luo Tian took a step, nine figures soared into the sky.

"Ten Palace disciples, form a formation and kill Luo Tian!" At the same time, several palace late-stage Immortal Kings shouted to the millions of soldiers.

Roar...

Countless Hell ghosts roared, their voices filled with battle spirit; millions of people began to move, a wild wave of energy rising from the ground.

At the same time, nine late-stage Immortal Kings attacked Luo Tian's proximity, striking him with nine powerful attacks. The sky trembled.

"Move... whoever blocks me, I'll kill them!" Luo Tian's eyes showed cruelty; his hands moved rapidly. The "World of Law" manifested, and his body transformed into a thousand zhang tall. He took one step forward!

Boom... Boom... Boom...

The thunderous sound shook the heavens; in an instant, Luo Tian's massive foot collided with the nine attacks. His body was pushed back.

The nine were late-stage Immortal Kings, their attack strength naturally formidable; even Luo Tian could barely withstand all nine attacks at once. Blood instantly flowed from his mouth.

"Rending Sky Spear!"

As Luo Tian steadied himself, nine more attacks rushed toward him. His eyes narrowed slightly; he raised his spear and thrust it forward.

Another nine booms, this time Luo Tian only took a few steps back; his complexion had returned to normal.

"Strong!" Seeing Luo Tian withstand their nine attacks, the nine late-stage Immortal Kings were shocked.

"His growth is too fast; back then, he was just a True Immortal, and we could kill him with ease. Now he's grown to this level!" One elder praised, even as an opponent, still admiring Luo Tian's strength.

"Jueying, are you not going to act?" Several Tianzun stepped into the sky, attacking Luo Tian while shouting at Jueying Tianzun standing on the ground.

"Friends, we are all from the same side; why be so ruthless?" Jueying Tianzun looked at the battle in the sky, his eyes filled with anxiety.

"His Holy Son is in danger; other palaces' formations are almost complete!" The Turning Wheel Palace's soldiers looked worried, as Luo Tian was currently a Heaven Yuan Sect disciple but still regarded as the Turning Wheel Palace's Holy Son in their hearts.

"Millions of people, fighting one person—do these palaces have any face left?" The Turning Wheel Palace's disciples became angry.

"Without Face, organize the formation and activate the Turning Wheel Formation; however, it's only defensive, not attacking Luo Tian!" Jueying Tianzun ordered the disciple Wu Mian beside him.

"Yes!" Wu Mian shouted, and the Turning Wheel Palace's disciples began to move; the Turning Wheel Formation started operating.

"Jue Tian Formation Complete!" As the Turning Wheel Palace disciples prepared their formation, a series of shouts echoed from the direction of Huang Tian Palace soldiers.

Chapter 2686: Blood Path ()

Yellow divine light rose from the ground, forming a yellow sword beam that slashed through the sky toward Luo Tian.

A formation of nearly a million people, a powerful formation from Huang Tian Palace, its power naturally shocking. It even surpassed the attacks of nine late-stage Immortal Kings.

Luo Tian's eyes showed seriousness as he gazed at the yellow sword beam, swinging his spear to meet it. However, the Rending Sky Spear emitted a wave of energy—this was the "Eight Directions and Ten Thousand Treasures" technique.

Crash...

In an instant, the Rending Sky Spear collided with the yellow sword beam. The sky collapsed as if the world had ended.

The yellow sword beam was shattered by Luo Tian's spear, but his body also retreated a thousand zhang, moving further away from the vast void rift.

"You won't pass!" The nine late-stage Immortal Kings' faces showed contempt; this Luo Tian was clearly seeking death. One person daring to enter the Hell army's camp—no matter if it was a late-stage Immortal King or even an early-stage Immortal King, it would be extremely difficult.

"Can't pass?" Luo Tian's massive body collapsed under the nine attacks, spitting blood and crashing into the ground, creating a deep pit.

Boom...

But instantly, Luo Tian seemed like an indestructible superpower, bursting out of the pit and startling everyone.

"Looks like I need to use something real!" Luo Tian muttered, sheathing the Rending Sky Spear and drawing the broken sword Zhusian.

"What is this? A broken sword with rust!" People looked at Luo Tian's Zhusian, their eyes filled with confusion; it seemed like a broken sword.

"This sword is no ordinary one!" However, those with cultivation above Immortal King looked at the broken sword and their faces turned serious.

"Everyone, strike with all your might!"

"Ten Crows Over the Sky!" Huang Tian Palace's late-stage Immortal King shouted, his hands moving rapidly. A flock of yellow crows flew from the strong's hand.

"Ga... ga..." The shrill sound echoed in the sky, yellow crows covering the heavens and rushing toward Luo Tian.

"Equal Print!"

"No Hua Sword!" Others also struck, nine devastating attacks rushing toward Luo Tian.

The void collapsed; the sky roared. More terrifying was that, besides Huang Tian Palace's "Jue Tian Formation" being successful, other palaces' formations also activated.

"Funeral Formation Complete... Ghost-Refining Formation Complete..." A series of shouts echoed, and with the nine late-stage Immortal Kings' attacks, a total of eighteen attacks—each capable of killing a late-stage Immortal King.

The devastating wave spread across the world; the Turning Wheel Palace's formation operated, resisting the pressure of these eighteen attacks. Otherwise, just the pressure and waves would have killed early-stage and mid-stage True Immortals.

Luo Tian's heart clenched; the eighteen attacks were too strong, each requiring his full attention.

"Swallow Heaven!" However, Luo Tian didn't fear; he opened his mouth and sucked in the wind and clouds. A wild vortex formed above him, sucking them in.

Roar...

The yellow crows rushed forward and instantly reached Luo Tian's proximity, while Luo Tian opened his mouth and spat out a roar. The sound of a dragon echoed across the world, shaking the heavens.

One roar shattered mountains and rivers; everyone's ears felt a thunderous sound, their eyes filled with pain.

As Luo Tian roared, the yellow crows that Huang Tian Palace's late-stage Immortal King had summoned were annihilated by his roar.

"Blade of Chaos!"

After Luo Tian's roar, he didn't pay attention to the countless yellow crows but instead punched toward the sky. His fists left afterimages, eight punches merging and colliding with a silver seal descending from above.

Divine light rained down; the seal shattered on Luo Tian's head, and a wild wave spread in all directions, striking Luo Tian.

"One Sword Against the Immortals!" Luo Tian struck again, his broken sword Zhusian expanding dramatically. Yellow divine light formed a devastating attack that slashed toward another fierce ghost face approaching Luo Tian.

"Ao..." A mournful roar echoed, and the fierce ghost face was instantly split open by Luo Tian's sword.

The domain expanded; a thousand souls howled, and gray divine souls merged with the sword energy, gathering toward Luo Tian's broken Zhusian.

"Blade of Heaven and Earth!" Luo Tian roared, as if absorbing the entire domain into a towering sword, then striking again.

Boom... Boom...

The thunderous sound never ceased; Luo Tian kept attacking, each strike filled with overwhelming divine power, colliding with the remaining techniques.

Five... seven...

Each powerful attack was dismantled by Luo Tian, who used all his strength to withstand the attacks.

Thirteen...

After the thirteenth attack, Luo Tian could barely hold on; his body was pushed back and six more attacks with devastating energy rushed toward him.

Luo Tian's face was pale, but the Hell army wasn't doing well either; nine late-stage Immortal Kings' faces were also grim. In the formations, countless True Immortals had shattered into blood mist, scattered across the ground.

"Looks like I need to use you!" Luo Tian chuckled and turned his hand, the copper mirror appearing in his palm, expanding instantly.

"Evil Offspring Mirror? A mere top-tier ghost artifact—do you think it can block us?" The nine late-stage Immortal Kings showed contempt.

They knew the Evil Offspring Mirror and its power, but it couldn't withstand the remaining formations' attacks.

Buzz...

A world-destroying divine light rose, and as this light shot from the Evil Offspring Mirror, the world fell silent. Even the remaining six attacks seemed to be overshadowed by this light.

"What is this?" The nine late-stage Immortal Kings' eyes showed fear, sensing the terrifying annihilating light. They felt that they couldn't survive under this light.

"Three more!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his cultivation activated, and the second and third annihilating lights erupted, sweeping out.

Boom... Boom... Boom...

Six resounding explosions shook the heavens, spreading outward and nearly reaching the vast void rift of the frontline.

Crash...

At the same time, hundreds of thousands maintaining six powerful formations collapsed; many fell down with blood spilling from their mouths. Countless figures were instantly scattered.

Blood stained the ground; the nine late-stage Immortal Kings' faces trembled, gazing at Luo Tian by the Evil Offspring Mirror.

Too strong! Luo Tian's strength exceeded their expectations; just that one collision had cost the Hell army twenty to thirty thousand losses, with many injured.

Luo Tian sneered and took the opportunity to grab the Evil Offspring Mirror, rushing toward the void rift. The Hell army no longer blocked him because the nine late-stage Immortal Kings ordered him to pass—Luo Tian had carved a blood path with his strength.

Chapter 2687: Receiving ()

The Hell army still had the ability to fight, but they feared losses. After all, the upper three realms hadn't been fully taken; they didn't know how many more annihilating lights Luo Tian's Evil Offspring Mirror could unleash. If they lost too much, it would be a disaster.

"What is he going to do in the frontline?" Watching Luo Tian rush into the void rift, several late-stage Immortal Kings descended from the sky and discussed.

"Who cares? He's now a target in the Immortal Realm; he might die there!" The late-stage Immortal King from Huang Tian Palace said with mockery.

"One person alone against millions of Hell forces, nine late-stage Immortal Kings attacking, and even the Ten Palaces' formations blocking—yet he still passed through! And he killed twenty to thirty thousand people! This is too shocking!" The Hell soldiers, however, discussed with reverence; Hell always respected strength.

"Besides the Immortal King peak, no one can harm the Holy Son!" The Turning Wheel Palace's people were elated, watching Luo Tian leave. But they sighed longingly after that because now Luo Tian was no longer a Turning Wheel Palace disciple.

"Rest easy; this kid always repays kindness. If the Turning Wheel Palace has any issues, he'll still stand up for us!" Jueying Tianzun smiled, gazing at Luo Tian leaving.

...

Luo Tian rushed into the vast rift, instantly feeling a pulling force on his body, trying to drag him into that black abyss.

But this pulling force was strong; however, it was like nothing to Luo Tian—only True Immortals were threatened.

"Truly ruthless; they've filled the rift to this extent!" Luo Tian muttered, flying for a moment before exiting the rift's range of several ten thousand zhang.

But the sky remained dark; after flying for half a day, the colors gradually turned light blue. Luo Tian's face showed admiration; he hadn't seen a clear sky in a long time.

Luo Tian descended to the ground, sitting down immediately upon landing; blood flowed from his mouth.

"It's not easy at all!" Luo Tian felt like he was completely broken, after all, the Hell army wasn't easy to break through. He had seemed fine before but was just giving those nine late-stage Immortal Kings a false impression.

Luo Tian sat and cultivated, breathing in the fresh air while his body emitted a crackling sound. His injuries rapidly healed.

Two days later, Luo Tian's wounds were fully recovered; he stood up and gazed around.

The Frontline, Bai Family...

Luo Tian muttered softly, knowing the Frontline's power was vast in the middle three realms but hadn't expected this frontline to be like another world.

"If it weren't for the Hell army's attack, no sect in the middle three realms could cross this void rift to attack Bai Family!" Luo Tian marveled; the Frontline was truly a place of easy defense and difficult attack, with rich Immortal energy.

Luo Tian walked through the forest, extending his spiritual sense but found no one. He stepped on the ground, his gaze filled with confusion; he flew into the sky and looked far.

A mountain appeared in Luo Tian's view—no need to think, that was the Bai Family's base.

"Perhaps the remaining people in the middle three realms are all there!" Luo Tian smiled.

The strength of the middle three realms, Luo Tian was clear; he was confident no one could harm him.

Luo Tian flew through the sky toward the mountain in his view, calm and unhurried, but filled with confusion.

"According to logic, the outer part of the void rift should have scouts; why is there no one?"

"Did they really enter the upper three realms?" Luo Tian muttered, his eyes filled with bitterness.

Buzz...

As Luo Tian was confused, waves of energy erupted from the mountain, connecting heaven and earth with nine-colored divine light.

At this moment, Luo Tian was ten thousand zhang away from the mountain; on the mountain, people moved and voices of joy echoed from within the light, making Luo Tian's face change.

"Finally left!"

"I don't believe those Hell forces can reach the upper three realms!" A series of voices filled with relief echoed.

"Receiving Light!" Luo Tian exclaimed, as if recalling something; his feet emitted a wild wave toward the nine-colored light.

Ten thousand zhang... eight thousand zhang...

In an instant, Luo Tian reached the light's front. He also fully saw the vast nine-colored light.

A hundred-mile range of nine-colored divine light, massive and powerful, radiating overwhelming energy, piercing through the heavens. The sky above seemed to have a hole; it was unclear where this nine-colored light led.

Boom... Boom...

As Luo Tian was stunned, a series of mountains rose from the ground as if pulled by an invisible force.

"This is leaving the middle three realms; they've given up!" Luo Tian realized, without hesitation, flying toward the nine-colored receiving light.

"How come someone is here? Someone didn't make it in!" As Luo Tian rushed toward the receiving light, people within the light noticed him immediately and began to discuss. They thought it was someone who hadn't received the news, left outside.

"Too pitiful; this receiving light was set up by several Immortal Kings, no one else could enter!" People whispered, gazing at Luo Tian rushing toward the receiving light.

But then, they opened their mouths in shock; because this light, which was so powerful, seemed to have no effect on that figure. That person simply rushed in.

"Divine being! Who is this man, and which faction does he belong to?" Everyone was shocked, gazing at Luo Tian.

"What is this character? It's so familiar!" A young man looked puzzled, his back carrying a long sword—this was the current Bai Family head, Bai Tian.

"Ghost Valley!"

"Luo Tian!" The young man's words hadn't finished when a series of exclamations echoed within the receiving light, three to five hundred thousand people's faces filled with disbelief as they gazed at Luo Tian appearing in their view.

"Everyone, it's been a long time!" Luo Tian stopped his body, feeling pulled by a force. He didn't resist and landed on the tall mountain peak, gazing at Bai Tian and others.

"How are you here?" Bai Tian's eyes showed complexity; they had all entered Supplement Heaven City together, and Luo Tian had once helped him. Bai Tian had said then that Luo Tian was his friend. However, times had changed; Luo Tian was a Hell person who had led an attack on Supplement Heaven City. This matter was known throughout the Immortal Realm; in terms of factions, they were now enemies.
