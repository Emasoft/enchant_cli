“Ha ha, I truly am a genius! Even the Ultimate Star was refined by me!” However, as Ye Liangchen spoke, his previous imposing image vanished instantly, causing people’s mouths to twitch.

“I thought I was mistaken, but this is our Liangchen Daoist!” The crowd erupted into laughter, their gazes turning to Ye Liangchen, who wore a mocking expression.

“Go!” Ye Liangchen gazed at the blood-red hand, his eyes slightly cold. He then produced an object resembling a luminous pearl and hurled it directly at the blood-red hand.

“Peng…” The pearl collided with the blood-red hand, and it exploded in a burst of crimson.

“Weng…” Before people could react, a powerful suction force spread outward, drawing them into the spatial rift.

Figures flickered as multiple silhouettes appeared on the central plaza of Star River Mansion, their faces bewildered.

“Damn it, I was so close! I almost obtained that spiritual herb!” As the figures fully materialized, a chorus of lamentations arose.

“Where is that masked man?” Luoyi landed and surveyed the surroundings, failing to locate the masked figure.

“Luoyi, do you know your crime?”

“In the Washing Star Pool, competition was allowed, but killing was forbidden. Yet you disregarded kinship and mercilessly slaughtered Star River Ye clan members, even humiliating them!” Amid the chaos, a solemn voice echoed in their ears.

The previous elders materialized above, their gazes cold as they fixed on Luoyi. With no immortal weapon on his person, this was the perfect moment to kill him. After deliberation, they resolved to eliminate Luoyi at all costs.

Chapter 2006: Immortal King’s Mandate

“Hua…” Upon hearing the elders’ words, Star River Mansion disciples erupted in murmurs, their gazes filled with admiration as they looked at Luoyi.

“Seize him!” One elder stepped forward, extending his hand toward Luoyi without granting him a chance to explain.

A golden hand descended upon Luoyi’s head, its aura overwhelming, darkening his face.

“Ye Cheng, you’ve gone too far by disregarding Star River Mansion’s authority!” Yet before the hand could descend, Ye Wudao stood beside Luoyi, his expression icy.

At that moment, Ye Wudao had been searching for the masked man since Luoyi and others emerged from the Washing Star Pool. Now that Luoyi was threatened, Ye Wudao naturally intervened to protect him.

“Peng…” A green hand clashed with the golden one, rendering it into a gust of wind that vanished from sight.

“Lord, you witnessed Luoyi’s murder. Star River Ye clan’s millions of disciples saw it clearly. Do you intend to shield him?” Ye Han shouted, his gaze unkind toward Luoyi.

“You must die, son. Though you failed to kill him in the Washing Star Pool, you will still perish after exiting. Blame yourself for becoming Star River Mansion’s Daoist!” Ye Han’s voice echoed in Luoyi’s mind.

“Everyone saw clearly—those men sought to kill me! Did I have a choice but to resist?” Luoyi retorted coldly.

“Reckless! As your elder, who are you to argue?” Ye Han barked. This time, however, he did not act, for Ye Wudao stood like a mountain beside Luoyi.

“Lord Ye, let us deliberate further. Everyone saw the truth—Luoyi is at fault, but his punishment should not be death. A simple reprimand and referral to the Iron Blood Hall would suffice,” Ye Wudao smiled, his gaze meeting Ye Han’s.

“Lord Ye, your actions seem biased,” Ye Han countered, his gaze on Ye Wudao. Who didn’t know the Iron Blood Hall was under Ye’s control?

“Lord Ye, are you questioning my decision?” Ye Wudao coldly replied, locking eyes with Ye Han.

The elders behind Ye Han wore anxious expressions, their gazes on Ye Wudao. At this moment, they dared not act; to do so would be insubordination.

“You are the Lord, of course we dare not question you. But if this Luoyi is not punished, I fear the clan may rebel. You risk favoritism by shielding your own foster son,” Ye Han said coldly.

“Though Luoyi defended himself, he still killed several people.”

“Rumors claim Luoyi is ruthless and bloodthirsty. The rumors were correct!” As Ye Han’s words ended, the disciples murmured among themselves.

“Weng…” Just as Ye Han gloated toward Ye Wudao, a wave of energy rose behind his head.

“Dang…” A golden sphere smashed into Ye Han’s skull, causing people to gasp.

Ye Han was dazed by the golden sphere, his body nearly collapsing as he swayed violently. A large swelling grew rapidly on his head.

“Lord Ye Han, I’m going to kill you—why don’t you just stand there and let me?” Ye Liangchen held a golden sphere, lounging casually.

“Ha ha…” The crowd erupted into laughter, several aristocrats chuckling as they gazed at Ye Han’s swollen head.

“You…” Ye Han’s face reddened, his gaze burning toward Ye Liangchen. He never expected this sudden attack.

Yet the golden sphere was incredibly hard, its power immense. If Ye Han were not a late-stage Immortal, Ye Liangchen’s strike might have cracked his skull.

“Ha ha! With this sphere in hand, I’ve got it all—no one dares bully me anymore!” Ye Liangchen laughed arrogantly, leaving people speechless.

Ye Han observed Ye Liangchen but held back; he knew Ye Liangchen’s status. While Luoyi might dare to act, Ye Liangchen was untouchable. If they acted now, it would be a full-blown confrontation.

“Lord, execute Luoyi! Otherwise I won’t accept it!” Ye Han said, his face grim but still addressing Ye Wudao.

“Lord, punish Luoyi! Otherwise we won’t accept it!” A senior echoed, and soon, Star River Mansion disciples joined in.

“Punish him by imprisoning him in the Star Jail for three days, then send him to Bu City to guard Hell!” Ye Wudao gazed at them, his expression slightly cold.

“Too light!” Ye Han responded immediately upon hearing Ye Wudao’s words.

“Ye Han, I gave you this courtesy because you are a senior. Don’t be so ungrateful!” Ye Wudao’s voice turned icy, his gaze piercing.

Seeing Ye Wudao’s intent to retaliate, Ye Han quickly stopped, his eyes filled with resentment. He never expected losing several disciples yet letting Luoyi live.

“Star River Mansion receives the Immortal King’s mandate!” Amid the chaos, a solemn voice echoed across the land. Several long streaks of light pierced the sky, appearing above Star River Mansion.

Normally, no one dared to act recklessly in Star River Mansion’s airspace. These figures’ arrival left the disciples speechless, for they hailed from Bu Mountain.

Several figures radiated formidable power; the leader was a youth, with several middle-aged men behind him.

The youth was tall and slender, his white robe fluttering as his long hair flowed. His gaze swept over Star River Mansion’s disciples, then he descended.

“Hail the Bu Immortal King!” Ye Wudao and others bowed respectfully, their gazes filled with reverence.

“Star River Mansion receives the decree!”

“Hell has erupted; Bu City is in crisis. The mandate commands three sects’ disciples to be conscripted early. Each sect’s Daoist must lead ten attendants. One month later, they will head to Bu City to guard Hell!” The youth spoke, raising his hand. A golden scroll flew from his palm.

The scroll unfurled, revealing bold characters in the sky, a pressure spreading across the land as if issuing an imperial command.

“Even one line of text gives me a sense of immense pressure!” Luoyi’s eyes flickered. No need to guess—only a superpower could write such characters.

“Star River Mansion, accept the decree!” Ye Wudao grabbed the scroll and spoke clearly.

“Ha ha, Uncle Ye, it’s been a while!” After receiving the scroll, the youth smiled and nodded to Ye Wudao.

“Big brother, why did you come yourself?” Before Ye Wudao could reply, Ye Liangchen leaped beside the youth, his face alight with excitement.

“Nothing much—my illness has passed, so I came out for a walk. I heard Luoyi was in Star River Mansion, so I checked in.” The youth spoke softly, then scanned the crowd before settling on Luoyi.

The visitor was none other than Jiang Yuzhe, the ninth son of Bu Mountain’s Immortal King.

Luoyi’s face reddened as he recalled the incident where Jiang Yuyu had stolen his Bu Token. He felt a pang of guilt toward Jiang Yuzhe.

“Luoyi, your fame has spread widely!” Jiang Yuzhe laughed heartily, his eyes filled with satisfaction.

“Brother Yuzhe, it’s just empty fame!” Luoyi smiled and nodded.

“Hear you met my brother Yuyu? I know about it. Don’t take it to heart. Take this—this time, don’t lose it again!” Jiang Yuzhe smiled and waved his hand. A green token flew from his palm, landing beside Luoyi.

“Bu Token!” The crowd gasped, even Ye Wudao and Ye’s expressions shifted.

“This…” Luoyi furrowed his brow but did not accept the token, speaking softly: “Brother Yuzhe, this Bu Token is too precious. You already gave me one before; I lost it. I’ll find it again. I cannot accept the second token!”

Though Luoyi did not say it outright, he knew Jiang Yuzhe understood.

“…”

“Brother Yuzhe, you already gave him one Bu Token? Now you want to give the second?”

“Yet he refused! He doesn’t know Brother Yuzhe only has three Bu Tokens!” The crowd’s mouths twitched as they watched Luoyi, even Ye Wudao and Ye looked speechless.

“Fine, I’ll reclaim it. When the time comes, I’ll call you!” Jiang Yuzhe smiled and turned to Star River Mansion’s disciples.

“Uncle Ye, what happened here? I saw it was lively!” Jiang Yuzhe looked puzzled at the bustling Star River Mansion.

“Ha ha, big brother, you don’t know—someone tried to kill my brother…” Before Ye Wudao could speak, Ye Liangchen’s mouth spewed like a cannon, recounting the incident.

“Ah, I see!” Jiang Yuzhe smiled, his gaze turning to Ye Han’s sweating face.

“Kill him!” Jiang Yuzhe pointed his finger at Ye Han, causing Ye Han’s face to pale.

Chapter 2007: Guarding Hell

“Lord Jiang, this is a misunderstanding! It’s all a mistake!” Upon hearing Jiang Yuzhe’s words, the men accompanying him were stunned but flew forward toward Ye Han.

“Lord Jiang, you cannot interfere in Star River Mansion’s internal affairs!” Ye Han shouted, slapping his palm against one of Jiang Yuzhe’s men. Though he was struck by three elders, blood spewed from his mouth.

Though Ye Han spat blood, the other elders dared not utter a word; if they spoke, they would suffer too.

“Ah…” Ye Han roared, his aura surging as he fought harder, realizing the four men attacking him meant to kill him.

“Back then when Luoyi was killed, what did you say? You fought back!”

“But the only difference is Luoyi could counterattack, while you lack the strength to fight my men!” Jiang Yuzhe smirked, his gaze playful and cold.

“Good, with Brother Yuzhe’s intervention, these old bastards will learn a lesson!” Ye Wudao watched Ye Han spitting blood.

Though Ye Han was a late-stage Immortal, Jiang Yuzhe’s men were no pushovers—four late-stage Immortals and four mid-stage ones, their power terrifying.

Soon, Ye Han lay like a dead dog on the ground, his eyes weak.

“Grand Elder, save me!” Ye Han roared, using his last strength, his voice echoing across Star River Mansion.

“There’s an unexpected gain!” Ye Wudao’s eyes flickered. He knew Star River Mansion’s elders had supporters for secession, but he still didn’t know who.

“Lord Ye, I’ll grant you a favor!” Jiang Yuzhe waved his hand, and the four late-stage Immortals stopped.

“Brother Yuzhe, please grant me a slight favor and release this ungrateful son. I’ll send a gift to Bu Mountain as thanks!” A aged voice echoed, and an elder descended from the sky, his tone resigned.

The elder’s white hair flowed like a painting of an immortal, his eyes bearing the weight of years. He landed before Jiang Yuzhe.

“Respect Grand Elder!” Star River Mansion disciples bowed respectfully, their reverence surpassing even when they received the Bu Immortal King’s decree.

Star River Mansion and Bu Mountain were hierarchical but interdependent; elder immortals knew each other. Thus, Jiang Yuzhe bowed to the Grand Elder.

“Since Grand Elder Ye Ding has come, I cannot say much—release him!” Jiang Yuzhe smiled softly. The four men returned to his side.

“But, Grand Elder Ye Ding, I have one thing to say: Luoyi is my brother. Who dares harm him, I Jiang Yuzhe will not let it pass!” Jiang Yuzhe spoke softly.

“Of course, Luoyi is Star River Mansion’s genius and Daoist—his status is noble. He must be protected!” Ye Ding smiled, his gaze toward Luoyi like a kind elder.

Luoyi bowed respectfully but knew Ye Ding likely wished to skin him alive for exposing his allegiance against Ye Wudao.

“Enough, I’ll leave first—I have other sects to announce the decree. Brother Luoyi, we’ll chat later!” Jiang Yuzhe nodded to Luoyi and flew into the sky.

“Uncle Ye, Grand Elder Ye Ding, I’ll take my leave!” Jiang Yuzhe bowed to the two and vanished from Luoyi’s sight.

“Hmph, having a powerful father is great! I heard Brother Jiang Yuzhe once had a chronic illness but still holds power. Though he’s not as influential as other princes, no one dares provoke him!” Star River Mansion disciples murmured, their faces filled with envy.

“Alright, disperse! Wudao, have Liangchen prepare—Star River Mansion’s Hell guardians must be chosen carefully. The task is perilous, so ensure Liangchen and the disciples’ safety!” Ye Ding spoke softly, his gaze deep as he looked at Ye Wudao. He then vanished with Ye Han.

“Yes!” Ye Wudao bowed slightly, watching Ye Ding leave before smiling.

“Guarding Hell for three years!”

“Ten days later, the Hell expedition will be led by Liangchen. Ye Chen, Luoyi, Ye Fu, Qiuqiantai, and Ye Die will accompany as attendants.”

“The remaining five will compete in a tournament tomorrow. Those under a hundred years old may join. The top five will receive rewards and, upon returning after three years, be promoted to external elders!” Ye Wudao announced loudly.

“Promoted to external elder directly! My heavens!” Star River Mansion disciples erupted in excitement, their eyes alight.

“Hell is perilous; those who wish to join must think carefully, as each Hell expedition has an almost 80% mortality rate.”

“Great danger means great opportunity. During Hell’s guardianship, the nine immortal mountains’ rewards are also generous!”

“Is there anyone with objections?” Ye Wudao asked, his voice carrying a hint of amusement.

“No!” Star River Mansion disciples shouted in unison. Naturally, they had no complaints about Luoyi and Qiuqiantai being chosen; their strength was evident.

“Hell’s journey is my moment of redemption!” Qiuqiantai’s eyes gleamed, excitement in his gaze as he looked at Luoyi.

“During this Hell expedition, I’ll find a chance to eliminate both Luoyi and Liangchen. Ensure it’s done secretly, don’t expose yourselves—should you be discovered, no one can save you. You’ll even endanger us!”

“Don’t act without tenfold confidence,” a voice echoed in Ye Fu’s mind, causing his body to tremble.

“Big brother, I must thank you! Let’s go get some wine!” Ye Liangchen grabbed Luoyi and stepped out of the crowd.

“Little bastard, come back!” Ye Wudao barked, grabbing Ye Liangchen.

“You let him go to such a place with his injuries! Go and fully fuse the Tianji Star before you gallivant!” Ye Wudao barked, pushing Ye Liangchen far away. Star River Mansion disciples wanted to laugh but held back.

Luoyi smiled as he returned to his room, beginning recovery. One night was enough for him to regain peak condition.

The next day, Star River Mansion’s disciples didn’t spread the Washing Star Pool incident; they were all captivated by another major event.

Almost every disciple with some strength joined the competition, as guarding Hell was dangerous but worth it—Star River Mansion elders’ status was invaluable.

Luoyi, however, didn’t watch the commotion but secluded himself in his room, retrieving Ziyang Pills and studying their formula. He spent day and night analyzing it, hoping to decode it before heading to Bu City. His goal was to administer Ziyang Pills to Long Jie, transforming him into a human so he could stay in Star River Mansion with Diaodezhu.

Hell was perilous; Luoyi didn’t want Long Jie to risk it. Long Jie’s massive size made him too noticeable, while Diaodezhu was small and could accompany them.

Ye Liangchen also remained silent, not running around showing off, leaving Star River Mansion disciples who observed him puzzled.

On the third day of Luoyi’s analysis, Ye Wudao visited him, leading him to a grand hall.

“Creak…” The hall’s door opened, and Ye Wudao led Luoyi inside.

“Tian’er, as you’ve just joined Star River Mansion, you may choose one treasure, one technique, or one pill according to the Daoist’s privileges.”

“I’ve already selected these for you. I’m here to give them to you!” Ye Wudao smiled.

“The treasure I’ve chosen for you is very familiar. It’s not so much a choice as lending it to you—my Star River Mansion’s ancestral treasure, Star River Mansion!” Ye Wudao spoke, waving his hand to gift Luoyi a storage ring.

“What?” Upon hearing Ye Wudao’s words, Luoyi’s face changed. He never expected Ye Wudao to lend Star River Mansion to him.

“I’m lending it for three years; return it when you come back from Hell! This treasure can save your and Liangchen’s lives!”

“A technique—Father selected the Star-Grasping Art, a method to harness celestial energy and strengthen oneself. It’s simple and easy!”

“A pill—I noticed you’ve been studying Ziyang Pills, so I chose one. Also, a Star-Grasping Pill for your protection!” Ye Wudao continued, detailing the remaining items.

Upon hearing Ye Wudao’s explanation, Luoyi was stunned, gazing at him.

“As for Liangchen, he has many life-saving items and the Tianji Star—likely no problem. Remember to protect your lives! Life is fundamental!”

“If Liangchen faces danger, save him if possible. If not, don’t sacrifice yourself!” Ye Wudao spoke loudly.

“Also, these days, try to exchange your spirit stones for better items—spirit stones aren’t circulated in Bu City!” Ye Wudao reminded again.

“Yes!” At this moment, Luoyi was deeply moved by Ye Wudao. He felt Ye Wudao truly regarded him as a foster son, a family member. Though not as close as Liangchen, it was heartfelt.

Chapter 2008: Selling People

“There are other items you’ll definitely need—keep them all. Though guarding Hell is perilous, I believe your and Liangchen’s strength can handle the dangers.” Ye Wudao spoke, his gaze filled with concern.

“Of course, Father!” Luoyi replied, his heart even eager to head to Hell. Though he’d heard many legends about Hell in the Nine Domains, he felt a sense that going to Hell would bring great change. Also, in the Central Three Heavens, he’d found many people but still others eluded him.

Ye Wudao gave Luoyi further instructions, and he returned to his residence, continuing to study Ziyang Pills’ formula.

Star River Mansion’s competition raged on; three days passed swiftly.

That day, Luoyi sat in his room, eyes bloodshot, with jade slips spread before him. The slips were filled with dense script.

Suddenly, Luoyi’s bloodshot eyes flashed with clarity. He pointed his finger and recited: “He Shou Wu, Lingtai Cao…”

Names of herbs spilled from his mouth as he inscribed a new jade slip.

In an instant, nearly three hundred herb names appeared on the slip, and Luoyi sighed deeply.

“I’ve cracked it!” Luoyi whispered, then opened the door and grabbed the lounging Diaodezhu by the collar.

“Damn it…” Diaodezhu shouted, his fur standing on end as he gazed at Luoyi with suspicion.

“Eat it!” Luoyi waved his hand, sending Ziyang Pills to Diaodezhu. Another was injected into the Nirvana Dragon Seal.

“Ziyang Pills, you’ve cracked it?” Diaodezhu’s eyes lit up with joy. Without hesitation, he swallowed the pills.

“Weng…” A violent aura filled Luoyi’s room, causing it to tremble.

“What’s happening?” Ye Liangchen strolled into Luoyi’s courtyard, gazing at his room.

“Roar…” Dragon power surged, halting Ye Liangchen’s steps.

“Boom…” As Ye Liangchen marveled, Luoyi’s room finally collapsed, dust rising.

From the dust emerged three figures: Diaodezhu in purple robes, Long Jie in golden robes, and Luoyi.

“Ha ha! I’ve finally become human! Damn it, I was so cramped!” A loud laugh echoed.

“Big brother, who are they?” Ye Liangchen asked, his gaze on Diaodezhu and Long Jie.

“My brothers!”

“His previous dragon, and that purple sable!” Luoyi smiled, watching Long Jie and Diaodezhu’s excitement.

“Ha ha! So this is the little thing!” Ye Liangchen laughed, observing Diaodezhu’s sly demeanor.

“You’re the little thing! Your whole family is!” Diaodezhu shouted, jumping and yelling at Ye Liangchen.

“Cheap! Let’s go out for a joyride—our good times are about to end!” Ye Liangchen laughed, ignoring Diaodezhu’s words and dragging Luoyi toward Star River Mansion’s gates.

…

Huantian City remained lively. Luoyi and the others didn’t invite other aristocrats but arrived at Huantian City.

Though Star River Mansion allowed spirit stone exchanges, Ye Liangchen insisted on going out, so they came to Huantian City.

Huantian City’s strength matched that of the Central Three Heavens’ sects, and it had many markets where spirit stones could buy items.

The four first visited a grand restaurant, ordering a feast before strolling through Huantian City.

“Welcome to Huantian Market, sir! Here, we have everything—immortal weapons, pills, talismans. If you have spirit stones, anything is available!” The four soon arrived at Huantian City’s market. A servant greeted them respectfully.

“Lord Ye!” The servant recognized Ye Liangchen, his eyes gleaming with admiration.

Ye Liangchen was renowned across the Central Three Heavens as an aristocrat, generous to those who pleased him.

“Lord Ye! It’s been a while since you visited the market. What wind brought you? Our market is truly honored! I felt today I’d meet a nobleman, and here you are!” The servant spoke eloquently, praising Ye Liangchen.

“Ha ha! You speak well—reward!” Ye Liangchen waved his hand, tossing a pile of shimmering spirit stones to the servant.

“Thank you, Lord Ye!” The servant beamed, collecting the stones and becoming more respectful. He led Luoyi’s group deeper into the market.

“Buy, buy, buy…” That day, Luoyi and Ye Liangchen spent their wealth on shopping. Their riches were vast; they used five storage rings to carry items.

“I’ve gone broke!” Luoyi sighed, having only one million spirit stones left for Long Jie and Diaodezhu. Yet he felt satisfied, converting his entire fortune into combat power—this made him effectively have another life.

“Ha ha! Miss, are you broke? If so, follow the lord and I’ll feed you!” As they strolled out of the market, a series of lewd laughter echoed.

“Take this girl! One million spirit stones!” The voices rang in Luoyi’s ears.

“Can people be sold?” Luoyi furrowed his brow, asking the servant.

“Theoretically, it’s possible, but few sell people—such acts are disgraceful,” the servant replied cautiously. He had earned much on this trip, equivalent to years of work.

“Hmph, there are many people gathered! Many sects’ geniuses are here!” Ye Liangchen’s face showed curiosity as he gazed at the crowd, his eyes filled with intrigue.

Because of Hell’s suppression, all Central Three Heavens’ geniuses knew spirit stones were useless in Hell. Thus, some sought to exchange them for treasures.

As they reached the crowd’s edge, Luoyi and the others looked with curiosity.

“Ye Liangchen?” People recognized him, and these were Central Three Heavens’ geniuses, even some sects’ Daoists.

They made way for Ye Liangchen, knowing his reputation as a troublemaker. If they didn’t let him have fun, he’d cause chaos.

“Is that Luoyi behind Ye Liangchen?” Soon, people noticed Luoyi beside Ye Liangchen. Their gazes turned solemn; they had witnessed his battle at Huantian Coast.

“Ha ha! Hello, everyone!” Ye Liangchen greeted the sects’ geniuses, his expression proud as he entered the crowd.

A beggar sat on the ground, disheveled and ragged, yet radiating a powerful aura. Beside him sat a girl in disarray, her body filthy and eyes desperate, unable to scream due to a curse. She looked around twenty, her despair masked by beauty that drew glances.

“Damn it!” Ye Liangchen’s eyes turned red, cursing as he hurled a golden pearl toward the beggar.

“Yuran!” Luoyi also shouted, his Bow of Shooting the Sun hummed and rushed toward the beggar.

Everyone was stunned by Ye Liangchen and Luoyi’s actions, their faces filled with disbelief. They never expected them to dare act in Huantian City.

“They know this girl!” People realized instantly.

“Ugh…” Yuran’s desperate eyes turned excited.

The beggar opened his eyes, and a powerful pressure surged outward. His withered hand grasped the Tianji Star and the Bow of Shooting the Sun.

“Boom…” A gust of energy swept outward, knocking people away.

“Purple Qi from the East!”

“Dragon Emperor’s Seal!” Diaodezhu and Long Jie, unwilling to let Luoyi and Ye Liangchen suffer, unleashed their martial arts.

“Suck…” The beggar opened his mouth and sucked in the Dragon Emperor’s Seal, which instantly dissolved into a vortex. The beggar swallowed it and burped.

“This ragged old man is an Immortal King!” People gasped, their faces pale at the beggar’s effortless defense.

“How is this possible!” Ye Liangchen’s face showed disbelief, gazing at the beggar.

“Children, what do you want? To bully an old beggar?” The beggar spoke lazily, his gaze on Luoyi and the others. His aged eyes flickered with light.

“I am her brother!” Luoyi spoke coldly, then leaped into the air, his arm shaking as he retrieved the Bow of Shooting the Sun from the beggar’s grasp.

Chapter 2009: Jiang Yuanxiong
