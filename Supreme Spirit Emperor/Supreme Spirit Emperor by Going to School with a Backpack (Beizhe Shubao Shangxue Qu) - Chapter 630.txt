Only the human-shaped figure suddenly burst forth, long sword swirling, two blades colliding with the black blade.

"Crack..." A thunderous explosion echoed in Luo Tian's ears, a storm sweeping him away, the seventy-eighth layer shuddering under an invisible power, its barrier cracking with a resounding sound.

"Boom..." Luo Tian's body crashed into the ground, blood spewing from his mouth, yet his eyes remained fixed on the storm.

"Success!" Luo Tian, Supplementing Heaven Stone, and the artifact spirit spoke in unison, witnessing the nine-colored lightning body and the gray figure annihilated by Luo Tian's single strike.

The storm vanished, Luo Tian struggled to rise, his body still carrying a trace of demonic energy. His gaze turned toward the sky's lingering storm clouds.

"Destiny cannot be defied!" A sudden feeling surged within Luo Tian; if he hadn't provoked the Dao, he might have ascended to Immortal King.

"Buzz..." A gray longbow凝聚, a gray spear materialized, clashing sounds echoed. The gray spear transformed into a streak of light, instantly appearing before Luo Tian.

"Spurt..." Blood gushed from Luo Tian's shoulder as the gray spear pierced his body, pinning him to the ground.

Chapter 2373: The King Monument ()

The gray spear pierced Luo Tian's shoulder, pinning him to the earth. His face was pale, eyes gazing at the darkened sky.

"Get up!" Luo Tian roared, attempting to rise but failing, realizing he was restrained by an invisible force.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian's face darkened, watching the rolling clouds. A gray stone monument emerged in his vision, radiating supreme power.

The gray monument bore names etched upon it; Luo Tian's eyes flashed like lightning, recognizing the names.

"This is the King Monument! If you carve your name here, you become an Immortal King!" Supplementing Heaven Stone shouted.

Seeing the names on the monument, Luo Tian's heart trembled with exhilaration, recognizing familiar names like Diao Yuanshan, Fu Tianqing, Zhang Daotian. Even the names of elders like Wang Duantian and Jun Moshang appeared on the monument.

"Senior masters, you've all ascended to Immortal King!" Luo Tian murmured internally, eyes filled with bitterness. His demonic energy was nearly depleted, while the gray spear drained his strength relentlessly.

"Supplementing Heaven Stone, how do I get out of this?" Luo Tian cursed, watching the gray monument expand.

"Ten zhang... hundred zhang... thousand zhang..." The monument surged, instantly expanding to ten thousand zhang, radiating a suppressing aura as it slowly descended upon Luo Tian.

"Kid, run! It'll crush you! If you can't carve your name, it'll kill you!" Supplementing Heaven Stone bellowed.

"What to do?" Luo Tian's forehead sweat dripped, his mind racing. Finally, he slowly raised his arm and grasped the gray spear.

"Open!" Luo Tian roared, blood boiling in his body, veins bulging as he ignited his essence. At this moment, no sacrifice meant death.

Luo Tian's body shrank rapidly, becoming a skeleton with only his right arm thick and powerful.

"Boom..." At the moment the King Monument pressed down five thousand zhang, Luo Tian yanked out the gray spear and held it.

"Hurry! Time's up!" Supplementing Heaven Stone shouted, watching Luo Tian appear exhausted.

"Must carve it!" In the Wheel Turning Hall, Hei Bai Wu Chang's eyes also showed anxiety. The black-robed Luo Tian was equally drained.

The artifact spirit watched the scene, its heart tightening with anticipation for Luo Tian's success.

"Wait... is this not a mutual enmity?" The artifact spirit shook its head, dismissing the thought.

Luo Tian panted heavily, like a desiccated corpse, gripping the spear that pinned him. He waved his hand, carving onto the King Monument.

"Crack..." The gray spear carved into the monument, sparks flying. A gray imprint appeared on the King Monument.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian panted, his right arm withering as he felt the spear's immense weight. His body was at its limit.

"Again..." Luo Tian's eyes burned with defiance, unleashing his remaining potential and swinging the spear again.

"One stroke... two strokes..." Sparks flew, gray fragments falling from the monument.

"Ten thousand zhang... five thousand zhang..." Meanwhile, the King Monument continued descending, nearing Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." At the moment Luo Tian carved the final stroke, he collapsed to the ground. The monument halted abruptly, and his name appeared on it.

As Luo Tian's name materialized, the entire Immortal Realm—and even Hell—felt a single name: Luo Tian.

In the Tianyuan Sect, Xiang Tianming's eyes gleamed with joy. As an Immortal King himself, he sensed Luo Tian's ascension.

"Success!" Supplementing Heaven Stone shouted, voice trembling with excitement.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian succeeded, he noticed his domain also completed. A gray domain spanning ten thousand zhang enveloped him, granting absolute control within its range. Every breeze and grass movement was sensed by Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's eyes glowed with joy, gazing at the gray monument. Yet as he reveled, the two characters "Luo Tian" on the monument gradually dimmed, as if erased by an unseen force.

"What's happening?" Everyone was stunned. Luo Tian stared at the gray characters, frowning, feeling his qualification stripped away.

"Unapproved by the Dao!" Hei Bai Wu Chang gasped, watching Luo Tian's name vanish.

"Haha! Luo Tian, you wanted to ascend to Immortal King, but Heaven won't help!" Zhi Hong's eyes gleamed with joy.

"Kid, next time we meet, I'll kill you!" Zhi Hong's gaze turned fierce, seated on the eightieth layer. He felt Luo Tian's mark fade from his heart, his aura gradually rising.

"Disapproved of me?" Luo Tian's withered eyes flashed coldness, slowly standing upright.

"I, Luo Tian, don't need anyone's approval!" Luo Tian shouted, watching the gray monument vanish. As it faded, his formidable domain began to weaken, as if drained of power.

"Want to take my domain? Why?" Luo Tian's anger surged.

"Bang..." A轮回 punch was thrown, the Reincarnation Passage appeared. Another punch shattered a gap in the passage, countless神魂 (souls) roaring out, surrounding Luo Tian.

Thousands of souls paid homage, their gray eyes filled with reverence and madness. Countless souls emerged from the Reincarnation Passage, bound by Luo Tian.

"I need your help!" Luo Tian whispered, his body radiating a terrifying aura. The countless souls roared fiercely, spitting out gray mist toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's hands moved swiftly, refining the soul energy into divine laws, enveloping him within a thousand zhang. It was the Heaven-Man Dao Law.

"Buzz..." A gray barrier enveloped Luo Tian, spanning a thousand zhang.

"This domain is called the Reincarnation Domain!" Luo Tian coldly declared, his gaunt body radiating a terrifying aura.

"Roar..." Souls roamed around Luo Tian, howling like worshippers of their king.

The heavens and earth trembled, the eighth layer transformed into a soul world. Luo Tian gazed at the souls.

"Thank you, your next life will be smooth!" Luo Tian whispered, sending an imprint from his hand onto the souls.

"Go!" Luo Tian whispered, allowing the souls to re-enter the Reincarnation Passage.

"Kid, you always cause me trouble!" Hei Bai Wu Chang shouted from the Wheel Turning Plate, its powerful voice echoing through the passage into Luo Tian's ears.

"Big brother, help!" Luo Tian shouted toward the Reincarnation Passage, knowing Hei Bai Wu Chang would assist.

"Damn kid, play enough and come back! If you don't return soon, I'll kill your next life!" Hei Bai Wu Chang scolded, slapping the black-robed Luo Tian.

"Too变态 (too extreme), how did he come up with this?" The artifact spirit's face showed disbelief, amazed at Luo Tian's domain creation.

"It's over..." Both Luos sat on the ground, watching the Reincarnation Passage heal. The secondary body was fine, but the main body had reached its limit.

Luo Tian quickly took out a pill, swallowed it, and sat cross-legged to recover.

"Kid, let you rest first; I'll kill you next!" The artifact spirit opened its permissions, delaying Luo Tian's descent.

Time passed slowly; Luo Tian's body recovered under the pill's support, his eyes opening.

"Thank you!" Luo Tian smiled, surprising Supplementing Heaven Stone and Yinyu.

"You're welcome! You're welcome!" Supplementing Heaven Stone, thick-skinned, approached Luo Tian.

"Kid, you're truly a genius. I've seen the most gifted..." "But next time, share some of your rewards with me so I can recover my strength," Supplementing Heaven Stone requested.

"Kid, you're really amazing! I admire you!" Yinyu's voice echoed, having watched Luo Tian grow.

"But where is the old master?" Yinyu then questioned, noticing the name of the God-Master on the King Monument.

"Many are here!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with a smile, believing the news of his fellow elders' survival was more important than ascending to Immortal King.

"Where is the Ancient Ancestor?" Luo Tian then questioned, seeing many familiar names on the monument but not Gu Tianshu.

"I've ascended to Immortal King; if I can exit, once the Tianyuan Sect stabilizes, Jiang Senior will take me to find the Ancient Ancestor," Luo Tian murmured. He gazed at his form vanishing from the seventy-eighth layer.

Luo Tian appeared in the seventy-ninth layer, a powerful pressure descending upon him, yet his face bore a smile.

Chapter 2374: Breaking the Eightieth Layer ()

A suppressing aura enveloped Luo Tian's body. He smiled, gazing at an old man standing opposite him.

The old man was withered, eyes迷茫 (confused), yet his sharp teeth glinted coldly.

"An Immortal King-level zombie?" Luo Tian whispered, observing the withered old man. Though seemingly strong, he was still inferior to a true Immortal King-level opponent.

This strength suited Luo Tian's current state, as he had just ascended to Immortal King. This level would help him consolidate his cultivation.

"Roar..." As he spoke, the Immortal King-level zombie leapt forward, rushing toward Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." Two withered arms rose, long nails glinting coldly, reaching for Luo Tian.

Luo Tian stood still, ignoring the old man's attack. He reached out, directly grasping the zombie's severed虚空 (void) hand.

"Crack..." In an instant, Luo Tian's hand collided with the icy nails. Luo Tian grabbed the cold arm and slammed it to the ground, the zombie transforming into a streak of light, crashing into the earth.

"Good!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with satisfaction, watching the roaring zombie charge again. He threw another punch.

"Crack..." This time, the zombie's nails shattered, and even its arms cracked repeatedly, making it roar.

"Buzz..." The zombie's body vanished, its aura disappearing. Luo Tian narrowed his eyes, gazing around, puzzled—he couldn't sense the old man's presence.

"Interesting!" Luo Tian muttered, his hands moving, invisible waves radiating from them. The waves instantly enveloped a thousand zhang, roaring throughout the heavens and earth. Within this domain, countless souls wandered, their cold eyes watching Luo Tian's surroundings.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian's domain appeared, the zombie suddenly materialized behind him, its icy fangs biting toward his neck.

"Get out!" Luo Tian roared, turning abruptly and punching the zombie's head.

"Boom..." The zombie's head exploded under Luo Tian's fist, its body falling to the ground.

"Too weak!" Luo Tian muttered, confidence in his eyes. Previously, he would have fought a fierce battle against the zombie, but now it was destroyed in three punches.

The scene shifted; Luo Tian's body appeared in the eightieth layer's rest space, his eyes filled with admiration. He would have chosen to rest here before, but now he was confident enough to push further, worthy of becoming the tower's master.

"Luo Tian!" As Luo Tian appeared, Zhi Hong, seated and resting, gasped, then turned fierce.

"Again!" Seeing Zhi Hong, Luo Tian's eyes brightened.

"Kid, you didn't ascend to Immortal King, but my strength has improved. What do you have to fight me with?" Zhi Hong laughed, his aura surging, an invisible domain instantly radiating from him.

"Thousand zhang... fifteen thousand zhang..." Golden light spread, enveloping four thousand zhang around Zhi Hong. It was clear he was about to break through to Immortal King Mid-Stage, reaching five thousand zhang.

"Now you're nothing to me!" Zhi Hong sneered, transforming into a golden-winged great peng, rushing toward Luo Tian with golden claws.

"Ah, you thought I hadn't ascended to Immortal King?" Luo Tian instantly understood, his eyes flashing with a smile.

"Bang..." A gray domain radiated from Luo Tian's body, roaring within it. The clash of the gray and golden domains caused a thunderous sound.

"Crack..." In an instant, the golden and gray domains collided, shattering like glass. The two domains' fragments scattered into the air.

"You..." Zhi Hong's eyes flickered with disbelief, stunned that Luo Tian had his own domain.

"How is this possible? He's not approved by the Dao, yet he still has a domain. How did he do it?" Zhi Hong's mind was in turmoil, the first time he'd seen such a situation.

His domain was nearly at Immortal King Mid-Stage strength; normally, an Immortal King Early Stage's domain would be crushed. Yet Luo Tian's domain matched his.

However, Zhi Hong had also improved significantly and was confident. His golden claws rushed toward Luo Tian.

"Fight!" Luo Tian barked, two fists appearing before him, tearing through the void and colliding with Zhi Hong's claws.

Two thunderous collisions echoed, Luo Tian retreating two steps. The great peng's image behind Zhi Hong also disintegrated, blood spewing from Zhi Hong's mouth.

"Body of an Immortal King Mid-Stage!" Zhi Hong's mind was in turmoil, his confidence crumbling before Luo Tian.

"Invincible Body!" Zhi Hong's heart trembled, transforming into a streak of light toward Luo Tian.

"The so-called Invincible Body must have limits. I believe my current body strength can match him. If not, I still have the poison needle!" Luo Tian's eyes burned with battle intent, leaping into the air toward Zhi Hong.

Boom Boom Boom...

The two fought without hesitation, their fists colliding repeatedly. The eightieth layer's space trembled with thunderous sounds, the great laws roaring. Even a true immortal peak or half-step Immortal King would be killed by their battle's aftereffects.

Both had body strength comparable to an Immortal King Mid-Stage, one invulnerable to all techniques. They fought for an hour without a victor, both spitting blood.

"If I keep fighting, I'll be at a disadvantage!" Zhi Hong thought internally. His Invincible Body had a time limit, but Luo Tian's strength was innate.

What terrified Zhi Hong most was Luo Tian's poison needle, the pain of which had nearly killed him in previous layers.

Another collision sent Zhi Hong's body flying backward, his hands moving to release thousands of hand seals.

Thousands of hand seals appeared around Zhi Hong, rushing toward Luo Tian, each carrying immense power.

"I'm not the same as before! This time I'll kill you!" Luo Tian sneered, his hands moving. A black beast roared out, swirling with winds and clouds, charging toward the hand seals.

Boom Boom...

The thunderous collisions echoed as the black beast clashed with each hand seal, shattering them.

After a hundred breaths, the black beast and the hand seals mutually annihilated.

"Buzz..." Seeing his hand seals destroyed, Zhi Hong wasn't surprised. His hands flashed with golden light, a golden staff appearing in his hand. The golden image exploded outward, pressing down on the heavens, breaking through the void toward Luo Tian.

The black sword flew from Luo Tian's hand, landing in his grasp. He swung it, the black blade forming a crescent moon, equally terrifying, colliding with the staff.

A thunderclap rose in the sky; both Luo Tian and Zhi Hong retreated simultaneously, gazing at each other.

Luo Tian leapt into the air toward Zhi Hong. He knew to kill Zhi Hong, he needed close combat, wearing down Zhi Hong's Invincible Body until its time limit expired. Then Zhi Hong would be no match for him.

"Think you're so smart!" Zhi Hong also saw Luo Tian's plan, his hands moving to release a series of martial arts.

Luo Tian wielded Longyuan Sword, continuously moving it to counter the martial arts. Though he deciphered them, they were blocked at a thousand zhang.

With thunderous sounds, Luo Tian activated his Law of the Universe, preparing to use the Seventh Step of the蛮神 (Fierce God), attempting to take his seventh step. If he could, he was confident in defeating Zhi Hong, provided Zhi Hong didn't use the Unified Qi Technique.

Luo Tian still remembered the terror of the Unified Qi Technique, even after ascending to Immortal King. He hadn't mastered it yet.

Almost instantly after forming his divine body, Luo Tian took the first step with practiced ease. His thick foot stepped on a golden hand, which震 (shook) him back.

Second step... Third step...
Luo Tian continued stepping, accumulating his aura. Soon he reached the fifth step; the distance to Zhi Hong was only a hundred zhang.

"Damn it..." Zhi Hong's face darkened, realizing Luo Tian was no longer his equal. He felt Luo Tian could suppress him.

As Zhi Hong's expression darkened, Luo Tian took the sixth step, his aura piercing the heavens. His strength was incomparable; the Fierce God's Seventh Step could annihilate an Immortal King Early Stage.

"Dragon-Subduing Palm!" Zhi Hong, sensing the intense danger at the sixth step, but unwilling to use the Unified Qi Technique unless desperate.

Chapter 2375: Capturing Zhi Hong ()

"Roar..." A golden dragon roared, Zhi Hong's body like cast bronze. A long dragon coiled around his arm, forming a totem, radiating immense pressure.

Zhi Hong's aura reached its peak, roaring as he struck with a palm. His copper-colored hand pressed down on the heavens, breaking through the void toward Luo Tian's foot.

"Boom..." A闷 (muffled) sound echoed, both their martial arts possessing immense power. The eightieth layer's space trembled.

Luo Tian and Zhi Hong both retreated, spitting blood. Luo Tian's massive divine body looked on the verge of collapse. Zhi Hong's face was pale, both gazing at each other. Luo Tian's massive body rose again.

His aura burst forth with overwhelming pressure, taking another step.

"Is this not the final move?" Zhi Hong's eyes widened with disbelief, gasping. The previous strike was also one of Zhi Hong's powerful techniques. He had seen Luo Tian's martial arts as a continuous buildup but hadn't expected it to be the final move.

Luo Tian's eyes were serious, unsure if he could take the seventh step. Not only did it require the Fierce God's Seventh Step, but also combining with the Wind-Blowing Technique. Seven times his body strength—Luo Tian couldn't imagine how strong this step would be.

An overwhelming aura radiated from Luo Tian's body, his mind recalling the scene when Lu Zhong smashed Peng Tiande's domain with a hammer. That moment had always震撼 (shaken) Luo Tian.

One... Two...
A series of leg images appeared before Luo Tian, moving at incredible speed. Even Zhi Hong couldn't discern how many leg images there were.

"Seven!"

"Fierce God's Seventh Step Annihilates the Ancient!" Luo Tian roared, his thick leg cracked with fine lines. Yet his right leg contained an earth-shattering aura, making Zhi Hong's mind tremble.

"Unified Qi Technique!" Zhi Hong's eyes flashed with madness, sensing the aura that could destroy him. He finally decided to use it.

Zhi Hong's body rapidly withered, his power still terrifying. Luo Tian's face changed but he took the seventh step anyway.

"Crash..." Gray torrents erupted from Zhi Hong's mouth, colliding with Luo Tian's seventh step.

...

The thunderous collision echoed. Next moment, the massive foot collided with the gray torrents. Luo Tian felt himself swept by a powerful冲击 (impact), like an ordinary person hit by a wave.

Too strong! Zhi Hong's previous use of the Unified Qi Technique had been weakened by Luo Tian's poison needle. Now, though not at his peak, he was much stronger than before. His strength had also improved significantly.

The gray torrents were shattered by Luo Tian's thick foot, the gray waves sweeping outward, even breaking through the heavens.

"Boom..." Luo Tian's massive body flew backward, crashing into the eightieth layer's barrier.

Cracking sounds echoed; Luo Tian's barrier behind him had cracks. Though the torrents were shattered, many still struck his divine body.

"It's over!" Zhi Hong's body became a skeleton, falling to the ground. He looked like he'd been emptied of all his strength. This attack was a last-ditch effort, draining Zhi Hong's cultivation completely.

"Kid, fighting me!" Zhi Hong's body was withered but his eyes gleamed with joy, laughing.

The gray torrents lasted half a moment before fading. Yet as they disappeared, Zhi Hong's gaunt face's smile abruptly stopped, his eyes filled with disbelief.

A hole appeared in the eightieth layer, and before it stood a figure, panting heavily. His eyes held a smile, but his body was battered, like a beggar with numerous blood holes.

"How is this possible!" Zhi Hong gasped, stunned to see Luo Tian alive after his Unified Qi Technique.

"Nothing special!" Luo Tian spoke while spitting blood, internally marveling that if his body hadn't been comparable to an Immortal King Mid-Stage, he would have died.

Even so, Luo Tian was severely wounded but in better condition than Zhi Hong.

Luo Tian's face always held a smile as he approached Zhi Hong, but this smile appeared demonic to Zhi Hong.

"What are you going to do?" Zhi Hong's eyes showed fear, his voice trembling as he struggled to stand and rush toward the eighty-first layer's exit.

"Want to run?" Luo Tian sneered, his foot moving with wind, instantly appearing at the exit. He threw a punch.

"Boom..." The punch struck Zhi Hong's position, directly hitting his withered body. His body's bones seemed completely shattered, flying a hundred zhang away from Luo Tian.

"Old monk, finally dealt with you!" Luo Tian stood before Zhi Hong, his hands moving. Demonic energy burst forth, forming demonic patterns that entered Zhi Hong's half-dead body—Dao Heart Seeding Magic.

"This..." Dao Heart Seeding Magic took effect immediately, making Zhi Hong's eyes show despair.

"What did you do to me?" Zhi Hong weakly asked, then fell unconscious.

Luo Tian stood before Zhi Hong, taking out a pill and placing it in his mouth.

"Now I can't kill him!" Luo Tian sighed, then sat cross-legged on the ground to absorb the pill's energy.

"This kid really isn't easy!" The artifact spirit, looking at the ruined eightieth layer, looked心疼 (painful), beginning to repair it.

Time passed slowly; the eightieth layer recovered in a day, but Luo Tian still kept his eyes closed. His blood holes hadn't healed yet.

After seven days, the blood holes disappeared, and Luo Tian returned to normal, slowly opening his eyes.

"Free me!" As soon as he opened his eyes, a weak voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears. He looked at Zhi Hong beside him.

Zhi Hong was still weak but no longer withered. His eyes, however, still held fear. He had recovered five percent of his strength half a month ago but found his cultivation could no longer be controlled. It was only recovering.

This half-month, Zhi Hong had tried various methods, even the completed Buddha Dharma of Mount Xumi, but could only move a little. At this rate, even millions of years would be needed to break through.

"Think you're so smart!" Luo Tian sneered, directly taking Zhi Hong and deciding not to release him. Immortal Kings held significant positions in Mount Xumi, so killing him would cause trouble. Not killing and releasing him also caused trouble. Thus, Luo Tian planned to wait until his strength was sufficient to drain Zhi Hong's cultivation.

"Eighth layer... Fire Master has reached the ninetieth!" Luo Tian's eyes glowed with a smile, stepping toward the eightieth layer's exit.

The eighty-first layer had no power to interfere, so Luo Tian faced only Immortal King Early Stage challenges. Though challenging, with his strength, he could pass through after a fierce battle.

Eighty-first layer... Eighty-second layer...
Time passed slowly; Luo Tian continued forward, his speed slow. Gradually, his cultivation stabilized, and the rewards were exceptionally rich. The resources gained from passing these layers enhanced his strength.

However, Luo Tian was now an Immortal King. Though the resources were powerful, they didn't improve his strength as rapidly as before when he was a true immortal.

After two years, Luo Tian finally broke through to the eighty-ninth layer. Fire Master had also reached the ninety-sixth. Clearly, Fire Master had improved his strength; otherwise, with his initial Immortal King Early Stage strength, he couldn't have reached the ninety-sixth.

"There's hope!" The artifact spirit sat in its space, eyes filled with admiration. This time, it focused on Fire Master.

"Unexpectedly, he's ascended to Immortal King Mid-Stage. His strength and talent are also remarkable! I was so focused on that kid, I forgot the strongest among these people!" The artifact spirit's eyes showed admiration, watching Fire Master fight against a mechanical beast.

"Still, that kid is also good, but he should stop at the eighty-ninth!" The artifact spirit thought internally, watching Luo Tian appear in the eighty-ninth layer's space.

"Again, no need for strength!" Luo Tian frowned slightly, observing the eighteen golden statues before him. He didn't rush forward, as he had experience—every ten layers had one that required no strength. He hadn't encountered these before.

Eighteen golden statues, postures varied, their appearances somewhat like the state when Zhi Hong used Dragon-Subduing Palm.

Luo Tian felt a crisis but didn't know how to pass this trial. The eighteen statues stood like lifeless figures, lifelike.

"Pass the Eighteen Golden Statues Array!" A solemn voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, not from the artifact spirit but another.

Luo Tian sighed softly, cautiously taking a small step forward. As he took this step, the golden statues' light flickered slightly.

Chapter 2376: Supplementing Heaven Stone Breaks the Array ()

Golden light rose, divine laws flowed through the eighteen statues, as if revived. As Luo Tian took a step forward, the eighteen statues attacked simultaneously, surrounding him with no gaps.

Luo Tian's eyes narrowed, sensing a massive crisis. Each of the eighteen statues' attacks could threaten an Immortal King; together, they were overwhelming, making it impossible for Luo Tian to dodge. Even with his strength and speed, he couldn't escape.

"Ten thousand souls roar," the gray Reincarnation Domain instantly enveloped him, but it had no effect on the eighteen statues. The attacks didn't weaken.

Longyuan Sword flew out, landing in Luo Tian's hand. He swung it, not to block the eighteen statues' attacks but to better observe their movements.

Collisions echoed; Luo Tian swung Longyuan Sword, colliding with six hands immediately. At the same time, his body was struck by twelve attacks, sending him flying backward and spitting blood.

"Boom..." Luo Tian fell to the ground, feeling his internal organs shifted. His eyes showed shock at the eighteen statues returning to their statue forms.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed, having been severely wounded by just one attack.

"This is too hard!" Luo Tian thought internally, watching the eighteen statues not attacking him further if he didn't cross boundaries. He sat cross-legged on the ground to recover.

"Who is the master of this tower? How could they possess such a terrifying technique!" Luo Tian cursed internally, watching the lifelike golden statues. This trial was impossible for a human to pass unless he was an Immortal King Mid-Stage, using his vast domain to fully sense the eighteen statues' attacks.

"How did Fire Master pass through?" Luo Tian wondered, unaware that Fire Master had ascended to Immortal King Mid-Stage.

"Supplementing Heaven Stone, these eighteen statues are very strong. Can you smash them?" Luo Tian consulted with Supplementing Heaven Stone, having consumed so much resources before. He guessed Supplementing Heaven Stone's strength had also improved significantly.
