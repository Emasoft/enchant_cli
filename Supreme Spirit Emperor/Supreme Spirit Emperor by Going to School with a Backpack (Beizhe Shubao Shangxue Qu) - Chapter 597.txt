Luotian's eyes swept around, trying to see if Zhang Ziping and the others were here, but he couldn't find their figures. However, Luotian spotted a familiar figure among the crowd — the former commander of Bountiful Heaven City.

"Luotian!" Xue Zilong, dressed in a purple robe, stood there with an expression of resentment. If it weren't for Luotian, he could have stayed in Bountiful Heaven City for a long time, relying on accumulated battle merits to become one of the core elders of Bountiful Heaven City, like Zhang Ziping and Tianfu.

"Interesting!" Luotian's eyes showed amusement as he glanced at Xue Zilong, then stopped paying attention to him. At this moment, Xue Zilong was nothing to him.

"Are you all ready?" Just as people were discussing, a playful voice echoed in their ears. A wave of wine scent rushed into their noses.

Figures appeared in the sky, with a man dressed in white clothes and looking disheveled at the front. He carried a long sword on his back and held a gourd of wine in his hand — it was Jiang Taibai, the Wine Sword Immortal who had once met Luotian.

"Master has entered the realm of Immortal King!" Luotian sensed Jiang Taibai's aura and his eyes flickered slightly. He hadn't expected Jiang Taibai's cultivation speed to be so fast. When he had seen Jiang Taibai before, he was at the peak of True Immortal. How many years had passed since then, and yet Jiang Taibai had already entered the Immortal King realm.

Standing beside Jiang Taibai were figures with powerful auras, each radiating an iron-blooded aura.

"Senior Brother!" Luotian saw a familiar face beside Jiang Taibai — Zhang Ziping, Lei Yong, Ji Chen, and Tianfu. There were nine people in total — five at the threshold of Immortal King and three at the peak of True Immortal.

"Respect your Uncle!" Jiang Yuzhe and the others bowed to Jiang Taibai, showing respect in their eyes.

"This is Master Jiang Taibai, the Wine Sword Immortal who ranks second only to Bountiful Heaven King in Bountiful Heaven Mountain. He is the youngest brother of Bountiful Heaven King!"

"He's not only powerful but also oversees our Bountiful Heaven Mountain's Enforcement Hall. The Enforcement Hall is composed of hardened individuals who have retired from Bountiful Heaven City. For instance, Zhang Ziping, who recently retired, was extremely strong!"

The disciples of Bountiful Heaven Mountain also bowed to Jiang Taibai with respect on their faces.

"Senior Brother has reached the threshold of Immortal King and is also following Master Jiang Taibai. Lei Yong and Ji Chen have reached the peak of True Immortal. It seems their journey to Bountiful Heaven Mountain was not in vain!" Luotian smiled, looking at Zhang Ziping standing beside Jiang Taibai.

"Get up!" Jiang Taibai took a sip of wine and didn't pay much attention. His eyes scanned over the crowd, and when he saw Luotian, a slight smile appeared in his eyes.

"You're quite good!" Jiang Taibai clearly hadn't forgotten Luotian, for there was no one who had drunk all his wine over the years.

"Master's kindness is unforgettable!" Luotian quickly bowed and directly established a relationship with him.

"Is this person familiar with Uncle Six?" Jiang Yulong and others furrowed their brows, looking at Luotian with different expressions.

"Master, this is the gourd you gave me before. It's a small token of my respect; please accept it!" Luotian took out the gourd he had received from Jiang Taibai and handed it to him.

"He actually has Uncle Six's wine gourd!" Seeing Luotian's action, Jiang Yulong and others' faces changed even more.

Jiang Taibai had no children, and Bountiful Heaven King had six brothers. Jiang Taibai was the youngest one, so Bountiful Heaven King loved him very much. His other brothers also loved Jiang Taibai greatly, and Jiang Taibai could completely influence Bountiful Heaven King's thoughts. They had previously tried to flatter Jiang Taibai, but the results were not very good.

"Oh?" Jiang Taibai's face showed interest. He took the wine gourd and opened it, then his eyes slightly narrowed.

"Interesting!" Jiang Taibai chuckled lightly, took a sip and then closed the gourd before returning it to Luotian.

"It's an excellent item, but it's not as good as my wine!" Jiang Taibai chuckled lightly, and a misty aura spread from his body.

"Has the wine scent in Uncle Six's body been purified?" People watching the white mist looked surprised.

"Alright, I've drunk this. I won't thank you, but now you boys need to prepare yourselves — try not to kill anyone if possible!" Jiang Taibai spoke to the group.

"Respect Uncle Six's teachings!" Jiang Yulong and others didn't know what to think, but they showed respect on the surface.

"Buzz..." Jiang Yulong pulled out a long sword from his back and spat out a mouthful of wine. The sword's aura flickered.

The long sword easily pierced through the sky, revealing a series of gray mist. Jiang Yulong spoke: "Enter! Once you enter, you will know how to pass the test. The one who passes the test first will be the Young Master of Bountiful Heaven Mountain and the next master!"

"Yes!" Jiang Yuzhe and others quickly bowed, then looked excitedly at the gray crack. They flew into it.

Jiang Yuzhe took flight, leading Luotian and others toward the crack in space. In a moment, they reached the edge of the gray spatial rift. Luotian felt some hesitation; he had some trauma regarding places like this.

"Go on!" Jiang Yuzhe chuckled and rushed into the spatial rift. Luotian and his three companions sighed and followed Jiang Yuzhe in.

"Buzz..." A moment later, waves of energy affected Luotian and others' bodies. The surrounding scenery changed.

A gray starry sky appeared in the view of Luotian and others, making him feel nostalgic.

The vast starry sky was boundless, with stars emitting radiant light and floating in the sky.

"What is this..." Jiang Yuzhe, Jiang Huantian, and Si Ma Feiying's faces showed shock as they looked at the vast starry sky.

They were born in the Immortal Realm and had never left it. They had never seen what was beyond the domain, only learned about it from records.

"This is the Immortal Ruins — a broken small world!" Jiang Yuzhe's eyes showed shock as he looked at the vast starry sky and spoke to Luotian and others.

"Immortal Ruins?" Luotian's face showed admiration as he looked at the vast starry sky, feeling a sense of comfort.

The atmosphere here was similar to the Nine Domains but not quite. The vitality was much less, and Luotian could only sense a small amount of life.

"I feel so strong now. I can easily destroy stars!" Si Ma Feiying's face showed shock as he looked at the vast starry sky, feeling that the rules here were unusually weak. With just a thought, they could destroy those vast stars.

"The key is what we are doing here? What test is this?" Si Ma Feiying asked, looking puzzled.

"This small world was created suddenly during the battle between two sects when an enemy attacked Bountiful Heaven Mountain. No one expected this small world to appear!"

"It was also the battle between two sects that caused this small world to suffer a catastrophe. The highest cultivation in this small world was only the Daoist Realm, which could not withstand attacks from Immortal Kings or True Immortals. Even the attacks of the Daoist Realm could not be endured, so this world was completely destroyed!"

"Finally, Bountiful Heaven Mountain defeated the attacking sect. However, this small world was also affected. The millions of lives in this world were annihilated, leaving only a small number of people."

"My father felt compassion for the bloodstained starry domain and, with his strength, stabilized this starry domain to preserve its lives so they could live on their own."

"However, the inhabitants of this world have developed hatred for Bountiful Heaven Mountain and want to take revenge!"

"I think the test my father set is for us to subdue these people!" Jiang Yuzhe's eyes showed contemplation as he looked at the various continents.

"Let's go. This place is indeed fair, since none of us have been here before and it's a test of our abilities. I understand it this way!" Jiang Yuzhe's eyes showed a slight smile.

"How to subdue them?" Luotian muttered quietly, his eyes showing compassion as he looked at this broken small world. He thought of the Nine Domains; if they had encountered the Immortal Realm, would the Nine Domains also be like this?

"There are several thousand continents here. I don't know how many people there are, but we can go one by one and have the native residents submit to us. I estimate it's about who subdues more continents among our nine brothers!" Jiang Yuzhe spoke, then flew into the sky toward a nearby continent. Jiang Yulong and Jiang Yufeng also rushed towards different continents. People's personalities were different, so their methods of subduing would naturally be different. The only common feature was that these people were extremely powerful.

"Buzz..." Luotian and others tore through the void, appearing under the sky. As they appeared, people on the continent were shaken.

"Who are you?" A figure flew up from the ground with a serious expression, emitting an aura of True Immortal Initial Stage. He looked at Luotian and others.

Chapter 2262: Starry Domain

Figures rose into the sky, cautiously watching Luotian and his three companions. They adopted a defensive posture, but Luotian saw hatred in their eyes.

"Are you the leader of this continent? We are here to take you out!" Si Ma Feiying shouted, looking down on a True Immortal Initial Stage.

"Is there a True Immortal Initial Stage? Is it because of the connection with the Immortal Realm?" Luotian was puzzled. According to logic, a True Immortal Initial Stage should not exist in the three thousand small worlds.

A True Immortal Initial Stage could easily sweep through the Nine Domains. It was a being beyond the Epoch Lord, and if Luotian returned to the Nine Domains now, he would be an overpowered force. Even if all people of the Nine Domains joined together, they wouldn't be his match. But now there was a True Immortal Stage in this continent — it clearly broke free from the rules of the three thousand small worlds.

"Feiying, be polite!" Jiang Yuzhe spoke with a smile: "Friend, I know you hate us. But do you really want to stay in this small world and not go see the Immortal Realm?"

"Impossible! To subdue us, you must kill us. If it weren't for you, our Starry Domain would not have become like this!" An old man spoke. Although he was at the True Immortal Middle Stage, his aura was extremely strong.

That battle had been like an apocalypse for them. Many people died, and they didn't even know how they died — they were killed by the aftermath of the battle between two sects.

Later, they discovered the truth and were surprised to find that they could continue to progress. The rules of Starry Domain had changed.

Hatred was all they felt, and they wanted to quietly cultivate until they were strong enough to break out of Starry Domain and attack the Immortal Realm.

Luotian looked at these people with hatred in their eyes, feeling they were pitiable. If they knew the strength of Bountiful Heaven Mountain, even if they broke out of this small world, they would never be able to take revenge. He wondered what kind of despair these people would feel.

"Everyone, I know you hate us very much. But we were also unintentional in those events!" Jiang Yuzhe spoke, his eyes showing regret.

"Die without submission! We are no longer the small people you could mold at will. Now our Starry Domain is also extremely strong. You are powerful, but we are definitely not your match. However, we still have our Domain Lord. He has reached the level of creation and will definitely destroy you!" The old man spoke, then flew up toward Luotian and others.

"Kill them all!" Tens of thousands of figures flew up, radiating waves of divine light. Their eyes showed determination and a series of martial arts techniques were thrown toward Luotian and others.

The sky collapsed, the entire continent trembled. Waves of martial arts techniques surged with overwhelming power. Jiang Yuzhe, Jiang Huantian and Si Ma Feiying were shocked — they had never seen an entire continent tremble before.

Compared to the three of them, this feeling was very familiar to Luotian. As he watched the waves of martial arts techniques rushing toward him, he extended his hand.

"Boom..." The thunderous sound echoed through the sky. A True Immortal Middle Stage, a True Immortal Initial Stage and a group of Daoist Realm people were like ants before Luotian.

A black hand burst forth, colliding with the countless martial arts techniques. The entire continent trembled violently, and winds reversed. With one palm strike, he scattered tens of thousands of martial arts techniques.

"So strong?" Seeing Luotian's power, Jiang Yuzhe and others were stunned.

"You can do it too..." Luotian chuckled lightly, his aura of True Immortal Late Stage radiating. The overwhelming pressure spread in all directions.

Luotian had once been the Epoch Lord, and his control over pressure was definitely beyond anyone in this world. The pressure spread out, instantly stopping those people's movements and making them look at Luotian with fear. Jiang Yuzhe and others also looked at the powerful aura on Luotian with shock.

"Indeed, we are strong in these three thousand small worlds!" Jiang Huantian's face changed. He looked at the trembling people and the collapsing sky, feeling admiration.

"Are you willing to submit or not?" Si Ma Feiying shouted loudly. His aura was also powerful, though not as much as Luotian's — he was like a ruler.

"Feiying, don't be so harsh. We are not here to kill!" Jiang Yuzhe spoke, looking at the native people.

The old man's face was pale. He looked at Luotian and couldn't believe that they were so strong. People who had accidentally entered this place before had no strength like Luotian and his companions — one palm strike was enough to scatter all their attacks.

"It's impossible to submit. We only serve the Domain Lord!" The old man spoke, his voice resolute as he stared at Luotian and others. This continent was just a small part of Starry Domain, with only tens of thousands of people.

"Domain Lord of Starry Domain?" Jiang Yuzhe felt a headache. Subduing these people was harder than killing them. Moreover, they had no grudge with them. Killing them would be hard to justify. Jiang Yuzhe also guessed that his father's intention was not simply to kill them.

"The key is the Domain Lord of Starry Domain!" Luotian frowned slightly and spoke quietly. If they could subdue the Domain Lord of Starry Domain, then naturally the entire Starry Domain would be under their control.

At the same time, Jiang Yuzhe's other brothers also found a continent each and started trying to subdue it. Some people didn't choose to subdue but instead began exploring Starry Domain, since traversing the stars was not something everyone could do. Although this starry domain wasn't outside the Immortal Realm, it was still a part of the three thousand small worlds. Anyway, they had no intention of competing for the Young Master position.

"This place is indeed an Immortal Ruins, but there are also many opportunities. After the sect that attacked Bountiful Heaven Mountain failed, they left behind a lot of inheritance. We can also go and search for it!" A young man smiled, speaking to those who followed him.

"They said Bountiful Heaven Mountain has an Immortal Ruins with countless opportunities. This time, we've benefited from the Sixth Prince!" These people spoke happily and roamed through the vast starry domain.

Those who wanted to compete for the Young Master position — Jiang Yulong, Jiang Yufeng and Jiang Yu — started using their methods to subdue the people in this starry domain. However, their methods were not as gentle as Jiang Yuzhe's. Some directly launched bloody massacres and suppression, while others imposed restrictions.

In a short time, Starry Domain began to become chaotic. The appearance of these people caused the entire Starry Domain to tremble.

But it was only a day of chaos. On the second day after their appearance, Starry Domain responded — strong figures from each continent rushed toward the central part of Starry Domain because that was where the strongest being, the Domain Lord of Starry Domain, resided.

Luotian and his companions didn't stay on the previous continent but pushed their entire continent toward the central part of Starry Domain.

The people on the continent were trembling, not knowing what these powerful figures wanted to do. Although they were loyal to the Domain Lord of Starry Domain and hated Jiang Yuzhe's group, it didn't mean they weren't afraid of death.

"Let me go!" As the four figures pushed their massive continent toward the central part of Starry Domain, a furious voice echoed from the sky.

Four figures appeared under the starry sky. They radiated an icy aura and looked at the drifting continent.

"Nine Brother! Come out for a meeting!" A soft voice echoed. Jiang Yufeng smiled, looking at Luotian and others standing on the continent through the sky.

"Two Brother!" Jiang Yuzhe's face darkened, facing Jiang Yufeng across the sky. Then he spoke to Luotian and others: "This is my Second Brother, Jiang Yufeng. The half-step Immortal King behind him is a senior elder of Bountiful Heaven Mountain, named Jiang Cheng. As for the two young men, they are disciples of two sects in Central Heaven — both ranked among the top ten sects.

"The elder who transported you is also connected with him. You didn't arrive through the transport, so I suspect he was involved!" Jiang Yuzhe spoke to Luotian and others, making their faces turn grim.

"Such a sissy?" The three of them flashed cold glares, recalling the situation in the Dead Sea. If it weren't for Luotian awakening Xiang Tianming, they would have been buried in the Dead Sea by now.

"I really want to kill him, but I'm afraid his father won't let me!" Luotian muttered in his heart. He followed Jiang Yuzhe and stepped out of the continent, standing under the starry sky.

"Nine Brother, let me take this continent!" Jiang Yuzhe spoke directly to Jiang Yuzhe, asking for their continent. This was common in the past.

"Don't give it!" Jiang Yuzhe coldly replied. Now, Jiang Yuzhe was not the same as before. Previously, he had to yield because of his health issues, but now that Jiang Yuzhe was not at the same level as Jiang Yufeng, he wasn't the person who could be bullied anymore.

"Then I'll have to do it myself!" Jiang Yufeng saw the look in Jiang Yuzhe's eyes and his own eyes flashed with fierce intent. Without hesitation, he stepped into the starry sky and rushed toward Jiang Yuzhe.

"Damn it! Sissy, you're even stealing without a reason!" Jiang Yuzhe hadn't moved yet, but Luotian shouted and rushed toward Jiang Yufeng. Although he couldn't kill Jiang Yufeng, he could at least beat him up and make him unable to live normally.

"Die!" Jiang Yufeng was furious, looking at Luotian rushing toward him. His white fist shot out and struck Luotian.

One punch seemed to shatter the starry sky, with overwhelming power. Jiang Yuzhe's face slightly changed — he didn't know Luotian's current strength, whether it was a match for Jiang Yufeng.

Chapter 2263: Battle Against Jiang Yufeng

Under the starry sky, two streaks of light rushed toward each other. In an instant, they collided and lightning surged under the starry sky, with collision sounds echoing through it.

"Boom..." Almost immediately after the collision, both Luotian and Jiang Yufeng's bodies retreated. Luotian steadied himself, the starry sky distorted, and he looked at Jiang Yufeng standing opposite him.

"Unexpectedly, you sissy looks weak but your body is strong!" Luotian chuckled and shook his numb fist. He stepped into the starry sky again, rushing toward Jiang Yufeng.

"Who are you calling a sissy!" Jiang Yufeng roared, showing no fear and rushing toward Luotian.

Jiang Yufeng was the son of Bountiful Heaven King. His strength was naturally formidable. Luotian's current strength was at the True Immortal Late Stage, one level lower than Jiang Yufeng. After their second collision, they fought back and forth continuously.

"Master doesn't need to worry; Luotian's strength is something I also fear. It's far more than what you see!" Jiang Huantian spoke to Jiang Yuzhe, recounting the event where Luotian had defeated Jiang Wuxin.

"Si Ma Feiying, come on. Everyone has their own master; I hope you won't disappoint me!" A young man stepped forward, looking at Si Ma Feiying with a glimmer of battle in his eyes. This was not only a battlefield for Jiang Yuzhe and others but also for these disciples of sects. They were all top-tier talents, naturally not willing to back down.

"Yang Chenyu, I also have this intention!" Si Ma Feiying sneered and rushed toward the young man.

"Jiang Huantian, it seems you're going to hang on to Nine Brother's tree!" A senior sighed and looked at Jiang Huantian with coldness.

There was a special family within Bountiful Heaven Mountain — the Jiang Family. The Jiang Family did not belong to the structure of Bountiful Heaven Mountain but was a steward for the Jiang family, like an internal official. They didn't participate in major or minor affairs of Bountiful Heaven Mountain but managed the vast Jiang family.

Therefore, the Jiang Family had a very powerful influence within Bountiful Heaven Mountain. Even the elders would give respect to the Jiang family's old ancestor, and the old ancestor of the Jiang Family held an important position in Bountiful Heaven Hall.

"Ah!" Jiang Huantian nodded and bowed to the elder. The elder was his senior, although their relationship wasn't very close, they both shared the same surname.

"Alright, then let's finish you here!" The elder chuckled and his aura surged. He moved swiftly toward Jiang Huantian. Meanwhile, Jiang Yuzhe faced off against another of Jiang Yufeng's companions. In an instant, the starry sky began to tremble and that continent was pushed far away to avoid being affected.

The starry sky exploded, with large cracks appearing as if it had fallen into an apocalypse. Stars without people were destroyed by the collision between them.

"Too powerful! Only the Domain Lord of Starry Domain could be their match. Let's take this opportunity and leave quickly!" The people on the continent looked at the eight-person battlefield with fear, their bodies trembling uncontrollably.

In an instant, the entire continent drifted toward the central part of Starry Domain.

Jiang Yufeng swung his fist with one hand and used the other to form seals, leaving divine laws engraved on his arms. His white fist radiated a shocking wave.

"Ah?" Luotian's eyes flickered slightly. He felt a sense of danger on Jiang Yufeng's fist and immediately took it seriously, but it was too late to think. He unleashed the chaotic wind fists, and two fist images merged together, colliding with Jiang Yufeng's fist.

"Crack..." The starry sky trembled. This time, Luotian's body was pushed back, and Jiang Yufeng took a few steps back. His eyes showed contempt.

"Did you think that because of your strength in the Starry River Palace, you could do whatever you wanted in the Upper Heaven? This is the Upper Heaven, not your Central Heaven!" Jiang Yufeng spoke coldly and moved again toward Luotian. He appeared in front of Luotian's body, and his white fist struck toward Luotian again.

One punch pierced the starry sky. Compared to the previous one, it was even more powerful — obviously enhanced by a secret technique.

"Don't talk to me. I have a cleanliness obsession!" Luotian coldly replied and struck with one fist. This time, four images of fists merged together, giving four times the strength of his body — enough to shatter this continent.

"Damn it! He didn't use all his strength!" Jiang Yufeng's face changed, but he couldn't change it now.

"Crack..." A dull sound echoed. Jiang Yufeng's face, which had already been pale, became even paler. He felt as if he had hit an iron plate and his arm was about to explode.

His body rolled back, colliding with a star that spanned ten thousand feet. Dust enveloped Jiang Yufeng.

"Will this place regenerate limbs and blood?" Luotian's eyebrows slightly furrowed, thinking of a possibility. He stopped his body and activated the Yellow Spring Step, disappearing from the spot.

Jiang Yufeng emerged from the dust with a look of joy. He could clearly feel that his arm was about to break and had spilled out a lot of blood, but it had almost immediately recovered.

"Does this place have no death?" Jiang Yufeng's heart was surprised. As he thought, Luotian's figure had already arrived, and a series of explosion sounds echoed in Jiang Yufeng's ears. His face changed again.

"Get out!" However, Jiang Yufeng was no ordinary person and reacted quickly. He formed a seal with one hand and struck with the other, rushing toward Luotian.

"Boom..." This time, Jiang Yufeng's arm exploded and turned into a mist of blood that scattered under the starry sky. His body was pushed back again, but on the other side, a gray seal fell from the sky and struck Luotian fiercely.

Luotian extended his hand, and a black ghost claw emerged from the starry sky. A roaring sound echoed as a black ghost claw rushed toward the gray seal.

"Boom..." The thunderous sound was overwhelming. Black starry sky began to explode, and the black ghost claw collided with the gray seal, creating a violent gust of wind that swept across the starry sky.

Jiang Yufeng's body was pushed back again, but his face showed joy. He saw that his arm had grown back.

"In this place, we are all immortal!" Jiang Yufeng spoke and looked at Luotian.

"Idiot!" Luotian muttered in his heart, but he was also quite surprised. He had an idea.

"Subdue this guy to the Daoist Realm!" Luotian thought. Jiang Yufeng didn't know, but he did. If one died, the cultivation would drop by a level.

"Manifesting the Daoist Body!" As he thought, Luotian activated his divine body. With a thunderous sound, his body suddenly expanded — not ten thousand feet this time but ten thousand feet.

"This..." Seeing Luotian's body like a mountain, Jiang Yufeng's face turned grim.

"Boom..." A black foot stepped down, as if crushing the heavens. It instantly landed on Jiang Yufeng's head.

"Bountiful Heaven!" Jiang Yufeng roared and raised his hands to the sky, meeting Luotian's crushing foot.

"Boom..." Jiang Yufeng's body crashed down. Stars were destroyed by the collision with Jiang Yufeng.

"Buzz..." However, even though Jiang Yufeng was passive, his body emitted waves of energy. A surge of gray mist flowed out and covered Jiang Yufeng's body, roaring with power and forming a tall figure like an actual being.

As the gray shadow surrounding Jiang Yufeng solidified, Luotian's second foot strike also fell. Two images of feet merged and pressed down on Jiang Yufeng.

Jiang Yufeng's face showed a cold smile. The gray figure struck with one fist, colliding with Luotian's second foot strike.

"Boom..." Two massive bodies retreated. Luotian showed surprise, looking at the gray misty figure.

"Buzz..." As Luotian was surprised, the gray shadow moved. It extended its hand and a gray spear appeared in the hands of the gray figure, which was thrown toward Luotian.

The starry sky began to collapse. The gray spear pierced through the stars and instantly appeared in front of Luotian.

"This is a martial art passed down by my father! The Void Spear!" Jiang Yufeng's eyes showed a slight smile, waiting for Luotian to be pierced.

"Eight Directions of Treasure Retrieval!" Luotian didn't continue with his third foot strike but instead extended his hand. An invisible wave spread from Luotian's hands. With a thunderous sound, the gray spear changed direction and flew past Luotian's face, piercing into the starry sky.

"Buzz..." The Dragon Spring Sword emitted a series of buzzes and suddenly expanded, landing in Luotian's hand. He slashed with one sword, sending a black blade into the starry sky.

"Did you think escaping was over?" Jiang Yufeng's eyes were serious, but he smiled coldly. He clenched his fist and pulled it back.

"Pu..." Luotian's ears only heard the sound of piercing through space. A strong sense of danger invaded his mind.

In a life-or-death situation, Luotian suddenly twisted his body. The gray spear appeared behind him and pierced into Luotian's shoulder. Blood spurted out, forming a river of blood that fell from the starry sky. Jiang Yufeng also had a gray sword in his hand, which Luotian had seen before. It was the Bountiful Heaven Sword that required one hundred million battle merits to exchange in Bountiful Heaven City. However, this Bountiful Heaven Sword was more powerful than the one Luotian had seen in Bountiful Heaven City, and it wasn't affected by Luotian's Dragon Spring Sword.

"Buzz..." The Bountiful Heaven Sword emitted a series of gray light. The gray sword's aura carried an unusual fluctuation, making Luotian frown slightly.

"Second level of Sword Dao?" Luotian spoke quietly, moving his Dragon Spring Sword and striking with one sword. He also used the second level of Sword Dao, sending a black blade out that collided with the gray sword's aura.

They both retreated again. Jiang Yufeng looked at Luotian's Dragon Spring Sword and knew the power of his Bountiful Heaven Sword. He was using the second level of Sword Dao.

Chapter 2264: You Won't Die

In the dark starry sky, the stars continued to shake and break. Eight figures collided with each other constantly. Among the eight people, there were wins and losses. Si Ma Feiying and Jiang Huantian fell into a disadvantage, while Luotian and Jiang Yuzhe had the upper hand.

"How strong he is! Among these four people of Jiang Yuzhe, besides the half-step Immortal King Jiang Huantian, this Luotian is the strongest!" Jiang Yufeng spat blood and his body shattered stars. He looked at the massive figure rushing toward him.

"Boom..." Three images of legs merged and landed on Jiang Yufeng's gray figure, producing a crackling sound. An invisible wave pushed for tens of thousands of miles. Around them, there was a vacuum.

"Boom..." A large amount of gray mist flowed out from the gray figure, and Jiang Yufeng spat a large amount of blood again.

"This can still withstand it?" Luotian frowned slightly, looking at Jiang Yufeng who was still spitting blood. Jiang Yufeng's strength had exceeded Luotian's expectations.

Generally, a True Immortal Peak would be crushed by Luotian. However, this Jiang Yufeng had used most of his techniques and still couldn't subdue him.

"Get out!" Jiang Yufeng's eyes showed madness. He formed seals with his hands and emitted a surge of gray mist, sending out a massive creature from in front of him.

"Roar..." A gray tiger roared and did not rush toward Luotian but flew around him.

"One... two..." Five gray tigers flew out, surrounding Luotian and rotating around him.

Luotian's eyes flickered slightly but didn't attack immediately. He held the Dragon Spring Sword and looked at Jiang Yufeng standing in the gray figure.

Hand seals turned, and Jiang Yufeng also looked at Luotian. An invisible wave flew out from his hands, and in an instant, it rushed toward Luotian.

"Roar..." As Jiang Yufeng grabbed, the five gray tigers roared and rushed toward five directions.

"Break..."

As Luotian was confused, his body suddenly trembled. His hands and feet, as well as his head, seemed to be tied by five ropes, pulling him and making him instantly immobilized.

"Five Tigers Pulling the Corpse!" Jiang Yufeng smiled, showing confidence on his face.

"You're doomed. No one has ever been able to break this technique!" Jiang Yufeng laughed and stood under the starry sky, shouting at Luotian.

"Crack..." At this moment, a sound of cracking echoed from Luotian's body. The five tigers continuously kicked their legs and ran away.

"Ah..." Luotian roared, trying to break free from the invisible restraint but was tightly bound.

"How is it? Is it uncomfortable? This Five Tigers Pulling the Corpse technique has no solution. Unless it's in the Immortal King Realm!" Jiang Yufeng laughed coldly and flew up, his Bountiful Heaven Sword radiating power. He rushed toward Luotian's heart.

"Human-Heaven Dao Method!" Luotian formed seals with his hands. Within a hundred feet, the Human-Heaven Dao Method enveloped him. The five gray tigers suddenly stopped.

"Buzz..." In a flash, Jiang Yufeng's Bountiful Heaven Sword also reached Luotian's chest. Just as it was about to pierce into Luotian's heart, the sword stopped.

A large hand grabbed the golden sword, and blood stained its blade.

"You're too early to be happy!" Luotian sneered and struck with one fist, sending a thick fist toward Jiang Yufeng.

"Roar..." The five tigers struggled and pulled, but they couldn't stop Luotian's actions. A heavy fist with the chaotic wind technique struck Jiang Yufeng.

"Boom..." The collision sound echoed. Jiang Yufeng spat blood and his gray figure finally disintegrated. At the same time, the five gray tigers also shattered and turned into a swirling mass of gray mist. The starry sky collapsed, and the gray mist rushed into the void.

"What's going on?" Jiang Yufeng's face was grim. He looked at Luotian walking toward him and felt that Luotian's aura had suddenly increased.

Thunder echoed, and Luotian's black foot stepped again, pressing down on Jiang Yufeng's pale body.

"Crack..." This time, Jiang Yufeng was severely injured. His slender body had cracks everywhere and looked like it would break.

"Buzz..." Luotian's body also shrank back to its normal size. He flew up and disappeared from the spot. In an instant, Luotian was standing in front of Jiang Yufeng who was flying back. He struck again with one fist, hitting Jiang Yufeng's shoulder.

One punch... two punches... Luotian kept throwing punches, and a dense array of fist images appeared in front of Jiang Yufeng. With the thunderous sound, Jiang Yufeng finally couldn't withstand it.
