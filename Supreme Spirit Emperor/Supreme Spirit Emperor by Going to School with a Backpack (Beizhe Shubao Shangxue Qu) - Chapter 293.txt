But soon after, Chu Chen found himself in a tragic situation. Although he had blocked the giant ape's fist, another furious purple lightning bird remained. Purple flames spread across the sky, engulfing Chu Chen completely.

"Primordial Flame!" Chu Chen's face suddenly changed, but he was already surrounded by the violet flames. The terrifying heat enveloped his body, causing his massive form to turn crimson instantly.

"Brother, you go first. I'll hold them off!" Chu Chen shouted at Luo Tian, signaling him to flee.

"Want to run? It's not that easy!" The giant ape and the purple lightning bird finally noticed Luo Tian. Their eyes showed a hint of confusion, but due to their beastly instincts, they sensed an overwhelming pressure from Luo Tian's bloodline.

"Never mind! Step on him!" The giant ape, though briefly puzzled, extended his massive foot and stomped toward Luo Tian.

"Be careful!" Chu Chen wanted to rescue him, but was entangled by the purple lightning bird's flames and couldn't break free.

"Brother, do it like before!" Chu Chen shouted, continuously smashing purple dragon-like flames while shouting at Luo Tian.

No need for Chu Chen to say it. Luo Tian had already gathered all his strength, swinging his fist toward the giant foot that looked like a mountain.

"Boom..." The golden foot was far larger than Luo Tian's fist. In the line of sight, Luo Tian's small figure was instantly crushed under the foot.

The giant ape wore a triumphant expression. He loved the feeling of crushing others. In this South Ridge, he had crushed countless beasts.

However, soon after, the giant ape's golden face trembled. A look of terror appeared on his face as an irresistible force rose beneath him, gradually spreading throughout his entire body.

Blood splattered everywhere. In the next moment, the giant ape's massive body exploded into a mist of blood, scattering onto the ground.

"What!" Chu Chen and the purple lightning bird were stunned. They stared at Luo Tian, drenched in blood, still holding his fist in position, standing there. Chu Chen could hardly speak.

"Luo... Brother Luo! Did you kill that guy with one punch?" Chu Chen spoke softly, his voice filled with disbelief.

"Yeah, I felt like I could beat him. I didn't expect it to actually work!" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, looking at the blood covering his body. It was thick and uncomfortable.

"That was too strong!" Chu Chen's heart trembled. He knew the giant ape's strength. Even he would have to prepare for a fierce battle against it. But Luo Tian had simply punched and killed it instantly, which was beyond Chu Chen's expectations.

"Luo... Brother Luo, what level are you?" Chu Chen asked softly, his voice filled with anticipation. He thought of some great masters who sometimes chose to live in seclusion. Perhaps Luo Tian was one such master, choosing to live among their stone village.

Chu Chen's simple mind kept thinking and gradually believed it. His gaze toward Luo Tian changed, showing a hint of tension.

The purple lightning bird cried again, its eyes now trembling as it looked at Luo Tian. Then it let out a mournful cry and stopped fighting. It opened its mouth, drawing back the purple flames around Chu Chen. Its eyes gazed at the place where Luo Tian had crushed it, shedding two drops of purple tears.

"Chirp... chirp..." Two weak cries made the purple lightning bird tremble. Its violet eyes flashed with hope, and its sharp claws dug into the ground.

Luo Tian, covered in blood, watched the purple lightning bird. He feared it might go mad again and attack him fiercely, clenching his fists tightly.

But after a short while, Luo Tian and Chu Chen relaxed. The purple lightning bird had in its mouth two tiny purple chicks, appearing before Luo Tian and Chu Chen's eyes.

"Gurgle..." The purple lightning bird showed a look of entreaty in its violet eyes, gazing at Luo Tian and placing the two chicks before him.

"Huh?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, but then understood the purple lightning bird's intention.

In front of him, the two chicks lay on the ground, barely alive. Their eyes were still closed.

"Please... give me a drop of your blood! Save my children!" The purple lightning bird's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, startling him.

"My blood?" Luo Tian pointed at himself, confused about what the bird meant.

"Yes, your blood!" The purple lightning bird's face showed entreaty as it bowed before Luo Tian, its violet eyes gazing at him.

"Why do you know your blood can save your children?" Luo Tian asked, puzzled.

"Because you are a Sage Stage powerhouse. Sage Stage individuals can regenerate through blood. Your blood naturally can save lives, and I also sensed the aura of the Dragon Clan on you!" The purple lightning bird looked puzzled. It couldn't understand why this human was so powerful yet asked such a question.

"Sage Stage?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He had heard Chu Chen mention the cultivation levels before, but he hadn't paid much attention. Now, hearing the bird call him a Sage Stage, he felt confused.

"Why are you here and living with the barbarians?" Before Luo Tian could ask further, the purple lightning bird's voice echoed again in his mind, startling him.

"Where should I be?" Luo Tian asked, looking at the bird with confusion, not knowing what it meant.

"You are a human. Why are you living with the barbarians? It seems you get along quite well!" The purple lightning bird explained to Luo Tian.

"Human?" Luo Tian looked at his body. Compared to Chu Chen, he was vastly different. But he couldn't remember anything. Even his name "Luo Tian" had just come back to him. How could he know anything else?

"Please save my children!" The purple lightning bird didn't continue speaking but gazed at the two barely alive chicks on the ground. At this moment, only a Sage's blood could possibly save its two children.

"Okay!" Luo Tian had many questions for the purple lightning bird. Without hesitation, he used Chu Chen's bone spear to cut his wrist, spilling two golden blood jets.

"Roar..." At the moment the two blood jets shot out, a series of dragon roars rose from the golden blood. The powerful pressure made Chu Chen's face change.

Chu Chen's own bloodline was astonishing, but at the moment the two blood jets appeared, he felt his entire body boiling.

The purple lightning bird was even more overwhelmed. It lay on the ground, trembling, but its eyes showed intense excitement.

Under the purple lightning bird's expectant gaze, Luo Tian's blood fell onto the two chicks, merging into their bodies.

"Boom... boom..." In the next moment, a series of rumbles echoed from the tiny bodies of the two chicks. Their previously bald feathers began to grow slowly, and their tightly closed eyes gradually opened. Faintly, golden lightning could be seen flashing in their eyes.

Golden light spread everywhere. Unlike the purple feathers of the purple lightning bird, after growing purple feathers, the two chicks gradually transformed into golden yellow.

"Bloodline has improved!" The purple lightning bird's eyes showed excitement as it gazed at Luo Tian, showing gratitude.

"Chirp... chirp..." The two small purple lightning birds slowly stood up, their bodies glowing with golden light. They clumsily approached the purple lightning bird and rubbed against it.

The purple lightning bird's massive eyes showed gratitude. It couldn't believe that this incident had turned into a blessing, allowing its two chicks to not only survive but also significantly enhance their bloodline.

"This barbarian continent mainly survives the barbarians, those giants by your side. You are a human, and not of the same race as the ancient giants. Perhaps this South Ridge is isolated, so the barbarians don't know about humans!" The purple lightning bird seemed to sense what had changed in Luo Tian, and began explaining in detail.

"I once flew to the center of the barbarian continent, the Yanhuang City. That's where the core of the entire barbarian continent lies. It is thousands of mountains and rivers away from this South Ridge. Strong individuals gather there, not only barbarians but also other races like the Undead Clan and the Winged Clan. Many royal clans have strong individuals there, of course including humans!"

"But in the entire barbarian continent, two races are the weakest. One is humans, and the other is our beast clan. Beasts with weak power become food for the barbarians, while humans become slaves!" The purple lightning bird's voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, startling him.

"But where there is oppression, there is resistance. Humans are weak, but long-term oppression has made them extremely united. Eventually they rebelled against Yanhuang City and lived outside it. The barbarians attacked several times but failed to conquer it, so it eventually ended without resolution!"

"But as soon as humans leave their own territory, they face oppression. Some are directly killed, others captured and turned into slaves. That's why I was surprised to see you getting along so well with the barbarian giants!" The purple lightning bird continued.

"Human... I am a human?" Luo Tian sighed inwardly. He looked at Chu Chen beside him. If Chu Chen knew the truth, would he attack him?

"Why do the barbarians hate humans? There are other races too. Why can they live in harmony?" Luo Tian asked his question.

"It seems humans were once powerful and attacked the barbarians. Human masters killed the barbarian masters! As for other races, they are royal clans. In Yanhuang City, they just live there. Their backs are as strong as the barbarians, each clan is no weaker than the barbarians!" The purple lightning bird answered everything without reservation.

One human and one bird continued to exchange thoughts, allowing Luo Tian to fully understand the entire barbarian continent.

"So I advise you, Master, better leave the barbarians first and live here with me. When my two children grow up, I'll take you to where humans used to live!" The purple lightning bird showed a look of reverence.

After hearing the purple lightning bird's words, Luo Tian fell into deep thought. He couldn't remember anything from before and couldn't confirm the truth of what the bird said, but he had already believed eight out of ten.

"Brother, let's go!" Chu Chen saw Luo Tian staring blankly and looked at the purple lightning bird before speaking, showing some impatience.

"Okay!" Luo Tian nodded and gave Chu Chen a nod. He planned to return to the stone village with Chu Chen, and made an agreement with the purple lightning bird that when he needed it, he hoped the bird would take him to where humans used to live.

Before leaving, the purple lightning bird gave Luo Tian a feather, saying that as long as he needed it, lighting the feather would make it appear.

Chu Chen placed Luo Tian on his shoulders and strode out of the mountain range. As for the purple lightning bird, Chu Chen didn't think about killing it or capturing it. The stone village had an unspoken rule: they could only hunt beasts without sentience, not those with awakened intelligence. Cultivation was difficult, and beast cultivation was even more so. Especially in this barbarian continent where beasts were food, this rule had been passed down for a long time.

Along the way, Luo Tian sat on Chu Chen's shoulders, thinking about his future path. The stone village had to be left behind since he didn't belong to the barbarian giants but was a human.

"The most urgent thing is to remember past events. How did I end up here!" Luo Tian made a decision in his heart. Once back at the stone village, he would inquire there. If it was as the purple lightning bird said, then he would leave the stone village and head to where humans used to live.

After returning to the stone village, it was already evening. The children had returned to the stone village, and the villagers gathered together, each holding a stone or bone weapon, heading out to meet Luo Tian and Chu Chen.

"Chu Chen!" Seeing Chu Chen return, people's faces showed a hint of joy. They had heard that Chu Chen was in danger in the South Ridge Mountains and had organized themselves to go rescue him.

"What are you all doing?" Chu Chen looked confused, seeing the tense villagers.

"Saving you!" A middle-aged man spoke, his voice carrying a tone of reproach, looking at several pitiful children behind him.

"Uncle Zhang, it's okay. I'm back now!" Chu Chen smiled awkwardly and walked into the crowd.

Luo Tian looked at these simple giants, smiling but saying nothing.

One person walked into the stone village. They talked and laughed, but as soon as they entered the stone village, the gradually darkening sky trembled. A series of roaring sounds echoed in the air above the stone village, making the villagers look confused.

"Roar..." The roar was deafening. A massive figure appeared above the stone village, its body swirling with black stars.

"Dragon!" The villagers looked surprised. In the barbarian continent, dragons were also hard to tame. Usually, those who could have a dragon as a mount were of high status.

"This stone village people, give me three thousand Primordial Energy Stones within half a month. If you don't, there's no need for you to live!" A thunderous voice echoed above the stone village.

Under the cover of night, thirty strong figures stood on the sky. A middle-aged man stood on a dragon and spoke to the stone village people.

"It's the South Ridge Fierce Sand!" Some villagers recognized the figures above and knew who they were.

"What!" The stone village people murmured, their eyes showing fear. They gathered together, watching the thirty people above anxiously.

"Master, three thousand Primordial Energy Stones are too much. Our stone village only has two hundred people. We can't gather that!" A middle-aged man spoke respectfully, looking at the people above.

"Buzz..." But as soon as the middle-aged giant's words were spoken, a black light flashed. Like a black lightning bolt, it instantly appeared in front of the middle-aged giant.

"Poof..." The middle-aged giant didn't react in time. His massive body was instantly cut in half by the black light, blood splattering everywhere, making people shudder.

"Crack!" The villagers' eyes instantly turned red. They looked at the thirty people above and clenched their stone weapons.

Chu Chen's body trembled, his breathing heavy. He looked at the leader holding a black whip and took off his bone spear.

"Don't fight, we can't afford the South Ridge Fierce Sand!" An old man timidly stopped Chu Chen.

Chapter 1221: South Ridge Fierce Sand

"Uncle Second!" Seeing the old man step out of the crowd, the stone village people showed respect. The old man was the most respected person in the stone village after the chieftain.

The old man's face was aged, but his body remained strong. His hazy eyes looked at the leader of the Fierce Sand and spoke softly: "Master Leader, our stone village only has two hundred people. Three thousand Primordial Energy Stones are indeed a lot. Please grant us a few more days!"

"You old fool, for your sake, I'll give you seven more days. If you don't deliver them in seven days, your clan will be destroyed!" The leader's face showed impatience as he spoke to the old man.

"Okay!" The old man nodded. He looked at the leader and accepted it.

"But you shouldn't think of fleeing. Anyone the Fierce Sand watches, no one can escape. You should know that!" The leader, hearing the old man's acceptance, showed a hint of surprise. His voice carried a tone of disdain. Three thousand Primordial Energy Stones were no small amount even for the Fierce Sand.

But there was an order from above, so he couldn't disobey. Otherwise, this small stone village could be wiped out by these thirty people.

"How dare we? The name of the Fierce Sand is known throughout the South Ridge!" The old man trembled and nodded.

"Go! Remember not to play tricks. Otherwise, we'll wipe out your small stone village!" The leader spoke, his voice full of arrogance. He patted the dragon and left.

"Uncle Zhang!" Seeing the Fierce Sand people leave, the stone village people surrounded the middle-aged man who had been cut in half. Their eyes were red.

"Uncle Second, let's fight! Three thousand Primordial Energy Stones are a big sum for us. We can't gather it!" Chu Chen spoke, his voice filled with strong hatred.

"Yes, we don't fear death. Although the Fierce Sand people are powerful, they'll have to pay a price if they want to destroy us!" The stone village people roared, their voices shaking the sky as they hit their stone weapons.

"Wait for the chieftain to return!" The old man's face showed a flicker of emotion, then sighed deeply. His voice carried helplessness.

The stone village was the weakest in this part of the South Ridge. Its strength wasn't very strong either. Other larger stone villages had masters at the Sage Stage, while their village was celebrating even having Chu Chen as an over-exceptional level. This showed how weak the stone village was.

"Chu Chen, come with me!" The old man turned his back and walked towards the depths of the stone village. His voice was serious.

"Yes!" Chu Chen's eyes narrowed, following the old man's back. His massive body walked towards a stone house.

Others started to collect the middle-aged man's corpse, as people couldn't come back from the dead. The middle-aged man's strength wasn't strong enough to regenerate through blood.

Luo Tian sat on Chu Chen's shoulders, witnessing everything. This middle-aged man had met him the day before and even fought a drinking match with him. Now he was dead, making Luo Tian feel quite emotional.

Kill intent slowly rose in Luo Tian's heart. He looked at the direction where the Fierce Sand had left, his gaze deep.

"Huh?" Luo Tian was startled. Something in his heart seemed to be triggered as he sat on Chu Chen's shoulders.

"What's wrong?" Chu Chen walked forward, suddenly feeling a chill on his shoulder. He shivered and asked Luo Tian.

"Nothing!" Luo Tian shook his head, looking ahead at the old man. The three of them entered a stone garden and sat by a stone table.

"Uncle Second, what did you need?" Chu Chen looked puzzled and asked the old man.

"The stone village is in great danger. You should leave immediately and return to Qinghe City!" The old man sat down and spoke directly.

"You must have heard of the South Ridge Fierce Sand's strength. A thousand-person stone village was wiped out by them before. Even Qinghe City's chieftain, your father, couldn't deal with these bandits. How can our stone village withstand the Fierce Sand's attack?"

"I agreed to it just to give you time to escape. Take a few children from the village and leave!" The old man spoke, his voice carrying a hint of sorrow.

"Uncle Second, when will the chieftain return? If he returns, he might have a solution!" Chu Chen asked but didn't agree to leave.

"Even if the elder returns, there's no solution! Unless the chieftain reaches the Sage Stage, he might have a chance. But it's too hard!" The old man looked sorrowful and gazed at the depths of the stone village.

"Old man, you mean those Fierce Sand bandits are at the Sage Stage?" Luo Tian sat on Chu Chen's shoulders and asked.

"Yes, I heard that the Fierce Sand leader is at the Sage Stage middle level. The one with the whip was probably the third brother, known as Black Snake!" The old man spoke slowly. This stone village had only two over-exceptional levels, and that was including Chu Chen. The other was the chieftain who was in seclusion.

"Sage Stage?" Luo Tian thought, recalling when the purple lightning bird said he was at the Sage Stage. If that's true, could he have a chance?

"They can't escape. I guess those Fierce Sand people have already surrounded the stone village!" Luo Tian shook his head lightly. Although he had lost his memory, it didn't mean his mind was not sharp.

The leader Black Snake's brief look of surprise hadn't escaped Luo Tian's eyes. Also, the three thousand Primordial Energy Stones made it clear that for the stone village, it was impossible to complete. It was clearly a pretext to wipe out the stone village.

"Why?" Chu Chen shook his head, looking at Luo Tian and the old man with confusion.

Luo Tian explained his thoughts and spoke seriously: "It's obvious these bandits came for the stone village. They saw it could gather so many Primordial Energy Stones and wanted to take them first, then attack!"

"Did we offend anyone?" Luo Tian looked at Chu Chen and the old man with inquiry.

"Who did we offend?" Chu Chen and the old man looked at each other, thinking about who they had offended.

The stone village had been in the South Ridge for so long. There were not only this one stone village, but it was definitely impossible to say they hadn't offended anyone. However, fights over hunting were common, but it wasn't enough to reach the level of extermination.

"Could it be him!" Chu Chen and the old man looked at each other, their massive bodies trembling slightly as they spoke in unison.

"Who?" Luo Tian furrowed his brows, he had been there for too short a time to know what happened before he fell unconscious.

"Ban Lie!" Chu Chen and the old man spoke at the same time. After saying this name, they fell silent.

Chu Chen lowered his head, trembling. He hadn't expected Ban Lie to attack him. They were brothers after all.

"Ah... I didn't expect the chieftain's son to collude with the Fierce Sand!" The old man sighed softly and looked at Chu Chen.

"Child, go back to Qinghe City. When you meet your father, he won't dare to attack you!" The old man spoke to Chu Chen.

"I'm not leaving!" Chu Chen's eyes were deep with determination. If he left now, the Fierce Sand might unleash their anger on the stone village. That was something Chu Chen didn't want to see.

Luo Tian felt a stir in his heart. Seeing the determination in Chu Chen's eyes, something inside him was touched. He nodded lightly.

"Brother, go! Your target is small. No one will notice you!" Chu Chen spoke to Luo Tian, not wanting to reveal that he had offended Ban Lie because of Luo Tian.

"My life was saved by you. How could I leave!" Luo Tian shook his head lightly, gazing at Chu Chen.

"Did you forget about the giant ape incident?" Luo Tian smiled slightly. Although he wasn't sure of his strength, he thought he was at least a Sage Stage.

"Yes!" Chu Chen slapped his head. He suddenly remembered the incident where Luo Tian had crushed a giant ape at over-exceptional level. That strength must be at least Sage Stage.

"Let's go meet those Fierce Sand bandits!" Luo Tian patted Chu Chen's shoulder, his face instinctively showing confidence.

"Okay!" Chu Chen nodded heavily and spoke to the old man: "Uncle Second, I'll go check if the Fierce Sand people have left!"

"Be careful!" The old man's eyes showed worry. He didn't know why Chu Chen suddenly became so confident.

"Rest assured, there won't be any problems!" Chu Chen nodded and led Luo Tian out of the stone village.

As soon as they stepped out, Chu Chen slowed his pace. Although he didn't know where the Fierce Sand people were hiding, he felt a sense of danger immediately upon leaving the stone village.

"Let's go east for eight hundred paces. There's one!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his mind instantly seeing a giant hiding there. His aura was suppressed to the maximum.

"Okay!" Chu Chen nodded and walked towards the direction Luo Tian indicated. That direction was toward Qinghe City.

"Seems they really plan to escape. The leader was right!" Eight hundred paces away, a giant showed coldness on his face, watching Chu Chen approaching. Luo Tian was ignored completely.

As they got closer, Chu Chen felt that there really was someone hiding. But he still couldn't find the exact location.

"Should we kill one first?" As Chu Chen kept searching for the hidden person, Luo Tian's voice echoed in his mind.

Chapter 1222: Bloodbath of the Fierce Sand Bandits

"Kill!" Hearing Luo Tian's words, Chu Chen's face turned serious. At this point, there was only one chance to fight for a chance of survival. He had bet everything on Luo Tian's strength, betting that it could counter the entire Fierce Sand. It was a gamble, wagering the lives of everyone in the stone village on Luo Tian.

"Okay!" Luo Tian jumped down from Chu Chen's shoulders, gazing at the direction where the Fierce Sand bandit was hiding.

"Huh?" Seeing Luo Tian's small figure, the bandit furrowed his brows. He hadn't really observed Luo Tian before.

At this moment, seeing Luo Tian gazing at him, the bandit's eyes showed disbelief. He was shocked internally.

"He found me? Impossible! I hid so well, even over-exceptional level masters couldn't find me. How could this little dwarf find me!" The bandit thought internally, gazing at Luo Tian.

But before the bandit could think further, Luo Tian immediately used his full strength. He pushed off the ground and ran toward the bandit.

"Fast!" Chu Chen's face was stunned, seeing Luo Tian instantly disappear from his sight. He spoke in shock.

Luo Tian now only used his physical strength, simply throwing punches. But even so, it was incredibly powerful. The over-exceptional level bandit was still wondering how Luo Tian had found him, and before he could react, Luo Tian had already reached his massive body. He threw a simple punch at the giant's body.

"Crack..." The sound of cracking echoed everywhere. A simple punch contained powerful strength. The bandit's eyes still showed confusion, then changed to fear. His entire body was enveloped in the aura of death and exploded into a mist of blood, scattering onto the ground.

"Who!" A figure moved. As soon as the Fierce Sand bandit died, a sound of roaring echoed. A series of strong figures appeared in Luo Tian and Chu Chen's line of sight.

"They really didn't leave!" Chu Chen's face turned cold. He looked at the black-cloaked Fierce Sand leader and took out his bone spear, tightly gripping it to prepare for a fight.

Luo Tian stood in front of Chu Chen with his small body, emitting an inexplicable aura. This calmed Chu Chen's tense heart. Although Luo Tian was small, he seemed like a mountain to Chu Chen. It felt as if nothing was impossible with Luo Tian there.

"Who are you?" The third leader of the Fierce Sand, Black Snake, furrowed his brows. He looked at Luo Tian's small figure, which was disproportionate to theirs, and asked.

"Luo Tian!" Luo Tian spoke softly. His small body walked toward the thirty people, quickly reaching a subordinate of the ninth source supreme. He threw a punch.

"Boom..." Blood mist spread everywhere, blood splattering onto Luo Tian's body. This made him completely red.

"Kill him!" Black Snake's eyes changed. At this point, he realized Luo Tian was quite troublesome. His thick black whip swung and turned into a black snake, wrapping around Luo Tian.

"Crack... crack..." Seeing the leader had started fighting, thirty subordinates lifted their weapons and smashed at Luo Tian.

A punch was thrown. Although the fists were small, they collided with weapons as big as mountains.

"Die!" Seeing Luo Tian being so bold, the thirty bandits showed a hint of mockery. Who in the entire South Ridge could withstand being attacked by so many?

"Crack..." Luo Tian's legs were deeply embedded in the ground, but his small body was unharmed. Chu Chen widened his eyes.

Not only was Luo Tian unharmed, but the stone weapons of the other people were all thrown out from their hands and scattered around. Not only was Chu Chen surprised, but the bandits including the leader Black Snake also showed shock, looking at Luo Tian like a monster.

Luo Tian sighed deeply. He looked at his intact fists and was surprised to find himself so powerful.

"If that's the case, then it's my turn!" Luo Tian pulled his legs out of the ground and looked at the stunned Fierce Sand bandits.

"Boom..." Blood splattered everywhere. Luo Tian appeared beside a bandit and threw a punch, sending more blood flying.

After killing one bandit, Luo Tian didn't care about the thick blood around him. He walked toward another bandit and threw a punch again.

"One punch... two punches..." Luo Tian kept walking, throwing punches. Each time, a massive giant fell to his death with one punch, making people shudder.

Blood covered Luo Tian's entire body. He was completely red with blood, leaving only his bright eyes visible. He looked like a demon emerging from hell, continuously harvesting the lives of Fierce Sand giants.

"One... ten... twenty..." Each giant turned into a mist of blood. The scene was spectacular, with blood dyeing the earth.

"Boom..." Luo Tian smashed the last subordinate. A total of thirty Fierce Sand bandits remained with only the black-cloaked third leader.

"You... don't come closer!" The third leader was completely terrified by Luo Tian's strength. His eyes showed intense fear as he spoke to the blood-drenched Luo Tian.

"Buzz..." Luo Tian stopped. He looked at his hands covered in blood, and flashes of familiar images passed through his mind. In the pictures, there was also a lot of blood. Thousands of humans appeared before him. He was also covered in blood, with black energy swirling around him. A black demon sword was held in his hand, slicing through the sky and annihilating thousands of horses and soldiers with one slash.

"My hands are stained with blood?" Luo Tian whispered to himself, looking at his blood-covered hands. His eyes flashed with confusion. He wanted to remember more but couldn't.

"Be careful!" A shout brought Luo Tian back to reality. He shook his head and saw a black snake rushing toward him, wrapping around him tightly. Cold energy infiltrated his body.

"Haha!" The leader named Black Snake laughed, looking at Luo Tian wrapped in his whip. He slightly tightened it.

"Crinkle..." The leader's slight tightening caused a sound from the black whip.

"Luo Tian!" Chu Chen shouted, lifting his bone spear and stabbing it at Black Snake's leader.

"Get out!" Black Snake shouted, extending his foot. He let the bone spear stab him and kicked Chu Tian's chest.

Chu Chen was over-exceptional level, but Black Snake was at the Sage Stage early. The difference between them was too great. His black foot almost shattered Chu Chen, but since Chu Chen's body was stronger than most over-exceptional level individuals, this kick would have killed him or left him severely injured.

Blood spewed everywhere. Chu Chen's massive body flew backward, falling to the ground with a heavy sound and kicking up a lot of dust. His chest bones also broke.

"Kid, don't resist! Once you're wrapped in this black snake whip, no matter how strong you are, you won't survive!" Black Snake's face showed coldness. He looked at Luo Tian tightly wrapped in the black whip and spoke confidently, unlike before.

"I don't think it's that big of a deal!" A low voice replied. Black Snake's face changed. Normally, even someone of the same level would be unable to speak once wrapped in his whip. But Luo Tian's voice was strong and clear, not like someone who couldn't breathe.

"Boom..." However, the answer to Black Snake was a crackling sound. Then it exploded like a bomb. The black whip that had wrapped around Luo Tian several times began to crack.
