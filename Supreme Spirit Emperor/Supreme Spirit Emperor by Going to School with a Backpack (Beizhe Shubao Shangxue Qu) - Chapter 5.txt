Zhang Qi never expected that an ordinary person with no energy fluctuations at all could send him flying. He realized he had encountered another formidable opponent, although it wasn't as brutal as the three black-cloaked men in the hotel. Still, this was a thorny problem.

"You dare to hit me?" Zhang Qi stared at Luo Tian in disbelief. Though he knew Luo Tian was formidable, his usual arrogance made him ask the question.

"Smack..." Luo Tian cursed inwardly at the fool, then delivered another slap. He lifted Zhang Qi up again.

Zhang Qi's attendants were stunned, silently lamenting that their master had chosen an unlucky day to meet such formidable people.

This young man was clearly no ordinary person without energy fluctuations. He was definitely a master at Body Refinement Stage Five or higher. They hadn't even reacted before their master was lifted into the air—how could they fight?

"You can't touch me! Otherwise, my father won't let you live!" Zhang Qi boasted. "My father is the city lord of Xuantian City. If you harm me, I guarantee you won't leave Xuantian alive!"

"You're resorting to your father's name? I hate it when people threaten me!" Luo Tian chuckled as he held Zhang Qi.

"What do you want? Let me go!" Zhang Qi's face finally crumbled. He sighed inwardly, cursing his bad luck.

"Hand over all your money and theirs. Break your own legs, and you can leave!" Luo Tian placed Zhang Qi on the ground. He was confident that a mere Body Refinement Stage Two opponent like Zhang Qi couldn't escape his grasp.

"Don't push your luck. This is Xuantian City!" Zhang Qi's expression turned sinister. He had never suffered such losses before—first, he was scared off and lost face; now, he was lifted into the air and thrown to the ground. He hadn't experienced such humiliation since birth.

"Boy, quickly release our master or else no matter your status, you won't leave Xuantian alive!" The attendants shouted in unison.

"Seems you don't agree with my words. Then I'll have to do it myself!" Luo Tian said, then swiftly took Zhang Qi's storage pouch.

"Crack..." A crisp sound of bones breaking echoed as Luo Tian's big foot brutally crushed Zhang Qi's legs.

Seeing Luo Tian actually cripple Zhang Qi, the Zhang family's attendants felt a chill. They knew how much their city lord loved Zhang Qi; even a small scratch on him would result in punishment. Now, with his legs broken, it was unthinkable.

"Go!" Luo Tian said to Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei as if nothing had happened, then headed outside.

Due to Luo Tian's formidable strength, the four-stage Body Refinement attendants didn't dare make a sound. Before they could react, Luo Tian and the others had already vanished from Xuantian City.

Chapter 19: The Elder with the Dai Surname

Luo Tian led the two to a secluded corner, his face showing concern as he said to Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei: "Hurry! If I'm not mistaken, the city lord of Xuantian will arrive soon!"

After saying that, Luo Tian vanished first toward the city outskirts. Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei exchanged glances before following Luo Tian out of the city. Their figures quickly disappeared from Xuantian City.

Not long after they left, several figures appeared in the inn. The leader was a middle-aged man in his forties with deep-set eyes and an aura of superiority.

The man frowned, looking at Zhang Qi lying on the ground. He asked lowly: "Who is the head of your attendants?"

"Report, my lord. I am," a middle-aged man in Body Refinement Stage Four stepped forward, his voice trembling.

Zhang Xuantian frowned and didn't ask a second question. A red palm shot out, striking the attendant head's head.

The attendant's head flew off his shoulders without even a chance to resist, dying instantly under Zhang Xuantian's palm.

The surrounding attendants felt a chill. They feared they might be the next target, all kneeling in submission.

"Find out who these two men and one woman are. Who dared to cripple my son's legs in Xuantian City? Dai Shu, you handle this personally. Capture these three—no matter if they live or die!" Zhang Xuantian ordered the plain-clothed elder.

The elder nodded, his expression unreadable. His figure gradually faded in the attendants' stunned gazes.

Zhang Xuantian didn't issue any more orders. He trusted Dai Shu completely; even he wouldn't gain an advantage against him. Dai Shu's specialty was tracking—no trace would escape his eyes.

Zhang Xuantian ordered people to carry the unconscious Zhang Qi and headed toward the city lord's mansion.

Luo Tian and the others ran until they reached a sparsely populated area. Gu Lei was already panting heavily, his plump body swaying awkwardly. Among the three, he had the weakest cultivation; merely keeping up with Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue was already a struggle.

"Luo Tian, why did we suddenly run away? I hadn't even punished that bastard yet!" Gu Lei complained.

"Shut up..." Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue's voices rang out simultaneously. They exchanged glances, seeing the same concern in each other's eyes.

"You two are really默契!" Gu Lei muttered, but his face soon turned grim. He saw an old man approaching them slowly.

Gu Lei didn't know who the old man was, but he knew he meant trouble. What made Gu Lei's face grim was the old man's astonishing speed—he reached their group in a few steps.

"Body Refinement Stage Seven!" Luo Tian's expression was serious but also relieved. If it were Body Refinement Stage Eight Zhang Xuantian, they'd have no chance at all. At Body Refinement Stage Seven, if they used the Five Elements Mutual Generation Human King Seal, there was still a chance to escape.

"Is it you who crippled our master's legs?" The old man lightly landed in front of Luo Tian, his eyes showing confusion as he addressed Gu Qianxue. He was puzzled how a Body Refinement Stage Four woman could do it, wondering what kind of genius could cripple someone in a group of equals.

Luo Tian heard the old man's words, his mind stirred. He knew the old man still considered him an ordinary person.

"If that's the case, our chances of escape are greater!" Luo Tian felt happy inside but showed fear on his face, slowly hiding behind Gu Lei.

"Are you going to bully the young? We are from Tianyuan City's Gu family. Please consider our clan and let us go!" Gu Qianxue realized Luo Tian's plan to ambush the old man, so she started to stall him.

"Trying to waste time?" The old man coldly laughed. He didn't care why Gu Qianxue was stalling; to him, any strategy was useless against absolute strength.

"Attack!" Luo Tian roared. Gu Qianxue, who had been secretly gathering energy, launched her Great Yang Palm immediately. Gu Lei also threw a talisman. Luo Tian's left hand wielded the Flame Dragon Hand, while his right hand summoned the Human King Seal.

Suddenly, fire surged, surrounding the old man with flames. Smoke filled the air.

"Such martial arts could hurt me? Show me all your tricks! It's been a while since I killed a genius. Youngsters with such cultivation must be extraordinary, but before they grow, they're just infants!" Dai Shu's voice echoed.

Before Dai Shu finished speaking, a terrifying fluctuation erupted from above him. A five-colored seal smashed down.

"Old dog! Try this! Five Elements Mutual Generation, Human King Seal! Go!" A deep roar echoed.

"Boom..." Another terrifying explosion sounded.

"Damn it! Deceitful little brats!" Dai Shu cursed inwardly, regretting his underestimation of the young men. He was shocked at their identities; one of them could even use five-element martial arts.

But he had no time to think. He hadn't even managed to cast a defensive technique before the seal smashed him squarely.

A deep pit formed where the seal fell. The Dai surname elder lay on the ground like a dead dog, his eyes filled with intense regret.

Luo Tian saw the fallen elder, his eyes gleaming with joy. The elder was too overconfident; not only was the elder's terrifying speed unmatched, but his Body Refinement Stage Seven cultivation wasn't something Luo Tian and his companions could match. Fortunately, the elder thought he was an ordinary person and underestimated his martial arts; otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

"Are you regretful? You're so old yet still fall to our hands. I really want to say your age is wasted on a dog! Don't you know the saying about lions and rabbits?" Luo Tian smiled, sighing.

"Lo! Why talk to such an old dog? He's senile!" Gu Lei was also in high spirits. Never had they thought three people could defeat a Body Refinement Stage Seven warrior. Though he hadn't contributed much, he felt inexplicably excited.

Being called "old dog" and "old thing" by Luo Tian and Gu Lei, the already disgruntled Dai Shu spat out old blood, his eyes rolled back, and he fainted.

Chapter 20: Gu Lei's Crisis

Seeing the old man faint, the three sighed in relief. Gu Lei stepped forward to the elder's side.

"Ah! Body Refinement Stage Seven really is different. Taking a Five Elements Mutual Generation Human King Seal and still not dying—only fainting. Indeed, it's much stronger than Body Refinement Stage Six!" Gu Lei muttered as he approached the elder, took out his storage pouch and tossed it to Luo Tian.

"Alright, let's go. We've both expended a lot. If anyone else comes, we're done!" Gu Qianxue urged as she saw Gu Lei dragging his feet.

Gu Lei raised his fat fist, intending to finish off the elder. At that moment, an unexpected event occurred: the elder suddenly opened his eyes and spat a blood line directly at Gu Lei's chest, sending him flying backward.

The elder left a shadow behind and disappeared from Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue's sight. A furious voice echoed: "You little brats, I'll avenge this someday!"

Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue didn't hear what the elder said. They flew to Gu Lei's side, looking at his chest which was purple.

"Poisoned!" They both thought simultaneously. They exchanged glances, and Gu Qianxue looked to Luo Tian for help.

"What should we do?" Luo Tian also became anxious. Among the Gu family, he and Gu Lei were closest. Now that Gu Lei was poisoned, he was extremely worried.

"Qianxue, don't panic. First, we need to know what poison it is. Wait for me; I'll give him some basic healing medicine first," Luo Tian instructed Gu Qianxue, who was at a loss.

Luo Tian closed his eyes, recalling the "Hundred Chapters of Herbal Medicine." Though it recorded medicines and herbs, it also documented poisons. Luo Tian hadn't paid much attention to the poison section before.

"Wrong... wrong..." His mind flashed with names of poisons and their symptoms.

After half an hour, under Gu Qianxue's anxious gaze, Luo Tian suddenly opened his eyes and exclaimed excitedly: "Found it!"

"What is it? What kind of poison?" Gu Qianxue asked anxiously, as Gu Lei's complexion was worsening.

"Seven-Stage Absorbing Soul Poison!" Luo Tian sighed, regretful. He wondered how the old man had such a poison.

"Seven-Stage Absorbing Soul Poison" meant that the poisoned person would live seven days. If they couldn't find an antidote, they'd be drained of their soul energy and die.

Hearing Luo Tian's explanation, Gu Qianxue's eyes flashed with self-reproach. If Gu Lei died, how could she face her father? As his sister, she hadn't taken care of her brother properly.

"What's the method to antidote it?" Gu Qianxue asked with a glimmer of hope.

"There are two methods. The first is for a Body Refinement Stage or higher strength to expel the poison with strong soul energy. The second is to find a body-refining elixir or spiritual herb to refine the toxins out of the body," Luo Tian explained in detail.

Hoping for a solution, Gu Qianxue's face showed helplessness. If they were in Tianyuan City's Gu family, it would be possible to treat Gu Lei. After all, the Gu family was deeply rooted in Tianyuan City; although they couldn't find a Bone-Refining Stage strength, they could find spiritual herbs. But now, three people were far from Xuantian City—where would they find a Bone-Refining Stage strength or body-refining elixirs and herbs?

"Body-refining... body-refining..." Luo Tian kept repeating the phrase. Suddenly, a spark of inspiration struck him: "Taiyin Washing Marrow Grass!"

"Taiyin Washing Marrow Grass?" Gu Qianxue looked at Luo Tian in confusion, not understanding his meaning.

"Maybe... Gu Lei has a chance. Let's find a place to settle first and then discuss the plan!" Luo Tian said to Gu Qianxue.

Hearing that Gu Lei had a chance, Gu Qianxue couldn't stay. The two dragged Gu Lei toward a distant village.

Fortunately, the villagers were simple and kind. Though many families didn't want to take in guests, eventually good-hearted people took them in. A couple welcomed Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue.

In the evening, Luo Tian explained his plan to Gu Qianxue. He decided to infiltrate Xuantian City and attend the Xuantian Auction, hoping to buy the Taiyin Washing Marrow Grass. If he couldn't buy it, he'd steal or rob it.

"Impossible! It's too dangerous! Now the whole city has our portraits. Maybe they'll search this village soon. I can't let you take the risk for my brother," Gu Qianxue firmly refused Luo Tian's proposal.

"Stop pretending you don't know what you're thinking. You want to go yourself, right? You fool! Who's stronger between us?" Luo Tian naturally knew Gu Qianxue's thoughts and scolded her.

Hearing Luo Tian call her a fool, Gu Qianxue blushed inexplicably. She remembered her father often called her mother that way.

Seeing Gu Qianxue blush, Luo Tian thought he had said too much and took a breath: "Gu Lei is not only your brother but also my brother. And I am a man!"

Gu Qianxue's emotions were chaotic. Hearing Luo Tian say that, she nodded obediently. If Gu Lei were awake, he'd be shocked—his usually dominant sister had such a side.

That night, Luo Tian's room was suddenly filled with golden light, scaring the couple who had taken them in to kneel and bow repeatedly. Fortunately, Gu Qianxue calmed them down, and they returned to their room to sleep.

...

In Xuantian City's city lord's mansion, Zhang Xuantian sat in the center. On his left lay his son Zhang Qi; on his right, Dai Shu, who had followed him for twenty years.

Zhang Xuantian's face was gloomy. He had sent Dai Shu to chase the three young people who injured his son, but instead of returning, Dai Shu had returned severely wounded and unconscious.

Zhang Xuantian hesitated: "Dai Shu could match me with his skills. How did he fall to three young people? Who are these three? Could they be disciples of a major sect? Xuantian City is close to the Five Elements Sect. Could they be disciples of the Five Elements Sect coming down?"

But Zhang Xuantian quickly dismissed this thought. Disciples of the Five Elements Sect wore their distinctive clothing, so they wouldn't be dressed normally.

"Search... find out where they are no matter what! Hmph! Even if they're disciples of a major sect, they couldn't harm my son and escape unscathed!"

Chapter 21: Re-entering Xuantian City

The next morning, Luo Tian wore a farmer's borrowed clothes, pretending to go to the city to sell vegetables.

Fortunately, Luo Tian's appearance wasn't remarkable. He had been a farmer before, so no need to act—he was the very image of a rural youth.

As soon as Luo Tian entered the city, he faced strict checks. Fortunately, there were no signs of energy fluctuations on him; otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to attend the auction or even enter the city.

He reached a secluded corner and changed out of the farmer's clothes, putting on black attire with a large straw hat.

Today was the day of the Xuantian Auction. Luo Tian mingled in the crowd, paying five energy stones to enter the auction hall.

Luo Tian sighed at the darkness of the auction. The entrance fee alone required five energy stones. Energy stones were the universal currency on Tianyuan Continent; one stone was enough for a farmer to live well for a year. Fortunately, Luo Tian had seized Zhang Qi and the elder's storage pouches, so he wasn't worried about these five stones.

Though the entrance fee was surprisingly high, the hall was packed with people. Luo Tian found his seat and looked around at the noisy crowd, frowning slightly. He disliked such crowded places; it was easier to expose his identity.

If Luo Tian's identity were exposed now, he knew even with wings, he couldn't escape Xuantian City.

"Ah... this auction is truly unprecedented! Several city lords from other cities have come. Look, isn't that the young lord of Wentian City? I didn't expect him to come! Also, the young lord of Baiyi City... and..." A black-faced man muttered to his companion in the crowd.

"Cut it out. You know nothing. Do you really think they came for this auction? I guess it's just a coincidence. Haven't you forgotten that the Five Elements Sect's recruitment day is coming in half a month?" The man's companion replied.

"Oh, right! Five Elements Sect... only such geniuses can go there," the black-faced man said, enviously.

Luo Tian extended his spiritual sense to listen to the surrounding discussions. Following their gaze, he saw several young men sitting in front positions, all elegant and refined. On the tables beside them were various snacks, and attendants served them with arrogance.

As Luo Tian looked around, a domineering voice echoed: "Cough... I am Zhang Xuantian, the city lord of Xuantian City. Welcome to this year's Xuantian Auction. I hope everyone can get what they need. Now, let me announce that this auction officially begins!"

Luo Tian heard the voice and his heart tightened. He knew he was no match for Zhang Xuantian now. His breathing quickened.

As Zhang Xuantian's loud voice echoed, a seductive woman entered the auction stage.

"Hello everyone. I am Mianqing, the auction host of this auction. First, let's present our first item," Mianqing's voice was pleasant and alluring, earning many whistles from the crowd.

But people only whistled; everyone in Xuantian City knew Mianqing was Zhang Xuantian's forbidden woman. Anyone who dared to eye her would be mercilessly dealt with by Zhang Xuantian.

Luo Tian found Mianqing attractive, but compared to Gu Qianxue, she was a different level.

Not long after, several people pushed a box onto the stage. Mianqing swayed her body toward the box, making some people excited.

Mianqing's voice echoed: "First auction item is a Yellow Grade Lower weapon!"

Luo Tian was shocked at the high quality of this Xuantian Auction. Though they usually presented a good item to liven up the atmosphere, it was rare for the first item to be a Yellow Grade weapon.

Luo Tian had encountered a Yellow Grade weapon only twice in his life. The first time was when he saw Li Xiuping's long sword.

The crowd also showed great interest in the covered box, with many people eager to win it.

Mianqing gently lifted the cover, revealing a long sword about three feet long, radiating cold light.

"This Yellow Grade long sword was obtained by the Xuantian City Lord in a relic site. The starting price is fifty thousand energy stones. Let the bidding begin!" Mianqing's alluring voice echoed.

"Sixty thousand energy stones!" A thin man shouted immediately after Mianqing's voice.

"Ha! That's just a few energy stones to bid on a Yellow Grade long sword! One hundred thousand energy stones!" The young lord of Wentian City said arrogantly.

The thin man was red-faced from the young lord's words but had no choice. He couldn't afford it, and his family background wasn't as prominent, so he had to swallow his anger.

Luo Tian was impressed. A Yellow Grade long sword could sell for such a high price, and this was just the beginning. His bag had enough energy stones from Zhang Qi and the elder's storage pouches, plus Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei's, totaling about thirty thousand. Luo Tian silently prayed: "I hope the price of Taiyin Washing Marrow Grass doesn't exceed thirty thousand."

While Luo Tian was lost in thought, the Yellow Grade long sword was eventually sold to the young lord of Wentian City for thirty thousand energy stones. However, his face wasn't good either; thirty thousand energy stones weren't a joke.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian carefully sat there, not daring to bid on any items he was interested in, unsure of how many energy stones Taiyin Washing Marrow Grass would cost.

When he saw a vial of Body-Refining Elixir sold for one thousand energy stones, his mood slightly improved. After all, he still had many Body-Refining Elixirs in his storage pouch.

"Next auction item: a spiritual herb called Taiyin Washing Marrow Grass. It has the effect of washing marrow and refining bones, a miraculous elixir for Body-Refining Stage practitioners!" Mianqing's voice echoed.

The hall fell silent. Most people didn't understand the effects of Taiyin Washing Marrow Grass, but the young lords from various cities had uneven breathing. Their main purpose for coming was the legendary Five Elements Sect's cultivation manual, and their second goal was Taiyin Washing Marrow Grass.

Luo Tian heard Mianqing's words and felt a shock. He thought it had arrived. His spiritual sense scanned the surroundings, noticing the young lords' eager expressions. He sighed inwardly: "Ah, it won't be easy to get it."

"Even if I can't win it, I'll steal or rob it. I can't let Gu Lei die!" Luo Tian clenched his fist, making a determined decision. Even if it meant betraying his conscience once for Gu Lei, it was worth it.

"Everyone who understands its value knows its effects. I won't explain further. The starting price is ten thousand energy stones. Let the bidding begin!" Mianqing didn't bother with more explanations and announced the start.

"Thirteen thousand!" The young lord of Baiyi City spoke lowly.

"Fifteen thousand!" The young master of Chihuo City also shouted.

"Eighteen thousand... twenty thousand..." Luo Tian listened to the increasing prices and shook his head.

When the price reached twenty-five thousand, there was a brief pause in the hall.

Luo Tian took out a pill from his pocket and swallowed it, coughing slightly to make his voice hoarse: "Thirty thousand!"

Chapter 22: Success

"Thirty thousand!" Luo Tian's hoarse voice echoed. The pill he had just taken was one that could change a person's voice, making his current voice sound like an old man in his seventies.

"Hey?" When Luo Tian shouted the price, most people's eyes focused on him.

Luo Tian was sitting in an ordinary seat. The bidders were all seated in front positions, and people in ordinary seats rarely had the means to bid thirty thousand.

"Hmph! Thirty-five thousand!" The young lord of Wentian City, who had been arrogant before, now looked unhappy and continued to bid. He had already spent a lot on the Yellow Grade long sword, so he knew the chance of competing for the legendary Five Elements Sect's cultivation manual was slim. He decided to go all in and grab this Taiyin Washing Marrow Grass.

"Forty thousand!" Luo Tian's old voice continued to echo.

"Friend, can you give me a favor and let go of this Taiyin Washing Marrow Grass? The Wentian City is willing to befriend you. Forty-one thousand!" The young lord of Wentian City coldly said, radiating his Body Refinement Stage Seven aura to intimidate Luo Tian.

"You Wentian City are what? You dare to compete with an old man!" Luo Tian coldly smiled.

"Boom..." A terrifying aura surged upwards, making the young lord's aura seem like an adult bullying a child.

"Body Refinement Stage!" The arrogant youth, pale-faced, stammered the words.

The composed Zhang Xuantian in the back felt this aura and was frightened. He hurriedly walked to the front, just hearing Luo Tian's authoritative words.

Yes, Luo Tian now displayed the aura of Body Refinement Stage. Last night, he had desperately opened the "Epoch Book" to gain more protection when entering Xuantian City. After opening it, he obtained this skill that could mimic a higher cultivation stage—though it was a minor ability.

Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue had thought of this plan overnight: take a voice-changing pill, mimic the aura of Body Refinement Stage, and boldly leave Xuantian City. Otherwise, even if he successfully bought the herb, leaving Xuantian City would be a problem.

"Body Refinement Stage! My lord..." The young lord of Wentian City, Zhang Hongyun, spoke with a trembling voice.

"Damn it! I'm so stupid to provoke a Body Refinement Stage man?" Zhang Hongyun sighed inwardly, thinking he was about to die.

"Are you still going to compete with an old man?" Luo Tian's voice was cold and sharp.

"Junior, junior dare not! Junior is willing to bid for the Taiyin Washing Marrow Grass and offer it to you, hoping you won't hold a grudge against junior," Zhang Hongyun said, drenched in sweat. He hoped this Body Refinement Stage's anger would subside.

Zhang Xuantian was also extremely nervous. He didn't know a Body Refinement Stage strength had entered his Xuantian City, and he felt a chill. He quickly bowed: "Junior Zhang Xuantian respectfully invites you to visit the city lord's mansion, to atone for my negligence!"

"Go to your city lord's mansion? My mind must have been kicked by a donkey!" Luo Tian mentally mocked.

"Let's go. I'm just passing through here. I heard this place was auctioning Taiyin Washing Marrow Grass, and since I need it for a pill, I came here to buy it!" Luo Tian said calmly, revealing his identity as an alchemist.

"Ah..." A gasp echoed. No one expected this old man to be both a Body Refinement Stage and an alchemist!

Alchemists were as common as bee hives on the Tianyuan Continent. Small sects dared not offend a fourth-grade alchemist.

According to rumors, there was once an alchemist at Body Refinement Stage who clashed with a small sect. The small sect didn't take the alchemist seriously, beating and humiliating him before ignoring him. They hadn't expected that the next day, their sect was attacked and destroyed by a group of Body Refinement Stage strengths.

Now this old man wasn't only a Body Refinement Stage but also an alchemist, and his grade was at least fourth-grade.

Zhang Hongyun almost urinated himself in fear. He secretly thanked the old man for being kind, otherwise not only would he be in trouble but also his father and Wentian City would be at the mercy of this man.

"Quickly, send the herb to the old man!" Zhang Xuantian was also nervous. This black-cloaked old man's identity was too terrifying, so he didn't dare to delay and ordered his subordinates to send the Taiyin Washing Marrow Grass to Luo Tian.

Luo Tian took the herb and followed the principle of "playing it all out," saying coldly: "Hmph, I'm in a good mood today. Next time I pass through Xuantian City, I'll visit you!"

Zhang Xuantian was happy. Gaining a Body Refinement Stage strength for Xuantian City was like gaining a big support. Plus, he was an alchemist of high grade. He quickly bowed and said: "Next time I'll certainly do my best to entertain you."

Luo Tian mentally mocked: "Old dog, don't know what your mood will be when you see me again. I guess by then you'll wish to eat me!"

"White Emperor City... Red Fire City..." Several voices echoed. The young lords in the hall all bowed to Luo Tian, hoping he would visit their cities.

Luo Tian waved his hand: "Alright. If it's convenient, I'll come. But today I have a pill to refine, so I won't stay long. By the way, Zhang Xuantian, give me a city exit token. Otherwise, if I hurt your subordinates later, it'll be bad. I don't know why you're so timid; even entering and exiting the city requires such strict searches!"

"Yes, yes!" Zhang Xuantian quickly took out a token from his waist and sent it to Luo Tian's hands.

"Then I'll take my leave. You all continue!" Luo Tian walked out of the auction hall, and as soon as he stepped outside, his figure vanished toward the city outskirts.

With Luo Tian's departure, the pressure disappeared. The auction hall was briefly silent before resuming chaos. People felt it was worth participating in today's auction, as Body Refinement Stage strength rarely appeared in such cities—especially a Body Refinement Stage alchemist!

Zhang Hongyun wiped his cold sweat, secretly thanking himself for not being so arrogant. He vowed never to be so reckless again; otherwise, he wouldn't know how he died. If he died, it wasn't a big deal, but if his family was affected, that would be a serious offense.

As for what these people thought, Luo Tian didn't care. He had already rushed out of the city toward the farmer's house.

Chapter 23: Refining the Washing Marrow Elixir

Gu Qianxue stood at the farmer's house, looking at Gu Lei on the bed. She thought about Luo Tian's冒险 to re-enter Xuantian City, her eyes showing concern.

These two days had felt like years for Gu Qianxue. Seeing Gu Lei's chest turning increasingly purple and black, she was anxious. But she believed the man could successfully retrieve the Taiyin Washing Marrow Grass, as he had created impossible miracles more than once.

Luo Tian ran all the way and finally returned to the farmer's house. As soon as he entered the courtyard, he saw Gu Qianxue anxiously looking at the door. His heart warmed.

When Gu Qianxue saw Luo Tian return, her heart finally relaxed. At least Luo Tian had returned safely. If something happened to him again, she wouldn't know what to do. Although Gu Qianxue seemed tough, she was still a girl.

Luo Tian smiled at her: "I haven't failed!"

Hearing Luo Tian's words, Gu Qianxue was overjoyed. She had thought it was the best outcome for Luo Tian to return, but he had actually retrieved the Taiyin Washing Marrow Grass from the heavily guarded Xuantian City.

"But I still need a day. Although we've obtained the herb, refining the Washing Marrow Elixir isn't easy! After all, it's a second-grade elixir and quite difficult to refine!" Luo Tian sighed softly.

Luo Tian rested for a night. The next morning, he and Gu Qianxue stood in the farmer's courtyard. The couple had gone out to work, so only Luo Tian, Gu Qianxue, and the unconscious Gu Lei remained.

They had sorted out the herbs the previous night and found they could refine two batches of Washing Marrow Elixirs. They decided to each refine one batch, and if one succeeded, it would be enough.

Now Gu Qianxue stood by the cauldron, her face unusually serious. Her white hands reached toward the fire mouth, and she threw herbs into the cauldron one by one, turning them into pure elixir liquid.

Not long after, all herbs except the Taiyin Washing Marrow Grass had turned into pure elixir liquid. Gu Qianxue's forehead was covered in sweat.

The first major challenge of refining the Washing Marrow Elixir had begun. The Taiyin Washing Marrow Grass was an extremely cold spiritual herb, requiring strong spiritual awareness to control the fire and refine it gradually. If one's spiritual awareness wasn't strong enough, this batch of elixir would be declared a failure.

Luo Tian watched Gu Qianxue's skilled operations and nodded inwardly: "The Gu family isn't disappointing. This level of skill is beyond ordinary alchemists; it must be from years of using herbs."

Gu Qianxue didn't care what Luo Tian thought. She adjusted her breathing and threw half a Taiyin Washing Marrow Grass into the cauldron. Her eyes were filled with determination, and she controlled the fire to refine the elixir's power carefully.

An hour passed quickly. Gu Qianxue's face was pale, obviously exhausted from the one-hour effort. Her body was drenched in sweat, revealing her figure to Luo Tian.

However, Luo Tian had no time to appreciate it. His eyes were fixed on the cauldron, praying Gu Qianxue would succeed, as he himself wasn't sure if he could refine it successfully.

Gu Qianxue sighed in self-mockery but, seeing only a small section left to refine, gritted her teeth and trembled slightly as she hit the fire mouth.
