“Alas,” Wang Gang spoke, his gaze turning to Luo Tian. “I heard that Su Dan has already died!”

“Crack…” Upon hearing Wang Gang’s words, Luo Tian’s wine glass shattered in his hand with a sharp crack.

“What happened?” Luo Tian ignored the spilled wine, his gaze turning to Wang Gang and the others.

Su Dan left a deep impression on Luo Tian, especially that night—whether it was Fu Xingxuan or not remained unclear.

“The heir to the Demon King you saw is named Su Kai, the younger son of the Demon King. He was previously obscure but later emerged as a formidable force!”

“Rumors say that after Su Dan returned, she was overthrown by him. As for how it happened, we don’t know. From that moment on, Su Dan vanished without a trace,” Wang Gang said, his words heavy with meaning, causing Luo Tian’s breath to deepen.

“Luo elder brother, so much time has passed. The world has changed; you should let go. You’ve already angered a Demon King—angering the Demon King would be unwise!” Mo Er advised Luo Tian.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian nodded, saying nothing more. Yet within his heart, he resolved to uncover the truth and ensure Su Dan’s death was not in vain.

“Luo elder brother plans to go to the Blood Wolf Valley? Let us accompany you!” Mota spoke, his remaining moon-obsidian eye deepening as he recalled their earlier conversation about Luo Tian’s destination.

“Ah, they’re trying to get close,” Luo Tian instantly understood their intentions and gave a slight nod.

“Since you all wish to accompany me, I won’t refuse. Let us rest for a few days and depart three days later,” Luo Tian said softly. He had heard of the Blood Wolf Valley, knowing it held no great danger—only a creature called the blood wolf, of low rank. They could handle it without issue.

“Very well,” they said, rising and heading toward their former lodgings. Luo Tian saw them off, returning to his courtyard with a sorrowful expression. Friends had left, and beauty had faded.

“If she truly died, her soul should appear in the underworld. Unless it was scattered,” Luo Tian murmured softly, sensing Su Dan’s death was suspicious. He also felt Su Dan wasn’t so easily defeated; she had risen as an heir despite being a woman, her methods surpassing ordinary people.

The next morning, Luo Tian’s courtyard saw Luoshui standing there, his face carrying relief.

Noticing Luoshui’s arrival, Luo Tian hurried out, eyes filled with respect.

“I… must leave,” Luoshui spoke softly, causing Luo Tian’s body to tremble slightly.

“Are you uncomfortable staying? Perhaps I should find another place for you?” Luo Tian spoke gently, unwilling to let Luoshui risk his life in the Gate of Death.

“My brothers are all there. Take care, I’ll follow Master Wu Mian back to the Gate of Death today. Remember to inform me when you reach the Demon King’s city!” Luoshui said, his gaze turning hostile.

“Understood. Be safe,” Luo Tian nodded, urging him carefully. Though the Gate of Death seemed calm now, Luo Tian felt the Eight Demon Gates would soon face upheaval. The Underworld and Immortal Realm would surely clash, with the Eight Demon Gates at the forefront.

“Rest easy,” Luoshui patted Luo Tian’s shoulder before leaving his courtyard, following Wu Mian waiting nearby. The Wheel of Transcendence fell silent again. Luo Tian didn’t leave the Wheel of Transcendence, though the Blood Wolf Valley wasn’t dangerous—preparations were still needed.

Before three days passed, a message reached the Wheel of Transcendence, sending it into chaos.

On the very night the Demon King returned to his city, he passed his throne to his adopted son, Wang Mitian.

“Has the Demon King gone mad? Giving the throne to an adoptee? The throne isn’t meant for non-blood relatives!”

“Who is this Wang Mitian? I’ve never heard of him. Is the Demon King no longer capable?”

The disciples of the Wheel of Transcendence murmured.

“Who is this Wang Mitian?” Wang Gang and Mota also received the news, feeling the Demon King’s lineage had declined.

“Something’s off. The Demon King was injured—perhaps he was overthrown!”

“This Wang Mitian isn’t simple; he must have planned this for a long time. The Demon King’s injury was the opportunity!” Many speculated, but none knew the truth.

Soon, Wang Mitian’s name spread rapidly through the Underworld.

On the third day, Luo Tian and his group gathered to head for the Blood Wolf Valley. As for Wang Mitian, they didn’t take it seriously.

“Let’s go. Thank you all for accompanying me!” Luo Tian leapt into the air, six people forming six streaks of light flying westward from the Wheel of Transcendence.

The Blood Wolf Mountain lay millions of miles beyond the Wheel of Transcendence, spanning tens of thousands of square li, shrouded in blood-colored mist. Occasionally, wolf howls echoed through the valley, giving it its name: Blood Wolf Valley.

Luo Tian’s group landed at the valley’s edge, gazing at its endless expanse. They felt relaxed; they had heard of it before.

“Let’s treat this as a leisurely walk!” Wang Gang chuckled, stepping into the forest.

They smiled, walking through the woods. The blood mist enveloped the valley, and as they traversed it, no danger was found.

Time passed slowly. Night fell, and with it came darkness, especially the blood mist thickening, its bloody scent causing Luo Tian to frown slightly.

“This bloody scent often appears. No one knows where the mist originates,” Wang Gang, sensing Luo Tian’s discomfort, explained.

“Woo…” As Wang Gang’s words ended, a deep roar echoed from the valley’s depths, making their eyes narrow.

“Don’t worry. These blood wolves aren’t strong; they won’t harm us!” Qiu Long spoke loudly.

“Hoo…” But as Qiu Long’s words ended, a streak of blood lightning appeared in their vision.

“Get out…” Qiu Long roared, his body emitting a crackling sound.

“Crack…” A strange object, about a foot long, clung to Qiu Long’s body. It had blood-colored fur like steel needles, cold eyes, and gleaming white fangs, biting Qiu Long’s arm fiercely.

“What is this thing… a blood wolf?” Their faces showed shock.

They knew Qiu Long’s strength, yet they saw two blood marks on his arm. Qiu Long roared, throwing a fist at the blood wolf clinging to his arm. His massive fist struck the wolf’s head.

“Boom…” Blood splattered, and Qiu Long crushed the wolf with one punch, blood staining his body.

“These blood wolves have become so strong?” Wang Gang and the others were surprised, now cautious of their surroundings.

“Something’s wrong. Though this valley is famous and many ghost cultivators come seeking treasures, we’ve seen no living person since entering!” Mota said, his moon-obsidian eye scanning the blood mist.

Chapter 2488: Blood Sea

Blood-red light flickered faintly, clearly indicating Luo Tian’s group was surrounded by wolves. Yet, it seemed they hesitated to attack due to the aura on Luo Tian’s group or because of the previous companion crushed by Qiu Long. The blood mist thickened, and the wolves grew more ferocious, even making Luo Tian’s group feel a chill down their spines.

“These blood wolves seem controlled! Otherwise, they wouldn’t dare surround us. I’ve been here before; these wolves are much stronger than those I saw then!” Mota’s eyes flashed silver, his gaze turning to the distance.

“Many… countless blood wolves are gathering here!” Mota spoke again, causing Luo Tian’s group to exchange glances.

Gurgle… Gurgle… The sound of countless wolves echoed around them, making their gazes grow serious.

“Push forward! These wolves can’t stop us. Even if there are many, it’s useless!” Qiu Long shouted, his body radiating a terrifying aura.

“Correct. Our six realms combined can definitely crush them!” Wang Gang’s face showed confidence, a black realm expanding to envelop the group.

Hearing Wang Gang’s words, others also unleashed their realms. Six realms instantly surrounded them.

They were no longer the small kings they once were; entering the early stage of Immortal King, their strength had undergone a qualitative leap.

“Go…” Luo Tian spoke, standing at the front. After all, these people came with him.

“Hoo…” As Luo Tian’s group moved, a series of howls erupted. Blood-colored figures rushed toward them.

“Annihilate!” As the figures entered their realms, Luo Tian’s group began slaughtering the blood wolves.

Within thousands of feet, six layers of realms formed around Luo Tian’s group. Blood wolves couldn’t reach them. The six people became harvesters of blood wolves, advancing into the valley’s depths through piles of corpses.

“Why are these blood wolves so fearless?”

“I can’t see through this mist!” Mota said, having tried to pierce the blood mist since the beginning but only seeing up to a thousand feet.

“What’s going on? What happened in this Blood Wolf Valley?” They wondered. If there were major changes, they should have heard.

“Let’s go check. Maybe something extraordinary has emerged!” Wang Gang said, now bold due to their high strength.

They pushed forward, slaughtering countless blood wolves until the wolves gradually retreated. The forest grew quiet again, and the bloody scent thickened, making Luo Tian feel the air had become sticky.

After half an hour of walking, they finally found the source of the mist.

At this point, Luo Tian’s group had reached the valley’s depths. The surroundings were silent, and their eyes saw the earth split open, spewing out a torrent of blood mist.

A vast fissure stretched thousands of feet. The surrounding earth had turned crimson, giving a cold sensation.

“Where is the Soul-Recalling Grass?” Luo Tian looked around but found no sign of it.

“Be careful!”
“These blood mists seem to hide something strange!” Mota said, making their faces grim.

“Hoo…” As Mota’s words ended, the blood mist slowly coalesced into a ghostly figure, appearing before Luo Tian’s group. The figure’s face was blurred, but they could sense its formidable aura.

“Who are you? Why does a mere ghostly figure make me feel such a strong sense of danger!” Hong Tao’s eyes held fear.

A withered aura surged forth. The figure’s eyes flashed red, then it shattered with a thunderous explosion.

Boom…

The blood ghost disintegrated into countless streams of light, flying toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Blood demons! Don’t let them touch you!” Mota shouted, raising a barrier with his hands.

“Blood demons? How come there are such things here?” Luo Tian’s face turned serious, pointing his finger.

Boom… Boom… Each blood figure was annihilated by Luo Tian’s group, vanishing into the air.

Yet the number of blood demons was overwhelming. Their small bodies moved swiftly, and most importantly, they seemed unaffected by the realms, passing through them directly.

“How many are there?”

“If these things touch our bodies, they’ll merge with our blood. That would be troublesome!” Wang Gang said, clearly familiar with these demons.

“Boom…” Finally, Qiu Long was careless and was struck by a blood demon. A palm-sized demon touched Qiu Long’s body, instantly turning into blood that seeped through his pores.

“Damn it! Someone help me!” Qiu Long shouted. They could clearly see a red mark on his body, crawling.

“Buzz…” Black spear appeared; Luo Tian spun the Cracking Heaven Spear, forming a shield to block the blood demons’ attacks.

Seeing someone defending him, Qiu Long quickly activated his cultivation technique to expel the blood demon from his body.

After a hundred breaths, Qiu Long’s face turned red. He spat out a large amount of blood that landed on the ground. The blood immediately condensed, growing twice as big. This was due to the blood demon absorbing Qiu Long’s blood.

“This is only a short time, and it has grown twice as big. If we stay longer, even we could be drained of blood!” Hong Tao’s mouth twitched. He hadn’t expected to face such danger in a small Blood Wolf Valley.

“What should we do?”

“If we stay too long, we’ll have trouble!” Wang Gang looked at Luo Tian. They followed Luo Tian here to gain a favor, so they obeyed his decisions.

“Let’s not come in vain!” Luo Tian spoke softly and leapt into the vast fissure. Seeing Luo Tian enter, Wang Gang and others also rose, constantly attacking to prevent the endless blood demons from touching them.

Blood mist surged. Blood demons were annihilated by Luo Tian’s group, and they quickly rushed into the fissure.

When they entered, to their surprise, there were no blood demons inside—only the continuous flow of blood mist.

The powerful impact affected Luo Tian’s group, making their movements slow. Even they felt some strain.

“How deep is this?” Luo Tian frowned, looking at the blood-red stone walls as if they had been split open by something.

Time passed slowly. The powerful impact grew stronger, and the bloody scent continuously entered their bodies.

Cold air made Luo Tian’s face change. A sinister aura seemed to be eroding them, altering their wills. Blood threads slowly appeared in their eyes—Luo Tian was no exception. A wave of killing intent rose within him.

“Something’s wrong. We can’t go deeper. If we stay too long, being eroded by this aura will make us like those blood wolves outside!” They stopped, gazing at the abyss-like fissure shrouded in blood mist.

“What lies beneath?” They hesitated. Even Luo Tian did. They couldn’t see how long it would take to reach the bottom. Originally, they thought it was simple, but now faced such a situation.

“Let’s descend for another fifteen minutes. That should be our limit. If it doesn’t work, we’ll leave! Or you can leave on your own!” Luo Tian spoke to them and dove again.

“Okay,” Wang Gang and others nodded, diving down.

Ten feet… a thousand feet… ten thousand feet…

Time passed slowly. As Luo Tian was about to return, he finally broke through the blood mist.

Frenzied aura spread from their bodies. Their eyes were all red.

“What is this…” Wang Gang spoke, gazing at the scene before them. Blood Sea…

An endless blood sea appeared in their view. Though calm, it exuded an eerie aura, same as the one eroding them.

“Things that are out of the ordinary often hide something extraordinary. Perhaps this place contains a remarkable secret!” Mota said, pointing his finger. On the blood sea, there was an island barely visible unless one looked closely.

“This blood sea’s aura… why does it feel familiar?” Luo Tian gazed at the endless blood sea, murmuring to himself but couldn’t recall where he had seen it before.

“Let’s go check that island. We can’t stay here too long. Although this place is less sinister than before, staying too long will surely be hard to endure.” Six people formed a streak of light, rushing toward the blood island.

After a hundred breaths, they arrived at the island’s summit. The island had no life, with a bronze palace standing on it.

They landed before the palace, gazing at the bronze structure. It exuded a decayed aura, with green copper rust on its surface, giving it an ancient feel.

“Blood Sword Sect!” Though rusted, the characters “Blood Sword Sect” were still visible.

“Was this place called the Blood Sword Sect?”
“We’ve never had sects in the Underworld. Could it be a sect from the Immortal Realm?” Qiu Long’s eyes showed confusion.

“There is another possibility. It might date back to the ancient times before the Great Cataclysm!” Wang Gang’s eyes glowed with excitement, gazing at the rusted palace.

Chapter 2489: Blood Demon Ancestor

“Ancient times?” Hearing Wang Gang’s words, their eyes brightened. Anything connected to the ancient times was bound to be extraordinary. Especially something that had endured until now.

“Let’s go in!” They no longer wanted to leave but wished to check if there was anything valuable.

“Creak…” They pushed open the heavy palace door, and a decayed scent immediately filled the air. As they entered the hall, oil lamps around it slowly lit up.

The hall exuded a soul-like resonance. Dense blood qi roamed within, and numerous withered corpses appeared in Luo Tian’s group’s view. In the center of the hall stood a bronze altar, with a blood-colored long sword hovering above it. A powerful aura radiated from the sword, spreading outward.

“Hoo…” As Luo Tian’s group was stunned, the withered corpses on the ground stood up, their hollow eyes opening. Red glows flickered within them, and a deep rumbling sound echoed from their bodies.

“This sword is sentient!” Wang Gang’s group spoke in unison, instantly sensing the sword’s might.

As they were stunned, a blood-colored ghost appeared and grasped the blood-colored long sword. It was the same ghost that had appeared in the fissure, its eyes filled with brutality.

As the ghost grasped the long sword, it suddenly expanded violently. A sinister blade aura radiated outward, spreading a terrifying might and slicing downward.

“Indeed, it’s sentient. It must be an artifact spirit! After countless years, it has grown to this level!” Luo Tian held the Cracking Heaven Spear in both hands and met the sky-shattering blade aura.

“Crack…” The collision echoed within the hall. Luo Tian’s body was violently pushed back, his eyes filled with shock.

“Strong!” Wang Gang and the others also exclaimed in surprise. They knew Luo Tian’s strength, yet he had been pushed back by a single strike.

Blood trickled from his palm onto the Cracking Heaven Spear. Luo Tian’s eyes also turned serious.

“Hoo…” As Luo Tian retreated, the withered corpses rushed toward them. Hundreds of them, each incredibly powerful.

“Rattle…” As the ghost appeared, the blood sea outside the bronze hall violently surged, creating a towering wave that submerged the entire bronze hall.

The blood sea poured in, and the hall’s blood sea began to fade, gradually condensing.

“After so many years, it’s about time. Today I’ll finish you!” The blood ghost spoke within the hall, watching Luo Tian’s group battle the corpses with a smile.

“From now on, this blood sword soul is no longer mine!”

“These years, I’ve finally found a suitable body!” The ghost spoke, its voice cold.

Boom… Boom…

Luo Tian swept his Cracking Heaven Spear, repelling the corpses that surrounded him. He was amazed by their strength.

“These corpses… how are they so strong?” Qiu Long shouted, his body generating a powerful aura. He clashed with each corpse but even his physical strength couldn’t harm them.

“The ghost hasn’t attacked yet. If it does, we won’t be able to withstand it!” Wang Gang said, slicing a corpse’s body with his sword. A wound appeared but healed instantly.

“Let’s bring out our true strength. If we keep this up, we might end up trapped here!” Mo Ta switched to his right-hand sword. His moon-obsidian eye flashed with silver light, and he moved like lightning. His blade flowed into countless afterimages, black light flashing as he sliced off a corpse’s head.

“Crack…” The sound of breaking echoed. That corpse’s head was severed and rolled far away. As the head fell, the corpse seemed to lose control, collapsing into dust that vanished from Luo Tian’s group’s sight.

Red light flickered. A red stone-like object fell to the ground, cracking and emitting a surge of vitality. A small green grass sprouted from the stone’s crack.

“Soul-Recalling Grass!” Luo Tian’s eyes immediately recognized the plant, confirming it was what he needed.

“One strike to kill. Severing the head can destroy them!” They instantly understood and ceased holding back, unleashing powerful martial arts.

Their strength was formidable. Though these corpses were troublesome, they could still eliminate them.

“Squeak…” After an hour, many of the corpses in the hall were eliminated. Finally, Mo Er was injured. He hadn’t been careful enough and was scratched on the chest by a corpse, leaving a claw mark that carried corrosive intent. Mo Er’s face changed.

A red glow rose, entering Mo Er’s body through the wound. The corpse exploded, but this time no blood crystal emerged.

As the red glow appeared, Mo Er’s expression turned strange. His eyes gradually showed coldness, his face pale, and his black hair withered and dried.

“Ah…” Mo Er roared. His body’s veins bulged, his face showing pain. A savage aura radiated from him. The corpses didn’t attack Mo Er, but he looked at Luo Tian’s group with a sword in hand and rushed toward the nearest Hong Tao.

“What’s happening?” Hong Tao’s face changed. He hadn’t expected Mo Er, who had a decayed aura, to suddenly attack.

“Crack…” Luo Tian swept a corpse’s head with his spear and looked at Mo Er, who had gone mad and was attacking Hong Tao.

Fortunately, Hong Tao’s speed was extraordinary. He continuously evaded Mo Er’s attacks and wasn’t harmed.

“Don’t get injured! If you do, you’ll be infected!” Wang Gang shouted. They were all strong warriors who had encountered corpses before but never faced such corpses.

“How can we not get injured!” Their faces looked grim. No one could guarantee they wouldn’t be harmed in this situation, especially with Mo Er’s attacks making Hong Tao sweat and nearly get cut several times. If it continued, they would definitely be injured.

“Soul Storage!” Mo Ta’s hands formed a seal and unleashed it, a martial art he had stolen from Yang Huanyu.

Boom… A coffin appeared with terrifying power, its lid opening. A black vortex rose from the coffin and directly targeted Mo Er.

“Hoo…” Mo Er roared, pulled into the coffin by the black vortex. A thunderous sound echoed within the coffin.

“Hurry and finish it! How long can we keep him sealed!” Mo Ta spoke, his silver moon-obsidian eye open. Tears of blood flowed down.

“An illusion?” The old ghost’s figure, however, showed contempt. It raised its blood-colored sword and slashed.

“Pf…” Mo Ta spat out a torrent of blood. “How could my illusion be broken by one strike!” Mo Ta spoke in disbelief, his eyes filled with surprise.

“Don’t show yourself yet. I’ll force you out myself!” The blood ghost looked at the blood water flowing into the hall and raised its sword, slashing toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Boom…” As the terrifying blood sword aura appeared, a ghostly figure emerged from the blood waves. It had no physical body but struck with one palm, colliding with the blood sword aura.

The next moment, the blood waves surged. The ghostly figure shattered, and the blood sword aura vanished like a cow entering the sea.

“Finally, after so many years, I’ve seen you!” The ghostly figure gazed at the blood water that had flooded the hall. The blood water gradually faded, and a figure in blood-colored robes appeared within the hall. His aura was terrifying.

“Who are you!” Seeing this blood-robed elder, the blood sword ghost’s face instantly darkened.

“Not the Blood Demon Ancestor!” The ghost shouted again, slashing toward the blood-robed elder with its sword.

“After so many years, you’ve taken advantage of my time in the sea to absorb my cultivation. You’ve become powerful!” The blood-robed elder spoke coldly and pointed his finger.

“Boom…” The blood sword aura shattered in the hall, scattering into divine laws that spread across eight directions.

“Who are you!” The ghost shouted again, slashing toward the blood-robed elder.

“My name is… Tu Tian!” A solemn voice echoed through the hall. The blood-robed elder extended his hand, and the blood sea surged. A massive blood hand formed and directly grabbed the sky-shattering sword aura.

“Burst…” The next moment, the blood hand caught the sword aura. That sword aura which had pushed Luo Tian back was shattered by the blood hand.

“Tu Tian!”

“Who is he? Why have we never heard of such a powerful figure!” Wang Gang and the others were shocked, gazing at the arrogant blood-robed figure.

“You haven’t fully awakened yet. You can only use the strength of an early Immortal King now. If I go all out, you won’t be my match!” The ghost shouted, fear in his eyes. His illusory body vanished and merged into the blood sword.

“Buzz…” The blood sword flickered with an eerie light, flying from the altar as a streak of light toward Tu Tian.

“Immortal battles!” Wang Gang and others looked grim, their hearts aching. They hadn’t expected to face such danger just by entering the Blood Wolf Valley.

“Tu Tian!” Luo Tian murmured softly, feeling he had heard this name before. At the same time, their battle was nearly over. The corpses were shattered into red crystals with a Soul-Recalling Grass growing on them.

Chapter 2490: Blood Sword

Within the bronze hall, the blood sword continuously slashed. The figure in blood-colored robes also fought back, clashing with the blood sword. The hall echoed constantly.

Luo Tian’s group stood in a corner, watching one against one, their eyes filled with admiration.

“I didn’t expect such a powerful figure to appear suddenly. Though he radiates the aura of an early Immortal King, I feel he is stronger than any early Immortal King I’ve seen!” Mota said, gazing at Tu Tian and the blood sword.

“Boom…” The black coffin continuously emitted thunderous sounds, drawing their attention to it.

“What about Mo Er?” Qiu Long asked, causing them to fall silent.

“Regardless, we must open the coffin first and see how to save him!” Luo Tian spoke to Mota. Mo Er had come with him, and he couldn’t let Mo Er be harmed.

Without Mota’s incantation, the black seals on the coffin began to break. Green hair sprouted from the coffin.

“Boom…” Finally, the black coffin shattered with a thunderous sound. A green-haired monster burst out of the coffin.

“Is this Mo Er?” Their faces showed disbelief, gazing at the creature emerging from the coffin.

It had green hair and two red eyes emitting a savage aura. It held a long sword in its hand, its face devoid of color as if drained of blood.

“His body contains a Soul-Recalling Grass, and the red crystal is also inside his corpse!” Mota said, eyes filled with shock. This was their first time witnessing such a phenomenon.

“How do we get it out? Can’t we just kill him?” Others frowned, looking at Luo Tian.

“Hoo…” But Mo Er didn’t care about Luo Tian’s group. His green hair grew rapidly, sweeping toward them.

“Buzz…” Wang Gang swung his long sword, cutting through the green hair. But it was useless; they couldn’t cut it all.

“What is this thing?” Others also unleashed their attacks, at least to subdue Mo Er first before restoring him.

Storms raged. Luo Tian swung his Cracking Heaven Spear, fiercely chopping the rapidly growing green hair.

“Boom…” Qiu Long punched, striking Mo Er’s body and pushing him back. Though Mo Er had changed much, they could still subdue him with their strength.

After a incense stick’s worth of time, five people held Mo Er down by his head and limbs. He roared but couldn’t break free.

“What should we do?” They stared at each other, unsure how to handle Mo Er. They didn’t know how to remove this thing.

“We can’t stay too long. Let’s return to the Wheel of Transcendence and have the Black and White Yama examine it!”
“I feel this thing, if we stay too long, might turn Mo Er into a monster!” Wang Gang said.

“Let’s go. We’ve obtained the Soul-Recalling Grass, so we can leave!” Luo Tian spoke to them. He knew this blood sword wasn’t something he could touch.

They each cast divine patterns, sealing Mo Er. They rose and rushed out of the bronze hall.

Tu Tian radiated a sinister aura. Though Luo Tian felt familiar with him, he didn’t know who he was.

“Okay,” others nodded in agreement. They knew this blood-robed elder was someone they couldn’t provoke; it was his territory.

“Boom…” As they wanted to leave the bronze hall, the battle between one and one reached its climax.

“Blood War Across Eight Directions!” Tu Tian roared, transforming into a sea of blood. He instantly became eight blood figures, his hands swirling. Eight snow-white dragons wrapped around the blood sword.

“I am the Blood Sword, a weapon of the Blood Demon Ancestor. You, a mere early Immortal King, dare to possess me? You’re unworthy!” The blood sword spirit’s voice was arrogant and mad.

“Buzz…” A terrifying aura emerged from the blood sword, carrying a powerful suppression. The moment they reached the hall’s entrance, Luo Tian’s group’s faces changed.

Even Tu Tian’s gaze showed shock, sensing the suppression from the blood sword he had wrapped with eight dragons.

“World Power!” Luo Tian’s group all exclaimed, eyes filled with shock.

“This blood sword isn’t a supreme immortal artifact. It possesses a fragment of world power! Though it’s not as strong as the world treasures born from the World Heart, it is far stronger than ordinary supreme immortal artifacts!” Everyone’s eyes showed shock. They hadn’t expected to encounter such a treasure.

Boom…

The sword aura expanded violently, radiating an apocalyptic aura. The sound alone made the entire hall tremble.

“Blood Sea Burn Heaven!” Tu Tian shouted, his eight blood figures merging. He performed hand signs, rapidly moving his hands to summon blood shields before him.

“Today I’ll kill you and make you the food of the Blood Sword!” The blood sword spirit’s mad voice echoed. The red blade slashed downward.

Terror spread, paralyzing Luo Tian’s group. Under this pressure, they couldn’t even resist.

In an instant, the blood sword slashed against Tu Tian’s blood shields. Each shield was instantly destroyed by the blood sword.

“Rattle…” The blood sea surged, and Tu Tian’s face changed. He raised his hands, transforming them into two sharp swords to meet the sky-shattering blood sword.
