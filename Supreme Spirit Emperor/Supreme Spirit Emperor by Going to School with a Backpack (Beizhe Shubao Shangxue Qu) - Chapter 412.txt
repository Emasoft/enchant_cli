Seeing the greedy glances of the crowd, the three-headed dog clearly understood their words. It took two steps back in fear, its massive body vanishing into the darkness, leaving only six silver eyes visible.

“Well! Since you chose to follow me, I won’t take advantage of you!” Luo Tian nodded. This was a free gain; if Luo Tian didn’t seize it, he’d be a fool.

The three-headed dog’s power was evident to all. Capturing it would surely be a formidable aid. Moreover, this three-headed dog was cultivated by an immortal, clearly no ordinary beast. With such strength and still not transformed into human form, there must be some hidden truth.

“Grrr…” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the three-headed dog growled and stepped out of the darkness toward Luo Tian. As it ran, its body gradually shrank to normal size, though its three heads remained strikingly noticeable.

The three-headed dog transformed into a black lightning bolt, instantly appearing before Luo Tian. It lunged forward with its jaws, biting into Luo Tian’s arm. Its fangs pierced Luo Tian’s flesh, spewing golden divine blood from his arm.

“Luo Tian!” The crowd watched Luo Tian injured again, their faces darkening. They were about to act when Luo Tian stopped them.

“Nothing’s wrong!” Luo Tian shook his head gently, blocking their actions with a smile on his face.

At first, Luo Tian was surprised, but then he noticed his blood had stained the three-headed dog’s collar. The crimson symbols formed and vanished into the collar.

As the blood symbols disappeared, Luo Tian felt an inexplicable connection with the three-headed dog—like master and servant, but more like the contract he had once made with Dragon Baby.

“Grrr…” The three heads of the three-headed dog growled at Luo Tian, sending waves of thoughts into his mind, shaking his spirit.

“Alright, now I am your master. I won’t treat you like your previous master did!” Luo Tian lightly patted the middle head of the three-headed dog, smiling.

“Whine…” The three-headed dog let out a series of whines, rubbing its three large heads against Luo Tian’s thighs in affection.

“Tell me your origin. Why haven’t you transformed yet?” Luo Tian then asked the three-headed dog, his gaze filled with curiosity.

“Woof…” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the three heads of the three-headed dog barked repeatedly. At the same time, waves of thoughts flooded into Luo Tian’s mind, revealing the three-headed dog’s past.

In fact, the three-headed dog didn’t know where it came from. It had lived in the White Bone Palace since it gained consciousness, and that immortal was its master. The collar around its neck was the immortal’s creation; if it disobeyed, the collar would choke it.

The reason the three-headed dog hadn’t transformed was because it was still in its juvenile stage, not yet mature.

“My god!” Diao Dezhu could understand the three-headed dog’s words, his face showing disbelief as he gazed at the three-headed dog now reduced to normal size.

“Juvenile… juvenile…” Luo Tian’s eyes also showed disbelief as he stared at the large black dog that had shrunk to his waist level, unable to help but exclaim.

Chapter 1621: Immortal Bone

“What did you say?” Zheng Xin and the others looked at Luo Tian with confusion, as if they hadn’t heard clearly.

“This three-headed dog is still in its juvenile stage, so it can’t transform into human form…” Luo Tian looked at the three-headed dog that had seemingly turned into a regular black dog, speaking to the crowd.

“Damn!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the crowd’s expressions turned vivid, all eyes turning to the three-headed dog.

Seeing them looking at him, the three heads of the three-headed dog immediately lifted high, eyes filled with pride.

“This juvenile is already comparable to a Provisional Epoch Lord! Imagine how terrifying it would be when it matures!” The crowd gazed at the three-headed dog, as if seeing a rare treasure.

“He said this world suppressed him. If he were in the Immortal Realm, his strength would be comparable to an Immortal Lord!” Luo Tian spoke softly, a hint of confusion in his eyes.

“What is an Immortal Lord?” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the people became confused again. They had never heard of such a realm, obviously belonging to the Immortal Realm, which they didn’t know about.

“He doesn’t know either. It’s something he was born with!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly, unsure of how powerful an Immortal Lord truly was. However, in Luo Tian’s view, it must be far stronger than the Epoch Lords, as it was an Immortal Realm level.

“Immortal Lord…” The crowd looked at the three-headed dog with a sense of helplessness, their hearts bitter.

“Truly, it’s better to be alive than a dog!” Zheng Xin and Xu Lizi yi felt disheartened.

“Same dog, yet the difference is so vast! Dogzhi, don’t you feel ashamed?” The crowd then turned their attention to Diao Dezhu.

“Shut up! Don’t blame everything on me! If I had one like this, I’d rather be a dog!” Diao Dezhu cursed at them.

“Alright, we should leave now,” Luo Tian sighed deeply, a smile on his face.

“But, we seem to have forgotten someone—Run Hongyu! How is he?” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s intention to leave, the crowd felt happy. They had grown tired of staying in the White Bone Palace.

“Uh…” Upon hearing their words, Luo Tian’s face slightly stiffened; he had indeed forgotten Run Hongyu. He then waved his hand, and Run Hongyu’s body appeared before them.

“Finally released!” As soon as he appeared, Run Hongyu looked at Luo Tian with a bitter smile.

“Master Hongyu, you’ve recovered? I’m sorry for the earlier incident; we had no choice but to seal you temporarily!” Luo Tian smiled and bowed.

The illusion was originally set up by the immortal. Now that he had devoured the immortal, the illusion naturally no longer existed. It was only natural for Run Hongyu to emerge from it.

“It’s fine; I actually caused you some trouble!” Run Hongyu looked apologetic, recalling his experiences in the White Bone Palace.

“Don’t mention it; without you, we wouldn’t have found this White Bone Forest. We still owe you gratitude!” Luo Tian spoke softly.

“Have you all resolved it?” Even though he had been sealed by Luo Tian, after regaining consciousness, Run Hongyu could still see what was happening outside. His eyes were filled with awe as he looked at the three-headed dog under Luo Tian’s feet.

“Yes, we’ll leave now,” Luo Tian nodded and gently patted the three-headed dog’s head. With the three-headed dog, finding the exit of the White Bone Palace wouldn’t be difficult.

“Grrr…” The three-headed dog growled, its body expanding again to its previous size of dozens of zhang. It lowered its head, eyes filled with servility, indicating Luo Tian to step on it.

Luo Tian smiled and pulled Sun Mengru up onto the three-headed dog’s large head. The three massive heads slowly lifted.

“Three-headed dog, let us get on too!” Diao Dezhu and the others looked at Luo Tian and Sun Mengru standing atop the three-headed dog with envy. The two seemed like a divine couple, especially with the three-headed dog beneath them, appearing unusually fierce and impressive.

“Grrr…” However, the three-headed dog stood up its heads proudly, eyes filled with arrogance, looking down on Diao Dezhu and the others. It turned into the darkness.

“Hurry up, follow!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed in the darkness.

“Damn it!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Diao Dezhu and the others cursed but didn’t dare to delay. Their figures moved swiftly toward the three-headed dog’s direction.

The massive body of the three-headed dog seemed like a black lightning bolt, moving through the darkness. If it weren’t for its six silver eyes emitting cold glints, no one would have noticed the three-headed dog’s presence.

“Damn it, this dog runs too fast!” Diao Dezhu and the others rushed desperately, using all their strength to keep up with the three-headed dog’s speed.

“Daring to cheat me, I’ll make you die of exhaustion!” Luo Tian’s face showed a hint of disdain. However, he was also amazed by the three-headed dog’s speed. If it hadn’t slowed down slightly, only Diao Dezhu and Zheng Xin would have been able to catch up.

The wind blew Luo Tian and Sun Mengru’s clothes, and the two stood comfortably atop the three-headed dog’s head. Their eyes constantly scanned around.

After running for a quarter of an hour, Luo Tian finally saw the glimmers of light. Almost instantly, his eyes felt stung by the brightness. From darkness to intense light, if it were anyone else, they would have been blinded immediately. Even Luo Tian felt slightly unaccustomed.

“Damn it, this dog is going to make me die of exhaustion!” Upon adapting, a string of curses echoed from behind. Luo Tian’s face showed a smile.

However, waves of energy then surged into Luo Tian’s body, causing his face to slightly change. His eyes showed intense joy.

Luo Tian looked at the source of the energy waves, his face instantly stunned. In his view stood an altar with a green hand bone placed on it. Waves of energy radiated from the bone, and that aura made Luo Tian feel unusually comfortable. However, the pressure on the bone was overwhelmingly strong; even Luo Tian felt a sense of pressure.

“Damn it, what is this thing!” Diao Dezhu and the others were about to continue cursing the three-headed dog but noticed something strange. Their faces showed shock as they gazed at the hand bone placed on the altar, resembling jade.

“Why does this single bone give me a feeling of being able to kill me!” Zheng Xin spoke in a trembling voice, fear lacing her tone.

“A great opportunity! If we collect this bone, whenever we face an enemy, just throw it out. Whoever gets hit will die!” Sun Kemin’s face showed greed as he moved swiftly toward the altar.

“Grrr…” However, as Sun Kemin took a step forward, the three-headed dog growled at him.

“Want to stop me? No way! Damn it, coming here to the White Bone Palace and getting nothing is too much of a loss!” Sun Kemin showed disdain, his face filled with arrogance. In front of treasures, he unleashed unprecedented speed and bypassed the three-headed dog to charge toward the altar.

“Sun Kemin, I’m here; you won’t succeed!” Zheng Xin roared and vanished in a whirlwind.

“Hey, Dogzhi, why didn’t you go?” Xu Lizi yi and the others looked at Diao Dezhu with confusion. Normally, Diao Dezhu would have rushed like Zheng Xin, but this time he surprised them.

“I’m not worthy to compete with them!” Diao Dezhu habitually boasted, crossing his arms and looking at Sun Kemin and Zheng Xin.

“Who believes that…” Upon hearing Diao Dezhu’s words, Xu Lizi yi and the others showed disdain. Their eyes turned to Sun Kemin and Zheng Xin.

Before they could see the two, two cries of pain echoed in their ears, making Diao Dezhu’s eyes show disdain.

“Good thing I could understand what that dog said; otherwise, I’d be as embarrassed as them!” Diao Dezhu felt relieved, watching Sun Kemin and Zheng Xin flying back like two meteors.

“Boom… boom…” Two heavy sounds echoed in Luo Tian’s group ears, and Sun Kemin and Zheng Xin appeared in their sight.

“Should…” The group felt secretly happy but also looked at the altar with awe, their eyes filled with shock.

In that instant, they felt a powerful wave directly throwing Sun Kemin and Zheng Xin away, leaving them unable to resist.

“Who’s bone is this? It’s so strong! Even the bones of the Celestial Emperor didn’t have such a powerful wave!” Luo Tian’s face also showed shock.

However, the three-headed dog’s low growl made Luo Tian’s eyes show intense surprise. He looked at the green hand bone.

“This is an Immortal Bone; the immortal was born within this hand bone!” Luo Tian whispered to himself, making Diao Dezhu’s group eyes also show intense shock.

“Our opportunity has come! This Immortal Bone contains power that can greatly enhance our strength!” Luo Tian spoke to the group, his voice filled with excitement. It was like a pillow being sent when one was sleepy—Luo Tian currently lacked something to improve his cultivation, and now a piece of Immortal Bone appeared.

“Don’t know if we can enter the Provisional Epoch Lord by refining this piece of Immortal Bone!” Diao Dezhu’s group faces also showed joy. They then sat cross-legged on the ground, activating their cultivation techniques to refine the energy radiating from the altar.

Chapter 1622: Exit the Bone Palace

On the vast altar, the green hand bone hovered there. A powerful aura radiated from it, with divine laws flowing around it and misty vapor continuously dispersing.

A strong suction constantly absorbed the misty vapor from the hand bone, directing it in various directions into the bodies of Luo Tian and his group.

The sound of thunder continuously rose within their bodies, and their auras steadily increased. If someone saw their state, they would be very surprised; their strength was rapidly enhancing.

The black three-headed dog lay before Luo Tian, its six eyes lazy and sleepy, resembling a large black dog. Its eyes showed dependency, feeling it had chosen the right master—Luo Tian didn’t punish it but was much stronger than others.

The three-headed dog looked at the waterfall-like energy pouring from Luo Tian’s head and then at the whirlwinds on others’ heads. Its six silver eyes showed disdain.

Time slowly passed, and as Luo Tian’s group enhanced their strength, the Nine Realms also experienced changes. The Ancient Kings had been stirring for a long time and finally took some small actions. Friction occurred at the entrances of Lei Realm and冥 Realm (Nether Realm).

Sometimes, strong figures from the Ancient Kings tried to break out of their realms but were killed by human realm’s strength. Though many were killed, people knew this was the prelude to a storm; future days would become increasingly difficult.

However, the human realm also had good news. The domain masters of each region emerged from seclusion. Long Jie, Zhou Wei, Yan Hongtao and others became Provisional Epoch Lords through the accumulation of holy sites.

Upon this news, people in the human realm felt encouraged. After all, the number of Provisional Kings on the Ancient King side was so overwhelming that it made people despair. Fortunately, there were three top-tier masters—Gu Tian Shu and Ji Jiu You—to hold the line, otherwise the human realm would have no time to catch its breath.

The human realm also knew that this was because the Ancient Kings’ masters were all drawn to the Immortal Burial Coffin, leaving no time for them to care about the human realm. The Ancient Kings’ strength must have also greatly improved, as they were originally much stronger than the human realm.

On another note, the alliance of realms in Star Luo had gradually expanded into a status like that of a holy clan. With the previous lesson from attacking the alliance, Star Luo’s people had no intention of continuing to attack it. They tacitly accepted the alliance's presence in Star Luo.

People of the Four Sacred Realms also gradually knew that all the alliance members were sects with hostile relationships to Luo Tian. This made people of the Four Sacred Realms feel uncomfortable, as if a piece of excrement was placed there. They wanted to step on it but feared soiling their shoes, yet not stepping on it was still repulsive.

However, the entire Nine Realms remained in a brief balance with no major movements. But if there was one spark, the entire Nine Realms would be ignited and could explode at any moment.

Time slowly passed as Luo Tian’s group sat cross-legged under the altar, absorbing for a month. Under their full absorption, the green hand bone gradually lost its luster and hovered on the altar.

“Not enough!” They all opened their eyes, exchanged glances, and with默契 (mutual understanding), stopped absorbing. Their gazes turned to Luo Tian.

“What are you looking at me for?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, confused by their meaning.

“I’ll use my own efforts to advance to the Provisional Epoch Lord!” Diao Dezhu showed confidence on his face, whispering.

“Luo Tian, you absorb it; becoming a Provisional Epoch Lord is your future and pillar. We’ve been here in the White Bone Palace for a long time, but we don’t know what’s happening outside. Are our enemies and the Ancient Kings entering Provisional Kings? If you become a Provisional Epoch Lord, you can push through everyone. We’ll rely on your tree in the future!” Zheng Xin’s face showed seriousness. At this critical moment, they could distinguish right from wrong.

“Yes, Luo Tian, don’t be polite! Hurry up and become a Provisional Epoch Lord. You’ve been in this realm long enough!” Xu Lizi yi and the others smiled, their eyes filled with anticipation. They thought of Luo Tian becoming a Provisional Epoch Lord and pushing through all enemies.

“Go on, don’t disappoint us!” Sun Mengru smiled and spoke to Luo Tian.

“Okay!” Luo Tian nodded, knowing they were right. He felt grateful and sat cross-legged again on the ground.

“If this still can’t make me a Provisional Epoch Lord, I’ll be sorry to everyone!” Luo Tian thought to himself. He was grateful for their support and then activated the Reincarnation Heaven Technique again, absorbing the energy radiating from the hand bone.

“Hum…” A golden whirlpool appeared above Luo Tian’s head, and the entire fourth level of the White Bone Palace trembled with his absorption.

“This变态 (pervert) was suppressing his absorption speed all along! If he had used this speed from the beginning, we wouldn’t have any chance!” The group looked at the whirlpool above Luo Tian’s head and showed shock.

“Boom… boom…” Thunderous sounds continuously echoed in Luo Tian’s dantian (cultivation core). Previously, he had absorbed the power of the Immortal Bone and expanded his Reincarnation Bridge to its limit. Now, he was absorbing again, aiming to transform the Reincarnation Bridge into a Reincarnation Passage. That way, he could fully become a Provisional Epoch Lord.

A stream of terrifying energy continuously gathered into Luo Tian’s body, and the golden Reincarnation Bridge expanded again in his dantian.

Outside, Diao Dezhu and the others showed excitement on their faces. They could feel Luo Tian’s aura growing at a terrifying rate, giving them a strong pressure.

“Don’t know how long it will take!” Diao Dezhu and the others, with nothing else to do, kept discussing.

“How long it takes doesn’t matter; it should be natural! After all, Luo Tian now only lacks cultivation. If he has the cultivation, he will definitely be a Provisional Epoch Lord!” They discussed among themselves and surrounded Luo Tian for a long wait.

Time slowly passed, another month had gone by. The floating Immortal Bone on the altar emitted a continuous hum and no longer radiated any energy, appearing like jade. However, its pressure was still overwhelmingly strong, making it impossible to approach.

“Boom…” But as Luo Tian absorbed, the bone seemed to lose its divine power and fell directly onto the massive altar with a thunderous sound.

“Boom… boom…” The massive altar immediately collapsed under the bone’s fall, turning into pieces of withered bones and vanishing from sight.

With the altar’s collapse, the entire hall shook, and withered bones fell down from the hall.

“Is this hall going to collapse?” The group’s faces slightly changed, and they合力 (combined forces) created a barrier to protect Luo Tian. They didn’t know what state Luo Tian was in; if he were interrupted at the critical moment, missing the chance to become a Provisional Epoch Lord would be too costly.

The thunderous sounds continued, and with each withered bone falling, the hall shook more violently.

“Crash…” After shaking for a quarter of an hour, the entire hall could no longer withstand it and collapsed with a thunderous sound.

Not only did the fourth level collapse, but the first three levels also fell with it. The entire White Bone Palace instantly turned into a pile of white bones, standing in the White Bone Forest.

“Boom…” A massive explosion echoed within the pile of white bones, golden light bursting out from the gaps. A powerful aura instantly spread throughout the White Bone Forest, radiating outward.

In an instant, the pile of white bones exploded again, and a golden figure shot up into the sky. His entire body radiated an astonishing aura, his long hair flying, and a powerful pressure emanated from the golden figure.

“Damn it, I finally came out; I was about to suffocate!” At the same time, Diao Dezhu and the others crawled out of the pile of bones, their faces showing excitement.

“Luo Tian…” They then saw Luo Tian standing in the sky, their faces showing great joy.

“I’ve become a Provisional Epoch Lord!” Luo Tian stood in the sky, his eyes sparkling. At this moment, he felt extremely powerful; his dantian contained a vast Reincarnation Passage, as if it had an endless supply of epoch power.

“Sigh, I hope I can quickly become a Provisional Epoch Lord too and go around showing off!” Diao Dezhu showed envy on his face, looking at Luo Tian who gave them a strong pressure.

“There will be such a day!” Luo Tian smiled and spoke to the group, as they were brothers in arms. Polite words weren’t necessary.

“Next, should we go deeper? Where is the exit of this White Bone Forest?” The group then turned their eyes to Luo Tian. Now that he was a Provisional Epoch Lord, the strongest in the Nine Realms, they believed no one could match Luo Tian except for Gu Tian Shu, Dongbo Xin, and Ji Jiu You. With his strength, he could go anywhere.

Upon hearing their words, Luo Tian looked into the depths of the White Bone Forest, his gaze deepened. Now that he had become a Provisional Epoch Lord, his vision had also risen significantly. He felt a special sense of danger.

“We should leave!” Luo Tian thought, and spoke to the group.

Chapter 1623: Exit the White Bone Forest

“Leave?” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, the group felt confused. Normally, after becoming a Provisional Epoch Lord, one would need to consolidate their cultivation and find a strong opponent. The White Bone Forest was one of the Nine Perilous Realms, an area that had almost wiped them out before. It was a perfect place to test their strength and might have better opportunities inside. Yet Luo Tian chose to leave.

“Master Hongyu, do you know the exit of this White Bone Forest?” Luo Tian looked at Run Hongyu without explaining why he wanted to leave.

“Don’t know…” Run Hongyu shook his head. He only knew how to enter but didn’t know how to exit.

“Shall we go deeper?” Sun Kemin asked with inquiry. After all, they had no other options now that there was no exit.

“No more depth; there’s a strange pressure inside, as if it were something forbidden. If I’m a Provisional Epoch Lord, we might still be wiped out!” Luo Tian shook his head gently. This pressure was invisible but something he could sense after becoming a Provisional Epoch Lord.

This aura made Luo Tian feel uneasy; it was something he couldn’t handle now. He didn’t want to risk the group.

“Hey… Sun Kemin, what are you doing?” The group then saw Sun Kemin constantly digging at the bones.

“Nothing, just looking for something!” Sun Kemin chuckled and continued digging.

“Damn it, I get it now! He’s looking for that bone!” The others realized and also rushed toward the pile of bones.

Luo Tian was speechless watching them dig, but he smiled without stopping them.

“Damn it, I know where it is! Why isn’t it there?” They dug for a quarter of an hour, flattening the pile of bones, but still couldn’t find the bone that had given them pressure.

“I won’t give up!” Sun Kemin gritted his teeth, a wild look in his eyes. He then waved his hands, and the Treasure Gathering Basin appeared on his hand.

“Hum…” A humming sound came from the Treasure Gathering Basin, and then the withered bones under their feet began to make a sound, as if they were gathering toward the basin.

“Sun Kemin, stop!” Luo Tian’s face slightly changed as he felt the terrifying pressure from deep within the White Bone Forest stirring.

Then, Luo Tian waved his hand and a golden hand appeared instantly, slamming onto the Treasure Gathering Basin in front of Sun Kemin.

“Boom…” The golden Treasure Gathering Basin exploded under Luo Tian’s casual slap, turning into a gust of wind that hit the group.

“My god! This is Luo Tian’s current strength; a casual slap wiped out Sun Kemin’s technique!” The group showed shock. Though they had some mental preparation, they were still stunned by Luo Tian’s power.

After the Treasure Gathering Basin disappeared, Luo Tian also felt the stirring pressure that had made him uneasy subside.

“Woof… woof…” The three-headed dog barked at the group, drawing their attention to itself.

“My god!” They then saw the three-headed dog’s mouth holding a green hand bone, swaying it before Luo Tian as if showing off.

“Hard work!” Luo Tian smiled and took the hand bone from the three-headed dog’s mouth. He then felt it was heavy.

“Good thing!” Luo Tian couldn’t help but speak softly. If he used epoch power to attack with this bone, it would be no less than an Epoch Treasure. Perhaps even stronger if used properly.

“Luo Tian, you’ve been tricking us all along! This bone was already found by this dog, right!” Seeing the Immortal Bone in Luo Tian’s hand, Diao Dezhu and the others felt their teeth grit. They had dug for half a day, but got nothing.

“Don’t argue; let’s go!” Luo Tian ignored their words and shifted the group's attention, speaking softly.

“Let’s try the teleportation array!” Luo Tian shook his head lightly and looked at Wan Lingkong. He wouldn’t go deeper.

“Okay!” Wan Lingkong waved his hand, and the stone wall where he had previously set up the teleportation array collapsed into view.

“Works!” Wan Lingkong’s face showed great joy, looking at the waves from the array flags and confirming that the teleportation array could be activated.

“Let’s go, try it…” Luo Tian nodded, though he felt the teleportation array was somewhat unreliable.

“I don’t want to sit…” Xu Lizi yi shook his head, still upset about being sent to the Dragon Killing Valley by Wan Lingkong’s teleportation array before, where he had stayed for years.

“Don’t worry; this time it should be fine!” Wan Lingkong looked at the group with a hint of unease.

“What do you mean ‘should’?” Diao Dezhu immediately caught the lack of confidence in Wan Lingkong’s words, his face showing confusion.

“Let’s go; no matter where we end up, it’ll be better than staying in the White Bone Forest!” Luo Tian spoke softly.

“By the way, this is a perilous realm; if we get sent to the wrong place, don’t blame me!” Wan Lingkong revealed his true intention, making the group more worried.

“Go…” Luo Tian didn’t continue talking and stepped onto the teleportation array first, followed by Sun Mengru and Diao Dezhu.

“Go!” Wan Lingkong shouted, then inserted the main array flag into the stone wall. The teleportation power immediately took effect on them.

“Hum…” In an instant, Luo Tian and the group vanished from the White Bone Forest, leaving a stone wall behind with golden array flags inserted into it.

…

Under the blood-colored starry sky, waves of energy spread out. A white-cloaked Luo Tian appeared under the stars, gazing at the empty surroundings. A black dog stood beside him.

“Damn it, this is definitely unreliable!” Luo Tian looked around and saw no one else except the three-headed dog. His face turned grim.

“No one is here! Where did they go?” Luo Tian muttered, taking out his identity token to try contacting Sun Mengru and others.

“Damn it, Wan Lingkong! I’ll skin you when I find you!” Xu Lizi yi’s cursing voice echoed from the identity token.

“Where are you?” Luo Tian heard the voice in the identity token and smiled.

“Luo Tian, I and Dogzhi were sent to a continent in the Shura Realm. Damn it, it’s really stinky! That bastard Wan Lingkong sent us to a pit!” Xu Lizi yi’s voice echoed from the identity token, making Luo Tian’s mouth twitch.

Luo Tian then tried contacting others and his face slightly changed, as he couldn’t contact anyone!

The only reason he couldn’t connect with the group was that they weren’t in the Shura Realm. Wan Lingkong’s location was in the Shura Realm, which made Luo Tian worry.

“Hope they weren’t sent to a perilous realm!” Luo Tian, now an Epoch Lord, had traversed the Nine Perilous Realms. He could feel that the Nine Perilous Realms were no ordinary places, perhaps concealing some terrifying forbidden entities.

“Where are you two? I’m waiting for you at the entrance of the Shura Realm!” Luo Tian spoke into the identity token and didn’t plan to go to the Shura City. Even if he wanted to, he couldn’t find it now.

After contacting Xu Lizi yi, Luo Tian’s figure flickered and vanished under the blood-colored starry sky. He instantly appeared at the direction of the Shura Realm and the Divine Beast Realm.

Luo Tian stood under the blood-colored starry sky, waiting for Diao Dezhu and Xu Lizi yi. Then the identity token echoed a furious voice.

“Luo Tian! Where are you?” Upon hearing this voice, Luo Tian’s face stiffened. His mouth showed a bitter smile.

“I almost forgot about him…” Luo Tian smiled slightly, the voice wasn’t anyone else but Yao Chen, who had separated from Luo Tian after entering the Shura Realm.

“Senior Brother, I’m at the entrance of the Shura Realm!” Luo Tian replied and felt his head hurt. If Yao Chen knew they hadn’t informed him about entering the White Bone Forest, he would be furious.

“Wait for me!” Yao Chen’s voice echoed and didn’t wait for Luo Tian to respond. He immediately closed the identity token.

Waves of energy echoed under the starry sky, and two streams of light flashed through the blood-colored stars. They instantly appeared before Luo Tian—Xu Lizi yi and Diao Dezhu.

Their faces clearly showed discomfort. Luo Tian smiled at them, though they had changed into clean clothes, he could imagine the feeling of being sent to a pit. He secretly felt lucky.

“Damn it, Wan Lingkong that bastard! I’ll never meet him again!” Xu Lizi yi and Diao Dezhu gritted their teeth. Though they had cleaned up, they still felt a strange odor on themselves.

“Alright, you two are better than them. Now we can’t contact anyone else; I don’t know how they’re doing!” Luo Tian sighed and spoke to them.

“Hmph…” The three-headed dog wrinkled its nose, obviously sensing the stench on them.

“Damn it, this dog’s nose is even more sensitive than Dogzhi’s!” Seeing the three-headed dog’s expression of disgust, Xu Lizi yi couldn’t help but curse.

“Luo Tian…” As Diao Dezhu was about to retaliate, a bold voice echoed. Golden light appeared in Luo Tian’s group's sight.

“Hum…” Before Diao Dezhu and Xu Lizi yi could react, a golden staff smashed through the stars, striking Luo Tian fiercely.

Chapter 1624: Sparring
