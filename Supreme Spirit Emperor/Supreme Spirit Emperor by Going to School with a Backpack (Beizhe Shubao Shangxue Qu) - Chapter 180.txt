“Even a Sage? A single finger of yours dares to kill me? Dream on!” Nangong Yuqing’s face bore a chill, as he too slashed his first blade.

The black demonic sword cleaved through the void, radiating a thunderous might as it hurtled toward the golden finger that had transformed into a mountain.

The collision erupted with a deafening roar, stars shattered, and two blades of light instantly clashed beneath the mountain-like golden finger.

Yet, the Seven Demonic Blades that had slain nine sources proved feeble before the golden finger. Like children, they were crushed and dissolved into dark energy, ultimately purified by the light radiating from the finger.

“Second strike!” Luo Tian and Nangong Yuqing knew their first strike would fail. As they unleashed the second, it struck the descending finger—but met the same crushing fate.

“Third strike!” Their eyes turned pitch-black, as if corrupted by some force. Veins bulged on their arms, and two massive blades of light erupted from their hands, radiating apocalyptic power.

The third strike of the Seven Demonic Blades was their limit. To unleash a fourth would demand unbearable sacrifice.

“Indeed, these two are formidable. This technique’s power is truly transcendent,” people marveled, watching the two blades shatter the void and appear before the golden finger.

Chapter 834: The End of the Sect War

Beneath the stars, two black blades and a golden mountain-like finger collided under the reverent gaze of onlookers.

“Boom…!” Black lightning crackled, as if tearing open the heavens. A terrifying surge surged toward Luo Tian and Nangong Yuqing.

“Failed to block!” Their black eyes narrowed, a sigh of admiration in their hearts.

“This still won’t work,” Luo Tian marveled, stunned that even their ultimate strike could not halt the single finger.

“A Sage transcends all beings. Before a Sage, even Transcendents are but ants. In the universe, Sages are rare. What are you two?” Jin Yongsi sneered, watching the golden finger descend.

“Three strikes were our limit. To stop it, we must unleash a fourth—but the cost is great,” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed madness. He gripped his demonic sword; without the fourth strike, he and Nangong Yuqing would perish.

Nangong Yuqing felt the same. His body trembled with thunderous roars. Luo Tian had reasons to live; so did he. To grasp even a sliver of hope, they had no choice but to fight with all their might.

Their aura surged skyward, hair flying like banners of kings.

“Fourth strike of the Seven Demonic Blades!” Their voices echoed in unison beneath the silent stars.

“Crack…!” Their bodies emitted a cacophony of fractures, cracks spreading across their forms as if one touch would shatter them.

The blade descended with a roar, the wind howled, and two blades of light—siphoning their very essence—flew forth.

“Boom…” At the moment the blades struck, Luo Tian and Nangong Yuqing’s swords shattered into dark energy, dispersing before them.

“Victory lies in this strike!” Luo Tian smiled, exchanging a glance with Nangong Yuqing. In each other’s eyes, they saw resolve.

At their weakest, their bodies bore wounds that worsened with each passing moment. Yet they stood, sustained by sheer will.

Though near exhaustion, their blades’ power rivaled the golden finger’s diminished strength. Two black blades struck in tandem with the golden finger, unleashing another thunderous roar that shook the void. The onlookers and disciples trembled; even至尊 (Supreme) level disciples spat blood.

“Boom…!” Black lightning coalesced into a vast sea beneath the stars, forming a swirling vortex. A powerful suction devoured corpses and flesh, drawing them into the void toward unknown reaches of the cosmos.

Luo Tian and Nangong Yuqing fought with their last breath, shattering the golden finger into radiant gold shards that scattered like stars.

“Blocked! Ha!” The Tianyuan Sect disciples felt relief, laughing wildly as they gazed at Luo Tian and Nangong Yuqing with reverence.

Jiang Sixi lightened, exhaling deeply as she rushed to Luo Tian’s side, supporting him. Her essence flowed into his back.

Lin Yangzhi did the same for Nangong Yuqing, though he had countless questions. He knew now was not the time.

“You’ve been marked by the Divine Race. They have matters to attend; you’ll face their retaliation,” Jin Yongsi’s voice echoed.

“Fled!” Luo Tian sighed, stunned that Jin Yongsi had escaped.

“That old man no longer threatens us,” Nangong Yuqing’s face regained color, dismissing Jin Yongsi with indifference.

“True, but being hunted by a Nine Sources is no joy. He might bite you anytime,” Luo Tian mused, knowing none could catch Jin Yongsi’s escape.

“That old dog hurried off without taking that Sacred Artifact,” Ren Hongzhe smiled, seizing a copper mirror and offering it to Nangong Yuqing.

“Say what? Now Luo Tian is our leader; are you mocking me?” Nangong Yuqing’s face darkened, ignoring the mirror and glaring at Ren Hongzhe.

“Leader…” Ren Hongzhe fell silent, staring at Nangong Yuqing.

Lin Yangzhi and Lu Xingzu also fell silent, their reluctance toward Luo Tian evident. To them, Nangong Yuqing’s strength matched Luo Tian’s; their sect’s might rivaled Tianyuan Sect, even surpassing it.

“Smack!” Nangong Yuqing struck Ren Hongzhe’s face before he could speak, coldly demanding: “You don’t listen to me?”

“Listen!” Seeing Nangong Yuqing’s fury, Lin Yangzhi quickly grabbed the mirror and bowed to Luo Tian: “Leader!”

Luo Tian smiled, understanding Nangong Yuqing’s intent. He shook his head: “Nangong Brother, I said we’re allies—true allies. This debt is owed to your sect. From now on, Tianyuan Sect’s disciples will answer your call without hesitation.” He handed the mirror to Nangong Yuqing.

“I’ve obtained the Ten Directions Xuanyu Drum; this Brahman Realm must be of great use to you,” Luo Tian said solemnly, knowing Nangong Yuqing’s long stay in the Brahman Mirror had its purpose.

“Good, I’ll take it,” Nangong Yuqing accepted without hesitation, the Brahman Mirror indeed useful. He nodded and stored it away.

“Remember my words,” Nangong Yuqing glanced at Lin Yangzhi and others before sitting in the void to recover.

The onlookers envied them, though they didn’t know the Mirror’s rank. Yet they recognized its power—enough to harm a Nine Sources.

Yet none dared seize it; though Luo Tian and Nangong Yuqing seemed wounded, the earlier spectacle was too overwhelming. Plus, Lin Yangzhi and Jiang Sixi guarded them.

“You handle it,” Luo Tian sighed, watching the battlefield nearing its end.

Jiang Sixi nodded, her eyes filled with concern. She felt how weak Luo Tian was.

She turned, gazing at the battlefield’s end, her face reflecting awe.

This battle was the fiercest in decades of the Four Sacred Starfields, destined to be etched into history.

Shouts of battle continued but lacked their former grandeur. After the combined forces of Tiger Fortress and Star River Four Thieves crushed Baihu and Zhuque Sects, only a million remained to fight desperately.

Jiang Sixi rubbed her temples, exhaustion in her eyes as she stared at the blood-soaked scene. Her chest tightened; her stomach churned, but she endured—she was the Sect Leader.

“Mercy!” Jiang Sixi spoke softly, halting the battlefield. Tiger Fortress and Star River Four Thieves roared, returning to their lines, eyes burning with bloodlust toward Baihu and Zhuque Sect disciples.

“Kill…” The disciples of Baihu and Zhuque surged forward, eyes blood-red. Their losses included parents, relatives, friends—enemies beyond reconciliation.

Jiang Sixi had hoped to test the waters, but the casualties were too great. Tianyuan Sect itself suffered heavily.

“Kill them,” she waved, and the forces roared again, charging at the remaining million.

Time passed. In the face of overwhelming might, a million fell within an hour, marking the end of the Sect War and the complete annihilation of Zhuque and Baihu Sects. A new powerhouse rose, stepping over millions of corpses to claim dominance.

Tianyuan Sect’s name echoed across the Four Sacred Starfields, everyone discussing Luo Tian and Nangong Yuqing—two young warriors who had felled a Nine Sources and withstood Sacred Artifacts.

After an hour’s recovery, Luo Tian’s cracks faded; he opened his eyes with a smile: “Has the Divine Realm reopened?”

Chapter 835: Re-entering the Divine Realm

The Sect War ended, but its ripples lingered. Tianyuan Sect’s name spread like a storm across the Four Sacred Starfields, becoming known to all. The era of four major sects ended; now only three remained.

Zhuque and Baihu Sects were eradicated, their disciples dead. Zhuque’s leader Ke Zhen Tian fell; Jin Yongsi, drained of essence, fled after activating the Sacred Artifact. Even if he recovered, he dared not reappear openly—Tianyuan Sect’s rise made him a lone wolf.

More shocking was Tianyuan Sect’s might, defeating two sects alone. Even the First Sect, Qinglong Sect, could not match it. Unspokenly, Tianyuan Sect threatened to replace Qinglong as the top force in the Four Sacred Starfields.

Luo Tian and Nangong Yuqing’s names spread, their fame growing. Luo Tian’s legend drew curiosity about his origins. A name—Tianyuan Continent—emerged, stirring whispers.

Meanwhile, tales of Tianyuan Continent surfaced: its past resistance against the Underworld, revealed to shock all. The Four Sacred Starfields condemned the four sects’ treachery and abandonment, with even Xuanwu Sect implicated.

Luo Tian stood in the courtyard, listening to a disciple’s report, smiling faintly. The truth had been spread by Tianyuan Sect—Luo Tian’s order. He refused to let Tianyuan Continent’s ancestors die in obscurity, wanting the world to remember their sacrifice.

“Regardless of reason, Tianyuan Continent has been exonerated. Next step: ascend to Transcendence and revive it in the Four Sacred Starfields,” Luo Tian murmured.

Jiang Sixi supported her slightly swollen belly, pride in her eyes, a maternal glow radiating.

“Three days have passed; I’ve recovered enough. It’s time to enter the Divine Realm. If Sha Cangmang gets there first, it’ll be不利,” Luo Tian gently combed Jiang Sixi’s hair.

“Should I bring more people?” Jiang Sixi worried, leaning on his chest. His wounds were fresh; she hesitated to let him go.

“No, seven-source Supreme-level disciples from the Sect are enough. You stay behind to nurture the child,” Luo Tian held her close, speaking softly.

“Mm.” Jiang Sixi nodded like a dutiful wife, resting on his chest, listening to his heartbeat.

They stood in silence, the scene tenderly heartwarming. Yet a discordant voice broke their moment: “Master, Nangong Yuqing and the others have waited at the gate for half an hour. Are you…?”

Jiang Yimeng hesitated, standing nearby with a troubled look. She didn’t wish to interrupt Luo Tian and Jiang Sixi but feared delaying his mission.

“Alright, I’ll go. Take care of the Sect Leader; if anything happens, I won’t forgive you,” Luo Tian smiled, vanishing.

Jiang Yimeng also stood behind Jiang Sixi, sticking out her tongue.

“Sigh…” Jiang Sixi sighed deeply, a strange unease stirring in her heart.

…

At Tianyuan Sect’s grand gates, Nangong Yuqing and four others stood calmly.

Tianyuan Sect’s side had Tu Hongfei and Ma Yingming, waiting for Luo Tian.

After the Sect War, they were familiar, trained by Nangong Yuqing. Their personalities aligned, so they quickly bonded.

“Leader, Luo Tian said he’d take us to boost our strength. Where are we going? What level will it be? I’m seven-source; without a breakthrough, I can’t ascend for years,” Ren Hongzhe grinned, asking Nangong Yuqing.

“Don’t know,” Nangong Yuqing wiped his bloodstained sword, also eager. He was nine-source; another step would make him Transcendent.

Hearing Nangong Yuqing’s uncertainty, they felt disappointment but waited patiently.

“Sorry for the wait!” Luo Tian appeared, his aura radiating.

“Time is tight; Qinglong Sect’s forces are likely here. We must hurry! Details will be shared on the way,” Luo Tian spoke without delay, vanishing into a streak of light toward Eastping Continent.

They had planned to inquire further but, upon hearing his words, their faces tensed. They leapt after him, leaving Eastping Continent.

Eastping Continent was Qinglong Sect’s domain, close to the Divine Realm. At their speed, they reached it within a day.

With Zhuque and Baihu Sects’ disciples wiped out, only Qinglong and Xuanwu Sects guarded the Divine Realm.

A six-source Supreme sensed the disturbance, shouting: “Stop!” as several streaks of light converged.

“Move aside!” Luo Tian’s cold gaze met the six-source, his nine-source aura overwhelming.

“Nine… Nine Sources…” The six-source trembled, recognizing Luo Tian.

After the Sect War, they’d killed countless, their bloodlust terrifying Qinglong Sect’s disciples. Especially Nangong Yuqing’s aura, like a sea of blood.

“Correct. I’m Luo Tian. Tell me where the Divine Realm’s entrance is,” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed, staring at the sealed realm.

“Don’t know,” the six-source stammered, bowing respectfully.

Luo Tian’s name was legendary—slayer of Ke Zhen Tian. They were insignificant to him, so they obeyed.

Luo Tian doubted their honesty but saw their fear. “Don’t resist; I’ll read your mind.”

He grabbed the six-source, pressing his palm to its head. The six-source trembled, too scared to resist.

Moments later, Luo Tian smiled: “Good, you didn’t lie.”

He tossed the six-source aside, murmuring: “Cunning as Sha Cangmang. He anticipated my arrival.”

“But it’s useless!” Luo Tian’s hands moved, summoning runes into his eyes. His eyes turned purple—Zi Ji Mo Tong (Purple Extreme Demon Eyes), a technique he’d used before. Though minor, it had great potential.

The purple eyes scanned the barrier, then he said: “Let’s go.”

He dashed toward the massive barrier, ignoring its might. Nangong Yuqing followed, unbothered by the barrier. They vanished from Qinglong Sect’s sight.

“Terrifying,” the six-source sweat, grateful he hadn’t become a fool.

Qinglong Sect’s disciples also trembled, cursing their misfortune for angering such foes.

Chapter 836: The Divine Race Appears

In the Divine Realm, Luo Tian and Nangong Yuqing stood, recalling its eerie familiarity. The countless residual souls’ whispers felt like home.

“This is the Divine Realm! So many residual souls—traversing it will be hard,” Ren Hongzhe sighed, his face grim. Nangong Yuqing’s brow furrowed, wary of the souls’ power.

Nangong Yuqing was nine-source but struggled against them. They sensed powerful auras deep within, heart-stirring.

“Follow me,” Luo Tian’s eyes glowed purple, confidence radiating. In the Divine Realm, he was invincible; even a true Transcendent would face him.

He led them to the path of the Transcendent Altar, leaping toward the Supreme Bridge.

Nangong Yuqing and others marveled at his boldness but trusted him.

“Let’s go,” Nangong Yuqing ordered, following Luo Tian.

The journey stunned them; they reached the Supreme Bridge’s entrance, amazed again.

Luo Tian guided them across, but no demons appeared. Yet he felt the ominous presence of the Underworld’s beasts.

“Recovered?” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the flowing river.

The Underworld beasts slept lazily, absorbing gray mist. When Luo Tian looked, the beasts’ eight heads shivered, eyes opening in confusion.

“Strange… why do I feel unease?” The beasts wondered, gazing at the Supreme Bridge but seeing no one.

“Maybe a residual soul ascended to Transcendence? Ascending won’t help!” The beasts scoffed, confident in their dominance over residual souls.

Luo Tian and others reached the other side of the Supreme Bridge, navigating the fierce residual souls toward the golden altar.

The Transcendent Altar had returned to its original state, with thirty-plus figures seated in meditation.

Though the residual souls were terrifying, Luo Tian’s protection shield let them reach the altar’s edge.

“Indeed, Sha Cangmang arrived first,” Luo Tian noted, eyes narrowing at the thirty figures.

But when he saw ten golden-clad youths seated, his brow furrowed.

“Divine Race!” Nangong Yuqing’s eyes flashed cold, gazing at the youths’ lofty aura.

“Xuanwu Elder also arrived,” Luo Tian noticed the transformed Xuanwu old tortoise and Chen Xuanning.

“Swish…” Bloodstained sword emerged in Nangong Yuqing’s hand; his aura surged, ready to storm the altar.

“Wait!” Luo Tian pulled him back, whispering: “The priority is Transcendence. Once we ascend, none of these Divine Race will escape!”

Nangong Yuqing hesitated but nodded. He knew what was crucial.

The seated figures opened their eyes, sensing Luo Tian’s arrival. Sha Cangmang paused, then closed his eyes as if expected.

“You’re Luo Tian? I’ll kill you after ascending,” a nine-source Divine Youth sneered, golden eyes scanning them.

Luo Tian and Nangong Yuqing remained calm, but Ren Hongzhe and Tu Hongfei were stunned. The youth’s gaze felt like a blade slicing through them.

The ten Divine Youth glared with intent, then closed their eyes again.

“Hmph. Who will kill whom?” Luo Tian smirked, stepping onto the Transcendent Altar.

They sat on the altar, closing their eyes.

Luo Tian’s face shifted as he opened his eyes, exchanging glances with Nangong Yuqing. He understood why no one had interfered.

The altar below held three forces of refinement, clashing and restraining each other. One golden force seemed to dominate the others.

“Refinement competition?” Luo Tian and Nangong Yuqing nodded, summoning their refinement forces into the clash.

“Luo Tian, unite with us to expel these Divine Youth! The Four Sacred Starfields’ fortune mustn’t be stolen,” Xuanwu Old Tortoise’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind.

“Good.” Luo Tian responded, knowing the Divine Race’s refinement force was challenging. With Nangong Yuqing and others’ forces, they joined Sha Cangmang and Xuanwu Old Tortoise’s.

“Rippling…!” The altar roared, two massive refinement forces colliding.

“You dare oppose the Divine Race? You’ll die!” The Divine Youth’s voice echoed, filled with malice.

“Leave!” Luo Tian, Xuanwu Old Tortoise, and Sha Cangmang roared.

“Boom…” The three forces collided, submerging the Divine Youth’s refinement force.

“Plop… plop…” The ten Divine Youth vanished from the altar, falling outside.

“Damn you!” The youth’s face twisted with hatred, gazing at Luo Tian and Sha Cangmang.

Transcendence was the goal of all nine-source disciples. Once ascended, they transcended humanity—nine-source disciples were mere mortals. This youth’s expulsion meant he’d lost his chance, enough to drive him mad.

“Hmph. My fortune is mine. Even if you took it, I’ll reclaim it. The Four Sacred Starfields lack even a Transcendent—dare to oppose the Divine Race? You’ll die. Wait for my uncle; you’re but dirt before him,” the youth, Sun Xinghuo, sneered.

Luo Tian and others ignored him, continuing their meditation.

Transcendence was no lure for Tu Hongfei and others. Only Luo Tian, Nangong Yuqing, Xuanwu Old Tortoise, and Sha Cangmang competed. Others withdrew to absorb the altar’s essence.

“Luo Tian, let’s combine forces to expel those old men!” Nangong Yuqing whispered, excitement in his voice.

They were the Four Sacred Starfields’ strongest. Luo Tian and Nangong Yuqing’s power was unmatched, even Sha Cangmang couldn’t match them. They had the advantage.

“Luo Tian, sorry—I’m nearing my end. I must ascend; otherwise, I’ll die. This fortune is mine,” Xuanwu Old Tortoise’s voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, joining Sha Cangmang to expel Luo Tian.

Luo Tian opened his eyes, nodding. For a nine-source nearing death, Transcendence was irresistible. He wouldn’t blame Xuanwu Old Tortoise for his debt to the Sect.

But Luo Tian had reasons to ascend, so he wouldn’t yield.

“Return!” He ignored the forces being consumed and opened his eyes, dropping a drop of blood onto the golden altar.

“This fortune isn’t yours—it’s mine, Luo Tian! None shall take it!” He declared, his voice resolute. His hands formed seals, striking the altar with a mighty force.

Chapter 837: Nine Sources Converge

As Luo Tian’s blood fell and his hands struck, the altar roared. The runes glowed rapidly, flowing toward him, wrapping his body.

“Does that kid not want to compete?” The Divine Youth outside marveled, watching Luo Tian rise.

Yet the altar’s Nangong Yuqing and Sha Cangmang felt their refinement forces repelled, as if the altar itself rejected them.

“Transcendence! I’ll transcend!” Sha Cangmang raged, his white hair flying. His nine essences poured into the altar, striving for one last push.

“Huff…” Nangong Yuqing withdrew his forces, knowing Luo Tian had a way to claim the altar. He focused on Sun Xinghuo below.

Xuanwu Old Tortoise sighed, understanding that if the altar rejected him, even his essence would fail—accelerating death.

With Nangong Yuqing and Xuanwu Old Tortoise’s withdrawal, only Sha Cangmang’s force remained.

In an instant, his force expelled Luo Tian’s lingering energy from the altar, filling it.

Sha Cangmang grinned wildly, his body trembling with thunderous roars. He felt his nine essences converging in his dantian, moving with a rhythm.

“Half-Transcendent!” He realized in moments, his voice echoing.

“One step more, and I’ll be a Transcendent!” Sha Cangmang roared, forgetting the altar’s growing rejection.
