This mountain was the Holy Mountain of the Snake Clan. Since the time the Snake Clan first appeared in the Immortal Mountain, they had revered this mountain and continued to do so until now. No one knew how long it had stood. The Queen of the Snake Clan had been in a deep slumber within this Holy Mountain since time immemorial. The Snake Clan's legend held that the Queen had led her people to the Immortal Mountain, claiming this region as their own with supreme power, allowing the Snake Clan to flourish until now.

Time had passed beyond reckoning, and though the Snake Clan had grown strong, their Queen remained in slumber, like a guardian deity protecting them. In the depths of the Immortal Mountain, terrible upheavals had once occurred, and the Queen had awoken to quell all threats, safeguarding her people. Now, however, the Snake Clan faced another crisis. A hundred years ago, a clan had emerged from the depths of the Immortal Mountain and established itself just beyond the Snake Clan's borders.

The Sky Eagle Clan. The serpents and eagles had always been sworn enemies, and the eagle clan held a natural dominance over the snake clan. Thus, the two clans had engaged in fierce bloodshed upon discovering each other's presence.

Both the Snake Clan and Sky Eagle Clan possessed late-stage Immortal King-level warriors, but these two had fought to mutual injury and required extensive time for recovery. The Sky Eagle Clan's warrior sought to subdue the Snake Clan, launching small-scale skirmishes frequently. The Sky Eagle Clan had gained the upper hand.

Recently, a message had returned to the Snake Clan: the Sky Eagle Clan's late-stage Immortal King warrior had recovered their strength and was preparing to eradicate the Snake Clan before their ancestral sage had regained his power.

"O Queen, awaken and protect your people!" A multitude of serpents encircled the Holy Mountain. Many had transformed into human forms, their eyes filled with devotion as they prayed to the mountain. Yet after days of fervent prayers, there had been no response. Thus, the Snake Clan was in a state of extreme anxiety; their elders had ventured out to seek solutions.

On this day, as the Snake Clan prayed, a streak of light shot from afar. A colossal figure, towering at a thousand zhang in height, strode forward with great strides and rushed into the Valley of Ten Thousand Serpents.

"Make way!" A voice, filled with urgency, echoed through the heavens before the figure had even arrived.

"Who is this?" The Snake Clan's people were stunned, instantly scattering. Their fear stemmed from the overwhelming power and fierce aura of this figure.

With a thunderous roar, the figure's speed was astonishing. It reached the mountain's exterior in an instant, lifting a vast expanse of ground into the air. Under the Snake Clan's horrified gazes, this massive form collided with the Holy Mountain.

Rumbling... Dust filled the air as the mighty mountain trembled violently. The Valley of Ten Thousand Serpents fell into silence, its people speechless.

"Who dares attack our Snake Clan's Holy Mountain!"

"Is the heavens against us? Even the Holy Mountain has been struck!" The Snake Clan's people cried out, one long serpent rising into the air toward the mountain.

"Painful... I'm still dazed," Luo Tian mumbled as he stood up, his gaze bewildered. Though the mountain had not collapsed under Luo Tian's collision, it had shed a cascade of debris across the ground.

"I still need to adjust to these wings of mist!" Luo Tian muttered, then felt a chill as countless sinister gazes fell upon him.

"Who are you?" An elderly man, his face pale, stepped forward. Behind him stood many figures and serpents surrounding Luo Tian.

"Excuse me, I must be going!" Cold sweat immediately appeared on Luo Tian's face. Not only was the elder's cultivation unknown, but even the two late-stage Immortal King warriors beside him were enough to overwhelm Luo Tian.

"Is there such a terrifying force within the Immortal Mountain!" Luo Tian's heart trembled. Such an immense power was comparable to the Nine Great Mountains.

As he spoke, Luo Tian realized it was too late to flee. Countless serpents had surrounded him, and the Immortal King warriors watched with predatory eyes, sealing off space to leave no escape.

"Kill him! He disturbed the Queen's rest!"

"Let us use human blood to sacrifice the Queen. Perhaps it will awaken her!" A chorus of furious voices echoed.

In the chaos, a late-stage Immortal King and an early-stage Immortal King warrior had already attacked. Their martial techniques surged toward Luo Tian.

"Don't force me! Your Snake Clan is so unreasonable!" Luo Tian's eyes turned icy. He formed a hand seal, and the Punishment Hell Demon Claws erupted forth. A monstrous beast roared, embodying Luo Tian's fury as it clashed with the two martial techniques.

Boom... Boom...

Two resounding explosions shattered both techniques, and a violent gust of wind swept over Luo Tian's massive form, pushing him back. He collided once more with the Holy Mountain.

"Stop!" The elder's eyes twitched as he saw the mountain struck. He quickly shouted, commanding them to cease.

Hearing the elder's command, the Snake Clan dared not attack further but still stared at Luo Tian with a hunger to devour him.

"they care deeply about this mountain!" Luo Tian realized the Snake Clan's weakness. He drew out his Dragon Abyss Sword, gazing at the elder.

"If you attack me again, I'll shatter this mountain!" Luo Tian shouted, his voice laced with threat. The Dragon Abyss Sword radiated a dark glow.

Luo Tian's words had barely finished when several figures shot through the air. They were Huang Qun and the Snake Clan warriors who had previously fought Luo Tian.

"Clan Leader, he killed Xuan She!" The late-stage Immortal King warrior shouted, his eyes filled with anger.

"Rubbish! I didn't do anything. You wanted to kill me for sacrifice, so why shouldn't I fight back? And I didn't intentionally kill him!" Luo Tian cursed, glaring at the surrounding Snake Clan warriors, his mind seething.

"Master, I've come to save you!" As Luo Tian's words finished, two streaks of light arrived instantly. It was Tang Xinghuo and Yin Yitian. The one who spoke was Tang Xinghuo, his voice filled with resolve.

Tang Xinghuo and Yin Yitian saw the overwhelming number of Snake Clan warriors, their hearts sinking. Still, they pressed forward into Luo Tian's defense.

"Boom..." They had overstepped their bounds. Tang Xinghuo's body collided with the Holy Mountain again, sending more debris flying.

"You..." The elder's lips twitched as he watched Luo Tian and his companions. His gaze fell on Luo Tian, and upon seeing the pair of black-and-white wings behind him, his eyes narrowed slightly.

"Who are you to that powerful figure within the Immortal Mountain?" The elder asked, his voice heavy with concern.

"Disciple!" Luo Tian answered boldly. He knew it was likely the Snake Clan had seen the Fallen Heaven Immortal King, and he himself was from the Heavenly Dao Mountain.

"Boom..." As they spoke, the Holy Mountain behind Luo Tian and his companions began to rumble. It could no longer withstand the pressure, starting to collapse.

"The Holy Mountain is collapsing!" The Snake Clan's people cried out as the mountain crumbled. It was their faith, a belief they had held for countless years. Their Holy Mountain collapsing caused many to weep, even the elder's face turned sorrowful and red-eyed.

"Kill them!" The elder commanded coldly, his eyes filled with icy determination without hesitation.

"You did this!" Luo Tian glared at Tang Xinghuo, but it was too late to say anything. The Dragon Abyss Sword expanded in power, radiating an overwhelming aura.

A torrent of divine laws flowed through the Snake Clan warriors' hands. Each carried a destructive force, and countless serpents hissed.

"Buzz..." Just as the terrifying martial techniques凝聚ed, a wave of energy rose from the debris behind Luo Tian and his companions.

A surge of divine light filled the sky, a green serpent-shaped phantom rising suddenly. At the same time, a green light flew from outside the crowd, a small green serpent moving at lightning speed. Even Luo Tian and his companions couldn't react in time.

Crash... Crashes echoed as pieces of debris slowly coalesced into a figure, appearing before the people's eyes.

"Stop!" The elder quickly shouted, his gaze falling on the figure behind Luo Tian and his companions.

Its long body was human-like in form, with a human upper half and serpentine lower half. Though it was a stone statue, if one only saw the upper body, it would be an alluring beauty. Yet it possessed a cold aura and a beautiful yet seductive face.

"O Queen!" Many of the Snake Clan's people immediately knelt, their eyes filled with fervor as they gazed at the statue behind Luo Tian and his companions.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian and his companions were stunned, turning to face the statue. Upon seeing it, their bodies halted abruptly, a pressure emanating from the stone figure. Even as Immortal Kings, they felt the overwhelming strength of its aura.

"A great power! Definitely a great power!" Luo Tian's heart cried out. He gazed at the lifelike statue, especially its eyes, which gave a sense of depth that one could easily become lost in.

"I need your help..." A weak voice echoed from within the statue, causing everyone to tremble. A green light descended upon Luo Tian.

"Master, you're green..."

"You're looking for help!" Tang Xinghuo's face lit up with joy, addressing Luo Tian. He knew they had salvation now.

"You're the one who's green! Your whole family is!" Luo Tian cursed, slapping Tang Xinghuo on the head.

"Dear human friend, please help our Queen awaken. We will surely offer great rewards!" The elder's face was filled with excitement as he addressed Luo Tian.

Luo Tian was speechless, watching the Snake Clan people. Just now they had wanted to kill him, but now their faces had changed so quickly—too fast for a book's page turn.

Chapter 2444: Petrification()

"Please save our Snake Clan Queen!" Many of the Snake Clan people, their faces filled with entreaty, addressed Luo Tian.

"I could say no...," Luo Tian muttered internally. Yet his face wore a smile: "Previously, it was all a misunderstanding. I am willing to befriend the Snake Clan. But how do I save her?"

"If I don't save, you'll still kill us!" Luo Tian muttered internally, gazing at the Snake Clan people.

Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo took a long breath, relieved that they had escaped. If those people had truly attacked them together, the three of them would have been in grave danger.

"Place your hand on my body!" A weak voice echoed, causing everyone's heart to tremble.

Under the Snake Clan people's expectant gazes, Luo Tian smiled awkwardly while remaining vigilant. He placed his hand on the statue.

"Where are you putting it!" Huang Qun's voice suddenly shouted, and a wave of anger emanated from the statue. Luo Tian frowned slightly, turning to look at where his hand was placed, as if electrocuted, and withdrew it.

"Even turned to stone, it still has feelings!" Luo Tian muttered internally. He now realized this statue was the Queen of the Snake Clan. His placement had indeed been awkward, but he had simply placed it there casually. He hadn't expected to hit a sensitive spot.

The Snake Clan people's gazes turned fierce again toward Luo Tian. He was insulting their faith; if it weren't for his ability to heal the Queen, they would have attacked him again.

Luo Tian wore a forced smile. He dared not be too bold, knowing his life was tied to the Queen's.

Luo Tian waved his hand again. This time, he placed it on the statue's tail. A wave of energy affected his soul. At the same time, a vague figure appeared in Luo Tian's mind, identical to the statue but more captivating.

Yet this woman's eyes were closed, her upper body clad in a green robe, but her figure was undeniably alluring. Her lower tail swayed continuously.

Luo Tian knew without a doubt that this was the Queen of the Snake Clan. He understood she appeared delicate but her power was definitely terrifying.

"I need the eyes of the Wind-Whispering Beast and the immortal herb you carry!" A cold voice echoed in Luo Tian's mind, causing his body to tremble.

The Wind-Whispering Beast's eyes were something Luo Tian could part with, but the immortal herb was something he hesitated to give.

"Due to my cultivation method, I must be petrified nine times, each lasting ten thousand years. The last time the Snake Clan was in turmoil, I forced my way out of petrification. Therefore, this time I cannot recover. If I don't recover, I will be trapped in this stone body!"

"I saw that small green serpent earlier. It was a fragment of my soul, manifested to find some way for me to recover!"

"I didn't expect to meet you. I felt the aura of the Wind-Whispering Beast and the immortal herb on you. These two things are very useful to me!" The beautiful, ethereal woman spoke, making Luo Tian understand.

"I won't take your things for nothing. If I recover, I can help you twice!" The cold voice echoed.

"What level are you?" Luo Tian asked, his heart excited. This Queen was definitely no pushover. He felt her power was surely at the peak of Immortal King.

"This is my last time breaking out of petrification. If I succeed, I should reach the threshold of Emperor level!" The woman spoke, causing Luo Tian's brows to furrow slightly.

"Emperor level? What is that?"

"This is the peak of Immortal King!" Luo Tian's heart surged with waves. In his understanding, the peak of Immortal King was the top of the world.

"Emperor level is above Immortal King!" Luo Tian quickly defined it, his heart shocked.

"But nothing is absolute. Perhaps there are still Emperor-level masters in the world. In ancient times, those great powers were all Emperor-level masters. However, for unknown reasons, they all mysteriously perished!"

"According to my inherited memories, human clan, beast clan, demon clan, and ghost clan all had Emperor-level masters!" The ethereal woman spoke again.

"An ancient era, what a glorious time!" Luo Tian's heart was shocked. His mind conjured an image of emperors vying for dominance, where Immortal Kings had to submit.

"Times have changed. Now the peak is Immortal King. My ancestors were Emperor-level masters, but even with inherited memories, that memory was erased. We don't know what terrible event happened in the ancient times!" The ethereal woman spoke with a sigh.

"Enough talk. Do you give it or not?" The ethereal woman spoke, her eyes still closed, voice commanding.

"Give!" Luo Tian didn't hesitate. A half-step Emperor-level favor was something he couldn't miss. If she truly spoke the truth, even destroying the Nine Great Mountains would be no problem for her.

"When will you break free?" Luo Tian asked again, thinking it best to wait until he went to the Eternal Mountain and brought this living ancestor with him to destroy the Eternal Mountain.

"Decades!" However, the ethereal woman's answer caused Luo Tian's heart to sink.

Luo Tian said nothing, and the weak figure imprinted the method of saving her on Luo Tian's mind.

Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes, seeing the many Snake Clan people filled with expectation.

"It's simple!" Luo Tian smiled lightly and waved his hand, taking out the immortal herb he had cultivated.

"Buzz..." Vitality descended. The immortal herb appeared with a large piece of rock before the Snake Clan's eyes.

Luo Tian was reluctant to place it on the ground, but he did so. He also picked up the statue of the Queen and carried it, causing the Snake Clan people to gasp.

"Boom..." The statue fell onto the rock and stood there. At the same time, Luo Tian took out the two Wind-Whispering Beast eyes and placed them in the statue's eye sockets.

A wave of energy spread from the statue, and the two Wind-Whispering Beast eyes slowly sank into the statue. The stone skin began to descend, covering the woman's eyes as if she were closing them. At the same time, green light began to radiate outward, falling upon the immortal herb Luo Tian had cultivated. It resonated with the statue, forming a cycle of mutual exchange and transformation.

"Awakening!" The Snake Clan people fell to their knees in droves, eyes filled with excitement as they gazed at the statue radiating vitality.

"Thank you for your help, dear friend. Has the Queen said how long she needs to awaken?" The elder's face was filled with gratitude, gazing at Luo Tian.

"She said decades!" Luo Tian replied without hesitation. His words caused the Snake Clan people to fall silent.

"The Sky Eagle Clan will soon attack. What can we use to resist?" A chorus of lamentations arose.

"Once this elder recovers his strength, he should be able to resist a little!" Luo Tian looked at the pale-faced elder and smiled slightly.

"Yes, he should be able to resist a little. Unfortunately, I am... Ah..." The elder sighed longingly. He knew his current state.

"If I'm not mistaken, this elder's meridians are completely disordered. Many of his meridians have been shattered, and he's only maintaining basic functions with his cultivation. With this elder's strength, it would take decades to recover!" Luo Tian spoke softly, causing the elder's gaze to fall on him.

Although Immortal Kings could use the power of heaven and earth to help others recover, they themselves couldn't. Once one reached Immortal King level, even if their body was shattered, other Immortal Kings would find it very difficult to help them restore their bodies.

"Do you have a way?" The elder gazed at Luo Tian. He had lived long enough to understand the meaning of Luo Tian's words.

"Eighty percent!" Luo Tian spoke softly. He was a cultivator and had learned some medical arts from Run Hongyu, though he hadn't mastered them well. Still, he had some confidence.

"Little friend, what conditions do you have? Please state them!" The elder spoke, his eyes filled with excitement as he gazed at Luo Tian.

"I need herbs, a lot of herbs. I need to refine elixirs. As for what kind of elixir, I still need to think about it!" Luo Tian replied. His mind knew he might be getting rich again.

The old mountain rarely had people enter, so the herbs within the Immortal Mountain were definitely numerous. The Snake Clan had lived there for generations, so they must have accumulated many.

"Herbs? We do have some. Little friend, follow me. Let the two friends here arrange first, and I'll take you to see if there's anything you need!" The elder smiled as if forgetting the previous unpleasantness, leading Luo Tian into the depths of the Valley of Ten Thousand Serpents.

However, two late-stage Immortal King warriors followed Luo Tian and the elder. The elder's current state was weak, so they were still concerned about him. They didn't let the elder be alone with Luo Tian.

Four people quickly arrived at a cave. The cave was dry and had glowing light around it.

After walking for an hour, Luo Tian was stunned. A vast array of weapons lay scattered there, radiating ancient and powerful auras—clearly not ordinary items.

"These are all things we've collected. Little friend, if you like, feel free to pick a few!" The elder smiled and continued leading Luo Tian deeper.

After another hour, waves of vitality rushed toward him. Looking ahead, he saw a row of herbs appearing before his eyes.

Chapter 2445: You Killed Him()

In the cave, a vast expanse of green appeared before Luo Tian's eyes. The vitality was rich and made his eyes bright. He gazed at each herb.

"Let me introduce myself, I am Fu Hong, a King Serpent. Call me Elder Fu!" The elder spoke, smiling at Luo Tian.

"These are our herbs. Feel free to pick any you like! We Snake Clan people don't understand, we only know how to eat them raw. Do you need any?" Fu Hong became anxious again, as it concerned when he would recover.

"Enough should be there. I still need to choose!" Luo Tian's mouth almost drooled as he replied to Fu Hong.

"Then feel free to choose, we'll go out first!" Fu Hong spoke without hesitation. In his mind, no herbs were more important than his recovery, even if Luo Tian took all the herbs.

Luo Tian watched Fu Hong and the two late-stage Immortal King warriors leave. He turned around, gazing at each herb with deep breaths and a dazed expression. A cultivator's favorite thing was herbs, and Luo Tian was no exception.

"Purification Elixir, a seven-star elixir!" The idea of a formula immediately appeared in Luo Tian's mind to treat Fu Hong. However, a seven-star elixir could only speed up Fu Hong's recovery. He would also need to use acupuncture with golden needles to enhance Fu Hong's recovery and help him recover quickly.

"All mine!" Luo Tian laughed loudly, rushing into the herbs as if facing a beautiful woman.

...

After half a day, Luo Tian finally emerged from the cave with a flushed face.

"The Snake Clan's herbs are truly rich. Elder, wait for me half a day; I'll treat you after that!" Luo Tian spoke softly, gazing at Fu Hong waiting outside the cave.

"Then I'll trouble you!" Fu Hong bowed to Luo Tian, personally leading him and guiding him toward the Snake Clan's territory.

Under countless Snake Clan people's respectful gazes, Fu Hong led Luo Tian to a courtyard. Two figures sat there.

They were Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo. They were quite comfortable, with two water-scaled women sitting in front of them.

"I told you I wasn't like this before. It was only after entering a forbidden area that I became like this. If I recover, I'll be as charming again!" Tang Xinghuo spoke to the two women, his hands wandering.

"You two are really at ease!" Luo Tian smiled as he entered. Tang Xinghuo was fine, but Luo Tian hadn't expected Yin Yitian to be like this either.

"Men aren't all good!" However, Luo Tian was relieved. He stepped into the courtyard.

"If you like, I can also arrange for you!" Fu Hong smiled and spoke to Luo Tian. Serpents were naturally lustful, so the Snake Clan was quite open about such matters.

"Continue with your business. I'll adjust my state!" Luo Tian spoke to the two who were about to stand up, stepping into the room.

Time flowed slowly. Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo remained in the courtyard waiting, and after an hour, Luo Tian walked out with a smile.

"Boom..." A large cauldron fell to the ground. Nine coiled dragons were vividly carved, and Luo Tian began refining elixirs.

"Master, are you going to refine elixirs?" Tang Xinghuo's eyes showed surprise. He hadn't expected Luo Tian to have this talent.

"Buzz..." As Tang Xinghuo's words finished, Luo Tian had already started refining. A series of hand movements appeared around the Nine Dragon Fire Cauldron, and a rich vitality began to radiate.

"Your technique is very skilled. It's better than any alchemist I've seen!" Yin Yitian's eyes shone with admiration. He and Tang Xinghuo had some fame in the Upper Three Realms, so they had seen alchemists refine elixirs.

"Master is truly a prodigy. Even the geniuses of the Nine Great Mountains are nothing compared to him!" Tang Xinghuo looked at Luo Tian with reverence. The longer he spent with Luo Tian, the more terrifying he found him.

"Boom..." After an hour, the sky darkened. Black thunderclouds roared and descended, terrifying lightning storms continuously swept over. Luo Tian laughed and struck open the lid of the Nine Dragon Fire Cauldron, a golden elixir rising and beginning to fight against the lightning storm.

The thunderous sound continued for an hour. The elixir storm finally faded, and Luo Tian appeared before the golden light, grabbing it in his hand.

"Good luck. The first furnace was successful!" Luo Tian smiled and stored the elixir, placing it before Fu Hong.

"Elder Fu, you can prepare yourself. Next, there may be some pain!" Luo Tian spoke to Fu Hong, his eyes filled with a strange expression.

"Rest assured. I've lived so long; what pain haven't I endured? If it helps me recover, what is pain?" Fu Hong spoke softly, not taking it seriously.

"Then please enter the cauldron!" Luo Tian said. He knew many people underestimated his acupuncture technique.

"Good!" Fu Hong leaped into the Nine Dragon Fire Cauldron. Luo Tian began to continuously throw herbs into it, refining the medicinal liquid.

One herb... ten herbs... quickly, each herb was transformed into a medicinal liquid, filling the entire cauldron. Fu Hong's body quickly submerged to his neck.

Gurgle... The medicinal liquid rose, Fu Hong's old face turned red. He felt his every hair was stretched open. The rich medicinal power continuously poured into Fu Hong's body.

"Ahh..." Fu Hong couldn't help but groan in pleasure. He quickly stifled it, feeling a bit embarrassed.

Luo Tian continued refining, his eyes focused. He kept throwing herbs into the cauldron.

But while Luo Tian was refining the herbs into medicinal liquid, a figure silently arrived at his back.

This person was an adult man, one of the two late-stage Immortal King warriors who had accompanied Fu Hong into the cave where herbs were planted.

The man's eyes flashed with a sinister light, and he struck like lightning. A black hand shot out, striking Luo Tian's back.

Late-stage Immortal King, a full-force strike. An assassination strike. No one expected the man to attack, not even his companion.

"Boom..." The thunderous power of the strike caused Fu Hong to react. However, it was too late. When Fu Hong reacted, the black hand had already struck Luo Tian's back.

Luo Tian hadn't expected the man to attack, so he didn't react. When he realized it, the black hand had already landed on his back.

"Pu..." Luo Tian felt his heart stop. A massive force pushed against his back, and blood gushed from his mouth. His body was violently slammed into the Nine Dragon Fire Cauldron, carrying it forward.

Boom... Boom... Boom...

The thunderous sound spread. Each courtyard was shattered. Luo Tian's pale face clung to the Nine Dragon Fire Cauldron, his back indented.

"Chen Zhong!" The other late-stage Immortal King warrior shouted, his eyes filled with disbelief.

"Boom..." A solid strike landed on Luo Tian's back.

"Pu..." Blood gushed from Luo Tian's mouth. His face was as pale as a sheet of paper.

"Master, you can't die!" Tang Xinghuo and Yin Yitian were both panicked. Luo Tian had placed a restriction on their bodies.

"I... I'm not dead yet!" Luo Tian's weak voice echoed. His heart was bitter.

A late-stage Immortal King's assassination strike wasn't easy to withstand. When the man's hand touched Luo Tian's back, his Demon Cloud Wings automatically spread out to block part of the power. Additionally, Luo Tian's heart was transformed from the World Heart, which could withstand a lot of attacks. Both were essential; without one, Luo Tian would have already been dead. Even so, he was severely injured and in a poor state.

"Too careless! I never expected someone to betray me!" Luo Tian cursed internally. He hadn't anticipated anyone would attack him.

"Only by killing him can the ancestor not live!"

"I've already defected to the Sky Eagle Clan!" Chen Zhong spoke, gazing at Luo Tian.

"You must have hit your head with a door!" Luo Tian's mouth spat out blood. His eyes gazed at Chen Zhong, breathing heavily from anger.

"You don't want him to live. Kill him!" Luo Tian's heart was filled with frustration. He looked at Chen Zhong, thinking this person's intelligence was a miracle to have reached late-stage Immortal King.

"Kill him for me!" Luo Tian commanded Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo. He felt insulted, having been outwitted by such an intelligent person. The more he thought about it, the more frustrated he became.

"Master you..." Tang Xinghuo and Yin Yitian looked at Luo Tian's lifeless state, unsure of what to do.

"Kill him for me! I'm fine!" Luo Tian saw their hesitation and shouted. If he didn't kill this Chen Zhong, he felt like he would die of frustration.

"Yes..." Hearing Luo Tian's confirmation, Yin Yitian and Tang Xinghuo moved swiftly toward Chen Zhong.

But someone was faster than them. It was the other late-stage Immortal King warrior, his eyes filled with madness. He rushed toward Chen Zhong and struck a punch.

"Why? Why betray the Snake Clan!" The adult man shouted, his voice filled with overwhelming hatred.

Chapter 2446: Sky Eagle Clan

The battle erupted instantly. The Snake Clan's adult man was疯狂, continuously striking with punches.

"Li Cheng, in our years of friendship, let me off once!" Chen Zhong shouted. Li Cheng's attacks were relentless, preventing him from escaping.

"Let your mother!" At this moment, Yin Yitian arrived and cursed. His voice was also angry. He swung his long sword with great anger.

"Have you ever considered the Snake Clan's kindness over these years? Now that the Snake Clan has a chance to survive, it is destroyed by your hands. What face do you have to talk about friendship with me!" Li Cheng shouted, his attacks growing stronger. He even burned his cultivation.

Thousands of punches formed into serpentine heads, striking Chen Zhong. Chen Zhong fought back, but they were evenly matched. However, Yin Yitian's sword strikes brought Chen Zhong great trouble. Each strike added a wound to him.

"Blood Escape!" Chen Zhong couldn't withstand it anymore. He felt the remaining Snake Clan warriors were coming, and if he was surrounded, he would have no chance of survival.

Chen Zhong feared death; otherwise, he wouldn't have defected to the Sky Eagle Clan. This time was also a gamble for him, as he didn't believe in the Snake Clan.

If the Queen revived, they could win. But the Queen needed decades to recover. By then, they would have already been wiped out by the Sky Eagle Clan. As for Fu Hong's recovery, even after he recovered, it would still be suppressed by the Sky Eagle Clan's late-stage Immortal King. It was just a repetition of previous events.

This time, Chen Zhong's attack was to ensure his position in the Sky Eagle Clan. It was also his offering.

Killing Fu Hong, Chen Zhong had some hesitation. Therefore, he chose to kill Luo Tian who could heal Fu Hong.

But Chen Zhong hadn't expected that his near-kill strike had failed to kill Luo Tian.

Blood runes flowed across Chen Zhong's body, and he endured Li Cheng and Yin Yitian's attacks. His body broke through space, forming a streak of blood, rushing toward the Snake Clan's exterior.

"Damn it! He learned a secret technique!" Li Cheng's face was grim. Chen Zhong's sudden burst of speed was too fast, and even with their combined strength, they couldn't stop him.

Luo Tian wasn't surprised. He watched Chen Zhong escape. Unless three late-stage Immortal Kings surrounded him, it was very difficult to kill a late-stage Immortal King at the same level.

"Idiot! Wait, I'll finish you when I recover!" Luo Tian cursed internally. He was quite frustrated. He placed a pill in his mouth.

"Little friend, what should I do?" Fu Hong asked from within the Nine Dragon Fire Cauldron. His face was filled with a smile. Luo Tian's current state meant he couldn't help him.

"Master, take this pill and recover. I'll heal you as soon as I'm ready!" Luo Tian took out the Purification Elixir and handed it to Tang Xinghuo, who fed it to Fu Hong.

At the same time, Luo Tian felt worried. Chen Zhong's escape might have reached the Sky Eagle Clan. Therefore, the Sky Eagle Clan would likely launch an attack soon.

"What's happening?" As they spoke, a large number of Snake Clan people arrived. They looked at the ruined courtyard and Luo Tian's pale face, their hearts sinking.

"Nothing is wrong. Everyone prepare for battle. Our Snake Clan's great disaster should be coming soon!" Fu Hong, his face still red, spoke to the Snake Clan people. Luo Tian could think of it; how could he not?

"Chen Zhong defected, wounded the one who could heal our ancestor, and escaped to join the Sky Eagle Clan."

"..."
