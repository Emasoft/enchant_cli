“Luo Tian!” A cry of alarm rang out as Luo Tian struck, his blood-stained blade slicing through the air like a reaper’s scythe. The crimson aura of his sword exuded an eerie allure, cleaving through the front-line disciples.

Plop plop plop……

Blood erupted as several True Immortal Realm disciples were instantly slain by Luo Tian’s strike. Without hesitation, he surged forward like a tiger into a flock of sheep, plunging into the crowd.

“Luo Tian is here!” As Luo Tian appeared, it was as if he had disturbed a beehive, and cries of alarm echoed through the air.

“He’s a True Immortal—block him!” Many shouted, their hands glowing with divine light as they unleashed martial techniques toward Luo Tian.

Luo Tian gave them no chance to act, his Huangquan Step activating, leaving behind a trail of afterimages that made their attacks miss.

At the same time, Luo Tian’s blood knife slashed repeatedly, each disciple falling beneath his blade.

Behind him, thunderous explosions echoed as the disciples’ martial techniques struck the ground where he had stepped. The speed of their attacks could not match Luo Tian’s flight.

Ten… twenty…

After seven strikes, Luo Tian had slain a vast number of True Immortal Realm disciples, carving a path through the encirclement of Qingshan Sect.

The remaining disciples trembled in fear, stunned by Luo Tian’s ruthless speed.

Luo Tian soared out of the encirclement, flying toward the distance. Yet he knew this was only his first step; the road ahead would be far more arduous.

As soon as he left, countless figures rushed forward, leaping into the air and shouting as they pursued Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s speed was fast, but not uncatchable—half-step Heavenly Kings could match his pace.

Three half-step Heavenly Kings and a dozen True Immortal Peak disciples followed him like shadows.

“Not bad,” Luo Tian consoled himself mentally, but if he faltered or was surrounded, trouble would follow.

“Regain your strength quickly!” Luo Tian’s mind panicked; this drain was slowing his recovery from the weakening phase.

Fortunately, his speed was enough. The sect masters had apparently been frightened by Luo Tian’s earlier display and hadn’t sent Heavenly Kings to pursue him. Instead, they had dispatched half-step Heavenly Kings and True Immortal Peaks to test him before making their move.

“Those bastards!” Luo Tian cursed mentally as he ran, though they hadn’t caught him, they clung to his tail.

“Luo Tian is only at the middle of True Immortal Realm, but we’ve chased him for two hours and he hasn’t fought back. His strength can slay True Immortals,” the half-step Heavenly Kings reported to their sects.

They weren’t fools; the Heavenly King masters hadn’t personally intervened, and these half-step Heavenly Kings knew well that their sect masters had sent them to test Luo Tian. After all, his reputation was too terrifying—should he attack, they would flee immediately.

Time passed; these disciples had chased Luo Tian for an entire day, during which he had slain countless intercepting True Immortals.

Yet when confronted by half-step Heavenly Kings, he had struck and retreated instantly, further confirming that Luo Tian was no match for them.

“Luo Tian, today is your day of death!”

“After observing a day, I can’t wait any longer,” the remaining sect masters finally grew impatient. This was the perfect opportunity to kill Luo Tian—miss this chance, and it would be lost forever.

Numerous powerful auras rushed toward Luo Tian’s path. Heavenly King speed was far faster than his own.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian flew for another half-day, his face darkening as he sensed a Heavenly King aura approaching from behind. It would catch up within half an hour.

“Xu Tian Dao Ren!” Everyone froze upon seeing the appearing Heavenly King.

The man wore a tattered gray robe, his appearance resembling an old beggar—thin and gaunt.

“How is it possible? It was said that Xu Tian Dao Ren lived for tens of thousands of years and has already died!” People gasped, watching the gaunt immortal soar toward them.

Xu Tian Dao Ren was a renowned rogue in the Central Three Heavens, an ancient relic of the Immortal Realm. His strength was at the late Heavenly King stage but he had never ascended to the peak.

Later, he vanished without a trace, and people spread rumors that his time had come, dying in some remote place. None expected this old man to appear at this moment.

“But why is his strength now at the early Heavenly King stage?” People soon marveled, for Xu Tian Dao Ren’s power had dropped significantly from his peak.

Chapter 2586: The Emergence of a Powerhouse

Xu Tian Dao Ren, long believed dead, suddenly appeared—naturally causing shock.

“Why has he dropped to the early Heavenly King stage?” Everyone gazed at the ragged old man, surprised that the first to appear was not the sect masters but this old man.

“He must have done something that caused his strength to plummet; otherwise, he wouldn’t have lived this long. He’s an ancient figure from the era after the great age, a contemporary of the nine heavenly mountains’ peak Heavenly Kings,” people murmured lowly, watching Xu Tian Dao Ren fly past them.

Luo Tian didn’t stop; his speed surged, widening the gap between him and others.

“Little friend, wait a moment—old man has something to discuss with you!” Xu Tian Dao Ren’s aged face bore a smile as he stepped through the void, closing the distance with Luo Tian.

“Discuss your mother!” Luo Tian cursed, knowing this old man had come to trouble him.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian finished cursing, a gray hand shot from the void and struck Luo Tian’s back.

“Boom…” The gray hand slammed onto Luo Tian’s back, causing him to spit blood and accelerate.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian spat blood, but one strike had boosted his speed significantly—yet the cost was immense. He felt his internal organs shift position.

“Old man, what do you want? Speak!” Luo Tian shouted; his priority was survival, even if it meant paying a heavy price. He would reclaim it once he recovered his strength.

“I originally wanted your world treasure, but now I want your body—such a strong physique is rare in the world. It could let me live another thousand years!” Xu Tian Dao Ren smiled, his steps closing the distance to less than a thousand zhang.

“An expert in void control!” Luo Tian instantly sensed danger; this Xu Tian Dao Ren was no pushover.

“Dream on!” Luo Tian cursed, his skin prickling with goosebumps.

As the two chased each other, another wave of powerful fluctuations rose from afar—each aura oppressive.

“Too many people; I’m not playing anymore!” Xu Tian Dao Ren smiled, his body vanishing from the spot. The void trembled.

In an instant, Luo Tian felt space twist around him, as if he had fallen into a quagmire. Pressing forces from all sides squeezed him relentlessly.

“Done!” Luo Tian sighed bitterly; if he were at his peak, he could have rushed through. But now, facing a Heavenly King, he had no choice but to surrender.

“Come with me, kid!” Xu Tian Dao Ren, like a ghostly figure, appeared beside Luo Tian and reached for him.

“Die!” Luo Tian turned abruptly, his fist smashing toward Xu Tian Dao Ren.

“Weak as an ant—no matter how strong you were before, now you’re helpless!” Xu Tian Dao Ren sneered, his palm colliding with Luo Tian’s fist.

Boom…

A heavy sound echoed around Luo Tian, his fist caught in Xu Tian Dao Ren’s grip. At the same time, Xu Tian Dao Ren’s other hand unleashed divine laws.

Space compressed; Luo Tian felt invisible hands grasp him, pinning him in the sky.

“Go!” Xu Tian Dao Ren smiled, watching the sect masters rushing toward him.

The void trembled; Xu Tian Dao Ren ignored them, his body flickering as he took Luo Tian into the void.

“Old man, are you trying to possess me?” Luo Tian remained calm, strategizing his chances. If Xu Tian Dao Ren tried to possess him, his strong soul could still fight back.

Luo Tian feared most that Xu Tian Dao Ren would use secret methods to drain his life force and years, leaving him no chance.

“Not right—there’s still a chance. Though my strength has dropped to True Immortal, the Epoch Book can’t be used, but I still have my soul and soul techniques. I’ll strike him unexpectedly!”

“But this old man has lived so long; his soul must be strong!” Luo Tian muttered, sensing great danger. Once this old man had time to act, he would be finished.

“Too fast!” The sect masters’ faces darkened as they watched the trembling void.

“Xu Tian Dao Ren’s void techniques are unmatched; no one can catch him. Moreover, he was once a great power—his strength might even surpass Luo Tian’s peak!” Some sect masters grimaced, surprised that the last piece of meat had fallen into Xu Tian Dao Ren’s hands.

Reluctant as they were, they had no choice. Facing Xu Tian Dao Ren, none of them had confidence—even if some did, they needed to catch him first.

“Little friend, are you so obedient?” Xu Tian Dao Ren smiled, gazing at the bound Luo Tian.

“If yelling could kill you, I’d have already done it!” Luo Tian cursed mentally, thinking of when to strike this old man.

“His control over space is truly formidable!” Luo Tian also marveled internally; this Xu Tian Dao Ren’s mastery of space was absolute, a true master of the void.

Xu Tian Dao Ren’s speed was incredible; Luo Tian, even at his peak, could barely match it.

The scene shifted rapidly—Luo Tian couldn’t see the surroundings clearly, only allowing Xu Tian Dao Ren to lead him away.

After an hour of flight, Luo Tian felt he had traveled far; Xu Tian Dao Ren finally stopped. They seemed to emerge from the heavens.

“Old man, where are you taking me?” Luo Tian quickly asked, his eyes scanning the surroundings. His gaze narrowed slightly.

Before them stood mountain peaks rising high; atop a ten-thousand-zhang peak stood a person—more accurately, an old man.

The old man hunched over, his hands behind his back, long beard flowing, wearing a gray robe and holding a staff. He looked like he was about to die, standing atop the mountain, his gaze fixed on Xu Tian Dao Ren.

“Old ghost!” Xu Tian Dao Ren spoke solemnly, his gaze scanning the surroundings with a heavy expression. The heavens changed.

“He doesn’t want to leave, but he can’t—he’s locked by an absolute killing aura, even affecting the void!” Luo Tian felt a chill; he gazed at the hunched old man on the mountain, sensing an overwhelming killing aura that left him awestruck.

“They know each other!” Luo Tian looked at the hunched old man, his heart rejoicing. He needed someone to clash with Xu Tian Dao Ren so he could seize the opportunity.

Chapter 2587: The Emergence of Shen Suanzi

“You leave, he stays!” The hunched old man lightly tapped his staff, cracks spreading along it. The entire mountain began to fracture.

“I won’t let you leave!” Xu Tian Dao Ren’s eyes darkened, gazing at the hunched old man—evidently they knew each other.

“Life or death!” The hunched old man’s words caused his eyes to narrow; an invisible killing aura materialized, surrounding Xu Tian Dao Ren and Luo Tian.

Xu Tian Dao Ren’s face darkened; he slashed a palm into the void, seemingly casual but Luo Tian saw blood dripping from his fingertips.

“They’re using great techniques!”

“One void technique, one life-destroying technique—these two have mastered their paths for years. Their strength surpasses even a Heavenly King mid-stage, perhaps even matching my peak!” Luo Tian’s mind was in turmoil.

This was true power—Xu Tian Dao Ren and the hunched old man’s emergence left Luo Tian feeling like he had been drenched in cold water.

Luo Tian, once at the Heavenly King level, wasn’t top-tier but was undefeated among his peers. But now, seeing Xu Tian Dao Ren and this hunched old man, he realized he wasn’t undefeated. At least these two were no weaker than him.

As Luo Tian marveled, Xu Tian Dao Ren and the hunched old man’s front had already erupted with thunderous sounds. They simplified their techniques, striking repeatedly, terrifying fluctuations spreading.

Luo Tian’s body shivered; all his hairs stood on end. Two terrifying auras collided, but they avoided him—should one touch him, he knew it wouldn’t be pleasant.

Thus, even though the space force binding him had vanished, he dared not move a muscle, making his situation unbearable.

“But witnessing such power is worth it!” Luo Tian gazed at the confrontation between Xu Tian Dao Ren and the hunched old man, which had become silent again. Yet he could sense their battle was becoming more dangerous.

Two astonishing techniques collided repeatedly, and both Xu Tian Dao Ren and the hunched old man’s mouths gradually bled.

Time passed slowly; Luo Tian felt as if he were in the world of Dao, but this Dao didn’t belong to him—perhaps he couldn’t even comprehend it.

One hour…

Boom! The mountain beneath the hunched old man shattered, crumbling under his feet.

“Another one has come—someone disrupted their techniques!” Luo Tian gazed at the distance, and the hunched old man and Xu Tian Dao Ren also looked there.

“Two elders, greetings!” A young figure stepped through the sky, smiling, wearing a gray robe. His appearance was clean-cut and elegant, resembling a Daoist but far better than Xu Tian Dao Ren—two extremes.

“Kid, who are you?” Xu Tian Dao Ren wiped his mouth, gazing at the youth.

“My name is Su Tong!” The youth smiled all the while, finally gazing at Luo Tian.

“Ghost Valley heir!” Luo Tian locked eyes with the youth, instantly sensing the presence of a Ghost Valley token on him.

“Anyone with a Ghost Valley token can sense my existence!” Luo Tian’s eyes gazed at the youth, surprised that so many powerful enemies had emerged.

“Are there two Ghost Valley heirs? Will they all appear?” Luo Tian felt a bad premonition.

“Are you from Bountiful Heaven Sect?” Xu Tian Dao Ren gazed at the youth, feeling he had seen this person before.

“Shen Suanzi!” Hearing Xu Tian Dao Ren’s words, Luo Tian suddenly remembered and gasped, gazing at the youth with icy eyes.

“Su Tong—yes! But people call him Shen Suanzi, so they’ve forgotten his name is Su Tong!” Luo Tian mentally cried out; he hadn’t expected to meet Shen Suanzi under these circumstances.

“Truly fell into the stepmother’s hands; this is going to be a tough one!” Luo Tian cursed mentally, feeling his predicament was no good.

“I don’t care who you are—should Bountiful Heaven King come, old man won’t let him!” Xu Tian Dao Ren loudly declared, his voice filled with disdain.

“Unexpectedly meeting this way!” Shen Suanzi Su Tong gazed at Luo Tian, his black pupils deep and mysterious. His aura was unique, calm and composed—facing Xu Tian Dao Ren and the hunched old man, he remained at ease.

“This guy is more dangerous than Xu Tian Dao Ren and the hunched old man!” Luo Tian instantly judged and warned himself.

“Why do you always plan against me?” Luo Tian’s face remained unchanged, gazing at Su Tong, memorizing his appearance.

“I am five hundred and thirty years old!”

“At twelve, I awakened my body type and saw the one fate that would be mine—that is you!” Su Tong spoke softly, gazing at Luo Tian.

“Say it and you may not believe it; I didn’t either initially. But the signs later indicated that this fate was very similar to what I saw. To ensure my survival, I must kill you!” Shen Suanzi gazed at Luo Tian, speaking softly.

“Nonsense!” Hearing Su Tong’s words, both Luo Tian and Xu Tian Dao Ren as well as the hunched old man inwardly scoffed; it was too mystical.

“I can’t relax, for I know if I do, this fate will be impossible to pass!”

“Have you heard of the Primordial Heaven and Earth Body?” Su Tong spoke softly.

“Primordial Heaven and Earth Body!” Hearing Su Tong’s words, Xu Tian Dao Ren and the hunched old man’s faces slightly changed; their eyes held shock as they gazed at Su Tong.

“It is the body that naturally draws near to Dao—so it has some credibility!” Xu Tian Dao Ren’s eyes flickered, looking at Luo Tian and Su Tong.

“After saying all this, I want you to know that I’ve planned against you because you are my fate. I must kill you, and at the same time, I am your fate!”

“Thus, I will kill you!” Su Tong took a step toward Luo Tian, his body radiating divine light.

“Little friend, you stay here too!” Xu Tian Dao Ren shouted, his hand forming an incantation. He reached toward Su Tong’s direction, five void cracks suddenly appearing and transforming into blade-like forms, slicing toward Su Tong.

Kill intent became a blade; the hunched old man also continuously manifested, his overwhelming killing aura radiating coldness toward Su Tong.

“Two elders, you are both injured!” Su Tong faced their attacks without fear, his hands moving swiftly. A gray Dao seal radiated overwhelming fluctuations, pushing outward.

Chapter 2588: Shen Suanzi’s Ally

The gray seal collided with the five void cracks and the hunched old man’s life-destroying blade, fluctuations rising and scattering.

Xu Tian Dao Ren and the hunched old man took two steps back, their gazes heavy as they looked at Shen Suanzi.

“Die!” The hunched old man spoke, his words manifesting as law. This time, the old man’s entire body dissolved, a furious killing aura sweeping across heaven and earth. The old man merged with the killing aura, becoming an endless wave of it.

Xu Tian!

Xu Tian Dao Ren also roared, the heavens changing as he transformed himself into Dao. The sky above Luo Tian trembled instantly.

Su Tong’s eyes showed a hint of smile, gazing at the ever-changing heavens and the overwhelming killing aura surrounding him.

The sound of contention arose; Su Tong raised his hand, drawing a gray long sword. The sword was three feet and three inches long, its entire body gray with intricate seals engraved on it.

Su Tong raised his hand and swung the sword, a gray blade’s aura slicing through the heavens. The second strike followed swiftly; Su Tong seemed to enter a state, allowing space and killing aura to attack him without hindrance. He still struck with one sword.

The entire world fell into silence; Luo Tian stood there, watching Su Tong’s graceful sword movements. He admired it internally.

The Dao law was natural; each strike Su Tong made contained the ultimate truth of Dao, its power astonishing. Yet it appeared simple.

“This Shen Suanzi’s strength is certainly a match for Yang Huanyu; even if I use Ten Thousand Dao Alone, I can’t defeat him!” Luo Tian muttered to himself.

Su Tong’s sword movements flowed like water; if not for knowing Su Tong was fighting, one might think he was just dancing with his sword—too perfect. Each strike was aesthetically pleasing.

But Luo Tian knew the danger within it; three people were battling Dao laws—should one lose, they would suffer severe injuries or even death.

Time passed slowly; after an hour, Su Tong’s mouth bled, and his sword movements slowed significantly.

“Two elders must win!” Luo Tian mentally prayed; Su Tong wanted to kill him, and these two old men used him for longevity. Compared to this, Luo Tian naturally hoped Xu Tian Dao Ren and the hunched old man would win.

Yet, Luo Tian’s heart was also uneasy; Su Tong gave him a terrifying feeling—someone with tenfold confidence in their moves, who would succeed if they struck. Since he wanted to kill Luo Tian, he must have had a perfect plan.

As Su Tong’s sword movements slowed, the fierce killing aura also dispersed somewhat; the void gradually emitted thunderous sounds.

“Hold on, must hold on!” Luo Tian mentally shouted; suddenly, a sense of crisis appeared in his mind.

Su Tong’s face showed a smile, gazing at Luo Tian, and he extended his hand to strike. A gray blade’s aura flew toward Luo Tian.

“Damn it!” Almost simultaneously, three angry shouts echoed—Luo Tian, Xu Tian Dao Ren, and the hunched old man.

Plop…

Su Tong spat blood, struck by killing aura and void blades on his body. His back had two deep wounds; the divine laws around them surged, causing Su Tong’s body to tremble violently.

Yet, Su Tong’s face remained smiling, gazing at the blade flying toward Luo Tian because this strike was certain to hit Luo Tian.

In a life-or-death crisis, Luo Tian unleashed his power, making the correct response—unleashing the Wheel of Rebirth.

“Hum…”

The black Wheel of Rebirth suddenly expanded, appearing before Luo Tian. The terrifying blade’s aura also struck it.

Crack…

A thunderous sound echoed through the world; although Luo Tian couldn’t activate the Wheel of Rebirth, he could let it block most attacks.

The blade’s aura exploded against the Wheel of Rebirth, and the overwhelming fluctuations collided with it. The Wheel of Rebirth also struck Luo Tian, making him feel as if he had been hit by a high-speed mountain.

“Ah…” Luo Tian roared, but no sound came out; blood spewed from his mouth like money.

Boom! The Wheel of Rebirth carried Luo Tian and smashed into a mountain, instantly shattering it. Stones flew everywhere, dust swirling.

On the other side, Shen Suanzi also fell from the sky, his body crashing into the ground. He had endured Xu Tian Dao Ren and the hunched old man’s attacks, but it wasn’t easy.

Severely wounded…

Luo Tian lay on the ground, feeling his body was no longer his. His soul felt unstable and about to drift away.

A Heavenly King early-stage’s full-force strike, and it was Shen Suanzi—Luo Tian would have been cautious even at his peak. Now, he was in dire straits.

“I’m going to die!” Luo Tian sighed mentally; his misfortune was absurd, dying in a pitiful way. That strike hadn’t killed him because the Wheel of Rebirth had blocked most attacks. If there was no Wheel of Rebirth, he would have been annihilated by Shen Suanzi’s attack.

At this moment, Luo Tian felt extremely weak; if not rescued, he might truly die. But as long as his soul was safe, he could enter reincarnation. However, Luo Tian didn’t want to—once he entered reincarnation, it would bring more variables. Moreover, after rebirth, Bailing and Wuchang would use heavenly power to gather his body. It wouldn’t be as strong as this one, and he might permanently stay at the Heavenly King middle stage. None of these were what Luo Tian wanted.

“Little friend, you’re asking for death!” Xu Tian Dao Ren and the hunched old man appeared, seeing Su Tong standing up, his face pale.

“Die? I won’t die; it’s you two who will die, having lived so long—your time should have ended!” Su Tong smiled, his wounds rapidly healing and returning to normal.

“This…” Seeing Su Tong return to normal, Xu Tian Dao Ren and the hunched old man showed disbelief.

They had lived too long; they needed longevity, and Su Tong’s methods had shown them hope to continue living for a long time.

“Follow me; I’ll let you live on. Otherwise, die!” Su Tong changed his demeanor, gazing at Xu Tian Dao Ren and the hunched old man.

“Hum…” A fluctuation spread; two figures tore through the heavens, appearing beside Xu Tian Dao Ren and the hunched old man. Their auras locked onto them, making their faces grim.

The two figures wore black robes, middle-aged men with smiles in their eyes, gazing at Xu Tian Dao Ren and the hunched old man.

“Long time no see; I didn’t expect you two to still be alive!” A playful voice echoed in Xu Tian Dao Ren and the hunched old man’s ears, causing them to show confusion.

Chapter 2589: The Three Uncles

“Unexpectedly, the legendary assassin Cold Heartless (Leng Wu Xin) has become like this—about to die, not living another century!” One middle-aged man spoke, his eyes full of admiration.

“Who are you?” Seeing the two middle-aged men call out their names, especially the hunched old man who rarely appeared, only a few knew his name. That these two men knew it meant they were likely from their era.

“Tong Tieyi, you are Tong Tieyi? How is it possible!” Xu Tian Dao Ren’s body suddenly froze, gazing at a middle-aged man with an elegant appearance. His eyes showed disbelief.

“Iron-handed Indifferent, Tong Tieyi?” Hearing Xu Tian Dao Ren’s words, the hunched old man first showed confusion, then his eyes also revealed shock.

“Yes, it’s me!” The middle-aged man was satisfied with Xu Tian Dao Ren and Leng Wu Xin’s shock.

“Are you the ruthless doctor, Zhao Gengxu?” Leng Wu Xin gazed at another middle-aged man, his eyes filled with shock.

“Leng Wu Xin, the account from that time—today we must settle it!” Zhao Gengxu’s face showed anger, gazing at Leng Wu Xin.

“Did you think I was dead?”

“I did die, but I’ve come back to life!” Zhao Gengxu smiled, his eyes coldly gazing at Xu Tian Dao Ren and Leng Wu Xin.

“Enough of the reunion; you two, choose to follow me or die—your choice!” Shen Suanzi Su Tong’s eyes showed a hint of smile, stepping toward Luo Tian.

“Of course, if you follow me, you can be like them!” Shen Suanzi continued speaking without looking at Xu Tian Dao Ren and Leng Wu Xin, knowing they would agree.

Indeed, after thinking for a while, Xu Tian Dao Ren and Leng Wu Xin nodded in agreement.

To live—Xu Tian Dao Ren and Leng Wu Xin, having lived this long, their only goal was to live.

Tong Tieyi and Zhao Gengxu’s current state clearly showed they were full of vitality, unlike Xu Tian Dao Ren and Leng Wu Xin who seemed to be dying.

“Longevity—who doesn’t want it?” Their eyes showed excitement.

As for Zhao Gengxu and Leng Wu Xin’s grudge, the others wouldn’t care. After so long, seeing people from their era was rare; let alone being in the same faction now.

“This fate, I’ve passed!” Shen Suanzi Su Tong sighed, walking toward the fallen Luo Tian.

Su Tong extended his hand to finish off Luo Tian’s life, but Luo Tian wore a bitter smile, lacking the strength to fight back.

Death felt invaded his perception; he gazed at the white hand approaching him, feeling his life dwindling.

“Ten zhang… eight zhang…”

“Take your dirty hand away!” Just as Su Tong’s hand was about to strike Luo Tian, a cold voice echoed. Divine light flashed, and three streaks of light appeared.

“Hum…”

A green light burst out, instantly appearing beside Luo Tian. Su Tong withdrew his hand to dodge the divine light attack, frowning slightly.

Three figures wore silver robes, radiating starlight—two middle-aged men and a youth. The youth carried an arrogant aura.

The two middle-aged men—one had a solemn face, the other radiated iron-blooded intent. Seeing Su Tong and Xu Tian Dao Ren’s group, their faces slightly straightened.

“Ye Wudao!” Su Tong gazed at the two middle-aged men, while ignoring the youth.

“Father!” Luo Tian’s face showed joy, seeing the three standing before him—Ye Wudao, Ye Tian, and Ye Liangchen from Star River Sect.

“Big Brother!” Ye Liangchen approached Luo Tian, seeing his pitiful state, his eyes filled with anger.

“Kid, how did you get so messed up?” Ye Tian waved his hand, a streak of starlight landing in Luo Tian’s mouth.

“This is Star River Sect’s Star River Pills; there are only three, capable of reviving the dead!” Ye Tian spoke softly, placing the pill into Luo Tian’s mouth.

Luo Tian couldn’t speak, only swallowing the pill. Instantly, he felt a surge of energy within his body, rapidly nourishing his injuries.

“Liangchen, take Little Tian away first!” Ye Wudao spoke to Ye Liangchen, grabbing a star sword that appeared in his hand. Ye Tian also radiated an icy aura.

“Run? Just you two?” Hearing Ye Wudao’s words, Tong Tieyi and the others showed disdain. Ye Wudao and Ye Tian were strong, but who were they? Old ghosts who had lived for tens of thousands of years. Though their strength had declined, they wouldn’t take Ye Wudao and Ye Tian seriously.

“Hum…” As he spoke, a green light flashed; Zhao Gengxu took out a wooden sword and slashed toward Ye Wudao and Ye Tian.

At the same time, Xu Tian Dao Ren and Leng Wu Xin also attacked—after all, they had just followed Su Tong and wanted to show enough sincerity.

In an instant, four martial techniques with powerful divine laws surged toward Luo Tian.

“Block it!” Ye Wudao punched, a meteor rising and striking Xu Tian Dao Ren with a great seal. His other hand held the star sword, slicing toward the attacking blade.

Boom boom…

The thunderous sound echoed again as Ye Wudao and Ye Tian began to block the attacks from Xu Tian Dao Ren and the others.

“Run!” Ye Liangchen lifted Luo Tian, stepping on the ground and flying toward the distance.

But Ye Liangchen hadn’t flown a thousand zhang before, Su Tong appeared in front of him and slashed toward him.

“You can’t escape; I’ve already calculated this!”

“Big Brother, hold on a little longer—I’ll kill this kid first and then we’ll run!” Ye Liangchen placed Luo Tian down.

Luo Tian was already somewhat recovered, though he couldn’t walk, his face had improved significantly. Luo Tian estimated that within another hour, his injuries would recover.

“Honestly, you’ve hidden deep—even I thought you were a spoiled brat!” Su Tong saw Ye Liangchen, and as he placed Luo Tian down, he raised his hand to strike again toward Ye Liangchen. He naturally knew that only by killing Ye Liangchen could he kill Luo Tian.

“I’ve hidden many things!” Ye Liangchen’s hands formed seals, and with a roar, a massive meteor fell from the sky, colliding with Su Tong’s blade.

Boom… The meteor shattered, weakened, and fell onto Ye Liangchen’s shoulder.

Chapter 2590: Ye Sheng Appears

Ye Liangchen’s body retreated, his gaze focused on Su Tong, blood flowing from his shoulder as if he hadn’t noticed.

“I don’t believe I can’t escape!” Ye Liangchen formed seals, and the sky instantly darkened. Stars appeared, moving rapidly.

Ye Liangchen’s body flickered, merging into the stars, making it impossible to see his movements.

Su Tong’s eyes narrowed slightly; he gazed at the stars, a look of interest on his face.

“Roar…” As Su Tong observed, a roar echoed out. Starlight converged; the stars coalesced into a massive bear, roaring toward Su Tong.

Boom…

The massive bear’s paw shattered the void, instantly descending upon Su Tong. Su Tong’s eyes slightly lifted; his gray long sword danced, its aura forming a massive gray snake. The snake’s tail lashed toward the bear’s paw.

Boom…

A thunderous sound echoed; the bear was knocked back, starlight scattering across the world.

Sss…

As the bear just steadied itself, the snake struck again, its long body wrapping around the bear. The body writhed, and a crunching sound echoed from the bear’s body.

Boom boom boom…

In an instant, the bear’s body shattered, scattering into starlight. In the starlight, Ye Liangchen’s mouth bled; obviously, he had been wounded from the confrontation.
