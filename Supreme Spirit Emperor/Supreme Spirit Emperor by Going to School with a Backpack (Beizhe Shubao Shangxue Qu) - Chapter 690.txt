“Sit down!” Three late-stage Immortal Kings sneered, their presence radiating pressure as the sect masters behind them also unleashed their authority. Jiang Sxi and others halted their movements.

“Master Chu, I beg you to let me fight alongside the masters of Yongsheng Mountain!” A middle-aged man stepped forward, addressing Chu Kaihe. He was Meng Qingyun, the sect master of Hongchen Sect.

Hongchen Sect had lost tens of thousands of disciples; Meng Qingyun could not help but resent Chen Tianqi for bringing Luotian, a blight, into their sect. Yet he dared not voice his anger, instead directing his resentment toward the disciples of Tianyuan Sect.

“Go,” Chu Kaihe did not stop them, allowing Meng Qingyun and a late-stage Immortal King from Yongsheng Mountain to exit the hall.

“Kill!” In an instant, Nan Gong Yuqing and others rushed out of the hall. Naturally, Chu Kaihe allowed them to proceed; late-stage Immortal Kings’ pressure descended upon them, with several sect masters standing at the hall’s entrance.

“Nan Gong Yuqing, return!” Xiang Tianming’s face darkened, his expression as gloomy as blood. The situation was dire; if mishandled, Tianyuan Sect might be lost entirely.

“Too sudden! These people attacked without giving us a chance to react!” Xiang Tianming transmitted mentally to his companions, ordering Nan Gong Yuqing and others to stop.

“Ah…” A piercing scream echoed through Tianyuan Sect as two early-stage Immortal Kings began slaughtering its disciples.

The blood-soaked aroma instantly filled the hall, making Nan Gong Yuqing’s group’s eyes turn crimson and their breaths heavy.

Crack… Crack…

They clenched their fists, frustration evident in their eyes. If Tianyuan Sect disciples died on the battlefield, they would say nothing; but this manner of death was unbearable.

“Master, save us!” A desperate cry echoed into the hall, laced with despair.

“Can’t hold back anymore!” Nan Gong Yuqing roared, his black sword in hand. He glared at the sect masters at the hall’s entrance and slashed fiercely.

“Foolish!” Seeing Nan Gong Yuqing attack, Chu Kaihe flicked his finger, sending a divine beam that shattered the black sword’s aura.

Boom…

The hall trembled violently, on the verge of collapse.

“Stay here. If you don’t want Tianyuan Sect to be destroyed, stay put!” Chu Kaihe sneered.

“Master hasn’t abandoned us!” Seeing the hall’s trembling and hearing Chu Kaihe’s words, Tianyuan Sect disciples understood.

“Still two million left. Meng, it’s up to you!” The early-stage Immortal King from Yongsheng Mountain smiled, disdainfully tossing aside a Tianyuan Sect disciple’s corpse.

“Understood!” Meng Qingyun nodded, charging like a tiger into a flock of sheep toward Tianyuan Sect disciples.

“Foolish!” As Meng Qingyun resumed his slaughter, a thunderous roar echoed over Tianyuan Sect. A crimson divine light flashed, instantly descending upon Meng Qingyun’s head, making his face pale.

A blood-red sword aura, radiating immense pressure, met Meng Qingyun’s blade instinctively.

Crack…

Thunderous sound erupted above Meng Qingyun, his body kneeling to the ground, knees sinking into it with cracks spreading. The Tianyuan Sect disciples beside him were struck by an invisible force, scattering without being caught in the violent turbulence.

“Seems I was too merciful!” A cold voice echoed. Four figures descended from the sky—Luo Tian and his three companions returning to Tianyuan Sect.

Chapter 2576: Assertiveness

“Master!” The Tianyuan Sect disciples, seeing Luo Tian and his companions, erupted in cheers. Their eyes held joy as they gazed at Luo Tian. Though years had passed, most of Tianyuan Sect still remembered Luo Tian and habitually addressed him as Master.

“Luo Tian!” Meng Qingyun and the early-stage Immortal King from Yongsheng Mountain shuddered, gazing at Luo Tian and his companions radiating fierce killing intent.

“Die!” Without hesitation, Luo Tian unleashed the Ten Thousand Swords Cycle, enveloping both in its pressure. The early-stage Immortal King and Meng Qingyun were instantly immobilized.

Luo Tian pointed his finger at Meng Qingyun, making his face grim.

“Master Luo, this is a misunderstanding!” Meng Qingyun shouted, feeling he could not withstand this single finger.

Buzz…

Luo Tian gave no chance for explanation. He pressed his finger onto Meng Qingyun, who exploded into a mist of blood, scattering across the ground.

Difference!

Luo Tian now approached late-stage Immortal King level. The Ten Thousand Swords Cycle was an unparalleled domain, surpassing all mid-stage Immortal Kings’ domains. Meng Qingyun, merely early-stage, was a mere mortal before Luo Tian—vast disparity.

The early-stage Immortal King from Yongsheng Mountain trembled in mind, staring at Luo Tian’s fierce demeanor. He rushed toward the hall.

But as he reached the entrance, Yaochen and Chen Zhanbiao blocked his path. A staff and a hammer struck him, breaking his chest with a crack.

The early-stage Immortal King spat blood, flying backward like a broken kite to land on the ground.

“Every disciple and elder of Tianyuan Sect, evacuate beyond ten thousand miles!” Luo Tian declared. He stepped forward, crushing the early-stage Immortal King’s body with a single footstep.

“Luo Tian!” As Luo Tian crushed the early-stage Immortal King, the hall collapsed in a burst of debris. Its occupants emerged into Luo Tian’s view.

Jiang Sxi and others gazed at Luo Tian, whose aura surged. They leapt into the air, standing behind him.

At the same time, Tianyuan Sect disciples gathered toward Mount Tianyuan, awaiting Luo Tian’s orders.

“Thank you,” Luo Tian’s eyes showed gratitude. He knew that during his absence, they had sacrificed much to achieve Tianyuan Sect’s current might.

But now he was back, his strength greatly enhanced. He would protect what remained.

“Luo Tian, you dare return? You seek death!” Chu Kaihe roared, his voice laced with fury. Yongsheng Mountain had lost three early-stage Immortal Kings at Luo Tian’s hands—this was a massive loss.

Yet this late-stage Immortal King did not underestimate him. He remembered the battle at Yongsheng Mountain, which had left a deep impression.

“Indeed! Luo Tian, you are the blight of the Immortal realm. Today is your end!” An early-stage Immortal King sect master shouted.

Others also roared in unison. Though Luo Tian had shown great strength, they now had three late-stage Immortal Kings, three mid-stage ones, and several early-stage ones—superior in strength to Tianyuan Sect.

This was an opportunity, a chance to destroy Tianyuan Sect. Rarely had the Nine Great Mountains united against one sect. If Tianyuan Sect recovered, they would face trouble later. Thus, these men wished to ignite the conflict.

“Why have you come to Tianyuan Sect?” Luo Tian coldly asked, not yet ready to fight. Tianyuan Sect disciples had not fully evacuated; if they fought, it would be like the Red Dust Sect’s fate.

“Kill!” Chu Kaihe moved, his green domain expanding to cover ten thousand feet. He enveloped Luo Tian and struck with a palm.

Chu Kaihe did not believe Luo Tian could again unleash formidable combat power. He thought those techniques were one-time only.

Moreover, they had three late-stage Immortal Kings. Before coming, they had agreed to eliminate Tianyuan Sect, using it as a warning to demonstrate the Nine Great Mountains’ authority.

A single strike from a late-stage Immortal King could shake heaven and earth. A green hand obscured the sky, like a patch of green clouds, rushing toward Luo Tian.

Xiang Tianming sneered and struck with his hand. Waves of blue surged, colliding with Chu Kaihe’s palm.

The sky roared; the earth trembled. Two hands shattered in people’s awe, becoming gusts of wind that struck everyone.

“Who are these people?” Luo Tian asked Jiang Sxi and others, addressing them. He had met Chu Kaihe before; the other two mid-stage Immortal Kings he hadn’t.

“This is Fu Zhengyan from Eastern Emperor Mountain, this is Wu Li of the Ghost King Sect, and this is...” Jiang Sxi introduced them.

Except for Bontian Mountain, the others had arrived. With so many sect masters, they dared to fight Tianyuan Sect.

“Some trouble,” Luo Tian said. “You all find a way to evacuate Tianyuan Sect disciples!”

Luo Tian waved his hand, sending a streak of light to Wanyingkong’s hands.

“Depend on you!” Luo Tian told Wanyingkong, trusting his ability.

“This is!” Wanyingkong’s face changed, then turned to joy. He laughed loudly.

“Rest assured, I have tenfold confidence!” Wanyingkong vowed, flying toward Mount Tianyuan.

He had long prepared a massive array to transport many at once. But it was too difficult. However, with the Wheel of Transference, he had great confidence in activating the super array.

“Luo Tian, if you self-terminate here, we might spare Tianyuan Sect. Otherwise, according to the laws of the great Immortal Kings, your sect will lose ten thousand lives daily!” Chu Kaihe declared coldly.

“Try if you dare!” Luo Tian was not in a hurry. He wanted Wanyingkong enough time. Once the transport array activated, they would certainly block it.

“But you killed my Yongsheng Mountain elder and Red Dust Sect master. We’ve decided to kill another ten thousand!” Chu Kaihe said, voice icy.

“Fight then! What’s the point of talking?” Yaochen roared, flying forward to attack those sect masters.

“Indeed! Dare you? Daring to harm one of Tianyuan Sect, try!” Nan Gong Yuqing also could not hold back. He rushed forward with his demon sword.

“Both of you, return!” Luo Tian roared, grabbing Yaochen and Nan Gong Yuqing back.

“I am the one who killed them. I have already left Tianyuan Sect, so I will bear this!” Luo Tian shouted, gazing at them.

Chapter 2577: Battle with Chu Kaihe

“Stay put!” Luo Tian told Nan Gong Yuqing and others. If a chaotic fight broke out, they would suffer injuries. Luo Tian did not want to see those he valued most harmed.

“Let’s do this—stand here. Settle scores, settle grudges!”

“Of course, if you want to attack in a group, my friends won’t stand by!” Luo Tian smiled and took a step forward.

“Who gave you the courage?” Chu Kaihe frowned, scanning his sect masters. He saw their fearful expressions.

“I’ll see if you’ve improved over the years!” Chu Kaihe flew forward, rushing toward Luo Tian. His hand glowed with divine light, and a green sword materialized in his grasp.

“Move aside!” Luo Tian roared without fear, his blood sword erupting. His body vanished from the spot.

In an instant, two swords clashed. Luo Tian’s body retreated, his palm trembling as he took two steps back.

“Indeed strong!” Chu Kaihe felt a chill. Though Luo Tian was still mid-stage Immortal King, he had improved significantly compared to when he ascended Yongsheng Mountain. Though not as strong as late-stage, he was close to it.

Chu Kaihe did not underestimate him. His aura coalesced, and his sword hummed with a resonant sound. His power surged.

“This kid only hacks randomly; he’s not skilled in swords,” Chu Kaihe, not a pushover, observed. As a late-stage Immortal King and pillar of Yongsheng Mountain, his discernment was sharp. He quickly identified Luo Tian’s weakness.

“I’ll suppress him with sword mastery,” Chu Kaihe thought. His sword glowed with divine laws, radiating an immense aura.

“Master Chu intends to subdue Luo Tian with sword mastery!”

“Master Chu’s sword intent is quite remarkable,” Fu Zhengyan observed, watching the coalescing aura of Chu Kaihe.

Buzz…

As people marveled, Chu Kaihe moved. A green sword aura cleaved the sky. The entire world stilled; immense pressure made Luo Tian’s face grim.

Luo Tian held his blood sword above his head, clashing with the descending blade. In people’s awe, Luo Tian felt a thunderous explosion in his ears, and he continuously retreated.

Step by step…

Footprints rose beneath Luo Tian’s feet, leaving people in awe. At the Immortal King level, power is mastered and refined. Luo Tian’s footprints indicated he had taken this strike very seriously.

“Second stage of sword mastery, yet he endured!” Chu Kaihe was amazed Luo Tian had no injuries. He expected the mountain beneath them to be buried, and Luo Tian would spit blood.

Clang…

Luo Tian’s arm was numb. His blood sword fell to the ground, and he spat blood. He marveled at Chu Kaihe’s strength.

“Still a gap!” Luo Tian frowned, watching Chu Kaihe’s sword radiate overwhelming power. He quickly retrieved his blood sword.

In an instant, the third strike erupted—a green crescent moon-like blade, ten zhang long, slicing down onto Luo Tian’s head.

This time, Luo Tian’s blood sword was shattered and embedded into the void. His face distorted as if countless blades scraped his body. The mountain beneath him finally crumbled.

Spit…

Blood spewed from Luo Tian’s mouth like water, dust swirling into the sky. Thunderous sounds echoed across eight directions.

Far beyond Tianyuan Sect, on a vast land, divine patterns flowed. Array flags fluttered. A black wheel lay at the array’s center, rotating slowly.

The array was immense, spanning several million square li. Outside it stood Tianyuan Sect disciples, their eyes filled with worry as they heard the booming sounds.

“Battle has begun. Are they opponents?” Tianyuan Sect disciples looked worried.

Wanyingkong’s forehead was drenched in sweat. He moved through the array, calculating constantly and placing flags.

“Wanyingkong, how much longer?” Diaodezhu flew over and asked.

“Three hours. Can you hold for three hours? And divide into three batches—two million per batch, directly transported to Tianlan Sect’s battlefield!”

“Also, don’t talk to me like that!” Wanyingkong did not look at Diaodezhu, shouting instead. He continued moving through the array, occasionally gesturing and placing flags.

“Fourth strike!” On another side, Chu Kaihe did not give Luo Tian a chance to react. He suddenly slashed.

“Mingsheng Sword!” Chu Kaihe roared, not only sword mastery but also a martial technique.

The sky trembled; the world thundered. The green blade radiated overwhelming divine power. Before it appeared, Luo Tian felt a chill.

“Seems I must use the sword!” Luo Tian retrieved his blood sword, and Duanjian Zhuxian appeared in his hand.

“What is this sword? He has no weapon, using such a broken iron?” People sneered at Luo Tian’s Zhuxian sword.

“Understandable. He died on Yongsheng Mountain, leaving everything behind!” People whispered.

But before they finished speaking, their eyes widened. Duanjian Zhuxian erupted with overwhelming sword intent. A series of sword auras descended from Luo Tian’s domain, gathering onto his long sword.

A sky-piercing aura surged upward. Black auras carried overwhelming power, violently expanding to destroy heaven and earth. It clashed with Chu Kaihe’s blade.

Boom…

Everyone felt a thunderous explosion in their ears. Their heads swam; storms tore through the void. The sky above them exploded under this collision.

Cough… Cough…

The entire Tianyuan Mountain was shattered in this clash. Amidst the dust, figures stood battered.

“Our home is gone!” Far away, Tianyuan Sect disciples looked sorrowfully at the shattered Tianyuan Mountain. It was their home, where they had lived.

“When will we no longer have to flee? Is there no place for us?” People felt bitter. Most had moved from the Star Domain to Lower Three Heavens, then fought their way into Middle Three Heavens. Now they had to move again.

Chapter 2578: Blood Battle

“Yongsheng Gate!” Chu Kaihe roared, raising his green gate to crush the swirling dust.

“Still alive?” Everyone gasped. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to survive such a powerful attack.

“Roar…” A black vortex rose, sucking in the dust. It revealed Luo Tian standing with his hands clasped in a gesture.

At this moment, Luo Tian’s robes were torn. His face was pale, with bloodstains on his chest. His hands moved constantly.

A black giant claw extended from the vortex, reaching toward Yongsheng Gate and grabbing it fiercely.

Boom…

Another thunderous explosion. Luo Tian’s body flew back, but he expanded to a thousand zhang in height—his Law of the World Body.

“Fury of the Barbarian God, Trampling Nine Heavens!” Luo Tian roared. He unleashed his seventh step, rushing toward Chu Kaihe.

Chu Kaihe remained calm. He raised his hand to grasp Luo Tian’s descending foot.

Boom…

A dull sound echoed. Chu Kaihe’s massive hand had caught Luo Tian’s foot. The earth collapsed; Chu Kaihe’s qi surged, and he roared, lifting Luo Tian’s massive body to smash it onto the ground.

The thunderous sound was overwhelming. Luo Tian’s massive body fell like a mountain.

Luo Tian immediately stood up, his head dizzy but he took another step. The result remained unchanged.

Third step… Fifth step…

“Brainless, determined to die?”

“Or is your technique all you have? This martial art is strong enough to crush mid-stage Immortal Kings, but it’s not enough to defeat a late-stage one!” People whispered. Though they felt Luo Tian’s seventh step was formidable, it wasn’t enough to defeat a late-stage Immortal King like Chu Kaihe.

Boom… Boom…

Seven steps. By the seventh, Chu Kaihe’s body trembled and he retreated. Luo Tian’s body shattered and fell to the ground.

“Now it’s my turn!”

“You’re the first to make me this exhausted!” Chu Kaihe smiled, holding his sword. His blade glowed with divine power, radiating overwhelming might.

The green blade’s patterns flowed, a strange mark imbued on it. This made the green blade even stronger. The entire world turned green, with lush vitality floating in the air.

Boom… Boom…

Vitality surged. The ruins suddenly sprouted trees, standing tall in the world.

“Regeneration Sword, Dominion of Blades!” Chu Kaihe roared. His arms expanded, clearly unleashing his full power. This strike would destroy heaven and earth.

“Single Sword Against Heaven!” Luo Tian felt immense pressure, unleashing his strongest single combat technique. His cultivation was drained by half. Black auras cut through the green expanse, clashing with the green blade.

The world fell silent. In people’s awe, Luo Tian and Chu Kaihe’s attacks collided again. A violent storm surged upward, striking both men.

Luo Tian felt his internal organs rupture; blood spilled from his mouth. His body fell into the storm.

How long he drifted, Luo Tian finally felt his body lighten and fall to the ground.

On another side, Chu Kaihe’s condition was no better. He lay on the ground, his body riddled with sword qi, turning into a bloodied man.

“End!” Chu Kaihe slowly stood up. His eyes were weak, holding his sword as he walked toward Luo Tian.

“With a mid-stage Immortal King, you’ve pushed a late-stage one like me this far. That’s truly astonishing. But there is still a gap!” Wu Li’s voice was hoarse, gazing at Luo Tian lying there.

“Master Chu’s divine might is unmatched!” A chorus of voices echoed from the sect masters of the Middle Three Heavens. To them, Tianyuan Sect would be destroyed today.

Once Luo Tian was dead, these people would surely become frenzied. Then Master Chu and the others would finish them off.

“Such talent, yet you still need Master Chu to deal with him? I wish I had dealt with him earlier!” One sect master sneered. After all, Luo Tian looked like he was about to die, and he could mock him freely.

“You’re nothing!” Nan Gong Yuqing and others glared at the sect master, making him shudder.

Xiang Tianming stepped forward toward Luo Tian. He couldn’t let Luo Tian be killed here.

“Don’t!” As Xiang Tianming just moved, Luo Tian suddenly stood up. He raised his broken sword above his head.

Crack…

Sword and blade clashed. Luo Tian retreated again, as did Chu Kaihe. His eyes showed surprise—Luo Tian still had the strength to fight.

Kill…

At the same time, Luo Tian and Chu Kaihe roared. They rushed toward each other, their swords clashing.

This time, neither had the previous intensity; they simply slashed, as if exhausted.

Time passed slowly…

“Two and a half hours have passed. These two still fight. Do they plan to battle for days?” People marveled.

“Though it’s normal for strong warriors to fight for days, usually they test first before fighting. But Luo Tian and Chu Kaihe seem the opposite.” People whispered.

“Kid, you can’t hold on. Let me kill you!” Chu Kaihe kept speaking, slashing down a blade that wounded Luo Tian’s shoulder. His arm was also cut by Luo Tian.

“Not yet. Wait until the time comes, and I’ll send you to the afterlife!” Luo Tian’s face was weary. Though lifting his arm seemed difficult, each time he could block Chu Kaihe’s attack.

One hour… Half an hour… One hour…

Finally, three hours passed. A surge of energy rose beyond the battlefield. Golden divine light shot into the sky, shaking heaven and earth. Two million Tianyuan Sect disciples rushed toward the array.

“What are they doing?” Many Middle Three Heavens sect masters were stunned, gazing at the sky with flowing divine patterns. Each carried immense power.

“Worldly power!”

“This vast worldly power, this massive spatial tremor. Could it be…” Fu Zhengyan gazed at the distance.

“Transportation! Tianyuan Sect is transporting, and it’s at least hundreds of thousands!” Wu Li’s forehead split open a terrifying eye. He gasped.

“Is it beginning? Then I’ll begin too!” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at Chu Kaihe rushing toward him again.

Chapter 2579: Sword Slaying the World

Under the sky, a golden light shot into the heavens. Within several million square li, array flags were planted on the ground, emitting waves of power.

At the center of the array stood a black wheel. It rotated slowly, with divine patterns floating upward, carrying mysterious power.

“Hurry! Hurry!” Wanyingkong stood outside the array, shouting at Tianyuan Sect disciples. His voice was urgent.

Numerous figures rushed into the array, filling it completely.

Two million people. With prior preparation, they entered the array in dozens of breaths.

“Open!” Wanyingkong roared. Golden array flags flew up, landing on the black wheel’s center.

The array activated. Overwhelming spatial power acted upon the two million people, causing violent tremors in space. A fierce wind surged out of the array.

Buzz…

A loud buzz echoed. Two million people twisted, and in a flash, they vanished from the array.

“Hurry! Second batch!” Wanyingkong shouted. His eyes showed joy. He knew the first group had successfully transferred, but the second and third batches were the hardest. Such a commotion could not avoid alerting those on Luo Tian’s side.

Moreover, due to the previous windstorms, Tianyuan Sect disciples were scattered. To quickly get two million back into the array required time.

“Damn! How could there be such a massive transportation array!” Middle Three Heavens sect masters gasped. Their eyes held disbelief, gazing at the golden light.

Everyone was stunned. They had never seen such a transportation array capable of moving so many people—unheard of in their lives.

“Don’t let Tianyuan Sect escape!” Fu Zhengyan roared, flying toward the transportation array of Tianyuan Sect.

“Don’t go!” But Fu Zhengyan had barely taken off when a figure blocked his path—Xiang Tianming, a late-stage Immortal King.

Wu Li also took flight. Two figures blocked Wu Li’s path—Lu Chong and Huo Zhu Meng Wushuang.

“Fight! Tianyuan Sect is fleeing to hell. Let’s all attack!” A sect master shouted, and others responded.

“Foolish!” In an instant, Yaochen and Nan Gong Yuqing rushed out. The battle erupted immediately.

“Everyone, get back!” Wanyingkong shouted at them. He ordered Jiang Sxi, Gu Qianxue, and Sun Mengru to organize entry into the array. He rushed over, his hands moving rapidly, casting divine laws.

Power surged. In an instant, array flags appeared before the entering Tianyuan Sect disciples.

Tianyuan Sect had prepared beforehand. These flags were planted by Wanyingkong, meant to prevent emergencies.

“Retreat!” Hearing Wanyingkong’s words, Nan Gong Yuqing and others retreated without lingering. They returned to the array.

Only Luo Tian and Xiang Tianming remained outside the array, as they knew Wanyingkong’s array was barely enough to withstand late-stage Immortal Kings. They were responsible for blocking the late-stage ones.

Middle Three Heavens sect masters chased after Nan Gong Yuqing’s group, reaching the array’s edge. Wanyingkong stood within the array, holding a command flag. He waved his hand.

Crash…

Thunder surged. A series of world-destroying lightning descended, striking the sect masters and halting their advance.

“Everyone attack! Break his array!” A sect master shouted. His hands moved rapidly, forming a martial technique that struck toward the array.

Others also attacked, gathering techniques to attack Wanyingkong’s array. Nan Gong Yuqing and others did not idle, standing within the array with each holding a command flag. They seemed to have gained power, enhancing their martial techniques.

The booming sound echoed across the eight directions. A violent wave of destruction rose, as if entering an apocalypse.

On another side, Luo Tian still fought against Chu Kaihe. Xiang Tianming and Fu Zhengyan, Meng Wushuang, and Lu Chong fought against Wu Li.

Yet Luo Tian’s group was at a disadvantage. The gap with Chu Kaihe and the others was significant.

Life returned, and Chu Kaihe raised his sword again. He finally unleashed a technique.

“Sword Slaying the World!” Luo Tian roared, his Zhuxian sword erupting. Countless sword auras spread before him, radiating overwhelming divine light.

One of the three sword techniques of the Fallen Immortal King. Now Luo Tian could fully perform the second form, the Ten Thousand Swords Cycle. This elevated his sword art to the fourth stage of sword mastery. As he was nearly a late-stage Immortal King, he could now perform this second technique.

The divine sword hummed. As Luo Tian poured his cultivation into it, Zhuxian surged in power, radiating overwhelming divine might.

Luo Tian’s cultivation was instantly drained. He raised his sword and slashed downward.

“This is!” Seeing the world-destroying aura, Chu Kaihe’s forehead veins bulged. A bad feeling filled his mind.

“Revival of Life!” Chu Kaihe roared, voice full of madness. Facing such a powerful strike, he had clearly given his all.

Sword and blade clashed. The two strong attacks attracted everyone’s attention, even halting the sect masters’ attack on Wanyingkong’s array.

Boom…

The collision sound exploded in everyone’s ears. The storm of destruction struck both Luo Tian and Chu Kaihe.

Boom… Boom…

Both fell to the ground, their bodies weak. They gazed at each other.

“Indeed, Luo Tian! You’ve fought a late-stage Immortal King to this extent!” People gasped. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to survive in such a state.

A crack of a thousand zhang appeared, drawing the violent storm into the sky.

“Kid, when I recover, I’ll kill you!” Chu Kaihe sat cross-legged. That strike had wounded him severely; he lacked the strength to stand.

“Then see who recovers faster!” Luo Tian smiled, sitting cross-legged. Yet he cast divine laws onto his body.

“Open!” As Luo Tian and Chu Kaihe recovered, the second batch of Tianyuan Sect disciples finally transported away. The third batch began rushing toward the array.

“You all, stop attacking the array!” Wu Li roared. His face was dark with anger. However, Meng Wushuang and Lu Chong were not late-stage Immortal Kings but veteran masters. He could not defeat them in a short time.

Chapter 2580: Final Batch

“Everyone, put in more effort and break this array!” Hearing Wu Li’s roar, the sect masters fought harder. Yet they still could not break Wanyingkong and others’ combined array.

“Useless!” Wu Li cursed. He watched Meng Wushuang with a fire sword and Lu Chong with a massive hammer charging at him. Wu Li raised his fist and palm, striking them.

Boom… Boom…

One fist collided with Lu Chong’s hammer. One palm struck the red sword, sending both back.

“Damn!” Wu Li did not feel joy. The two had flown a hundred zhang before returning, preventing him from focusing on others.

“Chu Kaihe, are you not yet recovered?” Wu Li roared. He hoped Chu Kaihe would finish off Luo Tian, then help the sect masters break the array.

But as Wu Li’s gaze fell on Chu Kaihe, his face changed drastically.

“Don’t attack the array. First, kill Luo Tian!” Wu Li shouted loudly. His voice thundered, making the sect masters confused.

Everyone’s gaze turned toward Luo Tian. At this moment, Luo Tian stood up, his hands constantly casting divine chains onto himself.

An immense pressure radiated from him. The sect masters trembled in their minds.

“Why are you still staring? Kill him quickly!” Wu Li roared, making the dazed sect masters snap back to reality.

“What’s happening? How has he become stronger again!” They felt shocked. They sensed Luo Tian’s aura rising rapidly, as if about to break through limits.

“This is!” Chu Kaihe trembled. He saw Luo Tian’s aura becoming increasingly terrifying, the familiar aura reminding him of Luo Tian’s final attack at Yongsheng Mountain.

Heaven… Demon… Liberation… Body…

Cold words echoed from Luo Tian’s mouth. The final divine chain struck, and Luo Tian’s aura stabilized at the late-stage Immortal King level.

A terrifying wave made everyone tremble. They stopped their advance, not daring to move forward.
