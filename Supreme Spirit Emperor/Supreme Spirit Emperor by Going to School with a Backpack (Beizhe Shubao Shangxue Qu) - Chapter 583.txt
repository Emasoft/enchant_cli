“Give you a chance to atone for your sins. Leave these people for me!” The Rakshasa commander did not see Ye Chen in the crowd, and even if he had, he would not have recognized him.

“This….” The Demon Lord’s eyes showed hesitation. If they truly clashed, his people might be wiped out—this was his life’s work.

“Rest easy. If we exterminate them, the Lord of the Dead will surely grant you a title of nobility. You’ll become a commander in the Gate of Heaven!” The Rakshasa sneered, his eyes flashing annoyance.

“Good!” Hearing the Rakshasa’s promise, the Demon Lord’s gaze turned fierce. At this point, there was no choice for him; if he refused, the Rakshasa would surely hold a grudge.

“Men! This is our moment to rise! Kill!” The Demon Lord roared, addressing his subordinates.

“Follow me! Kill!” In an instant, the Demon Lord brandished a black three-pronged spear and charged toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Damn it, do they think they can take us down?” Tian Fu bellowed, swinging his crescent moon axe toward the Demon Lord.

“Even a Semi-Immortal King? Just fight! I’ve faced tougher challenges in my years!” Other commanders also bellowed.

“Kill!” Tens of thousands of disciples from Buxian City roared, their killing intent surging. Ten thousand people became a flood, rushing toward the Demon Clan.

“Everyone, deal with that Rakshasa. I’ll take the Demon Lord!” Luo Tian addressed the eight commanders, his golden chariot transforming into a streak of light toward the Demon Lord.

Only the eight commanders could withstand the Rakshasa; at present, Luo Tian was still weak before a Semi-Immortal King.

“Good!” The eight nodded. They knew Luo Tian’s strength, though his legs were broken, his power was still formidable.

“Buzz…” The Cracking Heaven Spear materialized in Luo Tian’s hand. He dared not use Longyuan, fearing the Rakshasa would recognize him. If he was identified as a disciple of the Wheel Turning Sect, there would be no place for him in the Immortal World. A disciple of the Wheel Turning Sect serving as a commander in Buxian City would be annihilated to dust.

“Buzz…” The Cracking Heaven Spear radiated light, filling Luo Tian’s mind with frustration, yet he smiled.

But Luo Tian had no time to ponder; the Demon Lord was already upon him, three cold glints piercing toward him.

Luo Tian raised his spear to block the Demon Lord’s attack, but both he and his chariot were thrown backward.

The Demon Lord was a peak Immortal, while Luo Tian was an advanced Immortal. Plus, his legs were unresponsive, greatly reducing his strength.

“Buzz…” Black energy surged as Ji Chen appeared like a ghost behind the Demon Lord, two daggers thrusting toward him.

At the same time, Lei Yong moved swiftly, his body crackling with lightning as he slashed downward with a thunder sword. The Demon Lord’s face darkened; Lei Yong and Ji Chen coordinated seamlessly, both at advanced Immortal level but nearing peak. With their cooperation, they were confident in defeating a peak Immortal.

Yet the Demon Lord was no pushover. As a regional powerhouse, his strength surpassed ordinary peak Immortals.

Black wings unfurled, expanding to envelop the Demon Lord’s back. His spear was raised above his head, meeting Lei Yong’s thunder sword.

“Crack…” At the same moment, the thunder sword collided with the spear. Ji Chen’s daggers also pierced the seemingly thin wings. Sparks flew, lightning surged through the Demon Lord’s body, and Ji Chen gaped at the scratches on the wings.

“Whoosh…” A whooshing sound echoed as the black wings, seemingly unaffected by the attack, flapped to emit cold light, slicing through space toward Ji Chen.

The Demon Lord’s body crackled with lightning; he broke free, growling. He swung his spear at Lei Yong, who was thrown backward, blood spilling from his mouth as he stared with grim determination.

“Buzz…” Golden spear shadows descended from the sky, the golden spear body expanding to pierce the Demon Lord’s head.

“Damn it! I don’t believe three of us can’t kill you!” Lei Yong cursed, brandishing his thunder sword to charge again.

Ji Chen’s figure also appeared simultaneously, his robes marked by a scratch. He vanished into the dark sky.

“Haha! Want to kill us for glory? Killing a commander is no small feat!” Tian Fu laughed, swinging his crescent moon axe toward the Rakshasa. The other seven also surged forward to attack the Rakshasa.

The Rakshasa was indeed a Semi-Immortal King. Four arms wielded four different weapons, clashing with the eight commanders. The thunderous impact shook the heavens, splitting the black sky. The battlefield turned into void; anyone daring to cross would be annihilated.

As the high-ranking figures clashed, Buxian City and the Demon Clan’s forces engaged in battle. The battlefield was a full-scale war; Buxian City overwhelmed the enemy, though the Rakshasa’s accompanying advanced Immortals were strong. Buxian City’s forces were no pushovers, with many advanced Immortals.

Cries of agony echoed as Buxian City’s soldiers pushed against the Demon Clan. Within moments, the Demon Clan suffered heavy losses.

“Damn it…” The Demon Lord’s face darkened. Though he fought against Luo Tian and the others without falling behind, he could not overcome them.

“These three are too strong! A normal advanced Immortal would have been wiped out already. But these three withstand my attacks!” The Demon Lord marveled, confident that three advanced Immortals could be easily eliminated. Yet from the start of combat, Luo Tian’s group never fell behind; their experience was exceptional, and their coordination seamless. Attacks flowed like water, relentless and tight, giving him no chance to breathe.

Seeing the Demon Clan’s forces being slaughtered, the Demon Lord felt pain. These were his years of effort.

“Damn it! I must finish these three quickly, then help the Rakshasa eliminate those eight commanders. Then the battle will be decided!” The Demon Lord’s face twisted with madness, watching the Rakshasa’s fight.

Though the eight commanders were strong, they still struggled against the Rakshasa. Once those eight were eliminated, allowing the Rakshasa and himself to focus, annihilating these tens of thousands would be a matter of time.

“Come on!” The Demon Lord roared, his body radiating澎湃 black energy. It transformed into a stream of black runes, sweeping outward.

“Ten… one hundred…” One hundred rune dragons swept in all directions, but their target was not Luo Tian’s group. It was the entire Demon Clan.

The humming echoed as one hundred rune dragons merged into the mountains and earth. A surge of ghostly energy erupted from the Demon Clan’s peaks, coalescing into a tangible form.

“Crack…” At the same time, the Demon Lord’s aura surged wildly. In an instant, it reached Semi-Immortal King level.

“Roar…” A series of thick dragons materialized over the Demon Clan, as if drawn forth by the Demon Lord. Each dragon radiated immense pressure, like living beings.

“Sweep!” The Demon Lord bellowed, his body growing. He seized a dragon and swung it toward Luo Tian and the others.

Chapter 2215: Earth Pulse

The black dragons swept, a hundred in total. As they flew out, the Demon Clan seemed to lose something, no longer as dangerous.

“Buzz…” A powerful pressure radiated from the hundred dragons. Each dragon cracked through space, rushing toward Luo Tian’s group.

A sense of crisis swept over Luo Tian, Lei Yong, and Ji Chen. They felt the dragons’ might; a single hit would mean death or injury.

Yet, the Demon Lord was now a Semi-Immortal King. His speed and power had greatly improved, though achieved through special means. Though his strength was not as formidable as the Rakshasa’s, it still posed a significant threat to Luo Tian’s group.

Three dragons arrived instantly before them. Their faces changed, and they vanished from the spot.

Their speed was not slow; especially Lei Yong and Ji Chen, who excelled in speed. Though Luo Tian’s legs were broken, his speed had not slowed much.

Luo Tian’s group evaded the dragons like fish slipping through nets. A hundred dragons swept the sky, leaving no grass in their path. Many Buxian City disciples were struck by dragons, turning into blood mist without exception.

“This is the earth pulse. The Demon Clan’s underbelly must have one! No wonder the Demon Lord has such power!” The Rakshasa slashed a sword, repelling another. He watched the dragons circling above the Demon Lord, sighing inwardly.

All things have spirit. The earth pulse is the spirit of the land. Formed with difficulty, only through accumulation can it emerge. Where there is an earth pulse, the land is blessed; mastering it allows one to control the great forces of heaven and earth to crush enemies.

“Yet, this Demon Lord has only grasped a fragment. If he mastered it fully, he would be the master of this Demon Clan and even rival an Immortal King!” The Rakshasa’s eyes showed admiration, guessing the Demon Lord’s identity.

Though Luo Tian was fast, his legs were not his own. His sensitivity was slightly lacking, which led to minor mistakes.

“Roar…” Ten black dragons sealed all of Luo Tian’s escape routes. He continuously maneuvered his golden chariot, weaving between the dragons.

“This won’t work! I’ll still be hit. A hundred is too dense!” Luo Tian muttered, but as he thought, his chariot paused for an instant.

“Be careful!” Lei Yong and Ji Chen shouted, their voices filled with urgency. But the dragons were faster than their words. As soon as they spoke, black dragons struck Luo Tian’s body.

As the voice rose, Luo Tian was thrown backward, spitting blood. His golden chariot was shattered.

Luo Tian’s eyes widened in shock, his body flying as if hit by a mountain. Yet his gaze was shocked because two more dragons were coming.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s face darkened. He quickly moved his hands, a black hand tearing from the void to grasp the two dragons.

“Boom…” Yet the two dragons were formidable, shattering the black ghost hand. They altered their trajectory slightly. Luo Tian seized the gap and escaped.

“Little brother!” Lei Yong and Ji Chen’s faces darkened, watching Luo Tian fall from the sky.

“Think about your own safety first!” The Demon Lord’s face was cold. He was decisive, never regretting his decisions. Once he decided to kill Luo Tian’s group, it was a killing move.

“Roar…” Dozens of dragons rushed toward Lei Yong and Ji Chen. When they reacted, the black dragons were already close, their faces darkening.

“Lightning Blade!” Lei Yong’s face darkened. Five-colored divine lightning erupted from his body, surrounding his sword as he slashed at the nearest dragon.

“Crack…” The sword shattered. Thunder surged through Lei Yong’s palm, and he escaped during the gap.

Ji Chen also transformed into a black line, paying a price to break through the encirclement.

“Boom…” Luo Tian fell onto the ground, his face dark. He watched the black dragon pressing down on him.

“Did I really have to use Longyuan?” Luo Tian muttered, raising his hand. The Bow of Shooting the Sun and the Divine Arrow appeared. He drew the bow, arrows flashing with golden light. This time, the divine light was strong enough to pierce through the black dragon, which shattered into swirling black mist sinking into the ground.

“Good lad! I’ll start with you!” The Demon Lord roared. He knew Luo Tian was the leader of these people; killing him would demoralize Buxian City.

“Buzz…” The dragons pursuing Lei Yong and Ji Chen split into dozens, rushing toward Luo Tian.

“Damn it!” Luo Tian’s face darkened. He sat on the ground, watching the pressing black dragon. He punched forward.

Four times his physical strength erupted, shattering one dragon. But nine remained, their might overwhelming.

Luo Tian formed seals with his hands. A hundred silver needles appeared in his hand, which he flung toward his legs.

“Ah…” Luo Tian let out a scream. Most of the needles missed, but three hit their mark. For Luo Tian, it was enough.

His legs gradually regained sensation. He stood up instantly. Nine dragons also rushed toward him, each capable of wounding Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s legs emitted waves. He vanished from the spot but still faced three dragons.

“Boom… Boom…” Yet when Luo Tian planned to fight with his body, two massive meteorites crashed from the sky. The black dragons were large, but the two meteors were no smaller. They pressed down on three black dragons.

The thunderous sound shook the nine heavens, and the three dragons shattered into terrifying waves sweeping into void fissures.

“Brother, you can’t let me take all the glory!” Ye Liangchen smiled, though he was battered and panting. His body radiated powerful energy, his gaze on Luo Tian.

“Thank you!” Ye Chen looked at Luo Tian, his eyes filled with complex emotions. At this moment, he had suspicions but didn’t want to believe what he suspected.

“Even if there are more, what’s the difference?” As their words finished, the Demon Lord’s cold voice echoed again. With over ninety dragons left, they rushed toward Luo Tian and the others this time, now with Ye Chen and Ye Liangchen joining.

“Not good. If we continue like this, casualties will happen!” Luo Tian gritted his teeth. He planned to use Longyuan, gaining at least a chance.

“Buzz…” As Luo Tian prepared to use Longyuan, cold air surged. Ice power spread instantly, and the entire world began to snowflakes. Upon closer inspection, these were miniature lotus flowers.

Freezing three thousand miles, the entire world seemed frozen. Time and space were locked.

“Crack…” The肆虐 black dragons instantly stopped chasing Luo Tian’s group, frozen in place and falling from the sky.

“Crack… Crack…” Each black dragon shattered on the frozen ground, turning into fragments scattered across the earth.

“Is my presence useful?”

“Your older brother isn’t someone you can bully!” A white sword materialized as a streak of light, piercing the Demon Lord. The sword seemed slow, like an ice blade, but in the next moment it was at the Demon Lord’s side, thrusting toward him.

“Buzz…” The Demon Lord’s face darkened. His black wings enveloped his body, and he raised his spear to block the ice sword.

“Crack…” A crisp sound rose before the Demon Lord. The ice sword shattered, and the Demon Lord’s body suddenly retreated. Shattered ice crystals struck his wing-covered body, producing a series of sounds. Blood flowed down the Demon Lord’s body.

“What else do you have?” The Demon Lord roared, but his heart trembled. He formed seals with his hands and slammed them onto the ground. Black mist surged again.

A figure appeared in people’s sight, wearing a white robe with a touch of aging. His eyes were deep, and he took one step toward Luo Tian.

“Senior Brother!” Luo Tian recognized the figure instantly, his voice filled with excitement and joy.

“Is he Bloodface?” Tian Fu and others gazed in shock. They hadn’t expected Bloodface to be so young.

“His hair isn’t white anymore. It seems his issue is resolved, and he’s entered the Semi-Immortal King!” The commanders muttered, their eyes filled with admiration.

In the snowy and icy world, Zhang Ziping radiated a killing intent. His eyes were colder than the wind.

“Die!” Zhang Ziping slowly helped Luo Tian up, then pointed his finger at the Demon Lord.

A single finger drop caused the world to roar. Ice swords formed rapidly, becoming an ice sword dragon rushing toward the Demon Lord.

The bone-chilling wind made the Demon Lord shiver. Seeing the overwhelming power of each ice sword, he felt fear. Especially with thousands of them.

“Demon Magic!” The Demon Lord knew he couldn’t escape, so he chose to fight. He fought with all his might.

Chapter 2216: The Demon Lord’s Identity

The Demon Lord’s face was wild. At this point, he wouldn’t give up easily. Moreover, it was in the Demon Clan’s territory, giving him confidence to fight a Semi-Immortal King.

No choice but to fight. If he didn’t, the ice sword dragon would kill him.

The Demon Lord had intended to draw more earth pulse power for battle, but found the frozen ground prevented black energy from emerging. He had to find another way.

Waves radiated from the Demon Lord’s body, humming as space twisted. The waves affected the ice sword dragon rushing toward him. Space whirlwinds formed instantly, enveloping the dragon. No waves stirred; the dragon was swallowed by the whirlwind and vanished from sight.

“Crash… Crash…” Far away on the battlefield, it seemed to snow swords. Ice swords appeared and fell onto the Demon Clan, destroying many peaks before settling.

“Spatial Manipulation Technique?” Seeing the Demon Lord’s skill, people were slightly shocked. The ice swords Zhang Ziping had launched were powerful enough to make even an Immortal King cautious.

“This Demon Lord has some skills. If he ascends to Semi-Immortal King, it would be quite troublesome!” Zhang Ziping smiled, his white sword in hand.

“Rest well. Let your senior brother kill him!” Zhang Ziping addressed Luo Tian and Lei Yong, his voice filled with confidence. He flew toward the Demon Lord.

“Press down!” The Demon Lord formed seals, invisible waves radiating from his hands. As the waves spread, the world changed color. Wind and clouds reversed, a phantom figure appearing in the sky.

The mountains and earth trembled. A powerful aura radiated from the Demon Lord’s body, an invisible force that pressed down on Zhang Ziping.

“This….” Luo Tian and others were stunned, watching the figure standing in the world. They felt the immense pressure; if they were pressed down, they would never rise again.

It was a world force, comparable to an Immortal King’s domain. Accurately speaking, an Immortal King’s domain was also a force, formed by one's own aura at its peak. It gained the world’s approval.

However, the Demon Lord only used a part of it, not all. This was an ability he had since birth. As time passed, the Demon Lord could master more world forces.

Zhang Ziping’s face remained calm. His speed slightly slowed, but he still moved toward the Demon Lord. Each step he took caused a lotus of ice crystals to rise beneath his feet.

His head was crowned with swirling cold mist. His robes flapped in the wind, clearly showing the invisible pressure never ceased but could not suppress Zhang Ziping.

“Damn it… This is my limit of world forces!” The Demon Lord watched Zhang Ziping approaching, each step bringing him closer to death.

“Boom… Boom…” The phantom figure in the sky gradually solidified. Its crimson eyes were clearly a larger version of the Demon Lord, though with slight differences in appearance.

“Buzz…” A space whirlwind reappeared. The Demon Lord tried to suck Zhang Ziping into the void, to be crushed by it.

“Frost Winter!” Zhang Ziping coldly spoke. A furious storm swept out, snow and wind covering the sky. The icy temperature instantly collided with the twisted space whirlwind.

“Crack…” The twisted space whirlwind stopped abruptly above Zhang Ziping, as if frozen into an ice sculpture. It looked very beautiful.

“Indeed, it froze space!” People were shocked, eyes filled with disbelief. They watched Zhang Ziping approaching the Demon Lord.

“He just entered the Semi-Immortal King, yet has such strength! Such power is top-tier among Semi-Immortal Kings!” The Rakshasa’s eyebrows slightly furrowed, slicing through a commander. His heart was also serious.

As Zhang Ziping approached the Demon Lord, a furious snowstorm swept over him. The Demon Lord tried to escape but was slowed by the icy power, having no chance.

“Buzz…” A white sword light rose. The icy force instantly froze the Demon Lord, his eyes still filled with terror.

“Frost Shatter!” A soft voice echoed. The ice sword fell, slicing the frozen Demon Lord’s body. Ice crystals appeared in Luo Tian’s group’s sight. The Demon Lord instantly turned into fragments, scattering onto the ground.

“Brave!” Ye Liangchen watched Zhang Ziping holding the sword, his eyes filled with reverence. Zhang Ziping’s words still echoed in his ears.

“Boom…” At the moment the Demon Lord shattered, the phantom figure above also collapsed with a thunderous sound. The immense pressure vanished from Luo Tian’s group’s perception.

“Senior Brother, you’ve become more like the Master. I’m starting to doubt if you’re his real son…” Lei Yong spoke softly.

“Rubbish…” Ji Chen couldn’t help but curse, feeling Lei Yong was questioning Zhang Daotian’s character.

Luo Tian also had no words for this impulsive senior.

“Who is the Master of such four disciples?” Ye Liangchen wondered. Four disciples so outstanding, their master must be an unparalleled strength.

“Not dead!” However, Zhang Ziping still stood in place. His brows furrowed. The ice crystals of the Demon Lord were beginning to heal slowly. More earth pulse energy surged from the frozen mass, gathering together and condensing into the ice crystals. Black mist swept in, and the Demon Lord’s figure appeared before people, causing their faces to be shocked.

Not only Luo Tian and Ye Chen but even the Demon Lord himself was bewildered, not knowing how he had revived.

“He is a ghost born from the earth pulse. You can’t kill him. Even if destroyed, he will revive soon as long as the earth pulse exists!” The Rakshasa laughed, his four arms moving. He directly repelled the eight commanders.

Puk-puk-puk… The eight mouths spat blood, their eyes showing weakness. Yet the Rakshasa’s body transformed into a black lightning bolt, appearing beside the Demon Lord. He grabbed the bewildered Demon Lord and flew away.

“Want to run?” Zhang Ziping’s brows slightly furrowed. He swung his sword, and a dragon of swords rushed toward the Rakshasa.

“I if want to leave, no one can stop me!” The Rakshasa sneered. One hand held a sword and slashed it, colliding with the sword dragon.

The shockwave swept. The Rakshasa’s body was thrown back, and the sword dragon shattered. The impact struck the Rakshasa’s body. Though he was a Semi-Immortal King and had been famous for years, being like Ko Duanshan, the commander, Zhang Ziping was strong but it was difficult to hold back the Rakshasa.

The Rakshasa’s body flickered, vanishing from Luo Tian’s group’s sight. They all sighed in relief.

“Congratulations, Bloodface! You’ve become a Semi-Immortal King!” Tian Fu and Chen Long’s eyes showed admiration. They wiped blood from their mouths, approaching Zhang Ziping to congratulate him.

On the other side, the battlefield had concluded. Seven or eight thousand people were wiped out by Buxian City’s disciples, leaving only over a thousand who surrendered. After all, the Demon Lord and Rakshasa had escaped; there was no need to fight to death.

“Mission accomplished. Let’s return!” Luo Tian sat back in his chariot, a smile on his face—though it was now silver instead of golden.

“Thank you all. Rest assured, when we return to Buxian City, I’ll refine the Ghost-Repelling Pills for you. As for the rewards of the eight commanders, I’ll handle them after refining the pills!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing everyone.

“Thank you, Master Luo!” People’s faces lit up. Though Buxian City had some losses, they were not major.

“Don’t rush off. It’s been a long time since we came here. I heard there are many opportunities in the Demon Clan. Let’s check!” Zhang Ziping smiled, gazing at the Demon Clan beneath them, sensing a faint danger.

Yet danger often accompanied opportunity. Zhang Ziping was now a Semi-Immortal King, having gained some confidence to protect Luo Tian and others.

“Opportunities?” Hearing Zhang Ziping’s words, the eight commanders’ eyes lit up. Like wolves seeing food, they were almost drooling.

“Luo Tian’s eyes also brightened slightly. His current strength was good, but the battle with the Demon Lord had shown his shortcomings. Facing a Semi-Immortal King, he had no chance to win without using Longyuan. Even this semi-professional Demon Lord was not a match.

“Once your legs recover, we’ll go!” Zhang Ziping smiled and flew toward the mountain where the Demon Lord resided.

However, Zhang Ziping’s intention was good. As soon as he started moving, a series of booming sounds echoed from the Demon Clan.

Zhang Ziping hadn’t even reached the mountain when it collapsed, turning into dust and swirling up.

Boom… Boom…

Like the end of the world, the entire vast Demon Clan began to collapse in large pieces. Black smoke instantly engulfed the entire world.

Chapter 2217: The Way of Heaven and Humanity

Smoke surged, the entire world plunged into darkness. Luo Tian’s group was engulfed, as if they had vanished entirely.

Black smoke choked Luo Tian, making him cough constantly. His body felt dazed and couldn’t see around; the view was gray, his body pressed down by world forces he couldn’t resist.

“Boom…” After who knew how long, Luo Tian finally sat on the ground. His chariot, given by Lei Yong, was shattered again.

“Damn it…” Luo Tian cursed under his breath, shaking off the dust. He coughed again, looking around.

Still dark, but not like before with swirling dust. Luo Tian’s eyes flashed purple as he looked at the surroundings, resembling a cave. He was relieved that this cave had relatively rich ghost and immortal energy.

Luo Tian couldn’t do anything. His legs weren’t healed yet; it would take a day normally, but using the golden needles had allowed him to stand briefly. However, it worsened his condition, needing four or five days for full recovery.

“Ah… I hope nothing dangerous happens!” Luo Tian sighed longingly, looking around the cave. He would recover first and then check the surroundings.

Previously, he had rushed here to save Ye Liangchen. Now, his life was more important.

From his years of experience, Luo Tian knew the Demon Clan had changed. Things out of the ordinary always had a reason—perhaps the Demon Lord’s departure caused changes, or the war disturbed its restrictions.

But since this place could form an earth pulse, a rare thing, Luo Tian knew it was no ordinary place.

“Maybe there really is something that can greatly increase one’s strength!” Luo Tian sighed, but what was the use? He couldn’t go looking for it.

“Come on… I’ve been waiting for you!” As Luo Tian sighed, a series of calls echoed in the flickering light. It made Luo Tian shiver.

The voice was ethereal, but he was certain he hadn’t misheard. Though the voice wasn’t loud, it made Luo Tian’s skin crawl.

“What is it? Is there someone living under the Demon Clan?” Luo Tian wondered, his mind echoing with that voice without stopping.

“Recover!”

“Only by recovering your strength can you find opportunities!” Luo Tian sighed longingly, sitting on the ground to recover. But that voice never stopped, making him increasingly annoyed.

“Hey kid, I took a nap. Why are you in such a mess?” The voice of Buxian Stone echoed in Luo Tian’s mind, making him pause.

“Nap? Nap your ass! My legs were broken, and you didn’t help at all!” Luo Tian cursed.

“Rubbish…”

“Huh? Interesting!”

“There’s something here at my level. That’s rare!” Buxian Stone’s voice showed surprise.

“What is it?” Luo Tian’s eyes immediately lit up with interest, sighing inwardly that there was definitely something good.

“But it’s still trash in front of me. Scrap metal! I once shattered the sky, creating a rift and轮回…” Buxian Stone didn’t answer Luo Tian’s question but instead boasted.

The more Buxian Stone boasted, the more Luo Tian felt it was nervous. He became increasingly interested.

“Kid, want to take it?” Buxian Stone saw Luo Tian didn’t respond and stopped boasting, addressing him.

“How? I’m in such a state. Just not being taken is good enough!” Luo Tian shook his head gently. The other was at the same level as Buxian Stone, and Luo Tian didn’t want to be tricked.

“I’ll take you there. Once you get there, your legs will be healed!” Buxian Stone addressed Luo Tian.

“Good!” Luo Tian nodded. He felt it was safer there than in this cave.

“Buzz…” Waves enveloped Luo Tian’s body. In an instant, he was on the red earth, feeling safe.

“Go!” Buxian Stone said. Dust began to drift, moving toward the cave’s depths.

Time passed. The dust drifted as Luo Tian sat on the red earth, constantly watching around. Though it was empty, he felt danger.

“Kid, did you feel it?”

“This place may seem harmless but contains a hidden threat. If not careful, you’ll be crushed to death! This is the world force; heaven cannot be resisted!”

“You’re currently with me, so you don’t feel it. If you did, you’d be crushed to death!” Buxian Stone addressed Luo Tian.

“Heaven cannot be resisted?” Luo Tian muttered, recalling Gu Tian. This man who was always invincible had been suppressed by heaven’s will. Luo Tian had always admired this invincible old ancestor.

“Where are those old ancestors, the masters of past eras and kings? With their strength, they couldn’t remain nameless. And I’ve seen the Fire Master; I’m sure the others are also there!” Luo Tian muttered. He had now fully integrated into life in the Immortal World, even entering hell.

But he had never heard of them. This made him puzzled. As for their safety, he truly didn’t worry; those who had reached the peak of nine regions were no pushovers. They would definitely not die.

“Life is long ahead!” Luo Tian sighed, watching the surrounding terrain. His mind constantly calculated and tried to deduce the world forces.
