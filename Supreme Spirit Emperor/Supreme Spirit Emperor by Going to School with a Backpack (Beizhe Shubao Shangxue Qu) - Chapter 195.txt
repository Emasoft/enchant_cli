“This is the omen of a Holy Grade Elixir’s emergence. Could it be that the Tongtian Sect harbors a Holy Grade Alchemist?” The disciples who had probed the situation relayed this news to their sects, though they all added the word 'suspected' to it.

On the third day of Luo Tian’s cultivation retreat, a shocking revelation spread: the current Grand Elder of Tongtian Sect, Song Yongkang, had successfully entered the Transcendent Realm. The revelation left people stunned, and for a time, Tongtian Sect became enigmatic across the Fire Domain. All sects held back, waiting for developments from Tongtian Sect.

That day was the third day of Luo Tian’s retreat. Within Tongtian Sect, golden light flickered, and a beam of golden radiance burst forth. The probing disciples were taken aback, but in the next moment, the light vanished as if it had never existed. The observers felt as though they had been deceived by their own eyes.

“What in the world was that? Was it a martial technique?”

“I don’t know. Let’s not dwell on it. Recently, Tongtian Sect has been acting strange—mysterious and elusive. A single beam of light? Probably nothing to worry about!” The disciples murmured among themselves before returning to their posts, concealing themselves once more.

That beam of light was indeed Luo Tian. He emerged precisely on time, his departure urgent—Luo Tian did not want any misfortune befalling Long Jie. After all, Long Jie’s dragon lineage was so potent it was irresistible. Luo Tian feared for his safety and immediately took him away while he still pondered the ancient celestial script carved into the stone wall.

“Brother, what’s wrong?” Long Jie looked bewildered, unaware of why Luo Tian had hurriedly pulled him out.

“Nothing. Remember—when we arrive, do not reveal any signs of your dragon lineage!” Luo Tian spoke, issuing a few instructions to Long Jie before leading him toward the Sea-and-Mountain Continent.

Two days passed in a blink. Luo Tian and Long Jie’s figures appeared at the edge of the Sea-and-Mountain Continent, where people were already bustling about. Many had come merely to gawk at the spectacle of the Sea-and-Mountain Sect’s Holy Maiden, Du Yuying.

“Two days—just in time. Faster than I expected!” Luo Tian smiled, stepping into the Sea-and-Mountain Continent alongside Long Jie.

There was still a day left. Though time was sufficient, Luo Tian dared not be careless—after all, he still wasn’t certain whether Xu Zhengwen had enrolled his name.

Half a day later, Luo Tian arrived at the gates of the Sea-and-Mountain Sect. His gaze was filled with admiration for the grandeur of the sect.

Before the vast gates of the Sea-and-Mountain Sect, people flowed like a river. Two disciples clad in the sect’s attire—Nine Source Heavenly Immortals—and several Earth-Level Immortals patrolled, scrutinizing those waiting to enter.

The people naturally obeyed the rules, showing no audacity. They respectfully presented their identity jade tokens to the gatekeepers, who verified them before allowing passage.

Luo Tian and Long Jie moved in line while extending their spiritual senses to search for Xu Zhengwen. Yet they found no sign of him—Luo Tian suspected that Xu Zhengwen had entered ahead of them.

Soon it was their turn. When Luo Tian and Long Jie presented the Tongtian Sect’s identity token, the gatekeeper—another Nine Source Heavenly Immortal—showed surprise.

“From Tongtian Sect?” The gatekeeper asked, astonished. He hadn’t expected to see disciples from the recently ascendant Tongtian Sect at this time.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian nodded slightly, gazing at the gatekeeper. After all, this was the Sea-and-Mountain Sect, one of the Three Great Sects—no need for conflict.

“Tongtian Sect recently had something happen, right? Are you the young man who killed Ma Tongtian?” The gatekeeper’s eyes were filled with curiosity, scrutinizing Luo Tian.

As the gatekeeper spoke, all those around him turned their gazes toward Luo Tian. After all, that young man who had slain Ma Tongtian was now the talk of the Fire Domain, surpassing even the Holy Sons and Daughters of the Three Great Sects.

“No. I am merely a humble disciple of Tongtian Sect,” Luo Tian smiled, answering the gatekeeper. “Our sect encountered some upheaval, so we were sent here to support the Sea-and-Mountain Sect.”

“Enter,” the gatekeeper said, his expression oddly mixed. He allowed Luo Tian and Long Jie to pass. Among the crowd, some cast pitying glances toward them.

Feeling the gatekeeper’s strange gaze, Luo Tian and Long Jie furrowed their brows slightly but ultimately stepped into the Sea-and-Mountain Sect.

“Unexpectedly, Tongtian Sect’s people dare to come. Don’t they know Ma Tongtian’s relationship with our Supreme Elder Ma Feiyang? I think these two young men are doomed!”

“Hmph. Perhaps they’re just pawns sent by Tongtian Sect to bear the wrath of the Sea-and-Mountain Sect!” Muttered voices, though quiet, did not escape Luo Tian’s ears. His eyes darkened further.

Chapter 886: The Location of the Epoch Book

On the vast plaza of the Sea-and-Mountain Sect, teeming with millions, disciples from the sect and other factions stood beneath a high platform. Their gazes carried reverence toward the three elders atop it.

Besides the Sea-and-Mountain Sect’s native forces, the heads of the other two great sects had also come to support the Sea-and-Mountain Sect.

Luo Tian and Long Jie followed the crowd’s gaze upward, their expressions solemn. Each of the three elders radiated an unfathomable aura—Luo Tian knew they were all at the Holy Realm’s initial stage.

Luo Tian hadn’t expected the heads of the Fire Domain to be at this level. This stirred a sense of crisis within him, yet he felt confident—his full arsenal could match even a Holy Realm initial-stage powerhouse. Especially with the加持 of Gu Tianshu’s Brahman Attack, he felt invincible.

“Is that Jin Chan Sect’s headmaster, Jin Jingtian? And Lu Hantu of the Flame-Embracing Temple?”

“Hmph. You don’t know much, do you? Every Holy Son of Jin Chan Sect and Flame-Embracing Temple wants to marry Du Yuying. Marrying her would mean allying with the Sea-and-Mountain Sect—two sects won’t miss this chance!” The crowd murmured, their gazes filled with reverence toward the three elders at the top of the Fire Domain.

“Is that the Sea-and-Mountain Sect’s Grandmaster, Du Hongtao?” Luo Tian listened to the cacophony of murmurs and turned his gaze toward the elderly man seated at the front, whose face was kind. He whispered to himself.

At the same time, Luo Tian’s spiritual senses spread outward, searching for Xu Zhengwen and also testing whether he could find the reincarnated Chen Yunting.

After a quarter of an hour, as expected, he found no trace of Chen Yunting in the sea of people. However, he did spot Xu Zhengwen among the crowd, constantly looking around.

At that moment, Xu Zhengwen stood with several others. Evidently, he was also a disciple of a minor sect. The lead elder among them only reached the Nine Source level.

“Xu Zhengwen, what are you looking for?” The lead elder’s face bore impatience as he lightly scolded.

“Hmph. Xu Zhengwen, don’t you know where you are? If you keep gazing around like this, you’ll bring trouble to the sect!” A youth with a flirtatious demeanor glared at Xu Zhengwen, his eyes filled with provocation.

“I’m just looking for a friend. I won’t bring trouble to the sect!” Xu Zhengwen’s voice carried restraint, ignoring the youth and gazing at the headmaster of the Cloud-Dispersing Sect.

Luo Tian moved through the crowd with Long Jie, his senses fixed on Xu Zhengwen’s side. Upon hearing Xu Zhengwen’s words, Luo Tian furrowed his brows slightly.

“Cloud-Dispersing Sect?” Luo Tian recalled the description of the Cloud-Dispersing Sect and finally remembered.

The Cloud-Dispersing Sect was one of Tongtian Sect’s subordinate sects. Within the entire Cloud-Dispersing Sect, only two Nine Source Heavenly Immortals existed. Though their strength wasn’t the weakest in the Fire Domain, it was still unremarkable—middle-tier and inconspicuous.

“Kid, how dare you speak to the headmaster like that? Don’t you know respect?” The youth who had previously scolded Xu Zhengwen clearly clashed with him, rebuking again.

“Ding Pengzu, get lost…” Xu Zhengwen was annoyed. Seeing the youth overstep, he felt impatient and cast a cold glance at Ding Pengzu.

Ding Pengzu shivered instinctively but quickly recovered, attempting to retaliate. However, Xu Zhengwen cut him off.

“Luo Tian!” Xu Zhengwen spotted Luo Tian approaching and smiled, waving to him.

“Xu Xiong, sorry I’m late!” Luo Tian smiled as he arrived before Xu Zhengwen. He ignored the sect members beside Xu Zhengwen, for he had clearly heard their hostility toward Xu Zhengwen.

“Luo Xiong, sorry I couldn’t get you enrolled. Our sect only has one spot,” Xu Zhengwen said with regret.

“No problem!” Luo Tian smiled dismissively. He had anticipated this situation—how could the Sea-and-Mountain Sect’s Holy Maiden marry a disciple of a minor sect? It would be a joke.

“Hmph. Indeed, fish seek fish, shrimp seek shrimp, and turtles find their kind! How dare you attend the marriage trial? You don’t even know your own status!” Ding Pengzu sneered, not recognizing Luo Tian’s cultivation level. He only saw Long Jie, who had ascended to the Eight Source Heavenly Immortal, and mocked him.

Luo Tian’s expression darkened but he said nothing. He didn’t want to make Xu Zhengwen uncomfortable in his sect.

“Come on, Luo Tian. Let me introduce you—this is our Cloud-Dispersing Sect’s headmaster, Xie Zizhen. He’s at the Nine Source level!” Xu Zhengwen led Luo Tian before the elder, his face filled with respect as he introduced them.

“Hmph,” Xie Zizhen gave a slight nod. His gaze swept over Luo Tian before his expression shifted. Upon recalling that Luo Tian was Xu Zhengwen’s friend, he gave another slight nod and said nothing more, clearly uninterested in speaking with Luo Tian.

Luo Tian didn’t dwell on it. He turned to Long Jie and said, “Go report my name. Don’t delay the main event!”

“Ah…” Long Jie clearly disliked Xie Zizhen and Ding Pengzu. He hurriedly walked toward the registration area.

“Hmph, really going to register? Xu Zhengwen, didn’t you tell your rustic friend that without proper status, one can’t attend the marriage trial?” Ding Pengzu sneered, looking at Luo Tian with disdain.

“Ding Pengzu, I’ve already given you the spot. Don’t push too far. This is my friend. You’ve insulted both me and him—please apologize to my friend!” Xu Zhengwen had reached his limit. His gaze turned hostile toward Ding Pengzu.

“Apologize? My dictionary doesn’t have the word ‘apology’!” Ding Pengzu spoke loudly, drawing everyone’s attention.

“Hmph. Who dares to make noise in my Sea-and-Mountain Sect?” A disciple clad in the sect’s attire emerged from the crowd, his face cold. He gazed at Ding Pengzu.

Luo Tian saw this disciple and smiled—what a coincidence. This was the same Nine Source youth who had checked his identity token at the gate.

At that moment, the Sea-and-Mountain Sect’s gates had closed. Evidently, this youth had finished checking identities and returned to the sect. He was passing by when he noticed what was happening. Today was the marriage trial of their Holy Maiden, and it must not be compromised.

“Sorry, Senior Brother. I was reprimanding my junior brother. Sorry! I’ll be careful!” Ding Pengzu smiled nervously, addressing the Nine Source disciple of the Sea-and-Mountain Sect. His voice was as humble as a servant.

“Hmph…” The crowd saw Ding Pengzu’s demeanor and sneered. They recalled how Ding Pengzu had boasted earlier that he didn’t know the word ‘apology’—now, this man had turned his back on his words faster than flipping a page.

Seeing the crowd’s mocking glances, Ding Pengzu showed no shame. After all, this man was a disciple of the Sea-and-Mountain Sect—Nine Source level, comparable to their headmaster. In fact, his status was even more prestigious than their headmaster.

Not only Ding Pengzu but also Xie Zizhen of the Cloud-Dispersing Sect was no longer aloof. His expression changed, and he approached the Nine Source disciple of the Sea-and-Mountain Sect, bowing slightly: “My apologies. I failed to discipline my disciples.”

“Xu Zhengwen, bring your friend and apologize to the Sea-and-Mountain Sect’s senior disciple!” Xie Zizhen said after his apology, his expression turned cold as he scolded Xu Zhengwen. He was two-faced—before and after.

“I…,” Xu Zhengwen looked helpless, gazing at Luo Tian with a troubled expression. He knew Luo Tian was strong, but if they offended the Sea-and-Mountain Sect, even a single disciple of theirs would be beyond what the Cloud-Dispersing Sect could withstand.

Luo Tian clearly saw Xu Zhengwen’s dilemma. He smiled and led Xu Zhengwen before the Sea-and-Mountain Sect disciple, giving a slight bow: “What a coincidence—we’ve met again!”

The Sea-and-Mountain Sect disciple’s gaze remained on Luo Tian, knowing he was no ordinary person. He didn’t dwell on whether Luo Tian had apologized.

“Tongtian Sect!” Upon hearing the Nine Source disciple’s words, people showed surprise. They gazed at Luo Tian, not expecting this youth to be from the recently renowned Tongtian Sect.

“Tong… Tongtian Sect…” Xu Zhengwen looked stunned, gazing at Luo Tian. He hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be from Tongtian Sect.

Xie Zizhen and Ding Pengzu were also stunned. After all, the Cloud-Dispersing Sect was a subordinate of Tongtian Sect—Tongtian Sect was their superior.

“Master of the Golden Sand Gang, Master of the Thunderbolt Academy…” A series of loud calls filled the crowd, each carrying reverence. Evidently, they were all subordinate sects of Tongtian Sect.

Stunned, Xie Zizhen was stunned. Ding Pengzu was stunned. Even Xu Zhengwen looked stunned, gazing at Luo Tian without knowing what to say.

“Luo Xiong, you’re from Tongtian Sect? I heard they had some trouble. Has Tongtian Sect been affected…” Xu Zhengwen wanted to ask Luo Tian about the current state of Tongtian Sect, but then he recalled a more terrifying thought—the day he parted from Luo Tian, only two or three days had passed before the news of Tongtian Sect’s headmaster being killed spread. He remembered Luo Tian’s terrifying gaze and the chilling aura of killing.

“Did you kill Ma Tongtian?” Xu Zhengwen couldn’t continue thinking. He gazed at Luo Tian, who wore a smile, and could hardly believe that the headmaster of Tongtian Sect—Ma Tongtian, a Transcendent Realm powerhouse—had been defeated by this seemingly harmless youth.

Luo Tian nodded at Xu Zhengwen, smiling: “Hmph. Sorry, Zhengwen Xiong, I kept my identity a secret.”

“No… no problem!” Xu Zhengwen was dazed, unsure how to address Luo Tian now.

“Um… Luo…” Ding Pengzu truly wanted to slap himself. What had he done? He had called a disciple of Tongtian Sect ‘a rustic’ and mocked him repeatedly.

“Shut up!” Xie Zizhen clearly disapproved of Ding Pengzu. If it weren’t for Ding Pengzu being the headmaster’s disciple, Xie Zizhen would have slapped him across the face. This Ding Pengzu had now offended two people he shouldn’t have.

“Alright, go back and tell your headmaster that we at Tongtian Sect look highly upon Xu Zhengwen. We hope he becomes the next headmaster of Cloud-Dispersing Sect. In other words, we only recognize Xu Zhengwen as the headmaster. Got it?” Luo Tian spoke calmly, his tone leaving no room for doubt.

“This… yes! I’ll definitely pass on the message!” Xie Zizhen hesitated but saw Luo Tian’s expression darken slightly. He quickly replied.

“Xu Senior, we were wrong before. Please don’t take it to heart!” The disciples of the Cloud-Dispersing Sect, who had previously been cold toward Xu Zhengwen, now seemed to have changed. They sent him signals of goodwill.

“No problem, Luo Tian. Thank you,” Xu Zhengwen said with gratitude toward Luo Tian.

“Let’s leave it at that, Xu Xiong. If you have any trouble, just say my name Luo Tian at Tongtian Sect,” Luo Tian patted Xu Zhengwen’s shoulder and no longer paid attention to the stunned Xu Zhengwen.

“Kid, don’t blame me for not warning you. Killing Ma Tongtian will bring trouble your way. Be careful,” the Nine Source Heavenly Immortal of the Sea-and-Mountain Sect passed Luo Tian and whispered a warning.

“Hmph?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, scanning the crowd atop the platform. He wasn’t foolish—this warning came from this youth, so there was an 80% chance that those wanting his life were among the Sea-and-Mountain Sect.

At that moment, the platform was filled with influential figures from the Three Great Sects. Three Holy Realm initial-stage elders stood there, as if they could suppress everything.

Behind them were several Nine Source powerhouses and young disciples radiating golden light. No doubt, these were the Holy Sons and Daughters of the Three Great Sects.

Luo Tian’s gaze met that of a half-Holy Realm elder from the Sea-and-Mountain Sect. He felt the killer intent in his eyes and instinctively twitched his eyebrows, confirming that this half-Holy Realm elder was the one who wanted to kill him.

“Sea-and-Mountain Sect’s Supreme Elder Ma Feiyang!” Luo Tian recalled the discussions among Sea-and-Mountain Sect disciples when he first entered.

“A half-Holy Realm—now, it’s not a threat to me. The real threat is the Sea-and-Mountain Sect’s headmaster and its resources,” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, calculating how to deal with it.

The most important thing for Luo Tian was the ancient book mentioned by the elder—the remaining pages of the Epoch Book. If it were in the Sea-and-Mountain Sect, he would do anything to obtain it—even steal.

Unfortunately, after searching the area, Luo Tian found no place that seemed to house the Epoch Book. Even his mind’s connection to it showed no reaction.

“Damn, how vast are the Nine Realms? Where in the world will I find those remaining eight pages of the Epoch Book?” Luo Tian cursed inwardly, but his expression remained calm.

“Brother, I’ve registered your name. Tongtian Sect indeed has two spots!” Long Jie appeared before Luo Tian, speaking.

“Dong…” A heavy bell sounded, sending a powerful wave through everyone. The sea of people beneath the platform fell silent instantly.

“Sea-and-Mountain Sect’s Bell, I didn’t expect Du Yuying’s marriage trial to use this Holy Artifact! Truly a major event for the Sea-and-Mountain Sect!” The crowd murmured in awe at the heart-stirring bell.

“This bell’s sound is familiar!” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, feeling like he had heard a similar bell before.

“Yin魂 Bell!” Luo Tian narrowed his eyes, a dangerous glint in his gaze. He finally recalled where he had heard this sound—exactly the Yin魂 Bell, an ancient artifact of the Gu Family.

Though the Yin魂 Bell’s power was far inferior to this Sea-and-Mountain Sect’s Bell, their essence was the same—using spiritual suppression to attack.

“This Sea-and-Mountain Sect’s Bell is likely the one from the Gu Family. The entire Fire Domain was once ruled by the Gu Family, so the Sea-and-Mountain Sect naturally belonged to it. Later, when the Gu Family declined, their belongings were inevitably divided among others!” Luo Tian muttered inwardly. At this moment, he viewed most sects in the Fire Domain as enemies of the Gu Family.

“If one has the strength, reclaiming the Gu Family’s belongings is not impossible!” Luo Tian’s gaze swept over the Three Great Sects’ figures.

As Luo Tian was lost in thought, Du Hongtao, the Sea-and-Mountain Sect’s Grandmaster, smiled and flew into the sky. His voice carried a gentle tone: “Dear disciples of the Fire Domain, today is the day to choose my daughter’s husband. Since Dan cultivation dominates the Fire Domain, I hope to find a Dan master for my daughter! Thus, this marriage trial will test Dan cultivation!”

Du Hongtao’s words did not stir the crowd. After all, everyone knew this marriage trial was likely to test Dan cultivation.

“Simple rules: I’ve prepared a Dan formula for everyone. Each person can refine three batches of elixirs. The one with the best elixir will be my daughter Du Yuying’s future husband. The elixirs will serve as the dowry!” Du Hongtao smiled, explaining the trial’s rules.

The rules were direct. Evidently, a sect like Sea-and-Mountain Sect cared only for the result—how one achieved it was irrelevant, even if it were luck.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows. He had already achieved his goal, though he hadn’t explored a few places. But with some more time, he was certain to scan those areas.

However, Du Hongtao’s next words sparked Luo Tian’s interest and even a hint of excitement.

“Of course, my daughter Du Yuying wouldn’t lack dowry. Whoever is truly destined to marry her will receive this dowry!” Du Hongtao smiled, raising his hand. Instantly, golden light filled the sky, and a blinding glow invaded everyone’s vision.

What thrilled Luo Tian was that the golden object in the sky was none other than the missing page of the Epoch Book he had longed for.

Luo Tian’s heart surged with excitement. He hadn’t expected to find the missing page of the Epoch Book so quickly, and there was even an opportunity to obtain it.

“Seems this marriage trial is unavoidable!” Luo Tian gazed at the golden page of the Epoch Book in the sky, clenching his fist lightly.

“This missing page of the golden book was obtained by me in a remote place. Though I don’t know its use, I do know it’s no ordinary artifact. If one spends time deciphering it, they’ll surely gain a great cultivation boon!” Du Hongtao smiled, addressing the crowd.

“Hmph…” The crowd was stunned by Du Hongtao’s words. Though he described the golden book as extraordinary, they felt it wasn’t as impressive as Du Hongtao claimed. They thought Du Hongtao was trying to deceive them.

Du Hongtao obviously didn’t care about their opinions. Some people had already stared at the missing page of the Epoch Book with intense interest.

“Still, there are those who can recognize it,” Luo Tian observed the greedy gazes of several figures from the Three Great Sects and among the crowd toward the Epoch Book. He knew it wouldn’t be easy to obtain, even if he did.

“Ugh…” Luo Tian rubbed his head in frustration. Participating in the marriage trial meant he would win the missing page of the Epoch Book, but after obtaining it, trouble would follow.

Firstly, Ma Feiyang of the Sea-and-Mountain Sect. Then, he couldn’t marry Du Yuying—abandoning her would anger the Sea-and-Mountain Sect over face. Also, those who coveted the Epoch Book—like the Jin Chan Sect and the Chongxiao Sect’s headmasters—were also eyeing it with interest.

“Alright, no more talk. Now, please have the representatives of each sect step forward!” Du Hongtao clearly didn’t want anyone to think too long. He smiled and addressed the crowd.

Chapter 887: The Location of the Epoch Book

On the high platform of the Sea-and-Mountain Sect, Luo Tian stood among the crowd. Though the platform below was teeming with people, only about a thousand individuals were present atop it—these were the top talents of the Fire Domain’s most powerful sects. All possessed formidable strength and Dan skills, yet they were also arrogant.

Luo Tian’s presence naturally drew attention. After all, the Tongtian Sect was well-known across the Fire Domain. Recently, discussions about the Tongtian Sect had been widespread, and as a disciple who had emerged from it, Luo Tian naturally became the subject of gossip.

“Are you from Tongtian Sect?” A mocking voice echoed through the crowd, like a rolling thunder that made the thousand people on the platform startle.

“Ma Tianyang of the Sea-and-Mountain Sect!” People saw a young man radiating golden light step toward Luo Tian in the crowd. He was an arrogant youth, speaking with a tone of superiority.

Ma Tianyang, the direct descendant of the Sea-and-Mountain Sect’s Supreme Elder Ma Feiyang. He was the current Holy Son of the Sea-and-Mountain Sect, at the half-Holy Realm level. Like Du Yuying, he was a prodigy of the Sea-and-Mountain Sect, supporting its younger generation.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian nodded slightly. His expression was calm and indifferent, always thinking about how to safely leave after obtaining the missing page of the Epoch Book.

“Hmph. So you’re from Tongtian Sect?” Ma Tianyang looked down on Luo Tian, as if addressing a subordinate.

“Hmph. I am,” Luo Tian said calmly, his mind preoccupied with how to escape after obtaining the missing page of the Epoch Book.

“Hmph. So you killed my uncle Ma Tongtian? Don’t lie—there were many people present when you killed him. You can’t hide it forever!” Ma Tianyang spoke with a tone of superiority.

“You’re crazy. When did I admit to killing Ma Tongtian? You didn’t ask, so why would I shout it out? Do you think everyone’s like you—killing a Transcendent Realm powerhouse and then announcing it to the world?” Luo Tian was clearly angered by Ma Tianyang’s attitude. He retorted, causing a stir among the crowd.

“Ma Tongtian was killed by this Luo Tian? My god! What level has this young man reached? No wonder I couldn’t sense his cultivation!” People gazed at the remarkably youthful Luo Tian, lamenting their ignorance.

The only representative of the Cloud-Dispersing Sect, Ding Pengzu, stood nearby and was stunned. Initially, he had felt uneasy knowing Luo Tian was from Tongtian Sect. Now, hearing that Luo Tian had killed Ma Tongtian—a Transcendent Realm powerhouse—his gaze toward Luo Tian was filled with deep fear.

Luo Tian and Ma Tianyang’s exchange caused a stir. Even the Three Sect Heads showed interest in Luo Tian.

“Is that youth who killed Ma Tongtian?” Du Hongtao’s gaze was deep as he asked Ma Feiyang.

“Yes. It was this kid who killed Ma Tongtian!” Ma Feiyang’s expression darkened, answering Du Hongtao with anger. Ma Tongtian was his nephew—his position relied on Ma Feiyang’s support and the Sea-and-Mountain Sect’s power.

“Hmph. He seems decent. If he performs well in this Dan competition, I can let him live. But if he’s mediocre, you decide,” Du Hongtao said calmly, not continuing further.

“Yes!” Ma Feiyang’s face lit up. He knew his Grandmaster’s standards were high. Du Hongtao’s approval meant he was comparable to the Holy Sons and Daughters. In Ma Feiyang’s view, this unknown kid from nowhere could never match the Holy Sons and Daughters.

“Hmph. That kid seems promising, but he still has a long way to go before matching the Holy Sons and Daughters of the Three Great Sects. Seems like this kid is doomed!” Jin Jingtian of the Jin Chan Sect and Lu Hantu of the Chongxiao Temple smiled, commenting.

Clearly, the two sect heads also didn’t believe in Luo Tian. If he truly surpassed the Holy Sons and Daughters, without any backing, it would be a miracle.

“Arrogance is good, but one must have the strength to back it up!” Ma Tianyang, hearing Luo Tian’s retort, was furious but smiled coldly.

“Ma Tianyang, this kid has a grudge with you? A sect like Tongtian Sect—should I help you eliminate them?” A graceful youth in white robes smiled, scrutinizing Luo Tian.

“That’s Jin Tianlu of the Jin Chan Sect. He’s long desired Du Yuying. His cultivation is half-Holy Realm, and his Dan skills are exquisite. This Dan competition seems promising!” People gazed at Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu.

“Hmph. You two really have a heart for this! Still chatting here!” Jin Tianlu’s words had just finished when another mocking voice echoed. A youth in a Daoist robe slowly stepped into view.

“Chongxiao Temple’s Lu Tianyu. I heard Chongxiao Sect doesn’t marry—why is he participating in this marriage trial?” People gazed at Lu Tianyu, confused.

Seeing Lu Tianyu, Ma Tianyang and Jin Tianlu’s brows furrowed deeply. They knew Lu Tianyu’s strength—among the Holy Sons and Daughters, he was undoubtedly the top. If he participated in the Dan competition, their chances would be slim.

“Don’t worry. I’m Du Yuying’s sworn elder brother. If you want to marry my sister, first you must pass this test. Otherwise, I won’t agree!” Seeing their tension, Lu Tianyu smiled and explained.

“Brother, good luck!” Lu Tianyu lightly approached Luo Tian and patted his shoulder.

This made the crowd’s gaze toward Luo Tian change. With Lu Tianyu’s approval, Luo Tian’s status had risen significantly in their eyes.

Luo Tian smiled bitterly. Though he wanted to stay low-key, he knew if he truly won first place, he couldn’t remain low-key. He gave Lu Tianyu a slight bow: “I’ll do my best!”

“Alright, find your place and prepare to refine Dan!” Du Hongtao felt everyone had gathered on the platform. He spoke with authority.

Ma Tianyang, who had wanted to mock further, heard Du Hongtao’s words and glared at Luo Tian before returning to his spot.

“Wang…” Just as Du Hongtao was about to announce the start, a wave resonated. A beam of golden light pierced through the sky, drawing everyone’s attention.

“Who is so bold to fly under the Three Sect Heads’ eyes?” People wore expressions of mockery, gazing at the golden light.

The Three Sect Heads also furrowed their brows but upon seeing who it was, shook their heads slightly.

“Brat, get down!” Du Hongtao’s face was stern but carried a hint of affection as he scolded.

“Father… I want to participate!” A breeze blew, and her voice reached everyone’s ears before she appeared.

“Father? That’s Du Yuying!” The crowd, hearing her call to Du Hongtao, became chaotic again. They gazed at the sky, eager to witness this woman who had drawn so many young men from across the Fire Domain.

Luo Tian was also interested, eager to see this woman who had stirred the entire Fire Domain.

As everyone watched expectantly, golden light flickered, and Du Yuying’s true form appeared.

She wore a pink robe, her skin as white as snow. Her long hair flowed gracefully. She looked no older than ten but had an alluring figure, especially her lively eyes—like a forest spirit. She was breathtakingly beautiful.

“Beautiful…” Many people were captivated by Du Yuying at first glance.

Luo Tian also raised an eyebrow, his eyes filled with admiration. He had seen many beautiful women—his three wives were all exquisite—but Du Yuying was a different kind of beauty, one that felt lively and natural.

However, Luo Tian didn’t dwell on it. This woman felt like his younger sister to him, and he couldn’t develop feelings for her.

“Fool!” Luo Tian glared at Ma Tianyang and Lu Tianyu, who were staring with lustful eyes. How could they even consider such a child?

“Don’t be foolish! Who let you out?” Du Hongtao lightly patted his forehead, inwardly cursing the servants for their negligence. He had locked her up before but hadn’t expected her to escape.

“I’m holding a marriage trial. How can you be worse than me? I don’t care, but I’m participating!” Du Yuying pouted and flew toward Ding Pengzu. She pointed at him: “You, get down! You’re eliminated!”
