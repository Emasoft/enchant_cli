Luotian sat cross-legged on the ground, his entire body trembling as invisible waves of energy battered his robes. His black hair began to flutter in the wind, and an audacious aura radiated from him.

At the same time, his Nascent Souls within the dantian shattered two more times, deepening the pallor of his face.

"Let's do it!" Luotian roared again, and the remaining three Nascent Souls finally converged. A surging tide of Epoch Power swept through Luotian's body.

"Crack... crack..." A series of cracking sounds rose from Luotian's form as the Epoch Power contained within his nine Nascent Souls spread through his meridians. His already vast meridians expanded three or four times in size, their surfaces riddled with cracks as if they could burst at any moment. His body also swelled significantly, appearing much plumper.

If anyone saw Luotian's condition, they would be stunned by his audacity. His actions clearly resembled self-erasing one's cultivation, severing his own foundation completely.

"Since the path ahead is cut off, why not forge my own?" Luotian recalled the voice from the illusion, his mind roaring with madness.

"Only by pushing oneself to the brink can one find a new path!" Luotian's eyes gleamed with determination. To achieve something extraordinary, one must not cling to convention—this was a lesson Luotian had learned over the years. If he followed conventional cultivation, he might still be at the Saint level now.

"Death before life!" Luotian's eyes flashed with brilliant light as he let the Epoch Power in his dantian relentlessly冲击 his body, his gaze filled with contemplation.

"Evolve!" Luotian waved his hands, and the Cyclic Heaven Art controlled the furious Epoch Power within his body.

As the Cyclic Heaven Art circulated, the surging Epoch Power gradually flowed with order through Luotian's body, compressing toward his dantian.

After relentless compression, the pure white Epoch Power finally returned to Luotian's dantian, transforming into gold.

"Primordial Heaven Palace!" Luotian continuously simulated the process, first envisioning this power manifesting as his familiar Primordial Heaven Palace to see what would happen.

The surging Epoch Power in Luotian's dantian churned, gradually forming the image of a golden palace. An immense aura radiated from Luotian, and an overwhelming pressure spread through the hall, even affecting Sun Mengru and Runchenyu within the illusion.

After Luotian's continuous simulation, the golden Primordial Heaven Palace finally solidified within his dantian, earning a flicker of joy on his face.

"Did it work?" But soon after, Luotian's brows furrowed slightly. He could sense the power of the Primordial Heaven Palace was immense, and if it were fully stabilized, with sufficient cultivation, entering the Epoch Lord realm would merely be a matter of time.

"But no... The Primordial Heaven Palace bears Master Menglingyun's shadow and the techniques of the Ancient Ancestors—it does not belong to me!" Luotian felt the state of the Primordial Heaven Palace within his dantian, yet his expression remained resolute.

"Boom..." Without hesitation, the golden Primordial Heaven Palace shattered again within Luotian's dantian, causing his face to twist in pain.

"Ah..." The power surged, and blood spurted from Luotian's pores. This time, he nearly burst under the terrifying Epoch Power.

"Epoch Treasures and Royal Weapons are useless! I must evolve something that has never existed before!" Luotian's eyes flashed with ruthless determination. If Sun Mengru and the others were conscious, they would know Luotian was about to push himself to extremes—this was his ruthless nature; without madness, there is no survival.

"Epoch Scripture!" Luotian then thought of the Epoch Scripture. Though the Epoch Power surged within his dantian, the scripture remained as steady as a mountain.

Luotian had always revered the Epoch Scripture; he still hadn't unraveled its secrets, only knowing it was a patriarch who had saved his life countless times in danger.

"Buzz..." Under Luotian's incitement, the Epoch Power transformed into pages of golden paper, each one immensely powerful.

However, as Luotian began his simulation, a strange aura suddenly surged from all directions into him, rushing into his dantian.

"Boom... boom... boom..." The thunderous sound echoed again within Luotian's dantian, and he spat blood, his face filled with terror.

When Luotian reached the third page of the Epoch Scripture, he felt as if he had touched a forbidden boundary, losing control. The three pages of the Epoch Scripture suddenly shattered.

"I cannot continue evolving—otherwise, I will die!" Luotian muttered to himself, his eyes filled with horror. A strange thought had suddenly emerged in his mind.

"The Epoch Scripture is no good, nor are the Epoch Treasures!" Luotian then controlled the surging Epoch Power within his dantian again, his face showing confusion.

"Epoch Passage!" Luotian then thought of another enigmatic thing—his Epoch Passage.

Realizing this, Luotian hesitated no longer and began to simulate it slowly. The Epoch Power within his dantian gradually transformed.

A humming sound echoed, and after Luotian's continuous simulation, a golden passage formed within his dantian. Though not gray, it exuded the same aura as an Epoch Passage.

"Still no good..." Luotian furrowed his brows deeply, sensing the Epoch Passage within his dantian was far too different from those he had encountered before.

"Too greedy!" Luotian's face then showed a faint smile, knowing his current strength was insufficient to evolve a complete Epoch Passage.

"Then let's settle for an Epoch Bridge!" Luotian recalled the Epoch Bridge he had once used to mend his Epoch Passage, a smile appearing on his face.

With the goal set, Luotian finally calmed down and began simulating again, waves of energy radiating from his body.

"One hour... two hours..." Time flowed slowly as Luotian meticulously simulated, and the Epoch Bridge appeared flawlessly within his dantian.

A golden bridge of flowing gold spanned across Luotian's dantian, its surface shimmering with divine light, resembling the soul transmigrations within an Epoch Passage.

"It's done..." Luotian's face then showed great joy, and a surging aura burst from his body.

As this power surged outward, Sun Mengru, Runchenyu, and Miao Dedu awoke gradually under this aura, their faces filled with confusion before becoming clear.

"What's going on?" They then saw Luotian seated cross-legged, their eyes filled with confusion.

"Although I haven't entered the Epoch Lord realm, if I fully evolve the Epoch Passage, I will definitely ascend to it!" Luotian's face showed a hint of joy as he slowly opened his eyes. At this moment, he had taken another step closer to the Epoch Lord realm.

"Luotian..." As Luotian opened his eyes, Sun Mengru and Miao Dedu felt a momentary dizziness, as if they had fallen into a quagmire.

Though only for an instant, it left them stunned. They then carefully observed Luotian.

"Luotian! Have you entered the Epoch Lord realm?" Their eyes shone with intense joy, their gazes fixed on Luotian.

"Your talent is unparalleled in my life!" Runchenyu's face showed admiration, his voice soft.

"I haven't entered the Epoch Lord realm yet; I've merely understood some things!" Luotian waved his hand, and a clean robe replaced his soiled one.

"Feel for yourselves the gains from the illusion. If you've truly grasped it, I'll give you a great gift as compensation for awakening you from the illusion!" Luotian smiled, confident that Sun Mengru and others had also made significant gains in the illusion.

"A great gift?"

"Compensation?" Upon hearing Luotian's words, Miao Dedu and the others' faces instantly turned greedy, their eyes filled with anticipation as they looked at Luotian.

"What did you experience in the illusion?" Luotian then asked, his face showing curiosity as he looked at Sun Mengru and Miao Dedu.

Chapter 1591: Each Gains Their Own

Upon hearing Luotian's words, Sun Mengru and Miao Dedu's expressions varied as they looked at each other.

"In the illusion, I found my physical body and became an Epoch Lord!" Guy Yongkang smiled, addressing Luotian and the others before cautiously glancing at him. He wouldn't dare admit he had possessed Luotian's body in front of him.

"In the illusion, I found countless immortal tombs and opened them! I discovered countless treasures!" Sun Kemin spoke next, his eyes glowing with intensity.

"Truly a dog can't change its nature!" Hearing Sun Kemin's words, everyone was speechless. They hadn't expected him to be so greedy in the illusion.

Others also recounted their experiences, naturally tied to their personalities. Chen Zhanbiao was a typical glutton, Zheng Xin debated the world, Runchenyu healed others. Finally, only Miao Dedu stood there stammering, his face flushed and unwilling to speak.

"Damn it, this is so embarrassing!" Miao Dedu muttered internally, recalling the scenes in the illusion.

"Miao Dedu, it's your turn! Tell us what you experienced in the illusion!" Xu Liyi and Zheng Xin looked at Miao Dedu's flushed face, their spirits lifting as they pressed him.

"No... nothing!" Miao Dedu quickly chuckled, then his face turned solemn.

"Considering your personality, you must have become a world-shaking immortal! Then you strut around showing off!" Zheng Xin's face showed disdain as he addressed Miao Dedu, prompting everyone to laugh.

"No, if that were the case, why would you be ashamed to say it? There must be something else!" Xu Liyi's eyes flickered, then he looked at Miao Dedu with ill intent.

"Yes, doggy, hurry up and tell us what happened!" Zheng Xin and the others surrounded Miao Dedu, their faces filled with intense curiosity.

"I said nothing! You're right, I did become a world-shaking immortal!" Miao Dedu's face showed anger as he addressed them.

"Confess, or we'll beat you up!" They knew Miao Dedu was lying.

"Your nose twitched; you're lying! Confess quickly!" They threatened, their hands clapping rhythmically, the clear sound echoing in their hands. Clearly, if Miao Dedu didn't confess, they would attack him.

Luotian smiled as he watched the group, though their actions made him a bit exasperated. He knew this was how they fostered friendship; otherwise, their personalities would have caused problems.

"Silence..." Miao Dedu gritted his teeth, determined to keep his mouth shut.

"Go..." As Miao Dedu's words ended, Xu Liyi and the others didn't hold back, rushing toward Miao Dedu.

"Let Runchenyu see the laughter!" Luotian smiled, watching Miao Dedu's cries under their hands, addressing Runchenyu.

"True character!" Runchenyu shook his head lightly. As the son of an Epoch Lord, he had always been under the光环 of his father and mother since birth. He hadn't made friends before, so he felt something different in Luotian's group—friendship.

Miao Dedu and Zheng Xin, though they often joked around, Runchenyu knew that if any of them were in trouble, the others would definitely not stand by.

"Ah... I give up! You're satisfied now, Zheng Xin! Give me back my stuff!" Miao Dedu finally couldn't withstand their torment and shouted for mercy.

"Cut it out, you should have said that earlier!" Zheng Xin and the others showed disdain, no longer tormenting Miao Dedu.

"Damn it!" Miao Dedu's face was bruised, his clothes disheveled as if he had been violated by dozens of men. His face showed sorrow.

"I saw myself turn into a dog in the illusion! Are you satisfied now!" Miao Dedu's face turned red as he roared at Zheng Xin and the others.

"Haha..." As Miao Dedu's words ended, everyone burst into laughter, even Luotian, Sun Mengru, and Runchenyu.

"Doggy, you really are a gem..." Zheng Xin laughed, looking at Miao Dedu, but then bent over again.

"Doggy, you've truly earned your name!" Others also laughed without hesitation.

"I didn't know it would turn out like that, this illusion is terrible!" Miao Dedu almost cried, feeling he had truly embarrassed himself.

"It's your own fault for always shouting and yelling! You've driven me to psychological trauma!" Miao Dedu then loudly defended himself, but it had no effect.

"Alright..." After everyone laughed for a while, Luotian felt it was enough; otherwise, Miao Dedu might have become depressed.

"Yes!" Zheng Xin and the others heard Luotian's words, their laughter ceased. They knew when to stop.

"Reflect on your experiences in the illusion carefully; it's crucial for ascending to the Epoch Lord realm!" Luotian addressed them. This kind of thing couldn't be taught, only understood through personal insight.

Upon hearing Luotian's words, their faces grew more solemn. They had seen Luotian's transformation and could guess the illusion wasn't simple. They all sat cross-legged on the ground, beginning to think seriously. The hall fell into silence.

Luotian also remained silent, observing the hall to see if there were any other treasures and guarding Sun Mengru and others while they transformed.

The hall was unusually vast, its decorations somewhat luxurious but nothing particularly notable. The only thing that intrigued Luotian was a small, unassuming water cup on the desk nearby.

The cup was jade-made, appearing luxurious, but considering this was a place left by an Epoch Lord, Luotian simply accepted it. However, he felt a strange fluctuation on the cup.

Curious, Luotian approached the desk and picked up the jade water cup.

"Crash..." As he lifted the cup, Luotian's expression slightly changed, his gaze turning serious.

"There's still water in this cup!" Luotian couldn't help but exclaim, his eyes filled with disbelief.

"How is that possible!" Luotian looked at the cup still half-full of water, his eyes showing confusion. The water seemed ordinary.

"Is there someone living in this bone hall?" Luotian's mind jolted, and he became tense. He quickly moved back to Sun Mengru and others' side, fearing any mishap.

"Ghahaha... I'll wait for you!" As Luotian returned to Sun Mengru and others, a laugh echoed in his ears. The water cup in his hand shattered instantly, and the water inside splashed onto Luotian's body.

"Hiss..." White smoke rose from Luotian's body, and his white robe was corroded by the seemingly ordinary water. His face showed a hint of seriousness.

Luotian's current status was no trivial matter; his robe wasn't an ordinary item. To corrode it, this water must be extraordinary.

Even more terrifying was that Luotian hadn't noticed anything in the water, which left him deeply alarmed.

"Damn it!" Luotian cursed under his breath and extended his hand, white Epoch Power surging from it. He directed it toward the liquid corroding his robe and penetrating his body.

However, Luotian's speed was too slow; before his hand could land, the corrosive liquid touched his body.

"Hisss..." White smoke rose from Luotian's body, even his powerful physique couldn't withstand the liquid's corrosion.

Pain instantly invaded Luotian's body, as if burned by something hot, making his face grim.

But the pain was only for a moment; then the water-like liquid slithered along Luotian's body like a snake, landing on his neck and forming a strange mark.

"What is this thing!" Luotian felt an ominous premonition. Though the voice had only echoed in his mind, he could sense its evil intent. Just the sound alone made him shiver; this bone forest was filled with sinister energy, and he knew this mark wasn't good.

"What's wrong?" As Luotian's face darkened, Runchenyu opened his eyes first. As the son of an Epoch Lord, he clearly understood his future path.

"I've encountered some trouble!" Luotian spoke softly, recounting the strange incident to Runchenyu. This made Runchenyu's face change slightly.

"Let me check!" Runchenyu's gaze was serious as he placed his hand on Luotian's arm. Green Epoch Power flowed from Runchenyu's hands into Luotian's body.

After nearly a quarter of an hour, Runchenyu withdrew his hand, his eyes filled with confusion. "Nothing strange found!"

Chapter 1592: Nine Dragons Surrounding a Pearl

"Even you didn't find anything strange?" Luotian's face showed disappointment. He knew Runchenyu's medical skills were unparalleled, and he had thoroughly studied the human body.

"Yes, there's nothing strange here! However, this bone hall has definitely changed. When my father built this palace, it wasn't like this. It's as if the blood I used to open the door before couldn't do it, and only a complete Epoch Lord's bone could. Something must have changed here, and it was definitely done by someone with monstrous power."

"Who could change an Epoch Lord's methods!" Luotian's face showed deep concern. Few people in the world could achieve this, so he felt even more dangerous.

"Never mind for now; when the mountain comes, there will be a path. This entity hasn't attacked us yet, so it must have some hesitation. Next, be careful in the second level!" Luotian sighed deeply.

Time flowed slowly as Luotian and Runchenyu waited for Sun Mengru's group to awaken, guarding them again. This time, Luotian was more cautious and didn't look around recklessly.

After a day's wait, Sun Mengru and others opened their eyes one by one, their faces filled with excitement, clearly having gained much.

"Luotian, Luotian! Tell us your surprise!" They then looked at Luotian with excitement, recalling his earlier words.

"You've all found your paths. I have some Epoch Power; let's all refine it together!" Luotian smiled.

"Haha, so quickly, you can ascend to the Epoch Lord!" Hearing Luotian's words, Miao Dedu and Zheng Xin's faces showed joy.

"Damn it, when I get out, I'll hang all the Epoch Lord's sons and beat them! Let them not act so high and mighty!" Miao Dedu shouted, thinking of a chance to show off.

At this moment, the sons of Epoch Lords had just awakened, their cultivation mostly at the peak of Epoch Power. If they became Epoch Lords, they would definitely be ahead of others by a step. With their talent, they were one level higher than the sons of Epoch Lords; thus, the sons of Epoch Lords wouldn't have a good time in their hands.

Even Sun Mengru and Runchenyu showed disbelief, looking at Luotian, surprised he had given them such a big gift.

"Don't get too excited..." Luotian's forehead flashed with several black lines, surprised that these guys had such wild thoughts. The Epoch Power capable of making them become Epoch Lords would be enough for him to reach the Epoch Lord level alone.

"Uh..." Upon hearing Luotian's words, Miao Dedu and the others snapped out of their excitement.

"I meant to improve your cultivation, not make you become Epoch Lords!" Luotian spoke, then waved his hand. A black yin fish hovered above their heads.

"Kid, think carefully; this much Epoch Power is enough for you to become an Epoch Lord. Are you really going to give it to these little bastards?" The yin fish's voice echoed in Luotian's ears, filled with a hint of admiration.

"Give it!" Luotian thought of the terrifying experience in the illusion and sighed softly; he didn't want to grow alone.

"Okay, but you're the master, so it's your decision!" The yin fish replied softly, though slightly regretful, its voice filled with strong approval.

"Buzz..." The humming sound echoed as divine light poured from the black yin fish, descending upon Luotian and his group. Their bodies trembled slightly.

"This is pure cultivation power!"

"One of these alone could equal a hundred days of hard training for me!" Zheng Xin and the others showed joy.

"Alright, everyone refine this cultivation power together!" Luotian addressed them and sat cross-legged on the ground. The Cyclic Heaven Art was activated, absorbing the pure Epoch Power extracted from endless bones by the yin fish.

Others also showed joy, sitting cross-legged to refine it. Only Guy Yongkang, the puppet, and Runchenyu stood there.

Guy Yongkang was a puppet, though lifelike, he couldn't cultivate. Runchenyu felt awkward, having spent little time with Luotian and not wanting to take his resources.

"Master Runchenyu, join us!" However, Luotian's voice echoed in Runchenyu's mind. Runchenyu's eyes showed a hint of joy as he sat cross-legged on the ground; some emotions didn't need to be spoken.

The hall fell silent again as everyone began to refine the surging and pure Epoch Power, their cultivation gradually rising.

Within Luotian's dantian, the golden Epoch Bridge also expanded and solidified as his cultivation improved.

"These little guys are really lucky!" The spirit of the yin fish, now a skeleton-like figure, appeared above their heads.

The yang fish, following the yin fish's example, transformed into a skeleton-like form.

"But why don't we know what this mark on Luotian's neck is?" The yang fish then spoke, looking at the mark that flickered in and out as Luotian refined the Epoch Power. Its voice was filled with confusion.

"It's probably not good. This thing gave me a terrifying feeling, though it looked simple, I felt it was complex. It's definitely not something ordinary people could perform. I don't know what this mark is!" The yin and yang voices were filled with seriousness, their gazes on Luotian, showing concern.

"Never mind; this kid is no ordinary person. His luck is amazing. He might turn danger into safety!" The yang fish spoke next.

Time flowed slowly as the black yin fish spewed for seven days before calming down. Luotian and others gradually awoke from their cultivation state, all showing joy on their faces, including Luotian.

"If this happened again, my dantian's Epoch Passage would be fully evolved!" Luotian smiled slightly, his gaze filled with regret. Such a rapid cultivation boost was an opportunity few could miss.

"Nothing left?" Miao Dedu and the others showed greed, looking at the yin fish hovering above their heads. Their voices were filled with expectation.

"Kid, be grateful!" The yin fish spirit stood beside the yin fish, looking at Miao Dedu and the others with exasperation. They were treating him like a cow.

"Alright, let's go. We'll enter the next level; I wonder what opportunities it holds!" Luotian smiled, looking at the stairs leading to the second level of the bone hall.

They nodded; their current strength had improved compared to before, though they hadn't entered the Epoch Lord realm. Given time, except for Guy Yongkang, the puppet, they would definitely become Epoch Lords without a doubt.

Including Luotian himself, ten Epoch Lords—what an overwhelming force! Even the ancient kings had no such number of Epoch Lords.

Luotian and Runchenyu stepped forward, leading the way along the golden corridor toward the second level.

Not long after, they stepped into the second level of the hall.

"Ugh..." As they entered the second level, a series of mournful sounds echoed in Luotian's ears. Unlike the first level's safety, as soon as they entered, a sense of danger filled their hearts.

The hall was equally vast. The most eye-catching feature was a green ancient coffin hovering above an altar covered with complex patterns.

Around the coffin were scattered bones, but these bones seemed to follow a pattern, surrounding the altar in a formation.

"This is where my father built his final resting place!" Runchenyu's face showed excitement, looking at the green ancient coffin in the center of the hall.

"But this bone hall only has two levels? Shouldn't your father have placed his coffin at the top?" Zheng Xin and others looked at Runchenyu with confusion.

"I'm not sure; maybe someone moved my father's coffin here!" Runchenyu looked confused after hearing Zheng Xin's words.

"Impossible, who could move an Epoch Lord's coffin!" Hearing Runchenyu's words, Luotian and the others inhaled sharply, feeling this bone hall was even more terrifying.

"Coffins, I like them!" Sun Kemin showed greed, looking at the green coffin in the center of the hall and licking his lips. He was clearly a professional.

"Unbelievable!" But Sun Kemin wasn't foolish; the final resting place of an Epoch Lord wouldn't be simple.

"What's wrong?" Hearing Sun Kemin's words, Luotian and the others showed confusion. Sun Kemin was clearly an expert in grave robbing.

"Did you notice the bone formation around the coffin?" Sun Kemin pointed with his hand, indicating nine directions.

"Why does it look so familiar? It looks like dragon heads?" Zheng Xin and others showed confusion, looking at the bone formation.

"Yes, it's definitely dragons. This formation resembles nine bone dragons circling around the coffin, which in our jargon is called 'Nine Dragons Surrounding a Pearl'!" Sun Kemin's face showed seriousness, looking at the green coffin in the center of the hall.

"Nine Dragons Surrounding a Pearl!" Hearing Sun Kemin's words, Wan Lingkong's face also slightly changed, his eyes filled with disbelief.

Chapter 1593: Opening the Coffin
