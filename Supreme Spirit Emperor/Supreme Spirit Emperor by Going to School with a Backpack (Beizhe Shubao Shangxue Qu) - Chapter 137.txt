“Even this doesn’t kill him—what kind of monster is he?” the people shouted, disbelief making them rub their eyes.

“Body-Realm Sovereign?” Gu Qianxue furrowed her brows, eyes filled with caution as she gazed at the Cave Temple Spirit.

“Impossible to resist!” The people saw the nearly undamaged Cave Temple Spirit, and a voice of helplessness echoed in their hearts. A sense of powerlessness rose within them.

Thousands of soul-gathering techniques, the combined strike of Nascent Soul realm masters—yet not even a scratch could be made. Just with this body, the creature could walk unchallenged across the Tianyuan Continent.

“Everyone, run as far as you can!” As despair gripped them, Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed in their ears, drawing their gazes to him.

“Luo Tian!” Gu Qianxue turned, her eyes filled with concern as she sensed Luo Tian’s abnormal state.

At that moment, Luo Tian’s body seemed to swell immensely, his form grotesquely swollen. His aura surged violently, seven-colored energy swirling around him. His already wounded body cracked further, blood oozing from the fissures.

“Wum…” Luo Tian’s face curled into a smile as his hands formed the King’s Seal and the Soul-Stealing Seal, merging them seamlessly.

In the void, the Golden Kai Tian Seal slowly materialized, three seals fusing together.

“Kid, this trick again—no use on me!” The Cave Temple Spirit sneered, disdain in its eyes.

“But! What if I add this?” Luo Tian snorted, a wisp of gray energy escaping his fingers, coiling around them.

“Luo Tian, you!” Zheng Xin’s face paled in shock, realizing what Luo Tian intended.

“Luo Tian, don’t be reckless!” Gu Qianxue’s face showed urgency as she rushed to his side, shouting.

“Everyone, get as far as you can!” Zheng Xin barked at the crowd, surprising them.

Some former disciples of Wenxin Sect turned pale, their bodies flashing like lightning as they fled without hesitation, recalling a nightmare from memory.

Seeing others flee, the rest followed suit, carrying the injured Tian Luo and Xiu away.

“Joining chaos power? What can you do?” The Cave Temple Spirit sneered, allowing the crowd to leave without stopping them.

“Luo Tian, what are you doing? Don’t be reckless—there are many ways to avenge!” Zheng Xin shouted.

Gu Qianxue, however, remained serene, standing before Luo Tian. She knew he would not change his mind once decided.

“Gu Lei, take your sister and go!” Luo Tian called to the stunned Gu Lei, his face softening as he gazed at Gu Qianxue.

“You live, I live; you die, I die!” Gu Qianxue whispered, her gaze resolute. Luo Tian’s body trembled slightly.

“Wicked one! Do you remember me?” A calm voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears, halting his gray energy.

Chapter 671: Jiang Nanxuan Appears ()

Chapter 671: Jiang Nanxuan Appears

“Jiang Nanxuan!” Luo Tian’s ears perked at the voice, his gray energy pausing. He hadn’t expected Jiang Nanxuan—vanished since entering Daoist Cliff—to appear now.

Two white-clad figures approached from the distance. Jiang Nanxuan’s face remained calm, but Luo Tian detected a chilling glint in his eyes.

“Luo Tian, leave the rest to me,” Jiang Nanxuan nodded, his voice gentle. It calmed Luo Tian’s violent mindset.

A phoenix’s cry echoed as Meng Yao smiled, black flames erupting from her body, forming a black phoenix circling the Cave Temple Spirit’s head.

Initially dismissing Jiang Nanxuan as an ordinary man, the Cave Temple Spirit’s face paled upon seeing the black flames.

“Ming Feng!” The Cave Temple Spirit gaped, its face sweating as it stared at Jiang Nanxuan and Meng Yao. Its features gradually merged with a memory of an unforgettable figure.

“Hmph,” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, gazing at Jiang Nanxuan and the Cave Temple Spirit. He sensed their faces bore a strange resemblance.

“Pang…” Luo Tian’s energy seal dissolved, the gray chaos power returning to his body.

Luo Tian knew Jiang Nanxuan’s words meant he had a plan—his instinctive trust in Jiang Nanxuan.

“Wicked one, do you recognize me?” Jiang Nanxuan spoke, stepping within a hundred paces of the Cave Temple Spirit. His face bore a faint sigh as he gazed at the spirit controlling the Body-Realm Sovereign’s body.

“Who are you?” The Cave Temple Spirit’s face was drenched in sweat, its body trembling. Its eyes held terror, though Jiang Nanxuan seemed ordinary. Yet to the spirit, he loomed like a giant.

“Leave!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke, raising a banner in his hand and planting it into the ground. Meanwhile, Meng Yao’s fingers twitched, and the black flames coalescing into a phoenix formed runes, surging toward the Cave Temple Spirit.

“Mistress…” The Cave Temple Spirit stammered, fear in its voice. It dared not move.

“What?” Luo Tian and Zheng Xin exchanged glances, their faces shifting. Hearing the Cave Temple Spirit’s words, they were stunned. They gazed at Jiang Nanxuan’s calm eyes, filled with disbelief.

“Mistress?” Zheng Xin stood frozen, understanding the implication of the Cave Temple Spirit’s word. He could not speak.

Luo Tian was also stunned. He hadn’t expected Jiang Nanxuan, whom he’d called brother, to be such a formidable figure.

The black flames condensed into runes, forming chains that pierced the Cave Temple Spirit’s body, pulling it out of its host.

“Ah… mercy, mistress!” The black soul was dragged out, crying and begging for life.

The Cave Temple Spirit was truly terrified. It hadn’t expected to meet the true master of its body. Though Jiang Nanxuan seemed ordinary, the overwhelming pressure made it powerless. It could only let the black flame chains drag it out.

At that moment, Daoist Cliff was shattered. The Cave Temple Spirit had lost its body and nowhere to hide. Unlike ordinary souls, it would die if exposed too long in the air. Worse still, the black flames continued to burn it.

“Wicked one, I reincarnated, yet you occupied my body here!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, his tone calm but chilling.

“Not only that, you slaughtered geniuses here! Regardless of which reason, you deserve death!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke to Meng Yao.

“Kill it!” Jiang Nanxuan said, as if crushing an ant.

“Shi…” Meng Yao smiled, her hand sweeping through the air. Under the black flames’ burning, the Cave Temple Spirit dissolved into swirling smoke.

“This…” Zheng Xin and others were speechless, watching Jiang Nanxuan and Meng Yao effortlessly destroy the Cave Temple Spirit.

“Crack…” But in an instant, people’s gazes shifted to Luo Tian.

At that moment, Luo Tian’s body swelled again by threefold, his face flushed with a sickly red.

“Nanxuan Senior, save Luo Tian!” Zheng Xin spoke, sensing Luo Tian was like a bomb ready to explode.

“Not in a hurry, Nanxuan Senior. For our friendship, I beg you to save Qiu Chan. I know you can!” Luo Tian’s face bore entreaty, gazing at Jiang Nanxuan.

“Kid, you only care now? Where were you before?” Meng Yao’s face turned angry, glaring at Luo Tian.

Meng Yao and Qiu Chan were close; to her, Qiu Chan was like a sister. Now seeing Qiu Chan in such a plight, Meng Yao regarded Luo Tian coldly.

“I…

Luo Tian’s face bore shame and regret, unsure how to speak. Then his eyes hardened with resolve, his body emitting a brittle sound as he fell to his knees before Jiang Nanxuan and Meng Yao.

“I beg you, Nanxuan Senior! I beg you to save Qiu Chan. If she can live again, I…” Luo Tian shouted but stopped, his gaze shifting to Gu Qianxue.

“How are you?” Meng Yao asked Luo Tian, ignoring his near-exploding state.

“You married her!” Gu Qianxue’s eyes softened, nodding to Luo Tian before gazing at Meng Yao.

“Luo Senior, get up!” Jiang Nanxuan pulled Luo Tian up, a smile on his face as if mocking him.

Seeing Jiang Nanxuan’s expression, Luo Tian sighed bitterly, recalling Qiu Chan’s closer bond with the two.

Jiang Nanxuan wasted no words, his hands releasing array banners. His face remained calm while Meng Yao’s aura surged, placing the banners around Qiu Chan’s cooling body.

Ninety-nine array banners were densely planted before Qiu Chan, each with different colors.

After this, Jiang Nanxuan didn’t pause. His hands moved swiftly, and spiritual energy flowed into the banners.

“Ninety-nine to one, reversing yin-yang, turning reincarnation! Return!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, then pressed his palm to the ground.

Chapter 672: The Zhou Tian Cultivation Array ()

Chapter 672: The Zhou Tian Cultivation Array

As Jiang Nanxuan’s words faded, an invisible passage seemed to form in the sky. Though people couldn’t see it, they felt its presence.

“Reincarnation,” Luo Tian mused, recognizing the passage. His mother had once used a similar method to return to childhood, and his Reincarnation Fist was tied to reincarnation. Thus, he wasn’t unfamiliar with the passage.

“Wum…” As the passage appeared, Jiang Nanxuan’s array emitted a powerful suction, pulling into the reincarnation realm.

“This…” Zheng Xin gaped at the array, though the suction didn’t affect his soul. Yet he felt an urge to flee.

“Return, Qiu Chan!” Jiang Nanxuan’s voice echoed into the passage.

As his words ended, a piercing wail emerged from the passage, wisps of gray energy flowing toward Qiu Chan’s body.

“Hmph…” Meng Yao sneered, summoning a phoenix that burned the gray energy to ash.

“Found!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke, his eyes gleaming. He reached into the passage, pulling out a gray figure.

“Qiu Chan!” People gasped, stunned by the gray shadow. It was their first time witnessing such a miracle.

“Qiu Chan!” Luo Tian’s eyes brimmed with emotion, tears welling as he whispered, his body emitting another brittle sound before collapsing to the ground.

The gray Qiu Chan’s shadow, confused, flew toward her body, merging with the one restored by Gu Qianxue’s Wood-element energy.

“Huff…” Jiang Nanxuan exhaled, his face weary. The effort had clearly drained him.

“Hmph…” As Luo Tian and others watched, Qiu Chan let out a soft groan, opening her eyes. Her face was bewildered but soon recognized the chest she lay in.

Her gaze flickered with coldness, yet it felt familiar and warm.

“Luo Tian!” Qiu Chan realized the chest’s owner, tears streaming down her perfect face.

Qiu Chan now understood she had been revived. Her eyes glowed with joy, and she wrapped her arms around Luo Tian’s body.

This embrace caused Luo Tian to react instantly. After Daoist Cliff’s explosion, the twelve of them were battered. Though not naked, their attire was far from normal. They clung tightly, almost as if unclothed.

Qiu Chan felt a hot object pressing against her abdomen, discomforting her. Then she realized something, her face flushing red as she pushed Luo Tian away.

“Pervert!” Qiu Chan spat, gazing at Luo Tian.

“This is a normal physiological reaction,” Luo Tian awkwardly replied. His body, already stretched by energy, felt even more unbearable after Qiu Chan’s touch.

Feeling Luo Tian’s change, his body was barely human now. Qiu Chan’s face showed concern as she addressed Jiang Nanxuan: “Nanxuan Senior, save Luo Tian!”

Jiang Nanxuan nodded gently. Meng Yao smiled at Qiu Chan: “You’ve already turned to outsiders!”

“Alright, not only will I save him, but others’ strength can also be enhanced,” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, gazing at Qiu Chan, Xu Liyi, and Luo Han.

Hearing Jiang Nanxuan’s words, Xiu and others smiled. His miracle had already been witnessed.

At that moment, Jiang Nanxuan’s array banners flew again from his hands. He hadn’t finished yet; he summoned hundreds more from his storage bag, astonishing everyone.

“Ninth-grade array master!” People gasped at Jiang Nanxuan, unable to imagine anyone but a ninth-grade array master controlling so many banners.

“Pup… pup…” The earth cracked as eight hundred and ten banners spread around Luo Tian’s group, surrounding them within a thousand feet.

“Everyone, step back!” Jiang Nanxuan ordered Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei.

No one dared disobey. Originally, few surrounded Luo Tian’s group. Now Jiang Nanxuan commanded them to enter the array, and those with twelve imperial inheritances were left inside. Others retreated nearly a thousand feet.

“Zhou Tian Cultivation Array, open!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke, planting a golden banner into the array’s center. Then he and Meng Yao left the array.

As Jiang Nanxuan exited, he shouted: “This array will help you refine the energy pearls left by the twelve emperors in your bodies, advancing your cultivation! How far you go depends on your own fate!”

Jiang Nanxuan’s words ended, and Luo Tian—once about to burst—gradually slimmed down under Gu Qianxue’s watch, returning to his original state.

Qiu Chan and others felt the array absorbing worldly energy instead of feeding it into their bodies. Instead, immense pressure pressed upon them.

“Ah! By creating pressure, the array prevents us from exploding!” Tian Luo muttered, admiration in his eyes as he gazed at Jiang Nanxuan. He broke a blue pearl with his spiritual awareness, beginning to refine the energy.

Others followed suit, sitting cross-legged and refining their pearls.

Seeing the twelve stabilize, Jiang Nanxuan sighed, his body weak and swaying, supported by Meng Yao.

“You always overdo it… if only…” Meng Yao hesitated, her gaze on the界尊 (Sovereign) body of Si Kong Kaiyang.

Chapter 673: Just in Time ()

Chapter 673: Just in Time

“No need to say! I am Jiang Nanxuan, not Jiang Hongsheng!” Jiang Nanxuan spoke, his eyes resolute.

Seeing Jiang Nanxuan’s determined expression, Meng Yao softened, sighing deeply.

“Haha! We arrived just in time! A Sovereign’s body—what reward would it bring back!” As Jiang Nanxuan and Meng Yao spoke, a laugh echoed in their ears.

“Wum…” Insects’ hums filled the air, a dark cloud of bugs approaching, blocking sunlight.

If people observed closely, anything in the bug swarm’s path would freeze, its life fading.

“West Region!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face darkened, stepping toward his previous body to retrieve it.

“Let go!” A youth with a moon tattoo spoke softly, releasing a yellow talisman that flew toward Jiang Nanxuan’s Sovereign body.

“Go…!” Meng Yao’s eyes flashed cold, a black flame surging to burn the yellow talisman.

“Ming Feng? A fine thing indeed!” The black-cloaked youth’s eyes gleamed, gazing at Luo Tian’s group in the array. His lips curled slightly.

“They’re injured!” The youth smiled, his companions’ eyes reflecting greed.

“All are rare bodies! This trip to the Ancient Relic Site was worth it!” The West Region youths seemed to forget the thousands below, whispering.

“Unwelcome guests!” Jiang Nanxuan’s first smile was bitter. Now, he was an ordinary man; two arrays had drained him. These people clearly came for his previous body and Luo Tian’s group, leaving him helpless.

These dozen West Region youths radiated initial soul-accumulation stage energy. Clearly, they had great gains in the Ancient Relic Site. Plus their poison skills made Jiang Nanxuan feel uneasy.

“Mass attack? No, who doesn’t know poison-type bodies favor mass combat… array formation is too slow…” Jiang Nanxuan’s mind raced for solutions, but only one came: merging with the Sovereign body.

As Jiang Nanxuan pondered, the black-cloaked West Region geniuses flew above them.

“Go…” Eleven people waved their hands, swarms of bugs turning into black mist toward Luo Tian and Jiang Nanxuan’s previous body.

“No memory?” Meng Yao sneered, her hands moving swiftly. Black flames burned through the void, blocking the black bugs.

“Don’t meddle! You’ll regret it!” The lead youth sneered, wary of Meng Yao.

Meng Yao’s strength ranked among the top three in Luo Tian’s group; only Tian Luo could rival her.

“You insult me?” Meng Yao’s face turned icy, transforming into a black phoenix to attack the lead youth.

“I’ll test your talents!” The youth spoke, his voice playful. Purple energy surrounded him as blood qi erupted from his body, a terrifying aura charging toward Meng Yao.

“Everyone else leave! Who blocks us will face our wrath!” Another black-cloaked youth radiated soul-accumulation stage energy, addressing the thousands below.

“Hmph! What are you? I’ll see if your poison is stronger than mine!” Gu Lei’s face twisted with rage, unafraid of the soul-accumulation stage. Poison was his specialty.

“Be careful!” Gu Qianxue’s eyes flashed cold, fearing Gu Lei’s loss. Her sword qi surrounded him as she followed to attack a soul-accumulation stage West Region genius.

“Haha! Finally, I can fight! I was bored!” Chen Zhanbiao’s deep voice echoed as his mountain-like body charged a West Region youth, punching him.

“Come on! I’ll see if your Western geniuses are as good as you claim!” Ying Hongtu transformed into lightning, appearing beside Chen Zhanbiao. His fists crackled with thunder as he and Chen Zhanbiao attacked a soul-accumulation stage West Region youth.

Seeing others move, other regional geniuses roared and charged the West Region youths, their eyes burning with battle spirit.

“Look at them—they’re no good! Let’s fight and finish these brats!” People roared, their martial arts dazzling.

Luo Tian’s group remained silent, their bodies surrounded by dense energy, like twelve cocoons in the array.

Jiang Nanxuan gazed at his previous body, conflicted. He felt weak now. Though calm, he wasn’t without thoughts.

Being protected by Meng Yao repeatedly made him feel like a failure. Yet he knew if he merged with the body, these youths couldn’t withstand his gaze. But Jiang Nanxuan knew if he did so, he’d become the Sovereign Jiang Hongsheng.

This deep love made him reluctant to abandon Meng Yao, even if he might remember her. He feared whether he’d still love her as before.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound of battle echoed again over the destroyed Daoist Cliff.

Even with Gu Lei and Gu Qianxue’s combined strength, they barely held off these soul-accumulation stage masters. This was without Meng Yao’s black flames blocking the bugs. Otherwise, this place would already be littered with corpses. Bug poison was terrifying; Jiang Nanxuan knew it well.

Even so, more disciples fell from the sky, foaming at the mouth, their eyes dim. If not treated promptly, their life would vanish in moments.

Chapter 674: Killing Array ()

Chapter 674: Killing Array

Each time a Tianyuan Continent genius fell from the sky, Jiang Nanxuan’s face paled.

“This feeling is terrible,” Jiang Nanxuan muttered, his white hand gently stroking his previous body. A strange feeling stirred within him.

“My memories are only partial. If I truly merge with this body, my memories will awaken completely. Then I won’t be Jiang Nanxuan anymore!” Jiang Nanxuan’s eyes hardened, gazing at the Sovereign body. He waved his hand, retrieving it into his storage bag.

At the same time, Jiang Nanxuan released array banners around people—another eight hundred and ten banners forming a storm, surrounding the thousand feet area.

“Pup…” Jiang Nanxuan spat blood onto the main banner, then slammed it into the ground.

“Array open!” Jiang Nanxuan roared, blinding light making people squint.

“Wum…” The array banners emitted waves of energy, a golden barrier rising a thousand feet high, covering Jiang Nanxuan’s group.

“Everyone into the array!” Jiang Nanxuan ordered the Tianyuan Continent geniuses in the sky. His voice carried an authoritative tone.

Hearing Jiang Nanxuan’s words, people smiled, flying into the array.

Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei sighed deeply. Their bodies were battered; a level gap was too great. Even combined, they barely held off. Time would bring defeat.

Others weren’t much better; their defeat was just a matter of time. Seeing Jiang Nanxuan’s array, they smiled and flew in.

“Want to escape?” The black-cloaked youths sneered, watching the other regional geniuses enter. Their purple energy surged, intensifying attacks.

“If I wanted to leave, could you stop me?” Ying Hongtu sneered, his speed making him lightning as he entered the array.

“Go…” Gu Qianxue’s sword qi surged, slicing through as she and Gu Lei entered the array.

“Enter the array first!” Ji Chen and Lei Yong brothers unleashed their martial arts, returning to Gu Qianxue’s side.

Others also used their techniques, rushing into the array. Yet some were struck by the black-cloaked youths, injured or killed outside.

“Wum…” When the last genius entered the array, Jiang Nanxuan roared, releasing another banner. The array slowly closed.

“Damn!” The black-cloaked youths glared, their faces grim.

“Ninth-grade array?” The lead youth frowned, gazing at the barrier. It was a challenge.

Ninth-grade arrays were hard to break for them. A regular soul-accumulation stage master couldn’t crack it.

“Think you can escape just because you’re in the array?” The youth sneered, mocking the group inside.

At that moment, most within the array were injured, their faces pale. The gap between soul-accumulation and spirit-summoning was too vast. These ten soul-accumulation masters had held on well, but seeing over a thousand corpses made Gu Qianxue’s group feel pain. These were people who gathered due to Luo Tian and their connection, avoiding the brutal fight for the Ancient Relic Seal. Yet they couldn’t escape death.

“Hmph…” The youths gazed at the group inside, their faces cold. Their hands moved swiftly, strange waves emanating from them—yet the group felt oppression.

“Wum…” The waves spread, blood qi rising from the ground and surrounding the youths.

“This blood qi is from those who died fighting for the Ancient Relic Seal and those killed just now!” Meng Yao’s face turned serious, watching the growing blood qi.

Jiang Nanxuan’s gaze was also grim, a bad feeling rising: “Trouble is coming.”

The youths’ blood qi grew stronger. Two thousand souls had died in the fight for the Ancient Relic Seal, and others were either gone or merged with Gu Qianxue’s group. Now, two to three thousand spirit-summoning and soul-accumulation masters’ blood qi were drained by the youths. The power was enough to shock anyone.

The sky turned bloody, red light casting an eerie glow.

“Beasts!” The group inside glared at the youths’ calm faces, cursing them.

Everyone had death, but these methods were cruel—no mercy for the dead.

“Tianshi Sect!” People realized the youths’ identity, recalling only Tianshi Sect could refine such blood qi.

Other evil sects could do it too, but they only targeted ordinary people secretly.

As people discussed, the youths completed their blood qi extraction. Two to three thousand souls’ blood qi surrounded them, hiding their forms.

“Think you alone can use arrays?” The lead youth sneered from the blood qi, then countless red banners emerged, planted into the ground.

“Killing Array! Open!” The cold voice echoed through the blood qi, making some spirit-summoning stage geniuses shiver.

Chapter 675: Leave It to Me ()

Chapter 675: Leave It to Me

As the cold voice faded, the blood qi surged violently. Countless banners emitted powerful waves.

“One… ten…” Blood dragons formed from the banners, growling as they flew toward Jiang Nanxuan’s array.

“Boom…” The blood dragons slammed into the array, thunderous sounds shaking its members.

“Pang…” Jiang Nanxuan’s array, a ninth-grade one, only trembled slightly. The blood dragons dissolved into blood, coating the array.

The blood dragons reformed under the banners’ power, charging again.

Jiang Nanxuan furrowed his brows, his face grim. Though the array showed no change, the enemy’s array was clearly not ordinary. Plus, ten soul-accumulation stage geniuses hadn’t attacked yet—this worried him.

“Not bad for a ninth-grade array! Our Killing Array is eighth-grade, yet it can’t harm it!” The youths smiled, standing in the blood qi.

“Go! My children!” The lead youth smiled, waving his hand. Black bugs emerged from his body, buzzing toward Jiang Nanxuan’s array.

Seeing this, others smiled too, releasing colorful bugs toward the array.

“This…” The group inside gaped, looking at Jiang Nanxuan. Each of his methods was shocking; they feared whether his array could hold.

The bugs enveloped the array, their tiny forms biting it. Uncomfortable sounds echoed.

“The array is weakening!” Jiang Nanxuan’s face was grim. As the array master, he knew it best. Though slight, it escaped his perception.

“Must I merge with the body?” Jiang Nanxuan’s face bore bitterness.

“What’s wrong?” Meng Yao sensed his unease, her face puzzled.

“Nothing,” Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, but his gaze was on Luo Tian’s group. He sighed inwardly: “Come out sooner, or I’ll have to merge!”
