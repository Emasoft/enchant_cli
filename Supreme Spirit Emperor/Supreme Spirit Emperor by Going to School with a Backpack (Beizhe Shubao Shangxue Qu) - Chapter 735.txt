This was only the beginning; others were also on the verge of collapse.

"Kill!" Just as Yan Chen and the others were about to give in, a chorus of battle cries erupted from the rear of the Celestial Alliance.

Millions of figures appeared, mostly women, yet their auras were formidable. A woman stood atop the sky, appearing on the battlefield in an instant, wielding a Dao sword with overwhelming momentum.

"It's Yaochi!" Everyone gasped, surprised that Tianyuan Sect had received reinforcements at this moment.

"Lin Yao, are you also against me?" Seeing the woman, Eternal Life Immortal King's face darkened.

"I will not allow you to massacre the people of Pangu Mountain, so I have come!" The woman spoke coldly, her Dao sword slashing repeatedly to block an Immortal King peak, giving Lu Chong and Meng Wushuang a moment's respite to regroup and assist Nan Gong Yuqing.

"Pangu Immortal King is already dead. Do you still cling to that old man?" Eternal Life Immortal King's voice grew colder.

Eternal Life Immortal King had no children, pursuing the path of eternal life. Yet few knew he once loved someone—Yaochi's peak Immortal Lin Yao. Thus, Eternal Life Immortal King had never harmed Yaochi.

"Since you insist, I shall personally destroy you. Sever my emotional root and leave me no weakness!" Eternal Life Immortal King spoke, finally deciding to fight personally.

The world trembled; the heavens roared. Eternal Life Immortal King took a step, and the entire battlefield shuddered. A heavy pressure descended from the sky.

"Eternal Life Immortal King, if you wish to destroy Tianyuan Sect, ask me first!" Just as Eternal Life Immortal King took his step, a thunderous roar echoed through the heavens. Several figures flew from the horizon, unaffected by Eternal Life Immortal King's aura.

Rip... A lightning bolt rose, carrying supreme heavenly might. It transformed into a resplendent sword beam, slashing toward Eternal Life Immortal King.

A man and a woman. The leader was an old man, clad in gray robes, holding a thunder sword with wings etched onto his robe.

"Sky Dao Thunder Sword!"

"Sky Dao Mountain! Sky Dao Sect!" The three of Yiyao and Long Jie, along with Chen Zhanbiao, who were battling the Medicine King Sect's three elders, gasped upon seeing the old man.

Sky Dao Mountain—long vanished from the celestial realm and presumed extinct—had reappeared today.

Behind the old man stood three middle-aged men, also in Sky Dao Mountain attire. Most striking was the woman. She closed her eyes, clad in seven-color silk, her figure enchanting and captivating. Though her eyes were closed, she was an unparalleled beauty. Simply standing there, she exuded a mesmerizing allure.

"I don't care about this matter; I only owe Lu Tian a favor!" The woman's cold voice echoed, as if ignoring the blood-soaked battlefield below. Her presence chilled all who heard her.

"Zhang Daotian?"

"Unexpectedly, you're still alive..." Eternal Life Immortal King's face showed a faint smile as he gazed at Zhang Daotian.

"Zhang Daotian, disciple of the Fallen Heaven Immortal King. That brilliant youth!" As Eternal Life Immortal King spoke, seasoned warriors recalled the image of that youthful prodigy. At that time, Fallen Heaven Immortal King had not yet perished; Sky Dao Mountain was still one of the nine immortal mountains. That figure had dominated all, leaving the other nine's prodigies humiliated.

Unfortunately, Fallen Heaven Immortal King had perished. Sky Dao Mountain was annihilated overnight by Eternal Life Immortal King, and Zhang Daotian vanished.

"Zhang Daotian!" In Tianyuan Sect, Jiang Yuexiong stood among the crowd, his face alight with excitement. Zhang Daotian's strength was unmatched; most famous was his elixir art. He and Zhang Daotian were friends, a regret for Jiang Yuexiong.

"Immortal King peak? What good is that?" Eternal Life Immortal King sneered, taking a step and instantly appearing beside Zhang Daotian. He raised his hand to grasp Zhang Daotian.

"Though you are an Immortal King peak, we differ!" Zhang Daotian roared. Seeing Eternal Life Immortal King, his eyes turned red. His Sky Dao Thunder Sword surged with a resplendent sword beam that roared through the heavens.

This strike carried Zhang Daotian's years of hatred and resentment, its power overwhelming. Thunder Sword, reaching the heavens, green hands pressed down on all directions. In an instant, a deafening collision echoed through the heavens.

The sky shattered; the thunder sword was obliterated beneath the heavens. A violent surge of energy struck Eternal Life Immortal King and Zhang Daotian, sending Zhang Daotian flying tens of thousands of feet. His face was pale.

"Hmph?" Eternal Life Immortal King furrowed his brow, a slight wound on his hand. This was enough to astonish him.

Chapter 2798: Repaying a Favor()

"Did you cultivate your own spiritual energy?" Eternal Life Immortal King's eyes narrowed. As a near-Imperial Sovereign, his discernment was unmatched. In one clash, he had already sensed Zhang Daotian's uniqueness.

"A regular peak Immortal King would not be your match. But you face me. I could destroy you once, and I can do it again!" Eternal Life Immortal King sneered, taking another step forward to strike.

"Sky Dao Thunder Sword!" Zhang Daotian's white hair flew as he charged forward, undeterred by the overwhelming attack. Another resplendent sword beam rose, clashing with Eternal Life Immortal King's crushing hand.

"Water and Sky as One!" Yaochi's Holy Mother Lin Yao wielded her Dao sword, unleashing an immense divine power that transformed into a supreme blade to strike Eternal Life Immortal King.

Eternal Life Immortal King remained calm, his hands weaving the myriad Dao laws. Facing two of the celestial realm's peak immortals, he held his ground, overpowering them each clash sending Zhang Daotian and Lin Yao into coughing blood. A near-Imperial Sovereign was too strong; any peak Immortal King would be crushed. That Zhang Daotian and Lin Yao could withstand was already a miracle.

That unparalleled woman stood in the sky, her eyes closed. A fool dared to attack her. An Immortal King beginner rushed toward her, his face greedy as he licked his lips and reached for her.

"Die..." Before the Immortal King beginner could act, he felt a crushing force from all directions. His body instantly turned to blood mist.

"She!" As the woman struck, Eternal Life Immortal King's expression darkened. He had sensed her uniqueness from that surge.

"Send two to capture her!" Eternal Life Immortal King barked, dispatching two peak Immortal Kings toward the woman to test her strength.

The two peak Immortal Kings leapt into the air, but their hearts trembled. This blindfolded woman exuded an eerie aura. Her effortless destruction of the Immortal King beginner made her even more ominous.

"Kill!" The two cried, trying to steel their courage as they approached within a hundred feet. Yet their bodies halted.

The two peak Immortal Kings, faces filled with terror, gazed at the blindfolded woman. They felt as if bound by two cold ropes.

With a single hand, she extended her white palm and grasped at the void. The two peak Immortal Kings screamed before turning into two blood mists.

Sigh... Everyone gasped, staring at the woman who stood there with icy aura. Peak Immortal Kings were like ants before her.

"Near-Imperial Sovereign!" Eternal Life Immortal King's eyes also showed disbelief as he gazed at the woman.

"What is this? Another near-Imperial Sovereign? The world has changed so much! In such a short time, how many near-Imperial Sovereigns have appeared!" Everyone was stunned.

"Good, good, good!" Eternal Life Immortal King laughed, his gaze on the woman like a predator's. His eyes showed greed.

"Your gaze is very annoying!" The woman spoke coldly, still standing there without striking.

"No more games!" Eternal Life Immortal King roared. His hands wove, a green door emerging from the void with supreme pressure, crushing toward Zhang Daotian and Lin Yao.

World Treasure, wielded by a near-Imperial Sovereign, radiated destruction and heaven-shattering energy. Under this pressure, Zhang Daotian and Lin Yao struggled to breathe, even losing the will to resist.

"I refuse to accept this!" Zhang Daotian roared. His aura surged violently, with a crackling sound from his body.

Lin Yao's Dao sword also radiated resplendent divine light, scattering divine brilliance to cut through heaven and earth. A single strike.

Everyone could see Zhang Daotian and Lin Yao had fought with all their might. Yet even in their desperation, under the overwhelming green door's power, they were insignificant.

Boom... The heavens roared. Eternal Life Door's infinite might clashed with Zhang Daotian and Lin Yao's sword beams, shattering both resplendent beams. Yet the formidable Eternal Life Door did not stop, pressing down on Zhang Daotian and Lin Yao.

They were crushed to the ground, spitting blood, their bodies riddled with cracks.

"Finished!" Eternal Life Immortal King spoke softly. His hand struck toward Zhang Daotian and Lin Yao, who would surely die if hit.

His hand obscured the sky, like a green mountain, radiating overwhelming energy. It pressed down.

Ten thousand feet... A thousand feet...

In an instant, the green hand descended upon Zhang Daotian and Lin Yao's heads. Zhang Daotian's face showed bitterness.

"Ultimately, we failed!" Zhang Daotian's eyes were crimson, but his face bore bitterness. Crushed by the Eternal Life Door, he could not even rise.

Yet as the green hand was about to crush Zhang Daotian and Lin Yao, an invisible wave spread over it. The once intimidating hand roared before instantly turning to stone.

"This is repaying Lu Tian's second favor!" The woman spoke coldly, finally opening her closed eyes. Her gaze was mesmerizing.

Boom... The stone mountain hand roared, turning to dust and shattering over Zhang Daotian and Lin Yao's heads.

Black snakes coiled around them, enveloping the surrounding Celestial Alliance forces and driving them back into Tianyuan Sect's domain. Seeing Zhang Daotian and Lin Yao rescued, Tianyuan Sect members sighed in relief. Everyone knew Zhang Daotian was crucial to Lu Tian; if he were harmed, it would be a devastating blow.

"Near-Imperial Sovereign! If I consumed you, would I enter the Imperial Sovereign realm?" Eternal Life Immortal King licked his lips. His hand had turned to stone, but after a shake, it gradually returned to normal.

"Too beautiful!" As the Snake Emperor opened his eyes, those who gazed at him were stunned. Their final thought was to turn into stone.

"Your gaze is very annoying. This favor, Lu Tian doesn't need to repay; I give it as a gift!" Medusa spoke softly. Her hand shimmered with a hum, and a fang-like long sword appeared in her grasp.

"Eternal Life Door!" Eternal Life Immortal King roared. His palm's green door flew from his hand, summoned by him to crush the Snake Emperor.

Chapter 2800: Obstruction()

A precise lightning strike hit Eternal Life Immortal King, instantly exploding. Lu Tian felt a powerful impact on his body, sending him flying backward.

The stars shattered; each star was destroyed. Within a few million miles of Eternal Life Immortal King, the area turned into void, forming a massive black hole that continuously absorbed the shattered stars.

Lu Tian spat blood, standing with Medusa. Eternal Life Immortal King's figure had vanished.

The violent energy lasted half an hour before finally calming. Lu Tian found no trace of Eternal Life Immortal King.

"Did he die or not?" Lu Tian's eyes were deep. If Eternal Life Immortal King still lived, he was truly helpless.

"Unless he has some miraculous treasure, he must be dead!" Medusa's cold voice echoed. Her gaze at Lu Tian showed caution.

Lu Tian looked at Medusa, his body slightly stiffened. His blood surged, dispelling the stiffness.

"Terrifying!" Lu Tian was a near-Imperial Sovereign but still felt uneasy under Medusa's gaze. He turned his eyes elsewhere.

"Let's go back!" Lu Tian spoke, leaping into the stars and flying toward the celestial realm.

Their return was swift. Within a day, they found Tianyuan Sect's direction and tore through space to appear above it.

Tianyuan Sect's battle continued. Both sides had lost nearly ten million people, both exhausted. Only peak Immortals fought.

As Lu Tian and Medusa appeared, the battlefield paused. Lu Tian released his aura, halting all combat.

"Defeated! Eternal Life Immortal King has fallen!" People stared at Lu Tian standing in the sky.

Hun Wang, Gui Wang, and Yao Wang ceased fighting. Their figures flickered back to their formations, gazing at Lu Tian.

"Kill!" Lu Tian extended his hand. The void trembled. The three peak Immortal Kings of Eternal Life Mountain felt an immediate life-threatening crisis.

"Ah..." They cried, disbelieving Eternal Life Immortal King's defeat. They knew the consequences of his fall.

But the situation was Lu Tian had returned, and Eternal Life Immortal King hadn't.

They cried out, feeling three massive hands gripping them, pulling them toward Lu Tian.

"Die!" Lu Tian would not forgive them. He shot three spears, piercing their foreheads and destroying their souls.

Defeat followed the deaths of the three peak Immortal Kings. The Celestial Alliance collapsed, slaughtered by Tianyuan Sect, Yaochi, and Pangu Mountain.

"Lu Tian, we submit!" Hun Wang, Gui Wang, and Yao Wang cried out. In the end, Tianyuan Sect prevailed, and Lu Tian laughed triumphantly.

"None needed!" Lu Tian sneered. He took a step forward, his foot descending upon them with a thunderous roar.

The collision echoed. His foot pressed down, overwhelming pressure making their faces pale. Yet they couldn't watch themselves die. They raised World Treasures to meet Lu Tian's attack.

Boom...

Lu Tian's foot shattered, and the three were crushed to the ground, their mouths spewing blood like it was free.

"Again this feeling!" Their lips twisted in bitterness. The situation mirrored when Eternal Life Immortal King had crushed them, leaving no resistance.

"Die!" Lu Tian spoke coldly. He raised his hand to strike them. Even with World Treasures, they would be killed.

"Om mani padme hum..." Just as Lu Tian's hand was about to strike them, a Buddhist chant echoed. A golden hand appeared across the heavens, colliding with Lu Tian's strike and neutralizing his attack.

"Su Mi Shan!" Lu Tian's eyes narrowed. He gazed at the Buddha and the Fighting Saint approaching.

"Master Yao Huang Tian!" Lu Tian bowed to Yao Huang Tian, but everyone could sense his anger.

Most of Tianyuan Sect's people were from the Nine Domains, but when their sect was about to be destroyed, Yao Huang Tian had never appeared.

"Master Lu, do not continue this internal strife. A great calamity is approaching. If we continue to waste energy, it will only plunge the celestial realm into chaos. Please grant this old monk a favor and let go of these three!" The old monk spoke, his voice calm.

"I have a connection with Su Mi Shan's people. But it doesn't mean you can interfere in my affairs. The celestial realm's exhaustion? When they surrounded Tianyuan Sect, where were you?" Lu Tian sneered. He didn't believe in Buddhism and was ruthless. He knew only that killing repaid debts.

"Don't kill them, I would betray the hundreds of millions who died in Tianyuan Sect!" Lu Tian flipped his hand, three-color lightning surged and struck the three peak Immortals.

"Master Lu, don't be stubborn. I do this for all beings..." The old monk showed no concern but raised a light shield, enveloping Gui Wang and the others.

"I don't want to be your enemy. But if you block me, I'll deal with you too!" Lu Tian sneered. Three-color lightning hovered in his hand, merging.

"Ten Thousand Miles of Tianyuan Sect!" Lu Tian roared. His voice echoed across the battlefield.

"Yes!" Tianyuan Sect members spoke loudly, their voices filled with excitement. Today, they had finally lifted their heads high!

Crash... In an instant, Tianyuan Sect's quality was revealed. Countless figures retreated without panic, heading toward Pangu City.

The palm lightning formed. Terrifying energy spread again. Lu Tian gazed at the old monk, waiting for Tianyuan Sect to retreat. Once they were far enough, he would unleash it.

"I want to see how you'll protect them. If you can withstand it, I'll let them go!" Lu Tian spoke coldly.

"Master Lu, are you serious?" Hearing Lu Tian's words, the old monk gazed at him.

"Indeed. I always keep my word!" Lu Tian replied, watching Tianyuan Sect and Pangu Mountain's forces retreat.

"Lu Tian, stop! Let's talk!" Yao Huang Tian finally couldn't bear it. He had seen Lu Tian's resentment toward him.

"Master, I respect you, but this matter, please don't interfere!" Lu Tian replied, gazing at Yao Huang Tian.

"Don't say more. I'll take it on!" The Buddha smiled lightly, his body radiating golden light as he appeared above Gui Wang's group.

"Alas, you really want to do this?" Yao Huang Tian gazed at the Buddha deeply. Lu Tian felt some suspicion, sensing the Buddha's actions had hidden intentions.

"Lu Tian, you'll regret this!" Yao Huang Tian roared again, trying to stop Lu Tian. But he understood Lu Tian's nature.

Chapter 2801: For the Sake of All Beings()

"Regret?" Lu Tian's brows furrowed, more puzzled. He still trusted Yao Huang Tian, but when he saw the corpses piled up on Mount Tianyuan, his eyes turned colder.

"Sorry. Even with reasons, I must give an account to the people who died in Tianyuan Sect!" Lu Tian spoke. He watched as Tianyuan Sect, Pangu Mountain, and Yaochi had retreated ten thousand miles. He flipped his hand, palm lightning erupted, striking Gui Wang and the others.

"Om mani padme hum..." The Buddha's hands clasped, his body radiating divine laws. He recited sutras above Gui Wang and the others.

"Invincible Diamond?" Lu Tian sneered. He had seen this martial art before. Though it was miraculous, almost no one could harm the practitioner. But Lu Tian had confidence in palm lightning.

In an instant, twisted space accompanied a thunderous sound. It struck the Buddha's body. The entire world seemed to freeze, then a deafening explosion echoed through the heavens. Those who had retreated ten thousand miles felt their ears go deaf, a resplendent light column rising from Tianyuan Sect's direction, piercing through the heavens.

Apocalyptic. The sky began to collapse continuously; the earth sank repeatedly. The entire world trembled violently.

Another half-hour passed, and the energy calmed. Lu Tian and Medusa stood there, gazing at the Buddha's direction.

"Nam Myoho Renge Kyo..." The mantra echoed. The Fighting Saint stood in the dust, his hands clasped, reciting continuously.

"Relic!" Lu Tian's eyes narrowed. He naturally understood what the relic's appearance meant.

"Buddha Shakyamuni!"

"From now on, I, Yao Huang Tian, will recite the Buddha!" The Fighting Saint's body radiated golden light. His aura changed.

"Master Lu, please keep your promise. I'll give Master Lu a great gift before leaving. Please accept it; it may help Master Lu's cultivation progress!" A gentle voice echoed. A golden shadow appeared, addressing Lu Tian.

Lu Tian was stunned, unsure of what happened. His palm lightning was powerful, but the Buddha's use of Invincible Diamond had prepared for it. Perhaps he could be wounded, but not killed.

Lu Tian was stunned. The golden relic transformed into a stream of light, rushing toward Lu Tian's front and plunging into his dantian.

Boom...

A violent surge of cultivation energy instantly flooded Lu Tian's dantian. The imperial seal within his dantian began to solidify rapidly.

"This..." Lu Tian was stunned. He didn't understand what happened. This gift was too great, leaving him unable to believe.

"Lu Tian, refine it!"

"Don't disappoint the Buddha's sincere efforts!" The Fighting Saint gazed at Lu Tian, sighing softly.

"What sincere effort?" Lu Tian was completely confused. He felt he had made a mistake, but the澎湃 power in his dantian prevented him from speaking. If he didn't process it, he felt he would burst.

"First refine it. I'll explain later!" Yao Huang Tian spoke, standing beside Lu Tian to guard him.

Yan Chen, Chen Zhanbiao, and Long Jie also arrived at Lu Tian's side, waiting for him to complete the refinement.

Jiang Nanxuan then began instructing Tianyuan Sect members to enter the Middle Heavens. After all, no faction in the celestial realm could now rival Tianyuan Sect.

Unification of the Celestial Realm! These four words spread throughout the celestial realm, causing a stir. No one expected such an outcome.

The era of the Nine Immortal Mountains ended, and Tianyuan Sect changed the celestial realm's balance with its might.

Lu Tian, a near-Imperial Sovereign, was now the most powerful in the celestial realm. Eternal Life Immortal King's fate was unknown, likely dead. Su Mi Shan Buddha had perished, becoming a relic absorbed by Lu Tian.

That day, the bells of Su Mi Shan rang continuously. Monks recited sutras endlessly, their chants echoing.

"Su Mi Shan has emerged!" Another news spread. Su Mi Shan's new Buddha announced it would no longer ignore worldly affairs, honoring the previous Buddha's will to enter the world.

Now only six mountains remained: Yaochi, Pangu Mountain, Duanhun Mountain, Gui Wang Mountain, and Yao Wang Mountain.

Sky Dao Sect revived. Peak Immortal King Zhang Daotian returned, directly driving out the forces that had occupied Sky Dao Sect in the Middle Heavens.

Tianyuan Sect occupied Donghuang Mountain, becoming its new base. But the Middle Heavens still belonged to Tianyuan Sect. The Middle Heavens and Upper Heavens began to interconnect, with the Middle Heavens' commerce rising dramatically across the nine heavens.

Lu Tian was unaware of these matters. For half a month, he sat in meditation at the former Tianyuan Sect location, refining the relic.

The roaring sound continued within his dantian. His aura gradually stabilized.

Sigh... On the sixteenth day, Lu Tian opened his eyes, filled with admiration. A relic of a near-Imperial Sovereign had greatly enhanced his cultivation. The imperial seal's image in his dantian was more solid, yet still not fully formed.

"Master, what did the Buddha mean?" Lu Tian asked, gazing at Yao Huang Tian.

"He did it for all beings. He had previously injured himself while striving toward near-Imperial Sovereign status. Though wounded, with his strength, he could have lived for thousands of years!"

"But he didn't. He knew the great calamity was approaching, so he sacrificed himself to calm your hatred. Moreover, he transformed his cultivation into a relic and gave it to you to enhance your strength!" Yao Huang Tian spoke, his voice heavy with reverence.

Lu Tian and the others were stunned. They couldn't believe such an altruistic person existed. A near-Imperial Sovereign had sacrificed himself for all beings, the so-called great calamity.

Respect filled Lu Tian's heart. He felt regretful; such a powerful being had died at his hands.

"Forgive me!" Lu Tian whispered, clenching his fists. His fists glowed with golden light.

"This was his decision. Don't worry, no one from Su Mi Shan will resent you!" Yao Huang Tian spoke again.

As they conversed, three streams of light shattered the heavens. They appeared in Lu Tian's group's view.

Chapter 2802: Becoming an Emperor()

Beneath the heavens, three battered figures flew toward Lu Tian. Their auras were weak, as if they could fall from the sky at any moment.

"Da Niu, Er Niu." Lu Tian's eyes narrowed. He leapt forward and stabilized the three swaying figures.

"Big Brother..." The three were bloodied. They were Da Niu, Er Niu, and the Two Kings of Death.

"What happened?" Lu Tian asked. He had planned to go to Hell, but Da Niu and Er Niu had returned with the Two Kings of Death.

"Hell is completely destroyed!" The Two Kings of Death spoke, their voices filled with bitterness.

"Tell me slowly. What happened?" Lu Tian's hands emitted divine light, enveloping the three and helping them recover slightly.

"Lu Shengmen destroyed the Wheel Turning Palace. Only I and Er Niu escaped with the palace master!" Da Niu spoke, causing Lu Tian's eyes to widen in disbelief.

"What?" Yan Chen and Long Jie also gasped.

They could clearly sense the auras of Da Niu, Er Niu, and even the Two Kings of Death. Their power was formidable, reaching near-Imperial Sovereign status. Yet they were so battered, fleeing.

"A king appeared in Lu Shengmen!" The Two Kings of Death spoke, their voices filled with bitterness. Their words made Lu Tian and the others stiffen like struck by lightning.

"How is that possible? The world's rules don't allow for kings!" Lu Tian questioned. He didn't need to guess who the king was—Yan Huanyu.

If a king descended into the celestial realm, the entire realm would tremble. No one could resist.

"But we sensed his aura was unstable. He must have entered through special means; otherwise, we three wouldn't have escaped!"

"Unfortunately, nearly ten million people in the Wheel Turning Palace were all destroyed. Except for me, no one survived!" The Two Kings of Death mourned.

Boom... Hearing the Two Kings of Death's words, Lu Tian's mind thundered. His eyes became dizzy, recalling his time in the Wheel Turning Palace.

"Master, did Fire Lord and others die?" Lu Tian asked. His heart pounded violently, blood flowing uncontrollably from his mouth.

"Yes, they all died. Now hell has been occupied!" The Two Kings of Death nodded. If not for the Rebirth Pill, he wouldn't have survived to reach Da Niu and Er Niu.

Crack... Lu Tian clenched his fists. His eyes turned wild, forcing back the urge to rush to hell.

"This grudge must be avenged!" Lu Tian roared, howling at the sky. The heavens trembled.

"First return to Tianyuan Sect!" But Lu Tian knew now wasn't the time for revenge. Not only that, he had to stop Yan Huanyu from attacking the celestial realm with Lu Shengmen.

The group's figures flickered, disappearing into the sky. Within three hours, they appeared above Tianyuan Sect.

At this moment, the Grand Hall of Tianyuan Sect was heavy. Even Hun Wang, Gui Wang, and Yao Wang were present. In short, the most powerful individuals in the celestial realm had gathered here for one news: Hell's Lu Shengmen had overrun the Ten Judges of Yama, seizing control of hell.

"We are strong. Lu Tian has become a near-Imperial Sovereign, and there's also the Snake Emperor. Together, they can withstand it!" Diao Dede spoke, gazing at others.

"But it's not as simple as you think. The Snake Emperor previously acted out of a favor to Lu Tian. Now, getting her to act is no longer simple!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly, his voice filled with helplessness. Since defeating Eternal Life Immortal King, the Snake Emperor had left and returned to Buzhao Mountain.

"Let's just fight. Without a king, we have hope. Lu Tian's old man can fight well!" Sun Ke Nian sneered.

"But Yan Huanyu has become a king!" As Sun Ke Nian's words ended, Lu Tian and the others entered the hall, addressing everyone.

Lu Tian's words made the hall instantly silent. Everyone was stunned, their eyes filled with disbelief.

"King!" How could it be? Neither the celestial realm nor hell had seen a king in years!

Hun Wang, Gui Wang, and Yao Wang gasped. Among the people present, they had lived the longest in the celestial realm. The Nine Immortal Mountains' ancient traditions knew some secrets. This world could not have a king.

"But he is a king. He wounded three near-Imperial Sovereigns. What do you think his strength is?" Lu Tian sighed. He didn't believe it, but the facts forced him to accept.

"What do we do now?"

"This is really a disaster. Yan Huanyu, that kid isn't good news. He almost sacrificed the entire continent back in Tianyuan Continent!" Zheng Xin and Gu Lei spoke.

"Among us, the most likely to become a king is Lu Tian!" Jie Du monk spoke. Accurately, it should be the current Buddha of Su Mi Shan.

All eyes turned to Lu Tian. This was their last hope. But Lu Tian shook his head. Though he had absorbed the Buddha's relic, he was closer to becoming an emperor but couldn't enter it in a short time. Moreover, even if there was a way, the world's rules would suppress him.

"What do we do now?" Seeing Lu Tian shake his head, the hall grew heavy again.

"One month later, I'll lead hell's army to attack the celestial realm. Are you ready?" Just as everyone was silent, a voice echoed through the nine heavens. The sound spread throughout the celestial realm.

"Who!"

"My god, it's terrifying. How could someone's voice spread across the entire celestial realm? What power must they have?" The celestial realm was in chaos, feeling this voice's owner must be a supreme being. Their impression had no one capable of such a feat.

"Another war?" After hearing the voice's meaning, people realized hell was about to clash with the celestial realm.

Two forces had unified, disrupting balance. This time, it would depend on who could destroy the other. Whoever won would be the world's ruler.

Lu Tian and his group felt a chill, surprised at how fast it came. Only one month until the battle.

"I have an idea!" Just as the hall was silent and people pondered how to resist a king, the returned Two Kings of Death spoke. Their attention turned to them.

Chapter 2803: The Plan()

"A single relic might not be enough, but if we add us all..."

"Let's perform the Dao Heart Seed Demon technique. Absorb our cultivation into yours. It should allow you to enter the Emperor realm!" The Two Kings of Death spoke, making the hall's people slightly stunned.

"Impossible!"

"The Dao Heart Seed Demon technique is miraculous, but it depends on who. A near-Imperial Sovereign has surpassed the Immortal King realm significantly. There's a high chance of failure, which would be counterproductive!" Lu Tian shook his head. He truly had no confidence. Moreover, who could easily give up their cultivation? Lu Tian couldn't bring himself to do it.

"Don't be polite. If we don't do this, we'll all perish. This is the only way. I've fought Yan Huanyu before and know his strength!" The Two Kings of Death shouted, gazing at Lu Tian.

"Yes, Big Brother. That guy is too strong. Even if we four joined forces, we couldn't match him. If he stabilizes completely, we'll have no chance. We don't have much time left!" Da Niu and Er Niu also spoke, willing to sacrifice for Lu Tian.

"Impossible..."

"Let's think of another way first!" Lu Tian kept shaking his head. No matter how much the Two Kings of Death and Da Niu and Er Niu persuaded, he refused. A Buddha had already made him regretful enough. Now, he couldn't bring himself to let the Two Kings of Death and Da Niu and Er Niu sacrifice. He truly couldn't.

"Don't argue. Perhaps there's another way!" Just as the four argued, Jiang Yuexiong spoke, drawing everyone's attention to him.
