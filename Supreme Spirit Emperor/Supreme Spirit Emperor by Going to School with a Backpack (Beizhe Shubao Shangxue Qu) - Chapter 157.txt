“Though I do not know your purpose for vying over me, if I do not make full use of this opportunity, it would be a betrayal of your high regard for me!” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly, his gaze teasing as he looked at Jiang Sxi.

“You!” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Jiang Sxi’s eyebrows furrowed in anger, her face contorted with fury, her chest rising and falling violently.

“What’s wrong with me? For so long as your attendant, have you not yet repaid me?” Luo Tian spoke without the slightest fear, countering.

“Very well, I accept!” Sha Cangmang, the Grandmaster of the Sect, nodded slightly. He extended his hand and a golden headband flew from it, transforming into a radiant beam of gold that descended slowly from the sky.

“I don’t want it!” Jiang Sxi roared, her three-source immortal aura surging skyward, her voice brimming with endless fury and resentment.

Yet Jiang Sxi’s power was nothing compared to whom? Though she might be stronger than Luo Tian and his companions, before an eight-source immortal like Sha Cangmang, she was but a child.

The golden Binding Spirit Band seemed slow, yet in an instant it reached Jiang Sxi’s head. No matter how she struggled, her perfect form could only stand motionless, helplessly watching the band encircle her head.

“Elder Second, Elder Third, adjust this boy’s Binding Spirit Band. From now on, only I can control it!” Sha Cangmang commanded the four seven-source immortals behind him.

“Understood!” Upon hearing Sha Cangmang’s words, the four seven-source immortals nodded. Their hands moved swiftly, and一道道 seals flew from their palms, circling around Luo Tian’s head before plunging into the Binding Spirit Band.

“Young man, don’t regret it!” Jin Yongsi, the Grandmaster of the White Tiger Sect, saw Luo Tian had agreed to Sha Cangmang’s proposal. His face darkened instantly, turning cold.

“What is there to regret? I have never regretted a single decision!” Luo Tian smiled faintly, speaking softly.

“We’re leaving! Sha Cangmang, I advise you to keep a close eye on this boy. During the Sacred Domain Ranking Battle, ensure he doesn’t appear; otherwise, not only do I not wish for him to live, but Zhuque and Xuanwu Sects’ two masters would also not want to see him exist!” Jin Yongsi’s face bore a faint smile as he addressed Sha Cangmang.

“Don’t bother worrying. My disciple, I have my own plans,” Sha Cangmang’s voice was like a frigid wind from the abyss, cold and biting, sweeping through people’s hearts.

Seeing Sha Cangmang’s attitude, Jin Yongsi knew he could not resolve this matter today. He let out a cold snort and, accompanied by his strength, tore through the void, vanishing from the sight of Qinglong Sect’s disciples.

With Jin Yongsi gone, people looked at Luo Tian with complex expressions. Today’s events were utterly unbelievable.

Luo Tian had been merely an attendant before, but now he had become the Grandmaster’s direct disciple. His status was terrifyingly high.

Everyone in the Four Sacred Star Domains knew that the four major powers were Qinglong Immortal Sha Cangmang, Baihu Immortal Jin Yongsi, Zhuque Immortal Ke Zhen Tian, and Xuanwu Immortal Chen Xuanning. The Grandmaster of Qinglong Sect was the top among these four titans, his power boundless. Becoming a disciple of Qinglong Immortal was an unparalleled blessing for all in the Four Sacred Star Domains. Even Jiang Sxi had once desired to enter Sha Cangmang’s sect but was rejected.

Now Luo Tian had become Sha Cangmang’s direct disciple, placing him second to none within Qinglong Sect.

“You three, come out!” Luo Tian knew his status was unparalleled. He pointed at the three one-source immortals who had once captured him, a smile on his face.

Upon hearing Luo Tian’s call, the three men paled. Though they were elders, their status among the elders was low; otherwise, they would not have been dispatched outside to assist Qinglong Sect’s disciples in capturing attendants.

They had previously consumed the pills Jiang Sxi gave them, ascending to two-source immortals. Yet they had just witnessed Luo Tian killing Sun Shaohui, and now Luo Tian’s status was so high. They recalled the strength he had shown when capturing them.

“Come on, from now on, follow me!” Luo Tian smiled, drawing upon his experience as a second-generation lord in the Xian Gu continent. He quickly adapted to his new identity as the Grandmaster’s direct disciple.

Chapter 757: Vast Resources

Chapter 757: Vast Resources

“You three, from now on, follow me. I’ll ensure you eat well and drink well. Haven’t you seen the first genius of this sect bowing to my authority?” Luo Tian’s eyes flicked with pride as he looked at the three men who emerged trembling.

“Yes, yes!” The three men inwardly cursed Luo Tian for his audacity but maintained respectful expressions, nodding repeatedly.

Jiang Sxi’s face was dark with fury. She stood there, her gaze icy as she looked at Luo Tian. After the four seven-source immortals had adjusted the Binding Spirit Band for Luo Tian, they also adjusted it for Jiang Sxi. After all, Jiang Sxi’s status was too high; if a disciple could control her Binding Spirit Band, she would no longer need to stay in Qinglong Sect.

“Enough. Go stand behind Sxi’s girl. You all knew each other before. I owe my success to the four of you!” Luo Tian smiled playfully, addressing Jiang Sxi and the three immortal elders.

Jiang Sxi’s face showed intense hatred upon seeing them. Had it not been for these three elders capturing Luo Tian to be her attendant, none of this would have happened. In an instant, she had fallen from being Qinglong Sect’s first genius to becoming her former attendant. How could Jiang Sxi accept this?

“Enough, stop fooling around. Disperse!” Grandmaster Sha Cangmang smiled slightly as he addressed Luo Tian.

Upon hearing the Grandmaster’s command, Qinglong Sect disciples did not dare to linger. They all left the Qinglong arena, their faces still filled with astonishment as they returned to their quarters. Yet everyone knew that from now on, Qinglong Sect had a genius who surpassed Jiang Sxi—a direct disciple of the Grandmaster named Luo Tian.

“Hum…” A wave of spiritual energy spread. Luo Tian followed Sha Cangmang, his face showing reverence, but his mind was deeply troubled. He did not understand why the Grandmaster had so greatly favored him.

Luo Tian knew his body was somewhat unique, but it was not enough for an eight-source immortal and a titan of the Four Sacred Star Domains to lower themselves to take him as a disciple.

Deep doubts arose in Luo Tian’s heart, but he dared not show them. After all, this man could obliterate him with a single gesture.

“Why do you so desperately wish to take me as your disciple?” Sha Cangmang led Luo Tian into a grand hall. His aged face bore a smile as he turned to address Luo Tian.

“You lack the aura of the Four Sacred Star Domains. Though others cannot sense it, those with a cultivation above the Immortal Stage can. You are not of the Four Sacred Star Domains. Yet all nearby continents fall under our four domains’ control—except one special place outside our jurisdiction: the former Sacred Domain battlefield, now known as Tianyuan Continent!” Sha Cangmang’s face bore a wistful expression, gazing at Luo Tian.

Sha Cangmang’s words shook Luo Tian. He had not expected his identity to be revealed so swiftly. His heart tensed.

“Though I am curious how you escaped from Tianyuan Continent, I bear no ill will toward you. In fact, I wish to grant you a great opportunity. As for what it is, you must wait until you reach the Heavenly Stage to learn. Until then, focus on your cultivation; Qinglong Sect’s resources are at your disposal!” Before Luo Tian could react, Sha Cangmang spoke again, causing Luo Tian’s face to shift.

“A great opportunity?” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with confusion. He knew this opportunity was not easily obtained; he did not believe in free lunches.

“Go. Your residence has already been arranged. Cultivate diligently and strive to reach the Heavenly Stage!” Sha Cangmang waved his hand, and Luo Tian vanished from the hall.

“Grandmaster, is this boy capable?” The four seven-source immortals who had returned with Sha Cangmang looked puzzled, gazing at him.

“Nine-element body type. Even I was moved. If this plan succeeds, sacrificing all of Qinglong Sect’s resources would be worth it!” Sha Cangmang smiled, his eyes gleaming with intensity.

Beyond Qinglong Continent, Jin Yongsi’s face bore a dark expression as he led his immortal-level strength toward the Baihu Continent.

“Grandmaster, is this boy from Tianyuan Continent? A mere genius of that continent. Why did you lower yourself to take him as a disciple?” One of Jin Yongsi’s immortal-level strength asked, his face puzzled.

“You know nothing. That is a nine-element body type. If I could possess him, with my experience, within ten years I would grasp the ninth fundamental path. Then, achieving a nine-source immortal status, the entire Four Sacred Star Domains would be ours!” Jin Yongsi’s face bore greed as he gazed toward Qinglong Continent.

Upon hearing Jin Yongsi’s words, the immortal-level strength men’s faces lit up with understanding.

“Right! We never thought of it. A nine-element body type is the most likely to become a nine-source immortal!” One of them bore the same greed, gazing at Qinglong Continent.

“What should we do, Grandmaster?” They asked, looking to Jin Yongsi. If Qinglong Sect obtained Luo Tian, and if someone from Qinglong achieved nine-source immortal status, it would not be good for Baihu Continent.

“Strive to win him over. If we cannot, capture him alive. If all else fails, kill him. We must not allow Qinglong Sect to grow stronger. Now the four continents are evenly matched; unification will be done by Baihu Sect!” Jin Yongsi’s face bore coldness as he vanished into the void.

...

Luo Tian sat comfortably on a soft chair, his face relaxed. Behind him stood Jiang Sxi, her face dark with fury. Though she wore a golden headband on her forehead, it did not mar her perfect beauty.

“Sxi, come here and massage my shoulders!” Luo Tian’s voice echoed through the empty hall, causing other attendants to grimace.

“Boom…” Jiang Sxi’s face was icy with fury. She suppressed the urge to massage Luo Tian’s shoulders, coldly saying, “Don’t push it!”

“Don’t be angry. Don’t forget your current status. Have you forgotten how you treated me? That poison pill I will never forget!” Luo Tian lightly patted Jiang Sxi’s shoulders, his expression playful.

“Don’t provoke me. I’ll fight to the death!” Jiang Sxi gritted her teeth, her eyes filled with hatred. If looks could kill, Luo Tian would have died countless times.

“Enough fooling around. Go away. No one is allowed to disturb me!” Luo Tian spoke softly, treating Jiang Sxi as if she were a servant.

“Damn fool. You really do see me as a servant!” Jiang Sxi glared at Luo Tian’s expression, wishing to kick him.

“Idiot. Don’t bother me. Who wants to disturb you?” Jiang Sxi roared upon returning to her quarters, causing the peach blossoms in the courtyard to fall.

Luo Tian smiled as he entered his bedroom. After returning yesterday, he had sealed the three two-source immortals’ cultivation and assigned them to clean the toilets.

Jiang Sxi had remained by Luo Tian’s side, discussing alchemy with him all day. It was only today that Luo Tian allowed her to leave.

“Hum…” The attendants in the courtyard were all dismissed by Luo Tian. He returned to his room alone, raising his hand and summoning countless elixirs and spiritual items before him.

“Qinglong Sect is indeed a major sect. So many resources—enough for me to ascend to five-source immortal!” Luo Tian grabbed a red crystal, his mind filled with thoughts. “Though I don’t know your purpose for making me reach five-source immortal so quickly, ascending to five-source is still good. It saves me the trouble of searching for resources!”

“Red Flame Essence!” The red crystal in Luo Tian’s hand radiated a fierce, scorching aura that surged into his body.

“Fire Path! Start with you. After all, I have the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame. Sensing its fire fundamental path should be effortless!” Luo Tian sat cross-legged, holding the Red Flame Essence. His Blue Crystal Luminous Flame also emerged from his body, enveloping him.

Luo Tian closed his eyes and began his cultivation retreat. Before entering it, he had informed his attendants not to disturb him.

One day… two days… time flowed slowly. Due to the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame, Luo Tian’s room was unusually hot, with a faint scent of burning.

With Luo Tian’s command, the attendants dared not disturb him. Yet some still appeared outside his courtyard to clean it, their faces filled with admiration. Now, Luo Tian was known by all in Qinglong Sect.

To the attendants’ minds, Luo Tian had become a deity. Starting as an attendant and ending up as the Grandmaster’s direct disciple, his story had become a legend among Qinglong Sect attendants.

Time passed without notice. After one month, Luo Tian finally opened his eyes. A fiery aura formed around him, and the Blue Crystal Luminous Flame surrounding him emitted a joyous sound.

“Hiss…” Luo Tian inhaled deeply, the Red Flame Essence transforming into dense fire-element spiritual energy that entered his body.

If someone were present before Luo Tian, they would see two red flames flickering in his eyes. His dantian contained a green aura, the spatial fundamental path he had previously sensed.

The red flames slowly descended and finally settled in his dantian, merging with the spatial fundamental path as a red aura.

“Success! The Fire Path Fundamental!” Luo Tian’s eyes sparkled with excitement, his voice filled with joy.

Chapter 758: Five Elements to Chaos

Chapter 758: Five Elements to Chaos

In Qinglong Sect, Luo Tian stood in his courtyard, face filled with joy. He felt the two fundamental paths within his body—strong spiritual energy forming around him, causing the attendants cleaning the courtyard to be shocked.

“Two-source immortal!” The attendants’ faces bore disbelief. It had only been a month since Luo Tian’s retreat, and he had not appeared in people’s sight. Now, upon his emergence, he was already a two-source immortal, leaving them in awe.

“Master is truly a genius. In just one month he has become a two-source immortal! Though the Grandmaster provided him with vast resources, this speed is terrifying!” The attendants murmured, their faces filled with admiration.

“Hmph! Master once killed Sun Shaohui with just a one-source immortal’s strength. How could we compare to him!” One attendant sneered, his eyes filled with fervor.

“Two-source immortal? Not enough. Let’s strive to master the five elements!” Luo Tian smiled, his gaze filled with anticipation.

Ignoring the attendants’ shock, he raised his hand and created a barrier to seal himself in. His hands formed seals rapidly. As the barrier appeared, Luo Tian’s figure vanished from the attendants’ sight.

“Sigh. Such talent and effort—Master would not be strong otherwise!” The attendants spoke in low voices, filled with respect.

One month… two months… time flowed slowly. Luo Tian never appeared in people’s sight again. The storm he had caused gradually faded.

Half a year later, Luo Tian had completely disappeared from people’s sight. Only his attendants visited daily to clean his courtyard, their faces filled with respect.

Alongside Luo Tian’s disappearance was Jiang Sxi. Whether due to a shock or feeling ashamed as an attendant, people never saw her again—not even Jiang Sxi’s attendants had seen the former first genius of Qinglong Sect.

As Luo Tian and Jiang Sxi vanished, Sima Qiong’s fame rose. Without Luo Tian and Jiang Sxi, and with Sun Shaohui killed by Luo Tian, Sima Qiong became the true focus of Qinglong Sect. People only occasionally mentioned Luo Tian.

Half a year passed quickly, and another topic of interest spread among Qinglong Sect disciples: the Sacred Domain Ranking Battle. This biennial event had become the focus of attention.

The Sacred Domain Ranking directly impacted all Qinglong Sect disciples. It was not merely a ranking but also determined the allocation of resources across the four continents for the next century. More resources meant greater natural advantages for disciples of the four sects, so all four sects took it seriously.

“Do you think our Qinglong Sect will be brought down this time? After all, Sun Shaohui is gone. Newcomer Luo Tian hasn’t appeared either. Even Jiang Sxi, our senior sister, has disappeared. Will she participate in the Sacred Domain Ranking?” Qinglong Sect disciples discussed anxiously, as the battle was less than two months away.

“Sigh. Only Sima Qiong remains. I think we’ll be at the bottom this time!” One disciple spoke, his face filled with disappointment.

Though Sima Qiong was strong, Qinglong Sect disciples did not have much confidence in him. After all, the other sects’ geniuses were on par with Jiang Sxi and Sun Shaohui.

While Qinglong Sect disciples discussed, a loud noise echoed from Luo Tian’s courtyard. Intense fluctuations shook the courtyard.

Inside the barrier, Luo Tian sat cross-legged, his spiritual energy gradually coalescing. His eyes were closed. After six months of cultivation retreat, his hair and beard had not been trimmed for a long time, nearly touching the ground. His appearance gave off an air of颓废.

But in an instant, Luo Tian suddenly opened his eyes. A brown aura flowed within them before settling into his dantian.

“Hum…” After six months of Qinglong Sect’s vast resources, Luo Tian had finally mastered the five basic elements’ fundamental paths.

The brown earth-element fundamental path settled in Luo Tian’s dantian. With the earth-element fundamental path settling, Luo Tian had ascended to six-source immortal.

“Six-source Heavenly Immortal. Only six months—this speed is unprecedented!” Luo Tian’s eyes sparkled with admiration as he clenched his fists.

“Hum…” But in an instant, Luo Tian felt a buzzing sound within his dantian.

Gold, wood, water, fire, and earth—five-colored fundamental energies seemed to connect, gradually converging.

A message passed into Luo Tian’s mind: “Five Elements to Chaos!”

“Five Elements to Chaos!” Luo Tian had once seen this transformation in Qinglong Sect’s ancient texts when he was Jiang Sxi’s attendant.

At the Immortal Stage, after mastering five basic fundamental paths, there was a chance to transform them into one great fundamental path—chaos fundamental. However, most people did not do this. Though transforming into chaos fundamental would make one’s strength drop by four levels—achieving five-source heavenly immortal, then transforming into chaos fundamental would make one a one-source earthly immortal. Though the strength was immense, it was still far behind five-source heavenly immortals.

“Merge or not merge?” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered with contemplation. He could clearly feel that if he willed it, the five fundamental paths would stop merging.

“Let’s gamble!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with madness. He knew the probability of transforming five-element fundamental into chaos was low, and encountering it was already a miracle.

Plus, chaos path was one of the great paths. If he could merge it, it would be immensely powerful.

On another note, Sha Cangmang had said that when Luo Tian reached the Heavenly Stage, he would give him a great opportunity. Though Luo Tian did not know what this opportunity was, he felt deep within that it would be a great crisis for him—perhaps even cost his life.

After careful consideration, Luo Tian decided to merge the five-element fundamental paths into chaos fundamental. For now, it was beneficial.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian made his decision, the five-element fundamental paths merged more rapidly. In a moment, the five fundamental paths converged into one gray fundamental energy, settling in Luo Tian’s dantian.

The spatial fundamental path he had first sensed retreated into a corner of the dantian, like a subject.

“Powerful!” Luo Tian stood up. The barrier he had set up shattered with a crash, scattering spiritual energy into the air.

“Come!” Luo Tian pointed his finger. The dense spiritual energy from Qinglong Sect’s sky rushed toward him, forming a massive spiritual vortex that covered Luo Tian’s courtyard and entered his body.

“Ascended!”

“Master has emerged!” The attendants’ faces bore excitement as they looked at the spiritual vortex in the sky.

Luo Tian stood still, a smile on his face. Infinite spiritual energy rushed into his body. At this moment, he seemed like a bottomless pit.

“Two-source immortal?”

“What’s going on? Master was already two-source immortal half a year ago. Why is he still two-source?” The attendants were confused, not understanding why Luo Tian remained at two-source.

After six months of silence, Luo Tian had still made no progress. This confused the attendants.

“Someone has ascended; the commotion is significant!” Qinglong Sect disciples’ faces bore astonishment. Such a commotion was more like an ascension to the Heavenly Stage.

“That’s Luo Tian’s courtyard, right?” One界尊境 disciple spoke, his face filled with joy.

Upon hearing this disciple’s words, people were also shocked. The name that had disappeared for half a year was mentioned again, reminding them of Luo Tian’s power half a year ago.

“Let’s go see. If Luo Tian has ascended to the Heavenly Stage, our Qinglong Sect will definitely be first!” Qinglong Sect disciples’ faces brightened. They flew toward Luo Tian’s courtyard as streams of light.

However, when people arrived near Luo Tian’s courtyard, their faces bore endless disappointment.

“Two-source immortal? After disappearing for half a year, he’s still just two-source. Is this a genius?” Qinglong Sect disciples felt Luo Tian’s cultivation, their faces filled with contempt. Some disciples even ridiculed him before vanishing.

“Crack…” After an hour, Luo Tian finally finished absorbing the spiritual energy. He smiled slightly, looking at the contemptuous gazes around him and clenched his fists.

“Though I am still two-source immortal, with chaos fundamental, I should fear no one below five-source earthly immortals!” Luo Tian thought to himself, assessing his strength and comparing it with that of five-source heavenly immortals.

Chapter 759: Sacred Domain Ranking Battle

Chapter 759: Sacred Domain Ranking Battle

Luo Tian stood in the courtyard, a smile on his face. Around him, Qinglong Sect disciples bore expressions of disappointment or mockery.

“Haha, just two-source immortal. It seems our Sacred Domain Ranking Battle is doomed!” One disciple spoke with mockery.

During this time, Sima Qiong had also ascended to three-source immortal. Even so, Qinglong Sect disciples were still worried. How much more so for Luo Tian being just two-source!

“Hearing that disciples from the other three sects have already reached four-source immortal. It seems our Qinglong Sect will definitely be at the bottom! I hope Jiang Sxi returns!” Another disciple, answering the previous one, muttered.

“Right. We still have Jiang Sxi. After half a year, she must have reached four-source immortal!” People’s faces bore hope but soon turned to disappointment. Jiang Sxi’s courtyard had no movement at all, even the yard was overgrown with weeds.

“What does the Sacred Domain Ranking Battle compare?” Luo Tian approached a nearby attendant, his face filled with interest.

“The Sacred Domain Ranking Battle is not just about strength but also includes four secondary professions: alchemy, forging, arrays, and seals. Strength is only part of it!” The attendant spoke respectfully, explaining the rules of the Sacred Domain Ranking Battle.

Upon hearing the attendant’s explanation, Luo Tian’s face bore a slight interest. The prizes of this Sacred Domain Grand Competition were what intrigued him most—control over a continent. Qinglong Sect directly awarded disciples who performed well in the ranking with a inhabited continent.

Though not large, it was as big as the northern region of Tianyuan Continent. This made Luo Tian’s heart beat faster. He did not know why he felt that his stay in Qinglong Sect would not be long, but if he offended Qinglong Sect within the Four Sacred Star Domains, there would be no place for him to stay.

“I hope I can participate!” Luo Tian’s face bore a slight expectation, hoping to obtain control over a continent as his base for returning to Tianyuan Continent.

The disciples around him bore various expressions and dispersed. Luo Tian’s courtyard returned to calm, leaving only Luo Tian and some attendants.

The attendants looked at Luo Tian with complex expressions. They still did not believe he was merely two-source immortal. They thought he must have used some means to hide his cultivation, surprising Qinglong Sect disciples in the Sacred Domain Ranking Battle.

“Enough. Disperse! Fix my room!” Luo Tian smiled as he addressed the attendants.

With a light wave of his hand, spiritual energy flew from his fingers. His long hair and beard fell, returning to a youthful appearance.

His golden headband reappeared on his head, floating slightly. It was unusually eye-catching.

Luo Tian stepped out of the courtyard and soared into the sky toward Jiang Sxi’s courtyard, wanting to see what progress she had made in his absence for half a year.

“Hum…” Three steps, and Luo Tian instantly appeared in Jiang Sxi’s courtyard.

“Hmm?” Luo Tian frowned slightly, sensing the desolation of Jiang Sxi’s courtyard. His face bore confusion.

“Not here?” His vast spiritual awareness encompassed Jiang Sxi’s large courtyard but found no sign of her. Luo Tian let out a light laugh and extended his hand, drawing patterns in the sky.

“Hum…” A fluctuation arose. Through a subconscious perception, Luo Tian felt Jiang Sxi was not within Qinglong Sect or even Qinglong Continent. Though so, he sensed she was immensely powerful—no less than himself.

Luo Tian did not care much and returned to his courtyard, sitting cross-legged.

“With two months until the Sacred Domain Ranking Battle, I should strive to master another great fundamental path and achieve three-source immortal. That would be safe. Also, I must not neglect alchemy; it plays a significant role in the Sacred Domain Ranking Battle. Try to strive for an Imperial-grade alchemist!” Luo Tian mused, then closed his eyes again.

As news of Luo Tian being merely two-source immortal spread, Qinglong Sect disciples’ attention toward him diminished.

Under the organization of Qinglong Sect elders, disciples participating in the Sacred Domain Ranking Battle were determined. Luo Tian was on the list.

Besides Luo Tian, Jiang Sxi and Sima Qiong were also on the list, leaving people puzzled.

Upon the list’s announcement, people found Jiang Sxi’s name on it and were overjoyed. Her strength and alchemical expertise in Qinglong Sect disciples’ hearts were unmatched. Even after becoming Luo Tian’s attendant, people did not believe Luo Tian could surpass her.

Time passed day by day. Luo Tian remained in cultivation retreat, and Jiang Sxi did not appear in Qinglong Sect either. Yet the Sacred Domain Ranking Battle was only seven days away.

Qinglong Sect disciples who wanted to watch the battle gathered and headed toward the location of this grand event in the Four Sacred Star Domains—Fengshen Continent.

Fengshen Continent was a special continent in the Four Sacred Star Domains, guarded by the four sects. No other sect’s disciples were present except during the Sacred Domain Ranking Battle.

At that moment, a vast platform surrounded by an endless crowd was filled with people. All sects in the Four Sacred Star Domains had crowded around it.

“People are really numerous. This four-star ranking battle is more lively each year!” Countless people discussed on Fengshen Continent, making it bustling.

These sects were all from the Four Sacred Star Domains. Some had friendly relations, others had deep enmity. However, during the four-star ranking battle, no conflicts could occur unless on the arena; otherwise, anyone found causing conflict would face annihilation by the four major sects.

Luo Tian smiled faintly, looking at his hundreds of attendants. He spoke softly: “Let’s go and tour the Sacred Domain Ranking Battle. After all, I am on the list!”

“Yes!” The attendants’ faces bore excitement. These people had not been treated well due to Luo Tian’s presence, though no one dared to provoke them. However, they had not received good treatment either.

Now that Luo Tian emerged from his retreat, the attendants were overjoyed. Especially when they felt he had become a three-source immortal, their faces bore great joy.

“Master must have special means! His strength is unparalleled. Otherwise, he would not have achieved no fundamental paths in six months!” The attendants’ eyes glowed with intensity, looking at Luo Tian with respect.

Due to his cultivation retreat, Luo Tian had not joined the main group of Qinglong Sect. Thus, he could only go alone.

Luo Tian led the way, followed by over a hundred界尊境 disciples who had grasped a hint of chaos power and were at the peak of their cultivation. Their faces bore reverence as they followed Luo Tian.

Their speed was fast, and in half a day, they exited Qinglong Continent and appeared in the boundless domain beyond.

Upon exiting, Luo Tian felt countless powerful auras gathering toward one direction.

Luo Tian smiled slightly. He recalled the map of the Four Sacred Star Domains in his mind, gazing toward the distant void. He knew that deep within this vast Four Sacred Star Domains lay his hometown, Tianyuan Continent.

“Tianyuan Continent, wait for me!” Luo Tian whispered softly and transformed into a streak of light toward Fengshen Continent.

The attendants behind him dared not ask further and unleashed their cultivation, following Luo Tian toward Fengshen Continent.
