"Your efforts are unnecessary. This ancient heavenly palace is an unparalleled divine treasure; only those destined to possess it may claim it, and no one can obtain it merely by desire. Even sub-epoch treasures are difficult to subdue, let alone one surpassing the epoch itself!" Long Jie said with indifference, his gaze turning to Luotian. He had confidence in Luotian and never intended to compete with him.

"Indeed, it's about fate, not strength!" The three spirit guardians spoke in unison, addressing the eighteen people.

"Ugh! So all this was for nothing! Making us fight with Long Jie, what a waste!" Diao Dezhu and others protested, muttering discontentedly.

"Stop talking," Luotian spoke up, silencing the chatter. His gaze turned to the three spirit guardians.

The people of the Divine Clan and the Star Luo Domain, as well as the Beast Domain, sighed in relief. If the eighteen had their way, they would have had no chance at all.

"Though we lack a pseudo-epoch treasure, this ancient heavenly palace is invaluable. Compared to the three pseudo-epoch treasures before, it's far superior. Once we obtain this ancient heavenly palace, those three pseudo-epoch treasures would be worthless; it's better to abandon them!" Feng Jiutian's face showed determination as he gazed at the three spirit guardians.

"An ancient heavenly palace! It's been centuries since it appeared, and now it finally has a master!" The people of the Divine Clan and Beast Domain showed excitement. If they truly possessed this ancient heavenly palace, with a sage at the peak of his power or near the epoch level activating it, its might would be world-shattering and fearless against any faction.

"I have a great advantage: the ancient existence within the Epoch Scripture. Because he himself is the master of this ancient heavenly palace!" Luotian clenched his fists. If they obtained the ancient heavenly palace, the Four Sacred Star Domains and the Fire Domain would gain an additional safeguard. The barrier outside the ancient heavenly palace capable of crushing a sage in the middle stage, combined with these three spirit guardians' strength, would make it impossible to ignore.

If any catastrophe arose, they could instantly bring their loved ones into this ancient heavenly palace. Even sages at the peak of power would dare not enter recklessly.

Luotian's eyes also showed determination, a look of unwavering resolve.

The people from the Fire Domain and Four Sacred Star Domains also showed hopeful expressions. They knew that if they truly controlled the ancient heavenly palace, as long as they didn't encounter an epoch-level powerhouse, this ancient heavenly palace would be a sacred place.

"Are you all doing nothing? Hurrying so slowly? Can't you handle this?" As people discussed, a cold scoff echoed. An old man appeared in their sight.

His appearance was ordinary, seemingly ethereal but truly present, giving people a suffocating pressure.

"Master!" Hearing this voice, the three secondary spirit guardians' faces changed. They quickly smiled and looked at the old man who had appeared on the altar.

"Main spirit guardian!" The eighteen people's faces changed, gazing at the old man with respect. Even two sages at the peak of their power bowed slightly, showing reverence to the main spirit guardian.

"Have you selected everyone?" The old man surveyed the eighteen people. In this ancient heavenly palace, he was an absolute ruler, unmatched by anyone. Having survived countless years as an immortal being, even the epoch masters had perished, but this ancient heavenly palace still remained. This was the terrifying power of an epoch master's legacy, a kind of eternal life.

"Yes! We were about to take them to meet you!" The three spirit guardians became more respectful, even the one guarding the bloodthirsty weapon who was usually playful had put away his amusement. The fat old man secretly took the chicken leg from his mouth.

Luotian, Feng Jiutian, Sun Mengru, and Zhou Weizhan stood at the front of the crowd. Their faces showed respect as they gazed at the old man, knowing he was likely the master of this ancient heavenly palace.

"Alright! Come with me!" The old man saw Luotian and the others, glanced at them briefly, nodded in satisfaction, then spoke to them.

"Um... we..." Xiong Kaishan shouted towards the old man, causing the eighteen people's mouths to twitch.

"You have no chance! If there was a chance, this ancient heavenly palace would have been given to you!" The old man spoke to them, shaking his head. He led Luotian and the others up onto the grand altar.

"Good enough!" Xiong Kaishan and the others muttered, then turned their eyes to the four remaining factions.

"Come on, who wants this epoch-level imprint?" Xiong Kaishan and the others' eyes gleamed, watching Diao Dezhu and the others like predators. Their voices carried mockery.

Hearing the eighteen's words, Diao Dezhu and others' eyes gleamed. They gazed at the vast altar. An imprint of an epoch-level powerhouse, how precious it was! In this era where epoch-level warriors were nearly extinct, one such warrior could sweep through many sacred places. Even if they didn't use it themselves, having an elder in their clan become epoch-level would be a great blessing.

"Respected elder, what must one do to obtain this epoch-level imprint?" Diao Dezhu asked Xiong Kaishan.

"No need for anything. See? We have eighteen people here. You can challenge any one of us. If you defeat any one of us, it's done!" The eighteen people laughed, gazing at the crowd.

"Ugh! Is that possible!" Xu Liyi wanted to curse but restrained himself.

"Don't worry, we won't take advantage. We'll self-restrain our cultivation and fight on equal terms!" One old man clenched his fist, gazing at them.

"Ha! Finally get to stretch my limbs. I've had enough of fighting with these old guys and being beaten!" Xiong Kaishan laughed, stepping forward to the front of the crowd.

"I'll go. I choose that elder!" Diao Dezhu spoke first, pointing at Ding Wenxing and standing in the center of the crowd.

"Kid, think carefully. Don't underestimate Xiao Ding. Though he's ranked eighteenth, his strength is undeniable!" The eighteen people showed interest.

Ding Wenxing's face darkened. He hadn't expected this sly little guy to choose him immediately, treating him like a soft target.

"Deceitful! Ding Wenxing just fought with Long Jie. Though he seems to have recovered, there's definitely some lingering effect!" People saw Diao Dezhu's smugness and secretly cursed.

"I choose that elder!" Lu Han Tian showed respect, pointing at Gu Yuanyun.

"I choose... I choose..." People spoke one after another, selecting their opponents. The later the selection, the stronger the opponent. However, aside from Lu Han Tian and Diao Dezhu selecting people, others remained still, smiling on their faces.

A thunderous sound rose throughout the hall as groups clashed with each other, shaking the hall continuously.

The three spirit guardians shook their heads gently and exchanged glances before disappearing from sight. Compared to this, they cared more about who would obtain the ancient heavenly palace since it determined their future master.

"A hum..." A ripple spread. The main spirit guardian led Luotian and the others to a dark starry sky, where space was void. Yet, stars filled the darkness, their light almost illuminating the entire sky.

Vast and endless, Luotian's group showed awe. If it weren't for the spirit guardians nearby, they would have thought they had left the ancient heavenly palace.

"This isn't outside the domain. It's a starry sky that the master hadn't perished yet, which he refined into the palace!" The old man spoke, his voice filled with reverence and nostalgia.

"These stars aren't continents. They're just stars no one inhabits. Moreover, each star contains special mineral deposits. You'll understand when you obtain the palace!" The old man spoke again, his voice calmer.

Luotian's group marveled. Refining a starry sky and storing it within one's treasure, what an astonishing technique.

"Unexpectedly, a great power ended up like this!" Luotian felt some melancholy, recalling the soul fragment of the old man in the Epoch Scripture.

"I called you here for this!" The old man pointed, and the endless starry sky began to stir. A colossal object appeared in their sight, floating above the infinite stars.

A heavy pressure instantly made them sweat. Their eyes showed awe as they gazed at the object several thousand zhang away, resembling a jade mountain. Green light radiated from it, and its true nature was indistinguishable until approaching.

Chapter 996: The Body of the Epoch ( )

In a strange starry sky within the ancient heavenly palace, Luotian and his group showed awe as they gazed at an object emitting green light several thousand zhang away. They couldn't determine what it was, even their spiritual awareness failed to detect it.

"What is this thing that can block our spiritual awareness? And the pressure is so great, even from this distance, I feel suffocated. My body feels unresponsive, and my blood boils!" Zhou Weizhan, usually calm, showed fear, gazing at the distance.

Others were the same. Each face bore fear as they looked at the colossal object obscured by green light.

"Come on!" The old man didn't let them speak, leading them toward the green light while his respect deepened.

As they approached closer, they finally saw what was inside the green light.

"It's a coffin!" Feng Jiutian exclaimed, surprised. A coffin had given them such immense pressure. If it weren't for the main spirit guardian protecting them, he would have doubted his body would disintegrate under this overwhelming pressure.

"This is Tiancan Xuan Jade. A small piece the size of a fist can be refined into an ultimate sage weapon. Yet it's made into a coffin! What kind of person is buried inside?" Zhou Weizhan spoke, his voice filled with shock.

"Ah..." Everyone gasped, gazing at the colossal Tiancan Xuan Jade that looked like a mountain. They all gasped.

"there are characters on it!" Luotian's eyes flashed with purple light, trying to see what terrifying thing was hidden within the Tiancan Xuan Jade coffin.

But soon Luotian was disappointed. Even with his Purple Extreme Eye opened, he found no results. He could only see a line of characters on the emerald coffin lid.

"Epoch Master, Meng Lingyun's position!" Luotian whispered lowly, his eyes showing awe as he gazed at the characters on the coffin. His mouth opened wide as if swallowing a mountain.

"Epoch Master! My god! We've seen the tomb of an epoch master!" Feng Jiutian and others, hearing Luotian's whisper, widened their eyes in disbelief. They hadn't expected this extravagant coffin to contain an epoch master.

"Old man... old man..." Luotian's spiritual awareness figure appeared in his mind, shouting at the Epoch Scripture.

But no matter how Luotian called, the old man didn't appear. The Epoch Scripture showed no movement.

"Ah..." Luotian sighed, knowing the old man perhaps didn't want his former spirit guardians to see him in this state.

"Of course, the aura alone was enough to scare us. Now I know it's an epoch master!" Feng Jiutian showed excitement, gazing at the jade coffin.

The body of an epoch master was as precious as an epoch treasure. Though epoch masters would also be worn by time, their bodies could achieve eternal flesh, becoming another form of immortality. If studied carefully, there might be astonishing discoveries.

Not only that, if the body of an epoch master was refined into a weapon, it would surely be an epoch treasure. Who in the world could break an epoch master's body?

Feng Jiutian knew so much because the Beast Domain's Holy City was sealed with an epoch treasure. This epoch treasure was the body of a former epoch master from the Beast Domain, who had luckily found the previous epoch master's body and taken one of his arms to refine it into an epoch treasure. It was sealed within the Beast Domain, becoming its foundation.

"Indeed, it's the body of an epoch master. That was my master!" The main spirit guardian showed reverence, bowing three times to the jade coffin.

"The ancient heavenly palace is definitely an epoch treasure!" Feng Jiutian, Sun Mengru, and Zhou Weizhan's eyes gleamed with light. Their breathing became more urgent. At this moment, they had completely confirmed the ancient heavenly palace was an epoch treasure. From the spirit guardians' behavior, the master of this palace was that elder named Meng Lingyun.

"Meng Lingyun! The last epoch master!" Around them, it seemed they remembered something. Their eyes widened.

"Yes, I've heard of him in the Divine Clan's records! After Meng Lingyun, the world seemed to change. No epoch masters have appeared since!" Sun Mengru, usually cold, spoke in disbelief.

It was truly shocking to see a person who had been an invincible being for ten million years buried in this jade coffin.

Luotian was relatively calm, as Meng Lingyun's soul fragment lay there in his Epoch Scripture.

"Hmph... country bumpkin, have you never heard of an epoch master? Are you confused?" Feng Jiutian, now greatly strengthened in power, seemed fearless against Luotian and began mocking him.

Luotian's current mindset was completely undisturbed. Even with Feng Jiutian mocking him, he didn't take it to heart, remaining calm and composed.

"Wait until you defeat me before scolding me!" Luotian said, showing respect and bowing three times to the coffin. After all, Meng Lingyun had once saved his life.

"Although it's my master's body, it's incomplete. Whoever can awaken a bit of vitality from this body will pass the test!" The old man showed hope.

"Incomplete body!" Feng Jiutian and others exchanged glances, unable to believe that someone could damage an epoch master's body.

"Just a bit of vitality. To awaken this body's vitality, you need your blood!" The old man spoke slowly.

"It's not just that. If you truly become the master of this palace, your strength will increase greatly, but you'll also have a responsibility: to avenge our master!" The old man's face showed hatred, his voice cold enough to make Luotian and the others shiver.

Feng Jiutian and others trembled. They thought about how terrifying the person who had killed an epoch master must be.

"Who could kill an epoch master? Is that being human?" Zhou Weizhan asked the old man, his eyes filled with doubt.

"If it were honest, it wouldn't be possible. But in my master's final days, he used underhanded methods!" The old man saw their gazes and answered softly.

Though it was a treacherous trap, the one who had trapped an epoch master nearing his end must be another formidable being. They couldn't confront it, even their sacred places behind them could not match it. At this moment, the group felt some hesitation.

"Scared?" The old man seemed to sense their thoughts and showed mockery, shaking his head slightly.

"What's there to fear? The path of invincibility is always against the world. I'm not afraid!" Long Jie showed determination, his confident invincibility making Feng Jiutian and others feel ashamed.

Luotian simply smiled, saying nothing. But a bitterness flashed in his eyes. His current physical state was indeed abnormal, but that wasn't a reason for him to give up. He believed there was no absolute in the world, even if it were the suppression of heaven and earth, there must be a way to break through.

With their encouragement, Sun Mengru, Feng Jiutian, and Zhou Weizhan also showed confidence. They believed they could be invincible at their level.

"Alright, I'll open the coffin lid. There's only one chance. You must seize it!" The old man spoke to Luotian and the others, his gaze scanning over Luotian.

As the main spirit guardian of the entire heavenly palace, he was an absolute ruler. His strength needed no explanation; it was a being of immense power. However, he could not leave the ancient heavenly palace.

As an ancient entity who had followed the epoch master for countless years, his eyes were not ordinary. He could see that Luotian was suppressed by heaven and earth but it didn't matter. What he needed was blood, the strength of one's lineage.

Especially Sun Mengru, Long Jie, and Feng Jiutian. Their bloodlines were incredibly powerful: the Primordial Body, thick dragon lineage, and immortal phoenix blood. Each was a rare bloodline.

Luotian and Zhou Weizhan didn't know what kind of body they had. The old man couldn't see it, but that was enough to prove their bodies were extraordinary.

The old man's hands moved swiftly, appearing ordinary but emitting an unusual aura that passed into the group's minds. This made their minds tremble, as they could feel this power would destroy them if it hit.

"Open..." A low shout echoed in the starry sky. The jade coffin, sealed for countless years, emitted a humming sound as if an ancient beast was awakening. It sent a terrifying aura that made people shudder.

Pressure instantly fell upon them, causing their strong bodies to emit a creaking sound. If it weren't for the old man protecting them, they would have been destroyed. A dead epoch master had such power; if he truly revived, it would be a terrifying existence.

"Buzz..." Waves spread from the coffin. At the same time, strong vitality was transmitted to them, making them feel extremely comfortable.

The old man led the five of them up into the sky above the coffin, allowing them to finally see the full view of the coffin. They all caught their breath.

In their sight, a half-body elder lay there, wrapped in green light. There was no sign of decay.

Though he had been dead for many years, it still made Luotian and the others feel a sense of worship they couldn't control.

"This is my master, the epoch master, Meng Lingyun!" The old man spoke slowly, scanning over the five of them.

Chapter 997: Battle of Bloodline Power

In the starry sky of the ancient heavenly palace, Luotian and five others showed curiosity as they gazed at the half-body inside the jade coffin. Though it was only a half, its aura was terrifyingly immense, like an endless black hole that could absorb everything around it.

"If this body is refined into a treasure, it would definitely be an epoch treasure! The body of an epoch master!" Feng Jiutian couldn't help but exclaim, his eyes filled with greed.

It wasn't strange for Feng Jiutian to feel this way. Even a sage at the peak of his power would be greedy upon encountering such a half-body, let alone Feng Jiutian at the early stage of sagehood.

"What did you say?" The old man's face showed a fierce killing intent. His cold voice echoed throughout the starry sky, making Feng Jiutian tremble and his teeth start to shake. He instantly froze in place as if a formless hand had choked his throat.

"Respected elder, mercy..." Feng Jiutian's teeth chattered as he spoke to the old man, realizing he had said something wrong.

"Hmph..." The old man let out a cold hum. His voice carried annoyance: "If you dare to think of this body, your soul and flesh will be destroyed!"

The old man was overwhelmingly strong. His words echoed in their minds, making them all shiver.

Thinking back, the old man indeed had this power. As long as one wasn't an epoch-level powerhouse, they couldn't match the old man. Being immortal for countless years, he naturally had transcendent methods.

They quickly nodded. Even Luotian felt the old man had truly intended to kill him, not just talking.

Seeing the old man didn't speak but gazed at the half-body, they also turned their eyes back to the epoch master, Meng Lingyun's body.

Luotian's eyes slightly opened. Through endless green light, he took in the entire scene within the coffin. His face showed another shock. This was not the first time Luotian had been shocked, even with his perfected mindset, but his heart still beat uncontrollably.

"This is the Wu Chang Wood... an ultimate medicinal herb. Looking at its age, it must be tens of thousands of years old. This is the Chi Long Absolute Grass. It's said that this grass grows only an inch every million years. This one is several zhang high, how many years must it have taken to grow!" Luotian's eyes showed surprise as he gazed at the ultimate medicinal herbs surrounding this half-body. He almost drooled.

"Immortal herb, one that can delay life! There are so many of them!" Feng Jiutian and others also noticed the various vigorous medicinal herbs within the jade coffin. If they took one out, it would surely cause a frenzy among the major sacred places and clans. Each herb was worth as much as a section of an immortal life bamboo in an auction.

"An unparalleled divine treasure! Indeed, the epoch master's burial place has so many medicinal herbs!" Zhou Weizhan showed a touch of admiration.

"This ancient heavenly palace's value is enough to match that of a sacred place!" Sun Mengru nodded, speaking softly.

"Yes, it was built as a sacred place," the old man spoke softly, his voice filled with admiration.

What shocked Luotian most was a small tree-like medicinal herb floating beside Meng Lingyun's body.

"Medicinal King..." Luotian was speechless. He had seen the Medicinal King, a legendary herb that rarely appeared. It only emerged under perfect conditions of timing, location, and people. Its emergence probability was the same as that of an epoch master.

"Don't be greedy. If you can awaken a bit of vitality in this body, these medicinal herbs will all belong to you!" The old man spoke softly, making Luotian and the others' breathing slightly uneven.

"Don't look at me like that. Except for this Medicinal King, you can take any of them freely. Of course, it's conditional on awakening a bit of vitality in this body—just a little!" The old man showed expectation.

"Wait, does that mean this body can still be saved? Does Meng Lingyun's elder have a chance of revival?" Deep doubts arose in their minds, making them shocked for the hundredth time. Especially Luotian's eyes showed great joy. If Meng Lingyun truly revived, it would be of infinite benefit to him. Plus, the soul fragment of Meng Lingyun was in the Epoch Scripture.

"It's just an attempt. I'm not sure if it's feasible," the old man softly shook his head, unsure of its viability.

"Alright, let your blood out!" The old man spoke to the four people, his voice carrying a touch of tension.

"Roar..." A low dragon roar echoed. Long Jie, who had been impatient for a long time, extended his hand and a drop of golden dragon blood floated out from his finger.

"Dragon Ancestor's Blood, good!" The old man nodded slowly, showing satisfaction. He then gazed at the four people.

When Feng Jiutian saw Long Jie's blood, his face showed a touch of greed. However, he quickly suppressed it and extended his hand. A drop of red phoenix blood surged out. Though only a single drop, it carried immense pressure, like a reborn phoenix.

Sun Mengru extended her finger. A drop of golden sage blood floated out from her white fingers. The powerful aura was no less than Long Jie's, even subtly suppressing it.

The moonlight shone on Sun Mengru's blood. A moon image appeared from her blood, cold and serene.

"Indeed different is the blood of the Primordial Body!" Zhou Weizhan shook his head lightly. Compared to him, Luotian and Zhou Weizhan's blood seemed slightly weak. Though their energy was powerful, it was somewhat inferior to the three others.

"Come on, this is a different kind of battle. Let me see who has stronger blood!" The old man spoke softly, nodding. He clearly was satisfied with their blood.

Hearing the old man's words, Luotian and the others activated their hands. Five drops of blood, with astonishing fluctuations, collided toward each other.

In this case, they couldn't unite against one person. After all, it was a contest of who had stronger blood, unrelated to strength.

In an instant, the five drops of blood collided. Lightning surged around them, enveloping the five drops.

"Hmm?" All five people furrowed their brows. Since it was their own lifeblood, they naturally could sense the situation of the five drops.

"Evenly matched?" Feng Jiutian's face showed confusion, unable to believe it.

In Feng Jiutian's view, only Long Jie, Sun Mengru, and himself had a chance to compete. Luotian and Zhou Weizhan's blood was powerful, but compared to theirs, it was slightly inferior.

"Competition with me? You'll never beat me in bloodline power!" However, Feng Jiutian's face soon regained its smile. His confidence returned.

In their spiritual awareness, the five drops of blood fiercely devoured each other. Luotian and Zhou Weizhan's blood gradually fell behind, being pushed out by the three drops of Long Jie, Sun Mengru, and Feng Jiutian.

"Boom..." Finally, a sound rose from the five drops of blood. Zhou Weizhan's slightly green holy blood floated out from the merged drop, making him show a slight smile of sorrow.

"Alas... failed!" Zhou Weizhan sighed, somewhat reluctant as he gazed at the jade coffin. He knew this heavenly palace's master might be out of his reach.

"Kid, it's your turn now!" Feng Jiutian showed a touch of joy. Finally being able to surpass Luotian in one place made him excited.

Luotian's brows slightly furrowed. Though he knew his bloodline power was strong, even matching Long Jie's to some extent, compared to those with special body types, it was still somewhat inferior.

However, Luotian didn't lose heart. He believed even without powerful bloodlines, he could still reach the peak and surpass these strong-typed prodigies.

"Out it comes!" Feng Jiutian and others watched the single drop of blood. Luotian's blood floated out, apparently following Zhou Weizhan's fate.

"Brother, our fates are the same, hahaha!" Zhou Weizhan extended his hand to retrieve the blood drifting toward him.

But in the next moment, that drop of green blood paused briefly before rushing toward Luotian's separated blood.

"What's going on?" Zhou Weizhan was stunned, watching his own blood, unsure of what had happened.

Luotian also felt confused. He shook his head slightly, indicating he wasn't sure. His gaze was on his own blood, which showed no changes.

The old spirit guardian's face also showed confusion. His brows slightly furrowed before his eyes opened, gazing at Luotian as if trying to see through him completely.

"Buzz..." In his vision, Luotian's blood suddenly expanded, causing waves. It instantly devoured the surrounding blood, as if refining it and merging with it.

Zhou Weizhan's face turned pale. He gazed at Luotian, sensing clearly that he had completely severed his connection with that drop of blood.

"Buzz..." Lightning intertwined with Luotian's blood. It experienced a thunderstorm, as if declaring his blood was the strongest. Around Luotian, it circled once before floating above his head.

"This... this..." Three old figures appeared in the starry sky, staring in disbelief at Luotian. They wanted to speak but were stopped by the main spirit guardian.

Chapter 998: Blood of a Sage's Heart

In the endless starry sky of the ancient heavenly palace, a golden drop of blood floated above the emerald jade coffin. It radiated a slight pressure.

"Unexpectedly, it devoured our blood!" Feng Jiutian's face was grim. He watched the floating drop of blood, speaking lowly with a touch of shock. He hadn't expected such an odd occurrence.

Not only Feng Jiutian was surprised, but Sun Mengru, Long Jie, and Zhou Weizhan also had pale faces as they gazed at the golden drop of blood.

Even the main spirit guardian, who had lived countless years, and the three secondary spirit guardians who had just appeared showed shock. Then they seemed to recall some terrifying legend, their eyes filled with disbelief as they gazed at Luotian, like looking at a treasure.

"Did you previously have the Five Elements Body?" The main spirit guardian asked in a trembling voice, his gaze on Luotian. People's eyes turned to Luotian.

Luotian was also stunned, not expecting his blood to be so strange. After hearing the main spirit guardian's question, he nodded instinctively.

"Did you later merge with other elements?" The main spirit guardian became more excited, approaching Luotian and carefully examining him. This made Luotian feel somewhat uncomfortable.

"Yes, I did merge with other elements!" Luotian nodded slightly. He thought of the situation on Tianyuan Continent, where he had transformed his meridians in the North Sea.

"It's confirmed! The ability to merge and transform into multiple elements, and blood that can devour other prodigies' blood—there's no mistake!" The main spirit guardian muttered, gazing at Luotian.

The three secondary spirit guardians also showed joy, gazing at Luotian. They almost made Luotian uncomfortable, as if the four old men wanted to do something to him.

Zhou Weizhan and others furrowed their brows, as if recalling ancient records. Their eyes showed confusion, gazing at Luotian.

"I remember!" Sun Mengru's eyes widened. Her gaze showed waves of light, filled with shock.

"What do you mean?" Feng Jiutian and Zhou Weizhan showed confusion, gazing at Sun Mengru, waiting for her explanation.

"If I'm not mistaken, his body type is the first among the nine body types, the most mysterious Reincarnation Body!" Sun Mengru spoke softly, her voice filled with uncertainty.

"What? How is that possible!" Feng Jiutian and Zhou Weizhan widened their eyes, gazing at Luotian in disbelief.

Luotian was also stunned. He hadn't felt any special aspects of his bloodline.

Only Long Jie remained calm, standing there. He had previously sensed Luotian's body type was unusual. Though it was fine before, now that Long Jie knew he was Long Zhan Tian and had gained many memories of Long Zhan Tian, he could sense the terrifying power within Luotian's bloodline. If Luotian were an ordinary person, he would have been crushed by his own bloodline power when he had凝聚 the Nirvana Dragon Seal in the Great An Forest. Now it all made sense.

"Based on various signs, this kid is indeed a rare Reincarnation Body!" The main spirit guardian showed admiration, gazing at Luotian.

The first among the nine body types. This was enough to explain Luotian's talent. Now it made sense why he had advanced so quickly.

The nine body types each differed, but they were all incredibly powerful. In an epoch, having one or two was already rare. It could be said that if the nine body types didn't die early, they would surely become epoch-level masters. Even among epoch masters, they had the ability to escape safely.

At present, Sun Mengru's powerful Primordial Body had already shown people the terrifying power of special body types. At such a young age, she was a sage-level powerhouse with an unlimited future.

Moreover, in the ancient traditions of Star Luo Domain and Beast Domain, there were records about the nine body types. Some epoch masters had even been recorded as having special body types, with almost half of them being such.

"Reincarnation Body! It's been so long since it appeared. How could it be him!" Feng Jiutian showed resentment. He hadn't expected Luotian's talent to be so good, being the most mysterious Reincarnation Body.

"But the facts and signs indicate this kid is indeed a Reincarnation Body! However, it's a pity!" The old main spirit guardian showed a touch of regret. He knew Luotian was suppressed by heaven and earth, making it harder for him to advance than climbing a mountain.
