“Who... dares disturb my Tian Ge’s peace!” As the blood-colored phantom’s massive hand descended, a cold voice echoed across the vast altar, carrying an aura of invincibility. The voice faded, and the crimson hand exploded into violent fluctuations, radiating outward in a storm of power.

The hum resonated within Luo Tian’s heart, filling him with profound awe. He gazed at the altar where Zhongli Tian sat in meditation. Luo Tian had believed himself doomed, for in that moment of the blood-colored hand’s descent, he could barely withstand its immense pressure. His body teetered on the brink of collapse. Had it not been for that voice, he would have been annihilated entirely.

A surge of divine laws rose from the altar, and radiant light cascaded down. A white-clad woman emerged within the divine glow, her presence breathtakingly magnificent—none other than Miaoyin, Zhongli Tian’s beloved from the same epoch, a sovereign of that era.

Chapter 1144: The Supreme Confrontation

At Duan Shen Ya, the blood-colored phantom loomed like a sovereign over the heavens. Its chaotic gaze turned toward Zhongli Tian’s altar as the voice echoed.

The hum rose, and divine light rained down. Miaoyin appeared like a celestial being, ascending into the sky amidst the divine glow. Unlike the blood-colored phantom, Miaoyin materialized as a tangible presence before Luo Tian and his companions.

“Is this…” Mingyuan’s eyes widened with fear. He had summoned the projection of a sovereign from the Mortal Era, yet it had drawn forth this terrifying presence. Its aura rivaled even that of the Mortal Era’s ancestral master, if not surpassed it.

“Not a true body!” Two elders at the peak of Sagehood paled, their faces etched with reverence. Regardless of their relationship, they could not show disrespect to a sovereign. This was an ancient rule—no matter if it were a projection, one must still show profound respect. After all, sovereigns embodied the pinnacle of cultivation.

Luo Tian gazed at Miaoyin’s resplendent form in the sky, his face bearing deep reverence. He stood motionless, awaiting developments. He knew now that the situation was beyond his control.

“Sovereigns have never met within the same epoch. We are witnessing two sovereigns—virtual forms, yet an unprecedented sight!” Mingyuan and his companions bore expressions of exhilaration as they gazed at Miaoyin and the Mortal Era’s ancestral master.

“Truly arduous,” Miaoyin mused, a faint smile on her lips. She gazed at the blood-colored phantom, sensing an aura identical to her own—invincible and lonely.

“Regretfully, you are but a projection. I wield a fragment of my true self’s divine essence. In essence, I hold the advantage! Were it not for your catalyst, I would not have appeared!” Miaoyin’s smile deepened as she stood motionless, refraining from action.

“Boom…!” The blood-colored phantom’s eyes flared crimson, launching a torrent of blood qi that churned the skies toward Miaoyin.

Miaoyin’s smile remained undiminished. She conjured a golden ancient zither, its divine laws radiating as she plucked the strings. The music surged like a tempest, sweeping toward the blood-colored vortex.

“This damned mess—your doing!” Luo Tian cursed, glaring at Mingyuan and his companions. The collision of their attacks would surely cost him his life.

“By the gods, I didn’t expect this!” Mingyuan retorted, but the pressure from Miaoyin and the Mortal Era’s ancestral master was overwhelming. Add to that Zhongli Tian’s physical presence, and he could not utter a word.

“Ah?” Miaoyin overheard Luo Tian’s outburst, her gaze shifting toward him. A faint smile graced her lips.

“You… your true self once encountered me. You share Tian Ge’s reincarnation!” Miaoyin addressed Luo Tian, her zither still playing. A thread of divine light spilled from her hands, forming a barrier that shielded Luo Tian and his companions.

Luo Tian exhaled in relief but was awestruck by the sovereign’s power—centuries apart, yet she could still perceive her future self.

Luo Tian and his companions were sealed within the zither’s barrier, unable to sense Miaoyin’s battle with the Mortal Era’s ancestral master. They could only feel divine light colliding against the barrier.

“Seems even your ancestral master’s projection cannot save you!” Luo Tian sneered, clenching his fists. He darted toward Mingyuan and the others, his killing intent palpable.

“Damn it!” Mingyuan and his companions grimaced, staring at Luo Tian’s ferocious charge. They felt the might of his physical form.

At this moment, Mingyuan had no remaining strategies. His greatest safeguard—Ming Shen—was absent. He was but a child before Luo Tian, who stood as a robust adult.

The thunderous clash brought Luo Tian to their side. He struck with both fists toward the two elders at Sage Peak.

“Hold him back! The young master must escape!” The two elders, their faces contorted with frustration, could not evade Luo Tian’s assault.

The elders lunged forward without hesitation, striking toward Luo Tian’s overwhelming fists.

“Crack…!” In an instant, the two elders’ arms exploded, their bodies recoiling. Their eyes reflected profound weakness—repeated injuries had left them at their limit.

Mingyuan seized the opportunity, his gaze filled with resentment as he fled down Duan Shen Ya.

Yet, after a few steps, he halted, his expression filled with despair. Outside the barrier, two sovereigns clashed in an alternate manner. Miaoyin had sealed Luo Tian and his companions within the barrier, leaving Mingyuan trapped beyond it.

“Hmph. A sovereign’s creation—do you think you can break through?” Luo Tian inwardly sneered, his fists raining blows upon the two elders, each strike producing a crackling sound.

“Don’t rush. I’ll finish these two first, then send you to your grave!” Luo Tian’s gaze met Mingyuan’s frozen form before the barrier.

“I won’t die! I still have a life-saving technique!” Mingyuan’s face darkened as he waved his hand, releasing a gray talisman.

“A sovereign’s crafted talisman!” Luo Tian’s mind stirred as he sensed the immense divine laws within the gray talisman.

“Hum…” The gray talisman hummed, releasing waves of gray mist that merged into the void. A fissure appeared before Mingyuan, who cast a resentful glance at Luo Tian.

“Luo Tian, you won’t escape! When my Mortal Era army fully attacks the Nine Realms, that will be your end. I’ll repay every insult you’ve given me a hundredfold!” Mingyuan’s words echoed before he leapt into the fissure, vanishing from Luo Tian’s sight.

“Boom…” Luo Tian crushed one elder with a punch, his碧green flames consuming the body. His gaze was deep as he watched the fissure slowly mend. A surge of desire to chase Mingyuan into it overpowered him, but he restrained himself—what if the fissure led directly to the Mortal Era? He would be doomed.

“Let you live two more days. Next time we meet, I’ll end you!” Luo Tian’s eyes burned with killing intent as he crushed the remaining elder. His gaze was resolute.

Luo Tian gazed at the final elder, now reduced to ashes by the碧晶琉璃火. Five elders at Sage Peak had fallen under his hand.

“Huff…” Luo Tian collapsed to the ground, panting heavily. The heart-pounding journey had left him exhausted.

Five elders at Sage Peak slain—such a feat would be dismissed as Luo Tian’s doing. Had it not been for Duan Shen Ya’s unique environment, even countless lives would not have sufficed to fell five elders at Sage Peak.

“Wonder… how is the situation outside?” Luo Tian’s face bore anticipation, eager to witness the sovereigns’ battle. Though Miaoyin and the blood-colored phantom were not their true selves, their power was no less than a tenth of a sovereign’s. Luo Tian knew it would be earth-shattering.

“Regrettable,” Luo Tian mused, his eyes filled with sorrow. He sat cross-legged on the ground, hoping Miaoyin would prevail. If the blood-colored phantom won, he would still be in grave danger.

Time passed slowly. As Luo Tian waited, even his injuries had nearly healed—but the barrier remained closed.

After another hour, under Luo Tian’s anxious and expectant gaze, the barrier finally began to open. His body tensed instantly, ready to flee at any moment.

Fluctuations surged as劲风 swept through the shattered void, striking Luo Tian’s body with a stinging force. As the barrier opened, his heart relaxed. He gazed at the high altar.

Miaoyin’s form was ethereal, more translucent than before. A soft touch of worry gripped Luo Tian’s heart.

Miaoyin’s phantom stood beside Zhongli Tian on the altar, her eyes gentle as she tenderly caressed his face.

Luo Tian remained still, sensing no immediate danger. He did not wish to disturb the lovers’ reunion—perhaps their final meeting, for even sovereigns could not live through countless epochs.

Luo Tian waited patiently until Miaoyin, sensing his presence, smiled and turned to face him.

“You must know our past. I shall not elaborate further. My time is limited—I cannot exist indefinitely. Perhaps my true self has already perished. This battle has drained me greatly; my divine essence is exhausted. Perhaps this is my final appearance in this world!” Miaoyin’s smile was gentle as she addressed Luo Tian.

Chapter 1145: The Reincarnation’s Crucible

At Duan Shen Ya, Luo Tian bore deep reverence as he listened to Miaoyin’s words.

“Since you are also a reincarnation, it is as if you share the same origin as Tian Ge. In his time, he too possessed the potential of a sovereign. Yet he never ascended to that title because he did not wish to contend with me. I shall grant you a boon, hoping you may one day ascend as a sovereign—fulfilling Tian Ge’s small regret.”

Miaoyin spoke, then extended her hand. A ripple spread from it, and the cliffside of Duan Shen Ya—marked by countless cycles of blood—rose slowly. It radiated immense divinity, ascending toward Luo Tian’s head.

“This blood is the residue from when Tian Ge fought the蛮族 leader and was wounded. For you, it is a great elixir, capable of refining your flesh. If you can extract the essence within this blood, it will greatly benefit your cultivation.” Miaoyin’s expression softened as she infused the blood into Luo Tian’s body.

“Sss…” As the blood entered his body, Luo Tian’s face shifted abruptly.

“Boom…!” A thunderous sound echoed within his body. The divinity embedded in Zhongli Tian’s blood surged through Luo Tian, nearly bursting him apart.

“Refine it!” Luo Tian activated his cultivation technique, sitting cross-legged and fervently refining the blood’s divinity.

At the same time, the blood roamed within his body, refining his meridians and flesh. This was unlike any previous refinement—this time it was internal, causing Luo Tian excruciating pain. It was the most agonizing refinement he had ever endured.

Yet, Luo Tian had to refine both his flesh and the blood’s divine essence—his mind divided between two tasks.

“Good. You can withstand it. I hope you gain insight. This world is different from mine. I wonder if my true self succeeded… If so, perhaps we shall meet again. But the chances are slim. After countless epochs without return, I suspect she has perished.” Miaoyin’s expression carried a faint sorrow.

Luo Tian did not hear Miaoyin’s whispered words, his face drenched in sweat. The immense blood provided him with unparalleled benefits—yet even he could not fully refine its divine essence, wasting much of it.

Yet, Luo Tian was delighted to find that the remaining few strokes of the golden sin character on his back had been completely erased, a minor but significant gain.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian refined for half a month before completing the process. His body felt reborn, radiating terrifying pressure. His divine energy was nearly perfect, ready to break through to Sage Peak.

“Enormous gains! I wonder how powerful I’ll be once I reach Sage Peak!” Luo Tian did not rush to break through. He needed to fully refine the residual divine essence within his body and stabilize himself after breaking free from Tian Dao’s suppression.

“Excellent. I hope you ascend to the pinnacle of this epoch. Zhongli Tian was once unparalleled, a sovereign of his time. Your body now carries his blood. I hope you become invincible in this world!” Miaoyin’s gaze was filled with satisfaction, as if viewing a child.

“Thank you, elder!” Luo Tian’s face bore reverence as he bowed to Zhongli Tian and Miaoyin’s phantom.

“Everything is fate,” Miaoyin softly shook her head, her form growing even more translucent.

“Roar…” A low growl echoed in Luo Tian’s ears. A gray soul-devouring beast appeared before him, ignoring Luo Tian entirely.

It then soared to the altar, kneeling before Zhongli Tian’s body and Miaoyin’s phantom, as if guarding Zhongli Tian.

“After so many years, I didn’t expect this soul-devouring beast to still be alive. Is it due to the immortal herb or Zhongli Tian’s body?” Luo Tian sensed its immense power, comparable to Dongbo Xin.

“This was a soul-devouring beast I and Tian Ge raised together. My true self sealed it within the altar, but it escaped its confinement on its own,” Miaoyin extended her translucent hand, gently stroking the beast’s head.

“Xiaoqi, from now on, you must protect Tian Ge’s body. My divine essence may not return for a long time,” Miaoyin smiled, addressing the beast.

“Roar…” The beast’s fierce head displayed a docile demeanor before Miaoyin, its eyes filled with pleasure as it lay beside Zhongli Tian’s body.

“Enough. My time has come. This epoch is different—remember that!” Miaoyin gazed at the altar below, her eyes filled with concern before vanishing from Luo Tian’s sight.

Luo Tian bowed again, his heart filled with gratitude. He gazed at Zhongli Tian’s altar, Miaoyin’s words echoing in his ears. Especially that final glance left him with a foreboding sense.

Luo Tian had visited the Dragon-Devouring Valley and knew it had changed. This Duan Shen Ya connected to the entrance linked with the蛮族. He feared further changes, for Duan Shen Ya was within the Four Sacred Star Realms.

“Sigh… enough thinking. Only by strengthening my power can I face any changes. The immediate priority is dealing with the Mortal Era’s chaos!” Luo Tian sighed, feeling that future battles would be relentless. Even if prodigies rose, many would perish on the path to becoming a sovereign.

“Going… I wonder how Jiang Xiong is doing. I’ve been here so long—perhaps it’s over by now!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, bowing once more to Zhongli Tian’s body before vanishing into the depths of Duan Shen Ya.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian moved, a red light caught his eye, causing him to frown slightly.

“Ming Shen?” Luo Tian murmured, recalling Ming Shen’s power. A hint of joy crossed his face as he reached for it without hesitation.

“Kid, you’re seeking death!” As Luo Tian’s hand neared Ming Shen, the soul-devouring beast kneeling before Zhongli Tian suddenly opened its eyes.

“Elder, you… can speak!” Luo Tian was startled by the voice, gazing at the soul-devouring beast on the altar.

“Nonsense! Who do you think I am? How could I not speak!” The beast shook its head, voice laced with annoyance.

“If it weren’t for the fact that your body carries your master’s blood, I wouldn’t even bother talking to you. Ming Shen is a weapon forged by a sovereign of the same level as Miaoyin. It possesses formidable self-preservation abilities. If you touch it, you’ll suffer retaliation!” The beast’s tone was cold before it closed its eyes again.

“Sss… what to do?” Luo Tian inhaled sharply, his brow furrowed. Ming Shen was undeniably powerful, but now it could not be taken—this left Luo Tian feeling both vexed and regretful.

“Got it!” After a moment’s thought, Luo Tian’s eyes brightened. He summoned the long-dormant Splitting Heaven Spear.

“Hum…” The spear trembled upon his grasp, emitting a sense of discontent within his mind.

“Alright, I’m calling you out. But whether you succeed depends on your own strength. If you can devour Ming Shen, it will surely aid me in the future!” Luo Tian smiled, addressing the spear.

But as his words ended, the spear trembled with fear, its body quivering in Luo Tian’s grip.

“Scared?” Luo Tian’s smile remained, yet he knew that against Ming Shen—a weapon surpassing even a pseudo-sovereign—Splitting Heaven Spear would be utterly suppressed, like how he himself was crushed by a sovereign.

“Alright, I’ll help you!” Luo Tian murmured, raising his hand. A stream of碧green flames erupted from it, lifting the bloodied battlefield before him.

“Hum…” The fire burned fiercely, and after fusing with the lingering resentment, it seemed to harbor a particular hatred for Ming Shen. The terrifying temperature instantly enveloped Ming Shen.

The blood-red Ming Shen remained invincible, radiating fierce energy without showing signs of refinement.

“Indeed, a weapon forged by a sovereign! Even this cannot refine you!” Luo Tian shook his head, disappointment in his eyes.

感知 (perception) revealed that the evolved碧晶琉璃火 continuously refined the blood-red Ming Shen, but at a painfully slow pace. Luo Tian estimated that it would take at least two years to fully refine it—his estimate was conservative.

“Sigh… I’ll help you then! This is really troublesome!” As Luo Tian prepared to retrieve the碧晶琉璃火 and abandon the effort, a voice echoed in his mind—Ming Shen’s soul-devouring beast.

Gray mist erupted from the beast’s mouth, rushing toward the碧green flames.
