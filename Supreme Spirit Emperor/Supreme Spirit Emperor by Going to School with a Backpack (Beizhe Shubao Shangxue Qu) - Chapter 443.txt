The sound of the explosion was earth-shaking, an invisible wave spreading outward as Luo Tian and his companions bent under its terrifying force.

"Damn it, even without the peak state of an Epoch Master, he's still incredibly strong!" Zhu Ge Qingtian spat blood, his face grim as he gazed at Meng Lingyun standing like a mountain before him. For the first time, a sense of helplessness stirred within his heart.

"Ha! This is real combat!" Yao Chen wiped the blood from his lips before raising his golden staff, charging toward Meng Lingyun. The staff expanded with a thunderous roar, slamming down upon him with immense force.

Faced with Yao Chen's powerful strike, Meng Lingyun remained motionless, raising a single fist. Though simple in appearance, the punch collided with the staff instantly.

"Crack..." The golden staff was shattered from Yao Chen's grasp, and his body flew backward toward Luo Tian's group.

"I'll try too!" Jun Wulei and Wang Wang rushed forward in the same instant, each throwing a punch toward Meng Lingyun.

"Boom... Boom..." The heavy sounds echoed before Meng Lingyun, his body retreating a step as two gray hands seized Jun Wulei and Wang Wang's fists.

Though Meng Lingyun seemed to exert no effort, the two men were spun around and collided with each other.

"Crack..." A sharp sound rang out as Jun Wulei and Wang Wang, their bodies unusually resilient, collided, spewing blood from their mouths.

"Kill..." A storm of blue sky enveloped Zhu Ge Qingtian, who stood beneath a sky of azure lightning. The thunder struck Meng Lingyun's body instantly.

"Buzz..." Meng Lingyun's gray eyes flashed with radiant light as he met the azure lightning. The bolt twisted violently, its power reduced by half upon striking him.

"How is this possible!" Zhu Ge Qingtian's eyes widened in disbelief, but his gaze narrowed as a gray figure appeared before him, seemingly teleporting beyond the red battlefield's suppression. The fist struck Zhu Ge Qingtian's chest with a resounding crack.

Another crack echoed as Zhu Ge Qingtian was sent flying, caught by Long Jie and the others.

"He's too strong! Even after just one round, except for Luo Tian and Run Hongyu, everyone is injured!" Nan Gong Yuqing observed Meng Lingyun standing beside Run Hongyu, speaking softly.

"Even if he's strong, we have to fight. If we die, we can revive outside Star River Domain!" Yan Hongtao spoke, but all knew that even if they revived outside, if Qiu Jingming had mastered the Immortal Tide, his strength would reach a terrifying level. With Meng Lingyun's current state, neither the Nine Realms nor the Ancient Clans would stand a chance against Qiu Jingming.

"Boom..." As they discussed, Run Hongyu spat blood and fell to the ground in a clumsy manner.

"Luo Tian!" As Run Hongyu flew backward, he shouted toward Luo Tian, noticing something was amiss with his state.

"Buzz..." A humming sound filled the air as Run Hongyu's words were barely spoken when waves of energy erupted before Luo Tian. Meng Lingyun's aged face appeared before him, his gray eyes devoid of emotion, launching a powerful punch toward Luo Tian.

"Brother!" Seeing Luo Tian under attack, Long Jie grew anxious, transforming into a golden light and his true form. His golden dragon tail lashed toward Luo Tian.

The golden dragon tail became a blur, leaving a trail of gold before colliding with Meng Lingyun's fist.

"Boom..." Blood mist spread as the golden dragon tail exploded before Luo Tian, splattering his body with golden dragon blood.

"Luo Tian, he's not your master! He's just a puppet controlled by Qiu Jingming!" Zhou Wei shouted at Luo Tian.

"Yes, I know!" Luo Tian nodded gently as he watched Long Jie, pale-faced and weak.

"Master is truly strong! He's far stronger than when he sealed the Demon Realm. If he fully recovers, how strong would he be?" Luo Tian muttered, watching Meng Lingyun's fist approach again. Golden runes flowed across his arm as he punched back.

The collision revealed Meng Lingyun's strength instantly. Even with Luo Tian's monstrous physique, he felt overwhelmed, his feet scraping the crimson stone as he flew backward. Though worse than others, he fared better.

"His physique is变态!" Jun Wulei and Wang Wang's faces showed shock, stunned that Luo Tian had withstood Meng Lingyun's punch.

"That kid is the Nine Body Types' Reincarnation Body!" Zhu Ge Qingtian wiped his lips, standing up slowly with a solemn gaze toward Meng Lingyun.

"Reincarnation Body!" Upon hearing Zhu Ge Qingtian's words, Jun Wulei's face turned pale. His father, the Heavenly Sky Lord, was also a Reincarnation Body, and he knew its terrifying power.

As they marveled, Meng Lingyun moved again, but this time not toward them. His hands flared with energy as a gray shadow enveloped him.

"Ruler of the World!" Luo Tian's face darkened upon seeing the shadow.

Chapter 1727: Meng Lingyun's Power

"Ruler of the World," Meng Lingyun's signature technique, created when he became an Epoch Master. This move was beyond Luo Tian's ability, as only an Epoch Master could wield it.

"Buzz..." Supreme energy merged with Meng Lingyun's body, and a gray great sword materialized, emitting an ancient killing sound.

"Your mother! When we fought the Demon Realm, your master wasn't this strong!" Seeing the gray figure with a killing sword, Meng Lingyun's eyes were cold.

"Can't block it!" Everyone was stunned by Meng Lingyun's overwhelming attack, feeling like insignificant mortals before heaven.

"What to do?" Their hearts trembled as they exchanged glances, finally focusing on Luo Tian. Among them, only Luo Tian truly understood Meng Lingyun.

"No solution," Luo Tian's eyes showed a bitter smile, wiping his lips as he gazed at Meng Lingyun's sky-swallowing aura.

"Buzz..." As they panicked, Meng Lingyun swung his killing sword toward Jun Wulei and Wang Wang.

"One Strike to Sever the Heavens!" The gray sword beam, controlling life and death, reached them instantly.

"One Strike to Sever the Heavens!" Wang Wang roared, his pressure immense but not yet forcing him to surrender. His long sword glowed with a brilliant light, slicing outward.

"Sever the Heavens!" Jun Wulei shouted, his hands forming two massive fists. He grasped the sky with both hands, maintaining a sword-holding posture as he clashed against the gray blade.

"Crack..."
"Pu..." In an instant, Jun Wulei and Wang Wang's faces turned pale. Wang Wang's long sword was shattered instantly, while Jun Wulei's arm exploded.

The gray sword struck their bodies, blood splattering as white bones pierced through their flesh. This strike nearly severed them in half.

"Buzz..." Seeing the sword hadn't killed Wang Wang and Jun Wulei, Meng Lingyun's eyes flashed with more gray light. The killing sword swung again, a blade of judgment over life and death, striking Wang Wang and Jun Wulei as they struggled to recover.

"Still watching? Come help!" Wang Wang roared, seeing the gray blade expand in his eyes. A powerful sense of crisis invaded his mind.

"Such bad luck! Just coming out, I met this变态!" Wang Wang cursed inwardly. He then spat a mouthful of blood, forming a crimson seal over his body. At the same time, vibrant vitality surged from him, rapidly healing his wounds.

"Block it!" Luo Tian's eyes flashed with determination. He knew Jun Wulei and Wang Wang couldn't die; if they did, their side would lose two powerful allies.

Luo Tian's body flickered, appearing before Jun Wulei and Wang Wang instantly. At the same time, Run Hongyu and Yao Chen launched their attacks. They knew confronting the killing sword was hopeless; instead, they attacked directly. If they could injure Meng Lingyun, it would ease their pressure.

Meanwhile, Long Jie, Zhou Wei, and Yan Hongtao who had just arrived also launched their attacks. A series of martial arts flew from their hands, striking Meng Lingyun.

"Buzz..." A golden spear hovered above Luo Tian's head as the gray sword descended, colliding with it.

"Crack..." The red battlefield trembled as thunder crackled. Golden spear images flew from Luo Tian's hands, and his arms emitted a series of cracks.

"Even Luo Tian with an Epoch Treasure can't withstand it!" Everyone's eyes showed despair. They hadn't expected Meng Lingyun, revived, to be so powerful.

"Cough... cough..." Luo Tian's massive body bent instantly, crimson ground marred by deep cracks.

"An Epoch Master can withstand an Epoch Treasure. If this Epoch Master weren't a puppet, that strike would have killed us three!" Jun Wulei stood behind Luo Tian, gazing at the overwhelming shadow.

At the same time, Long Jie and others' attacks struck Meng Lingyun's front, their martial arts radiating immense power.

"Boom... Boom... Boom..." Thunderous sounds echoed, terrifying waves overturning the crimson sky. Golden waves rolled before Meng Lingyun, divine laws flowing to obscure their vision.

"You guys take down Qiu Jingming!" Luo Tian exhaled deeply, regaining sensation in his arms as blood flowed down. The golden crackling spear returned from afar, landing in Luo Tian's hands.

"What about you..." Long Jie looked at Luo Tian, pale-faced. They understood Luo Tian's meaning: they would hold Meng Lingyun back while Long Jie and others killed Qiu Jingming. After all, Qiu Jingming was the key.

"It's okay, go!" Luo Tian nodded, clenching his fists as he gazed at Meng Lingyun standing again.

"Master, I didn't expect you to be so strong! You really did me in!" Luo Tian's eyes held a bitter smile before he rushed toward Meng Lingyun.

Yao Chen, Run Hongyu, Jun Wulei, and Wang Wang also flickered their bodies, attacking Meng Lingyun from different directions.

"Kill..." Long Jie growled, trusting Luo Tian, and rushed toward Qiu Jingming.

"Awaken! The Soul of the Epoch Master!" Seeing Long Jie's group approaching, Qiu Jingming smiled coldly. He pointed his finger, and the four Epoch Treasures hovering above him emitted a buzzing sound. Powerful waves spread from the four supreme treasures.

"This old monster still has tricks!" Yan Hongtao cursed, summoning the Shura Domain's Shura Blade.

Long Jie also unleashed the Demon Emperor, while Zhou Wei's Star Tower hovered above his head. Zhu Ge Qingtian summoned the Chaos Bell. The four Epoch Treasures radiated powerful waves, emitting supreme energy as they confronted Qiu Jingming's treasures.

"Buzz..." The four supreme treasures above Qiu Jingming buzzed, emitting gray mist that formed four human-shaped shadows before Long Jie's group. A solemn aura radiated from the figures.

"That's my race's Epoch Master! Is he reviving four Epoch Masters again!" Nan Gong Yuqing's face showed disbelief, staring at the figure emerging from the Demon Emperor Blade.

"No, he's fully awakening the Epoch Treasures, releasing the residual souls of the Epoch Masters within them!" Zhou Wei spoke softly, his gaze solemn.

"Correct. Though strong, he's still far behind your master! Facing your master, I felt like an ordinary person!" Long Jie spoke, then activated the Demon Emperor Mirror to strike the four shadows.

Yan Hongtao and others also activated their treasures, clashing with the four figures. Destroying heavens and earth waves echoed again. If not for the red battlefield's suppression, their battle would have caused a stir in the Nine Realms or even obliterated a star realm.

"Boom..." Luo Tian, bloodied and battered, continuously resisted Meng Lingyun's sword beams. Each collision made his face paler. It was only Luo Tian's monstrous physique that allowed him to endure, but he felt he couldn't last much longer.

Though wounded, Yao Chen, Wang Wang, Jun Wulei, and Zhu Ge Qingtian's attacks continuously struck Meng Lingyun. Though his body was unparalleled, they weren't pushovers either. Cracks formed on Meng Lingyun's body, gray mist seeping out as his aura weakened slightly.

"Push harder! Kill him!" Wang Wang shouted, Luo Tian drawing most of Meng Lingyun's pressure, so their burden was lighter.

"Pushing what? I'm almost done!" Luo Tian shouted, stepping out of the deep crater, breathing heavily.

"Someone take over! I need a break!" Luo Tian shouted at them, feeling his body and soul were nearly torn apart.

"I'll take over!" Jun Wulei shouted, spitting a mouthful of golden blood. A crimson seal formed over his body, merging into him as golden light surged through it.

"I've activated my Reincarnation Body's bloodline. My physique rivals a fully matured Reincarnation Body, but I can't last long!" Jun Wulei shouted at Luo Tian's group before transforming into a streak of light, taking Meng Lingyun's killing sword.

"Kill..." Seeing Jun Wulei replace Luo Tian, Wang Wang and others launched powerful attacks toward Meng Lingyun.

"Ugh..." Luo Tian exhaled deeply, his body trembling as he gazed at the battlefield.

Chapter 1728: The Collapse of the Immortal Tide

Luo Tian observed the battlefield. Jiang Nanxuan's group was manageable; though the revived elites were strong, Jiang Nanxuan and Sun Mengru could still handle them. Except for those who had died in the trial, twenty or so near-Epoch Masters remained. Though the Nine Realms' people were injured, no deaths had occurred yet.

Meanwhile, Long Jie and Nan Gong Yuqing's battle was equally fierce. Four supreme shadows, wielding four supreme treasures, continuously attacked to block Long Jie's group.

"Think of a plan!" Luo Tian, recovering his injuries, gazed at Qiu Jingming standing outside the battle.

Residual souls accompanied by spiritual energy appeared before Qiu Jingming, constantly being absorbed. The Immortal Tide's towering column trembled, its spiritual energy dwindling. Qiu Jingming's aura grew stronger, making Luo Tian feel a sense of alarm. He knew Qiu Jingming was the key.

"He's too strong!" Though solemn, Luo Tian admired Qiu Jingming's power. Alone, he had held them all back, his methods transcendent. In Luo Tian's view, Qiu Jingming was the top among Epoch Masters.

Though it seemed evenly matched, they were barely holding on. After so long, they hadn't defeated Meng Lingyun but instead struggled to endure.

"Sky Will Thunder Sword!" Luo Tian had no choice but to unleash his strongest attack, regardless of whether it was recognized by the others.

"Crackling... " Three-colored lightning surrounded the Sky Will Thunder Sword as it appeared, causing residual souls in the red battlefield to tremble slightly. They felt an immense suppression from it.

"Damn, that's the sword! It absorbed my lightning!" In a small room, Longtail Lizard swished its tail, eyes filled with anger as it watched the battle.

"This kid's good!" Longtail Lizard, standing beside several elders, whispered among themselves.

"Watch. Everything must follow the rules!" The Star River Domain's artifact spirit smiled, watching the scene.

"Buzz..." Epoch energy flowed into the Sky Will Thunder Sword as Luo Tian shouted at Yao Chen's group: "Give me your spiritual energy!"

"This..." Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, Zhu Ge Qingtian paused mid-attack. They had just absorbed some spiritual energy; giving it up made them reluctant.

"Buzz..." Yao Chen pointed his finger, unconcerned. The spiritual energy he had absorbed in the Immortal Tide erupted from his hand, rushing into Luo Tian's Sky Will Thunder Sword.

"Quickly!" Seeing their hesitation, Luo Tian shouted urgently. With Yao Chen's spiritual energy infused, the Sky Will Thunder Sword suddenly expanded, emitting a powerful pressure.

"What?" The residual souls battling Jiang Nanxuan's group were startled, then saw the Sky Will Thunder Sword expanding in Luo Tian's hand.

At this moment, the Sky Will Thunder Sword, infused with Yao Chen's spiritual energy, appeared even more extraordinary. It stood like a thunderclap in Luo Tian's hand.

"Is this an immortal weapon?" Jiang Nanxuan and others stared in awe at the Sky Will Thunder Sword, surprised to find such a treasure in the Three Thousand Small Realms. Even in the Immortal Realm, inferior immortal treasures were considered supreme, often fought over by Heaven-Realm masters.

"Where have I seen this sword before?" Ma Xiuzhen's eyes showed confusion, a memory stirring.

"I remember!" His face then showed intense fear, recalling an event that had caused turmoil in the Immortal Realm years ago. That incident spread from the Upper Three Realms to the Lower Three Realms.

"Sky Will Thunder Sword!" Ma Xiuzhen exclaimed, his body trembling as he stared at Luo Tian's thunderclap sword. He even forgot to counter the attack against him.

"What!" Upon hearing Ma Xiuzhen's words, Jiang Nanxuan and others showed disbelief. Those who had participated in the Star River Domain's trial were from the Middle Three Realms. Though their families weren't significant in the Immortal Realm, they had experienced its changes.

Nine Immortal Kings, the Fallen Heaven King's weapon was destroyed by the Eternal Life King. This event was known throughout the Immortal Realm. Afterward, the Eternal Life King sent people to hunt down the Fallen Heaven King's descendants and disciples. However, they failed to catch the disciple who had escaped with the Sky Will Thunder Sword and the Fallen Heaven King's daughter.

The Sky Will Thunder Sword was renowned in the Immortal Realm! Everyone knew it was the weapon of the Fallen Heaven King, one of the Nine Immortal Kings.

Thus, when the Eternal Life King's people hunted down the Fallen Heaven King's descendants, others also chased them to seize the Sky Will Thunder Sword. This event lasted over a decade in the Immortal Realm.

Eventually, the Fallen Heaven King's descendant disappeared, and the Sky Will Thunder Sword was also lost. People thought the Eternal Life King had obtained it. Jiang Nanxuan and others never expected to encounter this legendary treasure in the Star River Domain's trial.

"Sky Will Thunder Sword!" The elders sitting in the small room showed wild changes, even the Star River Domain's artifact spirit displayed shock.

"What to do?" One elder asked, gazing at the artifact spirit. The Star River Domain was in the Middle Three Realms but was far beneath the Upper Three Realms' Nine Immortal Mountains. If the Eternal Life King wished, a single word would summon countless strong warriors to destroy the Star River Domain.

"This kid can't be left alive! If the Eternal Life King learns we're connected to him, it will bring disaster to our Star River Domain!" One elder spoke, standing up slowly with a killing aura. This elder was the red battlefield's overseer.

"We're in the Three Thousand Small Realms now, though we don't know why we ended up here. I don't want to stay here forever!" Another elder replied, his eyes flashing with light.

"I never feared the heavenly trials! It's because of this legendary Sky Will Thunder Sword!" Longtail Lizard shook its head, watching the Sky Will Thunder Sword's power growing in Luo Tian's hand.

"Let's watch. This kid's luck is great; he might be our chance to return to the Immortal Realm!"

"It's fate, not misfortune. If it were misfortune, it wouldn't have come to this. The Sky Will Thunder Sword was clearly damaged; otherwise, it wouldn't be so weak! But rules can't change!"

"Moreover, this kid's situation is dangerous. That golden-robed youth isn't simple either. If he survives this, we'll take the gamble!" The Star River Domain's artifact spirit pondered for a while before shaking its head.

Immortal power surged, azure light illuminating Luo Tian's face. Seeing Yao Chen infusing spiritual energy into the Sky Will Thunder Sword, Wang Wang and Zhu Ge Qingtian also infused their spiritual energy. The sword radiated a destructive aura, surpassing all beings.

"Forgive me, master!" Luo Tian whispered before raising the Sky Will Thunder Sword over his head. He shouted at Yao Chen's group: "Get out of the way!"

"One Strike to Sever Heaven!" Luo Tian's deep voice echoed as the azure sword beam flew toward Meng Lingyun.

"Buzz..." Time froze, the azure blade sweeping across the world, leaving only this single beam. It broke through time's constraints, annihilating all in its path.

As the world-shattering blade reached Meng Lingyun's body, he moved. His Slaying Sword was raised high, surrounded by countless gray spiritual patterns.

"Crack..." The battlefield trembled as the two collided, resembling an apocalypse.

Power surged outward, countless residual souls disintegrating in the powerful aftermath, turning into gray mist that enveloped the entire red battlefield.

Silence fell over the battlefield as figures stood up, their faces filled with fear. They exchanged glances, seeing terror in each other's eyes but saying nothing.

"Boom..." However, as they marveled, the surging spiritual energy finally couldn't withstand it. It burst apart with a thunderous roar, sending waves of spiritual energy across the sky. Soon, it dispersed the gray mist that had enveloped the world.

"Block it!" Luo Tian's pale face spoke as his crackling spear hovered above him, shielding everyone from the spiritual energy erupting from the Immortal Tide.

"Big brother!" Long Jie and others quickly regrouped with Luo Tian, gazing at the scattered spiritual energy with solemn expressions.

"Did you kill your master?" Yao Chen and others, battered, approached Luo Tian's side under the radiant light. Their eyes showed admiration.

"If a true Epoch Master could block it, but your master's state was clearly off; he might have been killed!" Wang Wang spoke, gazing at Luo Tian. He never expected Luo Tian to master such a powerful technique.

"Kid, you've surprised me!" A cold voice echoed as Qiu Jingming stood beneath four Epoch Treasures, gazing at Luo Tian across the distance. His eyes showed intense fear. Before him stood Meng Lingyun, his eyes vacant but covered in divine marks.

"Still, thank you for breaking the Immortal Tide. Otherwise, I'd have spent much effort!" Qiu Jingming smiled, watching the spiritual energy swirling in the sky. He spoke to Luo Tian.

Chapter 1729: The Arrival of the Three-Headed Dog

"Roar..." Roars echoed as residual souls surrounded Qiu Jingming, rushing toward the spiritual energy.

Though Luo Tian's clash with Meng Lingyun had annihilated countless residual souls, some remained. Additionally, the gray mist formed by previously destroyed souls quickly reassembled, appearing as an immortal entity.

"Still need to block it!" Luo Tian's pale face spoke, their current states were poor. Fortunately, only Qiu Jingming and Meng Lingyun remained now; the previously revived elites had been reduced to a few, most dying in the previous aftermath.

"Kill..." Luo Tian held the Sky Will Thunder Sword, his pale face as he rushed toward Qiu Jingming.

Others also moved forward. Things were better than expected; although Meng Lingyun hadn't been killed, they could feel his aura had weakened. He no longer felt invincible.

"Damn it!" Qiu Jingming's face darkened as he pointed, and Meng Lingyun stood before him again, a mountain-like barrier. To kill Qiu Jingming, they had to eliminate Meng Lingyun first.

"Endless Sword!" Luo Tian roared, moving with his sword toward Meng Lingyun. Others also unleashed martial arts, attacking Meng Lingyun.

"Buzz..." The Slaying Sword reformed as Meng Lingyun's aura surged again, raising the sword to strike Luo Tian who had approached.

"Crack..." A sharp sound rang out as Luo Tian's body flew backward, his palm torn.

"At least he's stronger than before!" Luo Tian wiped the blood from his lips, realizing after a brief clash that Meng Lingyun's strength had significantly declined.

"Buzz..." As Luo Tian marveled, Meng Lingyun's sword continuously swung, and Wang Wang and others' attacks struck his body. Meng Lingyun's body retreated.

After a brief silence, thunderous sounds echoed again in the red battlefield. Meng Lingyun wielded his Slaying Sword, battling against the Nine Realms' elites. The sword continuously fell, bringing immense pressure. Though no longer invincible, it was difficult for them to eliminate Meng Lingyun quickly.

The scene once again stalled as they surrounded Meng Lingyun, no longer as simple as before when fighting Qiu Jingming's revived elites. Soon, some couldn't hold on, breathing heavily with blood covering their bodies.

But it wasn't without effect; Meng Lingyun's speed and power were gradually consumed by them.

"Yell..." A scream echoed as Zheng Xin was unable to hold on, being sliced in two by Meng Lingyun.

"Zheng Xin, don't revive here! Go out!" Luo Tian watched Zheng Xin die in the red battlefield. Though he knew Zheng Xin wouldn't truly perish, his heart still felt uneasy.

"Buzz..." Zheng Xin's figure vanished from their sight. At this point, Luo Tian's group had finally suffered casualties.

This was just the beginning; Meng Lingyun's body was covered in gray mist, his gray robe stained with blood.

The second death was Xu Liyi, who cursed as he was sliced into a mist of blood and vanished from the red battlefield.

Gu Lei, Sun Kelnian, and others were also killed by Meng Lingyun. Seeing his comrades die one after another, Luo Tian grew anxious and shouted: "Don't fight anymore!"

It wasn't that Luo Tian believed he could withstand it; it was simply unbearable to watch his friends be sliced into mist, and the attacker was his own master.

"Ugh..." Hearing Luo Tian's words, Diao Dezhu and Leng Qiuchan struggled to breathe, exiting the battlefield. They regrouped with Jiang Nanxuan to fight the remaining elites revived by Qiu Jingming.

Luo Tian's group also clashed with Meng Lingyun again, but they were once more subdued. As the battle continued, although Meng Lingyun's attacks still caused damage to Luo Tian's group, it was within their capacity.

"Buzz..." However, Qiu Jingming's aura grew stronger, his body radiating light. Divine laws flowed through him as residual souls waited around him.

"What to do? Once we kill your master, those spiritual energies might be absorbed by that old man!" Jun Wulei spoke anxiously.

"Ha! You don't have a chance. Once I finish absorbing these spiritual energies, it'll be your end!" Qiu Jingming stood among residual souls, gazing at Luo Tian's group with amusement. At this moment, he felt incredibly powerful, a sense of breakthrough rising within him. He felt as if a barrier was holding him back; once he absorbed the spiritual energy and transformed his dantian, he could achieve enlightenment.

"Roar..." However, as Qiu Jingming pondered his bright future, a low roar echoed through the world. A fierce aura spread into Luo Tian's minds.

"This is!" Luo Tian felt a familiar sound, his face slightly changing. He felt it was familiar and then felt joy.

"Boom... Boom..." A massive object like a black tower rushed from afar, three fierce heads with silver eyes glowing coldly.

"Little Black!" Luo Tian felt joy; he hadn't expected Little Black to arrive at the red battlefield. The arrival of the Three-Headed Dog added a major support for Luo Tian, at least in his view. The Three-Headed Dog's monstrous physique could serve as a good shield.

"Growl... Growl..." The Three-Headed Dog approached Luo Tian, surprising everyone. The residual souls in the world felt fear toward it, even parting a path for it to run directly to Luo Tian.

"Three-Headed Dog of Hell!" In the small room, Star River Domain's artifact spirit showed disbelief, gazing at the massive Three-Headed Dog in the lake.

"What kind of creature is this, existing within the Three Thousand Small Realms!" Others also spoke in shock, gazing at the fierce yet docile Three-Headed Dog before Luo Tian.

"Does this kid have some connection with Hell?" The artifact spirit spoke solemnly, sensing Luo Tian was not simply a talent from the Three Thousand Small Realms.

"Little Black, play later. Work first!" Luo Tian spoke to the Three-Headed Dog before gazing at Qiu Jingming standing in the soul.

Qiu Jingming's mind tensed as the Three-Headed Dog appeared, a bad feeling rising within him.

"Growl... Growl..." The Three-Headed Dog barked at Luo Tian twice before its silver eyes gazed at the residual souls scattered across the world. Its mouth drooled, eyes showing desire.

"Want it?" Luo Tian felt the Three-Headed Dog's desire. If not for his presence, it would have rushed out without hesitation.

"Then go!" Luo Tian spoke to the Three-Headed Dog. At this moment, those residual souls were indeed a problem, constantly interfering with Jiang Nanxuan's group.

"Roar..." Hearing Luo Tian's permission, the Three-Headed Dog shook its head, silver eyes showing excitement. The three massive heads roared toward the sky.

A roar shook the world, invisible whirlwinds emerging from the three blood-red mouths of the Three-Headed Dog. A violent suction instantly made the gray residual souls tremble, then uncontrollably converged toward the Three-Headed Dog.

"Buzz..." Residual souls rushed into the three heads of the Three-Headed Dog without hesitation, being swallowed by it in large quantities.

An extraordinary scene formed on the red battlefield as gray residual souls were devoured at a terrifying speed.
