"Lo Tian!" Fu Xingyue and the others shouted, watching as the storm clouds dissipated. They flew toward Lo Tian's position, supporting him as he rose to his feet.

"I'm fine..." Lo Tian spoke, wiping the sweat from his forehead. His gaze carried a sense of awe. Though he had endured three heavenly punishments, the black demon within his dantian was now more refined than ever, sitting in perfect stillness like a true Lo Tian.

"Lo Tian, why are you practicing the Mind Demon Scripture upside down?" Fu Xingyue asked, his eyes narrowing at Lo Tian's reckless determination.

"I didn't expect to trigger a thunderstorm so soon..." Lo Tian said, "The next storm will be the sixth. Ninety-nine days from now - I need to prepare. If this continues, I'll be worn out eventually!"

Lo Tian's voice carried a note of grim humor. He was but a hair away from becoming a half-step Immortal King.

"Let's return first to regrow your legs. We'll leave now," Zhou Zhiwen said, a faint smile on his face. Though the journey through the Demon Forest had been perilous, their rewards matched the risk.

"Right," Lo Tian nodded, his gaze turning to Fu Xingyue. "Give me the Huanmo Stone."

"Come on, you're injured! I'll keep it for you," Fu Xingyue protested, clearly trying to avoid handing over the artifact.

"You'll report me to Xuanxuan, won't you?" Lo Tian sneered, seizing Fu Xingyue's weakness - and his own.

"Smart move..." Fu Xingyue sighed, knowing Lo Tian's status as a demon cultivator made the Huanmo Stone potentially valuable. With a flick of his hand, he sent the stone floating toward Lo Tian.

Lo Tian picked up the Huanmo Stone, casting a glance at Gu Qianxue before securing it around his neck.

Gu Qianxue let out a cold hum, saying nothing but feeling her face flush and her chest grow warm.

"Let's go," Zhou Zhiwen said, watching Lo Tian tuck the stone away. He said nothing about teaching him the Dao of Mind Seeding.

They took flight, Fu Xingyue pushing Lo Tian's cart as they exited the cave. The sky had brightened, perhaps due to the Huanmo Stone's removal.

Lo Tian's group felt their burdens lighten. They rushed into the forest, now free of illusions and moving far more smoothly than before. After an hour's journey, they emerged at the edge of the Demon Forest.

"Wait," Lo Tian frowned as they exited. He had ordered Fu Xiyang to wait outside, but no one was there.

"What's going on? Where's my brother?" Fu Xingyue panicked, scanning the area. No signs of struggle or disturbance.

"Where's Fu Bei?" Zhou Zhiwen asked, suddenly remembering Fu Bei.

"No idea," the group replied in unison, exchanging glances.

"Let's return to Jiutian City first," Lo Tian said grimly. Fu Xingyue's urgency was futile without direction.

They accelerated, streaks of light flying toward Jiutian City. After hours of travel, they returned.

"Master Lo, rest for a while," Zhou Zhiwen said as he led them to the city's governor's mansion. "I'll send someone to investigate and summon an Immortal King to restore your leg."

"Don't worry," Lo Tian comforted Fu Xingyue, suppressing his own anxiety. "It's unlikely a ten thousand people could vanish without a trace."

"Something's wrong," Gu Qianxue said suddenly, her black ghost eyes flickering. "A few people are coming this way - and they're strong. One's even at the middle stage of Immortal King."

"Did he come to restore my leg?" Lo Tian frowned at Gu Qianxue.

"It doesn't seem so. If he wanted to restore your leg, a lower-stage Immortal King would have sufficed. And Zhou Zhiwen isn't with him," Gu Qianxue replied.

"Could it be Zhou Zhiwen's betrayal?" Hun Xuan asked, now bound to Lo Tian's fate. Lo Tian couldn't afford any accidents.

Chapter 2336: Fu Tianhan

"Let's go," as Hun Xuan's words ended, a voice echoed in Lo Tian's mind - just one word: "Go." Then silence. A shadow fell over Lo Tian's heart.

"Let's hide first. Don't resist," Lo Tian said cautiously, sending a wave of energy over Fu Xingyue and Gu Qianxue.

"Buzz..." The energy surged, and the three vanished from sight, appearing on the Butian Stone.

"Kid, you really think I'm just a worthless stone? Anyone can use me..." The Butian Stone protested, making Lo Tian blush.

"What is this..." Hun Xuan's group turned pale, staring at the crimson earth. Their expressions held disbelief.

As they vanished, several figures appeared in their former courtyard. A powerful presence made Lo Tian's group feel immediate danger.

"Where are they?" A middle-aged man barked, his gaze sharp. His cultivation was clearly at the middle stage of Immortal King, and his voice shook the courtyard.

"Middle-stage Immortal King!" Lo Tian frowned, recognizing the man's features but unable to place him.

"Second brother, those kids must be nearby. I'll check the surroundings," another middle-aged man said coldly, his cultivation at the early stage of Immortal King.

"Middle-stage Immortal King and early-stage Immortal King. Two half-step Immortal Kings," Lo Tian mused, impressed by their strength.

"Eastern Palace of the Celestial Emperor - Fu Tianhan," Gu Qianxue's voice echoed in Lo Tian's mind, shaking him.

"So soon? The Eternal Life Mountain didn't come, but the Eastern Palace did!" Lo Tian hadn't expected the Eastern Palace's retaliation to arrive so quickly.

He signaled everyone not to move, fearing Fu Tianhan would discover them. If found, he'd have no chance of escape.

No one dared to breathe. After Gu Qianxue's transmission, she said nothing more. Fu Tianhan stood silently, waiting.

Time passed slowly. Half an hour later, the man who had claimed to search for Lo Tian returned, his face filled with frustration.

"Uncle, we didn't find them!" The middle-aged man said, confusion in his voice. They had sealed Jiutian City after learning of Lo Tian's arrival, preventing even a fly from escaping. Yet he had scoured the city and found nothing.

"Killing my nephew - no matter where you run, you won't escape!"

"Spread the word. Let that killer come to my Eastern Palace. If he doesn't show up in a day, I'll kill one of them each day!" Fu Tianhan said coldly, his hand reaching out. The void shattered, and a figure appeared in the courtyard.

The figure wore the attire of the Star Domain. His face showed fear - they had barely left the Demon Forest when these terrifying people captured them.

No resistance. The Star Domain's leader couldn't even block a single hand, and was captured instantly.

"Boom..." Blood mist sprayed across the ground. Coincidentally, the blood landed on the spot where Lo Tian's group was hiding, splattering onto their faces.

Fu Xingyue's face turned red, his breath ragged. His eyes were wide but held by Yin Xiu and Hun Xuan.

"I don't know if this trick will work. If these people are his accomplices, they should show up," Fu Tianhan muttered, looking into the distance.

"Fu Bei is dead!" The group's hearts sank. Fu Tianhan's words carried undeniable evidence.

Yin Xiu and the others turned their gazes to Lo Tian. Among them, only Lo Tian had a grudge against Fu Bei - making him the prime suspect.

Lo Tian's eyes burned red. His hands gripped the golden cart's handle, deforming it. He stared at the middle-aged man, his killing intent raging.

Lo Tian hated seeing others die because of him. But now one had died before his eyes, and more would follow daily. He restrained the urge to charge out - he knew it would be suicide, no way to save anyone.

"Alright, let's go. If this doesn't work, we'll think of another plan," Fu Tianhan said, walking out of the courtyard after killing the man.

"What now?" Fu Xingyue's eyes were bloodshot, his gaze on Lo Tian. He didn't blame Lo Tian, but was now confused - the people taken weren't just Star Domain's core members, but his own brother Fu Xiyang.

"Find a way. We must save them. So many people - they couldn't have been taken. I'll avenge this!" Lo Tian roared, sending the Butian Stone out of the courtyard. He needed a secluded spot to release Hun Xuan and Jie Du, who were disciples of the Nine Great Mountains. Fu Tianhan wouldn't dare harm them.

But as Lo Tian's group floated past the courtyard gate, a figure hurried over - none other than Zhou Zhiwen, who had just left.

Lo Tian frowned, transmitting to Zhou Zhiwen while sending a wave of energy over him. Zhou Zhiwen appeared on the Butian Stone.

"What's going on?" Zhou Zhiwen gasped, Fu Xingyue grabbing his neck with violent intent.

"Fu Brother, please let go. Let me explain..." Zhou Zhiwen struggled for breath, addressing Fu Xingyue's bloodshot eyes.

"Let go!" Lo Tian said. Though he had regained composure, his expression was terrifying - Hun Xuan and Yin Xiu dared not speak.

Fu Xingyue didn't respond, releasing Zhou Zhiwen. His gaze was fierce toward him.

"Master Lo, I'm sorry. The Eastern Palace's people arrived and predicted one of us killed Fu Bei. But they don't know who it was, so Fu Tianhan and others waited outside the Demon Forest for us."

"They didn't expect to find you friends, so they captured them, thinking it was these people who killed Fu Bei."

"When we returned, Fu Tianhan hadn't been back long. Now your friends are imprisoned in Jiutian City."

"But Fu Tianhan has ordered our Central Heaven Consortium's high-ranking members to spread the word. You don't show up in a day, and they'll kill one of them each day."

"Our Central Heaven Consortium is under the Nine Great Mountains. Though they give us face, we have to comply with Fu Tianhan's orders. Please forgive Master Lo," Zhou Zhiwen said, his voice carrying apology.

"Ah, I hope you don't leak my information..." Lo Tian said softly. No one could tell what he was thinking.

"Don't worry, I'll go to the Ghost King Sect to get reinforcements!" Gu Qianxue said softly.

"Thank you. You don't need to get involved," Lo Tian replied, guiding the Butian Stone out of Jiutian City. A flash of light, and they appeared outside the stone.

"Everyone, I hope you keep this secret," Lo Tian said softly. He wasn't worried about them spreading his hidden techniques - he just wanted to be extra cautious.

"Master Lo, I'll return to the sect and try to get strong sect elders to help you through this crisis," Yin Xiu said, his gaze filled with admiration.

"Master, I'll go get help for you," Hun Xuan said. If Lo Tian died, his cultivation would be lost too.

"Master Lo, I'll go make them turn back," Jie Du said, his eyes determined. He had that compassionate habit again.

"Jie Du, you... don't be reckless. This isn't something you can solve!" Lo Tian sighed longingly, surprised by Jie Du's actions. But he knew Jie Du wouldn't be of much help.

"Wait for me!" Gu Qianxue looked at Lo Tian deeply before flying off. She knew her strength wouldn't help, only relying on the Ghost King Sect behind her.

Yin Xiu and Hun Xuan also bowed and left. Whether they would help or not, Lo Tian didn't know - he wasn't counting on them.

"Master Lo, I think you should return to Butian Mountain and get one or two Immortal Kings to resolve this," Zhou Zhiwen hesitated. This matter was too big; even as the next会长 of Central Heaven Consortium, he couldn't handle it.

"Master Zhou, thank you for warning me before. I know what to do. Perhaps I'll ask for your help later - please don't refuse," Lo Tian said, transmitting the Dao of Mind Seeding's incantation to Zhou Zhiwen. This was their prior agreement; Lo Tian wouldn't break it.

"By the way, Master Lo's friend Fu Xiyang is safe. His bloodline seems special - Fu Tianhan has taken him to the Eastern Palace," Zhou Zhiwen said before leaving, making Lo Tian and Fu Xingyue's faces darken.

"What bloodline?" Lo Tian frowned. He knew Fu Xiyang and Fu Xingyue were of royal blood, but that was in the Nine Realms. In the Immortal Realm, it probably didn't count.

"So there's only one Immortal King and two half-step Immortal Kings in Jiutian City?" But then Lo Tian thought of a question.

"Just one Immortal King - there's a chance!" Lo Tian muttered, "No matter what, we need to save the rest first!"

Lo Tian and Fu Xingyue set off together. They found a cave, beginning their plan. Both were shrewd; though anxious, they didn't lose control. They carefully planned, knowing one early-stage Immortal King wasn't easy to deal with.

Time passed slowly. The next morning, Fu Xingyue left the cave while Lo Tian stayed behind. He sat on his golden cart, taking out the Tianji Flame Vessel to start refining pills.

Chapter 2337: Ascending to Half-Step Immortal King

The valley echoed with thunderous sounds. Lo Tian's face was serious, constantly adding herbs to the Tianji Flame Vessel.

The Demon Soul Pill - a pill recorded in the Huanmo Stone, refined by three generations of demon cultivators. It could help a demon cultivator reach the half-step Immortal King.

Lo Tian was just one step away from becoming a half-step Immortal King. His biggest problem was his leg, still not recovered.

Time passed slowly. Two hours later, the Tianji Flame Vessel erupted with black qi. Nine black dragons coiled around it before rising into the sky, intertwining.

"Crack..." A thunderbolt struck the nine dragons, but they devoured it.

Nine thunderbolts collided with the nine black dragons. Finally, a single black pill hovered in the sky, radiating powerful energy.

Lo Tian opened his mouth and swallowed the pill. Not only that, he also devoured all the pills he had obtained from Master Chen Tianxin's cave in the Demon Forest.

"Boom..." A explosion echoed through Lo Tian's body. Thunderous sounds filled his entire being, and wild demonic qi rushed toward his dantian.

"Ahh..." Lo Tian screamed in pain. His body cracked again, growing three times larger, turning him into a fat man.

"Grow!" Lo Tian roared. The previously broken leg, whose wound had healed, suddenly split open. Blood gushed out, and powerful demonic qi erupted. Lo Tian's leg began to grow slowly.

One inch... ten inches... each inch of flesh grew, making Lo Tian scream in pain. This method was pure self-torture, using the explosive power of pills to force his body to regenerate. No one could endure this pain; failure would result in explosion.

Lo Tian had no choice but to try. He was desperate - each day delayed meant another death. Though few, he didn't want these people to die because of him.

Time passed slowly. A long process - Lo Tian felt each day like a year, watching his leg grow.

Three hours later, Lo Tian's right leg finally grew back. Black patterns flowed across it, and his meridians reconnected. Lo Tian's plump body returned to normal.

"Buzz..." At the same moment, a powerful aura rose from Lo Tian's right leg.

"Boom!" The black demon in Lo Tian's dantian shattered as he ascended to the half-step Immortal King.

Lo Tian sighed deeply, feeling the demon's destruction. He couldn't avoid building a Demon Altar anymore. The Mind Scripture activated, gathering the chaotic demonic qi in his dantian.

A wave of demonic qi coalesced into a palm-sized demon altar, hovering in his dantian with terrifying pressure.

"It's truly strong. Next is to refine the altar through thunderbolts, making it extremely solid," Lo Tian mused. He knew that after refining the altar to a certain level, he would ascend to the Immortal King realm. But this was a long process requiring ninety-nine thunderbolts.

"It's time to rescue them," Lo Tian muttered, sitting cross-legged on the ground, waiting for Fu Xingyue's return.

Time passed. Night fell. A figure appeared like a shadow outside the cave, bearded and wearing a leather coat, looking rugged.

"Buzz..." Lo Tian opened his eyes slowly as the man appeared.

"Success?" The man exclaimed, surprised. He looked at Lo Tian's overwhelming aura and waved his hand, revealing Fu Xingyue's face. The Thousand Faces Mask also appeared in Fu Xingyue's hands, restoring his normal appearance.

"How did it go?" Lo Tian asked Fu Xingyue. Fu Xingyue had spent the day wearing the Thousand Faces Mask, gathering information in Jiutian City.

"It's as Zhou Zhiwen said. The Eastern Palace only has one early-stage Immortal King and two half-step Immortal Kings guarding them. But if the Central Heaven Consortium's people see the Eastern Palace attacked, they might intervene - that's the biggest variable," Fu Xingyue said softly, recounting his findings to Lo Tian.

"So we'll have to lure them out," Lo Tian thought. He didn't plan to seek help from anyone; if he did, it would be helping them, not harming.

Moreover, Lo Tian was confident now. With his current strength and the ability to use the Demon Body's Splitting Technique, he could fight an early-stage Immortal King. Even if he couldn't win, he could escape safely.

"Once we rescue them, you'll take everyone to the Huan Tian Sea. We'll cross it - the teleportation array is definitely out of commission!" Lo Tian kept refining his plan.

They plotted all night, ensuring it was foolproof. The next morning, a scorching red light rose from the mountain where Lo Tian and Fu Xingyue were. Nine-colored flames coiled through the sky, their power reaching for the heavens.

This strange phenomenon immediately caught the attention of Jiutian City's people. After all, Lo Tian and Fu Xingyue were not far from the city.

"What is that? Nine-colored flames!"

"It must be a great opportunity!" Jiutian City's people were shocked. Such a commotion - they believed there must be a great treasure.

"Roar..." At the same time, a series of roars echoed through the sky. Strange phenomena made people even more terrified, rushing out of Jiutian City toward the red light's direction.

"What's going on?" As the head of Jiutian City, the Central Heaven Consortium naturally received news. Many strong people also rushed there.

"This must be a rare treasure!" On the other hand, the three remaining from the Eastern Palace had expressions of excitement. They clearly recognized the value of such a treasure, and they were also moved by it.

"You two stay here to guard the entrance. I'll get my share when I return," the early-stage Immortal King said, smiling as he flew off. He left two half-step Immortal Kings behind to guard the entrance.

As news spread, most people in Jiutian City rushed there. Lo Tian sat cross-legged at the cave's entrance, his eyes gleaming with intensity. He waved his hand, and dozens of pills appeared in his hands.

"The Mirage Pills refined by Feng Huanzi. Their effect is several times stronger than the illusions created by Feng Huanzi himself. They should be enough to trick an Immortal King!" Lo Tian smiled, holding his breath as he crushed the pills, letting the powder scatter into the air.

After crushing the powder, Lo Tian and Fu Xingyue hid on the Butian Stone, heading toward Butian City. No matter if it succeeded or not, they had to rescue the people from the Star Domain today.

As Lo Tian and Fu Xingyue left, a series of breaking sounds echoed. Several figures with powerful energy appeared at the spot where Lo Tian and Fu Xingyue had been.

"Hot energy. There must be some fire here!" One Immortal King's eyes flashed like lightning, expanding his domain to cover a thousand zhang. His brows furrowed slightly.

As the people arrived, the Mirage Pills' powder scattered with the wind, instantly enveloping them.

"This is a mirage..." One early-stage Immortal King shouted, but before he could finish, he inhaled a lot of powder. His eyes turned hazy, and he fell from the sky.

Boom... Boom...

As the early-stage Immortal King fell, others also plummeted like rain. Their eyes were vacant, clearly having fallen for Lo Tian's trick.

At this moment, Lo Tian had the Butian Stone fly toward Jiutian City. He sat on it, his hands moving constantly, sending out waves of demonic seals that formed two dragon patterns. These dragons landed on his body.

With a thunderous roar, Lo Tian's half-step Immortal King aura rose again. His physical strength and demonic qi intensity also increased. The palm-sized demon altar in his dantian grew larger.

"Just one step away from early-stage Immortal King!" Lo Tian mused, stepping off the Butian Stone and flying toward Butian City as a long rainbow.

Lo Tian's current speed was terrifying. A journey that should have taken an hour was done in half an hour, reaching Butian City. He took off the Thousand Faces Mask, put it on again, and let Fu Xingyue guide him to locate where the Star Domain's people were held.

Dark prison gates. Two half-step Immortal Kings sat there, smiling and chatting. This was where the Eastern Palace had taken over Jiutian City to hold the Star Domain's people.

"Do you think this time, Third Elder will get something good?" One half-step Immortal King asked, unaware of the death threat approaching.

"I don't know. Anyway, there should be some gains. Just not sure how much we'll get," the other replied, clearly doubting the early-stage Immortal King's promise of sharing.

"Kill..." As they spoke, Lo Tian and Fu Xingyue both flew out from the Butian Stone. They suddenly appeared behind them, striking together.

Not only was it a surprise attack, but even if they faced them directly, the two wouldn't have been able to match Lo Tian and Fu Xingyue.

"Boom... Boom..." Two clouds of blood rose, their faces still smiling as they were killed by Lo Tian and Fu Xingyue.

"Go..." Lo Tian waved his hand, sending nine-colored flames to destroy their blood and soul. He rushed into the prison gates.

Chapter 2338: Blocking

Time was what Lo Tian and Fu Xingyue needed most now. Every moment gained was another safeguard.

They rushed into the dark prison gates immediately, seeing the Star Domain's warriors held captive inside.

The prisoners had no hope in their eyes. They knew no one would come to save them. When Lo Tian and Fu Xingyue appeared, the prisoners gave a slight tremor.

"Your Majesty!" The prisoners shouted, seeing Fu Xingyue. Their eyes showed excitement - they hadn't expected Fu Xingyue to come rescue them.

"Master!" In a cell, the Eight Shadow Guards sat there, their faces showing shock as they looked at Lo Tian.

"Crack..." A sword cut through, shattering the chains of the Eight Shadow Guards' cell. Lo Tian stood there with his demonic qi.

"Let's go first!" Lo Tian didn't have time for words, rushing toward other cells with his sword slicing constantly.

Cracking sounds echoed. Cells shattered one by one as Lo Tian slashed without hesitation. After half an hour, the Star Domain's people all emerged from their cells.

"Go..." Lo Tian sighed deeply. This was just the first step; the next would be even more difficult.

Lo Tian and Fu Xingyue led nearly ten thousand people toward Jiutian City's southern gate, as it was closest to the Huan Tian Sea.

"Distance to Huan Tian Sea is half a day. Give it your all!" Fu Xingyue shouted, rushing toward the southern gate.

Ten thousand people moving together made Jiutian City lively. No one dared to confront their momentum, watching this black mass rush toward the southern gate.

The news of Lo Tian and Fu Xingyue's escape spread instantly to the governor's mansion, causing a stir.

"Rebellion!" The governor's mansion echoed with angry shouts. Its people gathered immediately. However, when the guards received a message, they stopped and ordered soldiers to stay put for an hour.

"Master Lo, I can only help you this far. This is my maximum authority," Zhou Zhiwen sighed softly. When he heard the news of an opportunity outside Jiutian City, he felt something was wrong - knowing it was Lo Tian's move. He had also prepared for various emergencies.

"Boom... Boom..." Nearly ten thousand people rushed through, smoothly exiting Jiutian City's southern gate. Lo Tian wore a grateful expression. He knew that as a subsidiary of the Nine Great Mountains, Jiutian City couldn't be unaware. And he only had a relationship with Zhou Zhiwen of the Central Heaven Consortium. Since Jiutian City hadn't moved, it was clearly Zhou Zhiwen's mediation.

"You go ahead. I'll hold the rear!" Lo Tian told Fu Xingyue and others, watching those who had followed them out of Jiutian City.

Some were Eastern Palace disciples; others were from different sects. They knew about Fu Bei's death and that these people were captured by Fu Tianhan, so they wanted to track Lo Tian's movements to report back to Fu Tianhan for rewards.

"Be careful," Fu Xingyue said, his eyes showing concern.

"Don't worry!" Lo Tian nodded, watching Fu Xingyue and others leave. He stood there, looking at those who had flown close.

"This path is blocked. Go back!" Lo Tian held Longyuan Sword, his aura overwhelming. His gaze carried killing intent.

"Who are you? This path isn't yours. Why won't you let us pass?" A youth shouted. At this moment, Lo Tian had already put on the Thousand Faces Mask; no one could recognize him.

"Pass this path? Die!" Lo Tian's demonic qi surged. His gaze locked onto them.

"Buzz..." Some figures ignored Lo Tian's words and rushed toward Fu Xingyue's direction.

"Did you just ignore me?" Lo Tian sneered, slicing with his sword. Black sword qi rose instantly, scattering five blood mists. Lo Tian appeared at the spot where they had just passed.

Five people were killed instantly, stunning those who watched. Many timid ones turned pale, staring at Lo Tian.

"We are disciples of the Nine Great Mountains. Do you dare kill us?" A middle-stage True Immortal youth shouted.

"I killed Fu Bei, so I can certainly kill you," Lo Tian replied coldly. He didn't want to waste time, slicing with his sword again. The youth who had spoken was instantly cut down by Lo Tian's sword.

These people had no grudge with Lo Tian. If it were usual, he might have let them go. But now it was about his life and the lives of nearly ten thousand Star Domain people. If they passed, it would be dangerous for them.

"Whoa..." Next moment, the pursuers' faces showed shock. A large number of people flew back into Jiutian City.

Lo Tian's words had a stronger震慑 than killing the previous people. After all, these people were disciples of the Nine Great Mountains who could walk freely in the Central Three Realms. But compared to Fu Bei's status, they were nothing. Lo Tian had killed Fu Bei; killing them would be no problem.

Still, some bold people stayed behind. Their eyes shone with intent - if they could kill or capture Lo Tian, it would be a great achievement.

"Give me your life!" A half-step Immortal King shouted, flying toward Lo Tian.

"If that's the case, I have no choice. It's your own death!" Lo Tian sneered, flying up with Longyuan Sword. Black sword qi split the sky, slicing toward the half-step Immortal King rushing at him.

At the moment Lo Tian's sword qi rose, the half-step Immortal King suddenly stopped. His face was pale, sensing an irresistible force above him. When he reacted, a black big sword had already fallen.

The half-step Immortal King instinctively raised his long sword to meet it, but it was useless.

"Crack..." The sound of breaking echoed. Golden swords were shattered into fragments by Longyuan Sword. The wide blade split the half-step Immortal King in two.

"Dead... dead! That was a half-step Immortal King. How could it be so easy, like cutting tofu? Is he an Immortal King?" Those remaining trembled. Two middle-stage True Immortals instantly flew back toward Jiutian City.

"Zhi zhi..." A black long bow appeared in Lo Tian's hand. Five demonic qi gathered into five arrows, placed on the Sun-Seeking Bow. The bowstring trembled.

"Boom... Boom..." Five streaks of light flew from Lo Tian's hand, instantly appearing behind the five fleeing people. Five blood mists rose, making people tremble again.

"Did you think to get rewards by tracking our movements? Did you prepare for the cost?" Lo Tian sneered, holding Longyuan Sword and plunging into the crowd.

Heavenly Dao techniques enveloped them, making people feel a heavy pressure. Two half-step Immortal Kings wanted to escape immediately but couldn't.

Lo Tian's combat power was terrifying. Killing them was like killing chickens, and within moments, three middle-stage True Immortals were cut down. The speed was terrifying.

"Try to run?" Lo Tian sneered, activating the Yellow Spring Step. He became a streak of black light, slicing down and beheading one half-step Immortal King.

Like a tiger in a sheep pen, the remaining fifty or so people were cut down half by Lo Tian's fierce attacks. Corpses and blood lay on the ground.

"Fight back!" The remaining people regained their senses, knowing Lo Tian wouldn't let them go. They joined forces to attack Lo Tian.

But it was useless. At this moment, Lo Tian's physical strength had become变态 to the extreme - truly comparable to an early-stage Immortal King. Half-step Immortal Kings were no match for him.

An hour passed. Fifty or so people were all killed by Lo Tian's sword. His gaze flickered, and he flew toward the route he had previously discussed with Fu Xingyue.

As Lo Tian's footsteps left, several figures appeared at Jiutian City's southern gate. Seeing the blood and corpses on the ground, their faces darkened instantly.

"Damn it, we were tricked. That mountain had nothing!" A middle-aged man growled, the early-stage Immortal King from the Eastern Palace.

"Who dares to cause trouble outside my Jiutian City!" At this moment, several figures also rushed out of Jiutian City - the guards who had been suppressed for an hour by Zhou Zhiwen.

"Damn it, I'll remember this - Central Heaven Consortium!" The early-stage Immortal King gritted his teeth. He ignored the people from the Central Heaven Consortium rushing out and flew away.

"Their goal was to capture those people, luring them away!" The remaining people's faces were filled with excitement. They had been excited to rush to the mountain, but upon arrival, they fell into the trap. After searching the entire mountain, they found nothing.

"Brilliant strategy!" The group felt anger - being tricked was frustrating. But they couldn't help but admire the rescuer's calculation.

"This time, the Eastern Palace has no face!" Someone laughed, from other sects.

Lo Tian moved like lightning toward Fu Xingyue's direction. He didn't dare to delay, his aura still formidable.
