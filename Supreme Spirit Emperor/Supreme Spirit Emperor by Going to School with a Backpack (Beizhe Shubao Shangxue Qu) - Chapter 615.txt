“Seems I’ll have to visit the Chaos Heaven Sect again this time,” Luo Tian mused internally. He surmised that Guan Hongseng must have obtained a Huanmo Stone back then.

“Mind Demon Elder Chen Tianxin!” Zhou Zhiwen’s gaze fell upon the characters etched into Chen Tianxin’s mountain cliff, his expression darkening.

“Was that great catastrophe of the Illusory Heaven Sect truly orchestrated by Butean Mountain?” Luo Tian furrowed his brow, doubt gnawing at him.

“What heavenly and earthly rare stones are there that hold no worth before my Butean Stone?” The voice of the Butean Stone, long silent, resonated within Luo Tian’s mind as it unshackled Fu Bei’s seal.

“Thank you,” Luo Tian communicated with the Butean Stone, sensing its frailty. This was the first time he had heard its voice so feeble.

“Don’t mention it—why did I end up with such a cursed master? Truly, my luck is dire,” the Butean Stone replied, its tone laced with resignation.

“Enough of this—where exactly is the Huanmo Stone?” Yin Xiu muttered, scanning the hall again.

“Look up,” Zhou Zhiwen said, directing his gaze to the ceiling. A black crystal hovered above, casting waves of dark light.

“Behold—the Huanmo Stone!” Hunxuan gasped, his voice trembling with exhilaration. Luo Tian’s eyes locked onto the black crystal, and instantly, his mind reeled as if staring into a vortex of darkness.

The others gazed at the Huanmo Stone with longing but held back.

“To be at odds with Butean Mountain forever…” Their hesitation stemmed from Chen Tianxin’s final testament. Luo Tian stood there, a disciplinary elder of Butean Mountain. Even if he were not one of them, they would never dare swear such a blood oath; otherwise, their fate would mirror that of the Mind Demon Elder.

“Venerable Master, this is a demon beast—allow me to use the perfected Dharma to purify the souls trapped within this stone,” Jie Du murmured, retrieving a wooden fish and sitting cross-legged. He chanted softly, striking the instrument rhythmically.

Luo Tian’s group ignored Jie Du, their focus returning to the floating Huanmo Stone. They pondered solutions—how could they leave without seizing it?

“Hum…” As the group prepared to attempt their approach, the Huanmo Stone emitted a tremor, releasing waves of black mist. Jie Du’s body radiated divine light, and an invisible force began purging the dark mist.

“Brilliant—this Buddhist Dharma is precisely what subdues this stone. When the monk falters, strike then—perhaps that’s when the Huanmo Stone is weakest,” the Butean Stone whispered in Luo Tian’s mind.

Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed with hope, his gaze fixed on the Huanmo Stone clashing against the Dharma. Meanwhile, Jie Du’s wooden fish struck faster and slower in turns, his face breaking into a sweat.

“No matter what, we must try,” Zhou Zhiwen declared, determination in his eyes. He leapt skyward, charging toward the Huanmo Stone.

“Qianxue, do you like it?” Luo Tian turned to Gu Qianxue, his expression soft.

“It’s beautiful and practical,” Gu Qianxue nodded, her eyes alight with hope. Among the five Huanmo Stones, she deemed this one most valuable—ancient masters’ insights.

“I’ll give it to you,” Luo Tian murmured, his voice quiet yet resolute.

As Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue spoke, Zhou Zhiwen had already braved the immense pressure to reach the Huanmo Stone. He lunged for it—

“Roar!” The next moment, Zhou Zhiwen’s vision shifted. His entire body seemed frozen in place as a black serpent lunged toward him.

To Luo Tian’s group, waves of dark mist engulfed Zhou Zhiwen, corroding him.

Luo Tian sprang into action, his Longyuan Sword humming violently. He slashed through the mist, grasping Zhou Zhiwen’s ankle and pulling him down with his cultivation.

“Too close…” Luo Tian frowned, his mind hazy from pulling Zhou Zhiwen free. Clearly, Zhou had fallen into the illusion.

“Huff…” Zhou Zhiwen panted, expelling the dark mist from his body. His eyes held relief.

“Terrifying—those illusions are impossible to resist!” Zhou Zhiwen glanced warily at the Huanmo Stone, now restored.

“Expected—I fell here before, and even then, I was ensnared. To seize it directly would be certain doom,” Luo Tian replied softly.

“There’s no alternative unless we swear blood oaths—perhaps the Huanmo Stone would yield to us,” Zhou Zhiwen shook his head. To him, it was an impossibility.

“Zhou Xiong, let’s discuss the division first,” Luo Tian interjected, his gaze on Zhou Zhiwen.

“Luo Xiong, do you have a plan?” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, Zhou Zhiwen’s eyes brightened. If Luo Tian spoke thusly, he must have some confidence.

“A plan, albeit uncertain,” Luo Tian replied, drawing everyone’s attention.

“Luo Xiong, how do you propose we divide it?” Zhou Zhiwen asked, his gaze on Luo Tian. They had no means to seize the Huanmo Stone and might return empty-handed.

“I claim this stone, but I’ll share its insights with all of you! I only need the stone itself,” Luo Tian declared to the group.

“This…” The others furrowed their brows, except Hunxuan, who remained calm. He had been ensnared by the Dao Heart Seed Demon technique; in essence, he was Luo Tian’s subordinate. Whatever they possessed relied on Luo Tian’s favor. Zhou Zhiwen and Yin Xiu frowned, recalling the Mind Demon Elder’s records stating that only insights of past demon embryos were within. Yet who knew what secrets lay hidden? After all, the Mind Demon Elder was but a demon embryo born from the Huanmo Stone.

Even if no other secrets existed, it could be stored in their sect or used as a heritage. Moreover, with the Central Heaven Consortium’s methods, it could fetch a high price.

But since they had no means to seize the Huanmo Stone, they could only comply.

“Luo Xiong, I’ll let you take this one, but the one in the Mind Demon Elder’s cave—please grant it to me!”

“Of course, I’ll offer you a reward that satisfies all,” Zhou Zhiwen said to Luo Tian’s group.

“Not so fast—this one, I’ll also vie for! I’ll share half the Dao Heart Seed Demon Ritual with all of you. And since you led us here, I’ll give you some benefits too—Dao Heart Seed Demon?” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed as he looked at Zhou Zhiwen.

“This…” Upon hearing Luo Tian’s words, everyone inhaled sharply—even Gu Qianxue. She hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so resolute in obtaining the Huanmo Stone.

“I don’t want my wife holding something like a couple’s item!” Luo Tian mused internally. If others knew his thoughts, they’d find it absurd.

“Fine!” Zhou Zhiwen didn’t hesitate to agree. The Mind Demon Elder’s specialty was Dao Heart Seed Demon and Mind Demon Illusions—every immortal in the celestial realm coveted it.

“But Zhou Xiong must promise not to pass it on to others!” Luo Tian said solemnly. He hesitated, but upon recalling Zhou Zhiwen’s affiliation with the Central Heaven Consortium and his subordination to the Nine Immortal Mountains, he felt reassured.

“Luo Xiong, rest assured. If it happens, I’ll swear a blood oath to ensure no one else receives it. For the next Huanmo Stone, I’ll definitely not contest with you! And I’ll cover all others’ rewards,” Zhou Zhiwen replied. This move effectively secured three of the Huanmo Stones for him.

“Then that’s settled!” Luo Tian nodded, his gaze on the Huanmo Stone above. Meanwhile, Jie Du’s sutras continued reciting, albeit at a slower pace.

“Pf!” Time passed; an hour had elapsed. Jie Du could no longer endure, spitting blood as his recitations and wooden fish strikes ceased abruptly.

“Now!” Luo Tian saw Jie Du’s blood, leapt into the air, and became a streak of light. He reached the Huanmo Stone instantly, grasping its dark radiance.

Cold energy immediately invaded Luo Tian’s hand. Simultaneously, his surroundings shifted—his body felt frozen, and he stood shivering as five women in revealing attire approached him.

“Qianxue, Sisi, Qiuchan, Xingxuan, Sudan!” Luo Tian instantly recognized them. His lower abdomen burned with heat but he remained paralyzed.

“Truly, the Huanmo Stone knows my weakness!” Luo Tian gazed at the five women, his heart stirred. It had been a long time since he’d seen Jiang Sisi and Leng Qiuchan.

“But Jie Du’s sutras have weakened it significantly—this illusion is crude!” Luo Tian coldly spoke, biting his tongue to stay alert. He desperately struggled against the restraint.

“What’s happening? Again, engulfed by demon mist?” Gu Qianxue and the others saw Luo Tian as they had seen Zhou Zhiwen, wrapped in dark mist. The only difference was that the mist surrounding Luo Tian was thinner.

“Failed?” Gu Qianxue’s eyes brimmed with worry, her gaze on Luo Tian. Her black sword glowed ominously, ready to rush and save him.

Chapter 2323: The Demonic Body Liberation ()

In the dim hall, a black crystal hovered above. A figure seemed glued to it, wrapped in dark mist.

“It’s been half an hour—should this continue, danger may arise!” Yin Xiu spoke, concern rippling through the group.

“Enough waiting!” Gu Qianxue coldly said, leaping into action with her black sword. She rushed toward Luo Tian.

At this moment, the dark mist had thickened to a point where it formed a barrier. Her sword clashed against the barrier with a resounding crack.

“Crack…” The dark mist barrier cracked, but Gu Qianxue was repelled and crashed onto the ground.

Her black silk robe stained with blood, her sword returned to her hand, leaving people in awe.

“Such density!” Zhou Zhiwen gasped. Earlier, even a single strike had left him in agony; now, with so much mist, not even Gu Qianxue could break through. The barrier’s strength was evident.

“Damn it!” Gu Qianxue seethed internally, leaping again with a wild look. She didn’t know what she felt toward Luo Tian. Initially, he had annoyed her, but after learning the truth, her feelings for him shifted significantly. Yet she couldn’t let him die.

“I don’t want it anymore—come out!” Gu Qianxue shouted, rushing toward the dark barrier. Her sword danced and slashed at it again. The clash echoed, and the barrier trembled slightly. But this time, Gu Qianxue was even more battered. The explosive force shattered her hat, and her sword flew out of her hand.

Her beautiful face appeared in Zhou Zhiwen’s group, blood trickling from her lips. Gu Qianxue fell to the ground in a heap.

“Let’s all strike together—see if we can break this barrier!” Zhou Zhiwen couldn’t watch anymore, shouting at Yin Xiu and the others. Their hands emitted thunderous sounds as they unleashed martial arts, striking the barrier.

Boom after boom echoed across the hall. The barriers trembled but remained intact, repairing their cracks with relentless dark mist.

“I don’t want it anymore—come out!” Gu Qianxue roared, rushing forward again with madness.

Her black sword, stained with her blood, glowed with crimson runes. It surged and slashed at the barrier. Time paused momentarily; the black sword shattered, falling to the ground. Gu Qianxue’s body also plummeted.

“It still won’t work!” Gu Qianxue gazed at the barrier, now mending itself. Her eyes held despair.

Boom… Just as Gu Qianxue fell, a thunderous sound erupted from the barrier. The cracks spread rapidly, and an immense power surged outward.

“Boom…” Under Zhou Zhiwen’s group’s shock, the dark barrier exploded into swirling mist, engulfing the entire hall.

“Stupid wife, I’m fine!” A soft voice echoed. Next moment, a figure appeared beside Gu Qianxue, embracing her.

Two eyes glowed with tenderness and depth, descending from the sky to land before Zhou Zhiwen’s group.

“Luo Tian!” Zhou Zhiwen and the others gasped, watching Luo Tian descend with Gu Qianxue. They seemed like a divine couple on earth.

“Apologies for worrying you!” Luo Tian smiled, not releasing Gu Qianxue. A fool would miss an opportunity—especially with his wife and child already. As a married couple, what was there to fear?

Gu Qianxue was extremely weak. The three strikes had drained her significantly, especially the last one—even a half-step immortal king would be wary. She wanted to break free but found herself tightly held by Luo Tian, her face flushed yet she said nothing.

“Idiot!” Luo Tian cooed before inhaling the dark mist filling the hall.

“Indeed, Luo Xiong is a demon cultivator—he doesn’t fear these dark mists. In fact, they’re nourishing for him, enhancing his cultivation!” Zhou Zhiwen’s face lit up with joy.

“Huanmo Stone is gone!” Yin Xiu exclaimed, gazing at the hall’s ceiling. His breath quickened with excitement.

The hall’s ceiling was now open. Everyone gazed at Luo Tian, though they knew the outcome, they still waited for his confirmation.

“Not disappointing!” Luo Tian smiled slightly, opening his hand to reveal the black crystal radiating divine light.

“Success!” Zhou Zhiwen’s group eyes gleamed with excitement, staring at the black crystal.

“Alright, everyone—now I’ll activate this Huanmo Stone to let you all experience it,” Luo Tian said, approaching Jie Du.

At this moment, Jie Du’s face was pale, his body weak. His gaze met Luo Tian with a gentle smile and an unyielding resolve.

“Luo Xianzhu, this is a demonic object. Please entrust it to me so I may purify the souls trapped within,” Jie Du said, causing Luo Tian some exasperation.

“Giving it to you is impossible. However, I can let you seal it—your current strength isn’t enough to purify the Huanmo Stone’s demonic nature,” Luo Tian replied softly. Without Jie Du, he wouldn’t have seized the Huanmo Stone during its weakness.

The illusion earlier was crude compared to what Luo Tian had faced before, but he still struggled to break free.

“Luo Xianzhu truly seeks goodness! It seems my sutras have had an effect!” Jie Du’s eyes gleamed with light. Though wounded, his expression was filled with relief.

“You keep acting like this—I won’t let you seal it!” Luo Tian felt exasperated. He was also worried about Gu Qianxue carrying the Huanmo Stone.

“Indeed, it’s time for Luo Xianzhu to grasp the sutras I recited earlier. If you have any questions, I can discuss them with Luo Xianzhu—don’t be shy to ask…” Jie Du droned on. Zhou Zhiwen and Yin Xiu’s eyes showed annoyance.

“Alright, can you start now?” Zhou Zhiwen interrupted Jie Du, addressing Luo Tian.

“Can you let me down first?” Gu Qianxue’s face turned red. Their position was awkward—though nothing had happened, her presence under Luo Tian’s gaze made her uncomfortable.

Luo Tian didn’t continue holding her; earlier in the illusion, he had been tormented. Now embracing Gu Qianxue made him even more uncomfortable. He resisted the urge to kiss her, placing her on the ground instead.

“This is what it is—I’m his wife and mother of his child!” Luo Tian inwardly cursed, handing Gu Qianxue a pill before waving his hand to activate the Huanmo Stone.

The Huanmo Stone activated, casting waves of black light that enveloped the hall’s group. However, this darkness was weaker than before.

“Hum…” Suddenly, Luo Tian’s surroundings changed again—visions of past demon embryos’ cultivation insights and combat experiences flooded his mind.

Everyone’s faces lit up with joy, sitting cross-legged to absorb the insights. Luo Tian did likewise, and the hall fell into silence.

Luo Tian skipped over combat experiences since he had fought extensively across the Nine Regions, matching or surpassing past demon embryos.

“Demon Dragon Mind-Hand… Turning Heaven and Demon Seal…” Luo Tian observed the past masters’ martial arts, his eyes thoughtful.

These techniques were formidable and suited for Luo Tian’s cultivation. Yet he didn’t lack martial arts—too many made it hard to master. Still, he couldn’t ignore good techniques and examined them one by one.

“Demonic Body Liberation!” Finally, Luo Tian’s eyes brightened, spotting an intriguing technique.

“Seventh-generation demon embryo—created by the Mind Demon Elder Chen Tianxin!” Luo Tian saw a weathered figure standing beside a mountain wall.

The silhouette was forlorn, and Luo Tian instantly recognized it—Chen Tianxin, in his old age.

Chen Tianxin meticulously carved complex hand seals onto the mountain wall, fully focused. Each inscription caused the mountain to tremble with a powerful aura.

The mountain surged upward, radiating an overwhelming presence.

“Boom…” As if reaching a threshold, the black mountain exploded violently, unleashing an apocalyptic force that turned everything into ruins within miles.

“Terrifying!” Luo Tian’s eyes widened in fear, feeling himself reduced to ashes under that explosion.

“Butean Immortal King—this is my gift for you!” Chen Tianxin murmured, his figure gradually fading.

“Regrettable,” Luo Tian mused internally. He knew Chen Tianxin must have been a genius, resisting the Huanmo Stone’s control and splitting it into five. His strength and audacity were evident, yet he perished at Butean Immortal King’s hands.

Moreover, Chen Tianxin couldn’t have been so old—evidently, he had suffered greatly. This “Demonic Body Liberation” was as unconventional as the Dao Heart Seed Demon, its power too immense.

Chapter 2324: Exit the Demon Hall ()

Regrettable, this Huanmo Stone holds no record of that battle—such a clash must have been spectacular!” Luo Tian mused, envisioning two formidable figures clashing.

He continued observing but found no martial arts that intrigued him further. Yet one elder’s cultivation method caught his interest.

This was an insight left by a generation of demon embryos, detailing how to break through the Immortal King realm.

Demon cultivators defied fate, while ordinary cultivators claimed to defy fate but actually followed it. Even now, every Immortal King’s domain was forged from heavenly forces—still following fate. Even demon cultivators eventually had to compromise.

This elder, however, devised a method to defy fate entirely—though it was extremely perilous. A single mistake would reduce one to a wisp of dust beneath the heavens. If successful, they’d become an unparalleled powerhouse.

“Summoning thunderstorms to forge a demonic altar, creating an ultimate demonic domain!” Luo Tian carefully observed the method left by one generation.

“Cultivate the Dao Heart Seed Demon Ritual, forge a demonic body—every ninety-nine days, thunderstorms descend. Through the storm’s trial, forge an indestructible demonic altar…” Luo Tian’s lips twitched. The first step was to cultivate the Dao Heart Seed Demon Ritual.

“Every ninety-nine days, endure a thunderstorm and swallow it into your body—this is seeking death!” Luo Tian mused internally, yet he still recorded the method.

Luo Tian continued observing until he finished the Huanmo Stone’s contents, then vanished into a space.

“Next, I’ll cultivate the Demonic Body Liberation!” Luo Tian gazed at the mountain wall, his hands moving rapidly to form seals.

His hands danced, etching runes onto the mountain wall while its aura gradually rose.

“Boom…” However, as Luo Tian had just completed half the seals, the massive mountain wall exploded violently, scattering divine laws around him.

“Too slow to form seals—this time, I could have been attacked thrice!” Luo Tian muttered. Though the Demonic Body Liberation seals were complex, his initial clumsiness meant it took time.

“Though my strength isn’t as great as Chen Tianxin, the power I unleashed shouldn’t be this weak. This strength is barely comparable to the Hellish Ghost Claws!”

“Something’s wrong—my seal techniques and demonic energy flow are correct. Why is my power weaker than Chen Tianxin’s? And why haven’t I completed the seals?” Luo Tian’s eyes narrowed, pondering his differences with Chen Tianxin.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian mused, another mountain wall appeared before him—identical to the previous one.

Luo Tian furrowed his brows, staring at the wall without rushing to form seals. After a while, he tried again.

Seals flew rapidly—his second attempt was much swifter. Yet when he had completed two-thirds of the seals, the golden mountain wall exploded violently again.

“Not right?” Luo Tian gazed at the destroyed mountain, its power stronger than before. Yet he knew this was merely due to his slight improvement and not the fundamental solution.

“I won’t give up!” Luo Tian resolved, eyes fierce.

“Think… experiment… think…” Luo Tian repeated this process without boredom, as he had grown accustomed to it.

Boom… Boom…

The thunderous sounds echoed around Luo Tian, and his seal-forming speed increased. The power of the golden mountain wall’s destruction grew stronger. Yet Luo Tian never fully mastered the Demonic Body Liberation.

Time passed slowly, and Luo Tian immersed himself completely, forgetting time and place.

Two days had passed when the hall’s group awoke one by one, their faces glowing with joy—evidently, they had gained much.

“This Huanmo Stone is truly a treasure!” Zhou Zhiwen sighed. This stone could rapidly forge a powerful cultivator—its insights, martial arts, and cultivation methods were top-tier in the celestial realm.

“Regrettable, some things we can’t cultivate—only demon cultivators can!”

“Luo Tian hasn’t awakened yet. Clearly, he’s the biggest beneficiary!” Yin Xiu murmured, gazing at Luo Tian still seated. He was a demon cultivator.

“Alas, he’s already too变态 (abnormal), this will make him even more so. Who among our generation can match him? Perhaps only the elder generations could suppress him!” Zhou Zhiwen’s face bore admiration.

“Luo Xianzhu, don’t delve too deep into demon arts!” Jie Du sighed softly. He had only absorbed a little and emerged, his insights not aligning with his path.

“Wait—when did Luo Xianzhu catch up to us? We didn’t sense it at all!” Zhou Zhiwen spoke again, causing the group’s eyes to widen with confusion.

“Luo Xianzhu’s methods are too many—just summoning a reincarnation channel alone is astonishing!” Yin Xiu said, his voice laced with admiration. To have a Dan Shi (herbalist) so awed is rare.

“Earlier, whenever we faced danger, it was Luo Tian who secretly helped us!” Gu Qianxue softly said, causing the group’s faces to shift again. She recounted their past events.

“I yield!” Yin Xiu said, and Hunxuan’s face also bore admiration.

Meanwhile, Luo Tian sat cross-legged before the mountain wall, gazing at another appearing one. After two days of destructions, the mountain wall had exploded multiple times. His seal-forming was now proficient, yet he still hadn’t fully mastered the Demonic Body Liberation.

“Liberate—liberate whose body!” Luo Tian’s eyes gleamed, gazing at the familiar mountain wall.

“His own!” Luo Tian suddenly shouted, his hands moving rapidly to release demonic runes onto the mountain wall.

“I understand!” Luo Tian’s heart thrilled. He finally grasped it—Demonic Body Liberation didn’t liberate the enemy’s body but the practitioner’s own. To liberate, one must understand—obviously, their own body.

Chen Tianxin’s ability to destroy the mountain and create such a powerful explosion clearly stemmed from his deep understanding of it.

“Here… here…” Luo Tian muttered, having observed the mountain’s structure for two days. He knew even its smallest cracks.

This time, he finally completed the entire set of Demonic Body Liberation seals.

“Boom…” A thunderous explosion echoed, and a violent wave surged outward, filling Luo Tian’s body with apocalyptic power.

“Hum…” Simultaneously, Luo Tian opened his eyes, two beams of divine light swirling within them. He saw Gu Qianxue and the others waiting for him.

“If I apply this technique on myself, with my strength, it could annihilate an Immortal King at the early stage!”

“Hence why Chen Tianxin said it was a gift for Butean Immortal King. But this is a self-destructive method—once completed, the practitioner would be annihilated. If incomplete, it might enhance their strength—but I need to test it myself!” Luo Tian mused internally, finally understanding much.

“Congratulations, Luo Xianzhu—your strength has improved again!” Zhou Zhiwen and the others said, their eyes filled with envy.

“Everyone, shall we continue to cultivate?” Luo Tian smiled, addressing Zhou Zhiwen and the others. He inwardly sighed—this Huanmo Stone journey had yielded much.

“No, we’ve already recorded everything beneficial to us,” Zhou Zhiwen and the others shook their heads.

“Then let Jie Du Master seal this Huanmo Stone,” Luo Tian smiled, addressing Jie Du.

“An obligation!” Jie Du was more than willing to do this. His hands formed seals, and golden runes flowed onto the Huanmo Stone.

Luo Tian still felt uneasy, so he applied a hundred ghost seals to it again before taking out a black chain, binding the Huanmo Stone and handing it to Gu Qianxue: “As a necklace, it’s quite good.”

“This…” Gu Qianxue’s face was hesitant. She knew the Huanmo Stone’s value and hadn’t expected Luo Tian to go to such lengths just for her liking.

“Take it—don’t waste Luo Xianzhu’s goodwill. Gu Qianxue, you’re truly fortunate!” Zhou Zhiwen noticed Luo Tian and Gu Qianxue’s relationship, quickly offering her a way out.

“Thank you,” Gu Qianxue softly said, taking the Huanmo Stone necklace. It hung around her neck, falling onto her chest beneath her clothes. Thinking of Luo Tian’s hands having touched it, Gu Qianxue blushed slightly.

“Alright, can we depart now?” Zhou Zhiwen asked Luo Tian. With Luo Tian being the strongest among them, they hadn’t even entered the Mind Demon Elder’s cave yet and had faced so many trials. If they entered the true cave, who knew what dangers awaited?

“Proceed,” Luo Tian nodded, gazing at the hall’s ceiling. If they exited the hall, they could leave.

Luo Tian led the way, flying upward toward the ceiling. The others followed closely. Though it seemed only a few hundred zhang away, they felt as if they had flown thousands of zhang. They reached the exit that only allowed two people to pass at a time.

“Go…” Luo Tian didn’t hesitate, rushing through the dark hole and landing on the ground. The others also stood beside him.

As they exited, they saw a series of courtyards filled with figures cloaked in black mist. Luo Tian and the others immediately gasped.

Chapter 2325: Huanmo Soldiers ()

Black bodies, swirling mist, and eyes filled with madness—standing in the courtyards. They had lost their minds.

Their power was astonishing, with nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine figures. The weakest were at the True Immortal Initial Stage, while three of them were at the Half-Immortal King level.

“These are the Mind Demon Elder’s Huanmo Soldiers! Controlled by the Mind Demon Elder to fight for him. They once annihilated countless sects!” Zhou Zhiwen gasped, retreating.

As he spoke, figures rushed toward Luo Tian’s group. With over three thousand people, they seemed to block the sky. Three thousand more held hand seals, forming terrifying martial arts that ascended into the heavens, filling the air with apocalyptic energy.

In an instant, the black Huanmo Soldiers surged toward Luo Tian’s group. With no escape route, they were forced to confront them.

“Hum…” A black fist slammed toward Luo Tian, who countered with a punch.

“Boom…” A True Immortal Initial Stage Huanmo Soldier was instantly crushed by Luo Tian’s punch. Yet it was futile—more attacks surged toward him.

“Everyone, stay together! Don’t scatter!” Luo Tian pointed, wrapping himself and Gu Qianxue with a black demonic rune.

Boom… Boom…

The collision sounds erupted instantly, and Luo Tian’s group was surrounded by over three thousand Huanmo Soldiers. They dared not scatter, for if they did, the result would be certain death.

“Is this guarding a cave?” Luo Tian mused, his Longyuan Sword striking relentlessly at the Huanmo Soldiers.

“These are Huanmo Soldiers skilled in body combat!” After a brief battle, the group realized their difficulty. Their bodies were pitch-black, and despite being True Immortal Peak-level experts, they needed two strikes to kill a True Immortal Mid-Stage Huanmo Soldier.

“Boom…” As the group fought, the three thousand Huanmo Soldiers who had formed martial arts finally launched their attack. Waves of apocalyptic techniques filled the sky, rushing toward Luo Tian’s group.

“Everyone—!” Luo Tian saw the apocalyptic waves and felt a strong crisis. He immediately launched, creating a black barrier with the Heaven-Devil Dao Method to enclose everyone. Others also unleashed their techniques, and six layers of barriers instantly rose.

“Boom…” As the group’s barriers barely formed, waves of terrifying martial arts slammed onto the outermost barrier.

The collisions continued, each one making Luo Tian’s face pale. After a hundred breaths, the martial arts still had half to fall, and Luo Tian’s barrier shattered, causing him to spit blood.

“Damn it!” The second barrier was formed by Zhou Zhiwen. As the martial arts descended, he felt their strength and his face turned pale immediately, starting to support the barrier.

Yet within thirty breaths, Zhou Zhiwen also spat blood, and his barrier shattered.

“What do we do?” Yin Xiu shouted, starting to block the martial arts. Worse still, the Huanmo Soldiers skilled in body combat began slamming into their barriers.

Within a few breaths, Yin Xiu’s barrier shattered, following Luo Tian and Zhou Zhiwen’s fate.

“Think of a way!” Luo Tian gazed at the approaching Huanmo Soldiers, recalling their earlier clash. Though they had killed many, it was still insufficient.

If it were just himself, he wouldn’t fear them—his body strength and speed could withstand these Huanmo Soldiers. But the three Half-Immortal King-level Huanmo Soldiers were problematic.

Yet Gu Qianxue was here, and Luo Tian couldn’t let her face danger. Thus, he chose to fight head-on.
