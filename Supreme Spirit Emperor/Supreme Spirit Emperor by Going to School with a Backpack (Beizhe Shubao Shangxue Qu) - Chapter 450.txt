In a moment, the golden blood coalesced, and Luo Tian's figure materialized before everyone's eyes. At that moment, Luo Tian exuded an aura of reverence and completeness.

"Awakened the Path!" Everyone's hearts pounded with excitement, their breaths echoing beneath the starry sky.

"Ten Thousand Ancient Crumbles Under My Fierce God's Seven Steps!" Luo Tian gazed at the demon spirit and the bloodstain on Zhang Daotian's chest, his eyes burning with intense killing intent. With a single step forward, he surged toward the demon spirit to obliterate it.

"Boom..." As Luo Tian took his first step, everyone snapped back into awareness, resuming their previous state. Their gazes held awe, and the sword light on Zhang Daotian's chest ceased.

"Boom... Boom..." The thunderous sound shook the heavens, a golden foot spanning across time's river, instantly appearing above the demon spirit.

"Crack..." The golden foot shattered space, directly crushing the demon spirit with a resounding sound.

"Crack..." A brittle sound echoed from the demon spirit's withered body, blood gushing from its pale mouth as it stared in disbelief.

"Injured!" People's eyes lit with joy, watching the demon spirit fall. This was the first time a demon spirit had suffered such damage.

Cracks spread across the demon spirit's body, and waves of blood qi erupted from the fissures.

"Damned! You've fully absorbed that Heaven's Seal!" The demon spirit roared, its gaze filled with shock and fear.

"Still, it's useless!" The demon spirit spat blood but steadied itself. A black small sword reappeared in its hand, radiating an overwhelming aura.

"Buzz..." A hum resonated from the demon spirit's body again, and its already withered form grew even more gaunt, like a desiccated husk.

"Perfect!" Luo Tian stood beneath the starry sky, his gaze filled with a faint admiration. He felt an unprecedented strength within himself; no being in the Nine Realms could now intimidate him.

Though the collision had wounded Luo Tian, he had fully refined the Heaven's Seal within his body by harnessing the demon spirit's attack.

"One Sword Against Immortals?" Luo Tian observed the oppressive aura from the demon spirit's black small sword, his expression darkening. The Heaven's Seal Thunder Sword returned to Luo Tian's grasp.

"Let us settle this!" Luo Tian murmured, his dantian roaring with power. The轮回通道 (Reincarnation Channel) surged with immortal qi, pouring into the Heaven's Seal Thunder Sword.

"The battle between a perfected reincarnation body and an immortal-grade flesh-formed demon spirit—whose strength will prevail?" Everyone's hearts leapt into their throats, fixated on Luo Tian and the demon spirit as they prepared a formidable attack.

"Kill!" Both men spoke in unison, their swords igniting with world-shattering brilliance as they clashed.

"Crack..." Time halted again, leaving everyone breathless, as if a hammer had struck their chests. Their ears rang with a continuous hum, and the already gray starry sky shattered like glass.

Power surged, rekindling chaos in the Star-Scattering and Revenant Realms. The sky darkened with swirling gray mist, becoming a forbidden zone.

"How is it going?" Everyone's faces bore hope, including the Ancient Clans. They hoped Luo Tian would slay the demon spirit; if it won, they wouldn't fare well either. Luo Tian had previously vowed for coexistence among the clans.

Time passed slowly, an hour vanishing in a blink, yet the swirling gray mist showed no sign of calming.

"What's happening?" Everyone anxiously awaited, desperate to know the outcome.

"Spit..." As they waited, Zhang Daotian's face paled, coughing up black blood. Though he spat blood, his eyes gleamed with joy.

"The demon spirit is dead!" Zhang Daotian shouted to the crowd, his voice trembling with excitement as he gazed at the gradually calming mist.

"Buzz..." Golden light rose, and the gray mist slowly settled. A golden figure stood there, its aura immeasurable as it panted heavily.

"Damned, I might be the most pitiful epoch master ever! Others become epoch masters and are invincible, but I look like this!" Luo Tian muttered, his body appearing before the crowd. Yet he bore no resemblance to an epoch master or ruler; instead, he looked like a beggar.

"Rumors spread," the crowd murmured, their gazes on Luo Tian. Though he was disheveled, admiration shone in their eyes.

"This kid must be the youngest epoch master in Nine Realms history!" Gu Tianshu and others mused, their eyes filled with relief as they watched Luo Tian.

Cheers erupted; everyone cheered loudly, including the Ancient Clans, before bowing deeply.

"Kid, as an epoch master, you should have a title. Choose one yourself!" Zhang Daotian's face was pale. Though the demon spirit was slain, Zhang Daotian had also suffered injuries but within his tolerance. A short rest would heal him.

"I say, 'Invincible Lord!'" Biao Dedu shouted, radiating an aura of invincibility.

"Shut up! I think 'Lord Luo Tian' sounds better!" Zheng Xin and others shouted, the scene erupting into chaos. Though Luo Tian had become an omnipotent being, in their hearts, he remained the same Luo Tian.

"Alright, let's call him 'Reincarnation Lord!' After all, this kid is a reincarnated body!" Yin Tianxiong spoke softly, recalling Luo Tian's nine past lives.

"Good!" Hearing Yin Tianxiong's words, everyone nodded, finding the name elegant.

"Everyone go back. When this period stabilizes, I'll wait for you all on Tianyuan Continent!" Luo Tian smiled, raising his hand. Waves of energy radiated from it, and the crowd vanished from Luo Tian's sight.

"Let's go too; a peaceful era is coming!" Luo Tian chuckled, swiftly returning with the group to Tianyuan Continent.

In the grand hall of Tianyuan Continent, everyone instantly appeared, their faces alight with joy.

"How does it feel to become an omnipotent being?" They laughed and chatted, their affairs now resolved.

"Not much—just stronger," Luo Tian nodded, his gaze deep. He had become a Heaven-Ordained powerhouse, making entry into the Immortal Realm possible. Yet he hadn't forgotten Gu Qianxue was still in the Immortal Realm.

"Hmm, you must feel a summons now. You might ascend anytime!" Zhang Daotian addressed Luo Tian.

"What summon?" Luo Tian's confusion deepened, unaware of what Zhang Daotian meant.

"You don't feel it? All who reach Heaven-Ordained must sense an invisible pull. Ascending to the Immortal Realm is inevitable, though the timing varies—perhaps immediately after attaining Heaven-Ordained or in ten years, a century, or even longer!" Zhang Daotian was puzzled.

"Nothing at all!" Luo Tian shook his head, feeling only immense strength, capable of shattering a domain.

"It's normal; I didn't feel it when I became an epoch master!" The Demon King shook his head, then gazed at Luo Tian.

"Father, you once said you found an opponent to battle—so who was it?" Yao Chen's eyes glowed with gold, asking the Demon King, drawing everyone's attention to him.

Chapter 1751: The Immortal Road ()

"Who? Even the epoch master Yao Huang Tian nearly perished!" Everyone's faces bore confusion, gazing at the Demon King.

"The Heaven's Seal," the Demon King spoke softly, his gaze deep. He glanced at everyone, and their hearts sank slightly.

"If one wishes to become an immortal, they must defy the heavens!" Gu Tianshu spoke softly, echoing what he had told Luo Tian.

"I once discovered an immortal trace in the Bone Forest and found these words there!"

"This Heaven's Seal must refer to the Heaven's Seal!" Gu Tianshu explained.

"What is the Heaven's Seal? It nearly killed Luo Tian and Gu Tianshu!" Everyone looked puzzled, recalling the Heaven's Seal Eye during Luo Tian's tribulation.

"Open the Immortal Road!" The Demon King spoke again, scanning Luo Tian's body with a solemn tone.

"Once I obtained the Epoch Book and opened a great path. If my guess is right, it must be the Immortal Road! Reaching its end leads to the Immortal Realm!" The Demon King's words sent shockwaves through Luo Tian and others.

"So the Epoch Book is the key to the Immortal Realm!"

"And on the Immortal Road, there are barriers—namely, the Heaven's Seal!" The Demon King added, his gaze grave.

"The Epoch Book is no ordinary artifact," Zhang Daotian interjected, his eyes dark with sorrow before a long sigh.

"Master, what exactly is the Epoch Book?" Luo Tian asked hurriedly, as the Epoch Book was now on his person.

"Once I obtained it too; 'a flower, a world; a page, three thousand realms.' The Epoch Book holds infinite mysteries!" Zhang Daotian spoke, leaving everyone puzzled.

"Moreover, if my guess is right, the Heaven's Sect was destroyed because of the Epoch Book!" Zhang Daotian's eyes darkened with pain, speaking softly.

"What?" Upon hearing Zhang Daotian's words, the crowd's faces changed. Those transported to the hall by Luo Tian were all trusted allies, so no secrets were kept.

"Everyone thought the Heaven's Sect was destroyed because of Xueyin and the sect's treasure, the Heaven's Seal Thunder Sword. But in my mind, it was because of the Epoch Book!"

"Once I obtained the Epoch Book by chance and became a prodigy of the Heaven's Sect. My name spread across the Immortal Realm, naturally drawing attention from other sects." Zhang Daotian recounted his past.

"Before my master's passing, no one dared to provoke the Heaven's Sect. But after his demise, it was targeted. Though the Heaven's Sect had enough strength to withstand a Life-Immortal King, that was only an open-faced immortal. I felt there were other immortal kings behind the scenes—perhaps one had already acted!" Zhang Daotian's face was cold; he was no longer the naive youth of before. After three lives, including one on the Ancient Immortal Continent, he had matured.

"A single Heaven's Seal Thunder Sword wouldn't have made two immortal kings fight!" Zhang Daotian continued, revealing his suspicions.

"At first, I thought the Epoch Book was just an ordinary treasure. But later, it saved me from danger multiple times. I believe my entry into the Nine Realms was due to the Epoch Book!" Zhang Daotian's voice carried admiration.

Upon hearing Zhang Daotian's words, people turned their gazes to Luo Tian, surprised by the Epoch Book's mystery. Now, this artifact that even immortal kings coveted resided on Luo Tian.

"It's not urgent; first, stabilize the Nine Realms. As for the Immortal Realm, I'm not ready to enter yet!" Luo Tian spoke, scanning everyone's faces. His roots were in the Nine Realms; though he longed to enter the Immortal Realm, he hesitated to leave his loved ones. Yet Gu Qianxue might be there, and he would eventually need to find all the Epoch Books to ascend.

"Revenant Realm has a page of the Epoch Book, and Star-Scattering also does. They should grant you that favor!" Jiang Nanxuan spoke softly.

"Hmm," Luo Tian nodded, then added: "Everyone rest for now. With the coexistence of clans, I'll enter the Immortal Realm only after the Nine Realms are fully stabilized!"

"Hah, finally can relax! Who dares mess with me now!" Biao Dedu and others laughed, heading to their quarters. Others also left the hall.

"Go on, my three wives; I'll accompany you for a long time!" Luo Tian smiled at Jiang Sxi, three women.

Jiang Sxi and the others smiled faintly but bore a hint of sorrow. They knew Luo Tian's nature; he would definitely go to the Immortal Realm.

Time flowed slowly, and the Nine Realms began to recover peace. The name "Reincarnation Lord Luo Tian" spread across the Nine Realms, and his deeds were celebrated. A new epoch master had emerged—what a monumental event!

"A month from now, Reincarnation Lord Luo Tian's wedding will be held. All are welcome to attend the ceremony! We of Tianyuan Continent welcome you and the Ancient Clans!" Half a month later, a voice echoed across Tianyuan Continent, causing the Nine Realms to erupt.

"Reincarnation Lord's wedding! I must see Reincarnation Lord!" The Nine Realms erupted, everyone's faces alight with excitement.

"Did you hear? Reincarnation Lord's bride is the former Emperor of the Star-Moon Clan, a beauty of the Ancient Clans!"

"Even Reincarnation Lord married an Ancient Clan member!" People erupted in surprise. Those who had previously resisted the Ancient Clans gradually accepted their integration.

"This wedding of Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan is our opportunity—a chance for peaceful coexistence with the human race. We must attend!" In the blood clan's territory, Tu Feiyang sighed, addressing his kin.

"Haha, little bastard, remember our Star-Xing?" In the Star-Moon Clan's domain, joyous laughter echoed as Star-Moon clan members cheered.

"Emperor Lord, attend the commander's wedding and bring us along!" Star-Moon guards shouted.

Other clans also stirred, preparing for Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan's wedding. With the Ancient Clans weakened, Luo Tian's ascension as an omnipotent being had already pleased them. Their attitudes were gradually shifting, reducing hostility toward humans.

Human race's side needed no explanation; Tianyuan Continent and the entire Four Sacred Star Realms bustled with activity.

People flocked to the Four Sacred Star Realms, human and Ancient Clan members alike. When humans met Ancient Clans, they didn't fight but nodded to each other.

Who was the most relaxed in the Nine Realms? It was Luo Tian and his juniors. Even Jiang Sxi's three women were busy, so Luo Tian wouldn't neglect them. He wanted to host another wedding for them across the Nine Realms.

These days, Luo Tian guided his juniors in cultivation constantly, and their progress was astonishing. With an epoch master's guidance, they received the treatment of a royal heir.

The dazzling and glorious era seemed to fade, with ancient clan heirs and epoch master disciples quietly fading under Luo Tian's brilliance.

Time passed swiftly, a month later—Luo Tian and his group's wedding day arrived. The Four Sacred Star Realms were packed with people.

On the Five Elements Mountain of Tianyuan Continent, six human elders sat at the front, their faces smiling as they watched the orderly humans and clans below.

"This scene must have surprised our ancestors!" Gu Tianshu sighed, his eyes smiling.

"Human race's success today is due to the efforts of past epoch masters!" Dong Boxin spoke softly, surprised they had witnessed a coexistence of clans. Though there were still barriers, they believed time would improve the situation. War would still exist but could be controlled.

"Buzz..." As they mused, waves of energy echoed in the sky. Luo Tian, clad in red, smiled as he appeared above the sky.

"Thank you all for attending my wedding with my wife!" Luo Tian stood in the sky, suppressing his aura but still imposing pressure.

"This is our human race's epoch master!" People smiled, respectfully gazing at Luo Tian in the sky.

"I have too many people to thank; those who helped me over the years. My deepest thanks go to my four wives!" Luo Tian spoke, gazing at four figures in red approaching from the distance.

"Congratulations to Reincarnation Lord and his four wives!" A thunderous cheer erupted, and under the people's blessings, Jiang Sxi, Leng Qiuchan, Sun Mengru, and Fu Xingxuan approached Luo Tian.

"Hard work!" Luo Tian's eyes softened, gazing at the four with deep affection.

"Don't make me attend another wedding!" Leng Qiuchan teased, looking at Luo Tian. This was her third wedding with him.

"Alright, the newlyweds should perform their rites!" Luo Xiong's face beamed as he laughed, seeing his grandson awkwardly.

"Okay, be careful next time!" Sun Mengru and the others smiled at Luo Tian's expression.

"Who would have thought the epoch master was such a timid person!" People smiled, watching Luo Tian carefully before Sun Mengru.

The wedding was smooth; at the banquet, Luo Tian felt like he had shed his skin, toasting with one table after another. The crowd was immense.

"Haha, who else could get an epoch master to toast? I'm the first!" People smiled.

"Luo Tian, this is Star-Scattering's gift!" Zhou Wei laughed, waving his hand. Five starlight necklaces appeared in the crowd.

"You know I don't care for other treasures, but this is a common one. However, it's rare—crafted from starstone. Star-Scattering Realm's starstone is now extinct!" Zhou Wei spoke, handing four necklaces to Luo Tian.

"Thoughtful!" Luo Tian smiled, accepting the gift. He secretly marveled at Zhou Wei's tact, giving five and even a starstone for Gu Qianxue.

"Don't say that; without you, Star-Scattering wouldn't have recovered!" Zhou Wei shook his head. The Star-Scattering Realm was now weak, most of its subordinates destroyed by the Zhu Tian Alliance. Rebuilding was difficult. Luo Tian had recently restored Star-Scattering and Revenant Realms after his battle with the demon spirit.

"Hey, just four starstones—how dare you show it?" Yan Hongtao sneered, waving his hand. A storage ring appeared in Luo Tian's hands.

"What is this..." Luo Tian accepted the ring, his mind sensing its contents instantly.

A golden page floated within the storage ring—part of the Epoch Book.

"We don't need this now; I guess you must need it, right?" Yan Hongtao smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

"Thank you!" Luo Tian nodded but didn't reveal the page. He feared that if he fused it into the Epoch Book, the Immortal Road would open before he was ready.

"This is my蛮族 (Fierce Clan)'s gift... This is the Blood Clan's..." One by one, Ancient Clans offered their carefully prepared gifts to Luo Tian. Though not precious, they were rare; they knew Luo Tian's current strength made him indifferent to epoch treasures.

"Thank you all!" Luo Tian didn't refuse, accepting everything from the clans, signaling his complete acceptance of them.

Time flowed slowly; the wedding lasted seven days before people gradually left. Luo Tian finally felt drained, returning to his marital chamber.

The room was tidy; Jiang Sxi and the others默契 (in harmony) didn't intrude, leaving space for Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan.

"Xingxuan!" Luo Tian smiled, approaching the bed where Fu Xingxuan stood in red. She was exceptionally beautiful.

"You're back!" Fu Xingxuan gazed at Luo Tian, her eyes full of tenderness. Their journey had cost much, but for this grand wedding shaking the Nine Realms and Luo Tian's love, her sacrifices were worth it.

"Finally, I can help you openly!" Luo Tian smiled, his hands moving. The long night passed effortlessly.

"Get up! Get up!" The next morning, Jiang Sxi, Sun Mengru, and Leng Qiuchan blocked the door.

"Alright!" Luo Tian kissed Fu Xingxuan, who lay like a cat in his arms. He smiled.

"This is what I wanted!" Luo Tian stretched, his aura now indistinguishable from an ordinary person.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian and Fu Xingxuan quickly dressed, exiting the room to meet Jiang Sxi.

"Where to today?" Luo Tian smiled, planning to spend time with his four wives, making up for past and future.

"Visit Star-Scattering to watch stars... Visit the Fire Realm to see fire oceans... Visit the Demon Realm..." Jiang Sxi smiled, listing destinations with Sun Mengru and others. They vanished from the spot.

Days passed leisurely; Luo Tian and Jiang Sxi's group disappeared from Tianyuan Continent, no one knowing where they went. They wandered the Nine Realms' scenic spots like ordinary people.

The Nine Realms stabilized completely; the Mortal Realm, Thunder Realm, and Origin Realm were fully controlled by Ancient Clans. Relations with humans gradually improved. The dazzling era of young talents ended with Luo Tian's awakening, ushering in a new epoch of coexistence among clans.

Time flowed slowly; ten years... a century... a millennium. The Nine Realms remained peaceful, with sects and clans recovering through rest.

As Luo Tian's generation of strong warriors faded, new generations of talents emerged—Luo Li, Luo Xiting, Chu Chen, and others grew into independent forces. Luo Tian became a legend, an epoch master who vanished but was known to still reside in the Nine Realms. Yet no one knew his whereabouts, only glimpsing his and his four wives' shadows occasionally.

...

"Thousand years!" On a red mountain in the Fire Realm, Luo Tian stood in white robes, his hands behind his back. His four wives, radiant and elegant, bore contented smiles.

A thousand years of companionship was the longest time they'd spent together since their marriage. Though a millennium had passed, time left no mark on their faces.

"Let's go!" Luo Tian smiled, leading the four down the red mountain. A millennium of wandering had passed without urgency; they'd explored every corner of the Nine Realms, witnessing countless wonders.

In an ordinary town, a simple tavern, a middle-aged couple worked busily. Luo Tian smiled as he entered the tavern.

"Master Zhao, we're back for a meal!" Luo Tian laughed at the smiling middle-aged man.

"You're back! My wife has already prepared for you!" The man laughed, drawing puzzled glances from customers. This tavern had existed for centuries; everyone knew the couple was no ordinary people. The tavern had stood for hundreds of years, with the same couple always running it.

Some had come to cause trouble before but were effortlessly thrown out by the man, regardless of who they were.

Zhao Fengshan and his wife had been saved by Luo Tian on the Reincarnation Bridge. Luo Tian had promised to restore their flesh bodies, and during his wanderings, he'd done so. They chose to live quietly in this town, and Luo Tian often visited when passing through the Fire Realm.

"Master, I finally found you!" As Luo Tian and his four wives sat down, a thunderous voice echoed outside. A tall young man strode into the tavern.

"Zhan Biao, you've awakened! This sleep spanned an epoch!" Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the towering figure before him—Chen Zhanbiao, who had remained asleep since Luo Tian's awakening.

"Awakened!" Chen Zhanbiao grinned, eyeing the table of food and drooling. He grabbed a chicken leg and stuffed it into his mouth without restraint.

"How are they?" Luo Tian asked softly; he hadn't returned to the Four Sacred Star Realms in a millennium.

"Good, but I miss you. Master Zhang told me to tell you: if you're done playing, return for a visit; he has something to say!" Chen Zhanbiao devoured his food.

"Hmm, it's time to return," Luo Tian sighed, the Nine Realms now fully stabilized.

Hearing this, Jiang Sxi, Leng Qiuchan, Sun Mengru, and Fu Xingxuan's expressions paused slightly, a hint of sorrow in their eyes.

"Leaving?" Zhao Fengshan and his wife smiled, raising a cup to toast with Luo Tian. They drank the wine in one go.

"Hmm, I suppose so. But for a while yet!" Luo Tian nodded slightly, clinking cups with Zhao Fengshan.

"Next time we meet, I might be a pile of dust. Don't forget to bring wine and toast me at my grave!" Zhao Fengshan sighed, knowing this parting might be eternal.

"Maybe I'll fail! Then I'll still keep coming for meals!" Luo Tian chuckled; the Immortal Road had even stymied Yao Huang Tian. What chance did he have?

"You'll succeed, for sure!" Zhao Fengshan shook his head. As one who had watched Luo Tian grow, he knew Luo Tian would succeed.

"Take care!" Luo Tian sighed deeply before leaving the tavern with Jiang Sxi and others.

"Farewell..." Zhao Fengshan and his wife sighed, standing up slowly. They gazed at the void before resuming their work. Yet this meal would never be touched again by Zhao Fengshan.

Walking under the starry sky, Jiang Sxi and others smiled, but Luo Tian sensed their attachment. A bold idea stirred in his heart, growing stronger each moment.

Chapter 1753: The World Ascends to Immortality ()

Under the starry sky of the Four Sacred Star Realms, Luo Tian and his group walked. A bittersweet feeling stirred in Luo Tian's heart as he gazed at the familiar realm. If he truly reached the Immortal Realm, he might never return.

"Can I part with my family and friends?" Luo Tian pondered, a bold idea forming in his heart.

"Let's all ascend together!" Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with resolve, deciding to take everyone from Tianyuan Continent into the Immortal Realm.

"But it's difficult!" He soon recalled the harshness of the Immortal Road. Even Yao Huang Tian hadn't succeeded in his prime. What chance did he have?

"Still, I must try!" As Luo Tian mused, they arrived at Tianyuan Continent, standing on the grand Five Elements Mountain.

"Luo Tian..." As soon as he appeared, Gu Tianshu and others sensed it. The elders were idle but resided on Tianyuan Continent.

"Master!" Luo Tian smiled, his body flickering into the grand hall where they stood.

"Back from your wanderings?" Zhang Daotian smiled, standing behind him with Zhang Ziping, Ji Chenlei, and Yong.

Gu Tianshu and others sat there; younger generations stood behind the elders, their faces lighting up at seeing Luo Tian.

A millennium had passed; the Nine Realms transformed dramatically. Luo Tian's generation, like a flood, surged into the realm of near-epoch masters, echoing the glorious era of antiquity.

Many juniors had already married and had children. Luo Tian was now a grandfather, but this was due to the late marriages of these juniors. The Luo family had become a sacred sect in the Nine Realms, yet they remained within the Five Elements Sect, claiming one lineage.

Luo Tian didn't interfere with their affairs; after all, each had their own path to walk.

"Back means we must discuss important matters!" The Demon King spoke softly, his eyes glowing with a fierce light.

"Indeed, you must prepare. The Immortal Realm differs from the Nine Realms; time flows differently. A day in the Immortal Realm equals ten thousand years in a small world. Thus, if you ascend to the Immortal Realm, your lifespan won't exceed a millennium. To live longer, you must elevate your cultivation!" Zhang Daotian sighed softly.

"Who knows why people ascend to the Immortal Realm? They live so long, but staying in their small world is better!" Zheng Xin and others scoffed.

"Goals differ; some seek the pinnacle of cultivation, while others desire immortality. You've lived long enough now, becoming the peak of the Nine Realms. Eventually, you'll die. Do you wish to pass away quietly?" Dong Boxin shook his head, a hint of sorrow in his gaze.

Hearing Dong Boxin's words, everyone fell silent. Indeed, they lived freely now but would eventually die. People might forget their existence then.

"Enough; we're still young, with plenty of time to waste!" Luo Tian shook his head. He had decided; he would live longer than those present. He didn't want to watch his beloveds die or see relatives leave him one by one, leaving only himself in the world.

"I have an idea—let's all try to break through the Immortal Road! Perhaps we can all enter the Immortal Realm!" He then shared his idea with the hall, leaving it in silence.

"Impossible..." Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, the Demon King's face slightly changed, immediately objecting.

"Though I've regained my memories, I still don't recall what happened on the Immortal Road. But it felt extremely dangerous; otherwise, I wouldn't have left Yao Chen in the Nine Realms!" The Demon King shook his head.

"I always feel the Immortal Road has some special rules—only specific people can enter, like those you brought from Star-府 (Star Palace). They were originally from the Immortal Realm, so they should be able to enter!"

"Also, Master Zhang was once from the Immortal Realm. I should be able to too. You all should be able to, and those with Star-Scattering Sect identities as well!" The Demon King gazed at Gu Tianshu and others who had lived two lives.

"Then I can't?" Dong Boxin looked puzzled; everyone else except him had lived two lives.

"Probably not," Zhang Daotian shook his head. As a former prodigy of the three top Immortal Sects, he knew many secrets.

"What if we force our way through?" Luo Tian frowned, suddenly realizing his idea was flawed.

He hadn't considered safety; he himself wasn't worried, but if these loved ones perished on the Immortal Road, could he bear it? After all, much of his strength came from the drive to protect them.

"Dead..." Upon hearing Luo Tian's words, both the Demon King and Zhang Daotian spoke simultaneously, their gazes on Luo Tian. This completely shattered his idea.
