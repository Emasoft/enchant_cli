“Nascent Soul Vein! Damned!” Several disciples from first-rate sects let out low growls, ignoring the surrounding primordial energy stones as they stared at the inky cave entrance before plunging in without hesitation.

Chapter 146: Explosion()

Chapter 146: Explosion!

“Five thousand zhang…” Luo Tian and his companions finally halted their excavation upon reaching the fifthousandth zhang.

“It’s empty!” Upon finishing their digging, they finally located the Nascent Soul Vein through its primordial energy.

As soon as they entered, they were stunned by the sight before them. Though situated five thousand zhang underground, this place’s primordial energy concentration was dozens of times stronger than the surface.

Before them lay a crystalline dragon, radiating dazzling light that illuminated this subterranean world with no trace of darkness.

Luo Tian had never seen a Nascent Soul Vein before, his eyes alight with ecstatic joy. His gaze then sharpened toward the dark hole they had dug.

“Unexpectedly, their movements were so swift!” Luo Tian’s spiritual awareness extended outward, sensing figures moving rapidly through the cave. His brows furrowed.

“At their current speed, they’ll reach here within a quarter of an hour. We don’t know how long it will take us to seize this Nascent Soul Vein. We must find a way to delay them,” Luo Tian muttered低声.

“You all dig it out first. I’ll find a way to block them!” Luo Tian urgently instructed Dong Sansi and the others.

Dong Sansi and his companions naturally felt the gusts of wind emanating from the cave entrance, realizing many had arrived. Without hesitation, they retrieved their weapons and resumed digging—but at an unusually slow pace.

Luo Tian ignored their progress, his face grave as he stepped into the cave. With a flick of his sleeve, countless elixirs materialized, forming a river of pills across the cave floor.

Each elixir bore a fragment of Luo Tian’s spiritual awareness—this was his first tactic to block the intruders.

After arranging elixirs for nearly a hundred zhang, Luo Tian sat cross-legged at the cave entrance. He activated his storage ring, summoning a massive bronze cauldron that sealed the passage, leaving only a narrow slit too small for anyone to pass.

Soul-Subduing Cauldron—even Luo Tian and his companions could not budge it. With this artifact in place, he hoped Dong Sansi’s team would hurry.

While Luo Tian muttered to himself, five disciples from first-rate sects suddenly appeared before the elixir-laden path.

Some confident disciples from second-rate sects followed closely behind, their confusion evident as the five halted.

“Is that Wang Siyuan from the Xuan Yin Sect? How did he end up here? Did first-rate sects arrive?” A disciple from Feiyun Sect murmured, staring at Wang Siyuan standing proudly.

“Ying Lei Sect’s Ying Hongtu—though he’s at Body-Refining Ninth Stage, even a Bone-Shattering Initial stage master couldn’t match his speed!” People gazed at the figure cloaked in blue primordial energy, marveling.

“Tianzhu Sect’s prodigy Bai Zhantian—rumored to be ready to enter Bone-Shattering Stage. He remained at Body-Refining Stage to become the strongest among those entering Bone-Shattering!”

“His duel against Pei Letian of the Five Elements Sect ended in victory!”

“Is that Rong Da from Bai Lian Sect? He’s mastered the sect’s unique technique, Tianji Refining, up to the thirtieth refinement. His body is stronger than a high-grade Yellow-ranked weapon!”

“Water Cloud Sect—why are they emerging? Is that Chen Changsheng from Water Cloud Sect? I heard he’s been nominated as a contender for the next sect leader!”

The murmurs of admiration echoed among the second-rate disciples, their gazes fixed on the five standing proudly. They knew this Nascent Soul Vein might belong to one of these five.

Though Luo Tian had impressed them, he was a newcomer. The five before them were seasoned masters with illustrious records.

“You! Enter!” Wang Siyuan pointed at a second-rate disciple, issuing the command.

“What?” The disciple was stunned—how could Wang Siyuan send them to be the vanguard into a place he himself dared not enter?

“Enter yourself, or I’ll toss you in!” Wang Siyuan didn’t wait for the disciple’s reply. His voice was cold, condescending, as if viewing them as mere insects.

The other four disciples ignored the exchange, merely crossing their arms and waiting for the disciple to enter.

“I….” The second-rate disciple hesitated, but before he could speak, a flash of lightning revealed Ying Hongtu’s figure before him.

“Why waste words on this scum? Take what you can!” Ying Hongtu’s face bore impatience. He grabbed the disciple and hurled him forward as if discarding trash.

The disciple barely had time to react before his body lightened, floating into the air. His face bore a look of frustration.

“Too much!” Other second-rate disciples, witnessing this treatment, glared with indignation. The five’s actions had utterly disregarded them.

Luo Tian, who had extended his spiritual awareness, noticed their behavior and frowned slightly in disapproval.

“Pound…” The sound of impact echoed as the disciple landed. He trembled with fear, unsure of his fate. He activated his primordial energy to protect himself.

Yet nothing happened. The disciple’s body crashed onto the ground with no sound.

Seeing he was unharmed, the disciple scrambled back, his face flushed with anger as he glared at Ying Hongtu.

The five young men, eyes filled with curiosity, gazed at the dark cave entrance.

“Hmph. See what tricks you have!” Wang Siyuan sneered, stepping forward with a footfall.

“Explosion!” Luo Tian’s cold voice rang out.

“Boom…” As soon as Luo Tian spoke, he triggered the three elixirs under Wang Siyuan’s feet to explode.

Though Wang Siyuan despised the tactic, his eyes narrowed in vigilance. At the elixirs’ explosion, he immediately retreated.

But Wang Siyuan had already advanced nearly five zhang. As he dodged the explosions, more elixirs detonated under Luo Tian’s control.

Though he evaded all explosive force, Wang Siyuan still appeared disheveled, his face darkening with a hint of killing intent.

“This place has a restriction! No, it’s not a restriction—it must have been planted by someone who entered before!” Wang Siyuan spoke with a gloomy face.

Chapter 147: Push the Cauldron()

Chapter 147: Push the Cauldron

“This isn’t a restriction!”

Bai Zhantian held an ink-black elixir, channeling primordial energy to suppress its explosion. He spoke solemnly.

“This person is too cunning. How many did he lay?” Ying Hongtu muttered低声.

“Must be Luo Tian. He wants to block our path and delay us!” Rong Da of Bai Lian Sect spoke with a grave tone, unable to think of anyone else capable of such tactics.

“Correct. It must be him. Those second-rate sect scum couldn’t afford so many elixirs!” Their resentment toward Luo Tian grew gradually.

“Regardless of who it is, once we pass, we’ll make him regret it!” Chen Changsheng said calmly.

“Everyone, how many elixirs are hidden along this path? Let’s join forces and push through together. What do you say?” Chen Changsheng proposed again.

The five exchanged glances. Though they harbored mutual disdain, they knew now was not the time for conflict. The Nascent Soul Vein was too precious; hesitation could cost them everything. They nodded in agreement.

After exchanging glances, they each retrieved their weapons, emitting powerful primordial energy waves. Under the energy’s influence, a massive force surged forward, as if scraping three feet of earth, directly colliding with the front. The cave seemed to widen, forming a clear path.

Five figures rushed forward instantly, followed by second-rate disciples who sprinted at full speed.

“Boom…” A heavy sound echoed.

The combined strength of the five struck the Soul-Subduing Cauldron, producing a dull thud.

Luo Tian sat cross-legged beside the cauldron. At the moment of impact, he knew all his elixirs were destroyed.

The cauldron withstood the force but sent tremors through Luo Tian’s body.

Turning around, he saw Dong Sansi and the others still hadn’t finished excavating. His face darkened: “Unexpectedly, they arrived so quickly!”

Wang Siyuan and the others advanced swiftly. Within a dozen breaths, they reached the cauldron’s front, staring at the bronze cauldron blocking the passage. Their faces bore intense shock and awe, realizing this cauldron was an extraordinary treasure. Their eyes gleamed with desire.

“This cauldron is mine!” Ying Hongtu’s voice hadn’t finished when he dashed to the cauldron, wrapping his arms around it.

“Raise it!” Ying Hongtu barked, veins bulging on his arms. Cracks formed under his feet.

“Want to hoard this cauldron alone? Dream on!”

The other four saw Ying Hongtu’s advantage in speed and immediately attacked him with their weapons.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound returned as Ying Hongtu vanished, and the combined force struck the cauldron again.

A wave of backlash emanated from the cauldron, causing second-rate disciples to feel their blood churn and collapse in droves.

Seeing the cauldron’s power, Ying Hongtu’s eyes glowed even more fiercely. The others also displayed wild excitement.

“Everyone, this cauldron is beyond our reach!”

Ying Hongtu noticed their wild gazes and sneered, clearly annoyed by their earlier actions.

“Hmph. It’s your lack of ability!” Wang Siyuan scoffed, speaking lowly.

“Prove it. If you can lift it, I won’t stop you,” Ying Hongtu said dismissively, crossing his arms to watch the spectacle.

Wang Siyuan sneered and approached the cauldron, his arms wrapped in brown and green primordial energy. He steadied himself and embraced the cauldron.

“Raise it!” Feeling its weight, Wang Siyuan gritted his teeth and poured all his strength into lifting it.

A wild surge of primordial energy erupted from Wang Siyuan. The cracks under Ying Hongtu’s feet reappeared, even more pronounced. His soles sank into the ground.

Wang Siyuan’s face was contorted with strain, sweat pouring down his forehead and soaking into the ground.

Ying Hongtu’s face bore mockery. He believed that if even he couldn’t lift it, Wang Siyuan certainly couldn’t.

The other three watched the unyielding cauldron with growing concern. They doubted their own abilities compared to Wang Siyuan’s.

“Huff…” Wang Siyuan panted, returning to his spot with a heavy expression. The cauldron’s weight had exceeded his expectations.

“Everyone, think of a solution. If this cauldron blocks our path, the Nascent Soul Vein might already be taken by Luo Tian!” Ying Hongtu spoke after the others remained silent.

“Let’s cooperate again,” Chen Changsheng said impatiently.

They were all proud individuals, naturally resistant to repeated cooperation—especially with someone of their own age. The fact that Luo Tian had set these traps made them feel inferior.

Luo Tian sat cross-legged on the other side of the cauldron, hearing their conversation. A sneer crossed his face: “Hmph. Five of you?”

As Luo Tian muttered, the five had already lifted the cauldron’s side and exerted their strength.

“Woo…” A powerful surge of primordial energy resonated from each of them.

Yet, despite their utmost effort, the cauldron remained unmoved.

“What is this cauldron? Even five of us should be able to lift a mountain!” Second-rate disciples marveled, their eyes filled with greed. They knew this cauldron was beyond their grasp.

Even if it were placed before them, they couldn’t lift it.

Ying Hongtu and the others also looked at the cauldron helplessly, as if a mountain had blocked their path.

“Can’t lift it? Then try pushing!” Chen Changsheng spoke again.

“Good!”

The five nodded, unable to think of another way. Their hands touched the cauldron’s surface again.

Luo Tian sat on the opposite side, only a few zhang away. Their words were clearly heard.

Chapter 148: Killing Intent()

Chapter 148: Killing Intent

“Move!” Ying Hongtu and the others hadn’t expected the cauldron to move at all, but with their combined strength, it actually shifted slightly.

This made them overjoyed.

“Move?” Luo Tian’s brows furrowed. He hadn’t expected their strength to be so formidable, yet they had managed to move the heavy cauldron.

“Why don’t they try using their storage rings?” A second-rate disciple asked, puzzled.

“Idiot. You think they haven’t tried? Ying Hongtu must have already used his storage ring upon arriving. Something prevented the bronze cauldron from entering it!” Another disciple sneered.

“Luo Tian! I know you’re inside. Be sensible and take this cauldron away, or we’ll make you pay dearly for blocking our path!” Wang Siyuan’s face darkened as he spoke.

They had felt the time was too long. If they continued delaying, the Nascent Soul Vein might be lost. Thus, he issued a threat.

Luo Tian heard their words and smiled faintly, placing his hand on the cauldron without a word. He intended to block their path with his own strength.

Dong Sansi and the others also heard the outside conversation. Their hearts were anxious, but they couldn’t help—this Nascent Soul Vein was fused with the stone wall. Even a high-grade Yellow-ranked weapon took great effort to excavate.

Wang Tianxiang glanced at Luo Tian, who had placed his hand on the cauldron. He understood Luo Tian’s plan and was stunned, his heart anxious. He quickly resumed digging.

“Almost there! Everyone, speed up!” Dong Sansi shouted.

Hearing Dong Sansi’s shout, Wang Siyuan and the others realized they were nearly done excavating the Nascent Soul Vein. They exerted more strength to push the cauldron.

Luo Tian felt the immense force passing through the cauldron. His eyes narrowed, and he planted his feet firmly, gripping the cauldron to prevent it from moving.

“Someone is blocking us!” Ying Hongtu’s face twisted with ferocity, staring at the cauldron that hadn’t budged.

“Again, it’s Luo Tian!” Chen Changsheng’s usually calm face finally showed anger. His face even bore waves of killing intent.

“Though this bronze cauldron has absorbed some force, I don’t believe he can withstand all five of us!” They roared again, exerting their full strength.

Luo Tian was in agony. His veins bulged as he felt the explosive power of the five. Sweat poured from his forehead.

“Why didn’t they dig another hole?” The second-rate disciple who had previously suggested using storage rings asked again, filled with curiosity. He looked at the one who had mocked him.

“Sss…” A gasp echoed as people heard his words, their expressions suddenly enlightened.

“Yes! There’s not just this entrance. Could they dig another?” They all looked around the walls, though it was thousands of zhang underground. For them, digging a hole was effortless.

Ying Hongtu and the others heard the disciple’s words. It was like a wake-up call. They roared, unwilling to waste any more time. They began striking the walls.

While resisting their combined strength, Luo Tian also heard their shouts. He sighed inwardly and returned to Dong Sansi’s group.

The Nascent Soul Vein, excavated by Dong Sansi and the others, had already revealed half its body. Luo Tian’s face darkened with resolve. He shouted: “Hurry and take this half Nascent Soul Vein. They’re coming!”

Upon hearing Luo Tian’s shout, they realized an unexpected event had occurred at the entrance. They summoned their weapons and smashed the half-dragon-like body.

Luo Tian also retrieved his Splitting Heaven Spear, striking the half-body fiercely.

“Crack!” After their combined attack, the dragon body emitted a crisp sound and broke off. Luo Tian quickly waved his hand, retrieving this half Nascent Soul Vein into his storage ring. None of the others showed resentment—they knew only Luo Tian could protect it.

“Boom…” As soon as Luo Tian stored the Nascent Soul Vein, a series of booming sounds echoed around. Several entrances appeared before Luo Tian and his companions.

Dust fell, and Ying Hongtu, Wang Siyuan, and others appeared in their sight.

When they saw the Nascent Soul Vein embedded in the wall, radiating intense primordial energy, their faces lit with joy. But upon noticing the clear break marks, their expressions darkened.

“Who is Luo Tian?” Rong Da’s voice was gloomy as he asked, wanting to know who had been blocking their path and taking half the Nascent Soul Vein.

The other four also looked at Luo Tian with dark expressions, their faces filled with killing intent. The temptation of the Nascent Soul Vein was too great.

Luo Tian led Dong Sansi and his companions to the side of the Soul-Subduing Cauldron. He waved his hand, and the cauldron was instantly stored in his ring.

“This!” Ying Hongtu stared at Luo Tian’s ability to store this incredibly heavy bronze cauldron. His gaze was drawn to the seemingly ordinary ring on Luo Tian’s hand.

“Storage ring!” Bai Zhantian’s face lit with joy. He hadn’t expected this kid to have so many treasures—first a strange cauldron, then a storage ring.

Storage bags were common, but storage rings were rare. The two were incomparable. A typical storage bag had only a few zhang of space, while even low-grade storage rings could have nearly a thousand zhang.

He had also heard that some masters’ storage rings were almost as large as the entire Tianyuan Continent.

Others also noticed Luo Tian’s storage ring. Their faces showed greed, then a flash of killing intent.

They had already decided to kill Luo Tian. If handled properly, even if he died in the Great An Forest, it could be blamed on its dangers.

“Leave or die!” Wang Siyuan’s cold voice echoed, addressing the second-rate disciples who had just entered.

Chapter 149: Battle with Celestial Prodigies()

Chapter 149: Battle with Celestial Prodigies

Wang Siyuan’s cold voice, accompanied by a rolling wave of killing intent, reached the second-rate disciples’ ears. The other four also looked at them with mockery, clearly not wanting anyone to know they were attacking Luo Tian.

Luo Tian felt the five’s killing intent toward him and knew they had decided to plunder his treasures. Second-rate disciples dared not attack him, but these young men were clearly not products of second-rate sects.

“Uncle, we should leave. I think their strength is not weak…” Wang Tianxiang’s face showed fear, standing before the five.

“Leave? I don’t think I can even leave! You all go first. This battle isn’t something you can get involved in!”

Luo Tian sighed, then his battle spirit surged.

The second-rate disciples, hearing their words, were momentarily stunned. A wave of resentment flashed in their eyes.

But due to the five’s strength, some weaker ones had already turned around silently. They knew this Nascent Soul Vein was beyond their reach. It was better to go up and collect some primordial energy stones.

Of course, some who thought themselves strong enough at Body-Refining Ninth Stage stayed behind, hoping to take advantage of the chaos.

Seeing most had left, Dong Sansi’s face showed a hint of regret. How many times had he failed to help Luo Tian due to his weakness? He glared at the five with a cold gaze, vowing to retaliate if Luo Tian met any misfortune.

“You all leave too!” Luo Tian turned, signaling Dong Sansi and the others to depart.

With reluctance, Dong Sansi and Wang Tianxiang led everyone along the passage upward.

“You are Luo Tian? You didn’t run. That’s impressive, your courage is indeed remarkable!” Rong Da said with admiration.

The remaining five also showed some admiration. They appreciated Luo Tian’s decision to stay instead of fleeing, which was the confidence they expected from their kind.

“Are you all not leaving?” Ying Hongtu and the others turned, asking the remaining dozens of Body-Refining Ninth Stage second-rate disciples.

“Not leaving. This place isn’t your private domain. We can leave if we want, but we won’t!” A muscular man shouted boldly, not believing these prodigies could be their opponents.

“Exactly!” The man’s words were met with agreement from those behind him.

“Then die!” Ying Hongtu’s thunderous voice echoed. Before he finished speaking, he dashed toward the man like lightning and punched him.

“Crack!” The man hadn’t reacted in time, being struck by Ying Hongtu’s lightning-infused fist. He spat blood and was thrown backward.

As the man landed, Ying Hongtu’s figure appeared above him. His foot descended directly onto the man’s head.

Blood and violence—people felt these two words, their eyes trembling as they watched the five. Some regretted staying.

“Ah… we won’t stay anymore!” Several disciples were terrified, Ying Hongtu’s speed was too fast. The man had died under his feet in just two breaths.

“Run!” Someone shouted, and the second-rate disciples all roared, fleeing into surrounding caves.

“you had your chance. Now it’s too late!” The four sneered, killing the terrified second-rate disciples.

These disciples were far weaker than their opponents. In such panic, they couldn’t match these five tigers. Soon, the spacious cave echoed with cries of agony.

Luo Tian watched the five slaughter over a dozen second-rate disciples, his eyes flashing with pity. But it was only a fleeting moment. Without these five, they would have been attacking him now.

Luo Tian sat cross-legged, closing his eyes to rest while waiting for the five’s battle to end.

“I’ll haunt you even as a ghost!” The last second-rate disciple’s cry echoed. The five dispersed, staring at each other and declaring the temporary alliance had officially ended.

At this moment, the spacious cave only held six young men and over a dozen corpses of Body-Refining Ninth Stage, emitting a heavy blood scent.

Luo Tian felt the five had finished. He slowly opened his eyes, stood up, and gazed at them with a serious expression. He could sense each of their strengths was far greater than Pei Letian at Body-Refining Ninth Stage.

Luo Tian didn’t dare to be careless. His Splitting Heaven Spear appeared instantly in his hand, and he stared at the five with a serious gaze.

“Will you come one by one or all together?” Luo Tian held the Splitting Heaven Spear, its black body glowing with a sinister blood-red hue. His voice was bold.

“You? Even deserve to be fought together?” Ying Hongtu sneered, his face filled with mockery.

But as soon as his words ended, his figure appeared behind Luo Tian, accompanied by a rolling thunder.

“Boom…”

The heavy sound echoed. Luo Tian felt Ying Hongtu’s speed and, without thinking, thrust his spear backward.

The thunderous sound echoed. Ying Hongtu returned to his spot, a drop of blood flowing from his fist. His face finally lost its mockery and bore a look of seriousness.

Others noticed Ying Hongtu’s change, their faces returning to solemnity. They knew this young man was definitely on par with them.

“Kill!” Ying Hongtu roared, his figure disappearing again.

“You’re mine!” Ying Hongtu’s words had barely finished when the other four also roared, rushing toward Luo Tian. However, during their run, they produced a battle sound.

Luo Tian initially thought the five would attack him together. If so, he had no chance of victory.

But when Luo Tian saw the five fighting while rushing toward him, he realized they weren’t a united alliance. They were also wary of each other.

“Then it’s easier now!” Luo Tian chuckled.

As he chuckled, the five’s battle had already reached him.

Luo Tian laughed aloud: “Today I’ll see what talent you all have—what makes you want to keep me here!”

With a laugh, Luo Tian held the Splitting Heaven Spear, radiating endless confidence. He joined the five’s attack range.

Chapter 150: Wang Siyuan Dies()

Chapter 150: Wang Siyuan Dies

The thunderous sounds echoed from five thousand zhang underground in the Great An Forest.

Dong Sansi and his companions had reached the surface, finding some second-rate disciples frantically collecting primordial energy stones.

Dong Sansi ordered Wang Tianxiang to lead the group into gathering primordial energy stones.

Dong Sansi stood at the cave entrance, his face showing concern. Though it was five thousand zhang away, he felt the terrifying waves from the cave entrance. He could sense how fierce the battle below was.

At this moment, six people were indeed in a brutal fight. Each was a prodigy of their time.

Initially, it was a six-way clash. Gradually, the battlefield split apart. Luo Tian’s strength had exceeded their expectations. Another person was also formidable—Chen Changsheng. Gradually, Luo Tian and Chen Changsheng became a one-on-two situation.

Wang Siyuan and Rong Da surrounded Luo Tian, while Bai Zhantian and Ying Hongtu attacked Chen Changsheng.

Luo Tian held the Splitting Heaven Spear, his hair loose. A myriad of snake-like shadows surged toward them. Rong Da waved a firestorm, enveloping Luo Tian and himself within it. Wang Siyuan seemed to vanish into the void, ready to strike Luo Tian with a fatal blow.

Seeing their tactics, Luo Tian coughed up blood. He planted his spear into the ground and changed his hands continuously, emitting a brilliant light from his three elements that illuminated the cave.

“Five Elements Mutual Generation, King’s Seal!” His seal flew out, directly targeting Rong Da in the firestorm.

Rong Da felt the intense light blinding his eyes. He closed them and swung a golden long sword, emitting endless slashes that struck the seal with a deafening hum.

“Boom…” The seal crashed down, scattering the firestorm.

Seeing his King’s Seal had no effect, Luo Tian showed no disappointment. But the hidden Wang Siyuan in the void was like a snake, slicing Luo Tian’s neck with a high-grade Yellow-ranked sword. It was silent and sudden.

“Xuan Yin Sect’s assassination technique! This Luo Tian is doomed!”

Rong Da, who had just resisted the King’s Seal, showed a hint of joy. He believed in Xuan Yin Sect’s assassination technique.

It was said that Wang Siyuan had assassinated a half-step Bone-Shattering Stage master at Body-Refining Eighth Stage and succeeded.

Luo Tian smiled coldly. His spiritual awareness had reached the peak, observing every move around him.

“Have you come out yet?” Luo Tian had long prepared the Soul-Stealing Seal, sending it toward the approaching shadow in his spiritual awareness.

Wang Siyuan had hidden using assassination techniques, but he didn’t know Luo Tian’s spiritual awareness had reached the peak. He hadn’t engaged him before to finish Rong Da first, then deal with Wang Siyuan.

Luo Tian had no choice but to face him. The Soul-Stealing Seal shot out swiftly.

At this moment, Wang Siyuan focused only on Luo Tian’s neck. He didn’t care about the terrifying waves in Luo Tian’s hands, thinking they were aimed at Rong Da.

“Boom…” The thunderous sound echoed again as Luo Tian’s Soul-Stealing Seal struck Wang Siyuan’s head.

Wang Siyuan’s head flew off like a ball, but his body still maintained the sword-wielding posture as it rushed toward Luo Tian.

“You killed Wang Siyuan!” Rong Da’s shocked voice echoed, his face filled with disbelief.

Luo Tian grabbed Wang Siyuan’s body and took the high-grade Yellow-ranked sword from his hand.

The other three fighting Chen Changsheng heard Rong Da’s disbelief and stopped their attacks, turning to look at Luo Tian’s battlefield.

Seeing the headless Wang Siyuan, their faces bore a hint of concern.

“Luo Tian! You’ve made a big mistake!” Rong Da’s face was grim, looking at Luo Tian. They knew Xuan Yin Sect too well.

Every member of Xuan Yin Sect was a cold-blooded killer. If someone dared to kill their people, even a lowly outer sect disciple, Xuan Yin Sect would retaliate endlessly. They’d start with the outer sect and move up—inner sect, disciples, elders, until they killed the person.

If there was anyone among them least willing to kill, it wasn’t Luo Tian, a top sect’s disciple. It was Wang Siyuan.

At this moment, the three stared at Luo Tian with a hint of schadenfreude.

“Hmph. If you want to kill me, be ready to face my counterattack!” Luo Tian said coldly. His eyes glowed with endless battle spirit, gazing at the remaining four.

“Correct. If you can’t survive, don’t blame others!” Chen Changsheng, now somewhat battered, had a bare dust brush.

“Yours!” The remaining three stared at these two strange men with shock.

“Luo Xiong, let’s join forces and eliminate these three together!” Chen Changsheng looked at Luo Tian with disdain, saying.

Hearing Chen Changsheng’s words, the three of Ying Hongtu felt their faces change. From their previous fight, they knew each of them couldn’t match these two alone. That was why they decided to attack one at a time, first eliminating the strongest before dealing with the others. But now Wang Siyuan had been killed by Luo Tian.

If these two joined forces, they would have the advantage in numbers but clearly not match their combined strength.

“Good!” Under the four’s gaze, Luo Tian nodded. He was tired of prolonged fighting and preferred to end it with just two left for a more efficient confrontation.

“Leave or die!” Hearing Luo Tian’s answer, Chen Changsheng looked at the three with a playful expression and said lowly.

“You!” The three of Ying Hongtu showed anger. Chen Changsheng’s words were what they had said to those they considered scum before.

Now, Chen Changsheng repeated them toward the three of Ying Hongtu—clearly viewing them as no better than scum.
