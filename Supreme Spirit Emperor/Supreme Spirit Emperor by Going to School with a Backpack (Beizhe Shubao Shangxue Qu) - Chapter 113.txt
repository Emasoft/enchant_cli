“Trivial trick! Kai Tian Axe, First Form!” Luo Feihong laughed heartily. His nine companions channeled their spiritual energy toward him, and a colossal axe shadow soared to the heavens, smashing into the golden waves.

“Destruction Life!” Luo Tian ignored the broken technique and closed in on Luo Feihong, launching a punch of annihilating power.

“Stay here!” Luo Feihong laughed again, undeterred. He struck with a fist that seemed to freeze all existence, sending Luo Tian the chilling sensation of time itself halting.

“Leave!” Luo Tian struck and withdrew instantly, his form flickering—but the Destruction Life Fist left no mark on Luo Feihong.

“Think you can flee so easily? Stay!” Luo Feihong’s hands moved, and his ice-element spiritual energy burst from his body, encasing Luo Tian in a cocoon that slowed him.

“Familiar sensation! If I wish to leave, none can stop me!” Luo Tian sneered, his wind and lightning elements surging beneath his feet. The Sixth Step of Sky-Blocking Step activated, and he vanished a hundred paces away.

“Wind and lightning elements! This brat has regained five elements, yet he’s gained two more!” The elders on the high platform gaped in shock, speechless as they watched Luo Tian.

“Seven-element constitution! I’ve never heard of such a thing in history!” A voice murmured among the crowd.

Luo Tian had now fully revealed his seven-element constitution, yet he bore no fear. He knew the more he excelled, the more the elders would value him.

The Luo Han faction had already finished their battle and stood among the crowd, watching. When they saw Luo Tian’s seven-element constitution, they inhaled sharply, their gazes shifting to Luo Han.

Luo Han possessed a four-element constitution—common knowledge—and had monopolized the clan’s resources through it. But now, a seven-element constitution emerged. The elders would surely pour the entire sect’s resources into nurturing Luo Tian, for he was still a Luo clan member. Though investigations revealed he was a disciple of the Five Elements Sect and even held the position of Young Master in the Eastern Domain’s Spirit Summoning Sect, his blood still flowed with that of the Luo clan. His parents remained deep within Ice Pole Island, guarding a seal.

Luo Han’s face darkened. If he had underestimated Luo Tian before, now he regarded him as a rival—perhaps even more gifted than himself.

Luo Tian’s seven-colored wings erupted behind him, forming a rainbow that soared into the sky. His eyes gleamed with resolve: “Since my identity is exposed, I’ll reveal it fully!”

He raised a wisp of emerald flame, casting an eerie glow over his face.

Chapter 553: Full Exposure

Green fire dragons spiraled from Luo Tian’s hands, circling above Luo Feihong and his group. They roared with terrifying intensity.

“What is this flame?” The elders gaped, their expressions grim as they stared at the ominous fire within the barrier.

“This… this is the Three Ancestral Flames of the Eastern Domain’s Dan Sect—Emerald Crystal Glaze Flame!” One elder gasped, his face pale with disbelief.

“Ancestral Flames of the Dan Sect! How could these ancient relics, hoarded by those old bastards, end up in this brat’s hands?” The elders marveled.

“The flames are terrifying, but the technique is weak—why is it only a lower-tier move?” A young man in Luo Feihong’s group questioned.

Yet Luo Feihong’s gaze was grave. Though others felt no threat, he sensed the emerald flame’s overwhelming power.

“Ten… a hundred…” A hundred fire dragons erupted from Luo Tian’s hands, leaving him pale.

“Kai Tian Axe—Third Form!” Luo Feihong roared, overwhelmed by the emerald flame’s pressure. He unleashed his ultimate technique.

A gray axe shadow sliced through the void, cleaving the sky itself.

“Fen Tian! Li Fire Formation!” Luo Tian stood in the heavens, slamming his hands into the air.

“Pang… pang…” The fire dragons shattered one by one, transforming into a raging inferno that fell upon Luo Feihong’s ten-man formation.

The searing heat consumed the barrier instantly, and within moments, it shattered with a thunderous crash.

“Absolute Zero!” Luo Feihong bellowed, his ice-element spiritual energy surging.

At the same time, his nine companions bore grim expressions, their power exploding as they felt the fire’s terror. They had no choice but to unleash all their ice-element energy.

Cold air radiated from the ten, momentarily halting the inferno’s might. A sneering aura emanated from the flames.

“Go!” Luo Tian pressed his hands downward again, and a surge of wood-element energy erupted from him, merging with the fire. The emerald flames surged further, pressing against Luo Feihong’s group.

“Break!” Luo Feihong roared, his ice-element energy forming a long sword that sliced through the fire.

“Sizzle…” The barrier instantly filled with steam, obscuring sight.

At the same time, the sky split as the Kai Tian Axe shadow descended upon Luo Tian.

“Three Lives Soul-Subduing!” Luo Tian sneered, a small cauldron the size of a palm flying from his hand. It pressed over his head, radiating pressure.

The gray axe clashed with the Soul-Subduing Cauldron, and a deafening explosion erupted. The ground seethed with fire and steam.

The crowd’s faces were etched with shock, watching the obscured barrier. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to unleash such terrifying power!

“Brilliant youth!” The elders murmured, their gazes fixed on the barrier.

Luo Han’s face darkened completely. Luo Tian was now the star of the event, and his revealed strength had left Luo Han in awe.

The steam dissipated, and the crowd’s eyes turned to the barrier. Green flames coiled around Luo Feihong’s group, preventing them from moving. Their faces were pale, fear in their eyes as they faced the fire dragons.

Above, a bronze cauldron hung heavily, rotating slowly. Luo Tian smiled faintly beneath it, gazing at Luo Feihong’s group.

“Luo Tian!”

“Glory!” Lu Qingqing and Lu Wu, Lu Zhen, and others cheered loudly, watching Luo Tian standing proudly in the sky.

“He did it!”

“Since Ice Pole Island’s founding, no one has ever faced ten opponents alone!” The crowd murmured in awe.

The Luo Zhan faction’s people glowed with fierce eyes, some elders even shedding tears. Luo Tian’s boldness had reignited their hope for the clan’s former glory.

“Surrender!” Luo Feihong’s face was ashen. He had finally yielded to Luo Tian, who now surpassed even Luo Han in strength. The surrounding flames made him and his companions tremble.

“Huff…” Hearing Luo Feihong’s surrender, Luo Tian inhaled deeply, retracting the Emerald Crystal Glaze Flame and storing the Soul-Subduing Cauldron in his ring.

He descended slowly to the ground, bowing to Luo Feihong: “My apologies.”

Hearing this, Luo Feihong and his group’s mouths twitched. Their faces flushed as they exited the barrier. Today, their faction had suffered a major humiliation. They hadn’t even made the top five. Though other rankings held little meaning, they hoped their clan might climb slightly to avoid embarrassment.

“Who could have predicted Luo Tian’s absurd strength? He led the weakest faction to become a黑马, the biggest one of all! People now equate him with Luo Han.”

The thunderous sounds echoed from other barriers. Luo Tian stood surrounded by Lu Qingqing, recovering his overexerted spiritual energy.

“If my guess is correct, our next opponent will be Luo Han. If we win this round, our faction will be first! If we lose, we can only hope Luo Zhan’s clan leader takes the top spot!” Lu Qingqing whispered.

“Thank you all. I hope we claim first place. I’ve always believed in seizing our fate! My destiny is mine to command, not the heavens’!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice calm but resolute.

“Next round! Begin!” As Luo Tian’s words faded, his group felt the surge of teleportation power.

Chapter 554: Eight Gates Ice Crystal Ruler

“Indeed!” Luo Tian smiled, gazing at the ten opponents.

Lu Qingqing’s group stiffened as they saw Luo Han, their expressions darkening with battle intent.

Lu Wu and Lu Zhen’s bodies trembled slightly, their eyes burning with fervor as they stared at the ten.

Luo Han’s face gleamed coldly, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian. Behind him stood Lu Xing’an, whose eyes were equally icy.

The humiliation Luo Tian and Xu Liyi had once inflicted on him lingered in his mind.

At present, Xu Liyi and Chen Zhanbiao couldn’t participate due to not being clan members. But Lu Xing’an had transferred all his hatred onto Luo Tian.

Like Lu Xing’an, every young man behind Luo Han bore battle intent. Their faction was the direct lineage; this competition should have shone brightly, but Luo Tian’s emergence had disrupted it. Their direct lineage status might even be at risk.

“Need a rest?” Luo Han’s face wore his habitual smile, his posture aloof as he addressed Luo Tian.

Luo Han was proud; he didn’t want to defeat a weakened Luo Tian, for it would harm his undefeated mindset. Though he had previously lost to Luo Tian, he hadn’t fully revealed his strength.

“No need. I’m fine,” Luo Tian shook his head, his expression indifferent. He understood Luo Han’s mindset and sighed inwardly—these prodigies were truly arrogant.

If it were him, he’d seize the opportunity to finish an opponent without mercy, leaving no chance for recovery.

“Let’s change the rules! How about a three-on-three battle?” Luo Han’s eyes gleamed with combat spirit, eager to defeat Luo Tian without external interference.

“Huh?” Luo Tian and Lu Qingqing didn’t understand, frowning.

“We each send three to fight! Two wins out of three?” Luo Han smiled confidently, believing Luo Tian would accept. His side had an absolute advantage: only two were in the Soul-Formation Realm, while others were at its peak.

Hearing Luo Han’s words, not only did Luo Tian’s group hesitate but so did the onlookers. They marveled at Luo Han’s move.

“Luo Han is seeking a fair duel with Luo Tian!”

“He truly is the undefeated prodigy! We can’t match him!” The crowd murmured.

Luo Tian narrowed his eyes, thinking Luo Han’s condition seemed favorable for them but in his view, it held no real advantage.

Lu Zhen and Lu Wu’s strength was slightly inferior to their opponents, while Lu Qingqing, now at Soul-Formation Realm peak, matched Lu Xing’an. If he won, it would be a tie; if he lost, their chance at first place was gone.

In this case, it was better to go all-in with a team battle, aided by formations.

Lu Zhen and Lu Wu showed no expression, waiting for Luo Tian’s decision—clearly, they’d accept whatever he chose.

Seeing the crowd’s gaze on him, Luo Tian smiled faintly, his lips curling: “Fine.”

“Boom…” The crowd watched Luo Tian and Luo Han with anticipation, eager to witness their clash again. Their previous physical combat had left them exhilarated, though Luo Tian had lost. But clearly, that battle hadn’t used techniques—so it wasn’t a true showdown.

They wanted to see if anyone could truly defeat their myth.

“Good!” Luo Han smiled, stepping forward. Lu Xing’an and another cold-faced youth stood behind him.

Luo Tian shrugged indifferently, stepping forward. Lu Qingqing followed closely. After discussing, Lu Zhen and Lu Wu decided to let Lu Wu fight.

“Brother, give us some honor!” Lu Zhen patted Lu Wu’s shoulder, whispering.

“Don’t worry. I won’t disgrace our faction!” Lu Wu’s face hardened, stepping behind Luo Tian.

“Begin! I suppose everyone knows who they’ll fight. No objections, then let’s start!”

Luo Han spoke softly, his feet moving swiftly toward Luo Tian.

“Lu Xing’an! I’ve been dominated by you before—today, let’s see if you have the qualifications!” Lu Qingqing sneered, rushing toward Lu Xing’an.

At the same time, Lu Wu transformed into a meteor, charging at the remaining youth.

“Overconfident!” The youth sneered, drawing a glimmering long sword that radiated coldness toward Lu Wu.

Luo Tian activated Sky-Blocking Step, gripping his spear, and rushed toward Luo Han. His eyes held no contempt as he launched “Gold Stone Breaks Open,” piercing Luo Han.

Seeing Luo Tian use a technique immediately, Luo Han sneered and summoned an ice crystal ruler.

“Eight Gates Ice Crystal Ruler!” The crowd gasped as Luo Han revealed his weapon. No one had ever seen him use it so early, not even top sect prodigies. But now, against Luo Tian, he had drawn it immediately.

The ruler swung, releasing a violent energy that deflected Luo Tian’s attack.

“Pang…” The spear and ruler clashed, emitting a piercing sound. A thin crack formed on the spear, sending shockwaves through Luo Tian’s body.

They both retreated instantly, their spiritual energy wings unfurling as they soared into the sky. Their eyes held grim determination.

“Evenly matched!” The onlookers gasped, staring at the two figures standing proudly in the sky.

They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to block Luo Han’s attack so effectively, matching him without falling behind. They knew Luo Tian was strong, but seeing it firsthand was another matter.

“Good!” Luo Han smiled, his ruler swinging again as he barked: “Eight Gates Ice Crystal Ruler!” He then hurled the ruler into the sky.

Chapter 555: Lu Wu’s Defeat

Luo Han’s words echoed, and the Eight Gates Ice Crystal Ruler glowed with cold light. It split into two, then four, instantly forming eight rulers that circled above him.

“Go!” Luo Han barked, and the eight ice dragons surged toward Luo Tian, freezing space with their howls.

“Gold Stone Breaks Open!” Luo Tian’s brow furrowed, his spear shadows forming a golden ocean that collided with the eight dragons.

Explosions erupted as both techniques clashed, their overwhelming power shaking the barrier and echoing through it.

“Four Symbols’ Power!” Luo Han barked again, summoning four ancient demon elephants that merged into his body.

He kicked off the ground, appearing beside the ice rulers and slamming them down on Luo Tian. This strike carried all of Luo Han’s cultivation, his physical strength, and his pride.

Cracks splintered across the ruler’s surface, emitting icy coldness.

Luo Tian was awestruck but raised his spear high, eyes wild as he met Luo Han’s devastating strike.

“Crack…” The ruler and spear collided with a deafening roar, blood trickling from Luo Tian’s lips as his legs sank into the ground.

“Boom…” The crowd was stunned by their battle, their strength surpassing the Soul-Formation Realm. If they were stronger by a little, they’d rival even the initial stages of the Soul-Sundering Realm.

“You lost this time!” Luo Han retreated, his hands trembling from the backlash.

But Luo Tian was more battered; his spear fell to the ground with a clear sound.

“Truly strong!” Luo Tian’s heart trembled. Luo Han was incredibly powerful, exceeding his expectations. Though their levels differed—Luo Han at Soul-Formation Realm peak and Luo Tian at its end—he had never before faced an opponent just one level above him who forced him into such a desperate situation.

He pulled his legs from the ground, shaking his numb hands, his face glowing with excitement. Luo Han was strong, but so was he. If this small setback made him give up, he wouldn’t be Luo Tian.

“Boom…” As Luo Tian’s battle spirit flared, a dull sound echoed—Lu Wu fell to the ground, his face pale.

“Haha! You dare challenge me? A foolish dream!” The youth opposing Lu Wu sneered, laughing loudly.

Lu Wu struggled to rise, his eyes wild as he stared at the youth above him, his face ashen.

Though Lu Wu had ascended to Soul-Formation Realm peak with Luo Tian’s pills and water dragon meat, he still lagged behind the current young prodigies of Luo Han’s faction.

“I cannot lose… I will not lose!” Lu Wu’s eyes turned blood-red, fixated on the youth above.

“Don’t resist; you’re not my match. Your faction will forever be beneath ours!” The youth’s gaze was arrogant, looking at both Lu Wu and the battles between Luo Han and Lu Xing’an.

Seeing Lu Xing’an and Lu Qingqing evenly matched, and Luo Han currently in the lead, he felt even more triumphant. If this continued, their faction would surely win this round.

“I will not lose!” Lu Wu seemed to ignore the youth’s words, his eyes blood-red as he stared at the sky. His lips murmured repeatedly.

“Crack…” Without hesitation, Lu Wu bit his finger, a drop of blood floating into the air.

“Burning blood? He’s gone mad!” The crowd gaped in disbelief.

At the Soul-Formation Realm, one had gained the world’s approval; thus, their blood was also approved. Burning it made recovery far more difficult than in the Bone-Formation Realm.

“In three drops!” The crowd was stunned as three blood droplets floated before Lu Wu.

Luo Tian frowned, instantly appearing beside Lu Wu and reaching out with a cold “Return!”

As Luo Tian’s words echoed, the three blood droplets seemed to obey his command, returning into Lu Wu’s body.

The youth’s sneer faded as he snapped back to reality, gazing at Luo Tian with confusion.

“Leave the rest to us!” Luo Tian whispered, knowing Lu Wu had already given his all. To let him suffer further would be unwise. If there was no alternative, he’d have to seek his parents’ help.

But Luo Tian knew his parents hadn’t appeared, their goal being to let him lead the clan’s rise through his own strength. He wouldn’t abandon even a small chance, for he didn’t want to disappoint them.

“Luo Tian, I can still fight!” Lu Wu’s face bore frustration as he spoke.

“Listen to me. Trust me,” Luo Tian gently patted Lu Wu’s shoulder.

“We concede this round!” Luo Tian spoke softly, addressing the youth above to let Lu Wu rest.

Seeing Luo Tian’s confident gaze and Lu Qingqing still battling in the sky, Lu Wu sighed, nodded, and walked into the crowd.

“Brother, well done! You’ve improved greatly from before. You’ve given your all!” Lu Zhen laughed, comforting Lu Wu.

“Yes! Brother Lu Wu, you’ve given your all!” Others smiled and comforted him as well.

As the crowd’s gazes met Lu Wu, a strange feeling stirred in his heart. He felt the clan had changed slightly from before.

“Kid, stop being sentimental! I don’t have time!” Luo Han’s impatient voice echoed in Luo Tian’s ears.

“Fine, I can’t afford to lose again—then I’d have no chance at all!” Luo Tian smiled faintly, his wings bursting forth as he took position opposite Luo Han in the sky.

“You kept me waiting! I’ll start now!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his fingers moving swiftly.

Chapter 556: Eight Treasures Glazed Lamp

“Five Elements’ Mutual Generation! King’s Seal!”
“Soul-Stealing Seal!” Luo Tian sneered, launching the King’s Seal and Soul-Stealing Seal.

Five-colored golden seals emerged from Luo Tian’s hands, emitting a piercing hum as they flew toward Luo Han.

Luo Tian had entered the Soul-Formation Realm, and the King’s Seal’s power had grown terrifyingly. Yet it posed no real threat to Luo Han.

Luo Han swung his ruler, blocking the King’s Seal—but the Soul-Stealing Seal followed closely. That was Luo Tian’s secret weapon.

Luo Tian’s spiritual awareness had reached the Gathering-Element Realm, and the Soul-Stealing Seal’s power had transformed drastically. Those with low spiritual awareness couldn’t sense its presence.

Even Luo Han could only vaguely feel a terrifying wave approaching but couldn’t see the soul-sealing seal.

Luo Han’s lips curled slightly, and he suddenly held a bronze lamp. Though aged, its patterns had faded with time.

Yet as the lamp appeared, Luo Tian’s expression shifted slightly. He could clearly sense its terrifying aura, akin to the Soul-Subduing Cauldron’s oppressive pressure.

“Eight Treasures Glazed Lamp! I never thought Luo Han could obtain such a blessing, earning the lamp’s recognition!” The elders gaped in surprise, watching Luo Han’s bronze lamp.

At the same time, Luo Tian’s Soul-Stealing Seal reached Luo Han, emitting a terrifying wave as it slammed toward him.

Feeling the seal’s presence, the lamp’s wick flared suddenly, creating an invisible barrier around Luo Han.

“Pang…” The Soul-Stealing Seal collided with the barrier, rebounding toward Luo Tian.

“Rebound?” Luo Tian’s eyes widened in shock. He knew his seal’s power, yet he hadn’t expected the lamp’s barrier to not only block it but also return it.

“Luo Tian, this lamp’s defense is unbreakable. In the ancient times, if a Soul-Sundering or Gathering-Element Realm master used it, it would create absolute defense, blocking any attack!” Luo Han sneered, speaking softly to Luo Tian.

“Absolute defense?” Hearing this, Luo Tian felt heavy, his gaze questioning as he looked at Luo Han, now wrapped in a golden barrier.

“I don’t believe anything is absolute!” Luo Tian sneered, his body soaring into the sky above Luo Han.

A palm-sized cauldron appeared in Luo Tian’s hand, his gaze fixed on Luo Han. He gently tossed it.

“Boom…” The Soul-Subduing Cauldron seemed to sense the lamp’s presence, roaring with a deafening sound. A pressure capable of subduing all things formed instantly from the cauldron.

“Hmm?” As the Soul-Subduing Cauldron appeared, Luo Han noticed something unnatural about the Eight Treasures Glazed Lamp. Even its wick’s flame had slight tremors, as if it could be extinguished at any moment.

“The Soul-Subduing Cauldron! It’s an ancient relic famed for its power!” The elders gaped, watching the cauldron in the sky.

Previously, when Luo Tian used it, it had only shown itself briefly; the elders hadn’t paid much attention. But now, with the cauldron fully revealed, they finally recognized its true identity.

“Fate?” One elder sighed, gazing at the Soul-Subduing Cauldron beneath Luo Tian and the Eight Treasures Glazed Lamp in Luo Han’s hands.

In ancient times, both relics were renowned—yet they differed vastly. The Soul-Subduing Cauldron could subdue all, rendering any defense useless. The Eight Treasures Glazed Lamp was famed for absolute defense, unbreakable once its wick was lit.

In ancient times, there had been attempts to pit them against each other, but the Tianyuan Continent was vast. The two relics had never met, yet today they clashed within their clan, sparking the elders’ intense interest.

The surrounding crowd didn’t know of the relics’ history but felt their ancient aura and a faint connection.

“Foes?” Both Luo Tian and Luo Han felt the same sense, gazing at their respective relics.

“Go!” Sensing the cauldron’s excitement, Luo Tian smiled and pressed it.

“Boom…” A thunderous sound echoed as the Soul-Subduing Cauldron soared above the Eight Treasures Glazed Lamp’s barrier.

As the enemy approached, the lamp’s wick flared violently, expanding its golden barrier further.

Under everyone’s expectant gaze, the Soul-Subduing Cauldron collided with the golden barrier, producing a deafening explosion that made people’s ears ring.

Even the two relics’ masters—Luo Tian and Luo Han—turned pale, their gazes filled with awe as they watched the collision.

A hundred-foot crack rose from the point of impact, and this clash’s power rivaled that of a Soul-Sundering Realm battle.

“I’ll help you!” Seeing the relics’ stalemate, Luo Tian’s hand held a blue longbow—Luo Mother’s mid-tier earth-grade bow.

“Hum…” The Soul-Subduing Cauldron emitted a rejection, as if angered. Its massive body dropped three more feet under the barrier’s pressure.

“Crack…” Under the cauldron’s immense pressure, the Eight Treasures Glazed Lamp’s barrier finally developed fine cracks, slowly dispersing.

“Impossible!” Luo Han’s face was stunned, his gaze on the nearly shattered barrier as he shouted.

The lamp in Luo Han’s hands seemed wounded, its wick flame instantly extinguishing.

As the flame died out, the golden barrier shattered with a thunderous crash. The Soul-Subduing Cauldron’s massive body landed on the ground with a heavy sound.

“The victor has been decided!” The elders’ faces bore admiration, watching the cauldron. They had never expected this clash across several eras to occur in such a setting, witnessed only by them.

Chapter 557: Premature Conclusion

The Soul-Subduing Cauldron stood in the crowd’s view, emitting a thunderous hum. A proud aura stirred within people, as if proclaiming its victory and claiming to be the sole ruler of heaven and earth.

Luo Han stared in disbelief at the cauldron beside him, his face stunned as he whispered: “Impossible.”

“Kai Tian!” As Luo Han murmured, a cold voice echoed in the crowd. The sky darkened instantly with clouds, and the Kai Tian Seal sliced through the void, appearing in their sight.

The golden “Tian” seal radiated overwhelming authority, striking Luo Han’s head with a thunderous crash.

“Boom…” A deafening sound echoed again as the golden seal landed on Luo Han, and his figure vanished from sight, crushed like a pancake.

“Did he get killed?” Lu Wu and Lu Zhen’s faces lit up with excitement, watching the golden seal slowly dissipate.

“No! How could Luo Han lose?” Lu Xing’an, still battling Lu Qingqing, gaped in disbelief.

“Nobody is invincible!” Lu Qingqing sneered, her three-colored hands slamming into Lu Xing’an’s chest.

Their strengths were nearly equal; now that Lu Xing’an was stunned, Lu Qingqing wouldn’t miss the chance.

“Puk!” Lu Qingqing and Lu Xing’an’s battle had reached its peak. Lu Xing’an, struck by Lu Qingqing’s full power, was knocked to the ground like a fly, coughing blood.

“Lu Qingqing wins!” The crowd gasped at the dramatic result. Just moments ago, Luo Han’s faction had held the advantage, but now they were at a disadvantage. Lu Xing’an spat blood to the ground, and Luo Han was crushed under the Kai Tian Seal.

The crowd’s thoughts turned to a more shocking result: if both Luo Tian and Lu Qingqing won, their faction would be the undeniable first in this round. That meant they’d claim both the Soul-Formation and team battles, leaving the Soul-Sundering Realm’s match irrelevant.

“Brutal! Truly brutal!” The crowd murmured, gazing at Luo Tian. This youth, back in the clan for less than a month, had saved the Luo Zhan faction from being expelled from Ice Pole Island and might even become a direct lineage.

“Impossible!” The young members of Luo Han’s faction cried out, watching the dissipating Kai Tian Seal. To them, Luo Han was as revered as Luo Tian had been in the Five Elements Sect.

But today, their god had been defeated by a man they looked down on—a peasant who defied belief.

“Strong! Even in this situation, he still has the will to fight!” Luo Tian stood atop the sky, his face showing respect.

Luo Tian nodded inwardly. Luo Han was truly the leader of Ice Pole Island; his strength was the greatest among young prodigies he had faced. Even those who had nearly killed him before might not match Luo Han’s power.
