The cold gleam flashed, instantly appearing before Luo. Luo's eyes locked onto the glint of steel and glimpsed the figure who had struck.

"Cheng Ping!" Luo's face darkened. At this moment, his internal energy was chaotic; if he forced a strike, he would suffer great damage.

"Wang An!" No one expected Cheng Ping to suddenly attack at this moment. Yao Chen, Diao Dezhu and others were locked in battle with Lei Yun Huang, leaving no chance to aid Luo.

In the blink of an eye, a chilling spear tip appeared at Luo's chest, poised to pierce his heart.

Puuu...

But as Luo felt the spear tip enter his chest and prepared to strike desperately, a figure suddenly appeared at his side, grasping Cheng Ping's spear.

Ding ling ling...

The sound of bells rang out. A round, plump figure stood beside Luo, smiling with a serene expression. His gaze locked onto Cheng Ping - it was Sun Kinen, who had always been enigmatic.

Yet now, Sun Kinen's aura was immensely powerful. His formerly plump body seemed to have grown taller.

"Immortal King Peak!" Everyone gasped in astonishment, even Luo's face reflected disbelief.

"You... what do you intend to do?" Sun Kinen spoke, his voice cold. His fingers tightened, and Cheng Ping's spear bent violently. A gust of wind surged toward Cheng Ping.

Crack...

Cheng Ping finally lost grip on his spear, his body recoiling. He spat blood and was blasted backward by the overwhelming force, falling onto the rain-soaked ground.

"What's going on?" Luo stared intently at Sun Kinen. This was not the Sun Kinen he had known.

Sun Kinen opened his mouth, inhaling. The earth trembled as a vortex formed above his head, drawing energy into him.

Boom boom boom

Thunderous noises echoed from Sun Kinen's body. All eyes widened as his aura solidified at the Immortal King Peak.

"You! Who are you!" Luo spoke, knowing Sun Kinen must have used some forbidden technique to achieve this state.

"I am not important. What matters is that only I can help you now!" Sun Kinen chuckled, gazing at Luo.

At the same time, Sun Kinen extended his hand to grasp Cheng Ping. Cheng Ping's face contorted in panic.

"Equality of All Beings!" Cheng Ping roared, pulling out a black talisman and sticking it to his body. His aura suddenly surged, as if establishing some connection with Sun Kinen.

Sun Kinen's eyes flickered with contemplation. His body trembled, and a storm swirled between him and Cheng Ping, seemingly breaking their connection.

"This technique might work on others, but not on me!" Sun Kinen chuckled. He took a step forward and appeared before Cheng Ping, then struck with his palm.

Crack...

Cheng Ping's head shattered like a melon, leaving people horrified. Blood splattered onto Sun Kinen's face, adding a savage edge to his appearance.

"Kill!" After finishing this, Sun Kinen soared into the air toward Lei Yun Huang. A bell's sound echoed in Ye Qiu and others' ears.

With Sun Kinen, Diao Dezhu, and Ye Chen, they finally caught their breath. That brief confrontation had already pushed them to their limits; without Sun Kinen, they might have already perished.

Sun Kinen's aura was formidable. He gestured, sending a string of talismans wrapping around Lei Yun Huang, causing the latter's face to slightly change.

"Binding Soul Curse!"

"You are who?" Lei Yun Huang asked, his aura surging with overwhelming power to resist the talisman chains.

"Subdue!" Bu Shi appeared, pressing onto Lei Yun Huang's body. The latter finally fell from the sky, crashing into the rain-soaked ground.

Boom...

The earth trembled. Luo and others felt their feet shake, as if the world itself was about to shatter.

"Even with our secret techniques, this battle is beyond us!" The people of the Immortal and Hell realms were terrified. They watched as the talisman chains snapped again, and Lei Yun Huang's aura surged once more.

As people gaped in awe, Luo's Demon Dissolution finally completed. His aura surged with power, and he burst into the air toward Lei Yun Huang.

Break Through Spear!

Having reached Immortal King Peak, Luo's strength had ascended another level. The power of Break Through Spear increased significantly. Lei Yun Huang's face finally changed; though he was comparable to a half-step Immortal Emperor, compared to a true half-step Immortal Emperor, he was still lacking. Luo, Sun Kinen, and Bu Shi were all at Immortal King Peak - they needed to face him fully.

Buzz...

Lei Yun Huang extended his hand, an invisible wave appearing before him. Luo's spear tip froze in place. Finally, Lei Yun Huang's body retreated.

"Die!" Bu Shi roared, a massive stone descending through the sky to crush Lei Yun Huang.

Sun Kinen also shook his copper bell, emitting a clear sound. Strange waves enveloped Lei Yun Huang.

"Open!" Lei Yun Huang bellowed, grabbing Luo's shattered spear with one hand and striking Bu Shi with the other. He sent Bu Shi flying while thunderous sounds clashed against the strange bell's sound.

Boom boom boom...

The deafening explosions echoed across the land. Under people's terrified gazes, Luo and three others fought against Lei Yun Huang. Though they were three Immortal King Peak masters, Lei Yun Huang faced them without fear - though the danger was much greater than before when Yao Chen had fought him.

"So terrifying! Three peak masters!" Everyone watched the seemingly invincible Lei Yun Huang, the third person they had seen who could fight three Immortal King Peak masters simultaneously. The first was Gu Shu and the蛮王.

"What do we do? Luo's group can't lose, or we won't have a good fate!" Jiang Yuzhe shouted to the people of Hell and Immortals. At this moment, they were few in number. Who could have imagined a world would hold such danger?

Time slowly passed. Luo and his group's battle had reached its peak. Each of their attacks was overwhelmingly powerful, but Lei Yun Huang could withstand them all. Though he suffered some injuries, his immortal skin blocked the damage. Lei Yun Huang's losses were only in soul energy.

"An entire skin is so powerful?" Luo spat blood, gazing at Lei Yun Huang who had been pressed back to the ground.

"It's a world treasure. He once specifically cultivated his body!" Bu Shi replied, his stone skin constantly falling off, his aura dimming slightly from the exhaustion.

Chapter 2759: Can't Die()

Thunderous lightning swept across, Lei Yun Huang stood proudly in the sky, his gaze sweeping over Luo and his group.

"Is that all you've got?" Lei Yun Huang sneered, slapping Bu Shi away with one hand. His hands moved swiftly.

"Too much energy consumed. I don't want to waste time with you anymore!" Lei Yun Huang spoke, a terrifying aura radiating from his hands.

Crash...

Seven-color lightning appeared in Lei Yun Huang's hands. The sky darkened with clouds, each bolt of lightning containing destructive power.

"Thunder Punishment to Destroy the World!" A cold voice echoed from Lei Yun Huang. He was bathed in seven-color lightning, and instantly, countless bolts of lightning struck Luo and Sun Kinen.

"Damn it!" Sun Kinen cursed, staring at the seven-color lightning with fear in his eyes.

A crack echoed as a purple bolt struck Sun Kinen's body, sending smoke rising from him.

"Haha! You're a ghost spirit. The most feared thing is the world's supreme yang. My lightning is your weakness!" Lei Yun Huang laughed, understanding why Sun Kinen was so powerful.

"Unexpectedly, there's someone like you. Submit to me, and I might spare your life!" Lei Yun Huang spoke, sending several bolts of lightning toward Sun Kinen.

Boom boom boom...

Sun Kinen kept retreating, defending himself. But his body still smoked constantly, and people could clearly hear the painful screams from within his body.

"Ghost Spirit Body!" Bu Shi realized, shouting in alarm.

Destructive lightning struck Luo. Luo opened his Thunder Yang Eye, twisting bolts of lightning before him. But some still hit Luo's body, leaving him in a terrible state.

This lightning was too strong. Even with his Thunder Cloud Flower and Thunder Yang Eye, Luo couldn't withstand it. At this moment, Lei Yun Huang was like the master of lightning, each bolt obeying his command.

"God damn it!" Sun Kinen roared. His aura was weakening, and he seemed to have reverted back to his usual self. His body grew darker until finally, he couldn't hold on and fell from the sky, his aura weak to the extreme.

"Bu Shi, save him!" Luo shouted, trying to rescue Sun Kinen but was blocked by countless lightning bolts.

"Master, it's not that I don't want to save him. I can't get there either!" Bu Shi shouted, his condition no better than Luo's, flying around from the countless lightning strikes.

"Help! You're just watching me die!" Sun Kinen shouted, his body still being struck by lightning, about to be split apart.

Buzz...

Just as Sun Kinen was about to fall to the ground, a purple figure appeared beside him and grabbed him. It was Diao Dezhu.

" Wang An, you should really lose some weight!" Diao Dezhu cursed. Even with his speed, he was struck by lightning and both fell onto the rain-soaked ground.

As soon as they landed, Diao Dezhu stood up and positioned himself in front of Sun Kinen.

"I told you a long time ago to stop tomb robbing. That's bad luck. Now you're getting struck by lightning!" Diao Dezhu cursed, spitting blood but standing in front of Sun Kinen.

Diao Dezhu and Sun Kinen often bickered, but they both admitted they were the best of friends.

Within a few breaths, Diao Dezhu was barely alive and collapsed onto Sun Kinen. Both were trembling from the lightning strikes.

"Roar..." Chen Zhanbiao roared, rushing into the lightning with his invincible body and appearing before Diao Dezhu and Sun Kinen.

One second... ten seconds...

Chen Zhanbiao didn't last a hundred seconds and fell like Diao Dezhu and Sun Kinen, gazing toward Luo's direction.

"Ahh..." Luo roared, his eyes red. He watched Chen Zhanbiao and the others lying there but could do nothing to rescue them. Also, Yao Chen had rushed in to defend Sun Kinen and others.

Ye Qiu and others were moved, watching Yao Chen and the others one after another rushing into that destructive lightning. If it had been them, they wouldn't have done so.

"I envy these people!" Ye Qiu sighed. They had always been lonely as disciples, with no true friends by their side. From the moment they rose to power, there had been competition and deceit.

"This is brotherhood!" Zhou Zhiwen sighed, looking at Wan Lingkong outside the lightning. At this moment, Yao Chen was also struggling to hold back.

"Damn it, formation complete!" Wan Lingkong roared, his golden command flag swirling. Hundreds of thousands of golden talismans radiated waves. Wan Lingkong held a main flag, rushing into the lightning.

As Wan Lingkong entered, a wave radiated from his talismans. A storm formed into a powerful whirlwind, sweeping the ground.

To everyone's shock, those destructive lightning bolts could be redirected by the storm.

Wan Lingkong reached near them and finally let Yao Chen sigh in relief. If Wan Lingkong had arrived a moment later, he would have also been unable to hold on.

"Quickly, take them out. I can't last long!" Wan Lingkong's face was pale, spitting blood that splattered onto the trembling talismans, stabilizing them.

Yao Chen didn't hesitate. He lifted Chen Zhanbiao and Diao Dezhu, while Wan Lingkong dragged Sun Kinen. The two used their strength to lead the three out of the lightning.

"Wind? I hate wind!" Lei Yun Huang stood there, watching Wan Lingkong avoid his attack. This made Lei Yun Huang uncomfortable.

Lei Yun Huang extended his hand, five thick bolts of lightning descended and entwined together. They rushed toward the storm above Wan Lingkong's head.

Those destructive storms had no resistance against the thick lightning dragons, and they shattered instantly above Wan Lingkong's head.

Crack...

Blood-colored talismans shattered in Wan Lingkong's hands. The talismans he had previously set up also cracked one by one.

It wasn't that Wan Lingkong's formation was weak. With the power of that storm, it could have destroyed an Immortal King Late Stage without a problem. Even an Immortal King Peak would need some effort to deal with it. But Lei Yun Huang was a half-step Immortal Emperor, and the gap was too great.

The lightning dragons still surged forward, striking Wan Lingkong and Yao Chen. Their faces turned pale.

"This time, we really are done for!" Wan Lingkong's face wore a bitter smile, sensing the approach of death.

"Can't die!" Just as Wan Lingkong smiled bitterly, Luo finally appeared near them under the furious lightning.

Chapter 2760: Bu Tianxin()

Five-color lightning entwined, carrying heavenly might as it descended. Luo Tian's eyes flashed with madness. He clenched his fist, and six轮回 punches were suddenly unleashed, striking the five-color lightning.

Boom... The five-color lightning was shattered by Luo Tian. His body was struck by a powerful force, his eyes also bleeding as he resisted the residual attack of Lei Yun Huang.

Luo Tian spat blood, gazing at Wan Lingkong and others: "Run!"

Luo Tian barked orders. The dazed Wan Lingkong and others regained their senses, quickly standing up.

"Run!" Luo Tian spoke, continuously unleashing six轮回 punches to destroy countless destructive lightning bolts. He led Yao Chen and others out of the lightning.

"Truly, like a cockroach's tenacity!" Lei Yun Huang sighed, his palm emitting lightning again. Five-color lightning rushed toward Luo Tian and others.

"This time, Luo Tian will die!" Seeing Lei Yun Huang strike again, people outside trembled. This was a soul-level instinctive fear they had only felt when weak.

"Luo Tian, run!" Wan Lingkong shouted at Luo Tian who kept defending. But then he felt bitter.

They knew Luo Tian. If he left now, he wouldn't be the Luo Tian they knew.

Crash... Luo Tian stood in place. At the same time, three-color lightning appeared in his hands, radiating an astonishing aura.

"Thunder Cloud Flower's lightning? You dare to oppose my thunder punishment with your thunder cloud flower's lightning? That's naive. No one can match me in lightning, from ancient times to now!" Lei Yun Huang spoke coldly, his eyes showing contempt. He didn't pay attention to Luo Tian.

Just as Lei Yun Huang ignored Luo Tian and focused on attacking Bu Tianshi, a wave appeared in Luo Tian's hands.

The void twisted. Under Wan Lingkong and others' eyes, the three-color lightning in Luo Tian's hands seemed to vanish. But above his palm was a massive wave.

Even more shocking was that the lightning surrounding Luo Tian and Bu Tianshi stopped attacking Bu Tianshi.

"What is this?" Lei Yun Huang's body suddenly paused. His eyes narrowed slightly.

When he saw the wave in Luo Tian's hands, Lei Yun Huang's face changed abruptly. His eyes showed disbelief.

It wasn't that the wave in Luo Tian's hands was particularly strong. For an Immortal King Peak, it could be a significant threat. But for Lei Yun Huang, it wasn't much more than cautious.

"Combined lightning. How did you do it?" Lei Yun Huang gasped. His greatest pride was lightning, confident as the top thunder emperor of all time. No one could surpass him.

He had once tried to combine lightning but failed, eventually giving up. Now, after billions of years, he saw someone achieve what he had never managed.

"Indeed, each generation has its talents!" Lei Yun Huang sighed. He watched the wave in Luo Tian's hands, then struck it toward the five-color lightning.

Boom boom boom boom...

Five explosions shook the world. The five-color lightning dragons shattered, turning into electricity that spread across eight directions. Moreover, the wave seemed to have absorbed the five-color lightning dragons, its power becoming even more terrifying as it rushed toward Lei Yun Huang.

Lei Yun Huang's eyebrows formed a river. His palm lightning's power was even more astonishing. What shocked Lei Yun Huang most was that something he had mastered - lightning itself - could threaten him.

Although the palm lightning Luo Tian had unleashed didn't look like lightning, Lei Yun Huang was certain it was. Accurately speaking, this kind of lightning he had never seen before.

"Let me see what power this lightning has!" Lei Yun Huang sneered. He was an emperor, a great being. How could he allow a boy to defeat him?

In an instant, Lei Yun Huang's palm surrounded with seven-color lightning. It entwined again, emitting a terrifying aura as it struck the wave that pierced through space.

The thunderous explosion shook the sky. Two destructive waves collided, and the entire world shattered. Even the world Lei Yun Huang had sealed trembled, with explosions echoing everywhere.

Ye Qiu and others' hearts were in their throats. They felt like they were in the end times. The attacks from Luo Tian and Lei Yun Huang could each destroy them multiple times.

The wind and clouds reversed, striking Lei Yun Huang's body. He was completely engulfed and disappeared from Luo Tian's group's sight.

"Did it kill him?" People wondered, watching the chaotic sky.

"It's safe to go out now!" But people cared more about the world sealed by Lei Yun Huang loosening. Ye Qiu and others shouted, gazing at the sky with excitement. They really didn't want to stay here any longer.

Taking the opportunity, Luo Tian and Wan Lingkong's group also left the battlefield. Bu Tianshi appeared beside Luo Tian.

"That guy is fine, we'll go now!" Bu Tianshi spoke to Luo Tian. This made Luo Tian's face grim.

"You take them out first. I need to check the World Heart!" Luo Tian replied, gazing toward the direction of the Seven Star Connection.

"Be careful!" Bu Tianshi gathered Yao Chen and others, disappearing from Luo Tian's sight. Luo Tian could clearly feel Bu Tianshi flying toward the domain beyond.

Others also moved, not wanting to stay here any longer. They flew into the sky, tearing through it and exiting this world.

The gray figure who had been seated all along finally stood up. His eyes showed a hint of smile, watching Ye Qiu and others leaving.

"It's time to reel in the net!" The youth spoke, raising his hand. A wave echoed from the sky.

As the youth acted, a series of angry roars sounded, as if something had happened. But soon after, there was no more noise.

The youth took a step forward, heading toward the battlefield where Luo Tian and Lei Yun Huang had fought. But at this moment, Luo Tian was already rushing toward the direction of the Seven Star Connection and hadn't noticed the youth's presence.

The chaos faded. A figure appeared - it was Lei Yun Huang, but now he wasn't as composed as before. His immortal skin had been damaged significantly, with many gray vapors escaping from the wounds.

"Unexpectedly, I was injured by a boy!" Lei Yun Huang sighed. Upon appearing, he saw the youth standing there.

"Disciple Bu Tianxin, I greet you, Elder Lei Yun Huang!" The youth spoke. But his eyes showed no respect at all.

"Hmm?" Lei Yun Huang's eyebrows slightly furrowed. He stood in the sky, looking down at the youth. He hadn't expected this youth to be fearless of him.

Chapter 2761: Struggle for the Nine Domains' Heart()

"I don't care about your heart. Boy, die!" Lei Yun Huang sneered, seeing Bu Tianxin's attitude. He immediately struck, raising his hand to send several bolts of lightning toward Bu Tianxin.

Bu Tianxin's eyebrows slightly furrowed. He still stood in place, raising a divine pattern that enveloped his head.

Boom boom...

Thunderous sounds exploded above Bu Tianxin. The violent waves struck Bu Tianxin's body, but he still stood there proudly. His robes fluttered as he gazed at Lei Yun Huang.

"Who are you?" Lei Yun Huang, seeing Bu Tianxin easily block his attack, had a slight change in expression. His eyebrows furrowed as he gazed at Bu Tianxin and didn't attack immediately.

"Does the elder wish to continue fighting?" Bu Tianxin smiled lightly, wiping blood from his lips.

"No fight. Tell me your purpose!" Lei Yun Huang thoughtfully gazed at Bu Tianxin, his eyes showing caution.

"Killing!" Bu Tianxin spoke two words lightly. His gaze looked toward the direction where Luo Tian had left, making Lei Yun Huang slightly startled.

"You're not his match!" Lei Yun Huang sneered, eyes showing contempt. Bu Tianxin's strength was good, but compared to Luo Tian, it was not even close.

"So I need the elder's help. The World Heart should be yours to claim, right? I can help you get the World Heart!" Bu Tianxin spoke. This made Lei Yun Huang's eyes show anger.

"Think you're his descendant, I won't kill you?" Lei Yun Huang roared. His voice shook the sky. Who was he? An ultimate emperor. Bu Tianxin's meaning - that he wasn't Luo Tian's match. How could he not be angry?

"Your strength needs no introduction, but don't forget where we are. This is a small world. And Luo Tian was once the strength of this small world!" Bu Tianxin continued, making Lei Yun Huang slightly startled.

"That doesn't matter!" Lei Yun Huang sneered and took a step forward toward the direction of the Seven Star Connection. His speed was extremely fast, disappearing from Bu Tianxin's sight.

Bu Tianxin didn't mind. He smiled and followed Lei Yun Huang toward the direction of the Seven Star Connection.

...Dong...

...Dong... Dong...

A heavy sound echoed through the world. Luo Tian walked through black mist, his eyes showing seriousness. He could feel the increasingly intense world energy, indicating he was getting closer to the World Heart.

Luo Tian quickened his pace. His Immortal King Peak strength allowed him to sweep through all, rushing toward the depths of the black earth.

Within less than a minute, Luo Tian stopped. Golden light flashed through the darkness, dazzlingly bright and appearing in Luo Tian's vision.

Luo Tian opened his Thunder Yang Eye. He saw a golden heart radiating gold light, constantly pulsing. Golden divine patterns spread from the surrounding of the golden heart.

"The World Heart!" Luo Tian didn't hesitate. He rushed toward the World Heart. That world energy had no resistance at all, making Luo Tian extremely happy.

"It's truly one of us!" Luo Tian reached the World Heart. Gentle light enveloped him, and his injuries were restored.

The golden heart emitted a friendly aura, approaching Luo Tian. He felt extremely comfortable and had no discomfort at all.

Buzz... Just as Luo Tian was immersed in it, the golden heart rushed into his body and landed on his heart.

At that moment, the nine domains' World Heart merged with Luo Tian's heart. The powerful world energy flowed through his meridians, spreading to every part of his body.

"Boy, hand over the World Heart!" Just as Luo Tian regained consciousness, a roar echoed. Lei Yun Huang appeared behind him and directly struck with his palm.

"Get lost..." Luo Tian's aura surged. He turned around and punched.

The punches collided. Luo Tian's body was thrown back, while Lei Yun Huang took two steps back. This made Lei Yun Huang show surprise. He stepped on the ground and rushed toward Luo Tian again.

"Old man, I won't play with you anymore!" Luo Tian didn't hesitate. He turned and ran. Although his strength had increased slightly, he was still no match for Lei Yun Huang.

Luo Tian felt a sense. The nine domains' World Heart was his great fortune. If he could fully refine it, his strength would have a qualitative leap.

"Boy, where are you running?" Lei Yun Huang roared. His body moved like lightning toward Luo Tian's direction.

Two people chased each other through this world. Luo Tian's face was grim. Lei Yun Huang's speed was too fast, giving him no time to escape. He didn't even have the chance to tear through space.

Boom boom boom...

The continuous explosions echoed. If Luo Tian slowed down even slightly, he would be hit by Lei Yun Huang's furious techniques. Luo Tian was completely enraged by Lei Yun Huang, and any contact would mean death or injury.

"I must get the World Heart!" Lei Yun Huang's heart roared. The World Heart was too important for him now. If he possessed the World Heart, Lei Yun Huang was confident that within a hundred years, he could completely reshape his body and reach the peak state. Therefore, Lei Yun Huang was determined to chase Luo Tian without giving him any chance to escape.

Luo Tian wasn't a fool. He moved like an eel through this world, searching for an opportunity to escape. If he could leave here and return to the Immortal World, Lei Yun Huang would have someone to deal with. The three peak masters of Huan Tianhai weren't just for show.

But Lei Yun Huang was no ordinary ancient strength. He gave Luo Tian no opportunity at all, leaving him with no path to the sky or ground.

"Time for the Demon Dissolution is almost up!" Luo Tian's heart was anxious. If this continued, he would become a piece of meat on the board, easily killed by anyone.

"Shen Suanzi!" Luo Tian ran while seeing a figure. Upon recognition, his heart was shadowed.

The person was Shen Suanzi, the one who had previously spoken with Lei Yun Huang. He had been following Luo Tian and Lei Yun Huang all along, but the two were too fast. Even with Shen Suanzi's speed, he couldn't keep up.

"Long time no see!" Shen Suanzi smiled lightly. He met Luo Tian and waved his hands, emitting gray divine patterns that formed a massive net, enveloping Luo Tian.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed. Facing this net, his body speed increased. He swung his broken sword and slashed at the net!

The sword's light flashed, slaying all. The overwhelming waves scattered. Although Luo Tian shattered Shen Suanzi's attack quickly, he still suffered some hindrance. Lei Yun Huang's attack followed immediately and struck Luo Tian's body.

Sss...

Luo Tian inhaled sharply. His whole body was numb, clearly feeling the astonishing power of the lightning that had struck him.

Luo Tian bit his tongue to stay alert. He didn't dare to be careless and rushed forward again, gazing coldly at Shen Suanzi.

"Once I have the chance, I'll kill you!" Luo Tian roared. But at this moment, he still needed to survive.

"You won't have that chance!" Shen Suanzi roared. He still blocked Luo Tian's path, raising his hand and sending a massive cauldron descending through the sky toward Luo Tian's direction.

"Shennong Cauldron!" Luo Tian's eyes slightly narrowed. He raised his broken sword again and collided with the cauldron, sending it flying.

The price Luo Tian paid was being struck by two more lightning bolts. Two wounds appeared on his head, directly connecting to his feet, causing him to fall from the sky.

"Damn it!" But Luo Tian's body flashed with golden light. In an instant, his injuries were restored. He stepped on the ground, creating a footprint and launching himself forward.

This time, Shen Suanzi didn't block Luo Tian. But Lei Yun Huang took this opportunity to appear before Luo Tian and struck with his fist.

Luo Tian couldn't escape. He had no choice but to fight again, unleashing six轮回 punches and a chaotic wind. A powerful world energy flowed through Luo Tian's arm meridians toward his fist.

Crack...

The great laws thundered. The lightning dispersed. Luo Tian and Lei Yun Huang both retreated simultaneously. Luo Tian spat blood, his whole body flying out over a thousand feet before stopping.

"It's a good opportunity!" Luo Tian's body emitted a crackling sound. Everywhere was cracked, but his eyes were bright.

"Palms of Lightning!"

Luo Tian raised his hand. A void wave flew from his hands toward the sky, and Shen Suanzi could only hear thunderous sounds.

In an instant, the palm of lightning exploded in the sky. A crater of ten thousand feet appeared above Luo Tian.

"I'll go first!" Luo Tian roared and rushed toward the black crater without hesitation.

Star domains appeared. Luo Tian's face showed joy. Now, if he returned to Huanhai, he would have escaped.

Luo Tian took out the scale given by Chu Jiuin and began to sense Huanhai's direction. As soon as he took out the scale, a strong repelling force acted on his body, making his face change.

"There's more!" Luo Tian shouted in alarm. He couldn't control it, and his body was pushed out of the star domain by a powerful force.

In an instant, Luo Tian had left the star domain and appeared under the void. His face was grim.

"What is this place?" Luo Tian held the scale in his hand, carefully sensing. But he didn't feel any waves.

"Done! I'm lost!" Luo Tian sighed bitterly, his heart anxious. He wanted to leave this place but the powerful pressure kept pushing him.

At the same time, Lei Yun Huang also appeared under the starry sky. He roared but was too late; Luo Tian had already been pushed into the void.

Moreover, Lei Yun Huang also felt that powerful pressure. His face slightly changed.

Originally, Lei Yun Huang could have resisted this pressure. But after being attacked by Luo Tian and others for so long, he wasn't in good shape either. And he didn't have a real body yet; he was relying on his skin and residual soul to survive until now.

In an instant, Lei Yun Huang was also pushed into the void and disappeared under the star domain.

"Everyone left?" Shen Suanzi's eyes showed a hint of smile. His eyebrows furrowed, and his fingers continuously calculated.

"Come out everyone!" Shen Suanzi spoke. A group of figures appeared around him.

Cloaked in black, eight people stood there with cold eyes. Alongside them were several figures, but their cultivation was sealed and bound. These people were the disciples of the Immortal and Hell realms.

"One escaped!" A black-cloaked old man spoke, addressing Shen Suanzi. This made Shen Suanzi's face dark.

"Ye Qiu?" Shen Suanzi looked at the disciples of Hell and Immortals, then spoke: "Did he find you?"

"No. He's also not light. It'll take years for him to recover!" The old man replied, his voice carrying apology.

"Good. Take them back first. I have some things to do!" Shen Suanzi spoke to the eight people, then took flight into the void.

"This is the last chance. I must kill him; otherwise, there'll never be another!" Shen Suanzi muttered to himself. His fingers continuously calculated and predicted, moving through the void.

"What is this place?" Luo Tian became more anxious. He had no sense of time, and he dared not to tear through space recklessly. But he felt his Demon Dissolution time was getting shorter. If he didn't make a decision soon, he would be more dangerous. After his Demon Dissolution, he would become ordinary again. This void current could kill him.

"Crack..." A crisp sound echoed from Luo Tian's body. His aura rapidly declined, making his face grim.

"Wherever it is, I must get out!" Luo Tian extended his hand and tore through space. He rushed out of the void, a sense of weakness filling his entire body.

"Is this Hell?" Luo Tian's eyes blurred. He fell from the sky, swaying toward the ground. He also knew where he had fallen and sighed longingly. At least, he hadn't landed in a place unknown to him.

Luo Tian fell from the sky and quickly found a city. He rushed toward it, scanning with his vast spiritual sense.

"I'll take over this inn!" Luo Tian waved his hand. A ghost crystal fell onto the counter, making the server stunned. When the server reacted, Luo Tian had already stepped up the stairs to the second floor.

"My, I've never seen such a big ghost crystal!" The entire inn was in an uproar. A group of people surrounded the counter, eyes filled with greed as they looked at the ghost crystal in the server's hand. They restrained their urge to grab it, because they all knew the inn's backer was the city's lord.

"Everyone, sorry. Our shop is closed!" The server quickly grabbed the ghost crystal and rushed to the back yard, saying loudly. This ghost crystal was too precious; it could buy this run-down inn.

"Master, there's something big!" The server rushed into the back yard and shouted at a man in his fifties lying there, sunbathing.

Chapter 2763: Tian Dog City()

Tian Dog City was a small city at the northernmost part of Hell. It wasn't big, just an insignificant force under the King of Ghosts. The city's strongest was its lord, at the peak of True Immortal Mid-Stage. In the vast Hell, such a force was countless.

In Tian Dog Inn of Tian Dog City, it was now empty and quiet.
