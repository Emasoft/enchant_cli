The disciples who could enter the Pill Hall's main gate without any guidance found it difficult to gain entry. Yet these young people could enter on their own, suggesting they held considerable status within the Five Elements Sect.

"Hmph! Luo Tian relies on his Five Elements Body and knows a little alchemy—how dare he treat us so rudely? I've already reported this to the elders. Go inform the Pill Hall's elders to discipline him harshly. And you! A mere outer sect disciple, why don't you kneel and apologize!" a young man's voice rang out.

"Master Ma, please calm down. I was at fault this time, but the three furnaces of medicine for these ten days have already been reserved!" Dong Sansi replied with a forced smile, his eyes betraying a look of委屈. This was not the first time; he had previously skillfully navigated such situations without offending anyone.

"Hmph! In the Five Elements Sect, my words may not carry much weight, but to you, they are imperial edicts! I command you to kneel and apologize—so you must!"

No one spoke, merely crossing their arms to watch the spectacle as Ma Yigao reprimanded Dong Sansi.

Dong Sansi's face turned pale, his body trembling. Though his cultivation was low—only Refining Body Stage Five—he knew people had treated him politely before because of Luo Tian. In truth, the inner sect disciples looked down on him; how much more so for these young people who were direct disciples of the mountain peak elders!

Dong Sansi knew he couldn't afford to offend them, but even the lowly had their pride. He stared fiercely at Ma Yigao, understanding this man's intent was aimed at Luo Tian. To insult him was to blacken Luo Tian's name. These young people were arrogant, always seeking to suppress anyone brighter than themselves.

"I won't kneel!" Dong Sansi's face darkened, squeezing out the words between his teeth.

Chapter Fifty-Seven: Pill Mandate

A clamor erupted in the square, people watching Dong Sansi with admiration. A mere outer sect disciple daring to defy an inner sect direct disciple—few could match his courage.

"What did you say?" Ma Yigao stared at Dong Sansi in disbelief, never expecting a lowly outer sect disciple to defy him.

"You heard me! I won't kneel. Are you deaf?" Luo Tian's calm voice echoed.

Hearing the voice, Dong Sansi was stunned, turning abruptly to see Luo Tian approaching from around the pond, expressionless.

Dong Sansi looked at Luo Tian with guilt, feeling he had embarrassed him. He was about to speak when he saw a flicker of approval in Luo Tian's gaze.

Meng Hao's arrival also drew everyone's attention, but no one recognized the young man.

"Hmph! Do you think having a pill master back you up means you can skip kneeling?" Ma Yigao's tone was cold.

Though Luo Tian's name was renowned, Ma Yigao didn't know his appearance. He had already ordered Dong Sansi to kneel, so he wouldn't let a random pill master interfere. After all, Ma Yigao knew most high-status pill masters.

"Luo Tian! Come here!" Luo Tian ignored Ma Yigao entirely, paying no heed to the glances around him. Whether they were direct disciples or prodigies, he dismissed them outright.

Dong Sansi hurried forward, but Ma Yigao snorted and reached for him: "I didn't let you go! You dare to leave?"

Luo Tian's previously calm gaze suddenly flashed with coldness, his eyes sweeping over Ma Yigao.

This glance was like a thunderclap, a lightning strike in the darkness.

After days of frenzied pill forging, Luo Tian's spiritual awareness had surpassed his peers. Ma Yigao was struck as if by lightning, his hand instinctively pausing. This pause allowed Dong Sansi to reach Luo Tian's side.

Luo Tian withdrew his gaze, turning with Dong Sansi to leave. At this stage, these so-called prodigies were worthless in his eyes.

No one noticed this moment except Ma Yigao; no one else perceived it. The crowd assumed Luo Tian's glance was merely sharp, paying little heed.

Yet, several young men seated in a pavilion far away had grim expressions, their gazes toward Luo Tian shifting.

"Such boldness! Even if you're a pill master, do you think you can walk through the Five Elements Sect unchallenged?" Ma Yigao's companions blocked Luo Tian's path, their eyes dark.

"You may leave, but Dong Sansi offended me. If he doesn't apologize, this matter isn't over!" Ma Yigao said solemnly, sensing the young man's identity.

Dong Sansi's face turned ashen, his expression bitter. He forced down his anger, watching the several Refining Body Stage Eight prodigies closing in. He knew Luo Tian was a prodigy and a direct disciple of the Pill Hall. Facing so many, Dong Sansi felt Luo Tian might struggle; he didn't want to let Luo Tian lose face. His steps halted.

"Who is this?" As Dong Sansi paused, Luo Tian's voice rang out.

"Goldlight Peak, Third Sect Master's direct disciple! Ma Yigao!" Dong Sansi whispered.

"From now on, I won't accept any of Ma Yigao's pills. Not just his, but those of these people too!" Luo Tian nodded calmly.

When Luo Tian spoke, the crowd's gazes sharpened. If they still couldn't guess who Luo Tian was, they weren't worthy of being direct disciples at Refining Body Stage Eight.

Yet some ignorant ones sneered: "Who do you think you are? As if we all beg for your pills. Just because you're a pill master, do you think you can act so arrogantly?"

"Because I am Luo Tian!" Luo Tian suddenly spoke, stunning the youth.

"Luo… Luo Tian!"

At the same time, the men surrounding Luo Tian turned pale, their gazes fixed on him. This recent sensation of a pill master—not just them, but everyone's eyes now turned to the calm Luo Tian standing there.

Ma Yigao's face shifted, others showing anxious expressions. They could scold Dong Sansi, but Luo Tian—deep down, they didn't want to offend.

After all, Luo Tian's name was too renowned: an unparalleled five-element talent, a prodigy in pill arts. These accolades shone upon him, making it clear Luo Tian would inevitably become the Pill Hall's pillar.

They hurried forward to explain, but Luo Tian had already turned and left, clearly uninterested in lingering. He had no desire to associate with these arrogant direct disciples.

"Ah, so you're Luo Tian. Even if you don't make my pills, I still doubt whether the entire Pill Hall has only one master!" Ma Yigao now found himself in a difficult position. He was not someone who easily yielded, but after biting his teeth, he spoke: "I'll regain some face."

Hearing Ma Yigao's words, Luo Tian halted mid-step, turning to coldly glance at him: "The Pill Hall has eight thousand inner sect disciples. I am but one, yet from now on, no disciple of yours will receive my pills—whether they are outer sect or not!"

Luo Tian's words fell, and the prodigies beside Ma Yigao instinctively distanced themselves. They didn't want to associate with Ma Yigao.

After all, Luo Tian was currently in high demand; his pills were hard to obtain. Though he only crafted third-grade pills, who knew what future achievements awaited?

"Of course, if I discover my pills are sold to you, the one who sells them won't receive my pills either!" Luo Tian continued, sealing Ma Yigao's last escape route and fully displaying his dominance.

"Also, you've offended me!" Luo Tian's voice rang again.

Luo Tian didn't care how others treated him, but he cared about those caught in the crossfire. Clearly, Ma Yigao aimed to use Dong Sansi as a warning—something Luo Tian would not allow. This anger surpassed even his own offense.

"Thus, within thirty years, no Pill Hall disciple will craft pills for you—not even an outer sect first-grade disciple!" Luo Tian's expression remained calm as he took a crystalline jade token, the symbol of a direct disciple of the Pill Hall. Without hesitation, he etched Ma Yigao's name onto it.

Chapter Fifty-Eight: Invitation from the Prodigies

Luo Tian held the Pill Hall's token, his gaze cold as he stared at Ma Yigao, as if doing something trivial.

"Prohibition of Pills"—this unique right of the Pill Hall within the Five Elements Sect established its masters' supreme status.

Luo Tian had actually used the "Prohibition of Pills" privilege! The crowd's eyes turned to his direct disciple token, a clamor rising. Murmurs echoed across the square as Luo Tian stood calmly.

Dong Sansi watched Luo Tian, whose expression was calm, and felt an urge to die for him. The "Prohibition of Pills" privilege—each inner sect disciple had two chances, direct disciples three. Yet Luo Tian used his only three chances for this one person.

At the same time, eight thousand inner sect pill masters took out their jade tokens, silently noting Ma Yigao's name.

Ma Yigao's face turned ashen, his breath quickened, body trembling. He recalled Luo Tian's words, despair flashing in his eyes. How could he have expected Luo Tian to use the long-dormant "Prohibition of Pills" privilege over a mere Dong Sansi?

"Luo Tian, I… " His voice faltered. He knew the cost of being prohibited from pills—just recently, the Earth-Soil Peak's disciples had been banned by Zhang Ziping. Now, Earth-Soil Peak was already withering.

If he had no pills for thirty years, how many would he fall behind his peers? This was tantamount to ending his cultivation. He could still try buying pills outside, but those were leagues behind the Pill Hall's quality.

At this moment, Ma Yigao deeply regretted his actions, but he knew even his master couldn't help. This was the霸道 (might) and uniqueness of the Pill Hall within the Five Elements Sect.

Ma Yigao saw himself become a solitary figure, no longer boasting. His face was iron-gray: "Luo Tian! I remember you!"

Luo Tian watched Ma Yigao leave with a iron-gray face, then turned to call Dong Sansi, about to head back.

"Ha! Brother Luo, I've long wanted to meet you. Today's encounter is fortunate—please grace me with your presence!" a cheerful voice rang out.

"I don't want to let you take the lead, Brother Luo! Your pill arts are renowned across the Five Elements Sect. Your body type is astonishing—could I also partake?"

"Brother Luo, my furnace isn't urgent. Just make it when you have time. Today's meeting—don't let you leave!" Three prodigies sitting in the pavilion laughed heartily, approaching Luo Tian with genuine expressions.

Seeing them lead, others also gathered around Luo Tian, faces carrying respect, inviting him.

Luo Tian saw their expressions and smiled slightly: "Your kindness is overwhelming; I can only comply respectfully!"

Luo Tian's words caused the surrounding crowd to display joy, exchanging fists before encircling Luo Tian like a moon surrounded by stars, heading toward the distance.

...

In the following days, Luo Tian did not stay in the Pill Hall constantly but visited various peaks occasionally. Gradually, he met more people, and his name became even more renowned in other peaks.

Of course, the Pill Hall's masters also visited often. Though there had been past conflicts with Lu Kunpeng, Luo Tian had now risen. His demeanor was humble, showing no airs of a direct disciple; most masters gradually accepted him.

Thus, Luo Tian slowly built his network within the Five Elements Sect.

Meanwhile, Ma Yigao's situation was bleak. Some who had once been friendly gradually distanced themselves. When he sought his master's help, he was shouted out. This made Ma Yigao begin to hate Luo Tian and the Pill Hall, but he was helpless—now he was truly alone.

Luo Tian's single "Prohibition of Pills" had also made people realize: pill masters must not be insulted. They understood the Pill Hall's unity and protectiveness.

The Pill Hall could quarrel among themselves, but if outsiders insulted it, all disciples must unite against the threat. Like Zhang Ziping had once banned Earth-Soil Peak's pills, all elders followed orders despite inner reluctance. This was the Pill Hall's iron law, hence its unique status in the Five Elements Sect.

Time passed slowly. One month later...

Luo Tian sat alone in a dilapidated courtyard, his hands sweating as he stared at the smooth stone beneath him. The sweat dripped onto the stone, sliding to the ground, forming a damp patch.

"Today, I will break through Refining Body Stage Seven!" Luo Tian suddenly opened his eyes, a glint of sharpness in them. He reached out, and a bottle of pills fell into his hand.

"如意炼体丹 (Ruyi Refining Body Pills)!" This was a batch of pills Luo Tian had recently crafted, meant for cultivators above Refining Body Stage Five.

Without hesitation, Luo Tian swallowed the pill. Seven-tenths of the herbal energy surged through his meridians. He didn't delay, immediately activating the Five Elements Transformation Technique.

An hour later, Luo Tian opened his eyes: "Not enough!" He took out three more pills and swallowed them.

Three Ruyi Refining Body Pills exploded upon entering his body, releasing a torrent of energy that rushed through his meridians. Prepared for this, Luo Tian fully activated the Five Elements Transformation Technique to refine it.

Five more hours passed; Luo Tian's eyes suddenly snapped open, seated on the stone, sweat soaking the ground beneath him. His internal energy surged, constantly冲击 (striking) his meridians.

"Now! Break through Refining Body Stage Seven!" Luo Tian gritted his teeth, roaring lowly.

A thunderous sound echoed from his body, a powerful pressure forming around him. The surrounding energy surged like a tsunami into his body. The stone beneath him couldn't withstand the pressure and shattered with a crash.

"Success!" Luo Tian's face showed a hint of joy, sensing the wild energy fluctuations within him. His eyes held confidence.

"Two months have passed; four remain until the half-year deadline. Even if I met Li Xiuping from Tianyuan City back then, I wouldn't fear him now!" Luo Tian muttered.

"Boom..." The heavy bell's sound echoed across the entire mountain peak of the Pill Hall.

At the same time, all Pill Hall disciples—inner or outer sect, direct disciples or not—whether they were forging pills or cultivating—dropped everything and rushed to the central square of the mountain peak.

Luo Tian naturally heard the bell's sound, a slight smile on his face: "Timing is perfect. The Pill Arts Competition has begun!"

Chapter Fifty-Nine: The Start of the Pill Arts Competition

The Five Elements Sect, as a dominant force in the Northern Region, held an unparalleled status. Yet within it, the Pill Hall's position was uniquely special. Five Elements Sect disciples would rather offend other peaks than the Pill Hall, for it fiercely protected its own. Like a beehive, it was tightly united.

At this moment, the mountain peak of the Pill Hall hosted eight thousand inner sect disciples and countless outer sect disciples. All rushed to the central square, for today was the grand event of the Pill Arts Competition held every three years.

The Pill Arts Competition was a grand event organized by the Pill Hall to inspire its disciples. All Pill Hall disciples could participate, including outer sect ones. If an outer sect disciple stood out, they might be taken in by inner sect elders—this made outer sect disciples eager for the event.

Of course, inner sect disciples could also join. Compared to outer sect ones, they were more desperate, as their starting point was naturally higher, giving them greater chances of earning elders' favor.

As for the direct disciples, they all aimed to compete with their peers, eager to show off before everyone in the Pill Hall. Their masters would be pleased, and so would they.

Luo Tian walked among the crowd. He was no longer the Luo Tian who had just entered the Pill Hall; his name now resonated as loudly within the Pill Hall as that of veteran disciples or renowned direct disciples.

Seeing the respectful gazes around him, Luo Tian sighed inwardly: "Indeed, no matter where one goes or what profession they choose, having strength earns respect."

Luo Tian smiled as he stepped onto the platform, standing beside the acting head of the Pill Hall, Zhang Ziping. Lei Yong and Ji Chen had already been there. Seeing Luo Tian arrive, Lei Yong laughed: "Little Brother! Your reputation has never been so grand. I've long wanted to break through late-stage Bone-Refining, so hurry and give me some pills. Those old bastards' fees are too high; I can't afford them!"

"Shameless!" Ji Chen coldly spoke, clearly disapproving of Lei Yong's habit of extorting pills from his little brother.

Ji Chen knew Lei Yong was likely the second richest among Zhang Ziping's three disciples, but he also knew Lei Yong was the most money-hungry among them. Ji Chen even felt Lei Yong's obsession with money was excessive, and this was what annoyed him most.

"Prepared for both of you already!" Luo Tian smiled, taking out two vials of seven-tenths herbal energy pills from his storage ring and handing them to Lei Yong and Ji Chen. As for Zhang Ziping, Luo Tian couldn't yet craft pills needed for the Yuanling Stage, so there was nothing to give.

"Ha! Thanks, little brother!" Lei Yong quickly took the vials, fearing Luo Tian would reclaim them. This made Ji Chen roll his eyes.

Ji Chen merely gave Luo Tian a grateful glance, and that single look between brothers was enough.

"Refining Body Stage Seven?" Zhang Ziping noticed Luo Tian's cultivation had advanced despite his pill forging, a hint of relief on his face. He feared Luo Tian would become like other Pill Hall masters who focused solely on pill forging and neglected cultivation.

"Yes, I broke through yesterday!" Luo Tian nodded slightly, knowing what Zhang Ziping was worried about.

But Luo Tian's interest in pill forging was merely for cultivation; he needed to become a master to endure his resource consumption. For example, the Ruyi Refining Body Pills he made yesterday—without collecting herbs himself and relying on a master to forge them, it would take two months to gather all and risk losing everything.

Zhang Ziping nodded: "After this Pill Arts Competition ends, come with me to cultivate for a while!"

Lei Yong and Ji Chen's eyes flickered. They knew Zhang Ziping was about to teach Luo Tian on behalf of their master.

Luo Tian's eyes also flickered; he had just realized he hadn't been guided by anyone of the Yuanling Stage, not even Bone-Refining. His cultivation so far had been self-taught with no techniques.

"Good!" Luo Tian felt he'd spent too much time on pill arts recently, sometimes forgetting to cultivate.

"Boom..." The bell's sound interrupted their conversation again.

Lu Kunpeng stood on the platform, seeing the dense crowd below: "Everyone, today is our Pill Hall's grand event—the three-yearly Pill Arts Competition! I hope everyone shines brightly and achieves good rankings. Naturally, the rewards are also there!"

"Rumors..." The disciples below stared at Lu Kunpeng with wild excitement. This was the top pill master of the Pill Hall.

"I'll now announce the rewards for this competition: first place receives a six-grade pill formula; second place gets to watch three elders, including myself, forge pills once; third place receives a five-grade pill formula. Of course, if you stand out and win the elders' favor, being taken in as a disciple is your own achievement!" Ignoring the murmurs below, Lu Kunpeng continued.

As soon as Lu Kunpeng's words ended, the crowd erupted in discussion. For those unfamiliar with pills, these rewards were meaningless; but for Pill Hall disciples, each was a deadly temptation.

"Alright, now please have the Pill Hall Head announce the start of the competition!" Lu Kunpeng looked at Zhang Ziping and spoke, then walked to the viewing platform, standing behind Zhang Ziping.

Zhang Ziping nodded at Lu Kunpeng and stepped onto the platform.

As soon as Lu Kunpeng sat down, he saw Luo Tian standing there. For some reason, his anger flared: "Kid, you've been making a lot of noise lately. Have you mastered the Thousand-Page Brushing Technique?"

Hearing Lu Kunpeng's words, several elders and their direct disciples also listened closely. Especially those direct disciples, who focused their gazes on Luo Tian.

They had all heard of the legendary "Thousand-Page Brushing Technique" from the former head, but none had seen it. Even the former head's shadow was unseen. Now hearing someone might have mastered it, they had no desire to miss the chance.

Luo Tian was about to nod when Zhang Ziping's voice echoed: "I declare the Pill Arts Competition... started!"

Interrupted by Zhang Ziping's voice, Luo Tian's expression turned mysterious: "When I forge pills, the elders will see. I don't know if what I've created is truly the Thousand-Page Brushing Technique!"

"You!" Seeing Luo Tian's clear mockery, Lu Kunpeng grew angry again, his beard flaring.

"Hmph! Kid, I remind you—don't forget our agreement!" Lu Kunpeng sneered, but thinking of Luo Tian's pills, he secretly guessed he had already lost half.

Luo Tian bowed to Lu Kunpeng and walked down the platform.

Chapter Sixty: Herbal Competition

The Pill Hall erupted in applause as Zhang Ziping announced the start of the Pill Arts Competition.

Luo Tian exchanged a nod with Lu Kunpeng, then walked up to the platform, drawing attention. For these days, Luo Tian's fame was immense! Even veteran pill masters regarded him as a formidable opponent, with no trace of contempt.

Seeing Luo Tian ascend the platform, Lin Zhengyang thought to himself: "I am a disciple of the Grand Elder, and I won't be overshadowed by you!"

Other elders' direct disciples also motivated themselves, determined not to be outdone. At this moment, everyone had set their sights on defeating Luo Tian.

"Hmph! Luo Tian, today I'll crush you beneath my feet to avenge the humiliation at the Herb Hall!" Qi Daolin's face showed determination, gazing at Luo Tian surrounded by eager eyes.

"Alas, little brother seems to have become the enemy of all!" Lei Yong observed the crowd's gazes, teasing: "Look at that Li... person. His gaze toward little brother has hostility!"

"Hmph!" Ji Chen's eyes flashed coldly, noting those who had hostility toward Luo Tian.

Lu Kunpeng also watched Luo Tian, his thoughts complex. He thought of the former head; now Luo Tian's situation was very similar to that of the former head.

Back then, when selecting the head of the Pill Hall, it was through a competition. Though the former head's cultivation was supreme, to make the proud pill masters accept him, he participated in the Pill Arts Competition. He crushed all other disciples, leaving them unable to lift their heads. At that time, Lu Kunpeng was merely an outer sect disciple.

Time had changed; now the former head's disciple also participated in the Pill Arts Competition, though it wasn't as significant as selecting a head. Still, most disciples regarded Luo Tian as the strongest opponent.

While Lu Kunpeng reminisced, eight thousand pill masters stood on a spacious platform, waiting for the elder to announce the first event.

"Cough! The first event of the Pill Arts Competition tests your understanding of herbs. A disciple who doesn't recognize basic herbs isn't worthy of being a pill master!" The elder announced the first event.

Luo Tian heard the topic and smiled inwardly—this was his specialty!

"What?" Lin Zhengyang's heart jolted, instinctively looking at Luo Tian. He knew the first event would surely be Luo Tian's dominance; he deeply understood Luo Tian's herb knowledge was no worse than Lu Kunpeng's, and perhaps even slightly better.

Other disciples who had witnessed Luo Tian and Lu Kunpeng reciting herbs also grimaced, knowing the first event was impossible to compete with.

"Hmph! I once worked at the Herb Hall, but he was just a disciple from a common city. Surely Luo Tian won't be better than me in this first event!" Qi Daolin sneered, eyeing Luo Tian.

Luo Tian smiled inwardly while scanning the crowd, spotting Qi Daolin's sneer and mockery. He sighed again: "He really is seeking trouble, wanting to compete with me on herb recognition?"

Lu Kunpeng, who already knew the topic, watched Luo Tian's calm expression and sneered: "Kid, do you think this question is so simple? I don't know your herb knowledge yet!"

The elder waved his hand, and a scroll floated into the air, unfolding itself.

Then, a screen formed by water-element spiritual energy appeared before everyone, displaying countless golden names.

"Next, you'll enter a special place where thousands of herbs will appear. For each herb identified, a number will grow behind your name on the screen. The more herbs you identify, the higher your rank. This will determine the rankings."

As people gazed in astonishment, the elder continued: "All participating disciples' jade tokens will emit white light. Luo Tian's token also glowed, and he felt a flash around him—this was an illusion. Though not as profound as the Questioning Heart Hall's illusion, it still amazed Luo Tian with its subtlety."

A old man emerged from this space, waving his hand. Countless herbs sprouted around Luo Tian, quickly surrounding him.

"Competition begins!" A voice echoed in Luo Tian's ears—this was the elder's voice. He sighed, beginning to identify herbs. Though he knew many herbs, most were unfamiliar; he had no choice but to examine each carefully, taking longer than others.

"Though I can't match Luo Tian in this event, I won't let anyone surpass me!" Lin Zhengyang looked at the herbs with confidence.

"Hmph! I've got first place in this round!" Qi Daolin muttered, looking at the screen's rankings and reciting herb names.

Other disciples also enthusiastically named herbs.

Time passed slowly. After three hours, some disciples emerged from the illusion, their expressions weary.

"Look! First place is Qi Daolin! Second is Lin Zhengyang! Third is Yang Zilin!" People marveled at the top three, especially Qi Daolin. Though he had some fame before, he was still behind direct disciples. When no one found Luo Tian's name in the top hundred, people felt disappointed.

"Alas... I didn't expect Luo Tian's fame to be so high, yet he only ranks mid-tier. After all, how long has he been in the Pill Hall? He's naturally not skilled at herb recognition!" People discussed.

"200,000!" Lin Zhengyang roared, ending the first round. He was disappointed; though Luo Tian and Lu Kunpeng had compiled nearly two million herbs, time was limited. Lin Zhengyang only remembered 200,000.

"Not bad for the Grand Elder's direct disciple; he can be called a prodigy!" People marveled.

Hearing this, Lin Zhengyang felt郁闷: "If I'm a prodigy, what is the one who knows 1.5 million herbs?"

"Hmph! 200,000!" Qi Daolin sneered at the screen's halted numbers.

"350,000!" Qi Daolin laughed as he broke free from the illusion. His name was clearly first.

"My god! He beat Lin Zhengyang by 150,000—this Qi Daolin, though he managed the Herb Hall, has far surpassed Lin Zhengyang!" People marveled at Qi Daolin's potential as a major underdog.

Qi Daolin now felt the admiration of everyone, his head slightly lightened. He looked at Lin Zhengyang with contempt.

Seeing Qi Daolin's gaze, Lin Zhengyang's eyes narrowed; he knew Qi Daolin was arrogant and looked down on him. He gritted his teeth, but had no solution. Yet he disliked Qi Daolin's expression.

Chapter Sixty-One: Lu Kunpeng's Calculations

At this moment, Qi Daolin was proudly watched by all the Pill Hall disciples. His gaze swept over each elder's direct disciple.

Each one lowered their heads in shame, not expecting such a gap between them and Qi Daolin. This made the Pill Hall's direct disciples feel their faces burn hot.

Lu Kunpeng watched Qi Daolin's overconfidence, his brows furrowed. He hadn't expected Qi Daolin to be so inflated. Though he liked Qi Daolin's dedication to pill arts, this overconfidence annoyed Lu Kunpeng.

Meanwhile, more disciples emerged from the illusion. Qi Daolin looked at those who hadn't surpassed 200,000 and felt even more confident. He thought he had already secured first place and had long forgotten Luo Tian.

In Qi Daolin's view, Luo Tian's talent in pill forging was outstanding but couldn't match his herb recognition. After all, no one saw Luo Tian in the top hundred.

"Hmph! I wish I could slap him for his arrogance!" One of the elders' direct disciples, who had once recorded herbs with Luo Tian, said discontentedly.

"Yes, but we really don't know as much as him! What's wrong with Luo Tian? Why did he only recognize five thousand?" Another direct disciple looked at Luo Tian, expecting him to shine.

He was one of the six who had witnessed Luo Tian's terrifying 1.5 million herbs before. He hoped Luo Tian would stand out, giving himself and other direct disciples some face.

As the young man spoke, Lin Zhengyang and others looked at Luo Tian in confusion. They didn't know why he only recognized five thousand, far less than a tenth of the total.

Luo Tian was also speechless in the illusion. Though he knew fewer herbs, careful observation allowed him to identify them. However, what annoyed Luo Tian was that the illusion's herbs were half from the Xianyuan Continent—higher than the Tianyuan Continent.

The Xianyuan Continent, Luo Tian had seen in his teacher's notes. It was said that after reaching the peak of cultivation, one could sense the thin spots in Tianyuan's space and break through to Xianyuan.

But no one had reached Xianyuan in nearly a thousand years. Why? No one knew.

Now, half of the herbs in the illusion were from Xianyuan—this made Luo Tian shocked. Fortunately, he had the "Chronicle of Epochs," and the "Hundred Chapters on Herbs" recorded Xianyuan herbs.

But he had to recall each one, slowing his pace. Though slow, the numbers grew steadily.

"Alas... Grand Elder, though I don't know how you knew so many Xianyuan herbs, it's still not enough to challenge me with the 'Hundred Chapters on Herbs'!" Luo Tian wasn't naive; he knew this was Lu Kunpeng's added difficulty. Otherwise, with his previous 1.5 million herbs, others wouldn't have a chance!

Luo Tian was patient, identifying each herb one by one. His numbers grew steadily, and his rank slowly climbed.

Lu Kunpeng sat on the viewing platform, smiling: "Kid, I don't believe you can identify herbs not from Tianyuan!"

Time passed slowly. All participants emerged from the illusion, and when people saw Qi Daolin's 350,000, their faces darkened.

Qi Daolin smiled proudly, watching Luo Tian still in the illusion. He thought Luo Tian had only recognized 80,000 now—far behind him. This was just a final struggle.

Lin Zhengyang's face grew more puzzled; he couldn't believe Luo Tian had recognized fewer herbs than himself. This was beyond his belief.

Time passed another hour; the platform had no one left except Luo Tian, whose numbers grew one by one like a snail.

People focused their gazes on Luo Tian, wondering what this rising genius was up to.
