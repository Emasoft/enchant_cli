The group laughed as they stepped through the golden gate, vanishing into the third-level hall. The entire palace fell back into silence.

"Ha ha! Old friend, it seems your descendants hold no respect for you at all!" A light laugh echoed. The old guardian who had previously guarded the three levels wore a faint smile on his face.

At that moment, Long Jie's youthful visage appeared within the hall. His gaze was deep and solemn. Though his face still bore a childlike innocence, his eyes revealed an ageless composure, as if he had become another person entirely.

"Want to refine me? You're not worthy!" Long Jie bowed respectfully toward the elder, then transformed into a dragon and soared through the golden gate.

"Things are getting more interesting. These people's quality is truly high!" The elder chuckled lightly before vanishing from the hall.

Chapter 985: Immortal Realm ( )

Within the ancient celestial palace, Luo Tian and others entered the fourth level only to be enveloped by a powerful teleportation force, vanishing at the entrance of the fourth level.

"Boom..." A heavy pressure instantly invaded Luo Tian's entire body, sending him crashing to the ground. His face darkened slightly.

"This..." Upon landing, Luo Tian immediately stood up and gazed around with a look of shock and awe.

His vision revealed not a hall but an entire immortal realm, perhaps even a whole continent. Mountains and rivers stretched before him.

The only thing that surprised Luo Tian was the absence of any human presence in this small world. Though there were living beings, none took humanoid forms. Above the sky, dragons soared and phoenixes cried out—each in their true form without transforming into humans.

Yet the fierce beasts radiated powerful auras, causing Luo Tian's heart to tremble. His gaze carried solemnity.

"Why am I trembling?" Luo Tian's eyes reflected deep contemplation before he examined his body. He was stunned.

In his perception, the ocean of saintly power within his dantian seemed sealed with no movement at all.

"Damn!" Luo Tian cursed aloud, immediately suspecting the "Sin" sealed by the fragment of the Epoch Book. He thought the seal had been broken.

But soon, he realized it wasn't the Epoch Book's seal that was lifted but rather this realm itself had sealed his cultivation, reducing him to an ordinary mortal. Even his physical body was weakened. Luo Tian sighed bitterly.

"What's going on?" Luo Tian muttered quietly, gazing at the凶兽 circling above. He cautiously stepped into a forest.

The forest appeared tranquil, yet instinctively Luo Tian felt danger. Not because of anything specific—just because he was now so weak that even a common beast could end his life.

"Memories... it's been a while since I felt this way!" Luo Tian could only sigh. Without his immense power, he had to tread carefully, recalling the time when he was expelled by Feiyun Sect and wandered alone into Dahan Forest. The same cautiousness.

"Good thing I'm not hungry yet. If I starve to death, that would be a real joke!" Luo Tian muttered quietly, thinking about becoming the first saint to die of starvation.

" I wonder how the others are doing. What is this place anyway?" Luo Tian shook his head, walking for a while before panting heavily and sweating through his clothes.

He reached a clear spring, swallowed hard, then leapt into the water. A refreshing sensation spread through his entire body. He drank greedily, feeling revitalized.

His eyes reflected satisfaction as he floated on the surface: "Comfortable... it's been a long time since I relaxed like this!"

Luo Tian sighed deeply. This period had been too tense, with continuous battles leaving him exhausted. Finally, this place felt like a sanctuary where he couldn't help but take a secret rest.

Closing his eyes, he enjoyed the gentle streams around him, letting them wash over him without caring where they took him. Since he didn't know where to go in this strange immortal realm, he decided to let his heart guide him.

After walking for a long time, Luo Tian felt drowsy and drifted off to sleep in the stream, his body unusually calm.

"Rippling... rippling..." As Luo Tian floated with the current, a sound echoed on the water's surface. A golden fish-shaped beast slowly emerged from beneath the river, its golden eyes locking onto Luo Tian on the surface. Yet it didn't attack him immediately, as if weighing whether he posed a threat.

Luo Tian floated aimlessly for what felt like ages. When he opened his eyes, the water had widened significantly—what was once a stream had become a vast river. He was stunned.

"Rippling... rippling..." The rushing current made Luo Tian's heart tighten. His speed had increased dramatically compared to before. Normally, he wouldn't fear this at all, but now he was merely someone slightly stronger than an ordinary person. Against nature's power, he could do nothing.

"Damn it!" Luo Tian cursed loudly. In the next moment, his eyes narrowed sharply—his entire body almost broke down in despair. He finally understood why the current was so fast.

The river appeared severed, with rushing waters constantly falling. The sound of water hitting stone sent shivers through Luo Tian's heart.

"God, I hope this is an illusion. Otherwise, with my current state, I really might die!" Luo Tian prayed, thinking desperately about how to escape.

Years of life-or-death situations had made Luo Tian composed. He looked around, but the riverbanks were impassable and stretched endlessly.

"Only one option left!" Luo Tian had no other ideas. He turned his body, moving his hands to swim toward one bank. But his body still drifted with the current towards the waterfall.

"Damn it, what river is this!" After struggling for nearly an hour, Luo Tian saw only a tall tree on one bank. To reach it would take at least half a day.

But Luo Tian's lips curled into a bitter smile. He had less than twenty feet left before plummeting from the waterfall.

Twenty feet—gone in an instant. The next moment, Luo Tian was swept down by a powerful current. Due to inertia, he flew into the air.

Still conscious, Luo Tian looked down with despair: "This is trying to kill me!"

Luo Tian had hoped the waterfall wasn't too high, but seeing its height made him instantly despair. A thousand feet—like a mountain peak.

The rushing river pounded against the stone, its sound echoing in Luo Tian's ears. His lips twitched.

He imagined himself hitting the surface, blood splattering everywhere—completely annihilated.

Just as Luo Tian was lost in thought, a sudden crisis made his spirit tense. His vision revealed a golden fish-shaped beast leaping up and rushing toward him.

Golden scales shimmered under the sunlight, displaying the beast's formidable defense. The golden fish was several times Luo Tian's size.

Its massive mouth opened, revealing rows of sharp golden teeth. Luo Tian had no doubt this fish wasn't a vegetarian; it could tear him apart in just a few bites.

"Meeting my end in the belly of a fish!" Luo Tian's face showed bitter laughter. He felt utterly defeated, watching the golden fish approach rapidly. Closing his eyes, he didn't think—now he couldn't even fly or use saintly power. He was powerless.

"Ha ha! Finally found you! You've run away so many times, but this time I'll see where you go!" Just as Luo Tian felt desperate, a long laugh made him open his eyes.

Hearing the laughter, the golden fish shivered slightly and abandoned Luo Tian. Its golden tail swung, and it rushed back into the rushing river.

"you can't escape this time!" The laughter continued. A golden thread suddenly wrapped around the golden fish, pulling it upward along with Luo Tian.

A strong pull sent both the golden fish and Luo Tian flying toward the riverbank.

"Ah..." Luo Tian sighed deeply, gazing at the rapidly flowing water. He silently thanked for saving his life.

"Boom..." Luo Tian fell onto the ground awkwardly, and at the same time, the golden fish landed beside him like a mountain of gold.

The golden fish rolled repeatedly, trying to break free from the thread and return to the river. A large amount of dust almost buried Luo Tian.

Luo Tian slowly stood up, gazing around. A fat figure appeared before him, smiling as he watched the golden fish.

The elder was tall and had a single beard under his chin, resembling a living Buddha. His robe was half-open, and he pulled the golden fish toward himself with one hand.

"Ah, I've been chasing you for so long. Finally caught you!" The elder seemed to ignore Luo Tian, taking a small knife and inserting it into the golden fish's tail. He skillfully scraped off its scales.

"Thank you, elder, for saving my life!" Luo Tian bowed slightly, his voice respectful. He thought the elder was another guardian like those in previous levels.

"年轻人, it's me who should thank you. I've wanted this golden fish for a long time but couldn't catch it. If not for you being the bait, he wouldn't have come out of the water!" The elder smiled, golden fish scales falling continuously.

"What trial is there in this level?" Luo Tian didn't waste words, directly asking the question since time was pressing.

"年轻人, it's not good to be hasty!" The elder spoke calmly, taking out a large cauldron. He pointed his finger, and the river rushed into it. He threw in medicinal herbs and materials.

"Plunk..." The elder tossed the golden fish into the cauldron without further explanation. He focused on lighting a fire beneath it.

"Old man, I just love this one! Although I don't need to eat, I can't control my mouth. My initial goal in cultivation was simply to eat many delicious things!" The elder saw the fire stabilize and looked at Luo Tian, continuing.

"So, young man, what is your goal in cultivation? Immortality? Strength? Dominate the nine realms?" The elder smiled, addressing Luo Tian.

Chapter 986: Never Forget Your Original Aspirations

In the forest that resembled an immortal realm, a black cauldron bubbled with steam. Fragrant aroma continuously emanated from it, making the elder constantly swallow saliva.

"What is your original aspiration?" The elder's words echoed in Luo Tian's ears, making his eyebrows slightly furrow. He had never really thought about why he cultivated.

"Think carefully, young man. You're too young. Your strength has risen so much due to talent, but your heart hasn't improved. Although your power is strong now, it doesn't match your inner strength!" The elder spoke, lifting the cauldron's lid and impatiently taking a sip. But it was too hot, so he spat it out immediately.

Luo Tian watched the elder, recalling his words while seeing the elder's appearance of spitting out the fish soup.

"Some things require patience. Like this fish soup, I really like it, but when I want to drink it, it's too hot. Blow a few times and let it cool down naturally, then you can drink it!" The elder gently blew several times, then drank it with a blissful expression.

Luo Tian was stunned, his eyes filled with contemplation. He fell into deep thought. Luo Tian was so intelligent that he naturally understood the elder's intention, his face showing respect as he bowed and clasped his hands.

"Go on. Calm your mind, think carefully about the path ahead. This level has no killing or battles; it's to improve your heart. The time in this world is different from outside. One year here equals one day outside, so relax and think. Others will do the same, but you'll never meet them unless you awaken your true heart and leave this place!"

"Of course, there's a precious treasure in this world. If you truly calm your mind and comprehend it, maybe the pseudo-Epoch Treasure of this level will fall into your hands."

After speaking, the elder waved his hand, making Luo Tian vanish from the spot and appear at the place where he had first entered the level.

Luo Tian looked around at the familiar scenery, his face showing admiration. He took a step forward but this time wasn't as hasty. With the elder's words, he didn't worry about time passing too quickly. He walked slowly, appreciating the beautiful scenery around him—towering ancient trees, birds singing, flowers blooming. He felt the miracle of nature.

"Why cultivate?" Luo Tian muttered quietly as he walked, his eyes gradually becoming迷茫 (bewildered).

"Initially, my goal in cultivation was to return to Feiyun Sect for revenge. Revenge required strength, so naturally I had to cultivate. Later, I wanted to bring back Qianxue and Gulei from the Yellower Sect..." Luo Tian walked aimlessly, recalling all he had experienced over the years.

"Battles!" Luo Tian summarized his experiences over the years—battles of all sizes, never ceasing.

"Now why do I cultivate? To rescue Yunting from the Divine Clan. To deal with the nine yells of the冥域 (Mingyu)? For the elusive immortality?" Luo Tian asked himself. These were just goals, but not his true heart. Fundamentally, cultivation was a means, not heartfelt. He had grown tired of fighting and killing; otherwise, according to his previous methods of exterminating enemies, none would have survived in the Demon Region.

"Never mind. It's rare to have such peace. Enjoying this scenery is also good. Rare peace!" Luo Tian didn't think about anything, his mind becoming empty. He walked through the mountains and rivers, appreciating every plant and tree along the way.

Three months passed in a blink. Luo Tian still walked, but his face no longer showed leisure; sometimes he wore an expression of confusion.

"Scenic beauty makes one linger. Cultivation is another path, a road to the peak. The scenery along the way are people and events encountered on the journey. Now, recalling them all is nostalgic!" After walking for over a year, Luo Tian finally completed the entire space.

At this moment, Luo Tian stood on top of a mountain peak. This was the highest mountain he had climbed. If his vision were good enough, he could see the entire world.

"High places are not cold! I want this scenery on the path of cultivation, to protect this beauty and those within it!" Luo Tian's white robe was as pure as snow. He stood on the mountain peak, his eyes glowing with brilliance, gradually gaining enlightenment.

He sat cross-legged on the mountain peak, closed his eyes, and entered a state of meditation like an old monk. A spiritual aura emanated from him, somewhat similar to the state of unity with heaven and man, but he remained conscious, feeling the places he had walked before.

At this moment, the others were also in the same situation. Each was immersed in their own small world, but the scenes differed. Luo Tian had been sealed into an ordinary person; others were treated differently.

Feng Jiutian sat cross-legged with a dark face, his aura fluctuating wildly. It seemed he was about to enter the early stage of a saint.

Zhou Wei's face showed madness. His hands sparkled with stars, and the heavens were lit up by countless celestial bodies. His eyes were blood-red, obviously pushing his divination techniques to the limit.

Sun Mengru's face was serene. She seemed to be in a dream, her lips even showing deep smiles while tears fell from her eyes.

The most peculiar was Xu Liyi, Diao Dezhu, and Chen Zhanbiao. Their personalities varied.

Chen Zhanbiao had drool flowing, even calling the elder "brother," as if they were old friends. They constantly ate in the forest.

Diao Dezhu wore a serious expression, standing on the mountain peak and sighing repeatedly. A sense of loneliness from high places emanated from him. Diao Dezhu was skilled in transformation, having once disguised as a guardian beast of the Divine Clan to deceive and eat. Now his skills had improved greatly, making anyone believe he was a world-renowned master.

Xu Liyi stood on the mountain peak, cursing loudly without restraint, even including heaven and earth in his curses.

Long Jie also entered this fourth-level realm. He looked at the scenery with a childish face, showing confusion. Then he seemed to return to childhood, his face revealing a mischievous expression. He looked at the dragons and phoenixes flying in the sky.

"Come down!" Long Jie shouted, his dragon aura shaking the mountains. The beasts in this small world all bowed to him, subdued by Long Jie's dragon aura.

"Do you know me?" Long Jie shouted again. The dragons and phoenixes that had been flying suddenly fell to the ground before Long Jie, their eyes showing respect as they shook their massive heads.

"Good!" Long Jie sat on a dragon's back and spoke to the beasts that had bowed.

"Destroy this entire world for me!" Long Jie shouted, commanding the beasts gathering around him.

"Roar..." The roar of beasts echoed. Each beast's eyes showed endless fervor. In their eyes, Long Jie was their king.

Beasts roared and charged like a storm of destruction. Mountains crumbled, trees were uprooted.

"Damn it! Why is it him? How did this ancestor come back!" At that moment, the elder who was eating and chatting with Chen Zhanbiao suddenly changed face. He vanished from Chen Zhanbiao's presence and appeared in Long Jie's world.

As soon as he entered, the elder's mouth twitched. The scenery that had once looked like a spiritual realm was now one-tenth destroyed. Beasts with massive bodies collided wildly.

"Ha ha!" Long Jie sat on a dragon, his face full of joy. He watched the broken ground and smashed mountains. Occasionally, he glowed with light, revealing precious gems in the shattered terrain, making him delighted. His childish face was full of excitement as he collected each gem into his storage ring.

"You again! Stop!" The elder's beard trembled with anger, watching Long Jie like a destroyer. Mountains were flattened, and he was trembling from the pain.

The elder's roar was almost a scream. The beasts that were still destroying stopped their movements, looking at the elder with confusion.

"Why are you here? You left this place before, how did you come back?" The elder's face showed shock as he looked at Long Jie.

"You've reincarnated!" Then the elder stared at Long Jie, examining him closely.

"Old man, do you know me?" Long Jie's childish face showed confusion. He thought about when he was caught by that old man in the third level and told him about Long Zhan Tian's story. Although it made Long Jie familiar, he still didn't want to admit it.

"Know? More than know!" The elder seemed to have gone mad, looking at Long Jie as if he wanted to eat him.

"You're still the same!" The elder looked at a gem in Long Jie's hand, his mouth twitching. He remembered Long Zhan Tian's misdeeds in this level.

Long Zhan Tian had done the same as Long Jie, turning over the entire space. The elder had finally come out and thrown him out of this small world, directly into the next level. This small world had never recovered.

The elder waved his hand without waiting for Long Jie to react, sending him out of the small world. He sighed deeply, secretly thinking he had finally sent this little ancestor away.

"Buzz..." The teleportation force was felt. Long Jie, confused, appeared in the hall with eighteen figures all shining brightly and looking at him. They all gasped.

Chapter 987: Cultivation of the Mind

On the mountain peak, Luo Tian sat cross-legged, his entire being immersed in silence. He seemed to merge with this small world.

"One year... two years..." Luo Tian sat in meditation day after day, year after year. He was like a statue. As he meditated longer, beasts gradually gathered around the mountain where he sat, their faces showing deep intoxication. They bowed around Luo Tian.

Ten years passed. Luo Tian's body was covered in dust, looking like he had achieved enlightenment. His entire being was silent. The beasts around him grew more and more, all entering a state of silence like statues.

On this day, the silent atmosphere suddenly burst forth. A powerful aura radiated from Luo Tian, spreading to the surrounding mountains and rivers.

The entire world fell silent. Trees stopped growing; rivers ceased flowing. The whole world was quiet, as if time had frozen.

This phenomenon lasted for three days. A heavy heartbeat echoed from Luo Tian's body, strong and powerful like a primordial warrior coming back to life.

With the heartbeat sound, the small world began to slowly revive. The beasts all opened their eyes, showing human-like respect.

"Rippling... rippling..." Waves echoed within Luo Tian's body. After ten years of silence, his dantian slowly rose, golden light spreading throughout the small world like a blazing sun.

Luo Tian slowly opened his eyes. He stood up, gazing into the distance. His eyes showed endless clarity. He clenched his fists: "The mind is complete!"

Then, Luo Tian's hands moved rapidly. Waves of energy radiated from his hands. The sound of waves echoed from his dantian, and golden saintly power slowly circulated. His hands continuously evolved their martial arts. Especially the "Fana Attack" was now more natural, having reached a complete level equivalent to five times the attack power of Gu Tian.

"Amazing! Five times the attack equals you fighting five of yourself. How terrifying! I can't imagine anyone at your level who could withstand your attack!" The elder's voice echoed, his face showing a smile.

"Thank you, elder!" Luo Tian showed respect on his face. His voice was calm and without ripples. In this year, his cultivation hadn't increased, but his strength had greatly improved, especially the completion of his mind.

"Good. Ten years to complete your mind and find your true self. Although it's a bit slower than others, it's still good!" The elder nodded, seeing Luo Tian's current state. He felt Luo Tian had become more composed than when he first met him, much stronger.

"Two years of walking the earth with a mortal body. Eight years to understand your heart. This will definitely benefit your future cultivation!" The elder spoke softly.

Luo Tian nodded, feeling the change in his mindset. Previously, he had some harshness. Now, he felt natural and complete, with a transformation in his mind.

"How about finding the Tianji Dao Map?" The elder spoke lightly, his voice carrying a smile.

Hearing the elder's words, Luo Tian's lips slightly curved. He gazed into the distance, whispering: "If I'm not mistaken, this small world must be one of the Tianji Dao Map's places. To find the Tianji Dao Map, you must break through this small world and exit from within it!"

Luo Tian spoke, his hands moving rapidly. A golden seal slowly formed. The powerful pressure made the surrounding beasts tremble, their eyes showing infinite fear. The completed "Fana Attack" poured into the seal, increasing its power to suppress a saint in the early stage.

The elder initially felt satisfied with Luo Tian's words but changed face when he saw the seal in Luo Tian's hands. He threw down his chicken leg and jumped up: "Damn it! Who told you to break this small world? Stop immediately!"

"Huh?" Luo Tian's eyebrows slightly furrowed, his eyes showing inquiry.

"Who told you to break this small world? God, how did your mind improve? Stop immediately!" The elder saw the seal had formed and felt a terrifying aura. Even he felt a shiver of fear. If it were thrown out, this small world would be destroyed or at least severely damaged.

Luo Tian's eyes showed a bitter expression. Seeing the elder's reaction, he realized his idea might have been wrong. But now that the seal had formed, if he forced it back, he would suffer a severe backlash. He knew the power of this seal with the "Fana Attack" added—its counterattack might be unbearable.

"Bad luck. Go away, you have no connection with the Tianji Dao Map! If I weren't in this map, I would have slapped you to death. And that dragon—each one is just a destroyer!" The elder waved his hand, teleportation force rising under Luo Tian's feet. He sent Luo Tian away with the seal from the mountain peak.

A flash of light, and Luo Tian appeared in a palace holding the seal. Several figures appeared before him. Upon seeing the seal in Luo Tian's hands, their faces changed, and they stepped back cautiously.

"Damn it, Luo Tian, what are you doing!" Diao Dezhu looked at the seal in Luo Tian's hands, his voice trembling.

Luo Tian furrowed his eyebrows, looking at Diao Dezhu. There were also Xu Liyi and others. Two from the Divine Clan appeared, as well as two from Xingluo Domain.

"I was expelled!" Luo Tian's face showed a bitter smile as he spoke to them.

"What do you mean, dragging around a seal?" Xu Liyi didn't understand what had happened to Luo Tian and asked.

"Let me explain later!" Luo Tian looked at the seal in his hands, gazing into the depths of the hall. He pushed the seal forward.

"Boom..." Thunder rolled, a fierce aura instantly invading people's minds. Their faces showed slight trembling.

The strong golden light struck the hall walls, making the entire hall tremble three times. It was like when the Epoch Bell was struck.

"Luo Tian seems to have become stronger again!" Xu Liyi spoke, his voice filled with admiration. The powerful fluctuation formed an invisible gust of wind that swept over everyone, causing their faces to feel pain.

"Cut it out. Don't say that as if you hadn't become stronger!" Xu Liyi smiled, looking at Diao Dezhu who had entered the early stage of a saint.

"That's right, I am who I am—the most noble ghostly ferret in history!" Diao Dezhu, upon mentioning his entry into the early stage of a saint, showed pride.

"Hmph. When Feng Jiutian comes out, I'll deal with him!" Diao Dezhu looked at the ancient Dao Map covering the entire hall.

Luo Tian sighed deeply, then smiled bitterly: "It seems I won't have the chance to obtain this Tianji Dao Map either!"

His gaze also looked at the ancient Dao Map in the hall: "Another pseudo-Epoch Treasure. This ancient celestial palace, who left it? Definitely a great sage!"

"Don't think about it, kid. This ancient celestial palace itself is a treasure!" A deep voice echoed. Luo Tian's mind flashed with golden light, and a deep voice appeared in the golden ocean. The old man wore a smile.

"It's you!" Luo Tian's eyes widened, then he calmed himself. His spiritual sense formed a golden little person in his mind, looking at the old man.

"Yes, it's me. I didn't expect you to have reached the early stage of a saint!" The old man stood there, appearing somewhat ethereal. His eyes showed satisfaction.

"Master, who are you exactly?" Luo Tian bowed respectfully. This old man's identity was definitely high, closely related to the nine yells of Mingyu.

"I am merely a fragment of a soul! If it weren't for the Epoch Book, I might have already disintegrated!" The old man's face showed a trace of nostalgia.

"My soul fragment has recovered some, but I still can't stay away from the Epoch Book for long. I can only appear in your mind's eye!" The old man smiled, speaking to Luo Tian.

"I appeared to tell you that this ancient celestial palace itself is a treasure. And across the nine realms, only a few treasures can match it!" The old man spoke slowly while Luo Tian listened carefully.

Hearing the old man's words, Luo Tian's breathing changed. Although his mind was complete, the old man's words still made him restless. He vaguely guessed what level this ancient celestial palace belonged to.

"Yes, as you suspected, this ancient celestial palace is a pseudo-Epoch Treasure!" The old man's words echoed in the mind, making Luo Tian restless.

A pseudo-Epoch Treasure is an object that many saintly clans fight over. If this news spread, it would cause a frenzy across the nine realms.

"People only know that this ancient celestial palace is a tomb for saints, the strongest trial path in history. Young talents have bled to death. But they don't know this palace was created by a Epoch Master to find disciples!" The old man sighed, his voice filled with emotion.

The old man's words were shocking, making Luo Tian unable to calm down. Though just a few sentences, they completely shook Luo Tian's spirit.

First, an Epoch Treasure, then an Epoch Master. Luo Tian had read ancient texts; an Epoch Master's power was beyond the heavens, even difficult to suppress by heaven. They were beings above the Epoch level. Each epoch only had one Epoch Master, absolute ruler of the nine realms. No one could challenge them. Each Epoch Master would forge an Epoch Treasure, which was incredibly powerful. If it could be activated, it could match the full power of an Epoch Master.

"This ancient celestial palace is what I forged as a treasure!" The old man spoke, his voice filled with bitterness. It almost made Luo Tian fall to the ground.

Chapter 988: Epoch Master

In his mind's eye, Luo Tian trembled. He looked at the old man who seemed kind and smiled, his face showing disbelief.

"Epoch... Epoch Master!" Luo Tian instinctively spoke. He couldn't imagine this thin old man without a physical body was once the top person in the nine realms.

"Yes, I am the previous epoch's Epoch Master! But now I'm not. You can say I'm a dead man. What you see now is just a fragment of my soul."

"Epoch Master, truly powerful! Even a single soul fragment could resist a saint at the peak!" Luo Tian marveled in his heart.

"This ancient celestial palace was what I wanted to select disciples and forge. Unexpectedly, it turned out nine ungrateful people. At my final moment, they attacked me to obtain the Epoch Master's mark!" The old man sighed, his eyes showing a trace of bitterness. Even an Epoch Master had been betrayed.

"Master, by all means, there should have been many Epoch Masters in previous epochs. Why hasn't any Epoch Master appeared now?" Luo Tian's face showed confusion, asking his question. This old man was definitely a living fossil with many secrets.

"The nine realms aren't as simple as you imagine. All major forces that have survived to today rely on their inheritance. Although I've been surviving in the Epoch Book, I know that what you've experienced is all true. What you see now are forces with long traditions, which were also prosperous in my epoch."

"Take the Divine Clan for example. The Divine Clan must have had an Epoch Master too. Although an Epoch Master doesn't live forever, one epoch can make a family flourish completely. An Epoch Master may be worn away by time but will leave behind an Epoch Treasure, its power terrifying and guarding sacred places. No force dares to provoke a sacred place with an Epoch Treasure. The inheritance of one epoch is truly astonishing!" The old man spoke slowly, having intended to create a sacred place for his inheritance.

Luo Tian's spirit was slightly startled. He hadn't realized he had underestimated the major sacred places and clans so much. He thought that if he reached half of the Epoch level, he could sweep through all sacred places and clans.

"The sky has changed. It's different from the previous epoch, as if sealed!" The old man pointed to the top of his head. Luo Tian understood—this referred to heaven's will.

"However, I can feel that a great era is coming again. These young people in this ancient celestial palace are all outstanding talents. In the previous epoch, they had great potential to become Epoch Masters and even reach the peak of an epoch. Perhaps this will be a turning point!" The old man's face showed admiration as he looked at Luo Tian.
