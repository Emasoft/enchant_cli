Luo Tian did not pay much attention to it. After all, these people were the prodigies of their time, treasured by their sects. How could they not have elixirs on them? He simply hoped the guardians of these trials would be stronger, so that their vital energy would be drained more.

Yet what surprised Luo Tian was that after such a long time, he hadn't seen Leng Qiuchan's figure. He sighed inwardly, wondering if this girl was so powerful that she had endured until now.

“Hum…” A fluctuation spread again, and Luo Tian's eyes were listless as he habitually extended his spiritual awareness.

But in the next moment, Luo Tian suddenly opened his eyes wide and vanished from his spot, appearing at the direction where a figure fell. His hands shot out, catching the black-cloaked person in his arms.

As soon as he felt someone catch him, the black-cloaked figure stiffened abruptly.

Luo Tian sensed a cold killing intent surrounding him. He let out a bitter smile and whispered, “Don’t be afraid. It’s me!”

The person Luo Tian had caught was indeed Leng Qiuchan. At the moment of falling, she felt herself held in his arms. A killing intent filled her heart—when had anyone ever caught her like this? Her mind had already condemned the person to death.

But when she heard Luo Tian’s familiar voice, her body stiffened slightly. She involuntarily recalled the ambiguous moment in the forest. Now it was this man again, holding her in his arms—but could she kill him? She knew now she couldn’t.

“Let go!” A cold voice rang out from Leng Qiuchan’s mouth, snapping Luo Tian out of his awkwardness. He quickly released her.

It wasn’t that Luo Tian truly wanted to take advantage of Leng Qiuchan; it was simply because she was a girl and had some familiarity with him. He felt it wasn’t good for her to fall into the pile of corpses, so he had caught her.

“Hmph!” Leng Qiuchan let out a cold snort and walked toward the only open space. When she saw the eye-catching white cloth, her lips twitched in a smile—but it was only a single sound before she returned to her icy demeanor.

Hearing Leng Qiuchan’s silver bell-like laughter, Luo Tian’s face showed shock. He hadn’t expected that since they met, Leng Qiuchan had never smiled, always maintaining an icy demeanor and tone. This was the first time he heard her laugh.

“What are you looking at?” Leng Qiuchan snapped.

“Nothing… your laugh sounds quite nice!” Luo Tian quickly replied, earning a cold gaze from Leng Qiuchan.

Luo Tian rubbed his nose in无奈, about to step forward when he noticed she had already closed her eyes and was restoring her vital energy.

Another fluctuation entered Luo Tian’s ears, and Ying Hongtu's figure appeared in his spiritual awareness. Luo Tian didn’t even bother to care.

“Pang…” Ying Hongtu’s face was grim as he fell, ignoring the blood on his body. He walked toward the open space with a dark expression, glancing at Luo Tian before sitting cross-legged to restore his vital energy.

But when he opened his storage bag with spiritual awareness, he found that none of the jars contained energy-replenishing elixirs. His face darkened. He opened his eyes and saw the bold, calligraphic characters: “Selling Elixirs!”

Chapter 217: Trading Begins

Chapter 217: Trading Begins

Ying Hongtu’s face was extremely grim. He hadn’t expected the guardians inside to be so formidable. He had entered four times but only reached the sixth level.

Although he had been expelled multiple times, Ying Hongtu’s gains were considerable—his speed had improved significantly, and his combat experience had grown. Moreover, the guardians seemed to know his weaknesses, making him clearly aware of where they lay.

But now he had no elixirs at all. Relying solely on his body, passing the third level would be extremely difficult.

He looked at the grotesque characters and walked toward Luo Tian with a dark expression, asking solemnly: “How much?”

“First-grade elixirs cost 100,000 vital energy stones; second-grade elixirs cost 200,000. It goes up from there,” Luo Tian said as Ying Hongtu approached, smiling as if they had no conflict before.

“You should just rob!” Ying Hongtu’s face was wild. 100,000 vital energy stones could buy a second-grade elixir outside, but Luo Tian’s price was absurdly high.

“Brother Ying, you’re mistaken. You should know how precious energy-replenishing elixirs are in this domain! The price is a bit high, but think about it—if you gain just a little more energy, you’ll have one more chance, getting closer to the final inheritance!” Luo Tian persuaded him, recalling his time as a servant in Feiyun Sect, helping the sect sell elixirs in the secular world.

“But this is too expensive!” Ying Hongtu muttered, needing at least second-grade elixirs to recover, and not just one—probably three.

“Honesty is the policy; no haggling!” Luo Tian said with a sneer.

At that moment, Leng Qiuchan had already recovered and wore a faint smile as she watched Luo Tian haggling with Ying Hongtu like a street vendor. She hadn’t expected Luo Tian to have such a cunning side.

“Give me three!” Leng Qiuchan’s cold voice rang out, and she waved her hand. Sixty thousand vital energy stones piled up like a mountain before Luo Tian.

Luo Tian turned around, seeing the faint brightness in Leng Qiuchan’s eyes and sighed inwardly. This girl was indeed clever, even offering him a “supporter.”

Luo Tian couldn’t let Leng Qiuchan’s goodwill go to waste. He waved his hand, placing four second-grade elixirs in a jade bottle and handing it to Leng Qiuchan with a smile. “First business, I’ll give you an extra one!”

Leng Qiuchan took the bottle and placed it in her storage bag. She let out a cold snort, casting a contemptuous glance at Ying Hongtu before ascending the stairs to the third level and vanishing from their sight.

“Did you see that, Brother Ying? You’re not worried at all, watching others enter and leaving the treasures to others?” Luo Tian coaxed.

Ying Hongtu’s heart boiled with anger, recalling Leng Qiuchan’s contemptuous glance. His fire of resentment flared instantly. Though she hadn’t said it outright, her eyes seemed to speak: “Poor bastard!”

This was unbearable for Ying Hongtu’s pride. He let out a roar: “Give me three!” and waved his hand, dropping sixty thousand vital energy stones onto the ground with a round luster.

Luo Tian saw the stones and took them without hesitation, tossing three elixirs into Ying Hongtu’s hands. “Brother Ying truly is a dragon among men! Good luck!”

After saying that, Luo Tian shouldered his Split Sky Spear and walked away because he had sensed fluctuations from within the space—another person was falling.

Ying Hongtu held the elixirs in his hand, his face dark. He had wanted Luo Tian to give him an extra one, but instead of that, Luo Tian had spoken a bunch of flattery and left.

He looked at the elixirs, nearly vomiting blood. His inner lament: “This damn thing is just the elixir you extorted from me before!”

Luo Tian ignored Ying Hongtu, who stood there郁闷 and about to vomit blood. He flew toward the fallen Zhuang Shengjie.

But Luo Tian was so excited after receiving sixty thousand vital energy stones that he forgot Zhuang Shengjie’s habit.

“Swoosh…” A wave of clear water fell from the sky, striking Luo Tian and Zhuang Shengjie with powerful impact.

“Cough… cough…” Luo Tian had just opened his mouth to speak when the water rushed into it.

Zhuang Shengjie had also noticed Luo Tian, but that damned blood—he didn’t want it to touch him at all. He wouldn’t even bother with Luo Tian.

After coughing up two mouthfuls of water, Luo Tian was drenched and sighed inwardly. This Zhuang Shengjie wasn’t pretending to be pure; he was truly pure.

But Luo Tian’s face didn’t show it. He held his Split Sky Spear and looked at Zhuang Shengjie with a “friendly” smile.

“Brother Zhuang, your energy is probably low. I have top-grade elixirs here. Would you like some? The price is fair, and there’s no haggling!” Luo Tian dried his body and the white cloth while speaking.

Zhuang Shengjie quickly arrived at the open space, and Luo Tian followed him like a leech, talking incessantly.

Zhuang Shengjie had few elixirs to begin with. Upon hearing Luo Tian’s incessant talking, his mind was at its limit. He waved his hand, dropping sixty thousand vital energy stones onto the ground and coldly said: “Don’t bother me!”

“Brother Zhuang is truly straightforward!” Luo Tian took the stones into his storage ring and handed the elixirs to Zhuang Shengjie, continuing to watch the second level’s roof with longing for the next victim.

Another round of falling occurred, but this time Luo Tian was disappointed again. These people still ignored the grotesque characters and restored their energy on their own.

Luo Tian inwardly regretted not having extorted more at the beginning, but he had gained a fixed customer—Ying Hongtu.

Another fluctuation spread. Pang Haoran and Tu Yu Zheng’s figures appeared in Luo Tian’s spiritual awareness. But upon sensing their dark expressions, Luo Tian felt a bit happy: “About time… I don’t believe your elixirs will last forever!”

With a hopeful gaze, the two walked toward Luo Tian with dark expressions and asked solemnly: “Elixirs—how much?”

Luo Tian heard their words and felt a secret joy, his face again showing that self-proclaimed friendly smile.

Seeing Luo Tian’s smile, Pang Haoran and Tu Yu Zheng felt a chill. They noticed the familiarity of his smile, as if they had seen it before.

Chapter 218: Intimidation

Chapter 218: Intimidation

“First-grade elixirs cost 200,000 vital energy stones each; second-grade elixirs cost 400,000. It goes up from there,” Luo Tian smiled and said to them.

“Earlier it was 100,000, now it’s 200,000!”

“Thief!” They coldly spoke and looked at Luo Tian.

200,000 vital energy stones were not a big number for them, but buying one first-grade elixir was clearly unacceptable.

“Alas… you don’t understand, my business is booming! Look at Brother Ying—he’s visited many times. My inventory isn’t so much anymore!” Luo Tian smiled and explained to them.

“Nonsense! There’s no such thing as many customers—only Brother Ying keeps buying, and others haven’t even paid attention to you!” Pang Haoran coldly spoke.

Ying Hongtu, hearing Luo Tian’s words, had a twitch on his lips. He had bought several rounds already, spending nearly five million vital energy stones—this amount took up two-thirds of his assets, making him painfully regretful. He had already defined Luo Tian as a vampire. Now hearing Luo Tian raise the price, his anger intensified.

“Business is business—buy and sell. If you two don’t want to buy, I’ll have to find others,” Luo Tian sighed and walked toward Zhuang Shengjie again.

Seeing Luo Tian approach, Zhuang Shengjie didn’t even think twice. He was thoroughly annoyed by Luo Tian and waved his hand like swatting a fly, dropping 1.2 million vital energy stones onto the ground with a dazzling light.

“Brother Zhuang is truly straightforward!” Luo Tian smiled and took the stones, placing the jade bottle before Zhuang Shengjie.

“Alas, these elixirs are getting fewer and fewer!” Luo Tian said while collecting the stones.

“Idiot!” Tu Yu Zheng and Pang Haoran gritted their teeth, eventually being forced to buy three. When they discovered that the elixirs Luo Tian gave them were exactly those they had previously taken out for him, their faces darkened further. They looked at Luo Tian with a hint of killing intent but ultimately held back, sitting cross-legged to restore their energy.

Ying Hongtu inwardly felt relieved that Luo Tian hadn’t raised the price earlier; otherwise, he might have been penniless now.

Luo Tian smiled broadly as he collected the stones and looked at the four people sitting cross-legged, calculating his income. He inhaled sharply.

“12 million vital energy stones!” Luo Tian looked at the mountain-like pile in his storage ring and sighed. No wonder it’s said that alchemists are a wealthy profession.

“13 million, 15 million…” More people fell from the third level continuously, and the pile of vital energy stones in Luo Tian’s storage ring kept rising. He marveled at how rich these sect disciples were.

“Enough! I have no more vital energy stones!” Ying Hongtu cried out repeatedly, the first to be drained by Luo Tian.

“Oh… you can use equivalent-value weapons and treasures instead,” Luo Tian said lightly to Ying Hongtu, who was raging.

“Dream on! These are all my hard-earned treasures! You dream, ah ah!” Ying Hongtu’s eyes turned red as he stared at Luo Tian, looking like he was ready to fight.

But when he saw Luo Tian’s darkened gaze and the hum of his Split Sky Spear, he instantly regained his senses. Tremblingly, he handed over a high-grade yellow-tier long sword to Luo Tian.

“Brother Ying truly is a role model for our kind!” Luo Tian’s face changed faster than flipping a page, immediately returning to his merchant demeanor.

“Luo Tian, you thief! I’ll fight you!” Tuoboye couldn’t control his anger. After several rounds, his vital energy stones had been drained by Luo Tian. To enter higher levels without replenishing elixirs, he would inevitably be expelled.

At this point, only Luo Tian had the energy-replenishing elixirs. Capturing Luo Tian would not only gain the elixirs but also the astonishing vital energy stones, breaking this deadlock. This made Tuoboye take a risky gamble.

Tuoboye held his long sword and fiercely slashed at Luo Tian, a massive blade’s aura appearing above him.

Luo Tian’s eyes turned cold. He knew he needed to intimidate these people; otherwise, if one attacked him and he let them go out of kindness, others would also attack. If surrounded, it would be quite tricky. Thinking this through, Luo Tian moved his hands.

“Five Elements Generation, Human King Seal!”

“Split Sky Spear Technique, Golden Snake Wild Dance!” Two martial arts techniques erupted and attacked Tuoboye fiercely.

Luo Tian’s two techniques were terrifying. Golden spear shadows blocked the incoming blade aura, while the seal struck Tuoboye’s body and knocked him to the ground like a dead dog.

These two techniques used Five Elements Generation, and Luo Tian had given it his all to achieve a one-hit kill. The intimidation he unleashed could harm even an alchemical body, making it impossible for Tuoboye to withstand.

Seeing Tuoboye lying like a dead dog, Luo Tian didn’t hesitate and kicked him to the side. He sighed: “Robbery is immoral. If you can’t afford it, don’t buy. Why? I didn’t force you to buy. Look at yourself now!”

This scene was caught by Pang Haoran, who had just appeared. Seeing Tuoboye’s pitiful state, Pang Haoran shivered involuntarily and showed intense fear. He knew he was stronger than Tuoboye, but to defeat him as effortlessly as Luo Tian had done, he couldn’t. He inwardly cursed: “What kind of monster is this?”

Seeing Pang Haoran’s figure, Luo Tian ignored the fallen Tuoboye and smiled as he approached Pang Haoran: “Brother Pang, how many this time? Want more?” He advised him to get more because if the elixirs became fewer, he might have to raise prices again.

Pang Haoran’s face changed several times as he looked at Luo Tian, his expression complex. He glanced at Tuoboye lying like a dead dog and finally squeezed out two words: “Thirty! Third-grade!”

Hearing Pang Haoran’s words, Luo Tian smiled. Thirty third-grade elixirs meant 18 million vital energy stones. His heart was excited, and he generously patted his storage ring, placing three jade bottles into Pang Haoran’s hands.

Pang Haoran checked the elixirs and found none missing. He bit his teeth, suppressing his pain, and took out a talisman from his storage bag.

At the moment the talisman appeared, Luo Tian’s eyes brightened. He clearly felt its uniqueness and waited for Pang Haoran to explain.

Chapter 219: The Fallen Genius

Chapter 219: The Fallen Genius

“This talisman is a fifth-grade one! Its name is ‘Eight Directions Mortal Water Talisman!’” Pang Haoran said with a dark face.

“Fifth-grade talisman!” Luo Tian was overjoyed. Talismongers were rarer than alchemists, and encountering a fifth-grade one was fortunate. Especially with Pang Haoran’s painful expression and the name he mentioned, Luo Tian knew this talisman was precious.

“This talisman was crafted by a master of my sect. Its power rivals that of an intermediate-grade martial art!” Pang Haoran gritted his teeth and forced out the words, filled with deep regret.

This was comparable to an intermediate-grade martial art! It had already matched his Five Elements Generation’s Golden Snake Wild Dance. Moreover, the greatest feature of a talisman was its instant activation—just a bit of spiritual awareness would trigger it.

Luo Tian was certain if this talisman were sold, it would fetch at least five million vital energy stones.

He grabbed the talisman and without hesitation placed it in his storage ring, wearing a smile that made people want to stomp him: “Brother Pang truly comes from a major sect. You’re much stronger than us small sects!”

Pang Haoran grabbed the elixirs and didn’t want to see Luo Tian anymore. He walked far away, kicked over a few corpses, and sat down to restore his energy.

Luo Tian didn’t pay much attention and waited for the next round of people to appear.

“An intermediate-grade long sword!”

“A rare medicinal herb, the Earth Root!”

One after another, countless treasures entered Luo Tian’s storage ring. Many geniuses gritted their teeth but, seeing the fallen Tuoboye, they all收回 their murderous glares and exchanged elixirs with Luo Tian.

“Enough! Truly enough!” Ying Hongtu’s face showed a grimace. He had spent almost everything but still hadn’t passed the seventh level. However, he was confident that with a few more attempts, he could pass it. But looking at his empty storage ring, only some extremely precious items remained—he didn’t have the courage to offer them for those worthless elixirs.

“Ah, Brother Ying, you should think carefully! You were just one step away! Don’t you want to try again?” Luo Tian softly advised.

“No!”

“This is a level-graded treasure, the Locking Spirit Tower!”

“Not even if it’s dead!”

No matter how Luo Tian persuaded, Ying Hongtu was as stubborn as a turtle with iron in its belly.

“Alright, then you can write an IOU!” Luo Tian said lightly.

“Dream on!” Ying Hongtu roared, his neck veins bulging.

Who was he? A prodigy of the Thunder Sect! To write an IOU—if it got out, how could he live?

“Then there’s nothing I can do!” Luo Tian sighed helplessly, his face showing a helpless expression.

“Ah, Brother Tu, you’re out! How many this time?”

“No more!”

“Brother Zhuang!”

“No more!”

Another round passed, and a group stood staring at each other. Without elixirs to restore their energy, even if they entered, it would be in vain.

Chen Changsheng and Chai Xiangming also appeared in the second-level hall, their faces showing a苦笑. It wasn’t that they had no elixirs; with Luo Tian’s supply, they weren’t lacking. But seeing these people eyeing Luo Tian with ill intent, they stayed behind out of concern.

It was strange that Leng Qiuchan and her three black-cloaked companions hadn’t appeared much. Even in the second level, Luo Tian had only seen them a few times.

“Luo Tian, hand over your elixirs; otherwise, don’t blame us for being unkind!” Pang Haoran’s face was wild as he looked at Luo Tian. At this point, they were also desperate. None of them wanted to fight with Luo Tian now, but they had almost succeeded and didn’t want to give up.

“Hmph! Want to steal? Look at your current state—your energy is less than three-tenths. Yet you still dare to eye Luo Tian!” Jing Bolan’s face showed a bit of contempt, looking at the group.

“Exactly! I want to see how you dare to be unkind!” Chai Xiangming shouldered his long sword and spoke lowly in mockery.

At this point, they were also fearless. Their inner energy was abundant; originally weak, they had now become the strongest few. Looking at Tu Yu Zheng and Pang Haoran’s group and the one who had been knocked out by Luo Tian, they felt admiration for Luo Tian from their hearts. At least they couldn’t achieve what Luo Tian had done.

Hearing their words, Pang Haoran’s group darkened in mood because they were facts. Not only were they currently low on energy, but even if they had full energy, attacking Luo Tian would cost them dearly. Let alone now.

Tu Yu Zheng was also anxious and didn’t know what to do, while thinking about why Leng Qiuchan and the three black-cloaked people hadn’t appeared yet.

“An IOU is just that—nothing to your life! I don’t understand you people, dying for face and suffering!” Chai Xiangming spoke lightly, his voice filled with strong contempt.

“Exactly! If you don’t want to buy, I didn’t ask for it. It’s shameful to pull your face and steal, but you don’t want to write an IOU. I don’t know how to say it!” Jing Bolan added.

Chen Changsheng and Feng Tianxiong nodded in agreement, looking at the six people like they were fools.

The six felt they had never been insulted so much in their lives, their faces turning red as they stood there.

“I’ll write it!” Tu Yu Zheng finally couldn’t withstand the temptation of the Locking Spirit Tower and the Zhen Tian Jian, squeezing out two words.

“Ah, Brother Tu, sorry, but the elixirs are going up again. But I guarantee you it’s worth it!” Luo Tian smiled lightly.

“Luo Tian, don’t push too far! As the saying goes, be kind to others so they can help you later. You never know if one day I’ll catch you!” Tu Yu Zheng, seeing Luo Tian raise the price again, forced his anger and roared.

“Brother Tu, don’t get angry! Don’t get angry!” Luo Tian lightly patted Tu Yu Zheng’s shoulder and placed an elixir in his hand.

“Let’s call it a meeting, I’ll give you one for free!” Luo Tian whispered.

“Hmph! I don’t believe your elixirs are that miraculous. If they’re truly as before, then even if I pay the price, you won’t get through today!” Tu Yu Zheng looked at Luo Tian with icy eyes.

Hmph, he took the elixir and put it in his mouth—a seemingly ordinary second-grade energy-replenishing elixir.

He sat cross-legged and began to restore his energy.

Everyone looked at Luo Tian with anger, not expecting him to repeatedly exploit them. They also watched Tu Yu Zheng curiously.

“Bring paper and ink!” Tu Yu Zheng suddenly opened his eyes, looking at Luo Tian with a slightly hurried breath.

Chapter 220: Competing for the Elixir

Chapter 220: Competing for the Elixir

“Huh?” Hearing Tu Yu Zheng’s words, the others furrowed their brows slightly.

Especially Pang Haoran, as a brother-in-arms, he knew Tu Yu Zheng’s character well. If Tu Yu Zheng was truly provoked, he would be a madman.

But now, after Tu Yu Zheng had already spoken his mind, Pang Haoran knew that Tu Yu Zheng always kept his promises. Yet now he was proactively offering to write an IOU.

“Don’t know, Brother Tu, how much do you want? First, let me say that my inventory isn’t so much—only over three hundred!” Luo Tian smiled lightly.

“I want them all!” Tu Yu Zheng’s eyes slightly tightened. As the head disciple of the Water Source Sect, he naturally knew the difference in Luo Tian’s elixirs. Compared to his sect’s elixirs, they were much stronger. One elixir had already restored his inner energy.

“Good, one elixir costs 100,000 vital energy stones. Brother Tu, think carefully!” Luo Tian took out paper and a brush, lightly waving it before Tu Yu Zheng.

“Don’t worry; after you leave, I won’t miss a single vital energy stone!” Tu Yu Zheng’s eyes slightly straightened and took the paper and brush from Luo Tian.

Hearing Luo Tian’s price, others’ eyes showed shock. This was too expensive—thirty elixirs would be thirty million vital energy stones! Among the group, although they were all sect prodigies, thirty million was still a shock.

But even more shocking was that Tu Yu Zheng had agreed without hesitation.

Tu Yu Zheng knew Luo Tian’s elixirs were expensive, but there were no other elixirs here. He had to buy them.

The rest taken back to the sect would surely cause a stir in the Water Source Sect. Old masters who loved alchemy would definitely be interested in studying them, so he could recoup a lot of capital. Then borrowing some more would be enough.

Of course, there was an even more important point: after buying all of them,庞昊然’s group would lose their elixir support and be effectively eliminated.

“Wait!” Others naturally noticed the subtlety and interrupted.

“I want a hundred!”

“I want seventy!”

They all spoke loudly. Although they didn’t know what the elixirs were good for, Tu Yu Zheng had dared to take them all. Tu Yu Zheng wasn’t a fool; he must have found a deal, so he was so willing.

As people shouted in surprise, Tu Yu Zheng quickly wrote an IOU on the paper and rushed it to Luo Tian.

“Sorry, everyone! You were too slow!”

Luo Tian said with a helpless expression.

Tu Yu Zheng’s face showed a triumphant look, looking at the others and quickly placing the jade bottles Luo Tian had taken out into his storage bag.

“Tu Yu Zheng, what do you mean!” Pang Haoran, if he didn’t understand Tu Yu Zheng’s intention, was a fool. In anger, he didn’t even call him “big brother,” directly calling his name.

“Nothing else, just that Luo Tian’s elixirs are too good! I was so excited I bought them all!” Tu Yu Zheng smiled triumphantly.

“Do you want to monopolize? Your appetite is quite big, but can you swallow thirty million vital energy stones?” Pang Haoran’s face darkened.

“That’s none of your business. You can also choose to buy from me, not expensive—two million per elixir! Haha!”

Tu Yu Zheng had never felt so good. He watched Pang Haoran’s face turn red.

“Two million, you’re even more greedy than Luo Tian!” Pang Haoran’s face was fierce, looking at Tu Yu Zheng. He had clearly heard Luo Tian say the elixirs were gone.

“Brother Luo, lend me your cloth for a while! Let me experience the feeling of selling elixirs. I’ve never done it before!” Tu Yu Zheng smiled at Luo Tian, now looking at him not so awkwardly.

Although he would never sell to Pang Haoran’s group, it was still good to play with them.

“Sorry, Brother Tu, I still need this cloth!” Luo Tian spoke to the smug Tu Yu Zheng.

“What? When did I say I had no elixirs! Brother Tu, you misunderstood me. I meant there aren’t many of this kind left, but I have others!” Luo Tian showed an innocent expression and looked at Tu Yu Zheng.

“Ha!” Laughter came from Pang Haoran and Gu Zhengye’s mouths, even Zhuang Shengjie, usually serious, let out a light laugh.

“Ah?” Tu Yu Zheng was stunned and speechless, his mouth open as he felt difficulty breathing.

“Luo Tian!” Tu Yu Zheng roared, his aura suddenly becoming sharp and pressing toward Luo Tian.

“Brother Tu, this really can’t be blamed on me; it’s your fault for not listening clearly!” Luo Tian didn’t care about Tu Yu Zheng’s violent aura and explained.

“Exactly! Your ears are bad, but you blame others!” Pang Haoran and Gu Zhengye spoke loudly.

“Boom…”

Tu Yu Zheng punched a wall, emitting an ear-splitting sound.

“Alright, everyone, the next elixirs are gone for real! The next ones are third-grade elixirs—three million each! Only fifty left!” Luo Tian said softly.

“I want them!” Tu Yu Zheng roared and stood in front of Luo Tian, his eyes blood-red.

“This time you can still get there first? I want them!” Pang Haoran followed up immediately.

“I want fifteen!”

“There’s me too!” Others spoke one after another.

Chen Changsheng and Chai Xiangming’s four people were quite curious about what Luo Tian’s elixirs were made of, daring to sell so high.

Even more curious was that they actually bought them and started arguing.

Seeing them argue, Chen Changsheng’s four people had a strange expression. They were all prodigies of their time, yet now they looked like commoners arguing face-red.

In the continuous arguments, they finally determined the distribution of the elixirs.

“Tu Yu Zheng ten, Pang Haoran twenty, and two others each ten.” After finalizing the deal, they had another round of fierce arguments. Pang Haoran’s group bought a hundred second-grade elixirs from Tu Yu Zheng, and they finally calmed down.

As for how they split the money, Luo Tian didn’t care anymore. He collected their IOUs and returned to his normal expression, sighing softly: “These people’s money is really easy to earn!”

“Luo Tian, you sold all the elixirs to them. Then how will you proceed with the Locking Spirit Tower?” Chen Changsheng asked.

Chapter 221: Continuing to Advance

Chapter 221: Continuing to Advance

Hearing Chen Changsheng’s words, Tu Yu Zheng and others’ faces showed a smile. They had bought Luo Tian’s elixirs to prevent him from advancing in the Locking Spirit Tower.

Tu Yu Zheng and Pang Haoran had to admit they were mistaken. At first, everyone was deceived by Luo Tian’s cultivation of Body Transcendence Eight, thinking he was just a boy with that level. They had never looked at him seriously.

But after their performance in the first and second levels, Luo Tian was much stronger than them. The most shocking thing was that Luo Tian had defeated Tu Yu Zheng with two martial arts techniques, making them take him more seriously.

This was why they had lowered their pride and written IOUs to buy Luo Tian’s elixirs—to prevent him from competing with them for the Locking Spirit Tower.

At this point, they had succeeded in buying all of Luo Tian’s elixirs and looked at him with a triumphant expression.

“Deserved! A money-hungry thing!” Ying Hongtu fell from the third level and saw them just finish fighting over Luo Tian’s elixirs. He felt relieved, thinking he was lucky to have written an IOU earlier and bought more, otherwise he wouldn’t even get a drop.

At the same time, Ying Hongtu was happy that Luo Tian had no elixirs to compete for the Locking Spirit Tower.

Seeing everyone looking at him, Luo Tian slowly collected his white cloth and sighed: “Alas, yes. Third-grade elixirs are really gone.”

Seeing Luo Tian’s slight helplessness, everyone felt happy. Chen Changsheng and others’ faces showed a hint of regret—they couldn’t believe Luo Tian could produce fourth-grade elixirs.

“But I still have fourth-grade elixirs!” Luo Tian’s words made Tu Yu Zheng and Pang Haoran drop their jaws.

“Damn, don’t play like this!” They all lamented inwardly.

Tu Yu Zheng and others had bought Luo Tian’s elixirs, making them write huge IOUs. Returning to their sects, they didn’t know how to explain it. Now it was even worse—they hadn’t achieved their goal but were still being played by him.

“Hmph! Even if you have fourth-grade elixirs, how many can you get? Fourth-grade elixirs aren’t that easy to obtain!” They all sneered inwardly.

But Luo Tian’s next action made Tu Yu Zheng and others spit blood.

Luo Tian waved his hand, and dozens of jade bottles fell before Chen Changsheng’s four people, emitting a strong fresh scent.

“I have the most fourth-grade elixirs, not second or third!” Luo Tian said softly, a playful look in his eyes as he glanced at everyone.

“Uh…” Everyone was stunned. Although they had seen fourth-grade elixirs, even fifth-grade ones, they had never seen so many fourth-grade elixirs piled up there.

Chen Changsheng and Chai Xiangming’s four people were also stunned, looking at the dozens of jade bottles neatly arranged there. They couldn’t speak for a moment.

“Take these elixirs, enough for you!” Luo Tian’s voice entered Chen Changsheng’s ears, making the four people tremble slightly.

They looked at Luo Tian with disbelief, not expecting him to be so generous and give them so many fourth-grade elixirs.
