“Breakthrough to seven thousand zhang!” someone in the crowd murmured, their voice tinged with exhilaration.

Within the stone tablet, Luo Tian’s face remained calm as he swung punch after punch. Each strike caused a vast expanse of vitality to dissipate, while the stone tablet outside expanded by an inch with every impact.

“Seven thousand five hundred zhang… eight thousand zhang…”

Eight thousand zhang—this person had already surpassed Zheng Xin, the third son of Jifeng Valley’s record. The crowd gasped in astonishment.

Yet before their murmurs could subside, the stone tablet within the Cultivation Space had surged to eight thousand seven hundred zhang, surpassing Duan Xingchen’s height and continuing to rise.

Duan Xingchen’s face was the epitome of displeasure. His own mocking words about Luo Tian had barely passed an hour ago, and now the very “waste” he had ridiculed had shattered his record—this was a blatant humiliation.

Duan Xingchen’s eyes flickered with a murderous intent; Luo Tian had become utterly detestable to him. Especially when he saw Leng Qiuchan’s fervent gaze, which ignited a surge of jealousy within him.

Gu Qianxue’s face radiated brilliance, her lips curving into a perfect arc.

“Ugh… Ah… Ah…” Zheng Xin’s mouth emitted continuous sounds, his face etched with shock as he gazed at Luo Tian within the Cultivation Space.

Within the Cultivation Space, thunderous roars echoed. Outside, people held their breath, staring at the stone tablet that surged with deathly qi.

“Breakthrough to nine thousand! If he can surpass nine thousand one hundred zhang, this Luo Lei will surely become the most dazzling figure in the second trial!” The crowd roared. At this moment, no one could look down on this mere cultivator of the Ninth Body-Refining Stage.

“But with such insight, this boy will surely become a formidable power in the region,” Zheng Hongsheng murmured softly.

“That’s still uncertain,” Leng Hongcai smiled, his gaze deep as he looked at Luo Tian.

Duan Chenfeng’s face was grim; previously, due to the matter of Ninxin, he had appeared unkind in Luo Tian’s eyes. His son Duan Xingchen had also clashed with Luo Tian significantly in the first trial.

“Nine thousand one hundred zhang!” People’s breaths quickened, their faces alight with anticipation.

“Huh…” Under the expectant gazes, the stone tablet within the space gradually broke through to nine thousand one hundred zhang. Yet it did not stop, continuing to surge toward greater heights with unstoppable momentum.

“This is beyond belief! Nine thousand one hundred zhang—equalling the height of Yuling Sect’s first ancestor!” The crowd marveled.

“Leng Xiong, I cannot let you have this face! This boy is mine!” Zheng Hongsheng’s breath was labored, his expression awestruck. He knew well the significance of surpassing the first ancestor’s height.

“Try to befriend this Luo Lei,” Duan Chenfeng’s face was grim as he addressed his son.

“Hmph?” Duan Xingchen, upon hearing his father’s mental transmission, darkened further. He ignored Duan Chenfeng’s words and glared at Luo Tian with icy eyes.

“Did you see? This is the ‘waste’ you spoke of! If this one is a waste, then what are you?” Leng Qiuchan’s gaze burned as she stared at Luo Tian within the space.

“I wonder how astonishing the martial arts he created truly are… Perhaps even reaching the Heavenly grade!” Gu Lei’s face bore hope as he murmured.

Luo Tian could not hear or see the commotion outside; he had entered a strange state, his eyes half-closed as he struck the stone tablet without end.

“Nine thousand five hundred zhang… nine thousand seven hundred zhang!”

When the stone tablet reached nine thousand seven hundred zhang, it abruptly halted, its speed slowing.

At this moment, the crowd’s eyes were fixed on the stone tablet within the space, their breaths heavy. No one spoke; Wind Thunder Platform was filled with heavy breathing.

Nine thousand seven hundred zhang—heights no one had ever reached. Now it stood before them, stirring excitement.

Luo Tian continued to strike without end, the stone tablet seemingly permeated by deathly qi. Suddenly, Luo Tian’s eyes snapped open, and he launched a punch.

After the strike, no vitality remained in the space, yet Luo Tian’s body was brimming with life.

A hum resonated; Luo Tian abruptly returned to his physical form, and the Luo Tian within the Cultivation Space opened his eyes like lightning. His lips curled slightly as he gazed at the stone tablet rising high above.

“Nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine zhang!” A disciple of the Soul-Realm stage on Wind Thunder Platform nearly trembled as he announced the height.

“Nine is the ultimate; this boy’s insight has reached its peak!” Zheng Hongsheng’s face was awestruck.

“Nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine zhang—never have I heard of anyone reaching such a height!” Duan Chenfeng’s face bore regret, regretting his earlier insistence on Ninxin and his harsh attitude.

“Nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine zhang?” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly as he gazed at the stone tablet, which seemed to bridge heaven and earth. He slowly withdrew his hands from its surface.

“Huh…” A hum resonated; Luo Tian’s figure finally vanished from the Cultivation Space, reappearing within everyone’s sight.

As Luo Tian’s figure appeared, the heads of the three sects seized him and lifted him onto the platform.

Luo Tian was still dazed; before his feet touched ground, a massive hand of spiritual energy had already grabbed him.

As he steadied himself, his gaze swept the crowd. Dozens of Soul-Realm sect leaders looked at him with reverence.

Several young men gazed at him, their faces showing admiration. Yet Luo Tian was surprised to spot Gu Qianxue and Gu Lei among the crowd.

“Shangguan Fei!” Luo Tian’s eyes flashed with madness as he glared at Shangguan Fei, who observed him.

“Kill intent!” Shangguan Fei’s heart tightened; he was puzzled by the young man’s hostility. This gaze felt familiar, as if he had seen it before.

The kill intent vanished; Luo Tian finally turned his gaze back to the three sect leaders, bowing slightly.

“Boy, would you like to join my Jifeng Valley?” Zheng Hongsheng’s face showed a smile as he beckoned Luo Tian.

“I can’t hold back; I wonder if the three sects will tear each other apart over this Luo Lei!” someone murmured.

“It’s not that bad, though this Luo Lei is quite astonishing,” the crowd debated.

Chapter 363: No Longer Enduring

Duan Chenfeng’s face was grim; he too wished to invite Luo Tian, but his pride and the previous discord prevented him from speaking. He stood there, hesitating.

“I open my Yuling Sect’s gates for you. If you join me, I promise to wed my daughter to you!” Leng Hongcai smiled.

“Huh?” Not only the surrounding people, but all faces were stunned, as if they hadn’t heard clearly.

“Father!” Leng Qiuchan’s face flushed with embarrassment under her black veil.

“This Leng Hongcai is really pushing it!” Zheng Hongsheng’s lips twitched as he watched Leng Hongcai. He had never expected this tactic to lure Luo Tian.

Luo Tian’s head throbbed; he hadn’t anticipated Leng Hongcai offering such a condition. Cold sweat trickled down his face.

A bone-chilling aura rose from people’s hearts, and the world’s temperature plummeted to its peak.

Gu Qianxue gazed at Leng Hongcai and Luo Tian with a deep gaze. Her sword qi surged, now adding two more blades to the previous one. Three swords circled her body.

Everyone trembled at the sight of Gu Qianxue; Shangguan Fei took a step back, his body covered in ice shards as he stared at her with fear.

The three sect leaders also bore expressions of terror; Gu Qianxue now resembled a fairy from the heavens, her robes swirling as three swords radiated terrifying sword intent.

Zheng Hongsheng felt fear; he could sense that he could withstand one blade, but two at once would be impossible.

“You all continue!” Gu Qianxue’s voice was cold as she glanced at Luo Tian. The three swords surged with an impending explosion.

“Ugh…” Luo Tian sighed inwardly; this auntie was definitely furious. If he didn’t satisfy her, today would be no good for him.

Yet as he gazed at the three swords, a feeling stirred within him—these blades would not harm him. He didn’t understand why others feared them so greatly, even a Soul-Realm peak warrior like Shangguan Fei was trembling.

“What…?” Luo Tian’s cold sweat dripped as he didn’t know how to respond. If he refused, it would certainly offend Yuling Sect; after all, they had publicly offered their daughter.

This situation was manageable for an ordinary person, but this was the head of Yuling Sect. He represented the sect itself.

Luo Tian longed to shout, “I won’t marry her! I’ll still join your sect! Why are you pushing your daughter away? Although Leng Qiuchan is undeniably beautiful, do you know my other ancestor is nearby?”

All eyes were fixed on Luo Tian as he awaited his response.

“I oppose!” A cold voice rang out; Duan Xingchen’s face was dark as he glared at Luo Tian, his Starry Sword in hand.

His long hair fluttered; Duan Xingchen had never expected Leng Hongcai to offer his daughter to another. He believed he and Leng Qiuchan were already a certainty, but now an unexpected Luo Tian had appeared. His resentment toward Luo Tian erupted completely.

“Dare you fight?” Duan Xingchen spoke coldly; he needed to battle Luo Tian to prove his superiority. Only by crushing Luo Tian could he regain Leng Hongcai’s favor and retract his earlier words.

Hearing Duan Xingchen’s words, the crowd watched with rapt attention, thinking, “The show is about to begin!”

“You’re a man—don’t run away!” Duan Xingchen’s face twisted with ferocity as he spoke, ignoring his father’s grim expression.

Hearing Duan Xingchen’s words, Luo Tian’s face bore battle intent; since his initiation into the sect, Duan Xingchen had constantly harassed him. Now, Luo Tian had reached his limit. He let out a cold laugh: “Fine!”

“Huh…” The crowd was stunned, their faces filled with awe. They hadn’t expected Luo Tian to dare challenge Duan Xingchen with his Body-Refining Ninth Stage.

“Nonsense!” Duan Chenfeng’s face was at its worst as he tried to stop them.

“Duan Xiong, don’t be angry; youth is impetuous. A mutual exchange would be good. I also wish to see what martial arts this boy has created!” Zheng Hongsheng smiled at Duan Chenfeng.

Hearing Zheng Hongsheng’s words, Duan Chenfeng’s face darkened; among the three sects, Jifeng Valley was always the strongest. Zheng Hongsheng’s words clearly indicated this matter had been decided.

“Fine,” Duan Chenfeng gritted his teeth; he also wished to see what astonishing martial arts could reach nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine zhang.

Hearing the two men’s conversation, others smiled broadly, clearing a vast space for them to fight.

Gu Qianxue retracted her sword qi, gazing coldly at Luo Tian and Duan Xingchen. No one knew what she was thinking.

“Expose yourself then!” Luo Tian’s face bore coldness as he gazed at Duan Xingchen, whose eyes held murder.

Though Luo Tian was unafraid of Duan Xingchen, defeating him with his Body-Refining Ninth Stage was impossible. After all, Duan Xingchen was renowned in Kunlun Mountain.

Luo Tian had accepted much; entering this mountain, he had endured too much. This was not his usual style—his life was too precious. Sometimes, certain things were more important than life: the heart of invincibility.

“Huh…” A spiritual energy fluctuation spread; the Breaking Sky Spear, gleaming with cold light, was in Luo Tian’s grasp.

Holding the spear, a sense of sorrow emanated from it, making Luo Tian smile gently.

“Alright, you’re out now!” Luo Tian lightly caressed the spear’s body as if comforting a child.

Though Ninxin was powerful, Luo Tian preferred the Breaking Sky Spear; it had accompanied him for over two years, and that bond of blood was unmatched by any weapon.

“Just with this broken spear, do you think you can face me?”

“Starry Sword!” Duan Xingchen’s face bore mockery as his Starry Sword materialized in hand.

“Just these? Open it—Nirvana Dragon Seal!” Luo Tian sneered, his Dragon Emperor’s Reverse Scales clutched in hand. He slammed it onto his wrist; a roar of true dragons echoed, and the Dragon Baby’s figure appeared. Luo Tian quickly grabbed his Nailing Bag to store the Dragon Baby.

“Nailing Bag! Leng Xiong, I never expected you to know this boy!” Zheng Hongsheng looked at Leng Hongcai with bewilderment.

Chapter 364: Battle Against Duan Xingchen

Seeing Luo Tian pull out the Nailing Bag, everyone’s faces showed realization.

The Nailing Bag was exclusively a Yuling Sect treasure; even when given, it was only to those extremely honored friends of the sect.

Now Luo Tian had it out—everyone assumed Leng Hongcai had already considered him a future son-in-law.

“Ugh… heh…” Leng Hongcai was startled; he didn’t know where Luo Tian had obtained the Nailing Bag, so he could only laugh awkwardly.

This awkward laughter made people even more convinced that Luo Tian and Leng Hongcai had known each other long before.

“You’re doomed!” Duan Xingchen could no longer contain himself, charging at Luo Tian with his sword. His blade slashed toward Luo Tian.

“Initial Bone-Devouring… Mid-Bone-Devouring…” Luo Tian’s cultivation instantly surged to the Mid-Bone-Devouring Stage.

He clenched his fists, a battle intent surging as he faced Duan Xingchen’s charge. He swung his spear, deflecting the sword qi.

“He isn’t of the Body-Refining Stage; he’s been concealing his cultivation!”

“Why dare he enter the Bone-Devouring Stage’s high platform with just Body-Refining Ninth?” The crowd marveled.

“Is that a seal’s aura?” Zheng Hongsheng and Duan Chenfeng, along with other Soul-Realm sect leaders, had sharp eyes. They knew Luo Tian’s aura was a seal. Their conviction deepened that this Luo Lei had a massive connection with Yuling Sect, as the sect’s sealing arts were renowned in Kunlun Mountain.

As people marveled, Luo Tian and Duan Xingchen clashed. A spear met a sword in a thunderous collision, sparks flying and deafening sound.

“Tread… tread… tread…” Both men retreated simultaneously.

Duan Xingchen’s face bore shock; he hadn’t expected Luo Tian to be so formidable, even subtly suppressing him. He had used eight-tenths of his strength, yet his palm was numb. If it were a typical Mid-Bone-Devouring warrior, he would have been severely injured. Yet Luo Tian remained unaffected.

Luo Tian retreated but nodded inwardly; Duan Xingchen was truly formidable, stronger than the one he had killed earlier, Dongxing Xie. If it were him in the Northern Region, he would have no solution.

“Can this Luo Lei block Duan Xingchen’s attack?”

With a thunderous roar, Duan Xingchen transformed into a meteor and charged at Luo Tian.

“Body-Refining?” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly as he rushed toward Duan Xingchen.

The crowd marveled at Luo Tian’s decision to fight Duan Xingchen in body-refining. They had heard that Duan Xingchen cultivated by absorbing starlight, his body refined like a star. Yet Luo Tian was challenging him in this way.

“Huh…” The thunderous sound echoed as both men flew apart again, yet they seemed unaffected. They pushed off the ground and charged at each other again, their fists colliding with a resounding impact.

Spiritual energy surged; thunderous sounds filled the air as both men clashed like ferocious beasts.

“Not bad, this one truly can match Duan Xingchen in body-refining!” The crowd marveled.

Duan Chenfeng’s face bore awe; Duan Xingchen was his son, and he knew his son’s body-refining strength. Yet this Luo Lei could match Duan Xingchen in a direct clash—this was beyond his expectations.

The collision sound echoed again; both men panted heavily, separating. Duan Xingchen’s face was serious, his body showing minor cracks that vanished instantly. He gazed at Luo Tian with caution.

“Just this won’t beat me!” Luo Tian retrieved his Breaking Sky Spear, inwardly sighing that Duan Xingchen was undoubtedly the strongest Mid-Bone-Devouring warrior he had encountered.

“Don’t reveal your true nature, or you won’t win!” Luo Tian’s eyes flickered; his body erupted with five-colored spiritual energy, swirling around him. The Five Elements’ Mutual Generation and the Golden Snake’s Wild Dance manifested immediately, directing at Duan Xingchen.

“Five… five elements!” Everyone’s eyes were stunned as they watched the five-colored spiritual energy swirling around Luo Tian.

“Five Elements Body!” The three sect leaders and dozens of Soul-Realm warriors bore intense glimmers. They finally understood who this youth was, for they knew the Five Elements Body had emerged from the Northern Region’s Five Elements Sect.

Now, with this body appearing in the Eastern Region, it was easy to deduce who he was. The Five Elements Body wasn’t common; if one had appeared, the chance of another was nearly zero.

“Is he Luo Tian?” Duan Chenfeng’s face darkened, for he had known Luo Tian arrived in Kunlun Mountain. Due to the incident with the two disciples of Heaven-Sword Sect—both dead and injured—he had heard it was Luo Tian.

Recalling this, Duan Chenfeng’s aura abruptly shifted; the disciples of Heaven-Sword Sect wouldn’t die without reason. If a disciple died, he couldn’t let it go unanswered; otherwise, Heaven-Sword Sect would lose all prestige.

“Ah! He’s Luo Tian!” Zheng Hongsheng’s face showed a sudden understanding, glancing at Zheng Xin and sighing inwardly about his son’s sharp eyes.

Among the crowd, who was most shocked? It was Shangguan Fei standing before Gu Qianxue. If he didn’t know who this youth was, he wouldn’t be worthy of being a senior in the Yell-Shadow Sect.

“Why did this boy have such hostility toward me? In just two years, he’s grown so much. His talent is truly terrifying!” Shangguan Fei’s face bore intense kill intent, his eyes cold as he gazed at Luo Tian.

“Stop your thoughts! If this boy loses a single hair, I’ll kill you!” Gu Qianxue’s cold voice echoed in Shangguan Fei’s ears, snapping him back to reality.

“This is more interesting!” Duan Xingchen’s lips curled, his eyes flickering with surprise. He placed his sword in hand and swung it.

“Starry Sword!” Duan Xingchen roared, his sword gleaming like stars, piercing the air with countless cold glints.

“Hiss…” The golden dragon in the sky let out a real-world hiss, splitting into several parts and becoming swirling spiritual energy.

“Duan Senior, cheer for him!” The crowd erupted in cheers; now that the truth about Luo Tian had been exposed.

Now, their battle had escalated into a war between the Eastern and Northern Regions’ young talents.

Chapter 365: Destruction of Life

Hearing the crowd’s cheers, Duan Xingchen was stunned; his attacks intensified. He hurled his Starry Sword into the air, hands moving swiftly.

“Sword Devours the Stars!” Duan Xingchen’s face bore confidence; this was a martial art he had cultivated for years, a regional-grade technique. He had used it to defeat Bone-Devouring Initial Stage warriors and even kill them.

Yes, he had killed a Bone-Devouring Initial Stage warrior with his Body-Refining cultivation. On the Tianyuan Continent, this was rare.

The Starry Sword soared into the sky, glowing brilliantly. The heavens suddenly darkened; stars rose, casting gentle light on the Starry Sword, enhancing its luster.

“Huh…” A spiritual energy fluctuation spread; a star’s beam illuminated the Starry Sword, expanding its image.

“Hear, Duan Xingchen’s technique relies on absorbing starlight. In his Body-Refining Stage, he could absorb a hundred stars’ energy. How many can he now?” someone mused.

“Ten… a hundred… a thousand…” The Starry Sword, under the crowd’s gaze, instantly absorbed a thousand stars’ energy. Its body expanded thousands of times, resembling a massive star suspended in the sky.

Luo Tian’s gaze was serious as he stared at the hundred-zhang Starry Sword. His hands moved swiftly, left hand forming the King’s Seal, right hand the Soul-Stealing Seal. His hands slowly approached each other.

“Is he using martial arts fusion again?” Zheng Hongsheng marveled; Luo Tian had used it once in the first trial, a Yellow-grade technique with immense power. He now wondered how powerful this fusion would be in the Bone-Devouring Stage.

“These two are contemporary prodigies; calling them the best of their regions isn’t an exaggeration. I never expected two of the strongest young talents to clash before the ancient relic’s opening.” Leng Hongcai’s eyes held a touch of admiration as he watched the sword and seal.

Thunderous roars filled the air; the Yellow-Extreme Seal and Starry Sword formed slowly under everyone’s watch.

“Go!” Luo Tian and Duan Xingchen both roared, their sword and seal emitting terrifying fluctuations. They became meteors, colliding with each other.

“Boom!” A thunderous sound echoed; the two martial arts clashed and exploded, producing a sound like thunder.

“Evenly matched!” The crowd’s faces lit up with excitement.

“The Starry Sword descended, landing in Duan Xingchen’s hand. He mentally heightened his vigilance; the Starry Sword was thrown into the air again.

“Let me show you what I’ve cultivated in the stone tablet!” His hands moved swiftly again.

“Is he revealing his secret?” Duan Chenfeng’s face bore anticipation; he didn’t know what martial art Duan Xingchen had cultivated in the stone tablet. He now watched closely.

“Exposing his secrets? I’ll accept it!” Luo Tian smiled lightly, taking a deep breath. Duan Xingchen’s strength had exceeded his expectations.

“Sword Falls Starry!” Duan Xingchen, hearing Luo Tian’s calm words, felt anger. This person he had once viewed as a waste now mocked him—this caused a strong contrast in his heart.

His hands moved swiftly again; the Starry Sword emitted a hum. Duan Xingchen’s spiritual energy surged, gathering into his sword.

Under the crowd’s eager gaze, the Starry Sword transformed instantly, glowing brilliantly. It seemed to split into countless swords, filling the sky like a starry river.

“Is this what Duan Xingchen cultivated in the stone tablet?”

“Each sword’s power could rival an Upper-Grade Martial Art!” Someone trembled as they gazed at the countless Starry Swords.

“Duan Xingchen truly has talent; creating so many Starry Swords requires spiritual energy beyond a Mid-Bone-Devouring warrior. I must admit, he is the top of the Eastern Region’s young talents,” Zheng Hongsheng marveled.

Other sect leaders nodded in agreement; even a typical Upper-Grade Martial Art would harm an Initial-Soul-Realm warrior without defense.

“Flame Dragon Hand!” Luo Tian roared, a fire dragon soaring into the sky.

“A Yellow-grade Martial Art? I must be dreaming!” The crowd rubbed their eyes, staring at the fire dragon.

Though the fire dragon was massive, it seemed like a small fish compared to the countless Starry Swords. It couldn’t even block one Starry Sword.

“This move!” Huo Zhiyong and Ding Xiaoyan’s faces trembled; they knew what would follow. They still remembered the scene of Dongxing Xie and his companions being surrounded by fire.

“You’ve gone mad!”

“Go!” Duan Xingchen laughed loudly, directing the sword rain toward Luo Tian.

The fire dragon was instantly swallowed by the sword rain, turning into a shower of sparks floating in the air.

“Burn Heaven! Inferno Formation!” Luo Tian roared, his fire-element spiritual energy surging. He slammed both hands onto the ground.

“Boom…” The familiar scene unfolded before Huo Zhiyong’s eyes again.

Fire surged skyward, instantly blocking the sword rain. The heavens were filled with fire, and the scorching heat hit everyone’s faces.

“This!” The crowd was speechless; their eyes held reverence as they gazed at Luo Tian and Duan Xingchen.

Duan Xingchen’s face was the epitome of despair; he hadn’t expected his secret move to be blocked by Luo Tian. He also hadn’t anticipated Luo Tian’s many tricks, and his face paled as he realized Luo Tian had yet to use the martial art cultivated in the stone tablet.

“Now, let you see what I’ve cultivated in the stone tablet!” Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly. His wood-element spiritual energy gathered into his fists.

When it reached a certain point, the spiritual energy on his fists seemed to mutate into gray; a deathly qi emanated from Luo Tian’s hands.

“Life’s Peak is Death. This punch, Destruction of Life!” Luo Tian murmured softly and launched a punch. A dozens-zhang punch image instantly approached, striking Duan Xingchen’s body.

“Starry!” Duan Chenfeng’s face bore a hint of anxiety; as Luo Tian’s punch was unleashed, he felt an intense sense of crisis. He shouted desperately.

Chapter 366: Duan Chenfeng’s Anger

“This punch seems like a regular martial art, yet even I feel a strong sense of crisis!” Zheng Hongsheng’s face bore fear as he gazed at the gray punch.

“This is the martial art Luo Tian cultivated in the stone tablet. I don’t think it’s that impressive, do you? I’ll tell you—my martial art is better. You don’t know what’s inside that stone tablet…” Zheng Xin panted heavily, his strange pill having just worn off.

“You don’t understand!” Gu Lei and Gu Qianxue’s faces bore intense shock.

Their bodies naturally contained wood-element energy, so they could sense that Luo Tian’s punch had fully mastered the wood-element. In other words, he had grasped the essence of the wood-element and entered the legendary Soul-Realm. The greatest difficulty in entering the Soul-Realm was mastering one element’s essence.

Leng Hongcai’s face glowed with brilliance; other sect leaders also bore expressions of disbelief. As Soul-Realm masters and sect heads, they could clearly see Luo Tian had mastered the wood-element’s essence.

The gray punch image surged forth, knocking Duan Xingchen back dozens of zhang before stopping.

“Not quite,” Zheng Hongsheng slightly sensed and judged. “Halfway there; otherwise, the punch’s power would be greater.”

“Half! For a Bone-Devouring Stage warrior, that’s already difficult!” Duan Chenfeng’s face bore worry. Yet he knew he couldn’t help his son; doing so would not only lose Heaven-Sword Sect’s face but also harm Duan Xingchen’s future cultivation.

Under the crowd’s complex gazes, the gray punch image struck Duan Xingchen’s chest.

Duan Xingchen’s face bore madness; his legs stood firmly on the ground, but it was no use. The punch image pushed Duan Xingchen’s body backward continuously, creating two deep grooves under his feet.

“Seems the power isn’t that great?” The crowd’s faces bore confusion; they hadn’t expected a martial art cultivated to nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine zhang would only push Duan Xingchen back. Compared to their expectations, it was lacking.

Luo Tian’s lips curled slightly; a smile formed on his face: “Destruction of Life!”

As Luo Tian’s words fell, Duan Xingchen’s body changed under everyone’s gaze.

At first, Duan Xingchen thought he was fine, but then his face paled abruptly.

Duan Xingchen could feel he had lost something; he realized what it was.

“Vitality!”

“Duan Xingchen’s vitality is decreasing; he’s slowly aging!” The crowd marveled.

Vitality was essential for any living being; without it, death followed.

“One year… ten years… a hundred years…” As Duan Xingchen landed, he had lost a century of vitality.

A hundred years for an ordinary person was as long as a lifetime; even though Duan Xingchen was a cultivator, a hundred years’ loss was an immeasurable setback. Perhaps this loss would keep him stagnant in the Bone-Devouring Stage forever, for even a Bone-Devouring Stage warrior’s lifespan was only a thousand years.

“Damn you!” Duan Xingchen could no longer sit still; under Luo Tian’s gaze, he had already launched his second punch. If it hit, Duan Xingchen would suffer greatly.

“Stop!” Duan Chenfeng transformed into a golden light, vanishing instantly to block Duan Xingchen’s path.

At this moment, Luo Tian’s second punch had already been launched; there was no way to retract it.

“Boom…” The Destruction of Life punch struck Duan Chenfeng’s hand, emitting a heavy sound.

“Thirty years?” Luo Tian sighed; thirty years were useful for Body-Refining or Bone-Devouring Stage warriors, but negligible for Soul-Realm masters.

Duan Chenfeng deflected Luo Tian’s Destruction of Life punch, his face grim as he gently lifted Duan Xingchen. Originally, Duan Xingchen’s handsome face had faint wrinkles; he looked older, almost like an equal to Duan Chenfeng.

Duan Chenfeng gazed at Duan Xingchen, his eyes filled with pity. It was a century of vitality; unless he found an elixir to extend his life, it would be impossible to recover.

“Boy, today I’ll cripple you! No matter where you are in the Northern Region, this is Kunlun Mountain, the Eastern Region. You can’t run wild here!” Duan Chenfeng gritted his teeth, forgetting he was an elder. He only wanted to cripple Luo Tian and avenge his son.

“Old dog, if you touch him, I guarantee your Heaven-Sword Sect won’t have a single chicken or dog left within a month!” Gu Qianxue’s figure flickered, standing before Luo Tian. Three swords surged forth, her face bearing cold kill intent.

“Qianxue, return! Don’t be reckless!” Shangguan Fei shouted at Gu Qianxue, his face anxious. Yet he didn’t step forward; he was afraid that if Gu Qianxue became angry, she would strike him. Today, he might truly be left behind.

“Little girl, although you are a guest of Heaven-Sword Sect, don’t overstep. Although your strength is formidable, you won’t dare to destroy Heaven-Sword Sect!” Duan Chenfeng’s face bore disdain as he spoke. If Heaven-Sword Sect feared any sect, it wouldn’t have existed until now.

“But with these three swords, you won’t touch him today!” Gu Qianxue coldly replied.

“What’s going on?” The crowd’s eyes bore confusion; Duan Chenfeng and Gu Qianxue had instantly stood before Duan Xingchen and Luo Tian. The crowd hadn’t understood the situation yet, but they saw them clashing fiercely.

“Haha… Duan Xiong, to attack a young man like this is undignified,” Leng Hongcai smiled warmly as he appeared before Luo Tian, his face showing satisfaction. His eyes glanced at Gu Qianxue with caution.
