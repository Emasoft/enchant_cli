But before the group could enter the city, hundreds of warhorses let out loud neighs and collapsed onto the ground, nearly causing them to fall over.

“What’s going on?” The members of the Red Crimson Sect were utterly panicked, this night being far too strange, filling them with a bad premonition.

At the moment they felt some hesitation, two figures slowly stepped out from within the city gates and appeared in their line of sight.

Their white robes were as pure as snow, and even under the night sky, one could clearly see the youth’s face. A child of about seven or eight years old, his eyes filled with innocence, a small braid of seven colors tied atop his head, as if seven flames flickered above him. He was led out of the city gates by Luo Tian.

“Who are you?” The middle-aged leader shouted, his face stern, but his heart was pounding with unease.

“Rise…” Luo Tian, accompanied by Xiao Qi, extended his hand and a radiant white light flashed. A faint smile crossed his face.

In an instant, the hundreds of men’s eyes widened in shock as they realized their bodies had become unresponsive, floating upward helplessly.

“You may leave!” Luo Tian addressed the fallen warhorses, as if pardoning them.

In an instant, the horses seemed to understand Luo Tian’s words and stood up, scattering into the dark night.

“Are you Zhang Hongtao, the deputy leader of the Red Crimson Sect?” Luo Tian smiled and addressed the middle-aged man.

“I….” The man was so terrified by Luo Tian’s power that he had no words, the first time encountering such a divine being. To him, Luo Tian was nothing short of a god.

“Divine Lord, I’ve made a mistake!” Zhang Hongtao no longer thought of killing Luo Tian; his pants were soaked with fear.

“You deserve death!” Luo Tian ignored Zhang Hongtao’s words and immediately began soul-searching, scanning through the man’s memories before seizing him.

“None of them are worth anything!” Luo Tian’s face darkened as he scanned the memories of hundreds, then his hand clenched.

Though these men were strong among commoners, they were nothing compared to Luo Tian’s restored cultivation. They were reduced to a cloud of blood mist in an instant.

“Huh…” Xiao Qi’s eyes glowed, and he spat out seven-colored flames that completely incinerated the blood mist.

“Go! The days of mortals are over!” Luo Tian turned to gaze at Jietian Mountain, then took Xiao Qi’s hand and leapt into the air, becoming a long rainbow streak that soared toward Jietian Mountain.

Chapter 1364: Jietian Mountain

“Ugh…” In Luo Tian’s courtyard, young bodies lay motionless before slowly opening their eyes, confusion in their gazes.

“Did I die?” A youth spoke, staring at his intact body with disbelief.

“Yes, I remember my soul had left my body and entered a gray vortex!” Another youth added.

“Senior Brother!” The group then saw Luo Yongchun, who stood motionless with a vacant gaze. They approached him gently.

“Senior Brother, are we dreaming?” The group surrounded Luo Yongchun, helping him snap out of his trance.

“It was the Master who saved you!” Luo Yongchun’s eyes were filled with excitement as he addressed them, gazing at the gray Jietian Mountain.

At that moment, Luo Yongchun recalled Luo Tian’s power the previous night—just a few taps and his deceased brothers-in-arms were instantly restored, then another few grabs and they regained breath. Such a miraculous power had completely shattered Luo Yongchun’s understanding.

“Master…” Hearing Luo Yongchun’s words, the youths’ eyes widened in disbelief; they hadn’t expected Luo Tian to possess such divine abilities.

“Who is our Master?” They whispered among themselves, their thoughts growing more and more astonishing—resurrecting the dead was an unprecedented miracle.

“A god! The Master is a god, and yesterday he radiated divine light!” Luo Yongchun’s eyes shone with admiration.

“I’ve become a disciple of a god!” The youths became excited, never expecting Luo Tian to have such astonishing power.

“Where is the Master?” Thinking of Luo Tian as a god, they were overjoyed and eager to continue following him in pursuit of immortality.

“He’s gone to Jietian Mountain!” Luo Yongchun gazed at the gray mountain, a longing in his eyes.

“Jietian Mountain… will the Master return?” The group’s faces changed, and they fell silent, clearly filled with fear toward Jietian Mountain.

“Perhaps this is our last meeting,” Luo Yongchun sighed deeply, organizing the items Luo Tian had left behind before handing over the characters he’d left to his younger brothers.

“This is what the Master left behind; you may handle it yourselves,” Luo Yongchun told his younger brothers.

“Left by the Master?” Hearing this, their eyes lit up. Though they had known these characters were priceless before, now that they realized Luo Tian was likely a god, they cherished them even more.

After receiving the characters, the brothers returned home with joy and excitement.

Luo Yongchun remained in Luo Tian’s place, hanging the characters on the wall and worshiping them. He gazed at the powerful calligraphy in a trance.

“Dao!” Luo Tian had left only one character for Luo Yongchun, the most satisfactory one he’d crafted in ten years—incorporating all three thousand paths into a single character.

As for what happened in Jietian City afterward, Luo Tian no longer cared; he knew this was merely a small memory of his and not part of his true world.

The gray mountain stretched across the sky, its immense presence making even Luo Tian feel a sense of awe. His heart stirred with excitement.

“No matter where this is, no matter if I can obtain the inheritance, I must walk out of here!” Luo Tian murmured to himself before stepping onto the gray mountain.

“Earlier, the residual image of Jietian’s master had said that more than one stone tablet leads into this inheritance. My tablet was just a key to open it. I wonder if others have entered, but probably not—after all, I’ve been here for ten years without seeing anyone else or the royal family enter.” Luo Tian murmured to himself, his mind tense as he stepped onto the mountain path.

Ten years of no cultivation had strengthened Luo Tian’s character, and now he radiated an ethereal aura. His white robes flowed as he walked along the mountain path.

The gray mountain was barren, with some structures around it, but time had worn them down.

A gray aura spread across the mountain, obscuring Luo Tian’s vision and deepening his expression. Though Jietian’s master had said there was no danger, after so many eras, Luo Tian wasn’t sure if anything terrible had changed.

After walking a hundred paces, he suddenly frowned as an altar appeared before him. On the altar sat a withered skeleton, its bones glowing white—clearly a power from an era. Though Luo Tian didn’t know the exact rank, the skeleton exuded pressure, indicating its strength was formidable.

“Su Xiangyu, a member of the Ancient Royal Clan, a powerhouse from the later era of Star Moon Divine Race. I subdued him here!” A stone tablet stood beside the altar, causing Luo Tian to startle. The tablet recorded this powerful being’s background.

“Star Moon Divine Race!” Luo Tian had a special sentiment toward the Star Moon Divine Race; now seeing one of their warriors fallen here, he sighed in melancholy.

“A complete skeleton with no wounds—clearly it was worn down by time, finally sitting in meditation and passing away on this altar!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, marveling at time’s power. Even a being of such high cultivation and an era master who had subdued the heavens and earth would eventually succumb to time’s passage.

“I have a connection with the Star Moon Divine Race; I’ll send this elder off!” Luo Tian spoke softly, collecting the skeleton and burying it in a hole he dug. The altar, which had once restrained an era-level power, had long since lost its divine essence and shattered the moment Luo Tian stepped on it.

Luo Tian continued forward, and as he climbed higher, he saw many altars. Each had a withered skeleton—some from the Ancient Royal Clans, others from humans. All were powerful in life but now lay subdued here, with stone tablets recording their past lives.

Luo Tian marveled at the sight while a bad premonition stirred in his heart. Finally, when he saw an empty altar, his heart sank.

“No one!” Luo Tian stared at the vacant altar, stunned. His skin prickled with goosebumps.

“Tuyuanlong, an era peak power, subdued here in my later years! A bloodline powerhouse!” Luo Tian read the inscription on the tablet, his heart jolted.

“He must have died…” Luo Tian shivered, thinking of these ancient figures. If they hadn’t died, this Jietian Mountain would be a death trap.

“Definitely dead; if not, these ancient figures could have reversed the situation!” Luo Tian reassured himself, but then he noticed more altars with no bodies—each had an era peak power.

“Truly a ghost story! If they’re alive, where have they gone?” Luo Tian’s mood darkened, sensing something strange about Jietian Mountain. Though so much time had passed, these people must have died long ago, but Luo Tian felt a vague sense that they might exist in another form.

“Never mind; if they’re alive, their strength must have declined significantly. Burn them all!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his voice cold as the flame mark on his forehead flickered.

“Alright, it’s not time for you to come out yet; stay put,” Luo Tian soothed Xiao Qi before continuing forward.

Soon, Luo Tian reached a grand hall’s entrance, his expression filled with tension. So much time had passed, yet the hall still stood—clearly no ordinary place. The沧桑 (ancient aura) of the hall blocked his vision, and he tensed as he stepped inside.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian entered the hall, waves of energy enveloped him, a familiar aura that made him smile.

“This is the aura of a small world!” Luo Tian gazed at the gray sky around him, sighing deeply.

“Jietian’s master is truly extraordinary; I haven’t even reached the mountain’s halfway point, yet I’ve already encountered a small world!” Luo Tian murmured to himself while scanning the surroundings.

“Someone’s here!” His expression suddenly darkened as he saw three figures flying toward him.

Three figures, their attire tattered but their auras formidable. Their faces were old, and the power of time was strong on them—Luo Tian felt they were near their end.

“Who are you? A new arrival?” The elder with era-initial strength looked at Luo Tian and spoke softly.

“Who are you? Why are you so powerful?” One of the era-late elders spoke, his voice weak—evidently near death.

“I’m Luo Tian; I accidentally entered this mountain!” Luo Tian spoke softly, his gaze cautious as he observed the three elders.

As Luo Tian conversed with the three elders, a gray stone tablet suddenly crashed into Jietian Mountain’s halfway point. A crimson-robed youth leaped out from the tablet.

“Haha! My luck is truly divine! Just picking up a broken stone, and I’ve gained an astonishing inheritance!” Blood-red fangs protruded from the youth’s mouth as he laughed, heading toward the mountain peak.

Chapter 1365: How to Escape?

“Ah, you also entered by mistake!” Hearing Luo Tian’s words, the elders shook their heads in sorrow.

“Who are you, elders?” Luo Tian asked cautiously, still maintaining a safe distance. Though the three elders’ auras were formidable, Luo Tian noticed they might be near death—his strength combined with Xiao Qi’s would easily overcome them.

“Have you ever been to Jietian City?” The era-late elder spoke weakly, as if each word cost him his last breath.

“Yes, I have,” Luo Tian’s mind stirred as he observed the elders’ attire and made a guess.

“Jietian City, we are from Jietian City. We were curious and entered Jietian Mountain, but we never expected to be trapped here for so long!” The elder with era-initial strength spoke.

“I’m Ge Youcai,” the elder introduced himself, then pointed to another: “He’s Wang Dazhuang.”

“He’s Tian DaXing!” The elder introduced the three, a bitter smile on his face.

“Indeed!” Luo Tian observed their simple attire—though powerful, they wore clothes like those of farmers. He believed Ge Youcai’s words.

“Three elders, why are you here?” Luo Tian asked, his gaze filled with curiosity. The three looked like they had been trapped for a long time; if they could escape, they would be formidable in Jietian City.

“Alas…” Hearing Luo Tian’s question, the three elders sighed deeply. Ge Youcai then spoke softly.

They had all been from Jietian City but not of the same generation. However, they shared a common trait: curiosity had led them to Jietian Mountain, and without knowing why, they were instantly transported into this gray small world.

After entering, they had gained a mysterious technique in their minds. At first, they didn’t know what it was, but due to extreme hunger, they had no choice but to practice endlessly.

“Alas… over the years, many have entered here, but most died!” The three elders sighed softly, their voices filled with helplessness.

“Death has come,” Luo Tian felt sympathy for the three elders, trapped in this gray space for years and waiting to die.

“Is there no way out?” Luo Tian furrowed his brows, gazing at the seemingly endless space. He had entered similar small worlds before but knew there must be an exit.

“We’ve flown around most of this place and found a spot, but there was something terrifying there. We were five people originally; two died because of it.”

“Where is it? Take me there. Perhaps I can find a way!” Luo Tian smiled, his tone indifferent—no matter what, he couldn’t stay here forever.

“No, it’s too dangerous! That thing is a devil!” The era-late Tian DaXing looked terrified, shaking his head.

“Yes, it was terrifying! Our two companions were swallowed up instantly!” The other two elders nodded quickly.

“Don’t worry, I’ll be fine!” Luo Tian smiled confidently.

“Alright, better to take a chance than die here!” Tian DaXing looked at Luo Tian and nodded slightly, his eyes filled with madness.

Ge Youcai and Wang Dazhuang exchanged glances before nodding as well, addressing Luo Tian: “But first, if there’s real danger, we won’t protect you!”

“Understood. I can take care of myself,” Luo Tian nodded, then followed the three elders toward the spot they indicated.

During their flight, Luo Tian shook his head slowly—these three moved too slowly, clearly only understanding basic techniques. Even the era-late elder’s speed was far slower than a normal era-late.

Not long after, they reached an altar’s entrance. The massive altar emitted a gusty wind, and a heart-stirring aura filled Luo Tian’s mind.

“What is this?” Luo Tian frowned, sensing the altar’s uniqueness. As they approached it, the three elders suddenly retreated, fear in their eyes.

“Here we are!” Ge Youcai and the others stood behind Luo Tian, watching the altar swallowing gray mist.

Luo Tian activated his Purple Extreme Demon Eyes, piercing through space to see the dense gray mist. He felt a powerful entity within it.

“Soul!” Luo Tian quickly saw a gray soul at the altar’s center, its brows furrowed.

“An era-late soul?” Luo Tian quickly determined the soul’s rank, his mind slightly relieved—though challenging, he had a chance.

“Roar…” The gray soul opened its eyes, two cold glares bursting forth. Upon seeing Luo Tian, the soul’s eyes gleamed with greed.

“Such strong vitality and soul! After devouring you, my strength will surely improve! This body is also good!” The soul’s voice echoed.

“After waiting so long, I’ve finally found a decent body! I, Minglin, am ready to leave!” The soul spoke softly, its voice carrying an ancient aura.

“Minglin!” Hearing the soul’s name, Luo Tian’s face darkened instantly—this was a member of the ancient race that Jietian’s master had subdued.

“Indeed, there was something fishy!” Luo Tian shivered, recalling the empty altars. His mind grew more cautious.

“Hum…” As Luo Tian pondered, three gusts of wind rose behind him and struck him instantly.

“Hmph, you couldn’t wait? Your acting isn’t good enough!” Luo Tian’s lips curled as he turned, white light flashing from his body. He launched three punches.

“Boom… boom… boom…” The powerful sound echoed in the silent space.

“What’s happening!” Tian DaXing and the others looked shocked, never expecting Luo Tian to know they would attack.

The three elders were repelled by Luo Tian’s power, spitting blood and looking weak.

“Cough… cough…” Though Luo Tian repelled them, his body was also thrown back and landed in the altar.

“Master, please enjoy!” Seeing Luo Tian enter the altar, their hearts relaxed, and they bowed respectfully to the altar.

“Haha!” As Luo Tian fell onto the altar, the gray soul laughed and transformed into a massive mouth, swallowing Luo Tian.

“Kid, don’t resist! Your soul is strong, but it’s weak before me!” Minglin’s soul rushed into Luo Tian’s body, devouring his soul.

“Old fool, you’re strong, but you’ve met me!” Luo Tian laughed coldly and began to resist.

Two souls clashed within Luo Tian’s body, a life-or-death battle. Luo Tian showed no fear.

“Die!” Minglin was excited, entering Luo Tian’s body and feeling his vitality.

“Old fool, you’ve found your end! If it were anyone else, they would have been devoured by you. But you’ve met me—this one who should be dead will now die!” Luo Tian remained calm, his body radiating a fierce aura. His forehead’s seven-colored mark flickered, emitting intense heat.

“Xiao Qi, rely on you!” Luo Tian smiled softly, the gray soul unable to escape his body.

“Got it!” A childish voice echoed in Luo Tian’s mind. Instantly, seven-colored flames erupted from his dantian, roaring as they surrounded Luo Tian’s body.

“Ah…” In an instant, the seven-colored dragon caught Minglin’s powerful soul, its terrifying temperature causing Minglin to howl.

“Damn it, what fire is this!” Minglin’s soul was instantly ignited by the seven-colored flames and couldn’t extinguish them.

“Heavenly fire! Damn it, stronger than heavenly fire—what is this!” Minglin felt despair.

Heavenly fire was a soul’s weakness, let alone something stronger than it by several times. Xiao Qi, who had formed a human shape, burned Minglin’s soul to near nothing in moments.

“Leave!” Luo Tian smiled softly, his forehead glowing as Xiao Qi appeared on the altar, a flame-like figure holding a gray soul before Luo Tian, looking proud.

“Alright! Don’t burn him to death!” Luo Tian patted Xiao Qi’s head, smiling as he grabbed the soul, now at its weakest.

“Now, do you still want to devour me?” Luo Tian’s lips curled as he addressed the ghostly soul, his tone mocking.

“What happened? Our master…” Ge Youcai and the others were stunned, watching the soul now in Luo Tian’s grasp. Their hearts trembled.

Chapter 1366: Path of Thorny Challenges

“Master was defeated!” Ge Youcai and the others looked shocked, watching Luo Tian holding Minglin’s soul on the altar.

They had spent millions of years in this small world, helping Minglin lure those who entered here to be devoured. They knew Minglin’s strength well.

This time, Luo Tian had entered and they felt his unusual power—those brought in from Jietian City were ordinary people, but Luo Tian clearly had cultivation. His aura was strong, so they dared not fight directly and instead tricked him here to attack.

But they hadn’t expected Minglin, so powerful, to be burned by Luo Tian’s fire. It was beyond their imagination.

“It must be the fire!” They quickly realized Xiao Qi, standing beside Luo Tian, was the cause.

“Correct. Otherwise I would have perished here. Now we can settle our score!” Luo Tian smiled calmly, stepping down from the altar and looking at them with amusement.

“But that fire is strange—it weakens our master. I feel his strength isn’t so strong. If we fight together, we can kill him!” The strongest among them, Tian DaXing, looked coldly at Luo Tian.

“Right! Killing him will let us escape!” Ge Youcai and Wang Dazhuang also glowed with determination.

They were now at their end, but they still wanted to escape this space and see the outside world.

“Have you killed many from Jietian City who came into this space?” Luo Tian clenched his fists, his gaze cold.

“Even if so, it’s survival of the fittest. If we didn’t send them out, they would have died instead of us. What else could we do?” They answered loudly, their personalities twisted after so long in this space.

“Kill your way out!” They roared, rushing toward Luo Tian, but Luo Tian’s eyes showed disdain.

“Want to escape? Three madmen. You didn’t even attack me, killing so many humans. If you escaped, Jietian City would face a disaster. So stay here forever!” Luo Tian faced their attack without fear, his steps activating the Yin Shadow Ghost Step and vanishing from their sight.

“With just your skills, you can’t kill me!” Luo Tian’s cold voice echoed in the void. He suddenly appeared behind Ge Youcai, launching a terrifying punch.

Wind roared in Ge Youcai’s ears. In an instant, his face changed, surprise in his eyes as he spat blood and his body cracked.

Blood mist spread under the gray space, and Luo Tian’s figure appeared before Tian DaXing and Wang Dazhuang as the mist faded.

“Such fast speed! Who are you!” Tian DaXing and Wang Dazhuang looked at Ge Youcai’s fading blood mist, fear in their eyes.

“You’re definitely not from Jietian City!” Tian DaXing spoke, his gray hand slamming toward Luo Tian.

“Only simple attacks? Seems your master didn’t treat you well!” Luo Tian showed disdain, using the Dao of Sealing Magic combined with the power to break all methods. He struck Tian DaXing’s hand, shattering it instantly.

“Next is you!” Luo Tian looked at the era-mid Tian DaXing, his eyes like a cold pool.

“Damn it!” Wang Dazhuang felt fear and roared, fleeing toward the altar. He no longer wanted to kill Luo Tian but escape this cursed space—after all, Minglin was now subdued and no one blocked the exit.

“Xiao Qi, burn him!” But as Wang Dazhuang stepped onto the altar, Luo Tian’s voice echoed in the void.

“Ah…” A white and tender boy appeared before Wang Dazhuang, his eyes lively with fire flickering within. His seven-colored braid swayed like flames.

Xiao Qi opened his mouth and spewed seven-colored fire, instantly filling the altar with flames. Serpentine fire dragons devoured Wang Dazhuang’s old body.

Smoke rose, and within a breath, Wang Dazhuang vanished from Luo Tian’s sight. His gaze shifted to the last remaining Tian DaXing.

“You’re the only one left!” Luo Tian glanced at him, who stood trembling and looking at Luo Tian.

“Master, mercy!” Tian DaXing fell to his knees in the void, trembling and bowing repeatedly.

“…”

Luo Tian was speechless at Tian DaXing’s lack of backbone; despite being an era-late powerhouse, even in the Nine Domains or Origin Domain he would be top-tier. Yet now he knelt before Luo Tian.

Luo Tian realized it—Tian DaXing was still just a commoner from Jietian City. Though strong, his mindset remained the same; he was afraid of death and had submitted to Minglin.

“Die!” But as Luo Tian sighed, Tian DaXing suddenly rushed forward, his body transforming into a gray storm toward Luo Tian. His voice carried resentment—knowing Luo Tian would never let him live.

“Old fool, I’ve seen more in my life than your age! You’re not smart enough to play tricks with me!” Luo Tian’s eyes glowed coldly, unshaken. His golden foot extended into a golden holy mountain, crushing Tian DaXing with the power of Fierce God’s Wrath Tramples the Nine Heavens.

“What is this!” Tian DaXing hadn’t expected Luo Tian’s reaction so fast; his old body was still mid-flight when he saw the golden foot.

“Boom…” Blood splattered, and Tian DaXing’s old body shattered into mist, scattering in Luo Tian’s sight.

“Die!” Luo Tian spoke softly, glancing at Xiao Qi on the altar. Xiao Qi opened his mouth and spewed fire, burning Tian DaXing’s mist to nothing.

“Done. Now let’s see what useful information I can extract from Minglin,” Luo Tian smiled, waving his hand to release the ghostly soul.

“Kid, free me! I’m from the Ming clan; if you let me go, I’ll give you endless benefits!” Minglin’s ghostly soul looked at Luo Tian, fear in his eyes.

“Speak up! Who else is still alive among those subdued by Jietian’s master? How are they surviving—like you, as a soul?” Luo Tian spoke softly, his tone cold.

“I’ll tell you? You won’t kill me?” Minglin tested, his voice carrying a hint of negotiation.

“Ah…” But before Minglin could finish speaking, seven-colored flames fell onto his soul, burning it.

“Don’t test my limits!” Luo Tian held the seven-colored flames in his hand, a smile on his face.

“Damn it!” Minglin cursed inwardly and spoke softly: “If I’m not mistaken, there were six of us in total. But I don’t know if they’re still alive. I was the last to escape, and my strength was weakest, so I think they might still be alive. As for whether they live as flesh or like me with a soul, I don’t know.”

“Hmm. Then how to escape from here?” Luo Tian asked Minglin, his gaze on him.

“Escape? It’s simple—gain Jun Moshang’s (Jietian’s master) inheritance!”

“But obtaining the inheritance isn’t easy. You must defeat this mountain’s spirit guardian. We’ve spent years trying but never defeated it, so we were trapped here for so long. Eventually, we had to seal ourselves or find other ways to escape.”

“There’s another way: it’s said that if you collect the keys to enter this place, you can open a space and leave. I think there are three stone tablets in total; if you get all of them, you can open the space. But over these years, I’ve never seen anyone enter with a key.” Minglin’s eyes showed fear as he looked at the flame dancing between Luo Tian’s fingers.

“Keys, inheritance, and those other old figures who are still alive!” Luo Tian felt this Jietian Mountain was tricky.

“No matter what, I must escape eventually. I wonder if the other two with keys have come yet.” Luo Tian sighed softly, gazing at the gray altar. A light appeared in his sight.

“Let’s go!” Luo Tian sighed deeply, his voice confident. No matter what, he had to keep moving forward.

“Ah…” As Luo Tian stepped out, a piercing scream echoed through the small world.

“Kid, you won’t have a good end! Those people were all geniuses in their time. Each had the talent of an era master when young. You’ll surely die!” Minglin’s scream faded gradually.

“Hum…” A ball of seven-colored flames flew out of the small world and was swallowed by Xiao Qi.

“Out!” Luo Tian sighed, gazing at the unreachable mountain peak above him with a smile.

“Xiao Qi, go back! Ahead, there might be danger!” Luo Tian addressed Xiao Qi, his tone serious.

Chapter 1367: Cliff

The gray Jietian Mountain stretched endlessly, its towering peaks piercing the sky. Luo Tian walked along the gray mountain path, his face tense.

The more he advanced, the stronger the sense of invisible danger became. After walking for half an hour, he finally reached a mountain peak and stood on it. Even with his current cultivation, he couldn’t see the base of Jietian Mountain, as if it were shrouded in mist.

“Jietian’s master, Jun Moshang, the second era master of humanity. He once evaded the Heaven’s Decline here. I wonder if he hadn’t yet become an era master when his Heaven’s Decline occurred, and why he returned here. Why did he build this Jietian Mountain with supreme power? Were the people of Jietian City brought in by Jietian’s master, or were they originally there?” Luo Tian murmured as he approached a dilapidated hall.
