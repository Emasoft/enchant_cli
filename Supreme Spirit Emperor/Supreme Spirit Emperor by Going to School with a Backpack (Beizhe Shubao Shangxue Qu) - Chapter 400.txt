“Your strength is indeed formidable, but you’ve forgotten—my specialty isn’t frontal combat. It’s assassination!” Yan Haobo spoke softly, his gaze heavy as he locked eyes with Lu Tian before vanishing from sight.

“Hmph?” At the moment Yan Haobo disappeared, Lu Tian’s vast divine awareness spread outward. Yet moments later, his brows furrowed tightly.

Lu Tian had never taken the Sect of the Demon King’s assassination techniques seriously, considering his divine awareness unparalleled even stronger than his physical form. Who could hide from him?

But when Yan Haobo vanished, Lu Tian realized his mistake—despite spreading his awareness, he still couldn’t locate Yan Haobo.

Chapter 1580: Killing Yan Haobo

On the blood-red arena, Lu Tian stood with a solemn expression, his eyes flickering with violet light as he scanned the surroundings. Since his divine awareness failed to find Yan Haobo, Lu Tian attempted to locate him with his eyes. After all, failing to find Yan Haobo was no good news for him.

“Pf!” As Lu Tian searched intently, a blood-red energy spear suddenly shot from behind him, lunging toward him.

“Damn it!” Lu Tian’s face darkened as he sensed an immense threat the moment the spear appeared. Thanks to his cultivation of the Sealing King’s Martial Art, he instinctively dodged.

Though Lu Tian reacted swiftly, the spear’s sudden emergence left him unable to evade its core. It pierced his shoulder instead.

“Pf!” Blood erupted from Lu Tian’s shoulder, and the spear exploded upon his flesh, sending a chilling aura through his body.

“Lu Tian is in danger!” Yan Hongtao’s face darkened as he watched the blood spurt from Lu Tian’s shoulder, speaking softly.

“Why? Lu Tian’s divine awareness is several times stronger than ours. How could he miss Yan Haobo?” Cao Dedu and the others marveled, their gazes shifting to Yan Hongtao.

“Sect of the Demon King’s body and Void Dao Body—these are innate assassin bodies. When combined with a powerful assassination technique, no one can escape their strikes!” Yan Hongtao spoke softly, his tone laced with admiration.

Yan Hongtao himself was a killer by nature, an expert in assassination. Among the Nine Domains, those who could evade his strikes were fewer than ten.

Now that Yan Hongtao praised Yan Haobo’s assassination skills, it was clear how formidable they were. Coupled with his innate assassin body—the Sect of the Demon King’s Nascent Soul—Yan Haobo was undoubtedly the top assassin in the Nine Domains.

“Freaking变态!” Hearing Yan Hongtao’s words, Cao Dedu and the others grew even more anxious. Their eyes remained fixed on Lu Tian standing defiantly on the arena.

“Kid, die!” Yan Haobo’s cold voice echoed in Lu Tian’s ears. Though he made a sound, Lu Tian only caught a faint trace of his movement.

“Annoying opponent!” Lu Tian’s thoughts were equally grim, desperately pondering how to locate Yan Haobo. This passive stance was unbearable.

“Pf!” As Lu Tian mused, Yan Haobo struck again with terrifying force, the blood-red spear piercing Lu Tian’s abdomen.

“Not bad reflexes, but I wonder how many times you can dodge!” Yan Haobo’s voice echoed again, laced with admiration but also unwavering confidence.

“Indeed, the son of the Epoch Lord of the Sect of the Demon King—this unparalleled assassination technique combined with the Nascent Soul Body. If he attains the status of a potential Epoch Lord, who in the Nine Domains could escape Yan Haobo’s assassination?”

“Lu Tian is nothing. Even with the potential to ascend, he’ll die here in the Sect of the Demon King!”

“Yan Haobo of the Sect of the Demon King will surely conquer through assassination, leading our sect to dominate the Nine Domains!” The people of the Sect of the Demon King cheered, watching the blood-red barrier.

As they marveled, Lu Tian’s body spewed more blood, re-wetting the already dried crimson. Though none of the wounds were fatal, they left Lu Tian pale-faced.

“Can’t stay passive anymore!” Lu Tian mused, his thoughts turning to his strategies. His eyes flashed with resolute light as he gazed at the vast arena.

“This arena is large, but it’s still no match for a continent. Distance has its limits! So Yan Haobo, no matter how formidable, won’t leave this arena!” Lu Tian murmured to himself, his hands moving swiftly.

“Buzz…” Seven-colored seals flared at Lu Tian’s forehead, and seven long dragons of light surged from his hands toward the vast barrier. Each dragon radiated terrifying heat.

“Why are you recklessly using martial arts? This fire is fearsome, but it won’t harm me. Just die here and accept your fate!” Yan Haobo’s voice echoed again, this time the blood-red spear nearly piercing Lu Tian’s heart.

Yet Lu Tian acted as if unaware, continuously launching seven-colored fire dragons. Within moments, the entire arena was filled with them.

“Die!” Yan Haobo’s cold voice echoed through the arena as the blood-red spear pierced Lu Tian’s heart, who was panting heavily.

“Eight Directions of the World—Fallen Treasure!” Lu Tian’s eyes also held coldness. An invisible wave radiated from him, and the spear embedded in his heart suddenly halted before emitting a buzzing sound. It violently reversed, flying back from Lu Tian’s heart.

“How is this possible!” A voice of disbelief echoed through the void.

“I don’t believe it—I’ll find you! Burn!” Lu Tian pressed his hands against the void, and the roaring fire dragons dispersed before exploding into a vast sea of flames. Instantly, the entire arena was submerged in fire.

The terrifying heat pierced the void, leaving no gaps. Even the sturdy barrier seemed to melt under this unbearable temperature.

“Damn it!” Within the seven-colored flames, a blood-red figure suddenly appeared in Lu Tian’s vision, causing his lips to twitch slightly.

“If we were in space, I might have been helpless. But here on this arena, your range is limited. Finding you isn’t impossible!” Lu Tian spoke softly, watching Yan Haobo battling the seven-colored flames.

“This time, it’s my turn. I’ll definitely kill you!” Lu Tian moved his hands, and the Buddha Heaven Attack Art unfolded in his grasp. Golden light surged forth, and a golden palace seemed to be bathed in the seven-colored flames, emerging from Lu Tian’s hands. It radiated the aura of an Epoch Relic and descended upon Yan Haobo with a thunderous roar.

“Epoch Relic!” The crowd gasped, including Yan Haobo who also displayed disbelief in his eyes.

“Damn it! Shura Blade, come to me!” Seeing Lu Tian unleash an Epoch Relic, Yan Haobo called out for the Sect of the Demon King’s Epoch Relic.

Yet this arena was truly extraordinary—it not only isolated combat energy but also blocked all spiritual senses. Despite Yan Haobo’s calls, the Sect of the Demon King’s Epoch Relic remained motionless.

“You can die now!” Lu Tian spoke softly, watching Yan Haobo in the fire sea. His heart felt relieved; if Yan Haobo had summoned an Epoch Relic, it would have complicated things.

“Boom!” A golden palace radiating overwhelming pressure appeared above Yan Haobo’s head, causing his face to pale instantly.

“Lu Tian, dare you kill me?” Yan Haobo shouted, his voice trembling with fear. He had truly faced a life-or-death crisis now.

“Lu Tian, stop!” The people of the Sect of the Demon King erupted into chaos, their gazes turning to Lu Tian in the fire sea. They threatened him.

“Lu Tian, if you strike, we’ll never forgive you!” The people of the Sect of the Demon King shouted loudly. Among them, the three elders Yan Haobo brought were most vocal; after all, Yan Haobo was their powerful support. If he died, their positions wouldn’t be pleasant either.

“If the son of an Epoch Lord dies, your friends will also die with him!” The three elders shouted, instantly appearing before Cao Dedu and the others.

“Boom…” With their leadership, many strong warriors of the Sect of the Demon King surrounded Cao Dedu and the others. Their overwhelming killing intent surged toward them.

“You dare! Don’t you fear becoming the second clan?” Sun Mengru’s eyes flashed with coldness. Her golden sword erupted with ten thousand feet of brilliance, appearing above her head.

She had been holding back for a long time since Yan Haobo insulted her. Standing behind Lu Tian, she knew he wouldn’t disappoint her.

“Damn it! Just a fight—almost wiped out the divine clan. Now let’s see what this Sect of the Demon King has to offer!” Cao Dedu and the others spoke loudly, their auras rising.

“You all dare to rebel!” Yan Hongtao finally spoke, his gaze sweeping over the people of the Sect of the Demon King.

“This…” Upon hearing Yan Hongtao’s words, many people gradually retreated from the crowd. After all, Yan Hongtao was still the Lord of the Sect of the Demon King; his past authority remained.

“They’ll die if even a single hair of them is harmed! I’ll kill him today!” Lu Tian spoke coldly, then pressed his hand downward.

The golden palace descended from the heavens, crushing Yan Haobo’s pale face with overwhelming pressure.

“Ah…” Yan Haobo screamed, his body erupting in red light. Now without any escape route, he fought with all his might. Even in this desperate situation, Yan Haobo hadn’t considered giving up.

“Boom!” The golden palace slammed onto Yan Haobo’s body, blood splattering everywhere and instantly consumed by the seven-colored flames.

“Lu Tian, I’ll fight you to the death!” Yan Haobo’s soul roared in the seven-colored flames, transforming into a gray streak that rushed toward Lu Tian.

“Annihilation of the Soul!” Seeing the gray soul, Lu Tian didn’t even glance at it. His cold voice echoed again.

Chapter 1581: The Second

Yan Haobo’s soul rushed to Lu Tian’s front. Lu Tian wore a contemptuous expression, his body radiating immense pressure. This pressure was like a king to souls, impossible to resist.

“What…” Yan Haobo’s face was filled with terror as he halted under Lu Tian’s pressure.

“Kneel!” Lu Tian spoke softly, his voice not loud but like a decree in Yan Haobo’s ears.

“You…” Yan Haobo’s gray soul, unable to control itself, slowly knelt before Lu Tian. His eyes were filled with disbelief. Though he struggled desperately, it was futile!

“Die!” Lu Tian spoke softly, showing no mercy. His words were law; Yan Haobo’s soul shattered instantly, turning into swirling gray mist that vanished from sight.

The crowd gasped in astonishment as the people of the Sect of the Demon King stared at the soul energy drifting into the air. They hadn’t expected Lu Tian to kill Yan Haobo without hesitation.

“Buzz…” The humming echoed, and the blood-red barrier on the arena vanished from sight. Lu Tian stood coldly on the blood-red arena.

“He’s truly dead. The Sect of the Demon King only opens when one dies!” People immediately started murmuring.

The three elders who had come with Yan Haobo were pale-faced, their eyes filled with resentment as they gazed at Lu Tian. They had found a powerful support and improved their status in the Sect of the Demon King. Now Yan Haobo’s death meant they would be awkwardly positioned under Yan Hongtao.

“He should feel honored—he’s the first son of an Epoch Lord killed by Lu Tian!” Cao Dedu and the others cautiously watched the people of the Sect of the Demon King but still mocked them.

“Kill them!” Someone shouted, igniting the anger of the people surrounding Cao Dedu and the others. Yan Haobo’s death was a heavy blow to the Sect of the Demon King.

“Buzz…” Glows rose from everyone, and the overwhelming energy of the enraged Sect of the Demon King warriors surged toward Sun Mengru and Zheng Xin, while martial arts formed in their hands.

“Stop!” Yan Hongtao shouted loudly, his gaze sweeping over the people of the Sect of the Demon King. His eyes were cold as he flew into the sky.

“Are you rebelling? If you stop now, I’ll pretend nothing happened!” Yan Hongtao glared at the people about to attack.

“Lord, our Epoch Lord’s son was killed by Lu Tian here in the Sect of the Demon King. If this spreads, where will our dignity be?” One elder spoke loudly, his voice laced with a subtle temptation.

“Boom!” Before the elder could finish speaking, Yan Hongtao’s figure appeared before him. A blood-red blade pierced the elder’s throat.

“Gurgle…” Blood gushed from the elder’s throat, his face filled with resentment. He was then turned into a mist by Yan Hongtao’s hand and devoured by the blood-red spear.

“Eighth Elder, he’s dead!” The people of the Sect of the Demon King gasped in shock, their gazes turning to Yan Hongtao.

They naturally recognized the deceased elder—Eighth Elder of the Sect of the Demon King, a cultivator at the late Epoch stage. Since Yan Haobo’s awakening, this elder had followed him like a lackey.

“Sect of the Demon King’s arena is a life-or-death battle. Who wins lives, who loses dies. If he died, it’s his own fault for lacking ability. Now that he won, you want to kill him? That’s truly shameful!” Yan Hongtao spoke loudly, his voice carrying authority.

“Also, can you kill him now? The divine clan was strong before—what’s their current status?”

“We of the Sect of the Demon King don’t fear anyone, but I don’t think we’re stronger than the divine clan.”

“Even if we killed Lu Tian, could we withstand their fury after intercepting three great elders of the ancient clan?” Yan Hongtao spoke loudly, his eyes cold.

Hearing Yan Hongtao’s words, the people of the Sect of the Demon King fell silent. Those who lived in the Sect of the Demon King were all skilled; each was a top-tier assassin, and they certainly had sharp minds. This was the basic quality of an assassin.

After silence, their auras gradually calmed down, and those surrounding Lu Tian quietly dispersed.

“This…” Seeing people disperse, the other two elders who had followed Yan Haobo became isolated, their faces flushed red as they stood there.

“Two elders? Do you have anything to say about my words?” Yan Hongtao’s gaze was sharp as he looked at the two elders, his lips slightly upturned.

“No… no courage…” They quickly bowed and retreated into the crowd, though they were reluctant. They knew from now on they’d have to walk with their tails between their legs.

“Alright, everyone disperse!” Yan Hongtao smiled, addressing the people of the Sect of the Demon King.

The crowd dispersed, leaving Lu Tian and his group. Cao Dedu and the others sighed in relief; if they had truly fought, they wouldn’t have been able to leave safely from the Sect of the Demon King’s base.

“Yan Hongtao, you were really impressive earlier!” Cao Dedu and the others looked at people leaving, returning to their usual irreverent demeanor. They teased Yan Hongtao.

“Liar, you just saved us! Are you mocking me?” Yan Hongtao glared at Cao Dedu and the others, his mood instantly souring.

“Thank you for your help this time!” Lu Tian’s eyes were filled with gratitude as he bowed to Yan Hongtao.

Originally, Lu Tian and his group had sought Yan Hongtao’s help, but they hadn’t expected to kill the son of an Epoch Lord in his own domain. This would severely damage the Sect of the Demon King’s reputation.

“It’s fine!” Yan Hongtao shook his head lightly. He had long disliked Yan Haobo but hadn’t found a suitable reason until now. Lu Tian killing Yan Haobo had essentially helped him.

“I’ll remember this favor. When you need me, just say the word!” Lu Tian’s face showed a touch of gratitude as he looked at Yan Hongtao.

“Don’t worry, there’s one thing I need your help with!” Yan Hongtao spoke, his eyes carrying a hint of amusement.

“Wow, Yan Hongtao, you’re too fast! Did you plan this in advance? Planning to make a big request!” Cao Dedu and the others groaned at Yan Hongtao’s words.

“Yan Brother, what is it?” Lu Tian nodded, signaling Cao Dedu and the others to stay quiet.

“I want to borrow the Immortal-Reviving Elixir!” Yan Hongtao sighed deeply, his eyes filled with a hint of emotion.

“Immortal-Reviving Elixir!” Hearing Yan Hongtao’s words, Lu Tian furrowed his brows slightly, his eyes filled with concern. The Immortal-Reviving Elixir existed in the Four Sacred Star Domains, and there were more than one—such as the Purple Heaven Lotus and the Qiankun Life Tree. Even Jiang Nanxuan was considered an Immortal-Reviving Elixir.

But the Immortal-Reviving Elixir was extremely precious, and Lu Tian couldn’t help but carefully consider it. After all, the Sect of the Demon King had already shown ill intent over a single seed of the Immortal-Reviving Elixir.

“I know my request is excessive, but we truly need the Immortal-Reviving Elixir!” Yan Hongtao looked at Lu Tian, his eyes sincere.

“We of the Sect of the Demon King once had two Epoch Lords, so besides Yan Haobo, there was another son of an Epoch Lord!” Yan Hongtao continued speaking. Upon finishing, Lu Tian and the others couldn’t help but gasp in shock.

“Ah… I remember now! It’s Run Hongyu!” Cao Dedu and the others’ faces showed realization, their gazes turning to Yan Hongtao.

“Run Hongyu!” Hearing Cao Dedu and the others’ words, Lu Tian’s brows furrowed slightly. He had thought Run Hongyu was a pseudonym for Yan Haobo, but it turned out there truly was such a person.

“Although he is the son of an Epoch Lord, Run Hongyu’s fate wasn’t so fortunate. Though his strength was formidable, his body had a defect.”

“Run Hongyu has the Six Yin绝脉 (Six Yin Death Pulse)!” Yan Hongtao spoke softly, his eyes filled with a hint of admiration.

“Six Yin Death Pulse!” Hearing Yan Hongtao’s words, Lu Tian and the others showed surprise, their eyes filled with disbelief.

“The Six Yin Death Pulse is a rare talent; its cultivation speed was several times faster than ordinary people. However, it had a fatal flaw—its lifespan. No one with the Six Yin Death Pulse lived beyond five hundred years!” Lu Tian thought of an ancient text describing the Six Yin Death Pulse, his eyes filled with sorrow.

Thus, every person with the Six Yin Death Pulse shone brilliantly and was unbeatable at their level. But ultimately, they vanished like a meteor in the long river of time.

“Run Hongyu was different from Yan Haobo. Since his awakening, he had remained low-key. Plus, the fact that he had the Six Yin Death Pulse was known to everyone in the Sect of the Demon King. Therefore, these elders didn’t pay much attention to him,” Yan Hongtao spoke softly.

“It’s not that I’m threatening you, but if you want to find the Bone Forest, you’ll need Run Hongyu’s help. His father once entered the Bone Forest and left a bloodline inheritance within it. Therefore, only Run Hongyu can sense the presence of the Bone Forest through his bloodline,” Yan Hongtao spoke softly, gazing at Lu Tian.

Upon hearing Yan Hongtao’s words, Lu Tian instantly understood. Yan Hongtao wanted to borrow the Immortal-Reviving Elixir to extend Run Hongyu’s life or even completely eliminate the Six Yin Death Pulse. In that case, the Sect of the Demon King would gain a powerful pillar. Moreover, from Yan Hongtao’s tone, Run Hongyu was more reliable than Yan Haobo. His character was also much better than Yan Haobo’s.

“Can you take us to meet Run Hongyu?” Lu Tian spoke softly. He wanted to personally assess Run Hongyu and see what kind of person he was. Regardless, Lu Tian had to enter the Bone Forest; this was crucial for Fu Xingxuan’s life. He wouldn’t let go of this opportunity even if he had to compromise.

“Of course, he’s in the Sect of the Demon King,” Yan Hongtao nodded, his eyes filled with a hint of joy.

“Moreover, our people have also uncovered another piece of information—about the divine clan. Do you want to hear it?” Yan Hongtao spoke again, this time with a lighter tone.

“What information?” Hearing Yan Hongtao’s words, Lu Tian and the others raised their brows. Anything that caught Yan Hongtao’s attention was surely no small matter.

“It’s not a secret. You’ve been isolated from external news in the Sect of the Demon King. Once you leave, you’ll hear it anyway. After all, this event is known throughout the Nine Domains!” Yan Hongtao spoke, his eyes indifferent.

“Tell me,” Lu Tian nodded. If it was spread across the Nine Domains, the divine clan must have undergone some change.

“Did the divine clan get wiped out?” Cao Dedu and the others speculated, as the divine clan’s strength had indeed declined significantly.

Lu Tian and his group had suspected the divine clan might face turmoil, but they hadn’t expected someone to act so quickly.

“No, but it was close,” Yan Hongtao said.

“You previously wounded the divine clan severely. The only two Epoch Lords remaining were Old Divine King Sun Shengtian and New Divine King Sun Feiwen.”

“Though their strength was formidable, the Nine Domains were no longer as they once were. Some powerful sects had also produced Epoch Lords, though not many. A single star domain might have several,” Yan Hongtao said with a smile, as he had a grudge against the divine clan and hadn’t held any goodwill toward them.

“In the Divine Beast Domain, some powerful sects were organized by someone and attacked the divine clan. Six Epoch Lords and many Epoch-level cultivators joined forces,” Yan Hongtao continued.

“At first, the divine clan was like when you attacked them, and they were driven into the Divine Mountains with heavy casualties.”

“However, Sun Shengtian eventually broke through to become a potential Epoch Lord at the crucial moment. He decisively suppressed the attackers and saved the divine clan,” Yan Hongtao spoke softly, leaving Lu Tian and his group in shock.

“Sun Shengtian broke through to become a potential Epoch Lord!” Lu Tian and the others murmured, but soon Lu Tian felt at ease. He understood why he had felt a sense of dread when he met Sun Shengtian before.

“Unexpectedly, he didn’t collapse from his son’s death but instead broke through!” Sun Mengru and the others showed admiration.

“After all, he’s an elder-level powerhouse. Just by his willpower, we can’t match him!” Lu Tian smiled slightly.

“However, even though Sun Shengtian saved the divine clan, it’s now in ruins. After several attacks driving them into the Divine Mountains, if not for this final breakthrough by Sun Shengtian, the divine clan might have been wiped out by many sects,” Yan Hongtao shook his head lightly.

“Regardless, in the long run, having another potential Epoch Lord among humans is a good thing. With a potential Epoch Lord, even if the divine clan suffers heavy losses, no one would dare to oppress them,” Lu Tian spoke softly before gazing at Yan Hongtao.

“Yan Brother, I have another request for you! Can you help me find three people?” Lu Tian spoke softly, thinking of Sun Chengyang and Nan Gong Wu Bei who had escaped.

“Who? If we can find them, we’ll definitely do so!” Yan Hongtao’s face showed confidence. He was confident in the Sect of the Demon King’s intelligence network.

“Sun Chengyang, Nan Gong Wu Bei, and Sun Miechen!” Lu Tian spoke the three names, causing Yan Hongtao’s lips to twitch.

“This… is a bit difficult. You should know that if they want to hide, finding them would be very hard. I can only try my best, but don’t expect too much!” Yan Hongtao didn’t say it outright.

“Hmph! You just boasted about your intelligence network being so strong, but now it seems nothing special. Can’t even find a person!” Cao Dedu mocked Yan Hongtao upon hearing his words.

“You…” Yan Hongtao’s face turned red and purple at Cao Dedu’s words. He had previously been proud of the Sect of the Demon King’s intelligence network.

“Alright, I’ll trouble you, Yan Brother!” Lu Tian glared at Cao Dedu and then spoke to Yan Hongtao: “We can go meet Run Hongyu now!”

“Good!” Yan Hongtao didn’t argue with Cao Dedu. He led Lu Tian and the others out of the city.

Not long after, under Yan Hongtao’s guidance, they exited the inner city and arrived at the entrance of a grand hall.

“He isn’t in the inner city?” Lu Tian and the others felt puzzled. Considering Run Hongyu’s status and strength, he should have no problem living in the inner city.

“Ah! He said he didn’t like the atmosphere of the inner city!” Yan Hongtao nodded and led Lu Tian and the others through the streets of the outer city.

Compared to the inner city, the outer city was much more lively. People came and went, and when they saw Yan Hongtao, they all bowed respectfully. Though in the outer city, people had heard about what happened and looked at Lu Tian and Cao Dedu with some hostility.

Lu Tian and the others naturally ignored their gazes, following Yan Hongtao for nearly an hour until they reached the edge of a courtyard.

“Hongyu Clinic!” They saw a sign hanging over the courtyard, their faces showing confusion.

“Unexpectedly, in this world of cultivators, there’s even a clinic like those found in the mundane realm!” Lu Tian and the others marveled.

“Ah, he doesn’t have much to do, so he lives here. He treats the killers who return injured from the Sect of the Demon King,” Yan Hongtao said with admiration, introducing to Lu Tian and the others.

“But don’t underestimate him—he’s a master physician. As long as they’re not dead, those under his care will recover, and the speed is even faster than elixirs!”

“Hmph! I don’t believe it. How could mundane medicine work on cultivators?” Zheng Xin frowned slightly.

“Such a fool! Daring to question Hongyu’s medical skills!” Zheng Xin’s words reached two young men leaving the clinic, who looked at her with disdain.

“His reputation is quite high!” Seeing these two young men defending Run Hongyu, Lu Tian smiled slightly.

“Alright, let’s go!” Yan Hongtao smiled and didn’t take the two young men seriously. After all, they were only at the Saint Stage.

“Ah!” Lu Tian and the others nodded, curious about who Run Hongyu truly was.

They entered the courtyard. It wasn’t large but was quite charming, with several attendants walking around and a few people with injuries waiting in line.

“Alright, rest for two months, and you’ll recover!” A gentle voice echoed from the room. Just by the sound alone, it felt like a breeze on a spring day.

“Hongyu Elder, I’m here!” Yan Hongbo called out to the room, his face showing a touch of respect.

“Wait until I finish these patients!” The gentle voice replied, causing Yan Hongtao’s face to show a hint of embarrassment.

“Wait a bit. That’s just how he is!” Yan Hongtao smiled and spoke to Lu Tian and the others.

“Such a strange person! We don’t have time to wait for him!” Zheng Xin’s face showed displeasure.

“Out of the way, Hongyu! Do you want to live or not? I’ll tell you…”

“Buzz…” Before Zheng Xin could finish speaking, a sound of breaking through the air echoed in their ears. Her voice stopped abruptly, and her body froze in place, unable to speak.

“This!” Seeing Zheng Xin’s expression, Lu Tian and the others’ faces changed instantly. Their gazes turned to the small room, filled with concern.

“What’s going on?” Cao Dedu and the others looked puzzled, unable to understand why Zheng Xin suddenly couldn’t speak.

“Fast!” Lu Tian murmured softly, his gaze turning to the back of Zheng Xin’s ear. A silver needle was inserted there.

Chapter 1583: Medical Skills

Lu Tian furrowed his brows, surprised that Run Hongyu had such skills—using silver needles to restrict others’ movements.

“Not simple!” Lu Tian instantly realized Run Hongyu’s talent. Ordinary people could use silver needles to subdue Zheng Xin.

After carefully observing, Lu Tian noticed not only a silver needle on the back of Zheng Xin’s ear but also several more on other parts of his body.

“Haha, I like this Run Hongyu’s personality!” Sun Kemin smiled and appeared before Zheng Xin. His face was filled with a sly glint, looking at Zheng Xin as if he were a maiden. He reached out and grabbed her.

“Hmph, this necklace isn’t ordinary!” Sun Kemin snatched the necklace from Zheng Xin’s neck and took it.

“Sun Kemin, you dare to have any shame!” Seeing Sun Kemin taking treasures from Zheng Xin, Cao Dedu and the others shouted at him.

Though they scolded Sun Kemin, their faces showed ill intent as they surrounded Zheng Xin. They grabbed her storage ring and took it.

“Clatter…” Treasures fell from their hands, leaving the people waiting in line at the clinic stunned.

“My god! This is a living treasure!” Their faces showed shock, gazing at the mountain of treasures on the ground. For them, each item was priceless. After all, they lived in the outer city of the Sect of the Demon King and weren’t high-ranking.

“This sword is nice, I’ll take it…” Cao Dedu grabbed a long sword and put it in his bag without thinking.

“This jade pendant is nice, I’ll give it to my wife! No one dare to compete with me…” Xu Lianyi muttered, grabbing a jade pendant and storing it.

“Creak!” Zheng Xin’s face was grim, his teeth clenched tightly. He watched his belongings being taken by these bastards but couldn’t move, not even able to speak. He knew that once they took it, it would be gone into a dog’s stomach.

These items weren’t priceless treasures but were rare and novel, carefully collected by Zheng Xin—precious indeed.

In the blink of an eye, they were taken nearly half, and much of it was due to them fighting over the same item.

“Silence!” A voice of annoyance echoed from the room again, humming. Cao Dedu and the others still had greedy expressions but maintained their positions.

Lu Tian’s face slightly changed, finding Run Hongyu increasingly interesting. He smiled and sat on a stone bench beside the courtyard, waving his hand to summon a pot of tea.

“This…” Yan Hongtao’s face showed surprise as he looked at the tea on the table. He walked over to Lu Tian.

“Tea made from the leaves of an Immortal-Reviving Elixir?” Yan Hongtao spoke softly, his eyes filled with admiration.
