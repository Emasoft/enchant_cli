" What's going on?" The disciples of the Xing Tang sect trembled, gazing at the gradually dissipating black vortex above the sky.

" Is this an explosion?" People stared in disbelief at Luo Tian's direction, but failed to notice his absence—Luo Tian had vanished without a trace, fleeing faster than anyone else.

" The commotion is too great! This explosion surpasses even a seventh-grade elixir!" An elder spoke, feeling that if he had been caught in the explosion's shockwave, he wouldn't have fared well.

" Damned! If it weren't for the Peak Master, I might've been caught in that explosion too..." Jiang An's lips twitched. At this moment, he had reached the stage of refining medicinal essence.

" Not good..." Jiang An's expression darkened again, his face shifting slightly as he felt the thunderous rumbling from the elixir furnace before him.

" Boom..." Before Jiang An could react, an invisible wave struck his body directly, blowing him away.

" Damn it... Is this over?" Everyone immediately assumed defensive postures, enduring the violent storm's冲击.

" Bang..." Jiang An was not so fortunate. After Jjiang Yuanxiong had just dealt with Luo Tian's explosion, he hadn't expected Jiang An to also explode suddenly. Thus, he ignored Jiang An entirely. Jiang An was thrown recklessly onto the platform, his robes torn and emitting thick black smoke.

The Tianji Flame Vessel descended from the sky onto the platform. Jiang Yuanxiong's face was dark with anger. These two weren't refining elixirs—they were causing trouble.

" Jiang An, you have one more chance. Don't explode again!" Jiang Yuanxiong spoke, secretly grateful he had set the rule of three furnaces per person. If they exploded multiple times, aside from losses, there might even be casualties.

" Terrifying... I never knew refining elixirs could be so dangerous!" Xiong Qianshan and others looked at Luo Tian and the eighth peak's alchemists with admiration. They had previously thought refining elixirs posed no life-threatening risk, but now their thoughts seemed laughably naive. Each of those three explosions could have severely wounded a late-stage True Immortal.

" It won't explode again. However, Peak Master, could you isolate me from this kid?" Jiang An stood up, wiping blood from his lips as he addressed Jiang Yuanxiong.

" Isolate what? If we isolate, then it's no longer a duel. What's the point?" Jiang Yuanxiong scoffed, returning to the crowd.

" This..." Jiang An's face fell. He had been confident before, but now he only had one chance left. If he exploded again, he would truly lose.

While Jiang An spoke, Luo Tian sat cross-legged on the ground again, pondering deeply.

" Still no good! The yin and yang still can't merge!" Luo Tian muttered to himself, redoubling his calculations.

At the same time, Jiang An took advantage of Luo Tian's calculation to focus on refining elixirs. The platform fell into silence again, only the sound of the furnace's refinement could be heard.

" No good... no good... still no good..." Luo Tian kept recalculating, his mind constantly evolving scenarios. He had forgotten everything else, fully immersed in the process.

One hour... two hours... time passed slowly. Three hours later, Luo Tian remained seated there while Jiang An's forehead was already drenched in sweat. He had reached the critical stage of forming the elixir.

Boom... boom... boom...

The thunderous sound echoed in all directions. The sky was filled with swirling clouds, and lightning crackled. It resonated with the sound of Jiang An's furnace.

" Crack..." A sharp cracking sound suddenly echoed from Jiang An's furnace. At the same time, a golden lightning bolt descended from the sky.

" Great Dao Thundering Elixir, formed!" Jiang An's eyes gleamed with solemnity. He slapped his hand forward, and a brilliant light surged skyward. A lightning bolt rose from the furnace before him, rushing toward the descending thunderclap.

The collision roared. Two golden lightning bolts clashed in people's astonished eyes, the thunderous sound echoing like a divine roar. Indeed, faint traces of heavenly power converged toward the golden elixir bathed in lightning.

As people gaped, a second bolt of lightning crashed down, colliding again. A third followed swiftly. Six bolts fell in total, as if the entire sky was wrapped in a net of lightning. Finally, the lightning snakes converged toward that golden elixir.

The lightning patterns shrank onto the golden elixir. The sky's clouds dissipated, and Jiang An's face bore a smile. He extended his hand, grasping the golden elixir into his palm.

" Great Dao Thundering Elixir, a sixth-grade elixir. A top-tier lightning cultivator's treasure. Ordinary practitioners who consume it have a chance to cultivate one of their own divine lightning for killing, while lightning cultivators who consume it can gain sixty years of cultivation!" Jiang An smiled, addressing the crowd.

" Excellent. Though it's a sixth-grade elixir, you've improved it. It contains a trace of heavenly power—this is the most precious!" Jiang Yuanxiong spoke softly.

" The Peak Master noticed it!" Jiang An's eyes gleamed with pride upon hearing Jiang Yuanxiong's words.

" You've won. Unless that kid can refine a seventh-grade elixir, even a sixth-grade one cannot match this Great Dao Thundering Elixir. It's a pity they didn't form elixirs simultaneously; we could have witnessed the duel!" Other eighth-peak elders smiled confidently.

" But what is that kid doing? Why hasn't he refined elixirs yet?" People shifted their focus to Luo Tian.

Chapter 2299: Demon Elixir()

Luo Tian sat cross-legged, his mind constantly recalculating. However, the eighth-peak elders grew impatient, their eyes showing impatience.

" Kid, can you still do it? If you can't refine one, just admit defeat. You won't win anyway. Just let us break your legs and end this!" One of the elders who had bet against Lei Yong spoke, his gaze fixed on Luo Tian sitting cross-legged.

" What's the point of arguing? You said refining elixirs, but no time limit was set. You're deliberately disturbing my younger brother's refinement. If he acts, the world will change—this Great Dao Thundering Elixir would be crushed!" Lei Yong was undeterred.

" Do you expect us to wait for years?"

" Yes, hurry up. I've waited long enough!" The eighth-peak elders mocked one by one.

" It's just a little delay!" As the eighth-peak elders ridiculed, Luo Tian opened his eyes. His cold voice echoed in everyone's ears, but his eyes carried a hint of joy. After recalculating for three hours, Luo Tian finally had some clues. He had been pondering this issue for months.

" Let's try again!" Luo Tian's eyes were solemn. Under everyone's gaze, he began refining elixirs again. The Thousand-Page Brushing Technique was employed, and a series of medicinal herbs were placed into the Tianji Flame Vessel.

" No matter what the elixir is, this technique is unparalleled. It's not like a novice at all—even I feel inferior!" Lin Yuanhang praised, speaking softly. Other elders also marveled. Though alchemists were proud, they could accept superior skills in refining elixirs.

" This technique!" Jiang Yuanxiong watched again, his eyes deepening. A flicker of excitement appeared in his gaze as he looked at Luo Tian, gradually overlapping with a memory of someone. His eyes became incredulous.

" How could it be!" Jiang Yuanxiong finally couldn't help but exclaim, startling Lin Yuanhang and others.

" Peak Master? What's wrong?" Lin Yuanhang and others quickly asked, gazing at Jiang Yuanxiong. This was the first time they had seen Jiang Yuanxiong display such an expression while watching someone refine elixirs.

" Nothing, nothing!" Jiang Yuanxiong shook his head lightly. However, his eyes remained fixed on Luo Tian, filled with excitement and a rising battle spirit.

" Recognized it?" Xuan Dan looked at Jiang Yuanxiong, naturally knowing that Jiang Yuanxiong had recognized Luo Tian's technique. It was indeed from Zhang Daotian.

" Two hundred and sixteen..." As people marveled, medicinal herbs were again placed into the Tianji Flame Vessel, beginning to be refined.

" Two hundred and seventeen..." At the same time, Luo Tian cast another medicinal herb. This one was a profoundly yin herb. Cold air radiated from Luo Tian's hands, its white leaves and flowers appearing strangely beautiful—this was the Bianhua (Hellscape Flower).

" Is he seeking death?" Seeing Luo Tian throwing the Bianhua into the furnace, eighth-peak alchemists immediately spoke.

" But what is this flower? I've never seen it before!" One elder looked puzzled, realizing he didn't recognize the Bianhua Luo Tian had thrown into the furnace.

" The Hellscape Flower from Hell!" Jiang Yuanxiong spoke softly, seemingly understanding Luo Tian's intention. However, his brows remained furrowed.

" Bianhua? He actually has the Bianhua! My heavens, isn't this a waste!" Upon hearing Jiang Yuanxiong's words, eighth-peak elders—including Lin Yuanhang—wore expressions of disbelief.

The Bianhua was rare in the Immortal World, extremely precious. Some had never even seen it.

" Boom..." The white Bianhua appeared in the Tianji Flame Vessel, radiating coldness. Luo Tian quickly refined it into a white dragon that clashed with the previous medicinal liquid.

" Demon Seed!" Luo Tian waved his hand, casting another demon seed into the furnace. A black dragon swiftly swept through.

" Roar..." The roar echoed to the heavens as three-colored dragons—black, white, and green—began colliding. The Tianji Flame Vessel roared again.

" Run! It's going to explode again!" Someone shouted, seeing the trembling Tianji Flame Vessel and recalling Luo Tian's previous explosion.

" What's the rush!" Jiang Yuanxiong's eyes showed interest, but he was prepared to act at any moment.

" Let it solidify!" Luo Tian roared, sweat pouring from his face. Yet his eyes gleamed with excitement.

Inside the Tianji Flame Vessel, three-colored dragons circled each other, neither yielding. Luo Tian seized this opportunity to compress the three-colored dragons with his vast spiritual awareness, attempting to condense them into an elixir.

At the same time, nine-colored flames swept through the furnace, aiding Luo Tian in quickly condensing the elixir. Time passed slowly. Luo Tian's spiritual awareness consumed at a terrifying speed. The Tianji Flame Vessel seemed ready to explode, but it didn't—leaving people speechless.

" It's been an hour already. You could refine another elixir by now! Why hasn't he formed one yet?" People were puzzled, watching Luo Tian's pale face.

" Is it going to explode or not? It's so scary!" Xiong Qianshan and others were also speechless, watching Luo Tian's almost-explosive appearance. They had been defending all along but it hadn't exploded.

" Boom..." As people's words were still echoing, a thunderous sound echoed in their ears. Instantly, they regained their senses. The world darkened as black clouds instantly filled the sky.

The Tianji Flame Vessel let out a deep sound. Luo Tian slammed it with his hand, and the lid flew open. A violent wave of power burst forth from the furnace, sweeping across eight directions and blowing Luo Tian's robes.

" Open!" Luo Tian roared. A black elixir flew from the Tianji Flame Vessel, accompanied by a dark demon shadow that enveloped it. The demonic energy surged.

" Crack..." A water-bucket thick golden divine lightning descended from the sky, aiming to劈 down on the black elixir. People felt an overwhelming intent to annihilate it, as if it shouldn't exist in the world.

" Demon shadows arise—this is a sign of an emerging demon!" Jiang Yuanxiong's face bore a faint admiration, watching the black shadow. He hadn't expected an elixir to cause such a commotion.

" What's going on? Who dares to perform an elixir refinement in my Butian Mountain!" At the same time, all eighteen peak masters of Butian Mountain appeared. Their gazes turned toward the Xing Tang area, even the elders of Butian Pavilion were startled by this overwhelming demonic energy.

" It's from the Xing Tang area. If I'm not mistaken, there's a demon cultivator in the Xing Tang, right?" However, when people saw it was from the Xing Tang area, they sighed in relief and returned to their residences.

" Roar..." The black shadow opened its mouth, directly swallowing the water-bucket thick lightning.

" Sizzle..." The black shadow roared. Rolling black smoke was purified by the lightning, rising in thick plumes. However, it didn't cause any substantial damage to the shadow.

" What kind of elixir is this? The divine lightning's intensity is four or five times that of Jiang An's! Could it be a seventh-grade elixir? But seventh-grade elixirs should have purple lightning!" Lin Yuanhang and others looked in shock, watching the second wave of golden divine lightning descending.

The shadow instinctively resisted the divine lightning. Each time, it roared and met each descending bolt of lightning.

" Six! Still within the sixth-grade elixir range!" After the shadow clashed with the final divine lightning and dissipated, Lin Yuanhang and others sighed in relief. The dissipating clouds signified the completion of the elixir's trial, and Luo Tian's eyes gleamed with joy. As a demon cultivator, he could feel his innate desire to devour the heavenly elixir.

" Duel Elixir!" Jiang An's face bore battle intent. He waved his hand, throwing his previously refined Great Dao Thundering Elixir toward the heavenly elixir.

Jiang An was desperate. He had believed he would win effortlessly. Even if Luo Tian's technique was outstanding, with his nine-colored human flame, Jiang An still didn't believe Luo Tian could defeat him. However, after the shadow appeared, he realized he might lose. Seeing the elixir and Jiang Yuanxiong's admiration and shock, he knew he had to take a gamble. If he didn't, he would definitely lose.

Now was the opportunity. Luo Tian's demon elixir had just formed and passed through the trial, but it wasn't yet stable—its most vulnerable moment. Jiang An's plan was to become the elixir's final trial, the last straw that would crush it.

Thus, Jiang An chose to duel elixirs. This was an环节 that shouldn't have existed—duel elixirs were meant to be simultaneous, ensuring fairness. But now it was clearly unfair toward Luo Tian.

" Clatter..." A golden elixir flew from Jiang An's hand, instantly transforming into a golden lightning bolt that rushed toward Luo Tian's demon elixir.

" You're seeking death!" Luo Tian's eyes turned cold. With his remaining spiritual awareness, he rushed out and infused it into the demon elixir. Dueling elixirs was another form of combat for alchemists.

" Boom..." The shadow that had just dissipated reformed, but this time it somewhat resembled Luo Tian.

The black shadow solidified into a tangible form and punched toward the golden lightning, causing another thunderous sound.

" Despicable!" Xiong Qianshan and others cursed. Though they didn't understand, they knew Jiang An's actions were clearly detrimental to Luo Tian.

Jiang Yuanxiong's brows furrowed slightly, but he didn't stop it. He knew Luo Tian wouldn't lose because he was the disciple of that person and couldn't be defeated by Jiang An's hands.

" Crack..." As people marveled, the black fist collided with the golden lightning.

Chapter 2300: Sect()

The black fist clashed with the golden lightning, shaking the heavens and darkening the world. A thunderous collision echoed in people's ears.

" Who wins or loses?" People then anxiously watched the confrontation above the sky, their eyes filled with awe.

Under people's astonished gaze, the golden lightning was shattered by the black shadow. A sharp crack echoed in their ears.

" Puke..." Jiang An's face instantly turned pale, blood spewing from his mouth. He clutched his head and screamed in agony.

" Cough... cough..." Luo Tian also spat out two mouthfuls of blood, his face pale but his eyes filled with joy. He extended his hand and grabbed the demon elixir from the sky.

" He won... Luo Tian won..." People's eyes were filled with awe, watching the demon elixir in Luo Tian's hand and looking at Jiang An lying on the ground, wailing.

" How could it be? What kind of elixir is this? It defeated Jiang An's Great Dao Thundering Elixir just after being formed!" Eighth-peak elders and disciples looked in shock, gazing at Luo Tian's black demon elixir.

" Nine Departures Heaven Fire Elixir. I added the Bianhua and a demon seed that had transformed into demonic energy, making it an ultimate demon elixir!"

" It can only be consumed by demon cultivators. After consuming it, one gains the equivalent of two hundred years of cultivation!" Luo Tian spoke softly, causing people to gasp.

One century was sixty years. Two centuries were one hundred and twenty years. This wasn't just a sixth-grade elixir—it was nearly as valuable as a seventh-grade one.

People looked at Luo Tian's demon elixir in silence, but they secretly marveled. This could only be consumed by demon cultivators; ordinary practitioners would certainly be corrupted.

" Excellent, excellent..." Jiang Yuanxiong's face bore a faint smile. He extended his hand and grabbed Luo Tian, disappearing from people's sight.

" This matter is over. From now on, the eighth peak and Xing Tang will live in harmony!" Jiang Yuanxiong's voice echoed in people's ears, even though he had vanished.

" Finally over!" Everyone sighed deeply. Lin Yuanhang and others naturally had no objections; this was the best outcome they could have imagined.

" That old man, our bet still stands, right?" As people sighed deeply, Lei Yong's mocking voice echoed in their ears. They had resolved the matter, but the bet still remained.

Jiang An clearly suffered heavy injuries. People knew the consequences of a duel elixir—sometimes it could even kill. However, Luo Tian and Jiang An's duel wasn't that intense, leaving Jiang An with a wounded soul. He wouldn't recover for some time.

" Uh..." Upon hearing Lei Yong's words, the elder blinked in surprise. He wore a尴尬 expression and chuckled nervously.

" Forget it. I don't like fighting. You just need to pay me some money, but it needs to satisfy me!" Lei Yong nodded generously, addressing the elder.

" This young man can rest assured. Although I haven't taken elixirs for several months, I can still afford it!" The elder laughed heartily and made a promise to Lei Yong.

" Everyone, I've instructed my disciples to prepare a banquet. Please grace us with your presence!" Zhang Ziping spoke softly, inviting Lin Yuanhang and others.

" How could we refuse the invitation of the Deputy Hall Master? We'll be honored!" Lin Yuanhang smiled lightly. Zhang Ziping had offered them a way out, so they naturally welcomed it.

Soon, the hall where Zhang Ziping and others had been sitting was filled with people. At first, everyone felt uncomfortable, but as they drank and passed the wine, Xiong Qianshan and others loosened up. The atmosphere gradually became lively.

At this moment, Luo Tian was taken to a small courtyard by Jiang Yuanxiong. His face bore confusion. Long You ran stood beside Luo Tian.

" Kid, who did you learn this elixir technique from? Where is he?" Jiang Yuanxiong asked, his voice filled with seriousness.

" I learned it from my master. As for where my master is, I don't know. I was an ascendant who hadn't reached the Immortal World before I parted ways with my master!" Luo Tian replied, his eyes filled with solemnity.

" Unexpected... unexpected. He's still alive! It's a joyous thing!" Jiang Yuanxiong's eyes bore admiration.

" You know my master?" Luo Tian's eyes narrowed slightly. He hadn't expected his use of the Thousand-Page Brushing Technique would catch Jiang Yuanxiong's attention.

" Know? I don't just know. We're old acquaintances! Your master is the only one in alchemy who defeated me!" Jiang Yuanxiong's eyes bore contemplation, recalling the formidable figure in his memories.

" Your master was once a rising star. His strength and alchemy were enough to keep the nine immortal mountains' prodigies from lifting their heads. However, it's a pity... If he had more time, the outcome might have been different!" Jiang Yuanxiong spoke, gazing at Luo Tian.

Luo Tian's eyes bore caution. He naturally knew what Jiang Yuanxiong meant. If Zhang Daotian had been given more time, the Tian Dao Mountain might not have been destroyed.

" Don't worry. I had some connection with your master, so I won't harm you. You can continue using the Thousand-Page Brushing Technique. In the entire Immortal World, no more than five people can recognize it!" Jiang Yuanxiong spoke softly.

" Thank you, Master!" Luo Tian bowed slightly. He felt Jiang Yuanxiong had no hostility toward him and was cautious, for Jiang Yuanxiong had given him a warning. If it weren't for Jiang Yuanxiong recognizing his use of the Thousand-Page Brushing Technique, he might have been in danger.

" Go back. Long You will also stay at Butian Mountain. Take care of him for me!" Jiang Yuanxiong spoke, his voice carrying a gentle touch as he lightly patted Long You's head.

" Master, where are you going?" Long You looked puzzled. He didn't understand why Jiang Yuanxiong had returned and was leaving now.

" Nothing, just strolling around. I want to find your master and fulfill a wish of mine!" Jiang Yuanxiong's eyes bore a faint smile, his voice filled with anticipation.

" Please let Master know I'm safe after finding my master!" Luo Tian spoke softly, his heart feeling bittersweet. His master needed someone else to find him.

" Yes, rest assured. If you have such an outstanding disciple, your master must be very pleased!" Jiang Yuanxiong sighed.

Luo Tian bid farewell to Jiang Yuanxiong, his heart heavy. He could sense that Jiang Yuanxiong's relationship with Zhang Daotian might be complex, and he marveled at how many people still had no news.

The Ghost King Sect. Luo Tian set his sights on the Ghost King Sect, where Gu Qianxue's traces were. However, Luo Tian knew he had just arrived at the upper three realms and that Gu Qianxue didn't recognize him.

" It's a bit complicated. Before finding Qianxue, I need to settle down Fu Xingyue, Fu Xingyang, and Tu Feiyang!" Luo Tian muttered to himself, planning his next steps.

Luo Tian walked back to the Xing Tang. Under the respectful gaze of the Xing Tang disciples, he arrived at the hall for discussing matters. Before entering the door, a series of laughter echoed from within.

Luo Tian pushed open the door and saw the Xing Tang and eighth-peak people in a lively atmosphere. The two groups had become completely familiar with each other.

" Old Zhang, it's not like I'm boasting. Back then, we brothers killed everywhere in Butian City..." Xiong Qianshan hugged an eighth-peak elder, recounting their past in Butian City.

" Old Xiong, it was all a misunderstanding. It's all because of Jiang An, that bastard! You're all heroes!" The elder hugged by Xiong Qianshan had a swollen tongue, continuing to boast and chat with Xiong Qianshan.

Luo Tian smiled lightly and quickly stepped out of the hall. He didn't want to be caught by these drunken people, as the feeling of being drunk was quite uncomfortable.

Luo Tian returned to his residence and took out the demon elixir he had previously refined. His eyes bore a hint of satisfaction.

" I have one hundred demon seeds. If the success rate is seventy percent, it's equivalent to several centuries of cultivation. Unfortunately, I don't have enough Bianhua!" Luo Tian sighed deeply. He only had a dozen or so Bianhua.

" If I had one hundred demon elixirs, it would completely allow me to enter the half-step Immortal King! I need to find an alternative for Bianhua!" Luo Tian sat cross-legged, placing the elixir into his mouth to refine it.

The next morning, Lin Yuanhang and others returned from the Xing Tang with a bitter smile. After returning to the eighth peak, their first command was to declare that the feud with Xing Tang was erased.

At the same time, Zhang Ziping withdrew the Xing Tang disciples stationed at the eighth peak, allowing the eighth peak to resume normal operations.

As this news spread, the disciples of Butian Mountain were instantly energized. For so long, they had been afraid to go to the eighth peak for elixirs, and these disciples were quite stifled.

Suddenly, the eighth peak became extremely bustling. The eighth-peak alchemists who were also stifled were delighted.

" Third-grade elixirs, take two percent; fourth-grade elixirs, take three percent!" Alchemists began setting prices. This made the disciples of Butian Mountain excited again.

" Win-win. Although this peak hadn't opened for a while, once it did open, the losses were immediately offset. It would definitely make a lot of profit!"

" And we Xing Tang also established our reputation!" In the Xing Tang hall, Zhang Ziping and others sat discussing quietly. None of them had expected such an outcome.

" Hmm, good!" Zhang Ziping nodded, gazing at the Xing Tang elders sitting there. One was missing—Luo Tian.

Zhang Ziping wasn't in the mood today. After the routine matters, he returned to his residence.

" I wonder if it will succeed. If it does, we'll have another hope!" Lei Yong was unusually serious.

" No problem. With their strength, establishing a sect is no big deal!" Ji Chen spoke softly.

The Tianyuan Sect. A sect revered by the nine regions, Luo Tian had already begun preparing to establish it.

Chapter 2301: Reencountering Nie Sheng()

Under the azure sky, several figures flew. They were Luo Tian and the Eight Shadows of the Ghost Realm, heading toward Jiutian City—the only city in the upper three realms.

Jiutian City was located at the center of the entire upper three realms. It was jointly managed by nine immortal mountains and contained a teleportation array leading to the middle three realms. It was the only one of its kind; to enter the middle three realms, you either had to cross the Huan Tian Sea or use the teleportation array. Luo Tian wanted to enter the middle three realms, so he had no choice but to take the teleportation array. After all, crossing the Huan Tian Sea was time-consuming and dangerous.

Luo Tian's scenery kept changing. His eyes bore a hint of excitement. What he needed to do was enter the lower three realms, release Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang, establish a sect in the lower three realms, and participate in the Tianzhan War decades later.

Luo Tian was confident that Fu Xingyue and Fu Xingyang could win the Tianzhan War. After all, their strength was more than enough to establish a sect in the middle three realms.

" Master, you're telling me to swallow it. If I do, my strength would definitely surge. Even an early-stage Immortal King, I could still fight!" The voice of Butian Stone echoed in Luo Tian's mind during their flight.

" Get lost. I told you not to think about this thing. If anything goes wrong, I can't cover for it! Taking this out was already a big favor!" Luo Tian's body instinctively shivered upon hearing Butian Stone's words.

One million people. Luo Tian naturally couldn't place them on Butian Mountain, so he had to choose to have Jiang Yuzhe lend the World Heart. Once in the middle three realms or lower three realms, he would release Fu Xingyue and others. However, the World Heart was a precious item. Butian Stone had been arguing with Luo Tian all along, hoping to consume the World Heart to enhance his strength. Luo Tian naturally couldn't allow Butian Stone to consume it.

If this item was lost, Butian Immortal King would definitely not let him go. The forces in the entire immortal world and even Hell's Ten Palaces that possessed World Treasures were no more than ten.

Time passed slowly. Luo Tian finally felt the vastness of the upper three realms. With his current strength, it still took seven days to reach Jiutian City.

Jiutian City was the only city in the upper three realms and was jointly managed by nine immortal mountains. Naturally, it was very large and magnificent. From afar, Luo Tian saw the high walls.

Numerous lights flew toward Jiutian City like Luo Tian. Luo Tian and his group quickly arrived at the city's gate.

The entire Jiutian City had four gates. Luo Tian and his group landed at the northern gate. As soon as they arrived, the city guards saw Luo Tian and their eyes narrowed slightly.

" Demon cultivator!" Seeing Luo Tian, two city guards' faces changed immediately. Their eyes bore solemnity and directly blocked Luo Tian.

" I am the Xing Tang Hall Master of Butian Mountain, Luo Tian!" To avoid unnecessary misunderstandings, Luo Tian waved his hand and took out the Butian Mountain's token, handing it to the two city guards.

" A young hall master!" The two city guards' eyes bore admiration. They took the Butian token and carefully examined it, finding no issues before their faces turned respectful.

" Hall Master, please!" The two young men quickly spoke. Jiutian City was run by the nine immortal mountains, so most of its residents were from the nine immortal mountains. The elders of the nine immortal mountains held high status in Jiutian City.

Luo Tian put away the token and led the Eight Shadows of the Ghost Realm into Jiutian City. As soon as he entered, his face bore a look of awe.

Luo Tian had visited many cities but none were as magnificent and beautiful as this one. It was completely like a paradise, with palaces everywhere.

" Master, the headquarters of the Central Heaven Market is here!" The Eight Shadows of the Ghost Realm looked complex as Gui Yi spoke to Luo Tian.

" Central Heaven Market?" Luo Tian's face also changed slightly. He hadn't expected this to be the headquarters of the Central Heaven Market.

" Not only that, but the entire Jiutian City is managed by the Central Heaven Market. The market's leader is also a person with extensive connections!" Gui Yi spoke to Luo Tian, making his eyes bear caution.

" It seems I need to be careful. Local snakes aren't easy to deal with!" Luo Tian muttered, but he wasn't an easy target either. As a Xing Tang Hall Master of Butian Mountain, his status was comparable to that of a middle three realms' sect leader.

Nine people walked along Jiutian City's wide streets toward the teleportation array. The city was bustling with people. Luo Tian had never seen disciples from other immortal mountains before.

Walking along the streets, Luo Tian felt Jiutian City's prosperity. The city had various shops and entertainment venues, everything one could imagine—like a paradise on earth.

" A great place!" Luo Tian looked at a pink palace. Above it stood several women, wearing light silk and exuding an alluring aura that made people want to glance at them twice.

" Damn it, get out of my way! Do you know who I am?" As Luo Tian just passed by, a shout echoed in his ears, causing him to stop.

" Bang..." The next moment, a figure was thrown out and fell onto the ground.

" I've reserved this place today! Everyone get away!" The shout echoed inside, filled with anger. Luo Tian's brows slightly furrowed.

" I've heard this voice before!" Luo Tian muttered softly, feeling the familiar voice. He stopped to watch.

" Who cares? Who can stay in Jiutian City with an ordinary status?" Another voice spoke, showing no concern for the angry shout.

In an instant, a crowd of people surrounded the area. Their faces bore curiosity, not knowing who was causing trouble here.

" Don't bother. It's the disciples of the nine immortal mountains!"

" Probably, I saw people from the Eternal Life Mountain enter earlier. Also, Fu Bei of the Eastern Emperor Mountain entered too. I guess it's these two groups that clashed!" People whispered, gazing at the people walking out of the pink palace with anger in their eyes.

" It's Nie Sheng!" Luo Tian suddenly realized. He hadn't expected to meet Nie Sheng here, the genius of the Eternal Life Mountain he had once struggled to capture.

" Nie Sheng, don't be ungrateful! Don't think others fear you. But I Fu Bei don't fear you!" The angry voice echoed.

" Step aside..." As people whispered, a middle-aged man stepped out of the crowd. Behind him were several guards. The man was seven feet tall, with a robust build and an intimidating aura. His face had several stubble lines, and his guards radiated a cold, ruthless atmosphere—this aura was very familiar to Luo Tian because his own Eight Shadows of the Ghost Realm had the same.

" It's the city guard! The personal guards of the City Lord, Zhou Jianxun!" People recognized the person and wore expressions of joy.

" Deputy Guard Commander Zhou, this matter you need to handle. These two young men fought over the head of the brothel and drove us out!" The disciples from the nine immortal mountains who had been driven out shouted immediately. These people were ordinary disciples of the nine immortal mountains, and they couldn't compare to Nie Sheng's status. It was like heaven and earth.

" Hmm, I'll check..." Zhou Jianxun's brows slightly furrowed. He listened to the people's accounts and stepped into the pink palace. People also followed Zhou Jianxun into the palace, and Luo Tian's face bore interest as he followed Zhou Jianxun into the palace. He wanted to see how Nie Sheng was doing now, as he had planted a Mind-Seed Demon in him. This was the best piece of chess Luo Tian had placed in the Eternal Life Mountain.

Entering the pink palace, a sensual atmosphere immediately enveloped them. However, two groups were spoiling the scenery.

Two groups wearing different clothes—Luo Tian saw Nie Sheng, his eyes bearing a hint of joy.

After so many years, Nie Sheng's strength had improved significantly. He was now at the late-stage True Immortal level. Although Luo Tian had planted a Mind-Seed Demon on him, Nie Sheng hadn't given up his cultivation.

The other group was entirely in white robes, radiating powerful auras—this was the genius of the Eastern Emperor Mountain, Fu Bei.
